[50:12] scriptures that we did last night just
[50:14] to catch us all up and and
[50:17] uh if you heard them last night I hope
[50:19] you don't get too weary with that but
[50:22] amen I think there's I think there's
[50:24] incredible power in the blood of Jesus
[50:27] Christ and amen sometimes just the
[50:30] simple things get overlooked and kind of
[50:33] allow us to just slip through those
[50:35] things in Isaiah chapter 53 and verse
[50:39] three amen don't you love the Lord amen
[50:45] amen amen 53 and verse three Isaiah he
[50:49] is despised and rejected of men a Man of
[50:53] Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hit
[50:56] as it were our faces from him and he was
[50:59] despised and we esteemed him not surely
[51:03] he hath borne our griefs and carried our
[51:05] sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken
[51:08] and smitten of God and Afflicted but he
[51:11] was wounded for our
[51:15] transgressions he was bruised for our
[51:17] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[51:21] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[51:26] healed
[51:27] amen let's just pray Lord Jesus we love
[51:30] you this morning and we thank you for a
[51:32] wonderful group of people that we can

[52:29] the
[52:30] questions your sins be a
[52:34] Scarlet they're white as snow I think
[52:38] sometimes we just allow that to slip
[52:39] through our lips and don't realize how
[52:41] powerful that is red like crimson and
[52:44] white like
[52:45] wool then you have no
[52:53] sin that ought just make us right there
[52:55] go have Jericho
[52:58] March because our books were full and
[53:02] God rewrote the book Thank You Lord you

[53:10] enemies want to talk about your bad old
[53:13] days that's not

[53:20] same house but that's not
[53:23] me amen no matter what what you done or
[53:28] what you do you're still
[53:34] sinless we're not Catholics here on

[54:10] brother Denny now did you get that then
[54:15] how see it through the blood the washing
[54:20] of the blood taken away separated of sin
[54:24] that the Holy Spirit Woos the believer
[54:28] through the blood cleansing of the Soul
[54:31] into the fellowship into this Spirit
[54:34] life inside with Christ shut out the
[54:38] world and the Very nature of God is in
[54:42] you still subject to mistakes but God
[54:46] can't see
[54:48] it amen I feel like shout because it's
[54:52] covered by the blood God can't see
[54:55] through the blood every time he looks
[54:58] through the blood it looks
[55:00] white he looks through the blood and it
[55:03] looks
[55:07] white so how powerful is The
[55:12] Blood let's take our camera and turn it
[55:15] back to that dark afternoon 1900 years
[55:18] ago this afternoon look at him going up
[55:22] on the hill and I can hear the
[55:24] thumping what is it it's an Old Rugged
[55:28] Cross going up the hillside it's
[55:30] dragging that Bloody Footprints of the
[55:33] bearer it's bumping over those rocks as
[55:36] it went down through the street and I
[55:38] look over his back and it's little
[55:40] specks all over that rub that robe
[55:43] without a seam and God of creation
[55:47] packing the very cross that he created
[55:51] there Emmanuel's blood has be to show
[55:54] through that through the back back and
[55:56] bigger and bigger and all at once they
[55:59] all go into one great big splash of
[56:03] blood and against his little humble
[56:05] weakly legs they begin to Splat what was
[56:09] it he's Dro he's drooping he's dropping
[56:12] his shoulder the human strength what was
[56:15] that
[56:18] God God hiding himself in Simplicity
[56:22] that was God packing that cross here he
[56:25] goes up the hill stumbling there the
[56:27] blood running out of him he fell Simon
[56:31] picked up the cross to help him with it
[56:34] and as he goes up on the hill the devil
[56:36] said you know
[56:39] what I know he's not God I know he's not
[56:45] he would never do that and I've got him
[56:48] now I've conquered every man and I've
[56:51] got him now so I know he's not God let
[56:55] me just say this to you before I break
[56:57] into this if the devil would have known
[56:59] how powerful this Blood
[57:02] was he wouldn't even scratched
[57:07] him he did not put one scratch on him
[57:10] but this blood was shed for me and
[57:14] you this Blood redeem
[57:21] mankind so he sent the bee of death to
[57:25] St him and ask the bee begin to hum
[57:28] around him you know what bees do and the
[57:31] six insects have stingers and the death
[57:34] has a stinger but you
[57:36] know but you know if an insect has it
[57:40] ever stings deep it pulls a stinger
[57:48] out Glory so if he ever anchored in a
[57:52] man an ordinary man if he's just been an
[57:56] ordinary man a prophet and he had stung
[57:59] so many prophets and he died but when he
[58:03] stung that
[58:04] one he lost his Stinger that's right he
[58:07] didn't have no more Stinger after that
[58:11] God anchored his flesh in Emmanuel and
[58:15] he pulled the stinger out of
[58:21] death oh Hallelujah in John chapter 18
[58:25] and verse
[58:27] 36 Jesus answered to
[58:30] pilate my
[58:33] kingdom is not of this world and if my
[58:37] kingdom were of this world then would my
[58:40] servants
[58:42] fight he could have called 10,000
[58:45] angels let me just say in the very
[58:49] silence and in being still he showed his
[58:52] extreme
[58:54] power amen
[58:56] he showed his extreme power by holding
[58:59] his power because he knew he had to die
[59:03] for me and for
[59:07] you he could have Cho he could have
[59:09] chose just one Angel and he would have
[59:12] change the whole
[59:15] scene then the word my servants fight
[59:18] that I should not be delivered to the
[59:21] Jews but now is my kingdom not from
[59:25] hence right presented before Pilate was
[59:29] a spotless lamb right he was without
[59:33] spot or rickle right even pilate would
[59:37] testify of this lamb I find no
[59:43] fault in
[59:46] him now listen the enemy had to
[59:52] testify the enemy had to testify
[59:58] that he was
[59:59] spotless that he had no fault in
[1:00:02] him let me go a step further let me just
[1:00:05] say your
[1:00:08] enemy your enemy though he has a memory
[1:00:12] of the old book has to see that God has
[1:00:15] so cleansed the cleansed your book and
[1:00:19] has so roding
[1:00:22] it your enemy has to testify come on
[1:00:26] that you're without spot or
[1:00:30] blemish it's not what you see it's not
[1:00:33] what you feel it's not what your
[1:00:36] neighbors see or
[1:00:38] feel God looks at you as
[1:00:44] faultless God cleared your
[1:00:47] need let me just say all of
[1:00:51] us had a lot of things against us
[1:00:57] all of us had a lot of things against us
[1:01:00] but God with his blood rewrote the
[1:01:06] book this message is a bloody word right
[1:01:11] this message is more than the law of dos
[1:01:13] and don'ts this message is not a prison
[1:01:17] house
[1:01:19] right this message brings you
[1:01:22] Liberty this message brings you Grace
[1:01:26] and God called you listen if brother
[1:01:29] brandom is standing there it's the last
[1:01:31] messenger and he's standing there before
[1:01:34] the people and he says God has called
[1:01:38] you
[1:01:44] sinless are we
[1:01:47] awake if the messenger of this
[1:01:50] day stands there and says God called you
[1:01:54] sinless right come on now I want you to
[1:01:58] just think about a realm of where he's
[1:02:01] standing as a boy he's carrying
[1:02:05] water to his father's
[1:02:08] still as a boy his family is a wretched
[1:02:12] family look down on brother brandham
[1:02:15] finds himself as a woman hater as a
[1:02:18] little
[1:02:19] boy he would have been a murderer
[1:02:22] because of his own temper but God had
[1:02:25] High
[1:02:28] plans God had higher
[1:02:31] plans that he'll walk with an angel of
[1:02:34] God much of his
[1:02:37] life listen every one of us had a
[1:02:40] history but God's got higher
[1:02:45] plans go ahead and Worship the
[1:02:48] [Applause]
[1:02:53] Lord I said I said it last night let
[1:02:56] your not your heart be troubled you
[1:02:59] believe in God believe also in me in my
[1:03:02] father's house are many mansions and if
[1:03:04] it were not so I would have told you I
[1:03:07] go to prepare a place for you and if I
[1:03:11] go and prepare a place for you I will
[1:03:13] come again and receive you unto myself
[1:03:16] that where I am there you may be also
[1:03:19] and whether I go you know and the way
[1:03:21] you know Thomas saith unto him Lord we
[1:03:24] not know know whether thou goest and how
[1:03:26] can we know the way phenomenal statement
[1:03:30] Jesus sath unto him I am the
[1:03:34] way not one of the
[1:03:37] ways there's not 50 as I said last night
[1:03:40] not 50 ways I am the
[1:03:44] way the truth and the life and no man
[1:03:48] cometh unto the father but by
[1:03:53] me verse n and Jesus Jesus said to him
[1:03:56] have I been so long time with you and
[1:03:59] yet thou Hast not known me Phillip and
[1:04:03] he that has seen me has seen the father
[1:04:07] and how thou sayest then show us the
[1:04:10] father believest not believest thou not
[1:04:13] that I am in the father and the father
[1:04:16] in me the works which that I speak unto
[1:04:19] you I speak not of myself but that the
[1:04:22] father that dwelleth in me he doeth the
[1:04:25] works believe me that I am in the father
[1:04:28] and the father in me or else believe me
[1:04:31] for the very work's
[1:04:39] sake verse
[1:04:41] 13 and whatsoever you shall ask in my
[1:04:45] name that will I
[1:04:49] do that the father May glorify the son
[1:04:53] and if you shall ask any anything in my
[1:04:57] name I will do it I want you to
[1:05:00] understand there's not a time date stamp
[1:05:04] like on your milk or on your
[1:05:09] bread or on your
[1:05:11] medicine we gave Andrew some medicine
[1:05:14] we're all doctors we're all trying to
[1:05:15] get him better and he told me he said
[1:05:17] dad this thing's been out of date for
[1:05:19] six years
[1:05:22] [Music]
[1:05:26] but the scripture doesn't have a time
[1:05:28] date
[1:05:30] stamp
[1:05:38] Glory John chapter
[1:05:42] 3 nine and Nicodemus answered and said
[1:05:46] unto him how can these things be and
[1:05:49] Jesus answered and said unto him art
[1:05:52] thou a master of Israel and knowest not
[1:05:54] these things verely verely I say unto
[1:05:57] you we speak that we do and testify that
[1:06:00] we have seen and receive not our witness
[1:06:03] if I had told you Earthly things and you
[1:06:06] believe not how will you believe if I
[1:06:08] tell you Heavenly
[1:06:10] things and no man hath Ascend it up to
[1:06:13] heaven but he that's come down from
[1:06:15] heaven even the son of man which is in
[1:06:17] heaven and I would say Nicodemus by this
[1:06:20] moment his mind is
[1:06:24] blowned you know I'm sure you
[1:06:26] experienced the same thing you're trying
[1:06:29] to tell people about the message and by
[1:06:32] the third or fourth thing their mind is
[1:06:34] just
[1:06:39] blown John chapter 3 verse 16 and
[1:06:43] everybody has it on their they can have
[1:06:45] it on their car they have it on
[1:06:46] billboards for God so loved the world
[1:06:50] right that he gave his only begotten son
[1:06:52] that that whosoever believeth in in him
[1:06:56] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:06:59] life These are next are very important
[1:07:03] for God sent his not his son into the
[1:07:06] world to condemn the world but that the
[1:07:09] world through him might be saved and he
[1:07:13] that believeth on him is not condemned
[1:07:16] but he that believeth not is condemned
[1:07:20] already because he hath not believed in
[1:07:23] the name of the only begotten of the Son
[1:07:26] of God and this is the condemnation that
[1:07:29] light is come into the world and that
[1:07:32] men love Darkness rather than light
[1:07:36] because their deeds were
[1:07:39] evil God sent Jesus into the world and
[1:07:42] they just didn't want
[1:07:44] it and because they didn't want it
[1:07:46] didn't have a desire for it did not have
[1:07:48] a predestinated seed they don't have to
[1:07:51] wait till the
[1:07:53] Judgment they're not believing already
[1:07:56] condemns it so let's come 2,000 years
[1:07:59] later God sent a
[1:08:03] prophet God sent a prophet into the
[1:08:13] world and they didn't want
[1:08:16] it they didn't want any part of
[1:08:19] it are you with me now they didn't want
[1:08:23] any part of it you don't have to wait
[1:08:24] till the Jud
[1:08:27] judement I'm sorry that's hard you don't
[1:08:30] have to wait till the judgment to figure
[1:08:32] out where you
[1:08:35] are why are we here that seed keeps you
[1:08:40] here oh brother R I'm just hanging on no
[1:08:43] you're
[1:08:43] not no you're not you're not the one
[1:08:46] hanging
[1:08:50] on you can say I quit 50 times in the
[1:08:53] but at the end of the week you're here
[1:09:01] here oh don't you love the
[1:09:05] Lord I've said I've quit a lot lot of
[1:09:08] times I quit I don't even like the
[1:09:14] preacher John 8th chapter verse 21 and
[1:09:18] then Jesus again unto them said I go my
[1:09:21] way and and you shall seek me and and
[1:09:24] die in your shall die in your sins and
[1:09:27] whether I go you cannot come and then
[1:09:30] said to the Jews will and then just said
[1:09:35] the Jews will he kill himself because he
[1:09:37] said where I go you cannot
[1:09:40] come and he said unto them I think this
[1:09:44] is so powerful and he said unto them ye
[1:09:47] are from
[1:09:51] beneath you're talking about preaching
[1:09:53] serpent seed
[1:09:58] now let me just say you better not tell
[1:10:01] your worldly friends you're from hell
[1:10:04] right that's
[1:10:06] right they're not going to understand it
[1:10:09] but you know the deal right you're from
[1:10:13] another
[1:10:16] world you can
[1:10:19] shout you're from beneath and I am from
[1:10:21] above you're this world and I am not of
[1:10:24] this world
[1:10:25] and I said therefore unto you that ye
[1:10:28] shall die in your sins for if ye believe
[1:10:32] not that I am he ye shall die in your
[1:10:37] sins if you don't believe I'm God you'll
[1:10:40] die in your
[1:10:44] sins Acts chapter 4 and verse
[1:10:47] 10 be it known unto you all and to all
[1:10:52] the people of Israel that by my name of
[1:10:55] Jesus by the name of Jesus Christ of
[1:10:58] Nazareth whom you crucified whom God
[1:11:02] raised from the dead even by him doth
[1:11:05] this man stand here before you
[1:11:09] whole this is the stone which was set at
[1:11:12] the at at the nod of you Builders which
[1:11:16] has become the head of the
[1:11:18] corner now watch this next verse neither
[1:11:21] is there salvation in any other amen
[1:11:26] there's none other name under Heaven
[1:11:29] given unto men whereby you must be saved
[1:11:34] that's I don't think it'd be put any
[1:11:37] planer than that that was one of brother
[1:11:39] Homer's favorite scriptures right
[1:11:43] there now just hang with me he said this
[1:11:47] is brother brandom he said then God
[1:11:49] himself become a Kinsman by taking on
[1:11:52] human flesh through the Virgin birth and
[1:11:55] he shed his blood that wasn't the blood
[1:11:59] of a Jew it wasn't the blood of a
[1:12:04] gentile it was the blood of
[1:12:08] God and the Bible say it says we are
[1:12:11] saved through the blood of
[1:12:15] God let me just say this to you and I'll
[1:12:17] say it again Mary's blood was
[1:12:23] toxic that's right they may worship her
[1:12:26] in Rome and there must be incredible
[1:12:29] statures of her but
[1:12:32] she was just like all Fallen
[1:12:35] men born in sin shapen in iniquity came
[1:12:40] to the world speaking lies I know we're
[1:12:42] putting scriptures together right there
[1:12:43] but brother brandom did it we'll quote
[1:12:45] him that's
[1:12:47] right she was born needing God that's
[1:12:50] right but God borrowed her womb that's
[1:12:54] right amen
[1:12:55] you're not saved by your name you're not
[1:12:57] saved by your church you're not saved by
[1:13:00] your click you can put your name on a
[1:13:03] thousand church
[1:13:05] books that doesn't save you it is the
[1:13:08] shedding of the blood of Jesus
[1:13:13] Christ that's what saves you
[1:13:25] I love this quote brother randam said
[1:13:27] someday when life is over friend he's
[1:13:30] often I've often wondered what will take
[1:13:33] place when the redeemed of all ages
[1:13:36] stand around when the crown him king of
[1:13:39] kings and Lord of lords when the angels
[1:13:43] with

[1:14:13] heads not knowing what we're talking

[1:33:37] 269 you're standing
[1:33:43] completely you never
[1:33:47] sinned at the first place you say where
[1:33:50] was the first place at before before the
[1:33:54] foundation
[1:33:56] right it wasn't when you two years old
[1:34:00] before the foundation of the world right
[1:34:04] God took a picture of you it wasn't when
[1:34:07] you 16 17 18 years old when you was
[1:34:10] acting ugly but God took a picture of
[1:34:12] you before the foundational world that's
[1:34:15] how he looks at
[1:34:22] you God don't even know nothing about it
[1:34:26] let me let me just let me just let me
[1:34:28] just I'm sorry let me just tell you if
[1:34:31] God knows every
[1:34:33] tick tick I'm talking about an animal
[1:34:36] here for y'all overseas if he knows
[1:34:39] every fly every
[1:34:41] mosquito every
[1:34:44] bat and every time that he bats his eyes
[1:34:47] and The Sparrows he watches over
[1:34:51] them he's telling you
[1:34:54] by a prophet of God that is bringing a
[1:34:57] church bringing a bride out of the
[1:35:02] church that has been married to a church
[1:35:05] organization and that had to die away
[1:35:08] from you now you stand as
[1:35:14] virtuous you never did
[1:35:17] it you were accused of it by the accuser
[1:35:22] but really from the beginning you were
[1:35:25] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[1:35:27] of God you're standing there
[1:35:32] washed I'm GNA borrow from another quote
[1:35:35] you never were a
[1:35:40] pig you may have Waller with pigs but
[1:35:43] you never was a
[1:35:45] pig you always was a son and daughter of
[1:35:49] God
[1:35:50] [Applause]
[1:36:00] if you're standing there
[1:36:04] washed and your old book of divorcement
[1:36:07] is put away it's dead absolutely out
[1:36:11] absolutely out of existence even in the
[1:36:14] mind of God you are The Virtuous bride
[1:36:17] of Christ washed in the blood of Christ
[1:36:20] precious virtuous sinless of the son of
[1:36:23] God standing with a pure unadulterated
[1:36:26] Bride of the word and he Washed by the
[1:36:29] Water of his own blood that's how
[1:36:32] powerful the blood
[1:36:35] is it just didn't patch you
[1:36:40] up it just didn't fix you it transformed
[1:36:46] you you have become a new creature in
[1:36:50] Jesus
[1:36:52] Christ amen
[1:36:55] that become flesh and manifested that he
[1:36:58] might take you which was predestined
[1:37:00] into the bosom of the father before the
[1:37:03] beginning the same as he was he was that
[1:37:08] great attribute of God Called
[1:37:14] Love Can you can I give you one more
[1:37:19] quote I'll take a little longer nap

[1:37:37] heart I'll see her tomorrow I hope it
[1:37:48] continues you ready for
[1:37:51] this and that's the way with the real
[1:37:55] Christian did you know a real Christian
[1:37:58] doesn't have even a
[1:38:00] sin at all imputed to
[1:38:05] him you ought to be SLA you ought to be
[1:38:08] slapping the leg like like we was at at
[1:38:10] that preaching
[1:38:12] service now that's real preaching right
[1:38:14] there that's real I got this talking
[1:38:15] about Stonewall Jackson and they got the
[1:38:17] slap in their legs and now that's real
[1:38:21] preaching you that right
[1:38:25] brother Homer would have loved to been
[1:38:27] in on on that
[1:38:28] one did you really know that a real
[1:38:34] Christian did you know a real Christian
[1:38:36] doesn't have even any sin at all imputed
[1:38:41] to
[1:38:45] him David said blessed of the man who
[1:38:49] God will not impute sin to
[1:38:54] when you're washed in the blood of the
[1:38:57] Lamb not by make belief but really the
[1:39:01] blood of the Lamb God does not impute
[1:39:05] sin impute to you anything that's done
[1:39:09] because you're under the
[1:39:11] blood and he doesn't see
[1:39:14] it I want to ask you why do you look for
[1:39:19] it let's just be honest then why do you
[1:39:22] look for it
[1:39:24] why you dig around in the bones God
[1:39:27] doesn't see
[1:39:29] it this is under the seventh seal under
[1:39:32] the third pull he's telling you I don't
[1:39:35] look at your
[1:39:36] sins I don't look at your mistake listen
[1:39:40] this is foundation preaching right here
[1:39:43] I prach I preached it for near 40 years
[1:39:45] now why should I change
[1:39:51] [Applause]
[1:40:00] there's a blood
[1:40:02] sacrifice and the only thing that he can
[1:40:06] see you in is the way that he saw you
[1:40:10] before the foundation of the
[1:40:15] world Lord help me
[1:40:18] behave when he put your name in the
[1:40:21] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:40:23] that's all that he can look at because
[1:40:26] you were redeemed and from everything
[1:40:29] that that was ever done you're Washed by
[1:40:33] the blood of the Lamb therefore there's
[1:40:35] no G in you there's no inclean habit in
[1:40:38] you because the blood of the Lamb has
[1:40:42] did this and God cannot impute
[1:40:46] sin to you after you've all got sin
[1:40:50] offering laying there waiting for you
[1:40:56] okay I need an example brother Ry
[1:41:07] okay my
[1:41:09] mentor I saw him do it in a lot of
[1:41:18] conventions he said this one
[1:41:21] page separates you from your old
[1:41:27] life in the Old Testament
[1:41:31] Abraham laughed at
[1:41:35] God he rolled around on the and laughed
[1:41:38] at
[1:41:39] God he
[1:41:42] lied but in Romans chapter
[1:41:46] 4L it said there was nothing imputed
[1:41:49] unto
[1:41:51] Abraham and he staggered not at the
[1:41:54] promises of
[1:41:56] God how important is this
