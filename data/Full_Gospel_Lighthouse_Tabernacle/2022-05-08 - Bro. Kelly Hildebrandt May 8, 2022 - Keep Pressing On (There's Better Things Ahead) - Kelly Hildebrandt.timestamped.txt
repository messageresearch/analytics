[18:04] morning
[18:09] before we go to prayer i just want to
[18:10] share a story
[18:12] a quick testimony about uh here a couple
[18:14] weeks ago
[18:15] when we were going down me and sarah
[18:16] were going down to louisiana for the the
[18:19] youth meeting there
[18:21] me and me and sarah were really wanting
[18:22] to go and wanting to be a part of those
[18:25] meetings and
[18:26] when i got this new position there was
[18:27] some training that got pushed back and
[18:30] there was some training that got put
[18:31] pushed into place there that same week
[18:34] so we discussed it and was
[18:36] uh we were we were thinking you know
[18:37] would it be okay if we go we won't be
[18:39] able to leave till that friday evening
[18:40] or that saturday we'll miss most of the
[18:42] meeting and she said you know yeah let's
[18:45] let's go ahead and make the trip maybe
[18:47] we can see our friends down there stay
[18:48] with them for a little bit and so we we
[18:51] decided to go ahead and try and put the
[18:53] put the flight into place and
[18:55] we couldn't get it on that friday
[18:56] afternoon um so we we ended up being
[18:59] able to the
[19:01] earliest flight we could get the only
[19:02] flight we could get was that saturday at
[19:04] 11
[19:05] and so we said let's just take it we'll
[19:07] be able to make the trip get there right
[19:09] on time for service and i'll be able to
[19:11] be there for ron and hear him and then
[19:13] hear brother andrew on sunday morning
[19:16] so at friday night after the training i
[19:18] was i was back at the house and i was
[19:20] just listening to brother donny and i
[19:21] was praying and i said you know lord
[19:24] i want you to move in a supernatural way
[19:26] this weekend i know there's already
[19:28] supernatural things going on and many
[19:30] things going on in the meetings already
[19:32] but i want you to move in a supernatural
[19:33] way and what i didn't realize is god was
[19:35] going to place me and sarah and it had
[19:37] always been
[19:38] it had already been put into place he
[19:40] was gonna put us in a position that he
[19:41] was gonna use us and
[19:43] matter of fact i really once we got on
[19:45] the flight you know i was ready to go
[19:46] back kick back and go to sleep
[19:49] and as we got on the plane um
[19:52] this
[19:53] this uh guy sitting down beside us very
[19:55] aggressive like when he sat down i
[19:58] actually leaned over to sarah and i said
[19:59] you know there's a very dark spirit
[20:00] about this uh this guy
[20:04] you know i knew he had about an hour and
[20:05] a half long trip i really wasn't to sit
[20:08] down
[20:08] i just wanted to kick back and go to
[20:10] sleep not have any issues and he kept
[20:12] sitting up leaning forward sitting up
[20:13] leaning forward sitting back against the
[20:15] seat
[20:16] and so i just put my headphones in as i
[20:18] normally would kickback was going to
[20:21] sleep well she leaned over to me and
[20:22] said you know i think he's a musician
[20:24] he's listening to songs and he would go
[20:27] back to his notes and type it
[20:29] so i would i'm i got nosy and i said
[20:32] well i just want to see what he's
[20:32] writing i want to see what kind of song
[20:33] he's writing
[20:35] and so i i stayed where i was at and he
[20:37] would lean forward he popped his notes
[20:38] open and was was typing those notes
[20:41] and
[20:42] i read the first line to one of those
[20:44] notes and he would open it and show it
[20:45] real quick when i read the first line
[20:47] i didn't believe what i was reading
[20:49] and i said lord there's no way like you
[20:51] know if that's if that's what he's
[20:52] writing and that's why you have us on
[20:54] this flight you're gonna have to give me
[20:56] the words to say because i'm not sure
[20:58] how to even go about starting this
[21:00] conversation but if you've put us here
[21:01] for that purpose if this is why we're
[21:03] late to get into these meetings you're
[21:05] gonna have you're gonna have to give me
[21:06] the words to say
[21:08] and as soon as i prayed that i i watched
[21:11] him and then he
[21:12] pulled it back up and he left it on that
[21:14] on the very top of that note
[21:16] and the line that i saw he had
[21:18] highlighted it moved it to the bottom
[21:20] and that very first note
[21:22] the line the first sentence that he put
[21:23] in that
[21:24] he said
[21:26] if you're reading this i'm no longer
[21:27] alive
[21:29] and he scrolled all the way down to the
[21:31] bottom
[21:32] and the line that he had moved
[21:34] said so i killed myself
[21:37] and the guy was sitting right beside us
[21:39] writing his suicide note
[21:41] well immediately just as it is right now
[21:43] my heart my heart just started beating
[21:44] out of my chest i'm like all right well
[21:46] that's
[21:47] all right this is why we're here you're
[21:48] gonna have to you're gonna have to give
[21:49] me the words to say
[21:51] and um
[21:53] so i didn't mention anything to sarah
[21:55] and i was thinking the whole time you
[21:56] know if this goes wrong
[21:58] we've got another hour 45 minutes we've
[22:00] got our long trip with this guy
[22:03] and but then it hit me you know well if
[22:05] it goes right you need enough time to
[22:06] talk to him
[22:08] so i just i bumped him
[22:10] gave it a couple more minutes and then i
[22:11] just went ahead and bumped him again and
[22:13] i said i sorry buddy i don't mean to
[22:14] keep hitting you
[22:16] and he just kind of looked up he had
[22:17] real dark circles under his eyes and i
[22:19] began talking to him and uh asking what
[22:22] he was doing where he was coming from he
[22:23] had a toronto hat on and so he said his
[22:26] dad was from canada
[22:28] and
[22:29] the story started out he was going to
[22:31] houston and by the end of the story he
[22:33] was going to florida i'm really not sure
[22:34] if he really cared where he was going to
[22:37] but he was making the trip down and i
[22:38] began speaking to him sarah began
[22:40] speaking to him about
[22:42] what he did in his life what job he did
[22:44] and just kind of connecting there with
[22:46] him and um and then he turned to us and
[22:48] he said well what are you guys doing and
[22:49] he kind of opened that door and i said
[22:51] we're going down here to a church
[22:53] meeting now i'm down in louisiana and i
[22:55] said we're going to listen to my uncle
[22:56] preach
[22:57] and
[22:58] i said you know he actually has stage
[23:00] four cancer and two years ago they gave
[23:02] him four months to live
[23:04] and
[23:05] said you know the doctors here recently
[23:07] told him
[23:08] are you ready to give up
[23:10] and he told them and he's told us the
[23:12] same thing
[23:14] no i'm not going to give up this life's
[23:15] worth fighting for
[23:17] and he i told him i said you know i've
[23:20] sat and watched him and he goes through
[23:21] battles and he's got a life sentence
[23:22] over his head and he's taking all these
[23:24] treatments but he's still fighting
[23:26] because this life's worth fighting for
[23:29] and i said you know we get caught up in
[23:31] all the the nonsense of the world and we
[23:33] get caught up in the things of the world
[23:34] of who's around us and said people now
[23:36] they care about the money that they're
[23:38] making they care about everything else
[23:40] other than the person sitting next to
[23:41] them and we need more people that care
[23:43] about the people that's sitting next to
[23:44] us because we don't know what they're
[23:46] fighting
[23:47] and so then we went on talking it got a
[23:49] little quiet i leaned back over to him
[23:50] and i said the plane was landing i said
[23:53] remember
[23:54] this life's worth fighting for
[23:56] it's life's worth fighting for
[23:58] and he just put his head down he said
[23:59] yeah
[24:00] well as we were getting up he went back
[24:03] to that note highlighted that entire
[24:05] note
[24:05] and deleted the whole thing
[24:08] and
[24:11] as we were getting off the plane i told
[24:12] him you know we had we had to get to our
[24:14] next trip
[24:15] and as we were
[24:16] getting off i heard him and he was
[24:18] upbeat and he was chipper he was talking
[24:20] to the people getting off the flight
[24:21] completely different from how he was
[24:23] when he got on
[24:24] and we were already taking off at a
[24:27] pretty quick pace to get to our next
[24:28] flight so we didn't miss it and he
[24:30] called back out to us and he said gabe
[24:32] sarah
[24:33] and i turned around and he said
[24:35] be safe have a good trip well i went
[24:37] back i shook his hand and i said
[24:39] everything's gonna be okay you just keep
[24:40] fighting like you know keep fighting and
[24:42] doing what you're doing and he shook my
[24:44] hand and uh we hugged each other up and
[24:47] he said thank you thank you seriously
[24:49] thank you
[24:50] and you know when i think about that you
[24:51] know
[24:52] it took me stepping out of my comfort
[24:53] zone and all of us here we don't know
[24:55] where god's going to put us and a lot of
[24:57] times we may have to step out of our
[24:58] comfort zone to be able to reach that
[24:59] person next to us and it may be a
[25:01] conversation that's hard a conversation
[25:03] that i've never had it's a note that
[25:05] i've never actually even read even when
[25:06] it comes to in the line of work that i
[25:08] work in i haven't even ever read one and
[25:10] as i'm reading it just hit me we don't
[25:12] know what everybody's fighting everybody
[25:14] has a different battle and as we heard
[25:16] last night
[25:17] you know the every battle that we have
[25:20] it may come it may come um even for us
[25:22] here and may be holding us back from the
[25:24] blessing that god gives us and i'm
[25:26] believing that this morning if there's
[25:27] any anything any any minute detail
[25:29] that's in our life that we can release
[25:31] i'm believing that we can we can let go
[25:33] of that this morning and have a closer
[25:35] walk from with god after after this
[25:37] meeting this morning
[25:39] let's just go to prayer
[25:42] gracious heavenly father lord we just
[25:44] thank you for what you're doing for us
[25:45] in these services and we thank you for
[25:47] the minister of the hour that has flown
[25:49] all these ways he's he's traveled a
[25:52] million miles and lord jesus just as we
[25:54] heard last night we knew the we knew the
[25:56] warning that he gave to us the last time
[25:58] he brought a coin and even he may not
[26:00] even realize the how how important that
[26:03] coin would be as he would as that coin
[26:05] would say full victory
[26:06] and then last night as he comes and he
[26:08] brings that statue of david
[26:10] and he's standing on the head of goliath
[26:12] lord
[26:13] and as we have it play across before the
[26:15] services
[26:17] goliath's last day
[26:19] lord jesus i just know and i believe
[26:21] that this is more than just another
[26:23] service this is more than just another
[26:25] weekend i'm believing that every prayer
[26:27] request that has been brought forth this
[26:29] morning every prayer request that may be
[26:31] spoken or unspoken can just be delivered
[26:33] because lord jesus we believe in a god
[26:35] that is the same yesterday today and
[26:37] forever and lord jesus i'm just
[26:39] believing that you will just come down
[26:40] and just use this minister like you've
[26:42] never used him before
[26:44] give him more energy more than he's ever
[26:45] had before that he can just bring forth
[26:47] the message of the hour that we are
[26:48] needing to hear and whatever his desire
[26:51] of his heart is i'm believing that he
[26:52] would just speak speak that in in a
[26:55] mighty powerful way that you could just
[26:57] speak to our heart you know exactly what
[26:59] each and every one of us needs it may be
[27:00] a lost loved one it may be a physical uh
[27:03] physical condition it may be a surgery
[27:05] or sickness that we are fighting this
[27:07] morning but whatever it is i just ask
[27:09] that you just anoint the people that
[27:11] whatever we're fighting this morning
[27:12] that we can just let loose to that thing
[27:14] forgive us of anything that may be
[27:15] hindering us from where we are at and
[27:17] our walk with you i ask that you will
[27:19] just forgive us and and allow us to move
[27:21] closer to you lord jesus because your
[27:22] mercy it covers all lord and i just ask
[27:25] that you will just move across and
[27:26] anoint the audience anoint the minister
[27:28] of the hour this morning that you will
[27:30] just come and speak to our lives we just
[27:32] thank you for what you were already
[27:34] doing we thank you for what you were
[27:35] going to do lord jesus because it is
[27:37] already done it is already finished lord
[27:39] jesus and the healing's there and i'm
[27:41] just believing for a full complete
[27:43] miracle a full complete victory of our
[27:45] pastor lord and that sugar as it may
[27:47] fight them as the as the tumors the the
[27:50] medicine what everything that is
[27:51] fighting against our pastor i believe
[27:53] that one of these days that bell will be

[43:58] note to the mothers that if anybody that
[44:00] wasn't here last evening uh sister
[44:03] connie and the sisters uh have something
[44:05] for you
[44:07] after service today if you didn't
[44:09] receive receive your gift last evening
[44:12] you can just meet sister connie at the
[44:13] back door
[44:14] and just uh just a little testimony
[44:16] before we go forward with a couple more
[44:18] announcements quickly
[44:20] this week we again we're always
[44:23] constantly reminded how powerful life is
[44:26] and how wonderful that it is to have the
[44:29] vision of isaac to be with us but again
[44:32] this week sister whitney had to go to
[44:34] the doctor
[44:35] and sister whitney has actually
[44:37] just just the lord has done something
[44:39] spectacular for her in the last little
[44:41] bit she she'd had quite a bit of issues
[44:44] with different things that she could and
[44:46] couldn't eat and different allergies to
[44:48] different things
[44:49] but ever since the prayer line last last
[44:51] week at the tent meeting she's been able
[44:53] to eat anything and everything's that
[44:55] she wants
[44:56] [Applause]
[44:57] hallelujah
[44:59] for those that know it's a great miracle
[45:02] it's a great miracle
[45:04] but
[45:05] while she was at the doctor the doctor
[45:08] the doctor was looking over her
[45:10] exam and different things and was just
[45:13] just bombarded with the the thought of
[45:16] how amazing that it is she's she spoke
[45:20] these words i'm just i'm flabbergasted
[45:22] that you are able to have children
[45:25] because all of your female organs she
[45:27] said it's it's usual it can be usual for
[45:29] somebody's organs to be twisted but for
[45:31] somebody's organs to be twisted and
[45:34] flipped backwards it's uncommon and
[45:36] there's no way that you should have been
[45:37] able to have children
[45:39] but our god who is rich in mercy
[45:42] saw fit that there would be seed brought
[45:44] forth in this day to this we are
[45:46] thankful
[45:48] to this we are thankful
[45:50] amen
[45:52] amen
[45:53] god is so good to us
[45:55] we'd like to welcome brother joseph and
[45:58] his family with us
[45:59] they they're originally from minnesota i
[46:02] understand and they will be so
[46:03] journeying with us they he has a job in
[46:06] charlottesville and he'll be so
[46:07] journeying here with us in the in the
[46:09] shenandoah valley so we want to make him

[46:14] just want to greet you and say you're
[46:15] welcome here and we love you with the
[46:17] love of the lord may god richly bless
[46:19] you amen
[46:28] also next sunday we will be having a
[46:31] baptism brother roy if you wouldn't mind
[46:33] filling the baptismal tank for us
[46:36] for that uh that will be next sunday
[46:38] after the service so anybody that would
[46:40] like to be baptized and take on the name
[46:42] of the lord jesus christ
[46:44] just send us a note that way we don't
[46:46] miss anybody that does want to i know
[46:48] that we have one as of right now but
[46:50] anybody else that would desire to take
[46:53] on the name of the lord it's it's one of
[46:55] the ordinances that our lord left us to
[46:57] do and we want to do that because it's a
[47:00] it's a sign that you're not just taking
[47:02] on you're not just taking on a man's
[47:04] name but you're taking on the name of
[47:06] heaven and it's the most powerful name
[47:08] that there is there's no other name
[47:10] where men should be saved but by the
[47:13] name of the lord and then that that day
[47:16] we will also have communion so we will
[47:18] fulfill two ordinances that day will
[47:20] have communion and then we will have the
[47:22] baptism shortly after we will run the
[47:25] the communion as we have done in the
[47:26] past but we'll let you come through and
[47:29] then go back to your pews
[47:31] and then take your seat or just wait
[47:33] until we're all through and then we'll
[47:34] partake of it together
[47:36] amen so we're just looking for these
[47:38] things i trust that we are ready for the
[47:40] rapture of the lord and i i i'd be happy
[47:44] if we don't get to fulfill these
[47:45] commitments that we're making but we
[47:48] just go right here this morning
[47:50] amen are you looking for him this
[47:52] morning amen would you stand with us
[47:54] this morning listening that song that i
[47:55] could still go free
[47:57] you can lock me up in the prison as
[47:59] brother kelly hildebrandt comes and
[48:00] makes his way
[48:02] wasn't last night just prophetic
[48:05] i was so blessed last evening to just to
[48:08] hear the word of the lord and i have to
[48:10] tell you my heart is excited this
[48:12] morning to hear what god has for us as
[48:14] brother kelly comes let's just set the
[48:16] atmosphere and the atmosphere is already
[48:18] said
[48:19] but let's just enter into a place of
[48:21] worship and
[48:23] you know i got a note this morning
[48:24] criticizing our worship
[48:27] and i you know i wouldn't normally i
[48:30] normally wouldn't say anything about it
[48:32] but somebody was criticizing our sound
[48:34] of freedom
[48:36] and our signature that we have up here
[48:39] on this board that they were making
[48:40] criticism about those things
[48:43] but i have to say you pardon the noise
[48:45] it's just our sound of freedom
[48:49] [Applause]
[48:52] hallelujah
[48:53] [Music]
[48:53] [Applause]
[48:56] you know david said in first chronicles
[48:59] 25 i was reading this this morning
[49:00] because the lord was prepping me before
[49:02] i wrote this idiot back this morning
[49:05] it said moreover david and the captains
[49:07] of the host separated to service
[49:10] of the sons of asaph and of the human
[49:13] and of jeddah
[49:15] who should prophesy with harps and with
[49:17] sultry and with symbols and the number
[49:20] of the workmen according to their
[49:21] service was so the bible says to
[49:24] prophesy with harps
[49:26] to prophesy with symbols
[49:29] so if we accept these words if we accept
[49:32] the anointed songs in the right way they
[49:34] will be prophecy unto us so songs are
[49:37] not just songs music is not just mere
[49:40] music but the bride of jesus christ is
[49:43] in a state of worship brother branham
[49:45] said after the seals that everything
[49:47] would be worshipped so thou must
[49:49] prophesy son of man thou must prophesy
[49:51] again so let us worship
[49:55] well you can

[52:26] his way
[52:29] and said

[56:45] difference

[56:51] i feel a little bit like that man by the
[56:53] gate called beautiful when he got his
[56:55] his feet underneath him he started to
[56:57] run
[56:58] he had a reason to run he was bound in
[57:00] that condition for a long time but when
[57:02] he had freedom he exercised his ability
[57:06] of freedom
[57:07] when we've been released from what we've
[57:09] been released from i'm not going back to
[57:12] that old stuff
[57:13] no sir there ain't no life in it i want
[57:16] to be where god is and where god is
[57:18] there's life and he's moving and the

[1:03:05] amen sister meyer myself will be
[1:03:07] traveling back home to canada in a few
[1:03:09] days
[1:03:10] we're just going to enjoy a little bit
[1:03:12] of the
[1:03:12] southern beauty and the things that you
[1:03:14] all have and we kind of enjoy it when we
[1:03:17] come down here i have to it's colder
[1:03:19] here than at home right now and
[1:03:22] i don't know what's going on with this
[1:03:24] weather thing i thought for sure we're
[1:03:25] going to have snow or something out
[1:03:27] there this morning but it sure felt like
[1:03:29] it and your humidity kind of bites you a
[1:03:32] little bit we're not too used to that
[1:03:34] we have more of a drier heat
[1:03:36] our dryer cold if you want to call it
[1:03:38] that
[1:03:40] when we're minus 20 celsius and you're
[1:03:42] close to the same
[1:03:43] we'd be feeling a lot warmer than you
[1:03:45] all i know it sounds very strange but
[1:03:47] it's just because it's a dry cold
[1:03:50] but
[1:03:51] it's good to be here anyhow we're not
[1:03:53] green yet where we are we're still
[1:03:55] coming to that part
[1:03:57] but springtime i love springtime because
[1:03:59] it speaks of resurrection time
[1:04:02] it's just a wonderful wonderful thing so
[1:04:04] we're going to be going for a couple of
[1:04:06] days with ron's sister connie and we
[1:04:08] enjoy doing that and we appreciate that
[1:04:12] and but if you ever have a moment in the
[1:04:13] lord ladies sister meyer myself and your
[1:04:15] hearts just say a little prayer for us
[1:04:17] that's
[1:04:18] one of the biggest compliments that you
[1:04:20] could give us is to breathe our name in
[1:04:22] prayer at some point so we certainly do
[1:04:25] would do appreciate that
[1:04:27] if we don't see you here on this side of
[1:04:29] glory
[1:04:30] look for us on the other side
[1:04:32] i'ma look a little different when i get
[1:04:34] on the other side but
[1:04:35] i remember one place where brother brown
[1:04:37] says when you go to shake someone's hand
[1:04:39] you're going to know their name at that
[1:04:40] moment i'm looking forward to that part
[1:04:43] because we'll know one another and i'll
[1:04:45] be looking for you you'd be looking for
[1:04:47] us and
[1:04:48] at that day it'll be such a grand day
[1:04:50] and it's not just going to be a short
[1:04:52] time we're going to have a thousand year
[1:04:54] honeymoon time
[1:04:56] i'm think of the couple that just got
[1:04:57] married and and they're one in their
[1:04:59] honeymoon of course it's a short time
[1:05:01] but you know the bible says when a man
[1:05:02] gets married to a woman he should take
[1:05:04] one year off of work
[1:05:06] that's kind of the scripture
[1:05:09] i i tell the young brothers at home but
[1:05:10] i
[1:05:12] i suppose the bible says you're supposed
[1:05:14] to comfort your wife
[1:05:16] i think that's a good idea but
[1:05:18] of course we don't get to do that but
[1:05:20] the lord's really going to give it to us
[1:05:22] he's going to give us a whole thousand
[1:05:24] years where we'll have a time together
[1:05:26] with the lord
[1:05:28] amen it's not going to be a wonderful
[1:05:30] wonderful time
[1:05:32] amen if you have your bibles this
[1:05:33] morning if we could if we want to stand
[1:05:36] for the reading of the word i'd like to
[1:05:38] read from romans chapter 15 today and
[1:05:42] and i'd like to actually start reading
[1:05:44] if we could
[1:05:46] from from verse 8
[1:05:49] and then i'd like to move down to verse
[1:05:51] 13 and
[1:05:52] and pull up a bit of a text out of verse
[1:05:54] thirst 13.
[1:05:57] i was encouraged this morning one of the
[1:05:59] first songs that was sung in in the
[1:06:01] service this morning was i'm going in
[1:06:04] the rapture
[1:06:05] i'm going in the rapture before we read
[1:06:07] our scripture verse i'd like you to look
[1:06:09] at your neighbor and say i'm rapture
[1:06:11] material
[1:06:13] you look at the one beside you i'm
[1:06:15] raptured material
[1:06:17] what we are we're rapture material
[1:06:20] you say it don't look like a brother
[1:06:22] kelly we're rapture material
[1:06:25] i look at it that this is what god has
[1:06:28] has spoken this is what it is and we're
[1:06:30] going in the rapture
[1:06:32] amen we expect to be in there do we
[1:06:34] expect to be there
[1:06:36] amen then we're going to press forward
[1:06:38] with all that's within our heart amen
[1:06:41] let's just read this morning it says now
[1:06:43] i say that jesus christ was a minister
[1:06:46] of the circumcision for the truth of god
[1:06:48] to confirm
[1:06:50] the promises made unto the fathers
[1:06:52] and that the gentiles might glorify
[1:06:56] god it doesn't say that we're going to
[1:06:57] be sad
[1:06:59] and have and just said but he says we're
[1:07:02] going to glorify god for his mercy
[1:07:05] as it is written for this cause i will
[1:07:08] confess to thee
[1:07:10] among the gentiles and saying unto thy
[1:07:12] name and again he said
[1:07:15] rejoice let's rejoin let's say rejoice
[1:07:18] rejoice he gentiles with his people and
[1:07:22] again my
[1:07:24] praise the lord all you gentiles and
[1:07:26] lord him all you people
[1:07:28] and again isaiah saith there shall be a
[1:07:31] root of jesse and he that shall rise to
[1:07:34] reign among the gentiles in him
[1:07:37] shall the gentiles trust
[1:07:39] well there's only one person i trust
[1:07:41] that's him
[1:07:43] amen because the gentiles are going to
[1:07:45] trust in christ jesus which is the word
[1:07:47] now i'd like to take a text here and now
[1:07:49] the god of hope
[1:07:51] fill you
[1:07:52] with all joy and peace in believing
[1:07:55] that you may abound in hope through the
[1:07:59] power
[1:08:00] of the holy ghost
[1:08:01] god bless you you may have your seats
[1:08:03] this morning
[1:08:05] that's incredible text that we just
[1:08:07] wrote
[1:08:08] read this morning
[1:08:10] that that paul had written
[1:08:12] and and i would say that it's something
[1:08:15] that that is settled within our heart
[1:08:17] we rejoice in what the work of calvary
[1:08:20] produced for us as a gentile people
[1:08:23] it is what actually puts us into the
[1:08:25] position of the bride
[1:08:27] being a part of him we come out of him
[1:08:30] at calvary now there's a few words here
[1:08:32] that i if you have your bible still open
[1:08:34] to romans 15 13 i'd like to just just
[1:08:37] highlight if i could for a moment it
[1:08:38] uses the word abound the word abound is
[1:08:42] an incredible word in the greek it means
[1:08:46] to it's it to me it refers to a flower
[1:08:50] that's going from a bud
[1:08:52] to full bloom
[1:08:54] one reason i love springtime is because
[1:08:57] the tulips start coming up around the
[1:08:58] house and the different flowers that
[1:09:00] that you planted maybe many many years
[1:09:03] ago but they're faithful every year they
[1:09:05] come up faithfully every year and you
[1:09:07] watch them come out of the ground and
[1:09:09] you can't watch them come into a bud
[1:09:11] position
[1:09:12] but in time of maturity that particular
[1:09:16] bud is going to come into a full bloom
[1:09:18] flower
[1:09:19] it really refers a lot to our personal
[1:09:22] walk with jesus christ we start with the
[1:09:24] lord and we start in our emphases and we
[1:09:27] move up into a position of a bud but it
[1:09:29] comes a time within our own christian
[1:09:32] walk with the lord where we actually
[1:09:34] start to bloom and come into a full
[1:09:37] maturity
[1:09:38] into a place where somebody can actually
[1:09:41] take the nectar from your life and give
[1:09:43] encouragement to their own life
[1:09:45] and and we can encourage one another
[1:09:47] because we finally moved to a place of
[1:09:49] maturity there's no other generation of
[1:09:52] time that could be in the position that
[1:09:54] we are except for you the people of the
[1:09:57] lord that's here this morning hour and
[1:09:59] by internet or wherever around the world
[1:10:01] because it's a time when the bride comes
[1:10:03] into a place
[1:10:05] of full let's say full
[1:10:07] full maturity amen we're no longer just
[1:10:10] a little girl i watch a little girls
[1:10:12] there's a wedding and you watch them
[1:10:14] afterwards they're they're still playing
[1:10:16] in the wedding and they're one day
[1:10:17] they're hoping to get into a place where
[1:10:19] where they will also be a bride but we
[1:10:22] can say we are the bride and we are
[1:10:24] prepared because we are now mature
[1:10:28] christians we're mature in the word of
[1:10:32] god and being immaturity in the word of
[1:10:35] god you know how to handle yourself now
[1:10:38] when you come into situations of life
[1:10:41] amen one thing they said about brother
[1:10:43] branham you couldn't tell his enemies
[1:10:45] from his friends i think that there can
[1:10:47] be said that about your life that nobody
[1:10:49] can tell your entities from your friends
[1:10:51] because you treat them all the same amen
[1:10:54] because it's in your heart that they
[1:10:56] also may have an opportunity to hear
[1:10:58] this grand gospel that you hear and to
[1:11:01] be able to come to the knowledge of the
[1:11:03] truth just like you did because in all
[1:11:05] honesty church if it had not been for
[1:11:07] the grace of almighty god many of us
[1:11:10] would not even be here today we'd be who
[1:11:12] knows where i would be here today i look
[1:11:15] at it all the time in ephesians chapter
[1:11:18] 2 by grace am i saved through faith amen
[1:11:21] it's a gift of god not of my own works
[1:11:24] but we we are all the workmanship of
[1:11:26] jesus christ amen because man inheritan
[1:11:30] himself would like to brag
[1:11:33] mannan himself has pride in his heart
[1:11:35] but when christ comes into our heart and
[1:11:37] we move into an area of maturity we no
[1:11:41] longer have to prove anything to the
[1:11:44] world we know who we are
[1:11:46] we are the bride of jesus christ we are
[1:11:48] the sons and daughters of god we are in
[1:11:51] a place of full maturity i kind of like
[1:11:54] that word because that word is abound
[1:11:58] and it means as we just indicated that
[1:12:00] we have come to a place of maturity
[1:12:04] another word i'd like to highlight is
[1:12:06] the word hope
[1:12:07] joyful and confident expectation of
[1:12:10] eternal salvation which is what hope
[1:12:13] means in the greek i say it one more
[1:12:16] time joyful and confident expectation of
[1:12:18] eternal salvation so we have a hope in
[1:12:21] our heart
[1:12:22] my hope i'm looking forward to going
[1:12:25] home
[1:12:26] but i'll be honest with you i'm looking
[1:12:27] forward to going home
[1:12:29] amen there's something about it where i
[1:12:31] don't have to worry about jet fuel won't
[1:12:33] have to worry about what the price of
[1:12:35] gasoline is going to be next week or the
[1:12:37] or the price of a two by four is going
[1:12:39] to be next week or gotta order a car
[1:12:41] maybe get it in three four years i don't
[1:12:43] have to worry about we don't want to
[1:12:45] worry about that no more we're going to
[1:12:47] a place where we don't need no gas we
[1:12:49] don't need no fuel we don't need no jet
[1:12:51] fuel we don't need no automobiles we're
[1:12:54] going to just travel like a thot amen so
[1:12:56] if you're all fellowshipping in the
[1:12:58] shenandoah valley on the other side i'm
[1:13:01] up in saskatchewan on the other side in
[1:13:03] a moment of time we'll be together again
[1:13:05] that's a hope we have in our heart
[1:13:08] that's eternal salvation not just
[1:13:10] something that's just temporary but
[1:13:13] something that is eternal because jesus
[1:13:16] came from eternity he went back to
[1:13:18] eternity and we were in him from the
[1:13:21] very beginning
[1:13:23] hallelujah
[1:13:24] i kind of like that
[1:13:27] i said this at home many times we got
[1:13:29] enough word right now we could close our
[1:13:31] bibles and go home
[1:13:32] my grandsons tell me you'd never let
[1:13:34] them out
[1:13:38] i said you're right
[1:13:43] another word which is which we've looked
[1:13:45] at and you know it very well there's the
[1:13:47] word power through the power of the holy
[1:13:48] ghost which is dunamis so each one of us
[1:13:51] must have the holy ghost
[1:13:53] you're not going to make it in the
[1:13:55] rapture without the holy ghost
[1:13:58] absolutely impossible
[1:14:00] you have to have the holy ghost it's not
[1:14:02] an option it's not one of those things
[1:14:04] where you when you buy a car you put an
[1:14:06] auction you have options you okay i want
[1:14:08] this option that option you're going to
[1:14:09] skip over the holy ghost loft no
[1:14:11] you must have the holy ghost in your
[1:14:13] life amen and we must have refillings in
[1:14:16] our life continually all the time amen
[1:14:19] when i drink water i'm happy to drink
[1:14:21] more water in in the next half an hour
[1:14:23] it's something that that you need for
[1:14:25] your physical body is something you need
[1:14:26] for your spiritual life is you need the
[1:14:28] holy ghost and you need to top it up all
[1:14:31] the time amen i don't like to run on the
[1:14:33] empty side i like to run on the full
[1:14:35] side amen because i want to make sure i
[1:14:37] have enough to make it through
[1:14:39] amen i hope that's okay today
[1:14:41] now this morning i'd like to
[1:14:43] my title if i would title it is keep
[1:14:46] pressing on
[1:14:48] keep pressing on if i would if i would
[1:14:50] want to use a subtitle to the thought
[1:14:53] this morning
[1:14:54] the subtitle would be there's better
[1:14:56] things ahead than any that you're going
[1:14:58] to leave behind
[1:15:03] there's better things ahead than
[1:15:05] anything that you're going to leave
[1:15:06] behind
[1:15:07] amen every day i'm leaving a lot of
[1:15:09] things behind i'm not going back to them
[1:15:11] but there's better things one of the
[1:15:13] better things is eternal life is a
[1:15:14] rapture amen i'm going toward the
[1:15:17] rapture amen last night we we took our
[1:15:20] texts and it was pull your sword for
[1:15:22] we're engaged in a battle and we're
[1:15:24] fighting a battle every day we i
[1:15:26] presented that statue to brother ron and
[1:15:28] that statue
[1:15:30] and i named it my enemy is dead
[1:15:32] amen because we believe that our enemies
[1:15:35] are dead it may be sickness it may be
[1:15:37] some besetting sin it might be something
[1:15:39] in our lives that that's holding us back
[1:15:42] but we're we want to declare to satan
[1:15:44] this morning that you're dead in my life
[1:15:47] and christ is alive in my life amen all
[1:15:50] of darkness is out of my heart all
[1:15:52] that's left in my heart now is light
[1:15:55] and that light is jesus christ amen now
[1:15:58] yesterday i was talking about i was
[1:16:00] saying that david's foot was on his
[1:16:02] mouth but it was actually his foot was
[1:16:03] on his eye and i want to make that
[1:16:04] correction this morning
[1:16:06] his foot was on his eye because goliath
[1:16:09] had a false light
[1:16:12] and goliath was was declaring by his
[1:16:15] idols and his god that his god was a
[1:16:18] greater god than what than what david's
[1:16:20] was but david declared that his god was
[1:16:23] the living god
[1:16:25] amen and when he died he put his foot
[1:16:28] right where it needed to be was right on
[1:16:30] his eyes so forgive me for that but i
[1:16:32] just missed the vision i just wanted to
[1:16:34] make sure i clarified this morning hour
[1:16:36] is his foot was on his eye amen and
[1:16:40] those eyes were a big old sausage like
[1:16:41] brother brown said they were and that's
[1:16:43] where it was the light was gone but
[1:16:46] david still had light in his eye amen
[1:16:49] there's one thing that is very very
[1:16:51] critical is that when you have light you
[1:16:54] have to you have no darkness and living
[1:16:56] in dark lady osea like we're living in
[1:16:59] we realize is the only light that's in
[1:17:01] the world is your life
[1:17:04] amen it's your life amen now when christ
[1:17:07] came into your heart as paul said in
[1:17:09] romans 7 21 he said when i would do good
[1:17:12] evil is present
[1:17:15] i'll tell you what the day you gave your
[1:17:17] heart to the lord is the day that that
[1:17:19] you started in a battle amen this battle
[1:17:21] that we're in is not for weak of heart
[1:17:23] people this battle that we're in is a
[1:17:26] battle that that you have to be prepared
[1:17:28] to fight every moment of every day
[1:17:31] because there's two spirits that's
[1:17:33] warring one spirit is good and one
[1:17:35] spirit is evil and good is trying to
[1:17:37] pull you to the scripture and evil is
[1:17:39] trying to pull you away from the
[1:17:41] scripture amen but i'm glad that the
[1:17:43] good is winning
[1:17:45] amen why is he winning because he won a
[1:17:47] calvary amen so the spirit of jesus
[1:17:50] christ in your life can never fail
[1:17:53] we may fail and we may fall short we may
[1:17:56] miss say certain words but god's word
[1:17:59] will never fail amen his word is eternal
[1:18:03] amen and just as his word is eternal we
[1:18:06] become eternal in his word i'm so
[1:18:08] thankful for the grace of god now we've
[1:18:11] heard in this in the message all of our
[1:18:12] life about the apache chief
[1:18:15] and that apache chief he he was filled
[1:18:17] with the holy ghost and and they came
[1:18:19] and talked to them and they said to him
[1:18:21] and they said how are you doing and he
[1:18:24] said well i'm doing pretty good and i'm
[1:18:26] doing pretty bad
[1:18:28] and they said
[1:18:30] he said since i received the holy ghost
[1:18:32] there's two dogs fighting in me
[1:18:34] we're all familiar with it but it bears
[1:18:36] repeating
[1:18:37] amen and he said that i've got a white
[1:18:40] one and a black one isn't amazing he
[1:18:42] definitely made a definition one was
[1:18:44] white and one was black
[1:18:45] amen and so they said they arguing all
[1:18:48] the time they growl and fight with one
[1:18:50] another and one wants me to do good and
[1:18:52] the other one wants me to do bad
[1:18:55] maybe you've never felt that way but i
[1:18:56] know in canada it kind of happens that
[1:18:58] way sometimes where where you you wanna
[1:19:01] you you wanna do this and it seems like
[1:19:03] something's there always to stop you
[1:19:05] amen well we learned that just the devil
[1:19:08] amen when we learn that we just look at
[1:19:10] it like the one man that brother brown
[1:19:13] talked about he woke up in the middle of
[1:19:14] the night and and he looked oh it's just
[1:19:17] the devil he went back to sleep see
[1:19:18] that's how we have to be about it it's
[1:19:21] just a devil you got no power over me
[1:19:24] amen because christ is within my heart i
[1:19:27] don't fear you anymore you're just a
[1:19:29] goliath to me and when the time comes
[1:19:32] i'm going to knock you
[1:19:34] down we have a witness this morning in
[1:19:37] the house
[1:19:38] amen he said well which one is when
[1:19:41] well we've heard it before and and it
[1:19:43] says well it depends on which one i'm
[1:19:45] feeding
[1:19:47] you know sometimes we feed it a lot with
[1:19:49] the things we shouldn't be feeding our
[1:19:51] souls with amen and i you know you say
[1:19:54] well you know he's going to go again on
[1:19:56] the internet and all the social media
[1:19:58] stuff yeah you know what bear's
[1:19:59] repeating because social media will not
[1:20:02] bring you to the rapture nor give you
[1:20:04] faith for the rapture
[1:20:05] it will not but i know that the word of
[1:20:07] god and listening to the message is
[1:20:09] going to give you what you have need of
[1:20:11] to make the rapture amen we have to
[1:20:14] remember what paul said lest i become a
[1:20:16] castaway amen we don't want to live our
[1:20:19] whole life and miss it at the last
[1:20:20] moment no we want to live our whole life
[1:20:22] and be going through it flying colors i
[1:20:25] i say i don't want the door hit me on
[1:20:27] the way in i want to make sure i'm all
[1:20:29] the way in all the time
[1:20:32] amen do you believe that this morning
[1:20:35] amen we we have to keep ourselves
[1:20:37] fortified we have to keep ourselves
[1:20:39] moving in a positive direction amen i
[1:20:42] say that let's fill our lives and fill
[1:20:44] our heart amen with praise and
[1:20:46] thanksgiving with the word of the lord
[1:20:49] and thank god continually day and night
[1:20:51] for what god has done amen the bible
[1:20:53] said lift up holy hands and praise and
[1:20:56] thanksgiving and prayer onto almighty
[1:20:59] god i believe that the lord loves the
[1:21:01] prayers of his people
[1:21:03] amen
[1:21:04] and the praises of his people no the
[1:21:06] greatest battle we have is within our
[1:21:07] mind in it and it's a daily battle
[1:21:11] we have good thoughts
[1:21:14] and then the next thing you know you got
[1:21:15] a negan of thought
[1:21:17] the next thing you know you've got a
[1:21:19] thought of fear
[1:21:21] amen the next thing you don't even know
[1:21:22] it comes also you've got a thought of
[1:21:24] peace over you
[1:21:26] amen the next thing you have thoughts of
[1:21:28] distress
[1:21:29] and you wonder where's all this coming
[1:21:31] from and then thoughts of anger i don't
[1:21:33] know if y'all have ever happened to you
[1:21:34] but i have to be honest and confess that
[1:21:36] sometimes can happen
[1:21:38] you got these thoughts of anger and then
[1:21:40] then also you have a thought of joy or a
[1:21:42] thought of doubt or a thought of faith
[1:21:44] amen and then we have thoughts which can
[1:21:46] impact relationship
[1:21:49] thoughts in our relationship that will
[1:21:51] make your marriage either positive or
[1:21:53] negative
[1:21:56] sometimes there's things that are just
[1:21:58] better left not said
[1:22:00] just don't say him
[1:22:02] amen sometimes there's things that are
[1:22:04] said and it's going to cause a big
[1:22:06] uproar
[1:22:07] i've been married 42 years i could kind
[1:22:09] of say a few things because i know where
[1:22:11] i've been at
[1:22:13] hey man there's sometimes you say oh i
[1:22:15] had somebody tell us back home one time
[1:22:16] i was doing some marriage and counseling
[1:22:18] and they looked at me said brother kelly
[1:22:20] you don't have a clue what we're doing
[1:22:22] what we're going through i said what are
[1:22:23] you talking about well you and sister
[1:22:25] meyer never had a fight in your life i
[1:22:26] started to laugh i said you're going to
[1:22:29] try to believe thank you actually
[1:22:30] believe that the man was older myself i
[1:22:32] said give your head a shake
[1:22:34] i said there what do you think for two
[1:22:36] people
[1:22:38] there's times that we do disagree if you
[1:22:40] want to just be honest with it amen and
[1:22:43] i know it's the same way with all of us
[1:22:44] if you're honest with yourself that's
[1:22:45] just how it is amen but there's
[1:22:47] something that keeps you together amen
[1:22:50] what keeps you together is the word of
[1:22:52] almighty god amen it's a love for one
[1:22:54] another amen what keeps your servant god
[1:22:57] it's a love for the word of god amen it
[1:23:00] keeps you in the hand of almighty god
[1:23:03] amen i want to keep myself in his palm
[1:23:05] at all time i never want him to take me
[1:23:08] out of his hands
[1:23:12] we have thoughts that would try to pull
[1:23:14] us from the orality of the word of god
[1:23:17] that's why people
[1:23:18] criticize i say literally there's got to
[1:23:21] be critics you can't get to the hall of
[1:23:22] fame without a critic
[1:23:24] amen let them criticize
[1:23:26] amen sometimes it doesn't feel good it's
[1:23:29] kind of sometimes the same people and no
[1:23:30] doubt maybe i'll get emails and things
[1:23:32] as well once they know what my email
[1:23:34] address is just don't give it up and
[1:23:36] they'll start sending me emails and
[1:23:38] texts and whatever but reality when you
[1:23:40] have something in your heart that is so
[1:23:43] important and so special amen which is
[1:23:45] christ crucified alive living in my
[1:23:48] heart amen and on the throne room i i i
[1:23:52] say it one more time you have something
[1:23:54] to be grateful about something to thank
[1:23:56] the lord about amen and i say i'm going
[1:23:58] to think on that thought amen and let
[1:24:00] the critics say what they may
[1:24:02] amen they can be ice cubes if they want
[1:24:04] to be they can be dead as a nail if they
[1:24:07] want to be they can be dried old wall
[1:24:09] flowers if they want to be it really
[1:24:11] don't make no difference to me amen but
[1:24:13] i'm going to a place where there's going
[1:24:15] to be a lot of noise there's going to be
[1:24:17] a lot of people i'm going to have a
[1:24:19] change in my body and i'm going to be
[1:24:21] honest i'm going to rejoice and i'm
[1:24:23] going to sing i'm going to shout i'm not
[1:24:26] going to get hoarse i'm not going to get
[1:24:28] tired i'm going to wring out the glories
[1:24:30] of god because we've got something to
[1:24:33] thank him for
[1:24:35] something to glorify his name for
[1:24:37] something to praise him about amen it's
[1:24:40] almighty god and what he's done for us
[1:24:43] hallelujah he's saved us he's healed us
[1:24:46] he's kept us in his hand he's keeping us
[1:24:49] to this day he'll keep us all the way
[1:24:52] through eternity
[1:24:54] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:24:56] lord
[1:24:58] amen now satan doesn't attack you
[1:25:00] because you're weak
[1:25:02] he attacks you because you're strong
[1:25:04] let's say i'm strong
[1:25:06] i'm strong in the lord satan knows if he
[1:25:09] can get you to pull away from the word
[1:25:12] he's got you left amen so he's doing his
[1:25:14] best to distract you but we're not going
[1:25:17] to get distracted
[1:25:18] we're going to keep ourselves moving in
[1:25:20] the things of god
[1:25:22] keep moving higher and higher
[1:25:25] now i'm just going to preach like i
[1:25:26] preach at home if that's all right
[1:25:28] and the message perseverance he said now
[1:25:30] the devil is not like some people think
[1:25:32] he's mean and everything but he's
[1:25:34] deceitful
[1:25:36] the devil makes you think that you're
[1:25:38] right but when you disagree with the
[1:25:39] word that shows that isn't the spirit of
[1:25:43] god
[1:25:44] because the holy spirit wrote the bible
[1:25:46] and then it's got to be agreed agreeable
[1:25:50] with the word
[1:25:52] amen so it's good instruction to us if
[1:25:54] there's something in our heart that's
[1:25:56] disagreeing with the word then we must
[1:25:59] check ourselves to be sure we're in the
[1:26:02] word i'll just go a step further if you
[1:26:04] have the holy ghost in your heart you
[1:26:05] will check yourself with the word to be
[1:26:08] sure you're in the word and when you
[1:26:10] realize you're not in the word you're
[1:26:11] going to do something about it because
[1:26:14] you don't want to be wrong in the word
[1:26:17] because the word is where you have your
[1:26:19] protection that's why when people
[1:26:21] retract from the word and retract from
[1:26:24] from the message they go downhill very
[1:26:27] quickly because they have no longer any
[1:26:29] dis defense there's no boundaries
[1:26:32] amen the word gives us boundaries those
[1:26:35] boundaries aren't to do's and don'ts
[1:26:37] those boundaries our love boundaries
[1:26:39] those boundaries are put in place amen
[1:26:42] in order that we can go to a destination
[1:26:44] which is eternal life amen god set
[1:26:47] boundaries he said boundaries in israel
[1:26:50] he gives boundaries for us as believers
[1:26:52] i say thank you lord
[1:26:55] somebody told me one time i was i was in
[1:26:57] legalism i said seriously
[1:26:59] he said well you don't want to do this
[1:27:01] and you don't can't do that i say why in
[1:27:03] the world want to do that for
[1:27:05] there's nothing in my heart to do it
[1:27:08] and then they say well you're you're
[1:27:09] living you're living in a terrible place
[1:27:11] i said no i'm actually living in the
[1:27:13] best place
[1:27:14] because i know that when i'm in the word
[1:27:16] of god that it types abraham and israel
[1:27:19] when they were in the promised land when
[1:27:21] they were in the promised land god
[1:27:22] blessed him when you're in the promised
[1:27:24] word god blesses you
[1:27:27] amen i just accept his blessing i walk
[1:27:29] on it in the name of the lord
[1:27:33] we brought out yesterday we're in the
[1:27:34] second second corinthians chapter 10
[1:27:37] verse 5 be it says bring every every
[1:27:39] thought into captivity to the obedience
[1:27:42] of god bring it to captivity every
[1:27:44] thought we looked at just one part in
[1:27:46] the passion translation that says we
[1:27:49] capture like prisoners of war every
[1:27:52] thought and insist that a bow in
[1:27:54] obedience to the anointed one in other
[1:27:56] words there's something we do we allow
[1:27:58] god to work in our lives
[1:28:03] in our life's journey we can lose sight
[1:28:05] that everything we have need of us in
[1:28:06] christ
[1:28:09] but as kings and priests chosen of god
[1:28:11] we must keep the holy ghost and fire
[1:28:13] kindled
[1:28:16] in the old testament there was one duty
[1:28:18] that the levites had to do and were
[1:28:20] kings and priests
[1:28:22] the levites were given an order
[1:28:24] and that order was that the fire of god
[1:28:26] would come down and consume the fast
[1:28:28] sacrifice it wasn't a man's fire well i
[1:28:30] don't want no man's fire
[1:28:32] i want the holy ghost to fire
[1:28:35] amen man's fire is a fire that is not a
[1:28:37] good fire we of course there's all types
[1:28:39] of that in the scripture
[1:28:40] but in the scripture it says when the
[1:28:42] when the lord came sent the fire down
[1:28:44] consumed the sacrifice there was
[1:28:46] something that the levites had to do and
[1:28:49] they were instructed to do every morning
[1:28:51] and every night it was their duty to be
[1:28:53] sure
[1:28:54] that fire would never go out
[1:28:57] amen i say in our lives it's our duty as
[1:29:00] believers it's pastoral for a moment
[1:29:03] here it's our duty as believers to never
[1:29:06] let let's say neverland
[1:29:08] never let the fire of god go out in your
[1:29:11] life
[1:29:13] amen that's why people can't rejoice
[1:29:15] because they have allowed the fire to go
[1:29:17] out they have a mental conception of the
[1:29:21] message but they have no life to back it
[1:29:24] up within their life amen why because
[1:29:27] the fire has gone out i say lord let the
[1:29:30] fire fall in this church this morning
[1:29:33] hour and consume everything that's in
[1:29:35] this church for the glory of almighty
[1:29:38] god let the fire of god fall upon every
[1:29:42] heart
[1:29:43] every individual we need the fire of god
[1:29:46] amen and how do we stoke the fire by the
[1:29:49] word of god we stoke the fire it
[1:29:52] continually starts to grow it does not
[1:29:55] diminish church it grows and grows and
[1:29:58] grows and consumes everything
[1:30:00] that's not of god
[1:30:02] it becomes a sweet smelling savor to
[1:30:05] almighty god
[1:30:07] now there's times we don't feel like
[1:30:08] praising the lord
[1:30:10] there's times i don't feel like
[1:30:11] preaching
[1:30:13] but i preach anyhow
[1:30:16] i hope that's okay i said that
[1:30:19] there's sometimes you don't feel like it
[1:30:21] sometimes you're a wish to the guy
[1:30:22] that's fishing the sunday morning when
[1:30:24] he maybe should have been in church
[1:30:26] i i think you maybe don't have any lakes
[1:30:28] close to all
[1:30:30] we have a lot of lakes
[1:30:34] but we preach anyhow
[1:30:37] we praise them anyhow
[1:30:40] why because we want to make sure the
[1:30:41] fire does not go out
[1:30:43] we got a kindle every morning every noon
[1:30:46] every every evening
[1:30:50] god knows your heart's desire
[1:30:52] he knows your burdens
[1:30:55] he knows your fears
[1:30:57] he knows your health conditions
[1:31:00] you say well pretty healthy you might
[1:31:02] get a doctor report in a week or two
[1:31:05] might be shocking news
[1:31:08] amen because god knows our health
[1:31:10] condition
[1:31:12] amen you might have a financial burden
[1:31:14] but god understands your situation
[1:31:17] i had somebody tell me one time he said
[1:31:19] you know what it's like to be without i
[1:31:20] said seriously
[1:31:22] i said i know what it's like to be
[1:31:23] without i know what it's like to not
[1:31:25] know when i'm gonna get my next dollar
[1:31:27] to pay my bills
[1:31:29] amen
[1:31:30] yeah the lord lets us go through a lot
[1:31:32] of things as people
[1:31:34] amen but it's only there for one reason
[1:31:36] just to drive us sometimes closer to god
[1:31:38] and to trust him more
[1:31:39] amen but god knows all of our needs
[1:31:42] let's say he knows my needs he knows
[1:31:44] them all and the bible says he'll
[1:31:46] deliver us out of them all amen he has
[1:31:48] an ability to do that you say well maybe
[1:31:51] i don't have a right job but he'll get
[1:31:53] the right job for you
[1:31:55] amen but you have to be faithful in that
[1:31:57] job
[1:31:58] and one place i'm going to just say this
[1:32:00] this morning i'm i'm i'm leaving leaving
[1:32:03] in a few moments here maybe an hour or
[1:32:05] two but there's something we have to be
[1:32:07] as faithful in tithes and offerings
[1:32:10] amen we don't realize the significance
[1:32:12] of it if we don't pay our tithes we're
[1:32:15] just nothing but a robber you say well i
[1:32:17] i'm a good christian you're not a good
[1:32:19] christian if you don't pay tithes and
[1:32:21] offerings

[1:32:24] for the word of god the bible said he
[1:32:26] would he would rebuke the devourer but

[1:32:35] morning you cannot afford it
[1:32:38] you have to pay it amen you if you don't
[1:32:41] pay it god will not rebuke the devourer
[1:32:46] i've seen people that have paid their
[1:32:48] tithes and offerings faithfully and
[1:32:49] sometimes people say well i paid them
[1:32:51] faithful for six months well it's like
[1:32:54] people they they want to make a prayer
[1:32:56] they go to a pot machine pop into the
[1:32:57] corner i guess whatever you guys pop in
[1:33:00] we popping loonies and toonies but you
[1:33:01] pop in dollar bills and
[1:33:03] and you get to pop in the bottom people
[1:33:05] expect prayer to be like that i prayed
[1:33:07] in the morning i expect something by the
[1:33:09] afternoon that's just not how it works
[1:33:12] amen sometimes you've got to wait a long
[1:33:14] time
[1:33:15] amen i i have asthma i still suffer a
[1:33:17] bit with respiratory illness but i
[1:33:19] waited 18 years for god to deliver me
[1:33:22] amen but i want to say he was right on
[1:33:24] time amen now when i look back at it i'm
[1:33:26] 60 years old and i look back at it at 39
[1:33:29] years old god gave deliverance in my
[1:33:32] life and i can say this morning he is a
[1:33:34] healer because i've experienced it
[1:33:37] firsthand in my life and i can say this
[1:33:39] morning he is faithful to his word
[1:33:44] but you have to be faithful
[1:33:45] [Music]
[1:33:48] you have to be faithful
[1:33:51] amen the message love in 56 he said to
[1:33:54] think that perfect love casts out all
[1:33:56] fear
[1:33:56] you're not scared about nothing
[1:34:01] you're risk resting
[1:34:03] you're not oh i might backslide tomorrow
[1:34:05] i may backslide next week i wouldn't
[1:34:07] worry about that
[1:34:08] i'm not trying to hold on he held on for
[1:34:10] me
[1:34:11] and he put a love in my heart that holds
[1:34:13] there it's him holding me not not me
[1:34:16] holding him amen i'm glad i'm in his
[1:34:18] hand
[1:34:19] amen if it was me holding him i'd
[1:34:21] probably turn loose this brother branham
[1:34:24] but as long as he's holding me he will
[1:34:26] never turn loose let's say never this
[1:34:28] morning he will never turn loose let's
[1:34:30] say one more time never he will never
[1:34:33] turn loose he promised he wouldn't i'll
[1:34:35] never leave thee nor forsake thee he
[1:34:38] says amen and i say amen this morning
[1:34:41] because he's never going to lose one of
[1:34:43] his own they're in the palm of his hand
[1:34:46] i say church hold on
[1:34:49] be faithful
[1:34:51] he is faithful
[1:34:53] the least we can do is be faithful in
[1:34:54] the small things
[1:35:00] beyond the curtain of time brother brown
[1:35:02] was laying on his bed
[1:35:05] had his hands behind his head
[1:35:09] and he said
[1:35:10] i seem to hear the music and the words
[1:35:12] of an old familiar song
[1:35:17] he said i'm the homesick and blue
[1:35:19] i want to see jesus
[1:35:22] you say where the kelly what does this
[1:35:23] have to do is because whatever you're
[1:35:24] leaving behind there's something better
[1:35:25] ahead
[1:35:27] this is what's the better part
[1:35:30] he said i'd like to hear those harbor
[1:35:32] bells chime
[1:35:34] it would brighten my path and banish all
[1:35:36] fears
[1:35:37] lord look me pal let me look past the
[1:35:39] curtain of time
[1:35:41] amen
[1:35:43] i've mentioned yesterday i've got loved
[1:35:44] ones over there i can hardly wait to see
[1:35:46] them
[1:35:47] hey i know you have loved ones over
[1:35:49] there you can hardly wait to see them
[1:35:51] amen but one day church they're going to
[1:35:53] be knocking on your door
[1:35:55] hey man i look with anticipation for
[1:35:58] that day
[1:35:59] i i could be by tomorrow morning i don't
[1:36:01] know when it will be but it's going to
[1:36:02] be sometime soon
[1:36:04] amen the boy said would you like to look
[1:36:06] behind the curtain of time
[1:36:08] hey man he said that would help me so
[1:36:10] much
[1:36:11] amen because you have to remember here's
[1:36:12] a here's a prophet he said that he
[1:36:14] thought maybe brother neville would be
[1:36:15] on one cloud and he'd be on another
[1:36:17] cloud and he wouldn't be able to shake
[1:36:19] his hand and and and he would watch and
[1:36:21] say hey brother neville how are you
[1:36:23] doing he just flowed by he flew over
[1:36:24] here he didn't understand it but the
[1:36:27] lord showed himself i'm so glad he
[1:36:29] showed it to him amen because it
[1:36:31] strengthens my heart every day when i
[1:36:33] think about it amen there's such a grand
[1:36:36] homecoming time that's before the church
[1:36:37] of the living god i say this morning
[1:36:40] church don't miss it
[1:36:42] amen whatever you do don't miss it
[1:36:45] amen it's right before the church amen
[1:36:48] what did brother brown experience
[1:36:50] well you've heard it many times but i'm
[1:36:52] going to remind you again
[1:36:54] he experienced young men in the
[1:36:55] brilliance of their of their young
[1:36:57] manhood
[1:36:59] amen
[1:37:00] young woman with their hair hanging down
[1:37:02] to their waist with their eyes
[1:37:03] glistening like a star on a dark and
[1:37:05] night night he said their teeth were as
[1:37:08] white as pearls
[1:37:10] no matter it's no wonder that you go
[1:37:12] into a into a confession or into a drug
[1:37:14] store and you see all this toothpaste to
[1:37:16] make your teeth whiter buy this one and
[1:37:18] make your teeth whiter people put caps
[1:37:20] on it because they know in their heart
[1:37:22] there's a land that is better than this
[1:37:24] land amen but we are going to be the
[1:37:27] inheritor of that particular land amen
[1:37:30] god has put it in your heart and let you
[1:37:33] know that i'm part of the rapture i'm
[1:37:36] bride material i'm going to be in that
[1:37:39] land and there's going to be a day we're
[1:37:41] going to experience it when your eyes
[1:37:43] are going to glisten
[1:37:45] your teeth are going to be white as
[1:37:47] pearl
[1:37:48] hallelujah
[1:37:50] the voice just said to him he said
[1:37:52] you've just started but keep pressing
[1:37:54] the battle
[1:37:55] if you only
[1:37:56] knew what was at the end of the road
[1:37:59] that's where i got my inspiration from
[1:38:01] for this little thought here
[1:38:03] there's better things ahead
[1:38:05] than things that you're left behind
[1:38:08] there's better things ahead that's why
[1:38:10] we struggle
[1:38:11] that's why we press
[1:38:13] because we're pressing to a glorious
[1:38:15] place where there's no there's no death
[1:38:17] no sorrow where there's no evil where
[1:38:19] there's no suffering there's no
[1:38:21] struggling anymore it's just peace and
[1:38:23] joy
[1:38:24] amen can you imagine a place where
[1:38:27] there's only going to be peace and joy
[1:38:29] and happiness and exuberance and and
[1:38:32] just a love we're going to be out of
[1:38:34] this world of envy and jealousy and and
[1:38:37] malice and hatred and the more they talk
[1:38:40] about loving one another in this world
[1:38:43] the more they hate one another the more
[1:38:45] they try to put everything together the
[1:38:47] more it falls apart amen why because
[1:38:49] this is no continuing city you can build
[1:38:52] a new house today in 15 years you're
[1:38:54] putting a new roof on your house amen
[1:38:57] five years later you're putting new
[1:38:58] windows in your house why because
[1:39:00] nothing's continuing but when we get to
[1:39:02] the other side church amen it's going to
[1:39:04] be a glorious time you're going to plant
[1:39:07] something and you're going to be able to
[1:39:09] live off of what you planned you're
[1:39:11] going to build something and you're
[1:39:12] going to be able to inhabit it amen what
[1:39:15] a glorious land it's going to be church
[1:39:17] amen i say this morning one more time
[1:39:20] don't miss it whatever you do get
[1:39:22] perfect love in your heart amen we've
[1:39:24] got to get ready for this time for this
[1:39:27] land that god has promised to the church
[1:39:30] of the living god don't miss it
[1:39:34] if you've got something in your heart
[1:39:35] toward one another i say this morning in
[1:39:38] the name of the lord jesus christ get it
[1:39:40] out of your heart you cannot afford to
[1:39:43] miss a rapture because some heart
[1:39:45] feeling in your heart amen get it out of
[1:39:48] your heart
[1:39:50] the problem with people is they always
[1:39:51] want to point fingers at the next person
[1:39:53] when they should be looking at their own
[1:39:55] enemy which is themselves and deal with
[1:39:57] themselves
[1:40:02] people want to have envy and malice and
[1:40:04] pride
[1:40:05] hey man you can't want to talk to them
[1:40:07] they won't even talk to you claim to
[1:40:09] believe this message i say they're
[1:40:10] backslidden
[1:40:12] amen lacking the holy ghost in their
[1:40:14] life
[1:40:15] amen we need the holy ghost in our life
[1:40:17] to a full measure the holy ghost in your
[1:40:19] life will bring you to the word of god
[1:40:22] amen i believe that with all my heart
[1:40:24] brother branham taught that in the
[1:40:26] message amen the holy ghost brings us to
[1:40:28] the word of almighty god not away from
[1:40:31] the word of god
[1:40:34] amen
[1:40:35] hallelujah
[1:40:40] we need to get that in our hearts
[1:40:44] that's why the bible say pray for those
[1:40:46] that despitefully use you
[1:40:49] persecute you
[1:40:51] invisible union brother brown told us
[1:40:53] that
[1:40:54] we're going to a wedding in the sky
[1:40:57] and he said that that we already have
[1:40:58] we're already wearing
[1:41:00] the wedding band of predestinated
[1:41:02] unmerited favor
[1:41:04] he has already slipped it on your hands
[1:41:07] amen he said he put your name on a book
[1:41:08] he said what a thanksgiving hallelujah
[1:41:11] praise our god
[1:41:12] hey man can you imagine he just went
[1:41:14] like this with you and just put it right
[1:41:16] on your finger undeserving
[1:41:18] but he said i chose you to be part of my
[1:41:20] bride
[1:41:21] hey man i chose you with all your
[1:41:23] complexes with all your situation i
[1:41:25] chose you to be part of my bride amen
[1:41:27] all we can do is embrace him with all of
[1:41:29] our heart amen because god who's
[1:41:32] omnipotent omniscient on the present
[1:41:34] he's perfect in power and wisdom but
[1:41:37] he's eternal he knows the end from the
[1:41:39] beginning amen if he knew the end from
[1:41:41] the beginning
[1:41:42] that he knew us before the foundation of
[1:41:44] the world put your name in the lamb's
[1:41:46] book of life
[1:41:48] watch over your seed amen your parents
[1:41:51] and grandparents and all the way back
[1:41:52] until you're here in this hour because
[1:41:55] your birth is more supernatural than the
[1:41:57] literal birth of jesus christ amen
[1:42:00] because he did that all in one act but
[1:42:02] this comes through all of time and he
[1:42:04] put everything together in your life for
[1:42:07] this special moment here on the earth
[1:42:10] amen that made you a son and daughter of
[1:42:12] god somebody say praise the lord in this
[1:42:14] house amen for what jesus christ has
[1:42:17] done for you
[1:42:20] he's watched over you he said i've heard
[1:42:22] that a lot of times but has it ever sunk
[1:42:24] in your heart
[1:42:26] the bible says we're fearfully and
[1:42:27] wonderfully made
[1:42:29] we're the handwork we're the workmanship
[1:42:31] of jesus christ he put the exact right
[1:42:34] thing in your life
[1:42:35] for a certain purpose and for a certain
[1:42:37] reason
[1:42:38] i don't about you but that makes me get
[1:42:40] excited when i think about that about
[1:42:42] what god is doing and what he's done hey
[1:42:44] man it makes me thrills my heart you say
[1:42:46] this is very simple brother kelly that's
[1:42:48] okay if it's simple but is it in your
[1:42:50] heart amen that you believe with all
[1:42:52] your heart amen in your heart perfect
[1:42:55] love amen and let all the rest of it go
[1:42:57] aside amen because it really doesn't
[1:42:59] matter anyhow all that's going to be
[1:43:01] left is your character because brother
[1:43:03] brahm said we only take our character
[1:43:05] with us
[1:43:07] and that character is going to be tried
[1:43:09] in the fiery flame of affliction amen
[1:43:11] and each one of us are not exempt from
[1:43:13] it we we're all going to go through it
[1:43:17] but we're going to come through it with
[1:43:18] flying colors
[1:43:21] amen because there's a promise i'm not
[1:43:23] going to leave you nor forsake you i'm
[1:43:25] watching over you because you're etching
[1:43:27] the palm of my hand amen your name is in
[1:43:30] the lamb's book of life
[1:43:34] hallelujah he's predestinated us
[1:43:36] he decreed it from eternity
[1:43:39] god never stood and said i'll choose you
[1:43:41] not choose you but by foreknowledge he
[1:43:43] knew what what you would do with his
[1:43:45] word
[1:43:48] amen there's a deep calling to the deep
[1:43:50] amen it's god that started it and
[1:43:52] there's god that's going to conclude it
[1:43:54] amen
[1:43:55] in god's power to transform he said but
[1:43:57] brother there's one thing i can brag on
[1:44:00] i can brag on my lord jesus christ who
[1:44:02] has redeemed me and with his
[1:44:03] transforming power planted a seed by
[1:44:07] predestination and i saw it
[1:44:11] amen we saw it
[1:44:16] do you know that when a baby is learning
[1:44:18] to walk i don't know if i ever said this
[1:44:20] here before or not maybe i have i don't
[1:44:22] remember
[1:44:24] when a baby is going to get ready to
[1:44:25] walk
[1:44:27] there's something in him that tells him
[1:44:28] to walk
[1:44:30] we had one baby that had some situations
[1:44:33] and and you prayed for him and that baby
[1:44:35] walked brother williams baby
[1:44:39] he gave me the testimony on an
[1:44:40] incredible testimony what god did for
[1:44:42] that child and and for brother tim's
[1:44:44] grandson and so many things that god has
[1:44:47] done
[1:44:49] but it's inherent in the seed
[1:44:51] in a child when it's born
[1:44:54] that that child is going to walk you
[1:44:55] know i don't know who stood with a
[1:44:56] stopwatch or with a clicker
[1:45:00] but they say a child
[1:45:01] tries to walk 2 000 times
[1:45:06] up and down up and down
[1:45:09] we as parents say you can do it
[1:45:12] you can do it
[1:45:14] you're going to walk amen we watch that
[1:45:17] child stumble and fall sometimes what we
[1:45:19] are with our walk of the lord we stumble
[1:45:20] and fall but i'm going to tell you this
[1:45:21] morning you can do it
[1:45:23] because your bride material
[1:45:25] amen and that child will will drop and
[1:45:28] fall and crawl up on this thing they
[1:45:30] said i watched that video clip that
[1:45:31] brother william made and they had him
[1:45:33] crawling over the over the uh the uh
[1:45:36] coffee table and over the couch and and
[1:45:39] he was calling there he was just walking
[1:45:41] around i could see his smile on his face
[1:45:42] he was so happy about it amen you say
[1:45:45] well he wasn't walking yet but he
[1:45:46] potentially was in him to walk amen but
[1:45:50] there was going to come a time when he
[1:45:51] would walk not only walk but he'd run
[1:45:54] amen and that don't take very long once
[1:45:56] they get their feet under me well amen
[1:45:58] that's how we are we are bound we come
[1:46:00] to full maturity amen we're no longer
[1:46:02] just babes in christ but we can take the
[1:46:04] strong meat of the gospel amen put it in
[1:46:07] our heart ingest it and be able to
[1:46:09] reflect jesus christ in the power of his
[1:46:12] resurrection amen why because we come
[1:46:15] through the little stages to come to
[1:46:17] this other stage because there's a gene
[1:46:19] in you but if you have the gene of jesus
[1:46:22] christ in you you can't help what you
[1:46:24] are you can't go back to the world amen
[1:46:27] because something in you is driving you
[1:46:30] i would say until this morning you are
[1:46:32] driven in this hour to complete what's
[1:46:34] in your heart
[1:46:37] something is calling for you
[1:46:39] for eternity
[1:46:40] amen they say that edison he made a
[1:46:43] thousand unsuccessful attempts at
[1:46:45] inventing a light paul
[1:46:46] i'm glad we got lights
[1:46:49] i'm glad i don't live in luther's day
[1:46:50] where they had candles
[1:46:53] can you imagine all the candles that
[1:46:54] have to light every day and clean all
[1:46:56] the globes and things like that why we'd
[1:46:58] be busy
[1:46:59] i think that would be a brother job
[1:47:01] instead of a sister job so i'm glad they
[1:47:02] made lights
[1:47:04] wait we can make sure we can turn them
[1:47:06] on just flip the switch
[1:47:08] and and and they they and they said a
[1:47:10] reporter asked him how did it feel to
[1:47:12] fail a thousand times and edison replied
[1:47:14] i didn't fail a thousand times
[1:47:16] he said the light bulb was the invention
[1:47:18] of a thousand steps
[1:47:19] amen because it just depends on how
[1:47:21] you're going to look at it amen if you
[1:47:23] look at it in the lenses of what he was
[1:47:25] looking at it he didn't look at one of
[1:47:28] his things as a failure it was just one
[1:47:30] more move towards the right place amen
[1:47:33] on one day he got to the right place
[1:47:35] amen and we got there he flicked a light
[1:47:37] switch on i can just imagine he probably
[1:47:40] sat up all night long watching that
[1:47:42] light burn away
[1:47:45] haven what do we have today we have
[1:47:47] lights
[1:47:48] amen we don't even think about it we
[1:47:49] just flip a switch but somebody had to
[1:47:51] invent that light amen it took certain
[1:47:53] amount of steps now god had seven church
[1:47:56] ages
[1:47:57] amen he built his bride all the way up
[1:48:00] she fell down in the dark ages but i
[1:48:02] want to say that the bride of christ
[1:48:04] came up powerful through luther's age
[1:48:06] and powerful through wesley's age and
[1:48:08] powerful through this age until now we
[1:48:11] have a pride of jesus christ on the seat
[1:48:13] amen with power behind her and ability
[1:48:16] behind her she's the bride of jesus
[1:48:19] christ ready to rule and reign
[1:48:23] not just some little girl playing
[1:48:25] playing wedding or something like that
[1:48:27] we are now the sons of god we are now
[1:48:29] the bride of jesus christ we're getting
[1:48:32] ready to rule and reign for eternity
[1:48:35] hallelujah
[1:48:37] you may say i don't know if that's me
[1:48:39] brother kelly i want to say that it is
[1:48:40] you
[1:48:43] the pacific salmon
[1:48:45] one of the fishes we have on the on the
[1:48:47] pacific coast
[1:48:49] we'll probably eat in the restaurants
[1:48:50] and things like that salmons but they're
[1:48:52] pouring in rivers and streams
[1:48:54] up in the hills and mountains along the
[1:48:55] west coast of canada
[1:48:58] and from birth it moves out into the
[1:49:00] ocean
[1:49:01] and it goes out into the ocean and swims
[1:49:03] in schools of other salmon and
[1:49:05] for much of its adult life but after
[1:49:07] about eight years
[1:49:09] which is about the lifespan of the
[1:49:11] salmon
[1:49:13] it travels thousands of miles they say
[1:49:15] in the ocean i guess they put trackers
[1:49:17] on it so they understand that and it
[1:49:19] begins to fulfill
[1:49:21] feel a strong urge within itself that it
[1:49:24] has to go back to that stream
[1:49:26] where it actually had to go home amen
[1:49:29] back to its home amen and to a place
[1:49:31] where it would go and lay its eggs for
[1:49:34] the next generation
[1:49:36] and they say that journey it's a long
[1:49:38] journey back home but it's in it to get
[1:49:41] to the exact same spot where it was born
[1:49:43] at
[1:49:44] amen we were in the mind of god we're
[1:49:46] going back to the exact same spot that
[1:49:49] we should have been before the
[1:49:50] foundational world amen when the sons of
[1:49:53] god shouted for joy and i want to
[1:49:55] emphasize that they shouted for joy amen
[1:49:58] they weren't sitting back and with their
[1:50:00] arms crossed and criticizing they were
[1:50:02] shouting with joy
[1:50:05] for the glory of the lord
[1:50:07] amen for god fills the whole house and
[1:50:10] when god is in the room there's power in
[1:50:12] the room there's healing in the room
[1:50:15] there's deliverance in the room when god
[1:50:17] shows up
[1:50:19] because he's supernatural
[1:50:22] amen when he's around something's good
[1:50:24] is gonna happen
[1:50:26] hey man i say this morning something
[1:50:27] good is gonna happen
[1:50:29] something good is happening this morning
[1:50:33] amen it begins this long journey back
[1:50:35] home from the salt water back into the
[1:50:36] fresh water
[1:50:38] and it passes hundreds and thousands of
[1:50:40] inlets and streams
[1:50:42] in order to get there but the scientists
[1:50:44] they say
[1:50:45] that the fish has been endowed with a
[1:50:48] powerful sense of smell
[1:50:51] and enable it to detect the scent of
[1:50:53] water
[1:50:54] it was born and to distinguish it from
[1:50:56] all others
[1:50:58] i thought about that thought and i
[1:50:59] thought
[1:51:00] lord with all of the
[1:51:02] all of the the noise that's around us
[1:51:04] and all of the diversions that around us
[1:51:06] and all the the manipulating doctrines
[1:51:09] all around us there's something in the
[1:51:11] heart of the children of god that will
[1:51:13] not be caught in that and if they are in
[1:51:15] that they'll get deliverance from that
[1:51:17] that's why i'm not going into any more
[1:51:19] man's boxes anymore i've been delivered
[1:51:21] from that amen i'm free
[1:51:24] amen and there's something in it that
[1:51:26] that has the ability to detect the right
[1:51:30] place at the right time
[1:51:32] amen they say that one drop let's say
[1:51:35] one drop
[1:51:36] one drop of fresh water and eight
[1:51:38] million liters of salt water is all that
[1:51:41] fish needs to get it's bearing its gps
[1:51:44] set for the correct path to the journey
[1:51:47] home
[1:51:48] one drop of water and eight million
[1:51:51] liters of water i thought about that it
[1:51:53] kind of made my heart jump for joy amen
[1:51:56] because when something came upon the
[1:51:58] seed gene was in my heart it recognized
[1:52:01] immediately i am a son of god amen
[1:52:04] nothing can take that away from the
[1:52:05] bride we are already the sons of god
[1:52:08] amen i didn't know it when i was when i
[1:52:11] was lost and undone hey i grew up in
[1:52:13] church but i had to come to the
[1:52:15] knowledge of jesus christ
[1:52:17] amen when i came to that knowledge what
[1:52:19] joy it said in my heart
[1:52:21] amen i set my feet to jump and to set my
[1:52:24] feet to dance and amen why it was a joy
[1:52:27] of almighty god
[1:52:29] one glimpse of the glory of god is all
[1:52:32] it takes
[1:52:33] it drops upon your heart
[1:52:35] they say upon detecting that scent
[1:52:38] the fish is relentless to get back to
[1:52:40] the place that was born
[1:52:42] it'll swim uphill it'll go aggressive
[1:52:44] flow of water it'll go over obstacles
[1:52:46] and rocks and waterfall and predators it
[1:52:49] finally arrives
[1:52:50] the fish is beaten and battered and
[1:52:53] bruised but it will lay its eggs and die
[1:52:56] and thus continuing the cycle of life
[1:52:59] amen god has that inherit in that amen
[1:53:02] we may be battling bruised and we may
[1:53:05] may have scars in our life from
[1:53:06] situations amen but we're going to make
[1:53:09] it
[1:53:10] amen we're going to make it amen there's
[1:53:12] nothing can stop you from not making it
[1:53:14] hey man it don't matter what obstacle's
