amen just thank you for everything that's done it and amen good to be in the house Lord in a man is good good to be here a man kind of missed brother Josh tonight you know brother John you're you're about a foot shorter than that guy so hey man so amen god bless you each and every one of you sure love you I'd like to speak to you tonight on the spark of expectation a man Romans chapter 8 and verse 17 and if children then heirs heirs of God that's quite a statement we could just stop right there and shout the rest of this evening and join heirs with Christ and if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willing buyer reason of him who had subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope but if we hope for that which we see it not then do we with patience wait for likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know that what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for his Saints according to the will of God our favorite scriptures and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified I'd say we have a rigged jury tonight what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us let's say that together tonight what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen may be of a need tonight you just like to raise your hand before the Lord let's just pray Almighty God we love you with all of our hearts we're thankful that we can come back to your house once again and Lord know that you're in control of every situation of every life so many are this time of year begin to have the little bugs and things that are going on in their lives we asked you to go to every home in every place and every sick boy girl mom dad grandma grandma - you that you touch them Lord the many needs that have come in we pray that father that you'd stretch forth your hand do a supernatural work now father we've come to your house to be fed tonight I asked you to annoy our lips bring us into the proper channel to where we need to be speak to us in a special way father if you speak father you'll change our lives and minister to us and we thank you for these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray a man and a man and a man you may be seated Saint John chapter 15 and verse 7 said if ye abide in me these are quite great words if he abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you Jesus himself is saying this herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit and so shall you be my disciples as the father hath loved me so I have loved you continue ye in my love and if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his loves these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you that your joy might be full and this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you next statements quite great greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends here my friends if you do whatsoever I command you watch these next statements henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what is Lord death but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you you have not chosen me God's going to lay the order out you have not chosen me but I have chosen you are you with me now that's quite a statement now you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit go to the work go live the life go be God in action be a living body living epistles read and known of all men if you'll remember when they were at one time at one spot in their lives they were had very different lives but after they met Jesus it was said about them these men had been with Jesus and they were first called Christians at Antioch Alleluia I'd like for my atmosphere to be so changed it's a great big statement I'd like from my atmosphere to be so changed sister Mary until someone would know me as a Christian before ever here in a word listen when God comes in your life when God comes in your life and you receive a real experience with God and every one of our experiences will be different many times mystical hard to explain to others what it was really like but you know that God changed your life because you can look back and see that something took place when you met Jesus more than a preacher more than a man but when you meet the voice behind the voice when you meet him you become different in your attitude your thoughts your desires you become a new creature in Christ Jesus [Music] are you with me now now I want you to just notice in Luke chapter 2 and verse 25 in verse 26 prophet begins to say but it was it was like it was revealed unto them by the Holy Ghost talking about Simeon that he should not see death until he's seeing the Lord's Christ he said I'm going to use the subject of expectation expectations are usually based upon faith and you can have time you have to have faith to have faith before you can expect anything and now many of those servants of God in the Old Testament says faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God I've often quoted it that God is obligated to his work he said I I like to read oh just a word or two of it because what I say will fail because I'm a man but his word cannot fail because it's God when God is caught on the scene at any time to make a decision and the first decision that God makes it has to be that same decision every time if he ever he'll one he'll heal another if he ever save one he'll save another remember God doesn't change his mind about his word he doesn't have a yearly conference to say this is what we're going to come under this year this is going to be the agenda God started his church like he wanted it he's going to finish his church life he started it are you with me and there's where you must solemnly place your faith on thus saith the Lord you must believe it that it's God's Word and that's the only hope that that you have the substantial hope that we have is on the Word of God and God be an infinite cannot make a mistake he's perfect therefore all of his all of his promises must be perfect as he is perfect are you with me in the middle of his promises he didn't have a - and he said but but on the basis or on the conditions or on the situation God's promises are a man and he backs his own word up in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us the word itself so therefore the Bible is the Word of God it is God himself I want to see God right there it is I want to hear God right there it is I want to know what God thinks right there it says that's a living book it's a book of action he said that's the way every seed of Abraham does today that's the born-again Christian that's the way the morning green Christian does today no matter what the world says what science says science just said this week but the RAM in the days of brother Branham is they had the science had three minutes to midnight this last week they've just changed that clock to 90 seconds 90 seconds to midnight they're only analyzing the condition of the world and how treacherous and how dangerous that it is are you with me we know it's coming to an end the whole earth is pressing to an end but we have an expectation tonight hallelujah in the world they have keynote speakers that will be the leading speaker they're trying to spark an interest to an audience to prepare them to lead them into an agenda for a conference of the direction that they're going to go generally they'll pick a very inspirational powerful speaker to be that man maybe a young man coming on the scene or a young woman coming on the scene that's almost that's almost just an up-and-coming star and they push them in that keynote role and it tries to spark an audience and you think about that there will go 80 90 thousand people to a to political audience and and they'll spark to them and they'll begin to try to tell them all kinds of things and you know without a shadow of a doubt 90% of its lies they can't they can't make their promises I know I don't mean to be difficult there but let me just say we come to the Church of the Living God tonight and sometimes we set with the arms crossed our thoughts and we walk in with thee the things of the day and week set like there's no expectation for this service but every service has the power to be the greatest service you've ever said it in your life well Ron I'd like to kind of know what it was like to to have lived in the days of Jesus I believe with this quote we can kind of tap into that he says now they believe the word to be the truth so they believed that he would keep his promises they gathered themselves and waited outside the gate and the city that went on with their ritualistic and religious worshippers of the city unbelievers went about their past religious people was at the temple doing all their ceremonial worship as they were celebrating something that happened back in Egypt but the believers were on their toes watching for him to come there were many in the city who loved him there's no doubt many believed in the coming of the Messiah but they didn't have the Spirit of God in them to draw him them to him there's millions today that go to church and worship but they don't know him just as they didn't then and he said so will it be it is coming they won't see him there were thousands in Jerusalem that felt expectations and that excitement that was going on they never did see him and a sad thing to say today yet the scripture must be fulfilled there's millions of Americans that go to church regularly and faithful that are never seen him when he comes because the bride will be caught away like a thief and the night will come and he will catch the bride away and the rest of them won't even see him think of it at millions going to church in a ceremonial worship but never see him when he comes the elected bride I believe I'm preaching to them the elected bride will be caught away just as it was then that out across and inspiration they gathered outside the gate they were talking with one another with perfect confidence that he'd come they said that there was an unbeliever passed by why you people are gathered out here light you up there up there out there worship he said we have something in our hearts we're waiting for the Messiah oh you bunch of religious FedEx fanatics you might as well said why don't you go out there with the rest of them something about it when a man and woman is born of the Spirit of God they don't go with the rest of them they go with God they go where he goes they worship with his people for God is spirited and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth that's the reason they wasn't with the rest of them and as they waited with long expectations after a while up across the hill came someone riding on a little white knew it was a type of he's coming the second time from heaven riding on a white horse coming over the hill with this little donkey little white donkey nobody had paid any attention to him but those that were looking for him Harlen those that were looking for him they cut down branches they ran out there screaming Hosanna to the son of David that comes in the name of the Lord their hats worth 300 and above measure and they were expecting him and all the expectations had been met they know the scripture said he would ride in Jerusalem on a mule hey saw him coming that's what we've done in this age we've recognized this coming well brother Ron what was a what it would have been like if if I'd have been in brother branham's me never been a ministry quite like this one oh there's been a lot of men with gifts and guessing and stepping out my faith and saying different things but never one that was an accurate actually even brother Branham would say at the end did he tell you exactly what was right did he do you believe that all your heart because God was borrowing of man it's what he wants to do with you today he wants to live in your life so much so that the world won't see you no more but they'll see God let's just I found this interesting today as I was looking and this kind of just there's something just pop out diggin and he's kind of almost having a conversation as he's having a prayer it's how do you do lady you speak English very well I'm a stranger to you you do not know me and I do not know you you got your baby and that's what you're interested in if Jesus will let you know something what you're here for will you believe him with all your heart sister your baby is very sick they really don't know what's the matter with it now watch now watch the accuracy of all this they really don't know what's the matter with it because it's got trouble in its neck it's got a gland swelling got gland trouble swelling that is right you was to take that baby to the doctor to the hospital it was about yesterday but you were holding off that's very good faith for a sinner whoo that's very good faith for a sinner now watch this now watch him all we can read the scriptures about the woman at the well we're gonna read the scriptures about the woman and well and see Jesus operating there he with me go call your husband I don't have any you've said right listen she was a woman reality she's woman a reality she'd hurt a lot of preachers she'd met a lot of men but this man had out water that she'd never thirst again and she was a predestinated seed sitting in a very bad situation others couldn't come to the well when she came to the well he said rot but you've had five husbands and the one you're living with he's not your husband and then she begin to get religious with him and then he had never declared who he was to all of the preachers in the synagogue's but to a predestinate his seed that needed to see exactly who he was and it was more than just see who he was but she had to see who she was are you with me listen tonight under our part of the spark of our expectation you must see more than just who he is but that revelation must be struck in your heart to come to life of what God deposited on the inside of your life it's a very good faith for a sinner and you quit the Catholic Church that's right and then you started going to a Pentecostal Church but you didn't join it and you've been back to that church you haven't been back to that church for about a year you don't know what to do this come upon your baby that you might serve the Lord now what's God watching over there seed this came on your baby that you might serve the Lord you remember in the tenth meeting in South Carolina that little baby was healed and that baby I had it baby in my hands and and that baby I prayed for that baby and and they begin to jump up and it ran all across the audience about 1100 people watching that event took place Andrew was standing right beside of my heart my side and he watched it all happen and that baby is just running everywhere and then the Lord spoke to me that girl that has brought this baby here she's from Florida and the baby is why she was here but the greater need and I told her the greater need is you need Jesus Christ in your life and she was a pop music star and that night she gave her heart to Jesus Christ sure there was a physical miracle that we could rejoice backwards and flowers and scream up and down and that tent came alive it just had a life on the inside of it but the greater miracle the greater miracle was that girl ignited to life she was thirsty in trying to fill it in a lot of different directions with the gift that was in her life but God had more plans I don't know preach right there for a while somebody's young preachers can take it and do something with it now go and be born again of the Spirit I'll bless the baby I thought about that I read that quote I thought about that brother Ram says a statement that she'd be she'd be familiar with being a former Catholic she'd be familiar with I'll bless the baby that wasn't brother branham's to do well brother branham is not the one that told her all of those events so it wasn't brother branham talking it was God talking just a moment I sent some someone else with a rosary that some woman standing by there they are a young lady sitting looking at me a lady sitting next to her it her is her grandmother she's suffering with stomach trouble that's right isn't it and you suffer with headaches and troubles isn't that right and you're both Catholic you believe that the Lord Jesus will save you and heal you right now and make both of you well will you believe it raise your hands if you will all right now put your hand over on the grandmother there and father God who made heavens and earth and all things possible to them that believe Romero every sin Lord I pray that you'll heal this darling little baby here and I take the curse off of it I'm praying this prayer in a lot of different directions now take the curse off of it it's too young to have faith may this baby live Satanists numbered its days but the mother has come to you Lord Jesus just now and now I curse this disease that it will not take the baby's life that Jesus Christ the Son of God will save the child and bless those who are holding it the hands up and below in Jesus name Amen now watch this now it's all over sister I want to ask you something you've never had a feeling like that you have now isn't that right you're also forgiving of every sin and your baby will live [Music] don't fear go on your road tell mother grandmother to eat what she wants to your headache see sister that's ladies trouble it's over and all over now just have faith and believe with all your heart Alleluia you know that's kind of what happens here we can look back 40 or 50 years ago but that's what happens here we're a birthing center where the message is not just on paper back or in the computer form or in digital format now or even even in voice but that message lives there's thousands of lives of voices wherever you're living that now God's taking this message that was in print now in in digital format now it becomes and live lives producing kind aftercon abroad on the earth preparing overcoming Laodicea having victory day by day by day by day even in almost almost sometimes like speaking to a mountain when you speak to it the first grain of sand rolls over you may not see it and that mountain may be there a while but you just keep speaking to it you just keep speaking to that mountain and that mountains gotta move by what authority if you bodied me and my words abide in you that same Abrahamic faith that same apostille power faith hallelujah that's what we're resting on tonight now as long as it's a dead letter and we look at as a historical form or back in the days if you all have been here you're only living in the glare of another day our grandma's Goddard ran post Gadar or another God all brother runs but the great meetings are behind that's your expectation it shows that your expectation has not been sparked oh hallelujah oh we've we salmon eyes the car we polish the car and we've got the car with all of its all of its powerful mood urn it's a beautiful car we enjoy the car and we enjoy the message but it needs some gasoline and it needs a spark to it to make it go down the road what we needs an old-fashioned Holy Ghost revival in our life to bring the word to life that'll be more than some mechanical word now in Hollywood they'll have a script writers maybe they'll take a historical figure maybe it would be a man we just would just step back to something that you can kind of some sort of a spiritual you bring it to but maybe it would be Cecil DeMille and and you've you've got you'd like to bring Moses to life you'd like to bring the Ten Commandments to life you like to bring it in such a much of a life until a prophet of the day would be enamored by the pillar of fire that was in there you'd like to bring it to life to word that people would not see the character or the man that is taken the script of Moses that they would see Charlton Heston but they would see a man so step into a role until it was more than just a mechanical of of speaking to where that the script would come so alive now you got to remember man like Charleston Heston would have to have a gift in his life to where he could hide himself so much all of his personal desires and all of his personal goals would be here away in a private life to where when he slept on set he was Moses and when he throwed the rock down and it turned to a snake he had become a God to Pharaoh he had to get anointed to be able to play the role had to have such a gift to bring him into that role to win he's stretching his hands out over the sea and the wind is blowing in his hair he writes even about it that he felt like it was so real Teli could see himself as Moses now that's Hollywood when it finished they gave them incredible crown of incredible amounts of money and rewards for their their great acting and this one got an award and that one got her Ward's Cecil DeMille got an award they'll always be remembered for those parts but after it was over with traulsen Heston had trouble going back into his private life because he had so become Moses until he lost his identification as Charles said have stood and he had to take on different roles to get himself out of that we're not role playing here to not watch me cannot I so want to lose myself in the Jesus crash I don't want to go back and find that man ever again [Applause] he is my source of strength he is my energy he is the one that feeds my soul day to day brother on my troubles and my situations and you remember when God came to job his friends had turned on him called him a sacred sinner his wife it even came to the point she was done with him it lost it all he had been a man that many people came to and rulers and Kings came to him and sought counsel with him he'd be a man that many people looked up to he was wealthy beyond measure had an incredible family but because a conference happen in heaven and because the conference happened in heaven what goes on in heaven goes on in the earth and a conference went on in heaven and God asked the enemy have you considered have you considered my surfing joke and and listen the enemy tells God you got a token about him you got a hedge about it you got angels watching over it and his word is protecting him are you listening now God's going to set this as an example for all humanity because God had confidence in the god that lived in job he had confidence in him brother Bram said God could have confidence in Abraham because he'd fellowship with him have you ever come to a place when you realize that you're not in the room by yourself this morning I was sitting in my office I was sitting there I'd been there about four hours I was sitting in my office and I just realized after a bit I wasn't alone sir will you saw my office and I'm sitting at the end of that table and I'm I'm listening to the word I'm I'm going through the quotes I'm reading I'm placing and I'm just following the path as it's opening up the channel as it begins to flow I'm just I've been flowing in it all week but it just seemed not not to be going in direction the you know and that it had to be going and god I just I just kind of felt like all of a sudden I'm not alone and then it just began to go we just began to just flow it begin to flow I would say that's kind of like Abraham was when he was sitting with him and he was looking across at a man and he'd entertained a lot of strangers but nobody spoke like this man and he realized he didn't have beginning today's or end of days and he was an eternal plan and this man knew about the covenant was between him and God and he explained that you know that thy seed will possess the gates of their enemy and he realized he wasn't talking to a man just sometimes you realize this is way more than a man God came to job I find it interesting that God doesn't talk any about his troubles when God came to job II he doesn't have a pity party with him he doesn't talk about his lost children his lost assets has lost his lost land and all different kinds of things and he's lost all of these things he gonna had a long list those that can't seem to get the light of day you might want to read the book of Job a little bit and especially 38 and I love God to speak to you when God talks to you he don't talk about temporary things many people make decisions about temporary things and temporary feelings you need to always base everything on the Word of God relationships on the Word of God marriages on the Word of God listen put God first and everything in your life and if God is your friend he'll back you up no matter where you're at where was you at job when I laid the foundations of the earth explain to mountains and rivers and the heavens and the zodiac and he took him through all of that where was you at imagine Joba had felt big in his life at times but now in the presence of God it's quite different I've had people that told me that they had a lot of questions they wanted to talk to brother Branham about whenever he would get out of the car all those questions what went they were gone his presence was different than anybody else right here in Richmond one of our brothers was a quick you know sometimes we find herself as critics when we really don't know you know it's kind of its kind of like you ever hear somebody talking about somebody they really don't know you know they just you know and you just stand there and go they don't know him they don't know it they're just talking foolishness they're just ignorant in their own thoughts they don't know him and so this man was kind of like a man in the scriptures named Zacchaeus he was his wife was coming to the meeting and as she was coming to the meeting that was done it was she was there and she was a real Christian and she'd go home and tell him so I I saw the pillar of fire man said the pillar Flyers over and said I looked and there it was they said angel Lord is here and he said I'll tell you I saw the angel of the Lord myself I've asked others they didn't sit by I saw it I saw it I saw this miracle I saw that miracle I heard of sermon I've never heard it place like that in my life that man's a prophet well her husband doctor said I put an end to this obviously not knowing the size of the meeting and not knowing people would be outside for hours before his arrival and and and he showed up at a meeting that was unlike any he'd ever been to and they had picked him they hand-picked him to take brother branham from the car you talking about accuracy hand fits him to take brother branham from the car to get him through the door and lead him to the stage now here's a creek and he gets hand-picked out of all these thousands of people that he would be the man to take brother branham from the from the car and he said you know I was standing there and I had lost lots of my heart and I you know I had a lot of questions I had a lot of things I wanted to say and he said when he got out of the car all that was going and said he sit there and talked to me and he said I could tell by his eyes he knew everything and I I was saying and said we kind of we kind of walked toward and I was right there with him he said it would kind of walk toward the building made her way through the crowd he said we got to the building he said brother brother just kind of turn said he was real gentleman said he just turns it would you mind holding my hat while I preach and he said there I was a real critic holding his hand and you realized this man's exactly what my wife said he was brother branham as he's preaching in New York to those businessmen they was expecting some great intellectual thought maybe some great great demonstration of gift and they thought he's going to say something eloquent to Herman and he comes to them and talks about Zacchaeus the businessman and what he's really telling them it's businessman Jesus wants to come to your house and you're finding yourself in a tree with a lot of garbage on you a lot of people live double lives one life in church and another life in another fact that's not a token life that's not a life worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ let Jesus stop under your tree take him home take him home make a welcome let him change your life what if Jesus came to my house it's more than a song what would you have to put up what would you have to hide there's anything in that list take care of it I said these words to you the other night night I couldn't get away from we talked about spark this is something that just moved me very deeply when you begin to think about what Adam stepped out of and God's great plan of redemption what he stepped out of we're about to step into are you with me now sometimes it grace brings us incredible sorrow to lose a loved one and I'm talking about it affects us for the rest of our lives for our loved one to step beyond that veil of Tears but if we can look at it the way glad looks at that last breath here was the first breath there to step from this realm sister Gabrielle she's getting ready to be mother again it's a lot of thoughts a lot of what this baby will be like she has three others will it be like this or that and it'll have its own nature and will have its own spirit have its own actions because written in the Lamb's Book what's that name that had to be expressed now this might have been a surprise to you but it was not a surprise to grok because that attribute must be displayed on the earth and as it comes there's an expectation to go through you remember what it was like to be a mother before but every every child has a different sequence in a different cycle and a different manifestation and that spirit of that child that warm presses are come to you and they become a different glow on you and you'll come into that season of giving giving that child birth now it's very comfortable where it's at the kicks it pushes it makes great actions it causes you heartburn you've been nauseated they'd like to stay but because of travail that child has to be forced and it takes between life and death to force that child from that world into this world help me preach now oh if we could just catch a moment the great expectation from this life to that life it's more real than this world [Applause] Neil Armstrong had always been enamoured as a child since a child he wanted to be on the moon he had an incredible sensational desire to step on the moon sits a kid it was born with that he was born with a desire nobody's ever been there he wanted to go there's a program that they were had an aspiration to put a man not just around the moon behind the moon but man can't live there so you have to take Earth's environment and go stand there so it has to be developed now why was that going on because there was a message with the people with a sensational desire hallelujah to live into two worlds at the same time hallelujah to be the bride of Jesus Christ and it was more than horse and buggy age and it was more than an airplane age but it was an astronaut age like an eagle just kept sorry higher and higher I've ever ever denominational Creed every cold Creed an idea an ism a man an organization of man to break every sound barrier every tradition barrier every realm every demonic religious power because God was creating an astronaut eggs to bring this back in the order for a rapture I don't know what it felt there's no way I could understand what it felt like but to have set in the seat and all of your dreams are now you've kissed your wife no I haven't seen the movie but to have kissed your wife and you don't know there's a lot of unknowns here it's a lot of unknowns but to sit in the chair buckle yourself in and all the ways that would be buckled and to feel the force getting ready there's been a lot of trial preparations have been an incredible amount of hours and just millions of hours spent in preparation but to hear those 10 everything I feel like going to the moon myself right now sometimes I walk to a pulpit and I know what I've got inside of my heart and what he's delivered to me it's like sitting on the top of a astronaut bubble ship and knowing we're going to take a trip for about an hour and a half in the heavenly realms and we're gonna leave Walmart and we're gonna leave our jobs we're gonna leave the situation's of life and we're gonna spend some time in the eternal and you can feel you can feel that momentum shifting to another gear and the word has priority and the word has an anointing and an inspiration to it it's got life it's got life and he would make the statement when he stepped out of that craft and he stepped down that ladder I remember as a boy in school they would play it over and over again one small step for a man one giant step for mankind Ruth types us when she said this in a very very very what you might say very small space with a lot of pressure and a lot of realm where thou dwellest were thy diced I'll die let me just go back to there and treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee whither thou goest I will go and if wonder if we say this to God oh but that was Ruth but Ruth is our kite whether thou goest I'll go whether they'll lodgest I will Lodge thy people will be my people thank God my god without dice will I die and there will I be burned the Lord do so to me and more also if aught but death part thee all but that was that was Ruth Genesis 32 and Jacob was left alone and that wrestled a man with him the breaking of the day and when he ever saw he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint near a sow with him and he said let me go the day breaketh and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me it was more than Jacob was involved in this all of Jacob's seed the mind of God was involved in a man wrestling with the angel this is much bigger than you I'm gonna bring it to a close in a little bit sometimes we get so consumed it's all about me forget that this is way bigger than you and lay on a sail we got this hiatus we're not looking for another messenger we're not looking for nobody to copy even brother branham but we're looking for the God that lived in Paul and Peter and James and John that same God to live inside of us and sometimes we got a wrassle with the angel knowing it's more than about me it's about my family my grandchildren my great-grandchildren do you know I pray for my grandchildren's spouse that's silly I pray for my children before they were born I pray for my grandchildren and their spouses because supposedly their spouses are on the earth we get so consumed with our children but what about listen this just hasn't accidentally happened oh I just walked in and I got lucky there's no luck involved in a real Christian no luck involved with a real Christian it's dedicatedly committed to it for God or the state but one time God don't need your best well would you hire a man if he told you that you wouldn't you didn't he he didn't need your best I am I know that we we must surrender our whole heart to God come on church but God needs all of you oh but I got all these abilities God's not even looking for your abilities he's looking for your dependability and then what he uses give your best to that what do you choose this to channel you will brother on all I know to do is a man and praise the Lord do it the best that you know how to do when you put your hands together let heaven hear it you just can't believe the unseen forces that you've overcome this week just to continue to be here this week or Sunday the registration for the youth camp came open they register over 500 young people 20 ages of I think 13 to whatever I preached that meeting several times and it's been supernatural every time that we've been there we've seen incredible miracles happen just to give you for instance so the last time I was there Mariah came through the prayer line God restored her hair I'm going somewhere with all this loot Dru walked across that platform and as I walked walked him across the platform I began to talk to them that cross this platform many of you later tonight is going to walk in a prayer line now maybe you don't believe in prayer lines and maybe you'll be critical but you might be like the man that talks about somebody he don't know if you've never been through a real godly anointed prayer life one that where man don't get all the attention but God is there to do the work where it's a showdown between God and the enemy I begin to describe it at that in a little while the people are going to walk across this by the hundreds we're going to preach the Word of God that will build faith to get you ready for this prayer line in a few moments you'll walk through this prayer line and you'll never be the same Moriah walk through that prayer line with three bobby pins in her hand with a with a hat on her head no hat but she walked across there with an expectation for the promise of God to be fulfilled her pastor had prayed for her brother Jim had prayed for filling unction that she was like the church the bride through seven church ages is to be restored to her original glory and she was a type of restoration you could see that girl today see her hair is beautiful and she's a beautiful lady hair all the way down the back now she's restored to her glory I'll never forget the first time that I brought her up on this stage after the miracle begin to happen and she had never taken her hat off in public and I begin to talk about the miracle that happened that God was restoring the glory because hair is the glory that God was restoring that glory back to her and when she took her hair off it felt like every atom in the building was electrified with the Holy Ghost it would be in that meeting it they would carry me off the stage and take me to the cabin suite we'll go to the cabin brother Aaron but the Tim winters carries me to the car wrapped in a big blanket he carries me to the car prayer lines still going on miracles are happening and let me just stop her just a moment the last one I prayed for was name sister Jessica Martin and when she came through the prayer line I remember the words that were spoke to her I give you back your son do you say well brother on by what authority do you have the Word of God are you with me somebody's got to put them the check and write it out it isn't a man about me it's about God's Word being fulfilled that was a son that needed to come home and it was in a very wayward condition maybe you boys knew that boy but that boy came to the Lord and it's a real Christian now and has a family dedicated his life to God why God came on the scene it's more than Hattie right I give you your boys what about your children let's call for the product us to come home let's call for moms and dads and wayward Christians where's our expectation all could it's Park tonight we would walk in the room but there is a real gentleman he takes us in the room and I just turned to him and I said you'll never be the same from this night forward you're you're called to preach the Ministry of the word of God that's been on a long time but from this night you'll never be the same get bid arms a big man begin to throw his irons back you said brother on I've heard that a hundred times hear it again here again he's suffering with the condition in his body that the doctors don't know what it is but I'll tell you the same God that was in that room I'm talking to you now by prophetically the same God that was in that room there's the same God that a heal his body obviously now the doctors has declared they they say he has symptoms of ALS and we know that's a horrible disease but God's greater God's greater than those initials God's greater than that demon power hallelujah I got a clip of him preaching the other night in Dallas Texas preaching and there was some of the most powerful preaching it only got about a six minute clip it was some of those powerful preach and I've ever heard boo devil boo devil stepping to the challenge of the hour when Goliath walks in your field you must meet the challenge and within seconds the vision comes of Isaac we've all enjoyed that miracle we've all enjoyed we've all enjoyed I want to take you give me just a couple more moments I know we have communion but one morning just at the end of the sleep I see a mineral a large audience sitting in this large audience I'm standing there and I'm going to say some things that are very prophetic here and I want to thank a friend of mine named Tim Pruitt for bringing it back to me you see last week you see a friend of mine sitting in this building brought me a prior cloth and had never been on anybody that we know of but it had been in acts 19 in a Bible I'm not gonna call his name for four reasons but this is one of brother branham's alas suits that he preached in and it had been in an attic for a long time but that's a promise of God brother on this is just another trial well that just shows you're not no you're not in the valley with me last week I walked to with the notes of although suffering standing be healed and that morning when I had that visitation I saw I saw a large crowd and brother Timothy Pruett comes to the pulpit and he preaches on the resurrection and the life and then brother temper comes to the pulpit and he begins to it begins to address the audience and he said I have a special friend here and he calls me by name and said but the wrong Spencer and that's an important part although suffering stand and be healed he left me are you listening me and when it was over there was such an atmosphere in our bedroom until I danced across that bedroom and I spoke in other tongues because I believe in that and a road brother Tim pretty quickly and send him the note of the of the vision and the dream and I just I just I just I guess cynic I send and I didn't we give it full full sentences in total description but it had power to it that morning I sent it brother Davey before you had the accident this week brother Tim went back to time check it to make sure that I sent that before you were wrapped around a tree because that vision of Isaac had to come to pass and it had to come through you Satan couldn't take your life and you're a son of God and those promises are to a son that all hinge on you forever it's not his life the cake wrapped around the tree inches from your life crushed in your body and doctors would say you never have a child but God's face and had to take place Whitney's womb was built to work she couldn't have a child but God's Word had to take place my mother would have a heart attack later that evening and on Sunday morning God impressed Saturday night after service God spoke to me to go to her side and that next morning I went to her side and on the way they called and said she was coding and brother Tim calls me and he said brother on your version is about to happen both of them will stand and be healed Davey will stand and be healed and your mom is getting ready to stand up into a new body but there Hendra and myself walked into the room and I think about eight different people was working on my mother and my mother was as calm as I am right now maybe calmer had a little conversation with her and they went right back to work and the doctor came to her and had his last conversation and he said Christine and he begins to talk to her and she said I'm ready to go and she went Hollywood can't write it when your last words are not fear I'm ready everything that's not Neil Armstrong that's a child of God from one room to another round thirst evening brother Tim calls me or you you know I tell him I said I'll call you when I get finished so he so he we waited as a day went on my day went a little bit longer than I expected to go brother Tim just wrote me a little note he said are you are you something to the effect are you ready now and literally I was walking through my door at the house I literally was stepping through the door and I just called him and I said I think you've got a camera on my house we spoke for about an hour and talked about things stuff and then after about 20 minutes we came to this this what I'm holding now brother Tim has preached this that I know of about five times in very large conventions and you talk about massive miracles have happened to people he never saw the vision I did he got a spark are you catching it now he got a spark off of it this vision is more than happening and it's more than for people it's more than for David it's more than for my mother it's for the entire pride may this bride standing be healed [Applause] you can you can stay standing now but he said brother on I want to tell you in that visitation he said I did not you I did not call Davey's name I did not call your mother's name I called you your name and he said Ron Spencer stand and be healed now here's how it all happened you can't arrange it we had that conversation literally literally in the same spot in the floor where I was speaking in tongues trying to put all that together we're years now waiter and I and I get to the privacy of my room and I'm sitting in a certain spot and we come to that part of the conversation and he says Ron Spencer stand and be healed and I said I'm sitting in the same spot what about your situation what about your need not just your physical need but that eternal part could you reach out by faith those even in the unseen on its could you reach out by faith let Jesus take your life there's something with it maybe you've been a wanderer maybe you've been a Jacob in your life grab a hold a sit with the angel of God don't turn loose not just you it's more than about you so many times we make very selfish temporaries listen putting at stake our family our family's family our church and our whole reputation on the line and I have nobody in mind there but Satan will destroy you what about your Goliath what about your mountain all may there come a spark of faith in your life what about your time what about your moment right now season some moments come and go recognize he's here brother Branham says whatever you do don't miss it don't miss it there's boys on the road to emmaus almost missed it but they compelled him to come in he'd spent six hours describing what the word said he would be and did he do it did he do it did he do it brother brems said he opened the eyes of their understanding may God open your eyes tonight hey man let's pray let's pray before we go to communion now Lord Jesus what a mindful God you are oh if we could walk into a service with our spark of expectation that we come to see Jesus I'll see a man not to hear some great theory or some deep revelation but you would live in our lives or do we realize who we are and not just realize who we are but that same Abidin of Jesus Christ that's same as brother man we used to turn 3rd pool would live in our lives that same mystery of Christ would be the entire word displayed in son of us come Lord we don't want to artificial experience just to believe on something theory just because we can put some scriptures together maybe a quote or two together that don't make it but we gotta have life may we get desperate before you Father Lord I ask you to touch every hand this went up across this audience Lord those that are sick this evening I pray that you touch their bodies fevered browse father Lord we we apply your word Lord we take you at your word father don't we call for the elders of the church and we pray father with fervent prayer praying that you heal them Lord raise them up father sometimes we get so sick we can't even pray for ourself like that baby couldn't have faith for itself Norden let us reach out father enter that realm of faith they'll touch Jesus minister to us this evening in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen bless you maybe we could sing that song touching Jesus is all that really matters in your life will be the same Amen god bless you amen brother Jeremy will dismiss our our streaming audience just now we're half communion god bless you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
