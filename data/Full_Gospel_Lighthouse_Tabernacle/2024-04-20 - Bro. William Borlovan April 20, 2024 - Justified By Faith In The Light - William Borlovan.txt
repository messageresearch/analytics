them early Christians had was lost because the Antichrist Spirit begin to come and creep its way into the church but God said I will restore I will restore everything thing that the Locust and the canker arm and the caterpillar has eaten and we're contending for the same Faith of Our Fathers he said it would be here and she's here you are she not only here in Elton Virginia but she's a bride standing around the world like a mighty Army a very Vindication of the word of God God seen you before the foundation of the world he said you'd be here and here you are though Millions tens of

we commit this service into your your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you we certainly again greet you in the lovely name of Jesus we just greet our visitors amen God bless you and we just want to continue to remember brother Andrew there in the youth service in Tennessee I know they're having a glorious time and certainly looking forward to hearing everything the Lord has done amenl if you'll turn with me this evening to the gospel of St John we'll read in several places but St John chapter 1 and then Romans then over to Romans and then the book of First John so I'll kind of try and go slow between each reading there to give you a chance to flip but we'll begin with first John chapter 1 do you love the Lord tonight amen thank the Lord Jesus in John chapter 1 we'll begin with the first verse in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light now John the Baptist was a light but he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came into his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God Amen Romans chapter 8 verse1 just one scripture reading here Paul's speaking he said there is therefore now no condemnation say no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit in 1 John chapter 1 verse five John is the disciple of Love is that right and the and the bride has got a very special connection as as you're flipping there the bride has got a very special connection with the disciple of John both in the gospel there's very interesting things that he covers there that's not covered by the other other disciples but in 1 John chapter 1 verse verse chapter 1 verse 5 excuse me this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if everybody say if but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and that's a very powerful important conjunction there the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated I want to read verse 7 again but if we walk in the light as he is in the light see these are very important ingredients here very important scenario because you have to not only walk in the light but you have to walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin with the help of the Lord I'd like to title this this evening just Jus ified by faith in the light in St John chap 8:31 Jesus speaking he said then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed see the Bible would a lot of times classify nominal Believers and Believers as the disciples the the people were called Disciples that actually followed him for the for the Loaves and for the fishes and the Miracles but when the the word began brother Jerry to be laid down True Discipleship was tested as Jesus said if ye continue in my word so as the word unfolds you you prove your election by being able to continue in what God is doing in your day and age now what is light we know in the natural that we know what light is we know what that is but there's also a spiritual light light is when God will vindicate his word whenever in other words vindicate means to bring it to pass when God speak something it's a promise out there whether it's through a prophet or when God said let there be light if it might have been thousands of years before the light actually manifested it wasn't light yet but whenever light natural light literally began to to to burst forth that then became God's word was Vindicated God then proved that he was God because when he said let every seed bring forth of its kind and each seed actually brought forth of its kind then that then Vindicated that God what God Said that God was God so light is when the word is manifested and he vindicates his word by bringing it to pass we all have a desire to serve a living we a living God we want reality we don't just want forms we don't just want Creeds we don't want religion I can't stand religion I can't stand being religious Cain was religious I want to be a true Holy Ghost filled Christian Satan is religious it's not it's not about religion people kill in the name of religion all the time now in the sermon there is a man here that can turn on the light he says now what God Said separates Darkness from light or light from darkness and he separates death from life and he does it by his word his word is what always brings us forth now light well now the seed was already in the earth I believe God had planted the seed just as long as the sun could get to that seed it began to grow so when God created the heavens and the Earth the seed was laying in the earth and then but the the Earth was dark and it was void and there was nothing to bring forth the life all that seed needed that was in the darkness of the earth and in the chaos was a little light to get on it and when the light fell and begin to warm the Earth the seed the power of that seed was already within itself so just like the elect of God you were in darkness and all you needed was the s o n to shine on your elected seed and you sprung forth that's all you needed all it needed was life he says so life is only by the word of God made manifest life comes only by the word of God May manifest as long as it's just in the book like this it can still be questioned but when it's manifest when it's made manifest then you see the product of what it spoke of being manifested now that does not give us a right to question it just because it hadn't come to pass because God has a perfect track record but the prophet is making the point that when it's in when it's in in word form it hasn't shine forth yet but then whenever it's Vindicated and then people when people doubt that that's sin that's right that in essence is real Sin when God said something and then it brings it and then people will sit there and they'll analyze it and they'll try inject their own ideas but then God actually brings it to pass and then people reject it that sin they're a sinner I don't care how many times they go to church a week they reject the manifestation of the word for that day and that's sin the priest never missed a sacrifice the priest never missed a day at church the priest never missed a religious order but yet they rejected the very word in flesh in St John 3 Jesus speaking 18 he said he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath believed not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation that light is coming into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light they literally love the the the darkness more than light when the word is manifested and and there's no how many people would come to the prophets to to the prophet secretly say we know it's the truth we know what baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is the right we know the godhead and how you're preaching is right but if we preach that we're going to lose our congregation they love Darkness more than light they were Sinners so people are always looking what are the works of God what what you know there can be zealous religious they're zealous to do religious Works they're good people so Jesus so they came to Jesus with the same question and they said unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God you know what Jesus's response was this is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he hath sent well I thought the works of God were building hospitals I thought the works of God was feeding the poor that's nothing against that but the real works of God is to believe on him who he has sent in Zechariah 14:6 we see the prophecy laid forth and I want to go over just some basic fundamentals some of them here this evening because I know there's new ones amongst us and it's always good to Bear rehearsing yes in Zechariah 14 it's a scripture that was laying there for hundreds and hundreds of years it says in verse six and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light now that prophecy was in this Bible for hundreds and hundreds of years but now that God sent a message that was the manifestation of that scripture we could literally get our finger on the on that scripture in the Bible and say this day that scripture has been fulfilled and there's justification upon believing that and there's condemnation upon disbelieving that in Luke 1724 for as the lightning what is the lightning it's the Sun the light as it as as the lightning lith out of one part under the heaven shineth into the other part un under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day right then he begins to get the days of Noah and he begins to typen for his day and in verse 30 even thus shall it be when the son of man is revealed as the sun went rises in the East see Jesus was a very simple man he was God but he was hiding his Simplicity he could sit and he could sit on a rock with his disciples and begin to talk about a sewer went forth to se he say whenever the clouds are red and lowering you say this and whenever it's this color you say this and it's so and then he look up and say as the sun rises in the East and sets in the west so shall the coming of the son of man be he would get on the on the level of Nature and you see the same Jesus Christ in this message begin to take a seed the spoken word is the Original Seed and begin to look at a wheat plant or begin to look at a corn stock and be able to preach the church age from the churches and how Jesus had to die except the corn of wheat fall on the ground that's language that we all understand because we understand that when you plant a seed it literally has to die and burst forth to reproduce itself in a multiplied form so as the corn comes up it's a type of the church and as it gets stronger and stronger and then by the time it gets to the ear of the Corn it's to reflect what was put in the ground the bride Ministry now reflects what was put in the ground amen so see it's God hiding in Simplicity that is God revealing himself he hides himself in Simplicity and then he reveals himself in the in the same so we see as the gospel when Jesus came it was there in the Middle East and then after he after the day of Pentecost it was geographically you can literally this is simple you can literally get a map get a globe and you can see where Jesus was and his disciples and where Paul was in Asia Minor and it was in the East and the gospel went there but then the gospel began as God began to unfold himself to the Gentiles it began to move further west so after Paul whenever that Antichrist Spirit came in in the church ages they went through the Dark Ages it was moving a little further west well all of a sudden Martin Luther caught that the just shall live by faith he was further west he was in Germany Europe and then what came after that then come John Wesley with sanctification even further west the prophet said it crossed the English Channel into England and then from there the Pentecostals on the west Co in in America the west where did the pro where did God have his Prophet go meet seven angels in the west so far west that if you go any further west you're back East again so did the gospel in fact move from the East to the West exactly like Jesus said we're living in that manifestation because just like Naturally Speaking if you got the July Sun you we some of us are planting gardens if right now if next week the July Sun sprung forth the strength of that sun it would kill your garden but God has got the season so laid out so perfectly that the strength of the Sun is there for what's needed because when you're when the corn or the wheat is ready to be harvested you can't have the weak May or February Sun you need the the strength of the sun needs to match the stage of the crop so now that we've come through all these seven Church ages and God has sent a message and he shine forth in the strength of his son s o n the Lord Jesus Christ in the fullness of the word with all Seven Seals open what are we doing we're laying in the presence of the son to ripen to mature the shuck has pulled away that was Pentecost they pull away so now the real seed is laying in the presence of the sun waiting for what to go to the Garner the full strength praise the Lord Jesus because we cannot have Luther's sunlight for a body change we can't have Wesley's light for for a body change we need stronger light we can't have the Pentecostal light for a body change we needed the so wind we needed the rising of the sun to be in its fullness because we need a body change we needed a Rapture message the message of Luther was light for that day and there's bride right now in the presence of God that believe that light right but because like Jesus said if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed so whenever God moved on to Wesley but people are like no I I don't know Wesley I don't believe it we've got Luther we know the just shall live by faith that's right but God then moved on to Wesley so if you were a real disciple you'd continue in his word to Wesley and then from Wesley they moved on to the restoration of the gifts well we don't believe in the gifts because we've got sanctification that's all we need God you can't put God in a box to have light and darkness you have to be where the pillar of fire is when it moves you move that's what God even told them he said and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and by night he took not away the pillar of cloud by day nor the pill pillar Fire by night from before the people you could have just gotten your tent all set up man you were comfortable you're about to eat supper brother Adam you your wife just cooked you the your favorite dish but that you you look out your window and that Pillar of Fire is moving what are you going to do eat cold food you got to move you've got to move when the pillar of fire moves you better move with it [Applause] but see in in the form of a church that's that's why we have denominations do you understand that's why we have denominations because they Camp around the pillar of fire moved on and said no we're going to stay right here and that's why we have a Lutheran Church we have a Methodist Church because when God moved from John Wesley when God did the work through him and moved on and restored the gifts they said nope we're staying right here and God left them there Psalm 11915 says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path if you want to know how to walk you bet you we need to be in the light now in Matthew chapter 17 Jesus is vindicating both John the Baptist and brother brandham do you know Jesus literally mentioned brother brandham he talked about his Ministry in St joh excuse me in Matthew 17:10 and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things Hallelujah but I say unto you that Elijah is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise also likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake to them of John the Baptist Elijah truly shall come and restore all things and John the Baptist has already come he knew brother Brandon was coming right of course he did and how does that make us feel to be able brother Jordan to be able to look in that and say God has given me to ear given me a hear to ear an ear to hear God has given me an ear to hear what the spirit said I heard the Elijah that shall come here I am I'm a product of his ministry now every beautiful prophecy that you that we read of Jesus in the Old Testament had no redeeming power to it until until it became flesh Isaiah 53 Isaiah 96 all them beautiful prophecies and and things could not redeem heal or save in Prophecy form people were holding on to it they kept believing they kept waiting for it waiting for it but as soon as one day that Isaiah 53 was going down a cobble a Roman cobblestone street right with a cross on his back that meant something when the prophecy of Isaiah 53 in flesh was tied to a whipping Co a post and beat to an absolute unrecognizable pulp that did something for you that did something for me when that prophecy hung on the cross and said it is finished that did something for you that did something for me when that Roman spear was thrust into his precious side that bought my new birth the potential was there and all the power and everything that this word held it was bound with Seven Seals it was there in potential power form but it couldn't be released to the church until the Seven Seals were broken right then all the power behind this word is in you right if you have the Holy Ghost all the power all of Heaven brother Ram said is behind this word just like all the redeeming power behind Jesus came into effect when he became flesh and salvation became a reality when he gave his life and he said it is finished then it went from prophecy to reality then we could benefit from it so all this prophecy about the son of man coming and and thus shall it be when the son of man is revealed and behold I'll send Elijah the prophet unto you it was a promise it was a seed it was a wonderful promise but now it's been manifested now the seals have been torn off and now you're told come look come and see come eat of this Tree of Life come eat it now the Seven Seals are more than just horse riders right amen because see the the seals reveal Christ the horse riders are the spirit of antichrist or is Satan so the seals expose the enemy but laying under the seals is Christ and under Christ is his bride you're in there when one of these brothers get up and they preach predestination that's preaching from an unsealed book and you say glory to God I've been predestinated my natural birth could keep me from this word that's you hearing your name in the book when water baptism is is preached correct water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is preached that's from an open book it's still the seals being preached because when the seals were broken all the mystery truths were uncovered sure some some small groups had had the true baptism name because they had part but God sent a prophet in this end time to and reveal all the seals and now this bride Ministry around the world when she gets up and the ministers get up and anointed and given a sermon inspired by almighty God that is the opening of the word to you because the bride is bone of his bone flesh of his flesh that's why the token could only be preached after the seals that's why that was the highlight of the message despite everything the devil tells you you're okay if you have the new birth you're okay and if you don't have the new birth don't you stop until you get it in John one that which was from the beginning which we've heard which we've seen with our eyes which we've looked Upon Our Hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we've seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father it was manifested unto us that's God condescending they begin to handle the word of life no matter how much chaos was in the world when light shined it put everything in its place Rahab if you want to talk about chaos you think about Rahab there was a lot of dirt that Satan threw on her life but no matter how much dirt that he kept trying to dump on her life dump on her life dump on her life she still came forth in Psalm 139 David speaking where shall I go from thy Spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence think of this when you're an ordained sister Deborah when you are an elected child of God where can you go and be away from his presence it doesn't matter if it was while you were in sin or now that you've got the Holy Ghost it doesn't matter you've never been out of his watch David said if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if I say surely the darkness of sin let's say shall cover me even the night shall be light about me when you are in your darkest sinful State he can still see that elected seed in you because Darkness and Light is the same to God no matter how dark and and how much you know to Hell Satan took you God still seen you as his child yay the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike unto thee do you know the prophet said that Rahab was actually forced into prostitution by her own parents she was a beautiful young girl and they were pagans and they needed an income you think about that that's terrible but that was Satan but yet in spite of all that whenever The Messengers came into Jericho she believed she didn't ask to see Moses's Rod where you where they turned into a snake they didn't ask she didn't ask to see a bottle of fleas that maybe were created she believed everything that Moses said and then she believed the Joshua a Ministry and she said give me a sure token all she did she heard but now she's seen and you look at with her past and everything that happened yet she still wanted her parents saved she still exercised forgiveness in her heart to say I want my family in I want my mom I want my dad in yeah for her household she had to find forgiveness in her heart and then we know that she was actually married to an Israeli General salmone and then they had Boaz together you think of the grace of God a girl that lived that lifestyle not by choice yet God through that Darkness could still see the light that was on the inside of of her grafted her as it were into the nation of Israel and then they had a baby and it wasn't just any baby it was Boaz here she was the reality her past didn't matter she would believe the word for her day that justified her and she here she was holding a type of Christ into the lineage the natural lineage of our Lord Jesus Christ because remember Boaz typed the Redeemer we're reading the book of Ruth here with the with the kids not long ago and we got to just kind of discussing it it just kind of made me see A New Perspective on it you know whenever Ruth and and orpa whenever they married them boys and they ended up dying and we're familiar with the story yet Ruth had a drive in her that she wanted to go with Naomi and I just kind of wonder what if it was her husbands that told her her husband that told her all about the great Jehovah oh yeah how they came through the Red Sea and how they came through the promised land and how Joshua came and divided the land but here they were in Moab and her husband was taken off the scene yet she there was such a thirst that got ignited in her that whenever she was given the option to go back she said where you go I will go because she was predestinated so Rahab became a queen among women in the nation of Israel because of who she produced Boaz right and if a Scarlet thread if believing Joshua and a Scarlet thread as a token and and and what it did for her what would the blood of Jesus Christ do for you what does the blood of Jesus Christ do for me Justified that is a powerful thing in Romans 51 Paul speaking said therefore being justified by faith we have peace through God through our Lord Jesus Christ being justified by faith now when you're Justified that's not just forgiven Justified is literally as though you've never done it and we're going to we're going to get into some wonderful things about justification in Colossians chapter 2 and you being dead in verse 13 and you being dead in your sins and the Earth circumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us took it out of the way nailing it to his cross brother Randy he literally blotted out the handwriting that was against us because remember there's an old account and Satan's a good bookkeeper he's a good recordkeeper and he likes he likes to record all he he'll he'll set a trap he he likes to record your mistakes and then thumb back through them and say mhm look here this was on let's see April the 1st [Music] 19 88 and he's he's a Record Keeper but so is my God Satan's record don't matter nothing because the Bible says in Romans 8 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justif ified and whom he justified them he also glorified it's a finished work we're walking into it now see there's to get to the New Birth there's three stages there's justification there's sanctification and then there's the Holy Ghost so the first thing you have an inclination toward God and you repent of everything you can think of and you take on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and God forgives you you you do it sincerely you do it with a broken heart and God forgives you but then what happens is you keep making the same mistakes and you keep asking God to forgive you he does you make another mistake God forgives you so then you have to cry out to the Lord to be Sanctified because when you fall into into the same cycle you need to literally be Sanctified from that cycle so then you you pray and you say God I'm tired of this catching me every time I'm tired of falling over this same thing I need you to actually take it out of my heart I need you to take the desire of this out of my heart and you you you keep in fellowship with Believers and you keep crying out to God and God will do it because promised amen so then you're Sanctified I don't have a desire to drink anymore I don't have a desire to lust anymore I don't have a desire of this I don't I don't lie anymore that just God took it away from me overnight God Sanctified you but don't you stop don't you stop it's then you have to ask God to fill you to fill you with the Holy Ghost with he himself with a very presence of God indwelling you then you become a holy ghost Born Again child of God you're a child of God during that process too but see the the problem is that people get Justified and that's it and they'll never be able to break a cycle they'll never be able to overcome something because they're just Justified God forgive me God forgives them the next day God forgives them God forgives them but God intends for you to then go on to sanctification yes Lord and then when you're all cleaned out and you're all scoured out Jesus taught on this remember he said when the unclean spirits come out go out of a man they walk in dry places and then they come back trying to get back in that is why after a person gets Sanctified you want to stay there and desperately cry for the Holy Ghost right but now in Romans when ever it says whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he justified and whom he justified them he glorified that's what God already done for you right you're just walking into it by his grace this isn't like where people drop off in justification or drop off in sanctification he's already done it if you're predestinated to be glorified then you're predestinated to be justified you're already called you already elected you're already placed he did all that but it starts with the ho Holy Ghost by believing the word of your day and not just you know we hear it and man I believe that like I believe it like it's something like yeah that's the truth yep it is but we've got to see it live in our lives we've got that's what being a Christian is being a Christian is not enough to say that's the truth that's the Son of God I I believe God sent a prophet yep absolutely but whenever it becomes a living reality remember that story brother Ron you said that when you were weren't living right you got in a fight with a man over the Vindication of a prophet but it wasn't living in him yet that's the difference because remember the Bible said being confident you got to be confident in this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us what Satan has on you don't matter because really it's on him he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died y rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us the devil didn't die for you the devil can't die for you Jesus Christ died for you so why would we listen to what the devil brings up his books are not accurate he's not a good bookkeeper he he records yeah but once our sin is dipped into the precious blood of Jesus Christ he said now your old book is gone with your old Union God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness you stand perfectly before God perfectly before God now your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb redeemed because we have two books the first book is our natural birth that's what we want put in the sea of God's forgetfulness it's not in the sea of our forgetfulness we don't have that it ain't the SE if the devil's forgetfulness he ain't going to forget it and he's is going to do everything he can to make sure we don't but whose Vision are we looking through he said your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate Hallelujah where your Eternal germ from the beginning takes hold now you're not only forgiven you're Justified right Glory he said Justified Look up the word the word don't mean forgiven the word means Justified it don't mean you're forgiven it's not just cuz if you're forgiven you actually did it but somebody forgave you of it but when you're Justified you never did it in the eyes of God you've never done it look at your neighbor and say I'm perfect and if you're sitting next to your spouse brother Vernon say it again now why are they laughing and shaking their heads because they don't see you with the same vision God sees you all the time because they because our spouses know each other we we know each other according to the flesh according to our human spirits but when we look Through The Eyes Of God he sees Perfection he sees perfection in Colossians 1:22 21 and you who were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in your own sight in his sight because if you are perfect in your own sight then that's called arrogance that's called Pride amen but it's about how he sees you right because he's the judge thank God so it's all about how he sees you and if he sees you perfect it don't matter what the Devil Himself sees you like he ain't your judge he's your accuser and the great judge is going to put him in the lake of fire with his record books that's where he's going with that it's important to see ourselves in the light of the word as God sees us we look we're also to examine ourselves that the Bible tells us and say Lord I see these imperfections I need you to help me see we judge ourselves not one another and God will work on you it's all about what God because what God sees is that's the real reality if God sees you healed you're healed Hallelujah if God sees you Holy Ghost filled you're Holy Ghost filled because remember the ladyo in church age sees itself as just the most beautiful thing the most spiritual thing and Revival and just such a have need of nothing isn't that what the Book of Revelation says they're inrich increase with goods and have need of nothing they've got it going on but look how God sees them wretched miserable blind blind and naked so just as the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost comes into you it makes you so completely dead to sin there'll be Temptations sure if you'll make mistakes sure but the desire for sin has completely been burned out of you the token is positive proof that God has accepted your faith right in his sacrifice the bleeding word when he seals you with the Holy Ghost that shows it is a finished work and it's literally stricken from the books of God and Satan is going to burn in the lake of fire with all of his accusations and he knows it's coming now back to the difference between forgiven and Justified he said for instance you heard I got drunk and did some evil things and everything then you come around say to me you find out I didn't do them then you come around and say brother brandom I forgive you he says forgive me I never got drunk he said now if I did do it I'm guilty but you can forgive me and but he said but yet I'm not justified because I actually done it now I do believe that a sincere nominal Christian sincere that that they find forgiveness for their sins amen am I I would love to to hear I love hearing testimonies of just people been delivered from a life of sin and there they're they're serving the lord of the best their ability God bless them but see we're talking about a church versus a bride before the opening of the word everybody thought that the church was one lump sum lump sum everybody thought it was just one the church the church but God revealed in this end time that there's a bride and a church and justification being sinless justified only comes through the token life of Jesus Christ it only comes through believing the word of your day justification in the sense of being totally sinless in the sight of God only comes through believ in the word of your day because that's the only way the Holy Ghost come you remember brother talking about that drop of ink going in the bleach and it's so destroyed it goes back to its origination it can't be found anymore and the prophet of God said all of your sins go back to the devil from where it originated from in John 3:16 let's read Verse 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light that's the condemnation do you know it's a lot harder to go to hell than it is to Heaven if you really think about it I never once heard the prophet of God say you got to fight your way to heaven but you have to fight your way to hell right because when when because to to be a Christian you you believe like he said he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already in another place he Jesus himself speaking said if I had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin now why would he make a statement like that because he was the word made fles flesh and he came and he was absolutely everything the Bible said he would be and his generation looked at him and refused him and killed him he said but now they have no cloak for their sin let's bring that on up to our day it's important that in our minds we not always think of Jesus Christ is always just 2,000 years ago he came what he's a very present he's the word and while while people carnal Believers in their mind may only think of him as being you know virgin born 2,000 years ago they can't see him of his work through the church they can't see they don't know but you've been made privy to it that he's actually came through a Vindicated prophet and now he's come through the through through the body of his bride she is him but see had they had this message not come the denominations would not have had sin because they wouldn't know any better but now that the word has come Jesus said they have no cloak for their sin because Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect you think that can put if you don't have an understanding that can put a lot of pressure on you Jesus God himself saying you got to be perfect the prophet of God on the first seal said Jesus said be you therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and how could we even start the thought of being perfect but Jesus required it and if Jesus required it he's got to make a way for it aren't you happy to serve a loving God like that he'll make a requirement but then he'll make a way and he said said and he has his own blood now I'm not perfect in your sight you may not be perfect in my sight but what about in God's sight that's where it lays and if you're born again into the body of Christ and God looks upon you as a perfect as Christ was himself right amen and if you're born again in the body of Christ then God looks upon you as perfect as Christ was himself thank you're so perfect in the eyes of God if you have the Holy Ghost you're so perfect in the eyes of God you're going to miss the day of judgment that's right you're going to be there but you're going to be on this side of the Judgment bar because remember Christ was only smitten once isn't that how Moses got in trouble right brother Joel whenever Moses went and he he he got a temper he got his The Temper got the best of him and he and he smoked the rock twice but he he couldn't go into the promised land it was such a major deal Christ was the only smitten once so if the bride is the body of Christ and she's got to stand in judgment wouldn't he be smitten again he took our judgment for him he took our judgment for us if we we as the body of Christ had to be judged then that would be like Christ being smitten twice you think about that born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies yet there was a blood that was shed that was so powerful that brother Thomas every mistake that you've ever made is now cleaned off and God looks at you as perfect and then when come the day of judgment despite what the world thinks and how many how many you know that they they spread their ashes on the moon or send it to a rocket or whatever they're trying to do and Escape judgment they're going to resurrect and they're going to stand before God and give an account but yet there's been a blood because you accepted the word and God gave you the Holy Ghost and you're so Justified brother Jim that you'll actually be sitting with him in the Judgment as his Queen we judge ourselves as I said now by this word but God's going to have a glorious Church God's going to have a glorious church that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish now in Matthew 25 if you'll put that up for me in verse 31 let's let's read this and when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats now we're all expecting a body change in a Rapture before our bodies change change all the elected bride of Jesus Christ is going to resurrect first that is the first resurrection our bodies will then be changed you have the Holy Ghost and you're born again your body will be changed and we're going to meet the Lord Jesus in the air that's right now this scripture that we're reading is the second or also called the general Resurrection this is where righteous people come this is where Wicked people come this is where Hitler is going to come this is where Stalin's going to come this is where Cain's going to come all of them and then the good people too and on the day of judgment God's going to separate as sheep from the goats as we just read and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for for I wasn't hungered and he gave me meat I was thirsty and he gave me drink I was a stranger and he took me in naked and he clothed me I was sick and he visited me I was in prison and he came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw he thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in as much as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me they didn't literally have to bring clothed Jesus but because they clothed you when you needed it God looks at you as himself whenever Saul or Paul when he was still Saul when he was coming down the road of Damascus and and he fell off his horse when he seen the pillar of fire what did Jesus tell them Paul or Saul Saul why persecutest thou me but he was killing Believers so see the body of Christ is like Christ himself right and there's going to be people on the day of judgment that's going to get Grace because of how their attitude was toward you and how they ministered to you that is why I say if you're on the workplace or something like that and somebody and a customer or a coworker tries to do something nice for you let them do it because you never know the reward attached with that you know the brother Ram said in the church AG book not getting brother Jeffrey not even getting someone a cold glass of water that's right in the name of the Lord God will reward you for that so God looks at you you're bought by his blood you're perfect and on the day of judgment brother Jerry you can say Lord that man did something for [Applause] me God is a god of mercy and sometimes when we preach this message it can maybe to people that don't understand it can seem so harsh like y'all think y'all are the only ones going no we're not the only ones going to heaven but to be in this bride you got to have an ear to hear this message that is a truth that will never be compromised on but there'll be millions of people going to heaven that are good people he said Paul brother R is quoting Paul here in 1 Corinthians 6 do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters know you not that we shall judge Angels how more of things that pertain to this life remember in the Book of Revelation Jesus said to him that overcometh will I grant him to sit with me in my throne right that's where judgment is as I have overcame and sat down in my father's Throne remember Jesus also talks about the queen of the South and he talks about whenever he's he's preaching to this generation he's performing the signs of the Messiah and they refuse him and he turns and he says the queen of the South will rise up with this generation and condemn it because she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here the queen of the South will be sitting with the Lord Jesus in judgment and be able to say that I came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear from a man with a gift of God in his life the men of Nineveh will stand in the judgment and condemn that same generation because Jonah came out of the belly of a fish and just in tyght preaching just the resurrection was just in tyght brother Gabriel just in tyght how much more when the son of man himself came and resurrected and they disbelieved when you remember when Jesus went to hell for the souls that didn't repent the long suffering days of of of Noah he didn't bring them a little Arc he didn't bring a little model and say why didn't you believe why didn't you get on here he he was the ark the bride will not go through the tribulation period amen thank you Lord the church WIll for its purification but not the bride he said notice these type the reason they die out they go through the purging of the trial of the tribulation because they're not actually under the blood that's right that's powerful they claim that they are but they're not how can they go through a trial to purify them when there is the bleach blood of Jesus Christ takes away every symptom and stuff away from you so if you're when you're fully when you're Justified God sees you as perfect what have you got to stand judgment for you're as perfect as Christ is he already took our judgment he's not going to be smitten again he took your judgment aren't you thankful he said and you're already dead and your life is hid in him through God and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost what are you going to be judged for where going to get your purification what do you have to be purified from when you're perfectly in Christ sinless but why do we why do we beat ourselves up sometimes over things is because the greatest battle ever fought that doesn't mean that it's God doing it that's the enemy that's when we have to take the word and say I'm Justified I'm perfect I'm sinless because he's going to judge the world remember you hear the prophet of God ring out all the time on tape he said if he's going to judge the World by something he's got to judge the World by a standard and that standard is Jesus Christ the word so that means that people will be judged according to their attitude toward the word because our attitude toward the word is our attitude toward Jesus Christ himself there's no difference I've got to hurry in St John 12:48 he said he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day now when Jesus came the first time he came as a lamb he submitted himself to death he you know he came because he had to fulfill that sacrificial part but the second time he's come he's coming as judge same one different office brother raham tells a story about a cowboy he said there was there was a little baby in like a Buckboard wagon like they used to have and he was asleep or he was in there or whatever and all of a sudden a gunshot went off and this horse and this Buckboard wagon started tearing off through the countryside and was getting ready to go right over a cliff and right before went over this this Cliff brother Timothy a cow a young cowboy rode next to that horse and he grabed that horse by the rain and stop and save that baby's life years later that boy found made some wrong decisions and he found himself on trial for killing a man and there was a judge on the bench and after all the evidence and everything was laid out that judge looked at the law what was require and he said I sentence you to hang by your neck until this Mortal body until this Mortal life leaves your body and that man threw himself down and he be to cry and to beg with the judge and said judge don't you know me he said don't you know me and the judge looked down at him and said son I don't believe I do he said years ago I was a baby and a gunshot went off and I was you know being being taken to my death With a speeding horse you came and you saved me save me judge save me and that judge looked down at him and said son he said that day I was your savior he said but today I'm your judge we want to get it right now because let me tell you on the day of judgment right now we know each other according to the flesh but on the day of judgment it won't be Lord he's a good buddy of mine we really we really hung out and and and he's a good buddy of mine will then take on the will then be in judgment with him and when we hold the token over our prodigals now it's not just because of natural Association it's you've got the Holy Ghost you have the token and we're instructed to hold the token over our loved ones and we commit them to the Lord and we plead for their mercy and we believe they're going to be there and that's what we should do and that's what we'll always do but what I'm trying to tell you is on the day of judgment there'll be no human Association in the sense of Lord I I I know he didn't respect your word but let's just let him in because he's a good buddy it's the word the books will be open and the world will be judged by on what their attitude was towards this word now in the book in in Antiquity there was a sign whenever a king and I'm trying to wind this down whenever a king would come in on a donkey it was a symbol of peace that's how he would signify he's not there for war he's there for peace but when a king showed up on a horse you better watch out and the prophecy in Isaiah 9:9 says Rejoice greatly oh Daughter of Zion shout oh daughter of Jerusalem Behold thy King cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation he's lowly riding upon an ass and upon the cult the fo of an ass same King coming in peace he came to be our savior but now if you'll pull up Revelations 1911 look at the difference same God but now he com comes as judge and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and see he's on a horse and he that sat on him was called faithful and true and in righteousness doth he judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his heads were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses that's the bride clothed in fine linen white and clean spotless Justified and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword not out of his mouth goeth father forgive them for they know not what they do it's now turned at this point it's turned from Mercy to judgment and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the wine press of the fierceness of Wrath of almighty God and on and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and Lord of lords who appeared in this end time who was that are y'all able to pull up the cloud picture from Arizona when he appeared out west I want for us to remember it was not taken by Believers Believers didn't rush and say oh that that's the face of Christ let let me let me let me go take a quick picture scientists did that in the Houston Coliseum who took the picture of the pillar of fire critics critics took it but he's appeared because he's come to call his bride if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin now when you keep reading the book of John and I'm I'm really trying to close but I don't want to leave you hanging here in John 1 John 1:8 I know I'm making you work up there I'm sorry it says if we say as you keep reading he says if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in US if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we've not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us and that's not a contradiction in the Bible because remember sin is unbelief and when people do wrong they're attributes of sin they do that because they disbelieve in their heart so we as Christians make mistakes and we have sins that we've got to ask God to forgive us that we cover that we get covered by the blood but you've got to keep reading because remember whenever Paul Justified Abraham by his faith and then you have James comes and justifies him by his works and it looks like a contradiction in the Bible but brother Ram says that Paul was describing what God was saying and James was describing what man was saying because faith is Works expressed so when you read in 1 John chapter 3 you have to keep reading it says ye and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin whosoever abideth in him sinth not whosoever sinth hath not seen him neither known him little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested said that he might destroy the works of the devil 1 John 3:9 whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin that's not a contradiction because look what the next sentence says for his seed remaineth in him whose seed God's seed and he cannot sin because he's born of God in 1 John 5:18 for we know that whosoever is born of God sinth not but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself and that Wicked one toucheth him not amen let's stand tonight oh the precious blood of Jesus that cleanses us from all sin as Christians we of course as long as as we're still in these bodies we're going to make mistakes absolutely but yet we're without sin the prophet of God said how can a man say that the bride of Christ goes into the tribulation I can't understand it see she is took away from the tribulation if the church has been judged and they have been judged themselves and have accepted the blood how can God judge Jud a man that's perfectly totally sinless you say there's no such a person every Born Again believer True Believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God you're sinless because the blood of Jesus Christ so cleanses us from sin her righteousness is his righteousness God has come in this end time Saints and he's proved himself beyond a shadow of a doubt there's no reason for this generation to disbelieve but they still did they still crucify the word didn't they Paul said oh foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you that you should not obeyed the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you couldn't we cry out again and say oh foolish Le oans who hath Bewitched you that ye should obey not the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ have been so evidently set crucified among you the Lord Jesus Christ is so merciful if y'all if y'all can't get that picture that's okay I think we all know what it looks like but he's appeared as a white wigged one and see to the world it's judgment but to you it's peace arise and shine thy light has come it's even in the back of the church arise and shine for thy light has come he's descended from heaven with a shout to call a bride an end time bride that hasn't been manhandled but a pure bride a virgin of his word the Lord Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever judgment to the world peace to you remember the spirit of God told Brother BR to pick up a rock and to throw it and that started a whirlwind and judgment began for this nation and for this world and it hasn't stopped since aren't you thankful to be a message believer aren't you thankful to be called out and to be completely Justified and to know that no matter how much Satan tries to bring up our past and bring up well no matter how much dirt he's ever thrown on our lives he couldn't stop us from being here you think about that no matter what family you came from and what anyone's everever done to you what you've ever done to anybody there's not nothing you could have ever done or anything that anyone could have ever done to you that the blood of Jesus Christ can't cleanse aren't you thankful for a blood like that amen let's bow our heads dear gracious Heavenly Father God we thank you Lord Jesus for these opportunity Lord to look into your word Lord how we love you with all of our hearts Lord and Lord we thank you Father for giving us an ear to hear this word thank you Lord Jesus for the blood of Jesus Christ that can take a man oh God or a woman and so cleanse us when Satan had so many plans for us and wanted to take us in so many different directions and even had us going in different directions but yet Mercy rewrote Our Lives the blood of Jesus came and caught us and turned us around Lord I just pray that you just help us oh God God as we see the day approaching and draw nearer to you I pray that you help us to be more like you Lord and help us to just examine ourselves Lord in the light of this word and to see where we fall short father God we still need the blood we need the blood every day Lord Jesus and father God lord if there's anyone here Lord that hasn't fully surrendered their life Lord by and come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord may you deal with them Father Lord if they've only Justified Lord may you encourage them to be Sanctified Lord if they've only been Sanctified Lord may you just lead them to the baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord we love you Lord Jesus we love you with all of our heart we commit Lord Jesus this evening into your hands and pray that you have your way Lord speak to our
