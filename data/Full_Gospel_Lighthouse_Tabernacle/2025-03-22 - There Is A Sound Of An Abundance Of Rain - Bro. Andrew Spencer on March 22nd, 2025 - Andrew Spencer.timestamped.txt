[44:35] evening God bless you buddy amen what a
[44:38] meeting we had last weekend there's not
[44:41] enough words we could say about that I I
[44:43] know it was just a two who a two-day
[44:45] meeting but my goodness it felt like it
[44:48] was so impactful in such a way the Lord
[44:50] just blessed us abundantly didn't he
[44:52] amen I'd like to just speak to you uh
[44:55] from these text here tonight from First
[44:58] Kings chap 18 and verse 41 something
[45:00] that the Lord just laid on my heart
[45:02] yesterday morning I just like to follow
[45:06] the inspiration of the Lord
[45:08] here and Elijah said unto Ahab get thee
[45:12] up and eat and drink for there is a
[45:16] sound of an abundance of rain so Ahab
[45:20] went up and eat to drink eat and to
[45:23] drink and Elijah went up to mount to the
[45:26] top of
[45:27] caramel and he cast himself down upon
[45:30] the Earth and he put his face between
[45:31] his knees and said to his servant go up
[45:35] now look toward the sea and he went up
[45:39] and looked and said there is nothing how
[45:43] many times have we looked for God and
[45:46] there's
[45:48] nothing and he said go again seven times
[45:52] now that word seven it sure means
[45:54] something to you and me don't it amen
[45:57] and it came to pass at the seventh age
[46:00] or seventh time that he said behold
[46:03] there ariseth a little Cloud out of the
[46:06] sea like a man's hand and he said go up
[46:09] and say unto Ahab prepare thy Chariot
[46:14] and get thee down that the rain stop
[46:16] thee not and it came to pass in the
[46:19] meanwhile that the heaven was black with
[46:22] clouds and wind and there was a great
[46:24] rain and Ahab rode and went went to
[46:27] jezel and the Hand of the Lord was on
[46:29] Elijah and he gted up his loins and ran
[46:33] before Ahab to the entrance of jezrael
[46:36] may God bless his word you may be seated
[46:39] tonight in the presence of the Lord from
[46:41] this this text tonight I'd like to just
[46:44] take a thought from from the scriptures
[46:46] here there is a sound of an abundance of
[46:49] rain a sound of an abundance of rain and
[46:51] when you begin to look at that word
[46:54] sound in the in the Hebrew you mind it's
[46:57] it's very simple that word sound means
[47:01] voice it means a voice and we realize
[47:04] that that we are living in an hour we
[47:06] realize that we've had a voice that has
[47:08] spoken unto us and it's not a it's not a
[47:11] it's not a voice that has that has
[47:13] dimmed Away by over 60 some years but we
[47:17] realize that that voice is ever
[47:19] prominent even right now and we realize
[47:21] that you and I you and I's words have
[47:24] much power in it that there there is
[47:26] there is some very very powerful things
[47:29] that come out of our lips but we realize
[47:31] but what the power of the sound that you
[47:34] and I are living in because we realize
[47:37] that words have power they have the
[47:39] ability to transform they have the
[47:41] ability to hurt they have the ability to
[47:44] bring about a healing in that in that
[47:47] way but we realize that in the very
[47:49] beginning you'll find that in the very
[47:51] first of the Bible you'll see that sound
[47:54] is mentioned right there in the Book of
[47:56] Genesis is when God said let there be
[47:58] light so we begin to see that God's
[48:00] spoken word as it comes as it comes into
[48:04] fruition we begin to see that that God
[48:06] begins to manifest the creation of sound
[48:09] and the prophet would teach us that that
[48:11] a word is a thought expressed and we
[48:14] realize that God had thoughts in his
[48:16] mind that all of a sudden he begin to
[48:19] express those thoughts and he begin to
[48:20] speak those things out and you begin to
[48:22] see what God had in his mind but for you
[48:25] and I in humanity we realize that there
[48:27] are a lot of thoughts that we just have
[48:29] in our mind and thank God that sometimes
[48:31] those thoughts are not expressed but
[48:34] there are a lot of times that there is
[48:36] that side of the carnal of humanity
[48:39] there are thoughts that are never
[48:40] expressed and they never become a word
[48:42] as you see as long as it's a thought it
[48:44] never becomes it never is expressed and
[48:47] there's no action that can form behind
[48:49] it but in our relationship to the
[48:51] almighty there's got to be some sound
[48:53] behind our relationship is that right if
[48:56] there's if there's never if there's
[48:57] never no sound behind a husband and wife
[49:00] relationship you'll find that you'll
[49:02] begin to see a coldness slip in but if
[49:04] there is some sound that is behind that
[49:07] relationship you'll find that there is a
[49:09] gratitude from the humanity to the
[49:12] almighty that sounds off gratitude it
[49:14] sounds off that he's greater than us you
[49:16] see you see the Bible tells us that he
[49:19] is the high priest of our profession he
[49:22] is the high priest of our confession so
[49:24] we realized that there's got to be some
[49:26] confession questions there's got to be
[49:27] some things that are revolving around
[49:29] our sound that are literally coming out
[49:31] of our lips that sometimes it it may not
[49:34] look like it's there it may not feel
[49:36] like it's there but you've got to sound
[49:37] off some things I was listening to a
[49:39] tape today and brother Brandon was
[49:41] talking about he said he said he had
[49:42] told me that if I ate one bite if I took
[49:45] one bite of certain things of a of a
[49:47] hard meal he said it would kill me right
[49:48] away he said but I just kept on
[49:50] confession and I kept on eating them
[49:52] beans and I I kept eating that cornbread
[49:54] he said I kept eating it he said he said
[49:56] he said people said I was lying he said
[49:58] no he said I was saying by the word that
[50:01] I was healed you see you see the sound
[50:03] that comes out of our mouth might seem a
[50:05] little bit strange to the world but to
[50:07] you and I as Believers we realize that
[50:10] our sound has got some victory behind it
[50:12] our sounds got some power behind it and
[50:15] we realize that all the way back there
[50:17] we begin to see that the blood that all
[50:19] things have a sound that the Bible said
[50:22] that the blood has a sound to it you
[50:25] remember when when when the Lord when
[50:27] Elohim is looking for for Cain after
[50:30] he's walking there he finds out that
[50:33] Cain that Cain is slew his his his
[50:35] brother Abel and the Bible said that the
[50:38] voice of thy brother's blood crith unto
[50:40] me from the ground so the we realize
[50:43] that the blood has a sound but Paul
[50:46] picks that up in Hebrews chap 12 and 24
[50:49] and it said unto Jesus the mediator of
[50:51] the New Covenant and to the blood of the
[50:53] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[50:55] than that of a it speaks better things
[50:58] can we say that together the blood
[51:00] speaks better things you say well what
[51:02] does that mean brother Andrew you see
[51:04] the blood of Abel was was cried out it
[51:07] cried out in Vengeance but the blood of
[51:10] Jesus Christ it has a sound of Mercy it
[51:13] has a sound of Pardon so there is a
[51:15] sound that comes with the blood and you
[51:18] and I we realize that brother Brandon
[51:20] would preach a preach a message and he
[51:22] would title it all things he said he
[51:24] said if I could he said I would preach a
[51:26] today on all things he said we realize
[51:29] that we can't preach all things he said
[51:31] so I'll just preach on this one thing
[51:33] I'll preach on a pardon so a pardon has
[51:36] a sound with it is that right but before
[51:39] a pardon can be received it's got to be
[51:42] accepted as a pardon before you can
[51:44] accept this message and the power that
[51:46] becomes this behind this message of
[51:48] Grace you've got to have put some sound
[51:50] to it come on somebody we're not just
[51:53] we're not just Devils here we're not
[51:55] just a bunch of people that that believe
[51:57] that he's God because the devil even
[51:59] believes that he's God there's a lot of
[52:01] Baptists that believe that he's God but
[52:03] you what makes the difference between
[52:05] you and I is that there's some sound on
[52:07] the other side of our
[52:12] belief we went up and we took the Rays
[52:15] last week and uh we took them up there
[52:17] or a couple weeks ago week and a half
[52:19] ago we took them up there to see the
[52:21] play Noah and and and many I I'm not
[52:24] going to give any too too much Det
[52:26] details cuz I realized that there's
[52:27] going to be some of you that will go but
[52:29] something that just that that that
[52:31] really labored in my heart was how that
[52:35] how that Noah and his family are on the
[52:38] inside of the Ark and they start hearing
[52:40] a sound for the very first time it had
[52:43] never been heard before but they hear
[52:45] this sound but on the other side of that
[52:48] sound was a voice a voice of saying let
[52:50] me get in there let me let me get in
[52:52] whatever I got to do let just open up
[52:54] the door let me get in there there was a
[52:56] sound there there was a sound there that
[52:58] Noah realized that he couldn't help them
[53:00] no more he had prepared an ark for them
[53:03] but now he's hearing this sound the
[53:05] sound of rain that was going to allow
[53:07] him to be able to go into Liberty and to
[53:10] take him across the Judgment but there
[53:12] was a
[53:14] sound there was a sound of voices that
[53:17] were that close to Noah that was his
[53:19] that was his friends that that he talked
[53:21] to and said let me in there what pushes
[53:25] you brother Andrew it's a it's the
[53:26] thought of hearing those sounds I don't
[53:29] want to be that obligated tunity to tell
[53:32] somebody about this sound I don't want
[53:35] to tell them about I don't want to miss
[53:36] an opportunity to get them on the inside
[53:39] of this Ark and Noah preached his
[53:41] message for 120 years and they couldn't
[53:44] accept the vision of it but it was a
[53:46] reality to him because it had the voice
[53:49] that was speaking to him had a sound of
[53:51] Heaven behind
[53:53] it there's a lot of people that don't
[53:55] even realize what has happened today
[53:57] they said they they said it was never
[53:59] going to happen to Noah and they said
[54:01] the same thing about an EG egg shaped
[54:03] car they said the seven they said the
[54:05] seventh thing they said the same thing
[54:06] about the seventh angel they said those
[54:08] things that they didn't realize that
[54:10] there was a reality behind that Vision
[54:12] come on somebody we're way past the egg
[54:14] shaped car we're way past women getting
[54:16] their rights to vote but we are living
[54:18] in the reality of a bride that has a
[54:21] sound behind her
[54:23] Voice Hallelujah
[54:28] I don't think we truly realize the
[54:31] importance of sound and how we use it
[54:33] every day but sound's very
[54:37] powerful the power of sound is in
[54:39] Creation The Sound I it is fundamental
[54:43] to life everything in nature produces a
[54:47] sound wind and water has a sound animals
[54:50] have a sound even your own human
[54:52] heartbeat has a sound and even
[54:54] scientists have discovered that they can
[54:56] use sound waves to can affect the matter
[55:00] and it proves its power by shaping its
[55:03] environment my sound sound is also in
[55:07] our communication and language a spoken
[55:10] language is our primary communication is
[55:13] that right but the way that we sound it
[55:15] off it can mean a lot of things you see
[55:19] you can say one thing and somebody
[55:21] receive it another way you see you have
[55:24] the ability by language and by different
[55:26] tones and pictures and volumes it can
[55:29] change the meaning of what we say I
[55:33] could say come
[55:35] here and it'll strike fear in your heart
[55:39] or I could say come here I want you to
[55:41] see this come here it it can cause an
[55:43] excitement or I could say it in the
[55:46] darkness Daddy come
[55:49] here you see it has the ability to to
[55:52] have different influences because of the
[55:55] way that you use use the sound are you
[55:58] with me sound is also used in Warfare in
[56:02] in battlecries and in trumpets and when
[56:04] when men are setting forth for for for
[56:06] armies and settling up their battle for
[56:08] Warfare even Joshua used and realized
[56:12] the power of sound of trumpets to begin
[56:14] to alarm that this was a time to release
[56:17] your sound today we we hear all kinds of
[56:20] sounds of of alarms and sirens and and
[56:23] emergency signals and even sound free
[56:26] frequencies that you and I wouldn't know
[56:28] but men in military they understand the
[56:31] technology and they use different forms
[56:33] of sound to be able to alert that
[56:36] there's an enemy at hand even we realize
[56:40] that science has tapped in to
[56:43] sound we use what we call sonar an
[56:47] echolocation it helps our submaro
[56:50] submarines and animals and bats be able
[56:52] to navigate at the night time or in the
[56:54] darkness of water we are thankful for
[56:57] good speakers and microphones and
[56:59] amplifiers here but they also use an
[57:02] instrument called an ultrasound that
[57:05] helps a doctor be able to use use that
[57:08] to be able to see on the inside of the
[57:10] body I had the opportunity to to have
[57:13] one of those just a couple weeks ago not
[57:15] because I was pregnant but because they
[57:17] was checking some things on the inside
[57:19] of me I told her I told that little lady
[57:21] that was doing that ultrasound I said
[57:22] you see a baby in there you go ahead and
[57:25] call you call the right
[57:27] people call my wife and call The
[57:33] Undertaker but all of a sudden while I'm
[57:36] having this done I I don't realiz I
[57:38] don't think that God allows us to go
[57:40] through anything without having a having
[57:42] a a double a compound meaning to it he
[57:45] he begins to allow us to just kind of
[57:47] tap in to be able to see what he's
[57:49] meaning but there that ultrasound it is
[57:52] built and it's built in such a way that
[57:55] they they use it that it has this
[57:57] tranducer that it uses these high
[57:59] frequencies that are Way Beyond what the
[58:02] human's ability is to be able to hear
[58:04] and they take it and they place it on
[58:06] maybe maybe a a pregnant mother and they
[58:09] place it there and they can look and
[58:10] they use they use the Echoes of how many
[58:13] times that it bounces off and they use
[58:16] these Wes sister Julie is a ultrasound
[58:18] technician and could definitely give a
[58:20] whole lot better in illustration than
[58:22] what I can but because of the sound that
[58:24] is there it produces an image so that
[58:27] you can see right into the body I want
[58:29] to say this that this voice in this age
[58:32] has given us an ability to be able to
[58:34] look on the inside of a
[58:37] body I I remember going there with with
[58:40] Katie and looking at the ultrasounds and
[58:42] different things as as a mother I always
[58:45] you know you ever had one you get that
[58:46] they squeeze that jail on you know
[58:49] that's that jail scars the fire out of
[58:51] me cuz you know good and well it's cold
[58:52] as as a
[58:54] Dickens but thank God when this woman
[58:57] sprayed sprayed that gel on me it she
[58:59] had the she had the fortitude to warm
[59:01] that gel and I I tell you what that's a
[59:04] blessing right there you was getting
[59:06] ready to take my breath I said what in
[59:08] the world is that jail even used for and
[59:12] she said without that jail we can't see
[59:15] in your body I said wait a minute wait a
[59:18] minute you mean to tell me without that
[59:20] barrier there you can't see into my body
[59:24] you see there's got to be a barrier
[59:26] barer between you and the sound and if
[59:28] you're not hearing this message cor
[59:31] correct it'll depend where what kind of
[59:33] barrier is standing between you and the
[59:36] sound you see the Bible says in Romans
[59:38] 10:1 17 that Faith cometh by hearing and
[59:41] hearing by the word of God so we realize
[59:44] it depends how you're hearing the sound
[59:47] you see there's got to be something that
[59:49] is standing between you a barrier
[59:52] between you and that sound that's the
[59:55] reason why a lot of people hear this
[59:57] message and they said well he called me
[59:58] a buzzard but because they had that kind
[1:00:01] of unbelief barrier they heard a buzzard
[1:00:04] but because you had a faith barrier you
[1:00:07] hear that you're an
[1:00:08] eagle you see this sound has given you
[1:00:12] the ability to be able to look past what
[1:00:15] you see and think past what you can see
[1:00:19] and
[1:00:21] feel brother bandham would would deal
[1:00:25] over and over over again with with deaf
[1:00:27] people you can hear brother brandom and
[1:00:30] I just I just picked this this one
[1:00:32] instance up brother brand in the message
[1:00:34] love and Saskatoon he said he said that
[1:00:36] little girl that little de mut he said I
[1:00:38] don't I don't say that she'll receive
[1:00:40] her conditions here he said now are you
[1:00:42] her father are you a Christian he said
[1:00:45] you believe that he'll do it you do does
[1:00:48] the audience believe that this little
[1:00:49] mute will be healed he said now remember
[1:00:51] I'm not asking God for miracles no but
[1:00:54] if he desires to do them all right
[1:00:56] he will come into this audience and take
[1:00:58] and do the things that he's done he said
[1:01:01] that's a miracle enough to convince that
[1:01:04] he's here don't you believe it he said
[1:01:05] but the reason that I'm asking these
[1:01:07] things is this this little child right
[1:01:09] here he said they're too little to have
[1:01:12] faith for themselves he said but if they
[1:01:14] can just say one little word you see if
[1:01:17] you can just say one little word you may
[1:01:20] not have the faith of brother R you may
[1:01:22] not have the faith of brother brother
[1:01:24] William but if you can just say say one
[1:01:26] little word like Hattie said that's
[1:01:29] nothing but the truth it wasn't a great
[1:01:30] big paragraph she just simply put
[1:01:33] herself in harmony with what a prophet
[1:01:35] said you see if they can just say one
[1:01:38] little word he said when Elijah sent up
[1:01:40] gahaz up there to take a look at the
[1:01:42] cloud he said I seen one about the size
[1:01:45] of a hand of a man he said I hear the
[1:01:47] sound of an abundance of rain you see
[1:01:50] you don't see it yet but you hear
[1:01:54] it come on somebody had he spoke it and
[1:01:57] the things wasn't there yet but she was
[1:01:59] going to see it because she heard it
[1:02:04] come on somebody if squirrels could
[1:02:05] produce prodical to give their heart
[1:02:07] back to God what
[1:02:10] about what about Jim Noel what about
[1:02:13] Dylan shiffley what about Tom Hill what
[1:02:16] about Denny Vance one little
[1:02:18] word one little woman of
[1:02:21] [Applause]
[1:02:24] faith I hear the sound of the abundance
[1:02:27] of rain he said now if God will just
[1:02:30] give this little girl and he stops and
[1:02:34] said I noticed that Death woman out
[1:02:36] there nodding her head to me ain't it
[1:02:40] powerful if they could just hear one
[1:02:41] little hurt and he doesn't talk about
[1:02:44] one getting the rain but he talks about
[1:02:46] the abundance of rain and all of a
[1:02:49] sudden when he speaks that thing there's
[1:02:51] a death Spirit right here at the
[1:02:53] platform but there's a death Spirit back
[1:02:55] there
[1:02:56] he said I see that little Death woman
[1:02:58] back there nodding her head to me can
[1:03:00] you hear me all right sister if you are
[1:03:03] wave your hand well I may not have heard
[1:03:06] the message throughout the first time
[1:03:09] but there was a prophet that stood there
[1:03:11] and broke the spirit off of my life and
[1:03:14] now I can
[1:03:17] hear come on somebody I ain't hearing
[1:03:19] this through the devil's language I
[1:03:21] ain't hearing this through Lea's
[1:03:23] language I'm hearing this through the
[1:03:25] Sound Of Heaven the power of Heaven is
[1:03:29] behind this message and if you will
[1:03:31] allow
[1:03:33] it now what did Brother Bram do you
[1:03:35] watch him he goes in there he said now
[1:03:38] what it is he said it's a spirit that's
[1:03:40] on this little bitty girl he said but if
[1:03:43] he said it's kind of like a little band
[1:03:45] that's wrapped around those those nerves
[1:03:47] in there he said he said now it wasn't
[1:03:50] nothing that she would do or this one
[1:03:52] would do he said it's a spirit that's
[1:03:54] there
[1:03:56] and brother bham goes in there he said
[1:03:59] if I can break the spirit then you'll be
[1:04:02] able to hear and all of a sudden you
[1:04:04] hear a prophet calling out and calling
[1:04:07] Satan said you're nothing but a bluff I
[1:04:09] break that Spirit In The Name of Jesus
[1:04:11] Christ and all of a sudden those nerves
[1:04:14] that had been blocked up where she
[1:04:16] couldn't hear that that sound she
[1:04:18] couldn't hear her daddy say I love you
[1:04:20] she couldn't hear her mama say go fix
[1:04:22] this or go do that but all of a sudden
[1:04:25] because the spirit was broken she could
[1:04:27] hear a sound I'm so thankful that this
[1:04:30] voice got a hold of me but for the
[1:04:33] spirit of the world got a hold of me so
[1:04:35] now I'm not listening through a filter
[1:04:37] of man's ideas but I'm hearing it
[1:04:39] through a thinking man's filter Christ
[1:04:41] Jesus and it builds Supernatural
[1:04:47] powerhouses I tell you what I don't care
[1:04:51] who you are I don't care how far you are
[1:04:53] away from this message your identity is
[1:04:56] greater than that spirit I don't care
[1:04:58] what kind of influence that you're under
[1:05:00] I don't care what kind of creed that
[1:05:01] you're under your identity as a gene
[1:05:03] seed of God is greater than the spirit
[1:05:05] of hell that would try to hold you back
[1:05:07] from this message and all the blessings
[1:05:09] that are poured
[1:05:13] out I say your
[1:05:15] identity has the ability to break that
[1:05:22] Spirit there's also a spiritual power
[1:05:26] to sound you begin to read in Exodus
[1:05:29] chapter 28 is one of my favorite things
[1:05:31] to study Brother Jay is about the about
[1:05:35] the high priest going into the temple
[1:05:37] there in the
[1:05:38] wilderness and it tells us that the high
[1:05:42] priest had to have a sound he was
[1:05:44] dressed right he had he had the robes on
[1:05:46] and everything all the blue and Scarlets
[1:05:48] and all the things perfectly in
[1:05:51] place but you see there on the bottom of
[1:05:55] his robe was golden bells and
[1:05:58] pomegranates of of of a certain color of
[1:06:00] blue and when they would bounce back and
[1:06:03] forth these were not just noise they may
[1:06:06] have been a noise to a lot of people but
[1:06:08] this was not just a noise to almighty
[1:06:10] God this noise that some people heard
[1:06:14] was just gibberish but to almighty God
[1:06:17] the sound that was coming off of that
[1:06:18] Bell and that pomegranate was holy holy
[1:06:22] holy there's a lot of people that don't
[1:06:24] understand why you quote quote quote
[1:06:26] quote quote but unto almighty God it
[1:06:29] screams holy holy holy unto the Lord
[1:06:32] Almighty you see the major difference
[1:06:35] between that sound and no sound was when
[1:06:37] there was no sound in the temple then it
[1:06:40] showed that the priest had died in the
[1:06:42] presence of God but as long as there was
[1:06:44] some sound in the
[1:06:47] Tabernacle come on somebody as long as
[1:06:49] there was some sound in that
[1:06:51] Tabernacle you proved that there was
[1:06:54] life in that Tabernacle
[1:06:56] that's why God cannot have no quiet
[1:06:59] [Music]
[1:07:00] [Applause]
[1:07:02] Church it matters what sound that you're
[1:07:07] hearing because Jesus said my sheep hear
[1:07:11] my
[1:07:15] sound
[1:07:17] we we always keep something and I got a
[1:07:21] little TV in my garage monitor for those
[1:07:24] of you
[1:07:28] it's a TV I don't care but we always
[1:07:31] keep instrumental music because I
[1:07:33] realize the power of music there we
[1:07:35] always keep some music that's going on
[1:07:37] that thing maybe some art and some
[1:07:39] different things and and we listen to
[1:07:41] those those sounds and I we just keep it
[1:07:44] going all the time the girls turn it on
[1:07:46] they play it and they realizes that
[1:07:47] music creates an atmosphere and I had
[1:07:50] brother Michael and Sister Abigail there
[1:07:51] in my there in my garage and we were
[1:07:54] just walking in and all of a sudden I
[1:07:56] walk in there and on the TV it done it
[1:07:57] didn't change off of this art and this
[1:07:59] instrumental music and it was just like
[1:08:01] this humming noise and all it was odd
[1:08:04] because it was like a black screen and
[1:08:07] then there was these bowls that was lit
[1:08:08] up a and out of out of that screen was
[1:08:12] his hand and I was like man what in the
[1:08:15] world you know if you just leave
[1:08:17] something on it it just keep replaying I
[1:08:18] thought man the world it's here I am
[1:08:20] trying to do something right and got a
[1:08:22] preacher one of my best friendss staying
[1:08:23] up in my garage and I got Voodoo playing
[1:08:25] out
[1:08:29] here and I was like man I'm sorry I I I
[1:08:32] I don't know how that happened and all
[1:08:34] of a sudden brother Michael said now
[1:08:36] wait a minute wait a minute he said
[1:08:37] that's not maybe what you think it is he
[1:08:39] said I he said what it is he said there
[1:08:40] have been studies that are done on the
[1:08:43] elements of healing with sound that all
[1:08:46] of those they begin to take this little
[1:08:48] rod and they roll it around them bowls
[1:08:50] and it it produces certain frequencies
[1:08:53] that produce healing in the body now
[1:08:55] I'll just say it like this if it had not
[1:08:57] been for that sound I would have cut off
[1:09:00] this
[1:09:02] sound I'd have cut that thing off
[1:09:04] because I didn't understand what that
[1:09:06] sound was about you see if it had not
[1:09:09] been for some gospel preachers I may not
[1:09:11] have heard the sound that was there for
[1:09:13] my healing that was there for my peace
[1:09:16] that was there to drive away fear but
[1:09:18] because there was a sound that said you
[1:09:20] need to listen to this thank God for
[1:09:22] some mamas and daddies that say children
[1:09:25] stay right here in this
[1:09:29] sound I thank God for mamas and daddies
[1:09:32] that still believe and applying the
[1:09:34] token I thank God for mamies and daddies
[1:09:36] that keep their children in the
[1:09:38] atmosphere of the Holy
[1:09:45] sound you know we've never been
[1:09:48] surrounded by sound as much as we are
[1:09:53] today just reading over a
[1:09:56] study the this study that was produced
[1:09:59] in
[1:10:00] 2021 it it said that Beyond positive and
[1:10:04] uplifting sounds of singing and music
[1:10:06] there is also noise pollution which
[1:10:09] researchers say is one of the leading
[1:10:11] causes of health issues worldwide and in
[1:10:14] this study had estimated that people
[1:10:15] living close to busy roads were more
[1:10:17] likely to have high experience High
[1:10:20] cortisol the stress hormone levels than
[1:10:23] to have and to have hypertens ion and
[1:10:26] heart disease and up to 40 million
[1:10:28] people in the US suffer from hearing
[1:10:30] impairment due to excessive noise
[1:10:33] exposure they said it doesn't have to be
[1:10:35] a loud or disturbing noise that affects
[1:10:38] us however he said they they study said
[1:10:42] the Bing and beep of notifications can
[1:10:46] also increase our stress
[1:10:49] levels when our phones or our computers
[1:10:52] make a sound to notify us of a message I
[1:10:55] brains might re release dopamine the
[1:10:58] motivation and desire hormone but they
[1:11:01] can also release cortisol which in
[1:11:04] excess is a detrimental to our health so
[1:11:07] it matters what kind of
[1:11:10] sound you see if it's if it I'll just be
[1:11:14] I just say like this if I text you it
[1:11:16] can create it can create fear and it can
[1:11:19] create
[1:11:21] happiness depending on who's receiving
[1:11:23] it
[1:11:25] why ain't you been in
[1:11:27] church probably going to release some
[1:11:32] cortisol I seen you down there enjoying
[1:11:35] the presence of the Lord it's probably
[1:11:36] going to release some
[1:11:38] dopamine it depends on how you
[1:11:44] beeping now let me let me preach I've
[1:11:47] been I I've been laboring real real hard
[1:11:50] right here and hope I ain't lost you too
[1:11:51] much but let me preach just for a minute
[1:11:54] the prophet said said the voice of God
[1:11:56] is a rare thing today he said it's
[1:11:58] smothered out by so many different
[1:11:59] voices so many things that Dem and take
[1:12:01] away he said if other voices are
[1:12:03] contrary to the voice of God then it
[1:12:05] must be the voice of our enemy to go in
[1:12:07] there and confuse us that we would not
[1:12:09] understand the voice of God when it
[1:12:11] spoke he said there's so many voices in
[1:12:13] the Earth today that it's absolutely a
[1:12:15] hard thing because it deadens the voice
[1:12:18] of the supernatural there is so many
[1:12:20] intellectual voices and great voices of
[1:12:22] mighty men who are intellectual that in
[1:12:25] their intellectual conditions even shake
[1:12:27] the
[1:12:28] nation it's powerful it's powerful that
[1:12:32] it deadens a supernatural it causes the
[1:12:35] voice of God actually to be placed off
[1:12:38] somewhere so for you and I in a in a
[1:12:41] world filled with noise it is important
[1:12:45] that we be intentional and conscious
[1:12:48] about the sounds that are surrounding
[1:12:51] us I say it's important I say it's
[1:12:54] important who's sounding off around you
[1:12:57] you let negativity constantly be I'll
[1:12:59] tell you what you let somebody be
[1:13:01] negative all their life they're negative
[1:13:03] about the stock market they're negative
[1:13:05] about their taxes they're negative about
[1:13:07] their flat tire they're negative about
[1:13:09] their husband and before long you'll get
[1:13:11] under the influence of that
[1:13:13] negativity it matters what sound that
[1:13:16] you're under but if you can get around
[1:13:18] somebody in the positive side it'll be
[1:13:21] complete
[1:13:22] opposite now how much greater in the
[1:13:25] spiritual is that if you get around
[1:13:27] somebody that's full of unbelief that
[1:13:29] don't believe in the moving of the
[1:13:30] spirit that doesn't believe that God
[1:13:32] sent a prophet it'll bring you down but
[1:13:34] if you can get around Hallelujah if you
[1:13:36] can get around some Eagles get around
[1:13:39] some Eagles and you can start flying to
[1:13:41] another level it'll take you to another
[1:13:44] spot it matters what kind of sound
[1:13:46] you're listening to I tell you what I
[1:13:49] tell you the world's got full of chicken
[1:13:50] sounds but I'm so far in the heavens I
[1:13:53] don't even hear the chicken no
[1:14:00] more that's why the message should never
[1:14:04] be background noise it should be our
[1:14:06] foreground noise come on somebody
[1:14:09] there's power in this seventh angel
[1:14:11] sound because it brings healing it
[1:14:13] relieves stress it relieves nervous
[1:14:16] tension upon your
[1:14:18] life it matters what kind of sound
[1:14:20] you're listening
[1:14:23] to music
[1:14:25] has a powerful
[1:14:28] sound music has the ability to go in and
[1:14:32] slip in and create deep emotional and
[1:14:36] spiritual
[1:14:38] impacts sound of praise and worship is
[1:14:41] built so that you can glorify almighty
[1:14:45] God and we use sound to create an
[1:14:50] atmosphere you see it matters it matters
[1:14:53] what kind of sound you're listening to
[1:14:57] you see if if if a minister is preaching
[1:15:00] you got to have the right kind of a
[1:15:01] sound to go after the preaching of the
[1:15:03] word to make sure that the rainfalls to
[1:15:06] sew the seed that had been just been
[1:15:08] sewn you see if you're trying to create
[1:15:11] an atmosphere for a an altar call you
[1:15:14] would begin to speak out and you begin
[1:15:16] to sing I feel the pool or you begin to
[1:15:19] play Nearer My God to thee or or or just
[1:15:22] as I am and you start playing those
[1:15:24] songs that that creates an inviting
[1:15:26] inviting atmosphere and it's all done by
[1:15:29] sound there's healing power in this
[1:15:32] sound but the prophet said now if you're
[1:15:34] wanting to create an atmosphere for a
[1:15:36] dance he said you don't play near my God
[1:15:39] to thee but you'll play that song I'm
[1:15:42] one of them or there's going to be a
[1:15:44] meeting in the air you see it depends on
[1:15:48] what kind of an atmosphere that you're
[1:15:50] trying to produce it matters what
[1:15:52] sound's coming out
[1:15:56] to be honest if the preaching of the
[1:15:57] word Goes Forth and all of a sudden it's
[1:16:00] time for an Altra call and you can feel
[1:16:02] the net has drawn been thrown out across
[1:16:04] a congregation and you can feel the
[1:16:06] spirit begin to move and all of a sudden
[1:16:08] there could be a a sound there could be
[1:16:10] a guy that's on the sound or or over top
[1:16:12] of the music or over top of the singing
[1:16:14] and all of a sudden all of a sudden he
[1:16:17] just starts singing there's going to be
[1:16:18] a meeting in the air it can break the
[1:16:22] atmosphere it matters that you have
[1:16:25] somebody that is in tune with
[1:16:28] sound but it also matters that there's
[1:16:31] somebody in tune with the spirit that
[1:16:34] captures where the spirit of God is
[1:16:36] going that's why I I absolutely love
[1:16:39] good worship worship leaders we're not
[1:16:41] song leaders around here we're worship
[1:16:43] leaders around here but it creates an
[1:16:46] atmosphere where God can hear our
[1:16:49] sound you know brother Ram said about
[1:16:52] David that David was a Divine healer by
[1:16:54] music music because there was there was
[1:16:57] no no way that was the only way to cast
[1:17:00] out Devils was by playing the healing
[1:17:03] words that the Lord is my shepherd and
[1:17:06] he played that over top of Saul with
[1:17:08] those evil spirits and those evil
[1:17:10] spirits heard that
[1:17:12] sound there's a lot of people that can
[1:17:14] play music it mattered what David was
[1:17:17] playing across it he wasn't playing he
[1:17:21] wasn't playing there ain't nothing but a
[1:17:23] hound dog he was was playing the Lord is
[1:17:26] my
[1:17:30] shepherd and that evil spirit brother
[1:17:32] Bram said it it Disturbed that evil
[1:17:35] spirit and it drove him away so brother
[1:17:39] brandham said that music has the ability
[1:17:42] to cast out Devils he said shame on you
[1:17:46] people that don't believe in string
[1:17:48] music he said no wonder evil spirits
[1:17:50] never like it he said they have to get
[1:17:52] away from it because David cast out
[1:17:55] Devils by playing on a string
[1:18:01] instrument I'll be honest I don't want
[1:18:03] any musician up here that don't feel
[1:18:05] what they're
[1:18:06] doing I'll just be honest I don't want a
[1:18:08] man up here singing that doesn't feel
[1:18:10] what he's doing I had a great friend of
[1:18:13] mine a sound tech he told me he told me
[1:18:15] like this he said sound is no good until
[1:18:18] you can feel
[1:18:19] it and for a preacher I sure enjoy
[1:18:23] statements like that
[1:18:26] cuz it ain't no good until you can feel
[1:18:27] it if you've ever been on this side of
[1:18:30] it a lot of people don't understand why
[1:18:31] a preachers got to hear a lot of people
[1:18:34] don't understand why a singers got to
[1:18:35] hear himself they got to feel it they
[1:18:37] got to hear it they got to feel it you
[1:18:40] see there's something powerful about
[1:18:42] sound when you begin to feel it you see
[1:18:45] when you can begin to shake the very
[1:18:48] foundations of hell with your praise you
[1:18:51] see let me say it like this that the
[1:18:53] message is more than just a sound but
[1:18:56] it's an impact it has a feeling to it
[1:18:59] it's more than just feeling but there is
[1:19:01] a sound behind it that creates a
[1:19:04] feeling I'll say I'll say this kind of
[1:19:06] message that we're preaching has got so
[1:19:08] much power that you can feel
[1:19:11] it we we had some I ain't going to call
[1:19:14] what they were but we had some guys that
[1:19:15] was working on our on our property one
[1:19:17] time he was building us a barn and
[1:19:19] they's up there working that if you ever
[1:19:21] been up there where we live at we got
[1:19:23] that great big old power line it runs
[1:19:25] right through the middle of that thing I
[1:19:26] mean ginormous it's it's big you get
[1:19:29] underneath that thing in the middle of
[1:19:30] the
[1:19:31] rain you can hear that thing popping up
[1:19:33] there and hear he that rain hitting that
[1:19:35] hitting that power up there it starts
[1:19:37] sizzling these guys up there they had
[1:19:40] been around power like that before and
[1:19:42] they got up there and they they reaching
[1:19:44] over that sheet metal and they they was
[1:19:46] getting lit up brother
[1:19:47] Jim they hadn't been used to that kind
[1:19:49] of
[1:19:50] power and so they up there and they said
[1:19:53] we don't know what that's like what is
[1:19:54] that we said well what you're feeling is
[1:19:56] the power off them lines and there's a
[1:19:59] little bit of moisture up there on That
[1:20:01] Metal that you are and every time they
[1:20:02] was touching it they got shocked and
[1:20:05] that's the way a lot of people they've
[1:20:06] been around some water down gospel and
[1:20:09] when they get around a little
[1:20:14] power are you with me there's going to
[1:20:17] be some vibrations there going to be
[1:20:18] some impact of this sound I tell you
[1:20:21] they they got these things I I think
[1:20:23] it's a beautiful thing they call them
[1:20:25] Jawbone earbuds y'all ever y'all ever
[1:20:27] know what I'm talking about I know these
[1:20:28] kids do but they don't go in your ears
[1:20:31] but they literally sit right over top of
[1:20:33] you and they literally transfer the
[1:20:35] sound into your
[1:20:37] Jawbone ain't that crazy it ain't no
[1:20:41] it's sitting right there in your Jawbone
[1:20:43] but because of the vibrations you can
[1:20:45] hear it in your ear canal you know there
[1:20:49] was a composer before he was 20 years
[1:20:51] old he was one of the greatest composer
[1:20:53] that completely went death and he he
[1:20:56] lost all Hearing in his left eye he
[1:20:59] heard he lost all hearing and he and he
[1:21:01] couldn't and some of his best
[1:21:03] compulsions was after he had been death
[1:21:06] so what they said is what what a uh
[1:21:10] beten would do is he would take this
[1:21:12] stick and he place it in his mouth and
[1:21:14] he put it up there against the piano and
[1:21:16] he would play it and he would feel the
[1:21:18] vibrations from that stick and the music
[1:21:21] that he was playing and it was vibrating
[1:21:23] into his ear connect now and he was
[1:21:25] being able to produce some of the
[1:21:27] greatest music even when he couldn't do
[1:21:30] that he would lay on the floor and he
[1:21:33] would feel the vibrations of it I say
[1:21:35] this message is powerful enough to hear
[1:21:39] and to
[1:21:41] feel well you say well you don't know
[1:21:43] what you're talking about brother Andrew
[1:21:44] I absolutely do know what I'm talking
[1:21:45] about because I realize that with the
[1:21:47] more we sound off this message the more
[1:21:50] scared hell gets
[1:21:53] [Applause]
[1:21:54] well I'm going to need some examples
[1:21:56] brother Andrew a prophet in his first
[1:21:58] poll is standing there with patience he
[1:22:01] doesn't he doesn't have he's not giving
[1:22:04] the he's not giv a second sign at the
[1:22:06] time but he takes the patience by his
[1:22:08] left hand and the Lord gives him a sign
[1:22:10] and he's able to tell by the vibrations
[1:22:13] on his hands what kind of disease and
[1:22:16] what kind of spirit he said now I do not
[1:22:19] have the ability to heal you all I have
[1:22:21] the ability to do is tell you what
[1:22:24] disease that you have he said but if
[1:22:27] almighty God wants to heal you it's him
[1:22:29] that heals you if it's almighty God that
[1:22:32] wants to stop those vibrations it'll be
[1:22:34] God that stops the vibrations he said
[1:22:36] it's not me and he would deal with
[1:22:39] patience he said now you've got this
[1:22:41] you've got cancer in your lung ain't
[1:22:43] that right I can see it by the
[1:22:45] vibrations on my hand and all of a
[1:22:48] sudden he said now bow your head and be
[1:22:50] real reverent and every time brother
[1:22:52] brandom is dealing with an epileptic
[1:22:53] demon he asked people to be super
[1:22:55] reverent he said that's that one demon
[1:22:57] that always gets away from me it pays to
[1:23:00] be reverent in the presence of God and
[1:23:03] all of a sudden he says I can see that
[1:23:06] the vibrations have stopped what does
[1:23:08] that mean brother Andrew it means that
[1:23:10] spirit that was upon that life had lost
[1:23:13] its
[1:23:15] sound it lost its sound that it has no
[1:23:18] more voice to be able to say you're
[1:23:20] going to die with this you're going to
[1:23:22] go to an early grave with this that
[1:23:24] sound
[1:23:25] that devil lost its
[1:23:28] sound Hallelujah let me go on now God
[1:23:32] never speaks a word unless he's got a
[1:23:34] reason for speaking that word he's not
[1:23:36] like you and I that we just especially
[1:23:38] myself that speak so many foolish things
[1:23:40] God speaks every word with a meaning
[1:23:43] something that he's trying to achieve
[1:23:44] and we achieve by his word sound there's
[1:23:48] a voice behind it just like in the
[1:23:51] Garden of Eden or just like in the
[1:23:53] beginning you can look at every every
[1:23:54] example where there is sound out and you
[1:23:56] begin to watch how that sound separates
[1:23:59] Darkness from light and light from
[1:24:01] Darkness there is a sound that has the
[1:24:04] ability to break the power of
[1:24:07] Darkness if it went out of his mouth
[1:24:10] then it's got to be manifested is that
[1:24:13] right if there's going to be a bride
[1:24:14] that's going to be spotless then it's
[1:24:16] got to be manifested so there's got to
[1:24:18] be some evening light that breaks the
[1:24:22] darkness that's why when Jesus is
[1:24:24] standing there with Nicodemus he begins
[1:24:26] to tell him he said Marvel not that I
[1:24:28] say unto you except you be born that you
[1:24:30] must be born again he goes on to say the
[1:24:33] wind bloweth where it listeth and now
[1:24:35] Hearth a sound thereof but you can't
[1:24:37] tell where it come from and whether it
[1:24:39] goeth he said so is everyone that is
[1:24:42] born of the spirit so there is a sound
[1:24:46] behind the
[1:24:48] spirit and brother Gabriel knows brother
[1:24:51] Gabriel knows that if he's got a good
[1:24:53] witness lined up
[1:24:55] he better be a sound
[1:24:59] witness and he better have some sound
[1:25:01] with him because if he doesn't if he's
[1:25:05] willing to say something in front of
[1:25:06] somebody but he's not willing to say it
[1:25:08] in front of a judge his sound has no
[1:25:11] power is that right you see there's a
[1:25:14] lot of people that have the ability to
[1:25:15] say things maybe in an altar but they're
[1:25:17] not afraid they're afraid to say it in
[1:25:18] front of the public or in front of the
[1:25:20] enemy when he comes in like a flood
[1:25:22] again you see it matters you you see
[1:25:24] there is a sound behind the spirit and
[1:25:27] that's when Jesus when he's getting
[1:25:28] ready to be taken up at his Ascension he
[1:25:31] said go into Judea and they receive
[1:25:34] power you shall receive power and you
[1:25:36] shall be Witnesses unto me there's going
[1:25:39] to be some power that comes behind this
[1:25:42] witness that it's not going to be Peter
[1:25:45] and it's not going to be Mary but
[1:25:46] they're going to be under the
[1:25:48] Fulfillment of what Jesus done in John
[1:25:50] chapter 20 that he breathed on them and
[1:25:53] said receive you the Holy Ghost now to
[1:25:56] them it was just sound and they didn't
[1:25:58] understand it but when they were up
[1:26:00] there on the day of Pentecost and the
[1:26:03] Bible said that all of a sudden there
[1:26:05] was a sound a sound from Heaven Like A
[1:26:08] rushan Mighty Wind the voice of Heaven
[1:26:12] has a sound behind
[1:26:15] it Hallelujah you say well what are you
[1:26:18] saying I'm saying it puts perfectly in
[1:26:21] line what the prophet taught us on
[1:26:23] hearing receiving recognizing and acting
[1:26:26] on the word of God we say well what was
[1:26:28] what was Peter up there doing he was
[1:26:30] holding on to it he heard it with his
[1:26:32] ears he recognized it come from God and
[1:26:35] he acted on it we said what are you
[1:26:37] talking about I'm saying they're doing
[1:26:39] exactly what Paul did and they were
[1:26:41] holding on to some sound
[1:26:44] Doctrine they were holding on to a form
[1:26:47] of sound Doctrine and anything that
[1:26:49] ain't sound it's unsound and it's weak
[1:26:52] and it's unstable and it's dangerous
[1:26:55] but if you can get on the right side of
[1:26:56] the sound then it's strong then it's
[1:27:00] powerful then it's
[1:27:02] stable you see that's why so many people
[1:27:04] in Le Osa have a problem overcoming the
[1:27:07] Le osia age and the Antichrist spirit in
[1:27:09] this hour is because they're not trained
[1:27:11] to a sound but you and I we're not we're
[1:27:14] not hearing an uncertain sound but we
[1:27:16] are certain of almighty God and we've
[1:27:18] heard this sound and we've heard some
[1:27:20] sound Doctrine we're trained to a
[1:27:24] message and it's got a sound that sounds
[1:27:27] like we're going out of here it sounds
[1:27:30] like we're going to win the battle it
[1:27:32] sounds like cancer can't win it sounds
[1:27:34] like tuberculosis ain't enough it sounds
[1:27:37] like sin can't
[1:27:38] win this prophet's message has got some
[1:27:42] sound to it what is sound it's a voice
[1:27:46] and in the last
[1:27:49] days and in the last days there will be
[1:27:52] a voice in this generation what about
[1:27:54] the hour that you're living in what
[1:27:56] voice have you been
[1:27:58] under you ain't under the sound of Billy
[1:28:00] Graham you're not under the sound of old
[1:28:02] Roberts you're under the sound of the
[1:28:04] seventh angel you're under a sound
[1:28:06] that'll produce a body change you're
[1:28:08] under a
[1:28:13] sound I want you to eat this
[1:28:16] quote in the voice of God in the last
[1:28:18] days the prophet said the voice of God
[1:28:21] he said how will will we know it's the
[1:28:25] voice of God because for today then it
[1:28:27] was in he said then it was in a
[1:28:30] Vindicated Prophet but now
[1:28:32] today how we know it's the voice of God
[1:28:36] it's because of the
[1:28:38] manifestation of the prophet's
[1:28:41] word it's because of the manifestation
[1:28:44] of the prophet's word this is God's
[1:28:48] prophet and a true voice of God only
[1:28:51] brings back that real living
[1:28:53] Supernatural god with a supernatural
[1:28:55] word with a supern supernatural
[1:28:58] manifestation of the true word that we
[1:29:00] know it's the voice of
[1:29:14] God
[1:29:16] sound it's
[1:29:19] silent silence scares a lot of people
[1:29:25] but silence does not scare
[1:29:28] God Even Silence is a
[1:29:32] sound but silence is
[1:29:38] over because it's no longer in a
[1:29:41] prophet's mouth it's now a supernatural
[1:29:44] manifested voice of almighty God you see
[1:29:48] that's what scares
[1:29:50] Satan is you have become the manifested
[1:29:55] town let me let me say it like this that
[1:29:58] the the greater the obstacles and the
[1:30:01] greater the trial the greater the
[1:30:04] victory the greater the the greater that
[1:30:07] Satan is fighting you the greater there
[1:30:09] is a Triumph that is in front of you
[1:30:12] when you look at job's life and all that
[1:30:14] he went through how he lost his children
[1:30:16] how he lost his cattle how he lost his
[1:30:18] business then God poured blessings on
[1:30:22] top of blessings on top of blessings on
[1:30:25] top of blessings but when job goes back
[1:30:27] to talking to God he does not talk to
[1:30:31] him about his problems he talks to him
[1:30:34] about who God is his wife tried to make
[1:30:37] Job Curse him he said woman you speak
[1:30:39] like a foolish man a foolish
[1:30:42] woman there's a whole lot of people
[1:30:45] that's tried to turn your sound into
[1:30:47] something that you didn't want to
[1:30:48] say come on somebody there's a lot of
[1:30:51] doctors that tried to kill you by sound
[1:30:54] off things that they said you're going
[1:30:55] to go with this you're going to die with
[1:30:57] that but because you refuse that kind of
[1:30:59] a
[1:31:00] sound I heard a sound from heaven and
[1:31:04] said blessed is he that believeth in
[1:31:12] him said well I'm G get I'm GNA get away
[1:31:14] from this sound brother Andrew I'm get
[1:31:15] away from this voice you ain't getting
[1:31:17] away from this
[1:31:19] voice there were some men that went down
[1:31:21] into Spain in the deepest of caves in
[1:31:23] Spain
[1:31:24] closest part to the Center of the Earth
[1:31:26] that you can possibly go and they wanted
[1:31:29] to see if there was any sound there they
[1:31:30] went all the way down in there and they
[1:31:33] got in there and they said if you sat
[1:31:35] there you couldn't hear
[1:31:37] anything at at a certain rate you could
[1:31:40] hear water dripping as you went down and
[1:31:42] down it was completely dry and there was
[1:31:45] Zero
[1:31:46] sound zero
[1:31:49] sound you and I ain't used to that
[1:31:54] but they are sitting in there you can
[1:31:56] completely lose your
[1:31:57] mind setting where there is no
[1:32:00] sound but these men took some
[1:32:02] instruments down in on the inside of
[1:32:04] that cave and even when you can't hear
[1:32:06] with your human ear these instruments
[1:32:09] could hear the sound of the
[1:32:12] Moon they could hear the sound of the
[1:32:14] Moon underneath there and even though
[1:32:16] they couldn't hear it the Earth could
[1:32:18] hear the very power of the Bride calling
[1:32:21] to that Earth and it was speaking and it
[1:32:23] was turning and it had the ability you
[1:32:26] see there's a lot of people that don't
[1:32:28] hear the bride
[1:32:29] sound but you have the ability because a
[1:32:33] jean Sheed of God by the instrumentality
[1:32:35] of almighty God you hear this
[1:32:42] sound people say brother Andrew there's
[1:32:45] no way I can live an overcoming life and
[1:32:48] I can tell you haven't been in the
[1:32:51] message people said I'm still dealing
[1:32:53] with the the problems I dealt with five
[1:32:55] and 10 years ago brother angw how do I
[1:32:57] get rid of them get in the
[1:32:59] message what are you saying I'm saying
[1:33:02] there's an abundance of overcoming life
[1:33:04] in the message there's healing in the
[1:33:06] message there's the holy ghost power in
[1:33:08] the message is well I don't know how to
[1:33:10] get the I don't know how to get the Holy
[1:33:11] Ghost get in the
[1:33:13] message it'll teach you how to get the
[1:33:15] Holy Ghost it'll teach you about how to
[1:33:17] love thy neighbor there's a sound behind
[1:33:20] it and it ain't a limited sound but it's
[1:33:23] an abundance
[1:33:26] abundance when you study that word out
[1:33:28] abundance in the Hebrew I tell you it's
[1:33:31] powerful because the word abundance in
[1:33:33] the Hebrew it means to roar like a
[1:33:36] line surely the Lord Our God will do
[1:33:39] nothing except he reveals these special
[1:33:42] Revelations To His prophets that a Lon
[1:33:45] hath roared in this generation and a
[1:33:47] juted did seven
[1:33:49] voices what have we heard we've heard a
[1:33:52] roar
[1:33:54] come on somebody Satan's going around
[1:33:56] like a roaring line but I say there's
[1:33:58] another voice that's got more power
[1:34:01] that's got more interest in you falling
[1:34:03] by the way of a grave there's a voice
[1:34:05] that's got an abundance of sound behind
[1:34:09] it when brother R Taps into pergam and
[1:34:12] church Ag and I I I'm coming real
[1:34:15] quick but when he Taps into the pergam
[1:34:17] and church AG in Revelations 2:1 17 the
[1:34:20] Bible said to him that overcometh will I
[1:34:23] give to eat of the Hidden mana and
[1:34:26] brother Ron picks that up he said the
[1:34:28] hidden Mana he said it's a little
[1:34:30] something special he said what is the
[1:34:32] special he said he said no it's not
[1:34:35] something the blessings of the Holy
[1:34:36] Ghost oh no that's for the whole
[1:34:38] congregation he said but the hidden Mana
[1:34:41] was a special
[1:34:44] Revelation cuz he had to teach
[1:34:47] others you see was a little more
[1:34:49] knowledge of the scripture that he could
[1:34:50] teach others he's supposed to be you see
[1:34:54] the man the man that begins to teach you
[1:34:57] he better have some
[1:34:58] Revelation he better have some abilities
[1:35:01] brother random said now you're never
[1:35:02] going to live any higher than your
[1:35:03] pastor he said because he was the one
[1:35:06] that was ordained to teach you these
[1:35:08] things you see you'll never live no
[1:35:11] higher than your pastor I say you're
[1:35:13] never going to live any higher than what
[1:35:15] you're feeding on and if you're feeding
[1:35:17] on this message you are built to
[1:35:20] fly are you with me because in this
[1:35:22] message has the ability to take you to
[1:35:25] unlimited power because this message
[1:35:28] breaks a sound
[1:35:30] barrier it breaks a sound barrier and
[1:35:33] this bride has been given access to
[1:35:35] spiritual food and due season and it's
[1:35:37] not just a little bit here to get you
[1:35:39] through on Monday but it's an abundance
[1:35:41] of spiritual food when the rest of the
[1:35:43] world is in a drought and the rest of
[1:35:45] the world hasn't experience the power of
[1:35:47] the Holy Ghost there's a people that are
[1:35:50] experienced the reign of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:52] like never before Elijah stood there the
[1:35:55] tishbite and he called for the Heavens
[1:35:57] to be shut
[1:35:59] up and all of Israel was Without Rain
[1:36:02] for three and a half years neither Dew
[1:36:04] nor rain
[1:36:06] fell but Elijah had a special had some
[1:36:10] hidden Mana because he had somebody that
[1:36:13] talked to him and said you go up there
[1:36:15] to the brook of terth and you sat right
[1:36:17] there and the prophet said he had
[1:36:19] Porters he had Angels coming in there he
[1:36:21] was sipping from the water from the
[1:36:23] brook
[1:36:24] he was eating on the he was eating on
[1:36:26] that on that Heavenly Mana that had come
[1:36:28] down and brother random said in the
[1:36:31] uncertain sound I think that's a
[1:36:33] powerful place to draw this from he said
[1:36:36] there Elijah went up on top of that
[1:36:37] mountain for three and a half years and
[1:36:39] they was all up there the rest of them
[1:36:41] was up there gnawing their tongues for
[1:36:43] pain but he was sitting up there by that
[1:36:45] little Brook little spring had spiritual
[1:36:47] Revelation all the time Waters of Life
[1:36:49] pouring up he said you see he was called
[1:36:53] and he stayed there remember he never
[1:36:56] left that Brook until God Called to
[1:36:59] him what he saying I'm saying stay in
[1:37:02] this
[1:37:06] message I'd say I'd say Elijah has stood
[1:37:09] in this generation and said there's an
[1:37:11] abundance of the sound of rain that's
[1:37:13] coming you may not you may not see it
[1:37:16] yet but I I hear it
[1:37:19] coming you think Elijah up there on
[1:37:22] Mount carel you just just read in MA in
[1:37:24] First Kings 18 he's up there on Mount
[1:37:27] Cara you know all the story there they
[1:37:30] are they ain't got no rain for three and
[1:37:31] a half years but he miraculously
[1:37:33] provides 12 barrels of rain of rain
[1:37:36] water and he goes up there after this
[1:37:40] and the Bible says unto us that Elijah
[1:37:43] goes and lays before the Lord on this
[1:37:45] mountain he ain't got enough strength to
[1:37:47] get up the mountain but he's got enough
[1:37:49] power to get down and pray he's got
[1:37:52] enough power to get down and pray
[1:37:54] a lot of people didn't understand while
[1:37:55] they was
[1:37:56] praying but before he got down and
[1:37:58] prayed he said Ahab I hear the sound of
[1:38:02] the abundance of rain
[1:38:06] coming he saider go up there and look he
[1:38:09] said ain't nothing there prophet he said
[1:38:11] go again and he kept on praying and he
[1:38:13] prayed six times and there was nothing
[1:38:15] there he said but go up
[1:38:17] again you see you never seen The Cloud
[1:38:20] of the son of man until the seventh age
[1:38:23] but in this hour we hear more than a sea
[1:38:26] we see more than the size of a man's
[1:38:28] hand we see a cloud lack unto the son of
[1:38:32] man and it's got an abundance of
[1:38:35] Revelation it's got an abundance of
[1:38:37] spiritual Revelation it's got an
[1:38:39] abundance of healing in it come on
[1:38:42] somebody it's more than just for Georgie
[1:38:44] Carter it's more than just for a little
[1:38:48] fishy that little fishy had the ability
[1:38:51] to hear a sound
[1:38:54] and I heard the prophet say it like this
[1:38:56] one time he said it showed that God was
[1:38:59] interested in the Small
[1:39:03] Things God's interested in the small
[1:39:05] things but what about you what about you
[1:39:08] turning around and letting your sound
[1:39:09] sound off and say God I'm interested in
[1:39:11] you I'm interested if there could come a
[1:39:14] sound out of them Hills and said it's
[1:39:17] time to speak to that little fishy I
[1:39:19] think it's time that we start speaking
[1:39:21] of the abundance of rain that has been
[1:39:23] poured out when the Book of Joel said
[1:39:25] that in the last days I will pour out my
[1:39:27] spirit that I have given unto you
[1:39:30] rejoice I've given unto you the former
[1:39:33] rain moderately and the latter rain
[1:39:35] brother Bram just said he said we could
[1:39:37] not receive the latter rain until we
[1:39:39] receive the teaching rain because the
[1:39:42] Harvest rain is the latter rain the holy
[1:39:45] ghost that comes upon the teaching rain
[1:39:47] the teacher hadn't sowed the seeds but
[1:39:51] when the teaching rain came and the
[1:39:53] seeds have been sowed what is that
[1:39:55] teaching rain it's a restoration rain it
[1:39:59] has restored a people back to believe
[1:40:02] that the Holy Ghost is not just for days
[1:40:04] gone by but it's restored our faith to
[1:40:07] believe there's an abundance of it right
[1:40:10] now that's why the prophet said that the
[1:40:13] latter rain is rapturing faith that this
[1:40:16] rain that's being poured out it's an
[1:40:17] abundance of it come on somebody he's
[1:40:21] not leaving one of his Jean seeds behind
[1:40:23] but there's an unlimited power of an
[1:40:26] abundance of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:40:28] being poured out in this
[1:40:32] generation he didn't say I just give out
[1:40:34] a little bit he said I'll pour out my
[1:40:40] spirit I'm going to empty what I am in
[1:40:43] my own flesh upon my
[1:40:47] people and they shall never be ashamed
[1:40:53] what are you saying brother Andrew I'm
[1:40:56] saying I hear a
[1:40:58] sound and it's a sound of the abundance
[1:41:00] of
[1:41:01] rain but you ain't got to climb the hill
[1:41:04] for
[1:41:07] it you had a prophet stand here in this
[1:41:10] generation said it's here little bride
[1:41:12] there it is there it is he said you
[1:41:15] heard me say I'll keep this until that
[1:41:17] comes he said but no this is that that
[1:41:21] the prophet Joel spoke of that in the
[1:41:23] last days I will pour out my
[1:41:28] spirit I
[1:41:30] say it's a sound of
[1:41:34] rain now I want to come I want to bring
[1:41:37] this
[1:41:40] in the sound that you have
[1:41:43] heard when you hear brother
[1:41:45] brandom he's coming to the closing hours
[1:41:47] of his ministry and his lips are going
[1:41:49] to be sealed and he starts sounding off
[1:41:52] some revelation
[1:41:55] he starts breaking into the Rapture he
[1:41:57] starts breaking into things that are to
[1:41:58] be he starts breaking into modern events
[1:42:00] made clear by prophecy he starts
[1:42:02] breaking in he starts breaking into
[1:42:04] communion and he starts going into those
[1:42:05] things what is brother bandham doing he
[1:42:07] realizes that his lips are getting ready
[1:42:09] to be closed and he realizes that Satan
[1:42:12] is trying his best and he's been on your
[1:42:14] Trail the whole entire time but this
[1:42:16] message has exposed that Serpent's Trail
[1:42:19] this message has exposed where he is you
[1:42:21] see you see that what they what Satan
[1:42:24] tried to do when he had a drunk driver
[1:42:26] come down the road and smash into a
[1:42:28] prophet's vehicle it was the one thing
[1:42:30] that William Brandon fought so hard
[1:42:32] against was alcohol he had fought
[1:42:34] against it but Satan used some boys that
[1:42:37] had been drunk on
[1:42:39] alcohol to seal the lips of a
[1:42:43] prophet and I want to say this Satan you
[1:42:46] showed up too
[1:42:48] late you showed up too late because a
[1:42:51] message got through
[1:42:54] let me say this they will reject the
[1:42:57] teaching Reign but if the sword has
[1:42:59] already been sown then Satan can't stop
[1:43:03] it they said there's no power in this
[1:43:05] message I say Satan you showed up too
[1:43:07] late you say you children can't get the
[1:43:09] Holy Ghost I say you showed up too late
[1:43:12] you say you can't get healed you showed
[1:43:14] up too
[1:43:18] late I hear the sound of rain
[1:43:23] what if somebody could shout out I hear
[1:43:25] the sound of perfect healing I hear the
[1:43:27] sound of a sound mind I hear the sound
[1:43:30] of prodical coming back I hear a
[1:43:34] [Applause]
[1:43:37] sound I hear a sound I hear a
[1:43:45] sound even when Elijah didn't see it he
[1:43:50] was looking at the Unseen
[1:43:53] parents I want to say this to
[1:43:55] you when you don't see your young people
[1:43:58] and your children getting in line with
[1:43:59] this message you keep looking at the
[1:44:01] Unseen don't you get disappointed in
[1:44:04] them you keep your eyes on him you keep
[1:44:07] your eyes on this message let me say it
[1:44:09] like this I was I was a bad boy I bet I
[1:44:12] was a preacher son but that didn't give
[1:44:14] me rights to the Holy Ghost but because
[1:44:17] there was an abundance of the rain in
[1:44:19] this generation that God was able to
[1:44:21] wash away my sin
[1:44:23] he was able to fill me with his holy
[1:44:26] spirit there's a voice behind this
[1:44:29] message is for you it's for your
[1:44:32] children it's for them that's a far off
[1:44:35] there's a lot of people they not
[1:44:37] understand this
[1:44:42] voice but it speaks something to
[1:44:45] you I know a lot of people that that go
[1:44:48] to sleep with sound machines
[1:44:53] I know a personal friend of mine a
[1:44:55] traveling evangelist he goes everywhere
[1:44:57] doesn't matter where he's going he
[1:44:58] travels with a box fan he's got used to
[1:45:01] sleeping with
[1:45:04] it many of you sleep with sounds of rain
[1:45:07] at night
[1:45:10] time what is it is that
[1:45:12] rain brings calming it brings peace some
[1:45:17] people hear them sounds I hear and they
[1:45:18] say it sounds like fried chicken bans
[1:45:20] fried
[1:45:21] up that's what somebody told me
[1:45:26] about but there's something about the
[1:45:28] sound of rain that it brings healing it
[1:45:33] brings
[1:45:35] peace what is this
[1:45:39] rain now what is this
[1:45:41] rain that's poured out in this
[1:45:44] day what is this message it's not a
[1:45:47] message of disgrace it's a message of
[1:45:50] Grace what is his rain it's a whole Holy
[1:45:53] Ghost
[1:45:54] rain I don't say that the rain that's
[1:45:56] being poured out has got peace behind it
[1:45:59] I want to say this that you are on the
[1:46:02] cusp of
[1:46:07] peace I want somebody say this I hear
[1:46:10] the sound of
[1:46:14] rain now you're not just hearing it with
[1:46:16] your ears but you're hearing it from an
[1:46:18] understanding that God give
[1:46:20] you because you see The Voice
[1:46:23] and the person are the same thing so
[1:46:27] they got to line up so what he is has
[1:46:30] got to be coming out of that sound so if
[1:46:33] if I stood up here and tried to tell you
[1:46:34] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:46:36] forever but I told you that he doesn't
[1:46:38] heal no more then you would tell me that
[1:46:41] there's something wrong with my
[1:46:44] sound and if you try to tell me that you
[1:46:47] can't have peace I say there's something
[1:46:49] wrong with the sound that you're
[1:46:50] listening to if you tell me that your
[1:46:52] family is not not not having calmness
[1:46:54] and not having healing and there's not
[1:46:56] having Liberty and they're not having
[1:46:58] Victory I said there's something wrong
[1:47:00] with this sound but if I could tell you
[1:47:03] if you can listen to this sound it's
[1:47:06] unlimited it's got power it's got
[1:47:14] anointing to me what is so amazing about
[1:47:16] this sound and I I I'm closing I know I
[1:47:20] I probably cooked you Goose again
[1:47:24] but to me is what
[1:47:26] amazing about this message is the
[1:47:29] refreshing it
[1:47:31] has I'll just be dead honest with you
[1:47:34] brother Ron I get sick and tired of
[1:47:35] waking up and seeing the
[1:47:37] news so just don't read it when I get
[1:47:40] sick and tired you can't hide just
[1:47:42] because you don't read the news you
[1:47:43] can't hide from Le Osa it's right in
[1:47:44] your face I hate having to tell my
[1:47:47] children about Sodom and Gomorrah I hate
[1:47:49] after teaching them them things are
[1:47:51] wrong I I hate seeing no
[1:47:54] Saints but this message has brought
[1:47:57] about a rain to it that has given us an
[1:48:02] escape that's given us an escape out of
[1:48:04] this thing it's a refreshing in it
[1:48:08] because you can get
[1:48:11] so bound
[1:48:13] up by the things of this
[1:48:17] world but Elijah had so much
[1:48:20] refreshing by the sound
[1:48:26] when Jezebel had took a lot out of
[1:48:29] him when Israel would not repent it took
[1:48:34] a lot out of
[1:48:35] Elijah he just got done dealing with all
[1:48:38] these shouting baale worshippers it took
[1:48:41] a lot out of
[1:48:42] it I'll be honest leot can take a lot
[1:48:45] out of
[1:48:46] you people can wear you out your boss
[1:48:50] can wear you out your family matters can
[1:48:51] wear you out
[1:48:53] but this message has got some refreshing
[1:48:55] in it because Elijah was looking at
[1:48:58] something he couldn't see but all of a
[1:49:01] sudden brother Bram said that one Cloud
[1:49:03] became two clouds and that two clouds
[1:49:05] became a hill and that Hill became a
[1:49:07] mountain and that mountain became two
[1:49:09] mountains and before long the clouds
[1:49:12] were
[1:49:13] rolling he said something struck Elijah
[1:49:16] that it sent a refreshing on the inside
[1:49:18] of him that he outran ahab's heart say
[1:49:23] 17
[1:49:26] miles and I tell you what that's some
[1:49:29] refreshing right
[1:49:31] there I'll be honest I'm going to run 17
[1:49:34] miles I better get some of that kind of
[1:49:35] refreshing I'm probably going to pass
[1:49:37] out after number
[1:49:40] two let me say this and I'm closing on
[1:49:42] this powerful point but we ain't in this
[1:49:44] thing just for one mile or two miles
[1:49:46] we're going to run our last mile home
[1:49:49] come on musicians let's run this message
[1:49:52] M has got some refreshing in it and even
[1:49:55] though they ought to see has beat us
[1:49:56] down let's re receive a refreshing from
