we've definitely had a full week here we received all of our family back from the Louisiana Camp there on Monday and they all got back in and and every one of them were just so elated with their each of their experience and and each of them receiving their own personal touch of the Holy Spirit how that he dealt with them individually and that's what I love about the Lord he's so personal and he's so real and you know he knows how to come to us and speak to us and what might seem small to somebody it's very major for somebody else and I just love how the Lord can can express his love to us and what are you doing there you supposed to be over here threw me off man oh oh man that's an awful powerful amen coming from that second row there so so well well that's right make room hey let's let's make room in this place we we believe in making room here so but uh uh we we just thank the Lord for for all of his grace for all the all the helpers the drivers that were able to go they were hey when when we got counselors coming back and saying they were perfect kids you know and just just great all the way no hiccups no accidents that's a long way 17 hours one way and 17 hours back with no accidents that's the grace of the Lord and then to receive them back and to see them full of the Holy Ghost and charged and I tell you what it's just just it just does our heart great good God bless you Sister CL good to see you and then they took good great care of our pastor down there Louisiana I want y'all know that they took really good care of him and they were the best that they could be to him but you know uh we just we serve a real we serve a real God and we Face a real enemy and uh you know it had been said that brother Ron r back the clock and preach like a young man and then he come back here on Monday and spent the day with us and on Tuesday had a had a severe heart attack there and and brother Matthews already went through those details and so we just want to be mindful and of our of our pastor and be remembering him and got home from the hospital there yesterday and and uh yeah he's home and he's and uh I've give him full permission to stay home as long as he needs to and and uh so you know the Lord is in control of every situation because while brother Ron is sitting in the hospital he's having the heart attack it if it had been 20 minutes difference you know it could have been a been a major thing you know basically this is how you look at things we were 20 minutes away from a funeral this week and and so we we just realize how how powerful our Lord is that he controls every circumstance of our life for his calling in our life and so we just we want to be mindful of our pastor and want to be praying for him and I'll be taking the services for quite some time here and until brother Ron feels feels like coming back and taking the pull pit he he he definitely wants to uh be here for your your wedding sister Hannah brother Chester wants to be be a part of that and and uh so so we just we're just going to take our time with the Lord and let the Lord work out all the details in brother Ron's life he's he's got him here this far and he'll take him the rest of the way and so I'll be taking the services and uh for for some time the next weekend brother Isaac Hatfield will be ministering for us on Saturday night and then uh Lord willing we're going to be having a wedding that Sunday and still working out the details on the baptismal there that Sunday but we'll we'll work all those things out and I will need some help tomorrow Brothers after service to remove this platform here and certainly thankful to have brother Isaac coming and speaking for us next weekend he's a young man that's full of the Holy Ghost and the Lord's put a a very unique gift in his life to preach the message and and uh we're very grateful to have a man of God like brother Isaac and we've told him he cannot come here without sister Bethany and amen so if he comes here without her we just we ain't going to let him preach so and so I asked him the other day as I said one of days sister Bethany going to let you sing with uh sing with you he said well maybe one day so so but uh so but when brother Ron gets back in this pull pit the devil better watch out that's all I got to say so how many love the Lord tonight amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord let's just go to the Lord in prayer here tonight Heavenly Father we come boldly before your throne father Lord recognizing how great that your mercy and your grace is Upon Our Life father that every detail Lord every circumstance is a part of our calling in our election father Lord we can never can never discount Lord one instance in our life father because it's it's you getting us to a place that you have destined for us father in this journey and Lord we just want to be very sensitive to the call of the Lord Upon Our Life father that we that we match the very promise of your word in this hour Lord and we just we ask Lord that you would come amongst us with a supernatural charge of the Holy Ghost here tonight Lord there's some things that you've dealt with me on this week father and I just want to get myself out of the way father and to minister these things and Lord I cannot do this on my own so father I invite you father to take this P pit just now take Lord over my vessel father as I give over to you and yield over I pray that the blessings of God would come Lord and you would deliver a word in due season for your children now father we'll be careful to serve you and praise you and give you all the glory and honor I pray you be very mindful of our pastor brother Ron here tonight Lord he's Lord he's it's a miracle that how that you have kept his life so many times father there's brother Ron's testimony is just is it's an amazing story of Grace father and Lord Full Gospel Lighthouse has seen the very hero of Faith raised right up amongst them Lord and to see the faith of of a man Lord to preach this message and to live it out father and I I pray God that you would just bless him abundantly Lord in his body Lord it it hurts us Lord to to look at a man to see that he has to go through all of these things but Lord I I'm so grateful to know that you have a plan in every one of our lives and I pray father that you would just restore him he's had a great big week father in his body but I serve a great God that paid for all of his healing right there in Isaiah 53 when you were at the cross father you paid for brother Ron's healing and I pray father for a surge of the Holy Ghost to go by the way of the Spencers just now and you'd minister to him in a very special way father we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen if you have your Bibles this evening wouldd like to look over in the Book of John 3:14 John 3 verse 14 Hallelujah you love the Lord John 3:14 and as Moses lifted up the Ser serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so so love the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life may God bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord I would like to speak to you tonight on the 11th commandment the 11th commandment and this we know that that God is is is so powerful and that his ways are higher than our ways and we know that by the studying out the Bible that that God is love and that God is that God is the word love is found throughout all of the Bible over 300 times so God laced in his word a very very attribute of himself which is love and God God laid some very powerful things in scriptures on love and it would take us it would take us quite some time to be able to express what the love of God truly is and brother randam said that the mightiest Force there is on Earth is love that's exactly there's nothing that will break down love no matter what it is brother bam one time would use an analogy about talking about he he would talk about the love of God and how powerful that the love of God is he said could you imagine taking all of the water that there is here on Earth and take it and and you would pack it into us in a into a pipe and that would maybe be this big around he said and he put it up there at the top he said you can imagine all the thousands of miles of air of pipe that would be there he said and he said then he said all of that water he said all of that pressure that is on top of that pipe he said that would be equivalent to the power of God's love that is trying to work in this building or work in this meeting or work in our lives he said just that very pressure of divine love everything he said that's what he's trying to do is his love is trying to press its way into a people so we recognize that by the prophet's language that love is a very powerful very powerful thing brother Brandon would preach on love God's love projected he would preach right here in Harrisonburg on on on love he would say some very powerful things and even prominent things to our area right here in that message of Love brother brandom said that love is a powerful force and he said when love is projected and when it comes to the end of its strength then Sovereign Grace will take it up from there and will grant the object that love has asked for he said that is the reason that we have a savior tonight that God so loved the world that his love being projected toward the World produced a savior he said God wanted so much to see you well that his love went out and it produced an atonement for your sickness as well as your sins he said it was the love of God that constrained him to to do it he said nothing is greater than love he said it brings trust it brings faith it brings part and love has no fear love cast out fear I have found a great deal of fear amongst Christians he said this is not he said this is not right and should not be so he said because the fear is the lack of confidence fear is the lack of confidence he said but if you love and have confidence you will Cast Away fear God wants you to have love and confidence confidence in him he said and this will Cast Away your fears and bring you to serve him with a greater love that's what the love of God does it literally throws away your fear the idea that you can't live up to the status of being a Christian the love of God throws that away the idea that you will not get made will not be made whole Love cast that away the idea that you won't be in a Rapture love cast that away now love is not based on legalistic laws laws that we have to keep love is based on faith in one another faith in God trust in God and confidence in God that's what love is based on he said I will tell you this my friends that when the love of God comes into your heart you won't go around hurting or being hurt when you believe God you really believe him and get married to him that you die out to the things of the world then God projects his love and his love is what makes you what you are love is what makes you what you are you think about the love that a husband has towards his wife it's amazing what that love can do that love can literally change a human being it literally can make them and that is just a human love it can literally change them because they want to match the Desir of their helpmate and I I'll just tell you right now Love Is in the Air there's been more there's been more engagements in the last in the last three months amongst the people of the Bride then then I then I I'll be honest I was really praying about these things I was I was praying very he heavily about these things because I was I was concerned about it then all of a sudden we we had a little thing at our youth group and I I'll tell you brother Vernon you'd have been proud of brother Matthew I asked him to just kind of give a little a little session on love and what it is to love somebody and find a help mate and I tell you ever since Matthew gave that conversation I tell you I tell you what anybody needing a church that's got young people that are afraid to talk and get and get hooked up together and talk to each other we'll we'll hire brother Matthew out I mean look at it I got Malachi and sister Khloe over here engaged he wasn't even here when Matthew told it that's how power powerful that it was now notice now notice I'm still in line with our thought on the dividing of inheritance because if you don't have love you can't move into the promises of God that's just how it is if you don't love God if you don't love his word if you don't love this message you can never do anything for god without the love of God being on the inside of you you've got to love him for this message to become a reality you've got to love the message for you to Express what the message is you've got to love God now notice what the Bible said in Deuteronomy 11:11 but the land with you go to possess it it is a land of Hills and Valleys and drinketh water of the rain of Heaven A Land which the Lord thy God carth for the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it from the beginning of the year even un the end of the year and it shall come to pass that if you hearken diligently unto my Commandments which I command man you this day to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all of your heart and with all of your soul notice how powerful that that that this word is that he says that I will give you the rain of your land in its due season the first rain and the latter rain that thou mayest Gather in thy corn and thy Wayne thy wine and thine oil you think how powerful that this love of God God that all of your heart that that if you love his Commandments if you diligently seek him if you think about it in this aspect that love is the controlling factor that it is hanging upon the contingencies of the promises all of these are contention upon loving God and serving God do you recognize that the latter R which is the Holy Ghost is literally contingent upon love now notice brother manam here in Harrisonburg said this he said therefore John 3:16 tonight he said although it's small in portion he said it holds enough value to save the world and the church said he said it's got enough value in it to heal every sick person that's on the Earth today it's a pardon to every sinner it's joy to every weary person it's hope for the Hopeless it's food for the saint it's healing for the sick it's pardon for those who are troubled he said it's all those things if you you receive it it as as that if you receive it as that it's got enough value in it to save you it's got enough power in it to heal you if you receive John 3:16 it's got enough value to save the world now love is is is very descriptive now love has got two different meanings with two different words to describe it in the Greek One Love is called fio that is a natural love that you would have for your wife but agape love means divine love and these two loves are very contrary to each other for example with the love that you have for your wife he said if a man would insult her you would kill him on the spot that would be filio love but with agap love or Divine love you would pray for the man's lost soul how many needs a little bit more of love in their life he said that is the difference he said I'm almost sure that many of us have been deceived with fio love and thinking it was agape love fio love is an intellectual whereas Agape comes agape love comes from the heart human love or affectionate love is from the mind the love of God is from the heart now felo love will always doubt and question it's a amazing when you begin to study these things out that you'll find what kind of faith and love how that they are intertwined together that felo love will always doubt and will always question but agape love will always rest and be in PE in peace human love is always reasoning but Godly love never does so if you're constantly reasoning about the word of God it shows what kind of love that you have in your heart but but if you have a kind of love if you have that kind of faith that Godly love is Perhaps Perhaps in its trust it produces faith when you really love with God's kind of love fear is to distrust God that's what fear is fear is constantly wondering wondering or putting and reasoning things in your mind if am I going to get well am I going what fear does it paralyzes you so that you can't operate in perfect love but perfect love cast out fear now notice that when Jesus comes down to John Chapter 13 I'm just going to lay some foundational things here tonight that when Jesus comes down here in John Chapter 13 and he starts coming in there and he's getting ready to take them into things that are to be that Jesus begins to lace this commandment of love right there in in in in the chapter of verse chapter 13 but notice when he begins to express he begins to express the this new commandment it is after he exposes his Judas betrayal notice what he says here in verse 33 little children now ain't nobody understands love like a little child you can take little Uriah right there or you could take little aah or any of these little children and they can there there's nothing like the love of a child because you could take yourself and you put yourself in the picture and they won't look at you the same way that they look at brother Gabriel or Sister Sarah it's because something is different you might hold them the same way that they do you might you might handle them the same way that they do but it's something that they are connected but notice how that the Lord identifies a little child in this picture of love it's because a child implies great tenderness and affection the little children yet a little while and I'm with you and you shall seek me as I had said unto the Jews whether I go you cannot come so now I say to you a new commandment the 11th commandment a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you and that you also love one another by this you shall know that all men that all men know by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love of one another not by you going out and speaking a storm out of existence not by you going out and creating squirrels not by you going out and moving mountains by this shall all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one to another I tell you one thing thing that this age is lacking is love and it's not the kind of love that the world is trying to produce but it's the very love of almighty God that this world is lacking what is it it's lacking love for the word I tell you your love I'll tell you what Jesus is saying here he's saying Your Love would look like my love by this shall all men know that you are my disciples that you follow me is that when you have love one towards another it's not a worldly love that looks like look like Le osa's love I know a lot of people got their ideas of what love is or what men think love is or or what they think the love of God is but God is perfect his life is perfect his word is perfect the holy spirit is perfect and even men amongst the message have tried to take what brother randam said there in in stat of a perfect man and isolated down into a thought of what they think that perfect love is and they build it up so that a man cannot attain power he cannot attain he cannot attain full truth it's because it's because men have taken away what love truly is is that right that one day will be perfect that one day will receive perfect love and that one day will'll be able to keep all of these promises what are they doing they're trying to keep the promises of God at a distance trying to show that it's one day in the future that that it's one day out there what are they doing they're trying to keep the very power of God away from the Church of the Living God because brother random said in a statue of a perfect man he said notice notice the prophet would progress but many people stop at the Statue of a perfect man and don't go all the way down through the seals notice he says he said the next thing is to add charity after brotherly kindness he said which is love he said that's the capping Stone one of these days in the church but notice what brother random goes on to say in paragraph 344 he said but when we not in an imaginary way but portrayed ourselves before a living God in a living virtue a living knowledge a living patience a living godliness a living power coming from a living God making a living man Liv in image the stature of God so what is when Peter is preaching these things add to your faith virtue out of your virtue knowledge out of your knowledge Temperance and patience brotherly kindness now it's not works love is not works I do not work myself way my work my way up so that my wife loves me she loves me you are never going to work your way up by doing good deeds to people so that God loves you the reason why God loves you is because he elected you before the foundation of the world he said the same thing that Jesus did walking the same way that he walked doing the same thing that he did because it's not an imaginary thing these are not just these are not just attributes these are not just works but it's a reality that proves because when brother brandham comes on the back side of the seals and he preaches the token life he said when you come back and he said watch what's come after them Seven Seals he said it's the uniting of the people United signs the red lights flashing in the last days he said the sign of women getting prettier and Men what would they do he said now all of these signs of the Holy Spirit leading then can come right back up to the capping off of all of the messages since the Seven Seals he said it's capped off in this one thing the token there is the capping Stone well brother Andrew one of these days we'll have perfect love brother bandam said it's going to take perfect love to get in there because that's the only thing that was there is perfect love now if it's going to take perfect love to get in there surely we've got to be able to attain perfect love it's not something out there in the future the token is the capping Ministry of the message the baptism of the Holy Ghost is your adoption robe it is your Abstract title deed that's why Paul would say in r Romans chapter 8 it is your adoption message there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit there it is church what shall we say to these things if God be for us if God be in us then who can be against us nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God how can you separate ah I'm trying I'm trying to be my best here but how can you separate me from the message how can you separate the messenger from the message how can you separate me from Christ in all of these things in trials in heartaches in heart attacks in cancer in Demon oppression in Demon depression in all of these things nothing shall be able to separate us from the love not of humanity but the love of God now notice when brother bandam comes and I'm just laying some things out and if you want any of these notes here tonight I'll give them all to you I got 30 pages and I ain't going to preach them to you all tonight but I'm going to get to some spots and I want to I want you to just lay these things in there so if you want them I'll give them to you I'll give them to the brothers and they can give it to you but brother brandom said in a th TI in church ches he said yes sir if you're a Christian you're going to do what's right that's pretty powerful ain't it if you're a Christian you're going to do what's right well brother Andrew do I got to do this if you're a Christian you're going to do what's right I got people come to me and say well I got I ain't done this right I ain't done that if you're a Christian you're going to do what's right well I I I wouldn't I I would and did this wrong thing if you're a Christian you're going to do what's right I don't know how to make it more simple than that if you're a Christian you're going to do what's right look at your neighbor say if you're a Christian you're going to do what's right your Works will show that your heart is right and it won't be something that you put on for you will do his will when no one but God sees you and you will do his will even if it cost you your life I know your love notice he he he pulls from second Timothy he said I know your love your service faith and patience he said you will note that their love is placed between works and service and that is the right place for it because without love our works are not accepted before God and neither is our service Paul speaking to the Corinthians said without love I am nothing and whatever I do is without profit unless it is done in love now you can see right here that these Believers weren't in that nickel ladyann or to be admired by men they did their works out of the love of God that was shed abroad in their hearts by the holy ghost that love in their hearts was God's Own love for his own Jesus said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples that you have a love for one another notice what he says he said the pagans who sold the lives of the early Christians said behold how they love each other amen behold how they love each other well you don't know I look that person up on Facebook and I know their backdrop behold how they love one another well brother Andrew if You' had Facebook this week if you'd have seen what I seen you wouldn't have that kind of love towards him behold how they love one another by this shall all men know that you're my disciples when you have love not when they make a mistake not when they fall but when you love them when they shouldn't receive love what kind of love are you talking about I'm talking about the Father's Love if you love somebody when they done you wrong it's proof that that ain't your love that's the Father's Love Hallelujah Matthew 22 and 36 when a lawyer came to him and said Master what is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is lik unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself under these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets now Jesus emphasizes the power of this commandment is to love thy neighbor as thyself when all of Israel is not just given 10 commandments they're given 613 Commandments they couldn't keep them they couldn't live up to it but Jesus summarized all of the six 63 laws that was given to them in these two Commandments the Lord love the Lord with all our heart with all thy soul and with all thy might and to love thy neighbor as thyself what does that mean brother Andrew that means that you love yourself more than anybody else in this building you watch a fire break out in this building you might love the people right beside you with a filo love but Who you gonna get out first number one baby well not me brother Andrew I'd be right here to the very end I'd stand there in the smoke right near fire that's pretty impressive you must have that son of man kind of fire about you that you can stand right there in the midst of it you love yourself more than anybody else who'd you dress this morning who'd you feed this morning who is the very first one you got coffee for you or your neighbor Hallelujah thou shallal love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might because if you love God you love others is that right brother random would say it like this and I completely agree he said if you want to do something nice for me he said do it to my children don't do something for nice for me I tell you right now biggest fight you ever going to get in with me you can say anything you want to about me but don't you dare say nothing about my children or my parents you want to do something nice for me do something nice for my children let me move on he said now when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life wow when you live your life for yourself you don't have eternal life when you look about upon this age that it's exactly what what what what we read in the what happened in heaven that Lucifer was all about I lifting myself I I I I I this is the age of I of people's rights but if you live your life to yourself you haven't got eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when it come into the Lamb of God he lived he had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day that that you don't live for yourself no more you live for others someone said how can you stand and any let anybody call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man he he said you become Sons he said and the trouble of it is the church has forgot that they were Sons you're Sons you're taking Christ Place your sons so don't live for yourself live for others well what's it all about what's the message about live for others one of the most powerful things about the Holy Ghost is when you experience it for yourself it's about passing it on to somebody else you watch any of these young people you watch any of them they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost what's the first thing that they want to do they want to testify about it but we live in an age where men want to squash out living for others and silence our voices so that we don't testify about how great the love of God is well let me testify right now that if he loved me when I was unlovable and when you is unlovable then he's got enough love left in his bank to redeem Humanity let's get into a sticky situation well brother brandham I can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man that's not it live for the that man who hates you live for that person who'd kill you if they could that's what they' done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when you get that in your bosom you're facing heaven then you're facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things and give them up like a little sheep gives up its wo you look on towards Calvary what are you talking about brother Andrew I'm talking about the kind of love that when brother bandam is standing down there in Mexico and that blind man is standing there and he's he's a old daddy and brother B said my heart just went out for him he said we done watch that little baby that had been dead for 10 hours how that that mother had that kind of a love that she wouldn't bury that baby she loved that baby and she took that baby through the waters through the rain stood at there it was a mother's love that was projected that produced Sovereign grace that brought her baby back that kind of love is a goap love It's Supernatural love brother brandham stood there he said I looked on that old blind man he said I looked at him and he said he said the greatest success of any prayer is being able to put yourself in that person's burden he said so I literally put myself in his shoes and said father bless this old blind daddy surely he's got babies back there surely he's got grandchildren surely he's got work to do he said and when I put myself in his shoes when I got into such a spot of sympathy he said then I heard him sing out shout out Glory because what love was projected love was projected what was it it was a surge of love that went through him what was it that that David's Mighty Men all of them David's an outcast David's hiding in the hiding in the cave but what made them stick with him love love made him do that when Saul was hunting him out love made him stay with him because they saw something on David's life that sa didn't have that's powerful when you're hiding in a cave and you so love God when you so love God you care about you care more about the kingdom of God than your circumstances that you're in that's we're overcoming is we you can look into a cave and you can still see that you're right in purpose it's like David David so loved God he so loved God that he was not going to allow Goliath to stand there and defile the name of the almighty God so he shut up a Goliath he so loved those sheep that he went after the bear and he went after the lion why because he had love notice in Romans 13 and8 oh no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law for this Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not covet if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law I know what the world's done I know what the world's done they've taken they've taken the power of these scriptures right here and they watered it down and tried to make the word of God to fit their agenda you just go reading some of their of their pages and you begin to read some of their you begin to read some of their thoughts and man it looks exactly like the scripture you go to reading first John 4 and I'm going to give you some homework go read first John 4 all on your own maybe labor in some some of those salts here but you'll find that that this age says that we love because he first loved us that's what they say well that that it's really it's really something it's really something but they left out one key part we love him because he first loved us the kind of love that LE utsy is producing is not the kind of love that God is I was standing in Disney World not too long ago at Christmas time and I thought it pretty pretty Supernatural that there we were standing in Disney World one of one of the most I'll tell you what it takes a love of God to be able to go down there and actually live right and I ain't talking about cotton candy and all them waffles or anything like that but Sodom is right there in your face but here they were they they actually had something pretty profound they had a they had a a uh I had at a concert deal where they was putting on they was B basically telling the birth of Christ and they were telling all I thought man that's pretty powerful right here in Disney World when he got Sodom all around but the picture they were painting is that the power of the story is love they didn't point one thing to Jesus they didn't put one thing on Christ and that's the kind of love that New York wants that New Jersey wants that Texas wants that California wants that kind of love is psychology that kind of love is is is knowledge but the love of God is Not psychology the love of God is Not knowledge the love of God is not some mental workup the love of God is power the love of God is Jesus the love of God is truth the love of God is life the love of God is corrective the love of God is pure the love of God love is when you see your child out there in the street brother Brandon would say and you got enough love about yourself to go out there and get him out the street but the kind of love that lay OS see is wanting to produce is Johnny you're okay out there you'll get up out of that mess one of these days you'll figure it out on your own you'll be okay that's psychology that's knowledge that's that's putting that's putting something over that's putting something over on a child that a child ain't got well we just love our children brother aners so we got to give them anything and everything that ain't love baby love is a protective kind of love love will protect you from sin love will protect you from change love will protect you from depression love and parent it's our duty to love our children with a corrective kind of love I sure loved a rid Rider BB gun I sure did I killed myself a lot of Indians with that thing but it was real love when my daddy saw me going to the gun cabinet trying to get a 30 out 6 when I was 6 years old not today a day will come for that but today is not that day but the kind of love that LE ought to see said well just give it to him and you think why we got the mess that we're in let me preach let me preach 1 Corinthians 13 though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and I have not charity I am nothing let me tell you right now I'm the first one to tell you that you got everybody every right to live in Liberty in this place if God so put it on your heart to give you a gift of speaking in tongues and prophesying and knowledge and all those things hey God's got them right here in this church but if you ain't got love to back up that gift stay silent ah preach a message brother Andrew I'm right in line with it and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have charity and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned though I give what them stores called what Mercy house uh Salvation Army uh all them places I give all them things to him and have not love I am nothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity the charity vaunteth not itself it's not puffed up does not behave itself unseemingly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinking no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth come on preach on them bob hair women brother Andrew rejoices in truth preach on men looking like women and wear skinny jeans rejoiceth in truth oh do you love me oh do you love me ah tell me it's okay for me to stay home and watch a ball Game and Watch I love Susi well some of y'all ain't never watched I love Susi and some of his kids don't even know what it is but they'll sure stay home to watch a ball game and to stay home and to look at all kinds of evil manner things I don't know about this brother Andrew it's getting too hot and heavy for me rejoiceth at truth what verse we on six man we got a long way to go beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never fails love conquers all but whether they be prophecies they shall fall whether they be tongues they shall cease whether they be knowledge it shall fish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things well brother Andrew we see right here that when perfect love comes that all this speaking in tongues and shoutings and physical workings that'll be done away with we'll move on to maturity now God wants us to have a heart God wants us to have tenderness of a child but not to be childish there's a major difference between being childlike and being childish and to sit there and to think that when perfect love comes that all these things will be done away with here is childish I'll tell you what you got on you you got your when I'm Alexander Campbell Church of Christ Spirit on you that's a Church of Christ idea that would sit there and say now when perfect love has come we'll do away with those things let me tell you we ain't perfect yet we have a portion of perfect love but we are not in a perfect body but when we get to heaven we're not going to need to speak in tongues and to prophesy and to lay hands on the sick and to see them recover when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part will be done away with we still need prophesying we still need speaking in tongues we still need the gifts of the body and perfect love will put them perfectly in line in the bride's [Applause] body it's like brother R would talk about an apple tree he said it's like he said it's he said it's like an apple tree it's got all the attributes of the tree he said but you get out there and you start picking up the apples and you think you really got it but you don't have the tree yet he said the Pentecostal Sky he said it's it's the Pentecostal skies are loaded right now he said but Pentecost is an experience that constrains you to the love of God he said all of these things he said they're attributes he said it's apples on a tree that fall off the tree he said but don't get the Apple before the tree get the tree and you'll have the apples oh come on and preach with me brother Andrew I believe I will get a hold of the tree of life and you'll have the fruits of the spirit well brother Andrew we got to work our way through faith we got to work our way up through sanctification we got to work our way through up through justification sanctification restoring of the gifts and finally that we'll get there one day that we'll receive our adoption robes you're absolutely wrong when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a Son of God it is your adoptive robe right there to operate as a son and when you have the Holy Ghost not something on the Motions not something on the flesh but on your soul as a Son of God you have love I'll tell you how powerful The Love Is Love is a very powerful thing is very powerful Philo love is a very powerful thing I tell you how powerful love is that brother brandom actually thought that love was the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's how powerful that it is because when brother brandham is sitting down with brother lale and he ask him said now brother Bram what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost he said well I can't say it's the evidence he said I can't see the evidence of the Holy Ghost of speaking in tongues he said I can't see that he said well I can't see that either he said then I would have to say that love is the evidence of the Holy Ghost and while brother berham is sitting there talking the spirit of the Lord speaks to him and tells him that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is being able to receive the word of God that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost you see you see we can have we can have the full train we can have the train setting out here on the tracks we can have the MOG mahogany floors we can have all the bells and whistles on it but if it ain't got no steam in it if it ain't got no power in it if it ain't got no love in it then it'll set right there dead as a doornail but if you can put love in there if you can put some bowling power of faith and love working together it'll boil the very sin right out of your life that's the kind of love I tell you how powerful Love Is Love covers a multitudes oh yeah of sins what is it that makes you forgive your brother what is it makes you overlook their weaknesses love makes you do that if you don't have that kind of love in your marriage your marriage is not going to last very long if you constantly stay there in your first year of marriage of bickering what kind of toothpaste that you're going to use and your toothbrush goes on the left side and hers goes on the right side you are going to live a miserable life if you ever learned to figure this out that when your wife is cooking for you and she makes you cornbread and she don't make it like your mama made it and all of a sudden you say what you put in there that ain't like Mama fixed it you going to live a miserable life one of our Elder deons deacons here taught me that very early in my marriage don't say what I said it'll get you in trouble because if you don't figure out how to say the right things and how to let things go anybody can sit there and argue to they're mad and the blue in the face but it takes a real man a real man man real man I I I I'm sorry I really don't think you meant it how you know cuz your actions are speaking different than your words you remember when brother Brandon was there in the home and sister m is all stewed up and everything brother brand said I had to change the atmosphere the kids ain't got nothing to eat and everything else everything's hot and bothered and she goes in through there build the kids I've had so many people running through here and so many people coming in for prayer and she was so worked up another man said I simply went in there and I started saying little little little things to her he said I started changing the atmosphere how in the world am I here and I start changing the atmosphere and saying the right kind of things love covers a multitude of sin Jesus said in John 14 if you love me keep my Commandments verse 23 said if a man loved me he will keep my words so you could not love him in your natural birth you couldn't keep his word in your natural birth you couldn't love him in your natural birth there was something on the inside of you that draw you to him but you kept breaking his word but when you were born again when you were born from another realm you could really love him and love his word notice 1 John 4 and 8 he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love and in this was manifested the love of God towards us because they God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him herein is love not that we love God but that he loved us and sent us his son to be the priation for our sins verse 12 no man ha seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US hereby know we know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he giveth us of his Spirit Verse 18 there is no fear in love if you fall you're not afraid that's perfect love perfect love is when you fall you're not afraid he's going to cast you away You're a part of him but love will make you go to him and repent oh my there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us let me ask you a question what makes you long and live for this message really what what makes you what's so different about you than all these other people that walk past these streets go past this road go past this sign looked at these same books looked at these same pictures heard the same stories what makes you love this message like you do other people heard it other people's looked at it other people stood there but what makes you love him the way you do it's because he loved you first we love him because he first loved us we love this message because this message first loved us so he changed us to match his kind of love Esau Esau looked like the right kind of man man and Jacob didn't but Jacob had the heart of the father so he Chang Jacob's name to match the character that was on the inside of him look at Abraham he couldn't produce what he was to produce as the name of Abram so God changed his name to Abraham to match the character of what was on the inside of him oh come on that's why chain saw PA's name to Paul was because he had to put he had a character on the inside of him that was not matching up with the name that he was currently in so he changed his name and before you ever heard your name called I'm preaching before you ever heard your name called you had the character of a bride on the inside of you so he changed your name and he don't call you Church no more he called you bride because you got the bride kind of a love oh blessed be the name of the Lord they can have it they can look like it but your name matches the love what was it in that woman up there in John 4 what was it something was on the inside of her that made him draw towards her I want you to look at this and go to Genesis chap 24 and you look at these two women that are at a well when you look at Rebecca she's sitting there look what is the drawing attraction it's the whale it's deep and they're there for a purpose they're both thirsty they're both doing their jobs but they each meet a man at a wh where' he find you at is when you were thirsting for him he drawed you he called you he elected you you didn't come to God God came to you elaser tell me more about my Isaac tell me about him tell me how he loves me tell me what he done for me tell me how he died for me elaser tell me more tell me more one's a prostitute one's a virgin but the same caliber of a man is sitting at the well one with the power to change her from a prostitute to a virgin Hallelujah he saw something in that prostitute that drawed him to her Rebecca didn't even know what she was doing Whitney she had no idea what she was doing but she was literally matching the prayer of the Prophet messenger when she stepped out there and he said now Lord I want you to send me a virgin I want you to send me a woman that'll be that will match the caliber of My Father Abraham and he prays all of these prayers how did how did she match the vision of what elaser prayed it was because God had already saw her and he put the desire on the inside of William brandham to say the right kind of thing that would draw the right kind of a lady come on somebody if he was preaching Billy Graham or or Roberts he'd have called for money he'd have called for this he'd have called for thousands but he wasn't calling for them he was calling for a rainbow trout kind of people because you're that kind of a people you're a golden you're a golden age kind of people you're a golden age you're a covenant kind of people the messenger knew what he was called call in for Lord don't let her just water me but let her water the power that'll take her in a Rapture let her water it Lord and when she came there when she came there she said I'll he said will you draw me a little bit of water and when he Jesus is standing there and said will you give me something to drink watch what draw them together she said not only will I draw for you but I will draw for your 10 cels it said that a Thirsty Camel that has went as far as these camels went can drink 30 gallons of water 30 time 10 300 gallons of water the Well's deep but she's got something on the inside of her there's a supernatural strength when everybody else would have gave up Rebecca still whirling sir Rebecca she'll saying amen when everything ain't going right for her Rebecca standing there at the well because she knows there's a power she knows there's a power that will lead her to her Isaac and when everybody else is walking away and when nobody else is loving the word Rebecca's still pulling on that power she didn't know what she was doing but she was in love all that time Hallelujah and sometimes it don't make sense sometimes it don't make sense to be pers but love faileth not love don't give up love believes all things hopes in all things that's the kind of love that Rebecca had over 60 trips dropping the bucket in and getting it back out do you have what it takes do you have what it takes to fight like David's Mighty Men when all hope is gone when everybody else is surrounding you and threatening your king do you have that kind of love for your king that you'll fight through 800 Philistines that you'll fight through 15 miles of philistine armies to bring him a fresh drink of Pentecostal water do you love him that much when your wife don't want to love him you still love him when your children Don't Want To Praise Him you still praise him do you love him that much when the doctors give up do you love him that much hallelujah what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying that the 11th commandment is Supernatural what was it when that Maniac when that Maniac ran at him and all them preachers were fearful all of them was fearful some of them was calling for police officers he said but oh no this is a battle this is a spiritual warfare brother mam said I found this amazing brother Chris he said I didn't hate the man he said because it wasn't the man he said that man had a good family had a good home he said but it was the devil on the inside of that man that hated me he said so instead of hating him I loved him do you have the kind of love that you can walk past a homosexual spirit and love the person that it's on but hate the spirit that's behind it remember these people that come against this message these people that criticize truth these people that are filled with demon power they're people like you you I preach to me the message brother Andrew I am I'm preaching his hard as I can do you have that kind of love I'm going tell you right now it makes every red blooded male here when two men are sitting there kissing on each other make you sick to your stomach but you don't hate that man how about when you do with an atheist how about when you're dealing with a muhamad how about when you're dealing with a Buddhist do you have the kind of love of Jesus do you have that kind of love and said father forgive them for they know not what they do I didn't hate him I loved him that's the kind of love that God projects it takes a real man to handle rejection anybody can handle being accepted we got we got kids right here in this church that are literally right now being bullied in their in their school for for believing what you believe they're they're literally being pushed around for dressing holy for living holy and I commend these young people for standing up for what's right no matter if they bully you around or make fun of you God bless you ain't no child deserves to be rejected but it shows what value that you have when you can stand rejection he's telling the brothers in the back it's powerful how valuable that you are is that the the messenger literally stood the rejection of The ecumenical move and the church councils he allowed them to reject him when William brandham did nothing but love them that I'll tell you right now when you you start studying love you can match William brandom's life to love I don't care what critic you come up against there ain't nobody I'll be honest I'm still working on me we talking about it in the back that time that brother brother Brandon was standing out there and they the man calls him out comes out before and brother Brandon was supposed to preach and supposed to preach and the man gets up there and say well brother Brandon wasn't able to come brother Brandon standing right back there behind that curtain said brother brandham had some prior engagements and he wasn't able to come brother Bisal said i' have stepped right on out there brother brother Bram said oh I couldn't have done that brother Eddie brother Ed said that's right there right there when I figured out I was not called to be the prophet I'm going to tell you right now there's some things I'm still working on because I've been in fields when killer BS well I thought they was going to kill me anyway got out there and thought I was a Bronco and thought I'd be somebody cool and get out there with Popa Charlie's black anguses and meanor in a junkyard dog and cuz they had an infection in them they typically wasn't that way but man they got stinking mean Papa Charlie said oh he won't hurt you he won't hurt you that dude that dude stood up about broke that fence down me hit me right in the face don't tell me I still working on perfect love brother Jonathan I be honest I didn't love him right there that minute if IID had a pistol I'd probably shot him I'll be honest with you you won't ever make a God out of me I still got some things I got to work on my brother R said instead of hating that boy I love him instead of hating them Hornets I love them when them dudes buckle you up in the shoulder and roll you upside down a hill and you rolling down 48 48 pil of Road you don't feel like love right there at that moment that's power that's real power Powerful Love is that when you can stand there and say forgive me I didn't mean to disturb your nest just going back here there's some things we still going to work on brother Chester we're going to work on that he's still working but to think that the prophet literally showed the love of God that he would allow the church world to reject him to show the love that God has for you because the Sheep had to pull away from the genuine seat the shuck had to pull away from it because God had to allow the rejection to prove his exception of you let me let me go on down here I'm closing musicians come God said in Isaiah 49:15 can a woman forget her suckling child that she shall not have compassion on the son of her womb yay they may forget yet I will not forget you that's love love produces Faith love produces confidence it don't have it ain't got fear in it notice what brother Brandon says and God come down in that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love look what you was and look what you are what did that somebody that loved you can you have faith in what he's promised you then real genuine love will create will create a confidence in his word if God when I was an alien from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he's seen something in you he had a reason to save you look at the peoples that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have took beside you but he took you amen no one can take your place amen you're in God's economy no one can do it that's his love to you then won't you love won't Your Love reach right back to him and there's a love affair that no matter what the situation is it circumstances is governed by this love that creates faith that God loves you and you love God and you love one another and that brings the faith then it can't keep from bringing out exactly what God promised it would do that's perfect faith is pure why brother Ron stay here this week is because God loved him so much he had a purpose in saving him and I got notes all around this world all around the world I tell you when you want to find out how much Somebody Loves You just get sick one time it's amazing the kind of love people love our pastor they really love him they see something genuine in him brother Chris I know there's a whole lot of I know there's a whole lot of mistakes and a whole lot of man there that are out there in the world but we got a real Pastor somebody that we can somebody that we don't lift up and make a God but we got somebody that we can admire and have faith in but he had confidence in him that he could send him through it and I was hearing from all the world I thought this is amazing brother Joel all over all over Europe all over all over New Zealand Australia all over us and people were saying from Ireland even they're saying I never feared one time because I knew God had something left for brother Ron to do perfect love cast out fear well perfect faith is pure just as pure as love is and when you love somebody you love your husband and you love your wife now there's no need of anybody telling you that you don't do it because you do it and you know you do it you think I could talk Jeff out of saying he don't love you I don't think I could you think I could talk Katie out I don't think anybody could cuz ain't nobody else she had to be crazy to love somebody like me ain't it amazing that when you there's been some moments in my life I have embarrassed her the first year of our our marriage I probably embarrassed her more than anything else it wasn't by stupid mistakes that I did out in public it was was because something wasn't right here but she didn't give up on me she wore me out brother Timothy she wore me out in prayer man she she'd stay up all night i' to get up next morning at 4:00 in the morning she'd be having a prayer meeting God have mercy I got to go to bed but she loved me because something on the inside of her saw something valuable before I ever seen it she loved me even when I didn't look like the product that she was wanting as a husband she loved me when I didn't match the description but there was somebody working don't give up on the people that don't match the picture don't give up on them because they don't match what God's love is don't you give up on them don't give up don't give up don't give up well this person hurt me that person said something that person let me down don't you give up upon them because pure love has pure faith that God will see it through there's no need of anybody telling me that I don't love her because I love her and there ain't no need of any devil trying to talk me out of I'm not going in a Rapture because I know I'm going in a Rapture there's no need of no devil trying to raise up and tell me that I can't have the Holy Ghost because I know I got it there's there no need of any skeptic devil trying to shut us down it's because I love him you can't tell me I don't love him I love him because he first loved me by this shall all men know that you're my disciples when you love one or another what you saying to us brother be the kind of love that expresses God's love I think that's something very powerful about brother Ron is that he can meet a stranger and there's many of men that we know but brother Ron's probably inFAMOUS or famous for this I mean I don't know if that's the right word to use right there or not but anyways he can literally meet anybody he can be on a cruise ship and people fall in love with the man he could be in a gas station and people just want to be with him what is that literally what it what what's the drawing power of that it's the love of God people get so MX stood I've heard sister say I don't know how to take brother on he said he loved me he ain't talking that kind of love you'd be some kind of idiot to think that kind of thing there's some idiots out there I wonder when he says I love you I love you buddy what is say that's the kind of love that God ex expresses out love is Lac throughout all the message I'm way over time but I'm I'm I'm done I'm moving on from this thought I'm going somewhere else tomorrow so let me Express this to you love is laced right into the third pole because when brother bandham comes and Christ The Mystery of God revealed he lays in there that this is God's expression of love he said that God and man could be one it was his expression of love and when he comes down to the end of it he says now go on and love one another and he goes into paragraph 637 and he says now you that are spiritual he said look at the clock it's 2:00 on the dot he eles love in the message of Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said it's a sign that the second pull is ended and that the third pole is at hand love is laced right into the message of the third pole what produced a king sword in this generation love God bless you do you love me do you love one another do you love one another do you really love your neighbor do you really love him really love him you don't want to see nobody go to hell but this kind of love is not the kind of love that you just I love him because I want to escape hell you love him that even if he would send you to a devil's hell you still love him that's real love God bless you tonight oh Sal [Music] oh over Tre oh I I love
