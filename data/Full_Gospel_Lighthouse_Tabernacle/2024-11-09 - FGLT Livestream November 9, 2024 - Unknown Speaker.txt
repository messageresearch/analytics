TRANSCRIPT
========================================
a way to worship amen and worship in vain that's why the Bible said the whole Earth would worship the mark of the beast except those who have their names in the Lamb's Book of Life see because it would be such a deceptive age and it would be a religious age and everybody's going to be worshiping amen so we find out that God then has got mercy and Grace to be able to un give us an understanding or he would be able to bring something to us that we wouldn't have to presume now I I think that's a powerful thing that if God is the one that's going to be worshiped he was the one that teach us how to worship and certainly that God Amen has a way in that he brings his word is he brings it through prophets now according to Amos the thir chapter and the seventh verse the Bible teaches us that God would do nothing until first he reveals it through his servant the prophet amen and that that teaching is not just in the Book of Amos but that was coming from what what Moses taught in the book of Deuteronomy if you're a Bible reader in Deuteronomy the 18th chapter it was uh in this time that God had appeared under the children of Israel and he had did it in a great fire and quaking and the people were fearful and they went to Moses and they said Lord don't speak to us like that anymore don't don't ask God to not talk to us like that but but but to do it some other way and when they did that Moses went unto the Lord and he come back and told the people God has honored your prayer and he has said to thee that God would raised up a prophet from the midst of ye and he would do it liken unto me and him shall ye hearken unto and according to all that thou desirest the Lord thy God in horor in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God Deuteronomy 18:16 and neither let me see this great fire anymore that I die not and the Lord said unto me thou have well spoken that which they have spoken and I will raise them up a prophet among the Brethren like unto thee and I will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them and that I shall command him and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name I require it of him and but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which I have not commanded him to speak or he shall speak in the name of other gods even that Prophet shall die and in thou say in thine heart how shall we know how shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken and when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass the thing which the Lord hath not spoken that Prophet has spoken presumptuously and thou shalt not be afraid of him amen and thou shalt not be afraid of him because what presumption means is to speak without Authority in other words amen you you've seen an entire age of it when men uh speak like they speak for God but they're not speaking for God because what they say don't come to pass so it's a presumptuous speaking and God said you don't have to fear that man see but we find out that that's presumption is not the order of the worship of the bride of Christ you you see God is not requiring us to Worship in a place that we don't know what we're worshiping if God requires of a man to worship he is also obligated to make him own self known that you would be worshiping God and not worshiping the devil now watch what he tells us in Acts the thir chapter the Bible tells us that the Lord God he said s shall send Jesus Christ which was before preached unto you and the heavens must receive him until the time of the restitution of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of the holy prophet since the world began and for Moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the Lord God rais up unto your brethren liken unto me and him shall you hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you how many realizes that Jesus Christ is a prophet amen that Jesus Christ is a prophet now I got to say this very clearly amen he's not only a prophet he is the prophet amen he's not only see you can go back and you can see when David prophesied he was typing Christ and when Moses prophesied he was typing Christ and and and when you see how that Isaiah was prophesying he was typing Christ amen but Isaiah was not Jesus and and Moses was not Jesus and David was not Jesus they only typed him amen but when Jesus came he was not a type of David he was the Fulfillment of what David was typing so the god of Abraham and the god of David and the god of Moses and the god of Isaiah amen he was the god of the prophets he was the prophet of all prophets amen the Bible teaches us that the Lord Our God shall raise a prophet like it unto thee now what does that mean it means that God would raise Jesus Christ and he would bring him out of the scriptures so when Jesus came he was not a self-proclaimed prophet he wasn't because a group said he was a prophet it's because he was a fulfillment of the scriptures that was pointing to the generation that he was living in amen that a prophet should come out of this now I say that because people say to me all the time said well there's no such thing as prophets in the last day and if you've ever talked to someone and you tell them well we PR a prophetic message in the end time mostly what they want to say is a false prophet that's all people know about these days is false prophets that's all they talk about whether the Antichrist he'll be a false prophet well how do you have a false one without having a real one amen how do you have a bogus $100 bill unless you got a real $100 bill and the only reason they're going to fake being a prophet is because a prophet has Authority and he sets the the order amen of the of the very thing that God has required of the people to bring worship unto that church now look at the power this when Jesus comes he was a prophet so somebody said well the law and the prophets were under John well Jesus was after John was he not amen wasn't Jesus after John and he was the prophet of all prophets he fulfilled the law of the prophets but let me say this that Prophet Jesus never died amen I know they put him in a tomb but he rose up on the third day and that's why the Bible says in the Book of Revelations that our testimony is the testimony of Jesus Christ which is the spirit of Prophecy the very spirit that beats in your heart tonight as a Christian is the spirit of Prophecy amen Jesus himself is the prophet amen and he comes into the church now now we do not have to be confused tonight amen about the order of worship and what God has designed for this generation when I say that because it's an age of confusion I don't have time to preach on the age of confusion but but just know it's an age of confusion and I'll say this it's so confusing men don't know whether they're men and women don't know if they're women they don't know what bathroom they don't know what kind of clothes to wear they don't know if they're cats or they're humans or amen why it's because of the confusion and the confusion began in religion and religion ended up in perversion and the whole world Amen is worshiping the devil because of confusion on religion well I thank God tonight that we don't have to live in confusion but we've got a word that has come from God and is sent back the church in the power of the Holy Ghost yes we believe in prophets go ahead and finish the scriptures if you're going to quote them amen the law and the prophets were until John but what after that come on what after that after that is the kingdom of God that's why Hebrews chapter 1 it said that God spoke to the prophets in various times but in the last days he would speak through his son Jesus Christ who is the prophet of all prophets that's why the Bible said in Luke 17 and the 30th verse that he would reveal himself as the son of man in the last days amen because we do not have to be confused about worship he was to tell us these things Hallelujah Divine Authority would return to the church in the last days in John the 4th chapter if you want to read it with me it let's start in the third verse and he left Judea and departed again unto Galilee amen and he said he has needs to go to Samaria then he come to a city of Samaria which is called Saar it's near to the partial of ground that Jacob had gave his son Joseph and Jacob's Well was there now I want you to notice the Bible said he went to Samaria now if you're if you're a studier at all of geography amen Samaria wasn't on the way amen he had to go out out of the way to go to Samaria and most nobody wanted to go through Samaria as a Jew because the Samaritans were rejects of the Jewish race because they were a mixed up lot they were a mixed breed and they had their own kind of worship amen and most of the Israelites didn't fool with the Samaritans but but Jesus said I have a need to go buy Samar how many knows why he had to go there amen because there was a woman he was going to meet on that well amen and that woman wasn't just any other church it was an ordained and predestinated woman that had something in her that would recognize him when the whole world was going to recognize him they were going to call him be elub they were going to calling the devil they were going to make fun of his prophetic Ministry amen but there was a little woman sitting there amen who was a reject of the very world she was in and she had a need so he went there can I just say it real plain that when Jesus is on his way to the Jews in his return he goes by the way of the Gentiles this Gentile bride is out of his way but there's a need in the Gentile church for the Messiah to come to us before he makes it to the Jews and I thank God tonight amen that I am a representative amen I was the woman on the well amen and he had a need to come by my well I wonder tonight if you got a need for him to come by your well do you know he's still alive tonight that same Jesus that walked by that well he can walk right into this church tonight he can walk right into these pews tonight and he can deal with your heart and make you aware he is the same Jesus he is alive amen he's the same God now look at what he was doing here the Bible said he came to this Jacob's Well and Jesus being wear with his journey set th on the well and it was about the sixth hour then he cometh unto a woman of Samaria to draw water and Jesus said unto her give me a drink the disciples were gone so it were just him and her and then saith the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that being a Jew ask a drink of me which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings so she goes to the Civil Rights Movement we're going to go to the Prejudice I'm a I'm a colored person and you're a white man now listen do you think it's an accident when Willam br was on the earth in the 60s that it was the greatest civil rights movement in the all of the history of the world Amen there was race rots Martin Luther King Jr it was an entire race battle going on when he was on the earth amen and here is race at that well she's talking about well I'm a Jew you're a Jew I'm a Samaritan amen so immediately race become an issue amen and here we are again with a prophet in the last day with race rights and race issues and Jesus uh said unto her now here's the thing for the woman saith unto him how is it thou being a Jew asked me which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews had no dealing with the Samaritans and Jesus said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who is that saith unto thee give me a drink thou would have have asked him and he would have given thee Living Water amen now it's powerful because here's this woman amen and she's very thirsty amen but she don't know because the woman saith unto her him sir thou Hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from which thou H has living water and art thou greater than our father Jacob yeah amen are you greater than him that gave us this well and drank thereof and his children and his cattle and Jesus said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him he shall never thirst again but the water that I shall give unto him shall be a well of water springing up into everlasting life and the woman says oh if there's water like that sir give me a drink amen if there's some water tonight that'll take The Thirst out of the Soul give me some of that you because you know really what it is what humans really thirst for they thirst for a living God they thirst to know God's Alive we thirst to know he's not just the god of the Bible or he's the god of a history l or is the god that lived when our parents or our grandparents needed him but is he alive tonight amen are you thirsty to know tonight then there's a water tonight amen if there's a thirst there's an answer because God is rich in Mercy makes himself known to that heart and it brings forth the desire of that well look what she says sir I want some of that water that's what I want some of that water y'all know he's talking about the Holy Ghost amen he just said it it would spring up out of you that's exactly the prophecy of the Holy Ghost shall come out of thee like flowing like rivers of water out of thy bellies and she's being told the Holy Ghost is the water I got for you come on that's the water that come out of the Rock Amen in the desert was the Holy Ghost it was the water they should have got when they spoke to The Rock was the Holy Ghost and let me say this unless you're willing to receive the Holy Ghost you will never quench The Thirst of the human heart but here was a man that could tell her what would answer the depths of her soul oh I tell you I tell you a powerful thing sir give me this water neither come hither to draw Jesus said go call th husband now we're going to teach marriage and divorce look at this now marriage and divorce comes into issue automatically and you know what we find out from this we found out this woman's in shape she's in such a bad shape amen that there's no fixing what she's in there's no fixing what she's in in the church there's no fixing what she's in through the Pharisees there's no fixing what she's in through the religion of her age amen but here's one amen that has a higher thought here is something that's outside religion here is something that's outside the situation she's in and that's really what you got to come in contact with folks you got to get in contact with something that's higher than you do you see that woman was in God's mind before the foundation of the world and the Pharisee couldn't lift her that high and religion couldn't lift her that high but here come one that could take the lowest of lows it take in the middle of a marriage and divorce case and could lift her back in the presence of God he could set her soul of fire when she throw down her bucket and went running come see a man I'll tell you what he could do he could he could Hey listen he didn't say okay listen and you're all messed up in your marriage I got to go now look folks heyen this is the prophet what he did for thou Hast had five husbands and whom thou havest Nots not thine own and thou said us this truly and the woman said unto her him sir I perceive thou art a prophet isn't that powerful I perceive thou are a prophet now watch this because immediately in seeing that he was a prophet I mean immediately the next verse our fathers worshiped in this mountain now she's going to talk about worship we got a prophet now let's talk about worship he worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship and Jesus said unto Heroman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this Mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the father you worship you know not what we know what we worship salvation is of the Jew but the hour cometh and now is now watch the separation of this there's two Ministries the hour cometh and now is there is the Ministry Jesus now he was talking to her at the well but there's another hour coming there's another son of man Ministry coming in the future the hour cometh but now is is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in the spirit and Truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him amen it does not say the true worshippers worship the father and truthfully speakest and God is a spirit and they that worship him now watch the 24th verse they might Worship in the spirit and truth no that that's a that's a direct word they must see because there is now a definite understanding of how to worship God they must worship see because people's been worshiping but it's been in vain but now he's saying if you want to worship it's not going to be on this mountain and it's not going to be in Jerusalem but you must worship God in the spirit and Truth Now now can I can I give a little history here amen if you get a little history of the Samaritan some people actually believe the Samaritans to be the original 10 lost tribes if you ever heard about the 10 tribes remember God separated Israel they had 12 tribes 12 sons of Jacob and they divided them in two tribes and 10 tribes and two of the tribes became Judea which stayed with Jerusalem because of God's promise to David that there would be a seed remain upon the throne so they stayed in Jerusalem but there were 10 tribes that became what you know as Israel and whenever the scripture talks about Nebuchadnezzar coming and carrying away Judah he carried away them at Jerusalem and tore down the temple but the ones that were carried away in Israel were Carri cared Away by the Assyrian army and they were carried in now that's what they talk about the 10 L tribes because they never did see a restoration of Israel the 10 lost tribes well they believe that some of the people from them 10 tribes I don't know if this is 100% accurate this is what they believe but those 10 lost tribes mingled with the heathens and some of them people were half Jew and half Gentile and they called them Samaritans now brother BR teaches us half Jew and half Samaritan so what they did is they had part of the word amen because they were Jews but then there was part of them that had been lost in that time and didn't keep up with the word uh they actually now even today I mean they have it recorded the Samaritan religion itself only has the first five books of of Moses how many how many realizes that the Samaritan just had the first five books of Moses so in other words they had the pen pentatonic of the Bible if you take the first five books of your Bible that's what this woman at the whale had she didn't have amen the the the the time of the Kings and Samuel and Ezra and Nehemiah and she didn't have all those things so in the first few books of the Bible of course Mount gersam was a mountain of blessing which this Jacob's Well was at the foot of Mount gersam where where where Moses had said come from that mountain and put a blessing on the children of Israel but see she didn't have the book of kings and she didn't know that God had used David to move the Ark of the Covenant into Jerusalem and Jerusalem had come the place of worship now it wasn't she wasn't a sincere worshipper she just didn't have all the word amen see what it was she she read up to about 1955 and she never got 1963 she that's the reason she was preaching the prophet had to come back and had Tent Revival and and that's the reason they're teaching all these other things is because they never went into the rest of the word they're good believers they just ain't got the whole message do you see that amen and while they're standing there Jesus is the word he he is the word he is the original word and he's telling her listen there's coming a time it now is and coming that you ain't going to worship like that now what he's doing now is he's setting the order do you see what she says now you Jews say it's Jerusalem amen and they had all the word so it's you Jews are saying that you just teach the word and that's what we're going to need and but us Samaritans say that you just get in the spirit and God will make up for the difference amen and here's a prophet saying no no no you can't just have the spirit and no you can't just have the truth these two have to come together oh Church of the Living God you've got to bring the anointing on the word amen the very word that the Pharisees were reading caused them to crucify Jesus Christ you can't just have the word only you've got to have the spirit that's in the word that it helps you discern the difference between good and evil look at what they do they were rejecting their very Messiah but they were doing it because they didn't have the inspiration on the word of God that's why today people reject the message of the hour amen they reject it because they don't see the inspiration on the word of God Amen when I look at this it says God is a spirit amen I tell you what a revelation to that woman God is a spirit Jesus is breaking the word to her now God is a spirit you got to get that right God is a spirit he not a man come on he's God is a spirit Jesus was the man declaring the spirit but God first is the spirit so how you going to worship a spirit until you get in the spirit you got to get in the spirit to worship The God Who is in the spirit look at what he said and hey man I I love this portion this next portion she says I know the Messiah so now she's tying together a prophet like Moses is the Messiah they were expecting to come and they knew that the Messiah was going to set the order of worship hadn't it already been prophesied there would come an end to their daily sacrifices hadn't it already been told how that there would come a new thing and change and there will be an hour amen but but who was it that set up the Tabernacle Moses who told them how to Camp Moses who told them how to need their bread and how how to walk and how to order their tents and who told them how to put the cups in this place and veil in this place and put the ark over here and put the word Moses ordered the worship and they knew there was coming somebody like Moses and here Jesus was standing there now and he was saying we have come to the end of the Ark of Moses we have come to the end of the laws and we have come to the end of Jerusalem being the place of worship oh but if you want to worship God you can worship Him in America you can worship Him in Africa you can worship him all over the world as long as you get in the spirit you're able to get in the presence of God and you can worship Him amen you don't have to worship God in any certain church I love that God gave us that Revelation You Don't Have To Worship in a certain church I know the Baptist taught us when we left their churches we were going to die and go to hell Pentecostal told us if your name on our book you ain't going to go in the Rapture well there's teachers raised up in the last days if you don't hear me preach you can't go in the Rapture well let me tell you I got my own books I got my own tapes and as long as I can get in the spirit I can find a place to worship brother I can worship in the middle of my trials in the middle of my troubles in the middle of confusion because the spirit of God has been restored in the last days for the church to worship Him who is God he is a spirit how can you worship him until you get in the spirit Jesus had come to prove amen he proved to the people the scriptures he was the Messiah they had looked to come amen but how many of them had their conceptions of him but refused him when he came Jesus didn't come contrary to scripture he come contrary to their teachings the Messiah God didn't come contrary to scripture he came contrary to their teachings and even though he proved by scripture who he was they wouldn't accept the scripture on his life they said well that don't apply to him and that don't apply to him and that don't apply to him and so they would dismiss the scripture so that they could they could reject the Fulfillment of the word Messiah of course had to be a prophet we know the Messiah would be a prophet because of the attributes that followed him do you recognize that God has Supernatural characteristics that's how you recognize God if you you some of you guys in here some of you deer hunters you open this for me it's some of you deer hunters that are in here uh if you ever been out west and seen a mule deer thank you you ever seen a mu deer they don't run like a white tail deer and if you're standing around there you see a you see a mu deer get up you better know the difference because they look a lot alike till they start running am man a white tail he gets low and throws his tail and he's gone but that mu deer hoop like a it it'll hop like a bunny rabbit I mean four-legged hop funniest looking thing amen they're funny looking you seen them it's characteristic of it somebody said somebody said uh well that's a bird what kind of bird was it a red bird you know is it a blue bird it's a bird but what kind and there's a characteristic to God and that characteristic is Supernatural God God is always Supernatural God is always Supernatural cuz he can be he is God so it sets him apart that's the reason when he opened the Red Sea brother R they asked him said he said why do you think why do you think that God had him up the Red Sea like that and and brother B said because God said I'll deliver thee with a mighty hand not Moses he said so God put him in impossible position to identify it was doing the leading and sometimes you get in positions and you say well why am I in this because the supernatural God wants you to know that it's not your pastor doing it it's not one thing it's one day you say well you know this is happening or that's happening or this has happen but here's a prophet now that told a woman 17 different definite things about her life amen I remember brother Ed he counted them I think I've seen you do that amen sat there and counted them amen talk about talk to one woman and talk to her and said I see you laying on the table and I see the doctor he's got I think your kidney in his hand amen come on Amen nobody told him those things amen what was it it was a messiah sign to take you beyond doubt because the Rapture will be a perfect faith it took us Beyond questioning whether it was true or not but it took us in a realm of reality beyond anything a man could think or anything because he was going to declare himself to be the Messiah now have you ever wondered why Jesus showed himself to the woman at the well because there was no scripture pointing to the Gentiles so brother Bram said what he done is he picked the woman at the well he said because she was a mixed race like you Gentiles and she was a harlot so being a mixed raced Harlot he said it was a type of woman at that it was a type of the end time church so the prophecy of him coming to her then was a forecast that he would come to her in the last days see when God chooses what he's going to do amen there's something you find out about God he is an unchanging God with unchanging ways so when you see him do something a certain way you know he's going to do it that way again amen I remember years ago amen I took a little thought on this was really working on Prophecy and and you can look and see amen sometimes it's through the life of Prophecy is what shows prophecy it's not always written but I was standing with my father-in-law we were standing out in a in a field he's he's got this uh Martin box up and he puts this Martin box and he sees this little little Martin fly in there and he said to me he said well there's the he said there's the Scout he said the rest of them be along after a while I said well how do you know that he said cuz they did that last year and you know what they do that every year amen you know what why they do that is because God is in them and he's an unchanging God with unchanging ways and that nature of them do that so if God was poting out now the depths of that I don't have time to preach to you but I'll say this somebody said well to Hey Brother Wayne are are you are you talking about God coming in the church in the last day and I say yeah and people will say well how in the world would he ever use me because he's already chose you what do you mean do you believe that Jesus was virgin born of course he was he was a virgin born born son of God according to the Book of Romans to the to the flesh he was of David and of the spirit he was the son of God and and and and look at Jesus when he picked his family lineage he could have picked anybody but he picked basheba amen and he picked Rahab and he picked Tamar and and you say why why would God pick them because he was picking you he already picked you when he picked them amen you said well God can't use me can he he already has he descended through 42 generations and he came through Tamar and he came through basba and he come through Rahab showing that in the last days he would descend again into this generation and he would use men and women brother do you see amen that that mixed up Gentile amen was the only only class left that he hadn't showed himself to but today he was showing himself to the Messiah was being shown to the church somebody say well brother Wayne are you saying the messiah's here I'm saying the messiah's here I'm saying the messiah's here I'll say this William Brandon was not the Messiah he said but the Messiah was talking through him amen if you're expecting to see the Messiah the East and the West have come together the same son that was in the East is here in the west and they have come together I'll say this to you the Messiah is still alive can I say it the Messiah is still alive brother R said it like this he discerned a person he said now if you'll believe me he said then you would have to admit the Messiah is still alive he said now you're responsible to go tell somebody else the Messiah is alive we have found the Messiah we are not looking for him we have found him oh it's a big difference church if you're looking for the answer or if you have the answer if you're looking for the answer can I just point out to you she never asked no more questions she said he told me all things he didn't tell her all things but he let her know she was talking to the Messiah and it answered her little heart I'll tell you this she ran she ran into the City and said come see a man and many were converted because of her testimony I'll tell you this she was a harlot without a voice but she was so influenced by the Messiah side that she became influential and led people to Christ let me say tonight I don't care if you're a widow woman I don't care if you're a little teenage girl you get under the influence of this message and you can lead people to Christ and you can lead people to the Holy Ghost and you can lead people to truth because the influence of this message is so real and so powerful you can set here tonight take your life and begin to surrender to this and influence will come into your life she didn't ask any more questions cuz she didn't have any more questions it was proven beyond the shadow of a doubt and if this is the Messiah the prophet of God I I'll just give you a couple direct quotes as we go along he said he here he is he came to those Shepherds with the greatest message that had ever been given to anybody the messiah's on earth now and he said so is it here he comes with the greatest message and what is the message the Messiah is here now and and to make known do you see the Messiah is here now he's here working through flesh be not afraid he said I'm not the Messiah no other man is the Messiah he is the Messiah but his Spirit dwells in US amen the Messiah not me I'm a man but his Spirit the same anointing that you feel is the Same Spirit that's talking he said it's through the gift Amen in the voice of the sign he said the word has been promised has been made manifest the the Messiah Christ of God is in divine presence somebody said well I want to see the nail scars and the print of thorns Amen in the Millennium you'll see that body but here tonight that wasn't the promise he never promised to come Among Us in the last days in that body he promised we would meet that body he promised we would be lifted to that body amen but he didn't promise nail scars he promised the word of God would become manifest and I say tonight if you're looking for the Messiah if you'll look by the words you'll see him he's right here in the building tonight he's still just as alive as he's ever been listen our God is not dead he is not dead folks he is not in a tomb in Jerusalem he's not in a tomb in Jeffersonville he is the same Jesus right here in this building tonight that he's ever been he is still alive he is still alive he is still real oh I could pray this this morning the same Messiah is here in the Forum of the Holy Ghost now that answers it don't it he's here in the form of the Holy Ghost don't you think John the Baptist pointed him out when he was here and he pointed him out the same as Elijah of this day pointed him out amen now if you can if you see that it's the Messiah then you're going to hear the message differently you're going to hear it differently it's not just a book that you pull down to compare your thought to it's not a commentary that you take your thought and you use this book and use Adam Carton and use William brandom and then you use amen it's not that folks this is the messiah's message and it has come to set the church in its place for the Rapture in the last days this is the highest Authority there is in the land amen and this Authority told us how to worship God if you hear it you hear it different now look brother Bram said it he said the English word God he said that word was the object of worship and he said if you maybe take that speaker you could worship it or you could take this pull pit or you could take your car amen because the English word God would just mean an object you worship but when a Prophet come along he said in the beginning was the word he said now what was before that Hallelujah I like that don't you now what was before that he said you got to see the word God in Hebrew means Elohim which means a self existing one and he existed without anything and before he wasn't even God now that's going back ain't it you're going back to the place before he was worshiped but when he created something he created it to worship Him the Lord's day somebody asked me said brother Wayne what do you think that means do you think John was just meditating or do you think John was just caught in the spirit of Revelation well we got a message see what the prophet said about it not what I think about it what the prophets say about it I'll tell you what brother Ram said about it he said John was out there on that island shouting and dancing and running all over the place amen and you say well what in the world brother man said because he was in the spirit he said and if God did that in Acts two we can only imagine John was under the same spirit that they were in Acts the 2 chapter when the spirit fell upon him now I wonder why brother brandham knew that because William brandham had himself been in the spirit a couple times and he'd been running around up there in Revelation around that stone up there in the middle of the mountains and begin to worship God shouting and dancing and rejoicing you know why because they that worship God must worship Him in spirit and in truth he say brother what in the world let me say this to you God ends one thing and opens up another we have long past the days of intellectual learning the Church of the Living God brother said it like this we have let the phenomena go he said and God went with it he said we brought education in the church and God can't stand education so he goes out with a phenomena I pray to God tonight that we never get rid of the phenomena of God coming down in the middle of a church house and changing lives and bringing heart listen I I love good teaching but it don't mean nothing till you get in the spirit there ain't nothing means nothing until you get in the spirit of God and and then when you get in the spirit of God oh the teaching oh brother Bram said it like this get in the spirit and then and then things look different get in the spirit then things look different if you're sitting here tonight and you can't see any Escape get in the spirit things will look different you've read the scripture and you know that God Will Make A Way of Escape you've read the scripture you know that but if you get in the spirit of God amen it'll be real to you now when When God says get in the spirit we we've in this last days we've got everybody we've got everybody telling us try to how to worship we got everybody telling us everybody's dictating to us we got so many popes and Bishops and and dictators and authorites and amen here a while back we had a pope of Music rise up and tell us what kind of music we can play and sing and somebody's going to rise up and tell us when we can shout when we can shou and somebody else is going to tell us but the Messiah was to tell us these things listen amen Unity comes when we have the same boss amen but I I hey look I grew up in a household of five kids amen I took it good from Daddy but don't let brother tell me amen amen I'd say right quick I I I would tell I'd tell my brother you ain't my mama amen and I tell you what this last day I want to tell some preachers you ain't my mama I was born of the spirit of God I was born in the power of God I was born in the reality of God listen I know I know somebody say well brother Wayne hey man I I tell you what now now we're talking about what the Messiah told us we're talking about what he talked to us about amen uh I know I know sometimes it's even a little issue about people standing up and shouting when you're preaching you know well I mean I can't help it people get energized when we preach it just good words good word you know makes you feel like getting up and if you want to look for scripture I'll read you something tomorrow but I'll tell you this amen but but but sometimes you get up there was a lady come to brother Brandon and she said brother Ram she said the other day you was preaching and she she was kind of new and she said I was a sitting in your service said the people was a shouting and rejoicing and they were rising up and saying amen and she said well man she said I felt just like doing that myself and brother B said why didn't you do it then and she said well about the time I started to she said the devil come sit on my shoulder and told me I wasn't worthy to do it brother B said Oh Sister he said that's when you ought have done it see he'll tell us how to do it if we'll listen to him when we don't feel like it we ought to do it amen when we're down in the dumps we ought to do it right then we ought to tell that devil you won't dictate to me when I worship and when I don't worship there ain't no church going to tell me when I worship or when I don't worship I will worship god with the dictates of my heart because he bought me and he saved me somebody said you're fanatical in your worship that's all right the way you call heresy is the way I worship the god of my fathers you wasn't there when he saved this boy you wasn't there when he gave me the Holy Ghost and pulled me out of the fire if he saved you the way he saved me oh you feel like I do when you think about the power and the realities of God now you tell that devil tonight you won't dictate My Worship I'll worship God according to the dictates of my heart I know some of you is in a battle I'm G to close I ain't goingon to preach y'all night I know some of You's in a battle and some of you get to wonder why you in this battle but you know what if you open your Bible sometimes there's a battle happening it's an unseen battle and because you can't see it the devil in darkness devil make it everything if you turn all these lights out and you come over here turn all the lights out and it's total darkness and you could just barely see this m standand he could say that mic stand's a lamp and he could say it's a stick and he could say oh that's a man he could say because in darkness you can say anything but turn the light on and you can see what it is and there's no more questions cuz it's in the light now amen and some of your battles you're going through when you're in the darkness of that battle Satan saying well you did this this and you did that and you did this and this is why this is and this is and because it's in darkness but the scripture brings light to us the scripture brings light you read the book of job and I'm I'm going to hurry but you look at the Book of Job and you see when devil wanted to tempt job he went to God and he said where you been he said I've been down there looking for somebody looking for somebody he said well have you tried job and the devil act like he didn't know who he was but he said well H you got a hedge buil around him so he knew name let me tell you one greater that God knew job's name and I'll tell you what when God knows your name I don't care what else is going on he knows me personally the god of Heaven picked me out of all the people on the Earth and said try my servant Wayne Lawson God Knows My Name personally amen and you know what he told that devil at devil said well I'll tell you why said you got a hedge buil around him but if you let me after him if you let me after after him he' curse you to your face you see what he did you see what the devil did he said that job's worship was so cheap that if just a few bad things would happen that job was turning his back on God he was telling God you're receiving worship only because you're making it good for him you got worship only because things are good you only got worship because this but look at what God told him he said I tell you what you going to do what you want to but he's a perfect man and he's got integrity and after you get done with him he'll still worship me and you know what calamity after Calamity after Calamity started striking job and as it started dring him and it wasn't bad enough it got all the way to his own wife and his own wife said you are to curse God how many knows who the wife was the Messiah said it was the flesh the word of God said it was of job's own flesh begin to accuse him amen and it begin to say to him you need to turn your back on God but in the middle of job's Calamity you know what he done he laid on the ground around and begin to worship God because he told that devil I do not have worship dictated by the kind of car I drive my worship is not dictated by the health of my body I will worship God because God remains to be God oh I'll tell you something tonight brother Ron I was wor I was I was preaching through that Ephesians and I got to Ephesians 5 and I seen a perfect church and I turned to Ephesians 6 and I seen Paul teach us about a battle a great battle was coming and I thought it was amazing he don't announce the battle until after he announced Perfection job's trial never started till God said here he is he's perfect and this great battle on the Church of the Living God did not begin until a prophet announced there was a perfect Bride on the earth until he said there was one on the earth now that's not like that first Eve amen there's another one on on the earth tonight have you tried my second Eve have you tried her have you worked on her have you took from her have you and let me say something tonight I don't care what he puts on us I don't care what kind of troubles come I don't care what kind of Trials come there's a bride on the earth tonight that will not give up her worship for God because she is a true worshipper in the spirit and in the truth stand to your feet with me tonight you see tonight in the darkness the devil can tell you anything he wants to tell you bring it to the light and then you're going to find out what your battle are about it's because God's been bragging on you God's been bragging on you he's been holding you up waving you around look at my perfect look at my perfect e this one ain't like that first one you will never persuade her differently look what's happening Perfection and when Perfection comes the battle comes and you might be sitting here in a battle tonight and the enemy's after your worship he's trying to turn you to worshiping something in this world trying to take and make an idol of some situation or some some worldly thing to turn your attention I tell you tonight you ought to turn Satan down flat you ought to tell him I'm not that kind of a woman that's you can come against me any way you want to I am still going to worship God he was to tell us these things I believe it I believe the Messiah I believe the Messiah has spoken in this age amen we're underneath that message tonight so where you going to worship him in the spirit and in the truth oh God is seeking such to worship tonight maybe you're here tonight and you've never really accepted the message with your whole heart maybe you're new here maybe you're just coming around a little bit and you've been looking it over we're not trying to preach to you William brandom we're trying to preach to you the promise that Jesus Christ would make himself known in the end time as being the God of this Bible and he's still that same God here tonight he's able to come right in this room right now and change the situations of your life maybe you want to surrender to it tonight said Lord I want I want to take it as my Elijah I want to take this message as my

was preaching and he was quoting brother Brandon where brother Brandon said you know he said I'd Le really let her have a little Wildfire is no fire and and Stephen he he gave us this funny example and he said now if you have Wildfire it can cool off he said but if you don't have no fire and he said so I like it on the power side he said you know when you're over there in that power side he said oops somebody got healed oops somebody got delivered when you're worshiping God no tell him what's about to happen I remember up in up in uh West Virginia brother Shrewsberry that was preaching up there one night we got to dancing in the spirit on the platform and brother Bobby vest was sitting in behind me and that Spirit was whipping I mean it was whipping through there and brother Bobby got up behind me man he started dancing right beside me and in a minute he just started screaming took off running out the back door running around the parking lot run back up on the platform and he said brother Wayne he said I've been suffering with a knee trouble for years he said and while I was dancing in that anointing God healed it right there in the middle of that worship you know you know some of you started out worshiping when you were when you were in depression when you in the middle anxiety you m some of the greatest struggles of your life and you didn't know how you was going to get
