remained one day a pharisee to jesus brought a woman in adultery caught that man walked away in the sand condemned but the woman's guilt was gone jesus stood for sinners that no one else would stand for then he stood at calvary when we thought he could stand no more in the days after jesus had gone away a man named stephen was full of faith but because of men who were full of hate he went on trial for his faith he fearlessly preached about the days of when the prophets their fathers laid and how they all rejected the holy ghost stephen gave his life that day and that's why we remember his name oh what will you be remembered for did you take a stand when you thought you could stand the are you in the rock what will you be remembered for paul joshua caleb and abraham enoch david if the list goes on will you find your name there what will you be remembered forget that god sent [Music] the us or in the sand are you going to show the world god sent amen and when they've met you will

amen let's just go to him in prayer this evening father we humbly approach you lord wholeheartedly we bow before your presence lord knowing that that you have entered lord where your children are worshiping lord david would say it that you would inhabit the praise of your people father i believe that sometimes it just kind of it takes our breath to think about that father to to think that when we go to lifting up holy hands and begin to lift up hands which gravity wants to hold down and lift up our voice it kind of catches us lord and makes us realize how powerful our praise is lord may we never take it for granted the the ability to worship you with the time that we've been given father i pray tonight that your holy spirit that we feel so near tonight lord i pray that you would work across this congregation tonight every every situation of life every everything that every person has been through this week i pray that that they could just leave a load here at the feet of jesus tonight lord i pray that you be mindful of every person lord that is streaming to this evening lord we we realize father that our hearts are are connected with so many people in different areas of life and different different places father but tonight i pray lord specifically for full gospel lighthouse i pray that you would pour out a blessing on those that are by the way of a phone hook up lord and the internet as well as the people that are sitting here under the sound of our voice tonight lord we know that that my voice won't do nothing for the people but it will be your voice that speaks through me father that that will speak to your children and and let them know that you love them that you're standing with them and you've not forgotten them and i pray that you would minister to them in a very special way lord i pray that you would take the words of life and just come into our our hearts lord and minister to us on a level that we would know that that was jesus speaking i come lord like the greeks came and they would say we would see jesus but they turned away because they could not see past the veil i pray you open our eyes this evening that we would see you oh we love you and appreciate you in jesus name amen if you have your bibles we'll turn over in the book of genesis chapter 4 and verse 1 and then first john chapter 4. genesis chapter four and then first john chapter four amen it's good to be in the house of the lord i'd like to speak to you this evening again on the thought on attached to the king attached to the king amen everybody happy this evening and wonderful amen the bible says here and adam knew his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have begotten a man from the lord and she again bear his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground and in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance failed first john chapter 4 and verse 1 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby we know that hereby know ye the spirit of god every every spirit that confesses that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god now notice there's a there's a two-letter word that you'll catch if if you're paying attention through this through this dialogue we read here this evening of of and it's a very very pertinent to our fault this evening but notice that hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is coming the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world ye are of god little children and have overcame them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they are of the world therefore they speak of the world and the world heareth them we are of god amen we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us and he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of aaron may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord so he said we'd like to speak to you on this thought on attached attached to the king and if you go to looking at that word of of it it means the expressing of the relationship between a part and a whole and when when you're using that word of it is it is saying that that this whatever you are saying is identifying with this as i would say that that this is a sleeve of my coat or just like i maybe we would say that saturday is one of the days of the week or or it's a it's a it's a series it's a series of sermons or or i can't wait to get a piece of my favorite cake you see you're taking a part of something when you're identifying and putting of in that place and you're placing and saying that that there is a relationship between this one thing and the other and notice what what the word of god says in first john 4 4 that that ye are of god now if you if that's all you catch here this evening you went away you could go away very happy that that you are being expression of a part of the whole that you are of god is that right that ye are of god hallelujah you see we're a part of god and if we are a part of god then no more we can no more perish than what god can perish and the prophet would say that in he that is in you he said you are of god little children and have overcame them talking of the antichrist because greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world has two pronouns see he personal pronoun and he that is in the world and he that's in you and he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world now to me that gives me great consolation this evening that he that's on the inside of me is greater than anything out there in the world anything any new germ that they come up with this god is greater than what they've got out there anything that satan wants to develop in his in his laboratories i am saying to you and the bible is saying to you that stronger is he that is in you than he that is in the world and he would say in in thinking man's filter he said that when you're born of the spirit of god you you are a son of god you always was a son of god and you always will be a son of god and there's no way to separate it because you have eternal life and eternal never did begin i don't think that even people in the in the denominational realm even grasp the power of eternal that if you would begin to think about that this being is temporal but there's something that is laying there that is eternal that will never pass away that will never perish that that even though you get sick and body that soul is still saved and sealed until the day of redemption you see you can go through the pressure cooker of life but there has been a preserve that has been put on top of you it don't matter you can put uh you can put a black jar in the pressure cooker you can put a green jar in a pressure cooker you can put a blue jar and a pressure cooker you can put a clear jar in a pressure cooker but if the seal's been put on there it will be preserved are you with me for years on top of years and you may be all kinds of different races you may have come in all kinds of different colors but i want to say to you that if you have been put in the pressure cooker of life and there's been a seal put on you you can go through covet in flying covers you can go through laodicea with flying colors because there has been a preserver that has put a seal on top of you that you will not be troubled by the sickness and by laodicea and all of the things of life and satan can't keep the revelation down when god wants to give it hallelujah now if you notice and just just turn back your clock just for a few minutes and you look back into the 1960s and you will see that there were three kings that were on the scene in 1960s and you watch as the movement of those three kings how that there was an attachment that was made to those three kings there you watched the movement of martin luther king and you watch as as men would would strive and they would they would press their way to be a part of that movement they would attach themselves and even a prophet would say he said they're not down there in slavery if they were in slavery he said i'd be down there with them but you watch as people would identify themselves with that movement and be identified with the king and even today you still see the work of that king are you with me it's still leading millions to their death identifying themselves with a movement that they are attaching themselves to a to a kingship in this world but also there was another king on the scene there was the king of rock and roll elvis and there's a lot of people that still call him their king are you with me i have to say that he probably wasn't nothing but a hound dog but you watched that there was an attachment to people that attached himself to a movement of a king you watch how that he come out of that pentecostal realm and then he began to he began to take that ability and that potential that he had that he got in his grandfather's tent revival he would take that and manipulate the power of worship and manipulate it in such a way that people would become attached in the spirit realm to a song that would send their souls to a devil hell you see they they're they well i'm just listening to it i just love that kind of music you see when you do that you are attaching yourself to a king the king of rock and roll but also in the 1960s there was more than earthly kings that were on the scene there was another king there was king jesus that was on the scene and there was a people that were attaching themselves to a kingship they were identifying themselves that this voice that they were hearing is the voice from another realm they were attaching themself to a king's word are you with me they were attaching themselves to a pull of the word that was drawing them not to a man but to a ministry of the son of man i say that you're that kind of people that you are the people of an open book that have attached yourself to a kingdom to a kingdom that will never cease to a kingdom that will never fall are you with me there we know that the governments of the world and the kingdoms of the world they will fall they were offered to jesus but jesus turned them down because he knew that he was going to come heir to them in the millennium but he told us right there that the governments of the world wherein the kingdoms of the world were of the devil and the devil had complete control over them but this world is not my home i'm just a passing through the kingdom and the citizenship that i am under is a kingdom that will never cease he said and hear ye him he said if if we could have an obedience to those three words tonight you'll see a repeat of pentecost in this building it's just small but oh there's enough power in there that the rest of the bible will connect to it oh hear ye him you see if you could if you could identify yourself and come under obedience to those words of hear ye him that if you go to hearing this and you go to eating this and you go to digesting this you go to manifesting this is that right you are what you eat if you don't eat this whole book you will only produce part of the book but i don't believe that we are a people that's just wanting to produce half the book this is a full gospel this is a seven course menu that we have been given from above and we have received a kingdom that cannot be shook and we have heard a voice from another world that has told us this world is not your home what was god doing he was gathering himself a body now i read this to you last week and i'll give it to the brother so they could put it up and i feel it's fitting so that you catch where we're going and he says now it says that he hath chosen us in him jesus let's say it together he hath chosen us in him jesus before the foundation of the world that means that that we're right there with him in the mind and thoughts of god before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that let me inject the thought in here even our natural birth is based upon election the female ovaries produce many many eggs but why is it that at a certain time at a certain time an egg comes down and all another one and then amongst the male sperm for no known reason a certain germ attaches itself to the egg while others so that could have that could have just as easily attached himself or had a better opportunity to do so did not do so and perished there is an intelligence behind all of this otherwise what determines whether the baby is a boy or a girl blonde brunette light or dark type of eyes and etc you can read all the books you want to about how you that you can eat this type of vegetable or this type of cookie and if you eat this type of lemon bar or this whatever that it'll produce it'll have the ability to produce the genetics that you're wanting you're wanting the redhead sure we all wanted a red here coming out of the spencer family i don't know why i know how redheads are but we all wanted a redhead but we didn't get a red hit so there's got to be an intelligence that's over toppled all of this are you with me i'd say that there's some of you that would say you know what if i could i would look like brother william back there honestly if i could be about six foot six foot five i'd never have to worry i don't know six foot two i wouldn't ever have to worry about getting my skin all burned up like a lobster wouldn't have to wear long sleeve shirts everywhere sure we'd like to pick out a different stature i'd like to be the size of josh jones back there when i come through the doors the devil knows i'm in a place but you see there is an intelligence that tells every person what they're going to be like he knows how tall you are how skinny you are how fat you are how short you are he's in control oh wouldn't you like to have the button to push yes six foot two dark hair perfect teeth breath never smells bad they made a tool for that it's called a toothbrush you might want to try it out ask your wife but you think about that every person sitting in this place tonight is completely made up differently if you go to looking at your fingerprints there's not one of you in here that has the same identical fingerprint as the person beside you you see there's a code that is laying on the inside of your human genos that tells you where you came from and if you go to studying out dna and you go to looking at the the power of dna to me when i go to reading those things i'm just thanking the lord that he's in control of all this and but when you go to looking at how powerful the human body is how so precise that it is when you go and look at an eyeball and you look at all the different nerves of everything that runs through there there's got to be somebody that's in control surely we didn't just evolve into these creatures of matter that we are but if you look at that gene if you would take a gene which you can't even see with your own eyes there's millions of them if you let them put them underneath a microscope but if you would take that one dna sale and you would stretch that one dna cell it would be over six foot long one little cell but if you would take the whole dna from a human body it's over a hundred billion miles of dna that's in one body you have enough dna inside of your body to span our solar system 14 times but i got the choice today whether i want to be a male or a female you see the kind of leodyster age that we are in when people want to manipulate the cells of life and they want to turn and change what they were there is an intelligence that told you that you was going to be a boy and there was an intelligence that told you that you was going to be a girl and if you've got some kind of intelligence that's telling you that you have the right to change that you need to change your own intelligence god made you into the creature that you are hallelujah hallelujah i'm more than here just to give you a science lesson on dna tonight i'm trying to tell you where you came from if i can tell you where you came from and you can realize where you're going there won't be one thing down here that'll control your mind more than just getting up there one dna cell one of them has enough storing power to hold and is the equivalent to 358 000 hours of hd video one cell you see you are carrying things in your in your dna code that are telling you that this was your grandfather that this was your grandmother and search it all the way back and you'll watch as those those dna cells that were brought down through the issues of life and they're passed right on through you and going to your children and it just keeps going and going and going but you see there's so much dna that's laying on the inside of you 358 000 hours if you watched it if you watched it it would take you i believe over 90 years watching it every hour of your life to watch one dna cell but i want you to think about this where did you come from where are you attached from you see you can i save you some money they got this thing out there and call it i'll just give it to you in in simple virginia language you can spit in this tube and you can put it in the mail and they'll send it off to somewhere in kalamazoo and they'll send it back to you and they'll tell you where you came from let me tell you something saints let me save you 59 or 100 dollars i know where you came from if you are born again son and daughter of god you came from god and you're going back to god and there's so much dna of the blood of jesus christ on the inside of you if there's 358 000 hours let satan study that dna look it over satan take a look at this dna take a look at what the blood did it didn't just cover my flesh it covered every cell in my body oh there is a blood hallelujah so if there to be a son of god you had to be in him always that gene of your life that spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there was ever even a molecule and you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as a son of god now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age walk out the door you can go out here saying that i was before the foundation of the world and i was manifested in this hour that gene was released in this hour to light up this age there might be some people that want to put it out there might be some people that want to kill us but we were manifested to light up the age that was the darkest of all ages when nobody wants the word no more with no money when nobody wants the baptism of the holy ghost anymore there is a gene seed of god that was electing you and choosing you before there was an ever molecule ever spoken into existence hallelujah you can't impersonate this seed you can't dress it up science may be able to hybridize and they might be able to manipulate the the the gene of a flower and the gene the gene of a tree and a and of a plant and manipulate it and hybridize out but only the original will bring forth life you can plant that hybrid and it will not come up again the next year but you take that original life and you put it down in the ground it's got to come up that's why i know that if there is a gene seed of god that's sitting on the inside of you when the word of the sun begins to come across your life it'll bring it up he's the one that planted it surely he can get it up i'm not going to give up what i was i'm not going to give up my drinking i'm not going to give up my good old times try all you want to are you with me if you're his god is good at getting his children he knows where you're sitting at you can play hide and seek all you want to he's coming for you hallelujah and he ain't ever lost one surely he can't lose him now if he thought of you before the world ever began surely him being an infinite god knows where your hiding place is well there's no hiding place down here there's no hiding place down here oh hallelujah hallelujah might be one of them singing songs singing sermons tonight get y'all happy here hallelujah when we go back and you look at our text of genesis chapter 4 and you watch how that it was the seed that made the difference and you notice what eve said notice it was eve that said this that i have gotten a son from the lord you know brother biscuit he put his whole he put his whole emphasis when he was coming to brother branham with his questions on serpent seed he come to him with genesis chapter 4 and he laid it out before him and he took away every bit of his strategy when he said that's absolutely the truth he said but go on and read verse two he said i had spent so much time studying verse 1 that i didn't know what verse 2 was hallelujah hallelujah and she again bore abel certainly god is the only creator of life only life can come through god it can't come through satan satan can pervert but he cannot create but you see but you see god is the only creator and through the spirit that he let come upon him you couldn't attach what cain did to what got to god you couldn't attach that jealousy spirit that was on cane to god that didn't come from god that came from the pits of hell and let me say it to you now it still comes from the pits of hell i'm jealous of this christian watch what you're attaching yourself to you see where did he get that nature to be jealous from his father from satan his father where did he get that spirit of murder the first murder you couldn't say that come out of god it had to come out of the devil but you watch what abel brought forth you watch the issues of life where did abel come from when you watch what he brought before the lord his sacrifice it had to come from adam you see but cain bore the full spiritual characteristics of satan and the animalistic sensual fleshly characteristics of the serpent notice in first john 3 and 12 he says that not as cain who was of that wicked one apart identified with the whole cain was of that wicked one so you see the power of the seed that the seed was the one that made the difference that you had one of the serpent seed and one of the seed of adam you watched that seed it'll be so close cain longed to worship god cain was as religious as abel but you watch what cain brought cain brought of the fruit of the land showing are you with me showing where he was coming from but abel caught a revelation abel caught a revelation of faith that it was the blood that got them out of eden that'll put them back into eden and surely it'll be blood that'll put you back there abel knew that this was the only way that god would receive his sacrifice the seed always produces exactly what it is you watch as that true and that false fine as they begin to intertwingle themselves i didn't say that right that's country but they begin to intertwine themselves and they begin they get so close that if you don't pay attention you can't watch which one's the true one and which one's the false one but oh there's an angel that knows he knows where you're sitting at tonight he knows where you are in your home he knows who you are this ain't some santa claus that just watches you when you're sleeping he sees when you're pouting he sees when you're awake he knows all of your mistakes this is a god that knows all things you see and when you watch when it come time for the royal seed the second adam not to be born he was not born of man but he was conceived in the womb of mary that mary was the incubator to bring forth the perfect sun you see that blood cell it had to come from his father you see it that blood is passed down the life is passed down from the husband it was not part mary neither was it part god it was all god if it was just part mary and part god we're all lost tonight you see what you got god doing right there having an act with a fleshly woman it won't work it won't get you out of the grave it won't get you it won't make you whole but the blood that i'm talking about tonight that is all god it'll get you out of the grave it'll wash your sin it'll pick you up and make you a new creature in christ jesus oh this blood hallelujah is not part jew nor part gentile it's all god his created blood cell and when that blood cell broke at calvary all my sins are washed they're all washed away hallelujah well you see mary was not that seed she was simply a carrier of that seed just like pentecost pentecost was not that seed pentecost was a carrier of that seed and you watch as it was so close that even jesus would say in matthew 24 that in the last days that it would be so close that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible you watch as that stalk is coming forth but you remember that the that the seed will not be air with that suck as it's coming all the way up through there that life is pressing out some of you are ashamed of where you came from but if you remember it was pentecost that protected you it was pentecost that protected that seed are you with me are you with me you see for you to have life the shock had to pull away it had to pull back it had to give way oh hallelujah they were a part of the process but they are not the seed it's seed time it's bright time it's manifesting time the same seed that went in the ground is the same seed that's come up it's not another seed it's the seed oh the life that i now live hallelujah the life that i now live i was watching i was watching a video you probably some of you that if you listen to music if you watch it on youtube you watch that there's there's a pentecostal group that sings waymaker i believe it's a pentecost of alexandria and you watch them you watch them and you see you see them in their worship and you if you go on you can see some of their some of the preachers and you would think if you'd watch some of that just for a moment you'd catch a glimpse that they were that close i was speaking uh brother the brothers this week and i was telling them you're watching they were right there they had it in their grips the father of pentecost let it slip away what for but you watch how powerful their ministries are sure they'll speak in tongues maybe more speaking more in tongues than what you do they may shout more than you two may they might even have a bigger hairdo than you do sisters they say higher the bun the closer you are to god but you watch them they can dance in the spirit and sure it's a true spirit of god because the rain falls on the just and the unjust but you watch when it comes down when it comes to the word test they'll always fail are you with me they will take pentecostal bait they'll take a sign and they'll take a wonder over what the word says but you let the bride see that she'll say it's nothing but the word for me but i'll take them signs and them wonders too hallelujah hallelujah we're not seeing in part is that right that's what paul would say when i was a child i spake as a child but when i became a man he didn't speak like a child no more he spoke like a man church of the living god you can be a man you can be a real man of god a real daughter of god and be a real man be a real believer remember where you came from you're watching you're watching if they ain't been with that if they ain't been with the male you can watch those little you can watch in springtime you can watch them little robins they begin to build their nest they'll go in there and they'll build their nest maybe you got like that little boy syndrome still inside of you and you'll climb a tree and you look in there and blue then blue eggs that are sitting there and you'll watch them mama rob and she'll come and sit on that nest and sit there and sit there and sit there and sometimes you'll see them little robins pop her head up but sometimes you can climb up in a tree i don't know anybody else done that i'm speaking as somebody else here but you climb up in there when you watch all them other little robins start flying away and you can climb up in there and you can look and then blue eggs still sitting there they sit there and sit there and that mama sits on them faithfully every day but because they had never been with a male are you with me he will never come to life just like a hen if she ain't never been with a rooster those eggs can sit right there they can sit right there and they can never produce anything but just an egg but like brother jules said i like eggs but i like the manifestation of the egg a whole lot better but you can see you can put that egg right up in there let me preach to you just a little bit you can put that egg in there oh ain't little susie just a fine looking egg she's got such a perfect rounded shape got a great nice eggshell of color about her and oh it's such strong got calcium in it and oh it's just so beautiful you can look like an egg you can even wobble like an egg but if you ain't been with a male it ain't coming to life i just preached to you hallelujah if you have not been with the male if you have not been with jesus you will not produce jesus you can sing all you want to you can raise your hands all you want to you can clap for me while i'm singing and settle me while i'm preaching but it'll never come to life unless you've been with the papa god you can get mad at the pastor all you want to because he preaches on you and you can go around pouting and sticking that big fat lip of yours out saying he preached don't poop and you'll watch i was i was told right here on this platform goats enjoy govinda hallelujah but you watch you watch you watch people get so mad hey he called he just about called my name from the whole church i am so embarrassed everybody knows that was me because you put it all over facebook they'll go to pounding and sticking that limp out on me he preached on me but you watch a real gene seat of god and the pastor goes to preach them they say thank you jesus he's getting me rapture ready why they have been with jesus it's something on the inside and it's breaking out on the outside oh hallelujah i'm so happy that the lord brought me out i'm so happy that the lord brought me out if it had not been for jesus oh where would i be i'm so happy that the lord brought me high well i've been singing since the lord brought me out i've been singing since the lord brought me out if it had not been for jesus oh where would i be i'm so happy that the lord brought me out well i'm so glad that the lord

which they will worship him in spirit and in truth and this is that hour anybody can praise him praise is embracing god for what he has done i thank you god for giving me new shoes i thank you god for giving me a good wife i thank you god for giving me good health i thank you god for saving my soul it's embracing what god has already done but worship goes deeper that's why the spirit seeks such

the god of mercy when i feel like i've fallen i can't get up worship goes deeper when you're in a crisis worship goes deeper when when you lost your health when you're in a battle of life worship goes deeper worship is only what the elect can do it goes deeper into a realm it says god i ain't got it but i'm gonna get it worship is showing you is showing to god that i know you're gonna bring me out because i believe what you have said and you'll learn do you love him you want to worship him you want to be a real worshiper or let the worshipers arise oh are you wanting to be a worshiper not just
