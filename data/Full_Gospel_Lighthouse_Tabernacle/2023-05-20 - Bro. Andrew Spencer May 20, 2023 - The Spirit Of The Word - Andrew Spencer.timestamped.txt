[48:54] [Music]
[49:03] you deserve the Glory
[49:08] Hallelujah why don't you give the Lord a
[49:11] hand clap of praise
[49:17] he's worthy of it all
[49:21] amen We've Come To Worship Him in spirit
[49:25] and in truth we thank you brother
[49:28] Matthew and all of you for setting this
[49:30] atmosphere here tonight it's
[49:32] I just have to say it's one of the most
[49:35] wonderful atmospheres I've walked out to
[49:38] to be able to speak and I just I love
[49:40] that when the Lord feels welcome and it
[49:43] begins to roll out of one room right
[49:45] into a next room and that's that's the
[49:47] power of an atmosphere and and we're
[49:50] just very thankful for that and very
[49:52] thankful for a sensitive song leaders
[49:54] that know how to create an atmosphere so
[49:57] I I certainly appreciate that and we
[50:00] just want to welcome you tonight in the
[50:02] into the house of the Lord all of our
[50:04] visitors here tonight would you say God
[50:06] bless you welcome here and and
[50:09] want to be remembering brother William
[50:11] and his family they're away this weekend
[50:13] speaking down in Georgia there for
[50:15] brother Wade Dale speaking of a few
[50:18] Services there for him this weekend so
[50:20] we want to be remembering brother
[50:21] William this weekend and be remembering
[50:23] us next weekend we'll be headed to
[50:25] brother Donnie Reagan's there in Johnson
[50:27] City to speak a youth meeting for him on
[50:31] the weekend there we'll be taking three
[50:33] services so I just I covet your prayers
[50:35] and
[50:36] that the Lord will do we're expecting
[50:38] great things from the Lord and expecting
[50:41] great things here tonight and I was I
[50:44] was completely going a different course
[50:45] and the Lord stopped me in my tracks
[50:47] yesterday and spoke a word to me and so
[50:49] we'll just follow the leadership of the
[50:52] Lord here tonight and amen let's just go
[50:54] to the author of the word and just go
[50:58] before him I know that there are many
[51:01] physical needs that are amongst us and
[51:03] spiritual needs as well and we know our
[51:05] Lord Jesus Christ is in the building to
[51:08] meet in every meet every single one of
[51:10] these needs and we certainly had a
[51:13] wonderful time with brother Wayne last
[51:14] weekend and the Lord did some amazing
[51:17] things and we saw the pillar of fire
[51:20] come sweeping into the building and
[51:22] actually Brother David Kegley was
[51:23] setting all the way back there and
[51:24] identified
[51:26] at the same time that it was solved that
[51:28] it come right out of this corner comes
[51:30] swooping down through here and you could
[51:32] just feel the transition in that service
[51:34] on Sunday morning it was it was physical
[51:36] it was it was very physical the Lord was
[51:39] here and done some very specific and
[51:40] special things and and I believe that
[51:43] same Lord is here tonight I know we got
[51:45] physical needs that need to be met and I
[51:48] just trust the Lord here tonight that
[51:51] he's more than able to do that so let's
[51:53] just go to the author of the word here
[51:56] begin to speak to him Heavenly Father we
[51:58] come before you tonight Lord
[52:00] wholeheartedly Lord we bow our life
[52:02] before you we recognize that we are
[52:05] insufficient upon our own accord Lord
[52:07] Jesus but we recognize that that our
[52:10] sufficiency is in you father and you're
[52:12] our satisfying portion here tonight and
[52:15] we're just asking that the leadership of
[52:18] the Lord would come tonight and you'd
[52:20] lead every hero tonight through your
[52:22] word father and you would allow us to
[52:25] hear
[52:26] through the the filter of the word Lord
[52:29] not a thinking man's filter but through
[52:31] the Holy Spirit filter and that we would
[52:34] catch every word that is that is for us
[52:36] in this season Lord we know that there
[52:39] are seasons in our life that we are
[52:41] going through but Lord I pray father
[52:43] that right now that you would begin to
[52:45] allow us to reap what you have sown for
[52:49] us Lord and we would begin to manifest
[52:52] the things that have been laying here in
[52:55] the message for years that we would be
[52:57] the manifested sons of God and we would
[52:59] call to order the chaos of our life I
[53:02] know Sister Ruth Ann and brother Donnie
[53:04] Nicholson brother brother Ron and our
[53:07] sister Erica Parker there in Tennessee
[53:08] they have physical needs there's other
[53:11] brothers and sisters brother Randy's
[53:12] sitting here and other needs that are
[53:14] very very needful father and I know God
[53:18] that you're able to do exceedingly
[53:20] abundantly above all that we could ever
[53:22] ask or think and father we come before
[53:24] you one more time lord in your house
[53:26] father to worship you in spirit and in
[53:29] truth and we want you to be able to get
[53:31] the glory here tonight out of every
[53:33] person and every every life and we just
[53:36] ask God you would take complete and
[53:38] supreme control have the preeminence in
[53:40] the service let us get out of the way
[53:42] and be a blessing to you in the name of
[53:45] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray these
[53:47] things in the name of the Lord we pray
[53:50] amen if you have your Bibles we'd like
[53:53] to look over into the New Testament
[53:55] there
[53:56] over into first John chapter 4 and verse
[54:00] 1 and also John chapter 6.
[54:03] and verse 63 first John chapter 4.
[54:19] first John chapter chapter 4 and verse
[54:23] 1.
[54:25] beloved
[54:26] believe not every Spirit but try the
[54:29] spirits
[54:30] whether they are of God because many
[54:33] false prophets are going out into the
[54:35] world hereby know ye the spirit of God
[54:38] every spirit that confesseth that Jesus
[54:40] Christ has come in the flesh is of God
[54:43] and every spirit that confesseth not
[54:45] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[54:48] is not of God and that is that Spirit of
[54:51] antichrist whereof ye have heard that it
[54:54] should come and even now already it is
[54:57] in the world ye are of God little
[55:00] children and have overcame them because
[55:02] greater is he that is in you than he
[55:05] that is in the world they are of the
[55:07] world therefore speak they of the world
[55:10] and the world Hearth them we are of God
[55:13] he that knoweth God heareth us and he
[55:16] that is not of God heareth not us hereby
[55:20] know we the spirit of truth and the
[55:24] spirit of Aaron John chapter 6 and verse
[55:28] 63
[55:30] and our Lord speaking here to us
[55:33] speaks to us and says it is the spirit
[55:36] that quickeneth the flesh profit if
[55:39] nothing the words that I speak unto you
[55:41] they are spirit and they are life may
[55:45] God bless his word he may be seated in
[55:48] the presence of the Lord I would like to
[55:50] speak to you tonight on a thought that
[55:52] the Lord dropped in our heart yesterday
[55:54] about midday on the spirit the spirit of
[55:58] the word the spirit of the word and I
[56:01] find that that as we as we take of a
[56:05] book of any of any nature that we want
[56:07] to find the spirit of that book whether
[56:10] it be whether it be a novel whether it
[56:12] be fiction or non-fiction whatever it
[56:14] may be you want to find the spirit of
[56:16] that book and you want to find or get in
[56:19] the mindset of the author that is
[56:21] writing that book maybe maybe you're
[56:24] taking a non-fiction book or fiction
[56:25] whatever it may be and you're not going
[56:28] to fully be able to grasp it until you
[56:30] get into the spirit or of the mindset of
[56:32] where the author is take taking you and
[56:34] you can never get in to the mindset of
[56:37] Christ without finding the very Spirit
[56:40] of the letter that is laid out here and
[56:42] we we recognize that there is a spirit
[56:45] that backs up the word that we are
[56:48] reading and we recognize that that we're
[56:50] not just reading a dead letter here
[56:52] tonight but we are reading a letter that
[56:54] has a life behind it and you see this
[56:57] isn't this is not just the words of
[56:59] mortal man that we have been reading
[57:01] throughout our Generations but there
[57:03] this word is our Lord Jesus Christ in
[57:07] letter form and we recognize that that
[57:09] there are a lot of books that are sold
[57:11] and there are a lot of books that are on
[57:13] shelves but there is nothing there is no
[57:15] author that has given his life and be
[57:18] able to go to the grave and come back
[57:20] again except our Lord Jesus Christ and
[57:23] we recognize that when we look into the
[57:25] word here that there is a power that is
[57:28] behind the word of God it doesn't matter
[57:29] if you're reading in Isaiah 53 there is
[57:32] a life that is behind that word it
[57:34] doesn't matter if you're reading over in
[57:37] the book of Jude you're finding that
[57:38] that is the same life that was there all
[57:41] the way back in the Old Testament it's
[57:43] the same exact life that was operating
[57:46] back there all the way in the Garden of
[57:48] Eden and we find that that is the very
[57:51] Spirit of the word now William Branham
[57:53] would say he said now he said if you
[57:55] look at every one of us here he said
[57:57] each of us have a right hand or a left
[57:59] hand and he said if you look at them he
[58:01] said they look alike he said they each
[58:03] have fingerprints they each have their
[58:05] characteristics he said that's exactly
[58:07] like you would look over in the Book of
[58:09] Matthew chapter 24 and you would see
[58:11] that in that last day that there would
[58:14] be an antichrist spirit and a true
[58:16] spirit that would come and they would be
[58:18] so close that you would be it would be
[58:21] hard but the if it wasn't for the spirit
[58:23] of the Lord it would deceive the elect
[58:26] if it was possible but that's the way it
[58:29] is in the last days it's the way it is
[58:32] that Spirits are here in the last day
[58:33] days they are somewhat alike you see you
[58:37] see the difference between your right
[58:38] hand and your left hand is that one of
[58:41] them's right and one of them's your left
[58:43] but you see what the difference they've
[58:45] all got different characteristics they
[58:46] all got fingerprints but the difference
[58:48] is one of them's right and one of them's
[58:51] left but we recognize that there are
[58:53] somewhat alike but there they have a
[58:56] characteristic that identifies them one
[58:58] is the right and one of them is wrong
[59:00] just like the spirits in this state
[59:01] there is a Holy Spirit and there is an
[59:04] antichrist Spirit one of them is right
[59:06] and one of them's wrong and it can be
[59:08] identified by its characteristics and
[59:11] the spirit of God can be identified by
[59:13] its characteristics the spirit of the
[59:16] church can be identified by its
[59:18] characteristic there is a church Spirit
[59:20] a spirit of God that absolutely not like
[59:22] the church Spirit at all there is a
[59:24] denominational Spirit there's a national
[59:26] Spirit he said there's a spirit of the
[59:28] nation Every Nation when I go into it
[59:30] you walk in there and you find a
[59:33] different spirit I went into Finland and
[59:35] they're fine people but there was a
[59:37] finished spirit and I go down into
[59:38] Germany and there's a German Spirit you
[59:41] see you can identify individuals by the
[59:45] characteristics and you'll see and
[59:46] identify by the spirit that they have
[59:49] and you can identify the enemy that you
[59:52] are facing or the the obstacle that you
[59:54] are up against whether it's of God or
[59:57] whether it's of the Enemy by the spirit
[59:59] of the word if it is bringing you closer
[1:00:02] to God you can identify that it is the
[1:00:04] holy spirit can you identify that it is
[1:00:07] the holy spirit that has led you here to
[1:00:10] this church building tonight to bring
[1:00:12] you closer to the Lord but you can
[1:00:14] identify that if it was an evil spirit
[1:00:16] that would take you out into the world
[1:00:18] that would make you do wrong things but
[1:00:20] we recognize that the Bible is very
[1:00:22] clear to us that the prophecy came not
[1:00:25] an old by the will of man but it was by
[1:00:27] holy men of God as they spake they were
[1:00:30] moved by the Holy Ghost and we recognize
[1:00:33] that all scripture is given by the
[1:00:36] inspiration of God so we recognize that
[1:00:39] if you would take a book of a of a
[1:00:41] dictionary or or if you take a book of
[1:00:43] men of of great Scholars you would look
[1:00:45] at it and put it all together and you
[1:00:47] would take all of their ideas of their
[1:00:49] theologies and you would combine it
[1:00:51] together they would have all kinds of
[1:00:52] different ideas but you can take the
[1:00:54] Bible tonight and you can search it from
[1:00:57] Genesis all the way to Revelations and
[1:00:59] you'll find that it is the same exact
[1:01:01] tune all the way through from Genesis to
[1:01:04] Revelations that Jesus Christ is our
[1:01:08] Lord
[1:01:09] he is our Lord you can go all the way
[1:01:12] there's not another book that is written
[1:01:14] there's not another book that's on the
[1:01:15] in the pages or in the Library of
[1:01:18] Congress that has this one Spirit now
[1:01:21] brother random he said now he said now
[1:01:23] he would say now I'm not a preacher and
[1:01:25] I just want to lay a few things here he
[1:01:26] said anybody knows that I'm not a
[1:01:28] preacher he said but I'm made up in a
[1:01:30] spiritual form of watching things and
[1:01:32] seeing things move or forewarning people
[1:01:34] of things that's coming to pass he said
[1:01:37] it's just my makeup I can't help that no
[1:01:39] more than you can help that your makeup
[1:01:41] but God has put us each one in the body
[1:01:43] to do certain things he said and I watch
[1:01:45] a little every move of every objective
[1:01:47] every motive because everything is
[1:01:49] governed by a spirit he said this church
[1:01:52] was put here for a purpose speaking in
[1:01:55] in Shreveport Louisiana at life at Life
[1:01:57] Tabernacle there at his friend Jack
[1:02:00] Moore's church and you I think this is
[1:02:02] pretty profound that he said this church
[1:02:04] was put here for a purpose he said there
[1:02:07] is a spirit behind this church certainly
[1:02:09] Spirit behind your home behind every
[1:02:11] building behind everything there is a
[1:02:14] spirit a motive and an objective he said
[1:02:16] this church comes here he said to
[1:02:18] greatly exalt some human system or
[1:02:20] something then its motive is not right
[1:02:23] but if it's put here to try to achieve
[1:02:25] something for the kingdom of God then
[1:02:27] the motive and the objective both is
[1:02:30] right if the motive is directed the same
[1:02:32] way if it's all directed the same way
[1:02:34] you can find that it's going to achieve
[1:02:37] something for the kingdom of God but
[1:02:39] you'll find that that later on that they
[1:02:41] didn't want anything to do with this
[1:02:43] Malachi 4 Ministry if you go down there
[1:02:46] to Life Tabernacle where it used to be
[1:02:48] at that there they have now set up there
[1:02:50] it's just become a it's just become a
[1:02:52] holding place and right across the
[1:02:54] street there's a statue of of Elvis that
[1:02:58] he was born right there in those streets
[1:02:59] but you recognize where Life Tabernacle
[1:03:02] went if you go and look at the where the
[1:03:04] pastor is today they're far away from
[1:03:06] being called Life Tabernacle but notice
[1:03:09] what brother made him say he said now he
[1:03:10] said I try to stay in the word he said
[1:03:13] that you get the spirit of the word
[1:03:16] I try to stay in the word that you get
[1:03:18] the spirit of the word not based upon
[1:03:21] some man's theology but thus saith the
[1:03:24] Lord again he said if there's one thing
[1:03:25] that I've tried to stay clean of I've
[1:03:28] never tried any Sensations or anything
[1:03:30] to get people to look at me I've tried
[1:03:33] not to even lay my hands upon a person
[1:03:34] but to preach the gospel and let God do
[1:03:37] it and he said if there's one thing when
[1:03:39] I stand the Judgment bar he said I don't
[1:03:41] want to have anything I don't want to
[1:03:43] have to give an account for a bunch of
[1:03:45] illegitimate born children he said I'm
[1:03:47] going to preach the word to them preach
[1:03:50] to them the word the word of God and
[1:03:52] they have the spirit of the word or they
[1:03:55] don't have it at all you see it's God's
[1:03:57] spirit that comes by the seed of God is
[1:03:59] the word of God that's planted in your
[1:04:01] heart that brings Christ Jesus not some
[1:04:04] emotion and not some fantastic so if you
[1:04:07] preach the word and you're sitting here
[1:04:09] and you're baptized filled with the Holy
[1:04:11] Ghost you have the very Spirit of the
[1:04:15] word so you can set here and you can
[1:04:17] understand what I'm saying to you
[1:04:19] because you are under the same
[1:04:21] inspiration that the word of the Lord
[1:04:23] was written and you would quickly
[1:04:25] recognize if there would be something
[1:04:28] that would be preached that would be off
[1:04:30] key you would quickly identify that as
[1:04:32] something that is wrong or missed
[1:04:34] because it's not in the spirit of the
[1:04:37] word you see if Eve would have been if
[1:04:39] she would have really stepped into her
[1:04:41] position she would have recognized that
[1:04:43] that was Satan talking to her and not
[1:04:45] almighty God she would have recognized
[1:04:47] because the spirit behind it was
[1:04:49] completely off with what the word had
[1:04:52] already spoken but notice what Paul
[1:04:54] tells us in Ephesians 1 and 13 in whom
[1:04:57] you also trusted after that you heard
[1:05:00] the word of Truth The Gospel of your
[1:05:02] salvation in whom also after that you
[1:05:04] believe you were sealed with that Holy
[1:05:06] Spirit of Promise which is the earnest
[1:05:09] of our inheritance until the Redemption
[1:05:11] of the purchased possession until the
[1:05:13] praise of his glory Paul was say in
[1:05:16] Galatians 5 and 25 he said if we live in
[1:05:19] the spirit he said let us also walk in
[1:05:22] the spirit so if we are living in the
[1:05:24] spirit then our actions have got to
[1:05:26] prove that they are backed up by the
[1:05:29] very word of God is that right you see
[1:05:31] it's just like a gift that is operating
[1:05:33] in a church if it's not operating
[1:05:35] according to the Bible then something is
[1:05:37] off it's not living according to the
[1:05:40] Bible but if it is a true gift that's
[1:05:42] been placed into a church it can operate
[1:05:44] in the channel of inspiration that God
[1:05:47] has deposited in the church to edify the
[1:05:50] Church of the Living God and you'll
[1:05:51] watch whether it's a gift of Prophecy or
[1:05:53] a gift of wisdom or or a gift of
[1:05:55] knowledge or a gift of faith it lines
[1:05:58] itself up with the word of God and
[1:06:00] immediately all of those gifts of the
[1:06:02] body begin to operate together to bring
[1:06:05] the spirit of the body closer to the
[1:06:07] headship
[1:06:09] now notice he said he said he it wasn't
[1:06:12] so from the beginning he said that's the
[1:06:14] same thing that we've got today he said
[1:06:16] hear the Holy Spirit he's here in the
[1:06:19] person of the Holy Ghost he's hunting
[1:06:21] out and searching out a bride of Jesus
[1:06:24] Christ you see so right here right now
[1:06:26] throughout all the Land There is a great
[1:06:28] holy spirit that is searching out abroad
[1:06:31] for our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:34] you see but many times people will choke
[1:06:37] down the experience of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:38] with their ideas or their Creeds or
[1:06:41] things of their life but the holy spirit
[1:06:43] is searching some for somebody that will
[1:06:46] be a vessel full of the Holy Ghost just
[1:06:49] like Elise or when they come hunting out
[1:06:51] abroad for Isaac he come in there under
[1:06:54] the inspiration of Abraham Abraham had
[1:06:57] told him to go down there to his Kindred
[1:06:59] and go down there and pick out a bride
[1:07:01] for his son Isaac but notice when Lu sir
[1:07:04] made an Elias are called that Rebecca
[1:07:07] match the spirit of
[1:07:11] Eliza's prayer that he had prayed so
[1:07:13] Rebecca moved right into the spirit of
[1:07:16] his prayer and Rebecca may not have
[1:07:19] understood why she was operating the way
[1:07:21] that she was operating but she was under
[1:07:23] the anointing of Eliza's prayer and
[1:07:26] there may be some things that you don't
[1:07:28] understand why you're going the way that
[1:07:30] you're going but you're simply operating
[1:07:32] under the Malachi 4 operation of the
[1:07:35] anointing of the Holy Ghost you may not
[1:07:37] fully understand why you're watering the
[1:07:40] camels
[1:07:41] fully understand why you're praising God
[1:07:43] like you are but you're simply under the
[1:07:46] inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:48] and what is it that you're doing you are
[1:07:51] matching the prophecy that has been
[1:07:53] given for you toward this day
[1:07:56] you see what was Rebecca doing she was
[1:07:58] discovering she was discovering that
[1:08:00] there was something that was already
[1:08:02] talked about that she was moving into
[1:08:04] and when you begin to work into faith
[1:08:07] and you begin to let your faith loose
[1:08:09] and all of a sudden you feel the
[1:08:11] atmosphere begin to change what are you
[1:08:13] doing you are operating and you're
[1:08:15] discovering that the word of God has
[1:08:18] already said that you're already healed
[1:08:20] so Rebecca was operating in a place that
[1:08:24] something had already been prepared for
[1:08:26] her little church let me say to you you
[1:08:29] are operating in a place that the Holy
[1:08:31] Spirit has already pre-planned
[1:08:34] and you might think well this is just
[1:08:36] another day or I'm just having another
[1:08:37] bad day or I'm just going through the
[1:08:40] motions again no there is nothing that
[1:08:42] is happening to you that our father
[1:08:44] hasn't already seen that he hasn't
[1:08:46] already worked out for you that he's
[1:08:48] working all things for the good to them
[1:08:50] that love God you see you see you are
[1:08:53] going to discover in this word that he's
[1:08:56] got something laying there that is
[1:08:58] simply for you and for nobody else
[1:09:02] foreign
[1:09:03] is that right it's just like when men
[1:09:05] came here to this earth there we we've
[1:09:07] come so far I think this past 100 years
[1:09:10] would be the grandest of times to be
[1:09:12] living if you could sit down and talk to
[1:09:14] some of our elders talk about all the
[1:09:16] changes that we've went through all the
[1:09:18] discoveries that we've went through I'd
[1:09:20] say that if we could speak to our
[1:09:21] grandparents that they would have never
[1:09:23] thought that they had been talking to a
[1:09:25] buzzing box without a wire on it 30
[1:09:27] years ago or 40 years ago but some man
[1:09:31] tapped into a channel that you you and I
[1:09:33] couldn't see it was there when I was
[1:09:35] born those things weren't there but yet
[1:09:38] somebody believed that it could be found
[1:09:40] and they tapped into a channel somebody
[1:09:43] with an apple tapped into it and looked
[1:09:46] into it and said you know what I believe
[1:09:48] that we can have a buzzing box that's
[1:09:51] got all kinds of applications on it that
[1:09:53] men will be able to search up whatever
[1:09:55] they want
[1:09:56] it's been sitting here all the way since
[1:09:59] Adam was here but men in this past 100
[1:10:02] years have now tapped into that channel
[1:10:05] where it could be released to you and I
[1:10:10] now I know that the World Wide Web was
[1:10:12] created for was created for worldly
[1:10:14] purposes but it was also created to get
[1:10:16] this gospel out
[1:10:18] there is nothing that has been created
[1:10:20] by Humanity that has not been by
[1:10:23] Almighty God's inspiration
[1:10:26] come on somebody you can sit on your
[1:10:29] iPhone or you can sit there and have a
[1:10:31] sermon on your iPhone
[1:10:34] it's see it depends on what inspiration
[1:10:36] that you're under you see it's like
[1:10:39] you're riding down the car riding down
[1:10:40] the road in a piece of metal well most
[1:10:43] of it's made out of aluminum or plastic
[1:10:45] nowadays but there was somebody that had
[1:10:47] the idea to get that metal out of the
[1:10:50] ground that you're setting on and said
[1:10:52] you know what I believe I can put this
[1:10:54] piece of metal put it together and
[1:10:56] somebody will be able to roll down the
[1:10:58] wheels roll down the road at a maximum
[1:11:00] speed of 30 miles an hour well they
[1:11:02] broke past that
[1:11:04] but you see somebody had the thought it
[1:11:07] was laying there all those years
[1:11:12] come on somebody it was laying there
[1:11:14] when Luther was here
[1:11:16] was laying there when all we had was
[1:11:18] horse and Buggies but it took somebody
[1:11:20] to discover that we can have the
[1:11:23] abilities to do these things
[1:11:26] all of these things were laying here in
[1:11:28] the word of God but it took a profit
[1:11:30] under a prophetic anointing to come here
[1:11:33] and discover that these things are for
[1:11:36] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:11:39] is that right
[1:11:40] it's like this beautiful electricity
[1:11:42] that you have in here Ben Franklin one
[1:11:45] night watched set out there saw a storm
[1:11:47] that was coming saw the lightning and
[1:11:49] thought you know what I need to be able
[1:11:51] to harness that if man can harness that
[1:11:54] kind of ability he can use it to put it
[1:11:57] in his house
[1:11:58] but he never could get to it and all he
[1:12:01] did when the lightning struck thy teeth
[1:12:03] he said I got it but he didn't know what
[1:12:06] he had
[1:12:08] I'd say that's the way a lot of people
[1:12:10] when they first come into the message
[1:12:12] they said I got it but they really
[1:12:14] didn't know what they had
[1:12:17] come on somebody you didn't recognize
[1:12:19] exactly the Fulfillment of what you were
[1:12:22] holding in your hand but it is the
[1:12:24] Fulfillment for a body change
[1:12:28] come on somebody Spurgeon knew that the
[1:12:30] ability to open up the seals was coming
[1:12:33] but it wasn't for him to do it but it
[1:12:36] took a Thomas Edison to take Benjamin
[1:12:38] Franklin's idea tap into it and break
[1:12:41] into a world to discover that we can
[1:12:43] have a light bulb that we can take that
[1:12:46] same power that's up there in the sky by
[1:12:49] lightning and put it in every house
[1:12:52] now call me crazy but I believe that the
[1:12:55] same power that came down in the upper
[1:12:57] room can be in every one of these houses
[1:13:00] and you may have not have discovered
[1:13:02] yourself as of yet but there's a holy
[1:13:05] ghost that is hunting out a bride that's
[1:13:08] searching for one young girl that's
[1:13:10] looking for a young man that's so
[1:13:12] emptied out
[1:13:15] Paul had to discover himself
[1:13:20] known as Saul for a long time
[1:13:23] known as a murderer for a long time but
[1:13:25] when the pillar fire met him he had been
[1:13:27] discovered you see the man that was
[1:13:30] going to write 14 books of your Bible I
[1:13:32] was going a different way but when the
[1:13:34] Holy Ghost discovered Paul what did he
[1:13:37] create he created somebody that would be
[1:13:40] the first Apostle the first prophet the
[1:13:43] first church age messenger what did
[1:13:45] Brian what did Christ what did he expose
[1:13:48] when he found Paul
[1:13:50] he found somebody that could set the
[1:13:52] church in order under the pattern of the
[1:13:55] Holy Ghost
[1:13:56] you see what did Edison want to do what
[1:13:58] was his motive his motive was not just
[1:14:01] to keep it for himself his motive was to
[1:14:04] bring it to all this generation
[1:14:08] Hallelujah and if you want to be healed
[1:14:11] if you want to be healed you got to have
[1:14:13] the right motive if you want to be
[1:14:15] filled with the Holy Ghost you're going
[1:14:16] to have the right motive if you're
[1:14:18] simply wanting to be healed so that you
[1:14:20] can go out and live your own kind of
[1:14:22] Life have have your own good time go out
[1:14:25] and create and get yourself more money
[1:14:27] God is not going to hear your prayer
[1:14:30] but if your motive is Lord I need to be
[1:14:33] healed so that I can serve you to a
[1:14:36] greater ability Lord I need to be healed
[1:14:39] so that I can raise my daughters or
[1:14:41] raise my children raise my family so
[1:14:44] that I could be so that I could be an
[1:14:46] example
[1:14:48] you're going to discover that God Is A
[1:14:51] Healer
[1:14:54] come here in the right motive tonight
[1:14:56] you're going to find that the spirit of
[1:14:58] the word is looking out for somebody
[1:15:05] can we get a little bit fantastic here
[1:15:07] just for a moment but I believe that the
[1:15:09] spirit of the Lord is here to search out
[1:15:12] somebody to fill them with the Holy
[1:15:14] Ghost
[1:15:15] I believe that the spirit of the Lord is
[1:15:18] here to heal sister Ruth Ann or brother
[1:15:21] Donnie Nicholson or brother Ron or all
[1:15:23] these other brothers and sisters I know
[1:15:25] it seems a little bit fanatical to
[1:15:27] believe that that the impossible could
[1:15:29] come in these four corners and create a
[1:15:32] supernatural event but I want you to
[1:15:34] know that there's going to be somebody
[1:15:36] that discovers that the god of the Bible
[1:15:39] is still the god of today
[1:15:44] you see what's your motive in behind it
[1:15:46] of asking now when you're asking for
[1:15:48] brother odds healing why are you asking
[1:15:50] for it because you need a pastor
[1:15:52] because we need an example that God
[1:15:56] still heals for stage cancer
[1:16:00] still need a daddy
[1:16:02] I still need a friend why are we asking
[1:16:05] for sister Ruth and shiftlets healing
[1:16:07] it's because it belongs to the Church of
[1:16:10] the Living God
[1:16:12] [Applause]
[1:16:14] come on somebody why you asking for
[1:16:16] brother Donny's healing because it
[1:16:18] belongs to the Church of the Living God
[1:16:20] we need our bass players
[1:16:22] why are you asking that these young
[1:16:24] girls get the Holy Ghost because we need
[1:16:26] them in the economy of God
[1:16:28] what's your motive in asking
[1:16:32] we're not asking for our own selfish
[1:16:34] vain but if you're sick here tonight
[1:16:36] you're going to find that he's the Lord
[1:16:37] Our God that heals all of our diseases
[1:16:40] if you're sick you're going to be able
[1:16:42] to discover that Isaiah 53 and 5 that he
[1:16:45] was wounded for your transgressions he
[1:16:47] was bruised for your iniquities the
[1:16:49] chastisement of your peace was upon him
[1:16:51] and by his stripes you are healed
[1:16:55] what did Jesus Christ do he came under
[1:16:58] the inspiration of Isaiah and he
[1:17:01] discovered that his Brokenness was your
[1:17:03] perfection
[1:17:06] what did Jesus do he come under the
[1:17:09] burden of the word I said I am healing
[1:17:12] for all the nations
[1:17:16] what was it he discovered that he was
[1:17:19] layer laying there
[1:17:22] I'd say there were times when Jesus
[1:17:25] didn't feel like being Jesus
[1:17:29] when he's laying back there in the back
[1:17:30] of the boat he didn't feel like being
[1:17:33] Jesus he was worn out he'd been
[1:17:35] preaching but what was he wanting his
[1:17:38] disciples to do was discover that the
[1:17:41] power that he had they had it too
[1:17:45] come on somebody how are you going to
[1:17:48] get out of the chaos of your life if you
[1:17:50] don't recognize that there is a
[1:17:53] discovery that's got to be made this
[1:17:55] ain't just for Hattie Wright
[1:17:57] this ain't just for a little fishy this
[1:17:59] ain't just for a storm this is for the
[1:18:02] Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:04] we are standing upon top of the greatest
[1:18:06] discovery that's ever been found
[1:18:10] I was talking to a guy probably a month
[1:18:12] and a half ago and he was talking to me
[1:18:14] about radar and all these things on a
[1:18:16] fishing boat he said he knows they've
[1:18:18] got this if they've got the ability to
[1:18:20] be able to look into the water he said
[1:18:22] surely you would think they'd be able to
[1:18:23] find the Titanic I saw thought man what
[1:18:26] kind of rock are you living under
[1:18:27] they've already found that joker
[1:18:32] he's still looking for him to find it
[1:18:34] and it's already been found
[1:18:36] some of you still thinking that you're
[1:18:38] lost but you're already found
[1:18:41] some of you still going through the same
[1:18:43] problems that you went through 20 years
[1:18:45] ago but God's already paid for that
[1:18:50] you've already been found you've already
[1:18:52] been sealed you've already been changed
[1:18:57] come on somebody you're looking at the
[1:19:00] greatest discovery that the world has

[1:19:07] me
[1:19:09] it's Timmy Batten
[1:19:12] it's Chris Marsh you're looking at the

[1:19:28] I'll tell them where it's at
[1:19:35] come on somebody they keep looking
[1:19:37] thinking it's coming from a monkey
[1:19:40] I could tell them where it came from
[1:19:43] what was it it was a hillbilly
[1:19:45] Kentuckian that broke down the word of
[1:19:47] God what they was looking for all their
[1:19:49] money that they spent
[1:19:51] William Bradham tapped into a channel
[1:19:53] and said it was twins back there in the
[1:19:56] Garden of Eden what was it it was
[1:19:58] somebody that was fellowshipping with
[1:20:00] the one that created the Garden of Eden
[1:20:05] come on now now what you worried about
[1:20:08] what you worried about what's your
[1:20:10] healing what's your process that you're

[1:20:38] big your problem is and start telling

[1:20:43] there ever has been he never lost a case
[1:20:45] he never went down in defeat he went
[1:20:48] down into the grave and he rose up on
[1:20:50] Easter morning
[1:20:51] cancer ain't big enough for my God
[1:20:54] diseases ain't big enough for our God
[1:20:58] come on somebody they're looking for a
[1:21:01] cure for cancer but I've already found
[1:21:03] it
[1:21:04] the spirit of the word brother Chris has
[1:21:06] had it's here
[1:21:09] if the serpent seat is here then the
[1:21:12] elect of God is here
[1:21:17] hallelujah what did he do he come under
[1:21:19] the inspiration of the author of the
[1:21:21] word
[1:21:22] notice what Jeremiah said
[1:21:24] 17-13 he said oh Lord the hope of Israel
[1:21:27] all that forsake me shall be ashamed and
[1:21:30] all that depart from me shall be written
[1:21:32] in the Earth because they have forsaken
[1:21:34] the Lord the Fountain of the Living
[1:21:36] Waters
[1:21:37] Heal Me O Lord
[1:21:39] and I shall be healed
[1:21:41] save me and I shall be saved for thou
[1:21:44] art my praise behold they say unto me
[1:21:47] where is the word of the Lord let it
[1:21:50] come now where is it where is the god of
[1:21:53] Jacob where is the god of Abraham
[1:21:57] let the god that wrote to her let him
[1:21:59] come and vindicate the word
[1:22:02] what did William Branham do stand there
[1:22:04] night after night
[1:22:06] said if I've spoke the Lord let him come
[1:22:08] and confirm it and vindicate that it's
[1:22:10] true what was he under he was under the
[1:22:13] inspiration of the angel
[1:22:15] he was under that inspiration a lot of
[1:22:18] people don't understand it
[1:22:20] a lot of people didn't understand why
[1:22:21] Jeremiah was going through what he was
[1:22:23] going through known as the weeping
[1:22:25] prophet he didn't understand it but he
[1:22:27] was setting a scene for a rejected
[1:22:29] Christ
[1:22:32] here send the word of the Lord let it
[1:22:35] come now
[1:22:37] a lot of people don't understand what's
[1:22:38] going on
[1:22:39] why is this bright Gathering like they
[1:22:41] are why are they getting under the
[1:22:43] inspiration of Malachi 4 why are they
[1:22:45] moving to the sound of the music brother
[1:22:47] random said in Shalom he said it's like
[1:22:49] a great Symphony he said to the old
[1:22:51] looker it's just a bunch of Racket and
[1:22:53] the only one that knows the secret to
[1:22:55] the symphony is the composer and those
[1:22:58] that are interested in knowing about it
[1:23:00] he said to those that are sitting around
[1:23:02] it oh they're hearing is a bunch of
[1:23:03] noise
[1:23:04] to all those that are sitting around on
[1:23:06] the outside all they hear is somebody in
[1:23:09] there praising God but in here
[1:23:12] but in here the Shekinah Glory is coming
[1:23:15] down they don't understand the sound of
[1:23:17] the symphony they don't understand the
[1:23:19] Beat of the Music but it's coming
[1:23:21] together
[1:23:22] you see you see what it is the composer
[1:23:25] wrote the symphony he knows the ideas of
[1:23:28] it he knows where it's got to go he
[1:23:30] knows who's going to play their part and
[1:23:33] if the director comes out there and he's
[1:23:35] out from underneath the inspirational
[1:23:37] composer and he starts paying play and
[1:23:39] Mary had a little ham when he's supposed
[1:23:41] to be playing Peter and the Wolf he's
[1:23:43] coming out to their own sheet music
[1:23:48] are you hear me today if they're
[1:23:50] preaching to you that the days of
[1:23:52] Miracles are gone they're not under the
[1:23:55] sound of the composer they don't know
[1:23:57] the junction that has came and at a
[1:24:00] junction Angels show up and miracles
[1:24:02] show up and Prophets Show up at a
[1:24:05] junction in time we are under the
[1:24:07] inspiration
[1:24:10] of the composer what is it the composer
[1:24:14] and the director's got to be in the same
[1:24:16] spirit
[1:24:18] I tell you what it's amazing it's
[1:24:20] amazing when you go to watch it one of
[1:24:22] them symphonies
[1:24:24] that little dude can take that little
[1:24:27] white stick tap it on the edge of that
[1:24:29] stage
[1:24:32] and bring chaos
[1:24:34] to order
[1:24:37] it's amazing how the inspiration of the
[1:24:39] Holy Spirit can come
[1:24:42] you had a bad day
[1:24:47] things messed up this week
[1:24:51] the air condition ain't right somebody
[1:24:53] sent me a Pew your hair didn't get
[1:24:55] curled right
[1:24:57] this humidity is just getting to me it
[1:24:59] ain't even summer yet
[1:25:03] but they all of a sudden
[1:25:05] get under the inspiration
[1:25:07] of the composer
[1:25:10] I didn't think that old dinky little
[1:25:12] director that's up there and he's just
[1:25:15] he don't know what he's doing
[1:25:18] but he gets under the inspiration of the
[1:25:20] composer
[1:25:21] and he brings all the sheet music
[1:25:23] together
[1:25:30] he's saying that I'm a part of the third
[1:25:33] pole
[1:25:34] he's saying out of the midst of this
[1:25:36] chaos in a time of trouble that he's
[1:25:38] going to hide me in his Pavilion he's
[1:25:40] saying unto me that he's the mighty
[1:25:42] Angel that's standing with me when I'm
[1:25:44] going through my crisis
[1:25:46] he's saying to me that I when I'm going
[1:25:49] through my worst of trials that I'm in
[1:25:51] the spirit of the word
[1:25:54] he's saying about me that when I'm going
[1:25:57] through laodicea that I'm believing for
[1:25:59] a body change even though I'm walking
[1:26:01] past people that's got blue hair and all
[1:26:04] kinds of different things all over their
[1:26:05] faces he's talking about me
[1:26:10] he's bringing all of my chaos of the
[1:26:12] week together
[1:26:14] I'm making it sound like that this is a
[1:26:17] people that is coming forward
[1:26:20] you're getting it
[1:26:21] you're getting it
[1:26:23] what is it all of a sudden those gifts
[1:26:26] that are sitting there the trumpet and
[1:26:28] the trombone and the and the tambourines
[1:26:31] Hallelujah and all of the snares and
[1:26:33] everything it's coming together the
[1:26:36] woods are coming together the string
[1:26:38] instruments are coming together
[1:26:41] what are they doing they're rallying
[1:26:44] around that gift
[1:26:47] what are you doing here
[1:26:50] believing that God heals cancer you're
[1:26:53] rallying around a gift what are you
[1:26:56] doing believing that God is going to
[1:26:58] change your body you're rallying around
[1:27:00] a gift you're not rallying around
[1:27:02] William Branham you're rallying around
[1:27:04] the Holy Spirit
[1:27:07] come on somebody that's the greatest
[1:27:09] thing that we could do tonight is not
[1:27:11] Rally around brother Ron or brother Tim
[1:27:12] or brother Dottie or brother Ed piscal
[1:27:14] but to Rally around the holy ghost that
[1:27:17] is the gift of all gifts he's the
[1:27:19] greatest thing that ever has been and if
[1:27:21] you can rally around it it doesn't
[1:27:23] matter your background it doesn't matter
[1:27:25] where you came from it doesn't matter
[1:27:27] what you're going to go through
[1:27:29] he's the Lord our God
[1:27:31] That Forgives all of your iniquities
[1:27:33] that heals all of your diseases
[1:27:41] what did Israel do when they were in the
[1:27:43] midst of trouble in the Book of Judges
[1:27:45] there was a man by the name of Samson
[1:27:47] that was four and a half feet tall that
[1:27:50] had the ability to destroy Giants
[1:27:53] they begin to Rally around him and it
[1:27:56] didn't make a liquor sense but he'd come
[1:27:58] in there under the expiration all right
[1:28:02] he come under the expression of the gift
[1:28:04] that God put on the inside of him
[1:28:08] what was he doing
[1:28:10] he was revealing to those Philistines
[1:28:13] the expression that God had put on the
[1:28:16] inside of him that I am the deliverer
[1:28:18] for Israel and what did Israel do they
[1:28:22] rallied around that gift and he
[1:28:25] expressed to those Philistines that he
[1:28:28] was even though he's four and a half
[1:28:29] foot tall even though he was a mama's
[1:28:31] boy had seven little curls hanging off
[1:28:34] the back of his head
[1:28:36] he was showing to those Philistines that
[1:28:38] I'm the expression of the Revelation for
[1:28:40] the hour that we're living in what did
[1:28:43] William Branham do in this hour he
[1:28:45] showed to us what the expression of God
[1:28:47] was for the Revelation for this layout
[1:28:50] of cnh
[1:28:51] and Samson beat down a thousand for
[1:28:54] listings didn't make a lick of sense
[1:28:57] but to him he heard the sheet music
[1:29:00] he was under the inspiration of a
[1:29:03] composer and he was working it out he
[1:29:05] was working the word out right through
[1:29:07] his body
[1:29:10] hallelujah what was William Branham
[1:29:12] doing he was introducing to you that
[1:29:15] this is the mind of Our Lord
[1:29:20] he was showing you
[1:29:24] that were living in door worlds
[1:29:29] bad days good days Happy Days sad days
[1:29:34] on the mountain in the valley but you're
[1:29:37] a duel
[1:29:38] spirit being
[1:29:40] you're built you're built to live in
[1:29:43] another world
[1:29:44] what did William Branham do he told us
[1:29:47] and taught us what the spiritual world
[1:29:49] was
[1:29:51] he told us he awakened us up to the god
[1:29:54] of the Supernatural and he said now many
[1:29:55] times you hear him say now he said no
[1:29:57] I'm standing here in Two Worlds
[1:30:00] it's amazing
[1:30:02] it's amazing that he could be sitting
[1:30:04] here sitting at the platform or sitting
[1:30:06] in his bed
[1:30:08] and he's in another dimension
[1:30:11] what was it
[1:30:13] I believe it's in
[1:30:16] forget the title of it but anyways when
[1:30:17] when brother Branham was standing there
[1:30:19] and he goes beyond the curtain of time
[1:30:21] and he goes there he's looking down upon
[1:30:25] his body
[1:30:27] I believe he said he wasn't 20 feet from
[1:30:29] his body but there he was in another
[1:30:31] world
[1:30:32] he was looking at that world that you're
[1:30:35] going to
[1:30:36] where that sister that was 90 years old
[1:30:38] that had just gave their heart to the
[1:30:40] Lord was standing there and it wasn't
[1:30:42] even 20 feet away now what was it he was
[1:30:45] showing to us that error was a discovery
[1:30:48] that there was two worlds that we are
[1:30:50] living in that we recognize that even
[1:30:53] though even though we're facing battles
[1:30:55] facing trials facing all kinds of chaos
[1:30:58] that we're wrestling not against flesh
[1:31:00] and blood but against principalities
[1:31:02] against rulers of darkness and spiritual
[1:31:05] wickedness in this evil age he was
[1:31:08] showing to us that we're not just facing
[1:31:11] Natural Things
[1:31:13] there's a lot of people that face
[1:31:15] natural things that they do on their own
[1:31:16] and I think man the devil's sure after
[1:31:18] me a lot of that's our own stupidity
[1:31:21] I mean to be honest you keep falling in
[1:31:24] the same trap that you went into that
[1:31:25] your own stupidity
[1:31:29] come on somebody if you fall in the same
[1:31:31] hole that you've been walking past all
[1:31:32] your all your years and you fall right
[1:31:34] back into it that's your own dumbness
[1:31:36] for walking into it but sometimes there
[1:31:40] is a spirit that gets behind you and
[1:31:42] pushes you in a hole
[1:31:44] that's an effort but he's showing to us
[1:31:47] he he's showing to us the ability to
[1:31:51] overcome that world That You Don't See
[1:31:54] we overcome him by the blood of the lamb
[1:31:56] and by the word of Our Testimony
[1:32:00] all right brother Brian I'm talking in
[1:32:01] question answer this week said brother
[1:32:02] random I'm a Christian I'm born again
[1:32:04] I've been filled with the Holy Ghost but
[1:32:06] I fight stubbornness he said if you'll
[1:32:08] go and study back all of your family
[1:32:10] history he said there's a line that lays
[1:32:12] there in your family they've always
[1:32:14] fought stubbornness
[1:32:17] I know I ain't talking to any of y'all
[1:32:21] because they know y'all stubborn now
[1:32:22] y'all just me come from Dean's family
[1:32:27] but if you go study it out
[1:32:29] he said it's from that all the way down
[1:32:31] there he said but he said it's like a
[1:32:34] tantalizing little snake it's always
[1:32:36] trying to get at you he said if you'll
[1:32:38] just walk away from it and leave it over
[1:32:41] there he said because James 4 and 7
[1:32:43] tells us to submit ourselves therefore
[1:32:44] to God and resist the devil and he will
[1:32:46] flee from you
[1:32:48] you see you've got an expectation that
[1:32:51] you can walk away from that by the word
[1:32:53] of the Lord you see all you've been told
[1:32:55] throughout your family history is this
[1:32:57] one's got anxiety and that one's got
[1:32:59] anxiety so I guess you'll have to deal
[1:33:01] with anxiety
[1:33:02] I don't believe that's the way that our
[1:33:04] sons and daughters need to be talking
[1:33:06] that our mama dealt with this or daddy
[1:33:08] dealt with this
[1:33:10] I'm gonna brag on my little alley just
[1:33:12] for a minute she's a little Christian
[1:33:14] she's got her faults and failures and if
[1:33:15] you don't want to know the truth don't
[1:33:17] ask her
[1:33:18] but one thing that she is she's a prayer
[1:33:21] Warrior I heard her in there the other
[1:33:23] day
[1:33:24] she was just tormented she's just
[1:33:26] tormented by by something that she that
[1:33:29] she deals with
[1:33:30] laughs
[1:33:31] some of us deal with that a lot keeping
[1:33:34] our mouth shut you know
[1:33:37] but she was standing in there
[1:33:38] she wasn't saying she was letting in her
[1:33:40] brother Chris saying I'm subject to this
[1:33:41] all my life I'm subject to this she was
[1:33:43] standing in there and rebuking that
[1:33:45] thing
[1:33:47] that's exactly way Sons and Daughters
[1:33:49] need to be well he said well that's just
[1:33:50] reality absolutely not you needed a
[1:33:53] break into a world that you start
[1:33:55] rebuking the things
[1:33:57] that keep hindering you in your
[1:33:59] Christian Life I'm not going to be
[1:34:01] subject anxiety I'm not going to be
[1:34:03] subject to the natural world I'm not
[1:34:05] going to be subject to depression I'm
[1:34:07] not going to be subject to alcohol I'm
[1:34:10] not going to be subject to that it's
[1:34:12] time that you serve notice on the devil
[1:34:14] today
[1:34:15] start rebuking the devil and tell him
[1:34:18] that he's underneath your feet
[1:34:20] if you expected you'll get what you
[1:34:23] expect in our Lord Jesus Christ what did
[1:34:26] William Branham do he opened our
[1:34:28] expectation to believe that all things
[1:34:30] are possible
[1:34:37] come on now If Abraham discovered that
[1:34:40] he was a shady eye you can discover that
[1:34:43] his health Shady eye
[1:34:45] if William Branham tapped into a channel
[1:34:47] that an angel would come and talk to him
[1:34:50] and said not even cancer would stand
[1:34:52] before your prayer
[1:34:54] you can tap into that channel
[1:34:57] what did he do he awakened our
[1:35:00] expectation
[1:35:03] many times you'll hear it you'll hear it
[1:35:05] I'm gonna burn them and I I've been
[1:35:07] searching for two days a story that
[1:35:09] brother bisco told
[1:35:10] us when we were there one time
[1:35:13] but I'll just refer to it I if you can
[1:35:15] find it I'll be sure glad because I
[1:35:17] spend countless hours looking for it but
[1:35:19] brother biscal told us one time he said
[1:35:21] there he said one time he said there was
[1:35:22] standing in front of a step brother
[1:35:24] Brandon would stand in front of a lady
[1:35:25] that was standing there and she was she
[1:35:27] was uh standing there and said you went
[1:35:30] to doctor after doctor after doctor and
[1:35:32] they can't find the source of what's
[1:35:33] wrong
[1:35:35] can't find the source of what's wrong he
[1:35:38] said but what it is he said when you as
[1:35:40] a little girl you fell down a well
[1:35:43] brother bisco said it in this way he
[1:35:45] said he said what caused it he said it
[1:35:46] loosed up when you fell it loosed up all
[1:35:49] of your organs
[1:35:51] and they've been looking for that
[1:35:54] and hear this girl had been suffering
[1:35:56] with this for years
[1:35:59] for years
[1:36:01] but now she's standing in front of the
[1:36:03] one that had discovered the problem
[1:36:06] now who was that where was William
[1:36:09] Branham operating in if he was operating
[1:36:11] outside of the word you and I wouldn't
[1:36:13] be here but because he was operating
[1:36:16] right with the word that little girl
[1:36:18] walked away healed
[1:36:21] you can go tell this time said doctors
[1:36:23] it's hid from the doctors it's it's hid
[1:36:26] from there but you Satan you can't hide
[1:36:28] from almighty God
[1:36:31] what is it Satan had been discovered
[1:36:36] like when when he's there in Africa and
[1:36:39] they they lead that man up there by the
[1:36:41] chain you know the story those those
[1:36:43] tears are dropping off of his his black
[1:36:46] belly he's in he said they're dropping
[1:36:48] off of him he's got he's not only got a
[1:36:51] infirmity in his body but he's lost his
[1:36:53] sound mind
[1:36:55] foreign
[1:36:56] and that boy in his condition
[1:37:00] begin to think about his brother that
[1:37:02] brother Brandon said was a city block
[1:37:03] away
[1:37:05] he said now I I see
[1:37:08] he said I see your your thinking you've
[1:37:11] got on your heart your brother and he
[1:37:13] said he fell off a yellow goat or a
[1:37:15] yellow dog and he's been on clubs all
[1:37:17] this time and when William Branham said
[1:37:20] that a city block away there come a man
[1:37:22] screaming all the way back there now
[1:37:25] what did he touch
[1:37:27] what did he touch
[1:37:29] his faith had made him whole
[1:37:33] that little boy in that condition had
[1:37:36] enough Faith to touch the master
[1:37:39] and in your crisis and in your trial
[1:37:42] when you didn't expect anything to come
[1:37:45] it's like brother Chris working on your
[1:37:47] house and all of a sudden you're hitting
[1:37:49] you're you're going after a nail and all
[1:37:51] of a sudden you you don't hit the nail
[1:37:53] you hit your thumb
[1:37:57] they hit your thumb you didn't expect
[1:37:59] that to happen
[1:38:01] but man you walked around shook it a
[1:38:03] little bit
[1:38:05] moaned about it a little bit but it
[1:38:07] didn't keep you from going back and
[1:38:09] hitting the nail again
[1:38:10] and just because you didn't expect the
[1:38:13] trial to come your way the way that it
[1:38:15] came doesn't mean that you stopped
[1:38:16] believing
[1:38:19] just because things don't happen the way
[1:38:22] that you expect them to happen don't
[1:38:24] give up on God
[1:38:27] man let me down this one let me down
[1:38:29] don't you give up on God because God
[1:38:31] ain't gonna give up on you
[1:38:33] that God his condition
[1:38:36] when he was sitting there and he'd been
[1:38:38] and he'd been used to make a living by
[1:38:41] dancing around but William Benham saw a
[1:38:44] vision over top of him but not only was
[1:38:46] he healed he came to his sound mind
[1:38:52] what was he showing us
[1:38:54] that our expectation can be awakened
[1:38:59] to the fact that God
[1:39:01] is alive
[1:39:03] again he said in Blind part of Mayors
[1:39:05] I'm going to go through a few things and
[1:39:07] I'm going to finish
[1:39:09] he said but he's dealing with the face
[1:39:10] he said do you believe that thou can't
[1:39:11] believe thou can't receive it have faith
[1:39:14] now just be real reverent you believe
[1:39:16] anything can happen oh I wish I could
[1:39:18] let my audience know what a feeling that
[1:39:20] this is to you scientists to you sue
[1:39:22] study scientific culture may I say it in
[1:39:25] this way that's The Fifth Dimension it's
[1:39:27] another world you go down a person's
[1:39:29] life only by the grace of God now here's
[1:39:31] another strange lady never seen or only
[1:39:33] Jesus knows the woman I don't never seen
[1:39:36] her in my life but he knows you if he
[1:39:38] will reveal to me what your trouble is
[1:39:40] will you accept it and believe it now
[1:39:42] the lady I see her going somewhere it's
[1:39:44] an examination it's before doctors
[1:39:46] they're giving her something another as
[1:39:49] a treatment it's it's it's a treatment
[1:39:51] for a dark shadow that hangs its cancer
[1:39:54] treating her for cancer and though
[1:39:56] though that it's made her really really
[1:39:58] nervous that's thus save the Holy Spirit
[1:40:00] he said now one thing that you are in
[1:40:03] your spiritual life you might that you
[1:40:05] might know that I'll be his servant you
[1:40:08] are always trying to reach up to
[1:40:09] something that you have never been able
[1:40:11] to get a hold of that's right and you're
[1:40:14] needing it and you made a promise to God
[1:40:16] by the side of a bed that if God would
[1:40:18] let you get well that you would
[1:40:19] surrender your whole life and being to
[1:40:21] him in prayer by the side of a bed
[1:40:23] that's right that's just save the Lord
[1:40:25] You're not from this city you're from
[1:40:27] another city Pauline is your name that
[1:40:29] is right Pauline you return home Jesus
[1:40:32] Christ has made you well surrender
[1:40:34] yourself to him and you'll be healed
[1:40:36] what did that patient discover that the
[1:40:38] almighty knew where she was praying at
[1:40:41] beside her bed asking to go forward
[1:40:47] you and I wouldn't be here
[1:40:50] if this message operated outside of the
[1:40:52] Bible
[1:40:57] but we've been discovered
[1:40:59] that William Branham
[1:41:01] was a man of God's word
[1:41:05] and I'm I'm gonna take a real hard turn
[1:41:07] right here but I believe it's for you
[1:41:12] but it's kind of like when brother best
[1:41:14] school
[1:41:15] my brother bisco tells in his testimony
[1:41:17] you can go listen to it brother biscal
[1:41:19] made those things available for us again
[1:41:21] and then I am a witness series
[1:41:24] but he tells that story about brother
[1:41:25] Branham as he's going up there and going
[1:41:27] after that brown bear you know the story
[1:41:30] you know that that brother Brown he
[1:41:32] missed that
[1:41:33] he missed where he was supposed to be at
[1:41:36] do you remember that that brother
[1:41:37] Branham had that vision of that brown
[1:41:39] bear that he was going to kill but it
[1:41:40] didn't get fulfilled
[1:41:42] it didn't get fulfilled because he was
[1:41:44] at the wrong place and he remembered
[1:41:46] that the Lord spoke to him and that
[1:41:48] Vision told him said go with those young
[1:41:50] young boys and he warned him three times
[1:41:52] go with those young boys he showed them
[1:41:54] three times in division go with those
[1:41:56] young boys but you remember when when
[1:41:58] he's up there and he's up in that
[1:42:00] country and he's and he's in that
[1:42:01] country and the panoramic looks like
[1:42:03] it's a surrounding of Alaska and
[1:42:05] different things and they're up there
[1:42:06] where brother Blaine or and brother Bud
[1:42:07] Southwick in there they're up there and
[1:42:09] they're hunting
[1:42:10] and and because brother Branham didn't
[1:42:13] want to hurt brother Bud's feelings
[1:42:16] when he said when he said Blaine you
[1:42:18] take Billy Paul and Eddie you go out
[1:42:20] this way brother Branham knew he was
[1:42:22] supposed to go with those young boys
[1:42:24] but he didn't want to hurt Bud's
[1:42:26] feelings
[1:42:27] and you remember that after brother that
[1:42:30] while Eddie's out there hunting they're
[1:42:32] out there they see that Mammoth brown
[1:42:33] bear out there
[1:42:35] he goes out there and he sees it he goes
[1:42:37] out there and he sees it and shoot it
[1:42:38] shoot it shoot it he said no I want
[1:42:39] brother Brandon to get something like
[1:42:40] this he ain't shot yet and they go back
[1:42:43] to the camp go back to the camp
[1:42:46] and it rains for the rest of their time
[1:42:48] out there and brother Brown said I'm
[1:42:49] ready to go
[1:42:51] now I'm taking a real hard turn right
[1:42:54] here but I believe it's going to bless
[1:42:55] you
[1:42:56] he said it went in there and brother
[1:42:57] Brandon said I'm ready to go and while
[1:42:59] they're packing up brother Brandon said
[1:43:01] Eddie where'd you see that brown bear at
[1:43:03] he said well I saw it back here and
[1:43:05] described it to him where he was and he
[1:43:07] went all the way back there
[1:43:08] to where it was and brother brother
[1:43:10] biscal said he he had this look on his
[1:43:12] face
[1:43:13] he knew that the Lord was dealing with
[1:43:15] and he went back there and he come back
[1:43:16] and he said
[1:43:17] I'm the reason when he come back he said
[1:43:19] I'm the reason for our trip he said I've
[1:43:22] been a Jonah
[1:43:24] I've been a Jonah he said but it's all
[1:43:26] over now and we're gonna ride out of
[1:43:29] here dry
[1:43:30] it had rained for three or four days the
[1:43:33] whole the whole country was completely
[1:43:34] wet the the biscal said that all of the
[1:43:37] trees were all the trees were dripping
[1:43:40] off with water he said I wouldn't be
[1:43:42] here today if we had a road out of there
[1:43:45] and we had a road out and getting wet he
[1:43:47] said but we rode out completely dry he
[1:43:50] said that's why I'm here today
[1:43:53] foreign
[1:43:54] but notice he said he said I've been a
[1:43:57] Jonah I was supposed to be with you
[1:43:59] fellas
[1:44:01] he said it's the second time that I
[1:44:03] disobeyed the vision the other time was
[1:44:05] in Africa he said but it's over and
[1:44:07] we're going to ride out of here dry
[1:44:09] and in 20 minutes time brother biscoll
[1:44:11] said it was completely dry he said just
[1:44:13] come a puff of wind
[1:44:15] and the whole panoramic was dried
[1:44:19] The sun hadn't shined for all them days
[1:44:21] but brother Brandon when he comes back
[1:44:23] and he preaches countdown countdown he
[1:44:27] comes he says so he said in these 30
[1:44:29] going on 32 years of ministry he said
[1:44:31] I've tried to stay true to the word of
[1:44:32] God he said I don't know one thing I've
[1:44:34] ever had to alter on because I I just
[1:44:36] read it out of the Bahama just said what
[1:44:37] the Bible said and let it go I like it
[1:44:39] like that he said so I haven't had to
[1:44:41] take back or rearrange it he said
[1:44:43] because I just said it the way that the
[1:44:45] Bible says it he said and I found out I
[1:44:47] find out if God has spoken anything then
[1:44:50] it we must go with that word in order to
[1:44:53] make it be fulfilled we've seen that as
[1:44:55] I told you last night of a vision just
[1:44:57] recently he said I had to be there and a
[1:45:00] warning to be there and telling me six
[1:45:02] months before me to be on that spot and
[1:45:04] stand there and saying go down there
[1:45:05] three times with them he said I just
[1:45:08] walked on with them other men and the
[1:45:10] vision passed right on through exactly
[1:45:11] God's part and he said I was left
[1:45:13] standing and he said so we want to
[1:45:15] remember you've got to stay on the word
[1:45:18] you've got to stay on the word just stay
[1:45:21] with the word and where the word leads
[1:45:22] and go right with the word then it'll
[1:45:24] bring you all right all right
[1:45:27] said if we wouldn't erode out dry he
[1:45:29] said I wouldn't be here
[1:45:31] but William Branham was a man enough to
[1:45:33] know that he'd missed the vision
[1:45:36] that the vision had it transpired
[1:45:39] exactly like it said it would but he was
[1:45:41] out of its place
[1:45:45] and sometimes we get our feelings in the
[1:45:48] way
[1:45:49] let me go a little bit further just for
[1:45:51] a moment we get our feelings in the way
[1:45:53] and think my goodness I only feel like
[1:45:55] I'm saved your feelings have nothing to
[1:45:57] do with your salvation
[1:46:00] just stay with the word
[1:46:03] salvation is not based upon your
[1:46:05] feelings it's based upon receiving Jesus
[1:46:08] Christ and as the Lord by faith your
[1:46:11] feelings are going to vary from one
[1:46:13] moment to the next moment Jesus went
[1:46:15] from the highest of feelings to the
[1:46:17] lowest of feelings he wept at lazarus's
[1:46:20] grave he understood the joy of getting
[1:46:22] people to receive him and receive his
[1:46:24] word but he went through it and he stood
[1:46:27] there when people rejected him when
[1:46:29] people spit on him
[1:46:30] the feelings didn't change who Jesus was
[1:46:35] I don't understand how some Visions are
[1:46:37] going to come to pass
[1:46:39] there's visions of the Lord has given us
[1:46:41] there's Visions as the Lord's given
[1:46:43] brother Ron and other brothers said
[1:46:44] there's no way that you can explain how
[1:46:46] it's going to happen or why or how it's
[1:46:48] going to work its way out
[1:46:50] but I'm not going to doubt it
[1:46:53] all I'm going to do is get in line with
[1:46:55] it and get into the spirit of it and if
[1:46:58] you're in the spirit of it you can
[1:47:00] expect that it's going to come to pass
[1:47:04] I can follow a man that tells us that he
[1:47:07] was wrong that he was in the wrong spot
[1:47:11] well I don't know about that I don't
[1:47:13] know if I can follow a man that's making
[1:47:14] mistakes how about you
[1:47:16] how many mistakes have you made how many
[1:47:19] times did you give up on God and change
[1:47:21] your mind how many times did you miss
[1:47:23] where the word said but you still came
[1:47:25] back because God is rich in his Mercy
[1:47:28] don't you doubt the vision don't you
[1:47:31] miss what's going on get into the spirit
[1:47:33] of it
[1:47:37] thank you
[1:47:38] Don't Mess what he did at Calvary don't
[1:47:41] miss what he's doing now get into the
[1:47:43] spirit of it
[1:47:45] foreign
[1:47:48] you get under the inspiration of it I'm
[1:47:51] done you stand up
[1:47:54] and finally you get under the
[1:47:55] inspiration of it everything's going to
[1:47:57] work out exactly like it what should it
[1:47:59] be
[1:48:04] that's right
[1:48:05] don't you try to move the Hat
[1:48:08] don't you try to make it happen
[1:48:12] well this one gave up on God and this
[1:48:15] willing participant ain't going to be in
[1:48:16] the vision because they said they don't
[1:48:17] want it to come to pass let me tell you
[1:48:19] God would do what he's got to do
[1:48:21] laughs
[1:48:23] I'll tell you it's a dangerous thing to
[1:48:25] give up on a vision
[1:48:26] it's a dangerous thing to give up on the
[1:48:28] word of God it's well I don't want
[1:48:30] nothing to do with that no more you
[1:48:31] better be careful God will raise
[1:48:33] somebody else up to put in the vision
[1:48:36] come on somebody
[1:48:39] well I don't believe that let me tell
[1:48:40] you God will raise up an Isaac or he'll
[1:48:43] raise up an Andrew or he'll raise up a
[1:48:45] ray Lambert he will raise up anybody
[1:48:48] that is willing to serve him no matter
[1:48:50] what
[1:48:52] let me take a look at your family
[1:48:54] history just for a moment every one of
[1:48:56] you got scars and complexes and mistakes
[1:48:58] but God said I'm rich in Mercy I'm good
[1:49:02] enough I have an expectation that they
[1:49:04] are going to make it
[1:49:07] God ain't concerned about his word
[1:49:09] working its way out he knows who's going
[1:49:12] to fulfill it
[1:49:15] I'm going to fulfill my portion
[1:49:20] What If Abraham say you know what
[1:49:23] I'm just too old for this
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:30] I'm too old for this I don't I don't
[1:49:34] too old

[1:51:20] out of my crisis
[1:51:22] comes the greatest miracles

[1:51:35] 13 years ago

[1:51:39] named Rebecca
[1:51:43] if I could have
[1:51:45] in that moment
[1:51:49] I'd have gave my own life for that
[1:51:50] little baby
[1:51:54] but God was working out the details
[1:51:59] that I'm sufficient
[1:52:01] for this life
[1:52:06] I don't know what we just tapped into
[1:52:08] but we tapped in some
[1:52:15] to me
[1:52:17] I'd have stood right here
[1:52:19] this pulpit and I stopped you
[1:52:22] I said don't go down that way don't

[1:54:14] prophet that stood there
[1:54:17] and said here's the problem
[1:54:19] there is a word that is a discerner the
[1:54:22] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:54:24] and it tells you that I am your answer
