[22:25] [music] Amen. Let's bow our heads and
[22:26] our hearts. To kind heavenly father,
[22:29] Lord, we just thank you [music] so much,
[22:30] oh God, for this wonderful and gracious
[22:32] opportunity, Lord, to speak to our
[22:35] heavenly father, our bridegroom, [music]
[22:37] our lord and savior, our everything,
[22:39] Lord, and our life, Lord. Everything we
[22:42] are, [music] Lord Jesus, is just because
[22:44] of you. Lord, we come and just humble
[22:47] ourselves before you in your presence.
[22:49] Lord, we want to thank you for all your
[22:50] goodness on our [music] lives and all
[22:52] your blessings, Lord, as we come to this
[22:54] season, Lord Jesus, of the year and the
[22:56] [music] the end of the year and facing a
[22:58] new year. Father, we just want to thank
[23:00] you for everything you've done for us
[23:02] [music] in this year, Lord. Your
[23:03] blessings that have just followed us,
[23:05] Lord. As as David [music] said, surely
[23:07] goodness and mercy will follow me all
[23:10] the days of our lives, Father. And I
[23:11] [music] believe we can all testify of
[23:13] that, Lord. Thank you for all your
[23:15] blessings, Lord, and all that you do for
[23:17] us. [music] How you protect us, how you
[23:19] provide, Lord. When we come against
[23:21] sickness, you heal us. When [music] we
[23:24] come against the trial, you make a way,
[23:27] Lord. You're your the never [music]
[23:28] failing presence of the Lord Jesus
[23:31] Christ is with his bride. And we just
[23:33] [music] thank you for that, Lord. We
[23:35] thank you, oh God, for coming down,
[23:37] Lord. And one day, humanity needed a
[23:40] redeemer, needed a savior. We were
[23:43] against an impossibility. An
[23:45] impossibility. There was no way that we
[23:47] within ourselves could get back to you.
[23:50] But Lord, even when there seemed to be
[23:51] an impossibility, Lord, you came, Lord,
[23:54] in a way that was just against ways of
[23:57] reasoning [music]
[23:58] that was an impossibility to man. But
[24:00] you came and you found a willing virgin,
[24:03] oh [music] God, to come and be born
[24:05] through. You made a way back and you
[24:07] were born
[24:09] a sinless, spotless lamb of God. Lord,
[24:13] that's where our faith is this morning,
[24:14] Lord. And you are the same yesterday,
[24:16] today, and forever.
[24:18] Lord, we appreciate your birth. And
[24:20] thank you for becoming [music] one of
[24:21] us. But thank you, Lord, that you didn't
[24:23] stay there. Thank you, Lord, that you
[24:24] didn't stay on the cross. Thank you,
[24:26] Lord, that you didn't stay in a tomb.
[24:29] Thank you, Lord, that you didn't even
[24:30] stay in heaven. But Father, you're
[24:32] [music] in each and every one, Father,
[24:33] that's been born again of the Holy
[24:35] Ghost. Lord, what a Christmas gift that
[24:38] you would give yourself to us, [music]
[24:40] oh God. That you'd be our comforter,
[24:42] Lord, in time of sorrow. You'd be
[24:45] everything we have need of. Truly, the
[24:46] greatest gift we could ever be given is
[24:48] the [music] presence of the Lord Jesus
[24:50] Christ. Father God, Lord, we just lift
[24:52] up all these requests to you, Lord. Many
[24:55] times Satan would have us just focus on
[24:57] [music] the problem and focus on the
[24:58] situation. But Lord, we want to shift
[25:00] our focus, Lord, on the answer. Lord,
[25:03] every request was serious and all the
[25:04] surgeries and the sicknesses and [music]
[25:06] all the situations of life. But Father,
[25:08] we want to confess that we believe and
[25:11] you are the answer to every request.
[25:13] [music] We lift them up to you even now
[25:15] in your presence and pray that you have
[25:17] mercy on the situations.
[25:19] We [music] thank you, Lord, for your
[25:20] goodness, Lord, to our pastor. Thank
[25:22] you, Lord, that you've brought him
[25:23] through another year. We just pray that
[25:25] you strengthen him, Lord, as he [music]
[25:26] speaks the word this morning. Lord, you
[25:29] know what he has need of in his body.
[25:30] Lord, you know, even more than the
[25:32] doctors do [music] exactly what he has
[25:33] need of. And Lord, you're more than
[25:35] able, Lord, and we just believe you.
[25:37] [music] We commit this service into your
[25:38] hands. Bless all the tithes and
[25:40] offerings. Bless the words as it comes
[25:42] for us. Forgive us of our sins. [music]
[25:44] And may we be more like you when we
[25:46] leave. In Jesus Christ's name we pray
[25:47] and ask these things. Amen.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; [music]
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. At this time, we're going to
[25:54] receive this this morning's offering you
[25:56] give as God's blessed you. I also want
[25:58] to just thank each and every one of you
[26:00] for the gifts that you've maybe given me
[26:02] and my family this year as God richly
[26:04] bless each and every one of y'all for
[26:06] that. What a wonderful time last night
[26:08] we had in the Lord.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; I tell you, the choirs and the little
[26:12] kids and the message Brother Andrew
[26:15] brought there, how special that was. I
[26:17] told brother Andrew uh I said uh after
[26:19] y'all sing that go tell it on the
[26:21] mountain. I was like Lord have mercy
[26:23] don't stop there.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; I thought they was about to break into
[26:26] you don't know like I know what he done
[26:29] for me
[26:30] &gt;&gt; I tell you. But uh we have Sister
[26:33] Chassity and Sister Kimley that's going
[26:35] to come and sing for us this morning.
[26:37] And uh then we got the Keglies again
[26:39] with us this morning. So, they're going
[26:41] to continue their singing uh this
[26:43] morning after uh Sister Kimley, Sister
[26:45] Chassity. And uh I I don't know if I can
[26:48] request this, but maybe I I'd like to
[26:50] I'd like for the choir to do that go
[26:52] tell it on the mountain one more time.
[26:54] It was just so good. [applause]
[27:02] So, if they if they wouldn't mind, maybe
[27:04] they can do that after brother Kegley.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing a song as uh
[27:09] they're receiving the offering this
[27:10] morning. Oh my goodness. I I had that go
[27:14] go go tell it on the mountain on my
[27:15] heart. Um

[44:35] There's just truly nothing like like
[44:37] Christmas.
[44:39] Just knowing how special it is to each
[44:42] and every one of us and this time of
[44:44] year. It's it's uh always a one of my
[44:47] favorite times of year. All the all the
[44:49] smells and all the good cooking. And
[44:51] Katie looked at me the other day. She
[44:53] said, "It's a good thing it ain't
[44:54] Christmas all year round." She said,
[44:55] "Cuz you'd be big as a hog."
[45:00] And that's probably true.
[45:03] I sure do enjoy all this good time and
[45:07] all the fixings and everything. And I
[45:08] want to appreciate all of the people
[45:10] here at Full Gospel Lighthouse for
[45:12] helping me get to look like a halfway
[45:14] hog here. So, I appreciate all the
[45:17] snacks and all the goodies and and every
[45:19] little gift card or God bless you. I I
[45:22] really do appreciate it and it means a
[45:24] lot. And if whether you give something
[45:26] or not, just to hear God bless you,
[45:28] that's that's enough for me. But we
[45:31] always take time and just give thanks
[45:33] for all the people here at Full Gospel
[45:35] Lighthouse. But I just just had it on my
[45:37] heart to I just wanted to appreciate our
[45:39] musicians here at Full Gospel Lighthouse
[45:42] and they uh
[45:45] [applause]
[45:47] Amen.
[45:52] They deserve every accolade that they
[45:54] have coming. And uh they they have the
[45:57] hardest job in the world trying to
[46:00] figure out what I'm about to sing or
[46:02] where I'm going to lead. And and uh I
[46:04] appreciate them. I appreciate sister
[46:06] Cassie, brother Randall, Sister Sarah,
[46:08] Sister April, Brother Greg, Brother
[46:09] Joel, Brother Jeffrey, and and uh all of
[46:12] the fill in, sister Phyllis, and Sister
[46:14] uh Deborah, and every every one of our
[46:17] young ones that are raising up that are
[46:19] I tell you what, we're a blessed church.
[46:21] And uh if you'd have been here Thursday
[46:23] night after our after our choir
[46:25] practice, and you would see what the
[46:27] future holds here at Full Gospel
[46:28] Lighthouse, you would go into Sackcloth
[46:30] and Ashes. And uh we had some kids get
[46:34] up here and got to playing and I I'll
[46:35] just be honest with you. I'm glad Titus
[46:37] is coming along to be the song leader
[46:39] for that. So,
[46:43] but I I I really [laughter] I'm just
[46:45] kidding. It was It was quite comical
[46:48] except for Sister Emma. We're going to
[46:50] keep her singing instead of playing the
[46:51] saxophone.
[46:56] But I I really do appreciate our
[46:58] musicians. I appreciate our trustees. I
[47:01] appreciate our deacons. I appreciate our
[47:03] pastor.

[47:10] Amen.
[47:12] [applause]
[47:16] The Lord has granted us six years uh
[47:19] with brother Ron.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Six years that we have cherished, that
[47:22] we have loved, and we have seen the Lord
[47:24] use him like never before. And Christmas
[47:27] time is real special to all of us. But
[47:29] this Christmas time is always real
[47:31] special to the Spencer family and for
[47:33] the past six years because it was
[47:35] December the 19th that there where the
[47:37] Lord spoke to him and then he got those
[47:39] news that he was diagnosed with cancer.
[47:42] And we look at a man and we see how that
[47:44] he has fought. And sometimes you just
[47:46] take it for granted that a man stands
[47:48] behind the pull pit and that he just has
[47:50] the resilience and the perseverance to
[47:52] keep going on. But the internal battles
[47:55] that a man faces, even though he is a
[47:57] spiritual man, he's he's a man of faith,
[47:59] he still battles things. And then to see
[48:01] a man like that has the tenacity to
[48:04] stand up and preach this message against
[48:06] every evil foe. I appreciate the man of
[48:09] God.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Not only is he my pastor, he's my dad.
[48:12] And I appreciate Brother Ron with all
[48:14] that is within me. And I know that you
[48:16] do. And we just want to say God bless
[48:19] brother Ron for all that he has done
[48:21] here at Full Gospel Lighthouse. We have
[48:24] a wonderful team of ministry here. And
[48:26] you see the leadership of Brother Ron as
[48:28] it's being poured out into these men
[48:30] right here. And we just we are very
[48:32] thankful for everything. Brother Brother
[48:34] Ron is not a selfish man whatsoever. He
[48:37] he shares his pullpit with us brothers.
[48:39] He allows us to minister and to preach
[48:41] the message of the hour. He puts
[48:43] confidence in us and he he loves these
[48:46] young people. what he he sees me doing
[48:48] with the youth. That is all that is I
[48:51] do. Anything you see me do, I run
[48:53] everything through brother Ron. We we
[48:55] are a wonderful team. And uh but brother
[48:58] Ron has his thumb on everything. And I
[49:00] appreciate him allowing us the liberty
[49:02] to be able to work with our youth and
[49:04] and then our our Sunday school, all of
[49:07] the all of the people that get to work
[49:08] with them. And we just want to say God
[49:10] bless our Sunday school teachers. And
[49:12] and I know it's a wonderful time. I
[49:14] always enjoy Sunday mornings walking
[49:16] watching those kids come in and and uh
[49:18] it's just a wonderful time. Do you love
[49:20] the Lord today?
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [applause]
[49:29] I want to just before we turn turn it
[49:31] over to brother Ron and change the order
[49:32] of the service, want to just remind you
[49:34] that we have our Christmas dinner next
[49:35] Sunday at the Whiters Cave Community
[49:37] Center and uh that'll be at 6 o'clock.
[49:39] We're going to have service that
[49:41] morning, typical Sunday morning service.
[49:42] And then later that evening at 6
[49:44] o'clock, we'll be at the Wears Cave
[49:46] Community Center. Amen. God bless you.
[49:48] Let's stand today as we change the order
[49:50] of the service. Um, Champion of Love. I
[49:54] think it's G.

[52:14] down. [singing]

[52:38] and he [music] is higher than the
[52:43] highest. is greater than the great.
[52:48] [music]

[56:35] prayers. And uh I don't want to do
[56:37] kidney dialysis because I won't be able
[56:39] to travel like I enjoy traveling. And uh
[56:43] and so we would we would like for you to
[56:45] pray for us that God would just be with
[56:48] us. Why would you do it? Well, I want to
[56:50] live.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; I really want to live and I I would like
[56:55] to live long enough to to see my
[56:57] grandbabies as they grow up and and
[56:59] enjoy them. And hey, it's worth fighting
[57:02] for. And so we we thank you for your
[57:05] your daily prayers and each and every
[57:08] one of you. And and uh we we so love you
[57:10] with all of our hearts. And and uh just
[57:13] remember us. He's been with us through
[57:15] through these all of these things. And
[57:17] now we go to the next phase. And you
[57:20] know when we realize when we take chemo
[57:22] for six years that it's going to destroy
[57:24] different organs and so here we are. And
[57:28] so it's destroyed a few organs already.
[57:31] But uh you sure don't want it to destroy
[57:33] your kidneys because they do a whole lot
[57:35] of work. And so uh we need help with
[57:37] that. And I thank God for people that
[57:40] that were able to invent uh kidney
[57:43] machines. Brother Canari called me this
[57:45] week and he just didn't know it. But I
[57:47] was right in the midst of making some
[57:50] decisions and so do I do it or do I not
[57:53] do it? And he just literally called me
[57:56] and he said, "Brother Ron, I want to
[57:57] give you some word of encouragement. My
[57:59] brother's 67 years old and he's had
[58:02] lupus much of his life and he's on a
[58:05] kidney machine and he does really,
[58:07] really well." And so, Brother Canard,
[58:10] let of God, thank you. Thank you so
[58:12] much. Amen. And before we won't you turn
[58:15] and just shake a few people's hand
[58:17] around you and
[58:19] God bless you. Merry Christmas.
[58:26] Amen.
[58:28] [snorts]
[58:31] Amen.
[58:32] Amen. You turn with me to Luke chapter 1
[58:36] and verse 26.
[58:41] If you if you wasn't here to hear
[58:43] brother Andrew last night, 35 minutes of
[58:46] of power dynamic speaking and it was
[58:49] wonderful and so I so enjoyed it and
[58:52] Amen. God bless you. Luke chapter 1 and
[58:56] verse 26.
[58:58] I want to speak today on the testimony
[59:02] of one.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:05] Our
[59:07] entire belief,
[59:10] the fundamental belief system that we
[59:12] all have hinges on the testimony of one
[59:17] person.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; And I want you to think about more than
[59:22] Mary, but you.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 1 and verse 26. And in the
[59:28] sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent
[59:30] from God unto a city of Galilee named
[59:33] Nazareth.
[59:36] to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[59:38] was Joseph
[59:40] of the house of David. And the virgin's
[59:43] name was Mary.
[59:45] And the angel came in unto her and said,
[59:48] "Hail,
[59:50] thou art highly favored. The Lord is
[59:53] with thee. Blessed art thou among
[59:55] women."
[59:57] And when she saw him, she was troubled
[59:59] at his saying, and cast in her mind what
[1:00:02] manner of salutation that this should
[1:00:04] be. And the angel said unto her, "Fear
[1:00:07] not, Mary, for thou hast found favor
[1:00:10] with God. And behold, thou shalt
[1:00:12] conceive, and in thy womb bring forth a
[1:00:15] son, and shall call his name Jesus. And
[1:00:19] he shall be great, and shall be called
[1:00:21] the son of the highest. And the Lord God
[1:00:23] shall give unto him the throne of his
[1:00:26] father David, and he shall reign over
[1:00:29] the house of Jacob forever, and of his
[1:00:32] kingdom there shall be no end." And then
[1:00:36] said Mary unto the angel, "How shall
[1:00:39] this be? See, and I know not a man." And
[1:00:43] the angel answered and said unto her,
[1:00:45] "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
[1:00:48] and the power of the highest shall
[1:00:50] overshadow thee. Therefore also that
[1:00:54] holy thing which shall be born of thee
[1:00:58] shall be called the son of God.
[1:01:02] And behold thy cousin Elizabeth. She
[1:01:05] hath also conceived and a son in her old
[1:01:08] age. And this is the sixth month with
[1:01:11] her
[1:01:12] who was called barren.
[1:01:15] For with God
[1:01:18] nothing shall be impossible. Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Now Mary responded here, "Behold the
[1:01:25] handmade of the Lord." These are
[1:01:27] powerful words. "Be it unto me
[1:01:32] according to thy word." And the angel
[1:01:35] departed from her. Let's read that last
[1:01:38] verse again together. And Mary said,
[1:01:41] "Behold the handmade of the Lord. Be it
[1:01:45] unto me according to thy word." and the
[1:01:48] angel departed from her. Amen. Maybe you
[1:01:51] have a need this morning. You just like
[1:01:52] to say, "Lord, come by and touch my me
[1:01:56] today." Father, it is in the name of
[1:01:59] Jesus, a name that is above every name.
[1:02:03] When it is called across the Virgin
[1:02:06] Mary's lips for the first time, a baby
[1:02:10] came to life in Elizabeth's womb. Now,
[1:02:13] dear God, we ask you that you you would
[1:02:16] come and be born in the manger of our
[1:02:18] heart today. We all have needs here. And
[1:02:21] Lord, we just thank you for what you
[1:02:23] have done in our lives. And I ask you
[1:02:26] that you would anoint and bless every
[1:02:28] person in this building, no matter how
[1:02:30] young and no matter how old. Bless them
[1:02:32] today. We pray in the name of Jesus
[1:02:35] Christ. Amen. And amen and amen. You may
[1:02:38] be seated.
[1:02:47] I thought I would just share something
[1:02:49] with you on a lighter note before we go
[1:02:51] into the word.
[1:02:53] [snorts]
[1:02:55] [clears throat]
[1:02:56] Brother Brandham enjoyed Christmas.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; You know, he enjoyed it. He enjoyed this
[1:03:01] time of year.
[1:03:03] [clears throat]
[1:03:05] My father was one that didn't enjoy
[1:03:07] Christmas, whether you realize it or
[1:03:10] not. Uh, it comes on every calendar.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; If you don't like it this year, it'll be
[1:03:20] back here next year.
[1:03:23] [laughter]
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; My dad was one that didn't didn't enjoy
[1:03:26] it. Didn't like it. And so, we were in
[1:03:30] business. I was in business. I was a
[1:03:32] chimney sweep.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; It's good luck if you see a chimney
[1:03:35] sweep. So, all of you people are really
[1:03:37] blessed.
[1:03:40] I was at Chimney Sweep for many many
[1:03:42] years and we had a company and it growed
[1:03:45] and we won the Golden Top Hat Award
[1:03:48] eight times during those years and uh we
[1:03:51] were just blessed with it. During
[1:03:53] December, it was a time to where that um
[1:03:56] people didn't want us to come into their
[1:03:58] homes and and we needed to we still
[1:04:00] needed to eat.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:04] Now, my dad my dad didn't appreciate
[1:04:06] this, but we we started a program called
[1:04:09] Keep Santa Clean.
[1:04:18] I would wear a red red coveralls
[1:04:23] and uh I would put a dollar in every
[1:04:26] stocking. And you know, those stockings
[1:04:29] grew through the years, you know, and
[1:04:31] we'd put dollars in and, you know, we we
[1:04:33] enjoyed it. Well, before long, before
[1:04:37] long, it kind of caught on over the
[1:04:38] years. It kind of caught on and why
[1:04:42] well, Christmas was booked all the time.
[1:04:44] December was booked all the time, you
[1:04:46] know. The kids enjoyed getting that
[1:04:48] dollar from the chimney sweep, you know,
[1:04:50] and [clears throat] and you know, as it
[1:04:53] would grow and as it would grow, we had
[1:04:57] some school teachers that decided, okay,
[1:05:01] we're we want the chimney sweep to come
[1:05:03] to our house. And we didn't realize it
[1:05:05] was going to be as big a deal as it was.
[1:05:07] And and uh we showed up to this house
[1:05:11] and there were school buses parked up
[1:05:12] and down the lane there.
[1:05:15] And I got out and uh you know I just for
[1:05:19] kicks I got it started and I'm on the
[1:05:21] roof and dad's dad's shaking all the
[1:05:23] kids' hands and he's he's doing all the
[1:05:25] teachers and it's a big deal. There's a
[1:05:27] video and we didn't have iPhones back
[1:05:30] then and I'm up on this roof at twotory
[1:05:33] roof and I'm up there and I've got a
[1:05:34] black brush and I got my top hat on.
[1:05:38] Now, [clears throat] this may blow some
[1:05:39] of your mind, but I started dancing
[1:05:42] across the roof, singing Jim Jiminy, Jim
[1:05:45] Jim, Jim Jim.
[1:05:56] Guess who enjoyed it the most? My dad.
[1:05:59] [laughter]
[1:06:04] Now he preach against Christmas but I
[1:06:06] was there when he was eating the cookies
[1:06:08] and the cakes and I was there and he
[1:06:09] would say thank God for cure Christmas.
[1:06:15] If you don't like it if you don't like
[1:06:16] Christmas you will get through it.
[1:06:19] Just take a deep breath. But we're going
[1:06:22] to enjoy it here.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; We're going to enjoy it. [applause]
[1:06:32] I thought you'd I'm not going to dance
[1:06:34] for you in this,
[1:06:36] but you won't believe how many dogs I
[1:06:38] had my picture taken with. And old Rover
[1:06:41] get to hug that with a chimney sweep, my
[1:06:43] top hat on, and brother Thomas, you know
[1:06:45] how it all works. And
[1:06:47] get TJ to dance on the roof. There you
[1:06:49] go. Get
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] Amen.
[1:06:57] Just turn to your neighbor and say,
[1:06:58] "We're going to have church."
[1:07:05] I'd like to speak to you today on the
[1:07:07] testimony of one
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; one. It's been used all through the
[1:07:12] scriptures.
[1:07:15] No doubt.
[1:07:17] You know, sometimes we think, well, if I
[1:07:18] had a hundred people around me that
[1:07:20] experience the same thing. Well, it
[1:07:22] don't work like that.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; It's individual. Amen.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Two in the field, one to be taken and
[1:07:28] want to be left.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Two in the meal, want to be taken, want
[1:07:31] to be left. Two at the meal, want to be
[1:07:34] taken, want to left. Two in the bed,
[1:07:37] want to be taken, want to be left. I've
[1:07:41] always prayed I'd be taken.
[1:07:58] We must come to the conclusion today
[1:08:00] that it's supernatural message.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; We must understand that this message has
[1:08:06] been visited by an angel, the Lord.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; We must also understand that God took
[1:08:11] his messenger when he was done.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Everything was delivered. It was
[1:08:17] orchestrated by God. It was from one
[1:08:19] sermon to another sermon to another
[1:08:21] sermon. No matter where Brother Brandham
[1:08:23] would be speaking at, whether it was in
[1:08:25] Switzerland or whether it was wherever
[1:08:27] it was at, it was it was just one right
[1:08:29] after another, every sermon seemed to
[1:08:31] build on each other. And the angel was
[1:08:35] always there.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; The angel that met him in a cave was
[1:08:41] always in attendance.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; And and and I want to just share this
[1:08:47] with you.
[1:08:49] He wasn't just in attendance with
[1:08:51] brother Brandham, but he's in attendance
[1:08:54] with message churches around the world.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had to leave, but now
[1:09:02] the message is with us.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; And the same angel of God is with us in
[1:09:08] attendance with us. Are you with me now?
[1:09:11] It doesn't matter where you see him or
[1:09:13] where you feel him. God is watching over
[1:09:15] this message. And every one of us have a
[1:09:19] story.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Every one of us have a story of how we
[1:09:25] got here.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; You may be the only one in your family.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; You may be the only one on your job. You
[1:09:34] may be the only one in your school.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would preach a sermon
[1:09:39] for you. One in a million.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; GOD PREDESTINATED YOU.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; And how much of we thank God that he
[1:09:50] predestinated us as sons and daughters
[1:09:53] of God
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; not to be a manger 2,000 years ago
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; but to be a living temple of almighty
[1:10:01] God.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; This is more than history.
[1:10:05] Amen.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; This is more than history where animals
[1:10:09] will be seen in manger scenes and and
[1:10:11] and let me just say this to you. We
[1:10:13] appreciate all of that, but I want to be
[1:10:15] the manger.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; I want to be the TEMPLE TO WHERE GOD CAN
[1:10:21] LIVE IN.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; It's great to have pictures on the wall,
[1:10:26] ornaments, statues. It's great to have
[1:10:29] all of those things, BUT I WANT HIM TO
[1:10:32] LIVE. AMEN.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; I WANT HIM TO PULSATE IN MY LIFE.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Now we understand when a prophet speaks
[1:10:44] uh God's vision and it becomes prophecy.
[1:10:49] No doubt Isaiah when he speaks uh behold
[1:10:52] a virgin shall conceive. Can you imagine
[1:10:55] how many critics he had?
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Now years go by.
[1:11:02] Now Isaiah passes off of the scene.
[1:11:06] No doubt all the false prophets and the
[1:11:09] false
[1:11:11] will come now to criticize him.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; We have ours.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; And they they criticized him. And that
[1:11:19] prophecy circled the earth
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; for hundreds of years.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; But there's an interesting thing about
[1:11:28] prophecy. It intercepts with time at
[1:11:31] some point.
[1:11:33] Now, she wasn't from the who's who,
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD PREDESTINATED a womb.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Let me just SAY THIS. YOU, GOD DIDN'T
[1:11:42] SEARCH HER OUT, search through all the
[1:11:44] women.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T SEARCH THROUGH THEM. HE KNEW
[1:11:50] WHO HE WAS coming to.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW EXACTLY. BROTHER RANDOM, YOU can
[1:11:56] go back and listen to it in Mary's
[1:11:59] belief. you know, she's a spouse to
[1:12:02] Joseph and and and and they went to
[1:12:06] service. The prophet will put put it
[1:12:09] kind of in a wonderful form. He said the
[1:12:12] rabbi
[1:12:14] opened the scrolls and he begins to read
[1:12:17] today his thoughts was was on Isaiah.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Behold, a virgin shall conceive. and he
[1:12:26] quoted it across his lips that had no
[1:12:29] doubt been read thousands and thousands
[1:12:31] and maybe even hundreds of thousands of
[1:12:34] times. But today,
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; BUT TODAY
[1:12:40] like David heard Goliath speech, it
[1:12:44] didn't matter to nobody else. Oh, they
[1:12:47] were afraid of it. But today, David
[1:12:49] showed up.
[1:12:51] today in a little temple. Mary came to
[1:12:55] her spot.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BAM SAID THEY WOULD GO HOME AND
[1:12:59] SAID, "JOSEPH had everything just
[1:13:01] right." Whenever I read that quote,
[1:13:03] Brother Terry, I think about you're a
[1:13:05] perfectionist and and you're a
[1:13:07] carpenter. You just have a way of doing
[1:13:09] things. I think about Joseph. No doubt
[1:13:13] how incredibly crafted his house was in
[1:13:16] preparation for family. Brother Brandham
[1:13:19] will say,
[1:13:22] I had somebody tell me one time years
[1:13:24] ago said, "How do you know, brother
[1:13:26] Brandham saw that?" I said, 'Well,
[1:13:30] how do you know what Mary what Eve's
[1:13:33] hair was?
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram tells us that Eve had
[1:13:40] blonde hair.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; And then he'll tell us that he watched
[1:13:44] he watched them walk out of the garden.
[1:13:49] He said the other night when I was
[1:13:51] preaching, I watched them walk out of
[1:13:53] the garden.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; So, I'd say he had a good idea.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. NOT JUST PAST, BUT HOW ABOUT
[1:14:00] FUTURE?
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE HE SAW US SITTING AT the
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; sitting at the table thousands of miles
[1:14:08] long.
[1:14:10] They were sitting at on a on a porch
[1:14:15] and they begin to rehearse what the
[1:14:17] service was like.
[1:14:19] Sun was beginning to set.
[1:14:23] And she said, "I just felt something. I
[1:14:27] felt something when the rabbi read that
[1:14:31] scripture. Behold, a virgin shall
[1:14:33] conceive."
[1:14:36] I hope we feel the same thing when we
[1:14:38] talk about rapture.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; And the next day,
[1:14:45] the prophet would say, "She's going to
[1:14:48] the well."
[1:14:50] No doubt a lot of people were going to
[1:14:51] the well, but today
[1:14:54] she would meet an angel.
[1:14:57] That angel no doubt standing about 6'
[1:14:59] tall dark complexed just cold black
[1:15:04] hair.
[1:15:05] Brother Brham would you know he would
[1:15:07] explain him so well
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; cuz he also met an angel of the Lord.
[1:15:13] Hallelujah. His deep set eyes how it
[1:15:17] would be. That angel be to speak to her.
[1:15:21] Let me just say nobody was in attendance
[1:15:26] of this conference.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU CAN SIT IN an audience of 300
[1:15:32] people and you are spoken to personally.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Take that very reverent AND SAY, "BE IT
[1:15:41] UNTO ME. LORD,
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; be it UNTO ME, LORD, ACCORDING TO thy
[1:15:47] word.
[1:15:50] Who is this Jesus?
[1:15:53] Can I just read this for you today?
[1:15:56] He came from the bosom of the father to
[1:15:59] the bosom of a woman.
[1:16:02] He put on humility that he might put on
[1:16:06] divinity
[1:16:08] that we might put on divinity. He became
[1:16:10] the son of man that we might become sons
[1:16:13] of God. He came from heaven where the
[1:16:16] rivers never freeze. Winds never blow.
[1:16:21] Frosts never chill the air. I want to go
[1:16:23] there, don't you?
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Flowers never fade.
[1:16:28] No one is ever sick.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; There will be no undertakers and no
[1:16:33] graveyards. And no one ever dies.
[1:16:37] No one is ever buried.
[1:16:40] He is born contrary to the laws of
[1:16:42] nature. lived in poverty, reared in
[1:16:45] obscurity,
[1:16:47] crossed the bound never only crossed the
[1:16:49] boundary of his land once in his
[1:16:52] childhood. He had no wealth nor
[1:16:55] influence, neither training or formal
[1:16:58] education.
[1:17:01] His relatives were inconspicuous
[1:17:06] and influential.
[1:17:08] IN INFANCY, HE STARTLED a king.
[1:17:12] In boyhood he puzzled the wise men. In
[1:17:16] manhood he rolled he ruled the course of
[1:17:19] nature. He walked upon the billows and
[1:17:22] hushed the sea to to sleep. He healed
[1:17:25] the multitudes without medicine and made
[1:17:28] no charge for his service. He never
[1:17:30] wrote wrote a book. YET ALL THE
[1:17:33] LIBRARIES of a country could never hold
[1:17:35] the books that have been read written
[1:17:37] about him. He never wrote a song. Yet he
[1:17:41] has furnished the theme of more songs
[1:17:44] than all the songwriters combined.
[1:17:48] He never founded a college.
[1:17:51] Yet all schools together cannot boast
[1:17:55] of as many students as he has.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; He never practiced psychology,
[1:18:02] psychiatry. Yet he healed more broken
[1:18:05] hearts than doctors has healed broken
[1:18:08] bodies.
[1:18:10] He never marshaled AN ARMY, DRAFTED A
[1:18:13] SOLDIER, FIRED A GUN. Yet no leader ever
[1:18:18] has found more volunteers,
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; who have under his orders made rebels
[1:18:24] stack their arms and surrender without
[1:18:27] firing a shot. Right?
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; He is the star of astronomy.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; He is the rock of ge geology. He is the
[1:18:37] lamb of God.
[1:18:46] How powerful is our God?
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; The harmonizer of all discords,
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; the healer of all diseases. Thank God.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Great men have come and gone. Yet he
[1:19:00] lives lives on. Herod could not kill
[1:19:03] him. Satan could not just seduce him.
[1:19:08] Death could not destroy him
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; and THE GRAVE
[1:19:12] COULD NOT HOLD HIM.
[1:19:15] [applause]
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; WHAT A MIGHTY GOD THAT JESUS IS.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would speak these
[1:19:35] words. He said a testimony
[1:19:40] before a person has has to have a
[1:19:44] experience before they can testify.
[1:19:48] If you were called to court, you'd have
[1:19:51] to have
[1:19:54] give a testimony.
[1:19:56] You have to know something before you
[1:19:58] can testify.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And a witness is a person who has
[1:20:03] seen something that knows that it is the
[1:20:06] truth and they are called to give a
[1:20:09] witness. A witness must KNOW WHAT HE'S
[1:20:13] talking about.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; He must not someone who told me certain
[1:20:18] certain secondhanded. Let me say it. He
[1:20:22] must be a witness himself.
[1:20:25] If not, he is speaking of someone else's
[1:20:30] and then he's not a true witness.
[1:20:31] [snorts]
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Let me just give you just a bit of a
[1:20:35] theme here. THERE WAS JOSEPH, THE
[1:20:38] HUSBAND OF MARY, and now he was engaged
[1:20:41] to a young lady and there and they were
[1:20:45] to be married. And then before they came
[1:20:48] together, she was found with child of
[1:20:50] the Holy Ghost. Now, we all believe
[1:20:53] that. That's what brother says. If we're
[1:20:57] Christians,
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; we all believe that.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; If we're Christians,
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; We must believe that in order to be a
[1:21:10] Christian, the Bible says that you got
[1:21:13] to believe every word in the Bible
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; to be a Christian.
[1:21:21] NOW, NOW BECAUSE IF IT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:21:23] is in here, it'll punctuate
[1:21:27] every word and every promise with an
[1:21:32] amen.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; NOW, BECAUSE JOSEPH WAS A JUST MAN, he
[1:21:38] was a good man. And no doubt that Mary
[1:21:41] had told him the visitation of Gabriel
[1:21:44] and how that she was to be overshadowed
[1:21:46] by the Holy Spirit and was to conceive
[1:21:49] and bear a son. and his name was to be
[1:21:52] called Jesus.
[1:21:54] How that she must have told him that to
[1:21:56] Joseph.
[1:21:58] And Joseph could look at her big brown
[1:22:00] eyes and he could see the innocence of
[1:22:03] it.
[1:22:06] Notice these next words
[1:22:08] and he wanted to believe it.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; He wanted
[1:22:17] to believe it.
[1:22:21] He wanted to believe it with all of his
[1:22:23] hearts.
[1:22:24] Yet it was too unusual.
[1:22:30] This is next to had to have been
[1:22:32] heart-wrenching.
[1:22:34] And he was minded to put her away
[1:22:37] privately.
[1:22:39] Now, if a man is sincere in it, God will
[1:22:42] make a way to show that man that it's
[1:22:45] the truth.
[1:22:49] He's obligated if you're sincere to see
[1:22:52] it and walk away.
[1:22:56] Then you're to be judged. BUT IF YOU'RE
[1:22:59] SINCERE
[1:23:00] and see the truth now, Joseph was
[1:23:04] minded. It's so unusual. That's the way
[1:23:07] it is today.
[1:23:10] PEOPLE, good men, fine men, good
[1:23:13] character men, fine ministers. Many of
[1:23:17] them priests and so forth are good men.
[1:23:21] But the supernatural vindication of the
[1:23:23] promise of this day is so unusual.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; IT THROWS THEM OFF OF THEIR BALANCE. And
[1:23:32] and it does that because it displaying
[1:23:35] the characteristic of God. And Joseph,
[1:23:40] her husband, BEING A JUST MAN, NOT
[1:23:42] WILLING TO make her a public example, he
[1:23:46] couldn't believe it.
[1:23:48] He tried to
[1:23:52] I want you to get that. He tried to.
[1:23:58] BUT WHILE HE THOUGHT ON THESE THINGS,
[1:24:02] THE ANGEL OF THE LORD, I think this is
[1:24:05] so powerful.
[1:24:06] THE ANGEL LORD SPOKE TO HIM and told him
[1:24:12] that he doesn't always speak in a dream.
[1:24:15] He can reveal himself to you by the by
[1:24:18] the word and show you that it's right if
[1:24:22] you're sincere enough
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; to look into it and to SEE IF IT'S GOD'S
[1:24:28] CHARACTERISTICS
[1:24:30] that's displaying itself. but always in
[1:24:34] every account with a promised word. And
[1:24:38] another thing, the word always corrects
[1:24:41] the error.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; I think that's so powerful.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; THE WORD
[1:24:49] ALWAYS corrects the error.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; THE WORD SETTLES IT.
[1:25:00] WHEN GOD VINDICATES THAT WORD, it
[1:25:04] settles it.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; You imagine having a conference with
[1:25:09] God. You and God having a conference.
[1:25:15] Remember, it's not you that called the
[1:25:17] conference.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; God called the conference.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Let me just say, you need to be so
[1:25:26] thankful in this season.
[1:25:29] that he revealed himself to you.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Listen, I want this church to be more
[1:25:37] than just a community of people.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; I want it to be more than just a place
[1:25:42] where we come and enjoy each other's
[1:25:45] singing and worship
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; and listen to a sermon. LET ME JUST SAY,
[1:25:51] I WANT THIS PLACE TO BE A SUPERNATURAL
[1:25:53] PLACE.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; CAN WE SAY IT? I WANT THIS PLACE TO BE A
[1:25:58] SUPERNATURAL PLACE
[1:26:01] TO WHERE GOD CAN REVEAL himself to you.
[1:26:13] [snorts]
[1:26:17] I've got a little fellow that sits here
[1:26:18] on this front row.
[1:26:21] He's he's probably one of the youngest
[1:26:23] guys here
[1:26:25] and he texts me every week.
[1:26:29] Brother Ron,
[1:26:32] you're my friend.
[1:26:36] Said something to me the other day. He
[1:26:38] said, "Brother Ron, I love you so much."
[1:26:42] He said, "I don't see how that anybody
[1:26:45] would not love you."
[1:26:49] He didn't know.
[1:26:52] He didn't know what that meant to me
[1:26:55] that day.
[1:27:04] You guys travel a couple hours.
[1:27:08] I want to thank you. Amen.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; I want to thank you from the bottom of
[1:27:13] my heart.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; I want to thank you.
[1:27:21] [snorts]
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I'm a little bit emotional
[1:27:22] this morning. It's a good morning to be
[1:27:24] emotional, isn't it?
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; The prophet said there was a time
[1:27:32] I'm thinking of somebody that met God, a
[1:27:35] little virgin.
[1:27:37] She had something to believe.
[1:27:41] Never been a baby born in the world
[1:27:43] without a father and a mother. We know
[1:27:46] that. So we find out that Mary,
[1:27:50] a little virgin
[1:27:53] on her road down to a well one day a
[1:27:55] great light shined upon be before her
[1:27:58] and she looked be standing there in the
[1:28:01] light and there stood Gabriel. The
[1:28:05] archangel said, "Hail Mary,
[1:28:08] blessed art thou amongst women and told
[1:28:12] her exactly [snorts]
[1:28:16] what was going to happen."
[1:28:19] Now, a few days before there,
[1:28:22] he had met a priest,
[1:28:25] her cousin's husband, Zacharias,
[1:28:28] and he was standing at the altar waving
[1:28:30] incense. And Gabriel appeared and told
[1:28:32] him that he was going home to with his
[1:28:36] wife and and have a child and was going
[1:28:40] to call his name John.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; AND THE PRIEST SAID, "HOW CAN THIS BE?
[1:28:47] I'm too old.
[1:28:49] It can't happen." No, it can't happen.
[1:28:53] And he said, "I'm Gabriel."
[1:28:56] and he sent and sent from the presence
[1:28:59] of God.
[1:29:01] My word will be fulfilling in their day
[1:29:04] and you'll be dumb till that day baby is
[1:29:08] born. Two different responses.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; One from a priest
[1:29:16] DOUBTING WHAT THE ANGEL SAID.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; BUT MARY HAD never preached A SERMON.
[1:29:24] SHE SAID, "BE IT UNTO ME
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THY WORD."
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; But here he comes to the little virgin.
[1:29:38] Zachariah Zacharias
[1:29:41] would have had plenty of examples for he
[1:29:43] had found out that there was Hannah when
[1:29:46] a baby when she was old. Sarah had a
[1:29:49] baby when she WAS OLD. PLENTY EXAMPLES
[1:29:51] IN THE BIBLE. BUT STILL HE WAS C
[1:29:54] cautious from it, callous from it. But
[1:29:58] Mary had to believe something that had
[1:30:01] never happened.
[1:30:03] But she had met God
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; and said, "How it will be, and the Holy
[1:30:12] Ghost will overshadow you, and thou
[1:30:15] shall and and this thing shall be born
[1:30:18] in you, be called the Son of God."
[1:30:26] And she said, "Behold, the handmade of
[1:30:28] the Lord."
[1:30:30] She had met God.
[1:30:35] I I love these next words. She couldn't
[1:30:38] hold her peace.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; She couldn't hold her peace. I IMAGINE
[1:30:44] SHE TOOK THAT JUG BACK TO the house and
[1:30:47] and took it out testifying everywhere.
[1:30:50] Her little cheeks were just fleshing
[1:30:52] saying, "I'M GOING TO HAVE A BABY.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; I'M [snorts and screaming] GOING TO HAVE
[1:30:58] A BABY."
[1:30:59] AND SHE went up INTO THE HILLS AND BEGAN
[1:31:02] TO TESTIFY TO HER COUSIN, I'M GOING TO
[1:31:06] [screaming] HAVE A BABY.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; AND ELIZABETH WAS CARRYING THAT BABY and
[1:31:11] it never had moved
[1:31:13] six months now. It had never moved
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; dead in its mother's womb.
[1:31:20] Mary begins TO GIVE THIS SALUTATION OF
[1:31:23] WHAT THE ANGEL had told her. She
[1:31:26] believed it with all her heart.
[1:31:30] And the most supernatural thing happens
[1:31:34] when she calls his name on earth for THE
[1:31:37] FIRST TIME.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; HIS NAME SHALL be called Jesus.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; And that baby in Elizabeth's womb
[1:31:48] shouted,
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; "RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; IN HIS MOTHER'S WOMB."
[1:31:56] LISTEN, GOD'S GOING TO DO SOMETHING. You
[1:31:59] have a supernatural testimony. You'll
[1:32:01] share it with everyone around you.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand this wasn't
[1:32:07] part Mary and part God.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; This was all God.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; It was all God. It'll be that way in
[1:32:20] your womb.
[1:32:23] Hallelujah.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; It'll be that WAY IN YOUR WOMB.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS TO HAVE ALL OF YOU.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; HE DON'T WANT PART OF YOU.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS ALL OF YOU.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Our surrender to God,
[1:32:39] BODY, SOUL, AND SPIRIT. GOD WANTS TO BE
[1:32:42] THE KING ON THE TABERNACLE OF OUR HEART.
[1:32:50] God became sin
[1:32:55] so that we could become his
[1:32:56] righteousness.
[1:32:59] God sent his son to hell so me and you
[1:33:02] wouldn't have to go.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Listen, for a believer today, it said
[1:33:09] over and over, "This is as close as
[1:33:12] we'll ever get to hell."
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Hell is a real place.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; It's said by Jesus more. He talks about
[1:33:22] hell more than even heaven. WHY WOULD HE
[1:33:26] DO THAT? HE CAME TO SAVE YOU FROM going
[1:33:29] there.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; HIS MISSION on earth being born into
[1:33:36] THIS REALM WAS TO TAKE CURSED EARTH.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? THAT WHEN WE WERE BORN
[1:33:45] OF THIS CURSED earth and our mothers ate
[1:33:48] our body out of the GROUND TO TAKE THAT
[1:33:52] CURSED EARTH AND BE BORN AGAIN
[1:33:56] [cheering]
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; WITH THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST LIVING ON
[1:33:59] THE INSIDE of us.
[1:34:02] [applause]
[1:34:14] Satan is always near when God's doing
[1:34:17] something.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; You know, it seems like when you're born
[1:34:21] again, all of a sudden, you start
[1:34:24] fighting against all kind of forces
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; that you didn't fight against when you
[1:34:28] were a sinner.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; There's a ear that you begin to hear
[1:34:33] negativity,
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:34:38] BEGINS TO TELL YOU, "YOU didn't meet
[1:34:40] God.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; God God don't love you. Those people
[1:34:45] don't love you.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Why would you go to church two times a
[1:34:48] week?
[1:34:51] [snorts]
[1:34:52] Why do you listen to a preacher preach
[1:34:54] for over an hour? You can go right down
[1:34:56] here and get a 15minute sermon.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU PASS ALL OF THESE OTHER
[1:35:02] CHURCHES?
[1:35:04] WHY DO YOU PASS ALL OF THEM? THEY'RE
[1:35:06] GOOD PEOPLE, BUT SOMETHING KEEPS HOLDING
[1:35:09] YOU.
[1:35:11] [applause]
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Every sermon THAT YOU HEAR, IT SOUNDS
[1:35:17] LIKE HEAVEN ALL THE TIME.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; I don't CARE HOW MANY TIMES I'VE COME TO
[1:35:23] CHURCH THROUGH all my life. I get
[1:35:26] something out of every service.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; I go home from these services after I
[1:35:33] preached.
[1:35:35] Listen, not everything's in note form.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; I go home and write down what I got out
[1:35:40] of it,
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Because I want to hold on to it.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; I want to hold on to every moment THAT
[1:35:47] WE HAVE WITH GOD.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; He bypasses a million to come to you.
[1:36:01] Now, let me just say in the supernatural
[1:36:03] realm, could I just say it like this?
[1:36:06] Mary couldn't explain it.
[1:36:11] She just couldn't explain it.
[1:36:14] Science couldn't prove it.
[1:36:18] Religion don't understand it.
[1:36:21] But the word overshadowed
[1:36:24] all of it.
[1:36:28] Mary ate like she normally ate.
[1:36:33] But there was something happening on the
[1:36:35] inside of her.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Let me just SAY THIS. YOU SOMETHING
[1:36:41] HAPPENS ON THE INSIDE OF YOU.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; You can't explain it.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; SCIENCE NO DOUBT CAN'T PROVE IT.
[1:36:51] RELIGIONS AROUND you don't understand
[1:36:53] the change that's taking place.
[1:36:56] BUT THE WORD WASHES YOU.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; IT WASHES YOU FROM THE RELIGION. IT
[1:37:03] WASHES YOU FROM THE SIN.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; IT WASHES YOU FROM ALL THE NEGATIVITY.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; And it begins TO GROW ON THE INSIDE OF
[1:37:13] YOU.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; YOUR HOME CHANGES, YOUR ATMOSPHERE
[1:37:18] CHANGES, YOUR SPEECH CHANGES,
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; YOUR MIND CHANGES.
[1:37:25] GOD GIVES YOU LOVE LIKE YOU'VE NEVER HAD
[1:37:28] IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; HE GIVES YOU A JOY.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; One angel,
[1:37:37] one message,
[1:37:40] one surrendered heart,
[1:37:43] and the word became flesh.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; God still works the same way today.
[1:37:52] He sends his word and gives his
[1:37:55] testimony
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; and looks for a believer who will say,
[1:37:59] "Be it unto me
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; according to thy word."
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Mary didn't question it.
[1:38:09] SHE DIDN'T ASK FOR CONFIRMATION.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T WAIT FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO
[1:38:13] AGREE. SHE SIMPLY SAID, "BE IT UNTO ME."
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Can I read it again? Mary didn't
[1:38:20] question it.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T ASK FOR CONFIRMATIONS.
[1:38:25] SHE DIDN'T WAIT FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO
[1:38:27] AGREE with her. SHE SIMPLY SAID, "BE IT
[1:38:29] unto me according to thy word.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:36] [applause]
[1:38:39] If these bones would let me dance, I'd
[1:38:41] dance."
[1:38:43] Come on.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; One brother Ron, one Noah
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; WITH ONE MESSAGE.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; ONE MOSES WITH ONE MESSAGE.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; ONE ELIJAH WITH ONE VOICE.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; ONE JOHN THE BAPTIST COM PREPARING OF
[1:39:00] the way OF THE LORD. ONE MAN standing on
[1:39:04] Mount Carmel.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; One William Brham.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; I'd like to say one Ron Spencer.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; One.
[1:39:25] [applause]
[1:39:30] Say it with me today and put your name
[1:39:32] there.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say one Ron Spencer. You
[1:39:36] call your name.
[1:39:40] Let's say it loud enough so the angels
[1:39:42] can hear it.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; WE'RE MARRIED TO ONE JESUS CHRIST.
[1:39:51] [applause and cheering]
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:57] [applause]
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; I'D LIKE TO SAY I BELIEVE.
[1:40:01] I BELIEVE.
[1:40:03] [cheering]
[1:40:07] AMEN.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; The prophet would say he never left
[1:40:10] himself without a witness. God always
[1:40:13] has a witness. And any man that serves
[1:40:16] Jesus Christ will not have many friends
[1:40:19] on this earth. You have to stand on your
[1:40:22] conviction alone. MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TO
[1:40:24] STAND BY YOURSELF.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; BUT HE PROMISED THAT HE would stand with
[1:40:31] you.
[1:40:34] Oh, glory to God.
[1:40:37] [snorts]
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; HE PROMISED THAT HE WILL stand with you.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; I'll be with you
[1:40:46] until the end [clears throat]
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; of the world.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Mary had to believe something that was
[1:40:55] totally impossible,
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; That had never happened before.
[1:41:01] SHE DIDN'T STAGGER AT IT. SHE JUST SAID,
[1:41:04] "BE IT UNTO me according to thy word."
[1:41:08] Mary said, "Behold the handmade of the
[1:41:11] Lord." And she started rejoicing.
[1:41:15] She was happy.
[1:41:17] God had promised it.
[1:41:20] [laughter]
[1:41:21] And she was she was going to have a
[1:41:24] baby. I believe I spoke something about
[1:41:27] that last night and we just heard it. I
[1:41:30] believe I spoke. HE SAID SHE DIDN'T WAIT
[1:41:33] till she felt it.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; She didn't wait till she felt it.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; I'm going to SAY IT AGAIN. SHE DIDN'T
[1:41:44] WAIT TILL SHE FELT IT.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T WAIT TILL SHE WAS POSITIVE.
[1:41:50] She didn't wait for any visible sign.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; SHE JUST BELIEVED.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; She believed what the angel said.
[1:42:06] [applause]
[1:42:07] There you are. The trouble is we want to
[1:42:09] question God.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; IF WE QUESTION GOD, WE CAN'T BELIEVE
[1:42:13] GOD. Faith is a substance of things
[1:42:16] hoped for, the evidence of things that
[1:42:19] you don't see, taste, feel, smell, or
[1:42:24] hear.
[1:42:25] Brother said, "I begin to feel a little
[1:42:28] bit religious right now."
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; JUST AS SOON AS SHE HEARD IT, FAITH
[1:42:37] COMETH BY hearing and by hearing of the
[1:42:40] word of God. FAITH COMETH by hearing.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; SOON AS YOU hear the WORD OF GOD, THAT
[1:42:48] SETS YOU FREE.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; BELIEVE IT. REJOICE WITH IT. GOD WILL
[1:42:55] SHOW THE EVIDENCE that you're accepted.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; You don't have to jump through a bunch
[1:43:02] of hoops.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ron, but I DIDN'T FEEL
[1:43:07] NOTHING. IT'S NOT BASED ON YOUR
[1:43:09] FEELINGS.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; DO YOU believe it?
[1:43:19] [applause]
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT'S NOT BASED ON
[1:43:31] YOUR UNDERSTANDING.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; The scripture SAID, "LEAN NOT TO YOUR
[1:43:35] OWN UNDERSTANDING."
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT A PUZZLE WHERE YOU PUT ALL
[1:43:40] THE PIECES TOGETHER.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Along with believing comes new births.
[1:43:50] Along with believing becomes all kinds
[1:43:52] of emotions,
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Did I cry? Oh, I'd say I've cried many
[1:43:57] times.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Did I shout? Oh, I've shouted many
[1:44:00] times.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'd say that if you know
[1:44:04] when I was younger, I'd like to done a
[1:44:06] flip like brother Joel Forny.
[1:44:10] [gasps]
[1:44:10] BUT IT'S NOT BASED ON MY HUMAN EMOTIONS.
[1:44:14] BECAUSE IF IT'S BASED ON YOUR HUMAN
[1:44:16] EMOTIONS, THERE WILL COME A TIME when
[1:44:18] you don't feel it.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; BUT IF IT'S ANCHORED IN YOUR HEART,
[1:44:31] ONCE IT'S ANCHORED, THERE'S NO GOING
[1:44:34] BACK.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; NOW,
[1:44:42] let me just leave my notes for a few
[1:44:43] moments. Listen,
[1:44:46] as long as her belly was flat,
[1:44:49] there wasn't a whole lot of criticism,
[1:44:51] just words.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; But when she began to protrude,
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; when she began to protrude,
[1:45:04] I was thinking of this sermon the other
[1:45:06] day.
[1:45:08] These notes have been here for for weeks
[1:45:10] now.
[1:45:13] Am I kidding doctor? She probably weighs
[1:45:16] 110 pounds.
[1:45:19] She's going to have a baby in February.
[1:45:23] Listen, you don't have to guess where
[1:45:24] she's pregnant or not.
[1:45:29] She said, "Now, Ron, I'm not going to be
[1:45:32] your doctor in February. I'm going to be
[1:45:34] off for a few days,
[1:45:36] but I'll have somebody to be watching
[1:45:38] over you. I'm going to be off for a few
[1:45:41] days." Listen, I didn't have to hear
[1:45:43] those words.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; I knew
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; she's pregnant, baby.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; You couldn't put enough donuts there to
[1:45:54] make her look like that.
[1:45:58] Cookies and cream won't make her look
[1:46:00] like that.
[1:46:09] She'd been with a man.
[1:46:13] That's what happened.
[1:46:15] Mary had been with God.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Mary had been had a visitation.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; And it is now more than a thought.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; It's now an action.
[1:46:30] Something's growing on the inside of her
[1:46:33] AND SHE'S EATING HIS BODY OUT OF THE
[1:46:36] GROUND CUZ HE'S GOING TO FIX what Eve
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; messed up.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; He's not going to come as an angel.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO COME AS GOD IN human form.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; AND COMING AS A VIRGIN BIRTH, HE'S GOING
[1:46:53] TO FIX THE original sin.
[1:46:59] Come on, church. He's going to fix it
[1:47:02] all the way back.
[1:47:04] [applause]
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO FIX YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE
[1:47:09] IN SIN.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; HE BECAUSE HE WAS BORN
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S BORN
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; BORN TO DIE. HE'S GOING TO FIX
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; our lives.
[1:47:24] Amen.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:47:32] I know we don't like the government
[1:47:35] and it's coming tax season. The year is
[1:47:38] going to flip
[1:47:40] and especially for businessmen, they
[1:47:43] hate tax season.
[1:47:46] Just something about the IRS they they
[1:47:48] don't like.
[1:47:52] But that's how you have roads. That's
[1:47:53] how you have schools. That's
[1:47:58] that's how you have a lot of things.
[1:48:01] It's how you have Somalia.
[1:48:11] Some of you get it today. Some of you
[1:48:13] get it tomorrow. Some of you never get
[1:48:15] it.
[1:48:20] God knew that Joseph would never move.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; He would never leave leave Nazareth to
[1:48:28] go for that baby to be born in
[1:48:30] Bethlehem.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; You see, God had a place for that baby
[1:48:38] to be born. Right.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; He had a place
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; and he had to force
[1:48:46] he had to force Joseph to move.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Sometimes in the the biggest things that
[1:48:54] you hate,
[1:48:56] God's in it.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Some in your most difficult times,
[1:49:03] Brother Ron, God's in it.
[1:49:10] This guy over here last night preached
[1:49:11] me a sermon. And I went home thinking
[1:49:13] about it all evening. Brother Ron,
[1:49:17] if you have to be at diialysis,
[1:49:21] somebody's going to be there that you
[1:49:23] got to witness to.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; And you couldn't get to him any other
[1:49:27] way.
[1:49:29] Well, what he don't know, the guy that I
[1:49:32] that I witnessed to for 11 years at the
[1:49:34] Arsenal,
[1:49:36] five years after I leave the Arsenal,
[1:49:39] Roger comes to the Lord.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; I worked with him for 11 years. One
[1:49:45] night I was preaching on a Wednesday
[1:49:46] night and here Roger walks into the
[1:49:48] building, walks down the aisle and says,
[1:49:51] "I want to give my heart to Jesus.
[1:49:55] YOU DON'T HAVE TO PREACH TO ME ALL THE
[1:49:57] LAWS of the message.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; You did that for 11 years
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; now. ROGER WAS A GOOD GUY AS a Baptist.
[1:50:05] He was goodnatured. But listen, God
[1:50:08] caused me to have to work at a bomb
[1:50:10] factory for one soul.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Listen, he will send you THROUGH THE
[1:50:18] VALLEY TO get one.
[1:50:22] [applause]
[1:50:32] Brother Ron, you want truth? I want some
[1:50:34] proof. I want to see it. Okay. Six years
[1:50:37] I fought cancer. But the vision came
[1:50:42] before I was documented with cancer that
[1:50:45] I would go through the deepest trial of
[1:50:46] my life. But there WOULD BE ONE
[1:50:50] AT THE BOTTOM.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. of that pit standing there waiting
[1:50:54] for me to get there.
[1:50:56] Sister Melissa, would you stand?
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; ONE SOUL'S WORTH 10 MILLION WORLDS. ONE.
[1:51:05] ONE. [applause]
[1:51:13] Sometimes what looks impossible,
[1:51:16] GOD [screaming] TAKES YOUR
[1:51:18] IMPOSSIBILITIES
[1:51:20] AND BRINGS IT TO PASS.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Can I tell one more?
[1:51:34] [snorts]
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; I was called to preach your mother's
[1:51:40] funeral.
[1:51:42] She had been gone for several years.
[1:51:46] Sister Janetta called me
[1:51:49] and said, "Mom, want you to preach her
[1:51:52] funeral."
[1:51:56] When I got the call, I was just
[1:52:01] because there's a certain place in the
[1:52:03] road where I talked to her mother the
[1:52:06] last time. And every time I come across
[1:52:09] that hill going down through there, I
[1:52:11] remember our laughs together and our
[1:52:14] joys together,
[1:52:18] Sister Betty,
[1:52:23] and I [sighs] I actually question
[1:52:28] what's going to come out of this.
[1:52:31] I actually asked Connie, I said, "What
[1:52:33] do you think's going to come out of
[1:52:34] this?"
[1:52:37] I walked into the room, Brother David,
[1:52:40] where the family was gathered and
[1:52:41] Janetta hugged me.
[1:52:47] We had prayer.
[1:52:49] I quoted some scriptures.
[1:52:52] I walked into the funeral place where
[1:52:55] the service is going to happen. And as
[1:52:57] I'm walking and I turned in and looked
[1:53:01] and the Lord spoke to me and said,
[1:53:04] "Today
[1:53:05] I'm going to begin to deal with Janetta
[1:53:08] and she's coming home."
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I don't know if I believe
[1:53:15] that. It don't matter.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; I'm driving a point now. It don't
[1:53:20] matter.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; It don't matter. Don't matter where you
[1:53:24] believe it or not.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; I know. Amen.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; I know.
[1:53:30] [applause]
[1:53:37] And when she screams and when she
[1:53:39] dances, I know
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; it wasn't my voice. I know.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Sister Melissa, when I hear you sing and
[1:53:49] I see you sitting with Brother Tom and I
[1:53:51] see YOUR FAMILY, I I KNOW.
[1:53:55] I know. Are you with me now? I'm going
[1:53:57] to preach to you.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; ON DECEMBER THE 22ND, GOD SPOKE TO ME
[1:54:02] six years ago
[1:54:06] [snorts] and said, "IF YOU'LL TRUST ME,
[1:54:09] I'LL use you like never before."
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; I thought that was going to be a lot of
[1:54:15] different things.
[1:54:18] But six years later, I stand here
[1:54:22] and I've had a lot of difficult days.
[1:54:24] Amen.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; I I actually just call it the day to
[1:54:30] throw up. I call it the today called
[1:54:33] achy day. I call the day to where my
[1:54:36] head hurts so bad.
[1:54:39] Then there's good days. And I'll just
[1:54:41] say, "Wait till tomorrow. Tomorrow's
[1:54:43] going to be a good day."
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not a whiner. I'm not a complainer.
[1:54:47] And don't take it THAT WAY. BUT GOD'S
[1:54:49] with me. Amen.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Ron, I don't know so
[1:54:52] much about your story about an angel
[1:54:55] visiting you in your office." I GOT NEWS
[1:54:57] FOR YOU. I KNOW.
[1:55:01] [applause]
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; I know.
[1:55:04] I KNOW. AND THAT'S WHAT KEEPS ME GOING
[1:55:07] ON.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'LL TRUST ME, I'll use you like
[1:55:12] never before. I know.
[1:55:15] I know.
[1:55:17] [applause]
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:55:30] [applause]
[1:55:37] [applause]
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; You can stay standing. You can say you
[1:55:42] know
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; you know where GOD MET YOU.
[1:55:46] YOU KNOW WHAT WAS GOING on in your
[1:55:48] heart.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; You know when he met you in a certain
[1:55:51] spot. And the DEVIL CAN SAY ALL HE WANTS
[1:55:54] TO. AND THE DEVIL CAN COME AND CRITICIZE
[1:55:56] YOU ALL HE WANTS TO.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; You know.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew. You know.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; You know. I know the exact spot it
[1:56:11] happened. You know, brother Matthew, you
[1:56:14] know. Amen.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Matt Mar, I wasn't there with you, but I
[1:56:21] see the evidence of it.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; your daughter's GOING TO GET BAPTIZED
[1:56:28] TODAY. AND THE SAME GOD THAT LIVES ON
[1:56:31] THE INSIDE OF YOU can live on THE INSIDE
[1:56:34] OF HER. WHAT A DAY. [applause]
[1:56:48] We didn't plan this.
[1:56:50] Sister and Melissa, will you come and
[1:56:52] sing Mary? Did you know?
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; And the whole choir is going to stand
[1:56:57] and sing it with you.
[1:56:59] Cuz we know.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; We know. Turn to your neighbor and say,
[1:57:04] "I know that. I know.
[1:57:13] I know.
[1:57:16] I know,
[1:57:26] brother. That's a funny way to end the
[1:57:28] service. Well, I'll finish it next week.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; It won't spoil.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Have you enjoyed this weekend? LISTEN
[1:57:39] [applause]
[1:57:48] to more more than just lyrics. Listen to
[1:57:52] a miracle.
[1:57:55] Hallelujah.
[1:57:57] God bless you.
[1:58:31] Mary. [music]
[1:58:32] Did you know [singing]
[1:58:34] that your baby boy would one
[1:58:38] [singing and music] day walk on water?
[1:58:42] Mary, did you know
[1:58:45] that your baby boy would save our
[1:58:49] [singing] sons and daughter? [music]
[1:58:53] Did you know
[1:58:55] that your baby boy has
[1:58:59] [music and singing] come to make you new
[1:59:04] and this child [singing] that you
[1:59:07] deliver
[1:59:10] will [music] soon [singing] deliver you?
[1:59:14] Mary, did you know [singing]
[1:59:17] that your [music] baby boy will give

[2:08:27] She understands the importance of water
[2:08:28] baptism. What it is this day is a day of
[2:08:31] dedication of
[2:08:33] We witnessed the Holy Spirit deal with
[2:08:36] the McCloud family all the way from the
[2:08:38] oldest to the youngest.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Little Ella, her name means beautiful.
[2:08:45] In the Greek and English, it means to be
[2:08:48] a light and a torch. And I pray this day
[2:08:51] that she would be a torch for our Lord
[2:08:53] Jesus Christ.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Sisteraptus
[2:08:59] Christaptism.
[2:09:03] Lord Jesus, today is a very special day.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, we recognize that we have come to
[2:09:10] a time where children are after the very
[2:09:13] heart of the father.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, you said suffer the little
[2:09:17] children to come to you. We had a
[2:09:19] prophet tell us that when you would
[2:09:20] begin to deal with their heart, that's
[2:09:22] the time to baptize them. Lord Jesus,
[2:09:25] you have worked with our sister Ellen.
[2:09:27] And Lord, today is a wonderful day where
[2:09:29] we recognize that the angels in heaven
[2:09:32] are rejoicing over one sinner that is
[2:09:34] repenting. Father, we know what it's
[2:09:37] like on this side of things. How our
[2:09:39] hearts are rejoicing. I see these
[2:09:41] parents, their heart is just bubbling
[2:09:43] over. I cannot imagine how heaven feels
[2:09:46] this morning. We pray Lord Jesus that
[2:09:49] according to thy word Father as I would
[2:09:52] baptize her in this watery grave that
[2:09:54] you would baptize her with the fire of
[2:09:57] the Holy Ghost that you would be the
[2:09:59] light or the torch in her life father
[2:10:02] that when she goes to school when she
[2:10:04] fellowships when she is being a friend
[2:10:07] even maybe while she's just talking with
[2:10:10] maybe an elderly person she has such a
[2:10:12] sweet spirit I watch her Lord Jesus and
[2:10:15] I see that how she carries her mother
[2:10:17] spirit to talk and to minister and to
[2:10:20] listen. She obeys. She hears. But I pray
[2:10:23] that this would be different now,
[2:10:25] Father. Lord, I pray that you would use
[2:10:27] her in a way, Father. I pray, Lord,
[2:10:30] according to thy word, as I baptize her
[2:10:32] with water, that you'd baptize her with
[2:10:34] the Holy Ghost. You told us to go into
[2:10:36] all the world to teach and to baptize in
[2:10:39] the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
[2:10:41] Ghost. Peter grabbed that revelation on
[2:10:44] that day of Pentecost. And so, Father,
[2:10:46] According to that revelation, I baptize
[2:10:49] our little Ella Mlar in the name of the
[2:10:51] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:11:04] [applause]
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Praise him.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:15] [applause]
[2:11:16] That's what he come for. That's the
[2:11:19] revelation of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[2:11:24] Amen. Won't you just turn to your
[2:11:26] neighbor and say, "Merry Christmas."
[2:11:29] It is good to be in the house of the
[2:11:32] Lord this morning.
[2:11:34] Remember, we have a gift for each family
[2:11:37] as you're dismissed this morning. So,
[2:11:40] God richly just bless you as we're
[2:11:42] dismissed to sing. Go tell it, tell it
[2:11:46] on the mountain, over the hills and
[2:11:50] everywhere. Now go and tell it, tell it
[2:11:55] on the mountain. Jesus [music] Christ is
[2:11:58] born.
[2:12:00] Oh, go and tell it. Tell [music] it on
[2:12:04] [singing] the mountain. Over the hills
[2:12:07] and everywhere. [singing]
[2:12:10] Go. Tell it on the mountain [music] that
[2:12:15] Jesus [singing]
[2:12:16] Christ is born. I said go tell it on the
[2:12:22] mountain
[2:12:24] over the hills in every way. [music]
[2:12:29] Go take it on the mountain.
[2:12:33] Then Jesus [music and singing]
[2:12:34] Christ,
[2:12:36] God bless you.
