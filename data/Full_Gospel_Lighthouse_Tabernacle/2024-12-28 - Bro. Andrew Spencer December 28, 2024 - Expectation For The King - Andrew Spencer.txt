had and we know this season and the reason that we we have this season is you steep down from your from your kingdom to be able to come and be our kinsman redeemer Lord and I just ask that we would just all just not not forget that and just remember the reason and Lord I know that there's many that that during this time it's a it's even a it's a hard time of even depression there may be lost loved ones that's not sitting at the table or there's there's family that's gone or there's different reasons that would cause us cause depression to come in Lord and I just pray that you would just come in and just bring a sweep through the audience that we could just come into the go into the new year with a new Joy a new happiness and be able to fill us with the Holy Ghost Lord and that's what I'm asking in this season is what greater gift than to see a child or see a loved one filled with the Holy Ghost and that's what I'm believing tonight Lord I'm believing that you could just come in and touch the ones who are sick touch the ones who are fighting afflictions that that doctors are fighting TR struggles to just find a cure to or even find the answer to there's there's flu and different things that are hitting there's stomach bugs in this time that's that's causing ones to even have to go to the hospital and and get fluids Lord I just ask that you would just bring us strength and we know that even in these times that's how we know that you're the Healer and if we don't get sick we don't see that your healing hand will come in and touch us and Lord we just thank you for all that you're doing and I just thank you for what you're doing for our pastor and allowing him to see another Christmas season and five years we're here Lord five years of Grace and I just believe that we're about to see a Healing Hand come through and sweep through his body and be able to touch each and every organ that Satan's tried to wipe out from his body to be able to see new cells be regenerated and we know that if limbs could be restored you can regenerate the cells within his body and we're just so thankful for all that you're doing and we're just thankful for what

it might look like nobody's else in the ring with us but you're always there father you said you never leave us and you never forsake us Lord we look back through the the traces of 2024 and we've seen you every step of the way you guided us to these moments we could look back and we could see the blood betrayal of Jesus Christ covering us when we don't have access and when the devil don't have access to the Sea of God's forgetfulness you have access to it and you can throw all of our sins in there you can throw all the things that we wish we could have done better in 2024 and we can look unto you the author and the finisher of our faith and father we are asking Lord as we get ready to close out these final moments I pray father that the Holy Spirit would just so envelope us with your presence oh god father wherever we have lacked wherever we have gone wrong wherever we just need a little bit of work we invite you father L into this place Lord you walk to a house and you weren't welcomed by a lot of men by a lot of the Sanhedrin and the scholars and the bigwigs of that day but there was a little bitty woman that welcomes you may you see that little bitty woman in this building tonight the Bride of Jesus Christ that has welcomed you and washed your feet oh God I pray that you would just come tonight and you would Minister To Us by the preaching of Thy word now father I've studied these quotes over and over and over again I've memorized them I've looked at them I've read scriptures but Lord I'm asking for that super anointing to that come sweeping down through Sportsman holla and brought a prophet just a just a charge of the Holy Ghost I'm asking for a super anointing to come and charge this little body of Believers here in Elton Virginia Lord that you would do something very special here tonight you have dealt with me specifically about this meeting tonight and I pray that we'd be looking for you tonight we just be really looking for you we just forget about the things of the world and lay aside everything and just turn our heart towards you just now if you have something for us in this service we want to find it with everything that's within us God we give you this service in Jesus name amen and amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over into a few portions of scripture Matthew chapter 2 verse one also the book of Psalms chapter 62 and also the book of Romans chapter 8 hallelujah hallelujah brother brandham said this in and why had to be Shepherds in 1964 it would be his last Christmas message to to the body of Believers he said this and I it struck me so powerful brother R said where is he that's born King of the Jews he said we saw his star in the east and that and that great religious Capital he said after two years of the shepherd's message still didn't have the answer or know nothing about it the head of all the denominations didn't have the answer to think that when when the wise men find him they don't find a little bitty baby but they find a 2-year-old but here these shepherds are carrying this message he didn't choose the greates of the world to carry it but he chose humble Shepherds to carry that message and there they were out there in that field and they were carrying that message and They carried it all the way through them cities and they still didn't have an answer for it now the Bible said in Matthew 2 and 1 now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship Him Psalms chapter 62 and verse 5 still a little bit muffled here I love this this one verse right here it's so powerful because because the writer he is not he's not saying that he's relying on his fellow men or he's not even relying on himself but he is relying on God Almighty in verse 5 it says my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him it matters where you get your expectation from Romans chapter 8 verse 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same and hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi the Redemption to with the Redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why do yet he hop for it but if we hope for that we see not then do we have patience to wait for may God bless his word you may be seated tonight here in the presence of the Lord and I'd like to just take a little thought this evening on the expectation for the king expectation for The King and I I just begin to ponder some things over the past couple weeks and just begin to just begin to ponder why why is it that God has a certain season or a certain time that he is that he's holding or he begins to release prophecy at that certain time why is it at this moment that we've read in the scriptures that we've we we've recognized our Lord's birth but why is it that he that he comes at that certain season and why didn't he come sooner and why maybe he didn't maybe my maybe why didn't he Terry just a little bit longer but God God we realize that the cogs of Prophecy they run very slow but they are always very sure and when God finds that all the elements of Prophecy have come into position then God begins to say all things are ready now and we realize that when whenever God says something in the promise or in Prophecy we realize that it causes an expectation on the on the inside of a Believer to look for the Fulfillment of that of that scripture as it's coming to pass now Webster tells us that expectation it is the act of of of looking forward to a future event with at least some reason to believe that the event will happen he says that the expectation differs from Hope because hope originates in desire and it may exist with little to no ground uh of belief that the desired event will arrive he said but expectation is founded on reasons and beliefs which rendered the event probable and I I think it I think it's very very fundamental that we realize that our expectations that we have in the Lord that they have a foundation on which they are built upon that we're not just here hoping for something and in vain of thinking it's going to happen but we have an expectation from the Lord that will be met I could say it to you like this what if I told you that in this sermon tonight it has the ability to change your destiny it has the ability to change your mind to loose you to set you free to heal your body if I told you those things if I if I told you those things it would heighten your expectation to to expect the supernatural in this place you would begin to look for it if I begin to tell you that this could happen that that brother Ron could get his healing right now sister sister sister Anna could get a a real touch from the Lord Brother Denny could have receive a real promise from the Lord it would heighten your expectation in such a way that you would be looking for the Lord Jesus just to maybe come down a different avenue that maybe he wouldn't wouldn't necessarily come down but all of a sudden because of a word from the Lord it heightens your expectation that the moment that we have been looking for is in the building you see you see real we realize that sometimes that a minister of God doesn't even realize sometimes what he is saying he but simply he's being led by the spirit of almighty God it doesn't even realize that it's that it's prophecy that is coming out of his mouth and all of a sudden prophecy strikes the individual that has faith and that Faith turns it into a real promise a tangible promise and no longer is it a a promise but now it's a possession that the believer can say I have it I I was expecting and I I believed it and now I and now I have it one time I was speaking at a camp and I was just I was just going down a line and the spirit of the Lord was leading me and I all of a sudden I started going and I started preaching about about God is a God that defeats cancer and he's he's that kind of a God in Zimbabwe and now now you know good and well I ain't never been in Zimbabwe and Zimbabwe is not necessarily that something that's on this old country boy's mind all the time but the spirit of the Lord was leading me down a little road but it was an encouragement for a sister that was in that building and she she was needing and at the beginning of that service the spirit of God said now today there's going to be a miracle in this place and it caused an A A A heightened awareness to be looking for the Supernatural and when that sister heard that word from the Lord she said that's for my mama that just got diagnosed with cancer over there that little woman that was all the way over there wasn't even a believer at the time but because of the word of the Lord she began to recognize that this was her moment and God healed her and God saved her and God is the kind of God that maybe you don't understand why a man of God is being led that kind of way but all of a sudden I'd say it was all of a sudden that Mary was walking down the road and she saw an angel step out I say it was all of a sudden that Peter was in an upper room and the Holy Ghost was poured out I'd say it was all of a sudden that William Brandon was in a cave and then an angel stepped in I'll say it was all of a sudden when brother Ron received his healing when he was in Uva and he was burned by a fire I said it was all of a sudden and I believe it's all of a sudden that our expectations can be met by the supernatural you say well does it really does it really mean anything when I begin to amen the word does it really affect does it really take effect when you begin to amen the word I'll say absolutely it does because it changes your your negative attitude and it changes your negative position and it puts you in line with the word of God where you wasn't already there when you begin to say so be it almighty God you begin to line up your faith with something that you're not supposed to have you begin to line up your faith with God's word and all of a sudden it brings a promise to you and you don't even realize that it's happening but a charge sweeps over your body I love what brother man was said in the in the adoption series he he he looks there and he said with Earnest expectation the whole creation is waiting for the manifestation he said now what is the manifestation he asked the question he said it's the making known he said now the whole world he said the muhammadans Over Yonder they're looking for it all around everywhere they're looking for it where is these people now the whole creation is groaning and they're waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God you see you see that word that is there in the Greek of upper cader it is the word of expectation and it is only used two times in the New Testament in Philippians 1 and 20 and in Romans 8 and 19 and Paul says according to my expectation and in my and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all build boldness and as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be be by life or whether it be by Death now when Paul he chooses this word in the Greek language he uses it with such power and intention because he's wanting to denote such a state of interest that is that that turns the believer's heart that their desire is for a certain object or a subject so Paul is very he's very instrumental where he places his word out and I find it amazing that he places it right there in the in the Book of Romans in the in that revelation of the adoption of a son being placed if you look at that scripture it depicts your entire life that whole chapter depicts the depicts the life of a Believer and when Paul drops that in there that the earnest expectation that the down payment of you hoping for and believing for it is showing something of intense interest that the believer is looking to fulfill his future inheritance now when you look at expectation in the natural and you look at expectation in the Supernatural or spiritual expectation can cause disappointments because when expectations are set too high and the reality doesn't meet your expectations you walk away feeling disappointed in it expectation can also cause motivation it it it when when expectation can Inspire an individual so that they work harder or strive to meet God's demands and and they begin to use expectation as a motivational Force but expectation can also cause you stress because when you have an high or an unrealistic expectation it can C it can cause a potential a a potential a affecting your mental health in such a way because you have these expectations and because they don't get met because you set them by human standards you begin to get stressed out and feel the pressure of maybe maybe this one maybe this one thinks I really don't believe because I ain't received my healing yet or I I ain't receiv received my promise yet but what really it is it is it is Hope instead of expectation but when you've got an expectation from God God has never let his expectation of a believing son and daughter of God fall to the ground and then not be brought to pass you see it it's kind of like it's kind of like at movie or that show that Andy griffi show that Opie you remember Andy got real mad at Opie one time he was going around and he was selling licorice seeds for for kids and Andy was getting all over op because because he knew he was selling them in vain because there's no such thing as liquor seeds and he was going around telling all these kids you're going to have these liquor seeds you plant these things you get your liquor sticks up and Andy knew he said he he knew good and well that he wasn't going to get no liquor stick so he's giving him false hope and I believe that so many times that that people have have been have been receiving false hope and they've been receiving something that that isn't going to come to pass but but you have receive something that that the world didn't give you and and the and the and books didn't give you because you see you were seed therefore you could be reborn you have not been sold a false hope that healing can come to you and that manifestations can come to you and that you can change your body by the power of Resurrection because if you've got that kind of expectation it will cause a result a result that will change your mentality from negativity to positive ity from sickness to health come on somebody from being broke to being the richest man in the city I'm talking about the kind of guy that don't even have enough money to buy a moped then all of a sudden you're rolling up in a Rolls-Royce because you got expectations not from a man but from a king it's powerful when you begin to expect something from a king now if you're expecting something from from a janitor you might end up with a mop you might end up with a broom but if you're expecting something from a king a king's going to give you something that only a king can give you a king ain't going to give you a chicken and a king ain't going to give you some he ain't going to give you some broke down Pinto he's going to give you something that only a king could give you so a king is going to give you a kingdom and a king is going to give you a crown and a king is going to give you King peace and King health and King wealth let me preach just a minute he'll give you a king's sword and a king's Revelation and a king's body change woo you see the reality of God's expectations will always lead to God Godly results you show me a time that the world let you down and I show you a time that he's always been faithful come on somebody you show me a time you show me a time where where Satan let you down or Leota let you down and I'll show you a time that he was always there you tell me a time where his mercies wasn't new tell me a time when he wasn't able to carry you through tell me a time that he that he was less than Almighty and I'll say it like this there's never a time but I'll say it like this but this is the time he was waiting for Mary to come to 16 year old old where she could put so she could bring for the son he was waiting on Isaiah to get to a spot that he could prophesy when nobody else would believe and but Isaiah had an expectation it wasn't my words that For unto us a son is given unto us a child is born it wasn't my words it wasn't my words that said that he should be a ruler he'll be a ruler of many nations and the government shall be upon then wasn't my words they come from another realm I love what Paul says in the book of Hebrews chapter 9 and 28 so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time I love what Brother Martin would tell us in the message he said he's appearing unto us for one reason he's wanting to reveal himself so he he's appearing in this season for such a Time Paul would say in the in the in the letter to in 2 Timothy 4 and8 he said For unto me henceforth is given unto me a crown of righteousness but to not to me only but to all them that love his appearing Hallelujah and when he comes he will come without sin under salvation the first time he came he had your sin on him but this time when he comes he'll be have no sins on him Hallelujah I love what brother random said an unbelief doesn't hinder God he said could you imagine a man being away from his wife for years a lovely sweet wife knowing that any moment that he'll appear and she's going to see him he said why her whole anticipation I sitting right on seeing him right at once just looking for him to appear at any time you can imagine the long in her heart you can imagine how how she was waiting on the sound of the horses coming down for her and when brother brandham comes and he preaches he preaches on the presence of God unrecognized and brother brandham is coming down he's coming down to the end of the end of the service and it begins to break into a line of discernment he said now he said if one of you if he would speak to you one or two of you he said then that would be infallible because in the mouth of two three Witnesses let it be established he said now how many would say that you recognize his presence and the whole congregation you can hear them saying amen I can imagine they was lifting their hands and saying amen he said now I love this because brother brandom said that is all that is necessary that's all that is necessary let me say it like this you don't need your bre your best friend to be sitting beside you all the time you don't need your pastor holding your hand and putting a pastor fire in your mouth all the time but if you can recognize the presence of almighty God that's all that is necessary come on somebody I don't need to feel a chill run over my back I don't need to have somebody lay their hands on me but if I can recognize the presence of the king that's all that's NE well you say what's necessary for my healing just believe what's necessary for a body change Hallelujah just believe that's all that's necessary well I believe we can preach a whole sermon on that that's all that's necessary now God will show you his will if you're looking for it and in every age he's always had a believer that has always looking for the Fulfillment of it because there was a man by the name of Simeon if you look at s he he is known as the god receiver that he had been talked to by the holy spirit that he was not going to taste death until he seen the Lord's Christ so brother Bon would preach a whole entire sermon on Simeon and he would call it expectation and here's Simeon the god receiver brother bam would say it like this he revealed himself to those that was waiting on him he said one of them was John the Baptist the Apostles of John the Baptist of Simeon and blind little Anna but it was the Holy Spirit spirit that was leading them to look for him and expect him I'd say that that morning as when Mary and Joseph walked down there on the eighth day to have Jesus circumcised before the high priest I'd say there was hundreds of babies that was walking in that Temple but what what caused the attraction there was something that was hanging to this little boy that was not hanging to the rest of them and it was a prophecy that had been laying there from the foundation of the world expectation has got to be have a foundation to it so the reason why you can believe you're going in the Rapture was because you have a foundation and that Foundation is he thought of you before the foundation of the world this little child had such an atmosphere about him that it calls the God re to go immediately to him I can imagine him passing through the prayer line and going directly to the need so this is what we've been looking for the king is here we waited for this moment and it's finally here brother maram said that God LED Simeon to his full expectancy I love what he goes on to say he said are you expecting to be healed tonight how many needs healing are you expecting to be healing healing tonight if you are the Holy Ghost has led you to the right place are you expecting it then be ready all things are ready everything's ready Isaiah prophecy is coming fulfilled what God speaks to the serpent in the Garden of Eden it's being fulfilled everything's coming to it's fulfillment and it's all coming together and and you may be not even able to wrap your your mind around how fast prophecy is coming to its fulfillment but it had had come to a spot that when Jesus was coming that there was three elect men that had been caught up in a in a supernatural meeting because they realized that there was a prophecy that was going to come into fruition where they were visibly going to see a star so they were looking for it and because balam said that a star was going to rise out of Jacob there was the three wise men these three wise men that were looking they were looking for him where is he at where's he at is he is he in this place is he in this church is he in this Hall is he in this denomination I read this to you a few weekends ago and brother M said he said what a striking event it is at this day that God has taken uneducated men boys and girls who probably have no more than a grammar school education has raised up by the power of the Holy Ghost that's crying in their ears of the church he's hearing this great power to unfold himself and to make himself known and the church knows nothing about it he said they come to give homage and they they come to give him homage and they come to give honor to the King of Kings they were not Kings but they were great enough to be honored guests of the king and they said where is he that's born King of the Jews he said the Bible said that all Jerusalem and Herod also were troubled their testimony stirred something it stirred something in all of a city it stirred something in all of el when when Dylan and Devon got saved it stirred something it stirred something when Chris Morris gave his heart to the Lord it stirred something when the thing that you've been looking for finally shows up you're no longer expecting it you're in the moment of it some of you look for the Holy Ghost maybe it seemed like you were looking for it longer than others were but when you got it you weren't expecting it no more it's like these little kids they were looking forward to the December the 25th because they were expecting that's the day we get to open the present but on December the 25th they didn't have to ask no more they were in the moment of it you are in the moment of Malachi 4 you don't have to ask for it no more you're in it you're looking for it and you're in it Hallelujah Hall it's worth going across hot deserts and finding out whether he's a true God or not this little woman had something on the inside of her that you heard about the wisdom of Solomon is that this same yesterday today and forever it was worth her to go across a hot desert on camel's back and she found out that he was the same yesterday today and forever that can't be more than William bram's Revelation that's got to be your Revelation it's got to be more than brother Ron's and it's got to be more than mine I tell you one of the greatest Revelations that you can have is that he's the same yesterday today and forever because if he did it in William brandom's day he'll do it in my day I know it's spold statements but I believe that a vision could show up in this room and change the mular status of your body and all of a sudden cells start changing and bodies start moving [Applause] you forgive me of my passion I've been eating on this it's who I am you can you cannot imagine what it's like for a man of God to stand here and realize that we're coming to the Fulfillment of it we've looked for it we've waited for it and now we're in it you cannot imagine my anticipation to watch you change brother Jerry you cannot imagine my anticipation to watch you change brother Stan you cannot imagine my anticipation to watch my grandmother Nancy change that the message that William brandom carried that the message at Homer Fraser carried that the message at Ron Spencer carried that the message that I've carried has had the effect on your life come on somebody you can't get your heightened your expectations heightened out there on chicken feed but something has heightened your anticipation to believe it you have had example after example to point two you have had Miracle after Miracle to point two but job did not have one Miracle job didn't have one letter job didn't have one script scripture but yet on the inside of him something cried out I know that my redeemer lives let me say this take my Bible from me take my mp3s away take my tapes take my iPad but you'll never destroy my expectation blessed be the name of almighty God somebody give him praise [Applause] brother manom would say it like this he would say now a starving child will eat it out of a garbage can if he's got two you ain't got two you got a seven course menu you can feed on but if you are starving to death brother Ram types it like Faith he said if you're starving to death and you just need a loaf of bread to cure your starving this he said if I gave you a quarter you could be as happy about that bread as you could be about that quarter and that quarter as you could be about that bread because that bread that bread cost a quarter and if you got that quarter you have the purchasing power of it now let me say it like this Faith ain't your healing but faith will produce your healing and you can be as excited about your faith that you believe he's the same yesterday today and forever as you have the baby BBE that's we we're jumping in your womb you can be as excited about the healing of your complexes if you got the faith you can be as excited about your body change as just because you got the faith of it you can be as excited about brother Ron's healing because you got the faith for it because that faith is an expectation that you don't know how and you don't know when but I know I know I know some of you been seeking some of you been asking your moment of expectation has met prophecy and the pillar of fire is here to prove that prophecy is a reality Ben Franklin had a c he got lit up one night and he said I got it but he didn't know what he had but it took a man by the name of Thomas Edison finally figured out what Ben Franklin was talking about the Pentecostals shouted about it and they said they had it but they didn't know if they shouting about but there's a body on Earth that knows what they're shouting about they know they got a right to speak in tongues they got a they got a right to Pardon they got a right to heal they got a right to the Holy Ghost I got it I think Terry edwell you sing that song I got it I got it ay something about the power of the Holy Ghost said I got it oh I got it come on somebody I know what I'm talking about this ain't just Homer Fraser's religion this ain't just Charlie Spencer's religion this ain't just William brandom's religion this ain't just James Wall's religion it's just mine I got it I got it I got it it's something about the power of the Holy Ghost and I got it oh I got it look at your neighbor and say I got it if you ain't got it come to a source where you can say I got it I got it I got it in the water I got it in my car I got it out there in the Pew I got it I got it I got it it ain't a hope so it's a [Applause] reality blessed be the name of the lord it's just another service for some people but for blind Bas he knew something was different about the town's talk and about the people shouting there was something different there been a lot of people walk by him but there something different about this guy there something that was there was something about the shout that caused his attraction to say thou son of David his expectation became a reality when his eyes come open let me say this there's there a lot of people that looked at this message for a long time and they was trying to figure it out is this really Malachi 4 your expectation was met when your eyes come open this is him this is the King's message this ain't some Kentucky boy this ain't some hillbilly that got this got this out of his mind he there's no way he could put these things together but your eyes began to come open to it he wasn't talking he wasn't lying about them squirrels he wasn't wasn't lying about that little girl by hady ride he wasn't lying about that storm up there in Colorado he was telling the truth because the reality of it is that same power is now in a body of Believers one of my greatest my greatest thoughts that keep that keep me just pondering Lord is said can you imagine his expectation that you're finally here some of you have moved you you left your homes you waited to get here but the reality of it is when you're settled and everything's just right in place you imagine forgive me I need to preach there's so many people that are blind to it there's so many people that are blind to it and they can't see it but for you it's a reality there was something there was something worth that Queen of the South going all that way there was something of you that made you raise your hand up brother mam said it in one way he said the reason why that lady raised up her hand the pillar of fire swept over her way there's a reason why you shout there's a reason why you amen there's a reason why you're under the ministry in Malachi 4 it's something that he has anticipated and now it's here no man gave you this seed this come from the mind of God brother mam said in a seven seal he said if you want to know what the mind of God is he said it's the supernatural what do you mean brother I'm saying it's kind of like this it was so unusual that Joseph believed Mary but it was Supernatural to to us it's supernatural but to God it's natural it's just natural for him to be Supernatural but for us wow you you imagine blind berus he sat there all of his life wow man I can't believe I've been sitting by this cruddy old wall where Joshua cast him walls down all the days of my life had William bham get that story he saw it happening how did William brandham start telling us about another St another city they saw it coming in and a bride in possession and some people say what are you so worked up about why are you so excited what makes you literally what makes you keep listening to it he's been dead for over 55 years now and there's a lot of people that blind to it there's a lot of people that was walking with Noah they didn't see no rain up here but he saw that rain there's a lot of people that was walking with Abraham he saw her he saw Sarah with a baby but the scoffers didn't see her with no baby come on somebody this star passed over every Observatory and they said well our wise men ain't seeing that but the three little boys for three wise men for three Magi for three kings they said we have saw his star and we are coming come to worship him well I don't see it like that well I do come on so I don't see this being the end of Malachi for a minute well I do I've met the same one that came in that car with Eddie bisco and William brandham and sat down in between them I have handled him I have felt the influence of that same Angel you say well I don't believe it I don't believe in Divine Healing the reason why you don't believe in it is because there's nothing continue to believe with you ain't going to get blood from a turnup because ain't no blood in there if you're going to get Faith from something you got to get it from something that's got faith in it so God put something on the inside of you that will produce what he's been looking for and it's the blood of Jesus Christ I'm so excited I could speak in tongues the rest of the night God deposited something on the inside of you because he knew that you would produce exactly what he was looking for Al a farmer ain't going to expect a harvest without planting a seed and God ain't expecting a miracle out of somebody that ain't got no faith what you saying brother Andrew I'm saying it like this that William brandham said that a man that lives by faith and walks by faith he said I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and he becomes a new Creator creature in Christ he said there's now there now you're getting into bride material when you begin to isolate yourself from all the things of the world and you begin to be made new Under the ministry and you begin to be made new and you become a new creature in Christ Jesus you begin to get in Bride material IAL and he said you're getting in a Rapture and conditioned in it didn't make a whole lot of sense when John Ryan is standing there and William Brandon pronounced that he was healed it didn't make a whole lot of sense to him that he couldn't see no more he he it didn't make no sense to him that he couldn't see yet and he got himself back in the line and you know the story and John Ryan said you said I was healed and William Brandon said you know you said that you believe me you see there's power in holding on to your confession whether your friends believe it or whether your doctor believes it or whether the high physician believes it or the professors of colleges believe it there is power into holding on to your confession Faith isn't about seeing instant results it's about trusting God and trusting his timing and it's powerful when you stand there and you say I don't care what I see I don't care what I feel I declare that I'm a Believer before Mary ever felt Jesus kick she was professing that she was carrying a baby come on sisters it's well I'm getting too old to start carrying a baby I read it in the message the other day there was a woman that William Brandon prophesied that she was going to receive a baby and she she be to doubt when the promise didn't come n and all of a sudden she got a sickness that come over her body and William brandham ran into her husband in another prayer line in a totally different city he said I see you you were already you were already prophesied that you was going to have you was going to have a child he said well that's true but my my wife got to hanging around certain people and they and around certain Ministries and they told her that that you was a liar and and she be to doubt you he said though the prophecy was a prophecy that woman was 52 years old and she gave birth to a 12 lb boy it's a big prophecy what are you saying I'm saying if God said it no matter what the scoffers do and no matter what they say well Glory Glory well [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah you're getting in Bride material then when you start isolating yourself well I still got preaching time praise God when this star begin to line up sham ham and J all of it begin to come together these three wise men start seeing the star brother brand in question answers he he begin to talk to us in 1960 he be to talk to us and he he tell us he said now he said in that time he said now who was that Earthly star he said it was John the Baptist he said now the star he said the star does not reflect its own light he said but the star is reflecting the light of that sun and he said when John the Baptist was come there he began to he began to move into himself he began to move in his ministry and he begin to reflect that light reflect that light of where and all all of a sudden because he begin to step into his ministry but it caused an expectation and the Book of Luke said it that when when John was up there on the banks of the Jordan River that the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin came in there and they started to ask him the Bible said that they begin to Muse in their heart that word muse if you studied out in the Greek it means to be absorbed with a thought that these men begin to be absorbed with a thought are you the Messiah are you the king they begin to ponder these things they begin to look at it with with a great intent with reasoning in their mind they begin to ask him are you he are we looking for another he said now look I'm going to baptize you with water but the one that's coming after me he's going to baptize you with fire and the Holy Ghost you see I got to decrease so that he can increase excuse me and brother Mar said that when John standing there he's standing on the banks of Jordan River and he starts proclaiming he starts proclaiming that he's a voice in the wilderness he's crying and brother random said it like this that it began to stir the whole world because John was preaching a true gospel he was preaching repentance and he was preaching he was preaching that the coming of the Lord was coming and he began to stir all that region you imagine whenever a light shows up whenever a star shows up it begins to it begins to cause an attraction and it stirred the San hedrin when the madb was looking for it and it stirred Jerusalem when John the Baptist was pointing to somebody greater than him and he started pointing to it and it stirred all the world you see something caught the attention just like the light struck that lens that light be to strike that seed that was on the inside of John the Baptist and it started to come to fruition everything that John was if it was P it was passion it was it was it was full of honor it was full of it was full of promises it was full of it was full of allmighty God and the people begin to look now if if this is Malachi 3 then surely we can start looking for Isaiah 7:14 if he's going to be the Forerunner then there's got to be somebody coming after him so they begin to look for him they begin to Muse in their heart now let me just go a little bit further if this is Malachi 4 then there's got to be somebody here if he if Malachi 4 had to decrease then somebody's here that that increased so if if if this is the ministry of Malachi 4 if this is him then it's a sure sign that the king is here so William brandom's Ministry though it might have seemed very humble in his in its beginnings and it started out just like a Kentucky hillbilly he couldn't say his words right and they made fun of him for saying Pulpit instead of ppit I started making fun of him that he didn't have the right kind of grammar and I'll tell you this you know none of that grammar ever bothered me it bothered a lot of people because it stirred the world to said well he ain't got the right kind of education he ain't got the ain't got the right kind of grammar to be able to speak to the high INF flutin that were really wanting to get but it didn't never affect you why because you see it stirred something on the inside of them that was Envy but it stirred a predestinated seed on the inside of you that light struck that lens but William brandom said that and the light struck that predestinated seed that was placed on the book that your name was wrote before the foundation of the world he said it struck that seed and it come to life he said just like that little bitty old woman that was a prostitute he said he said the light struck that seed I love what brother Bron said even in her condition right even in her condition even in her condition the light struck the seed and brother Ram said I love I love this message brother Ram said that when he began to talk to her and tell her about her condition tell about her husband brother forgive me brother random said he didn't have to say another word he didn't have to do another thing and all of a sudden she dropped her water pot and she said come see a man and all of a sudden that woman stirred the entire Community the light struck that seed the light struck that lens and the light has struck this generation whenever a star shows up this seven star that showed up in this generation has caused an attraction but it's also caused a stirring Don't Go Near there Don't Go Near That William brandom he gets off in the he gets off in the last part of his ministry don't you go near him he he does all right while he's under the anointing but let him get outside of that I don't know I don't know whether he is or not but you know the Cry of every every heart of every believer is they want the real Holy Spirit now let me get to it that's a cry let me get to that real holy spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost we read it in the Bible where is Jesus the same yesterday and today forever where is it we read that he's a great healer where is it we read that the holy spirit is for you and for your children and to them that's a far off even as many as the Lord Our God should call where is it in our churches where is that power that sets a church of fire that makes them turn off the television on Wednesday night and go to church where is that power that makes our ladies dress like women where is that power that sets a soul so on fire that he's out there on the field and he's constantly testifying to the glory of God that power is here that anointing is here this is more than just an anointing of Acts two but this the anointing of Acts 2 and Revelations chapter 10 you are under a dual anointing you are here the king is here I was going to hold this for next weekend but we're in a moment forgive me you see when the king is on his throne you can say surely the Lord is my shepherd beside me are still waters beneath me are Green Pastures before me is a table prepared between me and my home lies the Valley of the shadow of death behind me is goodness and mercy and in the distance awaits me the house of the Lord forever when God is your light you will Proclaim him as Savior and Lord you will bow on your knees and you will cry holy holy holy you will reverence him for he is unmatched in all of his power you will love him for his infinite wisdom you will trust him for his abundant goodness you will praise him for his overwhelming greatness you will believe in him for his unwavering faithfulness you will adore for him for he is perfect in Holiness the king is here they didn't catch it it stirred every rank of the religions of the world but it didn't shake them they thought he was coming for their King thought he was coming for their throne but this King was coming for a different Throne he was coming for your heart so King Herod wouldn't accept him the Sanhedrin rejected him but Shepherds received him because he could know that would say the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want this light that has been leading you it's not some ordinary light it's a lot of a king what would this lamp if it was getting if it was reflecting if it's going to reflect something it's reflecting the shik glory if it's coming from the shalana glory then it's got to reflect the shik glory if the light that is leading you is coming from a seminary then your light's going to reflect a seminary light if you got it in a Methodist Seminary you're going to reflect methodism if you got it in the Pentecostal Seminary you're going to reflect Pentecostalism but if you got it in the glory of God by the burning bush then you're going to reflect the burning bush the scriptures kept pointing that he is coming that he's coming and it calls anticipation that he was coming through the line of the tribe of Judah you see Moses spoke of it Micah spoke of it Matthew spoke of it Paul spoke of it John the Revelator spoke of it that he was coming as the lion of the tribe of Judah and William brandham said you are not into to an angel because God is requiring his Law requires a kinsman redeemer he said you're not kin to an angel he said but you you are kin to the line of the tribe of Judah what gives you the tenacity to stand here in the gates of hell it's because you are kin to the line of the tribe of Judah and you have a sternness in your life you have a firmness in your heart you have a bravery in your soul because you are kin to the lion of the tribe of Judah brother brandom goes on to say in the adoption series tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of God was ever going to be manifested outside of this time right now when was there ever a time in history that manifested time to deliver on nature nature itself is groaning it's waiting for the time of manifestation why before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out before the Old Testament on down there there could have couldn't have not been a manifestation it had to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of the sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ till it'll join him and his church together what is that Ministry when a little bitty old girl that had Al Capia that the ministry of Tim PR would stand there and say we are here to restore the glory of almighty God back to that little girl it was the manifestation of the king and the queen coming together what was it when when when when Doug Hill was sitting here and he died in a service much like this all of a sudden the king's Ministry and the Queen's Ministry come together and it was a manifestation what was it when Connie Mays was watching a stream and all of a sudden she felt so pulled when a man from Louisiana was preaching a message and she said I got to get in that building was that Aaron oglesby's Ministry or was that the king's Ministry come on somebody hallelujah hallelujah what was it what was it that turned my wife's womb when she couldn't have children but all of a sudden the king's Ministry come in line with the Queen's Ministry what was it when Dave Breeden was so wrecked up all of a sudden the king's Ministry and the Queen's Ministry tied together and you saw the physical manifestation of the king hallelujah how about every one of you that was backsliding on God you got cold on God you done gave up on God but the king's Ministry but the king's Ministry started working through an eve that would not fail that would not give up you are predestinated to live out this hour brother M was with one of his managers by the name of Ern Baxter I'm coming to this very special moment and I want your expectations to come to a heighten now I'm coming to I'm coming to the climax just now ER bter is with brother brandom and all of a sudden Ern backer Ern bter and William Brandon may see a man that's going down the street and er Baxter turns to William brandom he starts crying and weeping and throws his arm around William William brandom William brandom said what's all the fuss brother ER he said you see that's my king he said here he was ER baxer was a c was a Canadian he said if a Canadian could act that kind of way could act that kind of way about a natural King how much more his sons and daughters of God come on somebody he was God for Mariah proit that was nobody that wasn't Tim puit that was a king who was it that that raised Ron Spencer out of the hospital when he broke every vertebrae in his back that was my king who was it that raised him up out of fire that was my king who was it that gave me that gave me two little beautiful girls that's my king who was it that gave sister Whitney breeding her complete healing when she couldn't eat nothing she was on the strictest of diets where every time she would eat I'll just be very plain with you when she would eat she would get sick to her stomach and lose everything she ate but all of a sudden the king came in a tent and he manifested his glory who was it that night then Doug Hill got his healing it was not Ron Spencer it was a king who was it that restored you back to your rightful position when sat tried to rob you and feed you all kinds of Filth it was my king now if Ern Baxter could act that kind of way about a natural King what about your king what about your king what about your king what about your king I don't want you to know he's here he's here I'm not just telling you that by my emotions I'm not telling you that by My My by my sense of sight I'm telling you by by that by the word of the Lord that he's here my faith says he's here the anointing says he's here the word says he's here so the king is here well I don't know about all that shouting brother Andrew I don't know about all that thing I see a whole lot of bogus is about that why settle for a bogus when the sky is full of the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost you ain't got to be an unbeliever you ain't got to be a makeb believer but be a real son and and daughter of God yeah yeah brother brand said it like this he said you go to a basketball game and that basketball team their team starts winning they get up and they start shouting and they start praising and they start getting so excited he said there ain't no deadness in that Arena when their team starts winning he said but what about your king when you seeing him win the fight he said surely you can sh shout out and let him know that you appreciate the victory the King has went to battle for you surely you can appreciate the victory let him know let him know you appreciate the victory if they can do a little bit of cutting up out there surely you can do a little bit of cutting up in here come on this this is more than a natural King this is more than a president this is the king well I'm going to need more than that brother Andrew I'm glad you asked me he said you wait till that satisfying portion comes the satisfaction portion of the fullness of the Holy Spirit and it comes in with these Joy bells of shouting and speaking in tongues and dancing in spirit will come when that satisfying portion comes he said it will come you won't have to do it by the music you won't have to do it when you you will do it when you're getting down on the road in your car you will do it when you're sweeping the floor you will do it when you're driving nails in the wall wherever you are the joy is unspeakable and it's full of Glory you know I feel religious every once in a while I can shout yes sir you might
