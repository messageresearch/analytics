[5:24] still God and he's here to meet your
[5:27] need tonight a man to speak to your
[5:30] heart to minister to you amen so Isaiah
[5:34] chapter 53 verse 1 who hath believed our
[5:39] report and to whom is the arm of the
[5:42] Lord revealed for he shall grow up
[5:45] before him as a tender plant and as a
[5:49] root out of dry ground he have no form
[5:51] nor comeliness and when we shall see him
[5:54] there is no beauty that we should desire
[5:57] him he is despised and rejected of men a
[6:02] man of sorrows and acquainted with grief
[6:04] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[6:07] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[6:10] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[6:13] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[6:16] him stricken smitten of God and
[6:19] afflicted but he was wounded for our
[6:24] transgressions
[6:26] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[6:30] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[6:33] and with His stripes we are healed all
[6:38] we like sheep have gone astray and we
[6:40] have turned everyone everyone to his own
[6:43] way and the LORD hath laid on him the
[6:45] iniquity of us all he was oppressed and
[6:48] he was afflicted yet he opened not his
[6:51] mouth
[6:51] he has brought as a lamb to the
[6:53] slaughter and as a sheep before her
[6:55] Shearer's is dumb so he opened not his
[6:58] mouth he was taken from prison and from
[7:01] judgment and who shall declare his
[7:04] generation for he was cut off out of the
[7:07] land of the living for the transgression
[7:09] of my people was he stricken and he had
[7:13] made his he made his grave with the
[7:16] wicked and with the rich in his death
[7:18] because he had done no violence neither
[7:21] was any deceit in his mouth
[7:23] yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he
[7:27] had put him to grief when he went I'll
[7:30] shut make his soul an offering for sin
[7:33] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[7:36] his days and the pleasure of the Lord
[7:39] shall prosper in his hand he shall see
[7:43] the travail of his soul and shall be
[7:46] satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[7:49] righteous servant justify many for he
[7:52] shall bear their iniquities therefore
[7:55] will I divide him a portion with the
[7:57] great and he said have I'd the spoil
[8:00] with the strong because he had poured
[8:02] out his soul unto death and he was
[8:04] numbered with the transgressors and he
[8:06] bare the sin of many and made
[8:08] intercession for the transgressors and
[8:12] then let's go to Revelation chapter 3
[8:15] verse 14 we're coming to our church age
[8:20] that we are presently living in we're
[8:23] part of right now that a messenger has
[8:25] come to - to fulfill this part but this
[8:30] is our word this is the word the Lord -
[8:32] our age - our time and unto the Angel of
[8:36] the Church of the Laodiceans
[8:39] write these things saith the Amen the
[8:43] faithful and true witness the beginning
[8:45] of the creation of God amen god bless
[8:49] you can be seated I'm gonna be speaking
[8:53] tonight on who hath believed our report
[8:57] and we've got a lot of reports here
[9:00] lately and we have been with you every
[9:02] step of the way and as many has around
[9:05] the world and different places has and I
[9:10] personally have received many calls from
[9:12] different places questions things emails
[9:16] texts and so on from overseas and
[9:19] different ones as well inquiring about
[9:22] the needs that are here and our brother
[9:24] Ron and his family in the church here
[9:27] and and so we've received a lot of
[9:29] different reports that's for sure but
[9:33] this is a thing that he says in
[9:36] Scripture who have believed our report
[9:39] the doctors have a report and men say
[9:43] what they think and thinkin and what
[9:46] they know the best of their
[9:47] understanding but I'm here to talk about
[9:50] his report tonight now and I'm here to
[9:56] report of what the faithful and the true
[9:59] witness has to say the Amen of God and
[10:04] man they the faithful and true witness
[10:06] when we think of that you know God would
[10:09] come service after service after service
[10:12] to vindicate the word that had been
[10:15] preached as you know and discern the
[10:18] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[10:20] tell where people were from them with
[10:22] situation and what do what needs that
[10:25] they had their names address because God
[10:28] is just that kind of God he's a personal
[10:30] God and he cares about you and he cares
[10:34] about your needs so he would show
[10:36] himself over and over and over that he
[10:39] is a personal God and that he knows
[10:42] he knows everything before we even
[10:45] understand what the situation is he
[10:48] already knows what the situation is
[10:51] brother branham would say of this sum
[10:53] this particular scripture in the church
[10:56] age book he said these things say it the
[10:59] faithful and the true witness now I want
[11:02] to show you what I find in the thought
[11:03] of faithful you know we often talk about
[11:06] a great unchanging God whose word does
[11:09] not change and when we speak of him
[11:12] after that manner
[11:14] we often get a view of him that makes
[11:16] him seem very impersonal it says though
[11:19] God made the whole universe and all the
[11:23] laws that pertain to it and in stood
[11:24] back and became a great impersonal God
[11:28] and as though that God made a way of
[11:30] salvation for lost mankind that that way
[11:35] being the cross and then when the death
[11:37] of Christ is atone for our sins and his
[11:39] resurrection gave us an open door to him
[11:42] God's has folded his hands and stood
[11:44] back and it says if we have majored and
[11:47] believing in the Great Creator who being
[11:51] created have to create having created
[11:54] lost
[11:55] personal interest in his creation and
[11:58] they said now I want to say that's how
[12:01] many people are up to think but it's
[12:03] wrong thinking for God is governing in
[12:07] the affairs of men right now is both
[12:12] creator and sustainer
[12:17] and Colossians 1:16 says for by him were
[12:20] all things created that are in heaven
[12:23] and are in earth visible and invisible
[12:25] whether it be Thrones or dominions or
[12:29] principalities or powers and all things
[12:31] were created by him and for him and he
[12:35] is before all things and by him all
[12:38] things exists he's a sovereign God and
[12:41] by his own counsel he purposed the plan
[12:45] of salvation of his own elect which he
[12:48] foreknew and the son died upon the cross
[12:51] to establish the means of salvation and
[12:54] the holy spirit carefully execute the
[12:56] will of the Father and he's working all
[12:59] things listen now at this moment
[13:03] according to the purpose of his own will
[13:06] and he's right in the midst of all of it
[13:12] and he and he is in the midst of his
[13:15] church and this great creator Savior God
[13:19] is faithfully working among his own
[13:23] right now as the great Shepherd of the
[13:27] Sheep his very existence is for his own
[13:33] you're the reason he exists you're the
[13:36] reason he does everything that he's ever
[13:38] done is on account of you he's that kind
[13:42] of a God he's a personal God he's taking
[13:45] personal interest in your need and your
[13:47] situation your problem and what you're
[13:50] going through his eyes ever upon them he
[13:54] loves and cares for them what the words
[13:56] when the word says your lives are hid
[13:58] with Christ and God it means exactly
[14:00] what it says oh I'm so glad that my god
[14:04] abides faithful he is true to himself he
[14:09] won't lie he is true to the word he will
[14:13] back it up he is true to us he will lose
[14:16] none of us but raise us up at the last
[14:20] days I'm glad that I'm resting upon his
[14:23] faithfulness Philippians 1 in 6 being
[14:25] confident of this very thing that he
[14:29] will
[14:29] began a good work in you will perform it
[14:33] until the day of Jesus Christ so he has
[14:37] started to work he's gonna finish it
[14:39] he's not gonna abandon what he started
[14:42] and man he's right here to do his work
[14:45] in this end time in this day in hours
[14:48] according to his unfailing word that in
[14:52] that he begun a good work in his church
[14:54] in the first stage he will continue that
[14:57] work all the way to the day of Christ
[14:59] when he comes back for his church so
[15:03] then we we sometimes ponder you know has
[15:06] he lost interest and I just say how
[15:09] could he can he forget us the Bible said
[15:14] in Isaiah 14 I'm 15 can a woman first
[15:17] forget her suckling child that she
[15:20] should not have compassion on the son of
[15:22] her womb hey they may forget yep I will
[15:26] not forget thee behold I have grieving
[15:29] the upon the palms of our hands forget
[15:33] us why he left all the glory for us amen
[15:38] jesus came is the life Giver
[15:41] hey man and through through Adam of
[15:44] course came sorrow and pain and sickness
[15:46] and death but Jesus came to give life
[15:50] and life more abundantly amens he cannot
[15:54] forget what he's doing he cannot bring
[15:58] us this far and send us Malachi far in
[16:01] the lives of the prophet and prophesy
[16:04] all them times and say it over and over
[16:07] again even in tongues and interpretation
[16:09] has john the baptist was sent to forerun
[16:13] the first coming of christ you're sent
[16:15] with the message support run the Second
[16:17] Coming he can't say that and then forget
[16:20] it all he cannot say I'll turn the
[16:24] hearts of the children back to the faith
[16:26] of the fathers and then abandoned the
[16:28] project he can't do it
[16:31] he can't do it it's it's impossible for
[16:34] God to lie nobody you know this life
[16:38] that we have is a quickening life a man
[16:41] just like the natural life that you must
[16:43] be born into this life John three and
[16:47] five jesus said verily verily I say unto
[16:49] thee except a man be born of water and
[16:52] of the spirit he cannot enter the
[16:54] kingdom of God that which is born of
[16:57] flesh is flesh but that which is born of
[17:00] spirit is spirit so Jesus came to birth
[17:04] us into a new life a man and those that
[17:07] would be bold of him would be born of a
[17:10] new race a man there would be a new
[17:13] species unlike anything else a man that
[17:16] has ever been seen since the first
[17:18] creation they there would be a spirit
[17:21] men and women that's what I'm preaching
[17:24] here to a man I'm preaching the spirit
[17:27] born men and women born of the Holy
[17:31] Ghost empowered by the Holy Ghost sons
[17:35] of God daughters of God men and women
[17:39] who have been called to a purpose and a
[17:42] place in this day an hour the madam
[17:46] would tell us in spoken word
[17:48] his original seed he's said to be born
[17:50] of the word in the spirit it brings us
[17:53] back to the spoken word hallelujah did
[17:56] you ever think about it we think
[17:58] sometimes Hattie Wright had something
[18:00] special that happened for her and her
[18:01] children and indeed it was very special
[18:03] but every one of you they're born of the
[18:06] Holy Ghost is born just like that of the
[18:08] spoken word a man the word birds who the
[18:14] Bible said being born again not of
[18:16] corruptible seed but of the Word of God
[18:18] that liveth and abideth forever you're
[18:21] born of the word a word birth birth in
[18:26] word sons so he says to be born of the
[18:29] water in the spirit what does it do then
[18:33] it brings you right back again into the
[18:36] place where you should have been at the
[18:39] beginning
[18:40] see and that's the reason of Christ's
[18:42] death it brings us right back again to
[18:45] where sons of God so here in our second
[18:49] birth were born the way we should have
[18:51] been originally a man now as we look
[18:56] upon this greater life giver he first
[19:00] had to deal with the death that was upon
[19:03] mankind and and to do this God would
[19:08] actually become human he would become
[19:12] one of us
[19:13] you know Hebrews 2:14 says for as much
[19:17] as the children are partakers of flesh
[19:19] and blood he himself likewise took part
[19:23] of the same then through that through
[19:26] death he might destroy him that had the
[19:29] power of death that is the devil is that
[19:33] right amen so he here again he would
[19:36] come and take on flesh and blood hey man
[19:40] he would come as a man to suffer as a
[19:44] man to go through what we go through so
[19:47] he could become the proper mediator that
[19:52] you can be sure he was not your son
[19:54] distant out-of-touch God that was a
[19:57] spirit that never understood humanity
[20:00] but this God wanted you to know hey man
[20:05] he wanted you to know he cared enough
[20:08] for you he would leave all of glory to
[20:11] become one of you to become a human just
[20:15] like you are to go through what you go
[20:17] through to suffer problems just like you
[20:20] suffer amen so when you go to him that
[20:25] you're not going to a distant god that's
[20:27] out of touch that has never known what
[20:31] you go through but this God wanted you
[20:33] to know that he feels her pain he feels
[20:38] her sorrow a man that he's experienced
[20:42] it all himself are you with me now hey
[20:46] man Romans 8 in 20 when he tells us you
[20:49] know it makes it clear that man was not
[20:51] originally to
[20:53] nothing would die before Adam for the
[20:56] creature was made subject to vanity not
[21:00] willingly but by the reason of him who
[21:02] subjected the same is hope so again let
[21:05] me just translate this for against its
[21:07] will the universe itself has had to
[21:11] endure the empty futility and chaos
[21:14] resulting from the consequences of human
[21:17] sin so you see human sin that subjected
[21:22] all of the universe and all of mankind
[21:28] into a suffering condition hey man and
[21:33] since you were made subject to death he
[21:36] came down from heaven to be one of us in
[21:41] order to elevate us back to sonship
[21:44] again hallelujah Amen hebrews chapter 2
[21:49] verse 15 and to deliver them who was in
[21:51] the fear of death were all their
[21:53] lifetime subject to bondage hallelujah
[21:58] he comes to deliver those who are in the
[22:02] fear of death amen for verily he took
[22:05] not on him the nature of angels but he
[22:08] took on him this seed of Abraham wherein
[22:12] all things have believed him to be made
[22:14] like unto his brethren Amen that he
[22:18] might be a merciful and faithful high
[22:20] priest in things pertaining to God to
[22:23] make reconciliation for the sins of the
[22:27] people for in that he himself had
[22:29] suffered being tempted he is able to
[22:32] secure them that are tempted let me just
[22:37] say let me just say that again
[22:38] paraphrase it this way for him that he
[22:40] suffered himself has said he himself has
[22:43] suffered being tempted he is able to aid
[22:46] those in art in t
[22:49] hey man and brother branham would tell
[22:52] us in the preaching of the Hebrews he
[22:54] said he said God could not suffer in the
[22:57] spirit so he had to become flesh to feel
[23:02] the pain I'm talking about our report
[23:05] tonight
[23:06] I'm talking about believing I report I'm
[23:10] drunk I believe in what Jesus did I'm
[23:13] talking about him becoming a human to
[23:15] pay the price of redemption and become
[23:18] the Lamb of God and become your
[23:20] sacrifice and bear your sickness and
[23:23] bear your sins but God didn't suffer in
[23:32] the spirit he had to become flesh to
[23:35] feel the pain of sickness to feel the
[23:38] temptation of lust to feel the
[23:40] temptation of want to feel the
[23:42] temptation of hunger to feel the power
[23:45] of death that he might take it upon his
[23:47] self to stand in the presence of the
[23:50] Great Spirit Jehovah to make
[23:52] intercession to this life and Jesus took
[23:55] that in order to make intercession for
[23:58] us and he knows how it feels and when
[24:02] you get sick he knows how how you feel
[24:06] when you are tempted he knows how you
[24:10] feel hey man he's been through it a man
[24:15] he he knows exactly what you have been
[24:19] through and what you're going through a
[24:22] man he knows the temptation he knows he
[24:26] knows to battle when Satan comes and
[24:29] whispers in your ear
[24:32] come on that comes along and says God
[24:36] has forgotten that's a word it's not
[24:40] going to happen for others but it's not
[24:42] for you that you're left alone and
[24:47] abandoned in the situation I want you to
[24:50] know God God knows he came to experience
[24:54] it for himself brother Branham would say
[24:57] and how could I overcome temptation was
[24:59] for him you know that the Bible said he
[25:01] was tempted in all points like we are
[25:04] yet without sin he was tempted by
[25:07] drinking he was tempted by women he was
[25:09] tempted by everything that could be
[25:11] tempted by he was tempted by everything
[25:14] that we are he was a man and yet you
[25:16] couldn't put a mark on him a man now his
[25:21] redeeming work would be typed out in the
[25:25] Old Testament
[25:26] no Testament he would be shown he would
[25:29] show they can give the example of the
[25:31] high priest as Jesus would become the
[25:35] high priest and his redeeming work would
[25:38] also be typed out in the sacrifices
[25:41] because he would not only be the high
[25:43] priest but he would be the sacrifice a
[25:47] man so every Bullock would represent him
[25:51] the turtle does every lamb ever goat and
[25:57] you know all of that words was sacrifice
[25:59] would represent him in his sacrifice a
[26:04] man now in the Old Testament Aaron the
[26:09] high priest was instructed to take two
[26:11] go kids for a sin offering and he would
[26:15] cast lots and choose one to be offered
[26:17] as a sin offering in this and then then
[26:21] the other would be the scapegoat which
[26:24] Gordon at dictionary is a person who is
[26:26] blamed for someone else's wrongdoing and
[26:31] this is what happened in the Old
[26:33] Testament type to make her become a
[26:36] scapegoat Jesus would be blamed for your
[26:40] sins
[26:42] he would be punished for your sins and
[26:46] because of your sins also for your
[26:49] sickness because it's a dual atonement
[26:54] come on when sin came in sickness came
[26:57] in and so Jesus would actually actually
[27:01] become the one blamed take on if the
[27:06] sinless one who had done no sin would
[27:09] become blamed and the blame put on him
[27:11] and him go to death in your place now
[27:16] I'm preaching about I report a map now
[27:22] this happened in the Old Testament type
[27:24] would you like to read it with me in
[27:26] Leviticus 16 verse 21 and Aaron shall
[27:29] lay both his hands upon the head of the
[27:33] live goat and confess over him all the
[27:37] iniquities of the children of Israel and
[27:41] all their transgressions and all their
[27:43] sins and putting them upon the head of
[27:45] the goat and shall send him away by the
[27:48] hand of a fit man into the wilderness
[27:51] and the goat shall bear upon him all
[27:55] their iniquities until a land not
[27:59] inhabited and he shall let go the goat
[28:03] in the wilderness I want you to watch
[28:07] this here because God was actually
[28:09] showing us something as as two goats was
[28:13] taken and Lots was cast one would become
[28:16] of sin offering and be slaughtered and
[28:18] the other they would put the sins and
[28:20] the people upon him and take him out in
[28:23] the wilderness now brother branham would
[28:25] tell us that both of the goats
[28:28] represented Christ theologians sometimes
[28:31] will tell you that one I'm not
[28:33] representing Christ and the scapegoat
[28:35] represented the devil but if so then
[28:38] then the devil is representing us in
[28:40] Redemption and Satan don't have a part
[28:44] in Redemption
[28:46] are you with me a man and some but this
[28:50] is what happened to Jesus he was the one
[28:53] that God laid upon the iniquity of us
[28:58] all
[29:00] hey man Isaiah 53 and 3 he is despised
[29:06] and rejected of men a man of sorrows
[29:10] acquainted with grief we hid as it were
[29:13] our faces from him he was despised and
[29:17] we esteemed him not
[29:18] surely he had borne our griefs and
[29:21] carried our sorrows and we did esteem
[29:25] him stricken smitten of God and
[29:28] afflicted but he was wounded for our
[29:32] transgressions he was bruised for our
[29:35] iniquities and the chastisement of our
[29:39] peace was upon him and with His stripes
[29:42] we are healed
[29:51] hallelujah and Jesus remember John
[29:56] whether identify man said behold the
[29:59] lamb of God because now the lamb of God
[30:03] had taken on human flesh the sacrifice
[30:08] had become a human God had become a man
[30:13] hallelujah and Jesus would be wounded
[30:17] and torn and beat and punished and
[30:21] bruised and slapped a man I want you
[30:29] just a moment to picture this little
[30:31] goat kid he's innocent
[30:34] he's never done any wrong he's never
[30:37] done any sin he's just a little animal
[30:41] and and here he's taken and the lot is
[30:45] cast upon him and he's escaped though
[30:48] and they lay all of the sins of the
[30:53] people on this go to and they lead him
[30:59] out into the wilderness by a fifth man
[31:02] so he's gonna go way out into the
[31:04] wilderness very strong athletic fit man
[31:08] who's gonna take him out lead him out
[31:10] into the wilderness
[31:12] the man would have to hide his face from
[31:15] the little goat so he would be left
[31:19] alone and abandoned are you with me now
[31:24] because this would would be the very
[31:27] thing that would happen to Jesus your
[31:29] sacrifice where he would crowd my God my
[31:34] God why hast thou forsaken me
[31:38] now you remember you know a goat is a
[31:41] domesticated animal I used to raise him
[31:44] I had champion goats I raised some very
[31:46] many years I I know all about their care
[31:50] I know I know how they how they are I
[31:52] know their nature I know the way that
[31:54] they do they're not they're not a wicked
[31:56] animal there were a clean animal that
[31:59] representative sacrifice
[32:02] and there that will follow you as a as a
[32:05] as a man that will follow you out into
[32:08] pastures and they're very afraid to be
[32:11] left alone I've taken mine and walks out
[32:15] in the woods because of bread they're
[32:17] there they were browser's not grazers
[32:19] and so taking them out into the woods
[32:22] were there like a deer that liked to
[32:24] forage and eat well I reach up high for
[32:26] their food and so you know I I would
[32:30] walk out there with them and and and
[32:33] they were always looking to see where I
[32:35] was and I couldn't leave them out there
[32:38] because if I if I tried to leave them
[32:41] right back to the barn they'd go just as
[32:44] fast as I could go and and so you know I
[32:48] you know I I I know I know how they were
[32:52] but this number you I know the terror
[32:55] that they would feel when they would be
[32:58] left alone and you know I just want them
[33:03] you'd imagine the terror of this little
[33:06] goat scared fearful running to the
[33:11] thorns cut pierced then pounced upon and
[33:17] Entering torn and ripped apart as he's
[33:23] making an atonement for the sins he
[33:25] didn't even do the sins of man not his
[33:31] own sins I mean this was Jesus and men
[33:37] wounded torn beat punished whipped
[33:42] bruised slapped crowned with thorns and
[33:46] he took this in his flesh for your
[33:49] healing for your healer hallelujah
[33:58] think about it he would be forsaken so
[34:02] you would be forsaken he would be
[34:06] abandoned and sit the hell in your place
[34:10] into the wilderness in your place I'm
[34:16] talking about our Redeemer now a man
[34:19] brother Branham would say of it said
[34:22] even that just simile
[34:23] he said he'd add more death at
[34:25] Gethsemane you know then then that he
[34:28] did even on the cross he said when the
[34:30] eternal destination I've ever sold that
[34:33] ever was ever would be on earth rested
[34:35] on his decision hey ma'am the book of
[34:41] Hebrews he says during the days Christ
[34:44] days on earth he pleaded with God
[34:46] praying with a passion and with tearful
[34:49] agony that God would spare him from
[34:51] death hey man oh yes but in that great
[34:58] crucial out until he suffered knowing
[35:02] all things until such suffering - his
[35:05] water and blood separated in his body
[35:08] and great drops of sweat like blood
[35:12] dropped from his brow you know and there
[35:15] he he would die more death at Gethsemane
[35:20] then he would on the cross and what was
[35:24] he doing he was becoming the scapegoat
[35:29] descend this one happen to say I think
[35:32] the object I'm never committed adultery
[35:35] I've never done anything wrong I'm not
[35:38] you know I'm the sinless perfect one
[35:41] that has never never yielded in
[35:44] temptation but I've got to take all of
[35:47] the sins of the whole world
[35:51] upon myself ever adultery every filthy
[35:56] thing ever every evil spirit everything
[35:59] that you can imagine he will have to
[36:01] take the whole gamut of sin upon himself
[36:07] [Applause]
[36:09] ma'am what was he doing becoming the
[36:12] scapegoat where my sins and your sins
[36:16] were laid upon him the sinless one what
[36:20] father what was his body being big for
[36:23] why why were strikes being laid on him
[36:27] think about this strikes being laid on
[36:32] him he had never sinned he had never
[36:35] done anything wrong but he was doing
[36:38] this for you where God would lay on him
[36:42] the iniquity of us all where your sins
[36:48] would be transferred to him so his
[36:52] righteousness could be transferred back
[36:54] to you hallelujah
[37:01] hey man why was this why would stripes
[37:05] be laid on him Matthew 8:16 tells us
[37:09] when evening was come that brought him
[37:12] unto Him many that were possessed with
[37:15] devils and he cast out the spirits with
[37:18] his word and he healed all that were
[37:21] sick hallelujah and man that it might be
[37:28] fulfilled that which was spoken by
[37:30] Isaiah the prophet saying he himself
[37:32] took our infirmities and bare our
[37:36] sickness so you see here again this is
[37:40] what he would do he he healed he
[37:43] delivered to fulfill the scripture and
[37:48] he's still fulfilling that tonight
[37:51] and then because he hadn't gone and
[37:54] abandoned his project he knows your
[37:57] knees
[37:58] he knows how sick you are he knows how
[38:01] sinful you are he knows your condition
[38:04] and God cares about it I want you to
[38:13] know tonight
[38:14] you've got God's intention his eyes are
[38:20] upon you tonight he cares about your
[38:23] situation and how you're feeling this
[38:34] Cape coat torn by the Beast

[39:06] this little thing there and eating
[39:08] feeling this little belly and you know

[39:13] stuff and territory and all of a sudden
[39:17] the man slips behind the tree he then he
[39:22] finds a wagon slips out gets away from
[39:26] the little goat and a little goat now is
[39:29] by yourself alone behind every bush he's
[39:36] a he's an enemy something to tear him
[39:40] apart
[39:41] and he's screaming he's screaming very
[39:44] Shepard and he's yelling he's waiting
[39:48] where are you where are you you've left
[39:51] me I'm here alone I'm by myself
[39:56] and I'm defenseless against all of this
[40:00] my the enemy sentries here and before
[40:04] you know it you know it's calling every
[40:07] kind of thing every kind of predator is
[40:11] coming there from free you know ii think
[40:13] that's hearing these blades and here
[40:15] they're coming and and now it's been
[40:18] attacked and he's been pulled this way
[40:20] this has his high being torn and has
[40:23] through being ripped and his belly being
[40:26] opening and he dies an awful awful death
[40:30] torn by beasts and i want you to get a
[40:35] picture of your lamb you say lamb you
[40:41] said it was a goat listen he said take a
[40:43] lamb from the sheep or the goats that's
[40:47] right
[40:48] this little this little goat kid also
[40:52] called a lamb in the book of Exodus he
[40:56] would be torn apart and I want you to
[40:59] think about your lamb ever cancer
[41:03] diabetes TB asthma heart disease high
[41:10] blood pressure ever affliction crippled
[41:14] affliction blind deaf dumb lines disease
[41:19] ever beast of every kind writing at him
[41:24] tear in his flesh would ever whip out
[41:29] the cord would ever crown another torn
[41:34] are you with me Amen whatever slap that
[41:38] he didn't deserve but he was paying for
[41:45] your healing
[41:48] [Applause]
[41:50] he was paying for your salvation
[41:55] somebody women tonight the Bible said in
[42:01] first Peter 2:24 who his own self bare
[42:04] our sins in his own body on the tree
[42:09] that we being dead to sins should live
[42:12] unto righteousness by whose stripes we
[42:15] are healed
[42:17] [Applause]
[42:20] Colossians 1:21 says in you you you you
[42:25] you you who were sometimes alienated and
[42:31] enemies in your mind by wicked works yet
[42:35] now have he reconciled in the body of
[42:39] his flesh through death to present you
[42:43] holy and unblameable and Unruh provable
[42:46] in his sight so his body was an offering
[42:51] for our sickness but his soul now would
[42:57] go to hell in our place because his soul
[43:02] listen I live it intent
[43:05] it proves pleased the Lord to bruise him
[43:07] yet he put him he had put him to grief
[43:10] when thou shalt make his soul an
[43:12] offering for sin so his body now listen
[43:17] it's a dual atonement a man when sin
[43:21] came in sickness came with it is that
[43:24] right Amen so the atonement has to deal
[43:27] with both sin and sickness so he would
[43:31] actually bear your sickness in his body
[43:35] oh I feel the Holy Ghost right now he
[43:42] would bear your affliction are you with
[43:47] me now
[43:48] and his body was an offering for our
[43:51] sickness but his soul with the hell in
[43:56] our place hey man he's here
[44:00] verse 11 said he shall see the travail
[44:03] of his soul
[44:05] so when just the travail of his body but
[44:09] it would be also the travail of his soul
[44:11] a man a man and now so he said that he
[44:19] would bear their iniquities so there in
[44:22] heaven now what you do is get a picture
[44:24] because Jesus did not his body was in
[44:29] the tomb but he's very much alive and he
[44:34] went to hell in your place for your sins
[44:38] your sins he would carry them into the
[44:42] wilderness where no man dwells
[44:46] [Applause]
[44:51] hallelujah and he would carry them into
[44:54] hell your sins my sins he didn't deserve
[45:01] to go to hell but God would go to hell
[45:04] in your place by becoming flesh in Jesus
[45:09] Christ are you with me and in hell he
[45:14] would be punished
[45:17] haunted torn he would bear the brunt of
[45:22] scorns of demons he would he would have
[45:28] to endure the bragging of death that
[45:32] says I got you you're in my clutches and
[45:39] he would go with the torment of every
[45:42] demon tormentor known to man we got you
[45:47] I knew a chair in his soul
[45:54] I'm an can you can you imagine no you
[45:58] can't imagine it of me you know this is
[46:01] worsening the most nightmare at
[46:03] Halloween you can't even fathom what it
[46:08] was to face every kind of demon power
[46:12] ever spirit of the Last Temptation every
[46:15] kind of devil you honking at him and
[46:18] palm tearing at him and ripping at him
[46:24] are you with me a man he had to bear the
[46:28] brunt the scorn the torment of ever
[46:31] demon tormentor known to man that would
[46:36] carry the soul the Bible said in 2nd 2nd
[46:40] Corinthians 5:21 for he had made him to
[46:43] be sin for us he would go to hell a
[46:49] Senate yet he never sinned but he was
[47:03] carrying your sins
[47:04] just like the scapegoat never sinned it
[47:08] had no sin but now it's bearing the sins
[47:13] of the nation and here he is bearing the
[47:17] sins of the world brother Branham will
[47:23] describe hell and the haunting spirits
[47:26] that are there and the awful feelings
[47:30] and he would go through all of it
[47:36] touken laugh now remember I want you to
[47:46] get this tonight his body would suffer
[47:51] for your body his soul would suffer for
[47:55] your soul it's a dual atonement
[48:01] hey man you can't preach the atonement
[48:06] without preaching to find healing if God
[48:11] saves he healed if he's still saving
[48:15] he's still healing you say I'm saved
[48:23] tonight
[48:24] he's still the same healer his blood
[48:27] still atone but on that third day are
[48:46] you with me I mean I I don't know I know
[48:49] that that that he he had spent that time
[48:53] in Hell being haunted pulled out
[48:56] tormented everything else you his soul
[48:59] for your soul are you with me but on
[49:03] that third day once his soul had been
[49:07] offered it did sense to the lower
[49:11] regions of hell
[49:14] hallelujah and there is he comes into
[49:17] the lowest regions of Hell when Satan
[49:22] looks at him and said AHA I got you and
[49:25] here you are
[49:27] yeah I thought I had you with it with
[49:29] Abel because I knew there would be a
[49:32] seed and I thought I had you with Moses
[49:35] who were like when I fitted him to sin
[49:37] and I thought I had to here but here you
[49:39] come I catch you now Alleluia but dari
[49:47] in that moment of time there was a
[49:50] transformation that started happening
[49:54] hallelujah else Terry is another
[49:56] scripture that begins to kick in
[50:01] because it's all would be offered very
[50:03] far for sin but that was in all the
[50:07] scripture a man because the scripture
[50:10] begins to change from being the
[50:13] sacrifice to the conquer hallelujah and
[50:18] the scriptures of the mighty conquer
[50:21] began to take hold of him because the
[50:25] scripture had also said ah that will not
[50:28] leave my soul in hell and neither will I
[50:32] allow my Holy One to see corruption
[50:35] [Applause]
[50:37] hallelujah sums 14 and 15 but God will
[50:41] redeem my soul from the power of the
[50:43] green for he shall receive me Oh
[50:48] hallelujah Oh glory to God and there in
[50:53] that moment friends he changes from from
[50:56] from being the one beaten and torn and
[51:01] wounded to be in the conquer sin is been
[51:11] painful he doesn't have to pay for
[51:14] eternity
[51:15] he doesn't once and for all
[51:18] and he gets saved of Satan I came here
[51:21] as a sinner but I'm not a sinner anymore
[51:24] I am a conquer and I'm taking your keys
[51:28] of death and appel away from you
[51:30] [Applause]
[51:35] [Music]
[51:45] what's my victory God a man in the
[51:56] string of death is sin and the lonely
[51:59] gate strength of sin but Jesus is act
[52:02] betrayed over sand over sickness over
[52:06] the grave over disease over death itself
[52:14] and Jesus took our sins that for taking
[52:18] the sting out of death hallelujah if you
[52:26] just realize it here tonight death can
[52:28] only the only power that death has is to
[52:31] take you in the presence of God he can't
[52:33] take you to hell
[52:36] he can't take you to punishment somebody
[52:40] help me preach hey man the Bible would
[52:44] tell you that he took the keys from

[1:05:25] roar I didn't even sound like a good
[1:05:32] lion my grandchildren would have loved
[1:05:36] it though you know he sees a lion in the
[1:05:44] path and now he's afraid how will I ever
[1:05:49] get to my gold how will I ever reach the
[1:05:52] celestial City and of course you know
[1:05:58] there was some of his friends left him
[1:06:01] at that time and you know they ran
[1:06:04] patients were and given others run and
[1:06:07] you know they're they're overcome by
[1:06:09] fear but he says I've got to reach the

[1:06:15] if a lion eats me I'm gonna if I have
[1:06:18] that I'm gonna die trying
[1:06:22] and so he sees the lineup up ahead and
[1:06:26] here's the roar and he ceased he's going
[1:06:29] along taking one step at a time looking
[1:06:32] at this line watching him wondering when
[1:06:37] he's gonna come running toward him he
[1:06:40] noticed the line stays in the same place
[1:06:42] is roaring he gets up closer and closer
[1:06:47] his heart's pounding and he looks over
[1:06:50] there as he gets up close and the line
[1:06:53] is chained
[1:06:58] and not only that but he's been declawed
[1:07:01] and defamed I'm trying to tell you your

[1:08:09] [Music]
[1:08:11] man now let me just make it clear Satan
[1:08:16] does not have the power of death the
[1:08:19] Bible said in Hebrews 12 to 14 for he
[1:08:22] has said for as much then as the
[1:08:25] children are partakers of flesh and
[1:08:27] blood he himself likewise took part of
[1:08:31] the same that through death he might
[1:08:34] destroy him that had the power of death
[1:08:36] that is the devil hey man if you're not
[1:08:43] I'm the first from the last I'm he that

[1:09:08] other day when Satan's seen a chance to
[1:09:11] kill me but he couldn't do it he
[1:09:19] couldn't do it and death ain't gonna
[1:10:04] ride you to heaven you're gonna ride dad
[1:10:06] to heaven cause death is only an
[1:10:11] obedient slave to bring you out of this
[1:10:14] dimension into another dimension brother

[1:13:13] cancer he defeated heart trouble he
[1:13:17] defeated ever known or unknown malady
[1:13:20] demand hallelujah

[1:14:36] his name doesn't change his power he
[1:14:39] still defeated a man that at the name of
[1:14:43] Jesus every knee has to bow
[1:14:46] come on Philippians 2:9 wherefore God
[1:14:50] highly exalted him and given him a name
[1:14:53] which is above every name that at the
[1:14:58] name of Jesus every knee should bow of
[1:15:03] things in heaven of things in earth and
[1:15:06] things under the earth and every tongue
[1:15:08] should confess that Jesus is Lord
[1:15:12] and it declares right here in the Word
[1:15:16] of God his name is higher than cancer
[1:15:18] his name is higher than sickness his
[1:15:22] name is higher than in his sin his name

[1:16:43] never forget you because your names are
[1:16:47] engraved in the palms hallelujah he
[1:16:58] didn't raise an almost dead man he
[1:17:01] didn't raise a crippled man he didn't

[1:17:33] [Music]
[1:17:37] and blessed be the name of the Lord he
[1:17:41] gave you and me the right to use his
[1:17:43] name because we're born in the same
[1:17:46] family a son of God ever says devil you
[1:17:53] go cancer you go sickness you go
[1:17:57] it has to obey you because you've been
[1:18:02] given the authority to use that name and
[1:18:11] on the day of Pentecost he sent back his
[1:18:14] spirit to dwell in us so we could share
[1:18:17] in his life that because he lives we
[1:18:22] shall live we shall live also a man come
[1:18:26] on a man because that he raised up
[1:18:29] sinless even you by being dead to sin
[1:18:33] and matter then pair it with human
[1:18:36] baptism you too can rise in the newness
[1:18:39] of life Alleluia
[1:18:42] a man with abundant life and you that
[1:18:46] are sick can be healed and immediately
[1:18:53] after having parted his life immediately
[1:18:57] after the Holy Ghost came immediately
[1:19:00] they begin to impart healing to the man
[1:19:04] at the gate called beautiful and Satan
[1:19:07] and sickness were cast out is that right
[1:19:12] this is a commission Matthew 10 and
[1:19:15] verse 8 heal the sick cleanse the lepers
[1:19:17] raise the dead cast out devils as freely
[1:19:23] as you received freely give it
[1:19:28] hallelujah amen you you receive healing
[1:19:32] freely come on weird to offer healing
[1:19:35] and may we receive salvation freely
[1:19:38] didn't we we are to offer salvation
[1:19:43] you see divine healing is the earnest of
[1:19:46] the resurrection somebody with me now
[1:19:49] hey man that's what divine healing is is
[1:19:52] the earnest of the resurrection just
[1:19:54] just as the Holy Ghost is a downpayment
[1:19:57] on the endless life you see the the same
[1:20:01] is true that you know we do not have yet
[1:20:04] immortal bodies we still are here in
[1:20:06] Portland mortal bodies our soul has been
[1:20:11] redeemed and we got a deposit called the
[1:20:14] Holy Ghost is that right it's called the
[1:20:18] earnest or the downpayment as brother
[1:20:21] Branham would say off and you know if we
[1:20:24] have this kind of joy here just happen
[1:20:27] to deposit what are we gonna have will
[1:20:30] we get the fullness come on and right
[1:20:35] now we've got a deposit come on the
[1:20:38] earnest of our resurrection and is
[1:20:41] called divine healing and it's a down
[1:20:46] payment that there are going to be
[1:20:48] people on earth a man who will be
[1:20:51] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:20:53] eye and be healed from the top of their
[1:20:56] head to the sole of their feet it is a
[1:20:59] down payment on your new body hallelujah
[1:21:06] [Music]
[1:21:09] hey man he would tell us over and over
[1:21:13] if there's no divine healing there's no
[1:21:16] resurrection of the dead brother branham
[1:21:19] would tell us over and again he says now
[1:21:21] he says if I can't get you to believe
[1:21:25] for divine healing of the body how am I
[1:21:29] gonna get you to believe and receive
[1:21:32] faith for a rapture don't miss her
[1:21:37] interpret that just because maybe you
[1:21:39] don't get the faith for a certain malady
[1:21:41] in your life or whatever that that your
[1:21:44] your soul isn't saved it has nothing to
[1:21:46] do with your soul but he's just simply
[1:21:48] saying that if the church can't even
[1:21:51] believe for divine healing
[1:21:53] then how are we gonna believe for the
[1:21:55] change of our body hey man
[1:22:00] person gives a heart trouble and God
[1:22:02] heals that part gives him a new heart
[1:22:06] he's 60 years old he don't get a 14 year
[1:22:10] old heart he gets a 60 year old heart
[1:22:13] just healed and well are you with me I
[1:22:17] mean this is what God does and this is
[1:22:21] what he offers he offers healing for the
[1:22:23] body salvation for the Soul
[1:22:26] is that right amen but if we can't but
[1:22:30] you know if we can't even believe that
[1:22:32] God is a healer of the body how are we
[1:22:36] gonna believe that people that you can't
[1:22:37] even find a spoon full of ashes but
[1:22:40] seven ages are going to be so so healed
[1:22:44] delivered set free until they're
[1:22:47] standing back on their feet again
[1:22:50] resurrected come on
[1:22:53] if we can't believe that God can heal
[1:22:56] just a little part of our body how can
[1:22:58] we believe that the dead in Christ are
[1:23:00] gonna rise and God has asked this age to
[1:23:05] believe something very very important
[1:23:09] you are to believe for the change of the
[1:23:12] body and the meeting in the air
[1:23:14] [Applause]
[1:23:16] [Music]
[1:23:20] hallelujah hallelujah the Holy Spirit
[1:23:27] you have is the earnest of our eternal
[1:23:31] life
[1:23:32] amen divine healing is the earnest of
[1:23:35] the resurrection that's the reason that
[1:23:39] God included divine healing how could
[1:23:41] you take it out of the gospel when he
[1:23:43] was wounded for our transgressions and
[1:23:45] with His stripes we were healed listen
[1:23:49] and let me quote to brother Branham the
[1:23:50] same blood from the same man on the same
[1:23:53] day one for healing wasn't one for
[1:23:56] salvation one for healing to deny one is
[1:23:59] to deny the other you see it was a dual
[1:24:02] atonement he said they turned it around
[1:24:05] today in the days of Jesus here on the
[1:24:08] earth in a physical body they said we
[1:24:11] know he can heal but he makes herself
[1:24:14] God by forgiving sins
[1:24:18] mm but today they say he's alright he
[1:24:21] can forgive sins but he can heal but he
[1:24:25] says praise be to God he can do both
[1:24:30] and he says I'm a witness and yura
[1:24:33] witness both salvation for the soul and
[1:24:36] salvation for the body do you know what
[1:24:43] lays in the very center of God's will
[1:24:46] you know the Bible is God's will is
[1:24:48] called a testament his will and
[1:24:53] testament right is his covenant do you
[1:24:57] know laying right in the very center of
[1:25:00] God's Word in the very center of God's
[1:25:05] Word is sums 103 that's a very center of
[1:25:11] the King James Bible sums 103 says who
[1:25:16] forgiveth all our iniquities and he
[1:25:19] lives all that diseases who redeemeth
[1:25:22] thy life from destruction layin right in
[1:25:27] the center of God's will the center of
[1:25:33] his will and testament right in the
[1:25:37] middle bridge in the way for the old and
[1:25:39] the new covenant come on now I'm the
[1:25:43] healer I forgive all in the grease and I
[1:25:46] heal our diseases and I redeemed by life
[1:25:49] with her sickness or whether sin from
[1:25:52] destruction God put her right in the
[1:25:57] center of your Bible to tell you that's
[1:26:01] the center of his will this is what he
[1:26:04] did for your behalf to heal your
[1:26:10] sickness and save you from your sins
[1:26:14] amen
[1:26:15] the Bible said in Matthew 8 and verse 17
[1:26:20] himself took our infirmities that's
[1:26:23] weaknesses and he bare our sicknesses
[1:26:26] that's diseases as believers we do not
[1:26:31] have to tolerate sin in our lives
[1:26:35] because Jesus bore our sins
[1:26:39] and neither do we need to tolerate
[1:26:41] sickness in our bodies because Jesus
[1:26:44] bore our sickness
[1:26:46] hallelujah Isaiah 53 and for surely he
[1:26:50] had borne that means carried away
[1:26:53] he carried away our griefs that word
[1:26:55] really is interpreted the true
[1:26:58] translation of it from the Hebrew he he
[1:27:01] had carried away our sicknesses and
[1:27:04] diseases and carried our sorrows which
[1:27:08] is pains he carried your pains he bore
[1:27:14] our griefs sicknesses and diseases first
[1:27:18] Peter 2:24 who his own self bare our
[1:27:22] sins in his own body on the tree now if
[1:27:29] he bore them you don't need to bear them
[1:27:35] I'm I'm giving a declaration tonight
[1:27:39] man that if he bore them you don't have
[1:27:42] to bear your sins not another day not
[1:27:48] another minute because he bore your sins
[1:27:54] are you with me a man now if we have to
[1:27:59] bear them Jesus didn't need the barrel
[1:28:01] and then it would be useless for Jesus
[1:28:05] to barrel and Jesus became sick with our
[1:28:11] diseases as God he couldn't do that but
[1:28:16] God became a man and took on the veil of
[1:28:19] flesh he knew no sickness until he
[1:28:23] become a man he knew no sin until he
[1:28:28] become a man and the object of Christ
[1:28:31] sin Baron was to make righteous all that
[1:28:33] believe in him to be their sin bearer
[1:28:35] and the object of his disease Baron is
[1:28:39] to is to make well all those who would
[1:28:42] believe in him as their disease Bearer
[1:28:44] and this healing is so abundant Jesus
[1:28:49] said
[1:28:49] the miracles that I do say you do also
[1:28:54] amen
[1:28:55] not only that but you as a redeemed at
[1:28:58] son and a righteous son can speak his
[1:29:01] word and ask anything in his name Satan
[1:29:08] cannot stand before that name now and
[1:29:10] any more than he can stand before the
[1:29:14] man who gave you the right to use it
[1:29:18] hey man hey man brother branham tells us
[1:29:22] in the pergamene church age this word he
[1:29:25] has left behind on printed page is a
[1:29:28] part of him when you accept it by faith
[1:29:30] into a spirit filled life
[1:29:33] he said his word was life a man and he
[1:29:37] says I am the way the truth and the life
[1:29:39] he said if any man not have not the
[1:29:41] Spirit of Christ he's none of his there
[1:29:47] it is he is spirit he is life that's
[1:29:51] exactly what the word is and that's
[1:29:53] exactly what Jesus is he is the word so
[1:29:56] when a spirit born spirit filled man in
[1:30:02] faith takes that word into his heart and
[1:30:05] places an upon his lips well that is the
[1:30:09] same as TV speaking every mountain has
[1:30:14] to go Satan cannot stand before that man
[1:30:19] I'm talking to a church tonight that
[1:30:22] Satan cannot stand before I'm talking to
[1:30:26] a people tonight Satan cannot stand
[1:30:29] before then a word has been given to you
[1:30:32] are you with me now hallelujah you may
[1:30:38] feel like a little weakling like David
[1:30:40] flat before Goliath were the puny little
[1:30:42] sling and little stones against a mighty
[1:30:45] giant but his faith went into action
[1:30:50] hallelujah and here's for his little
[1:30:52] puny arm became a whirlwind the power
[1:30:55] and God took ahold of that arm and that
[1:30:59] puny stone became
[1:31:00] a lethal weapon Alleluia a man when
[1:31:07] David looked what he saw was his God was
[1:31:10] bigger than any giant come on we may be
[1:31:16] thinking we're facing a giant that our
[1:31:18] God is bigger than any giant a man I
[1:31:24] have been preaching since in New Year's
[1:31:26] on Joshua 1:8 this book of the law shall
[1:31:29] not depart out of thy life thy mouth
[1:31:31] you've got to keep saying the word
[1:31:35] confessing what God said Amen but thou
[1:31:39] shalt meditated a day and night that
[1:31:42] that miss observed to do all that is
[1:31:45] written therein but then thou shalt make
[1:31:47] thy way prosperous and then thou shalt
[1:31:50] have good success have not I commanded
[1:31:53] thee be strong and of good courage be
[1:31:57] not afraid neither be thou dismayed for
[1:32:00] the Lord thy God is with thee
[1:32:04] whithersoever thou goest Alleluia I'm
[1:32:09] announcing tonight the death a disease
[1:32:12] is as powerless as it was then when the
[1:32:16] Son of man walked the earth
[1:32:18] demons fear the word today in the lips
[1:32:20] of a man who walks with God as when they
[1:32:23] bound to it in the in Jesus day all hell
[1:32:26] knows the power of Jesus name they know
[1:32:31] our legal rights in our authority so
[1:32:34] they're fighting to keep us in the
[1:32:35] ignorance of our legal rights or if we
[1:32:40] know them to keep us under condemnation
[1:32:42] so we won't use them amen but Matthew
[1:32:47] 18:18 said verily verily I say to you
[1:32:50] what thing soever you said bind on earth
[1:32:52] shall be bound in heaven and what thing
[1:32:56] soever you shall loose on earth shall be
[1:32:58] loosed in heaven
[1:32:59] and again I've seen here of any two of
[1:33:02] you shall agree on earth as touching
[1:33:04] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[1:33:07] done for them of my father who is in
[1:33:10] heaven for were too
[1:33:12] three are gathered together in my name
[1:33:14] there I am in the midst of them

[1:35:11] rise and live this truth you know takes
[1:35:15] a book eat the book and then speak the
[1:35:17] book God's hands are tied until he can
[1:35:23] use ours angels are servants they can't
[1:35:27] do our work man God's limited to our
[1:35:31] faith and our obedience to his word the
[1:35:34] only thing that will limit God is your
[1:35:36] faith otherwise he's unlimited come on
[1:35:41] God is big only word some man makes him
[1:35:45] big amen by using this divinely given

[1:35:59] let's be a mighty army army you know did
[1:36:02] it listen the Bible said he's the Lord
[1:36:05] of Hosts look at revelation 19 and see
[1:36:15] if it's just angels
[1:36:17] it ain't angels riding behind him and
[1:36:20] white horses it's the sons of God
[1:36:26] and it means the Lord of hosts and he's
[1:36:29] the Lord of armies he's got an army
[1:36:31] right here in this church tonight

[1:36:42] God he's got men of faith he's got
[1:36:44] people he's gonna use in this generation
[1:36:48] cuz he's a lord of armies brother
[1:36:54] Branham said in perfect faith I'll just
[1:36:56] see how advanced my churches on what we
[1:36:59] believe in just see how advanced the
[1:37:02] people are and how they're ready to take
[1:37:04] the sword and walk out in the front line
[1:37:06] and say I challenge you Satan
[1:37:08] see our Challenger you can't make me you
[1:37:12] can't make me disbelieve anymore what
[1:37:18] are these things done for us so that
[1:37:20] people will believe it's the word it
[1:37:23] shows that what I'm preaching to you is
[1:37:25] the truth the word and the Word made
[1:37:27] flesh made flesh and you made word made
[1:37:30] life in you made life in me so God gives
[1:37:33] you a sword now well brother Tim we're
[1:37:37] third Pope believers brother we believe
[1:37:39] in the opening of the word oh you know I
[1:37:42] do too but when it comes to a prophet of
[1:37:47] God it came as a sword a sword in the
[1:37:51] hand not a sword in the scabbard and
[1:37:55] brother Brandon said it you know I must
[1:37:58] be faithful to this third pull it's the
[1:38:01] message hey man it's the word that has
[1:38:06] been put in your hands it's not for
[1:38:09] decoration is somebody with me it's
[1:38:16] nothing it's not to make yourself
[1:38:17] important not for decoration to sit on
[1:38:21] your side and I'm in the Lord's army
[1:38:23] hearing the Lord's army get your sword
[1:38:26] out
[1:38:27] we got a devil to defeat hallelujah
[1:38:32] and as we defeat this Goliath there's a
[1:38:35] mini mower that we got to get out there
[1:38:37] and defeat a man everyone if you've got
[1:38:41] your own Galasso go out there and defeat
[1:38:45] he put a sword in your hand but a sword
[1:38:48] ain't any good as long as it's not
[1:38:51] welded by hand there's got to be held in
[1:38:53] the hand and the hand that this one is
[1:38:56] held in if you look at revelation 19
[1:38:59] that his sword is in his what mouth he
[1:39:05] holds his sword where he sent His Word
[1:39:08] and healed them by his word he cast out
[1:39:12] Devils the sword of the Lord the Word of
[1:39:16] God in your mouth will defeat the devil
[1:39:18] anywhere any place any time but it's got
[1:39:22] to be put in your mouth and must become
[1:39:25] your confession
[1:39:26] [Applause]
[1:39:31] because the moment he gets you to
[1:39:34] disbelieve your weapon you are defeated
[1:39:38] but if you believe in your weapon you
[1:39:41] will hold it and speak it with faith and
[1:39:45] with faith comes through the word it
[1:39:48] ignites the word it makes it work and it
[1:39:52] can't stop Devils it heals a sick it
[1:39:55] saves the last but it's dormant as long
[1:40:01] as it's in a scabbard it won't cut
[1:40:04] butter but once it taken in your puts on
[1:40:11] your lips it's the same as deity
[1:40:14] speaking takes a strong hand of faith to
[1:40:18] cut through everything that devil can
[1:40:20] put there and make every promise of God
[1:40:22] you know shine forth amen a strong hand
[1:40:27] of faith brother Branham had a lot to
[1:40:28] say about that
[1:40:29] you know Joshua knew his position I'm
[1:40:33] Wanda now it's okay you'll be all right
[1:40:36] you're not gonna pass out but generally
[1:40:40] he looked at the Sun and the moon
[1:40:42] commanded him to stand still that took
[1:40:45] courage whoever thought that with word
[1:40:50] now you can say how you want to how this
[1:40:52] does this understood still the earth
[1:40:54] quit removing whatever I don't really
[1:40:57] care the mechanics I just know the
[1:40:58] dynamics it doesn't matter you know you
[1:41:05] know what the physics was or whether the
[1:41:08] sudden stopped or whether the earth
[1:41:09] stopped well the Sun don't move their
[1:41:11] throws rotate you know all of the all
[1:41:14] the weird ideas that we come up with you
[1:41:16] know why this word don't work all I know
[1:41:18] is the light held till every enemy was
[1:41:23] defeated
[1:41:24] I can't explain it I just know what
[1:41:28] happened and there's a lot of this hakim
[1:41:32] explained but I just know it works
[1:41:36] [Applause]
[1:41:42] proverbs 4 20 says my son attend to my
[1:41:46] words and climb their ears from my
[1:41:47] sayings let them not depart from thine
[1:41:50] eyes and keep them in the midst of thine
[1:41:52] heart for they are life unto those that
[1:41:54] find him and help to all their flesh
[1:41:57] that word has never failed in the mouth
[1:41:59] so believe in Christians you see the
[1:42:03] word is alive and the word has to act so
[1:42:07] therefore you see he stood there on the
[1:42:09] promise of God he could look back over
[1:42:11] and he could see Moses said let there be
[1:42:13] darkness and it was darkness all over
[1:42:16] Egypt but let there be light in Goshen
[1:42:20] and he and he said as I was with Moses
[1:42:24] so will I be with you I need some more
[1:42:26] light Sun stands still
[1:42:29] are you with me hey man it's exactly
[1:42:33] right I mean you know they're there
[1:42:34] again the promise is there and brother
[1:42:36] Brown tells you you've got the power in
[1:42:38] you to do that now he said their God
[1:42:41] doesn't have little weak spots and big
[1:42:43] heavy spots as powerful the least little
[1:42:45] touch of God is omnipotent he said you
[1:42:49] got enough power in you right now to
[1:42:51] make a new world that's the power of the
[1:42:55] word that that is in you hey man we just
[1:42:59] need to target against the enemy it's
[1:43:01] more than just a system of religious
[1:43:03] beliefs where you understand doctrine
[1:43:06] ioan it becomes your new Creed not just
[1:43:09] a faith a firm belief so that you can
[1:43:11] embrace a new philosophy but if you know
[1:43:15] but a living faith this message was sent
[1:43:19] to vindicate the Bible not replace the
[1:43:22] Bible but to prove it right the seals
[1:43:26] were open to remove the mysteries off of
[1:43:29] his truth to reveal Christ to us to show
[1:43:32] his nature
[1:43:34] and his attitude what I don't understand
[1:43:36] is how come today so many people are
[1:43:39] claiming the book is open there's less
[1:43:40] power after it was opened in before it
[1:43:43] was open if the book is open the never
[1:43:47] promises open to us we got an abstract
[1:43:51] of the title deed that it belongs to us
[1:43:53] we set out more now that the seals are
[1:43:56] opened and before they wear open because
[1:44:00] now the whole ever promise in the book
[1:44:02] belongs to you this message to show you
[1:44:07] God's attitude toward the lost his
[1:44:09] attitude toward the sick a man that his
[1:44:12] mercy is so great a man coming right
[1:44:17] down now to something I want to come and
[1:44:19] bring this down to close as we come here
[1:44:23] now you know Jesus asked will I find
[1:44:30] faith on the earth he didn't say well I
[1:44:33] find nice churches will I find good
[1:44:38] people but will I find somebody that
[1:44:41] believes Malachi 4 was sent to turn your
[1:44:46] heart from unbelief back to faith again
[1:44:48] a man to cause a people to believe so
[1:44:54] that we can have a conscious faith to to
[1:44:58] to hold on to the promise let me just
[1:45:03] tell you a little you know a little
[1:45:05] experience that I have this year that
[1:45:07] where the Lord spoke to me you know some
[1:45:11] people have visions some people have
[1:45:13] dreams I have dreams sometimes that God
[1:45:15] has used but there's been many times it
[1:45:19] got a spoke to me an audible voice I
[1:45:21] hear his voice speak directly and you
[1:45:28] know I we got a we've got a brother in
[1:45:31] the church that Satan has done his best
[1:45:34] to kill and you know he's just not even
[1:45:40] missed threescore and ten you know but
[1:45:44] Satan's done his best to
[1:45:46] just before our annual October meetings
[1:45:50] two years ago the doctors had given him
[1:45:53] up to die called his family in said he
[1:45:56] just got ours to live get had a son in
[1:45:59] Montana to call home and get him home
[1:46:04] get everybody the family together the
[1:46:06] man's gonna die well it was before our
[1:46:09] october meetings be quite honest with
[1:46:12] you I didn't want a funeral in my
[1:46:14] October meetings I've started asking
[1:46:19] people in my church to make an
[1:46:20] appointment when they're gonna die but
[1:46:25] most the time it ain't convenient loosen
[1:46:34] you up for something so that was been
[1:46:38] doing this best to kill him
[1:46:40] you know and so he is he was they had
[1:46:45] told him he's gonna die call the family
[1:46:47] in he's that at very low hour and low
[1:46:50] time I wasn't I was in church that
[1:46:52] morning I spoke that Sunday morning on
[1:46:55] speaking to your mountain and it was

[1:51:03] it's spread to one-third of parts of his
[1:51:06] 1/3 of his bones the lymph nodes was in
[1:51:08] his stomach was so huge that his stomach
[1:51:10] swelled out visibly just way out doctors
[1:51:13] said they could burst to any minute
[1:51:15] said he had cancer and 50% of his body
[1:51:19] and just just um you know he he went
[1:51:25] through some some time with that and
[1:51:28] somewhere about August he went into and
[1:51:31] he had a doctor's visit and the doctor
[1:51:34] came in with the examination room and he
[1:51:38] came in smiling and he said let me just
[1:51:41] shake the hand of an awesome man Wow Wow
[1:51:44] Wow and he says your blood work shows
[1:51:48] you have no cancer
[1:51:55] [Music]
[1:51:56] what time to wrap his mind around this
[1:52:00] not understanding exactly what the
[1:52:03] doctor said he asked the doctor again
[1:52:05] about the cancer and the doctor said
[1:52:07] what cancer there is no cancerous gone
[1:52:10] and I can't explain where it went but
[1:52:12] your lymph nodes is normal and
[1:52:14] everything is normal your blood work is
[1:52:16] normal and you are cancer-free but you
[1:52:28] know don't give up sometimes so he
[1:52:30] strikes him back down with Oh Anna with
[1:52:34] a heart condition where he's having his
[1:52:36] arteries clogging and he's had so far 30
[1:52:39] stents in his heart that's a record six

[1:52:46] numerous heart attacks back in November
[1:52:52] of 2019 doctors gave up on him said we
[1:52:55] can't do anything more said your heart
[1:52:58] will explode any time and they could
[1:52:59] examine him they've said we will look to
[1:53:02] see if we can do open heart and see if
[1:53:03] we can do something that he said not
[1:53:05] your you're not a candidate for it we
[1:53:07] ruled it out it's too risky and you know
[1:53:11] God had healed him a cancer and he's a
[1:53:13] miracle but you know here this enemy
[1:53:16] still come in trying with heart heart
[1:53:19] trouble that's trying to kill him and
[1:53:22] the doctors you know had told him you
[1:53:25] know you got this cardiovascular disease
[1:53:28] that keeps clogging your arteries and
[1:53:29] you know it's got the place we can't do
[1:53:31] nothing more for you you you know you
[1:53:33] have another another spell you're gone
[1:53:36] you know just get ready to die so you
[1:53:40] know I hear this news because they were
[1:53:42] talking about open heart and all of this
[1:53:45] and you know and now I I was praying
[1:53:49] about it all through the night I'm
[1:53:50] talking to the Lord you know and I'm
[1:53:53] saying you know Lord Kenneth you
[1:53:57] understand what is what he's going
[1:53:59] through what what what to do about it
[1:54:02] you know and it was Wednesday November
[1:54:04] the 13th I woke her early
[1:54:08] and I was preparing my first cup of
[1:54:10] coffee and through the night as often as
[1:54:13] I woke I was praying for this brother
[1:54:16] and when he was doing a medically
[1:54:19] induced stress test the top of his heart
[1:54:22] quit working
[1:54:23] doctors had made that decision
[1:54:25] open-heart of death and they were
[1:54:27] discussing the option of that heart
[1:54:29] condition and we would rule out that
[1:54:32] they couldn't do anything and so I was
[1:54:35] got up then and I was praying for him
[1:54:37] and I and I told the Lord I said God
[1:54:42] Kenneth has had his showdown if he don't
[1:54:46] get a healing he will die and I said
[1:54:50] what are you gonna do about it
[1:54:52] I wouldn't being smart I was asking what
[1:54:55] are you gonna do about this and
[1:54:59] and so as soon as I got that out of the
[1:55:03] mouth the voice of god came roaring back
[1:55:05] to me and he says I've already done that
[1:55:08] part what are you gonna do about

[1:57:24] because of Adam's fall and we can't live
[1:57:27] forever and we were born in this world

[1:57:48] do about it he commissioned his church
[1:57:51] to cast out Devils and sickness is a
[1:57:54] demon man I can't heal and furthermore
[1:57:58] Jesus Christ cannot heal a man if he
[1:58:03] stood here with my clothes on tonight it
[1:58:05] stirred here in my shoes and man he
[1:58:07] could not heal anybody a man you see you
[1:58:11] would say Jesus will you heal me it's
[1:58:13] like I can't do it I'd have to go back
[1:58:14] on my word I said 2,000 years ago it's
[1:58:18] finished and it's still finished all you
[1:58:23] gotta do is receive

[1:58:35] down from heaven to heal every person to
[1:58:37] save Emma's sick one to save ever sinner

[1:58:45] all we are going to do is cast the devil
[1:58:47] out hey man so what I did is I I did
[1:58:53] what God said do I know anything with
[1:58:55] all and we prayed the prayer of faith I
[1:58:57] didn't call brothers up hoping that one
[1:58:59] of them had the faith to do this we have
