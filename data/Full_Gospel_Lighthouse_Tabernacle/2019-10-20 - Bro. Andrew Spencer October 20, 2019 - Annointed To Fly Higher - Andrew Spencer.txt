[Music] we're here tonight because he's broke some chains in her life we're a witness I certainly enjoyed that song by the way my sister Gabriella where were witnesses a man were witnesses of His grace and His mercy we're witnesses that we have come up higher a man I thought last night was absolutely awesome understanding the the burden of of just being in this pulpit and standing here I understand I understand what it's like to preach when you don't feel that you're 100% best and I thought last night was an absolute awesome challenge to us to live life with the king of life and with everything that's within us may we strive for life you know we're only mortal once so we might as well praise Him tonight we're only more to mourn so we might as well say amen to the word tonight we're only more than once so we might as well just lift up our hands to the God that deserves all the glory and all the honor worldly mortal once and while I got the chance I want to say Papa God I love you oh don't you love him tonight hey man I'd like to try to sing us a song tonight kind of go along with my message as the Lord's laid on my heart it's called it's called the set your wings to the winds of faith and I don't know if you heard it or not it kind of goes along with the thought tonight so I thought we might sing that set your wings to the winds of oh you can't fly in a higher plane oh do not struggle oh it's my great set your way so fight let's say that again Oh set your way to the winds of fate ah [Music] not struggle oh it's migraine set your wings winds of faith [Music]

got his arms completely surrounding you tonight maybe you got a little issue or maybe you got a little circumstance that you can't figure out but I I encourage you to set your wings to the winds of faith tonight hey man let's call them the God of heaven Lord what a privilege it is for us to bow our heads as your children before the dust of the earth from which we came Lord realizing that we're nothing Lord Jesus but 16 elements but in that 16 elements lays a soul that's worth 10,000 world's a soul that is longing for more of you a soul that is desiring to to just express what you mean to us tonight there's such a soul that desires for you to fill us up Lord like never before that makes us a value tonight that you had fleece that gene seat of God in us Lord Jesus to think that you thought of us before the world began and to think that we as mortals have the opportunity to serve an immortal God oh god I pray that we would do it with justice tonight the Lord I counted a privilege to stand behind this desk of Lord one more time to speak to you Bride of Christ Lord I'm not worthy and myself Lord these any of the righteous knives righteousness that I have is filthy rags the Lord I don't stand here upon my own merits nor do I stand here upon my own works I stand here upon the basis of your word and upon the shed blood father a stand here Lord as as a part of the bride of Jesus Christ that you said was spotless was blameless was pure and holy and Father Lord I pray that you would speak to your children tonight Lord through your word Lord I know that the things that these things that I've studied Lord been on my heart I pray God that you would just take the human element out of it tonight and may you speak from glory tonight I pray you would I pray that you would calm every person just now I pray that you'd call them every child just now and every evil spirit I pray you're driving out father I pray that as we would sit under the auspices of your holiness and set here father I pray that maybe just one word would touch our lives Lord that calls us to to rise above all the circumstances are all the things in our mind that would maybe weigh us down or hold us back but father may we lay aside every weight and sin tonight that does so easily beset us and let us run this race with patience let's lay aside those sins sin is to miss the mark and if we've missed the mark lord I pray that we would tune ourselves back up and get in line with your word we've heard an eagle that told us to get back in line father may we hit the mark tonight we glorify the God of heaven we sense your nearness and now and Lord and we just want to be very careful father that we would never offend you not just come by our way tonight we pray in Jesus name Amen man if you have your Bibles this even and what turned over in the Book of Revelations chapter 4 revelations chapter 4 and verse 1 tonight I'd like to speak to you kind of a an anthem it's been on my heart on on what has been taking place amongst the bride of Jesus Christ and just amongst us and I like to just title this little fall tonight on anoint it anoint it to fly higher I don't want it to fly higher after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne verse 7 we've already read enough here to shut down every turn it's arian tonight and one set on the throne verse 7 and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle may God bless his word he may be seated this evening man mm-hmm I ask for your complete attention this evening just as we would lay just a little bit of a foundation here this evening as we move into the the thought here that God's placed on our hearts we understand and know that we are living in one of the greatest hours that there ever has been upon the face of the earth to be living in we're living in an hour when when the prophet of God would would say that that if I could choose any other day to live in I would choose to live in this day we're living in an hour when everything is moving higher when we are seeing the the advancement of science and we watch those things from a vision of 1933 how that those things have trans fold it before us and we've seen those things literally become manifest in our eyes everything is moving higher you watch man and man he is always trying to outdo himself if he if a man sets a record he's going to try to break that record if if you watch a man he's constantly trying to build something that is higher there there in New York and over in Beijing in different places they are still trying to outdo one another and building skyscrapers and there it's a constant it's a constant moving of a to a higher level and I think that it is depicting of what we are doing as a body of Christ that that what we are seeing in the natural we are also seeing in the spiritual as well and brother branham would say about this age that it's a it's an age that is reaching for something but they can't find what they're looking for and hey you look everywhere you look in the hospitals and you look in the insane asylums or in the st. institutions and you find people that are there dissatisfied it's overrun with people that are dissatisfied and if you've ever been there you watch somebody in those nursing homes are in insane institutions that they're always kind of reaching out for something or trying and they're moaning trying to get back to something they're there reaching out for something you see there's something that is lacking in their life and they're trying to reach out for it you see that place what was placed on the inside of them for for a as a a throne room for God to set you see they had not satisfied that first with his calling but they they were sitting there in a dissatisfied spot and that's where America is at they're in a spot of dissatisfaction where where they're never happy where they're living at you watching you watch people that build their houses you watch somebody they'll build a house today and in five years they got to build a bigger house so or they get a car today and they get a get a new gotta get a new car you see it's because there is a pattern there's a matching time when everybody wants to be like everybody else who they want to move higher and truly that we do want to move higher as human being we don't want to be complacent in our in our walk do we we don't want to be complacent and where we are is where we live we don't even want to stay with the same pay rate that we got ten years ago we want to move higher in that I'd say every human being that's here tonight would agree that you would like a raise in your future but you see you're looking for something that is that is moving you higher and men are looking for jobs that will move them higher in a place of position but tonight I have the opportunity to speak to a people that has been placed in position before the foundation of the world is higher than any governor it's higher than any senator it's higher than any president it's higher than any Pope I am speaking to sons and daughters of God that have more power than any Archangel there is in heaven you have that much power you see and Satan longed Satan II when you look at it when you see Satan he longed to have that tower which you have he looked at it when he was there in heaven and he wanted to be like God and God had to kick him out he had to kick him out of heaven because he was trying to exalt himself and move higher than what God is and if we are not thinking try to move ourselves higher than what God is doing God will kick us out but you know how I realize that God is showing us something that God kicked Satan out of heaven in the beginning where sin was created where where sin was where where sin originated as it were it originated in heaven and God had to kick Satan out and every time you watch a Satan begins to raise himself higher in your life it is your duty as the army of God to kick Satan out as he tries to exalt himself in your life is that right I have a lift thee quote here I ask the brothers to put up with us this evening from the Laodicean Church age he says how strange in this age of plenty in this age of progress in this age of abundance how can there be trials well now it's it is strange but in this age of Plenty and opportunity when everyone is so much and there is so much more to be had what with all of these inventions to do our work and so many things that give us pleasure suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about millions are taking sedatives at night and pet pills in the morning rushing the doctors entering institutions are trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol yes this aids boast of of its tremendous stores of a worldly goods but the people are less happy than ever before this aids boast of its spiritual attainments but the people are less sure themselves than ever this aids boast of my better moral values and it is more corrupt than any age since the flood it talks about its knowledge in science but it is fighting a losing battle in all fields for the human mind and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or keep abreast with all the changes that have come upon the earth in one generation we have gone all the way from the horse and buggy age to the space age and we are proud and vote boastful about it but inside it is a dark lloyd cavern that is crying out in torment and without a known reason men's hearts are failing for fear and the world is so darkened that this age could well be called the age of neurotics it boasts but it cannot back it up it crosspiece but then there is no peace it cries that it has a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire there is no peace saith my god to the wicked as far as as we are as advanced as human beings you will find that you are more stressed than ever before you'll find that you are you have lost your joy like never before but not to us you'll find that you that you'll sign that you'll see that the farther we go it seems like the more that we are depleted of our energies but you see science has taken man forward and more forward greater things with his mind whether than what then the thing that only and that's the only thing he has is that tree of knowledge farther than minister has taken in with the spirit which is unlimited but here it is that science ain't looking back to what science said a few years ago science has taken what they got now and moving forward for something else you see you'll find that man is always moving forward science is always moving forward and to think that that brother Brandon would say that men like Einstein was breaking in to God's laboratory they were trying to progress higher than what God was now as we go back to our scripture reading we we notice here that these four anointings that we see them they're of the of a of the line and the ox and the man anointing and the ego anointing we understand that those anointings are of the same Holy Ghost that it's the Holy Ghost behind every one of them anointing in a different Avenue and we're taught that there in the in the book and in the New Testament where Matthew Mark Luke and John that they are the four guards to the the book of Acts to the move of God they're guarding the moving of the Holy Ghost and we see here that those four anointings that if you'll go back in the Bible you can see it over and ezq and Daniel in the Book of Revelations that you'll see that those four anointings that they're always looking forward those anointings are not looking backwards those anointings are looking to each other but those anointings are looking forward they're not looking backward to another day the eagle anointing is not looking back to the mandate and the mandate is not looking back to the Ox age and the arts age is not looking back to the lion age but every one of them is looking forward that's why we cannot move back to to the restoration of gifts and we cannot move - Wesley stay and loo Thursday what good would it us do us tonight if I stood here and I preached you that the just shall live by faith but there was no Holy Ghost that would come upon that what good would it have done for Wesley to come with the same message that Luther had already preached it would have not move him any higher in their progress of spiritual revelation it would just been speech preaching and speaking on the same level that they already were but God's Word was taking his children higher just like it would have done Moses no good to preach Noah's message of I'm gonna go out here and I'm gonna build an ark it would have done no good Moses could have built an ark but it would have done no good because I was coming no flood - Roz then I work out of its place it would have done no good to come of that type of message but Moses had become of his message David had become of his message I say I had to come with his message and in this day we cannot be standing here upon the experiences of our grandfathers and our great-grandfather's we've got to have our own fresh revival fresh tonight fresh tomorrow fresh the next day we gotta move on we can't go back Naruto every age has went higher in Revelation every ages went higher we came through man's day and you look at those men that that were standing in that day like Wesley and standing there like Charles Spurgeon it all of those men like Finney you had never seen such a moving such a moving of a revival like you had in that day men that were so deep in the word but yet they could not see like an eagle could see you see it was not the time for the eagle men that could stand there and preach thousands upon thousands of sermons and never grow old I'm preaching that word but they could not see that wrath they preach the rapture but they could not see the rapture you see you see there was a moving on from the mayonnaise to the Eagle aids but there is no more powers after that equal there's no more anointings after that eagle it is showing you that it is time for a rapture [Applause] hallelujah it's hey I'm going to go back to the mayonnaise I have to tell you that if you want to stay in the man age if you have no ego anointing you have no rapture we know that in revelations chapter four that John he symbolizes that the whole book of Revelation is a book of symbols and that john symbolizes the bride of all seven ages who receives that car to come up higher this symbolizes the rapture a rap stirring of the body the rapturing of the bride and there is a spiritual aspect to that call that has allowed us to see by the revelation of the hour that these things here they these things here are described but we know here by the preaching of the Prophet that we know that revelations chapter four is an eternal type of the bride physically raptured at the end of the seventh h is that right is that right but we have heard just like as it said John said come up hither and is showing you as a type of the bride moving out of this destination out of this realm into another realm but there is a spiritual aspect that is laying there in that scripture there is a screaming eagle that has screamed out and called out her name and said you can't stay down there in those denominations stay down in there and those Creed's we have heard these Eagle scream to come up higher I'm not satisfied staying down in the tricking yard I'm frye where eagles fly i was not knowing it for this hour hallelujah this Eagle scream has called us up higher pass the corn allottee a man and it's placed us in our position we know that that air in the in the seals that that when the rider would go forth and I know that there's some things that are said here but I want you to know it's not over your head tonight this was brought to you you can go to the library down here and you can find all types of books but there's no book like there like there is on the revelation of the seven seals as thus saith the Lord this is not above your head I hear some people say well I can't dive into those things because it's too deep it's not too deep for you it's for you right here is where Eagles gather if it's too deep too for you then why would he have a hillbilly Kentucky and preach you this message it's for you tonight I want you to say those words it's for me tonight but when we see that those were that the riders when a seal was broke that there would be a rider that would go forth and when that rider would go forth in that political power or that anointing that there would come an anointing or a power to go out in the first stage when there would have when there went out a white horse rider you'll notice that white that white horse rider was going out and he had he had a bull but he had no arrows through that boat and if you watch it's the same Antichrist spirit that travels its way all the way up and every time that errata went out there went forth and anointing out after it to come back to come back the power that was sent out by the Antichrist spirit Oh hallelujah that's why I can stand here tonight under this ego anointing under this age and protest to you and proclaim to you that there is a God there's a mighty angel that's standing right here tonight that's an eagle anointing here tonight that over that will come every spirit of hell that will combat every disease of hell this anointing will break every sin every bondage of sin this anointing is here it's not coming it's here hallelujah you see we understand these things because we're not looking through the eye of a man we're looking through the eye of an eagle hallelujah maybe I'll say it to you like this that faith is higher than now that faith takes you higher than words could ever move you can we agree tonight that healing is higher than diseases healing is higher than diseases but we will allow the stupid devil to try to choke us down with diseases upon diseases healing is higher than that move past that disease smite that devil that keeps holding you bail your healing is greater than that sickness your healing is greater than that disease your healing is greater than the tormentor can we say that faith is higher than fear that deliverance is higher than bondage and our joy is higher than sorrow and Revelation is higher than intellectualism you see if you're sitting in that condition of intellectualism like Paul was sitting in he said in the same spot of intellectualism is as a lot of people do in the message today they sit there and they proclaim their message relievers they can tell you about they they can tell you about the Angels they can tell you about the 42-inch caribou they can tell you about the meeting back there and Sabina they can tell you all those things but they have no life to back it up they're selling at an intellectual conception but I got good news for you brother branham made a statement in 1955 he said intellectual conception will never do but it will bring you to the Holy Ghost you ain't with far enough in your intellectual conception but move on just a little bit further move on past your thoughts you can't figure it out anyway [Applause] if you said in that intellectual condition I I had mana shoe to fly a little bit higher Paul had to fly a little bit higher and when he got knocked off of his high horse he stopped flying with buzzards and he started flying with Eagles he didn't want no pilot with Peter he didn't want no power James but when he met the pillar fire he was no longer identified with that bunch of buzzards that down there in Jerusalem and all of their high cities and all those things he was identified with a bunch of eagles it may have been a little bitty group but he was flying with Eagles and he was no longer flying with buses we're seeing through the eyes of a prophet and there is no higher order than a prophet in the land you know but there's something on the inside of you as a believer that leads you to a higher calling this message has led you and will take you higher it'll take you higher in your thinking higher in your speech higher in your dress higher in your life this message will take you higher in your praise hiring your worship higher in your attitude this message takes you to a new level of faith hello somebody it's a perfect faith it's not something that's snapped up that you can't get it's a common faith it's right there for you sometimes we think it's way up here when it's right here when it's right there on your level God has brought it down to your level so the littlest child could grab it tonight a little child tonight could stand here on this pulpit and tell you that cancers a liar and have the same authority as I've got little women that stand there at the window washing dishes doing the laundries got the same authority to call a devil devil and a disease a disease you're anointed to do so [Applause] hallelujah we're looking through the eyes of an eagle because the Bible tells us her name is 3 and 7 that surely the Lord thy God would do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets we're looking who are looking through the eyes of an eagle tonight turning me over to Deuteronomy 1 & 6 here we are breaking in after the 40th year that God was telling the children of Eire so it's time to move forward you'll notice that God every time he gives a call he is never pushing his children backwards but God is moving his children forward he says the Lord our God speaking to us in Horeb saying ye have dwelt long enough in this mount turn you and take your journey and go to the Mount of the Emirati and unto the place not there and to in the plane and the heels and in the valve and in the south and by the seaside to the land of the canaanites under the Lebanon and under the great river the GU River Euphrates behold he's trying to grab your attention behold I have set the land before you can I say it to you like this I set the message before you I said all your inheritance before you I've set you what you need to get off the ground I've set it out before you everything that I take out of your cold and dead cold formal religions I've set it out before you but what do you got to do children of Israel go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your father's Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them he's heading here 40 years to think that they were there 40 years and you could drive that you could drive whether they were going to in less than half a day but 40 years of complaining 40 years of murmuring calls him to circle this mountain but God finally came to them and said you're circled this melt ain't long enough turn northward don't look back don't look back to Egypt don't look back to the wilderness go forward can I say this to you don't go back to your Catholicism and your ideas of Pentecost don't go back to it fly higher people want to bring in they want to bring in charismatic worship why are we going back to the thing that we came out of people bringing in Pentecostal ideas that's just a watered-down gospel why are we going back to the Wallace come out of her my people I'm not going back I know what that produces it'll produce a life it will produce a life that is that is just a grasshopper but a grasshopper needs a full transformation Oh hallelujah if you want to fly with the Eagles you got to eat eagle food you got to praise like an eagle and Caleb and Joshua when they were come down to Kadesh Barnea when they come there to that spot they were looking for the Isles of promise they were looking for the eyes of an eagle where God had promised them that they were going to join in a in a strange land and that God was going to give them a laugh and when they went up there with 12 spies Moses setting off itself setting out one from each Rock how that he sent them all out and there was ten of them that came back and brought up a wrong report of the land but there was say there was a couple chickens there was ten chickens out there that was afraid of those giants out there you know what the problem was is they were looking from a chickens one of you and I'll tell you a chicken or run for cover every single time but there was two eagles that was sitting there that said we're more than able to take it the promises house God said it was eyes and we're good enough to take it they were not looking at it from the chickens point of view they were looking at it from the Eagles view the Eagles were flying over the Giants hallelujah they were anointed to fly above it hallelujah this eagle it's a very special bird it's very special it's eagle is built for soar and higher than any other bird this eagle is built to withstand the storms this Eagles feathers can handle it when other birds feathers can't handle it you see when that Eagle when he sees a storm coming all the other birds they begin to fly and look for cover and trying to hide out and they're there they're afraid of the storm but the Eagle is not afraid of the storm the eagle flies into the story the eagle flies higher from the end to the story you see when that eagle flies him to that storm he is getting up above he's getting up above that storm and he is testing out his wings you see when everybody else is running for cover and you run straight to the store it proves that you're an eagle when everybody else is afraid of cancer you run right to it and say you old slewfoot you ain't nothing but a devil you ain't scared of no cancer you fly above cancer when sin comes into the camp you don't run from sin you fly above sin it proves her an eagle you don't get underneath of it you get above it you were annoying it's a fly higher is that right you see a vulture brother branham said that a vultures anointed to fly - he's anointed to fly - but he cannot follow that eagle you see he can fly pretty high but he cannot see like the eagle can see a vulture cannot fall along with Hebrews 13 and eight that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he can't see that for a votes who can't fly and tell you that there is such thing as the Holy Ghost he can't see that far you see a voter just looks back to the day of Pentecost 2,000 years ago but a eagle points to it it says you can have it it says it's for your children a vulture vulture he can dance with you a vulture can praise with you a vulture can shout with you but uh votes who don't know what is shouting about I vote you don't know why singing about I vote you don't know why is dancing and shouting and praising God about he can only see so far but that's for Eagles you can see what you're praising about [Applause] I'm anointed to fly higher than what the vultures can go you know it's said that an eagle can see up to two miles through a storm he can see up to two miles to miles several miles through the darkness he could see into the night and catch his prey he can see he can see when other birds can't fly there he's anointed to fly there he's built to fly there you see when you begin to watch an eagle when that storm comes he gets up above those storms and it begins to feel his wings and what's he's doing he's putting his faith in his wings he knows that there's chaos below him he knows that he knows that that if he can get above that if he can just stretch forth his nine-foot wings that he can put his faith in those wings and if you can ever put your faith in the Holy Ghost if you can ever play and set your faith in action and realize that God's Word is right you'll fly above all of these creeds and all of these ideologies a man that's bringing in an eagle is a very special special bird an eagle can live up to 70 years live up to 70 years but at their 40th year and Eagles got to go through a process just like you had to go through a process that Eagle has to be willing to accept the pain of change that Eagle has got to be willing because if he does not change he's going to die and if you don't change from your first birth you're going to die in your sin if you're not willing to go through the pain and go through the struggle of dying out and take it on his name in water baptism you die right there but an eagle if he's worth if he feels that it's worth the change that it's worth sustaining all the pain that he's gone through got to go through the eagle flies up to the highest mountain that he can set his eyes upon and he goes up there and he waits that eagle he gets to such a spot in his life that his talons no longer are strong enough to grab his prey he goes through a spot where his feathers begin to get so heavy that he can no longer fly in the height in which he was ordained to fly and his beak in which he eats with is no longer it's become door and it's no good but the Eagle knows that if he can go to that mountain and get up on that mountain and go through the process of change that he can live on he realizes he realizes that he's more than once am I talking to you tonight he realizes only got one chance to live this life out so he's willing to go through the hard spots of life he's willing to go through the family battles for this change he's willing to take on the reproach of Jesus name for this change Oh hallelujah he's willing to be called a heretic just for this change he's not a shame to go to the melton he was born for it but the Eagle gets on that mountain and he gets up there on a hard rock and he starts beating that old beak off of his nose he starts beating it and beating it and beating it and beating it until his old beak completely falls off you see he's got to have a beak that's able to eat her food and after his new beak goes back he starts pulling out his old talents that were no longer strong enough to grab his enemy and he pulls him plucks them out one at a time all the pain of each talent he pulls out he's going through this sustaining change for a renewal of an eco and after his talons go back he starts plucking out all of his old feathers one at a time you see in those old feathers with that old cloak you couldn't fly this high come on somebody I'm preaching to you tonight with that old feather you couldn't fly and see this message that's why you had to pull all those feathers out of your experience you had to pull drinking out of your spirit of your experience you had to pray you to pull out all of that carousing and smoking and running around looking at dirty things you got to pull those things out of your experience if you want to live I wonder if there's anybody in here that wants to live tonight he begins to pull out all of his old feathers and after he pulls out all of those feathers he now takes the flight of the Eagles rebirth and he has now renewed his strength the Bible says in Isaiah 40 they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength oh I'd say tonight Church of the Living God if you can wait on God and stop waiting on your staff on yourself and holding on to yourself it's not you holding on anyhow it's gotta be God holding on to you let go of your own experiences let go of your past let go of the pain now oh yeah he's got to be able to go through the change there's a lot of people they want to walk this there's a lot of people that want to live this but they have never accepted the pain to go through the change a birth is a mess a birth hurts a birth this plane for a birth is a mess and a lot of people don't want to die out they like holding on to that old man too much they like staying there in that condition where they can cuss and live anyway they won't through and come to church when it suits them they want to live in that condition but if you want to fly higher than a bunch of chickens you got to go through a change you got to go through a process I can baptize every single one of your family members back here but a lot of time we baptize them a dry sinner and we bring them up a Wes here but this house is full tonight of people that was willing to accept the change that was not willing to stay there a narrow stupor in that Oh condition but they wanted to fly above all of the chicken chaos mercy you know I I've been guilty in life and I I'm not ashamed to say it but I've been guilty for talking to chickens like they were Eagles I'll be honest with you I've been guilty of talking the chickens like they were egos but I want you to write this down I ain't never been wrong and I'll never be guilty of talking to an eagle like their chicken if you were born to fly that harm will tell you were born to fly that high if you were born to walk this Christian walk I'm gonna tell you you were born to walk a Christian walk I don't know who is and I don't know who ain't but I would never take away your god-given rights to fly this high to live this message to be this message we'd come here to talk about it we come to get into it if all we come here is to spit out some large and just preach a little bit so that we'll get your hand claps and your accolades we're doing nothing but I didn't come here to talk to you about a God at yesterday I come tonight to put on the table of eagles a god that's still the same yesterday today and forever let me be guilty of telling the truth I was talking this past week with my wife just going over these things that about what God is doing amongst us I'm not taking away from yesterday's revival we needed that revival to get us where we're at we're just talking about these things that God is doing for us how he has taken us at higher levels how he's taking this to a higher level of fries a higher level of singing you're witnesses the night here and out of our home that had telephone hookups you're a witness that you're singing from a different position you're worshiping at a new level a higher level we're talking about these things that God has taken us to a higher level of worship a higher level of praise I've never seen the word priest in such demonstrative power like we're watching it come forth in this hour when you're seeing God do a quick work in this hour when you see when you've seen all of the things he'll that how they used to how that you would feel your house is full of tapes and it would cost a family ten thousand dollars for a set of tapes but now you can buy that same exact yeah absolute condition in the same exact way on a little small SD card for twelve dollars it's the advancement young ministers are grabbing this message and running in with this message like never before when you used to see men of God that would come to a pulpit and they would have stacks of books and and and all the messages lined out and would have to pull that from this message that message and that message just to build their sermon but now it's in our fingertips God is taking us as the bride of Jesus Christ to a higher level he has not taken us past his word but he's taken us to a spot of rapture we were going over these things just talking about these things but this is what God has called us to and I'm happy to be living in the hour in which God has called us to this moment this is where eagles have gathered but you know a chicken came praise where you praise a chicken he can't go where you go a chicken can't dance like you dance and a chicken came worship like you worship a chicken can't soar like the eagle soars and shaken was born to be a chicken I take it you flap his wings and get up on a little static or I put a little pulse and and he can set up hair on his roost that's what he was born to do but that chicken could never fly will you fly it ain't got nothing to get chicken I hate a few of them every week but a chicken a chicken can't move where I move you know an eagle makes love in the air an eagle reproduces in the air you know when an eagle gets up there he know he ain't hooked up with some vulture I'm gonna talk to your knife you see a tegu can fly on another level he can fly so high that when he could go straight to the Sun that a film comes over his eyes and can flower I declare that Sun and he will not burst apart but a vulture trying to fire player he'll bust and he'll disintegrate in a moment young people I'm talking to you tonight if they came fly that high it proves to you that they ain't an eagle if they can't live his message it proves to you that they ain't and Eagle and Eagle can only dance that high and nobody else can dance there and Eagle can love on a totally different level than vultures and buzzards and chickens too and Eagle can stretch forth its wings like no other bird and he can fly but the stores fly above creats fly above darkness that Eagle can fly above people telling us that we got no right to worship let me just slow down here for a moment my pop Spencer used to preach a message it's hard to soar with Eagles when you're living with buzzards and if you're feasting on the dead carrion of the world you're not feasting on he goes man but I want you to know that I take what I do very seriously all of you know me quite well I'm a I'm a let me say it's right way I can be known to be a character I can do I can cut up and have a good time and I believe we should have a good time I believe that we as Christians ought to be able to enjoy our religion and enjoy our salvation but I take what I do very seriously I do it with all my heart and my soul and every energy that's within me I do with everything that's within me when I come out here as a song leader I don't just give half an effort when I'm caught on the singing especial I don't just sing it's just a song because of this song I want to sing a song that are taking me to a new level I want to sing a song that will create the same atmosphere that got my attention that it'll get your attention when I'm choosing songs have songs of worship I want to choose a song that'll so make you praise God that'll make you forget about what you just went through in your car before you got here I want to I want to sing such a song that you'll forget about what your boss said about you I want to sing and pray bring down the praises brain just begin to act out the praises of God so that when we begin to lift our voice and lift our hands and lift our worship as the praises of God go up the blessings of God begin to fall upon our lives I take what I do very seriously when I come to this pulpit to preach to you as a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ I had know that I am responsible for every word that comes across my lips so I do it with everything that's within me and I say God not my will but thy will be done I don't want one word to come out of my mouth that'll hurt your children or afflict them or or instruct their walk with you I want to be right I take what I do very seriously and I believe that you should take very seriously what you do in your pew I believe that you ought to come into the house of God and you ought to get yourself ready I believe you ought to pray I believe you ought to sing when there's a song going forth I believe that when the song leaders say you ought to back him up whether you like the song whether you don't like the song get behind him God inspired him to sing that song maybe for one person what would it do if you begin to sing like you never sing before you might actually get born again I believe you ought to take it serious if you're one of these instruments that play one of these instruments up here you ought to do it with everything that's within you I'm gonna call names sister Deborah ought to do with everything that's within sister Cassie ought to do it with everything that's within brother Jeffery brother Donnie sister Emma sister Sarah bad brother matters all of these ought to do it with everything that's within them if God is taking us to a higher level of praise let our musicians be ready to praise Him and then let all the congregation sing in with one unity sing the song of sign sing the praises of God if God is taking us to a higher level of preaching I worship on a match the word I take what I do very seriously and when I hear my critics tell me that I should no longer worship God you know I I'm a Bible believer and I believe that everything that I preach ought to come out of this Bible and if it ain't coming out of this Bible then I shouldn't be preaching it that's why I preach this message to you because I can line it up with a Bible but when my critics are telling me that I had that I should no longer worship God and I should no longer praise God I do when I was taught to do I take it back to the Bible and you know I find that it didn't take me very long to find out that God likes worship and God likes to praise for the Bible says in Psalms 150 praise ye the Lord praise God in His sanctuary praise Him in the firmament of his power praising him for his mighty acts praise him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of a trumpet praise and with a sultry and a heart I didn't forget you sister April you were just hiding back here praise him with that saxophone praise him with the timbrel praise him with a dance praise him with string instruments and on oregon's praise him on the loud sound cymbals praise him on the high sounding cymbals let everything exclude and everyone in this building unless you're dead tonight let everything that hath breath praise he the Lord oh yeah oh yeah I was anointed to do it someone do it take that critics I take what I do very seriously when I come and stand behind this pulpit when people tell me then I should stop preaching and they tell me how to put a tape player right up here and I said let that tape player preach to you instead of me standing up here and giving you chewed up food I take it very seriously so what I do I go back to the Bible and I find out what the Bible says and the Bible says that house said they hear without a preacher I found what the Bible said so I'm going to stay with the Bible the Bible tells me to police summer preach I was anointed to fly higher than what they have said brother did he they told me I shouldn't worship and I'm flying higher than what they said they told me I shouldn't preach nother nathanael but I'm flying higher than what they said I've also heard the same critics tell me that we ought to stop all that emotion you know what I did I went back to the prophets message and the prophets message said that anything with Alamelu emotion is dead and you need the barrier I'll take what the Prophet said over your criticism can I say it like a prophet said it here and I'll take Church of the Living God do you know where you staying you are predestinated to do it and if the bridegroom could do it what about his bride come up hither come up a little bit higher don't stay down there in the chicken yard come up higher I will not be bailed the earth bound chicken I will be the bound by their surgeon I won't be bound by their clucking I'm anointed to fly above it you can be seated I got those same critics and whether you know it's tonight they're not just my critics brother Ron's critics brother Tim's critics they're your critics they tell us that we ought to stop preaching now we ought to stop worshipping God and we ought to move on past emotion and it's time to get back to the word well let me put you on notice tonight if you haven't noticed that's why I am preaching that's why I am singing that's why I am dancing that's why I am selling that's why I am praising God that's why I am worshipping that's like I'm doing that's why I'm doing what I'm doing is because I came back to the world and if you don't like that watch this you didn't like my preaching 10 years ago well if God terrorists in more years I'm gonna be still preaching I may have a little bit more gray hair and I might be a little slow in my step what while I'm mortal once I'm gonna preach with everything that's within me I'm anointed to fly above it you're anointed to fly but believe the sign you're anointed to fly above all the critics fly above them Eagles when you get up that high they know I may not be able to see you but you can

somebody move forward and start progressing in their life just tell them they can't do it and something will rise up on the inside of them it'll rise up on the inside of them that'll make them do it you tell it you tell somebody that they're gonna be bound to a wheelchair the rest of their days and you'll watch that person work tirelessly to get out of that wheelchair I'm personal friends with a bull rider that was crushed in every part of his lower body and the doctors told him he was paralyzed he was completely tore up all types of organs were destroyed that they had to place back together and the doctors came in and they told him that you'll never walk again and he looked right back up in their eyes and he said wrong number doctor you don't call the wrong number I'm gonna walk again and you know he works every day because he had the right mental attitude and he's walking just tell somebody they can't do it I'm personal friends with a pastor that the doctors told him that he would never work again and now today he works more than 10 men I'm personal friends with a pastor that the doctors told him that he'd never walk again that he'd be bound in a wheelchair but not only is he walking he's running I'm personal friends with a pastor where doctors told him that his lungs would never be able to sustain to preach this gospel again [Applause] they told him that he couldn't do it but he was anointed to fly higher than the doctors orders and he preaches convention after convention after convention Satan just tell me I can't do it and I'll prove your own tell me I can't praise God and that's exactly what I'm going to do tell me I can't sing tell me I can't worship that's exactly what I'm going to do you want to see young people move fool push them into action try and tell

swore that you destroy him oh but he was anointed to fly higher Jesus will not leave you where he found you but he will take you higher you look over in the book of John chapter 5 in verse 8 when he's standing there with the impotent man that laid there thirty-eight years in this infirmity and Jesus says Roz Roz Roz said take up thy bed and walk Jesus did not leave him walking in that condition he walked away on another level but the Denny when he came to this message 20-some years ago you're walking on another level today brother Nathaniel you're walking your families walking on a higher level today may we never may we never be satisfied let me say this I'm perfectly satisfied with the seal that he put on my life but we should never be satisfied with where we're at we should never get complacent and never get stagnant and allow wiggle tails in our experience I'm on somebody we should never invite in all the all the all the charismatic things and all the things of the world we ought to have a holy place we ought to have a holy worship we ought to have a holy dance come on somebody if we go - let's do it's right and we're gonna praise God let's do it right because we're you're
