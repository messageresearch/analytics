time and what are great things that are happening among us and and uh you know sure the devil's fighting but he's supposed to he's supposed to i've had a rough evening last night and a rough morning this morning but you know he's supposed to do that and i'm getting ready to do what i'm supposed to do amen so i can't defeat him with my flesh he's got that whip but i can tell you this i can defeat him by the word of god maybe it's your first time to hear but we're to we're we're fighting we're fighting and winning with brain cancer and lung cancer and we're going to win and i i'm not not gonna lose i we're gonna win and so and so we're taking very powerful medicine chemo to to to combat that as well and it's the chemo that makes me very sick along with the sugar and so and so we just we're going to win we're going to win we have tough moments but this ain't hollywood no way and so and so we're just thankful for what god's doing for brian in the hospital we're thankful for that amen when you're on the brink of disaster just just put your hand out jesus is there and so we're we continue to believe i'm thankful that i got to have prayer with him just before he went on the vent and that was a very it was a very nice thing and so we're thankful for that for those that don't know last week before service at home we i saw a vision of wesley carrying wesley down the aisle and praying with wesley and the visions happened just like that and so i saw it take place and i just said lord and here's my words i said lord i'm just a human being i said lord he won't come to me he won't go to nobody and and so i just said lord he won't come to me and so and so then and then i felt the nudge and i felt a nudge and then i felt the nudge and i went and got him this week has been miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle whether you realize it that's a generational miracle amen and we believe that that weakness in his body won't be passed to his children so when you see him running out of church ahead of his mom don't you stop him that's a miracle amen god bless you amen we love you you know god dwells in the praises of his people he inhabits that's where he lives you and i want to be where he lives i would be whether where he's at i'd rather be there than where he was at they'd build monuments and places because they recognized too late that that's where they were but they would build a monument to it or a museum to it but i want to be where he's at we believe we're in the last revival just before the coming of the lord it's called the bride's revival and the reason it's going on amongst you because you are the bride and it is him not a man not a personality not a not somebody we're looking to it's him that stir in the waters hallelujah just get in the water's fine just get in we're stepping into what adam stepped out of he's going to change our bodies not just take care of cancer he's going to change our bodies we're going to be changed in the moment of the twinkle of an eye it is the mighty angel that is working among us and he's manifested the word for the day and so we're feasting on heavenly manna and so the rapture is happening you may feel like a caterpillar hang on a little while you'll be flying like a butterfly oh glory hallelujah hallelujah ah then look any good to us psalms chapter 102 and verse 16 this morning we have certainly enjoyed we've got a lot to do today and i've got a i've got a load on my my fork today i tell you what here's what i'm going to do since my body has went through what it's went through the last 24 hours or 18 hours or 16 hours i'm going to ask you to help me preach yes is that all right i'm going to ask you to help me preach i'm i'm so sore i can't stand it in my in my stomach where i've been doing all of that and i'm going to tell you what i've been doing but you understand so we're all up through my rib cage but hey i'm reporting for duty but i'm asking for help amen i feel like you could help anyway and so amen you pull we believe god you look good sitting there brother donny god bless you psalm chapter 102 verse 16 then we'll go to revelations chapter five and verse one you help me we will get through and we will enjoy this this morning when the lord shall build up zion he shall appear in his glory he will regard the prayer of the destitute and despise not the prayer this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the lord this is what the prophet said you would do you'll praise the lord you've been created by god and now we will turn and praise the lord revelations chapter 5 and verse 1 and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne and a book written within and on the backside seal with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much now let me just say this to you all of the prophets was not worthy all the kings was not worthy the greatest men of life was not worthy and john begins to realize nobody's worthy to take the book and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb this is where our praise goes to stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand and set up on the throne and when he had taken the book and the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hearts and golden vowels of holders which are the prayers of the saints notice these next words and they sung a new song thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou whistling and hast redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred tongue and people and nation and has made us unto god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth and i beheld and i heard the voice of the angels round about the throne and the beast and the elders and the number of them was ten thousands times ten thousands thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and in the earth and under the earth and and such as are in the sea and all that then the herd i say in blessing and honor and glory and power unto him that sitteth upon the throne unto the lamb for ever and ever hallelujah and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever just go ahead and praise him right now he's worthy he's worthy of all praise and honor and glory glory to the lamb of god hallelujah you may be seated this morning and may the lord bless the reading of his word i read a statement here a while back that really struck my heart i thought it was a good spot to put it today i asked god why are you taking me through such troubled water and he replied because your enemies can't swim [Applause] brother man says let satan take after a believer listen closely let satan take after a believer and he's got jesus christ on his hands so we turn loose to the one that the angel of god against the enemy that has troubled you and me the avenger with blood on his hands ready to fight your battle for you are you with me listen you think you're fighting it alone let me just say you and i wouldn't be a second in the face of an enemy like we have to fight but when jesus is on our side we can't lose times in your life that it looks like everything's upside down on your job in your home sometimes it seems like you can't say a good word in your home because the tension is so hard the devil is fighting it ain't your wife it ain't your husband that's the devil thought you might drive all the way to church and not say a word maybe an hour at a time and drive and not say a word to each other it's the devil that does that ain't your husband or your wife you may go weeks at a time having trouble and you think what's wrong you married her and she married you you love her with all your hearts and you may have to go through some difficult times this ain't hollywood but instead of fighting one another fight the devil with all of your heart turn the tide on him turn the tide on him [Applause] you see the one difference between israel and the rest of all the nations is god amen the one difference between israel and the rest of the nations what's god put god to one side and israel is just like any other nation when such when samson cut off his hair he was just like any other man but the leadership of the holy ghost assad and the church is nothing but the world with god's name attached to it the world and the church are all the same lump just like jacob and esau were of their of the same parents but the spirit of god makes the difference [Applause] take god out of any of us and we're just an animal you read the news you see what's going on in the world not going to spend a second hardly here but i want you to understand the difference between them and you is god the world is falling apart because they don't have god [Applause] the reason that you've made a lot of mistakes in your life and you keep repeating the same process is you don't have god don't blame your neighbor don't bring your friends don't blame somebody else blame it on yourself and say i need god in my life don't wait till tomorrow don't wait till next week it seems to be the conspiracy condition of the church they failed to see the hour that they're living in they're looking for some sensation or something something way off in the future man is forever doing that he always blesses god for what he has done looking forward to what he will do and ignore what he's doing right i want to say this to you you may have accomplished a lot of things this past week you may be looking forward to accomplish a lot of things this coming week but the most important thing you're doing in the both weeks is sitting right here don't let satan rock you get in the moment of it last night we heard about myram and meyer i'm taking a tambourine after she had watched all of the enemy the greatest army in the world [Applause] and she grabbed a tambourine and began to dance it is calculated that there were 600 adult women 600 000 adult women on that coast that day i would say it was quite a storm [Music] [Applause] you know some people say well we shouldn't get emotional this is probably not the best service for those kind of people but let me just say this you if seeing your enemies drowned don't get you emotional there is a problem with your eyes in your revelation we're not careful we'll occupy a pew we'll forget where we came from some of us were drunks dope addicts harlots prostitutes and worse than all of that was religious devil set and steal you were the same devil on sunday as you was on friday and what you was in didn't change your life but once you come to the revelated truth and it changes you from the bottom of your souls to the top of your head there ought to be something thankful for you're not a slave to those habits anymore in your life we ought to stop and give god thanks with everything that's within us our local denomination we don't do it like there like that there when you go back to your denomination [Music] and you look at what they approve of don't you cut bringing your perverted religion in this business we don't believe in perverted living we don't really drinking and smoking and lying and cheating rubbing out on your wife abusive little children like them catholic priests do out there we are believing that's straight amen second samuel chapter 6 and verse 14 and david danced before the lord with all of his might david girded with a linen e plot and david also and david so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of the lord we're shouting and with the sound of a trumpet and the ark of the lord came into the city of david michaels and michelle saul's daughter looked through a window and saw the king leaping and dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart and they brought in the ark of the lord and said it in his place and in the midst of the tabernacle and david had pitched for it and david offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord and david returned to bless his household and michelle the daughter of saul came out of to meet david and said how glorious was the king of israel today who uncovered himself today in his in the eyes of the handmaidens and of his servants as one of a vain fellow shamelessly uncovereth himself and david said unto michelle it was before the lord we are dancing for a man we ain't dancing for some personality we're dancing for god our worship is to god amen [Applause] and it was before the lord which chose me before thy father and before all his house to anoint me ruler over the people of the lord over israel therefore i will play before the lord and i will yet be thou more vile than this and will base in my own sight of the handmaids my maidservants which thou hast spoken of of them shall i be had in honor now i want you to just notice to the critic of praise to the church that refuses worship like you say well brother ron we're aware of another nationality we don't have the american spirit on us let me just say this to you being a german being a european being whatever you are that's not give you excuse to be lazy in your worship preacher to the janitor you have a responsibility before god and let me just say this you this is why churches are dead [Applause] someday i want to preach again on the autopsy of a dead church this is why churches die they refuse to give praise they refuse to give an atmosphere to where children will come and enjoy the presence of the lord where they'll grow up in an atmosphere of worship so go ahead with your dead self let your church die god's going to have a church without spark or without blemish that will not be ashamed to worship the lord it reminds me of the story brother brahman says he said it reminds me of a story of a fellow had a great big fine barn he built a great big fine barn just as dignified and classy as if you could be but he was too lazy to farm there was a farmer live close to him he didn't have much of a barn but he really was a farmer he put plenty of good food in that barn in that barn that year two little cows was born one in one barn one in the other when springtime come they turned the little calves out of the stall that little calf over there over here had been fed real good my when that wind began to hit it hit him oh my he kicked up his heels and away he went as hard as he could starting and a jumping and a bucking and going on the other farmer turned his out and over there he had had nothing to eat but weeds too lazy to farm too lazy to feed him puts me in a mind of some of these pastors too lazy to trifle just dignified barns is all you got [Applause] some food in there for that calf the baptism of the holy ghost preached with power it'll scorch them that's right but that's what they need is some good old-fashioned scorching that's what the church needs members needs this little old calf and men poor little fella out in the stall so thin he could hardly walk peeped around the crack looked across and he seen the other tap just as snorting he was all fat and round thank god to be fat and round he felt good he had been eating all winter that little starved calf looked up and said such fanaticism my sure he wasn't too skinny to think anything else but i tell you when that one that had been fattened up all winter he knew where he was at he was having a good time with that warm wind begin to blow on him and any man that's not the born again of the spirit of god they'll call him a fanatic and anything else but when that warm spring holy ghost wind begins to come like it did on the day of pentecost something's going to take place the warm winds is going to begin to blow brother you're all fattened up with the gospel been feeling good kick up your heels had a good time that's the way myram did she looked back down and saw them old things that they were once once done was all dead and gone they'd they'd done seeing god accepted blood seen his power in divine healing standing between them through the red sea baptized with the spirit walked on the other side just having a good time they didn't care what some organization thought about it what a perfect type it is today of a believer who will dare to step out god's promised that he'd supply every need he promised he'd supply our every need he never told them i'll make a way he never told them i will make a way of your healing i will make a way of this or this make a way of that he said i will be with you he said to us i will be with you even in you to the end of the world that's all i have to say you don't have to argue this this that or the other if he's here that satisfies me divine healing's here divine healing's here power is here everything that he was is here now jesus christ is the same yesterday today in for helper you can take your theology and drown with it but brother i believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever i believe i will be with you even in you to the [Applause] [Music] this is what this next quote is what started this entire sermon and today the scientific theory of modern so-called religious groups has tried to prove that this blessing blesseth thing that we have called the holy spirit is only emotion see if it just don't stand up according to their scientific theory well i would like to ask them this what makes them change what makes a drunkard stop drinking what makes a prostitute cease from her evil living what makes the cancer the disease depart from people yeah i'm talking to you satan you might as well stay and miss it [Applause] some of these puny weep wimpy preachers that ain't never had to go through nothing can stand up and challenge the devil thank god for their carriage but i can stand here with brain cancer lung cancer cancer in my body god's a healer is that emotion it has emotion with it anything that's alive has a motion and anything that doesn't have emotion is dead i want to remind you god's not coming back for a mannequin blood [Applause] he's not coming back for a religious play toy i could have put it in other language he's coming back for a bride that's got life on the inside of her here's life excuse the expression but i think we ought to bury some of these dead emotionless religions because it's dead it has no emotion to it anything any religion that has not emotion should be buried [Applause] because it's emotional [Music] jesus when he entered into the city the children of of all of them and all of his friends crying holds diana hosanna him that cometh in the name of the lord and those religionists of that day
