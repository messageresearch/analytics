[44:27] through thy name they had had a good
[44:29] oldfashioned charismatic time hadn't
[44:33] they amen and he said unto them I beheld
[44:37] Satan as lightning fall from Heaven it's
[44:39] quite a statement Jesus
[44:42] response behold I give unto you power to
[44:45] tread on serpents and scorpions and over
[44:48] all the power of the
[44:50] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[44:54] hurt you notwithstanding in this Rejoice
[44:59] not that the the spirits are subject
[45:02] unto you I love this next statement but
[45:05] rather
[45:06] Rejoice because your names are written
[45:09] in
[45:11] heaven Hallelujah and in that hour Jesus
[45:15] rejoiced in the spirit and said I thank
[45:17] thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth
[45:21] that thou has hid these things from the
[45:24] wise and prudent and revealed them unto
[45:27] the babes even so father for so it is
[45:31] seemed good in thy
[45:34] sight all things are delivered to me of
[45:37] my father and no man knoweth that whom
[45:41] the son is but the father and who the
[45:43] father is but the son and he to whom the
[45:46] son will reveal him and he turned him
[45:50] unto the disciples and said
[45:52] privately blessed are the eyes which see
[45:56] the the things that you see and I tell
[46:00] you that many prophets and Kings have
[46:04] desired to see those things which you
[46:06] see and have not seen them and to hear
[46:10] those things which you hear and have not
[46:13] heard them maybe you have a need on your
[46:15] heart you just like to say brother Ron
[46:17] would you remember remember me in prayer
[46:20] amen let's pray Heavenly Father how we
[46:23] love you today and we already feel your

[47:05] of every one of us and Lord all of us
[47:08] want more of your spirit living inside

[47:13] would touch our hearts and touch our
[47:15] lives and minister to us in a special
[47:18] way we pray in Jesus Christ's name we
[47:20] ask you and we all say amen God bless
[47:24] you as you are seated today
[47:33] this week is a very emotional week for
[47:35] me and I begin to think back a few years
[47:38] ago I was at brother Danny
[47:43] steemans um it was the month before it
[47:45] was actually the month of that I would
[47:48] get a cancer diagnosis and we had held
[47:51] the meeting together and it was brother
[47:53] Tim PR brother Timothy PR and brother
[47:55] Jason Jackson and my myself spoke that
[47:58] meeting at brother Danny steemans that
[48:00] year and we had had a wonderful meeting
[48:03] the last service we had finished up and
[48:06] we were to we were to fly out the next
[48:08] morning each of us was flying out in
[48:09] different times and and uh that night
[48:12] I'd went to bed and and I had a vision
[48:15] as I went to
[48:16] bed it was a vision to where that I
[48:19] would see as I would go and begin to
[48:21] walk through a utter chaos I can't
[48:24] describe how dark that place was or how
[48:26] Wicked that it was and I was just
[48:28] walking down through it and and I just I
[48:32] begin to see all of the things that was
[48:34] crashing in and it looked like it looked
[48:37] like uh just a horror of a
[48:39] nightmare when I got to the very bottom
[48:42] of that I would find sister
[48:46] Melissa and and and I would see her
[48:50] there and she was in a very difficult
[48:53] spot at that time and so I would see her
[48:55] there and I would see her and in all of
[48:59] that Darkness I saw a ray of
[49:02] light as it would come down on her and I
[49:06] I just walked up to her and I said are
[49:08] you ready to go
[49:10] home and she took me by the arm and she
[49:13] said I'm ready to go
[49:15] home it took a few years for that to
[49:19] happen but we're going to have a wedding
[49:21] this week brother Tom and sister Melissa
[49:25] and that Vision will will be
[49:30] [Applause]
[49:39] fulfilled I want to give another part of
[49:41] that you cannot imagine in the spring I
[49:45] was going through a very difficult time
[49:47] and I knew this was being
[49:49] planned and there was a brother Doug
[49:52] there was a a guy in my ear Whispering
[49:55] you'll never live to preach that wedding
[49:58] well I want to tell that guy that's been
[50:00] whispering in my ear he didn't have the
[50:03] final
[50:05] say so we thank God for
[50:15] that amen isn't isn't he
[50:19] wonderful isn't he wonderful I want to
[50:21] thank you for all your prayers and
[50:24] everything that you have prayed for us
[50:25] and
[50:27] and just so that guy that's whispering
[50:29] in my ear I'm I'm booking meetings for
[50:31] next year so he might as well just be
[50:35] quiet for a
[50:40] while I think we're in a very crucial
[50:43] hour and I just want to share some
[50:46] things on my heart I think we're in a
[50:47] very crucial hour and we're witnessing
[50:51] what Jesus is talking about Kings and
[50:54] Prophets would like to see the age that
[50:57] you and I are seeing and sometimes we
[51:00] don't understand kind of all the things
[51:02] that are happening if it wasn't for the
[51:04] prophet of the Lord to come in this age
[51:06] we couldn't put nothing together and so
[51:09] he would begin to describe things for
[51:11] you and I'm not going to go too far in
[51:13] that angle but and so we realize that
[51:16] that what we're seeing and what we're
[51:18] witnessing the bride's Revival that is
[51:21] going on um brother brother Gab actually
[51:27] after the prayer line last night in Ohio
[51:30] brother Gabe got in the car somewhere
[51:32] around 10:30 and he drove all the way
[51:34] home so he wins the award for today of
[51:38] driving the most and and so uh so three
[51:42] energy drinks will bring you a long way
[51:45] so but we're witnessing incredible
[51:48] events taking
[51:50] place but we we realize that God will
[51:54] not leave one that's right that's
[51:57] right he'll not leave one here and God
[52:01] has determined that every one of us
[52:04] we're going to make
[52:08] it we're going to make
[52:10] it and and he is he is moving on our
[52:14] protols to come home he is moving on
[52:18] every seed and and we realize that we're
[52:20] living in a very crucial moment the
[52:23] junction of time time is
[52:27] basically intercepted with prophecy and
[52:30] we're watching it be fulfilled in
[52:33] politics in
[52:35] war Israel's fighting for its own
[52:38] existence not only that the bride has
[52:41] awakened in this day and she realizes
[52:44] who who she is and what she stands for
[52:48] and that she is an invincible Army we
[52:51] recognize what Satan has tried to do to
[52:54] destroy the Bride of Jesus Christ Christ
[52:57] and listen let me just say this to you
[52:59] that seat of God that's on the inside of
[53:02] you the scripture says that it would
[53:04] deceive the very elected if it were
[53:09] possible if but brother Brandon would
[53:12] answer that and say because of that
[53:14] predestinated
[53:17] seed it is not possible for you to be
[53:23] deceived so sometimes we come to church
[53:26] we get up on a Sunday morning and we
[53:28] come on a Saturday night and we think
[53:30] well this is just another day I want you
[53:33] to understand in Satan's kingdom he has
[53:36] tried everything
[53:40] abely he's tried everything to stop
[53:45] you he's throw the very best bait he can
[53:48] he's throwed every demon that he can
[53:51] against you and you're still
[53:54] standing amen you're still standing and
[53:58] there's nothing that he's got that can
[54:01] stop you because you came from God and
[54:05] you're going back to
[54:07] God the prophecies that have been
[54:10] prophesied for all of this time it's
[54:12] becoming history almost by the
[54:19] day and we can say these words even now
[54:22] Lord come Jesus Lord Jesus
[54:26] we can tell the devil give way in the
[54:28] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we can
[54:31] look as brother brandom would preach in
[54:33] desperation Shake Yourself pinch your
[54:37] conscience he would make the statements
[54:39] over and over again don't miss it
[54:44] now don't miss it now and I think about
[54:48] this tonight as or today as I stand here
[54:51] before you I would hate to get this
[54:54] close before the coming of the Lord
[54:58] and miss
[55:00] it I would really hate to get right up
[55:04] to to the ark door being
[55:07] closed and Noah didn't close the ark God
[55:11] closed the
[55:12] ark and I would hate to get this close
[55:16] before the Rapture the
[55:19] resurrection I just drop this in I would
[55:22] hate to be the ones in the
[55:25] household and individuals in the
[55:27] household go well there there's mom
[55:31] there's Grandma you see her coming up
[55:33] the up the yard you do you see her no I
[55:38] have to be honest with you I I don't see
[55:45] her I'd hate to get this
[55:48] close and Miss what's going
[55:51] on Sir now I want you to just think
[55:54] about this and we just preached this a
[55:57] couple uh couple of weeks ago the
[56:00] serpants of Matthew Mark Luke and
[56:03] John they made sure because they were
[56:07] guarding the book of Acts and they made
[56:11] sure that those that were not
[56:14] seed couldn't see
[56:17] it but he made sure that those that were
[56:22] seed couldn't help but see it
[56:27] that's enough to shout about right there
[56:29] so it blinded the eyes we just made the
[56:32] statement it's laying right here there
[56:35] went the prophet of God in 1946 and he
[56:38] begin to preach the deity of Jesus
[56:41] Christ he would meet the angel then he
[56:43] would begin to go forth with the message
[56:45] of the hour and go all over the world
[56:48] but when it comes towards
[56:51] 5657 brother Brandon would stand there
[56:53] and say America has rejected Ed it she's
[56:58] turned down the message she's turned
[57:00] down her call and then there goes Billy
[57:03] Graham and all Roberts their tents are
[57:06] getting
[57:07] bigger they're being socially
[57:12] accepted but the message has been turned
[57:14] down but the messengers to
[57:17] Sodom they became more popular as they
[57:20] went along let me just say this message
[57:23] will never be socially correct
[57:28] it'll never be accepted by the world but
[57:31] I want you to understand for that
[57:33] predestinated
[57:35] seat for that predestinated seed he
[57:39] knows how to find
[57:41] you well that's enough to shake us right
[57:44] quickly no matter where you're at he
[57:46] knows how to find you brother Ben he
[57:49] knows how to come and get you he knows
[57:51] how he get you Brother David when you
[57:54] wasn't looking for it
[57:58] right now remember this the scripture
[58:00] says Jesus would Jesus would say it no
[58:04] man can come to me except my father
[58:07] draws him and all that the father has
[58:11] given me will come yes sir don't you
[58:15] love it now remember God is his own
[58:18] interpreter it won't be left up to a man
[58:21] a feeble Mind of a man to interpret his
[58:25] word amen Lord and I want you to
[58:29] understand sometimes we think about
[58:30] visions and the reason I dropped that in
[58:33] for you the reason I dropped that
[58:35] in is maybe through the last few years
[58:38] you said brother Ron I didn't see what
[58:40] you saw maybe I didn't see this or maybe
[58:43] I didn't see that but I could hold on to
[58:46] the rest of
[58:48] assurance that God knows how to fulfill
[58:51] his word brother Brandon would talk
[58:53] about the Carib move he would talk about
[58:56] the Silver Tip grizzly bear he would
[58:58] talk about different visions and you
[59:00] know the prophet saw the
[59:04] vision and knowing god wouldn't miss his
[59:08] words even in the prayer lines that
[59:10] night after night after night he would
[59:12] see visions that would take him back 40
[59:15] years or talking take him back and those
[59:17] Visions would stand there and not only
[59:20] see the the the years ago but see the
[59:23] present and then see the future
[59:26] God not only saw you now but he saw you
[59:30] before the foundation of the
[59:33] world so I want you to understand
[59:36] sometimes the devil will whisper in your
[59:39] ear and here's where we want to get a
[59:42] very good foundation tonight because as
[59:45] we go toward the Rapture he's going to
[59:48] work harder than ever
[59:50] before you will not be able to defeat
[59:53] him on your emotions
[59:56] your
[59:57] feelings but you will take him back to
[1:00:00] the word of
[1:00:01] God you'll take him back to the word and
[1:00:04] say right here is where God thought of
[1:00:07] me and if he ever thought of me he will
[1:00:11] never unthink of
[1:00:14] me
[1:00:15] hallu now remember it's not a book of
[1:00:20] man it's the book of God and the man who
[1:00:24] sees the vision or hears God's
[1:00:28] voice never un misunderstood it many
[1:00:31] times thems and in many cases Isaiah
[1:00:34] would have the vision Behold a virgin
[1:00:38] shall
[1:00:39] conceive go to his grave and maybe never
[1:00:43] understood it but it was God's voice it
[1:00:47] was God's word yes sir and if God spoke
[1:00:51] it that's exactly the way it's going to
[1:00:54] be are you with me now remember God is
[1:00:58] in his word and God will fulfill his
[1:01:02] word and Satan is always standing near
[1:01:07] trying to defeat the plan of God so if
[1:01:11] you're the final voice brother Doug if
[1:01:14] you're the final voice you are where God
[1:01:17] is
[1:01:18] happening
[1:01:20] hallelu so Mary when she said be it unto
[1:01:24] me according to to Thy word she was
[1:01:27] where God was
[1:01:32] happening every day she was confessing
[1:01:35] I'm carrying the
[1:01:37] Messiah every day she was giving that
[1:01:40] testimony I met an
[1:01:44] angel every day she was reminding this
[1:01:48] is what the angel said to me and I
[1:01:50] believed him in his word that was where
[1:01:53] God was happening in at that
[1:01:57] day but you're in a different
[1:02:00] day and you are where God is happening
[1:02:03] at in this
[1:02:06] day are you with me God's Vision has
[1:02:11] been for told since the beginning and
[1:02:14] now you are carrying out walking out
[1:02:16] talking out thinking
[1:02:23] of wow
[1:02:26] you're the very creative word of God
[1:02:29] being manifested in this day now I want
[1:02:33] you to just notice I want to go a
[1:02:35] different way Israel is under intense
[1:02:39] attacks oh
[1:02:41] yeah every day from the enemy their very
[1:02:45] existence they're being threatened to be
[1:02:48] driven into the
[1:02:53] ocean just last week they dest destroyed
[1:02:56] two leaders of
[1:02:58] Hamas and even even Iran is trying to
[1:03:02] figure out how did they pull that off
[1:03:05] being an extremely protected
[1:03:08] area no doubt the devil goes how did God
[1:03:13] pull that

[1:07:42] time when others went it's not it's not
[1:07:45] for me and they went off of the scene
[1:07:47] many of them are dead now many of them

[1:07:52] still standing
[1:07:55] how many of your friends that you parted
[1:07:59] with and then you turned around and
[1:08:02] tried to give this to
[1:08:06] them are you with me listen you can't
[1:08:09] give a predestinated
[1:08:11] seat but this ought to be something you
[1:08:13] can shout about this
[1:08:16] morning what held
[1:08:19] you what energized you what caused you
[1:08:24] to have a Revival in your soul that
[1:08:27] Satan can't put out I'll tell you that
[1:08:30] Eternal part of
[1:08:31] [Applause]
[1:08:37] you I want you to just think about this
[1:08:40] in Matthew chapter
[1:08:42] one and the Book of the generation of
[1:08:44] Jesus Christ the son of David the son of
[1:08:47] Abraham Abraham begat
[1:08:50] Isaac and Isaac begat Jacob and Jacob
[1:08:54] begat Judas and his Brethren and and
[1:08:57] Judas begat
[1:08:59] FZ and zarra of
[1:09:04] Tamar and FZ begat ezam and ezam begat
[1:09:08] amram and amram begat
[1:09:12] Amad it goes right on down to Salomon
[1:09:16] and Salomon begat Boaz of R of
[1:09:21] Rahab and you could just preach from
[1:09:23] right there you could just preach from
[1:09:26] right there how it looks so sinful and
[1:09:30] it looks so
[1:09:33] lost and it looked like a dead
[1:09:36] end for the lon of the tribe of
[1:09:41] Judah I'm doing something with this and
[1:09:44] it looked like it was so horrible and
[1:09:47] under such a situation how can a
[1:09:50] predestinated
[1:09:52] seed be a prostitute on the
[1:09:56] walls of
[1:09:58] Jericho but she was a part of the lion
[1:10:01] of tribe of Judah let me do it with now
[1:10:04] if we could look at your
[1:10:07] lineage if we could look at your lineage
[1:10:10] and it looks
[1:10:12] so so
[1:10:14] lost and so
[1:10:16] destroyed and so wicked and God
[1:10:20] preserved your
[1:10:23] seed brother Roger Wicked shout about
[1:10:26] that today God preserved your natural
[1:10:32] seed Hebrews chap 11 and verse one now
[1:10:36] Faith is the
[1:10:38] substance of things hoped for the
[1:10:42] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[1:10:47] the elders obtained a good report stay
[1:10:50] with me through faith we understand that
[1:10:53] the worlds were framed by the world word
[1:10:55] of God so that things which are seen
[1:10:58] were made of things which do
[1:11:04] appear every one of you rode this
[1:11:08] morning on the word of
[1:11:14] God you planted your corn in the word of
[1:11:19] God you planted your tomatoes in the
[1:11:22] word of
[1:11:23] God this that you're living
[1:11:26] on God knew where he would place
[1:11:32] you and the enemy tells you God don't
[1:11:35] love you he put your chemicals sister
[1:11:40] Beth he put your chemicals exactly where
[1:11:44] your mother would eat your body out of
[1:11:47] the
[1:11:48] ground because the cursed Earth she
[1:11:52] would eat your body out of this cursed
[1:11:54] Earth
[1:11:55] brother BR said he would do it like a
[1:11:57] contractor laying out two before us and
[1:12:00] and all of the building grounds to build
[1:12:02] a house God knew where your body would
[1:12:05] be laying in the
[1:12:09] earth and if he could do that with a
[1:12:12] cursed Earth how much more can he do
[1:12:15] with a glorified
[1:12:19] sheep now here's what I want you to do I
[1:12:22] want you to look over at your neighbor

[1:17:44] one just keep praying just keep the
[1:17:49] victory you young guys don't know what
[1:17:51] I'm talking about there but you'll get
[1:17:53] there uh maybe not Psalms chapter 139
[1:17:58] for thou possesses verse 13 for thou
[1:18:01] possesses my
[1:18:03] reign thou has covered me in my womb my
[1:18:07] mother's
[1:18:08] womb I will praise thee for I am
[1:18:13] fearfully and wonderfully
[1:18:18] made David's talking about God's
[1:18:21] election for I am fearfully and
[1:18:24] wonderfully made marvelous are thy works
[1:18:29] that my soul knoweth right well notice
[1:18:34] this next verse my substance was not hid
[1:18:39] from thee when I was made in secret and
[1:18:42] curiously wrought in the lower parts of
[1:18:44] the earth Thine Eyes did see my
[1:18:49] substance yet being unperfect and in the
[1:18:53] book all my members were written which
[1:18:56] in the continuous were fashioned when as
[1:18:59] yet there was none of them now notice
[1:19:02] this next
[1:19:04] verse how precious also are thou
[1:19:07] thoughts unto me oh
[1:19:12] God how great is the sum of
[1:19:21] them I'm going to skip some things
[1:19:24] because I'm
[1:19:26] brother B would say
[1:19:27] this and each one of these God's Eternal
[1:19:33] thought expressed in its
[1:19:36] season then we come to Jesus the logos
[1:19:40] he was perfect and complete thought
[1:19:44] expressed and became known as the word
[1:19:49] that is what he
[1:19:51] is and forever
[1:19:54] will be notice what he said the express
[1:20:00] thought but he's not the only expressed
[1:20:04] thought can I carry it just a little bit
[1:20:07] farther now it says that he hath chosen
[1:20:11] Us in him before the foundational world
[1:20:15] that means that we were right there with
[1:20:17] him in the mind and the thoughts of God
[1:20:21] before the foundation of the world that
[1:20:23] gives an eternal quality to the
[1:20:26] elect you can't get away from
[1:20:31] it woo what a thought brother Matthew
[1:20:35] brother Andrew you may have two but
[1:20:37] brother Andrew quoted this last night
[1:20:39] and I think it's worth repeating and
[1:20:42] that's the person that the new life
[1:20:44] start starts from from this new birth
[1:20:49] and it builds another person in the
[1:20:51] image of this person that you are around
[1:20:54] that life he said you get it so
[1:20:57] potentially it's in
[1:21:00] hereen what is it the word promis before
[1:21:04] the foundation of the world and around
[1:21:06] there this only reflects the
[1:21:09] negative and this reflects the positive
[1:21:13] the word and the same there the thing
[1:21:16] that it is the translation of the Bible
[1:21:19] will be the same thing the word that's
[1:21:22] in you
[1:21:25] the body will materialize around that
[1:21:31] word the same thing that it did by
[1:21:37] Sarah notice how he puts that Sarah got
[1:21:41] a transformation of her
[1:21:44] body but that body had to die but that
[1:21:48] transformation of your body won't
[1:21:53] die Hallelujah
[1:21:57] hallelujah it's quite quite
[1:22:01] awesome before when that old body she
[1:22:05] had the first body it had to be changed
[1:22:08] in order to produce the Sun and this
[1:22:11] body cannot do it it'll have to be
[1:22:14] changed the same to receive the
[1:22:19] sun oh God I need a body
[1:22:22] change notice what he says he said let
[1:22:25] me inject a thought in here even our
[1:22:28] natural
[1:22:29] birth was based upon election I love
[1:22:32] what he does with this the female
[1:22:35] ovaries produce many many
[1:22:38] eggs by by why it is that a certain time
[1:22:42] a certain egg comes down and another not
[1:22:45] another one and then amongst that male
[1:22:48] sperm for no known reason a certain germ
[1:22:53] attaches itself to the egg While others
[1:22:56] that could have just as easily attached
[1:22:59] themsel or or or had a better
[1:23:02] opportunity to do so and did not do so
[1:23:05] and they
[1:23:08] perished you talking about one in a
[1:23:10] million there is an intelligence behind
[1:23:13] all of this and otherwise what
[1:23:16] determines whether the baby is a boy or
[1:23:19] a girl or blonde or brunette or light or
[1:23:23] dark type of
[1:23:25] eyes with these thoughts in mind think
[1:23:28] about Joshua and Caleb did not Jesus say
[1:23:31] in John your fathers did eat Mana in the
[1:23:34] wilderness and are
[1:23:37] dead those parents died and were
[1:23:41] necessary for the forefathers of the
[1:23:43] people to whom Jesus was speaking they
[1:23:49] perished and yet there were the election
[1:23:52] of God naturally as Joshua and Caleb
[1:23:58] were listen we announce babies being
[1:24:02] born we would like to
[1:24:04] congratulate Hunter and to and Katie
[1:24:09] they're having a
[1:24:11] baby but we don't have a
[1:24:14] funeral for over
[1:24:16] 900,000 germ Seeds of
[1:24:21] Life we don't have a funeral and say I'm
[1:24:24] so sorry that you didn't make it we
[1:24:27] could say the same thing about every one
[1:24:28] of
[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:31] you almost a million CS died while you
[1:24:36] lived did you catch that just right
[1:24:39] there if God could do that to get you
[1:24:42] here in your natural
[1:24:45] birth you ought to be shouting right now
[1:24:48] if God could do that to get you here in
[1:24:51] your natural birth
[1:24:54] and protect you in your natural birth
[1:24:57] how much
[1:25:01] more you say well God never did anything
[1:25:04] to get you
[1:25:06] here to get you
[1:25:10] here before the foundational world he
[1:25:13] bypassed a million to get you
[1:25:24] and any son is the attributes of his
[1:25:27] father and just as you were in the genes
[1:25:30] of your father and the body of your
[1:25:32] father when he was a young boy you were

[1:25:57] did when my father was acting up and
[1:26:00] being an ugly

[1:26:04] him let me take this a step further when
[1:26:08] my father was being an ugly boy you were
[1:26:11] in
[1:26:13] him and when my father was being an ugly
[1:26:17] boy you were in
[1:26:21] him and the children that you will
[1:26:23] produce
[1:26:25] they were in
[1:26:27] Charlie and before Charlie they were
[1:26:30] when Jesus was here your natural seed
[1:26:34] was being carried by somebody that's
[1:26:37] right in the
[1:26:42] earth Hallelujah and if God could watch
[1:26:45] over you all through this
[1:26:51] time are are you catching what I'm doing

[1:31:18] revealed himself in a pillar of fire
[1:31:21] brother Ron you mean that God caused
[1:31:24] my great great grandmother to fall in
[1:31:26] love with my great great
[1:31:28] grandfather and he may have had a nose

[1:31:34] long he may have been cross- sided as a
[1:31:39] bullfrog he may have stunk like a
[1:31:42] mule and your grandmother was a
[1:31:44] beautiful woman but there was something
[1:31:47] inside of that
[1:31:49] man there was something inside of that
[1:31:51] man that she fell in love with come on
[1:31:54] cuz God was causing them to Brother Ray
[1:31:58] I love this God was causing them to fall
[1:32:00] in love because he needed you to look
[1:32:03] like
[1:32:05] you cuz you're going to be the
[1:32:07] Tabernacle that he's going to live
[1:32:10] in but brother Ron I'm only 5 foot tall

[1:32:39] mother's 5 foot tall I'm thrilled to be
[1:32:42] 5'
[1:32:43] five
[1:32:50] yeah I was thinking about that when I
[1:32:53] was reaching for for richz crackers last
[1:32:55] night after
[1:33:00] service knowing that this was in my
[1:33:02] notes I didn't stand there and
[1:33:06] complain I went and got Connie's tools
[1:33:09] that she's got over there and those
[1:33:10] things that what do you call them things
[1:33:12] that
[1:33:13] you yeah you and you reach and you grab
[1:33:16] a hold gave me an extra foot and I
[1:33:18] reached up there and reached is that a
[1:33:20] word in the English language I reached
[1:33:22] up there and I grab those Rich crackers
[1:33:28] down Amen brother Josh you wouldn't have
[1:33:31] the problem but if you standing there i'
[1:33:33] say Josh could you reach and get them
[1:33:35] RIT
[1:33:37] crackers but there's times that I walk
[1:33:39] through a door I don't have to duck but
[1:33:41] he
[1:33:43] [Applause]
[1:33:50] does brother Josh I was I was uh
[1:33:54] in Canada this week and somebody walked
[1:33:57] up to me and said how tall is brother
[1:33:59] Josh I said I think he's probably 65
[1:34:04] 66 how much does he weigh I
[1:34:07] said that's above my pay

[1:34:12] grade brother Ron he made you look like
[1:34:14] a little bitty boy yes he does
[1:34:25] want
[1:34:27] some but God watched over my seed that I
[1:34:31] would be exactly this
[1:34:34] height so why should I complain about
[1:34:37] being 5 foot five and why should brother
[1:34:40] Josh complained about being
[1:34:42] 65 God made us fearfully and wonderfully
[1:34:49] made now this is especially for you guys

[1:35:52] 10-year-old May is
[1:35:54] am I right am I close am I on
[1:35:58] target so God watches over your natural
[1:36:02] seat come on help me preach now I've
[1:36:05] been carnal for a minute to get your
[1:36:07] thoughts where you need to
[1:36:10] be listen God knows how to make you the
[1:36:14] way you
[1:36:16] are are you with me so simply wait on
[1:36:20] God
[1:36:27] Abraham was
[1:36:32] childless Sarah was
[1:36:38] childless no
[1:36:41] children but they did not understand the
[1:36:44] potential that was laying inside of them
[1:36:47] that's right and they were praying for a
[1:36:52] child
[1:36:54] they were
[1:36:57] desperate and God spoke to them you're
[1:37:00] going to have a child you're going to
[1:37:02] have a son through
[1:37:06] Sarah now let me just say this to you if
[1:37:09] you were in that boat you're
[1:37:12] looking maybe at the natural so God's
[1:37:16] got to have a sermon by brother Ron to
[1:37:19] tell you quit looking at the
[1:37:22] natural so he takes you to the sand of
[1:37:26] the sea and he said Abraham can you
[1:37:30] count
[1:37:32] them now you that go to a beach let me
[1:37:36] just remind you what Abraham was looking
[1:37:38] at can you count the sand particles on
[1:37:42] just the beach that you're
[1:37:46] standing now I'm going to take you
[1:37:48] further than that what about every beach
[1:37:50] in the world can you count the sand part
[1:37:53] articles on every one of
[1:37:56] them it must have blowed his mind so
[1:38:00] shall thy seed
[1:38:08] B go ahead and steal that that that's a
[1:38:11] good
[1:38:13] one one night it's a very
[1:38:16] clear I like really clear
[1:38:19] nights where there's no pollution or no
[1:38:23] fog or no clouds and you get to a high
[1:38:28] place where you can't see the the great
[1:38:30] big lights of
[1:38:34] Gros and you're looking into the night
[1:38:37] it looks like you could see all the
[1:38:39] stars well you're not you're not even
[1:38:42] seeing you're not hardly seeing a a
[1:38:45] quarter of
[1:38:46] them and God says
[1:38:50] Abraham can you count the Stars
[1:38:54] of the
[1:39:01] heaven and they're only what he can
[1:39:06] see so shall thy seat
[1:39:15] be here's where I want to come to
[1:39:24] we're going to spend eternity
[1:39:32] together we're going to spend eternity
[1:39:34] together I want you to look at your
[1:39:36] neighbor say we're going to spend
[1:39:37] eternity
[1:39:44] together now that's more sister Beth
[1:39:47] that's more than six hours a week
[1:39:55] and what Abraham was looking at is going
[1:39:58] to be
[1:40:03] there and more than just what he looked
[1:40:05] up
[1:40:07] at we're going to be
[1:40:09] there I was one of those particles of
[1:40:14] sand or one of those stars that were in
[1:40:17] the heaven I was one of them I could not
[1:40:21] be displayed in Jesus's hour Paul's hour
[1:40:25] you get the point but I had to be
[1:40:27] manifested in this
[1:40:30] hour I had to be manifested in this hour
[1:40:35] and so
[1:40:37] God pre-plans you
[1:40:42] yes pre-planned you to be born in this
[1:40:49] day cuz he needed you maybe to not go
[1:40:53] down in faith and by death but he needed
[1:40:58] somebody that would believe this message
[1:41:01] so
[1:41:03] much come on are you with me let me just
[1:41:06] go further a little bit further God W
[1:41:09] watched over Samson's birth you can
[1:41:12] trace it through the scripture God
[1:41:14] watched over Samuel's birth he watched
[1:41:17] over Moses's birth let me spend a minute
[1:41:20] right here remember this when they put
[1:41:23] him in that in that crocodile infested
[1:41:27] water in that in that bull rush they put
[1:41:31] him in a basket put tar on the bottom of
[1:41:33] it covered it up some way they couldn't
[1:41:36] see the angels of God watching
[1:41:41] over they couldn't see Gabriel stand on
[1:41:45] top of that on top of that
[1:41:49] basket I'm not going to be much longer
[1:41:51] now they couldn't
[1:41:54] see Gabriel standing there and thousands
[1:41:58] of angels watching over but a prophet of
[1:42:02] God in this day could look back and pick
[1:42:05] it out of the
[1:42:06] scriptures and hear the instructions of
[1:42:11] God hear the instructions of God say
[1:42:14] Gabriel stand on that
[1:42:16] Ark and every time a crocodile comes up
[1:42:20] and tries to bite it you push your foot
[1:42:23] down down on him and push it
[1:42:25] away and when he starts getting in whirl
[1:42:28] pools listen get him out of the whirl
[1:42:30] pools of
[1:42:32] Life brother Ron that was Moses what
[1:42:35] about
[1:42:37] you you've never been alone whether you
[1:42:40] was in school whether you was in
[1:42:43] colleg where you was alone on your job
[1:42:48] angels have been dispatched
[1:42:53] oh because of what's deposited in your
[1:43:01] seed brother Ron do you mean when an was
[1:43:04] so crazy over Elis
[1:43:08] Presley and climbing a tree to see if
[1:43:11] she could see him do you mean that God
[1:43:14] was watching over her listen angels have
[1:43:16] went a lot of Dark Places
[1:43:23] David when you was going places that you
[1:43:26] wouldn't even want to tell children
[1:43:27] about the angels of God was watching
[1:43:30] over
[1:43:31] you when you guys were dumpster diving
[1:43:35] the angels of God was watching up
[1:43:37] brother Jim when you was in the Navy the
[1:43:39] angels of God was watching over
[1:43:41] you not because of you but because of
[1:43:44] that predestinated seed
[1:43:53] preach brother

[1:44:18] children God had his
[1:44:21] name Hallelujah
[1:44:24] amen you cried you prayed I remember
[1:44:27] those days you thought it would never
[1:44:30] happen but there was a vision given to

[1:44:35] child going to be a

[1:45:04] knows when he showed me the vision of
[1:45:08] Isaac being born the way that he was
[1:45:10] born when it was
[1:45:12] impossible and then Here Comes Zoe along
[1:45:16] all
[1:45:18] sass God needed her not to speak
[1:45:25] cuz she needed to
[1:45:27] live the first couple years of her life
[1:45:30] but when it seemed like she wasn't going
[1:45:32] to get better God came on the sun and
[1:45:36] loosed her
[1:45:46] tongue brother Ron this seems really far
[1:45:49] out we serve the god
[1:45:53] that can look at an apple seed and tell

[1:47:59] got to find a
[1:48:03] seat and that seat keeps
[1:48:09] moving so and I'm ending

[1:48:34] great in his architect until walking up
[1:48:38] that mountain you'll feel like you're
[1:48:40] walking on flat
[1:48:43] ground and he would describe that your
[1:48:45] piece of property had the River of Life
[1:48:48] flowing through
[1:48:50] it amen
[1:48:53] and he said there's going to be
[1:48:55] parks and
[1:48:58] avenues streets of gold walls of

[1:49:06] of the city because he lights it all up

[1:50:42] think in our
[1:50:44] mortality and it's hard for us to think
[1:50:47] in the Eternal
[1:50:50] realm if God could think of you
[1:50:53] in the Eternal realm and you look at it
[1:50:56] in Mortal realm and you build a house
[1:50:59] but God builds it much
[1:51:02] differently you say well brother Ron how

[1:52:05] like jumping to the
[1:52:07] Moon in that Eternal
[1:52:10] realm where the lamb is the light and he
[1:52:13] fixes
[1:52:16] everything these hands will look
