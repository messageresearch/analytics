[1:10:14] he's bringing his home we come up the
[1:10:19] hill this afternoon we realized that we
[1:10:22] didn't come for the attraction of a man
[1:10:24] [Music]
[1:10:27] as a matter of fact we didn't even come
[1:10:29] to see a man
[1:10:31] we come to see him
[1:10:34] [Music]
[1:10:35] I would think that there's not sporting
[1:10:38] events that would come with this kind of
[1:10:40] expectations not the biggest churches
[1:10:45] the world would come with the power
[1:10:47] that's in this building but the bride of
[1:10:52] Jesus Christ that was with him before
[1:10:54] the foundation of the world have
[1:10:56] gathered in the moments before rapture
[1:11:00] and there's an expectation here tonight
[1:11:04] because we're for a homecoming for a
[1:11:08] long going hallelujah I don't know what
[1:11:13] you came forwards or not even what your
[1:11:14] need is but I know this that God can
[1:11:22] rebuild the shoulder while a sermon is
[1:11:25] being preached he can re heal lungs and
[1:11:34] restore them to a hundred percent while
[1:11:36] a sermon is being preached but greater
[1:11:41] than all that he can transform your life
[1:11:48] [Applause]
[1:12:01] I don't know what your need is but the
[1:12:08] Lord Jesus just allow the holy spirit to
[1:12:10] flutter across this audience tonight and
[1:12:14] you reach out and touch him while he
[1:12:16] goes by hallelujah I'm praying not only
[1:12:23] that God would touch you but would
[1:12:29] supernaturally healed the speaker
[1:12:31] tonight I believe God can do that I
[1:12:36] believe it can supernaturally heal even
[1:12:39] the speaker hallelujah
[1:12:47] we have felt LED of the Lord to be
[1:12:50] standing in this body and I believe that
[1:12:53] this is a predestinated moment last
[1:12:58] night we heard the man of God speak
[1:13:01] blessed are they that are hungry they
[1:13:04] shall be filled
[1:13:07] identify as one of those that's very
[1:13:10] hungry in this hour and God it's given

[1:18:03] five and verse two so appreciated the
[1:18:07] word the Lord last night and we're
[1:18:11] hungry and we shall be filled a man I
[1:18:15] believe that God has something for us
[1:18:17] and then his promises are true a man and
[1:18:21] he has this the food that we new need to
[1:18:24] in due season Joshua chapter five and
[1:18:27] verse two we're going to just pick up
[1:18:30] where you left off last night brother
[1:18:32] Wayne Amen at that time the Lord said
[1:18:36] unto Joshua make these sharp knives and
[1:18:39] circumcise again to children of Israel
[1:18:42] the second time and Joshua made him
[1:18:45] sharp knives and circumcise the children
[1:18:47] of Israel at the heel of the foreskins
[1:18:50] and this is the cause why Joshua did
[1:18:55] circumcise all the people that came out
[1:18:58] of Egypt that were males even all the
[1:19:00] men of war died in the wilderness by the
[1:19:02] way after they came out of Egypt now all
[1:19:05] the people that came out were
[1:19:07] circumcised but all the people that were
[1:19:09] born in the wilderness by the way as
[1:19:11] they came forth out of Egypt them they
[1:19:15] had not circumcised for the children of
[1:19:18] Israel walked forty years in the
[1:19:20] wilderness till all the people that were
[1:19:22] men of war which came out of Egypt were
[1:19:26] consumed because they obeyed not the
[1:19:28] voice of the Lord and to whom the Lord
[1:19:31] swear that he would not show them the
[1:19:33] lamb which the Lord swear unto their
[1:19:36] fathers that he would give us a land
[1:19:38] that floweth with milk in
[1:19:40] honey and their children whom he had
[1:19:42] raised up in their stead them Joshua
[1:19:46] circumcised for they were uncircumcised
[1:19:49] because they had not circumcised them by
[1:19:51] the way and it came to pass and when
[1:19:56] they had done circumcise in all the
[1:19:58] people that they abode in their places
[1:20:01] till they were home and the Lord said
[1:20:05] unto Joshua this day have I rolled away
[1:20:08] the reproach of Egypt from you give me
[1:20:13] verse 10 if you will please there and
[1:20:16] the children of Israel encamped in
[1:20:18] Gilgal and kept the Passover on the
[1:20:22] fourteenth day of the month even in the
[1:20:25] plains of Jericho verse 11 and they did
[1:20:29] eat of the old corn of the land on the
[1:20:31] morrow after the Passover unleavened
[1:20:33] cakes and parts corn in the self-same

[1:21:55] to us I just wanted to make mention you
[1:21:58] know we saw just a little bit of the
[1:22:00] discernment line at the beginning of the

[1:22:21] church service hit you know it's old
[1:22:24] impacted in my life and I had a dear
[1:22:28] friend of mine at that time that was a
[1:22:31] close friend brother George liquors who
[1:22:35] went on to be with the Lord in a
[1:22:37] situation back in 1980 but in this time
[1:22:42] he had a young daughter and every time
[1:22:45] they would you know as they visited us
[1:22:47] in our home this baby had a an able
[1:22:52] ruptured navel that stuck out about like
[1:22:55] this and the mother is a little bit
[1:22:57] embarrassed by it and would sit holding
[1:22:59] the baby by the stomach like this and
[1:23:03] would hold that navel in but every time
[1:23:06] she moved her hand it would
[1:23:09] pop back out again and they showed this
[1:23:15] brother and his family were from Alabama
[1:23:17] and they showed us this film that he
[1:23:20] called us to the deep in their church

[1:27:20] a walker and painfully struggled to the
[1:27:24] refrigerator or somewhere there to to

[1:27:30] and scooted the mug around the kitchen

[1:28:04] back to his chair and he was praying as
[1:28:07] he went and reaching the chair he sat
[1:28:10] down and and finished his prayer and
[1:28:13] said a man and reached to get a drink of
[1:28:17] the tea or whatever he had got in the
[1:28:20] phone rang and I was in my barn during

[1:28:38] spoke to me and told me to say these
[1:28:40] words to you I love you
[1:28:53] brother Kenneth begins shouting he had a
[1:28:56] revival filled with assurance that God
[1:28:59] indeed did love him amen now that was
[1:29:02] quite some years ago he's much older now
[1:29:04] been through a lot and yet he still
[1:29:06] continues with an unfailing faith and
[1:29:09] the love of God life hasn't been easy
[1:29:11] for him
[1:29:12] he's had done 30 stents in his heart six
[1:29:16] balloon procedures several heart attacks
[1:29:19] his heart was only operating thirty to
[1:29:21] thirty-five percent plus he's been
[1:29:24] fighting cancer in his body for the past
[1:29:26] several years it was last just before
[1:29:31] our fall meetings that your pastor
[1:29:34] brother Ron comes to and ministered to
[1:29:36] us he was on his deathbed and the doctor
[1:29:40] called her the family in and told him
[1:29:42] this is it and I was preaching on the
[1:29:46] the power of the sons of God and and
[1:29:50] being adopted as sons of God knowing our
[1:29:53] position in Christ and speak in the word
[1:29:56] I walked in there in that hospital with
[1:29:58] the ministry from the church and I said
[1:30:00] now brother Kenneth it's time for you
[1:30:02] just to ask what you will and gotta give
[1:30:05] it to you he said well I want to be in
[1:30:08] church on Wednesday night I don't want
[1:30:10] to miss the meetings that man who is
[1:30:15] death warmed over and got up out of that
[1:30:18] bed was at the meetings a whole meetings
[1:30:28] yeah Exodus the hospital room that day
[1:30:31] he said I'll be in church Wednesday
[1:30:34] night see you there
[1:30:36] and so you know it was four months ago
[1:30:38] now that the doctor said he had cancer
[1:30:40] in the blood it's leukemia lymphoma and
[1:30:43] it is spread through one-third of his
[1:30:45] bones and the lymph nodes and his
[1:30:47] stomach was so large his stomach has
[1:30:49] split you know just swelled way out and
[1:30:51] the doctors said they could burst any
[1:30:55] minute and he had cancer over and over
[1:30:58] I'm 50% of his body they estimated and
[1:31:02] put him on a small pill to boost his
[1:31:03] immune system but he's had no chemo or
[1:31:05] radiation they couldn't do that because
[1:31:09] of his heart condition two weeks ago now
[1:31:11] we have a doctor's visit and the doctor
[1:31:15] came in the exam room he came in smile
[1:31:18] and said let me shake the hand of an off
[1:31:20] some man and he said wow wow wow he said
[1:31:23] the blood work showed there's no cancer
[1:31:37] not fully comprehending the news he he
[1:31:41] asks the doctor again about the cancer
[1:31:43] and the doctor said what cancer there is
[1:31:46] no cancer is gone
[1:31:48] and I just can't explain it but your
[1:31:50] lymph nodes is normal your blood work is
[1:31:52] normal and furthermore he said that
[1:31:56] we've done an examination on your heart
[1:31:58] and it's a muscle and it never
[1:32:00] rejuvenates or restores itself but he
[1:32:03] said my examination shows your heart is
[1:32:05] now operating perfectly I can't explain
[1:32:07] it this just don't happen
[1:32:20] hallelujah hallelujah amen you can
[1:32:25] expect the impossible because there's
[1:32:28] nothing impossible with you whatever you
[1:32:31] say a man is in your mouth you confess
[1:32:34] what God's Word said that song that was
[1:32:39] sung a moment ago it means a lot to me I
[1:32:42] guess I have played it over and over and
[1:32:45] over I believe we ever arrive back to
[1:32:49] the homeland of the Bible and so that's
[1:32:52] our homeland after a dispara of the 2000
[1:32:57] years where the church drifted away from
[1:33:00] the original word that was given at
[1:33:04] Pentecost in that in the by the Apostle
[1:33:07] Paul as a word was revealed I believe we
[1:33:11] are now in the midst of the fulfillment
[1:33:13] of Scripture it's a very wonderful hour
[1:33:17] that we're in and as I read to you a
[1:33:20] moment ago I believe that it is time for
[1:33:24] a recession as we have entered back into
[1:33:30] that homeland that all of the
[1:33:33] generations that has not been
[1:33:35] circumcised filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:33:38] it's time to be filled with the Holy
[1:33:41] Ghost get the world cut off of you
[1:33:44] amen so we're here but we have returned
[1:33:48] here to our homeland to see the Messiah
[1:33:52] that's why we have come we have come to
[1:33:56] see the return of Christ not to
[1:33:58] perpetuate the ages not to break over
[1:34:01] into another Church age with the need of
[1:34:03] a new messenger but we we have come to
[1:34:07] the fulfillment of Scripture we're right
[1:34:11] here at the fact the winding up of the
[1:34:13] Gentile dispensation
[1:34:15] I believe we're so nearer that I believe
[1:34:18] that even those witnesses that will be
[1:34:21] going to the Jews Moses and Elijah
[1:34:23] already here a man I believe they're
[1:34:27] already born I believe they're already
[1:34:29] here
[1:34:30] oh man they have to be for us to leave
[1:34:33] they have to be ready to step in their
[1:34:36] ministry they're just waiting on their
[1:34:38] Commission maybe they're you've gotten
[1:34:40] misunderstood ways and don't understand
[1:34:43] about their mysterious life that God
[1:34:49] revealed it to him in his time a
[1:34:51] mountain we Everest we are here to see
[1:34:54] the Messiah dome we have received the
[1:34:57] message of the exodus and let me wow
[1:35:01] while I got you ruffled just a little
[1:35:04] bit about those Jews and those are Moses
[1:35:07] and Elijah I don't think I'm one of them
[1:35:11] I'm leaving here before they come on the
[1:35:15] scene and they won't be a Gentile
[1:35:23] there'll be a Jew so you can you just go
[1:35:26] ahead and put your my lighter mantle
[1:35:28] down and you know your Moses rod and you
[1:35:31] know because the next the next move of
[1:35:35] God after we leave here is to Israel a
[1:35:37] man and you know if you're left behind
[1:35:40] and you're not an Israelite or Jewish
[1:35:43] person you you're gonna miss it because
[1:35:47] there won't be another Gentile saved
[1:35:51] amen
[1:35:52] now I'm gonna read my real scripture
[1:35:56] Exodus chapter 12 and verse 1 is where
[1:36:00] we're going to be focusing a bone
[1:36:03] tonight as we look into this as you've
[1:36:08] seen the scene in Joshua as they entered
[1:36:12] into the land that came back into the
[1:36:14] Passover we're going to read in Exodus
[1:36:18] chapter 12 and verse 1 and the Lord
[1:36:21] spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land
[1:36:23] of Egypt saying this month shall be unto
[1:36:26] you the beginning a month it shall be
[1:36:30] the first month of the year to you
[1:36:32] speaking to all the children of Israel
[1:36:34] sayin in the tenth day of this month
[1:36:36] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[1:36:39] according to the house of their fathers
[1:36:42] alive
[1:36:43] for a house and if the household be too
[1:36:46] little for the lamb let him in his
[1:36:48] neighbor next to you under his house
[1:36:50] take it according to the number of the
[1:36:52] souls and every man according to his
[1:36:54] eating shall make your count for the
[1:36:56] lamb your lamb shall be without blemish
[1:37:00] a male of the first year and you shall
[1:37:03] take it out from the Sheep or from the
[1:37:06] goats and you shall keep it up until the
[1:37:09] fourteenth day of the same month and the
[1:37:12] whole Assembly of the congregation of
[1:37:15] Israel shall kill it in the evening and
[1:37:18] they shall take the blood and strike it
[1:37:20] on the two side posts and on the upper
[1:37:24] doorpost of the houses wherein they
[1:37:27] shall eat it three places where the
[1:37:30] blood must be applied and they shall eat

[1:37:37] fire and unleavened bread and with
[1:37:39] bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not
[1:37:42] of it wrong not sudden at all with water

[1:37:52] shall let nothing of it remain until the
[1:37:54] morning and that which remaineth of it
[1:37:58] unto the morning you shall burn with
[1:37:59] fire and thus shall you eat it with your
[1:38:03] loins girded your shoes on your feet and
[1:38:06] your staff in your hand and you shall
[1:38:09] eat in haste it is the Lord's Passover
[1:38:12] for I will pass through the land of
[1:38:15] Egypt this night and will smite all the
[1:38:17] firstborn in the land of Egypt both man
[1:38:20] and beast and against all the gods of
[1:38:24] Egypt I will execute judgment I am the
[1:38:28] Lord and the blood shall be to you for a
[1:38:31] token among the houses where you are and
[1:38:34] when I see the Blood I will pass over
[1:38:37] you and the plague shall not be upon you
[1:38:40] to destroy you when I smite the land of
[1:38:44] Egypt and this day shall be unto you for
[1:38:48] memorial and you shall keep it a feast
[1:38:51] to the Lord throughout your generations
[1:38:54] you shall keep it a
[1:38:56] Feast by an ordinance forever then turn
[1:39:01] with me to numbers chapter 33 will read
[1:39:04] from the third verse and they departed
[1:39:06] from ramiz's in the first month on the
[1:39:09] fifteenth day of the first month on the
[1:39:12] morrow after the Passover the children
[1:39:14] of Israel went out with a high hand that
[1:39:17] means it went out triumphantly in the
[1:39:20] sight of all the Egyptians for the
[1:39:23] Egyptians buried all their firstborn
[1:39:25] which the Lord had smitten among them
[1:39:29] upon their gods also the Lord executed
[1:39:34] judgments wherein the day in an hour
[1:39:39] where the Death Angel is certainly in
[1:39:41] the land as brother Wayne was preaching
[1:39:46] last night about the four horse riders
[1:39:49] and you know his poise right now the
[1:39:52] rider is already here he's already he's
[1:39:56] always been there it's been a wider red
[1:39:58] and a black but now it melts together
[1:40:00] into one and the same rider now has been
[1:40:04] identified by the Eagle anointing his
[1:40:06] death you hadn't started his full ride
[1:40:09] as in unleashed in his full power yet
[1:40:12] and he will not until the brightest
[1:40:14] leaves from here and goes in a rapture
[1:40:17] but we're already seeing three
[1:40:19] tribulation plagues coming up on the
[1:40:21] earth we're already seeing the insanity
[1:40:25] that is coming upon the world today as a
[1:40:28] death angel is in the land and brother
[1:40:32] Branham would tell us as he preached the
[1:40:34] message after the token desperations and
[1:40:37] he would kind of demonstrate it like you
[1:40:40] know I would imagine the children when
[1:40:42] they saw those big black wings drop down
[1:40:47] from the sky like a smoke settling over
[1:40:49] the city and the screams coming from
[1:40:52] every house and the children might have
[1:40:54] went to their daddy and said daddy are
[1:40:57] you sure we're under that token and he
[1:41:01] could go to that door and look upon the
[1:41:03] posts a little and say son
[1:41:05] according to the word I am positive
[1:41:10] that's according to what the Prophet
[1:41:12] told us and he has the word of the Lord
[1:41:16] said when I see the blood I'll pass over
[1:41:20] you take a lamb for the house and I
[1:41:23] brought all you children in you're my
[1:41:25] oldest but my firstborn and that's the
[1:41:28] one that's dying that's all dying out
[1:41:30] there but there is the blood that's what
[1:41:34] thus saith the lord was surest my son
[1:41:38] rest at ease because god made the
[1:41:42] promise you say well daddy but why do
[1:41:45] you got your shoes on and why you got
[1:41:47] your staff in your hand and why you got
[1:41:49] that piece of bread and one end and a
[1:41:52] lamb in the other hand why isn't bitter
[1:41:56] herbs and things what are you eating it
[1:41:59] what is a sweat running off of your face
[1:42:01] about son death is about to strike so it
[1:42:06] was a time of desperation I want you to
[1:42:10] know we are in a very desperate hour
[1:42:13] that sin that abides on every side
[1:42:16] there's every kind of evil that is
[1:42:18] coming in I'm on there things are
[1:42:21] getting darker in fact the prophet of
[1:42:23] God will not be able to allow to see our
[1:42:26] day he said I can't see past nineteen
[1:42:29] seventy seven it got so dark and we are
[1:42:32] now advanced many years into the hour of
[1:42:34] darkness well is so dark a prophet
[1:42:37] couldn't see beyond that date are you
[1:42:40] with me now but let me tell you we have
[1:42:43] heard the prophets and what his
[1:42:45] instructions are listen Exodus 12 22 and
[1:42:50] ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip
[1:42:53] it in the blood that is in the basin and
[1:42:57] strike the lentil and the to Cyprus with
[1:43:00] the blood that is in the basin and none
[1:43:03] of you shall go out of the door of his
[1:43:06] house until the morning listen they were
[1:43:10] instructed to stay behind that blood
[1:43:14] amen until the trumpet sound and we
[1:43:19] ought to stay behind the blood we are to
[1:43:21] stay there behind the working of the
[1:43:25] Holy Spirit the blood of Christ are you
[1:43:28] with me a man until the trumpet sounds
[1:43:32] notice as we look at this brother band
[1:43:36] said in the token the Israel was
[1:43:38] commanded Australia under that blood
[1:43:40] until the marching orders come don't go
[1:43:44] out from under it once under that token
[1:43:47] they were sealed in there don't leave
[1:43:49] that they were stayed right there until
[1:43:52] the midnight struck and the trumpets
[1:43:55] blowed and when the trumpets blowed the
[1:43:58] old ram's horns began to blow and each
[1:44:01] one marched out with his provision going
[1:44:03] to the promised land now Paul would tell
[1:44:08] us that he would tell us that Christ is
[1:44:12] our Passover lamb that we also are to
[1:44:15] have a Passover in 1st Corinthians 5 and
[1:44:19] 6 he said no you're not a little leaven
[1:44:21] leaveneth the whole lump purge out
[1:44:24] therefore the old leaven that you may be
[1:44:26] a new lump as you are unleavened for
[1:44:30] even Christ our Passover notice his word
[1:44:33] Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us
[1:44:37] therefore let us keep the feasts
[1:44:40] noticing where let us keep the feast not
[1:44:43] with old leaven neither with leaven of
[1:44:47] malice and wickedness but with the
[1:44:49] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[1:44:53] so you see you know Paul is teaching us
[1:44:57] that we are continually keeping a feast
[1:45:01] in other words we are constantly in
[1:45:05] Passover that's what we're going to
[1:45:08] speak tonight in the Passover every day
[1:45:12] for taking of Christ I RAM and man with
[1:45:16] the unleavened bread of sincerity and
[1:45:19] truth
[1:45:20] you must keep this feast communing with
[1:45:24] Christ not only of truth but also with
[1:45:28] sincerity and Magnum brother branham
[1:45:31] would see a vision about in turn back
[1:45:34] into the promised land and he said it
[1:45:36] was a great highway that he saw as they
[1:45:39] were going down this highway but he said
[1:45:42] he noticed everybody on the highway was
[1:45:44] afraid and he said you know I wonder
[1:45:48] what is everybody afraid about and the
[1:45:51] boys came back and said there's such
[1:45:53] danger in these days there's a great
[1:45:56] hideous thing that his death when his
[1:45:59] traction hey man and we're living in
[1:46:03] that day where there's a Death Angel in
[1:46:05] the land and you must be under a token
[1:46:10] are you with me he would see it there he
[1:46:13] would see they saw him take after a
[1:46:16] friend of his and he was just one jump
[1:46:18] ahead of him running from him running
[1:46:21] for his life and the thing was about to
[1:46:24] get him he screamed out Oh God
[1:46:26] don't let it get my brother and it
[1:46:27] turned toward him and he said the closer
[1:46:29] it got to him the slower it become until
[1:46:33] it had to stop something was holding it
[1:46:35] off I don't know what you want but
[1:46:39] that's the way I want to be I want to be
[1:46:42] in such a place in a position with God
[1:46:45] with the death angel comes my way and
[1:46:48] he's coming he's coming in all kinds of
[1:46:50] form every kind of sin imaginable or
[1:46:54] unimaginable he is coming in every kinda
[1:46:57] way creeping right into our homes coming
[1:47:00] into our churches a man coming in the
[1:47:04] lives of what was would seemingly be
[1:47:07] stomped Saints for many many years but
[1:47:10] I'll tell you when he hates for me I
[1:47:12] want something I want to know there's a
[1:47:14] power that holds him off that he cannot
[1:47:19] reach to me are you with me and looking
[1:47:23] back we can see where the serpent has
[1:47:26] been
[1:47:27] SURS that yusuf said on our platform
[1:47:30] Deacon's that used to serve in our
[1:47:33] churches among trustees and many many
[1:47:36] young people even what seemed to be
[1:47:39] stalwart Saints that have fallen away
[1:47:42] they haven't been bit by the death angel
[1:47:46] hey man oh yeah we can see at them but
[1:47:50] brother I wanna I want us to be able to
[1:47:52] bind that Mamba that snake the one that
[1:47:57] if you bind you can bind everything
[1:47:59] beneath him are you with me he said if
[1:48:04] you can bind this one you can bind
[1:48:06] everything beneath him
[1:48:09] and I believe that we are people there
[1:48:13] is a people in the land that will bind
[1:48:15] the serpent of Jack and be changed in a
[1:48:19] moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:48:22] hallelujah and if you can bind up when
[1:48:25] you can bind everything beneath him and
[1:48:30] a voice came to me from above he said
[1:48:32] you've been given the power to bind him
[1:48:34] the worst are any and I want you to know
[1:48:38] that's not just something given to one
[1:48:40] man a man went away wait a minute you
[1:48:44] know we get into some problems here a
[1:48:47] lot of times but when Moses got the 10
[1:48:49] commandments that was his real getting
[1:48:51] the Ten Commandments a man when he got a
[1:48:55] message from God that was Israel getting
[1:48:58] a message from God when brother Branham
[1:49:00] received a sword in his hand that was
[1:49:02] you getting a sword in your hand when a
[1:49:05] message come in this day is not William
[1:49:07] branham's message it's your message
[1:49:09] [Applause]
[1:49:14] you've been given power to bind him the
[1:49:17] worst or any and he said well God what
[1:49:20] must I do he said there's one thing you
[1:49:23] must do you must be more sincere so well
[1:49:29] God forgive me for my insincerity
[1:49:34] and let me have sincerity a man and he's
[1:49:39] said when I raised up my hands to him
[1:49:41] again there was a great something came
[1:49:44] over me and just lifted up me up and
[1:49:46] seemed like that my whole body was
[1:49:49] charged with something hallelujah don't
[1:49:54] you want to be that way
[1:49:55] i mandated that you if you've come into
[1:49:59] a greater sincerity in your life until
[1:50:02] your whole being is just charged with
[1:50:06] satin something that can bind the power
[1:50:10] of the serpent it's passed to him that
[1:50:14] all leaven is purged and we come to a
[1:50:17] greater sincerity now we often think a
[1:50:20] Passover as a meal that you know it's
[1:50:23] served kind of like Thanksgiving Day you
[1:50:27] know for us as Americans meal that lasts
[1:50:30] all day you know how it is you so you
[1:50:32] get the table spread and you eat it and
[1:50:35] then you eat on it all day and you know
[1:50:39] but Paul says our Passover is Christ and
[1:50:44] if we're in Christ then each day we are
[1:50:49] keeping the feast amen you are to be in
[1:50:56] Passover from the moment you get the
[1:50:58] Holy Ghost amen the blood applied with
[1:51:01] his three stripes come on now Amen the
[1:51:05] blood applied upon your body upon your
[1:51:08] spirit and upon your soul and you are to
[1:51:11] be in Passover until the call comes to
[1:51:14] cut out for the Exodus until the trumpet
[1:51:18] sounds you are to be in Passover you're
[1:51:23] to be in fellowship in communion with
[1:51:27] Christ now until the trumpet sounds you
[1:51:31] must stay behind the blood of the Lamb
[1:51:35] feeding on the Passover meal and then
[1:51:38] making ready to leave for you're going
[1:51:41] to be in Passover until the day you
[1:51:43] leave from here hey man now so death was
[1:51:48] in the land and we
[1:51:50] must have the token displayed with every
[1:51:53] within every aspect of our lives and all
[1:51:57] the leaven of sin removed I'm under sue
[1:52:02] and this is a manifestation that you're
[1:52:04] looking for and brother Branham said
[1:52:06] there's something that takes place in
[1:52:08] you see there's something that changes
[1:52:11] you your whole system your old spiritual
[1:52:15] system it's made new again and you
[1:52:17] become a new creature in Christ as the
[1:52:20] Bible puts it a new creation hey man now
[1:52:25] did you notice did you notice in the
[1:52:28] scripture that we were reading the
[1:52:30] israelites were to go out and they were
[1:52:33] not to go out anymore after the token of
[1:52:36] the blood the Holy Ghost is applied and
[1:52:40] not only do you not go out but the death
[1:52:43] angel can't get in hallelujah amen you
[1:52:49] don't go out and he can't get in there's
[1:52:52] a blood that holds him off
[1:52:58] there's a power that keeps you now or a
[1:53:02] tribulation or trouble are you with me
[1:53:05] or great sorrow or whatever you go
[1:53:07] through in your life there's a power
[1:53:09] there are blood hallelujah there is a
[1:53:13] blood and that blood is a seal in your
[1:53:18] distain behind that bladder Colossians
[1:53:25] three and three said for your dead to
[1:53:27] sin and your life is hid with Christ in
[1:53:29] God brother Branham would often say when
[1:53:33] he would quote that scripture sealed by
[1:53:36] the Holy Ghost i man in Israel in the
[1:53:39] church he said I'm glad to say as Paul
[1:53:42] of all before the king in the way that
[1:53:45] is called heresy so worship I the god of
[1:53:48] our fathers
[1:53:49] hallelujah heresy crazy foolishness unto
[1:53:53] the world but glorious to them that are
[1:53:55] in Christ and joy dead hallelujah yes
[1:53:59] sir hid away in Christ said well the
[1:54:01] devil come and got me no he never you
[1:54:04] went out to him the Bible said you're
[1:54:07] dead in your life is hid in God through
[1:54:10] Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost how
[1:54:13] could the devil get to you you went out
[1:54:15] that's right devil never got to you it's
[1:54:19] like it was in the days of Noah when
[1:54:22] God's at the door are you with me and
[1:54:25] when judgment waters couldn't come in
[1:54:27] and they couldn't get out and I'll tell
[1:54:30] you there is a seal of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:32] a man that have sealed you behind that
[1:54:36] blood where you're safe and you're
[1:54:39] secure hallelujah but you gotta stay in
[1:54:44] the house behind the blood and brother
[1:54:48] Brennan would say in hidden life with
[1:54:49] crises and that's what the church needs
[1:54:51] today is a hidden consecrated life you
[1:54:55] can't be Dibble Dallin around along with
[1:54:57] the world and impersonating acting like
[1:54:59] them and hid with Christ because you're
[1:55:01] trying to find
[1:55:02] of the world you're trying to live like
[1:55:05] the next Church you're trying to belong
[1:55:07] to a better organization or wear better
[1:55:09] clothes or do so and so that's that's
[1:55:11] not comply with Christianity
[1:55:13] Christianity is a sanctified life hidden
[1:55:17] life with God through Christ sealed by
[1:55:19] the Holy Ghost that's what the real
[1:55:22] Christian life consists of not how well
[1:55:25] you can do this sir how well you can
[1:55:27] sing
[1:55:28] that's alright how well you can preach
[1:55:30] that's fine but that isn't it it's a
[1:55:33] hidden life consecrated the Veil the
[1:55:36] curtains wrapped around you and you're
[1:55:39] dead and you're buried and you're hidden
[1:55:41] God to Christ sealed in there by the
[1:55:44] Holy Ghost the devil can't get to you he
[1:55:49] can't do it he's got to come to the same
[1:55:52] process you did if he did that he would
[1:55:56] be your brother so he can't get to you a
[1:55:58] man he can't come through that oh you
[1:56:02] said but brother branham I receive the
[1:56:04] Holy Ghost yeah two good things of God
[1:56:07] yeah but you're in the courts out yonder
[1:56:09] and that's the reason it don't hold on
[1:56:11] then next to you and the next sort of
[1:56:13] that's the reason this next year you're
[1:56:15] doing pretty good and next year you're
[1:56:17] back in the world and this revival
[1:56:19] you're doing fine by the revival zone
[1:56:21] and when the revivals gone then you're
[1:56:23] going somewhere else and now with the
[1:56:25] world and you say oh I receive the Holy
[1:56:27] Ghost I spoken down I shouted that's all
[1:56:30] right I have nothing to say about that
[1:56:32] but why didn't it hold out that's it
[1:56:35] that's what the world is looking at
[1:56:37] that's what the people are saying if
[1:56:39] you're professing this high calling then
[1:56:42] why are you living that way hey man you
[1:56:45] know the best thing is to live a sermon
[1:56:48] instead of preach one your written
[1:56:50] epistles you can't do it in yourself you
[1:56:53] can impersonate it for a little while
[1:56:55] but your sins will find you out
[1:56:59] you better just consecrate yourself to
[1:57:02] God and get on the inside and shut the
[1:57:05] doors behind you and burn every Bridge
[1:57:07] there is behind you and launch out hey
[1:57:10] man I know that's the truth he says I
[1:57:12] know it'll work if it hadn't been for
[1:57:14] that I don't know what would have become
[1:57:16] of me hallelujah
[1:57:19] hey man you say what brother Tim there's
[1:57:21] a lot of failures on the way well I'll
[1:57:23] tell you you know there has been a lot
[1:57:26] of failures but I'll tell you there's
[1:57:28] some that are still standing this day
[1:57:32] hallelujah Amen still standing to this
[1:57:36] day hallelujah a man that has not give
[1:57:41] up that hasn't quit that hadn't turned
[1:57:44] around that hadn't went back into sin a
[1:57:48] manager still living a blob wash life
[1:57:51] I'll tell you it's not only possible it
[1:57:54] is provided for you this is a kind of
[1:57:57] like God wants in your life is a
[1:58:00] constant overcoming life where you're
[1:58:03] walking with Christ and fellowship and
[1:58:05] with him in Passover it's the night of
[1:58:14] the Passover and we're still in that
[1:58:17] night brother Branham said there are
[1:58:23] three watches of the night for the Jews
[1:58:26] but he said for us there are seven
[1:58:28] watches and we've had the last watchman
[1:58:32] to come out and the last watchman has
[1:58:38] come out the seventh messenger and he
[1:58:40] told us the mornings coming and the
[1:58:44] reason is getting darker it was because
[1:58:46] the Sun is approaching and is pushing
[1:58:49] the the darkness back are you with me a
[1:58:52] man so it's the night of the Passover
[1:58:55] no one's out on the streets there's no

[2:00:11] preparations are being made ready to
[2:00:13] leave brother Branham sitting who do you
[2:00:15] say this is we're in the critical hour
[2:00:17] of the world is but to church the real
[2:00:19] church not the denomination but the
[2:00:21] church itself is ready for the greatest
[2:00:24] triumph that ever made the coming of the
[2:00:27] groom to the bride
[2:00:30] hallelujah we've been in the journey a
[2:00:33] long time
[2:00:34] amen but I'll tell you what I am ready
[2:00:37] I'm more ready than ever hallelujah I
[2:00:43] started preaching this message when I
[2:00:45] was 15 years old but I'm more ready than
[2:00:48] ever for the bridegroom to come for the
[2:00:52] greatest triumph that has ever been but
[2:00:58] the blood must be applied
[2:01:00] he must be applied with hyssop faith
[2:01:03] it's got to be in three places it's got
[2:01:07] to be in the body it's got to be in the
[2:01:10] spirit round and it must be in the soul
[2:01:15] you see just to get it in your flesh is
[2:01:19] not enough
[2:01:21] just said just to conform to message
[2:01:24] standards is not enough and to show all
[2:01:27] the blood has been applied look at my
[2:01:29] holiness look at my dress look at the
[2:01:31] way I am and then that's not enough just
[2:01:35] to get it up on your spirit round and
[2:01:37] your emotions get excited that's not
[2:01:39] enough I'm mad yes it must of course
[2:01:45] come upon your flesh and it must come in
[2:01:47] your spirit round but it must be capped
[2:01:49] off with it coming within the soul of
[2:01:53] man there's a divine order to this do
[2:02:00] the side post first then cap it off with
[2:02:05] the seal of God a man and we're here in
[2:02:11] the homeland where people are coming
[2:02:14] back into Passover the feast the blood
[2:02:18] must be applied you must have the
[2:02:21] presence of the Lord in your dwellings
[2:02:25] are you with me can I say there are
[2:02:29] three places of Passover also the blood
[2:02:33] must be applied with hyssop with faith
[2:02:37] upon the church we've got to have the
[2:02:42] Holy Ghost in the church a man ever
[2:02:47] service we come here we got to get the
[2:02:49] blood flowing
[2:02:51] [Applause]
[2:02:52] hallelujah you know Eagles don't eat
[2:02:55] dead carcasses a man that had been dead
[2:02:59] for you for four days and r-rahman
[2:03:02] stinking come on
[2:03:03] they take the fresh kill meat of the
[2:03:05] word hallelujah where the revelation is
[2:03:09] flowing and the blood begins to flow
[2:03:12] whenever blight is he tear into it the
[2:03:15] Holy Ghost gets all over you
[2:03:23] hallelujah you've gotta have the blood
[2:03:26] in your home the tokens gotta be applied
[2:03:30] and ever dwelling and it must be in the
[2:03:37] temple of your body all three temples we
[2:03:45] are in Passover and we will not leave
[2:03:48] being in Passover until we're called out
[2:03:50] of this dimension in the great exodus
[2:03:53] ahead when the trumpet sounds this time
[2:03:56] of Darkness is a time of darkness upon
[2:04:00] the earth a time where impersonations
[2:04:04] abound now I may be taking a little bit
[2:04:07] too much time tonight but I'm going to
[2:04:13] just speak for a little while tonight
[2:04:16] and Trust the Lord will just give me
[2:04:18] some wisdom here I know you you you have
[2:04:21] sat in here an hour or hour and a half
[2:04:23] before the service started nearly an
[2:04:26] hour before I come out to preach so you
[2:04:29] know it would be a pity to dismiss now
[2:04:43] you see you see it's a time where
[2:04:47] there's darkness on the earth were
[2:04:48] impersonations abound as Janice and Jan
[2:04:52] breeze who whispered Moses with their
[2:04:55] impersonations and you know they were
[2:04:57] able to convince many not to get under
[2:05:01] the blood are you with me I mean it
[2:05:05] would actually harden the hearts of many
[2:05:08] not just Pharaoh but many do you know
[2:05:11] some Jewish scholars say that only one
[2:05:13] in five Israelites left Egypt with Moses
[2:05:16] I wonder if that's true you know only
[2:05:20] 20% of the Jews left Egypt and this so
[2:05:23] demoralized some because a majority of
[2:05:25] the brother brother brother remained
[2:05:27] behind
[2:05:28] no wonder as they got along the journey
[2:05:30] somewhere they kept talking about let's
[2:05:32] return back you know they're back there
[2:05:34] they're back there eating garlic and
[2:05:37] they're back there but they forgot they
[2:05:39] were slaves
[2:05:43] let me have my freedom
[2:05:46] [Applause]
[2:05:47] hey man but I want you say you know what
[2:05:51] an hours to be living in an angel an
[2:05:54] angel came you know the heavens open
[2:05:59] seeing things happen moving from heavens
[2:06:02] that mention right into this dimension
[2:06:04] are you with me a man and the Anna to
[2:06:08] you in 1946 an angel of God um I visited
[2:06:12] a little Kentucky preacher and it
[2:06:15] heralded one of the greatest divine
[2:06:18] healing moves ever in order to forerun
[2:06:22] the his second coming
[2:06:25] are you with me God has done some
[2:06:28] extraordinary things in our age went to
[2:06:32] the extreme to get you to believe I'll
[2:06:37] give you one example right up from my
[2:06:39] place is Little Rock Arkansas may be a
[2:06:42] three-hour drive I was by the School of
[2:06:44] the Deaf here recently
[2:06:46] and then passed by there and I just
[2:06:48] marveled as I thought of it and we
[2:06:51] thought of the testimonies a man where'd
[2:06:56] that was a hundred and fifty two deaf
[2:06:59] and dumb people received their hearing
[2:07:04] after being visited by a forerunner of
[2:07:07] his second coming
[2:07:13] that's incredible I was I've been wrong
[2:07:17] and I I was was there in some it was in
[2:07:20] Germany a couple of years ago and we
[2:07:22] were preaching there and in the meeting
[2:07:25] there was other preachers there too of
[2:07:26] course but in the meetings are a little
[2:07:29] lady walking around with a hearing aids
[2:07:31] in her hand and she says ah you know I
[2:07:35] don't need these anymore
[2:07:36] anybody want these she said I was
[2:07:40] sitting in the service and then I went
[2:07:42] to the shower and as I was in the shower
[2:07:44] there
[2:07:45] I had my hearing aids out and I could
[2:07:48] hear children outside playing I can hear
[2:07:51] birds with singing and said I you know I
[2:07:54] could hear the shower running I don't
[2:07:57] need these hearing aids anymore
[2:08:00] that was one person but we're talking
[2:08:03] about a hundred and fifty two of them
[2:08:07] because God was doing some extreme
[2:08:10] things to get you to believe are you
[2:08:14] with me
[2:08:15] a man deport Romney his second coming to
[2:08:18] get us
[2:08:18] in preparation start believe it VIN
[2:08:22] became that God was sending a message
[2:08:24] for an accident
[2:08:27] 19:55 brother branham was taking a
[2:08:30] careful examination of his ministry and
[2:08:33] the divine healing campaigns had turned
[2:08:36] into men to a rat race of who has the
[2:08:40] biggest tent who has the most
[2:08:42] subscribers to their magazine it was all
[2:08:45] about preachers and their ego a man you
[2:08:51] know I tell you I I think sometimes we
[2:08:53] should have learned our lesson many
[2:08:55] years ago about personality cult
[2:08:58] followings a man I'm not interested in a
[2:09:04] personality cult following I want people
[2:09:07] to get in love with Jesus I can do one
[2:09:11] thing what we're here in this meeting
[2:09:13] let's get in love with Jesus let's come
[2:09:16] to know human
[2:09:17] power of his resurrection that will save
[2:09:20] you deliver your sexy free sector soul
[2:09:24] on fire with glod yet the man who the
[2:09:31] angel came to and who was the most
[2:09:33] gifted William Branham had no magazine
[2:09:35] no tent and no ego just a sincere desire
[2:09:41] to help God's people
[2:09:45] I'm brother Branham said one day I was
[2:09:47] praying and God gave me the name the
[2:09:49] type of voice of healing and the rank
[2:09:51] would write with my ministry the voice
[2:09:53] of one crying in the wilderness and so
[2:09:55] forth so I gave it to name the voice of
[2:09:56] healing he had a magazine yet William
[2:10:00] Branham simply signed a magazine over to
[2:10:02] Gordon Lindsay and even the organization
[2:10:05] that they had formed the voice of
[2:10:08] healing signed it over to Gordon Lindsay
[2:10:10] along with his tent and later he would
[2:10:13] actually have to rent his own tent from
[2:10:17] the voice of healing that was paid and
[2:10:22] bought with money's that was collected
[2:10:24] in his meetings brother Branham was
[2:10:29] Hayley and three witnesses he said I
[2:10:31] started in I organized it a little paper
[2:10:33] said I we I organized a little paper
[2:10:36] called a voice of healing they still
[2:10:38] have it here well I found out then
[2:10:39] there's lots of finances and stuff
[2:10:42] hooked up to it so I washed my hands of
[2:10:44] that stuff a long time ago so the voice
[2:10:47] of healing is not my paper I have
[2:10:48] nothing to do with it not at all that
[2:10:50] belongs to brother Lindsay at three-port
[2:10:53] Louisiana they would move it from three
[2:10:55] port to Dallas Texas cuz three port
[2:10:57] didn't have a a an airport at that time
[2:11:01] and come to find out I got into that I
[2:11:03] thought I was kidding out of
[2:11:05] organizations and I got into one and it
[2:11:08] was still just almost organized down to
[2:11:11] every one of them in there and I belong
[2:11:13] to just the Lord Jesus and then I can
[2:11:16] come and go anywhere I wish to and
[2:11:18] wherever he whatever he leads me to do I
[2:11:22] can be free
[2:11:24] let me give you a little history here
[2:11:27] you know this this man William Branham
[2:11:29] was so humble and so sincere too sincere
[2:11:34] and too dedicated to God's service to
[2:11:37] desire a big organization you know he
[2:11:43] wanted to devote his time in prayer and
[2:11:46] waiting on God and meeting with the
[2:11:49] angel and seeing the visas many of them
[2:11:51] before even walked out to the platform
[2:11:54] he didn't want to be strapped with all
[2:11:57] the finances and the worries and on the
[2:12:01] other hand all Roberts built a
[2:12:03] university named it after himself and he
[2:12:08] joined the United Methodist Church
[2:12:09] because they offered more linen see and
[2:12:11] doctrinal and moral issues than the
[2:12:14] Pentecostal Holiness Church so he
[2:12:17] positioned himself as being more
[2:12:19] mainstream denomination so he could be
[2:12:22] more popular and accepted carnal
[2:12:26] historians looking back on this can't
[2:12:28] understand they can't wrap their mind
[2:12:31] around why the man with the greatest
[2:12:34] gift who met an angel not one time but
[2:12:39] hundreds of times his ministry
[2:12:42] accompanied night after night by the
[2:12:44] pillar of fire yet they want to paint
[2:12:46] him as being too illiterate or perhaps
[2:12:49] too naive or too simple to build a huge
[2:12:53] Kingdom from and for himself they just
[2:12:55] can't understand why man wouldn't want
[2:12:59] to Kingdom and yet this is not the truth
[2:13:03] the truth was he just wasn't interested
[2:13:05] in kingdom building and super egos he
[2:13:09] gave up his own paper to the voice of
[2:13:11] healing that God gave him the name of
[2:13:13] gave the tempter to a Gordon Lindsay and
[2:13:16] the voice of healing and then paid rent
[2:13:18] on the tenth a tenth purchase from money
[2:13:20] that comes from the campaigns and this
[2:13:24] man was one who met the angel he had a
[2:13:27] gift that set him apart and above all
[2:13:32] the other healing evangelist and he
[2:13:35] could have been a multi
[2:13:37] multi-millionaire but refused it now
[2:13:44] 1955 he would quit and go home because
[2:13:47] it wasn't enough money to cover the
[2:13:50] campaigns and he said I told God if it
[2:13:53] wasn't you know if I have to beg for
[2:13:55] offerings and and everything else he
[2:13:57] said I'll just go home and he was
[2:14:00] fifteen thousand dollars in debt this
[2:14:03] was over in California that was
[2:14:05] equivalent to a hundred and thirty
[2:14:06] thousand dollars in today's money and he
[2:14:09] goes home broke Durance this subsequent
[2:14:13] and investigation and I got this from
[2:14:16] Wikipedia
[2:14:20] his manager Gordon Lindsey was taking
[2:14:23] most of the money for his own use
[2:14:26] William Branham had a salary of seven
[2:14:29] thousand dollars while Lindsay made
[2:14:31] $80,000 to manage his campaigns in
[2:14:34] today's money brother branham made a
[2:14:37] salary of about sixty two thousand
[2:14:39] dollars a year while Lindsay pocketed
[2:14:41] seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars
[2:14:43] a year and all this went to the voice of
[2:14:46] the healing foundation which would be
[2:14:47] later changed to Lindsay's Christ for
[2:14:50] the nation in Dallas Texas in its Bible
[2:14:52] school and our University made you know
[2:14:56] on the funds you know it was like Elijah
[2:14:58] Elisha refused the money from naming the
[2:15:01] leper who was healed but forget Bukka
[2:15:05] haze' the servant took it and became a
[2:15:09] leper
[2:15:11] if brother Branham didn't want the money
[2:15:13] well Linton's he did so he built a
[2:15:15] kingdom with it so it wasn't it all that
[2:15:19] God had failed to provide it was that
[2:15:21] men with their own greed and agendas
[2:15:23] were misusing the funds and now the
[2:15:26] field had become crowded with
[2:15:28] impersonators who were touting the
[2:15:30] biggest tenth the biggest magazines were
[2:15:33] the most subscribers the most miracles
[2:15:35] and television programs and the man who
[2:15:38] was visited by the angel with the real
[2:15:40] message was pushed aside by the masses
[2:15:45] impersonators Aros brother Brandon goes
[2:15:49] out there's only one met by an angel the
[2:15:53] only one with a true gift now the others
[2:15:56] were anointed but William Branham was
[2:15:58] set apart and known as a man sent from
[2:16:02] God
[2:16:02] I've not what we say about him that's
[2:16:05] what they said about him
[2:16:07] they called him a 20th century of
[2:16:09] prophet and man they called him a
[2:16:12] prophet visit South Africa all Roberts
[2:16:18] comes to see Jack Cole comes to see
[2:16:20] brother Branham talks about all Roberts
[2:16:23] Vinson in there he's a little ragged
[2:16:26] Tenten I was in the final auditorium and
[2:16:28] he said he sat on my sidelines and was
[2:16:31] in the meetings and afterwards he said
[2:16:33] brother Branham you think God would hear
[2:16:34] my prayers he said he'll hear anybody's
[2:16:36] prayer Laurel he said now I sit in his
[2:16:39] sidelines Jack cope went to see you
[2:16:47] remember the story many of you probably
[2:16:49] have read it or heard about it he went
[2:16:51] to the meeting as a skeptic he was
[2:16:53] Assembly of God preacher and it was a
[2:16:56] you know he had heard about the miracles
[2:16:59] and the gift and you know he he was
[2:17:03] skeptical of it he said he was and he
[2:17:05] said but there was a man who was blind
[2:17:09] and he had no eyeballs and brother
[2:17:14] Branham told him that in three days
[2:17:17] eyeballs will form in your head
[2:17:20] and you after that you will see well
[2:17:23] I'll not Jax listening to this and he
[2:17:25] kind of scoffs at this and then he said
[2:17:28] anybody could say that you know this man
[2:17:30] if he disappears off the platform who
[2:17:33] know where he is next you know there's
[2:17:34] thousands of people out here and so you
[2:17:38] know but Jack sitting on the platform
[2:17:40] and on his way out brother Brandon
[2:17:43] passes by him and stopped touch him on
[2:17:46] the knee is knee and prayed softly and
[2:17:48] he says you're not sick
[2:17:50] you're just worn down from preaching
[2:17:52] meetings but don't be skeptical you were
[2:17:55] doubting whether this is of God or not I
[2:17:57] want to tell you that this is of God and
[2:18:00] we are both fighting the same devil go
[2:18:02] on and continue in your revival for you
[2:18:04] were also called to pray for the sick by
[2:18:09] the way every preacher every man called
[2:18:11] of God is called afraid for the sick in
[2:18:15] fact every believer even the little
[2:18:19] mother at home is called a cast Satan
[2:18:21] out what Jack said
[2:18:28] I went home you know walking on cloud
[2:18:30] nine you know I'm gonna have a healing
[2:18:32] ministry and he said I decided to go
[2:18:36] back to the meeting in three days and he
[2:18:38] said I come back and he said I found
[2:18:40] that man and sure enough eyeballs had
[2:18:42] been formed in his head but he still it
[2:18:44] he couldn't see but he said by that
[2:18:46] evening the man were blind men was
[2:18:48] seeing and shouting all over the place
[2:18:50] the glories of God he said William
[2:18:55] Branham was born four dispensational
[2:18:58] purposes and I say amen to that
[2:19:03] well Jagger's come to see him before
[2:19:05] long did you know they the field is
[2:19:08] crowded with impersonators and you know
[2:19:11] again you know you wind up with wood
[2:19:14] with all Roberts with a ministry one of
[2:19:17] the most recognized preachers worldwide
[2:19:21] died a disgrace with false prophecies
[2:19:28] Jack go start out humbly enough but as
[2:19:31] his ego grew in his quest to be the best
[2:19:35] he wouldn't measured or roberts10 and
[2:19:37] built her one foot bigger her few inches
[2:19:40] bigger so he could out having the
[2:19:43] biggest tenth the biggest magazine with
[2:19:47] the most subscribers and Jack would be
[2:19:49] the first to die was off to seeing the
[2:19:51] 38 years of age hey Allen began with his
[2:19:55] tenth began being arrested for
[2:19:58] drunkenness finally found dead at the
[2:20:00] age of 59 police found his body in the
[2:20:03] room strewed with with pills and empty
[2:20:06] liquor bottles a 12 to a investigation
[2:20:09] on top see the coroner's report
[2:20:11] concluded he died from liver failure
[2:20:13] brought on by acute alcoholism and the
[2:20:16] coroner reported that when Allen died he
[2:20:19] had a blood alcohol content of point 36
[2:20:22] which is enough to ensure a deep coma
[2:20:25] and Bol Jagger's another a similar God
[2:20:28] preacher who was inspired by the
[2:20:30] miracles that he saw in brother
[2:20:32] Brandon's meetings no doubt starting out
[2:20:35] humbly but see and he could be enriched
[2:20:37] by the crowds that were attracted and
[2:20:40] not having an angelic visitation or the
[2:20:42] gifts he started promoting the sale of
[2:20:44] blood and oil and that he got from a
[2:20:48] woman's body sold it for the purpose of
[2:20:50] healing then vitamins from the Dead Sea
[2:20:51] and then baptized into eternal life
[2:20:54] claiming they would never dive he
[2:20:56] baptized him and that wasn't enough the
[2:20:59] Pentecostals started manufacturing
[2:21:01] tongues
[2:21:03] and impersonated the gift of tongues by
[2:21:08] confusing the language with babbling are
[2:21:12] you with me a man in 1955 brother
[2:21:15] branham has certain vision and he's
[2:21:17] shown the third tall and he was shown
[2:21:20] that his managers were mishandling the
[2:21:22] funds misuse and the funds that their
[2:21:24] emphasis was on money so he saw them
[2:21:26] taking the offering but no altar call
[2:21:29] was given and they muttered wasn't well
[2:21:32] wasn't Christ left with twelve when he
[2:21:34] told him the truth and this would be the
[2:21:38] very thing that would happen a man
[2:21:41] because again they their emphases turn
[2:21:45] from helping the people and healing and
[2:21:48] delivering and Seussian people saved
[2:21:51] under the emphases was all we took the
[2:21:54] offering and didn't finally you know
[2:21:58] they that that mattered will wasn't
[2:22:00] Christ his brother Brent said well you
[2:22:03] know who just miss he's just missing the
[2:22:05] meeting so well was in Christ you don't
[2:22:07] let for twelve when he told him the
[2:22:09] truth
[2:22:10] and this this was a foul of the healing
[2:22:13] campaigns sometimes you wonder whatever
[2:22:15] happened to it that's what happened it
[2:22:18] became all about money prestige
[2:22:22] popularity nobody you know who wanted to
[2:22:26] attract crowds and the masses could
[2:22:29] preach the truth troubled about the
[2:22:33] impersonators brother Branham sought the
[2:22:35] Lord and he had a vision of the third
[2:22:37] pole we're in the tenth miracles were
[2:22:40] performed in a little room away from the
[2:22:43] eyes of the impersonators but then he
[2:22:47] also saw that the church had to come
[2:22:49] away from had to come away from carnally
[2:22:53] impersonating the new birth and they
[2:22:56] were they were receiving an
[2:22:58] impersonation and it was either Billy
[2:23:01] Graham's intellectualism
[2:23:03] and his intellectual conception are the
[2:23:07] Pentecostals fanaticism to extremes
[2:23:13] all right now so you some brother
[2:23:16] branham beginning to preach on why
[2:23:18] Pentecost failed and they wouldn't grow
[2:23:21] up in Christ that wouldn't take the word
[2:23:24] that wanted to just perpetuate the
[2:23:28] babyhood Ephraim wanted to plant corn in
[2:23:31] manassas field in other words everybody
[2:23:34] wanted a healing ministry for the money
[2:23:36] and the fame and the power and the glory
[2:23:39] that went with it and Pentecost was
[2:23:42] refusing to go deeper into the genuine
[2:23:45] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[2:23:47] Ghost
[2:23:50] brother Branham preached the
[2:23:52] impersonation of Christianity that not
[2:23:55] only were the healing gets me and
[2:23:56] impersonated but the Christian life was
[2:23:59] being impersonated by claims of either
[2:24:02] shaking the preachers hand and either
[2:24:05] believe is amore some fanatical
[2:24:07] sensation or a manufactured tongue and
[2:24:11] yet lives were not changed and instead
[2:24:15] there was a cheap impersonation of the
[2:24:18] gospel I'm talking about Janice and
[2:24:21] Jambres now a man that would call some
[2:24:25] to disbelieve and lose heart a man
[2:24:30] brother Branham would preach the hidden
[2:24:32] life with Christ showing why people
[2:24:34] can't keep the victory the manner wasn't
[2:24:37] lasting their light kept going out he
[2:24:41] pointed out that they had failed to come
[2:24:43] into the holiest of holies hey man can I
[2:24:47] bring you back down to the Passover to
[2:24:49] come behind the blood they had failed to
[2:24:52] come to the holiest of Holies where the
[2:24:54] same pot of manna are you with me which
[2:24:58] rather where that was on the the
[2:25:00] original Pentecost that never breeds
[2:25:03] worms and never gives tail are you with
[2:25:09] me I ran the day royally refusing to
[2:25:12] come to that manner among the original
[2:25:17] Pentecost a man will come with it's a
[2:25:20] kind of glory light
[2:25:22] the pillar fire never dims or goes out
[2:25:26] to come into a place where dead-stick
[2:25:30] place and the presence of God comes to
[2:25:33] life and bears fruit hallelujah I know
[2:25:38] it's true because I was a dead stick
[2:25:41] [Applause]
[2:25:43] hallelujah that laid in the presence of
[2:25:45] that Shekinah glory and came to life
[2:25:51] hallelujah were Aaron's rod blooms and
[2:25:56] the presence of God he was showing that
[2:25:59] your life must be in Passover in
[2:26:02] communion sealed away with Christ where
[2:26:06] you are sealed in and Satan is sealed
[2:26:08] out with a constant fellowship with
[2:26:11] Jesus a man the hidden life were one is
[2:26:15] in Passover and will not be impersonated
[2:26:20] Amanda the veiled shut between you and
[2:26:23] the world come on
[2:26:25] a man where the life of Christ is
[2:26:29] present now I'm going to take you to the
[2:26:31] scripture that he preached from Ezekiel
[2:26:34] 36 and verse 25 where he began to preach
[2:26:37] and this is exactly where it lays in the
[2:26:41] Old Testament of the new birth that was
[2:26:43] promised when he said to Nicodemus oh
[2:26:46] you know you're a master in Israel and
[2:26:48] you don't know what I mean when you say
[2:26:49] you must be born again it was written in
[2:26:52] the word that a new birth was coming and
[2:26:55] then I will sprinkle clean water upon
[2:26:57] you and you shall be clean from all your
[2:27:00] filthiness and from all your idols will
[2:27:03] I cleanse you a new heart also will I
[2:27:07] give you and a new spirit will I put
[2:27:10] within you and I will take away the
[2:27:13] stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[2:27:16] give you a heart of flesh and I will put
[2:27:18] my spirit within you and will cause you
[2:27:22] to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep
[2:27:25] my judgments
[2:27:27] to them and Oh hallelujah
[2:27:30] you said well in the land that I have
[2:27:33] gave your father's and you shall be my
[2:27:36] people and I will be your God there are
[2:27:47] people returning back to the homeland
[2:27:51] and that is about the Holy Ghost that
[2:27:56] puts you into this land brother Branham
[2:28:10] shows it's a new heart is your intellect
[2:28:12] and it's a new way of thinking it's God
[2:28:17] and large in the mind and making the
[2:28:20] Word of God believable a man that's what
[2:28:24] the new heart is and yet you can have
[2:28:27] your thinking change and not have
[2:28:29] received the hell of the Holy Ghost an
[2:28:32] impersonation of Christianity he
[2:28:34] explained so God had to give you a new
[2:28:37] heart not a patched up one a new heart
[2:28:40] that your intellect that you think with
[2:28:42] a new way of thinking and when he give
[2:28:45] you a new way of thinking yes that's
[2:28:47] right the Bible looks to be reasonable
[2:28:50] I used to didn't believe it that I
[2:28:52] believe it now see that's your great
[2:28:54] revival they say yes I don't want to go
[2:28:58] to hell I want to accept Christ that's
[2:29:00] all good that's good that's just your
[2:29:03] first step
[2:29:05] are you with me hey man there's there's
[2:29:08] three places the blood must be applied
[2:29:11] are you with me this was Billy Graham in
[2:29:14] his revival the Spirit of God was moving
[2:29:17] and thousands would flock to you
[2:29:20] soldiers haven't received a new heart a
[2:29:23] new thinking why the Bible's reasonable
[2:29:27] I don't want to go to hell I will make
[2:29:29] heaven my home and
[2:29:31] if a rock star our movie star a ball
[2:29:35] star says so and thinks it's the right
[2:29:37] thing to do
[2:29:38] well I'll become a Christian too here's
[2:29:42] some years ago I was in our cabin there
[2:29:44] with my friend brother Dan Dyer was
[2:29:47] there with me and and and I don't
[2:29:50] normally turn on the television my wife
[2:29:52] will tell you I hardly ever look at
[2:29:53] something like that but nevertheless
[2:29:55] I've flipped on the channel and saw
[2:29:58] Billy Graham let's together what's this
[2:29:59] so I watched him and they had given
[2:30:02] criticism that the song just as I am was
[2:30:07] was causing people to move so Billy
[2:30:10] Billy decided that service he would not
[2:30:14] even have a song when they sing but
[2:30:17] before you know he has the his sermon
[2:30:20] that he preached his own he has a rock
[2:30:22] star come out and play a song and
[2:30:25] testified that he had given his heart to
[2:30:28] the Lord and he sings a little said a
[2:30:30] little jingle there and then he has a
[2:30:32] coach Shiva of a soccer team which this
[2:30:36] was in England this film was so you know
[2:30:39] this guy comes out and tells about how
[2:30:41] him and his wife had received Christ as
[2:30:44] her personal Saviour in their life had
[2:30:46] been changed you know these things you
[2:30:48] know movie stars and great men are
[2:30:50] accepting cry is the right thing to do
[2:30:53] it's acceptable you know it's a it's
[2:30:56] them it's the what we ought to do today
[2:30:58] you know the right thing to do I become
[2:31:01] a Christian too but the Holy Spirit is
[2:31:04] not a noose hop
[2:31:07] though it will change your thinking a
[2:31:12] man a new thought now we bring that
[2:31:14] concept into the message and hold on
[2:31:16] here and you must have your thoughts
[2:31:20] changed I mean what God is doing great
[2:31:23] things God sent a prophet I believe it
[2:31:26] the seals were opened I believe that
[2:31:29] serpents see that just makes sense what
[2:31:33] is God doing he's giving you a new heart
[2:31:36] and then you beginning to look at the
[2:31:39] word wow that's a--that's a reasonable I
[2:31:42] can understand that I can accept that
[2:31:44] wow that makes sense make simple a lot
[2:31:47] more sense than eating an apple right a
[2:31:53] man but you know and that's what we do
[2:31:56] around the message we give people
[2:31:57] knowledge and they receive it but that's
[2:32:01] only a new heart
[2:32:04] hey man it's like Billy Graham did he
[2:32:07] gave people knowledge that Jesus loved
[2:32:09] them and died for them and they accept
[2:32:12] that knowledge and believe it but what
[2:32:14] do they have just a new heart a man it's
[2:32:19] not enough to keep the Death Angel away
[2:32:23] it's not enough to take you in a rapture
[2:32:27] hey man now you know they get a new
[2:32:30] heart the brother branham said in God's
[2:32:32] provided a lamb not in electro fate
[2:32:34] that's what's the matter with our our
[2:32:36] revivals today now here we get it Billy
[2:32:40] Graham's axilor many great men all
[2:32:43] Roberts great evangelists on the field
[2:32:44] has calmed this nation back and forth
[2:32:46] altar calls have been made enough to
[2:32:48] convert a thousand Americas but the
[2:32:53] reason it's only it's only the people
[2:32:56] are brought to an intellectual faith
[2:32:58] even they would just go a little deeper
[2:33:01] till that faith come from the
[2:33:04] intellectual and soak down into the soul
[2:33:08] it would last
[2:33:10] but the reason about 80% 90% of the
[2:33:13] converts said that comes in
[2:33:15] I was gone before six months is gone it
[2:33:18] is because it only had an intellectual
[2:33:20] conception but when it becomes an
[2:33:23] experience of being born again of the
[2:33:25] Spirit of God that anchors to eternity
[2:33:30] now there's an election side the message
[2:33:33] now it is a new heart and suddenly it's
[2:33:37] wonderful that the word is believable a
[2:33:40] man and we gain understanding that of
[2:33:44] the great mysteries but still that isn't
[2:33:47] it Paul would say until I understand all
[2:33:52] mysteries and all knowledge and yet not
[2:33:56] have to charity which is the basic
[2:33:59] element of God's nature that comes by
[2:34:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:34:05] he said I'm nothing now you see that's
[2:34:10] the hyssop hyssop represents faith the
[2:34:15] blood is applied by faith but you can
[2:34:19] have all the hyssop you want and wave it
[2:34:23] in the face of the death angel and it
[2:34:25] won't save you from his wrath and then
[2:34:29] the tribulation is coming and you need
[2:34:31] faith just as Israel needed hyssop but
[2:34:35] you must have the blood applied and when
[2:34:40] your faith wasn't given to you just
[2:34:42] accept a creed or a statement of faith
[2:34:45] the hyssop without blood
[2:34:48] it's just hyssop believe them the
[2:34:51] message is not enough believe in the
[2:34:54] seals are ugly is not enough it's only
[2:34:57] hyssop your faith is not to be in the
[2:35:01] seals your faith is to be in the blood
[2:35:04] that was sad
[2:35:07] personally for you
[2:35:09] [Applause]
[2:35:10] hallelujah your faith was be anointed it
[2:35:15] must be plunged it must be dipped in the
[2:35:18] blood the Holy Spirit and applied to
[2:35:21] seal out the Death Angel striking the
[2:35:27] doorpost with hyssop that's not dipped
[2:35:30] in blood will accomplish nothing
[2:35:32] a man their spiritual Israelites today
[2:35:36] who claim to believe and have a hyssop
[2:35:39] in their hand say but yet but they have
[2:35:42] not a trace of blood because you can see
[2:35:45] the death angel is all over them are you
[2:35:48] with me
[2:35:49] it comes in their house with television
[2:35:53] with Hollywood dress with makeup with
[2:35:57] pornography with slothful lazy lives and
[2:36:01] no desperation and no sincerity and no
[2:36:05] dedication hey man they're not in
[2:36:10] fellowship with God they're not in
[2:36:12] communion they're not in Passover
[2:36:16] brother banner would say in the token
[2:36:19] message apply a church now don't fail
[2:36:21] will you now don't don't don't let the
[2:36:24] Sun set don't don't don't don't rest day
[2:36:27] or night
[2:36:28] don't take no chance it won't work
[2:36:30] children it won't work you must have the
[2:36:33] token you say I believe yes I go yeah I
[2:36:37] believe the message that's all right but
[2:36:39] then that's good but you must have the
[2:36:42] token
[2:36:43] do you hear Branum Tabernacle you must
[2:36:46] have the token displayed a man without
[2:36:50] it all you're believing is in vain you
[2:36:55] live a good life you listen to what the
[2:36:57] word says you go to church you try to
[2:37:00] live right and that's fine but that's
[2:37:03] not it when I see the bud that's the
[2:37:07] token
[2:37:09] hallelujah oh don't let me just use a
[2:37:12] word dairy that gets a little bit
[2:37:14] ambiguous token the token is the Holy
[2:37:17] Ghost when I see the Holy Ghost I will
[2:37:22] pass over you a man it's the only way
[2:37:25] that you can escape the Death Angel and
[2:37:28] the tribulation that is coming so don't
[2:37:33] just come this far and say I believe the
[2:37:35] message you obey the messenger come into
[2:37:38] Christ you say well I believe every word
[2:37:41] said brother Branham that's good
[2:37:43] but that's just being able to read take
[2:37:46] the message and take it in your heart
[2:37:48] that you must have the token the very
[2:37:50] life that was in Christ being you when I
[2:37:53] see that I'll pass over you but God said
[2:37:59] also I'll give you a new spirit now this
[2:38:01] is the other side of the pendulum you're
[2:38:06] on one side you got you got you got a
[2:38:08] new heart the other side a new spirit
[2:38:11] you must supply the blood here you must
[2:38:14] supply there are you with me I'll give
[2:38:18] you enough I'll give you a new spirit
[2:38:20] now this is the opposite side of
[2:38:22] intellectualism the new spirit again is
[2:38:26] not the Holy Spirit amen that's when the
[2:38:29] seed of your emotions gets cleaned up
[2:38:32] and may new and you shout and you dance
[2:38:37] and you rejoice a man just as a new hard
[2:38:41] earth new thinking is important to your
[2:38:44] overall experience you need a new spirit
[2:38:46] a man the impersonation of Christianity
[2:38:52] said now notice the order of the
[2:38:54] scripture it's it's perfect God said
[2:38:57] I'll take away the old stony heart you
[2:38:59] can't receive nothing then he said I'll
[2:39:01] give you a new spirit now that ain't the
[2:39:04] Holy Spirit and that's where the mistake
[2:39:06] has been made a lot of people come to
[2:39:08] the altar to pray and they get down to
[2:39:11] praying and praying to get the feeling a
[2:39:13] little better
[2:39:13] they might get up and go on and jump
[2:39:15] around a little bit and after a while
[2:39:17] they just bounce bounce
[2:39:19] bounce back again they never received
[2:39:23] the Holy Spirit no matter how much they
[2:39:26] bounce or how much they scream or how
[2:39:29] much oil run out of their hands and they
[2:39:31] had bloody faces or how much they spoke
[2:39:33] in tongues or how much they shouted or
[2:39:35] what they did there's nothing at all to
[2:39:38] do with it that was only human emotions
[2:39:42] they got a new spirit and they rejoice
[2:39:45] with it hey man I'm gonna say something
[2:39:49] he said I wanted to sink deep and may
[2:39:51] God help there is the emotional side of
[2:39:55] the so-called Holy Ghost Church today
[2:39:59] they get a lot of build-up fanaticism
[2:40:02] and run off here because they disregard
[2:40:04] the word they are only go they go only
[2:40:07] together oh we had a great meeting
[2:40:09] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now
[2:40:11] when you do that and don't bear the
[2:40:13] fruit of the Spirit then you're in the
[2:40:14] new spirit you didn't used to do that
[2:40:17] that's right but God gave you a new
[2:40:19] spirit why the spirit you had you
[2:40:21] couldn't even get along with yourself so
[2:40:23] how you're gonna get along with God
[2:40:26] [Applause]
[2:40:28] hallelujah hey man I'm glad to come into
[2:40:31] church and get your spirit lifted shout
[2:40:34] a little bit and release some of the
[2:40:36] grief troubles of the AIDS and the
[2:40:38] things that you're in but that ain't the
[2:40:40] Holy Ghost it might be the spirit moving
[2:40:44] on your emotions but that itself is not
[2:40:48] the Holy Ghost so you can believe and
[2:40:51] have a new heart and yet not have the
[2:40:53] Holy Ghost you can get a new spirit and
[2:40:56] you can shout and then you have your
[2:40:58] emotions charged by the word and not
[2:41:01] have the indwelling spirit but God will
[2:41:05] still take you beyond what can be
[2:41:07] impersonated into a hidden life with
[2:41:11] Christ where the world and sin is cut
[2:41:15] off and you are behind the blood
[2:41:19] that's why says in verse 27 a man
[2:41:23] because going through with you a man he
[2:41:26] caps it off with blood right over the
[2:41:29] notes from only both sides right here to
[2:41:32] get right deep down into the soul are
[2:41:34] you with me over the doorpost and I will
[2:41:37] put in my spirit not a new spirit not a
[2:41:42] new heart not a new thinking all we
[2:41:45] believe seven seed in the seals we
[2:41:47] believe God's in a probably not just a
[2:41:50] new thinking I mean not just a new
[2:41:52] shouted I didn't used to shout but now I
[2:41:55] get my motion stirred when I come to
[2:41:57] church it's more than that I will put my
[2:42:00] spirit within you and will cause you to
[2:42:04] walk in my statutes and you Sal did you
[2:42:08] hear me you shall keep my judgments and

[2:45:44] about being a Christian your own
[2:45:47] experience Alleluia ah yeah we but you
[2:45:53] know we want to substitute we don't want
[2:45:55] to be we don't want to be Pentecostal so
[2:46:00] we'll just take an intellectual
[2:46:01] conception of the message a man now
[2:46:06] listen to me but we have an eternal
[2:46:08] prescription it still works
[2:46:11] I'm here to tell you still works the
[2:46:15] Taira prescription still works around
[2:46:18] unless we get some quack pharmacist that
[2:46:20] kind of mess with the prescription amen
[2:46:24] but if will keep it the way the word
[2:46:25] said hallelujah brother Brennan said
[2:46:31] what's the matter with the Pentecostal
[2:46:33] church today we live too close to
[2:46:35] Hollywood we got too much a Hollywood
[2:46:37] evangelism study the old-fashioned type
[2:46:40] that digs down and cleans up and boils
[2:46:43] out and gets men and women right with
[2:46:45] God you know that's right he said I'm
[2:46:47] just the old-fashioned kind that likes
[2:46:50] the old-fashioned religion that's the
[2:46:52] way I got it down at the altar was
[2:46:55] somebody beating me in the back till I
[2:46:57] come through and that's what we need
[2:46:59] today instead of amongst this triad
[2:47:02] repentance and putting her name on her
[2:47:04] church look
[2:47:05] I don't know yeah there is a hidden life
[2:47:10] where the veil drops around you sealing
[2:47:14] the world and sent out a pot of manna
[2:47:17] that never gets stale you never get
[2:47:21] tired of eating it
[2:47:23] hallelujah no you don't ever get stale
[2:47:26] and old to you the light of the Sun of
[2:47:28] gloats the kind of glory never dims and
[2:47:31] dead streaks comes alive and her
[2:47:34] fruit-bearing hallelujah oh yeah you say
[2:47:38] but-but-but brother Branham said that
[2:47:40] the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit sealed
[2:47:43] cannot be broken you've all heard me
[2:47:46] saved the people said the devil made me
[2:47:48] do that no no no the devil didn't make
[2:47:50] you do it you just wasn't sealed in so
[2:47:53] then because when you're sealed in he's
[2:47:56] sealed out hey man he's home I think of
[2:48:02] that now but those were the new only one
[2:48:05] new heart are an intellectual change or
[2:48:08] a new spirit an emotional charge but
[2:48:12] without the Spirit of God in 12 of them
[2:48:15] they'll go through the trial of
[2:48:17] tribulation brother Branham said they
[2:48:19] will wind up in the tribulation because
[2:48:22] they are actually not under the blood he
[2:48:27] said they claim they are but they're not
[2:48:29] a man he said how could they go through
[2:48:33] a trial to prove he Rifai them when the
[2:48:35] bleached blood of Jesus Christ takes
[2:48:38] every symptom of sin and stuff away from
[2:48:41] him you're already dead your life is
[2:48:43] hidden him through God sealed in there
[2:48:46] by the Holy Ghost what are you gonna be
[2:48:48] jobs for what are you gonna get your fur
[2:48:49] for your purification what do you have
[2:48:52] to be purified from when you're
[2:48:53] perfectly in Christ sinless
[2:48:58] hallelujah save us Oh hallelujah
[2:49:03] that's we it is it's got to be applied

[2:49:09] everybody passing by talking to you has
[2:49:12] any associates with you seeing the blood
[2:49:14] is applied and the token of the life
[2:49:16] that was in that blood is upon you and
[2:49:18] you're safe from wrath that alone not
[2:49:22] membership I might just call you're
[2:49:25] sitting on the message pew don't save
[2:49:27] you you can go to my church brother
[2:49:29] Donny's church go to go to brother Ron
[2:49:31] Church doesn't matter where you go and
[2:49:34] man membership will not save you there's
[2:49:37] only one thing you must come under the
[2:49:40] blood you must receive the Holy Ghost
[2:49:42] and Israel was commanded to stay under
[2:49:47] the blood till the marching orders came
[2:49:49] are you with me now hey man now if
[2:49:53] you're watching your clock I probably
[2:49:54] won't go past 10 o'clock but if I do I

[2:50:09] you still be locked in this is better
[2:50:12] than the ballgame stay in the house was
[2:50:16] the order don't leave eat on the lam
[2:50:19] under the protection and the blood until
[2:50:22] you're called out in a rapture this must
[2:50:26] be eaten in a state of preparedness
[2:50:28] ready to go from the slaying of the
[2:50:32] Passover lamb to cow from at Calvary
[2:50:35] until now it's been night you stay in
[2:50:39] the Passover until the trumpet sounds in
[2:50:42] the morning a man exodus 12:22 take a
[2:50:46] bill to hyssop dipped it in the blood
[2:50:49] that's in the base and strike the lentil
[2:50:51] the sous I posed for the blood that is
[2:50:54] in the basin and none of you shall go
[2:50:56] out of the door of his house until
[2:50:58] morning
[2:51:00] so you see we can see the evening
[2:51:03] shadows are approaching and wrath is
[2:51:06] about to fall and God he is requiring a
[2:51:11] token that you yourself have received
[2:51:14] his token the Holy Ghost and it's the
[2:51:18] only way and the only sign that God will
[2:51:21] ever pass and listen because it is the
[2:51:25] literal life of Jesus Christ returned
[2:51:29] back into the believer
[2:51:33] amen now brother Branham would preach
[2:51:37] this sermon the token and he said it was
[2:51:40] a sermon needed to follow the seals it's
[2:51:46] a sermon declaring that the token the
[2:51:49] sign God's requiring is the literal life
[2:51:52] of Jesus Christ
[2:51:54] the Holy Ghost and that the blood of
[2:51:57] Christ the Holy Ghost that is a
[2:51:59] prerequisite for the rapture now after
[2:52:02] the token message
[2:52:04] he'll preach sermons like desperations
[2:52:06] that evening and he and he kind of
[2:52:09] continues the same song and he says um
[2:52:12] he refers back to the morning sermon on
[2:52:15] the token he said this morning
[2:52:18] referring to the token sermon he tells
[2:52:20] us a message here's two-ply the token
[2:52:23] get the holy ghost he said the message
[2:52:26] this morning to me was to me the
[2:52:29] highlights message of my entire ministry
[2:52:36] some of you like to preach the
[2:52:38] highlights
[2:52:40] it's the token the literal life of
[2:52:44] Christ must be in here someday I'll tell
[2:52:47] you how I come about but I know that
[2:52:48] everything has worked for months and
[2:52:51] months and months after that one message
[2:52:53] moving up to come to that place that was
[2:52:57] a Capon of time of it and he said I
[2:53:00] believe with all the messages I ever
[2:53:02] brought that was absolute was ordained
[2:53:05] of God outside court surrender
[2:53:08] Commission like the seven seals and
[2:53:10] things that was directly the Word of God
[2:53:12] I'm talking about a message to preach I
[2:53:14] believe that one was it see the one
[2:53:17] that's needed to follow the seven seals
[2:53:23] now watch that would come after the
[2:53:26] seven seals are uniting their people
[2:53:28] you're not in signs a red light flashing
[2:53:30] and like that last day sign of women
[2:53:32] getting prettier and what men what they
[2:53:34] would do all these signs of the Holy
[2:53:36] Spirit leading up and then come right
[2:53:38] back here the capping off of all those
[2:53:41] messages since the seven seals it's all
[2:53:44] capped off in this one thing the token
[2:53:48] that we're all right see just checked
[2:53:52] ourselves and see that we're in the
[2:53:55] faith now I want to get something to the
[2:53:57] one that's needed to follow the seven
[2:54:01] seals the token the sign that the Holy
[2:54:05] Ghost the life of the blood has been
[2:54:08] applied to our life is what has been
[2:54:10] needed come on now after nearly forty

[2:58:43] thinking where sin makes you sick that
[2:58:50] it's not appealing anymore
[2:58:55] there's no attraction anymore and it
[2:59:00] ain't somebody standing over your
[2:59:01] shoulder or preacher beating you over
[2:59:03] the head or subtle all that is being
[2:59:06] applied to you of some legalistic affair
[2:59:10] it's the Holy Ghost that will keep you
[2:59:13] in the hour of temptation Alleluia amen
[2:59:22] you talk about you talk about a move of
[2:59:26] the Holy Ghost we saw young people with
[2:59:28] Gameboy videos stacked up with thousands
[2:59:31] of dollars worth all their gods and
[2:59:34] their idols and their wasted years
[2:59:38] wasted lives and then take them and beat
[2:59:42] them into smithereens and burn with fire
[2:59:45] I'd rather burn them with fire than to
[2:59:48] burn with fire man but you see again you
[2:59:55] see what we want today we want something
[2:59:58] we can come up to the altar and spend a
[3:00:00] few minutes here and get one and done we
[3:00:06] just want to experience at the altar and
[3:00:09] then just go about our lives as usual
[3:00:14] [Music]
[3:00:16] you see I want to get it to you it's
[3:00:19] more than the initial striking of the
[3:00:21] blood a man it's more are you with me
[3:00:27] it's more than just taking faith and
[3:00:30] applying the holy is here and here and
[3:00:32] here but it's that you are behind that
[3:00:35] blood and you come in fellowship and you
[3:00:40] enter into Passover
[3:00:43] hallelujah where you are keeping a feast
[3:00:46] with the Lord there's a fellowship going
[3:00:50] on there's a communion and no it's not
[3:00:55] just on Sunday morning or Sunday night
[3:00:58] it's every day of your life never you
[3:01:03] never get out of Passover and in the
[3:01:09] Passover you take the whole lamb I hate
[3:01:16] that caught put up a calendar hey man
[3:01:19] you see you see he would take the whole
[3:01:22] lamb don't don't cut of it don't don't
[3:01:26] cut it apart the Baptist's only won't
[3:01:29] their favorite part
[3:01:30] that's all they won't for Passover the
[3:01:34] Methodists takes another part but this
[3:01:37] Passover must be nothing rejected the
[3:01:41] whole land a man nothing excluded
[3:01:48] nothing separated
[3:01:50] nothing pulled apart not a bone of it
[3:01:54] broken the whole lamb real Passover
[3:01:59] isn't your just your favorite quotes or
[3:02:03] your favorite scriptures a man or your
[3:02:07] favorite preacher real Passover is
[3:02:11] eating the whole lamb don't break it
[3:02:17] apart and roast it with fire are you
[3:02:24] with me a man in order to really have
[3:02:26] Passover you gotta have a fire in your
[3:02:29] dwelling hallelujah and to get a fire in
[3:02:33] your dwelling you've got a have you've
[3:02:35] got out the word of the Word of God and
[3:02:38] you gotta have it lit with a fiery
[3:02:42] experience let's set you on fire
[3:02:49] hallelujah Lord and God there's got to
[3:02:52] be a fire leaping and roaring around
[3:02:56] that lamb can I tell you the fire must
[3:03:00] touch the word and bring it to the right
[3:03:03] temperature where is done well prepared
[3:03:10] hallelujah amen the Bible said don't eat
[3:03:14] it raw is that right heat not a bit
[3:03:17] wrong or sudden at all with water but
[3:03:20] roast with fire his head his legs and
[3:03:24] with the pertinence thereof now there
[3:03:27] are some parts that ain't as desirable
[3:03:29] as other parts but in Passover you take
[3:03:32] it all
[3:03:35] hey man it's the head all the way to the
[3:03:39] tail it's the feet it's everything they
[3:03:45] would take there from what I understand
[3:03:47] it would put a skewer from head to tail
[3:03:50] then they would put another skewer and
[3:03:52] open up the cavity to expose it to the
[3:03:54] fire and it would go through this way a
[3:03:56] perfect cross and then they would roast
[3:04:00] it over the fire turning every part of
[3:04:04] it around the fire to get it on and
[3:04:09] that's what's a matter with a lot of our
[3:04:11] churches today we're not getting the
[3:04:13] fire of the Holy Ghost around the word
[3:04:15] and it's too wrong for the people to
[3:04:20] really get any benefit out of it many
[3:04:24] times it's just a cold Creed we're not
[3:04:30] getting it hot enough mmm but build up
[3:04:33] that fire amen we're not getting the
[3:04:39] fire the Holy Ghost surround the word
[3:04:41] and it's just too raw a man but build it
[3:04:46] up amen I let the flames of the Holy
[3:04:50] Ghost wrap itself around that word until
[3:04:54] the juices are running out
[3:04:59] hallelujah
[3:05:00] glory to God Oh hallelujah hey man
[3:05:07] that's what we need we need the fire
[3:05:11] come around that word until the juice is
[3:05:14] the line for the lamb just starts
[3:05:17] bubbling out of the world
[3:05:19] [Applause]
[3:05:25] lelou yeah ah ah but dead preachers give
[3:05:30] out dead sermons and dead sermons killed
[3:05:32] I don't serve it sodden with water amen
[3:05:40] because then you can soak the lamb into
[3:05:42] the lamb any kind of doctor and the
[3:05:44] flavor that you want so don't boil it in
[3:05:48] water it is to be flavored by the fire
[3:05:54] hallelujah amen you must realise how
[3:05:58] danger it is to misconstrue the word in
[3:06:02] time evangelism brother Brendan said we
[3:06:04] find out at the beginning when the
[3:06:06] messenger was sent to misconstrue his
[3:06:08] word or to doubt one word it was Total
[3:06:11] Annihilation
[3:06:11] and eternal separation from God then
[3:06:14] misconstrue that messengers word Eden
[3:06:17] saw eating saw the sudden lamb soaked in
[3:06:21] water with all kinds of additions of
[3:06:25] wild gourds that flavor the meat mixing
[3:06:29] the word with intellectual ideas of man
[3:06:32] the first thing you know we got death in
[3:06:35] the pot
[3:06:36] and this is added 11 back to the
[3:06:40] Passover meal and it leaves the people
[3:06:43] vulnerable to the death angel a man it
[3:06:48] makes a bunch of carnal believers like
[3:06:50] lot who barely escaped the burning of
[3:06:53] the tribulation I had and yeah God can
[3:06:56] use lots in here they're like coins in
[3:06:58] his hands and God uses pennies but
[3:07:00] friends our message is not to collect
[3:07:02] pennies our message is to get that
[3:07:06] silver dollar 100% Word of God Alleluia

[3:07:37] it's our freedom to kill our babies you
[3:07:44] know why but you know why would women
[3:07:45] want to do that you know why the
[3:07:46] application for abortion is because
[3:07:49] we're living in fornication so if they
[3:07:53] decide not to marry this man they just
[3:07:55] kill his baby and there won't be
[3:07:57] obligated to him - nothing John oh yeah

[3:08:39] women actively seek out pornography ah
[3:08:44] and we're meeting it in prayer lines
[3:08:49] we're meeting it you know in and lives
[3:08:54] are being wrecked and homes are being
[3:08:56] wrecked hey man we got men are just as
[3:09:02] worthless as they can be spending hours

[3:09:10] animate something another and playing
[3:09:13] with these things and sex subjects and
[3:09:15] murder and every time the other vice and
[3:09:17] feeding on that instead of feeding on

[3:09:53] subject to God a man that he that's born
[3:09:57] of God that not commit sin and there is
[3:10:00] therefore now no condemnation took them
[3:10:03] that are in Christ Jesus for their walk
[3:10:06] not after the flesh but after the spirit

[3:10:15] moves in you your body quickly turns to
[3:10:18] it whatever the Holy Ghost says hey man
[3:10:22] it's the unleavened bread of Christ and
[3:10:24] it makes you to live a holy life amen
[3:10:29] oh yeah death is in the land we got
[3:10:32] California lawmakers recently passed a
[3:10:35] measure forcing pastor to embrace the
[3:10:37] LGBTQ theology you're facing it in your
[3:10:40] skills you're facing it everywhere
[3:10:43] you're facing on the job we're seeing
[3:10:46] the nation is turning quickly from lamb
[3:10:48] to lion our dark are to dragon are you
[3:10:51] with me
[3:10:53] man and those that are left behind in
[3:10:55] this Exodus will be hunted down and
[3:10:57] slaughtered and then we got churches
[3:11:01] under attack they're dying
[3:11:03] there's lethargy lukewarm age has
[3:11:05] altered the mind of the people did you
[3:11:08] know dulling their senses and America
[3:11:11] the religious nation of America over a
[3:11:14] hundred a day will close across America
[3:11:17] only to be left to skeleton of a
[3:11:19] building with no people and even now the
[3:11:25] youth are gone
[3:11:27] uninterested in what they have to offer
[3:11:29] the death angel is bringing sin and
[3:11:32] sodomy and perversion and abortions and
[3:11:37] I've had message people write me write
[3:11:45] me and say brother Tim this is our third
[3:11:48] child and we can't afford it would it be
[3:11:51] all right to abort it and I hit delete
[3:11:59] because you're not worth
[3:12:04] [Applause]
[3:12:14] God's gonna have a people that are
[3:12:17] filled with the spirit that are walking
[3:12:19] in the world a man are you with me
[3:12:23] recently a message youth conference
[3:12:25] there they they announced where they
[3:12:28] they were gonna have a Youth Conference
[3:12:29] because they're there they're kids who
[3:12:31] are young people were eat up with
[3:12:33] pornography and homosexual and all these
[3:12:35] things and said and they said and and
[3:12:38] you know we we reject the thought if you
[3:12:41] just get the Holy Ghost that fixes it
[3:12:43] and I'd say you know what that's because
[3:12:50] they ain't never got the Holy Ghost they
[3:12:53] don't know what it is and then because
[3:12:57] when the Holy Ghost comes it'll make a
[3:12:59] man be a real man a woman be a real
[3:13:02] woman make a real lady out of her that's
[3:13:07] what the only ghosts will do it or take
[3:13:10] pornography and sin and evil all these
[3:13:13] things out of your life oh yeah
[3:13:20] and then we see those that have been
[3:13:22] solid in the faith for years look like
[3:13:24] pillars in the church now rejecting the
[3:13:27] truth and living sordid sinful
[3:13:29] conditions are you with me now hey man
[3:13:35] oh but we're predestinate oh yeah we
[3:13:37] believe we're predestinated we believe
[3:13:39] God's gonna pick us up in the rapture
[3:13:41] and clean this up and without any effort
[3:13:42] or desire on our own to do it you must
[3:13:47] come under the blood and it must be more
[3:13:50] than getting the blood on your flesh and
[3:13:52] you quit cutting your hair and paint in
[3:13:53] your face and smoke it it must be more
[3:13:56] than getting in your spirit realm and
[3:13:58] having your memory and your senses
[3:14:00] purged it brings you into intimate
[3:14:02] fellowship where you eat the lamb and
[3:14:05] the bread unleavened there's a soberness
[3:14:11] but in the midst of that soberness and
[3:14:14] then bringing it down to close now hang
[3:14:17] on just for a few minutes there was a
[3:14:21] soberness yet the same time there was a
