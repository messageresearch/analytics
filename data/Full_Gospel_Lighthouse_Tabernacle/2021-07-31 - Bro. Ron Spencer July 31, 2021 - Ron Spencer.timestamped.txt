[1:13:10] night and uh they kind of hinted at me
[1:13:13] on Monday that was going to go on and I
[1:13:15] begin to look at notes and just nothing
[1:13:18] seemed to to speak to my heart you know
[1:13:21] notes are powerful but you need
[1:13:23] inspiration and so I looked and I looked
[1:13:26] and I looked and Tuesday I looked and
[1:13:29] Wednesday morning I was starting to get
[1:13:32] desperate nothing seemed to come we were
[1:13:35] preparing to go to the church early
[1:13:37] after visiting sister Karen going to
[1:13:40] have a time of just a little bit of rest
[1:13:42] before the service and sister Connie was
[1:13:44] able to lay down and I was I was

[1:13:48] couldn't lay down knowing that I needed
[1:13:50] something for for for that evening
[1:13:54] and so I was I was just sitting there
[1:13:56] and I was just praying I said Lord I
[1:13:59] need you to speak to my heart so tonight
[1:14:02] I want to speak part two of Wednesday
[1:14:05] night on this attack it's of the

[1:14:50] forever amen amen the angel told Mary
[1:14:56] when he was giv her the
[1:14:58] salutation for with
[1:15:01] God nothing shall be
[1:15:04] impossible can we say that together
[1:15:06] tonight full with God nothing shall be
[1:15:11] impossible let's say it again for with
[1:15:14] God nothing shall be impossible you may
[1:15:18] be seated this
[1:15:21] evening Isaiah chap 59 and verse
[1:15:25] 1 behold the Lord's hand is not
[1:15:30] shortened what powerful
[1:15:32] words that it cannot save neither his
[1:15:37] ear heavy that it cannot
[1:15:40] hear verse
[1:15:42] 19 so they fear the name of the Lord
[1:15:46] from the West and his glory from the
[1:15:49] rising of the sun when the enemy shall
[1:15:54] come in like a flood now notice he's
[1:15:56] going to
[1:15:58] come he have his absolute right to
[1:16:02] come but now you have a response the
[1:16:05] spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[1:16:09] standard against
[1:16:12] him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion
[1:16:16] and unto them that turn from
[1:16:18] transgression in Jacob sayeth the Lord
[1:16:21] as for me this is my Covenant with them
[1:16:24] sayith the Lord my spirit is upon thee
[1:16:27] and my words which I have put in thy
[1:16:30] mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth
[1:16:33] nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out
[1:16:36] of the mouth of thy seed seed sayth the
[1:16:40] Lord from henceforth and
[1:16:45] forever brother brandom said this in a
[1:16:48] very short statement he said
[1:16:51] shamgar said I I am sick and tired of
[1:16:57] it every year the enemy
[1:17:00] came every year the enemy took most of
[1:17:04] his crop and only left him enough to
[1:17:06] survive on every year the enemy attack
[1:17:09] him and it would be about 600 men that
[1:17:12] would come armed soldiers that would
[1:17:14] come not just Jamar but people around
[1:17:18] even other seed of God but shamgar
[1:17:22] realized one day that he was a Son of
[1:17:25] God because remember God himself had
[1:17:30] said as MDC and as he sat there that day
[1:17:34] and he spoke to Abraham and he told him
[1:17:37] that thy seed shall possess the gates of
[1:17:39] her enemy if you remember where that
[1:17:42] actually was spoken he spoke that to
[1:17:45] Abraham after he was coming
[1:17:48] down from from offering Isaac his son
[1:17:52] amen
[1:17:54] God because of the
[1:17:56] victory Abraham's
[1:17:59] Victory God give him a
[1:18:02] promise that we as the children of God
[1:18:06] would possess the gates of our
[1:18:09] [Applause]
[1:18:12] enemy sir you brother
[1:18:15] Hallelujah he said I'm sick and tired of
[1:18:18] it I'm not a warrior the odds is against
[1:18:22] me no matter how much odds is against
[1:18:25] you God's for
[1:18:29] you if you take him at his
[1:18:32] word
[1:18:35] hallall sakaran is laying like a like a
[1:18:38] vegetable even now about nonresponsive
[1:18:41] for about the last 12 days other some
[1:18:44] than some twitches and those kinds of
[1:18:47] things brother Timothy sent me
[1:18:50] this on on Thursday we were in the room
[1:18:54] with sister Karen and and there was
[1:18:56] about 10 of us there we were in the room
[1:18:59] and as I slipped around and we were
[1:19:01] having prayer I sensed the presence of
[1:19:04] the
[1:19:04] Lord and I I I just shared with Timothy
[1:19:08] later that that the presence of the Lord
[1:19:11] seemed to be at the top of the
[1:19:13] bed and brother Timothy slipped around
[1:19:17] the bed and he said he could just feel
[1:19:18] him there we had already slipped away
[1:19:21] and we were going and we were we were
[1:19:24] moving out and and and uh I found it
[1:19:28] interesting
[1:19:30] that Esther was at the foot of the
[1:19:34] bed and his brother Timothy was standing
[1:19:36] there filled in that presence that
[1:19:38] presence moved and went right over top
[1:19:41] of Esther and Esther be to
[1:19:45] shout we're not alone in our
[1:19:48] battle when we're facing death and we're
[1:19:51] facing
[1:19:53] uncertain situations that lay just ahead
[1:19:56] of us we don't know what to do God's
[1:19:58] Sovereign in every situation but he
[1:20:00] makes a promise to us and it's still the
[1:20:03] same today I'll never leave
[1:20:07] you I'll never forsake you I'll be with
[1:20:11] you to the end of the
[1:20:13] [Applause]
[1:20:17] world Timothy sent me this note today
[1:20:19] and I believe it's appropriate for the
[1:20:21] moment he said I'd been in there and
[1:20:24] been by her bed talking to
[1:20:27] her and i' had left to get Andrew he's
[1:20:29] not quite
[1:20:32] 18 but close enough he said that had
[1:20:35] been really close to him and
[1:20:38] Mom and and I got to talking to the
[1:20:41] receptionist and when I when I walked in
[1:20:45] brother Matt Dexter who is brother
[1:20:48] Michael Dexter's father was praying and
[1:20:51] you could feel the atmosphere that was
[1:20:53] in the
[1:20:54] room after he prayed we sang a little
[1:20:57] bit and the nurse came in to move uh
[1:21:01] sister Karen so we all went out and
[1:21:04] after a bit dad called us to the room
[1:21:06] for a prayer before we left and I walked
[1:21:09] around around her bed to where we stood
[1:21:12] the other day and I'd already been there
[1:21:14] earlier and I felt nothing but this
[1:21:19] time always like that but this time
[1:21:23] on this time I walked around and I felt
[1:21:26] such a presence till my knees started
[1:21:28] buckling I had to grab the bed to stay
[1:21:31] up it was totally
[1:21:36] unexpected almost an hour later he would
[1:21:39] say that his knees were still weak from
[1:21:41] that
[1:21:42] presence what an awesome
[1:21:45] God when it's out of doctor hands and
[1:21:48] out of humans hands it's in the hands of
[1:21:51] God
[1:21:53] and God has a
[1:21:55] response yeah come on are you with me

[1:22:48] us shoulder toos shoulder if you
[1:22:51] remember brother br and I just feel led
[1:22:53] to say this brother brandham as he was
[1:22:55] had his had his name called in that
[1:22:57] dream and he's walking and he hears his
[1:23:00] name William maram brandom and he begins
[1:23:02] to walk up up those steps toward Heaven
[1:23:05] he said I felt something under my
[1:23:08] arm it was sister hope and then it was
[1:23:11] Sister meia walking into that real with
[1:23:14] [Applause]
[1:23:17] you thank you Lord Brother said George
[1:23:20] Washington was persistent at Valley
[1:23:23] Forge all the odds was against him the
[1:23:26] enemy was across the river but after all
[1:23:30] night in prayer
[1:23:33] right and the American soldiers with no
[1:23:36] shoes on their feet about onethird of
[1:23:39] them had shoes and they crossed the
[1:23:41] river at Valley Forge through the ice
[1:23:44] and and the three musket bullet holes
[1:23:47] went through his coat but he had an
[1:23:50] answer from God I love that
[1:23:53] but he had an answer from God and there
[1:23:55] was no need of him backing down there's
[1:23:58] no need of us backing down
[1:24:01] tonight nothing could stop him then he
[1:24:05] crossed it because he was persistent he
[1:24:09] had heard from
[1:24:11] God and that's the way that we've got to
[1:24:14] be if God said so that settles
[1:24:19] it Daniel 12 and verse one and at that
[1:24:23] time shall Michael raise up stand up
[1:24:26] that great Prince which standeth for the
[1:24:28] children of my people and there shall be
[1:24:31] a time of trouble such as never since
[1:24:34] there
[1:24:35] was as a nation even to the same same
[1:24:39] time at the time of the people shall be
[1:24:42] delivered everyone shall be found
[1:24:45] written in the book I'm in that book and
[1:24:48] many of them that asleep in the dust the
[1:24:51] Earth shall awake
[1:24:52] some to everlasting life and some to
[1:24:55] shame and everlasting contempt but they
[1:24:58] that be
[1:25:01] wise shall shine as the brightness of
[1:25:04] the
[1:25:05] fent they shall turn of many to
[1:25:09] righteousness as stars forever and ever
[1:25:12] brother BR said every word of God is a
[1:25:15] seed and it must be that seed can be
[1:25:18] planted by the

[1:27:46] leading him to a
[1:27:48] victory for this great nation was with

[1:30:52] amounted to anything at any time through
[1:30:54] any age has been men who believed in God
[1:30:58] and had faith in God and stood against
[1:31:01] the enemy on every
[1:31:04] side do you remember brother brandom had
[1:31:07] a vision it was tucked in his in his
[1:31:09] Bible and many people had wrote it out
[1:31:11] across the world about a vision of a
[1:31:14] little Finnish boy that had been hit by
[1:31:17] a
[1:31:17] car actually two boys were hit but that
[1:31:20] little boy had been hit by a car and he
[1:31:23] was dead and he was laying there bones
[1:31:25] sticking actually through his skin and
[1:31:28] he was laying there in a very morbid
[1:31:30] condition and God reminded him that that
[1:31:33] was the little boy the trees the
[1:31:35] soldiers the
[1:31:38] surroundings the people and when he
[1:31:41] realized that that was the vision and it
[1:31:43] was about to be
[1:31:47] fulfilled are you with me now listen I'm
[1:31:50] just going to fire paraphrase it for you
[1:31:53] he said you could have lined up every
[1:31:54] devil in
[1:31:58] hell you could have lined up every devil
[1:32:01] in hell and nothing was going to stop it
[1:32:04] from
[1:32:08] happening
[1:32:10] Hallelujah Satan has to witness that
[1:32:12] that's the
[1:32:14] truth he has to witness that that's the
[1:32:17] truth I'd say this to you the Rapture is
[1:32:20] getting ready to happen the
[1:32:21] resurrection's getting ready to happen
[1:32:24] all hell can't stop
[1:32:28] it oh hell can't stop
[1:32:31] it we were listening on our way to
[1:32:33] service this afternoon on what is the
[1:32:35] attraction of the
[1:32:37] mountain and uh we were we come to the
[1:32:40] part where brother brandham begins to
[1:32:42] talk about the events that happened in
[1:32:44] Arizona and he talks about the The Sword
[1:32:48] in the
[1:32:49] hand and he talks about when the Angels
[1:32:52] Came and and they came in a
[1:32:54] constellation and he said and they
[1:32:57] formed that that Wick and as they
[1:33:01] ascended up they formed a that wig that
[1:33:03] cloud said that cloud was made of angels
[1:33:06] wings and and he says and then later he
[1:33:10] would say that the angel the angel of
[1:33:12] the Lord told him to turn the picture
[1:33:14] right and there was
[1:33:16] Jesus and as I was sitting there brother
[1:33:19] R would after a while he begins to say
[1:33:22] now what was
[1:33:24] prophecy now it's
[1:33:27] history now what was prophecy now is
[1:33:32] history some of those things were
[1:33:34] foretold that they would
[1:33:38] happen since as brother brandom having a
[1:33:41] dream about the his gate how that when
[1:33:44] that gate would be they would tear down
[1:33:47] the gate and tear down tear up his front
[1:33:49] yard and the drive there and actually in
[1:33:52] the dream brother R sees himself hitting
[1:33:55] this man and he was a real smart Alec
[1:33:57] and he hit him and he hit him and he hit
[1:33:59] him he picked him up and hid him again
[1:34:01] and the angel told him said when you see
[1:34:03] this happening when they drive that
[1:34:05] steak down you avoid this am and go
[1:34:09] west and so and so when brother Brown
[1:34:12] sees that he goes west then he finds
[1:34:14] himself sitting there with a cocko bear
[1:34:17] on his trouser legs and they're hunting
[1:34:19] for halina Hawks amen
[1:34:22] you see as we have been saying over the
[1:34:24] last few
[1:34:26] weeks prophecy intercepts with
[1:34:33] time and as a prophet he's standing
[1:34:36] there and he's just being honest and
[1:34:37] he's telling us the human part of the
[1:34:39] story and I pulled it and and I pulled
[1:34:41] it up and I pulled that c that behead
[1:34:44] off of my off of my trouser and I was
[1:34:46] looking at it and I looked up and saw
[1:34:48] those Havalina Hogs and he began to run
[1:34:51] toward toward those HS and he heard a
[1:34:53] blast that shook the Earth
[1:34:56] that's as he's in that meeting just like
[1:34:59] we're in this meeting tonight and
[1:35:05] he's and he's standing there telling
[1:35:08] three kind of
[1:35:10] Believers the real
[1:35:12] believer the make believer and the
[1:35:16] unbeliever and he's telling them about
[1:35:19] these things taking place
[1:35:22] then he comes to the end of it and he
[1:35:24] says I've told you the truth and he
[1:35:27] comes to a spot and said now let him
[1:35:30] vindicate his word if three people if he
[1:35:34] can call three people in a row he'll
[1:35:36] vindicate what I told you to be the
[1:35:40] truth I finding it interesting that this
[1:35:44] [Music]
[1:35:46] audience has been
[1:35:48] graced by Thomas Brady
[1:35:54] that was sitting in that meeting amen
[1:35:57] and heard that promises and heard the
[1:36:02] truth and immediate believed that that
[1:36:05] was a Prophet
[1:36:08] Elijah to this
[1:36:10] generation and as he's sitting there his
[1:36:14] name is
[1:36:15] called his wife's condition in
[1:36:19] Jamaica that she's wrote him a about her
[1:36:22] feet shared with you you last week about
[1:36:25] this shared with it having trouble with
[1:36:27] her feet she couldn't walk having to be
[1:36:30] in a bed she sent a letter and he opened
[1:36:33] the letter and he read it if you're with
[1:36:34] a preacher would you just would you just
[1:36:37] would you just have them to pray and he
[1:36:40] was with several preachers but he didn't
[1:36:42] feel led to have them and he held that
[1:36:44] in his coat and he and he had it there
[1:36:47] of Sister Sister Brady's request God I
[1:36:51] knew
[1:36:53] it those stories were told and we would
[1:36:57] have a witness today that we've had a
[1:36:59] man stand in the pull
[1:37:04] pit are you with me this message is more
[1:37:07] than just Miracles that's right it's
[1:37:10] more than just doctrines but it's the
[1:37:13] same Jesus yesterday today and
[1:37:20] forever
[1:37:25] I would like to say this to
[1:37:27] you Satan knows he's trying to block
[1:37:30] every visitation that he can from you
[1:37:32] from me but there's nothing that he can
[1:37:36] do to block the visitation of almighty
[1:37:40] God your case might be like Daniel where
[1:37:43] you have to wait 21 days and God has to
[1:37:47] go back and get the mighty Angel to come
[1:37:50] and fight the battle don't you worry the
[1:37:53] mighty Angel's taking your
[1:38:01] case you were healed at
[1:38:05] Calvary you were forgiven at Calvary but
[1:38:09] you've got to make your
[1:38:15] claim
[1:38:20] brother
[1:38:24] I thought about the people in
[1:38:28] China as I would stand and preach to
[1:38:30] them about two years about two hours on
[1:38:34] we must get to
[1:38:36] Jesus sitting in
[1:38:39] cold damp
[1:38:42] conditions sitting
[1:38:45] huddled they came there knowing that if
[1:38:47] they got caught by the
[1:38:50] authorities they could be arrested and
[1:38:52] go to
[1:38:53] jail two pastors are still in prison now
[1:38:57] but to be to release one in September
[1:39:00] then one in November God give his family
[1:39:03] special bless don't worry god'll repay
[1:39:05] every bit of
[1:39:08] that don't you worry about them God
[1:39:11] God's got angels to watch over
[1:39:14] them God's a great provider he he will
[1:39:17] watch over them we may never get to go
[1:39:20] back to go to China again I'm sure we
[1:39:22] won't be able ever to I ever put my feet
[1:39:25] back on that that that country again but
[1:39:28] don't you worry the seed and the message
[1:39:30] got
[1:39:32] through and there's nothing that Satan
[1:39:35] can do to block that
[1:39:44] up I was thinking as I Was preparing
[1:39:46] today how much I would wish for those
[1:39:48] people to be in this
[1:39:50] building oh if they could feel these
[1:39:53] pews
[1:39:57] tonight during the service brother
[1:39:59] Murphy Wong as the power of the word
[1:40:01] just kept dropping and wave after wave
[1:40:04] after wave and he would just drop and
[1:40:06] fall across the pull pit and I've had to
[1:40:08] wait for him to be able to come to
[1:40:11] himself to continue to
[1:40:14] preach angel of God just swirling all
[1:40:17] around in that
[1:40:18] building and I would watch I would watch
[1:40:21] old women crawl old women old men crawl
[1:40:25] all the way from the back of that
[1:40:27] building all the way to front in
[1:40:31] reverence I don't want you to crawl
[1:40:33] tonight but I want you to have reverence
[1:40:36] before
[1:40:41] God some of the most phenomenal Miracles
[1:40:43] I ever witnessed would take place that
[1:40:46] prayer line would last about 6 hours
[1:40:48] that evening not expecting anything like
[1:40:51] that tonight but I'm expecting the same
[1:40:56] angel you're you're a wonderful audience
[1:40:59] to preach to and and I love coming home
[1:41:02] to preach to a wonderful audience and
[1:41:04] you may have to be sitting in new seats
[1:41:06] for for a service or two and it's kind
[1:41:09] of like getting a new tough toothbrush
[1:41:11] you'll get you'll get it
[1:41:13] ready but I want you to know we come
[1:41:15] with one thing in our
[1:41:19] minds we come to see
[1:41:24] Jesus and maybe your need would be like
[1:41:27] the woman that would that would make her
[1:41:30] way maybe she had to craw that's right
[1:41:33] but she said if I can only touch the hym
[1:41:35] of His
[1:41:37] Garment I know I'll be made
[1:41:47] well Jesus talks about the enemy
[1:41:51] then said Jesus unto them John 10 and
[1:41:54] verse 7 verily verily I say unto you I
[1:41:58] am the door of the
[1:41:59] sheep all that ever come before me are
[1:42:03] thieves and robbers but the Sheep did
[1:42:06] not hear them I am the door by me if any
[1:42:11] man enter in he shall be saved and shall
[1:42:15] go in and out and find pasture right the
[1:42:18] thief cometh not but to steal and to
[1:42:22] kill and to
[1:42:26] destroy why would we negotiate with an
[1:42:30] enemy that all he wants to do is destroy
[1:42:33] our
[1:42:34] lives destroy our families destroy our
[1:42:41] homes are you with me today we realize
[1:42:44] that we're living in a Sodom condition
[1:42:47] and it's only getting worse and worse
[1:42:49] and worse
[1:42:52] on it's pressed upon us it's pressed on
[1:42:55] our children it's pressed in our
[1:42:59] neighborhoods but we were built to live
[1:43:01] in this age so God has overcoming power
[1:43:05] for you and I to stand like we've never
[1:43:09] stood
[1:43:18] before the thief cometh not to but for
[1:43:21] to steal and to kill and destroy but I
[1:43:23] am come that's it that they may have
[1:43:27] life and that they may have it more
[1:43:31] abundantly sure Satan will whisper in
[1:43:34] your ear but you remember there was a
[1:43:38] enemy named Goliath he made a boast one
[1:43:41] day he had made many a boast but on this
[1:43:46] day he made a boast in the wrong ears
[1:43:55] Little David turned around and said you
[1:43:57] mean to tell me that you'll stand and
[1:44:00] let that
[1:44:02] uncircumcised Philistine defy the armies
[1:44:06] of the Living God Satan does not have a
[1:44:09] problem until
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:14] somebody is built to
[1:44:19] respond
[1:44:22] his Nation his brothers his King yes sir
[1:44:28] had so much
[1:44:32] unbelief in a supernatural
[1:44:36] God don't tell me you don't believe in
[1:44:38] prayer lines
[1:44:41] preachers don't tell me you don't
[1:44:43] believe in a holy ghost that's got a
[1:44:45] real power in the side of it to
[1:44:47] transform
[1:44:49] lives
[1:44:51] those days are not pass but they're
[1:44:54] living you need to stand up with
[1:44:56] everything that's within you and believe
[1:44:59] in a supernatural
[1:45:03] God We believe We believe We
[1:45:12] believe that saying power one of these
[1:45:15] days will change our
[1:45:17] lives it'll change our bodies
[1:45:21] I don't care what the devil says come on
[1:45:24] that power can raise our bodies up
[1:45:28] [Applause]
[1:45:33] again
[1:45:35] Hallelujah but I would not have you to
[1:45:37] be ignorant Brethren concerning them
[1:45:38] which are asleep these are our
[1:45:41] promises that you sorrow not even as
[1:45:44] others which have no hope for if we
[1:45:46] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[1:45:48] even so them which sleep in Jesus Jesus
[1:45:51] will God bring with
[1:45:52] him our loved ones are step from that
[1:45:55] realm and we'll take a half a step that
[1:45:57] way and they'll take a half a step this
[1:45:59] way it don't matter what the critic says
[1:46:02] on that
[1:46:09] day they'll have three and a half years
[1:46:11] to think about
[1:46:13] that for the Lord shall descend from
[1:46:15] heaven with a shout and with the voice
[1:46:17] of the Archangel and with the Trump of
[1:46:20] God the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:46:22] then we which are alive and
[1:46:25] remain shall be caught up together with
[1:46:28] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[1:46:30] the air and so shall we ever be with the
[1:46:35] Lord Brother Ron I don't know if I've
[1:46:37] heard from God you just
[1:46:39] did you just heard from God I don't know
[1:46:42] how to say it any clear and then he says
[1:46:44] wherefore Comfort one another with these
[1:46:49] words
[1:46:54] and I saw a new
[1:46:56] Heaven and I saw a new Earth for the
[1:46:59] first Earth Heaven and the first Earth
[1:47:01] were passed away and there was no more
[1:47:03] sea and I John saw the holy city the New
[1:47:06] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:47:08] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:47:11] her husband and I heard a great voice
[1:47:13] out of Heaven saying behold the
[1:47:15] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[1:47:17] will dwell with them and they shall be
[1:47:19] his people
[1:47:25] that's who we are sir and every nation
[1:47:29] has heard this
[1:47:37] message God himself shall be with them
[1:47:41] and be their God and God shall wipe away
[1:47:44] all
[1:47:45] tears from their
[1:47:48] eyes Satan I want you to listen to this
[1:47:50] scripture RT as I
[1:47:55] quoted there shall be no more
[1:47:58] death that bee that's trying to whirl
[1:48:01] around sister Karen right
[1:48:03] now there shall be no more
[1:48:06] death neither
[1:48:10] sorrow nor crying neither shall be any
[1:48:14] more
[1:48:15] pain for the former
[1:48:19] things pass
[1:48:22] away brother Ron that's just hard to
[1:48:25] believe some of you were drunks some of

[1:49:04] day they said there's no rain up there
[1:49:07] just stick around long
[1:49:08] enough then Jesus came and he bled on
[1:49:11] the cross and those blood drops left his
[1:49:15] body and he redeemed this sin cursed
[1:49:19] Earth
[1:49:21] and it's going to take his bride off of
[1:49:24] the
[1:49:26] earth and he going to remake it with a
