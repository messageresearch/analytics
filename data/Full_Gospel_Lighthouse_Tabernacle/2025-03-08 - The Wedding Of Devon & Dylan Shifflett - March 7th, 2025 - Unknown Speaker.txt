h h for [Music] that's right [Music] [Music] hey bu [Music] [Music] could we [Music] stand you may be SE [Music] I would like to thank each and every one of you today for coming to brother Dylan and sister Devon's wedding today and what a beautiful setting that we have for most of us here we know the miracle of all of this of the supernatural hand of God that has watched over their lives and brought them together we watch God God is a god of a living God he's a miracle working God and if you say well brother Ron I would really like to see a miracle today is what we have here without a lot of explanation this is a wedding of new beginnings and so I am honored as the pastor here to do this wonderful wedding today so I wish you both both congratulations today amen let's talk to the Lord Lord Jesus we love you with all of our hearts and now we ask you that you would just come two people can come and clasp hands exchange vows but it takes you to make us one now father we ask you that you would watch over this wedding bless each person that has come today bless Dylan and Devon bless their home father I pray that you would bless their families here today and all of us want to know you more and so we invite you to come close to us today we ask you in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen God is the author of love the Bible teaches us that God is love and that love comes from God from from the beginning to the end the Bible is a love story there we read of God's love for his people he sent Christ to cross for his redeeming love for us as a sinner and the Abiding Love for his redeemed we also read of the love of a man and a woman Jacob love for Rachel Mary was pledged to Joseph and the shulamite to her beloved in the beginning when God created and formed the heavens and the Earth he formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground placed him in the Garden of Eden but just like God Adam was lonely so God came and caused a deep sleep to come upon Adam and he took a rib out of him Adam had saw all kinds of animals had enjoyed all their their company but today was going to be different God was going to form a helpmate for him just like your eyes as you turned and looked here just a few moments ago I can imagine what Adam looked at when he saw Eve what a wonderful day that it was so God performed the first marriage in the Garden of Eden now God brings us to our life's companion and Abraham prayed that God would find a wife for his son and Isaac and God remembered that prayer and when Abraham's servant found Rebecca the servant bowed and worshiped praising God and he brought her to the master's son and the scripture said that Isaac loved her and was comforted Devon Dylan it's just like our walk with Jesus Christ we start our walk and God asked us to take on his name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the longer that we serve him the more he feels our life and the more he feels our life the more like him we will become now you may not believe this but if you could look around the room there's couple sitting here that's been married 40 50 years maybe even 60 years and after a while they'll even start thinking one another's thoughts and finishing one another's sentences and and know the mistakes of each other you guys are going to do that what you laugh about it with your mom and dad you're going to do it so today is the new beginning for you I rehearsed this with Dylan last night and so it's no news to him but today is the last day of his life that he's going to be right it's a true statement to too I want you to understand that God has guided you Dylan and guided you Devon to this moment has blessed your love and brought you together and now we'll enter into the Covenant of the Holy Union of marriage Dylan will have will you have

oldest ceremony in the world it is celebrated in the beginning of the presence of God marriage is the gift of God given to comfort the Sorrows of life and to magnify its Joys marriage is the clasping of hands and blending of Hearts the union of two lives as becoming one your marriage must stand not by the authority of the state nor by the seal that is going to be on your wedding certificate but rather it must stand by the strength of Your Love It Must Stand by Your Devotion to one another in good times and in bad times finally it must stand because God's participation in your relationship the word of God tells us that love this is what love does if I speak with the tongues of men and angels but I have not love I am only a a sounding brass and a s tinkling symbol if I have the gift of Prophecy and cannot fathom mysteries in the knowledge if I have the faith that can move mountains but I have not love I am nothing if I give all that I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the Flames but if I have not love I have nothing this is the good part love is patient love is kind it does not envy it does not boast it is not proud it is not rude it is not self-seeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs it keeps no record of wrongs it keeps no record of wrongs love love does not Delight in evil but rejoices the truth it always protects it always trust it always hopes and it always preserves God bless you can you repeat this vow with me I D and take you Devon i d and take you Dev to be my wife to be my wife to heaven to hold to heaven to hold from this
