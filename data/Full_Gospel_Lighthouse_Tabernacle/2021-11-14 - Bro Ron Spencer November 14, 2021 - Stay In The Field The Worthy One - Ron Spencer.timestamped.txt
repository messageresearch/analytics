[46:06] and seems to call us about every day and
[46:09] and so but we thankful to have a higher
[46:11] physician that
[46:12] says i got this and so
[46:14] amen
[46:16] isn't he good to us
[46:18] amen i'm forgetting something and i'm
[46:20] amen
[46:23] well i'll just go to this we have a
[46:25] baptismal service on november the 27th
[46:29] and the 28th weekend that will be
[46:32] we'll have it on that sunday but we will
[46:35] be two weeks from now and so
[46:37] if you're if you have not been baptized
[46:40] it's one of the things that you must do
[46:43] and so make sure you get that taken care
[46:45] of i can't do it for you and so we're
[46:47] not we're not mormons we don't we don't
[46:49] baptize for the dead and so you got to
[46:51] do that that's one of the things and
[46:53] remember this to have your sins remitted
[46:56] you must be baptized and so that's acts
[46:59] chapter 2 and verse 38 and so
[47:02] want to get that taken care of in your
[47:04] life don't wait till you get on death's
[47:05] door and try to make it way through
[47:07] another way if you've got you've got

[47:11] repent
[47:13] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[47:15] jesus christ for the remission of your
[47:18] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[47:19] the holy ghost
[47:21] there's only one baptism that's given
[47:22] there in the scriptures and that's the
[47:24] way that they were baptized in the name
[47:26] of jesus christ
[47:27] not in the titles of father son holy
[47:29] ghost that's a catholic teaching and so
[47:31] if you've been baptized in a catholic
[47:33] teaching make sure that you
[47:35] i'm not going to ask every one of you
[47:37] have you been baptized the right way if
[47:39] you have not been baptized in the name
[47:42] of the lord jesus christ we want to get
[47:43] that done amen
[47:46] we want to get that done
[47:48] i'm not going to hammer you but that's a
[47:49] scriptural promise and to see the
[47:52] opening of the word you got to step
[47:54] through some doors to get through it and
[47:55] so
[47:56] amen there was a day she was just a
[47:58] girlfriend but today she's the queen so
[48:02] amen good to be queen in it

[49:35] he has many more of those days to share
[49:37] with you
[49:39] amen in the season of my life i've
[49:41] learned that i'm not promised tomorrow
[49:44] so i must enjoy this day
[49:47] many times we're looking for miracles
[49:49] that
[49:50] that are
[49:51] almost hollywood-like but let me just
[49:54] say today is a miracle that we share
[49:57] together so let's enjoy this day if we
[50:00] can do that
[50:01] today we want to speak on the worthy one
[50:09] we want to speak on the worthy one no
[50:12] man no prophet
[50:14] was willing to pay the price
[50:19] no man was willing to pay the price
[50:22] but our lord jesus was not ashamed of
[50:24] her past
[50:26] and he was willing to buy back our
[50:28] redemption
[50:29] for that we begin this morning
[50:31] revelations chapter 5
[50:34] and this is a very important
[50:36] passage for the message believers and i
[50:38] saw in the saw in the right hand of him
[50:41] that set on the throne a book written
[50:43] within and on the backside sealed with
[50:46] seven seals
[50:47] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[50:50] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[50:52] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[50:55] and no man in heaven nor in earth
[50:58] neither under the earth was able to open
[51:01] the book neither to look thereon
[51:03] and i wept much
[51:05] because no man was found worthy to open
[51:07] the book and to read neither to look
[51:10] thereon
[51:11] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[51:14] not behold the lion of the tribe of
[51:16] judah the root of david hath prevailed
[51:19] to open the book and to loose the seven
[51:21] seals thereof and i beheld and low in
[51:23] the midst of the throne of the four
[51:25] beasts and the midst of the elders stood
[51:28] a lamb as it has been slain having seven
[51:31] horns
[51:32] seven eyes which are the spirits of god
[51:35] sent forth into all the earth
[51:37] and he came and he took the book out of
[51:39] the right hand of him that sat on the
[51:41] throne and when he had taken the book
[51:43] the four beasts and the four and twenty
[51:45] elders fell down before the lamb having
[51:48] every one of them hearts and golden
[51:50] vials full of odors which are the
[51:52] prayers of the saints
[51:54] now here is what we do
[51:56] and they sung a new song
[51:59] our song is a song of redemption
[52:03] thou art worthy to take the book and to
[52:06] open the seals thereof for thou was
[52:08] slain and redeemed us to god by the
[52:12] blood out of every kindred tongue and
[52:15] people and nation and has made us unto
[52:18] our god
[52:19] kings and priests and we shall reign
[52:23] on the earth
[52:25] let's pray lord jesus we love you today
[52:28] we thank you to stand here before this
[52:30] awesome audience we pray that you would
[52:33] bless them in a supernatural way anoint
[52:36] your servant of god to speak the words
[52:38] of life strengthen us father touch my
[52:41] body this evening father we ask you that
[52:43] you administer to us may the word go to
[52:46] its direct spot
[52:48] now we ask you to minister to brother
[52:50] harold we pray as a body of believers
[52:55] when doctors have done all that they can
[52:57] do
[52:58] that's when jesus takes over
[53:00] father you're our high priest you're
[53:03] you're the intercessor you're the great
[53:05] one that paid the price of redemption
[53:08] you took those stripes at paula's
[53:10] judgment hall that we could be healed we
[53:14] believe there's still purpose in brother
[53:15] harold's life and we ask you to raise
[53:18] him up to fulfill that purpose
[53:20] in jesus christ's name we pray and the
[53:23] the bride of christ says amen you can be
[53:26] seated
[53:32] hebrews chapter 1 kind of says it and
[53:35] describes it all for us
[53:38] god who at sun dry times and divers
[53:40] manners spake us to spake in times past
[53:44] unto the fathers by the prophets
[53:47] so each one of those prophets was an
[53:50] attribute being displayed on the earth
[53:52] whether it was joseph whether it was
[53:55] jonah whether it was nehemiah or nahum
[53:58] or micah
[53:59] all of those prophets moses being one of
[54:02] the most standout men all of those
[54:05] prophets were a display of what god
[54:08] wanted to say to the bride of christ of
[54:11] that day
[54:13] and so people had to realize this is our
[54:16] prophet
[54:18] this is god's mouthpiece to us
[54:21] now notice
[54:23] god just didn't stop once moses's
[54:25] message was over or once noah's message
[54:28] was over it was pushing forward to a
[54:32] messiah
[54:34] because moses couldn't die for his sins
[54:37] nehemiah could not die for his sins
[54:40] because remember we're all under adam's
[54:44] curse
[54:46] when they walked out of the garden of
[54:48] eden it was god that called them back
[54:52] and took sheepskins
[54:55] something had to die
[54:57] to cover them
[54:59] and god made a covenant with adam that
[55:02] he would restore him
[55:04] now what adam stepped out of he stepped
[55:07] out of an eternal realm
[55:09] into a time realm
[55:14] and what we're getting ready to do is go
[55:16] from a time realm
[55:20] to an eternal realm
[55:22] [Music]
[55:25] hallelujah sister sharon good to see you
[55:28] amen i'm thankful for a young lady
[55:30] that'll drive four hours to come to
[55:31] church so god bless you sister sharon
[55:34] amen now notice this hath in these last
[55:37] days spoken unto us by his son
[55:39] whom he hath appointed heir of all
[55:41] things by whom also he hath made the
[55:44] worlds who be in the brightness of his
[55:47] glory and the express image of his
[55:50] person and upholding all things unto the
[55:53] word by power which he had by himself
[55:57] purged our sins
[56:01] nobody else could do that
[56:05] nobody else could do that
[56:08] purged our sins sat down at the right
[56:11] hand of the majesty upon high being made
[56:14] so much better than the angels as he had
[56:18] by an inheritance obtained a better
[56:21] obtained a more excellent name than they
[56:25] he came in his father's name
[56:28] now remember this
[56:30] for
[56:31] and and again
[56:35] for unto which the angel said he at any
[56:37] time thou art my son this day have i
[56:40] begotten thee and again i will be to him
[56:43] a father and he shall be to me a son
[56:46] and again when he bringeth in the first
[56:49] begotten into the world he said
[56:52] and let all the angels of god
[56:55] worship him
[56:59] are you with me now
[57:01] and and the angels he said
[57:04] who maketh his angels spirits and
[57:07] ministers of a flame of fire but unto
[57:10] his son he said thy throne o god
[57:16] is forever
[57:18] and ever
[57:20] a scepter of righteousness
[57:22] is the scepter of
[57:24] my kingdom
[57:26] thou hast loved righteousness and hated
[57:29] iniquity therefore god even thy god hath
[57:34] anointed thee with the all of gladness
[57:37] above thy fellows i read all of that to
[57:40] say this to you jesus will never be just
[57:43] one of the boys
[57:49] hallelujah he is king of kings and he's
[57:53] lord of lords he is the mighty god he is
[57:57] the everlasting father he is the prince
[58:00] of peace
[58:01] [Applause]
[58:07] hallelujah
[58:08] understand when the book of ruth is
[58:10] written
[58:12] to most theologians it is considered a
[58:15] love story
[58:17] maybe even questioned
[58:19] why it would even be placed in the
[58:21] chronicles of the scriptures
[58:23] when the book of enoch was not placed in
[58:25] the scriptures when other great writings
[58:27] was not placed in the scripture great
[58:30] arguments are read about you can read
[58:32] about them a great argument why was ruth
[58:34] placed there but only under the ministry
[58:37] of the son of man of this day
[58:40] when the seals are released you could go
[58:43] back the breach it testifies of what
[58:46] ruth was
[58:48] that there was church ages but we needed
[58:51] a messenger to come in this day
[58:55] are you with me to take us from church
[58:57] ages and elevate the word and open the
[59:01] word
[59:03] where it would not be a reformer of a
[59:05] man or not be the thoughts of a man
[59:08] probing at the word but god wanted to
[59:10] open the book
[59:12] remember he couldn't allow that to a man
[59:15] but he being the author could step forth
[59:18] in this day
[59:20] now listen he don't do it just to see if
[59:22] he can do it he's got a bride that's
[59:25] attributes that he thought of before the
[59:27] foundation of the world
[59:29] [Music]
[59:33] no the world will never understand it
[59:37] don't expect denominations to open their
[59:40] arms and say we love this message
[59:43] it wasn't for them
[59:47] i don't know i don't know how to say it
[59:49] any different
[59:52] hawks eat hulk food
[59:55] buzzards eat buzzard food
[59:58] but eagles
[1:00:01] are for prophetic people
[1:00:04] that are a prophetic class
[1:00:06] that will eat a prophetic word
[1:00:10] [Music]
[1:00:12] so when we look back in the scriptures
[1:00:14] as much as god used prophets to speak
[1:00:18] god uses a man like joseph to be in a
[1:00:21] dungeon
[1:00:23] and then to be elevated to the prince
[1:00:26] god uses a man like jonah
[1:00:31] you can argue a lot of ways jonah
[1:00:34] actually said throw me off i'm the man
[1:00:37] throws him in the ocean
[1:00:39] and a fish a great fish
[1:00:44] swallows jonah a fish that was prepared
[1:00:48] swallows jonah and he's going to be a
[1:00:51] type of jesus christ he'll lay three
[1:00:54] days in the earth
[1:00:57] and jesus will stand on the earth in
[1:00:59] human form and look back to jonah
[1:01:04] that many will look like as a backsid
[1:01:07] sliding prophet
[1:01:09] but he'll look not at his
[1:01:12] failure of humanity
[1:01:15] or not wanting to go and preach the word
[1:01:17] to that people that he actually hated
[1:01:21] and let me just say this you and god
[1:01:23] knew that he had to have an example of
[1:01:26] jesus laying in the ground
[1:01:29] in the belly of hell for three days
[1:01:32] and so jonah displays that
[1:01:35] now if jesus had a display we have to
[1:01:37] have a display
[1:01:39] ruth was our display
[1:01:42] and she's living her life as a woman a
[1:01:45] virtuous woman she's worked in the field
[1:01:48] she stayed in the field
[1:01:51] last night we read about that she laid
[1:01:54] at his feet
[1:01:57] and he asked who are you and she said i
[1:02:00] am ruth
[1:02:01] and he gave her instructions to pull the
[1:02:03] skirt his skirt down over top of her
[1:02:08] now to the eyes of the beholder you
[1:02:10] would see that this was not a very clean
[1:02:13] act but it was actually redemption being
[1:02:16] displayed by god
[1:02:18] himself i'll take your shame
[1:02:21] i'll take your sins i'll take your
[1:02:24] mistakes you were born in sin and i'm
[1:02:27] going to redeem you not back to your
[1:02:29] natural birth but i'm going to redeem
[1:02:32] you back to your eternal birth
[1:02:44] i've got to remind you that you came
[1:02:46] from god and you're going back to god
[1:02:50] [Applause]
[1:02:52] you got to see past going past your
[1:02:54] earthly mother and father
[1:02:58] they got you here
[1:03:00] but you've got to look at the eternal
[1:03:02] realm
[1:03:09] ruth chapter 4 bears out that boaz finds
[1:03:12] himself at the gate
[1:03:14] and he sat down there as as a kinsman
[1:03:16] redeemer
[1:03:18] and he has to carry out legal
[1:03:20] rights
[1:03:23] god just can't send you to hell or send
[1:03:26] you to heaven
[1:03:27] it has to be legally done
[1:03:32] it has to be legally done if you want to
[1:03:34] buy a piece of ground from brother mike
[1:03:37] over here
[1:03:38] you have to legally buy that ground
[1:03:42] you have to go through the proper
[1:03:44] proper
[1:03:45] avenues to buy that piece of ground
[1:03:48] when god came to earth he legally
[1:03:51] has to buy you
[1:03:57] he can't just i save him i'll pick this
[1:03:59] one and i'll pick this one no he has to
[1:04:02] legally
[1:04:04] because naomi was involved
[1:04:07] her land was involved
[1:04:09] amen
[1:04:11] now understand that i i don't mean to
[1:04:13] get here but understand
[1:04:15] it couldn't be transferred from one
[1:04:17] tribe to another
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:20] are you with me it couldn't be
[1:04:22] transferred from over to zebulon's tribe
[1:04:25] because she was in the line of judah
[1:04:28] so so it couldn't be transferred over
[1:04:30] there not just anybody can buy the land
[1:04:33] not just anybody wants to go and and and
[1:04:36] by the land of a widow and then a
[1:04:39] daughter that has been come out of the
[1:04:40] descendants of lot
[1:04:44] who has worshiped false gods
[1:04:46] because you have to bring their
[1:04:49] reputation
[1:04:50] into your household
[1:04:54] so he has 10 witnesses to come
[1:04:57] the nearer kinsman
[1:05:02] the accuser of the brethren
[1:05:05] is your nearer
[1:05:06] fleshly kinsmen
[1:05:10] but he can't redeem you
[1:05:13] all your vows and promises won't redeem
[1:05:16] you
[1:05:17] but boaz jesus christ
[1:05:21] is willing to pay the price and it's
[1:05:24] going to be costly
[1:05:27] it's going to cost him the blood of the
[1:05:29] lamb
[1:05:32] he's got to leave the ivory palaces of
[1:05:34] heaven
[1:05:35] take on humanity be to be mocked for
[1:05:38] over 30 years and then three years
[1:05:41] spend a life of ministry upon the earth
[1:05:44] displaying god himself
[1:05:47] constantly asking do you know who i am
[1:05:49] do you see who i am
[1:05:52] and only a handful of people would
[1:05:54] really get it
[1:05:55] [Music]
[1:06:01] bo ass asked the nearer kinsmen will you
[1:06:03] redeem her
[1:06:04] well i'll take naomi in the property
[1:06:07] i'll pay i'll i'll take that
[1:06:10] i'll take naomi in the property and then
[1:06:12] boaz reminds him you got to take ruth as
[1:06:16] well
[1:06:22] i wish i felt like shouting right now
[1:06:26] you couldn't redeem yourself so don't
[1:06:27] get your stuff collar up
[1:06:32] don't you say i'm so special i you know
[1:06:35] this church ought to appreciate let me
[1:06:36] say all of us had sinned
[1:06:39] and come short of the glory of jesus
[1:06:41] christ
[1:06:42] but god raises us from what we was to
[1:06:46] what we're going to be
[1:06:48] and only god can do that
[1:07:05] i can't take her into my house
[1:07:08] i can't call her my bride
[1:07:11] can you see how much satan makes fun of
[1:07:14] you and the church makes fun of you
[1:07:16] they don't want you
[1:07:18] but jesus does that's a really good
[1:07:20] decision
[1:07:21] [Music]
[1:07:25] brother ron that's just way off you're
[1:07:26] just making that up
[1:07:28] washington is telling us today
[1:07:31] that they don't want the bride of christ
[1:07:36] they really don't want the bride of
[1:07:38] jesus christ
[1:07:40] as a matter of fact if we would open up
[1:07:41] on sodom and gomorrah they would arrest
[1:07:43] me put me in prison
[1:07:48] but it's the truth anyway
[1:07:52] but they would call us a cult
[1:07:54] and brother ron i don't want to be
[1:07:55] associated with that well if a cult
[1:07:58] is a small group with one leader jesus
[1:08:01] fits the bill
[1:08:03] but if it's a huge group and one leader
[1:08:06] the catholic church fits the bill i'd
[1:08:09] rather be with jesus every day of the
[1:08:11] week
[1:08:25] don't get your eyes on our messenger
[1:08:28] our message was sent our messenger was
[1:08:30] sent to deliver the message
[1:08:32] he's not your bridegroom
[1:08:34] he was a phenomenal man but he's not who
[1:08:37] you fall in love with
[1:08:39] [Applause]
[1:08:41] i don't mean that bad let me just say
[1:08:42] this to you we love brother branham and
[1:08:44] everything and no disrespect whatsoever
[1:08:46] but he couldn't die for his sins less
[1:08:48] long hours
[1:08:51] he he brought the message and was
[1:08:53] entrusted with the message
[1:08:58] are you with me now
[1:09:00] he couldn't take you in but the holy
[1:09:03] spirit the angel of the lord
[1:09:06] is here to finish the work
[1:09:10] stay in the field wire our kinsmen it's
[1:09:14] already been paid for
[1:09:21] then if you will not redeem her
[1:09:24] i will
[1:09:26] and not only will i redeem her i'm going
[1:09:28] to take her as my wife
[1:09:34] i want to read you a couple of words
[1:09:36] here in the scriptures
[1:09:39] this is phenomenal
[1:09:42] you see you
[1:09:43] by reading ruth and ruth is written
[1:09:46] after their lives
[1:09:50] i wanted to watch what i'm going to do
[1:09:51] with it just for a moment
[1:09:54] 4 13.
[1:09:56] so boaz took ruth
[1:10:00] and she was his wife
[1:10:04] and when he went in unto her the lord
[1:10:06] gave her conception
[1:10:09] and she bear a son
[1:10:12] and the women said unto naomi blessed be
[1:10:15] the lord
[1:10:17] which hath not left thee this day
[1:10:19] without a kinsmen
[1:10:22] that his name may be famous
[1:10:25] in israel they were speaking prophecy
[1:10:30] because she was now carrying on naomi
[1:10:33] without hope her lineage is now carrying
[1:10:36] on the line of the tribe of judah
[1:10:41] hallelujah and she thought her plan was
[1:10:43] completely lost
[1:10:49] and he
[1:10:50] and he shall be unto thee a restorer of
[1:10:53] thy life
[1:10:54] and a nourisher of thine old age for thy
[1:10:59] daughter-in-law
[1:11:00] which loved thee
[1:11:02] which is better to thee than
[1:11:04] seven sons
[1:11:08] hath borne him
[1:11:09] and naomi took the child and laid it in
[1:11:12] her bosom and and began to nurse unto it
[1:11:15] and the women
[1:11:17] her neighbors gave it a name
[1:11:20] saying this is a son
[1:11:22] born to
[1:11:24] naomi amen
[1:11:26] and they called his name obed
[1:11:30] and obed is the father of jesse
[1:11:34] the father of david
[1:11:40] oh glory
[1:11:41] [Music]

[1:11:58] and and boaz begot obed
[1:12:02] and obed begot jesse and jesse begot
[1:12:05] david
[1:12:07] that's the way the writer wrote it in
[1:12:09] the book of ruth
[1:12:11] but let's go forward
[1:12:14] under the new covenant
[1:12:16] and the book of generation of jesus
[1:12:18] christ the son of david the son of
[1:12:19] abraham and abraham begot isaac and
[1:12:22] isaac begat jacob and jacob begat judas
[1:12:26] and his brethren and judas begat pharas
[1:12:32] and zara of tamar

[1:12:48] and ambram forget abinadab and a
[1:12:51] building map got nation and nation begat
[1:12:54] salmon

[1:13:03] and someone begat boaz
[1:13:07] of rahab
[1:13:09] [Music]
[1:13:13] and boaz begat obed
[1:13:17] of ruth
[1:13:20] and obed begot jesse
[1:13:26] god didn't overlook these women
[1:13:30] when it come to matthew when he's
[1:13:32] writing it
[1:13:33] the writer of ruth
[1:13:36] left them out
[1:13:37] but god didn't forget
[1:13:40] [Applause]
[1:13:42] he raised them from that room
[1:13:45] to the realm of the lineage of the line
[1:13:48] of the tribe of judah
[1:13:50] and though their paths be awful he
[1:13:53] lifted them
[1:13:58] let me just say this to you god wants to
[1:14:01] lift you
[1:14:04] lift you out of laodicea you're more
[1:14:07] than a church you're more than a people
[1:14:10] you're more than just
[1:14:12] believers you are the bride of the lamb
[1:14:16] of god
[1:14:35] i'm gonna ask you just a couple
[1:14:36] questions
[1:14:38] can you read yourself in the book
[1:14:47] your friends may go i don't see that
[1:14:50] but you do
[1:14:54] your friends look at the very same
[1:14:56] scriptures and you read
[1:14:58] and they can't see it
[1:15:00] but because of the seed from where
[1:15:02] you're from
[1:15:03] causes you to see it
[1:15:05] don't make fun of them
[1:15:10] in god's kingdom
[1:15:13] in god's kingdom
[1:15:16] he has a plan
[1:15:19] some are gold dollars
[1:15:21] some are silver dollars some are
[1:15:24] quarters
[1:15:25] some are even wooden
[1:15:29] but they're all in the kingdom
[1:15:37] be careful who you throw stone at
[1:15:41] brother branham is in california and
[1:15:44] he's talking about those hippies
[1:15:46] up in the mountain
[1:15:50] he said god's even got seed up in the
[1:15:52] mountains
[1:15:53] well john steeman was up in that
[1:15:55] mountain he was pointing at
[1:15:57] running
[1:15:58] making fun
[1:16:00] of the message
[1:16:04] and
[1:16:06] he moves sister sister steven to to
[1:16:09] florida
[1:16:11] and he's upset
[1:16:13] he he moves her everywhere one day she's
[1:16:15] wanting to go to a baptismal service and
[1:16:17] john is so mad that she's going to go to
[1:16:20] a baptismal service
[1:16:21] and he is in the house and it was one
[1:16:23] you remember those houses that go
[1:16:25] you you could run all the way around
[1:16:27] four rooms in a path
[1:16:30] and he was making his journey around
[1:16:32] those four four four rooms and whatever
[1:16:35] and he was making his journey mad and
[1:16:38] mad because she was going to that
[1:16:39] baptismal surface and something happened
[1:16:42] to him on one of those circles
[1:16:47] something happened to him
[1:16:51] and he came around said i'm going with
[1:16:52] you
[1:16:55] and she thought this is a trap
[1:17:00] he has sat outside the church and blowed
[1:17:03] his horn
[1:17:06] trying to disrupt the service he's moved
[1:17:08] us all over the country
[1:17:10] and he goes to the water baptismal
[1:17:12] service and he doesn't raise a ruckus
[1:17:15] but he get baptized
[1:17:17] [Applause]
[1:17:19] and the man that fought it like paul
[1:17:22] fought it
[1:17:23] the man that fought it so much
[1:17:28] he became such an advocate for the
[1:17:30] message of the hour he developed a
[1:17:33] 60-second sermon and stood at the red
[1:17:36] light
[1:17:38] and he preached a second 60-second
[1:17:41] sermon to those that would hear it
[1:17:45] two boys walked up to him drinking
[1:17:49] and he preached to them and those two
[1:17:51] boys became
[1:17:52] members of his church
[1:17:55] and one became his son-in-law
[1:18:01] [Music]
[1:18:02] he's one of the heroes of faith in my
[1:18:05] book
[1:18:06] he never considered himself a preacher
[1:18:08] never considered himself a great
[1:18:10] in-depth preacher but he has been one of
[1:18:13] my heroes that i looked at as one of the
[1:18:16] great men of the message of the hour
[1:18:21] another's name caleb
[1:18:23] you got his picture
[1:18:26] do we have a picture of caleb
[1:18:30] he's another hero
[1:18:32] i went to his country i preached
[1:18:34] underground to about 200 people we saw
[1:18:37] the angel of the lord in the building
[1:18:42] to us going to church
[1:18:45] is is almost entertainment or just or
[1:18:48] just eating the word
[1:18:50] but to them it's a chance of going to
[1:18:52] prison
[1:18:54] to preach the message that i'm preaching
[1:18:55] this morning in his country
[1:18:58] cost him going to a hard labor camp
[1:19:05] do you mind you have it just whenever
[1:19:07] you have it
[1:19:08] but let me just say he found himself in
[1:19:11] the scriptures
[1:19:13] let me just share this with you how many
[1:19:15] has ever been in a very large gathering
[1:19:17] of people that are in a picture
[1:19:20] maybe 40 50 of you are standing in a
[1:19:22] picture and you're there
[1:19:24] you know what you do when you when they
[1:19:26] show you the picture
[1:19:29] you find yourself
[1:19:33] hey you're a bunch of vain people
[1:19:40] but it's the truth
[1:19:42] you find yourself in the picture
[1:19:47] and for most women they go well my hair
[1:19:49] wasn't just rot
[1:19:51] 99 of the men not looking at their own
[1:19:54] hell
[1:19:55] but you find yourself in the picture was
[1:19:57] a standing right was it looking right
[1:19:59] was in the right window of the picture
[1:20:01] they didn't get me just that of me
[1:20:05] when you're looking in the word of god
[1:20:07] you want to find yourself
[1:20:10] ruth goes back home
[1:20:12] and she has been given
[1:20:16] spiritual food in due season she's got
[1:20:20] to wait on the worthy one
[1:20:24] she can't do anything to redeem herself
[1:20:27] and so she simply tarries and waits on
[1:20:31] the worthy one
[1:20:33] and she eats the mighty god unveiled and
[1:20:35] while she's eating the mighty god
[1:20:37] unveils she sees herself
[1:20:39] when she's re when she's eating the
[1:20:42] future home of the of the heavenly
[1:20:44] bridegroom and the earthly bride she
[1:20:46] sees herself when she's listening to the
[1:20:49] mighty god unveiled
[1:20:53] characteristics of jesus christ
[1:20:55] abraham revealed abraham restored she
[1:20:59] sees herself in the book
[1:21:12] let me just say this to you you can read
[1:21:14] your yourself in the book
[1:21:17] when you read revelations chapter 21 and
[1:21:19] i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[1:21:22] you're actually reading your future
[1:21:30] i'm not going to be but another minute
[1:21:31] or two
[1:21:33] ruth
[1:21:34] could not read her future
[1:21:36] she could only walk into it
[1:21:44] but you can read your future
[1:21:48] but it takes faith
[1:21:50] to step into it
[1:21:57] it's kind of like my healing i just have
[1:21:59] to keep trusting him
[1:22:04] it's the same as the rapture
[1:22:07] rebecca you can sing right after i get
[1:22:09] done here
[1:22:12] kind of like right after the right up to
[1:22:14] the rapture
[1:22:15] we've got to trust him
[1:22:20] up to the moment of change
[1:22:24] doesn't matter what anybody says
[1:22:29] it doesn't matter what anybody says
[1:22:31] we got to trust him
[1:22:33] we got to walk into it
[1:22:35] we got to simply walk into it
[1:22:37] step into it
[1:22:40] well brother ron we were we're 50 years
[1:22:42] past the messenger and he's been gone 50
[1:22:45] years that's right and god knew it all
[1:22:46] the time
[1:22:48] well brother ron is there going to be
[1:22:50] one of the great ministers preach a
[1:22:52] sermon that will take us into the
[1:22:53] rapture oh no no no
[1:22:55] you just keep eating the book
[1:22:58] you just keep going to church you keep
[1:23:00] eating the word and the season will
[1:23:02] change
[1:23:03] don't you worry about the season
[1:23:07] we're in a season of natural change
[1:23:12] a couple of weeks ago it was at its peak
[1:23:18] when we were standing at your wedding
[1:23:20] who do we think that kept all the leaves
[1:23:22] on one side of the tree
[1:23:25] swept all of them off just like swept
[1:23:26] all of them off and on one side of the
[1:23:28] tree all the leaves were there on the
[1:23:30] other side it was completely bare
[1:23:32] the master
[1:23:36] it's kind of like brother branham
[1:23:38] standing with an infidel
[1:23:42] one of the most powerful sermons that
[1:23:43] brother branham ever preaches
[1:23:45] was at an infidel's house
[1:23:49] and he talked and he uses that over and
[1:23:51] over again
[1:23:52] that man sitting up there if he can only
[1:23:54] talk to brother branham
[1:23:56] brother wood so wanted to tell that
[1:23:57] that's brother random he's talking to
[1:23:58] and he simply stopped him
[1:24:03] because he didn't want flesh and blood
[1:24:04] to reveal it to him
[1:24:07] and he talks to him about yellow jacket
[1:24:11] bitten apples on the ground
[1:24:14] leaves turning
[1:24:16] and he said what intelligence tells that
[1:24:18] tree
[1:24:20] so what intelligence have told all these
[1:24:22] trees
[1:24:25] to change their colors and the sac to go
[1:24:27] back in the ground cause winter's coming
[1:24:31] and he says well let me just put a a a
[1:24:33] glass of water on a post
[1:24:39] are you with me and then he tells him
[1:24:41] the same intelligence is telling that
[1:24:43] tree
[1:24:45] for the leaves for the for the life to
[1:24:47] leave those leaves to go back in the
[1:24:49] ground it's the same intelligence that
[1:24:52] told me about that woman up on the hill
[1:24:57] and that man's eyes came open
[1:25:00] he could have preached him a sermon
[1:25:02] after sermon after sermon but he stood
[1:25:05] there and the creator of life
[1:25:08] knew that that predestinated seed was
[1:25:10] laying inside of them
[1:25:13] [Applause]
[1:25:26] that kind of seems far-fetched
[1:25:29] well let me just tell you take you back
[1:25:30] to another story
[1:25:32] woman
[1:25:35] bring me a drink
[1:25:42] bring me a drink
[1:25:49] i think the chosen series does such a
[1:25:51] good job with that
[1:25:53] i probably watched it 200 times that
[1:25:55] clip
[1:25:56] woman bring me a drink
[1:25:58] because i can hear brother branham
[1:26:01] the hundreds of times that brother
[1:26:02] branham says woman bring me a drink
[1:26:06] she brings up a racial issue
[1:26:08] our fathers worshipped in these
[1:26:10] mountains
[1:26:12] now god had not allowed himself to be
[1:26:15] revealed to none of those denominations
[1:26:19] help me preach i'm almost done
[1:26:22] he would not tell them who he was
[1:26:26] to the hierarchy of the nominal world
[1:26:32] but to an infidel on the porch excuse me
[1:26:35] to a woman at the well
[1:26:39] to a woman at the well
[1:26:43] he said
[1:26:44] you've had five husbands
[1:26:46] and the one you're living with
[1:26:48] he's not your husband
[1:26:50] and she knew then
[1:26:54] she knew then
[1:26:57] that's him
[1:26:59] and he said
[1:27:00] i am he
[1:27:06] she wasn't welcome at none of those
[1:27:07] churches
[1:27:10] she was not welcome at any of those
[1:27:12] churches
[1:27:14] but the worthy one
[1:27:18] are you catching it now
[1:27:20] the worthy one was sitting with her
[1:27:25] when they screamed to him come down off
[1:27:27] of the cross
[1:27:29] brother random looked at that statement
[1:27:31] as the greatest compliment they could
[1:27:34] have given him
[1:27:39] they thought they were making fun of him
[1:27:41] and brother brahm said it was the
[1:27:42] greatest compliment they could give him
[1:27:45] because he could have
[1:27:48] but because of redemption like boaz at
[1:27:51] the gate the price had to be paid and
[1:27:55] the price was his black
[1:28:00] men
[1:28:01] men have a hard time dying for one
[1:28:03] another
[1:28:04] but it doesn't redeem nobody but this
[1:28:07] lamb of god
[1:28:09] was doing something that the blood of
[1:28:11] bulls and goats could not do
[1:28:14] because
[1:28:15] he was the worthy one
[1:28:23] and i finished with
[1:28:26] this the book of redemption
[1:28:31] when john sees it
[1:28:33] he's standing between church ages and
[1:28:35] seals
[1:28:38] he's chronologically perfectly in the
[1:28:40] scriptures
[1:28:41] he's standing between church ages and
[1:28:43] seals
[1:28:47] and no man was worthy
[1:28:50] let me just say this to you spurgeon was
[1:28:52] a great preacher prince of preachers
[1:28:55] but he couldn't open the book
[1:29:00] wesley was a phenomenal reformer and
[1:29:03] prophet
[1:29:04] but he couldn't open the book
[1:29:07] pentecost was an incredible movement but
[1:29:09] they couldn't open the book
[1:29:12] and john is standing witnessing as a
[1:29:15] witness
[1:29:18] if no man is worthy we're lost
[1:29:22] if no man is worthy
[1:29:24] to take the book and to loose the seals
[1:29:27] thereof
[1:29:28] and to pay the price of redemption
[1:29:31] we're lost
[1:29:37] and the angel speaks to him weep not
[1:29:39] john
[1:29:40] behold the lion
[1:29:44] of the tribe of judah
[1:29:46] and it could not be complete
[1:29:49] without rahab
[1:29:52] without tamar
[1:29:54] without without boaz
[1:29:58] and ruth
[1:30:02] i want to bring it forward
[1:30:04] it could not be complete without you
[1:30:09] why has the rapture been delayed
[1:30:14] why has it been delayed
[1:30:16] look around the building
[1:30:21] brother branham said he could not see
[1:30:23] past 1977 because that's how dark the
[1:30:25] world became and i would say this world
[1:30:28] became so wicked in this darkness of
[1:30:30] laodicea
[1:30:37] how much worse can it get
[1:30:42] i sometimes almost boycott the news
[1:30:45] because i feel so
[1:30:46] nasty
[1:30:48] once i read what's going on
[1:30:51] and what hollywood calls great i find it
[1:30:54] the putrid of the earth
[1:30:59] are you with me the commercials that's
[1:31:01] on your phone is not worthy to even
[1:31:03] [Applause]
[1:31:07] god save us from this mess
[1:31:12] god save us from this mess
[1:31:16] come on church
[1:31:20] i'd say this stay in the field
[1:31:24] stay where redemption's at
[1:31:27] stay where the resurrection's that
[1:31:29] stay where the rapture's at
[1:31:36] you look around and you see this one
[1:31:38] coming up and that one coming up and
[1:31:39] that one coming up
[1:31:41] i haven't calculated this but
[1:31:43] what year were you born
[1:31:46] 95.
[1:31:52] what year were you born
[1:31:54] 94.

[1:35:24] full of frolic and full of all that
[1:35:25] nonsense
[1:35:32] we shared my heart
[1:35:37] and homer and i recognized there was a

[1:35:43] nonsense
[1:35:47] and i took him to vancouver
[1:35:50] both of my boys to vancouver
[1:35:53] it would be in louisiana where matthew
[1:35:55] would receive the holy ghost
[1:35:58] and they would tell me while i was in
[1:35:59] bed that matthew's speaking in tongues
[1:36:02] and he spoke in tongues almost all night
[1:36:05] and that was what i was waiting on
[1:36:08] because i don't want church members i
[1:36:09] want real sons
[1:36:17] somebody told me the other day said
