[0:00] [Music]
[0:58] some time ago i was reading in a book
[1:02] of a little boss that was
[1:06] entered a contest and in this
[1:09] contest he was to make himself a
[1:12] famous name any little boy who could
[1:16] keep the password
[1:17] in his mind until he got to a certain
[1:20] place
[1:22] and he would speak this password and the
[1:24] gatekeeper would let him through
[1:28] that was to test the iq of the child
[1:32] and when he got to the place speaking
[1:35] the passwords that was given him
[1:37] the gate would open and he would win
[1:40] a great honor
[1:43] [Music]
[1:45] one little boy being very swift-footed
[1:48] and no good and well that he could
[1:50] outrun all the rest of the boys
[1:53] in the contest or he thought he could
[1:57] he practiced day after day of
[2:00] running how he pumped up his little
[2:04] lungs
[2:06] got his physical body and trim
[2:09] so that he wouldn't tire as he run
[2:13] and he practiced how to start with his
[2:16] feet and get a head plunge
[2:20] ahead of the rest of the boys how that
[2:22] he must breathe
[2:23] during the time of his running in order
[2:27] to hold
[2:28] the oxygen that came to his body to keep
[2:30] him pumping off
[2:32] that it wouldn't slow up his heart too
[2:34] much he studied it from every angle that
[2:37] he could
[2:40] and in the morning that the race started
[2:44] there was more than 150 little boys
[2:47] lined up at a certain age this little
[2:50] boy was rather a good-sized boy for his
[2:52] age
[2:54] and he remembered all of his training
[2:57] and he got ready they got on the line
[3:01] popped their little faces against strain
[3:04] that come along
[3:05] push the little nose up against it it
[3:08] studied all the rules of that
[3:11] making himself ready and then when the
[3:14] gun
[3:15] fired and the line was broken
[3:18] the little boy jumped forward and this
[3:21] little guy so
[3:22] physically fit until he jumped way ahead
[3:24] of the rest of him
[3:27] and down the track he went with a
[3:29] terrific speed
[3:31] well trained until he could outrun
[3:35] every boy that was in the race
[3:39] and he was there all quite a long time
[3:42] maybe a minute or more before
[3:46] the best of the other runners ever
[3:48] reached
[3:49] the place but all of his physical
[3:53] training
[3:55] he had forgotten the password
[3:58] he had forgotten the very thing that he
[4:00] was to say to let him in the gate
[4:03] and he paced back and forth and stalled
[4:06] it
[4:07] searched to his mind he had been so
[4:10] interested in the magical natural
[4:13] physical conditions of his body
[4:15] till he had forgotten the main thing
[4:19] on down the line some boys that didn't
[4:21] run so fast
[4:22] remember the password and entered in
[4:26] so is it today we are so
[4:29] interested in building great shrines and
[4:32] churches and buildings and so forth
[4:36] i'm so interested in keeping our
[4:39] churches in good trim with fine
[4:42] buildings and
[4:43] nice plush pews and fine organs
[4:47] our ministers so well trained from
[4:50] they've got

[50:22] verse 1.
[50:31] with the help of the lord i'd like to
[50:32] speak this evening on the token life
[50:35] exodus chapter 12 and the lord spake
[50:39] unto moses
[50:40] and aaron in the land of egypt saying
[50:42] this month
[50:43] shall be unto you the beginning of
[50:45] months it shall be the first month of
[50:47] the year to you
[50:49] speaking into the congregation of israel
[50:51] saying in the tenth day
[50:52] of this month shall they take to them
[50:54] every man a lamb
[50:56] according to the house of their fathers
[50:59] a lamb for a house
[51:00] and if the household be too little for
[51:02] the lamb let him and his neighbor
[51:04] next into his house take it according to
[51:07] the number of the
[51:08] souls every man according to his eating
[51:11] shall make your count for the lamb
[51:13] your lamb shall be without blemish a
[51:17] male of the first year you shall take it
[51:19] out from the sheep or from the goats and
[51:22] he shall keep it unto the fourteenth day
[51:24] of the same month
[51:25] and the whole assembly of the
[51:26] congregation of israel
[51:28] shall kill it in the evening and they
[51:31] shall take of the blood
[51:32] and strike it on the two side post and
[51:34] on the upper doorposts of the houses
[51:37] wherein they shall eat it and they shall
[51:39] eat the flesh in that night
[51:42] roast with fire and unleavened bread and
[51:44] with bitter herbs
[51:45] shall they eat it eat not of it raw nor
[51:48] sodden at all with water but roast with
[51:50] fire
[51:52] his head and his legs with the
[51:53] proteinants thereof
[51:55] and they shall let nothing of it remain
[51:57] until the morning and that which
[51:58] remaineth of it unto the morning ye
[52:00] shall burn with fire
[52:02] and thus shall he eat it with your loins
[52:05] girded your shoes on your feet and your
[52:07] staff in your hand
[52:08] and ye shall eat it in haste it is the
[52:10] lord's passover
[52:12] for i will pass through the land of
[52:14] egypt this night
[52:15] and will smite all the firstborn in the
[52:17] land of egypt both man and beast
[52:19] and against all the gods of egypt i will
[52:21] execute judgment
[52:23] i am the lord and the blood shall be for
[52:26] you
[52:26] a for a token upon the houses where ye
[52:30] are
[52:31] and when i see the blood i will pass
[52:34] over you
[52:35] and the plague shall not be upon you to
[52:38] destroy you
[52:39] when i smite the land of egypt amen god
[52:42] bless you as you're seated
[52:45] this is a very familiar text that we've
[52:48] no doubt read many many times
[52:51] but i would say that it's more important
[52:53] now for us in this end time
[52:55] than it's ever been we live in a very
[52:57] very special
[52:58] age has been many ages where god has
[53:01] dealt with his people
[53:02] and we know the background of the story
[53:04] israel was down in bondage
[53:06] god came to abraham and promised him a
[53:08] seed when he was
[53:09] his seed was dead and told him that his
[53:11] seed was sojourn in the land of egypt
[53:13] for 400 years
[53:15] god is a very faithful god to his word
[53:17] so when the process of time became
[53:19] completed god raised up a prophet in the
[53:22] land
[53:23] and trained him in the desert and this
[53:26] prophet had to forget he was raised
[53:28] to believe and to understand that he was
[53:30] a special child
[53:31] and that he was going to be the
[53:32] deliverer but you know god had to
[53:34] actually take him out into the desert
[53:37] and get all of that intellectual faith
[53:39] out of him god had to train his prophet
[53:42] and the prophet before he could bring a
[53:44] deliverance to his people
[53:45] had to meet god face to face it wasn't
[53:48] enough to hear from his parents what a
[53:49] great god he was and what he did
[53:51] for abraham for isaac for jacob
[53:54] moses had to meet this god for himself
[53:57] and when he had that burning bush
[53:58] experience he was then
[54:00] in a position where god could use him
[54:02] and send him down
[54:03] to deliver his people and we know that
[54:06] god has a way of doing things
[54:08] and many times the world we live in does
[54:10] not like
[54:12] how god does things but if you want to
[54:14] worship god and if you want to please
[54:16] god
[54:17] you've got to come god's provided way
[54:19] and not your provided way or not my
[54:22] provided way
[54:22] god has a provided way and one of them
[54:25] provided ways is god's word comes to a
[54:28] prophet
[54:29] so if a word prophet where he will sin
[54:32] at a given age and the god will speak
[54:34] through that prophet
[54:36] and those that have the ability to hear
[54:38] that prophet or the elect of that age
[54:40] and they ca and they call out an elected
[54:42] people
[54:44] those that have an ear to hear so israel
[54:47] was in bondage for over 400 years and
[54:49] god
[54:49] said that i have come down to deliver my
[54:52] people
[54:53] but then moses walks into egypt moses
[54:56] was
[54:56] god's representation on the earth
[55:01] so when god sent moses he gave him two
[55:04] signs
[55:05] he vindicated him with two signs he
[55:06] vindicated him with a pillar of fire
[55:09] because it was time for israel to become
[55:11] from a nation
[55:13] to a church and we know that a church
[55:16] means to be called
[55:17] out a nation out of a nation
[55:21] israel was a nation down in egypt but
[55:22] once god sent a prophet and called out
[55:25] the people of israel out of egypt they
[55:28] then became the church
[55:30] of god and many of us were either out in
[55:33] the world or out in denominational
[55:34] churches
[55:35] and god sent us a prophet in this third
[55:38] exodus
[55:38] to call us out
[55:42] so god satan challenged god
[55:46] with through pharaoh not wanting to let
[55:48] his people go so god came and vindicated
[55:51] moses message there were 10 different
[55:53] plagues and the last plague
[55:54] the one that we took our text from was a
[55:56] plague of death
[55:58] and if we ever live in a time of
[56:00] spiritual death it is
[56:01] now so what god required
[56:04] then was in type and in shadow god now
[56:07] requires it in reality
[56:11] as the token god requires the token
[56:14] it's not a suggestion it's not a good
[56:16] idea he requires
[56:18] the token and he promised that if you
[56:22] have the token
[56:23] the death angel must pass your house
[56:27] just as it passed their natural houses
[56:29] that they dwelt in
[56:31] it is now promised to pass over you
[56:34] because the death angel is sweeping the
[56:36] land
[56:37] and those without the token
[56:41] will die now the token
[56:45] then was they had to kill the lamb and
[56:47] they had to actually get the blood of
[56:49] the lamb
[56:49] and put it on their physical houses on
[56:51] the doorpost and lentil their doors
[56:54] but the token today is the literal life
[56:57] of jesus
[56:58] christ it is the holy ghost it is the
[56:59] born-again experience
[57:01] and god said jesus when he was on the
[57:02] earth said ye must be born again
[57:05] it is a you must be born again
[57:09] he didn't say you must join a church you
[57:12] must put your name on the book you must
[57:13] live even a good life
[57:15] he said ye must be born again
[57:19] that is a requirement and it is the
[57:21] literal
[57:22] life of jesus christ the blood on the
[57:25] door
[57:25] was then proof that there was a lamb
[57:28] that died
[57:29] for that family it was an evidence and
[57:32] showed that an innocent lamb who did
[57:34] nothing
[57:35] died for you and they were to not only
[57:39] have the lamb and keep it up and god
[57:41] gave them special instructions
[57:43] they had to actually kill the lamb and
[57:45] then they actually had to physically
[57:47] apply the blood of the lamb
[57:50] now the lamb the token had to be applied
[57:53] before the wrath fell
[57:55] it was easy for those in the andalusian
[57:57] world to believe
[57:58] in noah's message once the rain started
[58:01] falling
[58:01] it's going to be easy to believe in the
[58:03] rapture and the prophet's message
[58:05] after there's a catching away of the
[58:07] people it's going to be
[58:08] easy to believe in a resurrection after
[58:11] it already happens
[58:13] it's easy for people to claim jesus now
[58:16] that he's come and gone and he and he
[58:18] sent back the holy ghost but
[58:20] when he was there in flesh they
[58:22] struggled with recognizing the word and
[58:24] flesh
[58:27] and jesus christ is the same yesterday
[58:29] today and forever
[58:30] people struggle recognizing jesus christ
[58:33] in you
[58:34] they struggle recognizing the bride's
[58:36] presence and authority on the earth
[58:38] but she's here as a witness now the land
[58:40] that could be as perfect as it can be
[58:42] but if that lamb was just tied to the
[58:44] front door
[58:46] the token was not applied
[58:49] if they kill the lamb and they and they
[58:51] got the blood and they put it in a basin
[58:52] right by the door if it wasn't applied
[58:55] the death angel struck their home
[58:56] the blood the lamb had to be taken it
[58:59] had to be killed
[59:00] the blood had to be applied then they
[59:02] had to eat the very lamb
[59:04] that was protecting them from the death
[59:05] angel
[59:08] so the token the holy ghost is what
[59:09] protects us from the death angel in the
[59:12] land
[59:12] and we are to be eating the very lamb
[59:15] the very word that is your protection we
[59:17] are to be eating it
[59:19] while the death angel passes in the land
[59:22] you're safe
[59:23] while there's chaos in egypt you're in
[59:25] goshen with the token applied
[59:29] so the blood cannot just remain at the
[59:31] door it had to be applied
[59:34] it had to prove that there was a living
[59:36] thing that
[59:37] died for you
[59:40] now the token as i said is the literal
[59:43] life of jesus christ
[59:45] that's what the holy ghost did it is not
[59:47] an idea it is not a change of mind
[59:49] it is not a statement of faith it's not
[59:50] a doctrine
[59:52] the holy ghost is literally that life
[59:56] the lord jesus christ from 2000 years
[1:00:00] ago
[1:00:00] now living in 2021 that is the holy
[1:00:03] ghost
[1:00:04] that is the token and that is the only
[1:00:06] thing that will protect us in this end
[1:00:07] time
[1:00:09] now the letter of this word the bible by
[1:00:13] itself like this
[1:00:14] that's not the token people carry this
[1:00:18] to church every time they go to church
[1:00:22] and they don't have the token can i say
[1:00:25] that people carry this to church
[1:00:27] and won't have the token the token is
[1:00:30] what brought this the token is what
[1:00:32] wrote this
[1:00:33] but just carrying the letters or having
[1:00:35] it stacked up in our homes
[1:00:37] we're having pictures on the wall that's
[1:00:39] not the token
[1:00:40] the token is the life that sent this
[1:00:43] that is the token people can
[1:00:47] read the bible from cover to cover
[1:00:51] constantly and live like a devil
[1:00:54] people can listen to tapes or read the
[1:00:56] same message books you do that changed
[1:00:58] your life
[1:00:59] and live like a devil what's the
[1:01:00] difference they don't have the life that
[1:01:02] sent it
[1:01:04] that's what we're preaching to you this
[1:01:05] evening is that you need the life
[1:01:07] that sent that you need the same life
[1:01:09] that wrote the bible you need it in your
[1:01:11] life
[1:01:12] to overcome the same way them saints
[1:01:14] overcame
[1:01:18] so an intellectual believer can have all
[1:01:20] the tapes and books and bible and
[1:01:21] everything else they want
[1:01:23] if it doesn't live that's not the token
[1:01:28] it's not the token it is the literal
[1:01:30] life of jesus christ in you
[1:01:34] rahab when she was living in jericho she
[1:01:37] was living in a city
[1:01:38] that was actually judged already god had
[1:01:41] already told joshua
[1:01:42] you kill everyone you kill
[1:01:45] everything man woman
[1:01:48] boy girl child baby you kill them all
[1:01:53] now that can sound harsh in the natural
[1:01:55] but you have to understand then babies
[1:01:56] will grow
[1:01:57] and that is why these little devils that
[1:01:59] try and creep up they have to be dealt
[1:02:01] with
[1:02:02] because little devils grow into big
[1:02:03] devils
[1:02:05] little problems grow into big problems
[1:02:07] that aren't dealt with
[1:02:10] so you have it's the little foxes that
[1:02:11] spoil the vine
[1:02:13] so rahab received
[1:02:16] receive the spies but that wasn't
[1:02:20] applying the token yet
[1:02:22] she believed what the spy said but that
[1:02:25] wasn't applying the token yet
[1:02:28] she hid the spies on her roof but that
[1:02:31] was not applying the token
[1:02:32] she let them down and let them escape
[1:02:34] but that was not applying the token yet
[1:02:36] but when rahab's whose house was on the
[1:02:38] wall when she let that scarlet cord
[1:02:41] and she left it out of her window at
[1:02:43] that time she applied the token
[1:02:46] because she proved that she believed
[1:02:48] what the message of the messengers
[1:02:51] by doing what they said
[1:02:54] how can you even prove to your spouse
[1:02:56] that you love them if you don't do what
[1:02:58] they ask if you don't in humility
[1:03:00] and and how can y'all even get along how
[1:03:02] do you how do we prove to our lord or
[1:03:04] our heavenly husband that we love him if
[1:03:06] we don't do what he said
[1:03:09] how do we say that we believe the
[1:03:10] message if we don't do what the message
[1:03:12] said now that cannot be done in the
[1:03:15] flesh it's got to be the holy ghost and
[1:03:17] you live in it
[1:03:20] you sisters don't wear your long hair
[1:03:22] because
[1:03:23] it's some some grievous commandment
[1:03:26] you do it to be pleasing unto the lord
[1:03:29] because you know that's what your
[1:03:30] husband wants
[1:03:32] you brothers don't live a clean decent
[1:03:33] godly life because you're just afraid
[1:03:35] that your wife will leave you you do it
[1:03:37] because
[1:03:37] it pleases the lord and he works all
[1:03:41] them things out
[1:03:42] so rahab applied the token by putting
[1:03:44] the scarlet cord in the window that was
[1:03:46] the token
[1:03:47] so whenever the destroying angel came
[1:03:50] joshua and the army of israel on the
[1:03:52] walls fell all around them
[1:03:54] you can imagine the sounds of death
[1:03:58] all around the screaming the groaning
[1:04:02] all the sounds but rahab was safe with
[1:04:05] her family
[1:04:07] underneath that token if she would have
[1:04:10] done
[1:04:10] everything that she did but did not put
[1:04:12] that cord out
[1:04:14] she would have died so what do you so
[1:04:18] what am i saying
[1:04:19] you can we a person can intellectually
[1:04:22] believe this message
[1:04:23] believe god sent a prophet and missed
[1:04:24] the token that that's what
[1:04:26] that's what i want to awaken you to
[1:04:31] that it's possible to intellectually be
[1:04:33] an intellectual believer and miss
[1:04:35] the gift giver to miss the life to miss
[1:04:39] the token we can't do that
[1:04:41] we have got to possess the token
[1:04:44] and then the the death angel will pass
[1:04:46] over us
[1:04:48] so no matter of all the death that was
[1:04:50] all around
[1:04:52] rahab was safe in her home and when it
[1:04:54] was all said and done her home was the
[1:04:56] only one that was standing
[1:05:01] and these services that we come twice
[1:05:05] a week by god's grace we come here
[1:05:10] to become more like jesus to get more of
[1:05:12] his life
[1:05:14] we don't come here to talk of natural
[1:05:16] things
[1:05:17] that's not the that's not that's not the
[1:05:19] reason that we should be coming here
[1:05:22] the reason that we should be coming is
[1:05:23] that when we walk out of them doors
[1:05:25] we're better than when we came in and
[1:05:28] the only way is to hear what the spirit
[1:05:29] of the lord is saying in every service
[1:05:33] peter in first peter 1 18 for as much as
[1:05:36] ye know
[1:05:37] that you were not redeemed with
[1:05:38] corruptible things as silver and gold
[1:05:40] from your vain conversation received
[1:05:42] by the tradition of your elders of your
[1:05:44] fathers
[1:05:45] but with the precious blood of christ
[1:05:49] as of a lamb without blemish and without
[1:05:51] spot
[1:05:52] who verily was foreordained before the
[1:05:55] foundation of the world
[1:05:57] but was manifest in these last times for
[1:05:59] you
[1:06:01] you're bought with the price the bible
[1:06:02] says you're bought
[1:06:04] with the precious blood of jesus christ
[1:06:08] not just a natural lamb not just an
[1:06:11] animal you're bought with
[1:06:12] literally the blood brother graham
[1:06:14] called it the blood of god
[1:06:16] you're bought with a price you're you he
[1:06:19] paid your ransom
[1:06:21] satan had us bound in sin and death and
[1:06:25] unbelief
[1:06:26] but he paid your ransom brother donnie
[1:06:29] he paid your ransom so that you could go
[1:06:31] free
[1:06:33] because remember the life of the lamb
[1:06:35] could not justify or come back
[1:06:38] on the believer but the life of that
[1:06:40] great lamb of god
[1:06:41] has come back and that is the token i'm
[1:06:44] preaching to you about this evening
[1:06:47] now it's very important because israel
[1:06:49] in the first exodus was only a type or
[1:06:51] shadow
[1:06:51] brother ram called himself a typologist
[1:06:55] what's very important when you study the
[1:06:56] scriptures when you're reading the bible
[1:06:58] when you're you're studying the
[1:06:59] prophet's message
[1:07:00] it's very important to rightly divide
[1:07:03] the shadows and the types because
[1:07:05] remember those types and shadows don't
[1:07:07] fail
[1:07:08] whenever there's a shadow as brother ram
[1:07:10] described it it gets kind of more it's
[1:07:11] kind of blurry you can kind of see a
[1:07:12] picture as it gets closer and closer
[1:07:15] and then comes from the tight to the
[1:07:16] anti-type so how much greater was that
[1:07:19] lamb of god than the land that they
[1:07:20] killed in egypt
[1:07:22] so to give you some examples is noah is
[1:07:24] a type of the bride
[1:07:26] noah was safe in the ark before the
[1:07:28] judgment fell
[1:07:29] the ark is a type of christ amen but
[1:07:32] because the word is like a diamond
[1:07:35] when you're over here you see noah being
[1:07:38] a type of the bride
[1:07:39] but when you step over here you actually
[1:07:41] see that enoch is the type of the bride
[1:07:43] and noah is the type of the church that
[1:07:45] goes through the tribulation period
[1:07:47] you understand you see brother brown
[1:07:49] preached a message about lot
[1:07:51] he always refers to lot he preached that
[1:07:53] the bride
[1:07:54] before the first speck of fire falls
[1:07:58] we're going to be out of here if you
[1:08:01] have the token
[1:08:02] you're going to be out of here it's a
[1:08:03] guarantee now he gets that type from lot
[1:08:06] before
[1:08:07] one bit of fire fell down of fire and
[1:08:10] brimstone fell
[1:08:11] on sodom and gomorrah a lot was out so
[1:08:13] the lot types the bride
[1:08:15] if you're standing over here but if you
[1:08:17] move over here
[1:08:18] on this part of the diamond the lot is
[1:08:21] actually the carnal believer in sodom
[1:08:22] and abraham types you who was never down
[1:08:24] inside them
[1:08:25] so it's important that you understand
[1:08:27] where you're looking from brother
[1:08:29] gabriel
[1:08:29] it's very important that when you read
[1:08:30] the word you have an understanding of
[1:08:33] where you're sitting
[1:08:34] and how you're reading the word
[1:08:38] israel was the type of the bride
[1:08:40] applying the token
[1:08:42] when you're standing at this angle but
[1:08:44] when you come over here on this angle
[1:08:46] you see that israel failed at cades
[1:08:48] barnea
[1:08:48] and didn't go on with the word and they
[1:08:50] died in the wilderness
[1:08:53] the jews are very proud people of their
[1:08:55] lineage
[1:08:56] when jesus was on the earth they were
[1:08:59] bragging about how their fathers ate man
[1:09:00] in the wilderness and how they drank
[1:09:02] from the rock and who are you to tell us
[1:09:03] is our fathers did this
[1:09:05] and our fathers did that paul later
[1:09:08] picks it up and he says more ever
[1:09:09] moreover brethren i would not that ye
[1:09:11] should be ignorant how all of our
[1:09:13] fathers were under the cloud
[1:09:15] and all pass through the sea and we're
[1:09:17] all baptized unto moses in the cloud and
[1:09:19] in the sea and did all eat of the same
[1:09:21] spiritual meat
[1:09:23] and did all drink of that same spiritual
[1:09:25] drink
[1:09:26] for they drank of that spiritual rock
[1:09:28] that followed them and that rock was
[1:09:29] christ
[1:09:31] but with many of them god was not well
[1:09:33] pleased for they were overthrown
[1:09:34] in the wilderness so the jews loved to
[1:09:37] brag about their lineage as i said
[1:09:39] they told jesus our fathers did eat man
[1:09:41] in the wilderness
[1:09:43] and jesus admitted your fathers did eat
[1:09:46] man in the wilderness
[1:09:48] but they're everyone dead
[1:09:51] they were spiritually separated from god
[1:09:54] because they could not
[1:09:55] go on with the word
[1:09:59] jesus later breaks it down in that same
[1:10:01] chapter and he said in saint john 6 53
[1:10:04] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[1:10:07] i say unto you
[1:10:08] except ye eat the flesh of the son of
[1:10:10] man and drink his blood
[1:10:12] you have no life in you who so eateth my
[1:10:15] flesh
[1:10:16] and drinketh my blood hath eternal life
[1:10:19] and
[1:10:19] i will raise him up at the last day for
[1:10:22] my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is
[1:10:24] drink indeed
[1:10:25] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:10:27] blood dwelleth in me
[1:10:29] and i in him as the living father had
[1:10:32] sent me and i live by the father
[1:10:34] so he that eateth me even he shall live
[1:10:36] by me
[1:10:37] this is that bread
[1:10:40] which came down from heaven not as your
[1:10:43] fathers did eat manna and are
[1:10:45] dead he that eateth of this bread
[1:10:48] shall live forever so you had a nation
[1:10:51] of very religious people
[1:10:53] who were bragging on everything their
[1:10:55] fathers did and jesus said they ate of
[1:10:57] that manna but they're dead
[1:10:59] but they that eat of this manna
[1:11:02] they'll eat and they'll never die
[1:11:04] they'll never perish he didn't mean for
[1:11:06] them to literally
[1:11:07] cannibalize his body
[1:11:11] but we're eating his flesh the word
[1:11:14] and we're drinking his blood the spirit
[1:11:18] and he promised that he that eateth of
[1:11:21] that bread
[1:11:22] will live forever in hebrews 10
[1:11:26] by the which will we are sanctified
[1:11:28] through the offering of the body of
[1:11:30] jesus christ
[1:11:31] once for all and every priest standeth
[1:11:34] ministering and offering often the same
[1:11:36] sacrifices
[1:11:38] which can never take away sins but this
[1:11:40] man
[1:11:41] after he had offered one sacrifice
[1:11:44] for sins forever
[1:11:47] sat down at the right hand of god from
[1:11:50] henceforth expect until his enemies be
[1:11:52] made
[1:11:53] his footstool for by one offering he
[1:11:56] hath perfected for
[1:11:57] ever them that are sanctified whereof
[1:12:00] the holy ghost also is a witness to us
[1:12:02] for after that he said before this is
[1:12:05] the covenant
[1:12:06] that i will make with him after those
[1:12:08] they sayeth the lord i will put my laws
[1:12:10] into their hearts
[1:12:12] and in their minds will i write them and
[1:12:14] their sins
[1:12:15] and iniquities will i remember no
[1:12:18] more that is the difference between the
[1:12:23] lamb
[1:12:23] they did in egypt and our lamb of god
[1:12:27] ephesians 4 30 said and grieve not the
[1:12:30] holy spirit of god
[1:12:31] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[1:12:34] your redemption
[1:12:36] now when god gives you the holy ghost
[1:12:38] it's yours
[1:12:39] for eternity when god gives you the holy
[1:12:43] ghost it is your inheritance
[1:12:45] and the holy ghost is given to you by
[1:12:48] predestination
[1:12:50] you say what does that mean god knew
[1:12:52] that you would make it
[1:12:54] so he don't give you the holy ghost here
[1:12:56] not that because he's going to lose you
[1:12:58] there
[1:12:58] he gives you the holy ghost here knowing
[1:13:01] that you're going to make it
[1:13:02] all of the way because it's the holy
[1:13:04] ghost that makes it all the way not you
[1:13:06] it's not our flesh that makes anything
[1:13:08] it's not our flesh that overcomes it's
[1:13:10] not our flesh that
[1:13:11] that lives a spiritual life the only
[1:13:14] reason that
[1:13:15] any one of us like to be around any one
[1:13:17] of us
[1:13:20] is because of him that's the only reason
[1:13:24] that is the only reason you enjoy being
[1:13:27] around
[1:13:27] another person is because of him
[1:13:32] because of the atmosphere that you may
[1:13:34] have
[1:13:36] and we as christians should be like
[1:13:38] trees planted by the rivers of water
[1:13:40] rooted and grounded in christ jesus
[1:13:42] bringing forth fruit
[1:13:45] his fruit the fruit of jesus christ the
[1:13:47] fruits of the spirit
[1:13:49] where people can come on the job and ask
[1:13:51] you brother jeff i need you to pray for
[1:13:53] me
[1:13:55] they may not be a christian but they
[1:13:58] know that you are so they're going to
[1:13:59] come to you
[1:14:00] for prayer why is that they're under
[1:14:02] your tree
[1:14:03] and they're refreshing themselves with
[1:14:05] the fruit
[1:14:08] so you offer shade you offer
[1:14:12] goodness and you offer wisdom and you
[1:14:14] offer testimonies you offer
[1:14:16] the word you offer comfort
[1:14:19] to people that don't have it and god
[1:14:23] puts every single one of you
[1:14:25] in situations where you can do that
[1:14:29] nobody goes to lay under a cactus
[1:14:32] nobody goes to lean over a cactus it's
[1:14:34] so hot today i need some shade
[1:14:36] here's a cactus but people can act can
[1:14:40] be cactuses
[1:14:43] and even they bloom a couple times a
[1:14:45] year
[1:14:48] easter and christmas
[1:14:51] but where to be fruit trees
[1:14:56] where to be fruit trees where people can
[1:14:59] come that don't know jesus christ and be
[1:15:01] refreshed under your tree
[1:15:03] they can be refreshing your tree because
[1:15:05] you're rooted and grounded you're
[1:15:06] drawing
[1:15:07] in an area they don't know anything
[1:15:08] about you're planted by the river of
[1:15:10] life
[1:15:12] and you're drawing water and nutrients
[1:15:13] and you're pushing it out in your fruit
[1:15:16] and people come and partake of it
[1:15:20] and if they ask where did you get such a
[1:15:21] good fruit this fruit is so good
[1:15:23] where can i get some fruit like that
[1:15:25] where can i get some shade like that
[1:15:27] where can i get an atmosphere like that
[1:15:28] where can i get a marriage like that
[1:15:30] where can i get a family like that
[1:15:32] you then are in a position to testify of
[1:15:35] where you're planted
[1:15:38] so the holy ghost is given to you based
[1:15:39] on predestination god
[1:15:41] knows that you're going to make it
[1:15:44] and the token when god gives you the
[1:15:47] token sister carly
[1:15:48] when god gives you the token it is your
[1:15:50] receipt and you have proof that you have
[1:15:54] been bought
[1:15:55] and paid for and satan can never take
[1:15:57] you back
[1:15:58] because you've already been bought and
[1:16:00] paid for by his precious blood
[1:16:02] in the old testament the bible said that
[1:16:04] we're not redeemed by corruptable things
[1:16:06] they had to redeem one another when
[1:16:08] they're sold in slavery with silver
[1:16:10] but now we're redeemed by the precious
[1:16:13] blood of the lamb
[1:16:14] the token life of jesus christ
[1:16:17] we're you're not children you're not
[1:16:19] redeemed with corruptable things
[1:16:20] you're not your redemption price is not
[1:16:23] susceptible to inflation
[1:16:26] it is bought and paid for and the token
[1:16:28] that you carry
[1:16:30] this isn't the receipt paper is this
[1:16:34] isn't the receipt the paper
[1:16:35] this isn't just the receipt the paper
[1:16:38] the receipt is within you the kingdom of
[1:16:40] god is within you
[1:16:41] what you read in this then becomes goes
[1:16:44] into you
[1:16:46] and then channels itself into your soul
[1:16:48] and then you live it out
[1:16:50] and then you're written epistles read
[1:16:52] and known of all men
[1:16:55] when this becomes channeled into you
[1:16:58] then the life that sent this the life
[1:17:01] that sent this and wrote this it is then
[1:17:03] being channeled through you
[1:17:06] that is the token that
[1:17:10] is the life of jesus christ
[1:17:13] that is hebrews 13 8.
[1:17:16] jesus christ has claimed you
[1:17:20] when you have that token and he gives
[1:17:22] you that token
[1:17:23] that is proof that he has claimed you
[1:17:26] and he's saying you belong to me
[1:17:28] you don't belong to the devil i came and
[1:17:30] i bought you
[1:17:31] with my own blood not the blood of a
[1:17:34] second person
[1:17:35] not the blood of a third person not the
[1:17:37] blood of an angel
[1:17:38] i paid for it god paid for our salvation
[1:17:43] and he sent the token back as proof that
[1:17:46] he paid for it
[1:17:47] he sent the token as proof that he
[1:17:49] resurrected
[1:17:53] so as israel was in goshen while egypt
[1:17:55] was going on
[1:17:56] while people were going to their jobs
[1:17:58] while people were all involved in a
[1:18:00] tizzy about politics or the world
[1:18:02] systems
[1:18:02] and looking for some superman to come
[1:18:04] maybe worried about who's going to be
[1:18:05] the next pharaoh
[1:18:07] god was sent a prophet to israel right
[1:18:09] there in goshen
[1:18:10] and while there was darkness all the way
[1:18:12] around the bible said the darkness could
[1:18:14] be felt can you feel the darkness out in
[1:18:15] the world
[1:18:16] well that darkness is being so dark you
[1:18:18] can feel it
[1:18:19] you've got light you're here now
[1:18:21] enjoying the presence of god
[1:18:22] you're getting deliverance you're being
[1:18:24] healed you're being encouraged
[1:18:26] why because you're in goshen because you
[1:18:28] heard a prophet because you got the
[1:18:29] blood to atone for you
[1:18:32] that is the difference so as the as
[1:18:36] israel was in goshen
[1:18:38] we're sitting here and ladies going on
[1:18:40] all around us
[1:18:41] but you're seated in heavenly places in
[1:18:43] christ jesus
[1:18:45] brother graham said and god's provided a
[1:18:47] place of worship
[1:18:48] now notice when this great moving power
[1:18:50] of god comes into a son of god
[1:18:53] it quickens him the spirit of life
[1:18:56] enters into him
[1:18:57] then what does it do it seats them in
[1:18:59] heavenly places right now
[1:19:01] not they will be we are
[1:19:04] now now we've already resurrected the
[1:19:07] dynamics
[1:19:08] mechanics has gone to work quickened us
[1:19:11] and we're quickened
[1:19:12] up into the presence of god where his
[1:19:15] spirit is
[1:19:17] now let me deal with dynamics and
[1:19:18] mechanics really fast
[1:19:21] the mechanics is when you know what the
[1:19:24] word says
[1:19:25] you have an understanding of what the
[1:19:27] word says
[1:19:28] the dynamics is the spirit that makes it
[1:19:32] move
[1:19:32] that makes it live now you have people
[1:19:36] that because god promised that the
[1:19:37] spirit would fall on the just and the
[1:19:38] unjust and you have people that can act
[1:19:40] in the dynamics
[1:19:42] and they act in the emotion but they
[1:19:43] don't have the life
[1:19:45] they can't live the life then you have
[1:19:48] people that can intellectually they're
[1:19:51] mental believers and they have an
[1:19:52] understanding
[1:19:53] and from a mental perspective of what
[1:19:55] the word says
[1:19:57] or what the message says but they can't
[1:19:59] make it live
[1:20:01] but when you put the dynamics and the
[1:20:03] mechanics together
[1:20:04] that is what moves the church that is
[1:20:07] what moves the holy ghost to a believer
[1:20:10] so to go on and now we're seated
[1:20:12] together
[1:20:13] in heavenly places in christ jesus in
[1:20:16] christ jesus sitting
[1:20:18] in there that's already fired up been
[1:20:20] raised from the dead we're a part of it
[1:20:22] if you're a part of the bride
[1:20:24] you are because the bride is part of the
[1:20:26] groom
[1:20:27] you know so we find out it's the same
[1:20:30] thing and she'll do just exactly
[1:20:32] what's predicted for her to do in this
[1:20:34] day
[1:20:36] she won't be a lady elsia not by no
[1:20:40] means a lukewarm
[1:20:42] but she'll be on fire for god she'll be
[1:20:45] moving on in the spirit of god
[1:20:49] the world we live in is insane
[1:20:52] a child could tell you that they try and
[1:20:55] normalize i told my our kids
[1:20:57] i said they try and make blue hair and
[1:21:00] green hair
[1:21:01] and purple hair and rainbow hair and
[1:21:03] unicorn hair and glitter hair
[1:21:04] they try and make it normal it's not
[1:21:08] normal it's satanic it's satanic
[1:21:13] influence
[1:21:14] that's causing that it's not normal but
[1:21:16] what what is the enemy doing
[1:21:17] trying to desensitize us and our
[1:21:20] children
[1:21:22] to the world never be desensitized from
[1:21:25] the world let it shock you
[1:21:26] every time
[1:21:29] let it be weird every time
[1:21:33] i'm not that old but when i was a
[1:21:34] teenager when we seen somebody like that
[1:21:36] in walmart
[1:21:37] i not only was looking but so was
[1:21:39] everyone else around
[1:21:41] now nobody seems to pay much mind
[1:21:44] maybe they're afraid to i don't know but
[1:21:46] never lose the
[1:21:47] never lose your sensitivity to wrong
[1:21:50] always keep your guard up always discern
[1:21:53] right from wrong
[1:21:55] every every little commercial you see
[1:21:57] every every ad you may see on the
[1:21:59] internet keep your guard up
[1:22:02] to say that's wrong that's the enemy
[1:22:04] being sneaky
[1:22:05] because when the enemy is sneaky here
[1:22:08] all of a sudden you accept that
[1:22:10] and then he gets a little sneakier and
[1:22:11] he gets a little sneakier and he gets a
[1:22:13] little sneakier and then one day you'll
[1:22:14] realize you slid from way over there
[1:22:17] discern the enemy and his tactics
[1:22:21] recognize the enemy and his tactics
[1:22:23] recognize the enemy trying to come into
[1:22:25] your home
[1:22:26] recognize the enemy trying to come into
[1:22:28] your marriage recognize the enemy study
[1:22:30] his tactics
[1:22:33] recognize that enemy because he's very
[1:22:37] slick
[1:22:39] he's very slick we have to be careful
[1:22:41] what we listen to
[1:22:43] we have to be careful what we watch
[1:22:45] there was a testimony i don't remember
[1:22:47] exactly where but where this one young
[1:22:48] lady had an awful problem i'd been with
[1:22:50] nervousness it was something i don't
[1:22:51] recall exactly
[1:22:53] and brother brand the prophet of god
[1:22:54] prayed for her
[1:22:56] and when he prayed for her he seen an
[1:22:58] evil spirit in the shape like a buffalo
[1:23:00] raised up out of her
[1:23:02] the cause of that was because when she
[1:23:05] was a child she seen a documentary on
[1:23:07] the holocaust
[1:23:08] and seeing that documentary remember the
[1:23:10] eyes of the channel to the soul
[1:23:12] so seeing that that documentary about
[1:23:14] the holocaust affected this little girl
[1:23:16] so bad as a child a spirit entered into
[1:23:19] her
[1:23:20] and caused her problems her whole life
[1:23:23] we have to be careful very careful what
[1:23:25] we watch we have to be very careful what
[1:23:27] we let our children watch
[1:23:30] we have to be very careful because satan
[1:23:32] is slick
[1:23:38] and if he can't get to you he'll try and
[1:23:39] get to your wife or try and get to your
[1:23:41] family he'll try and get your children
[1:23:43] we have to be on guard now god has a
[1:23:46] chosen place of worship
[1:23:48] and as i said earlier people always want
[1:23:50] to do things their way
[1:23:53] they always have a problem with god
[1:23:54] saying this is the way i want it
[1:23:57] and if you want to be accepted you've
[1:23:58] got to come this way
[1:24:00] now you'll have one side you know the
[1:24:02] truth is always in the middle
[1:24:05] you'll have one side that'll say there's
[1:24:07] many ways to heaven
[1:24:09] coexist with all the other religions
[1:24:11] there's so many ways to new york
[1:24:14] you just come in way whatever suits you
[1:24:16] that's a lie of the devil
[1:24:19] then you have on this other side of the
[1:24:21] extreme spectrum you have
[1:24:23] you'll take just a random church out in
[1:24:25] the city and you'll say if they'll
[1:24:26] believe if they don't believe
[1:24:28] like exactly like me if they don't have
[1:24:32] their name on
[1:24:32] our church book if they don't belong to
[1:24:35] our denomination
[1:24:37] you're lost you've got no chance this is
[1:24:40] the only way
[1:24:42] but my bible tells me that he said he
[1:24:44] was the only way
[1:24:46] and he is the word so it's not
[1:24:50] if you don't believe like me if you
[1:24:52] don't believe like brother andrew if you
[1:24:54] don't believe
[1:24:54] your co-worker you don't we have to
[1:24:56] believe like he believes
[1:24:58] and this is what god believes because do
[1:25:00] you know who the first believer was
[1:25:03] god he believed his own word
[1:25:06] when he said let there be light god
[1:25:08] believed brother braham said his own
[1:25:10] word
[1:25:11] and it brought to pass exactly what he
[1:25:13] believed so in order for you so i'll put
[1:25:15] it like this
[1:25:16] in order for you to get to heaven you've
[1:25:18] got to believe like god believes
[1:25:21] it's not because i believe it or because
[1:25:24] this single church believes
[1:25:26] it you have to believe what he believes
[1:25:28] how what does god believe
[1:25:29] right here you want to know what god
[1:25:32] believes right here
[1:25:35] and jesus christ is the only
[1:25:38] way to heaven jesus christ the word he
[1:25:42] is the word
[1:25:43] it is he is the only way
[1:25:46] because there's a right way and there's
[1:25:49] the wrong way
[1:25:50] and the token the token that we're
[1:25:53] preaching
[1:25:54] of can only be applied in god's chosen
[1:25:57] place of worship
[1:25:59] now i'm going to say that again the
[1:26:01] token
[1:26:02] can only be applied in god's
[1:26:05] chosen place of worship
[1:26:08] god's chosen place of worship is jesus
[1:26:11] christ
[1:26:12] that is the only place to get the holy
[1:26:14] ghost
[1:26:16] you cannot get it any other place jesus
[1:26:18] said in matthew 15 9 think of this
[1:26:21] he says but in vain they do worship me
[1:26:26] this is god himself saying in vain they
[1:26:29] do worship me teaching for doctrine the
[1:26:30] commandments of men
[1:26:32] you mean to say that there's actual
[1:26:34] churches and there's big
[1:26:35] programs and there's big rope choirs and
[1:26:37] there's this and there's that
[1:26:38] and all that is for vain all that does
[1:26:41] no good
[1:26:42] that's what he said in vain they do
[1:26:45] worship me why do they worship me in
[1:26:47] vain because they're not coming god's
[1:26:48] provided way
[1:26:50] god has a provided way and they want
[1:26:51] their own provided way
[1:26:54] when he met the woman at the well he
[1:26:56] said but the hour cometh
[1:26:58] and now is when true worshipers shall
[1:27:01] worship the father
[1:27:02] in spirit and in truth
[1:27:07] for the father seeketh such to worship
[1:27:09] him
[1:27:10] god seeks for true worship
[1:27:14] because we're about to get into
[1:27:16] something but god will reject
[1:27:18] false worship god won't receive it
[1:27:22] if you want to be received of god you've
[1:27:25] got to come god's provided way
[1:27:27] and god's provided way is the holy ghost
[1:27:29] is the new birth
[1:27:30] is the token it's all the same thing
[1:27:34] jesus saith unto him i am the way the
[1:27:37] truth
[1:27:38] and the life no man cometh unto the
[1:27:41] father
[1:27:42] but by me satan hates that scripture
[1:27:46] because if satan can just get the waters
[1:27:48] muddy if he can just get the way that's
[1:27:50] just
[1:27:50] any which way will work whatever you
[1:27:52] feel you only live once whatever the
[1:27:54] spirit of the age is
[1:27:55] that's what satan wants to do you know
[1:27:58] today i believe they had
[1:28:00] was is it prince philip the one that
[1:28:01] just died
[1:28:04] they had his funeral today and they had
[1:28:07] massive pomp and soldiers and all these
[1:28:09] things
[1:28:12] but god is a judge
[1:28:15] but where he is now i don't know and i'm
[1:28:18] not i can't say
[1:28:19] but to make a point where he is now that
[1:28:22] don't matter
[1:28:23] all of his accomplishments and all of
[1:28:25] his titles and all of the pomp
[1:28:26] don't mean nothing now he's an
[1:28:28] individual before god
[1:28:30] every president of the united states
[1:28:31] every king every monarch every dictator
[1:28:34] every emperor
[1:28:34] that ever died they are a soul before
[1:28:38] god
[1:28:38] that must answer for the works that
[1:28:40] they've done and how they
[1:28:42] treated this word they've got to answer
[1:28:46] for that
[1:28:47] so let's not kid ourselves we will be
[1:28:50] required
[1:28:52] to answer if we don't apply this token
[1:28:55] if we have been in service after service
[1:28:57] after service god coming down
[1:28:59] and his service at the service
[1:29:01] vindicating and confirming himself
[1:29:02] confirming his presence among us where
[1:29:05] will we be in that day saints
[1:29:08] we'll have to give a reason
[1:29:12] now in the book of genesis which is the
[1:29:14] c chapter
[1:29:15] cain and abel both worship we're talking
[1:29:19] about god's
[1:29:20] chosen place of worship and we have to
[1:29:23] understand
[1:29:24] that cain naturally speaking he might
[1:29:27] have been
[1:29:27] an okay kind of guy he went to church
[1:29:32] he paid his tithes he was sincere
[1:29:37] and he worshipped the same god that abel
[1:29:39] did
[1:29:40] understand now cain did not worship some
[1:29:43] pagan false god
[1:29:44] cain brought his sacrifice to the same
[1:29:47] god that abel did
[1:29:49] but abel came god's provided way
[1:29:55] brother branham says now those boys
[1:29:58] after seeing that they had been made
[1:29:59] mortal
[1:30:00] and was going to die they tried to find
[1:30:02] favor with god
[1:30:04] and they both come making a sacrifice
[1:30:07] i'll review a certain thing here i said
[1:30:09] last night if god only required religion
[1:30:11] if that's all he required then cain was
[1:30:14] justified
[1:30:16] think about that if all god requires
[1:30:19] brother jim is church attendance
[1:30:22] paying your tithes and being a good
[1:30:24] neighbor and being nice to people
[1:30:26] cain should not have been rejected but
[1:30:29] god requires more
[1:30:32] now it's nothing that we can bring it's
[1:30:36] what he's done
[1:30:37] but you have to understand we have to
[1:30:39] understand that it's our faith
[1:30:40] and what he's done that justifies you
[1:30:44] he said but cain's sacrifice cain comes
[1:30:48] believing just the same as abel did cain
[1:30:51] come with the sacrifice
[1:30:52] just the same as abel came with the
[1:30:54] sacrifice but cain's sacrifice
[1:30:56] was by works he raised the garden
[1:30:59] brought his fruits the best he could
[1:31:01] find by works
[1:31:02] but abel was justified by faith he come
[1:31:05] with a lamb
[1:31:08] now cain they were they both they were
[1:31:11] under sin
[1:31:12] their parents sold out the entire human
[1:31:14] race to sin
[1:31:16] so they were under sin and they knew
[1:31:18] that they had to get back in fellowship
[1:31:20] with god
[1:31:22] so they come and they want they want to
[1:31:24] do it they want to make a sacrifice and
[1:31:26] cain no doubt gave it a lot of thought
[1:31:29] how can i please god
[1:31:32] what can and i want you to notice that
[1:31:34] his reasoning what can
[1:31:35] i do that god will accept
[1:31:39] what can i do what how can i work how
[1:31:42] can i put in them extra hours in my
[1:31:43] garden
[1:31:45] how can i work extra hard and make sure
[1:31:47] i fertilize these
[1:31:49] these fruits and vegetables more than i
[1:31:51] ever have and get everything
[1:31:52] absolutely perfect because you know i
[1:31:54] want the best for my for the lord so
[1:31:58] what can i do
[1:31:59] so cain worked all year
[1:32:02] in his garden and he told and abel was
[1:32:05] probably
[1:32:06] under there under the tree
[1:32:09] maybe praying maybe sleeping i don't
[1:32:11] know
[1:32:12] but cain was over there working in his
[1:32:14] garden and he was doing everything he
[1:32:16] could and he was
[1:32:17] using the sweat of his brow and he was
[1:32:19] trying to prune everything just so
[1:32:20] nicely
[1:32:22] to bring it to god to bring it so he can
[1:32:26] worship god
[1:32:29] so the the process of time came and cain
[1:32:32] thought it out as
[1:32:33] as well as he could to build that altar
[1:32:36] just as beautiful as he can
[1:32:37] and set flowers here and set this over
[1:32:40] here maybe it wasn't just right maybe
[1:32:42] turn it a little bit toward the sun
[1:32:43] and make the sun come right through here
[1:32:45] and shine real nice and bring these
[1:32:47] fruits and
[1:32:47] polish them out a speck of dirt on there
[1:32:50] the most perfect fruit you've ever seen
[1:32:52] delicious fruit wonderful fruit and he's
[1:32:55] setting all this up and he's getting
[1:32:56] ready to offer it to god
[1:32:58] and he looks over and he sees abel his
[1:33:00] brother
[1:33:02] who evidently to cain didn't put no
[1:33:06] effort
[1:33:08] dragging a lamb
[1:33:12] to a rock
[1:33:18] all that work king did
[1:33:21] all that time he put into his garden
[1:33:26] all that knowledge that went into
[1:33:27] cultivation
[1:33:30] all that time that went into decorating
[1:33:32] this beautiful altar for the lord
[1:33:36] and what can abel is he's going to get
[1:33:39] turned down sure is the world
[1:33:42] how is god going to accept that how is
[1:33:44] god going to accept a lamb
[1:33:46] how is god going to accept some some
[1:33:48] stinking lamb
[1:33:51] his altar is a big rock somewhere how
[1:33:54] primitive
[1:33:56] wait till god sees what i did
[1:34:00] wait till he sees what i did
[1:34:04] so he sets everything up
[1:34:08] and when god comes down he leaves cain's
[1:34:11] sacrifice sitting right there
[1:34:17] because cain brought fruit and botany
[1:34:19] life there's no redemption in botany
[1:34:21] life
[1:34:22] adam and eve try to hide behind fig
[1:34:24] leaves
[1:34:26] they had to hide they hid behind botany
[1:34:28] life and god could see
[1:34:30] right through their their religion
[1:34:32] because remember religion is a covering
[1:34:36] we don't want to be religious i don't
[1:34:39] like being called oh
[1:34:40] he's religious i want to be a christian
[1:34:44] i want to be a holy ghost-filled
[1:34:46] believer not religious
[1:34:47] the devil is religious cain was
[1:34:50] religious
[1:34:51] the sadducees were religious judas is a
[1:34:54] carrot was religious
[1:34:55] we don't want to be religious we want to
[1:34:57] have the token we want to have the life
[1:35:03] there's no redemption in botany life
[1:35:04] there's only redemption in blood
[1:35:10] when adam and eve sew that fig leaf
[1:35:13] god had to kill an innocent lamb that
[1:35:15] innocent lamb sister stephanie didn't do
[1:35:17] a thing
[1:35:19] that innocent lamb didn't fall adam and
[1:35:21] eve fell
[1:35:22] but god killed that lamb as an innocent
[1:35:25] substitute for them
[1:35:31] abel offered unto god paul said a more
[1:35:34] excellent sacrifice
[1:35:36] than cain did he brought the lamb
[1:35:40] because abel knew
[1:35:42] that without a sacrifice he was helpless
[1:35:45] abel understood that without blood being
[1:35:48] shed
[1:35:49] there was no forgiveness there was no
[1:35:51] covering for sins
[1:35:55] abel no doubt watched his flock
[1:36:00] and when he knew that time of sacrifice
[1:36:02] was coming he was watching his flocks
[1:36:03] because he was a shepherd
[1:36:05] and he was watching his flocks and he
[1:36:07] was looking for that perfect lamb
[1:36:10] because remember all the way down in
[1:36:11] egypt god told them it had to be a
[1:36:12] perfect lamb
[1:36:13] and we need to give god our best our
[1:36:16] best time
[1:36:17] our best ability our best strength we
[1:36:19] need to give him our best
[1:36:21] so abel was watching which lamb if maybe
[1:36:24] he was watching a certain lamb and then
[1:36:25] maybe kind of
[1:36:26] maybe stepped in a hole maybe kind of
[1:36:28] broke his foot nope that one that one's
[1:36:29] not gonna work
[1:36:31] i gotta find a perfect lamb
[1:36:35] so he found this lamb he found this lamb
[1:36:39] and and he prophet of god said that he
[1:36:41] typed he
[1:36:42] he tied a grapevine around it around its
[1:36:45] neck
[1:36:46] so cain was sitting there and had
[1:36:47] everything so polished and right when he
[1:36:49] thought
[1:36:50] that everything was so perfect and so
[1:36:52] right and god was getting ready to come
[1:36:54] and just consume his sacrifice
[1:36:56] he looks over and he sees abel as i said
[1:36:58] walk on that lamb
[1:37:00] so what's able doing what is able going
[1:37:03] to do with that lamb
[1:37:05] with that stinking lamb what what's he
[1:37:08] gonna do
[1:37:09] so abel drags that lamb he carries that
[1:37:12] lamb
[1:37:13] and he lays it down on that rock
[1:37:18] on that big rock that he made as an
[1:37:20] altar
[1:37:21] and cain and cain is watching and abel
[1:37:23] reaches down he grabs a sharp rock
[1:37:25] and he starts hacking he starts hacking
[1:37:29] he starts hacking at the neck of that
[1:37:32] lamb blood starts going
[1:37:33] everywhere blood gets on the rock blood
[1:37:36] gets on the lamb blood gets on him
[1:37:38] it's a mess
[1:37:42] but god said that's exactly what i'm
[1:37:46] thinking
[1:37:48] the prophet of god said that he came
[1:37:50] down and consumed
[1:37:52] his sacrifice with that pillar of fire
[1:37:55] and left abel's or left canes rather
[1:37:57] just
[1:37:57] sitting there all that work all that
[1:38:00] time in his garden all that works that
[1:38:02] he did
[1:38:03] god i did this for you and i did this
[1:38:05] and i did this there's
[1:38:06] nothing you can do to merit salvation
[1:38:10] you can only look to the lamb
[1:38:14] and the new birth just like abel's
[1:38:15] sacrifice was was a mess
[1:38:17] the new birth is a mess but do you know
[1:38:19] what it's a requirement
[1:38:21] people think they can just come shake
[1:38:23] the preacher's hand or come up with a
[1:38:24] dried-out confession or do
[1:38:25] or just attend church for years and
[1:38:27] years and years and put their name on a
[1:38:28] book
[1:38:29] and think they're going to heaven that's
[1:38:32] an idea from cain
[1:38:34] you need to have a messy birth
[1:38:39] that's what it takes and abel
[1:38:42] had to die on that same rock that that
[1:38:45] lamb died
[1:38:47] he died because whenever cain looked and
[1:38:49] seen
[1:38:50] that god he seen god condescend in the
[1:38:53] pillar of fire
[1:38:54] and consume able sacrifice
[1:38:57] and left mine sitting here
[1:39:00] and cain got jealous and cain got
[1:39:04] so angry and such jealousy rose up
[1:39:07] within him that he killed
[1:39:08] abel on the same rock as his lamb
[1:39:14] abel's revelation cost him his life
[1:39:17] abel's understanding because what abel
[1:39:20] displayed in time
[1:39:22] god had already had already thought of
[1:39:24] in eternity
[1:39:26] jesus christ was the lamb that was slain
[1:39:29] before the foundation of the world
[1:39:31] that was already taken before time
[1:39:33] started before the fall
[1:39:34] god had already in his mind knew what he
[1:39:37] was going to do
[1:39:39] he already knew that you would need a
[1:39:41] redeemer
[1:39:42] that i would need a redeemer before adam
[1:39:44] and eve ever sold us
[1:39:45] out that's the kind of god we serve he
[1:39:48] knows
[1:39:49] exactly what situation you're in right
[1:39:51] now
[1:39:52] before time ever started that's the god
[1:39:56] that we serve
[1:39:59] so we must die to ourselves on the same
[1:40:01] rock
[1:40:02] that jesus christ died on he died on
[1:40:04] mount calvary
[1:40:06] we've got to be he already took our
[1:40:08] penalty
[1:40:09] but we've got to die out to ourselves
[1:40:13] to be born again how did cain when he
[1:40:16] made an altar just as pretty or prettier
[1:40:18] than abel's
[1:40:19] he offered fruits he gave his tithes he
[1:40:22] brought his income into the house of the
[1:40:23] lord he knelt on the altar
[1:40:24] he bowed himself he prayed he worshipped
[1:40:27] just as sincere as any man
[1:40:29] but god vindicated abel by consuming
[1:40:33] his sacrifice remember on mount carmel
[1:40:38] when elijah had a showdown within pagan
[1:40:39] priests and he said let the god that
[1:40:42] answers by fire be god
[1:40:45] and when he laid everything out and
[1:40:47] elijah called on the spirit of the lord
[1:40:49] the pillar of the fire fell
[1:40:50] down from heaven and consumed everything
[1:40:52] the water and everything
[1:40:57] if you say you're a believer god
[1:41:00] vindicates it
[1:41:01] you don't have to presume anything it's
[1:41:04] god consume
[1:41:05] you don't have to presume that's right
[1:41:10] the brass altar consumed the sacrifice
[1:41:12] if the sacrifice laid upon the altar
[1:41:14] and it was not consumed god refused it
[1:41:16] see it's consuming
[1:41:18] and you are god's sacrifice lay yourself
[1:41:21] upon the altar say god
[1:41:23] just take it all out of me empty up so
[1:41:26] you can fill me up
[1:41:28] use me he said that's right don't
[1:41:32] presume it believe it yes sir if you
[1:41:34] don't believe it
[1:41:35] you god won't receive your sacrifice
[1:41:40] we have to lay ourselves completely
[1:41:41] broken completely empty
[1:41:43] completely know that we have nothing to
[1:41:45] bring to god
[1:41:48] nothing nothing as the song says nothing
[1:41:52] in my arms i bring
[1:41:53] simply to thy cross i clean
[1:41:57] once god fills you he can then use you
[1:42:01] but you have to empty yourself out and
[1:42:04] god proves his word
[1:42:06] how does god prove his word by
[1:42:07] vindicating it
[1:42:09] now the word vindicate we talk a lot
[1:42:11] about a vindicated message in this end
[1:42:13] time
[1:42:13] god vindicated this message
[1:42:18] now the word vindicated it means to free
[1:42:22] from allegation or blame
[1:42:26] to provide justification or defense for
[1:42:29] justify see whenever you you are so
[1:42:33] broken
[1:42:34] and you come to god and he sends you're
[1:42:37] so broken god receives your sacrifice of
[1:42:39] brokenness
[1:42:40] of a surrendered heart that he then
[1:42:42] vindicates you
[1:42:43] he justifies you and he fills you with
[1:42:46] the holy ghost
[1:42:50] another definition of vindicate is to
[1:42:53] confirm
[1:42:54] or substantiate how many times would the
[1:42:57] prophet of god preach about abraham and
[1:42:58] sarah
[1:42:59] the woman at the well nathaniel and
[1:43:01] philip and all these different things
[1:43:03] he would preach about it and then god
[1:43:05] would come down and do the exact same
[1:43:07] thing
[1:43:08] that was god vindicating his word
[1:43:13] but don't just look from 50 years ago
[1:43:15] even look
[1:43:16] now the minister will be preaching the
[1:43:19] word
[1:43:21] and then god comes behind it with an
[1:43:23] amen and vindicates it
[1:43:26] if you can believe it
[1:43:32] now just as abel when he when he drug
[1:43:34] that land we can't just
[1:43:35] bring the things of the world to the
[1:43:37] altar we can't just bring our own ideas
[1:43:39] our own intellectual faith and things
[1:43:41] we've got to bring a complete
[1:43:43] surrendered heart and when god
[1:43:45] sees that just like the pillar of fire
[1:43:48] fell
[1:43:49] and consumed abel's sacrifice god will
[1:43:52] come down and consume your sacrifice
[1:43:55] with the token he'll consume your
[1:43:57] sacrifice
[1:43:58] with the holy ghost
[1:44:02] because remember the token is only given
[1:44:04] in god's chosen place of worship
[1:44:07] in hebrews 12 24 into jesus the mediator
[1:44:10] of the new covenant
[1:44:12] into the blood of sprinkling that
[1:44:14] speaketh better things
[1:44:17] than that of abel because when cain
[1:44:19] killed abel abel's blood god said cried
[1:44:22] to him from the ground
[1:44:26] and we find that whenever whenever you
[1:44:29] look over in the book of revelations
[1:44:31] you have the souls under the altar
[1:44:32] crying unto the lord lord how long
[1:44:35] until you avenge us until you avenge our
[1:44:37] blood
[1:44:38] let him say that was the jews there but
[1:44:41] when we have a blood that speaketh
[1:44:42] better things than that of abel
[1:44:44] when he was on the cross what did he say
[1:44:47] he didn't say avenge
[1:44:48] he said forgive them father for they
[1:44:50] know not what they do
[1:44:52] the blood of jesus christ speaks better
[1:44:54] things than that of abel
[1:44:57] so what does the blood of jesus speak if
[1:44:59] the blood of jesus speaks better things
[1:45:01] than that of abel
[1:45:02] what does the blood of jesus speak he
[1:45:04] speaks forgiveness
[1:45:07] he speaks salvation he speaks healing he
[1:45:09] speaks the holy ghost
[1:45:10] this is what the blood of jesus christ
[1:45:12] is speaking right here
[1:45:14] but we have to have an ear to hear
[1:45:21] we must please god
[1:45:24] we must come god's provided way god's
[1:45:28] chosen place of worship you've got to
[1:45:31] please god
[1:45:32] you know you cannot please god with the
[1:45:34] word of a day gone by
[1:45:37] you cannot sit here and please god by
[1:45:39] saying lord
[1:45:40] a flood's coming and let's build an ark
[1:45:42] upon this hill
[1:45:43] because a flood's going to come and and
[1:45:45] we're going to get in this thing
[1:45:47] and we're going to float over it that
[1:45:50] word's already been fulfilled
[1:45:53] you say well that sounds silly well do
[1:45:55] you know that the whole reason that we
[1:45:57] have denominations
[1:45:59] is because that they camped around a
[1:46:01] truth that god had sent at one day
[1:46:05] and when god moved beyond that they
[1:46:06] couldn't move with it
[1:46:09] that is how denominations came to be
[1:46:14] so why hasn't there been you've had
[1:46:16] charismatic come forth after the
[1:46:18] pentecostals
[1:46:18] but why hasn't there been a major
[1:46:20] denomination come after the pentecostals
[1:46:24] it's because we're in seed again you
[1:46:27] can't denominate the truth you can't
[1:46:28] denominate the whole truth
[1:46:31] you can't do it so what went in the
[1:46:33] ground is now
[1:46:35] up top again it's in the fruit that's
[1:46:38] why there hasn't been a denomination
[1:46:40] like i said there's been charismatics
[1:46:42] they've been offshoots and all these
[1:46:43] different things have been going on
[1:46:44] but the pentecostal was the last move of
[1:46:47] god
[1:46:48] that denominated
[1:46:51] so the bleeding word
[1:46:54] we need this token we need the literal
[1:46:58] life of jesus christ that is the only
[1:47:00] way to overcome
[1:47:02] brother graham said think your garments
[1:47:04] washed
[1:47:05] by the water of the bleeding word the
[1:47:08] word become blood the word bled for you
[1:47:11] and you are washed
[1:47:12] in the bleeding word the word bleeding
[1:47:16] he was the word bleeding on the cross
[1:47:18] for you
[1:47:22] he was the word made manifest
[1:47:25] and he died so that he can send his
[1:47:27] token back to you
[1:47:28] by the baptism of the holy ghost and so
[1:47:31] that the death angel can pass over you
[1:47:35] do do we have to understand that
[1:47:37] whenever the bible says that when satan
[1:47:39] comes in like a flood the spirit of god
[1:47:41] raises a standard against it
[1:47:43] do you realize that you as the bride is
[1:47:45] the standard that's raised in this age
[1:47:48] do you realize that hell has literally
[1:47:50] come up and has incarnated itself in the
[1:47:52] people
[1:47:54] just like heaven has come the word and
[1:47:56] has incarnated itself in an end-time
[1:47:58] people
[1:48:01] it's the conflict between god and satan
[1:48:04] and it's in flesh satan will get in
[1:48:07] flesh and possess
[1:48:07] people and cause them to do evil things
[1:48:11] but god is possessing abroad in this end
[1:48:13] time
[1:48:14] and she's going to do exactly what he
[1:48:16] wants done with the word
[1:48:19] now we'll try and bring it to a wrap
[1:48:21] here but let me just read this and i see
[1:48:22] shall possess the gate of the enemy now
[1:48:25] if you say
[1:48:26] oh i'm a believer and god has never
[1:48:29] given you the holy ghost yet
[1:48:31] he's never recognized it you're just
[1:48:34] confessing what you believe
[1:48:36] i'm not saying you're not a believer now
[1:48:37] in a certain portion you are a believer
[1:48:40] but when god has found favor you found
[1:48:42] favor with him rather
[1:48:44] and he recognizes you to be his child
[1:48:47] he knows your heart he and he sees your
[1:48:49] sincerity
[1:48:50] he knows all things are cut away from
[1:48:52] you then he seals you into the kingdom
[1:48:54] of god
[1:48:55] by the holy ghost proving to the world
[1:48:59] that he has accepted what faith you
[1:49:01] profess
[1:49:02] to have in him
[1:49:05] whenever you believe god you say how the
[1:49:07] token you've been preaching for an hour
[1:49:09] or more on what that
[1:49:10] on the token we need the token how do i
[1:49:12] get this token
[1:49:16] you obey the full word
[1:49:20] problem said that the full obedience to
[1:49:23] the word
[1:49:24] entitles you to the token so
[1:49:28] what exactly does that mean you begin
[1:49:30] the word says to repent
[1:49:34] that's the word you say well okay i've
[1:49:37] repented
[1:49:38] now the word says and be baptized
[1:49:43] in the name of jesus christ well i don't
[1:49:45] believe that
[1:49:46] jesus said father son and holy ghost and
[1:49:48] he's more important than peter so i'm
[1:49:49] going to take what jesus said
[1:49:50] and i'm going to be baptizing titles
[1:49:52] well you broke the word right there
[1:49:55] you can't get the token because you
[1:49:57] haven't come to full obedience to the
[1:49:59] word yet
[1:50:02] but then whenever you repent and then
[1:50:04] you are are baptized in spiritual
[1:50:06] and true christian baptism the the
[1:50:10] such a powerful revelation saints is
[1:50:12] that jehovah of the old testament
[1:50:14] is jesus of the new the name of the
[1:50:17] father son and holy ghost is the lord
[1:50:19] jesus christ
[1:50:20] you're obeying the word you're you're
[1:50:22] you're fully obeying the word
[1:50:24] so you repent and then you're baptized
[1:50:26] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:50:29] you're coming on up now then you become
[1:50:32] a candidate for the holy ghost
[1:50:36] then you have to keep believing you got
[1:50:38] to keep pressing you got to you got to
[1:50:39] keep pressing and keep believing and
[1:50:41] trusting god
[1:50:43] and then when god sees your faith as his
[1:50:45] quote said he sees your faith he sees
[1:50:46] your sincerity and when he accepts
[1:50:49] your faith just like he
[1:50:52] accepted abel's sacrifice
[1:50:56] then the fire comes down and consumes
[1:50:58] you then the holy ghost and fire comes
[1:50:59] down and consumes your life
[1:51:02] then try and put it out you can't
[1:51:06] you can't right after brother man
[1:51:09] preached a token he preached
[1:51:10] desperations that would be a really good
[1:51:13] sermon for y'all to listen to
[1:51:14] desperations to get to god no matter
[1:51:18] what you say i've had the holy ghost now
[1:51:19] for years
[1:51:20] get more of god get more get a refilling
[1:51:23] get to you know brother andrew's been
[1:51:25] preaching so wonderfully on surrender a
[1:51:28] full surrender
[1:51:30] let's surrender more than we ever have
[1:51:32] before let's give him more than we ever
[1:51:35] have if we've been holding anything back
[1:51:36] let's give it to him let's give it to
[1:51:37] him
[1:51:38] god will come down and consume that
[1:51:39] portion of your life
[1:51:42] so he in in that summer the desperations
[1:51:44] he's talking about the message of the
[1:51:46] sermon that he just preached that
[1:51:47] morning called the token
[1:51:48] and he said of all the sermons
[1:51:52] this morning the message this morning to
[1:51:55] me
[1:51:56] was the highlight certain message of my
[1:51:58] entire ministry
[1:52:00] this morning see a highlight message of
[1:52:02] my entire ministry you say what about
[1:52:04] all the healings all the deliverance all
[1:52:07] the mysteries what about the seals the
[1:52:09] trump is about
[1:52:09] all these things if you follow that
[1:52:13] and you don't have the token it don't do
[1:52:15] you any good
[1:52:17] the reason it's all summed up in the
[1:52:19] token is because the token is the life
[1:52:21] of jesus christ
[1:52:23] and the token is your guarantee that
[1:52:26] you're going in the rapture
[1:52:28] it is your proof of purchase that he
[1:52:30] purchased you
[1:52:31] he's accepted your faith you please him
[1:52:34] he loves you he's gonna come get you
[1:52:38] that is your proof
[1:52:42] and if you don't have the token seek him
[1:52:45] with
[1:52:45] all your heart
[1:52:49] you've got to apply the token the bible
[1:52:52] talks about a famine that's coming
[1:52:55] and is here and it's not the famine for
[1:52:58] the for the bread
[1:52:59] or water but it's a famine for the truth
[1:53:05] bible said they'll go to and fro and
[1:53:07] seek the truth and can't find it
[1:53:10] so how much more will god hold us
[1:53:12] responsible when the truth is preached
[1:53:13] here
[1:53:14] each and every service and if we don't
[1:53:16] take it and apply it to our lives
[1:53:21] because we want reality saints
[1:53:25] i i don't have a nickel's worth of time
[1:53:28] for just religion and form
[1:53:32] i want reality i want a god that lives i
[1:53:35] want a god that delivers
[1:53:36] i want a god that heals i want a god
[1:53:38] that saves i want a god that can take me
[1:53:40] out of here
[1:53:43] and you say well what about i've got
[1:53:44] i've got loved ones i've got children
[1:53:46] i've got i'm worried about them
[1:53:47] prophet i said apply the token
[1:53:51] once you have the token you can then
[1:53:53] apply the token for your parents
[1:53:56] for your family for your children for
[1:53:59] grandma for grandpa for whoever you
[1:54:01] apply the token and you commit them to
[1:54:03] god
[1:54:05] don't let their lack of servitude
[1:54:08] hinder you but you put them into god's
[1:54:11] hands you apply the token and say lord
[1:54:13] i'm claiming them
[1:54:15] i've got the token brother ram said that
[1:54:16] when we pray you've got you show the
[1:54:18] token say lord
[1:54:20] here's the token i'm praying i'm showing
[1:54:22] the token i
[1:54:23] need this and when you paid for my
[1:54:26] salvation when you sent gave me the holy
[1:54:29] ghost
[1:54:29] everything i have need of in this
[1:54:31] journey including the rapture is in
[1:54:33] the holy ghost and i'm going out for my
[1:54:37] loved one
[1:54:38] and i'm holding the token for my wayward
[1:54:39] children don't ever give up
[1:54:41] on anybody don't no matter how bad it
[1:54:44] looks
[1:54:45] and no matter how bad it seems don't
[1:54:47] ever give
[1:54:48] up on anyone because many of you might
[1:54:52] have been given up on
[1:54:53] but look look what god has done for you
[1:54:56] don't ever
[1:54:56] give up on anyone
[1:55:00] because remember during that drought
[1:55:01] when you had a widow woman which types
[1:55:03] you
[1:55:03] accepted the word of the lord through
[1:55:05] elijah the bible said even though
[1:55:07] drought and famine and starvation was
[1:55:08] going on
[1:55:09] all around them she and her son
[1:55:12] and the prophet ate many days and we
[1:55:15] have spiritual food in due season it's
[1:55:16] been stored up
[1:55:24] one more notice
[1:55:27] they were just not yet to come together
[1:55:30] to talk about the message
[1:55:33] and that's what i was meaning earlier
[1:55:35] when we come to church we don't just
[1:55:37] want to talk about the message
[1:55:39] like you may talk about you know your
[1:55:41] natural passions your
[1:55:42] i love to hunt or i love to fish or i
[1:55:44] love to go shopping you sisters or i
[1:55:46] love to decorate
[1:55:47] all that has got its place and it's fine
[1:55:50] but whenever we come to church
[1:55:51] we don't just talk about the message
[1:55:54] like we talk about the natural things
[1:55:57] we come to become we come here to become
[1:55:59] one so that whenever we leave
[1:56:02] more of this word has had an effect on
[1:56:04] our lives and maybe our hearts were
[1:56:05] pricked maybe we were healed
[1:56:07] maybe god spoke to us maybe god
[1:56:09] encouraged us maybe god delivered us
[1:56:10] maybe god gave you the holy ghost
[1:56:14] that is why we come they come together
[1:56:16] to apply the blood
[1:56:18] to apply the token
[1:56:21] that's what you must do pastor neville
[1:56:24] into this congregation
[1:56:26] trust these deacons and to your brethren
[1:56:27] it's time that we laid aside
[1:56:29] all the foolishness of the world time we
[1:56:32] laid aside everything else
[1:56:34] we've seen enough now until we are
[1:56:35] positive sure and the token
[1:56:37] must be applied without it
[1:56:42] you're going to perish you must perish
[1:56:44] that's the only thing
[1:56:45] oh don't come together say i believe it
[1:56:48] get beneath it get into it
[1:56:52] and the bible says that by one spirit
[1:56:54] we're all baptized into one body
[1:56:56] that's how you get into it
[1:56:59] that is how you get in the message when
[1:57:02] the messenger
[1:57:04] that's jesus christ gets in you
[1:57:10] because when you're in christ there's
[1:57:12] therefore now no condemnation
[1:57:14] to them that are in christ jesus
[1:57:19] and you get in christ jesus by one
[1:57:22] spirit
[1:57:24] let's stand you get into him by one
[1:57:27] spirit
[1:57:30] so remember the token
[1:57:34] is an absolute requirement
[1:57:37] we must have the life of jesus christ
[1:57:40] it's the life of jesus christ that is in
[1:57:43] us
[1:57:45] that conquers self
[1:57:49] sin and satan
[1:57:53] you you're saying for him are you saying
[1:57:55] that i've got to conquer myself that's
[1:57:57] your biggest
[1:57:58] enemy right there that is the hardest
[1:58:01] one to conquer sometimes
[1:58:02] it seems like yourself but the token
[1:58:06] life of jesus christ
[1:58:07] enables you to do that
[1:58:10] the token life of jesus christ will give
[1:58:12] you overcoming power
[1:58:15] it'll cause you to look at the right
[1:58:17] things and turn your heads from the
[1:58:19] wrong things
[1:58:21] it will cause the word live
[1:58:24] through you it will cause the very word
[1:58:28] that was been promised
[1:58:29] so if we've been promised a rapture if
[1:58:32] we've been promised a resurrection if
[1:58:33] we've been promised that body change if
[1:58:35] we've been promised healing
[1:58:36] if we've been promised this after that
[1:58:38] after that it's the holy ghost that's in
[1:58:40] us that brings the word to pass
[1:58:43] and when we surrender ourselves fully
[1:58:47] and completely and we bring we come and
[1:58:50] we
[1:58:50] come and we lay ourselves on and i'm not
[1:58:53] necessarily talking about the altar
[1:58:54] trying to make an altar call
[1:58:56] i'm talking about the altar of your
[1:58:58] heart get
[1:58:59] laying yourself out before the lord abel
[1:59:02] knew that he needed that lamb
[1:59:05] and it so pleased god that it typed
[1:59:09] jesus christ it's so pleased god when he
[1:59:12] was leading that lamb up to that altar
[1:59:14] god could see himself going up to mount
[1:59:16] calvary
[1:59:17] thousands of years later being led
[1:59:21] and being hacked to pieces they beat him
[1:59:24] till he was unrecognizable
[1:59:27] blood was going everywhere it was uh if
[1:59:29] you'll forgive the expression it was an
[1:59:31] ugly scene it was a very gruesome scene
[1:59:35] but it was one of the most beautiful
[1:59:36] pictures and it was the most beautiful
[1:59:38] picture in the entire bible
[1:59:40] it looked like the greatest defeat and
[1:59:42] it was the greatest victory
[1:59:45] amen let's put our heads in our hearts
[1:59:48] the gracious heavenly father we thank
[1:59:49] you so much lord for this opportunity
[1:59:51] lord that we can come into your presence

[2:00:20] that you can come and you can feel
[2:00:23] father may you help us more to die more
[2:00:25] to ourselves today
[2:00:26] to maybe even die right now to things
[2:00:28] that we've been holding on to

[2:00:32] maybe a petty grudge or
[2:00:34] whatever it may be lord help us to die
[2:00:36] to it right now father
[2:00:38] that when we go out them doors lord that

[2:01:27] you
[2:01:29] oh great lamb of god the lord these
