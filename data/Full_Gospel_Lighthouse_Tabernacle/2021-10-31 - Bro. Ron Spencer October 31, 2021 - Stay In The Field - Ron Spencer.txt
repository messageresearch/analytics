moments if you would please we sure appreciate your prayers we certainly love you with all of our hearts it's so good to see you wow last weekend was wonderful my brother mark and brother william just did such a phenomenal job amen i so appreciate that the lord would work it out to where we could watch it live as well and and uh we thank you for your prayers for us amen last night was awesome i mean just awesome you haven't had a chance to watch that it was awesome last night i would ask you to remember us in prayer this week we have two funerals one for sister carolyn shifflett brother jason's mother and brother shannon's mother and also tanya's mom and uh thank god there's a land beyond the river it was a couple of weeks ago i i got up on a saturday morning and the doctors have seemed to give the boys orders to kind of watch over some things and so i i got up and i got dressed early and connie said where are you going i said i'm going i'm going to visit she said you better tell them boys i said no i got a visit from a higher authority than the boys and so so i went to sister carolyn and brother garland's house and i knocked on the door and they'd had a long night and so they were later getting up and so they came to the door and i was able to sit on the bed with her we talked and she said i prayed you would come and i said i'm here amen so she talked about peace and i let her just talk for a bit and i said you know i said god takes care of our our body a long time ago and all of our mistakes and the blood of jesus christ takes care of all of that you know when the enemy comes to strike death he's very vicious at it and i said no doubt you'll you'll suffer much over the next weeks but i said in those last moments when jesus steps through the door you're gonna know special visitors are coming this room right where i'm at and they'll come and you'll know everything is all right she suffered much over that couple of weeks and extremely much even to where that fluid would come out of her eye sockets and out of her nose but in that last 15 minutes she smiled brother garland said like she had never smiled in her life we believe that special visitors walked in that room and and did a work i thank god there's a land beyond the river never let us forget that this is this is just a very temporary life but nothing can touch us once we're there and so amen i would like for you to remember the family this is a legacy family that goes back from the beginning of this church from sister cyril pendenton to to now and and she i prayed for the altar and she prayed for her children and grandchildren and god answered the prayer and if she could look across the banister of heaven now and she could see her grandchildren sitting here right near the close of the front of this and they love this message with all of their hearts you know i thank god that god answers our prayers even after we're not here generations later he watches over those prayers that have been prayed now you may lose faith sometimes and think god's forgot but god never forgets amen and so we just want to remember them amen amen and then betty flynn's funeral will be on wednesday at two o'clock i'd like for you to remember us in prayer as we go through this then at the end of the week we have a very special wedding and it's a wedding that i believe god ordained and he's watched over and he's protected for for those that uh maybe sometimes don't know the ins and outs of things and maybe even they didn't know the ins and outs of things gabriel was converted on the night that i had my brain surgery the night before i would say it was before covet it was probably 30 to 40 visitors maybe more than that that was there and all of a sudden the room emptied just me and him and i looked over at him and i said you know this room didn't empty for no reason at all i believe you need god and it didn't take but about five minutes of prayer and gabriel spencer became a brand new man and we have witnessed his growth and his miracle and he is he is marrying a princess drop right out of heaven i don't did it hurt when you hit the ground for those that don't know they're having a wedding right under a tree she had been her dream and when brother jerry and sister stephanie came through the prayer line i don't know when that was but months ago they came through the prayer line the angel of the lord spoke and said the reason they picked that place is because that's where the angel stands to watch over your family uh it's okay to shed a tear i believe this morning is going to be very special i was asked friday to be at the hospital but i i i'm a little hard-headed and and i'm not going to go into any details but they wanted me to be there this weekend but the lord had laid a message on my heart and i i knew i had to deliver the message last night when i walked into the office i had a vest on it's called a bone hiring vest and i had never put my hand in the pocket i'm going to speak on ruth and boaz this morning and so when i reached in my pocket i pulled a i pulled a an envelope out of my pocket in my vest and when i pulled it out i've got about 10 of those vests if you buy if you like it you buy you buy 10. and so when i pulled it out i i pulled it out and it said ruth and boaz well it was so spiritual to me i thought i thought william had gave it to me i was just over i was just overwhelmed by it i i i asked are you sure you didn't give me this ruth and boaz and just for confirmation i went home and made sure that it wasn't in none of the other best and so and i stood there and i knew that we were in it for a very supernatural weekend we have a little fella here that i feel led to have prayer i don't know if my strength will hold up through the evening but i i want to pray for him he's at a junction and his name is charlie and he was of a very special evening you see these parents couldn't have children and as i walked as i preached that evening i said no i said because i had a little bit of restriction in the service i said now the lord may not be able to operate out here but he can operate behind that curtain in that meeting sister sister no she just was killed in a car wreck sharnick sister charlie could suffer sugar diabetes for many many years and god healed sister charnock that night and i prayed for a few others but it just seemed like things were just not right well god heard my my words and i walked behind that big curtain on that stage and i walked by caitlyn and i walked by her and matthew and alden was there to collect me to take me to the office and take care of me and as i walked by her i turned and i felt the angel of the lord and i turned and i went back to her and i began to pray for her and there were some things said then nate we prayed with brother nate in them and i said now god will give you that child do you know that charlie was born one year later to the date if you don't think my god can't put a note in a pocket and it was in that meeting that brother dwayne jackson was called to the ministry then in that meeting also brother guido vonderbrunt was was told in that meeting that they told a lie on him told him exactly what the lie was and then told him there was a train coming for him and it was okay for him to get on and in just a couple of months the lord took him home and just just swept him just right away but charlie is a vision and he's a physical vision today amen and he needs a supernatural touch this morning and so we are going to pray for him nate native you will come with sister caitlin amen maybe brother jim and you guys will come as well amen now why are you doing this brother ron because the lord told me last night to do it so hey charlie how are you doing you look just like your daddy man will he come okay come charlie your granddaddy knowed that this was going to go on because we talked this morning amen so i'm giving you a hug for joel now charlie you were you were told by us by god that you were coming and that god that brought you here can heal your body the same as he has wesley walking he's the same god here today and he's the same god that can heal my lungs today amen heavenly father in the name of jesus christ as much as the doctors are concerned for charlie their concern for me it's because they care you put something in them to care and we thank you for that god has doctors he has nurses he has medicine and he heals through all of those things but god what was impossible i hold in my hands now we believe about a silver-tipped grizzly bear and a 42-inch caribou and squirrels came into existence lord jesus hears charlie today the angel is among his father and i ask you now as i lay my hands on him lord jesus as a representative of your kingdom i pray that you'd bring his body into total order and to all of his genetic code father would come just exactly right dear god his hormones to growth would come right and we pray in the name of jesus christ not for no man but we we're standing here for you in the name of jesus christ may you heal this baby in your name we pray right now amen amen amen

saturday night as everybody got that no service next saturday night we're going to honor these kids and so amen so god bless you god bless you for that and then on sunday morning we've got quite a number of visitors that are going to be with us and so come under expectation that god would just move in a special way now let me just share this with you the angel lord's in the building now amen he's in the building and he's for you you're it's for you now amen so you you just ask him now come by your way you just ask him to come by your way amen he's here amen let's just stand to our feet now amen amen any good to us let's just talk to him just now heavenly father we feel your awesome presence even in this building right now what more could we say or what more could we do lord as i stand here before to speak across this desk that i've spoke so many times lord jesus may today be its even greatest not because of me but because of you and i ask you father that you would be with us in a special way lord across this audience i pray that you'd sweep your wings of your presence lord to every need father lord there's not a need that's too great or too small father we ask you that you administer to families and strengthen them as they they see their loved ones slipper from this dimension to that one father pray that you comfort hearts now lord jesus is we have just prayed for little charlie and we recognize that he and wesley lord i think about that if we're ever in your mind there will never be a spot to where we'll never be there and lord these children are children of eternity and lord we recognize your presence even now lord we pray that you would anoint the speaker the needs that we would have we pray that you would touch even sister connie today bring her strength lord we just ask you that you would be with the with the goings-on of the week we asked you that you would just be in it orchestrated exactly how you would have it to be now lord jesus if we could just set a little time aside that you would speak to our hearts today lord weigh me we just fall into that channel of the presence of the lord minister to us now in jesus christ's name a man and a man and amen for those that are watching by the way of internet i just wish you could feel what we feel here today if you will turn with me to ruth chapter one and verse nine thank you for your attentiveness and and amen god bless you i'll try to be i'll try to be as brief as i can but i'll try to get the point across amen i'd like to speak to you this morning and probably next week on stay in the field stay in the field those were the instructions stay in the field ruth chapter 1 and verse 9 the lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house of your husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people and naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands turn again my daughters and go your way for i am too old to have a husband and i should say i have hope if i should have a husband also tonight and should also bear sons would you tarry for them till they are were grown would you stay for them from having having husbands name my daughters for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the lord is gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and wept again an orphan kissed her mother-in-law but ruth clave unto her brother branham said it was a type of the denomination turning and going back to their gods [Music] and she said behold my sister is gone back and under her people and under her gods return thou after thy sister-in-law and ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest i will go and whether thou largest i will lodge thy people will be my people and thy god my god were thou diest will i die and and there will i be buried the lord to do so to me and more also if ought but death part and and thee and me and when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her you may be seated this morning brother brandon says when a man loves a woman you'll hear this next week when a man loves a woman and marries her because she's pretty there'll come an end to that but when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why but he loves her and she finds a man that she loves no matter what he looks like that you're part sister's heir he loves her and she loves him that's an eternal mate in glory death nor nothing else can ever separate that because they are from eternity and when they stepped out into the space of time and return and will return back to eternity eternity has dropped down in a body and called time and then goes right back into eternity again it cannot perish that ought to make you smile right there scriptures that are very familiar to you love is patient and love is kind it does not envy it does not boast it is not proud it does not dishonor others it is not self-seeking and it's not easily angered and it keeps no record of wrongs love is passion obsession someone that you can't live without love is the thing that is always having the last word even when those words are i'm sorry forgive me or i love you no matter what love does not make the world go around love is what makes the ride worthwhile it is love that makes impossible possible [Music] quranic corinthians says do everything in love now these three things remain faith hope love but the greatest of these is love so they are no longer two but one flesh therefore what god has joined together let no one separate god hates divorce and over all these virtues put on love which binds them all together in perfect unity romans tells us oh no man anything except to love each other for one who loves another has fulfilled of the law no matter how old you get never stop holding hands never stop dancing never stop saying i love you now for those of you this morning that think that i was preparing for gabe and sarah's wedding i was actually talking about each of you because this morning i want to talk about our our relationship with christ and our marriage to him and his covenant that he makes we understand that the book of ruth is exactly placed exactly right in the scriptures to many theologians they don't understand of even why that this love story would be placed here but a prophet would come in this end time to make it clear that this was the redemption chapter and they were playing a type of redemption it would be written in matthew chapter 1 the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham abraham beguide isaac and isaac begat jacob and jacob beget judas and his brethren and judas beget feyrez and of zara of taymor and there is beget ezram and ezram beget amram and amram beget abinadab and abinadab begat nasan and nasin begat salmone and salmon begat boaz of rahab and boaz bega oh bad oh obed of ruth and obet beget jesse and we know jesse beget david notice it was not the famous ladies of the scriptures that are mentioned in the generation of jesus christ but it was ladies with the history it was women that had a past it was women that would actually because of their their past in their lives maybe be condemned unto death outside of redemption but because god predestinated a womb through which the seed would come forward i want you to understand every one of us tonight this morning we are the predestinated creatures of god not necessarily just of time but of eternity and god has a plan in every one of our lives and maybe we don't understand the plan maybe we actually argue with the plan maybe we would actually in our own human in our own human nature would actually would actually would have rather went a different way but god that is rich in mercy overrode your free moral agency because by the law of election the law of election he chose you when you couldn't choose yourself he elected you by predestination he elected you when you were running another way no you wasn't seeking for god god came looking for you you were in trouble you were in a mess but got rich in mercy our old book was written and it had a lot of a lot of stuff in it but god had a land for us god had a purpose god had a feel for us as well understand today that ruth no doubt could see in ruth chapter 1 that there would ever be a book written about her she had married a man in a family of of believers from another nation and we can question why that they were even there because famine had drove them from the land famine had cost them they went and found jobs and they had moved they wouldn't understand their purpose there god will make our permissive we'll work out to his perfect will and so they didn't have to leave they didn't have to leave the land of promise because many people stayed behind and god fortified them through through the the famine and he watched over them through the famine but here this family moves and they they're there and they become craftsmen and their their two sons raise up and while they're there and they marry they marry doc they marry women of that nationality they marry women that worship other gods they marry women that seem to to be a part of that nation but in god's great plan he has these two girls to marry these two boys they will take on a role that we can look at now in this sea laodicean age and we can look at now that they played their role and they did exactly what the seed on the inside of them said that they would do when they're when the husband died and their their husbands died the only thing left for naomi a type of the orthodox church to go back home that that's the only thing that she now owned is just to go back home there was a house there there was a parcel there there was property there and there was kinsmen that was there that could take care of her and she tells her daughter-in-laws and he's quoted in many marriage ceremonies she tells her daughter-in-law's go back home go back home to be with your families go back there go stay with your families you i i i'm old i i'll never be able to raise up i'll never be able to raise up children to which under the law that you could marry those those boys i i could never i could never do that i you know i'm getting older i'm not in that season of my life and she just she begins to kind of urge them to to go back orpha speaks up and she turns and she kisses her goodbye and she listens to her words and she she goes back she goes back and even the scripture says she goes back to her gods now i want you just to notice when a person turns back they're never mentioned again in the outlay of the scriptures their choice took them out of the plan of god [Music] now god don't force you to love him he don't force you to love him but there's something on the inside of you [Music] god don't make you do anything and he plays something on the inside of you and she goes back how many places in the scriptures could we bear out this morning a people that chose their own way and they turned for different reasons in life and kiss the message goodbye and whether they realize it or not in the great eternity they'll never be remembered orpha has no plan in the scriptures i don't mean to be difficult but i've got to just lay some things out here but ruth was of a different calling and she begins to immediately respond i'm going with you i'm going with you i don't know what the future holds but i'm going with you where do you go i'm going where are you where you lie down i'm going to lie down where you sleep i'm going to sleep your people's going to be my people your god's going to be my god where you die i'm going to die listen we made a commitment a long time ago god's god and we're going to stay here with him regardless of the outcome we're going to stay with him now quickly you might say well preacher you're standing there with cancer ravaging your body let me just say this to you god told me if i would trust him he would use me like never before and god's made promises throughout this scriptures that's greater than cancer god's greater than blood clots god's greater than the issues that i fight in my life hebrews chapter 11 says it like this by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a certain place which should have to receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went not knowing whether he went it's a faith walk yes sir i want to just i want to just drop this to you this is not hollywood there's going to be ups and downs in your life there's going to be discouragement there's going to be moments of pain there's going to be distress but he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you this is generational promises we saw the miracle this morning of of wesley wesley's miracle is generational he could have been bound in a wheelchair the rest of his life he would have been just as loved but you see god's got a plan [Applause] he's a healer he made a way for that he made a way for charlie he made a way for you [Applause] and let me just say this to you his promises are everlasting you hold to your prom those promises it's personal you'll have a lot of cheerleaders around you coaching you and every day i get i get new medical advice from people all over the all over the world from africa to to all over america people sending me the newest trick and the newest fashion and the newest thing to battle cancer this works this right here works doctors are at a spot right now with me that there's no greater chemo that they can they can use on me there they don't have any more it's up to god and i'd say that's a good spot to come to it's up to god now the scripture says this that by faith he's so adjourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs of the same promise for he looked for a city whose builder and maker which had foundation whose builder and maker is god i know you know this but i want to just lay some things down that land had boundaries to it that land had promised to it it was in the hands of other people but god had given them the land and the reason abraham could be so strong in faith he had met the king of the city let me just say that king didn't come to all the other kings that king didn't come to hundreds and thousands of people he sat with that king melchizedek and looked at him eye to eye and only in this day did the messenger of the hour after the seals were revealed told us who that king was that was god in a theophany body that came to visit abraham and this king could turn abraham and sarah back to young people again where's all the theologians that had missed that laying in the scriptures but for the bride of jesus christ because you have the same promise that same king is among us today [Applause] and the promise is he's going to turn your bodies young again [Applause] and if we go by the way of the grave by faith we've got a promise that he'll raise us back up [Applause] not in a sick body but a body totally will that land would have boundaries it would go to a certain river it would go to a certain mountain it would go to a certain place let me just drop here just for a moment we're the nation to which hosted the prophet of this age we have boundaries as a nation we're supposed to protect those boundaries we're supposed to but today i'm not going to talk about the mexico border or the north border or the oceans we were born as a nation screaming give me liberty or give me death we put it in our halls of our congresses that we trust in god the god i hope this gets to our governors we made a a promise that this will be a godly nation we laid out the boundaries that just as israel as netanyahu stood before his council and they they were saying that you don't have a title deed to the land of israel and he raised up the bible and he said this is my title deed [Applause] god gave me this land i want to raise the same bible today and say god gave us this land and every promise in this bible belongs to us and just as israel has had to fight for its boundaries now they have to fight for the boundaries they have to fight for what god has given us let me just say you have to fight let me just say this publicly weak pulpits are guilty of taking this bible and it's no longer welcome in the halls of congress the ten commandments is not welcomed in our judicial system i have a phone message came to us yesterday the day before yesterday of of a pastor that you know as a boy robert marrario he came here and preached for us he preached for my father and he's screaming for help from preachers and people around the world to pray for them as a body of believers several body believers in new york and he begins to scream and he begins to lay out his burden i'm not going to play it to you this morning but that's not my my point but we want to pray for him he says because of the democratic governor that they are now taking 40 percent of the police force away this weekend they're gone and he says our streets are now wicked he said our northern cities are now becoming so polluted and he wants us to pray where do we move where do we go i want to tell him where to go into this promised land because what's going on in new york is coming to grottos and elkton the covet that we talked about that was in china came to us the sin that was in sodom in san francisco came to virginia we can put our head in the sand and say well we're going to be here for hundreds of more years i got news for you nations are breaking israel is awakening the signs of the prophets were told look up your redemption is near i was asked last year to become involved in the government you don't know this but i was asked last year to become involved in as an advisor to one of our senators and become one of his personal advisors and i just wrote him back and said i'm sorry i've got a bigger job than that so i'm going to give a little advice this morning i'm going to give a little advice this morning when you sell your borders out expect the enemy to come in amen brother branham stood and preached a sermon called warning then judgment and the reason america is in the place that she is today is because she had an opportunity just like other generations had an opportunity at receiving the message whether it was wesley whether it was martin luther or whether it was william branham but they turned down the message and when you turn down the warning from god i'm going to need something more concrete brother ron noah stood and preached 120 years god is a very patient god don't you blame god don't you blame god for the condition america is in god gave her a warning she would never have needed a hospital gonna preach to you she'd have never needed the manufacturing facility even to take care of the clothes you wouldn't have needed a police department [Applause] i need proof brother ron i'll give it to you moses went through the wilderness 40 years and god provided water for him in a desert he provided food for them for 40 years they never hunted they never fished god provided the soles of their shoes never wore out the threads of their clothes never wore out [Applause] they never built a hospital in the whole time that's our god [Applause] brother brahma said i want to post the church on where you're at so i'm going to post you on where you're at this week not five years ago not 30 years ago in the last seven days since william spoke our president were you lacking you don't lack him he's still your president shook hands with the pope and the pope reestablished that he could have communion it made a lot of priests even across america upset but listen there's a greater force at work [Music] and this pope made statements this week that he will be the first pope to exercise political power on the footprint of climate change i want to tell you the climate is changing and i'm not talking about hot and coal they are establishing even this week that there will come world taxes to which that he will oversee brother branham predicted and i know people made fun of it but brother brown predicted that we would get a woman rise in america the president could be rome could be a vice president should stand in purple well that took place you don't have to argue about that that took place make fun of you you want to it's kind of like making fun of an arc you know these people that get on the internet and make all kind of fun of the message it's those kind of people that were that were standing outside of the ark making fun but you know when they became believers when the water [Applause] brother ron pray for my loved ones that did that oh no i took my hands off of them according to the scriptures a long time ago they'll be believers when me and you are not not here anymore when i ain't able to you won't be making fun of me or andrew or these other ministers that are still proclaiming the banner of the message of the hour you can call us god sometimes a handshake is more than a handshake billy graham made that handshake many years ago our prophet refused that handshake brother branham was standing on one side of the door and the pope was on the other and brother branham was given instructions that you'll have to bow and kiss his ring and he said i'll not call no man father except for my lord jesus christ and i'll not worship another man and i'll knock kiss another's ring and he turned away from that i want to remind you that we're not a christian nation anymore in our supreme court we have all but one is catholic so we are a catholic nation we have a president that's catholic and he's an active catholic don't you republicans get too too relaxed because your fox news announcers are over 90 catholic and pay homage to that you see regardless of the pulpits of today because of the weaknesses of the pulpits they have forgot to proclaim that she's still the mother of harlots and the daughters that are the denominational system that are tied to her through the umbilical cord of father son holy ghost baptism or her daughters you see i'm speaking on boundaries here for a little while i'll not get too hard to ruth and boaz but i'm speaking on boundaries because they're important america forgot our boundaries and we can stand and scream about american we love her and we love her and i'm thankful for america today i stand with her in her glory and i stand with her in her nonsense she's still she's still amongst the greatest but she's turned down the message she forgot her boundaries [Music] she forgot her boundaries i i understand people wanting to come to america because it's a better land i understand you want to stay here because it's a good land america if you still up to right now you can work and provide for yourself it won't be that way much longer but you can still provide for yourself it's going to change shortly we're becoming a socialist nation because it has to be that way for the tribulation period you see scripture's got to be fulfilled and it's got to be that way don't send me new emails and don't send me new text if you're mad at me because i could care less what i'm not concerned about is i'm not concerned i truly am concerned about america's borders i am concerned that she's went the way that she has but i'm really concerned about people i'm concerned about the borders at your land i'm caught i'm concerned about the borders of your family now i want you to be attentive with me i'm concerned about what we let in our homes what we entertain ourselves with the communication and and the things that take place i'm concerned about prayer lives i'm concerned about how much we read our bible and draw from the source i'm concerned about how much we listen to the message of the hour or have we let brother branham become a stranger to our home i'm concerned about have we allowed the message to become entertainment but have we let too many enemy infiltrate the land and contaminate our wells i want to say one words to you re-secure your border re-secure your border they ought to see us here they ought to see us to the point to where god throwed up on it do you want another term puked on this age it became an age to where that is so sodom he's not welcome here no more i've said this before in that be an appropriate spot if you don't think that america has turned away from the message then invite brother branham [Music] brother ryan's not going to come back and have a ministry contrary to a lot of people's thoughts but invite the the best of the best of the message to go speak in your huge cathedrals they won't allow that to happen but you can sing songs of worship and move massive congregations with with this new age worship and people love to worship but allow one of these ministers to stand in the pulpit and preach straight come on brother just preach straight he won't be there long why brother ron are you preaching like this because the borders have been infiltrated brother branham preached another sermon and i want to drop right here the invasion of the united states brother brown said they could take this nation without firing a shot and they have proved that they did it israel always got in trouble when it left its homeland that's where your promises are that's where we will get in trouble when we leave the promises of the bible the borders of the bible let me just say this to you even with the message of the hour you may not understand it but don't you throw rocks at it i want you to understand as i go into this just for a moment and i won't get done because i'm just about finished with this part the only land of redemption for ruth was in boaz's field there was a lot of fields there was a lot of men of great wealth she actually even had a nearer kinsmen to her but naomi's instructions was to go to boaz's field let me just read a part of a quote and i may read it all to you next time the great heart at rahab become a believer i look at her history here not long ago and she was considered brought into the faith because of her belief in god she was brought into the israeli israelite a faith alight she courted a general in the army an israelite army watch what god did for that woman they moved to bethlehem and they had a son and his and that son was they called him boaz and out of boaz he married ruth can i drop this to you now god's been working on you for generations way before you ever arrived he prepared for you he prepared for you yes sir rahab entertained two strangers and her job because of circumstances of life was to be a harlot and she entertained a lot of men but these days she entertained the message of the hour and he got a covenant with him she said your god is god she had a lot of gods that she could serve but your god is the only true god i have protected you i want you to protect me let down a scarlet rope on the wall the most protected city that was the gateway to the promised land i want you to think about the children of of abraham as they move across this land and begin to take their land the first city is jericho the most fortified city that there was everybody would perish but one family brother ron the way you preach it is let me just say this dude don't find these sermons difficult find grace in this [Music] don't find this difficult god bypassed a million and chose you what about my brother what about my sister what about my mother it's up to god but don't you for a second overlook the grace of god for your opportunity [Applause] it's a it's a strange way to fight a war to march around a city without saying a word and you do it for days you do it for days but on that last day when you march you scream we're gonna sound trumpets and it wasn't the vibration of the sound of their voices it was god was confirming a promise and those walls that chariot races could be run on one of the greatest armies that there ever been was behind those walls they begin to crumble let me just say satan's kingdom is crumbling it's falling down it's coming to its end at the sound of this void let it crumble [Applause] let it crumble in your life let it strongholds crumble in your life and walk a brand new day stay in the field stay in the field let's stand to our feet this morning god bless you god bless you god bless you hallelujah amen i love you i want to say this to you each and every one of you you're worth fighting for you're worth fighting for thank god for a prophet that would stand in pulpits all across america all through canada mexico around the world and he would stand there and he would come with his little bible maybe 26 pages of notes and he walked to the pulpit good evening friends good evening and just the presence of that angel would cause conviction to go all across that audience people would get healed miracles would happen people's lives would be changed but after you get away from the influence of the light you go right back to what you were you got to stay in the field you gotta stay in the field how quickly can you you leave the field and before long you start dressing like the world and acting like the world and have the habits of the world and actually get worse than what you were before it's like i told a young man that he told me he said i'll never be like other people i said let me just give you just a bit of instruction because you may not know this the the the scripture says that once you leave the first enemy comes back to see if you're full of the holy ghost and that first enemy opens up the door and then he holds the door open for seven more much worse than himself that's why you see people walk away the first enemy you may be able to control but it's the seven more and then it gets worse from one generation to another generation to another generation there's protection in this field we'll get to it next week there's protection in this field you stay in this field i'll make sure you got plenty to eat i'll put i'll put i'll put i'll put barley down on purpose for you i'll make sure that none of the other men touch you i'll make sure that nobody else will come near you [Applause] i'll put boundaries around you i got a plan for you but you gotta stay in the field [Applause] hallelujah
