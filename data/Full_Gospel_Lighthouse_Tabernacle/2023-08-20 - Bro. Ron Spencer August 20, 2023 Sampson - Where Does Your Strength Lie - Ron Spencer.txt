reminders we're preparing for our Labor Day so just remember that we are expecting crowds so don't expect your seat to be saved before or after church so if you want to get a certain seat you got to get here early because we're going to pack them in and just because it's one seat that doesn't mean anything during the labor day we're going to pack them in as much as we can hold your hands up scoot in sit down we're going to keep doing that until we get them all in here amen so I think we did a comparison last year it's not just 12 or 14 seats I think we can get more people and I ain't going to say it like I think it but you can get more on one seat than what you think amen so uh so we're gonna pack her in here and just take all your stuff with you your toys Bibles fans all that stuff needs to go with you every service that week because when you come in the next meeting it might not be there amen so just be mindful of that and then on the work day tomorrow as well we're going to be

you return with me to Judges chapter 16 this afternoon Judges chapter 16. amen Hallelujah Hallelujah I want to speak today on Samson where does your strength lay Samson where does your strength lay amen amen Judges chapter 16 and verse 15. and when she said unto him how count us thou say I've Loved thee went on heart is not with me thou Hast mocked me these three times and has not told me we're in thy great strength lieth and it came to pass that when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death that he told her all his heart and said unto her there hath not come a razor upon mine head for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb if I'd be shaven then my strength will go from me and I shall become weak and be like any other man and when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the Lords of the Philistines saying come up this once for he has showed me all his heart then the Lords of the Philistines came up unto her and brought money in their hand and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off Seven Locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him and she said the Philistines be upon thee Samson and he'll walk out of his sleep and said I will go out as other times I think this is a phenomenal statement I will go out as other times before and shake myself this is this is incredible words and whis not that the Lord was Departed from him amen let's pray Lord Jesus we love you today thankful to be in your house one more time you give us an opportunity that we never want to take for granted one day we'll walk through these doors for the last time maybe not even realizing it's our last time but I pray that you'd speak to our hearts today Lord our desire when we come here is to draw closer to you Lord if there would be anything in us that would not be right we asked you that we apply it to the blood of Jesus Christ ask you to forgive us wash our spirit wash our flesh Lord wash us today and we shall be clean Lord anoint us in a special way we pray an anoint us a speaker but not just speaker but enormous as the hearer today we pray in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen you can be seated verse 23 . let's just go back to 21. the Philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with Fetters of brass and he did grind in the prison house how bit the hair of his head began to grow again and he was shaven then the Lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagen their God and to Rejoice for they said our God hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand and when the people saw that praised their God and for they said our God hath delivered us delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which he slew many of us and it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they said call for Samson that he may make a sport and that called for Samson out of the prison house and he made them Sports Sport and he said him between the pillars quite an incredible scene brother Brandon would say it like this he said let's just think I can see the Warriors some of them old veterans with scars on their faces huh as they looked at Samson and standing there hopeless helpless they remembered of seeing him stand one time with a Jawbone in his hand and and a thousand Philistines think about this and a thousand Philistines laying there dead at his feet and now a little boy is leading him around by the hand they could remember how he questioned the council with the news and was brought that a man a mere man this was a mere man they thought took a Jawbone of a mule and many of us you have taken the history of the Philistines those armor that they wore the helmet of their head was almost an inch thick with brass and their coat was that they wore they were they were great Mighty Men with great laps a half inch of brass up and down their body to cover it with and a long spear coming a hard strike a two-edged sword that would knock them off of their feet now how could a man just one man with a thousand around him armored and dressed with armor with the spears those big helmets that only though I have showed through How could a man take a Jawbone of a mule and beat down them all of them at one time while the first lick with that old battle that old brittle Jawbone would fly to thousands of pieces hitting those helmets they know that something was in the Supernatural Realm when he struck that Warrior on the head and the thing dented in and killed him instantly right hand left hand he struck and every time he struck the power of God struck with it it doesn't it doesn't take when you when you think about it what a great thing it only takes a a hand that's completely Anointed with the Holy Ghost with God God's power to strike down any enemy under in any circumstance and how those Warriors remembered could it be possible that we've got the wrong man some of them might have said no that's him I can just see a stature that's Samson he's the one that served what he said was a true God but his God has forsaken him um Samson would pray this prayer Samson prayed right when he said it Lord let me die with these Philistines he failed but he said let me die he said you must be ready to die to your enemy that's got this victory over you you must be willing to surrender to your own ideas so Samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of God back in his life again think of that statement now they was wrong when they said that God had forgot forsaken him God had not forsaken him he had forsaken God and I think about that's the way it is with people today it isn't God that's forsaken the church it isn't God that's forsaken the church it is the first it is the church that has forsaken God and his word and that's exactly what's the matter now notice this statement he says now Samson knew in his backslidden condition he know that he couldn't have the strength to meet the challenge of the hour though he was there all of the Machinery was there the same muscles that could take the Jawbone in and beat down a a thousand Philistines the same muscles hung on the same man the same shoulders that could take the gates of Gaza up on the top of the mountain was still the same muscles hanging on him or I could say it somewhere you could see it but he know it's a difference now that he note that he couldn't meet the challenge of the hour so does the church know in its immoral condition we'll never meet the challenge of the hour what a state America is in what a state the modern church is in look at the moral condition of the day and were we hard I think it's almost unfathomable of where we have come in just a few years in a few Decades of where we stand at today no moral compass whatsoever I promise almost every day I'm going to I'm going to boycott the news and some days I do boycott the news it just seems overwhelming it seems just overwhelming to me overwhelming to me of what is going on around us but it gives us even greater responsibility he gives us a greater responsibility that our light must shine in this dark place because remember a candle isn't much strength in the daylight you really don't even need the light but let me just say when it becomes not when it becomes night that candle begins to illuminate the place where you're at we have a we have a marriage that's at our place that's getting the trash of her dumpster and making a mess and you know so when my dog barks my dog stands about that tall and he's a Bernie doodle and and he's he's quite mischievous and yet he'll lay on our laps and you know you know scream for a hug and scream for a belly rubbing yet when you're gone he'll he'll be mischievous and eat things he shouldn't eat and tear up things that he shouldn't tear up and he'll get in the mail he'll get into in the boxes that come from Amazon and you feel like doing a lot of things to him and he just is a real he's a real terror on our screened-in porch at night when that bear walks by you would think that he could go out there and eat him up who opened that gate but I got a I got a little flashlight and it's not but about that long a brother from Ohio gave it to me and it can illuminate the night it can shine I I don't know exactly how far it can shine but it can shine maybe three or four hundred yards and illuminate it you know as dark as that that bear is I can see it I can see it it's red eyes begin to shine and you know I can walk right up to that Rascal and you know he's not scared of me he said had enough weight that he's not scared of me and he can just stand there and raise up on his back feet he lights my trash he likes digging through it I don't like it that he's digging through it now I I told you that story for a reason in the Old Testament men didn't have the Holy Ghost they just would go and offer sacrifice one time a year and and they that the life of that lamb or the life of that turtle dove could not come back on them but yet God in his Redemption story would take these individuals and raise them up to defeat the enemy God purposed that Samson would be a man that would defeat the Philistines even before his birth he had a reason for Samson to be born he had a reason to have a Nazarite vow on him and Samson was not going to be a natural man in that human flesh as long as he kept the Nazarite vow God would anoint him with a super power that no other man had been Anointed with even till this day but Samson began to Scallywag around and Samson had the idea that it would always be this way he could he could be the representative of Israel but he could also court now think about it all the girls in the promised land he went court and in another spot there's work got him in trouble when you start worshiping false gods it'll get you in trouble are you with me now brother Ben wouldn't make this statement invisible Union of the Bride 65. he said it's a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern Church want any of these screaming shouting tongue-speaking Acts 2 38 youngins around her she don't want them looping and crying and screaming while such a child would immediately be put out their denomination if they had one of them in their churches they'd throw it out real quick why are you letting such things as that go on so you see she's pregnant with something talking about the church pregnated with something because she's bringing forth members all the time she don't want them screaming hollering blabbering Acts 2 38 miserable creatures that she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her her educated ethical scientific society that she belonged to here and they would throw her out real quick at the next Council she can't have it she don't want to be pregnated with the word because that's the only that the word can bring forth born of the spirit of God it has the spirit of God in it no intellectual Church joining Creed going black carrot painted face there's no such a thing as that that in it at all you can't find that in the word of God you find old-fashioned Sanctified Holy Ghost Field child born of the spirit of God I love this screaming and hollering and shouting praising God now that's all together out of the reaches of her she don't want it no sir no indeed what what does she do then she brings forth I'm just going to say it how he said it she brings forth a pair of a painted face shorts wearing Jezebel Society illegitimate clats they call them I I think it they call it cats look at the cat going there look at that that's something like that she was born and married and connected with her first husband Adam by an adulterous wife of Eve Adam's first wife you say adulterous she sure was she claims that as Adam this first Adam is dead and he died a long time ago and I'm Reborn he said and and I'm certainly married to a second Adam and that's called Christ comes down just a little further and he says now watch her lover you want to see who she's in love with the word says this but she says my church says this then who's she in love with then who is her husband her own fruits prove what she is shows what she is she was born first to Adam and that was her natural nature and she never left that that's a lover of the war of the world she claims that she's born the second time to Christ but her lover notice Adam because she loves the world easy statement you can't love God and love the world that's the same time so churches begin to pattern themselves after Hollywood because it's needed is your way are you with me now we live in this world but we're not of this world Revelation Chapter 2 nevertheless I have some what against thee because thou has left thy first love to understand this you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original Saints of Ephesus alone this message is through the entire age it's the message it's it's to all generations Now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of Israel we see Revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next and in the third generation Embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth generation there is no visit there's no vistage of whatsoever of the original Flame then God lights the fire again and the same processors are repeated it is simply the manifestation of truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by the natural birth any more than there is truth to the apostolic succession it isn't the word you start out with True born-again Believers and the Next Generation comes along and there are no longer than just plain Christians but they have a denominational name they're Baptist they're methodists and that is exactly what they do they're not Christians you have to be born again by the will of God not by the will of man to be saved and these folks are coming along together not by the now by the will of man and I don't say that of them that they aren't right with God not for a minute do thy say that but the original fire has died down one of the greatest preachers that ever lived was a man named Spurgeon and Spurgeon many of you read him because you read him by your by your daily readings that you you read that but listen Spurgeon had an incredible Revival that was among them had schools of preachers had men that came in and he was the one that said that every sermon should be written down and he would write down his sermons by the hundreds of thousands and they begin to develop those sermons on Tuesday and by Sunday they would have about a hundred thousand copies of it but he is the one that said one day they will be able to capture a man's voice they'll be able to capture a man's voice while he's preaching where are we at today but if you look back where spurgeon's at the schools don't even want nothing to do with him they've taken these names off their schools and they don't want to have a part of what Spurgeon did I would say John Wesley would be very disappointed with the Methodist today I'd say Smith would be very disappointed with the Baptist today but I would say if William Branham walked into this church today he'd be very pleased to be able to preach to bride believe in people that love the message the way that you do we're not a denomination we have not denominated this thing we do not have headquarters in Jeffersonville [Applause] are you with me now our headquarters is in the Holy Ghost and we want the same spirit of God that was on Acts 2 to be moving through this audience back and forth we want the same lives live today that lived inside of Jesus Christ we do not want a church of drama where there's bickering and fussing and going backwards forth that happens with carnal believers that are constantly having to be propped up with a crutch but if you get the Holy Ghost that will be your satisfying portion that will be your satisfying portion are you with me now you see the reason that I'm speaking this today is I spoke at Ohio at St Mary's camp many of you were there 20 years ago when I spoke there and I spoke I actually took this thought and I spoke on the moderate Church that does not want any of these acts 2 38 tongue speaking whooping crying youngness and he said I begin to reiterate that the modern Church wants a polished up group I do not want to polish the message to where it's acceptable amongst the everyday Society [Applause] it is a message to call out a bride out of the world out of denominationalism are you with me to keep you from having to go through the tribulation period you didn't know it but I was fighting behind the scenes and struggling with spirits that even at that time did not want altar calls or did not want prayer lines well it didn't offend me none whatsoever I just want only had an altar call and about 400 people came to the altar you can't stop a Holy Ghost Field man of God I refuse for men to try to formalize this message I will knock cower down to it [Applause] just uh last week God moved at the end of the service after I had preached and it took about five minutes on Samson and that's why we're speaking today on it and as God began to move a call to the altar came and I would estimate hundreds of people came to the altar received the Holy Ghost they wrapped around they wrapped around all over the stage wrapped around I'd never seen quite anything quite like it how many of you was there I know you was how many of you was there in that meeting what an incredible move of God that was there receiving the Holy Ghost receiving life change are you with me because I still believe in it I may be 62 years old next week but I'm not retiring I'm not I'm not going to sit down on the couch somewhere or another I am going to keep preaching to you the passion that has been inside of me all of these years okay are you with me now thank you for that I would say today that people who are ashamed of the move of God and to worship have chose to polish their rocks polish the message and they're wanting a better class a class of of worship with formal patterns well let me just let me just preach to you before long if you you push the gifts out of the church and you push real worship out of the church you're going to have to introduce programs and before long you're introducing programs that you have to you have to you have to begin to introduce programs to keep people clean because the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost you can't get people sealed and until you get people sealed with the Holy Ghost it'll keep pornography out of your life it'll keep music out of your life that's not right you don't have to preach dress code when you're talking about Holy Ghost Field people it'll cause conviction your homes will be homes of love and not fighting and stewing and are you with me now but when you divorce yourself from worship now now let me just say this to you brother Branham came to our area for a reason it was the Pentecostal people that invited him here through the Full Gospel businessmen because the background of our area was people that that worshiped at little missions and they worshiped in places and they were not ashamed to worship God to the point to when people tried to hush it up or even to try to put it out that they would shoot through windows and while the women were dancing bullets would fall off of their dresses you say well brother Ron that was in the flesh bullets falling off your dresses in the flesh men sticking their head in hot stoves now let me just say this to you we're not expecting you to do that and neither are we expecting bullets to be falling off of your dresses but it's the same God it is the same God Among Us and brother Branham was not ashamed of it all those years ago and neither would he be ashamed of it today brother on but that's Wildfire okay sure I'm sure that people get in the flesh and get a little wild brother Brown called himself a wild preacher [Music] I'm just getting started I'm just getting started one day I preached a sermon on the autopsy of a dead Church brother Homer loved it he absolutely loved it because men in their denominational systems once the fire had started classy people began to come into the church and they begin to come in bankers and all different kind of people begin to come in and there's Bankers here don't be ashamed of me but people wanted it to become more classy laughs they didn't want to have to go through Hog Pen experiences they didn't want to come to the Altar and die out crying and screaming that their old flesh would die and they could have a new man they didn't want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they replaced the move of God with boards and they replaced it with programs they made decisions to quieten the atmosphere of their Church gifts were not no longer welcomed and just a few statements from the pulpit would begin to chill the atmosphere of God moving people became afraid of the holy ghost moving but it becomes an atmosphere to where the church begins to die it becomes an atmosphere to where you get a religious a religious atmosphere and sin becomes comfortable in the church May sin never become comfortable in this church [Applause] programs today today they if they want a large crowd they'll bring singing groups in they'll bring some tech talk preacher in that can blow your minds with his Greek or blow your minds with some some talk some kind of psychology that won't deliver people folks I'm sorry I I just have to be the one I'm the messenger today I've been the messenger since I was a boy 40 years I preached this same thing I haven't changed whatsoever [Applause] but when you begin to go toward the world you'll do like Samson did if Samson would have stayed in his place if he would have stayed in his place he would have carried out the mind of God he would have did his job but he began to flirt with the world now let me just say this to you Samson must have seemed like some incredible Champion even to his own folks I was looking for the word today uh of these superheroes what's those I don't mean to compare it this way but what's those movies that that have these great Heroes what's that term Marvel Marvel is Emma right there Marvel hero they must have thought when they got word that Hermione championed Samson took a Jawbone of an ass and killed a thousand men maybe when Gaza when the Great Gates maybe 12 tons those great Gates when he became anointed he picked them up and carried him up on a hill not just picked them up but he carried him up on a hill can you imagine trying to take those Gates back down and put them in their place the legend that began to be around him now let me just say this to you no doubt many of the population didn't realize that there was something underneath when his courts were broken all of the things took place but there was an underlying sin that was destroying this great man's life it's the underlying sin that is destroyed way too many churches and as I said and studied this this week and I thought about I thought about people great people that seem to be on the right track for so long I'm going to preach they seem to be on the right track for so for soul preachers seem to be so right and we saw so phenomenal it's phenomenal Miracles amongst them but after a while they laid their head in the Lila's lap the first time that I ever saw brother Donnie Reagan preach he was a new kid on the Block and he's preaching at a large at a large convention God lays a sermon on his heart you say brother on this is difficult to what you're preaching today my job's not too difficult today Donnie Reagan's job was difficult that day and he's preaching a sermon on Samson you've laid your head in the Lawless lap too long and he turns around to a phenomenal well-known preacher and points his finger in the eyes and says you're the man that's laid your head in Delilah's lap too long to the people he looked like an incredible hero but behind the scenes he was having affair one sermon destroyed his kingdom one of brother Homer's favorite statements your sins your sins we'll find you out you can't sin or maybe for a while you get by with it but you're really not getting by with it you're really not getting by with it let me just say this you I would rather ask God and be right straight up front with God I'd rather ask him God forgive me don't let me be a stumbling block to anybody else yes are you with me now I don't want to be a stumbling back to another person right where's y'all brother you're doing fine someone said I was hiding behind cancer and it was propping up my Ministry how'd you like to go before God with that on your chest I've been fighting it for three and a half years I don't want my worst enemy to do that so you might want to put that stone back in your pocket and ask God to forgive you brother Ron what do you think about that idiots are born every day stupid people opened their mouth and you don't know that they're stupid until they open their mouth and I'm being real nice I'm being real nice I'm being real nice here the next time I'm gonna call their name [Applause] I just chose three and a half years ago to fight cancer listen I don't regret my choice whatsoever I could have died in four months but I chose to fight it and with God on my side I listen I could live a long time and while I'm living I'm going to torment the kingdom of hell I'm gonna preach it I'm gonna pull the sword I'm going to pull the sword I'm going to fight now what I would suggest to that person with your well body you go do something with your well body you go do something if I can do this with chemo going in my body every day and I can stand here dizzy as I am this morning with your well body quit throwing rocks at me and throw them at the Devil [Applause] brother random warned the Branham Tabernacle and he set Samson the Philistines is on thee his own church worldlyism is creeping in among you what about it have you exposed your secret have you exposed that secret that God give you when you were wallowing there and the sawdust a few years ago have you let it creep out into social formal worship what happened to you God can come down and perform a miracle and go right down through the audience tell people the secrets of their heart and everything heal the sick and The Afflicted and do signs and wonders and preach his word as hard as they can by the Holy Ghost and people say what's the attitude well I guess that's all right we enjoy listening to it once in a while if we're not too tired and brother Branham says that's random Tabernacle and he says the Philistines are on thee when used to be the preaching of the word and All Saints With Tears in their eyes would rise to their feet and walk sobbing maybe not say in a word just walking around two or three times and sat down so filled with the Holy Ghost the word fed them man shall not live by ever bread alone but by every word that perceiveth out of the mouth of God the Philistines are on thee Branham Tabernacle he says this did you ever go into a church where the pastor is real starchy the congregation is the same way that's right it's an atmosphere that's brought it he said go into a place where the pastor says now wait a minute there's no such a thing as a as that nonsense I don't I don't believe in such a thing as Divine Healing the baptism of Holy Ghost you know you'll see every one of them in congregation but he says if there's an eagle in there somewhere he'll get out so if you're in a dead Church move [Music] brother Ron but that's difficult how many of you moved from four hours away could you stand real quick was it worth it you just moved this week was it worth it give them a good hand brother Jordan and sister Kirsten I'd like for them to stand they came from one of the greatest Cults that you can be in it was a cult they moved here with the clothes on their back I baptized them won't you guys stand to I baptized them old order clothes baptized them in order to close as a matter of fact when they first moved here they had nothing I'm not putting them in a bad spot but they were willing to give it all up they were willing to give all of that up to come here with nothing a couple of years ago you can be seated a couple years ago you know when I saw brother Jordan when he first came here he had difficulty clapping his hands and I watched him and he's one of the most athletic people that I I've ever seen just play a sport with him that guy is an athlete but because he came out of a dead Church listen we had a convention here I'd never seen nothing like it he came running around here and he didn't dodge this thing right here he did a flip I told brother Donnie Reagan I said I never taught him to do that because I can't do it [Applause] but I said can you imagine he came from a church we were just at a place the other day with a thousand people and I could hear my best day manner with a thousand people [Applause] Hallelujah we are not ashamed I say it we are not ashamed and I want to say this to you I refuse to let them take a razor and cut our worship off I refuse I refuse I refuse I am not ashamed to worship God brother on when we get there we're going to worship what about now what about now what about now thank God we've overcome sin thank God we've overcome dead religion thank God that we're overcoming cancer one day at a time thank God [Applause] go ahead praise the Lord go ahead hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] I don't want an easy beliefism I don't want somebody to come in and preach way over top of my head that you can't understand how about something that will move on the inside of my heart [Music] we're moving the tapes out but that's not the sign that we don't want you to listen to tapes many of those tapes we helped put in this building 40 years ago but now you can have a card now you can have a now you can have a little computer now it's on your phone it's on your phone six-year-olds has got phones anymore I don't agree with you about six year olds it's got phones anymore and you can listen to the prophet of God on your phone in your car in your library you can listen to it anywhere any place at any time you can listen to it at night I wake up and hear Brother Brown and preaching because Connie's can't sleep and then when I hear Brother Randall preaching I get anointed I'm hearing the word of God one quote after another quote then I'm awake but I will never tell her to turn it off I want you to listen to tapes but it'll never replace them live preaching in this pulpit [Applause] there's a reason why we're doing that you know maybe you're away from here you don't know the logistics of this building we're getting full here we're getting full of people that what I prayed for people that want to worship God people that are happy to come to church people that cause no drama and if you live somewhere another and you're nothing but a drama stay where you're at I will go into cycloth and Ashes I wasn't kidding I was again Samson never thought he'd be at a grinding meal never thought can you imagine his memories he's blind now I won't be much longer he's blind now and he's pushing against the post that is turning the meal to feed the Philistines history tells us that it was a meal that was in the Town Square this is the place where they put prisoners and it was also a place where people this is hard for me to believe but it was a place to where people could walk up and make fun of the people that was grinding the devil will do to you once he talks you into sin then he'll he'll call the police on you he'll be go before God and tell God what you've did and and he was pushing he didn't have five or six other people with him he was alone pushing no preachers no prophets were there encouraging him he was alone and he's pushing and he's pushing it seemed like an eternity one day would be an eternity to me it was like God told me he said hell's Eternal I said you better you better pray it ain't the way you're living you've been afraid of the internal and Samson they had shaved his head because that's where his strength was at that's not talking about you they had shaved his head and he had Seven Locks on his back that went down his back and whenever he felt weak he could reach back and touch those locks and he would become anointed again and he would have Victory after victory and we get tired and he'd touch those locks and those locks he would bounce on his back and he could feel as long as I'm got them God's with me any and he began to dabble in sin he noted it wasn't right Hey listen to Drunk the homeless man knows there are certain things that ain't right but he don't have God to help him to overcome I'm not throwing a stone at them I'm preaching the gospel that'll clean them up but but Samson kept dabbling and for a while he got by with it he'd break the he'd break the courts and he would go back well nobody knows they think I'm a hero so he would wind up back into Lala's house again and then she would ask him where's your secret and she began to she began to pasture him and she pastured him and he got in his flesh to where it was vexing him unto death and finally he gave up his secret polished his church up to where it be just like the Baptist you see where we link around say brother on you you're going back 20 years you don't know what I dealt with 20 years ago and the leadership of that church is now in believe the sign and and listen it blinded a lot of people with their psychology I do not want to link up with that do you know how thrilled that I set when I heard brother Timothy preach and Andrew preach and they preached with the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost listen I know what this word will produce I don't need Dr Dobson I don't need the psychologist the world to mix it in to make it feel good I don't need the shiny tooth pastor that went from 3000 to 66 000 people I'm not looking for that kind of kingdom I'm looking for the kind of people that are getting ready for a rapture [Applause] can you imagine the thoughts of what it's like to push that meal and remember a thousand people dying at your hands carrying the gates of the city you talking about a haunted feeling how many decades can people live trying to sear their conscience to where they don't feel the pain anymore I made a statement here you made a choice look where you'll be five years from today look where you'll be five years from today I was at the County Fair and this girl came running up to us and saying hello I had no clue who she was no clue no clue I had no idea and when she walks away I looked at Connie Connie's going to blame me don't blame me don't believe me don't believe me who's she going to get Nancy's going I had her I had her they were going to get some kind of sugar cake we call them things funnel cake funnel cake there will be funnel cake in heaven with sugar all on top of it too there'll be strawberries and cherries Maybe sister Connie is not going to fix me no dinner and I turned to Whitney and I said Whitney we were going to the duck building because Zoe loves ducks Ducks she's in love with Donald Duck like your daughter is in love with pigs later on she gonna figure out what you do with them pigs but Zoe's loving Ducks right now she just danced in front of them Ducks but I asked her I said who is that see you know her I said no I don't know her she said that's so-and-so I said are you serious you see now I was getting a glimpse five years later I want to say this to you before I go too far sin [Applause] sin will take you further than you ever thought you can't sin and get by with it it will take you further than you ever thought you'd go brother on I didn't mean to do this and I didn't mean it Judas didn't mean to kill Jesus but he lined himself up with the modern church and they gave him money for what he did he couldn't live with himself so he went and hung himself on a tree foreign listen Samson begin to decide I know where I messed up and he began to believe and brother Brandon preaches this sermon on many occasions and he makes some real points he said he began to pray and he's admonishing the churches that he's preaching go back go back to where you left him go back to where you left him that formal that formal worship go back to the Holy Ghost go back ichabod's written over your door go back and he's telling them go back get your Holy Ghost Field preacher get your board out get your Holy Ghost Field leadership in your church Samson knew what it would cost him his own life brother Ron but I have to make difficult decisions my family might leave me and and my wife decides I don't want this no more and and if I wind up in a tent I'm still going to believe this word this word is worth more than anything in the world let me just drop something right here in the office of brother Ed hammermeister I knew who the young man was but he wanted he wanted to hook and he walked in he said brother Ron all I want is a hug I had preached to him for years in Switzerland and he would been one of the interpreters there brother Andrew it shattered my heart you know all this it shattered my heart he was from Ukraine and his his place is utter nothing but ashes but his wife decided I don't want no more of this and he said I gotta move where this is alive and he moved to air to hammermeister's church one of the best a manners in the building he's alone if his family wants nothing to do with him but he chose this [Applause] he chose this listen he made phenomenally difficult choices no hope to get her back no hope to get his family back I'll take the way with God's despised View listen his name written in the Lamb's Book of Life there's going to be great reward for him some of you have paid some incredible price but there's going to be great reward for you now Sampson had come to the point in his life to where now he could feel the locks on his back and his enemy no longer was shaving him now he's pushing and he's had a prayer meeting and in that prayer meeting he says what's more I don't need a dozen more once more once more let me fill your spirit one more time when they invited him to make sport of him they didn't realize that his once more was getting ready to happen when a little child was leading him was leading him into the Coliseum and they were going to make fun of him today oh they were worshiping all they were no doubt had their music oh no matter they had their great leaders calling our enemy we're going to let our enemy make sport today we took the gods he said he had servant the Living God the only living and true God we captured him look what he looks like he's blind and having to be led by a little child but that little child brother Randy was leading him to the right spot that child did not have a architect degree nor an engineering degree but God anointed that child to where that that child would know which two pillars that that whole building would stand on I've often asked myself the question and I'll ask it when I get to heaven what happened to that little child I'd really like to know and he began to pray and he put his hands on the pillow can you imagine what it felt like brother Greg it must have been such a phenomenal feeling to him he knew he was going to die he knew that that's all right that's all right I want to die with this anointing I'm happy I'm happy with this I'm happy with this and he put one hand on one pillar and he put another hand on another pillar he prays that prayer one more time once more can you imagine what it felt like when he began to feel those pillars move can I compare it just for a moment to Noah feeling that Ark beginning to float can I take you back to Abraham and Sarah looking in the mirror and they're young again can I can I just go to this spot when Jesus looks at the Devil and says give me the keys Hallelujah Hallelujah this wasn't the end for Samson his Champion would walk to his prison cell and said would you like to go with me I've just paid the price for your Redemption would you like to walk with me and go back to Israel again watch more I'll take it I'll take it today God bless you this morning [Applause] what will it feel like when you feel your body change you might remember this sermon more than any other and brother Ron told us what it's going to feel like Hallelujah well I feel like a young man right now I feel like a young man I love you with all my heart I love you with all my heart [Music] boy cry [Music] other [Music] apy trust me by oh I'm crying
