========================================

out [Music] Oh [Music] it makes me want to see when I go to thinking about my king I can't praise Him enough I could never express it through through all the words in the dictionary how much I love him how much he means to me the god I serve sister julia is big enough the god I serve is strong enough the god I serve is wealthy enough the god I serve amen is good to be in the house of the Lord if you have your Bibles this evening or turn to the book of Mark chapter 8 in verse 34 thank you for praying for us last weekend as we were there with the young people at brother Joe greens youth banquet and with brother Danny and we certainly enjoyed our time there and I know that the young people were certainly blessed and looking forward to seeing brother Joe next weekend and whether Joe is a part of our family part of my mind my wife's natural family but he's a part of the family of God and I'm just thrilled to have brother Joe amongst us next weekend hey man we'd like to speak to you tonight on a thought on never ashamed a very simple thought but I'd like to speak to you on this thought never ashamed mark chapter 8 and verse 34 and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the Gospels the same shall save it what shall it profit a man profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul notice whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation I believe that describes and depicts the age that we're living in of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels how many here has a need that you'd like to take before the Lord evening amen let's bow our hearts before him tonight in prayer Heavenly Father we come to you and the precious name of our Lord and our Savior Lord were your children today and Lord we are hunger in the whedon want to be fed Lord and our desire is for for more of you and less of ourselves today father we pray that you would stretch out your hand of mercy upon your children upon those that are needy hear those hands that were lifted up father you know the heart's desire below it father we pray that you'd minister to them in a supernatural way we pray that you would take the Horn of the oil or the anointing oil and pour it over your children and Lord and envelope us in your presence here tonight and speak through us to us through your Holy Word tonight through these few words of man father we pray that you'd speak to us Lord we know that your word is anointed already but I pray that you would anoint Lord your servant Lord anoint the ears I pray that you'd speak to us tonight and we'll be careful to serve you and give you all the praise and honor and Jesus Christ's name and the bride says and you can have your seats this evening a man's we said would like to speak to you on this thought or never ashamed I know that as we just kind of set a little basis here we could take this all kinds of different ways but we'll just trust that the Lord would lead us tonight in the direction in which he'd like to take us I know that in life and especially in a young person's life or any person sitting here I'd say that if all of us were honest here this evening there's there's been certain times in our lives that we have either made our self ashamed or made our parents ashamed or embarrassed of what the things or the actions that we have done by our conduct and by our character I'm sure that we could all say here if we would all just just agree for a moment to say that yeah there's been times in life that I did some things that that I that embarrassed myself and and maybe as a young person you don't even realize things that you're doing right now but you'll look back on them later on in life and you'll say man that was very embarrassing moment in my life and and you know there's some people that there's some people that just seem like they can never get embarrassed they never get rid in their face but yet you know I find in life that I've been I've been hurt in life a few times I've been I've been embarrassed in my life but I couldn't imagine my heavenly Father saying to me that I'm embarrassed by your actions I'm sure that there's a lot of things that in our in our own lives that there have been things that we've done and we have done and committed against God that there are moments in our life that we're so thankful that there's a blood there we're thankful that there's mercy still on the throne because surely I know that I'm setting a bunk amongst a bunch of angels but I know that there might be a few humans here tonight that understand what I'm saying that there have been moments maybe in this past week that you have had an embarrassing moment as a Christian maybe maybe had a little slip of the tongue or maybe you let somebody down or maybe you let God down but you know I can't imagine to get there and to face and a mighty and a judgmental God on that day without the blood I can't imagine him to say to me depart from me I never knew you because you embarrassed me I'm embarrassed by your actions that word a shame means embarrassed or guilty by one's actions characteristics or associations and and I and oftentimes maybe we're embarrassed because of what our friends have done but we know that birds of a feather flock together the word ashamed means reluctant to do something through fear or embarrassment or humiliation you're reluctant to do something and a lot of times people are reluctant to to say that they're a Christian so that they save themselves the embarrassment of the peer pressure of the world that they live in or save themself of of the humiliation as a young person oftentimes that's where you deal with it but oftentimes you'll face it on your job or face it out in the world you many times you'll hear it maybe you'll shy away from saying that you're a Christian but I want to say that I'm never ashamed to bear say that I'm a Christian in the message the shamed he said I think of the prophets of old when they come with that message and it embarrassed the kings that made people feel uncomfortable and that's exactly what the message does today it makes people uncomfortable it embarrasses them and these priests they would even feel uncomfortable because they were supposed to be leaders religious men the word came forth in that manner it exposed them and they felt embarrassed or ashamed and that's the same thing today you that's what the word does this is the house of correction and it goes through those spots in your life maybe that you're ashamed of it but yet this is the place where you can fix those spots of embarrassment that you don't have to live that way the rest of your life you don't have to live in embarrassment or insane menteur in guilty there's a god that's here that it that is here to to set you free to set you free from your bounds of I've ashamed this and to to lay upon you a a robe of righteousness but you know today that they will live in it such a sociably or a politically correct day that men want to say things that pleasing to everybody you can't say anything anymore without offending somebody so as you know it's a Christian I'm just going to say what the word says so it's long it may it may offend somebody it may hurt somebody's feelings but as long as I'm on the word no matter if no matter if I sit back and think my Jesus did I really say that as long as it's upon the basis of the word I could never be ashamed of his word my word surely I could be ashamed of but his word I could never be ashamed of but we find the day that we live in it's a day where where people are ashamed to call the name Jesus it's it's not politically correct to say the name Jesus anymore and sister Charlene was sharing something with me last week as we were on that on the way down to North Carolina that there was a woman that was in her class I wouldn't say a lady but a woman who has in her class that had told her professor that there are certain words that that just trigger her that offset her they're their words which to set her off their trigger words and the top one on the list was the name Jesus that was her trigger word her top trigger word was the name Jesus but I find it so amazing today but that is the only name in which circumcised Asian is through the name of Jesus you see men are ashamed of the name of Jesus they don't want to call that name you see they're ashamed of the life that's behind that name they're ashamed of the power that's behind that name they're ashamed of the character that's behind that name they're ashamed of the name of Jesus they're ashamed of that name but you know I find it so amazing that that they're not ashamed to take the Lord's name in vain but yet they're ashamed to be called by that name they are saying to to speak that name they don't want you speaking that name around them or it might just trigger them and they'll have them self a little hissy fit they know what you're saying the name Jesus because there's so much power in the name of Jesus that it'll drive back every fear it'll drive back every sickness and every every temptation there's so much power in it that the devil don't want that name mentioned around him that's why people enjoy hanging out in cemeteries is because they they they stay there where the devil wants to keep them and the name of Jesus is nowhere near a dead place but you know I find it amazing that when when nobody wants to say the name Jesus no more but yet get yourself in trouble and you find yourself calling on the very Jesus that you did not want to be identified with find yourself in a spot when you're in trouble and call on the name Jesus people are same to be called by the name of Jesus or call on the name of Jesus but I'm not ashamed I'm not a saying you wait you wait until the doctor says you only got six months to live and you call on the name of Jesus you go you get yourself in a spot when the doctor says you got cancer of the breast or yea cancer of the throat you got three allocates or but he got this that or the other and you'll find yourself calling on the name Jesus I shall never be a sane of the mighty one the great I am as Christians we should never allow the name Jesus to depart from our lips unless it's in holy and pure matrimony with a saint where they say two five thought in mind we should speak that name when fear starts rising speak the name Jesus when cancer starts raising its ugly head speak the name Jesus oh I say to you and politically correct people don't want you saying the name Jesus oh I would not do it just to offend you but do not tell me not to say the name Jesus behind that name is my salvation behind that name is power behind that name is healing behind that name is deliverance you can do what you want to of your life but as for me don't say that word it's a trigger word for me you know I found in life that's a trigger word for me as well you know I find that a lot of times as the demons of Hell begin to scream when they realize that I got my finger on the trigger because they know that it'll blow Satan right back to hail demons tremble at that name well don't touch the trigger you know sometimes I just get trigger-happy when I go to dealing with the devil well it's my trigger word you're absolutely correct it's my trigger word men are ashamed of the anointing today they don't dare don't dare say Amen don't dare call on the God of heaven there are same to that pillar fire right there they're ashamed of the message they're shamed of the Prophet but I shall never be ashamed if we look over in the book of Esther we would see there that the King one of the greatest kings of the world at that time a high Souris known as search sees that that King had a had a great feast and he called the Queen to come by him but she wouldn't do it she refused to do so and he was so embarrassed he was so ashamed so humiliated that his own wife wouldn't even come to his feast that he was having I think that's all away a lot of that's I think that's a whole lot like Christ today Christ has invited us to set in heavenly places with him and were ashamed of it many people are saying to say that they got the baptism of the holy ghost Pentecostal people that's right they're ashamed to say we're ashamed of him and so the Queen wouldn't come and she refused to come it humiliated him and his face turned red and everybody everybody in the kingdom noticed that fast he would not come to the feast you know this is the greatest privilege that I've ever had in my life to be able to call on the King's name to be able to worship in his name to say that I'm a part of him and he's a part of me but you see investees refusal and investees demise here came Esther's birth and her and her eyes and her her initiation into the kingdom you see there's been those that have turned Christ down but it brought about for us a great triumph there's been those that do not want to call on the name of Jesus but it is it is by that name that we are the Queen of Heaven and I say to you never be ashamed of your position the Bible says in Romans 9 and 33 as it is written behold I lay in Zion assembling a stumbling stone in Iraq of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed second Timothy 1 and 12 for the which cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I am NOT a saint Oh hallelujah I was appointed by Christ I was called by Christ nevertheless I am NOT a saint I am NOT embarrassed I am not guilty for I know whom I have believed if you're sitting there and you're ashamed to be identified with me tonight it's because you do not know in whom you have believed I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day and another thing that that being ashamed does it shows you that you're not sure of what you're talking about if you know what you're talking about and have the assurance that you know what you're talking about you can tell anybody about that you're not ashamed you see there's no way that I walk to this pulpit tonight unless I knew that he was with me but because I know that is with me I can walk foolish shortly through this pulpit tonight that he said he never leave me that he would give me the words to speak that the Holy Ghost is in me I can walk here assuredly knowing that he's here but if you feel put out or out of place it shows that you're not sure and we find that too often today when when men are unsure themselves and women are ensure of what they believe in or what they stand for we live in a day where people don't even know who they are I was so just the other day that there's four different genders nowadays people don't know what they are you're either a boy or a girl or something else or a horse men are lovers of themselves more than they are the lovers of God but yet something on the inside of that human being wants to attach themselves with a covering with a religion they wear where they can cover them health and appease their guilty conscience so that they can feel safe and sure they won't attach himself to some Creed or some kind of religion but you see America a long time ago wanted and voted in sissified preachers that we're not staying upon the Word of God where sissified preachers are ashamed to say what the truth is not only will they be held responsible for what they have said but they will be responsible for what they have not said see if you're ashamed you're unsure you're embarrassed and there they are unsure in the God that they're serving you look at the you look at the world I'm not I'm not pointing no fingers and nobody it's only by grace and I know and whom I have believed but you look at the world they don't know what they believe in they just point to a church or they point to a bishop or they point to a pope and they want to leave everything on the Pope but I'm afraid sometimes that that tries to enter itself in to the message and say well I'm just gonna leave it up for the pastor or the preacher to do it it's your job to get on your knees it's your job to pray it's your job to read it's your job to sing it's your job this house don't let the sound leader do it don't ever be ashamed a Full Gospel lighthouse and what it stands upon for what we stand upon is the full gospel [Applause] people have no clue what they believe in no more I was sent a clip this week of people actually sitting down at having a church service confessing their sins to plants own the one that sustains him and feeds them they confess their guilt they confess their shame they confess all of their sins upon this plan they have not worshipped one bit who made that point and you cannot worship tonight unless there is a blood you see if you have a bloodless religion you have a powerless religion there's no power to remit or take away sins that plant has no power this fake plant right here just does as good as that real plant it has no atoning power to take away your sins now if I was serving a god like that I could be ashamed of something like that but I'm not serving a god that I have to be embarrassed about this God washes me this Scott changed me this scott feldman this scott save me i shall never be ashamed glory you take a look out you take a look out on the streets and you can see that it's weak pulpits that are producing the lifes that are lived out there in the early 1900's they would lock you up for walking down the street the way men and women walked down the street they'd lock you up for walking down the street with no clothes on but they just passed a law in six states where women can walk down the street completely topless and they'll all can't do nothing about it this is the age of insanity men are no longer women are no longer ashamed to strip their clothes off they're not a same they're not a shame they're not a shame to come out and have their own movement and say don't you dare touch me they're they they are unashamed they're completely they're not ashamed of their actions but don't you dare try to push Christ or middle don't you dare contest their thoughts oh my I've heard people say you know it used to be the same for men to dress like women and women dress like men I say to you it's still a shame it's still a shame for a man to put on a woman's clothes and it's still a shame for a woman to put on man's clothes they're not ashamed to strip off their clothes just take a look at the world today you look at the haircut so today they look like a half shaven rooster walking down the street they want to produce the life that's on the inside of them that's an idiot that's inside of them well I'm expressing myself you absolutely are expressing yourself you're expressing the realm in which you are birthed from you can look at my natural voice you can search throughout my my lineage there's nothing but bootleggers and cutthroats and all kinds of hypocrites and all kinds of things in my natural birth there's a lot of things I could say good about my natural birth but there's a lot of things I can never brag or pull but I can brag a whole lot about my second birth come on somebody your great granddaddy granddaddy ran moonshine on a mountain too and you can be ashamed of that but your Poppa God that birthed you into the heavenly kingdom you can never be ashamed of that birth in that bud he's a perfect blood that washes our sins away well glory you look over in a Bible in Genesis chapter 2 and 25 it says to you that had him and Eve were naked and they were not ashamed you see because they were under the veil of the Holy Spirit but Satan slips into the garden and swept over the veil of lust over Eve Eve and it cause he closed the fog and today you look at the prophecy in Revelations 3 and 14 of the age that we're living in where an age where they're naked blond and miserable and don't even know it but you see they're not under the veil of the Holy Spirit they are under the veil of lust they are so filthy that they don't even know that they're naked I want to say to you Church don't you ever be ashamed to stand for what's right you may have to live peaceably as possible with all men but sometimes it's not possible to live peaceably with all men young people never be ashamed of your mother never be ashamed of your father it was your mother that birthed you into this world you better watch her she may take you out of this world don't you ever call her your old woman oh yeah he'll old man you honor him you honor her don't you be the same to them in front of your friends you can all recall that story that woman as she was coming home from college she was on a train ride back home and she'd window later college and his mother this girl's mother had sent her away to college he had worked her way in and scrubbed her way on a washboard to pay for this girl's college and she sent her away for four years and once he was coming back home here she had a friend with her that didn't know God she got away from church got away from God and as he pulled back up to the station there was an old Haggard looking woman that was scarred all over her face and all over her body and this girl's friend said all wouldn't you hate to have to sit down at the table with such an ugly looking creature like that and the girl just turned her head and didn't say nothing about it she was ashamed and embarrassed it was that girl's mother she got off she got off the train and that woman came up and hugged her wrapped her arms around her said my daughter my daughter I so love you I and the girl just turned herself and walked away from her mother she said what's happened to you what's happened to you and the conductor knowing the story went up to her said Mary are you ashamed are you embarrassed by your mother do you mean to tell me that you're ashamed and embarrassed to call her your mother in front of your friends don't you remember what she did for you when you were a little baby your mother was outside she was outside we're doing the wash and hanging up the clothes and a fire broke out and the fire station came nobody would door playing you were a little bitty baby and you were crying in the upstairs and they there was nobody that would go up there but your mother ran through those flames she ran up the stairs and she grabs you and took the clothes off of her own body and wrapped them around you and the Dacey's ugly because she was protecting your beauty don't you never be ashamed of your heavenly father oh yes he's got scars all over his body he was beaten but he made himself ugly so that you could be made beautiful he left the ivory palaces of glory and stepped down for you how could I ever be ashamed of him if Jesus was considered bales above by this world he was laughed and scoffed at and hung on the cross and made shame for me I'm more than happy to bear the reproach of His Holiness call me a Holy Roller whatever you want to call me whatever remark you want to make that doesn't stop at a bit I'm only happy this morning that in my heart the resurrected Christ lives and reigns I'm one of his subjects first Peter 4 and 14 if ye be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of God rest if upon you and on that part he is evil spoken of but on your part but on your part he is glorified but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody in other men's matters that means keeping those out of it yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on this sure they go mock you sure they gonna make fun of you but you've got nothing to be ashamed about the message they're mocking is the person Christ that lives in your soul let them make fun of him they will make fun of him they're gonna make fun of you but they're not making fun of you they're making fine of the God that's in you they can mock this pillar fire they can talk about it they can talk about this prophet they can talk about this message but I will never be ashamed I can sing like a little sorrow says look at the Lord and stuff look what the Lord has done he here my body he saved my mind he saved me just in time oh look what the Lord has done today we have to have the best we have to have the best homes we have to have the best clothes what will we do when we stand in the presence of those men who wondered and goat skins and sheep skins no place to lay their heads wondering about him deserts and somebody can make fun of us and we're ready to quit church and not go back anymore what Christianity requires today we ought to be ashamed of ourselves not ashamed of this gospel Paul said in Romans 1 and 16 for I am not ashamed say with me I am not ashamed say it to you believe it I am not ashamed for the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek I'm not ashamed of this gospel if you're afraid to testify to your friends is showing that you're ashamed Noah wasn't ashamed to testify to his friends they sure seemed foolish to everybody that was living in his day that gob was going to send down rain from heaven in which they had the instruments to tell Noah they no such thing as called water up there but he was not ashamed to preach this gospel for a hundred and twenty years while everybody around him was mocking him making fun of him trying to build of trying to build a gospel that was sure to sink Noah was not ashamed of the gospel that would rise him up then why should we be ashamed of this gospel that has risen us out of the dog bus and out of the Creed's and has called us to come out and be ye separate Moses Abraham wasn't ashamed he wasn't ashamed to testify that he was going to have a baby by his wife Sarah even when it looked humanly impossible for it to take place when everything the doctor said that it wasn't going to happen he still testified that he was going to have a baby all of his friends making fun of him said yeah father of Nations but you ain't got one son yet but he was not ashamed to testify that God had talked to him and he staggered not at the promise of God but he was strong giving praises to God because of the promise it may look humanly impossible but Abraham considered not his own body when I look at this old flesh I consider not this body for the rapture you see I consider not these 16 elements I don't know how these 16 elements are going to get me out of here I know there's something packet on the inside of my soul that one of these morning's gravity is going to turn loose I'm not ashamed of it Abraham wasn't ashamed of it Moses wasn't ashamed of it to walk out of Egypt where he was heir to the throne and he turned down the wealthiest kingdoms that there was but the Bible said that my faith Moses when he came to years Hebrews 11 and 24 when he came to years he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ he joined in the reproach of Christ whoa hallelu greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had recompense he had respect unto the recompense of his reward you read over this so easily that this is just another story of Moses this is just a story about a man that that went out to the desert see the bush that was on fire came back told told Pharaoh I'm I'm taking him by with me walk out and goes through the Red Sea it's more than a story this was a huge huge deal for this man to walk out of Egypt to leave everything and come back when Pharaoh had the greatest army there was in all the world at their time had the greatest horses had the greatest chariots but he was not ashamed to walk back up in the face of Pharaoh and tell him I met God face to face young people that's what it takes is you meeting God face to face you see if you just said well I've got a full bounce of a lighthouse and you've never had a true experience there will be a moment in your life when you are ashamed of Christ I'm sorry but that's just the way it is you see you've got to have an experience where you can say that I met him I met him face to face Moses would have never walked back down there to Egypt being a castaway known as a murderer known as a man that kills the Egyptians and walk back down there and said I'm coming down here to take over this is more than a story this is you this is you are you willing to walk down to your egypt and say i have come to take over young people hopi but everybody here are you ashamed to walk back up in the pharaoh i say i sold out and the guy that i'm mad is a god that's with me this God told me I am the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and I am come down to deliver my people I want to tell your parents God has not forgotten you Moses was not ashamed to walk in front of Pharaoh I said let my people but then Pharaoh wanted to offer Moses is so far religion that's exactly what the devil wants to do you I said loud now you go ahead and you worship your God go all the way out there but just go out there and take just take your women and your children believe your cattle here you'd go out there and you go you can go this far and I'll let you get out they did the same devil we face today young people well he'll offer you he will offer you a hand clapping he'll offer you a praise or he'll allow you to say Amen but he he wants to offer you that so far religion he not want you to go outside his walls but there's a mighty angel of deliverance coming down to take over he offered him a so far religion and Moses walked up before Pharaoh he wasn't ashamed to tell him that they
