amen amen amen he might make us sick he might torment us but our soul is out of reach to satan's grip hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah amen amen i want to speak this morning on satan couldn't touch a risen savior hallelujah if you will turn with me in your scriptures this morning to john chapter 20 and verse 11 john chapter 20 and verse 11. this is still easter season and jubilee season and i know i know brother i thought these two guys last weekend preached the best that they'd have ever preached they preached great before but i thought they just did awesome and and so i just have some things on my heart last night i thought andrew was going to preach my sermon so and i was just going i was just going to get up and go ditto and everybody say amen and we dismiss amen john chapter 20 and verse 11. but mary stood without the sepulcher weeping and as she wept she stooped and looked into the sepulchre and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain and they said unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto them because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him and when she had said thus said thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus and jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seeketh thou and she's supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou hath borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and i will take him away and jesus said unto her mary she turned herself and said and saith unto him ramona because nobody could call her name like he could call her name and jesus saith unto her touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god and mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord that he had spoken these things unto her you may be seated i want you to just notice the greatest event that had ever happened in history it was this type of a woman that jesus wanted at the tomb if you remember he assigns her and makes sure that she comes to the tomb she's washed his feet maybe she's been with him and no doubt they wanted to stone her but but let me just let me just say this to you he tells her that that she's going to anoint his body and so she is there on a commission to anoint with spices the body of jesus christ because he needs a witness that's what he's done today he's chose you to be a witness in this day in this laodicean darkness when the world is in total chaos when the son of man has been delivered into our hands and we have ate the book and we're the people we're literally more than a book we're more than tapes we're more than pictures but we're word and flesh living and he's chosen us as witnesses of his word jesus is standing there and and he's and he's beginning to speak to her now no doubt a lot of things have happened in dimensions because jesus has been a dimension traveler now remember he's been descending through the old testament and we can see him in creation we can see him in the garden of eden we can see him fellowshipping with abraham as a as a fire as a voice we can see him descending as he becomes the authentic body and he becomes melchizedek and he makes a promise to abraham that he's going to be the father of nations and a man that is 100 years old now has tribes to come out of him and now and now we watch him as a will within the middle of the will we see him as moses moses saw him at a burning bush that was him that was him that was god that said let there be that was more than a manifestation of god that was god in a burning bush that was him that was god sitting with abraham the one that said let there be and the sun rolled into existence and the stars came into existence and and he created a garden of eden that was him in a burning bush that was a him as a wheel within the middle of the wheel that was him as a rock in a sling that would kill goliath that was him that was a fire between daniel and a group of lions [Music] that was him that met shadrach meshach and abednego in the fire that was him that was him no doubt the devil being the anti-type of god let me just say complete different polarity god created his own enemy and so he creates light and he creates darkness he creates love and satan develops and perverts it love and becomes hate there's a thousand more adjectives that i can use right here god creates peace and satan creates war do that in your life if you're not careful and god not only has god condescended and descended himself in making his way towards the body of jesus christ he's been doing that for thousands of years making his way into the body of jesus christ god wanting to become man because as god he can't he can't forgive sins in that form but he has to become man to where that he can send that body to hell that sacrifice had to be accepted it had to be a bleeding bloody lamb a perfect lamb a perfect life god had to come to earth in a body as he had descended notice now let me just say this to you it's very difficult for humanity to see god in the now form real heart they missed moses they missed elijah they missed they missed the prophets they missed elijah they missed the prophet in this day and they missed jesus christ he was standing in their synagogues he was standing healing their people he was he was multiplying and taking the power of creativity and their eyes were blinded by denominational filters [Music] amen notice the first written encounter that we have between jesus and satan now jesus has been watching that light come all the way down even his birth then at 12 years old he explains things about the word that no prophets ever explained and and satan had to be gone that's got to be him that's got to be him and if that's him i got to stop him if that's him i got to stop him i got to stop him i saw what he did in the garden of eden and it was a blood sacrifice and if that's him he's moving from the blood of bulls and goats and sacrifices if that's him that all of these prophets have been talking about if that's him i gotta stop him so every religious spirit every perverted spirit now is at war with this one man one man on the earth walking healing sick healing the blind forgiving a man no man has ever forgiven another and been able to forgive sins walking to the pool none of their churches have produced any of this every name that they could name against him didn't stop him every question as they would question him as he preached didn't stop him we've come to the garden of the garden of gethsemane and he says father if it be thy will let this cup pass from me he was sent there to crush the head of satan's kingdom he was sent there to do what moses couldn't do what david couldn't do elijah couldn't do john the baptist couldn't do william branham couldn't do jesus christ was sent to this earth to crash and destroy to crash and destroy satan's kingdom when he's standing before pilate pilate calls him a king and he asked him about his kingdom and he said if my kingdom was of this world my substance would come and fight he was standing with a much bigger picture than jerusalem he's standing with a much bigger picture than america today he's standing with a much bigger picture than this church and this assembly he's got a plan [Applause] a lot of things happen that are unseen the disciples no doubt became confused what a confusion it would do god just allows things to happen to confuse a lot of people the man said he'd actually say things that would confuse people you know to shake off the unbeliever he said jesus did that he said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part and people walked away the carnal believer just walked away we're not having none of that brother man preaches serpent see tens of thousands of these people walked away but that's been preached all through the bible it's not a new doctrine it's been preached all through the bible it's not brother branham's revelation it's been all the way since cain and abel just shook the unbeliever off tells them who they are jesus would say to the pharisee and those those ecumenical men of that day you're your father the devil that's much plainer language than you heard last night you have your father the devil they said a lot of words trying to get him to step into a broken humanity trying to get him to think evil thoughts trying to make every kind of rumor that you can make about him trying to break him down even standing here and he's standing with pilate to the sin was i born they're spitting on him they're mocking vinegar is given to him a black man is asked to carry his cross to calvary's heel god predestinated all of that to happen that weak beaten body and every stripe that satan tried to stop him with he did not realize that the stripes that i'm giving jesus is going to heal ron spencer is going to heal my people and satan was taking all of his cruelty out on that piece of sacrifice to fulfill isaiah 53. he was doing everything to beat him and modeling frustrating trying to become so human and show his weaknesses until he would call an angel because he knew he had power because he'd ask him on a mountain if thou be the son of god satan from the beginning had a good idea that this might be him and if it is him i got to get him stopped and he's trying to get him to use his god-likeness [Applause] to call thousands of angels because if he can get calvary stopped if he can get calvary stopped he still has a lien against you but the moment that he quits breathing and he says it is finished the moment the second the one millionth of a second that he quits breathing we're free [Applause] he walks in hell and i don't have time but he walks through hell the deepest darkest regions of hell and takes the keys of satan he defeats satan once and for all and he does every bit of it because god's not going to accept lambs and turtle doves and goats anymore he has prepared a blood himself not part mary not part joseph all god a virgin-born son of god all god gave himself for you the king of kings the lord of lords become your kinsman redeemer yes he showed him on a hillside where those pieces represented and any bible scholar here knows that each one of those pieces was a clean animal represented the sacrifice of jesus christ he was the ram he was the heifer was made the waters of separation that had you separated through now we have the washing of the water by the blood of separation from sin and through the word through the through believing and the pigeon and the turtle love was divine healing and all was in christ and their god showed abram what he was doing and through the seed of abraham he would bring forth his only begotten son christ and was slain yonder between heavens and earth and the sun went down in the blackness over the earth and there he tore him apart god pulled his soul out of him and he wrote a covenant with the families of the earth remember program said god swore by himself when he could swear by no greater glory he said my god my god why hast thou forsaken me his face full of mockery and spit a crown of mockery pulled down over his brow nails drove those roman spikes his back ribbon his rib showed through swinging on a cross screaming dying dying a sinner's death the sin of the world was upon him you never take that for granted the only man-made things in heaven will be the scars in his hands as an eternal reminder there god riveted his sides tore his soul out of him when he said into thy hands i commend my spirit he dropped his head and the earth shook and bounced out its rock there he is god's covenant there's the fulfilling of it what a powerful quote what a powerful blood here i want to i want to spend a few moments what a powerful blood that i want a woman to be the first witness i want you to think on this i wanna i'm gonna take it slow here just for a second we can shout in a few minutes but i want one of the filthiest women that i have forgiven i want one of the filthiest women that i have forgiven to be the witness of my resurrection she should be put to death they screamed the law said she should be put to death she should be put to death the law says it and it was true the sin that she was committing and jesus stoops he begins to write in the sand he that is without sin cast the first stone because they knew he knew in that atmosphere they knew he knew and they knew if he knew he could tell it and if he told come on and if he told it they was going to lose their job if he told it their their position in the community was going to be over so we'll let this harlot just stand here and the first time that jesus looks into her eyes he asked her said woman where is don accuser and she said i have none hallelujah i have none i want to ask you woman where is thine accuser because of the blood of jesus christ i have none [Applause] this is the first time he looks into her eyes but he's not done with her rachel some of you sisters kind of know what we're talking about here so stained and she spends the rest of her days with him and his flesh as a representation of what this blood can do i forgive you now now she's standing and it's her name it's her name it's the first name that he calls in that risen savior form [Applause] wow touch me not i can't let cursed earth touch me at this point you're forgiven but your humanity i can't let you touch me just now imagine how she wanted to kiss his feet again can you imagine the millions of emotions that's going through her mind she watched them put a spear in him she watched the thorns she watched him beat him she watched him breathe his last breath she spent three days of horror and now she's looking at him and he now tells her go tell my disciples i'm rising i told you a few days in the meeting that i was going to raise and if you were paying attention i have power to lay my life down and i have power to take it up again i am my father of one and he expresses his deity but he's got to die as a man i want you to just think just for a moment we're in a moment of a resurrection where satan couldn't touch him i want you to think about it he could never kill him again he can never torture him again he can never say bad things to that piece of flesh again will never suffer with a headache again he will never be hungry again he will never be in meetings to where that he will have to tussle in that humanity so satan knows i can't touch this jesus [Music] calvary paid it all he had come out of an earth he'd came out of the earth and was walking among man but he had not yet ascended and he told mary don't touch me and she said rapona and he said touch don't touch me for i've not yet ascended to my father but i ascend to my god and to your god to my father and your father what's this next statement and then that night after he had done went up before god and rose up from the dead and went up before god coming back he invited thomas to come touch his side he had ascended before god now watch this brother brown has a very important way to say some things he said you know einstein proved this is a prophet taking the greatest scientists that ever lived who many term einstein lived before his time you know einstein proved that if two forces are coming together fast enough they could pass through each other never never bother each other if two cars are coming down the road and they were going a terrific speed faster than sound just billions of miles per second they'd probably pass right through each other without hurting one another he proved that einstein proved that by forces striking together well you see we are such an earthbound people you're going to like this until about all we think about is can you think about it as time and space but when we leave this world we're going where there is no time and we can think of 50 miles an hour 100 miles an hour 2 000 miles an hour 10 000 miles an hour that don't even start when you think of eternity notice these next words how fast jesus after he had been glorified received his glorified body raised up from the dead had ascended on high to the father and come back in a few seconds and with such a terrific speed until he come right back in before his disciples through a wall and never even moved the wall and yet with the body that could stand there and eat fish and bread that speed coming through notice these words and he can come all the way from glory to your hearts as quick as you can think about him as quick as you can confess your wrongs he can run the devil out and bring himself in and just as fast as you can have enough faith to believe it hallelujah hallelujah that's how fast it's not on man it's not an ability of human being god can change your life just like that one service one minute one situation and it don't matter what anybody else says you just know [Music] there's a time you couldn't touch him there's a time you couldn't get to him but that middle wall has been turned tore down it's been tore down now it's death not to come into him and you can have as much of god as you one of him i got news for you i want enough i can shake the kingdom of hell with forgive me for having to take a little time do you remember when brother branham explains going beyond the curtain of time what a terrific story that is i just felt checked let me just hold that just for a moment brother brahm explains dimensions we never had a preacher i i do a bit of we never have a preacher ever touch dimension speaking like this prophet did amen it's because you're going to be touched by two different dimensions there's two different forces trying to get into your life one's god and one's a devil and the devil's going to work on you and work on you and work on you and i'm going somewhere with this this morning he's going to condemn you he's going to talk about you he's going to do all different kinds of things he's going to shake you he's going to try to destroy you because you're carrying a light billions of people even trillions of people in the earth why you other people have trouble sure they have trouble but why is the enemy in your ear so much he recognizes the atmosphere so he'll make you offers he'll make these offers for jobs he'll make you offers for relationships he'll make you offers for money he'll make you every kind of an offer that there is just to distract you jesus when he was here on earth because he was going to conquer hell speaks a lot about hell it speaks more about hell then actually he speaks about heaven your bible readers some of you are now by now gray-headed and got almost bible scholars so you realize that he talks about hell so it's a real place brother branham said i think that the fifth dimension is where the sinner dies now i think that when the sinner dies he he goes into this fourth dimension now let me let me just let me just say this to you when a sinner dies because it's an unconverted soul it's it's no more than the death i i don't mean to be belligerent but this is just how it is it's no more than the death of a dog or a dog of an animal because if you don't have the holy ghost you have an animalistic nature on you i didn't write the book i just died now notice he says now notice that the first thing this is sinner the first thing he cannot go into the presence of god because he is a sinner and his time is up on earth let me remember brother tim saying to us that there comes a time in your life to where your body can't sustain life it just can't sustain life i was standing i was sitting with my doctor the other day and she said you have any questions and i said i want to know where we're at she said you're a miracle she just point blank said you're a miracle she said every day that you live is a miracle in that right sister calling she said you're a miracle we've had a lot of patients through that have what you have they're gone they're gone even since you've been here you're you're you're one of a kind every day is a miracle she said do i need to get a psychologist to you to tell you that you i don't know i don't need that she said now it's kind of like a man with a heart condition he said she said he could die at any moment he said because he's got a heart condition he may he may live several years and he said he's got a heart condition said and he and he struggles with that heart condition she said the disease that you have is not heart condition it's cancer and you've got fourth stage cancer you have just as much cancer as you had when you came in here and you started she said but the chemo has has controlled it it's still there but it's controlled and then she smiled and your god [Applause] we get sermons in a lot of strange places and i was laying on the table under a blanket and god spoke to me this sermon laying there while they were looking for the cancer and it was all right there and i begin to think such a katie you was listening to i was going to share this with you on the road yesterday but you were going 90 mile an hour and i was going 30. i said i just got to share this with somebody and so katie was she'd walked to the barn and she was walking up and down the road because that's her treadmill and i just walked out i had my straw hat on i thought i'll share this with katie but can you just think of this here they are they're taking the greatest equipment that there is you're going to like this you're going to like this they're taking the greatest equipment that there is and looking for the killer cells in this body and god speaks into my ears this sermon they're looking for death and god's given me life hallelujah [Applause] let me just help you with your vision just a bit you might be focused on a few dead cells that was in the woman that was standing there but god was focused on a bigger picture she's gonna sit at my table [Applause] i want to share a couple more quotes just before we close is that all right he's talking about hell and he said if i would type it for you it's like going to sleep and you're in a nightmare you see curious things you're screaming that's the state of the wicked dead this is what he was saving us from he cannot go into the presence of god because he's a sinner how many times now i'm off the quote how many times did he turn god down how many times did she turn god down what you accepted they turned down he cannot return back to the earth because his time is up you can't get a redo if i'm speaking to somebody on the internet there's no redos here there's no redos oh when i get there i'm going to plead all different kind of there's no redos here why don't you get it fixed lay aside your pride lay aside every weight in the sin will still so easily beset you how long does it take snap your finger that's how quick i was going to have brain surgery and in a moment it was different and in a moment you were different and in a moment you were different i saw the night that it was different for you i saw it i saw it when you came to you you'd been resistant you had fought it you thought i could get to it i'm gonna sit through it and all of a sudden it's him he cannot return back to earth because his time is up and he's caught between two things in the fifth dimension he's got a soul and he cannot go into the presence of god because it's not covered by the blood he's a sinner he cannot wake himself up because his time is up on earth and there he is in a tormented nightmare think of now before you enter into a nightmare screaming many of us have had nightmares it's just because we're we're told because the two consciences are passing sub and first conscience and it catches between and that's a nightmare and when a sinner dies he's caught with his soul between the earth and hell because remember he's got to be judged and he's in a nightmare and there he stands how he's ever had a nightmare i'm on a i'm on a drug that that i take morning and night and i take it right before i go to bed and and the side effect is nightmares and i pray that god bridles the nightmare that's what i do but there's your body's made up of a chemical body so it's it's got its satan uses what he can to get into that so i'm in a relaxed state and so in that state he attacks through that dimension this very morning knowing this is a sermon that i'm preaching this very moment this morning i'm working as a preacher with some very precious friends as a preacher and these demons are screaming to me you're not good enough you're not good enough you'll never be good enough and they're screaming you're just a horrible wretch for a preacher and they're just screaming in that and i wake up sister connie's already slept on the bed and i'm waking up somewhere out right near six o'clock and i'm just bawling because it has an emotional effect and i wake up and i i sense what's going on now's the only time he can get to me now i'm going to preach to you hallelujah let me just take you to the next one forgive me brother branham said i was laying on the bed i'm 55 55 years old i believe somewhere in that neighborhood my hands behind my head and he said i'm thinking to myself i haven't done much for god listen if brother branham hasn't gone done much for god we're all toast amen where is toast it was not in five minutes in a moment he was in another dimension not a vision he called it different things in different places called it translation they said i felt my hands he said i felt my hands i've heard i've stood i stood i've sit on the platform many times with brother biscuit and brother biscuit would would rehearse it he said we were in the north country and he said eddie he said i felt my skin i could feel he's at that point in his life he was bald and he said i put my hand on my head i had a head full of hair yeah there was a just a slight moment in that translation he looked back at his body and his body was still laying there and here he was and brother branham just in that moment he's in another realm and i'm not going to tell you the whole thing and people came up and was hugging him and he specifically woman at the well woman woman that's where's thy an accuser woman mary now here's women coming up and hugging him and he was very sensitive and he notices that the sex cells in the body was gone oh what a place they're gone and they're hugging and he's not feeling that humanity this won't matter [Applause] death can't touch that place sex sales gone so that won't touch that place there'll be no wars there there'll be no putin there'll be no zelezinski there'll be no politics [Applause] brother branham said perfect amen perfect you say oh what a day that'll be i don't know if you notice this or not but if that seed that is in you is the seed of god can i can i go just a couple more moments i want to speak to the adult class in the room if that seed that is planted goes into that womb and that womb closes it seals itself off to where no contaminant i'm trying my best not to shout right now i'm doing my utter best to behave if that seed of a life happy birthday happy anniversary and that seed of life goes in there i mean and that little boy is in there and you're gonna pick his name out then you're gonna live life for nine months carrying and feeding and there's a lot of contamination in the world but god seals even the natural body to where that no contamination can go inside of that and get ahold of that seed what about your spirituals being when god gives you the holy ghost more than an emotion more than a touch when god gives you the holy ghost and it becomes the seed of life christ in you he seals the womb off he seals it off and satan can't touch you oh glory [Applause] handle me handle me handle my hands handle my feet i'm here that's what he's doing today it's what you felt here in
