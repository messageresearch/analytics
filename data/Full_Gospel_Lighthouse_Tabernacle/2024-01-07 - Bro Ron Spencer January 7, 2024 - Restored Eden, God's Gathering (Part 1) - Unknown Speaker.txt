belittle you brother Ray I said that for the victory of God hallelujah Hallelujah I just rejoiced in it brother Ray I just have to be honest with you I just rejoiced and I said this picture is a testimony of Grace it's just an absolute testimony of Grace if you will turn with me in your scriptures today to Romans chapter 8 and verse 18 amen Romans chapter 8 and verse 18 why the tuxedo today brother Ron well I learned from brother bcll if you don't feel the part look the part so there you go God bless you brother bcll amen amen are you with with me for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God this is written almost 2,000 years ago and here we are because the creature itself was made subject to vanity not willing but by reason of him that who hath subjected the same in hope because of the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God now notice these words for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adop adoption to wit the Redemption of our body the older you get the more this scripture stands out to you a't it great Revelations chapter 21 and verse one and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will be he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying and neither there shall be there any more pain for the former things are passed away I like that scripture for the former things are passed away maybe you have a need on your body that you'd like to say Lord would you come by and minister to me today I think we all feel that way Lord Jesus as we're standing here what a awesome thing that it is to be in the presence of the Lord and Lord now I ask you that you would anoint our lips and anoint our thoughts Lord as we've just had a just a a wave of a a storm that came by our way and and Lord we just ask you that you would just touch those that may be lost power Lord keep them safe on the roads and whomever it might be I ask you that you'd help us today we're in this room and we know that we're not alone but Angels stand with us and Lord your PR presence is with us today because of who we are now Lord we ask you that you would come and draw us just another step closer to you bless services that have gone on around the world and will go on May you touch us Lord as the Bride of Jesus Christ and Lord come quickly we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen you may be seated amen Genesis chapter 1 kind of tells us and gives us some glimpses of how it was how the Earth was all made I would like to if there could be a replay I would like for God to allow us to get the opportunity to kind of take us and show us how it was all done am you know but we were made before even the worlds were made the universes was made before there was even a a projection of of universes you were in his mind and if you were ever there you're as Eternal as he is eternal and just as God was slain before the foundation of the world he was slain for a reason to redeem you so never let the devil beat you around a bush somewhere or another and tell you that you're worthless or tell you that you're nobody don't never do that listen we should never really have a bad day to be very honest with you if our names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundational world there's not a president there's not an ambassador there's not a dignitary in the world that can go with with an eraser and erase it out if God thought of you before the foundation of the world he has never unthought of you Hallelujah that ought to be enough just say dismiss and we're going to praise the Lord for a week or so hereen now I want you to just notice as God begins to create brother brand begins to make some statements and I'm going to take some thoughts from Satan's Eden cruelty of sin the seals and future homes so if you want to know where this all comes from he said God Was So Satisfied as he rested from all of his works on the seventh day and hallowed this seventh day a Sabbath for him God Was So Satisfied that's quite a statement we and our Humanity are never satisfied because God looked it all over after he had been 6,000 years in molding it and fixing it out and making it come into existence and putting the mountains to come up and making the volcanoes and to push the mountains up and things that had taken place in the eruptions and fixed it in a way that he had and it was a beautiful place and there was just nothing like it the great paradises of God the great dinosaurs and whatever more crawling through it and of the great animals and no harm in them and I thought this was such an incredible sentence the great dinosaurs and the great animals and there was no harm in them [Music] amen you know I don't know about your grandbabies or your babies but now there's there's those little rubber animals and they're dinosaurs and I don't know the names of them amen Isaac's in the building and he brings his dinosaurs over in my office and you know I've got trophies all through my office but the greatest trophies I have is their toys that's the greatest trophies to me that I have is to watch them make those toys come to life now what I'm using that for is not just a statement but you know it's good that God made the Earth but literally that wasn't just what he had on his mind he was going to put himself in you on the earth to make it come to life I'll ask Isaac and he'll go I'll say Isaac what is that dinosaur and he'll spill off a name about that long I can't say it after he says it and then another one he'll bring out I'll say what's that dinosaur and well he'll say it real quick and he go that's what it is and and and I'll just kind of be Spellbound I must not have got anything in school brother Doug and you know he'll go through all the dinosaurs maybe your children have all the same and you know and uh and and then we'll we'll know that you know that all of that was there amen and there was crawling on the earth brother brandom says that God made man in spirit for him first and then he made him in flesh man and he made him to be The Keeper of the Garden of Eden you know I I be honest with you what Adam stepped out of we're getting ready to step back into it's a great big circle and God is going to restore it all he's going to restore the Earth and he's going to put it back on its axis to be the right way and this Earth is going to be redeemed like you're going to be redeemed and the whole earth is groaning to be set back up and the volcanoes and the storms and all of that there's going to be a perfect day I'm G try to behave Amen in the day that Adam was here and before the sin there was not a predator there was no uh we talked about it this week there was no there was no birds of prey there was no Predator with the bird and there was no no Predator with the animals and there was no predator in the sea it was perfect brother BR would say the animals would would uh eat grass and they would feed and everything was just perfect you know you and I Envision line laying down with the lamb they can't do that now amen amen you can't do it now they it's just not in them to be able to do it now so they get a restoration they get a restoration to where that they never die now listen I don't know it all amen I don't know it all all I can do is go through the microscope of the message of the hour and brother Brandon was allowed to look back even before the foundation of the world and he was allowed to look in the Garden of Eden because he's a prophet Seer he's not just a preacher and he's not just projecting thoughts and and it wasn't brother bram's thoughts I I want to I just want to take you I just want to take you just a couple of thoughts here to get you kind of in the mind frame it's going to take me weeks to preach it and I and I I I'll just take a little bit and we'll quit and I'll take a little bit and we'll quit quit amen is that all right brother B says I believe that the great cheram was at the East side of the gate and that sword swirling back and forth guarding the gate there that entered into Eden the fire of the Holy Spirit fire guarding that gate and today that's what guards the gate eight I love this statement he says and if you're scared of the Holy Ghost Fire you'll never get in that fire the sword of God that God is a consuming fire watching that tree guarding the tree of life he says I can see this little Halo move over over this world which was merely a sin Frozen hanging out there like a great Iceberg and he moved over near the Sun and he began to turn it like that around the sun and it be to melt and big ice glaciers tore loose and Texas was being formed and ples there and as we taught of how the icebergs come down through there the best chronological can't can figure out that that the whole world after it run down through through the Gulf of Mexico and so forth and begin to burm up with water and and the whole world without form and void he said and now here in Genesis now then God moved and separated the Fate from the waters and and made the light and he created all creations and he created all creations and he made it and all these trees come from and plants and so forth what a beautiful setup that he had he loved it and it was beautiful and he thought and he thought that was fine and so he couldn't just leave it there in that state he had to he had to leave something with it and he said let us make man plural in our image and let us make man in our image so then God made the first man not three Adams but Body Spirit and soul and he says and so then God was made in the first man he was a spirit man and and he was something on that order of of God and he said the Son of God the logos was the first man and then he gave the man jurisdiction to lead over all the animal life just like the Holy Spirit leads the believer go here and do this I'm not going to get to it but I want you to just notice remember in some statements brother Brandon made he said he would bring the animals to Adam think of this job he would bring the animals to Adam and he would say I want you to name them and he would look at their character and he would look how they were built and he'd look at their image and he'd say I believe I'll call that one an elephant we still call it that today I believe I'll call that a a chimpan and we still call it that today now for those that believe in evolution and here we are 6,000 years later and you didn't grow an extra hand so God Made You In His Image you know it take quite a bit of Faith to believe in evolution come on to believe that this all started with a big bank but I like God's evolution of how God made it you know it it it had to be incredible when Jesus was 12 years old and he was talking to all those philosophers and doctors and all of those those men of great knowledge that that had built in incredible wealth and that had incredible libraries and they had studied all the way since even before Abraham and they had certain thoughts and here was a 12y old boy right brother BR talks about it you can read about it the anti Nan fathers and how that he confounded the greatest philosophers listen for those men to want to Bow and worship him he took them Way Beyond anything that they' ever heard now let's just talk about the animals and he begins to talk about the animals and where they come from no doubt the zoologist was blowned away literally blowed away but who better to talk about it than the god that made it amen yes sir so you want to talk about how the world was made and so you talk to a man and he's got all of this all of this knowledge the thoughts that is in the libraries and and no doubt it this this convention that they're having it's the best of the best and here's a 12-y old boy do we have a 12-y old boy in the building right we are Noah Noah come up here and stand with me just a little bit you looked theart now Noah I'm I'm going to have you to stand right over there so here we have all of these scientists and all of these doctors and and maybe the doctors has all the knowledge that they've garnered since Noah amen and so since Noah they've got all these libraries and you know they think that they know what they're talking about and here's a boy begin to explain the nervous system in the body and how a hand operates how a brain operates how the heart operates the veins and the arteries and the pumping of the lungs amen why he came from the place that made it now the scripture says that Jesus took upon himself no reputation now the man that makes an artificial arm he gets a reputation or a heart transplant he gets a reputation or to be able to work on the brain he gets a reputation from that reputation he builds schools or builds libraries or many people learn under him but Jesus being God in humanity took upon himself no form of [Applause] reputation so since Noah they've gained all of this knowledge and Noah stands there and goes well this is I'm sorry Jesus stands there and goes well this is how it was made come on that's right and in a couple of days Jesus has blowed their minds now let's come 2,000 years Stephen Hawkins if you could have a conference with all the scientists and send Jesus into their midst come on they would be mind blown that's right cuz there's nobody better to explain it than the one who made it that's right amen give Noah a hand so here we have a prophet a prophet's a Seer he doesn't come out of any college he doesn't come in any denominational but he meets an angel and he's gifted in a certain way that even with his Kentucky Jeffersonville language was hot and tots and amen Egyptian Knights and no such a thing and and he and he says words that blow the minds of people and yet once translated if it's in Zimbabwe or whatever language it is you would feel comfortable with this man at your table he's so humble until he's not trying to blow you away he's trying to be able to talk to a sixth grader and let that sixth grer be able to understand amen one of the greatest statements I ever heard said you can you can be so exalted in your your thoughts and be so great in your mind and try to to explain the mysteries of God but if a a six-year-old can't understand it that's right it only means that you don't know it [Music] yourself I think that's a pretty powerful statement so God had all of these animals under submission all the tree life I want I want to tell you about the place that you're getting ready to go back to amen trees that leaves never drop off of how many ladies in here like flowers oh yeah yeah flowers that a petal never drops off of Hallelujah brother B said where you been sister Gertie well I've been down by the Rose Garden for 500 years well just think about it in that realm in that realm of of Heaven you might here be so in such a hurry you can walk through the greatest Gardens of roses and if you're there an hour you feel like you're exhausted but to go in God's rose garden and spend 500 years is nothing I don't think we can really fathom what we're getting ready to step back into so it's not just you that's looking for Redemption have I laid that out just well now I want to just leave that just for a moment but even in this Fallen condition God still has control of nature because when Adam fell death hit the earth and death swept over the Earth and now Adam is not working with an almost an eternal life condition of Eden but now he's working with thorns and thistles and grass that dies and ground that's hard and he's trying to raise plant life and and trying to get enough to eat and now he has fish that won't let him just grab it to eat it he's got a fish for it and now the lion that he rubbed is now his predator now now the animals that were not vicious before now is vicious were the animals that were just at peace like a rabbit now is running for cover but we're going back to a place and if I can speak to Nature today by the authority of a prophet God's going to fix that [Music] amen he's going to fix that little rabbit he's going to fix [Applause] that I I think one place that we should go to as we start this series God's going to destroy the Earth because of sin he's going to destroy it now he's gonna wash it cause you've got to be baptized a sacrifice has to be washed Jesus had to be washed in the Jordan River you had to be baptized it's part of the birth process part of your birth process to coming out of the womb water has to be broke blood water has to be broke pain listen the whole earth is in pain you and I are in pain because we got a body that's we're getting ready to step into we brought brother Bill the other day and he went into a horrible situation his mind was deteriorating his body was humiliating him he he wanted to be the same man he had always been witty and he wanted to be healthy and he wanted to be a lot of different things but his body was calling for another body are you with me that's what your body's doing brother Charlie it's calling for another body your body now is testifying that you got another one coming and it's not so far away amen it's not so far away it's watching over you and if we could use it use it in a term it's your guardian angel for just now but you're going to step into it are you with me sir so he's going to wash the Earth and he's going to he's going to flood the Earth it's not just a Kitty story he's going to flood the Earth sin got so bad that's it got so ugly until God couldn't let it go on and even God repented that he made man right because in their sinful condition it didn't even give a a an image of what God was like but the scripture said that Noah found Grace in the eyes of God I'm honest with you I'm glad that this this world is is horrible we're kind of sheltered here but this world is horrible amen and and and and let me just let me just say this to you I'm glad that we have found Grace by the law of election and by this predestinated message we found Grace that this message would protect us we can live kind of on almost a vision of Heaven even in this condition we're citizens of another kingdom but we can live in this earth and live such a life that this life will allow us to be raptured we won't be destroyed in a tribulation period we won't be destroyed in all that nonsense thank you Lord L and Noah found Grace Noah was a farmer he was not an engineer he was not a ship Builder he was a farmer he was a prophet but he was a farmer and Noah be to preach because of the revelation of God God's going to destroy the Earth can you imagine the scoffers got a lot today but can you imagine the scoffers in that day it's never rained it's never rained there's never been a storm like just came through here it's never had ice it never had snows and Noah was preaching that God's going to destroy the Earth and they were in such a scientific condition until they could build pyramids that were perfect and they they could send in the sky they had all of that going on they had a greater than even Sodom was on the earth it was horrendous they worshiped they they worshiped a lot of different things and they had forgotten God they totally forgotten God and it was it was it was a horrible condition but God instructed him I want you to build a boat I want you to build an ark and God picked the worst wood that he could pick gopher and he had him to pitch it with a certain tar that's right to make it waterproof and while he's building this unfathomable Arc he's preaching and he Don't Preach 10 years 15 years 20 years he preaches 120 years same message sometimes you get bored in your Humanity because they say now that the attention span of a child is about 30 seconds I can believe it I got grandbabies and I can believe that their attention span is about 30 seconds they say that an advertisement that last a minute people forget the advertisement because you buy it back so if you can have a 15 second commercial people will will catch it quicker than they will a 60c commercial it's because of your attention span and I can believe it while I'm preaching sometimes so I pray that your 30 seconds will catch back up and you'll relax for a second and then you'll catch back up another 30 seconds and Noah would preach and they make fun of him it's not a doubt in my mind that some some joined to to nail some of the nails or nail whatever that they did or helped Harvest and helped to do all that CU he could have never done it all by himself and so there were there were Believers for a while and then they be gone and then there was people that would hang around their Ark just in case now God's going to flood the he's going to flood and destroy the Earth as it was he's going to destroyed the Earth as it was but we need the zoo we need a zoo amen now I don't know where lice and mice I don't know where they all fit in theing kingdom of God I don't know where mosquitoes fit I don't know where Hornets fit I don't know where they fit I I maybe we'll ask one day but somewhere they fit in the order of the kingdom of animals and they have a purpose amen now when when Noah gets done something strange happens God sweeps the Earth with his Spirit Noah doesn't blow a horn he doesn't send out Messengers but animals come two by two I love that little little meme that you get you got to fight like you're the third monkey on I love it at least I got your 30 seconds there well brother Ron I don't believe in God will explain how that God in his greatness gets lizards from New Zealand and Australia to go all of those thousands of miles to get on an ark to get an animal that jumps and got a belly and got a hole in it amen it's got a papoose if we can say it like that I don't know what it's called and a baby can can ride in that come on that animal had to get on the ark somewhere there was a place for an elephant and a giraffe and you just call whatever name you got cuz I don't have in your 30 seconds dogs had to get on there and cats had to get on there horses had to get on there and cuz God so loved his Animal Kingdom he has to bring them are you with me now he's not going to just leave you in a wash he's going to bring you up to a next stage he's not just going to justify you but he's going to sanctify you and he's not going to just leave you there but he's going to once he gets you washed and once he gets you cleaned out he's going to fill you with the Holy Ghost what does that have to do with animals you are an animal without the Holy Ghost amen that's amen you're capable of anything in a sinful condition good people go to prison for the rest of their lives they were good one day and a spirit got on to them and they killed or they robbed or the maned or ravished and a spirit got on them that's the reason it's important that we have the Holy Ghost the king inside of our hearts or a spirit can get on you and one day you're on fire for God the next day you hate everybody around you you don't have the Holy Ghost you can get moody and hateful and jealous and in your 30 seconds you can name all those Spirits yeah in a moment you can believe a lie in the devil he whispers something in your ear and you can be so on fire for God but if the king ain't in your heart all a [Music] sudden you don't want to hear a pastor you don't want to hear Church you don't want all of a sudden church is repugnant and you got 52 different reasons you don't want to be a part of it what happened a spirit got on your [Applause] animal I think it's spon that said without God youd die like an animal even made a statement that a living dog is greater than the greatest King in the world in death think about that how important life is and how important if life is so important how much more important is the eternal life if I was sitting in your seat I would do everything I could to get everything out of every service cuz one day this building will be empty be cobwebs hanging in it I don't care what they do at this building once we're gone they have it they can do whatever they want to they can have a rock concert in here if they want to we're going to be gone you said brother Ron that's a that's an ugly statement what about your car come on you get rid of the car that you wash and you pamper and you love it and all of a sudden it's got 12,000 miles on it you you take it to a guy that's a that's a Salesman and he makes you feel like that you're getting the best deal in the world he's really lying to you but he's getting the best deal in the world and he makes you feel good oh yeah and he takes your car and you're a Christian and all of a sudden he sells it to a dope dealer that car has got no Redemption value in it this building is only good for us for a [Music] time and all these animals begin to come I'll never figure out because it was God that made that happen now if God could do that he could feed them while the worst flood that ever hit the earth he could feed them now you think about the quantum you're a guy that takes care of food brother Doug is phenomenal in the food field and you take care of conventions you take you help us with our our Labor Day stuff and you get kind of things together how much it's going to take what do we need to serve what will people eat that's important am that's really important kind of like you ladies you know what can I what can I fix this afternoon that they'll actually eat and your six-year-old eats macaroni and cheese and there's a T-bone steak right beside that macaroni and cheese and they won't touch that $15 steak that you got sitting beside it but they'll they'll eat that dollar and a quarter Mac somebody ought to be amening me right now [Applause] now you know you could have the greatest salad in the world set it down in front of me and I'll eat the vegetables off the top of it amen I like green Jello but I don't like green salad what' you think of my salad brother Ron it was green so in case you ever invite me for supper don't don't put salad as the front thing of the God bless you Sister an mayor hallelujah it's not a sin to eat a salad CU that's part of the Earth's creation it's just not the part that I ate I was built like a b a bear brother Ram said that Adam was like a man said his toes was in the ground said he was like a tree his toes was in the ground and he said God breathed into him and gave made him a living soul and he said he did the same thing for a bear so that's must have been where I came from I am a meat [Applause] eater brother brand was walking down the street and there was a there was a sidecar that a big a big what kind of what am I need to say here it was a train flatbed help me train flatbed flat car first grader all be told me that but it wouldn't come to me some things just won't come and so maybe his for family was working and there was a there was a guy there giving a speech and he had a whale on it and had a whale on it he said you know he says we have this fish here this whale but it stomach's only about the size of a man's head well weighing thousands of pounds but it stomach is only about the size of this head a man's head and said there's a story that says that um in the scriptures that says that Jonah got swallowed and said it must have been a whale but there's no way that that story is true brother brandham spoke up how many remember Amen brother brandom spoke up and he said you're wrong kind of he must have been must have been a little bit like my daddy and he said you're wrong the scripture says that it was a great fish that's right that God created a great fish it might have only been one like it in the whole world but God created a great fish now if you don't believe in God just stay with me the next 30 seconds or the 60 seconds or a minute and a half when God created this fish he made it so that a backsliding prophet would be throw out of a boat boat and he would be at the right spot to swallow Jonah and God built him to where that he would have air on the inside of him like that would be on the earth to where that Jonah could live and would have all kind of slime to which he had ate but today he was going to eat a prophet and this Prophet would go down inside of this belly of of a well like the belly of hell like Jesus would be in hell for three days Jonah would be in because it was a prophecy it was not just an event it was a prophecy so God used nature [Applause] amen God used nature to produce the prophecy and that guy may have been thinking that that this whale was like the fish that God created God created the whale but he created that fish cuz we know the results of it when he came out of that fish he preached all through ninev to which he preached to a such a message and he was wanting in his nature he was wanting them to be destroyed but he preached such conviction until that Wicked Nation went into sackcloth and Ashes and gave their heart to God the god that said let there be light created that fish what you say well brother Ron I don't believe God can create fish you want to go on a journey with me are you enjoying this so far oh yeah Jesus was standing with his disciples and they were very discouraged they had fished all night and not caught a fish they not caught a fish Peter was not in a good mood Peter had been a fisherman and been quite good at it amen and Jesus Walks down and says have you any fish now Peter wants to give him a sermon he's upset this is the way he makes a living he's taking time out hadn't done any good whatsoever and here's the Messiah making fun of him have you have you how many fish have you you got amen he don't have nothing to show for it now he's going to he's going to show a disciple that needs to be converted am I'm in control of nature have you heard about a prophet with fleas and flies and water to blood that was me and him amen now I want to show you that's God in me amen cast your nets on the other side brother cbze can you imagine how he felt I have been in this water all night not one fish now he's asking me to take my Nets that are extremely heavy and extremely bulky and to switch it from one side of of the boat to the other side of the boat now let me ask the critic who put this fish here and how did he know that they were going to be there that's who we're dealing with is our God and if God is your partner you better have big plans Teddy you know what they did finally with some convention they throwed their Nets on the other side and being fisherman they could understand the pull of the ropes in the net and they know now within seconds we don't have a boat big enough Hall open the windows of heaven and let him pour out a blessing on you oh yeah you don't have a bank account big enough you don't have a boat big enough now listen he's God in the boat that can calm storms but he's God standing on the on the sand brother Ron that's just a coincidence really Peter was quite a fisherman he loved it if you love something you love it you don't have to be convinced your wife can be beautiful she can be all of that in a box of chocolates she might want you to come home say you if you don't get here I'm going to be very disappointed but you might sing that song I'm going to miss her y'all a bunch of carnal people Connie's looking at me like I'm going to get you home and I'm beating you with a stick God you made her help me now and Peter enjoyed the preaching he enjoyed seeing the Miracles but he had a hook in his pocket how many of you ever read that in the scriptures that Peter had a hook in his pocket it ain't there I know some hands went up but it ain't there I'm enjoying this myself but brother brandom said he always had a hook in his pocket said every time he got next to the water how do he know that how do he know Eve's hair was blun how do you know that Abraham was sitting at the at the gate if you see it you see it I learned a long time ago just just take him at his word if an angel walk with him just take him at his word I'm not going to argue with him I'm not going to fuss with him that's why God comes along and blesses us and he said you know every time they got next to next to a body of water he said he would stand there and you can go read the quotes he said he would stand there and while the preaching was going on he put put a hook in the water he enjoyed fishing I'm going miss her I don't know how much luck he had I I really don't know how much luck he had in a meeting sermons going on he's fishing I don't know but Jesus knew oh yeah and they needed to pay their taxes amen you need to pay your taxes go fishing any of you been on a guided hunt or a guided fishing trip any of you did that yeah well I've did a few of those things and I've enjoyed it I've enjoyed it now what a God does is try to get you in an atmosphere or in a spot to where fish are at or dearer at there's not a God in the world can make that fish B your hook I've been guided on hunts in Canada and here brother Kelly and I had so much success killing geese that the guy took us out and had us hunting cranes cranes not figuring knew we would kill anything and we killed a few and we come back he said y'all kill some yeah yeah we kill some amen I never figured y'all do that other people wasn't getting any geese and we were having Incredible Days they'd come back kill two or three and I don't mean to confess this on you but we were getting a load we were so blessed but that's what we prayed for and you know not what ex why not expect to get what you pray for and I've been on with hunting trips to with deer and they can put you in the right spot and they can put you in the right stand and they can do whatever it takes to get the deer to come in hey they just won't come in you can sit there all day long read your phone listen to sermons no dear did you get anything today didn't see nothing they can change stands and do that you know they do their best cuz you're paying money and they want you to succeed cuz you're paying money and they want you to come back next year you get what I'm saying generally you pay pretty good money and they're generally nice guys but there's not a GU like God now Peter here's what I want you to do I want you to go drop your hook in the water and when you drop your hook in the water you're going to catch a fish and inside that fish's mouth is going to be coins and you pull it out and you're going to be enough money in that fish's mouth for you to go be able to pay your taxes right has anybody ever had a experience like that now there was a sister you may have heard this testimony there was a sister that was con constantly going to church she was constantly going to church and her husband hated her going to church absolutely hated her going to church tried to stop her in every way that she could so he took her keys to her car and threw it in the ocean he thought that was it and she got on her knees and she prayed God you know I want to go to church she goes to the fish market are you following me now and she picks a fish and when she cuts it open there's her [Applause] keys I had an experience this week and that's what caused me me to put that in the notes am I lost my keys this week I searched my coat I searched my pants I searched everywhere that I had been we had been here to church to do some things during the week Matthew Matthew and Adam and myself and we'd been here and we had to get some things taken care
