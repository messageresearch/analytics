have to do this we hate this horrible disease we hate the things that have happened but we don't want any other of our members to contact this disease it's not fear it's wisdom it's the leadership of the lord that we're that we're leading here that we're following and and so as you've heard we've had two funerals we've got two funerals coming up this week and both had been contacted by the disease and and so we just want to we want to be wise in these situations and we don't want to fear this thing but we want to respect it and realize that there's an enemy that is out for us and i don't know about you but i'm looking forward to today's service i come expecting this morning early this morning i just i felt like jesus was on his way to speak to us and we just want to prepare our hearts this morning as we get ready to turn it over to our pastor let's just sing that song the power of your love why don't you invite him right where you are this this morning in your home your family sitting

touched me and he made me a bless you can be seated for a moment so good to have our friends with us this day thank you for coming amen amen we while these are different times you know i was thinking this morning as we were preparing to come to service and we we greet you all in the name of the lord but i i was thinking about the conditions that were under now it seemed like when it was in china it was a long way away and seeing the video of how the doctors were handling it there and the dreaded disease and then it swept in europe and it was happening there and you know it seemed like such a long way away but now our churches are sitting basically empty and we have skeleton crews and we've been doing this now for seem like often on months and uh now it's here and you deal with it and and you just know then it strikes one family after another family and and you know we're not exempt from having problems or sicknesses or even as congregations uh we're not the only body of believers that is having this every church whether denominational whatever they are they're facing the same issues governments are facing it uh sports world is facing it coliseum's set empty because of something they can't see as a church world we look at it and sometimes we look at things just a little bit differently and we're not careful there's a fear that comes with it we realize that this is a a horrible horrible disease that has struck us and there's no vaccine for it and i just i just came through it myself and sister connie just came through it um two weeks of double pneumonia and my both lungs and and i went to the hospital they treated me like royalty there and i appreciated that sister uh crystal was there at the same time and she had been sitting there for about three or three hours and and uh kind of waiting her turn and i came in and sat down beside of her and you would have thought jesus sat down beside of her and so she was just seemed lonely seemed a little bit anxious about it all and and i sat down with her for a moment and they called her and within two minutes they call me and of course of course i i go dress like i'm a preacher and so they they came and got me real quickly and took me back in the room and they said you just can't be sitting out there with all those other people with your condition and so and i said well you guys treat me like royalty and they said you are and so i was appreciative to that i thank you for your prayers through that season of time there was a few nights that i didn't think i was going to make it i still am i'm on the monitoring system for uva and so they call me about every day and i appreciate that we'll continue to pray for sister katie's family and also brother larry medes's family that god would be with them in a special way that god would touch them and larry was a friend of this church sister katie had been here for a couple years and she was in her late 80s and and this morning i was looking at some of her younger pictures and and i'm pretty sure i remember her as a younger woman and we want to we want to just pray for that family we want to give them all the strength that we can today also brother larry will be deeply missed but what a better place to be in the arms of jesus and we just we look at that and we just see that god just watched over him through his life and protected him he worked we worked with brother out in here in in in in many many for many years and and uh good guy good guy we hunted many of us hunted with him he was a great provider for the meadows home he'd be deeply missed but i believe that there's a land beyond the river a great god of mercy that takes care of things and and we just thank the lord for that amen just as a report for you i had two cancer appointments actually many more than that but cancer appointments this week and and sometimes they just scratch their heads and say wow we don't even know and so and so i i just we just chuckled sister connie and i just kind of chuckled just before i was going into the appointment we saw on facebook if somebody already had the results of my appointments before i even walked in and so i let me let me just give you the straight of it i i take treatments every day and that is uh basically uh immunotherapy treatments i take eight pills a day and cancers in my lungs and in my brains and in my lymph nodes and they're fighting them and they they're changing they're doing some different transformations of the cancer it's kind of moving a bit we're believing they're leaving our body i don't know i asked the other day i asked one of the doctors the other day and i said well when will i not be stage four and she said you'll be stage four until the day that you go home and so and so my other doctor says it like this whose report do you believe and so we believe that report and we just trusted him i i appreciate your prayers i i did get some i did get an awesome news yesterday that my eyes are are getting better uh they don't think i'll ever be able to drive but you know brother tim nunnwaller actually sent me a note yesterday that made me so happy i actually shared it with a lot of people thank you brother tim he said great people he said the uppity ups get to be chauffeured he said so brother ron you made the uppity up class and so i don't know so much about that but uh as long as i get to eat doughnuts the rest of my life i'll be all right and so i thank you for praying for me yesterday we i had i was very very sick and and i didn't know if i'd be able to make it here this morning but god by his grace rich in mercy he he brought that to us and i don't have anything that i'll be honest with you i don't have anything that's contagious today but unless you're taking same medicine i am so but i was uh yeah sometimes you take medicine and and it reacts one way someday you take it another day and it you can take it for two or three weeks and it and it does you okay and then all of a sudden you have a really bad day but you know you just the good days outweigh the bad days and so i'm thankful to be able to stand here and to to all the audiences to whomever i'm speaking to this morning and just tell you that i love you with all of my heart and i greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ and god by his grace and mercy will watch over our lives and and for many of you that are suffering even what i am suffering and and even worse we just pray for you sister erica sister susan and just to roll off some names real quick brother aaron we love him with all of our hearts and and we just pray that god would just raise him back up in a special way sorry for a few moments of there but i but i want to share a few things on my heart this morning maybe you could stand just where you're at and amen god bless you first john chapter 1 and verse 1. and i want to just take a thought this morning and i won't get done because of of the times constraints but and even my own energy but i want to speak to you who is jesus and i want to ask a question who are you and i really want to ask that question who are you and i want you to answer that question in your mind now because i was asked the other day who is ron spencer and then it was asked who is ron spencer and then it was asked to me again who is ron spencer so i think it's a good a good thought this morning i'd like for you to you to answer this in your mind who are you who are you really who are you not because somebody else says it but who are you really who are you really who are you really not what the internet says about you but really who are you in another realm they know who you are and i want to say this in another realm that has no time orientation to it they know who you are and you're only stepped out of that little hickey by the time you use that little little hickey of time he said you stepped out of eternity into time and he said you'll step back into eternity amen first john 1 1. that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father was manifested unto us that which we have seen and declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth if we say that we believe the word and we live a different way we're literally living in a lie but if we walk in the light as he is as the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin you may be seated this morning the best way i would think this morning to to begin to think of this as brother branham would stand in prayer lines with people and people would come and maybe come for many many hours we mentioned the other day 17 hours and they would get a prayer card brother billy paul was one of the ones that would give prayer cards and people would wait in long lines to get a prayer card they would put their name down and their condition down and and they they put it down and and they'd hold that prayer card and it would have a number or a letter on it and they might sit in those meetings and actually get there for many hours and and they would get the card and then finally they would get called and so they'd hold their card and of course there wasn't no duplicates of those cards or anything like that nothing nothing would go on and and so they would they would get their name called or they would get their their number called for the card and they would come line up you would hear brother branham sometimes spend 20 minutes getting the prayer line lined up and he would just kind of start he would ask he wouldn't even know where they what numbers were there or what letters were there and he would just kind of impromptu ask what number and maybe if your number got called and you'd have and you would come and you'd saw the miracles before or heard all the miracles and now you've came all of this distance and now you're standing before the prophet of the lord now maybe you've been prayed for by many other people and that's all right but now you're standing with cancer and you know this cancer is going to eat your body up and and it's going to and and it's just it's doing a process because it's got a process to do but you've came before someone that is said to have an angel of the lord with them and the pillar of fire has been sinning the meetings and and there's a there's a presence about this building all of a sudden maybe before there was a a different kind of an uh meeting that now but something about a branham meeting was different because of the atmosphere was so different in the building people said that even which would not be able to get in that said that you could stand hundreds of feet away from the building and it was like a wave after a wave after a wave that would go and you'd stand and one brother told me he said me and my my wife we would stand in our hands held and and he said we would stand and it would hit us wave after wave and he said we were kids and we didn't get the opportunity to be in the meetings but we just stood there and it would just wave after wave of the glory of god and he said i'll tell you brother ron it changed my life there's still real dedicated christians today and i'd say that holds true and so maybe maybe if i could just put myself there and stand just for a moment just on the platform and brother branham starts calling my name he begins to talk to me about my father my mother and just kind of go with me here just for a few minutes and he begins to talk to me about my name maybe even tells me where i live and i've never met you before that would be true and i i see you're a preacher yes and i i your name is ronald dean your mother called you that yes that's right and they found cancer in your lungs and in your lymph nodes in your brain yes that's that's very true i see darkness and it's leaving your body understand what i just did it's leaving your body because that's what's happening you see that darkness has had a grip on this body for about a year but it'll leave this body it'll leave this body because light darkness can't dwell where light's at there's so much light that is in this body that darkness the cells of cancer and the amusements of even doctors just going i don't know i just don't know they call me a very complicated case i just don't know i'll tell you why there's another physician that's on the land [Applause] there's another doctor that's at work hallelujah and he told me if that i would trust him he'd use me like never before and my determination has always been to trust him no matter how sick no matter how dark no matter what the avenue looks like no matter what this is said to me i have trusted him now mr spencer go home and be well in the name of jesus christ [Applause] you say brother ron that was a little silly i you took yourself and put you in a brother branham's meeting okay okay let me be silly one more time there was a woman that didn't know who she was really didn't know because so many people say well i know jesus and they don't know him then they'll go well i know that pastor in the area they really don't know him you don't know him like jesus does and this woman was named sarah and she was sitting in a tent she'd had an upset day and abraham always had a lot of visitors because he's the richest man in the area and he had great advice and he was fellowshipping with another realm and nobody could explain it he would talk about it and people were associated with it and they loved abram but they really they couldn't explain what was going on he got rich but yet you couldn't explain it because he was almost a nomad he was he was blessed everything that he did was blessed anybody kept testifying i'm going to have a son out of these loins it's going to come nations you know there are things that we can't explain but we just know and god had made it known to him that he was going to be the father of nations and and you know sometimes when you tell people i'm going in a rapture and we're a part of a bride there's things that you just can't explain well i want to know everything that there is about the message and i want to know everything that there is about the bible you know just believe it just come to fall in love with jesus like never before you can't sit down and get a theological degree of the serpent seed or the godhead or the seals or the trumpets or any of those things or how god makes himself known but if you fall in love with jesus it'll transform your life like never before if your children come into the atmosphere of jesus christ you won't have to make them serve the lord you won't have to be so worried about it you look at my family that is surrounding me today i've never made them serve god i've never been a legalistic man around them but i've always had an atmosphere fall in love with jesus are you with me now my children are having children and i'm so proud of them but that same jesus that lived in my home can live in your home not just my family but the families of this church the families around the world it's an atmosphere sarah was sitting there because she hadn't realized that she was a part of a promise you see when god was changing abraham's name he was changing hers because she was part of him when god was saying i'm going to have a covenant with you abraham he was also having a covenant with sarah she wasn't there but she was there when god stepped into a body and came to abraham's tent and he sat there with them unseemably of just another normal day sarah really didn't know who abram was i hope you catch that you know you can be married to somebody for years and really not know who they are don't tell me divorce court set full of it are you with me did sister branham really know who brother branham was did his children really know who their father was did sister connie that stood at a church much like this a few years ago did she really know who ron spencer was i'd say not she knew the ron spencer that was in that spot young silly boy and then we would go to work and we would begin to evolve and we would begin to go into life and we'd work double jobs we'd build the companies together and and we we'd have good times bad times through that and then god would just begin to move us to a higher order you've been faithful in a few things i'll make you faithful and then we begin to preach here and all over the world you know i never had to because i'm nothing only only to let people know more about jesus that's all my whole care was about was to get jesus to everyone let me just say this to you if i could have stepped behind of a clow a picture or a behind of a curtain and not operated i would have did it but you see god had to use the man because that's what he does and i could call i could call great men from tim pruitt brother bischo brother donnie all of the ministers around the world and brother nestor i could call i could call from every country almost represented great men literally great men so the world really don't know who they are the real the world don't know who they are but i want to say this to you sometimes you don't realize who you are and that's the real key if you could only treat yourself as how god looks at you it would be completely different you would you're not with some makeshift sacredness or some some phony humility but with a real with a real sincerity and dedication to serve god sarah sitting inside of a tent she didn't realize who she was and she really didn't realize who the man now sitting outside was really didn't realize that you say she did she's married to him she was a half half sister to it she really didn't realize who he was because she laughed at what he was telling her she's getting she's getting she's getting aging now she wanted she didn't want none of those things that would produce agile she couldn't believe the vision for herself so therefore she didn't realize who she was abraham was testifying but she wasn't and so abraham meets this man and calls him lord sarah doesn't come out and greet him the way two angels with him and they discuss business the business of a world falling apart we could have some of those discussions today america's fallen apart in a lot of ways don't get don't get too tore up about that it's supposed to happen oh i want to fix politics and i'm a democrat or i'm a republican don't matter they're all rotten well brother ron i'm i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that and and it's going to be this way and i'm going to turn the world upside down with prayer it's going to fall apart there's a prophet stood here not long ago in what you call eternal time just only seconds ago that said america is doomed america is going to fall apart so you're not going to hear from this pulpit there's going to be another revival in america we heard a prophet and you see abraham was sitting there and they talked about sodom and gomorrah and abraham actually negotiated if there could be 50 there could that city be saved think about that of all of the vast humanity that was there there's a man on a hill near a tent and his wife is going to get a revelation and they're negotiating about two cities that is full of people full of sin but these people have lived as though that's not even going on and now today they're negotiating where the fire will fall and destroy those two cities don't forget how powerful that you are because the same man that said at the tempt has brought a message to you are you are you with me and many times night after night you would hear identified christ of all ages shalom are you with me this same christ is among you even now now you hear it in your pastors and you hear it in the evangelists standing in your local pulpits that saying god that was sitting at the tent is with us even now covid there's been a lot worse things than covet there's been a lot worse plagues than covet this is a tribulation period brother on we've got close to it but this is not the tribulation period this is only signs that's coming but the same melchizedek the same jesus is among us now to tell us who we are the visit would call out her name and he would speak to her where's sarah he knew where she was or sarah why she's in the tent door behind you why did she laugh why did she laugh i didn't laugh i didn't laugh she said brother brown said god could have killed her but she was part of the promise sometimes our attitude has been and don't don't get angelic sometimes our attitude has been wrong even in times like this sometimes our faith gets shaken will we ever go back to church again will we ever have services again will we ever ever listen this message will hold no matter what storm the message will hold reading an article the other day will our government hold through covet will the national football league hold through covenant will restaurants haul through covenant through to covet and i thought to myself i'll tell you something that'll hold i'll tell you something a little this message will hold true are you with me now i could talk for a while on their visit but whether you know it you've been sitting in that same atmosphere for some of you decades and it has been it's been more than just evolving you that's that's a nice word but it's been transforming you and preparing you for rapture about a week about a week ago i see visions other men see dreams and how that i know that they are our atmosphere the atmosphere or the voice in a vision and i know it's god i just feel to share this with you and it's appropriate time because we're empty as we are and i actually wrestle with should i share it should i not share it should i share it should i not share it and i i talked to a very close friend of mine here and then then i shared it with brother tim pruitt and he felt i should share it as well and i was up early in the morning and i found myself going through buildings i i don't know i don't know let me just start it like this how many's ever went through the biltmore and not just hands here but hands all over but the biltmore is the largest uh privately held uh residence in america it's a monstrous house it was a man that incorporated and it was part of the vanderbilt family and they just had unlimited money and and uh until it ran out and they actually employed more people than anybody else in north carolina and that in north carolina through those years of building actually built a railroad just to get the materials to to this house and one of the as you walk as you go through the building it's just it's beyond your imagination of what a building a house would be like for those days and and you walk through and you just kind of grasp the glory of what it must have been like to live in that house or even work in that house just to work in that house was quite a wonderful thing or or to be a gardener or to be a farmer on the property that's probably where i would have liked to been to being a farmer on the property and you know he would tour the property the owner would tour it or he would be overseas and and to give you an idea he was a world traveler and he was scheduled to be on the titanic but because he had no patience he got another ship to take him to america on a trip that he had some supplies to come to the house or he would have been on the titanic himself i'm not even going to go there but but but you see god has predestinated moments for everything and i i've been through the house on a few occasions and actually we have stayed on the grounds on an anniversary and it was it's a nice place to be at but you think the glory of that building was almost 100 years ago and after it's finished he gets to live in it about 19 years and as i was just evolving in these thoughts this week i said andrew i said this man lived in this great vast beautiful home with servants and he had big dogs and they they would sit on the porch and that was his favorite place to set was on the porch and he and he only got to live there 19 years you think about 19 years it's nothing that says absolutely nothing but now tours goes through there every day by the thousands of people they tour and they get to look back in a glimpse of another life though we're in 2020 you just can be transported back to the early 1900s and you kind of just feel the atmosphere of what it must have been like there how they must have conducted things so now i just give you a little setting for a vision so now i'm touring buildings and i'm watching i'm watching as the vision is going and i'm touring buildings and it seems like there's a little little group that is that is going through these buildings and you know as i become to realize that these buildings had now been vacant for a couple of years and they're just being opened up and we're touring through the building and you know if you close a building up and the air conditions is not working and there becomes spider webs and dust and it gets a smell to it and it gets that vacant feeling it don't stay beautiful and clean and fresh as i begin to tour these buildings i i as i toured one after another and it would just seem like in a vision i i can't explain it to you seemed like a long time but it's probably just seconds and i just i just begun to go from one place to another i noticed how that the the the the cobwebs were hanging and and the and the guide that was taking these people through these people were very curious about what happened here and they went and and i began to notice and i noticed one after another building and only in hindsight would i recognize of what i've been involved in and then i then i'm in this one building and i'm kind of standing in a in a place in the back of the building kind of looking down and watching the people come under me and as they're coming under me there's a man standing and he's a bearded man he reminds me of what peter must have been like and so these people begin to ask said we've toured these buildings and some are smaller some are bigger what happened here what happened here why are these buildings like they are what happened here and this man speaks and he says these are the buildings to which that a people once inhabited but they were raptured and they were gone immediately and i recognized i was in temperate building at that spot and then in hindsight i would remember being in a man named jason jackson's building and it just flipped through of this churches that i had been in and now they're vacant and this building vacant this building the cobwebs i'll be honest with you when i came out of that i thought i was being raptured the atmosphere of that i was thinking we're getting ready to go home because now this past present future the blending of time these buildings will set empty oh sure some of them will be used for storehouses we could care less are you with me but here we sit in it and and we've had glorious meetings in it now i'm going to gather my thoughts and i'm going to finish we've had glorious meetings in it like branham meetings to which that people would come for a couple of hours before and set to hear the word of god we've had the dead raised here we've had cancer healed here we've had some of the worst sin cases healed here and cured here and became real citizens of the kingdom of god and when this place sets full of two to three hundred people of our normal people we sit here and the presence of god echoes across this building i'm sure you could turn the lights on but that don't create an atmosphere you can turn the heating air on but that don't create an atmosphere but you let one son of god somebody help me preach you let one son of god walk into the building with an expectation to meet god on these grounds come on church and we walk in and we take our spot and we prepare to worship the lord hallelujah you may be at home you may be watching this service you may archive these services but i want you to know what you're experiencing now is only temporary i don't know if we'll return to the great mass meetings that we've had but i will tell you this there's coming a rapture there's coming a rapture the abraham and sarah that set at that tent in only a matter of days weeks months they had a body change can i reach and just grab it just for a moment what if you were their neighbor and you heard the testimonies of before andrew can you set a chair here for me real quickly set two chairs i'm gonna go ahead and get comfortable okay here can sit here with me i'll tell you andrew i met him i met him the other night something pulled me out of the tent i went up on the hill i got by that special place he called my name he told me i'll be your shield and i'll be your buckler i heard his voice i i i know i can't explain it i heard his voice i'm gonna make a covenant between me and thee and i'm gonna bless you everything you see i'm gonna give it to you abraham i'm gonna give you children i'll tell you andrew i can't explain what he looks like sometimes he comes like a pillar of fire sometimes i just hear his voice i cut the beast up and he comes and consumes the beast i'll tell you i thought i knew who abraham was but when god told me who abraham was i'll tell you andrew you've been my neighbor you've been a great neighbor through these years you've been a great boy but i tell you i'm gonna have a son i know i'm getting old but i'm gonna have a son the other day he was at the tent and he was a man what the voice was was a man and i'll tell you when i looked into his deep set eyes it looked like he was looking right straight through me you may not believe this but this this body is going to have a son i'm gonna i'm gonna have a son and sarah i'm gonna have it by sarah she don't believe it but i'll tell you andrew the other day when he revealed the secret of her heart she changed in just a second she changed i've been working on her for decades but in a second her atmosphere was just it was just so different andrew i tell you it's like living with a different wife let's fast forward just a little bit and you move with me it's me it's me i'm abraham i know you can't really believe it but i'm the same one that met him on the hill and i'm the same one that met him at the tent and you knew me as an old man and gray-haired and beard and my body was deteriorating but i'll tell you what he told me is taking place in my body just waited you see sarah that's what i'm talking about just wait till you see her this message is working can i fast forward just a little bit come here isaac come here buddy he sat down and you're looking at him you're grey-headed now you're old age now but abraham's younger than you now and isaac's jumped up on his knee and he's kissing him and wrestling him around you see what was a vision now's reality i want to tell you andrew many years ago your grandfather and i saw that you were a preacher there's a lot of people got jealous that we we saw you as a preacher and they got mad and some have been left because they couldn't see what we saw now i'm preaching now now i've came to the end of my sermon and i'm preaching so that which was prophetic which was in the future then become real and came into time oh yeah you were a silly boy you were a real silly boy i tried to get the silliness out of you but after a while i figured it was going to stay forever but that's what made you special and one day jesus came into your life it was kind of like sarah when she actually figured out who she was she became a part of the promise now andrew i'm not just talking to you i'm talking to all of these pews sitting here when people figure out who they are at that same melchizedek that same jesus has talked to them all of these years and it becomes so real until they realize it wasn't about me it was all about him and all we had jobs and we had homes and we had cars and we had we had good times and we had bad times now andrew what other people couldn't see god already saw in another dimension they already see things that we can't see because time has been taken away and everything is known as god knows so they know you for who you really are you don't have to convince them you don't have to tell them i'm the great andrew spencer because it's not we're not the ones that's great it's he's great that's right you see if you put your finger in a bucket of water and pull it out and figure out where the hole is well that's just about how important we are but the one that's important is jesus amen andrew i don't know when i don't know what days it'll be but just like abraham talked to his neighbor andrew one day they walked into the tent oh creaking and the next day they walked out that's right one day we're walking to this church there'll be good atmosphere here and bad atmosphere there'll be people that want to be here and then there'll be people that don't want to be here you know you now andrew worry about goats they'll always be goats you know and don't spend don't spend all your time on worrying about goats that really don't want to be here you just preach to sheep and you see sheep's going to take a rapture goats are going to stay they'll quit they'll be glad they're actually glad covet came i'm having too much good but this is true but i'm going to tell you andrew you just keep preaching what this word says and regardless of the circumstances around it past present future we could look back two years after the rapture happens and see the cobwebs in this building but you see there was a time for us to be here and then there's a time for us to be there there was a time that had iraq prayed for her boys and there was a time that she just knew they're okay i just thank the lord for it sister connie there's a time that ron spencer wrestled in the night with this cancer threw up through the day got weak had to have naps that probably won't finish but there will be a time to where ron spencer will be 100 percent healed [Applause] i know there's probably only 10 or 12 15 of us here we really don't have a number difference the health department's really thrilled with how we're handling things and we thank the lord for that but but let me just say this to you whatever you do in life don't miss seeing who jesus is and if i could take it just a little bit higher whatever you do in life don't miss seeing who you are because let me say this to you you can waste a whole lot of time spinning a whole lot of wheels trying to live somebody else's life for them or you can fall in love with jesus fall in love with this word this message and that's what this message is is jesus not brother branham no no no but but jesus she fall in love with him and that atmosphere that atmosphere that was there with an infidel on a porch right you notice brother branham didn't get him to try to fall in love with him he got him to fall in love with jesus yeah what about burke call yeah brother brown said oh lizard dies meanest man i ever met right brother ron but that's brother branham what about a naked man on a boat cursing and this guy standing over here that's homeless tells him cast your net on the other side i've been tolling all night long just cast your net on the other side when he really met who jesus was his concern was not fishing anymore his concern was being with that man that spoke to his heart and there was something about his voice that was greater than anything he ever heard in his life sure seeing the withered hands being restored the eyes being healed and the dead being raised and rolling the stones away and watching the fish be duplicated but now jesus is asking him to go to the upper room and he'll share the testimony of who jesus really was not some man's imagination but who jesus really was you might share it in walmart you might share it in kroger's you might share it at your salon wherever you go you might share it on your job you might share it where we're maybe in a barber chair and all of a sudden a warm presence comes by that same jesus i'd like for that same jesus to live in our lives you might criticize me for telling a vision today but you see it was that kind of presence that it's here right now that's right you see i don't have to lie for no man i don't have to embellish i would share this with brother tim pruitt and brother tim would say you know when we first built our building he said may this building be a memorial for people they passed by to see there was a bride that was here may this building be that kind of a building that this building would be built on this hill and i i don't care what's done with it after we leave but you know i'd like to say that maybe people would go by with a reverence i know people that once lived on the earth they're gone now i don't know or some hooky spooks about it but they're gone now they're gone they believe some sort of a message but they're gone now what about your home past present future your name is ron spencer you had cancer it's gone now it's gone now hallelujah brother ron i'd like to stood in the meetings with brother branham that same lord jesus is here amen and he's in your living room he's in your home yes he's with you brother jason he's with you brother damn and he's there he's there hallelujah andrew i'm not the singer i'm not the preacher compared to you either but could we sing a song together this might be a strange setting we'll sing a song together here and then we'll dismiss i wish you could feel what we feel here i only wish you could feel what we feel here amen it's a strange way i've never ended a service quite like this but brother sister anna this has been pretty nice hadn't it yeah do you feel like sarah sitting in a tent for a little while yeah she'll look out and say i'm sitting yeah if he turned his head just right you could see his eyes and when you saw his eyes you know it was him you've never made me before but there's just something about him that's the one abraham's been talking about good to see the tears in the eyes won't you sing a dismissal song for his hand real worship maybe something slow and sacred [Music] take these hands [Music] for i have no strength [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i have nothing i have nothing without you will take my voice and pour it out let it sing a song's mercy i have failed i have nothing i have nothing [Music] my soul is all your love [Music] to cover me they will see that i [Music] oh take

just let it rain open the floodgates of heaven just let it rain hallelujah hallelujah god bless you where you are today we trust that you can feel the same atmosphere that is in this building that you have been touched by the atmosphere of the holy spirit that is here and is working facing things that we've never faced before and even though we can't see him working he's still working even though we can't see him moving he's still moving i trust that you've had an interview with melchizedek today treasure these things treasure these moments for these are the true sayings of god if there ever was a time it's a time for the redeemed of the lord to say so god bless you today as you're dismissed as we sing that song our god is an awesome god he reigns from heaven and earth our god is an awesome god [Music] our god is an awesome god
