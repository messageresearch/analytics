[55:25] preaching amen
[55:27] but we do appreciate brother Ron Spencer
[55:31] and
[55:32] you know he's always he's been a great
[55:35] blessing to the bride
[55:37] around the world
[55:40] and lots of times people look at
[55:43] preachers as
[55:45] well they've got it easy
[55:47] and you know
[55:49] as if they don't have any problems
[55:53] but your pastor here has has exhibited
[55:57] over and over
[56:00] the faith and the Deep confidence that
[56:02] he has in the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:05] and we appreciate men like that that
[56:08] amen that can fight behind the pulpit
[56:10] and then fight at home too
[56:12] can you say Amen
[56:14] and so we we mightily appreciate our
[56:19] brother and we appreciate brother Andrew
[56:20] brother Andrew come and preach for us uh
[56:23] uh preach for you at our youth camp last
[56:25] year and done a tremendous job and and
[56:29] um and so we we just greatly uh we just
[56:33] feel like it's a real honor to be here
[56:35] behind this Pulpit here this evening I
[56:38] trust that I can say something a man
[56:40] that will be a blessing to you and
[56:43] um so let's look here in Genesis the
[56:46] 18th chapter we're going to read the
[56:48] first six verses
[56:50] and the Lord appeared unto him in the
[56:52] plains of memory and he set
[56:55] in the tent Door In the Heat of the day
[56:58] and he lifted up his eyes and looked and
[57:01] lo three men stood by him
[57:04] and when he saw them he ran to meet them
[57:07] from the tent door I want you to notice
[57:10] that he ran to meet them from the tent
[57:14] door
[57:15] and bowed himself toward the ground
[57:19] and said Lord if now I have found favor
[57:22] in thy sight pass not away I pray thee
[57:26] from thy servant let a little water I
[57:29] pray you be fetched and wash your feet
[57:32] and rest yourselves under the tree and I
[57:35] will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort
[57:38] ye your hearts
[57:40] after that ye had after ye uh shall pass
[57:43] on for therefore are ye come to your
[57:47] servant and they said so do and do as
[57:51] thou has said and Abraham hastened into
[57:55] the tent unto Sarah and said make ready
[57:58] quickly three measures of fine meal and
[58:01] kneel it are needed and make breads up
[58:05] on the earth I want you to notice here
[58:08] the intensity the brother that Abraham
[58:10] has toward the angel of the Lord
[58:13] he is entertaining the angel of the Lord
[58:16] and I want to preach here tonight when
[58:18] entertaining the angel of the Lord
[58:21] entertain means to give attention to it
[58:24] means to nurture
[58:26] it means to receive someone it means to
[58:29] cling to
[58:31] and the scripture says in the as it was
[58:33] in the days of Sodom
[58:36] so shall it be in the revealing of the
[58:38] son of man there's going to be a
[58:39] revealing and there's going to be a
[58:41] receiving
[58:43] let's go to the Lord in prayer father we
[58:45] want to thank you tonight for your
[58:47] blessings
[58:48] how wonderful it is to be in the house
[58:50] of the Lord
[58:52] and father it's a privilege
[58:55] to stand here
[58:57] to minister to this group
[59:00] right here in Virginia
[59:03] and I pray Lord that you would bless
[59:06] them bless their pastor Lord bless
[59:09] sister Connie Lord and all of the
[59:11] laborers here in the church
[59:14] I pray Lord that your blessings would be
[59:16] upon this service that it would be upon
[59:19] your word tonight
[59:20] I pray Lord that you would anoint your
[59:22] servant
[59:24] father I I just ask that you would just
[59:27] step up behind the platform now and that
[59:30] you would Minister to the people is my
[59:33] prayer we love you father and we're so
[59:36] thankful for your grace in our lives
[59:38] in the name of Jesus we pray
[59:41] can the Church Say Amen
[59:44] and amen God bless you you may be seated
[59:47] here tonight
[59:51] I want to speak on entertaining
[59:54] the angel of the Lord
[59:57] as it was in the days of Sodom I think
[1:00:01] we can pretty well attest that amen
[1:00:05] we're living in those days
[1:00:07] we it's a day of absolute
[1:00:10] self-gratification
[1:00:12] it was a day when every man done that
[1:00:16] which was right in his own eyes
[1:00:19] until there were absolutely no
[1:00:22] boundaries
[1:00:23] there there was no boundaries to sin it
[1:00:28] was a discovering of their sexuality
[1:00:32] it was a day of homosexuality uh
[1:00:36] children born gender neutral
[1:00:40] Madness as long as they wanted it they
[1:00:44] got it
[1:00:45] Sodom was a a day of great perversion
[1:00:51] Iman there was no questioning of the of
[1:00:54] the belief system you see lot's senses
[1:00:57] had literally become so numbed I I want
[1:01:01] you to think about that until he become
[1:01:04] accustomed to this new Norm
[1:01:08] becomes so accustomed until he could rub
[1:01:12] shoulders with the sodomites and really
[1:01:16] think oh surely surely God you know
[1:01:19] looks on the heart and and the people
[1:01:23] are loving God in their own way and and
[1:01:26] and maybe he was attending his own a
[1:01:30] church every Sunday morning because you
[1:01:33] see these sodomites were avid worshipers
[1:01:37] amen they they amen their worship wasn't
[1:01:40] as strict as Abraham's of course but but
[1:01:42] they believed full-heartedly that God
[1:01:46] would accept them in their worship no
[1:01:50] matter what they were they were all
[1:01:54] covered because they were worshipers
[1:01:57] well can you say Amen
[1:01:59] and lot didn't have enough get up in him
[1:02:01] to stand out he couldn't stand out so he
[1:02:04] Blended in now I want to set the stage
[1:02:07] for what this Mighty Angel A man was
[1:02:11] coming into can you say amen that's for
[1:02:14] Abraham's way of seeing things lot
[1:02:16] simply could not see it he was blinded
[1:02:19] to the fact that Sodom was fixing to
[1:02:21] burn he was blinded to the fact amen
[1:02:23] that he himself had had fallen so far
[1:02:27] behind he was blinded to the fact that
[1:02:30] God was fulfilling his promise to
[1:02:33] Abraham
[1:02:34] can you say mine
[1:02:36] they're in Romans 1 and 21 this is
[1:02:38] because that when they knew God they
[1:02:40] glorified him not as God neither were
[1:02:43] thankful but became vain in their
[1:02:46] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[1:02:48] darkened professing themselves to be
[1:02:52] wise they became fools
[1:02:54] well praise the Lord I I think that
[1:02:57] pretty well tells us where we're at
[1:02:58] today
[1:03:00] amen you you you you can't find anybody
[1:03:04] amen hardly in the in the secular world

[1:09:00] church service and not entertain his
[1:09:03] presence you should never stand in a
[1:09:05] Bible study and not entertain his
[1:09:07] presence
[1:09:10] amen we got you can come in here and sit
[1:09:12] on the church all you want to keep your
[1:09:14] hands all folded amen and step there and
[1:09:17] wait for the preacher to move you but I
[1:09:19] want to tell you God is here if you can
[1:09:22] recognize him
[1:09:25] Hallelujah he's still a Healer he's
[1:09:29] still a deliverer he's still a baptizer
[1:09:31] he's still a filler with a holy ghost
[1:09:34] entertaining his presence
[1:09:37] [Applause]
[1:09:40] oh Hallelujah
[1:09:42] come on now
[1:09:46] you can't entertain him
[1:09:48] as long as you're sneaking around with
[1:09:50] those little mini skirts and
[1:09:53] you can't entertain him with skinny
[1:09:55] jeans on
[1:09:57] you can't entertain him as long as
[1:09:59] you're trying to fit in with all the
[1:10:01] weirdo haircuts and well praise the Lord
[1:10:06] amen well I'm a Christian amen Soul was
[1:10:09] lot
[1:10:10] Soul was lot and lot was so blinded to
[1:10:14] what God was doing in that day he was so
[1:10:17] blinded amen that he would have been
[1:10:19] destroyed he would have been destroyed
[1:10:22] by the destroying Angels come on church
[1:10:24] but it was Abraham that God appeared to
[1:10:27] it was the one who was waiting it was
[1:10:30] the one who was seeking it was the one
[1:10:32] who was entertaining his presence
[1:10:40] praise the Lord
[1:10:42] amen
[1:10:44] you see
[1:10:45] brother Branham said now
[1:10:47] look at it bruised wounded tour
[1:10:50] opened up his side with a Roman spear in
[1:10:53] order
[1:10:54] that by the Holy Spirit we could be
[1:10:55] baptized into his body
[1:10:57] partakers of his divine nature you get
[1:11:00] it would you become a partaker after
[1:11:02] coming into his body a partaker of his
[1:11:04] divine nature Christ nature in you how
[1:11:07] can you cheat and steal and lie and
[1:11:10] backslide and proselyte everything else
[1:11:12] with the divine nature of Christ in you
[1:11:14] it is impossible
[1:11:16] so let that soak just a few minutes
[1:11:19] because it's right if you're a partaker
[1:11:23] in Christ then you become a new creature
[1:11:27] and old things have passed away and all
[1:11:31] things have become new can I hear a
[1:11:33] great big amen
[1:11:35] all of our warrings and fussings and
[1:11:38] stewings and arguings and tempers all of
[1:11:41] these things just pass away do you see
[1:11:43] it what is the fruit of the spirit we've
[1:11:46] been we've planted on church membership
[1:11:48] upon shouting upon demonstrations of our
[1:11:51] words but the fruit of the spirit is
[1:11:53] first love love who when you love those
[1:11:57] that are in love alone that's the spirit
[1:11:59] of Christ love joy peace long-suffering
[1:12:02] goodness meekness gentleness patience
[1:12:03] there's the fruit of the spirit so no
[1:12:06] matter how what what church you belong
[1:12:08] to or what you have done now you say now
[1:12:10] brother Branham I tell you I do this and
[1:12:13] I do that I know what what I've got
[1:12:16] because I can pray for the sick and and
[1:12:19] they're healed brother Brianna and God
[1:12:21] just revealed the word to me like this
[1:12:23] and like that and like the other and
[1:12:26] I've got the knowledge of the word he
[1:12:28] says you're absolutely wrong
[1:12:32] oh now that hits us hard
[1:12:38] you're up you're wrong if you're not
[1:12:42] entertaining his presence
[1:12:46] he says I heal the sick and I speak with
[1:12:48] tongues and I do these things and I cast
[1:12:50] out Devils then he'll come to me in that
[1:12:52] day with the same story can you say amen
[1:12:55] amen he says depart from me you workers
[1:12:57] of iniquity I don't even know you he
[1:12:59] says that kind of changes the picture
[1:13:00] doesn't it brother
[1:13:03] Abraham and Sarah
[1:13:05] must I remind you
[1:13:07] must I remind you
[1:13:09] that God has got a specific promise for
[1:13:14] you
[1:13:18] Abraham didn't follow lot out there in
[1:13:21] Sodom
[1:13:22] he had a different revelation
[1:13:24] well I'm fixing to preach here in a
[1:13:26] minute
[1:13:27] but in the revealing of the son of man
[1:13:31] when God is revealed in the form of dust
[1:13:37] when God is here Discerning the hearts
[1:13:41] of the people
[1:13:42] night after night with Precision year
[1:13:45] after year the son of man literally
[1:13:48] restoring the hearts to the faith oh

[1:14:08] that they wanted the discernment they
[1:14:10] wanted these things here but when the
[1:14:12] word came it was the word that was going
[1:14:15] to produce that body change it was it
[1:14:18] was the revealing of the son of man at
[1:14:21] that tent oh come on church amen it's
[1:14:24] not in our emotion and buddy I love
[1:14:26] emotion it's not Amen in our singing and
[1:14:30] I love this singer but it is in the
[1:14:32] Blessed word that has come hallelujah
[1:14:36] amen shall not live by bread alone but
[1:14:39] by every word that proceeds out of the
[1:14:43] mouth of God

[1:14:48] word when your emotions are gone you've
[1:14:50] got the word when you're feeling empty
[1:14:52] you've got the word it's that word
[1:14:57] oh come on Church
[1:14:59] it's that word that'll defeat the Devil
[1:15:01] any time any place under any condition
[1:15:08] whether you feel it it's still there
[1:15:11] whether you're whether you're high on
[1:15:13] the mountain or low in the valley that
[1:15:16] word is still there
[1:15:22] Hallelujah
[1:15:25] though I walk to the valley
[1:15:27] Ron Spitzer the wife walk through the
[1:15:29] valley of the shadow of death

[1:15:42] and that's death

[1:15:50] leading oh Hallelujah
[1:15:53] brother Wendell I'm scared for my life
[1:15:55] right now just keep walking with the
[1:15:57] word
[1:15:59] another window I just don't know what
[1:16:00] the next step is just keep walking with
[1:16:02] the word
[1:16:04] I just don't know how I'm going to
[1:16:06] produce that baby just keep walking with
[1:16:08] the word there's going to come a time
[1:16:10] where you're going to come into Sarah
[1:16:12] and say Sarah the angel is at my door
[1:16:16] the angel the one I met the one who gave
[1:16:19] the promise the one who's never failed
[1:16:21] that God is at my door

[1:16:44] [Applause]
[1:16:50] you say there's only one
[1:16:52] flaw that I have with that analogy
[1:16:54] brother Wendell
[1:16:56] it's been 60 years
[1:16:59] since the prophet was here
[1:17:05] so the angel must have went home with
[1:17:07] him
[1:17:10] the angel of the Lord is still on the
[1:17:12] Earth
[1:17:16] and the last I heard
[1:17:18] that it was the mighty angel
[1:17:21] coming to the Earthly angel
[1:17:25] well praise the Lord
[1:17:27] foreign

[1:18:10] now does the bible say that that the
[1:18:12] mighty angel came with me
[1:18:14] closed book
[1:18:15] or an open book
[1:18:18] huh
[1:18:20] it was closed in Revelations 5 but
[1:18:23] Revelations 10 the mighty Angel is
[1:18:26] descending from heaven with an open book
[1:18:31] you're down here
[1:18:33] Hallelujah
[1:18:37] Hallelujah you weren't expecting much
[1:18:40] anyways Hallelujah
[1:18:42] the mighty angel
[1:18:44] is to come to the Earthly angel
[1:18:49] well praise the Lord
[1:18:51] is that the way the Bible reads
[1:18:53] now is that something brother Branham
[1:18:54] conjured up or is that the way the Bible
[1:18:56] reads it
[1:18:57] the mighty Angel is to come with an open
[1:19:01] book and give it to the Earthly angel
[1:19:04] [Applause]
[1:19:05] all right come on down
[1:19:07] that you hand the book to the Earthly
[1:19:10] angel
[1:19:11] don't close that book
[1:19:14] now you get up there and you start
[1:19:16] preaching
[1:19:22] Point your finger preachers have got to
[1:19:25] point their finger
[1:19:36] [Applause]
[1:19:42] the mighty Angel is very disappointed in
[1:19:45] you right now
[1:19:48] so the mighty Angel has just came to the
[1:19:52] Earthly Angel and the Earthly Angel is
[1:19:56] giving you the book
[1:19:58] [Applause]
[1:20:06] he didn't come to me
[1:20:08] he didn't come to another Andrew he
[1:20:10] didn't come to brother Ron he didn't
[1:20:12] come to brother Josh he came to the
[1:20:15] seventh angel messenger
[1:20:17] [Applause]
[1:20:20] but too many people put it all with the
[1:20:23] seventh angel messenger
[1:20:29] but the seventh angel said my job is to
[1:20:34] declare
[1:20:37] that he is here
[1:20:43] the seventh Angel's job
[1:20:52] is to declare the angel of the Lord is
[1:20:57] here
[1:20:58] [Applause]
[1:21:03] come on now
[1:21:06] but you're gonna miss that angel as long

[1:21:10] going to miss that angel as long as
[1:21:12] you're looking to lay out of sea it's
[1:21:15] time to look into the promises of God
[1:21:18] [Applause]

[1:21:30] amen
[1:21:32] are you hearing me the message can only
[1:21:34] come through the seventh angel
[1:21:38] but the only reason the mighty angel
[1:21:39] came down
[1:21:41] the only reason the Earthly Angel
[1:21:42] proclaimed
[1:21:45] was because this little nobody
[1:21:49] this fellow here
[1:21:51] that no one likes
[1:21:53] not even girls will look at him
[1:21:57] thankfully he's got a mama

[1:23:18] with him comes healing with him comes
[1:23:21] deliverances

[1:25:23] tapes I hear it in the seals I read it

[1:26:03] entertaining or giving you the
[1:26:05] Revelation oh come on church amen it
[1:26:09] still takes the anointing of the holy
[1:26:10] spirit it's not what you hear it's not
[1:26:14] what you read but it's in the anointing
[1:26:16] to reveal that word unto you
[1:26:20] [Applause]
[1:26:22] thank you
[1:26:24] Hallelujah
[1:26:25] can you see man
[1:26:28] lot can't change
[1:26:33] maybe lot read the prophecies
[1:26:37] maybe lot heard the prophecies from
[1:26:39] Abraham telling them while he was in his
[1:26:41] church
[1:26:47] but lot
[1:26:51] did not have the little Walmart barcode
[1:26:56] Hallelujah
[1:26:59] if you go get your item and you take
[1:27:02] your atom and you you run it up there to
[1:27:04] to the cash register and what do they do
[1:27:06] they don't ask you what is this what is
[1:27:08] that no they're scattered across the
[1:27:11] barcode and that scanner tells them
[1:27:14] what it is
[1:27:16] because this product is in this
[1:27:22] that's right
[1:27:25] lot did not waste lot was not in the
[1:27:29] system
[1:27:31] hey man now a lot didn't have the
[1:27:33] slightest idea Oh Glory oh come on
[1:27:35] church but there's an elect here on the
[1:27:38] earth that was in God's mind before the
[1:27:40] foundation of the world and he has
[1:27:42] promised I'm going to come down amen I'm
[1:27:45] going to send Elijah it's going to turn
[1:27:47] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:27:49] fathers and the angel of God is going to
[1:27:51] come down and Empower them with a book
[1:27:54] They're going to be anointed they're not
[1:27:56] going to be an average church member
[1:27:57] they're not just going to sit in a
[1:27:59] church anymore and sing in a choir or
[1:28:02] play in the music but these men would be
[1:28:04] anointed of God to defeat the Devil they
[1:28:07] would be empowered by God to destroy the
[1:28:10] strongholds of the enemy
[1:28:16] it's not a pixie gonna come down and
[1:28:18] wave a magic wand Over You Someday
[1:28:20] you're gonna merge right in to the
[1:28:23] Rapture killing Devils as you go
[1:28:32] can you say man
[1:28:35] can you say Amen
[1:28:36] [Applause]
[1:28:40] so it's not in your knowledge
[1:28:45] that mighty one
[1:28:46] that is Among Us
[1:28:48] how can you say man
[1:28:50] do you realize
[1:28:52] that your friends
[1:28:56] do not have the power within them to
[1:28:59] change themselves
[1:29:01] zebra can't change your stripes no
[1:29:02] matter how much how much you wash them
[1:29:07] what can you say man
[1:29:08] leopards can't change their spots
[1:29:15] and neither could Sarah
[1:29:17] and neither could Abraham
[1:29:20] the only difference
[1:29:22] is one had a barcode from heaven
[1:29:25] and when the angel came by something
[1:29:27] started reading ding ding ding ding ding
[1:29:29] ding ding ding ding
[1:29:31] something started saying he's near
[1:29:33] he's near
[1:29:35] can you say man
[1:29:37] I wonder sometimes about our attitudes
[1:29:39] amen
[1:29:40] Hallelujah but the Bible said Iman that
[1:29:45] before the fire falls
[1:29:47] the son of man was to come to Earth
[1:29:50] and he would be revealed word in flesh
[1:29:54] and as long amen as the word was in
[1:29:58] Melchizedek
[1:29:59] as long as it was in the angel as long
[1:30:02] as the angel came
[1:30:05] and he had the word in him he was the
[1:30:09] only one of power
[1:30:12] so Abraham knew he held the promise
[1:30:17] he's here it's about time for
[1:30:20] fulfillment I'm not gonna let him go
[1:30:27] Abraham never could produce that baby
[1:30:29] Sarah couldn't produce the baby but the
[1:30:31] angel
[1:30:36] [Music]
[1:30:37] right you think that he was just going
[1:30:39] to come and say shake his hand and say
[1:30:40] God bless you I'll see you on the next
[1:30:42] trip
[1:30:46] I'm too tired tonight
[1:30:49] hey I know this service is way too long
[1:30:53] I don't feel like praying this morning
[1:30:55] come on
[1:30:57] when Abraham saw that angel
[1:30:59] Abraham wasn't going to let him go
[1:31:02] oh my oh did did you see all of the amen
[1:31:06] all of the all of the verbs in there
[1:31:09] amen he ran to meet him he bowed himself
[1:31:13] to the ground he cried Lord if I have
[1:31:17] found favor in thy sight pass not away

[1:33:18] to the people
[1:33:20] but once he delivered the word to the
[1:33:23] people
[1:33:25] then the veil could be taken back off of

[1:34:50] it's hidden in the womb of their heart
[1:34:55] wouldn't you have liked to have been a
[1:34:56] fly on the wall that morning

[1:35:06] and he does the Double Take well baby

[1:35:45] the word of the Lord the whole Church of
[1:35:49] the Living God we're fixing to enter
[1:35:51] into a body change we're fixing it
[1:35:53] Hallelujah we've been waiting and we've
[1:35:56] been waiting but the angel has appeared
[1:35:59] in this generation
[1:36:01] he would not have appeared if he did not
[1:36:04] expect to bring you into that body
[1:36:07] change
[1:36:09] [Applause]
[1:36:12] it was no longer in the angel
[1:36:20] it was now

[1:36:33] you were old and ugly while ago
[1:36:38] but now
[1:36:42] there come a change
[1:36:44] the change happened in the countenance
[1:36:46] first
[1:36:47] the change happened in the accepting of
[1:36:51] that word
[1:36:53] and believing it the way the seventh
[1:36:56] angel brought it
[1:37:00] you say you follow the message and you
[1:37:03] ain't doing it the way the brother
[1:37:04] Brandon said to do it you ain't in the
[1:37:06] message
[1:37:09] but when you are taking Hallelujah I can
[1:37:13] tell that you're doing it the way
[1:37:14] brother Brad I'm done it because you're
[1:37:15] at church tonight Hallelujah
[1:37:17] well Glory
[1:37:19] amen but she accepted the words of the
[1:37:25] angel
[1:37:26] long time before the poochie started
[1:37:29] pooching
[1:37:32] I'm not saying you're fixing to have a
[1:37:33] baby I'm not amen
[1:37:43] can you say man
[1:37:45] when the friends did not agree when lot
[1:37:49] did not understand when there was a
[1:37:51] church split over this Revelation like
[1:37:54] went that way and Abraham stood there in
[1:37:57] the desert
[1:37:59] when everything was chaotic they were
[1:38:04] living under a promise I want to tell
[1:38:08] you here tonight you are living under a
[1:38:12] supernatural promise
[1:38:15] [Applause]
[1:38:21] thank you sis
[1:38:23] Hallelujah
[1:38:25] can you say man
[1:38:28] now you say brother one
[1:38:32] that's just a little
[1:38:34] it's a little far-fetched
[1:38:36] I believe those that are entertaining
[1:38:37] the angel of the Lord
[1:38:39] I believe that the world can see it
[1:38:41] [Applause]
[1:38:48] you can't be entertaining God and living
[1:38:51] in sin
[1:38:53] [Applause]
[1:38:56] well you're just saying brother wouldn't
[1:38:57] let us ask for no more no no no no
[1:39:00] I'm here to tell you that there's a
[1:39:02] plenty of Abraham's elect seed that are
[1:39:04] out there in Sodom
[1:39:06] and it's got to be somebody who has news
[1:39:08] the angel the Lord is here that is going
[1:39:11] to lead them to the presence of the Lord
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:15] can you say Amen
[1:39:19] the world had to testify
[1:39:22] oh God
[1:39:23] the sons of men became Tabernacles for
[1:39:29] The Living Word
[1:39:31] the sons of men
[1:39:33] become an expression of the words
[1:39:40] they're not just words on a page that
[1:39:44] you're reading in a message book but
[1:39:47] this is the presence of God to bring to
[1:39:51] pass his word in you
[1:39:55] even the king had to testify that there
[1:39:58] had been a change
[1:39:59] can you say Amen
[1:40:01] it was no longer in Melchizedek it is
[1:40:05] now in
[1:40:07] Sarah
[1:40:10] now
[1:40:12] brother Branham says
[1:40:15] but this is this this is Spirit
[1:40:18] that comes upon the promised word for
[1:40:21] this age
[1:40:22] so you've got the messenger who has come
[1:40:24] anointed and he has preached
[1:40:27] but this is spirit that comes upon the
[1:40:30] promised word for the age brings forth
[1:40:33] and manifests not two tables of stones
[1:40:35] but the presence of the Living God not a
[1:40:39] mythical thought somebody made up or
[1:40:41] some Houdini a trick but the very
[1:40:44] promise of God revealed and made
[1:40:47] manifest right before us and then he
[1:40:49] asked what sort of a veil will that be
[1:40:54] behind
[1:40:58] now you can look there brother on and
[1:41:00] say well I know it's in him I can see it
[1:41:02] you can look at brother Andrew and say I
[1:41:04] I know it's in him I can see it
[1:41:07] you can look at her brother Josh and
[1:41:08] brother Sean preachers around I I can
[1:41:12] see it in them
[1:41:14] but the Bible says where brother Branham
[1:41:16] says in that day Luke 17 20 which is
[1:41:18] actually 17 30. I believe it is Jesus
[1:41:21] said when the son of man is being
[1:41:23] revealed not men the son of man not an
[1:41:26] organization the son of man The Living
[1:41:28] Word the word living itself again among
[1:41:32] the people the word itself made flesh in
[1:41:37] you you are the reflection of this hour
[1:41:40] the message you're the reflection of it
[1:41:47] where glory to God
[1:41:50] even the king had to look and say
[1:41:53] testify that there had been a change
[1:41:59] amen Abraham says hey baby you look too
[1:42:03] you
[1:42:04] you look hot

[1:42:14] and uh
[1:42:16] because he'll kill me for you
[1:42:19] and you think and
[1:42:21] and you think you've got a bad husband
[1:42:31] he

[1:42:38] get through the king king looks out the
[1:42:40] window and he looks down and go oh

[1:43:09] and if it had not been for the
[1:43:12] Angel of the Lord
[1:43:15] if it had not been for the angel of the
[1:43:18] Covenant the one who made the promise to
[1:43:21] Sarah and Abraham at the beginning
[1:43:23] was now here
[1:43:26] going to make sure

[1:43:31] about your promise God's been right
[1:43:33] there with you the whole time keeping
[1:43:34] you the whole way
[1:43:36] God's leading you to your promise
[1:43:40] not now to your promise some of you feel
[1:43:42] like your destiny will never come some
[1:43:44] of you feel like God has totally

[1:43:53] times he puts you those places but he's
[1:43:56] taken you to your destiny the angel of

[1:44:47] can you say Amen
[1:44:49] can you say Amen
[1:44:51] you see God's word made flesh no church
[1:44:57] I say when we look at the intensity of
[1:44:59] God in this generation sin around the
[1:45:01] world seven times when we see the
[1:45:03] intensity of what God has done in our
[1:45:06] day I think it'd be her obsessed to
[1:45:09] entertain his presence
[1:45:13] honor love give him our everything
[1:45:20] he's doing something Supernatural today
[1:45:29] he's promised there would be a bride's
[1:45:30] Revival he said that there will come a

[1:46:10] denominate the blades and the tassel and
[1:46:13] the shook but the weak cannot change
[1:46:15] it's got to be a Ministry just exactly
[1:46:19] on the word like he was on the word and
[1:46:22] like the first church was on the word
[1:46:24] spirit filled Spirit fed not
[1:46:28] denominational fat word fed

[1:47:29] you wouldn't be setting under the
[1:47:31] anointed word of the hour but what
[1:47:33] you've got to start doing is
[1:47:35] entertaining God's word instead of
[1:47:37] entertaining your condemnation
[1:47:42] foreign
[1:47:44] condemnation belongs to the serpency
[1:47:47] that is The Condemned seed you are the
[1:47:51] Fallen seed and you have been restored

[1:48:09] now you might be in the same jail hell a
[1:48:11] jail cell with them
[1:48:15] but when the angel of the Lord shows up
[1:48:18] and says you don't belong in that in
[1:48:20] that denominational system
[1:48:22] you don't belong in the Creed you don't
[1:48:24] belong in the dog but you don't belong
[1:48:25] in the Cesspool of sin what happened God
[1:48:29] sent a message to you to come out of her
[1:48:33] my people that you receive not of her
[1:48:36] plagues
[1:48:37] [Applause]
[1:48:43] if you entertain the word of the Lord in
[1:48:45] your mind like you entertain that
[1:48:47] condemning Spirit you would be a lot
[1:48:49] further along
[1:48:50] [Applause]
[1:48:57] if you had received the word of the Lord
[1:49:01] that was spoke by the prophet of God
[1:49:07] you would be standing up chasing Giants
[1:49:09] right now
[1:49:10] [Applause]

[1:49:13] Beetle chase you around

[1:49:40] condemnation
[1:49:44] Hallelujah
[1:49:46] come on now
[1:49:49] this story comes to mind I remember
[1:49:53] some years back
[1:49:55] there was a girl
[1:49:57] that had been stolen or kidnapped from
[1:49:59] the hospital when when she was just a
[1:50:01] baby
[1:50:03] and
[1:50:04] and now
[1:50:06] that Mom and Dad had never given up and
[1:50:08] looking for and every year they were
[1:50:09] doing that and that FBI or whatever that
[1:50:12] and that digital thing there to what the
[1:50:15] girl might look like and every year
[1:50:16] they'd put it out and put it out and
[1:50:18] finally the girl's 12 years old
[1:50:21] and someone sees this image and says
[1:50:23] calls the hotline and said I think we
[1:50:25] just seen the girl
[1:50:27] and so they they go and investigate it
[1:50:29] sure enough
[1:50:31] they do the DNA test

[1:50:44] known the the depths of perversion and

[1:55:20] often one to another
[1:55:22] and the Lord hearkened and heard it and
[1:55:26] a book of remembrance was written before
[1:55:27] him for them that feared him that
[1:55:29] thought upon his name are y'all hearing

[1:55:42] the day when I make up my jewels
[1:55:45] I will spare them as a man spareth his
[1:55:48] own son that serveth him and then shall
[1:55:52] he return and discern between righteous
[1:55:54] and wicked between him that serveth God
[1:55:57] in him that serveth him not for behold
[1:56:00] the day cometh that shall burn as an
[1:56:02] oven and all the proud yea all that do
[1:56:05] wickedly shall be stubble and the day
[1:56:07] that cometh shall burn them up saith the
[1:56:09] Lord of hosts that it shall not leave
[1:56:11] them neither root nor branch

[2:00:44] but you see
[2:00:46] there is a connection
[2:00:50] they have found they have discovered
[2:00:52] that fourth dimension
[2:00:56] that fourth dimension
[2:00:58] there are sound waves coming through the
[2:01:01] building
[2:01:02] can you say mine
[2:01:04] you don't have to go to the radio
[2:01:05] station to hear your favorite song all

[2:01:27] around here there's a few of you amen

[2:01:32] station 1200 miles away from you
[2:01:37] did you know when I go way up North
[2:01:40] I have driven although I've driven as
[2:01:43] far as you can go up in the in in in
[2:01:45] Ontario we're talking about as far up as
[2:01:49] you can go
[2:01:50] hey you can't and it's all dirt road
[2:01:55] and I could steal
[2:01:57] hear my music
[2:01:59] you know why because somebody tapped in
[2:02:03] to that fourth dimension
[2:02:07] if this little congregation right here
[2:02:09] tonight could understand that it's more
[2:02:11] than a preacher
[2:02:13] it's more than a church service
[2:02:16] it's it is the presence of God
[2:02:20] and when the brother Branham would stand
[2:02:22] there and declare he is here
[2:02:26] you couldn't see it but he could see it
[2:02:29] you had to believe it and he taught us
[2:02:33] how to enter into that prison
[2:02:36] can you say man
[2:02:38] oh my
[2:02:40] Spirits travel on words
[2:02:43] your eyes and your ears issue amen they
[2:02:46] they they they Usher Spirits into your
[2:02:49] soul songs Television Internet texts and
[2:02:53] people are not aware that they are
[2:02:55] subjected to Spirits on a daily basis by
[2:02:59] simply tuning into that junk with their
[2:03:02] phone
[2:03:05] and you wonder why you ain't got no
[2:03:07] faith it's because you are channeling
[2:03:09] demons into your mind
[2:03:11] [Applause]
[2:03:15] if you shut the channels off to those
[2:03:17] demons and put that same anointing of
[2:03:20] the Holy Spirit into your mind
[2:03:24] [Applause]
[2:03:26] if it worked for the prophet it'll work
[2:03:29] for you
[2:03:29] [Applause]
[2:03:31] what can you say Amen
[2:03:34] you sound like to have some scriptures
[2:03:36] okay First Corinthians 15 and 33 be not
[2:03:39] deceived evil Communications corrupt
[2:03:42] good manners
[2:03:46] well praise the Lord
[2:03:48] your thoughts
[2:03:50] the process of thinking the formation of
[2:03:52] opinions your thoughts is what you
[2:03:54] consider your thoughts is what you
[2:03:56] Ponder upon that's why he told Timothy
[2:04:00] Sean profane and vain babblings that
[2:04:03] will increase unto more ungodliness and
[2:04:06] their words will eat like a canker
[2:04:11] shut those Spirits off
[2:04:15] and entertain
[2:04:17] the presence
[2:04:20] of the Lord
[2:04:25] when you wake up in the morning time
[2:04:30] it's good to entertain him

[2:06:10] and we were all fixing to entertain
[2:06:13] that devil that had just walked in the
[2:06:16] door
[2:06:18] but instead we refused to entertain him

[2:07:58] the kids needed to run around Sister
[2:07:59] Laura went out I went into Walmart and
[2:08:02] so the kids were just out playing around
[2:08:03] in Littlefield and and and one of the
[2:08:05] boys had fallen and snapped his leg it
[2:08:08] was it went into a hole and snapped that
[2:08:10] leg

[2:08:17] got a I've got to be in at a service
[2:08:19] we're a long ways away from home and
[2:08:21] they prayed
[2:08:23] God came on the scene
[2:08:26] and set the leg
[2:08:30] you see
[2:08:35] entertain God
[2:08:38] and not experience the supernatural
[2:08:44] thank you
[2:08:53] but you've got to keep your channels
[2:08:56] clear
[2:08:58] are you understanding you cannot be
[2:09:01] inside them and have an entertaining the
[2:09:04] presence of the Lord
[2:09:07] you cannot be in two places are you
[2:09:09] young people listening to me
[2:09:12] this is not just for the old man this is
[2:09:15] for young people
[2:09:17] but you're gonna have to make up your
[2:09:19] mind I'm going to take my eyes off of
[2:09:23] all of Sodom and I'm going to walk with
[2:09:27] God
[2:09:36] can you see man
[2:09:38] wandering thoughts brother Branham talks
[2:09:40] about wandering thoughts
[2:09:42] amen
[2:09:44] curious thoughts
[2:09:46] exploring starts in the mind
[2:09:49] and then sin is conceived amen
[2:09:52] brother Brandon says the reason they do
[2:09:54] this is because they're not conscious
[2:09:56] that God is watching
[2:09:58] you lose the very thought of God being
[2:10:00] there listening at you
[2:10:02] God is putting down everything you're
[2:10:03] thinking about he knows it in his
[2:10:05] recording book your thoughts are louder
[2:10:07] in heaven than your voice is here on the
[2:10:09] Earth
[2:10:10] think
[2:10:11] the right thoughts
[2:10:14] can you say man
[2:10:16] now
[2:10:19] brother Branham says now we don't have
[2:10:21] any reverence to God you the musicians
[2:10:23] can come everybody thinks he's so
[2:10:25] secured
[2:10:28] they don't think reverent they don't
[2:10:31] reverent God like they should
[2:10:33] why do they do this
[2:10:36] because they're not conscience
[2:10:38] of his presence
[2:10:42] that's the reason people do that they
[2:10:44] don't recognize it they can't they can't
[2:10:46] comprehend that they're in the presence
[2:10:48] of God their minds become so con
[2:10:51] perverted and taken up in the things of
[2:10:53] the world until they don't even pay
[2:10:55] attention to it
[2:10:56] go to church sure
[2:10:58] realize that you're in the presence of
[2:11:01] God not only in a church wherever you
[2:11:04] are you're in the presence of God
[2:11:08] if they could do as David said I put the
[2:11:11] lord always before my face therefore
[2:11:15] I shall not be moved
[2:11:18] as long as the Lord was before him
[2:11:21] he could not
[2:11:23] be moved
[2:11:25] another place now I think the reason
[2:11:27] that people do those things is because
[2:11:28] they're not conscious of his presence
[2:11:30] yet he is there whether you think he is
[2:11:33] or not he sees every look you make every
[2:11:35] move you make he knows all about it but
[2:11:38] we ought to realize this
[2:11:42] am I making my point
[2:11:48] brother Branham in uh
[2:11:51] you know
[2:11:53] in discernment
[2:11:56] and
[2:11:59] he he says
[2:12:02] he says do you believe that you're in
[2:12:04] the presence in his presence
[2:12:06] that's what makes you feel that way
[2:12:08] something's vibrating over your spirit
[2:12:10] that you know being a Christian has to
[2:12:13] be the holy ghost or what this audience
[2:12:15] would only believe like you just now
[2:12:17] lady if this whole audience could
[2:12:19] believe for one moment you would see one
[2:12:22] of the greatest things happened there'd
[2:12:23] be a spontaneous wave of power hit this
[2:12:26] building here I speak in the name of
[2:12:29] Jesus Christ
[2:12:33] that's a prophet
[2:12:36] are y'all hearing me

[2:12:43] he says another place he said look at
[2:12:45] this woman standing here

[2:13:04] like everyone could see that now there's

[2:13:09] arthritis raise up lady the other lady

[2:13:24] get this because you grieve the spirit
[2:13:26] of God look this away and be alert
