[5:35] I speak to us tonight father we pray we
[5:39] love you Lord in Jesus Christ name Amen
[5:42] hey man you may be seated I guess I just
[5:47] testify I'm brother Ronnie long and just
[5:52] a regular old brother except for I'm a
[5:54] son of God so that makes me pretty
[5:56] special I believe I believe that if we
[5:59] could just recognize that that part that
[6:03] eternal part in us we would be expecting
[6:06] a lot more we would be hungry for a lot
[6:09] more if we could say that we we came
[6:12] from eternity and we're going back to
[6:13] eternity and you know maybe you don't
[6:16] know me but I know you
[6:18] we know the church here I think we came
[6:20] for the meetings and back in September I
[6:23] think they were and we just had a
[6:24] glorious time in the Lord and there were
[6:26] so many different faces and things but
[6:28] maybe we didn't get to know everybody
[6:30] but we'd sure love you in the name of
[6:33] the Lord and in the ministry here has
[6:35] been such a blessing in my life
[6:36] personally just getting to know your
[6:39] pastor over the last few years and and
[6:42] what the Lord has done in my life
[6:43] through his ministry and I believe it's
[6:46] just beginning I believe I'm gonna hear
[6:48] more and more and I believe the Lord is
[6:51] gonna deliver deliver a lot more than
[6:54] just me through the ministry from this
[6:56] pulpit I believe in a supernatural God
[6:59] and I don't want to take time away from
[7:02] the service but but maybe I just share a
[7:04] quick testimony if that's all right and
[7:06] and there's been a few times in my life
[7:08] when I've asked God for the supernatural
[7:11] not just on a whim or on a feeling but
[7:14] when you when you're really get in the
[7:15] depths of despair and you ask God for
[7:17] the supernatural
[7:18] and I can testify tonight that he always
[7:21] delivers
[7:23] he's always shown the supernatural and
[7:25] you know a lot of times maybe we don't
[7:27] have we don't have the gifts that we
[7:29] that we want and you say well I don't
[7:32] see the supernatural the Lord doesn't
[7:34] work with me that way but I would just
[7:35] ask tonight if we could ask God to open
[7:37] our eyes tonight I know he'll do it
[7:41] because he's done it for me you just
[7:43] pray to the Lord and your seat and say
[7:44] Lord I want to see the supernatural
[7:46] not I want to see you move like we've
[7:49] heard of you move in the end the books
[7:51] in the Bible and we heard of you move
[7:53] through the ministry of the Prophet I
[7:54] want to see you move tonight and I just
[7:59] just share this testimony for the glory
[8:01] of God maybe to increase our faith and
[8:03] there was a service that I was I was at
[8:05] and at this little village up in Alaska
[8:08] it was just a few maybe 60 people there
[8:11] and and the word of the Lord had been
[8:14] had been coming forth for a few days and
[8:17] and there was a there was a brother that
[8:20] used to go to the church there and he
[8:21] had fallen away from from belief in the
[8:23] message of what we believe in and we
[8:26] went to visit them and I said well we'll
[8:27] see you we'll see you tonight and he
[8:29] said what's tonight I said what's a nice
[8:31] church he said why don't go to that
[8:33] church I said well we'll see you tonight
[8:35] and so he came to the church and the
[8:38] first the first service of the meeting
[8:39] he was sitting in the back row and the
[8:41] pastor kind of elbowed me and he said
[8:42] that's the first time I've seen that
[8:44] brother in seven years here civil praise
[8:47] the Lord that service came and God did
[8:50] work and then the next night
[8:52] he was sitting in the middle and the
[8:56] next night he was sitting in the front
[8:57] row and I began to testify that if you
[9:01] ask God for the supernatural he'll show
[9:03] you the supernatural and and the Spirit
[9:06] of Lord began to fall in the building
[9:07] and people just began to make requests
[9:09] out in the it's a little bit less formal
[9:12] there and and sometimes that's good we
[9:14] didn't have a microphone we didn't have
[9:16] speakers we didn't have monitors we
[9:18] didn't have the electronics we just
[9:20] barely had lights on but the Spirit of
[9:22] God began to move in that building and
[9:24] and the people's faith began to ignite
[9:26] and I remembered when we were when we
[9:28] were there in that service we were
[9:30] taking a Oberer from the airport to the
[9:32] center Airport to get there and and she
[9:35] said oh you're going to see my people
[9:36] she said if you can show them the
[9:37] supernatural they'll believe whatever
[9:40] you preach to him and so that whole time
[9:42] that was on my mind i lord i want to see
[9:44] the supernatural in this meeting i want
[9:46] to see the supernatural come and and I
[9:50] had that on the back of my mind during
[9:51] this service and and just asking God and
[9:54] people began to come up for prayer and
[9:56] the Spirit of God began to come down
[9:58] like a wave
[9:59] I don't know if I've ever experienced it
[10:01] that strong in my life just a wave
[10:02] through the building and and one sister
[10:05] came up and she began to pray and and
[10:08] she asked that she would have a renewed
[10:10] experience in the word and and I'm just
[10:12] telling all this for the glory of God
[10:13] that it could increase our faith and and
[10:15] and and the Spirit of God began to tell
[10:17] her exactly what her prayer was and what
[10:19] what she was praying for and and that it
[10:21] called out her daughter that was sitting
[10:23] in the back back of the church and said
[10:25] that you actually praying for your
[10:26] daughter because she's suicidal but in
[10:28] Jesus name she is gonna be delivered and
[10:30] her daughter ran to the front she said
[10:32] that's me and it began to build the
[10:34] people's faith in the building and and
[10:36] one after the other the people began to
[10:38] get prayed for and to begin to get
[10:40] delivered through the the ministry that
[10:41] was there and and and then the pastor
[10:46] got out in front of the church and he
[10:48] said I have a need he said I feel the
[10:51] power of God is in this building he said
[10:52] I have eight children and he said only
[10:55] four of them are serving the Lord he
[10:57] said but I would like to call the other
[10:59] four his name before the Lord that they
[11:01] would that they would serve the Lord he
[11:03] said but I want to start with my oldest
[11:05] son he said I haven't seen him in a long
[11:08] time he's in the wrong crowd he's he's
[11:11] in drugs and he's in he's an alcoholic I
[11:14] don't know where he's added mind you
[11:15] this is a village in the middle of
[11:17] Alaska where you can't drive there
[11:19] there's no roads there's only about
[11:21] eight hundred people there you have to
[11:22] fly to get there on a little plane he
[11:26] said I haven't seen him in years I think
[11:27] he's he's somewhere down in the city and
[11:31] we began to pray and other other other
[11:34] things begin to come forth in the in the
[11:36] prayer line and we begin to pray for
[11:37] that that Pastor seeking the need and I
[11:41] just felt the power Lord to say in Jesus
[11:43] name we said at eight times for all of
[11:45] his children he said but I'm claiming my
[11:47] first one to come forth to the name of
[11:49] Jesus Christ and he came back behind the
[11:52] pulpit and kept leading the songs and
[11:53] and we saw we saw the God do some
[11:55] tremendous things and then all of a
[11:58] sudden I began to see his wife start to
[12:00] shout in the spirit and dance around and
[12:02] and run in the spirit across the church
[12:05] and just begin to twirl and I looked and
[12:06] the pastor was twirling around the
[12:08] platform I thought what what just
[12:10] happened that I
[12:11] and I looked in the back and a young man
[12:13] had walked to the back door God's my
[12:17] witness a young man had walked in the
[12:19] back door there's no God like our God he
[12:28] had walked in the back door and he
[12:29] looked a little rough at first and he
[12:31] was a little red-faced and he leaned up
[12:33] against that wall and the songs begin to
[12:36] get sung and before I knew it he raised
[12:38] his hand and then he started singing the
[12:41] songs with no words up on the screen he
[12:43] just started sighs - this this boy's
[12:45] been in church before well I think you
[12:47] know the story
[12:48] it was his oldest son that he hadn't
[12:50] seen in years on and off night it wasn't
[12:54] even a regular Church night found his
[12:55] way to that church when you just can't
[12:58] get there you got to be there you don't
[13:01] just show up in that village but God had
[13:03] ordained that before the foundation of
[13:05] the world that we would be having
[13:06] service that night and that he would
[13:09] have a need in the church and that God
[13:10] would respond to that boy's heart and
[13:12] bring him in the back door for a
[13:14] vindication of what this message is is
[13:17] the truth and that brother that had
[13:19] fallen away from the message was sitting
[13:21] right there in the front row when it
[13:23] happened and he knew the boy he knew him
[13:25] when he left church and he stood up and
[13:26] he said I can believe that message and
[13:29] he ran up to the front and said my faith
[13:32] is restored in the message of Malachi 4
[13:34] [Applause]
[13:35] there's no God like our God we serve
[13:39] this because it's a living God he's
[13:42] alive to do the miraculous in our life
[13:44] who we can call on him to do the
[13:45] supernatural he will answer he will
[13:48] answer us if we could just call on him
[13:52] to do the supernatural just about a
[13:55] month ago I was in a meeting and in
[13:56] Africa and the brother came up and said
[13:58] I need to see the supernatural I've had
[14:01] epilepsy my whole life 24 years he said
[14:06] I want to see the supernatural I said do
[14:08] you believe that this message is true he
[14:10] said if it can produce the supernatural
[14:12] I believe it's the truth and we pray for
[14:14] that boy and I watched his eye he had a
[14:17] crooked eye I watched it go straight and
[14:18] those Caesar that Caesar spirit went off
[14:21] and left him and went out the door
[14:22] because he was looking for the
[14:24] for natural so I would ask us tonight
[14:26] are we looking for the supernatural to
[14:28] take place in our life are we looking
[14:30] for God to do something miraculous that
[14:32] no man can do but it must be God that's
[14:38] the kind of God we serve that's that's
[14:40] the message that we believe in it's not
[14:42] about what we can do in ourselves but
[14:44] it's about believing on him that's
[14:46] already done it we sure love you in the
[14:48] name of Jesus Christ we believe that
[14:58] tonight don't we maybe sister Tracy
[15:03] would come and sing for us at this time
[15:04] if she would and then after her maybe
[15:07] sister autumn would prepare to come for
[15:08] us god bless you

[16:19] it takes all you can do just to move
[16:25] much less be there's the race but don't

[48:57] Book of Kings here first Kings I want to
[49:03] read from first Kings the eighteenth
[49:05] chap
[49:05] I want to read from the 38 verse here
[49:11] first Kings chapter 18 verse 38 you'll
[49:15] recognize this is when Elijah is upon
[49:19] the mountain he's on Mount Carmel
[49:21] there's been a showdown and the Bible
[49:24] said then the fire of the Lord fell and
[49:27] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[49:30] wood and the stones and the dust and
[49:32] licked up the water that was in the
[49:34] trench and when all the people saw it
[49:37] they fell on their faces and they said
[49:43] the Lord he is the God the Lord he is
[49:53] the God if you go with me to the book of
[49:57] Joshua in the second chapter that was
[50:01] the children of Israel how many knowles
[50:02] brother Bram said that was the the 7,000
[50:05] that Elijah was looking for when they
[50:07] saw that vindicated Word they screamed
[50:09] out he is God now here's a Gentile
[50:14] testimony from the Old Testament when
[50:17] they went into the spies into Jericho
[50:19] they found Rahab back there and she said
[50:22] under the men I know that the Lord have
[50:24] given you the land and that your terror
[50:29] is falling upon them all the inhabitants
[50:31] of the land faint because of you but we
[50:34] have heard how the Lord dried up the
[50:35] water of the Red Sea for you when you
[50:38] came out of Egypt and what you did under
[50:41] the two kings of the Amer rights that
[50:43] were on the other side of Jordan shown
[50:45] and all whom ye utterly destroyed and as
[50:50] soon as we had heard these things our
[50:53] hearts did melt
[50:55] neither did there remain any more
[50:57] courage in any man because of you for
[51:02] the Lord your God He is God in heaven
[51:06] above and in earth beneath
[51:10] Amen let's just bow our hearts father it
[51:13] is such an honor to be here tonight with
[51:14] your children and Lord as we have read
[51:18] your word father I pray that my voice
[51:22] would mingle with the voices of these
[51:25] from the scripture that you are God Lord
[51:29] we have found you to be the God in the
[51:31] heaven and God in the earth you're the
[51:34] God that controls all things and we ask
[51:36] you tonight that you would show yourself
[51:38] alive that you would come amongst us Oh
[51:42] God as you have promised as you have
[51:44] given us your word and we ask you now
[51:46] that you would just take this meeting
[51:47] Lord may you use us in us in a special
[51:51] way may you set us aside this evening to
[51:55] speak to your children and father as we
[51:57] would say something to them I pray that
[51:59] you would bless them
[52:01] let your anointing charge this building
[52:04] Oh God
[52:05] now we're asking you for a divine
[52:07] presence we commit this meeting into
[52:10] your hand blessing the people Lord
[52:12] present and them the Lord that are
[52:14] streaming tonight I pray that you would
[52:16] bless them Oh God me your hand be upon
[52:18] them if there be any sick Lord or any
[52:21] need there I just pray that you would
[52:23] extend your mercy father we ask it now
[52:26] in the name of Jesus Christ we ask for
[52:29] these things a man and a man and may God
[52:34] bless you tonight as you would be seated
[52:36] I want to if I can just speak to you a
[52:38] little bit tonight and I want to talk to
[52:40] you if I would take a title tonight I
[52:42] want to talk to you about this that God
[52:44] our God he is God our our God is God
[52:53] amen and I know that there's a lot of
[52:55] different things a lot of people talk
[52:57] about gods and they and I've traveled in
[53:00] the in the eastern world and I've seen
[53:02] all of the religions and the idols and
[53:04] the different aspects of what people
[53:06] think and believe amen but in all of my
[53:09] travels and experiences and and all the
[53:12] people that I know I have found one
[53:14] thing remains to be true that our God he
[53:18] is God amen Jesus Christ is a supreme
[53:23] deity he is above all other gods when I
[53:27] think of this tonight I think of how the
[53:29] Bible would recognize him and Jesus
[53:32] himself would say that I am the God of
[53:35] Abraham and the god of Isaac and the God
[53:38] of Jacob and God is not the god of the
[53:42] dead but of the living a man I believe
[53:45] that he is God now tonight when we think
[53:48] about this we think about the name of
[53:51] God and we we say God but you know the
[53:53] word God would be translated in English
[53:56] of course but if you start thinking
[53:58] about Hebrew and you start thinking
[53:59] about Elohim and Jehovah and you start
[54:02] thinking about the titles and the
[54:04] appropriations of the names to God amen
[54:06] but you know it's not until you get into
[54:08] Matthew that you begin to understand
[54:10] that there is a human name of God and
[54:13] that that human name according to
[54:15] Matthew chapter 1 and verse 25 the Bible
[54:18] said and that he knew her not till she
[54:20] had brought forth her son her firstborn
[54:22] son and called his name Jesus so Jesus
[54:28] would be the only human name that God
[54:30] would use and that would be a name for
[54:33] all redemption for everything that a
[54:35] human needs would come through the name
[54:37] of Jesus Christ everything that God has
[54:39] for the church tonight will come through
[54:42] the name of Jesus Christ amen now if you
[54:45] start looking at names of course names
[54:48] characterizes life and you know brother
[54:50] brems teaching of how even Elvis and and
[54:53] these names even Brandon Lee these kinds
[54:55] of names didn't even come to the end
[54:57] time so there's certain kinds of names
[54:59] represent certain things no brother man
[55:01] says when you start talking about names
[55:03] characterizing things he said people
[55:05] said well brother Branham that's
[55:06] numerology he said no now that's thus
[55:09] sayeth the Lord
[55:10] a name will characterize a person and
[55:13] when you start talking about a name so
[55:16] you say the name of Jesus Christ that is
[55:19] characterizing a life that when you say
[55:22] the name you're talking about their life
[55:24] that is behind that name so when you say
[55:27] something in the name of Jesus you're
[55:29] invoking more than just a human name but
[55:32] you're talking about the life
[55:34] behind that name when you call me a
[55:36] Lawson you're talking about my heritage
[55:38] and where I come from in the blood and
[55:40] and that name carries something well
[55:43] when you say the name of Jesus you're
[55:45] starting to talk about something more
[55:47] than a human it's the life that was
[55:49] behind that name now tonight we think
[55:51] about approaching God and we approach
[55:53] God in the name of Jesus but you you see
[55:57] that when the Bible was first written
[55:59] when Moses talks about a God and he
[56:02] starts talking about how that God
[56:04] created the heavens and the earth now
[56:06] you go back that far and you start
[56:08] finding out that God was Elohim which
[56:11] would have been he was he was God
[56:13] brother man said actually a self
[56:15] existing one in other words no one was
[56:17] there with him amen but he was just God
[56:20] or Elohim right amen and that meant that
[56:23] he existed with his family you go read
[56:26] Genesis 1 and you'll see the Bible says
[56:28] and God created the heavens and earth
[56:30] and God spoke and God did but in Genesis
[56:33] the second chapter God Himself takes a
[56:36] name change when he creates Adam the
[56:40] Bible said and the Lord God formed man
[56:43] from the dust of the earth so now he's
[56:45] adding a jehovah unto elohim so he's now
[56:49] saying jehovah Elohim in other words God
[56:52] is not self existent anymore he has
[56:55] created something off of himself which
[56:58] would be like him which was Adam and Eve
[57:01] is that right so the first time God ever
[57:03] took an ancient was when the word
[57:05] created a being that was both male and
[57:08] female amen in that male and female
[57:10] being created together amen caused God
[57:13] to change his name because now he's not
[57:16] existing by himself but he has extended
[57:18] himself in family and so now he begins
[57:21] to call himself Jehovah God or in other
[57:24] words so now he's having a relationship
[57:27] amen and when a man begins to have a
[57:30] relationship with his family it begins
[57:33] to pull characters out of him Amen that
[57:36] other people maybe never seen never
[57:38] never you know when a man becomes a
[57:40] daddy Amen you see him
[57:42] in character like he's never been a man
[57:45] becomes a husband things begin to be
[57:47] drawn out of him and we find when glob
[57:49] is self-existent there was no exhibit a
[57:52] Shanor no no there was no release of the
[57:55] great things that was in him but as soon
[57:58] as he had a family
[57:59] amen then God now had a place that he
[58:02] could release the character amen and the
[58:05] great power that was held inside of him
[58:08] and in his ability when you go back in
[58:10] the scripture and you begin to read how
[58:12] that God changed his name and becomes of
[58:15] course Jehovah Elohim brother man says
[58:18] it amen in the message seven compound
[58:20] names of Jehovah 1955 he said seven
[58:23] compound names of Jehovah in other words
[58:25] it was what Jehovah is made up seven
[58:29] redemptive names and these would be his
[58:31] attitude toward the people from Eden
[58:35] back to Eden again see wrapped in the
[58:38] seven redemptive names so when you start
[58:40] talking about Jehovah he meant you just
[58:42] say the name Jehovah amen and it means a
[58:45] lot but but in the days of Adam when he
[58:49] was in the garden he meant he knew him
[58:51] as Jehovah but there was more to God
[58:54] than just the time or the word Jehovah
[58:57] that was so much more in God and brother
[59:00] BAM taught us that God allowed the fall
[59:02] in the Garden of Eden
[59:04] amen not a man it was never his will for
[59:07] them to fall but it was certainly God's
[59:09] will for them to know he was a redeemer
[59:11] it was certainly never his will for
[59:14] someone to get sick but it was certainly
[59:17] his will for someone to know he was a
[59:18] healer see so God then had things in him
[59:22] that could only be drawn out by
[59:25] situations amen and if you start looking
[59:28] you'll see how Amen that God into the
[59:31] children of Abraham releases his name of
[59:35] Jehovah when the scripture talks about
[59:37] the first time that God releases an
[59:40] attribute to the name Jehovah is when he
[59:43] talks about being Jehovah Jireh in
[59:45] Genesis 22 in verse 13 and 14 this is
[59:48] released to Abraham when Abraham was
[59:51] going up on a mountain in the end of his
[59:54] life he's waited 25 years for a child
[59:57] and then God has told him to kill the
[1:00:01] thing that he's been waiting on for 25
[1:00:04] years so he's not being tested on
[1:00:06] whether or not he believes God to have a
[1:00:08] child now he's being tested on the child
[1:00:11] that God gave him and it says right in
[1:00:13] the end of his life it's actually the
[1:00:15] last test of Abraham's life and it of
[1:00:18] course is a type of word the bride is
[1:00:21] today and as Abraham went up on the
[1:00:24] mountain with his son Isaac Amen
[1:00:27] remember the story they're going and
[1:00:28] they're gonna go to worship because God
[1:00:30] said to offer thy son Isaac and and
[1:00:32] they're gonna go up on the mountain and
[1:00:34] Isaac knowing the style of worship his
[1:00:36] father he knows he sacrifices animals
[1:00:39] and gives the blood back to his God
[1:00:41] Jehovah and and and and they usually
[1:00:43] burned the sacrifice so God and God has
[1:00:46] Abraham taken Isaac up the mountain and
[1:00:48] as they're going up the mountain and the
[1:00:51] part way up there of course Abraham and
[1:00:54] Isaac are talking and Isaac says to his
[1:00:55] father well father here's the wood and
[1:00:58] here's the fire but worse there's the
[1:01:01] lamb he meant now he knew a sacrifice
[1:01:05] required a lamb so so Isaac was actually
[1:01:10] realizing that we need something here
[1:01:13] that we don't have now of course
[1:01:15] Abraham was making his son Isaac the
[1:01:18] very sacrifice and he was going to have
[1:01:20] to sacrifice him but before they ever
[1:01:22] went on the mountain
[1:01:23] amen before he ever went to take his
[1:01:25] life he actually already said the boy
[1:01:28] and I will go up on the mountain and the
[1:01:31] boy and I will return now Abraham
[1:01:35] exactly intended to sacrifice his child
[1:01:38] amen but he knew that he had received
[1:01:40] him from the dead and that God was able
[1:01:43] to raise him from the dead he meant now
[1:01:46] now we find that when Abraham got to the
[1:01:49] place he was not willing they meant to
[1:01:51] withhold anything from God and when he
[1:01:54] was laying there his son was there he
[1:01:56] was about to take his life it was in
[1:01:58] that very moment the angel stayed the
[1:02:00] hand of Abraham he
[1:02:02] Abraham thou have not withheld 9 only
[1:02:04] Son amen and then God began to bless him
[1:02:07] and then immediately they turned to look
[1:02:11] and there was a realm Amen hung over in
[1:02:14] the bushes by its horns and mother man
[1:02:17] said now Abraham had gathered rocks
[1:02:19] Abraham had built an altar Abraham had
[1:02:22] been up there while had had never saw
[1:02:24] that realm he said where did that Ram
[1:02:26] come from he said God created that realm
[1:02:31] Amen that Ram wasn't there to start with
[1:02:34] God created the that realm amen and when
[1:02:37] Abraham saw that God was willing to
[1:02:40] create something to provide the need of
[1:02:43] his child he turned around and built
[1:02:46] another altar and he said my God is
[1:02:49] Jehovah Jireh he is the Lord that
[1:02:54] provide us our every need let me tell

[1:03:35] fed 5,000 people with just a few two

[1:07:58] coming from
[1:07:59] we've got to know the God that can
[1:08:01] supply it you know to think of it
[1:08:07] tonight hey man that's a prophecy lading
[1:08:09] over you hey Paul said it he said

[1:08:15] it'll be without spot wrinkle it'll be a
[1:08:18] glorious church William Brandon come
[1:08:20] along and said it'll be an invincible
[1:08:22] army he said is she will know who she is
[1:08:25] she will know what she stands for and
[1:08:28] the devil will be powerless before her
[1:08:30] and you said where's it coming from
[1:08:32] I say it's coming right out of you I say
[1:08:35] God is able to take a man or woman a
[1:08:38] child
[1:08:39] and create a faithful the inside of him
[1:08:41] to make them everything God said they
[1:08:44] would be oh my do you see amen look how
[1:08:52] long they could have lived on Jehovah
[1:08:54] Jireh but God said whoa wait a minute
[1:08:57] I'm more than that how I can provide but
[1:09:02] I'm more than a provider I tell you what
[1:09:05] I am I am God
[1:09:06] and I am Jehovah Rapha I am Jehovah
[1:09:11] Rapha Java Rafe is actually known as the
[1:09:15] Lord that healeth can you imagine the
[1:09:18] way God shows this to the church he
[1:09:21] shows it to him when Moses crosses the
[1:09:23] Red Sea and they've been through all
[1:09:25] that wilderness and all that trouble and
[1:09:27] they get out and they come up to a to a
[1:09:30] pool of water and that water is bitter
[1:09:33] waters the bitter waters of Myra is it
[1:09:36] matter is that is that correct bitter
[1:09:38] words of Myra they get up to that water
[1:09:40] and while their stands have been the
[1:09:41] waters of Myra amen it's right there
[1:09:43] Amen that Moses finds a stick laying on
[1:09:47] the bank and that stick represents cry
[1:09:51] and Moses throws that stick in the water
[1:09:53] and heals the water and right there he
[1:09:56] built an altar and says he is Jehovah
[1:09:59] Rapha the Lord that healeth me now think
[1:10:04] of this tonight because Moses Moses is
[1:10:07] leading two million people forty years
[1:10:11] through a wilderness
[1:10:12] Amen can you imagine the kind of of
[1:10:14] Medicine bag you would need for two
[1:10:17] million people in 40 years of wilderness
[1:10:19] but the man said I'd like to see his
[1:10:21] medicine cabinet he said he only had one
[1:10:23] thing he said he said I had the Lord
[1:10:26] that he loved me but he lovely
[1:10:30] hey man you said preacher you you
[1:10:32] against medicine absolutely not I take
[1:10:35] all my medicine in the name of Jesus I
[1:10:37] know that doctors help me
[1:10:39] I know hospitals help me but if I'm
[1:10:42] healed it's Jesus that heals me
[1:10:45] Amen this man had a prescription for TB
[1:10:50] he had a prescription for problems every
[1:10:52] one of them was the same I am the lord
[1:10:55] that healeth II do you see that was not
[1:10:57] one feeble person in that wilderness so
[1:11:00] somebody says well I'll tell you what
[1:11:02] Amen they must left all the old and sick
[1:11:04] behind a mint but in an amazing that
[1:11:07] there is an entire section of scripture
[1:11:09] about this because Moses argues with
[1:11:12] Pharaoh and you think some of the
[1:11:14] arguments are are no are not worth
[1:11:16] reading but when you go back and realize
[1:11:18] that God made Pharaoh argue with Moses
[1:11:21] about taking the children out of Egypt
[1:11:23] and he said to him Amen just go on in
[1:11:26] lead part of a Mac which was a perfect
[1:11:28] opportunity for Moses to leave the
[1:11:31] sequence behind the feeble ones behind
[1:11:34] remembered Moses said to Pharaoh I'm not
[1:11:37] gonna leave one
[1:11:41] not even gonna leave us behind amen you
[1:11:45] hear what I'm saying to you
[1:11:46] Moses didn't have to leave nobody behind
[1:11:48] because riding for night of the Passover
[1:11:51] they took communion and they eat the
[1:11:54] bread with her shoes holding the staff
[1:11:57] in their hand and when they ate that
[1:11:59] lamb they begin to eat a healing into
[1:12:03] their body oh and they changed something
[1:12:06] tonight that Passover lamb is Jesus
[1:12:09] Christ and he is his word and every time
[1:12:13] we take a pot hopeful I am the lord that
[1:12:17] he the fee that is a healing that comes
[1:12:20] into our body hey man listen we're not
[1:12:23] gonna back up for no devil amen our God
[1:12:26] is a God of healing
[1:12:28] he's a gonna pound he's a God of ability
[1:12:33] no sir devil you showed up at the wrong
[1:12:37] place this is a place where lawyers
[1:12:44] Oh God yes God no run church won't place
[1:13:00] this is a house of God the children
[1:13:06] Abraham's seed they get her in this kind
[1:13:10] of place you see said I'm the Lord that
[1:13:16] he hath II you say preacher what are you
[1:13:20] trying to say I'm trying to say that
[1:13:22] there was not a feeble one Psalms 105 37
[1:13:26] David said he brought them out with
[1:13:28] silver and gold and there was not a
[1:13:30] feeble one among he brought him out with
[1:13:32] silver and gold Jehovah Jireh brought
[1:13:35] him out healed not a snowless
[1:13:38] not a not one in the bunch now what's
[1:13:41] what he's saying to you Psalms 103
[1:13:44] verses 1 to 4 David sang the song bless
[1:13:47] the Lord O my soul and all that is
[1:13:50] within me bless His Holy Name bless the
[1:13:53] Lord O my soul and forget not his
[1:13:55] benefits
[1:13:55] he forgiveth all thine iniquity and he
[1:13:59] healeth all thy diseases in the
[1:14:03] beautiful forgiveness of sin and healing
[1:14:06] of disease is put in the same verse
[1:14:08] that's why the prophet of God said the
[1:14:10] same blood that saves you it's the same
[1:14:13] blood that heals you Amen if you're
[1:14:16] standing tonight confessing your
[1:14:18] salvation you still might have
[1:14:20] temptation but you don't change your
[1:14:22] confession and if you're standing for a
[1:14:25] healing you still might have pain you
[1:14:27] still might have suffering but we've
[1:14:30] never changed the confession because by
[1:14:33] here
[1:14:34] ah he is the God that forgiveth disease
[1:14:46] he is the God that forgive Athan
[1:14:49] iniquity who healeth eye diseases that's
[1:14:52] right the brass serpent was put in the
[1:14:54] wilderness as seeing already judged amen
[1:14:58] the people looked upon it and were
[1:14:59] healed of course that brass serpent
[1:15:02] represented Jesus Christ going to the
[1:15:05] cross and on the cross took the
[1:15:08] judgments of our sin and in his body
[1:15:11] paid every debt he paid every bed for
[1:15:16] sin
[1:15:16] listen to me not people saying well
[1:15:18] maybe something happens because of this
[1:15:20] problem baby something happens because
[1:15:22] of this problem the first thing we need
[1:15:24] to do is answer the same question amen
[1:15:27] if we put it under the blood and we
[1:15:29] confess our sins in the blood there is
[1:15:32] now no more condemnation to feel better
[1:15:36] in Christ Jesus and we've got a right to
[1:15:39] stand in the principle of every promise
[1:15:42] in the Bible and Saint by His stripes we
[1:15:46] are healed Isaiah 53 who have to believe
[1:15:55] that reported to whom is the arm of the
[1:15:56] Lord for he shall grow up as a tender
[1:15:59] plant as a root out of a dry ground he
[1:16:01] has no form or comeliness that we should
[1:16:03] see him there's no beauty that we should
[1:16:04] desire him he has despised and rejected
[1:16:07] a man a man of sorrows acquainted with
[1:16:09] grief he hath hid if it were our faces
[1:16:12] from him he was despised and we esteemed
[1:16:15] in not but surely he hath borne our
[1:16:19] griefs amen in the original sickness or
[1:16:23] pain he has borne our sicknesses our
[1:16:26] griefs and carried away our sorrows our
[1:16:29] pain and yet we did esteem him stricken
[1:16:32] and smitten of God afflicted and
[1:16:35] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:16:37] his bruised for our iniquities the
[1:16:40] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:16:42] and with His stripes we are healed my
[1:16:48] listen to me tonight healing is not free
[1:16:51] but it's paid for healing it's not free
[1:16:55] but it's paid for
[1:16:56] it has been paid for by the very beating
[1:17:00] of the body of Jesus Christ who was
[1:17:03] Jehovah Rapha in the flesh our God come
[1:17:08] and took 39 stripes and carried his body
[1:17:12] to the grid to the to the cross that the
[1:17:15] blessing of Abraham might come on the
[1:17:17] Gentiles through Jesus Christ
[1:17:19] 1st Peter 2 and 24 let's just give the
[1:17:23] devil a beating y'all want to first
[1:17:25] Peter 2:24 he has his own self bare our
[1:17:29] sins in his own body Amen on that tree
[1:17:32] we being dared to see him should live
[1:17:34] unto righteousness by whose stripes ye
[1:17:38] are healed
[1:17:40] the devil was to tell you there's no
[1:17:42] basis for this kind of healing there's
[1:17:44] no basis for miracles there's no basis
[1:17:47] for divine healing but brother Jesus
[1:17:49] Christ took 39 stripes in his body that
[1:17:53] I a sinner could be saved and stand
[1:17:56] tonight and proclaim that Jesus paid the
[1:17:59] price for our redemption in his body
[1:18:04] then by His stripes he were past his
[1:18:07] heel right past hence healed that's what
[1:18:11] he did for you at Calvary then that's
[1:18:13] when he overcome all sickness and sin at
[1:18:16] Calvary Loree think about it tonight you
[1:18:20] say how did in the weekend Healing March
[1:18:22] 16 it is the commission of the church go
[1:18:25] into the world and preach the gospel and
[1:18:27] he that believeth this baptized and
[1:18:30] shall be
[1:18:31] but he that believeth not shall be
[1:18:33] damned these signs shall follow them
[1:18:35] that believe in my name they should cast
[1:18:38] out Devils they shall speak with new
[1:18:40] tongues they shall take up serpents
[1:18:42] didn't they drink deadly thing it shall
[1:18:44] not hurt them they shall lay their hands
[1:18:48] on the sick and they shall recover isn't
[1:18:55] in the Bible is there any sick among you
[1:18:57] let us pray for him let us sing songs
[1:19:00] any sick let him call for the elders let
[1:19:03] them play over him anointing him at all
[1:19:05] in the name of the Lord and the prayer
[1:19:07] of faith shall save the sick and the
[1:19:11] Lord shall raise him up if he have
[1:19:13] committed sins they shall be forgiven
[1:19:15] him I tell you it's powerful here
[1:19:17] tonight because you think it would take
[1:19:19] an angel to do that don't you
[1:19:20] but the Bible said the official fervent
[1:19:22] prayer of a righteous man we love you
[1:19:25] much you say who's the righteous man
[1:19:28] then they say here just like Elijah a
[1:19:32] man of like passion then brother Ellen
[1:19:34] says the righteous man's not a perfect
[1:19:36] man amen he's a man under the blood amen
[1:19:40] a man under the blood is a righteous man
[1:19:42] there's nobody worthy to lay their hands
[1:19:45] on somebody but when a man is under the
[1:19:48] blood he does it in the name of Jesus
[1:19:51] Christ there's an authority
[1:19:59] the same preacher Amen that's just a
[1:20:01] message for the earth
[1:20:02] really Amen Paul said this we for holy
[1:20:05] brethren partakers of my heavenly
[1:20:07] calling consider the Apostle and the
[1:20:10] high priest of our confession Jesus
[1:20:14] Christ there is an apostle to what I
[1:20:16] appreciate there's a high priest of what
[1:20:19] I'm preaching his name is Jesus Christ
[1:20:21] and tonight his blood leaves upon the
[1:20:25] throne of God as a sacrifice for our
[1:20:28] redemption power sitting here tonight
[1:20:31] oh I know the devil don't like it but I
[1:20:35] don't like the devil either we're not
[1:20:39] going to show that devil one ounce of
[1:20:41] mercy
[1:20:42] not one in the armor not one
[1:20:45] spirit of fear not one spirit of
[1:20:47] criticism not one spirit of an eighth
[1:20:49] card to Satan in the name of Jesus
[1:20:52] Christ but truth in authority and the
[1:21:02] power I'll tell you that's a dumb devil
[1:21:05] that's a gunbattle he attacks the wrong
[1:21:08] people at the wrong times
[1:21:11] [Music]
[1:21:16] he's a high priest of our confession Oh
[1:21:22] people so while confessions don't mean
[1:21:24] nothing william branham said he said you
[1:21:28] start confessing something he said you
[1:21:30] start confessing you're a drunk and
[1:21:32] you're a sinner he said you keep up that
[1:21:34] confession you will be he said that's
[1:21:38] the power of confession do you know that
[1:21:40] Jesus can only intercede what you
[1:21:42] confess that he can only pay a payment
[1:21:46] for what you confess think about this he
[1:21:48] can only offer what you're able to
[1:21:50] confess amen now think of this because
[1:21:52] some might say well by the way that's
[1:21:54] good just to say it well look what look
[1:21:56] what happened in our time to prove it
[1:21:58] with blind John ride with blind John
[1:22:02] line coming in the meeting and brother
[1:22:04] Bannon telling him thus saith the Lord
[1:22:06] you're healed right the man left the
[1:22:09] platform blind as a bat
[1:22:11] sat down in the meetings run back up to
[1:22:14] brother branham said I can't see nothing
[1:22:16] brother Branham he said John I thought
[1:22:18] you said you believe me he said I
[1:22:20] thought she said I was healed he said I
[1:22:21] thought you said you believed me he said
[1:22:23] I do believe your brother Brandon but I
[1:22:25] can't see he said what does that have to
[1:22:27] do with it John he said I told you
[1:22:29] you're healed in the name of Jesus he
[1:22:31] said well what do I do brother and he
[1:22:33] said you go testify about your healing
[1:22:36] now John nothing physically changed that
[1:22:40] night the only thing that changed was
[1:22:43] his confession two weeks later the angel
[1:22:48] of the Lord Amen come by when John was
[1:22:52] sitting in a barber chair confessing
[1:22:54] about a healing while he was blind as a
[1:22:57] bat he was just as bad off as he was the
[1:23:00] first night but there was
[1:23:02] to change his face had caught a hold of
[1:23:05] a word and that word was creating
[1:23:08] something hypnotized John said it you
[1:23:12] know what brother Bantam said he said
[1:23:13] even when you start saying it you say it
[1:23:15] even if you don't believe it he said you
[1:23:18] keep saying it - you do believe it
[1:23:21] hey man you just keep saying you've not
[1:23:24] saying a lie
[1:23:25] you're saying the Word of God you keep
[1:23:28] saying it and tell there's something in
[1:23:31] your heart to test us that's the truth
[1:23:33] oh that man knew he come to his healing
[1:23:40] two weeks later
[1:23:41] Amen now if that was Justin brother
[1:23:44] Brandon stay that I'd have to tell that
[1:23:46] with an uncertainty but see I have a
[1:23:48] certainty of the God that I'm serving I
[1:23:50] have had an experience with that God
[1:23:52] this is not a story book this is not a
[1:23:55] painted picture I'm not talking about
[1:23:57] what God used to be I'm talking to you
[1:23:59] about the God that is living right now
[1:24:02] in this building the God that is here in
[1:24:05] supreme power in supreme deity
[1:24:08] we're not playing a game God is God He
[1:24:12] is God above everything every demon in
[1:24:15] every cow
[1:24:18] [Music]
[1:24:21] you see what I found out we don't have
[1:24:24] to have something new but we gotta have
[1:24:26] what God gave us and made real to us and
[1:24:30] then I was sitting in a service one
[1:24:32] night where there was a lady who was
[1:24:33] paralyzed sitting in the surge paralyzed
[1:24:35] of stroke she was paralyzed in one half
[1:24:38] of her body and she would pull around
[1:24:40] like this and she was so under
[1:24:41] condemnation because of her former life
[1:24:43] she didn't even know if God would heal
[1:24:45] her but she come up and talked to me and
[1:24:47] I talked to her about the grace of God
[1:24:49] she had already repented and been in the
[1:24:51] church amen but she's standing up
[1:24:53] paralyzed in that half and I prayed for
[1:24:55] her and I said look sis I'm just a man
[1:24:57] that's nothing brother Wayne can do for
[1:25:00] you I said but I offer the prayer the
[1:25:02] way the Bible said then the Prophet said
[1:25:05] you go testify what God has done for you
[1:25:08] she said well by the way she said my
[1:25:10] daughter's a nurse and every time I pray
[1:25:13] praise God for a healing my body he said
[1:25:16] your you're making a you're making a
[1:25:19] what could you say your you're making a
[1:25:21] mockery because you're you're saying
[1:25:23] you're healed and you're not healed mom
[1:25:25] you're still just as paralyzed as you
[1:25:26] ever was she said my lane I don't want
[1:25:28] them to think that I'm doing something
[1:25:30] wrong I said listen since my Bible said
[1:25:32] let every man's work be alive that this
[1:25:34] won't be true and the prophet of God
[1:25:37] said
[1:25:38] lines he said remember when that when
[1:25:40] them beans was coming up and he poked
[1:25:42] him back down this moment said how you
[1:25:43] doing he said I'm doing all right
[1:25:45] he said somebody said your line brother
[1:25:47] and me said no I'm confessing I tell you
[1:25:50] what when that woman started confessing
[1:25:52] she come back that night y'all know the
[1:25:55] story somebody's hurting she'd come back
[1:25:57] that night limped her way right to the
[1:25:58] front I was I had a mic just like this
[1:26:01] one I stand there with a lollipop mic
[1:26:03] and since she come right to the front
[1:26:05] and I'm thinking in my mind I pray for
[1:26:07] you and I pray again because I believe
[1:26:09] in second chances and third and fourth
[1:26:11] and fifth I pray when you speak times
[1:26:13] she come amen but when she was standing
[1:26:16] there but in my heart I was saying I
[1:26:17] can't help her ain't man only thing I
[1:26:19] can do is pray for her and when I I went
[1:26:22] to lay my hand on her she looked up at
[1:26:23] me kind of funny and she said no no bro
[1:26:25] Lane she said I want to testify I said
[1:26:28] what she said yeah I want to testify God
[1:26:31] heal me this morning she reached up with
[1:26:33] that paralyzed hand and when she went to
[1:26:36] get the mic she got it with that bad
[1:26:38] hand and then hands straightened up and
[1:26:40] that leg stand up and mother she passed
[1:26:42] across that cut for me at work
[1:26:47] [Applause]
[1:26:48] yes God is thought of the heavens he has
[1:26:52] gone to the earth below he is still tall
[1:26:56] he is still Jehovah timer he is still
[1:27:00] doubled arepa he still has the ability
[1:27:02] tonight simple Wayne is that stuff real
[1:27:08] amen I'll tell you it's real God
[1:27:12] revealed his name as Jehovah rafer you
[1:27:17] can't say his name unless you say he's a
[1:27:19] healer watch watch Moses got to Moses
[1:27:25] have to reveal another portion of God
[1:27:26] when in Exodus remember they were
[1:27:28] fighting with the Amalekites and there's
[1:27:30] a big battle going on in the valley and
[1:27:32] Moses said to the people y'all bow down
[1:27:35] and fight but I'll take a couple boys
[1:27:36] and we'll go up on the Mount and
[1:27:38] remember Moses got up on the mountain
[1:27:40] and held his hands up and he watched the
[1:27:43] battle from the mountain and while he
[1:27:45] was watching his hands was high but the
[1:27:47] Bible tells us that every time his hands
[1:27:49] started coming down every time he
[1:27:52] started getting weak the battle would
[1:27:54] turn and go the other way
[1:27:55] now now you can easily see what's
[1:27:58] happening right Amen Moses was the
[1:28:01] banner of how the battle was going
[1:28:03] because the people were fighting on the
[1:28:05] same plane you can't see very far in the
[1:28:08] battle right so your personal battle is
[1:28:10] the way you judge how the whole thing's
[1:28:12] going so if a person was loosened I
[1:28:15] meant or if they were winning instead of
[1:28:18] gauging it by their personal battles
[1:28:20] they would look up on the mountain and
[1:28:22] they'd see how Moses was saying the
[1:28:24] battle was going and however Moses said
[1:28:27] that's the way they fought when Moses
[1:28:29] his hand started coming down they
[1:28:31] started losing courage he bent so the
[1:28:33] man that was with him solid Haman and
[1:28:35] they got one on side the other and they
[1:28:38] lifted up Moses he
[1:28:39] pants and they stood there three of them
[1:28:42] with their hands lifted saying we got a
[1:28:45] victory here and the people started
[1:28:48] fighting that they had never fought
[1:28:50] before
[1:28:54] they called him Jehovah they called him
[1:28:57] to home to Sitka knew Jehovah Nissi
[1:28:59] which is our banner now I tell you it's
[1:29:02] a powerful thing because Moses was only
[1:29:05] a type of Christ amen but when Moses
[1:29:09] died the people went right all right but
[1:29:12] Jesus Christ the Son of God he was a
[1:29:15] prophet like to Moses and when he died
[1:29:18] he died on Calvary's tree and they took
[1:29:21] his hands and they nailed them up on the
[1:29:24] tree so that they could never come down
[1:29:29] anytime you look at Jesus you're gonna
[1:29:32] see victory you've got to look away from
[1:29:38] your personal battle I'm preaching to
[1:29:41] you now you've got to look away you've
[1:29:43] got to look away from your problems in
[1:29:45] your marriages you got to look away from
[1:29:47] the problem in your family you've got to
[1:29:49] look away from the problem in the church
[1:29:51] and look to Calvary and you'll have to
[1:29:54] turn and say we've got victory it's
[1:29:57] victory it's victory oh so maybe it's
[1:30:02] changed in the end no because in
[1:30:05] Revelation still with the mighty angel
[1:30:07] descends out of heaven he still has his
[1:30:10] hands lifted up his hands as in victory
[1:30:13] of the church what is it God is telling
[1:30:16] the church your victory it's not coming
[1:30:19] from you it's coming from him now of
[1:30:26] course there are there's a lot in these
[1:30:30] things but I want to maybe just say this
[1:30:32] that he did he actually built amen he
[1:30:35] actually built an altar and called him
[1:30:37] Jehovah our banner
[1:30:41] he's our banner
[1:30:43] the banner of the church is the old
[1:30:46] rugged cross you see the banner of the
[1:30:49] church as long as you hold that up that
[1:30:51] will be a victory you remember in
[1:30:53] battles how they got a abandoned maker
[1:30:55] or a man who run ahead of the battle and
[1:30:56] it would hold up the American flag or
[1:30:58] the ebrill Jima is one of the major
[1:31:00] things they always tried to take a land
[1:31:03] and then lift the flag and all the
[1:31:06] soldiers fighting would see the flag
[1:31:07] lifted and know exactly is that Roger
[1:31:10] hey man I tell you what there was a
[1:31:12] story one time about of a banner maker
[1:31:14] it meant a man who was running that
[1:31:15] banner amen and somebody hard for
[1:31:18] everybody retreat but he didn't hear so
[1:31:20] he just kept running he kept running and
[1:31:22] after a while he got so far up there
[1:31:24] somebody said to him hey you got to come
[1:31:26] back here where the people are he meant
[1:31:28] any hard back he said no I'm not going
[1:31:31] back to the men you tell the men to move
[1:31:33] up to Araya
[1:31:34] amen and I'll tell you tonight this is
[1:31:37] not a time to go backwards this is a
[1:31:40] time for the church to move up the power
[1:31:43] of God we're not going back we're going
[1:31:47] forward
[1:31:47] [Applause]
[1:31:52] [Music]
[1:31:56] said preacher don't you think with all
[1:31:59] the things going on in the world you are
[1:32:01] to sound a retreat by now listen this
[1:32:03] preacher don't know that sound
[1:32:05] I don't have that in my in my battle
[1:32:08] skills and I never learned the tune of
[1:32:11] retreat that's a trumpet player right he
[1:32:15] tells the church he tells the battle
[1:32:17] words go and how to go amen and you know
[1:32:20] they said one time they had a young
[1:32:22] trumpet ear that had learned part of it
[1:32:24] but they was doing so good I only
[1:32:25] learned was charge and one day they the
[1:32:28] man hollered sing the battle holler back
[1:32:30] said hey hey men sound the retreat and
[1:32:32] the man thought oh man he said well I
[1:32:34] don't know about retreat so he hold for
[1:32:36] the charge amen and the whole group of
[1:32:39] the battle people just begin to move
[1:32:41] into the battle with a charge because of
[1:32:43] some little fella who didn't know any
[1:32:46] better that just to believe we can win
[1:32:48] this fight I might not be a gentleman
[1:32:51] but I know the God that is with us and I
[1:32:54] believe we can win the bag I think with
[1:32:59] I wish that was a trumpet player right
[1:33:01] now I will tell you Church charge
[1:33:04] [Applause]
[1:33:12] [Applause]
[1:33:16] [Music]
[1:33:19] comfortable in this place around here
[1:33:24] [Applause]
[1:33:31] [Applause]
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:41] [Applause]
[1:33:44] [Music]
[1:33:47] you might think I'm crazy and I might be
[1:33:53] but I'm seeing things in the
[1:33:55] supernatural realm that is telling me
[1:33:57] there's more of us than there is theme
[1:34:05] preacher what's your reasoning I don't
[1:34:08] have no reasoning I got the Word of God
[1:34:10] and it said we are more than able to
[1:34:12] take this land we are more than able to
[1:34:15] destroy every devil you're able to stop
[1:34:17] out every disease we're able to tear
[1:34:19] down every wall we are the seed of
[1:34:22] Abraham I've got a different kind of
[1:34:28] banner tonight my banner is not an
[1:34:31] American flag my band is not a European
[1:34:33] flag my banner is the flag of the old
[1:34:36] rugged cross I wished I had one right
[1:34:38] now I'd wave it to you but y'all know
[1:34:41] what this means don't you
[1:34:42] y'all know what this means don't you it
[1:34:45] means devil I'm still here
[1:34:46] you might be fighting but I'm still here
[1:34:50] you might be pressing but I'm still here
[1:34:52] I told the devil get wild back every
[1:34:57] time I preach he told me I'm gonna get
[1:34:59] you and I was just a kid I won't keep
[1:35:00] you I won't destroy ya you're never
[1:35:02] gonna make it
[1:35:03] Amen you know what I figured out after a
[1:35:05] while he wasn't nothin but a lying devil
[1:35:07] and I told that devil you might fight
[1:35:10] remember I got ever right to fight back
[1:35:13] if he's going to use every dirty trick
[1:35:16] he's got I think the church are to use
[1:35:18] every word God give up
[1:35:20] this is not a battle for half the
[1:35:23] message this is a battle for every quote
[1:35:25] that says you're healed
[1:35:27] and the quote that says God is blessing
[1:35:29] you that God has forgiven you that god
[1:35:32] holds nothing against you amen we're not
[1:35:34] coming in the name of a man we're coming
[1:35:37] in the name of the Most High God He is
[1:35:49] God and there is none beside him so by
[1:35:59] the way you're crazy man listen listen
[1:36:02] I've got peace but got peace where I'm
[1:36:07] at because the Lord revealed to Gideon I
[1:36:12] am the god of peace and judges six
[1:36:16] Gideon found out that his name was
[1:36:18] Jehovah his name was Jehovah shallow
[1:36:24] his name is Jehovah shallow
[1:36:27] do you know what Gideon was Gideon was
[1:36:29] facing the greatest battle of his life
[1:36:31] do you know that Gideon Amen God had a
[1:36:34] lot of confidence in him but he didn't
[1:36:35] have any confidence in himself and he
[1:36:39] was living among the media nights which
[1:36:40] means strife he had no ability
[1:36:44] whatsoever to get out of the mess he was
[1:36:46] him that God came to him and said to him
[1:36:48] I have chosen you as a mighty man of
[1:36:50] Valor
[1:36:51] hey man and you're gonna drive out the
[1:36:53] inhabitants of this land he had to have
[1:36:57] four or five confirmations Amen he even
[1:37:01] questioned God himself but when he got
[1:37:06] done when he was sure of the vindicated
[1:37:09] presence of God with him you know what
[1:37:11] he did he build him an altar and he
[1:37:13] worshiped on that altar and called his
[1:37:15] name Jehovah Shalom
[1:37:17] they ended on that he called him the God
[1:37:21] of peace and he never had yet stepped in
[1:37:23] the battle
[1:37:25] amen God gave him peace before he ever
[1:37:28] killed the first Midianite before he
[1:37:31] ever drove out the first one God gave
[1:37:34] him peace and Men the man had peace for
[1:37:37] the battle he meant because God had
[1:37:40] already given him the victory before he
[1:37:43] ever stepped off the platform God gave
[1:37:46] the man peace you said well brother Lane
[1:37:48] how in the world hey man could God give
[1:37:50] a man peace like that he vindicated his
[1:37:51] presence do you see what he done he
[1:37:54] vindicated his presence so God give him
[1:37:56] the name Jehovah Shalom man and he knew
[1:37:58] God as the God of peace that's amazing
[1:38:01] to me because in john 14 jesus said i
[1:38:04] will give you peace he actually says my
[1:38:08] peace I give unto you not as the world
[1:38:11] would give it a mint but I'll leave it
[1:38:14] with you he was going to the cross but
[1:38:18] he had a peace that was coming to the
[1:38:21] church by a word that if the people
[1:38:24] would believe him they would have peace
[1:38:26] in the time of trouble
[1:38:28] listen missus the God of peace that was
[1:38:31] with him amen my mind works like this
[1:38:34] I'm sorry but if I believe if he's God
[1:38:36] in the Bible he was God in Jesus Christ
[1:38:39] amen do y'all know the Bible teaches
[1:38:42] that Jesus got on a boat with a bunch of
[1:38:44] disciples and he said to them cast off
[1:38:46] were going to the other side amen and
[1:38:49] Jesus went down and went to sleep in the
[1:38:51] belly of the boat amen and they took out
[1:38:53] across the sea amen and brother men said
[1:38:56] they actually started discussing how
[1:38:58] that Jesus was that Jehovah and they
[1:39:01] started recognizing the habits that he
[1:39:03] had as the habits of his father and they
[1:39:07] begin to compare them and brother ben
[1:39:09] says watch now 10,000 devils rose up and
[1:39:12] said you're not going to the other side
[1:39:15] 10,000 devils rose up to kill Christ and
[1:39:18] to sink that boat that night but brother
[1:39:21] Brandon said notice this now he meant
[1:39:23] Jesus had already said we're going to
[1:39:26] the other side
[1:39:28] and mending 10,000 Devils is not enough
[1:39:32] to sink a boat when God said you're
[1:39:36] going to the other side Ten Thousand
[1:39:40] Devils rose up that night and said we'll
[1:39:42] sink this boat but that was one God that
[1:39:47] was him that boat that was more powerful
[1:39:50] than ten thousand Devils on that sea
[1:39:54] that night and I'll tell you what they
[1:39:56] did after they got tired of weary and
[1:39:58] and fussing and fearing they went down
[1:40:00] and woke up Jesus and when they woke
[1:40:02] Jesus up he come and stood on the bow of
[1:40:04] the boat amen and Jehovah shall old
[1:40:07] stood in Jesus Christ and he looked at
[1:40:11] the waves and said peace be unto you
[1:40:13] and the God that created the waves and
[1:40:17] the wind began to use only his word only
[1:40:22] his word but his word was coming from
[1:40:26] the lips of the Messiah and he stopped
[1:40:29] the storm in the middle of the trip are
[1:40:33] you hearing me amen
[1:40:35] they was going to the other side didn't
[1:40:37] matter how many devil said they wasn't
[1:40:38] they're going and when God decides
[1:40:42] you're going somewhere it don't matter
[1:40:43] how many devil says you're not going if
[1:40:45] God says you're going
[1:40:48] God told Moses don't get my people and
[1:40:52] come back to this mountain in worship me
[1:40:54] he didn't know about Pharaoh he didn't
[1:40:57] know about the Red Sea he didn't know
[1:40:59] about the troubles he was going to face
[1:41:00] but God had already said you're bringing
[1:41:03] them people back here then it didn't
[1:41:06] matter what got in the way God would
[1:41:09] make it move because they're going to
[1:41:12] the other side now you're gonna be real
[1:41:19] careful because when you get in the hard
[1:41:20] way if you're not careful look at the
[1:41:22] Scourge mental calm and brother band
[1:41:24] said God loves to put you in a hard
[1:41:26] place
[1:41:28] he loves to put you in a hard place
[1:41:30] he said just to see what you're gonna do
[1:41:32] he let the Hebrew children come down to
[1:41:35] the place of shutting the gate before he
[1:41:37] showed up he'd let he willing to see
[1:41:40] what they were going to do he meant he
[1:41:41] put them at the banks of the sea before
[1:41:43] he ever opened the water but brother
[1:41:47] Ryan says when you come to a place then
[1:41:50] it's too high to go over it it's too low
[1:41:53] to get under it it's too wide to get
[1:41:55] around it it's too thick to go through
[1:41:58] it he said that's when God will Lake
[1:42:00] away with every temptation there is a
[1:42:05] way of escape and God says we're going
[1:42:09] through then God's got to make a way for
[1:42:12] us to get proved by hardest things in
[1:42:15] our lives the greatest trials the
[1:42:17] greatest tragedies we've got to get
[1:42:19] through do you see the God the God of
[1:42:22] peace Jehovah Shalom now you don't think
[1:42:26] you quit being God when Jesus died in
[1:42:28] Berryman's robes but Paul actually says
[1:42:31] in Romans 16 and 20 the God of peace
[1:42:33] shall bruise Satan under your feet can
[1:42:38] you imagine the God of peace is planning
[1:42:40] to use you to brew Satan the god of
[1:42:44] peace has planned to use you to stop his
[1:42:47] enemy now I tell you when you start
[1:42:50] thinking about this I know it gets a
[1:42:52] little it gets a little weird and you
[1:42:53] are kind of troubling to a person that's
[1:42:55] thinking about you mean God has decided
[1:42:57] I'm going to walk over his enemy but see
[1:43:00] don't never forget this
[1:43:02] it's a defeated enemy Amen that there is
[1:43:06] a people whom God has anointed to put
[1:43:09] Satan under their feet they meant to
[1:43:13] think tonight that God anoints you to be
[1:43:16] a serpent bruiser he meant that God
[1:43:19] would anoint the church to be a serpent
[1:43:21] bruiser to put Satan under your feet
[1:43:23] because he's the God of peace notice
[1:43:26] this this is the same God William
[1:43:29] Branham was serving when he was up on
[1:43:31] the mountain out in Colorado and a storm
[1:43:34] came a blizzard amen it was gonna shut
[1:43:36] down the hunt brother Brennan said a
[1:43:38] voice said to me go back up on the
[1:43:41] mountain he said go back up into that
[1:43:43] storm hey Ben but when he got up there
[1:43:46] God said to him my voice still calms the
[1:43:50] winds and it still ceases the storms and
[1:43:53] brother back and begin to say storm you
[1:43:55] go back where you come from and son you
[1:43:58] come out and you shine for three days do
[1:44:01] you see what is happening a prophet is
[1:44:03] exhibiting the same God that was in the
[1:44:06] Bible amen to make him a present tense
[1:44:10] God to the church in this last days hey
[1:44:13] man can we take her can we take a little
[1:44:15] time not notice this David found out in
[1:44:18] Psalms 23 he said the Lord is my
[1:44:21] shepherd Amen Jehovah is our Shepherd
[1:44:25] Amen you know who your shepherd is
[1:44:27] tonight God is your Shepherd you see
[1:44:31] what David said the Lord is my shepherd
[1:44:33] hey brother listen if the Lord is your
[1:44:35] Shepherd amen then then so God is
[1:44:38] protecting you tonight amen that just
[1:44:41] has the sheepfold that david protected
[1:44:44] he was saying god is my shield God is
[1:44:48] light buckler God is
[1:44:49] my hiding place he knew he was his
[1:44:53] Shepard now you you think about you
[1:44:56] think about a shepherd a shepherd a man
[1:44:58] who can stand out in the field and call
[1:45:00] the sheep it can tell the Sheep to come
[1:45:03] here and they know the voice of that
[1:45:04] shepherd I don't know if y'all have ever
[1:45:07] seen any videos it's pretty amazing to
[1:45:09] have two men stand out in the whole
[1:45:11] group of a sheep out there in the mantle
[1:45:13] hollering heating the Sheep won't move
[1:45:14] that lets Shepherd calm their kind
[1:45:17] because jesus said my sheep they know my
[1:45:23] voice and a stranger they will not
[1:45:27] follow do you see David knew that kind
[1:45:31] of can you imagine that Jesus sent on a
[1:45:34] regular blazes with Lazarus and Mary and
[1:45:36] Martha and Lazarus become to know the
[1:45:41] voice of Jesus and Jesus was the good
[1:45:45] shepherd he was the door of the
[1:45:48] sheepfold him one day the devil come and
[1:45:51] took the life of Lazarus and Jesus was
[1:45:54] four days away from him and could have
[1:45:56] made it on time but brother Brandon said
[1:45:59] God amen gave him a vision and he let
[1:46:02] him actually pass before he ever went to
[1:46:04] where he was by the time he got there
[1:46:07] you would have thought he was four days
[1:46:08] late but brother Brennan said with
[1:46:11] Martha Menand Amen she wasn't mad at him
[1:46:13] she only said lord if he would have been
[1:46:15] here he wouldn't have died
[1:46:17] Amen but jesus said Martha I am I am the
[1:46:22] resurrection and the life you see I
[1:46:25] thought I was but I will be I am the
[1:46:30] resurrection and the life
[1:46:32] amen and he that believeth in me shall
[1:46:33] never die Martha and Martha said I know
[1:46:36] I know I know he will raise at the last
[1:46:38] day she said he said no Martha go move
[1:46:41] the stone don't move the stone Martha
[1:46:45] brother BAM said you think he couldn't
[1:46:47] have moved that stone with his pinkie
[1:46:50] you don't think he couldn't have just
[1:46:52] brushed that stone away with his pinky
[1:46:55] he said but he let her do it
[1:46:57] to give her a part in the miracle and
[1:47:01] when she rolled back that stove brother
[1:47:04] Brendan said he stood there at the grave
[1:47:06] for days cold the body was already in
[1:47:10] corruption but the Wren said his life is
[1:47:12] four days journey but the master stood
[1:47:15] at the side and said Lazarus come out of
[1:47:19] there and Lazarus was a sheep and
[1:47:23] Jesus's voice touched Lazarus worried
[1:47:27] walk come on church he was down there in
[1:47:29] paradise having a good time with the
[1:47:31] family he had a lot of people over there
[1:47:36] but in the middle of it he heard
[1:47:37] something he said you all hear that
[1:47:39] they said no we didn't hear that he said
[1:47:42] yeah somebody's caught whoa it's the
[1:47:44] master it's the Masters calling it's the
[1:47:49] master he's calling you know the prophet
[1:47:52] of God said he said if he hadn't a said
[1:47:54] Lazarus every one of them would have
[1:47:57] come out of that grave but he called him
[1:47:59] by name because he was proven he was the
[1:48:04] Shepherd of the sheep called Lazarus and
[1:48:07] corruption had to give back his body
[1:48:11] corruption had already run off and God
[1:48:14] said no put it back where you got it hey
[1:48:17] many corruption had to turn around and
[1:48:20] put the body back death had to give up
[1:48:22] the life and God brought him up out of
[1:48:25] that grave and the power of his
[1:48:27] resurrection to prove he wants to hold a
[1:48:29] shower job husha
[1:48:31] the ship of the Lord our Shepherd he
[1:48:34] began to prove to over a halt and when
[1:48:36] he began to prove that what's now amen
[1:48:38] he proved that with him showing I am
[1:48:40] actually the Shepherd of the people
[1:48:43] nothing's going to come unless he lets
[1:48:46] it do you see because watch now anytime
[1:48:49] something comes and gets a sheep who
[1:48:53] goes after it the Shepherd and David
[1:48:58] knew that the Lord was his shepherd and
[1:49:01] he said you hide my soul in hell make my
[1:49:04] bed in hell he'll find me there it
[1:49:08] doesn't matter where you put me amen you
[1:49:10] can't put me out of his reach he knew he
[1:49:14] was his Shepherd yeah now I'm talking
[1:49:16] about the God that I'm serving here
[1:49:18] tonight not the god of history
[1:49:20] he was the Shepherd of David insolence
[1:49:23] that David acted like his master he was
[1:49:28] an amateur Shepherd and one day a lion
[1:49:30] coming down a sheep one day a line
[1:49:34] coming down his sheep and you know what
[1:49:35] he wouldn't do he wouldn't just let it
[1:49:37] go
[1:49:38] he was just a little faith he didn't
[1:49:41] have no ability he wasn't a lawyer he
[1:49:44] was a boy Amen he was a singer and
[1:49:47] a shepherd he wasn't a warrior Amen but
[1:49:50] he stood there and saw that's my daddy
[1:49:52] sheep amen and they have come and took
[1:49:55] it and he went after that line I'll tell
[1:49:57] you what I just read a quote last night
[1:49:59] brother mem said this he said David
[1:50:01] didn't know how he would get it back
[1:50:03] he just knew he was going after he
[1:50:06] didn't know what weapon he would use he
[1:50:08] didn't know how he would kill a line but
[1:50:10] he was going after it because it was his
[1:50:13] job to go after it and you know what he
[1:50:15] found out when he come to the challenge
[1:50:17] that was an anointing on him and he
[1:50:20] slayed that line like it was a little
[1:50:22] kitten not because of his might not
[1:50:25] because of his power he was operating
[1:50:28] under the office a man that he was a
[1:50:30] shepherd under the office of God Oh
[1:50:36] Church of the Living God amen you see
[1:50:38] God didn't change his mind because a few
[1:50:41] days later a bear a bear coming down a
[1:50:44] little sheep amen and David didn't just
[1:50:47] say it's just one sheep it's just one
[1:50:50] little sheep David didn't have that
[1:50:51] heart because his father didn't have
[1:50:53] that heart and David said I can't lose
[1:50:55] one of them and he took off after that
[1:50:58] bear like it was just a little cow amen
[1:51:00] he took off after that bear not knowing
[1:51:02] how he would do it are you hearing me he
[1:51:06] didn't know how he would kill no prayer
[1:51:08] but he knew this bears gotta die because
[1:51:11] that's God's sheep he's got a hold up
[1:51:15] and when he went to do the job that was
[1:51:18] an anointing setting on him amen the God
[1:51:21] of Abraham setting around him the God
[1:51:23] that was able to change things settle
[1:51:25] around him and he killed that bear and
[1:51:30] he walked away from there with a couple
[1:51:32] experiences in him and a few days later
[1:51:35] he went to pull him out and an entire
[1:51:37] camp was setting in fear and he looked
[1:51:40] around and saw the King Saul sitting
[1:51:42] there and saw the army and he looked
[1:51:44] around there and they all said Oh David
[1:51:46] you're up here trying to make you know
[1:51:47] you're just up here getting into trouble
[1:51:49] and David went over and began to tell
[1:51:51] about his experience with God he began
[1:51:54] to tell about his experience was with
[1:51:55] God and he happened to be standing there
[1:51:58] winged alive come out and said hey man
[1:52:00] send over somebody to fight amen and the
[1:52:03] littlest guy the littlest guy in the
[1:52:06] army
[1:52:07] the littlest guy in the camp of Israel
[1:52:09] he wasn't even in the army he happened
[1:52:13] to hear that --gel I say Amen that he
[1:52:16] can whip the camp of Israel and that
[1:52:18] little fella said look if my God will
[1:52:21] kill align and kill a bear over a sheep
[1:52:24] who is his son circumcised Philistine
[1:52:27] who thinks he can defy the armies of the
[1:52:29] Living God there was something rose up
[1:52:33] hitting he didn't know how he would kill
[1:52:35] a Goliath he didn't know how he would
[1:52:37] kill a child but he knew this he was
[1:52:39] gonna die trying he knew he would face
[1:52:42] that thing he would face it toe to toe
[1:52:47] brother van and said I'm gonna take
[1:52:49] David's place tonight
[1:52:50] he said listen God's got some sheep out
[1:52:53] here and he started naming the problems
[1:52:55] in their lives and he said God hey I
[1:52:57] don't know how I'm gonna do it but I'm
[1:52:59] gonna throw a rock at it I'm gonna throw
[1:53:02] a stone at it come on church you know
[1:53:06] the story it's a it's a simple story
[1:53:08] remember but you know what David knew
[1:53:11] God was the shepherd and David went down
[1:53:14] there and heard Goliath and he actually
[1:53:16] took a life he said look now ghal I said
[1:53:19] I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna cut your
[1:53:21] head off and I'm gonna feed you to the
[1:53:22] birds you're just a kid you've got no
[1:53:25] right challenging me amen but David knew
[1:53:28] whose seed he was he was at the seed of
[1:53:31] Abraham and every time to life cursed
[1:53:33] him but curse was going right back up
[1:53:37] holy they meant so I imagine he said go
[1:53:40] ahead Goliath run your mouth some more
[1:53:42] because everything you're saying it's
[1:53:45] only building me a weapon to tear you
[1:53:47] down
[1:53:49] because now you're not coming against me
[1:53:52] as a person you're coming against the
[1:53:54] God that I serve amen and the Bible said
[1:53:57] he that blesses you shall be blessed and
[1:54:00] he that curses you shall be cursed and
[1:54:03] that Goliath began to curse God's
[1:54:05] anointed amen and look look what he done
[1:54:08] David went down there and got anointed a
[1:54:11] mint and run down to the brook and found
[1:54:13] five smooth stones yeah yeah now y'all

[2:02:17] the name of the city from that day shall
[2:02:19] be the Lord is there and this is where

[2:02:30] there amen let me say we just meet he is
[2:02:34] ever-present he's actually there I mean
[2:02:36] what good would it be for him to be the
[2:02:39] shepherd if the shepherd ain't here what
[2:02:41] good would it be to you if the inner
[2:02:43] wasn't here what good would it be for
[2:02:45] deliverer if the deliverer wasn't here
[2:02:46] what good would a miracle work at me if
[2:02:48] he wasn't here but our God is also known
[2:02:51] as jehova shamma in other words he is
[2:02:54] here now listen he's right here in this
[2:02:58] building right now he said yet a little
[2:03:01] while and the world shall see me no more
[2:03:04] but you shall see me for I will be with
[2:03:08] you even in you until the end of the age
[2:03:11] Amen he is our God and he is here right
[2:03:15] laughs Amen he is not coming on the
[2:03:20] scene he is right now in this building
[2:03:24] he is right here right now you say
[2:03:27] preacher where is he he's in the
[2:03:29] tabernacle of the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:03:33] and the prophet of God said he's right
[2:03:35] here right now tabernacled in a body
[2:03:40] now you say what are you trying to say
[2:03:43] I'm trying to say that our God our Lord
[2:03:45] our Jesus is right here in this place
[2:03:48] right now
[2:03:49] now you say Amen you know I can't
[2:03:53] remember all these names I can't either
[2:03:54] I had to write them down actually but do
[2:03:58] you know in the middle of this Bible God
[2:04:01] doesn't something wonderful all this and
[2:04:03] he actually caused Mary to have a child
[2:04:05] and he changed God changed his name from
[2:04:13] Jehovah to Jesus so every time you say
[2:04:20] the name Jesus
[2:04:22] you have invoked every power that is
[2:04:26] tied to the name of God you can't save
[2:04:30] Jesus without calling a healer on the
[2:04:33] scene you can't say Jesus without having
[2:04:36] to deliver on the scene if you say Jesus
[2:04:39] you see every redemptive name is tied up
[2:04:43] in that name Jesus
[2:04:45] see that's why when you say Jesus it
[2:04:48] means Jehovah Savior amen do you see
[2:04:51] what it is his name Jesus is Jehovah
[2:04:53] Jireh Jehovah Savior now the importance
[2:04:57] of this name of course the first time
[2:04:58] that it was ever spoken human lives Amen
[2:05:02] John actually leapt for joy in the womb
[2:05:05] of his mother a baby who was in the womb
[2:05:12] without any movement amen a baby dead in
[2:05:17] the womb no movement for six months but
[2:05:20] under one name the name of Jesus Mary
[2:05:25] said he jumped for joy within me you
[2:05:29] said what are you talking about preacher
[2:05:31] I say John was the first shatter of the
[2:05:34] New Testament the name Jesus was so
[2:05:39] powerful even the babies in the womb had
[2:05:42] to rejoice at the sound of that name
[2:05:45] because they knew now healing and
[2:05:47] salvation and deliverance and anointing
[2:05:50] was coming upon the earth in that name
[2:05:52] in the precious name of Jesus Christ you
[2:05:55] see that name of Jesus has power and you
[2:06:01] can't tell me I don't have power
[2:06:04] you know I haven't haven't I happen to
[2:06:07] have the the blessing not kids you could
[2:06:09] say of having in the last six seven
[2:06:11] years been real close to brother Ron and
[2:06:13] the family here and and brother Pruett
[2:06:15] down in Louisiana and brother Ron I've
[2:06:18] shared a lot of meetings together and
[2:06:19] you know what we've whipped a lot of
[2:06:21] devils together I guarantee you if you
[2:06:26] go down to hell they know the name I bet
[2:06:30] you don't have to say it twice you say
[2:06:32] Ron Spencer they know who you're talking
[2:06:34] about we were together in a meeting last
[2:06:39] year and in the fall in October on a
[2:06:42] Saturday morning and I'd already come
[2:06:44] out and set on the platform and in a
[2:06:46] minute brother Ron brother Tim come out
[2:06:47] and sat down and brother Michael Dexter
[2:06:49] I think was leading songs that morning
[2:06:50] and he began to tell a testimony about a
[2:06:53] bunch of about some people that was on a
[2:06:55] boat with brother Branham and they were
[2:06:57] going down a river y'all remember the
[2:06:58] testimony they're going down the river
[2:07:00] and they hit a bought it was a log amen
[2:07:03] and then the couple thought it was a log
[2:07:04] and after they hit the bump but the
[2:07:06] brown was telling them I think they were
[2:07:07] bearing with me on the couple on the
[2:07:08] boat and they were bearing and and the
[2:07:11] Prophet told them said no that wasn't
[2:07:13] the log you bumped into that was
[2:07:15] actually an angel and he was coming to
[2:07:18] bring to pass your prayer that you
[2:07:21] wanted to have a child
[2:07:22] mr. Baris was gonna leave you when they
[2:07:24] said that man was a presence come on
[2:07:26] that platform and brother on me elbow
[2:07:28] brother Tim they was all talking back
[2:07:30] and forth
[2:07:31] I knew it's good I could feel it if I
[2:07:34] said that's good I don't know what hours
[2:07:36] later so at the end the service we get
[2:07:39] on the back and brother on Sabri Lane
[2:07:41] the angel the Lord met me in the
[2:07:43] bathroom said the angel the presence of
[2:07:45] God was back there and told me that
[2:07:47] tonight was Esther's night and sister
[2:07:50] Esther
[2:07:50] but the Tim's daughter been married 16
[2:07:53] years has been has been looking for a
[2:07:55] baby been desired to have a child have
[2:07:57] been praying and asking God for 16 years
[2:08:00] well in that meeting brother Ron said
[2:08:02] well Amy said tonight is Esther's night
[2:08:03] and we had a prayer line this alone
[2:08:06] prayer line and Bella Ron he was right
[2:08:07] there he was praying he was praying and
[2:08:09] just as soon as Esther come through the
[2:08:11] line he turned around and left and
[2:08:12] brother agen actually asked me said what
[2:08:14] take brother Ron's place and so we
[2:08:16] continued the prayer line but he was
[2:08:17] finished because he was been standing
[2:08:19] there waiting on Esther that whole time
[2:08:22] well you do y'all know that that was a
[2:08:25] solid year and what four months now a
[2:08:28] year and four months we'll all Wednesday
[2:08:30] night they announced down in Louisiana
[2:08:31] that sister Esther and brother is
[2:08:34] actually expecting a baby now
[2:08:37] [Applause]
[2:08:45] do you know God could have given that
[2:08:48] baby a year ago but why do you think God
[2:08:52] would waiting here in four months to
[2:08:55] show you a miracle working God right in
[2:08:58] the middle of this great trial to let
[2:09:00] you know this didn't sneak up on God but
[2:09:03] God knew this was coming and designed
[2:09:06] the miracle right in the middle of it to
[2:09:08] tell y'all amen I am steel God
[2:09:17] he's still gone I'm not I'm not a crazy
[2:09:25] man I was preaching one time in the
[2:09:27] service
[2:09:27] amen I'm preaching away and I start
[2:09:30] talking about a woman and I said look
[2:09:31] sister I don't care what you've done I
[2:09:34] don't care what I don't care what the
[2:09:35] problem is or something of that nature
[2:09:37] and I said your body might not want to
[2:09:39] have a baby
[2:09:40] Amen but God changed Sarah's body to
[2:09:43] have a baby hey Ben God changed the very
[2:09:46] body of Sarah so she could conceive and
[2:09:49] have a child and I thought it was
[2:09:50] strange when I said it but about a year
[2:09:52] later nearly Bryce Collins and his wife
[2:09:55] Stephanie comes down to Arkansas and
[2:09:57] stiff Stephanie walks up with a baby and
[2:09:59] said brother Lane here's that baby you
[2:10:00] said I could have I said I didn't know I
[2:10:03] even said that she said you told me that
[2:10:06] God can even change my inner body that I
[2:10:08] could have another baby and she said I
[2:10:10] took it as a word of the Lord
[2:10:12] uess what are you saying I'm saying God
[2:10:14] is still God I'm saying that miracle
[2:10:17] working God is right here in this
[2:10:19] building right now he is the God of
[2:10:26] Abraham of God of Isaac and the John of
[2:10:28] Jacob and he has given to you the name
[2:10:31] of Jesus Christ he's given to you to use
[2:10:34] that name of Jesus Christ before every
[2:10:37] trial before every problem that you meet
[2:10:39] you have the name of Jesus now you got
[2:10:42] to think about that name tonight that
[2:10:44] name of Jesus he meant it is as the very
[2:10:47] rod that was in the hand of Moses when
[2:10:50] Moses held up that rod oceans moved when
[2:10:55] Moses held up that rod rocks give out
[2:10:58] water when Moses held up that rod amen
[2:11:02] manna rained out of the heavens when
[2:11:04] Moses held up that rod things begin to
[2:11:07] happen because there was something in
[2:11:10] that rod that had been given to Moses
[2:11:13] for the deliverance of God's people and
[2:11:15] tonight God didn't give you a rod he
[2:11:18] gave you the name of Jesus Christ
[2:11:22] you can raise up that name in front of
[2:11:25] every Red Sea in front of every parent
[2:11:28] moon in front of every sick body and for
[2:11:31] the beverage problem in your marriage
[2:11:32] and say Satan in the name of Jesus
[2:11:37] Christ do you see there is an authority
[2:11:44] in that name now there's a story told of
[2:11:49] David Livingstone closed very quickly as
[2:11:51] a story told the David Livingstone in
[2:11:53] the Bible or in the history books when
[2:11:55] David Livingstone went to Italy Africa
[2:11:56] and he was going to be a missionary he
[2:11:59] knew that he couldn't make it through
[2:12:00] Africa alive because of all the tribes
[2:12:03] but God gave that man enough wisdom to
[2:12:06] go to a certain tribe and he made a made
[2:12:08] a covenant with one of the high priests
[2:12:10] in that in Africa and when he did he
[2:12:13] made a blood covenant with him and they
[2:12:15] had this exchange tokens and when they
[2:12:17] did the priests the the African tribe
[2:12:20] leader chief told him said I want that
[2:12:22] white coach away so David Livingstone
[2:12:24] gave him his white coat and he said look
[2:12:26] mr. Livingstone you can get anything
[2:12:28] I've got you can have it he said well
[2:12:30] what I want is that sacred spear you
[2:12:32] carry so David got that sacred spear and
[2:12:36] kept it in his hand and then when he
[2:12:38] begin to travel Africa and he would come
[2:12:41] up to a to a tribe that was warrior
[2:12:45] tribes when he started your approaches a
[2:12:47] white man they'd come out of one and
[2:12:48] kill him well all he would do was hold
[2:12:50] up that spirit well when he held up that
[2:12:53] spear it spoke that there's a covenant
[2:12:56] with one of their kings and they had to
[2:12:58] honor that covenant because he was in
[2:13:01] possession of that spirit the Church of
[2:13:04] the Living God is in a covenant with
[2:13:07] Almighty God and God has given you the
[2:13:10] name of Jesus Christ and when the devil
[2:13:13] comes all you have to do is hold up that
[2:13:16] name and
[2:13:18] Satan comes in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:13:22] do you see what it is it's a power over
[2:13:25] and ever devil because there is no name
[2:13:27] above the name of Jesus Christ listen
[2:13:30] tonight we could stand here and we could
[2:13:32] name every name in the Bible but there
[2:13:34] is no name like the name of Jesus we can
[2:13:37] name Paul we can name change we can name
[2:13:39] John we can name Peter we can make Moses
[2:13:42] Abraham whoever they are but nobody's
[2:13:45] like that name Jesus come on church a
[2:13:48] ment but if that be true about God's
[2:13:50] people how much greater then it's the
[2:13:53] name of Jesus Christ that every devil
[2:13:56] you can name whatever devil you can name
[2:13:59] Jesus Christ is above that devil tonight
[2:14:03] and that devil is under your feet I
[2:14:09] don't know how we're gonna do it but
[2:14:11] I'll tell you this you gotta ride
[2:14:13] tonight to charge every devil in hell
[2:14:15] and say Satan you're in my way I'm a
[2:14:19] child of God and I'm coming after you oh
[2:14:25] my because your God is God
[2:14:33] your God He is God it said brother Wayne
[2:14:41] man I think you're getting us in trouble
[2:14:43] I think you're building a bunch of false
[2:14:48] hope I think you're getting us in
[2:14:49] trouble
[2:14:52] do you know that's what Georgie Carter's
[2:14:55] mom told brother branham said you know
[2:14:59] what you're doing you're coming around
[2:15:01] here building this girl up a false hope
[2:15:03] and you know what her hope wasn't false
[2:15:05] her hope was building a name and it was
[2:15:10] not the name of William Branham her hope
[2:15:12] was built in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:15:14] because she had read in her Bible that
[2:15:17] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[2:15:20] and forever that was a little girl who
[2:15:23] laid nine years on the bed nine years
[2:15:28] she laid on the bed but she heard about
[2:15:30] the miracle working God who was working
[2:15:33] miracles through William branham's
[2:15:35] ministry and she began to pray that that
[2:15:37] God would send the man to her house who
[2:15:40] would pray over her and her mother
[2:15:42] thought she was crazy she wasn't crazy
[2:15:45] she was Abraham's seed still remain to
[2:15:50] be gone he's the thought that controls
[2:15:52] the the law y'all know the story
[2:15:58] brother man was out in solid vision that
[2:16:02] maybe getting up and walking and when he
[2:16:04] started off to Georgie's house and come
[2:16:06] knocking her mama actually was praying
[2:16:09] that that imposter would go away that
[2:16:12] that man would move and she seen the
[2:16:14] shadow come across the wall and it was a
[2:16:16] prophet he was being led by Jesus Christ
[2:16:19] and all of a sudden and not come at the
[2:16:21] door and there brother Branham was at
[2:16:23] her door and when she went in there she
[2:16:25] realized that Jesus had led that man
[2:16:27] there and he come up to that bed a
[2:16:30] hopeless case a troubled case there was
[2:16:32] no way it could happen after nine years
[2:16:35] how could this change I'm preaching to
[2:16:39] you some of you've got troubles you've
[2:16:42] been holding a long time
[2:16:43] that's been situations how could he
[2:16:45] change after nine solid years but a
[2:16:48] profit by vision a profit by vision
[2:16:52] since said little Georgie rise above
[2:16:55] that bed and the prophet of God said she
[2:16:59] turned over and put her little feet on
[2:17:02] the ground and she stood up by the power
[2:17:07] of Jesus Christ she didn't stand by her
[2:17:11] own power she stood by the power of
[2:17:13] Jesus Christ that was the power in her
[2:17:16] that allowed her to stand in an hour
[2:17:19] when there was no hope now I don't know
[2:17:25] how much you've studied Georgie Carter
[2:17:27] it's a powerful story though because you
[2:17:30] know what brother Ram said she done
[2:17:32] immediately when she was healed she
[2:17:35] jumped over on that piano and started
[2:17:37] playing she jumped over and started
[2:17:42] playing that piano and she started
[2:17:43] worshipping God what was going on over
[2:17:45] there you know you know what really was
[2:17:47] happening brother Branham said that's
[2:17:49] what she was doing before she got in
[2:17:51] that shape she was actually on her way
[2:17:54] to a piano lesson when her uncle raped
[2:17:56] her and put her in that condition and
[2:17:59] caused TB by the abuse she had had but
[2:18:01] when the name of Jesus come on amen he
[2:18:04] didn't only cause her to walk again
[2:18:06] he took away the crippled nosov that
[2:18:08] abuse that had been in her life and she
[2:18:10] went back to living the life she was
[2:18:12] meant to live let me tell you that
[2:18:14] Devils come by to abused you and
[2:18:17] you but in the name of Jesus Christ it's
[2:18:21] time for the church
[2:18:22] they meant to stand and say Satan you
[2:18:25] careless in the house of God you can't
[2:18:28] hold us maybe you're sitting here
[2:18:32] tonight the problems in your life they
[2:18:34] meant situations as we know you said I
[2:18:36] don't know how it still not happen

[2:18:44] me you go get me sheep you go get my
[2:18:46] sheep that's all I know go get the sheep

[2:18:54] God to cause Georgie to walk it's up to
[2:18:56] God to st. souls and fill them with the

[2:19:21] got no place in here as the authority as
[2:19:24] a commission that son of God Satan I
[2:19:27] charge you to leave this building

[2:19:39] now y'all I tell you just preaching this
[2:19:44] if you think it's not much but let me
[2:19:45] take this right over here in Virginia I
[2:19:48] was preaching one day just like this and
[2:19:51] it was a man jumped up he's sitting
[2:19:53] about where you are a man jumped up and
[2:19:55] he said brother Lawson he said I can't
[2:19:57] help it I got to testify he said the
[2:19:59] cancer has just dropped off of my body I
[2:20:04] never touched it but by the power of the
[2:20:10] preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[2:20:13] that cancer died but in the middle of
[2:20:16] the service
[2:20:17] my wife's granddaddy was sitting about
[2:20:19] where you are in a service and heard a
[2:20:21] man testifying how God can heal and he
[2:20:24] was sitting over the skin cancer on his
[2:20:26] arm
[2:20:26] and when the man said God still heals
[2:20:28] cancer the cancer fell off in the floor
[2:20:30] right in the middle of the church you're
[2:20:34] living in a season or anything as
[2:20:37] possible at any moment in any time the
[2:20:40] God that were serving he's able to do
[2:20:43] anything at all that he's so desires
[2:20:46] [Applause]
[2:20:50] do you know God still raises the dead
[2:20:54] you ken Boyer come here and testify
[2:20:58] didn't he
[2:20:59] I was on the other end of that testimony
[2:21:02] and one of God's servants was laying
[2:21:04] there drawing his last breath
[2:21:06] my son was standing there and his son
[2:21:09] was there and his Deacon was there and I
[2:21:12] simply reached over and put my hand on
[2:21:14] him and I said father this is a pastor
[2:21:17] his church needs him in the name of
[2:21:20] Jesus Christ would you touch the man and
[2:21:22] give him his life and he stood up off
[2:21:25] the ground and begin to worship God my
[2:21:30] son went on to be an RN you know when he

[2:21:53] some months he said I've yet to bring
[2:21:55] one back to life it jumped up and
[2:21:57] started worshipping God he said but when
