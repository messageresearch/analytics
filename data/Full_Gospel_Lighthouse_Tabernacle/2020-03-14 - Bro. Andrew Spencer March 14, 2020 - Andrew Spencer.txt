trying to use a little common sense here during this time here that we're doing here so we're gonna take the offering and we're going on put the offering out here at the front and we're gonna ask you to go row by row and bring your offering down that way we ain't gonna pass it out through the audience just I mean it's trying to use some common sense here you know I know it worked we've been hearing this for 27 years it's not something new for us you know is washing hands for 20 seconds you know and that's what we do at work you know so and then I use common sense when I'm out in the world I go to places there's people here that you know that that their immune system maybe not brother Samuel for instance they wanted him to stay home tonight but he wanted to be in a church so he stayed back there because he don't want to be mingling with people shaking her hands bunk so you know over the next few weeks this thing something that exists a few weeks do we get through these critical times maybe it's nothing maybe it is we don't know but we're going to use some common sense during this time so you know just fist ball people we don't need to shake their hands for this time being so we just we try to use the you know that's the biggest thing we don't want to panic it work they say stay calm wash your hands and don't panic that's what that's what we've been hearing it works I mean we use the same what if I go to Walmart for go to ace if I go to the dollar store to go to the food line I'm using the same same thing there you know I might be reaching up and grabbing the doorknob with one finger but now I'm just trying to use some common sense here you know I'm not I'm not scared I don't have a fear it's thinking I'm not losing sleep but but on the other hand I'm just trying to use a little bit of common sense here so as we take the offering up if we can just go row by row and bring it down and and that way maybe if you can't get down wave your hand hand it to a little kid they'll be more than glad to bring it down for you thank you sister Anna would you have a special song that she could sing and then after her brother John do would you sing for us you took a stone to kill a giant took a staff to part the sea and only you can do so much with hoarding airy themes took us lame to tame a lion you took her off to make a sweet and all nearby cheers a shepherd boy to be a king [Music] don't have to be the strongest cuz you are perfect in Maui if you can move a mountain with faith like a grain of a mustard seed I wonder but here could you with me

Lord a big hand amen praise the Lord and the Holy Ghost in you brought you to the house of God to receive the word of the Lord that he's got to speak to us because the Lord gave brother Andrew is something that we need they gave him something that you need and he gave him something that I need so we need to prepare our hearts and get in the condition to pull on the gift of God and receive exactly what was for you be selfish with it God has something for you brother Josh and he's put something on his servant's heart to speak so now God give us a faith to reach out and grab it God opened the eyes of our heart God opened the eyes of our understanding to receive what he asked for us amen the thing that opened the eyes of my heart Lord granted Lord Jesus amen my heart [Music] ah [Music] yeah [Music] it's time [Music] as we sing [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hi [Applause] [Music] [Music] what to say [Music] amen if the cherubims of God can just day and night they cry holy holy holy into the Lord how much more his redeemed people they don't know anything about redemption like you and I do how much more shall we cry holy holy holy now just with our lips but with our lives in our walk amen as we get ready to turn the service to brother Andrew listening of the song I am nothing without you we're nothing without him if there's any good thing about us it's him that's all [Music] my [Music] I [Music] ah ah ah Oh Oh with you think of this right here take my body [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] ring [Music] I am NOT I [Music] [Applause] [Music] but [Music] this [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Music] or without you let's again take my time or to take my time here on this earth let glorify [Music] I oh my soul [Music] Oh to cover Hey [Music] that's what we want the world to see this heal we don't want them looking at us cuz we can all point to all of our failures all our mistakes and every time you point to Jesus he point to perfection that's where we look to denied and all of the chaos of the world we look to Jesus because in him is perfection in him is truth and man we're just grateful to be in that truth abiding and that truth living in that truth what a day that we're living in what a day that we're living in man we we thank you for praying for brother on this week he's at home streaming with us this evening and here with us in spirit and so we just thank you for praying for him he's at home and knowing well he's been battling just getting his strength back but it's coming and every day he gets farther away from that surgery he just gets stronger and and I thank you for letting me guard him and take care of him I'd do the same exact thing for you and so thank you for letting me do that that's our pastor and I want to guard him with everything that's within me and because I don't want his shoes none too soon and so I believe God's got big things for brother ons ministry and I believe that all the things that we are seeing are just just a little bit on what we're seeing on the surface I believe as it was spoke over brother Justin that you're at the tip of the iceberg and I believe I believe that that we are watching a miracle inside miracles on top of miracles that are coming from this testimony and and I'm just thinking the Lord that we're a part of this and so just don't miss what's going on and don't miss what's taking place in front of you and this whole thing that is going on with the corona virus don't let that scare you to death there's something way worse than that out there and so you just don't be afraid of those things but you trust in Jesus and he'll get you through hand sanitizer totally paper soap and all those things you know the world's got those things but we got blood we got a blood that covers all of our sins all of our sicknesses and we're just thankful to have a God that cares for us and I believe in being smart as well amen is that okay of everybody I know it's I know it's our human habit to shake everybody's hands but you know fur till these things settle down let's just let's just salute the Brethren as Paul taught us to do and sister Anna sent something this week if today said if the pastor says tap your neighbors said watch out I may hit you if it's Tamborine be watching for tambourines back here so but we just love the Lord with all in our hearts and we're looking to the coming of the Lord these things are just signposts to us yeah these things are signposts to us that we're right at the door so let's be ready amen and then if you have your Bibles this evening we'll turn over to the book of first Thessalonians chapter 5 and in verse 1 I'd like to I told you last weekend that I'd be speaking to you on God is with us in the fight and so before we go to that thought I'd like to speak to you on and God is with us so we should have no fear no fear to go into the fight and man first first Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 1 man we remember him brother Matthew tonight he had to work and so just pray the Lord minister to him thank you brother William for stepping in on the way him does such a wonderful job I know he's always happy when brother Matthew gets back to his post of duty but I sure appreciate brother William does a fine job for us hey man hey man let's speak to the author of the word this evening Heavenly Father we come to you tonight Lord and we unite our faith together father just to reach out and touch you one more time Lord Jesus we know that you're passing by this way in so we want to be ever so mindful father Lord that blind Bartimaeus could cry out the son of David have mercy upon me father sitting in that condition father what about us as your children father that have our eyesight Lord not just natural but a spiritual eyesight to see that you're passing by this way tonight Lord I pray that that we would just reach out and touch you as you're gone that would fast my father the Lord may you dismissed her to us in every detail of our life father Lord we know that this world is in a chaotic condition just now the father of the world has been on fire as it were for quite some time father and here we are at the closing of time and the blending of eternity father and your children know exactly where they're standing at his sons and daughters of God and so we just pray father that you would instruct us in the way that we should go father I pray that your spirit would come and minister to us come behind it with a name and father touch our lives heal the sick mind up the brokenhearted father set the captives free and Nord will be careful to serve you and give you glory and honor and praise in Jesus name Amen 1st Thessalonians 5 and 1 but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety when they say I'll say peace and firmness peace and certainty peace and security security from enemies security from dangerous securities from weapons jerm jerm weapons when they say those things then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and of love for a helmet the hope of salvation for God has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we are whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as he also do may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord 1st Peter 5 and 7 tells us to cast all your care upon him for he careth for you he cares to you care verse 8 be sober be vigilant because our adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world I love what what Paul tells us here in 1st Thessalonians 5 and 9 that God had not appointed us to wrath that that God has not predetermined our path that we would be destroyed or experience wrath God's not destined us to go through go through tribulation but God has destined us to go through a rapture God has not destined us to be beaten he is not destined us to be scores he is destined us for a body change there have been those that went through the dark ages that went through persecution but the bride does not go through persecution but we know that these things that we are watching these things are to be but we know that we don't have to fear what we are facing in this fight we don't have to fear what the world is going through we don't have to fear because the bride knows exactly where she's living at she knows where she's standing at she knows what she's facing more or less she knows the gods on her side so she don't have to fear you see if God's on your side what do you have to fear in life you know a lot of times we get caught up in the chaos of humanity and get caught up with the media of the world but we don't have to fear what is being displayed in front of us but I only fear the one that can take away this life and that is not Satan Satan cannot touch one hair of my head until God gets permission of him but I fear the Lord but we know that that is the beginning of wisdom but we look here and we see that God's not appointed us or he's not destined us to go through wrath or or with all the professional ease of life and the de-stresses of life that's not where God wants us to be God does not want us living down in the valley he was just living in the spot that he put us that we would be in it's just like the children of Israel when they were going through when they were going through the wilderness now that's not the spot that God wanted them to be at but that's the spot of the journey that they had to go through and there's many times that if you don't go through these battles and you don't go through these things you don't appreciate the land once you get there but I'd say this tonight that God is such a God of contrasts that we can look and we can appreciate health because we win through sickness we can understand love because we've dealt with hatred we can understand the God of heaven because we've lived with the god of this evil age we've lived we in Satan seated when we've been under attack after attack time and time again but there's always been one focal point there's always been one thing that we can keep our eyes on then the world is changing the stock market's changing the clay they create the crisis of the world has changed it it'll be a new thing next year but God has not changed sicknesses have came but God didn't change kingdoms have came and they went away but God ain't change if there's one thing that we as the people of God should be looking to it's to none other than thus saith the Lord the further we go in this world and the further we step into these things it proves to me that this message is right the further we get into this battle the more it proves that this is none other than Jesus Christ that this is not another message but this is the message of this hour that will change our bodies the more we go through these things this message is proven and vindicated and alive when you'd hear a prophet telling us that that in the last days that there would be germ warfare and these things that we're facing but then you would hear the prophets say that's God lost control or is he allowing just another agency or is he permitting another agency to control it he said but the truth of this question is is that there's two opposing spirits that's in the world at the war today and one of them is God's Holy Spirit and the other one is the devil spirit that is working in deception and the Prophet said that the people of the earth are now making their choice these things that we are seeing these things that we are facing there's a people that's making a choice there's a people that are making a decision where they're gonna stand that are you with me tonight Church there's of people that's making a stand if a voice said let's stand there's a people that's getting behind that voice and said if you stand I stand we're behind him with everything that's within us [Applause] hallelujah these things were seen and Layana cm and make us lazy they wear us how they tear us apart but oh how it makes us long for a city whose builder and maker is God I tell you the more I see in this world the less I want to see in this world and the more I wanna see of that world hello sir my the more I see of Laodicea the more it makes me want to have a faith for a body change the more I see sickness come the more I see death club the more I see formal folk it makes me realize that takes me out of this body and it's going to be the message just meow this message has given you're fake for a body trade class that we feel when we have been given the greatest weapon we've been given prayer we've been given the lord we've been given a committal to God why should we fear when Satan couldn't stand against this message when the Prophet was here how much more can he stand against said he cannot overcome us people may come and go they may need me discombobulated in their thoughts in confusion and different things and but they say that God changed God ain't change the message they change people change but the bride a change it that's a bold statement brother Andrew you're absolutely right to unbelievers the elect of God will be standing with us save the Lord this day and a rapture morning and unbelievers will be standing on the sinking sands of men's theology on rapture morning we can be bold in what we believe here right now you're watching fear grab ahold of people's lives like never before I know I'm just a young buck but I ain't never seen fear like this grab ahold of people's life's when you got millions of people that are panicking they got millions of people that are running around trying to chase them trying to chase down all kinds of different things trying to prep and you need to prep because there's some stupid people out there you don't want to be the guy that stuff about things so you've got to prepare in that own sense but you're watching as gripping as this fear is gripping the nation what are these things because they turn down this message [Applause] [Music] this nation this nation turned down God this nation turned down this message that's why you see plates falling upon upon the nation because they turn down God but you see these things of pre-tribulation plates this is you're not in the tribulation Church God there's not been one time that God said that he would send you the bride through tribulation and some people they like to tell you that you got to go through this so that you can have rapture faith what type of God do you serve if that's the case where he's got to beat you into a rapture this God loves you this God wants to take care of you not with your elbow sickness Carlo these things are to be we're humans we're going to get sick but there's God still love us absolutely you're a human you're made of 16 elements you're going to get sick you get healing tonight you'll get sick tomorrow maybe down the road or whatnot but God still loves you some people like to say well hold on somebody must have really done a bad seeing or done something very awful in their life they get cursed with that God's not that kind of a God sick this came from Hell you don't need to be afraid of this Karuna pandemic let's spread itself across the nations across the world that doctors can't understand where it's coming from and what not what you need to be afraid of it's the pandemic of sin that there's only one cure for it I suck the horse in the corona vine has something worse in a flow there's a sin and it's a worst killer than any luck disease any cancer in the Kelowna box since trying to kill you since I'm the Rob you you don't have to allow him to come in and rob you prematurely you don't have to allow sin you can put a blood there and the blood will stops in rightness tracks how are you brother branham said he left off the pressure he said to tension he said this kitchen is building up and results it's doing something wrong and after now to play someone's rough they're acting out a place that's right he said it'll make the poor at blow away it'll make the middle class act that way it'll make the rich hack that way it'll make the wrong act that way it'll make them pretty good after that way it'll make a good after that way because it's tension it's steam built up and it's got to blow out somewhere see if you don't it'll just blow the ball or up you see you've got to let off that pressure you're at a spot tonight where you can let off the pressure you can relax in the promises of God you say well you see there's so much fear in the world right now a fear don't drive a believer faith drives a believer fear is the opposite of faith prophets said there's only two faculties that govern a human and one of them's faith which brings results and the other is fear which has no value in it all faith is of God and fears of the devil fear makes you weary and fear makes you wonder he said if I was going to die in the morning what good would it do me to get all screwed up about it what if I was going to die or what if I was going to be electrocuted in the morning and my life had to end tomorrow morning what good would that do me to worry about it well you say well what good would it do to have faith faith can sign my party sir there's value in faith don't be weary don't be scared don't be upset just have faith and believe and the only way that you can have faith you have to love first for love produces faith for perfect love perfect love casts out fear God is not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and a Salma ha if God's going to give you something he's not going to give you fear he's gonna give you faith for the promise power to watch it come to pass love and a sound mind I was dealing with an individual one time and they told me that they were going through such a chaotic time of depression and anxiety and all these things he said and I went to a spot and here I was I knew I was born again I knew I was I knew I was a son of God but yet that enemy was so gripping my life that it wanted to strangle me and take my life itself he said but one night he said I fell across this scripture and second Timothy 1 and 7 that God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and a sound mind he said I look Satan in the eye and said this is where the battle begins you see if you can realize where that's coming from you can address and send it back to it come on somebody you know if you be given power you know what their act comes from you know if you've been given love you know where that comes from if you've been given a cell model a I'll see it you know where that comes from [Applause] you know where the blessings of God are coming from it's because of God is with us you look at people they lost their compass they've lost their way they're running around scared for their life's getting in fights because of why you can boil it down to fear you can boil it down to a rejection of the Word of God you can boil it down that they lost their way and that now a people that used to walk with God now no longer walk with Him and an amnesia has set in and when you see people that are in a panic and a fear mode it shows you a lost people under temporary situations it shows you that they have no anchor to hold on to but I look out upon you and I don't sense fear here what's the difference between you and the rest of the population of the community it's because you have an anchor so what if you get diagnosed with a girl of eyes so what if it comes so what does he get diagnosed with cancer or the flu or whatnot lots bigger than all events he's bigger than skin he's bigger than your Melton he's bigger than your circumstances we're not asking for the same but I don't less like God that still heals [Applause] he watched people as amnesia sets in you can watch the people that work so that once walked in faith and all of a sudden because of pandemic and I'm not just talking about what you're seeing here but I'm talking about sin I'm talking about this pandemic when all of a sudden it seems like it's gripping in on them and Satan's got a tow coat on them they forget where they came from they forget that first love they forgot what God delivered to them in this hour you see if fear can come in it'll grab a hold of your life and it'll make you forget the promises of God if fear can grab a hold of your life it will destroy every ounce of faith that you've got that's why you as an individual have got to stay in his presence when the rest of the world doesn't have an anchor you have an anchor when the rest of the world is in fear you're in faith why because there is an anchor in the blood of Jesus vows there is an anchor in that blood that is upon the doorpost of your heart and when that blood is there sin can't get in there when that blood is there Satan can't get past that blood he may try to make you fear that it ain't fair but as long as that blood is there Satan can't come close to it you see because you as a people of God are fortified behind the word there's no greater place to be standing in and but behind the Word of God in this hour you're behind that boy when you look over in Exodus chapter 12 when Moses told them to kill the lamb that there had to be a spotless lamb a perfect lamb he'd had to be just and pure they had you had to take that lamb kill that lamb they had to be identified with that lamb they had to take the blood of that lamb and put it over the doorpost and some people that was afraid to put it out there because that would identify there with with that with that chaotic man by the name of Moses they said that God sent them to deliver deliver them from each of deliver them from Pharaoh and some people were afraid to apply the blood of Jesus even today they're afraid that it will identify their life with the Christendom of this world but I say this to you Turks that if the blotting on your door and it's not the chemical of the blood but it's not for the blood if the Holy Ghost stay on your soul unwraps our morning you will still be left here you don't have to say that way hallelujah you can look at it there under the broad the households under the blood and Moses would tell them that all of Israel and all of Egypt that the death things will pass through this land a night he's going to pass through this land a night and where the blood ain't he will come in and smite the firstborn you can imagine as all the children are there in the house and there's they're playing with their toys and all of a sudden there comes a screen throughout the city they drop their toys and they run over to the window and they see that black wind has that death angel is passing through the city and then look out across the door they looked through the window and they see a house hope that they once played in over there and the blood and on that note and the death angel walks in there and takes the firstborn and it tries to come into this household but he can't come man and the son would say Papa what's going over why take that big black wing one coming this now he say son there's a blood there that's a blood barely can't get past it you see because there's a covenant between you and God you're my first bullet but the Death Angel cannot touch you because when he saw the blood the angel of the Lord said not this one Passover not this one Passover if wisdom hips hope and household not this one Passover Passover the Death Angel swinging through the land today a Laodicea and he has to pass over this life there's safety in this life expire in this life not this one Passover [Music] what a spot of safety what a spot security that death can't come knocking on your door because the angel says not this one that's over oh ha and if you know the blood say you can rest in those promises say can they whisper in your ear and he may tell you that you're going to die but you remain resting in those promises you can imagine as the tutor little sitting there you can imagine as the screams of the city are sounding out for the whole city and they're sitting there relaxed they're not fearing they're not tore up they're not tore up they're relaxing how are they relaxing because they know that there's a covenant between El Shaddai I and between his people what about you that was under the chemical of the blood of a lamb but you are under you are under the token you are under the blood of the Lamb you can rest in the promise first sin may come knocking on your door you said Passover sickness may come knocking on your door say Passover table all families it can come knocking on your door you said not today Passover either let fear fear is going to try to knock on your door say that my else is panicking you need a planning oh absolutely not Passover [Applause] the blood holds off death he supplied it does hello as a blood is greater than your sickness as the blood is greater than your sin there's no wonder working power in the blood of Jesus that'll keep you that'll wash you and the Prophet said that when a man or woman has ever been dipped in that blood of Jesus he said he kills all symptoms and every molecule sin and it goes back to the devil and laid on him to the day of judgment where his eternal destination will be thrown into a lake of fire that's the power of the blood of Jesus that when you confess your sins to him that when you confess her sins and place them under the blood of Jesus Christ he changes the molecular status and every fragment of your sin and he demolishes your sin but the chemistry of that sin goes back upon the head of Satan and lays on him till the day of judgment and you stand guiltless you stand UNAC usable you stand as the sinless spotless bride of Jesus Christ justified in his sight like you've never done it in the first place that's the blood that's covering you tonight and when the death angel passes through the land his same Passover Passover you can rest in that because about that boy there's an eternal atonement there and Satan is defeated never sickness is defeated suicides defeated depression is defeated cancer is defeated Jesus Christ shift him of all of his power at Calvary and he has announced to you as a people that he is with us he's amongst us and he's not leaving us Bible says in Colossians 3 and 3 for ye are dead and your life is head with his head with Christ in God or the your head in Christ oh there's no hiding place down here there's no hiding place down here you can run to the rocks of hide your face but they ain't no hiding place down here but I have found the place in which I can rest assure that hiding places none of them then my lord oh there's no hiding place down here how can death get to you when you're behind the word I can send it to you when you're behind the word Christ is our Passover their safety in Christ he's our protection he's our defense he's greater than your 99.9% alcohol that kills all germs come on somebody you know you went out bought last saw and how kinds of Clorox and toilet paper you stocked up

thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and the inquiring his temple for in the time of trouble in the time of trouble prophet didn't choose first Thessalonians our 1st Corinthians to read from in the rapture but he read from this portion of Scripture sounds 27 as the background for the rapture that in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion if there's ever been a time of trouble were setting in we're living in it we're going through it but in the time of trouble he's he's not protect me this now cover me in his pavilion in the secret of this Tabernacle so I hired me and he shall set me upon the rock of Revelation hallelujah he didn't build the church on himself he builded upon the rock of Revelation and Jesus said that the gates of Hell shall not prevail against this revelation and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies you know your enemies

then I won't be new I'll get down in the trenches and I'll fight with if you ain't got for today let's get joy tomorrow wake up lifter I do want your help proverbs 8 tenants in the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and is safe it's a place that you can let off the pressure it's a place of refuge it's a place that we're told about in the Old Testament that it's a City of Refuge that if a man that had committed a crime if he done something wrong he could run into that city of refuge if his accuser and his enemy was chasing him down home and he had not got to that city they had every right to take him and overtake him but if he got on the inside of the city heywhat nothing the enemy or the accuser could do once he was on the inside of that city ever since I got on the inside of this city Satan's bid Hallett on the outside but it can't get anywhere on that [Applause] after relaxing there I'm in the city of refuge you could go through the mob and you could study out those six cities of refuge and you could study out their name but if you look at the seven city of refuge it's none other than our Lord Jesus Christ it's a place that you can run to I can't relax with all the media there telling me this they're telling me that turn it off well you've gotta be wise about these things but if it's disrupting your life don't listen to it 24/7 if it's affecting your mood and it's affecting your marriage turn off CNN NBC and listen to the KTV listen to these things there are thus a man yeah amen listen to the things that won't be tear you down but lift you up if you listen to the media man I tell you what you better get ready you're gonna die tomorrow you never know you never know it could be you you're right it could be you did you turn on the MIDI and hit a tear your last up but I never torn into this word one time and he's tore my life up but every single time I flip through the pages of the Bible I found him I find swear I find peace I find the Word of God that missed me and takes me high it's all the bible says in psalm 46 god is our refuge and strength a very present help in time in trouble therefore will we not fear will not be fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with swelling thereon sell off there is a river the streams where else shall make glad the City of God in the Holy Place of the tabernacle of the Most High God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that writerly the heathen rage the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice in the earth milk the Lord of Hosts is with us the God of Jacob is our refuge so low breed that last verse the Lord of Hosts is with us now tell me what do I have to fear if God is for me if God is with me what do I have to fear you see fear reacts to what you see fear reacts to your feelings fear reacts to what what's being said about what's in your wallet fear reacts to those things because that's what fear sees but faith only reacts to the word faith and shook up faith a movement a thing here today and gone tomorrow faith is everlasting faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of things not seen maybe you may I can't see you may not see it but faith says it's there it depends on what you're looking with can you imagine Abraham walking through life telling his neighbors I'm going to have a baby 75 years old 76 years old all the way up I'd say that there were some days that he didn't see it with his eyes but the faith of father Abraham says maybe not today but tomorrow if it ain't right now it'll be in a moment father Abraham looked at the promise when everything around him the Prophet would say against all odds abraham believed against all odds now we ain't got nobody sitting here 200 years old tonight but here Abraham was and a hundred years old still believed in the promise yet some people think there's no way that I can't have faith for 25 years look at sister Esther just in this last day these are not of things of days gone by but right now some people can't understand while hoping on the faith that longer hold it out for the promise that long but you see unbelievers won't believe but the neighbors believe that it rocks that it was my life it was my life [Music] [Applause] it ain't hard to believe a promise for a believer you just say have my word Lord I let down and faith brings it God promised it faith brings I love that faith has got its own delivery system it's better than UPS and it's better than FedEx but faith has got its own delivery system then if not and don't just bring you we don't bring you all kinds of chaos but faith brings you the promises that's amazing but fear wants to deliver to you a boxer rattlesnakes but faith says I'm not signing for that fear says you're not gonna get him to fix his hole yes I am I'm not resting in my own word and I'm not resting in the man's word but I'm resting in God's Word you see when fear is gone faith is perfect and overcome fear is to trust the word you can write that down to overcome fears to trust the word see that's what the devil wants you to do he wants you to get your mind on his talk he wants to get your mind on his language he wants you to get your mind off of God's word and he wants you to fear but to overcome fear is to trusting God's Word dad the devil wants to make you think that God don't care he wants to make you think that God don't see and that God has forgot all of his promises he wants to make you think that the days of miracles are past but there is a voice in this hour that God is with us and we will see miracles the devil is pointing you away from those things but God's putting your tool you see the devil is trying to tear you down by what you see with your eyes the God's trying to lift you up the things that you do not see he's trying to bring you to the things of eternal you see there are big people that are set here right now that a physical miracle could transpire in this service I believe a miracle could happen any moment we're gone I believe you're onboard of me tonight that that that we're if we want the supernatural to transpire that we've got to have the presence of the Lord and because without him these things are not possible but when is there a miracle content it could take place and there'll be people you you could say you could say an absolute physical miracle that you see with your own eyes you could see it transpire and transpire right in front of your eyes and you can forgive me for my the attrex but it's how it you you sit there and you'd see maybe maybe somebody come up here and had a tumor tumor on their chin or whatnot and all of a sudden you watch that thing fall off man that's God happy none other than God but there'd be people that in the morning that if they got diagnosed with something they would get home tore up and they will forget what they saw it's true it's biblical it's the people that walked the closer was swivel with Jesus they stood there with him when he was there and he was teaching all of the multitude and he's standing there and they said now we've got to send them back the disciple said we got to send them back there's no food here we've got nothing to give them they said well Jesus had one what do you got and there was a little boy that hit skip school the Prophet said now kids the only time I'm going to allow you to skip school is what Jesus is teaching then it's okay for you to skip school I know you're listening regular now and every other kid just now but here this little kid has skips goal to hear Jesus teach and they go out on the side they go out on the side of the hill and Jesus command to all the people to sit down and the disciples said now look this is all we've got we got a little schoolboy here and all of he's got all that he's got it's two fishes and five loaves of bread they smile ain't no way the Prophet said that that was barely enough to feed that little boy he said but once it was once surrendered into Jesus hands then he could bless it you see there's some things in your own life there's no way that you can make possible but one surrendering it into Jesus hands o taste and see what the Lord has done I'll magnify his name with me Jesus took these two fishes and five loaves some people say well the blood of the loaves of bread were a whole lot longer than all right the most smartest person in the whole wide world it would take a loaf besides of about three miles long to feed 5,000 people so rethink that statement but once it was in Jesus's hands when one basket would overflow it would flow into another and when they got done feeding all the 5,000 they took up twelve baskets full when you surrender anything in the Jesus's hands its magnified you may not be able to do nothing with your life but let God take it one time you may not be able to come see him but let God take it over one time they had just watched one of the greatest miracles that's told for over 2,000 years that science can't figure out right I'd say that they had one of them jaw-dropping moments what have we just watched they were watching the Messiah at work you can read it over in the book of Matthew chapter 14 you can read out how it transpires and you can read the dialogue of everything that is happening from verse 19 to verse 23 they have just watched one of the greatest miracles that's happened in front of their eyes and in verse 22 there's a gap and fear gets in this gap because Jesus goes up on a mountain to pray and his disciples get in a ship and all of a sudden the wind becomes boisterous and the sea gets all tossed about and they're all afraid and but Jesus was up on the mountain watching them the whole time and the Bible said that they cried for fear they cried for fear you see their fear was reacting to what they were seeing you see how easy it is for you to look at a miracle in front of you and all of a sudden fear gripped your life and you totally forget what just happened you think well they can't happen to me it happened to the closest people that walk with Him in human flesh fear grab their lives and they controlled them in a moment that if Jesus would not have stepped out on the scene they would have been destroyed but how can you destroy God's predestinated place you can't do it you see in that in that boat which disciples was preachers what's deacons West workers of the gospel and God could not allow them to be destroyed but fear came in there are times when you get so caught up in the things of life that you forget about what happened to brother on this ministry you have you forget what happened when he fell off a 40-foot ladder you forget what it's like you forget about when he was bit by a copperhead and every other ungodly thing that you can imagine happen to him but in the moment hate even say those words do not fear this cancer we had a prophet come and tell us in this hour do you fear cancer we've got no reason to fear cancer that's a god that's with us that's bigger than fear greater than cancer greater than any sickness don't forget it's a miracle working God is on his way [Applause] let the musicians come brother Brandon said in going away Jesus he said he said just like I said if Shakespeare was indeed I do the works of Shakespeare he said if Christ is in you you'll believe God's Word like he did he defeated the devil on every time he come and said it's written that's all and stood on it now watch this Satan note he believed that and he got away from him Satan know that Jesus believed what he had just spoken and he got away from him and the Prophet turns it says then call him call him to confirm his word making Hebrews 13:8 right then the doubts and fear will cease just like the winds did them Oh winds going through your mind maybe I won't get it maybe it won't be me maybe he won't do this don't there ain't no maybe to it he promised it that takes all the maybes out of it Satan knew that Jesus believed this and Satan knows if you believe this you've got no reason to fear because Jesus is on his way you've got no reason to get tore up don't get caught up with what's going on around you don't becoming a prisoner to fear and let it enslave you and hold you bound let your faithful ooze God's with us the God of Jacob is our refuge if God is for us what do we have to fear in this day so if we've got no fear and that's what's dangerous about sons and daughters of God is when they're operating in that realm of faith and there's no fear there it gets real dangerous for the devil some of the human beings that I have been acquainted with in life have been operating in that realm of no fear in their humanistic standpoint they're not afraid of nothing you watch them how they act to watch them how they handle things you take granddaddy for instance no fear he just went forward and tore up Jack and fixed it later he was operating in a realm of no fear tell enough to get in a tree stand after he's done broke every vertebrae and tore his hip all up no feelings but what about when you get in that around as a son of God and there's no fear you go for him you tear up Jack and you ain't got what about fixing it later you what you do as a son of God you stare down bridges you burn bridges you tear up things these things are very they're my language I understand tearing up things it's what we do best as a church we tear up Satan's Kingdom and we have no fear endure unravel me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Sophie [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] answer a family [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
