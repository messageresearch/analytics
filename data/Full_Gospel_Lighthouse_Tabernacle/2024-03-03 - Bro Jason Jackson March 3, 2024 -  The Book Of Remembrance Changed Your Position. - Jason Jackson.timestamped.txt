[56:52] things but that that was good amen
[56:56] amen you have your Bibles today turn
[56:58] with me to exter chapter
[57:09] 6 thankful for all the wonderful reports
[57:12] we heard last night and and worship of
[57:15] the Saints and the young people getting
[57:18] a supernatural outpouring and uh it's
[57:21] what it's all about we come together we
[57:25] invite him to come there's no man can
[57:28] make it
[57:29] happen as I said you didn't have to
[57:32] prime it up push it up he bubbled it up
[57:36] amen that's exactly what
[57:39] happened love it when it happens that
[57:41] way amen Esther chapter 6 and verse
[57:49] one on that night could not the king
[57:52] sleep and he commanded to bring the the
[57:55] book of records of the
[57:56] chonicles and they were read before the
[57:58] king and it was found written that Mori
[58:01] had told of big thanna and of terish two
[58:05] of the king's chamberlains the keepers
[58:08] of the door who sought to lay hand on
[58:10] the king may the Lord at his Blessing
[58:13] you may be seated this
[58:19] morning I'd like to speak on this
[58:21] morning if the Lord would just help us
[58:22] for a little while on the remembrance
[58:26] the book of remembrance changed your
[58:31] position and hang on a second I got to
[58:33] get out of this fight
[58:43] so I get nervous and then I get sweating
[58:45] and then uh someone says well this
[58:48] sweating part of sweating has nothing to
[58:50] do with my anointing when the anointing
[58:51] comes I sweat when I look at a tool belt
[58:54] so they don't have nothing to do with
[59:02] that we find here in the scripture that
[59:05] the king couldn't
[59:07] sleep and he he could have chose 20
[59:10] different diversions to fill his
[59:12] sleepless night
[59:14] with but instead he commanded that the
[59:16] Book of Records be brought to him and to
[59:19] be
[59:20] read and the one commanded to bring the
[59:23] book could brought any
[59:26] book of the records of the chonicles but
[59:29] he bought a particular book and the book
[59:33] could have been open to any
[59:35] page but he opened it to the exact page
[59:39] telling the story of Moriah and how he
[59:42] had saved the king from
[59:44] assassination God guided every step
[59:48] along that
[59:50] Journey it wasn't the king's Chamberlain
[59:53] doing the choos
[59:55] it was God right you know Jewish
[59:58] tradition says that when they opened the
[1:00:01] book at this place he turned over the
[1:00:03] leaves and would have read another part
[1:00:05] of the
[1:00:07] book but a wind came by and blew the
[1:00:11] leaves of the PIP of the paper of the of
[1:00:14] the book back open to the same place to
[1:00:16] where he had opened it at so he was
[1:00:19] forced to read the
[1:00:21] paragraph how mori's good service was
[1:00:24] record orted in Aster 2 and verse 23
[1:00:27] where it was found upon record of how he
[1:00:30] exposed the
[1:00:32] plot brother that's just a tradition
[1:00:34] well I know of another time of it
[1:00:36] happening when a prophet of God didn't
[1:00:39] understand Hebrews chapter 6 and he was
[1:00:42] there and he laid open his Bible and a
[1:00:44] wind came
[1:00:46] by and blew it open to another
[1:00:51] passage and he closed the Bible and he
[1:00:54] laid it down he meditated and then he
[1:00:56] opened the Bible back up just
[1:00:58] anywhere but it blew back open to
[1:01:00] Hebrews chapter
[1:01:02] 6 and then he saw the
[1:01:05] vision and then he understood the
[1:01:08] scripture even as the king had the book
[1:01:11] of records of chonicles which really
[1:01:14] literally means a book of
[1:01:17] remembrance so God also has a book of
[1:01:21] remembrance and then those who fear the
[1:01:24] lord Lord spoke to one another and the
[1:01:27] Lord listened and heard them Malachi
[1:01:30] chapter 3 so a book of remembrance was
[1:01:32] written before him for those who fear
[1:01:36] the lord who meditate on his
[1:01:41] name what an
[1:01:44] honor what an honor it is to be in the
[1:01:46] book of
[1:01:47] remembrance and the King
[1:01:50] said what honor or dignity has been
[1:01:54] bestowed upon
[1:01:56] Moriah for the deed that he has
[1:02:00] done and hmon coming to the
[1:02:03] courts of the king and now who was of
[1:02:06] the agites who was a descendant of the
[1:02:10] amalekites who was supposed to be
[1:02:12] destroyed to begin with by
[1:02:15] Saul and if Saul would have destroyed
[1:02:17] him he wouldn't have been a
[1:02:19] nuisance right so the king said who's in
[1:02:22] the
[1:02:22] court and they said hey man just entered
[1:02:25] the outer court and he's got a
[1:02:28] suggestion in his heart now he wanted to
[1:02:30] hang Moriah but the king's wanting to
[1:02:33] bless
[1:02:36] Moriah Hallelujah he had a Gallows
[1:02:39] prepared for him and the King's servant
[1:02:41] said hmon is here standing in the court
[1:02:43] and the King said oh let him come
[1:02:46] in it was no
[1:02:48] coincidence that hmon entered the king's
[1:02:50] court at this
[1:02:52] moment to ask for
[1:02:55] execution but it was no coincidence that
[1:02:58] the king wanted to honor Moriah at this
[1:03:02] moment see when your enemy comes to the
[1:03:05] king and he wants to come against you
[1:03:08] the king already has a blessing
[1:03:10] pronounced upon
[1:03:15] you and in This Book of Esther shows us
[1:03:18] anything it shows us that God manages
[1:03:21] the Affairs of
[1:03:22] men even without our
[1:03:25] knowledge God knows what he's doing and
[1:03:27] in the courts of Heaven there's no
[1:03:29] coincidences there's no
[1:03:34] surprises hey well Esther was lucky to
[1:03:36] be Queen no she
[1:03:38] wasn't Mori wasn't lucky to be overheard
[1:03:42] the assassination plot it wasn't luck or
[1:03:44] chance that made hymon enter the Royal
[1:03:47] Courts at the time with this on his
[1:03:49] heart all these events were orchestrated
[1:03:52] by almighty God
[1:03:55] not by
[1:03:58] luck and this becomes difficult when bad
[1:04:01] things happen to us it's easy to see
[1:04:04] God's management of all things when we
[1:04:06] see good things
[1:04:07] happen but what about the bad right even
[1:04:12] then we got to trust in God's total
[1:04:14] total plan realizing all things work
[1:04:17] together for the good Romans 8: 28 we
[1:04:22] understand Paul was saying all things
[1:04:24] work together for the good now you take
[1:04:26] one event and it might not look so good
[1:04:29] but the whole plan you got to see the
[1:04:32] whole picture of God's plan and then
[1:04:35] it'll all work together for the
[1:04:38] good so then hmon comes in and he ask
[1:04:40] the king and the King asked him he says
[1:04:43] heymen what shall be done to the man
[1:04:46] whom the king Delights to
[1:04:48] honor well it's got to be
[1:04:51] me I'm his right-and man
[1:04:55] what would I like the king to do for me
[1:04:56] wow man so he immediately started
[1:04:58] thinking of Natural Things cuz he was
[1:05:02] carnal
[1:05:04] right King goes man ain't nobody else
[1:05:07] the king wants to Delight more than
[1:05:09] me isn't it amazing how God already
[1:05:12] orchestrated so not only all the Jews
[1:05:14] would be ultimately protected but both
[1:05:16] Moriah and hmon would get what was
[1:05:19] deserving to them huh God often the time
[1:05:22] lets a fallen man set his own
[1:05:25] trap allowing hmon to make
[1:05:29] pride and arrogance be the cause of his
[1:05:32] ultimate demise and
[1:05:35] humiliation now hmon gives his answer in
[1:05:38] verse 7-9 of chapter 6 he answers the
[1:05:41] king and he says for the man whom the
[1:05:44] king Delights to honor let a royal
[1:05:48] robe be brought which the King has
[1:05:53] worn and a horse on which the King has
[1:05:59] rid and let a crown a Royal Crest be
[1:06:02] placed on his head then let his robe and
[1:06:05] the horse be delivered to him by the
[1:06:07] hand of one of the king's most noble
[1:06:11] princes that he may be a raid and the
[1:06:14] man from whom the king Delight to honor
[1:06:16] and then parade him on horse back
[1:06:18] through the streets oh
[1:06:20] yeah man he's setting up a huge
[1:06:23] celebration
[1:06:24] for his
[1:06:26] enemy yet he don't know it but God knew
[1:06:33] it hmon you know was the only thing that
[1:06:36] pleased hmon was Applause and and to be
[1:06:40] shattered to be you
[1:06:42] know glittering and shining and the
[1:06:46] center of attention and it's tragic when
[1:06:49] a man can only believe he has done well
[1:06:51] when he heard Applause now don't get me
[1:06:52] wrong there's a good time an appropriate
[1:06:54] time for applauses to have here on Earth
[1:06:58] but when you live to expect
[1:07:00] it and you're seeking for it that's
[1:07:03] another thing we should seek what wants
[1:07:06] to be sat to be satisfied with what
[1:07:08] heaven wants of us and not what man
[1:07:11] wants of
[1:07:14] us then the king answered heon he goes
[1:07:17] that's a good idea
[1:07:19] heon he says go make ready and take all
[1:07:22] this stuff and give it to
[1:07:25] Moriah who sits at the king's
[1:07:28] gate what Moriah is going to get what I
[1:07:32] asked
[1:07:34] for what kind of a joke is
[1:07:36] this let me tell you the devil wants to
[1:07:39] do you
[1:07:41] in but God has another
[1:07:46] plan wouldn't have been something to
[1:07:48] seen Hon's face at that
[1:07:50] time see the king took his vice
[1:07:53] completely you know you know and you're
[1:07:54] sitting there and he gives honor to his
[1:07:56] arch enemy and haymon's coming to ask
[1:07:58] for the man's execution and what a
[1:08:02] humiliation but where it changed for
[1:08:05] Moriah was when the book of remembrance
[1:08:09] was
[1:08:11] brought and it was
[1:08:15] opened it changed his
[1:08:17] position cuz the king did not know about
[1:08:21] this plot or about this s thing at the
[1:08:24] time or had forgotten but when the book
[1:08:27] became
[1:08:28] open then it become a brand new
[1:08:33] identity mori's identity became
[1:08:37] real it wasn't no longer just a haymon's
[1:08:41] identity oh yeah he was identified but
[1:08:44] they changed
[1:08:48] positions Hallelujah hmon wanted to keep
[1:08:51] the book
[1:08:52] sealed
[1:08:54] you understand the devil wanted to keep
[1:08:57] the book
[1:08:59] sealed and as long as it was sealed you
[1:09:01] would never find your
[1:09:04] identity isn't that right you you'd have
[1:09:06] never known who you was but when the
[1:09:09] book became open it revealed your
[1:09:11] identity the devil wanted you to sit
[1:09:15] there and be
[1:09:17] doomed God says not the time for
[1:09:20] it for Daniel said seal up the book
[1:09:24] and reveal it at the time of the end cuz
[1:09:28] there's a Time coming when the book had
[1:09:30] to be open but as long as it was
[1:09:36] sealed as long as it was sealed you
[1:09:39] didn't have your
[1:09:41] identity brother would you get me that
[1:09:43] blue song book off the right there I
[1:09:45] forgot to bring that out
[1:09:48] here I'm not going to
[1:09:51] sing no it's not happening not today
[1:09:54] anyhow how wanted to be kept
[1:09:58] sealed so you couldn't find your
[1:10:00] identity
[1:10:02] but the time of the end is now here
[1:10:07] right so now it has to be open and John
[1:10:10] in Revelations chapter 5 he said who is
[1:10:13] worthy to take the book and to loose the
[1:10:16] seals thereof and he looked over heaven
[1:10:19] and he looked under the Earth and he
[1:10:21] looked beneath the Earth and he looked
[1:10:22] in the Earth and nobody was
[1:10:27] worthy John wasn't worthy brother
[1:10:30] brandham wasn't
[1:10:32] worthy brother Ron wasn't
[1:10:35] worthy huh I wasn't worthy you wasn't
[1:10:40] worthy nobody was
[1:10:43] worthy and John began to
[1:10:47] weep and now just think of it now the
[1:10:51] lamb begins to come to forth to take the
[1:10:58] book because it's his
[1:11:01] book but as long as it's closed you
[1:11:05] can't see what's in it because the word
[1:11:08] said for it to be sealed and to be
[1:11:10] hidden but there's coming a time when
[1:11:12] it's to be open and John's listen
[1:11:15] brother B said if John knew that book
[1:11:17] didn't become open all Humanity was
[1:11:20] doomed they were lost but the come a
[1:11:24] time and John's there and he's weeping
[1:11:27] and all of a sudden he hears a voice
[1:11:29] saying to him weep not John Behold The
[1:11:33] Lion of the tribe of Judah has
[1:11:38] prevailed and he is worthy to take the
[1:11:41] book and to open the
[1:11:44] seals and John said I turned to look to
[1:11:46] see a lamb but I didn't see a lamb I saw
[1:11:50] a
[1:11:50] Lon that had prevailed he'd been in
[1:11:54] battle who was he in battle for those
[1:11:58] whose names were sealed in the book your
[1:12:02] identity was in here he went to war for
[1:12:05] you Hallelujah he was making
[1:12:08] intercession for
[1:12:10] you and he he said he has
[1:12:13] prevailed and he said and when I look
[1:12:16] there he was a bloody bleeding lamb he
[1:12:21] heard a line I'm sorry I got that wrong
[1:12:22] well he heard a line
[1:12:24] but when he looked he saw a lamb that
[1:12:26] had been slain one that was dead but
[1:12:29] alive
[1:12:31] again Hallelujah and when that book
[1:12:34] became open there was a lot of things in
[1:12:36] there hidden your identity your name
[1:12:40] your
[1:12:42] destiny listen church as long as it was
[1:12:45] sealed you would never overcome and lay
[1:12:47] to AIA but when the book became
[1:12:51] open now you have victory
[1:12:54] now you have
[1:12:55] [Applause]
[1:12:58] freedom
[1:13:05] Hallelujah everybody wasn't going to be
[1:13:07] in
[1:13:08] there everybody's names ain't in the
[1:13:11] book of
[1:13:13] redemption but there is a few things
[1:13:15] that was in there and when John comes
[1:13:17] here now he's been in now he sees him
[1:13:19] he's interceding for the souls that
[1:13:22] would come until the last Soul comes
[1:13:27] in and we got to be getting
[1:13:30] close that last soul may be here this
[1:13:32] morning might just not have given in yet
[1:13:35] but let me tell you wherever they
[1:13:38] are let's do our part to find
[1:13:43] them let's get out of this pest
[1:13:47] house but when the book became open now
[1:13:51] it changed John
[1:13:54] position watch from weeping to shouting
[1:14:00] Hallelujah now he didn't have nothing to
[1:14:03] weep about because the lamb had the
[1:14:07] book Hallelujah in his hands and he was
[1:14:12] the author of the
[1:14:14] book Hallelujah so now he's got it in
[1:14:17] his hands and John said everything in
[1:14:19] heaven everything beneath the Earth
[1:14:22] everything in the earth heard me
[1:14:25] praising
[1:14:28] God well brother Jason y'all get a
[1:14:30] little too noisy up there in the
[1:14:32] mountains of
[1:14:34] Virginia oh you think it's noisy here
[1:14:37] wait till you get over
[1:14:39] there this is the quietest place you'll
[1:14:42] ever be
[1:14:47] at you go to hell there's weeping and
[1:14:50] wailing you go to Glory there'll be
[1:14:52] shouting on their Hills of Glory so if
[1:14:55] we're going to shout over there we might
[1:14:57] as well get ready
[1:15:03] here your identity has been
[1:15:07] released the book of remembrance changed
[1:15:10] our
[1:15:14] position and when John saw his position
[1:15:17] it exposed Satan for who he was and what
[1:15:21] his plan was and his plan was to destroy
[1:15:24] you and to murder you and to kill you
[1:15:29] and to send you to a devil's hell but
[1:15:31] God's plan was is that you might have
[1:15:34] life and you might have life more
[1:15:39] abundantly he changed the position from
[1:15:41] a dying sinner to an everlasting living
[1:15:45] Saint calling those things which were
[1:15:47] not as though they were cuz God said
[1:15:51] so and that's when it changed for for us
[1:15:54] is when the book came
[1:15:56] open cuz see before before your book
[1:15:59] came
[1:16:00] open this was your
[1:16:06] book this was your
[1:16:08] life besides this book ain't got enough
[1:16:11] pages in
[1:16:14] it it ain't got enough pages in it for
[1:16:16] my life but you get the point this was
[1:16:20] our life full of sin full of misery
[1:16:25] that's
[1:16:26] right right and the devil could come to
[1:16:29] you anytime and say you did this this
[1:16:32] this and this y'all know what devil
[1:16:33] y'all know what devil y'all know what
[1:16:34] devil but once you recognized who you
[1:16:38] was once your identity had been
[1:16:41] revealed once you had accepted the
[1:16:44] message of the hour and recognized it to
[1:16:47] be Eagle food and once you heard from
[1:16:49] your
[1:16:51] theophany and this become an open book
[1:16:54] listen the Seven Seals being open is not
[1:16:56] open to everybody it's open to those who
[1:16:59] can receive
[1:17:01] it and I happen to believe I'm speaking
[1:17:04] to a group of people who can receive
[1:17:08] [Applause]
[1:17:10] it so what's my book looking like now
[1:17:12] brother
[1:17:19] Jason Huh there is therefore now no
[1:17:22] condemnation
[1:17:23] to them that are in Christ Jesus there's
[1:17:26] no more sin held against you it's all
[1:17:28] washed away from you what the devil
[1:17:30] meant for evil God used it for good he
[1:17:34] changed the position on the devil and
[1:17:36] put the curse back upon the man whom it
[1:17:38] came
[1:17:41] from it's not against us
[1:17:45] anymore maybe we could word it like this
[1:17:48] and Jesus
[1:17:51] said like pil
[1:17:54] I find no fault in
[1:17:59] them brother Jason I still remember what
[1:18:01] I used to do he
[1:18:04] don't see we're we're we're F out we're
[1:18:07] going to remember those things and we're
[1:18:09] we're never going to forget the bad
[1:18:10] things that we've
[1:18:12] done but God don't have a record of it
[1:18:16] your old record has been
[1:18:19] diversed it's been put
[1:18:21] away that's why you can sing the way you
[1:18:24] sing that's why you can worship the way
[1:18:27] you worship the old man is
[1:18:29] dead there's a brand new
[1:18:32] man you've been set
[1:18:36] free and he who the son has made free is
[1:18:39] free
[1:18:41] [Applause]
[1:18:44] indeed and it's only to be revealed at
[1:18:47] the last day he said verse Seal when
[1:18:49] this actual seal is broken broken to
[1:18:51] whom not to Christ but to the church
[1:18:54] notice oh my that just makes me tremble
[1:18:58] I hope that the church truly understands
[1:18:59] what I mean you people and then he stops
[1:19:02] and he goes I'm going to call you bride
[1:19:06] so that you might
[1:19:09] understand you're not part of the church
[1:19:11] out
[1:19:12] there you're the Lamb's wife you're his
[1:19:16] bride and the open book now changed your
[1:19:20] position you once was a sinner but now
[1:19:22] you are a child of God but really you
[1:19:25] always was a child of God you just now
[1:19:28] recognize you was a child of
[1:19:32] God and you can't eat on the dead caring
[1:19:35] of the
[1:19:36] world Christians don't eat that way we
[1:19:39] don't eat on denominational
[1:19:42] doctrines we eat on the fresh kill of
[1:19:44] the word and the fresh kill of the word
[1:19:46] is
[1:19:48] here it's Among Us he's making himself
[1:19:52] revealed in this this last hour he's
[1:19:54] coming behind his word and
[1:19:58] vindicating he he's proud when his word
[1:20:00] is
[1:20:02] preached and now he promised us in this
[1:20:04] last day a full Square
[1:20:09] meal a seven course menu for all the
[1:20:13] seals is open and ready for the word of
[1:20:15] God to those who can
[1:20:20] receive I don't know about you but
[1:20:23] how many can receive
[1:20:25] it because it's for you so then when you
[1:20:27] receive the word you find your identity
[1:20:29] in it when you receive this open book it
[1:20:33] changes
[1:20:34] you brother B said when the seals come
[1:20:37] open it made the Bible a brand new book
[1:20:39] to
[1:20:40] him and if it made it a new book to the
[1:20:42] prophet it ought to make it a new book
[1:20:44] to the
[1:20:45] people of you're the people of the
[1:20:48] book the book was redeemed because of

[2:20:55] witness that this open book has changed
[2:20:58] our
[2:20:59] position we're a witness of it Miracles
[2:21:02] are not something new to us because God
[2:21:05] is all Supernatural they're Supernatural
[2:21:07] to us but it's natural for God to do
[2:21:09] these things we are a witness that the
[2:21:13] same angel that was with William
[2:21:15] brandham the same angel that was with
[2:21:18] the pillar that was with the children of
[2:21:19] Israel as a pillar of fire that same
[2:21:21] Angel's
[2:21:24] here I want to share this with you this
[2:21:27] come from Brother Joel just come on my
[2:21:29] heart he sent me this this
[2:21:32] week you all know that his father his
[2:21:35] father has been facing and been
[2:21:37] diagnosed with cancer but he shared this
[2:21:40] with me this week he said I just wanted
[2:21:42] to send you a quick note quick text
[2:21:44] because I'm about to come unglued
[2:21:48] with joy I found out the test results
[2:21:50] from my dad that he went back for
[2:21:53] following up testing and his numbers
[2:21:54] have dropped dramatically in his PSA
[2:21:57] which indicates that where the cancer
[2:22:00] has originated from the cancer is dying
[2:22:03] without
[2:22:09] chemotherapy
[2:22:12] hallelujah hallelujah why shouldn't we
[2:22:15] why shouldn't we praise him
[2:22:18] why wouldn't she why shouldn't we
[2:22:20] magnify his
[2:22:23] name I believe I've come
[2:22:25] unglued we've had a week this week both
[2:22:28] our
[2:22:29] dads both our
[2:22:32] dads we got two witnesses in the
[2:22:36] message
[2:22:38] cancer has no
[2:22:40] hold so if he can do that in the eye and
[2:22:43] if he can do that all the way in Ohio
[2:22:45] surely he can take a man of God God that
[2:22:48] has refused to back
[2:22:50] down and he can curse cancer throughout
[2:22:53] all of his
[2:22:54] body well we might as well come
[2:23:00] unglued
[2:23:02] [Applause]
[2:23:03] hallelujah what a weekend what a
[2:23:07] blessing what a time in the presence of
[2:23:09] the
[2:23:13] Lord many of you weren't here last night
[2:23:17] many had done been dismissed and I got
[2:23:20] to see something last night and I saw
[2:23:22] the full vision of what our pastor
[2:23:25] anticipated with those doors open back
[2:23:27] there because the Holy Spirit was still
[2:23:29] dealing with brothers and sisters here
[2:23:32] as it was dismissed but the presence of
[2:23:35] God was so thick that it literally draw
[2:23:38] people that had already been dismissed
[2:23:39] right back in and I've never seen
[2:23:42] anything like I've ever seen before
[2:23:45] thank you our young
[2:23:47] people so moved by the holy spirit so
[2:23:51] touched little five and six and eight
[2:23:54] and nine year old girls coming out of
[2:23:56] here speaking and singing in
[2:24:00] tongues what is it it's exactly what
[2:24:03] brother Jason preached last night it's a
[2:24:05] power
[2:24:06] within he will finish the
[2:24:09] work no it's not everything no it's not
[2:24:12] everything to shout no it's not
[2:24:13] everything to speak in tongues but it
[2:24:15] sure does mean something
[2:24:17] when The Giver of the gift comes and
[2:24:20] pours out his life so much and I believe
[2:24:23] that some people ought to take a lesson
[2:24:25] from these young kids that they're so
[2:24:26] moved by the Holy
[2:24:32] Ghost what we've seen in this
[2:24:36] generation he will finish what he's
[2:24:38] about to do the body change is our
[2:24:42] goal and sing that song down from his
[2:24:45] glory
[2:24:50] so if you have not been a part of our
[2:24:52] After parties here at Full Gospel
[2:24:55] Lighthouse we welcome
[2:24:57] you we welcome
[2:25:00] you if you don't want to be dismissed
[2:25:02] you don't have to be
[2:25:04] dismissed we got a team here that will
[2:25:07] help you we are experts in the Holy
[2:25:09] Ghost around

[2:25:18] Ghost we'll make sure that you get in
[2:25:19] the car and you have a responsible
[2:25:21] driver but we invite
[2:25:24] you we invite you to come and be a part
[2:25:27] of
[2:25:27] this we the thing that point that so
[2:25:31] amazes
[2:25:32] me about the grace of
[2:25:35] God is that when you watch one person
[2:25:38] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost this
[2:25:39] is a sign to me that it's him it's
[2:25:42] because they come out and what do they
[2:25:44] want they want the next person to get
[2:25:46] what they just
[2:25:49] received and brother brandham said now
[2:25:51] if we're too ashamed to testify what he
[2:25:53] did for us he said it really wasn't a
[2:25:54] holy ghost but to see somebody come out
[2:25:57] from underneath that anointing and say I
[2:25:58] want to see that for that one I want to
[2:26:00] see it for that
[2:26:01] one for Gospel Lighthouse you're a light
