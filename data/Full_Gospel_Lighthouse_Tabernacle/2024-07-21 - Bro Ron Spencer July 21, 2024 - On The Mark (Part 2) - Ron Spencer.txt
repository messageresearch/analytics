Revelations chapter 3 and verse 21 then we'll go to Revelations 12 and verse 11 now I'm part of this scripture I just have to be honest with you I'm part of this one so I'm not being very vain here I'm just reading what I'm doing to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne Revelations 12 and verse 11 and they overcame by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death maybe you have a need on your heart this morning and I believe God's a miracle working God and that that request that came in for brother Ron jingling he's a personal friend of mine he's from Regina he goes to brother Kelly hilderbrand church and we've been friends a very long time also sister Alma uh Jen that we had requests for I called her yesterday she's about 40 mil below below Branson Missour and they watch our services here she has cancer been battling they've taken her in small intestines out along with some other things and I just talked to her like she hadd been here forever and we just had a wonderful conversation and then we went to prayer and and um maybe you have a need that God knows all about amen amen it he a wonderful personal God Amen let's pray Lord Jesus we love you today with all of our hearts and we're just thankful that we can come to your house this is a place that has been set aside to where that we come and meet you we gather as bride Believers and and maybe we struggle through the week and have different storms that would come in our lives and revivals that would come in our homes and and then we come to service and it's kind of like a bee that finds honey Lord and then we come back to the hive and announce that there's honey over here now Lord we've come to announce a Revival today it's in my heart and we can truly say like that policeman said you've arrived I am the Revival now Lord Jesus we ask you that you would meet the needs of your children sister Alma that that watches the service Lord with this cancer and these situations brother Ron jinling that is a personal friend of mine Lord I ask you that you would just come and and just Lord help us that our faith would have the opportunity to work like never before you see the many needs that are here Lord sister Pat that goes for her her her consultation tomorrow we ask you that you would just be in the whole workings of that now every person that's here all of us want a fresh refilling of the Holy Ghost now while the word Goes Forth today I pray that you would just fall Upon Us Lord we're expecting from you and Lord we need that fresh and true Revival in our hearts and minister to us and anoint the speaker Lord you know our needs even as we're standing here Lord strengthen us today in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen God bless you God bless you you can be seated I didn't say that second part did I amen I want to thank Brother Ray our vision is coming together and all the team he didn't do it by himself the whole team that has been working with him and I I want to thank each and every one of you and always remember that God is the great payer of it all and I tell you what I saw it in Vision but now I see it in reality amen I was standing in an I was standing in a hotel in Pennsylvania and hey if I have knew you guys I'd have come over to your house and had supper but it was in your part of the world the vision took place for these doors to be and so so we're just so thankful I came back and talked to brother Andrew about it and I talked to Brother Ray and he said well that's doable and it is amen and so we're just so thankful for that and so we appreciate that with all of our hearts and brother Ray was sent me an apologetic letter last night that they're not done and he said there's more work to do and I thought man you know to to make mayonnaise you have to break a few eggs and so you know you got to go through that construction deal and so you guys are very patient with us and so thank you for doing that and he he told me that he'd be getting it done and so thank you brother Ray and all of you that are working with us God bless you God bless you amen last week I spoke to you on the mark and brother brandham said when the saints would go through the through the they would pass and they they died with a certain expectation looking for the Rapture looking for the resurrection and they went to the to their death with an expectation he said if they did not went to their death with that expectation if God would have told Paul that it's going to be 2,000 years he said that expectation would have would have dissolved and and they just went on and they liveed their lives with no no no expectation for the resurrection and just live their lives very haphazardly but he said on Resurrection morning he said they'll raise with the same expectation as when they went into the ground last night as I was listening to brother Andrew and as he was going through those Heroes of Faith and and from all the way the Welsh Revival and those people that were a part of that and each and every one of them that lived incredible hero lives they were ordinary people just like you and I but God lit their candle kind of like he lit your candle and you know they you know they just sered God with everything that was in their hearts and just did an incredible incredible work that they were there and some of them live very poor lives they lived very struggling lives and none of them had wings on their back come on probably never saw the pillar of fire in a lot of ways I I'd like to add something to that if I can now don't charge me for my time now so Columba I actually stood with brother George Quinn at Columbus home and you you couldn't put that piano in his home you think great big castles or you think great big houses but that was about the size of of his house and it was a rock ledge that is still there today the house has fell down but there's a rock ledge that's still there today where he slept and they would take they would take skins and they would take Furs and lay on there and they that was their bed you know I think of my mattress and sometimes I complain about where I sleep but that'd be a tough place to sleep and in God's great plan he had him as a messenger of the day laying on that rock ledge now now he would step out from there and he'd step out about 40 ft and from there there was a big valley that was just below him and there was a village just to the right and he would stand on this rock and he would preach and his voice would go out across that Valley and hundreds of people would come to listen to that messenger speak now now I want you to just think about it they said and this is not l but they said that while he prayed brother Doug that through the keyhole you could see the pillar of Fire shining as he prayed and people would come and and they would they would go and slip up to the house so that they could watch that Pillar of Fire coming out of that Keyhole amen now I'm sharing this with you just for a moment and as I was I walked out and it was it's now some sheep it's it's a it's a farm and and the fellow let us go to it and uh uh we walked over to another place where that they they have legends about it but and anyway they call it good luck and brother George will write me this week and tell me exactly what that is and so hello brother George and so and so anyway we were walking up just behind the house and we were going up and I I said brother George I said when I get there and I shake Columbus hand I'm going I'm going to tell him I was at your house and when I told him there there was a warm wind that just came down over top of brother George and myself you talking about a feeling hallelujah oh what a land that it will be amen amen thank you Lord now when we read about to him that overcometh Not only was those people on the mark come on but we are to be on the mark in this day there's a there's a couple of sermons that I want to preach when I come back from Brother Toms and and I I want you to just think about this and and there's going to be a people that's left behind they're going to be left behind and they're going to have to overcome in very difficult conditions people that even set among us that'll be left behind and you see how will they be left behind they don't have the Holy Ghost they wasn't sincere or wasn't committed and this is a very dark age and very lazy age and it gets aart Le oosa gets a part of it and they get into a frame of mind to where that that you know it's just going to be all right that messenger's been gone for all of these years now and the message is depleted and may by excuses by excuses they find them themselves in a very horrible condition and listen I I I don't want to preach that this morning but there's nothing in my mind thinking that I want to stay [Applause] here there's not a job that's too important there's not another person that's too important there's not a Hollywood celebrity that's too important there's not the presidential race that's too important listen don't get yourself all concerned with all that God's got that in his hands he's got that in his hands Let them fight it out let them fight it out don't you fight it out Let Them Fight It Out I'll tell you who will win the one that God wants to [Applause] win but I want us to be on the Mark I want to be on the Mark I want to be ready like never before but let me just say this you each and every one of us have a battle that we have to contend with every one of us sitting here everyone in the invisible audience have a battle in this darkness that you and I have to contend with I I'll read just a little bit about Shadrach mesach and abendigo but God had it in his hands he also has you in his [Music] hands there may not be a hundred people in your community that really know who you are are you are you with me now oh but I'm more important than 100 people really really you have a church here about 250 to 300 people that know you in a certain way and they realize how important you are but let me just say this you God knows the one that created the heavens and the Earth he predestinated you to live in this specific hour you couldn't be born in any other day you're not an accident and let me just say a couple things here you didn't come here to lose God didn't bring you here to lose to him that overc cometh and they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony you said it last night brother Andrew the word that is in our mouth you are what you speak your confession going under your lips when you confess the very word of God that is the most powerful thing on the earth then God comes along and backs it up my favorite scripture No Weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in the Judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord now just think about King Jehoshaphat think about what he did when the army were knocking on the door of his kingdom 2 chonicles chapter 20 he began to seek God I think that's a good place to start he begins seeking God's face and reminding him of his promise of God's supreme power Jehoshaphat cried for help admitting his weaknesses he didn't know what to do his eyes were fixed upon God and and so was his expectations the result of his battle God moved in a powerful way on the behalf of him and his people we must stay in constant contact with God don't just seek him when you're in [Applause] trouble did you hear that don't just seek God God when you're in [Music] trouble notice his prayer oh Lord God of our fathers art th thou the kingdom of a god of heaven and rulest not that thou over all the kingdoms of the Heathen and in thy hand is there not power and might so that none of the is able to withstand thee h oh I love that don't you I read this portion of a quote last week and I want to read this just one sentence God's purpose can never be defeated amen I want you to turn to your neighbor and I want you to say God's purpose he didn't say your plan your thoughts your opinions can you imagine if it worked out that Humanity had control some of you like blue some of you like purple some of you like yellow are you with me but God loves blue well how do you know that look up look up Romans chapter 8 verse 31 I'm not going any further on that thought Romans chapter 8 and verse 31 and what shall we then say to these things I want you to read this with me if God be for us who can be against us he he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him freely also also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify I'm thankful for that right now it is not a man or a judge that justifies us it's not our best friends that justifies us it is God that justifies and Justified it is as though you never did it in the first [Applause] place thank you Jesus did you get that point brother brother on I'm just I'm constantly trying to be better for my friends forget it your friends will only be there in the good times are you with me when things get really tough they'll be like job friends you had to sin to be in that condition can you imagine how many people has told me brother Ron if you can get the sin out of your life you'll get healed I'm glad God told me before any of this trial took place if you will trust me I will use you like never before [Applause] he didn't say if you trust your friends cuz after a while their energy runs out but if you trust me and God's the kind of God that never runs out of his bank account his healing power does not diminish his his saving power does not diminish it is God that justifies us amen speak more on that next week thank you Lord who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who maketh intercession for us I love these the scripture who shall separate us from the love of Christ notice how powerful Paul puts this if you're serving God there's nothing to get between you he takes care of the excuse use Department amen it is Christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword he kind of covers it all and as it is written for thy sake we're killed all the day long and were counted as sheep for a Slaughter nay and all these things were're more than conquerors amen brother Ron you read that scripture a thousand times if you stick around here long you'll the count will go up nay in all of these things we are more than conquerors though you have to live in Le oia you're going to overcome it this scripture does not have a time date stamp on [Applause] it you're going to overcome in 20 24 you happen to be the predestinated seed that's put here God didn't put you here to lose he didn't put you here to fail you going to win you're going to win for I persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers or things present or things to come nor height nor depth or any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord well my best friend quit so preachers fail so if you're in love with God let them go Philippians chapter 3 and ver verse 13 bre I count myself I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing that I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I want you to read this next verse with me if you'll do that Hallelujah I'm having trouble with my vision but I'll get through it and there went my notes hang on don't read it until I get there Brethren I count I'm going to have to read it again Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this thing one thing that I do forgetting those things which are behind reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God which is in Christ Jesus now I want you to understand God is not in the guessing business he's not putting chemicals together to see if it'll work come on now in the horse in the horse industry they will breed this horse to this horse and this horse to and they're very interested in the Bloodlines you've been around a little bit welcome too I love horses so so anyway they breed these horses together they will spend millions of dollars in study to try to get the guy that can do the Kentucky Derby and the Pras and Belmont they'll try to their best I don't pay attention to those things but they'll do their best to have blood lines that they know that will work because if they win if they win that horse immediately becomes worth milon ions of dollars somewhere somewhere around it's estimated somewhere around $30 million that horse will be worth overnight last year the horse that R won the Kentucky Derby they sold him for Junk for $25,000 and an old farmer bought and he so happened to put him in a Ricky dink trailer and hired a jockey to ride on him and he won the Kentucky Derby what does that have to do with your sermon this morning you look like junk you look like junk you're made out of mud don't get your wings out now I'm going to I'm coming at you on none of you made the who's who so go ahead and take the starchy out of you without God none of us without God none of us are you with me say it with me so you'll help yourself without God none of us can do anything Hallelujah brother Homer and I preached a funeral wake up brother Homer and I preached a funeral and when it was over with all the children walked up and spit on the on the casket they had such a disdain and such a hatred for the man let me just say this to you I don't want to end up like that I I don't want to end up like that brother Homer brother Homer he did his best to get him to to have a chance for love once again it really hurt his feelings but let me just say when it comes to the end of my road I want people to look and say this man was a warrior this man was a Christian this man was a real pastor this man was a real father I'm coming to you this man was on the [Applause] mark are you with me now now brother random says this this is very familiar to you and he says now he said right down to the time that he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights it he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she stands for she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army and if you know anything about Invincible that means you're undefeated there's no way that you can be defeated that's the way God looks at you I want you to think about it maybe you got up this morning your hair was 40 mil from Sunday you brushed it felt like a dinosaur got in your mouth died and rotted there's an overcomer you gentlemen your beards are tucked out and you're starting to stand up a little bit and you start shaving that face I think probably in heaven we're all going to be having beards that's that's not a quote you don't go look for it I I'll get i'll get letters this week brother Ron where does it say you have to have a have to have a beard it is not how you look at yourself it is how God looks at you it's how God looks at you now so many times we walk into church and we get all kind of excuses we walk in and we're under an atmosphere of defeat under an atmosphere of depression we're under all different kind of atmospheres of fighting that we fought all week long hopefully not with your wife but you walk in and because you're under such a cloud you can't get anything out of service you know I sat last night I have the luxury of sitting and on on Saturday night and watching you and watching Andrew and I'll be really honest with you I told sister Connie I wish I could walk through the building and say you need this wake up come on listen backsliding is not going getting drunk backsliding is not cheating on your wife or cheating on your husband all that sin that that's just sin too backsliding is sitting in church and getting cold I don't need this I don't need this I don't need this well it you know I wish I could just push you know push fast forward and be done with it and go to Burger King you need this you need this I want to tell you you need this you need this can I say it over again you need this well brother Ron did you see so and so I could care less about seeing so and so I come to meet God I come to get in his presence I don't care how long we've been a preacher how long we've been a servant of God or how long we've done this I want more of him [Applause] now brother brandom this this is a little bit of a long cloak but I believe I believe you enjoy it three three Hebrew children he says this is to God he said I can see him watching and all at once a great Angel comes up to his right side and stands at his attention putting his hand on his sword Gabriel and he said father have you look down there there the they're the Seed of Abraham and they believe in you and they prayed all night long and they're going right into the death and let me go down there and I'll change the scene what I want to say there is listen you're not ever alone you're never alone you've got Angels guarding for you and watching over for you and negotiating with God that's right brother says and I believe he could have done it and he said that's right Gabriel you're a good Angel just stand there and here comes another one his name is wormwood he's the angel over against the waters and he over the waters he said I can see him standing attention he said father have you looked down at babon yeah I watched them all night his eyes on the sparrow and I know he's watching me I've watched them all night they're fixing to burn three men up down there this morning the seeds of Abraham that's took you at your word and standing there on it he said you know one time you told me to turn the waters loose and I have control and you let me go down and I will wash babblin off the map let me go down there I'll wash him off of the map brother BR responds again and he could have done that and I can hear them say that's right wormwood you're a wonderful Angel you did exactly everything that I told you to do that you were created I created you you did that too Gabriel but you know I'm going to go down there myself I like that I'm going to go down there myself this is my job this is my job I love that so many people's given me coffee cups which said God's got this and he does Amen cancer is nothing for God no matter where it's at it it's just nothing for god well brother Ron looks like he'd heal you look around folks do I look like I got cancer the other day we were sitting in the doctor's office and and Connie and I was there and she brought in a young girl looked like she was just old enough to get her get her driver's license and she was looked like she weighed about 100 PBS and and she was very nice and Dr gone says this is a microbiologist engineer and she's got a PhD in in your type of cancer and she's looking at the at the the the cells that's in the cancer that you've got and and and she began to talk about you're a testimony amen you know they they're starting to study how I've lived for 5 years now how I've lived with cancer in my brain and and cancer in my lungs and cancer are in the limp nose they're wanting to know what makes this work cuz we got a lot of other people well I want to tell them Jesus [Applause] Christ that's what makes this work [Applause] a lot of people write me what's the secret potency what is the secret thing that you're taking well I'm not going to Mexico for some specialized redneck treatment and I'm not going to trust some 14y old that's got a new plan to get rid of cancer I I'm not trusting somebody's Grandma somewhere or another I'm trusting God Amen and yes I go to the best doctors but brother random went to the best doctors he went to the Mayo Clinic he took his children to doctors he believed in medicine are you with me but it's poison brother Ron if you take it in the name of Jesus Christ it becomes a Target against the demon that's trying to live in your life but brother Ron I'm trusting God I'm trusting God do something in the time it's kind of like a flood came and a guy got up on the top of his house and he kept screaming God help me God help me God help me and three helicopters came by with and he died and and he got to the gate and he said God I was praying that you'd help me he said I sent three helicopters your way that's right Amen brother brandom said there's a reason I'm doing this for the critic that says don't go to doctors brother brandom took his kids to the doctors he went to the doctors himself this going to take me a minute well brother Ron how do you know all of that I was cleaning a chimney standing in a house of an older gentleman that had a PhD at Virginia Tech and he had a son and he said I just got off the phone with it he don't know nothing about me he said I just got off the phone with my son and he said they're studying conscious and subconscious and he starts down the line he said now he said now sometimes he said you ever dream I said yeah yeah I dream he said some of them are good dreams some of them are bad dreams some of them are nightmares yeah yeah that's right he said it's like you're awake and you're seeing the Saints he said some people see that in color and some people see that in dark and some people see it in images said some don't mean anything in the world he said there was a man that my son is doing a specific study on his conscious and his subconscious laid together and he could see Visions like you and I see dreams amen and said I said Wigan brandom he said that's right how did you know about that hallelujah amen I missed something there that I wanted to say but let me say this to you when your critic tells you that you shouldn't go to the doctor and you sit and take medicine that critic may also be the Mr unbelief amen and let me give you another quote brother brandham said doctors are God's agents on the earth they're God's agents on the earth oh but brother R there're a bunch of hooky spooks you're not listening to Brother brandom come on you're not listening to brother brandom they're God's agents on the earth well brother Ron have you ever seen it work okay you want a story I'll give you a story my father cut his fingers off when we were doing chimney sweeping and I heard the doctor say because it twisted them right off and and I heard the doctor say we'll just go ahead and make stubs out of them' and and and this and he can live it won't be no danger to him and I walked up to that team of doctors four of them standing there and I said we believe that you're God's agents on the earth and we believe if you'll do your job God will do his job when they put his fingers back on two weeks later when they took the the th the the things off all of the bandages off those fingers were not even bruised he he had told my dad said they're going to either be black or they're going to be blue or they're going to be horrible we may have to take them off and when he took the bandages off he started working my daddy's fingers like this because there was another [Applause] physician now wward you're a wonderful Angel and you did just exactly what I told you to do since you were created I created you and you did that too Gabriel and but you know I'm going down there myself this is my job now just when they were getting ready to take their first last step I I can see him stand up with his Priestly robes drop around him where he was setting tonight he said they're bloody make an intercession Upon Our confession for he died to bring to pass anything that we asked for where is our faith and that is in him and there he stands motions this way motions that way and here comes a great big cloud White Cloud by him he steps upon it and he calls for the East Wind The North Wind and the south wind and the West Wind to drive them like horses and he reaches up and grips a h of a zigzag lightning brother and I'd like that quote just look up zigzag and crack it across the skies and before they could ever step in step in there he was in the furnace amen he was in the fiery furnace with him he stood in there with a great big Palm fan and somewhere like a big tree of life Fanning the fiery blazes off of them like that and said I just want to talk it over with your with my children he said I know that you're the Seed of Abraham and I gave the promise and I'm here to answer it he kept those fire blazes off of them and they opened it up and said how many do you put in there three and he said there's more down in there and he looks at the Son of God he was he said why they after they was tried they possessed the Gate of their enemy are you with me what about Daniel when he's placed in there with a bunch of hungry lines Hallelujah and the pillar of fire the angels of God that was standing there with him maybe he couldn't see it but those lines laid down and I believe if they laid down it's a good place to put your head boo devil boo devil what about Moses when he was standing there at the Red Sea you talk about some tight spots God knows how to put us in tight spots when he was crying out to God and God spoke to him why are you crying speak and go forward brother BR said God loves to do that God loves to show you his hand his hand Mighty he does he likes to show you his power he's waiting tonight to show it in you yes sir in you I want you to put your hand on your chest right now right here's the guy that he's talking about God wants to show his power in you you amen how old are you how old are you what' he say nine I was about your age at nine and there was a bird that had flew into a window and had died I was listening to the prophet I was listening to my daddy and I took that bird in my hand and I started stroking that bird and I heard what brother brandom talk about squirrels and I heard what he talked about little fish and you know I I just started rubbing that that that little bird and and I just kept rubbing him and I kept praying and all of a sudden that bird went amen so you don't have to be 52 years old come on you can be nine 9 years old ain't that right Teddy you can be you can be your age amen I was with you when you decided to take your glasses off and believe God at his promise we was in Louisiana you know what the devil whispered in my ear it's just emotion you've just got him worked up and there he's going to be blind if he don't wear his glasses brother Teddy won't you stand up there [Applause] he's named for a great man named Teddy I just so happen to look like him well brother Ron these are just isolated cases okay okay Zoe I wish she would sing for us this morning Zoe couldn't talk last year but this year when we took her on vacation she wouldn't shut [Applause] up and I cautioned every person that was around that wanted her to be quiet this is a miracle this is a miracle this is what we prayed for Wesley I don't know how fast he runs but he's a runner he's all over the place I bet when he falls down the steps he may have missed a step but when he's running up those steps and you're you're trying your best to caution him be you be safe be safe well that's what you prayed for you prayed that he would be able to walk Come On Church are you with me now I'm preaching to you I'm

all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed listen if this ain't Sodom if this isn't Sodom if a America hasn't turned to Sodom amen you don't have to look around very long you don't have to look around very long this is Sodom folks look at her a moral condition don't even know what gender that they are are you with me I know there's a lot of new ones among us but abortion still murder it's still murder and somebody's going to have to give account for it and I'm not telling you politics right now it's still murder and you ought to thank God today that you are not one of those dead [Music] fetus now notice this next verse in that day he which is upon the upon the Housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down and to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back these are three great big words and I want you to say them with us remember Lot's wife we're preaching on being on the mark you know there A lot of times people serve the Lord on a fence amen oh Sunday they're one way and Monday they're another way are there you know they got two closets one for Christian and one for they got two radio stations one for they got I'm GNA Keep On movies and movies and songs and songs jokes and jokes brother Michael Ray just preached a sermon on being sold out amen All or Nothing right he just preached you can go and listen to it all or nothing I want to say this to you I want all in I'm not serving God and doing it 50% or 75% I'm all in I'm all in when I led my brother to the Lord and it was standing on the porch and I said Mark tell me what is so important to miss the Rapture he was on his way to being a professional bowler he was incredible I tell me I tell me what girl tell me what bowling game his bowling partner got killed about a month after that bow a game and somebody thought it was wrong they shot him with a 9 millimeter rifle getting in the 9 MIM P pistol getting in in his car what's worth it what's worth it are you with me now there ain't nothing worth it staying here amen if you had Elon musk's money there's no way that I'd trade places with him no way boy that's crazy brother Ron I wouldn't trade with George Clooney I wouldn't trade with no Hollywood figure no way baby what God has GI me is greater than this world [Applause] brother Thomas I was thinking as I was putting these sermon notes together we're getting ready to have a beautiful wedding in your family the other day when things were announced in the field and there was an eagle sat down in the tree right above the happenings that don't just happen at our part of the world Amen there's people that's got Eagles all around but an eagle sit down right right there we don't know how our loved ones watch but this is probably two years ago or three years ago I got you in Sister Nancy's house said Thomas I want to tell you something I saw a vision at brother Danny stamens and everything is going to be all right amen when things look look absolutely impossible for a child of God God's got it in his hands I want to say I said that to say this to you your situation may look impossible amen the trouble in your life may look impossible pay attention to this part that's right sister Debbie this is a good spot if may look impossible but I want you to know God already knows the end from the beginning he's not looking at your failures and you're stumbling around and he's not he's not what we look at as human beings when we start throwing stones at each other he's looking at the end and when you're on the mark you keep his Focus you keep looking at what God's looking looking at you keep looking at the promise I walked out of the pull pit last week and I was so sick and so weak I'll be honest with you I was so weak I couldn't hardly stand it I had stepped off I think I stepped off there and and I thought Lord how in the world am I going to get up those steps we got in the car we woo we got in the car and we got about 10 minutes from home and brother kayin Singh from from South Africa wrote me a note can I call you can I call you he never called me we've exchanged notes and he said can I call you wrote it about two or three times and I said certainly absolutely you can call me cuz God laid it on his heart I want to hear what God's got to say he said brother Ron I was standing in the shower I was standing in the shower and God spoke to me call Ron Spencer he began to pray for me on the phone he said I'm not calling you to have a conversation I'm going to pray for you and he began to pray for me on the phone and sister Connie is the witness the presence of God dropped in our car Hallelujah he dropped in our car God will help you overcome anywhere anytime under any condition that's my God that's my God [Applause] hallelujah I had six five or six different appointments this week week one by phone they're great doctors but the greatest one call me on Sunday the greatest one I'm I'm telling this for a reason the greatest one called me on Sunday and reminded me I got this Lord why you keep telling stuff like that brother Ron listen let this give faith to you right when you're seeing your doctor and your lawyer and your situation your Banker God's got it God's got it now brother brandom says you don't know how it feels you know when where you're at then all the Devils out of hell if he lined up everyone thing there that was in hell up around it would never stop that it's there it's got to happen I want to drop that note there for a reason brother Bram uses this quote after that little Finnish Boy comes up off of the ground and brother Bram said you could line up every devil in hell when you know where you are right when you know where you are and God's told you what's going to go on I feel like shouting right now now when you know where you are you could line up every devil in hell that's a huge statement that's a Monumental [Applause] statement and this comes from a prophet of God that says if I'm not right may God strike me dead and right after he tells that statement listen he knows where he stand we've never had a message like we've had we've never had a prophet on the earth since the days of Jesus like we had in this age never had one that could stand there and tell you who you are where you come from what your condition is what the doctor told you never miss not guessing not reading your mind never miss I don't know so much about it did one of those come out of your denomination come on then don't be critic of the message well I'm going to walk away where you going where you going where you going I'll tell you where you're going You're to fall off a [Applause] cliff show me 5 years after you walk away from the message that you're better off I'll tell you we've watched it you're not better off why are you being so strong let me be one of the last voices that even if they hear this message today let me be the last voice come home come back home come back home don't be left behind while there's still hope while there's still a chance why there's still a moment that you can run to this altar come home I've got just a couple more minutes here cuz I got to deal with it brother Ron if I come back you'll treat me bad give me an example give me an example on give me an example I'm GNA point point blank Melissa did I treat you ever bad did I ever say a rough word to you ever in your worst days did I ever treat you bad did I ever treat you you bad did I ever did I ever treat you bad Megan I preached your wedding I treated you like my daughter did I ever treat you bad Tom did I ever treat you bad Jimmy we sat many times many times did I ever put you down I treated you like a best friend amen Cassie this may be a sticker but have we ever talk bad about your parents ever at our table what are you doing that for brother Ron cuz I'm showing you there's still hope [Applause] and I not want only want to be that way I want you to be that way this message is full of hope this message is infiltrated in every line full of grace full of Hope but brother Ron there's places where he's just really rough do you realize where he's at he's trying to get them out of some of those spots he's trying to bring them out of their denominations Amen brother Andrew I can't imagine the responsibility that God speaks to you and you're a prophet and you know today is not going to be a day to where you preach on shouting on and you know that David is is a representation of the Lord himself and you know God's blessed David but God's revealed to you that he's killed another man and taken his wife and she's pregnant and today you're going to preach a sermon called Thou Art the man here's the difficult thing if David covers it up before a prophet God could kill him he could kill him right there he's God's prophet and God's Prophet is greater than any King on the earth let me say this to you have God called me to go to the president of the United States of America and preach a sermon and he gave me access I would preach what God spoke to me to preach I'm just dead honest and Nathan walks in and he begins to talk about a sheep one man's got a whole lot of sheep and one man's got one boy this sermon was stirring it was incredible stirring move David and he told him that the man that had all all of these sheep went down and took this man that only had one now listen this sermon stirs all of all of us get stirred by sermons they move us one way or another brother BR said I can see by your face you know some sermons make you happy some cause you to remorse or some some different things he said I can watch your face and David is listening to to Nathan preach knowing he's a prophet and David knows there's something got to be done and he said whoever did this got to die whoever did this has got to die and then he announces his text David thou are the manen brother Doug if you look at it David could have had Nathan killed he had UAH killed he could have had he could have had Nathan killed and Nathan would have never preached another sermon so what's the important part right here having Nathan killed is it's kind of like turning off your preacher and saying I'm not going to listen to him no more amen and God has given you an access now watch his watch him watch what David does he immediately repents David's got innocent blood on his hands brother brandom talks about what what will you do with this Jesus called Christ he's talking to preachers he's talking to men that handle the word you got Christ on your hands you got people on your hands now let's flip this and sit down there you got children on your hands be the best father that you can be be the best mother that you can be yes I understand there's troubles and I understand there's Sorrows but be on the mark be on the Mark I understand trouble I understand trouble I understand sorrow but be the best that you can be be the best that you can be brother Ron give me an example there's not a service that I walk out and begin to preach to you that I just want to get by on Sunday morning lord well how important is one service let me bring it up Matthew was preaching on a Sunday morning and you're son walks in and sits beside of you and listens to the service and that evening dies in a car crash and he dies in your yard amen how important is one service how important is one service brother Marcus how important is one chance meeting you talking about predestination you talking about predestination 20 years I would preach and tell your story looking for you and here you wind up sitting in my church to preach to how do you get him off an airplane 20 years ago and have him sitting right there I tell you it's called predestination God comes looking for you brother Ron and he knows how to find you cuz you're really not lost you're really not lost you may be wandering around in a desert somewhere or another but he knows exactly where to have your burning bush he knows exactly where to come and get you Brother Don and he's not even worried about your past he knows all of that but he knows exactly where to meet you how to come get you cuz he's got plans for you in your life he's got a future for you he's got a future for you let's stand to our feet this morning is the Olympics going on right now Friday I just knew that they were going on

they went to witness that baptism and brother bam said that Angels was hanging on every tree there that entire congregation they begin to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we see this

God that'll never pass away father he's he's heard the word preached he's read of it he's he's heard the prophet speak but Lord he's wanting you Lord to come and fill his life so father I stand here
