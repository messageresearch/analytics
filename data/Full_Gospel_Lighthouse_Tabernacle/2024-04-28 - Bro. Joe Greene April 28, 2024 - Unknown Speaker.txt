written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for isaas sayith Lord who hath believed our

might become the Sons and Daughters of God Amen now he goes on to talk about those that have not all obeyed the gospel Isaiah uh questioned Lord who hath believed our report and I'm so glad this morning that I can stand here before a group of people that has believed the report of the Lord amen a people that have accepted what God has sent in this hour realizing amen as we'll get to just in in a little while Lord willing amen that God has a word a message for every generation amen for every age if you will amen but yet in in God providing that there are still those amen that have not heard there are still those amen that have heard and they have rejected this morning amen they've turned down but I'm so glad this morning that God has made a way that you and I can allow Faith to rais in our hearts amen faith is actually brought to us this morning by the preaching of the word amen Romans 10:17 said so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen and as we look and we realize this morning that the word amen is what stimulates us amen it's what gives us hope this morning amen without the word of God where we wouldn't know where we're at we wouldn't know what what kind of condition we're in but thank God brother Jordan it's the word of God that that by the stimulation of the revelation of the word of God Amen that God reveals himself to us this morning amen and we're so thankful that for that and it's not just a dead letter word you know uh their home we have the builtmore house and maybe some of you have been there but they have one of the biggest libraries in the eastern part of the United States amen and some of those books are hundreds of years old amen but there's not one of those except it be the Bible amen that has anything in it that can help us oh it might help us in our desk and our our task and our daily jobs and our daily uh routines and all of that but it cannot give us e eternal life amen but this word that we're speaking about this morning that we want to hear that Faith might be built in our hearts it is a living manifesting word amen and it's the true preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen now I want you to realize this morning it's the quickened word is where God's people are called to this morning do you realize amen that you know there there's churches across the land today and around the world Amen that they preach as brother Josh Bennett preached yesterday at the tent meeting amen they're preaching traditions and dogmas of men but I'm so glad this morning amen that I'm not bound up in a bunch of traditions amen I'm so glad that God didn't give us a bunch of traditions to make it in amen thank God he give us a living word amen that can transform our lives this morning and and make a new creation out of us amen now I want you to realize God has done a wonderful thing in that he brings his word in Seasons amen a and we realize that a true man of God that's called in a certain season or a certain time amen he'll only preach the word that's given in that season and For That season now there's a lot of preachers out there but again they're preaching traditions and dogmas and and rituals and formalities amen but brother do we we have a message today amen that is a living reality of Jesus Christ in this hour amen and I believe this morning you have ministers here amen that that's the kind of God they preach about that's the kind of word that they live before you this morning amen now the prophet of God would tell us in the message God's provided way of healing he said now we can preach the word we can explain the word but you have to receive the word amen oh Hallelujah he says that's what sets it a fire brother when you receive it the Revelation something slips out of the Unseen World y under it comes rolling down through a mystical Channel somewhere into your soul amen that says now I see it amen your eyes brighten your lips that hung down they straighten up and smile every muscle in your body seems to Rejoice something's going to happen amen you don't need to be in a prayer line then you've got it amen and I believe this morning that's what we need in this hour amen it's some more divine revelation how do you get it by the hearing of the word because that builds faith in your heart for God to come down and speak to you this morning morning amen and give you what you need now what we want to realize is that there is an inspiration in the Revelation for this day and that inspiration in that Revelation is what brings stimulation in our hearts amen and causes us this morning to react to the word of God and not reject it but react to it amen receiving into our hearts and allowing that word to tr transform us into the very image of Jesus Christ this morning amen now Daniel 12 and verse 9 it tells us as God uh began to show Daniel things and visions and so forth amen and Daniel was trying to understand it and figure it out amen but the the the spirit of God said to him seal it up amen because this is not available or not for this time it's for the time of the end amen now I want you to realize this morning how many believes we're living in the end time we're not in the beginning of the church ages we're not in the beginning amen of time we are in the fullness of time well praise the lord we are at the ending of the Gentile dispensation amen we're at a time where just any day now the Lord Jesus is going to come and receive us unto himself amen he went away but he but he promised if I go away I'll come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also amen and I'm looking for that promise to be fulfilled just any day now amen because the scripture tells us in Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets now Daniel received uh uh some inspiration he received some Revelation he received in in symbol form amen he couldn't understand it amen or couldn't detail what it was but God said save that seal it in a book because it's for the time of the end but I want you to understand if God sealed it for a certain specific time then let me assure you God is going to reveal it in the set time that it's designed for and I believe this morning that's what God has done in Our Generation by sending a word Prophet this morning amen not just another uh uh you know Prophet from the fivefold ministry but a word Prophet amen that come with the word of God for a generation well y'all help me preach this morning Amen to come for it came for us in this hour Malachi 45 and6 said behold I S unto you how many yous do we have here this morning amen so the word that God sent through that Malachi 4 Ministry it was for me this morning amen and the things that were preached through that Ministry it was for me now you all can put your name in there if you want to but I am declaring to you this morning that message that God has sent in this day it was sent directly to me this morning brother Shannon amen and by the grace of God Amen when I heard that amen I know it's real because it was quick to my heart amen now listen I want you to understand my dad was in the meetings he said in about 21 or so different Services where brother Brandon preached amen and heard the voice of God speak through him amen but I'm not following this message because my daddy did I'm not following it because I heard it all my life I'm following it because it has been a divine revelation to me brother Andrew and this message is going to change my body amen because this message is nothing less than Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen it's not a dead message this morning it's a Living Word of God Amen that's going to transform us and translate us into another dimension amen now the scripture tells us in Psalms 102 when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in glory now we realize this morning amen that this church that God is building amen he's not going to build it to get the church's Glory but he's going to build it to give himself Glory because he said in his word I will not share my glory with any man amen so he's not doing it to give any preacher Glory he's not doing it to give any ministry glory this morning he is building a church for his name sake this morning amen and and he's living in that church that that church might display amen a living God this morning amen now we realize down Through the Ages the Dark Ages it seemed like the church had died out it seemed like there was nothing there it seemed like it was just going to fade away amen but then we see a Revival Amen on the zeusa street the outpouring of the Holy Ghost amen and then we see the prophet of God come on the scene and begin to declare thus sayeth the Lord and begin to uhh catch the revelation of the word of God as God began to open it to him and allow him to see amen and catch that Revelation let me tell you this morning amen when I sit and listened to the prophet of God and hear and preach on the seals of the church ages hear and preach on Amen zakus the businessman hearing preaching on Amen the the the faith cometh by hearing amen and you hear those things and recognize today amen that those messages they're not sent to the denominational world they're not sent to the churchianity group this morning they are sent to the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and I I I I hear the prophet say I believe God has allowed me to to to deliver a message that will dress the bride Amen in the wedding Garment of the word amen not a not a garment of silk and fashion of this world but a wedding Garment of the word this morning amen and not only that but through that Ministry through that visitation God has United the bride and Christ this morning amen and we have become one with him now if I preach anything contrary to what your pastors do amen you talk to them afterwards and listen to what they tell you I don't believe I will though now the scripture said Brother David that in John 12: 24 verily verily I say unto you except the corner wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit now I want you to realize down Through the Ages it seemed like it was dead seemed like it was dried up didn't seem like God was doing anything amen but I want you to understand also this morning amen that at the right season amen at the right time amen that word began to germinate it began to come back to life amen why because the life was in the seed and the seed is the word of God this morning amen and when that seed comes forth what's he going to do it is going to produce fruit this morning well brother Joe where's that fruit I'm looking at it this morning you are what this message is producing you are why God sent this message amen now uh that one grain of corn I know some of you in here are farmers and plant a little Garden or a big Garden I don't know which but anyways whenever you plant that and you row you plant one or two kernels of corn one or two kernels of corn one or two kernels of corn amen but when that grows and produces an ear of corn how many kernels are on the three or four five years that's on that one stock coming from those one or two to seeds this morning and I want you to realize what looked like was nothing what looked like was just lost amen thank God this morning it has produced a bride amen Universal around the world this morning that is standing for the true word of God and she will not accept Creed she will not accept Dogma she will not accept traditions of men because why she is a word seed bride this morning amen now we realize God deals with Israel as a nation and he has dealt with her and give her an opportunity amen and she turned him down she refused to accept him she said away with him crucify him amen let his blood be upon us and upon our children and let me tell you they're still battling that today amen but thank God Amen God because she rejected the word of God because she turned him down God said I will have a bride amen and he turned to the Gentiles amen and because he turned to the Gentiles that's why you and I can sit here this morning and rejoice in the word of God realizing amen just like Ruth and Naomi amen when they they their husbands died and they went back as poppers as Beggars amen basically having nothing but thank God this morning amen men when she began to glean in the field of Boaz amen after a little while he recognized her amen as that wi woman that came back with Naomi and he understood amen she's not here amen just for no purpose but God has a plan this morning and I want you to realize you may be the off scaring of the world they may not think much of you but I want you to understand God thought so much of you this morning that he forsook his own people because they reject Reed him and he came and he found you this morning [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah they turned him down amen they they rejected him brother Joel amen but there's something in the true bride of Jesus Christ that was for ordained and predestinated amen to be a part of the bride of Christ in this hour she cannot turn him down because she is bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit life of his life amen and she is one with him and she had that representation before the foundation of the world oh they saw Israel saw the manifestation of the Son of God right they saw the son of man stand there reveal the secrets of the hearts they saw the son of man the Lord Jesus they saw him heal the sick raise the Dead cast out Devils they saw him do all those Mighty Works among them but yet there was nothing in them to believe it they rejected it they turned them down but then the scripture tells us in Luke 17:30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now that was the son of God he called himself the son of man amen and then they turned him down but then God has a revealing of the son of man in the last Gentile dispensation Amen in the last agees morning amen and because there's something inside of the Bride this morning amen something in side of the people that make up the bride amen they will accept that and they will receive that this morning because they recognize it not a little Kentucky hillbilly about 135 LBS or so amen that's not who it was it was God Almighty amen the son of man himself amen revealing himself through a son of man is this all right amen but they they they had something in them to recognize that as I said my dad was in 20-some meetings or services that the prophet preached and the first service that he was in he never hurt brother Bram Minister never seen him in all of his years he he he heard Allan and Co and Roberts and osbor and all the great names up and down the East Coast listening to all of them he said but when I said in the auditorium and brother bam came through the door before he said evening friends dad said I found myself just Weeping at the presence of God that came with him listen that wasn't William brandham that was the god that walked with him and stood by his side around the world Amen and and dad said when I got my composure I looked around and everybody around me was in the same condition I amen and from that time amen 1956 dad began to follow the ministry and the teachings of the prophet of God because he recognized there's more than just a a a denominational evangelist amen there is something behind that Ministry amen that declared Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever not just by words but by actions this morning by the life of Jesus Christ Christ being manifested through that gift through that Ministry this morning and I believe amen not only did it work through that man and through that Ministry but it's working through the bride of Christ in this hour because listen this morning we're not preaching another message we're not led by another spirit amen we have the same Holy Spirit when brother Bron was taken off the scene many of the preachers that dad was associated with called him brother green what we going to do the prophet's gone uh we we have no leader and and not that he was a bishop or a leader or anything in that regard amen but he had thus sayith the Lord amen what are we going to do brother green the prophet's no longer with us he's dead amen the dad said we got the Holy Ghost we've got the message that he brought we got the word of God Amen and so listen this morning I'm not following a man as much as I love brother Ron if you're here following brother Ron you're in the wrong this morning I don't care how gifted these men are don't follow them follow the Christ that lives inside of them this morning because the Christ will not lead you astray the Christ will lead you to a body change this morning the Christ will translate you into another world this morning they can't do it they can preach the word and build up your faith this morning but they can't change your body amen but the god that they preach to you about that God can do it this morning let me give you a little secret that God will do it if you believe the promises of the word of God and accept them into your heart this morning job would pray chapter 14: 13 oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave that thou wouldest keep me secret until thy wrath be passed that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me now brother job he had a hard time he had a lot of battles had balls from the top of his head to the SES of his feet lost his children as brother do my Sunday school teacher amen always likes to say job had a textile business with the Sheep he had a transportation business with the camels amen he had a a a moving business or a transport business with the donkeys or asses amen and he had all those kind of business he lost it all that's right he lost his children all he had left was a nagging wife excuse me sisters amen that's said why don't you curse God and die not that you are amen I'm not saying that but she said why don't you curse God and die listen this morning the devil don't care who he Lo uses he'll use the love of your life to get you all out of sorts if they let him but that's why we all got to keep our mind stayed on him so that we don't yield oursel to the devil this morning amen but job recognized amen he saw all the flowers and and the trees and all amen go through their cycle of Life they raise up then they die out go back to the dust of the earth amen and job realized amen I you know what happens to a man amen and when he dies does he just disappear and never uh to return again but then job called a revelation amen if a man die shall he live again amen and job called a amen even though the skin worms destroy my flesh yet in my flesh shall I see God job was looking ahead to a time of Resurrection amen when Jesus Christ arose and led captivity captive and brought amen the souls that were that were in in in in lost the word amen in in the place that the the dead went to at that time amen he and he led them out of there right he St snatched the keys of death hell and the grave from Satan and set them free amen they were seen in the streets of Jerusalem amen for many days there as as the time for his Ascension came amen and as brother bam talked about Abraham and Sarah walking through the old city looking and seeing what was there and how it had changed and all those things amen then somebody recognized that looks like what I've heard Abraham looks like let me tell you this morning I'm looking some for my dad to come and sit down at the table with me I'm looking for brother Dan to come I'm looking for brother Homer you to call me and tell me brother Homer I saw him this morning amen why because I believe there is coming another Resurrection amen where the dead in Christ shall rise amen and then after that we shall all be chained in a moment in a twinkling of an eye caught up together to meet the Lord in the air oh that set time that job was looking for it came he was resurrected and he was received up to to the Lord there as the the scripture talks about but I want you to understand this morning we have a set time that we're going to be changed the dead are going to rise amen but there's also a set time for the word for this dispensation amen and I want you to realize this morning this is the time of the favor of God God is looking for men who will yield themselves and let God preach through them you know sometimes sometimes you have well it's like our camp meeting we have in August which by the way your your pastor has committed to preach part of that meeting along with brother Josh Bennett this year so hope you can make it amen but anyways when it comes to camp meeting you know everybody's wanting to know who's going to preach tonight Who's going to preach this service in the mornings when the missionaries speak who's going to preach this morning and my response is the Holy Ghost now what vessel he uses amen he maybe he hadn't told me at that time and I'm just waiting for the direction amen but but what we want today is Holy Ghost L men that can get themselves out of the way and let the Holy Ghost do the preaching many times you hear the brother say the preacher's here this morning and he ain't talking about the man standing here he's talking about him amen now God looking for those men that will step aside and let God use their voices let God use their their tongues this morning now we got to realize what God is is doing in our day and what he's doing in the word amen he's giving an impact and an effect Upon Our Lives now I I've been here enough over the years and I've I've watched your services I appreciate them so very much but I I I've seen the growth thank you and I've seen you people come coming in new people moving in amen and and and what what is attracting you to come here it's not the man welcome brother I feel like I'm a part of the family here it's not the man it's the god that works through the man and it's the word that God pre preaches through the man that's what is drawing you the power of a resurrected Christ the life of Jesus Christ that is manifested through the preaching of the word and through the life that is lived this morning so we got to recognize what God is doing so that it may have an impact and an effect Upon Our Lives if we don't recognize it you know I use the illustration sometimes I pull out a certain piece of money and I I I say I'm going to give it away I'm not going to do that this morning so don't get excited I don't say who I'm going to give it to I'm going to give it away I'm just waiting on somebody to catch the Revelation so if it's a $20 bill whoever catches the Revelation that I'm going to give it away comes and gets it and if you know the rest of the church don't catch the Revelation they're still sitting in their seats but the one that caught the Revelation comes and gets it you understand what I'm saying that's the way it is with the things of God this morning you've got to catch the Revelation that God has made a way and that God has sent a message for you this morning amen and that that message will bring you to a trans ation now do you realize this morning that the Saints of old desired to hear what you hear they longed just like Daniel he wanted to know what what was given to him in that in that symbol form he wanted to understand it he wanted to catch that Revelation but God said seal it up because it's for the time of the end maybe he he caught some glimpse of it and understand understanding of it but God said it's not time for that it's it's for a later season amen now when when Jesus came and he preached his little sermonette if you will Amen in Luke 4 the spirit of the Lord is upon me Amen to preach the gospel and so forth amen what Jesus did he being the word brother Randy he recognized himself in the word yes yes sir and he declared himself in the word to the people amen now they didn't catch it but he knew he knew his position in the word of God and I believe this morning that's what God is trying to get us to is to understand our position that's why I ask you how many yous do we have in here because when you recognize that that God sent a prophet just to you you know how much I believe God sent a prophet to me so much that if I was the only one that needed to hear what he had to say God would send him for me oh brother Joe that that's putting a lot of emphasis on you no it's not it's putting a lot of emphasis on God keeping his seed and protecting his seed and bringing them what they need for the hour in which they living in now listen he's he's he said here the spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the word of God to set at Liberty the captive and so forth amen and and I want you to realize until that time amen it took a sounding of a trumpet to declare Liberty the children of Israel under the law of of Moses amen the Old levitical Law amen when they had their their Year of Jubilee and the trumpet sounded it didn't matter what they were doing amen if they were hoing the corn or or thrashing the wheed or plucking The Grapes off the vine or the olives whatever it was amen when they heard that amen they recognized there is a liberty I've been serving this man I've sold him my uh my property and bound myself to serve him for all this time but now whether it was one day or 49 years 364 days amen they were bound under that rule amen under that bondage and they couldn't go free but when that trumpet sounded let me tell you it didn't matter brother William amen what they were doing they recognized the sound of Liberty amen and when they heard that trumpet blowing listen they threw their hole down they threw the rake down they throw their their seats down or whatever tool they were using and said I'm free I'm free thank God I'm free and they went back to their possession back to their inheritance amen but oh let me tell you Jesus said amen that I've come to set at Liberty them that are bound amen and until that time it was it was the old levitical trumpet sounding amen but I want you to realize now the gospel of Jesus Christ is the trumpet that we need to hear today amen because that is what set you free from your sins that is what called you out of sin bondage this morning that is what has given you Liberty amen and I want you to realize today what's the difference between you and all the rest of the 8 billion people plus up on the face of the Earth that don't even acknowledge God you know what the difference is you have accepted your Liberty you have accepted what God has given you this morning amen and when you heard the sound of Liberty what did you do thank God I'm free I'm free I'm free amen thank God the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free this morning and by that freedom thank God you're no longer bound to denominational ideas you're no longer bound to to the traditions of men thank God you are free and you walk in the liberty of the word of God this morning and I got good news for you John 8:36 said if the sun therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed amen couple years ago I'd been over in South Carolina to the hospital there to visit a brother that had some surgery and I was coming back and I was just thinking about the brother and the situation praying for him as I was coming down the road there and all of a sudden on the side of the road said uh said a brother Gabriel some of you'll catch it some of you won't but brother Ronnie when I come down there right now down a little Hill and I was just thinking on other things had my mind somewhere besides driving down the road amen and and as I went by him I realized uhoh and I saw him pull out and I said here he comes so I pulled over let him come up behind me and so forth and you know he of course he checked my record checked my plates and all of that and come up said uh are you in a hurry where you been what you've been doing so forth and and you know how they do and uh so I I told him I said well I I just had my mind elsewhere and so forth so so I didn't just wasn't really watching amen and so he went back to the car and look my license up I guess or whatever they do and and then he come back and said well Mr Green said uh said you've got a pretty exemplary record for your driving said I'm just going to give you a warning and encourage you to slow down this morning I said Thank God I'm free thank God I'm free this morning now I I shared that with you this morning to to help you to realize when Jesus died on the cross when he was hanging there and and and I I know y'all probably heard this more than likely you have amen he he he began to declare and speak the famous last words my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me and then on and on and and his final words were it is finished now not only did he pay the price but he expunged the record amen I I'm I'm no longer guilty as brother randam talked about he said you know you say you want to forgive me for something that you heard that I did and I tell you I didn't do it I got witnesses that I didn't do it amen and so forth and you can't forgive me for something that I didn't do I want you to realize this morning I was a sinner I was lost I was undone without God but he forgave me this morning and when he cried out it is finished on the cross that is a declaration the debt is paid the job is done Redemption is paid for amen and and and when when when he declared that I recognized the Liberty that he has given me he has set me free from sin this morning and sin no longer has hold on me this morning amen now we realize this morning as the trumpet of Liberty sounded only the sons could go free oh sir that's back in the Old Testament it was only those in the generations of Abraham Isaac and Jacob that were rightful hirs to The Inheritance right now there were some servants I'm I'm trying to hurry cuz I know we got a busy day you you pull so I'll preach fast fasor there were some servants that had their ears bored through with an awe and when they did that there was no liberty for them there was no Freedom awaiting them on the Year of Jubilee there was no way that they could go free because they have been bored through with an all and they were lifetime servants to the Master but thank God brother Jordan amen I didn't stoop that far to get my ear bored through with an o thank God I heard an eagle scream and that eagle cry amen what did it do this morning it let me hear and look up and look where that voice was coming from yeah amen and by the grace of God not only did I hear the voice but I recognize I can got some wings that I can flap this morning amen and I begin to Flap my wings and thank God I rose up a little bit higher amen and I'm no longer bound this morning I'm no longer a slave to sin thank God I'm free this morning by the grace of God I have been delivered and I'm no more Bound by sin this morning but the only way I could be delivered is because I was already a son well brother Joe yeah I was already a son how how do you get that brother Joe because I was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and I want you to realize this morning friend that the great plan of God it was to show me the grace of God it was to allow me to experience that listen the angels of God the cherim the seraphim and all of those Angelic beings they're walking around and around the Throne of God holy holy holy Lord God Almighty they're praising him day and night but brother Ernie they were created for that purpose to praise him but I want you to understand something this morning you and I choose to praise him and why do we choose to praise him but because we realize this morning what God has done and we recognize the grace of God that come into our life oh let me tell you this morning friend I I I was raised in this message thank God I've never experienced a a denominational background I've never experienced being Bond bondaged under traditions of men amen and all those kind of things I I thank God for that amen but I I I deal with people people all the time as pastor and and as when I was in the The Working World amen I I seen people and they were so bound and so in bondage to their system of religion and their Traditions amen but I I I want you to realize this morning it's the grace of God listen when D when dad was a young Preacher Brother Ron the the Church of God really got after him his his older brother at the time was associated with Church of God if my memories serves me correctly and and others around him they tried to get him because my dad was a dynamic dynamic preacher not not because he was my dad but someone was testifying yesterday about the ministry and how it had had blessed him in such a way amen but Dad was a dynamic preacher amen and uh brother brother do sister Linda they'll remember and and Betty my sister they'll remember the Dynamics of his preaching brother do amen you testify to that and so forth amen and they they wanted him he was when when Dad accepted the truth of jesus' name or baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he had 16 revivals scheduled is that the right number bet he help me remember okay 16 17 revivals amen and and brother do whenever he he was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen every one of them cancelled oh just we don't want you anymore because you took the name of Jesus Christ amen so so what did daddy do he just kept preaching amen pre preaching tent meetings and he'd go places he went one place to stay five nights he stayed five weeks and five nights the Lord working the Lord moving the Lord healing people and delivering people amen I I know brother do and sister Linda they cut their teeth and did their dating going to Church five nights a week following hearing my dad preach tent meetings and revivals here and there and everywhere amen but ain't nothing wrong

and that the word will eventually change you and guess what God has an executive called the holy spirit that enforces the rights of that will this morning amen and he's here to enforce it today Amen

on brother bam said amen and I I I reiterate this morning if you want to be free Cut Loose some all things come on Amen and serve him now the day of unbelief is finished the day of sin is finished the seventh seal has been opened in this day amen well brother Joe we don't know what that that that that time of Silence we we realize that's the Rapture right amen so it it all things have been revealed through the opening of the seals this morning amen it opens up the mind of God and brings an end to servitude of sin in our lives amen it ends the bondage of not knowing who we are now listen you know for some time as I was growing up I didn't think I looked like my daddy I didn't but brother Ron the older get I look at my hands and I see Daddy I hear myself preaching which I don't like to do that but sometimes I have to go back and listen to something and I sound like my daddy certain things I do it's like my daddy and I can't help that because it's in me and I I know most of you know this but let me get through here my my little grandson Charlie he's here this morning and my son Nathaniel and I we were all born with a sixth digit on each hand now the doctors asked my daddy when we had Nathaniel's removed uh he said are you the grandfather yes did you have it no do you know anybody in your family history that had it no he said well somewhere in the gym jeans that was was dormant but then it was made manifest in me and then in Nathaniel And now in Charlie amen because because it was a part of the of the Jean Pool well I I just like to tell you the reason you came to the truth of the hour is because you were in the Jean Pool this morning and the Gable it was I didn't see you a while ago it wasn't nothing you done it wasn't nothing you done brother Titus it was nothing any of you done this morning it's because you were in the Jean Pool and you had to be manifest you had to come forth this morning amen because you were there amen now we realize the message of the hour this morning is a message of Deliverance it's a message of sunship and it was sent to destroy the works of the devil amen and it's filled your mind and your heart and I heard brother Ron say this morning amen when when he gets back to full speed and gets back into the pull pit full force that the devil better look out I want you to realize this morning amen that you and I with this message living in us the devil better look out when we realize listen brother brandham taught us amen through the message of the hour when this bride recognizes what she is she will be an invincible Army so what I'm looking for is to know what I am I hope you're looking for the same thing and what I am is God influ flesh where where do God dwell anybody know well I I see a few hands he dwells right here so where is God God is in flesh he works through listen God has no hands but ours no feet but ours no no eyes but ours I mean he sees everything but he he he works through the the the medium of humanity amen now listen we can no longer say we can't make it Hallelujah we can no longer say we can't do it because we've heard this message of Deliverance amen and Liberty and by hearing this message of Deliverance and Liberty it gives us the reality and the Revel ation amen that we are as much a part of God as God is himself and I want you to look up here at me everybody looking don't turn away everybody look I can no more be lost than God can because I was in him but Andrew before the foundation of the world Amen listen it's not a message of I'm saved today and lost tomorrow but I am eternally saved if the spirit of God lives inside of me and what is God God is Zoe God's life eternal and if Eternal God lives inside of me that means that I am Eternal now this flesh it's going to have to die sister da brother brother Dan talked to Sister DA they were good buddies and and brother Dan you were pretty pretty well in their later years and brother Dan asked her brother Ron he said sister Dal said uh did you ever ask brother brandham about the Rapture anything she said well yes brother Dan said I I asked brother brandham what was what would it be like for the Rapture when it takes place and brother brandham explained to him to her said well sister sister glattus said it'll be like a quick death be a sharp pain and it'll be over with because why flesh cannot inherit eternal life and listen it's not this body that's going to or or that is eternal but it's the man on the inside that's the Eternal part this morning amen and by the grace of God looking if they ever call and tell you brother Joe has died don't believe it because I can't die brother Noah the house that I live in might quit breathing but I can't die because I have eternal life living and abiding in me oh my listen now the Masters bored the the all through their ears but I want you to understand the devil can't cannot lock you out or pull you out because you're saved for Time and Eternity now I'm not talking about once saved always saved like certain denomination preaches it amen because brother Vernon if they ever truly get saved and born again to the spirit of God Amen it's not in today and out tomorrow but it is an eternal birth this morning amen it's a birth like we should have had before for the fall and we would have had if it hadn't been for the fall in the Garden of Eden amen 1 Corinthians 12:13 for by one Spirit we are are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have all been have been made all have been all made to drink into one Spirit that's the spirit of God God has sealed us until the day of our Redemption that's right listen it's a message of power security and Liberty it's not a message of bondage this bride is being quickened in this age leaving this dark leosa behind and Rising into the Sun the s o n this morning amen the message is the trumpet of God uh to to tell us to go back to whatever is yours Amen brother Ron preached a message take it back amen you have a right to take it back this morning amen because why because you are a son and daughter of God this morning amen go back to if you say to this mountain be removed and cast into the sea you have the right to do that amen your worship go back to it go back to the liberty and listen you don't have no trouble worshiping here you I tell you I love it amen I love to see you guys worship amen and glad to be a distant part of it and a part of it when I'm here listen we're not a bunch of intellectual church leaders amen or church joiners we are the Bride of Jesus Christ how many can say that with me I am the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm not a church Joiner while back I received a letter in the mail from a a local church there and said certain certain person wants you to send us their letter they're they're becoming a part of our church and joining our church I wrote them back and I said we don't do such things that's right I said nowhere in the Bible did it ever say join the church it said you got to be born again so you know that's right and so on Hey listen this morning we're we're behind the veil I know the veil has been rent and and it's been exposed and all that but we're behind the veil in such amen that that we are we we are we're allowing or he is given us those Revelations that are changing us from Moment by moment day by day this is the acceptable year of the Lord is Jesus preach don't matter how long you've been in bondage don't matter how long you've been imprisoned in your mind every band has been broken amen every every bondage amen has been has been broken this morning and freedom Reigns because this message is a message trumpet sounding Liberty we've been set free this morning amen 2 Corinthians 3:17 and I'm going to stop now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty amen but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord and are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so we realize this morning it's not me changing me it's not the preachers changing you it's faith in the word of God that's causing it to become a reality and a true Revelation in your lives this morning amen the message takes us all the way back to the founding Faith founding father of our faith which is Abraham listen I want you to realize Isaac had to enter into the same Revelation as his daddy had right amen but Abraham had such a revelation he knew if he took the life of Isaac that there was a promise that through him amen and we know there was a spiritual side to that too but the natural seed had to come through Isaac amen because he was the son of promise and I want you to realize this morning amen that we have a son of Promise called Jesus Christ amen that through him there is life amen would you stand with us this morning Lord Jesus this morning God how how happy we are how grateful this morning Lord to realize that we're no longer bound we're no longer in bondage but the truth of this message Lord has brought Liberty the spirit of God Lord H has prevailed and in this

we might be Rapture Ready this morning help us father God to to apply the Garment to put it on this morning to take on the word of God and let it live in us today Grant it today Father Lord there's
