[7:09] Let's sing a song. I'm amazed that you
[7:11] love me.
[7:14] [Music]
[7:18] How alone I was feeling
[7:25] and the emptiness I tried so hard to
[7:30] hide.
[7:32] [Music]
[7:34] Though I laughed
[7:37] and said my life was fine without you.
[7:44] I was covering up the secret tears I
[7:51] cried.
[7:54] And one day,
[7:57] oh, someone told me of your mercy.
[8:05] Oh, and the love you showed on a hill
[8:10] called Calvary.
[8:15] There you
[8:19] purchased my redemption.
[8:26] Oh, when you broke sin's power and set
[8:30] my spirit free.
[8:34] [Music]
[8:36] Oh, I'm amazed
[8:41] that you love me.
[8:46] Oh, I'm amazed
[8:51] at how you care.
[8:56] And through your presence,
[9:01] love will I found.

[9:11] are washed.
[9:13] For they all washed away.
[9:17] All my sins
[9:21] are washed
[9:24] away.
[9:26] [Music]
[9:28] Oh yes, it's true.
[9:31] Oh, there have been days when I failed
[9:35] you.
[9:38] And Lord, you know the many times I've
[9:44] called astray.
[9:48] Oh, but I have hurt.
[9:52] Your love is stronger than my weakness.
[9:57] [Music]
[10:00] And your rivers open
[10:04] every time I pray.
[10:10] Well, no one else
[10:14] has ever cared for me like you know.
[10:21] Oh, other friend
[10:24] never be close to me.
[10:31] Oh, I am not afraid
[10:35] to face the problems of tomorrow.

[10:58] Oh, that you love me.
[11:03] Oh, I'm amazed
[11:09] at how you came.

[12:22] are washed.
[12:25] They're all washed away.
[12:29] All my sins
[12:33] are washed
[12:36] away.
[12:39] Amen. Are you thankful for that this
[12:41] morning? Amen. He never promised that
[12:44] the cross would not get heavy.
[12:49] He never promised that the cross would
[12:53] not get heavy
[12:55] and that he would not be hard to
[13:03] [Music]
[13:04] Oh, he never offered
[13:08] a victory without fighting, but he said
[13:13] help would always come
[13:16] time.

[13:40] [Music]
[13:41] cuz our Lord will show up
[13:46] and we take you through the Father
[13:51] again.
[13:58] Many times a question
[14:01] certain circumstances
[14:05] on things I could not
[14:09] understand.
[14:11] [Music]
[14:15] For many times in trial,
[14:19] my weakness blurs my vision
[14:23] and my frustration
[14:26] is so I'm
[14:29] [Music]
[14:35] reminding
[14:37] I've never been forsening.
[14:42] I've never had to stand the test alone.
[14:51] Oh, it's in those times of victory.
[14:56] My spirit risees up in me. It's through
[15:01] the fire. My weakness is made strong.
[15:08] [Music]
[15:10] Oh, he never promised.
[15:13] Oh, that the cross would not be heavy
[15:18] and the hill would not be hard to climb.
[15:26] [Music]
[15:28] Oh, he never offered
[15:32] a victory without fighting. But he said
[15:37] he'll always come in time.
[15:45] Won't just remember when you're standing
[15:50] for in the valley of decisions
[15:54] in the adversary
[15:57] says give me
[16:02] just
[16:07] cuz I want to show up
[16:11] and he will take
[16:13] [Music]
[16:20] Amen. Aren't you glad for that this
[16:22] morning? I'll cherish that old rugged
[16:25] cross.
[16:30] He
[16:32] far away
[16:35] stood and no
[16:39] rug cross
[16:41] [Music]
[16:43] the
[16:44] cloud
[16:46] of suffering
[16:50] and shame.
[16:51] [Music]
[16:56] And I love
[16:59] that old cross
[17:03] where the tears
[17:06] rest and death

[17:14] lost soul.

[21:14] [Music]
[21:17] Amen. Let's all just pray and believe
[21:19] together.
[21:20] Our gracious father, as we just come to
[21:22] you, Lord, and what a great time that
[21:25] we're living in, Lord.
[21:28] What a great time, Father, that one day
[21:30] we'll lay down the old cross.
[21:34] And Father, one day we'll lay down these
[21:37] old burdens,
[21:39] Lord. One day we'll lay down the old
[21:41] sickness. And Father, many sickness has
[21:43] been made known today.
[21:46] Lord, many accidents has been made
[21:47] known. But Father, we know when we're in
[21:50] you, there's no such thing as an
[21:51] accident.
[21:53] So Lord, we're just praying, Father,
[21:54] that you'll just come and and just meet
[21:57] the needs of your children, meet the
[21:59] needs of the sicknesses that's been made
[22:01] known, Lord, as our pastor is coming,
[22:04] Father, not feeling well and body, but
[22:07] Father, he's reporting for duty at his
[22:10] post to duty, Lord, this morning to feed
[22:12] his children, Lord, feed your children.
[22:15] And we just pray, Father, a special
[22:17] blessings, Lord, upon him, upon the
[22:19] church this morning.
[22:22] And father, as we see the signs, the
[22:24] handwriting on the wall, we see, Lord,
[22:25] that how many days we got, we don't
[22:28] know. But we will make every moment
[22:31] count for you, Lord. There's still
[22:33] someone out there that we can reach.
[22:35] There's still someone because the bride
[22:36] ain't gone.
[22:38] And I believe
[22:40] that one day soon that last one's coming
[22:43] in. We just pray, Father, this morning
[22:45] that you'll have your way in service,
[22:48] have your way in each and every heart.
[22:51] be with brother Andrew Lord this day as
[22:53] he's in up there in California.
[22:57] Bless him we pray. Keep him safe. Keep
[22:59] his travel safe. Bless the meetings
[23:02] there. And father we commit this day in
[23:05] your hands.
[23:06] We just want to tell you father how much
[23:08] we love and appreciate you. In the name
[23:10] of Jesus Christ we ask it all. Amen.
[23:18] This time we'll receive this morning's
[23:20] offering and give as God's bless you.
[23:22] Glad to have brother Marcus with us. We
[23:24] want you to remember him and his his
[23:26] foot injury he's got going on. We'll
[23:28] have him come sing for us this morning
[23:30] as well as sister Lauren Vest if she
[23:32] would come after brother Marcus and then
[23:35] sisterh Emma and Sister Sarah Robinson
[23:37] would come. Amen. God bless you as you
[23:40] give. You can be seated after you've
[23:41] given this morning.
[23:55] I guess while we're giving I could say
[23:58] something briefly on my heart.
[24:01] Last night's sermon was just I think for
[24:03] all of us. Amen. Brother,
[24:06] brother Matt asked me about singing this
[24:08] morning and I my mind went a certain
[24:10] way. But then
[24:13] as I thought about how great, how big
[24:15] God is, I am came to me, the song I am.
[24:19] My last time I sang here, but what more
[24:22] fitting? I sat back there and I thought
[24:24] of all the different things in my life
[24:26] and all of us that we prayed about
[24:29] throughout our lives. And sometimes we
[24:31] pray out of fretting, fear.
[24:35] Fact of the matter is
[24:38] it's nothing. He's going to move. He's
[24:41] going to move. It may not be the way we
[24:43] want, but he's going to move. Maybe it's
[24:45] not on this side of eternity quite like,
[24:47] but he understands. And uh had someone
[24:51] very close to me ask for a request
[24:53] yesterday to pray. And this did to have
[24:56] brother Ron pray. And I felt to tell
[24:58] him,
[25:00] you know, you're you're asking in fear.
[25:04] Ask believing. Our prophet taught us
[25:06] that
[25:08] this song is very special to me. Brother
[25:11] Reagan sent it to me several weeks ago,
[25:13] several short months ago. And I
[25:16] hesitated at first because I thought I
[25:18] don't suppose he sent it to me to sing,
[25:19] but um it it it just it meant so much to
[25:24] me. And he sent me a message back. I
[25:26] knew it would.
[25:27] It's mine now. So, we're going to try
[25:30] it.
[25:34] [Music]
[25:36] When it was dark in my heart, you
[25:40] brought life to me.
[25:43] Child of darkness
[25:46] became a child of life.
[25:51] Oh, when my soul
[25:54] was so dry
[25:55] [Music]
[25:57] and I needed a drink,
[26:01] the waters
[26:03] of life
[26:05] you became to me
[26:09] and I am,
[26:15] you said to me,
[26:18] I am alpha.
[26:20] I'm Omega,
[26:23] the in between.
[26:27] Oh, I am.
[26:33] You said to me,
[26:37] and I'll be what it takes
[26:41] to meet your need.
[26:49] True to you, Jesus.
[26:57] You are the widow's
[26:59] cruise of oil
[27:03] and old Elijah's meat.
[27:07] The shelter for brother Noah,
[27:12] the shepherd for the sheep.
[27:15] been in the fire.
[27:17] You were the fourth man
[27:21] and a cloud by day.
[27:25] Fire by night for your children
[27:29] just to lead the way.
[27:33] Oh, I am.
[27:40] You said to me,
[27:43] I am alpha. I am omega.
[27:47] The in between.
[27:52] I am.
[27:58] You said to me,
[28:02] and I'll be what it takes
[28:05] to meet your need.
[28:10] All I am.
[28:13] [Music]
[28:16] You said to me,
[28:21] I am the bread of life.
[28:24] Just take and eat.
[28:28] Oh, I am.
[28:33] Lord, you said to me,
[28:39] and I'll be what it takes
[28:42] to meet your needs.
[28:47] You are the widow's
[28:50] cruise of oil.
[28:53] You are Elijah's meat.
[28:56] You were the shelter
[28:59] for brother Noah,
[29:02] a shepherd for the sheep
[29:06] and in the fire.
[29:08] You were that fourth man
[29:11] and a cloud by day.
[29:15] You're a fire by night for your
[29:18] children.
[29:20] Watch us lead the way.
[29:23] Lord,
[29:24] I am
[29:26] [Music]
[29:28] Lord.
[29:30] You said to me,
[29:35] I am the bread of life.
[29:38] Just take and eat.
[29:42] All I am.
[29:46] [Music]
[29:49] You said to me
[29:53] and I'll be what it takes
[29:57] to meet your need.
[30:01] And I'll even go by way
[30:07] of Calary.
[30:12] Thank you, Lord.
[30:18] [Applause]
[31:08] [Music]
[31:23] If this world could only see
[31:29] what's taking place in you and me.
[31:36] There's been an invisible
[31:40] union. The word
[31:43] lives in reality.
[31:47] [Music]
[31:50] But the church is all laughed with
[31:53] scorn.
[31:57] While my soul cries, I want more.
[32:03] Whisper your secrets to me, Lord.
[32:09] I be thee.
[32:15] As for me,
[32:20] I believe
[32:26] we're God's eternal
[32:29] thoughts expressed.
[32:32] We're his genes.
[32:37] life of his life.
[32:44] His blood brought victory.
[32:50] I was made for this word. This word fits
[32:54] me.
[32:56] I believe.
[33:00] [Music]
[33:15] The secrets never known to man.
[33:21] By faith we simply
[33:24] understand.
[33:27] Jehovah
[33:29] eagle soared over and screamed.
[33:34] Those mysteries called our name.
[33:40] Now on Christ's body word we feed.
[33:47] We've heard from Arthy of
[33:53] Before the world prepared for me.
[33:59] I believe
[34:02] [Music]
[34:04] as for me
[34:10] I believe
[34:15] we're God's eternal thoughts expressed
[34:21] we're his genes
[34:26] life of His life,
[34:33] his blood brought victory.
[34:38] I was made for this word. This word fits
[34:43] me.
[34:45] I believe
[34:49] I was made for this word. This word fits
[34:54] me.
[34:56] I believe.
[34:58] [Music]
[35:06] [Applause]
[35:48] [Music]
[36:01] Moment when the lights went out.
[36:09] When death had claimed its victory,
[36:18] the king of love had gi up his life.
[36:26] The darkest day in history.
[36:30] [Music]
[36:35] They're on a cross. They made for
[36:39] sinners.
[36:44] For every curse, his blood atone.
[36:52] One final breath and near.
[37:01] But not the end we could have known.
[37:08] For the earth began to shake
[37:15] and the veil was torn.
[37:21] What sacrifice
[37:24] was made
[37:27] as the heavens
[37:30] roar.
[37:32] [Music]
[37:36] All hell king Jesus.
[37:44] All hell the Lord
[37:48] of heaven
[37:50] and earth.
[37:52] All hell king Jesus.
[37:57] [Music]
[38:01] All hell was the savior
[38:05] of
[38:07] the world.
[38:10] [Music]
[38:13] There was a moment when the sky lit up.
[38:21] A flash of light breaking through.

[42:17] Amen. Let's stand. Oh, hell king Jesus.
[42:21] Worthy is the lamb. Isn't he saved by
[42:24] grace? I was saved by grace.
[42:28] Oh, I was alone in the darkness.
[42:33] I could not find my way.
[42:37] Oh, Jesus shine his light on me. And
[42:41] then he turned on my night today.
[42:45] Oh, I was alone in the darkness.
[42:49] I could not find my way.
[42:54] Jesus shine his light on me and then
[42:58] eternal my night today.
[43:02] Save
[43:04] by grace.
[43:06] Oh, I've been saved by grace.

[43:47] Oh, how he brought me from. Oh, sing it
[43:50] one more time. When I reach that city,
[43:55] oh those gates ring open wide,
[43:59] I'm going to sing redemption story.
[44:04] Oh, how he brought me from the other
[44:06] side.
[44:08] Save
[44:10] my grave.
[44:12] Oh, I've been saved by the grace. Well,
[44:16] my name is in the book of life. Oh, I
[44:21] see.
[44:30] I've been saved by grace.
[44:33] It's not what I deserve, but I'm saved
[44:38] my grace.
[44:42] Aren't you thankful for that today?
[44:47] Hallelujah.
[44:49] Hallelujah.
[44:55] Boy, if we got a what we deserve, we'd
[44:58] all be in a mess of trouble, wouldn't
[44:59] we? Amen. Thank God. Won't you greet
[45:02] your neighbor right there where you're
[45:03] at? Good to be in the house of the Lord.
[45:09] With you. We're going to spend eternity
[45:12] together.
[45:14] Amen. Amen.
[45:17] Hallelujah. Don't you love the Lord?
[45:19] Amen. Isn't he good to us? So good to
[45:22] see each and every one of you. And
[45:26] I'm just glad to be here.
[45:29] Amen. Amen. What a wonderful service
[45:31] already. And so we thank you for that.
[45:34] Amen. Isn't he wonderful? Amen. Amen.
[45:38] Amen.
[45:51] Amen. For those that wasn't here last
[45:53] night, we have brother Jeff with us. And
[45:56] uh that's brother Jerry and brother
[45:59] Davey's father and sister Tammy's
[46:02] husband. It's been many years since he's
[46:04] been here. And he's back.
[46:07] And he's back. And so he's he's to be at
[46:10] UVA tomorrow. Then they're supposed to
[46:12] tell him several things. So we want to
[46:14] pray with him. after this service, after
[46:16] this speaking today. And Amen. And we're
[46:19] going to all bind our faith together.
[46:21] And Amen. Cancer's not too much for our
[46:24] God. And so, Amen. So, we're just
[46:27] thankful that last week we went on a
[46:30] mission and he's here today. Here last
[46:33] night and here today. And so, we're glad
[46:35] of that. Amen. You enjoy last night?
[46:39] Amen. So, part two is today. So, here we
[46:41] are. If you will turn with me in your
[46:43] scriptures to Matthew chapter 16 and
[46:46] verse 13.
[46:55] How big is your God?
[46:58] My God's a great big God.
[47:02] Amen. Matthew 16 and verse 13. And when
[47:06] Jesus came to the coast of Cesaria
[47:08] Philippi,
[47:10] he asked his disciples, saying,
[47:13] "Whom do men say that I, the son of man,
[47:16] am?"
[47:18] And they said, "Some say that thou art
[47:20] John the Baptist, and some Elias, and
[47:23] others Jeremiah, or one of the
[47:25] prophets." And he saith unto them, "But
[47:29] whom say ye that I am?" It's important
[47:32] who you say. That's right.
[47:34] And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou
[47:37] art the Christ, the Son of the living
[47:40] God." And Jesus answered and said unto
[47:43] him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah,
[47:46] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[47:48] unto thee, but my father which is in
[47:50] heaven. And I say unto thee that thou
[47:53] art Peter changed his name in a moment.
[47:56] and upon this rock I will build my
[47:58] church and the gates of hell shall not
[48:02] prevail against it.
[48:06] I think it's so powerful. Let's read
[48:08] that verse together. And I say also unto
[48:11] thee that thou art Peter, and upon this
[48:15] rock I will build my church, and the
[48:18] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[48:21] it. Notice these next words. and I will
[48:24] give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
[48:26] of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt
[48:30] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.
[48:33] And whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[48:35] shall be loosed in heaven. You may be
[48:39] seated. May the Lord bless the reading
[48:40] of his word.
[48:46] The most important revelation in the
[48:48] scriptures is to know who Jesus is.
[48:50] Amen.
[48:52] For us as message believers, he's God.
[48:57] And when he explained that to to the
[49:00] church world in that day, it got him
[49:02] crucified.
[49:04] Maybe when you tell
[49:07] your denominational friends that you are
[49:09] the bride of Jesus Christ, that you are
[49:12] Miss Jesus Christ, probably get you
[49:14] crucified too.
[49:17] The theme of this message, the absolute
[49:20] theme of this message is Hebrews 13:8.
[49:24] Jesus Christ the same
[49:27] yesterday and today and forever. What
[49:31] does that mean? He is as powerful today.
[49:38] He is as powerful today as when he said,
[49:42] "Let there be." That's right.
[49:45] and he believed his own word and the sun
[49:47] came into existence.
[49:50] I want you to understand the God that we
[49:53] serve today has never lost one ounce of
[49:57] power.
[49:59] I'll take just a second to explain it.
[50:01] When he heals the worst cancer patient
[50:04] in the world,
[50:06] it does not diminish his healing power
[50:09] one iota.
[50:12] When he saves the worst murderer, the
[50:14] worst sinner, the worst idolattor, the
[50:16] worst prostitute in the world, it does
[50:18] not diminish the power of the blood of
[50:21] Jesus Christ one iota.
[50:26] Our God doesn't get tired. He doesn't
[50:29] get weary.
[50:33] He says in Isaiah 44 and verse 6, I am
[50:38] the first
[50:40] and I am the last.
[50:43] And beside me there is no God. Amen.
[50:48] Revelation 1 and verse 8. I am Alpha and
[50:52] Omega, the beginning and the ending,
[50:55] saith the Lord, which is and which was
[50:57] and which is to come. the Almighty.
[51:06] We'll take time to shout after a little
[51:08] bit.
[51:09] Brother Brandham says, "In he that is in
[51:12] you." And this is an important sermon.
[51:13] If you haven't listened to it for a
[51:14] while, go back and listen to it. 1963
[51:17] 11:10,
[51:19] Brother Bram says, "Greater is he.
[51:23] It's God the creator. The winds and the
[51:26] waves had to obey him. Demons were
[51:30] paralyzed.
[51:32] All nature obeyed him because he was the
[51:36] creator of nature. Oh, when we think
[51:39] about that, it takes the bite out. Then
[51:43] we understand these things that you see.
[51:46] What is it? It isn't man. Man cannot do
[51:50] that. Right?
[51:53] Man is part of the creation, but it's
[51:55] the winds and the waves that obeys the
[52:00] creature, the creator,
[52:03] and takes the creator to do it. For he
[52:06] that is in you.
[52:12] Don't never take that for granted.
[52:15] And he that is in you is greater than he
[52:19] that is in the world.
[52:21] He can cause turmoil. He that can cause
[52:24] turmoil, that's he that's in the world.
[52:28] He that's in you is the creator who made
[52:32] the winds. He can rebuke the devil out
[52:34] of the winds and there is calm. He can
[52:37] rebuke the devil out of the storm and
[52:40] there is becomes no storm.
[52:42] He is the creator
[52:46] and greater is he that is in you.
[52:52] Thank you, Lord. Listen, you're not some
[52:54] mambby pamby somewhere or another.
[52:57] You're sons and daughters of God.
[53:07] Quit your whining.
[53:09] Quit your frustration.
[53:11] Quit your stuff.
[53:14] Recognize who you are
[53:18] and stand on the word of God. I am a son
[53:22] of God. I am a daughter of God. Satan,
[53:27] leave in the name of Jesus Christ.
[53:32] How big is your God?
[53:42] The same God is with us tonight.
[53:46] Not only with us, but in us.
[53:49] He's proved that he's in us. Greater is
[53:52] he that is in you than he that's in the
[53:55] world. What are we afraid of?
[54:02] Won't you just look over at your
[54:03] neighbor and say, "What are we afraid
[54:05] of?
[54:12] Now do it with attitude because that
[54:14] makes a difference.
[54:23] I want you to understand this. Never a
[54:27] man spake like this man.
[54:30] Never. This is scripture. Never a man
[54:34] spake like this man.
[54:37] He turned water into wine. You're
[54:40] talking about impossibilities. That'll
[54:41] do it for you.
[54:44] He defeated Satan by the word of God.
[54:50] He didn't do it with his power. He did
[54:53] it with the word
[54:55] because you was going to need that as an
[54:57] example. You can't defeat Satan with
[55:00] your feelings,
[55:04] with who you are. You must defeat Satan
[55:08] with the word of God. And when you
[55:11] recognize that, you become armed
[55:15] and extremely dangerous.
[55:21] Now remember this. I came from God.
[55:27] I'm going back to God.
[55:29] That's my origin and that's my ending.
[55:35] Listen, we could stop and shout right
[55:37] now for a qu little little while if you
[55:38] could recognize that.
[55:41] Jesus said, "Eat my flesh and drink my
[55:46] blood."
[55:48] He came to the house of prayer where all
[55:50] of the Pharisees had turned the temple
[55:54] into nothing but tradition and selling.
[55:59] And Jesus made a court. Amen. If you was
[56:03] a disciple right now, you're either
[56:05] going to be embarrassed or you're
[56:06] running.
[56:10] He begins to walk in and begins to do
[56:13] what he does. And now somebody asks you,
[56:15] "Are you with him?" Yep. That's a
[56:18] Messiah.
[56:22] Yep. That's a Messiah. And he begins to
[56:25] scream, "You have made the house of
[56:28] prayer a den of thieves.
[56:35] Let's just look at some things. Matthew
[56:38] chapter 28 and verse 19. Go ye therefore
[56:41] and teach all nations, baptizing them in
[56:44] the name of the Father and of the Son
[56:46] and of the Holy Ghost,
[56:49] their titles.
[56:51] Isaiah 9 and6, for unto us a child is
[56:55] born. unto us a son is given, and the
[56:57] government shall be upon his shoulder,
[57:00] and his name shall be called wonderful,
[57:05] counselor,
[57:06] the mighty God. All of those are not
[57:09] names. They're titles.
[57:12] The everlasting father,
[57:15] the prince of peace.
[57:18] No, none of these titles is his name,
[57:21] but his name shall be called,
[57:25] all of this encapsulated in the name of
[57:28] Jesus.
[57:32] All of these titles are in his name. How
[57:35] big is our God?
[57:38] He's the wonderful.
[57:40] He's the counselor. He's the mighty God.
[57:44] He's the everlasting father. Amen.
[57:48] When you say Jesus, he is wonderful.
[57:51] When you say Jesus, he is our counselor.
[57:54] When you say the Jesus, he is the mighty
[57:57] God. When you say everlasting father,
[58:01] Jesus is the everlasting father.
[58:06] He is the prince of peace.
[58:13] Matthew,
[58:14] go ye therefore and teach all nations,
[58:16] baptizing them in the name of the
[58:18] Father. Father is not a name no more
[58:21] than wonderful counselor, prince of
[58:22] peace, mighty God, or the everlasting
[58:24] father. There is no salvation in any
[58:28] name, Father, Son, Holy Ghost. You must
[58:31] know who the Holy Ghost is.
[58:38] Are you with me? That's why Peter stood
[58:40] up that day and said, "Repent,
[58:43] every one of you and be baptized
[58:47] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[58:51] the remission of your sins." How big is
[58:54] your God?
[58:56] He can take every one of our sins and
[58:59] wipe them away.
[59:06] Now, how important is this in Israel
[59:10] tonight? There's wars going on
[59:14] cuz we're coming to the end of time.
[59:16] We're at the season of the rapture for
[59:18] the gentile bride to go home.
[59:21] And we're also at the season of two
[59:24] prophets to step on the scene. Moses and
[59:27] Elijah. The denomination world believes
[59:30] it's uh Elijah and Enoch.
[59:34] That's what they believe. But your
[59:37] prophet
[59:39] under the seven seals says it's Moses
[59:43] and Elijah because their characteristics
[59:46] fit who they are. and they will return
[59:49] and preach to a 144,000
[59:53] of elected Jews that will believe the
[59:57] message of the hour.
[59:59] What will the theme of that message be?
[1:00:02] Who is Jesus?
[1:00:08] What was the theme of this message? Who
[1:00:11] is Jesus?
[1:00:15] Now what is you say? Brother Ron, is
[1:00:17] that important? Yes. When you see who is
[1:00:20] Jesus, you will see who you are.
[1:00:24] That's right.
[1:00:26] Are you with me? Down through the ages,
[1:00:30] there's been men that attempted and
[1:00:32] probed at preaching the seven seals.
[1:00:36] We have no idea who many of these people
[1:00:39] were, their names were because they were
[1:00:42] nobody's attempting to open the book.
[1:00:45] But God sent you, Elijah the prophet to
[1:00:49] turn your hearts back.
[1:00:53] And under that Elijah ministry, the book
[1:00:56] was to come open for us
[1:00:59] because we needed to see the trail of
[1:01:01] the serpent all the way from the
[1:01:03] beginning all the way to the end.
[1:01:06] We needed to know who this mighty God
[1:01:09] was.
[1:01:11] Knowing who this mighty God was begins
[1:01:13] to tell you who you are.
[1:01:18] We must take our position. More than a
[1:01:20] good quote, but we must take our
[1:01:22] position.
[1:01:24] Who was Jesus?
[1:01:26] This will be powerful words from two
[1:01:29] prophets.
[1:01:31] And they will begin to preach. And I'd
[1:01:32] like to just step into it just for a
[1:01:34] second. You crucified the Lord. That's
[1:01:37] right.
[1:01:39] 2,000 years ago, right? According to the
[1:01:42] prophet, he said they will tell them
[1:01:44] that you were blinded. That's right.
[1:01:48] And you could not see who he was because
[1:01:52] he was going to get a gentile bride.
[1:01:55] Like Joseph was the type of Jesus Christ
[1:01:58] that would have a gentile bride. God
[1:02:01] blinded the eyes of those Jews.
[1:02:06] So that you and I gentile dogs, just say
[1:02:09] it how it is. You and I gentile dogs
[1:02:12] could have a chance
[1:02:14] at the word of God.
[1:02:23] You can imagine the moment their eyes
[1:02:25] will come open and begin to realize who
[1:02:29] Jesus is.
[1:02:31] Now, if you're having difficulty of is
[1:02:34] it one or is it two or is it three or is
[1:02:39] it 10
[1:02:43] that didn't come from the scriptures
[1:02:47] that came from Rome
[1:02:51] that came from Rome.
[1:02:54] The worship of Mary came from Rome.
[1:02:58] Counting rosary beads came from Rome.
[1:03:02] Baptizing in the father, son, the holy
[1:03:04] ghost came from Rome.
[1:03:09] No person in the scriptures were
[1:03:11] baptized any other way than in the name
[1:03:14] of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:19] Are you with me, brother Ron? I'm here
[1:03:20] to battle that. Well, you go read the
[1:03:23] first church age chapter.
[1:03:28] and your eyes will come open.
[1:03:33] Are you with me now?
[1:03:36] I'll just give you an example.
[1:03:39] Brother Kelly's daughter
[1:03:42] had been had been had married into a
[1:03:45] situation to where that she had been
[1:03:47] taken away into a church that believed
[1:03:50] in two Lords
[1:03:52] and her eyes was blinded to it. She she
[1:03:54] became under the influence of that. When
[1:03:57] she first got around me, I asked her, I
[1:03:59] said, "Have you read the church age
[1:04:02] book?"
[1:04:03] Well, of course, that book was taboo
[1:04:06] under that ministry. That's right. Amen.
[1:04:10] It was taboo. Don't read it because when
[1:04:12] you read the church age book, it tells
[1:04:15] you who Jesus Christ is. And you don't
[1:04:18] have to go but a few pages.
[1:04:22] So, I asked two young men, her sons. I
[1:04:26] said, uh, those boys were just
[1:04:28] incredible boys, and you've met them
[1:04:29] before. And I asked them, I was sitting
[1:04:31] outside in Pigeon Forge, and we were
[1:04:33] sitting on two big old rocking chairs,
[1:04:35] and they were sitting there, and I and I
[1:04:37] called them by name. I said, "Have you
[1:04:38] read the church age book?" And they
[1:04:41] said, "We're not allowed to." I said,
[1:04:42] "Who told you that?"
[1:04:47] Some preacher tell you that. Well, he's
[1:04:49] a liar.
[1:04:52] This is for the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:05:04] Well, those boys went and read that
[1:05:05] church age book. They read about the
[1:05:07] first chapter
[1:05:09] and boom,
[1:05:13] boom, their eyes come open. So, if
[1:05:16] you're sitting here today or if you're
[1:05:17] on the internet and you're having
[1:05:18] trouble with three gods, two gods, one
[1:05:20] God, go read,
[1:05:23] you don't have the book, go look it up
[1:05:25] on the internet, the church age book,
[1:05:28] and read the first chapter, right?
[1:05:33] Don't get blinded with vision of of some
[1:05:36] denomination.
[1:05:38] You might as well go to the author of
[1:05:40] the book.
[1:05:44] This is not to be argued with.
[1:05:47] Jesus was God.
[1:05:51] That's right.
[1:05:53] Brother Bram said, "If he wasn't God,
[1:05:56] then he's the greatest deceiver that the
[1:05:58] world's ever had." Amen.
[1:06:01] Listen, if he wasn't God, those
[1:06:03] disciples that went and got crucified
[1:06:05] upside down,
[1:06:08] drugged through the s street, beheaded,
[1:06:11] they believed who he was.
[1:06:16] 1949, brother Brandham says some
[1:06:19] statements 49 early in his ministry, the
[1:06:24] deity of him.
[1:06:26] Who is he? Some of them makes him a
[1:06:29] little baby back yonder. Who is the one
[1:06:32] that stood there on that invisible? Oh
[1:06:35] my. That platformer and raped out of his
[1:06:38] hands and spoke, "Let there be."
[1:06:41] And there was light. That was Jesus
[1:06:44] Christ. For he was in the world and the
[1:06:47] world was made by him and the world
[1:06:48] recognized him not. He is the deity of
[1:06:52] God. Look what he did back there. Talk
[1:06:55] about miraculous back there. You talk
[1:06:57] about shouting when he performed
[1:06:59] miraculous things to make things which
[1:07:02] are now out of the things which were
[1:07:04] not. He spoke the word and it was so.
[1:07:08] Amen.
[1:07:12] Kind of like those scientists that were
[1:07:14] arguing with God. You know this is
[1:07:16] story. They were arguing with God. Well,
[1:07:20] we can we can make a earth. He said okay
[1:07:24] go ahead. And they picked up some dirt
[1:07:26] and they said, "Get
[1:07:28] your own dirt."
[1:07:37] And that same power that was in Christ,
[1:07:40] let the fundamentalists, let them people
[1:07:43] who deny the power of God and say it's
[1:07:45] wrong, but that same power that spoke
[1:07:47] the world into existence is in those
[1:07:50] people that's got the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:52] The same power that spoken the world
[1:07:54] into existence is the same power that
[1:07:57] lives in you. That ought to make your
[1:08:00] Monday better.
[1:08:04] Men and women, it's time that we found
[1:08:06] out who you are. The devil is trying to
[1:08:10] hide you back and tell you that you're
[1:08:12] some little trotten down something.
[1:08:14] You're not. You're sons and daughters of
[1:08:18] God. The deity is not in heaven. It's in
[1:08:22] you.
[1:08:32] I know you think I'm crazy, but let me
[1:08:34] just tell you something, brother. When
[1:08:36] you realize that almighty God lives in
[1:08:39] you, immortal life,
[1:08:44] my life I give you, Zoe, the life of God
[1:08:48] is in the human being.
[1:08:52] How important is that when you realize
[1:08:54] that you can't lose?
[1:09:04] Let that sink in just a minute
[1:09:07] and I'll catch my breath.
[1:09:14] He is the first and the last.
[1:09:17] He is the beginning and the end.
[1:09:20] He is the keeper of the creation and the
[1:09:22] creator of it all.
[1:09:24] He is the architect of the universe and
[1:09:26] and the manager of all times.
[1:09:29] He always was.
[1:09:33] He always is and he always will be.
[1:09:39] He is the unmoved, unchanged, undefeated
[1:09:43] and never undone.
[1:09:45] He was bruised and brought healing. He
[1:09:48] was pierced and erased our pain. He was
[1:09:51] persecuted and brought freedom. He was
[1:09:53] dead and he brought life.
[1:09:58] He is the risen and brings power. He
[1:10:01] reigns and he brings peace. The world
[1:10:03] can't understand him. Armies can't
[1:10:06] defeat him. Schools can't explain him.
[1:10:09] Leaders can't ignore him.
[1:10:12] Herod couldn't kill him.
[1:10:18] You ought to be saying, "Boo devil,
[1:10:20] boovil, boovil."
[1:10:23] The Pharisees couldn't confuse him.
[1:10:26] The people couldn't hold him. Nero
[1:10:29] couldn't crush him. Hilar can't silence
[1:10:33] him.
[1:10:36] He is goodness. He is kindness. He is
[1:10:40] generous.
[1:10:43] He is God. Amen.
[1:10:46] He is holy. He is righteous. He is
[1:10:49] mighty. He is powerful. He is pure. His
[1:10:53] ways is always right.
[1:10:57] The word is eternal. He is that
[1:11:00] unchanging. And his mind is always on
[1:11:03] me. Amen. He is my savior. He is my God.
[1:11:07] He is my peace. He is my joy. He is my
[1:11:11] comfort. He's my Lord. He rules my life.
[1:11:15] I serve him because he loves me.
[1:11:20] His burden is light. His goal is for me
[1:11:23] of abundant life. I follow him because
[1:11:25] he is the wisdom of the wise,
[1:11:29] the power of the powerful. He is the
[1:11:32] ancient of days, the ruler of rulers,
[1:11:35] the leader of leaders,
[1:11:38] the overseer of overcomers.
[1:11:42] And if he seems impressive to you, if
[1:11:44] that seems impressive to you, try this
[1:11:47] one on for size. His goal is to have a
[1:11:50] relationship with me.
[1:11:52] [Music]
[1:11:56] And he will never leave me.
[1:12:01] Hallelujah. He will never forsake me.
[1:12:05] He will never mislead me. He will never
[1:12:10] forget me. Amen. There's a sermon in
[1:12:12] every one of these spots. He will never
[1:12:15] overlook me. He will never counsel my
[1:12:19] appointment in his appointment book.
[1:12:22] When I fall, he lifts me up.
[1:12:25] When I fail, he forgives me. When I am
[1:12:28] weak, he is strong. When I am lost, he's
[1:12:31] my way. When I'm afraid, he is my
[1:12:33] courage. When I stumble, he steadies me.
[1:12:36] When I am hurt, he heals me. When I am
[1:12:38] broken, he mends me. When I'm blind, he
[1:12:41] leads me.
[1:12:43] When I am hungry, he feeds me. When I
[1:12:46] face trials, he's with me. When I face
[1:12:49] persecutions, he comfort me.
[1:12:54] He is my shield and he is my buckler.
[1:12:58] When I face loss, he provides for me.
[1:13:01] When I face death, he carries me home.
[1:13:05] He is God.
[1:13:10] He is faithful.
[1:13:12] I am his and he is mine.
[1:13:17] God is in control.
[1:13:21] I'm on his side.
[1:13:31] Jesus said some things I want to remind
[1:13:33] you of.
[1:13:35] I am the way.
[1:13:41] I'm not one of the ways.
[1:13:46] This is not just some social gospel.
[1:13:50] I am the way.
[1:13:55] The truth
[1:13:57] and the life.
[1:13:59] What about my church? Don't have nothing
[1:14:02] to do with it.
[1:14:05] It don't have nothing to do with it. You
[1:14:07] could sit in church every day of your
[1:14:08] life and die and go straight to hell.
[1:14:11] You can sign every book in this county
[1:14:13] and don't mean nothing whatsoever if you
[1:14:15] don't have Jesus.
[1:14:18] If you don't have Jesus,
[1:14:26] and I'm talking about Jesus is not some
[1:14:28] historical book or somebody else's
[1:14:32] story. I'm talking about a personal
[1:14:34] revelation of who Jesus Christ is to
[1:14:37] you.
[1:14:40] Hallelujah. If you met him in the car or
[1:14:44] you met him during a service or you met
[1:14:46] him and he came and he changed your
[1:14:49] life,
[1:14:50] it don't take him 10 years. It takes him
[1:14:53] a moment.
[1:14:57] Jesus is mine.
[1:15:08] He said, "Peace be still."
[1:15:12] And the storm ceased.
[1:15:20] He said, "Lazarus,
[1:15:23] come forth."
[1:15:28] Now, brother Brandham gave some clarity
[1:15:30] to that
[1:15:32] and David, brother Brandham said, if
[1:15:34] Jesus had not called him by name,
[1:15:39] there would have been a general
[1:15:42] resurrection.
[1:15:47] Now, you tell you talk about a
[1:15:48] supernatural time that we are coming up
[1:15:51] on.
[1:15:53] That's right. Every one of us have loved
[1:15:55] ones in the grave
[1:15:59] beyond this veil of tears standing
[1:16:02] somewhere in a well body.
[1:16:05] They are longing to come back and see
[1:16:07] you.
[1:16:10] You're talking about being homesick.
[1:16:12] They're looking to come see you.
[1:16:16] And there's going to come a resurrection
[1:16:18] and they're going to step this
[1:16:20] dimension.
[1:16:25] Come on, church. You talking about a
[1:16:28] supernatural time.
[1:16:33] Brother Ron, I I just don't believe too
[1:16:34] much in the supernatural. You're missing
[1:16:36] the point.
[1:16:38] You're missing the whole point of this
[1:16:40] message. We've got to have a rapture.
[1:16:46] It's our promise. Abraham's promise was
[1:16:50] to have a son.
[1:16:56] Brother Ron, Brother Brown's been gone
[1:16:57] over 60 years. Don't matter.
[1:17:00] It don't matter. None. We had to wait on
[1:17:03] some of you.
[1:17:06] How many TJs, teenagers do we have in
[1:17:08] this building? Go ahead and stand.
[1:17:21] We had to wait till you got here
[1:17:25] cuz God said, "I'll not lose a one. Your
[1:17:29] names are written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:17:31] Life."
[1:17:34] William, no doubt as a young man
[1:17:36] believing the message, you thought it's
[1:17:38] going to happen any time. But these guys
[1:17:39] had to come. They had to come from your
[1:17:42] Lawrence. God not only had Jew on his
[1:17:45] mind, but he had him on his mind. How
[1:17:48] big is our God? Thank you. You can be
[1:17:50] seated.
[1:18:02] When he walked into a room and there was
[1:18:03] a lot of doubters there,
[1:18:06] he said, "Damsel, arise."
[1:18:10] It wasn't a doubt in his mind what was
[1:18:12] getting ready to take place.
[1:18:15] Jesus would say these words, "I have
[1:18:18] power to lay my life down and power to
[1:18:22] take it up again."
[1:18:24] That's more than poetry. That's right.
[1:18:27] Nobody else ever said it. And then did
[1:18:30] it.
[1:18:32] [Applause]
[1:18:34] Come on, church. There's a lot of people
[1:18:36] say a lot of things, but I'm talking
[1:18:39] about make it live.
[1:18:42] [Applause]
[1:18:50] Said it earlier, water into wine.
[1:18:55] First miracle.
[1:18:57] Wine
[1:18:59] is taken from the from the vines.
[1:19:04] Crushed.
[1:19:06] Crushed.
[1:19:08] Fermented.
[1:19:10] Aged.
[1:19:12] This was no little bitty miracle.
[1:19:17] And as a matter of fact, the visitors
[1:19:20] was there said, "You save the best till
[1:19:24] the last."
[1:19:26] Well, let me just tell you, God don't do
[1:19:28] things halfway.
[1:19:35] When he turned Sarah back, young, most
[1:19:38] beautiful woman in the land. Woo! Baby,
[1:19:43] [Applause]
[1:19:48] just wait till you see my brand new
[1:19:51] home. Amen. Wait, do you see my mansion
[1:19:55] there?
[1:19:58] Maybe one of these days you'll be
[1:19:59] walking down the streets of glory and
[1:20:01] look over at a little blondheaded woman
[1:20:02] and a red-headed guy.
[1:20:06] This week we have an anniversary 42
[1:20:09] years.
[1:20:20] other than Jesus Christ is the best
[1:20:22] decision that I ever made. And I'm going
[1:20:24] to ask her to stand and testify right
[1:20:26] now,
[1:20:28] but it's the best decision that I ever
[1:20:30] made. There would be no need for a
[1:20:33] marriage counsel if everybody's marriage
[1:20:34] like was like mine.
[1:20:38] Wouldn't be no need for a divorce lawyer
[1:20:40] if everybody's marriage is like mine.
[1:20:42] But I'm going to tell you the secret. is
[1:20:45] Jesus.
[1:20:47] That's the secret.
[1:20:56] Brother Ron, give me some pointers. Tell
[1:20:58] her how beautiful she is.
[1:21:02] Every day,
[1:21:06] Brother Ron, but you know, I've never
[1:21:08] did it before. Start today. That's
[1:21:10] right,
[1:21:11] you can't do nothing about the last 20
[1:21:13] years. Start today.
[1:21:17] She'll lock it.
[1:21:34] Can you imagine some of these Hollywood
[1:21:37] doll babies
[1:21:39] what they look like 40 years later?
[1:21:58] But they make them look on the movie
[1:22:00] screen like they're immortal.
[1:22:10] But when you got a wife of character,
[1:22:14] she's beautiful and courageous.
[1:22:25] Yeah, baby.
[1:22:31] She's beautiful in a night gown that's
[1:22:33] that thick.
[1:22:36] Some of you been married a while. You
[1:22:37] know what I'm talking about right there.
[1:22:51] You ain't right, dude. You ain't right.
[1:22:54] She's sitting right over there. She can
[1:22:56] hear you, bro.
[1:23:06] But can you imagine going to a land
[1:23:10] where we look better
[1:23:12] than we've ever looked here?
[1:23:16] Why wouldn't you want to go?
[1:23:20] Come on, church. Why wouldn't you want
[1:23:22] to go?
[1:23:24] But I got friends here. They ain't going
[1:23:26] to be here forever.
[1:23:28] They going to hell, folks.
[1:23:31] [Applause]
[1:23:38] Listen, if you don't know Jesus and you
[1:23:40] ain't born again, going to hell.
[1:23:42] Let's not color it any other way. He
[1:23:45] came to save sinners.
[1:23:48] He came that you wouldn't have to go to
[1:23:50] hell.
[1:23:52] There is a major difference between
[1:23:54] being bride and redeemed. Amen.
[1:23:57] Are you with me? There's a major
[1:23:59] difference, but I still want to go.
[1:24:01] Amen.
[1:24:05] Are you with me?
[1:24:08] He is omnipresent. He's omnisient. He's
[1:24:12] omnipotent. He is infinite. If he isn't,
[1:24:15] he isn't God.
[1:24:18] He is eternal.
[1:24:20] Being omnipresent, omnisient, knowing
[1:24:23] all things makes him omnipresent. He is
[1:24:26] the same. yesterday,
[1:24:28] today, and forever. So, I have a
[1:24:31] question. What about your miracle?
[1:24:37] What about your miracle? What about your
[1:24:41] situation?
[1:24:45] Whether it's financial or it's spiritual
[1:24:48] or it's some dreaded disease,
[1:24:51] God's bigger than your need.
[1:25:09] God doesn't limit himself.
[1:25:11] You limit him.
[1:25:16] You put boundaries on a God that feels
[1:25:18] all time, space, and eternity.
[1:25:21] you with a negative attitude or a
[1:25:24] negative thought
[1:25:27] says, "This is the way I'm going to
[1:25:28] always be." But instead of being that
[1:25:31] way, you ought to say, "I'm healed."
[1:25:34] regardless of how it looks like.
[1:25:37] [Applause]
[1:25:48] Brother Ron, you're standing there
[1:25:49] preaching with cancer. Fourth stage. Let
[1:25:51] me just say this to you. God's bigger.
[1:25:57] God's bigger. Do I look like I have
[1:26:00] fourth stage cancer? Do I preach like
[1:26:02] I've got four stage cancer?
[1:26:07] I believe
[1:26:09] he's my healer. I believe he's my way
[1:26:13] maker. I believe he's bigger than every
[1:26:17] cell of cancer.
[1:26:23] What about your miracle?
[1:26:26] What about your situation?
[1:26:32] I mean it with all my heart. What about
[1:26:34] your need?
[1:26:46] Psalms 150. I'm coming to a close.
[1:26:54] Then what do brother Ando we do? I'm
[1:26:57] going to give you I'm gonna give you
[1:26:59] some help.
[1:27:00] Instead of a negative attitude,
[1:27:04] I'm going to give you some I'm gonna
[1:27:05] give you some help here.
[1:27:08] You see, God designed birds to praise
[1:27:10] him.
[1:27:11] He designed trees to praise him. He
[1:27:14] designed dolphins to praise him. He
[1:27:17] designed crickets to praise him. Amen.
[1:27:20] Every morning at 5:00, Brother TJ, he
[1:27:24] designed two ducks
[1:27:28] to set on my power line
[1:27:32] and scream
[1:27:34] and call to one another.
[1:27:37] You see, doves don't have other
[1:27:39] boyfriends and girlfriends. They're
[1:27:41] married for life,
[1:27:44] and they want to hear each other's call.
[1:27:48] God's not wanting somebody else to do
[1:27:50] your praising for you. He wants to hear
[1:27:53] you.
[1:27:56] You,
[1:27:58] you.
[1:28:00] You.
[1:28:02] You.
[1:28:03] [Applause]
[1:28:16] I was reading an article on anxiety one
[1:28:18] time
[1:28:20] and in this article it said that when
[1:28:23] you have the right soulmate,
[1:28:26] catch this, when you have the right
[1:28:28] soulmate,
[1:28:30] men, when you're under such anxiety and
[1:28:33] under such pressure, you can pick up the
[1:28:36] phone and talk to your right soulmate
[1:28:40] And her giggle,
[1:28:44] her giggle
[1:28:47] will calm your soul.
[1:28:54] I've been on the mission field and I've
[1:28:56] heard a giggle.
[1:29:00] And I was so homesick, I couldn't stand
[1:29:02] it. I was so sick of being where I was,
[1:29:05] I couldn't stand it. I just wanted to go
[1:29:07] home.
[1:29:08] I picked up the phone and she cured it
[1:29:15] with a giggle.
[1:29:20] Now listen, when you marry somebody, you
[1:29:22] don't decide, you know, I'm going to
[1:29:24] marry them and change them.
[1:29:28] You can't change yourself,
[1:29:32] brother. I can change. I can go through
[1:29:34] all of these different classes and
[1:29:35] change myself. Okay, try going by a
[1:29:39] crispy cream donut shop that's got the
[1:29:42] hot sign on.
[1:29:47] It's like a fella said, I prayed, Lord,
[1:29:49] if it's your des your desire for me to
[1:29:52] have a donut, may there be a parking
[1:29:55] spot
[1:29:56] open for me.
[1:29:59] And on the 13th time around the shop, I
[1:30:02] found one.
[1:30:21] Brother Ron, I don't want a preacher
[1:30:22] that makes me laugh. Well, you're
[1:30:23] welcome to leave. We need your seat.
[1:30:38] It'll save me millions of dollars trying
[1:30:41] to build enough to hold everybody here.
[1:30:45] Back to worship.
[1:30:50] Praise ye the Lord. Psalms 150 and verse
[1:30:52] one. Praise God in a sanctuary.
[1:30:56] Praise him in the firmament of his
[1:30:58] power. Praise him for his mighty acts.
