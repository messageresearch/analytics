[53:50] the end of the table and i'm just
[53:52] writing some things down
[53:54] and and she said in every place
[53:58] everything's just got to be right and i
[53:59] thought of how the lord
[54:01] [Music]
[54:06] he's making
[54:07] he's making preparations for a table
[54:10] [Music]
[54:14] anna

[54:21] and everything's just gonna be right
[54:24] it's just gonna be right

[54:31] our friend brother kelly hildebrand has
[54:33] pneumonia
[54:36] and he's trying to preach this morning
[54:37] we pray that god would just touch him
[54:41] brother roger and sister ann are in a
[54:43] very difficult time with their
[54:46] and their family
[54:48] it's all in god's hands god's time in

[54:52] i want to lift him in prayer this
[54:54] morning
[54:55] brother andrew wow what a sermon last
[54:58] night
[54:59] i felt sorry for the guy following him
[55:01] today and so
[55:04] and so
[55:06] i want to pray that god would anoint him
[55:08] and brother and brother timothy next
[55:10] week
[55:11] these meanings are crucial
[55:13] because now we're just right at the end
[55:15] of the end
[55:17] we're at the end of the end of the end
[55:20] the gentile dispensation all that
[55:23] gentiles will go on but god will move
[55:25] from gentiles to jews
[55:28] [Music]
[55:30] and so we want to see those get saved
[55:32] before he makes that move
[55:36] amen
[55:38] so let's pray for all of these things
[55:40] today maybe
[55:41] you'd like to say brother would you
[55:43] remember me
[55:46] father
[55:51] thank you that you're a god that can
[55:53] be touched with the feeling
[55:55] of our infirmities
[55:59] you would take the time to sit at a well
[56:02] and wait on a woman
[56:05] you would go to a house
[56:08] to wear that
[56:13] but you knew that you wouldn't be
[56:15] welcome but because of one woman that
[56:17] would come and wash your feet
[56:20] now lord this house is a house that
[56:22] that you're welcome this building is
[56:24] full of believers
[56:26] that love your message

[56:36] his body today

[56:41] or dry out those nodules
[56:44] drop that pneumonia today
[56:46] bring him straight today
[56:48] ask you to touch his body
[56:50] he has a very rigorous agenda just in
[56:53] front of me i pray that you'd give him
[56:55] strength for that father
[56:58] now lord jesus you see our needs today
[57:00] our hands have went up
[57:03] god
[57:05] you specialize in impossibilities
[57:08] [Music]
[57:09] this week i will sit before some of the
[57:11] best doctors
[57:13] that there is
[57:16] and they will give me what their
[57:17] thoughts are
[57:20] but god you're the high physician
[57:24] today today
[57:27] you're not just a practicing physician
[57:30] but you're a perfecting one
[57:33] you're the one that made our bodies
[57:35] so you know how to heal them
[57:37] now i ask you today that you would
[57:39] anoint my flesh
[57:41] my spirit in my soul
[57:43] like never before
[57:45] and lord may if there's any gift that we
[57:47] have both the speaker and his hearer is
[57:50] to get ourselves out of the way
[57:52] we ask you that the angel of the lord
[57:55] would just take full control of this
[57:57] building now
[57:58] in jesus name we pray
[58:00] amen and amen
[58:02] amen god bless you god bless you
[58:05] so much
[58:08] amen
[58:10] matthew chapter 6 and verse 9
[58:15] and then matthew chapter 5 and verse 2.
[58:28] i'd like to just speak to you today
[58:31] on orchestrated lives
[58:34] for orchestrated place
[58:39] matthew chapter 6 and verse 9.
[58:43] and jesus is just in a few words
[58:46] is going to teach us
[58:48] about prayer
[58:50] and after this manner pray therefore
[58:52] pray ye
[58:54] our father
[58:56] which art in heaven
[58:59] hallowed
[59:00] be thy name
[59:02] we could spend months on that sentence
[59:08] thy kingdom come
[59:11] thy will be done in earth
[59:14] as it is in heaven
[59:16] so may we reflect
[59:18] our citizenship of another world
[59:23] give us this day
[59:25] our daily bread
[59:27] and forgive us of our debts
[59:30] as we forgive our debtors
[59:34] and lead us not into temptation
[59:36] but deliver us from evil
[59:39] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[59:42] and the glory forever amen you can be
[59:46] seated
[59:50] jesus in this prayer was speaking of two
[59:52] worlds
[59:54] citizens of this world and citizens of
[59:57] another world
[59:58] and he was telling us that he would
[1:00:00] provide for us our daily bread
[1:00:04] we don't know what tomorrow's struggle
[1:00:05] is but he does
[1:00:07] so he knows how to give us
[1:00:09] words of eternal life that will give us
[1:00:13] strength for the coming battles
[1:00:17] the debts that he's talking about is not
[1:00:19] necessarily the finances in your mailbox
[1:00:22] but he's talking about sins that you're
[1:00:24] that you have had in your past life
[1:00:27] that you have dealt with
[1:00:29] the difficulty of your mind battles that
[1:00:32] you deal with on a daily basis
[1:00:35] not only are you dealing with them but
[1:00:36] others are dealing with them as well
[1:00:39] then he tells us that lead us not into
[1:00:41] temptation
[1:00:43] and if you remember we have angels that
[1:00:45] are about us that are watching over us
[1:00:47] that we are better protected than the
[1:00:49] president of the united states of
[1:00:51] america
[1:00:52] satan would destroy us all
[1:00:55] if he could
[1:00:56] and he would do it in a moment's notice
[1:01:00] sometimes you're thinking about you're
[1:01:02] having a difficult day and your day is
[1:01:04] being destroyed you would just read the
[1:01:06] paper
[1:01:07] innocent people are killed in malls
[1:01:10] and in parking lots
[1:01:12] on the highway
[1:01:14] and you think well why didn't it happen
[1:01:16] to me let me just say at that moment you
[1:01:18] need to think that god has angels that
[1:01:21] are watching over you
[1:01:25] jesus is going to preach
[1:01:28] no doubt one of his first sermons
[1:01:32] and you would think that the one that
[1:01:34] created the worlds
[1:01:36] let me just say this to you the son that
[1:01:39] comes up in the morning
[1:01:40] our god
[1:01:42] created that
[1:01:47] our god created that the super moon that
[1:01:50] we saw on thursday night
[1:01:52] our god
[1:01:54] created that
[1:01:57] he created a light for our universe
[1:02:01] to which that it would burn so hot
[1:02:06] that it would light the entire universe
[1:02:09] and it would be so bright till the
[1:02:11] furthest star would reflect itself
[1:02:16] because the further star has no
[1:02:18] resonance in itself to have light but it
[1:02:21] reflects the sun
[1:02:24] which is even billions of miles away
[1:02:26] from it god created that sun
[1:02:29] and he created it such that it would
[1:02:32] never go out
[1:02:34] [Music]
[1:02:37] man can't even create a light bulb can
[1:02:39] do that
[1:02:46] when we think about how that god laid
[1:02:48] the zodiac out everyone in its perfect
[1:02:51] order
[1:02:52] had to clinker as the prophet stood in
[1:02:54] the pulpit and began to tell us of
[1:02:57] not darwin's theory
[1:03:00] but begin to tell us about
[1:03:02] how that god created the heavens and the
[1:03:04] earth
[1:03:06] that was more than a kentuckian's idea
[1:03:12] and we'll get to some of that
[1:03:14] when enoch
[1:03:16] writes
[1:03:17] when he looks at the heavens and then he
[1:03:19] builds a pyramid
[1:03:21] he does it absolutely into perfection
[1:03:25] even now that we we don't understand the
[1:03:28] mystery of how all the lines
[1:03:31] that the pyramid mid is perfect
[1:03:36] it is perfect it lays on the the very
[1:03:39] very center of the earth every every
[1:03:42] even every corner is exactly right
[1:03:45] everything is exactly right because god
[1:03:48] was writing his first bible
[1:03:52] 40 different writers
[1:03:54] would write your bible
[1:03:57] every one of them had to lay aside their
[1:03:59] own personality to write the word of god
[1:04:05] are you with me
[1:04:06] every one of them had to get beside
[1:04:08] their own personality so that they could
[1:04:11] show god
[1:04:13] and write it down not for a temporary uh
[1:04:17] generation but it's going to be
[1:04:19] throughout all
[1:04:21] throughout all eternity
[1:04:24] no time period to it
[1:04:26] it's going to be through eternity
[1:04:32] each one
[1:04:33] would be inspired by the same
[1:04:36] same author
[1:04:38] the god of the bible the god that wrote
[1:04:40] that role the son into existence the god
[1:04:43] that put the pyramid
[1:04:45] that god would come to moses
[1:04:53] now that god is going to stand in
[1:04:55] humanity
[1:04:57] you know
[1:04:59] and not necessarily a hollywood by a
[1:05:01] body
[1:05:03] a man maybe a less than 150 pounds a
[1:05:07] slender man
[1:05:08] rugged looking man
[1:05:11] not a body to wear that
[1:05:14] anyone would
[1:05:16] feel extremely well that's a great
[1:05:19] handsome man it's not a statesman sort
[1:05:21] of a man he's a he's actually
[1:05:24] he's actually came in such a veiled body
[1:05:31] until nobody will pay attention to his
[1:05:33] body
[1:05:34] but that was god
[1:05:37] it was god in a manger
[1:05:40] it was god being in egypt for two years
[1:05:43] it was god confounding those those
[1:05:46] wisest men of the earth
[1:05:49] that was god veiled in that humanity
[1:05:52] brother brown said if he wasn't god
[1:05:55] he was the greatest deceiver that the
[1:05:57] world's ever had
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:01] are you with me now
[1:06:04] let me just touch this just for a moment
[1:06:07] the woman that had a blood issue had
[1:06:09] been to every doctor
[1:06:12] but she said if i can only touch the hem
[1:06:14] of his garment
[1:06:16] i know i'll be well
[1:06:18] because that was god
[1:06:21] jesus's friend lazarus was in a tomb
[1:06:25] no other are you with me now
[1:06:27] no other man had been raised in disorder
[1:06:30] nobody had walked to a tomb
[1:06:33] after corruption had set in but he was
[1:06:36] going to prove that i am the
[1:06:38] resurrection and i am the life
[1:06:42] a lot of people say a lot of things but
[1:06:44] they can't back it up
[1:06:45] [Applause]
[1:06:54] notice what he says
[1:06:57] blessed are the poor in spirit
[1:07:00] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:07:04] remember how brother branham before he
[1:07:06] preaches his seals he preaches god hid
[1:07:09] and revealed in simplicity
[1:07:14] blessed are the poor in spirit
[1:07:16] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:07:19] blessed are they that mourn for they
[1:07:21] shall be comforted
[1:07:23] blessed are the meek for they shall
[1:07:25] inherit the earth
[1:07:27] blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:07:29] thirst after righteousness for they
[1:07:31] shall be filled
[1:07:33] blessed are the merciful
[1:07:35] for they shall obtain mercy
[1:07:38] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[1:07:41] shall see god
[1:07:43] now remember he's operating in two
[1:07:45] worlds
[1:07:49] he's standing preaching to thousands
[1:07:53] and he knows there's some seed there
[1:07:58] that's going to spend eternity with him
[1:08:00] brother jim you send us a picture every
[1:08:02] morning
[1:08:04] don't you ever quit
[1:08:07] one of these days is where it's going to
[1:08:09] be so remade
[1:08:11] it's so beautiful
[1:08:13] this earth's beauty he created it in
[1:08:15] such a way
[1:08:18] and jesus is thinking not only about the
[1:08:21] natural realm
[1:08:22] but he's thinking about that eternal
[1:08:24] realm
[1:08:26] you remember in in 1st thessalonians 4
[1:08:28] he talks about rapture
[1:08:31] but before he talks about rapture
[1:08:33] he talks about the conduct of people
[1:08:37] the early part of first thessalonians 4
[1:08:41] of the character of people that's going
[1:08:44] to live there
[1:08:46] because remember in that realm
[1:08:49] there's no sin
[1:08:54] you deal with it at mcdonald's
[1:09:01] you deal with it definitely at walmart
[1:09:07] i'm sorry charles
[1:09:10] i don't know how you work there
[1:09:14] but we're going to a place where there's
[1:09:16] no sin
[1:09:18] nobody thinks an evil thought
[1:09:22] this is not even involved
[1:09:26] it's you know there's no
[1:09:29] there's never going to be adultery there
[1:09:32] there's never going to be a lie ever
[1:09:35] told there
[1:09:37] there's never going to be a war
[1:09:39] there
[1:09:40] not a death there's not going to be a
[1:09:42] leaf fall off of the tree there
[1:09:45] we can't imagine it
[1:09:46] but he's going to have a people
[1:09:49] that have been so orchestrated in their
[1:09:52] lives
[1:09:54] that they can live in that kind of
[1:09:56] continuous condition
[1:10:00] hallelujah
[1:10:03] [Music]
[1:10:06] this is a powerful scripture blessed are
[1:10:08] the peacemakers
[1:10:12] for they shall be called
[1:10:14] the children of god
[1:10:18] blessed are they which are persecuted
[1:10:19] for for righteousness sake for theirs is
[1:10:22] the kingdom of heaven
[1:10:25] blessed are you when men shall revile
[1:10:27] you and persecute you say all manner of
[1:10:29] evil against you
[1:10:31] falsely for my sake
[1:10:33] rejoice and be exceedingly glad
[1:10:36] for great is your reward in heaven for
[1:10:38] so persecuted the prophets before you
[1:10:41] now i want you to honor this you're the
[1:10:44] salt of the earth
[1:10:46] you're the preserver
[1:10:49] are you with me
[1:10:50] wherever you are wherever you're
[1:10:52] watching this you are preserving your
[1:10:54] community
[1:10:57] your prayers of this day as evil as this
[1:11:00] day is your prayers are preserving where
[1:11:04] you're at but one day you won't be here
[1:11:09] you're the salt of the earth but if the
[1:11:11] salt has lost it save though wherewith
[1:11:13] shall it be salted it stents forth good
[1:11:15] for nothing but it's cast out and to be
[1:11:17] trodden under the foot of men year the
[1:11:20] light of the world
[1:11:22] a city that is set on a hill that cannot
[1:11:24] be hid neither do men light a candle and
[1:11:27] put it under a bushel but on a
[1:11:29] candlestick but it giveth light unto all
[1:11:32] that are in the house
[1:11:33] let your light
[1:11:36] so shine before men
[1:11:38] that they may see your good works
[1:11:41] and not glorify you but glorify the
[1:11:44] father which is in heaven
[1:11:49] we are reflecting him
[1:12:00] now
[1:12:04] if we can just think about this
[1:12:07] there's no way we can comprehend the
[1:12:09] mind of god
[1:12:11] in all of his pre-planning
[1:12:16] and brother george
[1:12:18] quinn
[1:12:19] took me by a house and pointed me to a
[1:12:23] man that had spent 40 years
[1:12:27] 40 years
[1:12:29] studying a cockroach
[1:12:35] he spent his entire
[1:12:37] working life
[1:12:40] studying
[1:12:41] a cockroach
[1:12:43] that you and i do not want in our house
[1:12:54] and god said let there be
[1:12:58] from the smallest ant
[1:13:02] to the biggest animal
[1:13:08] nothing let's just go another step
[1:13:11] if we can
[1:13:13] there was a man with nasa
[1:13:17] and they sent
[1:13:18] they sent an instrument into the heavens
[1:13:22] and he had watched that for 40 years and
[1:13:25] now he's retiring
[1:13:29] he'd watched it every day the pictures
[1:13:32] had came back every day of what that
[1:13:35] instrument was taking pictures of
[1:13:40] and god created all of that
[1:13:43] and that man and he actually studies
[1:13:46] those pictures every day
[1:13:50] he was just literally
[1:13:52] studying what god created
[1:13:56] whether it's mountains or the deepest of
[1:13:58] the sea god created it
[1:14:02] but let me just say god
[1:14:04] had you in his mind
[1:14:08] and you're the highest of any specie
[1:14:11] you're a reflection of himself
[1:14:15] he created angels to serve and worship
[1:14:18] him but he wanted something that would
[1:14:20] be his mate
[1:14:23] he was king and he wanted a queen
[1:14:27] sure there's a lot of churches but he
[1:14:29] wanted a bride
[1:14:32] he wanted a wife that he could marry
[1:14:34] himself to that would reflect his
[1:14:37] character
[1:14:46] why not churches
[1:14:48] oh there be redeemed from churches
[1:14:54] but you don't want to marry a wife
[1:14:56] that goes through the bible says i don't
[1:14:58] want that part i don't want that part i
[1:14:59] don't want that part i don't believe
[1:15:00] that part i don't believe that first
[1:15:08] i can't live that part i ain't gonna do
[1:15:09] that part i'm not gonna do that part i'm
[1:15:11] not gonna and he don't want you as a
[1:15:12] wife
[1:15:14] so you see it wasn't that god turned you
[1:15:17] down you turned yourself down
[1:15:19] don't blame god god don't send no person
[1:15:22] to hell he don't send no person through
[1:15:25] the tribulation period
[1:15:27] but your life reflects where you're
[1:15:30] going
[1:15:44] brother brandon would scream
[1:15:47] get back in step
[1:15:49] right
[1:15:50] and he would stream that in that vision
[1:15:53] get back in step
[1:15:55] because we as humanity
[1:15:58] attitudes
[1:16:01] thoughts
[1:16:03] even choices that we make send us down
[1:16:06] roads
[1:16:08] and men are standing in pulpits
[1:16:11] screaming
[1:16:12] stay in line
[1:16:14] stay in line don't get mad at ministry
[1:16:17] don't get mad at what god sent us the
[1:16:20] dress where to get you ready
[1:16:25] well i don't like that preacher i don't
[1:16:27] like that man i don't like this god
[1:16:28] sends different ministries
[1:16:31] and he builds them a certain way
[1:16:34] to prepare you
[1:16:40] brother brown prays a prayer
[1:16:43] and he said may our lives be so
[1:16:45] submitted to thee that the holy spirit
[1:16:49] will live itself through us
[1:16:52] and speak through us lord
[1:16:54] may we remember in our minds as we walk
[1:16:58] upon the street and rub our arms with
[1:17:00] the world
[1:17:01] that we're not suppo supposed to be like
[1:17:04] those
[1:17:05] we step aside and give them the place
[1:17:09] lord in their rightful position here on
[1:17:11] earth
[1:17:12] we'll take a back seat
[1:17:14] knowing that we are delegates from
[1:17:17] another world
[1:17:20] we have a kingdom that's coming into
[1:17:22] power
[1:17:23] and our great king will soon arrive and
[1:17:26] take over all the kingdoms that's in his
[1:17:29] domain and he shall rule and reign with
[1:17:32] and we shall rule and he shall rule and
[1:17:34] reign and him on the earth thousand
[1:17:36] years
[1:17:38] and be with him
[1:17:40] forever
[1:17:45] so a man has to surrender every ambition
[1:17:47] that he's got to his will
[1:17:50] everything that he's got
[1:17:53] prophet would speak a sermon called paul
[1:17:55] a prisoner i think it's a good sermon
[1:17:56] for you to listen to maybe this week
[1:17:59] paul a prisoner is one of the most
[1:18:00] powerful sermons that brother branham
[1:18:02] preaches
[1:18:03] and he's talking about our humanity
[1:18:06] our ambitions
[1:18:09] he's talking about how that we carry out
[1:18:12] our lives that we are a prisoner to
[1:18:16] jesus christ
[1:18:18] and you say well that's a difficult task
[1:18:21] brother branham brother brandon points
[1:18:23] out that paul called himself that
[1:18:28] being a prisoner to rome but he was also
[1:18:30] a prisoner to jesus christ
[1:18:34] jesus was standing in
[1:18:37] in john chapter 14 and verse 1.
[1:18:41] and he says this and now i'd like to
[1:18:43] just take this again two worlds
[1:18:46] let not your heart be troubled
[1:18:50] you believe in god
[1:18:52] we believe also in me
[1:18:55] in my father's houses
[1:18:58] in my father's house
[1:19:01] are many mansions
[1:19:03] and if it were not so
[1:19:06] i would have told you
[1:19:08] i go
[1:19:09] to prepare a place for you
[1:19:11] now he could only say this to his inner
[1:19:14] circle of disciples because they would
[1:19:16] understand
[1:19:20] there were certain things that brother
[1:19:21] branham could only say to believers
[1:19:25] because believers would understand
[1:19:28] but i want to say this to you
[1:19:30] we're not too interested in the critic
[1:19:33] or the unbeliever to start off with
[1:19:36] i think so many times that we waste a
[1:19:38] lot of time
[1:19:40] trying to convert a goat
[1:19:46] or a devil
[1:19:49] in sheep's clothing
[1:19:52] that's not going to spend eternal life
[1:19:54] with us anyway
[1:19:57] are you with me now
[1:19:59] well how you know it buy their fruits
[1:20:04] by their fruits you you'll know them
[1:20:09] that's not being judgmental it's by
[1:20:12] their fruits by their life
[1:20:22] i want to read this for purpose
[1:20:25] isaiah chapter 53 and verse one you hear
[1:20:28] it here probably every week
[1:20:30] who hath believed our report into to
[1:20:32] whom is the arm of the lord revealed
[1:20:39] and verse 4
[1:20:41] surely he hath borne our griefs
[1:20:44] and carried our sorrows
[1:20:46] yet we did esteem him stricken and
[1:20:48] smitten of god and afflicted
[1:20:50] but he was wounded for our
[1:20:53] transgressions
[1:20:55] he was bruised for
[1:20:57] our iniquities
[1:20:59] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:21:02] him and without with his stripes
[1:21:06] we
[1:21:07] are healed
[1:21:11] i was having a brain immoral on
[1:21:16] wednesday
[1:21:17] early wednesday morning i had the first
[1:21:18] appointment
[1:21:20] old people like the first appointment
[1:21:24] and so
[1:21:25] so anyway that's for most of us anyway
[1:21:28] so
[1:21:30] and so
[1:21:30] so anyway i was sitting and was a new
[1:21:33] nurse i hadn't met her before
[1:21:35] she was preparing me for the brain mri
[1:21:38] and
[1:21:39] and
[1:21:40] she was getting me ready she was a woman
[1:21:43] about my age
[1:21:44] and she had great gray hair in the front
[1:21:46] and the rest of it was kind of a
[1:21:47] chestnut brown and i never met her
[1:21:51] she was telling me her life story
[1:21:53] matthew says everybody seems to want to
[1:21:55] tell me their life story and so
[1:21:57] i just sat and listened for a while and
[1:22:00] she was going through i think it's about
[1:22:01] 50 questions that they give you before
[1:22:04] you go through and it's a yes or no or
[1:22:07] expand on it a little bit and i noticed
[1:22:09] she paused for a little while she was
[1:22:11] reading
[1:22:12] and i said well
[1:22:13] what are you reading she said
[1:22:15] i'm reading your report here
[1:22:18] and she said your report here says that
[1:22:21] you're a very sick man
[1:22:25] i said oh it doesn't she said yeah she
[1:22:28] said but you don't look like your report
[1:22:46] so your report might be bad but you
[1:22:48] don't look like your report
[1:22:56] timmy i guess i have to say this to you
[1:22:58] the devil may have a whole list of
[1:23:00] things that he's got against you but you
[1:23:02] don't look like that report
[1:23:12] now brother branham is going to speak
[1:23:14] shalom
[1:23:16] i'm not going to get done today but i'm
[1:23:18] just going to speak a while and is this
[1:23:19] okay if i just trying to take my time
[1:23:22] it kind of feels relaxed in here doesn't
[1:23:23] it and so brother branham is going to
[1:23:25] speak shalom
[1:23:27] now remember he's a prophet
[1:23:29] as a prophet he's not a normal speaker
[1:23:32] he's a prophet and he'll walk in be very
[1:23:35] cordial to the audience and
[1:23:37] and because of people's faith and
[1:23:39] expectation people will get healed as he
[1:23:41] walks to the platform because they've
[1:23:43] seen so many miracles
[1:23:45] brother branham has a different way of
[1:23:47] talking he's he's got that a hillbilly
[1:23:49] talking
[1:23:50] he's just talking he makes us all feel
[1:23:52] comfortable whether you're from africa
[1:23:54] or zimbabwe or wherever you're from or
[1:23:57] ireland or switzerland he just had a way
[1:23:59] of just making us all just relaxed and
[1:24:02] he would talk to us about what god
[1:24:04] thought of us
[1:24:06] talk to us about how god called us from
[1:24:08] another realm
[1:24:09] and you know
[1:24:11] you know just after the seals and god
[1:24:13] hit and re reeled in simplicity
[1:24:16] and and then the seals are released and
[1:24:18] that's
[1:24:19] god himself opening in the word to the
[1:24:21] bride
[1:24:22] and it's to the bride and all of the
[1:24:24] bride's going to understand it and so
[1:24:26] night after night brother brahma would
[1:24:27] say he said now i don't know what
[1:24:28] tomorrow night is
[1:24:31] and then the next night he would come
[1:24:32] and say he met me in the room
[1:24:36] the same one that met moses
[1:24:38] that met enoch
[1:24:40] that stood there and said blessed are ye
[1:24:44] blessed are the peacemakers
[1:24:47] and if you can look past the veil
[1:24:49] and hear god
[1:24:52] because that's the sheep music
[1:24:54] if you fall in love with brother branham
[1:24:56] you missed the picture
[1:25:00] if you come on this hill and fall in
[1:25:01] love with me or andrew you missed the
[1:25:03] picture because there's a mightier one
[1:25:06] that is here
[1:25:15] but the brand will say i can't see past
[1:25:17] 1977.
[1:25:19] but many of you were born after 1977. so
[1:25:22] god knew that there's going to be people
[1:25:23] that were in darkness that would have
[1:25:26] great light
[1:25:31] and ye are the light of the world
[1:25:37] so
[1:25:38] brother branham will come and speak a
[1:25:40] sermon on shalom
[1:25:43] and in shalom he will
[1:25:46] talk about how dark and how gross dark
[1:25:47] it is
[1:25:50] and then he will begin to talk about a
[1:25:52] symphony
[1:25:54] peter and the wolf
[1:25:56] and he'll talk about the symphony how
[1:25:58] that everything has its place and has
[1:26:00] its timing and
[1:26:02] even even that little little little
[1:26:04] little little bell
[1:26:06] everything is just exactly right on time
[1:26:08] and then he said
[1:26:09] now it'll sound like a bunch of rocket
[1:26:11] to you if you don't understand the music
[1:26:17] well you're not going to hear this in in
[1:26:18] the nominal churches
[1:26:21] and so brother branham is beginning to
[1:26:23] take us all the way
[1:26:25] and he begins to show us
[1:26:27] begins to show us how that god has been
[1:26:29] all the way down to the end through
[1:26:32] since the beginning
[1:26:33] as a
[1:26:34] symphony playing out the music
[1:26:38] and he has certain characters to play
[1:26:40] certain parts
[1:26:42] any any any and then he comes down now
[1:26:44] it's your turn now it's your place
[1:26:49] he said to the world they're not
[1:26:51] interested in it
[1:26:53] it sounds like a bunch of racket to them
[1:26:57] but if i can paraphrase the bride is
[1:27:00] interested
[1:27:03] [Applause]
[1:27:04] are you with me
[1:27:06] so
[1:27:07] sister cassie you'll like this
[1:27:10] so friday night i spent
[1:27:13] i spent about two hours listening to
[1:27:14] beethoven
[1:27:18] ten minutes with chopin
[1:27:21] so
[1:27:22] a little bit with bach
[1:27:26] but i'm interested in that kind of music
[1:27:29] because everything is just right listen
[1:27:32] that's not having just anybody come to
[1:27:34] play
[1:27:39] best of best
[1:27:43] so i googled you google i googled what
[1:27:47] made beethoven
[1:27:49] so special
[1:27:55] and it was in his thoughts
[1:27:58] that my music is not just for a
[1:28:01] generation
[1:28:02] but it's for eternity
[1:28:07] he said i'm not just playing to please
[1:28:09] people here
[1:28:10] but i want my music for eternity i
[1:28:13] thought about god
[1:28:16] moses writes
[1:28:18] jeremiah writes ezekiel writes nahum
[1:28:22] writes obadiah rots
[1:28:26] paul writes your new testament
[1:28:30] everyone just in its right place
[1:28:35] if it was not for history
[1:28:37] you would have a hard time figuring out
[1:28:39] paul's in prison and in chains and
[1:28:42] locked up
[1:28:44] and what a difficult because he's
[1:28:46] playing the music in such a way it's not
[1:28:48] paul playing
[1:28:50] it's got through paul playing
[1:28:53] [Applause]
[1:29:00] brother brandon would take the pulp out
[1:29:06] for us we know
[1:29:08] but he take the pulpit in many places in
[1:29:10] the world
[1:29:13] and he didn't tell him what to some pity
[1:29:15] party
[1:29:17] he didn't he didn't tell him i was from
[1:29:19] a
[1:29:19] bootlegger's son
[1:29:22] i'm here to represent jesus christ
[1:29:26] and he came with a representation
[1:29:29] that i'm here to reflect him
[1:29:32] i think we make a very big mistake
[1:29:35] if we're not here to reflect jesus
[1:29:38] christ
[1:29:46] now
[1:29:50] beethoven came to a spot actually
[1:29:53] actually what my understanding is and i
[1:29:55] can be corrected later
[1:29:57] but my understanding that his greatest
[1:29:59] masterpieces came
[1:30:01] after
[1:30:03] he became deaf
[1:30:06] he became an isolationist
[1:30:08] and in his isolationist he became very
[1:30:11] agitated
[1:30:13] in crowds
[1:30:15] and he he didn't like to be around
[1:30:17] people and that made him moody and made
[1:30:20] him hateful
[1:30:21] and yet he was doing his best work
[1:30:26] are you with me i'm gonna preach now
[1:30:29] the devil does not know what he's doing
[1:30:32] when he gives a man cancer
[1:30:42] i want to lay some things here for us
[1:30:44] just for a moment because we're here
[1:30:45] we're living it
[1:30:46] this ain't a fiction book we're living
[1:30:48] this thing
[1:30:49] so the devil can't touch a hair of our
[1:30:52] head until he gets permission from god
[1:30:55] so he goes and gets permission from god
[1:30:57] you got a preacher down there that's
[1:30:59] given me a whole lot of trouble and i'd
[1:31:01] like to tempt his life i'd like to touch
[1:31:03] his flesh for a while and god said go
[1:31:05] ahead
[1:31:06] he's going to be more powerful he's
[1:31:08] going to be stronger i'm going to trust
[1:31:10] him like never before
[1:31:13] he's going to shake your kingdom up
[1:31:31] so beethoven cuts the legs off of the
[1:31:35] off of the piano
[1:31:37] and places the piano on the
[1:31:39] wooden floor
[1:31:41] and so now he can't hear the music
[1:31:45] but the vibrations will he be in his ear
[1:31:49] and so he writes his masterpiece work
[1:31:52] here's something i didn't know
[1:31:54] he would go to the back of the concert
[1:31:57] hall
[1:31:59] and put his ear on the floor
[1:32:02] and listen to when the director would
[1:32:04] play his music
[1:32:08] and listen nobody in the building knew
[1:32:10] that the real guy was in the building
[1:32:13] but he was back there making sure they
[1:32:15] did it right
[1:32:17] in another realm
[1:32:20] in another realm
[1:32:22] there's a god that's watching over the
[1:32:24] the participants of this orchestra
[1:32:27] watching
[1:32:30] they dress right they walk right they
[1:32:32] talk right their character's right
[1:32:35] they're filled with the spirit of god
[1:32:38] they're playing the music
[1:32:40] [Applause]
[1:33:03] brother brown would explain to us that
[1:33:06] when they mold the bell
[1:33:08] they'll put certain
[1:33:12] certain
[1:33:14] chemicals or certain
[1:33:17] i'm looking for the word
[1:33:19] there's certain
[1:33:20] wars but there's a
[1:33:23] certain composites
[1:33:25] that put it together
[1:33:26] to have a certain sound
[1:33:31] it is said that there's no bird
[1:33:34] has the same sound that's incredible
[1:33:40] no cricket
[1:33:42] has the same sound
[1:33:45] every one of them is just a touch
[1:33:47] off of the other
[1:33:50] brother shannon
[1:33:52] it is said that your
[1:33:55] life's companion
[1:33:58] when you were so upset in life
[1:34:01] your life's companion
[1:34:03] her giggle
[1:34:08] calms you
[1:34:14] think about how god built us
[1:34:19] dandelion
[1:34:23] sunflower seeds
[1:34:27] beautiful forests that we've got here
[1:34:33] god built it for you
[1:34:38] now there's millions and billions
[1:34:40] because of the
[1:34:41] the nature and the fall of man
[1:34:43] but through all that god's got a seed
[1:34:48] god's got a seed
[1:34:50] and it's not that you could gather
[1:34:52] yourself to it
[1:34:58] predestination we love this church we
[1:35:00] love what's going on here
[1:35:03] but somewhere another this lady sitting
[1:35:05] over here in pink
[1:35:10] there was a boy
[1:35:11] chased her around the building and
[1:35:14] kissed her
[1:35:19] and she fell in love with that boy
[1:35:24] knowing his reputation
[1:35:26] but she couldn't see the powerhouse
[1:35:29] that was laying on the inside of him
[1:35:34] [Applause]
[1:35:47] sister nancy and the eternities
[1:35:51] you'll set with queens
[1:35:55] [Music]
[1:35:59] you're set with queens
[1:36:04] sister branham would be just down the
[1:36:06] road
[1:36:12] wasn't just some little frilly girl
[1:36:15] god was watching over he was
[1:36:17] orchestrating
[1:36:19] you had to live here
[1:36:22] because two seeds had to come together
[1:36:28] come on church
[1:36:30] listen it wasn't you
[1:36:32] found your way in
[1:36:34] god got a hold of you
[1:36:37] maybe you didn't understand it maybe
[1:36:39] actually you was against it for quite a
[1:36:41] while and one day the light came on
[1:36:44] [Applause]
[1:36:46] the light come on and you saw yourself
[1:36:49] and before long you're playing the music
[1:36:53] there may have been moments that you
[1:36:54] struggle with certain parts of it
[1:36:59] maybe you didn't understand hair maybe
[1:37:01] you didn't understand baptism maybe you
[1:37:03] didn't understand god sent a prophet
[1:37:05] maybe you didn't understand where you
[1:37:06] were in the scriptures and then you just
[1:37:08] kept looking at it and maybe even
[1:37:11] fighting it
[1:37:19] god don't get worry with you
[1:37:23] he don't get weary with you
[1:37:28] he doesn't get weary
[1:37:31] he gives you all the time in the world

[1:41:06] school she's going to affect hundreds
[1:41:09] and hundreds of people
[1:41:11] and people if tom last people are going
[1:41:13] to look back there was a godly teacher
[1:41:15] that loved and cared people of broken
[1:41:18] homes people that had devastated lives
[1:41:22] and there was one person
[1:41:28] one person in god's orchestra that was
[1:41:31] standing and playing
[1:41:33] [Applause]
[1:41:39] david could you stand
[1:41:43] davey had two children that was getting
[1:41:44] ready to come doctor said it was
[1:41:46] impossible a wreck said it was
[1:41:48] impossible his wife's doctor said it was
[1:41:51] impossible but the vision said you're
[1:41:53] going to have children
[1:41:55] davey as a young man
[1:41:58] was standing on the porch
[1:42:00] and he told me he said brother ron i'm
[1:42:02] he said i'm working beside of people
[1:42:03] that's making double sometimes even
[1:42:05] triple what i'm making he said but
[1:42:08] but
[1:42:09] you know should i take that job should i
[1:42:12] go to job work with them i'm doing the
[1:42:13] same thing they're doing they're making
[1:42:15] double even triple what i'm what i'm
[1:42:16] making and he said
[1:42:18] could you pray about it
[1:42:20] i did
[1:42:23] i'm not your holy ghost
[1:42:25] but i pray you ask me to pray i pray i
[1:42:27] legitimately pray
[1:42:30] and so i prayed
[1:42:33] the next week then i told him something
[1:42:35] that was just crazy
[1:42:37] don't take it
[1:42:40] now that sounds for the natural carnal
[1:42:42] man says i'm doing the same thing
[1:42:44] they're doing and they're making double
[1:42:45] triple what i'm doing i'm putting at the
[1:42:47] same time they're getting triple money
[1:42:50] what i'm doing
[1:42:52] they move them to mexico within the next
[1:42:55] week or so
[1:42:57] and davey would have had to gone to
[1:42:58] mexico
[1:43:00] but he needed to be here to marry my
[1:43:01] daughter he had two children that had to
[1:43:03] come
[1:43:13] brother jordan and sister kirsten we
[1:43:14] baptize them in old order clothes how'd
[1:43:16] they got here i'll never figure out
[1:43:20] but god that is rich in mercy
[1:43:33] brother ron but i don't see the results
[1:43:35] look right here
[1:43:45] don't look at the short term of your
[1:43:47] life
[1:43:48] don't look at the short term of your
[1:43:50] life decades later look back
[1:43:54] maybe you can't see the will of god
[1:43:56] under your feet but decades later look
[1:43:59] back and say god knew me there
[1:44:02] god placed me there
[1:44:04] god put me under that word
[1:44:06] [Applause]
[1:44:21] none of us want to put a fish if we're
[1:44:23] drawing put a fish in a tree that's not
[1:44:25] its rightful place
[1:44:29] none of us want to reflect
[1:44:31] hollywood and its nonsense
[1:44:34] or even this music generation and it's
[1:44:36] nonsense
[1:44:38] or even some feeble man
[1:44:42] we want to reflect christ
[1:44:46] that's the reason it tells us to eat the
[1:44:48] book
[1:44:50] and have the life of jesus christ
[1:44:53] you hear us worship here
[1:44:56] now listen don't get offended at us
[1:44:59] we may be the noisy part of heaven
[1:45:03] but we're in the orchestra
[1:45:11] not everybody's going to play the trump
[1:45:13] the triangle or do a brush some of us
[1:45:16] are going to be noisy
[1:45:19] you're going to need some warriors for
[1:45:21] the fight you're going to need some
[1:45:23] worship leaders
[1:45:25] [Applause]
[1:45:33] now let me just say this to you
[1:45:36] sometimes you don't understand people
[1:45:39] some of you as a child
[1:45:41] watched andrew and matthew grow up
[1:45:44] never in your mind saw them as leaders
[1:45:46] here in this church
[1:45:48] they didn't get that because of me
[1:45:51] or even brother homer
[1:45:58] pretty protective for this pulpit
[1:46:01] but god anointed them to be worship
[1:46:03] leaders
[1:46:06] to lead you in worship to prepare you
[1:46:08] for the coming word
[1:46:10] to get you in an atmosphere to bring you
[1:46:13] from from difficulties at home
[1:46:15] difficulties on your job
[1:46:17] difficulties in your life and to bring
[1:46:20] you into an atmosphere where you can
[1:46:22] feed on the word
[1:46:25] to get your mind off of all of those
[1:46:27] things
[1:46:31] now no doubt
[1:46:33] no doubt as in many other places
[1:46:37] brother timothy pruitt which is a
[1:46:38] worship warrior
[1:46:40] i was there in the days when people
[1:46:43] became
[1:46:44] became jealous of timothy
[1:46:46] didn't want him to be the song leader
[1:46:49] man left the church
[1:46:51] didn't want him singing certain songs
[1:46:53] that were rejoice songs
[1:46:56] you know they they got all upset
[1:46:59] but you were it wasn't man-appointed
[1:47:05] god could care less about humanity's
[1:47:08] feelings
[1:47:09] i'm gonna preach i'm not done
[1:47:12] he's he can care less about your
[1:47:13] feelings and your opinions and your
[1:47:16] thoughts on an issue
[1:47:18] he has raised up a man for a purpose and
[1:47:21] that man will carry out that purpose as
[1:47:24] a prisoner to jesus christ
[1:47:26] he will play the music
[1:47:30] he will be the part he will reflect
[1:47:33] jesus christ
[1:47:41] tim could not brother tim could not make
[1:47:44] timothy a worship warrior
[1:47:46] he could not make him a convention
[1:47:48] speaker like he is today
[1:47:54] god did that
[1:47:57] as i watched andrew after he preached
[1:47:59] last night
[1:48:00] no doubt our minds go back to brother
[1:48:02] homer
[1:48:03] but brother homer
[1:48:06] he could not make andrew do that
[1:48:10] listen if we had that ability
[1:48:14] you would make your children serve god
[1:48:17] be on fire for god set right here
[1:48:21] but god that's rich in mercy
[1:48:25] it'll take the same experience for them
[1:48:27] that it did for you
[1:48:29] and god's faithful enough to go meet
[1:48:32] them
[1:48:32] [Applause]
[1:48:33] he'll take you from the back seat to the
[1:48:35] front seat he'll set you on fire
[1:48:41] [Applause]
[1:48:55] without raising your hands
[1:48:58] how many has ever what's the ten
[1:49:00] commandments
[1:49:04] thank you
[1:49:07] a man named charleston heston played the
[1:49:09] part
[1:49:11] charleston heston
[1:49:13] those that know him in his
[1:49:15] real life was was a man that was an nra
[1:49:18] advocate
[1:49:20] said a lot of things
[1:49:21] about the nra
[1:49:23] and
[1:49:25] but he studied the life of moses the
[1:49:28] character of moses the ways of moses
[1:49:31] the history of moses
[1:49:34] until when he stepped into the part
[1:49:40] he actually had to go into an
[1:49:42] institution
[1:49:45] to step out of the part
[1:49:47] amen
[1:49:48] think about that
[1:49:50] because he actually came to a spot
[1:49:53] to where he thought he was moses
[1:49:58] that's what happens in religion
[1:50:03] and if you can do that without a new
[1:50:05] birth
[1:50:09] to where people think they're a
[1:50:10] christian
[1:50:12] but really don't have the life
[1:50:16] you just need the new birth
[1:50:18] because the new birth what will it do
[1:50:20] let me just let me just stop you just
[1:50:22] for a moment christ comes himself inside
[1:50:25] of you it'll cause emotions it'll cause
[1:50:28] tongues speaking it'll cause visions
[1:50:30] it'll cause being able to cast out
[1:50:31] levels
[1:50:32] but it'll take sin out of your life
[1:50:36] it'll take filthy habits out of your
[1:50:38] life it'll cleanse you
[1:50:42] it'll change your habits it'll change
[1:50:44] your friendships
[1:50:47] you want to make nothing christ wants to
[1:50:49] come and live on the inside of you
[1:50:51] so you become a star
[1:50:54] that reflects him
[1:51:02] brother gene i would say where you work
[1:51:04] at you haven't been there wrong but i
[1:51:06] would say already people recognize you
[1:51:08] as a christian
[1:51:12] isn't that true
[1:51:14] and you don't have to say a word
[1:51:17] it's what you don't do that says light
[1:51:22] sometimes some people say well i want to
[1:51:23] be a chatterbox and be a christian i
[1:51:25] want to be a witness testimony just be
[1:51:27] quiet
[1:51:30] just be real quiet
[1:51:32] just
[1:51:33] yeah sure there's times to talk there's
[1:51:34] times to
[1:51:35] just be still
[1:51:37] i want you understand jesus says some
[1:51:38] powerful things
[1:51:40] but in his quietness and his silence
[1:51:44] he's more powerful
[1:51:49] he could have called 10 000 angels to
[1:51:50] come and set him free
[1:51:52] just one would have did it
[1:51:57] now
[1:51:58] i'm not going to get done so let me just
[1:52:00] come to this point
[1:52:03] brother bram's laying with his hands
[1:52:05] behind his head
[1:52:06] and he says
[1:52:08] he's actually laying there thinking
[1:52:09] about
[1:52:11] you know to me what he's done at that
[1:52:13] point
[1:52:14] is phenomenal it's the enough to write a
[1:52:16] library is full of what the
[1:52:18] accomplishments that god's had in his
[1:52:20] life
[1:52:21] and he's saying
[1:52:23] i've done nothing for christ
[1:52:25] i haven't did anything
[1:52:27] it's kind of how you feel
[1:52:28] you heard andrew say last night he said
[1:52:31] sometimes you feel like a christian
[1:52:32] sometimes you don't that's a direct
[1:52:33] quote from brother branham he said
[1:52:35] there's days i feel like a christian or
[1:52:36] today's adult
[1:52:38] so don't you feel like you're some odd
[1:52:40] bird
[1:52:41] because you've got an enemy fighting you
[1:52:44] and you're still dealing with your
[1:52:45] humanity
[1:52:49] and in just a moment the angel asked him
[1:52:52] would you like to look beyond the
[1:52:53] curtain of time
[1:52:54] i'm still on my subject
[1:52:58] and just he looked back at his body
[1:53:00] there was his body laying there
[1:53:02] then when he gets there
[1:53:04] brother craig is
[1:53:05] he looks down at his hands and his hands
[1:53:07] are young
[1:53:09] and he comes to a point to where he rubs
[1:53:10] his hair and he's he's got hair
[1:53:13] that's nice
[1:53:14] he's got hair
[1:53:15] maybe he should point that he's got here
[1:53:20] and
[1:53:22] brother branham
[1:53:24] he begins to meet people
[1:53:25] that dimension he feels perfect love
[1:53:29] he didn't feel that laying on a bed but
[1:53:31] in that dimension he feels perfect love
[1:53:35] and there's women that comes up and hugs
[1:53:37] him and he doesn't feel
[1:53:43] because in that dimension that's not
[1:53:44] there
[1:53:46] and the angel asked him
[1:53:48] he said do you do you recognize that
[1:53:50] lady
[1:53:51] that sister
[1:53:52] he said you led her to christ past 95
[1:53:55] and she was a young woman
[1:53:59] you know we look at death much different
[1:54:01] than god looks at death
[1:54:03] we sorrow we cry we agonize but if we
[1:54:06] could look in that eternal realm
[1:54:09] my mom
[1:54:10] my father
[1:54:12] stepped beyond the realm of time brother
[1:54:14] homer stepped beyond the realm of time
[1:54:16] and stepped into a well body
[1:54:20] now they long to come back to this room
[1:54:22] to see us
[1:54:23] and then we'll go to see the lord
[1:54:26] and brother bran was asking he asked are
[1:54:28] these my are these are these my family
[1:54:31] are these my these are my converts i
[1:54:32] said you're converts
[1:54:36] and he said well will i be accepted and
[1:54:37] he said i preach what paul preached
[1:54:42] i preached what peter preached
[1:54:45] and he said
[1:54:46] and all of us begin to scream we're
[1:54:49] resting on that
[1:54:51] so the sheep music we don't need to
[1:54:53] change
[1:54:57] it's not about you know
[1:54:59] we come over to a certain part well i
[1:55:00] don't want to play that part
[1:55:03] so i'll just skip it
