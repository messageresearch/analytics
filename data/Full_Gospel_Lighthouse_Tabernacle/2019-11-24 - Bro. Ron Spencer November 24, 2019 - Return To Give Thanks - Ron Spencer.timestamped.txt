[1:00] reasons but the Fraser dinner happened
[1:05] today and there was a lot of reasons
[1:07] there if I seem to have a lot of energy
[1:10] tonight and there was a lot of sweets

[1:52] to share with you there are certain
[1:54] people we think in our prayers for
[1:58] things that we appreciate so but try as
[2:01] we may we sometimes can't say the words
[2:04] that we want them to know there are
[2:08] people often who often go out of their
[2:11] way to pitch in when there's work to be
[2:13] done they show understanding and lighten
[2:16] our problems they help us in more ways
[2:19] than one there are certain people that

[6:23] like you just be right at home
[6:25] havin having coffee and donuts with and
[6:29] so I've been doing that for a lot of
[6:32] years with him and so I have found it
[6:36] when you see and preach you you can't
[6:39] hardly see that he was once a trapper on
[6:42] a trapline and uses snowmobiles and
[6:45] sleeping out there and his sub-zero
[6:47] weather through the wind
[6:49] and well we just love him and sister
[6:52] Maura and they've been just really
[6:54] really wonderful friends I I can I can
[6:58] take you back and it was in 2003 that
[7:01] brother Harold Hildebrandt we were going
[7:04] to church and he said I I have a cousin
[7:08] and his name's Kelly
[7:10] and he's come to the meeting and he
[7:13] really needs a friend and I said dude he
[7:16] said yeah he said he'll probably be the
[7:18] only one that quite looks like he has he
[7:20] said it's got dark rimmed glasses and
[7:22] he's tall and he's dark headed and he
[7:26] said he needs a friend and I said well
[7:29] I'll make him a good friend he didn't
[7:33] know me at that time but I I met him
[7:37] after service and we spoke and and then
[7:40] it began to bill from that
[7:41] you know friendship says uh you know
[7:44] there's a there's a two-way thing you
[7:46] have to be to be a friend or to have a
[7:49] friend you got to be a friend a man you
[7:52] said well brother Ron I I'd like to I'd
[7:54] like to have more friends in my life
[7:55] well you you got to put some work into
[7:57] it and so so we're just so thankful that
[8:00] we can have friends like you and have a
[8:03] like this that he wants to come so many
[8:06] years in a row and we don't take it for
[8:08] granted something else I don't take for
[8:10] granted and this is where I was going
[8:12] with all of that I'd like for you to
[8:14] pray that we have somewhat decent
[8:16] weather next week and so he'll be flying
[8:19] in on Friday night and and as you're
[8:22] hearing the stories are that there's
[8:24] there's weather that isn't going to be
[8:26] in the United States and gonna mess up
[8:28] travel I just pray that God watches over
[8:30] those planes and gets those planes here
[8:33] and so I just pray that that goes
[8:35] wailing and then for our meeting next
[8:37] week harder I I don't know if I'm ready
[8:40] for the snow yet sister Connie hasn't
[8:42] put out any let it's no signs yet so so
[8:45] maybe she's waiting on it for a little
[8:47] while and so amen god bless you and I
[8:50] pray that you have a wonderful
[8:51] Thanksgiving and so that's what that's
[8:54] what I want to wish here this evening a
[8:56] man if you will turn with me in your
[8:58] scriptures to Luke chapter 17 and verse
[9:00] 11
[9:02] I'd like to speak you to you tonight on
[9:04] return to give thanks return to give
[9:10] things 17 and verse 11 of Luke and it
[9:21] came to pass as he went to Jerusalem
[9:25] that he passed through the midst of
[9:27] Samaria and Galilee and he entered into
[9:31] a certain village and there met him ten
[9:34] men that were lepers which stood afar
[9:38] off and they lifted up their voices and
[9:41] said Jesus master have mercy on us
[9:49] probably their only chance in life
[9:52] and opportunities come will you take
[9:56] advantage of it and when he saw them he
[10:01] said unto them go show yourselves unto
[10:07] the priests and it came to pass that as
[10:11] they went they were cleansed now notice
[10:18] this and one of them when he saw that he
[10:22] was healed turned back with a loud voice
[10:26] and glorified God and fell down on his
[10:29] face on his feet giving him thanks and
[10:33] he was a Samaritan and Jesus answering
[10:37] said were not were not ten cleansed but
[10:45] where are the nine there are not found
[10:50] that returned to give glory to God save
[10:54] the stranger and he said unto Him arise
[10:58] and go thy way the faith has made the
[11:04] whole
[11:06] let's pray this evening may be of a need
[11:08] and I know there's a lot of sickness
[11:10] that has went through and let's just
[11:12] pray that God would just touch our lives
[11:14] this afternoon amen
[11:16] Almighty God you see our hands all over
[11:19] this building and many great needs has
[11:21] already been read across this audience
[11:24] tonight I ask you that you would send
[11:26] your word and heal Lord I believe that
[11:29] you can come to a Pew I remember sitting
[11:32] in a pew many years ago when you came
[11:34] and heal my lungs while I sit and listen
[11:37] to the Word of God you're the same God
[11:40] tonight I asked her tonight that you
[11:42] would anoint the words that we have
[11:44] studied this week and prepared I ask you
[11:47] that you would anoint this audience we
[11:49] thank you for what you did here last
[11:50] night and Lord what you've done today
[11:53] and tomorrow Lord and minister to our
[11:55] hearts we pray in Jesus Christ's name we
[11:58] pray a man and a man and a man you may
[12:01] be seated
[12:02] I found the statement pretty interesting
[12:10] this week a man named Winston Churchill
[12:14] stood and he was given a speech and he
[12:16] says you have enemies good that means
[12:24] that you stood up for something some
[12:28] time in your life it's quite a statement
[12:31] in it Thanksgiving is an American
[12:36] holiday Canadian as well they have
[12:38] there's a little bit earlier than we do
[12:41] it's an American holidays by for us is
[12:44] here and we sure to enjoy it it's a time
[12:50] to stop and give thanks for what he's
[12:52] done for us over the year that we have
[12:56] had in our audience we've had some
[12:59] pretty incredible things that have taken
[13:00] place births of babies that have
[13:03] happened we've had some to go on to be
[13:06] with the Lord and and in in in that
[13:09] sometimes we go well that was a great
[13:11] loss to us but we must remember that's
[13:15] not goodbye
[13:19] it is only a temporary separation
[13:22] because God provided them a new body
[13:25] that they could step into men like
[13:29] brother Ralph and brother Ted Hensley
[13:31] went to be with the Lord this year and
[13:33] and they stepped from this realm to that
[13:35] drill man and God rich in His mercy
[13:39] would come and begin to heal our hearts
[13:41] and touch us as an audience we've got
[13:45] new faces that are among us brother
[13:48] John's sons that have came to be with us
[13:50] and God's blessed them to be here and we
[13:53] we welcome them as as a part of our body
[13:57] amen were functioning body and all of us
[14:00] have different things and different
[14:02] gifts in our lives and and if you're new
[14:05] here we'd like to say welcome and thank
[14:07] you for being here and so we come into
[14:09] this Thanksgiving season we we just
[14:11] thank God for what he's done there's new
[14:14] homes that have been built new cars that
[14:17] are being driven we've went through some
[14:20] some heartaches and we've we've had some
[14:23] tests in their lives we've seen new jobs
[14:26] take place we've got teachers that have
[14:28] taken spots and and Lawyer this taking
[14:31] spots and jobs has been given families
[14:34] have been touched and and and we must we
[14:38] must stop and thank God for everything
[14:43] you know sometimes we will allow things
[14:46] to happen and things go on in their
[14:48] lives and if we're not careful God would
[14:51] do incredible things and in his and
[14:55] incredible things that he does if we're
[14:57] not careful we'll take it for granted or
[15:00] feel like we're entitled to it or he
[15:04] with me but without God we wouldn't have
[15:06] the oxygen to breathe without God the
[15:12] even the abilities in our life that he
[15:15] has given us in a natural room we
[15:17] wouldn't have the strength to do for us
[15:21] we've we've welcomed brother Greg's
[15:25] family here to be a part of us and they
[15:27] have moved and moved into the schools
[15:30] system and jobs has taken place as I was
[15:34] preparing and looking over this the last
[15:36] couple of weeks I I thought about an
[15:38] event that kind of from which I give
[15:42] great things for I think it was on May
[15:46] the 11th if I've got my date right maybe
[15:49] don't have it right but I I put it on
[15:51] the calendar on May the 11th
[15:53] I I got up with a very uneasy feeling
[15:56] and I just felt like tragedy was just
[15:59] right in front of me and and it just
[16:02] felt like you ever wake up with the
[16:04] moment maybe it's never happened to you
[16:06] but you just you just know that troubles
[16:08] headed your way and you don't know what
[16:10] to do about her what to think about it
[16:12] and I was Saturday and I was preparing
[16:15] to speak and and as I was as I was
[16:19] preparing to speak I I just wrote it
[16:21] down before service that tragedy was
[16:25] right in front of us and I wrote it down
[16:28] and I'm just praying that God will
[16:30] divert that tragedy and whenever I have
[16:34] a vision or have a dream of significance
[16:37] or something like that I'll give sister
[16:39] Connie I'll write it down I'll give
[16:41] sister Connie that it would be a
[16:43] two-fold witness that it will take place
[16:45] and so I give sister Connie that note
[16:49] and actually gave it to her before
[16:50] service and that as it would be that she
[16:55] would take that note and if you remember
[16:57] she had some candies for the children I
[16:59] believe after service and and I was
[17:02] finishing the service and just something
[17:04] came to me as I was finishing the
[17:07] service I stepped out and I said I want
[17:10] to have prayer of her that note and I
[17:12] told sister Connie to bring it and she
[17:15] actually had to go get her pocketbook
[17:16] somewhere another she brought it down
[17:18] and you know we it would seem like
[17:20] sometimes you feel like at the end of
[17:22] the service well what are you holding
[17:24] for a few extra moments well sometimes
[17:26] those extra moments take
[17:29] their real price has just set real still
[17:31] for just a few moments it'll be alright
[17:33] and so so anyway we brought the note
[17:38] down and I prayed for that note I didn't
[17:40] tell you what was on that note but I
[17:43] prayed over that note and because you
[17:45] know I can't have you anxious as well as
[17:48] me but I placed it into the hands of a
[17:50] God that that that had tomorrow on his
[17:54] mind now you know we're thankful for
[17:58] what he has done here's where I'm going
[18:01] with this tonight we're thankful for
[18:03] what he has done but little do we
[18:05] sometimes appreciate that he's paving
[18:08] the way for tomorrow he's already got
[18:15] your tomorrow mapped out and he's making
[18:20] a way for you and so just within matter
[18:27] of a day brother Jason was working in a
[18:29] about a 20 foot ditch in a 20 foot deep
[18:32] hole in a concrete bunker and and he's
[18:35] there and he's at the bottom and he's
[18:38] doing I don't understand the work and
[18:40] I'm just gonna do the best that I can
[18:41] and he's and he's concreting a pipe
[18:44] together if I'm right and just something
[18:47] moves on him to get out and get new
[18:49] concrete and he said literally within
[18:52] seconds of being out of the hole down
[18:56] the down the the pipe stream a man
[19:00] busted a huge line and that huge hole
[19:06] that he was working in 20 foot deep was
[19:11] now gushing with water that's something
[19:17] that caused him to get out of that hole
[19:24] that's something that's something that
[19:29] you can't explain that warm presence
[19:33] that comes in your room and you just
[19:35] know I'm not alone no more
[19:40] you just know that something's got ahold
[19:42] of my life and and I'm not the only one
[19:45] here you can't explain it you can't
[19:48] define it you just know that God's
[19:52] watching over the seed so in turn we
[19:59] didn't have a funeral here but we can
[20:05] have a family Thanksgiving
[20:16] hallelujah I'm really grateful for that
[20:27] you don't know how many times I've
[20:29] looked at that note hey man maybe I need
[20:33] to send you a copy of that you can have
[20:36] that and hold it away somewhere I'm a
[20:40] little bit sentimental along those lines
[20:42] those things mean a lot to me
[20:45] brother William and sister Gabrielle
[20:48] moved here I believe two years ago or
[20:50] year and a half ago she's with child
[20:54] they're building up a beautiful home for
[20:58] those of you that drive 340 and you see
[21:00] this this house going up
[21:03] I don't know particularly what they
[21:06] lived in in Alabama was that Alabama I
[21:11] don't know what you lived in in Alabama
[21:13] but I believe that's a step up that's a
[21:19] really nice piece of property and we
[21:24] know that's just God's blessings on your
[21:27] life and for that week thanks give God
[21:31] thanks sister Gabrielle's father came to
[21:36] the Lord just just weeks before the
[21:39] meeting and and I witnessed sister
[21:42] Gabrielle hugging her father something
[21:45] that been a long time coming and then I
[21:49] was sent a picture this last week of her
[21:51] brother sitting in the seat with her
[21:54] father and that's been a long time
[21:56] coming
[21:58] won't you just stop for just a moment
[22:00] and say thank you God for your blessings
[22:03] on me
[22:09] hallelujah could you just now just stop
[22:13] for a second and say father I want to
[22:15] thank you this would be a different
[22:18] service but I want to thank you I'd like
[22:22] to be the one that the other nine they
[22:26] got healed and they just went their own
[22:28] way and took it for granted but I'd like
[22:30] to be the one to return to bow at your
[22:35] feet and say thank you this nation was
[22:48] founded and somewhere around 1620 I I've
[22:54] looked at a couple of different things
[22:56] could be 16 20 21 but a man named
[23:00] William Bradford is the man that gets
[23:02] credit for celebrating the first
[23:05] Thanksgiving at Plymouth Rock they came
[23:09] to America or this new land bringing a
[23:13] hundred and two people to to come and
[23:16] settle a village and make it like Europe
[23:19] and have streets and houses like there
[23:20] was in Europe there was others that had
[23:23] already came after one year 47 of their
[23:28] brothers and sisters had died ending
[23:31] wars sicknesses and plagues and
[23:33] situations accidents had happened and
[23:36] now 47 of their own brethren have died
[23:41] but God prepared something well before
[23:44] that they would even be in this
[23:46] situation only a few years before there
[23:50] there was a man an Indian boy named
[23:52] Squanto that was taken capture as a boy
[23:56] because they had preparations that they
[23:59] needed an interpreter and so they had
[24:01] taught him English and then they took
[24:03] him to Europe and he became a master at
[24:06] speaking English and into his mastery of
[24:09] speaking English he they sent him back
[24:13] to America to be able to solve some
[24:15] situations and he went back to his
[24:18] own land to where he was at into his own
[24:20] village and and they heard that there
[24:23] was a new village that was not doing
[24:25] well and and they'd had some Wars and he
[24:29] went to this village meeting a man named
[24:31] William Bradford and he began to speak
[24:33] with him being eloquent in English as an
[24:36] as an Indian boy he brought peace
[24:40] he brought a a peace treaty between the
[24:45] white man and the Indians that lasted 50
[24:48] years I like fur cool Squanto to go to
[24:52] Washington today I'd really like for
[24:57] that to go to Washington today and he
[24:59] could and he could settle some things I
[25:01] think people need some of that in their
[25:03] own families but Squanto had become a
[25:07] Christian and even been a Christian he
[25:12] became a peacemaker and he went to this
[25:15] residue of people that had died and
[25:19] people that had been buried their dead
[25:21] and now hundred and two it came 47 had
[25:25] perished and he began to teach them
[25:27] about how to raise corn and how to plant
[25:30] in how to use fish for fertilizer and he
[25:33] began to teach them and and then the
[25:35] year would pass in the next year they
[25:37] got a bountiful crop and William
[25:40] Bradford said we need to stop and thank
[25:42] God for what he's done for us now you
[25:47] see God provided them before they ever
[25:51] landed in America he provided them a boy
[25:57] that would become a Christian now this
[26:02] boy would would suffer hardship he would
[26:04] die the year later in 1622 as a boy an
[26:09] injury that would take place fever would
[26:12] happen in Hindman and he would perish
[26:14] but in his young life whether you have
[26:18] ever heard his name or not
[26:19] hem he's ever heard the name Squanto
[26:22] teachers and children all over the
[26:24] building raising their hands and making
[26:26] me look like a nut
[26:28] but squee would have no flag if it
[26:32] wasn't for a guy like this but a God
[26:36] prepared him because he was watching
[26:39] over his seat and you said well what
[26:42] does this have to do with the message of
[26:44] an hour sermon let me just say this
[26:47] nation was going to have a prophet in it
[26:51] he was going to send the seventh angel
[26:54] to this nation and we would need to be
[26:57] birthed and to be born and to raise up
[27:01] as to thank God thank God and remember
[27:06] it's God that has established us that's
[27:10] when a nation fails when she forgets who
[27:14] God is and they gathered their there
[27:22] they gathered their fruit and they and
[27:25] that first that first year
[27:27] William Bradford gave each one their
[27:30] five seeds of corn as a remembrance of
[27:35] where they had came from I think
[27:38] sometimes that's something we ought to
[27:39] do as our own thoughts
[27:41] remember what we came from I'm not out
[27:48] of line here Psalms 100 we spoke last
[27:51] week and the scripture said make a
[27:54] joyful noise unto the Lord all you lands
[27:57] serve the Lord with gladness come before
[28:02] his presence with singing and know ye
[28:05] that the Lord he is God and four-hit is
[28:08] he that hath made us and not we
[28:10] ourselves I think that's something we
[28:13] always ought to remember not we
[28:15] ourselves we are his people and sheep of
[28:20] his pasture enter into his gates with
[28:23] Thanksgiving so Thanksgiving is every
[28:28] service
[28:29] and into his courts with praise and be
[28:33] thankful unto Him and bless his name for
[28:37] the Lord is good his mercy is
[28:42] everlasting it is truth endure through
[28:44] all generations Colossians chapter 3 and
[28:49] verse 12 says put on therefore as the
[28:52] elect of God holy and beloved bowels of
[28:55] mercies and kindness and humbleness of
[28:58] mind meekness and long-suffering
[29:00] forbearing one another forgiving one
[29:05] another forgiveness will heal you if any
[29:11] man have a quarrel against even if any
[29:13] even as Christ forgave you so also do
[29:17] you as a Christian you must understand
[29:21] problems are going to come but then it's
[29:24] your opportunity to practice forgiveness
[29:27] verse 14 and above all these things put

[29:33] perfectness and let the peace of God

[34:04] that you're in the time with your family
[34:06] that you've got an opportunity to be
[34:08] with thank God for that moment whew a
[34:16] few months ago I preached to you brother
[34:18] Branham who said he said if I had the
[34:21] opportunity if I had a room completely
[34:23] full of gold
[34:24] I would exchange that for an hour with
[34:29] my daddy his daddy's done went on but I
[34:36] would exchange all of that with an hour
[34:39] with my daddy I understand that I
[34:44] understand that I get to missing my
[34:47] father and I get to missing brother
[34:48] Homer and there's days that I just get

[35:32] happen most that not ourself of tomorrow
[35:38] for thou knowest not a day may bring
[35:44] forth now here's a powerful statement
[35:52] let another man praise thee and not
[35:57] thine own mouth
[36:01] boy that could be read to Laodicea that
[36:06] could be read to lay out a seal this
[36:08] self-seeking age that everything's about
[36:13] themselves let another man praise thee
[36:21] and not thine own mouth a stranger and
[36:25] not thine own lips a stone is heavy in a
[36:29] sand weighty but a fools wrath is
[36:33] heavier than them both I'd like to say
[36:48] I'm thankful for Jesus Christ I don't
[36:56] know about you but he changed my life I
[37:01] was asked this afternoon how - what do
[37:04] we define an experience by and my reply
[37:08] was how do we define an experience how
[37:12] do we tell somebody else our experience
[37:15] how do we illustrate it to somebody else
[37:17] how do we can it how do we preserve it
[37:19] how do we bring somebody else into our
[37:22] experience all I know is it's when it
[37:26] happened to me in a few moments I went
[37:29] from one person to another all I know is
[37:36] in this moment I was this way and when
[37:40] he came when I came on the other side of
[37:43] that moment I was this way I know this
[37:49] when I took Andrew to British Columbia
[37:51] Andrew was a certain way in his life but
[37:57] when we brought him home he was a
[37:59] complete different boy
[38:03] are you with me in the same weekend
[38:07] brother joel ray was a certain way when
[38:09] he came to that meeting but when he went
[38:11] home he was a complete different boy
[38:14] same Jesus and all I know is before
[38:20] before Jesus came into my life I was a
[38:24] wreck I was like a lot of you I was a
[38:29] wreck and I thank God that he came and
[38:37] changed my lives my father listens to
[38:46] tapes every every every morning every
[38:49] afternoon and every night it's his thing
[38:53] to do he gets up in the morning at 6
[38:55] o'clock and turns on the tape recorder I
[38:58] don't stay there when reason being at 6
[39:02] o'clock in the morning brother branham
[39:04] sounding on a bullhorn I'm just not
[39:07] ready for it quite yet and it's lovely
[39:12] he's got used to doing it and he's alone
[39:15] so he turns on brother branham and and
[39:17] he catches some of it because most times
[39:21] when I call him I'm waking him up and
[39:27] I'll ask him I said what do you get it
[39:29] what did you get out of the tape because
[39:33] if not careful you'll you'll listen to a
[39:36] sermon or listen to a tape an and will
[39:40] go well I've heard that one before I've
[39:42] heard the rapture I've heard it 50 times
[39:45] or a hundred times or 102 but what did
[39:48] you get today and so when he tells me
[39:51] what I just listened to kind of like
[39:53] what parents do how was your day
[39:55] what did you what was he taught what did
[39:58] you eat for lunch and I simply trying to
[40:01] keep dad's mind young and stirred I
[40:03] asked him I said well what did you hear
[40:05] well I heard I heard things that are to
[40:07] be what did God speak to you today that
[40:10] you caught and he
[40:12] to tell me a couple of different
[40:13] sentences that became alive to him I
[40:17] think if we ever get to the spot to
[40:20] where we walk in this church and we sat
[40:22] down and we hear the songs and when we
[40:24] listen to the ministry and we don't get
[40:26] anything it means that we wasn't ready
[40:31] and it's not the singers and it's not
[40:34] the preachers fault
[40:36] and it's definitely not God's fault
[40:39] but I want to be ready I read this to
[40:49] you some time ago and I want to read it
[40:51] again because it just meant so much to
[40:53] me this week when I begin to think about
[40:55] what a change that he made in my life
[40:59] what a change this message has made in
[41:02] my life I heard this when I was in
[41:07] Germany from a brother from South Africa
[41:09] and eroded him and got this from him and
[41:14] he said he came from the bosom of the
[41:16] Father to the bosom of a woman he put on
[41:21] humanity that we might put on divinity
[41:25] he became a son of man that we might
[41:28] become sense of God he came from heaven
[41:31] where rivers never freeze winds never
[41:35] blow frost never chills the air flowers
[41:39] never fade and no one has ever sick
[41:43] there's no Undertaker's and there's no
[41:46] graveyards and no one ever dies and no
[41:50] one is ever buried he is born contrary
[41:55] to the laws of nature he lived in
[41:57] poverty he was reared in obscurity he
[42:00] crossed the boundary of land once in
[42:03] childhood and he had no wealth nor
[42:05] influence neither training nor formal
[42:08] education his relatives were
[42:10] inconspicuous and influential in infancy
[42:15] he startled the king and boy hid he
[42:19] puzzled wise men and land hood he ruled
[42:23] the course of nature he walked up on
[42:25] bull bellows in hutch the seat asleep
[42:28] He healed multitudes without medicine
[42:31] and made no charge for his services he
[42:33] never wrote a book yet all the libraries
[42:36] of the country could not hold the books
[42:38] that were been written about him he
[42:41] never sent wrote a song yet he furnished
[42:44] the theme of more songs than all the
[42:48] songwriters combined he never found at a
[42:52] college yet all schools together cannot
[42:55] boast of as many students as he has he
[43:00] never practiced psychology psychiatry
[43:03] psychiatry and yet he healed more broken
[43:06] hearts then doctors have healed broken
[43:11] bodies he never marshaled alarming
[43:16] drafted a soldier fired a gun yet no
[43:20] leader has had more volunteers who have
[43:25] under his orders made rebel stack arms
[43:28] of surrender without a shot being fired
[43:31] he is the star of astronomy the rock of
[43:35] geology the line and that and the lamb
[43:38] of zoology he is the harmonizer of all
[43:40] discord Zinn the healer of all diseases
[43:43] great men have come and gone yet
[43:46] the lives of on Herod could not kill him
[43:49] Satan could not seduce him death could
[43:52] not destroy him the grave could not hold
[43:55] him he laid aside purple robes of
[43:59] royalty for a peasant's down he was rich
[44:01] yet for our sake became poor ask the
[44:10] wise men he slept in another man's
[44:12] manger he cruised the lake in in in
[44:16] another man's boat he rode on another
[44:20] man's donkey he was buried in another
[44:23] man's poo
[44:28] all men have failed but he never failed
[44:35] he is known as the perfect one
[44:38] he is the chief among 10,000 he is the
[44:42] wonderful and the merciful and he is my
[44:46] Savior he is incomparable I call him God
[44:57] Philippians 2 and verse 7 said but he
[44:59] made of himself a no reputation and he
[45:02] took upon him the form of a servant he
[45:04] was made a likeness of man and being
[45:07] found in a fashion as a man he humbled
[45:09] himself and became obedient unto death
[45:12] even the death of the cross
[45:15] wherefore God hath also highly exalted
[45:18] him and give him a name which is above
[45:21] every name that at the name of Jesus
[45:24] every knee should bow of things in
[45:27] heaven and things in earth and things
[45:29] under the earth and that every tongue
[45:31] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[45:35] to the glory of God the Father I would
[45:44] like to say he's incomparable in his
[45:46] love in Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 2
[45:50] and walk in love as Christ hath loved us
[45:55] and had given himself for us an offering
[45:58] in the sacrifice to God for a
[46:01] sweet-smelling Savior no one ever had
[46:05] grace like he did no one forgive me
[46:11] nobody had grace like he had second
[46:14] Corinthians chapter 8 in verse 9 for you
[46:17] know that the grace of our Lord Jesus
[46:19] Christ that though he was rich yet for
[46:24] your sakes
[46:31] he became poor they get through his
[46:37] private REE became rich sacrifice as
[46:49] Andrew preached last night for even the
[46:55] Son of man came not to be ministered
[46:56] unto but to minister and to give his
[47:03] life a ransom for many brother on that's
[47:11] old news really because you can't pay
[47:13] for your own sins his power I'd like to
[47:22] say to you tonight it's incomparable
[47:29] Jesus would say it all power is given
[47:32] unto me in heaven and in earth I'd like
[47:40] to say this to you even when he held his
[47:43] peace his quietness was powerful when
[47:57] Kings asked him to show him a miracle he
[48:00] refused to clown for him when he was
[48:03] standing there he knew who he was he
[48:06] know what he was sent to do and yet he
[48:10] would say my kingdom is not of this
[48:11] world he could have called ten thousand
[48:15] angels but because of you because of me
[48:22] he held himself yet we live in a nation
[48:29] that says I don't need God we live in a
[48:33] nation where the Ten Commandments is no
[48:35] longer welcome in our judicial system or
[48:37] in our school
[48:40] and we rant and rave about that but what
[48:43] about your home are you with me we can
[48:48] be political and say we need prayer back
[48:51] in schools and prayer back in churches
[48:53] prayer back in this when I go home what
[48:56] about your life what about your
[49:00] dedication be there feel thankful first
[49:15] timothy verse 6 and verse 13 i give the
[49:19] charge in the sight of God who
[49:21] quickeneth all things and for Christ
[49:24] Jesus is standing for for Pontius Pilate
[49:27] witnessed a good confession that thou
[49:31] keep this commandment without spot
[49:34] unreviewable under the appearing of the
[49:37] Lord Jesus Christ which in his times he
[49:42] shall show who is the blessed and the
[49:46] only Payton potentate king of kings and
[49:49] Lord of lords oh yeah I shared this with
[49:57] some friends this week and I share it
[49:59] with you thinking about Thanksgiving
[50:03] there's a person that I have that I have
[50:06] admired in my Christian experience
[50:09] through the decades that I've served the
[50:11] Lord and that was a person named Corey
[50:14] Tim boom
[50:16] she was an individual that was her they
[50:20] were actually became the Underground
[50:23] Railroad of of Europe to be able to try
[50:26] to rescue as many Jews as they could
[50:28] rescue and they did by the tens of
[50:30] thousands and to get them to safety and
[50:33] then they were arrested and taken to the
[50:36] to the to the concentration camps and in
[50:42] those horrible concentration camps she
[50:45] would lose her father and
[50:48] she would have to stand and watch her
[50:49] sister be destroyed she would give
[50:57] testimony she would be a pauper here in
[50:59] America she would be used by Billy
[51:02] Graham and other great evangelists as a
[51:04] testimony of the saving grace of Jesus
[51:07] Christ and the power of forgiveness and
[51:09] she said that one thing that caused her
[51:12] to be able to survive the concentration
[51:15] camps was daily forgiveness in her
[51:26] eighties she had never owned a home but
[51:29] she was given a new home a very nice
[51:32] home in California they gave her a
[51:36] Holman and a young preacher was there to
[51:39] visit with her and and he began to talk
[51:42] to this elderly lady and he began to
[51:44] talk to her about how good God's been to
[51:47] you lately how good God's been to you
[51:50] now that he's given you a home and she
[51:53] stopped him short seeing his ignorance
[51:56] and his shortsightedness and she said
[52:01] Sonny Boy God was good to me in the
[52:05] concentration camps he's always been
[52:13] good to me
[52:29] at this point I want to say this to you
[52:32] I'm walking on ledge that doctors told
[52:35] me I would never walk anymore I was hit
[52:38] by lightning things could have turned
[52:41] out different to different strokes one
[52:46] would land me in a hospital for eight
[52:48] days and couldn't see the turn to the
[52:50] light but on the eighth day I led a
[52:54] nurse to the Lord Jesus Christ and after
[52:56] leading that nurse to the Lord Jesus
[52:58] Christ God healed my body and it was as
[53:03] though it never happened in the first
[53:04] place are you with me but the Kelly was
[53:11] visiting with us three years ago I had a
[53:13] heart attack the day brother Kelly was
[53:16] to arrive it took me to the hospital I
[53:19] was working I was working at the local
[53:21] recycle center with my boys and we were
[53:24] working and all the sudden it struck me
[53:26] I've never really been scared of
[53:29] anything in my life but I really want to
[53:31] say goodbye when it comes and all I knew
[53:35] that the pain in my chest that was
[53:37] happening I was not in control of and
[53:41] there was seemed to be a something that
[53:45] was coming over top of me as a young
[53:47] Mexican boy named Carlos that his kin to
[53:50] our sister back here and he quickly
[53:52] began to work on me and get me in his
[53:54] car and Matthew and them carried me to
[53:57] the car and and for the first time I
[54:01] life I felt that I felt the fear that
[54:03] went with it but I kept reminding myself
[54:07] that everything's going to be all right
[54:09] but the Kelly would come that night
[54:12] somewhere around 11 o'clock one of the
[54:13] boys went and picked them up and from
[54:15] the airport and picked them up and and I
[54:19] went to the I went to the I did a stress
[54:22] test the next morning and and and failed
[54:25] the stress test but I talked the doctors
[54:28] into letting me go home
[54:29] and so because I didn't want to stay I
[54:33] wanted to be here for the meeting and
[54:37] then and then we would go away for
[54:39] couple of days for brother Kelly and
[54:41] enjoy some company together and there's
[54:43] all kinds of things that was going on
[54:45] but somewhere between December the 6th
[54:48] and December around the 29th and went to
[54:51] dr. Luna and dr. Luna looked at all the
[54:53] tests and reruns some deaths and he said
[54:57] it's over he said there's no damage from
[55:00] what took place things could have been
[55:04] different things could have been
[55:08] different a fire took place and things
[55:11] could have been different
[55:13] they could have harvest my organs for
[55:18] this church things could have been a lot
[55:21] different I'd like to take a moment here
[55:23] when we think about when brother Timothy
[55:25] Pruett came and he talked about this
[55:27] audience and he was in the barn and told
[55:30] his daddy to come and daddy came and
[55:33] preached preach to services on God will
[55:35] have a testimony and God's Hall of Fame
[55:39] listen let me just say this to you God
[55:41] watched over us and prepared us I squat
[55:46] to God watched over our lives
[55:49] you see he's ahead of us God don't know
[55:55] time but he's ahead of us making a way
[55:57] for us seeing that I would need to be
[56:00] here tonight I needed to survive that
[56:04] brother Bisco would be anointed on my
[56:08] worst day in the coma to where doctors
[56:11] gave me up anointed to tell that I would
[56:14] be the speaker next year in the camp the
[56:18] speaker in the camp so I would survive
[56:21] and be the speaker so we get things
[56:32] Corey Tim Tim Boone says I'd like to
[56:35] give you five quotations many but these
[56:38] five spoke to me are you okay I know
[56:43] this is different tonight but I think
[56:45] it's very I think it's been beneficial
[56:47] to me this week and I feel it's
[56:49] beneficial to you you can never learn
[56:53] that Christ is all you need until Christ
[56:59] is all you have do you know what hurts
[57:12] so much so very much it's love love is
[57:18] the strongest force in the world and
[57:21] when it is blocked that means pain there
[57:25] are two things that we can do when this
[57:28] happens we can kill that love so that it
[57:32] stops hurting but then of course part of
[57:36] us dies too or we can ask God to open up
[57:40] another route for love to travel through
[57:48] she says today I know that so memories
[57:54] such memories are the key not to the
[57:58] past but to the future I know that
[58:01] experiences of our lives when we let God
[58:04] use them become mysterious and perfect
[58:08] preparation for the work that he will
[58:11] give us to do maybe our teachers would
[58:14] enjoy these quotations to be kept
[58:21] father in heaven knows when we're going
[58:25] to need things - I found this one
[58:31] incredible our wise father knows in
[58:35] heaven knows when we're going to need
[58:37] things do but don't get ahead of him
[58:51] love is larger than walls which shut it
[58:56] in even as angry vengeful thoughts ball
[59:04] through me and I thought of a woman in
[59:07] the concentration camp she could say
[59:09] some powerful words with this even as
[59:12] angry vengeful thoughts ball through me
[59:15] I saw the sin of them Jesus Christ died
[59:19] for this man was I going to ask for more
[59:23] Lord Jesus I prayed forgive me help me
[59:26] to forgive him Jesus I cannot forgive
[59:29] him give me your forgiveness and so I
[59:32] discovered that it's not on our
[59:35] forgiveness anymore
[59:36] then on on our for goodness that the
[59:39] world's healing hinges but on his when
[59:43] he tells us to love our enemies he gives
[59:47] along with the command the very love
[59:49] itself this is a good one if the devil
[59:58] cannot make us bad he will make us busy
[1:00:09] don't bother to give God instructions
[1:00:12] just report for duty put this one on
[1:00:17] your refrigerator for tomorrow don't
[1:00:20] bother to give God instructions just
[1:00:24] report further there I'll give you this
[1:00:35] last one there's several more then I'll
[1:00:37] give you this last one hold everything
[1:00:39] in your hands lightly otherwise it hurts
[1:00:44] when God price your fingers open that
[1:00:52] one that one I gave great thought to
[1:00:55] this week when Jesus was standing at
[1:01:00] last as his tomb he says something that
[1:01:04] all of us know that Jesus said Lazarus
[1:01:07] come forth but I want to read to you the
[1:01:11] prayer that he prays and then they took
[1:01:15] away the stone from the place were the
[1:01:17] Dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his
[1:01:21] eyes notice these words and said father
[1:01:26] I thank thee that thou has heard me I
[1:01:34] thank you that you heard my prayer I
[1:01:39] think that would do us really good due
[1:01:41] diligence tonight I thank you that you
[1:01:46] heard my prayer but the brain says this
[1:01:53] he came by writing a lot of people said
[1:01:56] he's a healer all we've seen him open up
[1:02:00] the eyes of the blind we see him make
[1:02:01] the crippled walk we see him off for
[1:02:04] prayer and fever left the child but then
[1:02:08] those type were only following him for
[1:02:10] the loaves and the fishes
[1:02:12] and that's the way the crowds are today
[1:02:14] many if if there's a healer while
[1:02:17] they'll follow him he he's just in a way
[1:02:20] ASIS if they get sick they run and say
[1:02:23] oh oh will you please pray for me and
[1:02:27] the Lord Jesus will make them me well
[1:02:31] and as soon as they came out of the
[1:02:35] hospital or the spit bed right back to
[1:02:38] the world they'd go I'd like to bring
[1:02:42] that that quote to live to you
[1:02:45] when brother Holman was here there were
[1:02:50] a lot of people and brother Holman was a
[1:02:52] general but there was a lot of people
[1:02:55] when they got in trouble would run their
[1:02:57] brother Homer they didn't serve the Lord
[1:02:58] they'd come a few services in him gone
[1:03:01] when they got in trouble they'd come a
[1:03:03] few services and gone high up in a
[1:03:05] pastor a while now and if they didn't
[1:03:09] dad or they were way and run and and
[1:03:11] needed money they'd come to the Homer
[1:03:13] and brother home around the goodness of
[1:03:14] his heart would give them money and they
[1:03:16] was they would serve the Lord you know
[1:03:18] for a little flaw and then they were
[1:03:19] gone and after brother home and left the
[1:03:23] scene they came to me and I said that
[1:03:33] won't give you salvation
[1:03:36] and I saw your tricks for years I won't
[1:03:41] be here for you Jesus will always be him
[1:03:51] well Homer will get rewarded for all the
[1:03:54] great deeds that he did but those people
[1:03:58] were only using the gift and the man and
[1:04:02] not seeking for the eternal value don't
[1:04:06] let that be your case don't let that be
[1:04:11] in your case that might be a little bit
[1:04:23] strong but you might as well hear you
[1:04:30] might as well hear it you might as well
[1:04:33] know it I can't save you I can't pay all
[1:04:38] your debts but Jesus can fix your
[1:04:42] problems if you can get to Jesus not to
[1:04:48] the preacher I've heard all brother
[1:04:59] Harlow was here Jesus is here
[1:05:07] one day there will be a statement made
[1:05:09] all brother on was here but Jesus would
[1:05:12] still be here and after the rapture
[1:05:15] there's going to be people screaming off
[1:05:17] they were all here come on you can just
[1:05:21] reach with me now I'll relax and preach
[1:05:22] with me when the bride leaves you're
[1:05:26] going to want us to be here and in that
[1:05:33] day you're gonna say how wish shall I
[1:05:35] serve God with everything that was
[1:05:37] within me and I got rid of those things
[1:05:39] that kept me I don't really serving the
[1:05:43] Lord you're talking about real
[1:05:45] repentance
[1:05:49] why aren't they open the doors why
[1:05:52] aren't they here well what they have
[1:05:54] been preaching about changed their body
[1:05:56] and all what a face stiffened that's

[1:20:17] wrong thing unintentionally you're the
[1:20:24] walking billboard for the wrong thing
[1:20:27] when you come to the realization this
[1:20:31] ain't going to be this way in heaven so
[1:20:35] I've been acquitted here
[1:20:40] if it ain't gonna be eternal I gotta
[1:20:43] quit it here
[1:20:53] whether it's hate or prejudice maybe
[1:21:01] it's just a priority of time of usurping
[1:21:03] God serving God is more than about it's
[1:21:07] the right recipe the thing to do it's
[1:21:10] about him living on the inside of you
[1:21:12] and he's the king of your heart he's the
[1:21:16] king of your heart
[1:21:24] maybe it's your dress and you said well
[1:21:32] brother on those things are difficult
[1:21:34] for me to give up for brother Kelly's
[1:21:38] mother it was her earrings was difficult
[1:21:41] but the Kelly will come and preach to
[1:21:43] you next week and he's going to wear a
[1:21:46] pin most likely he's been here the last
[1:21:49] couple of years in his opinion that will
[1:21:50] be there right there and that's made out
[1:21:54] of an ear ring his mother's ear ring and
[1:22:03] she held her ears the last time that I
[1:22:05] was there just before God did a work in
[1:22:08] her life and she said this is one thing
[1:22:10] I'll never give up and I just looked at
[1:22:12] her and I said I want to ask you
[1:22:16] something what earrings be so big would
[1:22:21] that be the one excuse that you would
[1:22:23] have to miss eternal love maybe it's not
[1:22:31] earrings for you to not what's that
[1:22:35] little thing oh what a Thanksgiving it
[1:22:41] would be if you could
[1:22:50] but that one thing I'm not gonna ask you
[1:22:55] to raise your hand but you were raised
[1:22:57] in a home with parents that were dealing
[1:23:01] with difficulties and they just that one
[1:23:03] thing if they could ever get across that
[1:23:05] hurdle you you would think that they
[1:23:08] would be much better off how many of you
[1:23:11] were raised in that kind of an
[1:23:12] atmosphere just that one thing then what
[1:23:17] about you in that amazing how quick that
[1:23:20] thing comes home to you by pointing the
