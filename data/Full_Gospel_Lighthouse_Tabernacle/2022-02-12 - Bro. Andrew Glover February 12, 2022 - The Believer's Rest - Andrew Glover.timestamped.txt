[28:11] father lord you said that there'd be a
[28:13] famine in the end time
[28:15] and not just a family lord for food and
[28:17] water but a famine of the truth and men
[28:19] would run to and fro looking for the
[28:21] truth and here we have lord an open book
[28:23] a full message lord that was given to us
[28:26] or that was restored all the power back
[28:28] to the church and lord we come father

[28:57] anything above we're able to even ask or
[28:59] think lord more than what we can desire
[29:02] something we can desire something so
[29:04] much but lord you desire to give it to
[29:06] us more than we desire to have it
[29:08] lord many times it's hard for our carnal
[29:10] minds to understand that the lord we
[29:12] believe it and lord your presence is
[29:14] here father your presence is here with
[29:17] such great pressure lord and

[59:26] honor and all the glory for it's in the
[59:28] wonderful name of our lord and savior
[59:30] jesus christ we pray and all the
[59:32] believer says
[59:34] amen and amen psalms 34
[59:37] and verse number eight you love the lord
[59:39] this evening
[59:41] amen the bible here
[59:42] says old taste and see
[59:45] that the lord
[59:46] is good
[59:48] i love this part blessed is the man
[59:51] that trusteth in him
[59:53] taste and see that the lord is good
[59:56] blessed is the man that trusteth in him
[1:00:00] now we didn't know until a prophet come
[1:00:02] that there was actually another portion
[1:00:04] of the scripture and it's found in
[1:00:06] matthew 11 chapter if we could look
[1:00:07] there in matthew 11
[1:00:10] amen blessed is the man that trusteth in
[1:00:12] the lord how many people here tonight
[1:00:14] trust in the lord
[1:00:16] amen matthew the 11th chapter
[1:00:18] and then the 28th verse
[1:00:21] this this is the blessing
[1:00:23] of psalms 34 and verse 8. matthew 11 28
[1:00:28] come unto me all ye
[1:00:29] that labor
[1:00:30] and are heavy laden
[1:00:32] and i
[1:00:33] will give you rest
[1:00:35] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[1:00:38] for i am meek and lowly in heart notice
[1:00:42] this and you shall find rest unto your
[1:00:45] souls now what stands out to me there is
[1:00:47] out of the three-part being that we are
[1:00:49] body spirit and soul
[1:00:51] that he specifically identifies the
[1:00:53] place this rest is coming to
[1:00:55] you shall find rest unto your souls for
[1:00:58] my yoke is easy and my burden is light
[1:01:02] amen we ask the lord this evening to add
[1:01:04] the blessing to the reading of his word
[1:01:06] as you can be seated here this afternoon
[1:01:07] i want to by the help of the lord to
[1:01:10] take a thought out of those two verses
[1:01:12] we've we've read tonight and if i will
[1:01:14] title this sermon tonight i want to
[1:01:16] speak to you on the believer's rest the
[1:01:19] believer's rest how many believers do we
[1:01:21] have here this evening if you're not a
[1:01:23] believer then you're probably not going
[1:01:24] to get much out of this service but if
[1:01:26] you are a believer even you'll get
[1:01:28] something from the word amen we're not
[1:01:29] gathered here tonight as make believers
[1:01:31] we're not gathered here as unbelievers
[1:01:32] i'll go a step further and say we're not
[1:01:34] even gathered here as borderline
[1:01:36] believers amen but i believe we've
[1:01:38] gathered here as real genuine true
[1:01:40] believers of the word of god and there's
[1:01:42] one thing that i find that two things
[1:01:45] that a believer
[1:01:46] must do and that is they must trust in
[1:01:48] god and they must rest in god a true
[1:01:51] believer must trust in god and then a
[1:01:54] true believer must rest in god now i was
[1:01:56] sharing with brother ron i woke up this
[1:01:58] morning and on my heart with scriptures
[1:02:00] and thoughts about trusting and i was
[1:02:02] just praying then the lord just dropped
[1:02:03] this on my heart in order to rest you've
[1:02:06] got to have trust and you know as well
[1:02:08] as i know that when brother ron begin
[1:02:10] this battle that one of the first things
[1:02:12] the lord spoke to him i trust it's okay
[1:02:14] to share this again was if you'll trust
[1:02:16] me i'll use you like never before and
[1:02:18] you know i find that if you don't have
[1:02:20] trust in something then there's no way
[1:02:22] that you can rest if you don't have
[1:02:24] trust in the government then there's no
[1:02:25] way you can rest in what they're doing
[1:02:27] if you don't have trust in a in your
[1:02:29] boss and there's no way you can rest and
[1:02:31] what he's doing so in order to really
[1:02:33] rest you've got to be able to trust and
[1:02:35] david says in psalms 37 5 he says commit
[1:02:38] thy way unto the lord and trust also in
[1:02:41] him and he shall bring it to pass now
[1:02:43] who's going to bring this to pass david
[1:02:45] is not going to bring it to pass and a
[1:02:47] man is not going to bring it to pass but
[1:02:49] david says i'm going to commit this way
[1:02:51] into the lord and he is able to bring it
[1:02:54] to pass the prophet of god said when
[1:02:55] they make a committal to god committed
[1:02:58] to him and believe him amen then it
[1:03:01] brings forth the results so the results
[1:03:03] don't come amen just by hearing or just
[1:03:06] by acknowledging amen but the results
[1:03:08] come when you're able to believe it amen
[1:03:10] and trust in the one that you're hearing
[1:03:12] the trumpet gives an uncertain sound he
[1:03:14] said god made the promise then god is
[1:03:16] going to keep the promise how many
[1:03:18] witnesses do we have here tonight that
[1:03:19] if god makes a promise and then god is
[1:03:22] able to keep the promise see they say
[1:03:24] well how can this thing happen how can
[1:03:26] he get a bunch of people together with
[1:03:28] rapturing grace to go up i don't know
[1:03:30] how he will do it it's not my business
[1:03:32] to ask how he'll do it amen he'll do it
[1:03:35] it's my business just to be ready for it
[1:03:38] amen it's not my business to figure out
[1:03:40] how that he's going to gather a group of
[1:03:42] people from all over the world and give
[1:03:44] them rapturing faith and give them
[1:03:46] rapturing grace and put in them
[1:03:48] rapturing strength i don't know how he's
[1:03:49] going to do it amen but i'm just going
[1:03:51] to be ready because he's going to do it
[1:03:54] amen if he said the walls are going to
[1:03:56] come down i don't know how they're going
[1:03:57] to come down i just know i heard him say
[1:04:00] the walls are coming down i don't know
[1:04:02] how he's going to raise up people amen
[1:04:04] that's been laying in the ground since
[1:04:06] all the way back 6 000 years ago i don't
[1:04:08] know how that job is going to come forth
[1:04:10] i don't know how that elijah and all the
[1:04:12] others is going to come forth amen but
[1:04:14] all i know is he said he will do it and
[1:04:16] everything he ever said he would do amen
[1:04:19] he's been god big enough to do it i
[1:04:21] don't know how he's going to save that
[1:04:22] wayward child amen but his word said he
[1:04:25] will do it and if his word said he will
[1:04:27] do it there ain't enough devils in hell
[1:04:29] amen to back him off with his word if he
[1:04:31] said it'll heal you when you're sick
[1:04:32] there ain't enough devils in hell he
[1:04:34] meant to keep a sickness in your body i
[1:04:36] don't know how he's going to do it i
[1:04:38] don't know when he's going to do it i
[1:04:40] don't know what time he's going to do it
[1:04:41] amen but i've heard the word of the lord
[1:04:44] and the word said he's more than able he
[1:04:46] meant to do exceedingly independently
[1:04:48] above all that we could ever ask her to
[1:04:50] say i don't know when these bodies are
[1:04:52] going to change i just know he said some
[1:04:54] morning we're going to feel a sweet come
[1:04:56] over our bodies and gray hair is going
[1:04:58] to disappear and stupid soldiers are
[1:05:00] going to straighten us i don't know how
[1:05:02] he's going to do it amen but i'm not
[1:05:04] worried about figuring out i'm just
[1:05:06] going to be ready
[1:05:07] i'm just going to be ready because he
[1:05:09] said he would do it he said he would
[1:05:11] bring the life down and he brought him
[1:05:13] down he said he would bring israel
[1:05:15] through and he brought israel through
[1:05:17] there's nothing too big for my god he's
[1:05:19] god on the mountain he's god in the
[1:05:21] valley he's god regardless of the
[1:05:24] conditions there is nothing our god
[1:05:26] cannot do he promised it's going to
[1:05:28] happen and he has fortified his church
[1:05:32] by the promise of his word
[1:05:34] i don't know how it's going to happen i
[1:05:36] don't know when it's going to happen i
[1:05:38] just know it's going to happen
[1:05:40] when i'm already testifying before i
[1:05:42] start preaching amen is there any
[1:05:44] believers here tonight amen that still
[1:05:46] believes god amen can do the impossible
[1:05:49] he can do it when it looks like it can
[1:05:50] never be done you say how can you do it
[1:05:53] because he's god amen what brother
[1:05:55] andrew i've got a problem i can't let go
[1:05:57] of the situation then god can never move
[1:05:59] upon the situation
[1:06:01] well brother andrew i got to keep my
[1:06:03] hands on it amen god can never move as
[1:06:06] long as our hands are on it he said as
[1:06:08] long as you're going to do it if someone
[1:06:11] talks about you and you talk back about
[1:06:13] them god cannot fight your battle amen
[1:06:16] you're fighting it yourself so you just
[1:06:18] let loose and let him do it amen the
[1:06:22] greatest weapon i know of of a christian
[1:06:24] today is a committal to god the greatest
[1:06:28] weapon i know of today of a christian is
[1:06:31] a committal to god when you can't do
[1:06:33] nothing about it amen just committed to
[1:06:36] him and god will take care of every bit
[1:06:39] of it amen when you prayed to you can't
[1:06:42] pray no more just committed unto god
[1:06:44] when you fast it till you can't fast no
[1:06:46] more just committed unto god he is able
[1:06:49] to take care of it do you believe that
[1:06:51] amen david said in psalms 118 and verse
[1:06:54] 8 it is better to trust in the lord than
[1:06:56] to put confidence in man amen i'll put
[1:06:59] my trust in the lord he met above joe
[1:07:01] biden above donald trump above obama and
[1:07:04] his mama i'll put my trust in jesus
[1:07:07] christ he has never entered the arena
[1:07:09] one time but what he has carried out to
[1:07:11] victory he's the god that walks on water
[1:07:14] he's the god that opens blinded eyes
[1:07:16] he's the god that stops funeral
[1:07:18] processions and calls the dead back to
[1:07:20] life again he's the god that takes an
[1:07:22] alcoholic and turns him into a preacher
[1:07:25] he's the god that takes a street walker
[1:07:27] and turns her into a clean living woman
[1:07:29] i'm not talking about a man i'm talking
[1:07:31] about jesus he's the lord he's the lord
[1:07:35] of every devil he's the lord over ever
[1:07:37] sickness he's the lord over every sin
[1:07:39] and he's still big enough and he's still
[1:07:41] strong enough to move upon the face of
[1:07:44] the situation amen
[1:07:45] let me put my voice amen in song in
[1:07:48] solomon's proverbs when he said trust in
[1:07:50] the lord with all thine heart thank you
[1:07:53] brother trust in the lord with all thine
[1:07:55] heart and lean not unto my own
[1:07:57] understanding he'll say isaiah 26 4
[1:08:00] trust you in the lord forever amen for
[1:08:02] in the lord jehovah is everlasting
[1:08:05] strength if you put your trust in the
[1:08:08] lord you will have everlasting strength
[1:08:12] the prophet said there is no big people
[1:08:13] among us there is no great among us we
[1:08:16] are all the same we are the children of
[1:08:19] god there is only one great one among us
[1:08:22] and that is christ how many would agree
[1:08:24] there's only one great one among us and
[1:08:26] that is christ we must recognize him
[1:08:30] amen and if we seek honor one from
[1:08:32] another then we can't have faith because
[1:08:34] we're having faith in one another amen
[1:08:36] if you're seeking honor from one another
[1:08:38] then you're putting your confidence in
[1:08:40] one another amen and you'll never have
[1:08:42] faith in god as long as you're seeking
[1:08:44] honor amen or answers from one another
[1:08:47] he said but when we get to have faith in
[1:08:49] christ he is the one that's among us
[1:08:51] that we must have faith in amen notice
[1:08:54] this he is the one among us that we must
[1:08:57] have faith in and then faith in what
[1:08:59] he's doing and his gift to us so we're
[1:09:02] not just putting our faith in him but
[1:09:04] our faith is in what he's doing he meant
[1:09:06] in us and what he has given us amen i
[1:09:09] find it amazing that in 1956 brother
[1:09:12] branham preaches a sermon called amen
[1:09:14] why are people so tossed about amen it's
[1:09:17] amazing he'll open it up by saying the

[1:13:08] there is no limits on my god
[1:13:11] you don't see how it's going to be
[1:13:13] but there's something holding within the
[1:13:16] veil the plot of god said i saw a ship
[1:13:20] on the water one time in a storm he said
[1:13:22] that old ship there was rocking back and
[1:13:24] forth and there was some waves that
[1:13:25] would go in
[1:13:26] are you ready for this there was some
[1:13:28] waves that would go in there was some
[1:13:30] waves that would go under and everything
[1:13:32] and i said wonder why that is and a
[1:13:35] fellow said it's got a sea anchor on it
[1:13:38] therefore they said the ship cannot sink
[1:13:43] testing one two therefore
[1:13:45] the ship cannot sink i said it can go
[1:13:48] through the waves but it can't sink
[1:13:50] because it's anchored oh praise god
[1:13:53] we've got an anchor some waves we can go
[1:13:56] over some we go under but regardless the
[1:13:58] anchor holds come on amen there's a
[1:14:01] witness here tonight every wave that
[1:14:03] ever come up against you it wasn't big
[1:14:05] enough amen to sink this whole ship
[1:14:07] aside come on now you've been through
[1:14:10] some waves that should have took you to
[1:14:11] the bottom you've been through some
[1:14:13] waves that should have drowned you it
[1:14:14] should have took you out a long time ago
[1:14:16] but you're still sailing on last
[1:14:18] solomaine because you got an anchor and
[1:14:21] it's holding beyond feelings it's
[1:14:23] holding beyond the emotions it's holding
[1:14:25] beyond church hannity there is an anchor
[1:14:27] that is anchored in the eternities no
[1:14:29] wonder the prophet of god said when you
[1:14:31] recognize the word was eagle food and
[1:14:34] you left the other thing you heard from
[1:14:36] your theophany in other words your
[1:14:38] theophany from another dimension tugged
[1:14:41] at you and reminded you that before you
[1:14:43] was born there was already an anchor
[1:14:47] come on how can you lose when there was
[1:14:49] already an anchor on the inside of you
[1:14:51] before you come in the world there was a
[1:14:54] gene seed of god on the inside of your
[1:14:56] soul that was anchoring you to the word
[1:14:58] of god it isn't the ship doing the
[1:15:01] holding it is the anchor doing the
[1:15:02] holding it just isn't what i am or what
[1:15:05] i'll be or what i was it is what he is
[1:15:09] now and what he did for me and you it
[1:15:12] ain't what i can do it's what he has
[1:15:15] done amen how many has ever noticed that
[1:15:17] there's christians amen that's always up
[1:15:19] and down amen they're very religious
[1:15:22] amen but have such a deep desire
[1:15:24] and daily they search and they hunt and
[1:15:26] they seek for god but they never come to
[1:15:29] any settlement or any settled anchor in
[1:15:32] christ you know why that is because the
[1:15:34] prophet said there's two phases of
[1:15:36] christianity he said one of them is an
[1:15:38] intellectual or mental conception which
[1:15:41] takes place in the head he said but i
[1:15:43] love this next one he said but the other
[1:15:45] one is what we call experimental
[1:15:48] experience
[1:15:50] now come on friends ain't that there's
[1:15:52] one that's intellectual or mental
[1:15:54] conception which is in the head he said
[1:15:56] but the other one is what we call a
[1:15:58] mental or not a mental but an
[1:16:00] experimental experience amen where does
[1:16:03] that take place it takes place in the
[1:16:06] heart then you can talk somebody out of
[1:16:08] an intellectual conception but you can't
[1:16:11] talk them out of an experimental
[1:16:12] experience
[1:16:13] you know why because they've seen it
[1:16:15] happen i remember as a little kid i was
[1:16:17] down in my most at my mom's house one
[1:16:19] day we was at home there and i'd taken a
[1:16:21] measuring tape and i hooked it on one
[1:16:23] end of the wall and i pulled it all the
[1:16:24] way down to the other end it's about 10
[1:16:26] 30 11 o'clock that night and i remember
[1:16:28] i was i was in there and mom was in the
[1:16:31] bathroom amen i was measuring stuff
[1:16:33] because i was a construction worker's
[1:16:34] kid you know that's what i wanted to be
[1:16:36] so i was measuring stuff and i was
[1:16:37] getting ready to remodel the house you
[1:16:38] know so i'm in there measuring all of a
[1:16:40] sudden and then the measuring tape drops
[1:16:42] off and it slips down into the outlet
[1:16:45] and it arcs and the thing blows smoke
[1:16:46] and fire and i dropped a thing and took
[1:16:48] off screaming well my uncle may be
[1:16:50] watching my uncle matthew amen he's an
[1:16:53] electrician so he comes down to the
[1:16:54] house and he stands and he says well
[1:16:56] what happened well i said i don't know
[1:16:58] what happened i don't know what happened
[1:17:00] he said now did you do this i don't know
[1:17:02] what happened he said well let me just
[1:17:03] show you what i think happened he said
[1:17:05] here's what happened i think you hooked
[1:17:06] the measuring tape here and you pulled
[1:17:08] it down and just before he did it i said
[1:17:10] don't do it it'll set you on fire it'll
[1:17:12] shock you amen you know why amen because
[1:17:15] as much as i wanted to not believe it in
[1:17:17] my head my heart had experienced a shock
[1:17:20] and there are some believers here
[1:17:21] tonight amen the devil's done everything
[1:17:23] he can amen to talk you out of your
[1:17:26] inheritance to rob you of this message
[1:17:28] to steal your joy and steal your peace
[1:17:30] there's some of you ain't shouted in a
[1:17:32] month of sunday's amen called some old
[1:17:34] dry critical devil amen said we
[1:17:36] shouldn't be shouted in the house of god
[1:17:38] amen but i didn't come to preach to a
[1:17:40] bunch of mental worked up extensions i
[1:17:43] come to talk to somebody that can say i
[1:17:45] know what it's like to be on the sea and
[1:17:48] the waves are rocking and the storm are
[1:17:50] rolling and then jesus come walking on
[1:17:52] the sea i know what it's like when the
[1:17:54] doctor says there's no more hope and
[1:17:56] then the fourth man steps in the room i
[1:17:59] know what it's like when it looks like
[1:18:00] it's all over and he speaks it's just
[1:18:03] getting started i'm talking about
[1:18:05] experimental experienced christians who
[1:18:08] can say amen and fulfill the words of
[1:18:10] john 5 24 he that heareth my word and
[1:18:13] believeth on him that sent me half
[1:18:16] everlasting life
[1:18:18] notice this and should not come into
[1:18:21] condemnation but it's past somebody
[1:18:23] shout past but his passed from death
[1:18:26] unto life the prophet said what do you
[1:18:28] have to do you have to believe and hear
[1:18:30] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:18:33] the word then you are believing and
[1:18:35] applying and resting can we say that
[1:18:38] together believing
[1:18:40] applying
[1:18:41] and resting a true believer believes a
[1:18:45] true believer applies and a true
[1:18:47] believer rests you see it the word says
[1:18:49] soul you hear it so when the word says
[1:18:52] so you hear it then your heart says so
[1:18:54] and you believe it then your whole being
[1:18:57] amen rest in it so your whole being is
[1:19:00] resting in what you're amen and what you
[1:19:02] heard and what your heart believed is
[1:19:05] bringing your whole being subject to the
[1:19:07] word it's here it's in the easter seal
[1:19:09] he said it'll do the same thing in you
[1:19:11] the quickening power that he did in
[1:19:13] jesus he said it brought his body
[1:19:15] subject to the word right he meant in
[1:19:17] that same word in you oh god i know
[1:19:19] people sometimes get hung up when they
[1:19:21] go to preaching about about not living
[1:19:23] and sin and and not smoking cigarettes
[1:19:25] and not drinking it not wearing worldly
[1:19:27] fashions and all these things but let me
[1:19:29] tell you what them are they were little
[1:19:30] little immoral things and i'll tell you
[1:19:32] what the prophet said he said if the
[1:19:34] holy ghost which is the quickening power
[1:19:36] comes in you he said it won't be you say
[1:19:38] i stopped it he said then the immoral
[1:19:41] things will just drop off he meant
[1:19:43] because there's something coming in you
[1:19:45] that's more greater than your human
[1:19:46] ability to reason whether the thing is
[1:19:49] right or not
[1:19:51] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:19:53] the word jesus said are you ready for
[1:19:55] this how many thanks god for prophetic
[1:19:57] interpretation he that heareth my word
[1:20:00] believeth on him that sent me half
[1:20:02] everlasting hath eternal he says never
[1:20:05] ending always existing life ever ever
[1:20:09] exist in life and shall never perish but
[1:20:11] have already passed from death into life
[1:20:14] are you ready for this has passed from
[1:20:16] separation into everlasting presence you
[1:20:20] have passed from separation into
[1:20:24] everlasting presence amen then where is
[1:20:26] the joy of the lord made full it's in
[1:20:28] the presence of god what did a prophet
[1:20:30] say it's in a message called in his
[1:20:31] presence he said no man can come in the
[1:20:34] presence of god and remain the same man
[1:20:36] he was when he came in he'll either
[1:20:38] leave there better or worse amen i say
[1:20:40] thank god that the presence of god has
[1:20:43] returned to the church of god amen not
[1:20:45] just to excite us he meant to but to
[1:20:47] bring a change to put a distinction
[1:20:50] between us in laodicea to put a mark of
[1:20:52] demarcation between us and the things of
[1:20:55] the world amen when you was an alien
[1:20:57] from god you cease to be an alien now
[1:20:59] you are a child are you ready for this
[1:21:01] from death and alive from darkness and
[1:21:03] today amen from mortal to immortal from
[1:21:06] corruption to incorruption from weary
[1:21:09] unto joy from death into life and are
[1:21:12] resting fully upon thus saith the lord
[1:21:16] you're not resting upon what a preacher
[1:21:17] said you're not resting upon what a
[1:21:19] pastor said or even just what a prophet
[1:21:21] said you are resting upon what the lord
[1:21:24] has said in the generation you're living
[1:21:26] in not upon feelings not upon me
[1:21:29] emotions are you hearing me not upon
[1:21:31] theory not upon someone on something
[1:21:33] that somebody has said amen to you that
[1:21:35] had no basis oh i could preach there for
[1:21:37] about three hours not up on something
[1:21:40] that somebody thought would be better
[1:21:41] i'll tell you what they say now they say
[1:21:43] what's better than the holy ghost is
[1:21:44] psychology and i call that a devil
[1:21:47] spirit from the prince of hell amen
[1:21:49] bring that psychology in the house of
[1:21:50] god and you'll have a bunch of rehab
[1:21:52] sinners sitting around talking about
[1:21:54] what god used to do but i just happened
[1:21:56] to draw a sword and cut the head off
[1:21:58] that devil there is no room in the house
[1:22:00] of god amen for rehab we believe in
[1:22:03] transformation by the power of the holy
[1:22:05] ghost i still believe the holy ghost
[1:22:07] amen can take a pervert and make a clean
[1:22:10] living man out of him i still believe
[1:22:12] the holy ghost amen can take a
[1:22:14] homosexual and make a real man out of it
[1:22:16] i still believe the holy ghost can take
[1:22:18] a teenager that's on the road to suicide
[1:22:21] and a premature grave and get a hold of
[1:22:24] him in the presence of god and can cause
[1:22:26] him to pass amen from death into life i
[1:22:29] still believe in the holy ghost
[1:22:32] come on church i still believe god can
[1:22:35] move
[1:22:37] i don't care how dark it is
[1:22:40] i don't care how ugly it is i still
[1:22:42] believe god can transform lives by the
[1:22:45] power of the new birth he can take
[1:22:46] somebody amen from just theories and
[1:22:49] emotions amen and psychologies and
[1:22:51] theories of man upon someone say well
[1:22:54] you come and join our church and it'll
[1:22:56] be finished but upon the word of god
[1:22:58] somebody shout the word of god
[1:23:01] is where the human soul rests
[1:23:04] the word of god is where the human soul
[1:23:07] rests there's that word again but andrew
[1:23:09] rest what is this rest that jesus is
[1:23:12] speaking of it must be so powerful that
[1:23:15] he would actually invite you oh god
[1:23:18] i could preach there for 20 minutes it
[1:23:20] must be so powerful that he would invite
[1:23:22] you to come and partake of it that he
[1:23:24] would stand up and say come unto me all
[1:23:26] ye that are labia and better labor and
[1:23:28] heavy laden and i will give you rest
[1:23:31] amen look at what this word rest means
[1:23:33] are you ready it means to refresh
[1:23:36] it means to cause or permit one to cease
[1:23:40] from any movement or labor in order to
[1:23:43] recover and collect his strength
[1:23:46] somebody shout strength
[1:23:47] this rest is a rest for you to cease
[1:23:50] from any movement or any labor in order
[1:23:53] to recover and to collect strength amen
[1:23:56] it's the means to keep quiet it is of
[1:23:58] calm oh god
[1:24:00] of calm and patient expectation see the
[1:24:04] problem god said in the contest let us
[1:24:06] go in the power of his resurrection let
[1:24:07] us go in the name of jesus christ to
[1:24:09] meet the enemy because he is getting
[1:24:12] stronger and more powerful every day and
[1:24:15] as the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:24:17] spirit of god raises up a standard
[1:24:19] against him if we have come to the end
[1:24:21] of these things and the mysteries of god
[1:24:23] has been completed with us we are
[1:24:25] looking for more strength amen a
[1:24:27] rapturing strength to meet a worse force
[1:24:30] that will rapture the church and take it
[1:24:32] into glory then we don't just need a
[1:24:34] strength to go from one church age to a
[1:24:36] next we're just not looking for a
[1:24:38] strength ain't meant to go from one
[1:24:40] service to an ex wheat but andrew are
[1:24:42] actually looking for strength that's
[1:24:43] going to be so powerful it is literally
[1:24:46] going to lift us off of the earth in a
[1:24:48] dynamic rapture some morning
[1:24:51] well preach preacher thank you i believe
[1:24:52] i will amen i'm talking about a strength
[1:24:55] amen it'll get you through whatever you
[1:24:56] come up against i'm talking about a
[1:24:58] strength that no matter how dark it gets
[1:25:00] when you don't have the strength to
[1:25:02] raise your hand that strength on the
[1:25:04] inside of you will cause you to raise
[1:25:06] your hand this is a strength this is i
[1:25:08] mean let me stop and say this i'm not
[1:25:10] talking about the rest of a laziness i'm
[1:25:12] not talking about a thoughtful kickback

[1:25:15] coffee and don't pray and don't fast
[1:25:18] don't come to church i'm not talking
[1:25:20] about a rest like an easy time i'm
[1:25:22] talking about a rest amen that's rest of
[1:25:24] the soul that brings you from being
[1:25:26] worried and tore up and in and out and
[1:25:27] up and down amen to a place of stability
[1:25:30] now when you speak of this rest you'll
[1:25:32] find there was a physical rest and there
[1:25:34] was a spiritual rest the prophet of god
[1:25:36] says adoption he says israel was
[1:25:39] promised a physical rest he said the
[1:25:41] church was promised a spiritual rest so
[1:25:44] god promised to give us a rest is there
[1:25:47] one promise for the gabriel that god has
[1:25:49] made that he's not been able to fulfill
[1:25:51] is there one promised church that god
[1:25:53] made you and over 600 promises in one
[1:25:56] book called the bible and 1100 tapes and
[1:25:59] books is there one promise you can find
[1:26:01] in there amen that god has not been able
[1:26:04] to fulfill if god said he would give you
[1:26:06] illuminating lights he'd been to see the
[1:26:08] revelation of your age he has fulfilled
[1:26:10] that promise if he said he would send
[1:26:12] malachi 4. this day this promise is
[1:26:14] fulfilled if he said he would fulfill
[1:26:16] luke 17 30 and revelation 10 amen this
[1:26:19] day the scripture's fulfilled then if
[1:26:21] god can fulfill those promises he can
[1:26:23] fulfill this promise what is the rest
[1:26:28] the prophet said where is it is it
[1:26:29] joining church is it being baptized a
[1:26:32] certain way is it becoming a member of
[1:26:34] the greatest church in the city where in
[1:26:35] better clothes is it education is it
[1:26:38] money amen so we can just all quit work
[1:26:40] and lay around the rest of our lives as
[1:26:42] we call it that is not it remember so
[1:26:45] when you think of the word rest you
[1:26:47] think of the word sabbath right which in
[1:26:49] revelation 1 10 i was in the spirit on
[1:26:52] the lord's day time out even going
[1:26:54] preacher for a second that right there's
[1:26:56] the answer to a lot of your problems is
[1:26:58] get out of the flesh one time and get in
[1:27:00] the spirit
[1:27:02] [Music]
[1:27:04] well but i think we got too much shout i
[1:27:06] think we got too many people in the
[1:27:07] flesh i've been in the flesh 25 years
[1:27:10] i've been looking to get out of the
[1:27:11] flesh rather than get in the flesh even
[1:27:14] quit worrying about the flesh let's get
[1:27:15] in the spirit the prophet said if we're
[1:27:18] going to preach let's preach in the
[1:27:19] spirit
[1:27:20] can i take some liberty here amen i'll
[1:27:22] just be honest with you that's okay i'm
[1:27:23] a little tired of intellectual speaking
[1:27:26] i'm ready for some old fat old-fashioned
[1:27:28] sacrifice amen holy ghost field devil
[1:27:31] chasing sin stomping amen pillar of fire
[1:27:33] move and preach it it'll bring the power
[1:27:35] of god back in the church that'll change
[1:27:37] our young people come on we've filled up
[1:27:40] psychologist offices long enough we need
[1:27:42] a change by the power of the holy ghost
[1:27:45] and he's still here and he's still able
[1:27:47] to do it if any two or three will agree
[1:27:49] it's touching any one thing upon the
[1:27:50] earth it shall be done in heaven if you
[1:27:53] agree and i agree the bible says one can
[1:27:55] put a thousand to fly and two can put
[1:27:57] ten thousand then what about a whole
[1:27:59] church full of believers tonight that
[1:28:00] would welcome the spirit of the lord in
[1:28:03] the full gospel revival center and let
[1:28:05] the power of god amen root out every
[1:28:07] root of bitterness destroy every bad
[1:28:09] attitude stabilize every bad mood remove
[1:28:12] every sin and
[1:28:15] destroy every iniquity among friends is
[1:28:18] he's still able to do it or not
[1:28:19] [Applause]
[1:28:21] he's still god
[1:28:22] this rest is more than the flesh this is
[1:28:25] a spiritual rest now the prophet said i
[1:28:27] was in the spirit on the lord's day he
[1:28:29] said that is the whole of the christian
[1:28:32] life
[1:28:34] john was in the spirit on the lord's day
[1:28:38] fine folks called the lord's day the
[1:28:40] sabbath west to them is saturday
[1:28:42] others call the lord's day sunday which
[1:28:44] is the first day of the week but how
[1:28:46] could either of these days be right when
[1:28:48] the bible says amen that john was called
[1:28:51] up in the spirit and transported into
[1:28:54] the lord's day which is yet to come he
[1:28:57] said but in the meantime just to settle
[1:28:59] our minds let's find out exactly what
[1:29:02] this sabbath is he said the sabbath as
[1:29:04] we know from the new testament is not
[1:29:07] the keeping of a certain day then what
[1:29:09] is that that is a law right that is a
[1:29:11] rich we'll keep a certain day amen we
[1:29:13] have no command to keep saturday or do
[1:29:16] we have any commandment to keep the
[1:29:17] first day which is sunday here is the
[1:29:20] truth of the sabbath it means rest now
[1:29:23] in the book of hebrews paul labor's very
[1:29:25] heavy in this point revel
[1:29:27] rather hebrews 3 hebrews 4 to show you
[1:29:30] that god had arrest israel had arrest
[1:29:33] and the church had arrest he said now
[1:29:35] watch god entered his rest he said
[1:29:37] israel never entered their rest amen why
[1:29:40] because of unbelief he said what is
[1:29:42] unbelief unbelief is sin you read in
[1:29:44] hebrews 3 amen do you see amen don't you
[1:29:47] act like they did in the days of
[1:29:49] provocation when they provoke god how
[1:29:52] did they do it brother andrew how did
[1:29:54] they provoke god did they do it by
[1:29:56] living immorally were they out running
[1:29:58] up and down the streets and carousing
[1:30:00] and gambling the prompt of god said no
[1:30:02] the sin is when god shows
[1:30:04] himself and you disbelieve it and won't
[1:30:08] listen to it the sin is when you see the
[1:30:11] manifestation of god you refuse to
[1:30:13] believe what you see and you won't obey
[1:30:15] the instructions that it released
[1:30:19] well i might as well preach i'm here
[1:30:20] hadn't amen amen sin is not smoking sin
[1:30:23] is not breaking sin is not corrosive
[1:30:26] that is the attributes of sin the
[1:30:28] prophet labored from 47 to 65 to drive
[1:30:31] the point home that sin is unbelief amen
[1:30:35] then the bible says let us therefore
[1:30:36] fear amen lest the promised being left
[1:30:39] us of entering into his rest any of you
[1:30:42] should seem to come sort of the prophet
[1:30:44] said only reason there is to fear is if
[1:30:46] there is no promise then if there is no
[1:30:48] promise this church has got a right to
[1:30:50] be under a cloud of fear if there is no
[1:30:53] promise you've got a right for your
[1:30:54] family to be buried under the clouds of
[1:30:56] fear but let me back that devil up in a
[1:30:58] corner and remind you there are more
[1:31:00] than one promise there's a whole bible
[1:31:02] of promises and paul said the promises
[1:31:05] of god are yea and amen and in them
[1:31:08] they're not up one day and down the next
[1:31:09] well thank you lord it's coming faster
[1:31:11] and i can get it out these promises are
[1:31:13] not unstable these are stable promises
[1:31:16] these are absolute promises these are
[1:31:19] more sure word of prophecy promises amen
[1:31:21] god come down to make the promise a
[1:31:24] reality than if it's going to be made a
[1:31:25] reality it's got to be the same promise
[1:31:28] the same rest the same god the same side
[1:31:31] it's got to be the same thing now do you
[1:31:34] realize why they did not enter the rest
[1:31:36] is because the word was preached to all
[1:31:38] but only a few heard and applied and
[1:31:41] rested in the word
[1:31:44] the bible says is this okay for unto us
[1:31:47] the gospel was preached as well as unto
[1:31:49] them but the word preached did not
[1:31:52] profit them not being mixed with faith
[1:31:54] and them that heard it see no matter how
[1:31:57] much the word is preached no matter how
[1:31:59] well you like the way it's been preached
[1:32:01] unless you yourself are a partaker of
[1:32:03] that word it won't do you one bit of
[1:32:06] good
[1:32:07] well brandon i'm going to move churches
[1:32:09] well go ahead and move if the man's
[1:32:11] preaching the message he'll be saying
[1:32:13] the same thing andrew and ron and
[1:32:14] everyone else is saying if he's
[1:32:16] preaching the message well but then i'm
[1:32:18] going to leave this minister amen you
[1:32:19] can move churches till you run out of
[1:32:21] money and u-haul is your best friend but
[1:32:23] until you get some faith in your soul
[1:32:25] ain't meant to receive what you're
[1:32:26] hearing you're never going to grow
[1:32:28] you're never going to be in a fear well
[1:32:30] i might as well take a sword it's time
[1:32:32] to lay aside these baby childish ideas
[1:32:35] and come back to being mature adopted
[1:32:37] sons and daughters of god and let the
[1:32:39] grace of god grow you in the fear and
[1:32:42] admonition of god
[1:32:43] get rid of the pacifier get rid of the
[1:32:45] diaper bag this ain't a picnic this is a
[1:32:48] battleground
[1:32:50] we don't need babies i know we got
[1:32:52] babies coming in and we welcome them
[1:32:54] amen but we need men and women who will
[1:32:56] grow up and be elder who will be real
[1:32:59] gentile soldiers of the mighty el gabor
[1:33:02] and we'll fight with everything that's
[1:33:03] within them
[1:33:08] well preacher i'm gonna leave and go
[1:33:09] find the perfect church don't
[1:33:12] you'll run it
[1:33:14] because the last five you found were
[1:33:16] perfect when you left they were
[1:33:17] imperfect
[1:33:21] well is that
[1:33:24] are you here it's not the church
[1:33:27] heard the pride of god say one day he
[1:33:29] said sometimes you'll move because of
[1:33:30] preaching he said then you'll move
[1:33:32] because of singing he said then you'll
[1:33:33] move because this he said then you'll
[1:33:35] realize the problem all along was you
[1:33:37] [Applause]
[1:33:40] it's just a whole lot easier to put off
[1:33:42] on everybody else
[1:33:45] no matter how well you like it unless
[1:33:47] it's mixed with personal faith you'll
[1:33:50] never do no good see so faith wasn't in
[1:33:53] them that heard the word now the
[1:33:55] protagonist says in hebrews 4 the
[1:33:56] seventh verse he said seven is the
[1:33:58] number of completion three is the number
[1:34:00] of life seven completion that gives a
[1:34:02] complete sabbath and again remember he
[1:34:04] spoke god on this wise spoke of the law
[1:34:07] on this wise and then again he limited a
[1:34:09] day he said third day third time hebrews
[1:34:12] 4 8 for if jesus had given them rest or
[1:34:15] rest day then would he not afterward and
[1:34:17] spoke of another day there remaineth
[1:34:20] therefore a rest which is a sabbath
[1:34:22] keeping to who to the people of god so
[1:34:25] they all came out by moses they all
[1:34:28] heard the same sermons but only two went
[1:34:30] in the promised land
[1:34:33] come on friends amen you you've set
[1:34:35] meetings with people who heard this
[1:34:37] it's a testimony might as well tell it
[1:34:39] amen two men read the same book one man
[1:34:41] got done reading it said that man called
[1:34:43] me a chicken other man said that strange
[1:34:45] he called me an eagle
[1:34:47] amen see because inside of one there was
[1:34:50] a nature of the word to receive the word
[1:34:52] amen the bible says lay aside all
[1:34:54] flirtiness and supernaulity amen of
[1:34:56] filthiness and receive the engrafted
[1:34:59] word with meekness which is able to save
[1:35:01] your soul amen if there's not a heart to
[1:35:03] receive well i might as well preach if
[1:35:05] there's a heart heart you'll never
[1:35:07] receive the word with a heart heart a
[1:35:10] stone resist but a heart of flesh
[1:35:12] receives a heart of stone resists and
[1:35:15] says i ask for brother john that's for
[1:35:17] the jim and that's where they enter hey
[1:35:18] remember the heart of flesh says preach
[1:35:20] the word if it sucks the height off of
[1:35:23] me preach the word i want to leave here
[1:35:25] in a body change if you can hear the
[1:35:27] word
[1:35:28] and receive the word you will become the
[1:35:30] word you will rest in the word there
[1:35:33] remaineth the rest for he that is
[1:35:35] entered into his rest he also has ceased
[1:35:37] but said there is your key phrase god
[1:35:40] has ceased from his own works amen the
[1:35:43] brother said god gave israel the seventh
[1:35:44] day for the sabbath and commemoration of
[1:35:46] his own work where he created the world
[1:35:49] and all that was therein and then he
[1:35:50] stopped creating are you ready for this
[1:35:52] he ceased from his labors he rested
[1:35:57] so when the bible says there will come a
[1:35:59] sabbath rest are you still with me can i
[1:36:01] keep going for he that is entered into
[1:36:04] his rest the prophet of god picks this
[1:36:06] up and says this entering in is not only
[1:36:10] an entering in but it is a remaining in
[1:36:13] the rest it is an eternal rest oh thank
[1:36:18] god this is not a temporary up one day
[1:36:21] and down the next i'm on church how men
[1:36:23] can say thank god he sent us a message
[1:36:26] that would call us out of laodicea
[1:36:28] pentecostal babylonian confusion where
[1:36:31] one day i'm saved and the next day i'm
[1:36:33] lost and one day i'm going to make it
[1:36:35] and the next day i'm not i'm on friends
[1:36:37] you ever been there have you ever come
[1:36:38] to church i'll tell you what this
[1:36:40] message will do it'll put a stability in
[1:36:42] you
[1:36:43] amen no matter what condition the church
[1:36:45] is in if this message is in your heart
[1:36:47] it'll anchor you it'll stabilize you
[1:36:51] you preachers have been there you
[1:36:53] preached the people at one service they
[1:36:55] was on top of the world go back the next
[1:36:57] service it looked like the world was on
[1:36:58] top of them do you know why amen because
[1:37:01] they've never come to a rest they've
[1:37:03] never come to a place where if the sun
[1:37:05] is shining amen they're shouting and if
[1:37:07] the clouds are forming they're pouting
[1:37:09] but i'm talking about some real rugged
[1:37:11] believers i'm talking about some
[1:37:13] believers that don't have to be pampered
[1:37:15] and they don't have to be petted amen if
[1:37:17] the whole church is cold they're on fire
[1:37:19] if ain't nobody shouting they'll break
[1:37:21] out right in the middle of the service
[1:37:22] and begin to shout aloud you know why
[1:37:24] because they found an anchor and they
[1:37:26] feel a tug from another dimension it's
[1:37:29] not coming from the flesh it's not
[1:37:31] coming from the moratorium it's coming
[1:37:33] from an immortal dementia i'm old church
[1:37:35] you might as well face it william
[1:37:37] branham wasn't the only creature of two
[1:37:39] worlds this message has put you in the
[1:37:41] same place that a prophet stood
[1:37:44] [Applause]
[1:37:46] well you might as well back that devil
[1:37:48] off of you right now this message has
[1:37:50] put you between two worlds
[1:37:53] two dimensions
[1:37:54] oh god oh god i can't take much time
[1:37:57] here but it's coming out okay you know
[1:37:59] what the bible says the bible says it
[1:38:00] like this there is therefore now no
[1:38:02] condemnation to who to them that are in
[1:38:05] christ jesus do you realize amen
[1:38:07] sometimes in your bible you're going to
[1:38:09] read the word jesus christ then you're
[1:38:11] going to read christ jesus let me ask
[1:38:13] you something what was here first jesus
[1:38:16] or christ i'll tell you who was here
[1:38:18] first the christ was because the christ
[1:38:21] is this okay the christ was the
[1:38:23] anointing right amen the bible says in
[1:38:26] the beginning was the word and the word
[1:38:27] was with god and the word was god and
[1:38:30] the word became flesh and we called his
[1:38:32] name
[1:38:33] jesus amen then the christ was here amen
[1:38:36] and jesus was born so when you read in
[1:38:39] your bible about jesus christ you will
[1:38:42] read about after the birth but when you
[1:38:44] read christ jesus you are reading about
[1:38:46] before the foundation of the world
[1:38:48] because before there was a body there
[1:38:50] was a christ which was an anointing
[1:38:53] which was a logos that would possess the
[1:38:55] body oh glory to god do you realize
[1:38:57] where there was no condemnation found in
[1:39:00] you it was found before the foundation
[1:39:03] of the world then where does the
[1:39:05] strength come from to believe is because
[1:39:08] before you was a sinner you was a son
[1:39:11] before you was a drinker you was a son
[1:39:14] of god before you was addicted to pain
[1:39:16] medicine you was a child of god and when
[1:39:18] there is no more drugs and there is no
[1:39:21] more alcohol and there is no more cancer
[1:39:23] and there is no more sugar diabetes and
[1:39:25] there is no more painkillers you will
[1:39:27] still be a son of god
[1:39:32] lord of god you was connected to an
[1:39:36] anchor before the foundation of the
[1:39:39] world
[1:39:41] you're going to get through
[1:39:44] you're going to get through
[1:39:45] you're going to make it i don't care how
[1:39:48] low you are tonight there is an anchor
[1:39:50] in an unseen dimension
[1:39:52] pulling you
[1:39:55] [Applause]
[1:39:57] but you might as well square your
[1:39:58] shoulders back a little bit
[1:40:00] you got a right to
[1:40:02] go ahead and tell that devil before i
[1:40:03] was a slave i was a son
[1:40:07] before i was addicted to drugs i was
[1:40:09] addicted to god
[1:40:10] [Applause]
[1:40:12] come on before there was one sin imputed
[1:40:14] unto me i was in the mind of god
[1:40:19] what is the sabbath rest
[1:40:23] it is
[1:40:25] entering in see then thus we see why god
[1:40:28] could not give us any one certain day of
[1:40:30] the week
[1:40:31] we have entered into
[1:40:33] and do remain in our rest which israel
[1:40:36] could not do having only a shadow of
[1:40:39] true substance of what we enjoy so when
[1:40:41] we receive this rest or the continuing
[1:40:43] sabbath it is at the invitation of jesus
[1:40:46] what did he say in matthew 11 28 come
[1:40:49] into me all ye
[1:40:50] that are lady and labor and are heavy
[1:40:52] laden and i will give you rest see take
[1:40:56] my yoke upon you and learn of me
[1:40:59] how many wants to learn of him
[1:41:00] for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye
[1:41:04] shall find rest unto your souls now
[1:41:07] here's what i want to say no matter how
[1:41:09] long
[1:41:10] you have been labored under the load of
[1:41:12] sin whether it is 10 years 20 years or
[1:41:15] 30 years or 50 years he is inviting you
[1:41:21] to come with your weird tiring weird and
[1:41:24] tired weary not weird you're tired and
[1:41:28] weary life
[1:41:31] i just went around the world
[1:41:34] you're tired
[1:41:35] and weary life
[1:41:37] and you will find his rest
[1:41:40] jesus will give you the rest see then
[1:41:43] what exactly is the rest that jesus will
[1:41:45] give to whom he said this is the rest
[1:41:48] wherein you may cause the worry to rest
[1:41:50] and this is the refreshing yet they
[1:41:53] would not hear isaiah prophesy to this
[1:41:55] rest 700 years
[1:41:58] before it come on the scene 700 years
[1:42:01] later at pentecost
[1:42:03] oh god at pentecost this rest come he
[1:42:07] said what is the rest the rest is the
[1:42:10] holy ghost
[1:42:13] thus when they were filled with the holy
[1:42:15] ghost they ceased from their worldly
[1:42:17] works their worldly doings their evil
[1:42:19] ways the holy ghost took charge of their
[1:42:22] lives they entered into the rest amen
[1:42:25] that is your sabbath it's not a day
[1:42:29] it's not a year but the eternity of
[1:42:32] being filled and blessed with the holy
[1:42:34] spirit are you ready for this it is you
[1:42:37] ceasing and god doing it is god in you
[1:42:41] willing and doing of his good pleasure
[1:42:43] then see the world right now is crying
[1:42:46] for this rest
[1:42:49] the government is looking for rest the
[1:42:52] politics are looking for rest see
[1:42:54] they're trying to steal the cry by a
[1:42:57] religious process of keeping certain
[1:43:00] days or accepting denominational creeds
[1:43:02] and dogmas but failing in that when they
[1:43:05] can't do it by that then they'll go to
[1:43:07] drinking then they'll go to corrals and
[1:43:09] in every physical excess thinking that
[1:43:11] by worldly pleasures there can be some
[1:43:13] satisfaction but in such there is no
[1:43:16] rest now i know that you would think
[1:43:18] that this next quote doesn't apply to
[1:43:20] christians but a prophet said it so it's
[1:43:22] okay i'm going to put my voice with the
[1:43:24] voice of a prophet and say they smoke
[1:43:27] and take pills to quieten their nerves
[1:43:31] well we just might as well deal with it
[1:43:32] we're here they're racing up all over
[1:43:34] the world amen well if it's green and it
[1:43:36] comes from the earth and it's called
[1:43:38] marijuana it must be okay it is a devil
[1:43:43] it is a substitute that has been put
[1:43:46] before the people as an answer to the
[1:43:48] rest well brother andrew it must be okay
[1:43:50] because a doctor prescribed the pills
[1:43:52] amen them doctors don't a bit more care
[1:43:54] about you amen than the man the moon
[1:43:56] they're looking at a check that's coming
[1:43:58] in at the end of the week because of how
[1:44:00] many prescriptions they wrote i tell you
[1:44:02] what amen won't you take a pill that'll
[1:44:04] quieten your nerves it's called the
[1:44:06] gospel
