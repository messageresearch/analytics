[48:55] Jesus Christ recognizing father that
[48:58] right here Lord right now Lord standing
[49:01] before us is the greatest that is the
[49:05] greatest people on Earth to realize that
[49:07] they are the purchase of what Calvary
[49:10] stood for standing here father is the
[49:13] purchasing power of it father to see
[49:15] what you have done Lord it shows us what
[49:19] you value in life when you redeem Sons
[49:22] and Daughters of God from the dust of
[49:24] the earth that were condemned by the
[49:27] fall but according to Thy word father
[49:29] you predestined us Lord not to stay in a
[49:33] condemned state but to be completely
[49:36] restored by the word of God father we
[49:38] stand here under the shadows of the most
[49:41] high and we ask Lord that thou would us
[49:44] come tonight and you just extend out thy
[49:47] wings of mercy upon our life that you
[49:51] would just touch us Lord we've we've
[49:53] went through another week father we've
[49:55] come back to the house of God our faith
[49:59] Lord sometimes it gets to where we think
[50:01] it's it's at its limits father and then
[50:03] you just begin to give us a another push
[50:06] in the Supernatural and I pray father
[50:09] that you would allow us Lord Lord to
[50:12] inforce the claims Lord as Sons and
[50:15] Daughters of God by a restored word to
[50:18] tell the enemy he has no rights on our
[50:20] property he has no rights in our bodies
[50:24] and father I pray that you would be as
[50:26] good as your word tonight that you would
[50:28] come and vindicate your word you would
[50:31] manifest yourself father you see every
[50:33] one of us here every prayer request
[50:36] every unspoken need even things that
[50:38] we're suffering in our own bodies that
[50:41] maybe others may not know Lord you're
[50:43] the kind of God that you can take the
[50:45] word and be a discerner of the thoughts
[50:47] and the intents of the heart and answer
[50:50] all the questions of our body and our
[50:52] soul and our mind Lord we turn this
[50:55] service over to you father father we we
[50:58] commit it to you father and we realize
[51:00] Lord that we are not just we're not just
[51:02] here alone we realize that angels have
[51:05] gathered to watch us
[51:07] worship father but Lord more than angels
[51:10] that are in this place the very one that
[51:13] spoke Let There Be is right here and
[51:17] Lord we just want to set aside a place
[51:20] for you to come and inhabit our heart
[51:24] Lord tonight in the name of the Lord we
[51:27] ask your blessings on this service upon
[51:30] your people and upon those that would
[51:33] car archive this sermon I pray that you
[51:36] would bless them abundantly now father
[51:39] we turn over this service to you for the
[51:42] glory of God in Jesus name amen if you
[51:46] have your Bibles this evening we'd like
[51:48] to look over in the book of
[51:50] Galatians the book of Galatians chap 3
[51:53] verse 24
[52:11] how many love the word of God amen amen
[52:15] that's what we're here for this
[52:18] evening Galatians chapter 3 and verse
[52:21] 24 and the Bible says here wherefore the
[52:24] law was our school master to bring us
[52:27] unto Christ that we might be
[52:30] justified by faith but after that faith
[52:33] has come we are no longer under a school
[52:36] Master for ye are all the children of
[52:39] God by faith in Christ Jesus I'd like to
[52:43] just re-emphasize that scripture verse
[52:46] 26 for ye are all the children of God by
[52:49] faith in Christ Jesus for as
[52:53] many for as many of you as have been
[52:56] baptized into Christ have put on Christ
[53:00] neither there is neither Jew nor Greek
[53:03] there is neither Bond nor free there is
[53:06] neither male nor female for you for ye
[53:09] are all one in Christ Jesus and if ye be
[53:14] Christ then are you Abraham's seed and
[53:17] hirs according to the promise may God
[53:20] bless his word you may be seated tonight
[53:22] in the presence of the Lord and by the
[53:24] help of the Lord I'd like to speak to
[53:26] you again on this on this thought that
[53:29] we were that we were speaking on last
[53:32] weekend on it's matching it's matching
[53:36] time and we realize that that what we
[53:39] have received is a message from another
[53:42] world it's a message from the very it's
[53:44] a message from glory and we realize that
[53:47] that we just kind of turn our minds just
[53:50] for a minute that we we realize that
[53:52] when brother brandham is there in the
[53:54] latter part of his ministry that brother
[53:56] brandham is he's caught up and he he
[53:58] goes he goes beyond the curtain of time
[54:01] and there you just you just remember
[54:03] that brother brandham is there before
[54:04] the multitudes and brother brandom asked
[54:06] the question are all these brandom and
[54:08] he said no these are your converts the
[54:11] voice that was speaking to him said no
[54:12] these are your converts and and and the
[54:15] the one that was speaking to him told
[54:17] him said now you were you were born a
[54:19] leader on Earth and you will be you will
[54:22] be judged by what you preach you will be
[54:25] responsible for what you preached and
[54:27] brother brandham asked this question he
[54:29] said now he said now will Paul be judged
[54:31] by what he preached and the and the
[54:33] voice spoke back said yes Paul will be
[54:36] responsible for what he preached and
[54:38] William brandham said he said then I he
[54:40] said I have preached what Paul preached
[54:43] and a voice came out of the multitudes
[54:45] and said we're resting we're resting on
[54:48] that and we realize that that what this
[54:51] message has done it has turned our
[54:53] hearts back to the same faith of Paul we
[54:56] literally I have watched a restoration
[54:59] how that the word of God has matched
[55:02] this message has matched the faith of
[55:04] the forefathers of of of Paul and Peter
[55:07] and and those that had that had labored
[55:10] in the in the faith there that we
[55:12] realize that we are not just contending
[55:14] for a faith but we are contending for
[55:17] the faith and we realize that that we
[55:19] are a restored people with restored
[55:22] hearts and we realize that the god that
[55:24] we're serving is an unchanging God in
[55:27] all of his ways he is an unchanging God
[55:29] in all of his Dynamics he is an
[55:31] unchanging God so that what he said in
[55:33] the beginning if he said it there he
[55:35] always has to remain the same and has to
[55:38] keep the same pattern every single time
[55:41] we realize that Eve that Eve turned down
[55:43] the word of God and she she turned down
[55:46] the word of God and because of that one
[55:48] because of that one misconstrued word
[55:50] that it brought about the fall but we
[55:52] realize that that God did not change but
[55:55] it was Eve that changed changed the
[55:57] pattern or matched she matched what the
[55:59] serpent was speaking and preaching to
[56:01] her but she did not fully align herself
[56:04] with what the word of God said now
[56:06] brother random said in the Ephesian
[56:08] Church age he said what the church was
[56:10] at Pentecost is the standard he said
[56:12] that is the pattern he said there is no
[56:15] other pattern he said no matter what the
[56:16] scholars say God has not changed that
[56:19] pattern what God did at Pentecost he has
[56:22] to keep on doing until the church ages
[56:24] closes and if we're going to do anything
[56:27] as a Church of the Living God we want to
[56:29] pattern oursel according to what a
[56:32] message that we realize that the
[56:34] multitudes that have gone before and the
[56:36] multitudes that are here now we are
[56:39] resting fully Upon A restored word and
[56:42] we want to preach according to what Paul
[56:44] preached we want to live according to
[56:47] the message that William brandham
[56:48] brought us we realize if we're going to
[56:50] do anything in this life we want to
[56:52] match our testimony we want to match our
[56:54] life we want to match our action
[56:56] according to the word of God now brother
[56:58] Brandon was up in New York one time and
[57:00] he was he was going about the city and
[57:02] he you know how how a southern is in the
[57:05] New York City and he said he said there
[57:06] I was he said I was trying to be helpful
[57:09] and he said I was trying to be helpful
[57:10] and he said I watch this woman she she
[57:12] had fell down and everybody just walked
[57:14] past her brother random said that poor
[57:15] woman he said I helped her get back up
[57:17] to her feet and he said nobody picked
[57:19] her up he said but I helped her up and
[57:21] helped her get her groceries back up
[57:22] underneath of her and he said that woman
[57:24] just looked at me real strange
[57:26] and and it really bothered him that that
[57:29] that nobody would help her and how
[57:30] everybody how he would speak to people
[57:32] and nobody would talk back to him and
[57:34] brother bandam was riding in a cab and
[57:36] he begins to tell the driver about this
[57:38] and the cab driver said he said mister
[57:40] he said when anybody comes to New York
[57:43] and he said they act and and acts like
[57:45] they're in their right mind he said we
[57:47] know he's a
[57:48] stranger said them he said them are good
[57:51] people said but they're just getting
[57:53] into that swing he said you take a man
[57:56] that comes here it isn't long until he's
[57:58] in that same condition he comes in here
[58:00] he say tries to do everything said you
[58:03] could lay there down the street in a
[58:04] heart attack somebody would think that
[58:06] you was drunk they'd never touch you let
[58:08] you lay there and die that that he said
[58:11] he said they don't mean to be that way
[58:13] he said it's just getting in the swing
[58:15] of things he said that's the way we do
[58:17] brethren in our church life we get into
[58:20] a swing of one certain Creed or one
[58:22] certain thing and this and there we stay
[58:24] see we swing with the rest of them we
[58:27] swing with our organization we swing
[58:29] with our community it's just natural he
[58:31] said you paint your steps red he said
[58:33] you watch your neighbor does he said
[58:35] they'll do that too oh he said one of
[58:37] our sister gets a certain kind of dress
[58:39] or a hat and watch what your neighbors
[58:41] does he said it's an impersonation it's
[58:44] a matching time he said we don't care
[58:46] whether our trousers match our coats we
[58:49] want our experience to match the word of
[58:51] God you see they were just in the swing
[58:54] of things and I I I want to may may
[58:57] maybe just make this statement the world
[58:59] is swinging this way and the world is
[59:00] swinging that way but I just can't get
[59:03] in the swing of the things that the
[59:05] world is doing that way but I I will say
[59:07] it like this that that I will say this
[59:09] oh swing down one of these days oh
[59:11] chariots and let me step on and let me
[59:14] ride that's the only kind of swing that
[59:16] we want to put oursel in we want to
[59:18] match oursel according to the word of
[59:21] God you see that we realize that that is
[59:23] how the prodical son got himself in
[59:25] trouble that he wanted to pattern
[59:27] himself after the crowds of the world
[59:30] but we don't want to pattern oursel
[59:32] according to the crowds of the world but
[59:33] we want to pattern ourself by the
[59:35] anointed one and we have received an
[59:38] anointed message an anointed word we've
[59:40] seen the evidence of an anointed one on
[59:42] tape and in book but it's not just in
[59:45] tape and it's not just in book but there
[59:47] is a living God a living God that has
[59:51] manifested his power right here amongst
[59:53] the Church of the Living God and I want
[59:55] to say this this that I am proud to be
[59:57] identified with a people that have
[59:59] aligned themselves and have matched
[1:00:01] themselves up according to the same
[1:00:03] faith that was in Paul I want to say I'm
[1:00:05] proud to be a part of a people that
[1:00:08] refus to get in the swing of things of
[1:00:10] what the rest of the world is doing I'm
[1:00:13] proud to be a part of the Church of the
[1:00:15] Living God that refuses to be a part of
[1:00:18] leosia that refuses to be a part of
[1:00:21] Satan's snares and Satan's eeden I'm
[1:00:24] proud I am so proud to be a part of a
[1:00:27] people that have lined themsel up
[1:00:29] according to the
[1:00:31] faith that's worth contending
[1:00:35] for Hallelujah when you look out upon
[1:00:38] the rest of the world they don't see
[1:00:40] like you see it they don't understand
[1:00:42] like you understand you look at the
[1:00:44] disciples when they when they were
[1:00:46] walking with Jesus they saw Christ but
[1:00:50] the Pharisees saw
[1:00:51] beot the woman at the well she saw
[1:00:55] Messiah the woman with the alabaster box
[1:00:58] what did she recognize in him that he
[1:01:00] was worth everything that she had she
[1:01:03] had took all of her money and she spent
[1:01:05] all her righteous living she' done
[1:01:07] everything every evil deed but when she
[1:01:09] saw this man she saw something different
[1:01:12] about this man than what she'd ever seen
[1:01:14] in anybody else she saw something about
[1:01:17] I'll say that she saw the lamb she saw
[1:01:20] that this man was worth everything that
[1:01:23] she'd worked for all of her life all of
[1:01:25] her evildoings she saw something that
[1:01:29] was worth pouring out her fortune on
[1:01:32] Hallelujah she saw the lamb but the
[1:01:36] Pharisees and the Sadducees saw a false
[1:01:39] prophet you see what the difference was
[1:01:42] is that the seed that was in that woman
[1:01:45] was not in those men the seed that was
[1:01:48] on the inside of that woman at the well
[1:01:51] was not in the Pharisees the major
[1:01:54] difference between them between the
[1:01:56] elect and the non-elect is the seat of
[1:01:59] God you see the reason why you respond
[1:02:02] to the word of the word of this hour is
[1:02:05] because there has been a jean seed of
[1:02:07] God that has been deposited in this hour
[1:02:10] and you watch what William brandham does
[1:02:12] in these last closing statements of his
[1:02:14] of his life he's standing there and he's
[1:02:17] pushing it through 1963 but you come
[1:02:20] down to the last five services that
[1:02:22] William Brandon preaches and he is
[1:02:24] pushing he is pushing pushing he is
[1:02:27] pushing that there is a jingit of God
[1:02:29] that is the very image of almighty God
[1:02:32] he is pushing it and I want to say
[1:02:35] exactly like William brandham said it
[1:02:37] that the seed that goes in the ground
[1:02:39] has got to come up and what has been
[1:02:42] deposited by the message of the hour
[1:02:45] will simply bring forth a message grown
[1:02:49] Church you see the seed that goes down
[1:02:52] has got to come back up again you see
[1:02:55] the expectation of the swer knows what
[1:02:57] he seed into the ground he knows where
[1:03:00] he's dropped Faith he knows where he's
[1:03:02] dropped Grace he knows where he's
[1:03:04] dropped persuasion he knows where he's
[1:03:06] dropped perseverance he knows those
[1:03:08] things he knows what he's deposited in
[1:03:11] you so he is actually Hallelujah he is
[1:03:14] actually looking for you to manifest
[1:03:17] what has been
[1:03:20] deposited Hallelujah there's some seed
[1:03:23] that is appointed that is appointed to
[1:03:26] fall on the Wayside there are some seed
[1:03:28] that is appointed that they're going to
[1:03:30] fall they're going to fall on Stony
[1:03:32] ground but there is some seed that is
[1:03:34] appointed not to wrath but it is
[1:03:36] appointed for birth it is appointed for
[1:03:39] Glory and there is some seed that's
[1:03:41] going to find itself in the word of God
[1:03:43] in the ground of the word of God that
[1:03:45] will manifest what he deposited I want
[1:03:49] to say the seed that is on the inside of
[1:03:51] you matches what the Rapture
[1:03:54] is I will say this about you that the
[1:03:57] seed that is on the inside of you proves
[1:03:59] that you're a Divinity a Divinity class
[1:04:02] of people a people that is called to
[1:04:04] come up a little bit higher I want to
[1:04:07] say this that you're not just a chicken
[1:04:10] you're not you don't have the seat of a
[1:04:11] chicken on the inside of you you don't
[1:04:13] have the seat of a Hulk on the inside of
[1:04:15] you you don't have the seat of a buzzard
[1:04:17] on the inside of you but you have been
[1:04:19] caught up like it said in Revelation
[1:04:21] chap 4 come up here a little bit higher
[1:04:24] and the reason why you're a able to come
[1:04:26] up a little bit higher is because what
[1:04:28] has been
[1:04:31] deposited your reaction to the word of
[1:04:33] God proves what's on the inside of you
[1:04:36] let me say this to you there's a lot of
[1:04:38] people that have came and have amened
[1:04:40] the word of God then then they walked
[1:04:42] out the door and never allowed the word
[1:04:44] of God to fix them or change their
[1:04:47] situation but what is the proving and
[1:04:50] vindicating fact is let the storms come
[1:04:53] let the Trials come let situations come
[1:04:56] let Satan do his worst and that seed
[1:05:00] Remains the
[1:05:04] Same
[1:05:08] Hallelujah you see you have received a
[1:05:11] word of a different level from a
[1:05:14] different environment from a different
[1:05:17] atmosphere because an eagle in the
[1:05:19] natural is unmatched in his eyesight
[1:05:22] there's not another bird that can see
[1:05:25] like an eagle sees there's not another
[1:05:27] bird that can Fly Like an Eagle flies
[1:05:30] you see a buzzard cannot follow an eagle
[1:05:32] where he is going a chicken cannot
[1:05:34] follow an eagle where he is going that
[1:05:36] eagle is born for a specific season and
[1:05:40] reason for what he is born in and he
[1:05:42] knows exactly what he's born to do and
[1:05:45] that's why God would liken His prophets
[1:05:48] under Eagles is because they are Divine
[1:05:51] seeders of the word of God they are
[1:05:53] elected to be able to see what what
[1:05:56] others cannot see that's why this
[1:05:59] message this fourth Beast that has rose
[1:06:02] up to give you an anointing of a Rapture
[1:06:04] anointing to allow you to see past the
[1:06:07] denominations and the Creeds this
[1:06:09] message has given you an ability to
[1:06:12] match the realm of faith that you are
[1:06:15] built
[1:06:16] for this message gave you that access
[1:06:20] let me say this without this message you
[1:06:22] cannot access the Realms of faith that
[1:06:24] is predestined it for a third pool kind
[1:06:26] of
[1:06:27] people I ain't just talking about
[1:06:29] miracles here I'm talking about I'm
[1:06:32] talking about natural life living out a
[1:06:35] gospel Christian Life you cannot access
[1:06:39] the faith to overcome leosia with Billy
[1:06:42] Graham's message you cannot access the
[1:06:45] faith to overcome leosia with orl
[1:06:47] Robert's message but with a message from
[1:06:50] a
[1:06:50] king you have access to overcome the
[1:06:54] Realms of Darkness right here in the
[1:06:57] midst of Le Osa you are a people that
[1:06:59] are built to enter into a
[1:07:03] city and Jesus would test this faith in
[1:07:09] people to see whether they really had it
[1:07:11] or not to see to see what if they could
[1:07:15] prove who they were because Jesus would
[1:07:18] deny them rights and they would still
[1:07:21] press on because when you go to reading
[1:07:23] the scripture that you find that the
[1:07:25] woman of can of the SOP phenician woman
[1:07:28] when she came to him and said thou son
[1:07:30] of David have mercy upon my daughter she
[1:07:33] is grievously vexed with the
[1:07:36] devil Jesus turned to her and said I am
[1:07:39] not given to your race of dogs he called
[1:07:42] her a dog but even in all of that she
[1:07:46] was so perseverant that she turned to
[1:07:50] him that she turned to him and said Lord
[1:07:53] that's the truth you see she had no
[1:07:56] rights Hallelujah she had no rights on
[1:07:58] him as the son of David but when she
[1:08:01] addressed him Hallelujah as who he was
[1:08:05] her faith and her language matched up to
[1:08:08] what he
[1:08:09] was come on somebody she was a gentile
[1:08:12] woman she didn't have rights to him as a
[1:08:15] son of David but as the lord of the
[1:08:18] Harvest he seen that seed laying
[1:08:22] there and he called to it and said I've
[1:08:25] not seen such great faith in all of
[1:08:29] Israel brother mam said it in this way
[1:08:32] when she was walking back
[1:08:34] home he said she passed her pastor that
[1:08:38] was the pastor of the Goddess that she
[1:08:40] was serving and said what are you doing
[1:08:42] following that
[1:08:43] man she said he told me that my daughter
[1:08:46] was going to be perfectly
[1:08:47] whole he said she was in a fit when I
[1:08:50] left the home she was having one of them
[1:08:53] demon fits when she left when I left the
[1:08:55] home home but when she got back home the
[1:08:58] faith that she had to call him Lord had
[1:09:02] matched in her
[1:09:07] body I'm talking about a people that
[1:09:10] know how to match thems up to the word
[1:09:14] of God you're getting ready to see
[1:09:17] something that the rest of the world has
[1:09:19] not entertained
[1:09:21] before brother random said in the Feast
[1:09:23] of trumpets he said the bride is with
[1:09:25] the word are one he said how can there
[1:09:27] be one when that word that's wrote in
[1:09:29] there becomes in you and makes you and
[1:09:32] the word become one it's like a man and
[1:09:35] a wife and theyve made a decision that
[1:09:38] they're going to be husband and wife she
[1:09:40] can she can dress the part she can look
[1:09:43] the part he can tell her that she's
[1:09:46] going to be his but she is never his
[1:09:49] until he accepts her as his wife she can
[1:09:53] come down the altar she can have the
[1:09:55] dress on she can have all the all the
[1:09:58] all the elements of a of a of a
[1:09:59] beautiful bride she can have her flowers
[1:10:02] in her hand she can have all the
[1:10:04] elements of a bride of a wife and a
[1:10:06] bride but until he makes her his own she
[1:10:10] is simply just another woman but when he
[1:10:13] accepts her as a wife she then is
[1:10:17] identified no longer as Twain but it's
[1:10:20] one and that's what William brandham
[1:10:23] said that's the way the message is you
[1:10:25] can't sympathize with it and say it's
[1:10:26] right but you've got to take it to
[1:10:28] yourself to become a part of it then you
[1:10:31] and the message become one then the
[1:10:34] anointing with you the anointing is with
[1:10:37] you as it was with others so we don't
[1:10:40] want to just be sympathizers of the
[1:10:43] message we want to be conformed to the
[1:10:46] very image of the word of God we don't
[1:10:49] want to be just AG Greers of the word
[1:10:51] but we want to be men and women of
[1:10:53] action as a the Bible said in John James
[1:10:56] 1 and22 that be ye doers of the word
[1:11:00] that word doer means to be a performer
[1:11:03] of the word and not hearers only
[1:11:05] deceiving your own selves for if any be
[1:11:08] a hearer of the word and not a doer he's
[1:11:09] La un to a man beholding his natural
[1:11:12] face in the glass so we want our
[1:11:14] testimony to be the same thing as what
[1:11:18] we're hearing we want our actions come
[1:11:21] on somebody we want our actions to be in
[1:11:23] line with what we're hearing
[1:11:25] if Caleb and Joshua don't stand up and
[1:11:27] prove what they are saying or what they
[1:11:30] have heard for prophecy for for 400
[1:11:33] years if they don't act out what the
[1:11:36] part that they are to do they're simply
[1:11:38] hearers of it but Caleb and Joshua Stood
[1:11:41] Still and they stealed the people and
[1:11:44] said we're more than able to take it it
[1:11:46] proved that what they had heard and what
[1:11:49] they were saying was exactly in line
[1:11:52] with what was spoken to Abraham
[1:11:57] we want to be performers of the word is
[1:11:59] that right we want to be performers of
[1:12:01] the word not just am manners of the word
[1:12:04] we want to be a performer of the word
[1:12:05] that like Jesus said in Matthew 18 and
[1:12:08] 19 that again I say unto you that if two
[1:12:11] of you shall agree on Earth as touching
[1:12:14] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[1:12:16] done for them of My Father which is in
[1:12:18] heaven for where two or three are
[1:12:20] gathered together in my name there I am
[1:12:23] in the midst of them
[1:12:26] how do you do that brother Andrew be a
[1:12:28] performer of the word we don't want to
[1:12:30] just sit around and say that we we don't
[1:12:32] want to sit around and say that we just
[1:12:34] have gathered on message we didn't come
[1:12:36] here just to talk about the message we
[1:12:38] come here to get in the message to be a
[1:12:41] performer of the word is to do what
[1:12:43] Deuteronomy 22 and5 says the woman shall
[1:12:45] not wear that which pertaineth unto a
[1:12:48] man neither shall a man put on a woman's
[1:12:50] garment for all that do so are an
[1:12:53] Abomination unto the Lord my God so if
[1:12:56] you see a woman that's professing to be
[1:12:59] a Christian and dressing herself up like
[1:13:01] a jezebel she is not a performer of the
[1:13:04] word of
[1:13:06] God if you see a man that's professing
[1:13:09] to be a Christian and's got skinny jeans
[1:13:12] tighter than a
[1:13:14] jumpsuit dresses up like a woman acts
[1:13:17] like a woman he's not a performer of the
[1:13:19] word
[1:13:26] we want to match
[1:13:28] everything we want to be performers of
[1:13:30] the word right so the Bible said we want
[1:13:33] to be in line with the Bible so the
[1:13:35] Bible said in Malachi 3:8 will a man rob
[1:13:37] God yet Heath robbed me be but ye say
[1:13:40] wherein have we robbed thee in tithes
[1:13:43] and offerings you are cursed with a
[1:13:45] curse for you robbed me even this whole
[1:13:48] nation bring ye all the tithes into the
[1:13:52] storehouse that there might be meat in
[1:13:54] my own house
[1:13:57] and prove me now
[1:13:59] therewith we want to be performers of
[1:14:02] the word don't we I love when you study
[1:14:04] out the Hebrew of this word prove me it
[1:14:07] is it is pronounced beon which means to
[1:14:10] prove I love studying out the Greek and
[1:14:13] Hebrew it gives you a different Dynamic
[1:14:15] of the word it it means to investigate
[1:14:18] it means to examine it means to prove it
[1:14:21] means to tempt it means to try
[1:14:26] so God says bring all your tithes into
[1:14:28] the storehouse that there might be meat
[1:14:30] in my house and investigate me and temp
[1:14:34] me and examine me now we got a chief
[1:14:38] investigator right here in the house
[1:14:40] tonight and I I when you begin to
[1:14:42] investigate you've got to turn over over
[1:14:45] every corner you got to turn over every
[1:14:48] corner when you begin to investigate
[1:14:50] because you don't want to miss any
[1:14:52] detail and God says God is saying go
[1:14:55] throughout all the testimonies in the
[1:14:57] land and investigate me see if I won't
[1:15:01] back up my word try me with it one time
[1:15:04] T me with it one time I put me on
[1:15:08] trial put me on trial and see if I will
[1:15:12] not open unto you the windows of heaven
[1:15:14] and pour out a blessing that there shall
[1:15:17] not be room enough to receive
[1:15:19] it if we want to be performers of the
[1:15:22] word we want to align our s with all the
[1:15:26] word and if somebody has taught you that
[1:15:29] you don't have to pay TI it's a false
[1:15:33] teaching and it's not matching up to the
[1:15:35] message of the
[1:15:38] hour what are you saying brother Angel
[1:15:40] I'm saying that if you've got the Holy
[1:15:42] Ghost if you've got the Holy Ghost then
[1:15:45] you will perfectly line up to all the
[1:15:47] word of
[1:15:50] God I personally I'm just lining some
[1:15:53] scriptures out I don't have I don't have
[1:15:55] intentions here I'm just lining
[1:15:56] scriptures out I got more to go but I
[1:15:59] personally don't want to be identified
[1:16:00] with anybody in business or in preaching
[1:16:03] or in music or in teaching or anybody
[1:16:05] that is willing to Rob god of what is
[1:16:08] rightfully his I'll be honest I'll be de
[1:16:11] honest with you if brother William if
[1:16:13] all these brothers that that we come
[1:16:14] here that are we allowed to preach if
[1:16:16] they're not tithes payers we don't want
[1:16:18] them behind this popit because God has
[1:16:20] already cursed him
[1:16:26] if you got the Holy Ghost you want to be
[1:16:27] a performer of the
[1:16:30] word that right we want to be performers
[1:16:32] of the
[1:16:33] word then there's a whole there's a
[1:16:36] whole scheme of things that people say
[1:16:38] that we shouldn't do those things no
[1:16:40] more but we want to be performers of the
[1:16:42] word of God right we want to match up to
[1:16:45] what Peter preached we want to match up
[1:16:48] to what Paul preached we want to match
[1:16:50] up to what the scripture said and Jesus
[1:16:53] said in Mark 16 and 15 go you into all
[1:16:56] the world and preach the gospel to Every
[1:16:59] Creature perform my word he that
[1:17:02] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:17:05] and he that believeth sh and but he that
[1:17:08] believeth not shall be damned be a
[1:17:10] performer of the word and these signs
[1:17:13] shall follow them that believe in mine
[1:17:17] in my name shall they cast out Devils
[1:17:19] they shall speak with new tongues be a
[1:17:22] performer of the word
[1:17:28] I gave man you don't talking about in
[1:17:30] tongues brother Andrew but back off him
[1:17:32] ties just a little bit be a performer of
[1:17:34] the
[1:17:35] word and you shall take up serpents be a
[1:17:39] performer of the word and if they drink
[1:17:41] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[1:17:43] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:17:46] they shall recover let me say if Paul
[1:17:49] laid hands on the sick then I got a
[1:17:51] right to lay hands on the sick if Peter
[1:17:53] laid hands on the sick then I've got a
[1:17:55] right to lay hands on the
[1:17:57] sick come on somebody if Mary spoke in
[1:18:01] tongues then I've got a right to speak
[1:18:03] in tongues if David danced then I've got
[1:18:06] a right to
[1:18:09] Dance come on somebody if Jeremiah said
[1:18:13] I would not speak no more but it was
[1:18:15] like fire shut up in my
[1:18:17] bones then let's be a performer of the
[1:18:20] word
[1:18:21] [Music]
[1:18:25] now be a Christian to be a
[1:18:27] Christian is real simple is to be
[1:18:31] Christlike another man I'm going lay
[1:18:33] some things here in the saman church
[1:18:37] age is it okay if I go Treacher on y'all
[1:18:40] just a minute that's part teacher part
[1:18:43] preacher he said now here is my point
[1:18:46] we'll see how well I do with this now
[1:18:48] here is my point he said to many of our
[1:18:50] modernist and even our fundamentalist
[1:18:53] so-called believe on salvation at a
[1:18:55] certain specific time in which many is
[1:18:58] called making a decision that has been
[1:19:01] called receiving Christ of being born
[1:19:03] again now to receive Christ is to
[1:19:06] receive his Spirit to receive his spirit
[1:19:08] is to be born
[1:19:10] again I love how simple I love how
[1:19:13] simple he tells this is as men that want
[1:19:16] to make it so
[1:19:17] complicated he said but to receive his
[1:19:20] spirit is to be born again to receive
[1:19:22] his spirit is to be baptized with the
[1:19:23] Holy Ghost amen these folks believe he
[1:19:26] said that's wonderful he said but they
[1:19:28] stopped there he said you receive the
[1:19:30] Holy Ghost after you believe you see
[1:19:34] when Peter stood up there on the day of
[1:19:36] Pentecost and he took them he took them
[1:19:39] to Acts 2:38 and he told them and gave
[1:19:42] them by Revelation the prescription on
[1:19:45] how to receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:19:46] Ghost he got these directions and those
[1:19:50] directions came as a direct answer from
[1:19:53] Peter relative to what actually happened
[1:19:55] at
[1:19:57] Pentecost so he gave these directions by
[1:20:00] Revelation by what happened at Pentecost
[1:20:03] they had believed they had received the
[1:20:05] word and they were up there waiting on
[1:20:08] it they believed it then they received
[1:20:11] it he said what came to pass was that
[1:20:14] God according to Joel was pouring out
[1:20:16] the promised Holy Spirit upon All
[1:20:20] Flesh he was he was not poured out
[1:20:22] before that time or given even before
[1:20:25] that time this was it but this was to
[1:20:29] come from now on by repenting and being
[1:20:33] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:37] Christ then God was Duty bound to fill
[1:20:40] the ones who
[1:20:43] came from now on to receive the baptism
[1:20:47] of the Holy Ghost you have to repent and
[1:20:49] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:20:51] Jesus Christ and then God and then God
[1:20:56] and then God was Duty bound to fill the
[1:20:58] ones who came Peter or any other
[1:21:00] Apostles never said you must be born
[1:21:03] again and then filled with the
[1:21:07] spirit that this is the pattern of
[1:21:10] experience relative to receiving the
[1:21:13] Holy Spirit note carefully the very next
[1:21:16] time that the spirit fell upon the
[1:21:17] people was in Acts chap 8 verse 5 I just
[1:21:21] going to skip through this chapter real
[1:21:23] quick but the Bible say
[1:21:25] then verse 5 then Philip went down to
[1:21:27] the city of Samaria and preached Christ
[1:21:29] unto them verse 12 said but when they
[1:21:32] believed Philip preaching the things
[1:21:34] concerning the kingdom of God and the
[1:21:36] name of Jesus Christ they were baptized
[1:21:39] both men and women they' heard the word
[1:21:43] it had been preached they believed on it
[1:21:46] then they were baptized verse 14 and
[1:21:48] when the apostles which were at
[1:21:50] Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[1:21:53] received the word they sent unto them
[1:21:56] Peter and John who when they were come
[1:21:59] down prayed for them that they might
[1:22:01] receive the Holy Ghost for it has yet it
[1:22:05] for for as yet he was Fallen upon none
[1:22:08] of them only they were baptized in the
[1:22:11] name of the Lord Jesus so according to
[1:22:13] verse 12 they believed the word they
[1:22:16] were then baptized in the name of the
[1:22:18] Lord Jesus but according to verse 16 in
[1:22:21] spite of all of that they had still not
[1:22:24] received re the Holy Spirit it was only
[1:22:27] after believing and being baptized
[1:22:30] correctly that they received the Holy
[1:22:32] Ghost that is the exact pattern as set
[1:22:36] forth by Peter in Acts 2 and
[1:22:40] 38 there's not one scripture in all the
[1:22:43] Bible where the disciples or the
[1:22:45] apostles baptized in any other name but
[1:22:49] by the name of
[1:22:51] Jesus like my granddaddy Homer said if
[1:22:54] you can find it in the scripture where
[1:22:56] GE where his disciples or Jesus baptized
[1:22:59] in any other way he said rip that page
[1:23:02] out put it some mayonnaise on it and
[1:23:04] I'll eat it right in front of you give
[1:23:06] you the deed to my house give you the

[1:24:41] there and hunt he said I want my own
[1:24:43] experience I want my own experience I
[1:24:46] don't want to just talk about Paul's
[1:24:47] preaching I don't want to just talk
[1:24:49] about Peter's preaching I don't want to
[1:24:51] just talk about William brandom's
[1:24:52] preaching I don't want to just talk
[1:24:54] about Homer phaser I don't want to just
[1:24:56] talk about Mark Spencer Ron Spencer
[1:24:58] Charlie Spencer Ed Bisal I want my own
[1:25:02] experience and when we have a personal
[1:25:07] experience it lines up with the word of
[1:25:10] God then all of Heaven is there to back
[1:25:13] up what he
[1:25:17] spoke he said it I believe it that
[1:25:20] settles
[1:25:22] it the Bible said in numbers 15 and 38
[1:25:25] that there that they would have that
[1:25:28] they would have fringes around the
[1:25:30] garments blue fringes that would hang
[1:25:32] around the garments and you begin to
[1:25:34] read in Matthew chapter 9 and 20 about a
[1:25:36] woman with a blood issue that she comes
[1:25:39] in there and she she's had this Blood
[1:25:41] issue for 12 years she's had this Blood
[1:25:44] issue with 12 years went to every doctor
[1:25:46] spent everything that she had but she
[1:25:48] doesn't had enough and she knew what the
[1:25:51] had Hallelujah she knew what the
[1:25:53] scripture said that she had no right to
[1:25:55] be there but it was her last dit
[1:25:57] desperate desperation effort that she
[1:25:59] was going to do and she wed through the
[1:26:02] crowd and touched the Hem of His Garment
[1:26:05] and immediately Mark said that her blood
[1:26:07] issue was dried
[1:26:10] up well you start reading Matthew
[1:26:13] chapter 14 that Jesus starts doing
[1:26:15] Miracles he starts feeding the 5,000 he
[1:26:18] starts feeding the 4,000 and there's a
[1:26:20] multitude that is following him and
[1:26:22] before long Jesus his Fame is going
[1:26:25] before himself before he can ever get
[1:26:27] there he's already there you know what
[1:26:30] I'm saying you know what I'm saying
[1:26:33] before he ever got here he was already
[1:26:35] here before the preacher ever got in the
[1:26:37] pulit he was already here are you with
[1:26:40] me are you hearing what I'm saying so
[1:26:43] before Jesus ever got into the city
[1:26:44] where they were his Fame had went before
[1:26:47] him and the Bible said they brought to
[1:26:49] him lame hot diseased and they came and
[1:26:53] the multitude just heard they'd heard
[1:26:56] about this woman in Matthew chapter
[1:26:59] n and the Bible said that there was many
[1:27:03] that pressed through the crowd just to
[1:27:05] Touch the Hem of His Garment the fame of
[1:27:08] this woman that had matched the faith of
[1:27:10] numbers
[1:27:13] 15 they'd heard about it they' heard
[1:27:16] about it and they realized that if she
[1:27:18] could do it then we can do it
[1:27:21] too you hear what I'm saying to you come
[1:27:24] on if Georgie Carter could do
[1:27:26] it come on somebody if Enoch could do it
[1:27:30] then I can do it if Elijah could get on
[1:27:32] a chariot and take off then I can do it
[1:27:35] come on somebody if Peter walked on
[1:27:37] water then I can do
[1:27:39] it Hallelujah if Peter could go through
[1:27:42] sicks and none of them things moved him
[1:27:45] then I can do
[1:27:46] it don't you tell me he can't do it
[1:27:49] don't you tell me that I can't I done
[1:27:51] seen too many vindications in the word
[1:27:54] of God that proved to me that he still
[1:27:56] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:27:59] and

[1:33:02] strain you'll be able to find
[1:33:03] it brother bar starts talking about this
[1:33:06] talking about this situation that this
[1:33:08] boy had done he'd walked away from a
[1:33:10] relationship and he wouldn't apologize
[1:33:12] about it he was wrong in the situation
[1:33:14] he wouldn't he wouldn't apologize for it
[1:33:17] brother marom starts going in there he
[1:33:18] said some of these things he said
[1:33:19] they're he said they're hard to say he
[1:33:21] said but they're true he said you've got
[1:33:22] to be honest in all the things and he
[1:33:24] said he said you look at the strain in
[1:33:26] that family he said that mother he said
[1:33:27] she's real she's real German he said
[1:33:29] nothing against German people he said he
[1:33:31] said but there's a strain there in them
[1:33:33] German people and he said they'll just
[1:33:34] sit there and they'll stare at you and
[1:33:36] they won't say a word and I'm afraid we
[1:33:38] got a whole lot of German Christians sit
[1:33:41] there and look at you in the face won't
[1:33:42] say nothing won't say Amen I'm sorry
[1:33:45] that fit too
[1:33:46] good he said but she he said she'd just
[1:33:49] sit there and not say a word to you or
[1:33:50] anything like that and the daddy was an
[1:33:52] Irish man hi tempered High strong and he
[1:33:55] said now he said he said now this boy as
[1:33:57] a Believer he said as a Believer he'd
[1:33:59] been he'd repented he'd B been baptized
[1:34:02] he said but he not received the baptism
[1:34:05] of the Holy Ghost he said now brother
[1:34:07] Ram goes in here and lays some very
[1:34:09] powerful things he said now thinking you
[1:34:11] got the Holy Ghost and having the Holy
[1:34:13] Ghost is two different things he said
[1:34:16] just because you have the emotions of
[1:34:17] the spirit of dancing and speaking in
[1:34:19] tongues and shouting and Sensations and
[1:34:21] running and jumping he said him think
[1:34:23] are all right he said but just to have
[1:34:25] that ain't enough you see you've got to
[1:34:28] have a life to back it up come on
[1:34:31] somebody that devil ain't scared when
[1:34:32] you jump that devil ain't scared when
[1:34:34] you shout that devil ain't scared when
[1:34:36] you get get
[1:34:37] Sensational it blesses you and it
[1:34:39] blesses God but that devil ain't scared
[1:34:41] about it that devil ain't scared about
[1:34:43] it unless there's a life there to back
[1:34:45] it up but when there's a life to back up
[1:34:48] your dance and a life to back up your
[1:34:51] shout and a life to back up your
[1:34:53] sensation
[1:34:54] then there's not a devil in hell that
[1:34:56] can rock you off of your experience by
[1:34:59] the word of
[1:35:01] God brother man would would lay in there
[1:35:03] about the the strain of this boy of his
[1:35:06] family that that his German nature and
[1:35:08] his Irish nature and he said that father
[1:35:10] is his family nature was high strung he
[1:35:13] said they was drunk he said they was he
[1:35:15] said they was high tempered they were
[1:35:16] high strung he said and you start
[1:35:18] searching those things out he said you
[1:35:21] look at it he said the parents of that
[1:35:22] boy the the jeans were laying there and
[1:35:25] brother brandham says this about them
[1:35:27] parents he said them parents had the
[1:35:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said but
[1:35:32] them jeans he said them complexes that
[1:35:35] was there in the strain of that boy's
[1:35:38] life he said even though his parents had
[1:35:41] the Holy Ghost he said that boy still
[1:35:44] dealt with that complex of the flesh it
[1:35:47] shows that God is no
[1:35:50] granddaddy that he you have to be a
[1:35:52] child of the word of God God that you've
[1:35:54] got to have a personal experience by a
[1:35:58] birth by a new generation by a new birth
[1:36:01] is that
[1:36:03] right he said but you look he he's
[1:36:05] talking to the parents he said now you
[1:36:06] look he said you look at your life he
[1:36:08] said you was you was this way you was
[1:36:10] high-tempered you were high strong he
[1:36:12] said but what gave you that forgiving
[1:36:14] and loving spirit that you got he said
[1:36:16] it's the Holy Spirit he said look at
[1:36:18] your family he said they'll just stare
[1:36:20] at you and look at you in the face he
[1:36:22] said but what gives you that nature he
[1:36:23] said it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:26] and brother random starts dealing with
[1:36:27] this boy he said even in his intellects
[1:36:30] he said he can't over coming and the
[1:36:32] daddy got you know how daddy does gets a
[1:36:35] little bit up well my boys done been to
[1:36:37] the altar I'm quoting the prophet he
[1:36:39] said my boy's been to the altar my boy's
[1:36:41] been baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:36:42] Christ correctly he said that might be
[1:36:44] so he said but he's never went all the
[1:36:47] way yet he never received the baptism of
[1:36:50] the Holy Ghost yet he said he's simply
[1:36:52] trying to overcome he's simply trying to
[1:36:54] overcome that complex in his own
[1:36:57] intellect he said he said until he said
[1:37:01] until he's regenerated and born again he
[1:37:03] said I'd advise that young man to never
[1:37:05] marry a woman he'll make hell on Earth
[1:37:07] for her until that gentle sweet
[1:37:09] forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in him
[1:37:13] he said but when it does he said that
[1:37:16] will be a paradox in itself to take the
[1:37:18] very nature of a boy that's bred between
[1:37:21] a mother and a father and Y and his
[1:37:22] intellects trying the best to overcome
[1:37:24] it he can't do it he'll never overcome
[1:37:26] it he said but Christ will overcome it
[1:37:29] for him when he lets Christ in then he's
[1:37:32] already overcame
[1:37:35] it well how do you overcome brother
[1:37:37] Andrew you got to keep life in
[1:37:41] you you got to keep life in you you
[1:37:44] can't be here you can't be on fire for
[1:37:47] God today and out of fire for God
[1:37:49] tomorrow you got to keep the life of the
[1:37:52] Holy Ghost
[1:37:54] remember when brother man was talking
[1:37:55] about how can I overcome and he's
[1:37:57] walking down that hill and he goes
[1:37:58] across that log he said it's a fine
[1:38:00] looking log he said it it fell down was
[1:38:02] laying there in the water he said but he
[1:38:04] said on the outside he said it looked
[1:38:06] perfectly good he said but down on the
[1:38:09] inside of it he said I jumped up on it
[1:38:11] and a great big chunk fell off of it he
[1:38:13] said what was it he said it had laid
[1:38:15] there in that water and had became dead
[1:38:17] and Dodie and had let the life go out of
[1:38:20] it he said it's proof right there how to
[1:38:23] over come is to keep the life on the
[1:38:25] inside of
[1:38:26] you what are you saying brother Andrew
[1:38:29] I'm saying this that to overcome famine
[1:38:32] you've got to stay in
[1:38:35] Feast come on now Amos 8 And1 tells us
[1:38:38] that the Bible says hallelujah that the
[1:38:42] Bible said that there will be a famine
[1:38:44] in the last days not for bread and water
[1:38:46] but it'll be for the very word of God
[1:38:49] but you're not in famine Church you're
[1:38:52] living in the Feast of the son of man
[1:38:55] where you're feeding daily on the
[1:38:57] unfailing body
[1:39:03] word
[1:39:06] hallelujah part three is
[1:39:08] coming God bless you would you stand
[1:39:10] with
[1:39:16] me I get to do that I'm a pastor
[1:39:25] if I was a if I was an evangelist I'd
[1:39:27] roll the whole whole Bell of hay out
[1:39:29] there for
[1:39:30] you but I'm a pastor and I realize that
[1:39:33] some of y'all can only endure what the
[1:39:35] backside can endure so God bless you do
[1:39:39] you love the Lord with all your
[1:39:48] heart I heard the prophet singing a song
[1:39:51] on the way to church he's actually the
[1:39:52] one that taught me out sing a
[1:39:56] song give me K
