[8:14] with the Word of God that he has to
[8:16] leave the Bible tells us to submit
[8:18] ourselves therefore to God and resist

[8:42] congregation abundantly and may we see
[8:44] the acts of the Holy Ghost moving
[8:46] amongst us here this evening
[8:48] may the Spirit of God fill just
[8:51] absolutely welcomed here
[8:53] may there be such a Liberty in this
[8:55] place tonight to move in any way
[8:57] possible may you minister in Jesus
[9:00] Christ's name Amen god bless you you may
[9:03] be seated in the presence of the Lord
[9:08] the brothers have that quote was shared
[9:11] with them said if if God designed man's
[9:17] body
[9:19] he certainly designed the body of his
[9:22] son the church he designed to us to come
[9:25] together in heavenly places in Christ
[9:27] Jesus and have the supernatural workings
[9:31] of God outlets through gifts of the
[9:34] Spirit such as prophecy and wisdom and
[9:36] knowledge and and gifts of healing and
[9:39] all of these other different gifts as
[9:41] outlets that God lets out his power and
[9:43] lets out his revelation to the people
[9:46] and not as an individual so much but as
[9:48] a unit we're all together one great body
[9:52] of believers and how do we get into this
[9:55] body in the mystic body of the Lord
[9:57] Jesus by one spirit we're all baptized
[10:00] into this body now notice this now Satan
[10:03] by the laws of sin and death makes
[10:05] everything that sin and death brought
[10:08] operate to sin that's through Satan's
[10:11] sins a cancer to operate to Satan and he
[10:14] sends a cancer the man recognized it
[10:17] receives it Satan sends heartaches we
[10:20] recognize it and receive it and if Satan
[10:23] by his power can make his laws work in a
[10:26] man how much more art God with his power
[10:29] make his laws work in man if Satan can
[10:32] make his laws be sure and us recognize
[10:35] it how much more God to his children to
[10:38] make his laws be recognized amongst his
[10:40] people of divine healing and revelation
[10:44] and power and gifts and manifestations
[10:46] of the Spirit the law of sin and death
[10:49] works in the people and the law of the
[10:52] Liberty of Christ has come unto us to
[10:55] set us free from those things if man can
[10:59] recognize what God has done
[11:01] how much more as the children of God's
[11:04] would do
[11:05] recognize what God has done what what
[11:07] God has given us if these things are
[11:09] laying there for us if these things are
[11:12] promised for us how much more should we
[11:14] recognize it this is this is not just a
[11:17] battle that we're facing this is not
[11:19] just a battle that you're facing this is
[11:22] a this is an attack all the way around
[11:24] the bride of Jesus Christ and if we can
[11:27] realize that that this is Satan at work
[11:29] this is this is the best that he's got
[11:32] this is the best that Satan as God is -
[11:37] to make you sick he's his best is to
[11:40] make you afflicted but the least little
[11:42] touch of God is omnipotent the best that
[11:45] Satan is God is the best that he's got
[11:48] but the least little thing of God
[11:50] tonight can cast Satan out my finger if
[11:54] we could begin to recognize our position
[11:58] and who we are and what we're put here
[12:00] for you were not put here to live in
[12:02] defeat but you are put here as a mighty
[12:05] jin-tae warrior bride to overtake and to
[12:09] overthrow Satan's Kingdom and do with it
[12:14] as you please
[12:15] [Music]
[12:17] hallelujah now the Bible says in
[12:19] Ephesians 1 and 18 that the eyes of your
[12:22] understanding being lightened that you
[12:25] may know what is the hope of his calling
[12:26] and what the riches of the glory of his
[12:29] inheritance in the Saints and what is
[12:32] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[12:36] us word who believe according to the
[12:39] working of his mighty power now I
[12:42] absolutely love the book of Ephesians it
[12:46] is personally my favorite book in the
[12:48] Bible I have spent much time there
[12:50] because that is a parallel to the book
[12:52] of Joshua it is our inheritance here we
[12:55] are here Paul is laying out to us our
[12:58] inheritance of of who we are these are
[13:00] our borders this is where we work at
[13:03] this is where we live at and I love what
[13:06] Paul said here that this exceeding
[13:08] greatness of his power to us were to
[13:10] believe according to the working of his
[13:13] mighty power which he wrought in Christ
[13:16] when he raised him from the dead and set
[13:18] him at his own right hand in heavenly
[13:20] places
[13:21] notice far above all principality above
[13:25] every angel above every demonic power
[13:27] and power and might and Dominion and
[13:30] every name that is named not a notices
[13:34] that not only in this world but also in
[13:37] that which is to come and hath put all
[13:40] things line up everything he got line up
[13:43] everything Satan's got line up
[13:45] everything the world's God has put all
[13:48] things under his feet and gave him to be
[13:51] the head over all all things to the
[13:55] church that word over in the Greek it is
[13:58] very chiefest it is beyond it is
[14:00] exceedingly abundantly that he is the
[14:04] head the very chiefest over all things
[14:06] that he is beyond all things he is
[14:09] exceedingly abundantly above all things
[14:12] to the church which is his body the
[14:15] fullness of him that filleth all in all
[14:18] you see God loves he loves to show his
[14:21] power he loves to manifest his goodness
[14:24] and his truth and His grace and His
[14:26] wisdom that's one thing as a believer
[14:28] you found about God is that God loves to
[14:31] display his power but not only does he
[14:34] love to display it about himself he
[14:36] loves as a as a great big God that can
[14:40] come all the way down to humanity
[14:43] you see that's what makes him not to me
[14:46] he's so great but yet he became become
[14:49] so small that he feels all time space
[14:52] and eternity but yet he wants to live on
[14:55] the inside of these 16 elements and he
[14:58] wants to show his power his glory his
[15:01] wisdom his truth his goodness hallelujah
[15:04] his holiness his purity his justice
[15:08] hallelujah
[15:09] God's not somewhere far off up in heaven
[15:12] deities in you and if you can realize
[15:15] the day that heaven is not that far away
[15:18] but heaven is on the inside of you come
[15:21] on somebody a lot of people will look at
[15:23] the seals they look at this
[15:25] well I don't understand all these things
[15:26] let me give it to you straight the
[15:28] revealing of the seals is not just some
[15:31] book it is Christ and if you can ever
[15:36] get that figured out that in this day
[15:38] Christ has been revealed to you this is
[15:42] not God way back there back some back is
[15:44] some of the eggs this is God right now
[15:47] this is Jesus revealed to you this is
[15:52] the son of man that is continuing to
[15:54] speak Tom time and time again and he's
[15:58] still speaking any Bible reader and who
[16:02] reads the Bible knows that God loves to
[16:04] display his power another man have said
[16:07] that he brings men into situations that
[16:09] they cannot figure out in order to show
[16:12] them that he loves him and he leads them
[16:17] who he loves to display his power he
[16:21] displayed his power when Daniel used the
[16:25] Lions hard to lay down the pole are you
[16:28] with me he displayed his power when
[16:32] there was a little ruddy boy that
[16:33] overtook a giant he displayed his power
[16:36] there he displayed his power and the man
[16:40] called Jesus when he was away was weary
[16:43] from the revival before and he stepped
[16:46] up on the brow of the boat and he stood
[16:49] up there and he said peace be still
[16:53] hallelujah and he's dead he displayed
[16:55] his power in front of his disciples and
[16:58] the same one is speaking today if he
[17:02] could stand upon that natural boat how
[17:05] much more can he stand upon your
[17:07] spiritual boat this evening
[17:09] why don't you let the son of man begin
[17:12] to speak peace to your situation peace
[17:15] to your life peace to your home peace to
[17:19] your family peace to your marriage he's
[17:22] willing hallelujah you look at Israel in
[17:27] their journey which was a type of this
[17:28] of this journey today how notice how he
[17:32] would lead them right into death
[17:34] strap who that's swallow that one it's
[17:39] good for you then display is power he
[17:43] led them into deathtrap and then he
[17:45] displayed his power when notice when
[17:48] Pharaoh would say I will let them go and
[17:52] then God says no no I'm going to harden
[17:59] his heart just in order to show his
[18:03] great power I love what brother Marsh
[18:10] said last night if it would not have
[18:12] been a fire if God would have saved the
[18:14] three Hebrew children before the fire
[18:16] you'd have never heard of them if God
[18:18] would have saved us from everything we
[18:21] that we would have went through in life
[18:23] we'd have never known him in his
[18:25] attributes as a savior but because He
[18:30] loves us he leads us in the spots where
[18:34] he can display his glory because he
[18:40] loves me whoo hallelujah in order to
[18:45] show his great power I believe that's
[18:47] why that God is letting things happen
[18:49] the way they are today that when the
[18:51] great rush finally comes he loves to
[18:54] show his power and display his love to
[18:57] the sons of men and the conflict between
[19:02] God and Satan he said but Satan is more
[19:05] than a match for us
[19:06] we know we know that Satan is way more
[19:11] than a match for any human being don't
[19:16] you never try to do it with your wisdom
[19:19] to outsmart him you just can't do it
[19:22] and Jesus knew this so he sent to the
[19:25] church that Satan would not outsmart
[19:28] them he sent them a place to be
[19:31] fortified he sent them the Holy Ghost
[19:35] and the Church does not claim to be
[19:37] smart they just claim to believe it you
[19:41] see if you could ever figure out that
[19:43] Satan is not scared of your 16 elements
[19:46] Satan is not scared
[19:47] your human flash Satan is not scared
[19:50] he's not scared of even your earthly
[19:53] spirit he's not scared of you in your
[19:56] flesh brother Nathanael but as a gene
[19:58] seed of God if you could ever realize as
[20:02] an Son of God that you've got more power
[20:05] than the Angels do in heaven Satan ain't
[20:09] scared of me as a Spencer but has a son
[20:12] of God he'd better not mess with me
[20:14] [Applause]
[20:21] hello you see in my human flesh he is
[20:25] more than a match for me but notice is
[20:29] in my genes seat of God I'm more than a
[20:34] match for him hallelujah
[20:39] if you don't believe me I'll give you a
[20:41] quote floor there are you standing this
[20:43] morning there stands the tracks of the
[20:44] Living God I don't care what anyone else
[20:47] says what the doctor says what anything
[20:49] what the unbelievers has won more than a
[20:52] match for anything that comes along
[20:55] where Abraham seed and we shall possess
[20:58] the gate of our enemy no matter what the
[21:02] enemy is God gave the promise that was
[21:05] theirs their possession healings your
[21:07] possession salvations your possession
[21:09] the Holy Ghost is your possession glory
[21:15] when Moses was there when the backside
[21:19] of a desert and he was there and had the
[21:21] pillar fire the burning bush experience
[21:22] and he began to speak - hello him and he
[21:26] says who will I say sit me tell them
[21:29] that I am that I am has sent me that I
[21:32] am the present one I'm an ever-present
[21:35] help in the time of trouble I'm there
[21:37] when you need me I'm there when you
[21:39] don't I'm always there I am his presence
[21:42] it's not past tense it's not future it's
[21:45] right now and they still the great I am
[21:50] when he was there with Moses he said I
[21:52] am when he was there and Jesus he said I
[21:54] am and when he was here in this day he
[21:57] said I am
[21:58] that I am he only changed his mask to
[22:03] empty himself are you with me to believe
[22:07] to a believer that would open up
[22:09] themselves and allow the Holy Ghost to
[22:12] come in brother Branham said that God's
[22:15] strategy is to take empty vessels and
[22:18] fill them up and shake hell with them
[22:24] alright who's willing to be an empty
[22:27] vessel this evening hallelujah now
[22:34] notice as we go on further in the book
[22:37] of Exodus we find that Moses goes down
[22:40] to each to take over we go down there
[22:42] and we find that that we found Moses
[22:45] here and then begins to display the
[22:47] power of God and the plagues and the
[22:49] power of God is being shown which I'm
[22:52] over to answer this chapter 9 in verse
[22:54] 13 and the Lord said unto Moses rise up
[22:57] early in the morning I'm not going to
[23:00] give you all the background but you just
[23:01] jump right in you know the story quite
[23:03] well but all these other plagues have
[23:06] taken place and now they're at this spot
[23:08] and the Moses is still before Pharaoh
[23:11] and say let my people go and and the
[23:14] Lord said unto Moses rise up early in
[23:16] the morning and stand before Pharaoh
[23:18] saying to him thus save the Lord God of
[23:20] the Hebrews let my people go that they
[23:23] may serve me notice there's a lot of
[23:27] people that are still bound because they
[23:30] do not want to come out and serve Him
[23:33] there's a lot of people that want to be
[23:35] healed there's a lot of people that want
[23:38] to be delivered and all they want is
[23:40] that but they don't want to come out and
[23:42] serve Him there have been countless
[23:45] times and that people will just pass
[23:48] through this church or pass through
[23:49] other churches and they they have a need
[23:52] in mind and they know that there is a
[23:55] balm in Gilead so they come to where
[23:57] they know that there's divine healing
[23:59] yet you remember that there was a lady
[24:01] that came here one time that had a brain
[24:03] aneurysm
[24:04] and she came here said a brain aneurysm
[24:07] and the doctors were surprised that she
[24:08] was even living and she came here and
[24:11] was actually asked if we would baptize
[24:13] her we had to be very delicate with the
[24:16] situation we baptized her annually she
[24:19] went back to the doctors and the brain
[24:22] aneurism was completely gone
[24:25] that's my god she reached out and
[24:29] touched God she got her healing and
[24:32] never came back
[24:33] we baptized somebody here some years ago
[24:37] now we they they had they had cancer
[24:40] they had heart trouble and they came
[24:42] here and they knew that they needed to
[24:44] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[24:45] Jesus Christ we baptize them in a watery
[24:48] grave and they then they rose rose up
[24:51] there the next week they went back to
[24:53] the doctor and cancer was gone and the
[24:55] heart trouble was gone they reached out
[24:58] just for a moment as Jesus was passing
[25:01] by and they touched him but they were
[25:04] not willing to serve him now if they
[25:08] could reach into that realm what about
[25:11] you as sons and daughters of God that
[25:14] are not just willing to be healed but
[25:16] willing to come out and serve Him
[25:18] willing to stand up for him oh I hate
[25:24] and I the things of God are limited to
[25:27] you if you can reach out my faith let me
[25:34] move on for our out this time verse 14
[25:38] for our at this time send all my plagues
[25:40] upon my heart and upon my servants and
[25:43] upon all upon my people that thou may us
[25:45] know that there is none like me and all
[25:48] the earth notice this is what Moses is
[25:51] saying to Pharaoh for now I will stretch
[25:54] out my hand then I might smite thee in
[25:58] my people with a pestilence and that
[26:01] thou shall be cut off from the earth now
[26:05] I absolutely love verse 16 I love it in
[26:11] such a way because this scripture right
[26:13] here will sake hail down
[26:18] he will make it will make it will make a
[26:21] police officer if he stops he be stops a
[26:24] car and he smells marijuana in the car
[26:26] he's got legal rights to search that car
[26:30] now if you read this scripture and you
[26:33] don't realize your legal rights that you
[26:35] got a right to shake hell down with you
[26:38] are not reading this scripture as it is
[26:40] said to you notice and in and in very
[26:44] deed for this cause have I raised the up
[26:49] for to show in the my power and that my
[26:53] name may be declared throughout all the
[26:56] earth has yet exalt is now myself
[26:58] against my people that thou will not let
[27:01] them go you know it's amazing when Hale
[27:05] thinks it's winning
[27:06] when Hale thinks that it's done decided
[27:09] that I'm not going to let them go
[27:11] they're my people I'm not gonna let them
[27:13] go and then Hale has to hear God say
[27:17] that I raised you up for a purpose I
[27:20] raised a role for a purpose I race
[27:23] cancer for a purpose
[27:25] I'm really outraged emergences for a
[27:28] purpose
[27:29] I rise sugar diabetes for a purpose my
[27:32] trouble for a purpose that my name might
[27:35] be glorified in all the earth
[27:38] Hale is got to recognize something big
[27:42] is coming and it's God hell I want you
[27:49] to hear me tonight you were raised for
[27:51] the call to glorify the name of Jesus
[27:55] you have no legal right to touch me
[28:03] hallelujah halo was raised for this cost
[28:08] oh that's got to be humiliating for the
[28:19] enemy when he really thinks he's got the
[28:23] upper hand on you and then to find out
[28:26] he was only raised for this cost that
[28:29] the name of Jesus whoo to show God's
[28:32] power to show his strength to show his
[28:36] testimony the think of this would not
[28:38] have happened if God would not have
[28:42] hardened Pharaoh's heart you would have
[28:44] never known these things if Anna just
[28:47] walked out if it had just walked out but
[28:50] because of this God's name was magnified
[28:53] and glorified if this wouldn't have
[28:55] happened that God always gets the glory
[28:58] he always gets the glory a lot of people
[29:01] don't want to profess anything and I
[29:03] don't believe in just letting negativity
[29:05] come across her lips but you ought to
[29:07] recognize the devil that you're fighting
[29:09] with and you can either say well I've
[29:11] got heart trouble or heart troubles got
[29:13] me or you can either say I got cancer or
[29:17] cancers got me I choose to say that is
[29:21] Full Gospel Light House
[29:22] we got cancer by the throat of the neck
[29:37] we ought to be bold in your worship you
[29:40] know who you are don't you be scared of
[29:43] him he's scared of you don't you get
[29:46] nervous he's nervous don't you get shook
[29:49] up he's shaken up when the weakest of
[29:51] Christians those on their knees
[29:54] he'll trembles what about you veterans
[29:59] what about your mamas and daddies let's
[30:02] shake hell down
[30:08] what coming to take over hallelujah
[30:18] hallelujah oh it imagine it's throughout
[30:28] the years there's hardly a service it's
[30:31] ever that's ever preached that the name
[30:33] Moses how are the children of Israel's
[30:35] not mentioned why because there was a
[30:38] miracle that took place brother Branham
[30:42] said before you can see a miracle you
[30:44] got to become a miracle but I want you
[30:46] to look at this in this way that that we
[30:49] point back to these miracles we point
[30:52] back and we realize that the god of
[30:54] Moses and the God of Abraham and the god
[30:56] of Isaac and the God of Jacob is still
[30:58] the same God but we point back to those
[31:01] miracles and think about the faith that
[31:03] it raised are you with me think about
[31:06] the faith that are raised in Rahab and
[31:08] all of Jericho was all scare but a habit
[31:11] release her faith that she could drop
[31:14] down a token oh come on help me preach
[31:17] tonight it brought faith to her that she
[31:20] realized that there was something out
[31:22] there in that camp that would get her
[31:25] hat of her pestilence that would get her
[31:28] out of her careers ever get her out of
[31:31] her prostitution she realized that they
[31:34] had something that she was lacking it
[31:38] was because of these miracles that
[31:40] Gideon would point back and say where if
[31:43] God be with us then where be all of his
[31:46] miracles he knew that he had to be the
[31:48] same God and if he was God then where is
[31:51] all of his miracles have and here Didius
[31:54] he's giving God the answer he's given
[31:57] him and presenting him this question and
[31:58] then God answers him because he was
[32:01] pointing back to a miracle that had
[32:04] happened and if you look at the children
[32:06] of Israel the children of Israel were
[32:08] trained by trouble it sculpted them and
[32:13] cultivated them and they learned how to
[32:15] fight but they were not just out beating
[32:18] at the air they were landing the
[32:21] the only time that they were beating at
[32:24] the air was when sin came into the camp
[32:26] and anybody can fight I said in a land
[32:30] full of Fighters anybody can fight but
[32:34] we're we're not talking about somebody
[32:36] that's just willing to roll up the
[32:37] sleeves here we're not talking about
[32:40] that anybody anybody in the right mind
[32:42] that knows knows better on in the
[32:45] natural would fight for him but we're
[32:48] not just looking for somebody that's
[32:49] willing to fight for him in the natural
[32:51] we're looking for somebody and when you
[32:54] win I want you to I want you to hear
[32:56] this every time you hear me say but
[32:57] they're wrong Spencer now I am NOT just
[33:00] addressing him I am addressing the I am
[33:04] addressing the issue because you see
[33:06] this is not just a battle against
[33:08] brother Ron Spencer this is a this is a
[33:11] battle against you this is a battle
[33:13] against the bride of Jesus and I hope
[33:16] you follow me in my in my thinking on
[33:18] that because you see this is more than
[33:21] just on one person this is affecting you
[33:24] this is affecting conventions this is
[33:27] affecting meetings this is affecting the
[33:30] world but we are not just dealing with a
[33:33] cancer in the flesh but we are fighting
[33:36] against an enemy that is trying to bring
[33:41] cancer to a generation to a people to
[33:45] grab a hold of him as the prophet would
[33:47] say and be a craft of him and drug the
[33:50] very life out of them that is what Satan
[33:53] is one to do don't look at the small
[33:55] picture look at the big picture of what
[33:57] Satan is trying to do he is trying to
[34:00] grab a hold of your spiritual life he is
[34:05] trying to grab a hold of you as an
[34:07] individual and destroy your family
[34:14] I got people in my in in my in my work
[34:21] for sir in the work community that would
[34:24] die for me that would die for Matthew in
[34:28] my dad in that in that realm because of
[34:31] what we mean to them I believe you've
[34:33] got friends like that that would
[34:35] actually give their life just defending
[34:37] you but you know in this type of battle
[34:40] you're not looking for somebody that
[34:43] knows how to pull out the brass knuckles
[34:45] you're looking for somebody that knows
[34:47] how to pool the house Hebrews chapter
[34:49] four and 12 they know how to pull out
[34:51] that sword they know how to get it and
[34:53] use it and they're not holding it by
[34:55] weekend they're holding it by straw head
[34:57] anybody can just spout off at the mouth
[35:00] a lot of people are real good at that
[35:02] a lot of people don't know when to shut
[35:04] that thing a lot of people don't know
[35:05] when to stop talking or stop typing they
[35:08] don't know when anybody can spout off at
[35:10] the mouth and anybody can quote logos
[35:13] but I'm looking for somebody that'll
[35:15] reach in there and grab that spiritual
[35:17] war like Hattie Wright's head and she
[35:19] said the right word are you with me
[35:22] tonight
[35:23] we're not fighting us in the natural
[35:24] were fighting us in a supernatural and a
[35:27] vein a spiritual realm this is not a
[35:32] natural battle this is a spiritual
[35:34] battle buckle it up it's time for battle
[35:41] it's a time to land punches realize that
[35:45] we're engaged in a warfare anybody can
[35:48] say they got faith but let that faith
[35:50] speak let that faith go to work faith is
[35:54] works Express you can have faith but let
[35:56] it loose let that faith loose that that
[36:01] faith speak let that faith move you
[36:06] remember brother Branham he had that old
[36:08] dog come fritz
[36:09] he said he'd chase everything now he
[36:13] said he'd chase everything down but he
[36:14] would not chase telescope he said he'd
[36:17] get up here and he'd chase after and
[36:19] he'd get him up in a bush but he would
[36:20] not go in there her brother branham he
[36:22] said now he said I would say sick and
[36:24] Fritz and he'd run right in there
[36:27] and he'd go after that skunk you're in
[36:30] wrath
[36:30] he said go in there get him fritz sick
[36:33] in French sick and fritz he said now the
[36:36] biggest devil the biggest cook that I
[36:38] know of is the devil
[36:40] and he said when I hear people say a
[36:42] name man go for it
[36:44] go after him he said it shows to me that
[36:47] we've got the devil treed and it's just
[36:52] a sword moment we've got entry tonight
[36:59] my Magic's proven to me that you've got
[37:03] the devil tree you've got him in a
[37:06] corner a man sick and broad go after him
[37:13] prod
[37:14] [Applause]
[37:27] it's a time to let God loose on the
[37:30] enemy it's a time to let the great I am
[37:34] loose on him
[37:36] a lot of times people got God boxed up
[37:39] in their mentality of their of their
[37:41] mind that God's got to do this before it
[37:43] can do that or God's gotta move on this
[37:45] way before he can move that if you as a
[37:47] human being
[37:49] listen maybe it's just works in my mind
[37:52] if you can get him out well God's got to
[37:54] do this and God's got to do that and
[37:56] God's got to make this happen before I
[37:58] see the miracle if you could take God
[38:00] out of your little man-made box take him
[38:04] out of that box and say God you're the
[38:07] god of help you're the god of the
[38:09] universe
[38:10] you ain't gotta work to man mentality
[38:12] I'm gonna walk to your mentality and let
[38:15] God loose and you'll watch the miracle
[38:18] come to pass see you're standing in a
[38:26] position and I want you to realize where
[38:28] you're at in this battle that we're
[38:30] facing you are standing in a great
[38:33] position you're in a position as a
[38:36] people for God to reveal himself to you
[38:42] now Satan no mind you going to church he
[38:46] don't mind you coming here on Saturday
[38:48] and Sunday he don't mind you getting
[38:49] your car he don't even mind you turning
[38:51] on your gospel music he don't mind you
[38:53] flipping through the pages of the Bible
[38:55] he don't mind you joining the choir
[38:56] young people he don't mind you joining
[38:59] the choir he don't mind you getting
[39:02] emotional down here and getting happy he
[39:07] don't mind those things but when you
[39:08] start receiving the Lord for the hour
[39:11] that's where Satan gets all hot and
[39:14] bothered he starts having a heat flash
[39:18] and all my goodness he just can't keep
[39:21] cool down is when you start receiving
[39:23] the word for the hour who I'm preaching
[39:28] to every woman over 50 right now
[39:29] understand all of that but I want you to
[39:31] realize that when you start receiving
[39:33] the Lord for the hour and putting that
[39:35] word for the hour that's when
[39:37] he goes into a hot flash he starts
[39:40] realizing that there's of people that
[39:42] can fan the flames higher that could
[39:46] push him right back down the hill where
[39:49] he came from well I'm sure I'm gonna
[39:53] hear about that one you're standing in a
[39:58] position that God can reveal himself to
[40:01] you and Satan hates that you see Satan
[40:04] tried his very best to keep Joshua from
[40:06] going into the homeland he given false
[40:09] reports he brought up negative
[40:11] testimonies he brought out rumors of
[40:13] giants in that land but Joshua was not
[40:16] bothered by their by their negative
[40:18] testimonies Joshua was commissioned and
[40:23] verse just will won't involve this he'll
[40:25] not any man be able to stand before thee
[40:28] all the days of thy life as always with
[40:29] Moses who I will be with thee I will not
[40:31] fail thee nor forsake me
[40:34] Joshua was commissioned to stand there
[40:36] and to go in and take it over and Satan
[40:40] was doing his best to keep him out of
[40:41] that land because Satan knew that once
[40:44] Joshua got in he would not get him out I
[40:49] just dropped you a whole wheelbarrow
[40:52] load Satan knows if you get into this
[40:56] message he ain't gonna get you out of
[40:59] this message
[41:02] if you really dive in ain't no way he
[41:05] gonna get you out
[41:08] why don't you dive on here tonight
[41:12] Saints gone his best to keep the
[41:15] revealed word in this hour away from you
[41:18] [Applause]
[41:20] once you get in he ain't gettin you out
[41:30] that's why you see such a struggle with
[41:33] your family with your product course
[41:35] with your in-laws you see such a
[41:37] struggle because Satan is wanting to
[41:39] keep him out of it
[41:41] he may do his very best but if they Lord
[41:44] name before the foundation of the world
[41:46] he can do all he wants to to him once
[41:49] they give in he can't get him out my
[42:03] Jesus let me just let me just transition
[42:15] here I feel I feel Liberty to go here so
[42:18] we're going wait how wait for these
[42:21] moments and now is the time I was
[42:25] listening to the Prophet the other day
[42:26] and he said there's a little lady as a
[42:29] little lady he was playing with a little
[42:31] lady he said you were just back there
[42:33] wondering when it was your time he said
[42:37] but now's your time now's your time
[42:41] you may be wondering when it's your time
[42:43] to get the sword out and start cutting
[42:46] it down now it tells you by the Spirit
[42:49] of the Lord now is your time you have to
[42:52] wait no more

[42:56] trees rise rise

[43:03] your book it's not a closed book it's an
[43:06] open book eat this book become this book

[43:13] of you but keep pushing it down it's
[43:17] this word that will whip the devil
[43:19] anytime anyplace under any condition I
[43:37] got a phone call from my buddy

[43:59] I want it in my spirit so that when Hale
[44:02] comes against us you say I may forget it
[44:05] but there was an anointing that comes
[44:07] that will bring it out at your need and

[46:55] spine fuse and the Lord came down and
[46:58] healed them instantly during the
[47:00] preaching of the word what about you

[50:34] realm that cancer is challenging the
[50:37] bride of Jesus Christ I'm talking about
[50:40] the crab cancer that is trying to
[50:43] destroy that cancer is trying to reach
[50:46] out and challenge the ministry of Jesus
[50:50] Christ this is not attack on brother on
[50:53] this is an attack on the Ministry of
[50:55] Jesus Christ now I want you to hear me
[50:58] loud and clear right now that this is a
[51:01] showdown between God and Satan and there
[51:04] is his a realm of impossibilities but
[51:07] this is where God works at his best this
[51:11] is where God fights at its with his word
[51:14] with his anointing this is an attack on
[51:21] the Ministry of Jesus Christ you've got
[51:24] to get it off of your mind and realize
[51:26] that the battle is not about you the
[51:29] battle is the Lord's the battle belongs
[51:32] through the Lord and the battle is the
[51:36] Lord's and the Lord will win the battle
[51:38] but you still got to show up
[51:45] you still got to show up you know we're
[51:48] gonna win you know we're gonna be
[51:50] victorious you know we're gonna overcome
[51:53] but somebody's got to show up to the
[51:55] batter God is going to win this through
[51:59] you
[52:02] [Applause]
[52:08] but the musicians come sister Stephanie
[52:17] I know you love this but this is a
[52:21] stupid devil we're dealing with stupid I
[52:25] mean you've got to be an ignoramus to do
[52:28] this
[52:28] I mean God already defeated Satan
[52:32] he's already defeated cancer he's
[52:35] already defeated all of these things but
[52:38] now Satan is stupid enough to challenge
[52:41] back a stone you got beat ever since the
[52:49] beginning of time do you really think
[52:52] you're going to win now it's easy for us
[52:59] are all these huh it's easy for us to
[53:01] get another natural health but in the
[53:03] spiritual realm if you could see what
[53:04] I'm saying to you Satan has challenged
[53:08] and Satan will lose
[53:24] Satan will loose I'm gonna give you one
[53:29] more thing before I close a sister said
[53:33] this to me once during a war between
[53:37] Spain and France
[53:38] the Spaniards surrounded the French army
[53:41] and sent over a note to the French
[53:44] general which said surrender we have you
[53:48] outnumbered and surrounded sounds pretty
[53:53] much how Satan is trying to sound to us
[53:58] surrender we have you outnumbered and
[54:00] surrounded the french general wrote a
[54:03] reply fastened it to an arrow and shot
[54:07] it back into the spanish camp and it
[54:09] read surrender never we have our king
[54:14] with us why would we back up now why
[54:20] would we weigh the surrender flag now
[54:23] we've got a king with us surrender no
[54:30] way I'm King the Lord Jesus is in our
[54:36] camp he's a god that's mighty in battle
[54:39] he's never lost a battle he will not
[54:42] lose this war it will be Satan that
[54:47] waves a flag of surrender but as for us
[54:51] we'll be waving the flag of triumph and
[54:54] victory
