just have your seizures for a moment of time like to say good morning it's good to be gathered again in service in Virginia here with the saints of God that are here and we certainly do love you with all of our heart it's a real blessing to have sister Mara with me here this weekend she doesn't travel with me very much but when it comes to Virginia she's with me when we come here she just loves you all with all her heart and it's always a blessing to see the saints of God that are here Vernon Kathy God bless you it's always a pleasure to see you and sister Nancy certainly do love her with all of our heart she's just a real she's just a real queen of a lady and a real Christian Christian grandmother Christian mother amen our family back home with sends their loving greetings to each and every one of you as well Jonas Laura and Kelvin and Melody and all of our grandchildren they have a deep appreciation for her brother Ron and sister Connie and different ones that have traveled to our place and they wanted to be sure that I would give greetings and also our brother your sister Kay my brother Kenton and sister Lorraine who's been here and our church family they all send their heartfelt greetings to each and every one of you uh December 2019 it took sister maram I saw three days to arrive here that was probably the worst trip I've ever had in my life to be honest with you on a plane for all those hours and then they had to turn around and go back to Calgary and well we just we just hopped from one city to another until we finally were able to be here but it was a was a difficult trip when we were in Toronto they actually the person that was in charge there she told us you have no seats on this flight and there's we can't get you on a flight and I just indicated to her that I was going to Camp right by her desk until she found us some tickets to be able to get here and so we were able to find some tickets overnighted in Toronto and then brother Ron Brother Matt and brother Andrew came to the airport in Washington to pick us up from the airport and and be able to come here to be in service that Sunday night that we were here it was all my heart and and this coin that I had brought with me which was a war commemorative coin of Normandy with a pebble of sand embedded into it and uh it was something that to when brother Ron had seen it originally he was he was quite moved by it and I I was able to get another one and bring it with me and on that particular coin it said we will accept nothing less than full victory uh that Sunday afternoon we presented that coin to brother Ron which many of you were here when we did that and we brought a message titled full victory at that time and I believe that's what the Lord Was preparing us for preparing him for is for full victory he not realizing at that time that brother Ron was moving into an incredible battle and a very difficult Journey would begin and we just were part of that beginnings it was later last year May the 7th 2022 that we were able to come here which was something that we didn't know if that would ever happen again of course because of the pandemic but we were able to be here and I brought a statue with me of of David with his Goliath sword drawn with his foot on Goliath's head and I called that statue at that time and I still call it the same your enemy is dead and and I believe that with all my heart uh the the enemy our enemy Satan would try to take our lives if he could but there's one thing that we know for sure is that that he can't do anything unless God gives him the go-ahead to do it and therefore three years that it is right now brother Ron we're just so thrilled to be here together with brother Tim uh brother dawn in himself at that time coming I was encountered I wasn't able to make it at that time March of 2020 to be able to be here because it's a long a long trip and our Airlines were closing down but I'm happy to stand with with these Generals in the army of the Lord and and that they would come and pray and I always appreciated brother Tim's words that he spoke we shall see Miracles we shall see Giants fall I believe that's happening around the world we are seeing incredible Miracles I've heard of many miracles from your local assembly and many miracles from Brother Tim's assembly in our assembly there's many miracles that are transpiring and we know that it can only happen through the through faith in the word of God and and I I say it's a blessing one more time for sister Myra and myself to be here three years into this battle and I say the battle is not ours but the battle is the Lord's and he'll give us the Victory and we believe for brother Ron in his faith journey and we believe and expect nothing else but full Victory we believe that with all of our heart and we believe that giant is dead and we're just moving into that new body that the Lord will have for you our body that's full from all that cancer that you're dealing with amen we can save from our heart we love you dearly your prayer your name is on the top of our prayer request every single service and we just have a deep appreciation we we stand in faith together with this assembly Full Gospel Lighthouse and we stand together in faith with you and your family we love you all with all of our heart amen isn't the Lord he's good to us even in the darkest time and in the deepest battles the Lord certainly is good to us amen if you'd like to stand at this time I'm just going to read a scripture that I've been looking at at home for a while and I trust it'll be a blessing we had a wonderful time last night I hear that some people went home a little intoxicated of the spirit and while they got home there's one nice thing about it is that when you wake up in the morning you don't have a headache it kind of takes away all headaches it takes away all things and we thank the Lord for those kind of times amen had a brother who would contact me on a meeting we were having he said brother Kelly I made it home but we were pretty drunk on the way home I said as long as you keep it between the lines then you're doing okay amen that's the main thing is it wonderful the lord always gets us home we thank him for that Romans chapter 10 I'd like to read today if we could turn there verses 11 through 17. for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed or or shall not be disappointed there's no disappointment when you serve the Lord for there's no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord over all is Rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever and we believe we're part of that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord it's very affirmative they shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher so by the foolishness of preaching men shall be saved how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed our report so that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen God bless you you may have your seats this this morning if I would title my my my text this morning I would title it my Liberty my freedom My Liberty my freedom I'd like to read if you still have your Bibles open and in Romans 10 I'd like to read verses 16 through 17 out of the passion translation sometimes different translations just make the word just a little more colorful just brings it out just a little better for us than our English language he says but not everyone welcomes the good news Isaiah said Lord is there anyone who hears and believes our message and we could say this morning that we are I hear and we also believe the message that God has sent to us in this anti-mower verse 17 is very beautiful it says faith then his birth in a heart that responds to God's anointed utterance of the anointed one Faith then is birthed in a heart that responds to God's anointed utterance of the anointed ones when we speak of Liberty and we speak of Freedom that's something that can is only given to us by a new birth that we have received through our Lord Jesus Christ and God has purpose to give us Liberty in all parts of our life so when I was young I thought I had Liberty but when I really came into Christ that's when true Liberty became part of my fiber became a part of your fiber when we come into the into the Lord all the things that we at one time we thought were such joyful there also become they're so dead in our life and we have freedom from all those things that actually were destroying our very being back home in our country they're they they have legalized drugs and and all kinds of things that they've done now and and they're wondering why they're such a high suicide rate in this because the people are so intoxicated with chemical substances is that they can't think straight anymore and the world becomes such that is so depressed and they don't know which way to turn and they don't know what to do and you can talk to them about the Lord and seemingly there's just seem like there's a void part there and the part is true who hath heard our message there's is there anyone that would have faith to hear the message of the hour of today and and even though they they sometimes even will move to the spot where they can see that there's something there there's something that hindromes hinders them from actually accepting it I want to say this morning is that we have heard the message we've accepted the message we've received it and we put it into our heart and this message is changing us from glory to glory and and from from one level to another other level we're moving higher in the Lord continually in our walk with almighty God we can say that the Lord has been good to us amen that is true we're still in our human Veil and we get sick and we have disappointments and there's troubles within life but I'm so thankful that I have a place where I can bring my troubles to I'm thankful there's a place where I can bring him and lay him at the feet of the Lord Jesus and and he well he willingly takes them from me and and he gives us victory in in all of our battles there's not a battle that we have that the Lord is not part of the Lord is part of that battle sometimes he may allow things to come our way but he always leaves a way of Escape for us and a place where we can we can move into an element where we can have peace in our heart and joy in our soul and as brother Brown says sometimes we just need to put on our joy shoes on and be able to get happy in the Lord and happy with what God has done to us and be satisfied where what portion he has allotted to us in this life that we live today I say we have a lot of Liberty Liberty sometimes is is we want to get happy in the Lord and raise our hands but Liberty is actually not living as you would like to but it's living as God would have you to live that's really where true Liberty is true Liberty is something that I say Lord if I'm part of you and you're part of me then I've got Liberty to do whatever I want to do and there are just a lot of things I just don't care to do anymore I love going to the house of the Lord and some people say is that where you get an enjoyment from my ass and that's where I get my enjoyment from you may go and get intoxicated but I come here for the joy of the Lord would be my portion Amen to give us strength to walk the next day and give us strength to walk the next week and and galp Us in life's journey as we're moving along with the Lord I'm glad I don't have to look a long way off but I I can trust in the Lord that knows every day that's in front of me and he he knows every day that's in front of you because he has a care for you therefore he gives you a liberty he gives you freedom and the message on the Easter seal in 65 brother Brown says we were for ordained of God for this hour I thank God for that I say if there's ever an age that we could live and I I'm glad I don't live in the horse and buggy age I even though I like to look at a horse and the pastor but to go and saddle them up every day for transportation I'm glad I don't I'm living in this hour that we're living in I'm glad we have a light switch on the wall I'm glad we don't have to trim the trim the Wicks anymore and do all those things that's nice once in a while to create an atmosphere but I'm real happy when the atmosphere is over I say sister Meyer let's just flick the switch amen because I like I like the hour that we live in because this is the hour that has been promised that we shall not die but we shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye it's in this hour which is the greatest hour of all the ages to live is in this day that we're living today amen I'm glad I don't have to feed oats to something I'm glad to put gasoline into something you know what I'm saying amen I'm glad that we have jet planes to fly I'm glad we can do all those things amen we can move around quickly and God's ordained it at the end time that we could be here or your pastor could be come up to our place to minister amen and encourage the people in the Lord and one day those jet planes won't mean anything to us anymore because we're going to travel like a thought I say that we are privileged in this hour to live right in this day that we live in today Amen brother Brown said we are fordained of God for this hour the word of God manifests itself right through us and we live in the presence of God by the word promise of God there ain't a devil in hell can keep me from Raising and a door he could shut in my face at that morning the seals have been broken and brother Brown says hallelujah I'm free I'm an eagle can we say that this morning I'm free I'm an eagle let's say it was some passion this morning I'm praying I'm an eagle amen if we're an eagle then I'll be brother Brown says I'm no longer in a cage I'm happy to be out of that cage amen I'm happy I'm not the devil the devil's slave anymore I'm happy that I'm a slave unto Jesus Christ my Lord I'm happy that something has happened within our heart he says but I'm free I've raised from the dead into the new life of Jesus Christ not only me but every man woman boy or girl sitting here that's been filled with the into the spirit of God is a new creature in Christ and you are are an eagle I say that's exactly who we are now Eagle is a free burn he's not locked up on the ground I I appreciate the little birds that are that are in our trees and things and now they're starting to come back to where we are in Canada you guys are about four or five weeks ahead of us with your weather pattern we still got snow back home sister mom was telling me I hope it's melted by the time we get there but I said I don't know it's not going to be melted the weather's still real cool right now amen but but an eagle is a bird that can fly free remember the story brother Brown told about that eagle that was in that cage in that zoo and and how that that Eagle's head was all bloodied over and he just couldn't get out of that cage and brother Brown have said if he could have bought that eagle he would have bought it just to set it free and he kind of thought about men and women who are trapped in the devil's cage and how that they're beating their head to get out of that cage because they're not in Liberty if you serve the Devil he's not going to give you any Liberty he's not going to give you any freedom some people say when they leave the message I I got freedom back on my heart I said you got no freedom in your heart you become a prisoner to your condition you can become a prisoner in what you're doing there's no Freedom serving the devil there's only freedom in serving the lord Jesus Christ amen is there a witness in this house this morning there's only Freedom when you serve almighty God when he changed me would be when he changed us we became new creatures in Christ Jesus Liberty speaks of freedom excuse me were free from the burden of sin and shame does that make you still happy I find sometimes we we hear so much word sometimes a little Elementary Parts maybe don't really throw our heart anymore but it still throws my heart I'm free from the burden of sin and shame amen I'm freedom I have freedom from man-made religion I was one time a prisoner in man-made religion I'm so happy to be out of that somebody tried to put me in a pigeonhole no longer I said I ain't going into the pigeonhole I'm free and I've been born free and I'm not going back underneath no man-made religion this message is all I need it's all I want it's everything that's provided for me for life's journey and to move me right into the change of the body what more do we need we just need more faith in what we're reading amen we need to have a soul in our heart that one day when that anointing comes we will be changed amen I believe it's close at hand church amen we're free we've received the free gift of salvation what a glorious thing that is just bear with me for a while we receive the free gift of Salvation the the Bible tells us for by grace are you saved and and through faith and that's not of yourself it is a gift of God I'm happy to have this free gift of Salvation Amen in our town There's hundreds of people and thousands of people that don't experience this free gift but it came by our way and we received the free gift that God gave us and they're never the same anymore we're changing people look at it that we're restricted I say I'm not restricted I'm an eagle in this hour I fly in this hour I'm moving to the heavenlies amen When Faith Bank moves up I just move up with that Faith Bay amen because we're free we're Eagles in this hour we're no longer just underneath the man age or the ox age or the lion age but we're into the eagle age in this hour and if our egos the less fly like eagles less soar like eagles let our faith hold us up as an eagle let it come underneath our wings and move us at one time we were Bound in sin we were Bound by complexes we're bombed by I'm belief we're bombed by the power of the enemy but we heard the gospel trumpet and we were declared that we were free amen we know the story in the Old Testament when the 50th year would come around which was in the Year of Jubilee and the year Jubilee came around and that Trump had sounded they dropped their hole right where they were at and they were a free man they were they were in in prison they were slaves to their condition but when that trumpet sounded they became free man at that time amen I believe we're free men and women today amen I say that we're free to Worship in Liberty amen we're free to praise our God Amen if the spirit moves upon us then we allow God to take over and we're free to have the gifts of the church move within the church amen we're thankful for what God has done for us Amen in second Corinthians 3 17 it says now the Lord is a spirit and we're the spirit of the Lord is there is libertine in the in the Greek the word Liberty means to do or to Omit things having no relationship to Salvation Liberty to do or to Omit things having no relationship to Salvation the Liberty to do as one pleases true Liberty is living as we ought to not as we please amen that's where true Liberty is I'm thankful for the boundary of the word of God that keeps us in this hour amen I I'm like that guy that would be who if he was driving that stage coach one guy would say well I can ride right on the rim of the of the of the canyon and he was a real good horse rider or driving his care Chariot and the other person said I can ride it right over here the wheel's just kind of right on the edge and the other guy said I I'm not that good of a driver but I like to stay right close to the mountain amen that's a guy that I'm going to choose and I'm not going to try these other ones I want to be as close to the mountain I want to be a close to the word of God as I know how amen I want my life always to be matching what the Bible says about me amen I want to be a an image of what God had foresaw me to be and foresaw each one of us to be when we come to the other side amen we'll be exactly in the spot he would have us to be amen just once more Lord Brother Brown says you were saved 1900 years ago and now maybe today you'll accept that salvation but it's already paid for let's say paid for tonight or this morning it's paid for the debt has been cleared up the devil that put you in a pawn shop Jesus came and redeemed you and opened up the doors and the only thing you have to do is walk out let's say walk out this morning walk out and claim your Liberty that's all you have a receipt from God that is debt paid Glory Jesus said in his last words it is finished every Redemptive blessing was completely finished God's Great wrath on sin when when he became sin for us it was the debt was settled Satan has no more power amen do you believe that this morning amen I hope you had a good rest last night amen do you believe that this morning amen the dead has settled the dead is paid Satan has no more power amen only as he could Bluff with it if he could Bluff he went to all right you'll have to have it but legally he has no power at all I remember one time there was a guy that wanted to be a police officer but he wasn't no police officer he dressed himself up like a police officer bought him one of those little uh things that he put on the side there there was flick around bread and so forth he decided he was going to basically he did it too he turned he stopped people on the highway but also they realized he was no police officer and so he had no Authority in order to give him a ticket and so here we are brother Brown was saying that the devil legally has no power at all he could try to stop you but he can't stop you he may try to hinder you but he can't hinder you he may try to do a lot of things in your life but he can't do anything in his life because legally he has no power he has no Authority our Lord broke it on Calvary amen when he when he when he went to Calvary he has no power at all every Power he had was taken from him at Calvary that's where the price was paid he has nothing but a bluff if you want to listen to us Bluff well all right but you don't have to you are free tonight this morning he he has made you free and now is something in God's word can make you realize that you are free by his grace or something realized and the word makes you understand or some Act of God that it included you it accepts it includes us all then you just accept it on those bases and you're free also you don't have to feel different you don't have to feel anything at all Jesus never said did you feel it he said did you believe it amen who has heard our report did you believe it amen you believed it it's Faith that's our faith is an arm a mighty arm that holds a sharp two-edged sword of God and that sharp two-edged disorder will cut every let's say every every Promise free if the arm of faith is able to yield that sword some people have got some weak muscle trouble they maybe take a little scratch enough to join a church others can come into justification some can come all the way to the baptism of the Holy Ghost but a great strong arm holding this Bible can cut every Promise free that's right so be strong in the Lord I say this morning hour I believe that we believe that with all of our heart a strong arm of faith can cut every promise from the word of God uh we're alive in Jesus Christ send debt on Calvary has been paid Jesus sent back the Holy Ghost which is the comforter on the day of Pentecost which is the earnest of our inheritance we possess that now amen everything the church the Living God has need of we've received from God has been has been paid for there's nothing that's not paid for I kind of like that when I go to a bank I used to bring a bill into the bank and they had those big stamps and they would click click and when that click went down that meant it was paid for that mean that Bill had no more power or authority over me amen it was fully paid in full and Jesus Christ has paid everything we have need of if we need salvation it's paid for if we need healing it's paid for our transgressions are paid for our iniquities have been paid for healing has been paid for somebody help me this morning freedom is ours has been paid for victory is ours has been paid for Joy is art has been paid for amen peace is ours it's been paid for everything we need a life's journey has been paid for we are in a possession of it right now amen that's paid for marked and marked in full payment there's nothing that we that that God has promised us it's all paid for now [Applause] I don't know about you but that's Happy that makes me happy we sing a song a wonderful song Jesus Paid It All amen that song says it all all to him I owe so if he's paid for everything then we want to give our life to him freely he's left Sinners left a crimson stream but he's washed at white as snow amen that's one of the old song but I love that old song because Jesus has paid it all everything's been paid for all we can do is we can point people to that and that's all I can do or anybody else can do is to point people of Jesus Christ who has already healed them who has already given us everything we have need of it's already in the atonement and we accept it freely based upon faith in the word of God amen praise the Lord when he died at Calvary he paid the Supreme price amen all the Redemptive blessings that he died for a Calvary is already paid for before God the dead is fully paid let's say fully paid this morning and you're excused before God you're taken out of the pawn shop that's right the only thing you have to do is accept faith in Christ and walk out of the pawn shop that's all amen we just gotta walk out of whatever if the enemy's trying to do something we resist him amen the word resists we turn them down where we just turn them down flat if he comes in we turn him down if he tries to hinder our family we turn him down if he's got one of our children in a script we turn him down and we send Faith out to our children Amen to let the prodigals come back into the house of God Amen because you've been given Authority in this hour I say Church of the Living God but the word of God in your mouth and proclaim the promises of God that's been given to you in this hour receive it believe it then act upon it it's not a time to say oh what was he was in me brother Joe always said that all the time come preach for us he'd always say oh Rosie woes of me it's no wussy nothing it's time to pick up ourselves and be Sons and Daughters of the Living God and put the promise in our mouth proclaim the promise of God believe it with all that's within our heart what's the point of believing to having something if you can't believe it then we fall into the category who has believed our report I want to say this morning we have believed the report we believe it with all of our heart it becomes everything to the believer we believe the report the report is you're free he's giving you Freedom he's given you Liberty in this hour except your Liberty walk in your Liberty Isaiah 53 5 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastise them in our peace is upon him and with his stripes we were we are healed to finish work we're healed you sometimes we want it to happen overnight but that's not what the promise is the promises were healed it may take a long time it took took Abraham 25 years for the promise to come I look out as I look out at 25 years a long time but there came a time when the promise was fulfilled there came a time when Abraham woke up in the morning and he looked over and and the wife that he had married she was back to a young woman again there came a time when that happened and she looked over at Abraham and said something happened here you're a young you're a young man again you're young and handsome again you know my our old Pastor brother brother Gunther he's gone on to be with the Lord and he always told me there's two stages in life he said one of the stages in life is that you're good looking in the other stages you're looking good I kind of fall in this other looking good part is where I'm now people come up to me and said oh you're still looking good I say well that's kind of a compliment but I remember that all the time every time they say it I'm not good looking anymore I'm I'm just looking good now but there's coming a time when sister Mars going to say wow you're handsome again here you're the one I'd marry that time amen because we got a promise too the token message no devil no sickness no death no sorrow no anything else can bother you as long as you hold that token over it your unchanging Faith pulsates out and it forms a form of Christ Jesus the image that you're walking in today amen and when I see the token I'll pass over you it's a sign it's a sign that the price has been paid Jesus Paid the price and and you receive it from him holding the token in your hand and you have an assurance of Resurrection you have the assurance that everything you have need of in this journey is provided in that token of his suffering at Calvary where he met the price of Every curse that could be put on you the token speaks peace amen further down he says and now you are his oh because he He Is We have the right to all that he has purchased for us every promise in the Bible is yours let's say it's mine this morning I think years ago I I spoke that here possibly maybe 12 13 years ago there's seven thousand some promises in the Bible and on there's and and there's a couple the devil made but he never kept one of them and he's not going to keep one of them either he made lots of promises but he what can he keep he can't keep a promise he's a liar but God but God is not the author of a liar he's a law for author of life and peace amen he's given us everything for life's journey I say take it receive it amen every promise in the Bible is yours it belongs to you when this token is upon you and God has sealed you now we want to check ourselves just for a moment when God has given you the true baptism the Holy Ghost then the life of Jesus Christ is within you now that's true and every theological have to admit that it is that that that uh it's it's true it is it is yes sir it's a new birth you are born Anew of the Holy Spirit and because that God has did this and you know that you're no good in yourself and you accept what God has did then he seals you into the kingdom by the Holy Spirit and everything let's say everything everything that Jesus purchased and promised you in the Bible it's yours it's your property because it's paid for he says amen amen he goes on he says Life Is Mine he paid for it life is yours he paid for it healing his mind he paid for it healing is yours he paid for it amen freedom is mine he paid for it Heaven is mine he paid for it he has paid the price everything he purchased belongs to the man that holds the Tolkien amen I say we've got the token in our hand this more this morning hour marked paid in full amen so we have nothing to worry about there's nothing to worry about he's already made it for you when he looks through his blood he can only see you as perfect as he always saw you amen we look at one another and see imperfections but he can't see us that way because he saw us the way we were before the foundation of the world therefore he sees you just as perfect as he always saw you if you're a son and daughter of God then everything you have need of is paid for he's given you a great promise in this hour there's nothing we have to worry about if we go by the way of the Grave we know what he calls we're going to come out of the Grave amen and we're looking forward to that time amen I could hardly wait to see some of my loved ones coming back other than grape I'm looking for it all the time one day expect a knock on the door my loved one will show up on the door amen we know that change will be in rear at that time amen we have an expectation for it we already have the Tolkien everything we have need of is given in that token it's in your hand it's Mark paid in the message influenced he said oh if we could only realize that that the Holy Ghost is upon us creating in US of Faith trying to present himself in so many different ways and gifts to create a faith for a rapturing church it should put us into action he said but wonder if we're just doing it the way he wanted it to be done to be with reverence and humility the pillar of fire in this last days ought to put the whole church into action it being Vindicated signs of his coming is at hand amen we believe that we say that was preached a long time ago but it's nearer today than it's ever been amen I remember as a child growing up I heard those things all the time but today it's nearer than what it was back then it's near at Hound right now if you're not in Christ I recommend this would be the day to get in Christ there's no time to push it off no time to delay amen it should be an urgency within our heart amen the Lord is coming amen we must be ready for the time of his appearing amen Ephesians chapter 1 1-13 verse 13 to 14 in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom also after you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise you were sealed which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory amen we're sealed to the day of our Redemption amen so we we don't have to work ourselves into the kingdom of God you're already in the kingdom of God when you're sealed amen sometimes people say I gotta gotta do this all you need to do is heal yourself to God let the Holy Spirit wash you from everything that's not of him amen receive everything that he has for you walk in it to the best of your ability everything's paid you've got the token in your hand you know that you that that one day you're going to be changing your mortal body amen somebody say praise the Lord this morning Amen in the true Easter sealant and I want to just want to read Ephesians 1 13-14 are the passion just in a moment here he says and now the seal is a sign of a finished work and we know that a seal that you're going to seal a boxcar well they put all the the work in it to store everything up and then it's sealed till its destination let's say his destination amen we're sealed to that day and he says any seal is a finished work when you write a document then it's sealed at the end never sealed until it's finished now the blood of bulls and Heifers and so forth would not take sin away but with this but when this was finished at Calvary it took away sin amen the sin question is over what does sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word of God Amen you take unbelief away that faith will come up in your heart amen then you'll not doubt the word of God you'll believe the word of God and faith will bring it into action and it will be manifested in your life amen because of faith and what you have heard in the word of God somebody say praise the Lord the passion translation Ephesians 1 13 I love this church and you bear with me I just some of these things I just I just it means so much love and with all my heart and because of him when you who are not Jews heard the revelation of Truth you believed in the wonderful news of Salvation now we have been stamped with the Seal of the promised Holy Spirit I like that we've been stamped let's say stamp stamp with the Seal of the promised Holy Spirit in the ancient times the Kings and you would use what was called a Signet ring and that saying that ring was designed to bring was a was designated Authority and honor or ownership amen if the king had that on his hand it was a Signet ring when he stamped a document that document had all the power of the Kingdom behind it amen when you were stabbed by the holy spirit in your life all the power of the kingdom of God is behind you amen we are an ambassador in this hour but we're sealed with the promise of the Holy Ghost amen and all of Heaven is behind the Church of the Living God that segment would contain an emblem unique to the king it was not everybody had the same thing that you had one and you and the were yours was the same it was a saying that was was unique to that King our King has a unique Signet as well amen when it puts his when he puts it across your heart you'll never the chain same person anymore amen official documents were sealed with a a daploop of soft wax and he would impress it with the King saying that usually keeping on a ring on his finger such a seal certified the document as genuine much like an ordinary public stamp today and so that was important because it was a stamped Paul is using those analogies to to show to us that God has also stamped upon you the sign of ownership amen that he owns you you are part of him we become a love slave unto the Lord Jesus Christ amen and we and we therefore the fruits of almighty God I look at some people say they got the Holy Ghost said and there's mad as a hornet and and they shoot they just get everything upsets them all the time I say we just need more of the holy ghost in her life it came and to bring that that anger out of our life amen and replace it with the sweetness of almighty God Hallelujah that's the truth anyhow brother brownwell talks about that people who get so mad like shooting Buckshot on a on a piece of cowhide shouldn't be in the house of God I don't know why I'm saying that but I just said it verse 14 in in the in the passion translation he has given to us like an engagement ring is given to a bride as the first installment of what's coming amen he is our whole promise of a future inheritance which seals us onto until we have all the Redemptive blessings and experiences complete Freedom all for the Supreme Glory and honor of God when I met well sister admire myself we grew up in church and so she sat on one aisle and I sat in the center I sat on the other aisle the deacons were always watching making sure we were making eyes at one another that Hall of soap too if we did too say okay there's no making eyes in church no passing notes nowadays they just send text messages kind of sneak around it that way I remember the moment when I moment I'm talking about an engagement ring he's given us engagement ring like you give to a bride the first installment I remember when I when I asked sister Mar if she would marry me we were just kids but but it was we still have that plaque up I'd marry you again I'd never change the thing about him I never would I was only 18 she was 16. we were just kids growing up together no don't tell your parents that brother Kelly Sister Mary got married when they were kids but we were kids and and I remember when I asked her if she would marry me I gave her an engagement ring as a token of my love to her and my she received that and my heart was fluttering her heart was fluttering but you know the thing that I noticed that I observed I really observed this is that she she never tried to hide it see people try to hide their Christianity on Monday if it's really in your heart you can't hide it because there's something in your heart that wants to display it no she had that ring out where everybody could see it you ever see it done they kind of have it up this big rock right over here there's one hey did you guys get engaged oh yeah do you want to see it and they're so but you see people people want to hide Christ in their life if it's really in your life if you've been given an engagement like onto engagement ring to the day which is the first installment how could you hide Christ in your life no a sister oh you want to see it oh is that or nice and every night she'd take it off she'd polish that thing up still does it after 40 42 years I guess we're married now she's still polishes that thing up all the time makes sense it does not look nice still part of sparkles just like the day he gave it to me must have meant a lot to her on that day I gave it to her amen but you know she doesn't try to hide it amen why do we want to try to hide Christ in our life if it's really if it's really in your life and you've got that engagement of predestinated unmerited favor on your finger why would we want to hide that we don't want to hide it we don't want to just display it while we're in church with with all people that believe the same faith we want to display it on Monday and on Tuesday on Wednesday Thursday every day of the week we want to keep it on display all the time why because it becomes our life Yuri she's engaged to me who are you engaging brother Kelly Hildebrand I can just remember it all happening back then and she was proud of it but if you're engaged in the King of Kings think of a church not just any person but to the king of kings and he's personally selected you to be part of him you don't want to hide what God has done for you you want to shine it forth you want the world to know where Christ is done great things has he done in your life you want people to see it there's no point hiding what God has done put it on display Let It Shine forth out of your life the glory of the Lord why am I different well because I'm engaged to a wedding amen I'm part of the Bride of Jesus Christ he's part of me and I'm part of him amen we gotta we got a date coming before us there's a wedding coming before us amen we're gonna be at the marriage supper of the lab what a great time we're gonna be yeah excuse me you don't want to hide it you want to put it on display hey man let the world know testify of the goodness of Jesus Christ with that first installment of what's what's coming I love that well we know what's coming we know there's a marriage supper there's a millennial brain amen no pain and suffering over there not going to worry about all the politics that's all gone hey man New Jerusalem is coming eternity is coming hey man the Bible says the half of it has not been told and we've already got the first installment on our hand hey man what a grub what a privileged people we are in this hour amen for what God has done for us in this day I say blessed be the name of the Lord we're going to a wedding in the sky we're getting ready for it he slipped the wedding band on you before the foundation of the world brother Brown said what a Thanksgiving hallelujah praise our God amen It's a grand time it's a time that a time where the glory of the Lord should be our portion hey man where we should be we shouldn't be uh said last night be down on the dumps all the time it's time that we should have the joy of the Lord shining through our life amen I I mentioned this back home hope this is okay brother Ron Brother Andrew I mentioned this back home I said some of us the way we look on Monday morning who would ever want to be like us he said they wouldn't want to say they go to that church they're miserable disguise you could ever find I say what in the world are we trying to do we should have we should if anybody should have joy we should have joy their temporal joy that they have is no joy but the joy of the Lord is your passion amen we should have it in our hearts Let It Shine out of your life not sit on the other side of the church because the other person you don't like on the other side of the church that's for free I always always tell the people maybe we should have taken the offering after I was done preaching maybe be smaller I don't know we should have the joy of the Lord part of us maybe a little pastoral this morning but it's on my heart we should have it in our lives should be on display all the time amen our children are watching us and how we act they just pick it up next thing you know they're they're doing things that we thought why are they doing that well They're copying an image our image is off the heavenly should be shining in our life they're watching our image it'll change your home it'll make you make your home a place of Refuge a place of peace amen a place that you want to be at everything we have need of is being given to us in life we have nothing nothing let's say nothing this morning there's nothing lacking at all everything we have need of we have it God has provided it every Church age looked to this age for the Revelation that we would have and none of those ages could receive it but this age it was to be fulfilled and it has been fulfilled the seals are open we can see God in plain view we can see the bride ourselves in plain view amen and if we see him in plain view then we're a mere image off of him because we're line upon line and precept upon precept and hear a little on their level we we are him instead because he's he's shining on our lives but we're the reflection of him and his absence so whatever God anybody's going to see is going to come through our lives amen God has provided it we're free we we're not in jail anymore we're not in the Caged up anymore we are free it's no wonder brother Brown said Gates of Hell give way Gates of Hell give way was he doing the people were trying to get out of there but they couldn't get out of that condition amen but when he said the big bars he said he started gates of hell they started creaking and banging and popping and until their bars opened up and the people said we're free amen where were they free favor free from denominationalism they were free from what bound them into a system and now they're at Liberty to worship the Living God and to lift their voices to the Living God Amen I say what Freedom we have Amen in the house of God what Freedom we have in our own homes amen I I feel like I'm Free Like a Bird amen why because what Jesus has done for me it's not what I have in myself but what's a Christ has given to us church amen there was a I was thinking about this in the covet time and and I have I was in under quarantine for for for not very long fortunately but it was just for a few days and and I remember when they called me and they said they said uh talk to me one more time and they wanted to know okay when did this happen or did that happen you all had it here the same way with the same protocol and and so I was only in quarantine on Friday and this was Sunday and someday um they called and all of a sudden Sunday she said you're free and she went through the whole thing and the date and all this and she said you're free well I've only been in quarantined for two days and I was real happy to be free I'll tell you what when I looked at my yard and I looked at I can't go past that boundary I felt like a prisoner I didn't know what to do with myself I thought I told sister Mara I said this isn't good they're going to watch us and they called us and make sure we're behaving ourselves at home I never seen anything like that and so I was free and she wasn't she wasn't very happy because she didn't get free with the same day I got free it was two weeks later when she got free and and she really let those Health people know it too but anyhow but I got free and I was happy to be free amen the first thing I asked that nurse when she called me I asked her and excuse me for my carnality for a moment ask can I go wash my truck she said you can go do whatever you want to do you're free I felt so good to be free not realizing at that time that brother Abe we was in the ICU unit and they wanted somebody to come pray for him and the day they called me is the day they Set Me Free and the very next day I went to pray for him and I see you you I said our God does great thing I said brother Abe god Set Me Free and God's gonna set you free from this bed of Affliction that you're in right now I said get ready for it amen God's gonna bring you out of this place amen because he promised his word amen we're Freeborn citizens Hallelujah God does things well he does things on time every time amen one look like a disaster turned out for the glory of almighty God Hallelujah brother Abe came out of that hospital room just a couple of days later and and he's doing well he just come home from Louisiana a couple days we're turning around and coming right back to you all but he's so he was so happy I was so happy I thought Lord what does it feel like to have Liberty to have freedom hey man I couldn't imagine being bound up in a jail cell amen I'm thankful for Freedom that we've gone the truth shall make you free you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free which was the words of Jesus and if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed and that word in the Greek means set a Liberty from the Dominion of sin of Liberty from the Dominion of sin so we're no longer captive to the Dominion of sin we've just changed kingdoms I don't know if it's in your news but we have it in our news back home about about the Royal Family and and about about one of the sons that he feels left out and so forth and no doubt it's it's in your country I think he's got a book written or whatever more but I was thinking about that for a while and I thought if they are our King's son or a queen son then there are certain ways they're taught in order to be a king son and to be a queen son there are certain protocols they have to go through they have to know how to conduct themselves in public they've got to know how to eat when they get it to the table they've got to know how to stand and they have to know how to wave just right if to me and you it looks ridiculous but church we are also King sons amen and King King sons amen we're being trained a certain way ain't it because we're set free from the Dominion of sin and we're in the Kingdom of almighty God and God is training us to rule and reign with him that's why all we take with us is our character and that character is going to be tried in the fiery flame of Affliction to see what's inside of our own heart amen I say Lord if you want to turn up the heat then turn it up because I don't want anything in my life that will hinder me from that day [Applause] we're King sons and daughters of the Living God Amen we're being groomed to be a king to be able to sit on the throne with Christ not just any person but chosen people chosen people that were in the thoughts of God from before the foundation of the world Amen I say blessed be the name of the Lord amen I'm just going to skip a little bit here every slave when they heard the trumpet sound they threw down their coves hoes amen they were free the debt was paid they didn't know anything anymore everything was over hey man I look at Romans 8 30 to 31. it says moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he also called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified amen what shall we say to these things of God before us who can be against us amen I say this morning hour of gods for you who can be against you amen when Jesus Christ destroyed the working of the devil on Calvary amen and we're free men and women today amen we're Justified amen we're glorified and if he's been for Glorified amen what can we say to these things I like what Paul says amen he says if God before us and who can be against us amen no matter what we go through if God is for us who could be against us as it is written excuse me for thy sake we are killed all the day long we're counted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded amen let's say I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels or principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death death nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen there's nothing that can separate us amen we're sealed in by the Seal of Promise of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives amen we're bearing forth the fruits of righteousness that we should bear forth in this hour amen I say all the fruits of righteousness maybe do a little bit here and there but I say church we need to Bear forth everything amen God has set us free then we're declared free this morning we've heard the gospel trumping and the trumpet has been an affirmative trumpet is declared that you're free amen all the sin question is over let's say it's over I don't know who I'm preaching to this morning but the Lord laid it on my heart amen and if it's over it's over you don't have to worry about it anymore I've had so many people over the last while come and talk to me and I mentioned it last night I don't know if I'm good enough I I don't know if if I'm saved I don't know so many questions about it we've got to get in our heart that God has paid the price and it's over we just have to accept it as a free gift of God Amen and put on righteousness in our lives and in our heart amen that God would be well pleased and on that day say Well done thy good and faithful servant enter thou unto the the joys of the Lord amen we're Freeborn and for free board we can do whatever you want to do amen God's word Freeborn citizens of the Heavenly Kingdom I got no desire to go get drunk just in the house of God no desire for the things excuse me the old enemy's trying to hinder me today but it's okay I can talk and he's still defeated God's made us free if you're afraid let's be free the com the trumpet has sounded freedom is ringing out the freedom is ringing on then we're free we're at Liberty you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place I shared that with a brother he just said he said I just can hardly accept that I said well I said I accept it with all my heart you never sinned in the first place he said you know all my mistakes I said no I don't care to know either I said because I have my own list of mistakes but this says you never sinned at the first place so I put that in my own heart amen God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washed in your old book of divorcement is put away as dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God Hallelujah You're The Virtuous bride of Christ can we say that's me let's be passionate about it that's me that's who we are we're the sinless bride of Jesus Christ he said you're The Virtuous bride of Christ washing the blood of Christ precious virtuous sin the Son of God standing with the pure unadulterated word bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you from which we're predestinating the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was the great attribute of God Called Love then if we're free then we're free and whom the son is set free is free indeed amen God bless you just a small thought that I wanted to share this morning with you I trust it was a blessing to you amen if the musicians can come forward at this time blessed be the name of the Lord I'm free I'm free to worship there's a little song that I sang here last time when I was here you don't know like I know and I know you all know that song I really really love that song if we could just sing that together brother Andrew if you want to lead us in that song amen I love that song you
