[23:54] Lord how many enjoyed that service last
[23:56] night I had just brother Matthew if
[23:59] you've never got to meet him or be
[24:00] around him I suggest you do that cuz
[24:02] he's you know when when we hear brother
[24:04] brandom talk about a humble servant
[24:06] that's brother Matthew and I've been
[24:07] around him for the last handful of years
[24:09] and several occasions and I'm telling
[24:11] you he's he's a he's a servant that just
[24:14] wants to do nothing but especially serve
[24:16] the youth and uh just be here for the
[24:18] people and be a servant and you're going
[24:19] to if you didn't watch last night I
[24:21] suggest you go back you got into a
[24:22] Channel of forgiveness and just started
[24:24] nailing some things that are right down
[24:26] a path that each and every one of us can
[24:28] go back and listen to time and time
[24:30] again let's just take these knes to the
[24:33] Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're
[24:35] just so grateful to be able to come and
[24:37] gather here once again this morning and
[24:40] there's not one service that we want to
[24:41] take for granted that we could come and
[24:43] be here and Lord we could just we can
[24:45] just take a look back at the storms
[24:47] that's that swept through areas that's
[24:49] never had storms like that and we we see
[24:51] the ones in Tennessee and the all the
[24:53] help and the love that's going to those
[24:55] and I just want us to take and be able
[24:57] to look at that and say you know that's
[24:58] a Thousand-Year flood as they would call
[25:00] it and how quickly things could be how
[25:03] quickly things could be lost these what
[25:05] we have here on Earth is is perishable
[25:07] but the greatest thing of all could be
[25:09] your love Lord and our brotherly love
[25:12] for one another and just a love and a
[25:14] kinded spirit of you Lord and Lord we
[25:16] hear each and every one of these prayer
[25:17] requests that would go forth as we see
[25:20] brother Clarence there and he's got
[25:21] fluid there on his lungs I just believe
[25:23] that you could just go and you could you
[25:25] could just remove that you've designed
[25:26] our bodies to be able to just absorb
[25:28] those things and put them right back
[25:30] into place to where it's like they were
[25:31] never there and you can just remove you
[25:33] can remove tumors you can remove cancers
[25:35] you can remove each and everything
[25:37] that's in our life and Lord Jesus I
[25:39] believe that even even greater than that
[25:41] the the greatest sin of all is just just
[25:44] have an unbelief Lord and I just believe
[25:46] that that you could just come and you
[25:47] could take away all all unbelief for any
[25:50] any situation that we may be facing and
[25:52] lost loved ones that may be out in the
[25:54] world that it seems like there is no
[25:56] hope it seems like there's no hope to
[25:58] bring them back in but we're seeing it
[26:00] each and every day we're seeing it as as
[26:02] you're calling loved ones home and
[26:04] you're calling each and every one of us
[26:05] right right back to our rightful place
[26:07] with you and Lord Jesus we know that
[26:09] predestination is is everything and
[26:12] there's a there's been a seed and if you
[26:13] put a seat in our seed in our life
[26:15] before the foundation of the world
[26:17] there's not one thing that Satan can do
[26:19] to remove us and Lord Jesus I pray that
[26:21] you would be with brother Matthew here
[26:22] this morning as he would bring forth the
[26:24] word just anoint him once more allow him
[26:26] to fall into the chainel that you would
[26:29] you would need each and every one of us
[26:30] to hear and speak directly to our needs
[26:32] and we're just so thankful for what
[26:34] you're about to do and what you did down
[26:36] there in Louisiana for those and brother
[26:37] Ron we just ask you continue to
[26:39] strengthen him and we just thank you for
[26:41] all that you are doing in Jesus name we

[48:18] Philippians 3 if you have that say amen
[48:21] amen Brethren I count it not myself to

[48:29] Paul and he's telling us you got to do
[48:32] this oh yeah amen if he's telling you
[48:35] this is what I have to do do you think
[48:37] Paul did some things that were bad oh
[48:39] yeah to him for for the Apostle Paul to
[48:42] say I'm the chiefest of Sinners yeah I
[48:46] know some of us would like to argue that
[48:47] with him amen but but he's telling you
[48:49] something that is an absolute key for
[48:52] you to go up higher he's telling you
[48:54] something that is an absolute key so I

[49:23] forgetting those things which are behind

[49:28] that are before I press to the mark of
[49:31] the prize of the High Calling what kind
[49:33] of calling is it it's not a low calling
[49:35] it's not a halfway calling he's calling
[49:38] you higher oh yeah of God in Christ

[50:10] know where you're at this morning but I
[50:12] believe God is calling and I'm going to
[50:13] stay on the same topic but it's just
[50:15] within my heart that not only for the
[50:18] minister to come up higher not only for
[50:21] the Deacon to come up higher the trustee
[50:23] the Ley every youth come up higher in
[50:26] your walk it's time for this bride to go

[50:34] here to tell you Satan you're a liar you
[50:36] always were a liar and you've already
[50:38] lost the battle so we're going to preach
[50:39] this morning and tear your kingdom down

[50:43] body back from moving to the place that
[50:46] God wants her to be the place of a
[50:48] perfect Unity moving in one voice one
[50:51] mind in one Accord a statue of a perfect
[50:55] man on display that the the the the
[50:58] Earth would see this is my bride she is

[1:01:42] nest you know this mama Eagle would come
[1:01:44] down and she' begin to they make this
[1:01:46] nest in such a way that they put fur
[1:01:48] around it put feathers and you know they
[1:01:50] kill the rabbit and they make sure they
[1:01:51] skin it bring it up there and lay it so
[1:01:53] so everything's nice and comfortable but
[1:01:56] there comes a time when Mama begins to
[1:01:57] bring food back as She lays the food
[1:01:59] down she reaches over and grabs that fur
[1:02:01] and
[1:02:02] goes grabs a claw and just throws it out
[1:02:04] of the nest or as they're eating as
[1:02:07] they're
[1:02:08] eating sometimes as you're eating and
[1:02:10] the preacher talks about
[1:02:13] Pride it sticks a little bit oh yeah and
[1:02:16] it begins to get a little
[1:02:18] uncomfortable and the eagle begins to
[1:02:20] realize what's the eagle doing Papa
[1:02:22] Eagle knows you got some potential Papa
[1:02:25] eagle knows you're not meant just to
[1:02:27] stay in an S and live with Easy Living
[1:02:29] Papa Eagle knows it's time for the Bride
[1:02:32] of Jesus Christ to go flying it's time
[1:02:34] for you to go soaring it's time for you
[1:02:36] to recognize all that you can do come on
[1:02:39] come on somebody this eag will stand
[1:02:41] over the top of them oh yeah and it'll
[1:02:44] spread his wings wide what is it it's
[1:02:46] the opening of the word that's what
[1:02:48] these preachers are preaching they're
[1:02:49] preaching the opening of the word that
[1:02:51] it can identify who you are it's from
[1:02:54] Genesis to revelation
[1:02:56] and it's letting know the Little Eagles
[1:02:58] this is your place this is you who you
[1:03:01] are you're not you're not one that goes
[1:03:03] back you're not one that backs away but
[1:03:06] you're one that takes the very message
[1:03:08] and goes higher with
[1:03:10] it brother Brandon fulfilled his job oh
[1:03:14] yeah come on he preached it with
[1:03:16] everything he had and he gave it to us
[1:03:18] but it's time for us to take that
[1:03:20] message and eat that message and begin
[1:03:23] to let our lives prophesy again what are
[1:03:26] we got to prophesy we are them it's
[1:03:32] me think of the little boy as he looked
[1:03:35] in the mirror he didn't recognize who he
[1:03:37] was and I believe a lot of you looked in
[1:03:39] this message and you thought man that's
[1:03:41] really good but could that really be
[1:03:45] me but as you look
[1:03:53] again my life screams Amen to what it
[1:03:58] says my life says I identify Lord I want
[1:04:01] every bit of it the same as Mary said
[1:04:04] Lord I don't understand how it's going
[1:04:05] to happen I don't understand it all but
[1:04:08] God I hear your word this morning
[1:04:10] there's an angel visitation that came
[1:04:11] down and all Mary said was be it unto me

[1:04:19] to come up higher but God is here this
[1:04:21] morning and he's letting you know if you
[1:04:23] will yield your life if you will lay

[1:33:01] rock pushing with all his might each
[1:33:04] night the man returned to his cabin sore
[1:33:06] worn out feeling his whole day had been
[1:33:08] spent in vain seeing that man showed
[1:33:10] signs of discouragement Satan decided to
[1:33:12] enter the

[1:33:37] hearing the word of God and the word of
[1:33:40] God is calling me higher I didn't call
[1:33:42] myself but if he's calling me higher
[1:33:44] he's made a way for me to go higher and
[1:33:46] if it's a supernatural experience or
[1:33:48] it's a dayby day walk and I begin to
[1:33:50] walk up the ladder straight to heaven

[1:33:55] that
[1:33:57] guy identify as him though a lot of our
[1:34:01] problems we listen to that and we think

[1:34:04] that's Satan entered into your mind and
[1:34:07] he's so
[1:34:09] slide but once you identify him kick him

[1:43:30] into the fivefold ministry and the
[1:43:32] five-fold ministry is brought for what
[1:43:34] for the perfecting of the Saints that's
[1:43:36] why the devil doesn't want a five-fold
[1:43:37] Ministry because he knows that scripture
[1:43:40] if they just put it to one they won't
[1:43:41] ever be perfected but there's a people
[1:43:43] on the Earth that have read their Bible
