[19:29] every one of these don't we my last
[19:31] brother Gabriel Spencer if he would just
[19:33] come lead us to the throne of grace
[19:36] [Music]
[19:41] before we go to prayer I just want to
[19:42] give a testimony
[19:44] a testimony that
[19:46] I know that God lives and I know that
[19:48] God speaks through his servants and
[19:50] something that happened this week is a
[19:52] prayer that that I've been praying since
[19:54] I got saved and God changed my life
[19:56] brother Shane and this will be big for
[19:58] you because when you told your testimony
[20:01] back on December 19 2021
[20:04] something struck in my life to text
[20:05] Brother Andrew and come up here and say
[20:08] a testimony before he preached
[20:11] and the only reason I know the date is
[20:13] because my sister-in-law was actually
[20:15] watching that day which I would not I
[20:18] was not expecting
[20:19] but that she testified this week that
[20:23] here in hearing God speak through
[20:25] brother Ron and say that they would be
[20:27] there is what caused her to start living
[20:29] a different life
[20:31] and I won't tell their testimony because
[20:33] I believe one day
[20:35] they'll tell it
[20:37] but I got a phone call Sunday night that
[20:40] my brother wanted to be baptized
[20:43] and so as he as he would speak with my
[20:46] dad about that he would go home and tell
[20:48] his wife that he wanted to be baptized
[20:51] she said that that's what she had been
[20:52] praying about and she wanted to be
[20:54] baptized together and he didn't know
[20:56] anything about that so we were able to
[20:58] baptize them at my dad's church this
[21:01] week on Thursday and
[21:03] as well as as well as a sister there
[21:05] that
[21:06] Charity she was able to be a witness to
[21:09] there and there in her life and there
[21:11] was a complete change in her life and
[21:13] she was baptized there as well and I
[21:15] just happen to believe that it doesn't
[21:16] matter where you're at or or where
[21:18] you're going to in your life or where
[21:20] your parents or Sons and Daughters may
[21:22] be at God has a way and he will make a
[21:24] change
[21:26] let's just take these needs to the Lord
[21:28] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just
[21:31] believe that you will come down in a
[21:32] mighty way tonight
[21:34] I believe that this is a this has been a
[21:37] week that you have forwardedained before
[21:38] before the foundation of the world and
[21:41] their sons and daughters coming back
[21:43] home there's there's parents to us here
[21:45] on Earth that will be coming home and
[21:47] and be taking on the blood of Jesus
[21:49] Christ over top of their life and and
[21:52] Lord Jesus I just happen to believe that
[21:54] that there are sons and daughters in
[21:55] seed that that you've placed and and
[21:57] they're they will become awakened and
[21:59] they will be placed in an atmosphere and
[22:01] they will begin to hunger and groan for
[22:03] more of you just as just as the Earth is
[22:06] groaning for a change I'm believing that
[22:08] you will come and you'll you will sweep
[22:10] across our life and they will believe
[22:11] they will see that there there's
[22:13] something more that they need in their
[22:15] life they need they need the baptism of
[22:17] the Holy Ghost in order to make it
[22:19] through what uh what is about to happen
[22:21] and when they get that baptism of the
[22:23] Holy Ghost this tribulation that is that
[22:25] is so amongst us and is right at our
[22:26] doorstep they will be able to miss that
[22:29] because they will be going in the
[22:30] Rapture and receive the token of Life
[22:32] Lord and we see all the all the prayer
[22:34] requests that have been brought forth
[22:35] and we believe that you were the same
[22:37] yesterday today and forever and as you
[22:39] would walk on earth and you would be
[22:41] here using and speaking through the
[22:43] bride today that you can come and you
[22:45] can heal every prayer request that's
[22:46] been brought no matter what the name of
[22:48] the demon that it is that that is
[22:50] fighting your people you can come and
[22:52] you can wipe every every sin clear you
[22:54] can wipe every disease clear and cast
[22:56] every demon back to hell where it came
[22:58] from doctors can give it a name in
[23:00] cancer doctors can give it a name in
[23:02] different depressions or anxieties but
[23:05] Lord Jesus you can come by in a fresh
[23:07] wind tonight a fresh wind that will that
[23:09] will speak the Holy Ghost across and
[23:11] give peace to every situation and
[23:14] Circumstance that we face and Lord Jesus
[23:16] we have we have mighty men that stand
[23:18] here Mighty Men of Valor that you've put
[23:20] as servants and Generals before us but
[23:22] Lord Jesus I ask that you were just
[23:24] anoint brother Kelly anoint him that
[23:26] that sermon that you have placed inside
[23:28] of his life that he will come and he
[23:30] will speak it like he's never spoken
[23:32] before and you'll be able to use him use
[23:34] him tonight and I believe that not only
[23:37] will Souls be returned but there will be
[23:39] healing and there will be cancer cast
[23:40] out of this place cast out of every soul
[23:43] that it tries to turn torment Lord and I

[39:53] home
[39:53] but um you know it's just good to be
[39:56] here and have this time together and it
[40:00] kind of reminiscent of um something that
[40:03] took place about three years ago
[40:06] and we're here in this meeting to
[40:09] celebrate those three years of victory
[40:12] that we've had amen I came in February
[40:17] like I said three years ago brother Ron
[40:19] had been just given days to live and I
[40:23] flew out here with my wife and met
[40:26] brother Donnie's sister Carol here and
[40:28] we had prayer with brother Ron and
[40:31] spirit of fear left him and um you know
[40:35] peace came over his life and we as I the
[40:40] last morning that I was there I woke up
[40:43] in the early morning before I flew out
[40:46] and heard the voice that was coming from
[40:50] another dimension singing that was
[40:52] coming forth that said we shall see
[40:55] Miracles we shall see Giants fall
[40:59] and we have seen Giants fall and we've
[41:02] seen miracles
[41:03] amen
[41:11] I preached that weekend while we were
[41:13] here it was a surprise visit and they
[41:15] graciously asked me to minister but I
[41:18] preached on who hath believed our report
[41:21] and I'll tell you I still believe that
[41:23] report
[41:24] amen I I still know the arm of the Lord
[41:28] his power is being revealed to his
[41:31] people and I'm looking for him to reveal
[41:34] his power even in this meeting this
[41:36] weekend this time that I'll have
[41:38] together amen with our brothers God
[41:40] bless you it's so great to be with you
[41:42] we love you in the Lord
[41:49] Hallelujah
[41:51] amen
[41:53] amen it's an honor to have honor to have
[41:56] our friends here with us this weekend so
[41:58] this this weekend is is a very special
[42:01] weekend to us and to have brother Kelly
[42:04] and brother Tim here together and and to
[42:07] just take in these things I think it's a
[42:09] wonderful thing to have generals to be
[42:10] able to come in and rally around a
[42:12] victory and it's one thing for soldiers
[42:15] to come in and they're they're battling
[42:16] but when generals Gather in it's a real
[42:19] sign of Victory is in the camp and I

[53:02] good to see each and every one of you
[53:04] that are here tonight and
[53:06] look across the audience and I see
[53:08] people that I've not seen before and a
[53:10] lot of old friends that are here today
[53:13] it's just a blessing to be here in the
[53:15] Shenandoah Valley
[53:17] amongst the saints of God here that love
[53:19] the Lord with all their heart and
[53:21] and that continued to serve him with all
[53:24] that's within them
[53:25] we appreciate the invitation of brother
[53:27] Ron Spencer to be here today and
[53:30] and we thank him for it and it's a kind
[53:34] of a little bit of a jubilee time I have
[53:36] brother Ron and brother Tim here with
[53:38] him as well certainly do appreciate both
[53:40] these men of God and they've been such
[53:42] an inspiration in our lives and in our
[53:44] church and our families lives that we we
[53:47] just thank God for a man of God like
[53:49] this and

[53:54] blessing to our people and we really
[53:57] thank the Lord for it we are blessed in
[53:59] this hour to to have people of God in
[54:02] our lives I would give us strength and
[54:04] and encourage Us in the word of God and
[54:07] we thank the Lord for that and we
[54:09] certainly do have a deep appreciation
[54:11] for them and the only problem I have
[54:13] when I come to Virginia is I have to go
[54:15] on a diet a few weeks before I get here
[54:17] because I know for sure that something's
[54:20] going to happen and there's always not a
[54:21] good thing
[54:23] I always tell sister Mara sometimes I
[54:25] said maybe we need to drink two sizes of
[54:27] pants along that way once we get here
[54:30] with and ones we go home with
[54:32] they certainly do take good care of us
[54:34] and we certainly do appreciate their
[54:37] Hospitality they're wonderful people
[54:40] great friends
[54:42] great friends Brother Paul's sister
[54:44] roshani I don't know if I see them where
[54:47] they're sitting

[54:50] back diosi mendiga

[54:54] it's going to have been when I was in in
[54:57] Brazil it was such a blessing to see
[55:00] them in shopico and and
[55:02] got to know them really well there and
[55:04] it's just so nice to see you again and
[55:06] sister Mars looking forward to meeting
[55:08] you all as well
[55:10] amen lord is good sometimes I wonder
[55:14] my neighbors asked me many times where
[55:17] are you going and they said we're going
[55:18] here or there and they said do you know
[55:20] these people I said I might not know
[55:22] them but only take about five minutes
[55:24] and and we'll get to know them they have
[55:26] the same spirit in them that we have in
[55:28] our heart and
[55:30] they said aren't you afraid of it no I
[55:31] said I'm not afraid of them at all
[55:33] I said there's one thing I'm not afraid
[55:36] of I said they're they're wonderful
[55:37] people of the Lord amen aren't you
[55:40] thankful for that
[55:42] because of this message we know so many
[55:44] people around the world and we thank the
[55:47] Lord for it I I think sometimes what it
[55:49] will be like when we get on the other
[55:50] side and and we'll be changed and we'll
[55:53] start shaking hounds with those and say
[55:55] did you remember me here or did you
[55:56] remember me there and and it's just
[55:59] going to be such a glorious glorious
[56:00] time to to meet at that time they're on
[56:03] the table that's been spread for us amen
[56:06] if you have your Bibles this more this
[56:09] evening holler I'd like to turn to
[56:10] Psalms
[56:12] 44 verses 1 to 3 if we would stand
[56:15] tonight
[56:16] and there's three scripture readings I'd
[56:18] like to read if I may Romans 8 11 and
[56:21] First Corinthians 2
[56:23] 4 and 5.
[56:25] First Corinthians 2 4 and 5.
[56:30] are you happy
[56:33] it's good to be here
[56:37] we have heard with our ears
[56:39] oh God our fathers have told us what
[56:43] work thou didst in their day in the
[56:45] times of old how thou did us drive out
[56:48] the Heathen with thy hand and plant and
[56:52] plant as them
[56:53] how thy how thou did US afflict the
[56:57] people and cast them out
[56:59] for they got not the land in possession
[57:02] by their own sword
[57:05] we don't have our own word but we have
[57:07] the word of the Lord
[57:09] neither did their own arms save them
[57:12] we're no match for our enemy but our God
[57:15] is more than able
[57:19] but did their arms save them but thy
[57:22] right hand in thine arm and the light of
[57:24] thy continence because thou hadest a
[57:27] favor upon them
[57:30] is no wonder to be favored of the Lord
[57:33] Romans 8 11 but if the spirit of him
[57:36] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[57:38] in you he that raise up Christ from the
[57:41] dead shall also quickened let's say
[57:43] Quicken tonight
[57:45] say it one more time Quicken Quicken
[57:47] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[57:50] dwelleth in you and then over in First
[57:52] Corinthians 2.
[57:56] verses four and five
[57:59] and my speech and my preaching was not
[58:01] with enticing words of man's Wisdom
[58:05] but in demonstration
[58:07] of the spirit and of power
[58:10] that's your faith
[58:12] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[58:15] but in the power of God Amen God bless
[58:18] you you may have your seats
[58:20] this evening holler for a text tonight
[58:23] I'd like to
[58:25] excuse me look at just a little thought
[58:28] for a few moments of time the church is
[58:31] rising up
[58:33] the church is rising up
[58:36] we are all privileged to be able to live
[58:38] in one of the grandest times that a
[58:40] church people could ever live in
[58:42] that is at the ending of of the Gentile
[58:44] dispensation
[58:46] we're in a time when the weed can
[58:48] recognize very quickly around us through
[58:51] the news and through very different
[58:52] mediums that the coming of the Lord is
[58:55] nigh at hand
[58:57] we also realize that that we're in a
[58:59] season of time where our bodies will be
[59:01] changed from mortality to immortality
[59:04] we're thankful that God has given us a
[59:07] message that has been Vindicated in this
[59:09] last hour
[59:10] a message with the Church of the Living
[59:12] God has has a word of restoration
[59:15] and we have received that message into
[59:17] our lives that message has changed our
[59:20] lives that message has given us a faith
[59:22] in our lives that is unlike any other
[59:24] faith that people could have in any
[59:26] generation
[59:27] amen it's in the hour that we live in
[59:30] today that the Loose Ends that brother
[59:32] Brown who talked about that were left
[59:33] off by Luther and Wesley and even the
[59:36] outporting of the Holy Spirit on the day
[59:38] of Pentecost in 1906 that's coming this
[59:41] hour to bring those to bring those loose
[59:43] ends back into a continuity of the word
[59:46] of God that our faith will not rest in
[59:48] the faith of a man but that our faith
[59:50] would rest in almighty God it is God is
[59:54] the one who is doing the work it's not
[59:56] it's not brother Tim or brother Ron or
[59:58] myself or brother Andrew or whoever the
[1:00:00] minister may be but it's a God and in
[1:00:02] his season of time that God will do
[1:00:04] certain things in order that our faith
[1:00:07] would actually rise in that hour for
[1:00:09] what is before the Church of the Living
[1:00:11] God and I say blessed be the name of the
[1:00:13] Lord I I look at it the wheels of God
[1:00:16] made may turn slowly but they turn true
[1:00:19] and they're on time all the time there
[1:00:22] is nothing out of kilter with God
[1:00:23] sometimes we look at it we may think
[1:00:26] well this seems like the coming of the
[1:00:27] Lord is a long ways off but and and
[1:00:29] maybe from many years ago when I grew up
[1:00:31] in the message it looked like the Lord
[1:00:33] would come any day but I want to say
[1:00:35] that he is coming and he's still coming
[1:00:37] and it could be today could be for any
[1:00:39] one of us but we know the Lord is coming
[1:00:41] we're looking for I'm looking for the
[1:00:44] change in my body I I don't know about
[1:00:46] you all but that's the only message I
[1:00:47] really have is a body change and I'm
[1:00:49] looking for that time when that would
[1:00:51] transpire and I say Lord increase my
[1:00:54] faith in the hour that we're living in
[1:00:56] in order to be able to stand on the hour
[1:00:58] and have my body change in the moment in
[1:01:01] the twinkling of an eye amen I don't
[1:01:03] want to be left behind in this old world
[1:01:05] Amen I've got I've got on my running
[1:01:08] shoes so to speak I'm ready to move on
[1:01:10] Amen I'm no longer we are no longer
[1:01:13] Earthbound creatures we are creatures
[1:01:16] that are Heavenly bound creatures
[1:01:17] therefore in all of us situations of
[1:01:20] life no matter the difficulties in life
[1:01:23] in fact brother Branham says that God
[1:01:25] will actually allow tensions in our life
[1:01:27] and it brings certain things out of our
[1:01:29] life for purposes I believe it's that
[1:01:31] our faith will not rest in this world
[1:01:34] but our faith would rest in the word of
[1:01:36] God Amen if your faith is resting in
[1:01:39] this world it's going to be a real
[1:01:40] terrible place to live in I say tonight
[1:01:43] put your faith in Jesus Christ he's the
[1:01:45] only one that matters he's the one that
[1:01:48] that is going to see you through Amen in
[1:01:51] all the years that I've served the Lord
[1:01:52] I can say with the with all my heart
[1:01:54] that God has never disappointed me God
[1:01:58] has never dis I've disappointed him but
[1:02:00] he's never disappointed me he's always
[1:02:02] been on time in every crisis of life
[1:02:05] amen the bride is supposed to be and I
[1:02:08] believe the bride is moving under the
[1:02:09] unction of the holy spirit in this end
[1:02:11] time hour brother Branham says that if
[1:02:15] the bride will uh says it's in the hour
[1:02:19] and the Bride of Jesus Christ comes into
[1:02:20] full reality it's my words here who she
[1:02:23] is and that she will be an invincible
[1:02:25] Army I believe that we are an invinced
[1:02:27] visible Army amen I believe we are now I
[1:02:30] don't believe it's something afar off
[1:02:32] but I believe it's today we are an
[1:02:34] invincible Army and will continue to be
[1:02:36] Invincible Army because we are to stand
[1:02:39] against the powers of Hell in this hour
[1:02:41] and they're there in this hour and
[1:02:43] they're there to try to destroy us but I
[1:02:45] say greater is he that's in me than he
[1:02:47] that's in the world Amen and God has
[1:02:50] given us great power and authority in
[1:02:52] this hour but it's up to us up to us to
[1:02:55] put it into position and into play and I
[1:02:58] believe that we are doing that amen that
[1:03:01] she will be an invincible arm and be
[1:03:03] able to spiritual naturally discern the
[1:03:06] two Spirits which were which are within
[1:03:08] the framework of the Christian church
[1:03:10] amen and there is two Spirits in it and
[1:03:13] the spirit of the enemy comes in such a
[1:03:16] Sly way brother Brown said I read a
[1:03:18] quote Wednesday night back home where
[1:03:20] where the whole where the enemy will
[1:03:22] come in real slightly it seems like it's
[1:03:24] just barely moving in but he comes in to
[1:03:27] try to move us off the mark But if we're
[1:03:29] fortified let's say I'm fortified
[1:03:31] tonight if we're fortified in Jesus
[1:03:34] Christ we will never be moved off the
[1:03:36] Mark we're going to stand faithful to
[1:03:38] the things of God all the days of our
[1:03:41] life aim until the time of the catching
[1:03:43] away somebody say praise the Lord
[1:03:45] tonight
[1:03:46] amen the brightest should be moving
[1:03:49] under the unction of the Holy Spirit the
[1:03:51] word Invincible in the in the dictionary
[1:03:53] It ultimately means incapable of being
[1:03:56] conquered incapable of being conquered
[1:03:59] and capable of being overcome or
[1:04:02] incapable of being subdued amen and
[1:04:06] incapable is just simply it's impossible
[1:04:08] to be conquered therefore the bride will
[1:04:11] not be conquered if we would not have a
[1:04:14] prophecy in the word of God that says
[1:04:16] God was going to Jesus is going to have
[1:04:18] a bride and that bride is going to be us
[1:04:20] without spot and wrinkle and this second
[1:04:22] Eve will not fall like the first day
[1:04:25] fell amen if we do not have that promise
[1:04:27] we'd be in dire shape in this hour but I
[1:04:30] say tonight we do have a promise and
[1:04:32] that promise is this bride will not be
[1:04:35] defeat defeated in this hour she will
[1:04:37] not be deceived in this hour she's going
[1:04:40] to stand faithful to the word of God and
[1:04:42] there's nothing that will stand in her
[1:04:44] way because she is for a day to go
[1:04:47] through amen and I believe it with all
[1:04:50] that's within my heart amen God is not
[1:04:52] coming for our frivolous woman he's
[1:04:55] coming for a bride of Jesus Christ that
[1:04:58] will stand faithful to the word of God
[1:04:59] in this end time hour I believe we have
[1:05:02] some of those here tonight amen that are
[1:05:05] faithful to the cause of Christ
[1:05:08] it's not a time to play games it's a
[1:05:10] time to be exercised in the word of
[1:05:12] almighty God Amen we know when Satan
[1:05:15] came to tempt Jesus Jesus Jesus didn't
[1:05:17] use any Supernatural power at all to
[1:05:19] resist him to he just use the word of
[1:05:22] God he was the father's word to defeat
[1:05:25] him just the word of the father it is
[1:05:28] written it is written amen and when we
[1:05:31] become fortified we stand with the same
[1:05:33] thing it is written amen and that Spirit
[1:05:36] which was in Jesus Christ was poured out
[1:05:38] on the onto the church on the day of
[1:05:41] Pentecost and it has come upon the Same
[1:05:44] Spirit which is in every which is the
[1:05:47] same spirit and every born again son and
[1:05:49] daughter of God Amen when Jesus gave his
[1:05:52] life for us and that Spirit came back on
[1:05:55] the day of Pentecost that's the same
[1:05:57] spirit that is still here with us
[1:05:59] tonight amen I know sometimes back home
[1:06:02] people want to see the Church of God so
[1:06:05] subdued and and brought down so low and
[1:06:08] don't get too excited and and don't say
[1:06:11] praise God too louder or say hallelujah
[1:06:13] too loud amen but I want to say here
[1:06:15] tonight I resist those spirits in the
[1:06:18] name of the Lord I stand on the word of
[1:06:20] almighty God Amen and there's nobody's
[1:06:23] gonna take my joy from me amen God gave
[1:06:26] you the joy and it's him that gave you
[1:06:28] the joy amen I stand with that joy in my
[1:06:32] heart amen no preacher will take it from
[1:06:35] me
[1:06:36] amen I see it's time to shine it's time
[1:06:40] to lift ourselves up and fly and soar
[1:06:43] into the heavenlies
[1:06:45] Hallelujah
[1:06:47] it's time to move on
[1:06:49] amen I say let the critics be the
[1:06:52] critics
[1:06:53] and if they're streaming tonight I say
[1:06:55] let you be the critic amen it don't
[1:06:58] matter to me as long as I know where I
[1:07:00] am with God as long as you know where
[1:07:03] you are with God what does it matter
[1:07:05] what the critics have to say let them
[1:07:07] say what they want to say payment it's
[1:07:10] time to be Warriors in this hour it's
[1:07:12] time to be an invincible Army in this
[1:07:14] hour
[1:07:17] it's time to shun all those things
[1:07:20] what does it matter what they say
[1:07:23] in the Sardinian Church age brother
[1:07:25] Brown says yes the spirit is not seven
[1:07:28] spirits but one
[1:07:30] he will always be the same and act the
[1:07:33] same
[1:07:33] and the Seven Messengers will have the
[1:07:35] same spirit and teach the same word and
[1:07:38] have the same power
[1:07:40] no he says here and if the church is the
[1:07:42] true church let's say we're the true
[1:07:45] church
[1:07:46] say it one more time we're the true
[1:07:48] church it will have the same spirit and
[1:07:51] word and acts of power that they had at
[1:07:54] Pentecost amen so I say what they have
[1:07:57] there we have it today he said by
[1:08:00] experience it will be a Pentecostal
[1:08:03] church and there will be tongues and
[1:08:05] interpretations and prophecies and
[1:08:08] healings God will be in the midst of her
[1:08:11] and God will declare himself in the
[1:08:14] midst of her as he always has he says
[1:08:17] hallelujah we say hallelujah and she
[1:08:21] will be unorganized and then he says
[1:08:24] three words don't forget that so when
[1:08:27] they try to organize the the spirit of
[1:08:29] the Living God or the word of almighty
[1:08:31] God I say our God cannot be organized
[1:08:34] amen you cannot put God In A Box in this
[1:08:37] hour amen and say he can only move here
[1:08:40] I say our God can move whenever he wants
[1:08:43] to move it's a time for him to move it's
[1:08:47] the time for the church to rise in the
[1:08:49] glory of almighty God and the power of
[1:08:52] almighty God Amen we're not the church
[1:08:55] when brother Brown saw the preview of
[1:08:57] the Bride we're not the one that came up
[1:08:59] and went down where the bride that went
[1:09:01] on into glory and will continue to march
[1:09:04] on into glory in all the power of the
[1:09:07] resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:09:10] Hallelujah
[1:09:12] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:09:15] we have a sure word of Prophecy
[1:09:18] it's not just a half word it's a sure
[1:09:20] word
[1:09:22] it's something it's something that we
[1:09:24] hold in our heart
[1:09:26] it's something that's real in our lives
[1:09:29] something happened in our hearts
[1:09:31] something happened in our lives
[1:09:33] some people say explain it to me I can't
[1:09:36] explain it all I know is that something
[1:09:39] happened and when that happened in my
[1:09:41] life I've never been the same after that
[1:09:43] time
[1:09:44] amen something changed and my faith is
[1:09:47] not in us in a man but my faith is in
[1:09:49] the power and the word of almighty God
[1:09:51] that's where my faith my faith lies
[1:09:55] how sometimes they they're trying to
[1:09:57] shut down preachers they're trying to
[1:09:59] shut down a lot of things but I'll say
[1:10:01] they're never going to shut down the
[1:10:02] true five-fold Ministry you let the
[1:10:05] people can go and do what they want to
[1:10:06] do but the people of the that are the
[1:10:09] Bride of Jesus Christ will not be shut
[1:10:11] down by any organization by anything
[1:10:14] that would come against the power of the
[1:10:16] Church of the Living God it's in this
[1:10:18] hour that we stand faithful to the cause
[1:10:21] of Christ
[1:10:22] amen it's not time to back up it's time
[1:10:25] to go forward in the name of the Lord
[1:10:27] and the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:30] amen we should be expecting God to move
[1:10:33] in every service we should be expecting
[1:10:35] God to move in our houses we should
[1:10:37] expect God to move on the job and we're
[1:10:39] working on the job ain't it because some
[1:10:42] Dynamics has got a hold of our soul and
[1:10:45] has changed us in this hour
[1:10:47] Amen Let the Church of the Lord's redeem
[1:10:50] say so
[1:10:54] Hallelujah
[1:10:58] in the message which is a very familiar
[1:11:00] quote I know you all know these quotes
[1:11:02] that I'm reading but just let me let me
[1:11:04] share them with you
[1:11:06] and the rising of the Sun the first
[1:11:08] sheath came up from all the prophets
[1:11:10] which was the son of God he was the king
[1:11:12] of all the prophets
[1:11:14] there's been churches churches and
[1:11:16] Brides brides and churches and Brides
[1:11:19] brides but there's got to come one
[1:11:21] Hallelujah there has to come a real
[1:11:25] bride I believe thou with all my heart
[1:11:27] there must come one that's not only got
[1:11:30] mechanics but the Dynamics of it it
[1:11:33] makes the church live I like that when
[1:11:35] he says that it makes the church live
[1:11:37] amen I'm brother Tim I'm going to share
[1:11:39] this from him that God gave us a car I
[1:11:41] mean excuse me brother brownham had a
[1:11:43] car running but it's been all the quack
[1:11:45] preachers excuse me mechanics have been
[1:11:47] working on it caused that car not to run
[1:11:49] and I'll tell you if you get everything
[1:11:51] in order on a car it's going to start
[1:11:54] and it's going to run
[1:11:56] I I did some mechanical work one time
[1:11:58] that was not a good idea
[1:12:00] I'll finish this in a moment here it was
[1:12:02] not a good idea
[1:12:03] I thought I could be a mechanic too that
[1:12:05] was before YouTube
[1:12:07] of course YouTube bails you out if
[1:12:09] you're not a mechanic it makes you a
[1:12:10] mechanic overnight
[1:12:12] just go to watch 10 minutes of it and
[1:12:14] all I'm a Certified mechanic
[1:12:16] well I didn't have that I was no
[1:12:17] Certified mechanic and I had all my my
[1:12:20] wires wrong I thought I'd remember which
[1:12:22] one went from the distributor maybe some
[1:12:24] people nor Distributors where the power
[1:12:26] comes through to the plug I thought I
[1:12:29] would remember him but I couldn't
[1:12:31] remember it
[1:12:32] and so I put those wires on the way I
[1:12:34] thought they were supposed to go on that
[1:12:36] car never started our truck never
[1:12:38] started it didn't run there was nothing
[1:12:40] to it but when there was a Certified
[1:12:43] mechanic that came by and he took and he
[1:12:45] put every spark plug on the right spot
[1:12:48] where it needed to go on in the right
[1:12:49] cylinder when you went into that car you
[1:12:52] just turned the ignition and that car
[1:12:54] started running hey man did I believe in
[1:12:56] this hour that's exactly what God is
[1:12:58] doing this hour through the fivefold
[1:13:00] ministry amen they're putting this car
[1:13:03] back in order again so this car can run
[1:13:06] in this hour hey man and it's gonna run
[1:13:09] all the way to glory land
[1:13:11] hallelujah it's not time to sit around
[1:13:15] and mope around it's time to turn on the
[1:13:17] car
[1:13:18] [Applause]
[1:13:20] and then let it run
[1:13:23] and I believe when we see the power of
[1:13:25] God moving to the church it changes
[1:13:27] people
[1:13:33] there must come one that's not gonna
[1:13:34] only got mechanics but the Dynamics of
[1:13:36] it makes that church live
[1:13:39] amen we we know that
[1:13:42] moving the power of his resurrection
[1:13:44] until we come to that place until we
[1:13:47] find that place what good does it do to
[1:13:49] do a polished job what good does it do
[1:13:51] to give it a facelift or a simonizing
[1:13:54] job when there's no Dynamics in him no
[1:13:58] matter how much the mechanics prove to
[1:14:00] be right there's got to be a Dynamics to
[1:14:04] make it work hey man and I can we can
[1:14:06] say tonight the Dynamics are here to
[1:14:09] make the church move
[1:14:10] amen but Iowa we're not just moving on a
[1:14:13] road out so to speak we're we're moving
[1:14:15] up into glory land when he saw the
[1:14:17] preview of the Bride it was the church
[1:14:19] that went down but it was a bride that
[1:14:22] kept moving on Amen now there was a few
[1:14:25] out of out of place but he stood in his
[1:14:27] own room and he screamed out get back in
[1:14:30] line get back in line get back in line
[1:14:33] amen I say Lord if we're not in line
[1:14:36] then I say Lord then put us back in line
[1:14:38] in this hour it's time for a body chain
[1:14:41] it's time to rise and shine
[1:14:45] Hallelujah
[1:14:49] the church should be moving in the power
[1:14:51] of the Holy Spirit
[1:14:52] amen
[1:14:54] which will cause the church to rise into
[1:14:56] the heavenlies
[1:14:57] amen the angel of God didn't leave the
[1:14:59] church and the prophet left he's still
[1:15:02] here
[1:15:03] he's still here
[1:15:05] and he will be here until we're gone
[1:15:08] hey man some people think oh when
[1:15:10] brother Branham left in the pillar far
[1:15:12] left he said oh no it did not
[1:15:14] no it's still here
[1:15:16] they say well you got on a picture on a
[1:15:18] wall that really that's pictures on the
[1:15:20] wall just to testify that God was here
[1:15:22] and and he stood over his Prophet to
[1:15:25] vindicate that hey man I thank God for
[1:15:27] that picture amen but I don't need to
[1:15:30] see another picture to know if he's here
[1:15:32] or not I can feel him in that power of
[1:15:34] his resurrection I can feel the dynamic
[1:15:37] power of Jesus Christ moving
[1:15:40] he's here
[1:15:46] we were just in in Brazil in January at
[1:15:49] a youth convention
[1:15:52] and the peace on the people came up to
[1:15:54] me afterwards he said they visibly saw
[1:15:56] the pillar of fire in the meeting
[1:15:58] he's still here
[1:16:00] I know he's here with you as well
[1:16:02] but it's good to testify of it
[1:16:05] amen he's the Living God
[1:16:08] in the message hearing and recognizing
[1:16:10] he says look at the carnal Church look
[1:16:12] where they're they're going to farther
[1:16:14] and farther away
[1:16:17] look at the Spirit-filled church shaking
[1:16:19] off all its little nonsense
[1:16:22] coming up in the spirit
[1:16:24] in the minority of course
[1:16:27] coming in the spirit but moving up
[1:16:32] such a place still as God there to where
[1:16:34] the holy spirit's moving right through
[1:16:36] it working its way ready to receive her
[1:16:40] Lord ready to receive her Lord
[1:16:43] amen I just want to read that one more
[1:16:45] time look at the Spirit-filled church
[1:16:47] shaking off all its little nonsense
[1:16:51] coming up in the spirit I say shaking
[1:16:54] off a lot of nonsense a formality
[1:16:57] a lot of nonsense of intellectualism
[1:17:00] a lot of nonsense of lukewarmness
[1:17:03] because it was Satan's desire to make
[1:17:05] the church lukewarm formal and Powerless
[1:17:07] but it was God's desire to put a spirit
[1:17:10] in the church in the individual's lives
[1:17:12] amen and the spirit is greater than the
[1:17:15] lukewarmness and and the formalities and
[1:17:18] so forth amen and that's I don't I don't
[1:17:21] understand it why do people think they
[1:17:23] need five steps to get to get something
[1:17:25] out of their life would I hear that in
[1:17:28] the Church of the Living God it makes my
[1:17:30] heart want to scream out amen we don't
[1:17:32] need no five steps of this or ten steps
[1:17:35] of that or we don't need to have no
[1:17:37] psychology in the house of the Lord to
[1:17:40] get delivered I'll tell you what you
[1:17:42] need you need the power of the Holy
[1:17:44] Spirit just drop down one time it will
[1:17:47] change your life
[1:17:49] it will make you a new creature in
[1:17:51] Christ Jesus
[1:17:54] I read sometimes they gotta get rid of
[1:17:57] pornography let's have five steps or ten
[1:18:00] steps I say you don't need no steps well
[1:18:02] you need is one step at the altar and
[1:18:05] let the Holy Ghost come down and change
[1:18:07] your life that's what you need in this
[1:18:10] hour
[1:18:10] [Applause]
[1:18:13] but the problem of it is is they have
[1:18:15] taken the spirit of formality and the
[1:18:18] spirit of lukewarmness and they've lost
[1:18:20] the power of the Living God they don't
[1:18:22] want God to move anymore but I'm here to
[1:18:25] declare tonight that God still moves in
[1:18:27] this hour and will continue to move
[1:18:32] he's almighty God
[1:18:35] we should shake ourselves from these
[1:18:37] spirits of unbelief
[1:18:39] amen put into action what was left to
[1:18:42] the church which was a Holy Ghost Field
[1:18:44] Church
[1:18:45] Mark 16 in action
[1:18:47] I know you hear these things every week
[1:18:49] no doubt but just bear with me for a
[1:18:52] while
[1:18:52] let me share what's on my heart tonight
[1:18:55] hey man it's time that we realize who we
[1:18:58] are in Christ Jesus we're not we're not
[1:19:01] the denominational flavor we have been
[1:19:04] favored by almighty God we have the
[1:19:07] king's sword in our hand
[1:19:10] foreign
[1:19:15] don't don't take it personal
[1:19:18] I am happy
[1:19:20] Sister Sister Mara told me one time you
[1:19:22] need to smile a little more when you
[1:19:23] preach
[1:19:24] people think you're angry all the time
[1:19:28] it's good to have sister Myra with me I
[1:19:29] forgot to welcome her before
[1:19:32] good to have her here
[1:19:33] [Applause]
[1:19:41] she's my queen
[1:19:46] Mark 16 15 18. okay what are you done
[1:19:49] and he said unto them going to all the
[1:19:51] world preach the gospel of every
[1:19:52] creature
[1:19:54] I'm glad he said preach
[1:19:56] through the foolishness of the preaching
[1:19:59] men shall be saved
[1:20:03] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:20:05] be saved
[1:20:06] that's pretty simple
[1:20:08] but he that believeth not shall be
[1:20:10] damned
[1:20:12] and these signs that say these signs
[1:20:14] shall follow them that believe in my
[1:20:16] name
[1:20:17] they shall cast all devils you know it's
[1:20:20] amazing Jesus never gave a form you'll
[1:20:21] have 10 steps
[1:20:23] he gave us Formula One Step
[1:20:25] One Moment in the presence of God
[1:20:29] amen
[1:20:30] cast out Devils they shall speak with
[1:20:32] new tongues
[1:20:34] you know I grew up in in a time when
[1:20:36] they they thought all those things were
[1:20:37] on their Shelf
[1:20:39] but what I found out is that is that
[1:20:41] they didn't want them working in the
[1:20:42] church because they would call out sin
[1:20:43] in their life
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:49] I remember when I started study in the
[1:20:51] message
[1:20:52] and I started to realize that brother
[1:20:54] Brown said and all what some preacher
[1:20:55] told me
[1:20:56] my brother Brown who said the gifts were
[1:20:58] put in the church to keep the church
[1:20:59] clean
[1:21:00] I'll tell you what
[1:21:02] you have that working in your church
[1:21:04] you're going to find a different
[1:21:05] atmosphere in all of our churches
[1:21:07] people aren't just going to slide in and
[1:21:09] just think they're going to stay
[1:21:10] underneath the underneath their sin
[1:21:12] thing they're going to get called up by
[1:21:14] the Holy Ghost
[1:21:16] amen God has a way of doing it there's a
[1:21:18] reason why there's nine spiritual gifts
[1:21:20] that are put into the body they're there
[1:21:22] to help the body
[1:21:24] amen they're gifts that are put into the
[1:21:26] church God maybe use the person one time
[1:21:28] but that may be the only time that he
[1:21:30] needs to use them for whatever the
[1:21:31] purpose may be
[1:21:33] amen
[1:21:34] they shall speak with new tongues they
[1:21:36] shall take up serpents and if they drink
[1:21:38] any deadly thing has shown all hurt them
[1:21:40] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:21:41] they shall recover amen and we believe
[1:21:44] that with all of our heart
[1:21:45] amen sometimes we think we always want
[1:21:48] to see things so so quickly but God has
[1:21:50] his own timing for everything
[1:21:53] amen
[1:21:55] I also want to read from infallibility
[1:21:57] of God's spoken word
[1:21:59] when he came he he came through a virgin
[1:22:01] God made his promise sure he was stuck
[1:22:04] he stuck with his word every word of it
[1:22:07] had to be so he made it perfect because
[1:22:09] he was God and couldn't do nothing else
[1:22:11] he had to stay with it notice the next
[1:22:14] thing
[1:22:15] that he next thing he had to do the
[1:22:17] church had to be anointed and sent out
[1:22:19] before he could keep his promise he had
[1:22:22] to make a way for this church to be
[1:22:23] anointed and the church after Walking
[1:22:26] With Jesus and knowing Jesus and had
[1:22:28] received power to heal the sick and do
[1:22:30] everything and all these ups and downs
[1:22:32] of things they had and yet walk with G
[1:22:34] and yet Walk With Jesus he know that he
[1:22:38] had to make a way to send his church out
[1:22:40] anointed
[1:22:42] amen it was why he was not just going to
[1:22:44] send them up without an anointing he was
[1:22:46] going to send them with an anointing
[1:22:49] amen when people want to take the
[1:22:50] anointing out of the church that church
[1:22:53] is just dead and gone
[1:22:55] he sent them up to Jerusalem and they
[1:22:57] went into the upper room and stayed
[1:22:58] there for ten days and nights until
[1:22:59] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[1:23:01] like a rushing Mighty Wind that filled
[1:23:03] all the house where they were sitting
[1:23:04] God made a way to anoint his church and
[1:23:07] to spread her Gates across the ages

[1:23:12] ages across the Nations rather and

[1:23:55] why we should be revived every day of
[1:23:58] our life amen we should be in Revival
[1:24:01] all the time amen sometimes that's not

[1:24:05] Revival but I want to have Revival in my
[1:24:08] life every day amen when I come to the

[1:28:55] in the lives of the people

[1:31:02] but you know when we come to the house
[1:31:04] of the Lord this is my life this is our
[1:31:06] life
[1:31:07] I mean why why do we have to sit back
[1:31:10] and and say okay I can't I can't jump I
[1:31:13] can't show I can't I can't dance I can't
[1:31:16] I can't I go all this I can't I can't

[1:31:19] they all get happy when they leave
[1:31:21] church they say oh you're not happy in
[1:31:23] the house of the Lord but when you leave
[1:31:25] the house of God and you stand outside
[1:31:26] and you sit there yeah did you see this
[1:31:28] movie I just saw the other day think
[1:31:30] what in the world where are the people
[1:31:31] at
[1:31:32] they're certainly not getting ready for
[1:31:33] a rapture
[1:31:34] they should be talking about what God's
[1:31:36] doing in their lives amen God's moving
[1:31:39] in our lives amen it's time to rise and
[1:31:42] shine Church hope this is okay tonight
[1:31:46] I was gonna go a little different way
[1:31:47] and the Lord kind of brought me this way
[1:31:48] and I thought well this is what it is
[1:31:50] tonight
[1:31:52] amen
[1:31:53] further down he said that's what he
[1:31:55] proved Hallelujah that's what Easter
[1:31:57] proved he wasn't only the word but he
[1:31:58] was God himself the Dynamics and the
[1:32:00] word that made the body of Jesus Christ
[1:32:02] cold and stiff and dead in the grave
[1:32:03] shaken to life rise again and rolled
[1:32:06] away the stone I am he that was dead so
[1:32:08] dead Till The Sun said he was dead the
[1:32:10] moon said he was dead the star said he
[1:32:12] was dead all nature said he was dead and
[1:32:14] now the whole world has to recognize
[1:32:16] that he's alive again he was not only
[1:32:18] the mechanics God's word he was a
[1:32:20] Dynamics to prove it and as he being the
[1:32:23] groom the bride has to come forth
[1:32:25] because it's part of him and it can only
[1:32:27] be met be the manifestation of the
[1:32:29] fulfilling of all let's say all tonight
[1:32:31] all the revelations that others have
[1:32:34] spoken of the Bride if it does something
[1:32:36] different from the groom it isn't the
[1:32:38] bride because she is flesh of his flesh
[1:32:40] bone of his bone life of his blind life
[1:32:42] she is power of his power she is him in
[1:32:46] this hour and we can say that that's who
[1:32:48] we are we are him amen the bride becomes
[1:32:51] an exact uh reflection of Jesus Christ
[1:32:55] Our Lord whatever the scripture says it
[1:32:57] fulfilled who Jesus Christ was we are
[1:33:00] fulfilling our part in the word of God
[1:33:03] amen no matter how much we can sound and
[1:33:06] prove the message to be right but there
[1:33:07] has to be something in our lives to move
[1:33:09] us higher in Christ amen we can prove it
[1:33:13] I don't they can they can prove it it's
[1:33:15] all actually but you look at their life
[1:33:16] and they can they can't even live an
[1:33:18] overcoming life but if the power of the
[1:33:20] holy spirit is in our life amen and
[1:33:23] moving in our life we're we're not going
[1:33:25] to be Earthbound any longer we're going
[1:33:27] to be Heavenly bound we're going to move
[1:33:29] higher in Christ Jesus what keeps us
[1:33:31] bogged down is little besetting things
[1:33:34] in our in our lives amen and if we could
[1:33:36] ever lay those things down one time amen
[1:33:39] we'll realize how free we can be coming
[1:33:42] to Christ amen if God has ever done
[1:33:44] anything I can see why people can't show
[1:33:46] because they've never experienced God in
[1:33:48] a supernatural way but when you
[1:33:51] experience God in a supernatural way he
[1:33:53] became my healer amen he he's my see he
[1:33:57] became my salvation he became everything
[1:33:59] to me amen the least I can do is give
[1:34:02] glory and praise unto him for what he's
[1:34:04] done unto me amen people think well why
[1:34:07] do people want to run why do they want
[1:34:08] to show I'll tell you why they want to
[1:34:10] run and why they want to show up because
[1:34:12] because something has happened amen the
[1:34:15] things that used to bother them they
[1:34:17] don't bother them anymore amen because
[1:34:19] Christ came into their life in a
[1:34:21] supernatural way amen every one of us is
[1:34:24] a supernatural creation of God Amen and
[1:34:27] we should be glad and rejoice
[1:34:30] for what Jesus Christ has done excuse me
[1:34:33] for my coughing
[1:34:35] for what Christ has done for us amen
[1:34:38] when I was sick he became my healer amen
[1:34:41] when I was depressed he became
[1:34:42] everything and became my joy amen when I
[1:34:45] was down and out he lifted me up again
[1:34:48] amen and somebody wants to tell me I
[1:34:50] can't praise God I'm going to praise God
[1:34:52] in the morning I'm going to praise him
[1:34:55] at noon time I'm going to praise my God
[1:35:00] it's time to praise him it's time to
[1:35:04] worship him it's time to let your voices
[1:35:07] know what side you're on
[1:35:10] it's time to let the people know that
[1:35:13] Christ Is My All In All thank again
[1:35:15] happy and evolving I'm gonna get happy

[1:35:26] Lives
[1:35:26] it's time to get out of the dumps
[1:35:30] and thank God for his grace you may say
[1:35:33] well I got problems in my life he makes
[1:35:36] it that way for us amen because he wants
[1:35:39] to see what side of the fence will we be
[1:35:41] on
[1:35:43] I know that's hard for us to take in
[1:35:45] this age of soft living that we have but
[1:35:48] it's good for us anyhow we gotta make
[1:35:50] decisions in this hour as for me and my
[1:35:53] house I'm gonna serve the Lord with all
[1:35:56] my heart
[1:35:59] [Applause]
[1:36:01] Hallelujah
[1:36:05] the Holy Ghost should be working in our
[1:36:07] lives
[1:36:09] we say oh
[1:36:11] if everything's going our way oh man we
[1:36:13] can get happy but we should be happy
[1:36:15] when things aren't going our way
[1:36:17] we want to move higher in Christ we want
[1:36:19] to get out of here
[1:36:21] hey man and we're gonna get out of here

[1:36:35] if I'm up or down we get up and we get
[1:36:38] down sometimes it takes us a few days to
[1:36:40] get over it amen but I want to say that
[1:36:42] our anchor holds in Christ hey man I'll
[1:36:45] never repeat all my love for Jesus
[1:36:47] Christ
[1:36:49] it holds
[1:36:51] in Christ the word
[1:36:53] Hallelujah
[1:36:55] when I hear the prophet saying you never
[1:36:57] did it in the first place
[1:36:59] hey man that ought to make somebody want
[1:37:01] to get happy
[1:37:02] amen when they when the by when he said

[1:37:06] forgetfulness you weren't married to to

[1:38:59] a Christian
[1:39:00] being born in church is a wonderful
[1:39:02] thing to hear the word of the Lord but
[1:39:04] you've got to come down to a personal
[1:39:06] experience between you and almighty God

[1:39:55] gone
[1:39:57] I never started the work I won't finish

[1:41:28] one of the most beautiful times of the
[1:41:31] year is the resurrection of Our Lord
[1:41:33] amen because there speaks of of your
[1:41:35] change it speaks of what he's done for
[1:41:37] us
[1:41:38] amen and what he's going to do to the
[1:41:40] Church of the Living God Amen if if he
[1:41:43] raised himself up under the grave when
[1:41:46] he says on that day that those that
[1:41:48] sleep in the grave will come forth
[1:41:49] they're going to come forth somebody say
[1:41:52] are they going to come forth brother
[1:41:53] Kelly I said it's not up to me to know

[1:42:01] how he's going to change me but I'm
[1:42:03] Gonna Change

[1:42:08] the church should be full of power
[1:42:10] with 121 into the upper room they were
[1:42:12] cowards but when they came out
[1:42:15] they had something different in their
[1:42:17] heart
[1:42:18] they had some dynamics that were moving
[1:42:20] in their life
[1:42:22] amen
[1:42:23] God of this evil age for us that you're
[1:42:25] not germ of natural life is brought down
[1:42:27] germatized from father to father to
[1:42:29] father so is the Life of Christ German
[1:42:31] ties
[1:42:32] that's the reason God uses Elijah's
[1:42:34] Spirit five times what is it's a handing
[1:42:37] down just as your natural life and
[1:42:39] traits is handed down from the natural
[1:42:41] breeding of your father so is the spirit
[1:42:43] of God that was predestining before the
[1:42:45] foundation of the world that's why
[1:42:47] predestination is so important to us
[1:42:50] amen predestination is important because
[1:42:52] our names are written in the last book
[1:42:53] of life before the foundation of the
[1:42:56] world
[1:42:57] amen it's not oh there's a new name
[1:42:58] written down in heaven and it's mine
[1:43:00] brother Brown said that song sounded
[1:43:02] good but it was there all it was just
[1:43:04] wrong
[1:43:04] because there's no new new names written
[1:43:07] down in heaven and it's mine my name was
[1:43:09] written a long time ago before I even
[1:43:11] even knew about my name written down in
[1:43:13] heaven it was already written down in
[1:43:14] heaven amen and that name was written
[1:43:17] there Amen brother Brown took a picture
[1:43:19] of you how you would look in the
[1:43:21] Millennium and he put in the followers
[1:43:23] predestination we're on our way to that
[1:43:26] picture amen and one day that picture
[1:43:29] will be unveiled and revealed amen I'll
[1:43:32] be back in a young body you'll be back
[1:43:34] on a young body amen somebody say praise
[1:43:37] the Lord
[1:43:40] Hallelujah
[1:43:42] predestinated for a foundation world to
[1:43:44] win the entire word of God incomplete
[1:43:46] was headed up in a human body called
[1:43:48] Jesus Christ and their God made me pay
[1:43:50] for my sins thank you Jesus and him
[1:43:53] there then he rose me and raised me up
[1:43:55] with him in the resurrection and now
[1:43:58] let's say now and now we are seated with
[1:44:01] him with power and authority over every
[1:44:03] devil oh if they can only believe what
[1:44:05] God has given but if you're not seated
[1:44:08] there you don't have it and if you're
[1:44:10] seated there and don't believe it and
[1:44:12] afraid to move you'll never use it but
[1:44:14] if you are seated there let's say I'm
[1:44:16] seated there he says you will use it for
[1:44:19] your ordained to do what you do amen and
[1:44:23] I say this exactly we are ordained to do
[1:44:26] what we do
[1:44:29] amen
[1:44:31] this bride is going to be an invincible
[1:44:33] Army
[1:44:34] brother Brown says when she realizes it
[1:44:37] gets a true revelation of the two
[1:44:38] Spirits within the framework of the
[1:44:40] Christian church he will be an
[1:44:42] invincible Army
[1:44:43] it's not if she will be we are an
[1:44:46] invisible Army
[1:44:47] and by and he says that by God's spirit
[1:44:49] desire to withstand the Antichrist
[1:44:51] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:44:52] her amen I believe that
[1:44:55] with all my heart I believe it today
[1:44:58] he will be as definitely for it today as
[1:45:01] when Christ withstood his every effort
[1:45:03] to gain power over him in the desert yes
[1:45:04] Satan hates Revelation but we love it
[1:45:06] we're true Revelation in our lives the
[1:45:08] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail but we
[1:45:11] let's say we
[1:45:12] we will prevail over them
[1:45:14] amen

[1:45:18] the two Spirits Invincible Army our army
[1:45:22] that can't be beaten

[1:45:27] strengths
[1:45:28] one uses one weapon the other one uses a
[1:45:30] bit of a weapon they keep tests and
[1:45:32] their strength
[1:45:33] but this Army has gotten already tested
[1:45:36] what will work
[1:45:37] through his son Christ Jesus and it's
[1:45:39] the spirit of Christ that came back on
[1:45:41] the church
[1:45:42] amen this arm this church WIll withstand
[1:45:44] the power

[1:45:52] version and then just a few moments and

[1:45:59] praise the Lord
[1:46:02] have a cuck 3 18 to 19 the Amplified
[1:46:07] says yet I will rejoice in the Lord
[1:46:10] I will exalt in the glory and the
[1:46:13] Victorious God
[1:46:14] of my salvation
[1:46:17] that word exalt means to be extremely
[1:46:19] joyful to leap for joy
[1:46:22] yet I will rejoice in the Lord I will
[1:46:24] jump for joy in the Victorious God
[1:46:28] of my salvation
[1:46:31] verse 19 in the Amplified
[1:46:34] the Lord God is my strength
[1:46:37] my personal bravery
[1:46:39] and my Invincible Army
[1:46:41] he makes my feet like Heinz feet and
[1:46:44] will make me to walk not to stand still
[1:46:46] in Terror but to walk and make spiritual
[1:46:50] progress upon my high places of trouble

[1:46:56] chief musician with the string
[1:46:57] instruments amen the Lord God is my
[1:47:00] strength

[1:47:09] too much
[1:47:10] one time I know if I ever told you this
[1:47:12] story here
[1:47:13] I went to get my mail one day
[1:47:16] man that was a roughest day of my life
[1:47:19] I opened my mailbox was right by by a
[1:47:21] yard we have those mailboxes you have to
[1:47:24] open them and get your mail out of them
[1:47:26] and uh the the door opened
[1:47:29] and here's two bulldogs
[1:47:32] they were standing right here and I was
[1:47:34] standing right here
[1:47:35] and I thought dear Lord now what do I do
[1:47:38] this is not a good idea
[1:47:41] that's not a good idea
[1:47:43] so I finally went and I got onto a good
[1:47:46] guy's truck he had a hardcover on the
[1:47:48] top I stood on top of his truck and I
[1:47:49] called
[1:47:50] here the guy walked out here's the guy

[1:48:01] I'm not going to find out if they are or
[1:48:02] they're not
[1:48:04] I'm not about to find out
[1:48:08] if I look at my own bravery I'm not
[1:48:10] going to get very far
[1:48:11] but when Christ becomes my personal
[1:48:13] bravery
[1:48:15] when he becomes your personal bravery
[1:48:18] that's a whole different thing
[1:48:21] he becomes your Invincible Army see on
[1:48:24] our own we're no Army

[1:49:19] and in my soul
[1:49:21] it stirs me up to a place you hardly
[1:49:23] know what to do with yourself

[1:51:26] preached that sermon and that brother
[1:51:28] stood there who hadn't been in church
