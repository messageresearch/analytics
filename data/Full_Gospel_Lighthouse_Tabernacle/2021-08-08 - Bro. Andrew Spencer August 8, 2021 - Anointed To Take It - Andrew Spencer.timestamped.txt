[43:08] almighty
[43:09] i will say of the lord he is my refuge
[43:12] and my fortress my god and him will i
[43:15] trust
[43:16] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[43:18] snare of the fowler and from the noisome
[43:20] pestilence
[43:22] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[43:24] and under his wings shalt thou trust
[43:26] his truth shall be thy shield and
[43:29] buckler
[43:30] thou shall not be afraid for the terror
[43:32] by night nor for the error that flight
[43:34] by day
[43:35] nor for the pestilence that walketh in
[43:37] darkness nor for the destruction that
[43:40] wasteth at noonday
[43:42] a thousand shall fall at thy side and
[43:44] ten thousand at thy right hand but it
[43:46] shall not come nigh thee
[43:48] only with thine eyes shalt thou behold
[43:50] and see the reward of the wicked because
[43:53] thou has made the lord which is my
[43:55] refuge even the most high thy habitation
[43:59] there shall no evil befall thee neither
[44:01] shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling
[44:04] for he shall give his angels charge over
[44:06] thee to keep thee in all thy ways they
[44:08] shall bear thee up in their hands unlest
[44:11] thou dash thy foot against a stone
[44:13] thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder
[44:16] the young lion and the dragon shall thou
[44:18] trample under their feet
[44:20] because he hath set his love upon me
[44:22] therefore will i deliver him and i will
[44:24] set him on high because he hath known my

[50:14] things that you once said this morning

[50:19] numbers chapter 13 and verse 30
[50:22] and caleb still the people before moses
[50:25] and said let us go up at once
[50:28] and possess it
[50:29] for we are well able to overcome it and
[50:33] as you turn into revelations
[50:35] chapter 10
[50:37] and verse 7
[50:38] and the world is again falling apart he
[50:40] said let me tell you what we need today
[50:42] is the word of god anointed for this age
[50:46] that will bring forth the power of the
[50:48] holy ghost again
[50:50] this morning i'd like to speak to you on
[50:52] an anointed
[50:54] to take it
[50:55] anointed to take it revelations chapter
[50:58] 10 and verse 7
[50:59] but in the days of the voice of the
[51:01] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[51:03] sound the mystery of god should be
[51:05] finished as he hath declared to his
[51:08] servants the prophets and the voice
[51:11] which i heard from heaven spake unto me
[51:13] again and said go and take the little
[51:16] book which is open in the hand of the
[51:18] angel which standeth upon the sea
[51:20] and upon the earth and i went unto the
[51:23] angel and said unto him give me the
[51:25] little book and he said unto me take it
[51:28] and eat it up and it shall make thy
[51:30] belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[51:32] mouth
[51:33] sweet as honey and i took the little
[51:35] book out of the angel's hand and ate it
[51:38] up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey
[51:40] and as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[51:43] was bitter and he said unto me thou must
[51:46] prophesy again before many peoples and
[51:49] nations and tongues
[51:51] and kings may god bless his word you may
[51:54] be seated this morning in the presence
[51:56] of the lord as we said we'd like to
[51:58] speak to you on anointed to take it and
[52:00] i'll ask you just to have your your your
[52:03] spiritual thinking cap on this morning
[52:05] as we go through these things but we
[52:07] know that that god throughout his word
[52:09] has laced it through there that god was
[52:11] going to have a people and he would have
[52:13] a church that would be a spotless church
[52:16] that would be a church that was called
[52:18] after his namesake and and we know that
[52:22] god is going to god is going to make
[52:24] sure that she comes out exactly the way
[52:27] that he has destined her to be
[52:29] and she is anointed for this hour for
[52:31] the challenge of the hour to make to to
[52:34] make sure that this word gets through
[52:36] and we're very acquainted as message
[52:39] believers with with the reading of
[52:41] revelations chapter 10 but we realize
[52:43] that that the book of revelation is is
[52:46] is in symbols and we see that here we
[52:49] look in revelations chapter 10 it's a
[52:52] continuation over from revelations
[52:55] chapter 9 and the bible said and i saw
[52:58] another mighty angel come down from
[53:00] heaven and we realize that that was none
[53:03] other than our lord jesus christ and we
[53:06] see that john here throughout the book
[53:08] of revelations that john
[53:10] is a type of the bride to go unto the
[53:14] angel and to take the book out of the
[53:17] hand of the angel now now so you
[53:19] understand that that he is taking that
[53:21] out of the hand of the mighty angel that
[53:24] has given that revelation but this
[53:26] church that god is building you see he
[53:29] come to build himself a body that could
[53:32] that could be called by his name that
[53:34] would carry his characteristics and his
[53:36] identification that she would be
[53:38] connected with the headship of christ
[53:40] and god is going to have a church
[53:43] amen god is going to have a church and
[53:45] brother branham said that she would be a
[53:47] token to the world and so if we go to
[53:51] looking at this word to to go in and to
[53:54] take the book if you look at that word
[53:57] in the greek it is lambeno
[53:59] which which we see it means to receive
[54:03] to take it means to have or to catch or
[54:06] to take or to take with the hand to lay
[54:09] hold of to take up of a thing to be
[54:11] carried up
[54:12] upon oneself to claim to procure for
[54:16] oneself and so john here is a type of
[54:20] you is that right this morning john is a
[54:22] type of you going and to procure the the
[54:26] open book that has been opened which you
[54:29] look over and you see just a few
[54:31] chapters before it was a closed book but
[54:33] now john is going and taking that little
[54:37] book which is open and that word lambeno
[54:40] can also be found throughout the bible
[54:42] in john chapter one and eleven he came
[54:45] unto his own
[54:46] and his own received him not but as many
[54:49] as a lambano as many as took him as many
[54:53] as caught him as many as lay hold on him
[54:56] to them gave he power to become the sons
[55:00] of god even to them that believe on his
[55:04] name and if you have been given a
[55:06] spiritual fortitude or the ability to
[55:09] reach out and to grab ahold of the
[55:11] revelation of this hour you have to say
[55:14] like john said that a man cannot receive
[55:16] these things except it comes from heaven
[55:20] jesus said that no man cometh unto the
[55:22] father unto me except the father draws
[55:25] him it's god that is doing this and and
[55:28] jesus said that i come in my father's
[55:30] name and ye
[55:33] me not you received me not you didn't
[55:36] take me and to think that here was the
[55:38] person or the author of life that was
[55:41] standing before the church of the day
[55:43] but yet where he was standing in in his
[55:46] full stature standing in his godhead
[55:49] standing there as the righteous one but
[55:52] yet they would not take of him who was
[55:56] the author of life and he said how can
[55:58] you believe which receive honor how can
[56:00] you receive honor one of honor and
[56:02] another and seek not the honor that
[56:04] cometh from god only so here we look
[56:07] that god has if you've been able to look
[56:10] into these things if you've been able to
[56:13] look in and to see who he is you're a
[56:15] blessed people this morning
[56:18] can you identify that you're a blessed
[56:19] people this morning
[56:24] you see there there's many there's been
[56:26] many churches many ages there's been
[56:28] many a people that have desired to look
[56:30] upon these things but only the elect and
[56:34] the chosen of god are anointed or
[56:36] anointed to receive this word that will
[56:40] take them out of this layout of cnh and
[56:43] we realize when the prophet would preach
[56:45] the anointed ones of the end time that
[56:48] there he was laying out that there was
[56:51] going to be false christs not false
[56:53] jesus's but there would be false
[56:55] anointed ones that would rise up in this
[56:58] hour and the bible said that it would be
[57:00] so close that it would deceive the very
[57:03] elect if it was possible
[57:06] oh aren't you glad this morning that it
[57:08] ain't impossible to deceive the very
[57:10] elect of god but yet you look in there
[57:13] and you'll find that that there are men
[57:15] just like you built like you women and
[57:18] women and men that serve god and love
[57:21] god but yet they're anointed and you
[57:23] watch that that brother branham would go
[57:25] in there and he would pull out that
[57:27] there are anointed ones there he said he
[57:29] said you look at that vulture he said
[57:32] it's anointed to fly also just like that
[57:35] eagle is anointed to fly but that eagle
[57:38] is built to go up there and that vulture
[57:41] can follow it so here it is in the
[57:44] natural that there only a heavenly bird
[57:47] can go up there
[57:49] only a heavenly bird can reach onto this
[57:52] level that you're called unto and i want
[57:54] this word to be to you today that you
[57:57] are anointed by the holy ghost to go
[58:00] where nobody else can go when you look
[58:03] over in matthew chapter 25 and you see
[58:05] there's ten virgins there but you're not
[58:08] a part of the fullest virgin because the
[58:10] holy ghost is what makes the difference
[58:13] between the wise and the fullest you see
[58:16] what made them wise was the oil which
[58:19] represents the holy ghost and you see
[58:21] when midnight came there went out a cry
[58:24] that the bridegroom coming and when the
[58:26] fullest looked out and they realized
[58:28] they didn't have no lamp in their oil
[58:30] they said give us some of that so that
[58:32] we might have it for ourself and they
[58:34] said go and buy from those that sell it
[58:37] but they were too late for the time had
[58:39] passed by their way but you were
[58:42] ordained and anointed before the
[58:44] foundation of the world to receive this
[58:47] baptism of the holy ghost i'm not just
[58:49] talking about a restoration of the gifts
[58:51] or an anointing that comes on your flesh
[58:54] but an anointing that'll take you out of
[58:56] this world an anointing that'll make you
[58:58] live right an anointing will make you
[59:00] that'll make you amen every single words
[59:03] of the word of god this word will put
[59:06] you where god has destined you to be
[59:10] many's desire to look on it but blessed
[59:12] are your eyes
[59:13] [Applause]
[59:15] but blessed are your eyes for you see
[59:17] many have heard this word but they
[59:19] rejected it but don't you look at david
[59:22] as the rejected king he's still anointed
[59:25] this morning
[59:26] there's a lot of people that reject the
[59:28] king of kings but i want you to know
[59:30] even though you can reject david he's
[59:33] still the anointed king that'll come out
[59:35] and he will whip the goliath
[59:39] hallelujah the anointing of the holy
[59:42] ghost that was poured upon david by the
[59:45] prophet samuel when he took that
[59:47] anointing all he poured it all on him
[59:52] just like when you get baptized we don't
[59:54] sprinkle you
[59:56] but we bury you in the name of the lord
[59:58] jesus christ in whom there is remission
[1:00:00] of sins and when the high priest would
[1:00:03] walk into the hole as a holiest they
[1:00:05] poured all of the anointing oil upon him
[1:00:11] which is a type of being baptized with
[1:00:13] the holy ghost and when god decides to
[1:00:16] give you the holy ghost he don't halfway
[1:00:18] give it to you
[1:00:20] he don't just give it to you so you can
[1:00:22] live light on right on the weekend but
[1:00:24] he gives it to you so that you can walk
[1:00:26] through laodicea unharmed untouched
[1:00:29] living and overcoming life filled with
[1:00:31] the baptism of the holy ghost where men
[1:00:33] can't walk but you're walking there
[1:00:35] because you're anointed for the hour
[1:00:43] there's been churches churches bride's
[1:00:45] brides but there's got to come one
[1:00:47] hallelujah there's got to come a real
[1:00:49] bribe there must come one that's not
[1:00:51] only got the mechanics but the dynamics
[1:00:54] of it that makes the church live
[1:00:56] more in the power
[1:00:58] of his resurrection you see before the
[1:01:01] foundation of the world you were seen
[1:01:04] with him and when you look over in
[1:01:06] revelations chapter 5 and 5 and you'll
[1:01:09] see that the elders spoke unto john when
[1:01:12] john was weeping because there was no
[1:01:15] one found in heaven and no one found an
[1:01:17] earth that was worthy but there came a
[1:01:19] voice and said we not behold the lion of
[1:01:23] the tribe of judah the root of david
[1:01:25] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[1:01:28] loose the seven seals thereof
[1:01:31] don't weep little bride
[1:01:34] he's not going to leave you down here
[1:01:36] unforsaken he's not going to leave you
[1:01:38] down here in this chaos of life don't
[1:01:41] weep little bride the lion of the tribe
[1:01:44] of judah has prevailed he has overcome
[1:01:48] death has been stricken away
[1:01:51] he prevailed over death
[1:01:53] and when you look over there in
[1:01:54] revelations chapter 5 you're not seeing
[1:01:57] you're not seeing a dead lamb
[1:02:00] you're seeing a bloody lamb that had
[1:02:02] been in battle one that had been
[1:02:04] fighting for you that had been paying
[1:02:06] the price for your sin one that had been
[1:02:09] wounded in the battle but i want to
[1:02:10] remind you that lamb was not dead
[1:02:14] in revelations 21 and 18 he said behold
[1:02:18] i am he that was dead
[1:02:20] and i am alive forevermore
[1:02:24] hallelujah he wasn't dead but he was
[1:02:26] very much alive and he stood up to take
[1:02:29] all of the redemption rights which had
[1:02:31] your name on it and i want to say this
[1:02:34] to the church of the living god he's
[1:02:36] still fighting your battles the blood's
[1:02:38] still on the throne and he says i'm
[1:02:40] worthy i'm worthy for ron spencer i'm
[1:02:43] worthy for harold shiftly i'm worthy for
[1:02:46] jim babb i'm worthy for randy hinkle i'm
[1:02:49] worthy for the pruitt family i'm worthy
[1:02:52] for any cause i am the lamb i'm strong
[1:02:56] enough to finish all of redemption's
[1:02:59] plans
[1:03:01] i am the one
[1:03:02] the maker of heaven and earth i am alpha
[1:03:05] i am omega
[1:03:08] i am he that was which is and which is
[1:03:11] to come
[1:03:12] and he is the one that redeemed us back
[1:03:17] where'd you come from in the beginning
[1:03:20] hallelujah i was with god
[1:03:23] in the beginning i was in his mind we
[1:03:24] don't believe in the pre-existing of
[1:03:26] souls but we believe that we were with
[1:03:28] him
[1:03:29] before the foundation of the world and
[1:03:31] he redeemed us back and he took the
[1:03:34] title deed of redemption and redemption
[1:03:37] of all of that legal's possession to all
[1:03:40] the lost means that everything that adam
[1:03:42] and eve lost you have
[1:03:45] what that ought to do to a born again
[1:03:47] son and daughter of god to realize this
[1:03:50] morning that everything that adam lost
[1:03:53] you hold in your possession this morning
[1:03:57] its legal possession to the abstract
[1:03:59] title deed of eternal life means that
[1:04:01] you possess everything
[1:04:04] everything that adam and eve lost
[1:04:06] the possession of that deed when adam
[1:04:08] could not meet the requirements of a
[1:04:10] redemption after he'd found that he lost
[1:04:12] it and he'd sinned and he separated
[1:04:14] himself from god and was on this side of
[1:04:17] the chasm so he could not redeem it he
[1:04:19] could he just couldn't do it because he
[1:04:22] he needed redemption himself so he could
[1:04:24] not do it
[1:04:27] you know
[1:04:28] on the other side of 1963 brother
[1:04:30] branham said that there was a gap there
[1:04:32] there there was a there was a chasm
[1:04:34] there but i want you to know on the
[1:04:36] other side of 1963
[1:04:38] he said he said they that the blood
[1:04:40] removed that gap
[1:04:42] it removed that chasm that separation
[1:04:45] the blood of jesus christ made a way
[1:04:48] we're not probing this morning we're not
[1:04:50] presuming this morning we're not
[1:04:52] guessing this morning we know what we
[1:04:54] have in our hand we know who we are we
[1:04:57] know what we've been born to do moses
[1:05:00] what's in your hand it's not just some
[1:05:02] ordinary rod that you're holding in your
[1:05:04] hand cast it down moses and moses got
[1:05:07] scared and walked away from it but the
[1:05:09] voice of the lord said pick it up by the
[1:05:11] tail and when he took it up by the tail
[1:05:14] it became a rod again
[1:05:16] just like when jesus was there on the
[1:05:18] cross he grabbed a hold of the serpent
[1:05:20] he took it and it was a sign that sin
[1:05:23] had been judged once and for all little
[1:05:26] bride of jesus christ what is in your
[1:05:29] hand
[1:05:31] it's the most powerful weapon that's
[1:05:33] ever been placed in the hand of humanity
[1:05:36] it is the word of almighty god and when
[1:05:39] you take a hold of this word it'll shut
[1:05:41] down all of pharaoh's magic
[1:05:44] [Music]
[1:05:45] your your rod will swallow pharaoh's rod
[1:05:50] i want you to know in your hand is not
[1:05:52] just some weak sword it's the king's
[1:05:55] sword not a king but the king
[1:05:59] you watch when you take out take a hold
[1:06:01] of that shield and take a hold of that
[1:06:03] sword well with faith you watch what'll
[1:06:06] take place
[1:06:07] as a son and daughter of god you can cut
[1:06:09] cancer loose
[1:06:11] as a son and daughter of god you got
[1:06:13] every right to move the complexes of
[1:06:15] life off of you as a son and daughter of
[1:06:17] god you've got every ability to speak to
[1:06:21] the mountain in your life and say
[1:06:22] mountain be moved
[1:06:27] hallelujah now satan's got a right to
[1:06:30] tell you that you're a liar satan's got
[1:06:32] a right to tell you you're not worthy
[1:06:33] he's got a right to tell you that you'll
[1:06:35] never get well he's got a right but the
[1:06:37] lamb's got a right this morning
[1:06:40] he's got a right to tell you that you
[1:06:42] were his before the foundation of the
[1:06:44] world he's got a right to say i healed
[1:06:46] you 2 000 years ago he's got a right to
[1:06:49] say i know you're going to make it
[1:06:51] through it
[1:06:58] hallelujah what the first adam lost the
[1:07:01] second adam came and gave back to you
[1:07:06] look at your neighbor and say i got it
[1:07:09] you're anointed to handle this
[1:07:13] you're anointed for it
[1:07:17] anybody can quote this scripture
[1:07:19] anybody can take it but the anointing is
[1:07:21] what makes the difference
[1:07:24] there's been a lot of people that were
[1:07:25] that were bogus dollars that come in and
[1:07:28] tried to do the same thing that you're
[1:07:29] doing but because there was no oil there
[1:07:33] they couldn't live it
[1:07:34] they couldn't make it manifest but
[1:07:36] there's a seed that's laying there
[1:07:39] there's a seed that's laying there with
[1:07:41] a promise hanging over top of it that
[1:07:43] it's going to be made manifest just like
[1:07:45] when when the disciples were up there on
[1:07:48] the day of pentecost and god had jesus
[1:07:50] had told them 10 days before go up there
[1:07:53] in jerusalem and wait for the promise of
[1:07:56] power to come upon you now they had that
[1:07:59] seed they had that promise in seed form
[1:08:03] but what were they doing up there they
[1:08:05] were up there thinking and praising god
[1:08:07] for it all the time before they ever got
[1:08:10] it
[1:08:12] before they ever got it they were
[1:08:13] thanking god for the holy ghost
[1:08:16] let me bring it down to your level
[1:08:17] before they seen healing they were
[1:08:19] thanking him for it before they seen the
[1:08:21] signs of the rapture they were thanking
[1:08:23] him for it are you with me before you
[1:08:25] seen your loved one walked through the
[1:08:27] door you were thanking them for it they
[1:08:29] had it in seed form
[1:08:32] but when the manifestation came it was
[1:08:35] no longer a seed it was an oak tree it
[1:08:38] was the holy ghost
[1:08:40] [Applause]
[1:08:42] they didn't have to say well jesus said
[1:08:44] this and jesus said that they could
[1:08:46] stand there and speak over the man at
[1:08:48] the beautiful gate and said thus saith
[1:08:50] the lord take up thy bed and walk
[1:08:55] he had a lot of people walk past his way
[1:08:57] but there's come by somebody
[1:09:00] there comes somebody that was anointed
[1:09:02] to do so there was a preacher come by my
[1:09:04] way one time and he laid his hands on me
[1:09:07] it wasn't his hands but it was the
[1:09:09] anointing of the word that they shall
[1:09:12] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:09:14] recover
[1:09:15] [Applause]
[1:09:16] they shall take up serpents they shall
[1:09:18] drink in a deadly thing and it shall not
[1:09:20] harm there because of the anointing of
[1:09:23] it
[1:09:29] in the invisible union
[1:09:31] he said we
[1:09:33] we know that the modern church in its
[1:09:35] present condition
[1:09:36] and its present state is in no condition
[1:09:38] to finish
[1:09:39] to finish up the great commission that
[1:09:41] god gave the church for this day
[1:09:45] he said now we know that the church
[1:09:46] could not the pentecostal church by no
[1:09:48] means by no means could carry out the
[1:09:51] last day message in its present
[1:09:53] condition it's going to be an elected
[1:09:56] people that's elected for it
[1:09:58] and here we are
[1:10:01] here we are
[1:10:03] if you identify yourself right there go
[1:10:04] ahead and raise your hand and here we
[1:10:06] are
[1:10:07] and we're standing here not with a
[1:10:09] closed book but we're standing here with
[1:10:11] an open book with a clear title deed to
[1:10:13] the redemption to all of redemption it's
[1:10:16] standing in your hand and when when you
[1:10:19] look at this when you look at this in
[1:10:21] the light of the revelation of the word
[1:10:23] of the hour and you realize that you're
[1:10:25] not standing there with a closed book
[1:10:27] but you're standing there with an open
[1:10:29] book to every promise
[1:10:32] all the benefits all the blessings it
[1:10:35] comes to you in a whole new life and you
[1:10:37] can say like paul said what shall we say
[1:10:39] to these things if god before us then
[1:10:42] who can be against us hear of god little
[1:10:44] children and have overcame him because
[1:10:46] greater is he that is in you you can't
[1:10:48] read you can read that with a closed
[1:10:50] book but it don't mean as much to you
[1:10:52] but with an open book you know who you
[1:10:55] are
[1:10:55] [Applause]
[1:10:57] and ain't a devil in hell can stop a
[1:10:59] child of god when they know where
[1:11:01] they're standing at
[1:11:05] in the light of that revelation you can
[1:11:07] say no weapon that's formed against me
[1:11:10] shall prosper in the light of that
[1:11:12] revelation you can look at it and you
[1:11:15] can see healing you can see redemption
[1:11:17] you can see salvation
[1:11:19] [Applause]
[1:11:25] lord give me strength
[1:11:26] it ain't a closed book
[1:11:30] all the loose ends have been tied back
[1:11:33] together and all the denominational
[1:11:35] barriers that had held the word of god
[1:11:38] bound that had held the holy spirit
[1:11:40] bound to the river euphrates was broke
[1:11:42] off of it and all the powers of the
[1:11:44] theological men of the day that were
[1:11:47] against the word and against the move of
[1:11:49] god
[1:11:51] have been struck off
[1:11:56] what are you saying brother angel you're
[1:11:57] free to worship him this morning you're
[1:12:00] free to serve him this morning in spirit
[1:12:02] and in truth what am i saying to you you
[1:12:05] can take this book and you can overcome
[1:12:08] all of laodicea not just part of it but
[1:12:11] every single bit of it it has been
[1:12:13] struck off
[1:12:14] by the lamb
[1:12:21] hallelujah
[1:12:24] looking through those eyeglasses looking
[1:12:27] through those eyeglasses you can see
[1:12:29] that you're a part of the vision looking
[1:12:32] through those eyeglasses you can look
[1:12:34] over there and say that we in our
[1:12:35] offspring will be there with us looking
[1:12:38] through those eyeglasses we could say
[1:12:39] we're more than able to overcome this
[1:12:42] thing there's a lot of people that want
[1:12:43] to rise up and say we're not going to
[1:12:45] have it they want to try to deny the
[1:12:47] move of god and shut down the holy ghost
[1:12:50] and shut it down for young people but
[1:12:52] there's a lamb that's standing up
[1:12:57] hallelujah the lamb didn't just open up
[1:12:58] the seals so that you could become
[1:13:00] another group or another church where
[1:13:02] you can tack on your name the message of
[1:13:04] the hour he didn't do that he'd come to
[1:13:07] reveal to you the unwritten word to give
[1:13:10] your rapture in faith to set your soul
[1:13:12] fly and realize that you are the people
[1:13:16] of revelations 10 that go and take the
[1:13:19] book

[1:13:42] express himself in the fullness of his

[1:15:49] baptist they'll put you in your place
[1:15:51] they know the scripture like the back of
[1:15:53] their head but there's no anointing
[1:15:56] but you could take a little housewife
[1:15:58] that's sitting here you could take a
[1:16:00] little housewife and stack them up
[1:16:01] against the biggest theologians in this
[1:16:03] day that ain't got to answer power you
[1:16:05] can take that little housewife maybe
[1:16:07] that little grandma and you can stack
[1:16:09] her up right there beside her because of

[1:16:13] can shut down the mouths of theologians

[1:23:09] out of that land to go into the land
[1:23:12] that you that he was destined to be in
[1:23:14] and god told him that and god's telling
[1:23:16] you that
[1:23:18] you've got to separate yourself from
[1:23:20] your father and your mother you've got
[1:23:23] to separate yourself you know brother
[1:23:25] branham said that abraham's father was
[1:23:27] nothing but a fi but i but i fly in his
[1:23:30] soup and a hair and a biscuit all of his
[1:23:32] life and he had to separate from that
[1:23:34] thing there's people that'll bring you
[1:23:36] down and shut you down and try to tell
[1:23:38] you that that's for days gone by you've
[1:23:40] got to separate yourself
[1:23:42] and be like abraham and far
[1:23:45] follow the one that's leading you and
[1:23:47] speaking to you where abraham was
[1:23:49] walking into a land of the unseen
[1:23:52] he never seen it before but yet it's out
[1:23:55] in front of him he was seeking a builder
[1:23:57] he was seeking a kingdom whose builder
[1:24:00] and maker was god
[1:24:04] and then over in genesis chapter 22 a
[1:24:06] few a few chapters later
[1:24:08] after abraham had laid isaac down he
[1:24:11] laid everything down
[1:24:12] all of the promise that had been put out
[1:24:14] before him you got to be willing to put
[1:24:17] everything even though it just gave it
[1:24:18] to you
[1:24:20] that you waited for it all your life you
[1:24:21] got to be willing to lay it down
[1:24:24] before you can really be a blessing you
[1:24:26] got to lay everything down
[1:24:28] you can learn that the hard way or you
[1:24:30] can go the easy way you gotta learn to
[1:24:32] lay everything down
[1:24:36] my life is in his hands
[1:24:38] but after abraham had laid isaac down
[1:24:42] here god declares himself as jehovah
[1:24:46] jireh
[1:24:48] that hear the god who sees and the god
[1:24:50] that provides saying that in verse 17
[1:24:53] that in blessing i will bless thee and
[1:24:56] in multiplying i will multiply thy seed
[1:24:59] as the stars of the heaven and as the
[1:25:01] sand which is upon the seashore and my
[1:25:04] seed shall possess the gate of his
[1:25:07] enemies and paul said that if you are
[1:25:10] children of god by by faith in christ
[1:25:12] jesus and galatians 3 that as many as
[1:25:15] you have been baptized into christ have
[1:25:18] put on christ there is neither jew nor
[1:25:21] greek there's neither bond nor free
[1:25:23] there's neither male nor female for you
[1:25:25] are all one in christ jesus
[1:25:29] and if you be christ verse 29 then are
[1:25:32] you abraham's seed
[1:25:34] and heirs according to the promise
[1:25:42] i'll just let that sink in just for a
[1:25:44] moment
[1:25:46] i am
[1:25:47] an heir
[1:25:48] with god
[1:25:50] i am a joint heir with all of heaven
[1:25:54] and jesus said that all power in heaven
[1:25:57] and in earth is given unto me and as god
[1:26:01] had spoken to abraham that thy seed
[1:26:04] shall possess the gate of his enemy and
[1:26:08] i want you to know that samson when he
[1:26:10] looked at that scripture he looked at it
[1:26:12] as more than just a literal scripture
[1:26:14] but he took it as himself being
[1:26:17] circumcised being raised up to destroy
[1:26:19] the philistines he went up there when he
[1:26:22] went up there with that woman and they
[1:26:23] had him all walled in and the
[1:26:25] philistines had had they had got him and
[1:26:27] they gave us him completely around and
[1:26:29] they said we got him all fenced in and
[1:26:32] sampson rolled back his shoulders and he
[1:26:34] looked back and he seen those seven
[1:26:36] locks on his head and he said hey i'm
[1:26:39] circumcised and i've got the anointing
[1:26:41] covenant upon me and he didn't cry and
[1:26:43] say what am i gonna do now but he
[1:26:45] literally walked up there to the
[1:26:47] strongest part of that city and grabbed
[1:26:50] a hold of the gates of gaza and took him
[1:26:52] all the way up tons of weight upon him
[1:26:55] because he read that scripture that thy
[1:26:57] seed shall possess the gate of his enemy
[1:27:02] he didn't cry about it he didn't get
[1:27:04] shook up about it but he just simply
[1:27:06] rode right under the anointing
[1:27:12] he rode right underneath that anointing
[1:27:14] that anointing came he didn't just
[1:27:16] anoint him but anointed a jawbone
[1:27:22] he'll take what you got
[1:27:23] and he'll make it blessed
[1:27:25] he'll take what you got and he'll make
[1:27:27] it sure he'll take what you got and
[1:27:29] he'll make you come out the way he
[1:27:31] destined it to come out ain't no need of
[1:27:33] you rolling back and getting scared and
[1:27:35] running for cover
[1:27:36] samson all he did he knew that that
[1:27:39] anointed gift of power could destroy any
[1:27:42] philistine that would ever stand before
[1:27:44] him
[1:27:50] any philistine that would ever stand
[1:27:52] before him
[1:27:54] he took that anointing and he destroyed
[1:27:57] it
[1:27:58] it's not an if you shall possess but it
[1:28:01] is you will possess the gate of the
[1:28:04] enemy and you will take rightful
[1:28:06] ownership over that enemy's gates and
[1:28:08] you'll do with them as you please
[1:28:13] what gate's been stacked up against you
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:19] have church this morning what gate's
[1:28:20] been stacked up against you
[1:28:22] walk out there and take the enemy's
[1:28:24] gates

[1:28:30] morning lays the power to heal all
[1:28:32] sickness in the church of the living god

[1:29:01] the hell's demons all of its cancers all
[1:29:03] the powers of darkness will not be able
[1:29:06] to overcome you but you will overcome it

[1:29:23] country
[1:29:24] than them that which are sent out to

[1:29:30] send out the best if you're coming out
[1:29:32] up against russia you send out the best
[1:29:34] and when god was coming up against
[1:29:36] laodicea he sent out the bride that's a
[1:29:39] final voice to the final age that's more
[1:29:41] than able to do exceedingly abundantly
[1:29:44] above all that you could ever ask or
[1:29:46] think according to the power that

[1:34:25] he's what is he i mean was he five six
[1:34:28] years old walks over there and takes my
[1:34:29] mama's keys we didn't see who did it
[1:34:32] but the teacher when mom started looking
[1:34:34] for him she started she started looking
[1:34:36] around and started asking

[1:34:43] know who's got him
[1:34:45] he's the guy with different views he's
