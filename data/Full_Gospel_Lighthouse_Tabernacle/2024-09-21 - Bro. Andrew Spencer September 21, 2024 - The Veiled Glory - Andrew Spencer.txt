have been sung and your presence has been failed and Lord we get ready to take upon this thought that you've placed on our hearts Lord in our minds Lord and I pray that the Holy Spirit would just begin to kind of whip through this place and begin to minister To Us by the preaching of the word father we've had a a week full of events Lord we've had we've had a week where we've we've went through some things we've went through went through weddings we've went through just different parts of our life but Lord now we're here back and this is the greatest part of a Christian's life is to hear the preaching of the word it's not the man but it's the god that is behind the man the voice behind the voice and we pray that heaven would speak tonight Lord I pray that you would move aside both hearer and speaker here tonight and that heaven would Proclaim that you are still alive father we yield our vessels to you everything thing that is that will be done and said in this building here tonight we ask that you would have thine own way for the glory of God's sake we pray that you would Minister to those that are lost I pray that you would bind up the Brokenhearted Lord I know that there's many different situations that are here that many unspoken requests that you need to move on so father we invite you father Lord into this building just now to take complete control of every situation and every spirit that would hinder the children of God from moving into the promises so God we yield our vessels to you and ask father for the furtherance of thy kingdom that the preaching of the word would be sent to this place that is destined to and we'll yield our vessels to you father and give you glory honor and praise for all that is due unto your name and the Bride of Jesus Christ said am amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 3 [Music] verse 13 and also down to uh uh also Hebrews 12: 22 just want to remind everyone uh tomorrow after service we'll be having a baptism here for our brother Dylan shifflet and and so we want to be remembering him because God gave us a promise that if you repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remissions of your sins that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now now we know that that we are to do our part and then God will do his part and I believe with all of my heart that brother Dylan's on a is on on the right path and I'm I'm very proud of him some of the conversations that I've had with him I just be honest with you they're they're quite profound and I'm very I'm very um very moved at how the holy spirit is dealing so it but that that is this is an open invitation if anybody else would like to be baptized and you're here hearing this you just bring your clothes and towels and things with you tomorrow amen let's just go to the word here tonight 2 Corinthians chapter 3 in verse 13 and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look at look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same veil untaken in the reading of the Old Testament which veil was done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord notice what he what Paul was talking about when the heart is turned to the Lord we know what the message of Malachi 4 is to do it's to turn the hearts when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord Hebrews 12 and verse 22 but you are come unto Mount Zion and under the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and into an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of the sprinkling and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifying the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore re we receiving a kingom om Paul speaking to the bride of Christ we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire also Hebrews chapter 6 verse 19 we'll just we'll just throw it up on the screen for you which hope we have as an anchor of the soul but sure and steadfast which entereth into that within the Veil may God bless his word you may be seated tonight here in the presence of the Lord I'd like to speak to you by these by these text here tonight uh on a little thought on the veiled Glory the veiled glory and we realize that we are living in a very shaking time but we have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken and that kingdom is that of the Holy Ghost and we realize that that that which has been released here that we realize that it is the deity of almighty God that he is releasing to the body of Jesus Christ and it is not something that is that is a fairy tale it's not something that is fictional or or non-fictional it's not something that that you read about and it's not true it's something that is a living reality and we have seen we have seen God with our own eyes and we have seen what God is doing right here amongst us and it's not something that you have to sit back and wonder at but you realize that the message of the hour came to give you eyesight so that you could see by prophetic vision and pro by prophetic word that you can literally Pierce into the word of God that men have studied for years and years and thousands of years and they've not been able to understand it but because of the Optics that you have been given and the ability to be able to look at that you're able to glare or look into the word of God and see the very Glory of almighty God because when William brandom would come here he was a man that was not of Education he was not a man that was full of wisdom but he was a man that was led by the revelation of the Holy Spirit and brother Brandon would preach preach a preach a sermon before the seals and after the seals of God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same and I think it's amazing that that that brother Brandon would preach that before the seals and he would preach that after the seals and so many people had sat there and wondered and pondered about the Book of Revelations and there are men that theologians that don't even dare touch the word that that book of Revelation because they don't know what to do with it but here a prophet begin to preach and begin to bring out and reveal and make known those things that had been hidden down there for years after years and on the on the front of it and on the back of it he simply says he said God is revealing himself in Simplicity it's so simple that he could take a hillbilly KY and and he could bring forth the word of God and he would release it to a people that would have a understanding as a Son of God and not as a servant of God but they would have the eyesight as a Son of God and it has been said that that the best place in the world to hide something is right in front of it's right in plain view if you want to hide anything you just hide it right there and I think it's one of the greatest attributes about a Christian is that they have the ability to be able to look to be able to look at things as people that are walking by and they see things that the rest of the world see things on the surface but the body of Jesus Christ because of who she is and because of the Revelation that she's under that she can stand there and by the attributes of almighty God that she can see God displaying himself in every form that he would set there because God has given us an anointing in this hour because we realize that in this hour that there's Darkness there's nakedness there's cold and formal Church entity but God has anointed a people with an eyesight to an to an Isa to anoint their eyes so that they could see and God has released something to the body of Jesus Christ so that she would have an understanding that could thwart the enemy when she when the enemy would come up against her she is Anointed with an isaf that she can Pierce through the coldness of Le oosa that she can stand there in the face of all the all the things of Satan and she could stand there by the revealing of the word of God now brother Brandon when he would Pierce into the church ages book brother Brandon would lace it in there in the revelation of Jesus Christ on how important that Revelation is to the believer and he he would said now that Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling and he said this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculptor unveiling his work of Statuary and exposing it to the onlooker he said it is an uncovering that a revelation is an uncovering revealing that which was previously hidden he said now the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of Christ because many of people have been have the ability to be able to look back and see Jesus of 2,000 years ago there's a lot of people that have have great knowledge of the word of what Paul said in those things but this Revelation is not just of Jesus of the person of Christ but it is the revelation of his Future Works in the uncoming seven Church ages and too many times people have the ability to they they have the ability to pierce in through the world uh as as brother brenon would say it like this he said he said man he said is he has they have the ability to get to the moon he said but they walk over a blade of grass and they miss God underneath where their feet you see there's a lot of people that can look past things they can look in the past and they can look in the future and see Jesus but where we want to see Jesus is Jesus right here and Jesus right now I want to find out where God is hiding himself at because I don't want to just look back to what Paul said and I don't want to just look back there and see what Moses saw I want to see what God wants me to see in the hour that we're living in and the veil is where God is hiding himself and and the prophet would say in the Hebrew series he said the veil he said and the veil was who Jesus because Jesus said it's not me that doeth the works but my father said my father that dwelleth in me the work he doeth The Works the father worketh and I worketh hither too here he is as the veiled one Walking In the Flesh God Emmanuel God With Us God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself here he is walking around here he is walking around now he came down and made a San a sanctification or a provision or a propitiation that through his death offered and paid the price of sin that he might come back and dwell in us that then then the faith that we have is a veiled Faith or a veiled person then the faith that we have is a veiled Faith or a veiled person therefore we don't look at the things that we see in this Veil this Veil right here we don't look at the things that we see in this Veil but we look at the things but the veil he said we don't look at the things that we see in this Veil he said the ve this veil has education and it does things and it speaks things he said it's a scientific thing he said but the spirit of the Living God that dwells in here cause those things which were not as though they were if God said so there is your veiling we are in that Veil we're in that Veil you know I know that the veil this Veil right here has a lot of disappointments this veil has sickness this veil has mistakes this veil has torment but this Veil also hides the power of almighty God you can look at William brandom and William Bram always hated being short he hated being less of a man than some people you remember when he would standing there and that that man that cowboy came in there and he sneezed so loud that it shook the whole room he said that's a real man right there William brandham as the as the as the man looked at things and wished he was taller wished he was this way but notice where did them squirrels come from how did them storms get spoke out of existence it was because there was a power that was behind the veil it was beholding the glory of almighty God that many can't see but behind that veil was the glory and the power Hallelujah how many get disappointed at their Veil how many get disappointed that you get sick and you constantly go back through it and you have you have the constant cycles that you got to break through and press through but in that Veil is there is a power that is going to break the Cycles in life in that Veil is the power that has has the ability to accept God's healing power over your life in that Veil Hallelujah in that Veil is where God is going to display his attributes of of miraculous healings and and determination and demonstration and the power of the Holy Ghost is right out of the veil that you're so disappointed in but I love what the scripture says in 1 John 2 and 20 but you have an unction that you have an anointing from the Holy One and you know all things that Jesus that Jesus would even say except you believe that I am he you will die in your sins so if you can't believe that I am he you are absolutely lost so he is saying he said I am a revelation if you can't understand that who I am is deity in flesh then you're lost you see because he had to be more than a man he had to be more than a prophet he had to be more than just the theologians he had to be God it took a revelation to be able to see that this was almighty God Elohim dwelling in flesh prophets were the flesh that God would dwell in and men would recognize men would recognize that that was more than just a ordinary man that was made out of the same elements that that human beings were made out of because they recognized that when a prophet was speaking that a man's words won't act like that when Elijah would prophesy and Isaiah would prophesy and and job would prophesy they recognize that that was more than just a man but that man words had the power behind it that of a prophet Messenger to be able to speak things because Moses could stand there and and and Daniel could stay stand there and they could preach and they could prophesy and they could pray and Supernatural events would take place it was a sign that God was veiling himself because man's words won't act that way but it was the mind of almighty God that Jesus was going to hide himself he was going to hide himself self in a veil of humanity that's where God wanted to dwell in he could have chose anything to preach the message he could have chos the Stars to preach the message but what he wanted was Humanity to preach the message and Satan has tried his very best ever since the Garden of Eden to stop that Veil notice what William Brandon would say when he coming down to the closing hours of 1965 he said it was a lust Veil that FL that fell over Adam and Eve eyes so they were looking through that eyes they were looking through that Veil but you have a different Veil you have a holy Veil that is over your eyes you can't see what the world sees you can't understand like the world understands but you have been given a holy Veil to look through and see the mind of Christ and ever since the Garden of Eden Satan has tried to stop this Veil he has tried to stop Adam he tried to stop Abraham he tried to stop Isaac and Jacob and Joseph and Moses and David and Daniel and he tried to stop the veil and many of times he did stop the veil but he could not stop the glory that was behind the veil David failed but the glory didn't fall Moses had a temper but the glory didn't fall Daniel had weaknesses job had failures but the glory that was in The Veil The Glory that was in the veil could not fail ah do you hear me Satan you can stop the veil but you'll never stop the glory come on somebody you can shut up tapes you can shut up microphones but you'll never stop the glory I feel like preaching tonight and when Jesus came he was God in flesh and they knew that that man that God was with him even Nicodemus was a high ranking official in the church he knew he came to him in night time he came to him in secrecy and he began to talk to him and said look Master we know that no man can do the works that you're doing except God be with him you see you see he knew that there was something special there was something more than what he saw and what he read about in David and what he read about over in the book of Moses he knew there was something special that the very word that had been written that Moses would say that God is going to raise up a prophet La unto me here he was standing in the flesh but he couldn't understand how that power got on the inside of him even Jesus after he raises Lazarus from the grave he's standing there he's standing there in John chapter 12 and they're having a banquet and a feast and Lazarus is standing there and brother bandman said it in one way he said they came to that banquet not to see Jesus but they came there to see the witness they came there to see the witness of the power of Jesus Christ come on somebody you didn't show up here to see William brandham you showed up to see the power of William brandom's message come on somebody I don't need to see had Sons I don't need to see them Three Squirrels I don't see Nei I don't need to see a storm spoke out of Colorado I don't need to see that but what I need to see is the glory hidden in my vessel Hallelujah you could stop us you could stop and try to stop us with all of your might but you'll never stop the glory you could put Lazarus in the grave but the glory got him out of it Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord you can try to put it some some in some cre or some denomination and try to put us in a box that we're just another church but you can't have the glory what is it it's his glory veiled in your flesh and the Bible said and there were certain Greeks they came and said we would see Jesus where would I point him to today brother Doug I wouldn't Point him to some nail scarred hands I wouldn't Point him to some Cross I'd Point him to you I want to see Jesus I want to see his power and I love what what Jesus begin to teach them he said except a corn of wheat would fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die bringeth forth he was telling them I am who you're looking for but they couldn't understand that that was him they were looking at him they saw him but they couldn't see God I love what the Bible said in John 12:37 but though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believed not on him that the saying of Isaias the prophet might be fulfilled which he spake Lord who ha believed our report and to whom of the Lord and to whom hath the Lord that the arm of the Lord had been revealed therefore they could not believe because Isaiah said again he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart so they could not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted and I said heal them these things said Isaias when he saw his glory now how did Isaiah say them things and they were happening right there in John chapter 12 some 900 years later he was looking at the glory that neither fadeth away or goeth away every they were looking at him how are you doing these Miracles then they could not see God brother Chester they just saw a man they wondered how he got that power whence does a man have this kind of a power whence who who who has the ability to stop the Suns and stop the storms and and speak to the winds and they obey him how did he get this power they looked on it and said how did that power get on the inside of that vessel that's what Legion was looking at that's what Legion was looking at he seen a veil but there was something that was ordained on the inside of that man that had a name of Legion at that time he was ordained not to see the veil but to see God in a man Hallelujah they were predestinated to be blinded because a prophet saw it but you are predestinated to see it I'd have myself a shout right there I can't unsee this I can't unsee the mercies of God I can't unsee his power still the same I can't unse that he I can't unsee that God still gives the Holy Ghost I can't unsee that God still delivers from alcoholism and delivers from drugs and delivers from bondage I can't unse it because I'm predestinated to see it because there has been an invisible Union that has transpired in this generation and we're Justified as if we never done it in the first place I can't go back to water down God dogmas and Creeds and denominations I've been Justified I never did it in the first place come on somebody you was never in God's mind a Catholic or a presbyterian or a Methodist or a Baptist you was always a son of almighty God and God has veiled himself in that [Applause] Tabernacle he said God was failed in the form of a man and he hid himself from the view I love this he hid himself from their view they could only see a man but those predestinated to sing God now notice what he says here he said one saw a man and the other saw God he said it was God veiled in the human being making both of them right making both of them right but your faith in that what you do not not see you believe it anyhow they seen the same Veil Peter saw the same Veil The in Greek saw but Peter saw something more than the church World saw when this message came by my way I saw something different than the heads of the theologians saw I saw Jesus Christ I didn't see some man I didn't see some Creed I didn't see some idea I saw Jes Jesus he was in that flesh and that flesh was his Veil and the veil was rent that God might be made manifest the Roman power was trying to stop the veil but they could not stop the clo come on Church you look what Catholicism is doing today they are trying to stop the veil they're not just trying to work they're not just trying to work over there in Rome they are working through the umbilical cord of baptism and it's trying to stop the glory come on somebody Roman it don't you be scared of Communism don't you be scared of socialism don't you be scared of that you watch Roman ISM watch's that power trying to creep in there and give you a tradition instead of the word of God hallelujah but you are predestinated not to take the Seal of the mark of a beast but to take the Seal of the Holy Ghost it's like Solomon when he's standing there and he's hiding the very Glory of almighty God and news starts traveling that there's a man up there that God is anointing and [Music] using the veil was Solomon but the power was from God he had the knowledge and the wisdom to be able to decipher and tell and discern things he had the ability but that wasn't his ability that was God's ability in the veil of humanity and everybody that ever has a god-given gift it is not the man it was not William brandham come on somebody it's not Donnie Reagan it's not Tim Bru it's not Ron Spencer it's the glory Behind the Veil come on somebody I don't care who you are and what your name is if you're a son and daughter of God and you have the same Holy Ghost the same power you can be a little bitty old mother standing up there in a balcony and pray for a baby and God work his Works he is veiling himself Hallelujah what did she see what did this woman see I love what brother random said she was a heathen but she was ordained to see it brother brandom said it like this he said she was a heathen but she was ordained to life she hearded it others might have heard it and paid no attention to it oh nonsense is a bunch of holy rollers but she believed it there was something on the inside of her that said that sounds awful good oh Hallelujah maybe you turned on a tape and you heard good evening friends and he said oh that sounds awful good come on somebody he is veiling himself he veiled himself in Malachi 4 but where is that voice taking us in this day how'd you get here how'd you find your position how'd you get in this case how did you get here why do you believe like you believe how do you stand Toe to Toe to Satan after war after attack after after all these things stand there it's because you are hungry to see the almighty God revealed in your flesh because if you could have gave up you'd already gave up but because God put something on the inside of you he ordained you to life you don't even know how it got there but that power got there Brother David it was God's for knowledge that put that on the inside of you he saw you when you was at your worst but he's also saw you at your [Applause] best the Bible says in First Kings chapter 19 and verse 9 and he came thither into a cave and lodged there be behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou he Elijah and he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts for the Lord of Israel ha forsaken thy Covenant and thrown down thine altars and slain the prophets with a sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away and he said go forth and stand upon the mountain before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by in a great strong wind and rent the mountains and breaking es the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind and earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still Small Voice notice and it was so that when Elijah heard it what did he hear what did he hear he heard a voice that he wrapped his face in the mountain in the manle and went out and stood in the entering of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said said what doest thou here Elijah if you want to go down there and read the rest of that you're going to you're going to find where I'm getting ready to take you but I don't want to read no further but this quote that I'm getting ready to to to bring to your attention it's a quote that was from a collection of brother brandom's handwritten sermon notes which is on display in in William Brandon's Memorial Library there in Tucson Arizona and he titled this set of notes the glory of the Lord but brother brandham went on to be with the Lord before he could preach this message and I've got I've got the I've got a picture and the brother said it wouldn't it wouldn't show up there so if you want that picture I'll give it to you uh it was in one of them if you want to it was uh George Smith and them and uh sister Rebecca Smith they they put it out in them only believe only believe magazines you you remember some of you some of you remember them books notice here's what brother Ram had written down he said notice him Elijah in the cave he said the Oneness storm he said Billy Graham with Earth shaking campaigns he said R Robert the Pentecostal Russian wind notice go back to First Kings 19 he said notice the winds came by there and it did not attract his attention are you with me the Earth shaking campaigns came by the way and it never moved the prophets they were only effects of his p passing by he said but what attracted the Prophet Elijah come on somebody I want to know what attracted the Prophet Elijah he's in his prophetic office he is a prophetic voice to that generation he is a Ministry that God is going to use over five times throughout every single one of his ages but what attracted the Prophet Elijah how'd you get here it was the glory of his voice word he was revealing his glory plans he said the prophet waited on his office if Lord gives me if the Lord gives me opportunity I want to preach on this set of notes for a little bit he was revealing his glory plans he said the prophet waited on his office not as a type he said notice notice as a type not long then to the rapture he was only near in the wind the earthquake the fire Etc but the man of God waited for the manifested reality notice how he goes on the Vindicated word abiding Glory notice when the abiding Glory comes it's not long until the Rapture then Elijah was up there and he thought he was the only one he thought he was the only one that was going to go in but God be to reveal his glory pans to him and show him he wasn't the only one up there what did he do he said there's 7,000 more down there just like Elijah they believe the same message they worship the same God they have not bowed down to ba and the gods of leosia but there is a people that is predestinated they are going to believe you they are going to follow you there's a man down there that you're going to anoint and you're going to throw your man on over on him he's going to have a double portion ask for a double p double portion he's going to carry on your message and you're going to transfer your anointing over unto him come on somebody what did God give to us not Elijah's Spirit he gave us his Spirit come on somebody we are way past the days of Elijah's Manel and Elisha's Manel but what has been given to the Church of the Living God is the manle of the Holy Ghost What attracted Elijah to it it was the glory it was the voice the glory of his voice what brought you here but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished and I heard a voice saying unto me go and take the book I out of the hand of the voice I take that book out of the hand of the Angel he veiled his glory in his voice his voice caught the attention of the elect his voice he veiled his glory in the voice of the seventh angel but now he's revealing his glory plan now he's revealing his glory plans it wasn't just William bram's message it's your message it wasn't just a oneman message come on somebody but now it's a Min member bride is that right what is it now his glory plans are a bride's body veiled with his glory the same Glory that was in Elijah was in Elisha and the same power and the same spirit that was in Jesus is the same power and the same spirit that is now given unto you by measure by the Holy Ghost you remember when God God was up there on the mountain with Moses and he's revealing him the very secrets of his heart and he's he's up there he's up there and he's getting plans from almighty God how to build the Tabernacle and he's laying out his Commandments he's lining out all of his judgments he's lining out all of his Commandments and the word of the Lord spoke unto them that that if an animal or a man even touch the mountain where the glory of God was you had to thrust that animal through so that you cannot touch the anointed of the Lord the glory of the Lord can only be handled by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit knows where to drop his glory off that that's why he has seen you not going down in feet but going in Rapture I love what the prophet said he said if that was glorious he said but what about this Glory he said if that was veiled by a natural Veil he said and here we are veiled by a spiritual Veil Veil he said don't try to look at the natural he said but break into the spirit and see where you're at and what hour that we're living in I realize what hour that we're living in right now because I realize that we're on Saturday night and your Veil is wore out I understand that I understand you've had a hard week I understand that you've you've had many ups and downs and have a lot of mental battles you've you've had physical battles as well but do you realize that a prophet would say that it's it's it's your Veil it's a spiritual Veil and I love what the prophet says he said this Veil it's hiding God from you he said that's the thing that's keeping you from enjoying it all do you realize that your Veil right now your flesh is keeping you from enjoying your Victory your Veil right now is keeping you from enjoying the glory of the Lord you literally have the ability by the Holy Spirit dwelling on the inside of you to make your Veil obey your F oey obey your spirit this Veil I'm giving you Prophet words it's hiding God from you it's that thing that's keeping you from enjoying it all y you say well I I shout and I jump up and down he said every word he believed every word but one he said it's the full word of God the promise of this hour made manifest so if this Veil is keeping me from enjoying it all and God is greater than my flesh how much more can the Holy Spirit make my veil obey his word what makes you amen the word what makes you stand up to the preaching of the word what makes you obey it it's the V it's the glory within the veil Moses was a man like you and I he was a prophet but he was more than a prophet he was a prophet messenger that God was going to use his lips to speak mouth to mouth God would speak mouth to mouth to Moses and then God would speak through the lips of Moses right to the church notice what it says in Exodus 4:15 and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and I will be thy mouth and be with his mouth and will teach you what you shall do and he talking about Aaron shall be thy spokesman because Moses had come up with all of these excuses of why he couldn't do it brother Barham said that Moses was cured right there I don't see it brother Andrew because Moses was a man that was full of wisdom and knowledge down there in Egypt he had the abilities he had the mindset of it all but when he got up before the pillar of fire he had every excuse in the world brother brandham said he was cured right there he said and he shall be thy spokesman under the people and he shall be even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to him instead of God so Aaron was going to be Moses's prophet and Moses was going to become a word become a God by the word of God being placed in his mouth notice when he come down off of that mountain the people seen something that happened that God had veiled himself in his prophet so that they couldn't even look on him because the glory of the Lord was so great on Moses that Moses had to Avil himself because of the glory that was that was extr extruding from his life that God veiled himself in his Prophet to speak his words to them Moses was that Living Word to the people veiled by the pillar of fire I what do you get that brother answer brother randam said he was veiled by the pillar of fire in Moses he said which was later to be veiled in behind Badger skins if I'm want to hide something and hide it in plain view so if I literally want to hide the greatest gift of all humankind I'll hide it in sister Devon now who's going to imagine it's going to be in there let's get real who's going to imagine it's going to get on the inside of Dylan how how how how can he get in that guy by the name of Jordan Martin how how can he get in there now surely if God is speaking to Moses up there on that mountain and he's already had a word with him and told him you're going to come back to this mountain and you're going to worship me and now he's here and he comes down there said now you build me this Tabernacle and I'm going to live in that Tabernacle I'm going to dwell in that Tabernacle and on the top of that Tabernacle it's going to be the worst and the most ugliest animals that's going to hide who God all Mighty how could that power get on the ins side of an animal like you come on some have you ever studied out of Bater they're the meanest animals they will fight to the death they are they they're they're their rank in their flesh they're nasty creatures but this is going to be the skin that God wants to hide himself behind and some of you was low down some of you was murderers some of you was idolatrous but God was going to hide himself behind the greatest Veil they missed it they missed it in Jesus they missed it in William Branham and I dare say they missed it in you [Applause] how'd that power get in there how'd that power get on the inside of that boot liger son that would have been a murderer would have been a murder if God didn't stop that rifle he would have been a murderer he meant to kill them boys but God was not going to let the veil stop the glory come on somebody you was in drugs you was in alcohol but God was not going to let your Veil stop the glory so God changed the skins and put himself on the inside of [Applause] you there's his glory [Applause] plans hallelujah how to get in there how do you know it's in there how do you know it's different I was reading I sent it to my family today it's it's powerful read you got a reading about I forget her last name sister Rosella believe you met her one time Ro Rosella Griffith yeah and she came and she she had just got addicted to Wine got addicted to alcohol and all these things and and before long she was a fullblown alcoholic and she her mother didn't know what to do with her but she heard about a man that was coming to an arena and she heard she said that there were men that came to her there were men that came to her and tried to reason with her with the scriptures these were Rosella's words said but I needed somebody like the apostles that could lay their hands on me and cast the demon of alcoholism out of me she said and I went there and she said I got the car j27 the prayer car and when it come my time I stood there and William brandham called that thing out on me said I see you're an alcoholic and he cast that demon out of her and right there she was completely healed she walked off of that altar walked down them stairs and there was a woman there there said I feel so sorry for you she said you don't have to feel sorry for me no more I'm Healed you don't have to feel sorry for me you don't have to feel sorry for Dylan you don't have to feel sorry for Joel I'm Healed it's over I tell you what God did God did something so great with Rosella Griffith that that woman that came down there said I'm sorry for you her daughter was mixed up in drugs so bad she didn't even know who she was but said that girl Rosella Griffith called her up got her on the phone for 45 minutes and brought her to the meeting the next night and that girl said how do you know you're free Rosella she said because I'm Different the word said I'm here healed the word said I'm free and she stood there and watched that lady get free as well well if that kind of Glory could get in Rosella Griffith how much more can That Glory get on the inside of [Applause] you I don't need you to tell me I'm free I don't need you to tell me I'm forgiven the word says I am the word says I'm redeemed the word says I'm Healed the word says I'm forgiven the word says I'm going to make it the word says it the word the word the word who cares what the world says the word says [Applause] different you remember one brother brand standing there in birth FS you remember brother random begins to Fumble around with his Bible because he's looking for the scripture on birth pains remember his wife gives him a new Bible and there's couple pages that are sticking there together remember the priest had come to brother Brandon and hands him his Bible and he tells the prophet said Be steady God is fixing a move and out of there brother brandom comes and preaches on this day this scripture is fulfilled brother Bisal later on in life found that priest and went to him and T talked to him about that event and brother bis go asked him said he asked him said Do you believe him to be Elijah he said now this is what the priest said he said if he would have told me that he was Elijah I would have followed him all the way I love what brother brisol said he said but he said but Revelation is stronger than any man's words a man did not tell me this was Elijah Ron Spencer Homer Fraser Charlie Spencer did not tell me this was Elijah the word of God revealed to my heart that this was the Elijah Ministry what what that was to turn our hearts back to the faith that's why I believe that William brandom is none else than Malachi 4 I'm not ashamed of that Pillar of Fire I'm not ashamed of this Prophet I'm not ashamed of this message that was the veil that God was going to dwell his deity in but now that man's Ministry has revealed God's glorious plans and now is hiding behind once's Badgers behind once's good for nothings the glory of God is veiled in you I got one more quote and I'm closing I got a million more quotes but I'm going to close with this one Hallelujah let the musicians come but I want you to be attentive sister Beth I think anybody whether they's a preacher or not have preached after that song Church of the Living God here and on tape do you know where you stand do you know that you were called of God that the Holy Ghost Reigns in your heart and every word of God is real to you if y'all could read the quote with me it says congregation says amen oh brother how is Satan going to stand against that how is he going to stop that from growing how is he going to keep them signs from falling why you could throw them in jail they if you could I don't care what you do they done it tried it they rot it in jails they was fed to lines they were s asunder they were jerked to pieces you can't kill K it right a church that's predestinated those who he forew like he did Jesus he has called and those he's called he has Justified and those who he justified he's already glorified and predestinated now in the last days with every seed solded and everything in order the world is in its order the time is shaped up the church is in its order the seed the evening lights the signs of like he said as it was in the days of Sodom an angel of God the Holy Spirit coming down moving and Performing the signs that he did then Malachi 4 promised he would send it in the last day what he promised and we see all of that right here where where where and the church was saying amen amen amen he said do you love him amen he said sure right here in the last days a predestinated church knowing where they're standing at sowed with the seed of the holy spirit in the church Satan be careful Satan be careful come on somebody if you want to challenge the mind of God then God will accept the challenge Satan be careful Satan be careful come on somebody it ain't just for Hatty R come on I heard a prophet say it today he said he said had Right Said the right thing he said but that s phenician woman she had no claims on him as the son of David he said But Blind barus had every right to call him the son of David and healing was released to him brother randam said that blind bmus said the right thing and when the S phenician woman changed her language and said Lord he said she said the right thing to think that blind bmus and the S phenician woman and hat R were saying the right thing we tapping into a third pole Satan be careful what am I saying to you say the right thing say what them tapes say stay with this message live this message and Satan better be careful [Applause] he said this Prophet said this Prophet said that you were not predestinated to fall like he fell he said because you are predestinated to stand you cannot fall you are predestinated from the for knowledge of almighty God you are destined for a kingdom you're going to heaven you're going in a Rapture Satan be careful hallelujah hallelujah God's got some Glory plans come on he ain't just stopping with Brother s and sister Jenny's prodal Satan be careful come on somebody he didn't stop with me 17 years ago when he filled me with the Holy Ghost right there on the streets of Victoria Satan didn't know what he was doing but Satan be [Applause] careful you look at Titus Spencer that boy has had surgery after surgery after surgery after surgery you know what it is you know what it is it is Satan trying to stop the glory because as humans we can have plans but God's got different plans and if God will carry God will use Titus Spencer to stop the mouths of critics and ideologies and he'll stand and glorify the god of the heavens through the veil that was broken over broken after [Applause] broken you've been through war and you've been through hell you've been through torment they could throw us in the lines then they could throw us in jails but Satan better be careful they could try to stop this message and God try to tell me to go to sit down in my Pew but if you felt like I felt Satan be careful they can call us holy rollers they can call us and say all kinds of things about us and make all kinds of fun but Satan be careful they can try to stop my pastor's mouth Satan can try to give him cancer and shut him up and every have every critic in the world come against him and said he's cursed and said he's he's an doubter and says he's got sin in his life Satan be [Applause] careful we are veiling the power of the heavens go ahead brother Matt you remember when the prophet you remember when the prophet he was out there and he was he was working he was working and he was selling them lamps and them light bulbs he said before he said before I'd sell them anything he said I told him you just go ahead and Sample it a little bit and I'll come back if you like it good I'll come back and then you can pay me and he let him keep it and he found out he had more sales than a lot of people because people were able to sample the product well let me tell tell you something Full Gospel Lighthouse has sampled the product of
