[40:46] Mighty God that we serve ain't it good
[40:47] to be a
[40:49] Christian aren't you happy to be a
[40:51] Christian to say I found it all in him I
[40:54] tell you what these songs have been sung
[40:55] this morning that shout material right
[40:57] there I tell you we found the evidence
[41:00] of it and we found everything we found
[41:03] him
[41:05] Hallelujah reminds me one time we was we
[41:07] was down at sister Linda craiger's Mama
[41:09] we was preaching our funeral down there
[41:11] in Damascus Virginia I tell you it's
[41:13] that was probably one of the one of the
[41:15] funnest uh funerals I'd ever preached
[41:17] actually probably Grande Homer actually
[41:19] waited all of his life to preach a
[41:20] funeral like that and and uh it was I
[41:23] just put it like this it was straight up
[41:25] chaos walking in there and people was
[41:27] everywhere and they was talking and the
[41:29] funeral director said this is nothing
[41:31] compared to last night and I mean it was
[41:32] time to go preach and and uh start the
[41:35] funeral and people were just everywhere
[41:37] talking I mean it's pretty much like
[41:38] walking into a bowling alley in a in a
[41:40] in a church service and they were
[41:41] everywhere just to talking and
[41:43] everything and funeral Decor I said you
[41:45] going to do something he said no just
[41:46] going up there and start so I literally
[41:48] just got up there started and Guy
[41:50] hollered out hey shut up the preacher's
[41:53] talking and all of a sudden man it it
[41:56] turned from uh like that to a church
[41:58] service in a matter of seconds and and
[42:00] uh there's some there's some look like
[42:02] some biker people back there and dad hit
[42:04] a point while he was preaching and Matt
[42:06] and Adam was sitting back there at the
[42:07] back and all of a sudden this guy was
[42:08] dressed up in suit grabbed a hold of the
[42:10] other guy grabbed a hold of his knees
[42:12] said buddy i' shouting material right
[42:14] there dad hit some quotes about
[42:16] Stonewall Jackson you thought the South
[42:18] was going to rise again man
[42:22] so it's shouting material in this messag
[42:26] I can tell you you like brother brandham
[42:28] said it he said the least little touch
[42:30] of God is omnipotent and all we need is
[42:32] one little touch of him this
[42:34] morning one little touch how many came
[42:38] for a
[42:39] touch oh praise the Lord maybe you stand

[42:44] morning Sister Amy sent this song to my
[42:47] my wife this week and I don't typically
[42:50] sing songs that everybody sings or
[42:52] everybody sends over because sometimes
[42:54] songs don't mean nothing to you but and
[42:56] uh I like singing songs that mean
[42:58] something to you Grande Homer used to
[43:00] sing his song and I ain't going to just
[43:01] sing it because of that but I got to
[43:03] probably didn't I was out in the
[43:05] deerwoods the other day and I got to

[57:40] great God that's watching
[57:42] over looking forward to having brother
[57:45] Wayne with us next weekend and so I I
[57:49] thought he was going to get a standing
[57:50] ovation when you an announced it last
[57:53] night and
[57:56] and so we love brother
[57:58] Wayne this message has produced some of
[58:01] the greatest speakers in the entire
[58:03] world and and you know he he's just a
[58:07] he's just a he calls himself a
[58:10] hillbilly and uh we were I I I'll just
[58:14] you got a few moments he gave me an
[58:17] extra hour last night I won't take it
[58:19] but uh and so anyway brother Wayne and
[58:23] myself we were we were down in Pigeon
[58:26] Forge and we was we was up in the up in
[58:29] the mountain somewhere and and we were
[58:32] I'm not I'm not Connie and
[58:36] so Connie shaking her
[58:38] head you know there's some things that
[58:40] public don't need to
[58:42] know so brother Wayne was just we were
[58:46] we were standing on a bridge looking
[58:47] down at the at the at the river below us
[58:51] and and there was a there was a ranger
[58:54] standing beside of us and he was
[58:56] standing there and he said brother Ron
[58:59] he said I want you to look look look
[59:00] what's going on here and uh he was just
[59:03] talking about he said uh how how that
[59:06] you could trap the beaver that's coming
[59:08] out he said there's a beaver working
[59:10] right there and so he said watch it
[59:12] watch it said he comes around the the
[59:14] bend just right there and he's working
[59:16] and he's coming down and said if we went
[59:18] just a little further down said we could
[59:19] we could find out where his Den's at and
[59:22] Ranger said I've learned some things
[59:25] standing here beside
[59:27] you he said well I'm just an old country
[59:30] boy and so and I when I hear Brother
[59:33] Wayne preaching and all of a sudden
[59:35] he'll just drop some of those little
[59:36] nuggets about about those things of life
[59:39] and where he grew up and I I just I I
[59:43] remember some of those days and uh when
[59:45] he first started preaching and and uh I
[59:49] marveled at his gift as he be as is a
[59:51] young man and he has a phenomenal
[59:54] photographic memory
[59:56] and so we just are we're just privileged
[59:59] to have him with us next weekend he was
[1:00:02] at brother Tom Rays last weekend and
[1:00:04] he's at home this weekend and now he's
[1:00:06] going to be with us and so we're just
[1:00:08] thankful that he would take out time of
[1:00:10] his schedule to be with us for a couple
[1:00:12] of days and I think Bethany and Isaac's
[1:00:15] going to be with us as well and so we
[1:00:18] thank the Lord for what he's done for
[1:00:19] her amen I was I was uh
[1:00:28] I was just thinking about when we come
[1:00:30] to service and we're just kind of
[1:00:32] looking for that special moment in a
[1:00:36] service and you know sometimes whether
[1:00:38] it's a convention or whether it's a
[1:00:39] regular service you're just going God
[1:00:42] would you just give me that moment amen
[1:00:46] when the girl sang that just a moment
[1:00:48] ago I thought that's that's so nice
[1:00:51] that's so
[1:00:54] special we were at brother Tim prz and
[1:00:57] and brother Tim was uh had us to speak
[1:01:00] on Saturday night and we had a prayer
[1:01:03] line and probably 400 people came
[1:01:06] through the prayer line and and uh you
[1:01:08] guys were there with
[1:01:10] me and I was standing in the prayer line
[1:01:15] and this was kind of an unusual
[1:01:17] occurrence but there was a sister a a a
[1:01:21] minister's wife that had a specific
[1:01:25] prayer request that she was praying for
[1:01:28] and she was so heavy with this prayer
[1:01:31] request and it was for her
[1:01:34] family and she she it became so
[1:01:38] overwhelming that she felt like if I
[1:01:40] could just reach out and grab my
[1:01:42] husband's jacket I I just like to get a
[1:01:45] special prayer I'd like to have a moment
[1:01:48] well I'm I'm probably 15t from her and
[1:01:52] I'm just I'm just praying one for
[1:01:54] another one for another another and and
[1:01:57] the Lord starts speaking in my
[1:02:00] ear go pray for
[1:02:03] Abigail and so I looked down the line
[1:02:05] and I couldn't get to her at that point
[1:02:07] and I prayed for a couple of more and I
[1:02:09] looked down the line and there was an
[1:02:11] opening and I just took off now Matthew
[1:02:14] was taking care of me and all of a
[1:02:16] sudden I'm
[1:02:20] gone and Abigail opened her eyes and I
[1:02:23] took her by the hand and I began to pray
[1:02:26] for her and I told her exactly what the
[1:02:30] what she was dealing with exactly what
[1:02:34] her prayer request was
[1:02:36] for she had a
[1:02:40] moment now here's what I believe that
[1:02:43] he's the same God
[1:02:48] today now I believe he's the same God
[1:02:52] that comes and touches our hearts in a
[1:02:54] special way and
[1:02:56] and uh let's stand to our feet this
[1:02:58] morning and thank you for letting me
[1:02:59] share those things and isn't he
[1:03:02] wonderful to us amen
[1:03:04] amen now this week I this week uh
[1:03:09] elections on a lot of people's minds and
[1:03:13] and uh no I won't tell you who to vote

[1:03:32] that's you you and that's you and your
[1:03:35] pencil so you you do that and and uh

[1:03:42] want to get
[1:03:44] to there's a greater election has
[1:03:46] already
[1:03:49] happened and we were elected before the
[1:03:52] foundation of the world

[1:04:01] beings to call me in
[1:04:05] you and and brother

[1:04:12] God and if we're the Eternal thoughts of
[1:04:15] God there is eternal
[1:04:18] plans that are involved here so that's
[1:04:21] some of the things that I want to look
[1:04:23] at this morning John Wesley would say it
[1:04:25] like like this give me 100 preachers who
[1:04:28] fear nothing but
[1:04:30] sin and desire nothing but God and I
[1:04:34] care not a straw whether they be
[1:04:36] clergymen or
[1:04:38] laymen sit alone will shake the gates of
[1:04:43] hell and set up a kingdom of heaven on
[1:04:46] the earth I believe I'm a part of that
[1:04:49] don't you you'll turn with me to Acts
[1:04:52] chapter 9 and verse one this morning
[1:04:54] everybody hear me okay amen amen good to
[1:04:58] be here ain't
[1:04:59] it amen Acts chapter 9 and verse
[1:05:06] one and Saul yet breathing out
[1:05:09] threatenings and Slaughter against the
[1:05:12] Disciples of the Lord went unto the high
[1:05:16] priest and desired of him letters to
[1:05:19] Damascus to the
[1:05:22] synagogues that if he found any of this
[1:05:25] way whether they were men or
[1:05:28] women he might bring them bound unto
[1:05:32] Jerusalem I know he's just held the coat
[1:05:36] of
[1:05:37] Steven and watched him being slain and
[1:05:41] as he journeyed he came near to Damascus
[1:05:44] and suddenly there shined around about
[1:05:47] him a light from
[1:05:48] heaven and he fell to the Earth and
[1:05:51] heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul
[1:05:56] why persecutest thou
[1:05:58] me and he said who art thou Lord Brother
[1:06:02] Ram said he saw the pillar of fire and
[1:06:05] he recognized that was him and the Lord
[1:06:08] said I am Jesus whom thou persecute us
[1:06:12] it is hard for thee to kick against the
[1:06:15] PRS and he trembling and astonished said
[1:06:19] Lord what would they thou have me to do
[1:06:23] and the Lord said unto him arise and go
[1:06:26] into the
[1:06:27] City and it shall be told thee what thou
[1:06:29] must do and the men which journeyed with
[1:06:33] him stood
[1:06:35] speechless hearing a voice but seeing no
[1:06:39] man and Saul arose up from the earth and
[1:06:43] when his eyes were open he saw no man
[1:06:46] but they led him by the hand and brought
[1:06:49] him into
[1:06:51] Damascus and he was three days without
[1:06:54] sight and neither did he eat nor
[1:06:58] drink and there was a certain disciple
[1:07:01] of Damascus named
[1:07:03] ananas and to him said the Lord in a
[1:07:07] vision
[1:07:08] ananas and he said behold I am here Lord
[1:07:12] and the Lord said unto him arise and go
[1:07:15] into the street which is called straight
[1:07:20] and inquiring the house of Judas for one
[1:07:23] called Saul of Tarsus for behold he
[1:07:27] prayeth and he ha seen a vision a man
[1:07:31] named ananas coming in and putting his
[1:07:33] hand on him that he might receive his
[1:07:37] sight and ananas answered Lord now
[1:07:42] notice his response now Lord I have
[1:07:45] heard many by many of this man how much
[1:07:49] evil he hath done to thy Saints at
[1:07:52] Jerusalem and hear that he hath author y
[1:07:55] from the chief priest to bind all that
[1:07:59] call on thy
[1:08:00] name but the Lord said unto him go thy
[1:08:03] way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to
[1:08:07] Bear my name before the Gentiles and the
[1:08:10] Kings and the children of Israel for I
[1:08:12] will show him how great things he must

[1:09:05] Lord whether we're the speaker or the
[1:09:07] hearer we ask you to speak to us in a

[1:09:25] amen a't he good to
[1:09:27] us amen sister Anne I'm glad you got a
[1:09:30] good
[1:09:31] report amen that's we were worried about
[1:09:34] some of those things and so amen God
[1:09:37] bless
[1:09:38] you isn't he good to
[1:09:41] us last week I finished
[1:09:44] with with brother Greg and
[1:09:47] AAL and uh we we were standing here we
[1:09:50] were just conversing backwards and
[1:09:52] forwards and and I was talking to him
[1:09:55] about the that seal and how that that
[1:09:57] inspector puts a seal on a cargo on that
[1:10:01] on that box
[1:10:02] car before before that that it's able to
[1:10:06] leave and you cannot nobody cannot
[1:10:09] remove that seal until it gets to its
[1:10:12] destination and so the inspector has
[1:10:15] looked over that box car and makes sure
[1:10:18] everything is packed and it's packed for
[1:10:20] the journey it can make it over the
[1:10:22] bumps and the humps and the different
[1:10:24] kinds of things things and it can make
[1:10:26] it over as that train is traveling and
[1:10:29] it you see if it's not packed
[1:10:33] right it'll go down the tracks and after
[1:10:36] a while it'll begin to shake
[1:10:38] apart that's the reason we must have the
[1:10:40] Seal of the Holy
[1:10:43] Ghost we got to make sure that
[1:10:45] everything is just packed exactly right
[1:10:48] brother manam said as a Christian we've
[1:10:50] got to do some
[1:10:52] unpacking we got to get rid of some
[1:10:54] things of the world and we got to get
[1:10:56] get rid of the unpacking but there's
[1:10:58] also some things that we've got to get
[1:11:00] exactly right he us a term like a like
[1:11:04] it would be in a warship as brother
[1:11:06] Andrew's talking last night in the
[1:11:08] warships they would fire those old
[1:11:10] cannons and those cannons would be
[1:11:12] chained down and they would move those
[1:11:14] cannons from one side of the ship to the
[1:11:17] other side of the ship and put the put
[1:11:19] the end of that Cannon out the hole and
[1:11:22] they would shoot it and that Cannon
[1:11:24] would Shake can literally shake the
[1:11:26] whole ship when they would fire it but
[1:11:29] if it wasn't tied
[1:11:32] down a loose cannon would do the ship as
[1:11:35] much damage as it would be the one that
[1:11:38] was
[1:11:39] firing and that's the reason tempers and
[1:11:42] Malice and lust and
[1:11:49] jealousies all of those things have to
[1:11:51] be brought under the control of the Holy
[1:11:54] Ghost and it takes more than just a
[1:11:57] learn Behavior or vowing a vow or I'm
[1:12:01] going to do better or turning over a new
[1:12:03] Leaf we need a supernatural
[1:12:08] experience an indwelling of the Holy
[1:12:12] Ghost is it is it needful it's your
[1:12:16] token you won't get on a plane without
[1:12:19] without a ticket you won't get on a
[1:12:21] train without a ticket
[1:12:25] and you can't make the
[1:12:27] Rapture without the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:31] Ghost will you have an emotional
[1:12:34] experience maybe maybe not one thing
[1:12:37] about it it'll cause emotion in your
[1:12:41] life it'll bring everything under under
[1:12:44] subjection to you and and and under
[1:12:47] subjection of the word of God and and
[1:12:50] and one of the evidences that you'll be
[1:12:52] able to say Amen to every word of
[1:12:57] God even when it's something that causes
[1:13:00] bitterness on the inside of you or
[1:13:03] something that you just love and enjoy
[1:13:06] there'll be parts of the word that's so
[1:13:08] difficult but let me just say just keep
[1:13:12] eating just keep eating it are you with
[1:13:16] me now now I i' just like to to just
[1:13:21] start out here brother Brandon preaches
[1:13:23] a sermon on things that are to be it is
[1:13:27] not just coming from a prophetic voice
[1:13:30] but it's also a prophetic sermon into
[1:13:33] which that these are future events now
[1:13:36] God reminds us in this sermon and I want
[1:13:39] to give you a couple of quotes as we
[1:13:41] would begin he reminds us of this the in
[1:13:45] this sermon that we just didn't start
[1:13:48] out
[1:13:49] here in this
[1:13:52] life your birth year 196 1 or 1977 or
[1:13:57] 1982 that that wasn't where you
[1:14:02] started but you started before the
[1:14:05] foundation of the
[1:14:07] world brother man said God in the
[1:14:09] beginning being the infinite God he is
[1:14:13] infinite and we're infinite we're finite
[1:14:18] his mind is so much greater and in our
[1:14:22] finite mind cannot understand
[1:14:25] his great infinite wisdom but therefore
[1:14:29] when he speaks anything it may be seem
[1:14:33] very strange to us to hear him say a
[1:14:36] certain thing in the scripture but it's
[1:14:39] it's got to
[1:14:40] happen and I believe that his words will
[1:14:44] never pass away therefore I believe that
[1:14:47] God knowing that we in our little finite
[1:14:51] mind could not interpret his great mind
[1:14:56] he interprets his own
[1:14:58] word he doesn't need any interpreter he
[1:15:02] in he interprets his own word by
[1:15:05] vindicating that word in its season now
[1:15:10] he comes to you and he says your birth
[1:15:14] here was pre-planned
[1:15:18] I guess you believe that every one of
[1:15:21] you knows that our birth was pre-planned
[1:15:23] he said did you know that your being
[1:15:27] here never originated just at a myth or
[1:15:31] a thought everything was pre-planned by
[1:15:36] God before the foundational world that
[1:15:39] that you would be here the infinite God
[1:15:43] knowed he said and to be infinite he had
[1:15:47] to know every
[1:15:49] flea that would ever be on the
[1:15:52] earth it's quite quite astounding
[1:15:55] he said how many times that it would bat
[1:15:59] its
[1:16:00] eye he said that's
[1:16:04] infinite and our little Minds cannot
[1:16:07] fathom what infinite means the infinite
[1:16:12] God he knowed all things notice these
[1:16:15] next words therefore there's nothing out
[1:16:20] of cater
[1:16:29] you know you and I struggle over things
[1:16:31] that that don't mean
[1:16:35] anything I have to be honest with you we
[1:16:38] struggle over things that don't mean
[1:16:41] anything everything that you in this
[1:16:43] life is
[1:16:45] perishing and we get
[1:16:48] so wrenched and tore all to pieces about
[1:16:52] temporal things
[1:16:56] and yes I I understand I I'm fighting a
[1:16:59] very difficult thing but listen in the
[1:17:01] great scheme of this I'll Stand in the
[1:17:04] eternities and all of this will mean
[1:17:09] nothing are you with me now now watch
[1:17:12] watch what he says he says
[1:17:15] now he begins to say it and he lays the
[1:17:18] foundation he said the only way that you
[1:17:20] can be a son and daughter of God
[1:17:25] he said because you have to
[1:17:28] be have to have eternal
[1:17:33] life and there's only one
[1:17:37] form of eternal life and that's God's
[1:17:42] own
[1:17:45] life and the only one form of eternal
[1:17:49] life and that's God's own life there to
[1:17:52] be a son of God
[1:17:55] you had to be with him
[1:18:00] always the gene of Life spiritual life
[1:18:04] tonight was in God the Father before
[1:18:08] there was even a
[1:18:10] molecule and you are nothing but the
[1:18:14] manifestation of the gene of life that
[1:18:16] was in God as a Son of God and now
[1:18:20] you're
[1:18:21] expressed after his own word has comeing
[1:18:25] you to light up this
[1:18:29] age you couldn't have lived in another
[1:18:33] age you were only to live in this
[1:18:38] age how important are
[1:18:41] you how important are you Autumn if the
[1:18:45] en if the enemy ever tells you you're
[1:18:47] not important you just remind him of
[1:18:49] this
[1:18:50] thought God thought of me before the
[1:18:53] foundation of the world
[1:18:55] before there was a sun before there were
[1:19:00] stars I was with
[1:19:04] God and if you look at this you will
[1:19:06] never be
[1:19:08] lost if you were with him
[1:19:12] then this isn't hanging over a mistake
[1:19:15] today or
[1:19:18] tomorrow I don't know if I can make it
[1:19:20] it didn't hanging over your feelings or
[1:19:23] even your opinions
[1:19:25] you were God's thought before the
[1:19:27] foundation of the
[1:19:30] world Eternal in his mind in Eternal in
[1:19:35] his
[1:19:40] nature
[1:19:42] now I can imagine ananas as he gets
[1:19:47] word he gets word that I have I want you
[1:19:52] to go and there a man named Saul of
[1:19:56] Tarsus and Saul of Tarsus I want you to
[1:20:00] go lay hands on him and he's going to
[1:20:01] receive his sight and he begins to
[1:20:04] respond back to him
[1:20:07] says Lord I have heard many things evil
[1:20:10] of this
[1:20:13] man this man's carrying papers to kill
[1:20:18] murder ma destroy families destroy
[1:20:23] churches for the cause of
[1:20:29] religion you're talking about a
[1:20:31] perplexed Place brother Chris can you
[1:20:34] imagine in his thoughts God you're
[1:20:37] leading me into a
[1:20:39] trap am I the next
[1:20:42] stepen Brother Ray I I can imagine his
[1:20:46] his temporal
[1:20:48] thoughts is this God or is this or is
[1:20:51] this just a whim that I'm on
[1:20:55] am I being led to a death
[1:20:58] trap but God said he's a chosen
[1:21:03] vessel he's a chosen vessel unto me he's
[1:21:08] going to speak before
[1:21:11] Kings he's going let me just say he's
[1:21:14] going to be the first church age
[1:21:16] messenger he's going to write much of
[1:21:19] the New Testament
[1:21:25] are you with me
[1:21:27] now but he didn't he didn't seem like he
[1:21:30] was that kind of a
[1:21:32] fell at this point they recognized him
[1:21:35] as a
[1:21:39] murderer but when God begins to tell
[1:21:41] them I want you to understand you're
[1:21:45] looking at that which is in
[1:21:47] temporary and I've got something that's
[1:21:50] eternal
[1:21:54] you ever have a friend want to talk to
[1:21:56] you about the good old
[1:22:00] times oh back in the good old
[1:22:06] days that's a nice smile brother
[1:22:09] Kenny them weren good days to start off
[1:22:16] with them were some really bad days days
[1:22:20] I don't even want to tell my children
[1:22:22] none about
[1:22:24] we were we were sitting at Brother
[1:22:27] alden's house and and we were sitting
[1:22:30] there and having supper Friday evening
[1:22:34] and and a story came to me when I was a
[1:22:36] young boy and brother Alden said it
[1:22:39] across the table he's known me all these
[1:22:41] years and he said I'd never I'd never
[1:22:45] heard that
[1:22:47] story I don't know if I've even told my
[1:22:49] boys that
[1:22:51] story but listen all of that's the
[1:22:53] temporary
[1:22:55] part I I would tell it now but I don't
[1:22:58] want none of our young people to do what
[1:23:00] I
[1:23:06] did it wasn't that
[1:23:11] bad I jumped out of a second story
[1:23:15] window into a huge into a huge
[1:23:19] Bush and the principal was there to
[1:23:21] collect me
[1:23:25] somebody dared me to do it and about
[1:23:27] that time I heard the Dare and my feet
[1:23:28] left the
[1:23:33] floor I thought I was going to get a
[1:23:35] pounding I literally thought I was going
[1:23:37] to get a
[1:23:39] pounding and the and the
[1:23:42] principal left me for quite a while and
[1:23:44] he came back in and he said I I went to
[1:23:47] this
[1:23:48] school and I've been the principal of
[1:23:50] the school and I have taught at this
[1:23:52] school and he told me how many many
[1:23:54] years it had been since he jumped out
[1:23:56] that same
[1:24:00] window now you
[1:24:08] know brother B say God spoke it and said
[1:24:12] let there
[1:24:14] be and he said and let there be an Eden
[1:24:18] and let there be beautiful flowers and
[1:24:20] let there be my son and in my own image
[1:24:24] and stand over there in the Garden of
[1:24:27] Eden and let his bride stand by his side
[1:24:32] he did all that by the spoken word of
[1:24:36] God what are me and you doing here we
[1:24:39] are here by the spoken word of
[1:24:44] God and I just kind of want to pull some
[1:24:46] of these thoughts together this church
[1:24:49] maybe many of you don't know the origin
[1:24:51] of of us as a people
[1:24:55] but our our pastor that was here brother
[1:24:57] Homer Frasier no doubt when he got
[1:25:00] called to preach there was a lot of
[1:25:02] people like an
[1:25:05] ananas he's anything but a
[1:25:09] preacher but God chose him as a
[1:25:12] vessel and it may have started out in a
[1:25:15] basement and it may have started out in
[1:25:17] a in a in a in a little bitty building
[1:25:20] that was that was a wreck type of
[1:25:22] building and then in a ran in a house
[1:25:25] and and you worked on that house and
[1:25:26] made a church out of it and now we sit
[1:25:29] on this beautiful
[1:25:31] Hill but God knew what he was
[1:25:36] doing God knew what he was doing this is
[1:25:39] more than just a
[1:25:42] church and if I can say it we're more
[1:25:44] than just a
[1:25:46] people we are the Eternal thoughts of
[1:25:52] God now I I I want to just grasp a
[1:25:55] couple of your thoughts here just for a
[1:25:57] moment when we think about God releasing
[1:26:00] seeds into the Earth at a certain time
[1:26:04] at a certain place in a certain
[1:26:08] position they've got a purpose that
[1:26:10] they're going to do maybe your purpose
[1:26:12] won't be some of these but I want to
[1:26:14] just mention some of the
[1:26:16] impact God releases John Wesley onto the
[1:26:21] Earth John Wesley 5 foot
[1:26:24] one will preach
[1:26:28] 88,000
[1:26:33] sermons eight sermons a
[1:26:37] day I am not the one that calculated
[1:26:39] that I'm just Google that's a
[1:26:43] Google he was
[1:26:45] rocked and
[1:26:47] stoned and left for dead after many of
[1:26:51] his
[1:26:52] sermons some we preach a sermon and we
[1:26:55] walk out and I didn't I didn't land my
[1:26:58] sermon I I don't think it went past the
[1:27:01] pull pit and it fell listen John Wesley
[1:27:05] preached the word had no church to
[1:27:07] preach in at certain points of his
[1:27:09] ministry preached in the street and was
[1:27:12] hated by religious
[1:27:15] men and they would hated him so bad
[1:27:19] until they would throw stones on him
[1:27:22] trying to kill him and he would Shake
[1:27:25] himself after they were gone only to get
[1:27:28] up tomorrow and start preaching
[1:27:31] again his brother Charles was quite a
[1:27:34] songwriter and wrote wrote hundreds of
[1:27:37] songs for worship his mother would be
[1:27:41] the one that would write down much of of
[1:27:45] morning uh devotions for for John Wesley
[1:27:49] she's the one that wrote most of his
[1:27:50] devotional books and she was called the
[1:27:54] another a Methodist
[1:27:56] movement but it was nothing like the
[1:27:58] Methodist
[1:28:02] today Fanny
[1:28:06] Crosby she came into this life and not
[1:28:09] being able to
[1:28:10] see and you've heard her say it many
[1:28:13] times she wrote the song I shall know
[1:28:15] him I shall know
[1:28:17] him of all the songwriters of life and
[1:28:21] many have sold their gifts and obtain
[1:28:25] great things of life but Fanny Crosby
[1:28:29] refused to sell her
[1:28:32] gift and she would write the song pass
[1:28:35] me not oh gentle savior hear my humble
[1:28:39] cry another released to the earth a man
[1:28:42] named Charles Finny in Rochester New
[1:28:45] York and he had such a presence that
[1:28:48] when he preached as a matter of fact he
[1:28:51] preached and he sounded like he was very
[1:28:53] nasally
[1:28:54] and so when he
[1:28:58] preached they would ask they would ask
[1:29:00] why do people come out to see him preach
[1:29:02] he's an ugly man he said well they don't
[1:29:04] come to see
[1:29:06] me they come to see Jesus but there was
[1:29:10] such an impact of his preaching such an
[1:29:13] anointing that would fall on the
[1:29:15] community till men would would give
[1:29:18] their they would drop their lunch boxes
[1:29:21] five miles away from where he was
[1:29:23] preaching and give their heart to
[1:29:26] God what an impact that he had to where
[1:29:29] in the city there was no crime to where
[1:29:31] that even the police officers didn't
[1:29:33] have nothing to do and they became the
[1:29:35] barber shop
[1:29:39] quartets he still remember today but
[1:29:42] that denomination is nothing like it
[1:29:46] was Buddy
[1:29:48] Robinson I've actually preached in in a
[1:29:50] couple of places where that buddy
[1:29:52] Robinson preached brother Brandon would
[1:29:54] call him Uncle Buddy
[1:29:56] Robinson he was a man that would travel
[1:29:59] over two million miles in his life he
[1:30:02] would have over a 100,000
[1:30:04] conversions he would preach over 33,000
[1:30:08] sermons but here's where I want to tell
[1:30:10] you it all started in a
[1:30:14] field that's right and he had such a
[1:30:17] desire to have the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:22] Ghost he knew I can't do this on my
[1:30:27] own I can't live this on my own I've got
[1:30:31] to have the holy ghost in my life and
[1:30:34] one day he got so desperate before God
[1:30:38] until he draw a circle on the
[1:30:41] ground and got in the middle of that
[1:30:43] Circle and said if you don't fill me
[1:30:46] with the Holy Ghost when you return
[1:30:49] you're going to find my
[1:30:51] bones amen
[1:30:55] I think sometimes we've got to get
[1:30:57] desperate before God Amen everybody
[1:31:01] okay
[1:31:06] amen God would not only show brother
[1:31:08] brandom a vision of heaven or beyond the
[1:31:12] curtain of
[1:31:13] time but he would show him a vision of
[1:31:16] Hell at 14 years
[1:31:20] old and uh the reason I want to drop
[1:31:22] this here is we're
[1:31:25] Eternal and I I've got a couple of notes
[1:31:28] that I want to give you
[1:31:30] afterward brother BR says now after the
[1:31:32] vision struck me I was so weak I'd lost
[1:31:36] all that blood I thought I was sinking
[1:31:40] into an endless
[1:31:42] eternity as many of you heard me tell
[1:31:44] this before and sinking into an endless
[1:31:48] eternity first I was going down through
[1:31:50] the clouds and through darkness and
[1:31:53] sinking
[1:31:54] down down down and the first thing you
[1:31:58] know I I got into the regions of the
[1:32:01] lost and in there I screamed and and I
[1:32:04] looked and there was just everything
[1:32:06] there was no Foundation to
[1:32:09] it and he said I could not stop
[1:32:14] falling can you imagine I can't even
[1:32:17] imagine a thought of that I could not
[1:32:20] stop
[1:32:22] falling for eternity looked like I was
[1:32:26] going to fall there was no stopping
[1:32:29] nowhere and then what a difference it
[1:32:31] was from the vision I had here not long
[1:32:34] ago of being in
[1:32:35] glory with the
[1:32:38] people in glory with the people the
[1:32:42] contrast but in this I was
[1:32:45] falling I screamed for my
[1:32:49] daddy of course just being a
[1:32:52] kid that's what what I would do I
[1:32:55] screamed for my
[1:32:57] daddy and my daddy wasn't
[1:33:00] there I scream for my
[1:33:03] mother somebody catch
[1:33:06] me and there was no mother there and I
[1:33:10] was just going and I screamed in to God
[1:33:12] and there was no God there there was
[1:33:16] nothing there after a while I heard the
[1:33:19] most mournful sound that I ever heard
[1:33:22] that it was the awful feeling there is
[1:33:24] no way even a literal burning fire would
[1:33:28] have be a pleasure to the sight of what
[1:33:30] this was and those Visions has never
[1:33:34] been wrong and just one of the most
[1:33:36] horrible feelings that I ever had and I
[1:33:39] heard a noise sounding like some of of a
[1:33:42] haunted Affair and it when it was I
[1:33:45] looked coming and it was women and this
[1:33:47] green stuff and he said he said just
[1:33:51] could could just see their face and they
[1:33:54] had all this green stuff under their
[1:33:57] eyes and their eyes look like running
[1:33:59] back and and like women today paint
[1:34:02] their eyes and run back like that and
[1:34:05] and just their eyes and their face and
[1:34:07] they were going
[1:34:14] wooo and I screamed out oh God have
[1:34:17] mercy upon
[1:34:19] me have mercy upon me oh God where are
[1:34:24] you if you'll only let me go back and
[1:34:26] live I promise you I'll be a good boy
[1:34:30] and that's the only thing I could say
[1:34:32] God knows at the day of judgment he'll
[1:34:34] judge me for that statement that's what
[1:34:37] I said Lord let me go back and I promise
[1:34:42] you I'll be a good
[1:34:45] boy he relates it in countown and he
[1:34:48] says he said then I think of The Fifth
[1:34:51] Dimension as where the sinner dies and
[1:34:53] where he go goes I think that when a
[1:34:55] sinner dies he goes to a to this fourth
[1:34:59] dimension the first thing he cannot go
[1:35:01] to the presence of God because he is a
[1:35:05] sinner and his time is up here on Earth
[1:35:10] and there's a point I want to say his
[1:35:12] time is up on Earth and if I if I could
[1:35:16] type it to you it's like trying to sleep
[1:35:20] and you can't
[1:35:21] sleep and you're in a
[1:35:28] nightmare hideous
[1:35:31] things
[1:35:32] screaming listen I understand
[1:35:36] nightmares I understand nightmares
[1:35:38] because of what we
[1:35:40] fight sister Connie helps me many times
[1:35:43] during the night to come to myself and
[1:35:46] just to come to
[1:35:50] myself I cannot imagine living in a
[1:35:56] nightmare and I always think about in a
[1:35:59] nightmare no matter how bad it is I wake
[1:36:02] up and it's not
[1:36:05] real and it's not real here's what I
[1:36:08] want to drop right
[1:36:10] here if you're a sinner
[1:36:12] today you don't have to go
[1:36:18] there you don't have to go there if
[1:36:21] you're riding on the fence make a
[1:36:24] decision
[1:36:25] today while the spirit of God is drawing
[1:36:28] on you there's
[1:36:32] nothing let me preach there's nothing
[1:36:35] worth going to hell
[1:36:37] [Applause]
[1:36:51] for brother man said that's the
[1:36:54] state of the wicked
[1:36:59] dead he cannot go into the presence of
[1:37:02] God because he's a sinner and I want to
[1:37:05] say this to you I prayed much about
[1:37:07] reading this quote I prayed much about
[1:37:10] reading this
[1:37:12] quote this morning I was standing in my
[1:37:15] office and I was Lord you know I've got
[1:37:19] a lot of quotes I've got a lot of things
[1:37:21] but Lord are you sure you want me to
[1:37:23] drop that
[1:37:27] in and then it begin to deal with
[1:37:30] me can you imagine standing on the day
[1:37:33] of
[1:37:35] judgment brother brand would use a
[1:37:37] statement he said now the prostitute
[1:37:40] knows where she's
[1:37:43] going the
[1:37:45] drunkard he knows where he's
[1:37:47] going and we got have a lot of labels
[1:37:50] they know where they're going but can
[1:37:53] you imagine standing in the same
[1:37:58] line and have sit in brother brandom's
[1:38:03] Church sit in and watch the prophet of
[1:38:09] God where are all those people
[1:38:12] at where are they all at and then it
[1:38:16] come to the end and their life is over
[1:38:18] with and now they're standing in that
[1:38:20] line with drunkers and with all the able
[1:38:24] people what did you
[1:38:26] do I just didn't receive the
[1:38:30] word I just didn't receive the word I
[1:38:34] rejected the
[1:38:38] word how close can you
[1:38:42] be how close brother Ron but you're way
[1:38:45] off am
[1:38:49] I Jesus tells us of a rich young
[1:38:55] ruler that even Jesus loved him there
[1:38:59] will be people that you love so much but
[1:39:02] you as an individual cannot give them
[1:39:05] eternal life as much as you would want
[1:39:09] to God won't override your
[1:39:22] choice the Wicked dead he cannot go into
[1:39:26] the presence of God because he's a
[1:39:29] sinner he cannot return back to the
[1:39:32] Earth because his time's up he's caught
[1:39:37] between two
[1:39:38] things in this Fifth Dimension he's got
[1:39:42] a soul and it cannot go into the
[1:39:45] presence of God because it's not covered
[1:39:49] by the blood he's a sinner
[1:39:53] he cannot wake hisself
[1:39:56] up this is a powerful quote he cannot
[1:39:59] wake hisself
[1:40:01] up because his time is up on
[1:40:05] Earth and there is a
[1:40:08] tormented
[1:40:13] nightmare think of that
[1:40:15] now before you can enter a
[1:40:20] nightmare scream how many of us have
[1:40:23] have had nightmares it's just because
[1:40:26] we're told because the two consciouses
[1:40:28] are passing sub and first conscious and
[1:40:30] it catches between and that's a
[1:40:32] nightmare and when a sinner dies he's
[1:40:36] caught with his soul between Earth and
[1:40:40] Hell in a nightmare and there he
[1:40:47] stands I preached a sermon one time in a
[1:40:50] funeral it didn't have to be this way
[1:40:57] it didn't have to be this way there was
[1:41:00] a denominal preacher that preached right
[1:41:02] in front of me and he glossed everything
[1:41:04] up made it all pretty you know and
[1:41:08] afterwards he wanted to come back to the
[1:41:09] pull pit and he wanted to do it all over
[1:41:12] again and I preached the sermon it
[1:41:15] didn't have to be that way and he turned
[1:41:17] to me and said you would you didn't have
[1:41:19] to be so rough and I said one of us were
[1:41:22] telling the truth
[1:41:25] [Applause]
[1:41:36] you can't you can't dry in a you can't
[1:41:39] die in a drug addict
[1:41:44] stew you can't die in a moral condition
[1:41:49] in a horrible situation and inherit
[1:41:51] eternal life am let's just be honest you
[1:41:55] got to be born
[1:41:57] [Applause]
[1:41:59] again you got to be born again and I say
[1:42:04] this to
[1:42:05] you you don't have to go that way that's
[1:42:10] right but for a
[1:42:13] Believer here's where I want to drop
[1:42:15] this for a Believer this is as close to
[1:42:20] hell as we'll ever get
[1:42:24] [Applause]
[1:42:34] now brother brand would make this
[1:42:36] statement he says
[1:42:37] now he said those Eternal thoughts that
[1:42:40] are now manifested in flesh are the sons
[1:42:42] of
[1:42:44] God even as we are called we did not
[1:42:48] become Saved By The
[1:42:51] Rebirth we were seed and
[1:42:55] therefore were reborn for only the
[1:43:02] elect can be
[1:43:04] reborned because we were seed is the
[1:43:08] reason that we could be quickened in
[1:43:11] nonseed there's nothing to
[1:43:17] Quicken he said now hold this carefully
[1:43:19] in mind take this next step
[1:43:24] redeem means to buy
[1:43:27] back it restores to the original owner
[1:43:31] God by his death the shed Blood Bought
[1:43:36] back his
[1:43:37] own he bought back the spoken seed
[1:43:42] bride notice these words my seed my
[1:43:45] sheep hear my voice the word and they
[1:43:49] follow
[1:43:50] me you always were a
[1:43:56] sheep you never were a
[1:43:59] pig or a dog turned into a sheep that's
[1:44:04] right you always were a
[1:44:10] sheep that is it it is it is impossible
[1:44:14] for every kind of Life produces the same
[1:44:17] kind and there is no change in species
[1:44:20] as we were in his thoughts of God and
[1:44:23] then expressed into flesh there had to
[1:44:26] come today when we hear his voice the
[1:44:30] word and hearing that voice became aware
[1:44:34] of our father calling
[1:44:39] us Dylan you always were a Son of
[1:44:46] God turn to your neighbor I always was
[1:44:58] Hallelujah we were sitting at the table
[1:45:01] the other day and you was telling me
[1:45:03] about your family was here and they
[1:45:05] moved here and they moved there and they
[1:45:08] moved from pensilvania and move maybe to
[1:45:10] Florida then to South Carolina then to
[1:45:13] up up

[1:45:17] moving and all of that goings on and
[1:45:21] they were going backwards and forwards

[1:45:25] you

[1:45:34] was to get you
[1:45:36] here sister Nancy the first mother
[1:45:39] Church sitting over here listen went

[1:45:45] childhood a horrible childhood a
[1:45:48] divorced
[1:45:51] family we don't know
[1:45:54] that but it was all in the plan of
[1:45:58] God because she had to be at a certain
[1:46:03] spot that a wild
[1:46:06] boy would chase her around to church and
[1:46:10] kiss
[1:46:14] her listen she came from
[1:46:18] God are you with me and her life
[1:46:21] deposited look looked like it was
[1:46:24] horrendous but in all that

[1:47:19] gave them a vision of the word of God
[1:47:23] amen and it was all in the plan of God
[1:47:26] he was in the plan of God in a
[1:47:34] dungeon he's here he was in the plan of
[1:47:38] God in so many of your temporal
[1:47:41] situations things that you wrestle with

[1:48:21] times brother Doug I I'll just share
[1:48:24] this with you and cuz it's in my notes I
[1:48:27] probably prayed for you more then than I

[1:49:03] way but you and I will spend eternity

[1:49:09] [Music]
[1:49:10] [Applause]
[1:49:29] Paul struck off of his
[1:49:31] horse and he knows that's the pillar of
[1:49:44] fire we
[1:49:47] were we were at a meeting sister Nancy
[1:49:50] was with you and I sister Connie
[1:49:53] we was at a meeting at Brother Ray
[1:49:55] Ericson's that's when they were in their
[1:49:57] old
[1:50:03] church sorry I can't preach like Andrew
[1:50:06] now but hope I can still get my point
[1:50:09] across
[1:50:11] but we were there with brother
[1:50:14] bcll I didn't
[1:50:16] know I didn't know the week before he
[1:50:20] had preached a sermon and then the the
[1:50:22] sermon he said I'd like to hear I'd like
[1:50:26] to hear a
[1:50:27] preacher really go in depth about how
[1:50:32] Paul met that Pillar of Fire and then he
[1:50:36] just moved on he moved on to his
[1:50:39] thoughts so we go to the we go and of
[1:50:42] course I didn't hear that sermon and I
[1:50:44] go I go to to Brother Ray Ericson's and
[1:50:48] I'm preaching a meeting and I'm going to
[1:50:49] speak Friday
[1:50:51] night and and Saturday night and brother
[1:50:54] bisc is going to preach Sunday morning
[1:50:57] and he's going to preach a sermon called
[1:50:59] staying in the field and it was a
[1:51:02] phenomenal sermon how that Rahab the
[1:51:05] only Redemption place that she had was
[1:51:07] in that
[1:51:08] field and she wouldn't just work there
[1:51:11] but she would own
[1:51:12] it and so I came out and it it was on a
[1:51:16] Saturday night and I came out and I
[1:51:18] began to preach on Paul meeting the
[1:51:20] pillar of Fire
[1:51:24] and and meeting God for
[1:51:26] himself and that's where I stayed the
[1:51:28] entire sermon and I noticed brother
[1:51:31] Bisal was just
[1:51:34] bubbling months later I'm on my
[1:51:36] treadmill listening to a sermon that he
[1:51:39] preached the weekend
[1:51:41] before and I realized that he's uttered
[1:51:43] those words across the pull
[1:51:46] pit and talking about he'd like to hear
[1:51:48] a preacher talk about that and here I
[1:51:51] come we're thousands of miles
[1:51:55] apart I'm preaching on a moment here
[1:51:59] today listen we may be standing here in
[1:52:02] a clock of time but we're really in an
[1:52:04] eternal
[1:52:08] moment and and here I am preaching and
[1:52:11] brother bisc is sitting there and just
[1:52:13] eating it
[1:52:15] up not knowing what he's desired the
[1:52:18] week
[1:52:20] before they don't make me nothing but it
[1:52:24] just lets us know that we're in a
[1:52:29] channel and Paul had Saul of Tarsus has
[1:52:34] just held a coat for
[1:52:36] stepen he has watched him saying that
[1:52:40] there he stands at the right hand he
[1:52:43] stands and rebukes the denomination for
[1:52:46] not realizing who Jesus Christ is
[1:52:53] he goes all the way from Abraham all the
[1:52:56] way through to tell them who Jesus
[1:52:59] really
[1:53:01] is and standing there before that
[1:53:04] determined
[1:53:05] Council and standing there with those
[1:53:08] people and here is the first church age
[1:53:14] messenger here's the guy that you're
[1:53:17] going to read the scriptures behind 14
[1:53:21] books in the Bible that he's going to
[1:53:22] write under the inspiration of the Holy
[1:53:25] Ghost and here is that
[1:53:30] preacher with Steven's coat in his
[1:53:39] hand listen he felt like he was doing
[1:53:43] the right
[1:53:45] thing he had set at the feet of
[1:53:48] G who had been there where Jesus was at
[1:53:52] and Jesus preached in g h
[1:53:54] him he had been
[1:53:57] there and he had seen phenomenal
[1:54:00] things and listen he was zealous for his
[1:54:05] church and this Jesus
[1:54:07] business he didn't he had only heard
[1:54:10] stories of
[1:54:11] it but he was so zealous for the
[1:54:15] word he felt like this was a cult and he
[1:54:18] was trying to put it
[1:54:20] out he was trying to destroy this
[1:54:24] Antichrist movement that he thought that
[1:54:26] they was but there's just something
[1:54:29] about God when you meet
[1:54:32] him I'm talking about when you meet him
[1:54:37] when it's not your mama or your daddy's
[1:54:39] or somebody else's influence but when
[1:54:42] you meet
[1:54:45] God it settles the sin
[1:54:48] question it settles every question in
[1:54:51] your life
[1:54:53] and then every devil in hell can come
[1:54:55] against you and it don't shake you
[1:55:00] [Applause]
[1:55:29] I want you to think of what a how God
[1:55:34] operates God lets
[1:55:37] Gale train the first church age
[1:55:40] messenger
[1:55:43] amen of all of the ins and outs of the
[1:55:46] church
[1:55:52] he lets him see the
[1:55:55] hypocrisy he lets him see the social
[1:55:58] inner workings of what that Pharisee
[1:56:02] system is amen God allows him to become
[1:56:07] their
[1:56:07] most outstanding
[1:56:11] student he looks like he's on his way to
[1:56:15] being even the high priest
[1:56:19] order he looks like everything's right
[1:56:22] in
[1:56:23] plan that is going to rise right to the
[1:56:27] top and then God by his eternal thought
[1:56:31] interrupts the
[1:56:33] plan aren't you glad that God
[1:56:36] interrupted your
[1:56:38] [Applause]
[1:56:48] plans you were riding to church in a
[1:56:51] horse and buggy
[1:56:53] and you thought it was the right thing
[1:56:54] to do and you saw The Good the Bad and
[1:56:57] the
[1:57:00] Ugly you wrote ours to
[1:57:04] church cold
[1:57:10] buggies difficult
[1:57:13] situations and for you thought
[1:57:15] everything was fine and then God just
[1:57:18] interrupted the
[1:57:21] plan Hallelujah and he'll shake your
[1:57:24] whole
[1:57:26] Community are you with me he's not de
[1:57:28] he's not delicate I heard I heard Andrew
[1:57:30] preach last night about the
[1:57:32] war he's not delicate about causing a
[1:57:35] war in your home a war in your family
[1:57:39] cuz the seed that is there is not a
[1:57:42] temporary seed
[1:57:52] sometimes you like to rub the kitty a
[1:57:53] little bit and get everything to settle
[1:57:55] back down God's got a bigger plan than
[1:57:58] some temporary
[1:58:01] [Applause]
[1:58:08] feeling you imagine God allowed Moses to
[1:58:11] be trained by
[1:58:13] Pharaoh the best schools the best
[1:58:16] Architects headed to be the next pharaoh
[1:58:19] and God interrupted the plan
[1:58:24] he understood the political system the
[1:58:27] social workings of the greatest army
[1:58:29] that there was the building of huge
[1:58:38] monuments brother
[1:58:40] Joy when God spoke to him he never told
[1:58:44] him when he was looking out the window
[1:58:48] the same window that Pharaoh looked
[1:58:50] out and he saw the children of God and
[1:58:53] Pharaoh saw
[1:58:58] slaves God just didn't happen to speak
[1:59:01] to him and said okay
[1:59:04] Moses of
[1:59:06] Egypt in a few days you're going to be
[1:59:11] homeless in a few days everybody that
[1:59:13] loves you is going to hate
[1:59:15] you sometimes when you hear the truth
[1:59:18] all of the sudden the truth drops into
[1:59:19] you and it's what you've been looking
[1:59:21] for all your life and you think
[1:59:23] everybody's going to love what I just
[1:59:25] got and then their World Turns Upside
[1:59:29] Down and you feel homeless you feel
[1:59:32] helpless you feel unloved god what have
[1:59:36] you done to
[1:59:37] me you just broke through the shell and
[1:59:41] realized I'm an
[1:59:43] eagle hallu
[1:59:45] [Applause]
[1:59:56] brother Brandon would use a term called
[1:59:58] Paul a
[2:00:01] prisoner now I must point out and ask
[2:00:03] you at this
[2:00:07] point what are you a prisoner
[2:00:19] to you you got a picture beside to our
[2:00:22] governor last
[2:00:25] night you stood just feet away from
[2:00:28] Donald
[2:00:29] Trump last
[2:00:31] night and I I'm sure that was quite a
[2:00:35] quite a
[2:00:36] moment but you're sitting with the most
[2:00:38] important people in the
[2:00:43] world those
[2:00:45] men if there isn't a supernatural change
[2:00:49] will stand in the line of the judgment
[2:00:57] you spent time you said with young child
[2:01:00] hung child last night and his wife and
[2:01:03] you you made the statements that he's
[2:01:05] not even he's in the wrong Pol he's in
[2:01:08] the wrong
[2:01:11] Arena a lot of good men go into
[2:01:13] politics and become
[2:01:19] rotten why you say that brother Ron
[2:01:22] brother brandom said
[2:01:28] it I think if I would ask you
[2:01:31] today what do you believe is the most
[2:01:33] famous president of the United States of
[2:01:37] America I think the majority of us would
[2:01:40] go Abraham
[2:01:43] Lincoln for those that have a different
[2:01:47] answer it's
[2:01:49] okay but do you know Abraham Lincoln was
[2:01:51] the most hated president that ever set
[2:01:55] in the United States of
[2:01:58] America Abraham lincol did not even take
[2:02:01] the train that they sent for him to come
[2:02:03] to the uni to Washington because he knew
[2:02:07] that there was 11 different
[2:02:10] assassination attempts that was going to
[2:02:12] happen on his life instead he went to
[2:02:15] New York and then came down and the
[2:02:18] pinkertons are the men that actually
[2:02:21] took care of him him to watch over him
[2:02:23] that he could live to get to Washington
[2:02:26] that's right and they tried to
[2:02:28] assassinate him over and over and over
[2:02:32] again while he was in the
[2:02:35] office now you think about that you
[2:02:38] think well brother Ron you're talking
[2:02:40] politics I'm I've got it way higher in
[2:02:42] politics
[2:02:43] now it wasn't it wasn't drunks that were
[2:02:47] trying to do it it wasn't harlots that
[2:02:50] were trying to do it it was the
[2:02:52] political systems that was trying to
[2:02:55] destroy
[2:02:58] him come on church yet he held himself
[2:03:02] true and he held himself firm in a world
[2:03:07] that was falling apart
[2:03:23] many people that you work with are
[2:03:29] prisoners if you and I could sit down
[2:03:31] for a little while you could tell me
[2:03:32] what prison life is about there's a lot
[2:03:35] of things that you disdained it and you
[2:03:37] hated it you absolutely hated it I'm
[2:03:42] just pointing you out I hope that's okay
[2:03:44] you hated
[2:03:47] it brother Shannon I'm going to say
[2:03:49] something very difficult here
[2:03:52] God had to allow him to go there to
[2:03:55] where he could talk to
[2:04:00] him sometimes God allows you to fall in
[2:04:03] the most difficult
[2:04:07] situations to where he can talk to
[2:04:12] you where he can get you
[2:04:15] alone to where he can have a burning
[2:04:17] bush experience or a road to Damascus
[2:04:21] experience exp
[2:04:22] erience and he has to close your eyes to
[2:04:26] the point till you're blind till you're
[2:04:28] begging for
[2:04:37] help can I borrow just a little bit more
[2:04:40] time
[2:04:50] here when Jesus was on the
[2:04:56] cross brother brandham asked brother
[2:04:59] bcll how many people died there that
[2:05:03] day he said
[2:05:06] three three
[2:05:09] died at
[2:05:11] Calvary he said
[2:05:13] no he said four died at
[2:05:17] Calvary four
[2:05:19] died and brother bisco said I was just
[2:05:21] blew away right he said I blew away he
[2:05:25] said I was just sunk in the
[2:05:28] religion and what I was
[2:05:31] taught and he said Jesus and Judas
[2:05:36] perished and two thieves
[2:05:39] perished and Jesus took
[2:05:42] one and Judas took
[2:05:47] one now I want to take that and go
[2:05:49] somewhere for just a few minutes
[2:05:52] where would you rather
[2:05:56] be if you're standing and and you're
[2:05:59] watching the
[2:06:02] scene it's obvious Judas has told sold
[2:06:06] out Jesus and he can't live with
[2:06:11] himself and here's two thieves that
[2:06:13] deserve to be there but there's a man
[2:06:16] speaking in
[2:06:19] tongues and he's performed for
[2:06:21] phenomenal
[2:06:23] Miracles but he's dying for me and you
[2:06:27] you can't see that but that's what he's
[2:06:31] doing and one is making fun of
[2:06:35] Jesus and the other
[2:06:38] one is rebuking the other
[2:06:42] Thief brother Denny he never heard a
[2:06:47] sermon he never saw a miracle
[2:06:54] but something on the inside of him
[2:06:59] Eternal something on the inside of them
[2:07:02] that was
[2:07:03] eternal said
[2:07:06] Lord remember
[2:07:11] me when you come into Paradise
[2:07:27] never heard a sermon never saw a miracle
[2:07:31] deserved to
[2:07:35] die and he spent all of his
[2:07:39] life he spent all of his
[2:07:43] life
[2:07:46] wasted had a horrible
[2:07:49] reputation he deserved to on this
[2:07:53] cross but something inside of
[2:07:57] him saw a
[2:08:01] man from another
[2:08:04] realm a king from another
[2:08:10] kingdom
[2:08:13] Lord the same way Paul would say
[2:08:19] Lord remember me
[2:08:27] I Jo On My Mind sister
[2:08:29] Rochelle this
[2:08:33] morning I don't know how to put all this
[2:08:43] together I'll just have to say this to
[2:08:48] you there were men on the ground making
[2:08:51] fun of
[2:08:53] him with all their cloaks of
[2:08:57] religion with their screams brother
[2:09:00] Steven going if you are the Son of God
[2:09:04] cast bring yourself down we'll follow
[2:09:07] you and they paid him a compliment
[2:09:09] brother Bram
[2:09:13] said but whether they live a minute or
[2:09:17] 20 years they're going to hell
[2:09:21] and I just read to you about what hell
[2:09:23] is a
[2:09:25] nightmare and they stepped from the
[2:09:27] dimension of making fun of the the one
[2:09:29] that could save them from that spot to
[2:09:32] that Dimension to where they can't wake
[2:09:34] themselves
[2:09:35] up and there's a man on the cross
[2:09:39] saiding remember me and he's done
[2:09:41] nothing
[2:09:43] worthy but he recognized who he
[2:09:46] was and Jesus turns and gives him
[2:09:48] eternal life
[2:09:51] and when there's no
[2:09:53] pharaoh and when there's no sports stars
[2:09:57] and when there's no
[2:09:59] politicians th'll be a
[2:10:05] thief standing in an eternal
[2:10:12] body he never heard a sermon and never
[2:10:16] saw a miracle
[2:10:31] Andrew am I getting where I need to
[2:10:37] get what about the religious people on
[2:10:39] the ground
[2:10:44] today what about them
[2:10:47] today they made fun of the prophet
[2:10:52] what about the believe the sign
[2:10:56] people I don't generally do this but
[2:10:58] where are they going to
[2:11:01] stand where are they going to stand all
[2:11:04] their letters and videos and
[2:11:07] criticisms you know it's not so much
[2:11:09] they call my name but they blasphemed on
[2:11:13] one even call brother brandom a gay man
[2:11:23] I going to tell you what hell's
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:42] hot I better leave that
[2:11:46] alone how
[2:11:49] close how close you can come to eternal
[2:11:56] life how
[2:12:01] close how
[2:12:06] close we're being influenced from one
[2:12:09] dimension or
[2:12:12] another and here's where you got to be
[2:12:13] real
[2:12:15] careful because not only is God trying
[2:12:17] to influence
[2:12:18] you the enemy tries to influence
[2:12:22] you you can be a positive 100%
[2:12:26] Christian and yet get a around D
[2:12:31] doubting
[2:12:32] Thomas and walk away with questions in
[2:12:35] your mind to which you have to rebuke
[2:12:38] out of your own mind being a
[2:12:42] Believer I have walked out of meetings
[2:12:46] where phenomenal miracles happen listen
[2:12:49] I walked out of a meeting you just you
[2:12:51] just actually spoke at this place
[2:12:53] brother Chris and actually walked out of
[2:12:56] the meeting where a man had staged for
[2:12:58] cancer with weeks to live didn't know
[2:13:01] nothing about the message but was
[2:13:03] invited brought his daughters his family
[2:13:06] and and during the meeting I went back
[2:13:08] and prayed for that man and that man got
[2:13:12] totally 100% well went back and saw
[2:13:15] Miracle after Miracle after miracle that
[2:13:18] took place brought marriages together
[2:13:21] brought things together people receive
[2:13:24] the Holy Ghost standing in that same
[2:13:26] prayer line I walk out of the
[2:13:30] building and walk up to a woman that
[2:13:34] rebukes
[2:13:39] me and says only brother brandham can do
[2:13:42] those things and starts going off and
[2:13:44] going
[2:13:46] off what' you do brother Ron I felt
[2:13:49] sorry for her that's right
[2:13:52] cuz we just saw
[2:13:54] God no man can do those
[2:13:58] things no man can do those things but
[2:14:02] here's a woman catches a critical spirit
[2:14:04] in the
[2:14:10] meeting listen we're going to spend
[2:14:13] eternity
[2:14:15] somewhere brother Ron there's no eternal
[2:14:17] hell you'll think it's Eternal in 10
[2:14:19] minutes amen that's true thank God
[2:14:23] there's an end to
[2:14:24] it thank God there's an end to
[2:14:29] it but you're eternally separated from
[2:14:34] God why you bringing this brother Ron
[2:14:38] let me just say you and I rubbed
[2:14:40] shoulders with very temporary
[2:14:44] beings
[2:14:47] amen if you ever heard anything in your
[2:14:50] life set very very attentive right now
[2:14:54] brother Andrew said wake
[2:14:56] up you're rubbing
[2:14:59] shoulders with a lot of
[2:15:02] people from another dimension
[2:15:05] amen that are headed for a
[2:15:09] nightmare that's where they're headed to
[2:15:12] don't let them influence you
[2:15:23] I want to say this to especially to our
[2:15:24] young people listen this is not our
[2:15:31] home this is not our
[2:15:34] home you guys live in beautiful homes
[2:15:38] you live in nice homes you live in
[2:15:40] peaceful homes listen there's people all
[2:15:42] over the world would give anything to be
[2:15:45] able to live in your homes
[2:15:51] homes that are peaceful that are
[2:15:55] caring that love one another homes that
[2:15:59] have food to eat have a bed to sleep on
[2:16:03] have your own personal
[2:16:06] room I'm preaching to you now I think
[2:16:09] sometimes we become a very unthankful
[2:16:13] people you need to thank God for what
[2:16:15] you have right
[2:16:17] now not dreams of what you're going to
[2:16:20] have what you have right
[2:16:23] [Applause]
[2:16:43] now I finish
[2:16:47] now I don't want us to take ever come to
[2:16:50] these services and take it for
[2:16:59] granted I don't want us to ever take it
[2:17:01] for
[2:17:03] granted sister Beth we sitting in
[2:17:06] Heavenly places in a very special
[2:17:09] way I think you understand
[2:17:13] that and God has watched over our lives
[2:17:16] to to bring us
[2:17:18] here and that's around the world
[2:17:22] I don't think everybody has to move here
[2:17:25] this message is all over the world and I
[2:17:28] think every church every God ordained
[2:17:30] church has an atmosphere in it that's
[2:17:33] and listen it's more than a man listen
[2:17:36] we don't come to feed on a man we come
[2:17:38] to feed on the Holy Ghost on the Christ
[2:17:41] the reveal word and and Andrew said
[2:17:43] something last night and in my notes and
[2:17:45] I'm going to go past it listen if all we
[2:17:48] saw was Wigan Brandon we missed the

[2:17:54] Spencer or Andrew or Donnie Reagan or
[2:17:56] Tim pu if that's all we saw we missed
[2:17:59] the whole picture it's
[2:18:03] Christ it's him living on the inside of

[2:18:12] weigh out

[2:22:11] something for
