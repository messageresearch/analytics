[47:31] given to mary by an angel
[47:34] amen not just any angel but the
[47:38] announcing angel
[47:41] gabriel himself
[47:44] said this about god
[47:48] hallelujah
[47:51] for with god nothing
[47:56] shall be impossible
[47:59] i want i want you to read this with me
[48:01] and i want you to put emphasis on it
[48:04] for with god nothing
[48:07] shall be impossible now i want you to
[48:10] speak to your
[48:11] impossibilities
[48:14] right here this morning because
[48:17] mountains aren't going to speak
[48:18] and rocks are not going to speak it
[48:21] takes a believer
[48:22] and the difference between you and the
[48:24] average bear
[48:27] is that you're a son and daughter of god
[48:31] and anybody can read the bible that has
[48:33] the ability to read but
[48:34] as believers we have position with god
[48:38] we have more authority than even gabriel
[48:40] had
[48:44] and gabriel is saying there's nothing
[48:46] impossible with god
[48:49] and he's speaking to a little virgin
[48:50] that's going to conceive
[48:52] and have a child never knowing a man but
[48:55] it's been prophecy
[48:57] for for hundreds of years
[49:00] but the the time is going to intercept
[49:04] with prophecy and it's going to come to
[49:07] pass
[49:08] you're the people of rapture
[49:13] are you with me you're the people of
[49:15] rapture and i want to read it one more
[49:17] time
[49:18] for with god nothing shall be impossible
[49:22] you may be seated this morning
[49:26] hebrews chapter 11 and verse 5 says it
[49:29] like this
[49:30] by faith this is our type of rapture
[49:33] because we're going to leave the earth
[49:35] and there's
[49:36] many of us that are not taste of death
[49:40] and they'll just reason away we've went
[49:42] away somewhere another but there's going
[49:44] to come a universal rapture
[49:46] around the world this message has went
[49:50] into every nation
[49:51] and this message has rapture inside of
[49:54] it
[49:55] [Music]
[49:56] we're just walking like enoch walked
[50:01] by faith enoch was translated
[50:06] that he should not see death and was
[50:09] not found because god had translated him
[50:15] for before his translation he had this
[50:19] testimony that he pleased god
[50:23] i'm going to do something i'm not doing
[50:25] anything that's
[50:26] wrong here but i want i want you to read
[50:28] your name right here
[50:33] because this is your type
[50:37] and i want you to read your name i don't
[50:38] want to be vocal this morning
[50:40] you that's on the internet i want you to
[50:42] do it
[50:44] for by faith ron
[50:48] spencer was translated
[50:51] that he should not see death and was
[50:55] not found because god had translated
[50:59] him for before his translation
[51:02] he had this testimony that he pleased
[51:06] god
[51:08] oh let's add church but without faith
[51:12] it is impossible to please him for he
[51:16] that cometh to god must believe that he
[51:19] is
[51:19] and that he is a rewarder of them
[51:23] that diligently seek him
[51:26] [Applause]
[51:30] hallelujah brother brandon made this
[51:32] statement improving his words
[51:35] this is powerful short but it's powerful
[51:38] eternal life
[51:41] you always was
[51:45] see you have eternal life and there's
[51:47] only one form of it and that's god
[51:50] you were his attribute he thought of you
[51:53] and knowed you before the foundation of
[51:57] the world
[51:58] in his mind and he would use this
[52:02] quotation i came from god
[52:04] and i'm going back to god i say it this
[52:07] morning i came from god
[52:09] and i'm going back to god i love my mom
[52:12] and daddy but that
[52:14] listen god thought of me before my mom
[52:16] and daddy ever thought of me
[52:18] because i was an attribute of god before
[52:20] the foundation of the world
[52:24] the scripture says in hebrews chapter 1
[52:26] now
[52:27] faith is the substance of things hoped
[52:30] for
[52:30] the evidence of things not seen
[52:35] for by it the elders obtained a good
[52:38] report
[52:39] and through faith we understand that the
[52:42] worlds were
[52:43] framed by the word of god so that
[52:47] things which are seen were not made
[52:50] of things which do appear
[52:53] brother brandon would tell us he said
[52:55] god spoke it
[52:57] and believed his own word
[53:02] in colossians chapter 1 and verse 15
[53:06] who is the image of the invisible god
[53:08] the firstborn of every creature
[53:11] for by him were all things created
[53:14] that are in heaven and that are in earth
[53:19] amen now we're preaching on an an uh
[53:22] unlimited god here
[53:27] for by him were all things created
[53:32] i don't care what science says
[53:35] that are in heaven and that are in earth
[53:39] visible and invisible
[53:43] whether they be thrones or dominions
[53:46] or principalities or powers
[53:50] all things were created by him
[53:53] and for him let's say that together all
[53:56] things
[53:57] were created by him and for him
[54:01] he is before all things and by him all
[54:05] things consist i'm in that
[54:08] all things consist
[54:10] [Applause]
[54:12] nothing happens by chance there's no
[54:15] accidents
[54:16] with a child of god the footsteps of the
[54:20] righteous are ordered of the lord
[54:23] i feel like i'm standing in 10 000 watts
[54:26] of energy up here
[54:28] hallelujah all things
[54:32] and he is before all things and
[54:35] by him all things consist
[54:39] he is the head of the body the church
[54:42] who is the beginning the firstborn
[54:45] from the dead that in all things he
[54:48] might have the preeminence for it please
[54:52] the father that in him
[54:54] should all fullness dwell
[54:57] and having made peace through the blood
[55:01] of his cross
[55:02] by him to reconcile all things unto
[55:05] himself
[55:06] by him i say whether they be things in
[55:08] earth or things in heaven
[55:11] and you now notice god brings you right
[55:14] into this
[55:16] and you that were sometimes alienated
[55:19] and enemies in your mind by wicked's
[55:21] work yet
[55:22] now have he reconciled
[55:27] hallelujah hallelujah
[55:31] god knew where what a wretched vow that
[55:33] we would be
[55:34] coming into this sin cursed earth in
[55:37] this body
[55:39] but god that was rich in mercy through
[55:42] his life he saved us
[55:45] [Music]
[55:46] glory he didn't leave us in that
[55:50] nasty condition but he raised us up
[55:53] [Applause]
[55:55] didn't patch us up he raised us up
[55:58] and we became a new creation
[56:02] not the old man made over anew but he
[56:05] made us a new creation
[56:07] you couldn't do that to yourself
[56:16] this is more than psychology
[56:19] this is more than making a vow and then
[56:22] trying to live it
[56:24] this is more than turning over a new
[56:26] leaf god
[56:29] you he gives you a new spirit
[56:33] so that he can live with you
[56:35] [Applause]
[56:38] aren't you glad of that brother man said
[56:39] now he gives you a new spirit
[56:41] so god can live with you then he gives
[56:44] you his holy spirits
[56:47] and the holy spirit is your god and your
[56:49] leader
[56:50] that'll watch over your life and nothing
[56:53] happens
[56:54] in your life that he takes by chance
[56:56] he's watching over your
[56:58] lives
[56:59] [Applause]
[57:03] in the body of his flesh food that
[57:05] through death to present you
[57:06] holy unblameable unreprovable
[57:11] in his sight that's enough to shout when
[57:14] god looks down at you
[57:16] well brother ron i can't see myself
[57:18] perfect it's not it's not so
[57:20] important to how you see yourself it's
[57:22] important how god sees you
[57:26] brother ron but i've got a long story
[57:28] i've got a i've got a
[57:29] mess i can't untangle the webs in my
[57:31] life don't you worry god knows how to
[57:33] untie
[57:34] knots he knows how to untie your life
[57:37] he knows where you're at you're in
[57:40] trouble god knows how to fix
[57:42] [Applause]

[59:50] jesus and he shall be great and shall be
[59:54] called the
[59:55] the son of the highest and the lord god
[59:58] shall
[59:59] give unto him the throne of his father
[1:00:01] david
[1:00:02] and he shall reign over the house of
[1:00:04] jacob forever

[1:00:09] telling her the potential of the seed
[1:00:12] that is being placed
[1:00:14] in her womb you have heard the angel in
[1:00:17] this dispensation

[1:00:24] you the potential

[1:00:29] reign as the queen of heaven
[1:00:31] [Applause]
[1:00:32] you will live in the city in the seventh
[1:00:36] step of the city
[1:00:37] you are the people of the open book
[1:00:41] the bible had been closed by
[1:00:43] denominational creeds
[1:00:45] for 2 000 years but god opened the bible
[1:00:49] to you
[1:00:50] as the bride of jesus christ
[1:00:52] [Applause]
[1:00:53] [Music]
[1:00:54] and you're the people of rapture that
[1:00:57] can
[1:00:57] walk alive so pleasing to god
[1:01:01] that god can justify himself to take you
[1:01:05] off of the earth that you will not see a
[1:01:08] tribulation
[1:01:11] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:25] hallelujah and the angel answered her
[1:01:29] and said unto the holy ghost shall come
[1:01:31] upon thee
[1:01:32] and the power of the highest shall
[1:01:34] overshadow thee
[1:01:36] and therefore also that holy thing we
[1:01:38] shall be born of thee
[1:01:40] shall be called the son of god
[1:01:47] for that portion of that scripture will
[1:01:50] be the reason
[1:01:51] that he will be crucified
[1:01:56] not because he healed their sick not
[1:01:59] because he raised their dead
[1:02:01] but when he said i and my father won
[1:02:04] they took up stones to stone him not the
[1:02:06] disciples
[1:02:07] but when jesus called himself god and
[1:02:11] identified him as the messiah
[1:02:13] that i'm here
[1:02:15] [Music]
[1:02:16] the religious people with their
[1:02:19] denominations wanting to crucify him
[1:02:28] now notice he has not only
[1:02:31] got mary in his mind but miles away
[1:02:35] there's a woman named elizabeth
[1:02:40] god's always concerned about you never
[1:02:43] come to the spot that you think god's
[1:02:45] forgot you
[1:02:49] and behold thy cousin elizabeth
[1:02:52] she has also conceived a son and in her
[1:02:55] old age
[1:02:56] and this is the sixth month with her
[1:03:00] who was called barren amen
[1:03:05] unlimited god
[1:03:09] unlimited god god doesn't change
[1:03:12] elizabeth back to a young woman
[1:03:16] like he did sarah but he took an old
[1:03:19] woman that was barren
[1:03:20] [Music]
[1:03:22] and gave her a son that was now
[1:03:25] dead in the womb
[1:03:28] and and and mary said behold the
[1:03:31] handmaid
[1:03:32] notice now full with god
[1:03:36] nothing shall be impossible and mary
[1:03:39] said behold the handmaid of the lord
[1:03:42] be it unto me
[1:03:45] brother ron i just don't know what to
[1:03:47] say sometimes
[1:03:48] in a service listen this is a good
[1:03:51] response
[1:03:52] be it unto me according to thy
[1:03:56] word
[1:04:00] and the angel departed from her
[1:04:03] i had a reason to say it like i just
[1:04:05] said it
[1:04:07] because sometimes brother jeremy do you
[1:04:10] have that
[1:04:11] picture that i sent to you last week do
[1:04:14] you still have that available
[1:04:23] let's see more

[1:05:52] now you know we get requests here that
[1:05:54] are sometimes
[1:05:55] horrendous and and sometimes the doctor
[1:05:59] tells you you've got cancer
[1:06:01] turns out that you don't but you you
[1:06:05] when you hear the word cancer just sends
[1:06:07] a chill through you
[1:06:08] that's right it sends your life right
[1:06:11] before you
[1:06:12] and and and i pray for those needs very
[1:06:16] very strongly because i know what the
[1:06:18] dread is
[1:06:20] you know and then you get news good news
[1:06:22] in a few days and you're just so
[1:06:23] relieved
[1:06:25] but but it was christmas a year and a
[1:06:28] half ago that
[1:06:29] i i got news i thought i had a prostate
[1:06:32] infection
[1:06:33] didn't tell you that but i thought i had
[1:06:35] a prostate infection
[1:06:36] something wrong there and i had been
[1:06:38] suffering for for a couple of months
[1:06:40] with that i had some
[1:06:42] situations that was going on and
[1:06:46] and then i got the news that dr uh
[1:06:50] buckwalter would give me the news he
[1:06:52] said
[1:06:53] i'm sending you down a dark road i
[1:06:56] didn't know what that dark road was
[1:06:58] but i've been in some dark roads
[1:07:02] i've been in some dark roads i just
[1:07:05] talked to brother tim pruitt on the way
[1:07:06] here to the service and sister karen is
[1:07:10] is now responding she's saying a few
[1:07:13] words she's aware that you're in the
[1:07:15] room she kind of knows who everybody
[1:07:17] is and brother tim reminded i i just
[1:07:20] reminded brother tim i i just kind of
[1:07:22] conversed with him about what i was
[1:07:24] speaking this morning
[1:07:25] and he said brother ron you were worse
[1:07:29] than what sister karen was i was in a
[1:07:32] i was in a non-responsive place and the
[1:07:35] doctors would even say
[1:07:36] brain dead then they would would tell
[1:07:39] they would begin to tell us later that
[1:07:42] i was just hours away from them
[1:07:44] requesting that even i would take my
[1:07:46] my organs five hours actually with the
[1:07:49] term that they used
[1:07:50] and so and so brother tim had
[1:07:54] had came to this meeting to to come to
[1:07:58] see me
[1:07:58] and many ministers that came to pray for
[1:08:01] me and
[1:08:02] lay their hands on me and pray for me
[1:08:04] you had prayed
[1:08:06] and brother tim comes dispatched by by
[1:08:08] god himself to
[1:08:10] come and come and speak to to
[1:08:13] see me in the hospital and and he said
[1:08:16] he just told me the other day he said
[1:08:18] what i walked in was worse than i could
[1:08:20] have ever imagined
[1:08:22] he said but i knew i had a word in my
[1:08:24] heart to preach
[1:08:26] in that state i wasn't able to speak
[1:08:28] with him and
[1:08:30] and so you know i i brother tim and
[1:08:33] brother homer would host brother tim
[1:08:36] and and so anyway brother tim would walk
[1:08:39] to the pulpit
[1:08:41] and i want to remind you here
[1:08:44] no service is not important
[1:08:52] no service is not important it is
[1:08:55] just as important and and i i may shock
[1:08:58] you right now
[1:08:58] but it's just as important as gabriel
[1:09:01] giving instructions to mary
[1:09:08] are you with me now let me just say this
[1:09:11] you
[1:09:11] so many times people come to a service
[1:09:14] and there'll be parts of it that they go
[1:09:15] well i really enjoyed that part
[1:09:18] and then another part they'll sort it
[1:09:19] out and just kind of throw that away
[1:09:24] and they've actually missed what god is
[1:09:26] saying to them
[1:09:28] and if you pay careful instructions no
[1:09:31] you don't need brother branham to call
[1:09:33] you out
[1:09:34] tell you your name and your address you
[1:09:36] know that
[1:09:37] many of you don't need to know the
[1:09:39] diseases that are in your body
[1:09:41] many of you already know that
[1:09:44] but the god that is in control of our
[1:09:47] lives
[1:09:48] [Applause]
[1:09:49] walks to the pulpit in the form of a
[1:09:51] vessel
[1:09:52] and he begins to speak the words of life
[1:09:57] and then you grab a hold of it and you
[1:10:00] begin to believe it with all your hearts
[1:10:03] those words have power
[1:10:06] [Applause]
[1:10:08] i'm speaking about an unlimited god
[1:10:11] don't you shut down on me now
[1:10:13] it ain't a good time
[1:10:19] sister kaniwa would leave the hospital
[1:10:24] actually late to come to the service
[1:10:30] and i fell into that non-responsive
[1:10:33] state
[1:10:36] it was just gone i want to give you
[1:10:40] my part of it
[1:10:46] and i was laying there and i watched
[1:10:49] connie go out
[1:10:52] of the room she'd come back in later
[1:10:58] and i remember
[1:11:01] i remember just seeing light
[1:11:05] a light and i remember seeing a tunnel
[1:11:12] and i felt my life leaving my body
[1:11:17] and these are the thoughts that i
[1:11:19] thought
[1:11:23] this must be what it's like to die
[1:11:28] and it was like a light switch went off
[1:11:33] now in the medicated coma
[1:11:37] when you walked into the room i knew who
[1:11:40] was there
[1:11:42] much of the time and could
[1:11:45] hear words and even brother biscuit will
[1:11:49] instruct sister connie
[1:11:50] make sure that you speak
[1:11:54] positive to brother ron
[1:11:58] and even brother homer would say that as
[1:12:00] well
[1:12:03] make sure you speak positive things
[1:12:05] because they say the hearing
[1:12:07] is the last to go
[1:12:12] and that's true it's very true
[1:12:17] but as i slipped away sister connie
[1:12:20] knowing that you know i hear people talk
[1:12:23] about excuses of missing church
[1:12:32] and she left me
[1:12:35] knowing i was non-responsive because
[1:12:38] this word is more important
[1:12:41] than the temporary that she saw
[1:12:51] this church is without excuse
[1:13:00] imagine what her heart was doing
[1:13:06] after a month and now he's
[1:13:09] he's non-responsive she gets in the car
[1:13:13] and she makes a journey
[1:13:14] across it this mountain right here
[1:13:18] she comes in and she sits
[1:13:22] down
[1:13:27] behind sister joyce and sister evelyn
[1:13:33] and they ask how is he and she said he's
[1:13:36] bad
[1:13:40] but that didn't stop her from the word
[1:13:43] are you with me now i know i've caught
[1:13:46] you some of you by your breath
[1:13:49] but i mean too
[1:13:52] my brother my buddy brother tim pruitt
[1:13:54] is standing in the pulpit in just a few
[1:13:57] moments
[1:13:58] and his wife is in the condition that
[1:14:01] she's in
[1:14:04] and he is faithful at his post of duty
[1:14:07] [Applause]
[1:14:10] how stupid satan must be
[1:14:16] and i'm doing this with purpose this
[1:14:19] [Applause]
[1:14:26] morning this thing
[1:14:28] told me that just moments literally
[1:14:31] seconds before i walked out
[1:14:33] that i was getting ready to drop into a
[1:14:35] danger zone of sugar
[1:14:37] i drank a coca-cola standing right there
[1:14:40] i'm not scared of the devil
[1:14:42] [Applause]
[1:14:45] are you with me i'm not apologetic to
[1:14:48] have coca-cola sitting on my
[1:14:49] my my my pulpit this morning
[1:14:53] cause i've got a word to preach and
[1:14:56] satan wants to fight against it
[1:14:59] he's defeated
[1:15:25] brother tim pruitt that is getting ready
[1:15:27] to preach this morning
[1:15:29] in louisiana at his church walk through
[1:15:32] this pulpit
[1:15:34] and he begins to preach
[1:15:40] and he preaches two sermons
[1:15:44] now it's more what i have laying in
[1:15:46] front of me is more important to me than
[1:15:48] even a recording
[1:15:51] my wife said in this meeting
[1:15:55] and as she does in every service she was
[1:15:58] beginning to write
[1:15:59] notes the title of his sermon
[1:16:03] is god will have a testimony
[1:16:07] i want to remind you sister karen god
[1:16:10] will have a testimony
[1:16:20] i didn't ask connie for permission of
[1:16:22] this but it's too late anyway
[1:16:25] these are her notes and i'm going to
[1:16:26] read them verbatim
[1:16:28] our daily walk with god
[1:16:33] trials satan
[1:16:36] can't destroy us until
[1:16:39] god gives him permission
[1:16:43] now remember i'm standing here 14 years
[1:16:45] later
[1:16:46] after being brain dead
[1:16:51] god is in control
[1:16:54] there is a reason for everything
[1:16:59] the lord delivers them out
[1:17:02] of them all right satan is only a tool
[1:17:07] in the hand of gods in god's hand
[1:17:11] real christians with heart disease
[1:17:16] and cancer real christians

[1:17:28] war
[1:17:36] families with financial problems
[1:17:41] the lord says that you're going to have
[1:17:44] tribulations
[1:17:45] the word says you're going to have
[1:17:47] tribulations
[1:17:49] they're given to you for a reason
[1:17:53] then you ask the question where was god
[1:17:56] at it produces spiritual growth
[1:18:00] we cannot understand god's grace we can
[1:18:04] under not
[1:18:04] understand that the footsteps
[1:18:10] of the righteous are ordered
[1:18:16] satan i hope you're listening god
[1:18:19] gives us footsteps through our cross
[1:18:22] and he makes a promise that i'll be with
[1:18:25] you
[1:18:26] even in you to the end of the world
[1:18:29] you're not alone you're not even having
[1:18:31] the energy to carry yourself

[1:24:09] america

[1:24:44] personal testimony
[1:24:45] that i've experienced a living god in my
[1:24:48] life

[1:25:00] and put it in a cocoon and gave me the
[1:25:02] holy ghost and now i fly like a
[1:25:05] butterfly
[1:25:06] sting like a bee
[1:25:12] [Applause]

[1:25:52] meeting today and looking at your
[1:25:54] circumstances
[1:25:55] and hearing the word of the lord as it's
[1:25:58] preached

[1:26:27] it doesn't matter how long it takes
[1:26:29] god's god's not necessarily in a hurry
[1:26:32] sometimes
[1:26:34] but abraham kept confessing forgive me

[1:26:41] words move like a thought you say
[1:26:44] whatever you
[1:26:45] you whatever you say speak it

[1:26:59] i want you to say that out loud i'm a
[1:27:02] serpent bruiser
[1:27:06] did 40 of this audience say that
[1:27:09] i'm a serpent bruiser
[1:27:18] as we walk with god
[1:27:23] we can face our storms
[1:27:27] and reflect the morning star
[1:27:30] and have songs of victory
[1:27:36] not of this world that's right amen they
[1:27:39] leave that service
[1:27:41] you heard those notes
[1:27:46] and i stayed like that
[1:27:49] until somewhere around seven o'clock the
[1:27:52] next morning
[1:27:55] but there was a man that can turn on the
[1:27:58] lights
[1:28:03] brother tim pruitt said it
[1:28:07] at cracker barrel and prayed with sister

[1:28:36] they hear my voice
[1:28:43] and sister connie said that was one of
[1:28:45] the greatest moments in her life
[1:28:47] when she heard my voice
[1:28:50] come on church god knows how to raise
[1:28:53] the dead
[1:28:55] brother on do you believe you were the
[1:28:57] worst case no sir
[1:28:59] because jesus had a friend
[1:29:01] [Applause]
[1:29:03] they've done buried him they've done put
[1:29:04] the stuff on him
[1:29:06] they had wrapped him up they had called
[1:29:08] for jesus to come and jesus
[1:29:10] didn't come but jesus is always on time
[1:29:15] he was fellowshipping in another realm
[1:29:17] with believers
[1:29:19] and he heard a voice call back to him
[1:29:22] because
[1:29:22] jesus was the master of death
[1:29:26] hell and the grave and
[1:29:29] jesus called lazarus by name you talking
[1:29:32] about an unlimited god let me remind you
[1:29:35] here

[1:29:38] not called him by name
[1:29:40] there would have been a general
[1:29:41] resurrection
[1:29:42] [Applause]
[1:29:46] hallelujah
[1:29:51] i want to remind you one of these
[1:29:53] mornings that resurrection voice
[1:29:55] is going to call our loved ones out of
[1:29:58] the grave they're going to step from
[1:30:00] that room to this room

[1:30:06] twinkling of an eye

[1:30:13] they're going to step from that
[1:30:14] dimension to this dimension
[1:30:17] because the word that they went down
[1:30:20] believing
[1:30:21] it's still effective
[1:30:24] [Applause]
[1:30:30] it wasn't just effective for brother
[1:30:32] homer to preach it here
[1:30:34] but it's still effective for him right

[1:37:37] mouths
[1:37:38] the lion's mouth that's right daniel

[1:37:51] god they
[1:37:52] are the sons of god for ye have not
[1:37:56] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:37:58] fear
[1:37:58] but ye have received the spirit of
[1:38:00] adoption whereby we cry about father
[1:38:03] the spirit itself therefore beareth
[1:38:05] witness with our spirit
[1:38:07] that we are the children of god
[1:38:10] brother i don't know if i'm a christian

[1:38:28] the most important part of your week
[1:38:30] that ought to tell you where you are i
[1:38:32] have no question where i'll be on
[1:38:34] rapture morning
[1:38:36] because where i'm sitting here today

[1:38:40] rapture morning oh
[1:38:45] somebody wind that clock back let's have
[1:38:47] church
[1:38:47] [Applause]
[1:38:49] and if children then heirs and heirs of
[1:38:51] god and join heirs with christ
[1:38:53] if you are an heir he owns it all
[1:38:58] he is unlimited than the unlimited power
[1:39:01] of god
[1:39:02] he has placed on the inside of you
[1:39:06] and you take him at his word and you
[1:39:08] take faith and believe it and speak
[1:39:11] [Applause]
[1:39:15] [Music]
[1:39:17] oh glory he's infinite
[1:39:21] he's omnipotent

[1:39:32] all wisdom all time covers all space and
[1:39:35] all power
[1:39:36] he's evident
[1:39:44] and if he isn't god then if he isn't
[1:39:47] if he isn't all of that he's not god he
[1:39:54] can't do all things he's not almighty
[1:39:56] god
[1:39:57] but he is almighty god
[1:40:00] he can do all things so that's the way
[1:40:05] we have to believe him
[1:40:08] [Music]
[1:40:16] it was several years ago i was here
[1:40:20] and i took sister connie's notes and i
[1:40:23] shared them with you this morning
[1:40:25] now i'm going to share another deal
[1:40:28] someone called me
[1:40:31] back when that believed the sign
[1:40:33] nonsense happened
[1:40:36] and they called me and they they were
[1:40:38] telling me that brother branham did not
[1:40:40] pray for king george
[1:40:46] and they were very abusive
[1:40:50] toward me and very non-congenial if
[1:40:53] that's the word
[1:40:56] non-diplomatic
[1:40:59] you know
[1:41:03] very abusive you know it's just like the
[1:41:07] rain in the sky noah preached it
[1:41:10] because god said so
[1:41:16] you can argue about 16 people on a
[1:41:18] bridge
[1:41:20] we just take a prophet at his word
[1:41:23] sword in the hand we take a prophet at
[1:41:25] his word
[1:41:28] brother brady who was here
[1:41:33] with us preaching and he had preached
[1:41:34] every year to that point
[1:41:36] and a couple years after that brother
[1:41:39] brady was here i did not dare say a word
[1:41:42] to brother and sister brady
[1:41:44] about what i had went through that week
[1:41:46] and
[1:41:47] and it was a couple of different calls
[1:41:49] that had came and
[1:41:51] what was going on and so brother brady
[1:41:55] had
[1:41:56] started his service and he was preaching
[1:41:59] and he i was sitting where andrew was
[1:42:01] sitting
[1:42:03] and brother brady was very he was very
[1:42:06] preaching and
[1:42:07] all of a sudden he said and you're a
[1:42:10] witness of this
[1:42:12] he just stopped he said let me just
[1:42:13] answer a question here
[1:42:18] and he said back when we were
[1:42:21] working in a house as a servants
[1:42:24] sister brady and myself we were working
[1:42:27] for the queen mother
[1:42:30] and we were working for how many to
[1:42:31] remember this now
[1:42:33] and he and he said can you expand the
[1:42:35] audience just now
[1:42:39] just raise your hand how many were here
[1:42:41] and hear this and brother brady was just
[1:42:43] he was just saying he said we were
[1:42:45] working in the house and we'd get them
[1:42:47] up at a certain time and he began to
[1:42:48] describe
[1:42:49] some of the things that they did for the
[1:42:51] people that worked there that was there
[1:42:54] they actually worked the kitchen they
[1:42:55] worked this service they
[1:42:57] they they took care of them they had to
[1:42:58] dress a certain way as a servant
[1:43:00] and they would take care of them go in
[1:43:02] and ring a little bell to wake them up
[1:43:03] and
[1:43:04] to help them get dressed and all these
[1:43:06] things sister brady was
[1:43:08] dressing the queen mother and it was
[1:43:11] the day before they were to leave
[1:43:15] and go into the full-time ministry the
[1:43:18] queen mother
[1:43:19] asked her said why are
[1:43:22] why are you leaving why why are you
[1:43:24] leaving the house
[1:43:27] don't we treat you good and just went
[1:43:28] through a lot of things and that's not
[1:43:30] important now
[1:43:31] but remember sister brady was the one
[1:43:34] with the bad
[1:43:35] feet and she sends a letter you can
[1:43:38] imagine it wasn't an email but she sent
[1:43:40] a letter to brother brady
[1:43:42] in north carolina and he got the letter
[1:43:45] and it was to have
[1:43:46] have a minister pray for her feet
[1:43:50] because they were swell so bad you
[1:43:52] couldn't walk
[1:43:53] then imagine being a serpent and having
[1:43:55] that condition and brother brady is here
[1:43:58] and they take him to brother branham's
[1:43:59] meeting and he said and in two services
[1:44:02] and on the second service
[1:44:04] brother brandon was preaching what is
[1:44:05] the attraction on the mountain
[1:44:08] and if you remember he was talking about
[1:44:11] prophecy
[1:44:12] becoming history and they were telling
[1:44:16] brother brady that
[1:44:17] this is elijah this is the fulfillment
[1:44:20] of malachi 4
[1:44:21] 5 and 6 and these things were new
[1:44:23] brother brady says these words
[1:44:26] he said from the first time i heard
[1:44:29] brother
[1:44:29] branham speak i knew he was a prophet
[1:44:32] to this generation it don't take two
[1:44:36] years
[1:44:36] six months it don't take the convention
[1:44:39] the seed in you
[1:44:42] [Applause]
[1:44:44] hallelujah you're watching by the way of
[1:44:46] the internet and you're battling this
[1:44:48] message

[1:44:53] tell you
[1:44:54] you need a conversion
[1:44:58] you need a real conversion you need
[1:45:00] christ in your life

[1:45:16] yourself to hell
[1:45:18] god makes a way of resting for you run
[1:45:21] to the ark of safety while there's time

[1:45:39] friends you can ever have in your life
[1:45:42] i'll fight for you when you give up
[1:45:53] brother brady's repeats
[1:45:56] what the queen mother she said
[1:45:59] remember forgive me a lot of things are
[1:46:02] running in my mind my mind's going a
[1:46:04] million miles an hour
[1:46:12] i grew up with a man named charlie
[1:46:14] mitchell and i only want to bring this
[1:46:15] here
[1:46:16] to to give a testimony of two witness
[1:46:19] charlie mitchell had a tumor in his left
[1:46:20] lung
[1:46:21] it was cancer he was gonna kill him
[1:46:24] brother fulcher who was my dad's pastor
[1:46:27] at that time
[1:46:28] took him charlie that was dying
[1:46:32] the doctors couldn't do anything with
[1:46:33] him but he took him
[1:46:36] to the meeting they couldn't sit in the
[1:46:38] front but charlie was sitting
[1:46:40] in the back and you can hear
[1:46:44] brother branham call out to him i
[1:46:46] listened to charlie many years of my
[1:46:48] childhood
[1:46:49] listen to him tell the testimony sister
[1:46:52] suzanne i'm sure you heard it too
[1:46:55] charlie said it was like an eye
[1:46:59] and he said i actually ducked my head he
[1:47:01] said it was an eye and he said
[1:47:03] i knew i couldn't it wasn't brother
[1:47:05] branham
[1:47:06] i could see an eye and it was looking
[1:47:09] and in just a moment he said mr mitchell
[1:47:13] he calls him by name right you got a
[1:47:16] tumor on your left lung
[1:47:22] knew that
[1:47:25] brother brady is sitting there with the
[1:47:27] letter in his pocket
[1:47:28] right amen brother brady does the same
[1:47:32] thing he said there was an eye
[1:47:35] they came looking and he said
[1:47:39] i got my head i never seen nothing like
[1:47:40] this remember brother brady had been in
[1:47:43] a meeting
[1:47:44] where brother branham had walked out of
[1:47:46] the back door on the pulpit
[1:47:48] and he walks across that's all right
[1:47:52] i'm going to go just a little over time
[1:47:53] but i feel like this is going to be all
[1:47:55] right
[1:47:57] and brother branham walks out of the
[1:47:59] office
[1:48:00] and when he walks out on the pulpit
[1:48:05] he turns his back and starts calling out
[1:48:09] people in the audience
[1:48:12] to be to be exactly called out 14
[1:48:16] people in the audience and
[1:48:19] told them multiple things about them
[1:48:21] that was going wrong
[1:48:24] more than a man was there
[1:48:29] more than a man was there this is more
[1:48:32] than william branham's message
[1:48:34] hallelujah if you were in noah's day
[1:48:37] noah would meet you at the door
[1:48:40] for the haters of brother branham to get
[1:48:42] in a rapture
[1:48:43] you're going to have to meet brother
[1:48:44] branham at the door
[1:48:45] [Applause]
[1:48:49] i'm not apologizing for that statement
[1:48:51] you'll have to meet the messenger
[1:48:53] at the door
[1:48:54] [Applause]
[1:48:58] oh brother ron but you guys follow a man
[1:49:00] who are you following
[1:49:01] [Applause]
[1:49:03] we don't worship the man but we worship
[1:49:05] the god that lived inside of that man
[1:49:08] and we saw so much god until people
[1:49:10] confused him
[1:49:11] as god
[1:49:14] [Applause]
[1:49:16] but may that be your testimony that you
[1:49:18] live a life
[1:49:19] so pleasing to god until people confuse
[1:49:23] [Applause]
[1:49:26] you
[1:49:30] i feel good
[1:49:49] mr brady i see you come across water
[1:49:53] you're from jamaica
[1:49:57] it's about your wife brother brady said
[1:50:00] i started checking my pocket
[1:50:02] the letter was still there i hadn't
[1:50:04] shared it with nobody and now he knew
[1:50:06] god knew his name
[1:50:07] he knew where he was from he knew his
[1:50:09] wife was in condition
[1:50:11] listen he didn't need nobody else to
[1:50:13] convince him that this message was right
[1:50:15] [Applause]
[1:50:16] [Music]
[1:50:17] i don't need nobody to convince me this
[1:50:19] message is right
[1:50:20] brother kenny we've seen enough of god
[1:50:25] we've seen enough of god if he never
[1:50:27] does nothing else for us
[1:50:28] we've seen enough of god to say that's
[1:50:31] absolutely correct brother branham
[1:50:33] be it unto me according to thy word i
[1:50:37] believe what the angel is said unto me
[1:50:39] i'm going to speak it and i'm going to
[1:50:40] believe it
[1:50:43] listen folks i'm here to tell you i
[1:50:45] believe this message so much
[1:50:47] i believe that if it raised me from a
[1:50:49] brain-dead condition
[1:50:52] they told me i never walked again when i
[1:50:54] broke my back from
[1:50:55] every vertebrae all the way into my neck
[1:50:58] still still scars are there let me just
[1:51:01] say when they said i'll never walk again
[1:51:03] i simply responded to the doctor that
[1:51:05] night
[1:51:06] you don't know who you're talking to
[1:51:08] [Applause]
[1:51:18] hallelujah
[1:51:23] now sister brady had that experience
[1:51:27] more than a message but she had an
[1:51:28] experience with her feet
[1:51:31] she's standing on the feet that god
[1:51:32] healed
[1:51:36] and so she mentions to the mother
[1:51:40] of the queen
[1:51:45] we believe a message of william
[1:51:48] marion branham amen
[1:51:51] and the queen responds i met him
[1:51:56] amen i met him
[1:52:01] he came and prayed for king george
[1:52:04] for your information she told exactly
[1:52:08] how that they brought him in
[1:52:10] said they swept him in secretly by night
[1:52:14] i said king george wasn't the only
[1:52:16] miracle
[1:52:18] he touched me when i stepped by
[1:52:21] brother brady and sister brady watch
[1:52:22] every service that i preach
[1:52:25] they know it's the truth amen
[1:52:30] god bless you brother tom
[1:52:33] god bless you by the way brother tom
[1:52:36] he'll heal you that condition
[1:52:38] he's greater than their condition
[1:52:46] i was sitting in the meeting
[1:52:50] and god was so mindful of the situation
[1:52:54] he would let brother brady tell the
[1:52:58] story i stood for god only days before
[1:53:03] and so god confirmed it in this pulpit
[1:53:11] and by the way king george played golf
[1:53:14] the next day
[1:53:15] amen
[1:53:24] can you give me about five more minutes
[1:53:41] i'm going to have some people stand up
[1:53:42] here in just a moment
[1:53:52] i want to preface this with something
[1:53:53] now
[1:53:57] i'm just who i am and god built me the
[1:54:00] way he is
[1:54:02] i'm not a good preacher and
[1:54:06] i heard someone say here lately that
[1:54:09] said when you're not a good preacher god
[1:54:11] has to give you gifts
[1:54:13] well i'm okay with that too
[1:54:20] so
[1:54:28] let me explain to you brother tim pruitt
[1:54:30] is a great dreamer
[1:54:31] god gives him dreams and he will only
[1:54:33] have one
[1:54:34] on occasion but he knows it's from the
[1:54:37] lord
[1:54:38] mother donny's brother donnie reagan is
[1:54:41] a phenomenal preacher
[1:54:43] and we all love his gift we'll have him
[1:54:45] here in a few days i hope you're
[1:54:46] praying about those meetings and it just
[1:54:49] seems like that when brother donnie
[1:54:51] speaks it's like
[1:54:52] it's like you're an hour hour and 20
[1:54:55] minutes just goes
[1:54:58] and we enjoy his gift we enjoy the gifts
[1:55:02] that are in the body
[1:55:03] we enjoy the jason jacksons we enjoy
[1:55:07] that that thunderbolt preaching that
[1:55:09] gripping
[1:55:10] i enjoy the tom ray the passion of the
[1:55:13] word
[1:55:14] i enjoy the danny steam i could call it
[1:55:17] for quite a long
[1:55:18] time i look past the man and see god
[1:55:21] [Applause]
[1:55:21] [Music]
[1:55:24] are you with me we enjoy we enjoy the
[1:55:28] ministry the fifo
[1:55:29] ministry and listen god
[1:55:33] called preachers to preach not to play
[1:55:36] tapes
[1:55:36] to call them to preach
[1:55:41] one morning because god has gifted me
[1:55:43] the way that he's gifted me
[1:55:46] you know we we have evidence of it in
[1:55:48] the hundreds of times now
[1:55:51] and so i i'm not guessing at it i go by
[1:55:53] the atmosphere that's with it
[1:55:57] but i dreamed a dream
[1:56:01] and i dreamed that we were a couple
[1:56:04] things would happen
[1:56:06] and i'm going to go over time now so you
[1:56:08] just you just hang right with me
[1:56:10] there was two parts of the dream that we
[1:56:13] were together
[1:56:15] brother temperant brother donnie reagan
[1:56:18] myself
[1:56:20] and brother ed biskell was going to be
[1:56:22] in the same meeting
[1:56:29] and we would be standing getting our
[1:56:31] pictures together
[1:56:33] and saying this is a vision become real
[1:56:38] well brother donny and brother tim
[1:56:41] and myself and brother bischo was
[1:56:43] scheduled to be in switzerland
[1:56:46] that year but satan
[1:56:51] when he sees these things happen
[1:56:54] he tries to block the visitation
[1:56:57] now i'm going to preach here and this is
[1:56:58] an important part he tries to block
[1:57:01] because the word he can't stop
[1:57:04] but if you can get your eyes on the
[1:57:06] circumstances
[1:57:08] he can block he tried to do that with
[1:57:10] sarah and abraham
[1:57:12] and so and so brother bisco could not
[1:57:14] make the meeting
[1:57:16] only and there and they watch
[1:57:19] only in the last couple of weeks did he
[1:57:22] make the decision i'll go
[1:57:25] he didn't hardly have enough strength to
[1:57:27] be in the meeting
[1:57:28] but he came to the meeting at the end of
[1:57:30] it we're all standing there
[1:57:34] and we're standing before this great big
[1:57:36] window and we're all standing locked
[1:57:38] arm and arm we got the picture somewhere
[1:57:41] because the vision had to be fulfilled
[1:57:47] the second part of that that that dream
[1:57:50] vision whatever you want to call it
[1:57:51] there
[1:57:52] that dream i see a a pretty large
[1:57:56] gathering and brother timothy pruitt

[2:00:34] satan was taking another jab at a man
[2:00:37] that was in a vision that was going to
[2:00:38] have a baby

[2:01:18] fish sandwich
[2:01:22] us old-timers we blame everything on
[2:01:24] what we ate
[2:01:33] and my mother would have a heart attack
[2:01:36] that would continue going

[2:02:41] to me
[2:02:43] and he said well you know i got a lot to
[2:02:45] do in the morning
[2:02:47] and he just said it like that you know a
[2:02:49] lot of times that's what we do
[2:02:52] we don't understand the situation you

[2:02:58] treadmill i was preaching in this suit
[2:03:02] and this yellow this gold tie don't you
[2:03:05] know when i went to my closet i went and
[2:03:07] pulled it out
[2:03:10] when you say well that's just that's
[2:03:11] just nonsense brother ron well you see
[2:03:13] before i walked out of here
[2:03:14] when my sugar was dropping out the
[2:03:16] bottom i knew satan was trying to stop
[2:03:18] what's getting ready to come forth
[2:03:20] [Music]
[2:03:22] and he's no match for my god
[2:03:28] [Applause]
[2:03:36] and on my way i have a conversation with
[2:03:39] brother tim
[2:03:40] and brother tim pruitt says brother ron
[2:03:43] your dream
[2:03:44] is getting ready to be fulfilled
[2:03:47] brother david i've never told you this
[2:03:50] but he said
[2:03:51] god's going to raise davey up
[2:03:55] and you were in horrible shape he's
[2:03:58] going to raise
[2:03:59] davey up but he's going to raise your
[2:04:01] mother
[2:04:02] and give her a new body
[2:04:07] don't you know that was very difficult
[2:04:09] to hear
[2:04:10] that's right amen but that's the
[2:04:13] greatest miracle
[2:04:14] that my god could do for my mom
[2:04:18] is to raise her up and as i walked in
[2:04:22] and
[2:04:22] andrew and i walked in and we're we're
[2:04:24] standing there
[2:04:26] and the doctors have already practiced
[2:04:28] that she's getting ready to go she's
[2:04:29] you know she's giving us our last wishes
[2:04:32] and i walk in and i have a conversation
[2:04:34] with mom she's as clear
[2:04:35] and steady as i am right now and when
[2:04:38] and when
[2:04:39] and when she spoke to us and how much
[2:04:41] she loved us and those things
[2:04:43] am i telling the truth those things then
[2:04:45] the doctor came
[2:04:46] and told me the situation he walks over
[2:04:49] and tells
[2:04:49] talks to mom and he talks to her very
[2:04:52] quietly
[2:04:53] he has an incredible bedside manner and
[2:04:55] he begins to tell her the situation
[2:04:58] she said i'm ready to go and in that
[2:05:01] second
[2:05:02] the light the light switch went gone
[2:05:07] hollywood can't write it like that
[2:05:10] well you don't understand death is a
[2:05:12] christian's friend
