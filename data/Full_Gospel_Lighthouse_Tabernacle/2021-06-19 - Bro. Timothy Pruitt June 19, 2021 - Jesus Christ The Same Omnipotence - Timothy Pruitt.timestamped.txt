[58:48] spirit

[58:51] the supernatural
[58:53] and what we're seeing right now is an
[58:55] attack against the supernatural
[58:58] and so you know we have been brought
[59:00] through though through the fire of
[59:01] adversity
[59:03] and i want to just take a moment to say
[59:05] how much i appreciate you as a
[59:06] congregation

[59:35] we're not going to turn around we're
[59:37] going to go forward
[59:40] amen and i would like to just take a
[59:42] moment to share some notes
[59:43] as you know the story of uh just what
[59:47] 2007 when he was in that fire and we've
[59:49] we've told that
[59:50] quite a bit and it's a wonderful
[59:52] testimony and it still
[59:54] is true yet today of how god moved on
[59:57] the scene god would very
[59:59] directly orchestrate brother tim to come
[1:00:03] at a certain moment in a certain time to
[1:00:05] be here
[1:00:06] to minister to you brother ron was in
[1:00:08] the hospital
[1:00:10] but ron had been even looking very very
[1:00:12] dim and very dark
[1:00:14] and a dark place in the dark time but he
[1:00:16] would get up and he would preach the
[1:00:18] sermon on god will have a testimony
[1:00:20] and we have shared that testimony around
[1:00:23] the world of god's healing power
[1:00:25] and god's healing grace now as
[1:00:28] it would be that brother tim couldn't be
[1:00:30] here today
[1:00:31] but i'm here and i'm not here as timothy
[1:00:35] pruitt i'm here as a son of god
[1:00:38] bought by the blood of jesus christ to
[1:00:41] fill with the holy ghost an adopted
[1:00:43] son of god who knows his position and
[1:00:45] knows his place
[1:00:46] you know and i'd like to share some
[1:00:48] things of even a year ago
[1:00:50] as brother tim would come here as we
[1:00:52] first heard the news of brother ron's
[1:00:54] diagnosis and i want to share some of
[1:00:56] these things
[1:00:57] maybe a little personal but i feel like
[1:00:59] it's a time to do this
[1:01:02] it says this is brother tim as he would
[1:01:04] write these things down as he returned
[1:01:05] from the trip
[1:01:06] just over a year ago today we arrived in
[1:01:09] charlottesville virginia and brother ron
[1:01:11] sister connie brother matthew was there
[1:01:13] to meet us
[1:01:14] it was a very emotional time his brother
[1:01:16] ron sobbed and wept on my shoulder
[1:01:19] it was like we were there alone as
[1:01:21] hundreds of people walked by we are
[1:01:24] oblivious to anyone around
[1:01:26] he had prayed that morning saying god i
[1:01:29] need a boost
[1:01:30] we went from there to his home where
[1:01:32] brother donnie and sister carol reagan
[1:01:34] were waiting inside brother ron
[1:01:36] was not going to wait for another day
[1:01:38] for prayer he wanted prayer right now
[1:01:41] he was unlike pharaoh who wanted one
[1:01:43] more night with the frogs
[1:01:45] so brother donnie and i began to talk of
[1:01:47] divine healing and deliverances and how
[1:01:49] god had delivered others who were dying
[1:01:52] gary stanky brother ron himself when he
[1:01:55] was dying from the burns and that it was
[1:01:57] the will of god to be healed
[1:01:59] amen and the ladies were in the
[1:02:01] adjoining room and they come in as we
[1:02:02] were about to pray and the holy spirit
[1:02:04] came down and anointed us and we prayed
[1:02:08] and we cursed that demon of cancer and
[1:02:11] for his immune system to be activated to
[1:02:14] seek
[1:02:14] and destroy this cancer and i'm here to
[1:02:17] remind that
[1:02:18] devil he's still cursed
[1:02:22] amen
[1:02:30] brother donnie began interceding in the
[1:02:32] spirit as tongues from the heavenly
[1:02:34] languages began to flow from his mouth
[1:02:36] we were charged by the holy ghost and
[1:02:38] demanded that evil spirit of cancer to
[1:02:40] leave his body
[1:02:42] it was a powerful and anointed moment
[1:02:45] i would preach on saturday night on who
[1:02:48] hath believed our report
[1:02:50] on sunday night as our on our redemptive
[1:02:52] rights
[1:02:53] on that saturday night we received a
[1:02:55] testimony that meeting
[1:02:57] that i was ministering to japanese and
[1:02:59] didn't know it
[1:03:00] here's a testimony doctor you as was

[1:03:26] as i taught three classes i had during
[1:03:29] my graduate
[1:03:30] studies he's a philosopher and always
[1:03:32] shared you must have scientific evidence
[1:03:34] to prove anything the dissertation for
[1:03:37] english literature had already been
[1:03:39] accepted and i was very thankful
[1:03:41] we had a year in review on monday and
[1:03:42] tuesday i shared that contradictory to
[1:03:45] many opinions
[1:03:46] the supernatural occurred several times
[1:03:48] in history
[1:03:49] without scientific understanding i used
[1:03:52] several examples in the bible knowing
[1:03:54] the art regardless of scientific proof
[1:03:56] it rains 40 days and nights and god shut
[1:03:59] the door
[1:04:00] not noah another example was joshua and
[1:04:02] the sun standing still and the question
[1:04:04] was asked
[1:04:05] how in scientific research says there
[1:04:07] had to be movement
[1:04:08] i started i don't know how god did it i
[1:04:10] just know it happened
[1:04:12] before leaving the campus i shared
[1:04:16] i would be at jmu and visiting special
[1:04:18] friends in the church family in elkton
[1:04:20] i shared the youtube link and expressed
[1:04:22] you could check out the link
[1:04:24] you'll be blessed and encouraged last
[1:04:25] night during the service my phone kept
[1:04:27] vibrating
[1:04:28] i knew i had to be urgent for my family
[1:04:31] i knew because i
[1:04:32] knew i was at church and i checked it
[1:04:34] and it was dr you
[1:04:36] he had decided to check out the youtube
[1:04:40] link and heard brother pruch's comment
[1:04:42] about joshua and the son standing still
[1:04:44] he shared he was so overwhelmed by a
[1:04:46] presence that came into his room
[1:04:48] he immediately gave his heart to the
[1:04:50] lord he was thankful that the lord
[1:04:52] understood him as he had never prayed he
[1:04:54] asked me what should i do next
[1:04:56] i replied be baptized in the name of the
[1:04:58] lord jesus christ
[1:05:00] he quickly said he knew someone who did
[1:05:02] that so thankful to share this good news
[1:05:04] that we're and we're looking for the
[1:05:06] last one brother tim would write
[1:05:08] he said as you know i was supposed to be
[1:05:09] leaving to minister
[1:05:11] in japan but god had other plans and
[1:05:13] sent me on a mission
[1:05:14] and while here god saved a japanese
[1:05:16] professor
[1:05:17] this is an incredible miracle but since
[1:05:20] hearing the news on brother ron i've
[1:05:22] been praying earnestly for a visitation
[1:05:24] from the lord
[1:05:25] via a dream or a vision or his voice or
[1:05:28] any way he wanted to
[1:05:30] i felt as if i was like joshua looking
[1:05:32] at the walls of jericho
[1:05:34] trying to find a way to get through the
[1:05:36] big walls in order to conquer the enemy
[1:05:39] sunday night i had a very vivid dream i
[1:05:41] saw young but matured buzzards
[1:05:43] that had left the nests and had not yet
[1:05:45] learned to fly
[1:05:46] there were about 12 and i was feeding
[1:05:48] them to pigs monday i had a day of
[1:05:50] fellowship and preached all day to
[1:05:52] brother ron on the
[1:05:53] about the promises of healing on tuesday
[1:05:56] morning we would go to the hospital and
[1:05:58] find news of the treatments and plans
[1:06:00] then i'm to fly out for home at 2 40 in
[1:06:02] the middle of the night
[1:06:04] i had an experience of waking up and i
[1:06:06] thought i was singing the song
[1:06:08] we shall see miracles when i got up for
[1:06:11] coffee i was greeted by sister connie as
[1:06:13] i poured the water into the coffee pot
[1:06:15] she asked how our night was and i said
[1:06:18] find fine but if it's any consolation to
[1:06:20] you
[1:06:21] i woke up during the night singing the
[1:06:23] song we shall see miracles
[1:06:26] she began crying and said brother tim
[1:06:27] brother ron couldn't sleep and i woke up
[1:06:29] at 2 30
[1:06:30] and was singing the song we shall see
[1:06:33] miracles
[1:06:34] on the way to the doctor to discuss the
[1:06:36] cancer and plans i suddenly remembered
[1:06:38] my dream
[1:06:39] and it came to me that brother branham
[1:06:41] told that buzzards
[1:06:42] represented cancers and disease and
[1:06:45] afflictions it says a cancer
[1:06:47] in the spiritual he's a devil but in the
[1:06:49] natural he types a scavenger
[1:06:51] a buzzard he eats dead things i was
[1:06:54] puzzled by what pigs meant and i scanned
[1:06:56] over 150 quotes on pigs and couldn't
[1:06:58] find a clue
[1:06:59] in the sermons but when the doctor was
[1:07:01] talking about treatment using
[1:07:03] immunotherapy i did an internet search
[1:07:05] on cancer
[1:07:06] and immunotherapy and pigs and found
[1:07:08] that they developed
[1:07:09] the immunotherapy using small pigs like
[1:07:12] i saw in the dream
[1:07:14] there was about 12 of them and i fed
[1:07:16] them to the pigs one by one
[1:07:18] and i could see them chewing them up
[1:07:20] ripping
[1:07:21] apart the guts of the buzzards
[1:07:24] as i fed them you know it would be
[1:07:28] last year brother ron would feel to come
[1:07:30] to louisiana to be prayed for
[1:07:33] and i spoke to him and his sons on the
[1:07:36] phone just a week prior
[1:07:38] to him coming and he said now you watch
[1:07:40] satan
[1:07:41] is going to try to block it in a few
[1:07:44] days my mom sister karen would have her
[1:07:46] third brain bleed it would be
[1:07:48] so bad that she would need surgery it
[1:07:50] would be so bad that the doctors gave
[1:07:52] her no hope
[1:07:54] but she's still here
[1:08:05] we felt for brother ron to come anyways
[1:08:08] and
[1:08:08] he came and we would begin to have
[1:08:10] prayer meetings in the little cabin on
[1:08:12] the lake
[1:08:13] and that cabin god would come down and
[1:08:15] he would meet three
[1:08:16] boys two of them my sons and one of them
[1:08:19] here brother adam
[1:08:20] would have an experience with god
[1:08:22] brother ron would receive in that
[1:08:24] moment's supernatural strength to go
[1:08:26] home
[1:08:27] and continue now for another year and
[1:08:30] now a year later satan has once again
[1:08:32] tried
[1:08:32] tried to block a visitation
[1:08:35] my mom has again been attacked by
[1:08:37] confusion and memory loss
[1:08:40] but our god is awesome

[1:10:48] how many can say god is good
[1:11:02] also revelations 1 and verse 10.
[1:11:07] hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 we ought
[1:11:10] to know this by heart
[1:11:12] brother brandon would make this the
[1:11:14] theme of his ministry
[1:11:16] amen jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:11:20] today and forever amen let's just read
[1:11:23] that together
[1:11:24] jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:11:27] today and forever revelations 1 and
[1:11:30] verse 10
[1:11:32] says i was in the spirit on the lord's
[1:11:34] day and heard behind me a great voice as
[1:11:37] of a trumpet saying
[1:11:38] i am alpha and omega the first and the
[1:11:41] last
[1:11:42] what thou see us right in the book and
[1:11:44] send it unto the seven churches which
[1:11:46] are in asia verse 12
[1:11:48] and i turned to see the voices spake
[1:11:50] with me and being turned
[1:11:51] i saw seven golden candle sticks and the
[1:11:55] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[1:11:57] under the sun a man
[1:11:58] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[1:12:01] and gird about with
[1:12:02] the paps with a golden girdle and the
[1:12:04] head
[1:12:05] his head and his hair hairs were like
[1:12:08] white were white like wool and
[1:12:09] as white as snoke and his eyes were as a
[1:12:12] flame of fire
[1:12:14] and his feet like undefined brass and as
[1:12:17] they burned
[1:12:17] up in a furnace and his voice was the
[1:12:19] sound of many waters and he had in his
[1:12:22] right hand
[1:12:23] seven stars and out of his mouth when a
[1:12:25] sharp two-edged sword
[1:12:27] and his countenance was as the sun
[1:12:29] shineth in his strength
[1:12:31] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[1:12:33] dead
[1:12:34] and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:12:36] saying unto me fear not
[1:12:38] i am the first and the last i am he that
[1:12:42] liveth
[1:12:42] and was dead and behold i am alive
[1:12:45] forevermore
[1:12:47] amen and have the keys of hell
[1:12:50] and of death amen god bless you can be
[1:12:54] seated
[1:12:57] i'd like to speak to you on jesus christ
[1:13:00] the same
[1:13:01] omnipotence omnipotence as we would know
[1:13:05] the word means
[1:13:06] all-powerful there's nothing greater
[1:13:09] there's nothing higher
[1:13:10] and then omnipotence there's nothing
[1:13:12] that you can add to there's nothing that
[1:13:14] you could
[1:13:14] make it any greater it is all-powerful
[1:13:17] this is who god
[1:13:18] is this is who god is in this day and
[1:13:20] this hour that we live
[1:13:21] in now i'm very thankful that we can
[1:13:24] have a scripture that would be placed in
[1:13:25] the bible
[1:13:26] that would give us confidence tonight to
[1:13:28] stand upon that says he is the same
[1:13:31] yesterday today and forever so if you
[1:13:34] want to know who god is today you can go
[1:13:37] back and see what he was yesterday
[1:13:39] amen that's why it's written for us to
[1:13:41] look back upon because we can look at
[1:13:43] him
[1:13:43] and we can see how he judged the enemy
[1:13:45] we can see how he fought against the
[1:13:47] enemy
[1:13:48] we can see how he came against the
[1:13:49] spirits and all the things that went on
[1:13:52] and we know that what he was in the old
[1:13:54] testament
[1:13:55] he was in the new testament amen the
[1:13:57] jehovah of the old is the jesus
[1:14:00] of the new and jesus would show very
[1:14:02] quickly who he was and
[1:14:04] he would show that he had dominion he
[1:14:06] had power
[1:14:07] over every spirit over every demon of
[1:14:10] hell over everything that would try to
[1:14:12] come against him
[1:14:13] amen and so when an omnipotence begins
[1:14:16] to move
[1:14:16] there's nothing else that can there's
[1:14:18] nothing that can stop it because it is
[1:14:20] the greatest power
[1:14:21] it's the greatest voice it's the
[1:14:23] greatest the highest authority
[1:14:25] there's nothing greater than omnipotence
[1:14:27] and god
[1:14:28] has showed himself over and over to be a
[1:14:30] great god
[1:14:32] amen greater than the word that we can
[1:14:34] even describe him in you know god is so
[1:14:36] wonderful and so great
[1:14:37] and sometimes it's so hard to understand
[1:14:39] as a finite or a human being
[1:14:42] just how great and how wonderful he is
[1:14:44] and i'm so thankful to know that he's
[1:14:46] not somewhere up in the heavens today
[1:14:48] and you know and he's moved somewhere
[1:14:50] and he's off and
[1:14:51] you know doing something else but he is
[1:14:53] very present he is right here in our
[1:14:55] midst
[1:14:56] he is right here touching our hearts
[1:14:58] he's been orchestrating as we spoke
[1:15:00] about this whole week and things that
[1:15:01] have went all
[1:15:02] amen god has been on the scene already
[1:15:06] you know i mean there has a song would
[1:15:07] say even when i don't see him working
[1:15:09] even when i don't feel him working
[1:15:11] he's still working amen just because you
[1:15:14] hadn't seen him just because you hadn't
[1:15:16] felt him
[1:15:16] just because you may not realize he's
[1:15:18] around you
[1:15:20] god is on the scene god is on the throne
[1:15:23] amen
[1:15:24] god is working amen he would he would
[1:15:26] make it very clearly in this scripture
[1:15:28] as we read
[1:15:29] that he is in the age that we are living
[1:15:31] in
[1:15:32] as he was in the first age of second
[1:15:34] third fourth fifth sixth
[1:15:36] all the way down to our age he is still
[1:15:38] here among us
[1:15:39] he's still working miracles he's still
[1:15:42] healing he's still delivering
[1:15:44] he's still doing all of these things
[1:15:45] amen as we read here it says
[1:15:48] it says it's he begins to describe who
[1:15:51] he is here in revelations
[1:15:52] and brother branham would pick this up
[1:15:54] and he says see he said he that
[1:15:56] walketh in the midst of the golden
[1:15:58] candlesticks
[1:15:59] this is he of whom it is said this same
[1:16:02] jesus
[1:16:03] is both lord and christ there he is of
[1:16:06] the one and only
[1:16:07] lord god almighty beside him there is no
[1:16:10] other
[1:16:10] there he is the savior there he is the
[1:16:13] healer
[1:16:14] there he is a deliverer there he is the
[1:16:17] satisfier
[1:16:18] there he is everything that we have need
[1:16:20] of and he's walking
[1:16:21] in our midst hallelujah
[1:16:25] amen the seven golden candlesticks
[1:16:27] represented the seven church ages
[1:16:29] and he is in our midst to every believer
[1:16:32] he is jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:16:36] today and forever
[1:16:37] what he was in the first age he is in
[1:16:40] all ages
[1:16:41] what he did once he's still doing and
[1:16:44] we'll keep on doing
[1:16:45] he said but you notice jesus is walking
[1:16:48] along
[1:16:48] in the midst of the church there is no
[1:16:50] one else with him neither can there be
[1:16:53] for he alone has brought her salvation
[1:16:56] he alone has
[1:16:56] purchased her with his own blood he
[1:16:59] alone is her lord
[1:17:00] he alone is her master and she will give
[1:17:03] him
[1:17:04] all the glory she will give him all the
[1:17:06] honor
[1:17:07] and he will not share it with another
[1:17:09] notice there was no pope with him
[1:17:11] there was no mother with him there was
[1:17:13] no archbishop with him
[1:17:15] there was no prophet with him it was
[1:17:17] jesus christ
[1:17:18] and jesus christ alone
[1:17:20] [Applause]
[1:17:22] hallelujah amen he does not speak and
[1:17:24] turn to the father for he is the father
[1:17:26] he does not turn and give orders to the
[1:17:28] holy ghost for he
[1:17:30] is god the eternal spirit and in his
[1:17:32] life is flowing
[1:17:33] and pulsating in the church and has
[1:17:36] given her life
[1:17:37] and without him there would be no life
[1:17:39] for salvation
[1:17:40] is of the lord there was no one with him
[1:17:43] when he tried the fierceness of the
[1:17:45] wrath of the fiery furnace
[1:17:46] it was not another but it was him who
[1:17:48] hung on the cross
[1:17:50] it was him who gave his blood he is the
[1:17:52] author
[1:17:53] he is the finisher of our faith well i
[1:17:56] love that tonight
[1:17:57] he who started the work in you will
[1:18:00] finish the working year
[1:18:01] amen he didn't start you on the journey
[1:18:04] to bring you halfway
[1:18:05] and to drop you off somewhere and say
[1:18:07] you're on by yourself he said but i am
[1:18:10] the author
[1:18:10] and i am the finisher oh no
[1:18:14] what a finisher he is
[1:18:18] hallelujah he is the alpha he is the
[1:18:20] omega
[1:18:21] we are espoused to him and not another
[1:18:24] we don't belong to a church we belong to
[1:18:26] him
[1:18:27] we don't belong to a law we belong to
[1:18:29] him we don't belong to creeds and dogmas
[1:18:32] and constitutions we belong to jesus
[1:18:35] and jesus alone walks in the midst of
[1:18:38] his church
[1:18:38] it is god in her willing to do in his
[1:18:41] own good pleasure
[1:18:42] never forget that you only have one
[1:18:46] relationship to god
[1:18:47] and god has only one relationship to you
[1:18:50] it is jesus christ
[1:18:52] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:18:55] [Applause]
[1:18:57] hallelujah omnipotence there he is with
[1:19:00] the seven stars
[1:19:01] in his right hand in the right hand and
[1:19:04] then that arm signifies the power
[1:19:06] and the authority of almighty god and if
[1:19:09] we did not witness it in this day
[1:19:11] as that star would begin to shine in his
[1:19:13] in his hand
[1:19:15] listen i want you to understand that
[1:19:16] star that messenger that spoke
[1:19:19] did not come on his own accord he was in
[1:19:21] the
[1:19:22] hand of the one walking in the
[1:19:24] candidates of the candlesticks
[1:19:26] he was walking in the power and the
[1:19:28] authority of god
[1:19:29] brother would say over and over i cannot
[1:19:31] do this on my own
[1:19:33] i cannot do one thing on my own william
[1:19:35] branham has no power
[1:19:37] but he when he comes
[1:19:39] [Applause]
[1:19:40] hallelujah oh my
[1:19:43] in that right hand of power are those
[1:19:46] seven stars of the seven church age
[1:19:48] messengers
[1:19:49] this signifies that the very power and
[1:19:51] authority of god
[1:19:53] are about behind the messengers of every
[1:19:56] age
[1:19:56] they go forth in fire and power the holy
[1:19:59] ghost with the word
[1:20:00] they are stars because they reflect
[1:20:02] light the light they reflect
[1:20:05] is not their own light it is his life
[1:20:10] amen that's why we don't worship a
[1:20:12] prophet
[1:20:13] that's not why it's why we don't lift
[1:20:15] him up to a place he becomes our
[1:20:17] advocate or he becomes our intercessor
[1:20:19] or he becomes all that's not who he was
[1:20:23] that's who jesus is hallelujah
[1:20:28] matthew 28 and verse 18 will say jesus
[1:20:30] came and spake in them saying
[1:20:32] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[1:20:35] earth
[1:20:36] all power that's why he would be able to
[1:20:39] speak the words
[1:20:40] i'm the lord god that heals all thy
[1:20:42] diseases
[1:20:43] because he's omnipotent otherwise he
[1:20:46] couldn't say all
[1:20:47] because he didn't have all power or all
[1:20:49] authority
[1:20:54] i don't know i'm glad he put it like
[1:20:55] that i'm glad he went ahead and wrote it
[1:20:57] right there in the word
[1:20:58] i'm the lord god that heals all thy
[1:21:01] diseases
[1:21:03] amen so it doesn't matter what you face
[1:21:05] in life it goes in all it doesn't matter
[1:21:07] what kind of sickness you come upon the
[1:21:09] devil's been coming up with new ones and
[1:21:11] new ones and new ones
[1:21:12] it still goes in awe it still fits in
[1:21:16] all
[1:21:17] he can come up with a hundred more
[1:21:18] different kind of sicknesses and a
[1:21:20] couple hundred more
[1:21:21] other kind of things that come against
[1:21:23] you but it still
[1:21:24] goes in all i'm the lord god that heals
[1:21:27] all
[1:21:28] [Applause]
[1:21:29] all power it's been given unto me all
[1:21:32] authority
[1:21:33] has been given unto me
[1:21:38] so these messengers were full of the
[1:21:40] holy ghost and faith on fire with the
[1:21:42] fire of god
[1:21:43] holding the word of truth and i'm
[1:21:45] thankful for them amen
[1:21:47] and there he stands to back them up and
[1:21:49] think of it
[1:21:50] not one believer of any age needs to say
[1:21:53] in his heart or cry in his heart
[1:21:54] oh i wish i would have been in the first
[1:21:56] stage or i wish i'd have been there
[1:21:58] there's no need to look back
[1:22:00] look up behold him who is even now
[1:22:04] walking in the midst of the churches
[1:22:06] behold him
[1:22:07] who even now is the same yesterday today
[1:22:10] and forever
[1:22:10] behold him who never changes either in
[1:22:13] essence or in his ways
[1:22:16] i'm thankful to serve a god who don't
[1:22:18] change
[1:22:19] [Applause]
[1:22:20] oh hallelujah i'm thankful he's not some
[1:22:23] fickle man
[1:22:24] that one day loves me and the next day
[1:22:26] hates me one day he's got a good thought
[1:22:28] about me the next day he's got a bad
[1:22:29] thought about me
[1:22:30] but god thought of me at the beginning
[1:22:32] and he has a shame thought today
[1:22:38] of you who's been lying to and he's
[1:22:39] telling you i the devil
[1:22:41] devil's been saying this this message is
[1:22:43] not for you and you don't belong to you
[1:22:45] it's for your mama it's for your daddy
[1:22:47] it's for somebody else that's a lie the
[1:22:50] devil
[1:22:52] let me just say it like this when the
[1:22:53] devil is lying why don't when he's
[1:22:55] speaking he's lying right
[1:22:56] so if the devil is lying and he always
[1:22:59] hears why don't you just take exactly
[1:23:01] opposite of what he says
[1:23:03] if he says the message ain't for you
[1:23:06] that means the message is for you
[1:23:08] if he says you're not healed that means
[1:23:09] you are healed if he says you're not
[1:23:11] delivered that means you are delivered
[1:23:15] if he says you can't be free that means
[1:23:17] you are afraid
[1:23:22] hallelujah he is a sustainer he is a
[1:23:26] life-giver
[1:23:27] of all things in the church
[1:23:33] he who walketh in the midst of the seven
[1:23:35] golden candlesticks
[1:23:36] how meaningful are these words when
[1:23:38] viewed in the light of the scripture
[1:23:40] which describes him as christ our life
[1:23:43] for in christ indeed is the life of the
[1:23:46] church she has no other life
[1:23:48] without him she's simply a religious
[1:23:50] society
[1:23:52] she's a club she's a meaningless
[1:23:54] gathering of people
[1:23:58] a corpse bejeweled and dressed is still
[1:24:01] a corpse
[1:24:03] they could have the looks of a church
[1:24:05] they could have the outside or
[1:24:06] a look and appearance of a church but
[1:24:09] the spirit of god is not there
[1:24:11] they are a corpse
[1:24:15] dead amen so the church no matter what
[1:24:17] her programs are
[1:24:18] what her efforts might achieve without
[1:24:20] christ she's a corpse
[1:24:22] but with him in the midst oh hallelujah
[1:24:25] with him motivating her
[1:24:26] with him becoming the wonderment of his
[1:24:28] all his body the fullness of him feeling
[1:24:31] all in all
[1:24:32] in this very hour he's walking in the
[1:24:34] midst
[1:24:40] and as he walks in this age will be
[1:24:43] exactly
[1:24:43] as he walked in the first age
[1:24:47] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:24:49] and forever without christ
[1:24:52] you're just a corpse without him we're
[1:24:54] nothing
[1:24:55] [Music]
[1:24:57] but listen let me tell you he's not just
[1:24:59] standing there as a complacent onlooker
[1:25:03] he said where two or three are gathered
[1:25:05] in my name there i will be
[1:25:09] and not only in their myths as a
[1:25:10] complacent onlooker or just a recording
[1:25:13] angel
[1:25:14] but he's there expressing himself
[1:25:17] that he is the life of your of the
[1:25:19] church he is a sustainer
[1:25:21] he's a giver of life
[1:25:26] christ is here tonight to take on human
[1:25:29] battles
[1:25:32] christ is here tonight to take on cancer
[1:25:35] and
[1:25:35] sugar problems christ is here tonight to
[1:25:38] take on depression and
[1:25:40] anxiety and fears christ
[1:25:43] is here tonight to take on sin he's
[1:25:46] already paid the price for it all
[1:25:48] it's already done
[1:25:54] christ is here to defend you when you
[1:25:56] can't defend yourself
[1:25:58] he's here to lift you up when you can't
[1:25:59] lift yourself up
[1:26:01] he's here to boast you or to boost you
[1:26:03] to to bring you up into another round
[1:26:06] i listen let me just say it this way
[1:26:08] that devil does not have the final say
[1:26:10] over your life
[1:26:14] he has a voice and he's always speaking
[1:26:16] and he's always
[1:26:17] mind battles and every kind of thing
[1:26:19] listen you wouldn't believe the mind
[1:26:20] battles i've been through this week
[1:26:22] i had to keep casting down imaginations
[1:26:26] i said devil i'm not listening to you i
[1:26:28] got my eyes on the goal
[1:26:29] i got my eyes on a promise
[1:26:33] hallelujah amen we've all been how many

[1:26:44] a liar
[1:26:47] hallelujah and you take to captivity
[1:26:49] every thought
[1:26:50] that tries to exalt itself above the
[1:26:52] word of god

[1:27:34] amen that voice is speaking over your
[1:27:36] life it don't it's not the final voice
[1:27:38] but there is a voice in this place
[1:27:40] tonight
[1:27:42] and it is the force not of death
[1:27:46] it is the voice of resurrection

[1:27:55] that's the one who has the final say
[1:27:59] and he is your defender i'm going
[1:28:01] through some scriptures real quick
[1:28:02] i'm not going to take time to tell you

[1:28:05] follow just listen
[1:28:06] the lord is my strong defender he is the
[1:28:10] one who saved me how many can say that
[1:28:12] he is my god and i will praise him

[1:29:01] lord listen to this now he will run
[1:29:03] anyone
[1:29:04] who runs
[1:29:09] oh them blessed are the poor in spirit
[1:29:14] the devil's been after you amen he's
[1:29:17] been trying to come in
[1:29:18] against you unjustly i want you to
[1:29:20] understand there's a word
[1:29:22] that's coming on your defense that's
[1:29:25] standing between you and your enemy
[1:29:27] just as he stood between the children of
[1:29:29] israel and the
[1:29:30] egyptians a pillar of fire wouldn't
[1:29:32] stood between them
[1:29:34] that same pillar of fire is here tonight
[1:29:37] and he's standing between you and death
[1:29:39] he's standing between you and depression
[1:29:42] he's standing between you and hell
[1:29:45] he's standing against you between you
[1:29:47] and the lies somebody told against you
[1:29:49] he's standing between you and every kind
[1:29:51] of spirit
[1:29:55] the lord is your mighty defender
[1:29:59] your god is faithful
[1:30:03] i could just about have me a dancing
[1:30:04] spell on that because his word
[1:30:06] is true he would not put it in there
[1:30:11] unless he was telling the truth
[1:30:13] [Applause]
[1:30:14] a matter of fact he would come to the
[1:30:16] laodicean church age in revelation
[1:30:18] chapter 3
[1:30:19] and he would say unto the lao and to see
[1:30:21] in church aids right
[1:30:24] the faithful and true witness
[1:30:27] the amen of god
[1:30:28] [Applause]
[1:30:31] let him speak let's let the true witness
[1:30:35] speak tonight
[1:30:37] let's let the amen say something tonight
[1:30:42] amen he did it in this generation
[1:30:46] amen why would he put it there why would
[1:30:47] he say the amen because he came behind
[1:30:50] the prophet of god
[1:30:51] every service and he'd say amen
[1:30:55] brother branham would say if i've told
[1:30:56] the truth let him come
[1:31:01] he said he's a faithful and true witness
[1:31:06] so apparently what he told was the truth
[1:31:08] because he came
[1:31:10] and he would begin to discern the hearts
[1:31:12] and he would tell him your address is
[1:31:13] such and such
[1:31:14] you're going through this and you've
[1:31:16] been having this problem you got this
[1:31:17] situation
[1:31:18] you're near death but there's a light
[1:31:21] hanging over you
[1:31:24] why was that light there because it was
[1:31:26] defending them
[1:31:27] it was pushing back the cloud of
[1:31:29] darkness it was pushing back hell
[1:31:32] may that light fall upon you tonight
[1:31:35] that holy ghost is the defender that'll
[1:31:37] stand between you
[1:31:38] and death itself
[1:31:45] psalms 3 1 would say when the when when
[1:31:47] i hear
[1:31:48] when they would flee from absent lord
[1:31:50] how many are they increased that trouble
[1:31:52] me
[1:31:53] many are they that rise up against me
[1:31:55] many of them be the same my soul
[1:31:57] there's no help from him and god but
[1:32:00] thou o lord
[1:32:01] are shield for me my glory and the
[1:32:04] lifter up of my head
[1:32:06] i cried unto the lord with my voice and
[1:32:09] he heard me
[1:32:10] oh hallelujah maybe you've been crying
[1:32:13] he's heard your cry
[1:32:15] [Applause]
[1:32:16] it might be like daniel it might be 21
[1:32:18] days for the angel
[1:32:20] was able to get to him why because the
[1:32:22] prince of persia
[1:32:23] withstood him
[1:32:28] but i read in revelations where the
[1:32:31] dragon came
[1:32:32] and he prevailed not
[1:32:34] [Applause]
[1:32:35] because omnipotence is in the place
[1:32:38] when omnipotence comes the devil has to
[1:32:41] bow down
[1:32:42] and flee
[1:32:43] [Applause]
[1:32:49] he is the amen he is the final say
[1:32:53] he's the final say over your life
[1:32:57] oh omnipotence is these things saith the
[1:33:00] amen
[1:33:01] the faithful and true witness the amen
[1:33:04] has a voice
[1:33:06] therefore the amen has something to say
[1:33:09] and what he says is final but what your
[1:33:12] doctor says is not final
[1:33:15] but what he says is final but what the
[1:33:18] devil says is not final
[1:33:21] what he says is final but what
[1:33:23] depression says is not final
[1:33:26] what he says is final but what
[1:33:28] pornography says is not finally
[1:33:36] jesus has given us a description of
[1:33:39] himself
[1:33:40] in relation to this last age the days of
[1:33:43] grace are winding up
[1:33:44] he's looking from the first century
[1:33:46] right through the 20th told us all the
[1:33:48] things concerning this age before he
[1:33:50] reveals the characteristics of the last
[1:33:52] stage to us
[1:33:52] he gives one final look at himself this
[1:33:55] gracious supreme deity
[1:33:57] the capstone relates the revelation of
[1:33:59] himself
[1:34:00] thus saith the amen jesus is the
[1:34:04] amen jesus is so let it be of god
[1:34:08] amen stands for finality it stands for
[1:34:11] approval
[1:34:12] it stands for prevailing promise it
[1:34:14] stands for unchanging promise
[1:34:16] it stands for the seal of god the amen
[1:34:19] approves of you
[1:34:21] [Applause]
[1:34:24] therefore you don't have to seek others
[1:34:27] [Applause]
[1:34:28] [Music]
[1:34:30] approval
[1:34:33] you know i i was well you know they got
[1:34:36] this
[1:34:37] there's a thing called chosen out
[1:34:40] they borrowed that because we are the
[1:34:44] chosen
[1:34:46] but i thought it was a very unique
[1:34:48] moment in that place that really spoke
[1:34:49] to me
[1:34:50] you know they they portrayed matthew as
[1:34:53] being kind of a unique kind of guy and i
[1:34:54] don't know what kind of guy he was
[1:34:56] but you know i know there are people
[1:34:58] that are like matthew
[1:35:00] unique just to be honest every one of us
[1:35:04] is unique we got we all got our quirks
[1:35:09] we're going to slow down for just a
[1:35:10] minute we all got our quirks
[1:35:14] but philip came into the group and came
[1:35:17] john and sent him to jesus to follow him
[1:35:19] and
[1:35:19] he said and he comes into the group and
[1:35:22] he comes and begins to speak to matthew
[1:35:24] and he's drawn to matthew in this series
[1:35:25] and he
[1:35:26] begins to talk to him and matthew begins
[1:35:29] to express well i'm just not accepted
[1:35:31] and
[1:35:31] and i got all these issues and i think
[1:35:33] he's talking
[1:35:35] and philip tells him but what's
[1:35:38] important here is not what you are
[1:35:41] what's important is he chose you
[1:35:49] i didn't tell some of you young people
[1:35:51] he didn't put you in the family that
[1:35:53] you're in
[1:35:54] just by accident
[1:35:59] i think about it all the time he didn't
[1:36:01] put me here by accident
[1:36:03] i could have been born in any country in
[1:36:05] the world
[1:36:07] born any color born under any kind of
[1:36:09] language
[1:36:13] but he put me in a family of a preacher
[1:36:17] not just a preacher of of any kind of
[1:36:20] doctrine
[1:36:21] but a preacher of the message of the
[1:36:22] last day
[1:36:25] do you know what kind of odds that is
[1:36:29] do you know what kind of odds it is
[1:36:30] where you're at tonight
[1:36:34] why are you here because the amen said
[1:36:37] you would be
[1:36:38] [Applause]
[1:36:41] therefore when you realize he chose me
[1:36:44] i didn't choose myself god chose me
[1:36:48] i didn't even i didn't have one able to
[1:36:50] say i want to be in certain family in a
[1:36:51] certain
[1:36:52] state in a certain fashion a certain
[1:36:54] region i couldn't make that choice but
[1:36:56] he chose me
[1:36:57] and he put me there so i might be quirky
[1:37:00] i might have my own quirks in my own
[1:37:02] ways but god chose me that's what's
[1:37:05] important
[1:37:06] therefore when you can rest on his
[1:37:08] approval on his choosing
[1:37:10] you don't go out into the world young
[1:37:12] ladies and look for some other kind of
[1:37:14] approval
[1:37:14] you don't go out there boys and look for
[1:37:16] some other you have been chosen
[1:37:19] and approved by the amen
[1:37:23] you have been placed in the family
[1:37:25] you're placed here by the amen
[1:37:28] [Applause]
[1:37:32] god chose you that's all that matters
[1:37:35] [Applause]
[1:37:39] he said i want you he said i want you to
[1:37:40] watch something carefully see something
[1:37:42] really sweet and beautiful
[1:37:44] i said this in his end time revelation
[1:37:47] of himself
[1:37:48] when the day of grace closes the
[1:37:50] millennium comes shortly very
[1:37:51] very very shortly thereafter read with
[1:37:54] me in
[1:37:54] isaiah 65 and 16 that he who is blessed
[1:37:58] blessed himself and the earth shall be
[1:37:59] blessed shall bless himself with the god
[1:38:01] of truth and brother branham talks about
[1:38:03] the god of truth is the god of the amen
[1:38:06] and he ties it right in that the jehovah
[1:38:08] of the old
[1:38:09] is the jesus of the new amen he begins
[1:38:12] to talk about the amen
[1:38:13] he said see god of truth god of the amen
[1:38:16] god of amen he said what is it because
[1:38:19] it is
[1:38:20] it is god now coming in this time
[1:38:23] showing us us himself that who he was in
[1:38:26] the old testament
[1:38:27] he's still in the new testament and who
[1:38:29] he was in the old and the new testament
[1:38:31] he's still in our day
[1:38:35] oh amen because he said i am the god the
[1:38:37] amen
[1:38:38] amen it says see the new testament does
[1:38:40] not reveal another god
[1:38:42] or further revelation it is the one and
[1:38:44] same god
[1:38:45] christ did not come down and make
[1:38:47] himself known he did not come to reveal
[1:38:49] the son
[1:38:50] he came to reveal and make known the
[1:38:52] father he never talked about two gods he
[1:38:54] talked about one god
[1:38:55] and now in this last stage we come back
[1:38:57] to that capstone revelation
[1:38:59] which is the most important revelation
[1:39:01] of the godhead
[1:39:02] that jesus is god he is of he and the
[1:39:05] father are one
[1:39:06] there is one god and his name is the
[1:39:09] lord jesus christ
[1:39:10] he is the god of the amen he never
[1:39:12] changes
[1:39:13] what he does never change what he says
[1:39:16] it stands fast
[1:39:17] he does it and it's done forever
[1:39:19] hallelujah
[1:39:21] oh hallelujah none can take from it nor
[1:39:24] is he what he says or add to it so let
[1:39:27] it be
[1:39:27] a man so let it be aren't you glad we
[1:39:30] serve that kind of god
[1:39:31] you can know exactly where you are with
[1:39:34] him at any time
[1:39:35] in all time he is the amen god and he
[1:39:38] won't change
[1:39:39] these things saith the amen
[1:39:42] that means that whatever he says is
[1:39:45] final
[1:39:46] [Applause]
[1:39:48] what he says is final what he says
[1:39:52] is final not what you say or what
[1:39:55] somebody said about you
[1:39:56] or what the doctor said about you or
[1:39:58] what some test said about you
[1:40:00] what he says is finally
[1:40:08] hallelujah it means that whatever he
[1:40:09] said in the first stage and the second
[1:40:12] and all ages about his true church and
[1:40:14] about the
[1:40:15] false vine is exactly right and it won't
[1:40:18] change
[1:40:18] it means what he started in genesis
[1:40:20] he'll finish in revelations
[1:40:22] he has to for he is the amen so let it
[1:40:25] be
[1:40:26] and we can see again why the devil hates
[1:40:28] this
[1:40:30] because he knows when he speaks he's
[1:40:34] finished
[1:40:36] oh hallelujah these saints say the
[1:40:39] faithful
[1:40:40] and true witness he's faithful he
[1:40:42] watches over his word
[1:40:44] and he will bring his word to pass not
[1:40:46] one little bit of it will fall to the
[1:40:48] wayside not one jot not one tittle will
[1:40:51] go unfulfilled
[1:40:52] but he will fulfill every part and every
[1:40:55] place
[1:40:56] devils can scream devils can howl they
[1:40:58] can line every devil up
[1:41:00] but when the omnipotence speaks and the
[1:41:02] amen says that's finished
[1:41:04] it is over with it is done with
[1:41:08] and there ain't nothing the devil can do
[1:41:09] about it
[1:41:10] [Applause]
[1:41:12] hallelujah you remember when the amen
[1:41:14] spoke over your life
[1:41:15] you one time drugs had you the voice of
[1:41:18] hollywood had you
[1:41:19] the voice of all kind of spirits had you
[1:41:21] but the amen began to call
[1:41:23] and woo upon your life and begin to
[1:41:25] speak and all of a sudden the holy ghost
[1:41:27] fell into your heart
[1:41:28] what was it it is finished there's no
[1:41:32] more going back
[1:41:33] there's no more looking back i already
[1:41:35] got what i came for
[1:41:37] [Applause]
[1:41:44] he is the creator he is a sustainer
[1:41:47] i'm lifting him up tonight i'm lifting
[1:41:50] him up for a purpose
[1:41:53] for by him were all things created that
[1:41:56] in heaven that are in earth visible and
[1:41:58] invisible
[1:41:58] whether it be thrones or dominions or
[1:42:00] principalities or power

[1:45:35] he sent his comforter he's coming to
[1:45:38] spirit
[1:45:39] to move in his church just like he did
[1:45:42] in the first
[1:45:42] age
[1:45:48] brother brown we'll talk about is how
[1:45:49] you say talk about that vine
[1:45:51] he said if it ever produces another
[1:45:53] branch
[1:45:54] it'll be just like the first branch
[1:45:59] it'll be a continuation of the book of
[1:46:01] acts
[1:46:02] this is what we're seeing in our
[1:46:04] generation is a continuation of the book
[1:46:07] of acts
[1:46:12] my god what happened on the book of acts
[1:46:16] it was 120 that were gathered in the
[1:46:19] upper room
[1:46:20] they were getting all one mind in one
[1:46:22] accord beginning to think on the
[1:46:24] goodness of god and all the things they
[1:46:25] had witnessed and seen
[1:46:27] in this generation and all of a sudden a
[1:46:30] sound
[1:46:30] like a mighty russian wind began to blow
[1:46:33] through the building
[1:46:35] i say wind of god blow tonight
[1:46:40] and tongues of fire where a pillar of
[1:46:42] fire
[1:46:43] showed itself in their midst and tongues
[1:46:45] of fire began to fall upon all of those
[1:46:47] that was there
[1:46:48] they began to speak in other languages
[1:46:51] as a spirit gave utterance until what
[1:46:53] people thought they were drunk
[1:46:56] so what is this some kind of new wine he
[1:46:58] said this is not new wine it's only the
[1:47:00] third hour of the day
[1:47:01] but this is that that the prophet joel
[1:47:03] spoke about
[1:47:05] in the last days i pour out my spirit
[1:47:07] upon all flesh
[1:47:11] hallelujah those men that used to be
[1:47:14] cowards those men that used to fall back
[1:47:16] and wouldn't answer questions those men
[1:47:18] they used to be uh
[1:47:19] just backslidden as they could be and
[1:47:22] away from god would now stand with
[1:47:24] boldness
[1:47:25] begin to declare the mercies of almighty
[1:47:27] god to where three thousand would give
[1:47:29] their
[1:47:30] lives to jesus christ
[1:47:33] that's the book of acts that we're
[1:47:34] looking for amen live is being born into
[1:47:37] the kingdom of god
[1:47:39] it would be that those two men peter and
[1:47:42] john went down to the gate called
[1:47:43] beautiful
[1:47:44] and there said a lame man been sitting
[1:47:46] there begging of alms
[1:47:48] said silver and gold have i none he said
[1:47:51] we don't have it i don't have money i
[1:47:53] don't have it
[1:47:54] but such as i have give out to thee
[1:47:58] in the name of jesus rise up and walk
[1:48:04] and what happened the lame man began to
[1:48:06] jump to his feet
[1:48:07] and went leaping and praising god
[1:48:11] it was miracle after miracle sign after
[1:48:13] sign wander after wonder that was
[1:48:15] performed
[1:48:16] under the unction of the amen
[1:48:21] the spirit of god the absolute
[1:48:24] brother brown would preach from this he
[1:48:26] said it's the last words just the amen
[1:48:29] he said you see you hear people say
[1:48:31] absolutely that's it
[1:48:32] that's the last thing he said the
[1:48:34] absolute is unlimited
[1:48:37] there's nothing else that it's in its
[1:48:39] way it's the supreme
[1:48:41] it's the ultimate it's the it's it's
[1:48:43] reached us in
[1:48:44] it's the amen

[1:53:15] that girl never changed a bit i said all
[1:53:18] right norma
[1:53:19] you know i wouldn't have told you that
[1:53:21] now unless i had seen it
[1:53:22] and god can't lie i went out on
[1:53:26] out of the hospital got in my car about
[1:53:27] two hours from then
[1:53:29] the phone started ringing i come up from
[1:53:31] when i come up from mr woods down below
[1:53:33] it was her father he was on the phone he
[1:53:35] said brother branham i got to tell you
[1:53:37] something
[1:53:38] you ain't been gone 20 minutes until she
[1:53:40] came to herself just as normal
[1:53:42] she's been examined by the doctor and
[1:53:44] the whole staff we're taking her home in
[1:53:46] the morning
[1:53:46] [Music]
[1:53:48] morning is coming morning is coming
[1:53:53] hallelujah amen i believe in just a few
[1:53:56] moments
[1:53:57] that body's going to line up to the word
[1:53:59] of god
[1:54:01] doctors have done all they can do amen
[1:54:03] we prayed we believe
[1:54:04] but just in a moment is all it takes
[1:54:07] that body's going to line up to the word
[1:54:09] of god
[1:54:10] and cancer's going to flee sugar
[1:54:12] problems are going to flee
[1:54:14] every kind of thing that's come against
[1:54:16] his organs is going to turn
[1:54:17] loose in the name of jesus because
[1:54:20] it's not my word it's his word
[1:54:23] he said so i didn't say so god said it
[1:54:28] and if god said it the amen said it i
[1:54:31] can believe what he said
[1:54:32] because he's never wrong
[1:54:47] having an anchor for an absolute
[1:54:51] there's been a storm a bonus
[1:54:55] listen to brother ron's last two sermons
[1:54:58] praise him in the storm
[1:55:01] why could he praise him because that
[1:55:03] wave can only take him so far
[1:55:09] it can only do so much it only has so
[1:55:12] much power
[1:55:13] because there's an absolute hole
[1:55:16] it's an anchor not just a bottom of some
[1:55:19] bedrock in the bottom of an ocean
[1:55:21] but it's an anchor beyond the veil
[1:55:25] anchored into the blood of jesus christ
[1:55:28] and when those howling winds begin to
[1:55:30] blow and it gets real dark
[1:55:34] can i say something we're right at the
[1:55:37] moment
[1:55:39] jesus is going to step on the bridle of
[1:55:40] the boat
[1:55:49] what happens when he steps on the brow
[1:55:50] of the boat
[1:55:52] omnipotent speaks
[1:55:55] peace be still
[1:55:59] omnipotent steps on the side of the boat
[1:56:02] it says peace
[1:56:03] be still and the cancer and all of his
[1:56:07] war
[1:56:07] and and all of his raging and all of his
[1:56:11] anger
[1:56:12] gonna sink him i'm gonna take him out
[1:56:15] but a voice speaks
[1:56:19] it's jesus
[1:56:25] right now on the 701 proofville drive
[1:56:28] there's been a lot of storming going on
[1:56:31] he warned us it was going to happen
[1:56:33] storm's coming
[1:56:36] but he wouldn't have warned us unless he
[1:56:38] was going to be there to take care of us
[1:56:42] and i know without a without a doubt
[1:56:44] that we didn't go off without him
[1:56:47] [Applause]
[1:56:50] we're not in this journey without him
[1:56:52] but no he's with us in the boat
[1:56:56] i've witnessed him every service here i
[1:56:58] witnessed him moving in your midst
[1:57:00] there's no doubt we could tell of
[1:57:02] testimonies that happened right here in
[1:57:04] this moments
[1:57:05] while your brother was going through
[1:57:06] this storm miracles have been taking
[1:57:09] place signs and wonders have been
[1:57:11] showing
[1:57:11] why because jesus is in the boat
[1:57:21] can i say this tonight amen there's a
[1:57:24] little boy here that's about 16 18
[1:57:26] months old that hasn't walked
[1:57:28] but he's going to because jesus is in
[1:57:32] the boat
[1:57:33] and he's the same yesterday today and
[1:57:36] forever
[1:57:37] if he healed a lame man one time he
[1:57:39] could heal him again
[1:57:43] if he took bones it couldn't walk and
[1:57:45] three muscles they couldn't operate
[1:57:47] and he put such a power in him by the
[1:57:49] house speaking of the holy ghost
[1:57:51] silver and gold have i none but what i
[1:57:54] have
[1:57:54] give unto thee in the name of jesus
[1:57:57] christ

[1:58:31] end of that story
[1:58:32] he was holding that giant's head up
[1:58:36] and he was shouting the praises of
[1:58:38] almighty god
[1:58:39] because god had brought the victory in
[1:58:42] the hearts
[1:58:43] of the people of god and when they saw
[1:58:45] that head come up
[1:58:47] others said we can do it too
[1:58:50] hallelujah amen i believe that we're
[1:58:52] going to hold the head
[1:58:54] of this whole cancer up and the reflex
[1:58:56] of this brain bleed up

[2:01:40] oh god put a faith in our hearts to go
[2:01:43] down into the valley
[2:01:44] and grab that stone that's already there
[2:01:50] before david ever went to see goliath i
[2:01:53] was there in that place i walked down in
[2:01:54] that very same valley
[2:01:56] i walked down to that same very brutal
[2:01:57] very same brook
[2:01:59] i picked up some rocks oh yeah
[2:02:02] i got those rocks and you know what
[2:02:05] thought hit me
[2:02:06] that before david ever found goliath was
[2:02:08] going to be there
[2:02:09] before there ever was a goliath there
[2:02:12] was a rock prepared for his destruction
[2:02:17] before there ever was cancer
[2:02:19] there was a rock prepared for his
[2:02:21] destruction before there ever was
[2:02:23] depression
[2:02:24] brain bleed spirits of every kind
[2:02:26] there's a rock prepared for his disc
[2:02:28] all you got to do is walk down into the
[2:02:30] valley
[2:02:32] walk down into the place prepared this
[2:02:34] place was not prepared for your death
[2:02:36] this place was prepared for giants to
[2:02:38] fall this place was
[2:02:40] prepared for you to walk on water
[2:02:44] this place was prepared that god could
[2:02:47] come on the scene
[2:02:48] and change it in a moment and a
[2:02:50] twinkling of an eye
[2:02:56] oh the waves may be flowing maybe
[2:02:58] hitting against the whole boat but it's
[2:03:00] still holding
[2:03:01] it can only go so far because there's an
[2:03:04] anchor hole
[2:03:06] oh praise the lord you got just a few
[2:03:08] more minutes
[2:03:10] oh my let me get this right god has the
[2:03:13] final say
[2:03:18] that ought to put a rejoice in
[2:03:19] somebody's heart
[2:03:23] god has the final say we face situations
[2:03:27] that look permanent
[2:03:28] like they're never going to work out so
[2:03:30] therefore it's easy to get discouraged
[2:03:32] it's easy
[2:03:32] to accept that it was just meant to be
[2:03:35] but it's not over
[2:03:36] till god says it's over the medical
[2:03:39] medical report may not look good
[2:03:41] and that's sick but that sickness does
[2:03:43] not have the last words
[2:03:45] god has the final say
[2:03:48] people may be against you you may have
[2:03:51] opposition
[2:03:52] but people don't have the final say
[2:03:56] no disrespect but doctors lawyers
[2:03:59] bankers
[2:03:59] experts judges they may be good people
[2:04:02] but they're not on the throne
[2:04:04] god is on the throne and him being for
[2:04:06] you
[2:04:07] it's more than everybody being against
[2:04:09] you
[2:04:11] and god will not let you come to a
[2:04:13] problem that he can't get you out of
[2:04:16] [Applause]
[2:04:18] oh my he wouldn't let the three hebrew
[2:04:20] children be thrown in a fiery furnace
[2:04:22] he didn't know the fire was if he knew
[2:04:24] the didn't know the fire wasn't going to
[2:04:26] harm them
[2:04:27] king nebuchadnezzar thought he was in
[2:04:28] control he thought he had the final say
[2:04:31] that the fire would finish them off and
[2:04:33] that's what always has happened
[2:04:35] they've thrown them in there before and
[2:04:37] they died he threw them in there again
[2:04:39] and they died
[2:04:41] but these three said we ain't bending
[2:04:44] we ain't bowing
[2:04:48] but this time he wasn't dealing
[2:04:51] with ordinary people
[2:04:55] he was dealing with children of the most
[2:04:58] high god
[2:05:04] and they came out without the smell of
[2:05:07] smoke
[2:05:09] you know there's something about you
[2:05:11] that makes you unstoppable
[2:05:14] you have an advantage god has not only
[2:05:16] breathed life into you
[2:05:18] but he's put a hedge of protection
[2:05:19] around you nothing can touch you without
[2:05:22] his permission
[2:05:23] you're not at the mercy of bad breaks
[2:05:24] you're not at the mercy of sickness
[2:05:26] you're not the mercy of accidents
[2:05:29] are you brother davey not at the mercy
[2:05:33] of accidents
[2:05:34] not at the murder people may be against
[2:05:36] you none of that can stop who you
[2:05:38] are none of that can stop who you're
[2:05:40] going where you're going
[2:05:41] you're not going through life by
[2:05:42] yourself but god is behind the scenes
[2:05:45] orchestrating it all out for your good
[2:05:48] all things work together
[2:05:50] for the good to them that are the call
[2:05:52] according to his purpose
[2:05:56] first peter 3 says jesus has the last
[2:05:59] words
[2:06:00] on everything
[2:06:03] now you may be dealing with sickness the
[2:06:05] medical report says you're not going to
[2:06:07] make it
[2:06:07] that's one word but god has the last
[2:06:10] word
[2:06:12] a diagnosis is not a verdict
[2:06:20] it's not the final word but what is the
[2:06:24] final word
[2:06:25] i am the lord god that heals all thy
[2:06:28] diseases what is the final word is
[2:06:31] i am the resurrection and the life
[2:06:44] there were some couples there's a couple
[2:06:46] ladies one time that was
[2:06:47] all down and depressed their brother had
[2:06:50] died
[2:06:51] that sent off for their friend who
[2:06:54] they'd left everybody to follow
[2:06:56] and sent off for him
[2:06:59] and he went on a four-day journey away
[2:07:02] from them
[2:07:06] let me just drop this in here mind
[2:07:09] battles
[2:07:10] they had them
[2:07:13] mind battles jesus had them
[2:07:18] don't you know the mind battles he went
[2:07:20] through as he continued to go
[2:07:22] four days
[2:07:25] he had a vision but a vision don't stop
[2:07:27] mind battles
[2:07:32] the devil is still there to whisper
[2:07:35] whispering in the ears
[2:07:37] we've seen it we've heard the vision of
[2:07:39] the bride walking in step onward
[2:07:41] christian soldiers but it hasn't stopped
[2:07:42] your buying battle
[2:07:45] no jesus had him he had mind battles he
[2:07:49] had such mind battles that get the
[2:07:51] garden of gethsemane
[2:07:52] to where his sweat turned to blood
[2:07:56] and yet he had a vision of giving
[2:07:58] himself he had the word
[2:07:59] but he still had mind battles
[2:08:04] we all go through them even if we got a
[2:08:07] vision
[2:08:08] we go through them even if we got the
[2:08:10] word of god we go through them
[2:08:11] the devil is never going to give up that
[2:08:13] moment in your your mind to try you but
[2:08:15] you got to take that
[2:08:16] that is that is exalting itself above
[2:08:20] the word of god
[2:08:21] it's the devil trying to put a thought
[2:08:23] in your mind that's saying it's more
[2:08:24] important than what god said
[2:08:28] and here they are and he's walking away
[2:08:33] i thought about this as i was driving
[2:08:35] flying this away
[2:08:37] my mom was in her situation it began to
[2:08:40] strike me
[2:08:41] jesus having those mind battles
[2:08:48] it was on tuesday that i was really in a
[2:08:50] con
[2:08:51] quandary trying to figure out what i do
[2:08:53] what i where do i go
[2:08:55] do i stay lord used brother david
[2:08:59] kigley over there on a mower texted me
[2:09:02] and said you know
[2:09:04] the lord spoke to me and said for me and
[2:09:06] my family to be in those meetings
[2:09:08] i'm going to be there did that stop the
[2:09:11] mind battles
[2:09:12] no he still had them i still had them
[2:09:15] matter of fact he got up this morning
[2:09:17] his daughter is mariah
[2:09:20] is that right fainted
[2:09:24] had to be taken to er he was at a moment
[2:09:27] do i turn around do i say well we just
[2:09:30] stay home
[2:09:30] or do i speak and go forward he spoke
[2:09:33] and come forward
[2:09:36] because he knows god has something to
[2:09:38] store for his family
[2:09:41] his family has a need
[2:09:44] and god's here to meet that need
[2:09:48] he's heard your cry
[2:09:52] he heard their cry the very first day
[2:09:56] he heard it but he continued to walk
[2:10:01] because god has showed him something you
[2:10:04] know i was studying
[2:10:06] studying some of this and the in the
[2:10:08] history it talks about the sadducees
[2:10:10] that believed
[2:10:11] that a dead man could lay there dead for
[2:10:13] three days
[2:10:14] but his spirits still be there so if he
[2:10:16] rose in one two and three days it wasn't
[2:10:17] a miracle
[2:10:20] so god allowed it to come to a place to
[2:10:22] where everyone had to say
[2:10:23] this was a miracle
[2:10:26] god allows things to come to a place
[2:10:28] that critics can't deny it
[2:10:30] oh yeah they may laugh they may carry on
[2:10:34] there was a lot of them sitting on that
[2:10:35] hill laughing and
[2:10:37] smoking and making fun when he was
[2:10:38] standing there said jesus
[2:10:40] wept but he probably god said he
[2:10:42] gathered that little frame together
[2:10:45] and he said roll away the stone
[2:10:51] brother donnie one time at a youth camp
[2:10:53] done it so beautifully
[2:10:55] he said what happened he said he told
[2:10:57] martha and mary roll away this way the
[2:10:59] stone
[2:10:59] he said there's something you got to do
[2:11:02] you have to roll away the stone
[2:11:04] you have to put an act of faith in your
[2:11:06] heart to believe that all things are
[2:11:08] possible
[2:11:12] i'm gonna be there regardless of what
[2:11:14] happens
[2:11:17] he was rolling away the stone
[2:11:20] i'm gonna be there no matter what takes
[2:11:22] place you're rolling away the stone
[2:11:25] i'm going to be there if the situation
[2:11:27] gets worse i'm going to roll away the
[2:11:29] stone
[2:11:29] because i know when omnipotence begins
[2:11:31] to speak
[2:11:35] he said your brother was going to live
[2:11:37] and she said yay lord and
[2:11:39] the resurrection he said i am the
[2:11:41] resurrection and the life
[2:11:43] he brought her to this moment this is
[2:11:46] who i
[2:11:47] am right now and jesus christ
[2:11:51] is the same yesterday today and forever
[2:11:55] the devil may have decreed death over
[2:11:57] your life but there's another voice
[2:11:59] that is speaking right now i am the
[2:12:01] resurrection and the life
[2:12:03] [Applause]
[2:12:04] lazarus come forth in the name of jesus
[2:12:14] your diagnosis is not a verdict it's not
[2:12:18] the final word
[2:12:19] sickness you may say you may you may
[2:12:22] have a say devil you may have a say
[2:12:24] but i have good news what you say is
[2:12:27] subject to my god
[2:12:29] what you say is overruled by my god he
[2:12:32] has the final say
[2:12:34] on my life he has the final say on
[2:12:36] everything i go through
[2:12:37] so instead of say considering your
[2:12:39] circumstances you need to look at how
[2:12:41] big your god is
[2:12:44] and the bigger you make your god the
[2:12:46] smaller problems become
[2:12:48] and the more faith begins to rise up in
[2:12:50] your heart
[2:12:51] [Applause]
[2:12:52] experts can be wrong they can make the
[2:12:54] most educated guesses
[2:12:56] they can say what they know but be wrong
[2:12:59] but what they fail to add to the
[2:13:01] equation
[2:13:02] is there's a seed gene of god on the
[2:13:04] inside of here
[2:13:06] it's eternal life that's paul say
[2:13:08] [Applause]
[2:13:09] hey hallelujah brother ron it's not just
[2:13:13] your immune system that's fighting
[2:13:14] it's eternal life on the inside of you
[2:13:17] that's fighting against that cancer

[2:14:27] texans
[2:14:28] and all americans he said i've received
[2:14:31] this day such and such
[2:14:32] a letter of surrender with the decree

[2:15:38] [Applause]
[2:15:43] he wrote that whole letter in the bottom
[2:15:45] of it he signed p.s
[2:15:47] the lord is on our side
[2:15:50] whoo my god if a colonel could make that
[2:15:54] declaration

[2:17:03] years after the promise
[2:17:04] they came into a final word sarah gave
[2:17:08] birth to a son
[2:17:09] god overrode all the laws of nature
[2:17:12] he overrode what the expert says he
[2:17:15] overrode mistakes that they had made
[2:17:17] if abraham were here today he would
[2:17:19] declare don't let circumstances talk you
[2:17:22] out
[2:17:22] of what god put in you it may look dead
[2:17:25] it may seem impossible but the experts
[2:17:28] have no
[2:17:28] say they may say no way but they have no
[2:17:32] say but i can tell you firsthand god
[2:17:35] has a final say
[2:17:42] oh praise the lord let me say it like
[2:17:44] this i don't mean to turn carnal here
[2:17:46] but anybody ever watch the ball game
[2:17:50] oh boy
[2:17:54] you're people pulling for their favorite
[2:17:56] team and
[2:17:57] their team's got the ball and it's the
[2:17:58] last last last
[2:18:01] throw that they can make and tom's just
[2:18:03] about to run out just a few seconds left
[2:18:05] quarterback runs back he throws a pass
[2:18:08] and you're getting ready to jump and
[2:18:09] shout and it's intercepted
[2:18:13] [Music]

[2:18:21] i've heard of people turning the tv off
[2:18:23] and walking outside
[2:18:25] being all discouraged and down because
[2:18:27] their team lost
[2:18:29] but there was a final say that was there
[2:18:34] and a referee stepped up and blew a
[2:18:37] whistle
[2:18:38] said there was too many men on the field
[2:18:39] on the defense play one more down
[2:18:44] but what happened they played that one
[2:18:47] more down
[2:18:48] quarterback went back threw a touchdown
[2:18:50] game over they won
[2:18:52] but guess what you missed it
[2:18:57] you know why because you turned the tv
[2:18:59] off too soon
[2:19:00] you went outside you just walked away
[2:19:02] and thought there ain't no hope
[2:19:03] there ain't no way this is going to
[2:19:05] happen it's over with
[2:19:07] it ain't over with till god says it's
[2:19:09] over with
[2:19:12] the other team may be dumping gatorade
[2:19:14] congratulating their coach
[2:19:16] but there's a final say that's about to
[2:19:18] speak
[2:19:19] that is even speaking right now devil
[2:19:22] let me remind you

[2:19:34] shouting they was waving old pom-poms
[2:19:36] and they was dancing and making laps
[2:19:38] around hell but it was too early

[2:19:46] and it was the i am they had read the
[2:19:48] first part of it but they failed to read
[2:19:50] the last part of it
[2:19:53] oh hallelujah and he walked down into
[2:19:56] hell
[2:19:56] and he said devil i've come to claim
[2:19:59] what's my

[2:20:08] his own house

[2:20:15] it gives power to lock it or unlock it
[2:20:17] but the devil can't even do that
[2:20:19] therefore if he ain't got power over his
[2:20:20] own house he don't have power over that
[2:20:23] cancer
[2:20:24] he can't lock it or unlock it it's the
