[0:00] [Music]
[0:38] see how we can
[0:39] rest upon his word then no matter how
[0:42] hard the storm flows
[0:44] what's contrary to it rest solemnly upon
[0:47] the word
[0:48] amen god said it you've seen the other
[0:50] side of the storm
[0:53] so if you're sickest anchor your
[0:56] soul in the haven of rest
[1:00] if you're perplexed and distressed
[1:01] remember he said
[1:03] i'll be with you always even to the end
[1:07] of it
[1:10] and he's he said all things work
[1:13] together for
[1:14] good to them and love the lord so just
[1:16] stay right there
[1:18] one man wrote a poet wrote my anchor
[1:22] holds within the veil what is a veil is
[1:25] something that shuts off
[1:27] here from there and the anchor
[1:30] is on the inside of the veil
[1:34] you don't see how it's going to be but
[1:36] you know that there's
[1:38] something that's got a hold of you
[1:41] that's got to hold
[1:42] up there and when the sea
[1:45] is blowing and starving has ever i guess
[1:48] maybe somebody has never been privileged
[1:50] to see a ship anchored
[1:52] oh my i wrote them on it throughout a
[1:55] sea anchor like that
[1:56] until the little craft couldn't even go
[1:58] over the top the the wave it would go
[2:00] through the way but as long as the
[2:03] anchor helps
[2:05] that's all makes any difference whether
[2:07] we go over underground or through it
[2:09] doesn't matter the anchor hole
[2:14] that's the way when storms of life begin
[2:16] to
[2:17] shake us we may have to go through and
[2:20] they have to go over under around
[2:22] but just let the anchor hole within the
[2:24] veil to the unseen
[2:26] we don't know just exactly where it's at
[2:29] but it's a holding
[2:31] just like the little boy you know that
[2:33] had the kite you've heard the old
[2:35] proverb the story said how do you know
[2:38] you got a coyote in there so i can still
[2:40] feel it tugging
[2:41] so that's it if we can feel it still
[2:45] tugging god
[2:46] dealing with our hearts then we know our
[2:49] anchor
[2:49] still holds i believe it was benjamin
[2:52] franklin who caught the lightning
[2:54] in the bottle who harnessed lightning
[2:56] electricity
[2:57] something within him called and said
[3:00] there's
[3:01] power in that that power could be
[3:04] harnessed and if it's that powerful to
[3:07] shoot the streaks and the bursts of
[3:09] timbers split over the ground
[3:11] what could it do if it was once
[3:14] harnessed
[3:15] it'll lighten flesh and hit the whole
[3:17] earth
[3:18] and benjamin franklin i believe fishing
[3:21] on his kite
[3:22] with a key tied on the end of the tail
[3:24] of a bottle down at the bottom
[3:26] and when he got it he didn't know what
[3:29] he had
[3:30] but he began to scream i got it i got it
[3:34] he didn't know what it was he didn't
[3:35] know what he was going to do with it
[3:38] but he know he had something and that's
[3:41] the way with every man that's
[3:43] hopes are built on nothing less
[3:46] than jesus blood with righteousness
[3:49] all around my soul gives way then he's
[3:53] all my
[3:54] hope and state on christ's solid rock i
[3:57] stand all other grounds
[3:59] is sinking sins once born again the holy
[4:02] spirit takes its place
[4:04] into the heart some young people may not
[4:06] are young or maybe illiterate
[4:08] no matter how it is there's no one can
[4:11] explain it so don't feel bad because
[4:13] you're illiterate
[4:14] you couldn't explain it there's never
[4:15] been a man yet could explain it no
[4:17] matter how
[4:18] smart or high intelligent it's god's own
[4:20] secret
[4:21] amen but when that word takes life in
[4:23] your heart you see it
[4:25] you scream i got it
[4:28] you don't know what you're going to do
[4:30] with it you don't know what it's going
[4:31] to do with you
[4:33] but you know something's happened amen
[4:36] and you got it

[1:05:32] and he's still walking talking
[1:05:35] today because he's as far as i know
[1:05:39] cancer free
[1:05:48] if he can heal a woman that was given
[1:05:51] five
[1:05:51] minutes to five years to live
[1:05:56] but if she did live she would have been
[1:05:59] a vegetable
[1:06:01] stage the rest of her life because of
[1:06:03] that brain
[1:06:04] bleed yet this woman wasn't in the

[1:06:11] in there just for a very short time
[1:06:13] and is walking talking miracle her name
[1:06:18] is
[1:06:18] karen pruitt
[1:06:27] imagine what god can do for you

[1:06:34] want to say it to the world
[1:06:36] imagine what god can do for you
[1:06:41] now let's talk about a little bit about
[1:06:43] our god
[1:06:44] he conquered sickness he conquered
[1:06:47] temptation
[1:06:48] when the enemy spit in his face and
[1:06:50] smote his jaw
[1:06:51] he turned the other side just a few
[1:06:53] moments we sung about a champion
[1:06:55] this is our champion this is who i am
[1:06:59] identified with tonight
[1:07:01] when they jerked this beard from his
[1:07:03] face and spit on him
[1:07:05] he never reviled back he conquered the
[1:07:07] gate of temptation he took it
[1:07:09] then you say my temper won't let me do
[1:07:12] it he said you seed of abraham
[1:07:14] he he can conquer it for you
[1:07:18] when he reviled when he was reviled upon
[1:07:20] he reviled not back
[1:07:22] when he was made fun of he held his
[1:07:24] peace
[1:07:25] when he was called the devil he held his
[1:07:28] peace
[1:07:29] he had one business that was the
[1:07:31] father's business
[1:07:33] and he went about doing that
[1:07:36] and then finally they they took him to a
[1:07:39] cross
[1:07:40] and death had to face him all of the
[1:07:43] rest of them had conquered seas
[1:07:46] they'd conquered nature they conquered
[1:07:48] lines
[1:07:49] they conquered fire they had conquered
[1:07:52] everything but death
[1:07:54] but here was one beating in his brain
[1:07:58] his veins that they that had conquered
[1:08:01] the death so they took his hands and
[1:08:04] stretched him out
[1:08:05] and nailed him to a cross and they beat
[1:08:08] him
[1:08:08] and they stripped him till his bones
[1:08:11] started him
[1:08:12] but when he did they'd done all that
[1:08:14] they could do
[1:08:15] for him death struck him
[1:08:19] and said now i'll take you like i did
[1:08:22] joshua
[1:08:23] i'll take you like i did daniel and i'll
[1:08:26] do all this because i'll
[1:08:28] make you die but i've got news for you
[1:08:31] this morning

[1:08:46] hallelujah he is not dead
[1:08:49] but he is very much alive
[1:08:57] a friend of mine named tim nunnweiler
[1:09:00] sent me a note this week
[1:09:03] he said i was listening to general
[1:09:05] norman schwarzkopf
[1:09:08] he was a general over the gulf war and
[1:09:11] he was talking about what makes an
[1:09:13] effective army
[1:09:16] it's not the technology it's not the
[1:09:19] number of soldiers
[1:09:21] he said he looks at two different things
[1:09:24] when evaluating an army
[1:09:28] dedication to the cause
[1:09:31] the will to fight they are the more
[1:09:35] important than everything else
[1:09:38] and tim tim nunnwaller wrote me this he
[1:09:41] said
[1:09:42] i thought of another general
[1:09:46] you he said there's a tiger behind your
[1:09:50] eyes
[1:09:52] i would say satan saw that tiger
[1:09:58] it's more than a spencer tiger it's a
[1:10:00] god tiger
[1:10:03] he said in god's invincible army
[1:10:06] only we have much more
[1:10:09] we have the best weapon that there is
[1:10:14] too
[1:10:20] in the middle of a sermon and it's you
[1:10:22] know sometimes you're sitting in a
[1:10:23] service
[1:10:25] and all of a sudden there's a quote that
[1:10:27] just begins and
[1:10:28] brother brandon would just fall into a
[1:10:30] spot and then god would just
[1:10:32] amen god and he would just fall into a
[1:10:35] spot and god
[1:10:36] just don't amen sometimes you're sitting
[1:10:39] in a service yourselves
[1:10:41] and all of a sudden the word that is a
[1:10:45] very discerner of the heart

[1:11:32] now challenge the devil to a debate
[1:11:36] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:40] this was more than a prophet amen
[1:11:44] this was more than a man but this was
[1:11:47] under the administration of the son of
[1:11:49] man in this age
[1:11:52] are you with me this is more than just
[1:11:54] probing at the word and guessing at the
[1:11:57] word
[1:11:58] but in full authority i now
[1:12:01] challenge the devil to a debate
[1:12:05] two worlds standing against one another
[1:12:12] satan you're aware
[1:12:17] that you're whipped
[1:12:23] you have no legal rights
[1:12:26] jesus christ my lord
[1:12:29] stripped you of every authority
[1:12:33] that you had and when he died at calvary
[1:12:37] to take away
[1:12:38] sin and sickness and you're
[1:12:41] nothing but a bluff and we're calling
[1:12:45] your bluff
[1:12:47] you know that when our lord came to the
[1:12:50] tree he
[1:12:51] cursed the tree and the next day it was
[1:12:54] withering
[1:12:55] and our lord said to his disciples have
[1:12:58] faith in god
[1:13:01] for if you say ye shall say to the
[1:13:04] mountain
[1:13:05] be removed don't doubt in your heart
[1:13:09] but believe what you have said is coming
[1:13:13] to pass
[1:13:14] and you can have what you
[1:13:17] said now watch what he does now
[1:13:21] satan you know the scripture on that
[1:13:28] so what he is doing he's actually
[1:13:31] calling satan to a debate
[1:13:34] and reminding him you were there
[1:13:38] and you were a witness to it did it
[1:13:41] happen or didn't it happen
[1:13:44] did he have the power or didn't he have
[1:13:46] a power to do it
[1:13:51] and he said i just had i just taught
[1:13:53] this people
[1:13:55] that god is in them
[1:13:58] i've just preached this sermon that god
[1:14:00] is in them
[1:14:01] i want to remind you that god is in you
[1:14:04] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:14:07] you ask what you will
[1:14:09] and it shall be done unto you
[1:14:12] god is in them and if god is in them and
[1:14:14] they speak to that disease
[1:14:16] and say be away from me and don't doubt
[1:14:19] in their heart
[1:14:21] right then that disease has to move
[1:14:25] for christ said so for it's not them
[1:14:28] that speaks
[1:14:29] it's the father that dwells in them
[1:14:32] that's speaking
[1:14:34] they're in need so come out of them in
[1:14:37] the name of jesus christ
[1:14:39] i say as god servant by a message of an
[1:14:42] angel
[1:14:43] who who anointed and and has proved to
[1:14:46] the people
[1:14:47] that jesus is here and the message is
[1:14:50] right
[1:14:55] so come out of them in the name of jesus
[1:14:59] christ
[1:15:00] i adore you to leave every sick person
[1:15:04] and get into outer darkness in the
[1:15:07] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:15:15] and a roar of wind went through the
[1:15:18] building
[1:15:22] and a roar of wind
[1:15:25] went through the building brethren
[1:15:28] says that was him that was him
[1:15:32] you see got to back his word up
[1:15:36] so i on that i'd like to
[1:15:39] take just a little bit of a theme this
[1:15:41] morning
[1:15:44] and stir satan's memory
[1:15:49] i like to stir his memory just a little
[1:15:51] bit
[1:15:56] if you'll remember there was a before
[1:15:58] and after many times in the scriptures
[1:16:02] the before man the testimony
[1:16:07] and then the after
[1:16:12] satan i'd like to take you to abraham's
[1:16:14] tent
[1:16:17] you obviously was there you're not
[1:16:20] said in the scripture but you was
[1:16:22] obviously there because
[1:16:24] you watch those lights come from out of
[1:16:26] heaven and step into a body
[1:16:30] and you watch melchizedek and the two
[1:16:32] angels
[1:16:33] come and sit at the tent and you know
[1:16:36] that that was the voice that came out of
[1:16:38] that body was the same voice
[1:16:41] that had been talking to abraham now for
[1:16:43] years
[1:16:45] and we would say just about 20 years it
[1:16:48] was that same voice because
[1:16:50] abraham called him lord elohim
[1:16:54] and he and he began to talk lip to ear
[1:16:56] to god himself
[1:16:58] now god had made him a promise and that
[1:17:01] promise
[1:17:02] now was some 20-some years passed and
[1:17:04] now
[1:17:05] abraham had been testifying i'm going to
[1:17:08] have a son
[1:17:10] and he testified his neighbors had heard
[1:17:12] about it
[1:17:13] i'm going to have a son the older he got
[1:17:16] the more impossible that it was
[1:17:18] but it wasn't up to abraham to produce
[1:17:21] the promise
[1:17:22] it's up to god to produce the promise
[1:17:26] it isn't up to us to produce the rapture
[1:17:29] of the resurrection
[1:17:30] it's up to god to do it and he'll do it
[1:17:33] exactly like he said it would do
[1:17:36] it's up to us to believe him and take
[1:17:38] him at his word
[1:17:40] oh brother ron but i don't understand it
[1:17:41] doesn't make a difference whether you
[1:17:43] understand
[1:17:44] it or not just take him at his word and
[1:17:47] believe it with all your hearts
[1:17:49] [Applause]
[1:17:56] hallelujah
[1:18:00] i just want to take just a glimpse here
[1:18:02] just for a moment
[1:18:03] you've been abraham's neighbor for years
[1:18:07] you've lived in the tent just right down
[1:18:09] from him now you're journeying with him
[1:18:14] abraham walked into his tent the night
[1:18:16] before
[1:18:18] an old man
[1:18:21] grey-headed stupid shoulders
[1:18:25] and this morning he walks out young
[1:18:32] now sarah she walked into that same tent
[1:18:36] an old woman
[1:18:39] but the next morning she walks out young
[1:18:43] and a matter of fact she is so beautiful
[1:18:45] till the king
[1:18:47] wants to have her as his wife
[1:18:51] that was a mystery under the seven seals
[1:18:53] brother branham said
[1:18:54] that god held that for literally
[1:18:57] hundreds and thousands of years
[1:19:00] and some of the greatest philosophers
[1:19:02] and preachers in the world
[1:19:03] had never caught the mystery but
[1:19:07] god transformed their body
[1:19:10] to meet the challenge of the hour
[1:19:14] that same god has the power to transform
[1:19:18] not just abraham and sarah's body but a
[1:19:21] universal rapture
[1:19:23] around the world
[1:19:30] graves will give way the sea will give
[1:19:33] way
[1:19:34] all the way back to the ashes and the
[1:19:36] gases
[1:19:37] we'll step from that dimension into this
[1:19:39] dimension
[1:19:45] there moses stood with a rod in his hand
[1:19:49] that same rod that swallowed snakes
[1:19:53] now stretches out across a red sea
[1:19:56] when the enemy looked like he was going
[1:19:59] to destroy them
[1:20:02] let me just remind you of the scripture
[1:20:05] and when pharaoh drew nothing
[1:20:09] the children of israel lifted up their
[1:20:12] eyes
[1:20:13] and beheld the egyptian marched after
[1:20:16] them
[1:20:17] and they were sore afraid and the
[1:20:19] children of israel cried out unto the
[1:20:21] lord
[1:20:22] and they said unto moses because there
[1:20:25] were
[1:20:26] no graves in egypt hast thou taken us
[1:20:29] away to die in the wilderness wherefore
[1:20:33] hast thou
[1:20:34] melt thus with us to carry us forth
[1:20:37] out of egypt is not this the word
[1:20:41] that we did tell thee in egypt saying
[1:20:44] let us alone may we serve the egyptians
[1:20:48] for it had been better for us
[1:20:50] to serve the egyptian then we would die
[1:20:53] in this wilderness
[1:20:56] how quickly circumstances would change
[1:20:59] your faith if you're not careful
[1:21:02] why would you bring that scripture up
[1:21:04] there's a lot of people has
[1:21:06] melted under the pressure of stage four
[1:21:09] cancer
[1:21:13] there's a lot of people that's melted
[1:21:15] under a lot less circumstances than what
[1:21:17] you fight
[1:21:18] but something keeps holding you
[1:21:23] when you can't hold yourself
[1:21:30] i don't care how how much the devil
[1:21:32] whispers in your ear
[1:21:34] it's impossible it's impossible
[1:21:38] it's impossible but one day abraham
[1:21:42] stepped out of the tent a young man
[1:21:46] he just held onto the promise that god
[1:21:48] made to him
[1:21:49] he looked him in the eyes he had heard
[1:21:51] his voice
[1:21:53] but he knew one day god would perform
[1:21:56] his word
[1:21:58] moses said unto the people fear you not
[1:22:01] stand still
[1:22:02] and see the salvation of the lord
[1:22:05] which he will show you today
[1:22:11] for the egyptians whom ye have seen
[1:22:14] today
[1:22:16] you shall see them again no more
[1:22:22] forever
[1:22:26] [Laughter]
[1:22:28] let it sink in satan do you remember
[1:22:30] that
[1:22:32] do you remember that day surely you
[1:22:36] remember abraham coming out of the tent
[1:22:38] young
[1:22:42] surely surely you remember those
[1:22:45] egyptians coming down on them
[1:22:47] those people that look like the worst
[1:22:48] bloodbath in the whole world
[1:22:50] surely you remember that
[1:22:55] surely you remember what happened in
[1:22:57] just a little bit
[1:22:59] the sea opened up
[1:23:02] it opened up and those people went
[1:23:05] across
[1:23:06] on dry land oh yeah the scoffers said
[1:23:09] well it was just a reeve that they
[1:23:11] walked across
[1:23:12] well isn't that something the greatest
[1:23:14] army in the whole world
[1:23:18] drowned in your excuse
[1:23:23] hallelujah
[1:23:25] [Applause]
[1:23:27] you want to give me an excuse of that it
[1:23:30] didn't happen
[1:23:31] the greatest army in the whole world
[1:23:34] drowned let me tell you about scoffers
[1:23:39] let me tell you about critics they hung
[1:23:42] around an ark just in case
[1:23:48] they hung around an ark just in case
[1:23:50] they listened to a preacher for 120
[1:23:53] years
[1:23:53] and they made fun of him they built
[1:23:56] their own
[1:23:57] hearts and one day the god
[1:24:00] shut the door and day after day they
[1:24:04] made fun of them
[1:24:06] but there come a time that they believe
[1:24:08] the message
[1:24:10] [Music]
[1:24:11] oh they believe the message
[1:24:14] they believe the message when the
[1:24:16] heavens opened up and the villas of the
[1:24:18] deep opened up
[1:24:21] but moses couldn't reach out and save
[1:24:23] them because god had sent them a message
[1:24:26] to get inside of the ark listen world
[1:24:29] god
[1:24:29] sent this world a message
[1:24:32] you're hanging on the fringes oh one day
[1:24:35] i'm gonna run in when los
[1:24:36] angeles let me just say the rapture is
[1:24:39] already in progress
[1:24:43] there's more than cancer leaving this
[1:24:45] body
[1:24:46] there's a rapture that's happening to it
[1:24:50] molecule after molecule is taking place
[1:24:54] this mortal's going to take on
[1:24:56] immortality
[1:24:57] and we're going to be changed in the
[1:25:00] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:25:23] maybe his memory is not as good as it
[1:25:25] should be so
[1:25:26] maybe satan's got dementia so we just
[1:25:28] kind of bring him up a little bit
[1:25:33] the girl named georgia carter was laid
[1:25:35] in a bed for over nine years
[1:25:38] tortured by a disease
[1:25:41] and she got a hold of a book of the
[1:25:43] promises of god
[1:25:45] and she believed for herself that she
[1:25:47] could be healed and god sent a prophet
[1:25:50] god sent a prophet to where she was at
[1:25:54] and there was a lot of people that was
[1:25:55] against it but god sent a prophet there
[1:25:58] for that little girl i want to remind
[1:26:01] you satan she didn't lay
[1:26:03] in that bed no longer after he arrived
[1:26:06] [Applause]
[1:26:07] but she went out into the grass and
[1:26:09] began to pick the grass and the flowers
[1:26:11] and smell the flowers
[1:26:12] rolling the grass then she went in and
[1:26:14] played the piano
[1:26:17] [Applause]
[1:26:18] i want to remind you that god not only
[1:26:20] sent that prophet to
[1:26:22] to down to milltown but he sent him to
[1:26:25] memphis
[1:26:27] by the way of grounding an airplane
[1:26:29] because
[1:26:30] a woman had a meat
[1:26:36] you know sometimes we think about
[1:26:38] brother branham and god speaking to
[1:26:40] brother branham and speaking of
[1:26:41] squirrels into existence or
[1:26:43] storm out of existence but let me just
[1:26:45] take a take it to the believer
[1:26:47] here's a woman that had never heard
[1:26:49] brother branham speak
[1:26:51] she didn't know he was a prophet she
[1:26:53] knew nothing about
[1:26:54] what he was what he stood for but she
[1:26:57] prayed a prayer
[1:26:58] where's my elijah
[1:26:59] [Applause]
[1:27:02] are you with me and brother branham said
[1:27:06] to brother bischoff and we're going to
[1:27:08] borrow it
[1:27:09] he said that woman created that storm
[1:27:16] that's how much power that you have
[1:27:19] and brother adam starts walking going to
[1:27:21] put some mail in
[1:27:23] and starts walking and the angel said
[1:27:25] just walk
[1:27:27] and gives him instructions and he's
[1:27:29] going mind singing a little tune
[1:27:31] and he goes back good morning annie good

[1:27:46] her boy was dying
[1:27:49] dying of a disease and he
[1:27:52] she walked in brother branham walks in
[1:27:54] behind her
[1:27:55] he called it a small house shanty at one
[1:27:58] place and he says
[1:27:59] said he looked around there's pictures
[1:28:02] of jesus
[1:28:03] on the wall and he that's what brother
[1:28:06] random did he says
[1:28:09] won't you pray
[1:28:12] won't you pray
[1:28:17] a whole lot different than a lot of
[1:28:18] these modern day evangelists
[1:28:24] don't you pray
[1:28:29] brother joe i love this part
[1:28:32] brother branham said i've been in four
[1:28:34] castles in the world
[1:28:38] they say brother branham never did go
[1:28:39] pray for king george but history tells
[1:28:42] us different
[1:28:44] tells us different brother bill
[1:28:49] i mean you've conversed over this many
[1:28:50] times and me and you brother joe's been
[1:28:52] heard so
[1:28:52] many times king george went and played
[1:28:55] golf the next day
[1:28:58] after brother brown prays for him
[1:29:03] brother branham said it he said i've
[1:29:04] been in four castles
[1:29:07] and he said i've never felt more
[1:29:09] comfortable
[1:29:10] than in that home
[1:29:14] he said she knew jesus
[1:29:21] let that sink let that sink
[1:29:31] you know a couple of years ago within a
[1:29:34] week
[1:29:36] i stood in tiananmen square
[1:29:39] in china
[1:29:44] and then i went into the forbidden city
[1:29:47] brother tom ray and brother murphy wong
[1:29:56] but they took me to an apartment
[1:30:00] where a little woman got down on her
[1:30:03] knees
[1:30:04] in front of us right there
[1:30:09] and she said i never dreamed i'd get to
[1:30:12] meet you in person
[1:30:14] i'm so glad to have you in my home
[1:30:18] woman probably about 60 couple years old
[1:30:25] her prayers put us there
[1:30:31] be with me i'll never forget that time
[1:30:35] listen within a week i'm standing
[1:30:38] in the oval office
[1:30:43] but brother tim pruitt and brother mike
[1:30:46] walls
[1:30:49] say brother ron but this message is just
[1:30:51] for a little corner
[1:30:52] you've come way too late to tell me that
[1:30:54] business
[1:30:58] you've come way too late to tell me that
[1:31:00] business the most
[1:31:02] powerful people on the earth
[1:31:05] is the people that we preach to
[1:31:09] because somewhere you step from another
[1:31:12] dimension
[1:31:13] out of eternity into time
[1:31:17] and the seed of god which you possess
[1:31:20] was with him before the foundation of
[1:31:22] the world
[1:31:23] and it's in you now
[1:31:25] [Applause]
[1:31:26] and i want to remind you that satan
[1:31:29] cannot
[1:31:30] touch you he cannot destroy you
[1:31:34] until god's purpose has been fulfilled
[1:31:40] i feel like shouting and running all
[1:31:41] over this building
[1:31:46] hallelujah
[1:31:48] [Applause]
[1:31:52] houston debate you remember that
[1:31:57] you remember that brother and said i'll
[1:31:59] just well he was instructed to stay in
[1:32:01] the balcony
[1:32:02] and he stayed there until the angel
[1:32:04] nudged him to go on down
[1:32:09] and as he walked down that little
[1:32:11] prophet of god as he walked down
[1:32:14] he came to the stage
[1:32:17] brother bran was no cocky man
[1:32:22] he was a very much a gentleman
[1:32:25] and as a matter of fact if you go back
[1:32:27] and read
[1:32:29] brother branham actually
[1:32:33] made great statements about dr best
[1:32:38] they said that was a strange thing about
[1:32:39] brother branham they couldn't tell his
[1:32:41] enemies from his friends
[1:32:50] oh that god would so fill our lives
[1:32:53] oh that god would so fill our lives
[1:32:59] that's why they made a god out of him
[1:33:02] they were wrong in doing that but
[1:33:04] that's why they saw so much god in him
[1:33:06] until they made a god out of him
[1:33:13] may that be a live inside of us
[1:33:20] just a bit of brandon begins to talk
[1:33:23] about how many has been healed in the
[1:33:25] meeting this week
[1:33:26] just thousands of hands begin to go up
[1:33:29] and he makes a few statements and a
[1:33:31] whirl starts coming through the building
[1:33:34] that pillar of fire that picture that
[1:33:37] hangs in most of our homes
[1:33:39] that picture of that pillar of fire
[1:33:42] hangs there
[1:33:43] hangs in our best view now i'm not
[1:33:46] ashamed to be identified with that
[1:33:50] i'm not a bit ashamed to be identified
[1:33:52] with that
[1:33:53] i'm not ashamed to be identified with
[1:33:54] wigan branham
[1:33:56] but more than that i'm not ashamed to be
[1:33:57] identified with that pillar of fire
[1:34:00] because it's here now
[1:34:05] the other day in the dream brother brown
[1:34:07] said would you like to have your picture
[1:34:08] taken with me
[1:34:12] i'm not ashamed to be identified whether
[1:34:14] it's in a dream
[1:34:15] or whether it's in a vision or whether
[1:34:17] it's in flesh
[1:34:19] i'm not ashamed of this message
[1:34:36] well you're following a man well who are
[1:34:37] you following
[1:34:40] and where is he taking you
[1:34:45] you left the message and now you go to a

[1:41:11] have enough
[1:41:15] one night in a church service like this
[1:41:17] one right here
[1:41:20] she was sitting in the balcony and and
[1:41:23] they began to sing
[1:41:24] leaning on the everlasting arms and she
[1:41:27] had been
[1:41:27] tortured she had been going through
[1:41:30] treatment after
[1:41:31] treatment and she was sitting there so
[1:41:33] weakened in her body
[1:41:34] and death is swirling that bee of death
[1:41:37] is swirling around her
[1:41:39] that thing that's trying to kill her and

[1:43:14] take him at his word and the most
[1:43:18] supernatural thing about
[1:43:19] you is your tongue let it come from your
[1:43:23] heart

[1:44:15] bride of jesus christ

[2:00:40] going on
[2:00:42] on that side and on this side and we're
[2:00:44] getting closer and closer

[2:00:57] just like he said
[2:01:00] don't you just claim it right now full
[2:01:03] restoration
[2:01:07] i think about the sermon it says take it
[2:01:09] back
[2:01:12] that's what the bride is doing she's
[2:01:13] taking it back
[2:01:16] just taking it back what adam stepped
[2:01:18] out of we're getting ready to step into
[2:01:22] we're taking it back in the name of
[2:01:24] jesus christ
[2:01:25] what satan has robbed from you take it

[2:01:56] oh god
[2:02:00] this gravity is getting ready to turn
[2:02:02] loose
[2:02:06] oh the sun had to stand still because
[2:02:08] the son of god was on the earth
[2:02:10] needing 24 more hours but there's a
[2:02:14] bride on the earth
[2:02:15] that's getting ready to step into a new
[2:02:17] body
[2:02:18] because another dimension is giving way
[2:02:25] they without us cannot be made perfect
[2:02:29] the lord jesus just now
[2:02:33] whether it's a restoration of a home
[2:02:36] whether it's a prodigal coming back

[2:03:18] way and when satan would come in with
[2:03:21] these cold clammy hands of death
[2:03:23] the angel of god would step him back
[2:03:27] at the name of jesus christ
[2:03:31] house of hell give way in the name of
[2:03:34] jesus christ hallelujah
