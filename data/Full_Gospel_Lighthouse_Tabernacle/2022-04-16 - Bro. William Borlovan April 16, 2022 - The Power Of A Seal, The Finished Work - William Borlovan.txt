their own and they're doing it in their own way we're doing it like christians we're celebrating the resurrection of jesus christ and he's the very reason and his amazing grace why each and every one of us is standing right here there's nothing we can do there's no there's no good work we can do to deserve to be a christian it's all by god's amazing grace we're no better than anybody else but it's our lord and savior jesus christ that made these things possible amen aren't you thankful to be a christian we should be the happiest people on the face of the earth to be a christian because friends this world is hopeless they're helpless there's hopeless they've got nothing to offer one another but we've been given a promise and we're here because of that promise let's go to the lord in prayer the gracious kind heavenly father lord jesus i stand here lord this evening lord the very purchase of your blood the very redeemed of god father and lord jesus we just don't take these moments lightly but father we thank you lord for this opportunity lord to come and be gathered together around your word lord now you've predestinated this moment father and you've re you predestinated lord the word that is even to come forth and lord jesus we just ask that you forgive us of our sins we want to pray o god that may your word and your will lord be spoken and lord i as the speaker lord i give you my soul my body my spirit lord may you use me in some way father lord to speak a word of encouragement to your bride to your wife may i wash her feet lord tonight lord with with the word father lord matters yield to you as a vessel and lord we just pray over this congregation we just pray oh god that your word and your will will wash us make us new lord may our hearts burn within us with the renewed zeal and passion and a fresh appreciation for what you've done for us a fresh appreciation for the resurrection father we ask that you bless bless each and every one in divine presence bless every word that spoken may be for your honor to glory we ask that you please be with all the believers there at the camp lord continue to bless them in a special way we ask you bless us now father lord as we're here in your divine presence in the lovely name of jesus we pray and ask all these things amen amen god bless you if you will turn in the scriptures with me we're reading a few places beginning with ephesians ephesians chapter 1. don't you love the lord tonight ephesians chapter 1 begin on verse 13 say amen when you have it you know we gather every weekend this is easter weekend but we gather every weekend to honor his resurrection we're telling the lord that we believe he raised from the dead and that there should be a resurrection of life of his life in our own lives and we honor him amen ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 in whom he also trusted after that he heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory ephesians 4 30 and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption and now if you're trying with me to john 19 and while you're flipping there john 19 verse 25 with help of the lord i'd like to speak to you this evening with the power of a seal a finished work and if the lord will just help us grab a hold of this i believe it'll change on how we on on how we think of ourselves many times we've got to recognize who we are as christians you say brother william that's preached all the time across this pulpit that's exactly right because that's what the message of the hour is is to teach us brother shannon who we are because if you don't know who you are then you can't exercise your authority over the devil in john 19 verse 25 now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and his mother's sister mary the wife of cleopas and mary magdalene when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciples standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own house and after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and he gave up the ghost god bless you you can be seated the power of a seal we know that a seal means a finished work so when jesus was dying on the cross he went through all that agony and he when he said it is finished what does that mean that means that what is finished redemption is finished salvation is finished your your healing is finished everything that you have need of was finished when he paid the full price now jesus walked in a very conscious manner jesus knew and as he walked on the earth he knew exactly where he was he knew who he was and he was able to make powerful statements like this brother jerry he said i came from god and i go back to god he knew where he came from he knew where he was he knew what his work was what his purpose was and he knew where he was going well if the groom knows that then the bridegroom the if the bridegroom knows that rather then the bride must also know where she came from why she's here on the earth and where she's going there's libraries and multitudes of books that are written about find your purpose in life a purpose-driven life what is the purpose we know what purpose we have to be here on the earth we know why god has called us unto this hour so when you know where your position is you know who god called you to be you can then stand in authority and you can then stand toe to toe with the devil because you know there's no power within yourself but you have all of heaven that is behind you when you read the scripture in jesus all the agony that he went through all the suffering that he went through all the cruel beating that he had gone through he was on the cross all of his organs they say you could see them through the ribs he was beat so bad he was still in that state yet he was still conscious enough to know that there was still a scripture left off so the bible tells us in saint john that knowing that the scripture might be fulfilled he was hanging on the cross with nails in in his hands and in his feet with all the sin of the world upon him with your sin with my sin yet he was still conscious and knew there was a word that still needed to be fulfilled so in order to fulfill that word he said i thirst and when they took that that when they took that reed that sponge and they gave him that vinegar he then said it is finished because in psalm 69 21 david said they gave me also golf for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink jesus knew he had one more scripture to fulfill and when that final scripture was fulfilled he then said it is finished now a seal as i said is a finished work and we are perfect in him remember the baptism of the holy ghost the holy ghost on your soul is a finished work you say i still see so many mistakes in my life i still see so many things i need to change but god gives you the holy ghost based on predestination he gives you the holy ghost not knowing what you're going to do tomorrow or the next day or what you're going to do with it he gives you the holy ghost knowing that it's going to take you it's what you need and he knows that you're going to stay with it and in it because it's keeping you so your the holy ghost is keeping you so he gives it to you based on predestination and even though as newborn babes the bible says we desire the sincere milk of the word and we're born again and we need to grow up in that stature the bible talks about of a perfect man but god gives you the holy ghost now to equip you for that and then you're then transformed you're go from glory to glory and god knows that you're gonna be there because he's given you the down payment of it he's done sealed you and once something's been sealed you can't unseal it we are justified by faith in the finished work of calvary we are benefactors of calvary 2000 years ago right now this very moment because we know that the holy ghost is the literal life of jesus christ that is how that is proof of his resurrection it is proof of his resurrection because the same life that lived in him lives in the holy ghost believer so if the same life that was in him is in you is going to make you act the same way it's going to make you attracted to the word the same way it's going to make you overcome the devil the same way it's going to make you know your position in scripture the same way the prophet teaches us that everything we have need of everything that you'll ever need in life is given to you at the time of the baptism of the holy ghost he said including the rapture but see it's a seal it's in there everything you have need of is in you at the time of the holy ghost it's there it's just got to be come out well how does it come out by feeding it with the word not just from week into weekend all week long every day is an experience and it draws the life of christ out of your very being didn't jesus say that about person that has the holy ghost out of his belly shall flow rivers of water brother brahm told us and brother shannon you you'll be familiar with this about loading train cars and he told us about how he used to work with his dad on the trains and how they would load the trains up and but before the inspector could set the seal on the train car he would had come by and make sure that everything was just right because they knew the inspector knew the company hired the inspector to cover their to keep their damages to an absolute minimum or if not eliminate them altogether because they knew that that train would go through areas and maybe come to where they have to make really really hard breaks maybe have to stop really fast and things had to be packed just right yes just like god has things in order he's got steps he's got justification and sanctification and if there's still things or bad habits that are hanging in your life that you haven't been sanctified from god's not going to fill you yet because the train car is still rattling around but once everything you've been cleaned out then the inspector sets the seal on you and when the great inspector sets the seal on you nothing can touch you until you've reached your destination now with the holy ghost satan likes to try and water down the power of the holy ghost with the holy ghost the prophet said we have enough power within us to create a world and go live on it if we ever feel like doing it it's now if i ever felt like creating my own world and going to live on it it's right about now but you know that's not god's perfect will which is why he set a guard there because it's according to your faith and that's not god's plan for us for us to all go create our worlds and go live on it his plan is that we all go with him where he is there may we be also and then we're all going to come back together as the great family of god back to earth again that's his plan but the prophet was making an example of just how powerful the holy ghost is because if the holy ghost if satan can get us to doubt our weapon he's got us wicked no matter how powerful your weapon is no matter how wonderful your armor is if the enemy has got you bluffed until you think of thinking and to get you to think that it's not enough he's got you whipped yet all the angels of god yet all of heaven looks down and sees what you're equipped with in another dimension but yet satan can get a believer in a corner in such a weak state and make you think that your weapon ain't strong enough your weapon is the same weapon that jesus christ had you think he he beat satan with the word every single time and he gives you the exact same weapon to beat the same devil with we're fighting the same devil think of this we're fighting the same devil that jesus did we're fighting the same spirits of phariseeism we're fighting the same spirits of sadducees the same spirits the same holy ghost the same life of christ everything is set still the same it's just the flesh has changed now when you see the order of the scripture jesus is coming to passover and he's coming to passover and he begins the disciples are on the edge of their seats they're waiting on the messiah to kick out all the romans they've got in their own idea of what the messiah is going to do and when jesus comes he's healing the sick he's cast out devils that's great but they've always got a sword somewhere they're waiting for jesus to to take over so jesus begins to lay out the order of events and he begins to say that somebody is going to betray me and that all of you i'm going to be forsaken by all of you and i must go up to jerusalem i must fall into the hands of wicked man i must be crucified and the disciples are having to try without the holy ghost yet they're having to wrap their minds about around all this because they put all their hopes in jesus christ which is a wonderful thing but what they missed was the crucifixion they missed that the holy ghost had to come back so as jesus was beginning to lay all this out they began to get really worried they began to get real sorrowful and that's when peter went ahead and said you know all men forsake you i want in saint john 14 jesus said it's verse 16 and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you that was wonderful but listen how it's about to get better and shall be in you that's better being him being in us is a whole lot better than him being just with us in the body i will not leave you comfortless you talk about some beautiful words he says i won't leave you comfortless the world's without comfort the world is without peace but he says i won't leave you comfortless i will come to you yet just a little while right now they see me they're about to crucify me they're about to stick a spear in my side but he said yet a little while the world won't see me no more he said but you see me who do we see every weekend who do we see in our lives who do we see when we open up the bible who do we see when we go to work who do we see in the car with us who do we feel when we pray the world don't feel that but you feel that because of this because he said the world ain't going to see me no more but you're going to see me and i'm not only going to be with you now i'm not then going to be in you because i live that's key we can't live apart from him he says because i live ye shall live also there would be no holy ghost without a crucifixion there'd be no holy ghost without a resurrection the holy ghost is his is the proof of his resurrection when the pillar of fire would come down and do all their miracles and brother brahms meetings when it when that ministry was ordained to be on the earth it was the holy ghost that did it because it was the same spirit that dwelt in jesus that came that was in his prophet that came down and did the exact same works in john 16 7. nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him to you many times we see weakness in the wrong way weakness is actually strength the disciples were all worried and tore up oh my goodness jesus was we had such a hope when you read in the scriptures when they were on the way to on the road to emmaus they said we had hoped that he would restore the kingdom of israel but here he was crucified what are we going to do peter and john the disciples they were so discouraged they went fishing but it was a time for them to draw strength because god was getting ready to change dispensations when the prophet of god was taken off the scene imagine the discouragement brother matthew that here they were expecting on every single meeting the rapture could come the rapture could come they'd see god manifest expecting the rapture at any time and that's the way we should be at every service but all of a sudden their phone rings and they pick up the prophet has been in an accident how can this be how can this be i thought he was going to be on the earth he made comments that said he hopes that he believes god will let him see the rapture and things how can this be he's in the hospital everybody's praying everybody's praying everybody's praying then all of a sudden christmas eve right there he slips away imagine how discouraged everyone felt i would have felt very discouraged but you find that god ordained it that way because it was time for message believers to quit just looking to him and look at what he said to look at what he said take what he said back to the scripture and see the vindication of the message but when he was here on the earth they were just following the meetings they were overwhelmed by the amount of truth they were receiving but now we've had all these 70 years or 60 70 years time's gone by so fast to look into these things and get ready for the rapture so we're gonna have to be we're gonna be without excuse so that was a time when the bride was in like a moment of weakness that then she began to print the books and really go back and listen to the tapes and really investigate and start eating the book it was god's way but it was it felt like it was just in a moment of weakness he says how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come the holy ghost will lead you and he'll guide you you remember brother went into a factory of a machine shop and he talked about going in at a certain time the bell would ring and all the machinists would hang their aprons up and things and a big magnet would come across and pick up all the shavings the holy ghost is like a magnet magnet has an unseen force and how many as an experiment i remember as a kid you know you'd get a magnet you put on top of a table and you'd get the other magnet and you put it underneath the table and you would move it around and you couldn't see the magnet underneath the table if you weren't the one holding it but yet you could see the effect of the magnet on top of the table brochure as it would move across that's how the holy ghost is it leads us and got us and people can't see it with their physical eyes but yet you can see the movement of it and it leads us and it guides us if we'll just yield to it it'll yield it'll lead you and guide you into all truth it'll lead you and guides you into what job you should get what relationship you should be in it will lead you and guide you see god is the god of detail whenever he created the flowers or or things he didn't just say oh all white it's a lot easier that way oh they'll all just be yellow it's a lot easier there he is a he is a master designer and he's an incredible decorator and he took such care to make sure that that this was this color or or the fish or in any kind of animal create kingdom you want to look into he was so careful the mind of god is so infinite and if he cares that much about his creation how much more does he care about you to be he cares about every single aspect every single hurt you have every single concern there may not be someone else's concern but whatever lays heavy on your heart he cares about he cares and we're sealed in the hand of god we are the bible says that my sheep hear my voice this is jesus's own words and i know them he knows you brother andy he knows what your problems are he knows what's on your mind he knows what bothers you he says and i know them and he even knows us by name you know that would have take a very passionate shepherd they're not just my sheep it's brother davey it's sister cassie it's brother jeff he knows his sheep by name and he knows your name and he knows what you're going through and he knows when you lay your head on your pillow at night what bothers you and he says and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than them all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand satan can't pluck you out of his hand amen because the holy ghost is our portion of god it is our inheritance it belongs to us when god gives you the holy ghost he's literally given you brother matthew a part of himself and it belongs to you you can't give it to someone else you can't you you can't show it to someone else necessarily in a physical way but yeah it's god's inheritance it's god's portion to you it's a part of god that he gives to you and that is why you can never be separated from god how god cannot be separated from himself in fact not only can he not be separated he then says to april becomes obligated to you because remember god is obligated to his word and god proves his word well who's who's his word the bride the word made flesh and god is obligated we as us husbands we're obligated to our wives we are obligated to take care of them and to our families and to nurture them and to make sure they've got footy security shelter all these things that is a natural way because you all understand that god allows marriage in every way in every area and every form to express a spiritual truth that is the whole purpose is that we can experience things in marriage or in a family as an example and it helps us to understand god because god is so far above us we understand him sometimes by natural things we understand whenever we love our spouse like we should we then get an idea of what it must be like for god to love us when if if god forbid the the situation arises where you must provide immediate safety to your family and even if it doesn't lord willing you know you that attribute is in you to immediately at all cost even if it means your own life you protect your family it then gives you an idea of god coming down and giving his life for his family because he refused to be separated from you he refused to have you separated from him rather and the adoption brotherhood says after you have died after you have passed into that land and you're standing there with your loved ones you are still filled with the holy ghost it's yours for eternity it is yours he gives it to you and he doesn't take it back it is yours it belongs to you the holy ghost is a way of god himself saying that i promise you you're going to get a body change the holy ghost is god saying i promise you you're going to overcome well i can't overcome i've got this fault i've got that fault i'm just such a human i know but he's overcoming in you that's why that's not that's why it takes the holy ghost to have that promise to overcome when you have the holy ghost is god promising you're going to see your loved ones that have already gone on because it's already done it's a seal it's finished he said it was finished it's already done he said brother i'm speaking the church book he said now works are fine but they don't save you they don't make you perfect it's christ or perish now this just smacks the the modern religion and modern christianity right in the face and i love it because they try and and say you know oh there's more than one way to this city there's more than one way it's whatever no there's one way there's one way he says it is christ or perish it's not even christ and works it's christ alone he said this age began the years of armenianism that did not believe in christ as a reality it does not sing of nothing but the blood but it sings of nothing but the blood and my own conduct now i believe in good conduct if you are saved you will do righteously we've already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not jesus plus it is jesus alone salvation is of the lord from start to finish it's all god let his life be in me let his blood let it be his blood that cleanses me let it be his spirit that fills me let it be his word in my heart and mouth let it be his stripes that heal me let it be jesus to jesus alone not by works of righteousness which i have done no sir christ in my life because if he walked out of the grave we're going to walk too if the holy ghost that jesus christ had walked out of the grave then the holy ghost that you have is also going to walk out of the grave if the holy ghost that he had changed him and gave him a new body what's it going to do to you it can't do anything different if it's the same holy ghost so it's already done he's already done it he was the first fruits of the resurrection what does that mean that means he was the first one that raised from the dead and then after he raised from the dead the old testament saints raised with him because if he walked out of the grave sister tracy i'm walking out too he ascended up on high 500 people seen them we're going to because if that same spirit that raised christ jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll also quicken your mortal body there's no other way it's finished he's already done it well i can't see it forget looking through your own humanity he's already done it he's a christian not me he's the christian not you but he's living it out through you i'm speaking on a body level on the soul level we are christians but it's him living through us we have nothing to bring to him is what i'm trying to say now we are a triune being we're made in the image of god god is father son holy ghost we're body we're spirit and we're soul now as if you can in your own understanding separate this about yourself it will really help you in your christian walk you have to understand that you're still flesh and blood that you still have a human spirit and then there's a soul in you too and your soul is the real you the body that we see walk in church every weekend is the house you live in but the soul is the real you now there's five senses to our bodies i better look down so i all know them here see taste feel smell and here you've got five well that's your natural body but your human spirit has also got five senses and that's reasoning memory affection conscience and imagination but in your soul there's only two senses one or the other should i say there's only one sense but you the either you're either ruled by faith or you're ruled by doubt so we all as people have the same bodily senses we all feel the same thing if something if something hurt to me more than likely it's going to hurt to you if you hear something then i'm going to hear it if if you find something really sad more than likely i'm going to find that sad because we're humans and we sympathize but in the soul it all depends on who the king of your soul is on who resides in there because in the body and in the spirit is where the human dna that we take from our parents that's where the problem lies we get our physical attributes from our parents or grandparents or it comes down the line in our bodies and then in our human spirits is where we get the spiritual problems from our family dna that's where the temper can be that's where complexes will be that's where hatred or whatever maybe that is in that human spirit and that is the part though that must be overrode by the king of the heart now it takes a born-again experience to keep your other 10 senses in check because just because you're you're born again on your way to heaven but you're still gonna have to fight and you still gotta fight them five senses of the spirit and five senses of the body so it's really one against ten for the born-again christian it's one against ten you talk about being tough you remember brother ram said that faith had hair on the chest and big muscles i don't get nervous sisters that's spiritual big muscles because you have to fight 10 different things at once because remember your soul is can get born again but your body and your human spirit is not born again that is why we still get sick that is why satan will try and attack you with depression and fear and anxiety where is that coming from it's coming from hell but he can't get to your soul because you're sealed so he'll attack your human spirit and he tries to affect your soul through them them avenues because remember the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind now remember the mind battles that you're facing does not define who you are it's what's in the soul that defines who you really are it's it's our attitude toward the word is what defines who we really are as the word comes forth when we hear the word it don't matter if it's through a minister it doesn't matter if it's through a tape it doesn't matter when we read the bible it goes into our minds first and the prophet of god said we have free moral agency to accept it or to refuse it when the word comes forth and it's uh it's even a battle in church because what do i mean it's a battle well one good example is the word goes forth you can be healed in jesus name you can be saved in jesus name the holy ghost is for you all these promises that are constantly spoken and preached but satan will come in and say it's not for you you send away your day of grace if you would you know i you thought that so now you don't qualify for this it's the devil it's a battle and it's going on right here so when we hear the word preach we're to receive the words but it's not to just stay here that's called mental faith it's not to stay here it is to drop within our hearts and when it drops within our hearts then it becomes a revelation then it becomes unshakable then it becomes unmovable that's how the word is received you receive the word by accepting the word and not just remember that parable jesus said people go out the door and they let the fowls of the air come and take it they let the chokes of the world choke it out it becomes unfruitful but when it lands on good ground where's the good ground it's in your heart that's where the good ground is as long as it just stays in our mind that that don't scare the devil but let it be in your heart let it then it becomes a reality and then it becomes part of your life and then when satan comes and tries to attack you through your human spirit because remember memory satan will come back to you and he'll try and remind you of what you've done whenever wherever you are but he doesn't tell you he's the one that made you do it he was the one that was that influenced you rather so he'll try and use your memory against you he'll try and use all of these avenues and then bring you in the house of god with conviction you can't do that you've got to come to the house of god saying lord i'm justified it's as though i've never even done it in the first place the blood that was years ago that doesn't matter but satan will use the memory to affect he'll be trying to use your memory or trying to use your imagination or anything those are see the god created them senses of the spirit but as soon as they cross the word you rebuke them you say you're prayed for and you believe that god's going to heal you and it's a revelation in your heart but yet you can still feel the pain pain is real and it takes some faith to be there and be hurting so bad but yet god's word says that you're healed you feel it your natural sense fills it that's a battle but god put something in you to overcome that because satan works on these senses and he works on every single christian and he'll come on them inlets and he'll try and attack you like i said with depression just out of nowhere he'll try and attack you with fear and anxiety like what in the world's going on but you have something on this on the throne room you've got something in your soul that can rise above and say get thee behind me satan that's not me that's not my thought that's not my reasoning that's not me i'm sealed and satan is jealous that he can't get in there he can't touch you but he tries to get you to doubt your position and keep you leaving a defeated life it's not god's will for you to live a defeated life it's not god's will for you to feel defeated because remember the holy ghost in a believer's soul is just as eternal as god is because it is god your flesh our flesh has an end our human spirit has an end but the holy ghost in you never had a beginning so we can never have an end because remember it's zoe it's god's own life that is why the entire christian principle is based on rest different denominations they believe that the evidence of the holy ghost is keeping at the sabbath day god's rest the holy ghost is our rest because we now have quit trying we've quit it's not him it's not it's not i that live but it's he that liveth in me ain't that what jesus said that's the testimony of the bride you as a christian i as a christian you as a christian can do anything you want do you know that he said bless god i'm gonna go get drunk then christian you're not a christian because as a christian be very careful here for the record i'm calling the prophet if you don't realize that he said i can do anything i want. so if you have the holy ghost you don't want to get drunk if you have the holy ghost you don't want to tell a lie you don't want to sin you want to do what's right so you do what you want if you feel bound then you're being religious there's freedom in the holy ghost there's freedom you do what you want you don't have to be arrested for it unless a real maybe day of pentecost breaks out and they arrested them but you understand what i'm saying as a christian you can do anything you want because nothing you desire to do is going to be out of here out of the bounds of here it's all going to be in here you know when they when the flesh and human spirit drop away this is a very serious subject here only the soul is what appears before god so what you have is you have people remember brother adam told the story about daniel greene he had a dream he was an evangelist on the earth and he won people to jesus christ and he dreamed that he died and he had approached the throne and everything and they couldn't find his name on the role and they sent him to the to the throne of judgment judgment throne now this is just a dream and he said that the voice that was speaking to him in this light he approached his life and he said the voice that was speaking to him said daniel greene did you ever lie and daniel green in his mind he said he thought he was a good fellow and he never lied but he said in the presence of that light he remembered some things that he said that weren't just right and he had no choice but to tell the truth because he knew that light knew he said yeah lord i did and then that voice came out and said did you ever steal and he said i thought i was an honest man he said but in the presence of that light i remember pulling some deals that just weren't quite right and he had no choice but to tell the truth so he said yes lord i did and remember he said that right when he expected to hear a boom and voice they depart into everlasting punishment he said he felt a hand come on his shoulder and he said lord and it was the face of jesus and he said it's true though daniel green did some things that that weren't right he said but daniel green also stood for me so what we take away from that is that the mental senses when they see reasoning you remember the story of that woman that brother bran tells and she was in in the church i don't remember if it was his or not but she did she did some things and went and got remarried and and did some things and went and took a very horrible road and brother were trying to reach out to her and she just refused it and said some blasphemous things and she went and joined some denominational church and she was told she was okay and on her way to heaven and she was a sunday school teacher and she had all this sin on her that she wouldn't repent of well a venero disease caught up with her because of the way that she was living and on her deathbed her mental faculties begin to kind of break up all the reasoning all all the senses of her spirit all the fronts that she had well i'm okay because my pastor said i'm okay because of this i'm okay because of this the mental faculties began to break apart and when the mental faculties began to break apart she then seen herself as a soul before god and then she realized that she was lost her soul brother ram said caught up with her see she was meeting god on the condition of her soul not her body or or or the pastor patting her on the back telling her what a good person she was she was meeting god on the basis of her soul and she realized she was lost and when they called the pastor in he kept encouraging her encouraging the doctors to keep pumping her full of painkillers and things and she died with saying i'm lost i'm lost i'm lost because the mental faculties begin to break apart and you have all these atheists and people that have left the message that are fighting the message right now they've got reasoning they've got they've got the mental faculties but wait till they start breaking apart wait before they've got to meet god as a soul in the presence of that light wait before they have to answer in the presence of that light and they can't deny it no matter what happens though now here's the wonderful rest that we have as believers because the holy ghost is a seal and our soul is sealed sometimes satan is very vicious and sometimes when people start slipping away and it's their time their mind will start slipping their bodies start slipping but yet no matter what they may think in their minds and all of a sudden just start slipping their soul is sealed it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if satan starts attacking them right he's got a punch coming so if on someone's death they begin to just really just all of a sudden start really slipping in their mind as i said and maybe sometimes people can even say harsh things it's their soul is once it's sealed it's sealed god don't take the holy ghost back because god god's uh covenant is unconditional aren't you glad to be serving a god that's unconditional no matter in your bad moods and your good moods and your because again back to the senses you're not going to feel saved every day you're not going to feel like jumping up and down every single day you're not going to feel like praising god every single day but yet in the midst of the storm the soul which is the boss takes control and you praise him in the middle of your storm when satan makes you feel like you're just the worst sinner in the city you say satan i don't care i have the holy ghost and i'm gonna believe what god's word says about me not what my mood says which comes and goes not what other people say it's what your word says about me that is our anchor despite of what your emotions go because your emotions can go in any which way how you feel may go in any which way it can go in any direction amen the prophet of god didn't said he didn't feel saved every day it's not how you feel we take the basis of what he said you say oh i'm you you know we're in church and we're praising the lord i don't i really don't feel like raising my hands raise them anyway that's not being hypocrite that's not being hypocritical that's saying flesh you're gonna get in line you don't feel like it but i'm gonna praise the lord anyway i don't you're satan is trying to make me feel like i don't feel like singing but i'm gonna sing anyway why because there's a boss on the throne room of your heart that gets your body under subjection that makes you that makes you brothers us brothers turn our heads that makes us sisters watch not watch the the wrong thing on the internet not post the wrong thing on facebook or whatever it may be because you've got you've got somebody on your throne that brings your body under subjection when you in your body you may feel like doing something you may not feel like doing something but your your soul takes preeminence and brings the body under subjection when somebody cuts you off and you just ready to go for that horn it's okay it was there for a reason but we bring our bodies under subjection we bring our human spirit under subjection you feel like flying off the handle because something just really upset you bring that spirit under subjection amen bring it under subjection god equipped you for that but god makes his covenant unconditional brother graham teaches us about abraham he made an unconditional covenant with abraham and then he goes and he tells the story about how when abraham went and abraham asked god to confirm the covenant there and he he told them to what animals to take and how to divide them apart and to and then the pillar of fire went between the animals you remember you can find that in genesis 15. and god made this covenant with abraham unconditional and brother bran then comes along and he brings about how on the orientals about how they would make a covenant and how they would stand between these dead beasts and they said they'd make an agreement they'd make a sacrifice and to tear the beast apart and they're divided and they said let our bodies be as this beast if we don't keep that was a serious covenant then brother tells us a story about the chinese laundry men when they would come and they came to america and they couldn't couldn't read or couldn't write and so all they knew but they were great at laundry so all they could do is they'd rip the paper in a certain way and that's how you'd go pick up your laundry brother brand picks that up and he says because jesus christ is our unconditional covenant jesus christ is our relation to god and god's relation to us jesus was torn apart on calvary his body went to heaven and his spirit came back on the earth came back to the church on the day of pentecost picks that up he says watch god was then in spirit how could god be tore apart but one day god was made flesh and dwelt among us the lord jesus christ the emmanuel and then there at calvary the covenant god wrote with us he took the christ to calvary and tore him apart soul embody and he took up his body and set it at the right hand of his majesty and sent the spirit back on earth to make a covenant to carry out the gospel and the same dovetail power that jesus christ had he's the same yesterday today and forever and the church is given a covenant and the covenant is the baptism of the holy ghost which is the seed of abraham bring him to us then god making this covenant that every man that's called into the grace of god by the holy ghost has the same promise that abraham had of eternal life i made this a little illustration of a covenant this is like jesus christ and he's on the earth and the bible says that all the fullness of the god godhead bodily dwelt in him he was god from beginning to end and evermore he was not one spec human in on that level he became flesh to experience the things that we experience he became a man because it takes a man a kinsmen redeemer had to purchase our salvation a kinsmen redeemer had to shed his blood when melchizedek came to abraham he spoke that body in existence and he spoke that body out of existence but melchizedek didn't come in that form to give his life for us he came to confirm the covenant to abraham and he did his work and god just breathed that body he stepped in the angels did it breathed and it was gone but with jesus he became a man he came and he was born in a nasty barn he was a super sign he came to experience the disappointment he came to experience the loss of his best friend he came to experience sickness he came to experience a headache he came to experience all them things so he fulfilled his work and when he fulfilled his work just like abraham was abraham took them sacrifices and and tore them apart and we just read the quote what brother adam said about jesus when he when they nailed him to a cross they then whenever he whenever they stuck that spirit in his side and he said it is finished god tore his covenant god tore his covenant apart and you see how that says jesus but when he tear it apart it takes two to make him so his body went up and is on the right hand of the father but on the day of pentecost he sent his spirit the holy ghost in the believer in the individual and it is to indwell us because remember he said now i'm with you but he said i'm gonna be in you so when and people wonder how jesus prayed to himself well if you have this on the inside of you how do you pray to him so the holy ghost-filled believer is walking around with this brother danny they have the covenant they've got the other half they've got everything that he had they've got let's see i ran out of room with the things to write on here joy it's in you faith it's there it's not far off it's in you but as long as satan can keep just throwing something over it throwing something over and trying and trying to keep it snuff snuffed out and you're not living up to your potential you're not living to to where you're called to live he's trying to throw dirt on you a sound mind in this mind age we need a sound mind people are crazy and i i i'm not saying that in the wrong way but they are hell has come up we went into uh i don't mean to get off on this but we went to walmart the other day for the first time in a long time i actually physically go in i don't recommend it i i don't recommend it they don't have a sound mind but god has promised this to you i think there was more colored hair in there than there is on on that color wheel or something or maybe they each have their own color wheel i'm not sure but you've got peace you've got a sound mind you know that could be us if it wasn't for the grace of god i'm not trying to say that our flesh is so we're better than them no it's it's praise be to god it's praise god it's sad it's you know it's that way because they rejected this message it's that way because they rejected the word that's why we have the solution and god help us to be a light and we will gladly witness to anyone of the hope that lies within us i'm just trying to make the point of how dark it is out there but he you've got a sound mind it's in the holy ghost for you healing is there overcoming power love meekness gentleness long suffering temperance temperance goodness your body change it's all in here the resurrection because remember as they sang that wonderful song if he walked out of the grave with this then if i've got part of it and you've got part of it then you're walking out too because you're a part of him this this looks weird by itself don't it this don't look complete he's not complete without you because you're holding the other half so whenever you put the two together look how look how great that is not my artwork but look how wonderful him coming together we're bone of his bone we're flesh of his flesh we're spirit of a spirit if that same spirit same one it's not some third person or some second person it's the person of jesus christ living in you then sister caitlin you can overcome every devil that he did saints you were fighting the same devil you can overcome the same devil you can have the same authority because remember if one spoonful of the ocean is the same chemical that's in the rest of the ocean and you hold the other one so when the great magnet of the holy ghost comes over on resurrection morning and every person that was buried that went into the grave holding this now they're in their theophany they're on the other side but for the sake of illustration when that great magnet comes over there's gonna be a resurrection because it fits because the same life that was in him was in them it's still in them because remember there are loved ones that have already passed over they're enjoying the blessings of god they're enjoying the fruits of their labor they're enjoying the fruits of the battle they're enjoying the spoils of war if you will that's not sacrilegious to say they're enjoying that now so when they on resurrection morning they're gonna rise up and they're going to meet it and it's going to be a dovetail i'm not a carpenter whatsoever but dovetail from my understanding on cabinets or any on on furniture whenever it fits a joint and that's how this fits your the spirit that's in you not your human spirit now remember this is on the level of the soul around this you got the five senses of your human spirit which is can be sticky you've got the five senses of your mortal body which will try and your own body your own human spirit will try and challenge you on what on this but that is where the soul is able that is where the holy ghost on the inside of you is able to overcome all ten senses if if the sight agrees with it bless god god gave us sight god gave us all these senses but see it's not redeemed yet so satan enters that's his channels that's how he tries to come and fight us is through our mortal senses but we hold the covenant that is why every person with the holy ghost has this within them the bride collectively has this so when the bride collectively as a whole those that are resurrected those that are alive and remain whenever she ascends because remember going to meet him in the air it's going to be a perfect fit the ministry that jesus had when he was on the earth and he met the woman at the well countless other ones when he went and he would cast out evil spirits when he would heal the sick when he would raise the dead he did all them works you can we read it in our bibles and we believe every one of them whenever he ascended upon high and he sent the holy ghost them disciples and apostles that had this in them did the exact same works whenever god sent a prophet with the ministry of jesus christ the son of man ministry he did the exact same thing with this part in fact he said that god did more through his ministry than eve was even recorded in the bible so it's the same ministry these signs shall follow them that believe my name they shall cast out devils if he did it you can do it the works that i do shall you do also with this this isn't half the power this is the same power but just in a smaller form it's the same amount you've got just as much you've got authority over the devil because you hold this you hold that's your covenant and that belongs to you and no matter what that will always be yours brother vernon that will always belong to you god don't say okay you're done you made a mistake i'm taking this back no he gave it to you he sealed you with it this is your seal and it will take you through this life's journey your body change everything is in this because she is him he says if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him you're miss jesus christ whenever you go to the altar and you get married and they pronounce you mr and mrs so and so and the bride takes on the name of the love of her life she beams with joy she beams with beauty she beams with gladness because all of her hopes she's put in this man all of her trust she's put in this man all of her confidence and her future and family and and being provided for and security she's put in this man that's how the bride is that's why we should be the happiest people on earth because everything we have need of he's taken care of it's him he's living the word through you you can't live this word within yourself you can't be a christian by yourself you keep falling you keep falling you keep trying you keep trying it takes him you say i've got the holy ghost and i still make mistakes yeah we all do but this will pick you back up this right here will say lord i'm sorry i did not mean to do that just don't let the devil make you think his thoughts are your thoughts don't let him do that because he loves doing that he loves whispering behind your ear and and and giving you the wrong idea or giving you the wrong thoughts making you reason or whatever and then coming up front and saying you're just an awful person i can't believe you just thought that i can't believe that you were reasoning that and you call yourself a christian and he'll go back behind you and start whispering in your ear and it's the same devil that gave you the thought that's then accusing you you talk about a devil but we serve a god that can deliver the holy ghost is vital and i'm gonna try and bring this to a close but the holy ghost is vital jesus said you must be born again you've got to it's not i should it'd be a good idea to make my life easier to make my parents like me more and make my wife like me more my husband no you must be born again you must [Applause] say how do i know if i have the holy ghost let's cover that how do i know that i have the holy ghost in second corinthians 5 17 paul said therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are becoming new now this is not sanctification this is not just god cleansing you and that's a work of grace but see whenever you're trusting god for the holy ghost and he justifies you and then god sanctifies you whenever in the middle of your week don't get your mind on the things of the world and we all have things we have to do but don't go out and left field and expect to just live from week in a weekend stay in the atmosphere of the holy ghost stay in the atmosphere of the word and then god will draw near to you because whenever god accepts your faith god is obligated to give you the holy ghost he's obligated because god is obligated to his word says that so there is a genuine evidence of the holy ghost he's never told me anything wrong yet that is it is the evidence of the holy ghost is he who can believe the word you can receive it now there's a difference between just believing it there's lots of people with a with with a beer bottle on their hands that look at the message and say i can't live it that's the truth a cigarette in their hands i can't live it but that's that that's the truth i believe that brother brown was a prophet that's not receiving the word that's not even hearing the word hearing means to understand so whenever the word when you have the holy ghost the word comes to you brother stephen it comes to you it finds you just like that mama eagle went searching for that egg that she laid and it finds you and you're able to receive the word and when you receive the word it then lives through you because you receive it on the level of your soul and then all of a sudden you're not trying to work from the outside in you're not trying to to to get sober and and go to alcoholics anonymous or go here or go there and read and once i get to this stage it's not that's religion that's just on the level of the human spirit but you receive the word in your soul and it will change you you receive the word in your soul and then it begins to push out into your human spirit and then it begins to push out in your body then your body does line up with the word then it's not so hard for for ladies to to lay down pants or or men to to wear pants for men to wear pants and for ladies to wear dresses it's not hard because then they receive the word in their souls and it begins to push out but we don't but if there was someone here that walked in off the street and and and a woman had pants we wouldn't be up here you should be ashamed of yourself you should be ashamed of yourself we would try and introduce her to jesus christ and let him do it he'll teach her he'll bring her on if there's a new birth it will come about to be it will come to be we don't sit here we're not religious we want to we're you know we want to introduce people to jesus christ fall in love with jesus fall in love with his word and all these other things will be added unto you the same can apply to doctrine don't get so overwhelmed and oh i don't understand the 70 weeks i don't understand the thunder let the word is simple it's man that complicates things so the bible said that he'd lead you and guide you into all truth so we introduce people to jesus christ he is the word i promise you when that born again when that new birth takes place in the soul it'll take care of everything else it's not stop doing this stop doing that stop doing that it's not religion it's not commandments that's not how god runs this house what did jesus say if you love me you'll keep my commandments if this sounds silly but if if god's requirement is that we stand in our head for the holy ghost there'd be some head standing you know as an example if god if god would require us to do something on being extreme to make you to get us to understand that it's whatever god wants i'll do if he said be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ that's what we'll do because that's what he said because we love him he said brother i'm saying a think of man's filter now if you want the evidence of the holy ghost there it is when that soul of yours will line up with the word of god in every respect it shows that you've drawled your life through the think commands filter god's filter when we hear the word and we see and that's why we come to church one of the reasons is to see where we fall short and the minister gets up on the pulpit and god anoints him and he's preaching he's speaking and you realize lord i i don't pray as often as i should you know or or man i haven't been like i should be god uses that and we go and we say lord help me with this i realize that i'm actually not quite i'm you know i'm still a christian but i'm not quite where i should be i need to come up a step higher i need a fresh revival in my home or where i need a fresh revival in my own life or whatever it is that's lining up with the word because if you have growth that shows there's life before you can have growth you've got to have life because remember grace is what god did for us and works is what we do for him that's why we don't works is wonderful paying people's hospital bills or or donating or doing this and that that's just in the human spirit that doesn't merit salvation there's not one thing we can do to merit salvation remember paul said though i give my body to be burned as a sacrifice and all these things and though i have not charity i'm nothing that's right christians do them things but that's not how you merit salvation you marry you can't merit salvation you receive salvation by accepting it see how simple that is people you think of all the millions of dollars that people spend and organizations and churches spend to try and merit something amen the only way we'll ever get to heaven is because of what he's done for us and our faith in that remember god abraham believed god and his faith in god was counted to him for righteousness but not only now believing is wonderful but god said abraham you believe me there's your righteousness it's accounted to you for righteousness but i'm going to show that i accepted you by giving you the seal of circumcision and that is how god proves to you that he has accepted your faith is when he gives you the holy ghost you say how do i get it that's a wonderful hungry question how do you get the holy ghost because you need the holy ghost to be in a rapture if you don't if you don't have this in you then when this comes down you don't have nothing to meet you can't meet the head if you're not in the body and the only way to get in the body is by one spirit one spirit so whenever you have this you're then a candidate for the rapture no matter all the you see all the mistakes you're we're looking at the flesh you're looking at your human spirit there's always that you're gonna have that until our bodies are changed look at this because this is the word this is the part that god deposited in you and that's what we look to so without this then you're not part of the covenant now we're not born with the holy ghost we predestinated but yet we come to the earth with a nature a simple nature we don't come on the earth with no holy ghost we come with the sinful nature we have the desire for the things of the world we have a thirst for the things of the world no one has to teach us how to lie cheat still amen we already know that because of our first birth but because ye are sons and daughters of god because god did slip the ring of predestination on your finger before the foundation of the world you had the ability to receive something that the world knows nothing about you have the ability to receive the holy ghost so because you're predestinated god then at the time of the new birth you're filled with the holy ghost you're sealed in the kingdom of god satan can't take you out nobody can take you out you're sealed until the day of your redemption so in closing how do i get the holy ghost like everything else in god's word is very simple in acts 2 38 2 37 and when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do this how do we get this holy ghost then peter said unto them see peter had the holy ghost at this point so he could tell others how to get it and peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost we can stand musicians can come for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call if you repented and you've been baptized in the name of jesus christ stay under the atmosphere of the holy ghost keep praying for it it's a promise that's right in acts chapter 10 and peter in 10 34 then peter opened his mouth and said of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him the word which god sent to the children of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord of all that word i say ye know which was published throughout all judea and begin from galilee and after the baptism which john preached how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with them and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree him god raised up the third day and showed him openly not to all people but unto witnesses chosen before of god even to us who who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead and he commanded us to preach into the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of the quick and the dead to him gave all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive the remission of sins while peter yet spake these words that i was just reading amen the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word amen it's in scripture orders in perfect scripture order to receive the word while the holy while the word is going forth don't miss your moment reach out god can feel with the holy ghost right where you're sitting you could have desired it for years and years months and months cried and went to the altar and everything else but yet right where you're sitting god could give you the holy ghost right where you're sitting god can give you a refilling of the holy ghost because it's a promise when paul passed through the upper coast of ephesus he said have you received the holy ghost since he believed not when since [Music] they might have been in church for decades they might have been in service after service after service they might have believed everything paul said their messenger but he said have ye received the holy ghost since you believed our opening text in ephesians was in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise you have the holy s if you have the holy ghost in your soul there's not a devil in hell that can touch you don't matter what he whispers in your ear it don't matter what mind battles he tries to give you it don't matter you're sealed he can't touch you you're on your way to a body change why because he walked out of the grave you're walking too he walked into a new body you're gonna walk too because if that same spirit if that same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwell in you it'll also quicken your mortal bodies [Music] we can't look at our mistakes if we've experienced that new birth we've got to look at what he said about us if we haven't received a new birth we must [Music] we must be born again when the word when there when there's things in our lives they don't quite line up like it should when there's when there's failures and faults and and things and we all like to say we all have them but when when there's major things in the life that really god really needs to to take care of he promised the holy ghost service after service the spirit is always so willing so willing to pour out his spirit to deliver to heal but it's got to go from from our minds to our hearts brothers and sisters may you be encouraged may you be encouraged to either seek the holy ghost like you've never sought it before and seek the new birth and cry out to god and follow the order of the scripture and then he's under obligation to fill you he's under obligation god can't lie we talk all the time about what god can do but there's something he can't do he can't lie he can't go back on his word he is obligated to his word if he said it and we follow in that scriptural order we've got to get the same results because he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen let's buy our heads and our hearts the gracious heavenly father lord how we love you and how we thank you lord jesus for these moments in divine presence or even though it's warm and lord it's getting late father we just thank you for these moments lord we're here talking about eternal life lord we're speaking of eternal life and you made it possible lord by about what you did two thousand years ago lord you said it is finished it doesn't matter what the enemy says it doesn't matter what the great accuser doesn't matter even what our own senses tell us we look to the word we look to the word father lord and that's what we're trusting we're resting on that we're riding on that lord jesus lord it's not our own merits it's not what we can do it's not what we've done it's not how good we may think we are it's about what you've done and we just simply accept it we say yea lord and amen you did that for me i accept it i believe it you said that in your word about me i accept it i believe it and i receive it and we walk in that consciousness we ask lord jesus that you just go lord and may your spirit search over every soul draw us near to you lord as we see these evil days lord they're just climax and lord and sometimes we just don't even see how we can last another day but lord every person lord that you had on your mind for the foundation of the world will be there every person will be quickened by the new birth and we just pray lord jesus if there's any one lord by the way of the internet by way even in this lord holy place tonight father lord if there's any one lord that hasn't had that new birth may you deal with him lord it's a promise you're so willing father we love you lord we commit ourselves into your hands we thank you for your presence your word in the lovely name of jesus amen [Music] okay [Music] my [Music] oh how we need your touch once the again spirit [Music] oh
