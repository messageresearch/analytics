help [Music] the middle of my storm amen i'm so thankful that he's got us his children by his hands to know that he is upholding us by his right hand of power leading us through the night what a what an honor it is to have him in the middle of our storms holding us up and bringing us before the father and taking us by the hand and leading us through i remember one time when i was i was facing some real inner battles and just you know how the enemy faces you and he battles in your mind things and i was facing some real things and the enemy was just trying to whisper lies in our ears and i mean you know how he does it's what he does best and the spirit of the lord came and spoke through a man and i was standing right in that corner and he and he spoke and said i've had you in my hands the whole time and to know that that god has had each and every one of us in his hands the whole time our whole life and to think about the things that we've went through we can look back over our lives and think about the things that we're facing now and realize that our life is in his hands what a wonderful wonderful god that we have we so appreciate him for being our father we're so thankful for our earthly mothers this day we're certainly wishing each and every one of you mothers if you were here today in this service after this service we would normally be handing you a flower or some type of goodie but we're not able to do that today but we are wishing you all a very happy mother's day today and we wish it to be the best but not only this day but every day and we realize that mothers are the fifth gospel when when when they're not in when your children are not in church they're being you as a mother are preaching to them at home and leading them in the fear and admonition of the lord so that's what a wonderful privilege that mothers have been given to be the in-house preacher to to instruct the children in the home and so we're certainly wishing you all a very happy mother's day and if you have not wished your mother a mother a happy mother's day no matter how difficult it is it's still the right thing to do no matter how bad the situation is wish your mother a happy mother's day we're certainly certainly thankful for the news we got this past week some of you have seen it by the way of social media or whatnot but brother ron we told you last weekend that brother ron was due for for a brain scan on tuesday we asked for a good report and we got a good report brother ron this scan was on tuesday there and they told him that they did not need to see him for three months and so we say thank you jesus and we're expecting the same thing on tomorrow morning asking for a supernatural god to show up and he's the god that created the the entire being and so we're just asking that he would take control over over brother ron's body and completely clear the scans and made the x-ray of the holy spirit just over oversee him and minister life to him we cursed the enemy the life of it and we've told that enemy where he belongs and where he is to go and we have committed this need before the lord and when we commit something to the lord we don't take it back out of his hands we leave it there so we just want to be remembering brother ron tomorrow it is a very big day in brother ron's life and in each and every one of your lives because we understand the circumstances of things but we have prayed we have asked for a miracle our theme this year has been god is with us and we will see miracles and i believe that we have to me tuesday was a miracle to see that you know we've had 19 weeks of bad news brother ron got up as a champion last weekend on on ring the bell and he rung the devil's bell last weekend and then god came behind it with an amen and gave him a clear report so we're asking that god would come behind this and give a clear report we know that he's god and you know that he's more than able i would like to thank brother allen this morning for stepping up to the plate and being the song leader for us this morning brother alden is one of these days probably going to kill me for all the things that i've put him through i have done i've put in some situations before and uh i'm certainly privileged to have brother alden as it's no secret he's one of my best friends and one of my closest friends in confidants and and uh i i've been blessed on this earth to have brother out and as my friend and and the deacon here at this church to to oversee to be the police officer in the church and god has blessed this church to have brother alden and we can never thank him or his family enough they to my my opinion the fraser family has a legacy because men have stepped up to the plate and so god bless you brother alden and sister tracy we we see their legacy standing before us today singing and praying and we see god's blessings on their lives so at this time we know that uh many of you know the governor has of virginia has made his statement that he is planning a phase one of reopening on may the 15th and so i know that many of you have questions and so i have written along with brother ron i have written a letter and put these things together and we will be putting this letter on the church website and sending it out to you via the church text messaging route and so we just want to present these things to you we know that he is opening it next weekend or next friday but we feel to err on the side of caution and we want to be very diligent in these things we have prayed and put much consideration in these things and so we don't want to come back next weekend but tentatively we want to come back the weekend following that uh the date will be may the 23rd and may the 24th but i'm going to read you this letter because i know that many times in reading sometimes you miss things so i want to read it audibly to you and then we will present it to you again next weekend so lord willing tentatively we will have uh this this service and next service will be our last services alone here with the the few chosen and uh so we just read you this letter to you this morning uh dear full gospel lighthouse tabernacle church family we have certainly missed being able to assemble ourselves together according as the bible has taught us to do so in hebrews 10 and 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching although we have been grateful for the opportunity to greet you and bring forth the preaching of the word via live stream truly it has been a blessing of the lord for many locally and around the world even those who are not believers have been tuning in as of now the government is introducing a phase one of reopening the state and easing the restrictions on gatherings and asking for 50 capacity of gatherings at churches again we do not believe that this is a religious persecution that necessitates a need to defy our government's request as they try to contain this virus we want to do our part and make sure that we don't increase the spread of this virus in our congregation nor hurt our assembly in any way health-wise nor affect anybody's in employment brother ron and myself have came up with these guidelines for us to try and resume services in a safe manner these guidelines may seem difficult and different but we are looking for a safe way for us to attend services in person we are trusting this is only for a couple weeks until we can once again resume a sense of normalcy in our services the following are recommendations and guidelines that we would like to ask for your teamwork in trying to abide with social distancing and at the same time give us a opportunity to attend at least one service a week in person first of all we would like to ask you not to come to church if you or anyone in your family are sick or having symptoms of coughing running nose fever or sore throat we ask during this time that there be no shaking of hands nor hugging anyone during this time as paul has said to us to salute the brethren when you arrive at church we will have the outside and sanctuary doors propped open so no one has to open or close them the deacons or ushers will seat you in the sanctuary in order to mainta maintain social distancing six feet apart you will be you will be seated with your entire family you may not be able to sit in your normal location in the sanctuary as the ushers will seat you accordingly any of your belongings that you have may have left here during this this uh time that we've not been able to gather any of your belongings that you may have left at church such as blankets bags toys etc your camping gear will be moved to the back near the tape library for you to grab and take with you once leaving the service so we will we will put all of those things at the back for you to grab uh two weeks from now and as you take them because other people will be sitting in the seats that you set in when you came if you can take them with you when you leave would be greatly appreciated the local and state authorities have recommended that we wear face masks or coverings while gathering we would like to ask everyone that has their own face covering to wear it when coming to the services if you do not have a face covering we will provide you with one before entering the church please wear the face mask until you are seated in the sanctuary the decision to leave your face mask or covering on in the sanctuary during services will left be left to up to each individual at your own discretion we will have multiple hand sanitizing stations set up and as always please wash your hands please wash your hands please wash your hands with trying to maintain social distancing due to the size of our congregation we can only accommodate a certain amount of people in the sanctuary therefore we will have half of our congregation attend on saturday night at 7 00 p.m and the other half on sunday morning at 11 a.m attentively we plan to start these in-person services on saturday may the 23rd and sunday may the 24th on saturday nights we'd like those who normally sit on the right-hand side as you enter the sanctuary to attend this is the side that brother vernon frazier and brother joe shifflet on which would be to my left but as your right as you enter the building on sunday mornings those who normally sit on the left hand side as you enter the sanctuary to attend this is the side that brothers shannon shifflett and brother ald and fraser set on this will give us adequate space to place everyone six feet away from our congregants also the musicians sound technicians and their families can attend both services if they feel comfortable enough to do so it would be greatly appreciated we are asking that there be no congregating in the vestibule bathrooms nurseries front porch or parking lot before or after services after the service is over the deacons ushers will dismiss the congregation by rolls back to front to allow everyone to dismiss to their cars even on the outside of church we asked for there to be no kind of congregating we again we ask that there be no shaking the hands nor hugging anyone during this time as paul said to salute the brethren we will receive the tithes and offerings by letting each row come forward one at a time and placing them in the offering plates at the altar we will not be having saturday kids choir nor adult or young adult choir until further notice and although we are opening our church services in this manner if for any reason you do not feel safe or comfortable to return at this time we totally understand the decision will be left up to you and as an individual and at your own discretion the services will continue to be streamed via the church website and youtube channel finally we want to encourage you all to remember our brothers and sisters in christ during this season what a great time for us as the bride of jesus to bind our hearts together in christian love and faith and lift up the needs that we are facing as a church and a nation and the conclusion of the matter is that god is with us and we are seeing miracles god bless you brother ron and brother andrew the grace of our lord jesus be with you all amen so thank you for bearing with me we just wanted to bring those things to your attention this weekend again no service next weekend but the weekend following attentively we are planning to have services on may the 23rd and may the 24th saturday night seven o'clock and sunday morning at 11 o'clock amen god bless you this morning let's let's sing this maybe we could sing that song the manger manger of my heart as we get ready to go to the word this morning we just want to prepare our hearts for the the speaking of the word and just want to continue this thought that we've spoken to you on before on committed we just want to our hearts to to be his and not our own nor anyone else we want our hearts to be his it was a tiny simple stable all beaten and worn hardly a place for a king to be born he didn't choose some place special to reveal his majesty so i know if i'll give him control he'll be born in me let your word be born in the manger of my heart [Music] of clay [Music] [Music] i'm nothing not much to behold unlikely the place for his word to unfold but if i'll just shield this very soul and let him have his way from glory unto glory he'll change me day by day let your word be born in the manger of my heart [Music] live inside this house [Music] amen if you have your bibles this morning we want to turn over into the book of isaiah chapter 14 and verse 24. isaiah chapter 14 and verse 24. i would like to speak to you by the help of the lord on committed committed to the purpose amen isaiah chapter 14 and verse 24 and before we before we read the word this morning let's let's speak to the author of his holy word heavenly father we come before your your great throne of mercy this morning expressing lord from our heart how much you mean to us lord as your children father we could never we can never express it father in any way humanistically standing i don't under i don't understand or i can't grasp a way to be able to express it father lord i could tell you i love you all day long and i still don't feel like that would be enough but lord again i want to tell you how much i love you you mean so much to me whether at the end of this road of life if you would tell me to be departed and enter in father i would still serve you no matter what the outcome of this life may come i would still serve you father lord you've been so good to me you have blessed my family you bless me our church father you have blessed us as individuals you have blessed us to be able to he be a hearer of the word god we love you lord and today we just want to get ourselves out of the way lord set down in a corner as it were and let you use this veil of flesh father to be able to speak to your children lord one more time lord jesus we we so appreciate this opportunity to greet him in the name of the lord but we pray that today that not only in this tabernacle but in the tabernacle of their flesh and in their home may they sense the nearness of the holy spirit and may you speak to them lit to ear father we know that this coronavirus has has caused a lot of indifference in our life but lord we have seen you in it and lord we just want to be mindful of the things of god today mind full of time mindful of the people and mind mindful mothers we pray god you bless each and every one of them bless our pastor lord bless bless him anoint him abundantly let your healing virtue flow through his body bringing a complete restoration to him now father we ask god do you have your way in this service we love and appreciate you today in the name of the lord jesus christ and the church and the bride says amen here and at home isaiah chapter 14 and verse 24. now the bible says here the lord of hosts hath sworn saying surely as i have thought so shall it come to pass and as i have purposed so shall i stand that i will break the assyrian in my land and upon my mountains tread him under foot then shall his yoke depart from off them and is burdened apart from off their shoulders notice this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations for the lord of hosts hath purposed and who shall disannoy it who shall who shall turn it away who shall reject it and his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back may god bless the reading of the word you may be seated this morning committed to the purpose no matter how little you are or nor how big you are how important you are or how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose just as my finger is here for a purpose my nail finger my nail on my finger is for a purpose my eye and every part of our body is to serve a purpose and it was not put here just to see what it would look like when it was put here but it was put here to serve its purpose it was god's divine plan to do so and if we were put here for a purpose then there is nothing that can destroy us until god's purpose is fulfilled nothing can harm us until that purpose that god has put us here for has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have how much heartaches or sorrows that we go through all of these are reasons and there's a reason for it we realize that god has placed us in this age of laodicea not to be not to be survivors but to be overcomers to be a people that overcome the enemy that we face in this hour overcoming laodicea in its slothfulness and it's in its lack of repentance overcoming laodicea in all of its ways and here god is committed to his word there's one thing that god cannot do i've learned all the way from a little bitty child knowing these things that god cannot lie and if god has a purpose in a person's life that god will god will bring and fulfill that purpose in that person's life and here today no matter how important you are know how matter how unimportant you are you are here for his purpose and many times we think in life that our part has is maybe a little too little too little to be noticed but each of us have a specific role in christianity maybe it's just to witness to one or or to just live a life and maybe it's for sisters just to just to to to dress holy and for somebody to give their life of christ to christ because of watching the testimony of an individual and we realize that no matter what we go through no matter what satan tries to pin on us that god's purpose will be performed in all things and we realize that god's purpose can never be defeated there is nothing that can defeat it so happy aren't we to be today resting upon that beautiful revelation of the word of the living god that there is nothing present nor things that can come there's no sickness nor sorrow nor death no perils nor such nor nothing can separate us from the purpose of the living god you see what god has imagined in his mind what god has purposed in his heart to bring to pass there is no demon there is no power there is nothing can separate us you see nothing can separate god's great eternal plan it must be as god has said no matter what comes no matter what the enemy throws at us we know god's eternal plan nothing can separate us from that he can throw cancer at us and it won't separate us from god's plan it may tear us up in the humanistic point it may tear us up in our own ways it may tear our body down it may tear our maybe our belief structure in a sense but it will not tear god's purpose down whatsoever and we realize that in all things that god gets the glory a lot of times people think that just because they come out on the other side of a battle or they go through something that that their name is higher absolutely not in this kingdom of god if we go through something that is for god's glory it is not for us as individuals to feel like we're something that we came through with this or we went through that it is for god's purpose and for god's glory and we realize it teaches us that god can use every faculty of our being if we are surrendered to him he can use our mind our dreams our subconscious our first conscious our tongue our songs our eyes and everything that we can that we have can be used of god if it's committed to god i want to commit my ways to him this morning everything that you are just committed to god he'll use every outlet and every part of you he'll use it no matter what it is he'll use it if it's sanctified to his purpose and calling and we look out and we think about the mothers that are of this church and we think about my mom and i think about my grandma and i think about the ladies in my life my mother-in-law my own wife and i and i see the display i don't just see the display of himself but i watch the expression of god realizing that god has placed on the inside of that mother he has placed on the inside of that mother godly characteristics to be a real mom to be a rugged christian he didn't call us to run around and to drink and do all of these things and run around on our children and place ipads in front of them but to be real god fearing women that testify the things of god and we look at the commitment of the mother and we think about we think about how they're so committed to stay there day in and day out before the lord and asking his will and wanting his will and we think about that little possum how that she was so committed to go to a far to a to a prophet's house and here they would bypass it and the prophet would bypass it but yet that mother's love for her babies you see she was pregnant and now she had those little babies and because of because of her because of her commitment as a mother to bring forth and to give her life for them she was committed to bring forth life and to lay at a prophet's doorstep now today she could come and lay at my doorstep but i wouldn't know what it is but she came to the right door and she was committed and you think about the deer as as as a as a mother of a deer would step out as a in a heroic space she would step out to guard her children and we think about the the lady our minds are reminded about the lady that was on that train that time and remember as she's coming back on that train she's coming back from college and she's she's going back through there and and her friends are around her and they're making fun of this lady that was all scarred up that that had oh a horrible looking face but yet the the conductor knew the story behind it you see it was the mother's love that allowed her to step out in a fire and run up into a burning building and save her child you see she was committed to bring the purpose of a motherhood to pass she couldn't be a mother without that child and i think about the commitment of god today that god is not leaving us in laotis here just here alone that god is committed to his promise he's committed to his children you see he's not obligated to this flesh but he is obligated to his word and what god had in his mind before the foundation of the world will come to pass this flesh may let you down this flesh your teeth may fall out may have to get false teeth you may have to get glasses and may have to put hair plugs in your hair and all types of different things this flesh will disappoint you but god will never disappoint you hallelujah now the bible says here in colossians chapter 1 and 12 he says giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meek to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son now notice who hath god who hath delivered us us his children us his people from the power of darkness and hath translated us now that greek word for translating it is methyl satiemy and it means to remove from one place to another or to change of a situation or place or remove from an office of a steward or to to depart from life or to die and we see here that he hath removed us from darkness and translated us into the kingdom of his dear son he hath removed us from the way of satan he has removed us from darkness and placed us as the children of light in verse 14 he says in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created for by him hallelujah we're all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him all things were created by him and for him there is not a tree that is here that was not created by him nor for him it is here to serve out its purpose if a tree was created for a purpose and a flower was created for a purpose how about sons and daughters of god that were placed in the midst of the flaming fire of laodicea that how much more that he would have a children that would be called by his namesake that would be brought out of it all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist i know that this is hard for some agnostics and atheists to understand but he is before you he is behind you he created you and by him all things hold together and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven all things were created by him i'm so thankful there's a lot of people that look upon the cross and they think that it's a god an ungodly symbol that people hang in their steering wheel or or they hang people hang there or people hanging around their neck and different things but people do not realize what that's that cross symbolizes is that on that cross it symbolizes that the judgment was taken for all of humanity and through all the pain jesus was committed through all the agony jesus was committed people look on the cross and they turn their head from the cross but they don't realize what that cross means to me it does not realize what that cross means to you for on that old rugged cross is where my lord and savior took upon himself my sin your sin and it symbolizes that sin was judged once and for all whoo hallelujah jesus christ is the head of the body he was god he is god and he will forever remain god over the messiah kingdom and here he is expressing himself in this hour in this moment in this day he is expressing himself we look back to the very beginning and think about god we can't understand god but here the invisible god created all things but we look back if you could open up your imagination as it were and look back and you could see you could see god and out of god with the logos the son and you think about that god in the great beginning before he ever spoke in adam before he ever spoke a molecule or things into existence god had attributes in him and you are his display of his attributes in god was to be a healer but for him to be a healer somebody had to get sick in god there was attributes to be a savior but for him to be a savior somebody had to be lost and in him was the attributes to be a father and in christ the mystery of god revealed the prophet said that he loved fatherhood and before he could be before he could be a father he had to express himself as the son of man and for him to display himself he had to create himself a body so he could become a father a father over him to think about that all of these things were in god's mind now to think about there are things that go on in your own individual lives but to think about that if you are in god's mind then you are in god's mind now because god is not a god like you and i that is finite that changes with the wind of direction but god is infinite he's infallible he's the all-powerful one and if he had you and your offspring in his mind hallelujah you will always be in his mind and all of these attributes were wound up in one person and that person was jesus christ all of these things were displayed and manifested and made clear before us as his children it's easy for us to look back and to see god in jesus it's easy for us to look back and see god in the apostles and seek god and the prophets but for those that were standing there the pharisees they did not see god manifested but they seen a false prophet manifested in front of them they didn't realize what they were missing what was happening in front of them and what was being displayed what was poured out that god almighty had poured himself into a body they were missing what was taking place in front of them they thought you know the first year of his ministry everyone was excited with him in the second year of his ministry things began to get heated with the pharisees and the sadducees and they were watching the display of god that no other man could do these things except god be with him but they realized they realized that this was a threat to their sadducee kingdom and i'd say that if you are a part of a sadducee kingdom it will make you sad if you do not see the kingdom of the messiah and here they were missing this great i am in front of them they turned them down flatly and cold but they didn't realize that god was manifested on earth for three years to display god on earth what was god doing is god was getting himself and preparing himself a body you see this god that we're serving he's not a god that just began yesterday over your problems that showed up today but the god that you are serving is the god who can and he's the god who will is that the god that you serve this morning the god that i serve he can heal the sick and he will heal the sick the god that i serve this morning can raise the dead and he will raise the dead the god that i serve this morning can cleanse the rapper cleanse the leper and he has cleansed the leper he clan he can cleanse the center and he will cleanse the center he can save the lost and he will save the lost he can bring our families in he can bring our prodigals in he can bring our troubled families in and he will bring them in he's a god that can perform miracles and he's a god that will perform miracles but he is right here he is right here so don't push him away don't push him away out of your existence don't push him way back somewhere in some far off distant land don't push him away that he's up somewhere past saturn and mars and all the other jupiter and all those things don't push him out there he's right here he's right here god had a purpose in displaying himself you see we can gladly and we can look upon the things of god and we see god expressing himself but we also see satan expressing himself in this hour we see him expressing himself in danger and in sickness and in germs and all types of things and you want to watch your own life and watch which one you are displaying whether you are expressing christ or expressing satan you see the one that you're influenced by is the one that you will portray if you are feeding it's simple as this if you are feeding on the mind of a man you will produce the mind of a man but if you are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man you will produce an unfailing word hallelujah you see the source of all truth is standing by his word and he is committed to bring it to pass and we want our motive to be his motive we want his mind to be our mind we want his thoughts to be our thoughts we want his word to be our word we want his expression to be our expression we want his thinking we don't want our thinking our thinking got us in trouble our thinking put us in a in the end of a bottle our thinking got us in some real messes but his thinking hallelujah his thinking came and brought me up out of the my reclaimed that's the mind that we want to have not the mind of andrew spencer not the mind of ron spencer but the mind of almighty god you know the mind is a very powerful thing and science tells us there was research done in 2012 that tells us that we as humans only access 10 of our brain it's a staggering thought now whether whether they know what they're talking about or not that's up to them they'll make up their mind tomorrow but they say that we as humans only access 10 of our brain that the rest of the 90 is their staggering or it's or it's unused or it's unactivated but we if we think about the things that we get accomplished with our 10 what if we would put our 100 of our brain if we could actually have the capacity to be able to access all of the mental faculties that are placed in us if we had the capacity to express what was really in our mind now there has been great men like albert einstein that had the capacity to that go way far beyond beyond my hillbilly thinking that can go out i could break atoms and different things and tap into god's laboratory what were they doing they were expressing a capacity of the brain that maybe you and i as just ordinary individuals we can't we can't understand that capacity or we can't access that capacity but there is a mind hallelujah there is a mind that we have the capacity to be able to express the godhead hallelujah bodily is filled in jesus but now he is no longer there in heaven but he is in earth hallelujah to think about that if you if you could access the full word of god the full thought of god and what is this that has been displayed to you and on this hour the mind of christ whoo i don't fully grasp everything here i don't as a human i don't understand i don't understand everything that has been being brought out i be an idiot to say that i understand it all and anybody does tell you they understand all the mysteries and all the events and everything they're lying to you they don't only god understands the capacity but there is a capacity in which he put on the inside of you to be able to display none other than himself he has not asked you he did not ask you hallelujah he did not ask you to do what you did not have the capacity to do if god asked you to display himself he was known that you have got the capability to bring that capacity manifest who he's not promised you a baptism of the holy ghost without you being able to access it he's not promised you healing without you being able to access it he's not promised you deliverance without being able to access it there is a capacity on the inside of the bride of jesus christ that has access to the mind of god that'll shut hell up he has not asked us to do what we did not have the capacity to do hallelujah there are some that are amongst us that can see visions and have dreams and and be very spiritual and understand the things of god for those individuals he has allowed them a capacity to bring forth and manifest him now you may be only able to say amen you may be only able to sing you may be only able to clap your hands off beat but god has not asked you to do what you did not have the capacity to do you see if he asks you to do something he knows good and well that you're capable to do it it's just like a lot of people sit down at a piano and they never they never can express the capacity of being able to bring forth a piano player but you look at sister cassie she has the capacity because god for ordained her before the world to be a piano player and you enjoy her piano playing you enjoy her gift but if i got over there you wouldn't necessarily enjoy my gift i could play chopsticks or something else on it but you wouldn't enjoy me playing chopsticks to amazing grace i don't have the capacity to be able to express him in that way you see god and music you see god in man you see god in nature and every tree has been asked to bring forth of its own kind every tree he did not ask of the corn to produce strawberries but he asked the strawberries to produce strawberries he asked corn to produce corn he asked the bride to produce the bride of jesus christ the church can't have the capacity to express this but the body of jesus christ that has the mind of christ has the capacity to express himself on earth hallelujah i'm overwhelmed by these things to think about the threefold purpose of god i have spent much time if you've listened to my ministry whatsoever at all you will know that i have spent much time in god christ is god the mystery of god revealed i have spent so many hours looking over this thing so normally i can't get through the first two hours it takes four hours to listen to the whole thing but i normally can't get to the two out first two hours without having a jubilee to myself but i have spent much time in there because i believe that that was a an expression that that is a capacity that the blood of jesus christ has the access to that this was god manifested in flesh when abraham sat down and he ate with melchizedek we have watched that same melchizedek in action in this day it is none other than the son of man and we watch the threefold purpose of god that god wanted to reveal himself to the people and secondly he wanted to have the preeminence in his body of believers and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position and in all of those purposes there are folds there are a threefold purpose of god and in all of those folds there is one main one and that is jesus he is here to restore the kingdom to its rightful his position and did not jesus teach us how to pray thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth on earth i don't believe we actually understand the capacity of jesus's prayers sometimes that he thou will be done on earth as it is in heaven if you look at god's purpose in heaven and god's purpose on earth it's still the same if we could only learn the power of jesus's prayer to tie us to his eternal word he's not asked you to believe something that you cannot believe he has not asked you to display something that you cannot display he has not asked you to do oh pray for me he has not asked you to do something that he knew that you weren't capable of doing you look at the prophets in the old testament they could only express a certain part of god you're seeing god partly you sing god in abraham partly you sing god in noah partly you sing god in moses partly you sing god in david but they could not express the fullness of god because they were not god but when jesus was manifested in the fullness deity himself when he was standing on earth god in his fullness to die for the sin of people that he might bring to his church hallelujah his church not the denominations but his church a sanctified life that he might have the preeminence and the fullness in his church notice to manifest every promise in these last days that he promised to think today that he is manifesting himself every promise where is he at he's in you some people get so mixed up when they get into trouble and they think god's done mad at him and far off and he's he's gonna push them aside but they forget the god that is dwelling on the inside of them you watch a person that gets in the midst of a crisis sometimes and they'll go to holding onto things that can't help them they'll go to holding on to things that they don't know that they know does not have the capacity to be able to take care of them but in the midst of a crisis you watch somebody that deals with a sickness or deals of things they'll handle it in a certain way and they forget what they had the capacity to do i i have to say that as an individual as a humanistic in a humanistic standpoint there are things and there are trials that you will face that there are times when the enemy will war with your mind tell you that you're not good enough tell you that you must have been a secret sinner that you that you could not have got this got this bad thing that has happened to you unless you had done something wrong but you see in a moment you'll allow those whispers of the enemy you allow those whispers of the enemy to override the whispers of the bridegroom and here he is in this day whispering secrets to his wife but yet the enemies on the other side whispering lies in her ear trying to make her have a spiritual amnesia to make her forget who she is and what she is here to do but when he met jesus jesus knew who he was jesus was brought here for a purpose jesus was manifested for a purpose and jesus was committed to bringing that purpose to pass now notice if the brothers and sisters could share this with you today this quote and christ the mystery of god revealed in paragraph 374 the prophet said what was jesus manifested for to show god we could close the door right now and we could leave and say we have had absolute church what was jesus manifested for to show god he was god he had to be no man could die no prophet could die he was god he was the god of the prophets he was the prophets he was the kings he was the history he was he that was to come he that was and he that is and he that's to be in that day in this day the same yesterday today and forever he was manifested for that purpose made clear made known to bring into view that we could understand god who and for god to understand us you see god god in the beginning could not understand how you feel brother donny when you're going through pain as god because he could not understand because he was god but when he poured himself into christ and he took on the robe of humanity he could feel like brother donnie feels he could feel like our brothers and sisters feel he could understand a headache he could understand pain he could understand a broken heart he was manifested to show god to make clear and to bring into view that this is me verse 8 paragraph 375 and throw that purpose and through that purpose through that purpose he achieved a church that he the fullness of god he might bring to pass every promised word of god and in his last days when when he gets the preeminence preeminence in the church the position his place in the church let me read it again when he gets the preeminences preeminence in the church the position her place no his place in the church jesus said that he that believeth on me the worst that i do shall he do also even more than he's do than these shall he do for i go to my father see that was his purpose there was a manifestation and now today he wants to get somebody that can so see it that they can let the word see jesus so seen it so was so perfectly born for the day until god expressed every move that he made he was god's revelations god revealed now he's sanctified with his spirit of body excuse me with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed now see he could go back and pick up what these other fellows has left off here in the last days by his holy spirit and reveal all the mystery of the seven seals see he is expressing himself that's his purpose he's committed to that purpose that's why he died that's the second fold of his threefold manifestation first to express himself in christ then to express himself through the church and the same thing christ was a word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them let that sink in the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them can't you see when you take that word that these things shall you do because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world can't you exceed why god is being manifested to express himself not for you to get glory not for you to be magnified but for god to receive glory honor and blessings he hath prepared himself a body who you're talking about me i'm talking about you the prophet would say who is me who is me this ain't me this hand ate me this flesh ate me my imagination ate me but on the inside that's the real person that is where you watch god work throughout your imagination your affection and your reasoning and then walk through your flesh who is you who is really on the inside of you what's making you dress this way sisters what's making you brothers live a holy life it's god some people look on you you sisters you dress holy you live holy and they think well there's some man making them do that i have never called up one of the sisters of this church and told them that they need to come to church dressing like this i have preached to them but i have never called them up and told them that if you don't come to church dress like this i'll cast you out absolutely not it's jesus's job to catch you and it's jesus's job to reel you in he just does the preaching of the word but i have never called a brother up and told them don't you dare come into church wearing a pair of shorts there is something on the inside of these brothers on the inside of these sisters that makes them want to dress holy holiness don't begin on the outside it begins on the inside and when holiness is on the inside when purity is on the inside when when the holy ghost is on the inside it'll push its way out just like a seed does when you commit it to the grounds you don't go out there and dig it up you bury it you put it in the ground you water it let the sun rise on it and you watch it push out what it was committed to do and that's what is being displayed before gospel lighthouse and the bride of jesus christ you are watching christ on the inside of the church working on the outside forgive me i'm a little bit excited today because if the children of god grasp this thought there is nothing that can defeat them and when you get sick just because you get sick does not make you an enemy to god just because you go through troubles does not make you an enemy to god it is showing that god has confidence in you you see he knew that he could not call miss methodist to this because miss methodist couldn't dress this way but you see there has been a word released in this hour to make a body make a bride dress right you look at miss methodist and you look at miss wesley and you look at them and they try to raise up their father and you look at them and their garments are completely spotty but you look at this body of jesus christ i know sometimes you get caught up on on what you did and what you came through if you're gonna look through the eyes of mercy this morning he don't see you spotty he sees you pure he don't see you ragging he sees you clean hallelujah hallelujah age don't have aids don't have nothing to do with the promise of god he's still committed to the promise how did jesus defeat satan by the word so that is the blood of jesus christ that is her weapon of choice it's not a bone arrow it's not a bazooka it's not an ar-15 but the weapon of choice for the bride of jesus christ is the weapon of the word and the weapon of this word will defeat satan any time any place under any situation undiscern any circumstance you put it on you can test this word and the test will show that the word is true you see the bride of jesus christ as thus saith the lord or she said still she's not moving without her head hallelujah hallelujah you watch you watch as a father and a son you watch them as they walk you watch their life and you can see there are certain characteristics between brother steve i oppressed his brother steve you can watch the manifestation and you watch the influence and he watched his characteristics and he stood up here and he sang to you an uncloudy day and then you watch the characteristics of brother steve that was passed on through the germ through the drum of life to his son brother jeffrey and you watch as brother jeffrey sings and brother jeff reacts you'll see brother steve and brother jeffrey same as any individual here you are carrying characteristics of your father and you watch as the bride of jesus christ as she works hand in hand if you ever see a husband and a wife that been together for a very long time and know how to work things well key on that part know how to work things well you watch them as they know how to work things well that they work hand in hand together they finish each other's sentences and they finish each other how they do if one is hammering the other one will hand them a nail if you watch how they act you'll see that they have become one you see the two are no longer twain but they have become one and you watch jesus christ two thousand years ago and you watch the body today and you'll see the same life same action same word same power same wonder same majesty you are watching none other than jesus whew there is oneness in unity and you see it's not somewhere far off up in heaven but deity is in you and in that sermon oneness of unity he said that your voice is his voice and when you speak he speaks there is a voice of resurrection in the body of jesus christ you watch as that body goes over and lay hands on a dead body you watch that dead body raise up you watch that resurrection power on the inside of a human vessel when they go lay hands on a sick and you watch the voice of resurrection you watch that power be displayed you watch when somebody lays a prayer cloth on something and you watch the purpose of god come to pass it is god's manifestation that he is not leaving his word alone but he's following it up with an amen i wish i had 200 people to scream to today because i forgot a feeling y'all be screaming back to me i got a feeling brother shannon and his sister jenny probably just jumped up and had himself a good jubilee right there brother jordan sister kirsten just let out a big old hallelujah i can't wait i can't wait to have us all back here together i believe i believe we get us all back in here together together and we get to preach in the gospel of jesus christ i believe we'll enjoy it more i believe we'll take a body change i believe i believe there's strength in numbers that's why i gotta have you i'm not too big to think that i can do this on my own i have never thought i was big enough but i know he is i know he is and i see him in you one another when i look back across this congregation and i think about those that are that would be sitting here if coveted 19 wouldn't have raised its ugly face i think about that i think about the smiles on your face brother andy says wanda when i go to say something crazy or say something funny you always get you always smile and you always and i think about those things i think about i think about our brothers and sisters how how that you react to the preaching of the word and i see how it is storing something on the inside of you you see the reason it's stirring something on the inside of you the word is being made manifest on the inside and you said hey that's jesus that ain't even true that ain't brother ron that's jesus that can't be them they don't know and i didn't tell nobody that's got to be jesus it's sir something on the inside of you what is this it is a continuation of the book of acts it is a continuation of the ministry of the son of man that you are watching a sharp two-widget sword as it goes cutting to and fro you're watching the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and you realize that's him that's him that's a powerful thing to recognize him it's a very powerful thing to recognize him because there's a lot of people that's a lot of people that do not recognize him because the veil of flesh but there is a people that look past the flesh and they see god there's a lot of friends that listen to these services and they don't get the same thing out of it like you get out of it because they see the veil of flesh but you realize that there's something more going on here with this whole battle as us as a church full gospel lighthouse there's something more going on here there's something more don't get your eyes on the flesh and don't get captivated with what's happening with happening with this week or that week or this week or that week satan gets into details but if you could watch what is really happening here if you can really watch that jesus is at work i don't understand i don't understand or if we understand the the capabilities or the capacity that god has has brought before us you see no matter what we go through no matter what we've been through god is still committed to us you see when abraham was without an heir he was still committed to him when abraham laid isaac on the altar he was still committed to him when egypt was locked up in bondage when israel was locked up in bondage down in egypt god was still committed to him so god raised up a deliverer and he was still committed to them when moses was a runaway slave he was still committed to them you see your circumstance doesn't change the promise and it does not change god's commitment a lot of times in earthly realms we get consumed with everything that everything's going on around us that we can't trust you no more because of what you did we may forgive you but we'll never forget it but god being god be an infinite and there is a blood cell there is a blood cell that makes you pure god not only forgives you but he forgets what you said he forgets what you've done he forgets what you thought you see he is the creator of heaven and earth and all things were made by him and for him he is the creator of the new creation of god of christ and if any man be in christ he is a new creature you've seen you'll look back where you were you looked back at some of your lives and some of you were homeless some of you were strung out on drugs and on alcohol but because god is a creator he manifested himself and brought forth sons to be to his glory god's promises are true god's promises aren't necessarily easy but they're true they're true a lot of times we're looking on the back end of the bible and looking for a tamp or a stamp on the back end of that door and that promise and see when it's going to come to pass there's neither a time stamp on it saying when it's going to be fulfilled in your life but i know that he is the lord our god that heals all of our diseases that by his tribes we are healed it does not say on this date you will be healed it does not day on this date that you will be saved or it does not say on this day your offspring will come in but there is a promise and god is committed to his promise but wonder on the other side of the promise can you remain committed with faith to stand there with the faith that was once delivered to the saints that could stand there they were sown as under they were jerked to pieces they were put in fires they were put in these things hallelujah some through the blood but all come to christ you see are you committed he's committed to you he's promised you his promise and he will bring it to pass isaiah when he prophesied that there would be a virgin that would conceive it didn't have a time stamp on it and it didn't have an expiration date on it but when that word was anchored and hooked in the anchor of the mary the the virgin mary when that word anchored in her womb it anchored in her womb and she said be it unto me according to thy word and when this word of this hour has been anchored in the womb hallelujah when that word has been anchored in your womb you'll say be it unto me according to thy word according to thou we o god be it unto me if it makes me act funny if it makes me dress funny if it makes me dance funny be it unto me hallelujah what a funny mother's day gift do you all well you're committed to your children and you want to see you want to you you tell them what you want to do you want to see them what you would you tell them pick up their toys and it seems like there's a lack of commitment sometimes they just don't pick up their i told johnny johnny you're going to set in timeouts this is your second strike you're in trouble now you're just not committed johnny little susie i told you to pick up your baby dog dresses and put them away there's a lack of commitment on your part i wonder sometimes if god don't talk to us that way it looks like there's a little bit of lack of commitment on your part it looks like you have just forgot what i have told you i told you that i was big enough i told you that i was strong enough i told you i was god i told you i was with you i told you i performed miracles i wonder today i'd say if he could look out on the church of denominations that he could see a people that is uncommitted but i say to the bride of jesus christ there is a commitment on the inside that she didn't put there but he did it's not little johnny little johnny i told you i told you not to do that i told you not to stick your finger in that mouse trap i told you it bites you you see god loves you so much he don't treat you like an ignorant child but he comes to you and he loves you and though there's a trap of the enemy that has set out before you he comes in and he wraps his arms around you he says don't go that way walk with me walk this way brother howard him was trying to sing and bring forth that song my way gets brighter my low gets lighter walking up the king's highway you see he couldn't really sing it because you see it was part of this sermon that i had to express and he didn't know that this was a part of even my notes but there's something on the inside of you that god wraps his arms around you and says now look you walk this way you see as you begin to walk this way you feel as your load gets lighter and you lift your eyes towards the sun the s-o-n and everything around you you just begin to understand and you watch as god is displayed you see he comes and he wraps his arms around you because he's committed to you he's committed to the promise that he laid there he said that he'd have a bride he said that he'd have a bride and she's here she's on the scene and against all denominational odds though she's called holy rollers though she's mocked and though she's scorned though she's made fun of for believing this last day's message she's still standing because god said so because god said so in spite of all of yourself god said so you see you see and when he come and he was the fullness of the kings the prophets hallelujah that god had bodily rested at him it rested in him and he come to redeem out of there abroad a masterpiece a masterpiece that says to satan when he says that the days of miracles has passed that there's no such a thing as these things that you're talking about notice what that masterpiece says get thee behind me satan see a masterpiece standing and guarding you didn't realize what you were doing but you're a masterpiece go and listen to it that the only the gods only provide a way of worship that there is a masterpiece standing and guarding that word and you watch the genes of a man you watch that gene of the man is in the woman and what makes the woman and that's the way the word of god is in the church that's what makes the church the bride the word you stand there guarding that word guarding that promise the bible says in romans 9 11 that the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth speaking of esau and jacob that the perfect purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth you see every person has their part to play you look at judas and you look at peter they both had their parts to play in the great drama of god that some were vessels of honor and some are vessels of dishonor that he is the potter and you and i are the clay and it's he that chooses that how much of a clump of clay that he throws on the wheel and then he puts through the fire to bring forth his majesty though we were sometimes alienated and the enemies in our mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled you see he is bringing forth his portion through your life making sons and daughters of god to his glory a new creation of god notice what the bible says here in ephesians 2 and 10 that we are his workmanship created in union with christ jesus under good works ephesians 4 and 24 and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness this new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation that is exactly what it says it says it is a new creation it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by the ways of flesh that was how he dealt with israel he chose abraham and of abraham's issue through the godly isaac line but now out of every kindred tribe and nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was god created in the form of man now by his spirit he is creating many sons unto himself god the creator creating himself a part of his creation that this is the true revelation of god this was his purpose this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as the author of this new creation of god his sovereign power brought it to pass his sovereign power brought it to pass you look back on the mighty manifestations of god musicians come you look back at all that he did in this generation it was not done for man's glory it was done for his glory notice on the backside of the threefold purpose he's the main one good lord willing we'll finish this next weekend but god is committed to you today tomorrow and every day in the future and it's by his sovereign power that he's bringing these things to pass god is so good to call us in this hour and may our hearts be burning with the love of jesus christ that against our own humanity and against our own human flesh that god was still committed to us when we couldn't bring to pass his sovereign will his sovereign power brought it to pass he came looking for me when i couldn't go to him he came looking for me i could never repay the debt i owe to him so i will do my very best to serve him i believe that it's the commitment of sons and daughters of god to commit their ways into him he was there all [Music] the time oh he was there all the time in life oh he was there all the time for he was there all [Music] the time oh he was there [Music] waiting paper in life oh he was there [Music] lord no matter what tomorrow brings i i will praise the lord [Music] i will pray the lord no matter what tomorrow brings what it hasn't shown [Music] [Music] i will serve the lord hallelujah i will serve the lord [Music] [Music] i i will praise the lord [Music] i will praise i praise the lord [Music] no matter what tomorrow [Music] brings [Music] oh yes i feel like [Music] i like crazy oh yes i feel like serving all day long [Music] god is good all the time he put a song in this heart of mine god is [Music] is [Music] he filled us with his holy spirit we can't stand is everlasting and
