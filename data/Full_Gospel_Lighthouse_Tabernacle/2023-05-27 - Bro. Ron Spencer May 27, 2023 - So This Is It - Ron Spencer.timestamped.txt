[50:02] brother Roy Shrewsbury went to be with
[50:05] the Lord
[50:06] and for those that know brother Roy how
[50:08] many new brother Roy
[50:10] brother Royce Shrewsbury is an
[50:12] ambassador of the message he was a giant
[50:14] he was a general he was one of the
[50:17] greatest gentlemen that I ever knew and
[50:20] uh he we loved him he called me son and
[50:23] I was very pleased for him to call me
[50:25] son and preached for him so many times
[50:28] and we had such a great relationship
[50:32] uh you mind if I tell you a couple of
[50:34] stories of brother Roy
[50:35] of course you've saw the you saw the
[50:37] movie of the world war experience of he
[50:41] shared with you but one of the things
[50:43] that outstood out to me
[50:46] was brother Roy very early
[50:49] in his ministry he had went to a meeting
[50:52] in Pennsylvania where A.A Allen was
[50:54] preaching
[50:56] and they asked brother Roy if he would
[50:58] be the preliminary speaker and give him
[51:00] about 20 minutes
[51:02] brother Roy stepped to the platform a
[51:04] very huge audience of people and he just
[51:07] started talking about how great Jesus is
[51:09] and and went right down the line of the
[51:13] name of the Lord Jesus Christ baptism
[51:15] and all of these and all of these things
[51:17] and he began to speak to them he said
[51:20] and I was sitting right behind it he
[51:22] said I took my seat right behind A.A
[51:24] Allen as he was preaching and he said he
[51:27] started and he said all those preachers
[51:29] around and said it felt like a hundred
[51:31] or so preachers on the platform and
[51:34] and he said hey Alan started preaching a
[51:36] trinity Doctrine and he said all of them
[51:38] started screaming amen and he said I'm
[51:41] sitting in the wrong Church
[51:45] I said what'd you do he said I just got
[51:47] up
[51:49] I just walked right down the aisle
[51:52] he said I'll stand for Jesus
[51:57] amen
[52:00] brother Roy was with brother branham's
[52:02] coughing coughing
[52:04] and
[52:06] and he said I found myself alone with
[52:09] the coffin
[52:10] and brother branham's body
[52:13] and he said I prayed a prayer
[52:15] and it always stood out to me he said I
[52:17] prayed a prayer
[52:18] he said Lord don't let this love leave
[52:22] the Earth
[52:23] that this man had
[52:26] he said let me have just a piece of it
[52:29] I believe his prayer was answered and
[52:32] amen and we loved him with all of our
[52:35] hearts and I I so I so loved him and
[52:39] after the cancer diagnosis of brain
[52:42] cancer had been told to me brother Roy
[52:45] said he was down praying
[52:47] and he he said brother Ron and he would
[52:50] he would he would call me periodically
[52:52] and and he called me and said brother
[52:54] Ron God spoke to me while I was praying
[52:56] for you
[52:57] and he said
[52:59] when he spoke to me he said I'm sending
[53:02] brother Ron into the lion's den like
[53:05] Daniel
[53:07] and he said it's a place where no words
[53:09] ever lived before
[53:11] and I'm sending him in
[53:13] but tell him what Daniel told the king

[56:32] you believe that
[56:34] amen God bless you if you'll turn with
[56:36] me in your word the scripture this
[56:38] afternoon First Corinthians chapter 9
[56:40] and verse 24 and then we'll go to
[56:43] Genesis chapter 5. foreign
[56:51] God bless you
[57:00] First Corinthians chapter 9 and verse
[57:02] 24.
[57:05] I think Paul when he's writing this
[57:07] I think he's saying it's a very
[57:09] incredible things to us
[57:12] I don't want to waste my time and waste
[57:14] my energies
[57:16] I want to be very specific
[57:20] and whenever I think about these
[57:22] scriptures I think about brother biscoll
[57:24] preached a sermon one time called be
[57:26] thou an example
[57:28] and he said I don't want to waste my
[57:31] time
[57:32] and I don't think any of us want to do
[57:34] that and at this juncture of my life I
[57:37] don't want to waste any energy
[57:39] I want to make sure I give it all to the
[57:41] Lord
[57:43] Paul Reed writes it like this
[57:46] know you not that they which run in a
[57:49] race
[57:51] run all
[57:53] but one receiveth the prize
[57:56] so run that ye may obtain
[57:59] and every man that striving for the
[58:02] Mastery is temperant in all things
[58:05] now they do it to obtain a corruptable
[58:07] crown
[58:09] but we and incorruptable
[58:12] I therefore so run not as uncertainly
[58:16] so fight I not as one that beat the air
[58:20] see what I'm saying
[58:22] but I keep under my body and bring it
[58:25] into subjection
[58:27] lest that by any means when I have
[58:30] preached to others I myself should be a
[58:33] Castaway
[58:34] Genesis chapter 5 and verse 22.
[58:40] an Enoch walk with God
[58:43] after he began Methuselah 300 years and
[58:48] begat sons and daughters
[58:51] and all the days of Enoch were
[58:54] 365 years
[58:57] an Enoch walk with God and he was not
[59:03] for God took him
[59:04] and I want to say this to you I believe
[59:06] that I'm preaching to an audience
[59:10] that are going to fulfill some of these
[59:12] same prophecy
[59:15] and Ron Spencer walk with God I'd like
[59:18] for you to put your name there
[59:21] and Ron Spencer walk with God
[59:24] and he was not
[59:29] for God took him
[59:32] quite a testimony isn't it amen let's
[59:35] pray Lord Jesus we love you with all of
[59:37] our hearts
[59:39] we've gathered here this evening to hear
[59:41] from you
[59:42] Lord we have prayed we've laid a psych
[59:45] time to prepare ourselves
[59:48] much thoughts on these words
[59:50] now Lord I ask you not only to inspire
[59:53] the speaker but may you inspire every
[59:55] person here
[59:57] strengthen our hearts strengthen our
[59:59] bodies minister to us bless our guests
[1:00:02] here this evening brother Johnny that's
[1:00:05] came brother Glenn and his wife that's
[1:00:07] with us and the others that are here
[1:00:09] father we ask you that you would just
[1:00:11] give them strength and Lord pass by our
[1:00:15] way
[1:00:16] that we would know father without a
[1:00:18] doubt more than a man came to where I
[1:00:21] was setting touch our hearts now in
[1:00:24] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and
[1:00:27] amen and amen you may be seated
[1:00:33] I'd like to speak to you tonight and
[1:00:35] probably in the morning on so this is it
[1:00:39] so this is it
[1:00:42] there comes a time when prophecy
[1:00:44] intercepts with time
[1:00:47] and prophecy is no longer a projection
[1:00:50] of the thoughts of God or the attributes
[1:00:52] of the thoughts of God but now we be in
[1:00:56] the living physical attributes of God
[1:00:58] before the foundation of the world and
[1:01:00] then we came into existence and we're
[1:01:03] not just here to see if we could be made
[1:01:05] but God has a purpose for us
[1:01:09] and then we fulfill that purpose and
[1:01:12] then that purpose is fulfilled then our
[1:01:14] time is over and God takes us home kind
[1:01:17] of the dash that we live in our lives
[1:01:21] Enoch didn't have a book about himself
[1:01:23] to where that he that he had to he could
[1:01:27] understand this is the way it's going to
[1:01:29] be
[1:01:31] no doubt in his life is as he's walking
[1:01:35] and he's got very special grandfathers
[1:01:39] he's the Sabbath from Adam
[1:01:42] like you're the Sabbath Church age
[1:01:46] from the second Adam
[1:01:50] and so the first Adam had fellowship
[1:01:54] with Enoch and walked with Enoch for
[1:01:57] decades can you imagine some of those
[1:02:00] conversations that they must have had
[1:02:03] I would have wanted to absorb everything
[1:02:05] that Adam had to say Adam talking about
[1:02:08] when God the Jehovah God would come down
[1:02:11] and after he had made him The Keeper of
[1:02:14] the garden after he would come down in
[1:02:16] the evening and ask him like our Prophet
[1:02:19] would say have you had a good day
[1:02:22] it would come down in his presence would
[1:02:24] spell out l-o-v-e
[1:02:27] what a special time for God and His
[1:02:30] creation on the earth in the Garden of
[1:02:33] Eden when everything was perfect
[1:02:36] there was not one Speck of death in the
[1:02:40] Garden of Eden
[1:02:42] not one Speck of darkness in the Garden
[1:02:45] of Eden man was having fellowship with
[1:02:49] God
[1:02:50] what Adam stepped out of is really what
[1:02:54] we're getting ready to step back into
[1:02:58] we're going to a place where there's no
[1:03:01] Darkness
[1:03:02] we're going to place where there's no
[1:03:04] death
[1:03:05] if we can understand that you and I have
[1:03:08] never seen a forest
[1:03:10] that that that doesn't have a leaf at
[1:03:12] the bottom
[1:03:16] we've never seen a Rose Garden that
[1:03:19] petals a fell off of
[1:03:22] we've never seen that kind of word death
[1:03:24] had set in
[1:03:27] but Adam fellowshipped were there was a
[1:03:30] perfect Rose Garden
[1:03:32] would project a place to where that even
[1:03:35] in heaven he would talk about were
[1:03:38] eternal life we don't understand time
[1:03:40] and he said he said sister Gertie
[1:03:44] he said maybe you're there and he says
[1:03:45] Where Have You Been she said oh I've
[1:03:47] been down by the Rose Garden for 500
[1:03:50] years
[1:03:52] so that's a long time well you've never
[1:03:54] been in God's Rose Garden
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:04:00] no doubt Adam and Enoch talked about
[1:04:03] that
[1:04:05] but I cannot imagine
[1:04:09] Even Adam looking
[1:04:12] at what the fall produced
[1:04:17] Adam had to make a choice
[1:04:19] and in making the choice to save Eve
[1:04:24] when she was found contaminated
[1:04:28] listen it just wasn't Eve now the world
[1:04:31] was contaminated
[1:04:34] and she be in his bride he had to
[1:04:38] respond some way
[1:04:40] and he being a type of God
[1:04:43] had to place his seed inside of her womb
[1:04:49] to preserve her
[1:04:51] let me just say the special thing about
[1:04:53] you tonight
[1:04:55] is God placed his seed inside of your
[1:04:59] womb of your soul
[1:05:03] that our realm of you will perish that
[1:05:06] spirit will go back to where it came
[1:05:08] from but that Gene seed of God
[1:05:11] that God placed there
[1:05:14] God can no more deny that than deny
[1:05:17] himself
[1:05:23] Hallelujah
[1:05:25] no doubt they had incredible Fellowship
[1:05:29] but now in this realm Adam is watching
[1:05:32] what unbelief has done to the Earth
[1:05:35] thorns and thistles and work
[1:05:38] human unbelief has destroyed the world
[1:05:42] now in Enoch's time it's the most
[1:05:46] scientific age that it's ever been
[1:05:48] brother man would say much higher than
[1:05:50] even our age
[1:05:52] and and so and so they would Fellowship
[1:05:55] no doubt around some of those incredible
[1:05:58] thoughts about how far the fall fall had
[1:06:02] came babies dying people dying but yet
[1:06:06] people had lived up to 900 and some
[1:06:09] years Adams Way up in his 900 years but
[1:06:12] God won't allow a man to live past a
[1:06:15] thousand
[1:06:16] before he takes him off of the Earth but
[1:06:19] sin was multiplied
[1:06:22] there was multiplying and and if I can
[1:06:26] just drop this here I didn't get to it
[1:06:28] last night but if I could just drop this
[1:06:30] here Adam had a hope
[1:06:35] and that's what he instilled inside of
[1:06:37] Enoch
[1:06:39] while he was being cast out of the
[1:06:41] Garden of Eden
[1:06:44] the sin that had taken upon himself was
[1:06:47] casting him out of the garden but God
[1:06:50] provided a way back
[1:06:52] [Applause]
[1:06:56] he provided a way back Enoch couldn't
[1:06:59] provide friends or or Adam could not
[1:07:02] provide for himself he couldn't cover
[1:07:04] his own sin but God provided a lamb
[1:07:14] brother Branham said
[1:07:16] he said God took
[1:07:18] a sheep
[1:07:20] he
[1:07:21] pulled the skin off of him
[1:07:25] as a type of himself
[1:07:27] wrapped Adam and Eve
[1:07:30] with that skin
[1:07:33] around them in the Garden of Eden as
[1:07:36] they're leaving
[1:07:38] he said love called him to do that
[1:07:42] other man said Eve with that blonde hair
[1:07:45] laid her head over on his muscle
[1:07:47] shoulders
[1:07:50] and they wept as they were going out and
[1:07:52] they said they heard something slappy
[1:07:55] and said it was no skin slapping against
[1:07:57] their legs blood running down their body
[1:08:02] God providing a way back
[1:08:07] listen we're all lost if God doesn't
[1:08:09] provide us a way back
[1:08:11] [Applause]
[1:08:12] and if you could say anything to Enoch
[1:08:15] we're going back
[1:08:19] we're going back
[1:08:21] to where I fell as shipped this world's
[1:08:25] not going to be this way forever
[1:08:30] listen Saints what you're witnessing now
[1:08:33] it's not going to always be this way
[1:08:35] [Applause]
[1:08:40] in Hebrews chapter 11.
[1:08:43] and I want you to read this with your
[1:08:45] own person in mind
[1:08:48] by faith
[1:08:50] innocuous translated
[1:08:54] that he should not see death
[1:08:58] and was not found because God translated
[1:09:02] him
[1:09:03] brother Ron do you believe that I not
[1:09:06] only believe that but I believe I'm
[1:09:07] going to be translated
[1:09:11] for before he had this translation
[1:09:15] he had this testimony
[1:09:18] that he pleased God
[1:09:23] major statement he didn't please his
[1:09:26] family he didn't please his home he
[1:09:29] didn't believe he didn't police the
[1:09:30] politics he didn't please nobody else
[1:09:33] and probably didn't please himself but
[1:09:36] he pleased God
[1:09:40] I'd like to say to you that's why I want
[1:09:44] my testimony
[1:09:46] brother under you believe I can listen
[1:09:48] not with these eyes
[1:09:51] but I believe the blood can be so
[1:09:53] applied to our life
[1:09:56] that when God sees through his own blood
[1:09:58] there's not an imperfection there's not
[1:10:02] a spot there's not a wreck on
[1:10:06] I believe God sees himself in our lives
[1:10:10] [Applause]
[1:10:19] but without faith it is impossible to
[1:10:22] please him
[1:10:25] for he that cometh to God must believe
[1:10:27] that he is
[1:10:29] and he is a rewarder that to them that
[1:10:32] diligently seek him
[1:10:36] by faith Noah Enoch and Noah's always
[1:10:39] put together
[1:10:41] Enoch's grandfather by faith eat Noah
[1:10:44] being warned of God of things not seen
[1:10:48] as yet
[1:10:50] moved with fear
[1:10:52] prepared an ark for to the saving of his
[1:10:55] house
[1:10:56] by the which he condemned the world
[1:11:01] by the witch he condemned the world
[1:11:06] by the which your life condemns the
[1:11:11] world
[1:11:15] by the witch your life
[1:11:18] judges your neighbor
[1:11:26] you say brother on but they've never
[1:11:27] been to this church but they see your
[1:11:29] sermon
[1:11:34] they see your sermon
[1:11:37] every one of you is a preacher
[1:11:40] oh brother I ain't feel led to preach
[1:11:42] live the sermon
[1:11:45] live the sermon
[1:11:47] live the sermon
[1:11:56] by the which he condemned the world
[1:11:59] and became the heir of righteousness
[1:12:01] which is of faith
[1:12:03] what incredible words
[1:12:05] Enoch had a testimony of by faith that
[1:12:09] he pleased God
[1:12:11] Jude would write this about Enoch
[1:12:14] and Enoch also the seventh from Adam
[1:12:18] prophesied
[1:12:21] Prophet a sight of these Sands behold
[1:12:24] the Lord cometh with ten thousand
[1:12:28] of his Saints
[1:12:31] Enoch wasn't just walking
[1:12:34] but Enoch was excelling
[1:12:41] the first Bibles was written in the
[1:12:43] heavens
[1:12:45] every Star was in its place written out
[1:12:49] now how did it get there brother Branham
[1:12:52] says he said it was kind of like a
[1:12:54] little light
[1:12:55] he said God was just like a light
[1:12:58] swirling
[1:12:59] and he said let there be a son
[1:13:03] and God believed his own word
[1:13:06] and the son came into existence
[1:13:09] and then planets and stars and he said a
[1:13:13] clinker would fall off of the sun and it
[1:13:15] would fall for millions of years and God
[1:13:18] would stop it every
[1:13:21] every Star in its exact place
[1:13:25] you and I look up and they look like
[1:13:27] they're that close together we look at
[1:13:29] the Milky Way no way can you count the
[1:13:31] Stars
[1:13:33] if you remember Abraham as a child he
[1:13:36] doesn't have a child but God looks at
[1:13:38] him and says that he's going to be the
[1:13:40] father of Nations
[1:13:42] God doesn't look him as a fatherless man
[1:13:46] but he looks at the book of life and the
[1:13:49] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:13:51] Abraham can you count the sand
[1:13:54] so shall thy seed be that had to have
[1:13:57] been overwhelming can you count the
[1:13:59] Stars
[1:14:01] so shall thy seek be
[1:14:05] are you with me God wrote that
[1:14:10] God rose that
[1:14:12] brother brother Brown said in the second
[1:14:15] the second let me just pause here just a
[1:14:17] moment
[1:14:18] never been a messenger ever stood on the
[1:14:21] earth and explained how it all came into
[1:14:23] existence
[1:14:25] but the mighty Angel Christ himself
[1:14:27] thought you needed to know
[1:14:30] he thought you needed to know because
[1:14:33] one of those Stars represents you on the
[1:14:36] Earth
[1:14:37] [Applause]
[1:14:39] are you with me now
[1:14:41] listen God's not just going to start a
[1:14:43] job he's going to finish his job
[1:14:51] Hallelujah
[1:15:02] no
[1:15:04] I cannot imagine the instructions
[1:15:08] given to Enoch
[1:15:10] now to write the second Bible
[1:15:13] but to do it on the Earth
[1:15:16] he's an engineer
[1:15:19] he's building pyramid
[1:15:24] and under the orchestration of God
[1:15:28] he's literally going to write the Bible
[1:15:30] so perfect
[1:15:31] until man can't figure it out today
[1:15:34] as a matter of fact the angle it is
[1:15:37] still mystically impossible to for
[1:15:41] science to figure out how
[1:15:44] that Enoch
[1:15:46] placed the pyramid
[1:15:51] perfectly
[1:15:54] we talk about that Caribou 42-inch horns
[1:15:57] still that way
[1:15:59] well the same God that got that Caribou
[1:16:02] it's the same God that had
[1:16:04] that pyramid set exactly on the lines
[1:16:11] exactly they're not an inch off
[1:16:16] [Applause]
[1:16:17] perfect
[1:16:19] ly placed there
[1:16:22] and the the
[1:16:24] sides of that pyramid
[1:16:27] is exactly on the same angle as the
[1:16:32] curvature of the Earth
[1:16:34] and it's exactly perfectly in the middle
[1:16:37] of the Earth
[1:16:40] Egypt didn't have that kind of knowledge
[1:16:44] let's just say it Egypt didn't have that
[1:16:47] kind of knowledge I'd say this when the
[1:16:49] seals were revealed and the Thunders
[1:16:51] were revealed and the church Ages were
[1:16:53] revealed there's not a church in the
[1:16:56] world had that kind of knowledge
[1:17:04] they didn't have it
[1:17:07] it's not even up for negotiation
[1:17:15] brother random wasn't guessing when he
[1:17:16] said who was on the first church or
[1:17:18] horse rider
[1:17:24] Billy Graham was all over the place with
[1:17:26] the church horse riders all over the
[1:17:28] place wrote books on it didn't even come
[1:17:31] close
[1:17:34] I thought it was interesting this week
[1:17:37] that the messenger of sodom's son
[1:17:41] Mr Sodom being Billy Graham
[1:17:43] and if you'll remember Billy Graham was
[1:17:45] the pastor of our presidents
[1:17:48] even on 9-1-1 when that horrific event
[1:17:51] took place there was only one civilian
[1:17:54] aircraft in the air that day
[1:17:58] and that aircraft was carrying Billy
[1:18:01] Graham
[1:18:02] to where George Bush was at
[1:18:08] I'd have to say he did his job
[1:18:11] but Franklin Graham
[1:18:14] went on record to say
[1:18:17] that hell
[1:18:19] is on the Earth
[1:18:23] every demon from hell has been loosed on
[1:18:27] the Earth
[1:18:28] about 50 years too late saying it
[1:18:32] when the seals were released every demon
[1:18:35] in hell
[1:18:37] was released on the earth and the seeds
[1:18:40] of all of that now is shown
[1:18:44] what Enoch knew was coming the sins of
[1:18:47] the world was getting so bad
[1:18:50] that destruction was on its way
[1:18:53] and he prophesied there's one coming a
[1:18:56] second Adam's coming
[1:18:57] do it
[1:18:59] first Adam brought death second Adam
[1:19:02] will bring life
[1:19:04] [Music]
[1:19:06] are you with me
[1:19:08] oh what a redeemer
[1:19:11] Oh What A Savior
[1:19:16] Enoch wrote this
[1:19:18] this Bible
[1:19:20] on the Earth
[1:19:22] so perfectly man couldn't understand it
[1:19:25] no doubt even the air channels
[1:19:29] as they're being built they look
[1:19:31] directly into the heavens
[1:19:34] and see a certain constellation of stars
[1:19:39] every one of them with prophetic
[1:19:41] importance
[1:19:42] probably the people that was working
[1:19:44] with Enoch no doubt did not understand
[1:19:48] no way could comprehend what Enoch was
[1:19:51] writing
[1:19:53] but that pyramid still stands
[1:19:57] it still stands I want you to think
[1:20:00] about this
[1:20:02] that second Bible that stands there
[1:20:05] today
[1:20:06] has stood there while Noah's flagged
[1:20:11] went over top of it imagine how many
[1:20:14] wars have taken place that tried to
[1:20:18] destroy it
[1:20:20] God won't let his word be destroyed
[1:20:29] he'll not let his word be destroyed
[1:20:34] man has tried to punch holes in this and
[1:20:37] tear out scriptures and tear out things
[1:20:39] that this is not inspired this is not
[1:20:42] for this day God won't let us learn
[1:20:53] he won't let his word be destroyed
[1:21:05] people say well I'll take the Bible over
[1:21:08] top of the message you're crazy
[1:21:11] the Bible and the message are the same
[1:21:15] [Applause]
[1:21:17] this is Jesus Christ
[1:21:19] and the message is Jesus Christ
[1:21:24] [Applause]
[1:21:28] you can amen you can Shout
[1:21:40] here's the important thing we're in the
[1:21:43] book
[1:21:45] we're in the boat
[1:21:48] and if the book can't be destroyed
[1:21:51] [Applause]
[1:21:52] you can't destroy me
[1:21:55] [Applause]
[1:22:16] no if I could just
[1:22:18] lay that there for a moment
[1:22:20] can you imagine in the scientific age
[1:22:24] how people want to throw darts
[1:22:26] at the word of God
[1:22:31] you and I live in an age
[1:22:34] who are they they don't even have a
[1:22:36] compass anymore
[1:22:43] where's the real man
[1:22:46] where's the real women
[1:22:52] they wouldn't vote in Abraham Lincoln if
[1:22:54] their life depended on it
[1:22:57] they wouldn't vote in George Washington
[1:22:59] if their life depended on it
[1:23:05] Teddy Roosevelt they tried to kill him
[1:23:07] over and over and over again but he
[1:23:09] finally got elected
[1:23:14] why you bring him up yes
[1:23:20] these men were hay
[1:23:23] hate it
[1:23:24] listen being hated as a politician is
[1:23:27] not a new thing
[1:23:33] it's in Chicago and he was getting ready
[1:23:34] to
[1:23:35] to speak a speech
[1:23:40] and a man a barber shot him
[1:23:43] in the chest
[1:23:45] foreign
[1:23:46] it went through his eyeglass cover
[1:23:50] and then through his speech went into
[1:23:52] his ribs stuck his hand
[1:23:55] in his in his in his side and pulled it
[1:23:58] out and it was all bloody and he said
[1:24:00] they shot me
[1:24:04] but I'm gonna still give your speech
[1:24:07] he said cause you can't shut me up
[1:24:10] and he spoke for 84 minutes
[1:24:15] on the man in the arena
[1:24:18] I have that hanging on my wall
[1:24:22] I have it in my library
[1:24:25] some of you gave me plaques of the man
[1:24:28] in the arena may I stand as a man in the
[1:24:31] arena unafraid
[1:24:35] as I said last week on that Resurrection
[1:24:38] morning
[1:24:39] George Washington's welcome here
[1:24:42] he may not be welcome in government or
[1:24:45] in any churches in this
[1:24:47] in this United States he's welcome here
[1:24:50] Abraham Lincoln is welcome here
[1:24:58] that conflicts with my political view
[1:25:02] you're dismissed
[1:25:05] they're dismissed
[1:25:16] just can I give a couple more statements
[1:25:18] here
[1:25:19] because in a woke
[1:25:24] they're in a woke movement
[1:25:26] and they don't even know what it is
[1:25:30] hell has has opened up its Gates
[1:25:34] that's woke
[1:25:37] but they're too late
[1:25:39] the bride woke up a long time ago
[1:25:59] and I want to make a declaration for you
[1:26:01] if this message did not awaken you for
[1:26:05] the rapture
[1:26:06] [Music]
[1:26:07] prepare yourself
[1:26:09] Thrift tribulation period
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:15] you have not seen bad times yet but
[1:26:19] they're coming
[1:26:23] [Applause]
[1:26:25] the seeds that have been sowed
[1:26:28] are now ready to be harvested
[1:26:32] Enoch knew as he trans preached
[1:26:36] and spoke the word there was a redeemer
[1:26:39] coming
[1:26:40] he was placing the Bible on the Earth
[1:26:45] and all of his work
[1:26:47] in all of his work and all of that
[1:26:51] there was one thing that was a constant
[1:26:54] in his life
[1:26:55] his atmosphere
[1:26:57] was walking with God
[1:27:01] I purposely tried to disturb your
[1:27:04] feelings in a few ways
[1:27:07] just today
[1:27:08] as of right now I am boycotting
[1:27:11] the news
[1:27:18] I'm tired of waking up every morning and
[1:27:20] seeing how many schools have been shot
[1:27:22] up
[1:27:24] all right
[1:27:27] I I I'm at a I'm at a point in my life
[1:27:30] to where I've had enough of politicians
[1:27:33] lies
[1:27:34] [Applause]
[1:27:36] lies
[1:27:40] brother Ron but I'm so concerned with
[1:27:42] the debt ceiling
[1:27:44] listen our America plant they they can
[1:27:48] print money at a moment's notice
[1:27:51] don't get yourself so tore up
[1:27:57] [Music]
[1:28:05] so you like and I like Enoch
[1:28:09] must walk in Two Worlds
[1:28:11] at the same time
[1:28:16] Enoch with all the perversion in his day
[1:28:20] and you must remember you must remember
[1:28:22] this
[1:28:23] God is a just God
[1:28:28] and so many talks about how mean God is
[1:28:33] God so mean
[1:28:34] God's so rough
[1:28:36] really
[1:28:38] you don't know the God I know
[1:28:43] I I literally love to surfing
[1:28:47] oh but he makes me dress a certain way
[1:28:49] that's your protection
[1:28:54] [Music]
[1:28:57] listen
[1:28:58] when he told you how to be married
[1:29:01] you can have a peaceful home
[1:29:08] love one another you don't have to raise
[1:29:10] your
[1:29:11] I'm not here to preach that but you can
[1:29:14] have a home to where you can feel the
[1:29:17] presence of God and literally it be so
[1:29:19] powerful until it feels like your hair
[1:29:22] is going to stand on your head at times
[1:29:24] that warm presence
[1:29:27] am I the only one
[1:29:30] [Applause]
[1:29:36] he's welcome
[1:29:41] he's welcome that's what this message
[1:29:43] produces
[1:29:46] that's what this message produces
[1:29:48] that's right
[1:29:53] that's right that's what this church
[1:29:54] produces
[1:29:57] young people that are truly Godly amen
[1:30:01] we're not a bunch of mixers
[1:30:05] we're not a bunch of halfway people
[1:30:07] we're real we're real I want to be real
[1:30:10] I want to be real I don't want to be put
[1:30:12] on I don't want to be fake
[1:30:14] I hate Halloween
[1:30:17] it's from the pit of Hell
[1:30:19] it's absolutely right from the pit of
[1:30:22] Hell I always taught my children it's
[1:30:24] from the pit of Hell because that's
[1:30:26] where it's from that's its Origins
[1:30:29] it's because a person can be a normal
[1:30:33] person all of a sudden put on a mask
[1:30:37] can put on a mask and all of a sudden
[1:30:39] they can play a character listen we
[1:30:41] don't want our church to be like that
[1:30:44] where you put on a fast mask
[1:30:48] put on a false mask and and all of a
[1:30:51] sudden you you you can act a certain way
[1:30:53] on Sunday but Monday it don't live
[1:30:57] what's the highest form of hypocrisy
[1:31:00] this should live 24 hours a day
[1:31:03] [Applause]
[1:31:20] brother Ron but I participate in
[1:31:22] Halloween stop
[1:31:23] it's not that difficult just stop
[1:31:26] it was a time in my life I drank beer
[1:31:29] Jesus came into my life I quit
[1:31:37] doctors told me Monday said
[1:31:40] don't don't put chocolate candy in your
[1:31:42] mouth I tell you what that's going to be
[1:31:44] a difficult thing
[1:31:58] somebody's watching your life
[1:32:04] most of the time it's your children
[1:32:05] that's right
[1:32:09] I told this last night I want to tell it
[1:32:11] today
[1:32:13] I mean it was there last night
[1:32:15] well good you guys know where to say
[1:32:17] Amen
[1:32:22] many years ago your father and I sat on
[1:32:25] a porch together with about 10 other
[1:32:27] preachers some brothers in the church we
[1:32:30] were fellowshipping
[1:32:32] there's a man sitting beside of me
[1:32:35] I knew him for years
[1:32:37] was a man sitting beside him he's not a
[1:32:39] preacher he wasn't a deacon he wasn't he
[1:32:41] was just a man of the church and was
[1:32:43] sitting there and
[1:32:46] I'm I don't try to ever be a rude person
[1:32:49] I I try I try not to be rude
[1:32:53] and you know he had a mustache and
[1:32:57] and then he had hair growing out of his
[1:32:59] nose
[1:33:01] and I've always thought that
[1:33:04] no that wasn't nice
[1:33:09] every time I'd look I see the hair in
[1:33:11] the nose you know
[1:33:18] and in the moment I caught his spirit
[1:33:22] Connie knows this is to be the truth
[1:33:25] and I said
[1:33:28] why haven't you quit that little habit
[1:33:32] and he just responded these words it's
[1:33:35] not hurting anybody
[1:33:40] and I said well you know your children
[1:33:43] are small they're playing here in the
[1:33:44] yard and your wife is in the house
[1:33:47] and I said this you know things are real
[1:33:49] good right now but
[1:33:51] your children's watching
[1:33:54] and as as your children grow up and now
[1:33:57] you're going to have to correct them
[1:33:58] because they're going to come to some
[1:34:00] spots to where you have to be their Holy
[1:34:02] Ghost
[1:34:03] and you have to stop them and say no
[1:34:05] don't do that
[1:34:07] don't don't do that
[1:34:09] and they're going to look at you and say
[1:34:10] but Daddy
[1:34:13] you know how long you've been doing that
[1:34:17] and there will come a time to where that
[1:34:19] you can't call them back to correction
[1:34:23] [Applause]
[1:34:25] and then your wife is is in there and
[1:34:27] she's going to look at you and she's
[1:34:29] going to know you've lived a
[1:34:31] hypocritical life they'll go into every
[1:34:33] service
[1:34:35] and one day and I said I'm going to
[1:34:37] prophesy to you one day there's going to
[1:34:39] come to time to work she's going to
[1:34:42] leave you
[1:34:46] his children grew up and that's exactly
[1:34:48] what happened
[1:34:50] I've actually had to talk to some of
[1:34:52] them
[1:34:53] and his wife came to a certain stage
[1:34:57] and now because of his hypocrisy
[1:35:01] now
[1:35:03] she's in love with another man
[1:35:06] of A different race
[1:35:09] left him married this other man
[1:35:14] it could have been corrected on a porch
[1:35:22] I'm preaching to you now
[1:35:25] I'm taking a story on her coming to your
[1:35:27] house
[1:35:28] oh brother Ron but it don't matter
[1:35:30] really
[1:35:34] really
[1:35:36] Matthew and myself are driving down the
[1:35:38] road and I said Matthew how long you
[1:35:40] been doing that
[1:35:42] I knew I couldn't hide it from you Daddy
[1:35:43] I said you hid it from me a long time I
[1:35:46] said but God showed it to me
[1:35:48] that moment Matthew repented
[1:35:53] that moment he repented wasn't something
[1:35:56] great big
[1:35:58] but it was something that down the road
[1:36:00] would have destroyed his home his family
[1:36:03] his health
[1:36:06] listen I want a preacher
[1:36:11] I want some real daddies
[1:36:14] some real men that will be men
[1:36:21] anybody can produce a baby but real man
[1:36:26] that'll be real Holy Ghost feel men
[1:36:37] I love God in my home I
[1:36:40] kind of hurt him
[1:36:45] I'm a little off Target here for a
[1:36:47] moment but
[1:36:49] there's not one thing I would ever do
[1:36:52] and I've had this policy forever
[1:36:55] that I would ever do
[1:36:58] to try to disappoint that girl
[1:37:04] I wouldn't want to hurt her
[1:37:09] I wouldn't want my conduct and my
[1:37:11] decisions
[1:37:14] and word to go back to her that would
[1:37:17] hurt her
[1:37:21] that's how much I love her
[1:37:24] because I love her like the scripture
[1:37:26] says more than myself
[1:37:29] and if you don't have that philosophy in
[1:37:31] your marriage
[1:37:34] listen when you get married
[1:37:36] it ain't the good old boy club no more
[1:37:39] it ain't the body system no more it
[1:37:42] ain't back when I was a teenager no more
[1:37:45] you're married you marry your best
[1:37:48] friend you marry your best buddy
[1:37:53] gaiman's over
[1:37:58] everything's over and if it isn't like
[1:38:01] that if you're not going into your
[1:38:03] marriage like that stop it
[1:38:10] Well Ron that's strong I told your kids
[1:38:13] that
[1:38:14] isn't that right
[1:38:16] it didn't hurt their feelings
[1:38:22] I try to tell every married couple that
[1:38:26] listen when your buddies think you think
[1:38:28] more of your buddies than you do your
[1:38:29] wife you're in trouble
[1:38:34] most of the time you want to hang out
[1:38:36] with your buddies more than you do your
[1:38:38] wife you're a homosexual
[1:38:49] who's your best friend brother Ron
[1:38:52] right there
[1:38:56] I got buddies
[1:38:59] sure I got buddies
[1:39:02] well right there's the best one
[1:39:05] we stepped out of Eternity into time
[1:39:09] and I got a promise we'll step back
[1:39:11] again
[1:39:13] by the way our wives look like sisters
[1:39:16] so we've got a good taste
[1:39:24] to what I'm talking about
[1:39:32] brother on those things have been
[1:39:34] difficult
[1:39:36] a little hard to swallow right in the
[1:39:37] middle of the sermon we was we were
[1:39:39] shouting a little while ago
[1:39:41] we're here to please God
[1:39:48] I want to have this testimony that God
[1:39:52] can say I have rights
[1:39:55] to Rapture him
[1:39:58] do you think that God in Enoch were the
[1:40:01] only parties that were involved
[1:40:04] there was enough there was an accuser of
[1:40:07] the brethren
[1:40:09] that was watching him build the Bible
[1:40:12] that was walking he's watching his
[1:40:14] atmosphere
[1:40:17] just to prepare you my next sermon of
[1:40:19] the week after I'm going to preach on
[1:40:21] sweeping sin under the rug
[1:40:25] so if you think these last few minutes
[1:40:26] have been tough
[1:40:28] you might want to schedule your vacation
[1:40:41] but the accuser of the Brethren was
[1:40:43] watching Enoch's walk
[1:40:47] and this is a phenomenal thought to me
[1:40:49] all of Hell could not affect Enoch
[1:40:54] great amen
[1:40:56] I want to bring it to your day
[1:40:59] Stephanie
[1:41:01] sister Stephanie
[1:41:03] if you could just Place yourself in the
[1:41:05] scriptures that I had you all and I'm
[1:41:07] not just calling her out I'm calling all
[1:41:09] of you out but I don't have time to call
[1:41:10] all your names
[1:41:12] Place yourself in the scriptures there's
[1:41:15] more than just two people in the in the
[1:41:17] party here God in you
[1:41:21] oh but it's it's Jerry and it's the baby
[1:41:23] and it's this and that
[1:41:25] let me just say this to you two of the
[1:41:28] men want to be taken it's an individual
[1:41:29] affair
[1:41:34] we're going to universally be raptured
[1:41:36] together but nobody's crutching one
[1:41:38] another up it's you and God
[1:41:41] it's you and my personal experience with
[1:41:44] God
[1:41:50] listen God don't send nobody to hell
[1:41:54] God say this with me God sends nobody to
[1:41:58] hell
[1:41:59] you send yourself to hell
[1:42:02] [Applause]
[1:42:05] songs preachers poetry
[1:42:09] and even even God wrote in the heavens
[1:42:12] we'll get to it in the morning God wrote
[1:42:14] in the heavens
[1:42:16] a sermon every time you have a storm
[1:42:21] God reminds you I'll not destroy the
[1:42:24] Earth
[1:42:25] with water
[1:42:33] I didn't finish
[1:42:36] but Satan no matter what he does
[1:42:38] do you Stephanie
[1:42:40] he can't get you
[1:42:49] that's pretty powerful
[1:42:52] it's pretty powerful
[1:43:03] and Enoch walk with God
[1:43:06] and he lived in Two Worlds
[1:43:16] I hear Brother Branham when he's up
[1:43:18] there he said that
[1:43:23] there was a storm coming
[1:43:27] and the storm was coming in it was a
[1:43:30] blizzard some of the brothers he
[1:43:31] instructed him to leave
[1:43:34] and they left there was a couple
[1:43:35] Brothers decided to stay
[1:43:37] and he said well I'll stay with you
[1:43:40] and he said when you start seeing the
[1:43:42] flakes fall
[1:43:43] he said you get back to the tent you get
[1:43:46] back to the camp as fast as you can
[1:43:49] brother Brandon was having a prayer
[1:43:50] meeting
[1:43:52] and he said the flake started falling he
[1:43:55] was in the kind of country to where
[1:43:56] there could be a foot of snow on the
[1:43:57] ground in a in a very quick moment
[1:44:00] and actually could be three feet in no
[1:44:03] time flat
[1:44:04] and brother random as well is is now
[1:44:07] getting ready to go back off of that
[1:44:08] mountain
[1:44:09] and he feels that presence of the Lord
[1:44:13] listen he knew what that was about
[1:44:17] I think that's something we need to know
[1:44:18] the presence of the Lord
[1:44:21] and God speaks to him and brother Brown
[1:44:23] takes off his hat
[1:44:27] now listen if he don't get back to that
[1:44:28] camp
[1:44:29] he's in trouble
[1:44:31] but God's more important than that storm
[1:44:36] and he and he told him
[1:44:39] he told him he says
[1:44:41] speak to that storm
[1:44:44] and he spoke to that storm
[1:44:48] your pastor told me this
[1:44:50] he told him about the speaking the storm
[1:44:54] out of existence
[1:44:55] he likened it unto the woman in Memphis
[1:45:00] that her son was dying
[1:45:04] of syphilis at 19 years old
[1:45:08] and in Memphis she was a nobody never
[1:45:11] heard of William Branham
[1:45:13] but she prayed a prayer
[1:45:15] where is my Elijah
[1:45:18] and that prayer didn't speak a storm out
[1:45:22] of existence but it brought one into
[1:45:24] existence that would ground his plane
[1:45:31] and two occurrences God speaks to him
[1:45:34] come walk with me
[1:45:36] God's calling us to a higher walk
[1:45:40] I believe that's what these sermons are
[1:45:42] about we're to a higher walk
[1:45:45] [Music]
[1:45:49] brother brennaman actually your pastor
[1:45:52] actually said how did you know which way
[1:45:54] to go
[1:45:56] and he said brother Branham said I
[1:45:58] turned and looked into a store window
[1:46:02] saw myself
[1:46:03] and I told God
[1:46:05] you you have to be my guide
[1:46:09] I look left and I look right saw a
[1:46:11] police officer
[1:46:13] and he begins to walk
[1:46:15] and he walks just a bit and he comes to
[1:46:18] a place where a woman
[1:46:20] has do on her back
[1:46:22] and brother Bram says good morning Amy
[1:46:25] good morning Parson
[1:46:29] how did you know I was a person
[1:46:31] early this morning
[1:46:34] and she begins to tell him early this
[1:46:36] morning I prayed a prayer where's my
[1:46:39] Elijah at
[1:46:41] she positionally placed herself in the
[1:46:43] scriptures
[1:46:48] she possessionally placed herself in the
[1:46:50] scriptures with with who she was like
[1:46:53] I'd be like that shudomite woman
[1:46:57] and she began to tell brother Branham
[1:46:59] about her son
[1:47:01] and brother man said when I walked in
[1:47:02] there
[1:47:04] the sign about God over the over the
[1:47:07] door he's welcome here
[1:47:10] he's welcome in my home
[1:47:14] so I walked in
[1:47:16] he says poor Shanty that's what he
[1:47:18] called it wouldn't be in derogatory
[1:47:20] brother Brian was a poor man himself
[1:47:24] very
[1:47:25] he said I walked in in the
[1:47:28] the walls were covered with newspaper
[1:47:31] I used to be a thing when when you
[1:47:34] didn't have money it didn't have money
[1:47:35] for paint
[1:47:37] you guys have it very well
[1:47:41] and she plastered her walls with
[1:47:43] newspapers
[1:47:44] my brother Brandon for those that want
[1:47:46] to fight with brother Branham
[1:47:49] say he was never prayed for King George
[1:47:50] brother Branham said I've been in four
[1:47:53] King's castles
[1:47:57] and I never felt more at home than I did
[1:48:00] in that house
[1:48:04] he said he was going oh
[1:48:08] ooh it's dark in here
[1:48:11] it's dark in here
[1:48:16] and he said Annie
[1:48:19] won't you pray
[1:48:23] things there's some things that you have
[1:48:25] to understand as a prophet
[1:48:27] he knew she called up the storm
[1:48:31] and if she had the power to call up a
[1:48:33] storm
[1:48:34] and the power to get him there
[1:48:37] she knew how to pray
[1:48:40] how much power do you have
[1:48:46] how much power
[1:48:50] is deposited on the inside of you
[1:49:01] brother Branham said he prayed for that
[1:49:03] boy
[1:49:05] a year later
[1:49:07] six months to a year later brother
[1:49:09] Brandon was on that in that part of the
[1:49:10] country on the railroad
[1:49:13] and he thought he'd get off and get
[1:49:14] himself a couple hot dogs and he said he
[1:49:18] said all of a sudden there was a boy
[1:49:19] hollering at him
[1:49:21] brother Brown brother Brown brother
[1:49:24] and he didn't recognize him he said I'm
[1:49:26] that boy
[1:49:27] [Applause]
[1:49:28] I'm that boy he said I'm a preacher now
[1:49:32] that boy
[1:49:34] come walk with me
[1:49:40] brother Brandon don't get off of that
[1:49:41] mountain
[1:49:42] he's going to die in that storm
[1:49:46] so he has to take the third pull and
[1:49:48] speak to that storm
[1:49:51] tell it to go back to where it came from
[1:49:54] brother Branham
[1:49:56] said the spirit of the Lord said come
[1:49:58] walk with me
[1:50:10] I believe that's what he's asking us to
[1:50:12] do
[1:50:14] if I can say anything to you as a pastor
[1:50:17] of this church
[1:50:19] let's walk with him
[1:50:25] the angel would tell brother Branham be
[1:50:27] more sincere
[1:50:30] if he needed that how much more do we
[1:50:33] need that
[1:50:37] come walk with me
[1:50:41] now no doubt you too have an accuser of
[1:50:44] the brethren
[1:50:46] but we've just heard tonight
[1:50:49] he can touch your flesh he can touch
[1:50:51] your spirit but he can't touch that seed
[1:50:56] he can't touch that seed
[1:51:00] and God has plans
[1:51:03] we've heard the message we've had the
[1:51:05] message at our disposal for all of these
[1:51:07] years we've been and most of us have
[1:51:10] been in the message all of our lives
[1:51:11] that casket that brother Royce
[1:51:13] Shrewsbury Stood Beside of I was four
[1:51:16] years old standing beside of that same
[1:51:18] casket
[1:51:20] I'm not a Schoolboy when it comes to the
[1:51:22] message
[1:51:26] my brother Ed's friend for many many
[1:51:28] years
[1:51:28] I cherish that
[1:51:31] we preached this message around the
[1:51:33] world
[1:51:35] and we've projected what God said that
[1:51:38] there's going to be a bride on the earth
[1:51:39] there's been churches churches and
[1:51:41] Brides brides but there must come one
[1:51:46] we've seen it in China
[1:51:48] we've seen it in Switzerland we've seen
[1:51:51] it all over the Earth
[1:51:53] we've been in many countries and see
[1:51:55] people with the same heart that you have
[1:51:58] people with the same desire that you
[1:52:00] have
[1:52:01] but we believe that this message is
[1:52:04] going to change our body
[1:52:07] and like Enoch he couldn't stay here we
[1:52:10] can't stay here
[1:52:13] there's something calling us higher
[1:52:17] this world don't mean much to us anymore
[1:52:20] and we're walking to another step
[1:52:23] [Applause]
[1:52:28] I finished with this
[1:52:31] Enoch came to a place
[1:52:35] he came to a place to where
[1:52:37] there was a latter provided for him
[1:52:41] brother Bram says it in several
[1:52:43] different places
[1:52:45] like Jacob a ladder to heaven God
[1:52:48] provided it
[1:52:51] a bridge God provided it
[1:52:54] lambskins God provided it
[1:52:57] God provided this message
[1:53:02] maybe you won't be here in the morning
[1:53:04] let me just say this to you when Noah
[1:53:07] preached and I just delivered this to
[1:53:09] you when Noah preached he preached the
[1:53:11] message that could have delivered them
[1:53:16] but they scoffed it and made fun of it
[1:53:20] and their unbelief
[1:53:23] brought on a flood
[1:53:25] [Music]
[1:53:27] people don't realize what's going on in
[1:53:29] the news
[1:53:30] their unbelief and sin
[1:53:36] is bringing on the tribulation period
[1:53:44] if I can say it and put it in words
[1:53:48] the water
[1:53:50] that flooded the Earth
[1:53:53] was the material
[1:53:58] was the very mature the material of
[1:54:02] their judgment
[1:54:05] the bombs that are hanging in Russia
[1:54:09] that people have made fun of your
[1:54:11] prophet
[1:54:14] is going to rain
[1:54:17] they're going to rain
[1:54:22] unbelief brought that
[1:54:28] a man weighed about 150 pounds
[1:54:31] with an angel with him
[1:54:34] and a pillar of Fire
[1:54:41] his message produced this church
[1:54:48] his message produced our church
[1:54:51] you guys we just preached our 50th year
[1:54:54] last year
[1:54:55] Jubilee our 50th years this year
[1:54:59] no man did this
[1:55:02] no man did this
[1:55:05] brother Frazier was it was inspired of
[1:55:08] God to do it
[1:55:11] I was inspired to come here
[1:55:15] brother Branham didn't do this
[1:55:18] God did this
[1:55:26] Enoch left home
[1:55:28] not realizing
[1:55:30] I'll not go back
[1:55:33] because today was the day
[1:55:41] I experienced something
[1:55:45] during the fire experience
[1:55:49] to where that I went brain dead and
[1:55:51] totally unresponsive
[1:55:54] and I remember the moments
[1:55:57] just before I was slipping away
[1:56:02] and here's some I didn't share this last
[1:56:04] night but here was some of the thoughts
[1:56:07] so this is what it's like to die
[1:56:11] and I felt myself to slip away
[1:56:16] the rest is history
[1:56:19] but I'm going to experience
[1:56:21] and experience one of these days
[1:56:24] so this is it
[1:56:27] and I'm going to turn my head and look
[1:56:29] in the mirror
[1:56:30] and I'm not going to be white-headed
[1:56:34] I was turning white-headed but chemo
[1:56:36] made sure I'd get that way
[1:56:40] I'm not going to need these anymore
[1:56:46] these are screwed on
[1:56:53] but I'm not going to need them no more I
[1:56:55] don't know where all those things are
[1:56:56] going to be at
[1:56:58] me a lot of junk on the ground as far as
[1:57:00] I know
[1:57:04] but this message

[1:57:47] special speakers

[1:57:54] our watch and go
[1:57:56] I'm not going to need that no more
[1:58:06] I got Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse on my
[1:58:09] watch
[1:58:11] and maybe I'll give this to somebody
[1:58:12] that really needs it for three and a
[1:58:14] half years
[1:58:16] because I'm not going to need this no
[1:58:17] longer
