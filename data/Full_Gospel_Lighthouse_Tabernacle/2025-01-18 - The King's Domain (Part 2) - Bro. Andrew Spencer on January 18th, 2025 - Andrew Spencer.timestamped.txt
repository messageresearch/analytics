[40:48] the best I can you know I want to kick
[40:50] it off with just telling you I was
[40:51] extrem and over the top of everything I
[40:53] did you know I grew up in a broken home
[40:56] and and and a lot of things that kids
[40:58] shouldn't have seen as I was growing up
[41:00] going through the party lifestyle and
[41:01] everything and as I progressed getting
[41:03] older and older you know I I love Sports
[41:06] Extreme Sports football played did
[41:08] everything I could do to have a good
[41:09] time you know and as I I progressively
[41:11] got older and got more into drugs myself
[41:13] and and doing my own thing and uh uh by
[41:16] the time I was you know I had a fighting
[41:18] Spirit too and by the time I was a
[41:20] senior in high school I got into it with
[41:22] the principal and wound up quitting
[41:24] school I wound up working at a
[41:26] restaurant I drunk driver ran through
[41:27] the building at Arby's and knocked the
[41:29] grease friers all over me and I had
[41:31] third degree burns all down my back and
[41:33] and my arms and my face and everything
[41:35] and I was in a hospital like a month and
[41:38] and by God's grace he kept me alive you
[41:40] know I didn't even know the Lord as my
[41:42] Lord and Savior and and and you know at
[41:44] that time I thought money was going to
[41:45] buy my happiness you know I had a buddy
[41:47] I throw in here I had a buddy of mine I
[41:49] was riding around with him he had got
[41:50] hurt and got some money and I said Lord
[41:52] I told my buddy I said I wish I could
[41:54] get hurt and get some money like you and
[41:55] it was the next day when I got burn burn
[41:57] so just throw it in there be careful
[41:58] what you wish for you know uh and uh you
[42:01] know I I I thought all this time that
[42:03] money was going to buy me happiness you
[42:04] know and you know come to find out later
[42:06] on in life that it was just an empty
[42:08] void that God put in us that you know I
[42:10] was longing to feel and you know as I
[42:12] got I got a little bit of money and all
[42:13] I did was just get worse at doing what I
[42:15] was doing you know but uh make a long
[42:17] story short you know I wound up having a
[42:19] bad motorcycle wreck almost died and uh
[42:21] uh wound up uh after after I got healed
[42:25] up I was like man I need to go back to
[42:26] church and uh
[42:28] uh I ended up getting invited to church
[42:29] too and uh it's the first time I've been
[42:32] in church in a long time and when I was
[42:34] there God started speaking to my heart
[42:36] and you know I ended up just kind of uh
[42:38] fighting it and going trying to uh run
[42:40] from the presence of God and I got going
[42:42] down the road and then just uh a still
[42:44] Small Voice told me I was walking away
[42:46] from God and I turned my truck around
[42:48] went back and I I just had conviction
[42:50] all over me I wound up uh uh finding
[42:52] that preacher and uh he led me to the
[42:54] Lord and and you know God put an anchor
[42:56] in my heart there I I didn't I didn't
[42:58] serve the Lord very long I you know I I
[43:01] encourage all you kids to get in
[43:02] Fellowship find fellowship with like
[43:04] Faith with some Believers you know get
[43:06] in and have some fun find you know we
[43:09] love to have fun as human beings you
[43:10] know find something fun to do and get
[43:12] get some good Fellowship but you know I
[43:14] didn't have it and you know like I said
[43:16] I I was grew up in a broken home I
[43:18] didn't have nobody to go to church or
[43:19] nothing and uh and uh uh I started
[43:24] backsliding you know obviously like two
[43:26] weeks later and I started running
[43:27] backwards you know I wound up uh having
[43:29] a motorcycle wre like I said I got to C
[43:31] for the horse there and uh but needless
[43:34] to say uh uh after I about died man the
[43:38] Lord uh uh I end up going to church and
[43:41] that's when I end up uh seeing my wife
[43:44] and and I end up uh wind up going out
[43:47] with her and wind up getting married and
[43:49] having some kids this is why I'm saying
[43:50] man I'm trying to rush my
[43:52] stories and I'm a little bit nervous and
[43:54] if it wasn't for the grace of God I I I
[43:56] never could have speak in p you know but
[43:58] uh now I just want to be a living
[44:00] representation of his power and
[44:02] demonstration of what he can do in our
[44:03] lives you know if I could just overcome
[44:05] my nerves a little bit but but uh you
[44:08] know uh uh you know God anyway God God
[44:12] placed an anchor down in my heart even
[44:14] though I started running backwards going
[44:15] the wrong way there was something in me
[44:17] and I can look back now and see that was
[44:18] that white dog black dog fight you know
[44:20] you know before I was just doing my
[44:22] thing living my life and you know I you
[44:24] know I love getting high and doing the
[44:25] things I did but you know when God come
[44:27] and turned my life around I was never
[44:29] the same you know now I had a battle in
[44:31] my life now now it was a constant war of
[44:34] me trying to be that old man that I
[44:35] didn't want to be that old man but you
[44:37] know I I did what I did not want to do
[44:39] you know like Paul you know so I felt I
[44:41] found myself in a in a bad situation
[44:43] there but uh after I got married and uh
[44:46] you know now my responsibilities are uh
[44:49] adding up I got a now we had a son and
[44:51] you know I began to use meth regularly I
[44:53] I was self-employed I did construction
[44:55] and and and I I drank all I woke up in
[44:58] the morning drinking beer before I left
[45:00] and by lunchtime I'd have a six-pack in
[45:01] me a lot of times and that was just just
[45:03] the way I Liv no matter where I went
[45:05] that's what I did I was drunk and hiding
[45:06] no matter what I was doing and uh as I I
[45:09] became more jealous and and more
[45:11] controlling over my wife and my wife she
[45:13] has a powerful testimony all the things
[45:14] I put her through you know but you know
[45:17] I I was running from God and I wound up
[45:18] getting in a highe speed Pursuit and uh
[45:21] W Up Wrecking out and then getting in
[45:22] all kinds of trouble and everything but
[45:24] you know God God knew what I needed and
[45:26] and as I end up getting laid up there in
[45:28] the hospital I mean laid up there in the
[45:30] uh in the jail you know I was mad at God
[45:33] CU I I told God I said there was anytime
[45:36] anytime you could have stepped in and
[45:37] done something all I wanted to be was a
[45:38] good husband and a good dad and he told
[45:41] me uh now you have nobody else to blame
[45:43] now you're blaming me and I said I'm
[45:45] sorry God it's all my fault and I woke
[45:47] up the next morning and I I open the
[45:49] Bible and it said my grace is sufficient
[45:51] for thee therefore my strength is made
[45:53] perfect in weakness and I opened the
[45:54] Bible again I flipped it again I just
[45:57] needing something from God and said
[45:58] there's no fear in love for perfect love
[45:59] cast out fear and by God's grace he
[46:02] delivered me there right there uh 12
[46:04] years of drug and alcohol abuse he
[46:06] delivered me of all my jealousy and all
[46:08] my temper and uh Set Me Free and I end
[46:11] up getting out and I and after I got out
[46:13] of jail God give me the Deliverance you
[46:15] know and I had to go through a drug
[46:16] court program and go through all these
[46:18] things and I was jumping through the
[46:19] hoops and doing what I had to do you
[46:21] know and I know I know where my life was

[46:28] brother in prison right now I got a
[46:30] sister committed suicide a couple years
[46:32] ago and uh you know so I know where I
[46:34] was going that was just the lifestyle I
[46:36] lived and and you know it's about seven
[46:38] years after that I was sitting in church
[46:39] and you know you know the Bible talks
[46:41] about when the Holy Ghost when he yet
[46:43] spake these words the Holy Ghost fell
[46:45] I'm sitting there in church and and God
[46:47] was speaking in my heart and he the song
[46:49] was Mercy rewrote my life and uh and God
[46:52] started speaking to me and he said why
[46:53] don't you quit smoking today I said I
[46:55] can't quit smoking today I'm going to
[46:57] Papa everybody in my family smokes he
[46:58] said why don't you hang out with like

[47:03] years of smoking he delivered me and set
[47:05] me
[47:11] free God's so awesome he he broke all my
[47:14] chains and set me free but then I hit a

[49:30] Life and uh you know sometimes God lay
[49:33] us you know the prophet T us sometimes
[49:35] God lay us on our back and look up and
[49:36] see where our great blessings come from
[49:37] and uh uh I had a um a main artery
[49:41] rupture on me and uh another funny one
[49:45] when I was down there in the basement I
[49:46] was going through it and man I was my
[49:48] back was I mean I had to excruciate in
[49:50] pain my wife was tripping and you know I
[49:51] was crying but I wasn't crying but just
[49:53] tears were coming out and uh and she she
[49:56] was like no we're going to hospital I'm
[49:58] like nah she was like yeah I said what
[50:00] you think the Cowboys did I said they
[50:01] cowboyed up she said no they
[50:04] died she walked out there and I I got
[50:07] think I'm like maybe she's right I'm
[50:09] like all right all right we'll go to the
[50:10] hospital so I end up going to hospital
[50:13] anyway so nless say it was more serious
[50:14] than I thought and they LIF flighted me
[50:16] and uh uh they LIF flighted me and uh uh
[50:23] I was in the hospital and everything
[50:24] they end up and this is where my life
[50:26] changed you know they end up I ain't
[50:28] never seen so many doctors in my life
[50:29] even after I got burned you know and
[50:31] everything uh here they all come in
[50:33] there and tell me how Mr Rich me your
[50:35] high priority here today and uh they're
[50:37] prepping me for Hope and art surgery and
[50:39] all this and everything and you know we
[50:40] got prayer warriors around the world
[50:42] praying for me and stuff and and they
[50:44] end up coming in there and uh we had to
[50:46] run another test and they came back and
[50:47] said it was type B and he come in there
[50:49] and starts telling me that there won't
[50:50] be no surgery you know he said but he
[50:53] asked me what I did I Tau him
[50:54] construction and stuff and he said well
[50:55] you won't be doing that no more you
[50:56] going to have to change your occupation
[50:58] and he asked me what I did for fun won't
[50:59] be doing none of that no more and you
[51:01] know so I was pretty overwhelmed with
[51:03] you know not going to be do he said I
[51:04] won't even be able to lift like five
[51:06] pounds and I'm like dude I said I said
[51:07] why don't why don't we go in there and
[51:08] fix it then or I said I said how long's
[51:11] a it take for a to a or the Dissection
[51:13] the heel he said a or the tear is always
[51:15] a tear it won't ever heal and he and I
[51:17] said well then why don't we go in there
[51:18] and fix it and he said because the type
[51:20] B that I have was more gastral it was
[51:21] more complicated of surgery the risk of
[51:23] me dying during surgery uh the odds was
[51:26] so high that they would just keep me on
[51:27] aggressive medication the rest of my
[51:28] life and so they had me on all this
[51:30] medication and everything and it
[51:32] suppressed my adrenaline glands and
[51:33] suppressed me all the way down that way
[51:35] I didn't have no you know any adrenaline
[51:37] or anything man and uh and
[51:39] so what you trying to mess with me and
[51:42] uh and so uh all right then yeah come on
[51:46] go
[51:48] ahead uh so you make me lose my train of
[51:52] thought
[51:53] man oh man uh
[51:58] yeah oh yeah so it made me lose all my
[52:00] adrenaline and everything that suck man
[52:02] you know everything you do man you I
[52:04] love always love to drin I love I was
[52:06] dren and junkie but now now uh anyway so
[52:11] at this time when he's telling me all
[52:12] this and I I'm start getting Plum
[52:13] depressed man because you know you can
[52:15] probably tell I'm a little bit energetic
[52:17] kind of guy now my whole life's changed
[52:19] and I'm like I'm thinking man I'm even
[52:21] thinking this time I'm like I'm not even
[52:22] going to be able to cut wood and split
[52:23] wood for my family and burn heat you
[52:24] know I'm thinking oh this what a burden
[52:26] I'm going to be and I actually got into
[52:28] a really dark spot I started getting
[52:29] real just in this depression just
[52:31] staring at the wall and I'm like I might
[52:33] as well get out here and end it and and
[52:35] I didn't want no visitors I told my wife
[52:37] I didn't want nobody and my end up uh I
[52:39] end up calling my buddy my buddy that
[52:41] wound up leading me to the message and
[52:43] uh I'm talking to him and he was like he
[52:45] said well you got to look God's word he
[52:46] said you got to look it was a miracle
[52:48] you didn't have to have surgery and it
[52:49] was a miracle that you didn't die on the
[52:51] way to the hospital and by the way it's
[52:52] like 75 85% die on the way of the
[52:54] hospital with what I had and and uh uh
[52:58] he said and God's word says by my
[52:59] stripes you're healed and it was like a
[53:01] it was like a little voice of something
[53:04] I'd be healed and it was like I said
[53:05] Jesus turn the lights on for me gave me
[53:07] some hope instead of wanting to get out
[53:09] of here and end it it gave me a little
[53:10] bit of Hope and a little bit of
[53:11] inspiration you know I started wearing a
[53:13] little prayer croth and started
[53:14] believing and started professing and and
[53:16] started walking on down the road and and
[53:18] uh I had another doctor come in there on
[53:20] his lunch break and he was sitting there
[53:21] talking to me about El hunting and stuff
[53:23] and he was like he's like man he asked
[53:24] me about sleep at me if I ever been
[53:25] tested I said and all they was looking
[53:27] at all my oxygen levels I was dropping
[53:29] down to like 80s my heart rate was like
[53:30] 38 it was dropping way down there and
[53:33] everything he was like yeah he said you
[53:34] need to be getting checked out so here I
[53:36] am it's about two weeks at home I'm
[53:37] sitting at home I know I'm trying to
[53:39] speed up now I know I've been D running
[53:40] on but I'm sitting at home about two
[53:42] weeks later I'm sitting there at the uh
[53:44] sitting there eating uh soup at my table
[53:46] there and I'm sitting there I'm like man
[53:48] I guess I need to get checked out for
[53:49] sleep apne and the Lord spoke to my
[53:51] heart and said will you believe the same
[53:52] God healed your aord could heal you that
[53:54] and I said I do and instantly God God
[53:56] God touched my life and I quit having
[53:57] all the issues that I was having with
[53:59] asleep apnea at night so God healed me
[54:01] asleep apnea and then he started dealing
[54:03] with me on a a justification and
[54:05] sanctification and he started seeing me
[54:07] because I made him some promises when I
[54:08] was laid up in in the hospital and by
[54:10] God's grace he he showed me my
[54:12] sanctification process then he filled me
[54:14] with the Holy Ghost and and he put me in
[54:17] power for service and you know get me up
[54:18] here and talk when I could never talk
[54:21] you know so by God's grace here we are
[54:23] power and
[54:24] demonstration uh so God started
[54:27] elevating my faith and building up my
[54:29] faith like David and Goliath so that was
[54:30] just a start of it you know and then
[54:31] brother Ron calls me out out there you
[54:33] know and uh y'all will probably see all
[54:36] that on the testimony but brother Ry
[54:38] calls me out and God was using them
[54:39] things to inspire my faith you know and
[54:41] then I had uh I had a bush hog fall on
[54:43] my foot it was like a 3600 lb bush hog
[54:45] fell on my foot and Cav my foot in and
[54:47] me and my father-in-law barely got it
[54:49] off I think an angel lifted it up and
[54:51] when I looked down my foot and was all
[54:52] caved in I'm like oh my goodness that
[54:53] peace came over me I stood up and I said
[54:56] Paul Shook at serpent off said no deadly
[54:58] thing going to harm him and I walked it
[55:00] off my my father and I HT his back and I
[55:01] prayed for him went on about my business
[55:03] came back later on and hooked the bush
[55:05] hog up started bush hogging and then the
[55:07] Lord just spoke to my heart that he's a
[55:08] very present help in a time of need and
[55:10] so God started elevating my faith you
[55:12] know because uh uh uh I I was believing
[55:15] for complete deliverance you know I'm
[55:16] not going to be on this medication CU
[55:18] God's word says by my stripes you're
[55:19] healed so I started believing you know
[55:21] I'm starting God's starting to work on
[55:23] my life and uh I had a buddy of mine
[55:25] he'd been struggling with with meth you
[55:26] know uh for uh like 10 years he come
[55:29] clean to me and I I knew he needed to be
[55:30] led to the Lord I said well alls I know
[55:32] is we can create an environment where
[55:34] the Lord feels welcome we can fast we
[55:36] can pray we can listen to sermons and
[55:37] you know just have church where two or
[55:39] three are gathered in the midst he'd be
[55:41] well as it was coming down to it he
[55:42] flakes on me and the Lord spoke to me
[55:44] and said what about me and you I said
[55:45] let's go yes so I went on so I started
[55:47] fasting and praying and I'm going
[55:49] through it and God God started dealing
[55:50] with me and I'm off my medication and
[55:52] everything I start I check my blood
[55:53] pressure I remember checking my blood
[55:55] pressure it was through the I'm like oh
[55:57] man and and he had told me it was like
[55:58] there was something I must do Peter had
[56:00] to take that first step onto the water
[56:02] so I had to take that first step and as
[56:04] I he I am out here on the water you know
[56:06] you know you got all these fears they
[56:07] told me I they actually told me I would
[56:09] die if I quit taking my medication so
[56:11] here I am now we're out here walking on
[56:12] the water and the waves are crashing you
[56:14] know you got all them all what the
[56:15] doctors and the Devils try to tell you
[56:17] but we got God's word you know and so
[56:19] God God was allowing me to uh uh go
[56:22] through this and then and as I checked
[56:24] my blood pressure I remember the sermon
[56:25] I was watching he said there's no
[56:26] retreat in God's Army we're only
[56:28] pressing forward so I just kept on
[56:30] marching on I woke up the next morning I
[56:32] checked my blood pressure it was through
[56:33] the roof again I'm like oh man I just
[56:35] expected it's going to be perfect and
[56:37] then I was like you know what I said far
[56:38] as I know you're lying to me and I went
[56:40] in there and I put it in in the kitchen
[56:42] cabinet and I stood up and he said uh
[56:44] it's not every day you can risk Dying by
[56:45] taking me of my word he said but man
[56:47] shall not live by bread alone but every
[56:49] word to proceed out of mouth of God and
[56:51] I realized at that point I was walking
[56:53] talking living breathing by God's word
[56:55] amen and now now that's where he's
[56:58] changed my life he's became a a real
[57:00] reality the word made flesh again in my
[57:03] life because he said I'm the Lord thy
[57:05] God that heals all thy diseases blessed
[57:07] be the name of the Lord so now we see
[57:10] that you know like brother Ry or John
[57:11] Ryan you know we don't we don't care
[57:14] what we feel like we know what God's
[57:16] word says blessed be his name and he has
[57:20] spoke to my heart and just showed me
[57:22] that you know I'm a billboard for the
[57:24] gospel the good news who Christ says
[57:26] free is free indeed I'm only a
[57:28] reflection of him God hung his billboard
[57:30] way up high on the cross for the world
[57:32] to see he said in Isaiah by my stripes
[57:34] you are healed and he was wounded for my
[57:36] transgressions huh and so now I'm
[57:39] reflecting him in the living
[57:41] manifestation with power and
[57:42] demonstration he said in John 3:30 I
[57:45] must decrease so he can increase and my
[57:47] story wouldn't be my story if it wasn't
[57:48] for Jesus Christ that's why I like to
[57:50] lift his great name up and magnify his
[57:52] great name if it wasn't for the grace of
[57:54] God where would we all be but here we
[57:56] are united in Christ under this revealed
[58:00] word for our day you know what an honor
[58:02] and privilege it is to sit here around

[1:09:56] constantly raising her up and putting
[1:09:59] the enemy back under her feet father I
[1:10:03] pray that tonight by the preaching of
[1:10:05] the word that you would come and
[1:10:06] minister to us Lord Jesus we we are
[1:10:10] subject to this world and subject to Le
[1:10:12] osia but I pray that you would begin to
[1:10:15] allow the Holy Spirit to roll over our
[1:10:18] lives and minister to us in a specific
[1:10:20] way and let the fire of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:22] burn the coldness of Le osia out and
[1:10:25] that you would just come Lord Jesus Lord
[1:10:27] we are a needy people we have needs that
[1:10:30] you would Minister and only you can so
[1:10:33] we invite you the almighty God to come

[1:10:39] holds but we are so thankful to know
[1:10:41] that you're holding it and we invite you
[1:10:43] Lord Jesus just to our Pew just now and
[1:10:46] just to kind of get ourselves out of the
[1:10:48] way just for a minute that you'd not
[1:10:49] only anoint the speaker but you would
[1:10:51] anoint the hearer as well and that the
[1:10:53] Holy Ghost would come
[1:10:55] and we would say wasn't it good for us

[1:11:04] preaching of the word and God we
[1:11:06] dedicate our life to you Lord I
[1:11:09] sacrifice myself father Lord for your
[1:11:12] service just now in the name of Jesus
[1:11:15] Christ amen and amen if you have your
[1:11:18] Bibles this evening wouldd like to look
[1:11:19] over in the Book of Ecclesiastes chapter
[1:11:22] 8 and Revelations chapter 3 3
[1:11:26] Ecclesiastes chapter
[1:11:30] 8 Revelations chapter
[1:11:53] 3 how many loves the Lord Lord
[1:11:59] amen well we would say that's almost a
[1:12:02] stupid question you wouldn't be here if
[1:12:05] you didn't love him that's right amen
[1:12:07] we'd like to just continue on with a
[1:12:09] thought that the Lord's laid on our
[1:12:11] heart for this weekend on the king's
[1:12:14] domain amen Ecclesiastes chapter 8
[1:12:17] verse4 declares that where the word of a
[1:12:20] king is there is power and who may say
[1:12:24] unto him what doest thou Revelations
[1:12:27] chapter 3 and verse
[1:12:29] 20 this is Jesus speaking here to the to
[1:12:33] the last Church
[1:12:35] age he says behold I stand at the door
[1:12:39] and knock and if any man hear my voice
[1:12:42] and open the door I will come in to him
[1:12:45] and will s with him and he with me to
[1:12:48] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[1:12:49] with me in my throne even as I also
[1:12:54] overcame and him sat down with my father
[1:12:57] in his throne he that hath an ear let
[1:13:00] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:13:02] churches may God bless his
[1:13:05] word you may be seated in the presence
[1:13:08] of the Lord and we as we said we'd like
[1:13:10] to take a thought on the king's domain
[1:13:13] brother
[1:13:14] Barham uh would say in the message how
[1:13:17] can I overcome he said did you notice
[1:13:20] the arrangements of that see set with me
[1:13:23] in my Throne not on my throne but in my
[1:13:26] Throne he said that's in his domain now
[1:13:30] as Christ is the ruler Throne ruler at
[1:13:33] this time of the complete domain of God
[1:13:37] so will the church be with him the bride
[1:13:40] be with him in his throne in the entire
[1:13:44] domain see not on my throne but in my
[1:13:47] Throne see where his domain reaches a
[1:13:50] throne is over a domain and a domain
[1:13:54] reaches just as as far as it boundaries
[1:13:56] does and this is from eternity to
[1:13:59] Eternity just think of it just think of
[1:14:02] it you see so we realize that the
[1:14:04] believer's domain is from eternity to
[1:14:08] Eternity and we realize that God has
[1:14:10] released a specific people in this hour
[1:14:14] at a specific time and we realize that
[1:14:16] if we're going to run in this race that
[1:14:18] we want to do with everything that is
[1:14:20] within us and we know that God has has
[1:14:22] preserved a special class of people that
[1:14:25] are going to be known as not just
[1:14:27] survivors of leysia but they're going to
[1:14:29] be known as the Overcomers of Le oosa
[1:14:32] and we realize that it is one of the
[1:14:34] darkest of days because we realize that
[1:14:36] even when William brandham was drawing
[1:14:38] these things out in the seven Church
[1:14:40] ages we realize that brother brandham
[1:14:42] actually said that he said the Lord
[1:14:43] allowed me to draw some light in there
[1:14:45] and that light is you now Paul would say
[1:14:48] in the in the message of Hebrews 12 and
[1:14:51] 28 when he is writing out this letter
[1:14:53] that he said now wherefore we receiving
[1:14:55] a kingdom which cannot be moved let us
[1:14:58] have Grace whereby we may serve God
[1:15:00] acceptably with reverence and godly fear
[1:15:03] and William Brandon picks that up in the
[1:15:05] message on the world is again falling
[1:15:07] apart he says now how do we get into it
[1:15:09] for we receive a kingdom that cannot be
[1:15:11] moved he said how do we get into it he
[1:15:13] said it's not by a religious system but
[1:15:15] a kingdom of God is within you say that
[1:15:17] that he the kingdom of God is is is
[1:15:20] within you let's say that together the
[1:15:22] kingdom of God is within you theing
[1:15:25] Kingdom the king and his word is the
[1:15:27] same it's within you vindicating the
[1:15:30] hour that we are now living the promise
[1:15:32] that God made for this age here we are
[1:15:35] living with the king living with the
[1:15:38] King sitting in Heavenly places watching
[1:15:41] him do doing these things we are sitting
[1:15:45] here together in Heavenly places
[1:15:47] watching him do these things now we
[1:15:50] realize that that that we have seen some
[1:15:52] very powerful things a very powerful
[1:15:54] testimony where we we could go back all
[1:15:56] the way in the message and we could pull
[1:15:57] out Georgie Carter we could pull out we
[1:15:59] could pull out Congressman Upshaw but we
[1:16:01] realize that we are sitting in the same
[1:16:04] place that Congressman Upshaw was
[1:16:05] sitting in and we're sitting in the same
[1:16:07] spot that Georgie Carter was setting in
[1:16:09] and we're sitting in the same spot that
[1:16:11] that little bitty old woman that had
[1:16:12] cataracts that wrapped around her eyes
[1:16:14] that we're sitting here in the same
[1:16:16] place and we realized that the things
[1:16:18] that we're doing and what we are
[1:16:19] watching we are watching him move in
[1:16:22] action and in power and ined and we
[1:16:25] realize that God has God our king is not
[1:16:28] sitting here he's not wasting Potentials
[1:16:30] in this hour but he has deposited a
[1:16:32] certain thing in this hour he's not
[1:16:34] wasting he's not wasting his potentials
[1:16:37] by simply just letting it out there and
[1:16:39] to see if it'll come to pass or not but
[1:16:41] you see whatever God has for you is for
[1:16:44] you it ain't for somebody else it ain't
[1:16:46] for another generation that's coming
[1:16:47] back to finish this but you are the
[1:16:49] final Voice through the final age so so
[1:16:51] what God has for you here in this layot
[1:16:53] ofy and church age there is no reserves
[1:16:56] if I could say it that way there there's
[1:16:58] not a bank up in heaven that God is
[1:16:59] saying I've got to hold this back for
[1:17:01] such and such time or I've got to hold
[1:17:03] these things back or I got to reserve a
[1:17:04] little bit of power but we realize that
[1:17:06] in this hour that the days of holding
[1:17:08] back are over if we could say it that
[1:17:10] way because God is releasing all of the
[1:17:13] almighty everything that he is he has
[1:17:15] poured out in the Church of the L osia
[1:17:18] and he is showing it there as a token in
[1:17:20] this generation that the days of holding
[1:17:22] back are over what Martin tried to
[1:17:25] what he tried to thrive at what Luther
[1:17:27] tried to thrive at what Wesley tried to
[1:17:29] thrive at that day is right here right
[1:17:32] now I believe that we are running a race
[1:17:35] and I believe that we ought to run with
[1:17:37] everything that's that is within us I
[1:17:39] believe that all of Heaven is counting
[1:17:41] on you and I and that the king and his
[1:17:43] word are exactly the same and the reason
[1:17:46] why there's such power in this hour is
[1:17:48] that there is a Oneness that has been
[1:17:50] brought by the mighty angel that the
[1:17:52] king and the word are exactly the same
[1:17:55] now you remember what William Brandon
[1:17:56] would say in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:17:58] revealed he said now it was the anointed
[1:18:00] man but now it's the anointed people why
[1:18:03] it's the anointed people by anointed by
[1:18:05] accepting what Eve turned down you see
[1:18:08] what she turned down it put her out of
[1:18:10] perfection but what you and I are
[1:18:12] accepting it is placing us right back
[1:18:14] into Perfection you see she started
[1:18:16] eating off the tree of knowledge she
[1:18:18] started eating off of it and it placed
[1:18:20] her out of perfection but you have been
[1:18:22] feeding not on the tree of knowledge but
[1:18:24] you have been feeding on the tree of
[1:18:26] life and it has placed you right here in
[1:18:28] Satan's Eden back into Perfection as the
[1:18:31] body of Jesus Christ now we we are very
[1:18:34] familiar with this quote but I I want to
[1:18:36] preach this I want to preach this to you
[1:18:38] if I can out of the revelation of Jesus
[1:18:41] Christ in the church age book brother
[1:18:43] Ron would say now have you ever noticed
[1:18:45] how Satan hates two books of the Bible
[1:18:47] more than all others he said through
[1:18:49] Theo uh through liberal theologians and
[1:18:52] pseudo scientists he is always a
[1:18:54] attacking the Book of Genesis and the
[1:18:56] Book of Revelation he said in both of
[1:18:58] these books we find Satan's origin and
[1:19:01] his awful ways and his destruction that
[1:19:03] is why he attacks him now you can just
[1:19:06] imagine just for a minute of walking
[1:19:08] into a to a dark room where it's filled
[1:19:10] with all kind of hidden dangers and and
[1:19:12] to a father you know exactly what I'm
[1:19:14] talking about by walking into a walking
[1:19:16] into your child's room in the dark and
[1:19:18] you step on a Lego it's all kinds of
[1:19:19] dark it's all kinds of danger that are
[1:19:21] laying out there you see you see they
[1:19:24] just imagine that as as you begin to
[1:19:26] walk into a dark room that that you
[1:19:28] can't see the hidden dangers that are
[1:19:29] there but all you got to do is go on
[1:19:31] over there and cut on the light and you
[1:19:33] can see all the traps that are around
[1:19:35] you and you can you can see how to get
[1:19:37] around every Hazard because of bright
[1:19:39] light it makes all of the hazards become
[1:19:42] visible and allows you to be able to
[1:19:43] navigate safely through all the troubles
[1:19:46] you see the reason why Satan hates the
[1:19:48] Book of Genesis and the Book of
[1:19:50] Revelation is because these books are a
[1:19:52] lot and it shows and Reveals His origin
[1:19:56] it shows his method and it shows his
[1:19:58] ultimate defeat so we realize that Satan
[1:20:01] can operate but he cannot operate
[1:20:03] effectively because there is a
[1:20:05] revelation that has been shown in this
[1:20:06] generation and this light that has been
[1:20:09] shown in this generation it exposes
[1:20:11] Satan for what he is and the Bible said
[1:20:13] in John 1 and5 that the light shineth in
[1:20:16] darkness and the dark comprehended it
[1:20:18] not so if we can look at it in another
[1:20:21] translation it says that the light is so
[1:20:24] powerful that the darkness cannot
[1:20:26] overcome it so the troubles that you're
[1:20:29] going to go through and the dangers that
[1:20:31] you're going to walk around the
[1:20:32] revelation of the Malachi 4 preaching
[1:20:35] the message of the hour gives you the
[1:20:37] ability to walk around all the dangers
[1:20:39] of Le
[1:20:41] osia now he goes on to say he hates to
[1:20:43] be exposed and in those books he is
[1:20:46] exposed for exactly what he is and he
[1:20:48] said Jesus said about Satan he has no
[1:20:51] part in me and I have no part in him he
[1:20:53] said the devil would like to prove that
[1:20:55] different but he cannot so he does all
[1:20:57] that he can to destroy confidence in the
[1:20:59] word but when the church disbelieves
[1:21:01] Satan and believes the spirit revelation
[1:21:04] of the word the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:21:06] Prevail against
[1:21:09] her when the church disbelieves Satan
[1:21:12] and believes the spirit's revelation of
[1:21:14] the word the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:21:17] Prevail against her you remember when
[1:21:19] the when the Prophet Elijah is
[1:21:21] confronted by the by the prophets of
[1:21:23] Baal and Elijah standing up there on
[1:21:25] Mount Carmel and there becomes a a a a
[1:21:27] great challenge of the hour whether God
[1:21:30] was God or whether the prophets of Baal
[1:21:32] were really representing the god that
[1:21:33] they were talking about but you see what
[1:21:36] what showed the difference was when
[1:21:38] Elijah began to talk to almighty God
[1:21:40] that he started talking and praying to
[1:21:42] almighty God and fire came down and it
[1:21:44] exposed all the false gods and it showed
[1:21:47] that they had a powerless nature about
[1:21:49] them that's what the message of the hour
[1:21:51] has done it has shown and exposed Satan
[1:21:54] that he has a powerless nature that he
[1:21:56] ain't nothing but a lying Devil he's
[1:21:58] going around like a roaring Lon seeking
[1:22:01] whom he may devour but we realize that
[1:22:03] that old line that Old Devil he ain't
[1:22:05] got nothing but a bunch of bark about
[1:22:07] him he ain't got no teeth in his mouth
[1:22:09] because the teeth have been smashed out
[1:22:12] at
[1:22:14] Calvary that's what the message did it
[1:22:16] exposed the false gods of this hour
[1:22:19] brother ROM said now now he said now
[1:22:21] going on he said let me show you another
[1:22:22] reason why Satan hates us Book of
[1:22:24] Revelation of Jesus Christ in the church
[1:22:27] he knows Satan knows that Jesus Christ
[1:22:31] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:22:33] and it changes not and he knows that a
[1:22:35] whole lot more than 90% of theologians
[1:22:38] do ain't that
[1:22:39] powerful that Satan knows that Jesus
[1:22:42] Christ is the same yesterday day and
[1:22:43] forever more than 90% of theologians
[1:22:49] do so I don't care I don't care what
[1:22:52] class you put yourself in if you know
[1:22:54] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:22:56] you're doing a whole lot better than
[1:22:58] theologians are he said he knows that
[1:23:01] since God is immutable in his nature
[1:23:03] then he is just as immutable in his ways
[1:23:06] thus Satan knows assuredly that the
[1:23:09] original Church of Pentecost with the
[1:23:11] power of God Mark 16 in action is the
[1:23:14] true church that Jesus claims as his own
[1:23:17] all else is false it has to be I love
[1:23:20] this he says now remember this I love it
[1:23:23] when you go through the script and you
[1:23:24] start looking at a prophetic word a
[1:23:27] prophet's word and he starts he starts
[1:23:29] pointing back he starts showing things
[1:23:31] to the people of that generation and
[1:23:33] William brandom standing here he said
[1:23:35] now remember this now remember this now
[1:23:38] this is one thing you want to catch is
[1:23:39] when William brandom is going through
[1:23:41] the message and he says now be careful
[1:23:43] to catch this make sure that you get
[1:23:45] this he said now remember this Christ in
[1:23:47] the true church is a continuation of the
[1:23:50] book of Acts so you're not going to be
[1:23:52] able to tell the difference between them
[1:23:54] it's going to be a continuation you see
[1:23:57] you can tell the difference in chapters
[1:23:59] is when a different author takes over
[1:24:01] but there's no change in authors here
[1:24:03] but the same author that wrote the first
[1:24:06] book of Acts is the same author that is
[1:24:08] right in the second book of Acts there
[1:24:10] is no change over in authors just the
[1:24:14] players are different instead of it
[1:24:16] saying Paul it now says Jordan instead
[1:24:18] of it saying Peter it now says Gabriel
[1:24:21] instead of it saying William brandom it
[1:24:23] now says you
[1:24:29] but the Book of Revelation shows how the
[1:24:31] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[1:24:32] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[1:24:35] formal and Powerless it exposes Satan
[1:24:39] revealing his Works attempted
[1:24:41] destruction of God's people and
[1:24:43] discrediting of God's word right down to
[1:24:45] the time that he's cast into the Lake of
[1:24:47] Fire he fo that he cannot stand it he
[1:24:52] knows Hallelujah that's one thing when
[1:24:55] you know it and it's one thing when God
[1:24:57] knows it but when Satan knows it that if
[1:25:01] the people get the true revelation of
[1:25:03] the true church and what she is and what
[1:25:06] she stands for that she can do the
[1:25:08] Greater Works and she will be an
[1:25:11] invincible Army that means that you will
[1:25:13] be Unstoppable by Satan but the church's
[1:25:18] invincibility it lies in Discerning and
[1:25:21] resisting the Antichrist spirit in this
[1:25:23] hour
[1:25:24] you see there has something very
[1:25:26] powerful about the body of Jesus Christ
[1:25:28] she is the most Discerning people that
[1:25:30] there is on the face of the Earth you
[1:25:32] can tell whether it's real or not
[1:25:34] there's a lot of people can sing the
[1:25:35] house down and then there there's
[1:25:37] something special about a holy ghost
[1:25:39] filled son and daughter of God you can
[1:25:41] see a reality between her between her
[1:25:44] and the churches of the world is because
[1:25:46] there is a reality to it there's a power
[1:25:49] behind it and so your invincibility is
[1:25:52] lying and destined upon discrediting
[1:25:55] Satan's
[1:25:56] kingdom and it lied right there in
[1:25:59] resisting the Antichrist Spirit you see
[1:26:02] there's a lot of there's a lot of famous
[1:26:04] artwork out there in the world today
[1:26:05] there's a lot of there's a lot of nice
[1:26:07] things of of artwork or paintings but
[1:26:10] you see there there's a lot of
[1:26:12] counterfeits out there as well amen
[1:26:14] there's a lot of counterfeits out there
[1:26:15] in the world and and if you're in that
[1:26:17] stage of where you're looking at certain
[1:26:19] things there's there's counterfeit
[1:26:20] paintings that that that deceive many of
[1:26:22] people I could go in to go in there and
[1:26:25] pull out some of those counterfeits that
[1:26:26] have had fooled some of them experts but
[1:26:28] I just want to point out this but until
[1:26:30] an expert shows and reveals the flaws in
[1:26:33] it you see you see you'll just think
[1:26:35] it's just like everybody else you'll
[1:26:37] think it's a real thing but when the
[1:26:39] expert eye goes in there and it starts
[1:26:41] revealing the flaws it begins to expose
[1:26:43] it that it's a fact that it's a fake in
[1:26:46] the reality of it you see that's what
[1:26:48] Revelation does to the Church of the
[1:26:50] Living God it is an expert eye that
[1:26:53] reveals Satan is a counterfeit that he
[1:26:56] could be working in the name of church
[1:26:58] he could be acting in the name of a
[1:26:59] church but Revelation is the expert eye
[1:27:02] that shows that Satan what he's doing
[1:27:04] this hour is a
[1:27:07] counterfeit he said now if they get a
[1:27:09] true revelation of the two Spirits
[1:27:11] within the framework of the church and
[1:27:13] by God's spirit discern and withstand
[1:27:15] the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[1:27:18] powerless before her let say it together
[1:27:22] Satan will be powerless before her he
[1:27:25] will be as defitely thwarted today as
[1:27:27] when Christ wasto stood every effort to
[1:27:29] gain power over him in a desert yes
[1:27:31] Satan hates Revelation but we love it
[1:27:34] with true Revelation in our lives the
[1:27:36] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us
[1:27:39] but we will prevail against him you
[1:27:42] remember over in the book of kings that
[1:27:43] you'll find that that there was a king
[1:27:45] by the name of Aram and and there he be
[1:27:48] to make out War tactics of where he was
[1:27:51] going to move throughout the land of
[1:27:52] Israel here and there and he would set
[1:27:54] up his kingdom and he was going to go
[1:27:55] fight here or fight there and then they
[1:27:58] come to find out that that before they
[1:28:00] could ever get there they that that that
[1:28:02] the armies of Israel already knew where
[1:28:04] that King Aram was going to be at and he
[1:28:07] actually got mad thought well I've got a
[1:28:09] I've got an Insider in here that's
[1:28:10] beginning to tell begin to tell my War
[1:28:12] tactics before we ever get there on the
[1:28:14] Battleground and they come to find out
[1:28:16] it wasn't nobody else but Elijah there
[1:28:19] that was in that land he started telling
[1:28:21] that the Bible said that Elijah knew the
[1:28:23] very secrets of the king's heart even in
[1:28:26] his bed chamber they started telling
[1:28:29] well it ain't none of us we ain't turned
[1:28:31] on your king AR but it's a prophet up
[1:28:33] there can you imagine in this generation
[1:28:36] before before Russia ever was Russia
[1:28:39] they was known as a Soviet Union could
[1:28:41] you imagine that all of a sudden Russia
[1:28:43] gets noised that there's a prophet in
[1:28:45] 1933 that starts screaming out watch
[1:28:48] Russia watch Russia that there's
[1:28:50] somebody that knows what we're going to
[1:28:51] do before we ever get there
[1:28:54] you got to think that they didn't become
[1:28:56] they didn't become a Mother Russia into
[1:28:58] the 70s and ' 80s but there was a
[1:29:01] prophet that saw what Russia was going
[1:29:03] to become the King of the
[1:29:06] North I say this there's a God on your
[1:29:11] [Applause]
[1:29:12] side there's a God on your side that
[1:29:15] already knows that the enemy is going to
[1:29:18] be
[1:29:19] defeated he already knows the plans of
[1:29:21] Satan yes yeah imagine that'd be a
[1:29:24] pretty good deal if the Washington
[1:29:26] Redskins could actually figure out what
[1:29:27] the lions were going to do before they
[1:29:29] ever got there it'd be a pretty good
[1:29:31] game if they already knew every play
[1:29:33] that was that they was getting ready to
[1:29:34] come out of it'd be the very first time
[1:29:36] that they would actually actually have a
[1:29:37] winning chance on their
[1:29:39] side but you and I have a better chance
[1:29:43] than the than the Kansas City Chiefs or
[1:29:45] the Washington Redskins or any ball team
[1:29:48] out there we've had a God that has lined
[1:29:50] out the map of where Satan is going to
[1:29:53] be at and and he had a prophet stand
[1:29:55] there said don't go there don't go there
[1:29:58] but if you're going to worship Worship
[1:30:00] in the place that I choose to put my
[1:30:04] [Applause]
[1:30:08] name before the enemy could ever get
[1:30:12] there God had already surrounded the
[1:30:16] enemy he going to go up there and attack
[1:30:18] Elijah it's gonna go up there attack
[1:30:19] William Brandon so they set up his plan
[1:30:21] to have this meeting up there and will
[1:30:24] brandom had already found out what the
[1:30:26] plans was and said it ain't going to be
[1:30:28] in this room it'll be in that
[1:30:30] room and you might be worried about
[1:30:32] what's going to happen with the message
[1:30:34] and what's going on with this and what's
[1:30:36] going on with that I want you to know
[1:30:37] that there's more surrounding us than
[1:30:40] the enemy that is trying to surround us
[1:30:42] that before the enemy ever gets into the
[1:30:44] picture God's got Angel armies that are
[1:30:47] at his demand that all he has to do is
[1:30:49] say go forth now you might get shook up
[1:30:52] and say where are they at All I'm gonna
[1:30:54] say is like Elijah God opened up their
[1:30:57] eyes that they might see there's more
[1:30:59] with us than there is against
[1:31:01] [Music]
[1:31:03] us
[1:31:05] hallelujah Billy Graham would tell a
[1:31:07] story about a missionary that was that
[1:31:10] was going over over into a foreign
[1:31:12] country he from Scotland the missionary
[1:31:14] was he went over he went over into uh in
[1:31:17] a foreign country and and and these
[1:31:20] these uh these tribes were so upset they
[1:31:23] were so up upset that they uh that this
[1:31:25] missionary and his family was coming in
[1:31:27] there spreading the name of Jesus Christ
[1:31:29] and they got so got so worried about it
[1:31:31] and so shook up they got so mad that he
[1:31:33] was spread in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:31:34] that they threatened they was going to
[1:31:35] kill him and that night when the
[1:31:37] missionary was was going to bed and
[1:31:39] everything that tribe that created a mob
[1:31:42] and they were coming out there they
[1:31:43] going to kill this missionary and his
[1:31:44] family Billy Graham said that that that
[1:31:47] that night that when they got there the
[1:31:49] tribe got all the way around this
[1:31:51] missionary and and the mob a and and the
[1:31:54] mob had to leave and by by by the
[1:31:55] morning came the missionary said nothing
[1:31:58] had happened and they knew that they
[1:31:59] knew that they was coming for him but
[1:32:01] nothing happened well years later Billy
[1:32:04] Graham said at that missionary he met
[1:32:06] that he met that guy and that that mob
[1:32:09] leader over that tribe and the that mob
[1:32:11] leader had actually became a Christian
[1:32:13] at that time and gave his heart over to
[1:32:15] Jesus Christ and he said he said I want
[1:32:18] to ask you about that night that you was
[1:32:20] coming down there and you you you was
[1:32:21] planning to kill me and my family he
[1:32:23] said how no well could we attack you he
[1:32:25] said when we got down there he said it
[1:32:27] was hundreds and thousands of men
[1:32:29] standing down there with swords in their
[1:32:31] hands he said huh I didn't have no Army
[1:32:34] dispatched but all of Heaven had an army
[1:32:36] that was dispatched you may not see them
[1:32:38] in this room it's more than a story of
[1:32:41] Elijah and Gesa but there's a
[1:32:44] bride that is on this earth that is
[1:32:47] surrounded by Angel
[1:32:50] armies you see true Revelation is the
[1:32:53] key to overcoming Satan's
[1:32:56] schemes brother Adam we got too much
[1:32:58] base and not enough whatever else I need
[1:33:01] I'm not a sound guy I just know it don't
[1:33:03] sound right true Revelation is the key
[1:33:05] to overcoming Satan's
[1:33:08] schemes is that right it's a true
[1:33:11] Revelation it's the key to overcoming
[1:33:13] Satan's schemes just like when Jesus is
[1:33:16] up there on the mountain in Matthew
[1:33:17] chapter 4 that he goes up there after
[1:33:19] receiving the Holy Ghost and the Bible
[1:33:21] said that the tempter came to him and
[1:33:23] said if thou be the Son of God cast
[1:33:26] these stones and turn these stones from
[1:33:28] stones into bread and Jesus said it is
[1:33:30] written man shall not live by bread
[1:33:32] alone but by every word that proceeds
[1:33:34] out of the mouth of God then he takes
[1:33:36] him Upon A Pinnacle says cast your th
[1:33:38] self bound and the angels the scripture
[1:33:40] said that the Angels would bear thee up
[1:33:42] again and Jesus said it is written Thou
[1:33:45] shalt not tempt the Lord thy God then he
[1:33:47] again takes him up and the Bible said
[1:33:50] that he showed him the kingdoms of the
[1:33:52] world he said Not only did it say that
[1:33:55] he showed him the kingdoms of the world
[1:33:57] but it showed the glory of this world he
[1:33:59] brought him up to modernday New York he
[1:34:02] brought him all the way over to the
[1:34:04] greatest of things in India and he
[1:34:06] showed them all the glory of
[1:34:08] it Jesus knew he didn't have to fall to
[1:34:10] that trap because he already knew that
[1:34:13] they was going to fall air to him in the
[1:34:15] Millennium so when Jesus was tented in
[1:34:18] the wilderness and Satan started
[1:34:20] twisting the scriptures to deceive him
[1:34:22] Jesus didn't use power he used the word
[1:34:25] of God to defeat Satan and expose
[1:34:29] Satan's lies so the word it is written
[1:34:32] becomes a weapon in the hands of God's
[1:34:34] children to say get behind me
[1:34:38] devil get behind me devil I don't care
[1:34:41] what he's tempting you about just stand
[1:34:43] there say get behind me I don't care if
[1:34:46] he's trying to make you heal yourself or
[1:34:48] not say get behind me devil I don't care
[1:34:50] if he's trying to show you that you
[1:34:52] ain't got power to come out of
[1:34:53] Temptation say get behind me
[1:34:56] [Applause]
[1:34:57] devil this ain't his domain this is your
[1:35:03] domain you remember when Smith
[1:35:05] Wigglesworth he was standing there and
[1:35:06] he was getting ready to get on a he's
[1:35:07] getting ready to get on the bus and this
[1:35:09] little woman he said the woman come out
[1:35:10] there and she was she was out there and
[1:35:12] she was standing and all of a sudden her
[1:35:14] little bitt dog run out there and she
[1:35:16] said get on back here honey you can't
[1:35:18] come with me today and all of a sudden
[1:35:20] she she looked down and said get behind
[1:35:22] me go ahead go go on honey you can't
[1:35:24] come with me today and the bus pulled up
[1:35:26] and she saids you got to go on home when
[1:35:28] she got on the bus and the little dog
[1:35:30] tried to get on there and the woman said
[1:35:32] get
[1:35:33] back Smith looked at her said that's why
[1:35:35] you got to talk to the devil on that's
[1:35:38] right that devil wants to hang around
[1:35:40] you and torment your mind torment your
[1:35:42] spirit have a talk with him and say get
[1:35:45] back
[1:35:46] home this ain't this ain't your
[1:35:49] playground this ain't your mind this
[1:35:51] ain't your spirit this ain't your soul
[1:35:54] get
[1:35:58] back this ain't Satan's domain this is
[1:36:02] your domain it's for you it's for our
[1:36:05] young people it's for our middle class
[1:36:07] it's for the upper class it's for the
[1:36:09] middle age it's for the poor and it's
[1:36:12] for the rich it's the name of Jesus
[1:36:15] Christ and it is a protection against
[1:36:17] every FL that the enemy brings against
[1:36:19] the Church of the Living God
[1:36:25] well somebody give God
[1:36:35] praise and we realize we're talking
[1:36:39] about a domain it's a realm or
[1:36:42] territory where one that is in power he
[1:36:45] begins to exercise his authority and he
[1:36:47] rules and he governs and he's got people
[1:36:50] that are under his jurisdiction and Paul
[1:36:52] goes in there I'm not going to read it
[1:36:53] to you just for time sake but Paul goes
[1:36:55] in there in Ephesians chapter 6 and said
[1:36:57] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:36:59] Lord and he lays out the protection for
[1:37:02] God's children in this domain and he
[1:37:04] starts showing in there that this domain
[1:37:07] isn't what you're facing is you're not
[1:37:09] wrestling against you're not wrestling
[1:37:11] against powers in the natural but you're
[1:37:13] wrestling against things that aren't
[1:37:15] tangible things that you can't see but
[1:37:17] you can feel the effect of them and Paul
[1:37:20] is laying in there that you have power
[1:37:23] you have power to make them Powers be
[1:37:25] subject unto you that you have the
[1:37:27] ability to make principalities and
[1:37:30] powers and rulers of the Darkness Be
[1:37:32] subject to you you see because when you
[1:37:36] are in a domain there are things that
[1:37:38] are in that domain that aren't
[1:37:40] necessarily feeling or tangible but it
[1:37:43] it actually it shows that that King has
[1:37:46] the power over influence he has the has
[1:37:49] the effect and power and the
[1:37:51] responsibility of those things that are
[1:37:53] within his realm now I love what William
[1:37:55] brandom said when he we starts talking
[1:37:57] about he goes down to Hell how that
[1:38:00] Jesus goes down to Hell and he he goes
[1:38:02] down through there and he drops off a
[1:38:03] package he drops off your sin and he
[1:38:06] goes on down there and there's Satan
[1:38:08] waiting on him there's Satan waiting on
[1:38:10] him he said I waited for you I look for
[1:38:12] you in job I I look for you in Daniel I
[1:38:15] look for you in all the prophets I look
[1:38:17] for you and able but you're finally here
[1:38:19] and I love what William brandham does he
[1:38:22] literally turns it around
[1:38:24] and he said now this ain't your domain
[1:38:26] he said but this he said Satan said he
[1:38:29] said now you find me in my domain that's
[1:38:33] what William brandham said that Satan
[1:38:35] said that that you're now in my domain
[1:38:39] well it wasn't his for long because
[1:38:41] Jesus showed up in Satan's domain and
[1:38:44] took all of his power away from him
[1:38:46] William brandham said he drop kicked
[1:38:48] Satan and pulled the keys off of him of
[1:38:50] death hell and the grave so therefore
[1:38:53] you have the ability as a son and
[1:38:55] daughter of God to say the enemy that is
[1:38:58] tempting you and the enemy that is
[1:39:00] fighting against you don't have the keys
[1:39:02] to his own
[1:39:03] [Applause]
[1:39:05] house now let me ask you something if
[1:39:08] you got the keys to your house you can
[1:39:11] go in and go out when you please but
[1:39:13] when you don't have the keys when you
[1:39:15] don't have the keys your ax has been H
[1:39:18] your exess has been shut off so if he
[1:39:21] says you're going to die with suicide
[1:39:23] our almighty God has already shut the
[1:39:26] door off to that devil if he says you're
[1:39:28] going by cancer he's already got the
[1:39:30] keys to that in his
[1:39:31] [Applause]
[1:39:34] hand Hallelujah you see that's why Jesus
[1:39:38] would stand there and he starts showing
[1:39:41] his kingdom when a man comes to him by
[1:39:44] night and he begin to tell him said now
[1:39:45] Master we know that thou art sent from
[1:39:48] God for only God can do the things that
[1:39:51] you're doing and Jesus has a
[1:39:53] conversation with him and said verily
[1:39:55] verily absolutely absolutely I say unto
[1:39:58] you except a man be born again he cannot
[1:40:01] see the kingdom of God brother Maron
[1:40:04] picks that up and why I'm against
[1:40:05] organized religion he said Born Again
[1:40:08] means a new birth from above birth from
[1:40:12] above then we are active in the things
[1:40:15] from above oh my for it is himself
[1:40:17] acting in his word through you his
[1:40:20] Branch to the vine he said that's the
[1:40:23] the reason that Jesus said if I do not
[1:40:25] the works of my father believe me not
[1:40:28] you see that's what makes a kingdom or
[1:40:31] we could change out that word there and
[1:40:32] we could say family we could say a
[1:40:34] business we could say a home that's what
[1:40:36] makes a kingdom or a family so powerful
[1:40:40] is that when you could say is that when
[1:40:42] you can say that the subjects is that
[1:40:45] the subjects are subjected to the king's
[1:40:47] demands or the boss's demands or the
[1:40:50] father's demands that they that the
[1:40:53] Kingdom actually moves by the Kingdom's
[1:40:56] influence by the king's power whether
[1:40:59] the king is there or whether the king is
[1:41:02] not there because they recognize as a
[1:41:05] family that whether you're there as a
[1:41:07] head of your home or not they recognize
[1:41:09] that they're representing the
[1:41:11] head or you could say well you know it's
[1:41:14] a very hard thing when you can find
[1:41:15] somebody that actually work come on come
[1:41:18] on and then actually represent the boss
[1:41:20] there's a lot of people that know how to
[1:41:22] do good things when the boss is around
[1:41:23] come
[1:41:25] on are you with me there's a lot of
[1:41:27] people that know how to do good things
[1:41:28] when the boss is looking but when the
[1:41:30] boss ain't looking or when the husband
[1:41:32] ain't home or when the when the daddy
[1:41:34] ain't around on it shows that you're
[1:41:37] still under the influence of the king is
[1:41:40] when the king's not around and when the
[1:41:42] king ain't looking that you're still
[1:41:44] acting and moving according to the
[1:41:46] king's demands that this is what he
[1:41:48] wants
[1:41:49] done that's why he said there's a
[1:41:51] Harmony between the bride and the
[1:41:54] bridegroom she knows what he wants done
[1:41:56] with the word now we know he's not
[1:41:59] hearing his physical body but he's
[1:42:00] hearing a bride coming of Jesus Christ
[1:42:02] so she knows what he wants done with the
[1:42:05] word so what he saw when Congressman
[1:42:07] Upshaw he wants to see it in
[1:42:10] you what he saw in Geor G Carter when
[1:42:13] she laid there for n years but she had
[1:42:15] the faith of Abraham that said I'm
[1:42:17] coming up out of this bed he's wanting
[1:42:20] the same thing out of you is that right
[1:42:25] you see that shows the real power of the
[1:42:29] king it's maybe he's all fighting
[1:42:32] another battle but his Queen still knows
[1:42:36] that this is what he wants
[1:42:39] done there's a lot of times when you
[1:42:42] recognize you're in the presence of
[1:42:43] almighty
[1:42:44] God like you are right now and you sense
[1:42:47] the pillar of fire moving through the
[1:42:48] building all of a sudden it makes Joy
[1:42:51] shouts break out and all of a sudden a
[1:42:52] super natural manifest but when the
[1:42:54] supernatural isn't there and when you
[1:42:56] don't feel it do you still act the same
[1:42:59] way that you do right here or do you
[1:43:01] still handle yourself the same way that
[1:43:03] you do right here as on Monday you see
[1:43:05] that's what makes the Kingdom so
[1:43:07] powerful is it doesn't just resist or it
[1:43:09] doesn't just assist and live in one
[1:43:12] place but the power of the Holy Ghost is
[1:43:14] with you on your job it's with you in
[1:43:16] your economy it's with you when you're
[1:43:18] driving down the car the power of the
[1:43:20] Holy Ghost that's Hallelujah it doesn't
[1:43:23] matter whether you feel him or whether
[1:43:24] you don't but King knows he can trust
[1:43:28] [Applause]
[1:43:32] you you remember brother you remember to
[1:43:36] me it's what makes the story of the
[1:43:38] King's son so powerful is that even
[1:43:40] though he wasn't in his kingdom he was
[1:43:43] still representing his kingdom you
[1:43:45] remember when the slave broker was
[1:43:46] standing there said I I want that man he
[1:43:48] said well he's not for sale he said well
[1:43:50] do you feed him different do you treat
[1:43:51] him different he said oh I don't feed
[1:43:53] him different or treat him different he
[1:43:54] said I wanted the same thing you see but
[1:43:56] I found out that back in his homeland he
[1:43:59] was a King's son so he handled himself
[1:44:02] like a King's son even though he was in
[1:44:05] circumstances of being beat and
[1:44:07] tormented and things that he didn't even
[1:44:09] want to be done to him but just because
[1:44:12] he was going through a trial did not
[1:44:15] change the circumstance that he was a
[1:44:17] King's son the devil may have robbed
[1:44:20] everything from you but it doesn't
[1:44:22] change a circumstance that you are
[1:44:25] predestinated by almighty
[1:44:27] [Applause]
[1:44:30] God come on your circumstances don't
[1:44:33] change your
[1:44:34] predestination it proves it that's
[1:44:39] right M
[1:44:42] drop let Satan come let him torment your
[1:44:45] mind let him torment your family you're
[1:44:48] still a King's
[1:44:49] son let him Rob your health you're still
[1:44:52] a King's son let him try to steal your
[1:44:54] family you're still a King's son let him
[1:44:56] try to Rob your business from you you're
[1:44:59] still a King's son let him try to tell
[1:45:02] you that it's for days gone by you're
[1:45:04] still a King's son and if a king is over
[1:45:07] top of a kingdom and he's got children
[1:45:09] in a land he knows there's still
[1:45:12] power right
[1:45:14] Amen to
[1:45:16] operate like a
[1:45:20] king there's a lot of people that
[1:45:22] brother ROM would call him
[1:45:24] fundamentalist and then he'd call him
[1:45:26] Pentecostal he said there's a lot of
[1:45:28] people that know the scriptures on it he
[1:45:31] said but they don't know who they are he
[1:45:32] said then you got Pentecostals he said
[1:45:34] they know who they are but ain't got no
[1:45:36] power to back it up he said oh if I
[1:45:38] could only get the man that's got the
[1:45:40] money in the bank with the check the
[1:45:41] guys that's got the ability to write the
[1:45:43] check he said if I could ever tie them
[1:45:45] together you see that's what the Holy
[1:45:47] Spirit has done by the anointing of the
[1:45:49] mighty angel coming down in this
[1:45:51] generation it's given you a re that you
[1:45:53] got power and you got
[1:45:57] ability your ability is not in your own
[1:46:01] self it's in the apparence of the
[1:46:06] king you're never going to have no power
[1:46:09] unless you have an encounter with the
[1:46:13] king I
[1:46:15] I I'm going to dance around this but
[1:46:17] there was an individual that one time
[1:46:19] asked how did you get that power like
[1:46:22] you got now was just talking talking to
[1:46:23] the ministry said how did you get that
[1:46:25] power like you got how how did you get
[1:46:27] where you are well nobody put us here
[1:46:31] amen God put you here that's how how do
[1:46:34] you get that power how do I how do I
[1:46:36] develop that kind of ministry how do I
[1:46:38] do how do I how do how do how how
[1:46:43] how I think it's
[1:46:45] amazing it's the difference is that God
[1:46:48] had had somebody that had an encounter
[1:46:50] with it there's a lot of people that
[1:46:52] long for the holy ghost that you got but
[1:46:54] they never had an encounter with it you
[1:46:56] see Moses was a was a fine example of
[1:46:59] having an encounter with the King now
[1:47:01] he'd been acquainted with Kings and
[1:47:02] Pharaohs of different lands down there
[1:47:04] in Egypt but there was something
[1:47:05] different about about being On The Backs
[1:47:07] side of the desert you see you see what
[1:47:09] makes Moses's story so great to me is
[1:47:12] that Moses got to a spot that he
[1:47:14] believed in the king enough that he
[1:47:16] wanted to meet him for
[1:47:17] himself and that there he was on the
[1:47:19] backs side of desert and he looked like
[1:47:21] a Shepherd but really he was a King in
[1:47:23] action because there's something
[1:47:25] powerful about learning the ways of a
[1:47:26] Shepherd before you can become a king or
[1:47:28] a ruler over top of situations now let
[1:47:31] me just give you a full picture of this
[1:47:33] here's a man that's got a got a bad case
[1:47:35] of sunburn on him he's got a bad stutter
[1:47:37] and he walks around in a with a stick in
[1:47:39] his hand and he talks to bushes come
[1:47:44] on that's our
[1:47:47] leader that's old stuttering Mo up there
[1:47:49] got power up there talking to a bush
[1:47:52] right now you think alcatra had thems a
[1:47:55] good problem down there trying to figure
[1:47:56] out how them three four guys got
[1:47:58] themselves out of that but here's a guy
[1:48:00] that stutters talks to talks to a bush
[1:48:02] and carries a stick in his hand he's
[1:48:03] getting ready to walk out and have the
[1:48:05] most recorded jailbreak that's ever took
[1:48:08] place where two million people walk out
[1:48:10] in one night yeah he may have been
[1:48:12] stutter maybe maybe he did have a
[1:48:14] conversation with a bush up there but
[1:48:16] the power was is that the power left the
[1:48:19] bush and came on no
[1:48:21] m you see that's what makes a difference
[1:48:24] between you and the rest of the world is
[1:48:26] the power left the bush and came onto
[1:48:29] you that Pillar of Fire has everything
[1:48:32] that you're
[1:48:33] [Applause]
[1:48:37] lacking I'd say oh mo could give us a
[1:48:39] talk couldn't you I was up there and I
[1:48:42] was talking in this bush and all of a
[1:48:43] sudden that Bush started telling me that
[1:48:45] I am the great I am and I'm going to go
[1:48:47] down there and I'm sending you I have
[1:48:49] heard their cries I've heard them talk
[1:48:50] about leosia I've heard them talk about
[1:48:53] the problems that Satan had given them
[1:48:54] right here in the midst of it but tell
[1:48:56] them not to worry the I am is coming
[1:48:58] down to deliver them come on somebody
[1:49:01] what do you got in your hand little
[1:49:02] bride it's not a king sword but it's the
[1:49:05] king
[1:49:08] sword you imagine
[1:49:11] Joshua down there all the Israelites
[1:49:13] they down there and they working they
[1:49:15] working all the day long brother Jerry
[1:49:18] and I'd say they got to a spot in their
[1:49:19] life that they actually hated working in
[1:49:21] the Sun that they was looking for some
[1:49:23] shade every once in a while because they
[1:49:24] got sick and tired of building bricks
[1:49:26] for people they wern't going to they W
[1:49:28] going to live in them bricks but they
[1:49:29] was building bricks for these these
[1:49:31] Hypocrites and he's building bricks for
[1:49:33] people that acted like they love Joseph
[1:49:35] at one time but now they're down there
[1:49:37] building out bricks for somebody I'd say
[1:49:39] they got to a spot that they hated
[1:49:40] working in the sun that's right but you
[1:49:43] know what's so powerful to me is that
[1:49:45] Joshua was down there and he was working
[1:49:47] on them he was working on them bricks
[1:49:49] too and he knew what it took to overcome
[1:49:51] all them bricks because God had somebody
[1:49:54] that was in Authority that knew how to
[1:49:56] build them bricks but when he got over
[1:49:58] there in Jericho he knew what kind of
[1:50:00] power that it was going to take to throw
[1:50:02] down them walls because they had
[1:50:04] somebody that built them now there's
[1:50:06] something powerful about somebody that
[1:50:08] knows how to build something they're
[1:50:10] typically pretty good at tearing down
[1:50:11] things too and Joshua recognized that he
[1:50:15] didn't have the power on the inside of
[1:50:17] him to tear it down but he was standing
[1:50:20] there with a king that had a sword in
[1:50:22] his hand
[1:50:23] and so this is how you're going to do it
[1:50:25] you're going to walk around it for
[1:50:26] silence for six days through six Church
[1:50:29] ages but on the seventh age you're going
[1:50:32] to walk around it seven
[1:50:34] times and when you walk around it on the
[1:50:36] seventh time the days of small things
[1:50:39] that have been rejected and the days
[1:50:41] that things that things have gone by I'm
[1:50:44] going to release
[1:50:46] it come on there's a people that despise
[1:50:49] the day of small things but this ain't
[1:50:52] no small thing to the Church of the
[1:50:54] Living God it's now time that your
[1:50:57] message gets
[1:51:02] sounded remember when Brother Joseph
[1:51:04] hammed came here and preached he said
[1:51:06] until our shout meets our Miracle
[1:51:10] matches our Miracle then the miracle
[1:51:13] will never take place but when I
[1:51:17] shout the message matches the miracle
[1:51:21] let me say this to you
[1:51:23] Wesley's message could not meet the
[1:51:25] answer for this generation I love
[1:51:27] everything I I've studied Wesley I've
[1:51:29] studied Luther I've looked through it
[1:51:31] but they didn't have no power to get me
[1:51:32] out of here come on somebody Moses's
[1:51:35] Authority stopped when he died and
[1:51:38] Joshua simply car sorry say that let me
[1:51:41] bring that back again Moses affecting
[1:51:43] the human as a human it stopped when he
[1:51:46] died but there was a man that gathered
[1:51:48] what Moses
[1:51:50] said there's somebody that gathered
[1:51:52] William brandham said William brandham
[1:51:55] as a man can't do no more for you but
[1:51:57] his effect is still working in a people
[1:52:01] called the body of Jesus
[1:52:03] Christ and Joshua starts taking what
[1:52:06] Moses said and he said I'll meditate on
[1:52:09] these things day and night be strong and
[1:52:11] courageous everywhere I step I'm going
[1:52:13] to step right there exactly where the
[1:52:15] message said step my Joshua didn't have
[1:52:17] to create some new message that's right
[1:52:19] all Joshua had to do was preach the same
[1:52:21] message that's right that's right you
[1:52:23] ain't got to go out and create some new
[1:52:24] reel or some new tape all you got to do
[1:52:27] is say what the prophet already said I'd
[1:52:30] say Joshua got sick and tired of looking
[1:52:32] that son down in Egypt but he was
[1:52:33] standing there in Joshua chapter 10 he
[1:52:36] instead of him hating that son he loved
[1:52:38] that son because he needed that son to
[1:52:40] stand still so the same thing that he
[1:52:42] hated was the same thing that he loved
[1:52:45] and he turned it around and he used the
[1:52:47] power of the son to destroy his enemy
[1:52:50] that's right
[1:52:51] [Music]
[1:52:54] Hallelujah you still love the
[1:53:01] Lord Brother man would say it like this
[1:53:04] he said now you don't have to knck down
[1:53:06] to the devil we got a law That's the Law
[1:53:10] of the Holy Spirit the only thing you
[1:53:11] have to do is know how to let go and let
[1:53:16] God
[1:53:17] Lord he said but you keep fighting at
[1:53:20] and say well that won't never work he
[1:53:21] said when you let go and let God and he
[1:53:24] goes on to say that that if a fish said
[1:53:26] well I wait I'll just catch my breath
[1:53:28] real good and I'll breathe in a little
[1:53:29] bit of oxygen and said I'll see how far
[1:53:31] I can go down he said that little fish
[1:53:33] he said he's going to burst he said if
[1:53:35] the bird says I I'll see how fast I can
[1:53:37] run down here maybe I'll take off no he
[1:53:39] won't do it he'll fall down he said you
[1:53:42] see he's got to know how to control how
[1:53:44] that law can control
[1:53:46] him he said and that's the same way it
[1:53:48] is with us it isn't what we fight and
[1:53:51] what we pull and hurry oh if I could if
[1:53:54] I don't get this if I don't get that
[1:53:56] that's not it it's to know that the law
[1:53:58] of life is in you you just got to let go
[1:54:03] and let God he said then he takes you to
[1:54:06] your healing then he takes you to the
[1:54:08] baptism of the spirit or anything that
[1:54:09] he's promised any claim that he's given
[1:54:12] you it's yours by letting go and letting
[1:54:16] God now we're going to get to some power
[1:54:19] here he said if the officer he said that
[1:54:21] was going to take the fellow that broke
[1:54:23] in there and stole your property he was
[1:54:25] going to take him to the court and you
[1:54:27] keep pulling the officer back and say
[1:54:28] well I I don't know whether should do
[1:54:30] this or not he'll never get the guy
[1:54:32] there he said but you got to let him
[1:54:35] go you keep calling the law and telling
[1:54:38] them that the devil has come in there
[1:54:40] and tried to Rob your family you can't
[1:54:43] hold him
[1:54:44] back let him go you keep getting
[1:54:48] tormented with lust you can't pull the
[1:54:50] law officer back let him go
[1:54:52] [Applause]

[1:54:55] bless your finances but you keep pulling
[1:54:57] back and not paying your ties you got to
[1:54:59] let him
[1:55:00] go you keep asking God to heal you but
[1:55:03] you keep pulling them back by by taking
[1:55:05] what a doctor said over what God said

[1:55:41] let God turn hisself loose on your
[1:55:50] problem let him go

[1:55:57] everything I got this figured out
[1:55:59] somebody somebody on Instagram showed me
[1:56:02] how to overcome so I'm just going to do
[1:56:03] it that way no you're
[1:56:04] not somebody told how to do it on

[1:56:10] of how to overcome Temptation and lust
[1:56:13] and problems no you're not you going to
[1:56:16] still live with that same devil but if
[1:56:18] you can ever turn the power of the Holy
[1:56:20] Ghost loose come on somebody why don't
[1:56:23] you let him loose why don't you let
[1:56:25] Christ take over and let him Express
[1:56:28] himself through you you don't have to
[1:56:30] settle for anything less than the power
[1:56:33] of the Holy Ghost of of just barely
[1:56:35] getting by barely living a Christian
[1:56:37] Life let him go it belongs to the Church
[1:56:41] of the Living God the Holy Ghost is here

[1:56:47] tracks call The Enforcer of the law and
[1:56:50] let him go yes H
[1:56:56] Hallelujah I don't care how big your
[1:56:58] problem is let the Holy Ghost loose on
[1:57:01] it I feel I feel
[1:57:03] like I feel like shouting right now I
[1:57:06] feel like somebody's catching and they
[1:57:08] turning something loose in the
[1:57:10] atmosphere stop holding on to your
[1:57:12] demons stop holding on to your problems
[1:57:14] stop holding on to what you know and
[1:57:18] sometimes what you're holding on to is
[1:57:20] tradition
[1:57:27] that's the way Homer Fraser did it
[1:57:28] that's the way Roby that's the way
[1:57:29] brother Roby Turner did it that's the
[1:57:31] way Henry green did it that's the way
[1:57:33] this one did it let it
[1:57:35] [Applause]
[1:57:37] go that's the way Paul did it that's the
[1:57:39] way Peter did it that's the way William
[1:57:41] brand did it let let God do
[1:57:44] [Applause]
[1:57:49] it come on somebody
[1:57:53] come on I wish I had a set of keys
[1:57:55] somebody got a key a set of keys up in
[1:57:59] here go ahead say it's rattling
[1:58:02] things rattling things anybody else got
[1:58:05] some keys in here come on remind the
[1:58:08] devil he ain't got the keys to his own
[1:58:14] house he don't have the keys to death he
[1:58:17] don't have the keys to hell he don't
[1:58:19] have the keys to the Grave so what is
[1:58:22] trying to lock you up in has all
[1:58:25] almighty God has already set himself
[1:58:28] loose let him
[1:58:32] go that's why Peter had such force on
[1:58:35] the day of Pentecost he stood up there
[1:58:37] and preached the 15 minutes seron and
[1:58:39] said repent every one of you and be
[1:58:42] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:58:44] the remissions of your sins and you
[1:58:46] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:58:49] William brandham said in question
[1:58:50] answers 195 four he said when Peter said
[1:58:54] that the keys that he received up there
[1:58:56] in Matthew chapter 16 that these Keys of
[1:58:59] the Kingdom I'll give you to bind on
[1:59:02] Earth I'll bind it in heaven and what
[1:59:04] you loose on Earth I'll loose in heaven
[1:59:07] he said on that day after the day of
[1:59:09] Pentecost he said the key stuck in
[1:59:11] heaven and it stayed
[1:59:13] [Applause]
[1:59:20] there you got the authority of the king
[1:59:23] that's why Peter had such power he could
[1:59:25] go to the book he could go through Acts
[1:59:27] chapter 3 lay his hand lay his hand on
[1:59:30] the one that was lame from ever since he
[1:59:32] was a mother's womb he had the power to
[1:59:35] heal sick and cast out demons in Acts
[1:59:37] chapter 5 you see judgment as Peter
[1:59:40] would stand there over ananas and Safara
[1:59:43] you see because Peter had the authority
[1:59:46] he had the keys to the kingdom you see
[1:59:48] him walking down there he goes down
[1:59:51] there to the man by the name of anas he
[1:59:54] was paralyzed and been in bed for eight
[1:59:56] years and when he heard about it when he
[1:59:59] heard about it Peter walked over in
[2:00:01] there and said unto ananas said Jesus
[2:00:04] Christ makes you whole get up out of
[2:00:06] your
[2:00:07] bed get up out of your I can't do this
[2:00:10] because Jesus already
[2:00:13] dead Peter had such a force behind him
[2:00:17] that he could walk over in there when a
[2:00:19] woman by the name of Dorcas also known
[2:00:21] as abatha when she's there in Acts
[2:00:23] chapter 9 and she was doing a good work
[2:00:25] and she was making coats and blankets
[2:00:27] for the kingdom of God and Etc when
[2:00:29] Peter heard about it and they heard that
[2:00:31] Peter was in the city Peter walked over
[2:00:33] there where he was where Dorcas was
[2:00:35] laying there dead and he looked on and
[2:00:38] said Tabitha
[2:00:39] arise why because the Keys of the
[2:00:42] Kingdom were in
[2:00:44] effect they knew they were in effect
[2:00:47] when Paul when Peter is up there in the
[2:00:49] common prison in Acts chap 12 and they
[2:00:52] begin to have prayer over in John Mark's
[2:00:54] house that they begin to authoritie
[2:00:56] authorize the power of them keys and he
[2:01:00] started praying and an angel let him
[2:01:04] out brother but to me one of the
[2:01:07] greatest Miracles that Peter does is
[2:01:10] when he's standing there in Acts chapter
[2:01:12] 8 and he starts hearing about Samaria
[2:01:14] how they heard and receive the word of
[2:01:16] the Lord and when he heard about it he
[2:01:19] went down there and laids hands on them
[2:01:21] right and when he laid their hands on
[2:01:23] them that they received the Holy Ghost
[2:01:25] right there you see there was going to
[2:01:27] be plenty more demons that needed to be
[2:01:29] cast out there was going to be plenty of
[2:01:31] people that set themselves in the
[2:01:32] streets so that Peter's power or his
[2:01:35] shadow would walk over top of them but
[2:01:37] the major difference was these Miracles
[2:01:41] these healings would come and they would
[2:01:42] go demons would resist and demons would
[2:01:45] resist again but what happened when they
[2:01:48] received the Holy Ghost was eternal amen
[2:01:54] thank you Lord it's no longer one man
[2:01:57] bride one man message it was the
[2:02:00] anointed man but now it's the anointed
[2:02:02] people by accepting what Eve turned
[2:02:06] down so the
[2:02:08] name of the king when you're buried in
[2:02:12] his name you carry all power and
[2:02:18] authority that the King has
[2:02:23] if I could say it like this is that the
[2:02:26] King has confidence in his seal am I'm
[2:02:30] I'm coming down real real quick
[2:02:33] like brother Joel would say it's a
[2:02:35] helicopter he's just going to land
[2:02:38] it but the King has got confidence in
[2:02:42] his
[2:02:43] seal because it can't be
[2:02:45] impersonated and he knows where it's
[2:02:48] at and he's placed some final runners in
[2:02:52] this
[2:02:52] age that they're going to run with a
[2:02:55] message and they've got the king scepter
[2:02:58] in their hand and didn't matter who
[2:03:00] stood in front of them it didn't matter
[2:03:02] who tried to stop him he had a message
[2:03:04] from the King and he was going to run
[2:03:06] with everything within him to carry that
[2:03:08] message you see when when they're
[2:03:11] they're running that that great Olympic
[2:03:12] run the marathon they're coming in
[2:03:16] there's a lot of people that are there
[2:03:17] in the beginning there's a lot of people
[2:03:19] that are standing around but when it
[2:03:20] gets about a quarter way through the
[2:03:24] crowd starts dropping off and the cheers
[2:03:27] aren't there and then you start running
[2:03:28] on your your own
[2:03:30] energy then you might see somebody
[2:03:32] standing there to encourage you and give
[2:03:33] you a drink of water as you begin to get
[2:03:35] in to the the the the halfway mark and a
[2:03:38] 3/4 Mark and then all of a sudden it
[2:03:41] goes completely silent and you're
[2:03:43] running on your own amen the people that
[2:03:46] were running with you at the beginning
[2:03:47] are not running there now they're
[2:03:50] starting to drop off yeah some of them
[2:03:52] had done went by the way of the
[2:03:54] grave but when you keep on pushing and
[2:03:58] it doesn't look like the miracle coming
[2:04:00] and it doesn't look like it's it's worth
[2:04:02] battling for you just keep running when
[2:04:05] nobody else is with you you're not
[2:04:07] looking around to see if they're there
[2:04:08] or not because you have a purpose and
[2:04:11] your purpose is to finish the race you
[2:04:14] see you you are destined to finish this
[2:04:16] race whether the other people choose to
[2:04:18] it choose to do it or not whether they
[2:04:21] give up of whether or stretch ass to
[2:04:23] take them off there's something
[2:04:25] different about you because you are
[2:04:27] under a king's message and he's anointed
[2:04:30] you to run the last mile of this race
[2:04:32] and not give up and not give in and if
[2:04:35] he saw that you were going to run this
[2:04:37] race he was going to give you the
[2:04:39] efforts he was going to give you the
[2:04:41] energies he was going to give you the
[2:04:43] power to finish
[2:04:45] it and you might get into a spot where
[2:04:48] you're all alone and there's nobody in
[2:04:52] else but they say it's when you enter
[2:04:56] the
[2:05:06] arena your loved
[2:05:08] one but you saw pass off the
[2:05:13] scene brother seon there he is there's
[2:05:17] brother Frasier there's Sister Sarah
[2:05:20] Thorton there's brother Johnny
[2:05:23] Morris and you got one more you got one
[2:05:26] more lap in the
[2:05:34] building and all of a sudden it's quiet
[2:05:36] on the
[2:05:37] outside and as you begin to enter into
[2:05:40] the arena you hear the Roar of a
[2:05:43] crowd you can finish this race we're not
[2:05:47] perfect without you run run run and then
[2:05:53] you start hear the Roar of the crowd
[2:05:55] they're behind you you don't have 0%
[2:05:58] left you gave your all you gave your
[2:06:01] best but they're chearing you on and
[2:06:04] you're running on fumes as it seems but
[2:06:07] then the king gives you a shout and you
[2:06:10] start getting another second wind and
[2:06:13] you run and you
[2:06:16] run and all of a sudden the gate swings
[2:06:20] wide and you're running
[2:06:22] [Applause]
[2:06:27] could I say it like this as a musicans
[2:06:29] come you're who we've been waiting for
[2:06:34] amen Moses said what it was like when he
[2:06:37] overcome in his age Paul said it was
[2:06:39] like What He overcame in his age William
[2:06:42] brandham stood in this generation but
[2:06:44] he's not going to stand there alone
[2:06:46] there's a body of Believers that have
[2:06:48] run with this king's message
[2:06:52] amen

[2:06:56] fall away but I know I'm going to keep
[2:07:02] running I don't know how many is going
[2:07:03] to go by the way of the grave but I'm
[2:07:05] going to keep on running I don't know
[2:07:07] how many is going to disbelieve but I'm
[2:07:09] going to keep on
