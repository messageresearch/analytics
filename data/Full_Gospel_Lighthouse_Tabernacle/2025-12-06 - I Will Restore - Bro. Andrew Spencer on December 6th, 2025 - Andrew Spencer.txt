I cried with fear as the [music] night [singing] began to fall. [music] One more lost [singing] lamb. But I heard my shephers [music and singing] call. He saw my [music and singing] steps as they walked. right into the dark. [music] Though I went astray, I never [music] once left his heart. that night long ago. How I [singing] still [music] recall when [music] I lost my way. But I heard the shephers call. [music] He left the phone to search out that one [music and singing] last stray. [music] He left 99 for there was one to be saved. [music and singing] There on that ledge, one step would have ended it all. But I felt the hand and I heard the shephers [music] call. [singing] He saw my steps [singing] as they walked [music] right into the door. Though I went astray, [music] I never [singing] once left his heart. [music] that night long ago. How I still [singing] recall [music] when I lost my way and I heard the [music] shephers call. He left the fold [music] to search [singing] out that one that's straight. He left [music] 99 for there was one to be saved. Hallelujah. And there on that ledge, [music] one step would have [singing] ended it all. [music] But I felt his hand. But I felt his hand. And I heard the [music] shephers [singing] call. Well, they [music] saw my steps as they walked right into the dark. Though I went [music] astray, I never once left his heart. [singing] [music] Oh, you see that night long ago, how I still [music] recall when I lost my [singing and music] way and I heard the shephers call. [music] He saw my steps [music and singing] as they walked right into the dark. I never once [music and singing] left his heart that [music and singing] night long ago. How I still [music and singing] recall when I [music] lost my way and I heard the shephers call. [singing] Oh, that night long ago, how I still recall when I lost [music] my way and I heard the shephers [singing] call. [applause] Aren't you glad you heard the shepherd's call? &gt;&gt; Amen. I've been held by the Savior. I [music] felt fire [singing] from above. I've been down to [music] the river. I ain't the same prodal return. [music] And all [singing] my hope is in Jesus. [music] Thank [singing] God my yesterday [music] is gone. And all [singing] my sins are forgiven. [music] Oh, I've been washed by the blood. I'm no stranger [music] to the prison. I've worn shackles and [music and singing] chains, but I've been freed and [singing] forgiven. [music] Yes, I have. I'm not going back. I'll never be the [music] same. That's why I sing. [singing] All my [music] hope is in Jesus. Thank [singing] God my yesterday is gone and all my [music] sins are forgiven. Oh, I've been [music and singing] washed by the blood.

Have you been washed by the blood tonight? &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Shannon, Brother Joel. Let's prepare to have Brother Andrew come out, bring the word to us tonight. If we all could stand. Precious love of God. Before I spoke a word, you were singing over me. [music] You have been so so good to me. Before I took a breath, you [music] breathed your life in me. [music] You [singing] have been so so kind [music] to me. Oh, [music and singing] the overwhelming neverending preious love of God. Oh, it chases me [music and singing] down, fights till I'm found, leaves the 99. [music and singing] I couldn't earn it. I don't [music] deserve it. Still you give yourself [music and singing] away. Oh, the overwhelming, [music] [singing] neverending, precious love of God. [music] When I was your foe, still your love [music] fought for me. He still fought for you, church.

Oh the overwhelming [music] [singing] neverending precious of God. We couldn't earn it and we didn't deserve it. But still, he gave himself [music] away. Oh, the [singing] overwhelming [music] neverending precious love [music] of God. There's no shadow you [music] won't light up. Mountain you won't climb up coming after me. [music] There's no [singing] wall you won't kick down. Lie you won't tear down. Coming [music] after me. Shadow [music] you won't light up. Mountain you won't climb up. Coming after me. Nothing can stop him. [music] Church. Oh you won't kick down. Lie you won't [music] tear down. calling after me. There's no shadow you won't light up, mountain you won't climb up. Coming after me. He's going to get you one way or the other. Nothing can stop him. You're coming after [music and singing] me. Oh, the overwhelming neverending precious [music] love [singing] of God. Oh, it chases [music] me down, fights till I found, leaves [music] the night. [music] You give [music] yourself away. Oh, [singing] the [music] overwhelming, neverending, preious love of God. Are you thankful for the love of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just go to the Lord [music] tonight. Father, we come to you, Lord. We approach your throne of mercy and grace just now, Lord. Father, [music] with our hearts humbled before the great I am. Lord, realizing Lord Jesus, you said in your word where two or three are gathered in my name. There I will be [music] in the midst of them. And Father, we recognize that we are not in this building alone, but the great spirit of Jehovah is here. [music] And Lord Jesus, we just invite you to our life just now to come and minister to us in a specific way. Father, we have been through many trials, through many dangers, and it was your grace and your mercy that was always there running after us. Father, we're so thankful that we could come one more time to the house of God so that you could speak to us, Lord, from thy living word. Now, Father, if we approach you in the right way, Lord, if we respect you in the right way, we believe, Lord Jesus, that you would minister to us, you will speak to us. Lord [music] Jesus, I pray that tonight as you would take us through the scriptures, Father, that you would remind us of how powerful that you are. Lord Jesus, in what you're doing, Father, it can never be stopped, Father. Satan might constantly try to avail and try to prevail against the church of the living God. But you have set a standard up, Lord. [music] And I pray, Father, that you would just push back every every demon power, oh God, that would try to stop your children, [music] every thought of unbelief and doubt and fear. Lord, I pray that tonight that you would come and you would just begin to take us [music] through the work. Father, we love you so much. We believe that you're able and capable of doing above our [music] expectations tonight. I believe that your intentions are great. And I pray, Father, that we would perfectly line up exactly with what you have on your mind, Father. Lord Jesus, [music] we realize that we're in a season of winter, Father. There's certain times and certain seasons. The Bible says there is a season for everything. But there never has been one time where you said in your word there was a season to give up and a season to quit. I pray that this moment, this hour, [music] that we would persevere like never before. move into the promises of God for the things that you have for us at this moment. We love you so much in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight, we'd like to look in the book of Genesis chapter 1. Genesis chapter 1 and verse 26 and then to Genesis 2 and verse 7. Didn't our brother Jordan do a wonderful job? Amen. I believe I was more nervous for him than he was. So, he just did a wonderful, wonderful job. We appreciate all of our song leaders and our worshippers. Amen. We've been blessed, haven't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'd like to just speak to you a little thought that's been on my heart and maybe we'll just carry it on throughout this Christmas season if the Lord would would so allow us. I'd like to speak to you on I will restore. Genesis 1 and 26. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth." So God created man in his own image. In the image of God created he him. Male and female created he them. And God blessed them. And God said unto them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." Genesis 2 and7. And the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden. And there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground, God out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food and every and the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Let's jump down to verse 16. And it says, "And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, of every tree of the garden, thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die. And the Lord God said, It is not good that man should be alone. I will make him a helpmate for him." also Joel chapter 2 and verse 25. I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm. My great army which I sent amongst you. May God bless his word. You may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord. Brother Brandham preaches a very powerful message on the end time evangelism. If you haven't listened to it for a while, I advise you to go do so in this hour. Brother Brandham said, now he said, look at here. He said, remember my message recently on the bride tree. See how that they took Jesus? He was a tree, the one that David saw, a tree planted by the rivers of water, his fruit in season, the most perfect tree. And they cut him down and hung him on a man-made Roman tree for a mockery. But what did he do? He rose up again on the third day. What else did he do? He set forth a bride, a tree, a bride tree, a man and a woman, like the trees that was in the Garden of Eden. Two trees. One of them the tree of life and one the tree of death. And what did he do? He come to redeem this tree. So since he redeemed it at Calvary, he's ready to plant her now. So since he redeemed it at Calvary, he's ready to plant her now. He said, "I get to feeling religious when you say that." He said, "To restore his bride tree, the one that should have been in Eden." To think about this tree, this bride that should have been back there in Eden. He said to restore this tree that should have been all the way back there in Eden, but she fell because she disbelieved the word. But here, let's say together, but here he's going to restore a tree that will believe the word. And we realize that this message has came across our paths for just that reason. Is that God wanted to restore a tree, a people, a person that would completely believe the word. Brother Brandon would teach us that the bridegroom tree without the female tree could never could never and will never produce a fruit or will never bear fruit. So it takes a bridegroom and a bride to be able to bring forth the life or the the fruit that was there. Jesus would say in John chapter 15 and5 that I am the vine and you are the branches. It's the branches that bear the fruit. But we realize that it's the life of God that goes throughout the branches that allows the individual or the person or the church to be able to bear that fruit. And Jesus said that without me, you can do absolutely nothing. So you realize that both of the vine and the branches, they are born of the very same material. The both bride and bridegroom in every single aspect of life, they are made of the same exact material. When you look and when God created man and a woman in the beginning, they were in a spirit realm. They were in a spirit form because God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. We realize that then God made man out of the dust of the earth. Notice when he brought forth woman, what did he do? He didn't create a different person. He simply took that which was on the inside of his original creation and brought forth that original creation. And therefore, Adam called her woman because she was bone of his bone and she was flesh of his flesh. We realize that every single one of us here that none of us are sitting here like the Lord Jesus, but we were all born in sin and we were shapened into iniquity. And we realize that our Lord Jesus Christ was the only one that ever bore in his own life A COMPLETE AND PERFECT BODY THAT NEVER HAD NO sin in it that never had disbelief in it. He was perfect in every single way. We realize this that Jesus if he would not have took upon him the form of man and died upon a cross that Jesus would still be living even right now today. Because Jesus was eternal, but you and I were made of flesh just like our Lord was made, but we come maybe through we come a different way. We were not VIRGIN BORN, BUT WE REALIZE that in our own flesh, we bear the mark of disbelief. We bear the mark OF A FLAW THAT HAPPENED TWO OR 6,000 years ago, many, many years ago there in the Garden of Eden. When you were born here, you didn't have nothing to do with that sin. But yet you was born in that same in that same shape. You were born here. YOU NEVER WERE TAUGHT TO THINK THE WRONG THINGS. YOU WERE NEVER TAUGHT TO SAY THE wrong things. But you were born under a fall of humanity. YOU DIDN'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU HAD COMING BY YOUR WAY BECAUSE ADAM AND EVE SOLD US OUT AS HUMANITY. BUT THIS MESSAGE THAT HAS COME TO US IS A MESSAGE OF RESTORATION, A MESSAGE OF JUSTIFICATION. SANCTIFICATION AND THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, THE MESSAGE HAS COME TO RESTORE A FALLEN BRIDE BACK TO HER RIGHTFUL POSITION TO PUT HER EXACTLY WHERE OUR LORD JESUS SAW US BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world. AND WHEN YOU look at this message, IT IS A MESSAGE OF RESTORATION THAT IS CENTERED AROUND THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. THIS MESSAGE CAME TO EXPRESS WHO YOU TRULY WERE. AND GOD HAD SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF HIS MIND. AND HE REVEALED IT IN A PORTION OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. NOTICE THIS MESSAGE TAKES US BACK TO A PLACE OF PURITY, BACK TO A PLACE BEFORE THE FALL. YOU DON'T REALIZE WHAT THIS MESSAGE HAS DONE TO YOU. SOME PEOPLE THINK OF IT AS TAPES. SOME PEOPLE THINK OF IT AS ANOTHER CHURCH. BUT THIS MESSAGE HAS RESTORED A CHURCH SPIRITUALLY BACK TO A PLACE OF EDEN FELLOWSHIP WHERE THE MASTER CAN COME DOWN IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING AND HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH HIS BRIDE JUST LIKE HE WOULD DO WITH ADAM AND EVE WHEN THEY WOULD BE STANDING THERE IN A PERFECT EDEN. WHEN THERE WAS NO TROUBLE THERE, WHEN THERE WAS NO CHAOS THERE, WHEN THERE WAS NO STRUGGLES AND NO CANCER AND NO SICKNESS AND NO DIABETES AND NO STOMACH BUGS AND NO HEADACHES AND NO HOSPITALS AND NO LAWYERS AND NO DOCTORS, &gt;&gt; THERE THEY WERE WALKING IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH THE MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE. AND I LOVE I LOVE HOW THE PROPHET I THANK GOD FOR THIS MESSAGE, BUT I LOVE HOW THE PROPHETS WOULD TEACH US HOW THAT HE WOULD SIT THERE AND HE WOULD WATCH ADAM AND EVE WALKING IN THE GARDEN. HE COULD SEE THEM COMING OUT. EVE WITH HER BLONDE HAIR AS IT SHE WOULD LAY HER HEAD OVER THERE ON ADAM'S DARK SHOULDER, HIS DARK HAIR AND HIS SHOULDER. SHE WOULD LAY HER HEAD OVER THERE AND SAID ALL OF A TIME ALL OF A SUDDEN AT THE COOL of the EVENING THERE THE MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE WOULD COME DOWN THROUGH THE GARDEN OF EDEN A PLACE WHERE SEEDS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SOWN AT WAS IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN AND THE PROPHET WOULD SAY MY CHILDREN AND THEY would say YES FATHER THEY WOULD SAY HE SAID HAVE YOU ENJOYED YOURSELF IN MY CREATION TODAY IS ALL WELL. AND THEY WOULD ANSWER BACK, "ALL IS WELL. HAVE YOU ENJOYED THE BLESSINGS THAT I CREATED FOR YOU?" AND THEY WOULD REPLY BACK, "YES, WE HAVE. WE'VE ENJOYED WHAT YOU CREATED FOR US." I'D SAY IN THIS EVENING TIME THAT THERE IS A WOMAN THAT CAN ANSWER BACK AND SAID, "YES, WE ARE ENJOYING THE BLESSINGS THAT YOU HAVE POURED OUT UPON US." WE ARE IN A FELLOWSHIP WHERE THE MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY IF YOU'RE GOING TO FALL OR NOT BECAUSE HE SAID, "I WILL RESTORE." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You can imagine the mindset of the Almighty. THIS DID NOT SURPRISE HIM, but you can imagine the hurt. He knows all things. He sees all things. He understands what's going to take place and he sees them as they're getting ready to make the worst decision ever made. Ever made. You think you've made bad decisions. You think you've made some big mistakes. Can you imagine living under this one mistake the rest of your life? You're the reason why there's every hospital. You're the reason why there's every little child that is born is still born. You're the reason why there is paralytics. You're the REASON WHY THAT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE MEDICINES AND DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE OF your one decision. Can you IMAGINE LIVING UNDER THAT SHADOW ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE? BUT THANK GOD EVE DIDN'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER THAT. SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER THAT. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER YOUR MISTAKES. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER THE FAULTS AND FAILURES OF YOUR OWN HUMANITY. HALLELUJAH. Adam was in a perfect paradise, a perfect place. You imagine as a master has longed for all those years to come back to a place where he could fellowship in the cool of the evening time. You see, when you look at the reality of our natural birth, every one of us were entered into this world through a natural birth because of Eve's fall. And every one of us, Jesus would say in John 3:6 that w that which is born of the flesh is flesh. David would say in Psalms 51 THAT I WAS SHAPING IN INIQUITY and in sinned my mother conceive me because of the fall in the evening in the Eden there. Every single life was born here was born in WEAKNESS WAS BORN BY A FALLEN NATURE AND EVERY PERSON has limitations because of the fault. I'D SAY THAT NONE of you had to teach your children how to break things. I'D SAY NONE OF YOU HAD TO TEACH YOUR CHILDREN HOW TO TELL A LIE AND GET INTO THE COOKIE JAR. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE BORN WITH. THERE WAS A MARK ON THEIR LIFE THAT THEY COULD NOT HELP. HALLELUJAH. But I WANT YOU TO KNOW THIS THAT THE ELECT OF GOD, THEY CARRY SOMETHING BEYOND THE NATURAL BIRTH. YOU SEE, YOU ARE NOT DEFINED. LET ME SAY AS THE ELECT OF GOD, YOU ARE NOT DEFINED BY YOUR NATURAL BIRTH. YOU ARE DEFINED BY THE GENE SEED OF GOD. BECAUSE JESUS DIDN'T STOP THERE IN JOHN 3 AND6 WHEN HE SAID THAT WHICH IS BORN OF THE FLESH IS FLESH. BUT HE SAID THAT WHICH [screaming] IS BORN OF THE SPIRIT IS SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS THE SPIRIT THAT BEARETH WITNESS WITH OURSELF THAT WE ARE THE CHILDREN OF GOD. YOU SEE, I refuse TO BE GOVERNED BY MY NATURAL BIRTH. I refuse TO BE GOVERNED BY MY TEMPER. I REFUSE TO BE GOVERNED BY THE OLD MAN BECAUSE GOD, [screaming] A DIVINE DEPOSIT, PUT SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF THE ELECT OF GOD. Let me say THIS TO YOU. THE HOLY GHOST IS NOT A LEARNED BEHAVIOR. THE HOLY GHOST IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU TEACH. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS INHERITED BECAUSE YOU WERE BORN IN THE RIGHT FAMILY. It is an experience. The prophet said, he said, "The doormat's laid out the welcome mat tonight. God's plan of redemption through the offering up of the blood of the Lord Jesus once and for all to cleanse the guilty unworthy sinner to bring him into reconciliation with God and restore him back into the Garden of Eden again in fellowship. He said now Jesus come to restore the human race everything that he lost in Eden and we're on our road. We have the earnest of that deliverance. And what was the Holy Ghost given for? The prophet said, "And then he was made flesh and dwelt amongst us in order THAT HE COULD COME BACK AGAIN TO man and live in MAN AND RESTORE MAN." HALLELUJAH. TO A STATE OF COMMUNION WITH HIM AGAIN AND GIVE HIM BACK HIS GOD-GIVEN RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT HE DID. THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE HOLY GHOST. IT'S THE FATHER AGAIN. GOD THE FATHER dwelling in you, WORKING OUT HIS PLANS TO FINISH, HIS PLANS OF REDEMPTION, working for you, MAKING YOU A CO-ORKER, &gt;&gt; A CO-WORKER WITH HIM. SOMEBODY OUGHT TO SHOUT, "AMEN." GIVING YOU A PLACE, GIVING YOU A PART FOR YOUR FALLEN, lost brother and sister, giving you his spirit and his love TO GO HUNT THE LOST as he did in the Garden OF EDEN. ADAM, ADAM, WHERE ART THOU? THAT'S WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT DOES TO A MAN OR A WOMAN WHEN IT STRIKES INTO THEIR HEART AND TAKES ITS ABODE. THERE'S A THIRST AND A HUNGERING FOR LOST SOULS. JUST LIKE THE FATHER WAS LOOKING FOR THE LOST ADAM, THAT SAME SPIRIT ON THE INSIDE OF THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD IS TO DO THE SAME THING. WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE ARE YOU? THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE CAME TO DO. IT'S TO BRING YOU BACK. &gt;&gt; You see, when God created the earth, he created the earth for this one purpose. a place that you could habitat, that it would BE A PLACE FOR HIS FAMILY, THAT THAT WOULD BE THEIR HABITATION. HIS PLAN from the very beginning WAS THAT GOD WOULD HAVE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF God in his own image, &gt;&gt; made like him, to think like him, TO SPEAK LIKE HIM, TO ACT LIKE HIM. AND LUCIFER GOT IN THE DETAILS OF IT. I'D HEARD the prophet say it like this is that when he was creating Lucifer was sitting there and said, "I can do that. I can do that. I can do that." You see, he had longed for that position as he was watching God in heaven. And then when God's son, his created son, comes here ON EARTH AND HE STARTS SPEAKING THINGS into existence, Lucifer said, "I can do that, too. I can do that, too." BUT LET ME SAY THIS TO YOU. THERE IS NO POWER THAT HELL HAS. THEY CAN HAVE ALL THE POWERS OF HELL. THEY'VE GOT ALL THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF HELL, BUT HELL DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE ONE MOLECULE, TO CREATE ONE SALE, TO CREATE ONE BAD THING OR ONE GOOD THING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; STOP LETTING HELL WIN IN YOUR LIFE. HELL DOES NOT CREATE. &gt;&gt; I hear people say, "YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THE MESS THAT HELL CREATED FOR ME TODAY." ABSOLUTELY CONTRARY. THAT'S THE MOST FALSE THING THAT YOU CAN SAY. HELL HAS NOT CREATED ONE THING. IF YOU'VE GOT HELL ON YOUR JOB, SOMEBODY CREATED THAT. NOT THE DEVIL, NOT HIS IMPS, NOT HIS DEMONS. &gt;&gt; But what Satan does is get involved in the creation and begins to make it fall. You see, ever since the beginning, Lucifer has fought the very plan of God, but he's never altered it. &gt;&gt; HE'S FOUGHT AGAINST IT. HE'S ATTACKED IT. EVERY SCHEME, EVERY ATTACK HAS NEVER OVERTURNED THE VERY MIND OF GOD. SO, SATAN MAY OPPOSE YOU, BUT HE'LL NOT OVERCOME YOU. SATAN MAY ATTACK YOU, BUT HE WILL NOT DEFEAT YOU. YOU SEE, WHEN YOU WATCH AS JOB TAKES THESE BINOCULARS AND HE starts looking out 2,000 years, 2500 years before you ever got here, Joel takes the binoculars of God's word and he would look out there and say, "There's modern events going to be made clear by prophecy [gasps] and there's going to be somebody step into it. THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY THAT FULFILLS THE EVENT. I want you to know THAT WHEN JOE IS WATCHING THIS, he's watching THIS GREAT PANORAMIC AS IT'S TAKING place and these four bugs come in there, the caterpillar, the palmer worm, the cankerorm. As they come in THERE AND THEY START EATING AWAY AT THE VERY TREE, WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS THE SAME BUG THAT KILLED the original tree. IS THE SAME BUG THAT IS TRYING TO KILL THE BRIDE TREE. &gt;&gt; WHAT DID HE DO? HE ATE IT ALL THE WAY DOWN. THAT ANTICHRIST SPIRIT, WHAT did he do? That Roman Catholic Antichrist spirit begin to eat the very life out of the bride tree. And you watch as the caterpillar went to work and the commer and the palmer worm AND THE CANKER WORM AS THEY ALL WENT TO WORK. THEY ATE OUT BROTHERHOOD. THEY OUT THEY ATE OUT THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT and it ate it all the way down to the roots. But brother BRANDHAM SAID THAT THIS CHURCH WAS PREDESTINATED FROM THE ROOTS AND SATAN HAS NEVER STOPPED IT BECAUSE GOD ORDAINED IT. &gt;&gt; ORDAINED IT FROM ITS ROOTS. HE WILL NEVER STOP THE ROOT OF THIS PROBLEM. HE WILL NEVER STOP THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. HALLELUJAH. THE SAME POWER THAT WAS IN Jesus is supposed to BE IN THE BRIDE TREE. THE SAME ATTRIBUTES. So if they cut down that tree, then they will try again to cut down this tree. But God said, "I will restore." I love what the prophet said. This is one of my favorite quotes ever in the seven compound names of Jehovah. He said, in other words, he said, it is what Jehovah is. It's made up in them seven redemptive names. His attitude towards the people from Eden BACK TO EDEN IS WRAPPED up in them seven redemptive names. And you ever wonder what is God's attitude towards my situation? Well, if we want to find anything out about God, then we've got to look at his name. If we want to I'll be honest, there's some times in my life where I really get to a spot. I wonder how God's attitude is with me. And I go to remembering what this quote says. But his attitude towards his PEOPLE FROM EDEN AND BACK TO EDEN IS WRAPPED up in them seven redemptive names. Jehovah Gyra, the Lord will provide. Jehovah Rafa, THE LORD OUR HEALER. JEHOVAH NI, THE LORD OUR BANNER. Jehovah Shalom, the Lord OUR PEACE. JEHOVAH RAHA, THE LORD OUR SHEPHERD. Jehovah Tisanu, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. JEHOVAH SHAMA [screaming] THE LORD IS PRESENT. THAT IS GOD'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS YOU. &gt;&gt; SO HE IS HIS ATTITUDE IS I WILL PROVIDE. I WILL SEE YOUR NEED BEFORE YOU SEE IT AND I WILL PROVIDE. I WILL THE I AM THE LORD THAT HEALS YOU OF ALL OF THY DISEASES. I AM NOT THE AUTHOR OF SICKNESS BUT I AM THE AUTHOR OF YOUR HEALING. I AM [screaming] THE LORD, YOUR BANNER. I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE MINE. &gt;&gt; I am Jehovah Shalom. I am your peace. I don't want you to be afraid. I don't want you to be in torment. I don't want you to be fearful because I give you myself. LEOA IS FULL of fear. BUT I'M REMINDED THIS IS HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS ME. HE IS Jehovah Shalom. TELL THE DEVIL NEXT TIME FEAR ROLLS ON TOP OF YOU. REMIND THAT DEVIL THAT I HAVE AN ATTITUDE FROM THE ALMIGHTY. Come on, somebody. You know good and well the devil gets an attitude WITH YOU AND TRIES TO ROLL YOU BACK when you've HAD A GOOD DAY ON FRIDAY AND HE TRIES TO ROLL YOU BACK TO MONDAY. WHY DON'T YOU tell that devil God's got an attitude? &gt;&gt; MY GOD'S GOT AN ATTITUDE, SISTER GABRIELLE. AND IT'S AN ATTITUDE OF PEACE. IT'S AN ATTITUDE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. [screaming] I AM JEHOVAH TISKANU, THE LORD THY RIGHTEOUSNESS. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? YOU CAN NEVER MAKE YOURSELF RIGHTEOUS. BUT HE SAID, I AM [screaming] YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. I am Jehovah Shama. I am always there. That's my attitude towards you. In the valley, I'm with you. In the mountains, I'M WITH YOU. IN THE GOOD TIMES, I'M WITH YOU. AND I SAID IN MY WORD THAT I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AND I WILL NEVER FORSAKE YOU. I AM JEHOVAH RAH. I AM THE LORD THY SHEPHERD. I WILL LEAD YOU. I WILL GUIDE YOU. I WILL COMFORT YOU. AND I WILL FEED YOU. I will restore. It's amazing how much Leosa wants to take away from the church of the living God. This spirit of this evil age wants to put it on the church of the living God to make them think that they are alone. To make them feel like the message is dead and the message has no power. But Satan has showed up too late. &gt;&gt; This ain't just the God of William Brown. This ain't just the God of the days gone by. People try to say that the days of miracles are passed. I refuse to believe that BECAUSE JEHOVAH HAS NEVER CHANGED AND JEHOVAH never will. People change, IDEAS CHANGE, BUT GOD NEVER CHANGES. You see, when God created man in the very beginning, he had a mindset about them, what they would be, how they would act, every little thing. Brother Brandon would show us that in every generation there is twins of every revival. There's church spiritual, there's church carnal. You can look all the way back there in the Garden of Eden and you see those two trees. You see the tree of life and the tree of knowledge and good of evil. You see Cain and Abel. You see Esau and Jacob. And you watch as Jacob as he comes to his identity from the natural birth. He comes from his natural birth and he's there and he has the abilities to tell some of the greatest stories. You ever met somebody like that? They've all I tell you what, I I met this guy one time. Went to church. Some of the best liars go to church. &gt;&gt; I'm not kidding. This guy would tell you anything in the world to tell you everything except for the truth. He would lie his way out of telling you the truth. He would tell people he he played with Michael Vic. He was on Frank Beamer's squad. Some of the dumbest stuff. The guy never looked like a football player. It's amazing just to see if somebody would believe it. But here, Jacob is the greatest deceiver. And I love this is because it seems like church people have a way of sometimes being deceptive. &gt;&gt; I'm just preaching. I'm not got I ain't got nobody in target. I promise you that. I'm just preaching from a quote. But you look, he's a deceiver. He's a shyster. He tells some OF THE GREATEST LIES. HE HAS THE ABILITY to pull tricks on people and he knows how to make money with it. He's good. He's a businessman. But notice, HE GETS TO A SPOT WHERE HE CAN'T HANDLE IT no more on his own. HE IS FIGHTING AGAINST his own flesh. But yet ON THE INSIDE OF JACOB, HE REALIZES THERE'S SOMETHING POWERFUL ABOUT HIM. He hates WHO HE IS. HE DESPISES THE WAY HE IS. HE HATES THE WAY HE TREATS PEOPLE. BUT YET, THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF HIM. WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG LITTLE BOY, WHEN HIS BROTHER DESPISED THE BIRTHIGHT, EVEN THOUGH JACOB WAS A GREAT LIAR, THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE BIRTHRIGHT THAT JACOB WANTED. &gt;&gt; You ever GOT TO A SPOT WHEN YOU HATED who you were? You couldn't get along with nobody. You couldn't get along with the boss, and you're the boss. You hated who YOU WAS. YOU DESPISED IT. YOU HATED IT. And you got to a SPOT WHERE YOU GOT TO GET A CHANGE. But don't worry, we all been there. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. Until you hate who you are, you will never have a change. &gt;&gt; People say, "I get tired of going back to dirty websites." Until you hate that thing, &gt;&gt; you'll keep going back to that thing. I hate how I act. I hate how I TREAT PEOPLE. I HATE HOW I SPEAK TO PEOPLE. YOU WILL ONLY GET A CHANGE WHEN YOU HATE THAT THING. AND JACOB GOT TO THAT SPOT WHERE HE WAS AFRAID OF HIS BROTHER. HE WAS AFRAID OF THE MAN THAT SHOULD HAVE LOVED HIM. &gt;&gt; But when Jacob got to a spot, this is where you got to get is when you wrestle it out with the Almighty. Can I keep this? No. Can I have that? No. God, I I just want to hold on TO THAT. NO. AND FINALLY WHEN HE STARTED WRESTLING IT OUT, HE SAID, "I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU GO UNTIL YOU BLESS ME." AND WHEN HE WRESTLED IT OUT WITH THE ALMIGHTY, WHAT DID JACOB DO? IT RESTORED HIS TRUE IDENTITY THAT WAS ON THE INSIDE OF HIM BEFORE THE FALL. &gt;&gt; That was who he was supposed to be. &gt;&gt; He was supposed TO BE ISRAEL FROM THE FIRST PLACE. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ISRAEL FROM THE FIRST PLACE. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THE BRIDE, NOT THE CHURCH FROM THE FIRST PLACE. BUT BECAUSE OF SATAN'S DIRTY TRICKS, that's why the prophet, there's been a lot of people confuse it and look out there, but a prophet could stand right there in the invisible union. Only a prophet could do this because you know good and well if you had this power, you'd run with it. You know good and well you would have. You'd have run with this. You'd have made everything right. You'd have made everything you done right. But a prophet looked over your life and said, "You're justified as if you never done it in the first place." I want to REMIND THE DEVIL, I AM NOT THE ONE THAT SAID IT. YOU ARE NOT THE ONE THAT SAID IT. THE PROPHET OF THE LORD WAS INSTRUCTED BY THE MIGHTY ANGEL TO SAY TO THEM, "DON'T DO IT NO MORE. YOU'RE JUSTIFIED AS IF." &gt;&gt; Do you know what that spot is? As if. It's going back to the days of your virgin. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's one spot where brother Brandon would talk about a woman, a woman of ill fame, where he says, "The blood of Jesus Christ can take you back to the days of your innocency." Hallelujah. Can you imagine the Almighty? I'm trying not to get ahead of myself cuz I feel like preaching right now. Can you imagine the Almighty? He sees you coming to this. You see it when you're riding down a road and you know the curve's right ahead and you wonder how am I going to take that curve? Is there anybody going to be in that curve? Could be somebody on my side. Could be somebody around there ready to hit me. Let me say this. The Almighty is already on the other side of your curve. &gt;&gt; He knows what's coming and he knows how to get him out of the way. Let me say this to you. You know good and well that he's had people in your life that he had simply had to just move them off to the side because they were getting ready to block you. I feel like preaching, RIGHT? HE HAD PEOPLE THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE GOING to be A GOOD CHRISTIAN, GOOD TO BE A GOOD PERSON IN THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, BUT GOD SAID, "NO, they're going to hinder my bride around the curve." So, he has them JUST PULL OFF ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD SO THEY WON'T HINDER YOU. GOD KNOWS HOW TO PUT PEOPLE IN PLACE AND TAKE THEM OUT OF PLACE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LET ME SAY THIS. JOB OR JACOB'S CHARACTER WAS WHAT GOD RESTORED HIM BACK TO. THAT'S WHAT GOD HAD IN HIS ORIGINAL CREATION. That was his intention. &gt;&gt; There's a sermon laying right there. Heaven's intentions. Let me say this. The prophet said, "And I will restore, sayeth the Lord." He said, "Here's some time ago," he said, "I got a lesson on it." God restoring his people. He said he'd restore all the former days. And he's doing it right now. And the people don't realize it. God is doing this thing. and the people don't realize it. Now, that's in 1954. He said, "God is doing this thing right now, and the people don't realize it." When Mary starts testifying THAT THERE'S A CHILD ON THE INSIDE OF ME, I HAD A CONFERENCE WITH AN angel of the Lord, AND HE'S TOLD ME THAT I'M GOING TO BRING FORTH THE SON, AND I'M GOING TO CALL HIS NAME JESUS, AND HE'S GOING TO SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM HIS SINS. WHAT WAS IT? GOD WAS GETTING READY TO RESTORE CHRISTMAS BACK TO ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE, BUT people didn't realize it. What was it? It was hid in the veil of a woman. And there he is again, hid in the veil of a bride tree. You see, every one of those bugs, all of them had the same spirit, same anointing, and eat it all the way down to the stump. But God said, "Brother Haron, I will restore." [panting and gasps] Notice what the prophet said in the end time evangelism. He said, "Endime evangelism will be the mark of Malachi 4 to restore the faith of the people back to the faith of the fathers." Yes, sir. back to the building stones. YOU SEE, THAT'S WHAT MALACHI 4 WAS to do. Was to turn the hearts. You talk about a turning point. You say, "THIS MESSAGE WAS THE FIRST TURNING POINT, BUT PEOPLE REJECTED IT." &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE CAME TO RESTORE &gt;&gt; THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE DELIVERED TO THE SAINTS. THAT'S WHY JUDE IS STANDING RIGHT THERE AND HE'S CONTENDING WITH ALL OF HELL. AND HE SAID, "SAINTS, THIS IS WHAT WAS DELIVERED TO YOU. THE SAME SEED, THE SAME FAITH. &gt;&gt; It's worth contending for. You know good and well that a garden is a place that you cast seeds at." And this is where he planted his seeds at. I'd say if you could look at it in that realm, mothers and fathers, you understand what I'm doing here. He places his seat in this place. Brother Brandham said the only way that it'll never, he said, the only way that it'll stay dead is if it stays in the wrong place. So, you've got to put the seed in the right place. You see, when Tamar was coming to her position, she was coming under her anointing. There was somebody that had the ability to place seed at the right spot, but they refused to put the seed in a place where it could live. SO, SOMEBODY HAD TO GET THEMSEL IN POSITION. THERE WAS SOMEBODY WHERE THE MESSAGE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT WAS COMING BY YOUR WAY, BUT YOU GOT YOURSELF IN POSITION. SO THE SEED OF THE WORD COULD BE SOWN IN YOUR HEART BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF TAMAR THAT I'VE GOT TO GET THAT SEED. THAT SEED'S GOT TO BE PLANTED. Restore the faith back to the children. That's what this Malachi 4 anointing was to do. Was to restore, to return, to bring about. You see, this faith that was all the way back there in the Garden of Eden is the same kind of faith that this bride has right now. What was William Brandham operating with when he's sitting there at a little table and he's sitting there and he's telling this magnificent story? He said, "All I can say that he is still Jehovah Gyra." THAT'S HIS ATTITUDE. AND HE CREATE, HE TOLD how he created these squirrels, how he done it two times just now. And there said a little bitty woman over there at that TABLE AND SAID, "HOW CAN THESE THINGS BE?" &gt;&gt; SHE WASN'T QUESTIONING THE MESSAGE. SHE WAS QUESTIONING, "HOW CAN I do that?" That's what this message HAS DONE TO YOU. IT'S NOT MADE YOU WONDER HOW DID HE DO THAT? YOU SIT THERE AND SAY, "HOW CAN I DO THAT? HOW CAN I SPEAK TO MY SONS? HOW CAN I SPEAK TO MY DAUGHTERS? HOW CAN I SPEAK TO MY LOST LOVED ONES? I DON'T NEED SQUIRRELS, BUT I NEED A RAPTURE. I NEED CANCER TO LEAVE. I NEED TUMORS TO LEAVE. I NEED PRODALS TO COME BACK HOME. I WILL RESTORE THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE DELIVERED TO THE SAINTS OF THE LIVING GOD." WHAT happened when Ananas was over there and Saul HAD BEEN BLINDED BY the pillar of fire on the ROAD TO DAMASCUS AND THE BIBLE SAID ANANAS WENT OVER there and laid HIS HANDS ON SAUL AND SAID, "BROTHER SAUL, THE LORD HEALTH THEE AND TOOK HIM OUT THAT VERY HOUR AND BAPTIZED HIM." IT WAS THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE DELIVERED TO THE SAINTS. My Jesus, [sighs] brother, that's a faith that was once delivered to the saints. To believe God, his word, regardless of what circumstances, that has nothing to do with it. You know what God's attitude is? What about your attitude? &gt;&gt; You remember what them doctors told brother Brandham said when they come in there said when a patient has come in here and they've got a diagnosis that they're going to die with that cancer, he said if they take the right mental attitude, he said it'll actually that cancer case. It'll stop it right there in its track. WHERE DID YOU GET THAT KIND OF A FAITH AT? Where did you get that kind of an attitude at? THE BIBLE SAID IN Mark 11:22, "AND JESUS ANSWERING SAYING TO THEM, HAVE FAITH IN GOD." BROTHER MAN SAID, "WE BECOME A part of God because we're born of him. And the spirit of God that dwells in us is immortal. It has no beginning. It'll have no end." And that operating in a man gives him faith in his maker. the same maker that stood on the earth one day and said to that tree no man eateth from thee. He went on to say in verse 23, Jesus saying, "Verily, I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into THE SEA, AND SHALL NOT DOUBT in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith." I want you to read that out loud. For verily I say unto you, THAT WHOSOEVER SHALL SAY UNTO THIS MOUNTAIN, BE THOU REMOVED, AND be thou CAST INTO THE SEA, AND SHALL NOT DOUBT IN HIS HEART, BUT SHALL BELIEVE THAT THOSE THINGS WHICH HE SAITH SHALL COME to pass. HE SHALL HAVE WHATSOEVER HE SAITH. [applause] &gt;&gt; That's the faith that was once delivered to the saints. Therefore, I love when Jesus has a continuation. Therefore, it always scared me when I was in them business meetings and they said therefore. Sometimes on the other side of that therefore, there's some scary things. You ever been in a business meeting with Ron Spencer and you hear him say therefore, I'm glad I'm on his side. [panting] I've been on the other side of that table before the people that work for me and I was scared to death for them. I was shaking in their boots and I wasn't even the one in that trial. A lot of them got fired. Thank God I'm still here. Therefore, therefore, on the other side of it, THEREFORE I SAY UNTO YOU, GOD SAYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS business deal, whatsoever thingsoever, YOU DESIRE WHEN YOU PRAY, BELIEVE THAT YOU SHALL RECEIVE THEM, AND YOU SHALL HAVE THEM. &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "IT AIN'T MY BUSINESS DEAL THAT'S BEING DONE. IT'S YOURS. You want a million dollars, SPEAK IT INTO EXISTENCE. YOU WANT A CATTLE ON A THOUSAND HILLS, THAT'S NOTHING FOR MIGHTY GOD. YOU NEED BLESSING IN YOUR PLUMBING BUSINESS, THAT'S NOTHING FOR THE MIND OF GOD. YOU NEED BLESSING IN YOUR HEATING AND YOUR AIR CONDITIONING BUSINESS, THAT'S NOTHING FOR THE MIND OF GOD. YOU NEED A REGENERATION, THAT IS NOTHING FOR THE MIND OF GOD. YOU NEED A NEW BIRTH, THAT IS NOTHING FOR THE MIND OF GOD. YOU NEED A BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, THAT IS NOTHING FOR THE MIND OF GOD. YOU NEED TO BE RESTORED. &gt;&gt; What things? When brother Ron put me in business, I was 17 years old and I'll be honest, it was scary. I watched my father allowed me to make some thousand mistakes and even make a $100,000 mistakes. and he knew I was doing it. But he saw something on the inside of me that I didn't even see myself at sometimes. You see, I'm going to preach to me just for a minute about me just for a minute. He saw something on the inside of me that I didn't see on the inside of myself. He knew that I wouldn't give up when I made that thousand mistake. And I pressed through the thousand mistake. And when I got to a spot and I lost $56,000 in one night, I didn't give up then either. When I lost every single thing that I had to my name except for $300, I didn't give up then either. He realized something on the inside of me that I had. No give up on the inside of me that I was born to be resilient. But let me say this to you. I don't keep it there in business realm. There were times when I was preaching and it seemed like it didn't get over the banister right here and it seemed like it didn't touch nobody. But he didn't give up on me then. And he said, "Keep on preaching it. You just keep preaching it. You just KEEP PUTTING WHAT GOD SAID IN FRONT OF IT AND SAY AMEN BEHIND IT. THEN GOD'S OBLIGATED TO DO IT." SO I GOT BACK UP THERE AND I SAID THE SAME THINGS AGAIN. Was Brother Andrew, YOU READ THAT QUOTE LAST WEEKEND. YOU SAID THE SAME THING TWO WEEKS AGO. I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. YOU SEE, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I CAN SAY IT. I KNOW THAT I CAN READ IT. BUT WHEN THE HOLY GHOST GETS BEHIND AN AMEN OF IT, THEN IT'LL MANIFEST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT. SURE, I MADE SOME COSTLY MISTAKES IN BUSINESS, BUT THE HOLY GHOST HAS NEVER MADE A MISTAKE WHEN IT COMES TO THE WORD OF GOD. HE IS ALWAYS ON TIME. HE IS ALWAYS RIGHT IN THE SPOT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I sat down with a millionaire one time, probably a billionaire now. Me and him's got about the same story. His daddy just had more money than my daddy had. He said, "My daddy one time let me go out to China and make a $2 million mistake." He said, "But he knew that I would experience something great from it. and he knew that I'll recover it all. I sat down with him and I thought there's a principle behind this. There's a principle laying there and I sometimes I get to mission and things and I sometimes I'm just sometimes I'm just a hick and takes me a little bit. The world today doesn't have to go through the things that I had to go through. They got chat GBT. Let me tell you something. These people are getting infatuated with this chat GBT. It scares the fire out of me sometimes. It's good for a quick knowledge, but you better ask that thing. You better ask that thing if it's fabricating something or not. I had that thing tell me one. I'm not going in chat GBT. God forbid. It's good. It's good for what it is. I did tell that thing. You ever fabricate anything about William Brandham ever again, I'll never use you. Yes, sir. I understand that loud and clear. Well, let me say that to you. You ever fabricate anything about William Brandon? I'll never use you. You ever fabricate anything about God's word? [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; You see, you had to come through every lie of deception. You had to come through everything. You imagine this little bride, how that she has come through every every toil, through every little wave. Brother Brandham said that this little bride, he said, "She'll crest every wave." You think about every wave of every doctrine of every wind of doctrine that has hurt, that has hurt and has come against the church of the living God. But the bride of Jesus Christ stays back to one thing that the message is the truth. And the angel of the Lord always accompanies the message. We realize this that when God saw you like a little bitty lily coming out of the mud of your own life and people threw more mud over in that pile, they threw belief of sign on it, but you still kept rising up. They threw this on top of it, but you still kept rising up because it was not you. It was something THAT THE ALMIGHTY GOD HAD DEPOSITED ON THE INSIDE OF YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. Before you could MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE, BEFORE YOU COULD MAKE THE WRONG CHOICE, GOD SAW YOU WHEN MEN DID NOT CHOOSE YOU. GOD CHOSE YOU. THAT WHATSOEVER THINGS YOU DESIRE WHEN YOU PRAY, BELIEVE IT AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT. &gt;&gt; GOD KNEW THAT HE HAD A BUSINESS PARTNER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; When Mr. skeptic and Mr. IMPATIENT AND MR. UNBELIEF, DOUBT IT. HE had somebody in business with him that would not give up, THAT WOULD NOT GIVE IN, THAT WOULD NOT BACK UP. THAT'S WHO GOD [screaming] HAS CALLED. &gt;&gt; A people that could be restored back. &gt;&gt; People saw you and had they looked at your life, they said, "You'll never make it." When they looked at me, the people that once knew me and they found out I was a preacher, you know what they said, brother Ern? They said they didn't know that you could ordain the devil. But God saw something. It's kind of like that violin that was up for auction one day &gt;&gt; AND IT HAD ZERO VALUE TO IT. NOBODY WAS WILLING TO SPEND A DOLLAR TO IT. NOBODY WAS WILLING TO GIVE 50 CENT TO IT. BUT THE MASTER STEPPED UP THERE IN THE CORRECT MOMENT. YOU KNOW GOOD AND WELL IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE MASTER IN YOUR MOMENT WHEN MEN was giving up on you, WHEN MEN WAS DOUBTING YOU, HE SAID, "WAIT JUST A MINUTE. HALLELUJAH. Now she's ready to play. You see, you couldn't play that sweet music in that condition. So the message of restoration come across your life. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And he knew how to just put that rosm on there, right? because he knows that if you don't have that sweet oil of the Holy Spirit over your life and somebody goes to playing the wrong thing or trying to play the thing across your life, you'll just blow up and break. So therefore, he let the message get to you before man could ever get to you. When man trying to kick you out of church, God said, "Wait just a minute. I got to tune it up just a little bit." They've been sitting in the closet for a little too long, and it's time I know they got the ability to do it. I can I can tighten it down just a little bit more. Preaching on that clothesline religion. I No, they can handle it. They can handle it. They can handle it. I know. I know what they're built to do. Nobody thought you was worth anything, Brother Teddy. But all of a sudden, the master takes his bow across it and he starts breathing out amazing grace. How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like Teddy. Hallelujah. And then all of a sudden, you wasn't worth 50 cents no more. You was worth a hundred and worth 200. Now 3,000. Now 4,000. Who give ME 5,000? WHO WHO GIVE ME 10,000? Who give ME 20,000? WHO GIVE ME 100? WAIT A MINUTE. THAT'S A STRAT OF VARIOUS. THAT'S THE GREATEST POSITION THAT A MUSICIAN COULD EVER COME TO. I'VE GOT TO LET HIM COME TO THIS POSITION BECAUSE GOD KNEW WHAT YOU HAD ON THE INSIDE of you. That's why he let the message come by your way. There's some people that say it's too hard. They say it's too difficult to live, but me it's everything. &gt;&gt; You imagine when Eve makes this terrible mistake. She's not a prophet. She don't have the ability to have the foresight to see her mistake of what it's going to do. that in that moment, that one act of evil, in that moment, every evil thing was conceived right there. I don't think she looked out here and saw Sister Wanda fighting cancer. Thank God for a great report. I don't think that Eve looked all the way out here and saw Brother Ron fighting for his life. I really don't think that she saw you, brother Michael, fighting through Leodysia as a teenager's boy. I don't believe she had that kind of insight. I don't think she had the kind of insight, Sister Kimberly, to look out there 4,000 years from that moment and see a man out there in cave and he's bound up with chains. He's bound up there. He's possessed. He is completely untameable. He's the first streaker in the Bible. He is naked. He's afraid. He's hiding. He is running away. I'd say that Eve did not realize what she was doing. &gt;&gt; You see, because she listened to the wrong tree. &gt;&gt; But one day, the right tree come walking by Legion's WAY AND SAID, "I WILL RESTORE. ALL THE YEARS THAT SATAN HAS ROBBED YOU AND CHEATED YOU AND TRIED TO STEAL FROM YOU. I [screaming] WILL RESTORE." THERE'S A TREE THAT SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO DIE. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER TREE THAT SAYS I WILL RESTORE. &gt;&gt; I will restore. &gt;&gt; I got more to go. But I want to close out with this little thought. Brother Brandon would talk about a man and his boat. He would talk about a man that was a drifter. You remember that come by his way and he drifted wherever his hat was. You remember he said that he said it reminded him about that little boat. He said it's made out of wood and he said it goes around the turns of life. And he said, "You see that little wood that gets caught in the turn down there?" He said, "It's that old driftwood." He said, "That's what that drifter." He said, "He had no ambition about life. He had no power to get out of the situations that he was in." He said, "It's that like that little driftwood. It has no ability to get out of the turns of life." He said, "But you take a boat that is made out of that same kind of wood." He said, "And you put a power behind it, like a little motor behind it." He said it has the ability even though it's trapped up against the currents. He said it can get its way out of there. &gt;&gt; You remember that little story? That little story about that little bitty boy that had that sailboat and he absolutely loved it. He built it all the way up from his little youth. He built it up. He loved it. He made everything. He made he his mama his mama had made the little sails on it and different things and he'd spent much time and he spent a lot of time with it. He painted it and he he he put all that lacquer on it and different things and he took it out upon the lake one day and the lake got there and he had it out there and it was floating. Brother Elijah, it was out there floating and the wind got a hold of it and blew that little sailboat all the way across the other side of the lake and he lost his little sailboat. You see, he looked for it. He loved it with everything that was within him. It meant something to him. He he had created it himself. He'd spent some energy in it. He loved it and he looked for it everywhere. He went throughout life and he was looking for it and he couldn't find it. But one day he got to walking by a store and he looked on the inside of that store in that little store and there said his sailboat that he created. He looked in there and said, "THAT'S MY SAILBOAT. I created that. That's mine." And he didn't have the money at that time. So he ran back home and he got the money out of his piggy jar and he got it out. He broke his piggy bank and went there and got the money and he bought back that sailboat that was once his and he got that sailboat back in his hand. Hallelujah, brother Michael. He got it back in his hands. He said, "You are twice mine. You were mine when I created you and you're mine when I bought you back. You are twice mine." That's what the father is saying over your life, brother David. You are twice mine. You were mine when I created you AND YOU WERE MINE when I bought you back. Satan put you in the pawn store. BUT GOD SAID, "OH NO, MY BLOOD IS SUFFICIENT TO RESTORE EVERYTHING THAT SATAN'S PUT ON YOUR LIFE. [screaming] I WILL RESTORE. YOU are twice mine." [applause] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Won't you stand? &gt;&gt; I'm twice his. I'm twice his. There's a lot of people that go mincing down the street. There's a lot of people go along the way. Remember them little ladies, Brother Brandham saw in that hotel that time and they was up there screaming, "Whoopee!" He says, "Life." He said, "That ain't life. That's death." There's a lot of people going down the street mincing like Penny Pentecostal does going down the street. But there's something different about the way that you walk to this message. Hallelujah. It's something powerful behind the eye. You see, because I can say I'm going to do something. Lucifer can say that I'm going to do something. I will make myself like the most high God. But there's something powerful about when God says, "I &gt;&gt; I will restore." &gt;&gt; I'm going to read this quote. I've been going through question and answers. I'm just thinking on these things and just think about our young people. Young people, if you don't know the message, you want to learn more about it, go through question and answer. Brother Brandham says some very powerful things. So I've been going through those things trying to grab some nuggets from here and there to maybe encourage him. Brother Brandham has asked this question in questions answers said I've lived many years in sin until I found the Lord. Brother Brandham, I have sinned again and I'm not worthy to come before you in this holy place. Please tell me if I can be restored whole again. Let me say this to you. You come to this message, you come to the right spot. &gt;&gt; Please tell me if I can be restored whole again. You ever had that kind of wondering what God attitude is? Please tell me, can I be restored whole again? Not broken, not put back together, &gt;&gt; but whole. Can I be restored? You see, there are certain things about me when I go to putting something back together, you'll see all the cracks. You'll see the glue. You'll see the tape. But when God puts something back together, you don't see the glue. You don't see the residue. You don't see the scar because God's a healer. Please tell me, can I be restored whole again? I'm so thankful that this brother or sister asked this question. Yes, you have not sinned, my friend, so far in God, but what you could be restored. &gt;&gt; If you had sinned so far that you could not be restored, you'd never want to be restored. &gt;&gt; But as long as there's something dealing with your heart, &gt;&gt; you're still in line for restoration. As long as there's something dealing with your heart, &gt;&gt; you're still in line for restoration. I say this to you, don't you give up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't you give up. They ain't in the line of McDonald's and Wendy's and all these. They are in line for restoration. &gt;&gt; You hear me? They are in line for restoration. And you just wait. If it wasn't God dealing with their heart, then they would not even be in the line. BUT BECAUSE THE FATHER HAS THEM IN HIS MIND, HE'S GOT THEM RIGHT in line. &gt;&gt; RIGHT IN LINE. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HE SAYING? IT'S A CHURCH THAT IS GETTING BACK IN STEP. &gt;&gt; God bless you. I will. I will. I wonder if we had to go to bed tonight and this was the last thing that the father would speak to us. Three words. I &gt;&gt; will restore. &gt;&gt; Joy has been taken from you. I will restore. &gt;&gt; Peace has been taken from your home. I will restore. Faith has been robbed from you. I will restore. Your father, your husband, your mother, your sister, your brother. I will restore. I'd say it's time that you do like little David when everything's been robbed from you. The Bible said that David was greatly distressed because the people talked about stoning him. &gt;&gt; But David didn't sit down in defeat. &gt;&gt; The Bible said that David looked over there by heart and said, "Would you mind bringing me an ephod?" &gt;&gt; WHAT DID DAVID DO IN THE WORST OF TIMES? HE SAID, "Bring me the place where I can worship." RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BRING ME BACK TO A HEART OF WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE DAVID REALIZED THAT I WILL BLESS THE LORD AT ALL TIMES. &gt;&gt; DAVID DIDN'T SIT DOWN IN DEFEAT when everybody was AGAINST HIM. &gt;&gt; DAVID INQUIRED OF THE LORD &gt;&gt; AND HE ENCOURAGED HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; What did he encourage himself in? Psalms 51. I will restore restore unto you the joy of thy salvation. I WILL [screaming] LIFT UP MY VOICE TO THE ALMIGHTY AND HE WILL INCLINE HIS EAR TO MY HEART. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; David encouraged himself in the words of the Almighty. &gt;&gt; And I love what David asked. God, should I go after that need? Should I go after that little lamb? Should I go after my wife? Should I go after my possessions, my cattle, my sheep, my land, my daughters? And God said one word, pursue. &gt;&gt; That's all David needed. &gt;&gt; That's all David needed. &gt;&gt; I say that's all you need. &gt;&gt; Pursue. The enemy's taken that from you. Pursue. And then God comes behind it and says, "Don't just get it some back. Don't just get your money back. Don't just get your wife back. Don't just get your joy back. Don't just get your dance back. Just don't get your shout back. Recover it all. &gt;&gt; I will restore." &gt;&gt; I know God speaking to your heart. &gt;&gt; I know that. So refuse to stay in a dead condition. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts. Father, you realize the power of this moment that we're in. Eve didn't realize the power of the moment she was in. Lord, if we could realize the power of our choice right here, right now [music] from our heart, the things that we'll decide. Lord, if Eve could have [music] put a scale over there beside her on this decision or that decision, do I do it? Do I not? God, your plan had to [music] be unfolded. I wonder if we realize the power of our choice right now. What would take place? What would happen? Lord, the Bible would say because of [music] one sin, that one person couldn't enter into the congregation because of that one choice for 10 generations. And the prophet said, "What about a [music] positive choice?" Father, I wonder what would take place right now if we just start speaking things into existence that whatsoever [music] things we desire when we pray, we believe that we shall have them. If Eve by that powerful of decision could sit there [music] and say, "I choose to take on that seed." What would happen when we would sit here and say, "I don't want to take on God's seed. I want to let it fully manifest his glory in my life and express the [music] Godhead deity through me. Father, what would happen if moms and daddies got to back [music] to praying and made a decision? What would happen? I could say this. The father would say, "I will restore." Lord, I pray [music] tonight for every person here and under the sound of my voice. Lord, my hand, my heart, everything about me is before you. Lord, I don't even [music] have to ask you, but Lord, I'm going to go pursue it and I'm going to recover it all. Father, restore unto me the joy of my salvation. Father, we could ask him to step out and Lord, [music] you see their hearts just now. And I pray Lord the master of the universe would go across their [music] life just now and let the word take the bow of thy word and stream it across [music] their life in Jesus name. Amen. Never [music] will I praise you. You're the healer of my heart. [music and singing] Healer of the broken pieces. [music and singing] You touch this [music] made it new. Now my [music and singing] whole life I surrender. Lay it down before the men. [music and singing] Oh, love the sought before I knew you has brought [music] me near to where [singing] you are. Oh, [music] now I live to praise you. Oh, wherever may I praise you? [music] You're the healer of my heart. Let's have that verse [music] one. Oh. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Make of all we are. I was [singing] the &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; vessel in [singing] your hand. [music] You looked beyond the hurt and [singing] made me whole again. Healer of the broken pieces. [music and singing] You touched my heart and made [music and singing] it new. Now my [singing] whole life I surrender. [music] Lay it down before the mener. [singing] Lord, I give my life [music] to you. The love [music and singing] I saw before I knew you [music] has brought me near to where you are. [music] Now I live to praise [music and singing] you and ever may I praise you. You're the healer [singing] of my heart. Once again, healer [singing] of the broken [music] pieces. You touched my heart and made [singing] it new. [music] Now [music and singing] my whole life I surrender. Lay it [music] down before the [singing] mener. Lord, I give my life to [music] you. The love I saw [music] before I knew [singing] you [music] has brought me near to where you are [music] now. I live to praise you. Ever may I praise you. You're [music] the healer of my heart. The [music] love I [singing] sought before I knew you has brought me near [music] to where you are [singing] [music] now. How I live to praise you. [music and singing] Ever may I praise you. You're the healer of [music] my heart. Now I live to praise you. And ever may I praise [music and singing] you. You're the healer of my heart. [music and singing] heart. Is he the healer of your heart tonight? &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful that he can come down and [music] mend the broken pieces in your life? No matter what it is in your life that's broken, he can fix it. Amen. You give life. [singing and music] You are love. You bring light to the darkness. You give hope. You [music] restore every heart that is broken. [music and singing] Great are you, Lord. It's [music] your breath in [singing] our lungs. [music] So we pour out our praise. We pour out our praise.

All the [singing and music] earth will shout your praise. Our hearts will [music] cry. These bones [singing] will sing. Great are [music and singing] you, Lord. [music] And all the earth will shout your praise. [music] Our hearts will cry. These [singing] bones will sing. Great [music] are you, Lord. Is he great? [music] And all the [singing] earth will shout [music] your praise. Our hearts will cry. These bones will sing. [music] Great are you, [music] Lord, and it's your breath in our lungs. He gives [music] the breath of life, church. Hallelujah. Pour out your praise to him. Hallelujah. [music] He gives all things life. So we pour out our praise to you [music] only. It's your breath in our [music and singing] lungs. So we'll pour out our praise. We'll pour out our praise. It's your breath, [music] Lord, in our lungs.

Who taught the [music] son where to stand in [singing] the morning? And who told [music] the ocean, "You can only come [singing] this far." And who showed [music] the moon where to hide [singing] to leave stand. [music] Well, I know my redeemer [music and singing] lives. lives. I know my [music and singing] redeemer he lives. And let all [music] creation testify. Let this [music] light within me cry. I know [music and singing] my redeemer lives. [music] The very same God that spins things [music] in orbit.
