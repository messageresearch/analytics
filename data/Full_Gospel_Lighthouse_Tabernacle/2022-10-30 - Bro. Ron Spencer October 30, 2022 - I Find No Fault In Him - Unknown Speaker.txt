Florida from North Carolina then from from Illinois and his mom his mother's eight a 78 years old and she watches our Sunday morning service and very much blessed by it and his father his name is Ron

scripture with the first one this morning Our Father which is hard in heaven amen maybe you have a need this morning you'd like to say brother Ron would you remember me amen I'd like to bring it before the Lord let's just pray pray almighty God we love you with all of our hearts we ask you to forgive us of all of our sins and our mistakes and failures now Lord we're not looking to one another we're looking to you you're our champion you're our hero you're our great sacrifice today [Music] songs have been sung about you now we turn to your word may we find ourselves even in a greater spot today Lord you know how to take an audience like we have here this morning and speak to every heart I ask you to anoint lips and anoint the mind of a man to get out of the way that you'd use the vessel to speak to your audience not just here but also the invisible those that are sick we have brother TJ's family that has been sick this week all week we ask you to touch their body others that are sick we ask you that you'd ministered to them in a special way Lord those that are moving today Lord I just ask you there's a lot of Bittersweet things that happen in that but I ask you that you would just come and touch their hearts and strengthen them for the journey in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen and isn't he wonderful amen if you return with me to Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9. and then we'll go to Saint John chapter 18 and verse 38. I'd like to speak to you this morning on I find no fault in him amen amen this is going to turn out to be a good spot if you if you can kind of stay with me this morning first of all this is Jesus's prayer to give us wisdom of how to talk to him and it's very powerful in every words and after this manner therefore pray ye and let's pray it together Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen amen Saint John chapter 18 and verse 38. and pilate saith unto him what is truth and that's a powerful question what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the Jews and said unto them I find in him no fault at all now remember who's saying this the enemy your enemy will have to testify now think about this your enemy will have to testify for you to get a rapture I find no fault you can be seated Hallelujah brother Branham says in what thank you of Christ he says let's call another Witness I don't believe there's a better witness that ever lived than his mother that's right met Mary you're the one who brought him here let's ask Mary the virgin whose son is he Mary you ought to know you're his mother and she said I I knew not a man Hallelujah but the Holy Ghost overshadowed me and said the holy thing will be called the son of God and I believe the Son of God don't you yes sir whose son is he why did he have to be born virgin birth because it was sex in the garden and he had to redeem every sin so he had to come through that type of a birth it could not be by man it had to be by God it could not be part Mary and part god it had to be all God let's ask the Roman soldier who pierced his side seen this blood coming out of him what thank ye about him he said surely that was the son of God remember the scripture says not one bone will be broken and they went to break these bones but the scripture said it will not one bone will be broken couldn't be a blemish on his side when that Soldier stuck that spear in his side it released his spirit and it released his blood and his water he did every one of us a favor oh Hallelujah let's think of Judas his enemy let's see what his enemy said Judas what do you think about him he said oh I have betrayed innocent blood give me a rope that I can hang myself and hear caiaphasis here's your money I betrayed innocent blood his enemy was testifying about him let's look at pilate the great lawyer a great man of the day a proclamator let's ask him what did you think about him Pilate come on out of hell and raise up here you say was he in Hell sure he was he is yet what do you say that I ain't judging him but hit by his own fruits what did you think about him pilate sitting there he said oh one day I was sitting there and I find no thought in him he said let's just turn the scene for a minute I can just see him standing there looking looks around in his angered eyes looking at him trying to find something wrong with him then he thought he would find some favor with Caesar and so forth and I hear a horse coming listening listen at it it's coming up the road and as hard as it can come and what is it it's one of the temple guards and he jumps off and he Dismounts it runs up before Pilate and Bows himself and hands in a note let's see it pallity opens up the node and he begins to read it and his face turns white his eyes are set his his knees Buckle together what's the matter let's look let's look over his shoulder and see what it is and when I read that I think about a prophet in a vision sorry and he's watching the scene happen and he said it's from his wife my beloved husband a heathen she was my beloved husband have nothing to do with this just man for today I've suffered many things in a dream he was he was white in his face his bones went out of joint his knees buckled together the great proclamator what do you think of him Pilate I must wash my hands no you never he's still on your hands he's on the hands of every man this afternoon that hears the message of Jesus Christ what do you think of him whose son is he why in birth he was wonderful in his birth did you believe it in his birth he was wonderful in wisdom there was never a man that spake like him do you believe that in sacrifice he was perfect in death he was a redeemer when he arose he proved he was God he said he was and when he was here on Earth he said he was God and he looked like God he acted like God he preached like God he rose like God he was God brother Brown said either he was God or he was the greatest deceiver that the world has ever known [Applause] Emmanuel veiled in flesh walking among man he was God Emmanuel he fulfilled the father he thrilled the hearts of the points Great Men down Through the Ages Every Man that's ever amounted to a hill of beans was somebody that put their trust in him as a Son of God I like that every man that and every man that ever amounted to a hill of beings was somebody that put their trust in him that's where I put my trust today [Applause] Hallelujah and it came to pass as they were alone praying his disciples were with him and they asked him and he asked them whom say the people that I am and the answer said John the Baptist but some say Elias and others that one of the old prophets has risen again and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Peter answering said the Christ of God what a statement I found this this week and I thought it was incredible saying I've given God a million reasons not to love me and none of them changed his mind I want you to say this with me maybe the next day you have a complex or fear situation devil beating you around I want you to just kind of say this back to him I've given God a million reasons not to love me and none of them changed his mind I'd like to share with you this morning he's not on a cross neither is he in a tomb but he is Our Risen Savior he came to Earth to die and he accomplished his purpose and today he is king of kings and Lord of lords he is our sacrifice our Lamb of God and we stand here today declaring that he is the worthy lamb and we say there's no thought in him in Revelations chapter 5 we pick it up and and I saw in the right hand of him that set upon the throne written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was a was able to open the book and to look there on and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book and to read the book neither to look thereon now I want you to just stop just for a moment and think about this of all the prophets and all the Great Men of all the ages in their Humanity of being Fallen human beings could not redeem themselves they couldn't pay the price for their own Redemption much less redeem all humankind are you with me there's a lot of brilliant men that can read the Bible and quote the Bible from beginning to end but they can't pay their own price of redemption and even John as he's standing there and the strong Angel proclaims who is Worthy Moses couldn't step forth Abraham couldn't step forth Isaac couldn't step forth Enoch who had wrote the Bible in a pyramid and actually walk with God and one day God just took him home Elijah the spirit of God in a man but there were thoughts in him each of these men each of these men had an accuser and God built his own accuser the accuser takes a tally of your wrongs and your thoughts it's got books of memory of where you made mistakes the scripture tells us that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God all have sinned and come short of the glory of God brother on but I haven't done no bad since our thoughts our very thoughts would condemn us today our attitudes our opinions on things we get sideways at times we get turned around and there is a book somewhere or another that is the accuser of the brethren all right yeah where's your brother Moses had to write about his own faults we heard last night that he turned down he turned down being pharaoh you know that just kind of falls off of her lips sometimes but we don't realize the implications that he went from he went he went from being the leader of the world to living in a tent with a hot tempered wife a pauper to where that the hot desert Suns would burn him and the accuser beating him for 40 years and living with his being a murderer and and making bad decisions brother man said he looked out the same window that Pharaoh Ramses looked out of Ramsay saw just people that were slaves and ants and and Moses looked out of there and he saw them as God's chosen people and when God puts a seed in your life and a gift in your life you can run to the ends of the world and you can't get away from it Hallelujah well I'm not going to serve God if God's got a seed on the inside of you you can go to Alaska you can go to Russia you can go to the you can go to any place in the world God knows how to find you and he's not in the kind of business to lose you no human could take credit for our Redemption no mortal man could take credit we needed a savior the blood of bulls and goats could pour rivers of blood it didn't save a man it only covered his sins it didn't take the sin desire out of his life David cried they all wanted God to they could feel his anointing but they they knew themselves and the flaws in their lives they knew that they needed that God that would come and touch them to live on the inside of them Moses knew Moses Abraham knew Abraham David knew David we needed more than a temple built by mortal hands notice these words John says I went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon listen if if God doesn't step forward we're lost and you're going to live to be 120 years life's short I don't want to serve him just because I don't want to go to hell I don't want to serve him just because I'm I'm afraid I want to serve him because of love life courage the strength that he gives me the grace and the mercy that carries us from day to day [Music] one of the elders responded we've not the lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed he's wrestled with Satan he's paid the price of redemption hack prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof those Seven Seals contained who Jesus Christ really was and who you really are and I'd be held in low in the midst of the throne in the four beasts and in the midst of the altars instead of lamb as it had been slain having salmon horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits sent forth into all the Earth one in each age and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him it was a book of redemption it was your Bible that you hold in your hand he then took the right out of the hand of him that sat on the throne and when he had taken the book and the four beasts and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having having every one of them hearts and golden vials of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by the by to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God's Kings and Priests and we shall reign with him on the Earth without this book without this Redemption there is no reigning with him and I beheld and heard a voice of them ain't Mighty Angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousands times ten thousands times thousands and thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings and I want to say this to you you were identified in him Hallelujah Hallelujah now the scripture says about him as a prophecy in Isaiah chapter 53. who hath believed I report and to whom this is a powerful scripture and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed it's not going to be revealed to everybody [Music] Benjamin Netanyahu this week went back to the old Testament and said this land belongs to us he stood in a speech and he said we must never forget who we are let me just say this here you must never forget who you are the Devil May whisper in your ear and tell you a lot of things but never let him forget who you are because you are the power that you have on the inside of you is where you know who you are not just enough to know who he is but to know who you are [Applause] for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground he hath no form no calmness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hear this before our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs buried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted this is all of our favorite scripture but he was wounded another Homer when we would pray for people at the hospital he would pray he was wounded for our transgressions he took those stripes at pilate's judgment Hall therefore we could be healed he wasn't being for uh irreverent with the scriptures he was quoting the scripture and then given the promise and then given people Faith get up and walk out of this bed but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed the scripture says in John chapter 1 and verse 1 in the beginning what's the word and the Word was with God and was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made that only explained it all right now in him was life and life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehended that not there was a man sent from God whose name was John and the same came for a witness to Bear witness of that lot remember Jesus even comes and testifies about John none greater than John and he said ought the same came for a witness to Bear witness of that light that all men threw him might believe he was not that light but he was sent to Bear witness of that Lodge that was the True Light which which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not there's a shirt there is a sermon in every sentence he came into his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were which were born not a blood nor of the will of Flesh nor the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory what a phenomenal sermon John under a prophetic Eagle anointing is writing this sermon down and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and we beheld his glory millions of Jews was in the land but a handful of men recognized this was God [Music] this was God you've heard me read this to you I'll read it again just a portion of it he came from the bosom of the father to the bosom of a woman he put on Humanity that he might put on divinity he became the son of man that he might become that we might become sons of God and that is phenomenally powerful he came from heaven where Rivers never freeze winds never blow Frost never chills the air flowers Never Fade one is never sick there's no Undertakers no graveyards no one ever dies no one ever is buried he was born contrary to the laws of nature he lived in popular in in poverty in total obscurity only crossed the boundary of his Land once in childhood had no wealth he had no influence no training no formal education his relatives were inconspicuous and and influent un influential in infancy he startled Kings in Boyhood he startled wise men in manhood he ruled the course of nature he walked on the billas of the sea he healed the multitudes without medicine and made no charge for his service he never wrote a book yet all the libraries of the country could not hold the books that had been written about him he never wrote a song you know yet he has furnished the theme of more songs than all the songwriters combined he never founded a college yet all the schools together cannot boast of as many students as he has he never practiced psychology yet is healed more broken hearts than doctors have healed broken bodies he never marshaled an army he never drafted a soldier fired a gun yet no leader has ever had more volunteers who under his orders have made Rebels stock arms of surrender without a shot being fired Jesus stood there and said let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also with me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you I think about that scripture when brother Branham is speaking four hours on future home no way can mortal man even as a prophet can stand there and describe the beauty of what our new Heavens was going to be like streets of gold transparent gold thank you walls of Jasper Gates apparel and that's one of the most precious items in the entire world peril it's hard to fathom Rivers flowing from the Throne of God said flowing down over that City and he said he built it 1500 miles high in 1500 miles wide honey and he said it that Divine architect he said it's built it so beautiful in in such a way until it feels like you're going to be walking on flat ground get an engineer to try to build such a city with Mortal Humanity go walk on the the pyramids in Egypt you're going to need a lot of steps but God Divine he so designed your city where he's going to have you to live at where he's going to have you to live at where you're going to live and he's got it so designed not a leaf ever false the grass never weathers the flowers you're talking about bershard Gardens and some of the gardens and and some of the places that I've been how beautiful they are but still they wither and the seasons come and change but in that Gardens the leaves will never fall off there will never be a Bad Day in heaven Hallelujah I go to prepare a place for you or powerful words as he stood there with them this is just shortly before Calvary all right hello Stephen they've witnessed him walk on water spoke to a storm and they witnessed him it just become glass and they used the term it said never man speak like this man he exhibited such power with such humility had no house to live in had no Chariot to ride had no Castle to go to and yet he could control nature don't tell me God can't do the impossibility for you well brother Ron you're you stand there with cancer still in your body and they say it's just as much hmm what cancer the god that spoke to a storm can speak to that we're taught not to be be fearful of it oh it causes effects I've had I went on a hunting trip and I was sick you know and I had problems but that's just temporary there'll be a day to where that can't touch me [Applause] this might be to somebody that's listening but it's been said by more more than just a few men Billy Graham was one of the last ones that would say say it nationally or even to the world he said if you hear Billy Brown Billy Graham died he said don't believe it for a second because I'll be more alive there than I am here and if you can grasp that Paul said it as well a man that got his head chopped off and he said to be absent from this body listen you can't do anything with a man that knows his destiny I'm saying powerful words right here you can't do anything to a man that knows his destiny I know where I'm going I know the situation I'm well aware in this Humanity I make struggle but in another Realm to be absent from this body is to be present with the Lord [Applause] a couple scriptures later Jesus saith unto them I am the way the truth and the life there's not another way than Jesus there's not 14 different ways he is away as a matter of fact he's the only way to escape hell to escape the tribulation period this is the way to know me is not to know too much but to know him gives you eternal life no man cometh unto the father but by me John chapter 3 and verse 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent his son into the world to condemn to condemn the world but to to but that the world through him might be saved and he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already you don't have to wait on the Judgment because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God Hallelujah you say well I had my ups and downs ups and downs I would advise you to go to God and stay there until you're really born again When Trials and troubles and heartaches and disappointments sets in something holds not not you holding something's holding you it isn't a question whether I hold on or not it's a question whether he held or not it isn't looking at me it's looking at him brother Branham I'm not even worthy to be saved he said I told him no you're not that's a pretty that's a pretty powerful statement and no you're not he started weeping he said he said I've been trying since I was in 1940 to get saved but I find myself not worthy and he just clears it up for him you'll never be worthy [Applause] you'll never be worthy then I could never be saved he says oh no it isn't you that he's looking at it's him God don't look at you he looks at him if you can find any fault in him then you can't be saved but if there's no fault in him then you're all right the blemish that you find in him is you there's no blemish in you in him then now there's no blemish in you [Applause] quit letting the devil beat you around the bush God washes our blemishes away and then we can say I find no fault it's kind of like a man that goes and he says he said he'll start to die and with this disease on the doctor's doorsteps and he said the doctor has a remedy to give the man for his disease and he can help him with his medicine now you know in the early days preachers would preach against doctors you didn't have faith if you went to doctors or you didn't have faith if you went to Medicine and you know three years ago or two and a half years ago when I started having to go and begin to take chemotherapy which I take it every day still take as much as I've ever taken and take 27 pills in the morning and just to get my day started and I had a lot of people telling me said you don't have faith well they they didn't get it from Brother Branham and I just thought I'd go ahead and clear that up they they didn't get not believe in doctors because brother Branham had Dr Sam Adair and then he went to the Mayo Clinic and if you want to do a little home research on the Mayo Clinic they're some of the best doctors in the entire world and they actually did a study on brother Branham being able to see visions and I actually was in a home to where that I was in as a chimney sweep at that time and it was a it was a guy that was a a professor and his son was working at the Mayo Clinic and and you know he was just talking to me we'd been at his house several times and me and Dad was there together and we'd cleaned his chimney we was done and we were just talking he was just you know somebody's phone's going off and I hear it is it yours foreign all right well it's not God calling I'll never forget brother Homer one time when he was having a funeral here we put two seats right here and Homer wanted to sit near the stage here and his phone went off and he was always the guy that would say now he would always say your phone off and they say yeah it's awful well his phone's going off and he said hey folks it's it's not God you never got to meet him you're going to enjoy meeting him but anyway this man began to speak to me and he said you know he said my son is in research at the at the Mayo Clinic and he said you know there was you know how you have a dream he said you go to sleep you're in a deep sleep and deeper sleeps and he said dreams are about a second and a half he said you feel like that you dreamed all night long as about a second second and a half well I had a dream last night I dreamed that I was at uh at a house at a house of a sister uh shiftlet what's her what's her name June I was at June's house and she gave me a three monkeys See No Evil speak no evil and hear no evil that dream seemed like it went on forever a second and a half I knew this was in my sermon this morning I thought what an interesting dream she's going to give me three monkeys she hears this she don't have to do that anyway this man says you know a dream he said you he said you literally feel like you're living stirs your emotions it makes you mad it makes you cry and he said really not much to a dream he said but you just fall into it he said but there was a man said his conscience and his subconscious lay together now this guy don't know beans about who William brownham is and he's standing there talking to two message preachers come on God orchestrates everything and he's standing there talking to two message preachers and this guy is has a son working at Mayo Clinic researching all of these years later kind of how that worked and he said this man would would not dream dreams in the day but he would see visions and it would transport him as much as 40 days back and said there's there's stories that said it transported him all week by up to the days of Jesus [Applause] I said was his name William Branham he said yes that's a fact that's a that's who it that's who he's studying I've told you all of that to give you this quote now he said the doctor has the remedy to give the man of for his disease and he can help him with medicine but the man will not listen to him he just refuses to take the doctor's medicine well the man could be so close to the doctor he could he could be on the doorstep and die and die on his office step and live door neighbors to him and die with the disease that the medicine is laying in the doctor's office that could cure him now it isn't the doctor's fault notice what he does with this it isn't the doctor's fault it isn't because there's no medicine there it's because the man refuses the remedy stay with me put on your seat belt he dies because he refuses the remedy that the doctor has for his disease so it is with the church today men and women die in pews in sin because they refuse the remedy there is a bomb in Gilead there's a physician there but people refuse to take the remedy they don't want it it's a dangerous thing to refuse the doctor's medicine you got scarlet fever pneumonia whatever it is and the doctor gives you medicine and you just pour it out that's a dangerous thing because you might just die but how much more is it dangerous to pour out the bomb of God 's remedy let me just say this to you now you don't have to think very far to think about people in your family and in your life and I'm not being judgmental now that have turned down the remedy and the remedy was offered listen You'll have to walk Stomp jump over the blood of Jesus Christ to go to hell God has created every roadblock that he can for you to stop you long enough to speak to your heart he has chased you down you heard a song last night that was so powerful he ran to me pull me to his chest he left 90 and 9 and went and got you he don't just do that to waste his time help me lay it right now in his place God's on a mission he's on a mission and that mission will not fail there will be a bride everything that we have made of to put us in a Rapture is right here with us he wants us so live in your life well it's the doctor's fault it's the preacher's fault it's brother branham's fault here a while back maybe a few years ago or I got a movement they started pointing out brother branham's faults you know what then they started pointing out Jesus's faults then they started pointing out the Bible's faults well you've you've missed the whole picture to start off with Jesus could say things that brother Branham could say I came from God I'm going back to God we said because we're in him but we were born of Charlie and Christine Spencer and all the sins of their families came down on me and I had to be born again Jesus could say my meat my flesh is meat indeed brother Branham couldn't say that brother Bynum said I am a sinner saved by grace Jesus never said those words I'm a sinner he took on sin that you could become him he went to hell so you could go to heaven he walked through the regions of the Lost so you would never have to take a footstep there let me just let me just say it as I'm coming to a close I'll speak in a couple of weeks on this but let me just say you're as close to hell as you'll ever be what a statement you are as close to hell as you'll ever be and sinners are as close to Heaven as they'll ever be virtual we must be careful when we point out one another's mistakes and I want to leave you with this thought because as Mortals no mortal has a right to stand in the presence of God and condemn another mortal whether you know it or not a person can make an ultimate sin and ask God to forgive us that's not giving you a license to repeat it that's not making Grace a disgrace but when you ask God to forgive you of your sins the god of Heaven that created the sun moon and stars can never remember that ever again [Music] he can never hold it against you because he prepared a blood for that you talking about the power of the blood of Jesus Christ what can we wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of Jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory to God when we walk through that corners of Heaven I don't know quite how to be brother Graham tried to explain it but kind of like a parade when we enter oh and we'll sing Amazing Grace as we walk in and they said angels will stand they don't know they can't sing with us because they don't understand Grace we do we know how close we came and we wasn't even redeemable ourselves but God was rich in Mercy to us amen God bless you resistance if you'll come I find no fault in him God's not looking at you the way you look at you he's actually looking at himself because he picked you I know this is so simple but it's so profound and so late our humanity is so quick to judge it's so quick to judge it's so it's so phenomenally quick while you're standing there let me just give you one more story it was a Sunday and brother Branham couldn't find a restaurant open Jason he walks into a bar that was a restaurant Israel there was a policeman over there on slot machines woman hanging on him he looked over the woman there there's men talking to her brother Brandon said God why don't you just wipe this this whole place off of the map Brotherhood said to Angel the Lord pulled him around behind the door you know the story well he showed him a vision Jesus came ably like the sins of the world toward Calvary [Music] and he asked him said is that the sins of the world he said no they're your sins brother random found himself in a completely different place after that Vision [Music] he walked over to that woman said I'd like to talk to you she said I've gotten somebody with me before long you begin to talk to her about her life oh she'd been a Christian and she got away from God foreign but God had to get him past his judgmental spirit that he could have Grace for that woman and he said in just a little bit we were down on our knees praying [Music] leading her back to God I don't know who you'll lead to Jesus Christ maybe it'll be in a hunting camp [Music] somebody will see your life that's what happened this last week I didn't get a deer but I got something more precious than a deer Souls worth 10 million whirls [Music] I'd have loved to got that here for you 200 inches [Music] but I got something so much more better than a deer to know Jesus is worth it all maybe you've been running for a long time and he's rooted over your heart today you say Lord touch my life Lord touch my judgmental Spirit touch my critical attitude Lord help me to even get away from this self-condemning spirit Romans chapter 8 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus [Music] don't waste today don't waste a month don't waste a year somebody's watching your life you're affecting somebody your influence is somebody whether you're in school or whether you're in college or whether you're on a public job or you're a construction worker whoever you are people are watching your life may they not see you [Music] a man of failures and amount of mistakes Jesus may they see Jesus and at the end of the day Satan will have to look at you and say I find no fault [Music] I've got nothing to hold him here I've got nothing to prevent him from going into rapture the blood is so atoned the life is so applied [Music] not just one by one but around the world a step from this Dimension to another dimension Heavenly Father we feel your presence now Lord we ask you luscious Ness cleanse us today mentally physically spiritually down to our soul today Father Satan can attack her body neither can attack our spirit that's the Realms that he is allowed to do and he can remind us of a memory Channel he could take us through the emotions warring with us anxieties and all kind of depressions but there's a blood that is so much greater than the memory Channel the affections of our life come today Lord Jesus come minister to us [Music] Polly could never wash the blood off of his hands [Music] thank you he lived in horror of the rest of his life [Music] because that blood was on his hands we hear our Prophet go what will you lay ought to see you what would you do with this
