the Lord Jesus man any man if you have your Bibles this evening we're turning over in the book of Deuteronomy 29 and 29 and then down to Genesis chapter 12 and verse 1 and we want to continue with the thought that the Lord is placed on my heart on where where we belong where we belong sister-sister linda craigger was speaking to my wife last weekend and sister katie was asking her how how her week win and she said oh it's just been so good she said she said this is this is a place that I feel like I belong and this is the only place that has ever told me that this is where I belong I believe that I believe this is the place that we belong that church and the revealing of the son of man I believe that this is the hour that we're living in we're feeding not feeding on the mind of a man but we're feeding on the unfailing body word the son of man and as I said we'd like to speak to you on this autumn and where we belong the Bible says here is we've read it in the fat the past couple weekends that the secret things belong to the Lord our God but those things which are revealed to belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law Genesis chapter 12 and verse 1 now the Lord that's unto Abram excuse me I'll allow you to find your places now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house and unto a land that I will show thee and I will make a V a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed may God bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord where we belong I believe that we are here I believe that these are the moments that we were destined for in life and I believe that this is where we belong in the hour that we're living in I believe that this message is him I believe that brother Branham did not come to vindicate himself but I believe that the prophet of the Lord perfectly proved our Lord Jesus Christ I believe that I believe that that this this word will put us right into a body change you know I find that I find a lot today that people just seem like they can't fit in somewhere but I found the place I have found the place where I belong you know you find it amongst people there sometimes searching out which way they need to go and and where they need to be in life but I have found the place where I belong at you know I know that I may repeat some things this evening that we've spoken the past or the past couple of weekends but I believe they bear repeating but I believe that that that we are seeing a young people as they're finding their position I believe that we're watching the Church of the Living God as they're coming to their position and and we know that that when the church knows therefore the position of what she is that the rapture will happen and we're we're watching these things manifest right in front of our eyes and we as we see here as we've read that we see God that God is giving Abram Amanda and a promise God is giving Abram a command to come out of the land in which he was born in a land that he has known all of his life he's giving him a command to come out of that land but he's giving him a promise he's giving him a promise to go to a land that he ain't ever seen before but I want you to notice the character of Abraham and the notice how how close that Abraham was to God that if you look from the transition from Genesis chapter 11 to Genesis chapter 12 that that has been calculated that there was four hundred and twenty years since God had opened his mouth and they spoke to know of these things and now here God is opening his mouth again to speak to his servant Abraham it is testifying of the life of which Abraham lived that he was ordained to be the father of Nations you see this command that God was giving to him to leave that place to leave that place of old and fond associations for a land which he had not seen he was sending him to a place or directing him by to a place of the unseen a place that he didn't know about he was going to a place that was prepared for a people you see God had told Abraham that I'm going to give you this land that it's your land if you look over in Genesis 13 he tells him to walk through that land that it's your land it belongs to you look to the north look to the south look everywhere all that you see I've given you that land it's your land it belongs to you it's your possession it's for your children and it's for your seed that's coming after them you know but the Bible says in Acts chapter 7 and 5 that Abraham never stood foot on that land but yet his seed after him stood on that land so Abraham stood on that land you see God's got a work for you to do if you go over and you look at it at Phillip at his revival when he was down there in Samaria you know that the prophet of the Lord said that when Jesus was speaking to the woman at a wail that Jesus never did one miracle there he just preached to them the Word of God because you realized the profit of the Lord said that there was a revival that was coming and it was a work of Philip that he was to do you know that there are things that that you are manifested and your promise to do these things belong to you tonight Church you see that he told him to walk through this land Abraham couldn't see all of it Abraham maybe as he was coming out of the land of his father he couldn't see the land which God was going to give him but he was not looking through the eyes of doubt he was looking through the eyes of faith he was looking at the purchased possession which God had given him and you know if I find sometimes as humans that we get caught up in the delay and we get caught up in the details of life we get caught up in those things and that's where the devil battles us is in the details what why hasn't God done this yet or why hasn't God moved yet he said that he would heal me he said that he would deliver me we get caught up in the details of time but God's Word is right on time he said that he's already healed you that by His stripes that you're already healed that's a sure word of prophecy for you it is just human here to hear the word that it will stir up your pure Minds by the way of remembrance that this word was giving to you that he's already said that he healed you that he's already celled that he that he said that he delivered you if God is not as good as his word we need to back off everything that he's written in this word but this belongs to you Church every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse and every line every single one of them is there for me and the devil may try to keep me off of my property but this is what God has given done to me is that right so don't get caught up in the details and don't get caught up in the devil's handiwork where he tries to make you disbelieve and make you doubt but you hold on to God's promise God said he bring him in God's gonna bring them in God said it he'll yeah he's already he'll Chuck but may he quicken your faith to bring it up to a higher level so that you can soar into the heavenlies the devil wants to keep you down but we are knowing at church what are we anointed by by what Eve turned down we accept Oh hallelujah wants the anointed man now the anointed bride hallelujah we are in the hour of the anointing of a bride we have responded we are subjects to the bridegroom's call have you heard him calling out to you you know God is the one that gave the promise hallelujah man didn't make this promise do you think Abraham as a human being dealing with the five senses that you have to deal with could see it in his own human natural realm that he was living in could see a land in which he was born to possess he could not see it in the five senses but faith is the sixth sense God was the one that gave the promise to Abraham and to his seed after them but the promise remained no matter what Abraham went through he went through old age and the promise remained he went through maybe different trials of his life of the promise remained and God would tell him that his seed was secured in a strange land and the promise remained through all the patriarchs of Abraham it remained through Isaac it remained through Jacob it remained for Joseph it remained the promise was there and then there rose above Pharaoh which knew not Joseph and the promise still remained 400 years of slavery and the promise still remained 400 years of the devil trying to beat the promise out of them but the promise still remain 400 years where they would stand there and try to knock can destroy the image of God and destroy the promise of God and try to beat it out of their memory but the promise still remains when they were getting down while they were there getting whipped while they were down there making bricks while they were down there marching in the mud the promise still remained it may look like it ain't coming but I want you to know he's away maker he's a miracle worker he's a promise keeper the promise is on its way the promise still remains whether you got cancer the promise still remains whether he got sugar diabetes he's the LORD thy God that heals all of that diseases the promise still remains [Applause] through the beatings through the scourge ins the promise still remain and Satan done his very worst to beat it out of the children of his flock he tried his very best to destroy this bride but he couldn't keep her down Satan done his worst but the promise still remained you see because there may have been some people that died but there may have been some people that didn't believe but the promise still remains there was a Joshua that rose up and said this is our land the promise is ours the promises to Abraham seen and we are Abraham's seed it belongs to us if Joshua could stand there and just have the anointing of the Holy Ghost come and go what about us tonight what about us that are born against sons and daughters of God does the promise still remain for us the devil may with you around but does the promise still remain the devil make torment you on your job but does the promise still remain a little earlier for the people of the land were the people of the land America is my home country this land is our land this lands worth fighting for reason we can stand here worship like we do is because there was somebody that went before us that believed in the same promise that America was a land that a land of the free and the home of the brave that was somebody that thought that it was worth fighting for they thought it was worth dying for you see if you don't think it's not for you we'll back up but if you believe it's worth dying for you give you all to it and there were some that gave some and some gave all the reason we stand here as a free nation is because somebody thought that this was their land come on somebody when Germany tried to take it when resume trying to take it this was America's land and somebody rose up and said I'll fight for this land what about the children of God and said this is our land let the devil come this is our land [Applause] brother Seth I'm coming for you tonight with everything that's within me this is your promise this is your land it belongs for you deliverance belongs to you Healing belongs to you we belong in the place of healing hallelujah the promise still remains hallelujah when I've seen your pastoring off the scene the promise still remains there's gonna be a people that take a rapture there may be something go by the way

you know who dines just part of living he said the doctor said that it almost retards the case every single time he said what about what about those that it's been inspired by the Holy Ghost he said when they can come to that spot when they can come to that spot that you realize Oh hallelujah I'm not quoting the Prophet right now I'm talking about my own time but speaking from my own self but when you can find the spot that you belong in and tell the devil you can't take me back to your spot I'm in God's you confess these things I'm ordained to live I'm not ordained to die I'm ordained to give God praise i'm predestinated to live i predestinated to to speak the word i'm predestinated to live a holy life you remember what brother Donnie preached here on confession that he told us what

remember that time when brother Branham when brother Branham was dealing with a man from Kentucky and he told him he'd come out after he preached the message and they come out and told him so brother Branham he said I appreciate everything you say is a man I appreciate you as a man he said but I can't stand for anything that you're preaching he said I can't stand for I can't I can't accept divine healing I can't accept anything that I don't see brother Branham asked him where he lived that when you remember he asked him where he lived that he saw he said I will I he said I live across that mountain there and he said well he said do you see your home he said no he's who how you gonna find that home he said well there's a path that leads over there he said how you gonna see that path he said well you see I got this lantern right here and he said the lander and we'll light the footsteps where I'm going he said I thought you said you couldn't accept anything you didn't see come on somebody what about you tonight maybe you don't see it on its row but I'm telling you it's on its Road we're walking in the light as he is the light hallelujah we're marching onward Christian soldiers marching ask the Lord maybe we don't see the end of it plainly but we're walking and we know that it'll be there it's a promise to us turn with me to revelations chapter 5 and verse 1 my businness awe in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor an earth nor under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon it imagined how John is feeling right here after seeing his name on the book and there's nobody worthy to step up they looked all over the earth and there was nobody worthy and he began to weep much because there was nobody that was found worthy and verse 5 it says then one of the elders say them to me we've not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book Alleluia to Lambs job and to loose the seven seals thereof and be and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne as a four and the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are seven spirits of God sent forth in all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are in the prayers which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song oh yeah they say the new song they believe the ageless the elders believed in singing a new song and they sing a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and they open the seals thereof there was our slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood of out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation you talking about a time when John saw this when he was caught up this was in symbolism of what the lamb has released in this day and the lamb stood up and said I am worthy to claim the book I'm worthy to claim those names that are on that book and John said all things in heaven all things under the earth heard me shouting blessings glory honor and power you talking about a certain service you think we have one here what about old John in symbolism of you and me when we realize that our names are on the book and he hath redeemed us it makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus oh no I don't believe that John was saying it like that if John was singing that song it makes me wanna shout [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah and this line of the tribe of juda prevailed he said don't weep John for the Lion of the tribe of Judah and the root of David hath prevailed he's already overcome he's done it it's over John Luke he prevailed over death he prevailed and walked out of the grave I'm identified with him and as the song says if he walked out of the grave I'm walking - if he walked out I'm walking - if he overcame I'm overcoming to hell oh yeah that's my headship right there that's my king right there that's my Lord right there if he walked out I'm walking to I'm not stayin bound by the grave and dead bound by death I'm walking out of it the lamb has redeemed us back he's redeemed us Mac he took us out of the devil's pawn shop he paid the debt you ain't got to pay for it you ain't gotta beat yourself over and over over again because the things that you've done in your past stop beating yourself stop talking about the things that you used to do and the things of your past start talking about your future in God I don't care what you did while you is out there in the world my ears are not ears of trash my ears are to be things of glory and honor and praise to the king yeah I was lost but I ain't lost no more yeah I was a sinner but I ain't a sinner no more I don't even belong identify with that man but people love they love talking about their past because they enjoy their past more than they enjoy their future that was free you see redemption means all illegal possessing to all that was lost by Adam and Eve brother Adam said Oh home I'll what that ought to do to a born-again Christian you see it's legal possessing to the abstract title deed the abstract deed title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything say everything that Adam and Eve lost the possession of that deed Adam could not meet the requirements of redemption after he'd found that he lost it he'd sin and he'd separated himself from God and was on this side of the chasm so he could not redeem it he just couldn't do it because he was needed he needed a redemption himself so he couldn't do it but the lamb stood up and he took the book of title and he took it from the right hand of him that set up on a throne to claim his redemptive to claim his rights to claim for me and you what he redeemed us from back to everything that Adam lost in the Garden of Eden he redeemed us back to that he redeemed us back to the half when Eve said I want to move that mountain out of the way because I can't see he redeemed you back to that and you have the authority and the right to speak to your Mountain he redeemed the lamb took the book that had your name on it saying I'm claiming these as mine they're mine they belong to me it's one thing for you to say I belong to God but when god almighty says you belong to me God's saying they belong to me I want you to search later on I want you to search revelations chapter 5 this is story they say this is symbolism of you but I want you to find Satan in that picture you're not gonna find him and you're only going to find the Redeem you're going to find the type of the bride you're going to find the 24 elders and you go find the lamb you're going to find a strong angel there but you will not find Satan in the picture in Revelation chapter 5 you can search it over you can look over and the lamb is saying that these belong to me they're rightfully mine and you have the authorities say what about that Satan you're not even in the picture no more you have accused me day in and day out what about it Satan I belong to God they thought I was worth dying for Satan what about it he thought I was worth getting beat over so that I could be healed what about it Satan you remember that brother Seth what about that Satan what about this precious blood what about his mercy what about his healing touch what about his deliverance you've been chosen you've been called you've been elected you belong in the land of the Holy Spirit he belong in the land of Revelation and you have been chosen to tear satan's kingdom down you know the military has a statement that there's no truer representation of a country than the people that it sends into the field to fight for it there's no truer representation of a country than the people that it sins to fight for it you were born to fight this battle you were born to win this battle you're a true representation of the country that you came from you see you see you have representation from predestination you see the things the reason why catches your attentions and it ain't catching a priest down the roads attention and why it's taking hold in your life is because you have representation there is no true representation of a country than the people they send to fight for it God must think a lot about you he sent you here to take over Laodicea not for Laodicea to take over you not for Laodicea to take over your prayer life for you to take your prayer life and take over Laodicea stop allowing Laodicea to slip in and tell you that you belong to Laodicea I don't belong to Laodicea I may come through Laodicea I may live in this Laodicean age but I don't belong to lay on us here I'm like Jeremiah there's fire shut up in my bones I don't belong to the devil and the devil don't belong to me that's what he's wrong about in this day is because it's being revealed to a people that they don't belong to a devil [Applause] will the devil don't like no praise and not around [Music] I've never no like no talking my revelations around here revelation beats the devil back and forth every which way from Sunday and it'll still beat him next Sunday until we leave this world this word would have feit Satan anytime anyplace anywhere Reina sign his own time God his own time hallelujah let's move on just a moment your God is fighting their battles for you I love listening to sister Elena butts testimony if she's telling that later she said it's God really fighting my battles I can't see him fighting my battles but God began to reveal to her that he's the LORD thy God that fighting your battles you may not see him fighting your battles but I want you to know he's fighting your battles he said he would not leave you comfortless it's in the cover to come by you he come to minister to your life he knows what you're going through he knows the pain of your past he knows everything you're going through he's the god that's fighting your battles I sent to the family this week of Isaiah 58 and eight that the Bible says that the glory of the Lord would go before you and the glory of the Lord would be your rear award that means that he's got your six and he's got your 12 God's got my front God's got my back we look over in the Bible in Genesis chapter 22 look up your seat belts we're gonna be much longer tonight when we see that where God made Abraham a promise after providing a sacrifice there that that RAM that was caught in the thicket that God made a promise to Abraham remember the promise remained until this day it does not falter right the vision and make it plain so that then that readeth may run with it the visions been made plain before you don't get caught up in the devil's details don't get caught up in this in is in his ideas of doubt and fear don't get caught up in those saying the vision has been made plain you just run with it he told that you is going to have a baby you run with that he told you that your seed was coming back run with it it's been made plain before you I didn't make it but Iran didn't make it the Bible the God of the Bible said it let the god that wrote the
