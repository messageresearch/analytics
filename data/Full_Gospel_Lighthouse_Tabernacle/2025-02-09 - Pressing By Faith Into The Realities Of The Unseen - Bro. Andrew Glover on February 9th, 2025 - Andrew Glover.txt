let's just bow our hearts for a word of prayer as his Pres presence is here as he's moving throughout the congregation preparing the hearts to receive his word how many just say Lord let that presence just linger near me let that presence just hang over my heart this morning and as your word Goes Forth may your presence may it deposit that word into my soul Heavenly Father Lord as the Believers have gathered here this morning Lord we're not gathered here out of ritual or tradition not gathered here out of form fashion oh God or to fulfill our religious duties but Lord we're here because there is a deep calling to the deep and Lord your Prophet has t us that before there could be a creation there had to be a Creator and Lord this morning before there was a desire in our heart to receive more of you or Lord to be in your presence or to feel your anointing Lord there had to be a presence and anointing already so Lord this morning every devil in hell has done everything they can to block these blessings Lord to hinder the visitation of your presence but Lord what a joy it is in our heart this morning to tell the Devil he's defeated he did not have enough to stop you and Lord if he didn't have enough to stop you he don't have enough to stop us for Lord we are a part of the Creator this morning and Lord as we Endeavor to look into your word your word Goes Forth Lord may it bring healing to sick bodies oh God lord as your word Goes Forth may it bring Deliverance to bound hearts and lives oh oh God lord if there be any questions here this morning Father may your word Minister the answer dear God lord if there be any Lord this morning they would be empty without the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire lord your word went forth there and while Peter yet spake the Holy

God lord sicknesses have to flee At The Mention Of The Name of Jesus Lord for those who are discouraged I pray that encouragement would come this morning Lord whatever the devil is trying to hang over the hearts of the Believers Lord may your anointing drive it away from them dear God Lord that we can leave this meeting today Lord transformed by your presence now father I pray a special blessing upon our brother Ron upon brother Andrew upon this assembly here dear God lord may you open the windows of heaven and Lord may you may you rain showers of blessings upon them oh god father we're asking your anointing be with us this morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the believer says amen and amen my what a what an atmosphere in the building this morning amen want to say God bless you all today we do count it a great honor and a privilege to be here with you once again and my we just thank the Lord for speaking to us last night and and then we just pray something was said to be a blessing to you and be a help and an encouragement and truly that's our only motive and objective amen is to be a blessing to God's people and want to say again brother Ron Brother Andrew we thank you all for this opportunity the invitation to be here and to speak to your congregation and we sure thank the Lord for brother Ron Brother Andrew and the ministry here and amen their um years of service to God's people how many appreciates the men of God Amen that are endeavoring to preach this message and amen we want to say we do appreciate brother Matt that been a friend of ours for many many years and amen I was just thinking this morning brother Matt uh amen he's not just a friend that'll be a friend with you in the good times but he'll be a friend with you in the bad times and Amen brother Matt's gotten the in the trenches with us and fall a few times and stood with us and we we sure love you brother Matt appreciate your ministry and your stand for this message and amen of course brother William we appreciate him and all the men of God here today and amen if you have your Bibles today we want to go to the word of the Lord amen we want to turn to the book of St Luke the 16th chapter the book of St Luke the 16th chap chapter and then we're going to read in Philippians 3 and 2 Corinthians 4 I've been in a bit of a a series at home speaking on the on some things and was going to take a part of that today and the Lord just changed our thought uh there last night so we just pray amen that this will be okay amen I I want to follow him Amen in St Luke chapter 16 and then Philippians 3 and if it be possible to put a little bit more in my ear and a little bit of the Lowe's and I'll control it on my side amen St Luke chapter 16 and verse 16 amen the law and the prophets were until John and since that time the kingdom of God is preached somebody say preached preached and every man presseth into it thank you that's good there the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth somebody say presseth PR presseth into it so according to Jesus there is a preaching of the Kingdom and there is also a pressing into what has been preached now in Philippians chapter 3 Philippians chapter 3 Paul there is writing in Philippians 3 Amen in verse number 13 Philippians 3 and verse number 13 and Paul here writing says Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind now listen and reaching forth unto those things which are before so Paul is not saying that there's not some things behind the church but he's telling you they're not worth going back to so leave them behind you and reach forth unto the things which are before now watch what he says he says I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so Jesus said the kingdom is preached and man press into it Paul here says forget those things that are behind you and press forward into the things that are before you let me ask you this how does a Believer press let's read let's turn to 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse number 13 and there I believe Paul will give us the answer to the question of how a Believer presses 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse number 13 again Paul writing he says now we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken now we also believe and therefore speak so a Believer presses by believing what has been spoken in The Same Spirit of faith that it was spoken in in other words when you begin to speak what you believe you begin to press against the enemy that is trying to stop you from going into the things that God has called you into verse number 18 Paul says this while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal somebody say Amen but the things which are not seen are Eternal amen we ask Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here today if I would take a title today I want to speak to you on this pressing by faith into the realities of the Unseen pressing by faith into the realities of the Unseen 1960 brother Bram preaches a very powerful sermon and he will title it the unfailing realities of the Living God the unfailing realities of the Living God and in that sermon brother brand will begin to speak about people amen that have received the Holy Ghost and he'll say this he says oh how many more that has received the Holy Ghost see he said it's begin to be a talk Among Us oh may it revive us to a spot that we'll go to searching and hungering and pulling for the realities of God may it revive us to a spot that we will go to hungering and pulling and searching amen for the realities of God I love this statement for God is a reality amen God is a reality how many believes this morning that God is a reality he's not just a figment of our imagination friends he's not just an idol that we look to in the time of trouble but our God is a reality again he will say this now the holy spirit amen will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another see it will make each person come into its character see amen because it's a spirit that leads you it brings or makes you subject to its nature now you don't bring it subject to your nature natur but it makes you subject to its nature and the Holy Spirit makes you live and love to do it oh how to give up the things of the world when the Holy Spirit comes in how it cleanses you and washes you and puts a desire in you to follow him and a thirst and a hunger amen for more of it just bathing yourself see amen he brings realities when the Holy Ghost comes into the soul of a man amen the Hol Holy Ghost brings reality another place what we need today is men and women who wants a reality hallelujah amen not a Creed a reality that's what the world needs today it's not Creeds and Fashions amen we need realities in God the world don't want it they don't want to accept it see amen but the church has to have it because God wants you to have it amen he's the god of realities amen I don't know about you but I'm thankful this morning for the message of the hour amen that has comeing this generation Amen to pull us away from the Creeds and the dogmas and the Traditions amen and to open our eyes up to the realities of the Living God now when you start looking here at this word press I love the definition it means to move or to cause Amen to move into a position of contact with someone or something by exerting continuous physical Force when you look there at that word reality amen the word reality means a thing that exists in fact having previously only existed in one's mind now let me say this we know amen that the most powerful force there is brother R said there's no more powerful force than God right amen there's no more powerful force than God but he also says that the greatest power Amen in the world is not the atomic bomb amen but it is a belief who is in contact with his maker see it changes the whole attitude it changes his mental it changes his habit it changes his body it changes his nature amen it changes everything so when a Believer comes in contact with his maker amen that contact brings a change amen but it also brings a reality now in 1946 brother 1949 brother preaching a sermon called I was not disob obedient to the heavenly vision and there he's preaching and he starts talking about the subject of Science and he said I was just thinking of how amen that science how they are taking the natural man how he's went into the research from the fall of the natural and what he has done see and how little the spiritual man has progressed in the kingdom of God he said I was thinking that the natural man went out at the Unseen of his ey and he pulled an adom down out of the sky and he split that adom into two and that destroys human life he said now if the natural man that knows nothing of God and cannot know nothing of God except he be converted then his soul becomes alive with the supernatural if he could do that in the natural realm amen then what ought the man of God to be doing he said friends the church is so far behind amen let's pray my that God will move his church up amen let's pray that God will move move his church up the natural man with the natural resources is getting greater results amen than people are that calls themselves Christians he said let's press into the Unseen amen let's press into the Unseen the blessings are yours amen they are there for you amen so a prophet identified where the blessings are that belongs to a Believer amen the blessings are not in the scene amen but whether the blessings are in the Unseen he said it like this we have blundered in science enough Amen to wake us up amen two realities listen the way that God moves his church amen is by revealing his word to them and then they begin to believe the word that's being revealed and as they begin to believe that word they begin to press against the enemy and they begin to move into a position of contact with god listen I don't know about you amen but I really don't care about a social contact I don't care about a social network I don't care amen about getting a bunch of preachers together and trying to come up with the best idea I just want to come in contact with God I just want to know him for myself amen I want to know him in the power of his resurrection I want to know him in the fellowship of his suffering listen I want to know what God Amen that at midnight I can call on his name I want to know a God that when everything is falling apart amen I can call on him listen friends we need more than a contact with a preacher we need more than contact with our friends we need more than contact with the church we need to come in contact with God and stay in fellowship with god listen I don't think we ought to just have communion once a year amen or twice a year amen I think we ought to have communion every second of Our Lives you say well I'm not talking about the natural communion amen I'm talking about a spiritual communion where our souls are in fellowship with God and we are not looking at the things we see amen but we are looking at the things we don't see now brother B preaches that about three times and he'll say this in 1950 he said now we look at the Unseen and believe those things which are unseen amen but spoke of by God Amen become realities I wish I had two hours on that close we believe the things that are spoke of by God Amen and they become come realities whenever God speaks something if he can find somebody to believe it amen the one who believes it it will become a reality to them oh Church of the Living God Amen if you will begin to believe the promises of God they will become a reality to you in Matthew Chapter 2 the Bible speaks of three mag eyes and the prophet picks this up and he says isn't it strange that these stars were exactly in line for three men and nobody else saw it see amen now you can be so in line with the scripture that when those stars become in unity amen United themselves together in this constellation amen three men were also United at the same time and you can be so United with God Amen in his word until these things become realities you can see them and you can know know that they are true listen it is not for the world this message is not for the world Amen this message is for the elect of God that was predestinated from before the foundation of the world somebody say well I don't know if we should believe this or not amen because it's not commonly believed among the world Amen listen there's a lot of things in this Bible that is not commonly believed among the world Amen but we are in the world but we are not of the world Amen we are in Le of see but we are not of Le amen God who is rich in Mercy has allowed the word amen to come over our hearts and we have come in one Accord with this word therefore we believe things that are strange listen I know it's strange amen but I believe God calls a man to Salvation before he's ever born I know it's strange but I believe there's a people on the Earth that can no more die than God can I know it's strange but I believe there's a people whose names is in the Lamb's Book of Life and they were put there from before the foundation of the world and you can't make enough mistakes Amen to wipe your name out of the Lamb's Book of Life I believe that there is a power amen that will take a dead man and raising back to life again I believe there's a people who are not going to a grave but they're going to experience a translation I know it is a strange thing but I am a peculiar believer because I'm United with God and His word somebody say well these things aren't believed in the Baptist Church well this ain't the Baptist Church come on Church somebody say well my Pentecostal friends don't believe that this ain't a Pentecostal Church it is the word birth bride now somebody say well these things are impossible but as I said last night you have been born to believe the impossible brother said the impossible things are made real when God is took at his word amen The Impossible is made realities when God is taken at his word when you take God at his word you are taking the infallible God at the infallible spoken word he said see if this audience tonight could only get settled in their mind of who said this and what this really is this spoken word we would not need any healing service not need any salvation altar called it would all be finished if you just realized amen what that word was amen now come on church amen you know certain people say things and depending on who they are amen determines how much stock amen you put in what said amen if somebody sitting down at the coffee shop amen says we're going to war amen well you'll laugh at him and going about your business amen but let the president stand up and say we're going to war amen it makes a difference amen but because of who saying it oh Church of the Living God listen this message was not spoke by a preacher it was not spoke by Theologian but the same Pillar of Fire that met Mark and Luke and John met William brandom and he said these things may I say it as plain as I know how this is not the words of a Preacher this is the words of God and if you can believe it's God if you can believe God spoke it then you ought to get your sword in your hand you ought to get your feet shot with the preparation of the Gospel you ought to put on the helmet of salvation we're going to war hey we're going to war and we're not leaving anything behind everything God has promised us we are the possessors of the promises of God because we have faith in the one who has spoke it I love what brother B says he says before it could be a word spoken amen it has to be a thought thank you buddy it has to be thought because a word is a thought manifest when God speaks he said now that's the way God did back in the beginning when God looked down to the corridors of heaven and saw all the things that were going to happen on the earth did you ever just say and draw a picture out in your mind now that's the way God did perhaps in the beginning but then it seemed good to him so he spoke it and as soon as it was spoken it became a word word see the thought was expressed in a word now listen once God expresses his thought and makes it a word he can never take it back oh Hallelujah when God's thought becomes a word he could never take it back before the foundation of the world Jesus was already slain the Bible said he was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world how was he slain the very minute God spoke the word it was settled forever the seed was planted and it had to come to pass because he can not speak anything amen but the unadulterated truth so when God's thought amen crosses his lips as a word it has now become a spoken word and it can never be taken back when it was thoroughly paid by Jesus Christ and you accepted it listen and as long as God accepted Christ he accepted you with Christ and when did he do it amen before the foundation of the world when he spoke him into existence listen he spoke you redeemed with him oh Church of the Living God somebody say well I'm going to take your Redemption well if you're going to take my Redemption you've got to take away Jesus's Redemption because the same time that he received his Redemption was the same time I received my Redemption you say what do you mean amen he was the Lamb of God slain for the sins of the world to redeem the Fallen race of Adam listen church this is more than just a church it is more than just a group of religious people but you are the spoken word seed bride you have come from the thoughts of God spoke by God into manifestation let me say it as plain as I know how we are a two-fold being friends we have an outward man but we also have an inward man man and the prophet of God said the outward man looks by his eyes but the inward man walks by faith the outside man is self amen but the inward man is God the outside man is self amen but the inward man is God you do not see with our eyes though many times we thought we see with our eyes amen we only look with our eyes amen but we see with her heart listen if you're going to see more than your Humanity if you're going to see more than your mistakes if you're going to see more than your faults and shortcomings you've got to quit seeing with your eyes and you got to start looking with your heart listen this message didn't come Amen to turn our eyes it came to turn our hearts because if we can ever start looking from our hearts we will look at things different than the way we look at them with our eyes oh Christians pinch that Inside Man now and wake him up to the reality that Jesus Christ is here Amen to manif EST himself to you I love this what a prophet says amen he says we all have to work together as one unit we have to get our differences away and lay aside our doctrines and things and put our arms together and press forward Amen to take the promise that God Almighty has given us I'll just say it as plain as I know how amen the time has come amen for the Believers to press but it's time to press forward listen it's time to stop worrying it's time to stop Fring it's time to stop trying to go back and redo and undo and change there has got to come a time that you've got to accept this in your heart I was not born for this world I was not born for Leota I have come from God and I'm going back to God and I've got to forget the past and I've got to start looking at the Unseen and believing the things that God spoke will become realities listen we're here and we're under a divine commission amen it's a Divine commission to possess amen the promises of God remember said a man that's commissioned of God that man looks upward and onward you don't care what the world says about it anyhow amen he's not listening to the world he's got a Divine commission from God and he is enjoying the presence of the Holy Ghost let me say this the Holy Ghost is among the church and the Holy Ghost is here amen he's doing more than just making us feel good he's doing more than just making us shout or dance or or speak in tongues or see Visions the Holy Ghost is here and he's making us perseverant he's making us perseverance you say what does perseverant mean it means to be persistent to make a goal and the pr of God said I believe every Christian therefore amen should be very perseverant he said be perseverant and press towards the mark of the High Calling amen very persistent in their claims to God let me say this we're not just pressing against thin air we're not just pressing amen against the atmosphere of this service amen but we are pressing toward something which means there's something between us and what we're pressing to that don't want us to get there but a prophet of God said forget those things that are in the past now amen and press towards the mark of the High Calling listen to the complete identification all time will fade out into eternity when Jesus comes listen friends we are not here Amen to press Amen to a partial identification we are here Amen to press into the complete identification of what this word bride is going to be is it okay to say what a prophet said he said justification made amen I know it is it's just a habit so it's okay amen just preaching justification made way relax justification made way for sanctification and sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the word itself come come down in the church in its Perfection let me say this to you friends we are not just Justified Christians we're not just Sanctified Christians we're not even just Holy Ghost filled Christians we are word born believers who have gone beyond the feelings we have gone beyond the sensation we have gone beyond the emotions listen we believe in the gifts but we ain't following the gifts we believe in justification but we ain't still smoking a pipe we have climbed all the way to the top of the pyramid when the Capstone has descended as the headship to this body that's why the devil hates you it's because he knows you have got a seed on the inside of you that is ordained to go all the way he's not trying to stop you because you come to for Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle he's not trying to stop you amen because brother Ron is your pastor he's not trying to stop you because of what kind of family you come out of he's trying to stop you because he knows there is something on the inside of you that is greater than anything he can throw against you Hallelujah he knows there is a seed on the inside of your soul that has the ability Amen to shake off the past and to remember there is a future we're not going to have a rearview mirror Affair a rearview mirror only looks back and sees where you been but we're looking forward Amen to see where we are going then where are we going church we are pressing into the Fulfillment of scriptural promises that were made for the age that we're living in you said brother Andrew how am I going to advance well can I say this sometimes and just going real simple you know these things but sometimes the only way you can advance is you got to press am right I know what I'm talking about and you do too cuz I can see it on some of you that's the only reason you're still here today is you've had to press you've had to press through some disappointments you've had to press through some bad days you've had to press through some let Downs you've had to press through some unbelief you've had to press through some doubts you've had to press through some lies you've had to press through some criticism you've had to press through some negativity you've had to press through amen people saying all kinds of things about you you've had to press through amen people question what you believe you've had to press through ridicule but can I say this to you but we're here hey we're here this morning and we're not half-hearted and we're not just lukewarm and we're not just sitting around waiting on somebody Amen to get happy so maybe we can get happy there is a seed on the inside of us and it was spoke by God and the revelation of the things of our future shall become a reality and the devil can't stop it and hell can't bind it and the Demons of hell can't scare it we know who we are sometimes if you're going to advance you're going to have to press amen the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it you know what that word prth means it means to use and apply Force so sometimes you're going to have to get mad at that devil and you're going to have to use some force and apply some pressure and do what Paul said he said thou therefore run not as un certainly so f i and am men not as one that beateth the air can I say this we are not fighting flesh and blood but we are fighting spirits and wickedness and principalities and rulers of darkness in high places but brother Bram comes along and he preaches a sermon called desperation and he uses Luke 16 and he said see every man presses into it not just simply walks into it but it's got to be pressed into now let me say what he said here he said the law and the prophets were until John and since that time amen the Kingdom of Heaven has been preached and Men press into it you don't just stand around and say pick me up by the collar Lord and push me in you press into it see you get desperate it's between life and death now when brother preaches desperation listen at his opening prayer he said I want to speak tonight on giving them courage courage to encourage them amen to take that god-given right they have a right to defeat that devil he is already defeated and he is just bluffing them but I'm claiming them Father he said now help me Amen to speak the word and you speak through me with this few notes I got wrote down here and little scriptures wrote out he said I pray that you'll help me Lord and get in the word and give them faith for the glory of God so our faith to defeat the Devil comes through the preaching of the word of God that's why Paul said that faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen amen for by faith the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the world were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear listen to the prophet he said now you testify of the things you do not see you don't testify of what you see amen you testify of what you don't see because faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of things you do not see amen and we look at the Unseen somebody say well amen the doctor said well we can see the doctor's report we can see the scans we can see the blood work we can see all the issues amen but listen that's not what we talk about we talk about the things we don't see let me say this amen you say well my kid is running from God we can see the tattoos we can see the chains we can see the unbelief we can see the path are going down but that's not what we testify about we testify about the things we don't see I don't talk about how bad they are I talk about how good of a service we're going to have when they come back to church I don't talk about how awful and how bound they are I talk about how they're going to shout the house down in the liberty of Jesus Christ I'm not talking about temporary things I am talking about eternal things that are not seen amen but they are real listen and God didn't say the tattoos were real but he said the blood was real he didn't say the sin was real he said but the blood was real you know what I say I say the blood is bigger and the blood is greater and the blood is stronger and the blood is richer and the blood is more powerful than any devil you can see any Spirit you can feel any evil thing that tries to come upon you yes sir we do not testify of the things we see we testify of the things we don't see because faith is Supernatural and it does Supernatural things he said then he will give to you Supernatural Faith which is spiritual Faith then that spiritual Faith amen recognizes only the word no matter what anybody else says it don't do no good it only knows the word another place he said faith is something that you have to believe it's there that really nothing else will declare it's there but Faith another place what is Faith it's an unseen fory it's a spirit and the Holy Spirit brings Faith door to the heart 58 oh you claim you got faith but you know when Jesus becomes the Lord of your faith then all his words become real to you when Jesus becomes the Lord of your faith then all of his words become real to you when God takes the Holy Spirit and brings that word to you and makes it alive to you a reality that your faith it'll stand up and claim it you don't have to feel nothing you don't have to see nothing or nothing but you do have to believe something somebody say well we got to be careful just going off on believing no I think that's what the bride's called to do is not only feel something only see something she's called to believe something come on church we might as well let the rubber hit the road we're humans here this morning and if we'll really be honest with ourselves there have been days we did not feel God we did not feel saved we did not feel like the bride we did not feel like we was going in a Rapture amen but why are we still here after all those bad days that we didn't feel like it because down on the depths of our soul was a genan seed of God and the seed don't go by feelings the seed don't go by sensation the seed goes by faith and the faith seed in my heart believes God when I'm on the mountain and it believes God when I'm in the Valley when everybody's with me it believes when everybody's again me it believes when everybody's shouting it believes when everybody's pouting it believes come come on Church we're not a bunch of fleshly Christians that only has a Revival when the music is going listen you all are warriors and you've learned how to combat this devil you've learned how to fight against this devil can I say something to you don't lay down now don't you lay down now don't you lay down and bow your knee to them feelings them feelings didn't come from God come on but you did you don't have to feel nothing see nothing but you do have to believe something now what is fa I hope that's okay what is Faith it's the evidence of things you do not see see by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet he moved with fear and he prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became the heir of the righteousness which is by faith so when Noah didn't feel like that Ark was really going to work he kept on building it you know why because he was moved brother Jimmy was moved by faith I got to look in the Amplified Bible and I love the translation there of that phrase Things Not Seen in the Amplified Bible it means events not yet seen events not yet seen now I'm sorry amen but I'm the one that says Where oh that's right modern events are made clear by the prophecy listen friends we are believers who do not wait for the manifestation to believe the prophecy we believe the prophecy therefore we know there'll be a manifestation it's like it's like the other day I was out in California and there was a brother there and he said hey he said you want to see a you want to see a a driverless car he said we get on our phones we punch the buttons in the car comes down picks us up sure enough there went one right there nobody in it nobody driving it amen a bunch of techn ology amen that brother said man he said you want to try it I said well I guess it'll be okay amen and and no offense to brother but he is a little excited about it you know and finally he asked me we was walking down the road he said brother Andrew aren't you excited about it amen don't you know what brother B said and there it is you know what I said I said brother I've been excited since I was a boy and heard the prophecy listen I do not wait to see the manifestation to get excited when I hear the prophecy I I judge who it's coming from and I know he never said nothing that didn't come to pass so I put my shouting shoes on I get a harp off the willow tree I get a tambourine in my hand because I know if he said it come hell or high water it's going to come to pass because I know in who miss pooke it listen I've heard people say things that didn't a bit more come to pass than nothing but when you hear brother brandom say anything you can put everything you got on it it's going to happen it don't matter how many counsel of preachers try to stop it God is able these stones to rise children un Abraham yes sir we do not wait for the event to shout we shout on the prophecy now I've heard some prophecies you couldn't shout on but we are the bride and we believe this message therefore we Shout what a prophet said I I I'm I'm feeling good is that okay amen I there a brother one time he got got away from God you know and he played a certain instrument in the church and he really played this instrument and you know what he he got away from God and there was a brother come through one day and he he got and he said Lord I say unto thee that that young man's going to come back and play that instrument he going to come back play that instrument don't you worry he's going to come back and play that instrument and so everybody believed that you know what I believe belied it right it's what you do you believe right so one day somebody come in there and they said hey they said let's sell the organ you know he played an organ said let's sell that let's sell that organ and they said no no we can't sell that organ said that brother's going to come back and play it you know and I said well I said amen we believe it you know so a few years went by and one day somebody got up and everybody's real depressed in the service brother I mean they real down you know and they got up and they said they said well we might as well sell the organ said that brother that they said was going to come back and play it said he's moved about 10 hours away and he'll never come back and play it and you know what I did I'm sorry I just and said well glory to God you know amen and somebody come to have service they said why did you get excited about that I said because it's going to be a greater Miracle listen if we really believe it then we don't have to sell it no matter how I don't care if it goes to 10 Buck two if it come from God he's going to come back and play it well come on church I know some of these things brother BR said looks impossible hey I ain't backing off of it cuzz I know who said it I know it looks impossible that our loved ones are going to rage some morning but brother Santa I don't care how impossible it looks because I come from the lineage of Noah and I believe when it looks ridiculous to believe because I know who said it come on Church come on Amen somebody say well amen Noah must have been been bold Noah was an heir of righteousness by faith before there was a cloud before there was a drop of water Noah with the Unseen of the natural eye with his spiritual eye he tuned it to the word of God and he seen the rain falling oh he said what this church is in tune what if the people here tonight that's sick would begin to think God is God and if he isn't then why serve him if he's still God he's still a Healer if he's almighty God he can do all things and if he made a promise then he cannot break it he has to keep it then that pulsation begins to rise in your heart amen something is going to take place there could be nothing stop it it's a fire like a building on fire on the windy day and it just keeps blowing as the Holy Spirit fans the fire listen and it keeps on burning until it becomes a reality to you woo glory to God hey can I say it to you it keeps on burning until it becomes a reality to you amen can I borrow you for a second brother Ron I'm I'm not have to get up amen I just want to use your testimony I remember as a little boy amen hearing about brother Ron being in the fire I remember hearing all the reports and amen the caringbridge.com and all those pictures I remember I was just a kid but I followed it very closely amen I watched all the progress and I remember when they got up and said he's brain dead and his his organs have got to be harvested and all these things I remember that amen but then I remember Amen brother bcll saying but he's going to preach the next year at the Winter Camp I remember that amen listen when God spoke that to brother brother Ed amen it wasn't real to brother Ron he didn't even know what was going on but I remember as a little boy sitting in my grandmother's house a been watching him stand there on a Saturday night and preaching that meeting and say what you've been praying about what you've been looking for is standing before you tonight listen what happened was the Holy Ghost spoke that word and the Holy Ghost kept Fanning the Flames until brother Ron become the reality of what God spoke to brother is bisco oh Church of the Living God you say how can you believe that because I see it I see the manifestation of somebody listen he didn't feel like preaching when it come he didn't feel like shouting when it come but in his soul he believed God was able and sister Connie believed God was a what are you saying I'm saying if it'll work for a man in a natural fire then what about the Church of the Living God I think it's time to get off your pity party I think it's time to get off of who hurt me and who offended me listen if I worried about all that I'd still be sitting in the woods somewhere in Tennessee hunting this morning but God who is rich in Mercy deliver this old country boy and give me a reality this ain't about a bunch of preachers it ain't about a bunch of churches it's about somebody believing God is able to do anything that he said he could do in the face of every devil trying to stop it when I don't feel it I believe it when I don't see it I believe it because I come from Noah now when you can't see it it's still real when you can't feel it it's still real my goodness how I'm just feeling too good right now I wonder how all the devils in Hell must have felt when the Lord spoke to brother Ed and brother Ron in that condition and then the devil had to sit there and watch him stay into the reality of what he had tried to stop I'm feeling too good right now buddy hallelujah what did the devil feel like when he had to take a sideline and say I tried to stop that but I couldn't I tried to stop this from happening but I couldn't I tried to kill him but I couldn't I tried to make him doubt but I couldn't I tried to make brother Ed be afraid because what he said but I couldn't you know why because it wasn't coming from a gift or a man it was coming from God oh may I say it to you amen the same devil had to step back and say I couldn't stop it well I want to tell that devil pull you up another seat on the sidelines cuz youve tried to stop me youve tried to block me youve tried to hinder me but one of these mornings I'm going to step into the reality of a body change throw everything you got against us devil we'll pick it up and throw it back I'm going on with Jesus just the same you can talk about me you can scandalize my name but you're going to have to watch me you're going to have to watch me step into the reality of what I believe I'm sure we get to see it in the lot these things begin to shape up listen then healing the body doesn't become a fiction it becomes a reality the baptism of the Holy Spirit doesn't become an emotional worked up substance it becomes a reality of the indwelling presence of the Lord Jesus Christ he's always with you whether you feel him or not whether you see him or not he's there I remember as a young Preacher Brother brother Sean Mart helped me so much on that point he always told me he said brother Andrew the angel the Lord accompanies the message always he said just preach the message well can I say this to you I do not have to worry about whether he's here or not whether I feel him or not whether I see him or not I know he's here somebody say how do you know he's here because I see the evidence he's been here brother Chris I don't have to go look in the book I don't have to go reading the magazine I can see the evidence come on church amen somebody say well is it rained amen well you know what you can do you can get your book and you can see in the book if it said it was going to rain you can get on the internet and check the forecast and see if it said it was going to rain you can call your friend up and say hey did it rain but you know the best way Amen to know if it's rain is to go outside and look and see if the flowers are wet and the grass is wet and the con Creed is wet you know what that wetness is it's an Evidence it's rained I don't have to ask somebody if it's rained I can see the evidence of the rain oh church of living God I don't have to ask somebody is the pillar of fire here this morning I see the evidence of the pillar of fire as it's whirling across this building I see it on you I see it on the pit listen I believe it because it was spoke by God therefore we preach the word of faith and as we preach the word of faith it actually pulls you into an atmosphere to believe what you can't see what you can't feel what you can't hear what you can't touch what you can't sense what you can't remember what you can't reason as the word of faith is preached brother actually pulls you into an atmosphere to believe it that's why the devil hates the preaching of the word I have never fought to stay awake during the song service I have never fault to stay awake during the specials but you know as well as I know there have been some times you fought to stay awake you know why because the devil knows when you begin to believe he begins to lose the devil knows when you begin to believe what you're hearing he begins to lose what are you saying I'm saying you want to whip the devil right now start believing you want to whip that lust start believing you want to whip at pornography start believing you want to whip at depression then start believing you want to whip that nervous anxiety devil that has plagued you pled your family pled your home PL your churches PL your life PL your grandma herma you know what I say I say start believing the word that God Is Bigger and God is greater and God is stronger and God is able right here right now to give you a victory in the house of God like you have never seen before as you begin to believe he begins to lose as you begin to worship he begins to back up as you begin to say yes Lord I believe you Lord that devil begins to realize there's somebody that believes now think about this that's the reason he says I will not talate with any Creed or any denominations because I have been commissioned of God to stay with the word another place I love to see God heal his children certainly don't get me wrong but one reason I've been noticing if you notice lately I've been trying everywhere I go when I get an invitation is press in to preach just a little bit I've let down on my preaching and it's putting too much on just the anointing and the working on the Eternal part of the supernatural rather that when to see the Visions they're wonderful and I thank God for it but yet the preaching of the word is a million miles beyond that on now brother sister that's a heavy one that the preaching of the word is a million miles Beyond division it's a million miles Beyond just the ability to see something in the Supernatural realm and relate it to the people the preach now I can prove that to you because brother said people can see things and it be nothing but Illusions and he said what will happen is it really is an illusion but you'll imagine it something spiritual and he said you'll continue to imagine it till you really believe it listen and it will become a reality to you now I'm on something can I preach a second there's people that get in their minds that somebody don't like them they get in their mind that somebody's against them and somebody's out to get them and they get that in their mind and they start living under a victim mentality and they start imagining so and so don't like me and brother Ron must not like me cuz it's been three Sundays since he shook my hand and brother and must not like me cuzz he looked right past me and brother William he must not like me cuz he took up the offering and didn't smile at me when he took my dollar well maybe give some more no I'm just kidding it's a joke that's on the internet it'll be all over the world give what you can God will bless you getting too serious in here well I tell you brother Ron was preaching and he looked across the crowd he looked at everybody but me and you know what happens you start imagining you start believing that M can I say this and it becomes a reality to you but then people get mad cuz it don't become a reality to nobody else well you know why it don't become a reality to nobody else cause it ain't real to nobody but you you have imagined it so long it's become real to you and people quit church because things become real to them it's not real to nobody else in the entire assembly woo glory to God somebody shout hallelujah you know what I say I say it's time to quit imagining and start believing we don't have to imagine God loves us we know he loves us we don't have to imagine God saved us we know he saved us listen I don't have I thank God I don't believe something brother on that I got to stand on an island by myself and [Applause] believe it becomes real to you can I preach and because it's not real to nobody else then people start trying to make it real to somebody else they concoct a bunch of things together and present this and it's nothing but imaginations come on people walk off and say ain't nobody in that church loves me I'll tell you what I think you are I think you're a liar because until you've asked everybody from God to the least of infant child if they love you then you're lying woo I guess it's just the evangels coming out you're lying you say well brother Andrew I asked the Elder and I asked the youngest well let me tell you this have you forgot who's always in the church that's the Lord Jesus Christ I don't care if the Elder don't love me I don't care if the baby thrs up every time he sees me if Jesus Christ the son of God is in the house of God then I don't care if everybody's against me I know there's one in there that loves me and greater is he that is with me than the Devils that's against me get up and get off your pity party and quit imagining things and start believing the word of God and pressing against those spirits come on somebody we ain't got to imagine we're going in the Rapture I know I'm going in the Rapture the success of this church he says it lies within the preaching of the Gospel of the power of God and the demonstration of the spirit therefore he sent anointed preachers to preach the word and you received it another place Christ does not anoint ministers to preach the gospel just to have it return back to him void but he expects you to receive the word can I read the rest of it and in receiving the word be ready I got to thinking about that one day brother Ron in receiving the word be ready ready for what ready for the results that the word produces can I say something to you we are living in an age where as you receive the word you become the word we are living in a season brother Andrew when you can read a prayer request and at the end of the service it can already be a testimony I've seen it happen I have seen it happen where a prayer request becomes a testimony in the middle of a service I was preaching one time down in Georgia right there in the middle of covid you know and everybody was scared to death to do anything besides Brea you and somebody even scared to do that amen right there in the middle of that and we was having a meeting however they felt led God bless them we was having a meeting right there and all of a sudden a prayer requests come in right before I got to preach pray for baby so and so in the hospital they think it's co 104 fever so we prayed and I got up and got to preaching and you ever been there brothers You're Just preaching and you feel that thing hanging over the congregation and I'm preaching away knowing what I'm working against and while I'm preaching all of a sudden brother Jim somebody walks up there and slips a note on the pull pit and I picked up the note and I read it and I said well glory to God I said here's what the note says the baby we prayed for the temperature just broke and they're releasing it from the hospital the co test is negative you know what I watched I watched the power of God drop right in that service and somebody sitting on the front row jumped up on their feet and took off running up and down the aisles praising God you say preacher why because we're living in the season Church where if we just keep believing and we just keep pressing and we just keep walking something's going to change as you receive the word you become the word listen friends the Bible said we'll cast out Devils we'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover somebody say why are you so strong on the preaching of the Gospel of the message of the hour because the preaching of the Gospel is the casting out of the devil he said God give me the authority to break the power of Satan another place you give us the divine power Amen to break the power of Satan over this life in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ somebody say this with me over this life notice he did not say in this life over now what I'm going to say to you might help you if you listen to me quit letting the devil tell you you're possessed you're not possessed you're oppressed amen and there is a big difference between possession and oppression when you are demon possessed that mean oh God I'm feeling good that means the devil's got you but when you're demon oppressed that means he's trying to get you can I say it to you the devil says I'm going to get you I'm going to get you I'm going to get you I'm going to get you I'm going to get you you know what I say I say you should have got me when you could have got me but you can't get me now cuz God done got me W glory to God if you was going to get me devil you should have done got me when you could get me because God already got me and he didn't get me for a good service he didn't get me for a youth camp he got me for the Rapture he got me for the change of my body if the devil was going to get you brother Ronnie should have done got you if he was going to get you he would have already done it but go ahead and put your foot on that devil this morning and tell him devil if you was going to get me you would have already done it but I'm still here wo I'm still here I'm still in the fight that means you might be oppressing me but you ain't possessed me Hallelujah I know in whom I have believed W the spirit hung over me a devil saying wait a little while longer that's the devil listen the only thing that keeps you from being well this morning is a spirit hanging over you that won't fully let you go out yonder and believe God's promise that he's already done it did I read that right already done it that's what God gave me he gave every gospel preacher who will believe him the power and authority to break that Spirit say this with me very plain it is is a spirit a spirit some of y'all just got a victory you've been waiting for for 10 years it is a spirit when you recognize it's a spirit that'll make you turn every gun you got loose when you recognize it's a spirit you will quit fighting carefully glory to God you say what do you mean I mean this Spirits are real and Spirits get on precious people and somebody says well you after this person you after that sister no I'm after that spirit and you know to know why I don't care about slinging a sword it's cuz I ain't worried about hurting you I'm worried about hurting that Spirit that's trying to kill you well I might as well preach I'm feeling this good and I drove all the way out here amen I tell you what it's time to do it's time to quit praying that brother Andrew or brother Ron or any of these preachers come out here with kids gloves on to preach to you well don't hurt my feelings and don't step on my pets don't do this you know what I say I say you ought to lay before God and say God if you got to melt the gloves off of their hand let them come out there and suck the hide off of this devil I Want to Be Free of it and the minute you're ready to be free is the minute you will quit fearing hard preaching the minute you're ready for it to really be gone is the minute you'll quit being afraid that brother Andrew is going to say something too strong or brother Ron's going to step on it too hard you'll say brother Ron if you got to get on a bulldozzer and doze the kingdom of hell down doze it down I want to go in the Rapture I am tired of this [Applause] Spirit they gave me my Liberty we get back to preaching the message we could kick Dr Dobson out of our message [Applause] churches well I got them behind me I don't care if ever devil in Hell's again me I know where I'm standing if we'd get back to preaching the Holy Ghost and quit trying to make warm fuzzy atmospheres and talk a bunch of devils down you ain't never going to talk this devil down and you ain't never going to reverse psychology on this devil there's only one thing this devil must do that's die that devil must die and the only way that Devil's going to die is not by a couch and a shrink sitting on the other side it's going to take the power of the Holy Ghost and Fire to remove that Spirit from controlling your life I know they get mad at me and say everything they want but I'm going to say it as plain as I know how away with psychology and bring back the Holy Ghost it worked 20 years [Applause] ago brother I'm just getting too free it used to work 20 years ago but you know what happened is a bunch of uncalled men in invaded pull pits and didn't have the anointing to stand there and war with them Devils so they had to resort to something so instead of going the Pres to the pillar of fire and meeting God for themselves they went got on some website and got some psychology certificate you know what I say I say it can work in a hospital it can work in a doctor's office but for the love of God and the sake of his people leave it out of the Church of the Living [Applause] God somebody let that devil out of here we believe in the power of the Holy Ghost and you know what I say I say God bless every man that does somebody say ouch well I'm this close to it prayer line one night brother on a Spirit come up on a person said brother I've tried and tried and tried I'm going get in trouble but told the pastor I've tried and tried and tried and I've prayed and prayed and you've prayed and prayed and and it's a spirit and it's it's really controlling me and with these eyes with these own eyes andw brother Andrew I saw it come with me come with me let's go back here and let's talk about it what makes you feel this way well that kind of voice what makes you feel this way what makes these things come upon you I was like a race horse in the Kentucky kby God let me have a chance at that devil let me have a chance at that devil this is a precious Soul we ain't worried about how that devil feels we ain't worried about what makes that Spirit trip its head we want to see that devil gone you know what I say I say take the sword out of the sheath and get out of this nonsense and get back on the front lines and do war with these Devils our young people sitting in prisons and marriages on the rocks and we're trying to bring separation and healings and all kinds of nonsense get back to the message of the hour and stand on a rock if you got to stand there I say God I pray for every mom and daddy in this building I pray for every marriage in this building I pray that when your babies see that marriage on the Rocks they see struggles and issues I pray they don't see Dr Dobson's book on the coffee table I pray they see a message book I pray they see you down around the altar praying and saying God the devil is trying to break up our home and trying to destroy our marriage but you are greater Lord send down the fire send down the anointing Lord call me oldfashioned call me what you want to but leave me alone I'm free I'm free to believe God I know I'm going a little bit over it but can I have a few minutes here this message this message puts marriages back together puts them back together Deacon told me one time he said there was a he was in a church and they got this psychology nonsense and said all their deacons and preachers and y'all y'all forgive me I know I'm on your platform but I'm getting a little free here yeah right I know that I guess that's why I'm free cuz ain't going to be we need to see you after service meeting feeding me that sounds a lot better than see me amen now listen here Brothers if you all don't go out here and get this psychology certificate you ain't got no business counsel anybody and until you get it you can't fix nothing in the church but there was one Elijah I said there was one Elijah and God bless this soul that said I will not go get that and I will not quit helping people this Church who elected me to this office so there come a time there was a family on the having trouble and little girl said if I can call brother so so I'd call his name but I don't want you for his sake right now said I'll call brother so and so and said I'll come over the brother told me he said I was sitting there reading a brother Brandon book and he said I got a phone call and he said this little girl said Mom and Daddy's fighting said they're against each other said can you please come over here said all the other deacons have come all the other issues ministers have come in debt with it nothing's changing he said I'll be right over there honey he said just give me a second he said I went to lay that book down he said something told me to take it with me he said I walked in that house and he said the spirits were raging he said they were fuming and feuding and fussing and carrying on he said the most God Godly cold feeling in that house he said I brought them all around the table and I sat down with that message book and I just started reading some quotes to him and started telling about what a prophet said how he said there's a spirit behind everything and how you got to recognize the devil and every one of his tactics he said in just a few moments as clear as I'm talking to to you he said there was like a whoosh went out of the room and he said there was a presence of God come in that room and I'm going to say the rest of the testimony and just say this and they're still together today it works the Holy Ghost works with every Power in me right now I believe every demon parents in here this minute is all broken can I say this to you it's time to go forward it's time to put on your walking shoes somebody say what kind of shoes do you wear to church well I wear walking shoes I've never went hunting and wore sandals and I never went golfing and work out well I've never been golfing period I never I never played baseball in cowboy boots because you wear the shoe that's fitting for the activity that you're fishing to do somebody say why do you wear walking shoes to the house of God because I know when the word is preached I'm going to walk right out of the situation when the word of God is preached I'm going to walk C out of the fear I'm going to walk right out now the [Applause] scare let me let me bring this to this somebody say it's time to press and it's time to walk it's time to walk Footprints means possession so just keep walking walking pressing on and every time you make a step in the kingdom of God that's yours and all things are possible that's given and all things that are given are possible but it's a battle so Spirits are coming in and you can't have it and you can't get it and you can't possess it can I say this to you them Spirits are liars and a prophet said I believe right now every demon power in this building is already broken it's all already broken well are you tired of it if you're tired of it put your walking shoes on and walk away from it somebody say how do you diffuse a situation I just walk away from it I felt good how do you diffuse an argument with the devil I just walk away from the devil because I know who I am and I'm not going to stand there and argue with the devil about what rights I have as a child of God can I say this to you it's time to walk I'm going to I'm going to close on this I am going to give you a portion of that three-part series back at New Year's I was flying from Florida up to up to uh and y'all forgive me i' I've been all over the place but I'm just following him this morning flying up to Geor uh Georgia from Florida for a New Year's meeting and sitting there on the plane I'm on my computer reading and listening to a tape going over some notes all of a sudden I hear brother brother brandom say this he said now here he said here's my New Year's message to you all Shalom and I said my what a powerful New Year's message and brother Ruben I just closed my computer and bowed my head right there on the plane and I said Lord I said I'm going tonight to speak to your people I said if I would go and speak to him tonight on this new year service going into a new year I said Lord what would be my New Year's message I said Lord and just just as plain as I'm talking to you I said 'lord I said ould you give me a New Year's message it's plain as I'm speaking to you right now brother Spirit of the Lord spoke in my heart and said these words said go tell my people just keep walking I said Lord you know how his preachers do sometimes Lord they've heard that a thousand times but as clear as I'm just praying right here in this in this plane Spirit of the Lord spoke back to my heart and said just keep walking I said okay Lord I Surrender I said now Lord if you told me something I'm going to find it in this message and I got on my on my tablet there and I started researching those words in the message just keep walking and I was reading where brother B said okay he said now see he said if you sit there you ain't going to ever get no word just keep walking he said something like this said he said see here you're coming you got this cancer he said but if you'll just keep walking God will heal you go on oh here you come you got this heart condition but if you'll just keep walking and I'm reading through there and he's talking about just keep walk walking just keep walking just keep walking and I'm just fellowshipping with the Lord and I stopped I said Lord I said there's got to be a reason that brother Bram stands there and keeps telling the people just keep walking and I just kept reading and I come across this quote he says see that's the way you get well is just keep on walking I said no I got to go back and read that again that's the way you get well see is just keep on walking I said Lord I believe it you know what he said in my heart just in prayer in my heart these words come if you'll just keep walking you're going to walk from one condition to another I said oh there it is that's why they come on the platform with heart trouble but he said just keep walking you know why because as they were walking they were progressing and as they were progressing they were changing their condition misss I went down and preached that the other day in a church and the brother text me to day he said do we just build a new website he said that's on the front of our website just keep walking he said that was just for our church you know why I say that I know it's simple and I know you've heard it thousands of times but God is made that so real this year in the depths of my heart if you'll just put your walking shoes on I know some of you are tired I know some of you are weary I know you've been in this battle for a long time and it looks like there's no end it looks like it's a hopeless situation but hear this old crazy spit and sweating preacher this morning get up and start walking again things ain't ever going to change as long as you sit there and belly ache and cry you got to get up and dust yourself off and remember who you are you are a son of God Redeemed by the blood of God just keep walking my goodness just keep walking I said Lord how are we going to walk we're going to walk unconscious of criticism we're going to walk unconscious of fear we're going to walk unconscious of what somebody says about us or thinks about us or writes about us I said Lord people are in Trials I'm sorry I'm that guy I just fellowship with him I know yall do too I said Lord people are in trials and situations and Lord help me to preach this word that will help somebody in the middle of a trial I'll tell you this have you ever been in a trial that you just felt like

revelation of this message things will change while you're preaching it young people to this day you know what I'm talking about sitting right here in this church things have changed you know why cuz you kept on [Music] walking never I said to you like this I never will forget one night down there was preaching and brother Josh is in a service and there's a young lady in the meeting been in a hard way standing there preaching I think it was the last time I preached in the old church there preaching there and I watched the power of God I've been burdened in my heart for for a long time just been through some hard things and Pastor went South on her and all kinds of things I just watched the power of God brother Ron come in the building it's chains just fall off of her you know what she told me after service she said brother Ander something changed tonight you know why I say that cuz you got to keep walking God will do the opening if you'll do the walking if you'll walk to the door God will open it you said brother Ander I'm in the darkest trial of my life I'm in the hardest season that I've ever been through and you telling me just keep walking you're exactly right you want some Bible on it the Bible says the Hebrew children walked and stood before the king and they would not bow you know what the problem of God said he said they walked to the fiery furnace will you remember this they walked to the fiery furnace nobody pushed them to it they walked to the fiery furnace brother they opened the door and it was seven times hotter than it had ever been before nobody pushed them into the fire they walked into their trial y'all ever thought about this they got in there and they didn't go sit down and say oh poor pitiful us would the God he would have delivered us oh feel sorry for us other Joel they got in the fire and they walked around in the fire now somebody help me understand this they're bound hand and foot but somehow or another they still found the way to praise God in the middle of a Saturday night service they're bound hand and foot and they still found a way to walk around in their trial and while they were walking around sis all of a sudden a Fourth Man appeared and he loosed them they walked to the fiery furnace they walk walked into the fiery furnace they walked around in the fiery furnace oh but they kept on walking and the conditions changed and they walked out what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying just keep on walking you're going to walk out of it sun will shine again just keep on walking brother Andre I'm tired just keep on walking brother Bram said like this he said there was a young girl one time he said like this said she was Embraces and crutches said she was hobbling around said she wanted to be healed wanted to be well I love what he says he said she come up for prayer she said brother Brandon if you'll pray for me God will heal me you know what he said he said sis you go over somewhere and sit down and he said when God he said God's already healed you he said take those crutches off and he said you're going to walk again she went over and sat down brother Ron took those braces off took those crutches off he said she was there for a few minutes he said but all of a sudden I looked up and she come running and screaming carrying those bran braces and those crutches and she was praising God he said somebody asked me said weren't you worried he said no the vision had already spoke the vision had already spoke the vision had already said she was going to walk can I say it to you the vision has already said you're going in the Rapture the vision has already said thy in thy house shall be saved the vision has already said there's a marriage supper of the lamb and you got a seat at the table how many today says Lord I want to believe what you spoke and I'm going to press until it be becomes a reality somebody say well the devil the devil told me God don't love me that Devil's a liar you imagine that long enough it'll become real to you but it ain't real to God cuz God Loves You by our hearts this morning what they heard bowever I closed would there be one here this morning could say Lord I'm done with a m inations I'm done imagining these things brother BR sat like this he said you're Crossing Bridges before you get to them said you're all nervous you're all tore up how many this morning say Lord I don't have to imagine any longer I can read in your word and I can believe what has been spoken by the vision and I'm going to press towards it I'm going to walk towards it somebody say something about you they say well you're this or you're that and you imagine that and imagine it and imagine it and it becomes a reality and it's really not who you are but it's real to you this morning I believe the holy spirit is dealt with imaginations right here in this building that imagination will build you a complex and that complex will put you in a prison somewhere maybe maybe not a natural prison a spiritual prison and it'll have you afraid to do anything have you afraid to believe anything have you afraid to trust anybody have you afraid to trust a preacher afraid to trust a church it's nothing but an imagination that built a complex but I say this morning House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus I rebuke every imagination here this morning that would try to Blind God's children from seeing the reality of who they are in the word almighty God your word has gone forth in this Sanctuary this morning Lord these Believers have pulled on the gift of God Lord that gift was not put in my life for me Lord it was put there for your children now Lord they operate that gift and Lord as they pulled this morning and pulled on that word father I believe needs have been met right here this morning Lord I pray this morning as your word has gone forth I pray that the power of God has broke the clouds of doubt and depression and oppression Lord I pray if there be somebody here this morning that Lord they they've lost sight of what your word said about them they begin to believe things about themselves and they begin to believe things that they've imagined and they've become real to them and Lord they get angry because somebody else don't believe it or somebody else don't think it the way they do lord it's because it's real to them and nobody else but Lord I'm so thankful this morning that the word of God is not an imagination it's a revelation and Lord it can be real to the elders and the youngest baby Lord it can be real to the preachers to the housewives to the Musicians to the janitors Lord even down to the little Ley the little elder sister that comes to the house of God this word can be real to them now Lord I pray this morning by the power of the Holy Ghost may you give him the grace Lord to press back against these Spirits Lord every devil that's trying to stop them from going forward may they press against it this morning in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus Amen how many this morning would agree with me I have a future can I see your hands I have a future brother Ron we have a fure future there's been days you didn't
