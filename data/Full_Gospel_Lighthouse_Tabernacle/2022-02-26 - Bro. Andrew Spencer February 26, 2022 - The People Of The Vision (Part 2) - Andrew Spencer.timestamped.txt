[56:14] of the bible in revelations chapter 10
[56:17] and verse one and then also to habakkuk
[56:19] chapter two
[56:23] hallelujah
[56:31] i'd like to carry on our i thought from
[56:34] last weekend on the people
[56:37] the people of the vision
[56:40] and i believe
[56:42] i believe i'm speaking to the people of
[56:44] the vision amen
[56:46] amen
[56:48] revelations chapter 10 and say amen when
[56:51] you have it this evening
[56:53] and i saw another mighty angel
[56:55] come down from heaven and clothed with a
[56:57] cloud
[56:58] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[57:00] face
[57:01] was as it were the sun and his feet as
[57:04] pillars of fire
[57:06] and he had in his hand a little book
[57:08] open and
[57:09] he set his right foot upon the sea and
[57:12] is left on the earth
[57:14] and cried with a loud voice as when a
[57:17] lion roareth and when he had cried seven
[57:20] thunders uttered their voices
[57:22] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[57:24] their voices i was about to write and i
[57:27] heard a voice from heaven say unto me
[57:30] seal up those things which the seven
[57:32] thunders uttered and write them not and
[57:35] the angel which i saw stand upon the sea
[57:38] and upon the earth lifted up his hand
[57:40] to heaven and swear by him that liveth
[57:44] forever and ever who created heaven and
[57:47] things therein and the earth and the
[57:49] things therein
[57:51] and the sea and the things which are
[57:53] therein
[57:54] and there should be time no longer that
[57:58] is the time of holding back of all of
[58:00] these things shall be no longer but in
[58:04] the days of the voice of the seventh
[58:06] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[58:09] mystery of god it should be finished as
[58:12] he hath declared to his servants the
[58:14] prophets
[58:15] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[58:17] spake unto me again and said go and take
[58:20] the little book which is open
[58:22] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[58:24] upon the sea and upon the earth and i
[58:27] went unto the angel and said unto him
[58:29] give me the little book and he said unto
[58:32] me take it and eat it up and it shall
[58:34] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[58:37] thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the
[58:39] little book out of the angel's hand and
[58:41] ate it up and it was in my mouth
[58:44] sweetest honey and as soon as i had
[58:47] eaten it my belly was bitter and he said
[58:49] unto me thou must prophesy again before
[58:53] many peoples and nations and tongues
[58:56] and kings
[58:58] habit chapter 2 and verse 2.
[59:04] and the lord answered me and said write
[59:06] the vision and make it plain upon the
[59:08] tables that he may run that readeth it
[59:12] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[59:15] time but at the end it shall speak and
[59:18] not lie
[59:20] though it tarry wait for it because it
[59:22] will surely come it will not tarry so
[59:26] the vision has a voice and the vision
[59:28] will speak may god bless the reading of
[59:31] the word as we say i would like to speak
[59:33] to you on the people the people of the
[59:36] vision and we're certainly thankful to
[59:38] be living in the hour that we're living
[59:40] in in such a great and dreadful day but
[59:42] it's certainly a great day for each and
[59:44] every one of us that are sitting here
[59:46] and i believe that we're a very mature
[59:48] people that recognize that we're living
[59:51] in the hour where it takes a it takes
[59:53] the a people of the eagle anointing to
[59:56] be able to rise above and be able to
[59:58] look into the things of god and not just
[1:00:01] everybody can read the book of
[1:00:02] revelation and be able to understand or
[1:00:05] grasp what it is saying but we know that
[1:00:07] that god will do nothing except he
[1:00:10] reveals himself to his servants the
[1:00:13] prophets and we know that the bible
[1:00:15] would say in amos chapter 3 that that a
[1:00:18] lion hath roared and who will fear and
[1:00:21] that the lord god has spoken and who
[1:00:24] will who can but prophesy and to think
[1:00:27] that this is the hour when the very when
[1:00:29] the very king christ is speaking unto us
[1:00:32] and we recognize that that when a king
[1:00:35] the lion in the jungle when he begins to
[1:00:37] speak everything shuts up everything
[1:00:41] begins to shut up and everything
[1:00:43] everything begins to listen because it
[1:00:45] king has spoken and here we are living
[1:00:48] in this hour where we have watched not
[1:00:50] just a king's sword come down but the
[1:00:52] king's
[1:00:53] sword come down and the voice that you
[1:00:56] have been hearing is not the mind of a
[1:00:58] man it's not the voice of of humanity
[1:01:00] but it's a voice behind the voice and
[1:01:03] it's a vindicated voice and and we know
[1:01:06] that that voice will always come to the
[1:01:08] predestinated children of god those that
[1:01:11] that have that god thought of before the
[1:01:13] foundation of the world that voice will
[1:01:15] come to them it will speak to them and
[1:01:18] jesus said that no man can come to the
[1:01:20] father except he come except my father
[1:01:24] first draws him and when you watch that
[1:01:27] drawing begin to take place in a
[1:01:28] person's life you'll recognize that
[1:01:31] there is a predestinated seed that's
[1:01:33] being drawn to that word and brother
[1:01:36] branham would say in events made clear
[1:01:38] by prophecy he said it's the word
[1:01:40] joining with the word it can't do
[1:01:42] nothing else so you recognize the reason
[1:01:45] that you're here is that the word you
[1:01:48] are a part of that word and you're
[1:01:50] joining yourself to the word and to
[1:01:53] think that we're living in the greatest
[1:01:55] hour in the greatest time when when men
[1:01:58] when men are caught up in chaos of this
[1:02:00] world and just take a look at the last
[1:02:02] week of what what russia and ukraine has
[1:02:05] done and you begin to look at as men are
[1:02:07] running for fear men don't know what to
[1:02:10] do politics doesn't know what to do
[1:02:12] they're raising their head they're
[1:02:13] scratching their head and they're trying
[1:02:15] to find a solution but there's a people
[1:02:18] on earth that ain't nervous there's a
[1:02:20] people that have caught a prophet's
[1:02:22] vision and been able to sit there and
[1:02:24] recognize that they're in the safety net
[1:02:27] they're in the safety zone of god's
[1:02:29] refuge and we have run into that strong
[1:02:32] tower the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:02:35] and there's a people on the face of the
[1:02:37] earth today that believe what this
[1:02:40] messenger has said and i believe that
[1:02:42] god's got some people on earth today
[1:02:45] brother branham would say there'll be
[1:02:46] young men that'll come and grab this
[1:02:48] message and preach this message right on
[1:02:50] to the coming of the lord and i believe
[1:02:52] that even right now that there are men
[1:02:55] that are preaching this message and
[1:02:57] we're in the final days with a final
[1:03:00] message and things are getting ready to
[1:03:02] be wrapped up and the thing that you're
[1:03:04] so solid in is there's a vision that has
[1:03:07] given you insight to be able to look out
[1:03:10] into the future and know that you're
[1:03:12] safe
[1:03:14] to know that you're going to make it
[1:03:16] you're resting on the promises of
[1:03:19] almighty god
[1:03:24] you see those people with
[1:03:26] that with the people with that ego
[1:03:28] anointing upon them they're able to look
[1:03:30] into the blood-bound promises of god and
[1:03:33] see that this is their hour
[1:03:36] and you know that eagle we recognize
[1:03:38] that that god would liken his heritage
[1:03:41] unto eagles is that right and to think
[1:03:44] that tonight that god has called you an
[1:03:47] eagle and the bible said that where the
[1:03:49] carcass is there will the eagles be
[1:03:52] gathered and to think that tonight that
[1:03:54] god has so likened you unto an eagle and
[1:03:57] we know that that eagle that it has it
[1:04:00] has such an ability that it can fly like
[1:04:02] no other bird it can if it gets in
[1:04:05] trouble it can fly straight for the sun
[1:04:08] and it has a special film that's able to
[1:04:10] go over its eyes and fly straight
[1:04:12] towards that ah straight towards that
[1:04:14] sun without it affecting its flight you
[1:04:17] see that bird is a very special built
[1:04:20] bird just like you are a very special
[1:04:23] built people that are built to be able
[1:04:25] to handle the very vision of god
[1:04:29] and to think that tonight that here we
[1:04:31] are a people that are sitting here and
[1:04:33] there's over 8 380 visions that we know
[1:04:36] of that are on tape that's not counting
[1:04:38] the ones that are off the tape but
[1:04:40] that's the ones that you'll hear on tape
[1:04:42] to think that's a night that you're
[1:04:44] sitting here with a vision
[1:04:47] with a vision you ain't lost your vision
[1:04:49] you're not going to perish because you
[1:04:51] have a vision
[1:04:53] and to think that tonight when brother
[1:04:54] branham would go back there in 1962 and
[1:04:57] he would preach sirs is this the sign of
[1:05:00] the end and you remember that brother
[1:05:02] branham was preaching from a vision that
[1:05:04] he had there in 1962 a few weeks before
[1:05:08] he spoke that sermon he is speaking
[1:05:11] about the experience he thought he was
[1:05:13] going to die he thought there was going
[1:05:14] to be a blast that take place he said i
[1:05:17] saw he said i saw five angels he said he
[1:05:20] said he said it could have been no less
[1:05:22] than five angels and it couldn't have
[1:05:24] been no more than seven angels that was
[1:05:26] coming that was coming and notice when
[1:05:29] brother branham gets out there three
[1:05:31] months later he is walking right into
[1:05:34] the vision and those angels meet him up
[1:05:37] there and told him to turn back east and
[1:05:40] go back there and preach those seven
[1:05:42] seals what was those angels doing he was
[1:05:46] loosing you from the creeds and darkness
[1:05:49] of this world
[1:05:51] to think that you would still be bound
[1:05:53] in the ideology of man if it had not
[1:05:56] been for the breaking of those seals but
[1:05:59] because you're a people of the vision
[1:06:01] because you're not a people of a closed
[1:06:04] book god sent an angel
[1:06:07] god sent an angel and a messenger to
[1:06:09] come and preach and loose the seven
[1:06:12] seals
[1:06:14] hallelujah
[1:06:16] hallelujah notice
[1:06:18] when john was on the isle of patmos he
[1:06:20] said in revelations 1 and 9 he said i
[1:06:22] john who also am your brother and
[1:06:25] companion in tribulation
[1:06:27] and in the kingdom and patience of jesus
[1:06:29] christ was in the isle of patmos that is
[1:06:32] called patmos for the word of god
[1:06:35] and for the testimony of jesus christ
[1:06:38] and brother burna picked that up over in
[1:06:40] the patmos vision in the church age
[1:06:42] books he said the series
[1:06:44] of visions of the revelation of the
[1:06:46] person of jesus christ was given to john
[1:06:49] while he was banished to the olipatmas
[1:06:51] he said this island is this island is 30
[1:06:54] miles off the coast of asia minor in the
[1:06:56] aegean sea being rocky and festive with
[1:06:59] snakes and lizards and scorpions it had
[1:07:02] little to no commercial value and so it
[1:07:05] was used by the roman empire for a
[1:07:08] pineal colony where were housed that the
[1:07:11] most desperate criminals uh political
[1:07:14] prisoners and etc
[1:07:16] and to think that tonight that the
[1:07:18] omniscient god
[1:07:20] knows where you are and knows where to
[1:07:23] put you at
[1:07:25] to have you in a place of destiny
[1:07:30] and you think that you've been you've
[1:07:32] been put on a
[1:07:34] on a place or in a spot maybe in grotos
[1:07:37] virginia or in elkton and maybe you've
[1:07:39] been put there and you think why am i
[1:07:41] here
[1:07:43] john was put there because he was
[1:07:45] thought of as a witch
[1:07:50] oh my he was punished short sure he was
[1:07:52] being punished he was being punished for
[1:07:54] preaching and living the same message
[1:07:57] that you believe
[1:07:58] but god knows where to get you at
[1:08:02] so the vision can come forth
[1:08:04] [Music]
[1:08:06] hallelujah
[1:08:07] hallelujah he said now you you'll notice
[1:08:09] that john addressed himself to the
[1:08:11] christians
[1:08:12] as brother in tribulation it was at this
[1:08:15] time that the early church was going
[1:08:17] through great persecutions he said their
[1:08:20] religion was not only everywhere spoken
[1:08:23] everywhere spoken against but the people
[1:08:25] themselves were imprisoned and killed
[1:08:28] and john
[1:08:29] like the multitudes of other was now
[1:08:31] suffering imprisonment for the word of
[1:08:33] god and the testimony of jesus christ
[1:08:36] and when he when arrested they tried in
[1:08:38] vain to kill him by bullying him in oil
[1:08:41] for 24 hours the enraged and powerless
[1:08:44] officials then sentenced him to pacmus
[1:08:47] as a witch
[1:08:50] when god says i'm not done with you yet
[1:08:54] man can do everything they want to you
[1:08:56] but when god says i'm not done with you
[1:08:58] yet
[1:08:59] your vision your vision and your purpose
[1:09:02] will not be thwarted by humanity
[1:09:06] are you with me do you realize that you
[1:09:09] have a purpose and god has a plan
[1:09:12] george whitefield said we are more we
[1:09:14] are immortal until our work on earth is
[1:09:17] done
[1:09:18] so that means that hell can't kill you
[1:09:21] sickness can't destroy you diseases can
[1:09:24] come but diseases won't whip you
[1:09:27] you might have to go through hell in
[1:09:29] high water to get here where you're
[1:09:31] going but you're not going to be stopped
[1:09:33] and you're not going to be defeated the
[1:09:36] vision cannot be hindered
[1:09:42] he said but god
[1:09:44] was with him
[1:09:45] and he was spared to to leave the island
[1:09:47] and return to ephesus where he again
[1:09:50] continued as a pastor until the time of
[1:09:52] his death
[1:09:54] notice brother branham said the visions
[1:09:56] that john received covered a period of
[1:09:58] two years from 1895 through 96
[1:10:02] they are the most remarkable of all
[1:10:05] visions in the word
[1:10:08] the entire book is set forth in symbols
[1:10:11] and therefore is the target of much
[1:10:12] criticism dispute however it does have
[1:10:15] the seal of god upon it
[1:10:17] that makes it authentic and of
[1:10:19] tremendous value to all who read it or
[1:10:22] listen to its sacred pages and to think
[1:10:26] that tonight that the very portion of
[1:10:28] scripture that holds all of your
[1:10:31] promises that testify where you are and
[1:10:34] where you're going is criticized by the
[1:10:37] rest of the world but it has a seal of
[1:10:40] god upon it
[1:10:42] and to think that john when john was up
[1:10:44] there and he he was caught away in the
[1:10:46] spirit uh he was gone and caught up in
[1:10:49] the spirit on the lord's day and that's
[1:10:50] this day and to think that he was living
[1:10:53] back there some 2000 years ago
[1:10:56] living and looking at your day
[1:10:59] and there he was john will see what john
[1:11:01] was seeing in vision you and i are now
[1:11:04] living out in reality that this vision
[1:11:07] has got to come to fulfillment
[1:11:10] that it was not other in any other age
[1:11:12] but it was in this hour that the lamb
[1:11:14] stood up in revelations chapter 5 and
[1:11:17] said who is worthy
[1:11:19] when the elders stood up said who is
[1:11:21] worthy to take this book
[1:11:24] and john stood there john stood there
[1:11:26] and he began to weep and he began to
[1:11:28] think about he looked all over the earth
[1:11:30] and nobody was found worthy he looked
[1:11:32] all over heaven and nobody was found
[1:11:35] worthy but there was an elder that spoke
[1:11:37] up and said don't weep john
[1:11:41] don't weep john for the lion or the
[1:11:43] tribe of judah hath prevailed
[1:11:46] and when he turned to look to him what
[1:11:48] did he see he saw the lamb of god
[1:11:54] what was jesus doing jesus was the
[1:11:56] antitype to boaz
[1:11:59] when boaz was going to redeem naomi's
[1:12:02] estate he went in there and he realized
[1:12:06] you got no ruth had to realize that if
[1:12:08] boaz doesn't overcome and if boaz
[1:12:11] doesn't prevail all of naomi's estate is
[1:12:14] lost
[1:12:15] i'm lost i'm without hope
[1:12:17] but the reason the reason
[1:12:20] that john was weeping is that nobody
[1:12:22] could take that book
[1:12:24] he saw his name on that book
[1:12:28] can you imagine seeing your name on the
[1:12:30] book and nobody's able to come and take
[1:12:32] and that's worthy enough to get you and
[1:12:35] redeem your rights
[1:12:38] and john was weeping because there was
[1:12:41] nobody in heaven found worthy
[1:12:44] oh hallelujah but there was one
[1:12:47] there was one and when john when john
[1:12:51] began to see the vision of the lamb
[1:12:54] the bible said that john began to say
[1:12:56] everything in heaven and everything in
[1:12:58] earth and everything beneath the earth
[1:13:00] and everything above heaven heard i
[1:13:02] saying blessings honor and glory and
[1:13:05] power be unto the name of the lamb
[1:13:09] what is that name that name is jesus
[1:13:13] i tell you every stronghold is thwarted
[1:13:15] by the name of jesus every demon has to
[1:13:18] bow at the name of jesus cancer is
[1:13:21] defeated in the name of jesus laodicea
[1:13:25] cannot stand against the name of jesus
[1:13:29] anxiety cannot stand in the presence of
[1:13:32] jesus
[1:13:33] [Applause]
[1:13:36] hallelujah
[1:13:39] that lamb has redeemed us back
[1:13:41] and brother branham said that redemption
[1:13:43] means all legal possession to all that
[1:13:46] was lost by adam and eve
[1:13:48] and to think that tonight that you and i
[1:13:50] hold in our possession the abstract
[1:13:53] title deed
[1:13:54] that everything that adam lost
[1:13:57] everything that he forfeited
[1:14:00] you and i now hold in our possession he
[1:14:04] said what that ought to do to a
[1:14:05] born-again son and daughter of god
[1:14:09] the bible said in deuteronomy 29 and 29
[1:14:12] the secret things belonging to the lord
[1:14:14] but the things which are revealed belong
[1:14:16] unto you
[1:14:19] it's not no longer closed up it's not no
[1:14:21] longer shut up
[1:14:24] you don't have to guess what it says
[1:14:28] let me preach just just a minute to our
[1:14:30] young people young people you don't have
[1:14:32] to worry you don't have to get caught up
[1:14:34] well i don't know the answers i don't
[1:14:36] understand revelations or i don't
[1:14:38] understand the seals that's your
[1:14:40] book young people that's your book
[1:14:44] young people when you read those seals
[1:14:46] that's not to another generation that's
[1:14:48] your generation this is your book it's
[1:14:51] got your name on it
[1:14:53] and the lamb thought that you were worth
[1:14:55] dying for the lamb thought that you were
[1:14:58] worth healing
[1:15:01] and you hold in your possession
[1:15:03] everything that adam lost
[1:15:05] everything that eve lost you now hold in
[1:15:08] your possession that's why satan's
[1:15:10] afraid of you

[1:15:14] catch a vision and you'll recognize hey
[1:15:17] that's for me and my house
[1:15:19] [Applause]
[1:15:20] [Music]
[1:15:22] satan ain't afraid of your flesh he
[1:15:24] ain't afraid of your mind he ain't even
[1:15:26] afraid of your spirit but he's afraid of
[1:15:28] your soul catching a hold of what the
[1:15:31] vision that spoke about you
[1:15:35] what john was seeing in vision you are
[1:15:37] now in reality
[1:15:39] there's a people of the vision
[1:15:47] to think that john was standing there as
[1:15:49] a type of me
[1:15:51] going and taking the book not out of the
[1:15:53] hand of the earthly angel but out of the
[1:15:55] hand of the mighty angel
[1:15:57] he said this is your book eat this book
[1:16:00] become this book devour this book it'll
[1:16:03] be this book that'll get you in a
[1:16:04] rapture

[1:16:07] overcome pornography it'll make this
[1:16:09] book that'll make you overcome the
[1:16:11] diseases of laodicea
[1:16:15] let me say outside of this message there
[1:16:18] is no overcoming power because there is
[1:16:20] no restoration but under the message of
[1:16:23] malachi 4
[1:16:24] there is an overcoming power
[1:16:31] hallelujah
[1:16:33] adam couldn't meet those requirements
[1:16:35] solomon couldn't meet those requirements
[1:16:38] daniel couldn't meet those requirements
[1:16:40] but there was one that was worthy
[1:16:45] when brother shannon couldn't do it when
[1:16:47] brother nathanael couldn't do it when
[1:16:49] brother ron couldn't do it the lamb
[1:16:51] stood up and said i'm worthy enough for
[1:16:53] him
[1:16:55] i'm worthy enough to redeem them
[1:16:57] [Applause]
[1:16:59] you may have been put in you may have
[1:17:01] been put in the pawn shop but i want you
[1:17:03] to know jesus walked in and paid the
[1:17:05] price for you

[1:27:05] you that satan may never come in contact
[1:27:08] with

[1:27:16] wires
[1:27:17] he said he shook he shook hell right
[1:27:19] back off when satan come in there and
[1:27:21] grabbed a hold of it i want you to know
[1:27:23] the same power that was in jesus is
[1:27:25] living in the people
[1:27:31] f5 bob's worst
[1:27:33] your success
[1:27:35] and your usefulness
[1:27:37] in the world is going to be measured by
[1:27:39] your confession
[1:27:40] and by the tenacity with which you hold
[1:27:43] fast the confession under all
[1:27:46] circumstances
[1:27:48] anybody can hold fast their profession
[1:27:50] right here
[1:27:53] anybody can hold past the profession
[1:27:55] well brother angel i got him on the
[1:27:57] other line he say he's my contact i mean
[1:28:00] he's going to go with me this week he's
[1:28:02] going to walk with me i can tell you i
[1:28:04] ain't got enough time
[1:28:05] to spend that time with every single one
[1:28:07] of you
[1:28:09] but i serve a god
[1:28:11] that's omniscient he's omnipresent
[1:28:14] he'll walk with you be in you
[1:28:19] but hold fast that confession under all
[1:28:23] circumstances
[1:28:24] and if there ever was a day to hold fast
[1:28:27] it's this day if there ever was a day to
[1:28:30] wave the banner of the holy ghost
[1:28:33] it's this day
[1:28:34] when zechariah would prophesy that
[1:28:36] there's one coming
[1:28:38] that there's one coming and he'll he'll
[1:28:40] ride on a coat to full of an ass what
[1:28:42] was brother branham saying he said when
[1:28:45] he cut that he said jesus was the answer
[1:28:49] to the prophet's prophecy
[1:28:53] i say again this day this scripture is
[1:28:56] fulfilled
[1:28:58] you are the answer to william branham's
[1:29:00] prophecy that she'll be without spot
[1:29:03] she'll be without wrinkle she won't be
[1:29:05] no pushover she's not some fly by night
[1:29:08] school girl she's robed in the
[1:29:11] righteousness of christ the holy ghost
[1:29:13] is the power on the inside of her
[1:29:17] i know there's anointed one at the end
[1:29:19] times but you are the true anointed one
[1:29:21] there's false ones out there but god is
[1:29:24] in his church
[1:29:25] and that gene seed of god cannot sin
[1:29:31] you are
[1:29:33] a different class of people
[1:29:36] you are of a divine nature
[1:29:39] when john said come up hither he's
[1:29:41] talking about you
[1:29:42] when brother random would talk about two
[1:29:44] worlds he's talking about you and god is
[1:29:47] so built to people who are built to pass
[1:29:50] the test
[1:29:53] and when laodicea cannot overcome and
[1:29:55] they cannot win
[1:29:57] you can
[1:30:00] when the rest of the world is in chaos
[1:30:03] you're in victory when hell is upset
[1:30:06] you're glad
[1:30:07] all hell can be against you but all
[1:30:10] heaven is behind you
[1:30:16] i thought i felt somebody looking over
[1:30:17] my shoulder yeah
[1:30:19] you do
[1:30:20] you got somebody that's watching over
[1:30:22] you our young our young kids used to

[1:30:30] accountability those angels are still
[1:30:32] there i don't want you to know that the
[1:30:35] god of angel armies is fighting your
[1:30:38] battles
[1:30:39] that is still on your side if it had not
[1:30:42] been for the lord who was on our side
[1:30:46] where would we be at but because we have

[1:31:15] able maybe to feel the brush of angel's
[1:31:18] wings but there's angels sitting all

[1:31:23] david said in psalms 84 and 11 that the
[1:31:26] lord
[1:31:27] god is a son and a shield
[1:31:31] the lord will give grace and glory no
[1:31:34] good thing
[1:31:35] will he withhold from them

[1:33:01] i want you to realize that there's
[1:33:04] angels sitting around you
[1:33:06] we've talked about bumping into angels
[1:33:08] when you go to worship and maybe you
[1:33:10] don't understand why you worship but you
[1:33:12] all of a sudden shout out hallelujah
[1:33:15] it's because you begin to bump into an
[1:33:17] angel
[1:33:20] you think why in the world i i know that
[1:33:23] i know that this is real criticized
[1:33:24] right now and i don't know why in the
[1:33:25] world it is
[1:33:27] but
[1:33:27] it is such a
[1:33:29] it's such an attack on worship
[1:33:32] it's such an attack on praise in the
[1:33:35] hour that we're living in
[1:33:37] when men ought to be praising god and
[1:33:39] when men ought to be worshipping god
[1:33:42] but brother barnum said that when you
[1:33:43] all of a sudden you start worshiping you
[1:33:46] bumped into an angel
[1:33:50] oh come on somebody i got to reading
[1:33:53] today over in mark chapter 13 and when
[1:33:56] jesus was talking about his coming he
[1:33:58] said and he will come on the go he will
[1:34:01] come in the clouds brother branham said
[1:34:03] he said he's not talking about some
[1:34:05] white thunderhead up there he's talking
[1:34:08] about he's coming in a cloud of
[1:34:10] witnesses
[1:34:12] he's coming in a cloud of angels the
[1:34:14] same ones that have protected you the
[1:34:17] same ones that have watched over you the
[1:34:19] same ones that you bumped into will be
[1:34:21] the same ones
[1:34:23] that come with christ when your body is
[1:34:26] changed
[1:34:28] can you imagine that one angel that
[1:34:30] watched over top of jerry braden all of
[1:34:33] his life watched over him made sure he
[1:34:35] was taken care of make sure he didn't
[1:34:37] get sickened as a baby make sure he
[1:34:40] didn't get a dreadful disease it'll be
[1:34:42] that same angel that's protected you all
[1:34:44] of your days that said hey
[1:34:46] something's about to take place papa god
[1:34:49] just called me back home
[1:34:54] that same one that watched you brother
[1:34:56] jeffrey will be the same one that
[1:34:58] watches you change your mortal body into
[1:35:01] immortality
[1:35:03] [Music]
[1:35:11] hallelujah
[1:35:13] there was an angel that was watching
[1:35:14] over you that made sure you came to this
[1:35:16] message
[1:35:20] when you wanted to walk away
[1:35:24] when you tried to give up
[1:35:26] there was an angel that put his hand on
[1:35:28] the door and said you're not gonna kill
[1:35:30] yourself you're not gonna destroy your
[1:35:32] life you're born with a destiny
[1:35:38] if it had not been for jesus
[1:35:42] if it had not been for jesus
[1:35:46] we got some more thomas eating
[1:35:53] we know that abraham had had two sons
[1:35:57] which are symbolic to law
[1:35:59] and grace
[1:36:00] is that is that right
[1:36:02] and and it's it's for
[1:36:04] for there are two covenants
[1:36:06] and one of them is according to mount
[1:36:08] sinai but the other one which which
[1:36:11] melsania which gives birth to bondage
[1:36:13] but the other one corresponds to christ
[1:36:16] in his coming
[1:36:18] and paul would grab it over in galatians
[1:36:20] and he would say that that brethren
[1:36:22] we're not children of the bonds woman
[1:36:24] but of the free
[1:36:26] and we go in in galatians again the next
[1:36:28] chapter and he would say stand fast
[1:36:31] therefore in the liberty where christ
[1:36:34] has made us free and do not be entangled
[1:36:37] again with the yoke of bondage
[1:36:40] so do you realize
[1:36:41] do you realize that you are not of the
[1:36:44] bonds woman
[1:36:46] you're not a type of the slave
[1:36:50] you're a type of the free woman
[1:36:54] you're a type
[1:36:55] you're not a type of hagar
[1:36:57] you're a type of sarah
[1:37:00] you're a type of the free woman
[1:37:02] that it was promised you that you're
[1:37:03] gonna have a child
[1:37:05] so paul says you can stand fast
[1:37:07] therefore in the liberty where christ
[1:37:10] has made you free so let me put it into
[1:37:13] your language you are a free son and
[1:37:16] daughter of god
[1:37:17] that you're free to operate like a son
[1:37:19] you're free to cast satan down you're
[1:37:22] free to have full victory you're free to
[1:37:24] worship you're free to pure worship
[1:37:27] you're free you're free to pre-praise
[1:37:32] and jesus said
[1:37:34] that whom the son is set free
[1:37:40] we got any slaves sitting here tonight
[1:37:45] slave to captivity slave to fear slave
[1:37:47] to anxiety i'm gonna always live with
[1:37:50] this
[1:37:54] all right
[1:37:56] i'm gonna preach through some slaves
[1:37:58] just for a moment
[1:38:00] you're not enslaved by bonds of chains
[1:38:03] that god has put on you
[1:38:06] you're enslaved by your own mind
[1:38:08] johnny crow you can go fly
[1:38:13] you are not bound you are not bound by
[1:38:16] the chains of almighty god you are bound
[1:38:19] with things of your own mind because
[1:38:21] christ has already set you free
[1:38:24] i want you to know there were some big
[1:38:26] boys one day that climbed on top of a
[1:38:29] hill and they shot it down from the top
[1:38:31] of that hill they knew that when the sun
[1:38:33] was rising that they were free because
[1:38:36] there was a president that signed a
[1:38:38] proclamation that they could go free i
[1:38:41] want you to turn your eyes towards
[1:38:43] calvary my big brother
[1:38:45] climbed the highest hill and said you
[1:38:48] can go free you don't have to live with
[1:38:50] anxiety you don't have to live with
[1:38:52] depression you don't have to live with
[1:38:54] the love spirit
[1:38:56] for whom the son is set free is free
[1:38:59] indeed and where the spirit of the lord
[1:39:01] is there is liberty
[1:39:05] i'm like patrick henry give me liberty
[1:39:08] or give me death
[1:39:10] give me the liberty of the spirit
[1:39:12] don't hold me back let me worship let me
[1:39:15] praise
[1:39:20] i'm not going to let no devil steal me
[1:39:22] from my worship
[1:39:24] and i ain't going to let no devil try to
[1:39:26] steal any son and daughter of god away

[1:47:07] it's that scarred one that fault in the
[1:47:10] battle for my prodigals it's that
[1:47:12] scarred wood that stood there and said
[1:47:14] he's the lord our god that healeth all
[1:47:15] of our
[1:47:20] diseases i
[1:47:23] am
[1:47:24] a disciple
[1:47:29] i don't know if you're keeping up with
[1:47:30] anything that's going on in the world
[1:47:34] not saying you have to
[1:47:37] all you need to be doing is looking up
[1:47:42] but putin
[1:47:46] putin made a a remark
[1:47:49] that he was going
[1:47:52] he was going after finland
[1:47:55] and he was going after sweden
[1:47:57] that he wasn't just going to stop of
[1:47:58] ukraine
[1:48:01] so finland's ambassador
[1:48:04] said today he said we're not in a
[1:48:06] position
[1:48:07] that we will get scared because of one
[1:48:09] statement
[1:48:16] one statement
[1:48:18] we're not in a position to get scared by
[1:48:20] one statement
[1:48:23] he went on to say we have one of the
[1:48:25] best armies in all of europe
[1:48:30] i'll tell you what that's a man right
[1:48:31] there that's a man
[1:48:35] it's putin he's a savage
[1:48:38] he's anointed for his job
[1:48:41] we're praying for the people of god and
[1:48:43] for those those innocent souls over
[1:48:45] there
[1:48:48] man was not made to destroy one another
[1:48:50] but demons
[1:48:51] have got in and started working amongst
[1:48:53] people and its nations at war its demons
[1:48:56] at war
[1:48:57] but i began to think about this man that
[1:48:59] could stand there with that kind of
[1:49:01] tenacity and say we're not in a position
[1:49:03] to get scared because of one statement
[1:49:06] but people get backed off of the
[1:49:08] promises of god because they say because
[1:49:10] satan says you're not good enough
[1:49:14] he says you're not strong enough says
[1:49:16] you'll never make it
[1:49:18] i want to whisper back to the devil
[1:49:20] we're not in a position to get staring
[1:49:21] scared because of one statement we got
[1:49:24] the best army that's ever been on the
[1:49:26] face of the earth it's the army of the
[1:49:28] most high god he never lost a battle and
[1:49:31] he ain't planning on losing one he's
[1:49:33] undefeated he's unconquered
[1:49:37] he's going to remain that for all of
[1:49:38] eternity
[1:49:40] i got the best army on my side i'm
[1:49:43] better guarded than all of russia all of
[1:49:45] ukraine and all of the united states of
[1:49:48] america i got the host of the army with
[1:49:51] me on my side
[1:49:56] oh somebody giving praise in the house
[1:49:58] of god
[1:50:02] hallelujah
[1:50:08] you didn't sign up to get in this family
[1:50:10] you didn't sign up you were born into
[1:50:12] this family you got heirs as a child of
[1:50:15] god
[1:50:16] [Applause]
[1:50:21] uh
[1:50:22] give me a moment i know good and well
[1:50:26] that if my mom and daddy could have
[1:50:27] dreamed up
[1:50:28] what kind of boy they was going to have
[1:50:31] they probably wouldn't have dreamed up
[1:50:32] somebody like me
[1:50:38] maybe in my later years
[1:50:47] but i'd say that if
[1:50:49] if my parents could have a vision what
[1:50:51] am i 34 years old
[1:50:55] if my parents could have had a vision
[1:50:57] 35 years ago
[1:51:02] man we want our visions to be perfect
[1:51:04] don't we
[1:51:07] jeff go ahead
[1:51:09] work on that vision man
[1:51:10] get that thing right i want it this way
[1:51:12] lord go ahead he said ask and you shall
[1:51:14] receive knock and it shall be open keep
[1:51:16] on asking
[1:51:18] but i'd say that if my mom and daddy
[1:51:20] could
[1:51:21] well
[1:51:21] if they could ask
[1:51:23] i could have declared what this vision
[1:51:25] was going to look like
[1:51:30] maybe in my mind they would ask for
[1:51:31] somebody like this
[1:51:36] not like this
[1:51:40] they'd ask for somebody that would maybe
[1:51:42] had an intelligent mind maybe maybe
[1:51:44] somebody definitely don't have that
[1:51:46] maybe that somebody would go somewhere
[1:51:48] and be able to do something with their
[1:51:50] life and
[1:51:51] maybe necessarily wouldn't have red hair
[1:51:54] and it would transcend down into the
[1:51:56] brain
[1:51:57] i told mom the other day
[1:51:59] that the reason my my red hair was so
[1:52:02] red when i was younger is because she
[1:52:04] beat the blood out of my rear end all
[1:52:06] the way up into my head
[1:52:11] she wouldn't ask for somebody that come
[1:52:13] with uh
[1:52:15] with that kind of tenacity in their mind
[1:52:17] and all kinds of things and making up
[1:52:19] all kinds of games and throwing mud pies
[1:52:21] at the house and creating all kinds of
[1:52:23] chaos and making up bombs and everything
[1:52:25] else blowing up fences and turning over
[1:52:28] four-wheelers every time they wanted to
[1:52:31] they wouldn't ask for somebody like that
[1:52:36] they would have dreamed of somebody
[1:52:40] in a male body
[1:52:44] with the sweet loving atmosphere
[1:52:47] of a girl named whitney
[1:52:51] drew why can't you be like your sister
[1:52:54] loving and caring
[1:52:57] she never gives us one problem that's
[1:52:59] cause i don't tell on her
[1:53:06] well you ought to be mad
[1:53:25] but god so seen me
[1:53:30] he knew i make up
[1:53:32] he knew how i'd be built
[1:53:36] he knew i'd have a temper that needed to
[1:53:38] be calmed down he knew i had a short
[1:53:41] fuse
[1:53:43] so he turned that around for his good
[1:53:48] so he took my makeup
[1:53:50] and started blending his word with my
[1:53:52] makeup
[1:53:54] i still got a short fuse
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:53:57] you mess with one of god's children
[1:54:00] and i want you to know you ain't got all
[1:54:02] hell to deal with you got all of heaven
[1:54:04] to deal with
[1:54:06] you mess with one of four gospel
[1:54:08] children
[1:54:09] you mess with one of our sheep around
[1:54:11] here and you watch what'll happen
[1:54:14] god put some pastors in the pulpit that
[1:54:16] weren't some wishy-washy but men that
[1:54:19] had backbones had a tenacity
[1:54:22] that would stand up and fight for you
[1:54:24] when nobody else would fight for you
[1:54:26] when you didn't even care about yourself
[1:54:29] when he didn't have no hope about
[1:54:30] yourself but god put some pastors in
[1:54:33] place that believed in hope against hope
[1:54:40] but he made you just the way he wanted
[1:54:43] you he said he brought this one of that
[1:54:45] one to this one of that one until he got
[1:54:47] exactly what he wanted
[1:54:49] i'd say god's looking at the vision and
[1:54:52] the vision is speaking
[1:54:55] that's my bride that's my wife you can't
[1:54:58] be separated from the groom
[1:55:02] [Applause]
[1:55:05] hallelujah
[1:55:07] hallelujah
[1:55:09] he knew exactly what you needed brother
[1:55:11] nathaniel
[1:55:13] he placed things on the inside of you
[1:55:15] that he couldn't place on the inside of
[1:55:16] anybody else
[1:55:18] [Laughter]
[1:55:21] don't mess with him
[1:55:22] spiritually or naturally god put
[1:55:24] something on the inside of him that if
[1:55:26] you mess with one of his pastors
[1:55:32] get that guy back here
[1:55:34] that bad guy back here at that back door
[1:55:36] you mess with one of these children
[1:55:38] sitting in here
[1:55:40] you let some person come in here possess
[1:55:42] with a demon
[1:55:49] it won't be heavenly battles no more
[1:55:51] that you worried about being natural
[1:55:52] battles
[1:55:55] you let somebody walk in here
[1:55:58] there's a shepherd watching over this
[1:56:00] place
[1:56:02] you let some gnome school walk in here
[1:56:04] and tell he think he's going to
[1:56:05] terrorize this church
[1:56:08] we got men in position
[1:56:11] to take care of whatever needs to be
[1:56:12] taken care of if you need to be patted
[1:56:15] carried out put a pacifier in we don't
[1:56:17] put pacifiers in
[1:56:20] and we don't clean diapers
[1:56:23] but i tell you what we will do
[1:56:24] we'll tell you how to win
[1:56:26] and we'll tell you how to overcome
[1:56:29] but if you come in here
[1:56:30] if the devil gets a bright idea to walk
[1:56:32] in here and says he's going to disrupt
[1:56:34] this service
[1:56:35] god's got men in place
[1:56:38] the devil tried it one time and those
[1:56:40] men
[1:56:40] busted out that door
[1:56:44] they didn't know which one was coming
[1:56:45] good bad or ugly
[1:56:48] busted out the door and the demons
[1:56:50] started running for cover
[1:56:53] but god's put something on the inside of
[1:56:55] you
[1:56:57] that only the vision knows
[1:57:02] i'm not nowhere near done
[1:57:04] but what i got once more
[1:57:09] but what god's put on the inside of you
[1:57:13] is overcoming power
[1:57:17] and you're going to say exactly what he
[1:57:19] says
[1:57:21] you're going to speak
[1:57:22] what he has spoken
[1:57:24] he put something on the inside of you as
[1:57:26] a child of god
[1:57:28] that cannot be separated cannot be
[1:57:31] pulled apart
[1:57:35] you watch that seed as it goes down into
[1:57:37] the ground
[1:57:38] in springtime
[1:57:40] and you watch as that summer's sun comes
[1:57:42] up on it
[1:57:45] if you put oil on that seed it's going
[1:57:47] to kill it
[1:57:50] but if you put water there good nutrient
[1:57:53] water rain water from heaven
[1:57:55] all of a sudden that summer sun will
[1:57:56] come and start pulling up
[1:58:01] start pulling up
[1:58:03] everything that's laying on the inside
[1:58:05] of it
[1:58:09] we knew we'd have harvest
[1:58:11] because we planted something
[1:58:17] we knew
[1:58:19] we knew this was coming to this church
[1:58:22] we knew what was coming because we knew
[1:58:23] what was sowed
[1:58:28] god knows what's coming because he knows
[1:58:30] what he sowed
[1:58:34] and when he starts shining that s-o-n
[1:58:36] down on top he starts pulling out all of
[1:58:39] that beauty
[1:58:41] at first when he started to come up
[1:58:44] you couldn't handle
[1:58:46] you couldn't handle that hot presence
[1:58:49] so he covered you
[1:58:51] he shaded you
[1:58:52] and he started pulling out all that
[1:58:54] beauty
[1:58:59] you know sometimes
[1:59:01] depending on the type of seed it is
[1:59:04] it takes years
[1:59:06] years for it to ever to manifest
[1:59:10] i know that there's one seed
[1:59:13] i believe it's a chinese bamboo
[1:59:16] that it's one seed you have to water it
[1:59:18] every year every day for five years
[1:59:22] and you never see it for five years you
[1:59:24] never see it
[1:59:26] but a faithful gardener knows what he's
[1:59:28] planted
[1:59:31] and he waters it and he waters it and he
[1:59:33] waters it and he waters it
[1:59:36] and on that fifth year
[1:59:38] it shoots up
[1:59:40] i believe to over a hundred feet
[1:59:44] because he knew what he watered
[1:59:47] i want you to know that god knows
[1:59:49] what he's watered
[1:59:51] and he knows what's going to be produced
[1:59:54] come stand with us this evening
[1:59:57] give the lord praise in the house of god
[2:00:14] aren't you thankful
[2:00:16] that he's in charge of the garden
[2:00:19] he's got a vision of what you're going
[2:00:22] to look like

[2:00:26] about gardening
[2:00:28] i'm tired of winter
[2:00:31] i got real sick of seeing snow every
