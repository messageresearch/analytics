[47:03] and he taught me he taught me Matthew
[47:06] guitar and we lost

[53:11] Lord Jesus for all that you have done
[53:12] for us in this generation Lord God we

[53:17] Authority and express and witness of the
[53:19] wonderwork power of Jesus Christ for for
[53:22] countless days Lord Jesus of how good
[53:25] that you've been to us
[53:26] and father we just have gathered here
[53:28] one more time Lord with needs on our
[53:30] lives and we've come here Lord Jesus to
[53:33] allow the word of God to wash over our
[53:36] lives and Minister unto us and to bless
[53:38] us for truly Lord Jesus we're your
[53:40] children and we we've come to your house
[53:43] father to hear from you we pray father
[53:45] that you would come in a very uh uh very
[53:48] Supernatural way Lord very subtle Lord
[53:51] that we would know that it was the the
[53:53] author of the book that was beginning to
[53:55] just allow The Winds of the Holy Ghost
[53:57] to blow through the building father now
[53:59] you see these hands that are lifted up
[54:01] you see these needs that have been
[54:03] presented unto you we ask father that
[54:05] thou would us come and have thine own
[54:07] way here tonight in the name of Jesus
[54:10] Christ amen amen Revelations chapter 1
[54:15] and verse
[54:16] 6 and hath made us Kings and priest unto
[54:21] God and his and his
[54:24] father to him be glory and Dominion
[54:28] forever and ever amen 1st Samuel chapter
[54:32] 16 and verse one and while you're
[54:35] turning there I'm just going to read
[54:37] reread that verse in Revelation again
[54:40] and he hath made us Kings and priest
[54:42] unto God and his father to be glory and
[54:47] Dominion forever and ever amen 1 Samuel
[54:50] chapter 16 and verse one and the Lord
[54:53] said unto Samuel how long will thou
[54:56] mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected
[55:00] him from reigning over Israel feel thine
[55:04] horn with oil and go and I will send
[55:07] thee to Jesse the bethlehemite for I
[55:10] have provided me a king amongst his son
[55:14] we realize he's still Jehovah Gyra that
[55:18] he can take anything and make something
[55:20] out of it verse 12 and he sent and
[55:24] brought him in now he was Ruddy when you
[55:27] look at that word Ruddy I really like
[55:29] that
[55:31] word he was
[55:33] redheaded he was Ruddy and with all I
[55:36] used to be redheaded that's why I like
[55:37] that word and and my wife's done turn me
[55:40] a little bit gray-headed but praise God
[55:42] anyhow and with all of a beautiful
[55:45] countenance now that ain't got nothing
[55:47] to do with me right there and goodly
[55:49] look to look to and the Lord said arise
[55:52] anoint him for this is he then Sam took
[55:56] the Horn of oil and anointed him in the
[55:59] midst of his Brethren and the spirit of
[56:01] the Lord Came Upon David and from that
[56:03] day forward so Samuel rose up and went
[56:06] to Rama now notice notice these these
[56:10] two verses together you can't you can't
[56:12] separate them but the spirit of the Lord
[56:16] departed from Saul and an evil spirit
[56:19] from the Lord troubled him now you might
[56:22] look at it and you might see a timeline
[56:24] and you could see where the spirit of
[56:25] the Lord was taken away from Saul but
[56:28] you cannot take away these two these two
[56:31] moments that you're looking at here in
[56:33] history that when David is Anointed to
[56:36] be king that the spirit of the Lord
[56:37] departs from Saul and an evil spirit
[56:40] begins to trouble the Lord the reason
[56:42] why that that Saul was set up so that an
[56:45] evil spirit could come and trouble him
[56:48] was because he had rejected the headship
[56:50] of the word all right we'll let you be
[56:53] seated here tonight in the in the
[56:54] presence of the Lord I'd like to take a
[56:57] thought uh from this from this quote
[57:00] that I'm getting ready to read to you
[57:02] that brother Brandon would preach a
[57:05] series on on the great warrior and he
[57:07] would preach on the great warrior David
[57:09] and he would preach on the great warrior
[57:11] Joshua and I was just I was just going
[57:13] through this it's a real short real
[57:15] short service that brother brandham
[57:17] takes there and then you can hear it on
[57:19] the backside brother brandham goes into
[57:20] a into a healing meeting but brother
[57:23] brandom says some very profound things
[57:25] in 19 55 here he said now now notice
[57:28] David was called by election he was
[57:31] elected called and anointed and placed
[57:34] and by the help of the Lord I'd like to
[57:36] take these these four words as a subject
[57:39] tonight and I'd like to preach to you on
[57:41] a on a on a thought on positionally
[57:43] placed as a King David was was elected
[57:47] called anointed and placed elected by
[57:50] God called from the Sheep hering to be
[57:52] king anointed and positionally placed he
[57:55] said look Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph
[57:58] Abraham election Isaac
[58:01] justification and Jacob Grace and Joseph
[58:05] Perfection he said all right there you
[58:07] are called you are he said are you a
[58:11] David are you a David called elected
[58:15] first by God now how many Christians are
[58:18] here raise up your hand you're not a
[58:20] Christian by your desire you are a
[58:22] Christian by God's desire amen no man
[58:25] can come to me except my father draws
[58:28] him first you was elected by God before
[58:30] the foundation of the world to be a
[58:32] Christian that's scripture Jesus said no
[58:35] man can come to me except my father
[58:38] calls him he said so first thing you was
[58:40] elected called and then when God elected
[58:43] you then he called you and you heeded to
[58:45] his call then he poured the anointing
[58:47] oil on you the Holy Ghost and when the
[58:50] crws of oil what does the oil represent
[58:53] in the Bible the Holy Spirit and when he
[58:55] poured the oil upon him he baptized him
[58:59] with the Holy Spirit in a symbol form he
[59:02] said I hope you get that that just come
[59:04] fresh he poured the oil upon him and
[59:07] just went all over him a whole horn full
[59:10] of it not sparingly and that's the way
[59:13] God pours the holy ghost on a man not
[59:16] sparingly he just baptizes him into it
[59:19] anointing him with the spirit notice he
[59:21] right then when that anointing struck
[59:24] him he was positionally placed as king
[59:27] when that anointing struck him he was
[59:30] positionally placed as king and you are
[59:32] positionally placed in Christ Jesus as
[59:35] Kings and Priests is that right the
[59:37] moment you receive the Holy Ghost I want
[59:39] you to capture these words the moment
[59:41] you receive the Holy Ghost the Holy
[59:44] Spirit God places you in the kingdom and
[59:47] air he said what a beautiful picture
[59:50] there you are now Paul in his letter in
[59:52] the Ephesian book when you look at it
[59:54] brother brandham brother brandham would
[59:55] come and tie these things together from
[59:57] Joshua that Ephesians parallels Joshua
[1:00:00] and Paul writing here in the third verse
[1:00:02] he said blessed be the God and father of
[1:00:05] our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us
[1:00:08] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:00:12] places in Christ Jesus and we realize
[1:00:14] that Heavenly places is the believer's
[1:00:17] position in Christ Jesus and I I know
[1:00:20] that many of us as Christians that that
[1:00:22] many of us will we might feel like we
[1:00:25] have never being in a position to be
[1:00:27] able to say that we have amounted to
[1:00:29] anything or we might feel like sometimes
[1:00:32] that that we have never been in a
[1:00:33] position that we could say that we have
[1:00:36] witnessed the the supernatural or the
[1:00:38] spectacular come out of our own mortal
[1:00:41] flesh of by laying on the hands of of
[1:00:43] the sick and them being healed and being
[1:00:45] restored or or performing a miracle by
[1:00:48] by by speaking a word of Prophecy or
[1:00:50] things of that nature over over over
[1:00:53] somebody's life of maybe you can't put
[1:00:55] it put it down in paper where you where
[1:00:58] you saw a physical manifestation of the
[1:01:00] Holy Ghost and I realize that many many
[1:01:03] of Christians they they battle with
[1:01:05] Satan's attacks and his assments on
[1:01:08] making us feel like we are inadequate
[1:01:11] for not seeing or or understanding the
[1:01:14] very Supernatural or not seeing physical
[1:01:16] manifestation of God's power and Satan
[1:01:19] likes to make you feel like you are
[1:01:21] inadequate or or you're ill equipped and
[1:01:23] that just because you haven't seen
[1:01:25] something with a natural or in your own
[1:01:28] human life but in all actuality
[1:01:30] everything that you are as a Christian
[1:01:32] is is anything but ordinary I don't
[1:01:35] believe that that that that word
[1:01:37] ordinary should be in the Christian's
[1:01:39] vocabulary because there's nothing
[1:01:41] ordinary about a son and daughter of God
[1:01:43] because actually your whole entire life
[1:01:46] is Supernatural your entire being is
[1:01:48] Supernatural me and my wife was just
[1:01:50] talking yesterday to actually be a to
[1:01:53] actually have healthy born children in a
[1:01:55] world that we live in of of of of food
[1:01:58] that is depleted of nutrients to to be
[1:02:01] able to raise up children and to them to
[1:02:03] have all their function abilities I'd
[1:02:05] say it's It's Supernatural in in the
[1:02:07] least to be able to say that to have
[1:02:09] faith in a time of doubt it's completely
[1:02:12] Supernatural and to think about David
[1:02:14] when he was there and you might you he
[1:02:16] might have felt like he was
[1:02:17] insignificant as a little bitty old
[1:02:19] Shepherd boy when he was out there doing
[1:02:21] what his brothers wouldn't wouldn't do
[1:02:23] he was out there doing something and he
[1:02:25] might have looked like at some point in
[1:02:27] his life that he had been forgotten
[1:02:29] about and maybe in some people's eyes
[1:02:31] that David was underprivileged I would
[1:02:33] say that if you looked and you think
[1:02:35] about Mary the mother of Jesus that
[1:02:37] carried Jesus I'd say that she she may
[1:02:40] have never imagined that she was going
[1:02:42] to be chosen for something that was
[1:02:44] going to be so extraordinary that the
[1:02:47] world it would crumble the ideas of
[1:02:50] humanity that a virgin could could
[1:02:52] conceive and to think that she's going
[1:02:54] to be a part of this I highly doubt when
[1:02:57] her parents were were birthing her that
[1:02:59] when she came here that those things
[1:03:01] begin to come into her mind when you
[1:03:04] begin to think about the woman that
[1:03:05] washed Jesus's feet I I would say that
[1:03:08] it was likely that that likely she never
[1:03:10] thought that that she was going to be
[1:03:12] remembered throughout the generations
[1:03:15] but I love what David said in Psalm 65
[1:03:17] and4 that blessed is a man whom thou
[1:03:20] choosest and causest to approach unto
[1:03:23] thee that he may dwell in thy courts and
[1:03:26] we shall be satisfied with the goodness
[1:03:28] of thine house even of thy Holy
[1:03:31] Temple I'd say each of these members
[1:03:34] that we've just talked about I never
[1:03:36] look at them as days gone by but I
[1:03:38] always look at as as as characters in
[1:03:41] The Bible as a part of who we are and I
[1:03:43] I'd say that each of them each of them
[1:03:46] may have lived a life when they seem
[1:03:48] like it may have been just an ordinary
[1:03:50] life but I want you to realize that they
[1:03:53] was called for a greater purpose and
[1:03:55] they were were lifted up into Heavenly
[1:03:57] places and they were positioned by
[1:03:59] almighty God for something far beyond
[1:04:01] what they could see far beyond what they
[1:04:03] could comprehend and I I'd like to just
[1:04:06] maybe start this service here tonight
[1:04:07] and say so are you that your whole
[1:04:10] entire life is Supernatural and I never
[1:04:12] want it to be in your mind that you are
[1:04:14] just subpar that that that you are just
[1:04:17] ordinary because if youve receive the
[1:04:20] Holy Ghost you are Supernatural from the
[1:04:23] very crown of your head to the Souls of
[1:04:26] your feet if you have the baptism of the
[1:04:28] Holy Ghost you have something that the
[1:04:30] devil has never had a part of you are a
[1:04:33] Powerhouse if you have a touch of
[1:04:36] Destiny by the Holy Ghost you have
[1:04:38] something that the world is trying to
[1:04:41] attain and Paul said in 1 Corinthians
[1:04:44] 1:27 that God has chosen the foolish
[1:04:46] things of this world to confound the
[1:04:49] wise and God has chosen the weak things
[1:04:51] of the world to confound the things
[1:04:53] which are Mighty I'd say you could take
[1:04:55] our our little bitty our little bitty
[1:04:58] Prophet out of the hills of Kentucky he
[1:05:00] was a bootlegger son and nobody ever
[1:05:02] expected him or had the foresight to
[1:05:05] ever think that he would have a Ministry
[1:05:07] that would be powerful enough that he
[1:05:09] would be a that he would go and preach
[1:05:11] and he would he would lay hands on Kings
[1:05:13] and potentates actually the the
[1:05:16] hierarchy of the day and the men that
[1:05:17] surrounded William brandham they told
[1:05:19] him that these visions that he was
[1:05:21] having that those things were of the
[1:05:22] devil and they told him not to touch
[1:05:24] those things to the church World
[1:05:26] couldn't understand who who what William
[1:05:28] brandham was they couldn't understand
[1:05:30] his gift they couldn't understand his
[1:05:32] ministry they could not believe that he
[1:05:34] had met an angel they could not
[1:05:36] understand how how that this Angelic
[1:05:38] being was inspiring him to take him from
[1:05:40] scripture to scripture and tie these
[1:05:42] things together but I I want you to know
[1:05:44] they didn't realize how how great this
[1:05:47] man was but if you'd asked the maniac
[1:05:49] from Portland he would have a different
[1:05:51] story because this man had come in
[1:05:53] contact with a with a man that had knew
[1:05:55] God and had handled God and he wasn't
[1:05:57] afraid to stand in the face of a of a
[1:06:00] Maniac in the midst when all other
[1:06:02] preachers was scared in the city here
[1:06:05] stood a man that should have been scared
[1:06:08] looking at the at the at the fragments
[1:06:10] of his body and looking at the build of
[1:06:12] his body he should have been scared of
[1:06:14] that man but the God that was on the
[1:06:16] inside of William brandham he could tell
[1:06:19] a different story that that Maniac had
[1:06:22] to lay his hand and lay his body on top
[1:06:25] of William pranom because he realized
[1:06:28] that Satan has to understand that the
[1:06:31] challenge that he's come up against that
[1:06:34] when Satan comes and you've got
[1:06:36] something that's worth contending for
[1:06:38] Satan's going to fight
[1:06:40] you I don't think it should surprise any
[1:06:43] any Christian that if you've got
[1:06:45] anything of your life that it that it's
[1:06:47] worth having then Satan's going to
[1:06:49] contend for it that's why that Maniac
[1:06:52] came against William brandham because he
[1:06:54] had something where contending for it
[1:06:57] the hierarchy of the church World
[1:06:59] couldn't stop it demons couldn't stop it
[1:07:01] because all of heaven was behind
[1:07:04] it that Maniac had a different story and
[1:07:07] Elijah Perry had a different story when
[1:07:09] William brand in there when when William
[1:07:11] brandham went in there to console the
[1:07:13] family when Elijah Perry had died from
[1:07:15] Hemes where he had bled out brother
[1:07:18] brandham just went in there to console
[1:07:20] the family and when William brandham
[1:07:22] consoled the family he walked out and he
[1:07:24] was walking out out and brother random
[1:07:26] said that Elijah Perry had blood all
[1:07:28] over his body where he had completely
[1:07:29] HED out and he felt a hand upon his
[1:07:32] shoulder and turned him around and he
[1:07:34] said when I come to myself he said I was
[1:07:36] on top of him he said I had blood all
[1:07:38] over myself he said and I was calling
[1:07:41] for Elijah's life to come back you talk
[1:07:44] about Elijah talking to Elijah right
[1:07:46] there that he's asking for life to come
[1:07:48] back and die on Dry Bones he's he's
[1:07:51] asking for it to come back I'd say
[1:07:53] Elijah Perry could tell a different
[1:07:54] story he was elected he was called he
[1:07:58] was anointed and he was placed back into
[1:08:00] life
[1:08:03] again we realize that when brother
[1:08:06] brandham comes into the adoption series
[1:08:09] he picks up that Ephesians chapter one
[1:08:11] and he said we are assembled in Heavenly
[1:08:14] places he said that means that's the
[1:08:16] position of the believer he said that if
[1:08:18] I'm prayed up and you're prayed up or
[1:08:20] the church has prayed up we're ready for
[1:08:21] the message and we've assembled
[1:08:23] ourselves together as Saints called out
[1:08:25] baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with
[1:08:28] God's blessings called elected set
[1:08:29] together in Heavenly places now we are
[1:08:32] heavenlies in our souls our Spirits has
[1:08:35] brought us into a Heavenly atmosphere he
[1:08:37] said oh brother there you are a Heavenly
[1:08:40] atmosphere you see the difference
[1:08:42] between between you and the rest of the
[1:08:45] world is that you are a Creator you you
[1:08:48] have something on the inside of you I'd
[1:08:50] say that that that heaven has done
[1:08:52] something on the inside of you that you
[1:08:55] have the the ability to be able to
[1:08:56] create and he goes on to say he said now
[1:08:59] oh what could happen tonight he said
[1:09:01] what could happen tonight if we would be
[1:09:03] sitting here in in Heavenly atmosphere
[1:09:05] and the Holy Spirit moving over every
[1:09:07] heart that's been regenerated and become
[1:09:09] a new creature in Christ Jesus I I would
[1:09:12] like to ask that question tonight what
[1:09:14] could happen here
[1:09:16] tonight what could happen here tonight
[1:09:18] because we realize that we're Heavenly
[1:09:19] in our souls that even though Satan
[1:09:22] might battle us in our flesh and might
[1:09:24] battle us in our spirit but we are
[1:09:26] Heavenly in our souls and we realize
[1:09:29] that as globally in that we are in a
[1:09:31] very pit moment that as you look at
[1:09:34] Warlords that are setting themselves up
[1:09:36] that are being set up like like Warlords
[1:09:39] that are going on with Israel and Iran
[1:09:41] of Russia and Ukraine and you look at
[1:09:43] the USA and she's she is flexing her
[1:09:46] muscles and you are watching demon
[1:09:49] powers as they are moving into position
[1:09:52] and we realize that when William
[1:09:53] brandham comes and he preaches recog
[1:09:55] izing your day and its message he said
[1:09:57] National Force put Israel back in her
[1:09:59] Homeland again he said but it will be
[1:10:02] the power of the Holy Ghost that will
[1:10:04] put the people in The Bride because
[1:10:07] Jesus said my word is spirit and but my
[1:10:10] word is spirit and his life he said so
[1:10:13] the word will put the bride in her
[1:10:16] position and all of this you say well
[1:10:19] what is all this message about brother
[1:10:21] Andrew it's to put Eve back in her
[1:10:24] position again
[1:10:26] it's to put her back the whole thing of
[1:10:29] Christ The Mystery of God revealed it's
[1:10:31] eve being placed back in her rightful
[1:10:34] position again it should take her back
[1:10:37] there that's exactly what the message of
[1:10:40] the hour has done it's restored you you
[1:10:43] might feel like you're living an
[1:10:45] ordinary life but you're not you might
[1:10:48] feel like you're just going through the
[1:10:49] motions but you're not you might feel
[1:10:52] like you're just listening to a tape but
[1:10:54] you're not you might feel like you're
[1:10:56] just going to another church service but
[1:10:58] you're not why because you are Heavenly
[1:11:01] in your soul and the message has
[1:11:03] restored you back you don't have to
[1:11:06] succumb to Satan's Antics and believe
[1:11:09] his lies because there is a restoration
[1:11:12] that has put a bride in position to
[1:11:14] enforce the claims of the god that wrote
[1:11:17] the
[1:11:20] word now in the Samaran Church age
[1:11:23] brother manam goes into galatian chapter
[1:11:25] 4 and I'm just going to lay some
[1:11:27] foundational things here he he says now
[1:11:31] comes our triumphal Capstone on the
[1:11:34] baptism with the Holy Ghost and he pulls
[1:11:37] up Galatians 4 and4 and he says but when
[1:11:39] the fullness of time was come God sent
[1:11:42] forth his Spirit or his God sent forth
[1:11:44] his son made of a woman made under the
[1:11:46] law to redeem them that were under the
[1:11:49] law that we might receive the adoption
[1:11:51] of sons because you are sons and because
[1:11:54] you are Sons Sons God sent forth the
[1:11:56] spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:11:59] crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no
[1:12:02] more a servant but a son and if a son
[1:12:05] then an heir of God through Christ he
[1:12:08] said there it is Jesus Christ came forth
[1:12:11] died upon the cross accomplished
[1:12:14] Redemption restoring to original owner
[1:12:17] by means of purchase or paying the price
[1:12:19] thereby plac us as Sons he did not make
[1:12:23] us Sons we for we are already Sons but
[1:12:27] he placed us as Sons for as long as we
[1:12:30] were in the world in the flesh we could
[1:12:32] not be recognized as his sons we were
[1:12:35] held captive by the devil but we were
[1:12:37] Sons nonetheless and hear this and
[1:12:40] because you are Sons God have sent forth
[1:12:43] his Spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:12:46] whereby you cry father father you see
[1:12:51] when you are saying that when a Jew is
[1:12:53] saying that it is the most intimate
[1:12:55] speech that a son can have to his father
[1:12:58] he is saying your heart is crying your
[1:13:01] spirit is crying you are my father my
[1:13:04] father he said upon whom did the Spirit
[1:13:07] fall at Pentecost Sons at Corinth whom
[1:13:11] who did it fall upon upon sons while
[1:13:14] they heard the word that's what the
[1:13:16] Bible said in Acts 10:44 that while the
[1:13:20] Peter yet spake these words the Holy
[1:13:22] Ghost fail the reason why the Holy Ghost
[1:13:25] most fell on them was because they were
[1:13:27] Sons they had the identity of a son they
[1:13:30] may not look like it like a son on the
[1:13:32] outside but their entire
[1:13:35] identity was a
[1:13:37] son I believe that one of the key
[1:13:39] message or the key features of the
[1:13:41] message I is it's placing the bride back
[1:13:45] in her position but I also believe that
[1:13:48] it's growing of Greater of Satan's
[1:13:49] greatest tactics is to steal the
[1:13:52] identity of the Church of the Living God
[1:13:54] and to Rob her of her position and to
[1:13:57] cause a spiritual Amnesia to come upon
[1:13:59] the Church of the Living God and steal
[1:14:01] her identity to make her forget who she
[1:14:04] is forget she's got power and forget
[1:14:06] that she's a son and daughter of
[1:14:08] almighty God I was I was reading just
[1:14:10] before we left before church about about
[1:14:13] a story and it's called the prince the
[1:14:15] princes of the towers and then there
[1:14:18] there was a king Edward I 6 I believe
[1:14:21] and he had he had two sons and he had a
[1:14:23] brother his name was Richard and I I
[1:14:26] believe they were in England and so
[1:14:27] anyways say Richard was Richard uh
[1:14:30] Richard was wanting a throne for himself
[1:14:33] and King Edward I 6 had passed away and
[1:14:35] he went and these boys were just 12
[1:14:37] years old so the King Richard he took
[1:14:40] and he he placed these two boys up in a
[1:14:43] tower and after a while after a while
[1:14:46] they they begin to lose their identity
[1:14:48] people actually started telling rumors
[1:14:50] that these boys were illegitimate even
[1:14:52] though they were the King's son and they
[1:14:54] they the end of the story was they they
[1:14:56] they thought that it still remains to be
[1:14:58] a mi a mystery because they don't even
[1:15:00] know what happened to them boys but this
[1:15:03] Uncle wanted the throne for himself so
[1:15:05] he took away their robes he took away
[1:15:07] the he took away their crowns he took
[1:15:09] away their identity you see you see you
[1:15:12] see you can take you can take just like
[1:15:15] just like Legion in the Bible what did
[1:15:18] Satan do he went in there and the first
[1:15:19] thing that he did he took away his
[1:15:21] identity he started robbing him of his
[1:15:23] clothes and gave him gave him devil
[1:15:25] clothes and what did he do he
[1:15:26] automatically displaced him he robbed
[1:15:29] him of his dresswear he began to scar
[1:15:31] him but when you see when the difference
[1:15:35] between the prince in towers and this
[1:15:37] man Legion was Legion came back to
[1:15:40] himself is that Jesus came in there and
[1:15:43] restored him back and notice when when
[1:15:47] Jesus restores the man he find you find
[1:15:50] him in the next picture he is sitting at
[1:15:53] the feet of the word you see the Bible
[1:15:56] said in Hosea 8 and4 they have set up
[1:15:58] Kings but not by me you see it's God's
[1:16:01] duty to place men in position not men
[1:16:06] that's why when Jesus is writing out
[1:16:08] Revelations chapter 1 he said he hath
[1:16:11] made us Kings and Priests so William
[1:16:14] brandham said salvation is his doing
[1:16:17] salvation is of the
[1:16:20] Lord ain't you thankful about that today
[1:16:23] that it ain't up to man to save you you
[1:16:25] it ain't up to William brandom to save
[1:16:27] you it ain't up to Ron Spencer to save
[1:16:29] you but Salvation is of the
[1:16:33] Lord ah come on now he said now all of
[1:16:36] Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he
[1:16:38] bought us for a purpose we are Kings
[1:16:41] spiritual Kings oh we are going to be
[1:16:43] Kings upon the Earth with him when he
[1:16:45] sits on his throne but now we are
[1:16:47] spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a
[1:16:50] spiritual Kingdom because the Bible said
[1:16:52] in Romans 5:1 17 for by one man's
[1:16:55] offense death reigned by one much more
[1:16:58] for they which received an abundance of
[1:17:01] Grace and of the gift of righteousness
[1:17:03] shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ
[1:17:07] also colos Colossians 1:3 who hath
[1:17:10] delivered us from the power of darkness
[1:17:13] and has translated us into the kingdom
[1:17:16] reign of his dear son so right now we
[1:17:20] reign with Christ having dominion over
[1:17:23] sin the World the Flesh and the devil
[1:17:25] showing forth his praise and glory
[1:17:28] showing forth himself for it is Christ
[1:17:30] in US willing and doing of his good
[1:17:32] pleasure yes indeed even now we are
[1:17:36] seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:17:39] Jesus you so what does that got to do
[1:17:42] with my ordinary life I'll say it like
[1:17:44] this that all the qualities that was in
[1:17:47] Jesus Christ is now in you if you are
[1:17:50] seated as a as a Bible believing
[1:17:53] Christian as d David was standing there
[1:17:56] as a typee of Christ when the anointing
[1:17:58] oil flowed over his life he was
[1:18:01] placed as
[1:18:06] King David went back to being a Shepherd
[1:18:09] but he was placed as a king you might go
[1:18:13] back to Wars in your mind but you're
[1:18:15] still placed as a king you might go
[1:18:17] through troubles but you're still placed
[1:18:19] as a King when he filled you with the
[1:18:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost you are still
[1:18:24] placed as a king if the enemy comes in
[1:18:27] like a flood you are still placed as a
[1:18:31] king when the weapon that the enemy has
[1:18:33] formed against you you are still placed
[1:18:36] as a king when your family leaves you
[1:18:39] you are placed as a king when your
[1:18:42] friends walk away from
[1:18:44] you you are placed as a
[1:18:48] king I say this God did not put you here
[1:18:51] to rain over lay Osa to let you fall in
[1:18:54] ruin
[1:18:55] but he placed you here to raise up and
[1:18:58] be the Victorious son of almighty
[1:19:01] God that's why I have the ability to say
[1:19:05] cancer take your leave that's why I have
[1:19:08] the ability to say Satan get underneath
[1:19:10] of my feet because I didn't put myself
[1:19:13] here he put me
[1:19:16] here come on Ron Spencer didn't put me
[1:19:20] here hmer Frasier didn't put me here but
[1:19:22] a king saw that I was worth saving so he
[1:19:26] saved me he filled me and he gave me a
[1:19:31] crown he crowned my life with the Holy
[1:19:42] Ghost and I tell you what David's one of
[1:19:45] my favorite
[1:19:46] characters there's some powerful about
[1:19:49] David there a lot of kids that were
[1:19:51] probably named David
[1:19:55] there's a probably a lot of kids that
[1:19:57] was 12 years old and they was probably
[1:19:59] Ruddy but there was something different
[1:20:01] about this
[1:20:03] boy that the Bible declares that he was
[1:20:05] a man after God's Own Heart he was a
[1:20:07] kind of guy that you couldn't look on
[1:20:09] his outside because the outside would
[1:20:11] fool him but on the inside it'll it'll
[1:20:15] shut down all kinds of things I say that
[1:20:18] that's what you got to look to you can't
[1:20:20] look to your flesh because your flesh is
[1:20:21] going to let you down you can't look to
[1:20:23] the things that are around you because
[1:20:25] those things are going to let you down
[1:20:26] there was something about David that
[1:20:28] made him think different that made him
[1:20:31] hear different that made him worship
[1:20:34] different I love studying out David's
[1:20:36] Che when he's back there in a Shepherd
[1:20:38] because I'll be I'll be honest that's
[1:20:40] where David learned to be a king at
[1:20:43] that's really where he learned to be a
[1:20:44] king at because he's writing out Psalms
[1:20:46] 22 he writes out Psalms 23 and he gets
[1:20:50] there in the face of
[1:20:52] fear and he doesn't buckle to it now the
[1:20:56] Bible said in Romans 10:1 17 that Faith
[1:20:58] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:20:59] word of God is that right so doubt is
[1:21:02] got to come the same way it's just you
[1:21:04] choose to listen to the wrong voice and
[1:21:07] David was back there by himself and I'd
[1:21:10] say that when you get by yourself
[1:21:12] there's a lot of things that'll start
[1:21:13] talking to you your mind will start
[1:21:15] talking to you your spirit will start
[1:21:17] talking to you and the enemy start
[1:21:19] talking to you you ain't got no friends
[1:21:21] you don't look lovely you don't look
[1:21:23] worthy you don't look big enough you're
[1:21:25] all out there by yourself but David
[1:21:27] chose not to listen to them voices David
[1:21:30] chose to give his power over to a
[1:21:33] kingship that he can
[1:21:36] see you see it's what voice you begin to
[1:21:39] Value because when you constantly are
[1:21:42] listening to fear and negativity and
[1:21:44] lies from the enemy you watch because
[1:21:47] you got good ground I just be real
[1:21:49] honest this this this this ground right
[1:21:52] here in Full Gospel Lighthouse it's good
[1:21:54] ground
[1:21:55] because if if you start preaching Faith
[1:21:57] to this good ground right here you'll
[1:21:59] watch Miracles start happening I'll I'll
[1:22:02] just be real honest with you you can say
[1:22:04] something to brother sanon and you let
[1:22:06] that seed fall in there you watch a
[1:22:07] miracle take
[1:22:09] place I I just say you could say it to
[1:22:11] brother Jerry because it's good ground
[1:22:13] and you let that seed fall in there and
[1:22:15] you watch a miracle take place why
[1:22:17] because it's good ground but if you are
[1:22:19] constantly listening to fear and
[1:22:21] constantly listening to well you're not
[1:22:23] good enough well God won't come through
[1:22:25] your prayers ain't going to change
[1:22:26] anything then doubt will begin to grow
[1:22:29] as quick as faith will if you'll begin
[1:22:31] to water that thing that's why I never
[1:22:34] listen to stupid
[1:22:37] people I I learned this a long time ago
[1:22:41] I you can't listen anything that the

[1:23:20] got faith in their mouth I choose to
[1:23:22] listen to people that's got courage in
[1:23:24] our mouth I choose to listen to people
[1:23:26] that want to praise God whether they
[1:23:28] want to praise God or not they still
[1:23:30] praise God I choose to have those kind
[1:23:32] of friends that want to worship when
[1:23:35] they shouldn't be worship I want to have
[1:23:37] them kind of friends that believe when

[1:24:24] take
[1:24:31] back Goliath's greatest weapon was his
[1:24:38] past his greatest weapon was his past
[1:24:41] but David's greatest weapon was not his
[1:24:44] P God Bless
[1:24:45] America David's greatest weapon was not
[1:24:49] his past but his
[1:24:52] future my past it's not my greatest

[1:25:03] eyes I was born to be a king I Was Born

[1:25:09] pastor's not my weapon but my future of
[1:25:13] Heaven is my goal the Rapture is for
[1:25:17] [Applause]
[1:25:22] me brother random say about salvation he
[1:25:26] said he would he would illustrate it
[1:25:28] like a little button he said now when
[1:25:30] you're saved he said it's like a little
[1:25:32] bitt of button on the inside of you and
[1:25:34] he said as you begin to grow that little
[1:25:36] button begins to grow and he said as it
[1:25:39] begins to grow it begins to crowd out it
[1:25:41] begins to crowd out unbelief and it
[1:25:42] begins to crowd out un unbelief and fear
[1:25:45] and anxiety i' say i' say it's time that
[1:25:48] you let that seed of life begin to grow
[1:25:50] on the inside of you let it come to life
[1:25:54] he's designed you with a purpose to live
[1:25:57] for
[1:25:59] him you realize that he's designed you
[1:26:03] to be a
[1:26:06] king even when you don't look like it
[1:26:09] even when you don't feel like it he
[1:26:11] designed you now you remember when
[1:26:13] William brandom starts telling that
[1:26:14] story I I hope I Ain't Got You disturbed
[1:26:17] by me throwing my tie off I I just
[1:26:19] forgive me please forgive me I wouldn't
[1:26:21] do anything to offend the holy ghost or
[1:26:23] anybody else here but you realize that
[1:26:26] brother man start talking about that
[1:26:28] preacher went to that mechanic his his
[1:26:30] his car got to acting up on him and he
[1:26:33] was he was got to I'm sorry don't worry
[1:26:37] about it I'll be okay and so remember
[1:26:40] that little mechanic he was there and he
[1:26:41] was working on that car and and all of a
[1:26:44] sudden that he he tried this and he
[1:26:46] tried that and finally a man brother man
[1:26:48] said a man stood up in there in a in a
[1:26:51] in a real nice suit and and he said now
[1:26:53] why don't you tried this Sunday he said
[1:26:55] instead of that old mechanic being
[1:26:56] arrogant all those things he he actually
[1:26:58] listen to him said well what do you what
[1:27:00] do you suggest and he starts taking his
[1:27:02] advice and he said try this and try that
[1:27:04] he started doing this and everything
[1:27:05] that he couldn't do started working
[1:27:07] together and he looked up at him and
[1:27:09] said now who are you he said well I'm
[1:27:12] the chief engineer I'm the guy that
[1:27:14] built that thing so God knows exactly
[1:27:16] what he put in you to make the Dynamics
[1:27:19] Roll Just in right in time that because
[1:27:22] he's designed you in such a way and
[1:27:23] brother man him said it like this he
[1:27:25] knows what it takes to put a church in a
[1:27:27] Rapture order he designed it and put the
[1:27:30] parts together here in the Bible so you
[1:27:32] are designed by the word of God so no
[1:27:36] matter what comes against you you're
[1:27:38] designed by the word of God no matter
[1:27:40] what the enemy says against you you are
[1:27:42] designed by the word of God because he's
[1:27:44] still Jehovah jahra that he can provide
[1:27:47] himself a church and whether people want
[1:27:49] to serve God or not God is still able to
[1:27:53] raise up stones from Abraham and to make
[1:27:56] them sons of God I find it amazing that
[1:27:59] Jesus is standing there and Jesus is
[1:28:01] standing there 16 chapters later in Luke
[1:28:03] and he comes there and he's facing the
[1:28:06] same guys that John the Baptist was
[1:28:08] facing when he's standing up there
[1:28:09] preaching that if you ain't going to
[1:28:10] serve God God will raise Stones up and
[1:28:13] when they come in there in Luke chapter
[1:28:15] 19 and they begin to scream Behold thy
[1:28:17] King cometh riding to you on the F the
[1:28:20] coold of an ass and they begin to bless
[1:28:22] His holy name and said he was the most
[1:28:24] high
[1:28:26] God they turned to him and said why
[1:28:28] don't you why don't you turn around and
[1:28:30] rebuke your disciples for saying these
[1:28:32] things he said now if they don't cry out
[1:28:36] then the stones is going to cry out and
[1:28:38] I say this like we were singing ain't no
[1:28:40] Rock going to cry in my place ain't no
[1:28:43] stone going to cry in my place because
[1:28:45] as long as I'm alive I'm going to sing
[1:28:48] because I was designed by almighty God
[1:28:51] to be somebody that would take the word
[1:28:53] of God and put it upon their lips they
[1:28:55] would take Revelations 10:7 they would
[1:28:58] be Revelations 10:8 they would go and
[1:29:00] take the little book that was not closed
[1:29:03] but it was open unto them and they would
[1:29:05] stand there under the prophecy of
[1:29:06] Revelations 10:11 and they would
[1:29:09] prophesy
[1:29:10] again I love what D when in Deuteronomy
[1:29:13] chapter 30 that when Moses starts lining
[1:29:16] out the Commandments that that now Moses
[1:29:20] now you Moses is a pretty profound guy
[1:29:22] even though he he say he's got
[1:29:23] stuttering problem
[1:29:24] he he's pretty profound he's got some
[1:29:26] Revelation from almighty God and he
[1:29:27] stands there and he said now he said
[1:29:29] this commandment I've given unto you it
[1:29:30] ain't up in heaven and he said it ain't
[1:29:32] underneath the Earth he said it's so
[1:29:34] close that the devil will miss it he
[1:29:37] said but it's not thee and it's even in
[1:29:39] thy
[1:29:41] mouth now turn with me to 1st Samuel uh
[1:29:45] 17-31 and and when the words were heard
[1:29:50] which David
[1:29:51] spake they rehearse him before for S now
[1:29:54] I think that right there is enough to
[1:29:56] preach rest of the night
[1:29:58] on that right there that they rehears
[1:30:02] them before Saul that David had done got
[1:30:04] so so loud in the
[1:30:07] mouth that everybody around started
[1:30:09] telling Saul about it that's my kind of
[1:30:12] testimony service right
[1:30:15] there this wasn't just some popcorn
[1:30:17] testimony but David had some gumption
[1:30:19] about him he started telling about how
[1:30:22] he he went in there and done all these
[1:30:23] things now let me read on before I get
[1:30:24] ah hit of myself and he sent for him and
[1:30:27] David said to Saul let no man's heart
[1:30:29] fail because of him thy servant will go
[1:30:31] and fight with this Philistine and Saul
[1:30:34] said to David thou are not able to go
[1:30:36] against this Philistine to fight with
[1:30:38] him for thou art but a youth and he's a
[1:30:40] man of war from his youth it sounds like
[1:30:43] a good guy to be talking don't it and
[1:30:45] David said un sa thy servant kept his
[1:30:48] father's sheep and there came a lion and
[1:30:49] a bear and took a took it out of his
[1:30:51] flock and I went out after him and I
[1:30:53] smoted him and I and I delivered it out
[1:30:55] of his mouth and when he arose against
[1:30:57] me I caught him by his beard and smote
[1:30:59] him and slew him my servant slew both
[1:31:02] the line and the A and this
[1:31:04] uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one
[1:31:07] of them seeing he ha defiled the armies
[1:31:09] of the Living God David said moreover
[1:31:12] the Lord that delivered me out of the
[1:31:14] Paw of the lion and out of the Paw of
[1:31:15] the bear he would deliver me out of the
[1:31:17] hand of this Philistine and Saul said
[1:31:20] unto David go and the Lord be with you
[1:31:25] now I I I'd like to just say if we could
[1:31:27] just let them rocks talk I I satting
[1:31:29] there and I was in my study and and a
[1:31:30] brother gave me one of them rocks that
[1:31:32] was over there in that little creek he
[1:31:35] could have got it from anywhere but I
[1:31:36] trust the guy so I'm going to say he got
[1:31:38] it out of that Creek so I was sitting
[1:31:40] there and I was looking at that thing
[1:31:41] you know I'd say them rocks was probably
[1:31:44] there probably 4,000 years ago when
[1:31:46] David was there if we get to talking to
[1:31:49] them rocks and looking at them you you'd
[1:31:51] say that that rock we could say he was
[1:31:54] elected he was called by David he was
[1:31:58] anointed when he when David dropped him
[1:31:59] in his script bag and brother bandam
[1:32:01] said he that that David was a shepherd
[1:32:03] and had that honey in there because he
[1:32:05] had that honey for when he when his
[1:32:07] sheep got sick and he when he when he
[1:32:09] pulled that thing out it had the
[1:32:10] anointing on it so he so you see he
[1:32:15] said that's beautiful man there some
[1:32:19] honey in that rock right
[1:32:20] there he he pulls that rock out of there
[1:32:24] and it's got some honey on it and it's
[1:32:26] here it is it's elected it's called it's
[1:32:28] anointed and it's getting ready to be
[1:32:30] placed in a place am and you know you if
[1:32:33] you can only realize your position like
[1:32:36] David realized his position that
[1:32:38] something could take place right here
[1:32:41] that the Goliath of cancer would have to
[1:32:43] shut its mouth because the Bible didn't
[1:32:45] say tomorrow we will be the sons of God
[1:32:48] but it says right now we're the sons of
[1:32:49] God Jesus said it in his word right now
[1:32:52] we are sons of God you ain't got to sit
[1:32:55] there and say well I got to figure out
[1:32:56] how in order I'm going to create this
[1:32:57] power there is something powerful about
[1:32:59] you you don't have to manufacure no
[1:33:02] power because the original birth of the
[1:33:04] Holy Ghost will reproduce Christ in you
[1:33:07] the hope of glory the same qualities
[1:33:10] that was in Christ is the same qualities
[1:33:12] that's in you you ain't got to
[1:33:14] manufacture
[1:33:16] nothing man said that he was over in
[1:33:19] them uh in India and he said I was
[1:33:22] watching them firew walkers he said
[1:33:24] there they was he said they is out there
[1:33:25] and he said they was out there
[1:33:26] worshiping their idols and they was
[1:33:28] dancing around and he said they stick
[1:33:29] all kinds of swords and different things
[1:33:30] to their lips and mouths and he's
[1:33:32] walking over him hot coals and he said
[1:33:34] he said and Pentecostal is getting like
[1:33:36] that he said they are tried he said
[1:33:38] because they're always trying to
[1:33:39] manufacture something he said but the
[1:33:41] difference between the Hebrew children
[1:33:43] and these guys he said they didn't
[1:33:45] manufacture it they just they didn't
[1:33:47] tempt the Lord they just stepped into it
[1:33:50] you see you don't have to manufacture a
[1:33:52] healing if it's in you to produce it you
[1:33:55] don't have to manufacture giving the
[1:33:57] Holy Ghost it's in you to give it you
[1:34:00] don't have to manufacture anything you
[1:34:02] see that's the reason why the church
[1:34:04] world is in its case right now is
[1:34:06] because they're producing bastard born
[1:34:08] children they ain't been with the mate
[1:34:10] they ain't got no life in it they can't
[1:34:12] keep to the same word and they're
[1:34:14] producing stillborn kids they ain't got
[1:34:17] no power they never had an experience
[1:34:19] with the Holy Ghost I say this that if
[1:34:22] your children ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:34:24] put them under this
[1:34:27] message put them under this message
[1:34:30] because what they are lacking is the
[1:34:32] essential oil that's been poured out in
[1:34:34] this generation by Malachi for under
[1:34:37] this ministry and it's placed us in a
[1:34:40] creation spot to create an atmosphere
[1:34:42] Where Eagles can be
[1:34:46] born David had the oil poured over him
[1:34:49] this woman of Grace has had the
[1:34:52] anointing oil poured over top of her and
[1:34:54] she is fully
[1:34:56] prepared to be
[1:34:58] restored right beside her
[1:35:03] King what are you saying brother Andrew
[1:35:05] I'm saying
[1:35:06] this that just like David begin to
[1:35:11] speak you got to
[1:35:13] speak that David literally begin to
[1:35:16] speak his victory before he ever saw
[1:35:20] Goliath all he heard was his voice
[1:35:25] that's all he heard now I want to ask
[1:35:27] you a question how many's heard that
[1:35:30] you're not good enough and you're not
[1:35:31] going to make a Rapture you heard the
[1:35:34] voice but you didn't see the spirit
[1:35:36] where it came from now you know good and
[1:35:38] well that that Spirit didn't come from
[1:35:40] God because he's never said in your word
[1:35:42] in his word that you're not good enough
[1:35:43] and you're not going to make the Rapture
[1:35:45] but he said very much contrary but David
[1:35:48] just kept hearing it and there was
[1:35:49] something different about this voice he
[1:35:51] he realized that that wasn't the The
[1:35:53] Voice voice of of a friend that wasn't a
[1:35:55] voice of of a comrade on his side but it
[1:35:58] was a voice from an enemy and I always
[1:36:01] wondered why in the world was David's
[1:36:04] brother so worked
[1:36:06] up I mean come on now I mean wouldn't
[1:36:10] you wouldn't you wouldn't you like to be
[1:36:11] identified as the as the the guy that
[1:36:14] your brother killed that big old
[1:36:17] giant ain't that crazy like I know good
[1:36:20] and well that brother Jerry's the kind
[1:36:21] of brother that if David David that's
[1:36:23] funny
[1:36:24] Davey walks out there and he he goes out
[1:36:26] there and slays that Jerry's not the
[1:36:28] kind of guy so
[1:36:30] you you knucklehead you should have been
[1:36:33] back there feeding the Sheep why'd you
[1:36:35] bring us this cornbread down here I know
[1:36:37] good and well Jerry ain't that kind of
[1:36:39] guy but Jerry's going to get behind him
[1:36:43] I always wonder why in the world people
[1:36:45] can't get behind the message of the hour
[1:36:46] we're brothers here I don't care if
[1:36:49] brother Ron gets it done I don't care if
[1:36:50] brother Tim gets it done I don't care if
[1:36:52] brother Donnie gets it done we're on the
[1:36:54] same side don't call us a bunch of
[1:36:57] Knuckleheads get behind
[1:37:00] us get behind us instead of sitting
[1:37:04] there say you can't do it you're too
[1:37:05] small you ain't good enough you ain't
[1:37:07] got enough armor you ain't got enough
[1:37:09] intellectual properties be able to do it
[1:37:11] get behind
[1:37:15] David I got behind I I I'll just be
[1:37:17] honest with you somebody probably
[1:37:19] crucify me over this but I'm just going
[1:37:20] to tell it anyway but yesterday I was at
[1:37:22] my daughter's basketball game and and I
[1:37:26] walked into the restroom and I was
[1:37:28] coming out and I was I was getting ready
[1:37:29] I was getting ready to exit out and
[1:37:33] uh as Spirit of the Lord dealt with me I
[1:37:35] actually thought I had to get myself
[1:37:37] together cuz I thought we was going to
[1:37:39] have one them
[1:37:40] meetings you know I just the spirit of
[1:37:43] the Lord got so
[1:37:46] real and I I began to think
[1:37:49] about the fan Factor
[1:37:54] that that if you ever you ever seen a a
[1:37:56] team that you know was going to
[1:38:00] lose oh
[1:38:04] Lord is this Full Gospel Lighthouse
[1:38:07] thought I'd done moved in the Church of
[1:38:08] Christ here for a
[1:38:11] minute but you ever you ever been I know
[1:38:14] good and well I was on that football
[1:38:15] team everybody showed up and they
[1:38:17] realized we was getting beat now the
[1:38:19] year before we won a whole lot cuz
[1:38:21] Matthew was on a team but when it was my
[1:38:24] turn the fans knew we were going to have
[1:38:26] a two and eight
[1:38:29] record they were impressed that we won
[1:38:31] two still going to still got a touchdown
[1:38:34] on Spotswood praise
[1:38:44] God let me get back to the serious part
[1:38:46] of what I was talking about but you you
[1:38:49] realize that when that's funny that
[1:38:53] that's funny some of y'all people ain't
[1:38:55] from here you don't understand but you
[1:38:58] people are from here you
[1:39:01] know it's a fan factor for sure you put
[1:39:04] for defiance and Spotswood High School
[1:39:06] together it's a fan Factor but I I
[1:39:09] satting there and the Lord started
[1:39:11] dealing with me on this you can crucify
[1:39:13] me if you want to or not but I I'll just
[1:39:15] be real honest it was a real sincere
[1:39:18] moment and I I begin to think that
[1:39:22] there's a whole lot of people that are
[1:39:23] sitting in the
[1:39:25] crowd and they was up there on that
[1:39:27] hill and they wasn't one person that
[1:39:30] walked down there with
[1:39:32] David it wasn't one person that was
[1:39:34] behind David Saul sent him out there on
[1:39:37] a death errand Saul wasn't even down
[1:39:40] there in the valley with
[1:39:42] it you can hear it in a crowd you can
[1:39:46] hear it in a crowd when they do not
[1:39:48] believe that their team is going to
[1:39:50] win I'll just be real honest with you
[1:39:53] you can hear it in a church service when
[1:39:56] when people don't feel like they're
[1:39:57] going to get anything they they they
[1:39:59] there's all of a sudden a fan Factor
[1:40:01] comes in and they don't realize that
[1:40:03] they're getting ready to win one of the
[1:40:04] greatest battles if you just if you just
[1:40:07] get in
[1:40:07] it and and David walked down in there
[1:40:11] completely alone to the naked eye there
[1:40:15] was nobody cheering David on but on the
[1:40:17] other side there was shouts on the other
[1:40:20] side there was screams on the other side
[1:40:22] there was shouts it that their God was
[1:40:26] now going to sit there and they were
[1:40:28] going to watch the Philistine God become
[1:40:31] the god of the
[1:40:32] Israelites there that side was screaming
[1:40:35] this side had no voice behind
[1:40:39] it but that's to the naked eye because
[1:40:43] if we can look up into the Heavenly
[1:40:45] banister there was an arrayment of
[1:40:48] angels that were gathered around when
[1:40:51] nobody else was with David the Angels
[1:40:53] was with David and when nobody walked
[1:40:56] down in the valley with David the
[1:40:58] anointing was on David when nobody was
[1:41:01] cheering David on the anointing was
[1:41:03] there when nobody believed that he could
[1:41:06] do
[1:41:08] it Hallelujah let me say this to you
[1:41:11] little bride whether anybody cheers you
[1:41:14] on or not run run run whether anybody
[1:41:19] says you can do it or not
[1:41:21] fight go
[1:41:24] you will win the battle if you believe
[1:41:29] it this message is enough if you believe
[1:41:33] it the Holy Ghost is enough if you
[1:41:36] believe
[1:41:37] [Applause]
[1:41:46] it
[1:41:49] David let's hang up some trophies real
[1:41:52] quick
[1:41:55] because when you've got anything as I
[1:41:58] said that's worth contending for the
[1:42:00] enemy is going to come for
[1:42:02] it and sometimes it might come from the
[1:42:05] voices that are close to you and
[1:42:09] sometimes it'll come from the voices of
[1:42:10] the other side because when you start
[1:42:12] studying out 2 Samuel chapter 5 that
[1:42:15] when David has placed as king that
[1:42:17] immediately the Philistines started to
[1:42:19] seek him out when he comes into his
[1:42:21] kingship the enemy comes in and when you
[1:42:24] are crowned with the Holy Ghost don't
[1:42:26] think you're getting off easy that's
[1:42:28] when the enem is coming after you but
[1:42:30] David is standing there said I hung up
[1:42:32] this when pornography said I wasn't
[1:42:35] going to defeat it I hung it up when a
[1:42:37] line came in there of depression I hung
[1:42:40] it up when all the enemies that came in
[1:42:43] to steal God's children away I hung that
[1:42:45] up there and I'll say this that he be to
[1:42:48] prophesy his victory before he ever saw
[1:42:52] it and the Bible of Jesus Christ is the
[1:42:54] same way taking Revelations 10:11 and
[1:42:57] Deuteronomy 13:14 and she's putting the
[1:43:00] word that is in her mouth and she's
[1:43:01] speaking it just like Isaiah 5355 and 11
[1:43:05] and the word is accomplishing what she
[1:43:08] says it's going to be she is beginning
[1:43:11] to prophesy that she's going to see
[1:43:13] Miracles that she is seeing Miracles
[1:43:15] that prodical are returning that healing
[1:43:17] is in our body that I will lay my hands
[1:43:19] on the sick and they shall recover she
[1:43:22] starts putting a word in her mouth and
[1:43:24] she starts believing
[1:43:29] it she starts
[1:43:32] valuing her own
[1:43:38] voice nobody else was saying
[1:43:41] this everybody else was saying it can't
[1:43:44] be
[1:43:45] done but this little David believed it
[1:43:49] could be done if he can take down a line
[1:43:52] he can take down a be surely he can take
[1:43:54] down a
[1:43:56] blasphemer come on some it's time that
[1:43:58] you shut Goliath's mouth once and for
[1:44:04] all imagine a court
[1:44:08] scene the judge is in his position the
[1:44:12] prosecutors in his def his position the
[1:44:14] defense attorneys in his
[1:44:16] position the jury's in its
[1:44:19] position and you you you sitting there
[1:44:22] and your
[1:44:24] watching and this criminal that is
[1:44:26] standing before the judge he's as guilty
[1:44:29] as guilty can
[1:44:31] be and the judge has the sentence in his
[1:44:34] hand and he has the verdict and he
[1:44:37] sentenced him to death and this criminal
[1:44:41] starts losing his ever loving mind he
[1:44:43] starts trying to manipulate the crowd he
[1:44:45] starts crying and anger and he starts
[1:44:46] screaming out and trying to trying to
[1:44:48] trying to prove that he's not guilty
[1:44:50] trying to scream all these things and
[1:44:53] the prosecutor stands up with the
[1:44:55] verdict in his hand and said look he's
[1:44:58] guilty he's guilty of these crimes he's
[1:45:01] guilty of these things I believe it the
[1:45:04] judges said it get him out of here and
[1:45:07] the BFFs walk in and they carry him out
[1:45:11] he's screaming all that time but he
[1:45:14] can't do nothing about it because the
[1:45:16] verdicts already been wrote so is a body
[1:45:19] of Jesus Christ the judg has already
[1:45:22] said it the cross has already proved it
[1:45:25] and this body of Jesus Christ is holding
[1:45:28] up the verdict in her hand and telling
[1:45:31] him it's over you will not manipulate me
[1:45:34] with fear no longer you will not try to
[1:45:36] curse me with anger no
[1:45:39] longer get out of
[1:45:42] here let me tell you what Jesus said in
[1:45:44] John 1611 the prince of this world is
[1:45:47] already
[1:45:48] judged he's already I want to say the
[1:45:51] thing that is cursing you is already
[1:45:53] been judged the thing that's tormenting
[1:45:56] you has already been judged and you have
[1:45:59] been positionally placed as a son and
[1:46:01] daughter of almighty
[1:46:04] God hold the verdict up it's over devil
[1:46:08] it's over devil it's over I'm telling
[1:46:11] you devil we're
[1:46:15] through come on somebody let the
[1:46:18] musicians come
[1:46:23] blessed be the name of the Lord most
[1:46:26] [Applause]
[1:46:36] high David didn't have
[1:46:38] anybody but he still
[1:46:42] one Jesus didn't have
[1:46:45] nobody but he still
[1:46:47] one me put it like this William Brandon
[1:46:50] didn't have no
[1:46:51] peers hey was nobody could Fellowship on
[1:46:53] the ministry that he was fellowshipping
[1:46:55] with there's a lot of Great Men and I've
[1:46:57] studied a lot of their context out but
[1:47:00] ain't none of them said they had a
[1:47:01] meeting with an angel in a
[1:47:03] cave there nobody that could fellowship
[1:47:06] with William brandom on the same level
[1:47:08] that he was
[1:47:09] in but I want to say this he ain't Alone
[1:47:16] nowall William brandham still
[1:47:18] W and you might feel like you're all
[1:47:21] alone and I want to bring this
[1:47:22] completely back around just now you are
[1:47:25] elected called anointed in place you
[1:47:28] ain't alone in this battle David was
[1:47:31] alone but you're not
[1:47:34] alone I'm going I'm going to finish this
[1:47:36] service with Ephesians chapter 2 and
[1:47:38] verse 5 if you have the passion
[1:47:40] translation I I I know it'd be a
[1:47:43] blessing to them we we've read over
[1:47:45] Ephesians 2 and 5 till we known it like
[1:47:48] the back of our hand but I I found this
[1:47:50] quite profound and the the passion it
[1:47:53] says even when we were dead and doomed
[1:47:55] in our many sins he United us into the
[1:48:01] very Life of Christ and saved us by his
[1:48:04] Wonderful Grace he raised us up with
[1:48:07] Christ the exalted one and we ascended
[1:48:10] with him into his glorious Perfection
[1:48:12] and authority of the Heavenly realm for
[1:48:15] we are now
[1:48:17] co-seeded as one with
[1:48:20] Christ throughout the coming ages
[1:48:23] we will be the visible display of the
[1:48:26] infinite Limitless Riches of the his
[1:48:29] grace and kindness which was showered
[1:48:32] Upon Us in Jesus Christ may God bless
[1:48:36] his word father we come before you Lord
[1:48:41] Jesus we extend our gratitude towards
[1:48:45] the heavens we express how grateful that
[1:48:48] we are that you have placed us in a
[1:48:50] position to realize Who We Are
[1:48:53] in the midst of Le oosa when we realize
[1:48:56] that the church world is naked she's
[1:48:58] miserable blind and she don't even know
[1:49:02] one but there's a body on Earth that she
[1:49:05] sees visibly that she's decorated in the
[1:49:08] grace of almighty God she's covered by
[1:49:11] the Limitless
[1:49:13] Grace and everything about her is
[1:49:16] decorated with the blood of Jesus
[1:49:19] Christ father I pray in these broken up
[1:49:23] words that you would make us aware that
[1:49:26] your presence is ever before us and that
[1:49:29] you will never leave us and you will
[1:49:31] never forsake us in our worst of Despair
[1:49:34] and in our greatest battles you are
[1:49:37] there and father maybe we don't
[1:49:41] understand why the crowd isn't behind us
[1:49:45] sometimes but may we never fail to
[1:49:48] recognize that the voice from the world
[1:49:51] that is unseen
[1:49:53] has already spoken our Victory so father
[1:49:56] we commit this service and these words
[1:49:58] into your hands in the name of Jesus God
[1:50:02] bless
