[54:11] we thank the lord for that good to see
[54:13] brother meadows here and the family with
[54:15] us this morning
[54:16] i was thinking about it this morning
[54:18] early and i thought
[54:19] you know now that home
[54:22] has a representative to step back this
[54:25] way
[54:28] you know sometimes we look at it as
[54:30] great morning when we lose one but we
[54:31] realize that
[54:32] that in a few days when that
[54:34] resurrection happens
[54:36] she'll walk down the walk
[54:40] and you come around the corner and you
[54:41] go i know her
[54:44] i know her amen
[54:47] hallelujah so we just are we thank you
[54:50] for those comments brother donnie
[54:52] i certainly felt the presence of the
[54:54] lord at that funeral and
[54:56] god knows how to aim so unction his word
[54:59] and so we're just
[55:01] we're we're thankful for that he's just
[55:03] really good to us
[55:06] last night when andrew spoke he's still
[55:08] jesus
[55:10] that sounds so simple but so profound
[55:13] and he's still jesus and he's the same
[55:16] yesterday
[55:17] and the same today and forever and his
[55:20] power
[55:21] does not diminish anything
[55:30] in that glorious amen we love the lord
[55:33] this morning
[55:34] and so good to see you and amen he's
[55:37] wonderful to us
[55:38] we i i've got something i want you to
[55:40] pray about and i
[55:41] i just don't know kind of what's going
[55:43] on i i have a
[55:45] i have brain scans and lung scans and
[55:48] all the kind of
[55:49] blood work and see every doctor i think
[55:52] in the neighborhood
[55:53] on november the 11th 11th
[55:57] november 11th is an important day
[56:00] in history november 11th has been an
[56:02] important day
[56:03] it's one of the days to worry that
[56:05] angels stopped the war
[56:07] and they still ain't figured out how
[56:09] that war stopped
[56:11] brother brahm said angels stopped it
[56:14] and so i'm looking at it as a day of
[56:17] armistice
[56:17] day or or a day to worry that it that
[56:21] cancer's going to realize it's got to
[56:22] leave
[56:25] and so i'm looking for some really good
[56:27] news and so
[56:29] we thank the lord for that
[56:36] you know brother branham said in this
[56:38] day that there would be limbs restored
[56:42] you know and sometimes we get caught in
[56:43] a certain avenue of a thought that
[56:46] well we'll see an arm or we'll see a leg
[56:48] or we'll see a deal
[56:49] and we in this year have seen a body
[56:53] destroyed
[56:57] and we've seen a body restored
[57:00] amen amen standing right in your pulpit
[57:05] and you saw it go we watched it go all
[57:07] the way down
[57:08] into july and watched it couldn't go i
[57:11] could did not work a day with the boys
[57:14] and then all of a sudden get a touch and
[57:16] from that point on
[57:18] never miss a day amen
[57:22] amen haven't missed a weekend since so
[57:25] amen that's even more
[57:26] important than that so we love you with
[57:28] all of our hearts this morning
[57:30] sorry to have you standing but i just
[57:31] want to read some scripture for you this
[57:34] evening if you will turn with me to
[57:36] psalms chapter 27 and verse 1.
[57:41] so good to have you in the house of the
[57:42] lord those that are listening in glad to
[57:45] have you here as well and i just think
[57:48] it's so wonderful that
[57:49] we have so many friends around the world
[57:51] and new friends that we
[57:54] understanding that we've got four new
[57:55] converts that have
[57:57] that have came in and one day we'll be
[57:59] able to tell you the story but
[58:02] we're certainly thankful for that and
[58:05] i think it's four different professors
[58:07] that have given their heart to the lord
[58:09] in getting baptized
[58:10] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[58:14] and what i'm being told is that
[58:17] this is being played and you'll like
[58:20] this brother
[58:21] in bluefield where brother
[58:24] gabriel went to school it's on
[58:28] seven different tvs there in the school
[58:31] they're watching this live
[58:34] and not only are they watching this live
[58:37] but there are some portuguese children
[58:39] that are young or college people that
[58:41] are there
[58:42] that don't comprehend english as well as
[58:45] they should
[58:46] and so it's being translated live
[58:49] in portuguese at that college as well
[58:53] and it's also going on in pennsylvania
[58:55] too and so
[58:56] in a college there and so
[59:03] if you trust me i'll use you like never
[59:06] before
[59:08] amen amen hallelujah
[59:13] i want to speak to you today and because
[59:16] this is your scriptures
[59:19] i want to speak to you on your
[59:20] identification
[59:22] you're identified for rapture
[59:27] that's your purpose i want you to think
[59:30] about that for a moment
[59:32] it's your purpose sister linda good to
[59:34] see you here
[59:35] amen of course sister joyce too but
[59:37] sister lin had been sick
[59:39] we're glad to have her back psalms
[59:41] chapter 27 and if you
[59:43] remember this this is where brother
[59:44] branham took his text for the rapture
[59:49] the lord is my light and my salvation
[59:51] whom shall i fear
[59:53] the lord is the strength of my life of
[59:55] whom shall i be afraid
[59:57] when the wicked even mine enemies and my
[59:59] foes came upon me to eat my flesh
[1:00:02] they stumbled and fell and
[1:00:05] host should camp against me my heart
[1:00:08] shall not fear
[1:00:09] the war should rise against me and this
[1:00:12] will i be confident one thing that i
[1:00:14] have desired of the lord that i will
[1:00:17] that will i seek after that i may dwell
[1:00:19] in the house of the lord
[1:00:21] all the days of my life to behold the
[1:00:23] beauty of the lord
[1:00:24] and to inquire in his temple for in the
[1:00:27] time of trouble
[1:00:29] boy we've got that now for in the time
[1:00:32] of trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:00:34] pavilion
[1:00:35] and in the secret of his tabernacle
[1:00:37] shall he hide me and he shall set me up
[1:00:39] on a rock
[1:00:40] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[1:00:43] my enemies round about me
[1:00:45] therefore will i offer in his tabernacle
[1:00:48] sacrifices of joy
[1:00:50] i will saying yea i will sing
[1:00:53] praises unto the lord you may be seated
[1:00:57] and may the lord bless the reading of
[1:00:58] his word today
[1:01:05] in the sermon identification
[1:01:09] this was the text that brother branham
[1:01:11] would use he said let this mind be in
[1:01:13] you
[1:01:14] which was also in christ jesus and
[1:01:17] that's enough to preach for
[1:01:18] a year let this mind be in you
[1:01:22] which was also in christ jesus
[1:01:26] who being in the form of god thought it
[1:01:28] not robbery to be equal with god
[1:01:31] but made himself of no reputation and
[1:01:34] took upon him
[1:01:36] the form of a servant that was made in
[1:01:38] the likeness of man and being found in
[1:01:41] the fashion as a man
[1:01:42] he humbled himself and became obedient
[1:01:45] unto death even the death of the cross
[1:01:48] wherefore god hath also highly exalted
[1:01:52] and given him a name
[1:01:54] which is above every name
[1:01:57] and that's through all time
[1:02:00] caesar's not above him
[1:02:03] augustus is not above him alexander's
[1:02:07] not above him
[1:02:08] pharaoh's not above him
[1:02:11] whatever whatever presidents that is
[1:02:14] elected this week
[1:02:15] is not above him
[1:02:18] are you with me now that at the name of
[1:02:22] jesus
[1:02:24] every knee should bow of things that are
[1:02:27] in heaven
[1:02:28] and things in earth and things
[1:02:30] underneath the earth
[1:02:32] and every tongue should confess
[1:02:36] that jesus is christ the lord
[1:02:39] the glory of our father
[1:02:44] in the trial brother branham makes this
[1:02:46] statement he says
[1:02:48] though we be alienated
[1:02:51] though we're in a dark world of unbelief
[1:02:55] and sorrow and sickness and death
[1:02:59] yet he said let's
[1:03:03] act like sons and daughters of god
[1:03:05] that's quite a statement didn't it
[1:03:08] we are sons and daughters of god of the
[1:03:11] king
[1:03:13] it ought to change our
[1:03:16] attitude everything no matter what the
[1:03:20] rest of the world
[1:03:21] is we must hold on to the rights of
[1:03:24] god we remember that this is
[1:03:28] not our home
[1:03:31] these are some profound words now this
[1:03:34] is
[1:03:34] not our home and we're not of this
[1:03:37] country
[1:03:40] we're not of this world
[1:03:43] we're born of the spirit of god
[1:03:47] which is above
[1:03:50] now remember when god said let there be
[1:03:53] let there be let there be
[1:03:55] it's not an evolving end to that's what
[1:03:58] it is
[1:04:00] are you with me now he said if you would
[1:04:02] ask me for a tree i'd give you
[1:04:04] an oak tree i'd give you an acorn it has
[1:04:07] the potential in it
[1:04:09] it's not going to produce pine it's
[1:04:11] going to produce an oak tree
[1:04:15] are you with me every seed
[1:04:18] produces of its kind
[1:04:22] now man comes along and through genetic
[1:04:25] manipulation
[1:04:27] has destroyed a lot of things
[1:04:30] and they've done that with the word of
[1:04:32] god
[1:04:33] that's why there's 40 000 denominations
[1:04:36] or thoughts or opinions
[1:04:38] but god's words never change god's an
[1:04:41] unchanging god
[1:04:44] when god said let there be grass green
[1:04:47] grass
[1:04:49] he could have said it let it be purple
[1:04:52] and that's the way it would be even
[1:04:54] today
[1:04:56] that grass does not have to try to be
[1:04:59] something else
[1:05:00] it is exactly what it is seeds of
[1:05:04] reproduction many of you look in the
[1:05:07] mirror and as you get older you see your
[1:05:10] father
[1:05:10] you see your mother i was standing in
[1:05:14] front of the mirror the other day and i
[1:05:16] i looked there and i i thought there's
[1:05:19] my dad
[1:05:24] i heard somebody the other day say you
[1:05:26] look more like your dad
[1:05:27] and i thought that's a compliment
[1:05:31] that's a compliment i i think we should
[1:05:34] look
[1:05:34] like our father and i as i just kind of
[1:05:38] uh
[1:05:39] thought on those things over the last
[1:05:41] couple of weeks i thought
[1:05:42] i hope i look like my heavenly father
[1:05:52] you see it was god's placing of a germ
[1:05:54] of wheat
[1:05:56] and even in that germ of weed he
[1:05:58] identifies it has certain
[1:06:00] characteristics inside of it
[1:06:02] that produces what it is men have tried
[1:06:06] to reproduce a hand
[1:06:08] but that hand i want you to just look at
[1:06:10] your hand now
[1:06:11] god produced that hand for you that hand
[1:06:15] works
[1:06:16] that hand has strength that hand can
[1:06:18] grip
[1:06:20] that hand can feel that hand can show
[1:06:23] tenderness and kindness
[1:06:27] it can show also it can show the
[1:06:31] strength of a
[1:06:32] father or the strength of a mother
[1:06:36] it can show to a a baby's bottom
[1:06:44] that you love it
[1:06:48] while the baby goes daddy mama please
[1:06:50] don't do that don't then we're going
[1:06:52] it's hurting me more than
[1:06:54] i always wondered about that
[1:06:59] but you see god made that hand
[1:07:02] man in his great knowledge cannot
[1:07:05] produce
[1:07:05] that in
[1:07:08] in all the schools of the world they
[1:07:10] can't reproduce one
[1:07:12] that works and feels and touches and and
[1:07:15] can do
[1:07:16] everything that that can do because god
[1:07:18] made it
[1:07:20] and he made it in his own image
[1:07:23] hallelujah are you with me now
[1:07:27] now in god making your hand every one of
[1:07:30] us would have fingertips
[1:07:34] and it would have identification markers
[1:07:36] even on your fingers
[1:07:39] and you can you can be identified by
[1:07:42] your fingers
[1:07:43] you can also be identified by your eyes
[1:07:46] nobody's got eye prints exactly like you
[1:07:50] you see you can go through the whole
[1:07:51] world and i hear
[1:07:53] i have seen people that look exactly
[1:07:56] like another person
[1:07:57] brother ray lambert has a twin and
[1:07:59] brother harold hildebrandt's church
[1:08:01] brother ed head of hammer meister's
[1:08:03] church
[1:08:03] and he has an absolute twin and i shake
[1:08:06] his hand and
[1:08:07] and i tell him your twins doing real
[1:08:09] well
[1:08:12] but their fingerprints are not alike
[1:08:15] their eyes are not alike you see god
[1:08:18] builds us
[1:08:19] as an individual so different
[1:08:22] and in the infinite sea of god's mind
[1:08:26] god chose you and built you
[1:08:29] and knew how tall you'd be and what
[1:08:31] you'd be like
[1:08:32] and even through the fall what your
[1:08:35] weaknesses would be
[1:08:36] and the strains of your humanity but you
[1:08:39] see
[1:08:40] god chose you you didn't choose god
[1:08:45] are you with me you wasn't looking for
[1:08:47] god you were making decisions going the
[1:08:50] other way
[1:08:51] but god rich in his mercy came
[1:08:54] after you and you have may have run for
[1:08:58] decades and you may have run for years
[1:09:01] you may still be on the run you may
[1:09:04] still be doing your own thing in life
[1:09:06] and think well i'm getting by but
[1:09:07] well god will one day find you
[1:09:11] he knows how to get a hold to you
[1:09:14] you say well brother run but i've made
[1:09:16] so many mistakes and i continue to make
[1:09:18] mistakes and i continue to fail
[1:09:21] and i'm so embarrassed about even my
[1:09:23] savior amount myself
[1:09:25] let me just remind you god loves to
[1:09:28] abolish
[1:09:32] sin
[1:09:34] did you catch that god loves to destroy
[1:09:37] sin he loves to take his
[1:09:41] blood
[1:09:45] oh we ought to be shouting about right
[1:09:47] now
[1:09:48] because when you were born your
[1:09:50] forefathers all of their sins
[1:09:52] fell down on your little sweet humanity
[1:09:56] and though you be so sweet and so kind
[1:09:59] and charlie
[1:10:00] doesn't make any hardly anything that
[1:10:03] would make you mad
[1:10:05] but you passed your weaknesses of
[1:10:07] humanity
[1:10:08] down to him brother nathanael sister
[1:10:11] caitlin
[1:10:11] passed through that through the
[1:10:13] chromosomes past
[1:10:15] weaknesses on him
[1:10:18] but there's a blood of jesus christ
[1:10:23] that can break the chains of sin
[1:10:31] and you don't have to stay alienated
[1:10:33] from the commonwealth of god
[1:10:36] oh but i was a sinner let me just say
[1:10:38] this to you
[1:10:39] you always was a son of god
[1:10:42] you just acted like a sinner you just
[1:10:45] had a lot of bad habits
[1:10:46] there was a lot of things stowed on you
[1:10:49] but you never was
[1:10:51] you never was a pig you always
[1:10:55] was a sheep
[1:10:59] oh glory
[1:11:01] [Applause]
[1:11:10] hallelujah
[1:11:15] no i think it's sometimes fitting some
[1:11:16] of the things that people brings to us
[1:11:20] and they they don't know that they're
[1:11:22] doing just exactly the right things
[1:11:25] but god leads them brother denny brought
[1:11:28] us
[1:11:29] a you would be very aware of what this
[1:11:32] is it's a seal from the railroad
[1:11:36] and he didn't go chop it off no railroad
[1:11:38] nowhere but
[1:11:41] these are railroad seals
[1:11:44] and they're old and he brought
[1:11:47] brought a few of us a seal well
[1:11:52] the seal is very important in the
[1:11:54] message
[1:11:56] brother branham talks about the
[1:11:58] inspector
[1:12:01] and an inspector's got an important job
[1:12:03] he goes inside of the railroad car
[1:12:06] and he checks it and makes sure that
[1:12:08] it's packed right
[1:12:10] now if it would be dry pack he would go
[1:12:12] in and make sure that
[1:12:14] everything is tied in exactly right
[1:12:17] and he would make sure and not just to
[1:12:19] make it look good on the
[1:12:21] you know just to just to make it look
[1:12:23] make it l as it's stacked right
[1:12:25] but it has to be it has to be held down
[1:12:28] and
[1:12:29] and it has to be tied down right it has
[1:12:31] to have the chains in the right place
[1:12:33] and
[1:12:33] the board's in the right place because
[1:12:36] it's got a journey
[1:12:38] that's got to be made and it may be
[1:12:41] hundreds of miles or even
[1:12:42] thousands of miles or even maybe
[1:12:45] transported even
[1:12:46] overseas and you see
[1:12:49] once he gets done
[1:12:52] he identifies himself with that boxcar
[1:12:56] and not only does he put a seal on it
[1:12:59] but that seal also has a
[1:13:01] has a signature that goes with the
[1:13:03] paperwork with the number of that seal
[1:13:06] i can attest that this boxcar
[1:13:10] is ready for the journey because when it
[1:13:13] goes down the
[1:13:14] goes down the railway there's going to
[1:13:16] come some shaking
[1:13:21] there's going to be some turbulence
[1:13:23] along the way
[1:13:25] and i've made a seal that they're going
[1:13:27] to make it through the journey
[1:13:32] are you with me now that's why you got
[1:13:34] to have the holy ghost
[1:13:36] where things get tied down right in your
[1:13:39] life
[1:13:41] are you with me because cause god can't
[1:13:44] live in a contaminated vessel
[1:13:46] and so there's certain things that's got
[1:13:48] to come out of your life
[1:13:50] and you got to tell it i'm not putting
[1:13:52] up with that no more
[1:13:53] god help me cleanse me from this thing
[1:13:55] in my life
[1:13:56] and as it comes up
[1:14:00] because we've got a journey to make and
[1:14:02] that journey is for rapture
[1:14:05] there's a destination that goes with
[1:14:07] that seal
[1:14:10] are you with me and let me just say it's
[1:14:12] a phenomenal find to break the seal
[1:14:21] many many years ago
[1:14:24] i had the job of putting making sure
[1:14:27] that trucks were packed right
[1:14:30] with what they call desiccators which
[1:14:32] are large
[1:14:33] large containers
[1:14:38] of lava nitroglycerin and
[1:14:42] we would use a product to
[1:14:45] to stabilize it then we
[1:14:48] put it in tractor trailers or trucks
[1:14:52] or even box cars and put it in there and
[1:14:54] we had certain
[1:14:55] we had certain standard barriers that we
[1:14:57] put in around it
[1:14:59] held it and each each container held
[1:15:03] 1500 pounds of nitroglycerin which is
[1:15:07] basically looks like
[1:15:08] stem milk with a product in it to keep
[1:15:11] it stabilized but yet you don't want to
[1:15:13] play with that
[1:15:16] and so you'd place that in just right
[1:15:18] you'd make sure it's just right
[1:15:22] because there might come an accident
[1:15:26] because you're driving down the
[1:15:27] interstate and some of them are hauling
[1:15:29] hey
[1:15:32] some are hauling paper cups some are
[1:15:35] hauling steel beams some are hauling
[1:15:38] plywood
[1:15:40] but some of those trucks are hauling
[1:15:42] atomic weapons
[1:15:46] you better hope that the guy that put
[1:15:48] the seal on
[1:15:52] wasn't in a hurry to go get his coffee
[1:15:57] and so many times there's too many
[1:15:59] churches want to put a seal on
[1:16:06] and say oh this is rapture material when
[1:16:09] you're steel
[1:16:15] are you with me and you can list the
[1:16:17] sins
[1:16:19] and it's just simply unbelief
[1:16:22] listen sin is only unbelief
[1:16:28] why do people do what they do they don't
[1:16:29] believe
[1:16:32] well brother ron why is this dre why is
[1:16:34] this one dressed this way why was this
[1:16:36] one do this
[1:16:38] you know the internet's put stuff out
[1:16:40] now that people just
[1:16:43] you wonder why that they would put their
[1:16:45] picture like that
[1:16:47] but they're really telling what's on the
[1:16:49] inside of them
[1:16:50] why i'm not ready for the rapture
[1:16:56] and listen and listen let me just say
[1:16:58] this to you
[1:16:59] brother frazier many years would stand
[1:17:01] here one of his
[1:17:02] how many remembers his statement your
[1:17:04] sins will find you out
[1:17:07] how many remember he said he said
[1:17:12] your sins will find you out god has a
[1:17:15] law
[1:17:16] that you can't go through this life
[1:17:20] what you do in secret will be brought to
[1:17:23] light
[1:17:26] and you think well i'm getting by with
[1:17:27] tonight don't kid yourself
[1:17:30] it's only an attribute of unbelief let
[1:17:33] me just say if you really believed you
[1:17:35] do something about it
[1:17:39] someone sent me a note last night said
[1:17:40] pray for me i'm just anxious
[1:17:43] i have all kind of anxiety and you know
[1:17:45] pray for me and
[1:17:46] you had a good list of stuff today and i
[1:17:49] simply sent them a note
[1:17:52] do what you need to do
[1:17:56] well brother on that's pretty cruel
[1:17:58] before you can get a seal
[1:18:04] i can't do it for you i'll bow on my
[1:18:07] knees and pray for you
[1:18:12] you got to do what you got to do
[1:18:15] i can't pray for you i can't live right
[1:18:18] for you
[1:18:20] you got it somebody help me preach right
[1:18:22] don't get clapped but
[1:18:23] i'm only getting started
[1:18:31] i'm only getting started i'm not going
[1:18:32] to give you a 40 minute version today
[1:18:34] we're going to be here
[1:18:38] satan's been giving me a hard time i'm
[1:18:40] getting ready to give him a real hard
[1:18:41] time
[1:18:47] so i'm going to preach to you and give
[1:18:48] you a rib eye
[1:18:50] salad sweet potato
[1:18:56] apple pie and ice cream
[1:18:59] with a cherry on top and you can drink
[1:19:02] sweet tea and
[1:19:04] coffee if you want to we're going to
[1:19:06] burn the devil's head for
[1:19:08] a little bit cause we're identified for
[1:19:11] [Applause]
[1:19:20] rapture
[1:19:25] i've heard people say that well
[1:19:28] preachers are just legalists
[1:19:32] they didn't like brother branham because
[1:19:34] of they wanted him to not preach on
[1:19:36] women
[1:19:39] now he is the messenger identified
[1:19:44] we're talking about identification for
[1:19:45] rapture
[1:19:47] let me just let me just stop here just
[1:19:49] for a moment moses had a job
[1:19:52] and his job was to get people across in
[1:19:55] an ark
[1:19:58] okay build an ark
[1:20:02] and he worked 120 years and he preached
[1:20:05] that 120 years
[1:20:07] he was the designated germ seed of
[1:20:11] life to preach a message
[1:20:15] and though it seemed to tarry
[1:20:20] the vision would come to pass
[1:20:24] and there was nothing that satan could
[1:20:27] do
[1:20:27] to stop
[1:20:30] when the bellows of the deep opened up
[1:20:33] and the heavens opened up
[1:20:35] listen those people outside of the ark
[1:20:39] became believers
[1:20:45] that old man was a foggy that old man
[1:20:47] was a lot of different things they made
[1:20:49] a lot of fun of him
[1:20:51] but today he was god's messenger
[1:20:54] let us in
[1:20:59] but you notice it wasn't noah's message
[1:21:01] it was
[1:21:02] god's message
[1:21:07] god sent a man out of a desert named
[1:21:10] moses as a one-man invasion to go to the
[1:21:13] mightiest army
[1:21:14] the mightiest political power the
[1:21:17] richest nation
[1:21:20] and to command them to let my people go
[1:21:24] and sitting there with his raised up
[1:21:27] in him eye to eye
[1:21:34] moses walked in there and told him let
[1:21:37] god's people go
[1:21:40] 40 years had separated their fellowship
[1:21:44] and now moses didn't look like the moses
[1:21:47] that left
[1:21:48] moses didn't talk like the moses that
[1:21:50] left
[1:21:51] he didn't carry himself with the royalty
[1:21:53] that he left
[1:21:54] but he had been in the presence of god
[1:21:57] and he had a message
[1:22:01] it didn't matter that none of those
[1:22:03] egyptians
[1:22:05] believed him or not those jews were
[1:22:08] leaving
[1:22:12] they were identified for our exodus out
[1:22:15] of there
[1:22:16] listen they've been there for 400 years
[1:22:19] with a promise
[1:22:20] that they're coming out but this
[1:22:22] generation
[1:22:24] was identified for exodus
[1:22:29] and the slaves they were being whipped
[1:22:32] and they were being tortured
[1:22:33] but they were identified for an exodus
[1:22:43] but neither could moses preach noah's
[1:22:46] message
[1:22:47] and noah couldn't preach moses's message
[1:23:02] when brother branham comes he has a
[1:23:04] message
[1:23:08] now you know some people want to pick
[1:23:10] apart brother branham
[1:23:15] and they want to make a whole matter of
[1:23:16] fun of his humanity
[1:23:18] i'm going to go some places right here
[1:23:23] you see god builds a man and fits him
[1:23:25] for the nature of the people
[1:23:29] so here god brings a man from literally
[1:23:32] the backwoods of kentucky
[1:23:36] with a with the ability
[1:23:41] to storytell to where it made you feel
[1:23:45] like you were there
[1:23:50] give me some levity now
[1:23:53] how many of you feel like that when
[1:23:55] brother branham picks up an apple off of
[1:23:57] the ground
[1:23:58] and an infidel is sitting on the porch
[1:24:00] you feel like you've been to that house
[1:24:05] and brother brown's spinning that apple
[1:24:07] in his hands and he and the man's
[1:24:08] telling him said yellow jackets done eat
[1:24:10] them up i have what you want
[1:24:13] and then he turns and looks at a post
[1:24:15] and he talks to him about the law of
[1:24:18] nature
[1:24:20] you know the sap's leaving that tree let
[1:24:22] me just set a a couple water there
[1:24:26] when it when it goes down said will will
[1:24:29] the water and that go back down that
[1:24:31] post no
[1:24:32] well what what intelligence tells that
[1:24:34] tree
[1:24:36] you're telling me there's no god but
[1:24:38] what intelligence tells that tree
[1:24:44] it's kind of like you look out here this
[1:24:46] is god's great
[1:24:48] artwork what intelligence tells those
[1:24:52] trees
[1:24:54] that was green and beautiful only uh
[1:24:56] maybe 60 days ago
[1:24:58] now some of them are red some of them
[1:24:59] yellow some of them are
[1:25:01] all different colors and it just works
[1:25:07] listen you can do what you want to you
[1:25:09] can stand on the edge of this parking
[1:25:11] lot
[1:25:12] and say winter don't come
[1:25:16] don't come i hate snow don't come i hate
[1:25:18] ice
[1:25:19] don't come i don't want below 40 degrees
[1:25:22] don't come but i don't like
[1:25:23] zero weather you can stand there all you
[1:25:26] want to
[1:25:26] you can't stop it
[1:25:31] are you with me the flood was coming you
[1:25:34] couldn't stop it
[1:25:36] the exodus was coming you couldn't stop
[1:25:38] it
[1:25:40] jesus was coming you couldn't stop it
[1:25:51] brother branham was standing there and
[1:25:54] he had a unique gift and it was the son
[1:25:58] of man on display in this age
[1:26:01] and god was embodying a prophet to
[1:26:04] to stand there
[1:26:22] some of this is as fresh to me as it is
[1:26:23] to you too and i'm just
[1:26:25] i'm enjoying this as much as you are
[1:26:30] but i'm not i want you to just watch
[1:26:32] this i really didn't know where this
[1:26:33] quote would fit in but here it is
[1:26:36] he says now i'm going to pray for you
[1:26:40] the bible says that the prayer of faith
[1:26:43] shall save the sick
[1:26:46] and god shall raise them up
[1:26:52] and if i have found grace in your sight
[1:26:54] by the working of the holy spirit
[1:26:56] i'll pray with all my heart right now
[1:26:59] that the holy spirit will witness to you
[1:27:03] that the work is finished
[1:27:07] oh god my father i come in jesus name
[1:27:10] to pray for this people
[1:27:14] who has now honestly and sincerely
[1:27:17] have confessed their wrongs oh blessed
[1:27:21] god made
[1:27:22] this be a night that they'll never
[1:27:25] forget
[1:27:27] may the holy spirit come in every heart
[1:27:30] just now
[1:27:31] and move out all everything and all the
[1:27:35] sickness from their body
[1:27:37] now watch what he does now i now
[1:27:39] challenge the devil to a debate
[1:27:46] you ever heard john hagee do that
[1:27:50] you're probably not listening to him but
[1:27:52] i guarantee you've never done it
[1:27:56] now watch these next words satan
[1:28:00] you are aware that you're whipped
[1:28:06] [Laughter]

[1:28:14] brother adam's going to identify him
[1:28:15] and he's going to tell him exactly where
[1:28:17] he's at
[1:28:19] your identification tells you exactly
[1:28:21] where you're at
[1:28:26] let me just stop there just a moment he
[1:28:28] said brother ron why did you make those
[1:28:29] statements about the internet just a few
[1:28:31] moments ago
[1:28:34] i was only trying to catch you up to the
[1:28:36] identification
[1:28:37] that god knows everything about you
[1:28:44] i just read an article the other day
[1:28:47] that now it's going to
[1:28:49] trend is going to be that they're going
[1:28:52] to search
[1:28:53] your internet and all of your behavioral
[1:28:56] practices
[1:28:57] to know who you are and they can know
[1:29:00] who you

[1:29:09] i like that i like that
[1:29:12] and you may like somebody a a naked
[1:29:15] woman in a bathtub
[1:29:18] with a whiskey jug in her hand and you
[1:29:21] like that
[1:29:25] some hollywood star and you dislike that

[1:29:50] characteristics so they put him on a
[1:29:52] horse
[1:29:52] and he held a cigarette in his hand and

[1:29:56] had to go back and apologize to his
[1:29:59] children and his grandchildren don't

[1:30:44] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:30:48] i've got to hold to something i'm not

[1:30:52] to be identified with
[1:31:23] to make a rapture you're gonna have a
[1:31:28] seal
[1:31:30] and not everybody in this building's got
[1:31:32] a sale
[1:31:35] i'm not judging you you're judging you
[1:31:41] you're judging you your life is telling
[1:31:44] you what you are
[1:31:46] now the holy ghost will brood over your
[1:31:49] life
[1:31:50] let me just share this with you people
[1:31:52] will walk out of this church or churches
[1:31:54] around the world
[1:31:55] and they'll think they'll think that
[1:31:57] they're going and getting by with it
[1:31:59] but every once in a while the spirit of
[1:32:01] god will come back
[1:32:03] and haunt their soul because they've
[1:32:06] grieved their soul away
[1:32:08] listen if you grieve god away
[1:32:12] he will hey he's preaching today
[1:32:17] he will come and haunt you and you'll
[1:32:20] feel conviction
[1:32:21] and and it'll stay there for a few days
[1:32:24] and you'll want to get back
[1:32:26] in church or maybe even come for a month
[1:32:27] or two and then
[1:32:29] right back in the world again and you'll
[1:32:31] cycle and cycle and cycle
[1:32:33] it's because they grieve their soul away
[1:32:36] they had a chance to repent
[1:32:40] listen brother ron that's wrong let me
[1:32:42] just say
[1:32:43] cain was given a chance to repent
[1:32:50] god told cain serpent seed
[1:32:55] do is your brother and you'll be
[1:32:57] forgiven
[1:33:00] you've accepted your sacrifice
[1:33:05] but he refused to repent america is at
[1:33:08] that point
[1:33:13] america is at the point
[1:33:16] they have refused to repent
[1:33:25] tuesday they'll prove it
[1:33:31] don't get nervous about it
[1:33:42] don't you wish you had one
[1:33:54] you notice the other day we had a
[1:33:55] supreme court judge
[1:33:57] rights all over america
[1:34:03] if you read her qualifications she's way
[1:34:06] overqualified
[1:34:09] but if you notice what she was she's a
[1:34:11] catholic
[1:34:16] and if you remember kavanaugh
[1:34:21] they gave him an all kind of problems
[1:34:26] but now it's all catholic and a jew
[1:34:27] there
[1:34:29] on our supreme court brother branham
[1:34:32] said that
[1:34:33] in 1954
[1:34:37] and it's been fulfilled in the last
[1:34:39] couple of weeks
[1:34:41] someone told me the other day said what
[1:34:43] about that beautiful woman that brother
[1:34:44] branham talks about in with the white
[1:34:46] house
[1:34:48] when is that going to be fulfilled have
[1:34:50] you been asleep
[1:34:54] have you been asleep miss universe has
[1:34:58] been miss trump
[1:35:01] the last four years
[1:35:06] well brother gone they're going to have
[1:35:07] cars that can drive them down the road
[1:35:10] have you been asleep
[1:35:16] you thought i was talking politics i was
[1:35:18] actually talking visions
[1:35:25] [Music]
[1:35:26] oh one day one day one day one day it's
[1:35:29] going to happen and it's already
[1:35:31] happened
[1:35:33] and a prophet standing there
[1:35:39] said this is going to happen and that's
[1:35:40] going to happen and that's going to
[1:35:42] happen
[1:35:42] and listen let me just say it wasn't
[1:35:44] what william branham's opinions was
[1:35:47] it was god's thoughts because this isn't
[1:35:49] the message of wicked brahim
[1:35:51] this is the message of the lamb
[1:36:01] and it only came to put magnification on
[1:36:04] this book
[1:36:06] to open it up to where you could
[1:36:08] understand it
[1:36:10] this wasn't feeding on the mind of a man
[1:36:13] it's feeding on the body word of the son
[1:36:16] of
[1:36:16] man and your your identification
[1:36:21] as the predestinated seed of god is when
[1:36:24] you hear it
[1:36:25] you're like hattie right you say that's
[1:36:27] absolutely the truth
[1:36:30] all glory
[1:36:34] that's absolutely the truth
[1:36:38] i may not understand it but i believe it
[1:36:42] with all my heart
[1:36:56] [Applause]
[1:37:04] oh
[1:37:06] three years a vision i held close to my
[1:37:09] heart
[1:37:10] whitney's gonna have a baby
[1:37:14] three years i carried it with his name
[1:37:18] and i refused to say it i refused to
[1:37:22] utter
[1:37:22] that name across my lips and i
[1:37:26] held it because it was like
[1:37:29] it was like i was holding a mandate of
[1:37:31] god
[1:37:32] it wasn't hold real tight to this now
[1:37:35] catch this real quick
[1:37:37] are you with me you know who i'm talking
[1:37:39] to
[1:37:41] it wasn't a question of if it's going to
[1:37:46] happen
[1:37:48] so it doesn't matter what the devil
[1:37:50] whispers in your ears
[1:37:52] it doesn't matter what he says and it
[1:37:54] doesn't matter the critic
[1:38:03] and it was an impossibility for her womb
[1:38:06] and then after his hips were destroyed
[1:38:08] and his human anatomy was destroyed it
[1:38:11] looked like it was totally impossible
[1:38:14] can you imagine how many times satan
[1:38:16] whispered in my ear
[1:38:24] if you'll trust me i'll use you like
[1:38:25] never before
[1:38:31] and he when he was born when he was born
[1:38:36] listen when they came through the prayer
[1:38:38] line that night in august
[1:38:39] and i said the angel of god is visiting
[1:38:41] your house and it's time for the vision
[1:38:44] to be fulfilled and sister autumn and
[1:38:46] brother jonathan was next in line
[1:38:48] and i looked at him and i said any same
[1:38:50] angel is visiting your house
[1:38:54] and they both go to the same doctor not
[1:38:56] knowing in total secrecy
[1:38:58] and show up at the same time
[1:39:01] god's really neat how he works now mr
[1:39:05] critic let me just say this to you
[1:39:07] you couldn't stop it
[1:39:23] you see it's the devil that gets in the
[1:39:25] details
[1:39:26] it's the devil that tries to stop you in
[1:39:29] every way oh i feel like preaching he
[1:39:32] tries to stop you
[1:39:34] because he knows what you're identified
[1:39:36] for
[1:39:37] [Applause]
[1:39:39] you're not tree germ seed you're not
[1:39:42] camel germ seed
[1:39:44] you're not denominational germ seed
[1:39:46] [Applause]
[1:39:48] you're the germ seed brod the
[1:39:51] predestinated broad
[1:39:53] of jesus christ and there's
[1:39:56] nothing there's nothing
[1:40:01] that the devil can do to stop it satan's
[1:40:08] tried
[1:40:08] everything that he can to do to stop
[1:40:12] the word of god
[1:40:27] bring me a paper towel
[1:40:37] i preached at brother joe green's camp
[1:40:39] meeting
[1:40:41] last year it was last year wasn't it
[1:40:56] i appreciate his camp meeting last year
[1:40:59] in north carolina
[1:41:04] while i preached two preachers in
[1:41:07] particular tried to stop me
[1:41:10] while i was preaching
[1:41:14] say 800 people there maybe
[1:41:17] and two men try to stop me preaching
[1:41:24] and they literally put their heels in
[1:41:26] the ground and they tried to stop me
[1:41:29] listen a demon sphere to try to stop you
[1:41:31] while you're preaching
[1:41:34] and because i could see where it was
[1:41:36] coming from
[1:41:37] i wanted to be i wanted to i wanted to
[1:41:41] be delicate with it but i wanted to get
[1:41:44] them to know i know where it's coming
[1:41:45] from
[1:41:48] and i stopped and i said now you stop
[1:41:51] holding back on me now
[1:41:54] because they were turning away from the
[1:41:55] message and they had been messaged
[1:41:58] preachers for a long time
[1:42:00] and they're turning away from the
[1:42:03] message of the hour
[1:42:04] and they come to that meeting to cause
[1:42:06] problems
[1:42:08] it won't stop god
[1:42:14] and i i stopped two or three times and i
[1:42:16] said let up
[1:42:18] let up you know who i know now who you
[1:42:20] are
[1:42:21] and finally i stopped and i said
[1:42:25] i'll call your name.
[1:42:32] if you don't stop
[1:42:36] you see i'm not scared
[1:42:40] because i know where i'm at
[1:42:44] i'm not scared once he tells me i'm not
[1:42:47] scared
[1:42:50] are you with me that's the reason when
[1:42:52] you sit in this building right here
[1:42:55] it's a good place to repent
[1:42:58] because it's me it's not me that can see
[1:43:01] your sin
[1:43:02] there's another one preaching and if
[1:43:05] you're the seed of god
[1:43:07] he'll call you out in your bathtub
[1:43:29] they eased up they quit
[1:43:33] they stopped they backed off i finished
[1:43:37] preaching
[1:43:40] it was just a just a shake in the
[1:43:42] building
[1:43:43] that reverence of god and i could feel
[1:43:47] the angel on the platform
[1:43:52] last night we were visited by an angel
[1:43:55] it was in the back room
[1:44:00] is this okay
[1:44:07] and i was telling sister sarah
[1:44:10] and brother gabriel because we got here
[1:44:13] early because of the funeral
[1:44:15] and i just we had been just small
[1:44:18] talking
[1:44:20] i'm getting off channel here for a
[1:44:21] moment but this is this is a good spot
[1:44:23] for you to relax
[1:44:28] and so i was just talking to them and i
[1:44:31] was just
[1:44:32] and all of a sudden i felt the channel
[1:44:34] to move
[1:44:36] about brother biscuit being in the car
[1:44:40] and i said you know i always pondered
[1:44:43] brother nathanael i always pondered
[1:44:46] about when
[1:44:47] brother biscuit tells his story
[1:44:50] and i've heard it i've heard i've heard
[1:44:52] it from brother biskell
[1:44:54] i've been with brother biskell and
[1:44:55] preached conventions all over the world
[1:44:58] and and i heard it over and over again
[1:45:01] about
[1:45:02] and there was something that was always
[1:45:03] in my mind
[1:45:05] about when the angel drops in the car
[1:45:08] he's forward
[1:45:09] looking back into the car blaine is in
[1:45:12] the back seat
[1:45:13] brother branham his face turns ashen his
[1:45:16] beard is standing out
[1:45:18] and he's tilted his head back and
[1:45:21] brother biscuit said my head was thrust
[1:45:24] brother kenny he said my head was thrust
[1:45:26] against the window
[1:45:28] and he said i looked out of the corner
[1:45:29] of my eye and he said brother branham
[1:45:31] looked like a dead man
[1:45:33] and he said it was a being that was in
[1:45:35] the car but if you remember what he
[1:45:37] talks about and he's told it for
[1:45:39] decades they were talking about
[1:45:42] brother branham talks about could this
[1:45:46] be the ministry of elijah and he said
[1:45:49] in that moment the
[1:45:52] angel drops in the car
[1:45:55] you don't need 10 000 people there
[1:45:59] you don't need ten thousand people well
[1:46:01] brother ron we believe brother briskell
[1:46:03] and brother biscuits made mistakes in
[1:46:05] his life so have you
[1:46:09] so have you well how can we believe that
[1:46:13] the witness of one man we believe the
[1:46:16] witness of mary
[1:46:18] a teenage girl that met an angel of the
[1:46:22] lord
[1:46:23] and he called her by name because she
[1:46:26] was identified
[1:46:28] she was identified to be the mother
[1:46:32] of jesus christ the very incubator
[1:46:36] to carry the word of god
[1:46:40] [Applause]
[1:46:44] we believed her
[1:46:51] and i was sharing that testimony
[1:46:56] with them and as i came to
[1:47:00] that angel dropping in the car he came
[1:47:03] in the back room
[1:47:06] brother gabriel's testimony because he
[1:47:08] stays with me a bit
[1:47:12] he move in with me if he wants me to i
[1:47:14] like having a state trooper living with
[1:47:16] me
[1:47:21] there's a young man that's been raised
[1:47:22] in the message
[1:47:25] but he had a desire to meet the god of
[1:47:28] this message
[1:47:29] it's not enough to know the message it's
[1:47:32] not enough to know the books and the
[1:47:33] quotes and the tapes and all of the
[1:47:35] things
[1:47:36] you want to know jesus and he told me
[1:47:38] this morning he said
[1:47:39] i want to be in that supernatural
[1:47:41] presence
[1:47:43] he said i want to be in that it's
[1:47:45] because he's identified
[1:47:50] identified for that there's a purpose
[1:47:55] we're identified for this
[1:47:59] hallelujah my boys want to come to this
[1:48:02] place
[1:48:04] they're identified for this
[1:48:09] it doesn't matter what you live in no
[1:48:11] matter what you go
[1:48:13] no matter what you drive this is only
[1:48:14] temporal
[1:48:16] you're identified for rapture
[1:48:28] hallelujah in north carolina
[1:48:33] i was coming toward the end of the
[1:48:34] service
[1:48:36] and i knew the angel was on the platform
[1:48:39] i say that with incredible reverence and
[1:48:42] i hope you understand that
[1:48:44] i don't pretend to be a prophet
[1:48:48] but i am a message preacher
[1:48:51] and this message is accompanied by the
[1:48:54] angel
[1:48:55] of the lord
[1:48:59] i don't have to back the message up he
[1:49:02] is here to do that
[1:49:15] i don't have no special revelation on it
[1:49:19] i don't have some way out supernatural
[1:49:21] gift
[1:49:22] all i know is if i put my finger in a
[1:49:24] bucket of water and pull it out
[1:49:26] that's how important i am find the whole
[1:49:28] that's how important i
[1:49:29] am but i do know this
[1:49:34] god's got a purpose in my life
[1:49:38] and satan has done everything that he
[1:49:40] can do to destroy
[1:49:42] this body but he can't stop this
[1:49:47] he has proved he don't have enough
[1:49:51] to stop this ministry
[1:50:03] [Applause]
[1:50:09] let me just say this to you church he
[1:50:12] has proven
[1:50:13] and vindicated to us i don't have enough
[1:50:16] to stop the god
[1:50:18] in ron spencer
[1:50:25] satan that's made his challenge he's
[1:50:27] proved it
[1:50:30] he's actually vindicated us
[1:50:34] that he don't have enough he would have
[1:50:37] if he could
[1:50:38] have
[1:50:39] [Applause]
[1:50:41] lightning strikes strokes hurt
[1:50:46] full forty feet afar
[1:50:50] stage four brain and lung condition
[1:50:57] brother ron are you daring the devil no
[1:50:59] i'm just telling him
[1:51:00] i'm looking at him squaring the eyes i'm
[1:51:03] not muhammad ali
[1:51:06] but is that the best that you got
[1:51:09] because i got a god behind me
[1:51:34] i'll only be a few more minutes now
[1:51:37] and i'll pick this up next sunday
[1:51:42] and i said if god can't operate out here
[1:51:44] he'll operate behind a carton
[1:51:47] and that's exactly how i pointed behind
[1:51:50] the curtain
[1:51:51] and in that building many of you have
[1:51:53] never been in that building
[1:51:55] that building is a monster auditorium it
[1:51:57] holds
[1:51:59] i don't know how many people but it but
[1:52:01] it holds quite a few people
[1:52:03] and it has huge because it's theatrical
[1:52:07] orchestra
[1:52:08] all different kind of things has huge
[1:52:10] curtains
[1:52:11] and they're black curtains i could go
[1:52:13] into the details of why they use black
[1:52:15] because
[1:52:16] it's there's a reason for it but anyway
[1:52:19] they use
[1:52:19] black curtains it's because it shines it
[1:52:21] shows everything in front of it
[1:52:23] that's what it does it shows everything
[1:52:25] in front if you
[1:52:26] if you put white or red or blue it'll
[1:52:29] absorb what's in front of but when you
[1:52:30] use black
[1:52:31] it stands out it's kind of like a
[1:52:33] diamond
[1:52:35] hey it's coming up here like a like a
[1:52:36] fire hose it's kind of like a diamond
[1:52:41] you don't put a diamond on a piece of
[1:52:43] white cloth
[1:52:45] to try to show it off you take a diamond
[1:52:51] and if it's two carrots you put it on
[1:52:54] black curtain
[1:52:55] cloth because just throw a little light
[1:52:58] on it with that black curtain cloth
[1:53:01] and every every diamond that's inside of
[1:53:04] that piece of rock
[1:53:06] will scream out
[1:53:09] that's why you take god's diamonds and
[1:53:12] put it in laodicea
[1:53:14] and you could put it in the worst day in
[1:53:17] the worst hour
[1:53:18] under the worst conditions and you put a
[1:53:21] little light on it
[1:53:23] and every attribute of that diamond will
[1:53:27] shine
[1:53:30] [Applause]
[1:53:35] oh glory to god
[1:53:39] let it shine let it shine
[1:53:57] so i'm stepping off of the stage and i'm
[1:54:00] done
[1:54:05] i take my bible i take my coat matthew
[1:54:08] is my
[1:54:09] guy that takes care of me always even
[1:54:12] here have someone that's
[1:54:13] designated to take care of me
[1:54:17] because it's like you're standing in two
[1:54:18] worlds at the same time
[1:54:20] like what i'm doing this morning some of
[1:54:23] you're not aware of this some of you
[1:54:25] eaten or whatever but i'm standing in
[1:54:27] two worlds
[1:54:31] i'm operating in two dimensions i step
[1:54:34] through
[1:54:35] behind those curtains and i start to
[1:54:37] step to the office and all of a sudden
[1:54:39] the spirit of god
[1:54:40] whirls me around and caitlyn that is
[1:54:42] standing right back there
[1:54:44] so many people that are that are on the
[1:54:47] internet

[1:55:06] so wave adam
[1:55:12] she was praying for a baby isn't that
[1:55:16] right
[1:55:23] and she's praying for baby and in that
[1:55:26] presence
[1:55:29] god spoke to her some words that were
[1:55:31] very private
[1:55:33] and then turned to nathan nathanael and
[1:55:35] brought them two together
[1:55:40] to the very weak
[1:55:47] the very day a year later
[1:55:50] the very day a year later
[1:55:54] charlie
[1:55:59] was born
[1:56:07] not ron spencer god
[1:56:18] sister jackson came and she got a real
[1:56:22] touch from god
[1:56:23] her husband walked up said you've been
[1:56:27] neglecting the gift
[1:56:28] 17 years you need to be more sincere and
[1:56:33] give yourself to it
[1:56:35] and now he's preached in many churches
[1:56:38] many meetings since that time
[1:56:42] 17 years he'd fought it but god knew it
[1:56:48] another and another and guido
[1:56:52] interesting interesting that this would
[1:56:54] be the time
[1:56:56] to one year ago today

[1:57:05] a real friend of mine and i'm not going
[1:57:07] to go into the
[1:57:09] privacy issue he was a real friend of
[1:57:11] mine

[1:57:18] devil anyway

[1:57:25] many knows what big meadows is that
[1:57:27] for years he had asked me years he'd
[1:57:30] asked me said brother ron i have a
[1:57:32] question for you
[1:57:33] and it seemed like whenever he had asked
[1:57:35] me that something would come up and we
[1:57:36] wouldn't get to the question
[1:57:40] you'll like this and he comes here
[1:57:45] and homer would call him jido
[1:57:49] never could say guido but he'd call him

[2:04:29] baptized
[2:04:31] maybe he couldn't put it all together
[2:04:33] but he knew god helped him deconstruct
[2:04:35] this art
[2:04:36] and now he's gathered the animals in and
[2:04:39] listen this may be my last sermon
[2:04:41] but i'm going to preach it to you god's
[2:04:43] going to destroy the earth with

[2:04:55] door
[2:04:57] and noah couldn't get back out and

[2:07:19] were more than just to fulfill
[2:07:22] satan in a church
[2:07:26] we were more than just to sit in a
[2:07:28] certain pew
[2:07:29] or have a certain family we were
[2:07:32] put here we stepped out of eternity to
[2:07:36] the dna of humanity
