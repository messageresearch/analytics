[54:28] and then down to first peter chapter 1
[54:32] and verse 3
[54:36] john the book of john chapter 14 and
[54:39] verse 16.

[54:45] while we were actually reading the
[54:47] scripture the lord dropped this sermon

[54:54] on this thought and has dealt with me
[54:56] every morning before i
[54:57] i have awoken on this thought and i'd
[55:00] like to speak to you
[55:01] on after the trial after the hurt

[55:10] pray the father
[55:12] and he shall give you another comforter
[55:13] that he may abide with you forever
[55:16] even the spirit of truth whom the world

[55:52] my father and ye and me and i
[55:55] in you first peter chapter 1 and verse
[55:58] 3.
[55:59] so look at that that john chapter 14 we
[56:02] see
[56:02] that the disciples were in a moment of
[56:05] crisis they were in a moment
[56:07] of perplexity because
[56:10] they're seeing him but they're
[56:14] getting ready to not see him and here he
[56:17] is saying to them
[56:19] you see me but you won't see me but i
[56:21] will not leave you comfortless if i
[56:23] don't go away
[56:24] i can't come to you again but he says i
[56:27] will come to you
[56:28] and what an assurance that is in our
[56:31] heart to know that
[56:32] he will come to you in the trial he'll
[56:35] come to you
[56:35] in your pain he will come to you in the
[56:38] hurt he will come to you
[56:40] first peter chapter 1 and verse 3
[56:42] blessed be the god and
[56:44] father of our lord jesus christ which
[56:45] according to his abundant mercy
[56:48] hath begotten us again unto a lively
[56:50] hope by the resurrection of jesus christ
[56:52] from the dead
[56:53] to an inheritance incorruptible and
[56:56] undefiled
[56:57] that fadeth not away reserved in heaven
[57:01] for you
[57:02] who are kept by the power of god through
[57:04] faith unto salvation ready to be
[57:06] revealed in this last time
[57:08] wherein you greatly rejoice though now
[57:11] for
[57:12] a season if need be you're in heaviness
[57:15] through manifold temptations that the
[57:18] trial of your faith being much more
[57:21] precious than that of gold
[57:23] that perisheth though it betrayed with
[57:25] fire might be found
[57:27] unto praise honor and glory at the
[57:30] appearing of jesus christ
[57:32] whom having not seen ye love
[57:36] in whom though now ye see him not yet
[57:39] believing ye rejoice with joy
[57:41] unspeakable
[57:42] and full of glory when you're going
[57:46] through a test
[57:47] your faith is on trial how many has a
[57:50] need that you like to take before the
[57:52] lord this evening heavenly father we
[57:54] come before you tonight and most humbly

[58:08] living oracles unto the the the god of
[58:11] heaven
[58:12] and father you have implanted and

[58:16] seal of the holy spirit upon our lives

[59:02] abundantly

[59:09] that they could feel the presence of
[59:11] elohim himself in the room with them
[59:14] may you speak lip to ear to us hear our
[59:17] speaker and all
[59:18] in the name of jesus christ amen god
[59:21] bless you you can be seated tonight
[59:22] in the presence of the lord we we we
[59:25] won't hold you long tonight but we just
[59:27] want
[59:28] to say so say a few things that's on our
[59:30] heart that god's dealt with us
[59:32] on but we we know
[59:35] as as human beings we we are apt to go
[59:38] through things and we're apt to have
[59:40] troubles we're apt to have
[59:41] trials and and you can you can relax
[59:44] just for a moment
[59:45] i'm going to take you on the other side
[59:46] of that trial
[59:48] and you don't have to get get all scared
[59:50] and think i'm going to call your name
[59:52] and say you're getting ready to go
[59:53] through a trial but
[59:54] i want to preach to you on after the
[59:56] trial
[59:57] and but as human beings we we go through
[59:59] things and so many times we
[1:00:01] we we go through things and wonder why
[1:00:03] we go through things and
[1:00:05] we know that that how god developed
[1:00:08] humanity and as he stood there in
[1:00:10] creation as we begin to read over in the
[1:00:12] book of genesis chapter 1 and we begin
[1:00:14] to look over
[1:00:15] the things of god we begin to watch as
[1:00:17] he begins to
[1:00:18] as he begins to evolve humanity and
[1:00:21] begin to work through humanity
[1:00:23] that god he began to reflect himself
[1:00:25] that in god were all of these attributes
[1:00:28] and it attributes to be a creator
[1:00:31] attributes to be a speaker
[1:00:32] attributes to be to be a healer
[1:00:34] attributes to be a god
[1:00:37] and that we realize that when god began
[1:00:39] to create
[1:00:40] he created and he began to reflect
[1:00:42] himself in
[1:00:44] in botany life in the tree life and then
[1:00:46] even in the animal life we can look at
[1:00:48] the animal life and we can see god in
[1:00:50] those things we can look at botany life
[1:00:52] and we can see god in those things
[1:00:54] and then we we look as as god when he
[1:00:56] came to his highest creation
[1:00:58] he came and he he developed a human
[1:01:01] being
[1:01:02] and he first made that man in the image
[1:01:04] of christ and then
[1:01:06] in the image of himself and then he made
[1:01:08] man out of the dust of the earth
[1:01:10] and he brought him from the 16 elements
[1:01:12] just like you were brought out of this
[1:01:14] world and have made of the same 16
[1:01:16] elements of potash and calcium
[1:01:19] and all of those details of your life
[1:01:21] and and there's certain
[1:01:22] a certain amount of each and every one
[1:01:24] of you that that the ground that you're
[1:01:26] born in those things that you carry with
[1:01:28] you and there's
[1:01:29] there's certain dna markers even in your
[1:01:31] even in your lineage
[1:01:33] and that that link you to the things in
[1:01:35] your past that
[1:01:37] that you can look back to and you can
[1:01:39] see that this is where my family came
[1:01:41] from that
[1:01:41] this is what this one per this person
[1:01:43] said that
[1:01:44] that even that even now science is so
[1:01:47] developed that they can even tell you
[1:01:49] what kind of sickness
[1:01:50] that you're going to deal with even in
[1:01:52] your future because of dna markers that
[1:01:55] are there that are laying in your
[1:01:57] genealogy
[1:01:58] they can look at those things but when
[1:02:00] god is building man and developing man
[1:02:02] and creating man
[1:02:04] and we look at those things that that
[1:02:05] god was reflecting himself and it
[1:02:08] couldn't get no higher than the creation
[1:02:10] of man
[1:02:11] but when god created man we are taught
[1:02:13] by the prophet that
[1:02:15] that he created in man he put in him
[1:02:17] five a five inmates to the flesh that we
[1:02:20] could touch this natural world that we
[1:02:22] see
[1:02:22] the seed taste feel smell and hear and
[1:02:25] that's how we touch the outside world
[1:02:27] and
[1:02:28] and we we're so amazed when you watch a
[1:02:30] when you watch a child as they're so
[1:02:32] amazed when they they begin to touch
[1:02:34] things and taste
[1:02:35] things and see things and hear things
[1:02:37] for the very first times that
[1:02:39] their reactions that they make and then
[1:02:41] on the inside of that inner man
[1:02:43] there is that spirit realm of of
[1:02:45] conscience and reasoning and
[1:02:47] imaginations and
[1:02:48] and love and all of those things that
[1:02:50] are built up but on the inside of that
[1:02:53] is the real you that soul that's where
[1:02:55] you live that
[1:02:56] and that's where god wants to dwell at
[1:02:58] but we look at humanity
[1:03:00] and we see that humanity is so affected
[1:03:04] is so affected by the the five inlets of
[1:03:07] the flesh
[1:03:08] and so affected by the five inlets of of
[1:03:11] the spirit
[1:03:12] and as human beings we begin to build up
[1:03:14] emotions we begin to build up certain
[1:03:16] things in our spirit
[1:03:18] you watch people as they go on in time
[1:03:20] they'll they'll hear something or
[1:03:22] they'll do something they'll build up a
[1:03:24] complex about a certain thing or they'll
[1:03:26] build up
[1:03:26] reasonings in their spirit and it's an
[1:03:28] amazing thing to if you
[1:03:30] if you just watch human life and you
[1:03:32] begin to watch one another and you
[1:03:34] become friends with one another and you
[1:03:35] watch as people go through certain
[1:03:37] things
[1:03:38] and it's it's it's it's amazing thing
[1:03:40] the the things that humanity can go
[1:03:43] through and people that you know
[1:03:45] that may be sitting on the pulpit
[1:03:46] tonight go through everything imaginable
[1:03:48] and people that you know personally they
[1:03:51] live with scars they live with hurts
[1:03:53] they live with pain they
[1:03:54] they live with pains of the past they
[1:03:56] live with they live with
[1:03:58] such deep scars that are there that that
[1:04:00] that
[1:04:01] that that has been left there because of
[1:04:03] somebody
[1:04:04] did something to them and and it's
[1:04:06] created a stigma or created a complex on
[1:04:09] the inside of them
[1:04:11] that they carry with them and it's an
[1:04:13] amazing thing what a person can actually
[1:04:15] go through in life
[1:04:16] and even live through but we know that
[1:04:19] that that's
[1:04:20] life is not offered us a flower bit of
[1:04:22] ease
[1:04:23] but we know that he has told us that no
[1:04:25] matter what we go through
[1:04:27] no matter the trials we face no matter
[1:04:29] the the pain that we go through that his
[1:04:31] grace would be sufficient for
[1:04:33] us in that hour of need that that when
[1:04:36] we're weak
[1:04:37] then he is be made strong and we as
[1:04:40] humanity we go
[1:04:41] we fight sickness we fight afflictions
[1:04:44] we we fight diseases we fight turmoil
[1:04:47] but he said that many are the
[1:04:49] afflictions of the righteous
[1:04:51] but it's after those afflictions that
[1:04:54] the lord delivers out of all of them
[1:04:57] and it's amazing thing to watch when
[1:04:59] somebody goes through so many things
[1:05:01] and there's some things that are even
[1:05:03] worse than death that people have to
[1:05:05] live in a vegetable state for so many
[1:05:07] times and you
[1:05:08] maybe you've had to deal with that as in
[1:05:10] a family member that they've
[1:05:11] had to go through that state and
[1:05:14] paralysis and
[1:05:15] being a vegetable in their mind being a
[1:05:17] vegetable in their body
[1:05:18] and it leaves a deep scar on your
[1:05:21] humanity
[1:05:22] that you actually carry with you and you
[1:05:24] perceive
[1:05:25] things in ways and you look at things
[1:05:27] because of the scar
[1:05:29] or the hurt and the trial that somebody
[1:05:32] went through and you were a part of
[1:05:34] there are certain things that you go
[1:05:35] through as a as a church member that i
[1:05:38] carry with myself because you went
[1:05:40] through it or your pastor brother on he
[1:05:42] carries those things
[1:05:43] because what it did what a person does
[1:05:46] when they when a man of god if he before
[1:05:48] he can do anything for you
[1:05:50] he's got to intercede he's got to get
[1:05:52] into a place
[1:05:53] where he can feel for you he's got to
[1:05:56] put himself in a place that he can
[1:05:58] he can pray like it's like it's you like
[1:06:01] he's going through that
[1:06:03] when brother branham said now he said i
[1:06:04] can't do anything for that person
[1:06:06] unless i feel something for that person
[1:06:10] now notice in the sermon i know he said
[1:06:12] why does god let troubles come
[1:06:14] god harnesses trouble and puts bits in
[1:06:16] his mouth and makes oh
[1:06:17] makes it obey him and those troubles
[1:06:19] bring us into a closer fellowship with
[1:06:21] god
[1:06:22] there's been no rainbow until the flood
[1:06:24] came but
[1:06:25] after noah pressed in i want you to key
[1:06:28] on those words after tonight
[1:06:30] but after noah pressed into that
[1:06:32] condition that he was in to float 40
[1:06:34] days and nights in the storm and the
[1:06:36] little ark pitching up and down
[1:06:38] and in the water it was after the flood
[1:06:41] was over
[1:06:42] that they saw the rainbow for its first
[1:06:44] time the covenant of hope the covenant
[1:06:46] of promise
[1:06:47] after he went through the tribulation
[1:06:50] then he saw the promise
[1:06:51] he said that's the way you see the
[1:06:53] promise after you've gone through
[1:06:55] tribulation
[1:06:56] you see maybe that's what he's doing to
[1:06:58] you tonight may he might have gave you
[1:07:00] cancer he might have given you this he
[1:07:01] might
[1:07:02] give you that he might give you a broke
[1:07:03] up home he may give you a tour apart he
[1:07:05] may
[1:07:06] give you worries he might give you
[1:07:07] headaches i don't know what he will do
[1:07:09] but there's one thing i do know that he
[1:07:12] still
[1:07:12] got his eye on you that no matter what
[1:07:15] you go through
[1:07:16] that he's still got his eye on you so i
[1:07:20] know if he's watching over the sparrow i
[1:07:22] know that he's watching over
[1:07:24] over me but you see it so many times of
[1:07:27] people that go through things and go
[1:07:28] through hurts
[1:07:29] that they that they carry those things
[1:07:31] and they're not able to move on from
[1:07:33] that hurt
[1:07:34] and you find a person and you find a
[1:07:37] person that's holding on to things and
[1:07:38] people that hold on to
[1:07:40] hurt and hold on to pain they often
[1:07:42] relive that pain
[1:07:43] every day over and over again in their
[1:07:46] mind they're constantly batting these
[1:07:48] things
[1:07:48] and sometimes a person gets stuck in
[1:07:51] that
[1:07:52] in that thought or in that pain or in
[1:07:54] that hurt
[1:07:55] and in that blame and they blame this
[1:07:57] one for that one or they blame that one
[1:07:59] for this one
[1:08:00] and they blame they blame their daddy
[1:08:02] for for
[1:08:03] just taking a drink and now that way my
[1:08:05] daddy got it and now i got to do that or
[1:08:07] i blame i blame my granddaddy he had
[1:08:10] cancer and now it's passed down through
[1:08:12] our genealogies and
[1:08:13] and they're constantly carrying a pain
[1:08:16] and they can't move on from that pain
[1:08:18] and
[1:08:18] it's constantly in their conversation
[1:08:21] and it's constantly in their mind and
[1:08:23] they're holding on to those things
[1:08:24] and they just can't let it go and what
[1:08:27] they do is they become a victim of
[1:08:29] circumstance that they that they enjoy
[1:08:33] actually being the victim of
[1:08:34] circumstance because when you go
[1:08:36] through circumstances you watch people
[1:08:39] that they're always going through
[1:08:40] something that they enjoy
[1:08:42] being that victim because what it what a
[1:08:44] victim does
[1:08:45] it allows them to be be in a
[1:08:49] basically on the winning side it's you
[1:08:52] against the rest of the world and they
[1:08:54] enjoy the emotions because they said
[1:08:57] well
[1:08:57] the reason why i'm going through this is
[1:08:59] because i went through that or the
[1:09:01] reason why i'm this way is because of
[1:09:02] that happened in my life
[1:09:04] and they enjoy being a part of being the
[1:09:06] victim of their circumstance or being a
[1:09:08] victim of the things of their past
[1:09:10] and it allows them to it allows them
[1:09:13] basically a great excuse for
[1:09:15] this is the way that i am that i am but
[1:09:17] i don't want
[1:09:18] i don't want you to get this in your
[1:09:20] mind tonight that i'm telling you these
[1:09:21] things
[1:09:22] that that you stay in that condition but
[1:09:24] but christianity does not allow you to
[1:09:26] conform to the world or conform to your
[1:09:28] excuses
[1:09:29] but christianity the power of christ
[1:09:32] wants to get rid of your excuses it
[1:09:34] wants to get rid of that attitude of
[1:09:35] being a victim
[1:09:36] he wants to get rid of that pain it
[1:09:38] wants to get rid of that hurt
[1:09:39] he wants to get rid of those things that
[1:09:41] you carry in your dna
[1:09:43] but you watch a person that's dealing
[1:09:44] with that with a mentality that i'm the
[1:09:46] victim they actually
[1:09:48] feel they they enjoy being that because
[1:09:50] it's them against the world
[1:09:52] but i don't want i don't want to say
[1:09:54] this to you and make you feel like i
[1:09:56] don't care
[1:09:57] but the rest of the world really don't
[1:09:58] care what you're going through
[1:10:00] the rest of the world really don't care
[1:10:02] what what your feelings are or
[1:10:04] i was hurt by this or by the hurt i want
[1:10:07] you to know the world's still revolving
[1:10:09] even though you're going through pain
[1:10:10] and i'm not trying to say i don't care
[1:10:12] about your pain and i'm not trying to
[1:10:13] say that i don't care about your
[1:10:15] feelings
[1:10:15] but your feet yes your feelings matter
[1:10:18] yes you're special to god
[1:10:20] yes you mean something to god but you
[1:10:22] can never allow
[1:10:23] your feelings to override your faith
[1:10:27] you can never allow your feelings to
[1:10:29] override
[1:10:30] everything else around you and you can
[1:10:32] never allow
[1:10:33] your feelings to get so bottled up that
[1:10:36] everybody else's feelings don't matter
[1:10:38] and you're the only one that actually
[1:10:40] has a case
[1:10:41] and you're the only one that your
[1:10:42] feelings are the only things that matter
[1:10:44] you see that's what a victim of
[1:10:47] circumstance will go
[1:10:48] through that that their faith is built
[1:10:51] there or their feelings are built upon
[1:10:53] circumstances
[1:10:54] could you imagine if mary strictly based
[1:10:57] her faith upon or was strictly living
[1:11:00] off of her feelings
[1:11:02] we would not have had a mary that
[1:11:04] brought forth jesus we might have had
[1:11:06] somebody else now jesus would have came
[1:11:07] through somebody else but before the
[1:11:09] foundation of the world god had seen
[1:11:12] mary that she was willing to go through
[1:11:14] the pain
[1:11:15] that this was an earthen vessel that he
[1:11:17] had predestinated before the foundation
[1:11:19] of the world
[1:11:20] that that bidding ground could handle
[1:11:22] the seed
[1:11:23] that would come through that wound are
[1:11:26] you with me tonight he has looked on you
[1:11:28] and he's seen you not because of your
[1:11:30] choice but strictly because of his
[1:11:32] election
[1:11:33] and predestination he chose you he
[1:11:36] looked at you
[1:11:37] and seen that you could handle the seed
[1:11:39] you could go through the pain
[1:11:40] you could go through the herd you could
[1:11:42] go through the child
[1:11:43] for the trial and you still come out on
[1:11:45] the other side
[1:11:47] still believing the promise and you
[1:11:48] wouldn't be affected
[1:11:50] by everything else around you mary was
[1:11:52] not affected because anybody else
[1:11:54] doubted her
[1:11:55] circumstance or vowing to value devalued
[1:11:58] her testimony
[1:11:59] she was not bothered by how she felt
[1:12:01] before she felt anything in her belly
[1:12:04] she began to testify she didn't testify
[1:12:06] from her feelings
[1:12:07] she was testify because an angel of god
[1:12:10] had stood there and said
[1:12:12] you shall bring for the child and she
[1:12:14] pondered these things in her heart
[1:12:17] she said be it unto me according to thy
[1:12:20] word
[1:12:21] and there has been an angel that has
[1:12:22] stood in this hour that has seen you
[1:12:24] that you were predestined
[1:12:26] to carry that seed of the gene word of
[1:12:29] god
[1:12:29] that everything else around you would
[1:12:31] not affect you laodicea wouldn't affect
[1:12:34] you
[1:12:34] trials wouldn't affect you sickness
[1:12:36] wouldn't affect you
[1:12:37] but you wouldn't go off your feelings
[1:12:39] but you would strictly go
[1:12:41] off the promises of god
[1:12:44] are you with me as a christian you
[1:12:47] better get used to hurt
[1:12:49] as a christian you better get used to
[1:12:51] trials because the devil's going to hurt
[1:12:53] you
[1:12:54] the devil's going to try to steal he's
[1:12:56] going to try to kill you he's going to
[1:12:57] try to rob you
[1:12:58] he's going to try to hurt your feelings
[1:13:00] he's going to try to work up your
[1:13:02] emotions
[1:13:02] he's going to try to kill your family
[1:13:04] he's going to try to steal your wealth
[1:13:06] he's going to try to take your health
[1:13:08] but i want you to know there's one thing
[1:13:10] that the devil can't hurt
[1:13:11] and that's that soul that's that faith
[1:13:14] are you with me he can't hurt that
[1:13:16] he can hurt your emotions he can hurt
[1:13:18] your daddy he can hurt your mama
[1:13:20] he can take your mama from his world but
[1:13:22] he cannot touch that gene seed of god
[1:13:27] are you with me
[1:13:29] [Applause]
[1:13:31] is or it's an awesome thing when a
[1:13:33] person
[1:13:34] when a person goes through something and
[1:13:36] they don't become defined by that
[1:13:38] something
[1:13:40] i have refused in my life that i will be
[1:13:43] defined
[1:13:44] by the circumstances that i am under and
[1:13:47] i will i have refused in my life to be
[1:13:50] to be defined by the circumstances of
[1:13:52] life of somebody
[1:13:53] else if i'm not going to do it for
[1:13:55] myself i'm definitely not going to put
[1:13:56] myself in a place of somebody else and
[1:13:58] go through that
[1:13:58] and let that person's life and that
[1:14:00] personal circumstance define me
[1:14:03] as a human being you see the things of
[1:14:05] your life if they define
[1:14:07] who you are you are going to be a
[1:14:09] miserable creature
[1:14:11] although throughout your life you have
[1:14:13] an old crabbit spirit
[1:14:14] and you'll walk around and say wowzy
[1:14:16] wowzy woo it happened to me
[1:14:18] it should have happened to you
[1:14:21] but rahab was not defined by her past
[1:14:25] she was defined by her faith she was not
[1:14:28] defined
[1:14:29] by her job description she was defined
[1:14:32] by the lineage
[1:14:33] that she would carry out hallelujah she
[1:14:36] was defined
[1:14:37] by the lay of grace that she was placed
[1:14:40] in
[1:14:40] before the foundation of the world it
[1:14:42] was not the men in her life
[1:14:44] that had defined her it was one man that
[1:14:48] had got a hold of her life
[1:14:49] and that man was jesus
[1:14:55] hallelujah hallelujah you can't undo
[1:14:59] your past
[1:15:00] but you can let it go are you with me
[1:15:05] let it go i want you to say those words
[1:15:07] and let it go
[1:15:09] let it go i would be a bad gardener
[1:15:12] if all i did was keep planting thorns
[1:15:15] and keep planting fissiles
[1:15:16] and keep planting weeds in my garden
[1:15:20] and i would be a very bad farmer if i
[1:15:23] tilled everybody else's ground
[1:15:25] except for mine it's a whole lot easier
[1:15:27] to look at everybody else's hurts
[1:15:29] and take care of their hurts but it's
[1:15:32] when it comes down to you and dealing
[1:15:33] with your hurts
[1:15:34] and dealing with your pain you're the
[1:15:36] man that's on the chopping block tonight
[1:15:40] and paul could tell you paul could tell
[1:15:43] you that
[1:15:44] that he could stand there and he said oh
[1:15:46] grave where is thy victory
[1:15:48] oh death where is thy sting it was
[1:15:50] nobody else
[1:15:52] but powell in the picture are you with
[1:15:54] me there's nobody else
[1:15:56] in the picture tonight but you and you
[1:15:58] are being told
[1:16:00] let it go let it go you can't do one
[1:16:04] thing about the hurt in your past
[1:16:06] but you can do something about your
[1:16:08] future
[1:16:10] are you with me there's a lot of things
[1:16:11] if we go back and
[1:16:13] check out your your past and we'd have a
[1:16:15] record of your past
[1:16:17] we could have all those things i do not
[1:16:19] want you to be defined by the things of
[1:16:21] your past
[1:16:22] you may have drunk alcohol you may have
[1:16:24] been in drugs you may have been in
[1:16:25] prostitution
[1:16:26] you may have went through all kinds of
[1:16:28] things that is not where i'm wanting you
[1:16:30] to look at
[1:16:32] are you with me i'm wanting you to look
[1:16:34] at a book that's been completely cleared
[1:16:38] are you with me i want you to look at a
[1:16:40] book that's been cleansed
[1:16:42] your record your past has been cleansed
[1:16:44] by the blood of the lamb
[1:16:49] oh you're with me you've got to learn to
[1:16:52] live a life
[1:16:54] of letting the people in your life that
[1:16:57] hurt you
[1:16:59] let them go abraham
[1:17:04] and lot when there was a division
[1:17:07] amongst them and the herdsmen
[1:17:11] it was time for abraham to let lot
[1:17:15] walk are you with me
[1:17:19] you see because before lord ever set his
[1:17:21] eyes on sodom his heart was already
[1:17:23] there
[1:17:25] and when somebody's heart ain't in it
[1:17:28] are you with me
[1:17:30] and when somebody's heart ain't in a
[1:17:31] marriage you better let them go
[1:17:34] when somebody's heart ain't in a
[1:17:35] business you better let them go
[1:17:37] are you with me when somebody's heart is
[1:17:40] somewhere else you better let them go
[1:17:42] because if their heart is not in it they
[1:17:45] can do all the talking they want to
[1:17:48] but it will never produce what they have
[1:17:50] said
[1:17:51] but i want you to know that abraham's
[1:17:54] destiny
[1:17:54] was not attached to lot
[1:17:59] yeah lord was with him yet lord lord was
[1:18:02] his nephew
[1:18:03] he was there he was his friend he was
[1:18:05] his brother's boy he helped him out
[1:18:07] but his destiny was not attached to lot
[1:18:11] walking away his destiny hallelujah
[1:18:14] laid in a land that was before him
[1:18:18] he was seeking a place a land whose
[1:18:21] builder and maker was god
[1:18:25] your predestination is not attached to
[1:18:29] the person that hurts you
[1:18:31] your predestination is not attached to
[1:18:33] the devil that attacked you
[1:18:35] your predestination is not attached
[1:18:40] to your sickness to your pain to your
[1:18:43] hurt
[1:18:45] are you with me your destiny is tied to
[1:18:48] a seed
[1:18:49] your identity is not identified with the
[1:18:52] agenda of satan
[1:18:54] your identity is not attached to the
[1:18:56] circumstances of life
[1:18:58] through the disappointments through the
[1:19:00] complexes of life
[1:19:01] your identity is attached to a seed
[1:19:06] and this message can i say that to you
[1:19:09] this message this message pushes past
[1:19:13] your past
[1:19:17] this message this message erases
[1:19:20] your past are you with me sure luther
[1:19:25] he had judged the just shall live by
[1:19:26] faith but in this
[1:19:28] end time message you heard a voice
[1:19:30] saying
[1:19:31] that you're justified it's as if you've
[1:19:33] never done it in the first place
[1:19:35] those people that hurt you those scars
[1:19:37] that you had
[1:19:38] those pains of your past that you had
[1:19:40] it's as if it never happened to you
[1:19:44] maybe it's there in your memory maybe
[1:19:46] it's there in your conscience
[1:19:48] but in god's mind it's not even there
[1:19:52] and if god don't remember it sister
[1:19:54] heather why and the thunder should i
[1:19:56] remember it
[1:19:58] [Applause]
[1:20:00] hallelujah he purged us by the blood
[1:20:04] of the lamb brother branham said in the
[1:20:06] great warrior david
[1:20:08] he said your name is indelibly written
[1:20:10] by the blood of jesus christ
[1:20:12] you're placed there in that position as
[1:20:14] a son of god
[1:20:18] ruth was known as a moabitess
[1:20:22] until
[1:20:27] hallelujah orpah didn't want to go
[1:20:31] let her walk church wall didn't want to
[1:20:35] go
[1:20:35] let him walk hallelujah
[1:20:40] there's a lot of people that's got out
[1:20:41] of line but there's some people
[1:20:43] that heard that voice say get back in
[1:20:45] line and you got back in line
[1:20:47] there's some people that got out of line
[1:20:49] and stayed out of line but there is an
[1:20:51] elect group of people
[1:20:52] that have got back in line with the word
[1:20:54] of god when every devil in hell
[1:20:56] has tried to hurt her tried to stop her
[1:20:59] tried to afflict her
[1:21:01] she got in line with the word
[1:21:06] you see people who are constantly
[1:21:08] dragging you down or hurting you are
[1:21:10] putting holes in your faith ruth
[1:21:13] couldn't go all the way as long as orpah
[1:21:15] was hanging on
[1:21:16] are you with me
[1:21:19] i'm gonna give you a real key right here
[1:21:22] and when you're going through some war
[1:21:23] and you're going through some pain
[1:21:24] whether you're
[1:21:25] whether you are being attacked by an
[1:21:27] enemy being attacked by a cancer being
[1:21:29] attacked by a disease
[1:21:31] you must keep your spirit clean you
[1:21:34] cannot allow yourself to be infected
[1:21:37] by the spirit of the devil you must keep
[1:21:40] your spirit clean
[1:21:42] because the bible said that in proverbs
[1:21:44] 18 and 14
[1:21:45] that the spirit of a man will sustain
[1:21:47] his infirmity
[1:21:49] but a wounded spirit who can bear
[1:21:53] you know when you're dealing with a hurt
[1:21:55] dog he's the most dangerous is when he's
[1:21:57] hurt
[1:21:57] and when you have been around somebody
[1:21:59] that has been wounded
[1:22:01] man they will growl at you you think
[1:22:04] they got the mange
[1:22:06] frothing at the mouth and everything
[1:22:07] else they mad at you i'm mad at the
[1:22:09] world mad at everything else
[1:22:11] because they are a wounded spirit
[1:22:14] you can't stand to be in the house with
[1:22:16] that type of person when they're so mad
[1:22:18] everything else around them you try to
[1:22:20] create an atmosphere and the best thing
[1:22:22] for you to create an atmosphere to do
[1:22:24] is get out the house
[1:22:27] because a wounded spirit who can bear it
[1:22:31] but you cannot allow your pain your hurt
[1:22:34] your trial to get in the boat with you
[1:22:39] are you with me you see that boat is
[1:22:42] built
[1:22:43] to float over the water and go down the
[1:22:45] ripples and go down the
[1:22:46] go down through the trials of life and
[1:22:48] the troubles of life but as soon
[1:22:50] as the water that it was built to float
[1:22:53] over gets in the water
[1:22:55] that boat begins to look like the water
[1:22:58] and when you begin to fall entrapped to
[1:23:00] sin
[1:23:01] and you allow sin in your life and you
[1:23:03] allow troubles in your life
[1:23:04] or you allow the afflictions or the pain
[1:23:06] that you went through
[1:23:08] to become more than who you are
[1:23:12] to override you you have now
[1:23:15] allowed sickness you've allowed pain
[1:23:19] you've allowed cancer you've allowed
[1:23:21] troubles to get into your life
[1:23:23] and destroy the purpose that you were
[1:23:25] built to do
[1:23:30] but the bible said that we look not at
[1:23:33] the things which are seen but the things
[1:23:35] which are not
[1:23:36] seen for the things which are seen are
[1:23:38] temporal and the things which are not
[1:23:40] seen
[1:23:40] are eternal and you cannot allow
[1:23:45] you cannot allow your hurt to degrade
[1:23:48] who you
[1:23:48] are you cannot allow your pain to
[1:23:51] degrade who you
[1:23:52] are are you with me they're sure you may
[1:23:55] have been abused in life
[1:23:57] sure you may have been attacked in life
[1:23:58] sure you may have been done wrong by men
[1:24:00] in your life or
[1:24:01] been done wrong by women in your life
[1:24:03] but don't allow that to degrade who you
[1:24:06] are because the bible said that there
[1:24:09] is therefore no condemnation to them
[1:24:12] that are in christ jesus
[1:24:14] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:24:17] the spirit of god oh hallelujah
[1:24:22] hallelujah first john 3
[1:24:26] 9 said that whosoever is born of god
[1:24:29] doth
[1:24:29] not commit sin
[1:24:32] for his seed remaineth in him and he
[1:24:35] cannot sin because he's born
[1:24:38] of god job said in job 23-10
[1:24:43] that he knoweth the way that i take that
[1:24:46] when he hath tried me
[1:24:49] i shall come forth as gold
[1:24:55] i have it's always been one of my
[1:24:57] scriptures that even though
[1:24:59] one of my favorites that even though
[1:25:01] that maybe i don't know the way that i'm
[1:25:03] going
[1:25:04] he knows the way that i'm going he knows
[1:25:07] the way that i'm walking
[1:25:08] he knows the way i'm talking and he
[1:25:10] knows the way that i take
[1:25:13] and when i am brought forth i shall be
[1:25:16] brought forth as gold
[1:25:25] mother baron was dealing with a patient
[1:25:26] one time
[1:25:28] and he said now now here's what happens
[1:25:31] she gets real nervous spells
[1:25:34] but it's a it's a mental a psychic
[1:25:37] condition
[1:25:38] and you feel like you're going to lose
[1:25:40] your mind isn't that right the way
[1:25:42] you've been feeling
[1:25:44] now what is that now it's not normal if
[1:25:46] there's a doctor sitting close you know
[1:25:48] it's not normal for a human being to
[1:25:49] to act like now what is it it's not
[1:25:52] exactly a disease of the body
[1:25:54] but how i feel like around her is a
[1:25:57] gloomy feeling he said did you ever get
[1:26:00] into a dark place in an
[1:26:02] alley or something and be scared all at
[1:26:04] once or walking in the streets or
[1:26:05] anywhere
[1:26:06] how many ever had that experience of
[1:26:08] being scared there's something there to
[1:26:09] scare you is that right
[1:26:11] there's something there to make you fret
[1:26:13] there's something
[1:26:14] that is haunting this lady that makes
[1:26:16] her feel that way
[1:26:18] but now it's lifted it's gone now the
[1:26:21] lady
[1:26:22] can go home and be normal and you watch
[1:26:25] when
[1:26:26] you watch when you see somebody that
[1:26:28] that has dealt with a certain pain in
[1:26:30] their past
[1:26:31] and if you've ever identified or what
[1:26:33] the source of that pain is
[1:26:35] and you watch when somebody else is
[1:26:37] going through the same thing you watch
[1:26:38] those two spirits
[1:26:40] as they begin to intermingle and they
[1:26:42] begin to try to draw strength from one
[1:26:43] another
[1:26:44] i see it often quite often in suicide
[1:26:46] spirits
[1:26:47] that you'll watch somebody that's dealt
[1:26:49] with depression or dealt with suicide
[1:26:51] that they will attach himself maybe they
[1:26:53] don't even know anybody else in the room
[1:26:55] but you can watch
[1:26:56] those two people because of the spirit
[1:26:58] that's in their life and the hurt that's
[1:27:00] in their life
[1:27:00] it immediately identifies with somebody
[1:27:03] else
[1:27:04] that's dealt with the same exact thing
[1:27:06] it is not you
[1:27:08] it is a gloomy spirit that's hanging
[1:27:10] over top of you
[1:27:12] and you see what that thing is trying to
[1:27:14] do it's trying to control you
[1:27:16] and make you feel like you are a part of
[1:27:19] that
[1:27:21] but that gloomy spirit does not
[1:27:24] predestinate who you
[1:27:25] are and it does not change who you are
[1:27:30] oh hallelujah you see saul the king saw
[1:27:33] all his life he was saved by the random
[1:27:36] set but it came down to the end of life
[1:27:40] he came down to the end of his life and
[1:27:42] the evil spirit came
[1:27:45] and it attached itself because of the
[1:27:48] sin in his life
[1:27:50] he was still saved he said
[1:27:56] but god allows things to happen in your
[1:27:58] life
[1:27:59] to mold your character to make you what
[1:28:02] you are to be
[1:28:04] you see abraham had waited for 25 years
[1:28:09] because god had told him that you're
[1:28:10] going to bring forth a son
[1:28:12] he weighed it for 25 years he went
[1:28:14] through everything he prayed for 25
[1:28:16] years
[1:28:16] he waited for 25 years he longed for 25
[1:28:20] years
[1:28:22] and you can either get discouraged every
[1:28:24] 28 days at a cycle or you can be
[1:28:26] encouraged in your heart
[1:28:28] are you with me because the bible said
[1:28:30] that abraham did not get weak he grew
[1:28:32] stronger
[1:28:33] are you with me that even though the
[1:28:35] promise seemed like it was never coming
[1:28:37] he was still holding on you can either
[1:28:40] get hurt
[1:28:41] you can either get hurt you can have
[1:28:42] pain you can be you can either
[1:28:44] become bitter by your trial or you can
[1:28:46] become better by your trial
[1:28:49] are you with me you can ever let you can
[1:28:51] either let your sickness define you
[1:28:53] i have made up my mind when cancer come
[1:28:56] knocking on the spencer's door
[1:28:58] i was not going to allow pity i was not
[1:29:00] going to allow cancer
[1:29:01] to degrade the spencer family i was not
[1:29:04] going to allow it to attach itself to my
[1:29:06] spirit
[1:29:07] and condemn my spirit and try to take me
[1:29:09] off onto some road
[1:29:10] of giving up or trying to give in to to
[1:29:13] the doubts of cancer
[1:29:14] sure cancer's a bad devil sure cancer's
[1:29:17] like a crab
[1:29:18] sure it's got a spirit that wants to
[1:29:20] hurt you but i realized something a long
[1:29:22] time ago in life that there is a god
[1:29:25] that is greater than cancer that's
[1:29:27] greater than pain that's greater than
[1:29:29] sickness
[1:29:29] and i would not allow that cancer spirit
[1:29:32] to walk into my spirit
[1:29:34] and take control of my life
[1:29:38] but abraham received the promise and
[1:29:40] sarah
[1:29:41] brought forth isaac but the bible said
[1:29:44] in genesis chapter 22
[1:29:47] that after these things that god did
[1:29:49] test abraham and said get ye
[1:29:53] up on the mountain of moriah go all this
[1:29:56] journey
[1:29:57] and take your son your only son
[1:30:00] there was not another son identified in
[1:30:02] the picture as far as god was concerned
[1:30:05] only isaac was in the picture
[1:30:08] he said you take your son your only son
[1:30:11] and you take him up there and you offer
[1:30:14] him up as a sacrifice unto me
[1:30:16] now god did not test abraham to trip him
[1:30:19] up or to make him fall
[1:30:21] he strictly tested abraham to see the
[1:30:24] obedience that abraham had in his life
[1:30:26] whether he would bow to the pressures
[1:30:29] or bow to himself or bow to his feelings
[1:30:33] who but obedience
[1:30:37] is greater than sacrifice
[1:30:40] and sometimes god's asking for you to
[1:30:42] obey him and sometimes i want you to
[1:30:44] know as you're a real son and daughter
[1:30:46] of god now you will obey him as a son
[1:30:48] and daughter of god
[1:30:49] but sometimes it may take a little bit
[1:30:52] longer
[1:30:54] for the whole journey to play out for
[1:30:56] you
[1:31:00] but abraham abraham knew this
[1:31:06] that if god was good enough to give me a
[1:31:08] son even though i was dead
[1:31:10] that even though he changed my body even
[1:31:13] though i watched him change my
[1:31:15] sweetheart's body
[1:31:17] back to a young lady again surely if he
[1:31:20] can do that
[1:31:21] he can raise him from the dead again i
[1:31:24] don't know
[1:31:25] how he would do it but i know this that
[1:31:28] if he's putting me through the test that
[1:31:30] on the other side of the test
[1:31:32] there's going to come a greater
[1:31:33] testimony
[1:31:36] oh hallelujah abraham is not known in
[1:31:38] the bible
[1:31:39] as a man that let down on god he was
[1:31:41] known as a man of faith
[1:31:43] a man that believed god a man that
[1:31:45] obeyed god
[1:31:49] hallelujah
[1:31:56] hallelujah
[1:31:59] but after the test
[1:32:03] the angel lord came to him again after
[1:32:06] he had provided a ram for him
[1:32:09] in the thicket
[1:32:14] and he spoke these words after the trial
[1:32:18] that in blessing i bless thee and in
[1:32:21] multiplying i will multiply thy seed as
[1:32:23] the stars of the heaven and as a sand
[1:32:25] which is upon the seashore thy seed
[1:32:27] shall possess the gate of his enemies
[1:32:29] and in thy seat shall all the nations of
[1:32:31] the earth be blessed
[1:32:32] because thou has obeyed my voice
[1:32:36] nobody wants to go through the process
[1:32:38] nobody wants to go through the trial
[1:32:40] nobody wants to get through the go
[1:32:42] through the hurt
[1:32:44] but before you can get to the blessing
[1:32:46] you've got to go through the trial
[1:32:49] nobody wants to die after themself but
[1:32:51] before you can get the holy ghost
[1:32:53] you gotta die come on somebody before
[1:32:56] you get the holy ghost you gotta repent
[1:32:58] that's your job there's a lot of people
[1:33:01] that want this old-fashioned pentecostal
[1:33:04] experience
[1:33:04] but they don't want to go through the
[1:33:06] trial
[1:33:08] before you can get the blessing baby you
[1:33:10] gotta go through the test
[1:33:14] there's a lot of people that want to
[1:33:16] stand like brother on in this day
[1:33:19] but they don't want to go through the
[1:33:20] child through the trials like brother
[1:33:22] ron's went through
[1:33:23] i heard people say and i stood back and
[1:33:25] think man they don't know what they're
[1:33:27] talking about
[1:33:28] hey hey you're talking from a spot that
[1:33:30] you are crazy
[1:33:32] oh i wish i had a testimony like you
[1:33:34] brother ron no
[1:33:36] you don't no you don't
[1:33:40] i want what god wants me to have
[1:33:44] i know i know what causes patience
[1:33:48] i know i know that when you go through
[1:33:50] the trial
[1:33:51] that that causes patience and if you
[1:33:53] realize what you were asking for
[1:33:56] when you were asking for a testimony the
[1:33:58] test
[1:33:59] calls the moani the moani
[1:34:02] in your life and you can either complain
[1:34:06] and be a moany gripey
[1:34:10] or you can have a testimony that'll
[1:34:12] shake the devil
[1:34:14] right back down to hell are you with me
[1:34:18] you can either be encouraged or you can
[1:34:20] be discouraged
[1:34:23] psalm 66 says verse 10 for the how oh
[1:34:27] god has
[1:34:27] proved us thou hast tried us as silver
[1:34:30] as trod
[1:34:30] that was brought us into the net thou
[1:34:32] laid his affliction upon our loins
[1:34:35] thou has caused men to ride over our
[1:34:38] heads
[1:34:39] we went through the fire and through
[1:34:41] water but thou brought us out into a
[1:34:43] wealthy place
[1:34:45] what this scripture is going to say to
[1:34:47] you as the musicians come
[1:34:49] you're going to go through some stuff
[1:34:52] you're going to go through some stuff
[1:34:53] but afterwards
[1:34:55] are you with me you're going to go
[1:34:57] through some message you're going to go
[1:34:58] through some trials but afterwards
[1:35:02] i'm bringing you to a place of wealth
[1:35:05] a place of health a place of joy
[1:35:11] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:17] the three hebrew children
[1:35:20] they went through the trial of their
[1:35:22] life
[1:35:26] brother burnham said and i know he said
[1:35:30] that they went through that trial
[1:35:36] and after the trial they produced
[1:35:39] the son of god that waved
[1:35:43] the heat away from them daniel was a man
[1:35:46] that had purpose in his heart that he
[1:35:48] would not defile himself for the king's
[1:35:49] drink
[1:35:50] and king's mate but it was not till
[1:35:53] after the trial that he seen the angel
[1:35:58] abraham had went through some stuff he
[1:36:00] went through some things of life he went
[1:36:02] through some turmoil and lot
[1:36:03] but it was after the trial that he met
[1:36:05] elohim
[1:36:07] hallelujah it was after jesus's death
[1:36:11] that we got the resurrection are you
[1:36:13] with me it was
[1:36:14] after cancer you get complete victory
[1:36:17] it was after laodicea you get a rapture
[1:36:20] it was after
[1:36:22] it was after the rapture of the wedding
[1:36:24] supper comes it's
[1:36:25] after the wedding supper we go to a
[1:36:27] millennium and it's after the honeymoon
[1:36:30] that we go to a city that he has
[1:36:33] prepared for
[1:36:34] us it was after the trial
[1:36:37] that the victory comes
[1:36:41] let's stand
[1:36:45] i will not be defined
[1:36:48] by my trial but after my trial
[1:36:56] maybe saying that maybe we try to sing
[1:36:57] that song brother out in the same couple
[1:36:59] weeks ago our god is greater
[1:37:02] as they as they play that as they're
[1:37:05] begun to play yet tonight
[1:37:06] brother josh jones had sent me a sent me
[1:37:09] a note
[1:37:11] maybe a year ago now
[1:37:12] [Music]
[1:37:14] and there was a lady that was there was
[1:37:16] a lady who was dying
[1:37:18] if i remember the story correct she was
[1:37:20] dying and she'd ask her pastor to come
[1:37:22] in she was a young lady
[1:37:23] she asked her pastor to come in and just
[1:37:26] kind of pray over her
[1:37:28] and just kind of lay out the the things
[1:37:30] of her life
[1:37:31] uh the things that she wanted in her
[1:37:33] funeral things she wanted done
[1:37:35] songs she wanted saying because she knew
[1:37:37] she was at the end of the road
[1:37:38] she said but what i want you to do is i
[1:37:40] want you to make sure that when i'm in
[1:37:42] the casket
[1:37:44] i want you to put a fork in my hand
[1:37:47] and this kind of stumbled the pastor a
[1:37:50] little bit so what in the world
[1:37:53] why would you want to fork my hand she
[1:37:54] said well as i was growing up
[1:37:56] as a little child i said i was always
[1:37:59] told we'd be sitting down at my
[1:38:00] grandma's or wherever
[1:38:02] we would go people would lean over and
[1:38:04] say
[1:38:05] save your fork save you for it
[1:38:09] so because i they tell me that and it
[1:38:11] taught me that when i would go
[1:38:12] when i go through this that they would
[1:38:15] clear the dishes off the table and
[1:38:17] they'd take everything away
[1:38:19] that there was coming a deep dish fried
[1:38:21] apple pie or there was coming a
[1:38:23] velvety chocolate cake that was coming
[1:38:25] you see it was after the course
[1:38:29] that that came the best
[1:38:32] came at the end and immediately as soon
[1:38:36] as the
[1:38:37] as the pastor began to hear this lady
[1:38:40] she said
[1:38:41] he said i know that this young woman
[1:38:43] even in a dying state
[1:38:45] realizes more about heaven than even
[1:38:47] some of us old folks do sometimes
[1:38:51] she wanted people to come when she was
[1:38:53] there in her casket and see her
[1:38:56] holding that fort so the day of her
[1:38:59] funeral came and they were
[1:39:00] everybody was passing by and they
[1:39:01] stomached what's up with the fork
[1:39:04] what's up with the ford so as the pastor
[1:39:06] took her funeral
[1:39:08] he said she told me these things
[1:39:13] and he said save your fork
[1:39:16] the best is yet to come
[1:39:18] [Music]
[1:39:20] you see we ask for comfort we ask for
[1:39:22] peace
[1:39:23] but brother branham says he gives us the
[1:39:25] best thing he could give us
[1:39:26] is trials and tribulations he said our
[1:39:29] comfort comes on the other side
[1:39:31] of the river save your fork
[1:39:35] you think what we're enjoying here in
[1:39:37] this realm save you for it
[1:39:40] i always knew
[1:39:44] same as this young lady i always knew i
[1:39:46] look forward more to the dessert
[1:39:49] i look more forward to the ice cream
[1:39:51] afterwards
[1:39:53] brother vernon you're not alone on that
[1:39:54] ice cream deal
[1:39:56] i know the best is yet to come after
[1:39:58] that steak i turned down a steak for
[1:40:00] that ice cream cause i know the best
[1:40:02] is yet to come and so i know that all
[1:40:05] the things that i go through
[1:40:07] that after i go through this
[1:40:10] there's a place that's been prepared for
[1:40:12] me
[1:40:13] that no matter if i go by the way of the
[1:40:15] grave
[1:40:16] there has been a place
[1:40:20] prepared for me
[1:40:23] brother branham said in who is this
[1:40:25] melchizedek he said you had to bypass
[1:40:27] your theophany
[1:40:28] to come to this earthly tabernacle to be
[1:40:31] tempted
[1:40:32] by sin but if this earthly house be
[1:40:35] dissolved
[1:40:36] we have a body that is prepared for us
[1:40:39] that is not made with hands whoa
[1:40:43] i'm going to a place where there
[1:40:46] is no more sin no more hurt no more pain
