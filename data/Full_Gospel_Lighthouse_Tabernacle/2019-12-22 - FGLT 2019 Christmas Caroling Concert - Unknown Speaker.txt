begin to start into the Christmas concert this evening we welcome you to Full Gospel Light House Tabernacle our very first Christmas caroling concert and it is our honor to have our King of Kings and our Lord of lords here with us none other than the Lord Jesus Christ and it is an honor that you would join us as we would lift up phrases to the great I am caroling is one of the oldest of Christmas traditions caroling is is to sing a song of joy and exultation to sing a song of devotion to praise or celebrate in song and even though we may not know exactly how Christmas carolling per se began it is a tradition that is still loved by many it is a heartwarming way to let people know that you are thinking of them it also tends to awaken the Christmas spirit in those that are listening and that's what tonight is all about as sister Cassie would begin to play some Christmas songs as we would prepare to move into these things and that's what tonight is all about a time of singing songs of devotion and celebration we know that Christ was not necessarily born on December the 25th but is a time in which we do not celebrate his birth but we worship that he came tonight is a night about singing and devoting our life to Christ singing songs of devotion and celebration that God is here and that God is with us and that God is for us and I have found in my life that when my spirit is home or my way is daily that it was in times of worshipping Christ when my joy was restored and my way that was once dim was now lit by the light of the world so I pray tonight that while we sing these songs of exhortation that you would find the true meaning of Christmas and that Christ would be born in your heart a new or afresh on this day Christmas is such a beautiful season to see the Spirit of Christ upon the people everyone is smiling saying hello to one another that's kind of hard in the day that we live in everyone is wishing each other own Merry Christmas and a happy new year but Christmas is a time of giving it's a time of joy - time of tradition a time spent with family a time when memories are made and we trust the memories are made here this evening for you it's a time when we seem to add on five pounds of weight just by eating maybe that extra apple dumpling or a piece of [Music] or maybe an extra cinnamon rolls but to me Christmases is a time of love it's a time of reflection when we as humans fall in love again all over fall in love all over again with our maker fall in love again with our Lord fall in love again with our Savior it's a time when we reflect upon the greatness of God and his condescension from glory to a manger from the highest heights all the way to the lowest folks to become be born in a manger Christmas is a time when we fall in love with how Christ was made like us so that he could feel like us you would be hurt and understand bruises like us to breathe like us we may enjoy it but Christmas isn't about Holi it isn't about Santa Claus Christmas is not about the lights or the mistletoe even though we may enjoy that it's not about those extra 15 minutes from Christmas cookies in the oven Christmas isn't about the tree or the presents under the jury but Christmas is about Christ Jesus would say in John 14 and 19 in Matthew 28 and 20 then a little while in the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me for I will be with you even in you to the end of the age Christ in the manger no Christ in you we're not worshipping Christ in a manger but Christ in you the Holy Ghost the hope of life the Creator God Himself dwelling in the human being does not yet appear what we shall be but we will see him as he is we will be made like him tonight is about the greatest love story that's ever been told at this time sister Barbara and sister Ana Squire if they wouldn't mind come making their way to the podium as we read the scriptures over in Matthew chapter 1 and 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man not willing to put her to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily but while he thought on these things behold the angel the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying Joseph now son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring for the son now shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife there were not till she had brought forth her firstborn son then he called his name Jesus god bless [Music] Lord if we could we would fill our hands with all of the wonderful things you've gave us and then we would lift them up and give them back to you [Music] I give it to do it believe me every song I sing every very [Music] I give it to [Music] everything [Music] [Applause] [Music] do it thank me thank Molly every song every praise I agree everything [Music] [Applause] [Music] he was able by the Angels lowly manger the Virgin Mary was his mother Joseph wasn't our Father [Music] they were gonna Beltran [Music] Jesus weary [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] there were same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by dying in love the Angels Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone round about them and therefore afraid and the angel said it to this if you not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy without being for unto you is born this day [Music] and they shall be a sign unto you over there you shall find a baby babe wrapped in swaddling inmates [Music] glory to God [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and truly what a glorious night I'm glad we are not in a competition this evening for the young adult choir and the Senior Choir would have some stiff work to compete with the Scriptures say in in Luke chapter 2 and verse 1 and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria Syria and all went to be taxed every one into his own City and Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea unto the City of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end the taxing of Caesar Augustus was pushing men back into their homeland and because of the taxing it made every hotel room boarding house upper rooms were all filled up and there was no room for our Lord Jesus Christ to be born in the hospital rooms or the decorated rooms of the day only as stable or a manger was available because of the taxing that was going on and I'd say that today in the world that we live in that all the taxing things of Laodicea seem again to make no room for Christ to be born in I wonder tonight if you could speak from your heart and I wonder if there is room for Christ in your life room in your tongue room in your energies room in your family traditions room in your money's room in your house room in your heart or even room in your worship you see it was not the tax that drove Joseph to Bethlehem but it was prophecy that was driving him to Bethlehem we may look at things of the world and think that it's man's doing but all things are working to God for them that love God it will be God's great drawing power that drives you to him it is not a man it is not a bishop it is not a Pope it is not a preacher for no man can come to Christ except God draws him now I want you to notice this that at the birth of a mortal king they are singing and mighty proclaiming that the king has arrived the next leadership is on the scene excitement is in the air if you could picture it maybe the shots of cannons the big guns the long guns are shot fireworks parades because the king is born but at this King's birth there was no people to see there was no persons to sing at the King's birth but God loves singing so much that angels came down and sing to shepherds in the City of David is born Christ the Savior saying glory to God in the highest and on earth peace goodwill towards men you see the first time the Angels ever sang at a celebration was in heaven but the first time they ever sang on earth was to Shepherds at the birth of God emmanuel on earth the first human beings ever heard an angel sing was humble shepherds there was a reason why it had to be shepherds I pray tonight that while these scriptures and these songs are gone over your heart I pray that these scriptures would stir your heart - singing to sing you to stir your heart to joy and myrrh merthin and laughter and may Christ the King be born in your soul and may the angel choir gather around you as the birth of the king of our Lord Jesus Christ is once born again in your heart god bless you so before we sing we actually would like if engineering Katie and jeffanddana could come up here for a second so on behalf of our whole youth choir we wanted to come together and get you guys a gift to show you how much we appreciate and how thankful we are for everything you guys have done for us this past year we are so thankful for the sacrifices you guys have made for the time your money and your energy that you spend on us through every practice and every activity thank you guys for being so supportive and thank you for being such incredible role models and always encouraging and uplifting to us and we love you guys very much and thank you for everything you've done [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you're the song your lives soon [Music] you're here to touch their hearts of gold [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] into place a child was conceived a virgin girl [Music] okay [Music] a baby boy she could not cover [Music] such a mystery just a girl in love you was compelling her to see [Music] [Music] [Music] worthy so their weight [Music] the son of God I say helpless child laughter his parents place [Music] oh they could not comprehend such a mystery just a glimpse of you review was compelling them to see [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the Shepherd's Bell and cane [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah to the Lord God Almighty the scripture say in Matthew chapter 2 and verse 1 as the senior choir comes this evening and makes their way to the podium the scriptures say now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the King behold there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him and I say today that wise men still seek Him verse 9 and when they had heard the King they departed and lo the star which they saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were coming to the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto Him gifts gold frankincense and myrrh and how fitting it is that they would give gold to Christ because gold speaks of deity frankincense speaks of service and myrrh speaks of death it's God's deity in service to die and that's what he was you see the very thing that they brought identified what they thought he was I wonder tonight what gift do you bring him that identifies who you think he is you see it's not riches that's riches is not measured out by dollars riches is not measured out by big names and popularity riches is when the kingdom of God is coming to the human heart changed his emotions and made him a new creature in Christ Jesus and give him eternal life that's the richest thing on earth you may ask yourself but what can I give these three kings came and they gave what they thought he was but what can you give I'd like to read you a story that I came across here just recently there was an elderly lady in 1871 an elderly British lady 82 years young was ushered into her heavenly reward earlier in her life in 1835 her frustration at bein anvil and invalid left her fillings useless and questioning her very salvation what she did next would echo through history as a young woman Charlotte Elliott was not sure of her relationship with Christ not sure of how to be saved even though she had been raised a minister's daughter and the probing question of a Swiss evangelist are you at peace with God would not leave her mind when she saw the Evangelist a few weeks later she mentioned that she could not shake his question but she protested what could she possibly bring to God when he replied that she need not bring anything but herself she gladly accepted Christ some 12 years later in 1835 crippled by illness and constant fatigue she felt saddened by her inability to help a local church his cause remembering her conversion she took out pen and paper and wrote a poem to encourage others who felt perhaps they too had nothing to give just as I am without one plea but that thy blood was shed for me and that thou biddest me come to the old Lamb of God I come her poem was published and she was inundated with requests for it she was gladden to discover later that some copies were being sold to raise money for the very cause she felt helpless to assist in after her death thousands of letters were found in her home written by people whose lives have been transformed by her words her song has been translated into a hundred and hundreds of languages published in more than 1600 hymnals and has reached billions around the world and continues to bring people to Christ even today 60 years later on this date in 1931 a 31 year old man riding in a sidecar of his brothers motorcycle in England finally came to the end of his internal struggle against whether Christ was indeed the Son of God he finally knew in his soul that indeed Jesus was just who he said he was he realized that God calls us to him just as we are and when CS Lewis stepped out of the sidecar he was a new man saved by grace 99 years after solid Elliot penned her words and three years after Lewis conversion the sixteen-year-old son of a dairy farmer listened intently as he heard the message of salvation preached at a revival service in Charlotte North Carolina when the song just as I am was sung at the end young Billy Graham went forward to accept Christ 20 years later Billy Graham had become a successful evangelist and was invited to speak at Cambridge University in England his nervousness over the event nearly led him to cancel it but he was introduced to a con man named CS Lewis who encouraged him to disregard the critics who had spoken out against him and to continue with the revival Reverend Graham went on to speak to an overflow crowd of 2,000 each night of the revival and when he returned to England in 1989 he addressed a crowd of 80,000 at England's Wembley Stadium as always he closed the event with the song that brought him to Christ just as I am never think you have nothing to bring to Jesus that is exactly what he wants you to bring is nothing he wants you just you as you are he can take frustration like Charlotte Elliot's skepticism like Louis's and nervousness like Billy Graham's and reach the world through you just as I am though tossed about with many a conflict and many adapt Fighting's and fears within without Oh Lamb of God I come I come again I ask you what gift can you bring may God richly bless you and we wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] there before the world began [Music] to say more two races from [Music] member [Music] we shall reap [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now bless you hallelujah I'd like to think each one it's been a part of this this evening and blessed her hearts in so many ways so good to have so many friends that are with us this evening and thank you for being here Isaiah 7 and verse 14 said therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel being interpreted is God with us Isaiah 9:6 says for unto us a a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David upon his kingdom to order him to establish it in judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this who is Jesus he came from the bosom of the Father and from the bosom of a woman he put on humanity that we might put on divinity he became the son of man that we might become sons of God he came from heaven where rivers never freeze winds never blow Frost's never chilled the air flowers never fade and one is never sick no Undertaker's no graveyards no one ever dies and no one is ever buried he is born contrary to the laws of nature lived in poverty reared in obscurity only crossed the boundary of the land once in childhood he had no wealth no influence neither training nor form Lacock education his relatives were inconspicuous and an influential in empathy he startled a king in boyhood he puzzle wise men in manhood he ruled the course of nature he walked up on the billows and hushed the sea to sleep He healed the multitudes without medicine and made no charge for his services he never wrote a book in all the libraries of the country could not hold the books that are written about him he never wrote a song yet he has furnished the theme of more songs than all the songwriters combined he never found it a college yet all the schools together cannot boast of as many students as he has he never practiced psychology yet he has healed more broken hearts than any doctors have healed broken was he never mark marshal and army drafted a soldier fired a gun yet no leader ever made more volunteers who have under that his orders made rebel stack arms and surrender without shots even be fired he is the star of astronomy the rock of geology the lion of zoology the harmonizer of all dis courts the healer of all diseases great men have come and gone yet he lives on Herod could not kill him Satan could not to do Sam death could not destroy him the grave could not hold him he laid aside the purple robe of royalty for a peasant's gown he was rich and for our sake he became poor how poor ask the wise men he slept in another's manger he cruised in another man's lake antler anthers boat he rode another man's donkey he was buried in another man's tomb all have failed but he never failed we declare to you that he is the perfect one we declare to you he's the perfect one all men have failed but he is the perfect one he's the chief among ten thousands he is the wonderful and the merciful he is our Saviour he is incomparable Christ he is incomparable in humility in Philippians two and verse seven said he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made like 'no son to men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God hath also highly exalted him and giving them a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God and the father he is incomparable in his love Ephesians 2:5 in verse two says and walk in love as Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling Savior he is incomparable of grace called second Corinthians verse 8 chapter and verse 9 says for we know that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that through that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that he might through his poverty become rich he was incomparable in his sacrifice mark chapter 10 and verse 45 for even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for minute he was incomparable in his power he would say all power is given to me in heaven and in earth GoGet therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you and lo I am with you always even at the end of the world he was incomparable in his salvation he said I am the resurrection no man had ever been able to say this no man since Adam because Adam fell though great in their significance of all prophets of men that could shake heavens and shake the kingdom of hell none of them can say I am the resurrection and I am the life none of them could say destroy this body and in three days I'll raise it up again without Jesus coming to the earth tonight we're lost there's been great men princess presidents ambassadors dictators great Kings have been on the earth but none none could speak alot into existence that would feed 5000 none could die for their own sins but this king but this king was God himself born in a manger and thankful tonight that this king would love us so much men today scarcely would die for one another but this King died for people that was spitting on him mocking him making fun of him writing blogs about him writing all different kinds of nonsense about they he not in spite of all of them [Applause] the scripture says Mary pondered what she was witnessing angels singing the First Noel Shepherds coming from the field to worship Him Kings would come two years later to give him incredible gifts stars would line up the night that he was born this girl would have a testimony that she met an angel yet all of her life they would make fun of her you see today they worship her but when Mary was on earth the rumors were that she had a baby by by a soldier that she was their mother of an illegitimate child she had her critics she met a man about six foot tall dark complected and he was sent from the presence of the Lord and told her that she was to be the mother of Jesus Christ God would need to borrow her womb to be born in Joseph would protect him no hospitals no Kings chambers for this child to be born brother Nathaniel God chose a manger he chose a place where stunk because that's what our sins did I was not him lost without him this world has fallen apart this world is contaminated and polluted with politics and media world wars are are prepping systems are falling apart everything is coming to its end but this baby was going to be born to take care of us you see without him brother Charles we're in trouble without him taking us by the hand Mary would reach in grab his little hands and little bitty hands these hands would change the world these eyes that she would look down into they would change the world God needed to look through a Charles eyes God needed to be a teenager God needed to be a young preacher without him tonight I'm lost Christmas is more than a day to where we look back to a manger Christmas is a day to where we ask the Lord to be in us more than ever before whether it's lights on a house or tree in your living room presents given backwards and forwards of love to one another but the barrier I was going into Barry to to buy my wife's last Christmas present the other day and I didn't walk in and just ask for something that would be just a trinket that could get it through I wanted their best because she deserved the best now if I would do that for my wife how much more for God he don't require my money he don't require my house he don't want a choir land so matter of fact when the rapture happens this building will still beat you but what he asked for is the greatest thing that I could give him that's my life I know what he's remembered for what will you be remember for it's quite a statement you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger verse 19 of chapter 2 of Luke said and Mary kept all these things and pondered them in their heart and the Shepherd's returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them a supernatural God became man where would we have been standing 2,000 years ago where would we have been standing I'll tell you what we're stand our stand today will tell you what you two did there our stand today would have told you what you two did on the days of Noah it will told you where you're standing at whether you'd have been in the boat or standing outside criticizing mother on if I was if I was with

and was willing to give great money for was now a gift to me it didn't about money whether you would give me a piece of bubblegum or a great art piece that piece meant a great deal to me today and meant a great deal to me I chased that piece and now that piece found me and I thought about Jesus came walking on the water and you see that piece meant a whole lot to me cuz he's come walking through some of my troubles in my life when I laid in a coma and they thought I was gonna die and there's gonna take my organs out of my body and harvest him and give him I needed Jesus on the water you see that's more than just artwork to me I needed Jesus on the water and you see that Jesus on the water reminds me that he was there for me when I was homeless and a drug addict and I needed that Jesus I'd like to remind you this is more than a job to me this is more than a building on a hill if this ever becomes a job I quit I want this to always be a passion an excitement to stand here and talk to you about how great this Jesus is to me I'd like to convey that to across this audience when you walk into this building may this Christmas season be he lives in this house he lives in this
