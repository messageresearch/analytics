[57:45] from them all the time of of what God
[57:47] has done right here before your very
[57:49] eyes
[57:50] amen it's not something that's done in
[57:51] just a little room but God has put it
[57:54] out there before the world and we're
[57:56] thankful for his grace and his grace is
[57:58] sufficient
[58:00] amen his grace is sufficient amen God

[58:06] verse 2. amen just like to say it's an
[58:09] honor to be with you and of course bring
[58:11] you greetings from my home church and my
[58:13] father brother Tim and amen I know he'd
[58:16] love to be here as well but he's home
[58:18] ministering this morning and he said
[58:20] send me a text I'm at church and I'm
[58:22] ready to fight
[58:24] amen amen I believe that ought to be our
[58:27] attitude to every one of us not just
[58:29] preachers but every one of us we're
[58:31] going to fight for everything God has
[58:33] for us and we're not going to let one
[58:35] inch go to the devil not one inch of our
[58:38] inheritance not one place God has given
[58:41] us it belongs to him or we're going to
[58:43] take every bit of him glad to have
[58:46] sister Ruth sister Katie with us today
[58:48] and amen I I've been hearing this all
[58:52] through the night and preached this at
[58:54] home right before I left but just feel
[58:56] to bring it again this morning amen the
[58:58] light the season of change
[59:01] I believe we're in a season of change
[59:03] and I believe I'm here to tell you
[59:05] Gospel Lighthouse you are in a season of
[59:08] change
[59:09] amen habakkuk 2 and verse 2 the Lord
[59:12] answered me and said write the vision
[59:15] make it plain upon the tables that he
[59:19] may run that readeth it
[59:22] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[59:25] time but at the end it shall speak and
[59:29] not lie though it Terry wait for it
[59:33] because it will surely come it will not
[59:37] Tarry
[59:38] Amen in other words it's going to come
[59:40] at the moment God has predestinated for
[59:42] it to happen and as we know you can line
[59:45] every devil up and he can't stop it from
[59:47] coming to pass also Isaiah 40 and verse
[59:50] 28 says hast thou not known hast thou
[59:53] not heard that the Everlasting God the
[59:56] Lord the creator of the ends of the
[59:58] Earth fainteth not neither is weary
[1:00:01] there is no searching of his
[1:00:03] understanding he giveth power to the
[1:00:06] faint and to them that have no might he
[1:00:09] increases strength even the youth shall
[1:00:12] faint and be weary
[1:00:14] and the young men shall utterly fall but
[1:00:17] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:00:21] their strength and they shall Mount up
[1:00:23] with wings as Eagles and they shall run
[1:00:27] and not be weary and they shall walk and
[1:00:31] not faint amen God bless you and be
[1:00:33] seated
[1:00:42] amen
[1:00:47] I'm just reading this a while ago and it
[1:00:49] just
[1:00:50] struck me
[1:00:52] it says write the vision and make it
[1:00:54] plain
[1:00:55] that he may run that readeth it in other
[1:00:59] words when you read what God has written
[1:01:02] and it becomes a revelation that this is
[1:01:04] your moment in this time it gives you
[1:01:07] strength to accomplish what the vision
[1:01:09] says now in other words God is not just
[1:01:12] going to give you a word but leave you
[1:01:13] without the strength to fulfill the word
[1:01:16] amen but God's going to give you what
[1:01:18] you have need of in your moment and your
[1:01:21] hour of need now many times we go
[1:01:23] through seasons of life and we know as
[1:01:26] the world that we live in there's
[1:01:28] there's many many seasons we go through
[1:01:30] uh you know spring winter fall summer
[1:01:32] all those things and we know that light
[1:01:35] we could go into it of how light affects
[1:01:37] and it causes seasons to change the
[1:01:40] Bible says in Genesis there he put the
[1:01:42] Sun and the Moon lights there in the
[1:01:44] heavens for the seasons and for the
[1:01:47] times and so the sun will begin to move
[1:01:49] and it'll begin to change and the Earth
[1:01:51] will begin to change amen as that light
[1:01:53] begins to get stronger it changes the
[1:01:56] seasons that goes on upon the Earth but
[1:01:58] many times in those moments especially
[1:02:00] in Winter or or in the dry summer and
[1:02:03] you know we all love the beautiful
[1:02:04] spring or the wonderful cool fall or
[1:02:07] whatever the change of colors but it's
[1:02:09] those winter times or there's summer
[1:02:10] times it can be very long embarrassing
[1:02:13] and it'd be heavy on our spirits and
[1:02:16] things and and even in the spiritual
[1:02:18] Realms we all go through seasons of life
[1:02:20] amen but you know but it's in those
[1:02:23] moments of waiting amen but listen God
[1:02:26] does not waste the waiting times or the
[1:02:28] times of waiting and I got to looking at
[1:02:30] that word wait it means to remain in a
[1:02:33] place of Readiness or expectation of
[1:02:37] something amen it's not just sitting
[1:02:39] there twiddling your thumbs thinking
[1:02:41] nothing's going on but even when you
[1:02:43] don't see it you know it's still going
[1:02:45] to take place even when you don't see
[1:02:47] him working you know he's still moving
[1:02:49] on the scene amen you know you go to
[1:02:51] airplane and go get on the airplane
[1:02:53] you're waiting for that plane to come
[1:02:55] and you can't see that plane it may be
[1:02:57] up in the sky somewhere and but sooner
[1:02:59] or later you're expecting it's going to
[1:03:01] land and come to the gate and you'll get
[1:03:04] on your seat amen so you're in this in a
[1:03:06] place of Readiness or a place of
[1:03:08] expectation and many times we find
[1:03:11] ourselves in a seizing of waiting and
[1:03:13] we're waiting on the Lord to move us
[1:03:15] move something in our life or help us in
[1:03:18] a hard situation or or certain maybe
[1:03:20] Financial things whatever it is and
[1:03:22] we're often waiting from God for many
[1:03:24] things and and in those sea but in those
[1:03:26] seasons of waiting God is still there
[1:03:29] amen he's using those times just as
[1:03:32] effective as effectively as he's using
[1:03:34] the good times and the hard times he is
[1:03:37] transforming us into the likeness of
[1:03:40] Christ Jesus in the times of waiting are
[1:03:43] never wasted they're just a part of the
[1:03:46] process amen but in those times of
[1:03:48] waiting amen you need to be ready that
[1:03:50] any moment is going to change
[1:03:53] because I promise you the season that
[1:03:56] you find yourself in this morning is not
[1:03:58] going to remain forever but it's going
[1:04:00] to change amen it's going to move you
[1:04:03] know I was looking here at Israel they
[1:04:05] went through many seasons of their life
[1:04:07] they would go through seasons of slavery
[1:04:09] they would go through seasons of Freedom
[1:04:11] they'd go through Seasons again of
[1:04:13] captivity they would go through seasons
[1:04:15] of taking the land and dealing with
[1:04:17] things that was there there was all
[1:04:18] kinds of seasons of their life in Psalms
[1:04:21] 137 they they were going through a
[1:04:23] season of captivity and they began to
[1:04:26] read they begin to write about this and
[1:04:27] they said by the Rivers of Babylon we
[1:04:30] were set down yay we wept when we
[1:04:32] remembered Zion and we hung our Harps
[1:04:35] upon the willow trees in the midst
[1:04:37] thereof for there they had carried us
[1:04:40] away captive and required of us a song
[1:04:42] and they that wasted us required of us
[1:04:45] mercy and sing it as a song of Zion but
[1:04:48] how can we sing the song The Lord's song
[1:04:51] In a Strange Land see they had hung
[1:04:53] their Harps up and their song was taken
[1:04:56] seemed like their Destiny seemed like
[1:04:58] their purpose seemed like their future
[1:05:00] was in doubt they were captives
[1:05:02] physically emotionally but to them God
[1:05:05] was far away and they never was going to
[1:05:07] return but that season did not last
[1:05:10] forever amen it was a season of
[1:05:12] captivity a time when they didn't feel
[1:05:15] the worship they didn't feel the joy
[1:05:17] they once had felt before they had been
[1:05:19] brought into a season because of their
[1:05:21] sins now we go through seasons of life
[1:05:24] we wasn't ever meant to be where we are
[1:05:26] through changing of Seasons it came
[1:05:28] because of the Fall amen but what God
[1:05:31] and His Mercy has allowed us to realize
[1:05:33] that these are seasons for our good and
[1:05:35] for our our learning and for our our our
[1:05:38] building up of our character and God is
[1:05:41] working through every season of our life
[1:05:43] and here they were exiled from the
[1:05:45] presence of God but God rich and mercy
[1:05:49] changed the season amen you were once
[1:05:52] taught one time in captivity we we were
[1:05:54] all born in sin shaped in iniquity but
[1:05:57] thank God he changed that season of our
[1:05:59] life to where now we're Sons and
[1:06:01] Daughters of the king
[1:06:04] amen amen when you know signs of living
[1:06:07] in captivity
[1:06:09] or the loss of your dream or or the loss
[1:06:12] of your life or the loss of your joy or
[1:06:15] the loss of your testimony the loss of
[1:06:18] your hope the loss of your fruitfulness
[1:06:20] but remember you don't change Seasons
[1:06:22] you adjust the seasons
[1:06:25] you know when it's winter time you can't
[1:06:27] change the season much as we would love
[1:06:29] to sometimes I know up here you know it
[1:06:31] gets really a lot colder than where I am
[1:06:32] and so what do you do you go put a coat
[1:06:35] on
[1:06:36] but you don't expect to wear that coat
[1:06:38] forever
[1:06:39] amen you don't expect that you're going
[1:06:41] to wear that the rest of your life but
[1:06:43] sooner or later the light's going to
[1:06:45] change and the season is going to change
[1:06:47] and the coat will be put back over there
[1:06:50] again amen see God is showing you even
[1:06:53] in nature that what you're going through
[1:06:55] the season of your life is not going to
[1:06:58] stay the same amen because Seasons don't
[1:07:01] last they change the good news winter
[1:07:05] may be now but spring is on the way
[1:07:08] amen Suddenly It's spring suddenly it's
[1:07:11] changed and you don't even know how you
[1:07:13] made it through the winter but God
[1:07:15] helped you every step of your way every
[1:07:18] part of your journey God has had a part
[1:07:21] in your life
[1:07:23] see God won't leave you where you're at
[1:07:26] always I mean they won't always stay
[1:07:28] there suddenly things will begin to
[1:07:30] change
[1:07:31] suddenly sorrow can turn into Joy
[1:07:37] suddenly change can fall off and freedom
[1:07:41] be released
[1:07:42] suddenly you may be Barren one moment
[1:07:44] and full of life the next moment
[1:07:49] amen suddenly things can take place God
[1:07:52] is a God who can move very quickly
[1:07:56] amen it may seem like forever but all of
[1:07:59] a sudden one moment you're one way and
[1:08:02] the next moment you're changed

[1:25:07] how the quality of having unlimited
[1:25:10] power
[1:25:13] so we're not talking about a source
[1:25:15] that's going to run out

[1:25:46] that the teaching of the words very fine
[1:25:49] but because faith comes by hearing and
[1:25:51] hearing the word but it takes a
[1:25:53] miraculous to vindicate that the
[1:25:55] omnipotent still lives and he still
[1:25:58] Reigns we must have the miraculous

[1:27:13] power but men Through the Ages always

[1:27:20] away gets away from the real living God
[1:27:22] but just before his Junctions are in and
[1:27:26] into a new dispensation

[1:29:27] listen we ain't turned the corner we've
[1:29:29] went off a cliff
[1:29:32] this nation has went off into a
[1:29:34] bottomless pit
[1:29:37] it's in a season of change too
[1:29:40] it's a different kind of change not a
[1:29:42] change I want but it's going to change
[1:29:44] this beautiful nation and nothing but
[1:29:45] smoke bombs and craters
[1:29:49] that's not saith the Lord it's going to
[1:29:51] happen amen so they're getting in the
[1:29:54] atmosphere for the change
[1:29:58] amen Sodom and Gomorrah we've been we've
[1:30:00] been saying it you know talking about
[1:30:02] being among us but now we can say it's
[1:30:04] here
[1:30:08] I mean they fell off such a cliff they
[1:30:10] don't know where there's no stopping
[1:30:11] point there's no place that they can
[1:30:13] stop and say hey we're going too far no
[1:30:15] they can't stop this train
[1:30:17] amen they went off into you know people
[1:30:20] becoming animals and every and now they
[1:30:22] got to ride up it's on the Fox News of
[1:30:24] people who can now identify as a
[1:30:26] handicapped person
[1:30:33] I mean that's that's nonsense
[1:30:36] insanity
[1:30:44] but we notice that during the time of
[1:30:47] this great turmoil
[1:30:49] let me back up a little bit talking
[1:30:52] about the first Junction the first
[1:30:53] destruction the flood Noah's day he said
[1:30:56] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[1:30:58] it be in the coming of the son of man we
[1:31:00] notice that during the time of this
[1:31:01] great turmoil when men's Hearts will
[1:31:04] begin to wax cold and away from God
[1:31:06] women become such an idol
[1:31:09] Hallelujah when sons of God sing the
[1:31:12] daughters of men that they were fair and
[1:31:14] they become a sexual object how the
[1:31:16] great turmoil in this world today we
[1:31:18] realize that one things has caused it
[1:31:20] the Bible said Spirits great spirits
[1:31:22] come down evil spirits and God in these
[1:31:24] people and done these things and we see
[1:31:26] the same evil spirits working in our day
[1:31:30] but notice again not only that he said
[1:31:32] but when when all hell turns loose all
[1:31:35] Heaven's going to turn loose
[1:31:40] that ought to give us courage because we
[1:31:42] can sure see hell turning loose
[1:31:46] we can sure sin but I'm gonna hear the
[1:31:48] declarity I can also see Heavens turning
[1:31:51] loose
[1:31:52] the Seeker being healed the dead are
[1:31:54] being raised the prodigals are coming
[1:31:57] home
[1:31:58] angels are being disapprised and saying
[1:32:01] go get this one go get that one this is
[1:32:04] mine that's mine that's my son out there
[1:32:06] go get him
[1:32:10] hallelujah amen see when the enemy comes
[1:32:13] in like a flood the spirit of God raises
[1:32:16] up a standard against it
[1:32:22] while all evil is going on in the world
[1:32:24] at that time at the same time God had a
[1:32:27] witness on Earth
[1:32:30] Enoch who walked with God blameless at
[1:32:33] the same time evil was appearing Angels
[1:32:35] appeared on earth a type of today as the
[1:32:39] evil is appearing so is good appearing
[1:32:44] if I was you I'd prepare for a
[1:32:46] visitation
[1:32:46] [Applause]
[1:32:50] Hallelujah back there in that evil day
[1:32:53] just before the destruction when God had
[1:32:56] a man out preaching the gospel a poor
[1:32:59] man a humble man a man who had a heart
[1:33:01] to listen to God
[1:33:04] that's the kind of man of God you want
[1:33:07] not to listen to you but to listen to
[1:33:09] God
[1:33:11] Noah was preaching a message that seemed
[1:33:13] so crazy to the world he was preparing
[1:33:15] to Ark a place of safety that was a
[1:33:18] miracle in its own
[1:33:20] listen I went and I went myself up there
[1:33:21] went up there to uh that Ark I said you
[1:33:24] know what I said brother Andrew is an
[1:33:26] honest truth I'm glad God didn't make me
[1:33:28] nowhere
[1:33:31] that place is huge
[1:33:34] It seems impossible
[1:33:37] that a man with a few Sons could build
[1:33:40] such as that
[1:33:41] you know and it seems impossible
[1:33:44] that animals would come and get on this
[1:33:46] Ark
[1:33:48] I've always said this enough because
[1:33:50] this way just bear with me
[1:33:53] perhaps it'll be a doubter during that
[1:33:55] day and you're kind of hanging around
[1:33:56] the ark looking at all that's going on
[1:33:59] and all of a sudden
[1:34:00] Out of the Woods come walking these
[1:34:02] animals
[1:34:04] I'm in line
[1:34:08] call me what you want to I want on that
[1:34:11] boat
[1:34:15] hey man listen it's more than just a
[1:34:17] meme he said you need to fight I seen a
[1:34:19] meme the other day somebody sent me said
[1:34:20] you need to fight like you the third
[1:34:22] monkey that's going to get on the ark
[1:34:24] and brother it's about to rain
[1:34:28] raindrops are falling on your head
[1:34:30] listen that ought to be our desire I
[1:34:33] fight for this body change I'm gonna
[1:34:35] fight for this Supernatural I'm going to
[1:34:37] fight for the glory of God I'm going to
[1:34:39] fight for God I'm going to fight for his
[1:34:42] people
[1:34:45] because I see it already coming the
[1:34:48] judgment is coming upon this Earth we
[1:34:50] gotta get out of here and we are in the
[1:34:53] season of the body change
[1:34:56] [Applause]
[1:34:58] laughs
[1:35:01] amen we're he said no it was working
[1:35:04] away
[1:35:05] Not only was he performing a miracle he
[1:35:08] was looking for a miracle
[1:35:12] oh I love that he putting another nail
[1:35:15] preaching a sermon 120 years he preached
[1:35:18] the same sermon
[1:35:20] boy I can't wait to go to brother Noah's
[1:35:22] Church
[1:35:24] you sit down
[1:35:27] it's going to rain
[1:35:31] 50 years you decide to go back again
[1:35:35] and you sit down
[1:35:37] it's going to rain
[1:35:39] you better get on this Ark
[1:35:42] 100 years to go by and you decide one
[1:35:45] more time to give brother Noah a chance
[1:35:46] it's going to rain
[1:35:49] you know we get mad at our preachers
[1:35:50] when it comes from the same text more
[1:35:52] than once
[1:35:54] what you don't realize God is trying to
[1:35:56] deal with something
[1:35:58] he's trying to get you into a place of
[1:36:00] safety it's for your good it's not for
[1:36:02] your bad it's not for your harm it's not
[1:36:05] for your demise men of God don't get up
[1:36:07] to tear you down they get up there and
[1:36:09] preach the word of God for your safety
[1:36:13] for your deliverance
[1:36:18] get mad at him if you want to
[1:36:20] [Applause]
[1:36:23] I don't want to
[1:36:25] we are preparing he said same as today
[1:36:27] we are preparing for a miracle
[1:36:30] the Rapture of the church the going home
[1:36:33] preparing people getting people
[1:36:36] unburdened from the things of the world
[1:36:38] getting their souls set with the
[1:36:40] presence of God and when Jesus disappear
[1:36:42] the second time in glory those who are
[1:36:45] ready will be raptured
[1:36:47] and we'll be caught up together to meet
[1:36:49] him in the air and listen that's not a
[1:36:51] fairy tale
[1:36:53] that's not a hope so or maybe or some it
[1:36:56] is the saith the Lord
[1:37:02] Noah began to warn the people and preach
[1:37:04] many in life scoffed many of his message
[1:37:06] seem entirely unreasonable
[1:37:09] but he went on to warning the people
[1:37:11] judgment is coming judgment is coming
[1:37:14] God with his great omnipotent power
[1:37:17] we're speaking there and touching hearts
[1:37:20] and touching life he said so it is a day
[1:37:22] he said it had never rained before
[1:37:28] it was all kind of Skeptics well you
[1:37:30] make brother Noah it's going to rain
[1:37:33] this ain't never happened before
[1:37:41] he said there's people in the world
[1:37:43] today after 2 000 years of gospel
[1:37:45] preaching don't even yet know what it
[1:37:47] means to be born again of the spirit of
[1:37:48] God
[1:37:49] they don't know what omnipotence means
[1:37:51] how that God and his great omnipotent
[1:37:53] power can transform a soul from a street
[1:37:56] sinner to Angelic position in God's
[1:37:59] kingdom as a son or daughter of God they
[1:38:01] don't understand it they're too taken up
[1:38:02] infatuated with the things of the world
[1:38:04] flirting with the world don't realize
[1:38:06] that's an evil spirit it's a great
[1:38:08] marking signpost for the people today to
[1:38:10] watch and be ready and Jesus said when
[1:38:13] these things begin to come to pass lift
[1:38:16] up your head
[1:38:17] the season is about to change amen your
[1:38:21] Redemption draweth nigh
[1:38:24] he showed it through Enoch
[1:38:27] the world laughed at it
[1:38:29] but one day
[1:38:31] thunder and lightning started popping
[1:38:34] one day there was no longer invited they
[1:38:38] were begging
[1:38:45] suddenly
[1:38:46] well you said it took it to 120 years no
[1:38:49] it went from no clouds to rain and the
[1:38:52] first Rangers
[1:38:56] started beating
[1:38:58] what is this
[1:39:00] and before they know it they're standing
[1:39:02] in the Fulfillment of what Noah had been
[1:39:03] preaching 120 years and all those words
[1:39:06] begin to run through their mind I gotta
[1:39:08] get to that Ark I got to get to that Arc
[1:39:11] and they begin to run and beat on the
[1:39:13] doors but no one said look I can't do
[1:39:15] nothing I didn't shut the door
[1:39:18] listen it ain't a man that's going to
[1:39:20] shut the door God's going to shut the
[1:39:22] door
[1:39:23] so therefore it ain't a man that can
[1:39:25] declare Mercy's over no God declares
[1:39:28] when it's done
[1:39:29] amen When God says it it's finished
[1:39:34] but before it is every name that's on
[1:39:36] that book will be in
[1:39:40] hallelujah oh my so many things we can
[1:39:43] go through the first Exodus of Israel
[1:39:46] how they how they came out of their
[1:39:47] their season of uh of of of slavery and
[1:39:51] been 400 years in that season seemed
[1:39:53] like it was going to last forever but no
[1:39:55] season lasts forever
[1:39:59] all of a sudden our light falls down on
[1:40:03] a bush and it meets a backslidden
[1:40:05] prophet on the backside of a desert and
[1:40:07] a voice begins to speak to him and
[1:40:09] reveal what his questions had been on
[1:40:11] his heart and why he's even there
[1:40:14] and gives him a word said you go down to
[1:40:16] Egypt and you tell Pharaoh let my people
[1:40:20] go
[1:40:21] what was that that when Moses spoke it
[1:40:24] that was more than the voice of Moses
[1:40:26] that was omnipotent speaking
[1:40:29] and through omnipotence flies came and
[1:40:31] lies came and balls came and fire and
[1:40:34] hellstone came and the death angel came
[1:40:36] by the voice of omnipotence
[1:40:40] Miracles took place
[1:40:49] and come up to the Red Sea brother Ron
[1:40:51] spoke about it last night
[1:40:54] I always love this story
[1:40:57] because it represents brother Brian
[1:40:58] talks about it represents the blood of
[1:41:00] Jesus
[1:41:02] and he said he said he said they come up
[1:41:05] to it and he said it didn't look like it
[1:41:07] was possible to go through it and what
[1:41:09] happened they immediately forgot what
[1:41:12] had happened in Egypt and they just all
[1:41:14] of a sudden they looked at the mountain
[1:41:15] the Sea and the big cloud of dust coming
[1:41:17] behind them it said Moses was there not
[1:41:19] any graves in Egypt that we could just
[1:41:21] die there but you brought us out in the
[1:41:23] wilderness and they began to cry to him
[1:41:25] and Moses turned to God and God said why
[1:41:28] are you crying to me for speak and go
[1:41:30] forward
[1:41:33] and Moses held out that rod and he spoke
[1:41:36] and there was wind began to blow and it
[1:41:39] opened up the Red Sea
[1:41:42] let me tell you something it wasn't just
[1:41:44] a little bitty Gap
[1:41:47] for two million people to go across and
[1:41:49] one night it took a wide opening
[1:41:52] and it wasn't trodden through the mud
[1:41:55] they went across on dry ground
[1:41:58] and they get to the other side and all
[1:42:01] of a sudden Miriam realized hey I ain't
[1:42:04] a slave no more
[1:42:07] because there had been a voice of
[1:42:09] omnipotent spoke and it said that
[1:42:11] Egyptians that you see today you'll see
[1:42:14] no more forever
[1:42:16] I always thought that was something
[1:42:17] because they saw him later the Bible
[1:42:19] says it they saw him floating there in
[1:42:21] the Red Sea but what was the difference
[1:42:23] they wasn't the same Egyptians no more
[1:42:26] they had no breath in their body they
[1:42:28] had no ability to pick up a will not one
[1:42:31] more time they were dead
[1:42:34] Hallelujah when you can realize that God
[1:42:36] can come on your behalf and move in just
[1:42:39] a moment and the Egyptian had been
[1:42:41] whipping you and whipping you all of a
[1:42:43] sudden the voice of omnipotence feet and
[1:42:46] said let my people go
[1:42:50] Hallelujah and you realize hey he don't
[1:42:53] have no charge over me no more it's over
[1:42:56] with
[1:42:57] it's over with it's finished oh that'll
[1:43:01] cause you to grab a tambourine and it
[1:43:04] cause you to dance and it'll cause you
[1:43:06] to have joy in your heart and it'll
[1:43:07] cause you to worship the King of Kings
[1:43:09] and the Lord of lords because he has
[1:43:12] took my enemy and he's drowned him in
[1:43:14] his blood
[1:43:17] he took my drugs he took my alcohol he
[1:43:21] took my pornography and he drowned it in
[1:43:24] the blood of Jesus Christ and they have
[1:43:26] no more power
[1:43:30] I'm here to tell you Full Gospel

[1:44:02] you've come in contact with omnipotence

[1:46:59] yesterday today and forever he said I'll
[1:47:01] never leave you I'll never forsake you
[1:47:04] I'll be with you to the end of the world
[1:47:06] how can we look for anything else but
[1:47:09] the miraculous
[1:47:12] so here it goes down to the Grave
[1:47:14] weeping and then omnipotence gathered
[1:47:16] itself together
[1:47:22] my my dad spoke this here a while back
[1:47:29] he said well Jesus wept he said why did
[1:47:30] he weep
[1:47:32] because he knew where Lazarus was
[1:47:34] and he had to bring him back from that
[1:47:36] place back to here
[1:47:41] we don't understand those things it's
[1:47:43] hard to comprehend
[1:47:45] those just went on they don't want to
[1:47:47] come back here
[1:47:50] I I guess it's okay we get all emotional
[1:47:52] and we wish him happy birthday they
[1:47:54] ain't worried about birthdays
[1:47:57] there's a Day Without End
[1:48:01] I mean think about it brother Branham

[1:48:08] children in the Next Room
[1:48:11] really a healthy body I mean he's worn
[1:48:14] out no doubt been through a lot of
[1:48:15] things but still a nice healthy body he
[1:48:17] wasn't he wasn't dying with a brain
[1:48:19] bleed he wouldn't he didn't have a heart
[1:48:21] problem heart issues her body that had
[1:48:23] wasted away
[1:48:24] he's laying there and he goes past there
[1:48:27] and he's getting to see all those things
[1:48:28] and all the things that were revealed to
[1:48:30] him in those moments and he said all of
[1:48:32] a sudden I felt my body going myself
[1:48:34] going back
[1:48:35] and he's beginning to cry do I have to
[1:48:37] go back

[2:01:49] bringing this down Daniel chapter 2 and
[2:01:51] verse 19 it says when the Seeker was
[2:01:53] revealed unto Daniel in a night vision
[2:02:00] brother Timothy is dark
[2:02:02] it's like it's almost night it's so dark
[2:02:04] but in this night he brings a vision
[2:02:09] he don't leave his people without a
[2:02:11] vision
[2:02:12] where there's no vision the people
[2:02:13] perish
[2:02:15] we have a vision that we're following
[2:02:18] come on now amen in this night vision
[2:02:21] then Daniel blessed God of heaven and
[2:02:24] Daniel answered and said blessed be the
[2:02:25] name of God forever and ever for wisdom
[2:02:28] and might are his he changes the times
[2:02:31] and the seasons he removeth Kings and he
[2:02:34] saideth up Kings what were Kings Kings
[2:02:37] were ones that had Dominion for a season
[2:02:40] there's no command king that's ever had
[2:02:43] Dominion for eternity
[2:02:47] you know what I mean even David he's had
[2:02:49] David the greatest king of Israel he
[2:02:52] lived for just a certain season
[2:02:53] amen men are raised up right now we're
[2:02:56] under a government this government that
[2:02:58] is here and it's gonna that's gonna
[2:02:59] we're gonna go to the end whatever
[2:03:01] happened it's only for a season
[2:03:03] Russia's government is for a season
[2:03:06] amen but he raises so even sicknesses or
[2:03:09] kings are given Dominion but they're
[2:03:11] only for seasons and he'll raise them up
[2:03:14] and he'll bring them down
[2:03:17] he allow under a rule for a moment then
[2:03:19] he'll tear them down
[2:03:22] yeah
[2:03:23] amen you can see it in the children of
[2:03:26] Israel they would go into captivity and
[2:03:27] come back go back into captivity come
[2:03:29] back what was it God will allow Kings to
[2:03:32] raise up but when it was time for the
[2:03:34] word to be fulfilled he would tear them
[2:03:36] down
[2:03:37] amen it didn't matter how big the walls
[2:03:39] were how big it was and what seemed
[2:03:41] impossible that mattered nothing to God
[2:03:43] when it was time for his people to go
[2:03:45] free he tore them down
[2:03:48] and so it is with sickness or any kind
[2:03:50] of spirit of hell they may be raised up
[2:03:53] for a moment and allowed a certain time
[2:03:55] or a certain season but when God says
[2:03:57] it's finished it's over with
[2:04:00] it doesn't matter if it's been years or
[2:04:02] has been monster it's been days it does
[2:04:05] not matter amen the vision will take
[2:04:08] place
[2:04:09] it will be fulfilled it will not tarry
[2:04:13] when it's time to be fulfilled
[2:04:17] so he changes the times and the seasons
[2:04:19] he removes Kings and set us up Kings he
[2:04:22] gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge
[2:04:24] of them to no understanding he revealeth
[2:04:26] the deep and secret things he knoweth
[2:04:29] what's in the Darkness

[2:08:44] some icings maybe some sweet tea or some
[2:08:46] water and a good place to sit down and
[2:08:48] rest
[2:08:49] this is the last Hill listen we don't
[2:08:51] know which one is the last but what if
[2:08:53] this was the last Hill what if this was
[2:08:57] the last mile what if this was the last
[2:08:59] moments here and we just got just a few
[2:09:01] days or a few minutes what are you going
[2:09:03] to do then are you going to push a
[2:09:04] little harder
[2:09:06] are you going to get it a little deeper
[2:09:08] are you going to go a little further
[2:09:11] I'm here to tell you there will be a
[2:09:13] last Hill there will be a last moment
[2:09:16] and we are right at that time this is
[2:09:20] not the time to get off this is the time
[2:09:22] to stay with a ship and sell it into the
[2:09:25] harbor
[2:09:27] [Applause]
[2:09:32] oh you said you're preaching like you
[2:09:34] don't ever go through saying well let me
[2:09:35] tell you something
[2:09:36] we all go through things
[2:09:39] every one of us
[2:09:44] a few more minutes
[2:09:51] I'm studying on this thought to actually
[2:09:53] preach the change of seasons
[2:09:56] and then preach this one the season of
[2:09:58] change
[2:10:00] and on Friday
[2:10:02] of the Wednesday I don't remember just a
[2:10:04] few Wednesdays last Wednesday I was home
[2:10:08] I've been me and sister Ruth been going
[2:10:09] through some things and situations Our
[2:10:12] Lives
[2:10:13] and I don't want to paint it like a
[2:10:15] terrible picture but listen I don't care
[2:10:17] how what what degree you're going
[2:10:20] through it's hard
[2:10:22] life is hard head is best
[2:10:26] I mean sure there's degrees that are
[2:10:28] harder
[2:10:29] and you can always find something
[2:10:31] somebody going through something worse
[2:10:32] than you're going through
[2:10:36] of course the devil wants to point you
[2:10:38] it's like you're the only one doing
[2:10:39] going through this and you're the only
[2:10:40] yeah
[2:10:42] maybe I'm not talking to people that
[2:10:45] you're the only one you know you do this
[2:10:48] that and the other whatever
[2:10:51] so Friday
[2:10:53] I studied this sermon here
[2:10:55] had already had it done before the
[2:10:57] preview the Wednesday I was going to
[2:10:58] preach it
[2:10:59] man the devil is on me because sister
[2:11:02] Ruth just went through some tests and
[2:11:04] looking at some uh the doctor found what
[2:11:06] he calls an audit is a little spot in
[2:11:09] the back of her brain that we're
[2:11:10] supposed to see about June
[2:11:12] and so with that and then some Financial
[2:11:14] issues from different things
[2:11:16] and it just hammered me you know I kind
[2:11:20] of become kind of be real for a moment I
[2:11:22] think it's okay to be real here
[2:11:24] yeah I've seen I've seen it happen yeah
[2:11:27] we believe in being listen I ain't
[2:11:29] interested in being fake
[2:11:34] here several years ago
[2:11:36] I think it was was it 18 19 something
[2:11:38] like that was here we looked at it the
[2:11:40] other day but I'm 46 and I forget very
[2:11:43] quickly
[2:11:44] oh anyway
[2:11:47] I I I you know had in my mind that I was
[2:11:50] going to go into business and do do some
[2:11:52] things and hey it seemed like it was
[2:11:54] working out and I was going to I had
[2:11:57] people that was going to jump in with me
[2:11:58] and come here to this place and I was
[2:12:01] going to preach the Saturday and Sunday
[2:12:03] that was when I was having Sunday night
[2:12:04] so it had been a while back
[2:12:06] and uh
[2:12:08] I never forget it was when I'm open over
[2:12:11] the Ron's for dinner on Saturday and we
[2:12:13] did we didn't discuss nothing like that
[2:12:15] didn't nothing at all just had a good
[2:12:17] time of fellowshipping
[2:12:18] and uh left and got ready for the
[2:12:21] service and never forget he walked in
[2:12:23] the back room and he said it's gonna be
[2:12:24] a great weekend you know had that look
[2:12:27] in his eyes
[2:12:28] I said yeah I'm believing that he said
[2:12:30] uh for you
[2:12:34] I said well praise the Lord
[2:12:37] so the next day we went up on the
[2:12:38] mountain with him brother Andrew and
[2:12:40] their families I don't remember who all
[2:12:42] was there but a good portion of us and
[2:12:44] uh we're up on the mountain we stopped
[2:12:46] at this Overlook and and I was just
[2:12:49] looking as beautiful y'all live in a
[2:12:50] beautiful place
[2:12:52] don't ever let it become common do you
[2:12:54] know well I don't well listen I was just
[2:12:56] in Flagstaff and a guy told me in
[2:12:58] Flagstaff I wish I lived in a beautiful
[2:13:00] place
[2:13:01] Grand Canyon's right there come on
[2:13:06] Things become very common
[2:13:08] saying some of this stuff for a reason
[2:13:09] our services can become common preachers
[2:13:13] can become common
[2:13:16] amen so you know when I was looking at
[2:13:19] this place and we got through and we got
[2:13:21] to go into vehicles and brothers was in
[2:13:23] ones and sisters and another brother
[2:13:24] runs I believe this is the place
[2:13:26] and he began to tell me about how he
[2:13:28] spoke to different ones about their
[2:13:29] businesses and I'm thinking boy
[2:13:33] my little Greenhouse is going to go from
[2:13:35] 10 by 20 to 5 Acres
[2:13:37] I mean it's going to be amazing and he
[2:13:40] looks at me and says but the Lord spoke
[2:13:41] to me yesterday and so I went to try to
[2:13:44] take a nap and he said I couldn't sleep
[2:13:45] went into my office Lord began to speak
[2:13:47] to me about you and he says tell him
[2:13:49] he's not to go into business but he's my
[2:13:52] servant and I'll take care of him
[2:13:54] [Music]
[2:13:57] I'll be honest with you that wasn't what
[2:13:59] I was looking for but I took it from the
[2:14:01] Lord
[2:14:03] and God I have to say God has been moved
[2:14:05] in such a way and God changed things
[2:14:07] even in the financial Realms it's been
[2:14:09] wonderful just trusting him and and you
[2:14:12] know and but then all of a sudden I come
[2:14:13] to this season of time and it seemed
[2:14:15] like everything was just pushing down a
[2:14:17] pipe all at once and I'm just getting
[2:14:19] more discouraged more discouraged and
[2:14:21] sick in my body been like it had been
[2:14:23] like that for a month you know right at
[2:14:25] a couple of weeks now now a month and
[2:14:27] and I'm just like Lord why me what's
[2:14:29] going on what am I doing and and it just
[2:14:31] culminated there Saturday night in my
[2:14:33] emotional realm and then Sunday after I
[2:14:35] led to sing and I come to the back and I
[2:14:37] just collapsed on the chair back there
[2:14:38] and I just cried out to God I said God
[2:14:40] whatever don't let me become bitter
[2:14:43] let me hold let me stay I I don't want
[2:14:46] to walk away from what you've told me
[2:14:48] that's about me I want to stay there in
[2:14:50] that place God but God I need you
[2:14:54] I need you and so I just say they'll
[2:14:57] just come out of me as I pray now and
[2:14:59] you know listen Hey listen a song leader
[2:15:01] don't always feel like getting up and
[2:15:03] leading singing a preacher don't always
[2:15:05] feel like getting up and preaching you
[2:15:08] ought to know that
[2:15:10] amen but God has called us for it is
[2:15:12] commissioned us for it and so sometimes
[2:15:14] we gotta
[2:15:15] put our Smiles on and go out there and
[2:15:19] preach or sing the songs of Zion
[2:15:21] whatever it takes
[2:15:23] and I understand you don't always feel
[2:15:25] like being where you're at you don't
[2:15:28] always feel like sitting in the seat
[2:15:29] that you sit in but if you'll just push
[2:15:31] past that
[2:15:34] and just say God you got it right now I
[2:15:36] can't do nothing about it but I know
[2:15:38] you'll take care of it he will
[2:15:42] he will
[2:15:44] amen so on Monday morning brother Tim
[2:15:46] calls me so I need to go to the grocery
[2:15:47] store and we don't go man I said sure I
[2:15:49] jumped in with him and I go and we have
[2:15:52] a little time of Fellowship he drops me

[2:18:06] out your heart to him but today he hung
[2:18:09] Haman
[2:18:15] today he hung Haman he said but in
[2:18:18] Esther's case that wasn't her deer's
[2:18:20] need it was to spare her people from a

[3:17:08] Done wonderful things here this morning
[3:17:12] things that books are written about
[3:17:16] happen in this room this morning
[3:17:20] because you laid down the pen and let
[3:17:22] the author pick it up
[3:17:24] and let him rewrite your story
[3:17:26] [Music]
[3:17:28] story
[3:17:30] is just beginning
[3:17:32] [Music]
[3:17:33] a lot of times people don't understand
[3:17:34] music in the way that it's played
[3:17:37] I don't think we're going why in the
[3:17:39] world is it why is it getting played
[3:17:40] this way and why is the rhythm going
[3:17:42] this way
[3:17:44] every once in a while
[3:17:46] some of the greatest parts of music is a
[3:17:49] breath
[3:17:51] it's the pause
[3:17:54] and sometimes you wonder why in the
[3:17:56] world is my story going this way the
[3:17:59] most powerful moment
[3:18:01] is the breath
[3:18:03] and the breath of change has come in
[3:18:05] this room this morning
[3:18:07] you are in a season
[3:18:10] but in a moment the breath changed
[3:18:15] the entire music sheet
[3:18:20] the director
[3:18:22] has come
[3:18:24] we're going to let you be dismissed
[3:18:25] today
[3:18:27] there's still some here that are
[3:18:28] worshiping the Lord
[3:18:31] but worship don't just stay here
[3:18:34] I believe you know that by now but
[3:18:37] worship don't stay here
[3:18:39] I was in our car last night we were an
[3:18:42] hour and a half down the road
[3:18:47] and it's all of a sudden we just begin
[3:18:49] to talk about the Lord
[3:18:52] I've always began to Trail off and I was
[3:18:54] in another world because I began to
[3:18:56] worship him as you so I wanted to show
[3:18:58] you this it doesn't matter where you are
[3:19:00] in your conversation worship happens
[3:19:04] wherever so whether it's here at this
[3:19:07] altar whether it's there in that Pew
[3:19:09] whether it's in your car whether it's on
[3:19:11] your job
[3:19:12] worship
[3:19:14] is what brings our lord Jesus close
[3:19:17] what's worship is he thanking him it's
[3:19:19] praising him for the things that you
[3:19:21] don't see
[3:19:22] and the things that you do see
[3:19:25] and it brings him to the scene so
[3:19:27] whether you do it here or whether you do
[3:19:29] it in your car I want you to remain in
[3:19:32] this type of worship I want you to
[3:19:34] remain in this moment
[3:19:36] don't let your conversations break what
[3:19:38] happened this morning
[3:19:40] easily so many times we allow just a
[3:19:43] little
[3:19:44] little quick changes to come and it
[3:19:46] breaks it I don't want you to be sincere
[3:19:49] I want you to be real sincere and I want
[3:19:51] you to testify to one another if you can
[3:19:53] do that for me as you're going out today
[3:19:55] I want you to get to somebody that you
[3:19:57] wouldn't necessarily talk to or maybe
[3:20:00] somebody you don't but I want you to
[3:20:02] testify to them
[3:20:03] you don't have to give them a whole
[3:20:04] story but testify to them that the Lord
[3:20:07] did something for you today can you do
[3:20:08] that for me today while you're being
[3:20:10] dismissed
[3:20:11] that'd be okay
[3:20:13] I don't make you feel funny does it
[3:20:15] there's power and testimony
[3:20:17] so we're going to let you be dismissed
[3:20:19] just now go in the name of the Lord
[3:20:21] Jesus Christ come expecting go expecting
[3:20:25] go believing in the name of the Lord
[3:20:27] Jesus Christ and the Lord bless you and
[3:20:29] keep you in Jesus name God bless
[3:20:32] [Music]
