and who holds our papers amen who holds our papers I don't know I don't how far I'll get but you know Andrew said last night said as a pastor you just preach a while and it won't now it's one thing about it it won't SP that's you know you come right back to it I thought Andrew just did such a wonderful job last night I was so blessed I I was so blessed Revelations chapter 5 and this is very familiar to the bride of Christ and I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the Elder saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four Beast and the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne upon the throne and when he had taken the book and the four Beast and the four and 20 ERS Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hearts and golden vials full of odors which are the the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by the blood of of every Kindred tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign upon the Earth you may be seated amen God bless you God bless you for your patience with us I just want to start at an interesting spot and I think it's very powerful brother bandam was talking about a place to where that there was a conventions of the religions of the world and he just kind of steps into this brother Bram wasn't there he's only quoting from it he said here some years ago they had a religions of the world met and I was reading in a book that they had had this lady makabe from Oklahoma here that's arrested out there that might have been in Tulsa one of these places and she was running through the streets driving stage coach and smoking a cigar and breaking the city limits with a stage coach and all the religions different religions raised up and told their part of of their religion and how great it was and the Muhammad's priest told how great his religion was and the Buddha told how great his religion was and a certain little Minister I can't call his name now was rep was representing the religion of America Christian religion and when he got his time to the platform he told the story of this great foul woman how low down that she was till they didn't even want to get get around her to even get close enough to to her to Tar and feather her she was so immoral she was so degraded there was nothing that could help her and he and he stops and he says Gentlemen of the religions of the world can your religious produce anything that would cleanse the hands of this certain very fou vow person everyone sat quiet right on the end of their seats no man saying nothing and then he jumped in the air and screamed and kicked his heels together and he said the blood of Jesus Christ won't only cleanse her hands but it'll clean her heart and make her pure as a lily the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ takes away sins and cleanses us from all iniquity and makes us new creatures in Christ Jesus nothing else will do it I like that nothing else will do it Creeds and forms and nothing else will take its place it's been try but it takes the blood amen it takes the blood of Jesus Christ and nothing else nothing else will do it what will take away our sins nothing but the blood of Jesus I read you Revelations chapter 5 because it's our part It's the opening of the book the seals are no longer they're no longer hidden the mysterious Thunders are no longer mysterious and we are the people of the open book not just this church but bride around the world small churches big churches people that are on the internet that have no churches that tune into to us we're represented as the the people of the open book The Bible's not closed to us it's not mysterious to us because the author of the book came and revealed himself to the Bride of Jesus Christ brother random would use the statement he says you're not feeding on the mind of a man but you're feeding on the body word of the son of man this was more than the personality of a great personable preacher but this was Jesus Christ coming to this generation to get a bride ready call her out come out of her my people and to call her out to prepare her with a message that would dress her for the wedding supper and to take us and call for resurrection and take us in a Rapture not just for some temporary meeting for eternity your amen should have been better than that that's our expectations that's the results of this message this message did not come to produce a bunch of churches or a bunch of Kingdom Builders this message came to prepare a bride for Jesus Christ now now in deity of Jesus Christ 1949 brother BR says this Jesus comes three times he came the first time to redeem his church he comes the second time to receive his church he comes the third time with his church everything in the Bible travels in trinities he said threes but all in one Christ remember the first time to redeem his church the second time to receive his church the third time with his church as king and queen Amen in the breach he he shares some things with us just to lay a foundation just for a few moments he said the bride the lamb is the only mediator he is the only one that came forth and what did he do now he's back here interceding until his blood has atoned for every person and the lamb knows knows what's written in the book so he knowed from the foundation of the world their names were in there so he stood back here and he says remember he said but done the mediatorial work like this until the mediatorial work till everyone that's been put in the book has been redeemed I love that's enough to shout for a while and it's finished and now he walks out he's done the Kinsman work he is all you know what the Kinsman work was to testify before the elders you remember Boaz kicking off his shoe and so forth he has done all this now he's done all this now and now he comes to take his bride and now he comes to take his bride amen he comes now now his King he is looking for his queen that Queen is no longer just in a book it's no longer just in a book you're rubbing shoulders I love that brother Jim we're rubbing shoulders with one another thank you Lord he says amen amen he said in this book is the whole secret of it wrapped up around Seven Seals oh brother Seven Seals waiting for him to come I love that don't you what is it bringing everything to order I think about our freedom and what it cost I I just want to grab grab something here real quick Billy Graham in the height in the height of of racial dis War stood to his feet and and I so happened to be watching that night and and there was a lot of tension in America Satan always does that because real Christians don't have any prejudice I want to say that real Christians have no Prejudice we're all family and he began to talk about slavery and he talked about you know he said so many people go to the black slavery so many people go to to the Chinese slavery if you know what Chinese were were used as slaves in our in our early part as well and then and then the Philippines and then and then a lot of different places but the but the most difficult was Jewish slavery and then he began to make some statements he said since Adam we've all been sold into slavery and I thought that was incredible since Adam we've all been sold into slavery and he makes a statement he says he said only one could pay the price only only one could pay the price now brother brandham would make a statement and I I want to just carry this for a bit he said now there was a man his name was Abraham Lincoln he said one of the greatest men Kentucky ever produced in my opinion and Abraham Lincoln when he got off of the boat down there in New Orleans he send them he seen them auction some colored people off as a slave a big heavy man a little a little poor little wife and children standing out crying bred him like cattle to bigger heavier women to make better slaves Lincoln as many as you know in the history when he folded his hands and smacked him together said that's wrong amen I'd like to Echo that thought that's wrong and he says and by the help of God and this is a powerful statement by the help of God if it takes my life I'll hit it with all that I've got amen and brother brandom said and he did he said then I think of a great noted man who died this is another sermon he said said believe in our Lord Jesus Christ and his resurrection I think of D Moody and at his death and a lot of have said why is is this death and he said this is my coronation day and I thought of John Wesley when he was dying and and when Abraham Lincoln was shot and bleeding to death laying in a place he said I passed by a museum over here in Illinois here some time ago we drove by that museum not long ago AG go and he says I seen an aged colored man with a little ring of white hair around his head walking around looking and he says after a while he stopped and and the tears running down his cheeks and he backed off and started saying over a prayer and I watched him over a few moments and he said I was walking around too and I was walking over and I said Uncle what's the matter I I not I notice you're praying and he said look laying here and he said well I look laying there and only thing that I could see was a dress and and he said only thing I see is a dress and he said but look sir beneath my coat is a scar of the slave belt and that's the Blood of Abraham Lincoln it's taken the Blood of Abraham Lincoln to take that slave belt off of Meen now I think about the Providence of these two men standing at this spot and here's a man with a with the marks of a slave belt on him he's an older man and he's got the marks of a slave belt on him and here stands a prophet of God standing beside of him looking at Abraham Lincoln's blood and here's a prophet that is going to stand in a place to where that the the king of the throne is going to come and open the book and he's going to tell you you're [Music] free you're [Applause] free and I thought if it would excite a colored man because of the Blood of Abraham Lincoln because had taken a slave belt off of him notice these words what ought to the blood of Jesus Christ mean to the believer when we look back to Calvary and see there that he was taken off of the slave bolt of Sin from our hearts and freed us and we've been talking about the last few night what difference it is Abraham Lincoln when he was dying he had he had an ultimate ultimated he says and when he he said but when he was shot there and this great Cathedral when he was dying in his bed he said turned my face towards the setting into the sun the sun was going down in evening and Lincoln was breathing the blood gurgling into his lungs and he had always trusted God he said hold up my my hands and he held up his hands and he said Our Father who are thou in heaven Hallowed be thy name and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit I know you're not deaf and dumb but what a disgrace for America this week thank God for men like Abraham Lincoln thank God I think about I think about slavery I think about the underground railroad that that begin to be such a huge thing to where that Harriet tman would be one of the movers of that a woman along with many other people that would begin to try to get the slaves to freedom I think I what a what a what a great thing it was and I have to be honest with you I've spent a few I spent a few days this week on my my honeymoon and here I'm on my honeymoon and God is talking to me about slavery and what it's like for Harriet tudman to be inspired to risk her own life to try to get people free and how that she set up an underground railroad with safe houses to get people from slavery that they would have never got out of Amen to move them to a place that they could have freedom and where there was safe houses I don't know where you know this or not but that's what we are we're a safe house [Applause] here and we're doing our very best to get people free from sin from religions from the concentration camps of of religious systems there's a blood I want to say there's a blood that can cleanse not only your hands but can cleanse your heart cleanse your mind cleanse your thoughts it's not just another vow to to bring you to a higher order and we're not just for another church but we're free we're free and you really don't know what freedom is or have an appreciation for Freedom unless you've been a slave and if you've been a slave you know the control the control of sin and habits the control of friendships the control of peer pressure the control of intellectualism the control of Creeds and dogmas and Mom and Dad's religion there's a control there's a slave belt that goes with all of those things but when you hear the voice the voice behind the voice and it immediately responds in your soul that's real [Applause] now let me just spend a moment here they had to have signals cuz it had to be at the risk of their lives they had to leave with the clothes on their back they couldn't pack anything so they had to they had to Risk Everything to leave and so so what they did is their message was they had song signals amen they had song signals and they would begin to sing songs in the fields amen and they would send a song like this brother Denny still away still away I wish I could have got with you before service and had you get ready to sing one of these songs CU as I was studying I was studying on a balcony and I I thought about you I thought about you know they would sing those songs and Ed Echo across those fields do you mind I'd just take a little bit here and the song the verse would go like this come on and hold me just like you told me then show me what I would want to know why don't we steal away why don't we steal away Into the Night I know it ain't right tease me why don't you please me then show me what you came here for steal away steal away it was a signal it's springtime weather's right for us people are waiting for us it's time for us to steal away the owners didn't know what they were doing the owners couldn't understand or they'd have stopped it in a moment and then they would sing a song Wait in the water wait wait in the water children wait in the water God's going to trouble the

peace wonderful peace coming down from the father above amen as I think about this message I think about my own Heritage you mind if I just share I think it'd be nice to talk to my grandchildren just for a little bit glad you all came but I I'd like for my grandchildren would you guys stand just now my grandchildren all right all right now all my children would you just all Stand All My Children go ahead and stand all these little guys I want you to stand yeah there you go yeah you do yeah come come come stand I want this to mean something to you all yeah go ahead that's right brother Ron we've only been here a few months you're calling me your children yeah I'm going to do that a while I I'm just a Doty granddaddy thank you you can be seated you see it was in 1961 I was born and my dad was a part of the grew up in the Church of God movement Pentecostal movement tent meetings everywhere my dad was a eighth child and in my in my family there were women preachers and my grandmother my grandmother was my grandfather was a preacher but he was not one that I would want to be very proud of just now and he was gifted extremely gifted but actually he would take people by the hand and this will sound familiar but his thumb would change colors but but let me just say he didn't live a life he didn't have a life to go with all that my grandmother was a real Christian that's what held solid for many my my father came in contact with the message 1961 you know there even being raised in that Pentecostal or even a uh assembly or even Church of God movement you know he saw all of that taking place but when he came to the message he immediately he immediately began to preach God had sent a prophet and as he be to preach and then he got the Holy Ghost and my mother was a Methodist girl and actually my dad said I can't date you no more because you won't believe the message and she said Charlie give me a chance my mother would receive the Holy Ghost and and she would begin to follow the message they were married after three years of dating I came along exactly nine years nine months later and and so then we had a small house it was a cinder block house and and I remember as a little child and me and my brother was in a was was in room we just had one room there in that for us to to enjoy it and my dad would pray right under our floor and he would pray hours at night and I would hear him speaking in tongues and all those different things and and he was extremely it was extremely blessed man we had an extremely blessed home we wasn't Rich by any counts of any imagination but I grew up believing the message of the hour hearing the tapes my brother and myself would stand and compete try to finish the quotes that would take place and and so but listen you can know all the quotes and you know all the books and you have all the pictures but if you don't have him you don't have anything and we grew up and we went to church listen there was weeks where they have a Revival for weeks at a time every night every night every night if you're a poor person gas is still gas no matter how much it is it's still high and so Dad would run out of money and countless times my dad would have us to pray my brother will hear this tonight my brother my dad would have us to pray and we would pray and and we look for Furs on the side of the road a a kill fox or a kill skunk or a kill raccoon and we would take that thing home home and dad had a post with a little rope with a little thing hanging on it and he would hook that mouth and we would stand there and hold the Animal by the tail and we'd stand there and he would skin it out and we take and sell it the next day or two to have gas to go to church listen guys like brother Homer my dad men of the message of the hour are going to be a testimony to people that are don't have passion for the message let me just say if if you only go to church when it's convenient you're backslid you're most Lo you're most likely lost and need God I grew up in that environment here in sermon after sermon after sermon and you know and and I grew up I was a drum player at 7 years old and and you know people talk to me about not having drums well they're beating on the wrong post I played them at seven years old a huge set of drums larger than that right there I I sat there at that place you remember Sister Nancy you remember when the Believers came out of Canada and they sang at brother fur's church and brother Min Fen came over to me and I was playing the drums and he came over to me and patted me on the back and he actually took the sticks out of my hand and played a little bit himself and I grew up listening to men like Junior Jackson and men like that and listening to George van zberg from Africa I can't call them all it's would be a waste of time to do that but 1978 a guy named ed bcll came to our audience and he preached a sermon and he actually just you know he he was kind of a new BL guy on the block and he just kind of shared his testimony calls it experiences with the prophet you know when I was a young man I I didn't know Christ but I went to church you can do that you know and so I I went to church and what he said meant much Sarah he's okay meant much to me now now I want to fast forward to 1983 three Connie and I get married and she marries an unconverted boy just be very honest with me and even brother Homer would apologize later he didn't want her to marry me and I understand I understand I was unconverted and so I'd walked to an altar but it was months afterwards that that I received the Holy Ghost and it was behind a piano and you were playing the piano and brother Bill Hinkle prayed with me and I received the Holy Ghost amen my father gave me a church age book and a seal book and he said cut your teeth on it he said you go through these books over and over and over again you go through these books that are the most important books beside the Bible you go through the these books you go through these books he would later tell me he said I knew you were going to be a preacher and you need to have the foundation of the message of the hour you'd heard the tape she had been in the meetings but you needed to know what this message said that's right come on and so listen he was trying to help me get my slave belt off right and so we would we would go to meetings and he told me in 83 he said I I'm going to take you to a meeting that I think will be very important to you and he took me to a meeting where Bobby Roy was pastoring the church it was a huge audience there Connie and I were first married and and so the deacons took us in and Connie they took her to the Sunday school class they thought she was too young to be sitting in the meeting and they they took my dad and mom and set them somewhere and they put me on the fourth row brother Jordan I think you were in the fourth row I I was trying to count it a few moments ago you were sitting on the fourth row and I was sitting almost like you are and I was sitting right in the middle and I was thinking brother bisco was an older man and when he bounced out on the stage here he's in his 50s when he bounces out on the stage stage he's he's got bounce in his steps and he walks out and and he's now with a Pentecostal Church they're coming into the message but he's now in the Pentecostal church and he's trying to bring them into the message and and what he's doing and he preaches a sermon called the breach between the church ages and the seals you know Connie was gone my parents were gone and I was just honed in on brother bisc and it seemed like much percentage of the time brother bisc was preaching to me personally and later we would talk about that meeting and he said brother Ronnie said it was like a light around you and I just kept looking and I just couldn't help but keep looking well I was feasting on the seals and the breach and the church age book and I was eating it over and over and over and I knew that we had moved from ausa Street and we had moved from that Pentecost yet it was a a move of God don't take it away that was a move of God bullets falling off of dresses people being healed months of meeting at a time the tongues being poured out into the audience but then men got it and denominated it and I knew that we' moved on from that are you with me now my father took my grandmother and I'm I'm really sorry right now what was my grandmother's first name Clara and if you're fighting what I'm fighting you you know I have trouble with memory but Clara was a precious woman and I'll just I want to go two ways I want to go first of all here she was my father would come to Sunday meals and he's trying to get everybody to see the message now everybody's Pentecostal and everybody's Church of God and you talking about war but my dad could hold his ground brother Veron I say you could say Amen to that my My Little Rooster Daddy cocky as he was could hold his ground with the message of the hour and he knew his Bible and he knew he knew how to embarrass them he knew how to take the word and just slice right in there well my his youngest sister Linda is now a Believer his BR his brother John is a Believer and so he handed a book called The Way of a true Prophet to my grandmother it's one of the original books it's way back in the early 60s he handed her a book now my grandmother saw Visions don't want to go into all of that but she saw visions and she had saw a vision of Elijah the prophet and what he looked like and when my dad my dad handed her the church age book she opened the book and there's William bram's picture she didn't need 10 minutes she didn't need two hours she didn't need two years to figure it out she said Charlie this is Elijah brother Ron but I've spent years trying to figure this out go to prayer and ask God to open your eyes to your understanding God to drop the Revelation in your heart this isn't by some intellectual ability blessed are thou Simon barj for Flesh and Blood H has not revealed this unto you and once God drops in in your heart there's not a devil in [Applause] hell my grandmother became bedfast brother Homer actually went and prayed with her many times and she was bedfast because our family heritage are people that have strokes and I'm not claiming that but they were people that had strokes and she was bedfast 5 years her mother was bedfast 10 years her mother before that was the same way so my grandmother was a person that had to be taken care of 24 hours a day and she was basically an invalet and not a lot of communication from her I remember as a little boy we would go and sit with her dad had couple couple days a week that they would go and sit with her my Aunt Linda would take care of her and I have a reason for this and so but my grandmother would be in that state of being and even in that state of being let's just say when brother Homer came in and prayed for a lady's hands on her and prayed for you my grandmother who was an invilet and she was rolled up in a fetal position would open up and shout in the bed and Shake in the bed and speak in tongues in the bed some of this is a little bit emotional so you just hang with me for a moment that's some of our heritage where we came from when I started preaching I did so and I traveled I traveled the world at my expense I work three jobs I work three jobs so I miss much of my children the last year that I was an evangelist before I come and took this church as a pastor which were 98 and 99 I preached 46 meetings 46 weekends I was away from home preaching this message and I did so with all of my heart and many of those places couldn't even give me an offering but I was thankful I paid for the airplanes I prid for the I paid for the and I did so working as a chimney sweep my father worked with me I was driving to brother Roy ry's church one night when we were talking about coming here the Lord had given me three different visions and I was driving and we were making decisions about being Pastor here and I told Connie I said Connie I'd like to I only have one question I'm just G to be honest I only have one question it's about marriage and divorce how does Homer see it I'm driving on the interstate I can tell I can take you to where it was at Jerry West just died the famous basketball star and I was driving by this by the sign that said Jerry West Hometown I think it's still there on on Route 64 you're from West yes yeah where's it at isn't that incredible that he's here you can't you can't put all these things together and I'm driving by and I asked that question our cell phone rings and brother Homer is talking and we have him on speaker phone and he says I I want to tell you brother Ron because you have a right to know this is the way I've always looked at marriage and divorce you're telling me God a't in control of things I let me just let me just talk about our heritage for a moment we as couple we as people we've taken message books around the world I've taken message libraries when it used to be tapes where you made you couldn't afford to buy them from Jeffersonville and shame on them that thank them for producing but they could we as poor people couldn't afford to to to buy the tapes and and and take them and carry them overseas and first of all many of those borders would arrest you if you got caught and we would pack them in one suitcase Mike Price and myself brother Joe Green and myself we would carry them and we carry them in a bag they would search every bag except for that one bag Hallelujah I preached in China with policemen standing in the in the taking pictures of me preaching knowing what the complications could be I've stood in a lot of places to where that I knew there was great restriction let me just say this you as as God would have it be I preached in a lot of churches that were dying and going toward Dr Dobson and God would have me to preach on the autopsy of a dead church he would have me to take the the the quotes of of the power of the Holy Ghost and and going through the church has to have a passion for its Revival I believe in that with all my heart amen stood places where I knew men would be offended yeah I've stood places where I knew I had to preach the message I've said in I've said in offices with used to be we carried quotes because it was in paper form and I'll never forget one man said brother Ron you're welcome here and the Bible's welcome here but he said that's not welcome here and I said well I'll leave then amen I'll just leave and he said no go ahead go ahead head it'll be okay this time next time you know well I preached a lot of next times there with those quotes hallelu I'll never forget one night I was sitting at a very large meeting huge meeting and and this this pastor told me he said now brother Ron we don't believe predestination the way you believe it and we don't believe in the church age book and he just give me the list of things he didn't believe in and I thought okay okay and he said about halfway back where you're at and he he said about halfway back and he was just watching me preach I watched him as I quoted all of the predestinated quotes right straight out of the church age book and he sat there and amen he didn't know what he believed now I I I say this to you it come at a lot of cost oh yes I've got great friends around the world in the ministry and God's gave me incredible friends phenomenal friends I don't I'm not as tall as a lot of them but I I just say this to you God's blessed me with some of the greatest friends that I could have are you with me as a minister but I like friends that are right straight down the middle that believe this message message with all their heart because it's only this message that will produce a [Applause] Rapture and I have no res I don't have any resistance I have no reason to say this to you but God laid it on my heart this morning if those that even watching in get offended that I call Willam brandom's name they're on the wrong [Applause] channel are you with me and listen I don't care what your background is there's a blood here and you may still be wearing a slave belt but there's a blood here that will set you free brother Kenny I've stood in some incredible places where God has allowed me to stand from China to New Zealand to Canada all over the world let me just say this to you God to back his word up and he didn't quit backing his word up he still backs his word up it will not only heal you it'll fill you with the Holy Ghost I'm an excitable person not as excitable maybe as many but I'm an excitable person I love the passion of this word amen I love worship amen I I love to see God move I love to see people fill with the Holy Spirit but some people would mistake that for go going back to AA Street and they don't know my history they only tune in for a service and then they begin to go well they're they're a zuu suit Street people and then they say things against it what do you think about that brother Ron they got the brains of a cockroach [Applause] i' be very careful that's right when you say things against the moving of the spirit and I didn't say those things for you to quieten down I said those things for you to get looser the Lord spoke to me the other morning and he spoke to me and he said people are don't believe in the Supernatural so I just want to take this just for a moment let me just say we need a supernatural among us we need a supernatural among you you're a young man so your new body is going to be younger as well but you'll never get tired you'll never get tired but there's a guys behind you when they get their Supernatural body change come on Church we're not going to believe in the Supernatural we don't believe in the resurrection we don't believe in the rapture [Music] I'm not trying to get you go back to isza Street listen that's that's circling back I want you to go to acts two that's our promise we have come to Mark Mount Zion this message has everything that we [Applause] need so don't label me ausa street that's right I'm going to do is I'm going directed I'm going do is I'm going absolutely directed sister Katie come now I want to pray for you Hunter come with her amen I'm not finished preaching we believe doing what I talked about the lord gave me instructions to give my Heritage and this morning as I walked back into the office after breakfast he gave me instructions to call you down now at this moment so I'm not doing it by the mind of a man Hallelujah cut my mic off almighty God just now Lord Jesus I ask you that you come and intervene on this situation Lord I Thank you for doctors I thank you for test but I'm reminded of a lady that was being prayed for and they were going to deliver a dead baby on Tuesday and when they delivered that baby it was well now father Bethany Dexter had a baby the legs were too short undeveloped and I told her I said lay your hands on that baby now and when that baby was born Brooke was healthy and well we were told as that our baby was going to be afflicted and he's now a great preacher and I feel the angel of the Lord right now in the name of Jesus Christ you're the great physician and you do all things well and no matter how many test and what doctors say whose report do we believe and ask you right now in the name of Jesus Christ that you'd come on the scene and do a work in your name we pray amen and amen and amen amen amen amen amen Give the Lord a hand okay am I okay for a couple more moments am I okay for a couple more moments can you give me about five more minutes he's here he's here just taking my breath so just hang with me RAB was a seed of God but Circumstances had her bound but in God's eyes she wasn't going to stay a slave to sin T Tamar may have dressed the Harlot but there was higher purpose there was a higher purpose that she had in her heart than playing the part of a harlot she knew that that seed had to pass through her Sarah needed a name name change and God provided for that let me just ask you in your circumstances now is anything too hard amen I want to ask you is anything too hard Peter may have been a naked preacher cussing and using a lot of our language but God knew I'll have him as a speaker on the day of Pentecost it's not what your vision is about yourself it's not what your complex is is about yourself Timothy it's about what God thinks about us hallelujah it's about what God thinks about us it isn't about what the slave belt that the scars that's on your life it isn't about none of that you and I have trouble seeing ourselves seated at a table thousands of miles long but that's how God sees [Applause] us that's how God sees us he don't see us in our fril stuff condition I can't say that strong enough he don't see us in our nonsense s he don't see us in our background noise he saw us before and he saw us after I want to finish with this David I think this so wonderful I think it's just so wonderful a patient could come into the prayer line and stand there and they've had a condition for 40 years and they can't even remember what caused the condition brother brandom standing there it's only seconds maybe maybe a couple minutes brother Brandon what mind reading first of all that patient has to remember it to be mind reading are you with me it wasn't some kind of telepathy it was the author of the book borrowing a body it was I can't say this strong enough it was the The Mighty Angel borrowing a body I I see you get off a school bus 40 years ago I see a dog chase you down the road it's caused the condition now there she's standing she's standing there with this condition that she's fought for 40 years April and in seconds what she's fought for 40 years is going to be over I want you to catch that in seconds that's what the difference is about this ministry you walk into church you walk into this assembly whether it's a whether it's Johnson City or whether no matter where it's at you walk into church you take your place you've been fighting things for years and God chooses to visit you on that night or in that morning and you fall into a Channel of another world and you realize it's not a man that's speaking but it's God speaking to [Applause] you and brother Brandon begins to shake his head because he's having trouble figuring out what world he's in he sees her 40 years ago here and now in her future and she's well she's well what are you saying slave belt come off hallu I don't know about you but if you can come aware brother Jimmy can I use you how long was you gone 15 years brother Jimmy one of the first guys

other morning when I saw that Pillar of Fire come down over him somebody asked me said did you go get him I said no the pillar of fire beat me to him does that mean his troubles will be over no God just says I'll be with you brother Ron when I walk into church and I get saved and I get filled with the Holy Ghost is all my trouble's over no don't get that illusion you're going to have to fight from now to the Rapture but you got somebody that'll live in you that'll help you oh if we could look to the blood this morning this Blood this blood and maybe you're sitting there with scars from the slave belt Sarah they don't take the scars away and don't take the scars away and the Devil beats our minds but what it does is it tells you the value of your freedom sister Kristen it don't take the scars away but it tells you the value of your freedom can I go one more behind you because there's a wh going on right there where you're at sister King there's a lot of scars that you'll have to deal
