thanksgiving in our heart or certainly grateful for all the things that he is doing for us and want to be remembering our pastors he'll be speaking here shortly brother bisko's there and the Lord certainly blessed and poured out his spirit this morning we're expecting the same thing here this evening and we're asking that that you remember the Melton family in prayer and and that are very near to us and they're very they're very much our family and so we just want to lift them up in prayer and we know that God's got everything in his control and I pray that the Sun of righteousness would rise with healing in his wings and comfort their hearts this evening and then it's certainly a privilege to have brother Zack Frazier here with us this evening I'm gonna say how much we love you and appreciate you a dear friend to us and a man he'd take care of that woman on your left hand side there no that's right take care of mama hey man it's good to be in the house of the Lord this evening hey man if you have your Bibles this evening we'll will turn over to the book of Matthew chapter 1 and verse 23 mm-hmm and then John chapter 1 and verse 14 same portion of Scripture that we read from last night man let's speak to the author of the word this this evening father we come to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ father we humble ourselves before your great August presence Lord just now and Lord we just want to Lord we want you to hear our voice crying for the blood father Lord we pray that you would shelter us under your wings father and we pray that that the God of all healing the God of all comfort would come and touch our lives just now father you're the Prince of Peace and or do we know that truly this world would not receive peace until the Prince of Peace comes and though we're just thankful to have that peace in our hearts this evening everything could be discombobulated around us but to realize that the God of all heaviness is right here amongst us this evening and Lord what a sacred hour that we're living in and so father we want to be so diligent father Lord to seek your face that while you may be found and Lord we want to call upon you father and ask God to you a touch our lives or to see every person that is here every household that is represented we pray your blessings be upon your children tonight or we've gathered to hear from you not from a man and so we ask that you'd speak from heaven today minister to our lives Lord and we'll be careful to serve you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Matthew chapter 1 and verse 23 the Bible says behold a virgin shall be with child that's a pretty astounding statement right there behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us John chapter 1 and verse 14 as you're turning there just to think about that that a mortal man just like you and I made out of the sixteen elements just like you and I would speak those words eight hundred years before the virgin mary was on earth I say that there were there were questions that were involved with his ministry I'm sure that there were things that that went around and also we understand that there were there were people that believed that that here Isaiah's prophecy maybe maybe this maybe every person around was thinking maybe this is me maybe this is my daughter maybe this is my wife maybe this they were looking for it and I believe that as children of God we're looking for things to come to pass in this hour and I believe that we're here I believe this is the I believe this is the the last people we know this is last search age but I believe that the young people that are here and every person here is a people that is getting ready to witness the greatest event that has ever took place on the face of the earth we're a people that are getting ready to take a body change John chapter 1 and verse 14 and I don't want you as I read this I don't want you to just think of Jesus but I want you to think of Jesus right now I want you to see yourself in this scripture I'm asking you to do something that is beyond what science has said I'm asking you to do something that is beyond even what the church realm sells says I'm asking you to read this scripture as if God is speaking of a people right now speaking of you and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and of truth a man may God bless his word he may be seated hey man I don't believe that's too far-fetched but I believe that we are the people of this word and the Pergamon church age if the brothers could put that up before us the members of the virgin bride will love him oh yeah we only thank you and thank you the verb the members of the virgin bride will love him do you love him tonight and they will have his potentials for he is their head say he's our head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father in John 5:19 you see that this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride and what a beautiful harmony that is he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it she never doubts it she never doubts it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planet the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the Spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted in the water it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will not their will not the people's will but his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all of his work while here while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the broad his church is himself revealed and it is and it is expressed by the word itself it is God and you see that the church is God it is God revealed it is his word that has been expressed in this hour I believe that's why we read those scriptures and we put our name there that because I believe that we are seeing ourselves in the Bible you see if all you see is David and if all you see is Joe then and Noah and if you do not find yourself there what in what are we doing in this hour we're not just talking about a God of history we're talking about a god right now I thought that is taking on human flesh just like he did 2,000 years ago in the form of his son when he came here and we are watching that God the Great God Elohim become flesh again in this hour and the things that we have witnessed even in our own community or in our own local church here that if the things that we have watched before our eyes the transformations of of souls and the watch their how the dead have been raised amongst us we realize that this is him these are the things that he promised the reason why we believe these sayings and we see these things is because his Bible has told us his Living Word has told us that these things were going to come to pass and that's exactly what is happening right in this hour we are living in the hours of the manifestations of the sons of God and this is a people and a bride who understands their position you see sister Katie can work and operate in my home as my wife because she is exactly that and you as the wife has the Queen of Heaven have the ability to operate in a realm that no other church can operate in because you're his wife so you see these things in operation the manifestation of miracles and healings and and divine miracles that are taking place the reason why these things are operating is because you know your position you you know who you are you have the safe the Lord or you keep stealing and you know sister Katie can go in there and she can mix up all kinds of cakes and make all kinds of different goodies for me and maybe they're not necessarily good for me but their goodies you know but she has the ability to go in there I have the ability to sit there and watch her bake me that cake and put that frosting on top of it it make me gain five pounds by just looking at it but I am watching her maybe she thinks that I'm just getting there watching her and I enjoy doing that as well but I'm also watching her in her position are you with me I'm watching her operate in her position as a wife and she's not hi I've never forced her to make me a cake I never forced her to cook me alfredo or make a steak or what not but she is operating in her office as a wife how much more about the Queen of Heaven when you are operating around that that nobody else knows about and then they think well maybe they're just the odd power may you know that's actually we are hot balls to the world but we are operating in a realm we're not from this world we came from God into God we shall return this earth is not my home I'm just a passing through you see we're all operating in this realm of the natural but we were birthed for a heavenly place you are in God's mind not to not to go through time or not to go through trials those things are going to come but the Prophet said that we bypass a theophany to come into this world to be tempted by sin there's got to be somebody that operates in this realm that overcomes to this age I wonder if I'm talking to such a lady tonight that knows where she's standing knows who she is knows what she's capable of you're not asking too much your heavenly husband is the God of heaven the God that created the Sun the moons and the stars and you have the ability to change situations hallelujah we're here we're living in Bible days again are you with me we're living in Bible days again and this is a continuation of the book of Acts the Spirit has given life and quicken the word that was spoken to us in this hour by a restored word and it is bringing these things to come to pass they say the so this is God I'm not trying to pump you up tonight I'm just telling you who you are you see it's okay if somebody reminds me I'm a Spencer and it don't offend me because I'm a Spencer I Know Who I am it don't offend me when somebody calls me the Sun Iran spritzer because that's who I am I'm his son it does not offend me when people tell me and look at me as a son of God because that's exactly who I am I'm not asked of too much of myself because that is who I am I am stepping into the potentials that he has ordained us to be standing in this hour this ain't a show this is God you're in God's mine before the world began and you are here playing out the drama they're saying to show the miracles that you're seeing this ain't a show like you would see in in men's ministries like a a Alan how that he would he would try to create he would try to create miracles just to stir people's faith Perry green caught him one time when he was he was there in a meeting and there was a a Alan said now this man right here hasn't walked for 20 years he's not walked for 20 years and he was laying there in the cart and hey Alan rich over and grabbed that sheet off of him and that man was fully dressed had a shoes on and he took off running Perry green caught him in this act and he asked him about it and a a Alan said well yeah you know and that was that is true brother Perry green he said but look how it blessed the people how it stirred them played their hearts and their faith to go and believe in a God that can do those things it was just a circus act but I am NOT introducing you to a circus act I am introducing you to the most genuine message that's ever struck the face of the earth you ain't gotta make this up this is reality this is a safe the Lord these things are promised to us you look at the Ministry of this day and you see you see brother branham's ministry when he was standing there and there was a man by the name of up saw he was a congressman had I had a great NAA my major a major distinguished career in his life even ran for president and how he how he'd went through life and he headed ahead I hadn't hadn't walked since he was 18 years old he was crippled for 66 years he got hurt in a farming accident when he fell off a hay wagon and he broke his back but there in a moment of time wins I say if the Lord was spoken he said mr. Upshaw do you have a red suit and here mr. Upshaw was wearing a blue suit and mr. Upshaw says matter of fact I do I just bought it he said thus saith the Lord you're healed rise up and walked hallelujah and he walked until he died what was it it was genuine that these were the things of God when you look at Florence Nightingale Sherlock how that she had dropped all the way down to 50 pounds when diseases and robbed her of her strength and she she sent word Lord let let brother branham come here I'll pay how I pay for these things I'll pay for the tickets to come here he said I can't do it I've already got former commitments that are made here and when she found out that william branham was moving he was flying over to england to preach there and to go abroad she bought a ticket got on the plane and she was almost gone and she went to a spot that her that her veins were so low that the nurse that was traveling with her could no longer get the needle in her veins to feed her from it from a back she'd went solo now anybody can say you're healed but when you say thus save the Lord and all of a sudden you go you go from fifty pounds to a lady that's done to a woman that is that is that is seen as a hundred and fifty five pound woman completely ho anybody can say you're healed but then for a miracle to take place for thus saith the Lord to be spoken over somebody that you wouldn't give a nickel for there lie and watch some resurrect I'd say that this is God that is amongst us this is not a so this is Ella ham at work this is what he does hallelujah miracles miracles are not and that miracles are not Extra Ordinary to God they're ordinary to him they're just natural they come natural to him because he's God we talk about these things and we think my if we could just see those things again we could see those things how it would build our faith I want to show you a miracle an absolute miracle sister Julia would you stand for me all right there's a miracle Satan swore that he destroyed her and packing on the inside of her soul is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's a miracle so now you have seen a miracle god bless you what you say I didn't see that but I want you to know that you came in this world you were born in this world with a nature with a nature to do after sin and go after seeing that all of a sudden something pain and stop the devil's plans that turned that nature that would make you run after the enemy that would make you do ungodly things and all of a sudden because a meeting with him you no longer thirst after the things of the world but you long you long for the things of God I smoked all I walk to and I drink all I want to and I took a drink and I smoke one bit of dope for the last 13 years because I haven't wanted to he came and he took every bit of that desire away from me I'm talking about a god that is a god that's living a god that's with us these things are a paradox they're incredible matru this is him Bible says in Hebrews warned that God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past under the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he has appointed heir of all things and by whom also he made the world's who being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins and sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high what is Paul trying to do he is trying to show that God purposed all things in Christ and that Christ was the Express image of God it is his work that upholds all things that Greek word uphold it means is a Greek word if that of upholding his fearow and it means to bring to bear forth to come to reach to endure and to carry it is to carry some burden to bear with oneself and the move by bearing or to be conveyed conveyed with a suggestion of force or speed I want to tell you that God's got this it is his word that carries her burdens it is his word that takes care of you it is his word that upholds you when you don't feel like you even go a mile on he's got this brothers hand if he got the book in there he'll bring the results he's got this it ain't for me to figure out all I know is that there is a God that is backing up his work this ain't some sideshow that we're trying to introduce and they were trying to say that the pillar of fire is here trying to get your minds who imagine a God that was he's here he's right here right now and we're gonna watch him perform the miracles that he said that he would do God is with us and he's going to perform miracles prepare sister Stephanie [Applause] Alleluia all we gotta do is get ready for it what God is doing in the natural he is speaking of in the spiritual Malibu you God's got this he's the one that upholds you it's his his word that upholds all things you could better stop the Sun you could stop the Sun quicker than you could stop this because God for her Dane did before the world began and he said in Matthew 24 heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away the church has tried to stop that science has tried to stop it atheist has tried to stop it critics has tried to stop it skeptics who tried to stop it but they cannot stop the Word of God nor his program nor his people nor his wife go ahead and give God praise this evening malory this is him atheist mirrors and skeptics may stay in ages may turn the God Almighty he still Jehovah Jireh he can provide a sacrifice regardless of how deep you've stooped in sin he still Jehovah Jireh the Lord provides and he will provide a sacrifice no matter how sick you are I want you to say this he's still Jehovah Jireh no matter how bad off you are he still Jehovah Jireh no matter what the doctor said no matter what the people said he saw Vitara the Lord will provide in an instant of time the sacrifice that is needed hallelujah he's gone he's the one that is amongst us allelujah he's the one that give the vision he's the one that brings it to pass I ain't concerned about it he come to pass his head it's gonna walk man that how it's gonna walk down that aisle hallelujah if they said it is gonna come back here exactly what's gonna happen they're gonna come back hallelujah if his head that there was gonna be a bride that would stand on earth that would be with that spot be without blemish I don't care what the devil tries to do to us the bride will be exactly what the word said it would do because God is with us it's God's commandment this is God's promise you may think I'm far off tonight I'm not too far off check me by the Bible you look at Abraham on the mountain and he begin to look back being a prophet he can look back when he's got Isaac a player he's got his only son a player on the mountain and God is requiring a sacrifice hallelujah he needed Jehovah Jireh that day but he being a prophet could look back to the day that he met the voice that it spoke with him all of those years here he is he's watching a man a man made out of the same flesh as you and I come walking down his Street come walking down there you seek beyond needed to step in human flesh to speak with his son Abraham and what he did is he grabs some dirt and he grabs some 16 elements of the earth and he whipped and he blew himself a body and here that's the Alpha knee that had spoke with him now steps into that body and he grabs two angels and he says you step into the bath that body you step into that body we're going to meet my son he just changed his name from Abram to Abraham and here comes a man walking down the street got dirt all over his feet a man that dust all over his clothes a man and hear this God hallelujah this milk has it he ate of the calf drank milk and some corn bread to eat Wow Abraham was serving him communion ooh hallelujah and he's standing there with his back towards the tent and he said I am going to a point I am coming to you in an appointed time that I'm going to change your body I promised you that you were going to have a son and I want you to get ready and Sarah laughed in attempt behind him and here this God says this man if you can believe it man just like you and I stepped in human flesh and he says why did Sarah laugh why did Sarah laugh behind me because she thought she was too old to have pleasure with her Lord and she denied it she denied that she laughed up her harm sleeve laughed about her having pleasure with the Lord again who out of who she denied him he said been a she laughed here was Melchizedek telling her the very secrets of her heart what we watching this day I'm going to turn my back to the Guardian ow and to see if the same angel is still here now I see I see a lady sees her faith is pulling me her name is mrs. Wiley she's been attacked by the enemy we watch the same ness ayat sign this state this scripture is fulfilled he's not left you here alone God is with us but Abraham can look back as he's on that mountain and he says God's with me God's got this when I can't figured out how he's gonna raise again I still will slay my own son whoo hey God provided a sacrifice hallelujah when there was nobody else were they there was a lamb that stood up for you when you couldn't stand up for yourself somebody stood up for you hallelujah when everybody else was criticizing our Lord he was standing up for Dolores Grimm when everybody else was talking about him he was standing up for Tom hill it's his word that upholds all things he bears all things it's he that's been speaking to us if all you see today and all you hear today is me you have missed it if all you seen was a man you missed it but you've got to hear that voice behind the voice that makes that voice come to life makes this word live if he wasn't with me there's no way that stand up in front of you if I didn't believe that the God that changed my soul and transformed my vessel and maybe a new creature there's no way that I stand up in front of you people and try to proclaim a God that was dead I don't have to do that tonight I'm not telling about a God that died 2,000 years ago I'm talking about a God that raised 2,000 years ago then he came back in the form of a pillar fire and filled 120 vessels on the day of Pentecost that's exactly what God is wanting to do he's one to feel your life that's God's strategy is to feel empty vessels and shake the world bomb how about it young people hello somebody how about it will you let God's strategy go to work in your life the reason why you're here is because God said so the reason while this is son today is because God said so the reason why you come to this message because God said so the reason why you're blessed to hear this message is because God said so the reason why there is an anointing on your life it's because God said so hallelujah when the children of Esau were there in the land of Moab in a pitch there they pitched there in the plains of Moab and the Moabites were afraid because they seen what the God of Israel had done to the Amur heights to the king Sion and all they'd watch those things and they would begin to get afraid because they were camping out in their backyard I'd say all hail is nervous all Hales nervous because you're camping out down here still hallelujah you're not planning to leave until the body change you may you may enjoy talking about death and you may enjoy the idea of time but I sure don't enjoy the idea of dying God is not the god of the dead God is the god of the lift I don't like to talk about being put in a casket though if God makes me go by that way that's exactly where I'll go I ain't got no choice but I tell you one thing there is something that I desire as a Christian to experience with everything that's within me I desire to experience the transformation of this body brother Branham said it would sting just a little bit but you'll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye a body that will not fade away a body that will not perish that God's packet he's back in the victory home today it's this word that will change our mortal bodies I'm gonna be gold whoa hello that's why Hale hates you because you believe it and you're the people but here the Moabites were afraid they were afraid because they were camping out in their backyard but you see they weren't accustomed to the voice they weren't accustomed to the voice like the children of Israel were because God had told Moses in Deuteronomy chapter 2 and 9 distress not the Moabites nor contend with him in battle they didn't have nothing to worry about because God had told him not to do it but here they are and because of this fear that is upon them the King Balak of moba the Moab he because of this fear that they are going to come in and encroach on his land overtake his land that he raises up a hireling prophet by the name of Balaam and Balaam was only concerned with Fame money and popularity I said we've got a whole lot of Harlan prophets in the land today that's only concerned with money fame and popularity I could care less if you ever know my name but as long as you know that god that's on the inside that's the only thing that I'm worried about bailet hired out Balaam to go out there and curse the children of Israel but how can you curse what God is blessed so how even though he'll may be against you how can they curse you when God's already commanded a blessing upon you are you with me the seed and Balaam stood up there he should have known better when he donkey goes to talking to you better watch out I gotta be careful right there some of you know it's okay Balaam I'm still human I'm not going to explain it Balaam tried to stop this he tried his very best to stop Israel but it couldn't stop God's program and Balak hired him out to curse Israel but instead of cursing their me bless them the Bible said in numbers 23 and 19 that God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent have they said and and shall he not do it or have they spoken and shall he not make it good behold I have received a commandment to bless and he has blessed and I cannot reverse it he has not the held the iniquity and Jacob neither had they seen the perverseness and in Israel the Lord his God is with him the shout of the king is among him we are serving a god that has blessed us and cannot reverse it the sound of the king is in our camp the message of the King is in our midst Alleluia is restoring his wife to her full position and it is this restored word that God in flesh is in a person of his broad and is restoring all things we are serving a God that lives and rules and reigns in the hearts of his children you're a son of God you're a daughter of God so stop going around breathing the devil's lies stop going around and saying with the devil told you the devil said this and devil said that you know the devil's a liar so stop whispering those lies from your voice and start confessing what God said about you start confessing these things God snapped the picture of you before the foundation of the world and he knew every aspect and every character is take how fat you be how skinny you be how tall you be house or to be how beautiful you'd be and how ugly you be God knew everything about you I had to hand out on the ugly part but God knew everything about you only your characteristics and you may think that all of these things that are going on score a mess up God's plan God's mapped a picture of you before the foundation of the world and what he thought of you then is what you will be he knew what you were he ain't excited about all your mistakes and excited about your failures God knew what you were before he chose you hallelujah you may fall in sin the day get back up you may fall in sin tomorrow get back up congressman ebersol's motto in life was let nothing discourage you and never give up if a man that was 66 years crippled in that condition how much more his sons and daughters of God said we rise to the occasion to never give up and let nothing discourage us he saw us before the foundation of the world and that's exactly what we're going to be I know you get tore up you're in a flesh you're in flesh you get tore up because you you say something wrong you do something wrong and you displease the Lord I'm not making an excuse for sin but I'm just reminding you that while you're in this world there are going to be troubles and tour malls and you are going to get down on yourself there's going to be times when you're displeased with yourself but I want you to grab this picture of an eighteen or twenty-one year old man a woman that God snapped of you before the foundation of the world I want you to see that person when you get this please God is still going to have the exact development of what he thought of you before the foundation of the world you may get sick you may get cancer you may get all kinds of things that are ailments that are wrong with you but that will not just or the picture that God took select sickness come wait left or Morcar what can separate me from the image that God ordained me to be Bible said I was ordained and I happen to believe it the Bible said that I was blessed to be standing here and I believe it you get down on yourself and we'll give you some words to speak I want you to speak them till you believe them you're going to write them down if you want to it'd probably be good for you if you ain't got a pen just go ahead and get your phone I know you got it in your

you to remind yourself of these when fear comes I want you to remind yourself of these God is with us and we're going to see miracles so if we're going to see miracles we got to stop saying what the devil says if we're going to see miracles by the time we got stopped saying with the devil says are you with me we got to stop whispering lies of the devil and start speaking what God has said we're going to see miracles sister Gabrielle we're going to see miracles so we're going to say what the word says no matter how I feel no matter how my emotions are on how we're going on the roller coaster

Holy Ghost stop beating yourself up over the things that you did yeah you can beat yourself up for rolling up joints stop beating yourself up about it there's a blood for you if I didn't believe that I wouldn't be standing here when I believe that this blood is so perfect hallelujah the body had to die so that he could wash you and not only wash you but forgive you but not only forgive you justify
