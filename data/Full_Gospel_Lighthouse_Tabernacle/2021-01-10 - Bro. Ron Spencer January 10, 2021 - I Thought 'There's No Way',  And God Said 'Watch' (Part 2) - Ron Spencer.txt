sarah come here honey and she gets isaac and comes along isaac gets jacob jacob gets jose and he said that's that that daddy saw whose builder and maker is god i walked about on the earth looking for a city to come whose builder and maker was god and now i'm coming near the gates although the great man that they were they could not conquer it it taken one to come down to do the conquering though abraham conquered difficult isaac and jacob and joseph but there was only one who could conquer sin that was him the lord jesus and as they seen the light from the inside the city and the great pearly gates are shining jesus in the forefront marching on and the angels begin to send to the top of the buildings and they looked coming and the old testament saints cried out open up the everlasting gates and be open and let the king of glory come in the mighty conqueror and the angel screamed back and said who is this king of glory [Music] and the old testament saints cry up the lord of hosts

[Applause] the ways to keep on telling me time and time again boy you'll never win you'll never win but the voice of truth tells me a different story the voice of truth [Applause] says do not be afraid and the voice of truth says this is for my glory out of all the voices calling out to me but i would choose [Music] just a sling and a storm surrounded by the sound of a thousand warriors shaking in their armor [Music] reminding me [Music] the giant keeps on telling me time and time again [Music] says says this is for my glory out upon the voices calling out to me [Music] but the voice of truth tells me different story the voice of truth says [Music] says this is all thy glory out of all the voices coming out to me [Music] aren't you glad you chose to listen and believe that voice

[Applause] [Music] hallelujah amen what a powerful name that it is amen hallelujah i was just standing there thinking maybe i could use his mic and i would sound that good and after a while i figured out it's not the mic and so good to be in the house of the lord in it amen would you greet your neighbor there as you're standing there this morning and we've come to have church and amen all of those that are with us by the way of uh whatever we're glad to have you with us this morning and we love you with all of our hearts and so he's so good to us and good to be in the house of the lord i was thinking this morning as we were on our way to church and i was thinking we're coming to the last sundays here on this realm we can see what's going on around us and we can see the world as it's making its moves and politics is making its moves and sodom as it's making its moves but the bride's in good shape hallelujah hallelujah amen everything is exactly as it is supposed to be it's ordained of god to be that way and so amen the world's doing their nonsense and all of that and and uh you see each man even as christians we're to respect whoever is in administration they respected the pilot they respected they told them to caesar respect that so you know as christians we just move right from one spot to another spot and we pray for our leaders and uh regardless of who they are and what affiliation they are you just move right into that because i want this world to be as peaceable as it can be until we get to leave but we can see the transitioning of the end of the gentile dispensation and these are the things that we're that were supposed to happen and we're watching it take place and and uh i'm just gla i'm just glad to be here amen i'm glad to be standing in a realm to where that we're overcomers of this age and you say well brother ron i haven't done anything great supernatural you're here you're here aren't you you're here aren't you that tells you a whole lot about where you're at amen a desire to come on a sunday morning and we appreciate last night's service and the other part of the church and they're watching this morning and now on the other's place but andrew did a phenomenal job last night that you know and so we we just so enjoyed that this morning i'd like to take from last sunday part two if we could do that just kind of pick up where we left off and and i want to speak on watch amen watch psalms chapter 118 and verse 22 and i've got some pretty important scriptures that i want to read as we begin this this morning and we love you with all of our hearts amen amen you love the lord the stone which the builders refused is become the head of the corner this is the lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes i want you to catch that scripture this is the lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it in matthew chapter 13 and verse 11 if you will turn there with me this morning or sister crystal matthew 11 or 13 verse 11. now he's speaking to his disciples now so he's speaking to you and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god that's quite a statement it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath therefore speak i to them in parables because they seeing see not hearing hear not neither do they understand he's simply saying they have their denominational filter they have their pharisees sadducee filter their baptist whatever filter and cannot see the opening of the word same scriptures can't see it and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and see and ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is wax gross and their eyes are their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lester anytime they should see with their eyes and with their ear here with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them blessed are your eyes i would like for you to grab that blessed are your eyes for they see your ears for they hear for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see these things those things which you see and and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them you may be seated may the lord bless in the reading of his word amen god bless you god bless you this morning in first john chapter one and this is going to be a thing first john chapter 1 and verse 1. that which was from the beginning which you have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we seen it and bear witness so they stood there in the prophecy of it and their eyes saw the fulfillment of it catch it now one thing for it to be prophecy and you grab a hold of the revelation of that another thing for you to stand in the fulfillment of that prophecy and grab a hold of that and then after the event you become the witnesses the witnesses of it now you'll remember only just a few days ago we were we were in the season of a christmas season and we spoke to you of how that those shepherds wyatt had to be shepherds and these shepherds were in the field and angels came listen that's never been recorded ever before in history angels came and visited those shepherds and those shepherds received the most triumphant news that ever was in the history of humanity that the savior is born this day something had to be in their heart to grab a hold of that visitation first of all that they could believe the visitation then receive the message of the hour and then make the journey to where the babe was prophesied to be born at are you with me now greater than a gps god led them to the exact stable and it was exactly like the angel said i like it how accurate god is when we had a messenger here on the scene and he would say and your name is so-and-so that's right and you're living so and so that's right and you're praying for a baby that's right it's your daughter's baby that's right and they live and they would tell them where they would live up up to 20 some things in just a matter of a paragraph and not one of them wrong amen amen just this last was it last week or two weeks ago they measured the horns again in brother branham's library all you guys are hunters here and and they're still 42 inches and if you remember what brother biscuit said it hadn't they been 42 point a quarter i wouldn't have believed it he said i wouldn't be standing here today if it would have been off a quarter of an inch but because it was exactly 42 inches god's accurate in his word didn't he now watch this jesus jesus would say in luke chapter 9 and verse 23 and he said unto them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it only jesus could say it quite like that for what is a man advantaged if he gained the whole world and lose himself or be a castaway i think one of the greatest wastes of our humanity is a wasted life are you with me and i'm not talking about what you attain with money or what you attain with power but to waste your life for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed and he shall come in his own glory and in his father's glory of the holy angels now i want to just capture these next words god bless you for being with us today but i will tell you of a truth that there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of are you god me now listen there was a lot of people standing there but they were not conscious of what was going on are you with me now listen listen we just had quite enough disturbance in washington this week but look past what you saw look past all of that there's a lot of transition that's going on in the world and jesus was standing there in great transition listen the greatest king that ever lived was standing there with his disciples and said some of you that are standing here will not taste death until you see the kingdom are you with me hundreds of people no doubt heard those words but they were not conscious that the kingdom redemption was getting ready to take place are you with me you're talking about a riot when they take jesus and they have barabbas on one side and jesus on the other jesus healed many of those people sick many of those people he fed them and and and literally spoke to them and they saw the miracles but the spirit of the movement of that day scream for free barabbas what shall we do with this man crucify him now let me just say this to you don't get yourself all worked up with the politics of things those disciples that were standing there if they could only be conscious this is the way that it's supposed to be no doubt as they looked at the neighbors your child was healed how could you be screaming crucify him just only a few days ago you pulled palm branches down but the disciples knew where they were standing mary with a visitation now past 30 years she knew she visited was visited by an angel sometimes you think well i've got to have a hundred people around me to crutch me up and know the same thing let me just say you and god are a majority and when the devil comes to you and you're all by yourself and you're being beat around the stump by the enemy you take him back to the spot to where you met god you take him back to the event you know that you met god you don't need a psychologist to tell you that you know that he changed your life and let me just say this to you it didn't take him 10 years to do it it didn't take him had been taking sending you through all kind of analytics and all kinds of things to do it in a moment in a moment you went from being one life to another life [Applause] how do you explain the supernatural birth it's kind of like walking out of a phenomenal service and you've shouted you spoke in tongues you've been moved by the presence of god and then you go to burger king how do you explain to the man behind the counter and get him to get a reality of the atmosphere that you've just been in but you know that you know that you know that you've experienced another level with god and jesus said in verse 58 he said foxes have holes birds have nests but the son of man hath not were to lay his head yet he owned it all and in your consciousness of the things that you have that could be taken away by a hospital bill taken away by by simply politics or simply just life so foxes have holes birds have nests are you with me and i preached in places where that i lay i laid on dirt floors didn't bother me whatsoever jesus did that but let me just say this to you this is not our home [Applause] this is only a temporary this is only a temporary existence [Applause] the son of man had no place to lay his head and he said unto one to another follow me now this i'm not talking about two thousand years ago follow me i want to talk to you about your commitment just now because some people follow only by association or by convenience or if it's working out well but god wants your whole heart he wants your everything are you with me now he wants your whole life watch what he does and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom a couple weeks ago we had three speakers in one service and they it was a kind of a theme don't look back lot's wife looked back i think of all of the testament scriptures that jesus talks about in the old testament he mentions one woman in the revealing of the son of man he says remember lot's wife so jesus gives us a warning he gives us a warning and if you i'm not going to go there but if you'll remember melchizedek spent time with abraham and abraham negotiated if there's 50 there can you spare the city orpha's 40 or first 30 or first 20 we could say the same thing about america or any other nation god could you spare it god could you spare it but there came a time where the negotiation phase was over and the angel went to get abraham's family and and and and lot and his wife and his daughters left but can you imagine the the state of the spirituality of lot when sodom and gomorrah was screaming for those two angels that they could come and and have relationship with those angels lot offered them his daughters let me just say no matter how bad this world is make sure you've got a holy ghost token over your home i refuse to give up my children and my grandchildren that's the greatest lineage that we can have in this day talking about being fit we've just transitioned into a new year and a lot of people want to go get fit they want to transform their bodies in a matter of six to eight weeks and try a new diet but i think for our heavenly experience i think there's a real fitness would you actually fit in the kingdom of heaven would you actually fit not just fitness would you actually fit man said i i'm going to take my tobacco to heaven with me and the preacher said you'll have to go to hell to spite in a place where there's no sin and no lying and no cheating you can't take your adulterous atmosphere with you in a place to where that that is absolutely peace you can't take this political atmosphere with you listen our king is king hallelujah and that will not change for the eternities in psalms chapter 68 and i want to go to the passion translation if i can do this for you if you can be patient with me in verse 19 it says what a glorious god he gives us salvation over and over then daily he carries our burdens paul's in his presence our god is mighty god who saves us over and over for the lord yahweh rescues us from the ways of death many times oh i love this next verse but he will crush every enemy shattering their strength he will make heads roll come on preach with me he will make heads rule for they refuse to repent of their stubborn and sinful ways now let me just let me just say this to you if we reflect our father if we're part of god and we reflect our father how much more are we passionate about destroying the enemy because you have got to destroy him or he will destroy you your your petty petty sins that you fool with and just pamper along and do you know that the the stubbornness and jealousy are you actually your enemy you just come through the christmas season and sometimes somebody got a better present than you did and you remember when you were little you kind of felt a little something roll up in you you grew up and kind of got over that thing but you watch grown-ups if they're not really born again they'll get jealous come on church they'll get jealous of one another jealous of power jealous of this or that are you with me now well god's better than them than they are to me you don't understand the economy of god are you with me it's more blessed to give than to receive hallelujah are you with me now this is more than about a little john deere tractor playing around on the floor god wants you to conquer that enemy in your life all right unless you can see your brother blessed how can you be blessed [Applause] you want forgiveness yet you won't forgive you want mercy but you don't want to give mercy who are you preaching to somebody somebody are you with me now poor people on the internet maybe it's them forgiveness as you place it into the justification file as though it never happened in the first place are you with me no mortal has a right to stand in the presence of god and condemn another mortal is that right sometimes we just need to get over ourself because our self is the biggest enemy well brother ron you were talking about prophecy and fulfillment just a few moments ago but you've got to be fit to be able to when you're standing at the moment realize that this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears rapture's imminent it's absolutely imminent we've looked for it for 2 000 years and now it's just imminent this has always been one of my favorite scriptures but especially in this phase of my life it's taken on new meaning as a stage four you know stage four puts a different perspective on everything you know i hear people i hear prayer requests come across the pulpit go they're they're thinking it might be cancer and there's a fear you can almost sense it in the prayer request you're going for a scan or you're going and then they tell you no no no it's just it's benign and you rejoice and you rejoice and you rejoice i've lived now a year i'm coming up on an anniversary of a year of being told you have stage four one phase he told me i'd live about four months i'm getting stronger as we go we're not dealing just with cancer on a toe we're dealing with brain cancer lung cancer two doctors told me this week they're an interesting case sure am because they're not just my doctors and i appreciate them they've actually given me some help this week but i appreciate them but i got another doctor and he's a high physician and he cares and he's a faithful high priest that can be touched with the feeling of of our infirmities [Applause] paul writes this talking about commitment paul writes the adoption chapter of romans in a prison inspired in a prison and i want you to listen to these words through a different focus as though this is the last service for you and we know all things work together for good to them that love god you mean bad things happen to me it's good for me hallelujah do you know cancer no matter how wicked and terrible it is it's only a tool in the hand of god but it drove me into a higher walk with god so i can tell mr sloughfoot himself it was good for me there's no way the devil can understand that that god used him in my life to bring me closer to him for all things work together for good to them that love god to them or who are they called according to his purpose are you with me now hang on to that his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called now watch how god operates yesterday today and forever god's eternal he sees way back there and he sees way up yonder for them he called him he also called them he also justified as though it never happened to you in the first place your slate is clean [Applause] and god in his infinite mind don't even remember it anymore and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us [Applause] he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall we how shall he not with him freely give us all things he's not holding nothing back from you you're going to get it all you inherit the whole kingdom of god and neither spared not his own son but delivered him up for us how shall he not with him freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died ye rather is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who maketh intercession for us all who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword or cancer or sugar divide us or paralyzed or dementia all of none of that will separate us from the love of god as it is written for thy sake we're killed all the day long and we're accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all of these things we may have had to go through a lot of things in our life but nay and all of these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us hallelujah not in your ability but in his ability i can do all things through christ jesus this is a man writing from a dungeon for i am persuaded hallelujah listen the sword was being sharpened and getting ready he knew where he was headed for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things presence nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord why is it written like that he's not your lord unless you make him your lord he's not your king unless you make him your king he's not your god unless you make him your god first thessalonians chapter 4 written by the same writer for but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you saw not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain under the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the archangel and the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord now notice these next words wherefore comfort one another with these words an american we're a young nation can i get some water as an american we're a young nation so our graves will not hold a thousand thousand your grave we don't have two thousand year graves here in america that we know of i'm sure there's some but most of our graves our cemeteries around here are up to a couple hundred years old names on them and dates of life on them dashes on them but when you go to europe and some of the other countries and you go through the cemetery and i went through columbus in ireland cemetery to where that's where his church was and there's 1400 year old graves this scripture pertains to them as well brother matters you we just married your wife this scripture pertains to her are you with me listen she's going to get up out of that grave or step from that dimension as a young woman but so is the 1400 year old grave [Applause] that's already went back to the ashes in the gashes or maybe even the scripture says that the sea will give up her death the hugest graveyard in the world is the ocean and the word of god is a prophecy it's not an if it's not a forecast like the weather it's going to happen there's going to come a resurrection like there was going to come a messiah are you with me you got just a few more minutes for me to preach to you i want you to come back you you got to come back i believe i could preach to you all day long [Applause] we're friends i want you to know that amen now let's just let's just capture something just for a few minutes that's him that was him in creation that was him because he's identified by his characteristics that's him when he said let there be i wanted today maybe ronald get a trip one day and i'll have a personal day with him and he'll say would you like to see how it was all created oh yeah i'd like to add do i need a space suit no there's three or four stars it's even together now as you can see i think it's four stars that you can actually see in the sky right now and there there are four planets and you can see them in the sky it's just a beautiful scene i've seen pictures of it but i personally haven't seen it yet but but you know he made that now you see when he wrote his first bible he didn't put it on parchment paper so he so he wrote it in the sky and so he began to speak the zodiac into existence that was him so he spoke leo the the lion and the stars that would make it all up and he would place it there so enoch when he was on earth could look up and see it because he wouldn't have this but he would know the author because that's him are you with me he had a purpose in his creation that's him that was him in a cradle that was him laying wrapped in swaddling clothes that was him we believe that that's him in the mystery of his birth it was him that prophesied through the prophets for hundreds of years and then he came and they missed him but that was still him i know i'm elementary now that was him that had gabriel to speak to a little girl we have guesstimates of how old she was but she wasn't an old girl she was probably in her adolescence she was probably in her teenage years but god spoke to her he didn't go to a thousand women to pick a womb he went to one girl because that's him and and she said be it unto me according to your words now i want to get to my title now mary didn't have to do anything but take him at his work so let's just watch this simply watch she goes home and tells joseph she doesn't have to convince joseph an angel comes and visits him she goes to elizabeth and tells her testimony and the baby in her womb which was the preceding prophet for this one would come to life when his name is spoken so she watched resurrection power at his name she knew i i feel like preaching she knew that she had not laid with some roman soldier she knew that joseph had not defiled her she knew that and she knew that that holy visitation had spawned something in her womb and now it was growing and month after month she watched that holy thing are you doing you're watching the word transform your life when you can't hold yourself when you can't hold yourself you would have quit if you could have you would have turned back if you could have but you just stood and watched that supernatural presence of god in the loaf himself in your life it's preparing you for a rapture hallelujah oh brother ron what if i go by the way of the grave just watch just watch i says this last breath breathe out of your life you just watch this is not the end but you you'll go through a change from this body to another body and your last breath here is your first breath there and cancer don't have a hope of you no more it can't hold you no more it can't defeat you no more mortals shall take on immortality and then shall be brought together the change of this body [Applause] watch [Applause] that's him that was him in creation that was him in a manger that was him on the cross that was him on the day of pentecost but that's him here this morning all paul knew was when he met him on the road to damascus he could never be the same man all you know is when you meet him that i can never go back ever again but it's more than just an experience can i give you one more that's not as i was suffering in the night i pulled myself up on a pillow my wife was laying there sleeping i might as well take this off go about to get good and i was laying there suffering and i and i was thinking about some of the places that i've been when i prayed for that little mother that on tuesday morning they were going to take that dead baby and i prayed for her and on tuesday they gave her a living baby when i was standing in the temp meeting and i was getting in the car with you andrew you put me in the car and they said there's a baby here there's a little girl in a wheelchair and i said i want to pray for her and i got back out of the car and went under that tent about 1100 people there i went under that tent and the mother was there she'd driven from florida to be there and i went under that tent that little baby six years old couldn't walk and i took her by the feet i was reminding the devil last night i was there i was there when her feet opened up and she ran all over that building i was there i was there when the man came from the back of the building as i was preaching and he was putting one foot in front of another with his crotches and he was making his way about six inches at a time and as he's making his way and he got up to about the front row and the spirit of god hit him and he just threw his crutches in the air and he walked by dancing i was there i was there in germany when the blind eyes came open when the deaf ears came open when sister karen pruitt got healed i was there i was there when about 800 people came through the prayer line and one miracle after another miracle after another miracle are you with me now i was there in north carolina [Applause] actually what's the prayer line was going and god just took a lady's shoulder and she was up for our operation and they was going to completely rebuild the whole thing in a moment god rebuilt that as i was laying on that pillar last night i reminded the devil i was there now i'm not going to live in my history but i'm here now this sermon is not just for christians i want the devil to hear this watch watch god's not just going to heal me of cancer he's going to turn this back red again i'm not going to need these no more i'm going to get a new body like unto his own glorious body and it's not just for me it's for you [Applause] watch i was i wasn't going to tell you but i'm going to tell you last night i just kept when i fall asleep i dreamed the same dream and it was a demon reporting to his boss and he kept by going back and telling his boss i can't kill him i've tried i can't kill him i can't kill him hallelujah why don't you just go ahead and tell the devil watch watch watch watch just watch stick around here and just watch a little while the
