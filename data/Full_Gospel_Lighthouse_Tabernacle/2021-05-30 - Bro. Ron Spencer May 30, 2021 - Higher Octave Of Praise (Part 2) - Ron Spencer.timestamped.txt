[1:00:30] to me
[1:00:42] [Applause]
[1:00:54] do believe that i am testifying about
[1:00:56] what god has done for wesley
[1:00:58] um he's 15 months old
[1:01:01] and up until this time he hasn't
[1:01:04] walked crawl and hardly even stood on
[1:01:07] his own two feet
[1:01:09] around seven months i started taking him
[1:01:13] to
[1:01:13] uh the chiropractor and he was checked
[1:01:16] out and everything and everything
[1:01:17] was fine he just had some tension in his
[1:01:20] neck
[1:01:21] and something to do with his hips but i
[1:01:23] mean it didn't really cause concern
[1:01:25] um but we took him for about three
[1:01:28] months or so
[1:01:29] and every month that would come and go
[1:01:33] and there was no sign of standing
[1:01:36] crawling anything any desire
[1:01:38] to do that was starting to become really
[1:01:40] alarming to me
[1:01:42] and i cannot tell you
[1:01:46] how many prayers i prayed over this boy
[1:01:51] um i'd go out in the woods to have some
[1:01:55] alone time with the lord and
[1:01:57] i would just really cry out to god
[1:02:00] about him and his birthday comes and
[1:02:04] goes
[1:02:05] and i'm really starting to feel a little
[1:02:07] down in my heart
[1:02:10] and i brother wayne lawson was here and
[1:02:12] i had him
[1:02:13] get prayed over and he started making
[1:02:16] improvements
[1:02:17] and we had this little walker in our
[1:02:20] home called and around we go
[1:02:22] and i would normally put him in this
[1:02:24] around we go and he would just
[1:02:27] sit there i would give him so much tummy
[1:02:30] time
[1:02:31] all these months and he would just lay
[1:02:33] there
[1:02:35] i would listen to random tapes and it
[1:02:38] would
[1:02:38] it would just so happen to be that on
[1:02:40] these random tapes
[1:02:42] um brother brandon would talk about that
[1:02:45] mother that would take her baby to the
[1:02:47] ten cent thrift store
[1:02:49] and she would wave everything in front
[1:02:52] of that baby
[1:02:53] and that baby would just sit there and
[1:02:55] stare and she
[1:02:57] pretty much collapses in the store and
[1:02:58] she's like oh god this baby's not any
[1:03:00] better
[1:03:02] even though you'd wave a toy in front of
[1:03:04] wesley he's going to acknowledge it he's
[1:03:06] going to reach out for it but still
[1:03:08] that desire that lack of desire for not
[1:03:12] wanting to be mobile was
[1:03:14] starting to really weigh heavy on me and
[1:03:16] i would listen to him talk
[1:03:18] talk tell that story and i would be like
[1:03:21] i'm starting to relate to that panic
[1:03:25] and but like i said i prayed so many
[1:03:29] prayers and god
[1:03:30] is my god and
[1:03:33] he heard every single one of them
[1:03:38] and two sundays ago when brother ron
[1:03:41] had that vision of him walking wesley
[1:03:44] down the aisle and he told him
[1:03:45] i'm going to heal that baby i don't
[1:03:48] really know what was wrong with them
[1:03:50] but even that desire that lack of desire
[1:03:54] for not wanting to be mobile he needed
[1:03:56] to be healed from that
[1:03:59] but the last two weeks god has been at
[1:04:02] our house
[1:04:04] he has been going around and around
[1:04:07] in that around we go just as fast as he
[1:04:10] can go
[1:04:12] he's been trying to crawl
[1:04:15] he's been trying to pull himself up on
[1:04:17] our coffee table
[1:04:19] he'll stand on his own two feet and he's
[1:04:22] even trying to take a few steps when
[1:04:24] you're holding on to his hand
[1:04:26] we also have a little bus that he loves
[1:04:29] and
[1:04:30] normally we would have to push him on
[1:04:32] this bus he can also walk behind the bus
[1:04:34] when the time comes
[1:04:36] he loves it and i had him sitting on
[1:04:39] this bus
[1:04:40] just a few days ago and i wasn't even
[1:04:42] thinking about
[1:04:44] anything i didn't even think he knew
[1:04:46] what to do with this bus
[1:04:48] as soon as i put him on that bus he
[1:04:51] starts taking off with his legs
[1:05:06] and i will say that every single time
[1:05:09] wesley
[1:05:10] does something that he's never done
[1:05:12] before i can
[1:05:13] feel the presence of the lord come in
[1:05:15] the room
[1:05:16] that day when he got on that bus he came
[1:05:19] in the living room
[1:05:20] it was very it was a very sweet but
[1:05:23] strong feeling
[1:05:25] and every time something like that
[1:05:27] happens i think of that song i don't
[1:05:29] even know what it's called
[1:05:31] that song how can i keep from shouting
[1:05:33] your name
[1:05:34] how could i ever say enough how amazing
[1:05:38] is your love so
[1:05:41] god is good and he's going to either
[1:05:44] crawl or walk or something but he'll be
[1:05:46] just fine
[1:05:58] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:04] well give god praise
[1:06:08] you just watched a miracle
[1:06:13] you heard a mother's heart but oh
[1:06:16] the heart of the father is so much
[1:06:20] greater
[1:06:22] oh praise the lord brother ron told her
[1:06:24] that when he takes off in church you let
[1:06:26] him run
[1:06:28] and when he runs through here i want
[1:06:29] everybody else running right through
[1:06:31] right behind him
[1:06:35] it's going to happen he said and i
[1:06:38] believe it
[1:06:41] jesus has come by the way more than the
[1:06:44] corridors this morning
[1:06:46] he's come by the way a full gospel
[1:06:48] lighthouse to do business
[1:06:51] he's come to heal your heart he's come
[1:06:52] to minister to you
[1:06:54] i was speaking with ali last weekend
[1:06:57] before we
[1:06:57] come to church on sunday and she's been
[1:07:00] having some real
[1:07:01] allergy issues and her eyes really
[1:07:03] bothering her
[1:07:05] and so i just grabbed her up into my
[1:07:06] arms there before we come to church and
[1:07:08] i told her i said now allie today
[1:07:10] jesus is going to come by when he comes
[1:07:13] by
[1:07:14] i want you to just i just want you to
[1:07:16] talk to him he might sweep by you in a
[1:07:17] breeze he might
[1:07:19] i don't know how he'll do it but when he
[1:07:20] comes by i want you to i want you to
[1:07:22] just talk to him there
[1:07:24] and ask him lord will you will you touch
[1:07:26] my eyes
[1:07:27] she come to me after church she said
[1:07:28] daddy jesus came by my way
[1:07:31] she said i can't hardly cry she said but
[1:07:33] i she said i began to cry right there
[1:07:35] and she said i can't hardly talk to you
[1:07:37] without crying about it
[1:07:39] if a little child could recognize the
[1:07:42] presence of the lord
[1:07:45] what about us today i believe jesus
[1:07:48] is coming by our way and i believe it's
[1:07:50] more than time to just step into the
[1:07:52] water i believe he is
[1:07:54] the water of life and i believe it's
[1:07:56] time to receive him
[1:07:58] receive healing receive salvation
[1:08:02] receive more of the holy ghost it's time
[1:08:05] to praise him like never before
[1:08:08] it's time to adore him and worship him
[1:08:11] it's a time of worship it's a time of
[1:08:13] priests

[1:22:44] we are hungry and we want to be fed
[1:22:48] oh god feed us of the wine of the holy
[1:22:51] ghost
[1:22:51] now minister to our hearts even now in
[1:22:54] jesus christ's name we pray
[1:22:56] a man and a man amen and you may be
[1:22:58] seated let's have church
[1:23:02] look over at your neighbor and say let's
[1:23:03] have church
[1:23:05] he's been fighting you all week long the
[1:23:07] devil has and why don't you just tell
[1:23:09] him
[1:23:10] today time out devil we're going to have
[1:23:12] church here
[1:23:13] [Applause]
[1:23:18] oh hallelujah
[1:23:23] now let's remember just just as a
[1:23:25] reminder who we are
[1:23:28] maybe the first time maybe hearing a
[1:23:30] sermon but maybe we must remember god's
[1:23:32] choosing abroad
[1:23:34] when brother branham came to choosing of
[1:23:36] a bride he preached sermons like god's
[1:23:38] chosen place of worship
[1:23:40] god's very choosing where he likes to go
[1:23:42] to be worshipped at
[1:23:45] then brother branham comes to a point
[1:23:47] there's about 700 people that was there
[1:23:49] that was listening to the sermon in a
[1:23:51] live audience
[1:23:53] of of choosing of a bride and if you
[1:23:56] remember
[1:23:57] the morning he spoke on the shock won't
[1:24:00] be air
[1:24:01] with the wheat now that's what brother
[1:24:03] brahm called it that evening
[1:24:05] and of course they they they named it a
[1:24:07] little bit different when it when it was
[1:24:08] actually put in book form
[1:24:10] but he says he said that shock won't be
[1:24:14] won't be air with the wheat that's a
[1:24:16] real true statement
[1:24:19] that's a real true statement the shock's
[1:24:21] gonna fall away
[1:24:22] and the wheat's going to take a rapture
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:26] now god's made a choice of his wife
[1:24:30] and we have been predetermined to live
[1:24:32] in this age and we're pre-planned and
[1:24:34] we're predestinated
[1:24:36] we will overcome and so god has brought
[1:24:39] us into a special position
[1:24:42] as the bride of jesus christ we
[1:24:45] are reflecting in genesis 24
[1:24:48] of of rebecca saying i will go with the
[1:24:52] man
[1:24:53] brother man said she acted on an impulse
[1:24:57] angel had arranged in the meeting and
[1:25:00] she was the predestinated bride
[1:25:03] eloheeser didn't realize that he was
[1:25:06] going to be a type as a well
[1:25:08] as the elder servant that god would sin
[1:25:11] in this generation listen there's not
[1:25:15] another message coming
[1:25:18] the rapture is imminent at any time
[1:25:23] the bride around the world in every
[1:25:26] nation
[1:25:26] has made herself ready we have been
[1:25:30] given the
[1:25:31] wedding garment we
[1:25:34] type like elegieser we type
[1:25:38] the bride that listened to elohees's
[1:25:41] voice
[1:25:43] now we didn't fall in love with elohees
[1:25:45] or brother branham
[1:25:46] but we fell in love with christ himself
[1:25:49] the word living in this day
[1:25:53] now we must remember that that elohees
[1:25:56] are told
[1:25:57] what isaac was like eleganzer
[1:26:01] told him what he likes and how he acts
[1:26:04] and what his attitude was and
[1:26:06] and and there was a song that was sung
[1:26:09] elijah tell me more
[1:26:12] so in this day you've got tapes that you
[1:26:15] listen to
[1:26:16] listen to like chosen chosen place of
[1:26:18] worship or
[1:26:19] or god identified in his characteristics
[1:26:22] or
[1:26:22] or jezebel religion you want to know how
[1:26:25] to dress to be the bride of jesus christ
[1:26:29] now the denomination they don't want
[1:26:31] that they can't chew that

[1:26:42] gonna preach this morning

[1:29:44] something to praise the lord about
[1:29:47] we are his wife
[1:29:49] [Applause]
[1:29:51] we are not a mannequin
[1:29:55] if you don't know what that word is
[1:29:56] sometimes when you go through some of
[1:29:58] these
[1:29:59] some of these uh department stores
[1:30:02] there'll be a mannequin stand in there
[1:30:04] and i have certain clothes on it and

[1:30:24] of god

[1:30:44] don't be an interesting marriage if you
[1:30:46] had to make your wife do everything or

[1:30:57] i don't do lazy
[1:31:01] i don't do lazy look over at your
[1:31:03] neighbor say i don't do lazy
[1:31:08] now if you're lazy this is probably the
[1:31:10] wrong church

[1:31:16] church well
[1:31:17] brother ron i want you to fix my
[1:31:19] problems i i i want you
[1:31:21] i i would like to have about four hours
[1:31:23] with you to just tell you my life story
[1:31:26] save your breath i don't do life stories
[1:31:30] you do the prayer
[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:36] it brings me to a good spot sometimes we
[1:31:40] expect god to answer prayer
[1:31:42] that we haven't prayed
[1:31:48] sure god can read your mind but that's
[1:31:51] not what he said for you to do
[1:31:53] you pray and believe
[1:31:57] prayer is uttering words across your
[1:32:00] lips
[1:32:01] sometimes quietly sometimes boisterous
[1:32:04] but god hears prayer
[1:32:11] now understand being the bride of jesus
[1:32:13] christ you have power
[1:32:15] to bind and loose sometimes the devil
[1:32:18] runs all over your lives because
[1:32:20] you haven't took the time to find him
[1:32:25] how do i find him take the word of god
[1:32:28] and go to prayer and tell the devils get
[1:32:31] out of my
[1:32:32] life and go back to hell where you came
[1:32:35] [Applause]
[1:32:38] from
[1:32:41] that might not be politically correct or
[1:32:43] even religiously correct
[1:32:46] but that's one spot in your life where
[1:32:48] you can tell somebody to go to hell
[1:32:55] don't take that wrong don't tell your
[1:32:57] boss or your wife you tell the devil
[1:33:13] when you pray believe faith believe it
[1:33:23] so many times we suffer and we neglect
[1:33:28] because of unoffered prayers
[1:33:36] well that's good amen
[1:33:42] let me just say this to you before we go
[1:33:44] into this subject this morning
[1:33:47] you don't have to go to the president of
[1:33:50] the united states of america
[1:33:53] you don't have to go to the to the
[1:33:56] emperor or
[1:33:56] over top of russia or even the pope
[1:34:02] you as a christian can fall on your
[1:34:05] knees
[1:34:07] and cause hell to shake
[1:34:11] when you utter prayer before our
[1:34:14] living god and i want to remind you
[1:34:17] before we go forward

[1:34:22] he is the king of kings and he is the
[1:34:25] lord of lords
[1:34:26] and there's no power more powerful
[1:34:30] than our god

[1:36:44] saw a new heaven and a new earth for the
[1:36:45] first heaven and the first earth were
[1:36:47] passed away
[1:36:48] and there was no more sea and i john saw
[1:36:51] the holy city
[1:36:53] new jerusalem coming down from god out
[1:36:55] of heaven prepared as a bride
[1:36:57] adorned for her husband that's me
[1:37:01] and i heard a great voice out of saying
[1:37:04] behold the tabernacle of god is with men
[1:37:06] and he will dwell with them and they
[1:37:08] shall be his people
[1:37:10] and god himself shall be be with them
[1:37:13] and be their god for god shall wipe away
[1:37:17] all tears from their eyes and there
[1:37:18] shall be no more death
[1:37:20] neither sorrow nor cry neither shall
[1:37:22] there be any more pain
[1:37:23] for the former things are passed away
[1:37:26] that's enough to shout about tonight
[1:37:30] and he that set up on the throne said
[1:37:32] behold i make all things
[1:37:34] new and he said unto me right for these
[1:37:36] words
[1:37:37] are are true and faithful

[1:39:31] and he saith unto me right blessed are
[1:39:33] they which are called to the marriage
[1:39:35] supper

[1:47:01] you got is yourself
[1:47:03] [Applause]
[1:47:06] god's unlimited is you that limited god
[1:47:18] there shall no evil befall thee neither
[1:47:21] shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling
[1:47:23] for he shall give his angels charge over

[1:48:07] stone
[1:48:08] thou shall tread upon the lion and the
[1:48:10] adder the young lion and the dragon
[1:48:11] shalt thou trample and defeat because he
[1:48:13] has set his love upon me
[1:48:15] therefore will i deliver him i will set
[1:48:17] him high uh
[1:48:19] him on high because he has known my name
[1:48:24] he shall call upon me and i will
[1:48:27] answer him i will be with him
[1:48:31] in trouble i will deliver him and honor
[1:48:34] him
[1:48:34] with long life will i satisfy him and
[1:48:37] show him my salvation
[1:48:46] today the scientific theory of the
[1:48:47] modern so-called religionist
[1:48:49] groups have tried to prove that this
[1:48:51] thing that we have called the holy
[1:48:53] spirit
[1:48:54] is only emotion see
[1:48:57] it just don't stand up to according to
[1:48:59] their scientific theory
[1:49:01] well i would like to ask him this
[1:49:05] what makes them change what makes a
[1:49:08] drunkard stop drinking
[1:49:09] what makes a prostitute cease from her
[1:49:12] evil life
[1:49:13] what makes cancer and diseases depart
[1:49:16] from people
[1:49:17] and the deaf and the dumb and the blind
[1:49:19] and the dead to raise up
[1:49:21] explain that is that emotion
[1:49:26] it has a motion with it certainly
[1:49:29] anything that's alive has emotion
[1:49:32] and anything that doesn't have emotion
[1:49:35] is
[1:49:36] dead
[1:49:37] [Music]
[1:49:37] [Applause]
[1:49:41] brother i'm going to send you a text and
[1:49:43] blast you for being emotional
[1:49:44] you're telling me that you're dead
[1:49:48] and anything that's dead needs to be
[1:49:50] buried
[1:49:52] and if you want to be buried go to the
[1:49:55] funeral home and get an
[1:49:56] early you can walk in and get a discount
[1:50:03] you can pick out your casket you can
[1:50:06] pick up the stone that they'll put on it
[1:50:08] you can pick out what it was this just
[1:50:10] saying
[1:50:12] there's a lot of people said in church
[1:50:14] that should go to the funeral home
[1:50:19] because they're dead
[1:50:22] they want the preacher to praise god for
[1:50:24] they want the songlander to praise god
[1:50:27] for them
[1:50:41] they said they crossed their arms and
[1:50:43] said entertain me
[1:50:45] we are not entertainers
[1:50:48] i am not in the entertaining business
[1:50:51] this is where we come and worship god
[1:50:56] if you don't feel comfortable here leave
[1:51:01] all right we need your pew
[1:51:22] but i think we ought to bury some of
[1:51:23] these emotionless religions
[1:51:27] for those on by the way of the internet
[1:51:28] that now criticizing me
[1:51:31] that is brother branham's words in black
[1:51:34] with yellow marking on it
[1:51:38] you'll profit that you believe
[1:51:44] and i want to remind you that i have
[1:51:46] been around for quite a long time
[1:51:48] i got gray hair in my head and i stood
[1:51:51] at his casket as a little boy
[1:51:54] and i remember when brother branham they
[1:51:56] would tell a brother random when he
[1:51:58] would get done preaching
[1:51:59] he'd start swinging his coat over top of
[1:52:01] his head going walking the altar
[1:52:04] [Applause]
[1:52:07] brother branham was not a dead preacher
[1:52:10] he was quite emotional the devil's
[1:52:14] passing out so let me give him a little
[1:52:15] bit
[1:52:16] more there was a time that brother
[1:52:17] branham got to preaching so hard he
[1:52:19] jumped up on the plaque on the pulpit
[1:52:21] and got the shake in his legs and then
[1:52:24] he got down into the pulpit
[1:52:25] and he started pulling his pants up
[1:52:31] come on
[1:52:54] he didn't just limit it to church i hear
[1:52:56] him talking about up on a hunting trip
[1:52:59] then he got to shouting and he got to
[1:53:02] shouting around the tree
[1:53:09] i ain't no schoolboy when it comes to
[1:53:11] this message
[1:53:13] i've been eating it since i was a little
[1:53:14] boy
[1:53:16] i've been digesting it and i have always
[1:53:18] believed that this message
[1:53:20] will one day live in a church and i've
[1:53:23] lived long enough to see it happen
[1:53:26] you're full of this movement life of his
[1:53:29] life
[1:53:30] all of his power spirit of his spirit
[1:53:34] your christ in the pride of jesus christ
[1:53:40] why shouldn't we get inside why should
[1:53:43] we praise him
[1:53:58] the other day when i saw those jews
[1:54:00] being bombed
[1:54:06] yet there were thousands of them
[1:54:08] standing at the wailing wall
[1:54:10] worshiping and if you were able to get
[1:54:13] the video i don't have it available to
[1:54:14] send to you
[1:54:15] but they were standing there dancing
[1:54:18] while bombs were dropping
[1:54:25] if god's formed who can be against them
[1:54:30] [Applause]

[1:55:03] feelings but i want you to know

[1:55:27] everywhere
[1:55:28] he's not omnipotent like god

[2:00:18] and then i'm just gonna whip you brother
[2:00:20] lyle and i as
[2:00:21] as we were set out there he said that
[2:00:23] that's sister moore's father
[2:00:26] and how he told me that in the early
[2:00:27] days back in those days when they were
[2:00:29] persecuted and turned out from
[2:00:31] everywhere that
[2:00:32] that he was in a meeting wants to to
[2:00:35] where that they were
[2:00:37] that had forbid them to worship the lord
[2:00:40] in the spirit the devil's been around in
[2:00:42] a long time
[2:00:45] he knows that if real children of god
[2:00:47] start worshiping
[2:00:48] he got trouble
[2:00:53] he got trouble and he said
[2:00:57] and a group of people come up there and
[2:00:59] shop through the windows with pistols
[2:01:01] and rifles
[2:01:02] and an old sister standing in the floor
[2:01:05] with hands
[2:01:06] up in the air praising god while the
[2:01:08] windows
[2:01:09] were being riddled with bullets from
[2:01:11] rifles and the bullets struck the
[2:01:14] woman's dress and fell
[2:01:15] to the floor without harming her
[2:01:22] we need to go back to a power of god and
[2:01:25] something
[2:01:25] that can do the same thing today
[2:01:30] although in our numbers persecution
[2:01:32] always gives strength to the church
[2:01:33] we've had it so easy
[2:01:35] we get slothful we get to the place
[2:01:37] where we don't want to move on because
[2:01:39] everything's just handed to us
[2:01:41] it takes sorrow tears sweat prayer faith
[2:01:44] then a promise to move forward in the
[2:01:46] power of the holy ghost
[2:01:48] that zeal and power that they had in
[2:01:51] those days as long as time
[2:01:53] vanished from our attend our our
[2:01:55] assemblies
[2:01:56] i'm afraid if the winners would get shot
[2:01:59] out tonight people would run
[2:02:00] every way and never come back
[2:02:13] hallelujah i haven't even got to the
[2:02:15] good part yet
[2:02:17] a true picture of the modern church
[2:02:18] today
[2:02:20] neither does the modern church want any
[2:02:22] of these you're screaming shouting
[2:02:23] tongues speaking
[2:02:24] acts 238 youngins around her
[2:02:29] she don't want any of them whooping and
[2:02:31] crying and screaming
[2:02:33] why such a child would immediately be
[2:02:35] put out of her denomination
[2:02:38] if they had one like that in their
[2:02:39] churches they'd throw her out real quick
[2:02:41] why are you letting such a stuff as that
[2:02:43] go on you see
[2:02:44] she's pregnant with something cause
[2:02:47] she's going to bring
[2:02:48] fourth members all the time but she
[2:02:50] don't want any of them none of them
[2:02:51] scream and hollering blabbering
[2:02:53] acts 2 38 miserable creatures that she
[2:02:56] thinks that they are
[2:02:57] it would certainly embarrass her it
[2:03:00] would ruin her
[2:03:01] her and her educated
[2:03:05] ethical scientific society church
[2:03:08] that she belonged to here they would
[2:03:10] throw her out at the next council
[2:03:12] she can't have it so she don't want to
[2:03:15] be pregnant
[2:03:16] with the word because that's the only
[2:03:19] kind
[2:03:20] that the word can bring forth
[2:03:22] [Applause]
[2:03:26] born of the spirit of god that's the
[2:03:29] spirit of god in it
[2:03:30] no intellectual church joining creed joy
[2:03:33] going black hair painted face there's no
[2:03:36] such a thing as that in it
[2:03:37] you don't find that in the word of god
[2:03:39] you find old-fashioned
[2:03:41] sanctified holy ghost-filled child born
[2:03:44] of the spirit of god screaming
[2:03:46] hollering shouting praising god
[2:04:06] seems like the older i get the rowdier i
[2:04:08] get
[2:04:16] now you waste your time praying for me
[2:04:18] to die because the next one's routier
[2:04:20] than i am
[2:04:34] god's already voted you ain't gonna have
[2:04:35] to vote
