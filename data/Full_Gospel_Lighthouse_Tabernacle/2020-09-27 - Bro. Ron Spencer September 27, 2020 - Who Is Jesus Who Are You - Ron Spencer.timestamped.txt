[45:53] a bless you can be seated for a moment
[45:56] so good to have our friends with us this
[45:58] day thank you for coming amen
[46:01] amen we while these are different times
[46:07] you know i was thinking this morning as
[46:09] we were preparing to come
[46:10] to service and we we greet you all in
[46:14] the name of the lord but i
[46:16] i was thinking about the conditions that
[46:18] were under now
[46:20] it seemed like when it was in china it
[46:23] was a long way away
[46:25] and seeing the video of how the doctors
[46:28] were handling it there and
[46:31] the dreaded disease and then it swept in
[46:33] europe and
[46:34] it was happening there and you know it
[46:37] seemed like such a long way away
[46:40] but now our churches are sitting
[46:42] basically empty
[46:43] and we have skeleton crews and we've
[46:46] been doing this now for seem like
[46:47] often on months and uh
[46:51] now it's here and you deal with it
[46:54] and and you just know then it strikes
[46:57] one family after another family and
[47:00] and you know we're not exempt from
[47:01] having problems or
[47:03] sicknesses or even as congregations
[47:06] uh we're not the only body of believers
[47:09] that is having
[47:10] this every church
[47:14] whether denominational whatever they are
[47:18] they're facing the same issues
[47:21] governments are facing it uh
[47:24] sports world is facing it coliseum's set
[47:27] empty because of something they can't
[47:30] see
[47:32] as a church world we look at it and
[47:34] sometimes we look at things just a
[47:36] little bit
[47:36] differently and we're not careful
[47:38] there's a fear that comes with it
[47:40] we realize that this is a a horrible
[47:44] horrible disease that has struck us and
[47:47] there's no vaccine
[47:48] for it and i just i just came through it
[47:52] myself and sister connie just came
[47:54] through it
[47:55] um two weeks of double pneumonia and my
[47:58] both lungs and
[48:00] and i went to the hospital they treated
[48:02] me like royalty there
[48:04] and i appreciated that sister uh
[48:07] crystal was there at the same time and
[48:10] she had been sitting there for about
[48:12] three or three hours and and uh
[48:15] kind of waiting her turn and i came in
[48:18] and sat down beside
[48:19] of her and you would have thought jesus
[48:22] sat down beside of her and so
[48:24] she was just seemed lonely seemed a
[48:26] little bit anxious about it all and
[48:28] and i sat down with her for a moment and
[48:31] they called her and within two minutes
[48:34] they call me
[48:35] and of course of course i i go dress
[48:39] like i'm a preacher and so they they
[48:41] came and got me real quickly and took me
[48:43] back in the room
[48:45] and they said you just can't be sitting
[48:47] out there with all those other people
[48:50] with your condition and so and i said
[48:52] well you guys treat me like royalty and
[48:54] they said you
[48:55] are and so i was appreciative to that
[48:58] i thank you for your prayers through
[49:00] that season of time there was a few
[49:01] nights that
[49:03] i didn't think i was going to make it i
[49:05] still am
[49:06] i'm on the monitoring system for uva and
[49:09] so
[49:10] they call me about every day and i
[49:12] appreciate that
[49:14] we'll continue to pray for sister
[49:16] katie's family
[49:18] and also brother larry medes's family
[49:21] that god would be with them in a special
[49:23] way
[49:24] that god would touch them and larry was
[49:26] a friend of
[49:27] this church sister katie had been here
[49:30] for a couple years and
[49:32] she was in her late 80s and and this
[49:35] morning i was looking at some of her
[49:37] younger pictures and
[49:39] and i'm pretty sure i remember her as a
[49:42] younger woman
[49:43] and we want to we want to just pray for
[49:45] that family we want to give them all the
[49:47] strength that we can today
[49:50] also brother larry will be deeply missed
[49:54] but what a better place to be in the
[49:55] arms of jesus
[49:58] and we just we look at that and we just
[50:00] see that god just watched over
[50:02] him through his life and protected him
[50:05] he worked we worked with brother
[50:07] out in here in in in in many
[50:10] many for many years and and uh good guy
[50:14] good guy we hunted many of us hunted
[50:16] with him
[50:17] he was a great provider for the meadows
[50:19] home he'd be deeply missed
[50:22] but i believe that there's a land beyond
[50:24] the river a
[50:26] great god of mercy that takes care of
[50:28] things and
[50:29] and we just thank the lord for that amen
[50:32] just as a report for you i had two
[50:34] cancer appointments actually many more
[50:36] than that but
[50:37] cancer appointments this week and and
[50:40] sometimes they just scratch their heads
[50:41] and say wow we don't even know
[50:44] and so and so i i just we just chuckled
[50:48] sister connie and i just kind of
[50:49] chuckled
[50:50] just before i was going into the
[50:52] appointment we saw
[50:54] on facebook if somebody already had the
[50:56] results of my appointments
[50:58] before i even walked in and so i
[51:02] let me let me just give you the straight
[51:04] of it i i take treatments every day and
[51:08] that is uh basically uh
[51:11] immunotherapy treatments i take eight
[51:13] pills a day
[51:14] and cancers in my lungs and in my brains
[51:17] and in my lymph nodes
[51:19] and they're fighting them and they
[51:21] they're changing they're doing some
[51:22] different transformations of the cancer
[51:25] it's kind of moving a bit we're
[51:27] believing they're leaving our body
[51:30] i don't know i asked the other day i
[51:33] asked one of the doctors the other day
[51:34] and i said
[51:35] well when will i not be stage four and
[51:38] she said
[51:38] you'll be stage four until the day that
[51:41] you go home
[51:42] and so and so my other doctor
[51:46] says it like this whose report do you
[51:49] believe
[51:51] and so we believe that report and we
[51:54] just trusted him
[51:55] i i appreciate your prayers i i did get
[51:59] some
[51:59] i did get an awesome news yesterday that
[52:02] my eyes are

[52:35] yesterday we i
[52:36] had i was very very sick and and i
[52:39] didn't know if i'd be able to make it
[52:40] here this morning but
[52:41] god by his grace rich in mercy he he
[52:44] brought that to us and i don't have
[52:46] anything that
[52:46] i'll be honest with you i don't have
[52:48] anything that's contagious today but
[52:51] unless you're taking same medicine i am
[52:53] so but i was uh
[52:54] yeah sometimes you take medicine and and
[52:57] it reacts one way someday you take it
[52:59] another day and it

[53:01] and it and it does you okay and then all
[53:04] of a sudden you have a really bad day
[53:05] but
[53:06] you know you just the good days outweigh
[53:08] the bad days and so
[53:10] i'm thankful to be able to stand here
[53:12] and to to all the audiences
[53:14] to whomever i'm speaking to this morning

[53:32] and even worse we just pray for you
[53:34] sister erica
[53:36] sister susan and just to roll off some
[53:38] names real quick brother aaron
[53:40] we love him with all of our hearts and
[53:42] and we just pray that god would just
[53:44] raise him back up in a special way sorry
[53:47] for a few moments of there but i
[53:49] but i want to share a few things on my
[53:50] heart this morning maybe you could stand
[53:52] just
[53:53] where you're at and amen
[53:59] god bless you first john chapter 1 and
[54:02] verse 1.
[54:04] and i want to just take a thought this
[54:06] morning and i won't get done because of
[54:08] of the times constraints but and even my
[54:12] own energy but i want to speak to you
[54:16] who is jesus and i want to ask a
[54:19] question
[54:20] who are you and i really want to ask
[54:24] that question
[54:25] who are you and i want you to answer
[54:29] that question in your mind now
[54:32] because i was asked the other day who is
[54:35] ron spencer
[54:38] and then it was asked who is ron spencer
[54:44] and then it was asked to me again who is
[54:47] ron spencer
[54:48] so i think it's a good a good thought
[54:50] this morning i'd like for you to
[54:52] you to answer this in your mind who are
[54:55] you
[54:58] who are you really
[55:02] who are you not because somebody else
[55:05] says it
[55:06] but who are you really who are you
[55:09] really
[55:11] who are you really not what the internet
[55:14] says about you
[55:16] but really who are you in another realm
[55:21] they know who you are
[55:25] and i want to say this in another realm
[55:27] that has no
[55:28] time orientation to it they know who you
[55:32] are
[55:34] and you're only stepped out of that
[55:35] little
[55:37] hickey by the time you use that little
[55:39] little hickey of time
[55:41] he said you stepped out of eternity into
[55:43] time and he said you'll step back into
[55:45] eternity
[55:47] amen
[55:51] first john 1 1. that which was from the
[55:55] beginning
[55:56] which we have heard
[56:00] which we have seen with our eyes
[56:05] which we have looked upon and our hands
[56:08] have handled
[56:09] of the word of life
[56:13] for the life was manifested and we seen
[56:16] it
[56:16] and bear witness and show unto you
[56:20] that eternal life which
[56:23] was with the father was manifested unto
[56:26] us
[56:27] that which we have seen and declare we
[56:31] unto you that ye also may have
[56:34] fellowship with
[56:35] us and truly our fellowship is with the
[56:39] father
[56:40] and with his son jesus christ
[56:43] and these things right we unto you that
[56:46] your joy may be full
[56:48] this then is the message we have heard
[56:51] of him
[56:52] and declare unto you that god is light
[56:57] and in him is no darkness at all
[57:01] if we say that we have fellowship with
[57:04] him and walk in darkness
[57:06] we lie and do not the truth
[57:10] if we say that we believe the word and
[57:12] we live a different way
[57:14] we're literally living in a lie
[57:19] but if we walk in the light
[57:22] as he is as the light we have fellowship
[57:26] one with another and the blood of jesus
[57:30] christ his
[57:31] son cleanseth us
[57:34] from all sin you may be seated this
[57:38] morning
[57:48] the best way i would think this morning
[57:50] to
[57:51] to begin to think of this as brother
[57:54] branham would stand in prayer lines with
[57:56] people
[57:59] and people would come and maybe come for
[58:03] many many hours we mentioned the other
[58:05] day 17
[58:06] hours and they would get a prayer card
[58:09] brother billy paul was one of the ones
[58:11] that would give prayer cards
[58:13] and people would wait in long lines to
[58:15] get a prayer card
[58:17] they would put their name down and their
[58:18] condition down
[58:20] and and they they put it down and and
[58:24] they'd hold that prayer card
[58:25] and it would have a number or a letter
[58:28] on it
[58:29] and they might sit in those meetings and
[58:31] actually get there
[58:32] for many hours and and they would get
[58:35] the card
[58:36] and then finally they would get called
[58:39] and so they'd hold their card
[58:41] and of course there wasn't no duplicates
[58:43] of those cards or anything like that
[58:45] nothing
[58:46] nothing would go on and and so they
[58:49] would
[58:50] they would get their name called or they
[58:52] would get their
[58:53] their number called for the card and
[58:56] they would come
[58:56] line up you would hear brother branham
[58:58] sometimes spend 20 minutes
[59:00] getting the prayer line lined up and he
[59:03] would just kind of start
[59:04] he would ask he wouldn't even know where
[59:07] they
[59:07] what numbers were there or what letters
[59:09] were there and he would just kind of
[59:11] impromptu ask what number
[59:13] and maybe if your number got called and
[59:16] you'd have and you would come
[59:18] and you'd saw the miracles before or
[59:20] heard all the miracles and now you've
[59:22] came all of this distance
[59:23] and now you're standing before the
[59:25] prophet of the lord
[59:27] now maybe you've been prayed for by many
[59:30] other people and that's all right
[59:32] but now you're standing with cancer and
[59:36] you know this cancer is going to eat
[59:37] your body up and
[59:39] and it's going to and and it's just it's
[59:41] doing a process
[59:42] because it's got a process to do but
[59:45] you've came before
[59:46] someone that is said to have an angel of
[59:49] the lord with them and
[59:51] the pillar of fire has been sinning the
[59:53] meetings and
[59:54] and there's a there's a presence about
[59:56] this building all of a sudden
[59:58] maybe before there was a a different
[1:00:01] kind of an
[1:00:02] uh meeting that now but something about
[1:00:06] a branham meeting was different because
[1:00:09] of the
[1:00:09] atmosphere was so different in the
[1:00:12] building
[1:00:13] people said that even which would not be
[1:00:15] able to get in that said that you could
[1:00:17] stand
[1:00:18] hundreds of feet away from the building
[1:00:21] and it was like a wave after a wave
[1:00:24] after a wave that would go and you'd
[1:00:27] stand and
[1:00:28] one brother told me he said me and my my
[1:00:31] wife we would stand in our hands held
[1:00:34] and
[1:00:34] and he said we would stand and it would
[1:00:37] hit us wave after
[1:00:38] wave and he said we were kids and we
[1:00:41] didn't get the
[1:00:41] opportunity to be in the meetings but we
[1:00:44] just stood there
[1:00:45] and it would just wave after wave of the
[1:00:48] glory of god
[1:00:49] and he said i'll tell you brother ron it
[1:00:51] changed my life
[1:00:54] there's still real dedicated christians
[1:00:57] today
[1:00:58] and i'd say that holds true
[1:01:04] and so maybe maybe if i could just put
[1:01:08] myself there
[1:01:10] and stand just for a moment just on the
[1:01:12] platform and
[1:01:14] brother branham starts calling my name
[1:01:18] he begins to talk to me about my father
[1:01:21] my mother
[1:01:23] and just kind of go with me here just
[1:01:24] for a few minutes and he begins to talk
[1:01:27] to me about my name
[1:01:29] maybe even tells me where i live
[1:01:33] and i've never met you before
[1:01:37] that would be true and i
[1:01:41] i see you're a preacher yes and i
[1:01:44] i your name is ronald dean your mother
[1:01:46] called you that
[1:01:47] yes that's right and they found cancer
[1:01:51] in your
[1:01:52] lungs and in your lymph nodes in your
[1:01:54] brain
[1:01:56] yes that's that's very true
[1:01:59] i see darkness and it's leaving your
[1:02:01] body
[1:02:05] understand what i just did
[1:02:10] it's leaving your body because that's
[1:02:12] what's happening
[1:02:16] you see that darkness has had a grip on
[1:02:18] this body
[1:02:19] for about a year
[1:02:24] but it'll leave this body
[1:02:27] it'll leave this body because light
[1:02:31] darkness can't dwell where light's at
[1:02:35] there's so much light that is in this
[1:02:38] body that
[1:02:38] darkness the cells of cancer
[1:02:42] and the amusements of even doctors just
[1:02:45] going i don't know
[1:02:46] i just don't know they call me a very
[1:02:49] complicated case i just don't know
[1:02:52] i'll tell you why there's another
[1:02:54] physician that's on the land
[1:02:55] [Applause]
[1:02:57] there's another doctor that's at work
[1:03:01] hallelujah and he told me if that i
[1:03:03] would trust him
[1:03:05] he'd use me like never before
[1:03:09] and my determination has always been to
[1:03:11] trust him
[1:03:13] no matter how sick no matter how dark
[1:03:17] no matter what the avenue looks like no
[1:03:20] matter what this
[1:03:21] is said to me i have
[1:03:24] trusted him
[1:03:28] now mr spencer go home and be well
[1:03:32] in the name of jesus christ
[1:03:34] [Applause]
[1:03:40] you say brother ron that was a little
[1:03:42] silly i you took yourself and put you in
[1:03:44] a
[1:03:45] brother branham's meeting okay
[1:03:48] okay let me be silly one more time
[1:03:53] there was a woman that didn't know who
[1:03:56] she was
[1:03:58] really didn't know
[1:04:01] because so many people say well i know
[1:04:03] jesus and they don't know him
[1:04:07] then they'll go well i know that pastor
[1:04:10] in the area
[1:04:11] they really don't know him
[1:04:14] you don't know him
[1:04:18] like jesus does
[1:04:22] and this woman was named sarah
[1:04:25] and she was sitting in a tent she'd had
[1:04:26] an upset day
[1:04:28] and abraham always had a lot of visitors
[1:04:31] because he's the richest man in the area
[1:04:35] and he had great advice and he was
[1:04:37] fellowshipping with another realm and
[1:04:39] nobody could explain it he would talk
[1:04:42] about it
[1:04:43] and people were associated with it and
[1:04:46] they loved abram
[1:04:48] but they really they couldn't explain
[1:04:50] what was going on
[1:04:52] he got rich but yet you couldn't explain
[1:04:56] it
[1:04:57] because he was almost a nomad he was
[1:05:00] he was blessed everything that he did
[1:05:02] was blessed
[1:05:04] anybody kept testifying i'm going to
[1:05:06] have a son
[1:05:07] out of these loins it's going to come
[1:05:09] nations
[1:05:11] you know there are things that we can't
[1:05:13] explain but we just know
[1:05:16] and god had made it known to him that he
[1:05:18] was going to be the father
[1:05:20] of nations and and you know sometimes
[1:05:24] when you tell people
[1:05:25] i'm going in a rapture and we're a part
[1:05:28] of a bride
[1:05:29] there's things that you just can't
[1:05:31] explain
[1:05:32] well i want to know everything that
[1:05:34] there is about the message and i want to
[1:05:36] know everything that there is about the
[1:05:38] bible
[1:05:40] you know just believe it just come to
[1:05:43] fall in love with
[1:05:44] jesus like never before you can't sit
[1:05:48] down and
[1:05:49] get a theological degree of the serpent
[1:05:52] seed or the godhead or
[1:05:54] the seals or the trumpets or any of
[1:05:57] those
[1:05:58] things or how god makes himself known
[1:06:01] but if you fall in love with jesus
[1:06:05] it'll transform your life like never
[1:06:08] before
[1:06:10] if your children come into the
[1:06:12] atmosphere
[1:06:13] of jesus christ you won't have to make
[1:06:16] them serve the lord
[1:06:18] you won't have to be so worried about it
[1:06:21] you look at my family that is
[1:06:23] surrounding me today
[1:06:24] i've never made them serve god i've
[1:06:27] never been a legalistic
[1:06:29] man around them but i've always had an
[1:06:32] atmosphere
[1:06:33] fall in love with jesus
[1:06:37] are you with me now my children are
[1:06:39] having children and
[1:06:40] i'm so proud of them but that same jesus
[1:06:43] that lived in my home
[1:06:45] can live in your home not just my family
[1:06:49] but the families of this
[1:06:50] church the families around the world
[1:06:56] it's an atmosphere
[1:07:00] sarah was sitting there because she
[1:07:02] hadn't realized
[1:07:04] that she was a part of a promise you see
[1:07:07] when god was
[1:07:08] changing abraham's name he was changing
[1:07:11] hers
[1:07:12] because she was part of him when god was
[1:07:15] saying i'm going to have a covenant with
[1:07:17] you abraham
[1:07:19] he was also having a covenant with sarah
[1:07:24] she wasn't there but she was there
[1:07:28] when god stepped into a body and came to
[1:07:31] abraham's tent
[1:07:33] and he sat there with them unseemably of
[1:07:36] just
[1:07:36] another normal day sarah
[1:07:40] really didn't know who abram was
[1:07:44] i hope you catch that you know you can
[1:07:47] be married to somebody for years
[1:07:50] and really not know who they are
[1:07:56] don't tell me divorce court set full of
[1:07:59] it
[1:08:04] are you with me
[1:08:08] did sister branham really know who
[1:08:11] brother branham was
[1:08:16] did his children really know who their
[1:08:19] father was
[1:08:26] did sister connie that stood at a church
[1:08:29] much like this
[1:08:30] a few years ago did she really know
[1:08:34] who ron spencer was
[1:08:40] i'd say not she knew the ron spencer
[1:08:43] that was in that spot
[1:08:46] young silly boy and then we would go to
[1:08:50] work and we would begin to evolve
[1:08:52] and we would begin to go into life and
[1:08:55] we'd work double jobs
[1:08:57] we'd build the companies together and
[1:09:01] and we we'd have good times bad times
[1:09:04] through that
[1:09:05] and then god would just begin to move us
[1:09:07] to a higher order
[1:09:09] you've been faithful in a few things
[1:09:11] i'll make you faithful
[1:09:13] and then we begin to preach here and all
[1:09:16] over the world
[1:09:19] you know i never had to because i'm
[1:09:22] nothing
[1:09:25] only only to let people know more about
[1:09:28] jesus that's all my whole care was about
[1:09:32] was to get jesus to everyone
[1:09:36] let me just say this to you if i could
[1:09:38] have stepped behind of a
[1:09:39] clow a picture or a behind of a curtain
[1:09:42] and not operated i would have did it
[1:09:44] but you see god had to use the man
[1:09:47] because that's what he does
[1:09:49] and i could call i could call great men
[1:09:54] from tim pruitt brother bischo
[1:09:57] brother donnie all of the ministers
[1:09:59] around the world and
[1:10:01] brother nestor i could call i could call
[1:10:04] from every country
[1:10:05] almost represented great men
[1:10:09] literally great men so the world really
[1:10:13] don't know who they are
[1:10:16] the real the world don't know who they
[1:10:18] are but i want to say this to you
[1:10:20] sometimes you don't realize who you are
[1:10:24] and that's the real key if you could
[1:10:27] only
[1:10:28] treat yourself as how god looks at you
[1:10:33] it would be completely different
[1:10:37] you would you're not with some
[1:10:41] makeshift sacredness or
[1:10:45] some some phony humility
[1:10:49] but with a real with a real sincerity
[1:10:52] and dedication to serve god
[1:11:00] sarah sitting inside of a tent she
[1:11:03] didn't realize who she was
[1:11:06] and she really didn't realize who the
[1:11:07] man now sitting outside was
[1:11:10] really didn't realize that
[1:11:16] you say she did she's married to him she
[1:11:18] was a half
[1:11:19] half sister to it she really didn't
[1:11:22] realize who he was
[1:11:27] because she laughed at what he was
[1:11:30] telling her
[1:11:35] she's getting she's getting she's
[1:11:37] getting aging now
[1:11:42] she wanted she didn't want none of those
[1:11:44] things that would produce agile
[1:11:48] she couldn't believe the vision for
[1:11:49] herself
[1:11:52] so therefore she didn't realize who she
[1:11:53] was
[1:11:56] abraham was testifying but she wasn't
[1:12:03] and so abraham
[1:12:09] meets this man and calls him lord
[1:12:12] sarah doesn't come out and greet him the
[1:12:15] way
[1:12:17] two angels with him and they discuss
[1:12:20] business
[1:12:21] the business of a world falling apart
[1:12:28] we could have some of those discussions
[1:12:30] today
[1:12:32] america's fallen apart in a lot of ways
[1:12:38] don't get don't get too tore up about
[1:12:40] that
[1:12:41] it's supposed to happen oh i want to fix
[1:12:45] politics and i'm a democrat or i'm a
[1:12:47] republican
[1:12:48] don't matter they're all rotten
[1:12:52] well brother ron i'm i'm going to do
[1:12:54] this and i'm going to do that
[1:12:55] and and it's going to be this way and
[1:12:58] i'm going to turn the world upside down
[1:13:00] with prayer
[1:13:02] it's going to fall apart there's a
[1:13:05] prophet stood here not long ago
[1:13:08] in what you call eternal time just only
[1:13:10] seconds ago
[1:13:12] that said america is doomed
[1:13:15] america is going to fall apart so you're
[1:13:18] not going to hear from this pulpit
[1:13:19] there's going to be another revival in
[1:13:21] america
[1:13:22] we heard a prophet and you see
[1:13:25] abraham was sitting there and they
[1:13:28] talked about sodom
[1:13:30] and gomorrah and abraham
[1:13:33] actually negotiated if there could be
[1:13:36] 50 there could that city be saved
[1:13:40] think about that of all of the vast
[1:13:43] humanity that was there
[1:13:45] there's a man on a hill near a tent
[1:13:49] and his wife is going to get a
[1:13:51] revelation and they're negotiating
[1:13:53] about two cities
[1:13:57] that is full of people full of sin but
[1:14:00] these people have lived
[1:14:03] as though that's not even going on
[1:14:06] and now today they're negotiating where
[1:14:09] the fire
[1:14:10] will fall and destroy those two cities
[1:14:14] don't forget how powerful that you are
[1:14:18] because the same man that said at the
[1:14:20] tempt
[1:14:22] has brought a message to you
[1:14:26] are you are you with me and many times
[1:14:29] night after night you would hear
[1:14:32] identified christ of all ages
[1:14:34] shalom are you with me
[1:14:38] this same christ is among you even now
[1:14:41] now you hear it in your pastors and you
[1:14:43] hear it in the evangelists
[1:14:45] standing in your local pulpits that
[1:14:48] saying god
[1:14:49] that was sitting at the tent is with us
[1:14:52] even now
[1:14:54] covid there's been a lot worse things
[1:14:57] than covet
[1:14:59] there's been a lot worse plagues than
[1:15:01] covet
[1:15:02] this is a tribulation period brother on
[1:15:04] we've got
[1:15:05] close to it but this is not the
[1:15:07] tribulation period
[1:15:09] this is only signs that's coming but the
[1:15:12] same melchizedek
[1:15:14] the same jesus is among us now
[1:15:18] to tell us who we are
[1:15:28] the visit would call out her name
[1:15:33] and he would speak to her where's sarah
[1:15:37] he knew where she was or sarah
[1:15:42] why she's in the tent door behind you
[1:15:45] why did she laugh why did she laugh
[1:15:50] i didn't laugh i didn't laugh she said
[1:15:54] brother brown said god could have killed
[1:15:56] her but she was part of the promise
[1:16:01] sometimes our attitude has been and
[1:16:04] don't don't get angelic
[1:16:06] sometimes our attitude has been wrong
[1:16:10] even in times like this sometimes our
[1:16:13] faith gets shaken
[1:16:16] will we ever go back to church again
[1:16:18] will we ever have services
[1:16:20] again will we ever ever listen this
[1:16:23] message will hold
[1:16:25] no matter what storm the message will
[1:16:28] hold
[1:16:31] reading an article the other day will
[1:16:33] our government hold through covet
[1:16:35] will the national football league hold
[1:16:38] through covenant
[1:16:39] will restaurants haul through covenant
[1:16:41] through to covet
[1:16:43] and i thought to myself i'll tell you
[1:16:45] something that'll hold
[1:16:48] i'll tell you something a little this
[1:16:50] message
[1:16:51] will hold true
[1:16:55] are you with me
[1:17:00] now i could talk for a while
[1:17:04] on their visit but whether you know it
[1:17:08] you've been sitting in that same
[1:17:09] atmosphere
[1:17:11] for some of you decades
[1:17:14] and it has been it's been more than just
[1:17:17] evolving you
[1:17:19] that's that's a nice word but it's been
[1:17:21] transforming you
[1:17:24] and preparing you for rapture
[1:17:30] about a week about a week ago
[1:17:35] i see visions other men see dreams
[1:17:40] and how that i know that they are our
[1:17:42] atmosphere
[1:17:43] the atmosphere or the voice in a vision
[1:17:47] and i know it's god
[1:17:51] i just feel to share this with you and
[1:17:53] it's appropriate time because we're
[1:17:54] empty as we are
[1:17:57] and i actually wrestle with should i
[1:17:59] share it should i not share it
[1:18:01] should i share it should i not share it
[1:18:04] and i
[1:18:05] i talked to a very close friend of mine
[1:18:08] here
[1:18:09] and then then i shared it with brother
[1:18:11] tim pruitt
[1:18:13] and he felt i should share it as well
[1:18:17] and i was up early in the morning
[1:18:24] and i found myself going through
[1:18:27] buildings
[1:18:30] i i don't know i don't know let me just
[1:18:32] start it like this how many's ever went
[1:18:33] through the biltmore
[1:18:35] and not just hands here but hands all
[1:18:37] over but the biltmore is the largest
[1:18:41] uh privately held uh residence
[1:18:44] in america it's a monstrous house it was
[1:18:47] a man that incorporated and
[1:18:50] it was part of the vanderbilt family and
[1:18:53] they just had unlimited money and
[1:18:55] and uh until it ran out and they
[1:18:58] actually employed
[1:19:00] more people than anybody else in north
[1:19:02] carolina
[1:19:03] and that in north carolina through those
[1:19:06] years of building
[1:19:07] actually built a railroad just to get
[1:19:10] the materials
[1:19:11] to to this house
[1:19:14] and one of the as you walk as you go
[1:19:17] through the building it's just
[1:19:19] it's beyond your imagination of what a
[1:19:22] building a
[1:19:22] house would be like for those days and
[1:19:26] and you walk through and you just kind
[1:19:28] of grasp the glory
[1:19:30] of what it must have been like to live
[1:19:33] in that house or
[1:19:34] even work in that house just to work in
[1:19:37] that house was quite a wonderful thing
[1:19:39] or
[1:19:39] or to be a gardener or to be a farmer on
[1:19:42] the property that's probably where i
[1:19:44] would have liked to been
[1:19:45] to being a farmer on the property and
[1:19:48] you know he would tour the property the
[1:19:51] owner would tour it or he would be
[1:19:53] overseas and
[1:19:54] and to give you an idea he was a world
[1:19:56] traveler
[1:19:57] and he was scheduled to be on the
[1:19:59] titanic but because he had no patience
[1:20:02] he got another ship to take him to
[1:20:05] america
[1:20:06] on a trip that he had some supplies to
[1:20:08] come to the house
[1:20:10] or he would have been on the titanic
[1:20:12] himself
[1:20:14] i'm not even going to go there but but
[1:20:18] but you see god has predestinated
[1:20:20] moments for everything
[1:20:23] and i i've been through the house on a
[1:20:25] few occasions and
[1:20:27] actually we have stayed on the grounds
[1:20:29] on an anniversary and
[1:20:30] it was it's a nice place to be at but
[1:20:33] you think the glory of that building was
[1:20:36] almost 100 years ago and after it's
[1:20:39] finished he gets to
[1:20:41] live in it about 19 years and as i was
[1:20:44] just evolving in
[1:20:46] these thoughts this week i said andrew i
[1:20:48] said this man
[1:20:49] lived in this great vast beautiful home
[1:20:52] with servants and
[1:20:54] he had big dogs and they they would sit
[1:20:56] on the porch and that was his favorite
[1:20:58] place to set was on the porch and he
[1:21:00] and he only got to live there 19 years
[1:21:03] you think about
[1:21:03] 19 years it's nothing that says
[1:21:06] absolutely nothing
[1:21:08] but now tours goes through there every
[1:21:10] day
[1:21:11] by the thousands of people they tour
[1:21:15] and they get to look back in a glimpse
[1:21:18] of another life
[1:21:20] though we're in 2020 you just can be
[1:21:22] transported back to the
[1:21:24] early 1900s and you kind of just feel
[1:21:28] the atmosphere of what it must have been
[1:21:30] like there
[1:21:31] how they must have conducted things
[1:21:35] so now i just give you a little setting
[1:21:37] for a vision
[1:21:39] so now i'm touring buildings
[1:21:43] and i'm watching i'm watching as the
[1:21:46] vision is going and i'm touring
[1:21:48] buildings
[1:21:49] and it seems like there's a little
[1:21:51] little group that is
[1:21:52] that is going through these buildings
[1:21:54] and you know
[1:21:57] as i become to realize that these
[1:21:59] buildings had now been vacant
[1:22:01] for a couple of years and they're just
[1:22:05] being opened up and we're touring
[1:22:07] through the building and
[1:22:09] you know if you close a building up and
[1:22:11] the air conditions is not working and
[1:22:14] there becomes spider webs and dust and
[1:22:17] it gets a smell to it and it gets that
[1:22:20] vacant feeling
[1:22:22] it don't stay beautiful and clean and
[1:22:28] fresh as i begin to tour these buildings
[1:22:31] i
[1:22:32] i as i toured one after another and it
[1:22:35] would just seem like
[1:22:36] in a vision i i can't explain it to you
[1:22:38] seemed like a long time but it's
[1:22:40] probably just seconds
[1:22:42] and i just i just begun to go from one
[1:22:44] place to another
[1:22:45] i noticed how that the the the
[1:22:48] the cobwebs were hanging and and the
[1:22:52] and the guide that was taking these
[1:22:54] people through
[1:22:56] these people were very curious about
[1:22:59] what happened here
[1:23:00] and they went and and i began to notice
[1:23:03] and i noticed one after another building
[1:23:05] and only in hindsight would i recognize
[1:23:08] of what i've been involved in
[1:23:11] and then i then i'm in this one building
[1:23:13] and i'm kind of standing in a
[1:23:15] in a place in the back of the building
[1:23:18] kind of looking down and watching the
[1:23:20] people come under me and
[1:23:22] as they're coming under me there's a man
[1:23:24] standing and he's a bearded man
[1:23:26] he reminds me of what peter must have
[1:23:28] been like
[1:23:30] and so these people begin to ask said
[1:23:33] we've toured these buildings and
[1:23:36] some are smaller some are bigger
[1:23:40] what happened here what happened here
[1:23:44] why are these buildings like they are
[1:23:46] what happened here
[1:23:50] and this man speaks and he says these
[1:23:53] are the buildings
[1:23:55] to which that a people once inhabited
[1:24:00] but they were raptured
[1:24:04] and they were gone immediately
[1:24:12] and i recognized i was in temperate
[1:24:14] building
[1:24:15] at that spot and then in hindsight i
[1:24:18] would remember
[1:24:20] being in a man named jason jackson's
[1:24:22] building
[1:24:23] and it just flipped through of this
[1:24:25] churches that i had been in
[1:24:27] and now they're vacant and this building
[1:24:31] vacant
[1:24:32] this building the cobwebs
[1:24:38] i'll be honest with you when i came out
[1:24:39] of that i thought i was being raptured
[1:24:42] the atmosphere of that i was thinking
[1:24:45] we're getting ready to go home because
[1:24:49] now this past present
[1:24:53] future
[1:24:57] the blending of time
[1:25:01] these buildings will set empty
[1:25:05] oh sure some of them will be used for
[1:25:07] storehouses
[1:25:08] we could care less
[1:25:11] are you with me but here we sit in it
[1:25:14] and
[1:25:15] and we've had glorious meetings in it
[1:25:18] now i'm going to gather my thoughts and
[1:25:19] i'm going to finish
[1:25:21] we've had glorious meetings in it
[1:25:25] like branham meetings to which that
[1:25:27] people would come for a couple of hours
[1:25:29] before
[1:25:30] and set to hear the word of god we've
[1:25:33] had the dead raised here
[1:25:35] we've had cancer healed here we've had
[1:25:38] some of the worst sin
[1:25:39] cases healed here and cured here and
[1:25:42] became
[1:25:43] real citizens of the kingdom of god
[1:25:47] and when this place sets full of two to
[1:25:50] three hundred people of our normal
[1:25:52] people
[1:25:52] we sit here and the presence of god
[1:25:56] echoes across this building
[1:25:59] i'm sure you could turn the lights on
[1:26:02] but that don't create an atmosphere
[1:26:04] you can turn the heating air on but that
[1:26:06] don't create an atmosphere
[1:26:08] but you let one son of god
[1:26:11] somebody help me preach you let one son
[1:26:14] of god
[1:26:14] walk into the building with an
[1:26:16] expectation to meet god on these grounds
[1:26:21] come on church and we walk in and we
[1:26:24] take our spot
[1:26:25] and we prepare to worship the lord
[1:26:30] hallelujah you may be at home
[1:26:33] you may be watching this service you may
[1:26:36] archive these services
[1:26:38] but i want you to know what you're
[1:26:40] experiencing now
[1:26:42] is only temporary
[1:26:45] i don't know if we'll return to the
[1:26:46] great mass meetings that we've had
[1:26:48] but i will tell you this there's coming
[1:26:51] a rapture
[1:26:54] there's coming a rapture the abraham and
[1:26:58] sarah that set at that
[1:26:59] tent in only a matter of days weeks
[1:27:03] months they had a body change
[1:27:08] can i reach and just grab it just for a
[1:27:09] moment what if you were their neighbor
[1:27:15] and you heard the testimonies of before
[1:27:26] andrew can you set a chair here for me
[1:27:28] real quickly
[1:27:33] set two chairs
[1:27:44] i'm gonna go ahead and get comfortable
[1:27:47] okay here can sit here with me
[1:27:53] i'll tell you andrew i met him
[1:27:57] i met him the other night something
[1:28:00] pulled me out of the tent
[1:28:02] i went up on the hill
[1:28:06] i got by that special place
[1:28:10] he called my name
[1:28:14] he told me i'll be your shield and i'll
[1:28:17] be your buckler
[1:28:19] i heard his voice i i i know i can't
[1:28:23] explain it
[1:28:24] i heard his voice i'm gonna make a
[1:28:27] covenant between me and thee
[1:28:32] and i'm gonna bless you everything you
[1:28:35] see i'm gonna give it to you
[1:28:38] abraham i'm gonna give you children
[1:28:42] i'll tell you andrew i can't explain
[1:28:45] what he looks like
[1:28:47] sometimes he comes like a pillar of fire
[1:28:50] sometimes i just hear his voice i
[1:28:56] cut the beast up and he comes and
[1:28:58] consumes the beast
[1:29:02] i'll tell you i thought i knew who
[1:29:05] abraham was
[1:29:09] but when god told me who abraham was
[1:29:15] i'll tell you andrew you've been my
[1:29:18] neighbor you've been a great neighbor
[1:29:19] through these years
[1:29:21] you've been a great boy but i tell you
[1:29:24] i'm gonna have a son
[1:29:27] i know i'm getting old but i'm gonna
[1:29:29] have a son
[1:29:31] the other day he was at the tent and he
[1:29:34] was a man
[1:29:35] what the voice was was a man and i'll
[1:29:38] tell you
[1:29:39] when i looked into his deep set eyes it
[1:29:41] looked like he was looking right
[1:29:42] straight through me
[1:29:48] you may not believe this but this
[1:29:52] this body is going to have a son
[1:29:56] i'm gonna i'm gonna have a son
[1:29:59] and sarah i'm gonna have it by sarah she
[1:30:01] don't believe it but i'll tell you
[1:30:03] andrew
[1:30:05] the other day when he revealed the
[1:30:06] secret of her heart she
[1:30:08] changed in just a second she changed
[1:30:12] i've been working on her for decades but
[1:30:14] in a second her atmosphere was just
[1:30:17] it was just so different andrew i tell
[1:30:20] you it's like
[1:30:20] living with a different wife
[1:30:25] let's fast forward just a little bit and
[1:30:26] you move with me
[1:30:31] it's me it's me i'm abraham
[1:30:34] i know you can't really believe it but
[1:30:37] i'm the same one that met him on the
[1:30:39] hill and i'm the same one that met him
[1:30:41] at the tent
[1:30:42] and you knew me as an old man and
[1:30:44] gray-haired and beard and
[1:30:46] my body was deteriorating but i'll tell
[1:30:48] you what he told me
[1:30:51] is taking place in my body just waited
[1:30:54] you see sarah
[1:30:56] that's what i'm talking about just wait
[1:30:59] till you see her
[1:31:01] this message is working
[1:31:07] can i fast forward just a little bit
[1:31:11] come here isaac come here buddy
[1:31:16] he sat down and you're looking at him
[1:31:20] you're grey-headed now you're old age
[1:31:23] now but abraham's younger than you
[1:31:25] now and isaac's jumped up on his
[1:31:29] knee and he's kissing him and wrestling
[1:31:32] him around
[1:31:33] you see what was a vision now's reality
[1:31:39] i want to tell you andrew
[1:31:48] many years ago
[1:31:51] your grandfather and i saw that you were
[1:31:53] a preacher
[1:31:59] there's a lot of people got jealous that
[1:32:01] we
[1:32:02] we saw you as a preacher
[1:32:05] and they got mad and some have been left
[1:32:10] because they couldn't see what we saw
[1:32:13] now i'm preaching now
[1:32:17] now i've came to the end of my sermon
[1:32:19] and i'm preaching
[1:32:22] so that which was prophetic
[1:32:26] which was in the future
[1:32:30] then become real and came into time
[1:32:34] oh yeah you were a silly boy
[1:32:37] you were a real silly boy i tried to get
[1:32:40] the silliness out of you but after a
[1:32:41] while i figured it was going to stay
[1:32:43] forever
[1:32:47] but that's what made you special
[1:32:51] and one day jesus came into your life
[1:33:01] it was kind of like sarah
[1:33:06] when she actually figured out who she
[1:33:08] was
[1:33:12] she became a part of the promise
[1:33:17] now andrew i'm not just talking to you
[1:33:19] i'm talking to all of these pews sitting
[1:33:22] here
[1:33:25] when people figure out who they are
[1:33:29] at that same melchizedek that same jesus
[1:33:33] has talked to them all of these years
[1:33:39] and it becomes so real until they
[1:33:43] realize
[1:33:43] it wasn't about me it was all about him
[1:33:50] and all we had jobs and we had homes and
[1:33:53] we had
[1:33:54] cars and we had we had good times and we
[1:33:57] had bad times
[1:34:03] now andrew what other people couldn't
[1:34:06] see god already saw
[1:34:09] in another dimension they already see
[1:34:11] things that
[1:34:13] we can't see because time has been taken
[1:34:16] away
[1:34:18] and everything is known as god knows
[1:34:22] so they know you for who you really are
[1:34:25] you don't have to convince them you
[1:34:28] don't have to tell them
[1:34:29] i'm the great andrew spencer because
[1:34:32] it's not we're not the ones that's great
[1:34:34] it's he's great
[1:34:36] that's right you see if you put your
[1:34:38] finger in a bucket of water and pull it
[1:34:40] out
[1:34:41] and figure out where the hole is well
[1:34:43] that's just about how
[1:34:44] important we are but the one that's
[1:34:47] important is jesus
[1:34:50] amen andrew
[1:34:54] i don't know when
[1:34:58] i don't know what days it'll be
[1:35:02] but just like abraham talked to his
[1:35:04] neighbor andrew
[1:35:07] one day they walked into the tent
[1:35:11] oh creaking
[1:35:16] and the next day they walked out
[1:35:20] that's right one day we're walking to
[1:35:24] this
[1:35:26] church
[1:35:28] there'll be good atmosphere here and bad
[1:35:31] atmosphere
[1:35:32] there'll be people that want to be here
[1:35:34] and then there'll be people that don't
[1:35:36] want to be here
[1:35:38] you know you now andrew
[1:35:42] worry about goats they'll always be
[1:35:44] goats
[1:35:46] you know and don't spend don't spend all
[1:35:49] your time on worrying about goats that
[1:35:50] really don't want to be here
[1:35:52] you just preach to sheep and you see
[1:35:55] sheep's going to take a rapture
[1:35:57] goats are going to stay they'll quit
[1:36:00] they'll be glad they're actually glad
[1:36:01] covet came
[1:36:10] i'm having too much good but this is
[1:36:12] true
[1:36:14] but i'm going to tell you andrew you
[1:36:16] just keep preaching what this
[1:36:18] word says
[1:36:22] and regardless of the circumstances
[1:36:24] around it
[1:36:25] past present future
[1:36:31] we could look back two years after the
[1:36:35] rapture happens
[1:36:37] and see the cobwebs in this building
[1:36:41] but you see there was a time for us to
[1:36:43] be here
[1:36:45] and then there's a time for us to be
[1:36:46] there
[1:36:50] there was a time that had iraq
[1:36:54] prayed for her boys and there was a time
[1:36:58] that she just knew they're okay
[1:37:02] i just thank the lord for it
[1:37:05] sister connie there's a time
[1:37:08] that ron spencer wrestled in the night
[1:37:14] with this cancer threw up through the
[1:37:17] day
[1:37:19] got weak had to have naps that probably
[1:37:22] won't finish
[1:37:23] but
[1:37:26] there will be a time to where ron
[1:37:28] spencer
[1:37:30] will be 100 percent healed
[1:37:36] [Applause]
[1:37:42] i know there's probably only 10 or 12 15
[1:37:45] of us here
[1:37:46] we really don't have a number difference
[1:37:47] the
[1:37:50] health department's really thrilled with
[1:37:51] how we're handling things and we thank
[1:37:53] the lord for that but
[1:37:56] but let me just say this to you
[1:38:00] whatever you do in life
[1:38:04] don't miss seeing who jesus is
[1:38:11] and if i could take it just a little bit
[1:38:13] higher
[1:38:15] whatever you do in life
[1:38:18] don't miss seeing who you are
[1:38:25] because let me say this to you you can
[1:38:28] waste a whole lot of time
[1:38:31] spinning a whole lot of wheels
[1:38:34] trying to live somebody else's life for
[1:38:36] them
[1:38:39] or you can fall in love with jesus
[1:38:44] fall in love with this word this message
[1:38:48] and that's what this message is is jesus
[1:38:51] not brother branham
[1:38:53] no no no but but jesus
[1:38:57] she fall in love with him and that
[1:38:59] atmosphere
[1:39:01] that atmosphere that was there with an
[1:39:03] infidel on a porch
[1:39:05] right you notice
[1:39:08] brother branham didn't get him to try to
[1:39:10] fall in love with him
[1:39:11] he got him to fall in love with jesus
[1:39:13] yeah what about burke call
[1:39:15] yeah brother brown said oh lizard dies
[1:39:20] meanest man i ever met right
[1:39:23] brother ron but that's brother branham
[1:39:25] what about a naked man on a boat
[1:39:29] cursing
[1:39:33] and this guy standing over here that's
[1:39:35] homeless
[1:39:36] tells him cast your net on the other
[1:39:40] side
[1:39:41] i've been tolling all night long
[1:39:45] just cast your net on the other side
[1:39:48] when he really met who jesus was
[1:39:52] his concern was not fishing anymore
[1:39:56] his concern was being with that man that
[1:39:58] spoke to his heart
[1:40:00] and there was something about his voice
[1:40:03] that was greater than
[1:40:05] anything he ever heard in his life sure
[1:40:08] seeing the withered hands being restored
[1:40:11] the eyes being healed and the dead being
[1:40:14] raised and
[1:40:15] rolling the stones away and watching the
[1:40:18] fish be duplicated
[1:40:20] but now jesus is asking him to go to the
[1:40:23] upper room
[1:40:27] and he'll share the testimony of who
[1:40:30] jesus really was
[1:40:33] not some man's imagination but who jesus
[1:40:36] really was
[1:40:40] you might share it in walmart you might
[1:40:44] share it in kroger's
[1:40:47] you might share it at your salon
[1:40:49] wherever you go
[1:40:51] you might share it on your job
[1:40:54] you might share it where we're maybe in
[1:40:57] a barber chair
[1:41:01] and all of a sudden a warm presence
[1:41:04] comes by
[1:41:06] that same jesus
[1:41:09] i'd like for that same jesus to live in
[1:41:12] our lives
[1:41:16] you might criticize me for telling a
[1:41:18] vision today
[1:41:20] but you see it was that kind of presence
[1:41:23] that it's here right now that's right
[1:41:26] you see i don't have to lie for no man
[1:41:29] i don't have to embellish
[1:41:34] i would share this with brother tim
[1:41:35] pruitt
[1:41:41] and brother tim would say you know when
[1:41:42] we first built our building
[1:41:47] he said may this building be a memorial
[1:41:52] for people they passed by to see
[1:41:56] there was a bride that was here
[1:41:59] may this building be that kind of a
[1:42:01] building
[1:42:03] that this building would be built on
[1:42:05] this hill and
[1:42:07] i i don't care what's done with it after
[1:42:09] we leave but
[1:42:11] you know i'd like to say that
[1:42:16] maybe people would go by with a
[1:42:18] reverence i know
[1:42:19] people that once lived on the earth
[1:42:22] they're gone now i don't know or some
[1:42:24] hooky spooks about it but
[1:42:26] they're gone now they're gone they
[1:42:30] believe some sort of a message but
[1:42:31] they're gone now
[1:42:37] what about your home
[1:42:43] past present
[1:42:47] future
[1:42:51] your name is ron spencer
[1:42:55] you had cancer
[1:42:59] it's gone now it's gone now
[1:43:05] hallelujah brother ron i'd like to stood
[1:43:09] in the meetings with brother branham

[1:44:19] you know it was him you've never made me
[1:44:22] before
[1:44:24] but there's just something about him
