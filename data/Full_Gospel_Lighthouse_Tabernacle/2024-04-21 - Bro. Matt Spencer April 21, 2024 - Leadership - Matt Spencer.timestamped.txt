[55:10] as he's speaking this morning as we
[55:11] prayed about there that God would just
[55:14] bless them I know they'll enjoy that
[55:16] won't they amen we certainly enjoy him
[55:19] and I enjoyed brother William last night
[55:22] amen amen if you missed it go back and
[55:24] listen to it that was great that's the
[55:25] message
[55:27] that's the message right there amen
[55:30] maybe this morning we'll turn uh first
[55:31] to Isaiah 41 and verse 10 thank you
[55:35] musician sorry about
[55:41] that this morning I'd like to speak on
[55:43] leadership and uh I'd like to take it
[55:46] from a subject of Nehemiah this morning
[55:49] and so as we go about this I'm going to
[55:52] build a little bit of a foundation I
[55:54] know we're going to be building a wall
[55:55] so we're to build a foundation first and
[55:58] I don't mean to take away from Andrew's
[56:00] sermons of Jericho about building walls
[56:04] he's been turning them down we're going
[56:06] to build
[56:09] them I I'm not trying to do that or take
[56:12] away from what he's been preaching there
[56:13] so so don't think that I'm trying to
[56:15] combat what he's been doing here
[56:18] so so this morning it'll be uh
[56:21] leadership amen so Isaiah 41 and10 it
[56:24] says
[56:26] fear thou not for I am with thee be not
[56:30] dismayed for I am thy God I will
[56:33] strengthen thee yay I will help thee yay
[56:38] I will uphold thee in with the right
[56:41] hand of my
[56:43] righteousness and maybe we'll turn to
[56:45] Psalms 37 and verse
[56:48] 5 if they could just put it up there on
[56:50] the board for you you can read it there
[56:52] says commit thy way unto the Lord trust
[56:56] also in him and he shall bring it to
[57:00] pass so for us to be led we must have a
[57:04] god he's our God this morning isn't he
[57:07] amen you can be seated at this
[57:09] time pray for the blessings of the word
[57:11] of the Lord this
[57:14] morning so as we go about leadership
[57:17] this
[57:18] morning I want to just uh as i s said
[57:22] build a foundation on where I want to go
[57:24] here but leadership is about building
[57:26] trust creating a shared vision and
[57:29] rallying people around a common purpose
[57:32] it's about recognizing the strengths of
[57:35] each individual and leveraging them to
[57:38] achieve Collective
[57:40] success amen that's a little bit of a
[57:42] leadership there you know it's not all
[57:44] about one person it's about helping
[57:46] people find their purpose to find a
[57:50] successful solution leadership is also
[57:53] termed as influence if you have
[57:56] leadership you have influence so what is
[57:59] influence there's good and bad influence
[58:02] and in a day and age of social media
[58:04] there is a lot of
[58:06] influence not all of it's good influence
[58:09] everybody wants to be an
[58:11] influencer but they don't want to lead
[58:13] you in the correct way amen so you must
[58:18] watch your leadership who you are
[58:21] following because we are all following
[58:23] someone to a certain purpose so make it
[58:27] Christ amen that's right
[58:30] amen so with Nehemiah to
[58:34] be to go where we'd like to go this
[58:37] morning I want to
[58:39] just we want to recognize the purpose of
[58:42] the wall being built now Nehemiah
[58:45] building the wall God just didn't just
[58:48] want walls you know if God wanted walls
[58:51] he can just say walls be built but we
[58:54] want to find the purpose of Nehemiah
[58:56] here why was there need of walls so we
[59:00] look to Daniel and verse 9 this morning
[59:03] and verse
[59:04] one and it says in verse one in the
[59:07] first year of Darius the son of aus the
[59:11] seed of the mes which was made King over
[59:15] the realm of the Cal Chaldeans in the
[59:18] first year of his Reign I Daniel
[59:22] understood by the books of the number of
[59:25] years where whereof the number where
[59:28] whereof the word of the Lord came to
[59:31] Jeremiah the prophet see he looked to
[59:35] see what Jeremiah had
[59:38] prophesied so but he understood what
[59:41] Jeremiah had prophesied here he went to
[59:44] the books he had to have an
[59:46] understanding of what he had
[59:49] prophesied and said the Lord came to
[59:52] Jeremiah the prophet that he would
[59:54] accomplish 70 years years of the
[59:57] desolation of Jerusalem so we see that
[1:00:00] the Jews had been cast out they had been
[1:00:04] destroyed they had pushed out scattered
[1:00:07] abroad and Jeremiah was saying that it
[1:00:10] would be 70 years in
[1:00:13] Desolation then we go down to Daniel in
[1:00:16] verse 20 and Daniel here says while I
[1:00:19] was speaking and praying and confessing
[1:00:22] my sin and the sin of My People Israel
[1:00:26] and presenting the supplication before
[1:00:29] the Lord my God for the Holy Mountain of
[1:00:33] my God yay while I was speaking in
[1:00:36] prayer even the man Gabriel Angel
[1:00:40] Gabriel came unto him and if you would
[1:00:43] like to go back and review where I'm
[1:00:46] getting a lot of this this morning go to
[1:00:48] Gabriel's instruction brother brandham
[1:00:50] speaking that and this is where brother
[1:00:53] brandham will tell about all these
[1:00:54] things and what we are talking about
[1:00:57] this morning and helps you understand
[1:00:59] the 70 and 70 weeks said while I was
[1:01:02] speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel
[1:01:05] whom I had seen in a vision at the
[1:01:08] beginning being caused to
[1:01:12] fly swiftly touched me about the time of
[1:01:16] the evening oblation and he informed me
[1:01:21] and talked with me and said oh Daniel I
[1:01:23] am now come forth to give thee skill an
[1:01:26] understanding okay so we see he is in
[1:01:29] prayer and Gabriel's come to him to help
[1:01:31] him understand what he has read of
[1:01:34] Jeremiah the prophet here and says
[1:01:38] excuse me I lost my place and the
[1:01:39] beginning of thy supplications the
[1:01:41] Commandment came forth and I come to
[1:01:44] show thee for thou art greatly beloved
[1:01:47] therefore understand the matter and
[1:01:50] consider the vision 70 weeks now
[1:01:53] understand this 70 weeks are determined
[1:01:57] upon thy people thy people meaning the
[1:02:00] Jews amen not the Gentiles it is the
[1:02:03] Jews in in this that we're talking of
[1:02:05] because they have been scattered it's
[1:02:07] thy people that are coming back into the
[1:02:09] city they're starting to come back but
[1:02:12] they are not there yet do we understand
[1:02:15] that so they're coming back into the
[1:02:18] holy city to finish the transgression to
[1:02:21] make an end to sins and to make the
[1:02:24] Recon reconciliation
[1:02:26] of iniquity and to bring the Everlasting
[1:02:30] righteousness and to seal up the vision
[1:02:32] and prophecy and to the and to the
[1:02:37] anoint the most holy know therefore and
[1:02:41] understand that from the going forth of
[1:02:43] the Commandment to the
[1:02:45] restore and the build Jerusalem unto
[1:02:49] Messiah the prince shall be 70 weeks now
[1:02:54] understand the G Angel Gabriel is
[1:02:57] speaking to him it says Daniel
[1:03:00] understand when the walls are being
[1:03:02] built start the clock on
[1:03:06] Messiah messiah's coming but this is the
[1:03:09] reason why it had to be done do you
[1:03:12] understand because he had given the time
[1:03:15] frame brother Brandon would say that if
[1:03:18] you want to know what day it is you look
[1:03:20] at the calendar if you want to know what
[1:03:22] day we're living in watch the Jews watch
[1:03:26] Israel so what what are we seeing in
[1:03:28] this day what are we see a rise up of of
[1:03:32] people against Israel it's that same
[1:03:35] Spirit that's going to take us out of
[1:03:36] here amen as brother William was just
[1:03:40] explaining it so perfectly last night
[1:03:42] and I actually told him I said good I
[1:03:44] wish you'd have went on that that way I
[1:03:46] could have played a tape or watched Ben
[1:03:47] her or something this
[1:03:51] morning but he was explaining about the
[1:03:54] bride and and her being called away amen
[1:03:58] and then that
[1:04:00] 144,000 that that those Jews that are
[1:04:03] consecrated Jews that were there and
[1:04:06] then the tribulation that should come so
[1:04:08] if you want to take this all back just
[1:04:10] take it to Daniel Daniel says when you
[1:04:13] hear about the walls being built that's
[1:04:16] when you start the clock on Messiah amen
[1:04:20] amen and so we look forward and brother
[1:04:22] Brandon would say you start from there
[1:04:24] it's 480 6 years from the time that
[1:04:27] Daniel two years before this has heard
[1:04:30] this and got the vision of the prophecy
[1:04:33] so it's prophecy fulfilled of the walls
[1:04:36] being
[1:04:37] built let me go on
[1:04:40] here Messiah the
[1:04:42] prince shall seven weeks and three score
[1:04:45] and two weeks the street shall be built
[1:04:48] again and the wall even in trouble's
[1:04:51] times and after three score and two
[1:04:53] weeks shall Messiah who is Messiah here
[1:04:57] it's Jesus Christ shall be cut off but
[1:05:00] not for himself who's it
[1:05:04] for for his people and the people of the
[1:05:07] prince that shall come shall destroy the
[1:05:10] city and the sanctuary and the end
[1:05:13] thereof shall be with floods and unto
[1:05:16] the end of the war desolations are
[1:05:20] determined and shall confirm the
[1:05:22] Covenant with many for one week and in
[1:05:27] the midst of the week shall he cause the
[1:05:31] sacrifice of the oblation oblation to
[1:05:35] cease and for the overspreading of the
[1:05:38] Abomination he shall make it desolate
[1:05:41] even unto the
[1:05:43] consummation that and that determined
[1:05:46] shall be poured upon the Desolation so
[1:05:49] we see what that is it's Jesus Christ
[1:05:51] you go forward from this point of the
[1:05:54] walls being starting to be built
[1:05:57] 483 years it is and that and that is
[1:06:01] Christ coming down Mount of Olives so as
[1:06:03] brother William was saying last night
[1:06:06] you see in Matthew let's turn to Matthew
[1:06:10] Hallelujah 21 I believe it is here yes
[1:06:14] I'm sorry to read a bunch of scriptures
[1:06:16] here but I want I want to bring this to
[1:06:18] you and make sure it's correct and you
[1:06:19] understand it here and so you you move
[1:06:22] the clock and it's Matthew 21 he's
[1:06:25] coming down off the mount said go into
[1:06:27] the village over against you and
[1:06:30] straightway you shall you shall find the
[1:06:32] ass tide and the cult uh with her loose
[1:06:37] them and bring them unto me and if any
[1:06:42] man say ought unto you ye shall say the
[1:06:45] Lord hath need of them and straightway
[1:06:48] he shall send them and all of this was
[1:06:52] done that it might be fulfilled which
[1:06:55] was spoken by the prophet saying tell ye
[1:06:57] the daughter of Zion behold the king
[1:07:01] cometh unto the meek see he's coming the
[1:07:05] cult the full of an ass he's come upon a
[1:07:07] donkey the meek as brother William was
[1:07:09] explaining it last night he's not riding
[1:07:11] a charger he's not riding a horse he's
[1:07:13] riding the donkey cult the full of an
[1:07:15] ass into the city amen Messiah coming
[1:07:18] down off the mountain amen and in verse
[1:07:22] in chapter 24 Jesus is speaking and it's
[1:07:27] Daniel's uh the abomination of
[1:07:29] desolation here and it says in verse 24
[1:07:33] in chapter 24 and verse 15 when ye
[1:07:37] therefore shall see the abomination of
[1:07:40] desolation spoken by Daniel the Prophet
[1:07:44] stand in the Holy place whosoever
[1:07:47] readeth let him understand we have to
[1:07:51] have an understanding we have to have
[1:07:54] the guide this morning to be able to
[1:07:56] have that understanding of what's being
[1:07:58] Spoken Here amen so what we're seeing is
[1:08:02] the abomination of desolation so Titus
[1:08:06] that would go into and destroy those
[1:08:08] cities those Jews there and cause to be
[1:08:11] desolate then you see what it is that
[1:08:14] tribulation period that is coming that's
[1:08:17] going to be an end in Revelations 19 19
[1:08:21] you see that what is it the end time
[1:08:23] there the Armageddon that is coming upon
[1:08:26] it amen so all of these things tie
[1:08:29] together this morning and we have to
[1:08:31] have the guide the Holy Ghost to lead us
[1:08:35] into all of this I know I have just said
[1:08:38] a lot and if you don't understand it
[1:08:41] just ask My Chauffeur brother
[1:08:45] Adam amen if y'all don't know that
[1:08:48] that's a uh there was
[1:08:51] a professor one time he uh he kept going
[1:08:54] to all these things and given the same
[1:08:56] speech over and over and over again and
[1:08:58] a chauffeur one day said you know you
[1:09:01] give that same speech over and over and
[1:09:03] over and I could do it just as good he
[1:09:06] said all right you do it this morning so
[1:09:10] they switched position he became the
[1:09:11] chauffeur and he became the professor
[1:09:14] got up and he did the exact same thing
[1:09:16] gave the same speech all over again and
[1:09:20] a student stood up and gave him some
[1:09:22] equation great equation said now
[1:09:24] Professor can
[1:09:26] can you tell us and explain this to us
[1:09:28] he said why that is the dumbest question
[1:09:32] I have ever heard in my life I tell you
[1:09:35] how dumb it is it's so dumb that you can
[1:09:37] ask my chauffeur and he'll tell
[1:09:42] you amen so not that you have any dumb
[1:09:45] questions this morning but if you have
[1:09:48] any questions about what I just said
[1:09:49] just ask My Chauffeur brother
[1:09:52] Andrew I'll pass the buck this morning
[1:09:54] on them
[1:09:56] amen isn't God good to us amen amen so
[1:09:59] do you understand where we're at this
[1:10:01] morning and prophecy being fulfilled and
[1:10:04] the understanding of what Daniel had
[1:10:06] read
[1:10:10] there so let me get into Nehemiah this
[1:10:13] morning and you wonder why would I
[1:10:16] choose Nehemiah well there's so much
[1:10:18] leadership and uh Nehemiah and you can
[1:10:22] go through Ezra Nehemiah Esther and all
[1:10:24] those books there and there's so much
[1:10:27] leadership in every single one of them
[1:10:29] and it helps us in this day and age amen
[1:10:33] so as we go to Nehemiah this morning we
[1:10:35] understand why the walls had to be built
[1:10:38] amen it was a prophecy fulfilled but it
[1:10:41] was a drawing of the Jews back into the
[1:10:45] city amen because they had been
[1:10:47] scattered abroad okay and what it was is
[1:10:52] the Jews had to find their identity
[1:10:55] right amen they had to find their
[1:10:57] identity once again because they had
[1:10:59] broken off Covenant with the
[1:11:01] Lord and so we go to Nehemiah and one
[1:11:05] and just bear with me this morning and I
[1:11:07] just pray that it all goes as planned
[1:11:10] you know sometimes it don't but praise
[1:11:12] the
[1:11:13] Lord in Nehemiah 1 and one it says in
[1:11:17] the words of Nehemiah the son of heal
[1:11:20] and it came to pass in the month of
[1:11:22] cheso in the 20th year at I was in
[1:11:26] shushan the palace and I may not get any
[1:11:30] of these words correctly so y'all bear
[1:11:31] with me amen that hanani one of my
[1:11:36] brethren came he and certain men of
[1:11:38] Judah and I asked them concerning the
[1:11:41] Jews that had escaped which there which
[1:11:45] were left in captivity concerning
[1:11:49] Jerusalem so I I want you to see
[1:11:51] Nehemiah this at this point where where
[1:11:55] he was at he was in the Palace of
[1:11:57] shushan the palace and he was a cup
[1:12:01] Bearer to the king aerus Artic Xerxes
[1:12:05] I'm sorry 20th year of Artic Xerxes
[1:12:09] we'll get there but what it was he was
[1:12:11] the cup Bearer to the king there and he
[1:12:14] had a position at this point and he had
[1:12:18] a burden for his people upon his heart
[1:12:21] so he asked about this so but to be able
[1:12:25] to be in a place of where he was at I
[1:12:28] just want to explain or just talk a
[1:12:30] little bit Nehemiah had to be a person
[1:12:33] that was loved by the people so the king
[1:12:36] chose a person that the people loved
[1:12:40] just as much as they would love him
[1:12:42] maybe even more because the cup bearer
[1:12:44] was the one that would taste the food
[1:12:46] the wines thereof before the king would
[1:12:49] eat it so he wouldn't be poisoned so he
[1:12:53] had to be a trusted individual
[1:12:55] with all the people in the city there
[1:12:59] and he had to be liked by all of the
[1:13:01] people because if he wasn't liked hey
[1:13:04] well let's just poison Nehemiah and
[1:13:05] we'll get another cup Bear right I mean
[1:13:08] easy done but he had to be like he had
[1:13:10] to have something about him where he
[1:13:12] would be walking down the marketplace
[1:13:15] and he would just go along and he'd
[1:13:17] maybe talk with somebody selling oranges
[1:13:19] or fruit or something and ask about
[1:13:21] their day and have a heart for them you
[1:13:25] understand what I'm saying there is
[1:13:27] there was something that was drawing
[1:13:29] them to his people amen he had a need
[1:13:33] for his people and the first part of
[1:13:35] leadership is it's not about you amen it
[1:13:39] it it is not about you being a leader I
[1:13:41] I if you want to be in the star and the
[1:13:43] glamour thereof I'm a leader I'm a
[1:13:46] leader I'm a leader you're not going to
[1:13:48] be one if you want to be a star go to
[1:13:51] Hollywood create a social media page
[1:13:54] yeah be a leader at that point but if
[1:13:57] you want to be a star you won't be able
[1:13:59] to do that
[1:14:00] there okay so he had a need upon his
[1:14:04] heart for the
[1:14:05] people and he asked them and they said
[1:14:08] unto them the
[1:14:10] remnant that are left in the Captivity
[1:14:13] there in the Providence are in great
[1:14:16] Affliction and reproach and the wall of
[1:14:18] Jerusalem is broken down and the gates
[1:14:21] thereof are burned with fire so this
[1:14:25] what he heard about his people gave him
[1:14:28] great stress made him very sad my people
[1:14:31] is in
[1:14:32] burden so what did what is the first
[1:14:35] thing that he does in verse four it says
[1:14:38] and it came to pass when I heard of
[1:14:40] these words I sat down and I wept and
[1:14:42] mourned certain days fasted and prayed
[1:14:45] before God Of
[1:14:48] Heaven the first thing he did first
[1:14:51] thing a leader should do yeah go to
[1:14:54] prayer that's right Hallelujah the first
[1:14:56] thing a leader will do is go to prayer
[1:15:00] Amen in
[1:15:02] Psalms excuse me Proverbs 12: 15 it says
[1:15:07] the way of a fool is right in his own
[1:15:09] eyes but he that hearkeneth unto counsel
[1:15:13] is wise so what did Nehemiah do the
[1:15:16] first thing he did went to
[1:15:18] prayer in every situation of your life
[1:15:21] go to prayer go to pray the first first
[1:15:25] thing right that now this is not a
[1:15:27] leadership skill but is something that
[1:15:29] you can help with your leadership
[1:15:31] abilities amen go to prayer about the
[1:15:35] situation so as he's now in prayer he
[1:15:39] there is a problem so if there is a
[1:15:42] problem you now have an opportunity and
[1:15:45] so many times people in life miss their
[1:15:49] opportunity because they're expecting
[1:15:51] something great and they just blow off
[1:15:55] yeah they they don't understand what the
[1:15:57] Lord has for them you need to understand
[1:16:01] that God's just not going to Lord I pray
[1:16:03] that I'm wealthy well if you're praying
[1:16:06] for wealth you're praying for the wrong
[1:16:08] thing God's not just going to sit down
[1:16:11] and take what the Lord has given you and
[1:16:15] do something with
[1:16:17] it I I I want to just tell a little bit
[1:16:19] of a testimony here and a lot of you
[1:16:21] will understand so back in September
[1:16:25] about the third second third week in
[1:16:27] September uh brother Ron was speaking
[1:16:30] here and I was actually in the car and a
[1:16:34] lot of you don't know this but I had had
[1:16:35] pink eye so I had sit in the car there
[1:16:39] went to the doctor come back and I was
[1:16:41] streaming service I was sitting outside
[1:16:42] in the car and brother Ron had brother
[1:16:45] William and brother Andrew stand
[1:16:47] up and he said pronounce the blessing
[1:16:50] upon each of their
[1:16:52] businesses y'all remember that y'all y a
[1:16:55] lot of you are here a lot of streaming
[1:16:56] in a lot of people claimed that blessing
[1:16:59] even for themselves a lot of you claimed
[1:17:02] that blessing said you claim that for
[1:17:04] yourself a lot of people claim that a
[1:17:06] lot of great things but I want you to
[1:17:09] understand when he prayed that our
[1:17:12] business for us me Andrew and dad was in
[1:17:17] disarray total chaos worst year that
[1:17:20] we've ever had in business since the
[1:17:22] recession worst year
[1:17:25] I was looking for a job as a police
[1:17:26] officer or Sheriff depy I was making
[1:17:30] calls but I claimed that blessing I want
[1:17:33] you to understand the
[1:17:36] opportunity that was
[1:17:38] coming I had to be looking for it I was
[1:17:42] praying about it Lord you're going to
[1:17:44] have to provide me with an opportunity
[1:17:46] to provide for my family I was willing
[1:17:48] to get out and do whatever I needed to
[1:17:50] do amen no matter what it was I was
[1:17:54] willing to get out and do it so we went
[1:17:57] to Brother Tim Pit's church for his fall
[1:18:00] meetings there meetings were going on
[1:18:03] after the meetings we went to uh brother
[1:18:06] Joe Adams house and we was just talking
[1:18:08] there and he was explaining a lot of the
[1:18:10] other uh converter guys and recycle
[1:18:13] people that they know were in the same
[1:18:15] boat as that we were in and he said you
[1:18:18] know I'm just praying the Lord Brother
[1:18:19] bless her and uh hey we was too amen but
[1:18:24] then brother Joe said I don't know if
[1:18:26] this would be something you're
[1:18:27] interested in he's like but we bought
[1:18:30] two dump trailers he's like and we're
[1:18:32] just renting them out a week and you
[1:18:34] know y'all got the trucks already maybe
[1:18:36] you could do something like that get a
[1:18:38] little extra money on the
[1:18:39] side so the opportunity now presented
[1:18:44] itself okay I was willing to do whatever
[1:18:47] the Lord had upon me to do you
[1:18:51] understand so the opportunity presented
[1:18:54] itself
[1:18:55] I called Andrew I said hey why
[1:18:59] not we have no nothing to lose here
[1:19:03] nothing to lose we ain't making no money
[1:19:04] we ain't been paid in over three months
[1:19:07] so what have we got to lose we was
[1:19:10] looking and doing scratching digging
[1:19:11] ping whatever we had to
[1:19:13] do so I said why not so the opportunity
[1:19:18] presented
[1:19:19] itself now for the past 3
[1:19:22] weeks we have done dumpsters dump
[1:19:25] trailers and every single one of them
[1:19:27] are booked
[1:19:28] out past 3 weeks this week they're
[1:19:31] booked out as
[1:19:33] well hey and more is on the
[1:19:37] way so the opportunity is laying there
[1:19:41] in times but you have to be willing
[1:19:43] sometimes to step into it and you don't
[1:19:46] know what you're going to have to do
[1:19:47] right amen some people you know I tell
[1:19:51] Andrew and them all the time I pray that
[1:19:53] the Lord provides me with the wealth to
[1:19:56] be able to buy
[1:19:57] land so when the opportunity for the
[1:20:00] land that I'm wanting to buy comes up I
[1:20:03] have been praying for it so when it
[1:20:05] comes available I'm going to buy it amen
[1:20:09] I'm not going to sit around and say well
[1:20:12] Lord you know I have been praying about
[1:20:15] this and you have provided me with the
[1:20:18] funds to do
[1:20:19] this and it's available but Lord only
[1:20:23] you know if I really should step into
[1:20:25] this
[1:20:26] opportunity it's there it's like the
[1:20:29] woman on the roof when the flood's
[1:20:31] coming and the boat comes by three times
[1:20:34] get on the boat I I mean what do you
[1:20:38] have to
[1:20:45] do she got to heaven and the Lord said
[1:20:48] why why didn't you get on the boat said
[1:20:50] Lord I was praying for you to come down
[1:20:52] and save me he said I I sent three boats
[1:20:57] so sometimes you when you're praying
[1:21:00] about it and it comes hey go for it
[1:21:03] opportunity arises go for it amen so
[1:21:07] that was the first lesson of Nehemiah
[1:21:09] the opportunity is now come so what are
[1:21:12] you going to do about
[1:21:16] this so he comes before the king now as
[1:21:20] the cup Bearer he's saddened he's come
[1:21:23] before the king and and he satad and and
[1:21:26] the King and his Queen asked him why are
[1:21:29] you so sad what is wrong you've never
[1:21:32] come before us like this before what is
[1:21:35] wrong and he said why shouldn't I be sad
[1:21:37] when my people was in disarray the walls
[1:21:40] are not built the temple was there they
[1:21:43] can sacrifice they can go in but the the
[1:21:46] temple was there ezar Ezra built the
[1:21:49] temple but the walls thereof are in
[1:21:51] rubbish there there's no walls to
[1:21:54] protect them there is no City thereof so
[1:21:57] he now has the ability to explain to
[1:22:01] someone that he has been taught under
[1:22:04] because Nehemiah just didn't sit there
[1:22:06] and
[1:22:07] just act like he he's just a flly on a
[1:22:10] wall or whatever he learned from the
[1:22:13] King he become a leader and that's the
[1:22:17] way we grow in life a lot of times we
[1:22:19] don't know what we're going to be but as
[1:22:21] you're growing up you're going to learn
[1:22:23] things you're going to learn traits
[1:22:25] every single one of us are different
[1:22:27] amen every not all of us are carpenters
[1:22:30] brother Terry Klein built a beautiful
[1:22:32] log little miniature Log Cabin the other
[1:22:34] day I can't do that with Lincoln
[1:22:39] Logs that's not me we are all built
[1:22:42] differently so God he puts us in certain
[1:22:46] places and certain times that when the
[1:22:48] opportunity comes to help somebody
[1:22:51] you're able to do it amen
[1:22:55] and so they're asking him why are you so
[1:22:57] sad and so he explains to him about the
[1:23:01] city and the walls
[1:23:03] thereof and so they asked so what what
[1:23:07] can we do so he prayed again said Lord
[1:23:11] give me the guidance to get the request
[1:23:14] right right he prayed again Nehemiah
[1:23:18] prayed 11 times here in the book of
[1:23:21] Nehemiah prayer
[1:23:24] and said so I prayed unto the god of
[1:23:26] heaven and I said unto the king if it
[1:23:28] would please the king and If thy servant
[1:23:32] hath found favor in thy sight thou would
[1:23:35] as send me to Judah unto the city of my
[1:23:37] father's supper that I may build it so
[1:23:41] he's now he he's presenting it to the
[1:23:43] king now and the King said unto me the
[1:23:48] queen also sitting by him for how long
[1:23:51] shall thou make thy journey be they were
[1:23:53] concerned that he wouldn't come back
[1:23:56] they loved Nehemiah that much they were
[1:23:59] concerned he wouldn't come back so they
[1:24:01] said how long will thou be and wilt thou
[1:24:05] return so it pleased the king to send me
[1:24:08] so he gave him an
[1:24:10] answer didn't really
[1:24:13] say but it pleased the king maybe he'll
[1:24:16] come back maybe hey it pleased
[1:24:20] him to send me and I set a time
[1:24:25] but we don't know that time but he had
[1:24:27] set a time for him
[1:24:29] there so what happens next is what we
[1:24:34] want to term as now Nehemiah is placed
[1:24:37] into a leadership
[1:24:39] role he he is now placed into a role of
[1:24:42] leadership but before he could do this
[1:24:47] he then had to learn
[1:24:48] negotiations he had to negotiate with
[1:24:51] the king and queen to be able to go do
[1:24:53] this
[1:24:54] so to be able to ask something from
[1:24:57] other people you need to learn to
[1:24:59] negotiate you need to learn what am I
[1:25:02] providing to this person that is giving
[1:25:06] them and making them better that they
[1:25:08] would help me amen so we have a lot of
[1:25:12] camp meetings a lot of um youth camps
[1:25:16] that are going on but as youth you're
[1:25:19] going to have to work and if you come
[1:25:22] before your boss and you're you every
[1:25:25] single time a youth camp comes around
[1:25:26] you go boss this is for the Lord this is
[1:25:30] for the Lord that I'm
[1:25:31] going well boss man don't know what's
[1:25:34] for the Lord there boss man only
[1:25:37] understands that if you ain't working he
[1:25:41] ain't making
[1:25:42] money do do you understand that did if
[1:25:46] if you ain't working he ain't making
[1:25:48] money so what what service are you
[1:25:51] providing him to negotiate that you can
[1:25:53] now go
[1:25:55] so so if there is a deadline that has to
[1:25:57] be met and he says no hey understand
[1:26:02] you're not providing something that he
[1:26:03] just can't go find then y'all I got
[1:26:06] plenty of money the business will
[1:26:08] survive if if they can work without
[1:26:12] you you might not be there very
[1:26:15] long when you leave and things still run
[1:26:19] smooth smoothly or
[1:26:22] smoother you might not be there very
[1:26:25] long so we see Nehemiah he negotiated a
[1:26:29] time that he was going to come back and
[1:26:32] they wanted him to come back they did
[1:26:34] not want him to leave amen so leadership
[1:26:37] what is your skill what what are you
[1:26:40] providing what what do you have laying
[1:26:43] on the inside of you every single we got
[1:26:46] a lot of our youth sitting up here and
[1:26:47] some of them's there in Tennessee but
[1:26:50] find your skill in life okay amen find
[1:26:54] what you are built for okay ask your mom
[1:26:58] and dad what do I do well do you think
[1:27:02] that I would succeed in life not
[1:27:05] everybody is going to be a speaker not
[1:27:07] everybody is going to be a carpenter not
[1:27:09] everybody's going to be a
[1:27:11] doctor but if you like doing certain
[1:27:13] little things then you can go about that
[1:27:17] and find what you're to do in life
[1:27:21] amen you know we was talking about it
[1:27:23] this week it's an incredible testimony
[1:27:25] of brother Aiden H and the garden there
[1:27:29] that they they
[1:27:31] started when they came to Dad they had
[1:27:34] just come out of a a bad
[1:27:36] situation shirt on their backs and some
[1:27:39] of you know the stories and I'm going to
[1:27:41] explain everything but when Dad was
[1:27:44] praying he just asked what's your
[1:27:48] hobby what do you like to
[1:27:51] do and he said flowers
[1:27:55] so you take at that moment what he was
[1:27:59] doing well what he could do well now it
[1:28:02] didn't just become a
[1:28:05] multiun Acre Farm overnight he didn't go
[1:28:08] to the bank and say hey the vision is
[1:28:10] this here there's going to be people
[1:28:12] come from all over the US I'm going to
[1:28:14] sell flowers everywhere and they saying
[1:28:18] go for it do it he had to set up a
[1:28:22] little shop probably somewhere and just
[1:28:23] start start little to get to where he
[1:28:26] needed to be and that's the way some of
[1:28:28] us have to do sometimes it's not going
[1:28:31] to be overnight it's not going to be
[1:28:34] instantaneous we got prodal that are
[1:28:36] coming in they're not all going to look
[1:28:39] like brother Roy and sister Darlene over
[1:28:41] here overnight I I mean Angels on the
[1:28:44] earth you know there amen so when those
[1:28:48] protocals come in it's going to take a
[1:28:51] little time so you bear with what
[1:28:54] they're learning and what they're
[1:28:55] providing to us as a
[1:28:58] congregation amen because they are the
[1:29:00] next pillars of this church if the Lord
[1:29:04] should car they're the pillars of what
[1:29:06] this church is going to be built on
[1:29:08] [Applause]
[1:29:17] Amen
[1:29:19] so he then asked for the king says
[1:29:22] moreover said to the king if it would
[1:29:24] please the king let letters be given
[1:29:26] unto me to the governors beyond the
[1:29:28] river that I may convey me over till I
[1:29:33] come to Judah he's he's granting he's
[1:29:35] given him passes to get there and letter
[1:29:40] unto Esa okay The Keeper of the king's
[1:29:45] Forest that he may be given the timber
[1:29:47] to make the beams for the gates and the
[1:29:51] palace which apparently
[1:29:55] a one of y'all to the house for the wall
[1:29:59] of the city for the house that I shall
[1:30:02] enter into and the King granted me
[1:30:05] according to my good hand and my God
[1:30:08] upon
[1:30:09] me people are seeing something in you
[1:30:12] that's different oh yeah there is times
[1:30:16] that you're going to be lifted up in
[1:30:19] your position and people around you have
[1:30:21] been doing what you've been doing for
[1:30:23] years
[1:30:24] and you're lifted up and they stay where
[1:30:26] they're at but it's what's God's doing
[1:30:29] in
[1:30:30] you there is a light that is following
[1:30:33] you there's something on the inside that
[1:30:35] God is producing and helping you to be
[1:30:37] where you're
[1:30:39] at so he granted him all of these
[1:30:43] things Nehemiah couldn't just go to
[1:30:46] Jerusalem and the people there and say
[1:30:50] I'm
[1:30:51] here I'm Your Leader yeah this is what
[1:30:54] we're going to do you go over there and
[1:30:57] build he had to be given the tools and
[1:31:01] the materials to help build it so what
[1:31:04] did he do he was able to do this and it
[1:31:06] was able to encourage them to produce
[1:31:09] what they was trying to do they was
[1:31:11] trying to build a wall so he went and
[1:31:14] did this but in the next couple verses
[1:31:17] as he's going over to see these walls he
[1:31:22] don't go in the middle of the day
[1:31:24] he don't go and have a great Caravan and
[1:31:28] everybody's blowing their trumpets and
[1:31:29] everything else he is going in the
[1:31:31] middle of the night to see what is going
[1:31:34] on with the walls what has to be done so
[1:31:39] in our
[1:31:40] lives we have to do some things in the
[1:31:43] private am in private times to create
[1:31:47] the better goal amen he went in the
[1:31:51] secret of the night to see what was
[1:31:53] going on
[1:31:54] he went to
[1:31:56] inspect amen there's times in our prayer
[1:31:59] life we don't want Satan to know what's
[1:32:01] going to happen next cuz there's times
[1:32:05] hey we don't even know but when you're
[1:32:07] in that time that you need to go for
[1:32:10] inspection and you need to come before
[1:32:12] the Lord and say this is what's going on
[1:32:15] a private matter in the middle of the
[1:32:17] night he went to do this inspection of
[1:32:20] the
[1:32:21] wall so as a leader there's
[1:32:25] sometimes there has to be some
[1:32:27] inspections done some of you have seen
[1:32:29] Undercover Boss and the boss would come
[1:32:31] in and and there's some good workers
[1:32:35] there's some that are
[1:32:38] sorry and when it's done and said the
[1:32:41] ones that were good they keep or promote
[1:32:45] but the ones that were bad
[1:32:47] bad move on so Nehemiah went as a leader
[1:32:52] to inspect what's going on what's being
[1:32:55] done about this who's going to help
[1:32:59] me who who is around willing to stand
[1:33:04] with me to get this
[1:33:07] accomplished in the middle of the night
[1:33:10] what are they doing maybe he walked up
[1:33:12] to a window or somewhere where somebody
[1:33:15] was camping and they was praying God you
[1:33:19] know what I have need of at this moment
[1:33:22] you know we're in Desolation but Lord
[1:33:24] please send your
[1:33:26] answer and maybe he seen that and he
[1:33:29] said that one can help me that one right
[1:33:33] there is going to be one of my
[1:33:35] pillars amen amen so he went for
[1:33:38] inspection to view what was going
[1:33:42] on but you see as you come down a little
[1:33:44] bit
[1:33:45] further you run into
[1:33:49] opposition so we run
[1:33:51] into let's go to NE IAH 217 says then I
[1:33:56] said unto them Yay see the distress that
[1:33:59] they are in how Jerusalem iath in waste
[1:34:02] the gates thereof are burned with fire
[1:34:05] come and let us build the wall of
[1:34:07] Jerusalem that we will no more be a
[1:34:11] reproach he's telling them now hey we're
[1:34:14] no longer going to be a reproach to God
[1:34:17] Amen this is what we're going to do I
[1:34:19] have the materials y'all have the
[1:34:21] knowhow we're going to be able to do
[1:34:23] this
[1:34:24] then I told them of the good hand of my
[1:34:27] God see God was with him on this
[1:34:30] situation which was good upon me and
[1:34:34] also the king's words that they had
[1:34:36] spoken unto me and said let us arise let
[1:34:40] us rise up and
[1:34:41] build so they strengthen their hands for
[1:34:45] this good work but I want you to see
[1:34:48] when you go to do when you go to start
[1:34:50] doing something good what happens
[1:34:53] opposition is on its way anytime that
[1:34:57] you go do any good for anybody
[1:35:00] somebody's going to
[1:35:01] complain it's just the way it is so we
[1:35:05] see here in uh verse 19 says but then s
[1:35:08] ballot The Hornet Knight to buth the
[1:35:10] servant the ammonite and Gish the
[1:35:14] araban I didn't say that correctly but
[1:35:18] heard it and they laughed us to scorn
[1:35:20] and despised us and said what is this
[1:35:23] thing that ye do will you Rebel Rebel
[1:35:26] Against The King and I answered them and
[1:35:29] said unto them God Of Heaven he will
[1:35:33] prosper us therefore his servants will
[1:35:36] arise and build but ye have no portion
[1:35:40] nor right nor Memorial in Jerusalem this
[1:35:43] ain't for you that's right he was
[1:35:45] telling them this ain't for y'all I I I
[1:35:48] don't understand why y'all don't
[1:35:49] understand this but this ain't for you
[1:35:52] there's some people that it is not for
[1:35:54] the message is not for that's right but
[1:35:57] they will laugh you to scorn they will
[1:35:59] make fun of you family members will make
[1:36:02] fun of you and say and they would rather
[1:36:05] you be in the world be drunk be high be
[1:36:08] a bum than to be a Christian to live a
[1:36:12] Christlike life set in a church they
[1:36:14] would much rather you go do that because
[1:36:17] it helps them feel
[1:36:20] better the city was in rubbish the city
[1:36:23] s ruins and they're making fun of them
[1:36:25] for actually going about and doing
[1:36:27] something so you are going to have
[1:36:29] people in your life that going to oppose
[1:36:31] everything you do if you're a leader
[1:36:34] you're a leader of your children you're
[1:36:36] a leader of your household there's going
[1:36:37] to be people that will judge you on how
[1:36:39] you're doing it no matter how good of a
[1:36:42] job that you are doing there's going to
[1:36:43] be people that'll judge you right no
[1:36:46] matter what you're doing in life there
[1:36:48] will be people say well he should have
[1:36:49] done it that
[1:36:51] way I don't know how many times dad has
[1:36:54] counseled with people and given them the
[1:36:56] correct counsel and they go do the
[1:36:58] complete opposite of what he says it's
[1:37:02] amazing it is amazing granddaddy Homer
[1:37:05] he had a lot of them he he said I have I
[1:37:09] have some family members not any sitting
[1:37:11] here he said I'd tell them what to do
[1:37:13] you know they how how do I make a little
[1:37:15] money I'd tell them what to do he said
[1:37:17] they wouldn't listen to a
[1:37:18] thing opposition because they always
[1:37:21] want to do it better they think they can
[1:37:23] do do it better but they' not been
[1:37:24] provided with the tools and the access
[1:37:26] to be able to do it but this was not for
[1:37:29] them it was for the children of Israel
[1:37:31] the Jews
[1:37:34] there so we move on into chapter three
[1:37:38] and chapter three is a lot of names and
[1:37:40] a lot of things that will
[1:37:43] be who did what in the building of the
[1:37:47] wall thereof because Nehemiah could not
[1:37:50] do it by
[1:37:51] himself amen
[1:37:54] in John 10:27 says my sheep hear my
[1:37:58] voice and I know them and they will
[1:38:01] follow me so he brought them to a place
[1:38:05] brought neiah to a place with a purpose
[1:38:09] and God was leading them the whole way
[1:38:12] because the people had to be led sheep
[1:38:16] has to be
[1:38:17] led amen amen
[1:38:25] in Romans 8:14 it says for as many that
[1:38:28] are led by the spirit of God are called
[1:38:31] sons of
[1:38:32] God Amen so as I was just saying there
[1:38:37] was an
[1:38:38] opposition if there is a true there's
[1:38:40] going to be a
[1:38:41] false if there is a bride there's going
[1:38:44] to be ones that aren't elected amen if
[1:38:47] there is a people that will worship
[1:38:49] there's a people that won't worship amen
[1:38:52] there's a people people that won't read
[1:38:54] the word there's a people that love the
[1:38:56] word amen there's going to be people
[1:38:59] that are going to put their hands to the
[1:39:01] work of what the Lord is doing in the
[1:39:03] church
[1:39:05] amen so understand that there's going to
[1:39:08] be some that ain't going to do a
[1:39:10] thing but in chapter three I want to S
[1:39:13] show you here what's the first thing
[1:39:15] that is built and then Elias the high
[1:39:19] priest rose up who was it it was the
[1:39:22] high priest rose up the leaders there in
[1:39:25] that City Rose up with his Brethren the
[1:39:28] priest and they build it the Sheep gate
[1:39:31] what was the Sheep gate the Sheep gate
[1:39:34] was the gate to go into the temple to
[1:39:37] worship what's the first thing they did
[1:39:39] the high priest the leaders of the
[1:39:41] church what's the first thing they're
[1:39:42] going to do they're going to create
[1:39:44] worship because God loves worship
[1:39:47] worship is the first thing that's being
[1:39:49] built on the wall the first thing we
[1:39:51] come into church what's the first thing
[1:39:52] we do we worship amen we break the
[1:39:55] ground there's some hard ground that
[1:39:57] comes in here but we break it up we
[1:40:00] break up that hard spirit that you have
[1:40:02] to go through through the week and says
[1:40:04] Lord I'm here just do something well
[1:40:05] what's the song leader doing he's
[1:40:07] starting to grind that ground he's
[1:40:09] starting to get it ready for seed to be
[1:40:11] able to drop in so the first thing that
[1:40:14] the high priest did was create worship
[1:40:18] worship where can we go we can go to
[1:40:20] worship the first thing that they did
[1:40:22] was worship worship amen Give the Lord a
[1:40:25] hand for worship this morning cuz he
[1:40:28] loves
[1:40:35] worship but they didn't just build it
[1:40:38] they Sanctified it they set up the doors
[1:40:40] of it and even made the Tower of
[1:40:44] menth and Sanctified it unto the Tower
[1:40:46] of
[1:40:47] hanani so we go on and we see there is a
[1:40:51] lot of places in here and a lot of
[1:40:55] people that are
[1:40:57] building come down to verse 5 I want you
[1:41:00] to understand in verse 5 and it says
[1:41:03] next unto them the techit repaired but
[1:41:07] their nobles put not their necks to the
[1:41:09] work of the
[1:41:11] Lord they was willing to do the work but
[1:41:14] the Elder Nobles didn't want to do a
[1:41:17] thing if you if you find some people
[1:41:20] that don't want to just do a thing hey
[1:41:23] you you just keep doing your work that's
[1:41:24] right but also you go from verse 5 over
[1:41:29] into verse 27 and what does verse 27
[1:41:32] says and after them the teom mites
[1:41:36] repaired another piece over against the
[1:41:39] great tower that lith
[1:41:43] out even unto the wall of
[1:41:48] ill they built two different pieces they
[1:41:51] they didn't just stop at one
[1:41:54] they had a passion for what was being
[1:41:58] done they they did more than their fair
[1:42:01] share that's right and you're going to
[1:42:02] come to church sometimes and there is
[1:42:04] people that are sitting there that is
[1:42:06] going to do more than their fair share
[1:42:08] of
[1:42:09] worship amen because there's some that
[1:42:11] ain't going to do a thing there's some
[1:42:13] that's going to sit there and
[1:42:15] say I'm
[1:42:18] here help
[1:42:21] me I'm here
[1:42:24] but there's some that are saying what
[1:42:27] has to be
[1:42:29] done what what do you need done around
[1:42:32] here brother Homer had a saying said if
[1:42:35] you see it and it ain't done and you
[1:42:36] want to do it do it do it you ain't got
[1:42:39] to come ask me he'd say do
[1:42:43] it I if there's some weeds or something
[1:42:45] that needs to be done don't don't ask
[1:42:47] brother Adam Hey Brother Adam thank you
[1:42:49] for doing all you do but there's some
[1:42:50] weeds over here go pick them
[1:42:54] then then you don't have to go get him
[1:42:55] go show them that hey here they are bend
[1:42:58] your back over and pull them
[1:43:01] up there there's a group of men that
[1:43:03] come here and shovel snow every winter
[1:43:06] and if you want to come and it snows
[1:43:07] call the pastor call the leaders we're
[1:43:10] here first thing we're we're going to be
[1:43:12] able to create a place you can come and
[1:43:15] worship
[1:43:17] amen but there's people that are going
[1:43:19] to do more than their fair share and be
[1:43:21] willing to do it and not not ask a thing
[1:43:23] for it and that's the thing about
[1:43:26] leaders they are going to do stuff to
[1:43:28] help encourage other people and not ask
[1:43:30] a thing for
[1:43:32] it cuz that's what a leader does a
[1:43:35] leader is going to improve your life not
[1:43:38] always improve his he's going to make
[1:43:40] sure your life is better improve what
[1:43:42] you got amen
[1:43:46] improve so we see they did more than
[1:43:48] their fair share of the work and they
[1:43:52] and it comes down
[1:43:53] and y'all can go back and read all these
[1:43:55] or listen to it that's what I had to do
[1:43:57] because the names
[1:44:00] thereof so there is a lot of people that
[1:44:02] go about and do a lot of
[1:44:05] things and do parts of the walls and
[1:44:09] then there's
[1:44:10] some and says in verse 10 it says next
[1:44:13] unto them
[1:44:14] repaired jedii the son of
[1:44:20] har I am sorry I am not good with names
[1:44:24] as a police officer I was not good with
[1:44:26] names tell me your name again and I'd
[1:44:28] look at
[1:44:29] it I don't
[1:44:34] know even over against his house
[1:44:39] so y'all have it up there yes so they
[1:44:43] did the work that was convenient for
[1:44:48] them beside their house
[1:44:53] you can go down the road an hour and get
[1:44:56] food or you can drive 10 minutes and get
[1:44:59] fooled that's right amen so you can go
[1:45:02] to the church where you're going to get
[1:45:04] food or go to a denomination and get
[1:45:08] fooled so what you willing to do what
[1:45:12] what what what's going to you know a lot
[1:45:14] of people what is it going to help
[1:45:16] me you got to stop looking at it that
[1:45:19] way that's right it it is hard to get
[1:45:22] people but at least they did something
[1:45:25] they did something beside their own
[1:45:27] house because it was convenient for them
[1:45:30] and then there's jobs in the church as a
[1:45:34] leader that you know is a bad job you
[1:45:37] know that there's only one man that'll
[1:45:41] do the job and so you come to the wall
[1:45:44] of the dung gate yeah it wasn't the
[1:45:49] tower there's a lot of people want to
[1:45:51] help build the Tower
[1:45:53] there's a lot of people want to be there
[1:45:55] when you're doing the great work and all
[1:45:57] of it and hey let me help out what can I
[1:46:00] do and you know but there's very little
[1:46:03] that want to help with the dung gate
[1:46:05] there's very little want to help get
[1:46:07] down in the
[1:46:08] nitty-gritty and do stuff me and
[1:46:12] Dad we get down to nitty-gritty a lot of
[1:46:15] times we we get down in situations that
[1:46:18] are just you wouldn't want to be a part
[1:46:21] of it amen it it's
[1:46:24] bad Grandad Homer has in a lot of
[1:46:29] situations a certain cow got stuck in a
[1:46:31] Cellar he didn't get out and they didn't
[1:46:34] know about
[1:46:35] it we got down we had to clean out the
[1:46:38] Sellar so there was only two
[1:46:41] people that could have handled it
[1:46:45] because God built us that way he let's
[1:46:48] just say it like
[1:46:51] that that can handle Andrew he said I
[1:46:53] I'm out
[1:46:55] boys I'm out I always had a weak
[1:47:01] stomach but it had need to be built the
[1:47:05] dung gate right why sanitation where you
[1:47:09] going to go use a restroom where things
[1:47:11] where's waste going to go out of it had
[1:47:13] to be
[1:47:15] built it wasn't pretty
[1:47:18] it it ain't pretty all the time but
[1:47:22] sometimes when the Lord call you to do a
[1:47:24] purpose in your life you might go dear
[1:47:28] Lord why are you sending me to do this
[1:47:32] because the Lord built you to do that
[1:47:35] that's right amen not all of us are
[1:47:37] doctors not all of us are lawyers some
[1:47:40] of us are sanitizers amen sanitary field
[1:47:44] I I haul trash now for
[1:47:46] 11 I mean the Lord provided us a way and
[1:47:50] I wasn't scared to do it there's times
[1:47:52] you get out of the car get out in the
[1:47:54] truck and you take your boots off before
[1:47:56] you get back in the truck because it
[1:47:58] wasn't pretty out
[1:48:00] there so the people that did this their
[1:48:04] blessing might be greater because of the
[1:48:06] people that was building the tower say
[1:48:08] hey thank you thank you thank you
[1:48:11] because of what you
[1:48:13] done so God's chosen us for a certain
[1:48:16] purpose in our lives and so he will lead
[1:48:19] you to be able to do each and every one
[1:48:20] of those purposes amen and I want you to
[1:48:23] see here in verse
[1:48:26] 20 barck the son of Ze zei earnestly
[1:48:33] repaired the other piece there's a lot
[1:48:36] of people in a lot of places that's
[1:48:37] being built here understand this and
[1:48:39] chapter three is a hard one to go
[1:48:41] through
[1:48:42] but understand he did his job
[1:48:46] earnestly earnestly there's people that
[1:48:49] are coming come in through those doors
[1:48:51] and they're going to do what ever needs
[1:48:53] to be done and earnestly do it earnestly
[1:48:56] do it who was the gentleman that used to
[1:48:58] come up here s on the front row and he'd
[1:49:00] sing i' said I'd never make
[1:49:02] it Harold
[1:49:04] Blair earnestly come into the temple
[1:49:08] Hallelujah earnestly did his part
[1:49:11] earnestly during preaching would sit
[1:49:13] there and hum and sing
[1:49:16] earnestly yeah and he'd sat there and
[1:49:19] Granddaddy and Dad preach
[1:49:23] oh you said I'd never last said I'd
[1:49:26] never get away with all the sins of my
[1:49:30] past I'm still far from perfect you can
[1:49:33] plainly
[1:49:34] see and after all these years go by lord
[1:49:38] it's still you and
[1:49:41] me and he'd sing that earnestly every
[1:49:44] time and there'd be times that he'd come
[1:49:45] into church he'd run down the aisle run
[1:49:47] up through here run across through there
[1:49:49] and you go what in the world
[1:49:55] granddaddy ain't even sing just before
[1:49:57] heaven doors closed
[1:50:00] yet but he was ready to
[1:50:02] worship
[1:50:04] amen he was earnestly ready to do what
[1:50:07] needed to be
[1:50:09] done but you come down a little further
[1:50:11] and you see there's another one that
[1:50:14] built over against his
[1:50:16] house it's all right it's all right
[1:50:19] they're not going to always move at
[1:50:21] their Pew they might just stand there
[1:50:23] and say thank you Lord and you just say
[1:50:25] thank you Lord for put them here to pay
[1:50:28] the light
[1:50:31] bill so just understand that not always
[1:50:34] are you going to get people earnestly
[1:50:35] ready to worship amen as a worship
[1:50:38] leader I completely earnestly
[1:50:45] understand amen so let's move on from
[1:50:48] chapter three now so I think we've done
[1:50:50] a pretty good work here hallelujah time
[1:50:52] flying y'all enjoying it ain't
[1:51:03] you so you go through chapter three and
[1:51:06] you come down to more opposition and
[1:51:08] more reticle reticule by some B some
[1:51:14] ballot heard that the wall had build and
[1:51:18] he was rough and took great indignation
[1:51:20] and mocked the Jews there you go go
[1:51:22] again more mockings more scorning more
[1:51:25] you ain't going to do nothing even Toth
[1:51:28] the ammonite in chap in verse three of
[1:51:31] chapter 4
[1:51:33] says said even that which they build a
[1:51:37] fox could go up and even break down the
[1:51:39] stone wall that's making
[1:51:43] fun what is this paper mâché
[1:51:46] yeah what you've done a fox could tear
[1:51:49] down it can you believe that so they met
[1:51:53] more
[1:51:54] opposition but the people had a mind to
[1:51:59] work they had a mind to do the Lord's
[1:52:03] work they kept doing what they needed to
[1:52:06] do to get it done but you see what they
[1:52:10] they come upon an adversary that did not
[1:52:13] want the wall to be built and it wasn't
[1:52:16] even for them it wasn't even for
[1:52:19] them so what happened is is while they
[1:52:23] was building the
[1:52:24] wall they'd
[1:52:27] work I brought this from more of the the
[1:52:29] kids cuz they'll remember this more than
[1:52:32] anything I said tonight Hallelujah so so
[1:52:36] they worked they built a wall and they
[1:52:38] did a just a fine job I mean this my
[1:52:42] part was beautiful and they'd come
[1:52:45] down they did a good job boom
[1:52:48] boom they'd stand back and look at it
[1:52:51] but now they're starting to get scorn
[1:52:53] and ridicule and say fox can tear that
[1:52:55] down what you just built Fox carar that
[1:52:58] down so they
[1:53:01] then this is a
[1:53:04] trial
[1:53:07] trial but we're going to call it a
[1:53:10] trio and so their Trio started to get
[1:53:15] heavy on
[1:53:17] them Lord you know I did a good job
[1:53:21] they're making fun of me
[1:53:24] and W he W he
[1:53:27] woo brother jeul forny would say w he
[1:53:32] W you know I can't praise the Lord this
[1:53:35] weekend it's been a tough
[1:53:38] day I tried to do a work for the Lord
[1:53:41] but it did it
[1:53:43] tough and they here's my trial carried
[1:53:47] around my
[1:53:49] trial I I wish I could have done a
[1:53:51] better job but there making fun of me
[1:53:53] now
[1:53:54] for so Nehemiah had to come along and
[1:53:58] pray
[1:54:00] again what he'd get down behind the wall
[1:54:03] with him he prayed he saying what are
[1:54:06] y'all going to do about
[1:54:08] this yeah there is opposition but the
[1:54:11] lord gave us the
[1:54:13] work so with your
[1:54:16] trial go do something about
[1:54:19] it stand up with what the Lord granted
[1:54:22] you with the ability to do it and work
[1:54:25] with it right amen your trial may help
[1:54:29] somebody else in life right so they came
[1:54:33] and did more of the
[1:54:35] work and more opposition come and more
[1:54:38] adversary and Sam ballot and all of them
[1:54:41] they started to go in amongst them
[1:54:43] that's the best way to do it start
[1:54:45] gossip start and then
[1:54:48] jealousy and they started creating all
[1:54:50] these things and here they were and they
[1:54:51] get their trial and then they come
[1:54:54] back they said that about
[1:54:57] me D old Fox could go up and tear down
[1:54:59] the
[1:55:01] wall there's my trial no take it go do
[1:55:04] something with it amen go go go finish
[1:55:08] your part of the Wall go do it and so
[1:55:10] they continued to come on more
[1:55:12] adversaries and more armies started come
[1:55:13] on so they had to take up arms they had
[1:55:17] to start doing something more than
[1:55:20] just work with their Tri Tri they had to
[1:55:23] get some
[1:55:25] weapons amen they had to get
[1:55:29] something that to hold them
[1:55:36] off y'all like
[1:55:40] that first time I I preached what is in
[1:55:42] thy hand amen using Moses uh shamard and
[1:55:46] all of them I had brother metas he was
[1:55:48] sitting right up here and I had him hold
[1:55:50] he had my back
[1:55:52] and he still got my back amen he's a
[1:55:55] pillar he's got my back and as I work
[1:55:58] the wall amen give me my
[1:56:06] hand and as I work the wall I was
[1:56:09] building up something I said brother M
[1:56:11] you got my back I know you do and he'd
[1:56:12] sat there and he held that thing up the
[1:56:15] rest of that service there for a little
[1:56:16] while he'd Hold That Thing Up I knew he
[1:56:19] had my
[1:56:20] back because I was having to do a work
[1:56:24] and I had somebody that would have my
[1:56:26] back
[1:56:28] Hallelujah there's some young men
[1:56:29] sitting here young ladies sitting here I
[1:56:33] got to know that they're going to have
[1:56:34] my
[1:56:35] back amen I'm going to use brother
[1:56:38] Nathan here yeah brother Nathan is now
[1:56:41] going to have my back because brother
[1:56:45] metas he's a pillar but now his work is
[1:56:50] to be able to encourage brother Nathan
[1:56:52] so when he says hallelujah amen to the
[1:56:55] word it's encouraging brother Nathan to
[1:56:57] know that hey I'm a pillar now I'm going
[1:57:01] to stand when nobody else
[1:57:04] stands brother Matthew I got your
[1:57:07] back so I have to trust him while I'm
[1:57:10] doing a work and I got to make sure that
[1:57:14] this gets done and I got to know that
[1:57:17] without a shadow of a doubt he's got my
[1:57:20] back
[1:57:22] right because there's
[1:57:24] times that I might not know what's going
[1:57:26] on as a leader as a leader as a worker
[1:57:29] in the church you might not always get
[1:57:32] every single detail of the situation
[1:57:34] that's right you hear a lot of stuff
[1:57:37] secondhand and you want to give an
[1:57:39] opinion but you don't know always the
[1:57:41] situation so you have to have people
[1:57:44] that will have your back no matter what
[1:57:47] in
[1:57:48] life so I know without a shadow a doubt
[1:57:53] while I'm doing the work and I won't
[1:57:56] come down he's back here with me he's
[1:57:59] going to praise a little bit for me he's
[1:58:01] going to worship a little bit for me
[1:58:04] he's going to get down in the gutter
[1:58:05] with me sometimes oh yeah and we're
[1:58:08] going to come through we're going to be
[1:58:10] Overcomers but there's going to come
[1:58:12] sometimes that the adversary is so great
[1:58:15] that you have to take your trial and
[1:58:17] your work and the word of the Lord sword
[1:58:21] of the spirit
[1:58:22] amen he gave you tools of warfare for a
[1:58:25] reason
[1:58:29] amen my mind went blank shamgar took
[1:58:34] what was in his hand to whip the enemy
[1:58:37] to whip the Philistine Philistines had
[1:58:39] come upon him so there's times that
[1:58:42] you're going to have to do the work of
[1:58:43] the Lord you're going to have to work
[1:58:45] and you're going to have to fight you're
[1:58:47] going to have to stop the opposition
[1:58:50] that is coming against you that is
[1:58:52] coming against your family you're going
[1:58:54] to have to be a leader of your home and
[1:58:56] you're going to have to continue the
[1:58:58] work but continue the
[1:59:01] fight that's what we're here to do we're
[1:59:04] here to continue the fight there
[1:59:06] on so y'all are going to have to be
[1:59:09] leaders in this last day drawing people
[1:59:12] to the word because we don't know who's
[1:59:15] going to be in the city when it's all
[1:59:17] said and
[1:59:19] done no man knoweth the number no man
[1:59:22] knoweth the day
[1:59:23] thereof as I was explaining earlier the
[1:59:26] days and the years and then we could
[1:59:27] count down but no man know when he
[1:59:29] cometh because he's going to come as a
[1:59:30] thief in the
[1:59:32] night so there's going to be times that
[1:59:34] you have to do a work and you're going
[1:59:36] to have to create a little
[1:59:39] Warfare he God didn't call sissies God
[1:59:42] called men and women to stand up for
[1:59:45] what is right in this last
[1:59:48] day when there's men and women that will
[1:59:51] just fall call for anything there's
[1:59:53] going to be men and women that will
[1:59:55] stand for the word of God
[2:00:06] Amen I'm not even close to finishing a
[2:00:09] lot of my stuff let's
[2:00:12] stand if you don't stand for something
[2:00:15] you'll fall for
[2:00:17] anything that's just the way it
[2:00:19] is there's leaders in this last day that
[2:00:23] we will have to look
[2:00:24] to Amen to give us solutions to our
[2:00:29] problems but they have to be led by the
[2:00:31] Holy Ghost amen and the word of the
[2:00:36] Lord do you enjoy it do you enjoy the
[2:00:39] word
[2:00:52] I love y'all each and every one of you
[2:00:54] there's going to be times that we go
[2:00:55] through some stuff together that nobody
[2:00:58] understands amen but we're there for
[2:01:01] you we're we're there for you there's
[2:01:04] going to be pillars raised
