[41:14] this evening i would like to speak

[41:19] and there's a man
[41:20] that can turn on the light
[41:22] brother branham speaks to the sermon
[41:24] says there's a man that can turn on the
[41:25] light and we believe that don't we
[41:28] and we're glad to have him in our midst
[41:29] this evening
[41:31] amen maybe we'll just turn
[41:33] in our scriptures to matthew 4 and verse
[41:36] 12 this evening
[41:45] matthew 4 and verse 12.
[41:49] amen
[41:52] now when jesus heard that john was cast
[41:55] into the prison
[41:56] he departed into galilee
[42:00] and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt
[42:02] in capernaum
[42:04] which is upon the seacoast in the
[42:06] borders of zebelum and nephilim
[42:10] that it might be fulfilled which was
[42:11] spoken by elias the prophet saying
[42:14] the land of zebulum
[42:16] in the land of nephilim
[42:18] by the way of the sea beyond jordan
[42:21] galilee of the gentiles
[42:24] the people which sat in darkness saw
[42:27] great light
[42:29] and to them that set in the region of
[42:31] the shadow of death
[42:33] light is sprung up
[42:36] and from that time jesus began to preach
[42:38] and say
[42:40] repent
[42:41] for the kingdom of heaven
[42:43] is at hand
[42:44] amen let's just bow our heads this
[42:46] evening
[42:48] dear heavenly father lord we thank you
[42:50] for letting us be able to gather here
[42:52] once again
[42:53] lord and we feel your nearness now and
[42:56] and god we ask you that you'll just lift
[42:58] the words off the pages and just put
[43:00] them up on our hearts this evening
[43:02] lord we thank you for what you're doing
[43:04] for us and our pastor no no god i should
[43:06] be even him there in canada this evening
[43:09] i ask you to just strengthen him lord
[43:12] lord just move upon the hearts of the
[43:13] people at this time in jesus name we
[43:15] pray
[43:16] amen and amen
[43:19] amen you can be seated this evening
[43:21] as i said i'd like to speak this evening
[43:23] on light there's a man here that can
[43:26] turn on the light
[43:29] amen i believe we're a church that is
[43:32] sitting here and has recognized that man
[43:35] that has turned on the light for us a
[43:37] bride around the world has recognized
[43:39] that man that has turned on the light
[43:41] for us
[43:42] and so did the people there
[43:45] that saw the great light they saw that
[43:47] light that had come
[43:49] for they was in a shadow of death
[43:51] and that light sprung up amongst them
[43:54] and i believe that same light that has
[43:55] sprung amongst them has sprung up
[43:57] amongst us
[43:59] amen
[44:00] in genesis 1 and verse 1 and 2 and it
[44:03] says in the beginning god created the
[44:05] heaven and the earth and the earth was
[44:08] out form or void and darkness was upon
[44:11] the face of the deep
[44:12] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[44:14] face of the waters
[44:16] and god said
[44:18] let there be light and there was light
[44:21] and god saw the light
[44:23] and it was good
[44:24] and god divided the light from the
[44:27] darkness
[44:28] now here we see that god in his creating
[44:31] powers as he rolled planets off of his
[44:34] fingertips as he rolled stars and suns
[44:37] and he just held them in place and each
[44:39] one in their perfection but also
[44:42] he seen that the earth was without form
[44:44] of void and there was darkness but when
[44:46] he come
[44:48] there was a reflection of him upon there
[44:50] and he said let there be light
[44:52] for he was light
[44:54] amen he was that light in that darkness
[44:57] and he said let there be light that
[44:59] spoken word at that instant let there be
[45:02] light
[45:03] and he divided the light
[45:06] and the darkness
[45:07] the light he called day in the darkness
[45:10] he called night
[45:11] and we believe that we're in that light
[45:13] we're of that light and we're part of
[45:16] that light amen
[45:18] amen
[45:19] now all light
[45:21] destroys any darkness within it now
[45:24] we're sitting here in this building this
[45:26] evening and we thank the lord for
[45:27] electricity
[45:28] the other evening there was a power
[45:30] surge that went through my area
[45:32] and my power went off
[45:34] but see i have a generator
[45:36] underneath the porch now i had to go
[45:39] underneath there i had to plug up
[45:40] everything but there was a spark laying
[45:42] down on the inside of that generator
[45:45] but see i had the power to be able to
[45:46] turn on that light
[45:48] and jesus had that power to be able to
[45:51] speak that light that light into
[45:53] existence
[45:54] and there was light and he separated it
[45:57] so if you take a bright light in the
[45:59] darkness
[46:00] there is no darkness inside of that ring
[46:02] of light
[46:03] none whatsoever there is no darkness
[46:06] inside of there
[46:08] and that's what god will do
[46:10] as he said here in verse 4 says
[46:13] and brother brenham says it like this
[46:14] and he separated the light from the
[46:16] darkness
[46:17] and the light he called day in the
[46:19] darkness he called night
[46:21] god's word
[46:22] always separates light from darkness see
[46:25] it's the word that does the separating
[46:28] the light from the darkness
[46:29] god ever does the same thing when he
[46:31] gets ready to use anything like that
[46:34] he got to use that old star or whatever
[46:36] this this world he had to separate the
[46:39] light from the darkness now i like this
[46:41] what he says here he says and when he
[46:43] gets ready to leave to use this group of
[46:46] people he has to separate the light from
[46:49] the darkness when he gets ready to use
[46:51] an individual he has to separate the
[46:54] light from the darkness amen aren't you
[46:57] glad that that light is laying up on the
[46:59] inside of you and he separated that
[47:01] darkness out of you one day see there
[47:04] was a little bit of darkness there but
[47:05] he separated that and say i have to use
[47:08] this individual and he knew the time and
[47:10] the place that he would be using you and
[47:13] that light had sprung up inside of you
[47:15] amen
[47:17] says in first john 1 and 1
[47:19] says in the beginning was the word
[47:22] and the word was with god and the word
[47:25] was god
[47:26] the same as in the beginning with god
[47:28] all things were made by him amen
[47:32] when he spoke that all things were made
[47:34] by him and without him was not anything
[47:36] made and in him was life and the light
[47:40] and the life was the light of men and
[47:42] the light shineth in darkness and the
[47:45] darkness comprehended it not
[47:47] amen
[47:49] he was that word in the beginning as
[47:51] that song says
[47:52] jesus what a beautiful name it is that
[47:54] word at the very beginning
[47:56] amen
[47:58] and he separated it
[48:00] and separated that darkness out of us
[48:03] we went to a junkyard here several years
[48:05] ago and i might have told this story
[48:07] before but there was an individual there
[48:09] working at the junkyard on the excavator
[48:11] and he was he was explaining to us that
[48:13] he used to be a coal miner and as a coal
[48:16] miner they would have to drill way down
[48:17] into these mountains to dig out this
[48:20] coal
[48:21] well of course if you're down in those
[48:23] mountains the deepest dark holes there
[48:25] in those mountains drilling out cold
[48:27] it's dark
[48:29] and he said that there was times that
[48:30] you could put your hand in front of your
[48:32] face without no lights there and you
[48:36] couldn't even see your hand in front of
[48:38] your face
[48:39] because of where he was at
[48:41] in that darkness
[48:43] there was no light
[48:44] none whatsoever but see when you turn on
[48:47] a light in that type of darkness it
[48:50] pushes back
[48:51] all of that darkness and within that
[48:54] light he brings life within that light
[48:58] there is no shadow there was no darkness
[49:01] whatsoever in that light
[49:03] amen
[49:04] god shines his light up upon us all
[49:08] he says
[49:09] and heaven and earth shall pass away but
[49:11] my words
[49:12] shall never
[49:13] pass away
[49:15] aren't you glad that that word will
[49:16] never pass away he is not a liar god
[49:19] cannot lie
[49:20] never lies he says my word shall never
[49:23] pass away so if his word will never pass
[49:26] away
[49:27] you're with him because you was with him
[49:30] from the foundation of the world he seen
[49:32] you he knew that your seed was laying
[49:34] here and he knew that that light was
[49:36] going to shine upon you and one day that
[49:38] life was going to come forth out of that
[49:41] light amen
[49:43] we're living in a dark time
[49:45] a layout of seeing age
[49:47] an age when darkness is all around
[49:51] there was a shotgun that i used to look
[49:53] at and
[49:54] want to buy from my house and
[49:57] and it was one of those tactical type
[49:59] shotguns but they had a slogan
[50:01] with their shotgun
[50:02] and it says
[50:04] makes things that go thump in the dark
[50:06] run
[50:09] and that's what the word does
[50:11] things that go thump in the dark run
[50:13] amen aren't you glad that you have that
[50:16] word that life that light
[50:18] that when there's darkness all around
[50:21] just wreck that shotgun
[50:24] it'll make those things that go thump in
[50:26] the dark things that scare you that's
[50:28] fear upon you make them run
[50:31] well how is that
[50:33] it's that word it's that light amen
[50:37] i'm glad i'm living in a day where i
[50:39] have that word
[50:40] that word that makes things go thump in
[50:42] the dark run
[50:44] aren't you yeah amen
[50:47] we're in a dark age
[50:49] lay out a seeing age
[50:51] the church age where there's darkness
[50:53] all around us
[50:55] every year
[50:57] we well maybe it'll get better next year
[51:00] maybe in the next four years we'll vote
[51:01] for another president maybe it'll get
[51:03] better then i don't care if you're
[51:05] democrat republican whatever there is
[51:07] it's continuing to get dark
[51:10] and the darker it's getting
[51:12] so no matter what they do
[51:15] it's going to continue to get darker
[51:18] amen george washington abraham lincoln
[51:20] they all could come back all could stand
[51:22] here this evening all could go to the
[51:24] richmond halls but each year it will get
[51:27] darker
[51:28] amen why is that it's because they threw
[51:31] christ out of the churches
[51:33] amen it's because they threw christ out
[51:35] of their homes
[51:37] amen
[51:38] it's because they threw christ out of
[51:40] the courthouses it's because they threw
[51:43] christ out of the schools amen they
[51:45] didn't want no light whatsoever all they
[51:48] want is darkness and you look at a
[51:50] cricket a cricket all they want is dark
[51:53] dad has a saying you look at night times
[51:55] in the cities the cricket comes out at
[51:57] night
[51:58] he loves darkness he loves
[52:00] mischievousness
[52:02] that's those crickets and that's the
[52:04] same thing with this world they don't
[52:05] want no light they just want an idea of
[52:08] a light and as the saying goes you can't
[52:10] get worn by a painted fire
[52:12] amen
[52:14] they don't want no light they just want
[52:16] an idea of a light amen but this age is
[52:19] continuing to get it darker and darker
[52:21] and this layout of seeing age
[52:23] in mark 8 and 22
[52:26] and it reads
[52:28] and it says and he came from bethesda
[52:30] and they bringing a blind man unto him
[52:34] and he besought him to touch him and he
[52:36] took the blind man by the hand and he
[52:39] let him out of the town
[52:41] and when he had spit in his eyes he put
[52:44] his hands upon him and asked if he see
[52:47] ought and he said and he looked up and
[52:51] said i see men as trees
[52:54] walking
[52:56] and that he put his hands again on the
[52:59] man's eyes and made him look up
[53:02] and he restored and saw every man
[53:05] clearly
[53:06] amen
[53:07] so we see here he was in
[53:10] bethesda the blind man was in bethesda
[53:13] but i want you to recognize over in
[53:15] matthew 11 there was judgment that was
[53:17] set up on bethesda there was a
[53:19] destruction that has was set up on
[53:21] bethesda so there was nothing good in
[53:23] bethesda
[53:24] so jesus took the blind man
[53:27] out of there
[53:28] and so that's what he's doing in this
[53:30] age as well
[53:32] there's been judgments that's been cast
[53:33] upon this age
[53:35] but he is bringing a people out of that
[53:37] darkness out of that judgment you see
[53:40] there he has mercy upon every individual
[53:43] the same mercy he showed up on the blind
[53:44] man he said you cannot see and you will
[53:47] not see in this judgment town but you
[53:49] come with me
[53:51] walk with me out of the city and what
[53:53] did he tell him to do after he healed
[53:55] the blind man
[53:56] he don't go back in there
[53:58] do not go back in there
[54:00] those people will not believe what you
[54:02] believe
[54:03] there is judgment there so don't go back
[54:05] in if you go back in i'm sure blindness
[54:08] will be set up on him
[54:10] don't go back in where there's been
[54:11] judgment that's been cast
[54:14] but that's what the lord will do for you
[54:16] he will have mercy upon an individual
[54:19] that's been in the deepest darkest pits
[54:21] and he will say
[54:23] come out of there
[54:24] come out of that pit
[54:26] there's too much judgment that's going
[54:28] on there
[54:29] come out of there
[54:31] too much darkness there your blindness
[54:34] you're miserable blind and naked that's
[54:36] what they are in revelations 3 it tells
[54:38] what they were and it says in the
[54:40] laodiceans right said these things the
[54:42] amen and the faithful true and witness
[54:45] beginning of creation of god
[54:48] i know thy works that thou are neither
[54:49] cold nor hot
[54:51] i would rather them be cold nor hot
[54:53] because if thou were lukewarm
[54:56] i would
[54:57] neither cold nor hot i will spew thee
[54:59] out of the mouth because thou sayest
[55:02] that's what they're saying i am rich
[55:04] and increased with goods and i have need
[55:07] of nothing
[55:08] this old world that's what they're
[55:10] saying nowadays nobody wants to work
[55:13] everybody's getting paid to stay at home
[55:15] i have need of nothing rich and
[55:17] increased with goods everyone has
[55:20] something
[55:21] everyone has goods all around
[55:23] amen
[55:25] that's what this world is saying today i
[55:26] have no need of you
[55:29] amen he said i would have you rather be
[55:31] cold or hot not lukewarm cold nor hot
[55:38] because thou sayest time any christmas
[55:40] increased rich with goods have no need
[55:42] of nothing
[55:43] because
[55:45] and knowest not that they are wretched
[55:47] miserable poor blind and naked they
[55:50] can't even see their nakedness their
[55:52] blindness no more
[55:54] but god would have you to come out to be
[55:56] able to heal you of your blindness but
[55:59] he says here says i counsel thee to buy
[56:02] of me
[56:03] come unto me and by of me gold tried in
[56:06] the fire
[56:08] in that fire where there's pureness in
[56:10] that fire where all things are cast out
[56:13] pureness of gold amen come to me and buy
[56:17] of me gold trout and a fire that thou
[56:20] mayest be rich in white raiment though
[56:22] thou mayest be clothed
[56:24] and that the shame and thy nakedness do
[56:26] not appear
[56:28] anoint those eyes with isaf
[56:30] see that same thing that he had cleared
[56:32] out that blinds man eyes
[56:34] he said wiped them once and he said i
[56:37] see men there's trees still
[56:39] see there was a blurriness there was not
[56:41] a clear vision there
[56:43] but he wiped them again
[56:47] said i see men clearly
[56:49] i see it clearly i see you clearly lord
[56:53] could you imagine the first face you see
[56:55] is jesus
[56:56] after being blind all that time after
[56:59] being blind and walking in this darkness
[57:01] all that time
[57:02] you might not see anybody else around
[57:04] you any of these christians whatsoever
[57:06] but one of these days you found a way
[57:09] someone came to you and said come with
[57:11] me
[57:12] and they wiped your eyes and the first
[57:14] face you see is him
[57:16] you see no no other darkness
[57:20] no blurriness
[57:23] how good is our god to us
[57:25] so good to us this evening isn't it
[57:40] that thou mayest see amen
[57:42] aren't you glad that he's put the ice
[57:44] half upon you this evening that you
[57:46] maybe will be able to see
[57:49] he said behold i stand at the door and
[57:51] knock
[57:52] and if any man hear my voice
[57:54] i will and open the door i will come
[57:57] into him and sup with him and he with me
[58:01] as that our pastor brother ron was
[58:03] speaking there on that door the door
[58:05] latches on the inside
[58:07] opening it up to jesus that wants to
[58:10] come in and sup with you
[58:13] amen because it says in romans
[58:16] this is the way they are because that
[58:19] when they knew god they glorified him
[58:21] not as god
[58:23] neither were they thankful
[58:25] but they became vain in their
[58:27] imaginations and their foolish hearts
[58:29] was darkened
[58:31] professing them to be wise they became
[58:33] fools
[58:34] amen just as i was saying earlier there
[58:37] they they don't want church in the
[58:39] schools they don't want god in the
[58:41] schools they don't want any of that
[58:43] but
[58:44] they're too
[58:45] smart for that
[58:47] they got too much wisdom for anything to
[58:49] have
[58:50] anything with jesus in it
[58:53] they cast him down and say we can do
[58:54] better than what he's even done it
[58:56] amen i like that story granddaddy used
[58:59] to tell two scientists saying we can
[59:01] create a body just like you did lord
[59:05] they said we're going to take dirt and
[59:07] create a body he said get your own dirt
[59:12] amen
[59:13] every science wants to take and do and
[59:16] build off of what god has created but
[59:18] they they are not the creator
[59:20] amen it's just like the devil
[59:23] he's a counterfeit if there's a true
[59:25] there's a false amen so if there's a
[59:28] true light there's a false light
[59:30] a lot of people are walking in a false
[59:33] light
[59:34] amen but god does the separating and
[59:37] he'll he will knock that old self that
[59:40] old miserable self out of you amen that
[59:43] would used to hold you back and say you
[59:45] don't want no new birth
[59:47] but god will give you that new birth god
[59:49] will shine that light upon you
[59:51] amen
[59:52] see in first john 1 5
[59:55] he says and then the message which we
[59:57] have heard of him
[59:59] declared unto you that god is light and
[1:00:02] in him is no darkness
[1:00:05] i'm glad there's no darkness in him
[1:00:07] because i am in him amen so there if
[1:00:10] there's no darkness in him there's no
[1:00:12] darkness that can be set in me
[1:00:14] amen
[1:00:16] no darkness in him at all
[1:00:18] and see if we have fellowship with him
[1:00:21] and walk in darkness
[1:00:23] we lie
[1:00:24] and do not tell the truth amen but if we
[1:00:27] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:00:30] we fellowship one another
[1:00:32] and the blood of jesus christ son
[1:00:35] cleanses us from all of our sins
[1:00:39] aren't you glad of that that he will
[1:00:40] cleanse you from all of your sins
[1:00:42] amen and if you're walking in that light
[1:00:45] and having fellowship with him
[1:00:49] how great that is to have fellowship
[1:00:51] with our lord
[1:00:52] in that light that life
[1:00:54] amen
[1:00:56] he says
[1:00:57] in first in john 1 and 4 says in him was
[1:01:00] life
[1:01:01] and the light was light of men
[1:01:04] and the light shineth in darkness and
[1:01:07] the darkness comprehended it not amen
[1:01:12] excuse me for reading so many scriptures
[1:01:14] and we could go on and on about light
[1:01:16] there's so many scriptures in the bible
[1:01:17] about the light and
[1:01:19] you know i just
[1:01:20] i'm trying to narrow it down this
[1:01:22] evening and
[1:01:23] thank the lord for
[1:01:25] for giving us a revelation of light amen
[1:01:29] in john 8 and 12 it says and then speak
[1:01:32] jesus
[1:01:33] again unto them saying i am the light of
[1:01:35] the world and he that followeth me shall
[1:01:38] not walk in
[1:01:39] in darkness but he shall walk in light
[1:01:42] in john wesley's notes he would say it
[1:01:44] like this he said and he that followeth
[1:01:47] me
[1:01:48] in no wise walk in darkness
[1:01:51] he won't walk in ignorance he won't walk
[1:01:53] in wickedness he won't walk in misery
[1:01:56] but shall have light of life
[1:01:59] he that closely humbly
[1:02:02] steadily follows me
[1:02:04] shall have the divine light continually
[1:02:07] shining upon him
[1:02:09] diffusing over his soul
[1:02:11] knowledge holiness joy
[1:02:14] so he is guided
[1:02:16] by it to at life everlasting
[1:02:20] amen
[1:02:23] so many times
[1:02:24] people want to shine other people's
[1:02:26] light
[1:02:27] amen people want to shine other people's
[1:02:30] light let me let
[1:02:31] let me give you a little bit of an
[1:02:32] example by
[1:02:35] when people go with certain people to a
[1:02:37] doctor
[1:02:38] so you have somebody that will go with
[1:02:40] you to a doctor and they will sit there
[1:02:42] the doctor walks in and the doctor says
[1:02:45] okay what is your condition well the
[1:02:47] person that's don't have the illness
[1:02:50] speaks up and says well this is what's
[1:02:51] wrong with them
[1:02:55] and they and the doc okay that's that's
[1:02:57] great
[1:02:58] and but now he's done this too
[1:03:01] and and you need to know this and the
[1:03:03] doctor looks at the patient and they and
[1:03:05] they go on a little further but now we
[1:03:07] have read online that if you do this it
[1:03:09] can be cured by this
[1:03:12] i would love for one of these times
[1:03:14] the doctor would walk in
[1:03:16] tell that patient's
[1:03:19] i don't know what you would call that
[1:03:21] individual but you know their orator or
[1:03:23] whatever it would be and say all right
[1:03:26] here's the shot
[1:03:27] turn
[1:03:28] around
[1:03:30] not one time has any of those
[1:03:32] individuals ever taken a shot for the
[1:03:34] patient
[1:03:35] amen
[1:03:36] and so many times we have people that
[1:03:38] want to try to shine other people's
[1:03:39] light but they can't shine their own
[1:03:42] light
[1:03:43] amen in matthew 7 it talks about the man
[1:03:46] that wants to try to pull the beam and
[1:03:48] the mote out of the other person's eye
[1:03:49] and the beam is still in thine own eye
[1:03:52] and so many times they want to say hey
[1:03:54] this is a light shine it walk in here so
[1:03:57] if you're walking down through the woods
[1:03:59] and and you have a light and you're
[1:04:01] shining it all around and the person
[1:04:03] behind you says hey i can't see behind
[1:04:05] me let me have your light well then
[1:04:06] you're not going to be able to see
[1:04:09] you have a light
[1:04:10] you let your light shine
[1:04:13] don't hide it let your light shine amen
[1:04:17] but see what it is is
[1:04:19] you've also got to be plugged into the
[1:04:21] word
[1:04:22] for you to be able to shine your light
[1:04:24] you have to be unplugged into the word
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:29] it's just like benjamin franklin
[1:04:31] brother brandon would say it like this
[1:04:32] said when benjamin franklin when he
[1:04:35] caught that electricity and he began to
[1:04:37] scream i've got it i got it i've got it
[1:04:40] but just to say you've had it
[1:04:43] because you felt it
[1:04:45] he had it
[1:04:47] but he never did no good until it was
[1:04:49] put to work
[1:04:50] amen
[1:04:52] you can scream i've got it i've got it
[1:04:54] i've got it but until it's put to work
[1:04:57] what do you have
[1:04:59] you don't know what you have as brother
[1:05:01] brandon would say there's a lot of
[1:05:02] people going around that says i feel it
[1:05:04] i feel it i feel it i feel it i believe
[1:05:07] i feel it
[1:05:08] well that that's just a feeling but what
[1:05:11] he wants jesus said do you believe it
[1:05:15] that's when it's put to work that's when
[1:05:17] it was put into a circuit amen when you
[1:05:20] were plugged into that current as thomas
[1:05:22] edison would plug it into that current
[1:05:24] to make a light bulb
[1:05:26] benjamin franklin had it but he didn't
[1:05:28] know what he had until thomas edison
[1:05:30] plugged it into that light bulb and he
[1:05:32] had current
[1:05:33] and i believe it
[1:05:35] amen that's what i want to be plugged
[1:05:37] into is his word
[1:05:39] his current
[1:05:40] that says
[1:05:41] i believe it not just i got it amen
[1:05:45] see because ye are the light of the
[1:05:47] world a city set up on a hill and that
[1:05:50] cannot be hid amen aren't you glad that
[1:05:53] you're a light of this world and neither
[1:05:55] do men light a candle and put it under a
[1:05:57] bushel or on a candlestick
[1:06:00] but it giveth light unto all that are in
[1:06:02] the house
[1:06:03] you want to shine your light into all
[1:06:05] your family
[1:06:06] but
[1:06:07] like i said
[1:06:08] they're going to have to catch that
[1:06:10] light also
[1:06:11] they're going to have to tune into that
[1:06:12] electric circuit that word that power
[1:06:16] and they're going to have to walk in
[1:06:17] their light
[1:06:19] and we don't know times when when
[1:06:21] certain family members will catch it
[1:06:23] amen but god knows
[1:06:26] amen from the foundation of the world
[1:06:28] god knew what seed would be laying here
[1:06:30] all seeds everything that would come up
[1:06:32] was laying there from the foundation of
[1:06:34] the world
[1:06:35] and god said at the certain time it
[1:06:36] would come up
[1:06:38] and that light would bring it forth
[1:06:41] just as much as
[1:06:43] the s-o-n the s-u-n would bring forth
[1:06:46] plants trees and grass
[1:06:48] amen it's just like that seed that's
[1:06:50] buried underneath a concrete
[1:06:53] before long that sun is going to shine
[1:06:55] down and that warmth that's laying
[1:06:57] laying upon that concrete is going to
[1:06:59] warm up that dirt it's going to warm up
[1:07:01] that seed and before long that seed is
[1:07:03] going to break forth out of that shock
[1:07:05] and before long it's going to make his
[1:07:06] way and work its way around and it'll
[1:07:09] work its way up right around the edge of
[1:07:11] that concrete
[1:07:12] because even concrete laying down laying
[1:07:15] up on you it won't stop that seed for
[1:07:18] coming forth no matter where you are in
[1:07:20] your life when that light shines upon
[1:07:23] you
[1:07:24] it won't stop it from coming forth
[1:07:26] there's no darkness heavy enough that
[1:07:28] can stop that seed from coming forth
[1:07:31] when that warmth that holy ghost can
[1:07:33] move upon you and brood upon that life
[1:07:35] and that life starts to quicken and
[1:07:38] something inside of it it says i haven't
[1:07:40] felt this before but there's something
[1:07:42] that's laying on the inside of me right
[1:07:44] now
[1:07:45] i can't stop it from coming forth
[1:07:48] and when you get that life on the inside
[1:07:49] of you you can't stop it you can try to
[1:07:52] hide it you can try to say
[1:07:54] well i'm like i used to be but you know
[1:07:57] on the inside of you there's something
[1:07:58] that's laying there and you can't stop
[1:08:00] shining that light amen
[1:08:03] when you try to just stand there and you
[1:08:04] and you're just like no i don't want it
[1:08:06] but all of a sudden there's something
[1:08:07] moves over top of you and that light
[1:08:10] comes forth and before long you start
[1:08:12] rejoicing you say well i never did this
[1:08:14] before i never acted like this before
[1:08:16] well there's something on the inside
[1:08:19] that's been moving
[1:08:20] there's something that's been growing
[1:08:22] there's something that's brooding over
[1:08:24] that life and it's saying come forth and
[1:08:26] i'm quickening you and you begin to grow
[1:08:29] and all of a sudden people around you
[1:08:30] they're going you're not the same person
[1:08:33] that you used to be
[1:08:34] and well i don't know what happened
[1:08:37] but we know what happened
[1:08:39] we know you and there's no turning back
[1:08:41] once that sun hits there's no going back
[1:08:43] down into that shock there's no going
[1:08:45] back underneath that concrete that
[1:08:47] darkness there's no going back because
[1:08:49] that light has brewed on the inside of
[1:08:52] you is pushing you forward and it's
[1:08:54] pulling you up a little higher
[1:08:56] oh i love that life that life that's
[1:08:59] been laid on the inside of each and
[1:09:01] every one of us that says drawn out of
[1:09:03] her
[1:09:04] drawed out of that darkness
[1:09:06] in this dark age
[1:09:09] amen when there's darkness all around
[1:09:11] darkness through every age come forth
[1:09:13] but you are living in laodicea the
[1:09:15] darkest age that there was when they
[1:09:17] would say that there's just just shining
[1:09:19] just a little bit of light there's just
[1:09:21] a little bit of light there and you're
[1:09:23] that light in this darkness
[1:09:25] you're that light shining when people
[1:09:27] come up to you and you might be in the
[1:09:29] store or the gas station or whatever it
[1:09:31] may be and said
[1:09:33] there's a light that's over top of you
[1:09:36] now you you can't make that happen you
[1:09:38] can't
[1:09:40] oh there's a light in me let me shine it
[1:09:46] we don't have that cartoon character
[1:09:48] thing where you can click a button all
[1:09:50] of a sudden a light bulb
[1:09:54] there's a light i want to shine it i
[1:09:56] want to shine it
[1:09:57] you can't shine it like that
[1:10:00] what's the best way to shine your light
[1:10:02] you eat this word
[1:10:05] you you when you eat this word and you
[1:10:07] let that word take over your life
[1:10:10] that word will then shine forth
[1:10:13] and and things that you cared about
[1:10:16] before
[1:10:17] they don't make a hill of beans and you
[1:10:19] go well i don't know why i don't do that
[1:10:21] no more but i really don't care to do
[1:10:23] that
[1:10:24] amen as brother joe green would say i
[1:10:27] drink as much as i want to i smoke as
[1:10:30] much as i want to
[1:10:31] because god took that want to out of me
[1:10:34] amen and why because that word that word
[1:10:37] that's been quickened on the inside of
[1:10:39] you
[1:10:40] amen
[1:10:42] see we are a representation of god
[1:10:45] of christ and that life that light
[1:10:49] and that life is laying and lives there
[1:10:52] and we are the light of this world
[1:10:54] amen
[1:10:55] if we're
[1:10:57] then with him in him being and god knew
[1:11:00] us from the foundation of the world
[1:11:03] i was glad when i was there with him
[1:11:05] when he said let there be light
[1:11:07] i was glad that i was there at that
[1:11:09] moment you say well you wasn't there at
[1:11:11] that i was in his mind
[1:11:13] i was in him at that very moment when he
[1:11:16] said let there be light and he said
[1:11:18] there is a son that's laying there
[1:11:20] matthew david spencer and he seen me at
[1:11:23] that moment he said at this certain time
[1:11:26] at this certain place
[1:11:27] it's going to come forth
[1:11:29] and each and every one of us sitting
[1:11:31] here this evening we was laying there
[1:11:32] from the foundation of the world in his
[1:11:35] image in his mind that light
[1:11:37] you didn't even know how you got here
[1:11:39] brother shannon you didn't know
[1:11:41] i mean a phone call one day and all of a
[1:11:43] sudden the light it's like
[1:11:45] it quickens you
[1:11:47] and there was no turning back
[1:11:50] it was
[1:11:51] it's gone it's over
[1:11:53] many of us are sitting here and say i
[1:11:55] don't even know how i got in the
[1:11:57] building i don't know how i got to the
[1:11:59] brick building down there but one night
[1:12:01] i found my way to an altar amen
[1:12:05] but it happened that light see and he
[1:12:08] knew where he was at that time
[1:12:11] he knew you'd live in this age
[1:12:17] i'm glad to be able to live in this age
[1:12:19] i'm glad to be able to say when i get
[1:12:22] there i come through laodicea
[1:12:24] i come through the darkest of the darks
[1:12:27] amen
[1:12:29] but why why are we able to come through
[1:12:31] this dark
[1:12:32] it's because we've been given a light
[1:12:35] it's because we've been given
[1:12:37] in revelations as it would say
[1:12:40] the stars
[1:12:41] amen we've been given that star that
[1:12:44] star has light
[1:12:46] amen
[1:12:50] excuse me i lost my place here
[1:12:56] each and every age in revelations 1 to
[1:12:58] 20 and 12 it says
[1:13:01] and i turned and i seen a voice and
[1:13:03] spake with me
[1:13:04] and being turned i saw
[1:13:06] seven gold seven golden candle sticks
[1:13:09] and midst of the candlesticks
[1:13:11] one likened to the son of man clothed
[1:13:13] with a garment down to the foot in the
[1:13:15] girdle
[1:13:16] the paps with a golden girdle
[1:13:19] his head and his hairs was white as wool
[1:13:22] as white as the snow his eyes were a
[1:13:25] flame of fire and his feet like into the
[1:13:27] fine brass
[1:13:29] and as
[1:13:30] they burned in the furnace in his voice
[1:13:33] as the sound of many waters and he had
[1:13:36] in his right hand
[1:13:37] seven stars and out of his mouth when a
[1:13:40] sharp two-widget sword
[1:13:42] two-widget sword and his countenance was
[1:13:45] as the sun shineth in his strength
[1:13:48] and when i saw him i fell on my feet as
[1:13:51] dead
[1:13:52] and laid at his right hand upon me
[1:13:55] saying fear not
[1:13:58] i am the first and the last
[1:14:00] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[1:14:03] behold i am alive forevermore amen
[1:14:06] and have the keys to hell and death
[1:14:09] write the things which thou has seen and
[1:14:12] the things which are and the things
[1:14:15] which shall be hereafter the mystery of
[1:14:17] the seven stars which thou saust in my
[1:14:20] right hand and the seven golden
[1:14:22] candlesticks the seven stars the seven
[1:14:25] stars are the angels to the seven
[1:14:28] churches the seven golden candlesticks
[1:14:30] which thou
[1:14:32] sawest are the seven churches
[1:14:35] i'm glad that we have a revelation of
[1:14:38] those stars i'm glad that he showed us
[1:14:41] each and every one of those stars
[1:14:43] and those stars
[1:14:44] shining light in each to every dark age
[1:14:50] there is paul
[1:14:52] that was a star in his age
[1:14:54] a shining light arrhenius
[1:14:56] with a star in his age martin
[1:14:59] colombo of ireland martin luther each
[1:15:02] one was a star in their age john wesley
[1:15:06] and it comes all the way down to william
[1:15:08] marion branham each one was a star in
[1:15:11] each and every one of their age
[1:15:13] and they had to shine their light for
[1:15:16] what they had been given to shine in
[1:15:18] this dark age
[1:15:20] i want to tell a little bit of a
[1:15:21] testimony here
[1:15:24] back several years ago
[1:15:26] when
[1:15:27] people were
[1:15:28] making fun of brother branham and
[1:15:32] saying that he's not a vindicated
[1:15:33] prophet
[1:15:36] i'm sitting in my i'm standing in my
[1:15:39] kitchen of my garage and me and cassie's
[1:15:41] just talking
[1:15:43] and i look at cassie and i say
[1:15:46] william branham is a vindicated prophet
[1:15:49] if william branham wasn't a vindicated
[1:15:51] prophet
[1:15:52] neither was paul
[1:15:54] irenaeus
[1:15:55] martin columbo
[1:15:58] martin luther john wesley if he wasn't
[1:16:00] the vindicated prophet for this age
[1:16:03] they weren't the vindicated prophet for
[1:16:05] each and every one of those ages and we
[1:16:07] have missed it all
[1:16:09] and about the time i said that there was
[1:16:11] a light that come through my garage
[1:16:13] [Music]
[1:16:15] i said cassie did you see that
[1:16:17] i didn't see it but i feel that
[1:16:21] see he vindicated his word through that
[1:16:23] prophet
[1:16:24] he vindicated his word through each and
[1:16:26] every prophet each and every one that
[1:16:28] come down through each and every age
[1:16:30] and said this is my prophet this is the
[1:16:32] one that's shining light in this dark
[1:16:34] age
[1:16:36] amen
[1:16:43] i don't think i put it in my notes
[1:16:47] but just bear with me for a minute
[1:16:55] amen
[1:17:05] trying to remember the full story here
[1:17:09] when brother branham was on the ohio
[1:17:10] river
[1:17:11] and he was baptizing all those people
[1:17:15] and a voice come out of there
[1:17:17] and said so so was john the baptist
[1:17:20] forerunned my first coming
[1:17:22] so shall you forerun my second coming
[1:17:26] and there was a fire that come down
[1:17:27] through there
[1:17:28] and there was a lady that brother
[1:17:30] branham had
[1:17:31] had asked said please cover up
[1:17:34] please
[1:17:35] go and move on away from here
[1:17:38] and as that pillow of fire came down and
[1:17:40] as that voice spoke out of there said
[1:17:43] vindicating this prophet
[1:17:45] that lady pitched forward in the boat
[1:17:47] and from that point on was an insane
[1:17:49] asylum
[1:17:51] you don't make fun of this word
[1:17:54] you don't make fun of the prophets
[1:17:57] you say well i
[1:17:58] i don't believe so much in that
[1:18:01] that testimony i don't believe so much
[1:18:02] in that story
[1:18:05] see we all were in darkness
[1:18:08] we all
[1:18:10] all were sinners
[1:18:11] oh
[1:18:16] all needed that light to be quickened
[1:18:18] inside of us
[1:18:19] see in first john 1 and 8 it says
[1:18:22] if we say we have no sin
[1:18:24] we deceive ourselves
[1:18:27] and the truth is not in us
[1:18:29] if we confess our sins he is faithful
[1:18:32] and just to forgive us of all of our
[1:18:34] sins and cleanse us from all
[1:18:35] unrighteousness
[1:18:37] amen
[1:18:39] see he we need forgiveness of our sins
[1:18:42] and the blood of christ is the divine
[1:18:44] provision for each and every one of our
[1:18:46] sins
[1:18:48] see and in first john 2 and 1 it says my
[1:18:51] children these things i write unto you
[1:18:54] that if you
[1:18:55] that sin not
[1:18:56] and if any man sin you have an advocate
[1:19:00] with the father jesus christ his
[1:19:02] righteousness
[1:19:04] and he is the perpetuation for our sins
[1:19:07] and not for ours only but also for the
[1:19:10] sins of the world
[1:19:11] i'm glad i have an advocate with the
[1:19:13] father i'm glad that he was with me
[1:19:16] even when i i didn't think i was
[1:19:19] lost i was lost
[1:19:21] but when i come to i said lord i need a
[1:19:23] savior
[1:19:24] i need i need an advocate
[1:19:27] and you might be sitting there and you
[1:19:29] might be critical
[1:19:30] of those testimonies and say i don't but
[1:19:33] you are without sin no
[1:19:36] we all have sinned
[1:19:38] and come short of the grace of god
[1:19:41] amen and to walk in light is to live in
[1:19:43] fellowship with jesus christ
[1:19:46] see sin interrupts that fellowship and
[1:19:48] cannot change the relationship
[1:19:51] confession restores a full fellowship
[1:19:54] with jesus christ and an immediate
[1:19:56] confession will keep you
[1:19:59] with that fellowship and that will be
[1:20:00] unbroken
[1:20:02] so let your light shine amen
[1:20:06] see in genesis 15
[1:20:09] the lord spoke to abram and said i am
[1:20:11] thy shield and thy exceedingly great
[1:20:13] reward
[1:20:14] and a little bit further down he says
[1:20:18] and he brought forth him
[1:20:20] abroad and said look now towards the
[1:20:22] heavens
[1:20:23] and tell the stars if thou art able to
[1:20:25] number them
[1:20:27] and he said unto him
[1:20:28] so shall thy seed be
[1:20:31] each and every one of you
[1:20:33] laying here
[1:20:34] that you didn't know you'd be here
[1:20:36] so shall you'd come forth
[1:20:40] god knows where you're at in each and
[1:20:41] every time each and every place
[1:20:44] knows your condition
[1:20:45] knows what you're going through
[1:20:47] dad tells this testimony about how that
[1:20:50] he was when he was preaching in alaska
[1:20:52] and they had those bull horns on the
[1:20:54] church and it was just blowing forth and
[1:20:57] down through those valleys and he said
[1:20:59] and you might be a wall from the army
[1:21:02] running but god knows where you're at
[1:21:05] and there was a boy that was sitting in
[1:21:06] a truck down the road about ready to
[1:21:08] commit suicide
[1:21:10] he said
[1:21:12] that's me
[1:21:14] i
[1:21:16] i was lost
[1:21:18] and just in that moment
[1:21:21] that light
[1:21:22] god knew where he was
[1:21:24] god knew
[1:21:26] i have a son in alaska that's running
[1:21:29] that needs life
[1:21:31] and that light shined upon him there
[1:21:34] see for we were sometimes in darkness
[1:21:38] we can't say that we've always been
[1:21:40] light
[1:21:41] there's a whole lot of us here that are
[1:21:42] sitting here that says we were in
[1:21:44] darkness and we knew we were in darkness
[1:21:48] but i'm glad we're in that light now
[1:21:50] i'm glad that we can walk with him in
[1:21:52] that light in that life
[1:22:05] you know you might be in
[1:22:07] in a spot in your life
[1:22:10] and you're in a pit
[1:22:13] pit of darkness put a despair and you've
[1:22:15] fallen
[1:22:16] and you say i
[1:22:17] i just can't get out
[1:22:21] but you can take that sword
[1:22:23] that remembrance
[1:22:25] and you can call upon that name of jesus
[1:22:28] and you might be able to take that sword
[1:22:29] and there ain't no devils down there at
[1:22:31] that moment but you hit a rock and it'll
[1:22:33] throw a spark there's a little bit of
[1:22:35] light there and you say oh i can see the
[1:22:37] next step
[1:22:39] and you throw that sword again and you
[1:22:40] hit a little bit more light and you
[1:22:42] start climbing your way out of that pit
[1:22:46] many times you feel like
[1:22:48] i'm in the deepest darkest place in that
[1:22:50] pit
[1:22:51] and have fallen so far
[1:22:54] see
[1:22:55] adam and eve had fallen into that
[1:22:57] deepest darkest pit
[1:22:59] but god said i'm going to make a way for
[1:23:01] you
[1:23:02] i'm going to make a way for you out of
[1:23:03] there
[1:23:04] you can come out of there you can come
[1:23:06] out of that pit you can come out of that
[1:23:08] despair that you're in
[1:23:10] climb your way out of there
[1:23:12] you can keep coming forth
[1:23:14] but now it's not over once you get out
[1:23:15] of that pit
[1:23:17] there's a whole lot of devils that
[1:23:18] you're going to have to keep fighting
[1:23:20] amen you're going to have to keep
[1:23:22] carrying that sword that word of the
[1:23:24] lord
[1:23:25] and starts flinging that thing and
[1:23:27] shining that light
[1:23:29] amen just as i said earlier you can't
[1:23:31] just stand there and shout say i want to
[1:23:33] shine a light you have to do something
[1:23:35] you have to connect you have to get a
[1:23:37] hold of that light
[1:23:39] amen
[1:23:42] amen maybe as the musicians are coming
[1:23:44] this evening
[1:23:47] in revelations 22 and 5 it says
[1:23:49] and there shall
[1:23:51] be no night there
[1:23:53] i plan on going to that city
[1:23:56] where there is no night
[1:23:58] no need no candle
[1:24:00] neither light of the sun
[1:24:03] for the lord god giveth them light
[1:24:06] he is our light
[1:24:08] i plan on going to that city
[1:24:10] where there's no darkness no torments
[1:24:14] where god is the light
[1:24:17] and we'll live forevermore

[1:33:50] that he could shine his word through you
[1:33:53] and it would be a light into a dying
[1:33:55] generation
[1:33:57] i just love it when the word of the lord
[1:33:59] begins to work through our lives
[1:34:02] that's what the word does it shines a
[1:34:04] light
[1:34:05] it makes us correct all the wrong errors
[1:34:07] in our life it makes us recognize our
[1:34:10] wrongdoings and it makes us recognize
[1:34:12] that he is the author
[1:34:14] and the finisher of our faith i'm so
[1:34:17] thankful for this word that has shined a
[1:34:19] light in this generation upon us and i'd
[1:34:22] say we've been truly blessed by the
[1:34:23] message of the hour
[1:34:25] i tell you what i don't know where we'd
[1:34:27] be without this message but i i'm
[1:34:29] certainly thankful that god released a
[1:34:32] star in this generation
[1:34:34] not a basketball star not a wandering
[1:34:36] star
[1:34:37] but a but a seventh messenger that would
[1:34:39] come by our way and shine the light on
[1:34:42] our hearts
[1:34:43] aren't you thankful for that star that
[1:34:45] that brought us a message to draw us out
[1:34:48] of those things that maybe were we
[1:34:50] wouldn't even think we'd have been
[1:34:51] involved in but if it wasn't for a
[1:34:53] message you'd have been there
[1:34:55] but this message this message changed
[1:34:57] your course
[1:34:58] and i'm so thankful
[1:35:00] i'm so thankful for the message of the
[1:35:02] hour amen why don't you give the lord a
[1:35:04] handclap of praise this evening amen
[1:35:08] amen amen we just love the lord with all
[1:35:11] of our hearts and that's what we've come
[1:35:13] tonight to do is to let his light shine
[1:35:16] on our life and
[1:35:17] if light wasn't so powerful then why
[1:35:19] would satan transform himself to be
[1:35:23] you know to be one that would transform
[1:35:25] himself in light he recognizes the power
[1:35:27] of it so he wants to he wants to
[1:35:29] transition himself there but i'm so
[1:35:31] thankful to know that i've got my eyes
[1:35:34] on the author of life amen amen as
[1:35:37] you're dismissed this evening as we sing
[1:35:39] this song go in the name of the lord and

[1:36:11] i give myself i give
[1:36:15] myself to you lord
