[45:19] 23 amen let's have church amen we've
[45:24] come we've gathered let's have church
[45:28] Hebrews 11 and: 23 by faith Moses when
[45:32] he was born and was hid 3 months of his
[45:35] parents because they saw that he was a
[45:38] proper child and they were not afraid of
[45:41] the king's commandment by faith Moses
[45:44] when he was come to years refused to be
[45:46] called the son of Pharaoh's
[45:49] daughter powerful statement next
[45:52] choosing rather to suffer
[45:55] affliction with the people of God than
[45:59] to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[46:02] season I want to read that scripture
[46:05] with you together because you have done
[46:07] the same thing that's right choosing
[46:10] rather to suffer Affliction with the
[46:13] people of God than to enjoy the
[46:16] pleasures of sin for a
[46:19] season then goes further esteeming the
[46:23] reproach of Christ greater than the
[46:25] riches of the treasures of Egypt for hea
[46:28] had respect under the recompense of the
[46:32] reward by faith he forsake forsook Egypt
[46:37] not fearing the Wrath of the king for he

[47:57] we celebrated the 4th of July here in
[48:00] America and for those that are listening
[48:03] by the way and many other countries they
[48:05] don't understand what we're saying but
[48:07] that is our independence day that we
[48:10] celebrate and independence from from
[48:13] other countries especially with great
[48:16] oppression for their tax purposes and
[48:19] for their holding control over our
[48:21] nation it was a great thing for our
[48:24] nation to find their freedom
[48:27] but Freedom comes with a great
[48:31] cost many lives were lost because of the
[48:36] cost and there's a lot of stories that
[48:39] goes with it and men like Paul rever
[48:43] that would make a long R ride one night
[48:45] and begin to scream to a nation a Young
[48:48] Nation screaming the British are coming
[48:51] the British are coming it is Untold of
[48:54] how many lives would die within the few
[48:57] days because we were wanting our freedom
[49:00] and we were willing to stand up for it
[49:04] you know a lot of people want freedom
[49:06] but they're not willing to stand up for
[49:09] it a lot of people gave their lives to
[49:12] continue to have freedom we have great
[49:16] great cemeteries that are dedicated to
[49:19] our War veterans and great great
[49:21] memorials that are there and names that
[49:24] are written on it let me just say this
[49:26] to you
[49:27] don't never take that for
[49:30] granted don't never take that for
[49:33] granted brother Ron but you shouldn't
[49:35] bring politics in it well let me just
[49:37] say this to you if you want to burn our
[49:40] flag if you want to hate our nation if
[49:44] you want to if you want to do bad things
[49:46] to our country
[49:50] move
[49:54] leave leave
[49:59] amen this is one of the greatest Nations
[50:02] on the world and and I still stand for
[50:06] her yes we're from another country but
[50:09] we are a nation Americans and I'm proud
[50:12] to be an
[50:15] American you want to quote brother
[50:17] brandom said I stand with her in her
[50:19] glory and I stand with her inner shame
[50:23] across across uh sister Joyce Sister
[50:26] Evelyn there maybe last night I saw them
[50:29] there there live real clur to a place
[50:31] called C pepper and in C pepper there
[50:34] was a preacher that was there that that
[50:38] that was a man that did not want to be
[50:40] under the oppress oppression of the
[50:43] original uh church and and so the church
[50:47] was trying to force him to preach a
[50:49] certain thing but he wanted to preach
[50:52] the word of God and stand in
[50:54] Freedom and it came with
[50:57] cost they they put him in stocks and he
[51:01] would be there until he died but he
[51:04] didn't just stand there and say poor old
[51:06] me poor old me poor old me he stood
[51:09] there and
[51:10] preached with his arms in stalks in his
[51:13] head and his neck in stalks and he
[51:16] preached a sermon called Give me liberty
[51:18] or give me
[51:20] death amen there was a man that rode
[51:24] past and he was on a horse this man so
[51:27] happened to be Patrick
[51:29] Henry Patrick Henry stopped and listened
[51:33] to this man preach and it so moved
[51:37] Patrick Henry he couldn't free this man
[51:40] but it so moved him until he went back
[51:43] to the halls of the men that he was
[51:45] serving with in the young government he
[51:49] stood to his feet and he gave the
[51:52] resounding statement that that preacher
[51:55] had said yes
[51:58] amen and he gave the speech of why
[52:02] should we be under the shackles of
[52:05] England and all of Great Britain and all
[52:07] the people that are trying to force us
[52:09] to be a certain way and he and he came
[52:13] to the conclusion Give me
[52:18] liberty Give me liberty or give me
[52:24] death now let let me to say it caused a
[52:28] movement within our young
[52:31] government and these were men that were
[52:34] sitting with him and I don't know if
[52:36] you've you've kind of given this thought
[52:40] but when they write the Declaration of
[52:43] Independence it's going to come with a
[52:48] cost it's going to come with a cost when
[52:51] you identify with a certain thing it
[52:54] comes with a cost I'm going to get to
[52:57] you in just a little bit just be patient
[52:59] with me these 56 men were proud to put
[53:05] their
[53:06] names on this document of a Young Nation
[53:11] that would declare their
[53:13] independence their
[53:17] freedom maybe you've never thought about
[53:20] it but maybe you've wondered what
[53:21] happened to these 56 men well let me
[53:25] just take a minute to to just just share
[53:28] with you five of the S siners were
[53:32] captured by the British as
[53:35] Traders and tortured before they died 12
[53:39] had their homes rans Saed and burned two
[53:43] lost their sons in the Revolutionary War
[53:47] another had Sons captured nine of the 56
[53:51] fought and died from wounds and
[53:54] hardships of the revolution Ary
[53:59] War they signed and pledged their lives
[54:03] their Tor their fortunes and their their
[54:05] sacred honor what kind of a men were
[54:08] they 24 of them were lawyers jurist 11
[54:14] were Merchants nine were farmers and
[54:16] large plantation owners men of means
[54:20] well educated but they signed the
[54:24] Declaration of Independence fully
[54:27] knowing well that that the plent of the
[54:30] penalty but would be death if they were
[54:36] captured Carter Braxton of Virginia a
[54:39] wealthy planter and Trader saw his ship
[54:41] swept away from the Seas by the British
[54:44] Navy he sold his home and his properties
[54:48] to pay his debt and he died in rags
[54:52] Thomas Thomas McKing was hounded by the
[54:55] British that forced him to move from his
[54:58] family almost consciously he served in
[55:01] the Congress without pay his family was
[55:04] kept in hiding his possessions were
[55:07] taken away from him and
[55:10] poverty was his
[55:13] reward vandals and soldiers of both
[55:17] looted properties of of Ellery and Clore
[55:21] and Hall and Walton and gwenan and and
[55:26] Haywood and rutage and
[55:28] Middleton at the Battle of Yorktown
[55:31] Thomas Nelson noted that the British
[55:33] general Cornwall Wallace had taken
[55:37] Nelson's home for his headquarters and
[55:40] the owner owner quietly urged General
[55:44] George
[55:45] Washington open fire on my home
[55:56] the home was
[55:58] destroyed and Nelson died in
[56:02] complete
[56:04] bankruptcy Francis Lewis had his home
[56:07] and property destroyed the enemy jailed
[56:11] his wife and she died within a few
[56:13] months John Hart was driven from his
[56:16] home his wife's bedside as she was dying
[56:19] their 13 children fled for their lives
[56:22] his field and his grindstone were laid
[56:25] to waste
[56:26] for more than a year he lived in forest
[56:29] and Cays returning home to find his wife
[56:32] dead and his children vanished a few
[56:35] weeks later he died from exhaustion with
[56:38] a broken heart Norris and Livingston
[56:41] suffered the same kind of
[56:44] Fate all of these are
[56:47] stories of the 56
[56:50] men who were willing to sign their name
[56:55] to the dec clation of
[56:59] Independence there was one man that we
[57:02] all know his name is John
[57:07] Hancock he's famous because his name is
[57:10] the
[57:11] largest but John Hancock had a reason to
[57:14] sign his name that large he said I want
[57:18] to sign my name so large until the king
[57:21] will not have to put his reading glasses
[57:24] on to see my name
[57:28] go ahead and give them a great big hand
[57:30] right
[57:38] now we live in such a day of Pumped and
[57:42] Splendor and
[57:43] plastic until people don't feel the cost
[57:46] to be an
[57:49] American we've got it really good right
[57:52] now it ain't going to be that way much
[57:54] longer because the prophet told us that
[57:57] way but not only that God sent us a
[58:02] message that has came with great cost to
[58:06] it I'd like to share some of those
[58:08] things with us this morning by faith
[58:11] Moses by faith Moses chose the
[58:15] Affliction that's of the people of God
[58:19] rather than to be the next Pharaoh in
[58:22] line and live in plush
[58:26] this is quite a
[58:29] choice this is quite a choice we should
[58:32] never
[58:35] complain we should never listen we don't
[58:38] have a right to
[58:40] complain he forsook
[58:44] Egypt there will be a lot of things that
[58:46] you'll have to forsake in your life but
[58:49] it'll be worth it
[58:51] [Music]
[58:52] [Applause]
[58:53] all Paul would write it in verse 33 of
[58:57] the same chapter of chapter 11 and talk
[59:00] about some of our Runners that would
[59:02] have to make choices who through faith
[59:04] subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness
[59:08] obtained promises stopped the mouths of
[59:11] lions quench the violence of fire escape
[59:14] the edge of the sword out of weaknesses
[59:17] were made strong wax Valiant in Flight
[59:20] fight turn to flight the armies of the
[59:22] adens women receed their dead raised to
[59:25] life again others were tortured not
[59:28] accepting Deliverance but they that they
[59:31] might obtain a better resurrection and
[59:35] others had trial of cruel mockings and
[59:38] scourgings yay moreover abondon
[59:40] imprisonment they were
[59:43] stoned they were swn aunder were tempted
[59:47] were slain with a sword they wondered
[59:50] about in sheep skins and goat skins
[59:52] being destitute Afflicted and tormented
[59:57] right of whom the world was not worthy
[1:00:01] they wandered in dens and in mountains
[1:00:03] and in dens and caves of the earth and
[1:00:05] these all having obtained a good report
[1:00:09] through faith received not the
[1:00:12] promise it didn't say that they lived a
[1:00:15] plush life it didn't say that they lived
[1:00:18] in castles with Kings and
[1:00:21] princes they lived with caves they lived
[1:00:24] in mountains they lived
[1:00:26] right but they refuse to give
[1:00:33] up I love the scripture of whom the
[1:00:36] world was not
[1:00:37] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[1:00:40] mountains and dens and caves of the
[1:00:42] earth and these all having obtained a
[1:00:44] good report through faith received not
[1:00:47] the promise God having provided some
[1:00:50] better thing for
[1:00:54] us let's read this all together it's too
[1:00:57] good God having provided some better
[1:01:01] thing for us that they without us should
[1:01:06] not be
[1:01:10] perfect there are waiting on
[1:01:14] us they can't finish the Redemption
[1:01:17] report until we make
[1:01:21] it
[1:01:22] hallelujah
[1:01:24] hallelujah Hebrews 12 and verse 1
[1:01:28] wherefore seeing we are also compassed
[1:01:30] about with so great a cloud of
[1:01:33] witnesses oh I love this scripture this
[1:01:36] scripture set me on fire many years ago
[1:01:39] let
[1:01:42] us let
[1:01:52] us let us lay aside every weight right
[1:01:57] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:02:00] sin which does so easily beset us and
[1:02:04] let us run with
[1:02:07] patience the
[1:02:08] race that is set before
[1:02:16] us George Washington was persistent this
[1:02:20] is in
[1:02:22] perseverance George Washington was pers
[1:02:25] persistent at Valley
[1:02:26] Forge all the odds was against him the
[1:02:30] enemy was across the river but after all
[1:02:34] night in
[1:02:35] prayer and the American soldiers with no
[1:02:38] shoes on their feet about onethird of
[1:02:42] them had shoes and they crossed a river
[1:02:44] at Valley Forge through the ice and
[1:02:47] three musket bullets went through his
[1:02:50] coat but he had an answer from
[1:02:53] God and there was no need of of him
[1:02:56] backing down nothing could stop him
[1:02:59] then I say this you nothing can stop us
[1:03:04] now we have an answer from
[1:03:07] [Applause]
[1:03:12] God may this be our testimony he crossed
[1:03:16] it because he was persistent he had hurt
[1:03:20] from God and that's the way we've got to
[1:03:23] be if God says so that settles
[1:03:29] it in job chap 13 and verse
[1:03:33] 13 hold your peace let me alone that I
[1:03:38] may speak and let come on me what
[1:03:44] will wherefore do I take my flesh and in
[1:03:47] my teeth and put my life in my hand
[1:03:51] though he slay me
[1:03:58] though he slay me yet will I trust
[1:04:06] him but I will maintain my
[1:04:10] ways before
[1:04:13] him when God told me on December the
[1:04:18] 22nd if you trust me I'll use you like
[1:04:21] never
[1:04:24] before maybe in some of my thoughts I
[1:04:27] thought it would be glorious and some of
[1:04:28] the things that would be in my
[1:04:31] way I've been around the world
[1:04:34] preaching I've stood in some Precious
[1:04:37] Places some absolutely awesome places
[1:04:41] I've stood in some of the greatest
[1:04:44] conventions of the
[1:04:46] message I did not know in a couple of
[1:04:48] weeks
[1:04:50] cancer would be my news and I would
[1:04:53] still be here fighting it four years
[1:04:55] later
[1:04:57] but I trust that you have never seen me
[1:05:00] Sher my
[1:05:03] responsibility I trust that you have
[1:05:05] never seen me so weak in my flesh until
[1:05:08] I was willing to give up if we've got a
[1:05:11] fight let us fight
[1:05:29] every one of us are going to pay a
[1:05:32] cost every one of your testimonies are
[1:05:35] different how you got here how you have
[1:05:38] had to stand how you have come maybe
[1:05:40] with the clothes on your back but you
[1:05:43] came
[1:05:46] regardless cost all goes all the way
[1:05:49] back to
[1:05:50] Abraham he is buying a b a burial place
[1:05:54] for Sarah
[1:05:56] and he goes to his he goes to the people
[1:05:59] in the community it's a special spot
[1:06:02] that he wants to
[1:06:04] bury he wants to bury her in a special
[1:06:12] spot she was the love of his
[1:06:17] life she was the one that got changed
[1:06:20] back to young
[1:06:21] again she was his childhood sweetheart
[1:06:26] she was the one that held a testimony
[1:06:28] with him no doubt she had doubted for
[1:06:32] years and doubted for years but she had
[1:06:34] heard him give the
[1:06:36] testimony even 25 years we're going to
[1:06:39] have a
[1:06:40] son and even having a son now that son
[1:06:43] grows up and she would have to allow
[1:06:46] Abraham to trust God when God tells him
[1:06:51] the the greatest trial that he ever have
[1:06:54] offer thy son
[1:06:56] thy only
[1:06:59] son he had trusted God to have him but
[1:07:03] now he has to trust God if he takes his
[1:07:07] life God will raise him back up again
[1:07:10] that's
[1:07:13] right sometimes God ask us for the
[1:07:20] ultimate brother Ron but I want peace
[1:07:23] and prosperity you showed up at the
[1:07:25] wrong place
[1:07:28] Place brother Ron I want everything to
[1:07:31] be
[1:07:32] good wrong
[1:07:35] war wrong
[1:07:40] war and he tells these
[1:07:43] men I want to buy this piece of
[1:07:47] property I want to buy
[1:07:49] Mella listen they didn't
[1:07:53] know what the significance of of him
[1:07:55] burying her there because it's in that
[1:07:59] property where there's going to come a
[1:08:01] resurrection amen he didn't want to just
[1:08:04] bury her in any
[1:08:06] church he just didn't want to bury her
[1:08:08] on any piece of property he wants to
[1:08:11] bury her where Jesus Christ is going to
[1:08:15] come
[1:08:16] alive listen don't bury me in some
[1:08:21] denomination don't you bury me in some
[1:08:24] denomination you bury me where he's
[1:08:26] going to raise up
[1:08:31] again Joseph said you you bury my bones
[1:08:34] down here Jacob said don't you bury my
[1:08:37] bones down here you carry my bones
[1:08:40] home carry them back to where Abraham
[1:08:43] said bury
[1:08:49] us and Abraham said oh no oh no I don't
[1:08:55] want I want you to give me the
[1:08:57] property cuz there'll always be a little
[1:09:00] something that you'll come back on me
[1:09:02] on now here's the pivotal part here
[1:09:05] comes the theme now don't you give it to
[1:09:08] me I'm willing to pay the price for it
[1:09:12] and they said bury your dad bury your
[1:09:15] dad bury your dead hey we're friends

[1:09:27] they ask him the ultimate
[1:09:31] price Inc magazine which is Inc magazine
[1:09:35] a Incorporated magazine says until
[1:09:39] today this is the highest piece of
[1:09:42] property ever

[1:21:05] there and say brother Ron thank
[1:21:09] youen I want to shake brother brandom's
[1:21:11] hand personally and tell him I did all
[1:21:13] that I could I believed it the best that
[1:21:16] I could I don't want to walk up and tell
[1:21:19] him I I you know I just did it when it
[1:21:21] was convenient
[1:21:25] is that all
[1:21:30] right brother brandham said the devil
[1:21:33] hates
[1:21:34] me and I know he hates you
[1:21:37] too he hates and he's my enemy but as
[1:21:42] long as God is my friend I don't have no
[1:21:44] fear of him that's right am I drive him
[1:21:47] right back and take the word of God and
[1:21:50] move him right on
[1:21:52] back and out of the place that he thinks
[1:21:55] that he's holding and he has got he
[1:21:57] hasn't got no strongholds he's
[1:22:00] absolutely legally fitted in every
[1:22:02] defeated in every place the devil hasn't
[1:22:06] got one legal right at all nowhere he's
[1:22:10] just a
[1:22:15] devil he's just a devil listen this is
[1:22:18] one of my favorite quote it's just
[1:22:21] cancer that's right
[1:22:25] why don't you put your greatest problem
[1:22:27] right
[1:22:29] here it's just
[1:22:34] depression come on come on let's hear it
[1:22:37] right now it's just
[1:22:40] cancer name your greatest problem right
[1:22:43] here's a good spot to do it so the devil
[1:22:48] knows
[1:22:51] sir he hasn't got no legal right to any
[1:22:54] man that'll accept the promise of Jesus
[1:22:56] Christ he's
[1:23:00] whipped he's whipped in sickness he's
[1:23:03] whipped in disappointments he's whipped
[1:23:05] in everything he's whipped in
[1:23:08] death he can't scare me he can't scare
[1:23:12] you that's all he is is a shadow
[1:23:26] Jesus would be at his
[1:23:32] weakest he would be at his
[1:23:37] weakest Connie would make me clean that
[1:23:40] up so I'm going to clean it
[1:23:48] up he was at his weakest now he's been
[1:23:53] baptized and now we know who he
[1:23:56] is brother Doug he fast for 40 days as a
[1:24:03] man he's at his
[1:24:06] weakest I think you've got a picture of
[1:24:08] that when he's at his
[1:24:13] weakest 40 days fast then the Devil
[1:24:16] Comes
[1:24:19] amen and the devil begins to make him an
[1:24:22] offer he don't just make brother brandom
[1:24:24] an offer and Moses an offer and you an
[1:24:28] offer listen he knows who Jesus
[1:24:32] is he's been watching his lineage he
[1:24:34] knows all the women that's come down
[1:24:36] through he's been watching him and now
[1:24:39] he gets baptized the devil was there too
[1:24:42] he comes to
[1:24:44] church he'll talk to you out of coming
[1:24:46] but he'll come
[1:24:50] with cuz you can feel him a lot of times
[1:24:52] he's right here but after the word
[1:24:53] preaching
[1:24:56] just I don't want to make him welcome I
[1:24:59] really don't want to make him
[1:25:02] welcome so he comes
[1:25:05] and now Jesus has purpose in his
[1:25:09] life now his purpose he came to the
[1:25:12] Earth on this coming to Die For You
[1:25:17] amen he come with one purpose in mind to
[1:25:21] heal you to save you and he come to die
[1:25:24] for
[1:25:25] you he's going to pay the ultimate cost
[1:25:29] let me just say as human beings none of
[1:25:31] us like
[1:25:34] rejection none of us like to be talked
[1:25:37] bad about none of us want to be
[1:25:40] hated but he come here for all of that
[1:25:43] to
[1:25:46] happen so Satan makes him an
[1:25:51] offer now he offers him the kingdoms of
[1:25:56] the
[1:25:57] world three offers he makes him the off
[1:26:00] he makes him an offer to be the kingdom
[1:26:04] of the world now brother brandham said I
[1:26:07] going to just take this one he even
[1:26:09] showed him the United States of
[1:26:13] America and all of her greatness to be
[1:26:15] king over us wouldn't that be great to
[1:26:18] have Jesus as king over us that'd be a
[1:26:21] lot better than what we've got an option
[1:26:23] on
[1:26:27] I think what a
[1:26:31] disgrace now here's what brother brandom
[1:26:33] said you don't have to take my word for
[1:26:36] it he said he was
[1:26:39] tempted to take
[1:26:43] it brother Ben Satan can make you offers
[1:26:47] that you in your human flesh if you
[1:26:49] don't have the Holy
[1:26:52] Ghost if you don't have the Hol Holy
[1:26:54] Ghost you'll be
[1:27:00] tempted tempted to take
[1:27:07] it now what is he doing he's offering
[1:27:10] him a kingdom without
[1:27:14] Calvary because Calvary is the ultimate
[1:27:18] price let me just say if he takes it me
[1:27:21] and you are still in bondage me and you
[1:27:24] are still in sin me and you have no
[1:27:27] right to the healing power of Jesus
[1:27:31] Christ the cancer that I fight let me
[1:27:35] just say this to you I can't stand and
[1:27:37] Proclaim Liberty if he takes the
[1:27:41] offer let me just say the amount of
[1:27:44] Temptation is the
[1:27:48] victory your Mount of Temptation is your
[1:27:52] victory
[1:27:55] [Applause]
[1:28:05] here's where the cost comes
[1:28:08] in when you turn him
[1:28:16] down well brother brand brother Ron what
[1:28:19] is it okay for a young person
