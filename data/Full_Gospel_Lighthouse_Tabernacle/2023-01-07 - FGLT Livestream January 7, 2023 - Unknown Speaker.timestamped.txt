[38:58] all week

[39:02] goodness I
[39:03] it just feels like the Lord is going to
[39:04] come at any moment doesn't it amen but I
[39:07] but we say let it be because that was
[39:09] you know the last testimony of the Bible
[39:10] was even so come Lord Jesus
[39:13] that is our hearts cry amen so certainly
[39:15] honored to be standing before you this
[39:18] evening to share the good news in this
[39:20] powerful message that we love and
[39:22] believe with all of our hearts I always
[39:24] certainly look forward to this time of
[39:26] year you know and just we all get to
[39:28] kind of speak to you at one time and
[39:29] certainly the lord always does something
[39:31] so special for us amen so we'll won't
[39:33] keep his standing if he'll turn with me
[39:35] to Numbers Chapter 20.
[39:38] verse 7.
[39:42] we'll begin reading don't you love the
[39:44] word of the Lord
[39:46] amen
[39:47] everything in life will fail our health
[39:50] will fell us our money will fail us our
[39:53] houses will fail us but he will never
[39:55] fail
[39:56] amen
[39:57] we'll begin reading here and the Lord
[39:59] spake unto Moses saying take the rod and
[40:03] gather thou the assembly together thou
[40:06] and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto
[40:08] the rock before their eyes
[40:12] and it shall give forth his water
[40:16] so here we have a rock that actually has
[40:19] a personal pronoun he didn't say speak
[40:22] to the Rock and it'll give forth it's
[40:24] water he said speak to the Rock and he
[40:26] will give forth his water
[40:29] and thou shall bring forth to them water
[40:31] out of the rock so shalt thou give the
[40:33] congregation and their beasts to drink
[40:35] and Moses took the rod from before the
[40:38] Lord
[40:39] as he commanded him and Moses and Aaron
[40:42] gather the congregation together before
[40:44] the Rock and he said unto them here now
[40:47] ye Rebels must we fetch you water out of
[40:50] this rock and Moses lifted up his hand
[40:53] and with his Rod he smote the what he
[40:57] smote The Rock twice
[40:59] and the water came out abundantly and
[41:02] the congregation drank and their Beast
[41:04] also also when we read First Corinthians
[41:07] chapter 10 and as you're flipping there
[41:09] we understand the prophet teaches us
[41:10] that when Moses struck this rock two
[41:13] million people
[41:14] plus and all of their cattle and their
[41:17] camels and everything they had drink
[41:19] this was not just a little trickle this
[41:21] was not like you may find in the forest
[41:23] somewhere here in the mountains but it
[41:25] was an absolute gusher that they drunk
[41:28] from in First Corinthians 10 verse 1
[41:30] moreover Brethren I would not that ye
[41:32] should be ignorant how that all of our
[41:35] fathers were under the cloud
[41:37] and all passed through the sea and we're
[41:39] all baptizing to Moses in the cloud and
[41:41] in the sea and did all eat the same
[41:43] spiritual meat and did all drink the
[41:46] same spiritual drink for they drank of
[41:49] that spiritual rock that followed them
[41:53] and that rock
[41:55] was Christ amen let's bow our heads the
[41:58] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[41:59] for this opportunity that we can come we
[42:01] can examine ourselves in the word father
[42:02] we just ask that you take complete
[42:04] control of the service father there's
[42:06] one thing Lord Jesus that I ask I ask
[42:08] that you help me get out of the way may
[42:10] you speak to our hearts may you listen
[42:11] father through us speak through us and
[42:13] we'll give you the praise
[42:14] honor and the glory in Jesus Christ's
[42:16] name amen amen God bless you as you're
[42:18] seated if I just titled just uh this
[42:21] briefly I would like to speak on that
[42:23] rock
[42:24] is Christ
[42:27] you know Moses had a lot to put up with
[42:29] when he was in the first Exodus there
[42:30] was a lot that he had to deal with he
[42:32] was responsible for two million people
[42:34] as I said and he had to trust God for
[42:37] the logistics
[42:39] of keeping these people fed and watered
[42:41] and happy and you know God did all of
[42:43] that yet they still always murmured and
[42:45] complained Moses was under a lot of
[42:47] pressure
[42:48] we understand that the prophet also
[42:50] teaches us that when Moses went to the
[42:52] Rock God told him to speak to the Rock
[42:54] there was an earlier time in their
[42:56] Journey where God told them to smoke to
[42:58] Smite it and he did it gave forth his
[42:59] water but this time Moses was to speak
[43:02] to the Rock
[43:03] for it to give forth his water and Moses
[43:06] went and he he got angry the anger got
[43:08] to him his temper did and he smote The
[43:11] Rock instead of speaking to it
[43:13] the scripture tells us that he smote The
[43:15] Rock twice so he smote it the first time
[43:17] and they didn't give forth water so he
[43:19] smote it again and brother Ram said that
[43:21] God that he Moses knew that he had power
[43:24] with God as a prophet so even though it
[43:26] wasn't God's perfect will that water had
[43:29] to come out of the Rock
[43:31] but you know the prophet tells us that
[43:33] was the only place in the scripture
[43:34] where the types were broken because
[43:36] Jesus Christ is that rock and he was
[43:39] only smitten once so because Moses did
[43:42] that he was not allowed to cross over
[43:44] into the promised land God had him he
[43:47] climbed up the mountains and Mount
[43:48] Pisgah I believe it was and he was able
[43:50] to climb up the mountain
[43:52] pretty good for 120 year old man isn't
[43:54] it he climbed up the mountain and he was
[43:56] able to look off in the distance and he
[43:58] could see that everything that God had
[44:01] promised them everything that he said
[44:02] would come to pass he could look right
[44:05] over and he could see it
[44:07] he could see the Fulfillment of God's
[44:09] word but he was not allowed to actually
[44:12] cross over because of his disobedience
[44:16] now it's important to understand
[44:18] that Moses was not allowed to physically
[44:21] enter into that land but Moses did enter
[44:24] that land
[44:25] because 800 six 800 years later he was
[44:28] seen talking to Jesus Christ
[44:31] Moses did not die the Paul the Bible
[44:34] said that it died but the Angels came
[44:35] and took him away and he appeared on
[44:37] Mount Transfiguration to Jesus and
[44:40] strengthening him and tell and talking
[44:41] to Jesus rather having a conference with
[44:44] God
[44:45] and then 3000 years later he's still in
[44:48] the he comes back to the promised land
[44:50] and he literally goes to the promised
[44:52] land brother Fred and he's with Elijah
[44:54] and he's preaching Jesus Christ to the
[44:57] Jews
[44:59] so how much better of a promised land
[45:01] that because Israel went over and they
[45:04] begin to lose land because of unbelief
[45:06] they ended up getting carried away to
[45:08] Babylon but here Moses has the
[45:10] opportunity to present the real promised
[45:13] land to the Jews all these thousands of
[45:15] years later that's what we're waiting on
[45:17] that's what the Jews are waiting on the
[45:19] Jews are waiting on Moses and Elijah to
[45:22] return to present this same message this
[45:25] same gospel that we believe is going to
[45:27] go to the Jews and Moses even though he
[45:31] couldn't cross it in the natural was now
[45:33] able then now in our day he will cross
[45:36] it and he'll be there in the natural
[45:38] but most importantly he'll be presenting
[45:41] it to the Jews in the spiritual it will
[45:44] be he will present he will he will bring
[45:46] his people over into the promised land
[45:49] which is Jesus Christ that is the real
[45:52] promised land is the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:57] so Moses will still be there
[46:00] God has a reason and a purpose for
[46:02] everything
[46:03] because when Moses Was preparing today
[46:05] remember he climbed the mountain and he
[46:07] seen the promised land of far off the
[46:09] Old Testament Saints and all the church
[46:10] age Saints what did the Bible tell us
[46:12] that they've seen that they seen the
[46:14] promises of God are far off but weren't
[46:16] able to go over
[46:18] they weren't able to take a Rapture like
[46:20] we can they weren't able to to take a
[46:23] body change like will be but they
[46:25] believed it and they seen it afar off
[46:28] now in The Exodus many times when we
[46:30] think of The Exodus
[46:32] we think of the pillar of fire that led
[46:34] them by night and we think of the pillar
[46:36] of the cloud that led them by day but
[46:38] you know there was also a rock
[46:40] and this rock literally followed them
[46:44] they say how does a rock follow people
[46:47] that's a paradox
[46:50] how does a cow eat green grass and give
[46:52] white milk
[46:54] how does a man stop the Sun
[46:57] how does the biggest oak tree you've
[46:58] ever seen start as a Little Acorn
[47:02] in the message of leadership the prophet
[47:04] said in the Bible you know there was a
[47:06] rock that went with Israel and when
[47:08] Moses got ready to die he stepped up on
[47:10] this rock and that rock was Jesus
[47:13] you remember when Jesus was talking in
[47:15] Saint John the sixth chapter he said
[47:17] well our fathers eat man in the
[47:19] wilderness he said your father gave my
[47:21] father gave you that Manna he said yeah
[47:23] they ate that manner that's right but
[47:25] they're everyone dead because they
[47:27] couldn't keep going on see they're
[47:30] everyone dead but he said I am the bread
[47:31] of life that came down from heaven our
[47:34] fathers drank from a rock Moses smote
[47:36] The Rock and said the waters came forth
[47:38] he said I am
[47:40] that rock that was with him
[47:43] and look when Moses died he stepped on
[47:46] that rock
[47:47] you know what happened the Bible said
[47:49] the Angels came and got him
[47:52] that rock was there for Moses when he
[47:54] when he when the the children of Israel
[47:56] follow the children of Israel Moses got
[47:57] ready to die that rock was there
[48:04] on the way on if they came he says into
[48:06] the smitten Rock notice when they come
[48:09] to the Rock they had need now Moses
[48:11] smote the rock with the rod that's where
[48:13] we left last night smoked the rock with
[48:16] the rod and the rod was God's judgment
[48:18] Rod he smoked the Rock and there was a
[48:20] cleft on the left side of The Rock when
[48:23] the children of Israel got hungry they
[48:25] went there
[48:26] remember Christ is that rock
[48:28] and the Beehive a bee had got in there
[48:31] and they made a hive and they got honey
[48:32] out of the rock everything they had need
[48:35] of was in The Rock
[48:38] The Rock followed the church and The
[48:40] Rock was Christ Jesus when they were
[48:42] thirsty they drank from The Rock when
[48:44] they were hungry they ate from The Rock
[48:46] wherever they went the rock followed
[48:49] them
[48:51] because remember it was a journey
[48:54] so they couldn't if if that rock was in
[48:56] a just in one spot and could never move
[49:00] they'll be tied down
[49:02] but the rock follow them
[49:05] in the Lord Jesus Christ the angels of
[49:07] God are with you right
[49:10] wherever they went the rock followed
[49:12] them and the Rocks still following the
[49:14] church Christ is the rock that was in
[49:17] the wilderness notice now then that same
[49:20] Rock
[49:23] all you have to do is go to the cleft of
[49:26] The Rock
[49:27] the stronger the storm get in the cleft
[49:32] because he's your shelter
[49:35] and sometimes you know you're you're in
[49:37] you're under shelter and it's a bad
[49:38] storm and your feet may still be getting
[49:40] wet there's a gust of wind so if the
[49:42] storm is getting worse get in the cleft
[49:44] even more
[49:46] get in the cleft of the rock for the
[49:49] shelter from your storms
[49:51] and God not only has a shelter from your
[49:53] storm he's got a little treat in there
[49:55] for you while you're in there and
[49:57] there's Honey in the Rock my brother and
[50:00] my sister
[50:01] when you're in a storm you get in the
[50:04] cliff and you reach up there and you
[50:05] need some strength for the journey you
[50:08] say Lord here's some Honey in the Rock
[50:10] but you've got to get to the rock for
[50:12] your honey you've got to get to the rock
[50:14] for your shelter you don't get in the
[50:16] Rock you'll get struck by the storm
[50:19] but that cleft came from a striking a
[50:22] smiting
[50:23] and I left a cleft in the rock
[50:26] and you will find
[50:28] the sweetness of the Lord Jesus
[50:32] while you're taking shelter in the cleft
[50:36] that's where you learn about how sweet
[50:38] your lord Jesus is
[50:39] when the storm's going on when things
[50:41] are going good you're believing God and
[50:43] you're on the mountain and there's Faith
[50:45] but when you've got to get into that
[50:46] cleft and you're hearing the storm go by
[50:49] that's when you're thankful for that
[50:50] rock that's when you're thankful for
[50:52] that shelter that's when you're thankful
[50:54] and you reach up there and you get honey
[50:55] and you find full satisfaction and you
[50:58] know that honey never goes bad
[51:01] do you know that honey never ever has an
[51:03] expiration date on it you can eat honey
[51:05] it preserves itself this word children
[51:09] of God does not expire this word never
[51:12] goes bad you just reach in there you're
[51:15] in the cleft of the Rock You Reach in
[51:18] there and you grab you a promise if
[51:19] you're sick and then he got to touch you
[51:22] you reach up there and you grab some
[51:23] healing you're down you lost a loved one
[51:26] or you need some comforting you reach in
[51:28] there and get it it's for you
[51:31] praise the Lord
[51:33] now Moses literally struck The Rock
[51:36] they literally drank from it you we
[51:38] cannot over spiritualize things
[51:41] you've got to understand when something
[51:42] is natural and you've got to understand
[51:44] when something is spiritual
[51:47] there is a that was a literal Rock
[51:50] Jesus Christ is literally coming
[51:53] he spiritually came
[51:55] but now he's going to literally come
[51:58] our souls are in a raptured condition
[52:00] spiritually but we're going to literally
[52:02] be changed we are literally going to be
[52:06] missing we are literally going to be
[52:09] caught up in the air to meet him in the
[52:11] clouds it will be a literal coming
[52:15] now there's a spiritual coming and we
[52:17] preach about that all the time but we're
[52:19] also but don't forget there's a literal
[52:21] coming
[52:24] so this rock that is Christ Jesus begins
[52:28] to condescend from an actual rock it
[52:30] then becomes prophecy and then it
[52:32] becomes flesh
[52:35] in Isaiah 20 16 therefore thus saith the
[52:38] Lord
[52:39] God behold I lay in Zion for a
[52:42] foundation a stone a tried Stone a
[52:45] precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation
[52:47] he that believeth shall not make haste
[52:52] now in the scriptures we all know who
[52:53] Nebuchadnezzar was he had a dream and
[52:56] this dream bothered him so bad when he
[52:59] could not get the interpretation he was
[53:00] ready to kill every wise man in his
[53:02] kingdom
[53:04] because they had no interpretation for
[53:06] the dream
[53:07] but there was a man that had the
[53:09] interpretation the spirit of God lived
[53:11] in a man to give him that interpretation
[53:14] so in Daniel chapter 2 verse 34 is as
[53:17] because the the dream if you remember to
[53:19] give them a chance to pull it up there
[53:20] Daniel 2 34. remember the dream even
[53:24] left Nebuchadnezzar
[53:26] he couldn't even remember what he
[53:27] dreamed but if he heard it
[53:30] he would know what he'd dreamed so that
[53:32] Daniel begins to tell the king exactly
[53:35] what he dreamed
[53:37] and then he begins to say in verse 34
[53:39] thou sawest till a stone
[53:41] till that a stone was cut out without
[53:45] hands
[53:46] man had nothing to do with it
[53:48] which smote the image on his feet that
[53:51] were of iron and clay and break them to
[53:52] pieces that then was the iron the clay
[53:55] the brass the silver the gold broke into
[53:56] pieces together and became like the
[53:58] chaff of the summer threshing floor
[54:01] and the wind carried them away that no
[54:03] place was found for them and the stone
[54:05] that smoked the image became a great
[54:08] mountain and filled the whole earth
[54:11] that's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[54:14] because remember a stone is a revelation
[54:16] and it not only smote the image on the
[54:20] foot
[54:21] but it then grew and it began to fill
[54:23] the whole Earth this great Mountain that
[54:26] man had nothing to do with
[54:28] because remember each kingdom literally
[54:30] historically represented something the
[54:34] gold the silver the brass the thousands
[54:36] that went down because remember that
[54:38] Satan's kingdoms of the world is going
[54:40] from the head to the toes God builds his
[54:42] kingdom from the feet to the Head
[54:45] so as they're coming down this rock
[54:49] that's cut out without hands begin
[54:51] rolling down smites this huge image in
[54:55] the feet it falls
[54:57] just goes to dust and yet this mountain
[55:00] just grows and covers the whole earth
[55:02] have a cook 214 says in the Earth shall
[55:05] be filled with a knowledge of the glory
[55:07] of the Lord as the waters cover the sea
[55:11] have you ever been to the ocean and you
[55:13] look and it's so far that the ocean
[55:15] sister Heather touches the sky
[55:18] it's so as far as you can see it's the
[55:21] ocean
[55:21] that's how the glory and the knowledge
[55:23] of the Lord shall cover
[55:25] the Earth
[55:27] we're going to that kind of kingdom
[55:30] aren't you tired of this world and the
[55:32] politics and everything that it has I'm
[55:34] ready to go to a kingdom I'm ready to go
[55:36] to that place that's where I want to go
[55:38] where we don't have to worry about none
[55:40] of this anymore no more sickness No More
[55:42] Tears no more crying
[55:47] Zechariah 4 there's another prophecy as
[55:49] it's coming down 4-6 then he answered
[55:52] and speaking to me saying this is the
[55:53] word of the Lord unto the rubble saying
[55:55] not by power not not by might nor by
[55:58] power but by my spit Spirit saith the
[56:01] Lord of hosts who art thou old gray
[56:03] Mountain before zerubbabel thou shall
[56:05] become a plane
[56:07] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[56:11] therefore with shoutings crying Grace
[56:13] Grace unto it do you know that this
[56:16] message that you and I believe is a
[56:18] message of Grace
[56:19] that is the message of the hour that has
[56:21] come despite all of our mistakes and all
[56:23] of our Mix-Ups and everywhere where life
[56:25] has put us everywhere where our wrong
[56:27] choices have put us yet there's a double
[56:29] measure of Grace that is given to you
[56:32] and it's actually Christ it's not crying
[56:34] judgment it's crying Grace Grace like
[56:36] that woman that was caught in adultery
[56:38] remember the the law was crying out
[56:40] judgment but there withstood The
[56:42] Headstone
[56:44] himself
[56:45] and what did he cry Grace Grace unto her
[56:50] is crying great this is a message of
[56:52] Grace this isn't a message of
[56:54] Commandments and a message of do's and
[56:57] don'ts I can't do this and I wish I
[56:58] could but I can't
[56:59] this is freedom
[57:02] if this message ain't Freedom nothing is
[57:05] if this ain't it then nothing is
[57:08] The Headstone is Christ himself and the
[57:10] body of Christ shapes up the same
[57:13] Ministry and the acts of the church
[57:16] exactly as Jesus was
[57:18] because remember when The Headstone is
[57:20] Christ he's both Cornerstone and he's
[57:23] headstone he's Alpha he's Omega he's the
[57:26] beginning he's the end he's a root he's
[57:28] The Offspring
[57:29] so when The Headstone comes down
[57:31] remember have you all seen that chart
[57:33] that brother Ram drew the statue of a
[57:34] perfect man that is a type oh that is
[57:37] also the body of Christ as it's being
[57:39] built up The Headstone if you notice has
[57:41] got to fit
[57:43] the rest of the pyramid perfectly
[57:45] brother Ram said it was the grooves had
[57:47] to fit perfectly
[57:48] so the Capstone could not have come in
[57:50] the days of Luther it wouldn't have fit
[57:52] the the top of the pyramid without the
[57:54] Capstone that had been like the Capstone
[57:56] trying to sit on this it don't fit well
[57:59] as Wesley came and got a little closer
[58:01] as the Pentecostals came and got a
[58:02] little closer but now
[58:05] the Capstone is here
[58:07] the Capstone is Jesus Christ
[58:10] the fullness of the word
[58:14] I love this here he said
[58:16] but now as she begins to heat to the top
[58:19] each one of these Stones coming from
[58:21] Luther Methodist Pentecost then the
[58:23] church will have to get in such a place
[58:25] when the real Stone headstone comes
[58:28] it'll fit right joint to joint with it
[58:31] like I said last night in the Covenant
[58:33] the church will have to have the spirit
[58:36] of God in it so so much
[58:40] till that spirit will be doing the same
[58:42] works that Jesus Christ did here on
[58:44] Earth the Holy Ghost having complete
[58:46] control before that woman the church
[58:48] could ever Unite with her husband the
[58:51] bride
[58:52] grandchildren will never see that
[58:54] they'll say I'm Pentecostal that's all
[58:56] and go on
[58:58] it's got to be a personal experience
[59:01] because remember the Cornerstone and The
[59:02] Headstone both tie the structure
[59:04] together
[59:05] the Cornerstone will start you outright
[59:08] and The Headstone will tell you if you
[59:10] if you got it right
[59:12] remember you get off just a little bit
[59:14] by the time you end up way over there
[59:16] you are way off
[59:18] so it's got to be so perfect you know
[59:20] the Great Pyramid in Egypt still don't
[59:23] have a headstone
[59:25] it literally does not have a headstone
[59:28] and they're arguing about why they think
[59:30] it was stolen maybe it was this maybe it
[59:32] was that
[59:33] but we know why it doesn't have a
[59:35] headstone because Jesus Christ was
[59:37] rejected and he's the headstone
[59:40] now I love this here he said in the
[59:42] message Israel in the church and The
[59:43] Rock's still following the church Christ
[59:46] is the rock that was in the wilderness
[59:47] now notice that same Rock no wonder when
[59:50] he came into Jerusalem brother Ron read
[59:52] this last Sunday the scripture
[59:54] that he's referenced they said make him
[59:57] hold their peace make them hold their
[59:59] peace he said if they hold their peace
[1:00:02] the Rocks stones will immediately cry
[1:00:05] out
[1:00:07] the prophet said what was it the Chief
[1:00:10] Cornerstone was come
[1:00:13] rolling down among the stones something
[1:00:15] had to take place rocks were crying out
[1:00:20] what are we so excited about is because
[1:00:22] the headstone has come down and all of
[1:00:25] us Lively stones are crying out to him
[1:00:28] because he's a chief headstone he's the
[1:00:31] Chief Cornerstone beginning to end he's
[1:00:33] everything
[1:00:35] without him you have nothing
[1:00:38] with him you have everything
[1:00:42] now now this right here is something is
[1:00:46] an architectural quote they especially
[1:00:48] did this in more older engineering but
[1:00:51] it said in relation to architecture
[1:00:53] a Cornerstone is traditionally the first
[1:00:56] stone laid for a structure
[1:00:59] with all other Stones laid in reference
[1:01:02] a Cornerstone marks the geographical
[1:01:04] location by orienting a building in a
[1:01:08] specific Direction
[1:01:11] and Jesus Christ is the Chief
[1:01:12] Cornerstone and he's orienting us up
[1:01:17] first Peter 2 5. he also as Lively
[1:01:20] stones are built up a spiritual house
[1:01:22] you are a spiritual house
[1:01:24] We Gather in this physical church
[1:01:27] building but you are actually the church
[1:01:29] the bride Across the Nation around the
[1:01:32] world Lively stones that is why no one
[1:01:36] can take your place
[1:01:37] when God is building a building he's got
[1:01:39] a place for you this one he's got a
[1:01:41] place for that one he's got a place for
[1:01:42] that one he don't need no tools he don't
[1:01:44] need no works of man he cuts you exactly
[1:01:47] by the spoken word you come to church
[1:01:49] and you and maybe we're getting a little
[1:01:51] loose about certain things in life and
[1:01:53] these brothers get up here and they
[1:01:55] preach the word or in the anoint you of
[1:01:56] the Holy Spirit some stuff gets shaved
[1:01:58] off
[1:02:00] they don't do that
[1:02:02] they don't do that it's the power of the
[1:02:05] spoken word where conviction happens and
[1:02:07] you go out Lord I didn't realize I was
[1:02:09] doing that forgive me help me shake me
[1:02:12] mold me make me and that God don't have
[1:02:14] sauce
[1:02:15] God don't just cut you you don't once
[1:02:17] they were building Solomon's Temple you
[1:02:19] didn't hear tools
[1:02:21] it came from all over the world and
[1:02:23] everything fitly joined together
[1:02:27] so between the alpha Cornerstone and the
[1:02:30] Omega headstone are all you Lively
[1:02:32] stones
[1:02:33] are all you Lively Stones all over the
[1:02:35] internet
[1:02:38] Romans 8 29 called him the firstborn
[1:02:40] among many brethren
[1:02:42] he's the first fruits of them that slept
[1:02:44] he's the first begotten of the Dead
[1:02:46] because remember this has this message
[1:02:48] is a headstone message not a Reformation
[1:02:50] this isn't just a movement
[1:02:53] throughout history they've been little
[1:02:54] movements little Sparks little revivals
[1:02:56] that that would like the Welsh Revival
[1:02:58] and different things
[1:03:00] genuine moves of the spirit that God
[1:03:01] would use God would put souls in the
[1:03:03] kingdom of God this is an actual this is
[1:03:06] the presentation of Jesus Christ himself
[1:03:08] to the bride
[1:03:10] this is God's love message to you
[1:03:14] this is a Rapture message
[1:03:17] when Jesus came he was speaking in type
[1:03:19] about building a house on a rock
[1:03:21] he said therefore in Matthew 7 whosoever
[1:03:23] heareth these things of mine and doeth
[1:03:25] them that's a big and right there
[1:03:29] I will liken him into a wise man which
[1:03:31] built his house upon a rock now is Jesus
[1:03:34] just storytelling and just wasting
[1:03:36] people's time
[1:03:38] he's that rock
[1:03:42] and the rain descended remember being in
[1:03:44] the cleft of The Rock and the floods
[1:03:45] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[1:03:47] that house and it fell not for it was
[1:03:50] founded
[1:03:51] upon a rock
[1:03:55] but you remember the foolish man built
[1:03:57] his house in sand
[1:03:59] so what is sand anything other than this
[1:04:03] anything
[1:04:06] because remember he's that rock of
[1:04:07] Revelation
[1:04:09] Iraq is the type of Revelation when he
[1:04:11] came and he asked Peter whom do men say
[1:04:13] that I the son of man am
[1:04:15] he said some say you're you're John the
[1:04:17] Baptist or rose from the dead or you're
[1:04:19] Jeremiah or you're one of the prophets
[1:04:20] and then Jesus brings it right right to
[1:04:22] him
[1:04:23] and he says but whom say ye that I am
[1:04:27] what do you say about this message
[1:04:29] some people say oh the Miracles were
[1:04:31] good oh he went off brother and went off
[1:04:34] at the at the latter end oh this that or
[1:04:36] the other what do you say about this
[1:04:37] message
[1:04:39] and whenever you get that Revelation
[1:04:41] that rock which is Christ himself in
[1:04:43] your heart to say that this is the
[1:04:45] message this is Jesus Christ
[1:04:47] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:04:51] then he can build upon that
[1:04:54] and Jesus told them Thou Art Peter and
[1:04:55] Upon This Rock
[1:04:57] the rock of the revelation of who he was
[1:05:00] not upon Peter
[1:05:02] but literally upon Peter's understanding
[1:05:04] of who Jesus was because the churches of
[1:05:07] the day called him the devil
[1:05:09] but here you have an ignorant fisherman
[1:05:12] who said
[1:05:14] you're certainly not a devil
[1:05:16] and you're not even one of the prophets
[1:05:18] as flattering as that may be
[1:05:21] but you're literally the Messiah you are
[1:05:23] literally the son of God
[1:05:27] and he was blessed for that
[1:05:30] the woman at the well
[1:05:32] she was thirsty
[1:05:34] and she'd come to this well every single
[1:05:36] day for water
[1:05:38] and one day The Rock was there
[1:05:42] the same Rock
[1:05:44] was waiting for her
[1:05:47] now you notice whenever she whenever
[1:05:49] whenever she came she didn't Smite him
[1:05:53] like all them people did at his
[1:05:54] crucifixion and jerked handfuls of beard
[1:05:57] out of his face she spoke to him
[1:06:01] and as she was beginning to speak to him
[1:06:03] what did it do
[1:06:05] The Rock gave forth his water
[1:06:10] she began to speak to him and the water
[1:06:13] just came out it wasn't just a trickle
[1:06:15] just to help her be a better person
[1:06:18] it was a gusher
[1:06:20] it was such a gusher that she had
[1:06:22] something to give out she ran into the
[1:06:24] City and said come see a man who's told
[1:06:26] me everything I've ever done isn't this
[1:06:28] a very Messiah she spoke to the Rock
[1:06:31] and they gave forth his water
[1:06:34] Jesus stood one day and he cried the
[1:06:36] Bible says if any man thirsts let him
[1:06:39] come unto me and drink
[1:06:43] when Jesus came and he went all the way
[1:06:44] to the cross
[1:06:47] he had a he had a price to pay
[1:06:50] he had to pay for your soul and he had
[1:06:51] to pay for my soul
[1:06:53] so Jesus had to go on the cross so that
[1:06:56] he could be smitten
[1:06:58] he literally had to be smitten so when
[1:07:01] he was on the cross and he said it was
[1:07:03] finished and a Roman literally remember
[1:07:05] not spiritualizing it a Roman literally
[1:07:07] took a
[1:07:09] spear
[1:07:10] put it up to his side and sister Julia
[1:07:14] literally pushed it into his eye
[1:07:20] and he gave out
[1:07:23] the elements of the new birth
[1:07:26] at that moment he made possible the new
[1:07:29] birth
[1:07:32] Rock of Ages
[1:07:34] Cliff for me
[1:07:37] let me hide
[1:07:39] myself in the
[1:07:42] let the water
[1:07:45] and the blood
[1:07:47] from thy wounded side
[1:07:50] which flowed
[1:07:52] be of sin
[1:07:54] a double cure
[1:07:57] Grace Grace
[1:08:00] save from Wrath
[1:08:02] and make me pure
[1:08:06] and then Jesus said it is finished
[1:08:10] everything that you have need of was
[1:08:12] taken care of
[1:08:13] your healing Brother Andy was taken care
[1:08:16] of your healing brother wrong was taken
[1:08:18] care of brother Donnie
[1:08:19] every knee that was that is here
[1:08:21] represented here
[1:08:23] was taken care of
[1:08:26] so now if you need the Holy Ghost
[1:08:31] tell them what you want
[1:08:34] don't Smite him you don't have to to try
[1:08:36] so hard and be to him
[1:08:38] just tell him what you want
[1:08:40] if you need salvation
[1:08:43] tell them what you want
[1:08:47] good
[1:08:49] after his resurrection remember Thomas
[1:08:51] was there
[1:08:53] and I find it interesting in the
[1:08:54] scripture when Thomas said except I see
[1:08:57] in his hands the print of the nails and
[1:08:59] put my finger in the print of his nails
[1:09:01] Jesus was not there
[1:09:03] but Jesus still hurt him
[1:09:05] because when Jesus appeared to him
[1:09:07] he said Thomas
[1:09:11] and Jesus wasn't there but he heard his
[1:09:13] very words
[1:09:15] and then Thomas believed
[1:09:22] closing I want to say this
[1:09:25] speak to the Rock
[1:09:28] he has everything that we have need of
[1:09:32] he's your shelter
[1:09:34] he's your food
[1:09:37] he's your protection
[1:09:40] he is literally
[1:09:42] everything that you have need of
[1:09:45] if you're staying out want to read it
[1:09:47] from The Book of Psalms and go through
[1:09:48] several several verses here
[1:09:51] in Psalm 18 verse 1 I will love thee O
[1:09:55] Lord my strength
[1:09:57] the Lord is my rock in my Fortress my
[1:10:01] deliverer my God my strength in him will
[1:10:04] I trust my buckler in the Horn of my
[1:10:06] salvation in my high tower
[1:10:09] Psalm 18 31 for who is God save the Lord
[1:10:12] or who is a rock
[1:10:14] Save Our God
[1:10:17] Psalm 1846 the Lord liveth
[1:10:20] and blessed be my rock
[1:10:23] can you say he's my rock
[1:10:26] and let the god of my salvation
[1:10:29] be exalted
[1:10:31] make it personal
[1:10:34] Psalm 27 5 for in the time of trouble he
[1:10:37] shall hide me
[1:10:38] remember that cleft of the Rock in the
[1:10:41] time of trouble he shall hide me
[1:10:44] in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[1:10:47] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[1:10:49] me upon a rock
[1:10:53] in Psalm 42 he had brought me up also
[1:10:56] out of an horrible pit and out of the
[1:10:57] Maori clay and set my feet upon a rock
[1:11:01] and establish my goings Psalm 61 from
[1:11:04] the end of the Earth will I cry unto
[1:11:06] thee when my heart is overwhelmed
[1:11:10] what beautiful words
[1:11:12] when your heart is overwhelmed and you
[1:11:14] literally don't even have the words to
[1:11:15] pray
[1:11:17] then lead me to the rock that is higher
[1:11:20] than I
[1:11:21] for thou has been a shelter for me and a
[1:11:25] strong tower
[1:11:26] from the enemy
[1:11:29] Psalm 62 2 he only is my rock and my
[1:11:33] salvation he is my defense I shall not
[1:11:36] be greatly moved Psalm 71 3 be thou my
[1:11:40] strong habitation where unto you I may
[1:11:42] continue to Resort thou has given
[1:11:44] commandment to save me for thou art my
[1:11:47] rock and my Fortress
[1:11:50] Psalm 95 1.
[1:11:52] let's say all this together I'll give
[1:11:54] him a chance to pull it up Psalm 95 1.
[1:11:58] aren't you thankful for the rock of your
[1:12:00] salvation when your heart is overwhelmed
[1:12:03] you can go into the cleft of The Rock

[1:20:33] hey man that is exactly is exactly what
[1:20:36] we have seen in this generation is The
[1:20:38] Rock has come down and that is
[1:20:40] Revelations 10 and it is exactly what
[1:20:43] William Branham was laying there in bed
[1:20:45] when he was considering and laying have
[1:20:47] I ever done anything in life have I've
[1:20:49] done anything remember what he said
[1:20:51] you'll remember if you'll go studying
[1:20:53] out in 1962 when he preaches to us
[1:20:55] serves is this a sign of the end he said
[1:20:57] my Bible was open to Romans chapter 9
[1:20:59] and verse 33 behold I lay in Zion a
[1:21:02] stumbling song that whosoever believeth
[1:21:04] on him shall never be ashamed and I
[1:21:07] think it's pretty profound that the
[1:21:08] angel had the whole you can lay out your
[1:21:10] whole entire Bible and there's there's
[1:21:12] thousands maybe maybe not thousands but
[1:21:14] a couple hundred scriptures that are
[1:21:15] laying there but this this Bible was
[1:21:18] opened up to Romans 9 33. it was a
[1:21:21] statement to the Church of the Living
[1:21:22] God I am laying this message right in
[1:21:25] front of you and whosoever believe it
[1:21:27] shall not be ashamed I certainly
[1:21:29] appreciated that brother William we we
[1:21:32] certainly we certainly really
[1:21:33] appreciated that very much very much
[1:21:44] we before we go forward tonight we we
[1:21:47] always enjoy these these type of
[1:21:49] services that we have around New Year's
[1:21:52] and we were unable to have it last
[1:21:54] weekend due to all of the business of
[1:21:56] things of ordination of deacons and and
[1:22:00] things of that nature and communion and
[1:22:02] why didn't we have a time last weekend
[1:22:05] I I I've had a hard time getting over it
[1:22:08] all week long physically and spiritually
[1:22:10] and I don't think I'll ever get over it
[1:22:12] spiritually and and uh just I tell you
[1:22:16] I've never I've been in some very
[1:22:18] special spots and I think that something
[1:22:20] that we're very acquainted with is the
[1:22:21] presence of the Lord and the names of
[1:22:23] the Lord slipping by but I I personally
[1:22:25] have never been a part of anything
[1:22:27] quite like what went on here last
[1:22:30] weekend and I've never heard so many
[1:22:32] voices uh speaking in tongues all at the
[1:22:35] same time and it was just I believe that
[1:22:38] this is the final sweep of the Holy
[1:22:40] Ghost and and
[1:22:43] um just want to make this mention I'm
[1:22:45] going to ask sister Whitney if she'll
[1:22:46] come help me sing a song and I got a
[1:22:49] purpose in singing this song tonight
[1:22:50] hopefully hopefully I can take my 25
[1:22:53] minutes and get to the point that I want
[1:22:54] to but uh if not I got y'all next
[1:22:58] weekend or the weekend after that so uh
[1:23:02] but we want to be remembering sister
[1:23:04] Erica Parker that I believe it's this
[1:23:06] coming week that she'll be going to take
[1:23:08] her next treatment and so we just want
[1:23:10] to be remembering that and and uh
[1:23:15] I believe the Lord's getting ready to do
[1:23:16] something very special and uh
[1:23:20] singing song The Blessing sister Whitney
[1:23:27] probably shouldn't say this before he
[1:23:28] was saying I'm going to
[1:23:31] uh
[1:23:32] you'll understand if I say it I may not
[1:23:35] get it back together up here but
[1:23:38] um
[1:23:39] I believe there's I believe there's
[1:23:40] prophecy
[1:23:42] I standing before us tonight
[1:23:45] amen and it's you
[1:23:48] and I believe that I believe that they
[1:23:51] are his power I believe there's power in
[1:23:53] our words
[1:23:54] and uh two years ago
[1:23:57] two years ago
[1:24:03] I had a very special night with my
[1:24:05] family and uh I'll just say the angel of
[1:24:08] the Lord got in the car
[1:24:09] and uh
[1:24:12] he uh
[1:24:14] he spoke something uh sister Whitney
[1:24:17] I said never been drunk in your life
[1:24:19] but you're going to experience it it
[1:24:22] took two years for that to come to
[1:24:23] fruition but last weekend we carried
[1:24:25] sister weekend sister Whitney me and
[1:24:28] brother Davey carried her in she was so
[1:24:30] drunk on the Holy Ghost
[1:24:33] I believe that God is here and I believe
[1:24:36] that
[1:24:37] if you have a desire for anything
[1:24:39] tonight I know he'll meet your need he
[1:24:43] knows why you come here tonight

[1:33:45] I was asked to send this quote to
[1:33:48] somebody today my brother Bynum said
[1:33:50] when he was preaching in 1961 he was
[1:33:53] preaching the revelation of chat uh The
[1:33:56] Book of Revelations chapter 4 chapter 5.
[1:33:58] and he got to going down through there
[1:34:00] he said when those seals are released he
[1:34:02] said everything must be worshiped then
[1:34:05] you are standing in the greatest hour
[1:34:07] that you've ever been standing in the
[1:34:10] book is open the seals have been
[1:34:12] released it's worship it's a Time To
[1:34:15] Worship it's a time to praise the word
[1:34:18] has been revealed
[1:34:22] and we're the ones that do it Hallelujah
[1:34:28] Hallelujah
[1:34:29] [Music]
[1:34:34] Hallelujah
[1:34:36] Hallelujah
[1:34:38] [Music]
[1:34:40] Hallelujah
[1:34:41] [Music]
[1:34:53] thank you
[1:34:55] [Music]
[1:34:56] Hallelujah
[1:35:06] Hallelujah
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:13] Hallelujah
[1:35:16] this is the Lord's daughter
[1:35:26] behold I lay inside
[1:35:30] our stumbling Stone
[1:35:32] many of us stumbled at this storm
[1:35:35] many have stumbled at this message
[1:35:38] but whosoever believeth in him
[1:35:41] shall never
[1:35:44] the president's on your case whether the
[1:35:47] boss is on your case where Satan is on
[1:35:49] your case it doesn't matter
[1:35:51] shall never
[1:35:53] be ashamed
[1:35:56] I'm not ashamed of this rock I'm not
[1:35:59] ashamed of this message
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:04] Hallelujah
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:08] well I won't take much longer
[1:36:12] but I do want to say something
[1:36:16] so if you have your Bibles and I know I
[1:36:18] know it's hard to gather yourself but
[1:36:20] this is this is about worship and it's
[1:36:22] about sacrifice
[1:36:25] and that's the greatest thing in worship
[1:36:27] is knowing how to sacrifice
[1:36:32] completely giving myself over
[1:36:38] that's what makes it worship
[1:36:41] because anybody can praise when they got
[1:36:43] shoes on their feet
[1:36:45] anybody can praise when they got bread
[1:36:47] on their table
[1:36:49] but worship is when you ain't got no
[1:36:51] shoes
[1:36:52] worship is when you ain't got no bread
[1:36:55] worship is when you ain't got no money
[1:37:00] worship
[1:37:02] is the heart of the father
[1:37:05] Matthew chapter 3 and verse 15 and
[1:37:17] God does all things
[1:37:19] well
[1:37:21] Matthew chapter 3 and verse 15 and just
[1:37:23] one just one scripture
[1:37:25] for this evening and
[1:37:32] we're going to have some baptisms
[1:37:34] tonight after after the service and I
[1:37:37] know that
[1:37:39] we're not accustomed to holding you too
[1:37:41] long but it seems like the Lord keeps
[1:37:43] rolling the time back on us a little bit
[1:37:45] so I hope that's okay
[1:37:48] this is my highlight of the week so
[1:37:51] not me preaching but being in church
[1:37:56] I'm not that carnal
[1:37:59] Matthew chapter 3 and verse 15 and Jesus
[1:38:02] answering said unto them suffer it to be
[1:38:06] so now for thus it becometh us to
[1:38:09] fulfill all righteousness then he
[1:38:12] suffered him may God bless his word he
[1:38:14] may be seated tonight and before we
[1:38:17] before we go on I'd like to pray as a
[1:38:19] congregation for sister Erica Parker as
[1:38:22] she goes forward brother Ron has test
[1:38:24] this coming week in the next coming week
[1:38:26] so we'll just I know you're already
[1:38:28] seated but let's just go to him in
[1:38:30] prayer
[1:38:31] father we come to you tonight Lord Jesus
[1:38:34] Lord bearing Lord all of these things
[1:38:36] upon our hearts Lord and they are Lord
[1:38:38] very burdensome to us Lord Jesus to see
[1:38:41] that your children Lord have been
[1:38:42] afflicted by the enemy father but Lord
[1:38:45] we know that you are high and that you
[1:38:47] are lifted up above every disease above
[1:38:50] every above every Cancer say oh Lord
[1:38:52] that could be in the body father and
[1:38:55] Lord we want to give you praise and
[1:38:57] adoration Lord for you are truly do of
[1:39:00] it father and Lord we had a prophet
[1:39:02] stand in this generation when he was
[1:39:04] speaking to an angel in the cave and he
[1:39:06] asked him he said he told him he said
[1:39:08] nothing would stand in front of his
[1:39:09] prayer and William Branham spoke these
[1:39:12] words he said not even cancer and the
[1:39:14] angel spoke back not even cancer now
[1:39:16] father We Believe Lord that where we're
[1:39:19] setting at that we are under the very
[1:39:20] spoken word the very opening of the word
[1:39:23] and we recognize that there is Authority
[1:39:25] in this body that is gathered here
[1:39:27] tonight but Lord there's a body of
[1:39:29] Believers all around the world that is
[1:39:31] calling upon the name of Jesus Christ
[1:39:33] for sister Erica father for brother Ron
[1:39:36] and the many others Lord that we could
[1:39:38] go on and mention father but these are
[1:39:40] the names that are presented to us
[1:39:41] tonight and Lord we would ask father
[1:39:43] that your Holy Spirit would arrest every
[1:39:46] Cancer cell father that Lord you would
[1:39:49] allow the Holy Spirit to work the works
[1:39:51] that you manifested there at Calvary to
[1:39:54] be manifested in their bodies father now
[1:39:56] Lord as we prepare ourselves to give
[1:39:58] over just for a few moments in Time Lord
[1:40:01] I pray that you would speak to us
[1:40:02] through thy Living Word In The Name of
[1:40:04] Jesus Christ and the church said amen
[1:40:07] amen I'd like to just speak to you just
[1:40:09] just from a thought on the elements the
[1:40:13] elements are ready
[1:40:15] the elements are ready and brother
[1:40:18] Brandon brother Brandon praise this in
[1:40:21] his prayer when he begins to break into
[1:40:23] the greatest the greatest series of
[1:40:25] messages that that he's going to bring
[1:40:27] forth throughout his ministry and he
[1:40:30] goes and there in 1963 in March of 1963
[1:40:33] he holds a meeting and he begins to he
[1:40:37] begins to do exactly what the angel told
[1:40:39] him to do is go back to Jeffersonville
[1:40:41] and preach the revelation of the Seven
[1:40:44] Seals but when brother Branham comes
[1:40:46] down to the seventh seal you remember
[1:40:48] that that brother Branham thought that
[1:40:50] he had said too much about it that he
[1:40:51] went back and re-recorded something
[1:40:53] something the very next day because he
[1:40:55] thought he had said too much but we have
[1:40:58] we have both copies as as we're
[1:41:00] listening to the seven seal you were
[1:41:02] hearing exactly like William Branham
[1:41:04] preached it to us but here brother
[1:41:06] Brandon when he when he's getting ready
[1:41:08] to break into the Rapture the Rapture
[1:41:11] seal and he goes in there and brother
[1:41:13] Brandon praise this prayer he said we
[1:41:15] can see the elements already are ready
[1:41:18] to bring the church into the presence of
[1:41:20] Christ he said we can see the bride
[1:41:22] taking on form and putting on the
[1:41:25] wedding garment making ready he said we
[1:41:27] can see the elements ready to bring the
[1:41:30] church into the presence of God and you
[1:41:33] know that William Branham was more than
[1:41:35] just a prophet but he was a prophet
[1:41:36] messenger but he wasn't just looking
[1:41:38] with him with a prophetic gift but he
[1:41:40] was looking through the eyes of the
[1:41:43] seventh angel as his operating there and
[1:41:45] he's watching all of the elements as all
[1:41:48] of the attributes that God has dispersed
[1:41:50] throughout the generation as they're
[1:41:52] coming into play that all of the
[1:41:54] elements already ready to think that
[1:41:57] tonight that that you are a part of
[1:41:59] those elements and to think that tonight
[1:42:00] that all the elements are ready to bring
[1:42:03] the church into the presence of Christ
[1:42:06] what the the brother or excuse me the
[1:42:08] Bible says here in Zechariah 4 and 10
[1:42:10] that that who hath despised the day of
[1:42:14] small things and we recognize that that
[1:42:17] God always does extra extraordinary
[1:42:20] things with what we would say is
[1:42:23] ordinary stuff you see just think about
[1:42:25] what he's made out of dirt look at you
[1:42:28] you think well how amazing that our
[1:42:30] bodies are that God made us out of the
[1:42:32] very elements of this Earth that all of
[1:42:35] us are made of 16 different elements to
[1:42:37] think that that God took what would say
[1:42:40] we would say ordinary dirt and he would
[1:42:42] make human beings out of it and the
[1:42:45] Bible tells us that he makes everything
[1:42:46] out of nothing and we recognize that
[1:42:49] with God that nothing is impossible you
[1:42:53] think that tonight that God would take
[1:42:55] what we would say is ordinary and he
[1:42:57] would make it extraordinary you see
[1:42:59] because in the hands of God when he
[1:43:01] blesses something or puts his blessing
[1:43:04] upon it you see you're not just dealing
[1:43:06] with Mortal man but you are dealing with
[1:43:08] the almighty all-powerful God that has
[1:43:11] all things in his control you think
[1:43:13] about a little boy a little boy that
[1:43:15] skipped lunch one time and he took well
[1:43:18] Jesus took that that little lunch and he
[1:43:21] fed five thousand with it you see in
[1:43:24] little as much if God is in it you see
[1:43:26] you see God knows how to take a sling
[1:43:28] and he knows how to kill a giant with it
[1:43:31] you know you recognize that here tonight
[1:43:33] I have in my possession I have a rock
[1:43:37] I think that's pretty neat
[1:43:39] I have a rock in my possession tonight
[1:43:41] that that it isn't just an ordinary Rock
[1:43:43] but this rock is a very special rock
[1:43:45] this rock came from David's Brook as we
[1:43:48] would say it came out of the rock that
[1:43:50] day out of the brook where David would
[1:43:52] walk down into the valley of Eli that he
[1:43:55] walked down in there he walked down in
[1:43:58] there and he grabbed at five smooth
[1:44:00] stones and he picked up an ordinary Rock
[1:44:03] but it was more than just an ordinary
[1:44:05] Rock but if we could let a rock testify
[1:44:08] for a moment tonight
[1:44:10] if we could let a rock testify just for
[1:44:13] a moment tonight I'd say that this rock
[1:44:15] could testify that I was there on that
[1:44:18] day when David walked down into that
[1:44:20] Valley and I watched David come down
[1:44:22] into that Valley like he was just
[1:44:24] another 14 year old boy but I watched
[1:44:28] him when he walked into that Valley he
[1:44:30] had the courage he had the courage
[1:44:32] greater than Goliath to think that
[1:44:35] tonight that that this rock if we can
[1:44:37] let it just speak to us just for a
[1:44:38] moment that he could testify I have been
[1:44:41] waiting for a moment like this all them
[1:44:44] days of my life ever since I was created
[1:44:47] I was waiting for the moment that
[1:44:49] somebody would pick me up and I could
[1:44:52] sling my little My Little Life and I
[1:44:55] could go and be known as a giant killer
[1:44:57] to think that a little video rock and
[1:45:00] these aren't just ordinary rocks but if
[1:45:02] you go to studying out the Bible that
[1:45:04] these are the rocks that God rained down
[1:45:06] over in the Book of Joshua that God ran
[1:45:09] down hailstones out of hell elephant and
[1:45:11] he destroyed the enemy right there these
[1:45:14] aren't just ordinary rocks these are
[1:45:16] rocks from another world and the rock of
[1:45:18] Revelation that's been presented to you
[1:45:20] tonight is a supernatural Rock it'll
[1:45:23] slay every time it'll kill every Cancer
[1:45:26] cell it'll kill every depression this
[1:45:29] rock is not an ordinary Rock it's the
[1:45:31] rock of testimony it's a rock to a fence
[1:45:34] of somebody but this is a rock that'll
[1:45:37] destroy every devil
[1:45:39] [Applause]
[1:45:44] this ain't just your ordinary message
[1:45:45] but this is a message for a rapture
[1:45:49] to think that God was forming all of the
[1:45:52] elements of these little ordinary rocks
[1:45:54] as we would say that God was creating
[1:45:57] and God was forming but you see most
[1:45:59] people never reach their full potential
[1:46:02] in life simply because they overlooked
[1:46:04] the potential of the ordinary you see if
[1:46:07] you simply start where you are instead
[1:46:09] of waiting to start until you get to
[1:46:11] where you hope to go you will never you
[1:46:14] will become all that you ever hope and
[1:46:16] everything that you ever dreamed if
[1:46:18] you'll start where you are instead of
[1:46:20] waiting for somebody else to put you
[1:46:22] into a position to get you to a spot
[1:46:24] there's a lot of people that want to be
[1:46:26] uh they want to be a supervisor but they
[1:46:29] never want to clean out the stars or
[1:46:31] they never want to work their way
[1:46:32] through the janitor position you got to
[1:46:34] start somewhere and you might be the
[1:46:36] lowest man on a totem pole you might be
[1:46:39] the weakest Christian in this building
[1:46:40] tonight but I want you to know you're
[1:46:43] not just an ordinary person because a
[1:46:45] prophet spoke to you and said the
[1:46:47] weakest of Christians shakes hell I say
[1:46:50] tonight if we be weak let's shake hell
[1:46:53] but if we be strong let's cause an
[1:46:56] earthquake down in hell
[1:47:03] so never Overlook the potential of the
[1:47:06] ordinary
[1:47:07] brother man brother random when he would
[1:47:09] begin to refer when he begin to refer
[1:47:12] when Jesus would walk past one person
[1:47:14] but he heals the Nets he said all of it
[1:47:17] was done by the will of the Lord and
[1:47:20] Jesus would stand there and he said now
[1:47:21] I'm not the Healer but I I am here he
[1:47:24] said I can do nothing except my father
[1:47:26] for shows me those things and not none
[1:47:29] of those things would be to question
[1:47:31] meaning you've got a reading over in the
[1:47:33] Book of John chapter 5 that when Jesus
[1:47:35] walks over there he walks into a
[1:47:38] hospital room and there's hundreds that
[1:47:40] are laying there waiting for their
[1:47:42] opportunity to step into the water but
[1:47:45] Jesus walks in there and gets a man
[1:47:47] that's had an infirmity in his life for
[1:47:49] 38 years he wasn't going to die of that
[1:47:52] infirmity but he had something that was
[1:47:55] calling to the father to come by his way
[1:48:00] but notice brother Madam said there's
[1:48:02] three elements that people dwell in the
[1:48:04] first one is humanistic he said we down
[1:48:06] here he said well I'll pray for that one
[1:48:09] and he said I'm hoping that now they'll
[1:48:12] get well he said but the second element
[1:48:13] is divine revelation he said that's when
[1:48:16] something down in your heart anchors it
[1:48:19] and it says it's going to happen he said
[1:48:21] something is going to happen he said but
[1:48:23] third the third element is the vision he
[1:48:26] said or the word of the Lord made
[1:48:28] manifest and he said when you see it
[1:48:30] it's thus say of the Lord and to think
[1:48:32] that where you're living at no man has
[1:48:35] ever lived here no man has ever
[1:48:37] possessed the realm that you're living
[1:48:38] in because you are living at the vision
[1:48:41] of the Holy Ghost and to think that
[1:48:44] you're living as the Church of the
[1:48:46] Living God you're living out the save
[1:48:48] the Lord you're speaking out the saith
[1:48:50] the Lord
[1:48:52] you see what this message does this
[1:48:55] message is calling you to come up a
[1:48:57] little bit higher this message is
[1:48:59] pulling you into another realm it is the
[1:49:02] element this message is the element that
[1:49:04] will take this body into a Rapture
[1:49:06] change
[1:49:10] we we recognize and I forgive me I
[1:49:14] I'm too nervous I'm too nervous up here
[1:49:17] tonight because what could happen but we
[1:49:20] recognize that when Jesus is having and
[1:49:22] when Jesus is and in our scripture
[1:49:24] reading that Jesus when he's there and
[1:49:26] he's coming into it and we recognize
[1:49:28] when you go to reading over in Matthew
[1:49:30] chapter 3 that John is up there and he's
[1:49:33] preaching repentance unto them and he's
[1:49:35] preaching the repentance or remissions
[1:49:37] of sins and he's up there telling them
[1:49:39] he said now he said I'm baptizing you
[1:49:41] with water he said but ah there's one
[1:49:44] that is coming after me that is greater
[1:49:46] than myself he said you see now I'm
[1:49:49] baptizing you with water but the one
[1:49:51] that is coming after me is mightier than
[1:49:53] me and he's going to baptize you with a
[1:49:56] fire and the Holy Ghost and when John
[1:49:59] began to speak those words there the
[1:50:01] Lamb of God was seen standing on the
[1:50:04] banks of the Jordan River and John
[1:50:06] turned around and prophesied that there
[1:50:08] was the Lamb of God
[1:50:11] and to think that this was exactly what
[1:50:14] was laying in the scriptures that was
[1:50:16] foretold in Malachi chapter 3 that
[1:50:18] behold I send my messenger before my
[1:50:21] face now look at the elements that are
[1:50:23] coming into play John was there Jesus
[1:50:26] was there and Jesus is saying it is
[1:50:29] becoming to us that we fulfill all
[1:50:31] righteousness now to think now Jesus
[1:50:34] Jesus is is the perfect one but Jesus
[1:50:37] recognized recognizes that he has got to
[1:50:40] be washed before before he goes to
[1:50:43] Calvary just like every sacrifice has
[1:50:46] got to be washed before it can go before
[1:50:48] the father and that's the problem with
[1:50:50] too many people's worship is they've
[1:50:53] never watched themselves by the watering
[1:50:55] of the word so they can never bring a
[1:50:57] clean worship to God so they'll bring a
[1:50:59] half-hearted worship or they'll bring a
[1:51:02] half-hearted desire or a half-hearted
[1:51:04] prayer life and they'll never see the
[1:51:06] fruition of a manifestation of what God
[1:51:09] Said would be and they'll turn around
[1:51:11] and blame God
[1:51:13] but I'll say this by the word of the
[1:51:15] Lord that the elements are ready to take
[1:51:18] this bride higher than you've ever been
[1:51:21] before I'm just talking about your faith
[1:51:23] but I'm talking about another dimension
[1:51:25] there is a word in this generation
[1:51:28] that'll take you to another world
[1:51:31] now William Branham said that if we we
[1:51:33] have enough faith and we have the
[1:51:35] ability to go out there and speak a new
[1:51:37] world and walk out into it to think that
[1:51:39] you have the ability but God's got a law
[1:51:42] that won't allow you to do that because
[1:51:43] God's got to have an overcomer that
[1:51:46] lives out this generation
[1:51:49] but to think that tonight you have the
[1:51:52] elements in your mind in your life in
[1:51:55] your body to speak a new world
[1:51:59] Hallelujah let me keep building here
[1:52:01] just for a moment we recognize that
[1:52:04] before a seed can fall into the ground
[1:52:07] that the ground has got to be ready to
[1:52:10] receive what God has breast
[1:52:12] predestinated it to be just like when
[1:52:15] God was there in the very beginning he
[1:52:18] spoke the word he thought the word he
[1:52:21] spoke the word and we saw the
[1:52:23] manifestation of the word we recognize
[1:52:25] that by the word of the Lord were the
[1:52:28] heavens made and all the hosts of them
[1:52:31] by the breath of his mouth so God
[1:52:34] believed his own world
[1:52:36] and he rode worlds off of his fingertips
[1:52:39] and what was he doing he was giving us
[1:52:42] insight into the mind of God
[1:52:46] and we recognize we recognize that there
[1:52:49] Adam was in spirit realm he was there in
[1:52:52] spirit realm but God didn't have a man
[1:52:55] on the earth that could kill the ground
[1:52:57] so God caused a deep sleep to call to to
[1:53:01] fall excuse me he created man Out of the
[1:53:03] Dust of the earth and their man began to
[1:53:07] till the ground
[1:53:08] is that all right now to think that
[1:53:11] God's been working on his creation for
[1:53:13] six thousand years for six days he's
[1:53:16] been working on his creation he's been
[1:53:18] watching as he said let there be and
[1:53:20] molecules came into existence
[1:53:23] he spoke it and he could have rolled out
[1:53:26] there a million years
[1:53:28] and then it got to its little spot and
[1:53:31] then God stopped it where it needed to
[1:53:33] be
[1:53:34] and for six thousand years as God is
[1:53:36] creating as God is creating an earth
[1:53:38] they are Adam's Body is laying in the
[1:53:41] dust of the Earth but when God got to a
[1:53:44] spot that he needed a flesh man to till
[1:53:47] the ground there which God had spoke
[1:53:50] over 6 000 years ago Adam's Body had
[1:53:54] been laying in the ground to think that
[1:53:56] he grabbed the potass and he grabbed the
[1:53:58] calcium and he grabbed this element and
[1:54:01] he brought it together and he formed his
[1:54:03] creative Son by the name of Adam and to
[1:54:06] think that God took what he spoke and
[1:54:09] made it come into existence and to think
[1:54:12] that the world has rejected you and
[1:54:14] hated you all of your life but you are
[1:54:17] exactly what God has been looking for
[1:54:20] brother Branham said that he bred this
[1:54:23] one to that one and read this one to
[1:54:25] that one until he got exactly what he
[1:54:27] wanted it's like a man building times he
[1:54:30] adds in so much brass so much steel and
[1:54:33] so much horror until he gets the right
[1:54:35] ring or the right tone as it's coming
[1:54:37] forth and there is a music on the inside
[1:54:41] of the Bride of Jesus Christ that has
[1:54:43] got to ring out
[1:54:46] it's guttering out
[1:54:50] I ain't got enough time to preach all
[1:54:52] that's on my heart tonight but do you
[1:54:54] recognize that William William Branham
[1:54:55] is standing there in the message Shalom
[1:54:57] he said what was it he said it was the
[1:55:00] drug it was the beating of the drums
[1:55:02] that was taking place he said when I
[1:55:04] went back there on the back side of that
[1:55:06] desert and he said those angels met me
[1:55:08] and told me to go back and preach those
[1:55:11] Seven Seals he said what was it he said
[1:55:13] it rang out in the sky Shalom now what
[1:55:17] was that it was peace to the Church of
[1:55:19] the Living God and to think he said it
[1:55:22] was the beating of the drums he said it
[1:55:24] was a sympathy it was a changing of the
[1:55:26] part
[1:55:28] let me tell you methodists they
[1:55:30] fulfilled their position Luther fell
[1:55:32] fulfilled his position but it is
[1:55:34] behooving unto us that we fulfill our
[1:55:38] position let me tell you William Branham
[1:55:41] ran his race and he ran it well but it's
[1:55:44] our turn to run
[1:55:47] coming to us that we take this mystery
[1:55:50] we take these revealed Mysteries
[1:55:52] [Applause]
[1:55:56] vertical
[1:56:00] you imagine
[1:56:01] how the father felt
[1:56:10] that he takes these elements
[1:56:13] and he breathes out Adam
[1:56:16] and he breathes into him the very Breath
[1:56:18] of Life
[1:56:20] can you imagine how God felt to watch it
[1:56:24] that this one is made in my own image to
[1:56:28] carry out the duties on this Earth that
[1:56:31] I am asking him to do can you imagine
[1:56:33] how he felt as a father brother Brandon
[1:56:36] said in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:56:37] revealed he said he loved fatherhood so
[1:56:39] much that he became a father
[1:56:41] can you imagine how much God feels
[1:56:44] tonight you can go all the way back to
[1:56:46] the Garden of Eden and think tonight
[1:56:48] brother Jason that God has the same
[1:56:50] feeling over you as he does over that
[1:56:54] back there all the way some 6 000 years
[1:56:56] ago that he had back there that there I
[1:56:59] created the very first one but here is
[1:57:02] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:57:04] again coming into fruition and to think
[1:57:07] you're not like Adam and you're not like
[1:57:10] Eve because the first Adam and the first
[1:57:12] Eve fail but you will never fail because
[1:57:15] a prophet said that you've been
[1:57:17] predestinated not to fall you are
[1:57:20] standing on thus saith the Lord out of
[1:57:22] the elements of spoken word as the
[1:57:26] has this come into position
[1:57:34] when Noah when Noah come to his spot and
[1:57:38] he began to preach that it's going to
[1:57:40] rain that Noah got up there that God had
[1:57:43] already provided a way for Noah and he
[1:57:45] got up there he's sitting there he said
[1:57:48] now he said there wasn't no rain Affair
[1:57:50] he said but Noah began to preach that
[1:57:53] it's going to rain and by the preaching
[1:57:55] of the word the elements of rain come
[1:57:58] into the heavens now God is going to
[1:58:00] have somebody believe him God's going to
[1:58:03] have somebody take him out his word
[1:58:04] whether somebody tells you you can do it
[1:58:07] or whether somebody criticizes you and
[1:58:09] tell you that it's never going to rain
[1:58:11] you're never going to get out of
[1:58:12] laodicea but Noah believe what God said
[1:58:15] no matter the critics of 120 years
[1:58:18] saying it ain't gonna rain but he kept
[1:58:21] preaching it's going to rain I'll tell
[1:58:24] you Noah preached so much he preached
[1:58:26] it's going to rain so much that it
[1:58:28] rained 40 days and 40 nights I'll tell
[1:58:31] you if we turn ourselves loose to
[1:58:33] preaching healing and the bridge
[1:58:34] Miracles and the preach thus say of the
[1:58:37] Lord you'll see a manifestation of the
[1:58:39] reign of the Holy Ghost in This Place
[1:58:41] I'll tell you what it is it's the latter
[1:58:44] rain it's the Holy Ghost Reign it's a
[1:58:47] manifestation of the hour that we're
[1:58:49] living in
[1:58:49] [Applause]
[1:59:01] now you believe in healing
[1:59:04] because you've heard somebody tell you
[1:59:06] of healing
[1:59:08] so how can you hear without a preacher
[1:59:12] and how can they preach unless they be
[1:59:14] sent now to think that tonight because
[1:59:16] you believe in healing somebody was sent
[1:59:19] so that you could hear about healing
[1:59:21] there's a need in your body so he sends
[1:59:24] a preacher by your way to preach it's
[1:59:26] Isaiah 53 for you and he preaches it in
[1:59:29] such a way that you believe that no
[1:59:32] matter what else anybody else says it's
[1:59:34] going to happen or not you believe it's
[1:59:35] going to happen now you've got needs in
[1:59:37] your body so God sends Somebody by there
[1:59:40] because you have a need so he preaches
[1:59:43] he sends an evangelist that believes in
[1:59:45] Divine Healing or he preaches or he
[1:59:48] preaches on deliverance from chains of
[1:59:50] sigmix sigmas and and sickness and
[1:59:53] complexes and those things because you
[1:59:55] have a need in your life God has it's a
[1:59:58] deep call to the Deep church and to
[2:00:01] think that tonight the reason why you
[2:00:03] believe in miracles is because you've
[2:00:05] heard of Miracles if you've never heard
[2:00:07] of them you'd have never believed in
[2:00:09] them and that's why too many people sit
[2:00:11] back there and there are afraid to
[2:00:13] believe in the impossible because they
[2:00:15] never heard of it but Hallelujah I'll be
[2:00:18] one of those preachers that'll stand
[2:00:19] here and say we still have Miracles with
[2:00:23] an angry shouts in Miracles we are
[2:00:26] seeing Miracles
[2:00:27] the reason why people don't have the
[2:00:29] Holy Ghost in their church anymore is
[2:00:32] because they don't preach the Holy Ghost
[2:00:33] the reason why they don't have
[2:00:35] demonstration They Don't Preach
[2:00:36] demonstration the reason why they don't
[2:00:38] have speaking in tongues because they
[2:00:40] don't speak it and preach it but this is
[2:00:43] a message of restoration and there is a
[2:00:46] body on Earth that believes the saith
[2:00:48] the Lord I'll say this the elements are
[2:00:51] ready to take this body into another
[2:00:53] world
[2:00:54] [Applause]
[2:01:01] when brother Adam comes and he preaches
[2:01:03] perfect faith
[2:01:04] he said faith
[2:01:07] it's a substance of things hoped for
[2:01:09] it's the evidence of Things Not Seen he
[2:01:12] said faith is a real thing
[2:01:14] if you ain't listening to a while go and
[2:01:16] listen to it he'll do you hit it to you
[2:01:18] great it'll build your face up but he
[2:01:20] said he said you find a man that's
[2:01:22] living in that kind of Faith he said he
[2:01:25] is he is so isolated to the rest of the
[2:01:27] world he said you find a man like that
[2:01:29] he said they're getting in Broad
[2:01:31] material and they're getting in Rapture
[2:01:33] and condition and to think that you are
[2:01:37] exactly what William Branham said would
[2:01:38] come to pass in the seventh seal that
[2:01:41] the elements are ready to bring the
[2:01:43] church into the presence of the Living
[2:01:46] God now I have to tell you I enjoy
[2:01:49] shouting I enjoy speaking in tongues I
[2:01:52] enjoy dancing here I enjoy worshiping
[2:01:55] the Lord here I enjoy watching prodigals
[2:01:58] come back home but there is nothing that
[2:02:00] can take it away from my heart to see
[2:02:02] the rapture
[2:02:05] I'ma tell you what if there's going to
[2:02:08] be one thing that we're going to preach
[2:02:09] in 2023 it's our Rapture it's not for a
[2:02:13] day gone by you are Hallelujah
[2:02:16] you are the people of the Rapture
[2:02:18] there's not another generation coming it
[2:02:21] is the save the Lord
[2:02:22] [Applause]
[2:02:32] you imagine what it's going to be like
[2:02:35] urine Rapture and condition brother
[2:02:37] Timmy
[2:02:39] you're in bright material little bride
[2:02:43] but can you imagine
[2:02:49] when reality sets in
[2:02:52] that it's more than a dream
[2:02:54] and it's more than just happening in the
[2:02:56] middle of the night
[2:03:00] a while back brother Jeffrey watched his
[2:03:02] daddy come into the room
[2:03:04] stand right there in the corner and
[2:03:06] watched him
[2:03:08] it's going to be one of these days he
[2:03:09] ain't gonna leave us
[2:03:11] but he's going to pull us up what was it
[2:03:14] it is this message that is pulling us
[2:03:16] into the realm of a higher calling let
[2:03:19] me tell you I'm not against any church
[2:03:21] and not I'm not against any any of these
[2:03:24] denominations I'm against the system but
[2:03:26] I am against the people but I'll tell
[2:03:28] you that what they've got can never take
[2:03:30] this ego off the ground but what William
[2:03:33] Branham brought to this generation will
[2:03:35] take this body
[2:03:37] and change her every molecule to think
[2:03:40] that all of her hair that's been lost
[2:03:42] throughout the ages is going to come
[2:03:44] back on her head all of those people
[2:03:46] that have false teeth all of a sudden
[2:03:48] things will start happening
[2:03:51] why not the elements are ready
[2:03:53] [Applause]
[2:03:55] [Music]
[2:03:58] and Satan's going to do everything he do
[2:04:01] to try to stop you from getting to this
[2:04:02] rapture but he don't have enough to stop
[2:04:05] you
[2:04:07] he can throw every tactic he can throw
[2:04:09] every weapon he can throw every idea
[2:04:12] every carnal impersonation every carnal
[2:04:15] intellectual idea at the pride of Jesus
[2:04:17] Christ and she will not be stopped from
[2:04:20] making it into the Rapture let me tell
[2:04:22] you she's going to be there I was sold
[2:04:24] by a prophet I was sold by Jesus Christ
[2:04:27] I'm going to be there
[2:04:34] laughs
[2:04:36] I'm gonna be there
[2:04:38] because a Rapture is already in me
[2:04:42] the elements are ready
[2:04:46] it's a powerful thing
[2:04:50] when I think about
[2:04:54] you think about what has went on
[2:04:56] and we could
[2:04:58] there's no way I started a book this
[2:05:00] past year
[2:05:01] on the supernatural events of what's
[2:05:03] happened
[2:05:06] and I ain't been able to keep up
[2:05:09] I literally cannot keep up
[2:05:11] with all the supernatural things
[2:05:13] I ordered this I ordered this notebook
[2:05:15] and I began to write those things down
[2:05:16] and the person that made the book for me
[2:05:18] said I can't wait to hear that
[2:05:20] that sounds like an interesting thing
[2:05:22] they'll probably never see it
[2:05:25] I'll never be able to write down all the
[2:05:27] things that I've seen sister Stephanie
[2:05:31] let me tell you brother Brandon said
[2:05:33] when he was out there he said it was
[2:05:34] happening so fast
[2:05:36] that he couldn't keep up with
[2:05:38] I think that that when Jesus was hanging
[2:05:40] on the cross prophecy after prophecy
[2:05:43] after prophecy was being fulfilled
[2:05:45] it's going to be like that that one of
[2:05:48] these mornings between the hours of six
[2:05:49] and nine things are going to be
[2:05:50] happening so fast to you
[2:05:53] that you won't be able to keep up with
[2:05:56] I think about what's happened this past
[2:05:57] year and there there's Miracles all in
[2:05:59] this room and if you ain't if you ain't
[2:06:01] heard of a miracle or you ain't seen a
[2:06:03] miracle talk to somebody in this room
[2:06:06] foreign
[2:06:08] that was here last weekend talk to
[2:06:10] somebody this week and hear about the
[2:06:12] Miracles that they have had happened in
[2:06:14] their life what is it it's the
[2:06:16] supernatural
[2:06:17] [Music]
[2:06:21] probably I
[2:06:24] um
[2:06:24] I'm past my time already but I'm going
[2:06:26] to tell you one more thing
[2:06:28] we're not just ordinary people
[2:06:34] but one of the greatest events that ever
[2:06:36] happened to me in my life and I
[2:06:38] there's no way I can write it down
[2:06:39] because the Vivid the vivid memory of it
[2:06:41] is too great
[2:06:43] but to think about
[2:06:46] to think about what the Lord has done
[2:06:48] for my little family
[2:06:51] my little family
[2:06:55] I could go on and on on this front this
[2:06:58] front row of the Miracles
[2:07:00] but to think of that
[2:07:02] God had something pre-planned in his
[2:07:05] mind
[2:07:06] you've heard me tell it before maybe
[2:07:08] just once
[2:07:10] but I was there at a camp
[2:07:13] and the Lord spoke to my wife and told
[2:07:15] her you're going to experience
[2:07:17] the Lord in a higher way or a greater
[2:07:20] way is that is that how it spoke
[2:07:23] something along those lines you're going
[2:07:25] to experience the Lord in a higher level
[2:07:29] now the reason why I'm married Katie is
[2:07:31] because she had the Holy Ghost
[2:07:33] I watched her get it
[2:07:36] you ever seen somebody born
[2:07:39] you ever seen somebody come to life
[2:07:42] you never forget it
[2:07:45] I'd say brother Reuben can testify to
[2:07:47] these things to watch somebody the
[2:07:48] elements of the body come together in
[2:07:50] all of these events
[2:07:52] but I don't watch sister Katie I watched
[2:07:53] around all her
[2:07:57] I watched her all my life and
[2:08:00] I think about when I was first married I
[2:08:02] didn't have the Holy Ghost I don't
[2:08:04] advise that
[2:08:05] but I got
[2:08:07] I was a man that needed the Holy Ghost
[2:08:08] but I got so mad at times
[2:08:12] because she prayed so long
[2:08:15] oh man I got to go to sleep sometime I
[2:08:17] could get up and work in the morning you
[2:08:19] think man what a devil I was
[2:08:22] but I had I had a need of what she had
[2:08:24] in her life
[2:08:27] I watched I watched her I watched how
[2:08:29] the Lord it would work through her and
[2:08:31] and just help that she would pray and
[2:08:32] how she could bring the presence of the
[2:08:34] Lord down I finally got what she had
[2:08:38] I got it too late in my mind or a lot of
[2:08:41] people's minds
[2:08:44] foreign
[2:08:50] there I watched
[2:08:52] the fruition of what God had spoke
[2:08:55] going to pass at our Labor Day
[2:08:58] this past year
[2:09:00] when brother Tim Pruitt preached on
[2:09:02] investigating angels
[2:09:04] that an angel has come and investigated
[2:09:06] our faith
[2:09:10] and the angel Lord got in the car with
[2:09:12] us at something about when you get him
[2:09:14] in a car
[2:09:16] something's going to happen he'll drive
[2:09:17] for you too
[2:09:19] and presence of the Lord got so so
[2:09:22] strong in the car and I said Lord if you
[2:09:24] can just get me home
[2:09:26] if you can just get me home
[2:09:29] I sure would appreciate it I got to the
[2:09:32] house where we got to the end of the
[2:09:33] driveway we got to the end of the
[2:09:34] driveway I jumped out of the car began
[2:09:37] speaking in tongues and all of a sudden
[2:09:39] the presence of the Lord Katie was just
[2:09:41] sitting there praying in the car praying
[2:09:43] and I hope I'm not taking up your time
[2:09:44] but I'm telling you I'm telling you that
[2:09:46] this is happening it's happening every
[2:09:49] it's happening every weekend it's
[2:09:50] happening every moment there's somebody
[2:09:52] that is calling out for a deeper
[2:09:54] sincerity
[2:09:55] a deeper calling
[2:09:58] and I'll take whatever he has need for
[2:10:00] me to have in this life
[2:10:03] if the elements are ready I want to be
[2:10:05] exactly where he wants me to be
[2:10:07] I got up as a spirit of the Lord
[2:10:10] instructed me and I spoke to Sister
[2:10:12] Katie this is it
[2:10:16] she busted out that car
[2:10:20] she busted out that car speaking in
[2:10:23] tongues dancing rolling around
[2:10:26] on the ground
[2:10:28] underneath an oak tree
[2:10:32] and brother Tim Pruitt had preached on
[2:10:35] Melchizedek coming and setting
[2:10:37] underneath the oak tree that night
[2:10:40] now I I've said that not just to draw
[2:10:42] attention to my family or to Sister
[2:10:44] Katie but I want to tell you what you
[2:10:46] are experiencing this is it
[2:10:49] now I don't believe you got to speak in
[2:10:51] tongues to have the Holy Ghost but I
[2:10:53] believe that you can and I believe that
[2:10:55] you will at some point in your life be
[2:10:57] able to speak in another tongue now I
[2:11:00] don't I don't believe that that is the
[2:11:01] evidence of the Holy Ghost and I don't
[2:11:03] want you getting that picture whatsoever
[2:11:04] from my preaching but I want you to
[2:11:06] gather from this that there has been a
[2:11:08] restoration of the gifts back into the
[2:11:11] Church of the Living God and I what I
[2:11:13] what I what I'm here I believe that God
[2:11:16] has set us at a place in time that we
[2:11:18] ought to be able to preach that all of
[2:11:20] the elements are back to the Church of
[2:11:23] the Living God I believe that Visions
[2:11:25] are back in the church I believe that
[2:11:27] tongues are back in the church I believe
[2:11:29] what William Branham said was the
[2:11:31] evidence of the Holy Ghost is to be able
[2:11:33] to say Amen to every word of God that is
[2:11:37] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is to be
[2:11:40] able to say Amen to this message Amen to
[2:11:44] all of the things that the Lord has in
[2:11:46] store for us I'd say that we stop
[2:11:48] putting the elements of up on the Shelf
[2:11:50] somewhere and we pull the elements down
[2:11:53] and let it pull us back into the
[2:11:56] presence of the most high God
[2:12:02] you won't stop the move of God
[2:12:04] Satan can do everything he wants to us
[2:12:06] but he won't stop it
[2:12:10] you know where it was
[2:12:11] you know there was a there was a big
[2:12:13] Corporation one time that said that they
[2:12:16] were going to they were buying up all
[2:12:18] these properties because they were
[2:12:19] putting their big they were putting
[2:12:20] their big uh their big Corporation their
[2:12:23] big Market at this certain place and
[2:12:25] they were buying up all the properties
[2:12:27] in this place but there was one guy that
[2:12:30] wouldn't sell out and he had this little
[2:12:31] bitty old building right right in the
[2:12:33] middle of where they were going to be
[2:12:34] building at and they were bound and
[2:12:36] determined that they were going to get
[2:12:37] that guy to completely get out of there
[2:12:40] because they wanted that spot and he
[2:12:42] said I'm not selling out he said I built
[2:12:44] this from my hands up he said I built it
[2:12:46] all the way up he said it's mine my
[2:12:48] daddy worked for this he said I've
[2:12:49] worked for this he said I'm not selling
[2:12:51] out because because you want it he said
[2:12:54] well we're going to force you to get out
[2:12:55] of it and they built this big
[2:12:56] corporation on every side of this side
[2:12:59] they built it so much higher they said
[2:13:01] they built it so high and they build it
[2:13:03] 500 yards that way they put this side of
[2:13:06] the building for on the other side of
[2:13:07] his property and they built it 500 yards
[2:13:10] that way he said we're going to put you
[2:13:12] out of business and they put up there
[2:13:14] they put up there they put up their
[2:13:17] grand opening and they're doing their
[2:13:19] best to shut this guy out of business
[2:13:20] they're trying to trying to make him
[2:13:22] sell out and that's what Satan has tried
[2:13:24] to do to a lot of people he's trying to
[2:13:26] get them to sell out but you see this
[2:13:29] man had a different idea he wasn't going
[2:13:32] to sell out they had built all kinds of
[2:13:34] things around him but on the opening day
[2:13:36] he put a sign on his door main entrance
[2:13:41] so the enemy can build all kinds of
[2:13:43] things around you but this is the main
[2:13:46] entrance this message is the main
[2:13:49] entrance into the portals of Glory
