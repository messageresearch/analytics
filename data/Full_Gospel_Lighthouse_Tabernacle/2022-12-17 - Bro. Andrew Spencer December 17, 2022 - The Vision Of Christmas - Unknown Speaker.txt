notes here and I get up and I still don't read what I put down so I got a pen I'm going to Market as we go tonight so this is something we can't send out in a text because some people don't get texts and then some people like me maybe not read the text you know you know that's why I got a good wife you know to help me out here you know as we get closer to the end of the year here we want to close it out on a good news just like a just like you do you go to school your teacher said hey we'll close a year out on a good note that's what we're going to do close it out on a good note and as you're going into the new year here we want to do the right things so as you come in please please be respectful try not to walk around or talk I mean if you need to talk we can go out outside we've got places you know you could do just speak out there but try not to come in and carry in a full conversation here in the church because you know this is something that's not new that we're talking here you know this has been going on 50 years I don't know close to it probably I haven't heard it probably since when 72 I mean this is nothing you know we're not trying to we're not trying to we're not coming up with something new we're just trying to be respectful as we as we come in here you know I wrote these things down now and brother Ronald touched on this last week you know we got a convention atmosphere that's going on here so every week so we want to come in you know when the spirit is moving we want to try to be as relevant as possible we don't want to be moving trying to if your kids got to go try to get them to stay because we don't want to do nothing that way I mean it's the same way with me right here I I don't do nothing wrong with saying anything wrong here to break the spirit right here it's no different for me up here and I take this as a seriousness as them guys right there preaching back here I mean but we want to be as Reverend I mean but we don't want to you know if you see people if it's poor service or stuff the deacons are just going to come up and just tap you on the shoulder just what we've done for years that you know try to be as reverent as possible you know I mean this is not a place to come you know eat and drink I mean I know that people's got health issues that they might need something for sugar or something but we ain't we don't have to make a scene and lay a pack of nabs or or a candy bar out to everybody can see it I mean you could be discreet about it and and not and not make a big scene about it um I mean well even even with our drinks coming in and out you know we're not expecting people's cups I know covet we shut down the water fountains I mean and we that's the right thing to do but we don't have to come in it ain't like we ran Our Last Mile home we got sat there and and and drank 16 ounces you know but we haven't ran we haven't ran Our Last Mile home yet but we head that way but I mean it's just it's just some things that you know we don't want to I'm gonna just you know we don't we don't want to this is not a place I think it's First Corinthians uh First Corinthians 11 around I think the 22nd verse we're not coming here to eat and drink you know we're coming here to to respect I mean if you go to the White House you go anywhere else they ain't gonna let you carry a bottle of water in or jug of them juice or whatever you got I mean just just try to be respectful as we can and when we when we do these things we want to watch our kids the full service after service steering service just try to be respectful as we can I mean if I mean I wasn't perfect my brother went perfect we got I've been on the receiving end and I've been on the giving in when you take your kids out you know I mean look at my mom she's 74 years old didn't bother her she ain't got a gray hair you know I mean just there's some things that we just need to we just need to do you know just if your kids if your kids I mean try I mean if I if sister Cassie got up right here now from that piano I could see her move and I when I was in school I got easily distracted just for being respectful to people around you when you move you're going to distract somebody so just just try to just try to do the right things I mean sometimes the kids they you know everybody don't have great days all the time and so if they're having a bad day don't come and go come and go just try to be respectful to the people around you um this is not a place where we where it was called slumber parties we don't have parties here you know try if you teach your kids be respectful here when they get here they will respect the house of the Lord that's what we that's what we're here for you know we want to teach them the right things here this is where they're going to this is where they make their future right here so we want to do the right things here okay brother Bill did this for years and years he did it probably more regular than I did he he he did it probably on a monthly basis especially he used to get up and sort of direct the young people's meeting we had them years ago and on a monthly basis he used to go over these things so it's not like we're doing something you know just you know if you don't a guy told me and my brother one time he said have some respect for yourself if you don't have it for nobody else I mean I mean and then it just we just want to do the right thing but just be as reverent as we can and and just try to do the right thing so you know we had a coach one time and he harped on this this last thing and I know it's four people still love me here Zoe and I my mom and my wife so so coach left us was if he preached just on the weekends because he was dealing with young teenage kids that was going out on the weekend and all young teenage kids is not perfect and he said this quote right here and just remember this he said do the right thing for it's the right thing to do I love you amen we think brother Alan for that amen so I'll just add a little bit to it if you have to take your children out one to two times and they're still screaming like crazy might ought to go to the nursery and stay there for a little bit I remember when if my mom and dad more my mom if she had to take me out one time there was an old Bush behind the church and I thank God when they cut it down because the branches on the thing went from the ground wept all the way around and touched the ground once again and them things would wrap around three times before they quit you know I hey we're not talking

not unknown to us but he is known he is known what a privilege it is to be called as children certainly I want to say that it's such an honor to have sister Deborah back on the organ again playing for us and we certainly missed her and and we certainly appreciate the gift that the Lord has placed in our life and and I'm so thankful that the Lord's certainly touched her we've we've prayed many prayers for her and I know I know that that sciatica is uh is a real real deal and so we just want to continue to remember her but we certainly want to make her feel welcomed back here and uh [Music] I want to thank Brother David and his family for being here this weekend and thank you for singing my song to think that Jesus chose to be my friend [Music] it's everything when Jesus chooses to be your friend [Music] amen I just I love him so much and there's no way that I could express it with words and nor with nor with my emotions or my the intellects that I have they're inadequate to express how much my Lord Jesus means to me and I want to just take this moment and thank you thank you all here for Gospel Lighthouse for all your your Christmas giving and your your gifts to my children and to my family and I want you to know whether it's popcorn whether it's a gift card or if it's just a card that says God Bless you that's thank you I I don't deserve any of that but I want to say that I really appreciate it and you know I'm kind of like the prophet I enjoy getting those Christmas gifts and and it's something about that that first gift that you get you remember it and I won't tell you who give it to me but I certainly do appreciate it I appreciate every one of them and I love this time of year and and I just look forward to this time of year I wish it could be Christmas you know every day of the year for us as Christians it is we we honor and celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ but you know what I mean it's it's a special time of year when people are happy it's you know it seems like the Christmas spirit's sure getting squeezed out of America anymore but it certainly is nice to see people happy and wishing people Merry Christmas and and they're giving and that's that's Christ right there when you see somebody giving a gift that's Christ and uh so we we just want to maybe just speak to you for a few moments on on the on our Christmas message this evening and and I won't be too long Lord willing and uh but I do want I do have something on my heart and I trust that the Lord will help me to to bring it across to you tonight but if you have your Bibles we'd like to look over in the book of Isaiah the book of Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6. and then to Matthew chapter one and verse 18. next weekend we will only be having one service on Saturday night we'll be having our our Christmas special and all of our choirs will be singing and brother Ron will be speaking for us there'll be no service on Sunday morning there so we ask you just to be remembering that and we want to give you a time to be with your family and we know where where the people's minds are that's why we want to bring you our Christmas message at this time is because this is a season that where everybody's minds are and and uh you know I feel like if if the prophet would come and he would take his Christmas message during this season I think it's the right thing to do is is to take our Christmas message in this season where we recognize that this was not the hour or the 25th day of Christmas or the 25th day of December was not the day that our Lord and savior was born on but it's a time that we honor it and so we're just looking to the Lord during this season and so let's if you have your Bibles let's look let's look in the book of Isaiah here in chapter 9 and the Bible says For unto us a a child is born and unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this Matthew chapter 1 and verse 18. I'm going to let you find your find your scripture reading there in Matthew chapter 1 and verse 18 and before we read it we'll just speak to the Lord let's just bow our hearts just now Heavenly Father what a privilege it is for us as your children to be gathered one more time in this this place Lord that has been set aside a place that Lord that has been sacred for us for so many times in so many years father for us to be able to come here into the house of the Lord and to worship you the true and living God and to recognize that you are king of kings and tonight is no different father we recognize that the same one that has met us time and time again season after season you are here again tonight in your word and in your power father to speak to us according to your word Lord that is that is fit for us in this season and Lord I pray father today that Lord if I could Lord I'd give every person here uh everything that they had need of and and a gift of some way but father I know that I'm inadequate in that but I know father that that there is one in this building tonight that can meet every single one of their needs you can supply all of their wants father those that need healing and those that need a touch father those that maybe just need a further walk with you father a fresh Revival I believe Lord that you're here to do that you said that you said through your Prophet Lord that that every Revival every generation he has a fresh chance at the word of God and I pray father that you would just come behind your word tonight with a Vindicated amen father and you'd minister to us through your through the preaching of the word father I ask God to you just have your will in your way in this service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Matthew Chapter 1 Verse 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost and you you adults understand what is there before they came together she was found with child but it matters who she was found of of the the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth the son and thou shall call his name Jesus let's say that together Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God With Us may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord I'd like to read just a portion from we have seen his star and have come to worship Him brother Branham says here he said this that I'm speaking of tonight might seem just a little bit unusual and especially of these notes and scriptures that I have written here which I will refer to as many of them takes takes down the scriptures and so forth he said it's a little unusual but I want you to always bear this in mind that God is unusual God does unusual things that's the trouble with us today that we get set so set in the usual things we get so set in the usual things that when something unusual takes place then we're all out of it and we don't know what's happened God does the unusual and I believe that if we could look at these two texts that we've read here tonight that we could say that that it's unusual to the eyes of humanity that it's unusual and it's past the reasoning of the intellect of man to to say that these things that we've been just reading about about that there would be a woman that had not known a man that she would be with a child of the Holy Ghost is very unusual is that right I'd like to speak to you tonight or on by the help of the Lord or just on a on a thought of the vision or the vision of Christmas the vision of Christmas and I think that I think that if as we just draw into just to encapsulate in our mind just for a moment or to to to gather our thoughts just for just for a sacred moment in time here that I believe that every one of us here we understand that there is this is a very beautiful season that we're in and I know that I know that Christmas isn't necessarily a happy season for every body because I understand that that they are there that are some that are amongst us that have lost family members in this season there are there are some that are amongst us that have have lost children during this time and it could be a very sad time and and it could be a time where men have men have maybe had hard feelings about one another or and they don't want to gather get together as family as as they should and but maybe if just for a moment that you could indulge me just maybe to grab the attention grab the attention of our little ones that are amongst us but I believe that everyone here especially us young people or or children that we envision we envision Christmas as it's coming as it comes into its season as Mortals we we expect or we envision Christmas in in the spiritual and in the in the natural we we we we envision what Christmas is going to be like I can remember as a child growing up what it what it was like even though even though we wouldn't necessarily we wouldn't necessarily have Christmas in our home because we didn't want to offend our Papa Charlie that didn't necessarily believe in everything about Christmas he believed in Christ but he didn't believe in he didn't believe in having Christmas and all of those things but he sure didn't mind getting Christmas presents but God bless his soul but you know we I but I can still remember you know because we didn't want to offend him and his beliefs and those things but but mama still knew how to take care of her children but I can still remember as a little child of the thoughts of Christmas how did it how that it ran through your mind you the excitement that ran through your mind as a child you you just love the you love the very thought of it because because mama was mama was wrapping gifts and Mama wasn't mama was putting popcorn on a tree mama and Mama never did that for us but maybe she maybe she hung some lights on there but we never was that old where we had to hang popcorn on there but but I'd say probably we would have ate it too fast for her to put it up there but but you know we we love that type and that time of season the the the Christmas songs and the lights that the lights that are being shown all over that that are decorated throughout all the decorations they're they're beautiful in their color and you know you can have your ideas about the Christmas lights and and their utensils and all of those things but but you know that we're going to a city where the lamb is the light and if you don't like light you better not go to that City but but we know that there is walls of Jasper in their streets of gold there and and to think that as a little child it's it's a time of Joy it's a it's a time of a time of cheer and a time of fun and to think that it's a time when as you've gathered in you gather in with your family and you you you come in together it was a time when we would travel down the road and we would meet up with family that we hadn't been with for for some season it was a time when you got off from school and you enjoyed those two weeks and you just you enjoyed all of those things and you begin to look that there was those there was those little presents that Mom or Grandma or or granddaddy had put underneath the Christmas tree there for you and and you could go over as a little child and you'd grab that grass Christmas present and you'd shake it with everything Within You Without Mama seeing that you was doing it because you were trying to figure out what was in there mama had a way of wrapping those things so that you knew it wasn't a basketball in there or or you knew it wasn't a baseball bat she knew how to wrap those things and you look forward to that and I I still look forward to it even when Katie ain't looking maybe I'll go over and shake a box and see if I can find out what's on the inside of it but it's a time where it's a time and a season where everybody's saying Merry Christmas and and I can remember maybe even asking our parents if if we could just ask open one present before Christmas you know maybe just indulge me or maybe just let me let me let me open one present you know it won't spoil the fun for me mama just just let me but let me open that one and you can imagine as a child the anticipation the anticipation as a child expecting Christmas to come it's a time when maybe maybe as as as as the older ones would sit around and they'll talk about the old stories it's a time when they'll reflect about Christmas they'll reflect about Christmas in the past and think about sitting around the fireplace with their mother and their father and maybe they've done gone on and went to be with the Lord but they sat around and they'll maybe tell stories at Christmas time you'll be amazed what you'll hear from from an older generation when you get them around food and you get there get there get their belly full they'll begin to tell stories and you begin to think about that settling around the fireplace and maybe maybe burning the trash off the presents and the the boxes and all those things and watching it go into the fireplace and drinking hot chocolate and maybe I hope you're getting a vision of what I'm talking about just now and sitting around in heaven having coffee with one another maybe eating those Christmas cookies that honey honey had baked for you and she'd done stuck them in the oven and man and maybe she just got out those Christmas honey buns for you and things are just things are just right things are just right in the home and maybe the kids are playing around your feet they've got their new games out there they're asking you to get batteries for them and you're just sitting around but that's not Christmas at it as a whole we enjoy all those things but as real Christians we understand the the the the the the the season that we're in that it's not just about those things but it's about the very one that gave us this Christmas gift that we can understand the power of giving to others and to think that that those that have set around and enjoyed and maybe maybe you haven't enjoyed that and if you haven't enjoyed getting a Christmas gift if you ain't got a Christmas gift I pray you come see me and I'll make sure that you get one in understandment with a little bit of Liberty I hope you understand but I want to make sure that's why we try to do our best as as a church to make sure that everybody understands the power of Christmas is a beautiful thing but it ain't just about sitting around the fireplace and drinking hot chocolate to me it was a time setting around the fireplace and hearing about what the prophet did and hearing about what our Lord Jesus Christ did hearing about tumors leaving and hearing about things of of days gone by when when granddaddy would go out and he would have he would have he would have tent meetings or he would go out and he would go to this place and we would reflect about what Christ had done to me that's Christmas to me it's not necessarily to me it's not necessarily about all the things that are going on and and the things and the busyness of life but to me Christmas is all about Christ to me to me this is one of the greatest season the greatest opportunities and many of us will have a great Christmas season I'd say that every one of us I think we're okay here I think we're I think we're okay that that that that that we have family that look out for us that try to make sure that that you don't go without and it's not necessarily just about what you have it's about the things that God has given you it's about the things that maybe you don't even see that God's given you to me that's Christmas many of us will have many of us will have a very decorated and a wonderful season but can you imagine just for a minute and begin to Envision the very first Christmas you begin to think about the very first Christmas that there ever was it's not necessarily A Christmas like we were set here today but it was a Christmas where they had went out a decree by Caesar Augustus that all the world would be taxed that all the world would be taxed and here Joseph was heading down to Bethlehem you see what was happening was Vision Vision was leading them down to Bethlehem you see you see they they were being led there even though Caesar Augustus had had sent out a decree that all the world was going to be taxed yet prophecy was leading them down to Bethlehem and to think about as as many of you mothers understand this understand the carrying the carrying of a child but you went maybe in an ambulance or maybe you went by your husband carrying you to the hospital but Mary the very first Christmas was riding on the backside of a donkey Mary was riding over the deserts over the deserts from Judea all the way from Galilee over to Bethlehem and we understand that by by tradition and men that have been there that there's a great Hill that goes that goes straight up and it goes over and and Joseph and Joseph is leading this leading this donkey and Mary riding this donkey being ready to bring forth the Little Child Jesus and here is the very first Christmas that is coming into play and all of these all of these things that she's and she's riding it and you can understand the agony that her body is in what is she doing she's about to give birth to Christmas to everybody that is sitting here she is about to give birth to the to the one that is going to save the people from their sins and to think that they're going up this Trail and and the road is the road is very Rocky and there's there's camel trails that are leading around Judea and they're coming up and brother random said that there is a there's a great Rock there that's about the third of the size of a building that we're in he said he said he said there he said they begin to stop up there at that rock and Mary got off Mary got off for the donkey and said Joseph I see you're real tired right here why don't you maybe just ride for a little bit he said oh honey I'm not going to do that you get back on there we'll write down through there but you see Jesus had predestinated all things about his coming and about his going and here the very first Christmas he was riding on a donkey as he's coming into Bethlehem and Joseph begins to look down over the hill over in the city of Bethlehem and there is a bunch of there's a bunch of people down there and Joseph begins to say to Mary Mary I do not believe that we're going to be able to get a hotel tonight there's so many people that has come in because of the taxation of the world because of Caesar Augustus I just don't believe that we're going to be able to get in there you see God had a vision in his mind of where he wanted his child to be born at in the world for a lamb to be born in but in a Manger you see it wouldn't be fitting for a lamb to be born on the inside of a pink decorated hospital room but a lamb had to come to a Manger where he felt comfortable of being there but as Joseph is up there at that rock and Mary is beginning to rest up there and she's she's resting up there and looking at all of these things and Joseph begins to drift back and he says Mary he said do you recognize have you have you noticed that star over there you you see that star over there and it seems like it's it seems like it's been following us and and do you see all of those things and when Joseph looked back to Mary her eyes were in amazement she said Joseph I have watched that ever since we left Judea you see there was a star that had been following them because there was scripture that was laying there you see that which was laying there in the scripture was a vision that was getting ready to become a reality because the Bible says said that where there is no vision the people perish but there was a star that was rising out of Jacob that would lead them to a place that where the very first Christmas that there ever would be and here the very amazement of Christmas was upon Mary's face as his star is looking she said I have I've seen that all throughout our journey I've seen it hanging there yonder what do you think that means Joseph what was it what was prophecy was now becoming fulfilled and what was becoming fulfilled was now a reality do you recognize that you and I have a vision of what Christmas is going to be like we have an understandment that we're going to get together maybe with your family you have an arrangement that you're going to get together maybe at 12 o'clock in the day and maybe you exchange some gifts and have a family meal and go over devotions but do you realize that God had a vision for Christmas but you see his vision is isn't like our vision his vision was to free his people from the grip of the law right out of the jaws of death and the show to Satan that he was the Lord over all the Earth to show that he owned all the cattle on a thousand hills do you recognize that Caesar Augustus could have never gave out that decree unless God had already thought about it but you recognized that many years ago that God had a conference he had a conference and brother said that he he had a conference whether there would be a Christmas or not he said but there was a conference made in heaven what this Plan of Redemption would be and he said it was a decided by God that he would become a man and that he would come down and take his own curse upon himself and it would not be fair he said it wouldn't be fair for him to send an angel he said it wouldn't be fair for him to send any other person he said even if he had a boy he would not be fair for him to send his boy he said it would not be fair for me to sin or make my Joseph suffer for the things of my own judgment he said I wouldn't be just in doing so he said if I passed my judgment he said want to redeem it he said the only thing that I can do is suffer it for myself he said that's the sign he said that's the Deathstroke to Satan he said now my Catholic brother he said also many of my Protestants he said I'm not hurting you but you try to make Jesus a little Lesser God than God making him a little Lesser God he said you could elf his feet and you bring him down just a little bit under the head of God and make him a Lesser God and you're so wrong he said Jesus was a man he called himself the son of man he said that was the death blow to the devil you see there was a conference in heaven years ago that Jesus that God said I'm not going to send an angel down I'm not going to send Abel down I'm going down there myself to think that you and I wouldn't understand the power of redemption unless that conference had took place that there was going to be a Christmas do you recognize that God had a conference in heaven that there was going to be a Christmas so that you can understand the power of giving so that you can understand the power of redemption and the understanding the power of the blood of Jesus Christ that saves you from the grip of sin of all the mistakes in your life that that held bound you held you Bound by your DNA markers of things that were laying there maybe things that maybe things that you couldn't get out of but because there was a conference that he said there was going to be a Christmas he allowed us to catch the vision that there would be a Christmas that he would come he would be born like a man you see if there would have been no Christmas there have been no cross if there had been no cross there would have been No Grave if there would have been no Christmas there would have been no Resurrection if there'd been no Christmas there'd have been no Redemption if there had been no Christmas there'd have been no Rapture thank God that he had a conference that we could have a Christmas and God had a way that he was going to unwrap his Christmas present God had a plan it's amazing that you know we we spend time and we spend time we got our list together we got to listen together how things are going to go out and what we're going to pick out for everybody but God already had a plan about how he was going to get you out of this whole chaos before you ever got here and he decided to wrap the greatest Christmas gift on the inside of a womb of the little girl by the name of Mary that God had an escape plan on the inside of that little Mary that was riding on that donkey up there when it didn't look like anybody had the Christmas spirit down there nobody wanted Jesus down there nobody wanted him in the end because they were already full but you see there is a people in the land today they are wanting to give him room and give him access to the throne room of their heart that's the vision of Christmas and here this little girl she was meditating on the scripture that was laying there the random said that that it was Joseph and Mary's tradition it was their tradition on Sunday evenings to go out and to have a little bible study here here is here's Joseph and Mary espouse to be married and they're having a Bible study I believe we can get a good lesson right there mother Madam I think it's amazing that brother Brandon would give us the insight to be able to look back all the way those 2000 years ago and look into Mary's life and to see that see that she'd went in there and she goes in there and grabs a scroll she goes in there and grabs a scroll and brings it out to Joseph and Joseph begins to read it as it begins he begins to read over in Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 For unto us a son is born unto us a child is given and she asked Joseph brother and said she asked Joseph can you read that again can you read that again he said something something about that scripture had stuck out to mix it stuck out to Mary he said that that scripture seemed to grip that little child that little 16 year old girl and he said she couldn't get away from that scripture he said what is it referring to it's referring that there was a messiah that was to come and directly after that she just read the scripture brother random said that she was walking down a little dusty road and she was going down through there and he said she had her mind she had her mind on the things of God and she was thinking she was she was thinking about these things she wasn't even noticing what was around her but she was thinking about the promises that God had laid out in the scripture mother random said that she didn't even notice who was standing around her and he said as she was thinking all of a sudden there it appeared a light and out of that light step to a six-footed man by the name of Gabriel and he said Hail Mary fear not for thou Hast found favor with God you see because he had kept her mind on what God had said now God had chose little Mary before the foundation of the world but the elect of God keep God on their mind at all times and she kept God on her mind she was thinking on these promises and out of those promises stepped an angel out of that promise stepped an angel and he began to speak to her the very things of Life brother random said if you want angels to appear to you keep your mind on God and off the things of the world he said go about your business go to church go to washing your clothes wherever you are whatever you are keep your mind on him all day and all night he said then God will do something to think that there she was rolling over those scriptures in her mind foreign I'm trying my best I'm trying my best to paint you a picture but the preacher in me wants to bra he wants to jump out right here I'm gonna try my best to hold him back but I don't think I don't think y'all gonna allow me to but just to think that she's allowing these scriptures to roll over her mind she's letting these scriptures roll over her mind she can't get away from him something has gripped that virgin that she can't get away from it and she what did it do the scripture that had been released to her in that season now notice there is a thousand other marriage out there there's a thousand other people out there by the name of Mary there's another thousand people out there had already read that scripture but this was the Mary that God had foreordained Hallelujah before the foundation of the world that she would be a virgin don't you see what this bride is in this day she's espoused to one husband she's got a virgin she's got a virgin womb hurts she's virgin in her mind she's virgin in her soul she's virgin in a womb and she's not been manhandled she's not been put aside she's not given over to man's intellects but the seed of almighty God has trapped on the inside of her heart and the virgin that's bringing forth the same son of man again today what was it because she had her mind because she had her mind on the supernatural it moved her body into the supernatural don't you realize what the son of man has done in this generation because you have kept your mind stayed on almighty God it will move your body right into the supernatural there's another Mary in the land that knows what he does once done with the Lord and because she's kept her mind a Malachi 4 because she's kept her mind on the seventh star it will change her body Mary don't you worry about this don't you worry about everybody else is going to say about you don't you worry about what they say about my message that I'm bringing to you because my message is from the Holy Ghost Mary I want you to understand that you are the very first one that is going to experience this Mary I want you to understand that that which is being conceived on the inside of you is the Holy Ghost let me tell you Jesus ain't got two Gods he ain't got two fathers he is birthed by the Holy Ghost and you ain't got two fathers you've been born again by the power of the Holy Ghost [Applause] she begins to she begins to tell Joseph you imagine what this is like he ain't here he's back here you imagine bro Seth Sister Sarah Beth comes to you said look baby I got this little bump I don't know it's gonna be a little hard for you to understand but it ain't the sweet potato casserole where's your brother Seth is going to take your breath away you ain't gonna believe this I know it's gonna be hard for you to believe but I met an angel and that angel told me that I was going to bring forth a son and we were to call his name Jesus now I can't explain everything to you Joseph foreign but that which is born on the inside of me is of the Holy Ghost and brother random said that Joseph was such a Believer he said he wanted to believe her he said but the thing was it was so unusual he said it was so unusual that he just he couldn't understand it and he wanted he was a just man he said I don't want her to be stoned I know what the law said about this that if a woman is caught outside if she's caught outside that she's going to be stoned to death by the law I'm a believer of the law and he's thinking up but this thing is so unusual but you think tonight that God has a way of revealing the unusual to those that have their minds stayed on him and Joseph kept his mind upon the Lord and he said and he began to talk about these things and the Bible said that while he was thinking on these things the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream now you realize that he couldn't come to him in a vision because there was no prophet in that day anybody came to him in a secondarily way he came to him he came to him in a dream but he didn't have to worry about understanding the dream because the dream wasn't in symbols because the angel Gabriel laid out all the details of the birth don't you recognize that the very message that Mary was preaching to Joseph the angel Gabriel brought the same message Hallelujah don't you understand that what William Branham broke was the same thing that Paul brought was the same thing that's being brought to you tonight the angel knows how to bring a message to a woman Joseph chose to be her protector is chosen by almighty God to protect her throughout throughout this prophecy it is given his charge to watch over her and he said he he said you know I know it's an unusual story for you and it's the unusual thing and I know that you're all tore up about this Joseph but that which is being done on the inside of her is the Holy Ghost don't you understand that the people that the reason why so many people around this message are shook up and tore up it's because the Holy Ghost is working in a body again and so many people are getting so Disturbed and so upset because they're not seeing they acts to in operation in their Church and they think well we're just a bunch of Pentecostals down here Full Gospel Lighthouse I beg to differ with you what you're tore up about is the Holy Ghost I know it may seem unusual that you might get into a conventional atmosphere and all of a sudden an eagle screams out an eagle screams out what is it it's this type of atmosphere where eagles are born at and you see the angel Gabriel couldn't meet Mary just in any circum Place certain place it had to be where the atmosphere was right and she set the Atmosphere by her faith and her faith brought the angel down and the angel brought the blessing don't you recognize what you're doing you are bringing the angel to your situation and Christ is born again in you forgive me I'm not a very good artist but Joseph was going to assist in Prophecy to bring to fulfillment what God had in his mind that he was going to be a protector he recognized what the angel was doing he was sowing out to Joseph that you are to be a protector of the anointing now notice notice there's prophecies and I ain't got time to read it to you all tonight but I'll just maybe preface some of it but there was prophecy that was laying there throughout all the Old Testament about the birth of Jesus Christ that Jesus would be The Offspring of the woman and she shall bruise he shall bruise the Serpent's head in Genesis 3 and 14 but the Bible tells us in Galatians 4 but when the fullness of time was come a God sent for the son made of a woman what was it that which was prophecy was now made a reality the Hebrews 2 and 14 tells us that God sent for the son made of a woman made under the law excuse me I just read that again to you that through the death that he might destroy him the Bible said in First John 3 and 8 that the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil there was scripture laying there that all nations would be blessed through Abraham there was scripture laying there that Jesus was to be born in the town of Bethlehem of Judea which was laying there in Micah chapter five and two and it was fulfilled in Matthew Chapter 2 and 1. there was scripture a prophecy laying there that Jesus was to be born a king of the line of David and it was fulfilled there was scripture laying there that the Messiah would be child would be a child to be born which is Isaiah 9 and 6 which was fulfilled in Luke 2 and 11. and there is scripture laying there that the Christ will be born of a virgin Isaiah 7 and 3 which was fulfilled in the Virgin Mary in Luke chapter 1 and verse 26. there was scripture laying there that Kings would bring him gifts and fall down before him Psalm 72 and 10 and it was fulfilled when the wise men or the magi's in Matthew Chapter 2 when they came and laid down their gifts unto him of gold frankincense and myrrh there was scripture laying there that the Messiah would be of the seed of Jacob that hero would rise a star out of Jacob of numbers 24 and 17 and it was fulfilled in our Lord Jesus Christ there was scripture laying there that Jesus was to be a rod out of the stem of Jesse Isaiah 11 and it was fulfilled in our Lord Jesus Christ there was scripture laying there in Jeremiah 31 of a massacre of children after Jesus was born and you remember what Herod did what was he trying to do he was trying to stop the very birth of Jesus Christ from getting into the world what was Satan trying to do he was trying to stop Christmas what was Satan trying to do he was trying to kill out every influence of the Messiah getting on Earth you watch what Satan is trying to do he's tried again to attack you in your strength he's trying to kill out the birthright he's trying to kill out your experience there was scripture laying there in Micah chapter 5 and verse 2 that Jesus would be the ruler over all of Israel and he would be from Everlasting to Everlasting and the Bible tells us that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God I'd say that Jesus fulfilled that there's prophecy after prophecy that was laying there that this was to be the one that was to come there was prophecy laying there that Jesus was to be born of the tribe of Judah and that's exactly what the Bible said in Genesis 14 or 49 and 8 through 10 that Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies and the fathers thy children shall bowed him before thee Judaism from the prey my son Thou Art gone up he stood up he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall raise him up the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet unto shallow come and unto him shall the Gathering of the people D people be notice what Micah 5 and 2 says Thou though thou be little amongst the thousands of Judah to think that this that God would choose a place by the name of Bethlehem that was established by the mother Ruth foreign hallelujah what was it the Bible tells us that it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah it is evident that the Bible gives us a genealogy in Matthew chapter 1 laying out the lineage or the genealogy of our Lord Jesus Christ that he would pass through Judah he would beget say rest that was of steam heart to think that God would choose a lineage that was so corrupt to bring Christmas but he had to come out of Judah but the Bible said in Revelations 5 and one of the elders saith unto me weak not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof don't you realize that where I have taken you is down and a road of Emmaus that prophecy is made clear that modern events are made clear by prophecy all of this wrapped up in one child there's a hundred more I could give you they didn't want him in herod's house they didn't want him at the end they didn't want him down at the church of Christ but he found the place that he was destined to be born at you see even in your own life something was calling you all of your life it seemed like as a little child that you didn't want to do things like other children wanted to do you didn't want to have a part of their dirty games or the dirty jokes you didn't want to have a part of their ideas of what fun was it was something that was laying on the inside of you which we know is a gene seed of God mother Branham would take a text from Psalms chapter 42 on a deep cause to the Deep and to think that there was something that was yearning on the inside of you you remember when brother brother Brown would tell about that little boy he was lacking sulfur in his body he'd got to eat in bicycle bicycle pedals tell you what that'd have been a sight to see right there but it was something on the inside of him that was calling I'm sorry I envisioned something right there you imagine Gabriel lacking sulfur in his body and going out and on a bunch of bicycle pedals all the Mennonites they ain't peddling nowhere this weekend laughs well this is Christmas wow forgive me but something on the inside of me he said before there could been a fence on a Fishback he said there had to be water for him to swim in and before you could ever find your way to the Lord Jesus Christ he had to Prevail a way for you to get to him and when Satan would try with all of his power to keep you from all the the power of Christmas and the power of our Lord Jesus Christ he had already provided a way for you to get to him and to think that that there was there was people that had been looking for him for thousands of years Moses testified of him Isaiah testified of him even the Magi that were over there over there in the countries they were they were looking up there and brother banham said that brother Bantam said that they were watching the stars and they they'd study the stars he said we would call them astrologer in the states he said but they studied the stars and they looked at all the stars and they they were watching and they they were sitting there and each brother said that they grabbed over out of the Book of Daniel and they began to read out of Daniel that he would there would be a stone cut out of the mountain and he they began to read over that and they were reflecting over it and there they were sitting around their sacred fires he said they were sitting around there and he said all of a sudden they begin to look up at the skies and he said there was a stranger in the skies he said they began to look up there into the skies and they couldn't find where they they took all the notes they took all the measurements and said look there's a new star up there there's something strange about that star up there we don't have this documented brother random said they seen that there was a strange repair let me put it to you like this when the seventh star came into view in this generation there was people that looked out and said there's a star there's a stranger player and we don't understand how it got here but we are reflected we are to go to that story do you think to understand that tonight that before the Seven Star could be released it had to be in the hand of our Lord Jesus Christ and before it could grab your attention to run to Malachi 4 and see Revelations 10 that they are the Son of God had looked on you to think that this star would lead those wise men to a little bitty child that would be the Messiah of the whole world and to think this seventh star has led us through the evening light that'll lead us that'll lead us right into a rapture you forgive me but that's Christmas you forgive me but Malachi 4 brought the greatest Christmas gift that I've ever known in all of my life when he brought to me the revealed word an unsealed book A book that's been opened so that I can understand what's on the inside of the gift [Applause] it passed over every Observatory but it came by their way there could have been more than three but the Bible tells us that there was three gifts that was brought to him this wasn't some Santa Claus makeup this was not some myth but all of these gifts had details of his birth had details of his life and details of his death God has a way of bringing his gifts to the body so that it reflects him this Christmas this Christmas there's going to be a bride in preview and if it's going to be set out previews before it goes on display and a bride is coming into preview and this Christmas I wonder are you reflecting what Christmas is we enjoy the lights we enjoy the presents but what has been unwrapped before you is the gift of salvation the gift to never walk back to the life that you once know the gift to leave leave anxiety where it's at the gift to leave all of your burdens of losing a loved one a losing a family member this gift that has been unwrapped before your eyes is our Lord Jesus Christ you remember you remember that little child that was standing he had never seen a mirror before and he went over there to a family's home that had him here and you remember what the little boy did he looked at it and he thought he wanted to play with that little boy he was looking at him he'd move and he'd move he'd talk back to him he'd come to find out that was him in the mirror this Christmas did they see all you're giving or do they see Chris Christ do they see the seventh seal in you do they see Christ The Mystery of God revealed in you do they see what this message is in you if we're going to be on display I want to display him in all of his attributes it's a beautiful season it's a beautiful season and we enjoy sitting around and taking our turn unwrapping our present but what if this year you're sitting there and you have your morning devotion before you go into your unwrapping of gifts and you have your family time of prayer and all of a sudden appears your loved one to think about all that this message has meant to you and and what it's done how it's brought you so many miracles there's a portion that I I've not got here too but you think about all the Miracles that are been stacked up in this just this church and there are so many connections across the world that that we we could testify of but do you think about what those were was gifts from God there's a story there's a story about about it's just a story but there's these great big conveyor belt in heaven and all these presents are going out across this conveyor belt it's a bunch of little gifts going and there's a conveyor belt of big gifts over there and it seems to be just setting Steel and the conveyor belt of little gifts keeps going out going out going out going out that none of the big gifts go out finally somebody asked so why why aren't those big gifts going out and God said well nobody asked for those things they always ask for the little ones don't be afraid to ask for big things you know I never did hurt to ask Mama to get another another Mustang again I didn't get it but it didn't hurt to ask It Don't Hurt Now to ask Katie if I can have another one I got it when it don't hurt to ask I've asked every single day for the past three years for the Lord to heal my daddy I ain't got it yet but I believe it's getting ready to be dropped off the conveyor belt [Applause] I hope you were able to capturing my broken up words just just for a moment of what the vision of Christmas was what we Vision it as and what God Visions it as but what God Visions it as today not a baby in a Manger but the Dynamics on
