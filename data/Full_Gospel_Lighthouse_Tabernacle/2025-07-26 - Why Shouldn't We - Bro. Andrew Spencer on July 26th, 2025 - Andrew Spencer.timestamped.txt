[30:45] What a friend I found in you,

[31:03] promise.
[31:06] I can always count on you.

[35:16] Cuz every time I lean into his goodness,
[35:24] I'm reminded that I'm never alone.
[35:32] And if I know that Jesus is the answer
[35:41] and he's already done what must be done,
[35:48] why wouldn't I run?
[35:52] Why would I run?
[35:56] Why would I go to my father
[36:01] and rest in his love? How could I stay
[36:09] here in this place
[36:14] when he's waiting? Arms wide open
[36:18] with his amazing grace.
[36:23] And I can hear it calling me to come.
[36:30] Why wouldn't I run
[36:43] and he has been the friend that I have
[36:48] needed.
[36:52] who shown me mercy I did not deserve.
[37:01] Forgiving me for every time I failed him
[37:09] and took a cross to show me what I'm
[37:13] worth.
[37:18] Because I know that Jesus is the answer
[37:27] and he's already done what must be done.
[37:34] How would I run?
[37:39] I would not run.
[37:43] Why would I go to my father
[37:49] and rest in his love? How could I stay
[37:57] here in this place?
[38:02] And he's waiting, arms wide open
[38:06] with his amazing grace.
[38:11] I can hear him calling me to come.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Why wouldn't I run?
[38:23] Why wouldn't I run
[38:29] if hope is calling out my name? If I
[38:34] don't have to be afraid. If he's already
[38:39] made a way, what am I waiting for?
[38:47] Why wouldn't I run?
[38:52] Why wouldn't I run?
[38:56] Why wouldn't I go to my father
[39:02] and rest in his love? How could I stay
[39:10] here in this place
[39:15] when he's waiting arms wide open
[39:19] with his amazing grace?
[39:24] When I can hear him calling out to come.
[39:33] Oh, I can hear him calling me to come.
[39:41] Why wouldn't I run?
[39:45] Why wouldn't I run?
[39:53] [Music]
[39:56] [Applause]
[40:13] I think the next time I sing, I'm going
[40:15] to have Andrew to sing with me.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:24] I would like to thank you. and I will do
[40:26] more in the morning, but I'd like to
[40:28] thank you for the 25th anniversary
[40:30] celebration.
[40:33] Well, you're a secretive bunch of people
[40:39] and
[40:42] had pulled a rehab on me
[40:46] and uh
[40:50] I got to missing that afternoon. I got
[40:53] to missing a couple of trophies and
[40:56] and Connie told me, she said, "Matthew's
[41:00] going to use it in a presentation.
[41:05] You know, I just bought it.
[41:09] I just bought it."
[41:11] And so Andrew had told me to come to Yak
[41:15] to give the young people a talking to
[41:17] about how to behave at Ohio meeting. And
[41:20] I bought it.
[41:23] I I just bought it. I thought, "Well,
[41:25] that's" And he told me, he said, "Dress
[41:27] nice." So, I put on a golf shirt, pair
[41:30] of pants, and I bought it.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; When did I know when I saw you?
[41:39] I'd like to thank each and every one of
[41:41] you. Maybe I didn't get to shake all of
[41:43] your hands or get a picture with
[41:44] everybody, but you made me feel really
[41:47] good. And so,
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so if I get to be here with
[41:52] you a couple more years, Andrew's
[41:53] already started on his time clock. I
[41:55] think he's already got How many years
[41:57] you've already gotten? So
[42:00] 15 years this year, so maybe I can stick
[42:04] around for his 25th. And so I'd like to
[42:07] do that. We certainly love you with all
[42:09] of our hearts and so glad to see each
[42:11] and every one of you. We're glad to have
[42:12] brother Joel's
[42:14] father and mother and with us tonight.
[42:17] And amen. I'm so glad to see them.
[42:22] I know you
[42:24] and I'd like to call your name, but I
[42:26] it's just not it's not going to pop up
[42:28] on the computer, but but I know where
[42:31] you're from. So that you know, God knows
[42:34] where you're from, too.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're so glad to have you guys
[42:38] with us and we certainly love you with
[42:40] all of our hearts and so glad. Amen.
[42:43] Sister Deborah, that's they're from your
[42:44] home country up there, aren't they?
[42:46] Yeah. Yeah. I'm not guessing. I think we
[42:49] had lunch together. And so, Amen. So
[42:51] glad to have you guys with us. Amen.
[42:54] Look over at your neighbor. Say, "We're
[42:55] glad you're here."
[43:00] Amen.
[43:02] Amen.
[43:05] I have a wonderful opportunity tonight
[43:07] to
[43:09] dedicate a wonderful addition to this
[43:11] church.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; And uh
[43:17] And uh we're so glad to have brother
[43:19] Joey and Sister Faith with us and uh
[43:23] time's clicking for them as well. And
[43:25] they've been here with us for a bit. And
[43:27] so we're just so glad to have them. And
[43:30] and they're worried about how their
[43:32] little daughter will react tonight while
[43:34] I dedicate
[43:36] little brother. And so we've seen
[43:39] everything in these baby dedications. So
[43:41] I told them not to worry about that
[43:43] whatsoever. But we want to congratulate
[43:46] them tonight with all of our heart. They
[43:48] welcome their second child and and now
[43:51] they want to dedicate it. And you know,
[43:53] we as a body believers gather in the
[43:55] presence of the Lord and we believe
[43:57] God's here. Jesus himself would take
[44:00] time to dedicate babies and and then
[44:02] even brother Brandham and his busy
[44:04] schedule of delivering delivering the
[44:07] message. Many times the local people
[44:10] would wait for up to two years before
[44:12] they could have their babies dedicated.
[44:14] And so, but it was important. And then,
[44:16] Brother Brandham would take time and and
[44:18] I know you're probably like me, you fast
[44:21] forward it through those baby
[44:22] dedications and and whether there's
[44:24] sometimes there's 10 or 12 baby
[44:26] dedications and he goes one to another.
[44:29] But you know who it's important to?
[44:31] &gt;&gt; That mom and dad.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham knew that. And if
[44:35] Jesus took the time and he took the
[44:38] time, I think we can surely do that as
[44:40] well.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; In Psalms chapter 127 and verse three
[44:44] said, "Children are the heritage of the
[44:46] Lord.
[44:48] Offspring
[44:50] are a reward from them." in Deuteronomy
[44:54] chapter 6 and verse 5 said, "Love the
[44:58] Lord
[45:00] with your whole heart
[45:02] and with all your soul and with all your
[45:04] strength.
[45:06] These commandments
[45:09] are to be in your hearts and press them
[45:12] upon your children." I'm sorry, I
[45:14] paraphrased that. And Psalms chapter 22
[45:17] and verse 6 says, "Train up a child in
[45:20] the way that he should go and when he is
[45:22] old, he will not depart from it." And we
[45:25] have seen that scripture be fulfilled.
[45:30] I'm living at part of that.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Psalms 127 and verse three. Lo
[45:37] heritage of the Lord and the fruit of
[45:40] the womb is his reward. As arrows are in
[45:44] the hand of a mighty man, so are
[45:46] children of the youth.
[45:50] Happy is the man that hath his quiver
[45:53] full of them. They shall not be ashamed,
[45:57] but they shall speak
[45:59] with the enemies in the gate. Amen.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Joey and
[46:05] Sister Faith. And Amen. Could you just
[46:08] come and Amen.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:13] Sing that chorus. Bring them in. Bring
[46:15] them in.
[46:17] Bring them in.
[46:21] Bring them in.
[46:25] Bring
[46:28] from the fields
[46:31] of sin.
[46:33] Bring them in.
[46:37] Bring them in.
[46:41] Bring
[46:43] the little ones to Jesus.
[46:50] What do you think about this guy? Yeah.
[46:54] That's your brother. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[46:58] Yeah.
[47:00] Amen. Amen. You love him?
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Did you just tell them to take him
[47:07] back?
[47:12] God bless you,
[47:13] &gt;&gt; brother Joy.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Sister Faith,
[47:17] &gt;&gt; congratulations to you both. The Lord
[47:19] has blessed you. It's blessed you in
[47:21] your life and we count this as another
[47:25] eternal blessing. We don't believe this
[47:27] is just temporary for this life, but
[47:29] it's believe it's eternal
[47:32] today. We believe this is part of
[47:36] Corbin's journey into eternity. Stepped
[47:40] out of eternity into time and you're a
[47:43] mom and dad. You'll take care of him.
[47:45] God gives you responsibility to watch
[47:47] over him and teach him. You're his
[47:50] pastor at home. you'll teach him about
[47:53] the Lord and read Bible stories to him
[47:55] and and you'll be the rod of correction
[47:58] and be his buddy and be his friend and
[48:02] and God's blessed you and brother Joy
[48:05] and and and we see the blessings of God
[48:07] on him and isn't it wonderful that we
[48:10] can see the blessings of God now Corbin
[48:14] Joseph has been blessed with life and so
[48:18] now we do this to dedicate him back to
[48:21] the Lord Lord. Amen.
[48:24] Father,
[48:26] as I have taken Corb and Joseph into my
[48:28] hands,
[48:31] Lord, as they would dedicate Jesus at
[48:33] the temple, I stand here and dedicate
[48:36] another attribute of God that you have
[48:39] placed in the earth. Now, Father, as
[48:42] they've laid him into my hands, I give
[48:45] him into your hands.
[48:47] I'm asking you that you would watch over
[48:49] him and protect him. I pray that you
[48:52] would bless his life.
[48:55] Lord, I pray that you would protect him
[48:57] when harm would come. May the angels of
[49:00] God stand present.
[49:02] Do a supernatural work for him,
[49:06] Lord. As he time comes, I pray that you
[49:08] would give him a new birth, Lord. And
[49:11] may the spirit of Jesus Christ live on
[49:15] the inside of him. Thank you for
[49:17] blessing brother Joey and sister Faith.
[49:21] What a wonderful God that you are how
[49:23] you care for us and love us. And we pray
[49:26] that you would bless him with life and
[49:28] strength and mercy. In the name of Jesus
[49:32] Christ, we pray in your name I ask you
[49:36] do a work for him. In your name I pray.
[49:39] Amen and amen. Amen. Isn't he a
[49:42] beautiful little boy? Yes.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You guys step up here and we'll
[49:46] take pictures.
[49:47] Amen.
[49:50] That's all right. She'll change you in a
[49:52] minute.
[49:59] [Music]
[50:01] He's got a reason to scream.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister F. We so love you
[50:08] with all of our hearts. God bless you.
[50:10] God bless you. Amen. You be careful now.
[50:13] Amen.
[50:14] Give them a good hand this evening.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; No, I'm not going to sing like you sing
[50:28] before you introduce me. So,
[50:34] &gt;&gt; let's stand.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Some glad morning when this life is
[50:38] over, I'll fly away. Is that what you're
[50:41] anticipating?
[50:43] Amen. Amen. I'm glad. I'm looking
[50:45] forward to that new body. I'm getting
[50:47] I'm getting wore out with this one. This
[50:48] one's wearing me out today. Well, some
[50:51] glad morning when this life is over.
[50:56] Will I
[50:58] fly away
[51:02] or two?
[51:05] I surrenash your shore. Will I
[51:11] fly away?
[51:14] Will I
[51:17] fly away?
[51:23] my way.
[51:27] Will I
[51:28] die? Hallelujah.
[51:33] Will I
[51:36] fly away? Let's sing that second verse.
[51:39] Oh,
[51:41] the shadows
[51:43] of this life
[51:46] will
[51:48] go to fly away.
[51:52] like a bird from prison and bars and
[51:58] will
[52:01] fly away. Let's sing it with all of our
[52:03] hearts. Will I
[52:06] [Music]
[52:19] die?
[52:21] and you're by
[52:26] going to fly away.
[52:30] Well, just a few more weary days and
[52:35] then
[52:37] I
[52:39] I'm going to fly away
[52:44] to a land where joy shall never end.
[52:50] I'm
[52:52] going to fly away.
[52:56] I'm
[52:59] fly away. Oh, glory.
[53:05] I'll fly away.
[53:12] Hallelujah.
[53:14] Bye bye.
[53:18] Going to fly away.
[53:21] I know it was a blood. I know it was a
[53:26] blood. I know it was a blood for me.
[53:34] One day when I was lost, he died upon
[53:39] the cross. And I know it was the blood
[53:44] for me.
[53:47] Well, there's healing in the blood. Oh,
[53:50] there's healing in the blood. There is
[53:54] healing in the blood for me.
[54:00] One day when I was lost, he died upon a
[54:06] cross. And I know it was the blood for
[54:11] me. And what a mighty God we serve.
[54:17] Oh, what a mighty God we serve.
[54:23] Oh angels bow before him. Heaven and
[54:28] earth adore him. What a mighty God we
[54:33] serve.
[54:36] Oh Jesus is the God we serve.
[54:42] Oh Jesus is the God that I serve.
[54:49] Angels bow before him. Heaven and earth
[54:53] adore him. What a mighty God we serve.
[55:00] [Music]
[55:01] Hallelujah. Aren't you thankful to serve
[55:04] a God like Jesus? Hallelujah.
[55:07] Hallelujah.
[55:09] Amen. If you have your Bibles today,
[55:10] we'd like to look in the book of
[55:12] Hebrews, chapter 13, and verse 8.
[55:24] Just told Brother Ron, it been 15 it's
[55:27] been 15 years since I started
[55:28] ministering. And I tell you what, I feel
[55:31] as nervous as I was preaching for the
[55:33] very first time tonight and just
[55:36] something the Lord laid on my heart
[55:38] about about noon noon today and and uh
[55:42] so we're just going to just take some
[55:44] take some time here this evening and
[55:46] maybe I could express what's on my mind
[55:48] and what the Lord's just dealt with us
[55:50] on. Amen. How many has a need that you'd
[55:52] like to make known unto the Lord
[55:54] tonight? Amen. Amen. God sees your
[55:56] hands. Amen. And I know that we have
[55:59] many here that have many needs in
[56:02] different areas and financial and some
[56:05] physical and spiritual and different
[56:07] things, but I believe our Lord is more
[56:09] than able to reach to the innermost part
[56:11] of your beings and speak directly to us
[56:13] tonight. Do you believe that with all
[56:15] your heart? Amen. Let's just agree
[56:17] together. Father, we come before you
[56:19] tonight, Lord. We humbly bow our hearts
[56:22] before you, Lord Jesus. Realizing,
[56:24] Father, that we have entered into your
[56:27] your courts with praise and thanksgiving
[56:29] upon our lips, Lord Jesus. Lord, to who
[56:32] we owe our entire life, Lord. We
[56:35] realize, Father, that you have allowed
[56:37] us to be a part of this end time
[56:39] message, Father, and you have allowed us
[56:40] to be in into a place, Father, and enter
[56:44] into a place, Lord, where eagles are
[56:46] gathered. And Lord, we realize Lord that
[56:48] that we see that the word is here. Lord,
[56:50] the eagles are gathering here. And we
[56:52] ask, Father, that tonight that you would
[56:54] just move amongst us in a very specific
[56:56] and special way. There's such a sweet
[56:58] presence here tonight. And Lord, we just
[57:01] would ask that you would come, that
[57:03] Jesus would feel welcome in this room,
[57:05] that Jesus would come by and minister to
[57:08] us. Lord, you you went by you went by
[57:11] the place of Jarius when his daughter
[57:13] was in a in a condition, Father, that
[57:15] nobody could help. But Lord, you came.
[57:18] And I believe that you're still the same
[57:19] yesterday, today, and forever. And we
[57:21] would ask, Father, that's a day that you
[57:23] would just sweep through this
[57:24] congregation tonight and you would
[57:26] minister to them in a very specific way.
[57:28] Father, our our hearts are yours. I pray
[57:32] that you just set us aside just now in
[57:34] Jesus name. Amen. Hebrews chapter 13 and
[57:37] verse 8 is very familiar to us, but we
[57:40] would like to just read it together
[57:42] tonight. Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[57:46] and today and forever. May God bless his
[57:49] word. You may be seated here tonight in
[57:51] the presence of the Lord. I'd like to
[57:54] just take a little thought, three words
[57:56] on why shouldn't we?
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we? And I I know that
[58:01] there's many of things that we could
[58:03] minister on on why we shouldn't. And
[58:06] there's there's definitely a lot of area
[58:08] that we could cover there. Well, we got
[58:10] a good squeaky toy in here tonight. And
[58:12] and there's definitely we could say why
[58:14] shouldn't we have squeaky toys? But
[58:16] tonight, I want to
[58:19] praise the Lord.
[58:21] I just like to minister on those three
[58:23] words. Why shouldn't we?
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we? And there's there's a
[58:29] vast way that we could take this
[58:30] tonight. But I think it's so powerful
[58:33] when you begin to think about how the
[58:35] messenger of this age would come and he
[58:38] would take this scripture and he would
[58:39] over and over and over again he would
[58:42] repeat it to us. And I believe that the
[58:45] reason that you and I can have the
[58:47] ability to trust in God's perseverance
[58:50] is because that he never changes. Is
[58:53] that he always remains the same. And if
[58:56] if he was an unpredictable God or
[58:59] constantly changing, if he helped one
[59:02] person today and he abandoned them the
[59:04] very next day, if he loved what was
[59:06] right one day and he loved what was evil
[59:09] the very next day, or if he made a plan
[59:12] yesterday and then he decided to give it
[59:14] up today, then you and I could not trust
[59:16] him in the manner that he desires us to
[59:19] trust him in. we couldn't know him or we
[59:22] couldn't know what to expect from a God
[59:24] that is constantly changing or or or
[59:27] honestly just coming up with different
[59:29] ideas. You and I would not have the
[59:31] ability to follow him like you and I do
[59:33] in this hour because we realize we
[59:36] realize that we have something very
[59:38] special. We have something very specific
[59:40] and we're not following a God that
[59:42] changes like the wind in its direction.
[59:44] But we have the ability to know exactly
[59:47] who we are following. And we have the
[59:49] ability to know exactly where he is
[59:51] taking us to. We don't have to wonder if
[59:54] he's changing. We don't have to wonder
[59:56] if he's going to change his mind. But
[59:58] this scripture right here
[1:00:00] single-handedly proves and shows us
[1:00:02] something very, very powerful that he is
[1:00:05] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:00:08] It gives us as believers the the ability
[1:00:11] and it gives us the a strong reason to
[1:00:15] stay faithful in his promises to never
[1:00:17] give up and to always keep going. And we
[1:00:20] realize that if if if it it proves that
[1:00:23] Jesus is truly divine because he could
[1:00:27] not be God if he changed but he remains
[1:00:30] to be the same. And the only way that we
[1:00:32] could say he is divine is because God
[1:00:35] alone is unchanging in his manners. So
[1:00:38] therefore we could say Jesus Christ is
[1:00:41] the same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:00:44] He is the same. He is identical. He is
[1:00:47] not different. He's not he's not
[1:00:48] changing. He is unchanging. He is
[1:00:51] unmovable. And I will say this, he is
[1:00:54] undeniably he is still Jesus Christ.
[1:00:57] Now, the prophet would use this per this
[1:01:00] this certain scripture over 3,000 times
[1:01:03] when he was ministering all over the
[1:01:05] world. He would use it in Switzerland.
[1:01:06] He would use it in Jamaica. He would use
[1:01:09] it here in the United States and in
[1:01:10] Canada. And he was not showing just here
[1:01:13] in the United States that he was the
[1:01:14] same here. But he was showing that he
[1:01:16] was the same in every dynamic in every
[1:01:19] diraphic and every every spot of the
[1:01:22] world that he's the same yesterday,
[1:01:24] today, and forever. And we realize that
[1:01:26] we are living in a world where the world
[1:01:28] is in constant disarray and and it's
[1:01:31] constantly changing and the world is
[1:01:33] constantly falling apart. We we see
[1:01:35] shifts of powers. We see people that are
[1:01:38] moving with this movement or that
[1:01:40] movement or getting in with this click
[1:01:41] or or that clack and we realize that
[1:01:44] change is always happening. And to be
[1:01:46] honest, we are constantly in a season of
[1:01:49] change in our life where life changes.
[1:01:51] Women go through a change. Men go
[1:01:54] through a change. Young people go
[1:01:56] through a change. But we realize this.
[1:01:58] There is one thing that remains to be
[1:02:00] constant. And his name is Jesus. And he
[1:02:03] doesn't plan on changing. And he never
[1:02:05] will change because he is the same. And
[1:02:07] if he is the same, then he's got to do
[1:02:09] the same thing that he did in Paul's
[1:02:11] day. He's got to do the same thing
[1:02:13] today. So I ask you, why shouldn't we
[1:02:15] believe in him?
[1:02:19] Now, Brother Manam said, "It's what is
[1:02:21] it?" He said, "It's not the mythical
[1:02:23] imaginary God sitting out there." He
[1:02:25] said, "But the living God." He said,
[1:02:28] "What is the living God? It is the word
[1:02:30] in you making itself real." He said,
[1:02:33] "Woo, glory to God." Now, I would like
[1:02:35] to ask the question, I wonder what Mary
[1:02:38] would say about that. It's not an
[1:02:40] imaginary God, but he is a living God
[1:02:42] manifesting his word right in you. If we
[1:02:45] could ask Mary, what would you say about
[1:02:47] that? I would say that she would say,
[1:02:49] "Wow, we sure should serve him because
[1:02:51] he's the kind of God that'll fill your
[1:02:54] womb with a life that'll change the rest
[1:02:57] of the world." I wonder what if we would
[1:02:59] ask Ezekiel, what would he say about
[1:03:01] that specific quote? I would say that he
[1:03:04] would say, "Yes, these dead bones can
[1:03:06] live again." I'd say if we would ask
[1:03:08] Jeremiah about this certain quote, "Is
[1:03:10] he an imaginary God? Is he a dead God?
[1:03:13] Or is he a manifested God?" He would
[1:03:15] say, "It's like fire that is shut up in
[1:03:17] my bones."
[1:03:19] Now the prophet taught us that no
[1:03:21] believer in his in in his right mind can
[1:03:24] ever place God can ever place God
[1:03:26] somewhere in the past. But that believer
[1:03:29] will bring God's word to the right
[1:03:32] present. Yes, he is a historian God.
[1:03:34] Yes, he's a God of history, but a true
[1:03:37] believer will not say that he's a God
[1:03:38] that was back here, but he's a God of
[1:03:41] right now. And I was reading this
[1:03:43] morning over in the book of Acts chapter
[1:03:45] 16 and you find there when Paul was
[1:03:47] coming and there's some very powerful
[1:03:49] things that happened in chapter 16 of
[1:03:51] verse Acts. Acts chapter 16, you begin
[1:03:53] to read that Paul is standing there and
[1:03:55] the Bible said that Paul had a vision.
[1:03:58] He had a vision about nighttime that
[1:04:00] he's standing out there and there came a
[1:04:02] man that was standing before him and
[1:04:04] said, "Come over unto Macedonia and help
[1:04:07] us." Now you go to studying that and
[1:04:10] you're trying to find who that man was.
[1:04:12] Now we realize that the God our Lord he
[1:04:14] would use men in symbology or maybe
[1:04:17] maybe it would be in pertaining to
[1:04:19] something or to someone or to something
[1:04:21] in the area just like Georgie Carter.
[1:04:24] There was one person there there was a
[1:04:26] little lamb that was caught in a thicket
[1:04:28] and she was crying for help. It's kind
[1:04:30] of like it's kind of like Daniel when he
[1:04:32] was down there in Persia. He was down
[1:04:34] there and he was crying for help. And
[1:04:36] the angel finally showed up and said, "I
[1:04:39] heard the very first time that you
[1:04:40] called. I heard the very first time that
[1:04:43] you called." And the reason why I'm here
[1:04:45] is because of thy words. If Daniel could
[1:04:48] stand there and say, "I know he's the
[1:04:50] same." Then how could we not stand here
[1:04:52] and say, "Why shouldn't we believe he's
[1:04:54] the same?"
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Now, Paul was standing there in this
[1:04:58] commission. He's he's under this vision.
[1:04:59] He doesn't know who the man is. But let
[1:05:01] me ask you this. under Paul giving
[1:05:04] giving you the vantage point from Paul's
[1:05:06] supernatural change in his life. Why
[1:05:09] would Paul change from moving into the
[1:05:11] supernatural if he's just had a
[1:05:13] supernatural change? But he is simply he
[1:05:16] simply falls under obedience. Luke
[1:05:18] follows him. Silas follows him. And they
[1:05:21] go and get on a ship and they're going
[1:05:24] over to Macedonia. And you begin to
[1:05:26] watch some supernatural elements that
[1:05:28] are coming in. You watch immediately
[1:05:30] that you're going to see the very first
[1:05:31] convert of Europe coming in when Lydia
[1:05:34] that is a traitor of purple. She begins
[1:05:36] to give her heart to the Lord. What was
[1:05:38] it? It was going to be very significant
[1:05:41] of the church that was going to be in
[1:05:42] Philippi because there was somebody that
[1:05:45] was calling for help down there in
[1:05:47] Macedonia.
[1:05:49] You immediately begin to watch as Paul
[1:05:51] obeys that vision that Paul goes over
[1:05:54] there and there's a little bitty girl or
[1:05:56] a girl that's under the spirit of
[1:05:58] divination and she's there and she's
[1:05:59] being used for wicked things and all of
[1:06:01] a sudden brother man said this. He said
[1:06:04] now he said Paul could have turned
[1:06:05] around and rebuked her from the very
[1:06:06] first time. He said but he waited until
[1:06:08] God said so. So he come over there not
[1:06:12] only to help Lydia. He come over to help
[1:06:14] that little slave girl that was trapped
[1:06:16] in divination and then he come over
[1:06:18] there and all of a sudden he got to
[1:06:20] worshiping and he got to preaching Jesus
[1:06:22] Christ as the same yesterday and forever
[1:06:24] and they threw him in a common prison.
[1:06:26] Something very powerful happens when you
[1:06:28] trap in this gospel. When you try to
[1:06:30] shut the message up into a box, there's
[1:06:32] something very powerful that happens
[1:06:34] when you try to say that he's a God that
[1:06:36] that doesn't do those things no more and
[1:06:38] and he doesn't heal no more and doesn't
[1:06:39] give the Holy Ghost no more. is
[1:06:41] something powerful. When you say God
[1:06:43] can't, then God shows up and shows that
[1:06:45] he can.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; And here Paul and Silas are trapped up.
[1:06:51] They've been in prison for preaching
[1:06:52] this message and believing this message.
[1:06:55] But all of a sudden, there's became to
[1:06:57] be a spirit of worship that got on Silas
[1:07:00] and then it got on Paul. And all of a
[1:07:02] sudden, there be to be an earthquake
[1:07:04] because of their praise. And it shook
[1:07:07] open the prison doors. Let me ask you
[1:07:10] this. If Paul and Silas could praise in
[1:07:13] such a way, then why shouldn't we?
[1:07:22] I tell you something powerful happened.
[1:07:24] That Philippian jailer was standing
[1:07:26] there and he sees all of this happening
[1:07:28] and he's getting ready to kill himself.
[1:07:30] And Paul said, "You ain't got a need to
[1:07:32] do that." But Paul leads him out,
[1:07:34] baptizes him in the name of Jesus
[1:07:36] Christ. And you begin to see the setup
[1:07:39] of the original, hallelujah, of the
[1:07:41] church right there in Philippi.
[1:07:45] Now, you notice what the scripture said.
[1:07:46] I love this. To me, this is brother
[1:07:49] Ron's scripture. Isaiah 43 and2. When
[1:07:53] thou passest through the waters, I will
[1:07:55] be with thee. And through the rivers,
[1:07:57] they shall not overflow thee. When thou
[1:07:59] walst through the fire, they you thou
[1:08:02] shalt not be burned. Neither shall the
[1:08:04] flame kindle upon thee. God is saying
[1:08:08] there's nowhere that you can get
[1:08:09] yourself into that I'm not already
[1:08:12] there. When you're going through the
[1:08:14] trouble, I'm going to be there. When
[1:08:16] you're in the valley, I'm going to be
[1:08:17] there. When you're walking through the
[1:08:19] fire, I'm going to be there. You see,
[1:08:22] there was a man one time that said, you
[1:08:24] know, he said, "I I believe in healing
[1:08:26] if I get desperate enough about it."
[1:08:30] You to me, that's kind of like having a
[1:08:32] fire extinguisher back there on the wall
[1:08:34] and knowing and knowing what its
[1:08:36] abilities are and knowing what it's
[1:08:38] capable of, but never reading the
[1:08:41] instructions on how to use it, but
[1:08:44] waiting till you get into a fire to
[1:08:46] start reading me to start reading the
[1:08:48] instructions on how to use that fire
[1:08:50] extinguisher. Let me say this to you.
[1:08:52] You don't wait to read the instructions
[1:08:55] on the fire extinguisher until your
[1:08:57] house is burning on fire. And you do not
[1:09:00] wait to learn how to fight this battle
[1:09:02] of faith until until you get in the
[1:09:04] flames of it. You don't stud you don't
[1:09:07] study healing in the fire, but you
[1:09:09] believe on the healer before the he
[1:09:12] before the flames ever show up. Jesus
[1:09:15] never stepped into the fire with a four
[1:09:18] with to be the fourth man when they
[1:09:20] cooled the fire down. He stepped into
[1:09:22] the fire when they heated it up seven
[1:09:24] times.
[1:09:26] Jesus showed up in this hour in this
[1:09:29] laying seven church age when things are
[1:09:32] as hot.
[1:09:35] So don't wait to read the instructions.
[1:09:38] Go. Hallelujah. And if anybody comes out
[1:09:41] with a fire extinguisher to put out this
[1:09:44] Holy Ghost fire, Brother Denny, I
[1:09:46] authorize you by the Holy Ghost to take
[1:09:49] that fire extinguisher. I believe that's
[1:09:51] the reason
[1:09:55] we got too many people trying to shut
[1:09:57] the fire of the Holy Ghost down in the
[1:10:00] message. There too many fire
[1:10:02] extinguishers.
[1:10:06] But let me ask you something. Why
[1:10:08] shouldn't we believe he's the same
[1:10:09] yesterday, today, and forever? Why
[1:10:12] shouldn't we believe he's more than
[1:10:13] capable to do exceedingly abundantly
[1:10:15] above all that we could ever ask or
[1:10:17] think?
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we?
[1:10:24] Matthew 4 and23 said
[1:10:28] and Jesus
[1:10:31] went about all of Galilee teaching in
[1:10:34] their synagogues and preaching the
[1:10:36] gospel of the kingdom
[1:10:38] and healing all manner of sickness and
[1:10:40] all manner of diseases amongst the
[1:10:42] people. And his fame went throughout all
[1:10:44] of Syria. And they brought unto him
[1:10:48] all sick people that were taken with
[1:10:52] diverse diseases and torments, and those
[1:10:55] which were possessed with devils, and
[1:10:58] those which are a lunatic, and those
[1:11:00] that had the Pauly,
[1:11:04] and he
[1:11:06] healed them.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Now, you can line up every single devil
[1:11:10] right here. You can line up every
[1:11:12] tuberculosis, every cancer. You can line
[1:11:15] up every every lying devil.
[1:11:19] Every devil that says a message is
[1:11:21] wrong. You can line it up right here.
[1:11:23] You can line up every suicide devil.
[1:11:26] Line it up right here. You can line up
[1:11:28] your tuberculosis. You can line up your
[1:11:30] anxiety. You can line up your anxiety
[1:11:33] and your depression and all of your
[1:11:34] problems. And there ain't a problem too
[1:11:37] big.
[1:11:39] Now, if he did it then, can he do it
[1:11:43] now? So why shouldn't we believe?
[1:11:48] Brother Random said, "Now if Jesus
[1:11:50] Christ," and God forgive me for saying
[1:11:53] if, he said, "I don't mean to be
[1:11:55] sacriiggious, but to make a point." He
[1:11:57] said, "If Jesus is the same yesterday,
[1:11:59] today, and forever, and we have the same
[1:12:02] desire, then why can't we see him if
[1:12:05] he's still the same?" Now, he's got to
[1:12:07] be the same in the Bible. If the Bible
[1:12:09] says he's the same, he's the same
[1:12:11] savior, the same healer, and just the
[1:12:14] same as he was. The only thing different
[1:12:16] in him, he's now in an invisible body.
[1:12:19] And there where he was in a visible
[1:12:22] body, but he has promised that a little
[1:12:24] while and the world won't see me no
[1:12:25] more. Yet you shall see me. For I and I
[1:12:29] is a personal pronoun. I will be with
[1:12:33] you even in you to the end of the
[1:12:36] consummation or the end of the age. Now
[1:12:38] you know that the scripture says that I
[1:12:40] am God and I change not. So if Jesus of
[1:12:45] the Bible healed then Jesus of the
[1:12:47] Bible,
[1:12:49] if Jesus of the Bible delivered then,
[1:12:53] then he delivers now. If he saved then
[1:12:56] he if he filled him with the Holy Ghost,
[1:12:59] then he
[1:13:02] So why shouldn't we believe all that
[1:13:06] he's promised unto us?
[1:13:09] Now Paul said in Romans 8:31,
[1:13:13] "What shall we then say?"
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Then there comes a time when there is a
[1:13:20] then what shall we then say to these
[1:13:24] things? Now what is that then? What is
[1:13:28] what is Paul referring to? What is he
[1:13:30] speaking? Let's go back to that then.
[1:13:33] Let's go back to verse 28. And we know
[1:13:35] that all things work together for the
[1:13:38] good to them that love God, to them who
[1:13:40] are the called according to his purpose.
[1:13:44] What shall we then say that if he loved
[1:13:47] me
[1:13:49] when I didn't look lovable?
[1:13:52] When he saved me when I didn't look
[1:13:53] savable,
[1:13:55] what shall we then say? For whom he did
[1:13:58] for know, he also did predestinate to be
[1:14:01] conformed to the image of his son, that
[1:14:04] he might be the firstborn amongst many
[1:14:06] brethren. Moreover, whom he did
[1:14:08] predestinate, them he also called, and
[1:14:11] whom he called, them he also justified.
[1:14:14] And whom he justified, them he also
[1:14:16] glorified.
[1:14:18] Now what shall we then say to these
[1:14:20] things? If he elected me when you didn't
[1:14:24] elect me, when he called me when you
[1:14:27] didn't call me, when he filled me when
[1:14:29] you didn't think I was fillable, what
[1:14:31] shall we then say to these things?
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Though Trump's on my side, though
[1:14:38] Biden's on my side, though Putin's on my
[1:14:40] side, if nobody's on my side, what shall
[1:14:43] we then say to these things? If God be
[1:14:46] for us,
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; can anybody tell me that God ain't for
[1:14:51] him?
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Somebody stand up and say, "If he isn't
[1:14:56] for you, so and prove me by the Bible
[1:14:59] that God is not for you." I will take
[1:15:02] anybody, no matter how wretched that you
[1:15:05] are,
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; show me God isn't for you.
[1:15:14] So if go
[1:15:16] is for you,
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; go back to Matthew 4:24.
[1:15:23] If God be for us, if God be for us, then
[1:15:28] who can be against us? There ain't no
[1:15:31] devil in hell that can be against you.
[1:15:34] If God is for you, there ain't no
[1:15:36] disease that can stop you if God is for
[1:15:39] you. There's no cancer cells that can
[1:15:41] defeat God's purpose in your life if God
[1:15:44] is for you. So, let me ask you
[1:15:46] something. Why shouldn't we believe?
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Let me let me let me change your focus.
[1:15:57] Let me just change it down.
[1:16:00] Because God is for us,
[1:16:04] then our victory is certain.
[1:16:08] Let me let me let me change your focus
[1:16:11] even more. We don't fight for victory.
[1:16:15] We're fighting from victory.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; I said we're fighting from victory.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor said, "I'm not
[1:16:22] fighting for victory. I'm fighting from
[1:16:25] from." That is a place. That is a place
[1:16:30] where where are you fighting from,
[1:16:32] brother Andrew? I am fighting from
[1:16:34] Calvary. I am frightened from the day of
[1:16:36] Pentecost. I am fighting.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:42] I I tell you what, I feel like a
[1:16:44] preacher now. I done got the nerves at
[1:16:46] the way.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; So, what I'm saying to you, let me
[1:16:50] change your focus. I'm not fighting for
[1:16:52] my brother Ron's victory. I'm fighting
[1:16:55] from Jesus Christ victory so that
[1:16:58] brother Ron can have victory.
[1:17:01] I'm not fighting for Sister Wanda's
[1:17:03] Holes healing. I'm fighting to prove
[1:17:07] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:17:09] forever.
[1:17:11] If he healed Sister Hattie Waldorf when
[1:17:14] she had cancer in her heart, then why
[1:17:17] shouldn't we believe for Sister Wanda?
[1:17:24] Hallelujah.
[1:17:26] If he got a hold of George Carter, then
[1:17:29] why should we not believe?
[1:17:33] Tell me why.
[1:17:35] Tell me. I'll take any devil in charge.
[1:17:39] Tell me why we can't have it.
[1:17:46] [Applause]
[1:17:48] He's the seal, the Almighty. He's the
[1:17:52] God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the
[1:17:54] God of Jacob. And we are Abraham's seed.
[1:17:56] Being dead in Christ, we take on
[1:17:58] Abraham's seed and are heirs according
[1:18:00] to the promise. Why shouldn't we believe
[1:18:03] in the supernatural? Amen. Notice, don't
[1:18:05] you get scared. Amen. Means so be it.
[1:18:07] You see, everything that's everlasting.
[1:18:10] Everything that's real is
[1:18:12] unscientifically proved. The whole armor
[1:18:14] of God is completely supernatural. Love,
[1:18:16] joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness,
[1:18:18] meekness, gentleness, patience, faith,
[1:18:20] every the whole armor of the
[1:18:21] Christianity is supernatural.
[1:18:24] Then why shouldn't we believe in
[1:18:28] supernatural things?
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you, let me
[1:18:36] why shouldn't we?
[1:18:38] If the Bible said in Ma or Mark 9 and
[1:18:40] 23, if thou can't believe, all things
[1:18:43] are possible to them that believeth. In
[1:18:46] Genesis 18:14, is anything too hard for
[1:18:49] the Lord? in Matthew 17 and 20. Because
[1:18:52] of your unbelief, verily I say unto you,
[1:18:55] if you have faith as grain of a mustard
[1:18:57] seed,
[1:18:59] you shall say unto this mountain,
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; why shouldn't we?
[1:19:07] Say unto this mountain, now you know
[1:19:10] what your mountain is. I'm going to ask
[1:19:12] you a question. Why shouldn't we?
[1:19:15] How many's got a mountain in your way?
[1:19:19] But how many's got a promise?
[1:19:22] Which one's bigger?
[1:19:24] Brother Brandham said, "Let me ask you
[1:19:26] the question. Which one was first, a
[1:19:28] savior or a sinner?" He said, "A savior
[1:19:31] was." He said, "Therefore, the savior is
[1:19:34] greater than the sinner. Why shouldn't
[1:19:37] we speak to the mountain? Why shouldn't
[1:19:39] we speak to dead wounds? Why shouldn't
[1:19:41] we believe for the impossible?
[1:19:47] Why shouldn't we believe? When the Bible
[1:19:51] said, "Ask and you shall receive." He
[1:19:54] said, "Ask, knock, and it shall be
[1:19:56] opened unto you." My beautiful little
[1:19:59] girl down here sang with me tonight.
[1:20:02] She's turning 14 on Monday.
[1:20:05] And today we had a little birthday party
[1:20:07] for her there. But could you imagine if
[1:20:10] we had the party, we had all the cake. I
[1:20:12] can tell you what, if she'd have left
[1:20:13] the cake, it' have been taken care of.
[1:20:17] But could you imagine as as grandparents
[1:20:19] are gathered and great-grandparents are
[1:20:21] gathered and parents and uncles and
[1:20:22] aunts are all gathered there and they've
[1:20:24] got these beautiful gifts there that are
[1:20:26] sitting out there before and all of a
[1:20:28] sudden Reagan walks in and said, "I
[1:20:30] believe I'm just leave them setting
[1:20:31] right there. I don't believe I don't
[1:20:34] believe it. I really don't believe that
[1:20:36] that's my birthday. I don't believe
[1:20:37] that's my birthday. It's got my name on
[1:20:39] it, but I really don't believe it. It's
[1:20:41] got my name on it.
[1:20:42] It looks exactly what I asked for, but I
[1:20:44] really don't believe it. You know,
[1:20:45] that's the same way that people do. They
[1:20:47] ask God over and over and over and over
[1:20:49] again for a certain thing from the Lord.
[1:20:52] And all of a sudden, God's got the
[1:20:53] package right out there for you. And all
[1:20:55] you got to do is
[1:20:57] I'll tell you what, when it comes to
[1:20:59] opening gifts, you won't have to worry.
[1:21:01] There will be little kids there. There
[1:21:03] will be little kids over here that say,
[1:21:05] "Can I help you with it?" But this is a
[1:21:07] time where you can get stubborn in the
[1:21:09] house of God. It's got my name on it.
[1:21:13] You can go back down there and set until
[1:21:15] you get yours, but this is mine. I have
[1:21:18] asked for my deliverance and it's got my
[1:21:20] name on it. I have asked for my healing
[1:21:22] and it's got my name on it. You have a
[1:21:24] right to be selfish with the word of God
[1:21:26] if it's got your name on it. What did
[1:21:28] John weep about? He saw his name there
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; and he knew if somebody didn't step up,
[1:21:36] John was weeping for himself.
[1:21:40] But he didn't have to weep long. I say
[1:21:43] this, weeping may endure for a moment,
[1:21:45] but joy is coming in the morning. Why
[1:21:48] shouldn't we believe it?
[1:21:57] Let me ask you this. Why shouldn't we
[1:22:00] give unto the Lord?
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; For Luke 6 and38 says, "Give and it
[1:22:06] shall be given unto you. good measure
[1:22:08] pressed down, shaken together, running
[1:22:10] over, shall men give unto your bosom.
[1:22:12] For with the same measure that you meet,
[1:22:14] with all shall it be measured to you
[1:22:16] again. Jesus said, "It is more blessed
[1:22:18] to give
[1:22:21] than it is
[1:22:23] to receive."
[1:22:26] You imagine as Jesus is I want you to I
[1:22:29] want to paint this picture. Heaven
[1:22:32] sitting down in a corner.
[1:22:35] We could look at we could look at it and
[1:22:37] we could see why Jesus is sitting down.
[1:22:40] But he's sitting down at a treasury and
[1:22:42] everybody has got their eyes on Jesus.
[1:22:45] And there's something about Jesus. It
[1:22:48] either brings out the worst of people or
[1:22:50] it brings out the know-it-alls.
[1:22:54] And here comes all the know-it-alls. And
[1:22:56] here comes the rich and the famous. And
[1:22:58] they start bringing all of their money
[1:23:00] that they got from their granddaddy's
[1:23:02] inheritance and they got from their from
[1:23:03] their great job. and how they sold their
[1:23:05] soul and sold out their birth rights and
[1:23:07] they and they they had been out there
[1:23:09] and they got rich on these things and
[1:23:11] Jesus is just sitting down in the
[1:23:12] corner. I think it's amazing when heaven
[1:23:14] sits down on you. But when heaven stands
[1:23:17] up,
[1:23:19] but when heaven stands up, it means
[1:23:21] something special. Jesus had watched all
[1:23:23] the rich and the famous come and dropped
[1:23:25] everything that they had. They dropped
[1:23:27] it down into the treasury and Jesus
[1:23:29] never moved and he never said one thing
[1:23:31] about it. But when this little woman
[1:23:33] gave all that she had, heaven stood up.
[1:23:38] I know this that she gave her all
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; and she got heaven's attention.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; So why shouldn't we?
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; If it'll make heaven get up out of the
[1:23:51] corner, I say she gave her all, then why
[1:23:54] shouldn't we move heaven tonight?
[1:23:57] Come on, somebody. I said, why shouldn't
[1:23:59] we? Why shouldn't we give our all?
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; What are you saying, brother Angel? I'm
[1:24:10] saying she didn't need some choir to
[1:24:12] back her up. She didn't need a full
[1:24:14] wallet to back her up. She didn't even
[1:24:16] need a good mood to praise God in. She
[1:24:19] simply gave it all.
[1:24:21] Well, Brother Andrew, I'd really sing if
[1:24:23] I had a choir to back me up. I'd really
[1:24:25] sing if the if the musicians knew what
[1:24:27] key I was singing in. We'd we'd play
[1:24:30] along with you if you knew what key you
[1:24:31] was singing in.
[1:24:34] You know what? I've had everything in
[1:24:36] the world go wrong with me this week.
[1:24:37] You have no idea. My air condition went
[1:24:39] out. My back went out. I fell. I almost
[1:24:41] broke my hip. I broke my back. I tell
[1:24:43] you what, I'm hurting all over the
[1:24:44] place. I tell you what, I I really just
[1:24:46] don't feel like
[1:24:48] I really I just I've been so tired. I've
[1:24:50] been so worn out. And I I I just I don't
[1:24:53] feel like I I just don't feel like I got
[1:24:55] the energy.
[1:24:58] Come on. Why shouldn't we? Come on.
[1:25:03] Why shouldn't we?
[1:25:09] She took every excuse out of the picture
[1:25:13] when she gave everything she's got. I'd
[1:25:15] say brother Ron has threw every excuse
[1:25:18] away.
[1:25:20] So why shouldn't we?
[1:25:26] [Applause]
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we confess that Jesus is
[1:25:39] Lord?
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Just because we have a bunch of
[1:25:43] hypocrites in the world today that want
[1:25:45] to act like Christians, but they really
[1:25:47] ain't. They are happy serving God as
[1:25:50] long as God doesn't make them go by some
[1:25:52] rule that he wrote down.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; But why shouldn't we confess that he's
[1:25:58] Lord, he's savior, he's healer, he's a
[1:25:59] manifesting almighty God, the same
[1:26:02] yesterday, today, and forever. He is
[1:26:03] alpha and omega. He is the beginning and
[1:26:06] the end. He is the root of David, and he
[1:26:08] is David's offspring. Tell me, why
[1:26:10] shouldn't we worship and confess that
[1:26:13] he's more than able to do exceedingly
[1:26:15] abundantly above all that I could ever
[1:26:16] Let me ask. Why shouldn't I tell
[1:26:19] somebody how he saved me out of a
[1:26:21] devil's pit? How he came and picked me
[1:26:23] up when I was so low and I thought
[1:26:25] nobody cared about. Why shouldn't we get
[1:26:27] up and tell somebody how the God of this
[1:26:30] message that is God, he is rich in
[1:26:32] mercy, why shouldn't we testify
[1:26:40] when the Bible said in 1 John 4:15 that
[1:26:43] whosoever shall confess that Jesus is
[1:26:46] the son of God, God dwelleth in him and
[1:26:50] he in God.
[1:26:56] That's right.
[1:26:58] It also says in Hebrews 4:14, "Seeing
[1:27:02] then that we have a great high priest
[1:27:03] that has passed from heavens, Jesus the
[1:27:06] son of God, let us hold fast our
[1:27:10] profession.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell something and it's
[1:27:14] very painful for me to tell about it,
[1:27:16] but it was something I witnessed as a
[1:27:18] little bitty child." And I won't tell
[1:27:19] where it happened and I won't tell try
[1:27:21] not to do get too specific because I
[1:27:23] know that there's some believers that
[1:27:25] know this story and I wouldn't dare mean
[1:27:29] to offend nobody but there's power in
[1:27:31] holding on to your confession. There was
[1:27:33] a there was a great man I went to a
[1:27:35] convention as a little bitty child. That
[1:27:37] was one thing that I I found amazing
[1:27:39] about our our pastor, brother Ron. He
[1:27:41] wanted to make sure that we stayed in
[1:27:42] the right kind of an atmosphere. He he
[1:27:44] didn't try to hold us back and keep us
[1:27:45] all sheltered in that he was the only
[1:27:47] man. But he sent us out there because he
[1:27:49] knew that God had some dressear, some
[1:27:51] five five-fold ministry and and that the
[1:27:53] body needs it. And so we went to this
[1:27:56] meeting. It was a very large meeting.
[1:27:58] And the man of God was up there
[1:27:59] preaching. And I tell you, it was even
[1:28:00] as a little child and I wasn't saved and
[1:28:02] I didn't have the Holy Ghost, but I knew
[1:28:04] there was something special that was
[1:28:05] happening. And I I stood real close and
[1:28:07] I I watched this woman and and she was
[1:28:09] down in a wheelchair. And all of a
[1:28:11] sudden, the man of God went down there
[1:28:12] and prayed for her and she got up out of
[1:28:14] that wheelchair and she ran all over
[1:28:16] that building. And I remembered as a
[1:28:18] little bitty child that it electrified
[1:28:21] that entire building. It it, as you can
[1:28:24] imagine, I was a little bit child and I
[1:28:26] was watching those things. Can you
[1:28:27] imagine to what it did for the people
[1:28:28] that was sitting in wheelchairs,
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; what it did for them to see that woman
[1:28:32] that was bound to that wheelchair all of
[1:28:33] a sudden stand up and start running all
[1:28:35] over that building. When the anointing
[1:28:37] weed off of her, she went back and sat
[1:28:39] back down in that wheelchair. and she
[1:28:40] never got out of it again.
[1:28:43] It shows us that there is power in
[1:28:47] holding on to your confession. You see,
[1:28:49] it isn't just powerful if you can say it
[1:28:52] in church. It's powerful when it lines
[1:28:54] up with your life, with your testimony
[1:28:57] on your job, when you're talking to your
[1:28:59] secretary, when you're talking
[1:29:01] Hallelujah.
[1:29:03] When you're talking to your wife and
[1:29:05] things are all hot and bothered in the
[1:29:07] house and you lose your temper like
[1:29:09] Zapora and Moses did one day,
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; I wonder if you still hold your
[1:29:15] confession
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; in the heat of the moment
[1:29:20] when Satan is tempting you and trying to
[1:29:22] torment your mind.
[1:29:24] I say, why shouldn't we hold our
[1:29:26] confession?
[1:29:30] Why shouldn't we believe in healing when
[1:29:32] the Bible said in Isaiah 53 and:4,
[1:29:34] "Surely he had borne our griefs and
[1:29:37] carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem
[1:29:39] him stricken, smitten of God, and
[1:29:40] afflicted, but he was wounded for our
[1:29:42] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[1:29:44] iniquities. The chastisement of our
[1:29:46] peace was upon him, and with his stripes
[1:29:50] we are healed."
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Now, it's one thing when you don't
[1:29:54] realize who that scripture is pertaining
[1:29:57] to. I have watched and witnessed where
[1:30:00] people go up, Christian believers go up
[1:30:02] to Jews and they ask them, "Now, what is
[1:30:05] that scripture pertaining to?" And they
[1:30:07] say, "Well, we don't really believe it,
[1:30:10] but we believe that you think that it is
[1:30:13] testifying of Yeshua.
[1:30:16] It does not have no effect on them
[1:30:18] because they do not believe that he
[1:30:19] fulfilled it,
[1:30:22] but he did."
[1:30:25] What makes a difference is that you
[1:30:27] believe it.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm I'm know good and well that
[1:30:34] I've got some young girls here.
[1:30:37] So, I'm I know good and well when I ask
[1:30:38] this question, I got an answer to it
[1:30:40] already. How many walked in before you
[1:30:43] come to church and looked in the mirror?
[1:30:45] And I can tell some of you didn't, but
[1:30:51] but how many of you really walked in
[1:30:53] before before you come to church? Now,
[1:30:57] literally when you walked in there, what
[1:31:00] was you going in there for? To see if
[1:31:02] your neck tie was like brother Andrews.
[1:31:06] Literally, why did you go you because to
[1:31:09] be honest, you wanted to see if you look
[1:31:10] good.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; You want to make sure because you want
[1:31:12] to make yourself presentable before you
[1:31:14] go to the house of the Lord.
[1:31:15] I don't believe you ought to wear a
[1:31:16] suit, but I believe you ought to dress
[1:31:18] pretty nice when it comes to the house
[1:31:19] of the Lord. Brother Ron didn't give a
[1:31:20] speech last week, and I'm going to give
[1:31:22] it to you right now.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Why'd you go in there? Because you
[1:31:25] wanted to make sure that you was looking
[1:31:27] good. Now, let me ask you this question.
[1:31:29] How many had the mirror talk back to
[1:31:31] them?
[1:31:33] Mirror, mirror on the wall. Am I still
[1:31:35] the fairest of them all?
[1:31:38] Take me back to days when I knew that I
[1:31:41] was just as good as then when I was
[1:31:44] looking like I was. Let me let me ask
[1:31:47] you something. I mean, when you looked
[1:31:49] in it, did it talk back to you? Say, you
[1:31:51] know what? You a fine specimen of a
[1:31:53] human. Your wife is so blessed to have
[1:31:56] you. My goodness.
[1:32:01] If you got that kind of mirror, I need
[1:32:03] to have it.
[1:32:07] Guarantee you this that none of these
[1:32:10] teenage girls had the ability to have
[1:32:12] their mirror talk back to them. But they
[1:32:15] walked in there.
[1:32:17] Yep. If he sees me on the internet
[1:32:20] tonight,
[1:32:22] I'm going to get his attention.
[1:32:26] I just hope he's tuning in tonight.
[1:32:28] Maybe brother Andrew say something
[1:32:29] special about him. He'll get to looking
[1:32:31] and
[1:32:38] I don't get paid much to do this, but
[1:32:39] I'm getting paid to do this. This is
[1:32:41] amazing.
[1:32:43] Hallelujah.
[1:32:45] I guarantee it didn't talk back to you.
[1:32:47] But some of you left there thinking, you
[1:32:49] know what?
[1:32:51] I believe I'm I'm dressed right. I look
[1:32:54] good. I feel like I'm decent. I ain't
[1:32:56] got no humps or bumps showing.
[1:32:59] I ain't got no I don't need no parachute
[1:33:01] to get out of my high heels. My hair is
[1:33:03] just right. Guarantee the mirror didn't
[1:33:06] tell you that. But something on the
[1:33:08] inside of you made you believe. It made
[1:33:11] you believe that you were dressed just
[1:33:12] right. You were believing that you were
[1:33:15] dressing according to the message of the
[1:33:16] hour. The mirror didn't tell you that.
[1:33:20] But what you believed about this
[1:33:21] message, you looked in that mirror
[1:33:24] and you looked in that mirror and you
[1:33:26] look back at this word and all of a
[1:33:28] sudden you said, "You know what? I think
[1:33:30] I'm matching up.
[1:33:33] Then why shouldn't we look in the mirror
[1:33:35] of this word and take it now? Al
[1:33:39] Hallelujah.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That mirror can never talk
[1:33:45] to me and tell me I look good. But this
[1:33:48] mirror, this mirror has the ability to
[1:33:52] tell me that I'm dressing right, that
[1:33:54] I'm walking right, that I'm living
[1:33:56] right.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:06] I got to get out there. That That's
[1:34:08] heavy.
[1:34:10] I don't ever want to get in the mind of
[1:34:11] a teenager ever again. That was scary.
[1:34:16] But why shouldn't we believe in healing?
[1:34:19] The scripture said in Jeremiah when he
[1:34:21] was speaking to him, "Is there no bomb
[1:34:23] in Gilead? Is there no physician down
[1:34:26] there? Then why do my people go
[1:34:28] searching around where they knew they
[1:34:30] couldn't answer and say there wasn't a
[1:34:32] physician down there because they knew
[1:34:33] there was a physician there. They
[1:34:35] couldn't say there was no God and no
[1:34:36] there was no B because they knew it was
[1:34:38] down there. Then why do we spend our
[1:34:41] time looking on Instagram and YouTube
[1:34:43] for something to motivate our souls when
[1:34:46] we've got everything we have need of?
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:56] Thou art the God, Psalm 77:14,
[1:35:01] that doest wonders. Thou hast declared
[1:35:04] thy strength amongst the people.
[1:35:08] The man that was sitting by the pool
[1:35:09] said, he's a God that does wonderful
[1:35:12] things. the leper that came on to
[1:35:14] worship him.
[1:35:16] And immediately he told him, he said,
[1:35:19] "If you can just say it,
[1:35:24] I don't need you to touch me.
[1:35:27] I just need the mirror of the word to
[1:35:29] say it over me.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; I don't need to have some anointed
[1:35:34] preacher do it. I don't I don't have to
[1:35:35] have I don't have to have a thousand
[1:35:37] people around me to do it. But if you
[1:35:39] can just say it,
[1:35:42] I
[1:35:44] will believe it. Now when Jesus comes in
[1:35:47] John chapter n chapter nine and you know
[1:35:50] the scripture and I I don't want to take
[1:35:51] you through the whole thing but I just
[1:35:52] want to point out a few things. When
[1:35:54] Jesus is walking with the disciples and
[1:35:56] there's and they begin to ask him said
[1:35:58] now this blind man is sitting here did
[1:36:00] he sin his mother or father sin? He said
[1:36:02] no. He said he this is done that the
[1:36:04] works of the Lord could be manifest in
[1:36:07] his life. I want to ask you where is the
[1:36:09] living God at right now. He he had you
[1:36:12] are going through struggles but he is
[1:36:14] wanting to express himself through the
[1:36:17] word. He wants to show that he is
[1:36:20] omnipotent. Let me say this. It's always
[1:36:23] it's always amazed me. John chapter 9 is
[1:36:25] one of my favorite scriptures chapters
[1:36:28] honestly because it it's always amazing
[1:36:30] to me that them Sadducees and Pharisees
[1:36:33] did not have anything in the scriptures
[1:36:35] about this
[1:36:38] because if they did they'd have done the
[1:36:40] same thing he did brother Doug they'd
[1:36:41] have start spitting on the ground
[1:36:42] preaching a little sermon all of a
[1:36:44] sudden making clay out of it but all of
[1:36:45] a sudden he he spits on the ground makes
[1:36:47] some clay out of it and rubs it in his
[1:36:49] eyes and the Pharisees said where's he
[1:36:50] getting this at I ain't found that in
[1:36:52] the book of Moses or the book of
[1:36:53] Leviticus I ain't found that anywhere.
[1:36:55] The reason why he could do that, he was
[1:36:57] a word. He was the one that was writing
[1:36:58] it over his life. And you know, they
[1:37:01] didn't even get marveled at the fact
[1:37:03] that that he that he spit on the ground.
[1:37:06] They didn't marvel at the fact that he
[1:37:08] made clay and told him to go wash and to
[1:37:10] pull us along. But what they marveled at
[1:37:13] is that Jesus or or the blind man
[1:37:15] believed what Jesus said about him.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Now, he didn't have any scriptures go
[1:37:21] off.
[1:37:23] And you may not have a a certain quote
[1:37:25] and you may not have a certain scripture
[1:37:27] to deal with the situations of your
[1:37:29] life, but neither did he. So why
[1:37:31] shouldn't we believe?
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Now notice what the scripture said here.
[1:37:38] Uh let me just skip over that. But I I
[1:37:39] want you I want to draw your attention
[1:37:41] to this quote. Brother Brandham saying
[1:37:43] it's a little bit lengthy, but stay with
[1:37:44] me. Please please stay with me. Keep
[1:37:46] your attention. Now remember, we're
[1:37:48] dealing with blind spirits. When they
[1:37:50] come out of one, they try to go to
[1:37:51] another. Just so you know that you might
[1:37:55] know, keep your head bowed until you're
[1:37:57] asked to look up. For it might be a few
[1:37:59] days from now you might not have sight.
[1:38:02] Wait till you hear me say raise your
[1:38:03] head. Cuz when you look the eyes is the
[1:38:06] gate to the soul. You say, "Well,
[1:38:08] brother Brandon, that's psychology." If
[1:38:10] it is, then Jesus used it. He took a
[1:38:12] blind man and led him away from the
[1:38:14] crowd and took him outside of the city
[1:38:16] and prayed for him. Get away. Get away
[1:38:18] from the crowd. He said, "Now pray."
[1:38:20] When he went to raise Jarius's daughter,
[1:38:23] he put everybody out of the house. He's
[1:38:25] still Jesus tonight. Whether the woman
[1:38:27] will be able to see, I don't know. She's
[1:38:29] standing here totally blind in darkness.
[1:38:32] Now have faith in God and believe while
[1:38:34] I pray for her. Please. Now, sister, now
[1:38:37] keep your head bowed and let the ledge
[1:38:39] of your eyes, blind eyes, be closed
[1:38:41] while I ask our Lord Jesus, believe that
[1:38:44] he's going to break forth and shrink up
[1:38:46] those demons in here. Then that you'll
[1:38:49] be able to see. Oh, father dear. As I
[1:38:52] stand by this blind woman, one sat along
[1:38:54] the highway begging. Then Jesus came.
[1:38:57] Oh, come near Lord. There might have
[1:38:59] been many there that had faith. I don't
[1:39:02] know if it wasn't I wasn't there, Lord,
[1:39:05] but I know that you met and give Barmus
[1:39:08] his sight. When he when he seen, he
[1:39:10] could see. I believe that he tried to
[1:39:12] follow you. This poor little mother
[1:39:15] standing here. She's blind. Lord, you
[1:39:17] know her. I'm just a man. I've tried to
[1:39:20] represent you and push back the
[1:39:22] blackness for her. Will you Lord break
[1:39:25] forth sight in these blinded eyes? Why
[1:39:27] don't we don't ask for miracles, Lord,
[1:39:30] but just something to encourage her that
[1:39:33] would make her know that you're the son
[1:39:35] of God and I be your servant, Lord, to
[1:39:37] tell them the truth. I believe if you do
[1:39:40] it, Lord, everyone in here would accept
[1:39:42] you right then. Please do it, Lord. Now
[1:39:45] will you hear my prayer as I ask you
[1:39:48] with all of my heart in Jesus name. Now
[1:39:50] notice now Satan this duel of faith you
[1:39:54] claim her and I claim her to Jesus. I
[1:39:58] claim that you have no power over her. I
[1:40:00] claim you have no power over nothing.
[1:40:02] Jesus Christ my Lord stripped and robbed
[1:40:05] you of everything that you had and every
[1:40:08] legal right at Calvary. I stand here as
[1:40:10] a representative and you know he's on
[1:40:13] the platform. Can you imagine how Satan
[1:40:16] is starting to get real nervous? And you
[1:40:18] know he's on the platform. Now that same
[1:40:22] devil's here tonight and Satan, let me
[1:40:25] call you out. And you know he's on the
[1:40:28] platform. You know all about this gift.
[1:40:31] You know about where he ministered and
[1:40:33] how he did it. And I charge thee by the
[1:40:36] living God that you come out of that
[1:40:38] woman. Leave her in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:40:41] Every head bowed. Let me see your eyes
[1:40:43] first. I will call if something happens.
[1:40:46] Now just raise your head. Can you see
[1:40:48] me? Put your hands on my nose.
[1:40:53] Amen.
[1:40:55] Open your eyes. The woman can see.
[1:41:03] Now I'm not William Brandon
[1:41:06] and I never have pretended to be him.
[1:41:10] There is only one, but he's still Jesus.
[1:41:16] And some of you are trying to find your
[1:41:18] way back home. Some of you have got cold
[1:41:20] on God. And some of you have lost your
[1:41:24] sight to get back to him.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; The coldness of Leoa has slipped in over
[1:41:33] your eyes. And God is wanting to take
[1:41:35] the oil of the Holy Ghost and anoint
[1:41:38] thine eyes with Isa so that you can see
[1:41:40] to make your way back home. Some of you
[1:41:45] hallelujah.
[1:41:48] You have forgot your first love.
[1:41:52] But may you just close your eyes for a
[1:41:54] minute
[1:41:57] and you can hear the word of the Lord
[1:41:59] speaking out to you.
[1:42:02] Now, you can't see in one moment, but
[1:42:04] all of a sudden, the anointed word comes
[1:42:06] over your life
[1:42:08] and you look up and you can see his face
[1:42:10] there before you and you can see him.
[1:42:14] Now, reach out and touch me. Reach out
[1:42:16] and touch. You're not that far gone. You
[1:42:18] still got hope. You still got breath in
[1:42:20] your lungs.
[1:42:23] Now, if that little woman,
[1:42:28] if that little woman in that position
[1:42:30] could believe that man and have that
[1:42:32] much confidence in that man, and all of
[1:42:34] a sudden, Satan gets scared and lose its
[1:42:37] ability and lose its ability to hold its
[1:42:40] hold its hold on her eyes so that she
[1:42:43] could begin to see what happened. The
[1:42:45] anointed word struck her. And what did
[1:42:48] she see? She saw herself in the word
[1:42:50] that he was talking about her.
[1:42:54] He was not talking about the next person
[1:42:56] beside her. There's a lot of times that
[1:42:58] we get pitchfork religion and we try to
[1:43:00] throw it over on this one and we try to
[1:43:02] throw it over on that one. They got cold
[1:43:05] on God and they missed out on the
[1:43:06] blessings. But truly, God is trying to
[1:43:08] open our eyes.
[1:43:13] I got your attention. So, let me now
[1:43:15] preach to you. If he did it once, he can
[1:43:19] do it again. If he did it for brother
[1:43:21] Randall when he hung his when he hung
[1:43:24] his harp up on a willow tree and all of
[1:43:26] a sudden God said, "Take it down." Then
[1:43:29] God is here to give you your gift back.
[1:43:32] He's here to give your anointing back.
[1:43:35] Let me say, if he opened blind eyes
[1:43:37] then, he will open blind eyes now. If he
[1:43:40] healed then, he can heal now. And Satan
[1:43:43] will only try to scare you off and cheat
[1:43:46] you out of your inheritance.
[1:43:48] But God cannot change his mind about
[1:43:50] you.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:58] Why shouldn't we
[1:44:00] believe? When it says in Mark 16, they
[1:44:04] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:44:06] shall recover.
[1:44:09] You go down. We're very familiar with
[1:44:11] verse 17, 18, and 19.
[1:44:15] But the Bible said, "And he went with
[1:44:18] them
[1:44:20] performing signs and wonders by his
[1:44:23] name, the Lord performing these things."
[1:44:27] It was not them. It was him on the
[1:44:31] inside of you. Now when a brother stands
[1:44:33] here and he says now if it doesn't make
[1:44:37] you feel uncomfortable
[1:44:39] lay your hands over on your brother and
[1:44:41] over on your sister. Do you realize that
[1:44:44] you are operating as an ambassador of
[1:44:46] all of heaven that if God has sent you
[1:44:49] that he has anointed you? He has
[1:44:51] equipped you and he has sent you with
[1:44:53] power. And it's not you that have the
[1:44:56] ability to lay your hands over them and
[1:44:58] heal them. But there is a supernatural
[1:45:01] power that is laying there on the inside
[1:45:04] of you. It's the lifegiving source of
[1:45:07] the Holy Ghost that when you lay your
[1:45:09] hands over on your brother,
[1:45:13] life
[1:45:15] transfers.
[1:45:20] Smith Wigglesworth was a powerful man, a
[1:45:24] very powerful minister right there
[1:45:25] before the before the prophet.
[1:45:28] It is it is it is said that Smith
[1:45:31] Wigglesworth
[1:45:32] raised 14 dead people.
[1:45:36] One of them was his wife Polly.
[1:45:39] She had a heart attack. And Smith so
[1:45:42] believed the word of God that if he laid
[1:45:45] his hands on her, she was going to get
[1:45:46] well.
[1:45:48] Smith went over there and he laid his
[1:45:49] hands on her. He said, "I give you your
[1:45:52] life back in the name of Jesus Christ."
[1:45:54] And all of a sudden, Polly stepped up.
[1:45:56] She says, "Smith,
[1:45:58] I know you want me, but Jesus wants me
[1:46:01] more." He said, "Well, then go in peace
[1:46:04] in the name of Jesus Christ." And she
[1:46:05] went back down.
[1:46:10] God knows what he's doing.
[1:46:14] Why is it, brother Andrew, we lay our
[1:46:15] hands on this one and they get healed
[1:46:18] and we lay our hands on that one and
[1:46:19] they don't God knows what he's doing.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; And believers throughout the history of
[1:46:27] the Bible trusted what God was doing. So
[1:46:30] why shouldn't we?
[1:46:39] How many years ago, brother Matthew, was
[1:46:40] it when all of a sudden you've been
[1:46:43] wearing those Mickey Mouse glasses as a
[1:46:45] little child and you got tired of
[1:46:47] wearing them bangs cuz he got headache.
[1:46:48] How many years ago was it?
[1:46:54] So around 28 29 years ago, he got tired
[1:46:58] of wearing glasses and getting headaches
[1:47:00] and he come down and had some men of God
[1:47:01] lay his hands on him
[1:47:04] and he's the only person in our family
[1:47:07] that hasn't had to wear glasses.
[1:47:10] So why shouldn't we believe?
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; How many years ago was it, mama, when
[1:47:15] they told you that you had sarcoidosis,
[1:47:17] but they first told Brother said, "If
[1:47:18] that's cancer, you better believe. You
[1:47:21] better pray, preacher." How many years
[1:47:22] ago was it?
[1:47:26] 11 years and she's still here. And the
[1:47:30] doctors gave her one report one time.
[1:47:33] How many years ago was it, Katie, when
[1:47:35] you couldn't have them with children in
[1:47:37] your womb? How many years ago was over
[1:47:39] 14 years ago? How many years ago was it
[1:47:42] when you fell off of a off of a ladder
[1:47:44] and you broke every vertebrae in your
[1:47:46] back and they said you never walk again?
[1:47:50] 90 1994.
[1:47:52] Just go ahead and walk real quick,
[1:47:54] Brother Ron.
[1:47:58] [Applause]
[1:48:04] Why shouldn't we believe?
[1:48:06] How many years ago was it? Was you in a
[1:48:08] fire?
[1:48:11] How many years ago was it when you got
[1:48:13] diagnosed with cancer and they told you
[1:48:14] you only had four months to live
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; five years ago? Then why shouldn't we
[1:48:19] believe?
[1:48:23] How many years ago was it, Brother
[1:48:25] Gabriel, when he was living in a
[1:48:26] basement
[1:48:28] and it didn't look like he was going to
[1:48:31] make it,
[1:48:33] but a prodal heard the father.
[1:48:39] If one prodal ran back home,
[1:48:42] then why can't we believe?
[1:48:46] Why? Why? Why?
[1:48:52] Tell me why I shouldn't praise him when
[1:48:54] the Bible said praise him on a high
[1:48:56] sounding symbol. Praise him on a low
[1:48:58] sounding symbol. Praise him with a
[1:49:00] string instrument. Praise him on the
[1:49:02] horns. Let everything that hath breath
[1:49:05] praise ye the Lord. If the Bible said
[1:49:08] praise, then why shouldn't we praise?
[1:49:15] Hallelujah.
[1:49:18] [Applause]
[1:49:33] David didn't know what he was doing.
[1:49:37] Simon Serene didn't know what he was
[1:49:39] doing. Paul didn't know what he was
[1:49:42] doing.
[1:49:45] The blind man in John chapter nine
[1:49:47] didn't know what he was doing his entire
[1:49:49] life. Why am I living this way?
[1:49:54] But one day
[1:49:56] there was a little bitty girl
[1:50:00] that heard about a man from Camden,
[1:50:02] Arkansas
[1:50:04] that had received his healing
[1:50:06] and she believed if I can just do the
[1:50:09] healer.
[1:50:11] Now, where did she get that kind of
[1:50:13] faith at?
[1:50:17] The man in John chapter nine, we don't
[1:50:18] know his name,
[1:50:21] but we do know the results that come
[1:50:23] after him.
[1:50:25] Many people will never remember your
[1:50:27] name after you're gone.
[1:50:30] They might say, "Well, you know, there
[1:50:31] was a white-headed man that used to
[1:50:33] stand up there, big burly man. He
[1:50:35] preached a lot of funerals."
[1:50:37] And they might not remember his name,
[1:50:40] but they will remember what he stood
[1:50:42] for.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that will not
[1:50:47] remember what you did in this life and
[1:50:49] what kind of job you had and how much
[1:50:51] how many times you went to work, but
[1:50:53] they will remember that you were
[1:50:55] faithful to go to the house of the Lord.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; If the Bible said that we should go to
[1:51:00] church, then why shouldn't we? If the
[1:51:04] Bible said that we should not forsake
[1:51:06] the assembling of ourselves together,
[1:51:08] then why should we? If the Bible said,
[1:51:10] like David said, I was glad when they
[1:51:13] said unto me, I was glad when they said
[1:51:17] unto me, I was glad when they said unto
[1:51:21] me, let us go to the house of the Lord.
[1:51:27] Then why shouldn't we be happy about it?
[1:51:33] I'll tell you what,
[1:51:36] God knows how to make me real nervous
[1:51:38] when it comes to sermons.
[1:51:42] But why shouldn't I trust him?
[1:51:47] He's been faithful
[1:51:49] over and over again.
[1:51:52] John Nine didn't know what he was doing.
[1:51:55] Brother Ron could ask question why he
[1:51:56] went through the fire and why he fell
[1:51:58] off the fell off of these things. And
[1:52:00] Sister Nancy could answer question
[1:52:02] things. Why did God do this? Why did Why
[1:52:04] did he take Why did he take brother
[1:52:05] Homer? Why did this these accidents
[1:52:07] happen?
[1:52:10] There's somebody here
[1:52:13] that knows.
[1:52:15] There's somebody here that needs that
[1:52:17] testimony.
[1:52:19] So why shouldn't we fully obey him no
[1:52:22] matter what he leads us to?
[1:52:29] I'm g I'm gonna ask them to pause the
[1:52:31] stream just for a minute
[1:52:34] that there was a boy that had wanted to
[1:52:37] live right. He wanted to do right and he
[1:52:41] tried his very best to get back to the
[1:52:43] father's house, but he had spent all of
[1:52:46] his father's living. and he'd spend it
[1:52:49] on the righteous things and he spent it
[1:52:50] doing these things and doing this this
[1:52:52] that and the other and he went out and
[1:52:54] he lived his entire life doing the wrong
[1:52:56] things.
[1:52:58] But he woke up
[1:53:01] and you know where he woke up at? He
[1:53:04] woke up in the pig's pin
[1:53:08] and said, "You know what?
[1:53:12] I know that my father's got all kinds of
[1:53:15] things in his house. I knowing that he's
[1:53:17] got the ability to restore everything to
[1:53:20] me. He's got servants in my in his house
[1:53:23] that are eating better than me.
[1:53:26] He's got every He's got everything
[1:53:29] there. He's got He's got money. He's got
[1:53:32] splendor. He's got He's got the best of
[1:53:34] the best. And I'm down here living with
[1:53:36] the pigs.
