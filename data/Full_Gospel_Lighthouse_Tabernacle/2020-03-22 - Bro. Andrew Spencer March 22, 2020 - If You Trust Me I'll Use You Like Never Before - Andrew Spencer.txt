we so appreciate your goodness towards the Lord and His goodness towards us and we just appreciate each and every one of you by by the way of prayer we feel your prayers this morning lifting us up and standing with us in the gap and we know that there is one greater that is with us and we can see and he's told us where two or three are gathered we thank you for assembling yourselves together in your homes today we thank you for for the cheer the children of God that have gathered here to make these things available and God has been with us through every step of the way and so we're very thankful to be standing in this moment and be standing with you and so we we bring you greetings from our pastor this morning he is home and is recovering from the surgeries that he's had and so we're so thankful that that God has brought him through again and I'd like to show a share a picture with you if that's okay hey man that right there is a champion a champion of champions and there's his queen with him amen we thank the Lord for our pastor and pastor's wife and we're just very appreciative of the good things that the Lord has done and I say boo devil I say boo devil God has God has won another victory Satan came in for another blow this past week and and blood clots were found in his lungs and legs and the doctors were able to put in a screen and and to see those things and brother on is feeling better they went ahead with the Gamma Knife radiation procedure they were going to hold off but dealing with what he is dealing with and what where we are in the world they wanted to go ahead and move forward with those things and I believe that the prayers of the Saints move those things forward and the angel of the Lord protected him and preserved his life again and his brother Matthew has said this morning we're expecting nothing but full victory and we're going to come out on the winning side of these things and so we just appreciate you being with us today and we thank you for taking the time to be a part of this service lifting up your hands and worshiping and I pray that the angel the Lord would go by your address today and physically be there present with you to comfort you and strengthen you in this hour this will be our service schedule until until further notice eleven o'clock on Sundays and we just appreciate the Lord for protecting us we know that the Bible tells us that though there'll be no plague that will come now that dwelling and we plead the blood of Jesus Christ so husbands fathers I admonish you to apply the blood the token life of Jesus Christ across her family's life across your home like never before it is your duty as the husband as the head of the home to make sure that the blood is applied and to make sure that the token of Christ is is over the doorpost of every one of your hearts and so this is a time like never before to listen to the message and if you do not have way of streaming or not have the ability to be able to stream different different archives like brother Donny's and brother brother Tim's and our services I admonish you if you're viewing this with your family and do not have the ability to go back and look over archives and streams listen to this message like never before but I would admonish you to listen to the last five services that brother Branham preached I believe that God is speaking special things to us in those moments and so to go back and study over those sayings and to indulge in things of God for I believe God is speaking to us and I believe God will speak to us today we thank you for for all those that have sent in their tithes to the address there that we had provided we appreciate those things and we know that God is blessing you for that so we pray that the the abundance of the Lord would pour out his blessings upon you and so we have so appreciate that and for your giving unto the Lord and so we just want to remind you to stay safe during all of these things to make sure that you take care of the precautionary things and washing your hands as you always should but just do the things and and just be precautionary in these things and keep that social distancing as they say to us to do so we're just we're just expecting from the Lord this morning I'm going to move forward in in this service but maybe before we would move forward to the word maybe we could sing that song lily-of-the-valley let your sweet aroma fill my life a man trust you ready for the word this morning our hearts are hungry for him to speak to us we're just looking unto the Lord [Music] you how to row [Music] god [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] beware Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'll never say [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] fast when I say sad [Music] Jesus [Music] preaches shine [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen if you would take your Bibles this morning and turn with us over to the Book of Isaiah chapter 26 and verse 1 this morning as you're turning through the Leafs of your pages of the Bible they're flipping through the pages and the promises of God just now I'd like to speak to you on a thought that was spoken by the Lord to our pastor brother Ron Spencer on the morning of December the 22nd before we ever got into the midst of the battle and before things begin to get heated our Lord Jesus Christ spoke these words to our pastor but Iran has relayed these things to us several times ministers around the world heard these things God's placed it on my heart this morning to speak to you these words is what the Lord spoke brother Ron said that when he spoke he spoke like a gentleman and he said if you'll trust me I'll use you like never before if you trust me I'll use you like a never before this morning this sermon makes me anxious not in a fearful way but in it victorious anxiousness I am anxious to see what God is willing and wanting to do I do not believe that these things were spoken pertinently pertinently to brother on just for himself but I believe that they are spoken to us as his children and the bride of Jesus Christ that we've seen mighty victories in the past we've seen supernatural things happen in the past we've seen them happen this week but the bride of Jesus Christ I ask that you hear me this morning I do not want this to be just another sermon but an anthem to you that if you trust him he will use you like never before Isaiah chapter 26 and verse 1 in that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah we have a strong City salvation will got a point four walls and Bohr walks open ye the gates that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in I love these words now we'll keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusted in thee and that is why you can have perfect peace is because you're trusting in the author of life verse 4 trust ye in the Lord trust she in Jehovah trusts you in Hell Oh him forever not just in the battle not just in despair not just in the time of trouble but forever trust she in the Lord for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength for he bringeth down them that dwell on high the lofty city he lay if it low he lay if it low even to the ground he brings it to the dust the foot shall tread it down even the feet of the poor and the steps of the needy may be just where you're standing at if you have a need by the way of lifting up your hand and the by the way of prayer lift your hands not before a man but before the great I am who is omniscient omnipresent and omnipotent and lift your needs and lift out your voices this morning to the great I am who will answer your cry Heavenly Father we come to you this morning Lord in the spirit of humility and the spirit of worship father we come before you lord and your August presence is ever so near to us in these moments father Lord we may not have as as needed father as the many as we normally would but father we have exactly what is needed today to bring your presence down where you said where two or three are gathered in our own assemblies at home and our own assemblies at church here this morning we feel your presence more because your promised word told us that you'll not leave us nor forsake us and father there are there are many afflictions that have come by though or axises way there's many diseases that have come by the righteous way but your the Lord our God that delivers us from all of them and Father we're just asking Lord just now Lord that you would hear our cry for the blood of Jesus Christ father you see the needs that we have father you see the uplifted hands father just now Lord those that are shuddhi and father lord these are not the way that we expect things to go but father this is how you have this is how that you have led us in this hour and I pray that you'd comfort every heart and every need just now go by their way and may the wind of the Holy Ghost set is moving in this place moved by their home just now and minister to them in life and peace and health O God and may they not fear father for they know that the one that is walking on the water is the son of man that that has come to bring deliverance and to come to bring victory and to bring peace to the storm of life father I pray that as these words are spoken this morning that you would be glorified and magnified in our midst bless the word today bless your children anoint us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen god bless you this morning as we said we like to speak to you this morning by the help of the Lord that if you'll trust me I'll use you like never before brother Branham said that if I wasn't for Jesus I'd be here against him God grant the day when men and women will be what they say they are if you're a Christian live like it be like it act like it if you're not be against it so people will know where you're standing if I didn't believe it I'd be against it but I'm willing to my soul on any phase of that word on any face of that word to say that its truth I believe that it's the inspired Word of God and I believe that every word of it it's inspired and I'm willing to trust my life now that's a huge statement in every spot and every walk of life that I'm willing to trust my life anytime on God's Word and his promise for it is true we live in a very uncertain time in a very uncertain age where things are changing but yet the Word of God is not changing and I love what the Bible tells us here in Isaiah to trust you in the Lord forever you see the sense of it is that let your confidence in God on no occasion fail let your faith let your trust and in no occasion fail let no calamity let no distress no let no adversity no persecution no poverty no trial of any kind prevent your trust in him I love what the Prophet says when he speaks these things he speaks of the truth and he speaks of the strength and the power of God he does not mean power he does not mean power which is not being used or that is unemployed but a power of Almighty God that is active that is energetic which is actually being exerted upon you his children in these moments which is exactly it is exerted to you in your need and the power and the strength of the Lord is forever and it's not changing it's not moving it's not backing up God is moving forward people may be backing up the government may be backing up science may be backing up but God's not backing up and he is exerting that power towards his children and which he is going to bring about and expect it in its an everlasting strength it's an almighty strength it's an omnipotent strength because he's God it's God it's not man's power it's God's power he's not changing he's not moving he's not backing up and our faith ought to rise to the challenge this morning it ought to move to the challenge of the word to move all the continued advances of the enemy that have Baden have beaten us and have come and buffeted us our faith ought to rise above the challenge of the enemy i'faith ought to rise above all the circumstances that we're going through no matter what it is God is not changing for neither the truth nor his justice nor his power nor his goodness is temporary or feeding or fading away but God continues to always be God we live in an hour of lay on a seal where things are constantly changing it's a day of people's rights but it seems like the people's rights are being taken away from them but here this thing has not caught God off-guard God knows exactly where we're standing at he knows exactly what we're going through and what we're facing and we can trust in this God we can believe in this God we can accept his power and his truth towards us Dwight Moody's favorite verse throughout the whole Bible was Isaiah twelve and two and he said that I will trust the Bible says I will trust and not be afraid and the white moody would say that he would say that you can travel first-class or you can travel second-class to heaven he said second class is what time I am afraid I would trust but first class is that I would trust and not be afraid that is the better way why not buy a first-class ticket this morning why not buy a first-class ticket this morning that instead of in the hour of update of 12 more trust in him but in before you ever get in that battle trust in him before you get in despair trust in him I believe that the bride of Jesus Christ has a first-class ticket all the way to glory and there's not going to be one circumstance there's not one to be one sickness there's not going to be one virus there's not going to be anything that stands between her and our first-class ticket all the way through the rapture the word trust is confidence it's a reliance arresting of the mind on the integrity of the veracity or justice of a friendship of a of another sound principle of a person so if you say that you trust somebody you are trusting in the integrity of that person the justice of that person the roar acity of that person and the principles of that person I'd say that jesus is a god that we can trust in this morning for the bible tells us in proverbs 29 that he put if his trust in the lord he that putteth his trust in the lord shall be safe what a thing to think about this morning in the hour that we're facing that that they that put their trust in the lord shall be safe when the world is afraid in the world is panicking it shows that there's no birth when they're panicking but the bride of Jesus Christ is relaxing and resting and waiting in that promise of God trust is he or that which is the ground of confidence the ground of confidence and the Bible says in Psalm 71 for the how are my hope God is the ground of confidence Oh Lord God thou aren't my trust from my youth and I'll think about these things that we have looked at as a church from 20/20 since the beginning of the year that that God is with us that God is with us and we will see miracles and throughout these past three months we have seen miracles transpire in front of us and I think that it's so amazing and I think that we as the people of God need to catch what is really taking place here I believe that that while the world is shifting and changing we ought to have our eyes on one person and that's none other than Jesus Christ one that ain't changing there's no variableness in him there's perfection in him but we look at these things that we look as everything is transpiring in Tom how that everything is moving moving into God's plan and here we are and we're watching these things transpire and we're watching the miracles of God happen right in front of us and I'm asking you as a church do not take these things lightly this is God preparing you for a body change when you look at the miracle when you look at the miracle of babies walking when you look at the miracles of hair that is growing back on the head that has never came back upon a head when you look at sister Mariah Pruitt and you look at sister Esther when it was looking impossible for a miracle to take place then God stepped in I want you to know your faith may rest in this God today you can rest in this God because he's a God that keeps his promises he's a God that won't let you down you may be shut in at home but you can count on God you may get lonely but God's air you may get tired of being alone but God's there you don't have to be shook up and worried and panicking you can rest in the promises of God because Almighty God said that I will be a comfort to you hallelujah you look at all these things that are transpiring through the Battle of this camp so that has come against our pastor I hate to even say that word but I want you to know this hell I want you to know this that it will be a pleasure for us as the bride of Jesus Christ to help throw you into the lake of fire you may be attacking us now but you will be to feed it you cannot conquer us you cannot defeat us you cannot destroy us but we will destroy you we will destroy you we look at these things and it looks like Satan would stop you from coming to church and stop you from worshipping he's tried to come in with a little sucker punch as it were and try to make you stay at home and not go to church but God still got through you see that maybe a virus had a circling the world but God's purpose and it's promised we'll still get through and I want to put hell on notice this morning you will not be able to stop the bride of Jesus Christ you will not be able to make us waver because our faith is not what we can see our faith is in the unseen around our faith is in Almighty God my faith is in the promise my faith is in Almighty God that will bring his promises to pass he star he's not changing he's a God that we can trust in and we trusted him all the way through every battle and he's had his hand upon you all throughout your life he's had his hand upon you you've watched him as you watch him as he ministered to you in your life he spoke to you in your life but now he is saying to you if you trust me I will use you like a never before notice the power of that question that if you trust me little bride you've had victories in the past you've had powerful times in the past you've had anointing in the past you've had strength in the past you've had none other than me in your realm but if you trust me through all of this chaos I will use you like never before I want to tell you to get ready get ready for the promises of God get ready for the things that are getting ready to transpire and watch for Jesus watch for him the Bible says in proverbs three and five trusts in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct my plans in all thy ways acknowledge him acknowledge him in the morning acknowledge him in the evening acknowledge him in good times acknowledge him in victory acknowledge him when it seems like you're in defeat acknowledge him in pain acknowledge him in health acknowledge the Lord God Almighty and all thy ways he will direct thy paths live in an hour we're where we are where we're living in a spot where everybody's self-confident and relying upon themselves everybody's confident in themselves and where they're at and they're there they're confident in their monies they're confident in their 401ks well that was till two weeks ago they're no longer confident they don't know what's coming they don't understand what's shifting they don't understand what's causing this or what's driving this but I believe that with all of my heart that this is Satan trying to stop the move of God I believe that with everything that's within me that he's trying to stop the move of God but he will not stop us from worshiping in our homes worshiping in our cars worshiping in our life applying the blood of Jesus Christ we're not confident ourselves we're confident in the blood your immune system may get weak but he don't get weak for in the time of trouble I will hide you in my pavilion I'm not comforted in my own house I'm comforted in his word that has housed me in this blood sale of the blood of Jesus Christ we're not relying upon ourselves we're relying on God the life of God we have it there as simply no confidence that you could have in your flesh your flesh will let you down your flesh world your flesh it'll make you it'll make you uncertain of what you're going through as you get older you'll find out that your flesh will let you down you won't be able to do the activities that you once did as you get older in time but you know that brother Branham said that God trusted Moses and him being a prophet Moses being a prophet of the Lord God trusted Moses but God did not trust the flesh part he trusted the God part in Moses you see because even Moses being a prophet had mistakes he had mistakes but God was not trusting in the flesh he was trusting in what he deposited on me and out of him because you look in the book of Exodus and you see the things that Moses did Moses had a temper God didn't trust in that Moses Moses he was told by God to Moses that to go and speak to the rock and Moses smooth the rock twice you see what you've got Moses doing that which is a type of smiting the rock and Moses smites it twice you see what you've got it doing you've got it beaten Christ twice you don't have to be Christ twice for your human he's already healed too when he took those straps a pilot's judgment all that was enough but God was not trusting in the flesh he was trusting in what he has deposited in his germ seed of life now notice this that's what got the church in trouble today it's too many educated preachers without being born of the Spirit men and women like to listen to intellectual speeches and instead of the preaching of the power and the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's what's got us all in trouble today we don't need anything more we don't need any more high school education for preachers we need God called me and that's filled with the Holy Spirit and not some man-made theology and some denomination we need God called me God called men not so not solely resting upon yourself but God called me you know in your own self when you met him and when the change came and you're no longer relying on the old man you're relying on what he deposited the Bible says in Romans nine eleven and here we watch this for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not a works but of him that calleth you see it was by election that his purpose might stand in the predetermined plan of God he foreknew every attribute of you and it's his purpose that it would stand in this hour and nothing can defeat his purpose his covenant was not destroyed when Adam fell nor when he failed it was not destroyed in catch gone off guard God seen what would take place God seen what would transpire and your mistakes does not change God's attitude towards you and what he thinks about you God can't love you no more and God can't love you no less you see you're always going to have human mistakes but God does not annoy his covenant towards you you see your choices your free moral agency will take you away from God but your election come on somebody your election will draw you to God you see it's not him that will ignore him that runneth but it's God that shows mercy it's not he that understands nor his ability you can't trust in yourself you can't trust in your abilities to sing you can't trust in your abilities the briques you can't trust in your flesh but there is an election your flesh will not get you in a rapture but there's a germ seed of God that will put you in the rapture when we see national force pushing this way but we see God pushing upward these are the things of God the Prophet said why do you trust in the flesh of horses and why do you trust in atomic power why do you trust in the things of this world and your houses in your places in your position take God at its work and write all through the atoms yonder into the spheres calendars into the heavens and whatever God is promised I love this God would you can ride on the atoms of those words because God will bring you to that spot that he's ordained you to be there's been many of things that have happened in your life that looked like it was going to stop you from being where you are as a son as a daughter of God but just keep riding on that word there may be sickness come that you keep riding on that word that maybe Tomos come there maybe letdowns come there may be Deaf sitcom but you keep riding on that word family may leave you but God will leave him Tom may fail you but God will fail you circumstances were changed but God won't change hallelujah when you look over in the Bible you see Amram and you hear the prophet as he's watching this whole thing transpire before him how that Amram is praying and hem ramus is there in the promise has been given to Abraham and his seed after him that there would come a deliverer that would deliver them from the hand of the enemy of the Egyptians mram was steady before God he was willing to stand there in front of the all the opposition being beaten making bricks but he still trusted what God had said and the Prophet watches as this transpires before him that ham Rams they're praying to God and all of a sudden the angel Gabriel steps into that realm where mram can watch him watch him as he starts speaking to him and he says hammer ahem I've seen you in your prayer you've been faithful you've been a blessing you've been have you been watching for the promise and I'm sending you and Joseph bad the promise you see Ameren was not trusting in his own flesh he was trusting in what God had said that God would send a deliverer that he bring him out with a mighty hand and hear the angel come and says I've heard her prayers and he runs down to the steps and he tells Joseph men and the Prophet said look at Joe Sabet how beautiful she was Joseph bad and Ameren start conversing over these Saints that these are the things that we've been looking for I can imagine as they begin to weep over these things and all of a sudden she asked Amram what did the angel look and he starts describing to her - what the angel looks like and he says honey we can trusted him you see days before he had been beaten he'd been making bricks and he was trusting in the promise but when he went out the next morning to go make more bricks he was still trusting in that promise but he was singing from a different spot you see he had trusted him before and he knew that God was going to use him like never before and held of his loins came a deliverer all parents do you realize that if you're standing on the promises of God that your children if you put before them this token that they will not forget the things that you have said and you may be used in one way but you will be used in a wholly different way through your children he's going to use you like never before he's going to bless you like never before he's going to anoint you like never before he's going to speak to you like never before who he's going to bless the children of God like never before because he's God and he can and as they are watching the transpiring of Egypt coming down on them the government coming down on them and they're pushed in isolation to hide their baby to hide the baby to hide the promise to hide the things that are happening around them and they have to push the promise they trusted in the word they've got the word they've got the promise and now they've got to push the promise out and they've got to trust this promise they've got to trust what the angel said and they push this treasure out of their heart when they push it out onto the LA River and the old crocodiles coming up I could see God I could see God as our race raised him from his phone you know there's a lot of trials that go on down here but there's somebody looking at them all the time that ought to give you confidence when you're going through a trial that somebody's watching you watching how you react Full Gospel lighthouse let me speak to you specifically the world is watching how you react to this battle you are the ones that are standing shoulder to shoulder you're the ones that are facing these things you're the ones that are standing here as closest friends as loved ones and you are facing these things and the world is watching how you react to this battle I say let the world see us in victory don't never let a negative testimony or a negative thought come out of your mouth it may pass through there but don't you worry about the water yes you trusting God's promises who they love not their life from the death and when poor old Amram with his only beloved little child little Joseph bet that had nursed to our bosom and then had put him in the ark and push it out in the bullrushes when the alligators were fat on the little babies then which he was standing there and the tears running down her cheeks dog said come here table come here a minute I want to show you something I got somebody that really believes in me I'd say that the angel Gabriel has gathered around the bride of Jesus Christ in this hour and saying watch this gay bro watch what second place you announce to them a message you announce to them a message it's going to bring them out watch them they're trusting in me who God let me be that type of person that can say God said so and it'd be so dead to anything else till it becomes a sounding brass and or a tinkling cymbal said come here Gabriel all you angels come out here I want to show you something see that man down there with his hands up I'd say there's people that are standing with the hands up pushed his own maybe helped I know that some of you pushed your product was out on that water I know that some

through the receiving in just get ready you run with everything that's within a let us run this race with patience at the end of the line stands Jehovah he stands there this Almighty God and ragaman toshiba didn't know how this was going to happen but they trusted the word if you'll trust me i'll use me like never before that's the same thing he does today when a man puts his trust in the lord jesus and confesses his sin the Holy Ghost takes ahold of that man and Christ stands at the receiving end and he tells you don't you fear to go anywhere or do anything for the never-failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you whenever you go brother Jeffrey you were in that vision that morning right after the Lord said if you trust me I'll use you like never before you're a part of a vision

Jordan rather be no pain no be no tears be no cross but only rejoicing holy rejoicing hallelujah the Bible says in Psalms 34 and 22 the Lord redeemed the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate none of them that trust in him shall be guilty I say that some of you can give praise right there I'd say every person could give praise right there that those that trust in him shall not be desolate you will not be considered guilty you will not be considered filthy but you are washed you are cleanse you are justified you are a blood part blood wash Church of the Living God and the flames of fire around you for a testimony for the Living God to use you in this hour to stand and God shake the world with your testimony not guilty not accuse not condemned hallelujah is that not what Paul told us there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit you see if you're walking after the flesh you're still guilty if you're walking after the flesh you're still condemned but if you are walking after the spirit there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus Psalms 36 and 7 how excellent is thy loving-kindness O God therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of our wings some 62 and 8 trust in him at all times in good times and bad times in a moment of a pandemic trust in him David said that I would bless the Lord at all times I will bless His Holy Name and will not forget his benefits trust in him at all times she people pour out your heart before him this is the time to pour out your heart before God this is a time to to rest in the promises of God for God is a refuge for us sell our brother branham said our actions show what we are if we say that we have faith and then afraid to step out and claim our faith and put it to work then our faith doesn't do us much good the Bible said that faith without works is dead just as the body without the Spirit is dead so faith without works is dead you see David was anointed before he ever got the battle and so have you been anointed by accepting what Eve has turned down you have been anointed in this Hauer but before David ever faced his Goliath David trusted in God he trusted in God when he faced the line he trusted in God when he faced the bear he trusted in God when his brothers told him that he was just coming down to watch the flight but the brothers didn't realize that he was going to be the one that carried out the victory and people may criticize you but you're going to be the ones that carry out the victory in this battle David trusted in God before he ever got in the valley before he went and spoke of Saul we trusted in God and God was going to use him like a never before you see before it ever it David ever got down there in the Valley of Elah he didn't have to pull out a measuring stick and find out how tall Goliath was how big his shekels were and his armor was he didn't have to figure out how long his finger was Goliath was proud about how big he was he was boasting how big he was a lot of people want to get caught up with how big Goliath was either way at the end of the road Goliath was dead they were still dead and don't matter how tall he is how sore he is no matter the demons that are facing you and car trying to conquer you trying to destroy you he don't matter if they're little bitty or if they're great big you just remind him that they're going to be dead at the end of the road hallelujah David he knowed what he believed he had that little old slingshot wrapped around his fingers like this in the way he went to me Goliath around and around and he said five stones he had five stones j esus what was what was in his fingers fa ith faith wrapped up in Jesus and here he went brother I'm telling him it's hit the rock to the killing place and downed a Goliath and dealt with Goliath you know what happened he used one stone to knock delgo life and all it takes is one word little broad one word and it'll destroy your enemy for the word of God is greater the Word of God is stronger the Word of God is more powerful than any sickness any demon any distress the Word of God one word will put the devil in his place what about when you start taking your position as a son of God and war is up and on hail and you release one word cancer has to stop sugar diabetes has to stop loneliness has to stop because one word he said you know what happened then the Israelites took courage and a way they went they cut Philistines plumb to the walls when the venom said it just takes one that's got enough courage to step out say it's right and God said so brother you down the Goliath and your whole family will go to cutting Philistines the first thing that you know oh the first thing that you know if you start taking courage I think it's amazing that we're watching a champion of champions in Brother on Spencer step out and we're right behind him we're watching him but can you realize what the enemy thinks he's doing to brother on but what he's doing to the rest of the congregation of Israel that it's given her courage to run out and the tear down the walls tear down destruction tear down homo tear these things down rather on you're all giving us courage to run this race to fight down bring down and battle out the demons in our life and we will not be defeated but we will overcome hallelujah what's in your hand what can you do some people say what can I do testify about sing a song about it if the devil don't like you talking about the are just keep talking about God if the dividend like you singing about God just keep singing about God do something for the glory of the Lord trust him through the battle trust him when you're standing right in front of the Goliath you remember the story I told you a while back about the man about the man telling a pastor the pastor said I know I know that God is with you and the pastor taught him said you know I can walk across that log right there and he walked across that log he said I know you can do that because the Lord is with you he said I can take a wheelbarrow cross there he said I know you came because the Lord is with you he said he said I can pack a log and I can go across her with a wheelbarrow he said I know you came because the Lord is with you and then the pastor tells him to get in the wheelbarrow he said now wait a minute you see it comes different when you're facing and trusting in your own life that you're putting your life in God's hands but I want you to know that you can get in the wheel barrel of this word and it'll protect you it'll take you through the fires it'll take you through the storms of life you can trust in this I wonder who's willing to get in the wheel barrel this morning this is a season of the Lord this is a seizing of the moving of the Lord we see the angel coming down and troubling the waters this is the hour I wouldn't wait I'd get in the water right now I'd say that the angel of healing is here get in the water I'd say that the healing angel is moving across our congregation across the bride of Jesus Christ giving her courage giving her confidence giving her instruction to stand in the water they come out whole you don't have to be the one waiting for Jesus to come by you can get in right now because by His stripes are already healed you don't have to wait down there by the water just get in it stand in that water this is the season of it you can take courage because this is the morning that we step in and we don't get out once you get in that water and I'm not just talking about some holy water that you can buy some from some fountain or from some boat some Pope or some bishop that you can brave you can break out on the bottle and they say it's holy water but I'm talking about getting in the word I'm talking about getting in the water of this word when you go to praising God for what he's already done and all of a sudden that healing angel that promised that he would come he stands guard over you and he wraps his wings around you and says you're sheltered in the wings of Almighty God for they that wait they that trust in the Lord he will renew their strength brother Branham said in perfecting the church called perfecting his church brother when you got a courage enough to step out and toe to toe to toe the line with the devil and scat him off he said if I went to my house tonight I got a legal deed for my house if I went in there and someone was laying down there drinking and carrying on and doing wrong I'd say you have to get out friend well this is a house for human beings I got a right to be in here I'd say you do not possess this house it's mine well he'd say I got a right just like a sickness enter the body or sin or whatever it is say well the other ones drink the other ones do this or the other ones be this way but he has no legal rights and I could take my abstract deed and go down to the courts and say looky here someone has moved in and that doesn't belong there this is mine it belongs to me and the law would come up and put them out because I have an abstract written deed to that property brother and sister we have an abstract written deed to life to salvation to divine healing and the devil has no rights trust God and the Holy Ghost to put him out you ain't got to put him out the Holy Ghost to put him out your baptism of the Holy Ghost will rise up on the inside of you and push the demon of cancer push the demon of fear right out of your life don't fear the promise is coming well I don't see it coming faith looks past what you see with these eyes it looks past the census faith sees what the body cannot some people say we're not going to have a rapture but I see it some people said we're not going to have a body change but I see it some people are saying we're not going to see miracles but I see it I see them coming I see him telling us that we're not going to leave this world I see him telling us that will not be changed but the Bible tells me that he's going to change me in a moment in a twinkling of an eye I can trust him through this battle and he will look upon us they stood for me I'll stand for them and pull them up and gravitation will lose its hold we're trusting in his promises you may not see it coming you may not see the miracle right before you but let me tell you the manifestation of the miracle is coming and it will be visible it's already invisible it's already there it's already moving it's already changing your life it's already changing your heart is not shook up this morning faith knows where it's standing out faith is resting in the promises of God you can have confidence in this word I'd say if Jesus had confidence in his word you and I can have confidence in his word if Jesus could go to the cross with confidence in his heart knowing what the Bible said in Psalm 16 and 10 that that there will not that God will not allow he would not destroy this body that he could not destroy this body and it'd not be raised back up again because the Bible had told him the Word of God had told him that I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption and Jesus had confidence in what the word said he was so full of the quickening power that when they killed him he was so full of that quickening power that on the third day he had enough unction to be able to say to them destroy this temple and I'll raise it up again and there was so much power in the Word of God that even death could not hold Jesus back the stone could not hold Jesus back Rome could not hold Jesus back and I say that to you Church of the Living God Rome will not hold this body back we're gonna rise up out of the ground one of these morning's we're gonna rise her past her despair razza past our fears rise up past these things Rome won't stop us Satan won't stop us death won't stop us fear won't stop us the coronavirus won't stop us torment stop us cancer won't stop us fear won't stop us anxiety won't stop us depression won't stop us suicide won't stop us the enemy whispering in your ear you ain't gonna make it that's when the enemy when he comes in God raises a standard he may be flooding your mind with all kinds of things I'm gonna be shut in for two weeks that devil don't know what he's doing you're shut in and you're listening to a Prophet's were tell you to get ready come out of her sacrum a lock you up and pin you in a corner but I'll make a way of escape for it say to me Pina of cancer but God will make a way of escape for it Satan's tried to pin you in your home and he has no idea what he is doing you may be at your home enjoying these things of God but I want you to know Satan don't know what he's doing Satan ain't got a clue what he's doing because the bride of Jesus Christ her faith is lifting her faith is moving her faith is reacting and when we as the people of God get to assemble ourselves together again the Church of the Living God would take place in such a way that in a blow back the very eyebrows of Satan himself you have no idea Satan what you're doing we're studying like never before we're praying like never before we're eating this book were not eating just part of it we're eating the whole lamb and we've got isues on our feet and our rod in our hands and I children may be asking us daddy what you're doing I'm getting ready to take an exodus I'm getting ready to leave Oh hallelujah we've ate this book we've become this book we've seen the Son of Man come down we've watched some mighty angels stand in this our standing this day but you're not standing alone God we're standing with you he come to me that morning two weeks ago and woke me up at 242 in the morning and said let's stand I'd say that if a mighty angel could stand and Michael can stand what about us as the bride of Jesus Christ in Revelations 10-8 stand up and take the book eat the book become the book alleluia we're standing and we're feeding on the unfailing body word of the Son of Man Jesus had confidence in his power he had confidence in what he said he had confidence in the word and god's confident in what he's deposited in you he's confident that it will bring forth he's confident that it will produce you see God knew what he had placed in the woman at the well he was confident no sense and those he was living in a spot of sin yet God knew what she had on the inside of her young people middle-aged hold people I want you to hear me you hear me clear you're going to have up and downs you won't go through battles who won't go through moments there's going to be times when you ask yourself he's got around you may not see in with your eyes but God's right there you're gonna have ups and downs you're gonna have moments when you feel like nobody's or health but that's when he's got you there's a hiding place this morning there's a place that you can go to there's a place of refuge that you can run to there's a place that you can go to for comfort you see God is confident even though you may have heels and you may have valleys God is confident in what he deposited on you on the inside of you and your the final voice to the final heats your the final runners to let us run there's any time to be back enough rest of the world's getting their Series in there binge series on what they're watching on Netflix let's have our binge series a reading from Genesis or revelations let's not get caught up with the world stolen let's get caught up with God what God is doing if he said we're gonna be an invincible army then we're going to be too powerful to be defeated let's not get caught up with what Netflix is doing what key CNN's doing what Fox News is doing let's not get caught up with the coronavirus let's get caught up with God Laurie you're a special class of people you're bone of his bone life of his life word of his word power of his power you will see the same signs same warned us because you are another reproduction of the masterpiece Bible says in Isaiah 24 or 15 wherefore glorify you the Lord in the fires I'd say if you can trust him in a fire we have trusted him in a fire if we could praise him in a fire what are we going to do when we get outside the fire wherefore glorify you the Lord in the fires even the name of the Lord God of Israel in the Isles of the sea glorify you the Lord in the fires in your moment glorify Him and victory glorify Him when it seems her to feed it glorify him it's easy to trust when ain't nothing going on it's easy to trust when you've got two hundred people surrounding you but when you shut in by yourself can you trust me when it looks like the grips of death are trying to grab ahold of your life can you trust me it's easy to trust when nothing's going on twelve Spurgeon said this to trusting God to trust God and light in the light is nothing but to trust God and darkness is faith tis so sweet to trust in Jesus how I love him more and more it's so sweet to trust in Jesus that will wipe away your tears there's been moments in this battle I have not questioned why but I have questioned who who did this who caused this and we know that this battle came from Satan so we can send it back to Satan so we know who is trying to defeat us and we know who is trying to bring us victory there's been moments in this battle when I thought that the wave would overtake me and overwhelm me but as our pastor said I've been sick before but I made it I've been through storms before but I made it I cried before but I made it whoo I've been tried to been stopped before by Satan but I made it and I've trusted him before and I made it if I trusted him through the rest of my life what should I do now I'll just keep on trusting him but there's been moments that's a human being when you look and you think what more what next is coming but God says I'm preparing you I'm preparing you for a tremendous victory there's been moments in your own life when you've cried and you've asked God how much longer will I have to put up with this and God says trust me trust me I'll use you like never before he's going to use you're trying to bring about a victory when you look at the profit of the Lord in this hour when he lost his wife hope and now his little Sharon Rose is coming down to the spot which life is being depleted from her life is being taken from her her eyes are crossed and the black seat has come down between he and God but the Branham said then Satan moved in and says will you trust him now it's easy to trust God when everything is easy but when you're trusting God in the midst of these moments it's Satan himself moved in and said will you trust him now he's taking your wife he's taking your little girl but Satan didn't know what he was doing if you hear him say the Lord God gives and the Lord God takes away though he slay me yet I will trust him you could take my life but I'll still trust you can come with storms but I'll still trust you Satan you may come and try to move in and say will you trust him now and we scream back we'll trust him we'll trust him he'll lead us all the way he'll bring us all the way through you see the credit is due to the man that is in the arena when the man in the arena that is standing there all alone and he's still willing to stand there all alone when Satan's coming in with every gun and every tactic and every power and he's trying to stop the move of God and there's a challenge that is set before with you but will you answer the Challenger will you answer him will you answer him and stand alone in the ring with Satan and all of his forces you can hear the bell ring as a boxer steps under the ropes and the bell rings and the Challenger is standing out there before you the opposition is standing out there before you you can have a coach in your side you can have your coach in your over in your corner I preach to you this word I've told you this word you can have friends in your corner you can have that you can have sched spectators in your corner but remember at the end of the day that's all they are as spectators you're the one in the room you're the one in the ring in there you can have every confidence behind you telling you can make it but you're the one standing there I can tell you that if you accept the Word of God you'll make it through I can tell you by his stripes are healed and I can tell you that you'll make it through but when you take a hit maybe I don't feel the effect of the punch and you take it with full force and you can look back and say you don't know what you're talking about you've never been through this before you might be correct but there is somebody bigger than me in your corner he knows every blow he knows what you're going through the son of man may have not been battled by cancer in the flesh when he was here 2,000 years ago but do not ever think that he did not conquer cancer for when he was at the cross he felt the spirit of cancer he felt the spirit of depression he felt the spirit of loneliness he thought the spirit of every demon of hell and he wrapped his arms around all of those demons and said I take you and I destroy you for my body's sake he may have not conquered cancer he men not had cancer in his own body but don't you ever think that he didn't conquer it he conquered death hell and the grave you can line up all your demons right there and you'll never stop Jesus you can line up all your fears and you'll never stop Jesus come on somebody he Jesus may have never thought he man never had to go to the doctor for a prognosis of cancer but now in the body of the son of man he is conquering cancer for the body of Ron Spitzer he is conquering fear in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ in the body of Tim Pruett in the body of Donnie Reagan in the body in the body of his bride Jesus Christ is conquering everything that comes against you and you will not be to feed it he overcame every channel he overcame every obstacle and the son of man is conquering and I'd say that he's looking upon his children he says that's a body that I can trust that's a body that I can move in and that's what we're watching we're watching the moving of the body because you see the body is moving in accordance to the headship that has come down in this hour in the intellect that has come down that's not been another age and when the intellects came down but in this age the headship of Christ has come down and the headship is now working through a body a body he can move here a body he can breathe him a body he can live here a body he can overcome here and there on this in the inside of this body it's a rapture in faith that will lift you above it lifts you above it inside of this body is Jesus Christ if Jesus Christ conquered then he'll conquer now hello hello yeah bride of Jesus Christ the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth the angels don't know what it is to sing amazing grace but you're singing it victoriously the Angels don't understand the grace of God but you're singing it victoriously they don't understand you can sing you can imagine as God has the greatest angel choir surrounding him singing holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty well when you start singing you start singing the songs of victory the Angels have to step back because they don't understand they don't understand what you're going through they don't understand they don't understand what you're facing they don't understand because they can't sing from that spot but you can oh you can you may have battles but trust him to that battle and sing like never before you see when you go to singing the praises of God go up to God and God comes down and habits the praises of his people he's surrounding you with his presence he's surrounding you with his love and you are sheltered in his wings and they have to watch you or so they have to watch you when you start singing because he first loved me when you start singing from a body that has been redeemed the church world can sing songs and they become anointed to write songs but when the bride of Jesus Christ starts singing that so during her song she starts singing those songs of grace and mercy and peace and all of a sudden he becomes ever so evident that he's there beside you they Sara with you he starts inhabited your phrase out of you comes a worship out of you comes a praise then nobody else can understand but you're singing it from a spot that through all the trial you trusted him I love it to get out on the other side of a battle and I'll be honest with you I'm ready for the battle against the bride of Jesus Christ the ministry of Christ I'm ready to see victory I'd say that all of us as a church we're ready to see a complete victory and we will see that but I love that when you get on the other side of a trial the blessing on the other side of that thing you can shout like never before you can praise like never before and you can sing like never before and Satan hates it that's why he's trying to stop you he's trying to keep you from believing in a God that can he's trying to keep you from a believing in a God that will we know like Shadrach and meshach and abednego said when they were getting ready to go into the flames of the fire when they headed it up seven times harder than it was before that when they walked him getting ready to walk into it we don't know whether our God will but we know that he's able but we as a body believe more than he's able we believe that he will he's acting and moving in a body that believes that he will do it he said he do it I take him at his word they heated it up seven times harder and when they come out letting the King look down there said I thought we threw three in there but I see one like the son of man were walking in the flames of the fire and when they come out of the fire there was not even a smell on them of the flames he could not touch them he could not get in their garments sin has become very sticky and it's become the cry to try to stop you but it is not even a sin of sin on your life when the blood of Jesus Christ annihilates that sin he glows back up on the dead and the devil hates you for repenting because the brother branham said that when you repent it brings you out of the trap of the enemy so repent and get out of the trap God doesn't have no use for a coward if you're afraid to trust him don't even make an effort until you're satisfied that he keeps his word and he keeps his promise then there's nothing gonna stop you Psalms not a woman and for he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler his truth is something you could trust you you can imagine as that mother Eagle has the Prophet would tell us how that that mother eagle would take her eagerly talent for their flight for their first flight and she tells him don't be scared hang on to me don't be scared you can trust me don't be scared you can imagine as Abraham has waited for the promise for 25 years he trusted in the promise for 25 years he receives the promise and God was only receiving in of it he was only receiving another and he watched he watched his son Isaac grow up and now the same voice that had led him out let him out of his homeland let him to this land let him through every trial and he trusted him through that he trusted in him through the waiting of the baby he trusted him when he got the baby and now he takes the greatest walk of his life when the voice says take mine only son in Genesis 22 and sacrifice your only Son you're coming down to a spot I trusted but Abraham knew that if God was able to give me a child in in the deadness of my life in the deadness of Sarah's womb he's more than able to resurrect him up he didn't know how it was happening but he trusted him can you imagine as this is spoken to Abraham if you'll trust me through this I'll use you like never before that seed had to live through him came the Royal seed of Abraham and he trusted him like never before and all of a sudden he watched God watched his son taking his only begotten Son i pong cow golf is here and he wants his trust in his word and he watched what he said and he came and stayed the hand of Abraham he said and he called that place Jehovah Jireh for my Lord hath provided my sacrifice as the eagle mother Eagle tells her children trust me trust me and you'll use all wings like never before proud of Jesus Christ trust him and you'll use the old testament and the new testament wings like never before you've used it in the past to defeat satan with but watch what's getting ready to take place I'm going to use you like never before though God of all peace is destroying Satan under your feet whose feet is he going to use your feet if Abraham could trust him and did not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost what about you has the body of Jesus Christ you ought to be able to say like Paul said in Romans 8 and 38 for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord I'm persuaded that he's able to keep me I'm persuaded that nothing's gonna rob me I'm persuaded that nothing's gonna steal from me I'm persuaded that God is for me and if God is for me who can be against me I'm persuaded that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me I'm persuaded that no weapon that is formed against the bride of Jesus Christ shall prosper I am persuaded that when the enemy comes in like a flood that's when God raises a standard this is the time when the standard of the word of Jesus Christ is being raised like never before the Prophet said what we need today is a God resurrected from the dead and on hand right now to do whatever he promised he would do to confirm his word and we need delegates out there in the audience who's willing to rest their soul on any word that God said and put it to action that's what we need today that's what we need is men and women who stand up to the forefront there and call the devil a liar and say Jesus Christ stripped you and robbed you of every right you had and I'm in Christ Jesus and the world belongs to me a man blind Bartimaeus could trust him I can't - if the woman with the blood is who could trust him I can't - if the leopard could trust him I can't - if the servants at the wedding of Canaan could trust him to pour water into those vessels I can trust him that he'll pour the revelation into these into these vessels and he'll stimulate us like never before if they could trust him I could trust him if the disciples could trust him and Peter could trust him and said lord if it be you bid me come and he said it is I be not afraid I'd say us as the children of God we could trust in him we could believe in him and we could step out on the waters unafraid you can trust in him who can believe in him and you will bring a battle victory for none other than that Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior the Prophet said you're his victory the Prophet said that we don't trust in anything else but thus saith the Lord he said notice the harmony between the bridegroom and the bride she has thus saith the Lord of sets field that's what we're trusting in is thus saith the Lord this messages came the messengers came the message followed and the people of the message have taken it and Satan can't stop us if dad no trusted him in our lion's den back into if David trusted him in the Valley of Elah I can - if Abraham trusted him to bring back take out of his 318 servants and bring back everything that the enemy had stole I can - if David could trust Almighty God when he encouraged himself in the Lord to go out there and take back everything that the devil stole from him I can - if the he three Hebrew children could trust in him in the midst of the flames I came true he can't change he's the same God he's the same word he's the same yesterday today and forever they trusted in a supernatural God and I can trust in him what was the theme of this message Jesus Christ is same yesterday today and forever turn with me in your Bibles to Psalms chapter 56 and verse 1 as we bring begin to bring these things to a close Psalms 56 in verse 1 be merciful unto me O God for man would swallow me up he fighteth daily oppress with me enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against me although almost ah what time I am afraid I will trust in thee in God I will praise His Word in God have I put my trust I will not fear what flesh can do under me every day the rest my words all their thoughts are against me for evil they gather themselves together they hide themselves they mark my steps watch this when they wait for my soul shall they escape my iniquity and not anger cast down the people of God now tell us my wonderings put now my tears into the bottle are not they in that book they're in my book when I crime dove he then shall my enemies turn back this is a time to cry unto God and watch your enemies turn back if there ever was a time to pray if there ever was a time to cry out to God speak to God right now's the time for when you crowned him your enemies shall turn back this I know for God is for me in God I will praise His Word in the Lord will I praise His Word in God I have put my trust I will not be afraid what man can do unto me that vows are upon me O God I will render praises under thee for thou hast delivered my soul from death wilt thou not will not thou deliver my feet from falling that I may walk before the God in the light of the living who I have put my trust in God and I will not be afraid what man can do unto me but I love what David said that the enemy has marked my steps Satan is marching and he's marking your face he is marking where you walk down the Lord told us that every footstep was a possession how Hale hates to hear these testimonies that if brother wrong was brought through when he fell off of a 40-foot ladder and he trusted to them what is he gonna do when he trusts him now how Satan is marking our steps Lord o bride now that we're watching the testimonies of Esther watching the testimonies of Anna Thomas watching the testimony of Tim Pruett watching the testimonies of Donnie Reagan watching the testimonies of a living God living in his people how Satan hates that when he thought he had you in his scripts and all of a sudden he lose him because the Son of Man is still conquering in a body he is marking your steps he's afraid when you take afoot staff but I want you to know that the Bible tells us that he hath enlarged our steps that we might not slip if Satan is marking our steps and God said he's enlarged in our footsteps what about that Satan is marking every footstep that you take I'd say I start taking those steps into the Word of God like never before the bride has had victories he's marked those victories but he never seen what's getting ready to transpire because God has spoke to us directly and said that if you'll trust me you can answer me you can answer me by the way screaming out by the way of the internet and by the way of prayer and by the way of you speaking you cannot just say this to me but you can say this to God I'd say that God is asking every one of you this morning if you trust me do you trust him do you trust him he says if you trust me I'll use you like never before we trusted him to a snake bite and he used him like never before we trusted him through lightning through strokes through heart attacks and he used him like never before we trusted him through the fire we trusted him to a fire and he come out and he used him like never before I'd say that in the last 12 years maybe I could be wrong because I don't have the stat sheets of hell but I'd say in the last 12 years brother Anse ministry has put double the black eyes on the enemy there what he did before that I don't have the stats eats inhale but he'll knows he'll knows what happened he'll knows how many times they were defeated he'll knows when they had to tuck their tail and run back to hell and say they were defeated what I want you to get ready get your record books ready hell because Ron Spencer's ministry is being trusted by Almighty God and he's going to be used like never before Sohail get ready to get black eyes ready to get blue eyes ready to get bruised like never before for we as the army of God are behind him with everything that is within us and we trust him we trust him like a never before Alleluia little bride keep pressing on no matter what you come against in the upcoming weeks your shelter your sheltered and shut it in your homes but your sheltered in the arms of God be used like never before trust him like never before for the answers of God or nearer they're closer they're watching trust him trust him watch for him the moving of the angels here he's come to minister to you he's come to touch your life he's come to console your heart I tell you do not be afraid do not be afraid no plague will come now that dwelling there's a greater plague out there than the corona of ours and it's sin disease but it shall not come nigh thy dwelling with you that have loved ones out there that you're still claiming apply the token and send the Holy Ghost after them like never before this is not a time to be fearful and this is not a time to be afraid and this is not a time I'm sure that there are there are communities that are using these tactics to try to scare people into the kingdom of God but fear never drives you to God faith drives you to God don't allow the enemy to try to drive you into loving Jesus you love Jesus with all your heart you become closer to him like never before and when we come out on the other side of the sayings and we are join ourselves together may all the Angels watch us as we gather as we begin to worship as faith begins to rise and the rapture that is in the body now such take a hold of our lives don't you be afraid don't you fear you take the precautions like the government told you to take precautions but you trust Jesus you wash your hands like the doctors have told you but you trust Jesus I trust God but I still wear my seat belt I trust God by still washed my hands I trust God but I still go to the doctor I trust God in everything so just because we take these precautions as the body of Jesus Christ does not show that we do not distrust him it shows that we have common sense and we are trusting in a Living God there's a blood there's a blood that will protect you there's a blood that is for you if you trusted him before and you trust him through this I cannot even as I said this Herrmann makes me anxious to see what God is going to do what are the things that we face to God what are the things that we go through what are these things to God the Prophet said the least little touch of God is omnipotent it's all powerful it only takes one little touch and these things are dissolved God that spin the world off of his fingertips what are these things - God the promise of a son was coming there had been a dance I never had been a great gathering for the son of the armour and company but he did not choose the rest of the sisters he chose that little lady that walked out and was carrying the wash water that walked out there barefooted before him I see humbled herself and he's seen a character on the inside of her on the inside of her that he could trust they other sisters he did not see that character in but he's seen in this lady of grace we slipped the wedding band of unmerited grace upon you before the foundation of the world he had confidence in your character throughout the whole year she was preparing for his coming life went on critics passed by sisters passed by skepticism passed by but she was trusting she was believing because he made a promise to her that where I am you will be also and on this day from a year from now I'm coming for you and she made herself ready she saved up all of her energies and she studied on that stored up food and she made herself ready and the Prophet said that she has the material on earth now to make herself ready and this little bride has made herself ready and on that day she steps out from that door she takes off the apron for the last time she stops washing dishes for the last time she stops cleaning for the last time and she walks out goes into a room gets the clothes and there's her wedding dress and she puts the wedding dress home that is spotless who that makes her pure that shows that there's no blemish on her and she walks out and the rest of the world is making front of this little bride and she steps out on the patio and she walks down the walkway and she goes by the gate and all of a sudden the Sun comes and he picks her up he's got trust in you little bra he's got trust in you may the musicians come psalms 125 and verse 1 they that trust in the lord shall be as a mount design which cannot be removed but about it forever as the mountains are round about Jerusalem so the Lord is round about us people from hits forth even forever we will trust in him forever for in him his everlasting strength maybe we could sing that song through it all I've learned

a never before into his heavenly kingdom may our faith rise may our faith SOI to the things that he has in store for us and he'll use us like never before and we'll watch the promises of God become very clear and manifested before our eyes we've rounded the M&E we were out of the enemy and it's our time to chase him down chase him down my praying chase him down by seeking the Lord chase him down
