[45:39] [Music]
[45:45] I know the master of
[45:52] Let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[45:53] tonight. Heavenly Father, we come before
[45:56] you,
[45:58] Lord, and we're so thankful, Father, to
[46:00] realize that you're in the boat of our
[46:02] life, Lord Jesus, to just to sense the
[46:05] nearness of your holy presence, Lord. No
[46:08] matter if you're out there walking on
[46:10] the water or if you're in our boat, we
[46:12] know, Father, that you are in control of
[46:14] all things. Father, we just want to
[46:17] completely yield ourselves over to you,
[46:19] Father. Lord, that you could just bless
[46:21] us tonight, both hearer and speaker.
[46:23] Father alike, Lord, that your presence
[46:26] would come down and begin to minister
[46:27] unto us, Lord, through the message of
[46:30] the hour, Father. Our hearts have been
[46:32] turned, Lord, and the veil has been
[46:34] taken away, Father, and we see Jesus,
[46:36] Lord. We are so thankful, Father, that
[46:39] we don't look at this message and see
[46:41] books and tapes and just rules, Father,
[46:43] but we see the living Jesus Christ. And
[46:46] Lord, I just want to thank you for the
[46:48] message of the hour. I want to thank you
[46:50] for coming by my way, Lord. Even when it
[46:53] looked like you you shouldn't have, but
[46:55] Father, your your election, Father,
[46:57] chose me, Father. And I'm so thankful,
[47:00] Lord, tonight, Lord, to be gathered here
[47:02] in a body of believers, Lord, that
[47:04] believe this message is going to rapture
[47:06] their soul. And I pray that tonight that
[47:09] you would minister unto them, Lord,
[47:11] through the preaching of the word. There
[47:12] are many needs here, Lord, God, that
[47:14] have been presented to you. And we ask,
[47:16] God, that you would just make yourself
[47:18] known. May the abiding Jesus Christ come
[47:21] amongst us tonight, walk the aisles and
[47:24] sit with us in the pews, Father. Lord,
[47:26] we open up our heart just now and ask
[47:28] that the King of Kings would come, Lord,
[47:31] and visit with us just a little bit in
[47:33] the name of Jesus Christ. We pray these
[47:35] things. Amen. And amen. If you have your
[47:38] Bibles today, we'd like to look over in
[47:41] the book of Hebrews chapter 7 and
[47:43] Hebrews chapter 10.
[47:47] Man,
[47:51] man, we're certainly looking unto the
[47:52] Lord this weekend and just believing for
[47:56] a just a supernatural charge of the Holy
[47:58] Spirit before we go into these Labor Day
[48:01] meetings. We're so thankful that we're
[48:02] able to have them again this year. We
[48:05] don't take meetings for grants, but it's
[48:07] a time, a refreshing from the Lord, and
[48:09] we're asking that God would just come
[48:11] amongst us in a very special way. And I
[48:14] believe he's going to. Don't you? Amen.
[48:17] Amen. We're going to welcome our brother
[48:19] Jonathan Frey and his family here with
[48:20] us this this evening. He's a good friend
[48:22] to me and I get a note from him about
[48:25] every week. He sends me what he's
[48:26] smoking. It ain't it ain't what you're
[48:28] thinking. He's smoking different meats
[48:30] and different things and and uh he he
[48:33] knows how to make a guy jealous and he
[48:35] made us up some some beef jerky while we
[48:38] was there in Canada and it was it was
[48:40] exceptional. And I don't mind being a
[48:42] guinea pig for things like that. So just
[48:45] remember me.
[48:48] Ice cream,
[48:50] ham sandwiches,
[48:52] beef jerky,
[48:54] and the message of the hour.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; That's my diet right there. Amen. Amen.
[49:01] I'd like to just read this quote uh to
[49:03] you uh before we before we go into the
[49:06] the reading of the word this evening.
[49:08] Brother Brandham said in the true Easter
[49:09] Seal, and I think it's beautiful, and
[49:11] brother Brandham says these things right
[49:12] here. He said, "You just see if he's
[49:15] still the high priest that can be
[49:16] touched by the feeling of your
[49:18] infirmity." He said, "I never seen you
[49:20] in my life. You're a stranger to me. I I
[49:22] know nothing about you. God does know
[49:25] you. And if he can reveal to me by his
[49:27] Holy Spirit, the resurrected Christ who
[49:29] come here and give me a temporarily
[49:32] resurrection by my spirit that my spirit
[49:35] goes away now and his spirit comes in
[49:38] then to let you know whether he is alive
[49:40] or not. Now I don't know you. That's me,
[49:43] my spirit. We don't know you, but he
[49:45] knows you. But he wants to borrow my
[49:48] body to prove that he's the resurrected
[49:51] Christ. I'm so happy to loan it to him,
[49:54] give it to him, anything that he can get
[49:57] out of it. Hebrews chapter 7 and verse
[50:00] one. For this Melzdc, king of Salem,
[50:04] priest of the most high, who met
[50:06] Abraham, returning from the slaughter of
[50:07] the kings, and blessed him, to whom also
[50:10] Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first
[50:13] being by interpretation king of
[50:16] righteousness, and after that the king
[50:17] of Salem, which is king of peace,
[50:20] without father, without mother, without
[50:22] dissent, having neither beginning of
[50:24] days, nor end of life, but made like
[50:27] unto the Son of God, abideth a priest
[50:30] continually. ually Hebrews chapter 10
[50:33] and verse 5.
[50:40] Wherefore when he cometh into the world,
[50:42] he saith, sacrifice and offering thou
[50:46] wouldest not, but a body hast thou
[50:49] prepared me? May God bless his word. You
[50:51] may be seated tonight here in the
[50:53] presence of the Lord. I'd like to just
[50:54] carry on our thought from last weekend
[50:56] and what the Lord's been just laboring
[50:58] on my heart on a borrowed body. And we
[51:01] we recognize that that by the the quote
[51:04] that we've read, we recognize
[51:06] immediately and we're so thankful that
[51:08] we don't have to guess at what the
[51:09] message of the hour is saying unto us.
[51:11] But we recognize exactly who this is
[51:13] right here amongst us. And we we can
[51:15] look clearly at it. You don't have to
[51:17] guess who it is, but you know exactly
[51:19] who it is that is coming down and has
[51:21] been ministering unto us and been
[51:23] feeding our souls. And we realize that
[51:25] MelzDC is none other than God Almighty
[51:28] manifest in a in a theophony body. And
[51:31] we realize that the Bible begins to
[51:33] assert to us here that Melzdc is the
[51:36] king of Salem. He is he is the king and
[51:38] priest of the most high God. And you
[51:40] begin to see Melzdc step into the
[51:42] picture in in Genesis chapter 14 when he
[51:45] comes down there after Abraham fights
[51:48] for his brother-in-law Lot or his his
[51:50] nephew there. He begins to fight for him
[51:52] and Melzdc shows up after the battle is
[51:55] over. And that's where I think that we
[51:57] ought to draw our attention is that when
[52:00] Melzdc shows up, it is there at a
[52:02] season. And when Melzdc ever shows up,
[52:04] it is a for a time and a season for
[52:07] recreation. And you begin to watch that
[52:09] MelzDC shows up after the battle is
[52:12] over. And we realize that by the by the
[52:15] scripture that this that this MelzDC was
[52:18] none other than Jehovah himself. He was
[52:21] the most high God. He was he was the
[52:23] great I am. He was alpha and omega. He
[52:26] was the root and offspring of David. He
[52:29] is the rose of Sharon. And he is the
[52:31] lily of the valley. He is none other
[52:34] than the self-abiding almighty God
[52:36] himself. We could say it like this. It
[52:38] was the logos before it took on flesh.
[52:42] This Melzdc is the word. And Paul when
[52:45] he brings in the argument here in in
[52:48] Hebrews chapter 7, he begins to lay out
[52:50] some fundamental things and highlights
[52:52] the insufficiencies when you begin to
[52:54] read Hebrews 6 and 7 and 8 and go
[52:57] through there that Paul begins to
[52:58] highlight the insufficiencies
[53:01] of the law or the Levitical priesthood
[53:03] that they had completely based their
[53:06] their priesthood strictly upon forms and
[53:08] and religions and carnal laws and
[53:11] shadows that could never believe. bring
[53:13] bring the believer into a place of
[53:16] complete redemption. Though they would
[53:18] come to a place where they would feel
[53:20] where they would feel under the word of
[53:22] God and there would be anointing there
[53:24] and there would be a powerful presence
[53:26] there. But we recognize by the
[53:28] scriptures that the Levitical priesthood
[53:31] was going to come to an end because God
[53:33] was laying it in there that it could
[53:35] only go so far. If you look at verse 11
[53:38] in Hebrews 7, it said, "Therefore
[53:40] perfection were if if if per therefore
[53:43] if perfection were by the Levitical
[53:45] priesthood, for under it the people
[53:48] received the law." He said, "But what
[53:50] nor need what further need was there
[53:52] that another priest should rise after
[53:54] the order of Melzdc and not be called
[53:57] after the order of Aaron?" So if Aaron's
[54:00] priesthood, if it's power, if it had the
[54:02] power and the ability to wash the
[54:05] believer and make him clean, then there
[54:07] was no need for Jesus to be able to come
[54:09] here as a complete sacrifice. But that's
[54:12] why Paul is laying in there. They
[54:15] showing that the Levitical priesthood
[54:17] could only take you so far. That the
[54:19] aeronic priesthood could only wash you.
[54:22] It could simply cover up your skin. It
[54:24] could cover up your anointing. It could
[54:26] cover up your of your of your DNA. It
[54:29] could cover up your sins. It could cover
[54:30] up your mistakes, but it couldn't
[54:32] completely eradicate them. Notice what
[54:35] verse 19 says that the law made nothing
[54:38] perfect. Now, we know that if we're
[54:41] going to if we if we're going to enter
[54:43] into that beautiful city, then we've got
[54:45] to be made perfect. We've got to be made
[54:47] whole. And we realize that the blood of
[54:50] bulls and goats could not make the
[54:52] worshipper therefore unto perfect. the
[54:55] law made nothing perfect but the
[54:57] bringing in of a better hope did and
[55:01] that's what Melazdc this priesthood was
[55:03] doing that by the witch he drew nigh we
[55:07] draw nigh unto God so Aaron would come
[55:10] in and you can imagine as he is elected
[55:13] to this priesthood he would come in and
[55:15] he would see thousands of of sacrifices
[55:18] now that they would come in the
[55:20] worshipper would come in you can imagine
[55:22] the mindset of the high priest and is
[55:24] there and he's operating under his
[55:27] priestly duties and he begins to watch
[55:29] them as they're coming over the hill and
[55:32] they're bringing that perfect that
[55:34] perfect sacrifice that doesn't have
[55:36] blemish. It doesn't have a mar on it.
[55:38] They've studied it out and everything's
[55:40] got to be in its perfection. But you can
[55:42] imagine as Aaron as he's standing there,
[55:46] he can look at all of those lambs and
[55:48] those rams and everything coming there.
[55:50] But could you imagine Aaron knowing that
[55:53] all of those priests, all of those
[55:55] sacrifices would never make them
[55:58] perfect?
[55:59] &gt;&gt; That it would never eradicate them. That
[56:01] the worshipper, yes, he was worshiping
[56:04] in God's chosen place, but he was not
[56:07] completely eradicated. His conscience
[56:10] was not clear. He went in there and he
[56:13] never was made clean,
[56:14] &gt;&gt; but he was operating according to God's
[56:16] law. So, he did everything. And
[56:19] therefore, God accepted his sacrifice.
[56:22] But Aaron was looking for something. The
[56:25] priesthood was looking for something.
[56:28] I'll be honest. I don't want to come to
[56:30] church and live the same way that I am.
[56:33] I want it to come here and I want him to
[56:37] perfect me by the word.
[56:41] But Aaron knows
[56:43] that all of them worshippers, no matter
[56:46] how many millions of bloods of bulls and
[56:49] goats, could never make the worshipper
[56:52] therefore clean. Notice notice what it
[56:55] says in Hebrews 10:1 that the law having
[56:58] a shadow of good things to come and not
[57:01] the very image of the things can never
[57:04] with those sacrifices which they offered
[57:06] year by year continually make the comers
[57:08] there unto perfect. So they walked in
[57:12] there, they came in there with their
[57:14] sins and their petitions. They left
[57:16] there forgiven for the moment
[57:19] &gt;&gt; but they never changed.
[57:22] Now, to be a real worshiper,
[57:24] you've got to have a change.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. You've got to have a
[57:30] real change. It's not you that you don't
[57:33] cut your hair. It's not that you wear
[57:36] long dresses and your brothers don't act
[57:38] like sissies. What makes a worshipper is
[57:41] the change that comes upon his heart.
[57:44] Because anybody can praise, anybody can
[57:47] shout, anybody can sing. But God wants a
[57:50] worshipper that is perfected by the
[57:54] blood of Jesus Christ.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Never changed.
[58:03] But I love what verse 12 says in chapter
[58:08] 10. But this man,
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This man, this man after he
[58:16] had offered one sacrifice for sins,
[58:19] forever sat down on the right hand of
[58:22] God from henceforth accepting till his
[58:25] enemies be made his foottool. For by one
[58:28] offering,
[58:32] &gt;&gt; come on, Catholics.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Where you got to constantly beat
[58:36] yourself. You don't need nobody.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; You don't need another lamb. You don't
[58:42] need a red heer.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; This one sacrifice forever.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Perfected forever. Them that are
[58:53] sanctified.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? Satan,
[58:58] &gt;&gt; do you hear me? Demons of hell, this
[59:01] man's sacrifice,
[59:04] &gt;&gt; this man's death
[59:06] made me perfect.
[59:12] Somebody give God praise.
[59:20] So the law, it's kind of like a man that
[59:24] would go to the doctor and he's got a
[59:27] wound on his body and he's constantly
[59:29] got an infection is affect an infection
[59:31] there and he could go to the doctor,
[59:33] brother Doug, the doctor could place a
[59:35] bandage or a band-aid over top of that
[59:37] wound
[59:39] and he could go in there the next day
[59:41] and the wound would still be there and
[59:43] he would replace the band-aid. He would
[59:45] go in there again and it could do the
[59:48] same exact thing. But the band-aid does
[59:50] never get rid of the infection.
[59:52] It's just covering it up. And that's
[59:55] what Aaron's priesthood was. It was
[59:57] simply covering up the infection. But
[1:00:00] this Jesus
[1:00:02] was the cure. It was the antibiotic
[1:00:06] to make our blood clean.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Notice what Paul says in Hebrews 7:15.
[1:00:13] And it is yet far more evident for that
[1:00:17] after the similitude of Melzdc there
[1:00:20] ariseth
[1:00:21] another priest.
[1:00:24] Now let me tell you this. If Jesus don't
[1:00:27] get up out of the grave,
[1:00:30] if Jesus doesn't rise up, if Jesus
[1:00:33] doesn't get up out of the grave, if
[1:00:35] Jesus doesn't pay the debt, then you and
[1:00:38] I are not perfect.
[1:00:42] Now there's a lot of people even
[1:00:44] Pharisees and Sadducees even fought over
[1:00:46] this that there was no resurrection
[1:00:50] and there are people even today that say
[1:00:52] there is no resurrection. But let me say
[1:00:55] this without Jesus rising up then there
[1:00:59] is nobody that can be made perfect.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; But because there was a priest made
[1:01:05] after the similitude of Mazdc.
[1:01:09] Hallelujah. Who is made not after the
[1:01:12] law of a carnal commandment, but after
[1:01:16] the power
[1:01:19] of an endless
[1:01:22] life.
[1:01:26] Endless
[1:01:30] I know we got some farmers in here.
[1:01:35] You've had to you've had to butcher some
[1:01:38] things.
[1:01:39] But once you took his life,
[1:01:42] it was over.
[1:01:45] It didn't matter if you loved
[1:01:48] Billy or not. He wasn't coming back.
[1:01:54] It did not matter about Barabus's
[1:01:58] perfect lamb.
[1:02:00] His lamb was his seeing eyes to be able
[1:02:03] to take him through the streets to be
[1:02:05] able to lead him around. But he could go
[1:02:08] up there and offer it, but he can never
[1:02:10] get his sacrifice back. Hallelujah.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; But this one that was going to walk by
[1:02:17] Barabus
[1:02:19] one time would change his life,
[1:02:23] this lamb, this powerhouse would lead
[1:02:27] him the rest of the days of his life. An
[1:02:30] endless
[1:02:32] endless life.
[1:02:35] Woo.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; What does it when you begin to see Paul
[1:02:38] as he begins to illustrate and perfect
[1:02:41] perfectly comes in there and labors on
[1:02:43] the thought of who this MelzDC is, he
[1:02:47] shows us that there is a change in
[1:02:49] dispensations. That this priesthood is a
[1:02:53] priesthood of an endless life. That when
[1:02:55] you see Melazdc show up, as I said, it
[1:02:58] is about new creation that is getting
[1:03:00] ready to start. When he showed up to
[1:03:02] Abraham, it was about new creation. When
[1:03:05] he showed up to Joshua, it was about new
[1:03:07] creation. When he showed up to Jacob,
[1:03:10] when he was wrestling with Melzdc down
[1:03:12] there,
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; what did he do? It was about new
[1:03:17] creation because Jacob was no longer
[1:03:19] going to be Jacob no more.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; But he's going to be known as Israel, a
[1:03:26] prince with power.
[1:03:33] Hallelujah. What are you saying, brother
[1:03:35] Angel? I'm saying that when Melzdc comes
[1:03:37] to your life, it's about the token. It's
[1:03:41] about a complete nature change. When
[1:03:43] Melzdc shows up, it's about the new
[1:03:45] birth. And you might have been birthed
[1:03:47] here and you come in here speaking lies
[1:03:50] and all kinds of carnal forms about you.
[1:03:53] But when this Melchazdc, when this new
[1:03:55] birth, when you are washed, baptized,
[1:03:58] justified, sanctified, and filled with
[1:04:01] the Holy Ghost, when this Melzdc shows
[1:04:03] up, he creates in you a new image, a new
[1:04:07] desire, a new life. What is it? It's the
[1:04:10] son of man looking for a dwelling place.
[1:04:13] A body.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; A body.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; He can borrow.
[1:04:26] Hallelujah.
[1:04:28] That's Melzdc.
[1:04:30] There's been great
[1:04:33] theologians that have never figured out
[1:04:35] who he is.
[1:04:37] There's been a lot of studies done on
[1:04:38] Melkazedc. I go back and read them every
[1:04:41] once in a while for a good laugh to see
[1:04:43] how wrong they are. But they've guessed
[1:04:45] at it. They've probed at it. They
[1:04:47] presumed at it and they said, "Well,
[1:04:49] it's just a priesthood." But the Bible
[1:04:51] said that Melzdc was a person that he
[1:04:54] was the king of Salem. And if you're a
[1:04:57] king, that means you got to have a
[1:04:59] domain. He was a king of peace. He was
[1:05:02] the king of righteousness. So therefore,
[1:05:04] it could not have been Hallelujah. It
[1:05:06] could not have been a lesser God or a
[1:05:08] weaker God, but it had to be one person.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; He was without father. He was without
[1:05:14] mothers without beginning and end. He
[1:05:16] was none other than Jehovah manifested
[1:05:19] by creation. The same one that visited
[1:05:22] Abraham, the pre-incarnate Jesus Christ.
[1:05:25] What are you saying, brother Andrew? I'm
[1:05:27] saying it was the dove that led the lamb
[1:05:31] to the cross.
[1:05:33] This MelzDC is a dove of the Holy Spirit
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; that comes to the believer's hearts.
[1:05:40] That gives you power to resurrect. It
[1:05:44] gives you power to be made whole. It
[1:05:47] gives you power
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; to recognize that the same one
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; that John was watching.
[1:06:03] John's a type of you.
[1:06:07] And all of a sudden he sees one stand up
[1:06:11] and start walking
[1:06:13] through the Ephesian age.
[1:06:18] through the Samra age, through the
[1:06:20] Thyaran age, through the Ephesian age,
[1:06:23] through the Philadelphiaian age, and
[1:06:26] then he sees him walking right there in
[1:06:27] Leosa. What are you saying? I'm saying
[1:06:30] he's the same one.
[1:06:33] I'm saying that that was that same
[1:06:34] MelzDC that was back there in the Garden
[1:06:38] of Eden. It's the same Melzdc that is
[1:06:41] right here in Satan's Eden. and he's
[1:06:43] going to make sure that this body will
[1:06:45] not fall like he fail. Hallelujah. You
[1:06:47] don't have to count on your flesh. You
[1:06:49] don't have to count on your pastor. You
[1:06:51] don't have to count on some deacon to
[1:06:53] keep you in line. This MelzDC,
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; this MelzDC has showed up to make sure
[1:07:01] you make it. This Melzdc has showed up.
[1:07:13] He was the one that fulfilled Hebrews
[1:07:17] 8:3.
[1:07:18] For every high priest is ordained to
[1:07:21] offer gifts and sacrifices. Wherefore it
[1:07:23] is of necessity
[1:07:26] that this man have someone also to
[1:07:29] offer.
[1:07:31] Notice what Paul tells us that this
[1:07:34] Melzdc
[1:07:36] is a priesthood of more and better. When
[1:07:40] you study the book of Hebrews, you'll
[1:07:42] find the very common language of more
[1:07:44] and better. And I find this about my
[1:07:47] Melzdc that every time he shows up, I
[1:07:50] get some more. And every time he walks
[1:07:53] in the door, things get a little bit
[1:07:55] better.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Why? because he's a priest of more and
[1:08:00] better. But I tell you what this Melzdc
[1:08:03] will do. This Melzdc said that in this
[1:08:07] hour that I will put my law in their
[1:08:10] minds and in their hearts.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Now I starting to get out of it when I
[1:08:20] was in school,
[1:08:24] but I didn't get out of it when I got
[1:08:25] home. But they used to paddle you, smack
[1:08:30] you on the hand when you wasn't getting
[1:08:31] in line with everything.
[1:08:35] You wasn't listening.
[1:08:37] How many in here wants to show their age
[1:08:39] when they had a had a ruler slapped
[1:08:41] across their hand? When they wasn't
[1:08:42] paying attention, when they wasn't doing
[1:08:44] what the teacher said. Now, there's a
[1:08:46] few of you in here.
[1:08:49] Be careful.
[1:08:51] But when you wasn't picking down what
[1:08:54] she was putting up, putting down, you
[1:08:55] wasn't picking it up, and all of a
[1:08:57] sudden, she comes over, smacks you on
[1:08:59] the hand because you wasn't doing
[1:09:00] exactly the way the teacher said.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; What I love about this teacher, the
[1:09:05] tutor of the Holy Ghost, he's he's never
[1:09:08] had to smack me on the hand. He's now
[1:09:11] he's had to whoop me a few times, but
[1:09:12] he's never never had to come in there
[1:09:15] and say, "You know what? You're writing
[1:09:17] it down wrong. You're you're looking at
[1:09:18] it wrong." Why? Because the Melzdc, the
[1:09:22] same one that wrote the word is the same
[1:09:25] one that lives in my heart is the same
[1:09:28] one.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus said that they that worship
[1:09:32] him have got to worship him in spirit
[1:09:35] and in truth.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; And Jesus, the Bible tells us that God
[1:09:40] is a spirit. And if you are a spirit,
[1:09:43] whether you're a holy spirit or an evil
[1:09:45] spirit, then you've got to have a body
[1:09:48] to be able to work through. So God is
[1:09:51] looking for empty vessels that he could
[1:09:54] pour himself into and therefore
[1:09:57] hallelujah and shake the world with it.
[1:10:00] That's right.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Just like when you start studying these
[1:10:05] big old giants that come in, how they
[1:10:08] come in from the Garden of Eden through
[1:10:10] the serpent seed. What was it? Lucifer
[1:10:14] was looking for a body that he could
[1:10:17] borrow that he could come in. He could
[1:10:20] take that body. He could manipulate that
[1:10:22] body. He could come in there and he
[1:10:25] could lay seed and it could go forth, go
[1:10:28] through the bedding ground of Eve,
[1:10:30] therefore bringing forth serpent seed.
[1:10:32] But before Lucifer could do this, he had
[1:10:35] to have a body that he could operate in.
[1:10:38] Let me say this that Jesus needs your
[1:10:42] body.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus needs your life. the evil spirit
[1:10:47] that was cast out of the swine and the
[1:10:50] hog up there on at that maniac. They
[1:10:53] needed a body to be able to operate in.
[1:10:57] And when Jesus cast that evil spirit out
[1:10:59] of Legion, they said, "Send us into that
[1:11:02] herd of swine because they need a body
[1:11:05] to work through." You remember when King
[1:11:07] Saul lost his anointing that there all
[1:11:10] of a sudden an evil spirit become to
[1:11:13] work on him, he was he was influenced by
[1:11:16] an evil spirit. Why? Because a spirit
[1:11:19] has got to have a body to work through.
[1:11:22] You remember when there's a king up
[1:11:23] there and he's wanting to know whether
[1:11:25] he should go out to battle or whether
[1:11:27] they're going to win the battle or not.
[1:11:29] And there he brought up these false
[1:11:32] prophets that was going to tell him he
[1:11:34] was going to win. But remember what the
[1:11:36] scripture said is that the aligned
[1:11:39] spirit, hallelujah, got on the inside of
[1:11:42] them false prophets and all of a sudden
[1:11:44] they begin to speak things that was
[1:11:47] going to take place.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; But there was somebody in the crowd that
[1:11:52] said, "Is there one more?
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; One that is led by the true spirit?"
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Because a spirit needs a body to work
[1:12:04] through. So it took 400 prophets and
[1:12:07] begin to work through it.
[1:12:13] When you look at Jesus as he's coming
[1:12:14] down, he chooses a very select class of
[1:12:17] people.
[1:12:23] Here's Judas that's walking with him.
[1:12:28] I'm always astonished at Luke 22.
[1:12:32] Now you begin to see
[1:12:34] that there's some conniving that is
[1:12:36] going on
[1:12:38] because a spirit needs a body.
[1:12:42] Notice this spirit starts working on
[1:12:45] these high priest working on these
[1:12:47] soldiers
[1:12:49] and they was looking for an angle
[1:12:52] to get Jesus
[1:12:54] was looking for it. And the Bible then
[1:12:57] said, "Then
[1:13:01] Satan entered Judas."
[1:13:03] You see the angle had been presented and
[1:13:07] then the spirit came. You look at it in
[1:13:10] this hour that is exactly what has tried
[1:13:12] to take place. An evil spirit has tried
[1:13:14] to come in. The enemy brought in an
[1:13:17] angle and all of a sudden the spirit got
[1:13:19] behind it and tried to thwart and kill.
[1:13:24] It ain't them people.
[1:13:27] It's a spirit.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Remember what the prophet told us that
[1:13:31] God takes his man but never his spirit.
[1:13:35] And so does Satan take his man but never
[1:13:39] his spirit. He said now when they asked
[1:13:41] him the question and question answers
[1:13:43] said where is him evil spirits that was
[1:13:45] in that maniac? Brother Brandham said
[1:13:47] they're still here today.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; He said they're still here today. He
[1:13:50] said, "Whenever you come into contact
[1:13:52] with an an insane individual," he said,
[1:13:55] "they're real crippled up." He said,
[1:13:56] "They've got great strong power." He
[1:13:59] said, "What is it?" He said, "It's not
[1:14:00] them people." He said, "But it's a
[1:14:02] spirit that's on them that gives them
[1:14:04] the power to be able to throw people."
[1:14:06] You remember when brother Brandon was
[1:14:08] going down there in that little that
[1:14:09] little room and that little woman down
[1:14:11] there was slipping around like a snake.
[1:14:13] What was it? It wasn't that woman, but
[1:14:15] it was a spirit that was on that woman.
[1:14:17] He was simply borrowing her body. And
[1:14:19] you remember what the spirit began to
[1:14:21] cry out? Said, "William Brown, you had
[1:14:23] nothing to do with me. I brought her
[1:14:25] here."
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; You remember what that husband said,
[1:14:29] "Now look said, she ain't spoken so many
[1:14:32] so many months in so many years." He
[1:14:34] said, "It's not her." He said, "It's
[1:14:36] that spirit in her. That's a devil in
[1:14:38] her. It's making her do those things."
[1:14:40] What was it?
[1:14:42] That spirit needed a body to be able to
[1:14:45] operate in. You notice when you ever you
[1:14:47] ever been around somebody that's been
[1:14:49] out of their mind and mental case,
[1:14:51] they're very strong. They have
[1:14:53] superpower. You're going to grab them by
[1:14:55] the hand, they'll jerk your shoulder
[1:14:56] right off of you. They've got a
[1:14:58] superpower. I love what Brother Man said
[1:15:00] this. He said, "Now, if the devil can
[1:15:03] give a crippled person or an insane
[1:15:05] person that kind of a power, what would
[1:15:07] the Holy Ghost do if he got on the
[1:15:10] inside of an individual that if he could
[1:15:12] give somebody that is crippled up or
[1:15:14] sick that kind of a power?" I say it
[1:15:17] like this. What did he do in Samson?
[1:15:19] What did he do in David? What did he do
[1:15:21] in the three boys? What was it? It was a
[1:15:24] spirit
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; that used Samson's body, that used
[1:15:28] David's body, that used Daniel's body,
[1:15:31] that used Shadrach, Meshack, and
[1:15:33] Abednego's body because God wanted to
[1:15:36] borrow
[1:15:38] a body.
[1:15:44] You watch brother Brandham when he
[1:15:47] starts talking about that lady.
[1:15:51] Brother Brandham said I found this
[1:15:53] amazing is that because brother Brandham
[1:15:56] said now he said the ministry had not
[1:15:58] come into the discerning of hearts yet.
[1:16:00] It was simply laying on the hands and he
[1:16:02] said I had to take the patient by the
[1:16:03] hand to be able to tell what the disease
[1:16:06] was. And he said I wretch over there to
[1:16:07] try to grab a hold of her. He said but I
[1:16:09] couldn't do it. He said, "And the man,
[1:16:13] her husband began to get so distraught
[1:16:16] because he couldn't lay his hand on
[1:16:18] her."
[1:16:20] Brother Mar, I love this. Brother Mar
[1:16:22] said,
[1:16:24] "What about that gift?" He said, "I can
[1:16:27] right now ask God in heaven to touch
[1:16:30] her."
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to lay hands on her. All
[1:16:34] of a sudden, he began to pray because
[1:16:37] God needs a body that knows how to pray.
[1:16:41] Whether you got a gift, whether you can
[1:16:43] shout, whether you can sing, whether
[1:16:45] you've got a gift of knowledge, he wants
[1:16:48] somebody
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; that can pray.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:02] One man said this
[1:17:07] because they'd heard there was a family
[1:17:10] that heard about this case.
[1:17:15] He said it was a case of menopause
[1:17:19] that had got on this woman.
[1:17:23] Menopause, whether you recognize it or
[1:17:25] not, is a spirit.
[1:17:28] And he said all of a sudden he said a
[1:17:29] doctor gave her a shot for that
[1:17:31] menopause and it made her start losing
[1:17:34] her mind.
[1:17:39] This individual comes to brother Brandon
[1:17:41] said he said I've sold my donkey. He
[1:17:43] said I've sold my farm. He said I've
[1:17:45] sold everything.
[1:17:47] He said but I heard about that little
[1:17:48] woman
[1:17:50] how that God delivered her. He said if
[1:17:53] he'll do it for her he can do it for my
[1:17:55] wife. You see what the power of one
[1:17:59] testimony.
[1:18:02] You may not like
[1:18:04] going through the trials of your life.
[1:18:06] You may not like going through the
[1:18:08] troubles and the stormy seas and the and
[1:18:10] the ups and the downs of it all. But let
[1:18:13] me say this. God used a woman that was
[1:18:17] in a state of menopause and he borrowed
[1:18:20] her body to bring about deliverance.
[1:18:29] What did sister Mariah Puit her
[1:18:31] testimony do? It gave us the ability to
[1:18:35] recognize that God can borrow a little
[1:18:37] girl's body and he can put hair back on
[1:18:39] her head. And we've got a living
[1:18:41] testimony in the house of God tonight.
[1:18:44] That God again wants to borrow a body to
[1:18:48] restore his glory. What happened with
[1:18:51] Sister Elena Buts? It was God showing
[1:18:53] that he wanted to borrow a body
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; that was greater than cancer of the
[1:18:59] lung.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; What did he use brother Ron for? He
[1:19:05] wanted to borrow a body. But God don't
[1:19:08] want to stop there. God wants some
[1:19:10] teenagers. God wants some little bitty
[1:19:12] girls. God wants some young men.
[1:19:16] Somebody that'll worship him in spirit
[1:19:19] and in truth in the good times. I'll
[1:19:22] praise him in the bad times. I'll praise
[1:19:24] him on the mountains. I'll praise him.
[1:19:31] You remember
[1:19:34] there's a little bit of girl that God
[1:19:36] wants to borrow her body.
[1:19:39] She's kept herself.
[1:19:44] God wants to borrow a little 16-year-old
[1:19:46] girl
[1:19:48] because
[1:19:50] he needed a teenage girl that he could
[1:19:54] place his seat in.
[1:19:58] Mary may not have understood
[1:20:00] what she was fully accepting,
[1:20:04] but she was getting ready to bring
[1:20:05] salvation to you.
[1:20:12] I always ask the question, what if?
[1:20:15] What if she wouldn't have let him borrow
[1:20:17] her body?
[1:20:19] What would have happened to the story of
[1:20:21] salvation? What if you won't let God use
[1:20:24] your body? What if you won't completely
[1:20:27] yield yourself over it? But God wanted
[1:20:30] to borrow a 16-year-old little girl's
[1:20:33] body to be able to bring forth the
[1:20:35] savior of the whole world. And therefore
[1:20:38] she be to say testify whether somebody
[1:20:41] believed her or not. She was testifying
[1:20:44] that she met an angel that was going to
[1:20:47] bring forth this angel prophesied that
[1:20:49] she was going to bring forth a son and
[1:20:51] he was going to call his name Jesus and
[1:20:54] he was going to be the savior of the
[1:20:56] whole world.
[1:20:58] But when Mary and Joseph and Jesus go up
[1:21:01] at the feast of Passover, when he's 12
[1:21:04] years old and he's up there testifying
[1:21:06] and preaching to the scribes and the
[1:21:08] Pharisees,
[1:21:09] Mary comes up there. Mary comes up there
[1:21:12] and she begins to deny the supernatural
[1:21:15] birth that takes place. Said, "I and
[1:21:17] your father have sought you for three
[1:21:19] days." But Jesus looks at her and said,
[1:21:22] "Look, I've got to be about my father's
[1:21:26] business."
[1:21:27] Jesus never did anything without the
[1:21:30] father's permission.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; She was denying
[1:21:36] the supernatural birth.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; But I want to say this to you. He's a
[1:21:41] God of first chances. He's a God of
[1:21:43] second chances. He's a God of third
[1:21:45] chances. He's a God of fourth chances.
[1:21:47] You say, "Well, Brother Andrew, you
[1:21:49] don't know what I've been through and
[1:21:50] you don't know how I failed God." God is
[1:21:53] a kind of God that'll give you another
[1:21:56] chance. And she denied the supernatural
[1:21:58] birth. But on the day of Pentecost, God
[1:22:02] wanted to borrow Mary's body again.
[1:22:10] Hallelujah.
[1:22:12] I love what brother Brandon said in the
[1:22:14] adoption series. He said, "He was the
[1:22:17] all existence."
[1:22:20] He was the all existence. There ever was
[1:22:22] self-existing one. Elah Elohim means
[1:22:25] that all sufficient, all powerful,
[1:22:27] almighty, self-existing one. He said,
[1:22:30] but in Genesis chapter 2, when he made a
[1:22:32] man, he said, I am Jehovah. What did it
[1:22:36] mean? It meant that I am the allexistent
[1:22:39] one who was and has created something
[1:22:42] off of myself to be a son of mine or a
[1:22:47] temporary or an amateur little one.
[1:22:49] Mine. Oh glory. Why? When he gave man,
[1:22:53] Jehovah means that he gave man to be an
[1:22:56] amateur god. Jehovah means that he gave
[1:23:01] man to be an amateur god because he is
[1:23:04] father god and he made an amateur god.
[1:23:07] So he isn't self-existing anymore. He
[1:23:10] exists
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; with his family.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Elah Elohim. Now he is Jehovah, meaning
[1:23:18] the one who exists with his family.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; What are you saying, brother Andrew? I'm
[1:23:27] saying Paul said it correct when he said
[1:23:29] in Hebrews chapter 2, for both he that
[1:23:32] sanctifith and they who are sanctified
[1:23:34] are all of one. He said, don't you see,
[1:23:37] brother Bam said, don't you see the vine
[1:23:39] and the branch together that they're all
[1:23:41] one? for which cause he is not ashamed
[1:23:45] to call them brethren.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna preach right now.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Including every mistake. He is not
[1:23:56] ashamed to call you brethren. Include
[1:23:59] including every one of your trials. He
[1:24:01] is not ashamed to call you brethren.
[1:24:04] Including every bit of your troubles. He
[1:24:06] is not ashamed to call you brethren.
[1:24:09] including everything bad in your DNA and
[1:24:12] your family history. He is not ashamed
[1:24:15] to call you brethren.
[1:24:18] You say, "Well, I'm a black sheep in my
[1:24:20] family." Let me say, there is no misfits
[1:24:22] in God's family. There is no bad apples
[1:24:25] in God's family.
[1:24:28] [Applause]
[1:24:32] He isn't ashamed.
[1:24:36] He is not ashamed.
[1:24:41] of you.
[1:24:58] You see, that's what he wanted to prove
[1:25:00] to Abraham.
[1:25:02] He was a God
[1:25:04] who restores.
[1:25:08] He was a God that makes brand new.
[1:25:12] He was the God.
[1:25:20] Hallelujah.
[1:25:24] You imagine Abraham.
[1:25:27] He's went through the worst of times.
[1:25:31] Let me tell you, if anybody can talk to
[1:25:34] you about cycles of life, Abraham can
[1:25:37] talk to you. I'd say maybe one day he's
[1:25:40] out there and he's picking up some
[1:25:42] forget me knots.
[1:25:44] Surely he's forgotten me.
[1:25:48] I've seen cycle after cycle.
[1:25:50] She loves me. She loves me not. She
[1:25:53] loves me. She loves me not. She loves
[1:25:55] me. He loves me. He loves me not. He lo
[1:25:57] She loves me.
[1:25:59] He's watched her go. He's watched Sarah
[1:26:01] go through menopause. He's watched her
[1:26:04] go through cycles. He's he Abraham has
[1:26:06] went through criticism. He has went
[1:26:08] through all of it.
[1:26:12] People making fun of him,
[1:26:15] but he ain't ashamed of you
[1:26:18] and he ain't ashamed of your testimony
[1:26:20] and he ain't ashamed of where you are.
[1:26:22] But if I could just echo into your ears
[1:26:25] just for a minute where God speaks to
[1:26:28] Abraham and says,"Abraham, I know you're
[1:26:30] going through some tough times. I know
[1:26:32] you're going through some trials right
[1:26:34] now down there in Leosa, but I want you
[1:26:36] to know I'm going to borrow your body to
[1:26:40] produce a miracle because I need
[1:26:42] somebody that will trust me through the
[1:26:45] cycles, that will trust me through the
[1:26:47] fluctuations of faith, that will trust
[1:26:50] me through criticism. I'm wanting to
[1:26:52] borrow your body
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; to prove that I am Jehovah Gyra.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Abraham has fellowshipped with him.
[1:27:07] He spoke with him.
[1:27:10] He's been used of God. God has led him
[1:27:12] here, let him there. He has a voice that
[1:27:16] speaks to him. It leads him over into
[1:27:18] this land and it leads him here. God
[1:27:22] begins to show Abraham visions and
[1:27:24] Abraham goes to the visions and he walks
[1:27:27] because God is wanting to borrow his
[1:27:30] body.
[1:27:33] But now
[1:27:35] the voice and the vision is getting
[1:27:38] ready to take on a body.
[1:27:41] the one that has spoke to him in his
[1:27:44] most delicate moment.
[1:27:49] Does anybody see me?
[1:27:52] Does anybody care?
[1:27:58] And God is about to do something of the
[1:28:02] phenomenal.
[1:28:08] I could see him as he steps out of the
[1:28:10] corridors of heaven said, "Come here,
[1:28:12] Gabriel. Come here, Michael.
[1:28:16] Today, we're going down to Abraham.
[1:28:19] Abraham's in fits. Sarah's in fits.
[1:28:22] She's going, she's hot and bothered.
[1:28:25] Lot's wife has got all the nice things.
[1:28:28] She's got everything. She's got
[1:28:30] everything that they can throw that
[1:28:31] Sodom can throw at her. They She's got
[1:28:33] it all. And Sarah's up there. She's in a
[1:28:36] bad mood. Things are out of sorts. Come
[1:28:39] on, Gabriel. Come on, Michael. Today,
[1:28:42] we're going down to the house of Abraham
[1:28:44] to encourage him.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; That this life has not been in vain,
[1:28:50] that you didn't go through the trials in
[1:28:52] vain, that you didn't go through the
[1:28:54] circumstances in vain.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; You can hear the prophet in Jehovah
[1:28:59] Gyra. To me, it makes it so real in the
[1:29:02] 1964 series. He comes in. He said, "I
[1:29:05] see him.
[1:29:07] Here comes some milk, isn't it?"
[1:29:10] And he picks up some potass and some
[1:29:13] calcium
[1:29:15] and this element.
[1:29:19] Now, I have to
[1:29:22] ask for some liberty right here
[1:29:25] because I don't have scripture on it,
[1:29:28] but I'd say he knew exactly where to
[1:29:31] pick the dust up at.
[1:29:33] He knew exactly
[1:29:36] because he wanted a body that Abraham
[1:29:40] would recognize.
[1:29:41] Now, he could have showed up.
[1:29:44] I'm going to drop a hammer right here.
[1:29:47] He could have showed up as a black man.
[1:29:49] He could have showed up as a white man.
[1:29:52] He could have showed up as a Chinese
[1:29:54] man.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; But Abraham still would have knew.
[1:30:00] He still would have knew that that was
[1:30:03] the same one that was leading him. Let
[1:30:05] me say hallelujah. It does not matter if
[1:30:09] this message comes from a black man or a
[1:30:11] Chinese man or a white man. God wants a
[1:30:15] body. Hallelujah.
[1:30:19] And his body will know exactly who it
[1:30:23] is.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:29] Well, how can you be so definite on
[1:30:32] that, brother Andrew?
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Because the voice, Hallelujah, the voice
[1:30:37] had already talked to Abraham. And just
[1:30:40] a few days before Melzdc shows up in a
[1:30:44] body, he starts talking to Abraham and
[1:30:46] says, "I'll no longer call you Abram,
[1:30:48] but I'll call you Abraham. I'm going to
[1:30:51] put a part of myself on the inside."
[1:30:53] Hallelujah.
[1:30:55] I'm going to put a part of myself on the
[1:30:57] inside of your body
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; because you as a leas leosian
[1:31:05] could have never produced a son of man.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; But because this mechazdc
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; came to this body and filled you with
[1:31:14] his life.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; What are you saying?
[1:31:20] I'm saying the same Melzdc that met
[1:31:22] Abraham stood right here.
[1:31:26] You watch what brother Ram says about
[1:31:29] Abraham. He said, "You watch the effect
[1:31:32] of the revelation that it had on
[1:31:34] Abraham," he said when he called him
[1:31:37] Abraham. Hallelujah.
[1:31:41] He knew
[1:31:45] nobody else has called me that.
[1:31:49] Everybody else is making fun of me.
[1:31:52] Everybody else is laughing at me.
[1:31:54] Everybody's talking about my wife.
[1:31:56] Everybody's saying all kinds of things
[1:31:58] about this message. I said, "There was a
[1:32:00] cloud and there was a pillar of fire,
[1:32:02] but where's it at now?" El Abraham,
[1:32:04] where's it at?
[1:32:07] But I recognize
[1:32:09] that was a son of man that was speaking
[1:32:11] out of the seventh star.
[1:32:15] And he said, "I'll no longer call you
[1:32:17] church. I'll no longer call you Abram,
[1:32:20] but I'll call you Abraham. And when he
[1:32:23] said, "I'll call you bride," you knew.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; You knew
[1:32:30] this was that Melzdc.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; That same one.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:41] What is he looking for
[1:32:44] about
[1:32:46] to produce a miracle?
[1:32:51] when he sees the voice.
[1:32:55] Why are y'all so adamant on preaching
[1:32:56] the message, Brother Andrew? I can take
[1:32:59] it from this scripture right here and
[1:33:00] preach a message of the hour of the rest
[1:33:01] of my life out of Genesis 18.
[1:33:06] Why are you so adamant on preaching it?
[1:33:11] Because you watch the change that this
[1:33:13] Melzdc brings.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Let me say this to you. Religion offered
[1:33:17] me everything, but it never changed me.
[1:33:19] The world offered me everything, but it
[1:33:22] never changed me. Drugs offered me
[1:33:24] everything. Money has been offered to
[1:33:26] me, but it never changed anything. But
[1:33:28] as soon as this Mazdc showed up and
[1:33:32] wanted my body,
[1:33:34] hallelujah, everything changed.
[1:33:41] I'd say that Abraham looked over at
[1:33:43] Sarah and said, "It's time for our
[1:33:45] miracle, honey. It's time for a change."
[1:33:49] He showed up at the door. He's here.
[1:33:52] He's here. Elijah's God is here.
[1:33:57] What are you saying? He's not dead. He's
[1:33:59] here. He's alive. He's the same
[1:34:02] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:34:07] [Applause]
[1:34:14] Brother man said,
[1:34:17] "This is my ministry
[1:34:21] to declare him
[1:34:24] that he's here."
[1:34:27] What are you saying? He's here.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:34:35] Abraham knew him
[1:34:38] by his characteristics.
[1:34:43] He knew that that was the same voice.
[1:34:46] I never met William Brown.
[1:34:50] I never saw them three squirrels. I
[1:34:53] never saw the mountain as it as it was
[1:34:56] covered with snow and sle. I never saw
[1:34:58] that mountain clear up completely storm
[1:35:02] eradicate from it.
[1:35:03] I never saw sister Ma and the tumors
[1:35:06] leave her body.
[1:35:08] But I have seen this third pole in
[1:35:10] action. I have seen that the same one
[1:35:12] that Abraham met, I have met. It was
[1:35:15] him. It was his voice. He was speaking
[1:35:17] to a Kentucky man. Why? Because
[1:35:20] hallelujah. There was a lot of people.
[1:35:22] There was a lot of people that was in
[1:35:24] line to be Malachi 4. They wanted to
[1:35:27] fulfill it. They wanted to run. They
[1:35:29] wanted to do everything. We heard a lot
[1:35:31] about Elijah's mantels and Elisha's
[1:35:33] mantels,
[1:35:34] but there was something different about
[1:35:37] this body. And he planted it his body
[1:35:40] over there in Kentucky. And he raised
[1:35:42] him up here in Jeffersonville, Indiana.
[1:35:44] And he brought a made a man that didn't
[1:35:46] have an education, but he made him a
[1:35:48] preacher of preachers
[1:35:51] because he knew that he could borrow
[1:35:53] that man's body.
[1:35:55] He could have sat with presidents. He
[1:35:57] could have sat with governors. He could
[1:35:59] add millions and millions of dollars,
[1:36:01] but God needed a body that would humble
[1:36:04] himself that could present this body.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Man said, "You notice the
[1:36:15] harmony
[1:36:17] between the father and the son." John
[1:36:20] 5:19 he said that same harmony is now to
[1:36:24] be amongst the groom and his bride.
[1:36:29] That's why when brother Brandham comes
[1:36:31] in Christ the mystery of God revealed
[1:36:34] he said she
[1:36:38] is him.
[1:36:41] Some people have stumbled over those
[1:36:42] three words.
[1:36:45] They don't understand.
[1:36:52] But what does the prophet say? That in
[1:36:55] the last day that he will confound her
[1:37:00] by the prophet and the bride. That the
[1:37:03] prophet, the word and the bride will be
[1:37:07] saying the same thing. The spirit and
[1:37:10] the bride say come. They are saying the
[1:37:15] same thing.
[1:37:17] Now, if William Brandon would have
[1:37:18] showed up, I would have used different
[1:37:23] verbiage. Or if he would have tried to
[1:37:26] be somebody,
[1:37:31] it would have never got him anywhere.
[1:37:37] He said, "Now you know that I'm
[1:37:39] completely helpless
[1:37:42] without him."
[1:37:44] He said, "But when he comes near,"
[1:37:47] he said, "I can take every spirit under
[1:37:51] my control."
[1:37:53] I'll just be honest with you. Every
[1:37:56] person here is carrying a spirit.
[1:38:01] But here's a man that knows where he's
[1:38:04] standing at.
[1:38:06] He said when he comes near,
[1:38:09] he said, "And there he is. He's coming
[1:38:12] out of that district right there. The
[1:38:13] angel of the Lord is moving right here.
[1:38:16] He's here. And I now take every spirit
[1:38:21] under my control."
[1:38:24] Now, was that a man or was that God
[1:38:27] borrowing a body?
[1:38:29] Let me let me just show you that this is
[1:38:32] none other than the same Melzdc. Brother
[1:38:35] Brandham said in the message trial, he
[1:38:37] said, "I challenge you to believe that
[1:38:39] Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of
[1:38:41] the son of man in human flesh through
[1:38:44] the bride's body." Again, in thy seed
[1:38:47] shall possess the gate. He said, "I
[1:38:49] challenge you to believe. Do you believe
[1:38:51] it?" He said, "Let you know that it's
[1:38:53] the same angel. I'll turn my back. Right
[1:38:56] straight behind me is a man and he's
[1:38:58] praying for a mother and a father, heart
[1:38:59] trouble, arthritis. He said they come
[1:39:01] from Arkansas and their name is Smith. I
[1:39:04] believe you. You believe with all of
[1:39:05] your heart back there, Mr. and Mrs.
[1:39:07] Smith, will you go home and receive your
[1:39:09] healing and be made well in the name of
[1:39:12] Jesus Christ. Amen. If you believe it
[1:39:14] with all your heart, then go on and
[1:39:16] receive it. Now, who was that?
[1:39:22] It was the same one that had his back
[1:39:25] turned to Abraham's tent
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; and said, "Why is Sarah back there
[1:39:32] laughing? What's she laughing about
[1:39:34] these things for?" The prophet said,
[1:39:35] "Now the Holy Spirit, do you believe him
[1:39:37] now? If thou can't believe, I'll turn my
[1:39:40] back to the audience.
[1:39:47] I'll turn my back to the audience. Now,
[1:39:51] who is that?
[1:39:54] It can't be a man.
[1:39:56] And I'll turn my back to the audience.
[1:39:58] You pray. See, brother, you don't have
[1:40:00] to be looking at people standing here
[1:40:03] now. I I see a woman and she's praying.
[1:40:06] She is wearing glasses and she's praying
[1:40:08] for her eyes. Yes. Cuz they're getting
[1:40:10] dim. Here she is sitting right here.
[1:40:12] Right back here and glasses on. She's
[1:40:14] been healed once before in my meetings.
[1:40:17] That's right. That is right. That's
[1:40:19] true. Now, what's she praying about? All
[1:40:21] right. Now, you can go home and believe
[1:40:23] with all your heart and be made well.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Who is that?
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; So that you'll see that it's not
[1:40:30] psychology
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; and that I'm reading your mind. I'll
[1:40:34] turn my back to you. How about up here
[1:40:36] in this section? This was dunce one in
[1:40:39] the anggeles temple. Sister brother
[1:40:41] David, you remember? You see? So that
[1:40:43] you'll see I'm talking to you. That
[1:40:45] shows that I have no contact with the
[1:40:48] people there. Surely now I know you
[1:40:50] understand. But I'm asking the grace of
[1:40:52] God to do something that the people
[1:40:55] might know. Yes, I see a young person, a
[1:40:58] young girl. She's from away from here.
[1:41:01] She isn't from this country. She's from
[1:41:03] a country that's raining and it's got a
[1:41:06] lot of trees and moss. Ah, she's from
[1:41:08] Oregon. Hallelujah. She's got epileptic
[1:41:11] fits. She's out there. Do you believe
[1:41:14] that Jesus Christ will make you well? Do
[1:41:16] you accept it for her? Stand up. Stand
[1:41:18] up, sister. Go on home. I rebuke the
[1:41:21] devil. Do you believe with all of your
[1:41:23] heart?
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; What was it? Melazdc was vindicating
[1:41:31] himself
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; through this body. If that isn't the
[1:41:35] same angel, I'll turn my back. The angel
[1:41:37] of the Lord is in that district right
[1:41:39] there. See if that's the same angel.
[1:41:41] There's a woman right back there behind
[1:41:42] that man. She's praying for her husband
[1:41:44] because he won't go to church.
[1:41:46] Hallelujah. You believe, sister, that he
[1:41:49] will go to church if you'll Hallelujah.
[1:41:52] If you'll just raise up. That's true.
[1:41:54] There's her hand. See, stand up, sister.
[1:41:57] So the people So the people can see you.
[1:42:00] Wasn't you praying, Lord? God has about
[1:42:03] your husband's needs. Is that the desire
[1:42:06] of your heart? Just praying for me to
[1:42:08] call you. Raise up your hands. She's
[1:42:10] overcome just at that time. She's
[1:42:12] standing there.
[1:42:14] Was those things true that was said,
[1:42:22] brother.
[1:42:24] Now, man's word won't act like that.
[1:42:31] If I was back
[1:42:34] in brother Maram's day,
[1:42:38] then I could go to him
[1:42:41] and things would be different.
[1:42:50] The same faith you got right now,
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; the same ability you got right now,
[1:42:58] well, things would have been different.
[1:43:00] Isn't he the same yesterday, today, and
[1:43:04] forever?
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Didn't his word tell us that if we would
[1:43:08] come to him with the same kind of faith,
[1:43:11] then we would get the same kind of
[1:43:12] results. We don't need William Brandham
[1:43:15] in the building.
[1:43:17] All we need is this Melazedc.
[1:43:23] What is it? When the preacher gets to
[1:43:25] preaching and all of a sudden the
[1:43:27] anointing of God strikes him and takes
[1:43:29] him down through your corridor, what is
[1:43:31] it that's the bulldozer of the Holy
[1:43:33] Ghost coming down through your ten alley
[1:43:35] to minister the word of life to you? It
[1:43:38] is the word made flesh again.
[1:43:45] What does the Bible say in Isaiah 9 and6
[1:43:50] that unto us the child is born unto us a
[1:43:53] son is given and the government shall be
[1:43:57] upon his shoulders.
[1:43:59] What is the government? It's the
[1:44:01] headship. What does brother Bam teach
[1:44:03] us? He said that government the headship
[1:44:06] has connected to the body. He said, "And
[1:44:08] his shoulders is his body that is here
[1:44:11] on earth." When you look at Revelations
[1:44:13] chapter 10 and you see Revelations 10:1,
[1:44:17] but they're in there, hallelujah, his
[1:44:20] feet as pillars of fire.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; He needs your feet.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; He needs your mouth. He needs your
[1:44:29] faith.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:44:36] I'm working on something here and I'm
[1:44:38] going to ask the musicians to come help
[1:44:40] me finish this p this this next portion
[1:44:43] of my sermon.
[1:44:47] They already know about this. So don't
[1:44:49] don't dismiss me right now. Don't
[1:44:51] dismiss me. I need you I need you to pay
[1:44:55] attention.
[1:45:00] Brother Random said when he came to
[1:45:02] Abraham,
[1:45:04] don't don't lose your attention
[1:45:07] just because they're moving. They're
[1:45:09] they're just a part they're ministers
[1:45:11] right now. He came to Abraham as a man
[1:45:16] under the oak tree.
[1:45:18] Now look at there. There came a man to
[1:45:20] Abraham. Three of them that sat down
[1:45:21] under the oak tree. Three of them.
[1:45:23] Notice after he talked to Abraham, why
[1:45:27] did he come?
[1:45:29] Brother Random asked this question. Why
[1:45:32] did he come?
[1:45:34] Abraham being the one with the promise
[1:45:36] and the message of the coming son and
[1:45:38] the message of the coming son and also
[1:45:40] he was God's word prophet that was
[1:45:42] trusting God's word calling anything
[1:45:44] anything contrary as though it wasn't.
[1:45:49] So the word had to come to a prophet.
[1:45:53] Why did he come? Why did he come in this
[1:45:55] hour? He didn't go down a lot,
[1:45:59] but he came to Abraham. He stayed up
[1:46:01] there with Abraham's group because a
[1:46:04] bride has got to have a relationship
[1:46:08] with mec.
[1:46:14] Now
[1:46:16] let me just
[1:46:19] do this in the best way that I know how.
[1:46:24] And the Lord laid this on my heart this
[1:46:25] evening and I I hope it comes through
[1:46:27] the way he give it to me because I had
[1:46:28] to Katie was actually in my study and I
[1:46:30] said I got to go.
[1:46:34] I hope it comes through how he painted
[1:46:36] it to me.
[1:46:39] You see,
[1:46:42] you can have the greatest abilities
[1:46:48] And you can be the greatest composer of
[1:46:50] music,
[1:46:53] but if there is nothing there
[1:46:56] to be able to sound your music through,
[1:47:02] it will never produce
[1:47:05] what is in the mind of the composer.
[1:47:09] There was a man by the name of Adolf
[1:47:11] Saxs in he was from Belgium
[1:47:15] and there you begin to see Adolf Saxs if
[1:47:19] you begin to study out his life that
[1:47:21] Adolf Saxs was he was the one of the
[1:47:25] greatest clarinetist at the time. The
[1:47:28] clarinet was created in 1700, early
[1:47:31] 1700s.
[1:47:33] But Adolf Saxs was also one of the
[1:47:36] greatest composers of music at that
[1:47:39] time. But yet he had this music in his
[1:47:43] heart that would not produce the sound
[1:47:46] that he was looking for.
[1:47:49] And so he he started crafting
[1:47:52] a body.
[1:47:54] and he wanted a certain sound with his
[1:47:56] music that had the woodwind and the
[1:48:00] brass completely family joined together.
[1:48:04] So Adolf Saxs
[1:48:07] created the saxophone
[1:48:10] and he he was looking for this certain
[1:48:14] music. He was looking for this certain
[1:48:16] sound. And even though he could produce
[1:48:19] all kinds of great music and all kinds
[1:48:22] of great things through his clarinet,
[1:48:25] but he still could never produce what he
[1:48:28] was looking for until he created the
[1:48:32] saxophone. Go ahead, sister.
[1:48:35] [Music]
[1:48:42] [Music]
[1:48:52] So he started crafting it and started
[1:48:55] molding the body
[1:48:58] to produce the sound that was on the
[1:49:02] inside of his heart. because in his mind
[1:49:05] he had this beautiful picture of the
[1:49:08] sound of music that was going to come
[1:49:10] forth and he started working on it
[1:49:12] tirelessly and he started molding it and
[1:49:15] he started crafting it. What are you
[1:49:17] saying? I'm saying
[1:49:20] that the Methodists
[1:49:21] had the sheet music, that the Lutheran
[1:49:24] had the sheet music, that the
[1:49:26] Philadelphiaians and the Pentecostals
[1:49:29] and they all had the sheet music, but
[1:49:31] they could never produce the sound that
[1:49:34] the composer was looking for.
[1:49:38] But he had a body. But he had a body
[1:49:41] that was going to bring out a sound. But
[1:49:44] in order for that body to sound it out
[1:49:47] correctly, he had to anoint a prophet in
[1:49:49] this age to be able to bring out the
[1:49:52] sheet music to bring it out in such a
[1:49:54] way that it would sound right. Go ahead,
[1:49:57] Sister Rapil.
[1:50:01] And all of a sudden, the composer starts
[1:50:04] seeing it in action. There it is. There
[1:50:07] it is. That's what I'm looking for. I
[1:50:10] can see it in William Brandom. I can see
[1:50:12] it. but he could not have it on his own.
[1:50:16] But he needed a body that could live it
[1:50:19] out. So he released the opening of the
[1:50:22] word and all of a sudden
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:29] [Applause]
[1:50:30] [Music]
[1:50:53] Hallelujah.
[1:50:56] The message was powerful in William
[1:50:58] Brandham. But you take this message and
[1:51:01] put it on the inside of a many member
[1:51:04] bride.
[1:51:07] That's what God is looking for. a
[1:51:10] symphony that will sound out the sheet
[1:51:12] music.
[1:51:17] Now the prophet,
[1:51:19] he says it just right.
[1:51:23] He says it just right.
[1:51:26] [Music]
[1:51:31] This is the way I want it said. I'll
[1:51:33] give you the word.
[1:51:36] I'll just transfer the word to your
[1:51:38] lips. You say it.
[1:51:41] [Music]
[1:51:44] Satan's got no problem if it's in one
[1:51:47] man.
[1:51:50] But all of a sudden, he puts it in a
[1:51:52] many member bride.
[1:51:55] Notice the harmony between the bride and
[1:51:59] the bridegroom. She knows what he wants
[1:52:04] done with the word.
[1:52:06] She performs the word in his command, in
[1:52:10] his name. She doesn't move without the
[1:52:13] word. She doesn't speak without the
[1:52:15] word. She doesn't shout without the
[1:52:17] word. She doesn't do anything without
[1:52:20] the word. This body is the accompaniment
[1:52:26] of the groom.
[1:52:29] What are you saying, brother Andrew?
[1:52:32] This is God's chosen place of worship.
[1:52:39] He finally
[1:52:41] has a body.
[1:52:44] How great
[1:52:46] thou are.
[1:52:51] This s
[1:52:55] my soul.
[1:52:59] I say
[1:53:02] your God
[1:53:04] to thee.
[1:53:07] [Music]
[1:53:09] How great
[1:53:12] thou are,
[1:53:18] how great
[1:53:22] thou are.
[1:53:25] [Music]
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful?
[1:53:29] that you had a prophet
[1:53:32] and begin to release
[1:53:34] what God had in his mind.
[1:53:37] What men had probed at, what they looked
[1:53:40] at.
[1:53:41] [Music]
[1:53:43] It ain't them people.
[1:53:45] It's a spirit.
[1:53:48] But now God's spirit
[1:53:50] is a body.
[1:53:52] [Music]
[1:53:54] A body that can work through. A body
[1:53:57] that can lift
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:06] my soul,
[1:54:10] my strength
[1:54:15] to thee.
[1:54:18] [Music]
[1:54:22] How great
[1:54:24] thou are,
[1:54:28] [Music]
[1:54:30] how great
[1:54:33] thou are.
[1:54:35] Oh, the splendor of the king.
[1:54:40] Oh, glory majesty
[1:54:44] in all angels.
[1:54:47] All angels.
[1:54:51] ransom
[1:54:54] [Music]
[1:54:59] and trembles at his voice.
[1:55:04] How great,
[1:55:06] how great
[1:55:08] is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great
[1:55:14] is my God and all see how great
[1:55:20] on land and sea
[1:55:22] [Music]
[1:55:25] land and sea
[1:55:30] and open
[1:55:32] hand.
[1:55:35] [Music]
[1:55:38] Oh
[1:55:40] my time is gone. Oh,
[1:55:45] the bright
[1:55:47] are
[1:55:49] Oh, soon we're going home.
[1:55:52] Soon we're going home.
[1:55:57] My God. Oh, sing. Anybody want to sing
[1:56:01] with me?
[1:56:04] Oh, I don't see how great
[1:56:08] how great
[1:56:10] is our God
[1:56:13] fail before I
[1:56:17] for
[1:56:30] himself
[1:56:31] around You were taken from his side to
[1:56:38] reign upon the throne.
[1:56:40] Hallelujah.
[1:56:43] How great
[1:56:46] is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great.
[1:56:52] Oh,
[1:56:56] oh, let him see it all.
[1:57:00] Come on, somebody lift your voice.
[1:57:04] Yes, he's the name of all and he's
[1:57:10] worthy.

[1:57:19] is my God. Yes, he is.
[1:57:24] is
[1:57:26] [Applause]
[1:57:28] my God is worthy.
[1:57:33] Hallelujah.
[1:57:35] [Music]
[1:57:38] One more time. Let it be. Yes. He's the
[1:57:41] name
[1:57:46] of all my God is.
[1:57:53] Come on. Let all the earth and let all
[1:57:56] of heaven hear him saying there is none
[1:58:00] but my God.
[1:58:03] [Music]
[1:58:05] How great
[1:58:07] is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great
[1:58:13] is our God?
[1:58:15] And all see how great

[1:59:15] Oh, sing with me. How great
[1:59:20] is our God
[1:59:22] and all.
[1:59:25] [Music]
[1:59:26] [Applause]
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; All right, sisters. I want you to sing
[1:59:31] it to sisters.
[1:59:35] [Music]
[1:59:43] our God.
[1:59:45] And see how great,

[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, brothers. Lift your voice just
[1:59:54] now. Oh, how great
[1:59:59] is our God.
[2:00:01] Oh, sing with me. How great
[2:00:05] is our God.
[2:00:07] And I will see how great,
[2:00:11] how great. Now let the body of Jesus
[2:00:14] Christ in one voice sing it. Oh, how
[2:00:17] great
[2:00:19] is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great
[2:00:25] is our God.
[2:00:28] Let all see how great.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, how great
[2:00:34] is our God. Let the body of Jesus Christ
[2:00:37] say
[2:00:39] I pray
[2:00:42] our God. Oh sing with me how
[2:00:47] our God
[2:00:49] and all sing.
[2:00:54] [Music]
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; You know Satan hates this. He hates this
[2:01:00] because revelation has struck your
[2:01:02] hearts.
[2:01:04] He is a name above all names. But he's
[2:01:07] not up in heaven. He's right here. He's
[2:01:11] right here. He's right here. He's right
[2:01:14] here in this body.
[2:01:18] God has borrowed a body.
[2:01:23] I love when I love when the question
[2:01:25] answers they asked the prophet said this
[2:01:28] is very simple. See, is the body of
[2:01:32] Jesus Christ and the bride of Jesus
[2:01:34] Christ the same thing? I love the
[2:01:36] prophet's answer. Yes.
[2:01:40] Yes. Yes. The body and the bride is the
[2:01:45] same thing. This body, this body, this
[2:01:50] mortal flesh will put on immortality one
[2:01:53] of these mornings and this body shall be
[2:01:57] changed.
[2:02:01] Oh, how great
[2:02:03] is our God. Oh, sing with me.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; I wish I was a choir director.
[2:02:12] [Music]
[2:02:15] [Applause]
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; I always always love watching them. I've
[2:02:21] never been to one of them orchestras,
[2:02:23] but that little dude has got some power.
[2:02:27] He's got some power.
[2:02:30] The whole place is silent and
[2:02:32] everybody's waiting on the maestro.
[2:02:37] And he walks out there and he takes his
[2:02:40] little stick
[2:02:43] and he calls the orchestra
[2:02:48] and he just taps it and they come
[2:02:52] together.
[2:02:54] I love it. When the one that wrote the
[2:02:57] word begins to operate through the body
[2:03:01] and they come into order and they start
[2:03:03] saying the same thing that Melazedc
[2:03:06] said, that Jesus Christ said, that
[2:03:09] William Brandom said, that body is now
[2:03:12] saying the same thing.
[2:03:17] I tell you, Satan don't know what to do
[2:03:19] with that. He don't know what to do with
[2:03:21] that kind of people that know who they
[2:03:23] are and know what God's called them for.
[2:03:26] I say go out there and tear up Satan's
[2:03:27] kingdom. I say tear it up. I say let God
[2:03:31] borrow your body and tear down Satan's
[2:03:33] kingdom. Cast out the devil. Walk out
[2:03:36] there and win. Come on, brother Matt.
[2:03:40] Sing it with us.
[2:03:44] Hallelujah.
[2:03:47] [Music]
[2:03:50] is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great
[2:03:55] is our God.
[2:03:57] And come to see how great,
[2:04:00] how great
