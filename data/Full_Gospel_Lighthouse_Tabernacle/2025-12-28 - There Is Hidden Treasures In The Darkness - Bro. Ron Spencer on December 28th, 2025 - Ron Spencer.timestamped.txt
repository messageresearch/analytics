[23:30] going to lose our gravitation.
[23:33] And in [music] the middle of the air, be
[23:38] caught away.
[23:41] [music] Lord, I believe he's coming
[23:43] [singing] back like he said. [music]
[23:48] Lord, [singing]
[23:49] I believe that trumpets going to sound
[23:52] so loud. He'll wake the righteous.
[23:57] Oh, [music]
[23:58] he loves twinkling. Oh, that eye. Lord,
[24:02] you split those [music] Easter skies.
[24:06] And I believe he's coming back
[24:10] like he [music] said.
[24:16] [applause]
[25:02] Sorry, I just like to say something.
[25:04] Um, I had another song in mind, but I
[25:08] know I've [music] sang this song before,
[25:10] but this one came upon my heart this
[25:12] morning, and uh, it's the song I'd like
[25:15] to really close out the year with.
[25:18] This year has been very memorable year
[25:20] for me. Um God has done a lot in my
[25:22] life. And uh even in my darkest times
[25:26] this year, he's poured his love out to
[25:28] me even when I didn't deserve it.
[25:31] And uh
[25:33] he's just such a good God, such a loving
[25:35] God.
[25:37] Even when Satan lied to me and said he
[25:39] did he wasn't to me. And uh
[25:44] so if you all could sing this song with
[25:46] me
[25:52] I don't know how
[25:56] to say exactly how I feel.
[25:59] I can't
[26:01] begin [music]
[26:03] to tell you what your love has been.
[26:07] I'm lost
[26:09] for years.
[26:13] [music]

[48:49] yay, though I walk through the valley of
[48:51] the shadow of death, I will fear no
[48:54] evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and
[48:57] thy staff, they comfort me. Thou
[49:00] preparest a table before me in the
[49:03] presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest
[49:06] my head with oil, and my cup runth over.
[49:09] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow

[49:32] hearts. We know that our desire is for
[49:35] you. And thank you for that desire
[49:37] because so many don't have it. They
[49:40] don't have a desire to come to church.
[49:42] No desire to serve you. Lord, we love
[49:45] you with all of our hearts. and that
[49:48] there be anything in our lives that that
[49:50] shouldn't be there. Lord, we ask you to
[49:52] forgive us and and take that out of our
[49:54] lives and minister to us that we would
[49:57] be better Christians today. Minister in
[50:01] our lives and you see the many needs in
[50:03] our bodies. Sister Kim Weeks that is in
[50:06] in a quite a
[50:09] difficult situation. We ask you that you
[50:12] would touch her, be her doctor, be the
[50:15] great physician in a special way and
[50:18] bless this audience and even the
[50:20] audience that's watching today in Jesus
[50:23] Christ's name. Amen and amen. You may be
[50:26] seated.
[50:30] Amen.
[50:34] Sister Crystal, I have a strange
[50:35] request. if you would give me the last
[50:37] verse of on the wings of a snow white
[50:40] dove.
[50:41] [clears throat]
[50:42] The scripture says in Psalms 23,
[50:46] "Yay, though I walk through the valley
[50:48] of the shadow of death, I will fear no
[50:52] evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and
[50:56] thy staff comfort me." God doesn't tell
[51:00] you, "I'm not I'm I'm going to keep you
[51:02] from walking through it.
[51:05] He doesn't say, "Now, before you get to
[51:07] a spot of a of a difficult situation,
[51:11] I'm going to stop that. I'm not going to
[51:13] allow you to have to go through that."
[51:17] He knows life,
[51:20] &gt;&gt; and life's got difficult parts to it.
[51:23] And he says, "Yay, though I walk through
[51:25] the valley of the shadow of death, I
[51:28] will feel no evil,
[51:32] for thou art with me." I wouldn't want
[51:34] to walk through it without him. Do you?
[51:37] &gt;&gt; I don't want to cross the road without
[51:38] the Lord.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[51:43] Thou preparest a table before me in the
[51:46] presence of mine enemies, and thou
[51:48] anointest my head with oil, and my cup
[51:50] runth over. Brother Brandham had been s
[51:53] through some incredibly difficult times.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; As a prophet of God, incredible
[52:00] pressures that was around him. And if I
[52:02] could just say a couple of things here.
[52:04] Brother Ben Brandman watched his mother
[52:06] and his father pass away. He had watched
[52:08] his wife pass away. He had buried his
[52:10] little girl.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; And watched her pass away.
[52:16] marry again and and then watch his
[52:19] children grow up. Traveling through all
[52:21] the world and seeing every kind of a
[52:24] difficult situation that there was
[52:27] &gt;&gt; and doing even at his best, watching
[52:30] friends walk away because of truth,
[52:34] &gt;&gt; because of the word of God. Watch
[52:36] friends turn away from him. That's
[52:38] right.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; And if I could put it in perspective,
[52:43] some of those friends would offer him
[52:46] incredible money
[52:49] &gt;&gt; to stand in their churches and just
[52:51] compromise a little bit
[52:53] &gt;&gt; or not say difficult things.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Let me just say in the early 60s a
[53:01] million dollars was a lot of money. Come
[53:03] on.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Million dollars for most of us today is
[53:08] a lot of money.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll actually saw the check.
[53:15] A million dollar check.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; That's a lot of money.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; And he turned it down
[53:29] &gt;&gt; for you.
[53:34] for you. He turned it down for you.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[53:43] Let Let me just say as I was just
[53:45] sharing this last night in the office.
[53:48] When brother Brandham was given an
[53:51] opportunity to go beyond the curtain of
[53:53] time,
[53:55] you remember he began to see friends and
[53:57] they were coming up and hugging him. And
[53:59] he tells us that sisters was coming up
[54:01] and hugging him and it was such a
[54:04] powerful awesome atmosphere
[54:08] and and the angel is with him and he's
[54:11] speaking with him and they're they're
[54:13] actually having conversation
[54:15] and brother Ram asked him says or the
[54:18] angel asked him said do you know who who
[54:20] that lady was that that just hugged you
[54:24] and he said no I don't believe I do. You
[54:27] led her to the Lord when she was past
[54:30] 95.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; If you could just stop and absorb that
[54:36] just for a moment. In that place, she's
[54:40] totally unrecognizable
[54:42] in her youth.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; And what an atmosphere. Brother Anne
[54:47] would talk about it'll take perfect
[54:50] love.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Perfect love to get there. Amen.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; It's an atmosphere towards no sin.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; There's no difficulty.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; There's no hard situations of life.
[55:07] There's no time pieces.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; There's there's not a hospital. There's
[55:13] not a police department.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; No psych wards.
[55:19] That's the place we're going to. Amen.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; And so the prophet of God in turning all
[55:26] of these things down had to have
[55:28] something driving him to get a people
[55:31] from this word there.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; And there had to be a people that would
[55:38] lay aside every weight
[55:41] &gt;&gt; and the sin that would so easily beset
[55:43] them and have a goal in THIS LIFE.
[55:47] THERE'S NOTHING HERE. AMEN.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; There's nothing here to keep me.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Could you SAY THAT WITH ME? NOTHING.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would sing the song
[56:04] especially in shreport
[56:08] on the wings of a snow white dove and
[56:10] and he would write a last verse to that
[56:13] song. And if you remember the wings of a
[56:16] snow white dove and let me just caution
[56:17] you here for a moment. Might blow some
[56:19] of your minds. It was a country song.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; A country song. Tops in the billboards.
[56:28] Country song. And here's brother
[56:30] Brandham a prophet singing it.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Hope that don't blow nobody's mind.
[56:37] Nobody walk out of the building.
[56:39] [snorts]
[56:40] He writes this verse and because he's
[56:43] lived it, he can write it.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; It's not somebody else's story, he can
[56:51] write it.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Notice these words. Though I have
[56:55] suffered
[56:57] in many a way.
[56:59] I cried for healing
[57:02] both night and day. Faith wasn't
[57:05] forgotten by the Father above.
[57:09] He gave me his sign
[57:12] on the wings
[57:14] &gt;&gt; of a dove.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Second Corinthians chapter 4 and verse
[57:19] 8.
[57:21] We're troubled on every side
[57:24] yet not distressed.
[57:27] We are perplexed
[57:29] but not in despair.
[57:33] I want to read it again so you catch it.
[57:35] There's two different ways of there's
[57:37] two things looking at right here.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; We are in one world but we have sight of
[57:42] another world.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; We're troubled on every side
[57:47] yet not distressed.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; We are perplexed but not in despair.
[57:54] Persecuted but not forsaken.
[57:57] Cast down
[58:00] but not destroyed.
[58:05] 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse 7. the trial
[58:09] of your faith.
[58:11] Not the trial of Jesus's faith or the
[58:15] brother's faith or the sister's faith.
[58:17] The trial of your faith
[58:21] [snorts]
[58:21] &gt;&gt; being much more precious than of gold
[58:25] that perisheth, though it be tried with
[58:28] fire, might be found
[58:32] under the praise and the honor and the
[58:35] glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
[58:40] Isaiah chapter 53.
[58:43] HE IS DESPISED and rejected of men, a
[58:46] man of sorrows, acquainted with grief,
[58:49] and we hid as if it were our faces from
[58:52] him. He was despised, and we esteemed
[58:55] him not. Surely he hath borne our
[58:58] griefs, and carried our sorrows.
[59:02] Yet did he est yet we did esteem him
[59:06] stricken and smitten of God, and
[59:08] afflicted. We can all say this together,
[59:11] but he was wounded,
[59:14] &gt;&gt; for our transgressions.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; He was bruised for our iniquities. The
[59:20] chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[59:24] And with his stripes,
[59:26] &gt;&gt; we are
[59:27] &gt;&gt; we are healed.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in a gives us a
[59:33] quote in letting off the pressure and I
[59:35] think it's so wonderful. Every time I
[59:37] read this quote, I I think about you,
[59:39] Brother Josh Jones. I think about this.
[59:43] He said, "As a little rabbit,
[59:46] the story of he
[59:48] the hounds was right behind him.
[59:52] He could feel their breath
[59:55] upon his feet."
[59:58] And just a little while, another jump or
[1:00:00] two, that hound was going to get this
[1:00:02] little fella. and he would BE GOBBLED UP
[1:00:06] JUST in a moment.
[1:00:08] But after about IT, HE SAW A HOLE in a
[1:00:11] rock.
[1:00:13] Can you imagine his desperation?
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; And he thought, "IF I COULD ONLY GET TO
[1:00:20] that rock, then I'm safe."
[1:00:23] And just as that dog made that last jump
[1:00:26] at him, he felt his hot breath on his
[1:00:29] heels.
[1:00:30] But he run under that rock
[1:00:34] and he could set down and let off the
[1:00:36] pressure.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; The hound could not scratch through that
[1:00:41] rock.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a rock Jesus is.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we can feel the hounds.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Last few weeks I felt the hounds and the
[1:00:54] scratching. BUT OH, WHAT A ROCK JESUS
[1:00:58] IS.
[1:01:00] WHAT A PROMISE THAT HE IS.
[1:01:03] [applause]
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; The scripture Isaiah 53 says he was
[1:01:11] he was uh he has borne our griefs
[1:01:15] and carried our sorrows.
[1:01:18] I want to just just take a quote a
[1:01:20] couple quotes here.
[1:01:23] Brother Ram says it was only a prefigure
[1:01:26] of a per of a picture that if we could
[1:01:29] just turn our camera now to the morning
[1:01:32] down in Jerusalem,
[1:01:34] I can see out of a window and hear a
[1:01:36] noise. What is it? A priest is saying,
[1:01:42] "Away with such a man."
[1:01:44] And I could hear a little woman run out
[1:01:46] in front of the crowd saying, "What has
[1:01:49] he done?"
[1:01:51] but heal your sick,
[1:01:53] RAISE YOUR DEAD, AND BROUGHT deliverance
[1:01:57] to to those that were captive.
[1:02:00] A big cruel hand would smack her in the
[1:02:03] mouth and say, "Would you listen to that
[1:02:06] woman instead of the priest?" A cruel
[1:02:09] Roman whip was beating him. It's a kind
[1:02:13] of an awful picture,
[1:02:16] but let's raise our shades and look. I
[1:02:19] can hear something bumping through the
[1:02:21] street over those cobblestones. And I
[1:02:24] look out the window and I saw a little
[1:02:26] man with a with a white robe wo
[1:02:30] throughout without seams laying across
[1:02:33] his shoulders packing an old cross as it
[1:02:36] bumps away down in the streets. His
[1:02:40] soul, his shoulders are they're rubbing
[1:02:42] raw. And I notice his little garment
[1:02:46] there. little spots all over it. Those
[1:02:51] spots begins to grow as he as he goes up
[1:02:55] the hill,
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; getting bigger
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; and bigger.
[1:03:05] And after a while,
[1:03:07] they start running into one great big
[1:03:10] spot.
[1:03:12] A great bloody splash against his legs.
[1:03:15] What is it? It's the second Adam. You
[1:03:18] heard brother Andrew talking about the
[1:03:20] first Adam last night. Then the second,
[1:03:22] the second Adam, that seed of the woman
[1:03:26] and the bee of death humming around him,
[1:03:29] his head as it was going up the hill,
[1:03:32] knowing that soon that the devil will
[1:03:34] certainly had the wool pulled over his
[1:03:37] eyes there. THE DEVIL SAID, "HOW COULD A
[1:03:41] MAN THAT CLAIMS TO BE GOD, HOW COULD
[1:03:44] HE?" I CHALLENGED HIM TO A stunt a
[1:03:48] couple of his tricks in front of me and
[1:03:50] he turned it and he turned bread and
[1:03:53] rocks into bread. He failed TO DO IT.
[1:03:57] HOW COULD HE STAND YOU IF HE'S A prophet
[1:04:00] and let a Roman soldier put a rag around
[1:04:03] his face and hit him on the head and and
[1:04:06] stick and say, "Now, IF YOU'RE A
[1:04:08] PROPHET, TELL US WHO HIT YOU."
[1:04:12] And set still.
[1:04:16] He's a faker.
[1:04:18] And I'm coming and I'm going to sting
[1:04:20] him with my sting of death. I'll get him
[1:04:23] now.
[1:04:25] Oh, how he failed. And when they st when
[1:04:28] they hung him on the cross and that bee
[1:04:31] was humming around him,
[1:04:34] if a bee or an insect has a stinger and
[1:04:37] if it ever stings and anchors that
[1:04:40] stinger deep, when he goes away, he can
[1:04:43] never sting again.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; He leaves his stinger in the flesh.
[1:04:51] Death could sting sting a sinner and get
[1:04:54] by WITH IT. BUT THAT TIME HE LEFT a
[1:04:58] stinger in Emmanuel's flesh
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; and he pulled the stinger out. No wonder
[1:05:05] St. Paul could say years after that that
[1:05:08] bee of death was humming around him, "Oh
[1:05:12] death,
[1:05:13] WHERE'S YOUR STINGER?
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; GRAVE, WHERE'S YOUR VICTORY? BUT thanks
[1:05:19] be TO GOD WHO GIVETH us the victory
[1:05:21] through Jesus Christ.
[1:05:24] Death was conquered.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; THE bee can hum around. The bee can can
[1:05:31] buzz and SAY, "AND I GOT YOU." BUT WE
[1:05:34] CAN POINT YONDER to an empty grave
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "THANKS BE TO GOD THAT GIVE US
[1:05:39] SUCH A VICTORY THROUGH THE LORD Jesus
[1:05:42] Christ. He can MAKE NOISE,
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; BUT HE CAN'T SING.
[1:05:53] CUZ HE AIN'T GOT A STINGER NO MORE.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; When he anchored his stinger into the
[1:05:58] flesh of Emmanuel,
[1:06:00] GOD'S FLESH AMONG US, he pulled the
[1:06:04] stinger out of death.
[1:06:06] THAT WAS GOD'S IDEA of his first
[1:06:10] conference.
[1:06:16] I'd like to share this with you.
[1:06:19] Eternal life and what it means.
[1:06:23] Sometimes I think we kind of just become
[1:06:26] passive about what eternal life means.
[1:06:31] Prophet says, he says, thirsting for
[1:06:34] life. if we should take a trip tonight
[1:06:38] and go up into heaven
[1:06:41] and I'd meet Father Abraham and I'd
[1:06:43] say,"Abraham,
[1:06:46] what is the most glorious thing that
[1:06:47] you've ever known?
[1:06:49] What is the most essential thing
[1:06:53] that you could ever have known?"
[1:06:56] Abraham would say unto me,
[1:06:59] "Life eternal."
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:04] I take a little trip and we go again and
[1:07:06] we we go up to meet the Archangel
[1:07:09] Gabriel
[1:07:11] who is the messenger of the covenant to
[1:07:13] the Jewish people who stands at the
[1:07:16] right hand of God, one of the highest
[1:07:19] orders of angels in the heavens. And I
[1:07:22] would say to him,
[1:07:24] Gabriel,
[1:07:25] thou art a mighty angel.
[1:07:29] You're the loved of God and you've been
[1:07:32] here for aons of time
[1:07:35] [clears throat]
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; and you perhaps know everything that in
[1:07:41] the heavens where everything is placed
[1:07:44] because you're one of God's right-and
[1:07:46] angels and you know the great secrets of
[1:07:49] the heavens. You sounded the trumpet at
[1:07:52] the coming of the Lord Jesus. You
[1:07:55] announced his first coming and you will
[1:07:58] announce his second coming.
[1:08:01] So you must be a mighty man or a mighty
[1:08:05] angel. I want to ask you IN ALL OF GOD'S
[1:08:09] TREASURES,
[1:08:10] what is the greatest thing that you have
[1:08:12] found amongst his treasures?
[1:08:15] And I can see Gabriel bring himself to
[1:08:17] attention and say, "The greatest thing
[1:08:19] that I have found in God's treasure
[1:08:22] since he created me is life."
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; God made it to live
[1:08:34] for eternity.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; I think sometimes we don't get that
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; because we can't fathom. Amen.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Eternity.
[1:08:47] Life with no end.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Life
[1:08:54] is the greatest thing that there is.
[1:08:57] No matter how rich you might be,
[1:09:01] no matter how popular you might be,
[1:09:04] no matter who you might be, the greatest
[1:09:08] thing that there is that a man can
[1:09:11] achieve in this earth
[1:09:14] is to achieve
[1:09:16] eternal life. Amen.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Though you might be a king or a
[1:09:22] potentate,
[1:09:25] though you rule the world for a million
[1:09:27] years as a king and a young man and you
[1:09:31] failed to find eternal life, you've lost
[1:09:35] the greatest thing that anyone
[1:09:39] can lose.
[1:09:42] Listen, Hollywood cannot produce eternal
[1:09:46] life.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; The music world and the rock and the
[1:09:51] country and all the nonsense cannot.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; All the sports world cannot.
[1:09:59] Religion cannot.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, YOU'RE PRESENTED WITH THE
[1:10:06] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:10:09] Are you with me now? IT HAS eternal life
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; in it.
[1:10:23] I've often said if I could be a young
[1:10:27] man 25 years old, if God would appear on
[1:10:30] the platform and say,
[1:10:33] "I will turn you 25 years old of age,
[1:10:36] and thou you'll remain for a million
[1:10:38] years, and I'll make you a king over all
[1:10:42] the universe, and everything will be at
[1:10:44] your command.
[1:10:46] or I'll give you a hundred years of
[1:10:49] misery and woe and trouble and sorrow,
[1:10:52] but at the end of that hundred years,
[1:10:54] I'll give you eternal life,
[1:10:58] but at the end of a million years,
[1:11:00] you're lost.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; I say, Lord,
[1:11:07] Lord God, I don't have to wait any
[1:11:10] longer to make my choice.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me have a hundred years of
[1:11:15] misery and woe.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Treasures in the darkness is what I'm
[1:11:20] speaking.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; I don't have to wait any longer to make
[1:11:24] my choice. Let me have the hundred years
[1:11:26] of misery and woe and any kind of death
[1:11:29] that you choose for me to die. Only
[1:11:32] Lord, give me eternal life. Amen.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; For though I owned the whole world and
[1:11:38] was the king over a million years, but
[1:11:40] at the end of a million years I become
[1:11:42] hellbound preacher
[1:11:45] for eternity.
[1:11:48] But no matter how bad my lot is here on
[1:11:52] earth, at the end of my life, if I've
[1:11:55] got eternal life
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; and live blessed presence of God
[1:12:01] forever,
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; and forever,
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; I know for the front row it's difficult
[1:12:10] to to think about life h going past so
[1:12:13] quickly. I know it is. I understand
[1:12:16] that. I lived in sit in your shoes.
[1:12:20] It happens real quick.
[1:12:23] If I can just stop and just bring you up
[1:12:25] to how quick things happen.
[1:12:29] Six years ago,
[1:12:32] six years ago, they gave me four months.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Six years went really quick.
[1:12:42] as I sat with my cancer doctor last week
[1:12:45] and
[1:12:46] and and she was giving me some very
[1:12:49] difficult choices and she says uh
[1:12:56] cuz we're battling between a kidney
[1:12:58] disease and cancer.
[1:13:02] And she says, "You you've got a choice
[1:13:05] to make."
[1:13:08] And she said, "I I was there with you. I
[1:13:10] walked in the room with you and I saw
[1:13:12] your eyes. I saw how you was and she
[1:13:15] said, "I'll never get it all out of my
[1:13:17] mind."
[1:13:23] And so she says,
[1:13:26] "Well,
[1:13:29] would you like to make a choice?" I
[1:13:31] said, "Well, what would your father what
[1:13:33] would you tell your father to do?" That
[1:13:35] kind of put her in a spot.
[1:13:38] Brother Vernon, I I'll be honest with
[1:13:39] you. I want to I want to get to their
[1:13:41] heart. You know, I don't want just their
[1:13:43] knowledge. I want to get to their heart
[1:13:45] because in their heart, they'll tell me
[1:13:46] the truth.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; They won't be practicing. They'll tell
[1:13:50] me the truth.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; And she said, "Well,
[1:13:56] with the cancer that you have, it's an
[1:13:58] extreme high risk." I said, "Well,
[1:14:03] let me help you here."
[1:14:05] I known people that have the same
[1:14:07] medicine that I'm on and they say
[1:14:09] they're completely cancer free and so
[1:14:11] they quit the medicine and two months
[1:14:13] later they're dead.
[1:14:16] Allan Jackson
[1:14:18] was completely cancerree and two months
[1:14:21] later he was dead eat up with cancer. I
[1:14:24] said, ' So, are you telling me that if I
[1:14:27] go off the chemo,
[1:14:29] there's an extreme high risk that two
[1:14:31] months later I'll be gone.
[1:14:34] She just nodded her head.
[1:14:38] You know, these are difficult choices.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Now, listen. I I want to see eternity,
[1:14:44] but I want to stay here with you.
[1:14:52] You know, I I I want to see I want to
[1:14:56] see you, Julia, you'll get married
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; and Adam, I don't know if it'll ever
[1:15:01] happen, but I want to see you guys have
[1:15:02] children,
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; and I'd like to hold them. And
[1:15:07] [applause]
[1:15:15] you know, I'd like to be a part of your
[1:15:17] weddings. I'd like to be a part of your
[1:15:18] life. I'd like to preach to you every
[1:15:20] Sunday morning.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That's what I'd like.
[1:15:25] [applause]
[1:15:30] And so I'm saying all that to say this.
[1:15:32] I know a I know a portion of darkness.
[1:15:37] I've walked some difficult roads. Maybe
[1:15:39] not as difficult as a lot of other
[1:15:41] people has walked, but I I can stand as
[1:15:43] a preacher and understand life.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; And I'm not preaching it from somebody
[1:15:51] else's story.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:15:59] There's a statement that I read to you
[1:16:01] some time ago. Uh I asked God,
[1:16:05] "Why are you taking me through the
[1:16:07] troubled waters?"
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; And he replied to me, "Because your
[1:16:12] enemies can't swim."
[1:16:19] The writer of your New Testament, much
[1:16:21] of it kind of shares some of his
[1:16:24] difficulty in 2 Corinthians 12 and verse
[1:16:28] 6. For though I would would desire to
[1:16:31] glory, I shall not be a fool. For I will
[1:16:34] say the truth, and but now I forebear,
[1:16:36] lest that any any man should think of me
[1:16:39] above measure, seeth me to be, or
[1:16:42] heareth of me, and lest I should be
[1:16:44] exalted above measure, lest that
[1:16:48] though the abundance of revelations
[1:16:51] was given to me, the thorn in the flesh,
[1:16:54] the messenger of Satan, to buffet me,
[1:16:57] lest I should get exalted above measure.
[1:17:00] That's quite that's quite a scripture
[1:17:02] right there.
[1:17:04] God knew how to keep him humble.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; I hope it's not my lot.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Now watch his prayer. For this thing I
[1:17:19] besought the Lord thrice
[1:17:22] that it might depart from me.
[1:17:26] And he said unto me, "My grace is
[1:17:29] sufficient.
[1:17:33] FOR MY STRENGTH IS MADE perfect in
[1:17:35] weakness, and most gladly will I rather
[1:17:37] glory in my infirmities, that the power
[1:17:39] of Christ might rest upon me. Notice
[1:17:43] what he says, and I don't know if I can
[1:17:44] say this. Therefore, I take pleasure in
[1:17:47] infirmities and in reproaches, in
[1:17:50] necessities, and persecutions, and in
[1:17:53] distresses for Christ's sake. For when I
[1:17:56] am weak,
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; then I am strong.
[1:18:02] Hallelujah.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; I'd like to just take you just for a
[1:18:07] second here.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; I can only imagine watching Abraham
[1:18:16] walking up the hill with Isaac.
[1:18:22] God told him to take his son, his only
[1:18:25] son,
[1:18:27] and sacrifice him.
[1:18:34] He didn't talk to Sarah.
[1:18:37] He didn't even tell Isaac what was
[1:18:39] getting ready to happen today.
[1:18:46] But he had confidence in God.
[1:18:50] That's where we got to be at
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; is to have confidence in God.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And do you remember what God said? Thy
[1:18:58] seed
[1:19:01] shall possess the gates of their enemy.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; And remember God had taken him out maybe
[1:19:08] in the daytime and said, "CAN YOU COUNT
[1:19:11] THE SANDS of the sea?
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; No way can you do that.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; SO SHALL THY SEED BE." AMEN.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Maybe in a night a beautiful
[1:19:25] pollutionfree
[1:19:27] night to where the stars are just
[1:19:30] shining SO BRIGHTLY, GOD'S HAVING A
[1:19:33] CONFR conference
[1:19:35] with him and he says,"Abraham,
[1:19:40] can't you count the stars in the sky?
[1:19:45] I can just imagine
[1:19:48] him kind of taking his hands like this
[1:19:50] and looking up.
[1:19:52] One, two, three, four, five.
[1:19:56] Just in his hands like that.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Maybe count a hundred with that which he
[1:20:02] could see just in this little span
[1:20:05] because there's where a lot of people
[1:20:07] have. They're just looking in a little
[1:20:08] block.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:13] Are you with me now?
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; It's this, you know, the world is just
[1:20:17] not you.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we just have to get over
[1:20:22] oursel.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Take a take a a pin, a hat pin. You
[1:20:27] know, those ladies used to wear hat
[1:20:29] pins. And if you could pull that hat pin
[1:20:32] out about that long, they stick one of
[1:20:35] them in my back once in a while. And you
[1:20:37] just you just take that and
[1:20:40] pop yourself a little bit
[1:20:43] and let the air go [clears throat] out.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Some people look real big. What they
[1:20:49] need is a hot pin.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Turn to your neighbor. Say, "Are you
[1:20:59] getting this?"
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Don't tell them this is for you. That
[1:21:03] might make them mad.
[1:21:09] Definitely don't tell your wife. Don't
[1:21:11] tell her.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; And Abraham could look at the stars and
[1:21:17] look at the sand AND REMEMBER MELZDC
[1:21:20] SAYING IT. LIFT THE EAR TO HIM.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; NOW GOD GIVES HIM HIS greatest test. You
[1:21:28] know, sometimes you come to that that
[1:21:30] test and GIVES HIM A TEST TO WHERE THAT
[1:21:34] HE'S GOT TO make a decision. NOW, IT'S
[1:21:36] NOT GOD MAKING a decision. It's I'm
[1:21:39] trusting you. I'm going to see. Do you
[1:21:42] trust me?
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to find it out. I've been
[1:21:45] doing all this for you. NOW, DO YOU
[1:21:47] TRUST ME? TAKE YOUR SON, your only son.
[1:21:51] You're talking about a dark hour.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; You're talking about a dark spot.
[1:21:58] AND HE'S CARRYING HE'S CARRYING THE WOOD
[1:22:02] AND HE'S GOT THE FIRE. ARE YOU WITH ME
[1:22:04] NOW?
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; But he don't have a sacrifice.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's what a lot of churches
[1:22:11] is. We got music. We got musicians. We
[1:22:15] got a preacher.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; BUT WE DON'T HAVE A LIVING JESUS among
[1:22:19] them.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; COME ON. YOU got to have an experience.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO KNOW HIM FOR YOURSELF.
[1:22:28] THIS IS MORE THAN JUST HAVING a
[1:22:30] community of people AND ASSOCIATION
[1:22:33] TOGETHER AND FRIENDSHIPS. WE NEED A
[1:22:35] LIVING GOD.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; A living God. [applause]
[1:22:42] A GOD THAT'S ON THE SCENE ON MONDAY
[1:22:46] MORNING, TUESDAY.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; When you're rolling in a jeep, you need
[1:22:52] a living God.
[1:22:55] When a when a when a big old
[1:22:58] [snorts] HIGHWAY TRUCK IS COMING DOWN
[1:23:00] THE ROAD BOWING DOWN ON YOU NEED A
[1:23:02] LIVING GOD.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; It goes beyond pretend.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; It goes beyond all of that.
[1:23:21] goes beyond having an actor's mask on.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; A lot of people can serve God when
[1:23:27] everything's going good.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; BUT CAN I TRUST YOU?
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; IN THE DARK TIMES,
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE TRIALS COME,
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE VALLEY COMES,
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; CUZ THERE'S WHERE THE TREASURE IS AT.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Stay with me.
[1:23:53] Father,
[1:23:54] we have wood
[1:23:56] and we have fire,
[1:24:00] but we don't have a a sacrifice.
[1:24:04] And he began to speak.
[1:24:07] God [snorts]
[1:24:10] will be our sacrifice.
[1:24:13] He'll provide.
[1:24:17] Now
[1:24:18] everything is built on that hillside.
[1:24:23] Isaiah was Isaac was quite a guy.
[1:24:27] No doubt he was a late teenager,
[1:24:30] strong.
[1:24:34] It wasn't just Abraham, but now it's
[1:24:36] Isaac's turn.
[1:24:38] And he was obedient.
[1:24:45] He was obedient to allow himself
[1:24:49] to be the sacrifice of today.
[1:24:53] But I want you to just notice and maybe
[1:24:55] you've never heard it like this. Abraham
[1:24:57] had repeated Melzdc's words to Isaac.
[1:25:05] He had looked at the same stars. He had
[1:25:07] looked the same sand.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he knew he was the one that
[1:25:12] that seed had to pass through.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. LET ME JUST SAY WHAT
[1:25:18] ABRAHAM BELIEVED.
[1:25:21] HE BELIEVED IF I SACRIFICE HIS BEFORE
[1:25:23] GOD, GOD WILL RAISE HIM RIGHT BACK UP.
[1:25:28] [applause]
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. I say this to you
[1:25:32] tonight. IF YOU'LL LAY YOURSELF ON THE
[1:25:34] ALTAR
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; AND DIE OUT TO YOURSELF, HE'LL RAISE YOU
[1:25:39] RIGHT BACK UP.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; God allows pressures.
[1:25:50] He allows circumstances over life.
[1:25:54] AND SOMETIMES LIFE WILL blindside you.
[1:26:04] Brother Aram says in Speak to the Rock,
[1:26:06] he says,
[1:26:09] "But you know that's the way that God
[1:26:12] leads us, isn't it?
[1:26:15] Some through the water,
[1:26:18] through the floods,
[1:26:21] some through deep trials, but all
[1:26:23] through the blood."
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:26:28] through every briar patch
[1:26:33] and temptation.
[1:26:35] His grace has brought me safe thus far,
[1:26:39] and grace shall take me on
[1:26:42] through many dangers, tolls, and snares.
[1:26:45] I have already come. His grace has
[1:26:48] brought me safe this far. It's grace
[1:26:51] that will take me on. I just believe. I
[1:26:55] just believe him.
[1:26:57] I DON'T KNOW WHY WHAT TOMORROW HOLDS.
[1:27:01] I don't know. Here's a prophet. I don't
[1:27:04] know.
[1:27:07] I DON'T KNOW. BUT I KNOW WHO HOES
[1:27:09] TOMORROW,
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; brother Ron. But
[1:27:16] it was horrible that God would allow
[1:27:20] Brother Brandham to lose his baby girl
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; and WATCH HER SUFFER SO BAD
[1:27:28] UNTIL HER EYES WOULD CROSS BEFORE she
[1:27:30] died. But you don't know what that did
[1:27:33] to a prophet.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; You don't know what that did to a
[1:27:37] prophet.
[1:27:38] And the devil's whispering in his ear,
[1:27:40] "God don't care for you. God don't love
[1:27:43] you." And he said, "JUST WHEN I WAS
[1:27:45] GETTING READY TO GIVE UP, SOMETHING TOOK
[1:27:47] A HOPE."
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; THERE'LL BE TIMES THAT YOU THINK, "I
[1:27:51] CAN'T MAKE IT ANOTHER DAY." AND
[1:27:52] SOMETHING TAKES A HOPE.
[1:27:56] [applause]
[1:28:02] [applause]
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Rand, I'm standing there. No
[1:28:06] doubt THE DEVIL IS LAUGHING. HIS KINGDOM
[1:28:08] IS ON FIRE.
[1:28:11] HE DON'T REALIZE WHAT'S HAPPENING.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; That baby dying and it's crosseyed.
[1:28:17] But that WOULD THAT WOULD INK SOMETHING
[1:28:19] AND SCAR SOMETHING IN BROTHER Brandham's
[1:28:22] own nature
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; TO WHERE EVERY CROSSEYED BABY THAT WOULD
[1:28:26] COME ACROSS THE PLATFORM. EVERY ONE OF
[1:28:29] THEM were healed.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY EVERY [screaming] ONE OF THEM
[1:28:35] WERE HEALED.
[1:28:38] Brother Chris, even the PROPHET WOULD
[1:28:40] SAY, "SOME OF THEM I NEVER PRAYED FOR. I
[1:28:43] JUST GOT HIM TO LOOK INTO MY EYES."
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; GOD CREATED SUCH A FAITH.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; YOUR SCARS THAT YOU GO THROUGH,
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; the enemy don't know what he's doing,
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S TREASURES IN THE DARKNESS.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; COME [screaming] ON, CHURCH. IT MAKES
[1:29:06] YOU STRONGER.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Caesar would say he would like somebody
[1:29:18] to ride with him in his chariot.
[1:29:22] Brother Brandon would tell the story
[1:29:26] how that all the great generals got
[1:29:29] themselves ready and their plumes ready
[1:29:31] and every all the polished their armor.
[1:29:35] They were all out there
[1:29:38] standing
[1:29:41] and Caesar goes down through them
[1:29:43] looking and he comes to a little guy
[1:29:46] there that's got scars all over him.
[1:29:50] He don't have all that nice armor and
[1:29:53] he's standing there.
[1:29:56] Caesar stops.
[1:29:58] How'd you get those scars?
[1:30:01] Fighting for you, Lord.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:04] fighting you, Lord Caesar.
[1:30:07] He said, "Today
[1:30:09] you'll ride with me."
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; He's not looking for Hollywood soldiers.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; He's looking for men and women of the
[1:30:18] cross.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE HE COULD find some here today.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, I don't know, brother
[1:30:27] Honor. My walk of life. WELL, WHY DON'T
[1:30:28] YOU LOOK BACK WHERE YOU STARTED?
[1:30:32] WHY DON'T YOU LOOK WHERE YOU ARE?
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOING?
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; I'M FOCUSED ON A CHAIR
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; SITTING AT THE MARRIAGE SUPPER OF THE
[1:30:42] LAMB. IT'S MY CHAIR.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; NOBODY CAN TAKE MY PLACE.
[1:30:48] [applause]
[1:30:54] [applause]
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid I'll go to hell. Listen, if
[1:30:59] you got one ounce of GOD IN YOU, ONE
[1:31:02] OUNCE, GOD IS NOT GOING TO SEND THAT ONE
[1:31:05] OUNCE TO HELL
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S A PART OF HIMSELF.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S NOT SENDING HIMSELF TO HELL.
[1:31:12] HE'S ALREADY WENT THERE AND CONQUERED
[1:31:15] [screaming]
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; AND OVERCOME DEATH, HELL, AND THE GRAVE.
[1:31:20] WE ARE his victory. [applause]
[1:31:31] We're looking at a new year. It's
[1:31:33] getting ready to flip. The season's
[1:31:34] getting ready to flip. Sun's went
[1:31:37] around. The moon's went around. The
[1:31:39] whatever that is goes around and makes a
[1:31:41] cycle.
[1:31:44] I'm not an astrologer, neither
[1:31:45] pretending to be this morning. But we've
[1:31:48] come to another year. Another year to
[1:31:51] where we can stop and look back at this
[1:31:53] last year. the things that have went on,
[1:31:56] the accomplishments that's been made.
[1:31:58] Some of you've made incredible strides,
[1:32:00] but let's not look back.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Let's not let's not lay on our laurels
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; and say, "I I've got enough." As brother
[1:32:11] Andrew was saying, and I hope you got
[1:32:13] it.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; I want more.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; I WANT [screaming] MORE.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SURRENDER MORE TO HIM. I WANT
[1:32:24] HIM TO FILL MY LIFE,
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; fill my family.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; We have a table that sits
[1:32:36] well, I don't know, 14, 18 chairs.
[1:32:40] It's a long table.
[1:32:43] My grandchildren sit there. Sister Nancy
[1:32:45] sits there.
[1:32:47] My children sits there.
[1:32:52] There's never been an argument at that
[1:32:54] table. That's pretty phenomenal, ain't
[1:32:56] it? Listen, this message works.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; And I was sitting there the other day
[1:33:02] looking at my family and I said, "Oh,
[1:33:05] God,
[1:33:07] I don't want one of them to be lost."
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Would you stop and think about that just
[1:33:15] for a moment about your family?
[1:33:18] Amen.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; I don't want one of them to be lost.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; I can't imagine a table to where that
[1:33:27] half of them are lost
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; without God.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Listen, heaven's not heaven like that.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; If you got CHILDREN LOST, DON'T BE
[1:33:39] SATISFIED with no matter what kind of
[1:33:41] job they have.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; They're making MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
[1:33:44] WHAT'S THAT?
[1:33:46] BIGGEST HOUSE IN OUR COMMUNITY. WHAT'S
[1:33:48] THAT?
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; DRIVING THE BEST CAR IN THE WORLD.
[1:33:52] WHAT'S THAT?
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; MARRIED TO MISS AMERICA? WHAT'S THAT?
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE IN THIS WORLD,
[1:34:04] THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; We should never be comfortable here.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Come on. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING WORTH STAYING HERE FOR.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; But brother Rhonda, BROTHER RAM'S BEEN
[1:34:20] GONE 60 YEARS. WHAT'S THAT [screaming]
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; IN A SPACE OF ETERNITY? WHAT'S 60 YEARS?
[1:34:41] OKAY.
[1:34:43] I'll just share something been on my
[1:34:44] heart.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; You got a microphone? Yeah. I just want
[1:34:50] to use it as a prop.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; It's not on. Okay.
[1:34:58] Let's Let's go to judgment day
[1:35:03] and walk through the line at judgment
[1:35:06] day. Amen.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; If we could just kind of interview.
[1:35:13] We're doing an interview. You know,
[1:35:15] that's what they do in the world. They
[1:35:16] want to put a microphone in front of
[1:35:18] their faces,
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; you know, unprompted. And you give an
[1:35:21] answer.
[1:35:23] Well, why are you here?
[1:35:26] Well, I I was in Hollywood. I was a
[1:35:28] star.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; What's that?
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Maybe you come to Bill Gates.
[1:35:38] Well, I gave most of my salary away.
[1:35:39] Even
[1:35:41] even at the end of my life, I'm I'm
[1:35:43] going to give it all away.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; I was a incredibly smart man.
[1:35:52] What's that?
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Come to a lady and you go, "All right,
[1:36:00] who are you?" I was Miss America.
[1:36:04] I showed my body to the whole world.
[1:36:10] Where was your preacher at?
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Where was your preacher at that that
[1:36:15] warned you'd
[1:36:17] be responsible?
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Let me just say you you need a preacher
[1:36:22] that'll tell you.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; You need a preacher that'll tell you.
[1:36:27] [applause]
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Dress like a lady. Cover your legs up.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Don't cut your hair.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S CUTTING HAIR? IT'S A sign of of
[1:36:45] refusing headship.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; And listen, NOT JUST YOUR HUSBAND,
[1:36:50] CHRIST.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Those things put you in the judgment
[1:36:56] line.
[1:36:59] Amen.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Greatest sports stars.
[1:37:06] What's this? Tiger Woods.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Listen, if you die and you're the
[1:37:11] greatest golfer in the world and you die
[1:37:14] without Jesus Christ,
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; remember that quote about eternal life?
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; The woman died this yesterday.
[1:37:32] Hollywood star,
[1:37:35] sex symbol. She died yesterday. She
[1:37:38] knows where she's at now.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; She may have been worshiped on this
[1:37:42] world, but she knows where she's at.
[1:37:45] Marilyn Monroe, she knows where she's at
[1:37:48] now.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to come real close to
[1:37:52] your heart.
[1:37:54] You walk up to the next one and it goes,
[1:37:57] "What did you do in life? What did you
[1:38:00] do to deserve?"
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; What did you do in deserve to be in this
[1:38:05] line? I rejected Jesus.
[1:38:09] I was standing there throwing stones at
[1:38:11] him.
[1:38:15] Listen, you could have been a phenomenal
[1:38:17] businessman and owned a block in the
[1:38:19] city, but one day you throw a stone at
[1:38:22] Jesus. Uhoh. Come on.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; You'll be remembered for that in
[1:38:26] eternity.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; What did you do?
[1:38:35] I mocked Brother Brandham.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; I mocked him.
[1:38:41] I mocked Brother Ron.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; I mocked the preachers of the message.
[1:38:48] Oh, it made you feel good for a day.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; And you found some people that would
[1:38:54] agree with you,
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; but there's no friends in hell.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Listen, this is individual affair,
[1:39:02] brother, but I'm I'm watching you by the
[1:39:04] internet and that's OFFENDING ME. GET
[1:39:06] RIGHT WITH GOD. [screaming]
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; I'M SAYING IT. GET RIGHT WITH GOD.
[1:39:12] [applause]
[1:39:15] I'm giving YOU A CHANCE.
[1:39:18] WHEN YOU DIE, YOU DON'T HAVE ANOTHER
[1:39:20] CHANCE.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; It'll be some of them that'll have a
[1:39:28] hypocritical preacher
[1:39:31] that'll stand at their at their at their
[1:39:34] funeral and say a lot of good words, but
[1:39:37] they won't stand THERE AND SAY, "THIS
[1:39:39] person mocked the message.
[1:39:50] Listen. And if you've got friends that
[1:39:51] did that, you keep them far away.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; You keep them at extremely
[1:40:00] arms length.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; I don't have them kind of friends. I'm
[1:40:09] honest with you. My prayer is they get
[1:40:12] right with God.
[1:40:14] But I don't let darkness into my world.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; What do those type of people become?
[1:40:31] Haunted houses.
[1:40:35] They become haunted houses. Because
[1:40:37] after a while, you turn against the
[1:40:39] prophet, then you turn against the
[1:40:42] preachers, then you turn against the
[1:40:44] Bible.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Then you got to have a Bible that suits
[1:40:48] you. Then you become an atheist.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; That's kind of like HAVING PORNOGRAPHY
[1:40:55] AS A HABIT.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; BEFORE LONG, IT'S NOT JUST ANOTHER
[1:40:59] WOMAN.
[1:41:01] Then it becomes a man
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SIN DON'T HAVE A BOTTOM.
[1:41:07] [applause]
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; IT DON'T HAVE A BOTTOM TO IT. THERE'S NO
[1:41:13] SATISFACTION
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; to sin.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going TO GO LIVE MY LIFE. GO AHEAD.
[1:41:23] THAT'S YOUR CHOICE.
[1:41:31] Where will the rich young ruler be at?
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Where will Frank Sinatra and Elvis
[1:41:40] Presley be at when they sang the song, I
[1:41:43] did it my way? Hey, you can be cocky
[1:41:46] here.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; You can be cocky here and say, I did it
[1:41:50] my way. Nobody could tell me what to do.
[1:41:52] I don't need nobody.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; You need Jesus.
[1:41:57] Let me be let me let this 5 foot five
[1:42:00] preacher look you in the eyes today. You
[1:42:02] need Jesus.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; And you NEED ENOUGH HUMILITY ABOUT YOU
[1:42:07] TO SAY, "GOD, FORGIVE ME.
[1:42:11] [applause]
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; GOD, FORGIVE me
[1:42:16] if I GOT TO CRAWL ON MY HANDS AND KNEES.
[1:42:18] GOD FORGIVE ME. [applause]
[1:42:36] DIFFICULTY.
[1:42:37] SURE, people in the world have
[1:42:39] difficulties
[1:42:41] and sometimes they overcome. We read
[1:42:44] about Beethoven that lost his hearing,
[1:42:48] but that didn't stop him. Amen.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; He saw it off his piano so he could
[1:42:54] hear. Put his ear on the floor
[1:42:57] and he became known as one of the
[1:42:59] greatest writers that ever lived.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; There was a man
[1:43:05] There was a man. Can I give you a couple
[1:43:07] of these?
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; There was a man that had a restaurant.
[1:43:12] You know, there's some circumstances you
[1:43:13] don't have nothing to do with.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be living a perfectly good
[1:43:18] life and be blindsided by life. There
[1:43:20] was a man that had a restaurant. IT WAS
[1:43:23] A PROSPEROUS restaurant
[1:43:26] and they built a interstate by there and
[1:43:30] nobody stopped at his restaurant no
[1:43:31] more. [snorts] So he began to take his
[1:43:34] food, put it in the back end of his
[1:43:36] station wagon and take it to to to uh
[1:43:39] different different FACILITIES AND WOULD
[1:43:43] SELL HIS FOOD.
[1:43:48] LISTEN,
[1:43:49] he's now getting ready to retire. He's
[1:43:52] 65 years old. But he wasn't WANTING TO
[1:43:55] QUIT.
[1:43:58] HE TOOK HIS chicken
[1:44:01] to all of America.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; ALL OF CANADA, ALL OF CHINA.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; No matter what missionary work YOU CAN
[1:44:10] DO, THERE'S COLONEL SANDERS FACE THERE.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; IN THE DARKNESS OF A INTERSTATE BEING
[1:44:19] BUILT IN FRONT OF HIM,
[1:44:21] HE FOUND TREASURE.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; There was a young man fell in a fire
[1:44:36] where they took him to the hospital.
[1:44:40] The doctors in attendance said, "We're
[1:44:42] going to have to cut his legs off."
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; And his mama said, "No, we can't cut his
[1:44:46] legs off. No, no, no, no, no." He
[1:44:48] pleaded, "Don't cut my legs off."
[1:44:51] He was burnt so bad till his use of his
[1:44:53] legs was gone.
[1:44:56] They become useless limbs.
[1:45:00] He was set in a wheelchair and couldn't
[1:45:02] wiggle his toes.
[1:45:05] They would roll him out in the yard and
[1:45:07] he'd watch children playing and going by
[1:45:11] and he would ask them, "Push me up to
[1:45:14] the fence." Picket fence.
[1:45:17] pushed me up to the fence
[1:45:23] and one day he got enough grit to grab a
[1:45:26] hold of the fence. I hope I'm talking to
[1:45:29] people that'll grab the fence right now.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; I don't know where you are in life, but
[1:45:34] get enough gumption to grab a hold of
[1:45:36] the fence.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; AND HE PULLED HIMSELF UP.
[1:45:42] Oh man.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:45] Day after day, he would stand there
[1:45:47] standing on his feet, which was an
[1:45:49] impossibility.
[1:45:51] And one day, Teddy, he took a step.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Then he began to take more steps.
[1:46:01] And it was a dream that it could go all
[1:46:04] the way to the end of the yard,
[1:46:08] one
[1:46:09] step at a time.
[1:46:13] Sometimes you've got to take some steps.
[1:46:14] BUT BROTHER, I'M FELL DOWN. GET UP.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; I'M AFRAID I CAN'T MAKE IT. PUT ONE FOOT
[1:46:22] IN FRONT OF ANOTHER.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT HERE TO JUDGE YOU. WE'RE HERE
[1:46:26] TO ENCOURAGE YOU.
[1:46:32] [applause]
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; LAY YOUR ROCKS DOWN OUTSIDE. WE DON'T
[1:46:38] NEED PEOPLE THROWING ROCKS HERE. WE
[1:46:40] DON'T NEED A GOSSIP PARTER HERE. WE'RE
[1:46:42] HERE AS a team. WE'RE HERE AS A BODY. WE
[1:46:46] NEED ONE ANOTHER.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; That young man not only went to the end
[1:46:53] of the fence, but became an Olympic
[1:46:57] runner.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE FIRST MAN, NOW THINK OF THE
[1:47:01] IMPOSSIBILITY. HE WAS THE FIRST man
[1:47:05] to run a four-minute mile in the
[1:47:08] Olympics. Amen.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a lot of times people
[1:47:12] see your face, but they don't know your
[1:47:14] story. You need to you need to clap your
[1:47:16] hands right there. They see your face,
[1:47:18] but they don't know your story.
[1:47:21] [applause]
[1:47:27] [applause]
[1:47:27] You see brother Shannon's face, but you
[1:47:29] don't know his story.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; COME ON. YOU SEE ONE ANOTHER, BUT YOU
[1:47:35] DON'T KNOW THE STORY.
[1:47:37] THERE'S A LOT OF CHAPTERS IN THE BOOK
[1:47:38] YOU'D LIKE TO FORGET, BUT THE BLOOD OF
[1:47:41] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:47:50] [snorts]
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Why do I have to go through so many dark
[1:47:56] places?
[1:47:58] There's treasure there.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; There's treasure there.
[1:48:07] And I finish
[1:48:10] in the last six years.
[1:48:13] I understand treasure.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; And I want to ask you as an audience,
[1:48:27] have you appreciated the diamonds?
[1:48:35] Have you appreciated the diamonds
[1:48:39] that we found?
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Sister Wanda,
[1:48:46] you went through a horrible thing,
[1:48:49] but you looked at some treasure.
[1:48:54] If God helped him to do it,
[1:48:57] I can do it.
[1:49:00] You may not be here next week, but I'm
[1:49:02] I'm going to speak about 20 30 minutes
[1:49:06] in our in our services.
[1:49:10] The girl you married is your sister in
[1:49:13] the Lord.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; She's also a part of you.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; She's a part of you.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Your marriage should get better every
[1:49:24] day. Amen.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Every day fellowship with your children
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; should be a bond. Your grandchildren a
[1:49:35] bond.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Alli's not here today, but Ally makes my
[1:49:41] heart do things that
[1:49:44] Isaac. Isaac and Zoe back there. She's
[1:49:48] full of spark.
[1:49:50] And if you get a hug from her, you
[1:49:53] better get a trophy out.
[1:49:57] cuz there's days she likes you and
[1:49:59] there's days that you know what you're
[1:50:01] saying. You know
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; it's worth life is worth living.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Roger understands that now
[1:50:15] because he's fighting for the last bit
[1:50:18] of his life.
[1:50:20] But he can look back and here's where
[1:50:22] I'm going. He can look back on the
[1:50:26] treasures that he laid up.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Don't wait till your deathbed.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; DON'T PARTY ALL YOUR LIFE.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; DON'T DRUGG ALL YOUR LIFE.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; TODAY IS THE DAY.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; TODAY IS THE DAY TO SERVE GOD AND COMMIT
[1:50:48] TO GOD and surrender TO GOD.
[1:50:54] DON'T FUSS AND FIGHT WITH YOUR WIFE AND
[1:50:56] YOUR CHILDREN.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; YOUR HOME IS A SANCTUARY WHERE GOD WANTS
[1:51:00] TO LIVE AT.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Recently
[1:51:14] I heard about
[1:51:17] it wasn't here. Thank God
[1:51:20] about children being so distressed
[1:51:22] because their Christian mom and dad
[1:51:24] fought
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; like cats and dogs.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; I'll be honest. I'm just gonna I'm just
[1:51:34] going to share my heart. Here we are.
[1:51:40] I thought about that. I couldn't go to
[1:51:42] sleep that night. Connie will tell you
[1:51:45] when I heard that, I couldn't go to
[1:51:48] sleep. I'm thinking about Christians
[1:51:50] that are that have been Christians for
[1:51:52] 50 years
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; and they fight to like two, these were
[1:51:58] the words, two dogs
[1:52:01] RAGING TO TRYING TO KILL ONE ANOTHER.
[1:52:06] It should not be so.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; It should NEVER I WANT TO SAY NEVER BE
[1:52:16] SO IN YOUR HOME or in your life.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE ABOUT BISCUITS. I DON'T
[1:52:22] CARE ABOUT MONEY.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME?
[1:52:29] [screaming]
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE ABOUT WHATEVER'S GOING ON
[1:52:31] IN YOUR TEMPORAL LIFE.
[1:52:39] If they're listening, I want to tell
[1:52:41] them, stop.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Stop.
[1:52:48] Why? Why are you concerned about that,
[1:52:49] Brother Ron? We're going to a land
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; where there will be none of that.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; And you can't be that way here
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; and be that way there.
[1:53:03] All that's free. I quit a few minutes
[1:53:05] ago when the lights went out.
[1:53:08] Now the devil's mad that the lights went
[1:53:10] came back on.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Let's stand and sing on the wings of a
[1:53:14] snow white dove. Sister Cassie,
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord.

[1:53:19] last verse. Sister Crystal,

[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I stepped on you stepped on
[1:53:41] my toes this morning. Hey,

[1:53:48] there.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that. Let's sing that
[1:53:54] first verse together today.

[1:54:03] on the flood. Many days [singing]
[1:54:09] he searched for land [singing]
[1:54:15] in various
[1:54:18] ways.
[1:54:22] Troubles he had
[1:54:26] sunk [music]
[1:54:28] but not from [singing]

[1:56:52] This is the last service you'll be in
[1:56:55] this year. Here
[1:57:03] you can look back.
[1:57:07] We always do that.
[1:57:11] But what about us looking forward today?
[1:57:14] What about looking forward?
[1:57:20] Maybe you're praying for revival in your
[1:57:22] heart.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Praying for loved ones in your family.
[1:57:26] [music]
[1:57:28] Jobs situation.
[1:57:32] More than anything, we want more of God.
[1:57:40] Brother, I've been a Christian a long
[1:57:42] time.
[1:57:44] Do you ever remember what the angel told
[1:57:46] brother Brandham?
[1:57:48] Be more sincere.
[1:57:52] Let me let [music] me just let me just
[1:57:54] qualify that statement.
[1:57:58] The prophet of God had seen the greatest
[1:58:01] miracles ever performed on this earth.
[1:58:08] And I don't have to list them [music]
[1:58:10] off.
[1:58:12] Dead raised people step out [music] of
[1:58:14] wheelchairs.
[1:58:16] Cancers drop off.
[1:58:19] Eyes, ears, [music]
[1:58:23] legs extended,
[1:58:26] prodals coming home.
[1:58:31] He'd walk with the angel of the Lord.
[1:58:34] You know, I think sometimes we think
[1:58:36] we're walking with the angel, but to
[1:58:38] know
[1:58:40] even to know at a certain time that
[1:58:42] brother [music] Brandon said
[1:58:45] offended the angel.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; I wonder sometimes if our life offends
[1:58:52] [music] him
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; and at a deep prayer, I quoted this to
[1:58:57] sister Connie this morning. Brother
[1:58:59] Brandham said, as I heard him say it
[1:59:02] this morning, he said, [music] "It is a
[1:59:04] sin to say a prayer,
[1:59:10] even quote a prayer."
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "You [music] got to pray a
[1:59:15] prayer."
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "You could study
[1:59:22] for hours [snorts]
[1:59:23] of what to say in your prayer."
[1:59:26] He said, "But you got to cry out to God.
[1:59:30] You got to cry out to God."
[1:59:34] Now, if we could in this last service
[1:59:36] before [music]
[1:59:36] going into the next year,
[1:59:39] if we could look deep inside of
[1:59:41] ourselves and say, "God, I want you to
[1:59:43] help me.
[1:59:45] I need help.
[1:59:48] I need help."
[1:59:54] I wrote these words to brother Donnie
[1:59:56] and brother Tim this morning, my
[1:59:58] buddies, bosom buddies.
[2:00:03] I said, "Fellas, sometimes life is
[2:00:05] [music] just overwhelming.
[2:00:08] Listen, I don't know what we would do
[2:00:10] without God.
[2:00:12] I don't know what we would do. But if I
[2:00:14] got God on my side,
[2:00:17] I can go through anything.
[2:00:23] Maybe if you take your wife's hand now
[2:00:24] and children's hand if they're close.
[2:00:28] Guys, it's okay to take one another's
[2:00:30] hand. Ain't nobody [music] going to say
[2:00:32] nothing here. Sis, you guys can take one
[2:00:36] another's hand there.
[2:00:42] And I don't want you to ask the Lord,
[2:00:43] Lord, help me.
[2:00:47] Help me that I would be worthy to
[2:00:49] [music] escape those things that are
[2:00:51] that are coming on the earth cuz they're
[2:00:55] coming.
[2:00:57] They're coming.
[2:01:02] Lord Jesus,
[2:01:05] we bow our heads before you.
[2:01:08] Lord, I thank you for the presence that
[2:01:10] we have felt in this building today.
[2:01:15] You're such a wonderful, kind father.
[2:01:18] [music]
[2:01:19] You're so powerful,
[2:01:25] Lord.
[2:01:27] And I think you are so incredible
[2:01:30] to where you can take care of my
[2:01:33] problems
[2:01:34] [music] and yet all the way across the
[2:01:36] world, you can take care of another
[2:01:38] problem. And you can do that universally
[2:01:42] when we call on your name.
[2:01:46] The Lord, no doubt, I could look at the
[2:01:48] failures of this year,
[2:01:51] trials that I've went through.
[2:01:54] I can look at [music] the tests that I
[2:01:56] went through
[2:01:57] and I can honestly say some of them I
[2:02:00] failed.
[2:02:03] But you're a God of grace,
[2:02:06] a God of mercy.
[2:02:09] You're a God of second chances,
[2:02:13] Lord Jesus. Come fill our hearts all
[2:02:16] over this building. [music]
[2:02:18] Let this be a complete building altar
[2:02:20] call.
[2:02:22] LORD, WE CRY OUT TO YOU, FATHER.
[2:02:26] Forgive us of our mistakes.
[2:02:29] Forgive us of our failures.
[2:02:32] Lord, I ask you that you would help us.
[2:02:34] We surrender our lives like never
[2:02:36] before.
[2:02:38] Lord, if there's one thing that I could
[2:02:40] pray, Lord, I need more of your spirit
[2:02:43] living in my life.
[2:02:46] Lord, give us all a personal revival.
[2:02:49] Minister to our hearts in Jesus Christ's
[2:02:53] name I [music] pray. In your name I
[2:02:55] pray.
[2:02:57] Thank you, Father.
[2:02:59] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Could we just
[2:03:02] raise our hands and thank him now?

[2:03:10] snow.

[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Don't take it for granted.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; I want to give you a little exercise. I
[2:04:35] I want you to turn around while we
[2:04:36] dismiss [music] and I want you to shake
[2:04:39] at least 10 people's hands.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; I want you to tell them, [music] "God
[2:04:43] bless you." Cuz you couldn't do a better
[2:04:45] thing than to say, "God bless you."
