[43:00] always a blessing to go but it's an even
[43:03] greater blessing to be able to come back
[43:05] and
[43:06] and uh the lord certainly moved in a
[43:08] very special way there at the meetings
[43:10] there in ohio and
[43:12] we've seen just some supernatural things
[43:15] take place that that only the lord could
[43:17] do and
[43:19] and that's the one that we're
[43:20] fellowshipping with here this evening
[43:22] and i just like to before we go to the
[43:25] word i'd like to just make a mention
[43:28] well let's just read the scripture and
[43:29] i'll let you be seated and then we'll
[43:30] make a few comments on that if that's
[43:32] all right we don't want to leave you

[44:39] young men shall see visions
[44:41] revelations chapter 10
[44:43] and verse 1.
[44:55] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[44:57] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[45:00] rainbow was upon his head
[45:02] and his face was as it were
[45:05] the sun and his feet
[45:08] as pillars of fire may god bless his
[45:10] word he may be seated in the presence of
[45:12] the lord
[45:13] as we said we
[45:15] we certainly are privileged to
[45:17] to be able to stand here and to say that
[45:19] we had a supernatural meeting last week
[45:21] in there at brother ray erickson's their
[45:24] their youth camp there and if you have
[45:25] not seen that you can go and watch that
[45:28] uh on the on the youtube there at true
[45:30] word tabernacle and i believe it will be
[45:32] a great benefit and we just seen some
[45:34] supernatural things take place even in
[45:37] our mo our own youth group here and just
[45:40] very special things that we've been able
[45:42] to be a part of and just one thing that
[45:44] i'd like to make mention to you that we
[45:46] realize that the spirit of the lord is a
[45:49] discerner of the thoughts and the
[45:50] intents of the heart and and it was a
[45:52] real honor to stand there with my my
[45:54] buddy brother tim timothy pruitt and to
[45:57] to watch the spirit of the lord use him
[45:59] and to see what the lord was doing and
[46:01] brother timothy was preaching on friday
[46:03] night
[46:04] on the light the chain breaker and if
[46:06] you listen to it just bear with us but
[46:08] you you are your witness to these things
[46:10] but brother timothy was speaking on the
[46:14] the light the chain breaker and man it
[46:15] was it was just supernatural and the
[46:17] spirit of the lord just come down in a
[46:19] supernatural way there in that service
[46:21] and there there was a prayer line that
[46:23] formed at the at the altar there and
[46:26] every night there was a prayer line
[46:27] basically and
[46:28] the lord really the lord really did some
[46:31] major deliverances and
[46:33] we watched the spirit of the lord fill
[46:35] young people and change their lives and
[46:37] do everything that we ask him to do and
[46:39] while brother timothy brother timothy
[46:41] was in he was in one portion of the
[46:43] prayer line i was in the other and the
[46:44] spirit of the lord began to speak to him
[46:46] go back up there and finish the quote
[46:48] that you were reading and he was he was
[46:50] reading on that quote on you remember
[46:52] when brother branham he talks about he
[46:54] talks about those that were in those
[46:56] chains and they were in those bars there
[46:58] and he said house of hell give way in
[47:00] the name of the lord jesus christ and
[47:02] and brother timothy i wasn't aware what
[47:04] was happening because just where we were
[47:07] but brother timothy began to speak those
[47:09] things and i didn't even realize what
[47:10] was happening but he was standing there
[47:12] and he was preaching he was preaching
[47:14] that thought on he was relaying the rest
[47:17] of that quote there that house of hell
[47:19] give way in the name of jesus christ and
[47:21] you remember in that quote brother
[47:22] burnham said that he said and all of a
[47:24] sudden i heard a cracking and a popping
[47:27] and and and all of them and they began
[47:29] to scream delivered well i wasn't aware
[47:31] exactly what was happening but there was
[47:33] there was a physical change in the
[47:35] building and there were demons that were
[47:37] beginning to run for cover that were
[47:39] running back and forth because the
[47:41] spirit of the living god had broke
[47:43] chains there it was an amazing thing to
[47:45] be a part of and demons were running
[47:47] back and forth and the spirit of the
[47:49] living god was setting his children free
[47:52] my brother timothy had been taken away
[47:54] he'd been taken away from the meeting he
[47:56] was he was wore out and was going out
[47:57] the building he was in the he was on a
[48:00] golf cart with brother ronnie and the
[48:01] spear of the lord told him said you've
[48:03] got another chain to go break and he was
[48:05] already outside of the building but he
[48:07] come back in there and he said the devil
[48:09] has been telling our young girls you can
[48:11] go and listen to it and tell you if i'm
[48:13] telling you the truth he said but the
[48:14] devil's been telling our young girls
[48:16] that they're not beautiful and they're
[48:17] ugly he said but the bible said that you
[48:20] are fearfully and wonderfully made well
[48:23] at that very moment there was a there
[48:25] was a sister that was there praying
[48:27] about these certain things about these
[48:29] complexes and those things said lord if
[48:32] you're for me have brother timothy come
[48:34] back out
[48:36] have brother timothy come back out and
[48:38] speak exactly those things and the
[48:41] spirit of the living god took brother
[48:43] timothy pruitt and used him we'll say
[48:45] this that he is still the discerner of
[48:48] the thoughts and the intents of the
[48:50] heart
[48:51] i tell you we serve a very living god
[48:56] he's amazing it's amazing to be a
[48:58] witness to what we are witnessing right
[49:00] here in this hour and i'd like to speak
[49:02] to you this evening on a part two of
[49:04] what the the lord dealt with us there on
[49:07] on that saturday night on something that
[49:09] he opened unto us that that we hadn't
[49:12] been looking at but specifically for
[49:14] that meeting but the lord has directed
[49:16] us and i'd like to speak to you tonight
[49:18] on when heaven turns loose part two and
[49:20] if you haven't heard part one you can go
[49:22] and listen to it but i'm gonna i'm gonna
[49:23] preach it to you so you're not in left
[49:25] field and you don't know if you haven't
[49:27] listened to it but those that have
[49:29] listened to it i'm not going to preach
[49:30] the same sermon again but yeah and i'm
[49:32] going to hit some points again and so if
[49:34] you hear what i've already said you just
[49:36] know where to say amen at
[49:38] is that all right how many how many was
[49:40] able to listen to that service there
[49:42] all right well praise the lord we'll
[49:44] preach to you i know you were there
[49:47] but we'd like to speak to you tonight on
[49:49] when heaven turns loose revelations 10
[49:51] and 1 and i saw another mighty angel
[49:53] come down from heaven clothed with a
[49:56] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[49:58] and his face was as it were the sun and
[50:01] his feet as pillars of fire verse seven
[50:05] but in the days of the voice of the
[50:07] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[50:09] sound the mystery of god should be
[50:11] finished as he hath declared to his
[50:13] servants the prophets and the voice
[50:15] which i heard from heaven spake unto me
[50:17] again and said go
[50:19] and take the little book which is open
[50:21] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[50:24] upon the sea and upon the earth
[50:26] and i went unto the angel and said unto
[50:28] him give me the little book and he said
[50:30] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[50:32] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[50:34] be in my mouth sweet as honey and i took
[50:37] the little book out of the angel's hand
[50:39] and ate it up and it was in my mouth
[50:41] sweetest honey and as soon as i had
[50:44] eaten it my belly was bitter and he said
[50:46] unto me thou must prophesy again before
[50:49] many peoples nations and tongues and
[50:52] kings now i want you to recognize that
[50:55] we're very aware of where we're living
[50:56] at is as a church of the living god we
[50:59] recognize that what we are seeing in
[51:01] revelations 10 is not just any angel but
[51:04] this is the lord jesus christ that has
[51:07] descended that has descended in what we
[51:09] witnessed up there in sabine canyon that
[51:11] was not jesus but that was the spirit of
[51:14] christ that was descending on the church
[51:16] that was coming to deliver the the seven
[51:19] seals to the church to roll back
[51:22] everything that had held her back of all
[51:24] the creeds and all the dogmas and all
[51:26] the ideas that had been dead had been
[51:28] bound up here the spirit of the living
[51:30] god would work through the ministry of
[51:32] malachi 4 to go in there and to tie back
[51:36] those loose sins all of those things
[51:38] that had been broken off and those
[51:40] things that have been taken and you
[51:41] watch history that history there were
[51:43] men like there were men like wesley and
[51:46] men like luther and they'd work through
[51:48] there but there were things that were
[51:50] still broken up but there the spirit of
[51:52] the living god would prophesy that there
[51:55] we would have a prophet in this
[51:56] generation that it would restore back
[51:59] restore the faith back to the faith of
[52:02] the pentecostal fathers and we recognize
[52:04] tonight that the angel of the covenant
[52:07] is standing right here and is with this
[52:09] message and he's not going to leave this
[52:11] church he's not going to back off of
[52:13] this message but the angel of the lord
[52:16] is the angel of the covenant and he's
[52:18] here with this message and to make sure
[52:20] that this bride makes it all the way in
[52:22] the rapture he's not he's not settled or
[52:25] he's not going with just a halfway of
[52:27] you barely living on overcoming life but
[52:30] the angel of the covenant is here to
[52:32] make sure that you get who you are
[52:35] recognizing who you are in the lord
[52:37] jesus christ recognizing your position
[52:40] in the body of jesus christ and brother
[52:42] branham would tell us that in the last
[52:44] days and that that the spirit of the
[52:46] living god would come and satan would
[52:48] hate the very revelation that this bride
[52:51] is under because it would make her an
[52:53] invincible army and you recognize why
[52:56] all hell is against this message but we
[52:58] recognize that all of heaven is behind
[53:00] this message is that right so we
[53:02] recognize that revelations 10 is our
[53:05] mighty angel which is none other than
[53:07] jesus christ and he's standing right
[53:10] here at the pulpit tonight he's standing
[53:12] right here and if you'll recognize that
[53:14] you're in his presence tonight he will
[53:17] release the power of the holy ghost over
[53:20] your life
[53:24] that's what brother madam said in
[53:25] recognizing or the presence of god
[53:27] unrecognized he said if we could only
[53:29] realize that he is appearing to us in
[53:32] these meetings for one purpose he said
[53:34] that's to release our desires that we
[53:37] have in him and now how you recognize
[53:39] his presence is when the promised word
[53:42] for this age is made manifest and what a
[53:45] powerful thing tonight to recognize that
[53:47] all of your desires that you have in
[53:49] jesus can be released right here when
[53:52] you recognize the very word of god being
[53:55] made manifest right here before you and
[53:57] to think that if you have a desire for
[53:59] healing if it's in christ god will
[54:01] release it to you if you recognize his
[54:04] presence if you have a desire for the
[54:06] baptism of the holy ghost or a
[54:07] furtherance of the kingdom of god or or
[54:10] a closer walk or something specific god
[54:13] will release your desires in your heart
[54:16] if you will set here under the power of
[54:18] the holy ghost and recognize that this
[54:21] is our lord jesus christ that is
[54:23] manifesting himself once again in body
[54:26] flesh i'll say this that the word was
[54:28] made flesh and the word was made flesh
[54:31] and it dwelt amongst us but i'll say
[54:33] this the word was made flesh and the
[54:35] flesh is made word and i'll say that
[54:37] what you are seeing is a body of
[54:39] believers that is operating under the
[54:42] power of the mighty angel she's not just
[54:45] stepping off where she doesn't know
[54:47] she's not stepping off on things that
[54:49] she doesn't understand but she is a
[54:51] people that have had an open book that
[54:53] has been given unto her and all of
[54:55] heaven has come down to show her that
[54:58] heaven is back behind her
[55:02] now we know that william branham told us
[55:04] about that light he told us about that
[55:06] light ever since his birth he was there
[55:08] at his birth we recognized that it was
[55:09] there when he was a little child we
[55:11] recognized he was there in 1933 we
[55:14] recognized that that light followed him
[55:16] and once since for two thousand years
[55:19] the very pillar fire that led the
[55:21] children of israel is back at the church
[55:24] of the living god
[55:28] i want you to know that whatever you
[55:29] have need of he will release to you
[55:32] power to heal power to save power to
[55:35] open up your minds if you'll just
[55:36] recognize that this is him
[55:40] now you remember i'm not i'm not going
[55:42] to quote the whole thing to you but you
[55:43] remember when danny henry was there
[55:45] after brother man after brother branham
[55:47] had stood there at the full gospel
[55:49] businessman and he had preached this
[55:51] powerful message there and danny henry
[55:54] came to him and you know the story but
[55:56] danny henry came to him and he came
[55:58] there and he said brother branham he
[55:59] said your message could be that of
[56:02] revelations 23 he said i don't mean that
[56:04] to sound sacrilegious sacrilegious he
[56:07] said but that could be revelations 23
[56:10] well you know there's only one
[56:11] revelations 22 but he was saying it was
[56:14] so perfectly in line with the bible that
[56:16] it could be that of revelations 23 and
[56:19] you remember what the spirit of the lord
[56:21] when he said that danny henry began to
[56:24] speak in an unknown tongue that he'd
[56:25] never known before and these words were
[56:28] spoke he said because of thy momentous
[56:31] decision a huge portion of heaven will
[56:34] await you now we realize that brother
[56:36] branham is not good brother branham is
[56:37] he is going to be in heaven but we
[56:39] recognize that just because of his
[56:41] momentous decision that he doesn't get a
[56:43] bigger house in heaven he's not getting
[56:46] a bigger mansion in heaven he's not
[56:48] getting a bigger slot in heaven but he
[56:50] was saying that heaven has come down
[56:52] there's a huge portion of heaven that is
[56:55] here in this building tonight and i know
[56:57] this there's some that'll sit here and
[56:59] miss what is happening but i'll say this
[57:01] that heaven is in this building tonight
[57:04] all of heaven is backing up the body of
[57:06] jesus christ and i'll say this as jesus
[57:09] stood there in matthew 28 and 19 that
[57:12] all power in heaven and in earth is
[57:14] given unto me i'll say all of heaven is
[57:17] right here
[57:21] all of heaven is right here
[57:25] hallelujah
[57:26] notice what what what jesus said in
[57:29] matthew 18
[57:30] he said
[57:32] that matthew 18 and 18 he said verily i
[57:34] say unto you that whatsoever you bind on
[57:36] earth shall be bound in heaven and
[57:38] whatsoever you whatsoever you loose on
[57:40] earth shall be loosed in heaven
[57:43] now think about this right here you've
[57:45] got desires in your heart as we've
[57:47] already said you've got things in your
[57:49] life and there's things that are binding
[57:51] you that are holding you back in your
[57:53] own personal walk is that right there's
[57:55] certain little things that you've
[57:56] allowed to creep in steal away your joy
[57:59] and steal away your peace and steal away
[58:01] your actual love for the lord jesus
[58:03] christ but there is power in unity
[58:06] tonight when you come under the anointed
[58:09] word you can stand there
[58:12] as a believer this is jesus's words he
[58:15] said whatsoever you bind on earth i'll
[58:17] bind in heaven and whatsoever you loose
[58:19] on earth i'll loose in heaven i'll say
[58:22] god loose the holy ghost in this place
[58:24] loose healing in this place loose
[58:27] deliverance in this place we've got lost
[58:29] loved ones god we bind them where they
[58:32] are and we lose heaven to go to them
[58:37] [Applause]
[58:43] heaven's here
[58:45] the anointing is here the pillar of fire
[58:47] is here the supernatural almighty god
[58:50] that walked with abraham is here the one
[58:53] that led isaac is here the one that led
[58:55] jacob is here the one that he wrestled
[58:57] with is here the one joseph met in a
[59:00] dungeon is here
[59:03] i know i know it may be a little hard
[59:05] for you to understand but the same angel
[59:07] that william bran a metaphor in that
[59:09] cave is right here
[59:15] whatever you bind on earth will be bound
[59:18] in heaven
[59:20] i was listening the other day on trying
[59:22] to do god a service without being in his
[59:24] will and you go through it is a very
[59:26] powerful service but at the very
[59:27] beginning of that service brother
[59:29] branham brother barron begins to talk
[59:30] about brother richard blair you you've
[59:32] heard him you've heard him talk about it
[59:34] and actually brother homer fraser our
[59:36] former pastor my granddaddy he had
[59:39] something very supernatural happen maybe
[59:41] i'll just i'll just drop that in right
[59:43] here maybe you don't really maybe some
[59:45] of you don't haven't heard this story
[59:47] but one time brother richard blair which
[59:48] was well you'll hear brother adam talk
[59:50] about him many times throughout the
[59:51] message
[59:52] but brother brother homer and brother
[59:54] ronald they were up there at royce
[59:55] shrewsbury's church up there in west
[59:57] virginia and richard blair was sitting
[59:59] there
[1:00:00] and the spirit of the lord fell on gran
[1:00:02] my granddaddy homer fraser and told him
[1:00:05] that before the night's over richard
[1:00:07] blair would die before he got back home
[1:00:11] brother homer went and told brother
[1:00:12] royce roosevelt and that's exactly what
[1:00:14] happened i'll say the spirit of the lord
[1:00:16] is here
[1:00:17] it wasn't nothing it was just it was
[1:00:19] simply that god was showing showing that
[1:00:21] there's still gifts
[1:00:23] in the body he was still showing us that
[1:00:26] heaven is backing up but but but to get
[1:00:28] back to the story here but richard blair
[1:00:33] richard blair excuse me richard blair
[1:00:35] had he was helping a brother and he was
[1:00:37] wiring up a trailer and they had
[1:00:39] reversed they had reversed some things
[1:00:41] when they were wiring it up and when
[1:00:42] they reversed it it sent an electrical
[1:00:45] shock back into the water where there
[1:00:47] was a little boy back there that was
[1:00:48] playing back here that was playing and
[1:00:51] that richard blair he said i couldn't
[1:00:53] get a hold of brother madam he said but
[1:00:55] i remembered what matthew 18 and 20 said
[1:00:58] that
[1:00:59] that whatsoever you bind on earth i bind
[1:01:01] in heaven and where two or three are
[1:01:03] gathered in my name there i will be in
[1:01:05] the midst of them and to think that
[1:01:07] right there that man that little boy
[1:01:09] that had died by that electrical shock
[1:01:11] and his stomach had blown up and all of
[1:01:13] these things because of that electrical
[1:01:15] shock he was completely dead he said but
[1:01:18] i remembered what you s what the bible
[1:01:21] said
[1:01:22] that i'll be there in the midst of them
[1:01:25] and because he remembered what the
[1:01:27] scripture said heaven was loosed and
[1:01:30] that little boy had come back to life
[1:01:33] brother branham said it was a blessed
[1:01:34] thing for that man to believe that
[1:01:36] because he got his son back and i'll say
[1:01:38] this you're blessed tonight to believe
[1:01:40] that i am in the midst of the church of
[1:01:43] the living god
[1:01:45] i'm telling you that whatever you have
[1:01:47] need of ask and you shall receive
[1:01:51] i'm telling you you ain't gonna be
[1:01:52] afraid to ask small things and you ain't
[1:01:54] gonna be afraid to ask big things ask
[1:01:57] big things ask that your joy might be
[1:01:59] full
[1:02:03] i don't believe it's too hard to ask for
[1:02:05] a house i don't believe it's too hard to
[1:02:07] ask for a job i don't believe it's too
[1:02:09] hard to ask for this or ask for that if
[1:02:12] you ask and your desire's right and your
[1:02:14] motive's right and all of heaven gets
[1:02:16] behind it i'll say heaven will open up
[1:02:20] and pour out a blessing that you won't
[1:02:22] be able to understand
[1:02:24] [Applause]
[1:02:27] what was it
[1:02:29] richard blair was a lived voice and
[1:02:31] that's what brother branham said is that
[1:02:33] what we need
[1:02:34] is oh what we need in jeffersonville is
[1:02:37] thousands of live voices
[1:02:39] he said that's the thunder he said
[1:02:41] that's the thunder of god thundering out
[1:02:43] in sweetness and holiness and purity
[1:02:46] undefiled lives walking around the earth
[1:02:48] today without a blemish yes sir real
[1:02:50] christian he said that's the thunder
[1:02:53] against the enemy the devil don't care
[1:02:55] how loud you can holler the devil don't
[1:02:57] care how much you can jump or how much
[1:02:59] you can how much you can do this or
[1:03:00] shout he said but what hurts the devil
[1:03:04] now i'm going to tell you what there's
[1:03:05] one thing i like finding out is what
[1:03:07] hurts the death
[1:03:11] hallelujah i'm going to drop it to you a
[1:03:12] little bit later maybe on but brother
[1:03:14] branham said it's a death stroke to
[1:03:15] satan when man takes god at his word
[1:03:19] he said it's the hardest hitting that
[1:03:21] satan can ever get it's when man takes
[1:03:23] god at his word i'll say this if joshua
[1:03:26] could stand there and stop the son and
[1:03:29] didn't have the baptism of the holy
[1:03:31] ghost what i like me to do as a church
[1:03:34] of the living god who have his voice the
[1:03:36] voice of resurrection is in the body
[1:03:39] let's hurt satan tonight
[1:03:41] let's turn hell on notice we have come
[1:03:44] to take over

[1:03:54] they pushed us around all our life they
[1:03:56] pushed you around all your life let's
[1:03:58] start pushing hell back with all of
[1:04:01] heaven
[1:04:02] you're not doing this on your own you
[1:04:04] are a people that are sitting here under
[1:04:07] the auspices of the holy ghost
[1:04:13] push them back don't let them push you
[1:04:16] push them back
[1:04:23] when you watch a when you watch a day
[1:04:26] i'm going to get back to the quote in a
[1:04:27] little bit but i'm going to preach just
[1:04:28] here for a moment
[1:04:30] but when you watch your daddy any any
[1:04:32] and that daddy is trying to get his son
[1:04:35] to perform in maybe an athletic maybe in
[1:04:37] sports or maybe a football or baseball
[1:04:39] that man will go out there and he'll
[1:04:41] tell him now son you go out there and
[1:04:43] show him what you can do
[1:04:46] it's not a time to hold back son if you
[1:04:48] can throw 95 mile an hour it's a time to
[1:04:50] release what you can do it's not a time
[1:04:53] to hold it back it's a time to show it
[1:04:55] out i'll say church of the living god
[1:04:58] it's time that we show hail what we can
[1:05:00] do we're not a weak christian we're not
[1:05:03] a weak church we are the most powerful
[1:05:05] people that's upon the face of the earth

[1:05:10] do you can heal you can save you can
[1:05:14] deliver you can set free let's show them
[1:05:16] what you can do father
[1:05:18] [Applause]
[1:05:29] but what hurts the devil
[1:05:33] what hurts
[1:05:35] the devil
[1:05:36] is to see that sanctified
[1:05:39] holy life
[1:05:40] consecrated to god
[1:05:42] say anything to him call him anything
[1:05:44] just as sweet as it can be move
[1:05:47] and move right on oh that throws him
[1:05:50] away that's the thunder that shakes the
[1:05:52] devil
[1:05:56] that real
[1:05:58] sanctified consecrated holy life you can
[1:06:01] say anything about them but they'll
[1:06:03] still move right on
[1:06:05] that's what hurts the devil
[1:06:08] you can have your best friend say
[1:06:10] something about you but what hurts the
[1:06:12] devil is when you sit there like jesus
[1:06:18] oh it's time that we start living out
[1:06:20] what this message is it's time that we
[1:06:23] sit here under the greatest message and
[1:06:25] not just sit quiet but we live out the
[1:06:28] message sound off the message sometimes
[1:06:32] it's in speaking sometimes it's in
[1:06:34] silence but every day it's a life
[1:06:40] that's the thunder that shakes the devil
[1:06:42] lived voices
[1:06:47] now paul said in first corinthians he
[1:06:49] told us he thought he's talking about
[1:06:51] he's talking about the first man that he
[1:06:53] was earthy he said but the second man
[1:06:55] was of the heavenly is that right
[1:06:58] he said but we have borne the image of
[1:07:01] the earth he said but also we bear the
[1:07:03] image of the heavenly
[1:07:05] and to think that tonight that brother
[1:07:07] branham would preach a sermon on images
[1:07:10] of christ
[1:07:11] and that here she is
[1:07:19] how many had a good old
[1:07:21] tussle this week
[1:07:24] found out you were still human
[1:07:30] not me brother andrew
[1:07:33] but all of heaven is still sitting there
[1:07:38] mad at the world
[1:07:40] got a temper you could fight a bus saw
[1:07:42] with
[1:07:43] but all of heaven's right there
[1:07:46] and when you would go too far
[1:07:49] when you would almost say too much the
[1:07:51] holy spirit said not today
[1:07:54] you're not going back to that kind of
[1:07:56] life you're not going back to that kind
[1:07:58] of language the holy spirit is under is
[1:08:02] fulfilling its purpose and controlling
[1:08:05] your life
[1:08:07] ain't no wonder paul would stand there
[1:08:10] in romans 8 and 1 there is therefore now
[1:08:12] no condemnation to them that are in
[1:08:14] christ jesus who walk not after the
[1:08:17] flesh but after the spirit
[1:08:18] [Music]
[1:08:22] but when paul when paul starts breaking
[1:08:24] into the hebrews and start laying the
[1:08:26] later the letter down to the hebrew
[1:08:28] church
[1:08:29] what do you see he's sitting there and
[1:08:32] he says he said christ didn't come and
[1:08:34] take upon the nature of angels but he
[1:08:36] took upon the seed of abraham because he
[1:08:39] loved you so much he didn't take upon
[1:08:41] the form of an angel he took upon the
[1:08:43] seed of abraham to feel like you to have
[1:08:47] pain like you to understand like
[1:08:50] you what was heaven doing
[1:08:53] heaven and earth had met
[1:08:58] when the lamb
[1:08:59] and the dove met together heathered an
[1:09:02] earth kiss
[1:09:05] what is this
[1:09:06] what is this body
[1:09:08] it's heaven
[1:09:10] on earth
[1:09:15] now you've already witnessed to me that
[1:09:17] you've had tussles and you already found
[1:09:18] out that you were human
[1:09:23] but when you found out you're human
[1:09:25] there was another element
[1:09:27] that showed up
[1:09:32] i know i know that i'm talking to the
[1:09:34] right group here tonight when you got
[1:09:36] flustered
[1:09:37] all of a sudden you said wait a minute
[1:09:38] something's not right and you begin to
[1:09:40] create an atmosphere
[1:09:42] you begin to create an atmosphere what's
[1:09:43] the greatest way to create an atmosphere
[1:09:45] is to worship the living god and all of
[1:09:48] heaven comes down and it starts pushing
[1:09:50] hell right out of your way
[1:09:55] what is it it's exactly it's exactly
[1:09:58] what joel 2 said that in the last days i
[1:10:01] will pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[1:10:04] now brother branham goes in there and
[1:10:05] here's what i think's amazing here's a
[1:10:07] hillbilly kentuckian with a seventh
[1:10:09] grade education can't hardly write his
[1:10:12] own name if you read his notes you can't
[1:10:14] hardly make him out but he goes in there
[1:10:16] and he starts breaking into the greek
[1:10:18] breaking into hebrews and breaking into
[1:10:20] breaking into the bible and he says now
[1:10:22] we can't read it like we read it in the
[1:10:25] english we've got to read it in the
[1:10:26] original greek he said if we say that
[1:10:29] poor he said for us
[1:10:31] he said it means to empty out he said
[1:10:33] but for us it would be like to vomit up
[1:10:35] or give something that was not of
[1:10:37] herself he said but in the last days i
[1:10:40] will pour out my spirit he said what was
[1:10:43] he doing he himself poured himself into
[1:10:47] the church
[1:10:49] he said god can't change in his nature
[1:10:53] he simply changes his form because he's
[1:10:56] still the same yesterday today and
[1:10:58] forever he said now you look he said he
[1:11:01] said when i he said when i became a
[1:11:03] husband he said he said i changed my
[1:11:06] form he said but when i had a baby he
[1:11:08] said i became my daddy he said but when
[1:11:10] i had my grandchildren
[1:11:12] he said then i took on the form of a
[1:11:15] granddaddy he said i was still the same
[1:11:17] person
[1:11:20] he said i was still the same person he
[1:11:22] said i simply changed forms he said but
[1:11:24] you take a 16 year old man he can never
[1:11:27] be under that law or never be under that
[1:11:30] form of a granddaddy he's got to go on
[1:11:32] in years so that he could produce that
[1:11:34] is that right
[1:11:36] he said but what you're looking at he
[1:11:38] said it's the same yesterday today and
[1:11:41] forever that pillar fire that led the
[1:11:43] children of israel is the same pillar of
[1:11:45] fire that's back in the church of the
[1:11:47] living god he's pouring out himself and
[1:11:50] he's simply changing his mask
[1:11:52] what was once in jesus he's now in a
[1:11:55] body
[1:11:58] you are his
[1:12:00] victory
[1:12:02] that's what brother branham said in
[1:12:03] christ the mystery of god revealed he
[1:12:04] said when you see christ coming and
[1:12:05] living down in his church working out in
[1:12:07] his church he said you are his victory
[1:12:11] and to think that you are doing exactly
[1:12:13] what he said in john 14 and 12 that my
[1:12:16] works you'll do these same exact things
[1:12:19] it's not your works it's the works of
[1:12:22] the father
[1:12:30] the other night i
[1:12:31] i woke up to a scene that was
[1:12:34] rather strange to me
[1:12:39] i woke up
[1:12:41] and in my room
[1:12:43] was a bunch of runners
[1:12:48] and i thought it was rather strange
[1:12:50] because these runners that i was seeing
[1:12:52] they were dressed different from the
[1:12:53] other runners
[1:12:55] and i wasn't shown every group but i was
[1:12:57] shown this scene
[1:12:58] of these runners they were dressed
[1:13:00] different and they had a baton in their
[1:13:02] hand and in their hand it had appointed
[1:13:04] the message
[1:13:08] i thought lord
[1:13:10] that's this group
[1:13:13] what he was showing me in the spiritual
[1:13:15] spiritual we're watching in the natural
[1:13:18] you are the final runners
[1:13:20] you are sitting here
[1:13:22] under the final messenger and you are
[1:13:24] running with a message you are the final
[1:13:27] voice you're not just operating outside
[1:13:29] of the message you are the message
[1:13:32] you are that pillar fires in you you are
[1:13:36] the mighty angel christ revealed
[1:13:39] i'll say this you've got a message to
[1:13:41] run with you're dressed a little bit
[1:13:43] different than luther was you're dressed
[1:13:46] different than wesley was but you're
[1:13:48] running
[1:13:52] listen well i don't feel like i am let
[1:13:54] me tell you just put the garment on and
[1:13:56] start stepping in tune to the marching
[1:13:59] music
[1:14:01] run with everything that's within you
[1:14:03] lay aside every weight in sin
[1:14:10] heaven's here
[1:14:12] and when you run out of energy he never
[1:14:14] runs out of energy when you run out i
[1:14:16] hope he never runs out of hope when you
[1:14:18] run out
[1:14:20] when you run out of desire he's never
[1:14:22] run out of desire when you've run out of
[1:14:25] strength he's never run out of strength
[1:14:27] just run
[1:14:31] i ain't got to stand here and i ain't
[1:14:32] got to preach to you every single thing
[1:14:34] and describe it and teach it out what
[1:14:36] the seven seals are you are the seventh
[1:14:39] seal
[1:14:43] now if you go listen to your message
[1:14:45] you'll find i'm teaching you william
[1:14:46] branham's teachings you are
[1:14:49] you are the third full purpose of the
[1:14:52] seventh seal this is christ the mystery
[1:14:55] of god revealed once again in body form
[1:14:59] that's why he's appearing to you is to
[1:15:01] show you who you are this is the bride
[1:15:04] coming of christ
[1:15:12] little by little
[1:15:13] moses said i'll give you the land
[1:15:16] so they don't overtake you
[1:15:18] little by little you're changing
[1:15:20] little by little you're growing
[1:15:22] little by little you're mocking more
[1:15:25] in line
[1:15:29] excuse me
[1:15:34] now what
[1:15:36] mother brandon said what has
[1:15:38] the greatest authority
[1:15:43] an angel from heaven
[1:15:45] or an angel at the pulpit
[1:15:54] doesn't the bible say in hebrews
[1:15:56] that his angels are ministering spirits
[1:16:00] flames of fire
[1:16:02] what has more power
[1:16:04] an angel in heaven or an angel at the
[1:16:06] pulpit
[1:16:07] tell us brother branham he said it's the
[1:16:10] angel at the pulpit he said paul said if
[1:16:13] an angel from heaven comes and preaches
[1:16:15] any other gospel to you then that which
[1:16:17] i've already preached he said let him be
[1:16:19] accursed he said so the angel anointed
[1:16:21] with the holy spirit and with the word
[1:16:23] stands next to god that's right in
[1:16:25] heaven his authority he said all power
[1:16:27] in heaven and earth is given unto my
[1:16:29] hand go and i'll go with you and
[1:16:31] whatever you bind on earth i'll bind in
[1:16:33] heaven and whatever you loose on earth
[1:16:35] i'll loosen heaven he said oh
[1:16:38] if the great holy church only realized
[1:16:40] his power to do these things he said but
[1:16:43] there's so much doubt and fear and
[1:16:44] trembling wondering if it could if it
[1:16:46] could happen he said as long as that
[1:16:49] exists the church can never stand
[1:16:51] upright he said and when every talk of
[1:16:53] fear is vanished and the holy spirit is
[1:16:56] completely in control of the church then
[1:16:58] all fears are gone and that church has
[1:17:00] the power
[1:17:03] who is that church
[1:17:09] now you know i ain't gonna preach
[1:17:11] without you
[1:17:12] who is that church
[1:17:15] you know ain't just talking about the
[1:17:16] preachers you know i ain't just talking
[1:17:18] about the ministers you know ain't just
[1:17:20] talking about the deacons you know ain't
[1:17:22] just talking about the ushers surely i'm
[1:17:25] talking about somebody else in this
[1:17:26] building it ain't just the musicians it
[1:17:29] ain't just of the tambourine players it
[1:17:31] ain't just the hand clappers it's a
[1:17:33] little children this is a church of the
[1:17:36] living god
[1:17:38] [Applause]
[1:17:41] he said but when every talk of fear is
[1:17:43] vanished and the holy spirit is
[1:17:45] completely in control of the church then
[1:17:48] all fears are gone and oh
[1:17:51] and that a church has the power why they
[1:17:53] have everything the heaven owns behind
[1:17:55] them they're ambassadors of the throne
[1:17:58] an ambassador of christ has the
[1:18:00] authority and everything that christ
[1:18:03] owns belongs to that ambassador
[1:18:07] and he said go ye in all the world
[1:18:10] you are my witnesses after the holy
[1:18:11] ghost has come upon you and what is a
[1:18:13] witness it's an ambassador it's to come
[1:18:16] and witness something he said the whole
[1:18:18] powers of heaven
[1:18:20] is right
[1:18:22] in
[1:18:23] your
[1:18:24] hands
[1:18:29] i've already read to you the scripture
[1:18:30] in matthew 18
[1:18:32] that any two or three gathered in my
[1:18:34] name there i'll be in the midst of them
[1:18:37] and if two of you agree touching one
[1:18:39] thing let it be done
[1:18:42] i believe
[1:18:43] there is power in these words
[1:18:47] i happen to believe that if you stood
[1:18:48] there right now
[1:18:50] that heaven is so close to you that you
[1:18:53] could bind your hearts together in
[1:18:55] christian love and you could watch the
[1:18:57] miraculous take place
[1:18:59] that's why he's here the omnipotence is
[1:19:02] behind this message the all-powerful is
[1:19:05] behind this message the miraculous is
[1:19:08] here
[1:19:08] it's time that you start taking your
[1:19:11] word
[1:19:15] not just god's word but your word and
[1:19:18] start accessing all of heaven
[1:19:21] that means got a real need
[1:19:25] a real need
[1:19:29] you don't have to wait for next
[1:19:30] weekend's labor day meeting
[1:19:33] heaven's right here
[1:19:35] the anointing's right here
[1:19:37] there's many of you that got spiritual
[1:19:39] needs and heaven is right here
[1:19:43] i watched young girls last weekend get
[1:19:46] filled with the baptism of the holy
[1:19:48] ghost so why can't he do it right here
[1:19:52] i watched prodigals return
[1:19:55] last weekend so why that can't they
[1:19:57] happen right here
[1:19:59] i watched plantar fasciitis completely
[1:20:02] dissolved so why can't it happen right
[1:20:04] here
[1:20:05] we watch sugar diabetes completely
[1:20:07] healed why can't it happen right here
[1:20:12] come on somebody we watched pinched
[1:20:14] nerves completely common hinged
[1:20:17] why can't it happen right here
[1:20:27] a huge portion
[1:20:29] of heaven
[1:20:33] but oh
[1:20:35] maybe you don't have enough faith for a
[1:20:37] huge part
[1:20:38] but maybe just to crumb
[1:20:42] maybe you're a crumb seeker for a little
[1:20:43] bit of heaven tonight
[1:20:45] i believe that if you'll have the right
[1:20:47] heart
[1:20:48] god will come by your way
[1:20:56] i know i don't watch too much of the
[1:20:57] supernatural to stand back and say god
[1:21:00] don't do it no more
[1:21:01] i've done i've been stood back and i've
[1:21:03] watched as we lay hands on the sick
[1:21:05] they've completely restored i've watched
[1:21:07] as we lay hands that demons are cast out
[1:21:10] i've come too far to tell for that the
[1:21:12] enemy to come and start squeezing down
[1:21:15] on the church of the living god and say
[1:21:17] those things don't happen no more heaven
[1:21:20] is here and brother branham said in the
[1:21:22] junction of time he said when all hell
[1:21:24] is turned loose oh heaven turns loose
[1:21:27] it's time we're seeing the lid of hell
[1:21:29] kicked off let's see heaven opened up
[1:21:35] hell's on a rampage just look at the
[1:21:37] news you see a new elvis rising on the
[1:21:40] scene you see all kinds of turmoil
[1:21:42] rising on the scene it's prophesied that
[1:21:44] it would be here but you've been
[1:21:46] prophesied that you'd be here
[1:21:51] look at revelations 9 look at matthew 24
[1:21:54] that false christ and false prophets
[1:21:55] would rise up
[1:21:58] we're here
[1:22:05] he got that picture
[1:22:07] that first picture
[1:22:08] i ain't got my glasses on i can't tell
[1:22:11] if that's just jewelry up there it is
[1:22:13] praise the lord
[1:22:14] says joy if you can throw that first
[1:22:16] picture on for us
[1:22:19] now you know that brother branham
[1:22:21] told us in christ a mystery god revealed
[1:22:24] he said it was once though anointed man
[1:22:26] he said but now it's the anointed people
[1:22:29] anointed by what
[1:22:32] by accepting what eve turned down
[1:22:36] but if we've been anointed by accepting
[1:22:38] what eve turned down
[1:22:40] you watch brother random comes and he
[1:22:41] preaches on the anointed ones at the end
[1:22:43] time there's an anointed group that's
[1:22:45] anointed by rejecting what he's turned
[1:22:46] down
[1:22:48] and you watch you watch what you have
[1:22:51] you see the very benefits why you ex of
[1:22:54] accepting the message what it's produced
[1:22:56] your bone of his bone your life of his
[1:22:58] life power of his power but you watch
[1:23:00] what's watch those men and you watch
[1:23:02] those spirits that spirit of rejection
[1:23:05] to turn against the message and turn
[1:23:07] against the power and turn against the
[1:23:09] preaching of the word you watch the life
[1:23:11] that comes behind the rejection it's not
[1:23:14] that of christ it's that of the false
[1:23:16] anointed ones
[1:23:20] but you remember in 1950 they challenged
[1:23:22] our prophet
[1:23:24] they challenged our prophet
[1:23:27] they challenged him and said that he was
[1:23:28] a divine healer and was saying all these
[1:23:31] things and brother branham said you
[1:23:32] remember brother man i'm saying i'm not
[1:23:33] no more a divine healer than more than
[1:23:35] i'm a divine savior
[1:23:39] and you remember brother bosworth he
[1:23:40] said no he said let me he said i won't
[1:23:42] go down there and argue with him he says
[1:23:43] but i'll just take the scriptures but
[1:23:45] you notice what the media put on here
[1:23:47] they put f bosworth he upholds miracles
[1:23:50] reverend william branham a faith healer
[1:23:52] but notice reverend w e best it is the
[1:23:56] baptist plural champion so here is their
[1:23:59] champion standing against these davids
[1:24:04] and they were refuting and refusing to
[1:24:07] accept that the god of miracles was
[1:24:09] still living
[1:24:11] and they challenged they challenged him
[1:24:13] dr bosworth brother bosworth stood right
[1:24:15] there and he told him he said you answer
[1:24:18] me this question it's jehovah of the old
[1:24:20] testament jesus christ of the new and he
[1:24:23] couldn't answer him a word he said but i
[1:24:25] believe william branham's in the
[1:24:26] building he said maybe he'll come he
[1:24:28] said i don't know and brother brandon
[1:24:30] was up there to disguise sitting in that
[1:24:31] balcony with his wife and his brother
[1:24:33] and those policemen and those guards
[1:24:35] watching over him and he and his brother
[1:24:37] doctor said don't go down there but the
[1:24:39] spirit of the lord said you go down
[1:24:41] there bill you go down there and the
[1:24:44] angels god the angels guarded that aisle
[1:24:47] as william branham stepped down through
[1:24:49] there and he walked through sam houston
[1:24:51] coliseum
[1:24:58] good evening friends
[1:25:01] and you know how brother branham handled
[1:25:03] things
[1:25:04] and he stood right there
[1:25:05] and he started saying a few words and
[1:25:07] all of a sudden he said i felt a
[1:25:09] churning over top of my head and the
[1:25:11] wind blowing around go
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:16] he said now
[1:25:19] he's here
[1:25:23] we're annoying it by accepting
[1:25:24] what this pillar of fire led us to
[1:25:27] that's what jesus told us what the what
[1:25:30] what the holy spirit was it would be a
[1:25:31] holy spirit to be the truth and it would
[1:25:33] be our comforter and it would be our god
[1:25:35] the holy spirit has guided us to this
[1:25:37] message it was not some evil spirit that
[1:25:40] led you to this message it was the
[1:25:42] spirit of the living god and you didn't
[1:25:44] get here because your mom and daddy
[1:25:45] birthed you into this and just because
[1:25:47] you you grew up knowing this the spirit
[1:25:49] of the living god led you to this
[1:25:52] and he wanted to make sure that you knew
[1:25:54] that you knew that you knew that it was
[1:25:56] real so the pillar of fire came and it
[1:26:00] changed the situation in your life
[1:26:03] go ahead sister zorya
[1:26:05] and our critics dr beth said you have a
[1:26:09] photographer he hired a photographer to
[1:26:11] stand there he said you take a picture
[1:26:13] of me pointing my finger in dr
[1:26:15] bosworth's face or william branham's
[1:26:17] face and that photographer took ten
[1:26:20] pictures and none of them produced
[1:26:23] except for this one
[1:26:27] it was not us that took that picture it
[1:26:29] was our critics that are anointed to
[1:26:32] reject it
[1:26:34] and for once since 2000 years the pillar
[1:26:38] of fire is back
[1:26:41] you are led by that pillar of fire

[1:28:51] here to lead you through the word
[1:28:54] i had no knowledge and i
[1:28:56] forgive me for being a little bit
[1:28:57] elementary right here i had no knowledge
[1:28:59] of this bible
[1:29:01] i've read it all my days and you watch a
[1:29:03] young person their favorite book is
[1:29:04] psalms because that's all they can
[1:29:06] really understand

[1:29:09] it read about four or five psalms every
[1:29:11] single day
[1:29:13] i had really no knowledge of it
[1:29:14] [Music]
[1:29:17] but in 15 years
[1:29:19] i still don't hardly know anything about
[1:29:20] him
[1:29:21] but he's the one that led me through the
[1:29:23] scriptures
[1:29:25] my daddy didn't give me this
[1:29:27] i had a great mentor and i had a great
[1:29:29] coach and brother homer brother charlie
[1:29:31] brother ron
[1:29:33] but they couldn't give us this
[1:29:36] you look at brother william look at

[1:29:56] that you get what you need
[1:30:00] i'm gonna i'm gonna end on this this
[1:30:02] thought right here
[1:30:04] when elijah was up there
[1:30:06] [Music]
[1:30:08] and all of heaven had been shut up he
[1:30:10] shut up the heavens for three and a half
[1:30:11] years
[1:30:12] no rain
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:15] and everybody else was in famine but
[1:30:18] elijah was up there and feast
[1:30:21] brother branham said he had some porters
[1:30:23] that were coming up there and dropping
[1:30:24] off dropping off sandwiches up there
[1:30:27] and he was feeding
[1:30:29] right there at the brook of tereth all
[1:30:31] those days
[1:30:34] heaven
[1:30:35] was taken care of the prophet
[1:30:39] and the man challenged brother brown
[1:30:41] said now you really don't believe
[1:30:43] you really don't believe that those
[1:30:45] those crows or those porters fed him
[1:30:47] sandwiches
[1:30:48] so where could they have got them at he
[1:30:50] said i don't know where they got him at
[1:30:52] he said all i know is is that they were
[1:30:54] feeding him
[1:30:55] and he said there's a lot of people that
[1:30:57] sit around and say well why are they
[1:30:59] shouting like they do why are they
[1:31:00] acting like they do he said i can't
[1:31:03] explain it he said but it's the rain
[1:31:04] it's the manna that's falling upon them
[1:31:07] that's making them shout and maybe you
[1:31:08] don't understand why you're feasting
[1:31:10] where you're feasting at but heaven has
[1:31:13] dropped down this food in this season
[1:31:15] for you to feed on
