[18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to be in here in the house
[18:42] of the Lord. Let's go to the prayer
[18:44] request this evening. Want to remember
[18:46] each and every one of our elderly that
[18:48] has requested prayer. want to ask that
[18:51] uh we're a member of prayer for the ones
[18:53] that's dealing with cancer, fighting
[18:55] that battle. Our pastor, brother Ron,
[18:58] Sister Teresa Delaney, Sister Wanda
[19:00] Hinkle, Brother Jeff Breeden. So, just
[19:03] be remembering each and every one of
[19:04] them. Please remember Shirley Williams
[19:08] in your prayers. She had surgery this
[19:10] past week and there were se some
[19:13] complications and she is in a lot of
[19:16] pain. Thank you, Sister Jamie Turner.
[19:18] How many would have an unspoken request
[19:20] say, "Lord, just pass by my way this
[19:22] evening." I'm ask brother William if he
[19:24] would just come lead us to the throne of
[19:26] grace this evening.
[19:32] Amen. Let's bow our heads and our hearts
[19:33] to our Lord and Savior. Dear gracious,
[19:36] kind heavenly father, Lord, it's just
[19:38] with humble hearts, Lord, that we come
[19:39] before you in prayer. Lord, we thank you
[19:42] for being so good to us, Lord. And we
[19:44] thank you for your love, your grace, and
[19:45] your mercy. Lord, we thank you, Father,
[19:48] that you have all things under control,
[19:50] Lord. And many times, Lord, as we go
[19:52] through life, Father, Lord, you're a
[19:53] friend, as your word says, that
[19:55] stickketh closer than a brother. Lord,
[19:57] we thank you, Lord, that before we even
[19:59] have a thought in our mind, Lord, before
[20:00] we even speak a word, Lord, you know
[20:02] what that's going to be because
[20:03] nothing's ever taken you by surprise.
[20:06] And Lord, you heard each and every
[20:07] request, Lord, that was read. Father
[20:10] God, there's many storms in lives, Lord.
[20:12] And we all have needs, Lord. And because
[20:14] that's what you made us to be as a needy
[20:16] people. But Father, we want to turn our
[20:18] attention, Lord Jesus, to to you, the
[20:21] answer to every single one of them
[20:22] needs. Lord, as brother Matthew said,
[20:25] Lord, it may not come in how we want it
[20:27] or the timing of it, but Father, we just
[20:29] ask that you give us patience and grace
[20:31] to wait. Lord, Job didn't understand why
[20:34] he was going through what he was going
[20:36] through. But he was able, oh God, with a
[20:38] revelation from you to stand and say
[20:40] that he knows that his redeemer liveth.
[20:44] Father God, we can stand with the same
[20:46] testimony and say that I know that my
[20:49] redeemer liveth. I know that my redeemer
[20:52] took stripes on his back for me. I know
[20:55] that he died, Father God. I know that he
[20:59] was nailed to a tree for my
[21:01] justification.
[21:02] I know that he went to hell for my sins.
[21:05] But oh God, we know that you raised from
[21:08] the dead. Mighty conqueror, Father God,
[21:10] and nothing could stand before your
[21:12] presence.
[21:13] How we hear, Father, so many situations
[21:16] come before the prophet in the prayer
[21:17] lines. And not one situation was able to
[21:20] stand before faith in the same living
[21:23] God. Father God, there's nothing new
[21:25] under the sun. There's no new fight,
[21:28] Lord, that we're fighting that hasn't
[21:29] already been fought before by other
[21:31] believers. But, oh God, we serve the
[21:33] same God that delivered, Father God, all
[21:36] of your children. And you are the same
[21:38] yesterday, today, and forever. So, we
[21:40] take the same faith of Jesus Christ. Not
[21:44] just faith in Jesus Christ, but we take
[21:47] the faith of Jesus Christ. We apply it
[21:51] to every request and every need that we
[21:53] have in our lives. We give it to you and
[21:56] knowing that you're going to do exactly
[21:58] what you promised to do. For there's one
[22:00] thing you cannot do and that's fail. You
[22:03] cannot lie and fail. Father, we believe
[22:05] you with all of our hearts. We ask your
[22:07] blessings over this service. Bless
[22:08] brother Andrew. We thank you for giving
[22:10] them traveling mercies. We just pray
[22:12] that you restore their strength. Bless
[22:14] them now, Lord, as he delivers the word,
[22:16] Lord. May you just open up our hearts.
[22:17] May we receive, Lord, and pull on your
[22:19] gift this evening. Bless the tithe and
[22:21] offering, Lord. bless all those that
[22:23] will hear this service by way of the
[22:25] internet. May you please visit all the
[22:27] sick and needy. In Jesus Christ's name
[22:29] we pray and ask all these things. Amen.
[22:35] Amen. At this time, we're going to
[22:36] receive this evening's offering. You
[22:37] give us God's bless. We're going to have
[22:39] brother Chester come sing for us this
[22:41] evening. We'll have brother Jordan come
[22:43] sing for us. Let's sing One of them. I'm
[22:45] one of them. Aren't you glad that you
[22:47] can say you're one of them this evening?

[23:25] strings that made them clean. It is
[23:28] burning now in my heart. Glory to his
[23:33] name. I'm so glad I can say I want to
[23:38] be.

[23:51] want to be.

[24:05] of the
[24:07] Oh, they were together in the
[24:12] praise in his name. Oh, they were
[24:15] baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[24:19] powerful service came. Now, what he did
[24:23] for that day, he will do for you the
[24:27] same. Well, I'm so glad.

[24:34] of that? Well, I'm one of thee.

[35:30] through it all, my heart will choose to
[35:34] sing your praise.
[35:39] I know that you are good.
[35:44] I know that you are kind.
[35:47] [Music]
[35:49] I know that you are so much more
[35:54] than what I leave behind.
[35:59] I know that I am loved.
[36:04] I know that I am safe.
[36:09] Cuz even in the fire to live is Christ.
[36:14] To die is gain.
[36:19] I know that you are good.
[36:23] Yeah.
[36:29] I know that you are good.
[36:33] Yeah.
[36:37] [Music]

[36:56] Amen. We serve a good God, don't we?
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand.
[37:04] Let's sing a song. Said I wasn't going
[37:05] to tell nobody, but I couldn't keep it
[37:07] to myself. When the Lord gets a hold of
[37:10] your life, whether you say something or
[37:11] not, it's going to show. Amen. Listen.
[37:16] Said I wasn't going to tell nobody. But
[37:18] I couldn't keep it to myself. I couldn't
[37:22] keep it to myself. I couldn't keep it to
[37:26] myself. said I wouldn't go tell nobody
[37:30] but I couldn't keep it to myself what
[37:34] the Lord has done for me.
[37:39] Well, you ought to have been there
[37:42] when he saved my soul.
[37:46] Will you ought been there
[37:49] when he put my name on the road?
[37:53] I started walking. I started talking. I
[37:57] started singing. I started shouting
[38:01] about what the Lord has done for me.
[38:06] Oh, said I was going to testify, but I I
[38:11] couldn't keep it to myself.
[38:14] I couldn't keep it to myself.
[38:17] I couldn't keep it to myself. said I
[38:21] would go testify, but I I couldn't keep
[38:25] it to myself. But the Lord has done for
[38:30] me.
[38:32] Well, you are the

[38:47] I started walking. I started talking. I
[38:51] started singing. I started shouting
[38:54] about what the Lord has done for me.
[38:58] [Music]
[39:00] Oh, said I wasn't going to shout. Sure.
[39:03] But I I couldn't keep it.
[39:07] Oh, I couldn't keep it to myself.
[39:11] I couldn't keep it to myself. said I
[39:15] would go shout the joy that I I couldn't
[39:18] keep it to myself.
[39:23] Oh, you ought to be there.
[39:26] Well, you ought to prepare
[39:30] when you save my soul.
[39:33] Well, you ought to be there.
[39:37] I saw my name over.
[39:42] I started walking. I started talking. I
[39:45] started singing. I started shouting
[39:49] about what the Lord
[39:52] Oh, you ought to be there. Well, you
[39:55] ought to been there.
[39:58] You save my soul.
[40:01] Will you ought to be there?
[40:05] When I saw my name on the road,
[40:09] I started walking. I started talking. I
[40:13] started sing. I started shouting about
[40:18] one.
[40:19] One last thing I said I wasn't.
[40:23] I said I was going to tell no old nobody
[40:27] but I couldn't keep it. Oh, when the
[40:30] Lord gets a hold of you, you can't. I
[40:35] couldn't keep it to myself. Said I
[40:38] wasn't going to tell nobody but I
[40:42] couldn't keep it to myself what the Lord
[40:46] has done for me. Well, you ought to have
[40:50] been Well, you ought to have been there,
[40:52] brother Andrew.
[40:55] [Music]
[41:01] When I saw my name on the road,
[41:06] I started walking. I started talking, I
[41:10] started singing, and I started shouting
[41:14] about what the Lord had done for me.
[41:21] Has the Lord done something for you?
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[41:25] the Lord, isn't it, this evening? Amen.
[41:27] If you have your Bibles tonight, we'd
[41:29] like to look over in the book of 2
[41:31] Corinthians, chapter 4, Numbers chapter
[41:34] 13. It's good to be back home uh with
[41:37] the believers. We we had just an
[41:40] absolute wonderful time with the
[41:42] believers there at Cloverdale and
[41:46] and uh you know it's kind of like it's
[41:48] kind of like eating steak or at a
[41:50] Mexican restaurant and you'd say that
[41:52] was the best steak you ever had in your
[41:53] life or because it was the last steak
[41:55] you ever had and uh I would say that's
[41:58] one of the best meetings that we've ever
[42:00] had and u not because it was the last
[42:03] ones it was just it was just so intimate
[42:05] and such in a very special way that you
[42:07] begin to see the Lord move and just so
[42:10] grateful and it was a real honor to
[42:12] preach alongside my my brother and my
[42:14] dad and and the Lord used them in a
[42:17] specific way and just we we have great
[42:20] friends there and the church there loves
[42:22] Full Gospel Lighthouse and they they
[42:24] they know you by name. They may not they
[42:27] may not know everything about you but
[42:29] they know where you sit at and they know
[42:30] when you miss church and they know
[42:33] they it's amazing. It's amazing. You
[42:36] know, you go across the world and people
[42:37] just people just know you because of
[42:39] because you worship you worship the same
[42:42] God. You live the same message and you
[42:45] love the same Lord Jesus Christ as they
[42:47] do. And and we have such a wonderful
[42:49] family all over the world. And my it's
[42:52] it's an honor. It's an honor to be a
[42:54] part of the bride of Jesus Christ, isn't
[42:56] it? Amen. I think we have some of uh
[42:59] Sister Dorothy's family, Sister Dorothy
[43:01] Mccclard's family here with us. God God
[43:02] bless you. We thank you for being here
[43:04] tonight. Amen. God richly bless you.
[43:06] Amen. If you have your Bibles, we just,
[43:08] as we said, we'd like to look at 2
[43:10] Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 18.
[43:14] I'd like to just take a thought uh this
[43:16] evening on on there. We saw giants. And
[43:21] I I ministered just a little bit on this
[43:23] thought uh while I was there in Canada.
[43:25] And if you if you did catch that, don't
[43:27] cancel me out because you heard you
[43:29] heard some of those sayings. You'll just
[43:30] know where to amen at. Uh, but this is
[43:34] completely in my mind it's completely
[43:36] different for Full Gospel Lighthouse.
[43:37] But I want to minister something to you
[43:39] in the next coming weeks and and I need
[43:41] I need to lay this groundwork in there
[43:43] to be able to minister uh on those
[43:45] things. Amen. How many has a need you
[43:48] like just make known unto the Lord?
[43:50] Amen. God richly bless you. I pray God
[43:53] blesses you tonight in a special way and
[43:55] teaches teaches you and touches you and
[43:58] ministers to you in a very specific way.
[44:01] Let's just go and talk to the author of
[44:03] the book before we read it this evening.
[44:05] Heavenly Father, we come before you,
[44:07] Father, in a very special way. Lord, we
[44:10] we just want to humble ourselves before
[44:12] you, Father, here in this intimate room,
[44:14] Lord, where you have dealt with us,
[44:16] Lord. It's kind of like coming into a
[44:18] bed chamber of two lovers, Lord Jesus.
[44:21] We we realize, Lord, that your sacred
[44:23] presence has gone before us. You've
[44:25] prepared all the things, Lord Jesus, for
[44:28] us so that we could come into this place
[44:30] of destiny, Lord, to worship you, Lord,
[44:33] to honor you and give praise unto you,
[44:35] Father. We pray, God, that tonight that
[44:38] you would just move amongst us in a
[44:40] special way, that you would just drive
[44:42] back fear and and all of the things that
[44:44] would hinder us from moving into the
[44:46] promises of God. We count it an honor,
[44:49] Lord, to to read your word, Father. And
[44:51] we realize that when we read your word,
[44:53] we are looking at a vision in word form.
[44:56] And we pray that you would make yourself
[44:57] known amongst us tonight in a specific
[45:00] way. We love you so much and ask God
[45:02] that you move upon the hearts of these
[45:04] believers tonight that have lifted up
[45:06] their hands. They have needs Lord only
[45:09] you can meet. And we ask, Father, that
[45:11] you would make yourself known amongst us
[45:13] in a specific way. And may you receive
[45:15] all the glory and honor and praise in
[45:17] Jesus name. Amen. And amen. 2
[45:21] Corinthians chapter 4 verse 18 says that
[45:24] while we look not at the things which
[45:27] are seen but at the things which are not
[45:30] seen for the things which are seen are
[45:33] temporal but the things which are not
[45:36] seen are eternal. Numbers chapter 13 and
[45:40] verse 25.
[45:50] And they returned from searching of the
[45:53] land after 40 days. And they went and
[45:56] came to Moses and to Aaron and to all
[45:59] the congregation of the children in
[46:01] Israel under the wilderness of Piran to
[46:04] Cadesh and brought back word unto them
[46:07] and unto the all the congregation and
[46:09] showed them the fruit of the land. And
[46:12] they told him and said, We came into the
[46:15] land whether thou sinnest, and surely it
[46:18] flowth with milk and honey, and this is
[46:20] the fruit of it. Nevertheless, the
[46:23] people be strong that dwell in the land,
[46:26] and the cities are walled and very
[46:28] great. And moreover, we saw the children
[46:30] of Anch there. The Amlikites dwell in
[46:33] the land of the south, and the Hittites,
[46:35] and the Jebusites, and the Amorites
[46:38] dwell in the mountains, and the
[46:39] Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the
[46:42] coast of Jordan. And Caleb stealed the
[46:45] people before Moses and said us said,
[46:48] "Let us go up at once and possess it,
[46:51] for we are well able to overcome it."
[46:54] But the men that went up with him said,
[46:57] "We be not able to go up against the
[46:59] people, for they are stronger than we."
[47:03] And when I was a young person, I I began
[47:05] to read that scripture and it meant so
[47:07] much to me to realize that you might be
[47:10] surrounded by people. And you might have
[47:12] you might have close friends that go go
[47:14] to church with you, but to realize that
[47:17] God has called you to be set aside for a
[47:20] purpose. And whether whether the crowd's
[47:22] with you or not, whether the whether the
[47:24] opposition is great, God has got a
[47:27] destiny. He's got a place. And it meant
[47:29] so much to me as a young person to read
[47:31] those things that there was there was
[47:33] one amongst the crowd. There was one
[47:36] amongst the crowd that said, "We be not
[47:38] they they they but the men that went up
[47:40] said, "We be not able to stand up or to
[47:43] be against the people for they're
[47:45] stronger than we." And they brought up
[47:47] an evil report of the land. Notice they
[47:50] brought it up. It was the crowd. It was
[47:51] the ones that that Caleb and Joshua was
[47:54] with, the friends, the the the the loved
[47:56] ones, the people they had fellowship and
[47:58] they'd worshiped with. They brought up
[48:00] an evil report which they had searched
[48:03] the under the children of Israel, and
[48:05] saying, "The land through which we have
[48:07] gone to search it is a land that eateth
[48:09] up the inhabitants thereof, and all the
[48:12] people that that we saw in it are men of
[48:15] great stature." And there we saw the
[48:18] giants, the son of Anch, which came
[48:21] which come of the giants, and we were in
[48:25] our own sight as grassho grasshoppers.
[48:28] And so we were in their sight. May God
[48:32] bless his word. You may be seated
[48:34] tonight in the presence of the Lord. And
[48:36] I'd like to just draw our context for
[48:38] this evening from that last verse, verse
[48:40] 33. And there we saw the giants, the son
[48:44] of Anch, which came of the giants, and
[48:47] we were in our sight as grasshoppers.
[48:51] And so we were in their sight. And I I
[48:53] believe that is the that is the epitome
[48:56] of fear in in in its in its entirety
[48:59] right there. That fear has the ability
[49:01] to be able to change how that you look
[49:04] at God's promises. It has the ability to
[49:07] change how that you look and how that
[49:09] other things look. And we realize it
[49:11] doesn't matter what church that you grow
[49:14] up in. It doesn't matter the community
[49:15] that you grow up in. It doesn't matter
[49:17] if you're under the message of the hour
[49:19] or even if you grow up in a church where
[49:21] where Moses is the is the pastor. It
[49:24] will show you right here in these
[49:26] scriptures that Satan will wage war on
[49:29] your mind. No matter no matter where you
[49:31] came from and no matter who what family
[49:33] you are that Satan will war wage war in
[49:37] your mind so fiercefully that the
[49:40] troubles and the obstacles and the
[49:42] giants that you face can actually twist
[49:44] your faith into unbelief and can
[49:47] actually steal your inheritance. Because
[49:50] when you begin to give more power to
[49:52] what is against you than to the one that
[49:54] is for you, you have already surrendered
[49:57] the victory before you ever entered into
[49:59] the battle. When you start giving into
[50:01] fear and you start giving into the
[50:03] mindset of the enemy, you begin to open
[50:06] up yourself unto evil spirits that will
[50:09] make you think that the things that you
[50:11] are facing is greater than the god that
[50:14] is on the inside of you.
[50:16] Brother man said in in in Speak to the
[50:19] Rock, he said the devil hasn't got one
[50:21] legal right at all. Nowhere. He's just a
[50:24] devil and a password. That's all. He
[50:26] hasn't got no legal right to any man
[50:28] that'll accept the promises of Jesus
[50:30] Christ. He's whipped. Yes, sir. He is
[50:33] whipped in sickness. He is whipped in
[50:35] disappointments. He is whipped in
[50:37] everything. He is whipped in death. He
[50:39] can't scare me. He can't scare you.
[50:42] That's all that he is. Is a big old
[50:44] shadow. And I would like to say this to
[50:46] you as we move forward into this that if
[50:49] you have battles in front of you and if
[50:52] you have things that are there or giants
[50:54] that are in front of you, I want you to
[50:56] know that you can dismiss the devil by
[50:59] simply accepting what God said in his
[51:01] word by taking faith and putting it into
[51:04] action. And the Bible said that faith
[51:06] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[51:09] word of God. And the reason why these
[51:11] brothers, these 10 brothers had lost the
[51:14] faith is that they had got themselves
[51:16] away from listening to the word or
[51:18] listening to the message of the hour and
[51:20] they had not taken the message and put
[51:23] it into action. But when you take this
[51:25] message and you put it into action, you
[51:28] might see obstacles, you might see
[51:30] giants, you might see walls in front of
[51:32] you, but the God that is on the inside
[51:34] of you is greater than the giant that is
[51:36] in front of you.
[51:39] Now, brother man said in God
[51:40] commissioning Moses. Now, Joseph,
[51:42] Joshua, and Caleb when they went over,
[51:45] he said, "I like that thought there." He
[51:47] said, "When they come over the 10 that
[51:49] came back and said, "Oh, we look like
[51:50] grasshoppers up the side of them." And
[51:52] Joshua and Caleb said, "We can do it."
[51:54] That's right. Why? Because God promised
[51:57] that we could do it. God said that we
[51:59] could do it. God promised our fathers
[52:01] that we that that we was going to that
[52:03] was our land and that belongs to us. No
[52:05] matter if they got themselves walled
[52:07] cities and they look like giants and
[52:09] everything else, he quit looking at
[52:11] giants and started looking at God's
[52:13] word. And that's what we've got to do in
[52:16] this hour. We've got to stop looking at
[52:17] the giants of Leosa. We've got to stop
[52:20] looking at the things that are in front
[52:21] of us and take God's word because this
[52:24] word has never failed. This word can
[52:28] never be conquered. This word will never
[52:30] be defeated.
[52:32] I believe it's a message that we can
[52:34] anchor our soul in this evening. And
[52:37] when and women when men and women quit
[52:40] looking at their sicknesses and their
[52:42] diseases and start looking to what God
[52:44] said about it, you'll take over. Do you
[52:47] realize that if there is a giant in your
[52:49] way, it's because there's a blessing
[52:51] there where the giant is standing at. If
[52:54] you could stop looking at the disease
[52:56] and start looking at God's promise, the
[52:59] reason why the giant is on that specific
[53:02] ground is because that is where your
[53:04] victory is at
[53:07] &gt;&gt; and start looking to what God said about
[53:09] it, you'll take over. All things are
[53:11] subject to Jesus Christ. All things are
[53:14] subject to you in prayer. When you ask
[53:16] in his name and believe it, ask what you
[53:19] will in my name and it shall be done.
[53:21] That's right. Whatsoever things you
[53:23] desire when you pray,
[53:26] believe it, you shall receive it, and
[53:29] you shall have it.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Now, that's the power of prayer is that
[53:33] it moves the giant out of the way, and
[53:35] you get everything you have need of by
[53:38] prayer. Prayer simply changes what is in
[53:42] front of you and puts it behind you and
[53:45] places God's promises. Hallelujah.
[53:50] Stop looking at the things that you're
[53:53] looking at here and look at the unseen.
[53:55] God said we could do it.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; I love what brother Mhamm said about
[54:02] Joshua is that Joshua seen the same
[54:05] thing that Caleb seen. The reason why he
[54:08] could see the same thing that Caleb was
[54:11] seeing was because they was born that
[54:13] way. They were born from above. You see,
[54:17] now notice these 10 spies that was
[54:19] walking with Joshua and Caleb, they was
[54:21] made out of the same pot ash, the same
[54:24] calcium, and and all the elements that
[54:26] had made up their bodies. But the major
[54:29] difference between them and Caleb and
[54:32] Joshua is that Caleb and Joshua had a
[54:35] destiny to go under victory. They had
[54:37] been lifted up to look into a heavenly
[54:40] high eyesight to be able to see what
[54:43] God's promises was instead of looking at
[54:46] at the giants that was in front of them.
[54:48] I want to say this before I really get
[54:50] into my context is that faith does not
[54:54] deny giants. But faith defies giants.
[55:00] Faith will defy it. It doesn't say that
[55:02] the walls ain't fair. It doesn't say
[55:04] that giants aren't real. It doesn't say
[55:06] the cancer ain't real. It doesn't say
[55:08] the anxiety and the problems of Leoya
[55:11] ain't real. But your faith
[55:14] defies it and said, "I defy you and
[55:17] every foe and every every ability that
[55:20] that giant has."
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Faith cripples your giants.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; I feel like preaching tonight. There was
[55:29] a difference between the two was because
[55:32] they was operating by headship.
[55:35] that was leading them. Hallelujah. It
[55:38] was leading them to a destiny.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; I love what the scripture says in Exodus
[55:45] 23 and 20 that behold I will send my
[55:48] angel before thee to bring thee into the
[55:50] place which I have prepared. I want to
[55:53] say this to you that there is a place
[55:56] that is prepared for the believer.
[56:00] It doesn't matter what state that you're
[56:02] in. It doesn't matter the level that you
[56:04] are as a Christian, there is a prepared
[56:08] destiny that is in front of you. You
[56:10] see, when you look at the when you look
[56:13] at the believers and they're walking
[56:15] down the road of Emmas and they're going
[56:17] down there and they're doubting and
[56:19] they're fearing. But what Satan does not
[56:21] realize is that those brothers that was
[56:25] walking with Jesus had a designation
[56:28] that before Jesus was ever hung on a
[56:31] cross, they had a designation to see him
[56:34] in the resurrection.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could just change our
[56:41] vision just for a minute to look at the
[56:44] future.
[56:47] things would be completely different
[56:49] tonight if you would begin to look at
[56:51] things in the future instead of the
[56:54] present.
[56:56] If if we could just change the disciples
[56:59] view for a minute that the things that
[57:01] you are seeing are simply temporal,
[57:06] but the things that you are not seeing
[57:08] are eternal.
[57:10] But what you see right now is Jesus
[57:13] being crucified and Jesus being whipped.
[57:16] But if we can look at the future, we see
[57:18] the Holy Spirit being birthed into 120
[57:22] vessels.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; What would happen if you acted
[57:30] from your future
[57:32] instead of your past or your present?
[57:36] What would transpire in your own home
[57:38] life if you started acting like you are
[57:42] already in heaven? If you are already
[57:44] operating by victory, if you are already
[57:47] overcoming. If you started operating
[57:50] from your future destiny. Hallelujah.
[57:53] Instead of your current status.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; How many ever been to a spot where you
[58:00] didn't have two nickels to rub together?
[58:05] I've been there. I've been $300 from
[58:08] losing everything within my name. A few
[58:11] times in my life, I had been to a spot
[58:13] where I thought I was going to lose
[58:15] everything. But in that moment, I never
[58:18] started talking like I was broke. I
[58:20] didn't talk like I didn't I wasn't going
[58:22] to make it. I didn't talk like I was
[58:24] going to lose my home. I didn't talk
[58:25] like I was going to lose my business. I
[58:28] spoke from a spot of victory. I had $300
[58:32] left to my name. But I said, I'm busier
[58:35] than ever. I've got the victory. My
[58:38] business is growing. What if you started
[58:40] talking and started looking and started
[58:44] possessing instead of the part?
[58:46] Hallelujah.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Instead of where you're living at in the
[58:50] moment.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; What are you saying, brother Andrew? I'm
[58:53] saying you're going to see some giants.
[58:55] I'm saying in your marriage, there's
[58:57] going to be some giants on your job.
[58:59] There's going to be some giants in your
[59:01] health. There's going to be some giants.
[59:04] But I say this by the word of the Lord
[59:07] that faith conquers every giant.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; There is a place prepared
[59:18] for me.
[59:20] Look at your neighbor and say, "There is
[59:22] a place
[59:24] prepared
[59:26] for me." Now Jesus said in John 14 that
[59:30] if I go I will prepare a place for you
[59:34] that where I am there you may be also.
[59:38] Now you cannot talk me out of this verse
[59:41] three where he says if I go and prepare
[59:44] a place unto you that I will come again.
[59:48] Now, you can't talk me out of this
[59:50] because I really believe this with all
[59:52] of my heart that this is the Lord's
[59:55] coming. That I have prepared a place for
[59:58] you and I will come again in the
[1:00:01] brightcoming of Jesus Christ. I have
[1:00:04] come again to
[1:00:08] take you to the place that I prepared.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; What are you saying? I'm saying this
[1:00:14] message is your ticket. I'm saying this
[1:00:17] message is your token. I'm saying this
[1:00:19] message is your absolute to take you to
[1:00:23] the place that God has destined for you.
[1:00:26] If you started living like you was
[1:00:29] walking on streets of glory.
[1:00:33] If you started living like you was
[1:00:35] already in the battle and the battle was
[1:00:37] over and you had the crown.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Let me say this
[1:00:48] before you can ever live in that
[1:00:50] position.
[1:00:52] It's a beautiful place to live at.
[1:00:55] It's a beautiful place to live at. A
[1:00:58] place of milk and honey. A place of
[1:01:02] victory. A place where Israel does not
[1:01:05] lose a battle until sin slips in.
[1:01:10] A place a place where you don't know
[1:01:14] what it's like to be sick. A place where
[1:01:17] you do not know where you do not know
[1:01:19] what it's like to be tempted and to
[1:01:22] fall. A place. A place. Now you sound
[1:01:26] like, brother Andrew, you sound like
[1:01:27] you're talking about some figment of
[1:01:29] imagination. And you sound like you're
[1:01:31] talking about a fairy tale that that
[1:01:33] cannot happen. No, I'm absolutely not
[1:01:35] talking about some fairy tale. But I say
[1:01:37] this unto you that Jesus said in Isaiah
[1:01:40] 26 and3 that I will keep him in perfect
[1:01:43] peace whose mind is stayed on me. I say
[1:01:48] if you can live in the heavenlies, it
[1:01:50] doesn't minimize what you're going
[1:01:52] through. It doesn't minimize cancer. It
[1:01:54] doesn't minimize the troubles. It
[1:01:56] doesn't minimize anxiety. But the place
[1:01:59] that you're living,
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; that place, that place, that destiny,
[1:02:06] that position is what Satan is trying to
[1:02:09] keep you from.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Well, I still got this sticky nature. No
[1:02:15] kidding. I still have problems on my
[1:02:17] job. No kidding. But those things, like
[1:02:21] Paul said, none of them move me.
[1:02:24] Shipwreck don't move me. Cancer don't
[1:02:27] move me. Troubles don't move me.
[1:02:29] Sickness don't move me. Why? Because I'm
[1:02:32] not living.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Am I the only one that has that kind of
[1:02:36] mindset?
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Am I the only one that knows what it's
[1:02:40] like to live in a position where nothing
[1:02:43] can harm you?
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; I don't know about that, Brother Andrew.
[1:02:49] I know everything about it because it
[1:02:51] ain't my mindset.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; It's his.
[1:02:59] Well, Peter's a cussing preacher, but
[1:03:02] not in God's mind.
[1:03:04] He saw him as one of the lead disciples.
[1:03:08] Jonah was in a whale's belly, but not in
[1:03:12] God's mind. Daniel was praying for 21
[1:03:15] days, but not in God's mind. David was
[1:03:18] facing giants, but not in God's mind.
[1:03:22] Wanda was facing cancer, but not in
[1:03:24] God's mind. You was facing back
[1:03:27] problems, but not in God's mind.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Well, what are you saying? I'm saying if
[1:03:36] you're ever going to conquer a giant,
[1:03:38] you got to have the mindset of a
[1:03:40] warrior.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, goodness. I thought I was going to
[1:03:46] come back and have a conviction here,
[1:03:48] but instead we start talking about our
[1:03:51] problems.
[1:03:53] Now, this is the picture that I'm
[1:03:54] painting to you.
[1:03:56] I have painted you a picture where you
[1:03:59] really don't know whether you can amen
[1:04:00] this or not.
[1:04:03] Some of you are scared to death to say
[1:04:04] amen to that because you know as soon as
[1:04:07] you walk out of this building, trouble
[1:04:10] is going to meet you. Rejection is going
[1:04:13] to meet you. Family problems that you
[1:04:15] cannot restore are going to meet you.
[1:04:18] Troubles are going to face you.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; And you really don't know whether you
[1:04:24] can say amen
[1:04:26] to this or not because you still got
[1:04:30] giants.
[1:04:36] I want to say there is a place.
[1:04:40] There is a place
[1:04:43] my
[1:04:44] help me Jesus. You see,
[1:04:48] let me let me just paint the picture of
[1:04:51] you wearing a crown of victory. Let me
[1:04:55] paint the picture of you wearing the
[1:04:57] banner of the first one to finish a
[1:05:00] race. Let me paint the picture of the
[1:05:03] one that has a title of champion of
[1:05:06] champions and he slips it over on you.
[1:05:08] Let me paint the picture of a God that
[1:05:11] has slipped on your hands, the unmarited
[1:05:14] wedding band of grace. Let me paint the
[1:05:17] picture to you that you have got giants,
[1:05:22] but there is a place.
[1:05:26] And that place is where we want to get
[1:05:29] to that place. Because to be honest,
[1:05:33] Satan can whip us all around every other
[1:05:35] place. Satan can whip us around our
[1:05:38] emotions. Satan can whip us around our
[1:05:40] feelings. Satan can whip us on what we
[1:05:43] feel. But he cannot whip us in this
[1:05:48] place. And that is the place that is the
[1:05:51] place that I want to get to. That is the
[1:05:54] place where I want to live at. That is
[1:05:56] the place the place of my destiny. And
[1:06:00] Jesus said unto Moses, there is a place
[1:06:03] by me.
[1:06:07] Now, Satan is going to do everything
[1:06:10] within his power
[1:06:12] to keep you
[1:06:14] from there.
[1:06:16] There there
[1:06:19] we saw giants. And I want you to when
[1:06:22] you read that, I want you to put the
[1:06:23] emphasis. You cannot read the Bible like
[1:06:26] a newspaper. We just flip over it.
[1:06:30] Just read on. There's a lot of people
[1:06:33] that can read the Bible. There was a man
[1:06:35] that read the Bible in the message in 8
[1:06:37] hours, but I highly doubt that he
[1:06:39] retained everything that he read. You
[1:06:41] cannot read the Bible just like you read
[1:06:44] in Love magazine. You have got to read
[1:06:46] it between the lines because when Moses
[1:06:50] is writing this out in Numbers 13, it
[1:06:53] pains him to write out that his his
[1:06:56] constituents have come against him. They
[1:06:59] are turning against the very message
[1:07:01] that they have believed in.
[1:07:03] But there
[1:07:05] there there
[1:07:07] we saw giants. Now there we So it's more
[1:07:13] than just one of you that's saying
[1:07:15] cancer's real. It's more than one of you
[1:07:16] that's saying these giants are big. It's
[1:07:18] more than just it's more it's more than
[1:07:20] your feelings. It's it's it's a
[1:07:23] collaboration of people that are
[1:07:25] standing around you and say we saw them.
[1:07:29] But why there? There. Why did we see
[1:07:33] them there? Because this was the
[1:07:35] promised land. This was the place that
[1:07:38] God promised them that it was going to
[1:07:40] flow with milk and honey. This was their
[1:07:44] blessing
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; there.
[1:07:48] But it was also their battlefield.
[1:07:51] This place that I'm talking about you
[1:07:53] living in in a place of victory is the
[1:07:56] place that God has destined for you. But
[1:07:59] there is where Satan wants to keep you
[1:08:01] from. There is a place of decision.
[1:08:04] There is where 10 people saw giants and
[1:08:07] they started retreating in fear and they
[1:08:10] started pulling back and saying the days
[1:08:12] of miracles has passed. That God doesn't
[1:08:14] give the Holy Ghost no more and that God
[1:08:16] is no longer living amongst his people.
[1:08:19] But there two rose up instead of
[1:08:22] retreating in fear and they responded in
[1:08:25] faith.
[1:08:27] Why did these giants show up there?
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; They could have lived anywhere else.
[1:08:35] Them giants could have been outside
[1:08:36] their border and they never would have
[1:08:39] had to fear the God of the Israelites.
[1:08:44] But why does Satan like to get on your
[1:08:47] property?
[1:08:49] Because he wants to keep you from your
[1:08:51] victory.
[1:08:54] If I could say this, I know I got some
[1:08:57] of you scared, scared to death right
[1:08:59] now. You don't know whether to say amen
[1:09:00] or oh me. You are scared to death
[1:09:02] because you don't know where I'm going.
[1:09:04] But I want to show this to you. There is
[1:09:06] victory in front of you. No matter the
[1:09:08] giants that's in front of you. No matter
[1:09:10] the tuberculosis or the cancer or the
[1:09:13] fear or the anxiety or the rejection,
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; there is victory.
[1:09:24] There is a place where you got to make
[1:09:26] up your mind whether you're going with
[1:09:27] God
[1:09:29] or whether you're going to listen to
[1:09:30] your family, you going to listen to your
[1:09:32] friends, you either going to retreat or
[1:09:34] you're going to rise up. You're going to
[1:09:35] live in fear or you're going to live in
[1:09:37] faith. You are going to either be a
[1:09:38] grasshopper or you're going to be a
[1:09:40] giant killer. You got a decision right
[1:09:42] now.
[1:09:44] How many is going to say like Caleb, we
[1:09:47] are more
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; we are more than able.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; How many Calebs?
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; How many Calebs
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; are willing to say we are more
[1:10:05] than able?
[1:10:08] And brother Angel, I'm scared to death,
[1:10:11] but I'm not looking from my emotions.
[1:10:14] I'm not looking from my fear. I'm not
[1:10:16] looking from my position. I am looking
[1:10:19] through the revelation of God's word.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; It's amazing when you begin to study out
[1:10:28] Caleb's name.
[1:10:30] You begin to study out Joshua means
[1:10:31] Jehovah Savior. You begin to study out
[1:10:33] Dan. You begin to study out Reuben. And
[1:10:35] they have powerful meanings. But Caleb
[1:10:39] means
[1:10:40] a dog.
[1:10:43] A dog.
[1:10:45] A dog. A stinking low down dog.
[1:10:50] But God chooses a dog to show that he's
[1:10:54] bigger than giants.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; A dog. when others had powerful names,
[1:11:01] when others had a greater a greater
[1:11:03] stature,
[1:11:06] it's because God was going to raise up a
[1:11:10] bunch of gentile dogs
[1:11:13] to prove that they were gentile
[1:11:15] warriors. It doesn't matter what you
[1:11:17] call us. It doesn't matter where you try
[1:11:19] to send us to, but we before the
[1:11:22] foundation of the world was already seen
[1:11:25] in victory. Jesus stood there and was
[1:11:28] talking to a woman and said, "My gift
[1:11:30] was not sent unto you dogs."
[1:11:34] She tried to speak to him in the name of
[1:11:37] the son of David. She didn't have no
[1:11:40] claims on him as a gentile dog, as a son
[1:11:43] of David. But when she turned her
[1:11:46] attention and said, "But even so, my
[1:11:49] lord, the dogs get their crumbs from the
[1:11:52] master's table. Well, I might just be a
[1:11:55] dog, but I say one crumb.
[1:12:02] Want to put a flight a thousand and two
[1:12:04] 10,000.
[1:12:05] If I can get one crumb from the master's
[1:12:08] table, I know I receive my victory.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; You begin to study these giants. I have
[1:12:20] become fascinated
[1:12:23] on studying these things out
[1:12:26] these giants because everything has an
[1:12:30] origin
[1:12:32] except for God.
[1:12:35] Where
[1:12:37] did these giants come from?
[1:12:40] And the Bible said in Genesis chapter 6,
[1:12:45] there were giants in the land that
[1:12:50] looked on the sons of men and the
[1:12:53] daughters of men and they laid with him
[1:12:57] and there become to be men of great
[1:13:00] stature.
[1:13:01] Now we realize by the message that Adam
[1:13:05] was no giant.
[1:13:07] He was no giant. He was made in the very
[1:13:10] image of almighty God. But we realize
[1:13:13] that there was a certain affinity that
[1:13:16] laid when God was creating all the
[1:13:19] mammals of the earth. He created this
[1:13:22] serpent that was an upright beast in his
[1:13:25] nature. And brother Brandham said in the
[1:13:27] church age book, he said that Satan took
[1:13:30] advantage of the characteristics of the
[1:13:33] serpent. He said now he said in that
[1:13:36] time there could be an intermingling
[1:13:38] between a man and the animal. He said
[1:13:41] but God completely broke that. That's
[1:13:43] why science today is spending millions
[1:13:46] on top of millions trying to find that
[1:13:48] missing link. But I can take this KY's
[1:13:51] message. Hallelujah. And I can break
[1:13:54] down every bit of their walls of
[1:13:56] petition to try to say that we came from
[1:13:58] monkeys. I can look at a bunch of them
[1:14:00] and realize that they did come from
[1:14:02] monkeys.
[1:14:06] But where did these giants come from?
[1:14:10] This serpent, he was an upright beast
[1:14:12] that we know, and I'm not going to teach
[1:14:14] you complete serpency tonight, but we
[1:14:16] realize that he was a great stature of a
[1:14:19] being. And he had a certain affinity
[1:14:21] that he could come in and he could place
[1:14:23] his seed on the inside. He could borrow
[1:14:26] the body of this serpent and he could go
[1:14:29] in there and he could lay with Eve and
[1:14:31] Eve could produce a son by Cain. And
[1:14:35] many people don't realize that it was
[1:14:38] twins in the Bible. That it was Cain and
[1:14:42] Abel that was there, but one came from
[1:14:44] Cain.
[1:14:46] One came from the serpent, but one came
[1:14:48] from Adam. And when you study out the
[1:14:51] characteristics, you begin to see where
[1:14:53] these giants come from. Because when you
[1:14:56] start studying out the serpent's
[1:14:58] characteristics, you begin to trace him
[1:15:00] all the way back back to the Garden of
[1:15:04] Eden. When you start looking at Isaiah
[1:15:07] 14 and you start looking in there and
[1:15:10] you could see there he was hiding in
[1:15:14] Eden.
[1:15:16] Where did this booger come from?
[1:15:19] This is the one that worshiped Almighty
[1:15:23] God in the beginning. He got so close to
[1:15:26] God. He watched him create. He watched
[1:15:29] him manifest his glory. And this Lucifer
[1:15:32] wanted this power all to himself.
[1:15:37] But God said, "That's not for you.
[1:15:40] That's for another destiny."
[1:15:43] He longed for it. He wanted it. But he
[1:15:47] couldn't have it because God had it for
[1:15:50] you, Sister Devin.
[1:15:52] The thing that you have in your lips is
[1:15:55] greater than anything Lucifer will ever
[1:15:58] have.
[1:16:03] Brother Tom, when you get down and you
[1:16:06] pray, God blesses your ham biscuit and
[1:16:09] God blesses it.
[1:16:11] Turns that pork into heavenly
[1:16:17] Me and Brother Tom ain't real sure where
[1:16:20] the hand's going to be there or not, but
[1:16:21] we're sure hoping so.
[1:16:24] But when you bow on your knees and bless
[1:16:28] your fruit lips, fruit lips, fruit
[1:16:30] loops,
[1:16:33] you have more power than Satan will ever
[1:16:36] have.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Welcome back.
[1:16:39] I know you miss me,
[1:16:42] but could you imagine that you have the
[1:16:45] ability by just giving thanksgiving over
[1:16:47] your meal is more than Olu ever had
[1:16:53] than old Slooh Foot ever had. The
[1:16:56] ability to create,
[1:17:01] he's never attained this ability
[1:17:06] and he's longing for it. and he starts
[1:17:09] moving his way into God's creation,
[1:17:12] trying to conquer this creation. But all
[1:17:16] he can ever do is pervert it. All he can
[1:17:19] ever do is try to stop it from growing.
[1:17:22] But God has a place,
[1:17:25] a place set up for you. And no matter
[1:17:29] what you come up against, no matter what
[1:17:32] you face, you have the ability to speak
[1:17:36] one name.
[1:17:38] and get out of trouble.
[1:17:41] Can you imagine your abilities that when
[1:17:44] you get in trouble on your job and when
[1:17:46] you get in trouble in the spiritual
[1:17:47] realm that all you have to do is whisper
[1:17:50] the name of Jesus and it gets you out of
[1:17:53] your problems.
[1:17:57] one name, one time, one whisper.
[1:18:01] But a whole band of Christian soldiers
[1:18:05] can come in against a demon of cancer
[1:18:08] and it can whisper. It can whisper to
[1:18:11] diabetes. It can whisper sugar. It can
[1:18:14] whisper blood pressure. And it can try
[1:18:16] to combine all of its power. But it
[1:18:20] never has the ability to break the
[1:18:22] stronghold of a Christian.
[1:18:31] When you study the word giant out in the
[1:18:34] scripture
[1:18:36] in the Hebrew it is nephel which means a
[1:18:39] tyrant. It means a faller. One that is a
[1:18:44] bully. One that causes to fall. And when
[1:18:48] you begin to watch the characteristics
[1:18:50] of the fall and you begin to watch the
[1:18:53] characteristics of Numbers 13, you will
[1:18:56] see that this bully in Genesis is the
[1:19:01] same bully that is in different bodies
[1:19:05] in Numbers 13
[1:19:09] because Satan needs a body to move him.
[1:19:15] Notice
[1:19:16] we realize
[1:19:18] that that brother Mam comes in and shows
[1:19:21] us a heavenly view because Josephus
[1:19:23] begins to tell us that this was a fallen
[1:19:26] angel that fell on this one and created
[1:19:28] and they begin to lie in and press their
[1:19:30] self against human flesh and all of a
[1:19:32] sudden all of a sudden they come in
[1:19:34] there and they created they created
[1:19:36] these great big giants. But a prophet
[1:19:39] takes prophetic vision and goes back in
[1:19:41] there shows that it was complete serpent
[1:19:43] seed and it come from the offspring of
[1:19:45] Cain and all the way down. You see, it's
[1:19:48] important to note where these giants
[1:19:51] came from and where these giants started
[1:19:53] from. And it takes a prophetic vision to
[1:19:56] be able to trace it out and show where
[1:19:58] it started out. He came in this hour and
[1:20:01] he traced out where the Trinity started
[1:20:03] out. He traced where cancer started out.
[1:20:05] He traced that it started all the way
[1:20:07] back there in the nin council with the
[1:20:09] trinity and he began to come in there
[1:20:11] and he stand before a patient and said I
[1:20:13] see you've got this nervousness on you
[1:20:15] and he begins to trace it all the way
[1:20:17] back.
[1:20:19] I see you you was getting off a school
[1:20:22] bus and he was running away from a
[1:20:24] yellow dog and ever since that time you
[1:20:26] have been you have been afflicted with
[1:20:29] this nervousness. What was it? He was
[1:20:31] showing the origin of where these giants
[1:20:36] or where this demon came from. And
[1:20:38] brother Brandham said in Israel in the
[1:20:40] church, he said, "The greatest thing
[1:20:42] that I can find against the church
[1:20:44] tonight is fear."
[1:20:46] He said, "Everybody is scared to death
[1:20:48] about something. What are you scared
[1:20:50] about?" He said, "If a man's born again,
[1:20:53] he should be happy, carefree, just like
[1:20:55] these fellas singing up here and this
[1:20:58] brother testifying back there, just
[1:21:00] free." He said, "There ain't nothing can
[1:21:01] harm you, nothing present, nothing
[1:21:04] future, nothing can separate us from the
[1:21:06] love of God that is in Christ Jesus
[1:21:08] because God has promised it." You've got
[1:21:12] to remind yourself that God made you to
[1:21:15] be happy, that God made you to be free,
[1:21:18] that God made you to be in a position
[1:21:20] where you could have the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:26] You imagine,
[1:21:29] let me just let me paint it.
[1:21:33] And here is these 12. You study out 12.
[1:21:37] It's very powerful where God sends 12
[1:21:39] because God when God sends out 12, it is
[1:21:43] his perfect government in a complete
[1:21:46] authority. And he sends out 12. And you
[1:21:49] can imagine they have worked their way
[1:21:51] from Cadesh to Bon all the way through
[1:21:53] the wilderness. and they're walking with
[1:21:55] the prophet. They are walking in step
[1:21:57] and they are discerning the Lord's body.
[1:21:59] They're moving their self way right into
[1:22:01] the rapture and complete communion. And
[1:22:03] here's 12 of the most powerful and
[1:22:06] precious sons of God. And they're back
[1:22:08] there and they're sunburnt. And they
[1:22:11] come out upon the very ridge of Canaan.
[1:22:14] And they start looking over top of
[1:22:16] Canaan. And they start seeing the lust
[1:22:18] valleys of Canaan. They start out in
[1:22:20] Cadesh, which is God's judgment seat,
[1:22:22] and they move over and they see the
[1:22:24] giants over there in Hebrin. And then
[1:22:26] they move over in the valley of Escal
[1:22:29] where they grab the clusters of grapes
[1:22:31] from, and they begin to move into the
[1:22:33] land. And they begin to move in there.
[1:22:36] And they started looking over the land.
[1:22:38] And they started hiding maybe behind
[1:22:40] some bushes. And they started looking,
[1:22:43] and they begin to see these great big
[1:22:45] old giants over there.
[1:22:48] Now the Bible when it talks about giants
[1:22:51] could refer to them anywhere from being
[1:22:53] 9 foot to 12t tall. When you look at the
[1:22:56] king of Og and Bashan, you begin to look
[1:22:59] at it. The Bible gives his his his his
[1:23:02] measurements on how big his bed is. It's
[1:23:06] a bed that's 13 1/2t 13 and 1/2t long, 9
[1:23:10] foot wide. He's a big old giant of a man
[1:23:13] that lives inside of that bed. And here
[1:23:17] these 12 sunburnt sons of God are
[1:23:21] standing back there and they start
[1:23:23] walking and they start looking and they
[1:23:26] see great big old statures of a giant
[1:23:31] walking through the land. Let me remind
[1:23:34] you where they're walking. They're
[1:23:36] walking on Isaiah 53. They are walking
[1:23:38] on 1 John 4 and4. They are walking on
[1:23:41] Isaiah 54. They are walking They are
[1:23:43] walking over Malachi 4. They are walking
[1:23:46] over top of John 3:16
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; and they're walking on your inheritance.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; And you can imagine just a big old 9
[1:23:57] foot n giant of a guy starts walking
[1:23:59] out. He starts making his way and
[1:24:02] they're hiding praying, "Dear God, don't
[1:24:05] let him see us."
[1:24:07] And one looks over at the other said,
[1:24:10] "Are we supposed to fight them?
[1:24:15] And all of a sudden they started
[1:24:18] whispering fear into their testimony.
[1:24:22] That moment,
[1:24:24] that moment right there was the moment
[1:24:28] they started seeing fear instead of
[1:24:30] opportunities. They started seeing
[1:24:32] giants instead of God's promises. They
[1:24:35] started seeing warriors instead of
[1:24:37] instead of looking back and seeing that
[1:24:39] he was a God that split the Red Sea. He
[1:24:41] was a god that rained down mana. He was
[1:24:43] a god that raised four and a half foot
[1:24:45] of quail that would stand there
[1:24:49] because a giant of fear was standing
[1:24:54] right in front of them. What were they
[1:24:56] looking through? They were looking
[1:24:58] through the eyes or the filter of a
[1:25:01] thinking man instead of God's word. You
[1:25:05] see, when you begin to put on Satan's
[1:25:08] glasses and you start looking through
[1:25:10] the filter of Satan, you begin to see
[1:25:13] you begin to see sickness instead of
[1:25:15] healing. You begin to see weakness
[1:25:17] instead of power. You begin to see
[1:25:19] battles instead of victories.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; But when you take it off,
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; when you take off Satan's filter and you
[1:25:28] take off Satan's glasses, you begin to
[1:25:30] look and see, by his stripes, I am
[1:25:33] healed. You shall receive power after
[1:25:35] the Holy Ghost has come upon you. You
[1:25:38] begin to see. Thanks God. Thanks be to
[1:25:40] God. That gives us the victory.
[1:25:45] The giant didn't change. The world
[1:25:47] didn't change. The problems didn't
[1:25:49] change.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Your vision did.
[1:25:54] You see, that's what I appreciate about
[1:25:56] the message of the hour is that it give
[1:25:58] us a heavenly eyesight
[1:26:02] to realize the place that we are
[1:26:04] destined to be in.
[1:26:09] You realize the place that God has
[1:26:11] destined for you is a place of an
[1:26:13] overcomer.
[1:26:15] that the very last thing he says to you
[1:26:18] in this church age is blessed is he that
[1:26:21] overcomemeth that I will grant to sit
[1:26:23] with him in my throne.
[1:26:27] There's a place brother man paints it
[1:26:29] out perfectly in in how to overcome. He
[1:26:33] begins to point out to overcome is to
[1:26:37] recognize the devil in every one of his
[1:26:39] tricks. It begins to paint it out on how
[1:26:42] we are to overcome. It's to keep life on
[1:26:44] the inside of us and that there is a
[1:26:47] position of a believer. And you're going
[1:26:50] to look through Ephesians 1 and
[1:26:51] Ephesians 2 and you can see the
[1:26:53] believer's position.
[1:26:56] You say, "Well, brother Andrew, I I
[1:26:57] don't I don't have that kind of a
[1:26:58] mindset like you."
[1:27:01] Let me say this.
[1:27:03] What voice are you listening to?
[1:27:07] Because you read in Numbers 13, and I'm
[1:27:09] not I I I I just want to follow this
[1:27:12] thought out just for a minute. You begin
[1:27:14] to look at that and they begin to talk
[1:27:18] from the giants's point of view. But you
[1:27:21] roll forward into Joshua chapter 2 and
[1:27:24] you start hearing the voice of an
[1:27:25] insider. You begin to hear Rahab's voice
[1:27:29] rise up and she begins to speak out and
[1:27:31] said, "We are all in a place of terror
[1:27:35] because of your God."
[1:27:39] Whose voice are you going to listen to?
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; The devil's voice or God's voice?
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; If God is telling you that you're not
[1:27:49] big enough and not strong enough and not
[1:27:51] able enough, it's because he's trying to
[1:27:53] keep you from a position. If he's trying
[1:27:56] to say you're going to die in cancer,
[1:27:58] he's trying to keep you from your
[1:27:59] victory. If he's going to say that you
[1:28:01] will never live to overcome it, he's
[1:28:04] trying to keep you from your mountain.
[1:28:06] Because Caleb had a destiny in front of
[1:28:09] him and there was nothing going to keep
[1:28:12] him from it. There was not a giant that
[1:28:14] was going to keep him from it. There was
[1:28:15] not a circumstance that was going to
[1:28:17] keep him from it. Leotil is not going to
[1:28:20] keep me from the rapture. I'm going
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; whether you want to go, whether the
[1:28:26] devil wants me to go or not, I'm going
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; because I was destined before the
[1:28:31] foundation of the world to go.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Somebody sent me this very powerful sent
[1:28:40] me this this past week
[1:28:42] that you can buy steak from a butcher
[1:28:45] and it's $7. You can go to a supermarket
[1:28:49] and you can buy that same steak for $10.
[1:28:52] You can go you can go to your local
[1:28:54] restaurant and you can get that same
[1:28:56] steak for $25. Or you can go to a
[1:28:59] high-end restaurant and you can buy that
[1:29:01] same steak for $150.
[1:29:04] The only thing that changed was the
[1:29:06] location.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; The steak was the same. And if you are
[1:29:10] not seeing the value that you are in
[1:29:13] God's mind, you just need to get into
[1:29:16] another place.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; You're not poor in God's mind. You're
[1:29:25] not broke in God's wealth. You're not
[1:29:27] defeated in God's mind.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; You just need to change your dwelling
[1:29:31] place.
[1:29:34] There
[1:29:36] we saw giants.
[1:29:42] Let me just fast forward this for a
[1:29:43] minute.
[1:29:45] Where they saw him was in the place of
[1:29:48] promise.
[1:29:50] They saw him in the place where your
[1:29:53] prodals are coming home.
[1:29:55] In the place where cancer leaves your
[1:29:57] body.
[1:29:59] Where have these giants been?
[1:30:05] Now God had already promised to Abraham
[1:30:08] that his seed was going to sojourn the
[1:30:09] land and Satan was standing real close.
[1:30:11] And when he heard where that seed was
[1:30:14] going to be, Satan begin to inherit that
[1:30:17] land.
[1:30:19] But I love what brother Brandham says in
[1:30:20] the restoration of the bride tree that
[1:30:22] you have been given redemptive rights to
[1:30:26] enforce your God-given claim on the Holy
[1:30:28] Ghost and on your promises. That
[1:30:31] mothers, this is your place. That
[1:30:33] fathers, this is your place. The reason
[1:30:36] why there are giants there is because
[1:30:40] that is the greatest land.
[1:30:46] When you look at Joshua chapter 10 and
[1:30:49] you see where Joshua is fighting this
[1:30:51] battle against these k these 10 kings,
[1:30:54] the reason why they're fighting there is
[1:30:56] because this is the boundary of Dan.
[1:30:59] This is his land. This is the eagle
[1:31:02] anointing's boundary. And this is where
[1:31:04] giants. The most giants in the land
[1:31:06] today are against the message of the
[1:31:08] hour.
[1:31:10] I'll be honest with you, them giants
[1:31:12] ain't attacking. They ain't attacking
[1:31:14] that formalism. They ain't attacking
[1:31:16] that what you see on YouTube as true as
[1:31:19] what they call real worship. Men that
[1:31:21] look like men that look like they just
[1:31:23] broke out of jail. And they are the
[1:31:24] leading they are the leading Christian
[1:31:26] artist of this day.
[1:31:29] Satan ain't attacking them when they
[1:31:31] start singing their songs. Satan ain't
[1:31:33] attacking them the way they do and the
[1:31:34] way they worship. And I appreciate them,
[1:31:37] but I I I appreciate the gift. But
[1:31:39] really, that anointing that they're
[1:31:41] grabbing a hold of is your anointing.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; That's your anointing, young people. You
[1:31:46] can listen to them Christian music, and
[1:31:48] I want you to know that the anointing
[1:31:50] that they are running off of is a
[1:31:51] bride's anointing. And if they can get
[1:31:54] anointed in such a way to write songs
[1:31:57] and to sing and to praise God and to and
[1:32:00] to write motivationals and and to preach
[1:32:02] gospel like never, they are running off
[1:32:04] of our anointing.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; And if they can do that,
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; now you're going to hear me preach
[1:32:11] without me say anything. If they can do
[1:32:13] that,
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; if they can do that, what are you doing
[1:32:17] with your anointing?
[1:32:22] Come on, somebody. God didn't raise up
[1:32:24] Brandon Reed just to give him an
[1:32:26] anointing to write certain songs. He
[1:32:29] raised up this bride to grab a hold of a
[1:32:33] message anointing and run it and sing
[1:32:35] songs and to preach this message and get
[1:32:38] our prodals and heal the sick.
[1:32:42] [Applause]
[1:32:47] I watched the I watched the interview
[1:32:49] this weekend. It troubled me.
[1:32:53] You know, I'm sure you're all aware of
[1:32:56] the uh of the chosen series that they
[1:33:00] put out. And the man that plays Jesus is
[1:33:02] a Catholic in his background.
[1:33:06] And I'll be honest, I I really feel like
[1:33:08] they have captured some of the message
[1:33:10] of the hour in that.
[1:33:13] I'm not making a doctor out of that. I
[1:33:15] just I when you hear brother Brandham
[1:33:17] and you start Jesus discerning the woman
[1:33:19] at the well, you begin to look at that
[1:33:20] like, man, that's exactly what we've
[1:33:23] watched in this generation.
[1:33:25] When I watched this interview this week
[1:33:26] of I don't know his name, uh this Jesus,
[1:33:30] the guy that played Jesus, Jonathan
[1:33:32] Roomie, something like that. He has he's
[1:33:35] given this interview and he said there
[1:33:38] was a woman that came in there into the
[1:33:40] interview after he was after he was
[1:33:41] doing his thing and they they brought in
[1:33:43] a a woman and her daughter or child was
[1:33:46] was paralyzed and had a condition. She
[1:33:49] started talking about certain scenes in
[1:33:51] the chosen started talking about these
[1:33:53] things and she said, "I got to thinking,
[1:33:57] wouldn't it be neat? Wouldn't it be neat
[1:34:00] if he could do if you could do the same
[1:34:02] thing? if God could do the same thing
[1:34:04] right here for my little girl.
[1:34:07] And he had a right response. He said,
[1:34:09] "Well, I don't know what you're looking
[1:34:10] for." He said, "But as far as I know, I
[1:34:12] don't have that kind of gift."
[1:34:15] And he prayed with him. But it reminded
[1:34:17] me about when Billy Graham was over
[1:34:20] there overseas
[1:34:22] and the Muhammad tried to talk him down
[1:34:26] and said, "If your God is really God,
[1:34:27] then why don't he heal this and why
[1:34:28] don't he do that and why don't he do
[1:34:29] that?"
[1:34:31] Billy Graham ran back to the United
[1:34:33] States. Didn't have an answer for them.
[1:34:35] And William Brown stood. He said, "I can
[1:34:37] tell you this. I don't know what I'd
[1:34:39] done." He said, "But I would have stood
[1:34:41] there anyway and said, I know whether
[1:34:43] God will do it or not. I don't know
[1:34:44] whether he'll do it or not. But I do
[1:34:46] know this. I know he's more than able. I
[1:34:48] know he's still the same yesterday,
[1:34:49] today, and forever."
[1:34:52] I say this, the reason why the devil's
[1:34:56] trying to keep you off of this message
[1:34:58] is there. We saw giants.
[1:35:01] But if that is where we see them at,
[1:35:04] that is where we slay them at, that is
[1:35:06] where we kill them at, that is where we
[1:35:09] destroy them at, there we saw giants
[1:35:13] fall.
[1:35:15] There in this message, there in your
[1:35:18] prayer life, there in your worship,
[1:35:21] there
[1:35:25] right there.
[1:35:29] God bless you. Let's stand
[1:35:35] there.
[1:35:41] We
[1:35:43] saw giant
[1:35:54] Hallelujah.
[1:35:56] Hallelujah.
[1:35:58] Won't you love the Lord with all your
[1:35:59] heart?
[1:36:02] If fear is standing right there,
[1:36:06] that's your place of faith.
[1:36:08] If he I if if sickness is standing right
[1:36:11] there, that's your place of healing.
[1:36:16] right there.
[1:36:20] I want you to I want this to be real
[1:36:22] real to you because I'm going somewhere
[1:36:23] in the coming weeks is that God is
[1:36:26] wanting to borrow somebody that
[1:36:28] recognizes they're there.
[1:36:32] I I want you to realize where's my
[1:36:34] greatest battles at.
[1:36:40] I'm not going to whisper it because I
[1:36:43] just don't want to go there.
[1:36:48] But you know where your giants are.
[1:36:52] If you can ever recognize
[1:36:54] when the giant starts raising his head.
[1:36:56] Well, I'll just say it so nobody's not
[1:36:58] sitting around wondering why. My brother
[1:36:59] Andrew's got some real time. You watch.
[1:37:03] My giant is against worship.
[1:37:10] The giants attack the way I worship.
[1:37:13] They attack the way I praise. They
[1:37:15] attack the way I love. They attack the
[1:37:18] way I preach. I know where my giants
[1:37:20] are.
[1:37:22] You know where your giants are. Whether
[1:37:25] it's sin, maybe it's bitterness,
[1:37:30] maybe you deal with unforgiving spirits.
[1:37:32] All of a sudden, that giant rises up
[1:37:36] there, there there
[1:37:39] young people, you know what you face on
[1:37:42] Instagram, YouTube, and all those
[1:37:44] different things. Not even I'm not even
[1:37:46] trying to get there, but you know where
[1:37:47] that there is.
[1:37:50] But if that is where you are facing your
[1:37:52] giant, that's where your battle becomes
[1:37:55] your victory. Amen.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; If you can turn your there into a place
[1:38:00] of victory,
[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; I say it's some David's in this place.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; I say it's some Caleb's in this place.
[1:38:10] If you can turn your there into your
[1:38:12] victory, then God will receive the
[1:38:14] glory. No matter how bad you got to
[1:38:17] fight him, it might take you one day, it
[1:38:19] might take you two day, it might take
[1:38:20] you three day, but you going to whip
[1:38:22] them giants.
[1:38:23] When you start studying the book of
[1:38:25] Judges, I tell you, it's a powerful
[1:38:28] thing when you study it out because the
[1:38:31] Bible said that God left the giants in
[1:38:35] the land to teach them war.
[1:38:42] If you study it real closely, he says to
[1:38:45] prove Israel.
[1:38:47] Your giant
[1:38:49] is only here to prove what you really
[1:38:51] are.
[1:38:53] You realize that the giant of cancer
[1:38:55] stepped in to prove who brother Ron is?
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that the giant of debt
[1:39:01] stepped into your life to try to conquer
[1:39:04] you to prove that God could prove who
[1:39:06] you really are? If you got debt, get
[1:39:10] ready. The giant of debt is getting
[1:39:13] ready to be your place of blessing.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; If you got fear, get ready to turn that
[1:39:18] giant over and see faith written
[1:39:20] underneath of his foot.
[1:39:23] Turn him over and watch your battle
[1:39:27] become your greatest testimony.
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; I see you, Giant. I see you, Goliath.
[1:39:36] 9 foot n 200 lb of brass
[1:39:41] helmet 2 in thick.
[1:39:45] If Goliath only realized that he was
[1:39:48] getting ready to be David's greatest
[1:39:50] testimony, he'd have never walked in
[1:39:52] that valley.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Sister Wanda, you are going to win.
[1:39:59] There may be other people that die in
[1:40:01] cancer, but you're going to win.
[1:40:06] I'd say if cancer knew what it was
[1:40:09] asking for when it come knocking on your
[1:40:11] door
[1:40:13] that it was going to be your testimony
[1:40:16] that God is the God of giants in Lelaya.
[1:40:20] He never walked into this valley.
[1:40:23] But because you did, I got a rock.
[1:40:27] I got a rock that has never lost. A rock
[1:40:31] that'll never never never never
[1:40:35] come on. I got a rock with your name on
[1:40:38] it.
[1:40:43] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:40:46] How many has recognized that they're
[1:40:48] there
[1:40:50] is their victory?
[1:40:52] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let me
[1:40:54] have a key of Jesus.
[1:40:59] Oh, he kept me alive. The Lord has kept
[1:41:02] me alive. Oh, through all the years,
[1:41:05] he's kept me alive. Well, I'm just as
[1:41:09] strong as the day that he sent me. Oh,
[1:41:12] even though the devil thought I'd give
[1:41:14] up, I'd never survive.

[1:41:24] me alive. Well, through all the years

[1:41:36] up, he never survived.
[1:41:40] The Lord has kept me alive.
[1:41:44] We know Caleb was a man who was there
[1:41:46] from the start. He followed the Lord
[1:41:50] with all of his heart. He's the one who
[1:41:53] said we're more than able to take the
[1:41:56] land.
[1:42:00] Well, he came through the wilderness
[1:42:03] through.
[1:42:05] He even seen a lot of people fall into
[1:42:08] sin. But after it all, he wanted
[1:42:11] everyone to understand.
[1:42:16] Oh, he kept me alive. The Lord has kept
[1:42:20] me alive and through all the years he's
[1:42:23] kept me alive. Well, I'm just as strong
[1:42:27] as the day that he sent me. Well, even
[1:42:30] though the devil thought I'd give up, I
[1:42:33] never survived.
[1:42:36] The Lord has kept me alive.
[1:42:39] Will I look at the years, the victories
[1:42:43] won? I stand amazed at all God has done.
[1:42:48] Now, who shall we fear were more than
[1:42:51] able to take the land?
[1:42:55] Oh,
[1:42:57] all the storms who wither, the giants
[1:43:00] have fail. We've been at war with Satan.
[1:43:03] The powers will fail. But by the grace
[1:43:06] of God, we're standing here. We're here
[1:43:09] to tell.
[1:43:13] Just keep me alive. This kept me alive
[1:43:18] through all the years. This kept me
[1:43:20] alive. Well, I'm just as strong as the
[1:43:24] day that he sent me. Even though the
[1:43:27] devil thought I'd give up.
[1:43:33] The Lord's.
[1:43:35] Now look at your neighbor through the
[1:43:37] lens of victory and say, "The Lord has
[1:43:40] kept me alive for a purpose.
[1:43:45] Some of y'all ain't looking at your
[1:43:47] neighbor. Some of y'all don't believe
[1:43:48] it.
[1:43:50] Tell your neighbor, "The Lord kept me
[1:43:52] alive for a purpose.
