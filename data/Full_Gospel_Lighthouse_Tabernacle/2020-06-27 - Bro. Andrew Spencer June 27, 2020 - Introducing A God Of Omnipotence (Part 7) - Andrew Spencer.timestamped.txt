[34:29] sanctified and filled with the Holy
[34:31] Ghost and he's your brother hey man

[49:56] I definitely want to be remembering
[49:58] sister Karen Pruitt in prayer there in a
[50:01] hospital this evening and they have been
[50:04] lifting our hands up as a church for the
[50:07] last five six months and and just
[50:11] distorting our hearts up and and all of
[50:14] those things that they've sent us every
[50:16] word of encouragement we would turn
[50:17] right around and send them right back to
[50:19] them we don't envy any person for any
[50:22] battle they're going through but we can
[50:24] sure enter in for them and understand
[50:25] the emotions of all the things that
[50:27] they're the families going through and
[50:29] we know that God has got all things in
[50:32] control so we just want to be
[50:33] remembering sister Karen and brother Tim
[50:36] this evening before we read this evening
[50:39] let's speak to the author of the word
[50:42] dear Heavenly Father we come before your
[50:45] holy presence Lord just now knowing and
[50:48] realizing what your word has said that
[50:50] that where two or three are gathered in
[50:53] my name there you will be father and we
[50:56] sense your nearness and the the the
[50:58] mighty angel is here the mighty angel is
[51:01] moving in our midst and we're seeing the
[51:04] the effects of the angel as as he is
[51:07] troubled the waters and we see those
[51:08] that have stepped in and become a part
[51:11] of the the moving of the spirit father I
[51:14] pray tonight that you would just allow
[51:16] that healing angel to go through the
[51:18] land
[51:19] search all this land over father the 16
[51:22] elements the father that stand before
[51:24] you Lord the 16 elements the Lord Jesus
[51:27] that you created a vessel and brother on
[51:29] Spencer and sister Karen Pruitt and all
[51:32] of your children the needs that have
[51:34] been lifted up to you we realize oh god
[51:36] that you've not changed your ideas
[51:39] you've not changed your thoughts you've
[51:41] not changed your word nor your stance
[51:43] Lord you're not changing your attitude
[51:46] towards us your children tonight and
[51:48] Lord we pray that we would just enter
[51:50] into the mindset of the Lord and that we
[51:52] would find the very channel of the Holy
[51:54] Ghost just now that you might speak to
[51:57] us lip to ear father lord I pray that
[52:00] you would come and calm the troubled
[52:02] waters of
[52:03] your children's lives I pray that you
[52:05] would speak lip to hear to them on in
[52:07] every situation that they're going
[52:09] through we pray that you would be God to
[52:11] them I pray as the word would go forth
[52:14] this evening that you would be magnified
[52:16] and praised and may you receive glory
[52:19] and honor for in all of these things
[52:21] that will be done may they be done in
[52:23] the name of Jesus Christ we pray these
[52:27] things amen
[52:29] Romans chapter 10 and verse eight but
[52:32] what saith it the word is nigh thee even
[52:36] in thy mouth and in thy heart that is
[52:40] the Word of Faith which we preach that
[52:42] if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[52:45] Lord Jesus and shalt believe in that
[52:47] heart that God has raised him from the
[52:51] dead thou shalt be saved
[52:54] for with the heart man believeth unto
[52:56] righteousness and with the mouth
[52:58] confession is made unto salvation for
[53:01] the scripture saith whosoever believeth
[53:03] on him shall not be ashamed for there is
[53:06] no difference between the Jew and the
[53:08] Greek for the same lord over all is rich
[53:11] unto all that call upon him for
[53:15] whosoever calleth upon the name of the
[53:17] Lord shall be saved
[53:20] god bless his word he may be seated in
[53:23] the presence of the Lord this this
[53:25] evening we've been speaking to you the
[53:28] last few weeks here on on introducing
[53:31] introducing the God of omnipotence and
[53:34] just to bring it to your memory you
[53:36] remember in the second-handed role he
[53:39] said now if I'm introducing a god that's
[53:42] omnipotent and all-powerful and if I be
[53:44] a servant of God I must do the works of
[53:46] God and if I do the works of God I must
[53:49] be a man of God to bring these things to
[53:52] pass because he's demanding of me to
[53:55] produce the impossible I have to ask him
[53:58] I have to call upon him and stand there
[54:00] and say God you promised it and so do
[54:03] you every person we've been speaking
[54:05] these things and introducing it and
[54:07] bringing before your your eyesight and
[54:10] that that you might see with a clearer
[54:12] vision
[54:12] that the God that we are serving is not
[54:15] a dead God he's not a God that that is
[54:18] just waiting or he's not sitting back
[54:21] he's a God that is ever present and that
[54:24] these things that have been spoken to us
[54:26] are very pertinent for this hour that
[54:28] that but they angel told us to go to
[54:31] take that book and eat the book and
[54:34] become that book and that but the owl
[54:36] must prophesy again and we are to speak
[54:39] what the word says and to fill our mouth
[54:42] with what the Word of God says and wewe
[54:45] said it like Paul said and David said we
[54:48] believe and therefore we speak but as I
[54:51] was preaching last weekend and ages the
[54:54] Spirit of the Lord dropped in my heart
[54:55] you cannot speak what is not in your
[54:59] heart you can have all the words to say
[55:02] you can have everything in line you can
[55:05] know all the scriptures but if it's not
[55:07] in your heart if all it is is a head
[55:11] knowledge and all of it is it's just
[55:13] well I went to church I gathered this
[55:15] information but you see the things that
[55:18] are in your heart are the things that
[55:20] you will speak and the things that you
[55:22] will do so we realize that before we can
[55:26] ever speak these things that there's got
[55:28] to be a change in the heart where the
[55:32] Bible said jesus said in Luke 16 and 44
[55:35] for every tree is known by his own fruit
[55:38] for off of thorns men do gather figs nor
[55:43] add nor a a bramble bush gather they
[55:45] grapes a good man out of the good
[55:48] treasure of his heart brings it forth
[55:50] that which is good and an evil man out
[55:52] of the evil treasure of his heart
[55:54] bringeth forth that which is evil for
[55:57] the abundance of the heart his mouth
[56:02] speaketh we realized that the heart
[56:06] controls our speech that those things
[56:09] that are down on the inside of your
[56:11] heart are the things that you'll say now
[56:13] anybody can say certain words or just to
[56:16] gather the attention of a preacher or
[56:18] gatherer the attentions of a other
[56:20] Christian or somebody that you're around
[56:22] or can adapt
[56:23] themselves or I will become like a
[56:26] chameleon and just kind of camouflage
[56:28] themselves into certain situations but
[56:31] really it comes down to a heart issue if
[56:34] you have got things right in your heart
[56:37] those things in what you will be is what
[56:40] you will speak so we realize that
[56:43] there's got to be a change a witness of
[56:45] the Holy Ghost on the inside of your
[56:47] life of your heart to to show and to
[56:50] prove what is on the inside of the heart
[56:52] and no man can take these words and
[56:55] produce these words unless deity be in
[56:57] him and Diaz he speaks so we realize
[57:00] that there's got to be something that is
[57:03] that is greater than just a spot of
[57:05] sanctification or there's got to be
[57:07] something greater than just coming to
[57:09] the altar there's got to be a move of
[57:11] God that that transplants our thinking
[57:15] and we begin to take on his thinking
[57:18] that we no longer think our thoughts
[57:20] that we no longer do our deeds that we
[57:22] no longer try to act on our own but he
[57:24] takes over a complete and supreme
[57:27] control and has the preeminence in our
[57:29] life for we know that when the Prophet
[57:32] stood there in the future home that he
[57:34] would draw out on the blackboard that
[57:36] there was a human heart and he said now
[57:38] I'm not much of a heart an artist but he
[57:40] said now here's a human heart and on the
[57:42] inside of that human heart is a snake
[57:44] and he said over here on the other side
[57:46] is a human heart and on the inside of
[57:48] that as a dove he said which represents
[57:51] which represents the Holy Ghost now all
[57:53] of us were born with that snake in our
[57:56] heart and you say well you say well I
[57:59] repented of my sins and I did these
[58:02] deeds you see that snake is still there
[58:05] until you get the root of the thing out
[58:09] of your heart so a man a man can confess
[58:13] his sins and a man can do those things
[58:16] but until he is completely born-again
[58:19] from above all of those things are there
[58:22] now you start in a work of repentance
[58:24] and an start of a work of sanctification
[58:26] and move on into the baptism of the Holy
[58:29] Ghost but until you get the root of the
[58:32] thing out are you with me you can spray
[58:35] the weeds but until you get the
[58:37] rude out it can pop right back up so you
[58:39] can see you've got to deal with the
[58:41] thing on the inside of the heart is that
[58:46] Alright
[58:46] anybody can rattle off at the mouth
[58:49] anybody can quote scriptures anybody can
[58:51] quote the message but it's got to go
[58:53] deeper than that
[58:54] it's got to go beyond the surface it's
[58:57] got to go beyond intellectual faith now
[59:00] you with me anybody that's set here for
[59:02] as a child could sit here and tell you
[59:05] these stories and tell you what the
[59:06] prophets had it tell you what the
[59:08] Bible's had but I'm not looking for
[59:10] intellectual faith intellectual faith
[59:13] only will do for you is make you a
[59:15] better citizen but if you receive the
[59:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost and a
[59:20] transplant and be completely transformed
[59:23] with the renewing of your mind that you
[59:25] no longer think the thoughts that you
[59:27] think but you start thinking his
[59:29] thoughts it must take a change of the
[59:33] heart if your mind and heart and all
[59:39] doesn't agree with God's Word and
[59:40] believe that he's the same Lord Jesus
[59:43] resurrected from the dead and peace in
[59:45] your heart and yet you belong to church
[59:47] be careful you might have a perverted
[59:51] mind instead of a changed heart hallelu
[59:59] you remember that powerful three-letter
[1:00:03] scripture that Jesus dropped to us and
[1:00:05] every child can remember remember Lot's
[1:00:11] wife all those three little words can
[1:00:16] tell you a story they can tell you who
[1:00:19] she was they can tell you they can tell
[1:00:21] you where she was but it also tells you
[1:00:23] where she was left standing at you see
[1:00:26] she set out to go with lot and to follow
[1:00:29] her husband and her children and their
[1:00:31] loved ones but it wasn't in her heart
[1:00:34] she still loved the world and so it's
[1:00:37] possible that you can make a start and
[1:00:39] be in the world and the world be in you
[1:00:41] you see she never overcame and
[1:00:44] though she was well on the road and it
[1:00:46] and it finally over throat her she had
[1:00:49] to take that one big long last look
[1:00:52] that's where she got caught
[1:00:54] don't even look back don't have no
[1:00:56] desires you keep going and put your mind
[1:00:59] on Calvary and keep moving towards
[1:01:01] Christ she started out and overcome her
[1:01:05] but she never did overcome though she
[1:01:09] left the denomination she did she walked
[1:01:11] out of Sodom with lot but she wanted to
[1:01:13] go back and have her hair cut you know
[1:01:16] see she had to go back she couldn't
[1:01:18] stand the test she she had to look back
[1:01:20] again to see what the rest of them was
[1:01:22] doing you see she still had something
[1:01:25] that was hanging on to her who you see
[1:01:30] where her heart was her heart was not
[1:01:32] leaving Sodom her heart was back there
[1:01:36] in Sodom are you with me you can walk
[1:01:39] out a Laodicea but if Laodicea is still
[1:01:42] in your heart
[1:01:43] lay out a seal will produce out of your
[1:01:46] own life well you know I have some good
[1:01:50] friends down there after all and after
[1:01:52] all this might be just a little move I
[1:01:54] don't know whether it could be right or
[1:01:55] not I've I've only got this man's word
[1:01:58] for it though he's my husband yet your
[1:02:01] pastor is your husband speaking
[1:02:03] spiritually now whether it could be
[1:02:05] right or not I don't know maybe his
[1:02:07] revelation wasn't right then if you're
[1:02:10] not perfectly satisfied you're not
[1:02:12] perfectly know that it's the Word of God
[1:02:14] then you can't go you've got to be
[1:02:18] really sold out you got to know it you
[1:02:25] see all all of this all of this that we
[1:02:28] we've been bringing to you that you have
[1:02:31] heard throughout the years that if if
[1:02:33] that all that it is it's just an
[1:02:36] intellectual conception and if all this
[1:02:39] message is if this message don't get you
[1:02:42] to Christ are you ask me if this message
[1:02:45] don't get you to Christ you have missed
[1:02:47] it now watch what Jesus said in Matthew
[1:02:51] 22 and 36 master
[1:02:53] which is the Great Commandment in the
[1:02:56] law and Jesus said unto Him thou shalt
[1:03:00] love the Lord thy God with all that
[1:03:03] heart and with all thy soul and with all
[1:03:06] the mind this is the first and Great
[1:03:11] Commandment you see a man who loves God
[1:03:14] with all of his heart is willing to give
[1:03:17] up all he's willing to surrender all and
[1:03:20] he loves nothing as as comparison with
[1:03:24] our Lord Jesus Christ a man that loves
[1:03:26] God is ready to die a man that loves God
[1:03:29] is ready to give up a man that loves God
[1:03:32] is willing to do or to suffer anything
[1:03:34] in order to please and to glorify the
[1:03:38] God of heaven that's a man that loves
[1:03:42] him from his heart now notice in March 7
[1:03:47] and 20 he said that that which cometh
[1:03:50] out of the man that defileth a man for
[1:03:54] from within out of the heart of men
[1:03:57] proceed evil thoughts and adulteries
[1:04:00] fornications and murderers and thefts
[1:04:03] and covetous and wickedness and deceit
[1:04:05] lasciviousness an evil na blasphemy and
[1:04:08] pride and foolishness and all of these
[1:04:11] evil things come from within and defile
[1:04:15] the man so it's not what inner in show
[1:04:20] belly but what comes out of your heart
[1:04:22] are you with me you see it's the unclean
[1:04:26] things that are in your heart are the
[1:04:28] unclean things that come out of your
[1:04:30] mouth you see if you got an unclean
[1:04:33] heart you got a filthy spirit and if you
[1:04:35] got a filthy spirit that filthy spirit
[1:04:38] will lead you to do dirty things and
[1:04:40] we'll take you on the dirty websites and
[1:04:43] we'll take you down roads that you
[1:04:45] shouldn't be going down if you do not
[1:04:48] have a change of the heart
[1:04:51] [Applause]
[1:04:58] notice in the word became flesh let your
[1:05:00] thoughts run pure and your expressions
[1:05:02] for live pure and be pure now out of
[1:05:06] your heart proceeding evil thinking
[1:05:07] adultery and all of these different
[1:05:09] things if that comes out of your heart
[1:05:12] that's what's in your heart are we on
[1:05:15] the same page alright but if out of your
[1:05:19] heart comes righteousness comes peace
[1:05:23] and love and joy oh my then it's coming
[1:05:26] from a resource here that's made up out
[1:05:29] of that see it's made up out of the
[1:05:31] Spirit of God here and Express through
[1:05:34] the words what you say then will come to
[1:05:37] pass you watch a man and a daughter of
[1:05:40] God when they're full of joy full of the
[1:05:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost they can only
[1:05:45] produce what God produces the world does
[1:05:50] not want this acts 2:38 church but it's
[1:05:54] the only kind that two-wire can bring
[1:05:56] forth they don't want a people of change
[1:06:00] heart they want to change their heart
[1:06:02] with ideas and theologies but this word
[1:06:06] will change your thoughts Deuteronomy 6
[1:06:14] and 4 here o Israel the Lord our God is
[1:06:18] one and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[1:06:23] who with half of our heart and with half
[1:06:28] of our soul and with half of our might
[1:06:32] well I must be reading out of the
[1:06:36] domination of book today and thou shalt
[1:06:41] love the Lord thy God with all that's
[1:06:47] the way I read it with all that heart
[1:06:50] and with all the soul and with all the
[1:06:54] might and these words which I command
[1:06:57] thee this day shall be in thine heart
[1:07:04] notice the power of these were
[1:07:07] that if you obey what the word says
[1:07:10] these words shall be in your heart now
[1:07:15] it makes complete sense what Jesus said
[1:07:17] take no thought for tomorrow take no
[1:07:21] thought for what you say for when the
[1:07:23] hour comes my father will give it to you
[1:07:27] so if you have the heart right you have
[1:07:30] your mouth right you look at Samson you
[1:07:38] look at men of old and you see them that
[1:07:40] God always had he had an awful time just
[1:07:44] to get somebody in his control that he
[1:07:47] could yield and that he could use you
[1:07:49] see Samson he was a ladies man Samson
[1:07:53] could roll up him roll up in sleeves and
[1:07:56] show off him biceps and he said take a
[1:07:58] look right there now it wasn't me but
[1:08:01] Samson could roll up my sleeves and he
[1:08:04] could show off he could show off those
[1:08:07] muscles he was a ladies man but that is
[1:08:12] all that God could use of Samson because
[1:08:16] that's all that Samson would give to God
[1:08:20] you see you see God could use his
[1:08:24] strength to go and take the gates and he
[1:08:27] can take him out and go so many hundred
[1:08:30] miles so many miles of that because
[1:08:32] Sampson gave him his strength you see he
[1:08:36] could kill a thousand four listings
[1:08:37] because Samson gave him his strength he
[1:08:40] could tie up hundreds of foxes and like
[1:08:43] their tails on fire and run him through
[1:08:45] their play through the through their
[1:08:47] crops because he gave God his strength
[1:08:50] he can do incredible things because he
[1:08:53] gave God his Swift but when he came to
[1:08:56] his heart he gave his heart to Delilah
[1:09:02] you see and what you give him is what he
[1:09:07] will use you see some people that's
[1:09:09] always jealous they're always jealous is
[1:09:12] somebody that's can sing they're always
[1:09:14] jealous is somebody that can actually
[1:09:15] clap their hands on time they're
[1:09:17] actually jealous of somebody they're
[1:09:19] going
[1:09:19] so we preach I said actually preach you
[1:09:22] see what it is those people that are
[1:09:25] using that talent and using that ability
[1:09:28] they realize that they didn't have no
[1:09:30] ability in them at all but what they did
[1:09:33] is they harness themselves through the
[1:09:37] Word of God and they say God I don't
[1:09:40] have no abilities but what I have I give
[1:09:43] unto you hallelujah
[1:09:47] if you give God your energies he'll use
[1:09:49] your energies if you give God your mind
[1:09:52] he'll use your mind if you give God your
[1:09:54] soul he'll take some clean control of
[1:09:57] that soul if you give God your strength
[1:10:00] who use Australia if you give God if you
[1:10:03] give God your all he'll use your all
[1:10:06] where people are so bound up is they
[1:10:10] love controlling their heart you hear
[1:10:17] the Prophet he would speak door to the
[1:10:18] heart and keys through the heart and
[1:10:20] breeze through the heart and keys to the
[1:10:22] door you see his he's bringing forth in
[1:10:26] such a simple way you go back and listen
[1:10:28] to believe from the heart it's such a
[1:10:30] powerful message but it's that simple so
[1:10:35] many times people get themselves worked
[1:10:38] up and think I've got to do this or I
[1:10:40] got to do that it's something that just
[1:10:43] comes out of the heart I was sure glad
[1:10:50] when I found out then I didn't have to
[1:10:52] do this work I was sure glad when I
[1:10:55] found out that I didn't have to go out
[1:10:57] there and convert my friends but he
[1:10:59] would be my stay that he would be my
[1:11:02] strength that he would be my seal that
[1:11:05] he would be my book hallelujah yes he
[1:11:10] put a desire in my heart to see a world
[1:11:12] to see a world realize the power of this
[1:11:16] message but he's the one that doeth the
[1:11:20] work
[1:11:23] you see he could give Delilah his heart
[1:11:27] they couldn't give that to God and it's
[1:11:31] the same way today when men do not want
[1:11:34] to receive the reality of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:38] Christ it shows that there's a headship
[1:11:42] issue it shows that there's some major
[1:11:46] is she's gone on the inside when they do
[1:11:48] not want to be yes they want to be saved
[1:11:51] they don't want to go to a devil's hell
[1:11:53] but they have an headship issue when
[1:11:56] they will not make Christ the Lord of
[1:11:59] all you've had people to stand behind
[1:12:01] this pulpit and get up and pray through
[1:12:04] pray prayers are 30 to 40 minutes long
[1:12:07] and you can tell right there if you
[1:12:08] listen to the message
[1:12:10] that brother Branham said that anybody
[1:12:11] gets up there and does that shows that
[1:12:13] they ain't got a converted heart you had
[1:12:16] people stand up here and pray prayers
[1:12:18] but they could not live right yet people
[1:12:21] stand behind this pulpit and man could
[1:12:23] they sing the jailhouse nail but they
[1:12:25] couldn't keep the pants up it showed
[1:12:27] that there was a problem on the inside
[1:12:30] of their heart
[1:12:32] you got preachers that can't preach this
[1:12:35] message because they have a high problem
[1:12:45] proverbs 4:23 keep by heart with all
[1:12:49] diligence for out of it are the issues
[1:12:53] of life the heart young girls young boys
[1:13:01] people of all ages should be carefully
[1:13:04] guarded because out of your heart comes
[1:13:08] all the actions of life your heart is a
[1:13:16] very powerful thing now notice verse
[1:13:18] Samuel 16 and 7 but the Lord said unto
[1:13:21] Samuel look not on his countenance or on
[1:13:24] the height of his stature because I have
[1:13:27] refused him
[1:13:29] now remember well the angel said look
[1:13:33] past what you see for the Lord seeth not
[1:13:37] as man saith for man looketh on the
[1:13:40] outward appearance but the Lord looks on
[1:13:45] the heart I think there's a key to this
[1:13:52] Psalms 44 and 21 shall not God search
[1:13:57] this out for he knoweth the secrets of
[1:14:01] the heart now is that not what we have
[1:14:05] been told that the Word of God is sharp
[1:14:08] it's a - it's hard it's cutting going
[1:14:12] and coming and it is a discerner of the
[1:14:15] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:14:18] so we see that this quick and alive word
[1:14:21] is cutting to the heart of things it
[1:14:26] knows every little intricate and motive
[1:14:29] of your heart you see in the heart we
[1:14:34] find the true man on the outside the
[1:14:37] outer life is but clothing and maybe a
[1:14:39] mask of Christianity but from the heart
[1:14:41] Springs all of the actions of life you
[1:14:45] see the inward parts every room and
[1:14:48] every corner of it he knows the secrets
[1:14:51] of your heart he knows your thoughts he
[1:14:54] knows her intense he knows her purposes
[1:14:56] and designs and imaginations all the
[1:14:59] secret motions of it and he even knows
[1:15:01] the wickedness of your heart Jeremiah 17
[1:15:09] and 9 the heart is deceitful above all
[1:15:12] things and desperately wicked and who
[1:15:16] can know it
[1:15:18] take that study that eat them the heart
[1:15:22] is deceitful above all things where you
[1:15:26] say no way not my heart are you kidding
[1:15:30] me watch your heart you watch your heart
[1:15:34] as a young person and your heart would
[1:15:36] deceive you and your heart would tell
[1:15:39] you that you love
[1:15:40] that man he's so handsome heroes those
[1:15:45] soldiers back
[1:15:46] but that man ain't got an ounce of man
[1:15:49] in him your heart can be deceived your
[1:15:55] heart can get so entangled up with the
[1:15:57] things of the world and make you fall in
[1:15:59] love with the world and it proves to me
[1:16:02] that you don't have the love of God but
[1:16:06] notice what verse 10 says that I the
[1:16:08] LORD search the heart I try the reins
[1:16:13] even to give every man according to his
[1:16:15] ways according to the fruit of his doing
[1:16:18] so we watch and we see that verse 10 is
[1:16:22] the answer to verse 9 it's the answer to
[1:16:27] it the heart is deceitful but he cannot
[1:16:29] deceive him are you with me you can
[1:16:33] deceive yourself you can deceive your
[1:16:35] momma you can deceive your best friends
[1:16:37] you can deceive your doctors you can
[1:16:39] deceive your lawyers you can deceive the
[1:16:42] banker and tell him you got this much
[1:16:43] money but he knows but God cannot be
[1:16:47] deceived you can deceive your girlfriend
[1:16:51] you can deceive your boyfriend but God
[1:16:54] cannot be deceived for He is Jehovah and
[1:16:58] he sees the very secrets of the heart
[1:17:02] the Apostles would call him and acts 1
[1:17:06] and 24 the knower of the heart he sees
[1:17:12] past you he sees past your camouflage
[1:17:17] and he breaks down all of the barriers
[1:17:19] of who you think you are and what you're
[1:17:22] trying to make yourself up into he sees
[1:17:27] past that mask
[1:17:35] hey man you remember what you remember
[1:17:40] when they had that breakfast you'll hear
[1:17:41] brother BAM talk about it quite often up
[1:17:44] rare in Kentucky in there Billy Graham
[1:17:46] was a speaker of that of that breakfast
[1:17:48] and he got up layer he got up there and
[1:17:51] he blamed he said he said it reason why
[1:17:53] he said I can go into a city and I can
[1:17:56] have over three months I believe he said
[1:17:58] I can have 16,000 converts but come back
[1:18:01] in a year and only have 16 he said the
[1:18:04] reason of it is is you lazy preachers
[1:18:07] brother BAM said he said now I
[1:18:09] understand I'll go with you a little bit
[1:18:10] on that Billy he said but decisions he
[1:18:14] said you can make a million decisions
[1:18:16] you can make all kinds of confessions
[1:18:19] and that confession is a decision stone
[1:18:22] you can have all kinds of decision but
[1:18:24] as long as they're seen out there and
[1:18:26] malice and they and the glamour of sin
[1:18:29] out there it will still grab people if
[1:18:32] they do not have a change in the hundred
[1:18:39] you can come to this church all your
[1:18:41] life you can change your clothes you can
[1:18:45] change your clothes and look right right
[1:18:47] in front of me or look right in front of
[1:18:49] Brother on you can change your clothes
[1:18:51] you can even change your hair you can
[1:18:53] change your speech you can change the
[1:18:55] way you talk change the way you walk but
[1:18:58] if you do not have a change of the heart
[1:19:01] you'll fall right back in the same
[1:19:03] things you can fall who you you can
[1:19:05] change who you sleep with you can change
[1:19:07] who you fall in love with you can change
[1:19:09] all types of things change your job you
[1:19:11] can change how you do business but if
[1:19:14] you don't have a change of the heart you
[1:19:17] gonna fall right back in you're gonna be
[1:19:19] on the treadmill go up and down a roller
[1:19:21] coaster and you're gonna figure out one
[1:19:22] day you gonna have your head over top of
[1:19:25] the side of that thing throwing up
[1:19:26] because you've been every which way but
[1:19:28] right because the Bible says that as a
[1:19:36] man thinketh in his heart
[1:19:41] and you will allow the enemy to beat you
[1:19:44] down and rob you and make you think
[1:19:46] you're not good enough but as you think
[1:19:49] in your heart so are you the reason why
[1:19:52] I know I'm a winner
[1:19:54] because I think I'm a winner the reason
[1:19:57] I know I'm proud is because I think like
[1:19:59] Brian you cannot think like a loser and
[1:20:05] be a winner good job
[1:20:24] swallow it it'll help you it'll help you
[1:20:31] when Jesus crossed over the ocean and
[1:20:39] the enemy tried his best to get G keep
[1:20:43] Jesus for going all the way over and he
[1:20:47] clouds storms are raised up but when you
[1:20:50] find Jesus over in mark chapter 5 and
[1:20:53] you see him there and he calls this man
[1:20:57] leech who hid those to him and you know
[1:21:02] the story but he does not go to him he
[1:21:06] did not change his dwelling place first
[1:21:09] he changed his heart he changed his
[1:21:13] thinking he changed his mind and then he
[1:21:17] changed his clothes he didn't change all
[1:21:21] of them before he didn't change where he
[1:21:23] lived their change how he dressed he
[1:21:25] changed his heart and when he changed
[1:21:28] his heart then he was found sitting at
[1:21:30] the feet of Jesus in his right mind with
[1:21:33] his right clothes on that's the reason
[1:21:36] why people are still sitting out there
[1:21:38] half-naked it's because they never got
[1:21:41] to Jesus
[1:21:46] [Applause]
[1:21:48] to me this is simple it's real simple if
[1:21:52] my car is broke down outside and I know
[1:21:55] that the engine is blown up and every
[1:21:58] little thing of that engine is
[1:22:00] completely tore up it's messed up the
[1:22:02] heads is messed up everything about the
[1:22:05] engines messed up what good is it going
[1:22:07] to do me to go out there and change the
[1:22:09] oil on it it won't do me one liquor good
[1:22:13] it will prove to you that I'm an idiot
[1:22:15] if I do that I need to change the engine
[1:22:19] and when I change the engine then I can
[1:22:24] get back on the road oh you may have got
[1:22:27] off the Kings Highway but just change
[1:22:29] your heart and step right back on in I
[1:22:34] [Applause]
[1:22:44] know we come to baptism but let me drop
[1:22:47] this he said now being baptized in Jesus
[1:22:50] name or in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:52] Christ rather that's that's alright but
[1:22:56] that's not all of it
[1:22:58] you could be baptized 50 times like that
[1:23:01] and don't do a bit of good until the
[1:23:03] hearts changed we're guilty we're guilty
[1:23:09] up here we're baptizing drown sinners
[1:23:16] and they come back up wet sinners but I
[1:23:20] can't change them what good would it do
[1:23:25] me if I tried to change them
[1:23:27] is that right all they are is attaching
[1:23:30] themselves to me or to what I've said
[1:23:34] but if they don't have a change in the
[1:23:37] heart that can baptize them frontwards
[1:23:39] backwards flip them upside down baptize
[1:23:42] them every single time in the name of
[1:23:45] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:46] but until they get a change in the heart
[1:23:48] that water won't do them one bit of good
[1:23:52] it is a sign of what is taking place you
[1:24:02] find people they keep falling in the
[1:24:06] same rut they keep going through the
[1:24:09] same process of things they keep getting
[1:24:13] beat down they can't ever find victory
[1:24:16] or and they keep going back to the same
[1:24:17] ruts or they or because of tradition
[1:24:20] they do the same things probably one of
[1:24:26] the nicest compliments that you people
[1:24:28] hear the gospel lighthouses as paid to
[1:24:30] me is I've got a lot of people here that
[1:24:33] tell me that I that I act like Homer
[1:24:38] there's a lot of people that tell me
[1:24:40] that I act like my daddy right now
[1:24:42] that's a great complement and I received
[1:24:45] that as a great compliment but let me
[1:24:46] show you how I receive that I never
[1:24:51] watch my granddaddy in his heyday so I
[1:24:55] don't get up here trying to act like
[1:24:57] Homer Frasier I don't get up here and
[1:25:00] try to preach like Homer Frasier but
[1:25:02] because there are certain
[1:25:03] characteristics that we are identified
[1:25:05] through certain traits and they're
[1:25:07] passed down through the genealogies of
[1:25:09] time I and you see certain things like
[1:25:12] Homer Fraser now that's a great
[1:25:15] compliment but understand me right here
[1:25:18] but I don't want to be Homer Frasier
[1:25:22] understand me I know that it might hurt
[1:25:24] some of your feelings but understand
[1:25:26] what I'm saying I don't want to be Homer
[1:25:28] Fraser and neither do I want to be
[1:25:30] Ronald Spencer now I would like to be
[1:25:32] able to preach like Ronald Spencer and
[1:25:34] preach like Homer Frasier but I don't
[1:25:36] want to be them because you see there's
[1:25:39] so many people now I'm gonna drop a bomb
[1:25:42] right here there's so many people that
[1:25:44] attach themselves to brother homers
[1:25:46] personality but they never got attached
[1:25:49] to Jesus there's so many people that
[1:25:53] attacks himself to brother on but they
[1:25:55] never attach themselves to Jesus but if
[1:25:58] you can hear what the home
[1:26:01] brother on preach and you can get a
[1:26:03] change in your heart you can attach
[1:26:05] yourself to the Fountain of Life
[1:26:13] we must attach ourselves to Jesus you
[1:26:23] see I could get up here now you all love
[1:26:28] brother Homer who get up here and sing
[1:26:30] about that old dog he can make that
[1:26:34] song live but that ain't my song and you
[1:26:37] all know that
[1:26:38] that ain't brother Matthew songs so what
[1:26:40] good now I'm using this as an
[1:26:42] illustration brother Matthew and I
[1:26:43] myself can handle that what good is it
[1:26:46] going to sing a song that does not
[1:26:49] attach itself I'm using this in a
[1:26:52] parallel what good is he going to do for
[1:26:55] me to sing a song that I cannot relate
[1:26:58] to are you with me what good is he going
[1:27:04] to do for me to attach myself to a dead
[1:27:08] call and did God call Muhammed when I
[1:27:12] can't relate to it but if I can attach
[1:27:16] myself to King Jesus I can relate to
[1:27:20] King Jesus
[1:27:30] we don't wanna become stagnant in our
[1:27:33] devotion we don't want to become
[1:27:35] stagnant in our worship we don't want to
[1:27:37] become stagnant in our praise we don't
[1:27:39] want to become stagnant in our prayers
[1:27:41] we don't want to become stagnant in our
[1:27:43] preach and we must get you to Jesus and
[1:27:46] if all we preach is a God of yesterday
[1:27:49] it will not do you one lick of good but
[1:27:52] if I can lift this God out of history
[1:27:55] he'll change your heart he'll change
[1:27:58] your mind he'll change your walks you
[1:28:01] change your top it's a time that the
[1:28:06] young people of this message start
[1:28:08] lifting this God out of history this God
[1:28:15] is an omnipotent powerful all-knowing
[1:28:20] God that desires to change your heart if
[1:28:32] we've grown stagnant would probably
[1:28:35] drink from a broken sister and it's got
[1:28:38] full of wiggle tails and everything else
[1:28:40] and if your experience has got wiggle
[1:28:43] tails in it if your experience has got
[1:28:47] old dead cold
[1:28:53] Cemetery ideas behind it you need to
[1:28:57] change the water you're drinking that's
[1:29:02] why I have told these musicians that's
[1:29:04] why I have told the song leaders that
[1:29:07] when we get behind here this pulpit we
[1:29:10] don't ever take one service for granted
[1:29:13] you break into around you break into the
[1:29:16] Holies of Holies for one person could
[1:29:19] come into this place and that song
[1:29:21] change their heart too many times we got
[1:29:26] Christians that just walk in and walk
[1:29:28] out and think well this is the way
[1:29:30] things are just going to be and they
[1:29:32] miss
[1:29:36] search this whole search is here for one
[1:29:41] purpose and that's for changed lives and
[1:29:44] when we can't preach say God that saves
[1:29:47] Souls I can't make nobody death here on
[1:29:53] this street bride but if I can lead one
[1:29:55] of them to Jesus Christ it's worth 10
[1:29:59] million worlds I'm personal friends with
[1:30:06] a customer of mine and he's very close
[1:30:08] friends or very attached to certain
[1:30:11] message people that are the most legal
[1:30:14] esteem at in your life and every single
[1:30:19] time he meets them they condemn him but
[1:30:24] they have never pointed him to the god
[1:30:26] of this message if all this is it's just
[1:30:31] books and tapes we're missing it but he
[1:30:37] said these words he said the very first
[1:30:39] time I met you and I met your daddy I
[1:30:42] said I can serve a god like that that's
[1:30:45] the kind of people that we ought to be
[1:30:47] not walking around and condemning people
[1:30:49] for cutting the hair wearing ear bombs
[1:30:52] and all types of things let's get them
[1:30:55] to the God of this message let's get out
[1:31:00] to new Jesus
[1:31:01] let's get grottoes to Jesus it's not my
[1:31:16] duty to put
[1:31:19] it's not my duty but by the preaching of
[1:31:28] this word and by the dress wear of this
[1:31:31] message you'll become dressed but if all
[1:31:36] I can do sister Sarah if all I can do is
[1:31:44] get them to a God that heals maybe they
[1:31:49] can't feed on your level let's get them
[1:31:51] to a god to a God that saves we
[1:31:57] understand that there's three kind of
[1:31:58] believers in every church but let's get
[1:32:00] all those believers
[1:32:02] let's get every single one of them stop
[1:32:05] writing people off and start right
[1:32:07] people in
[1:32:16] our Christian experience should be
[1:32:18] moving higher not to become comfortable
[1:32:20] and not to become satisfied and I'm
[1:32:23] afraid too many times that message
[1:32:25] people get the idea well I'm here
[1:32:27] because I heard that God sent a prophet
[1:32:30] where I heard well how about sitting in
[1:32:32] the ministry of other honor I'm a good
[1:32:34] enough Christian what is it good enough
[1:32:37] Christian I figured that doubt and the
[1:32:39] only thing that I can figure out is when
[1:32:41] I get there that'll be good enough but a
[1:32:43] good enough Christian here is not good
[1:32:45] enough for me it's too long we've been
[1:32:51] sitting here and be getting satisfied
[1:32:53] awful all off of our own ideas or we sit
[1:32:56] here and we just go through the motions
[1:32:59] it's a time that the fire falls again
[1:33:04] and say well you ain't got no need a
[1:33:06] preaching like this really
[1:33:09] it's wonder that he told me to do it but
[1:33:14] too many times we're getting like that
[1:33:16] frog and we get so comfortable and we
[1:33:22] forget to jump out the water you see if
[1:33:26] you throw that for you threw that frog
[1:33:27] and a bowling pot of water he'll jump
[1:33:29] right out but what the trick is is you
[1:33:34] put that frog in that water and you
[1:33:38] slowly turn up the heat that's what sin
[1:33:41] does it slowly turns up the heat well
[1:33:46] what's one cigarette
[1:33:48] what's one time
[1:33:51] what's one second nobody seen we've
[1:33:56] become comfortable
[1:34:04] I find it amazing that when Jesus goes
[1:34:09] over in John chapter five and he goes by
[1:34:13] the Pool of Bethesda as a man that's
[1:34:16] been laying there in that condition for
[1:34:18] 38 years being laying there and the
[1:34:23] Prophet would tell us that this man
[1:34:24] could have lived with that situation for
[1:34:26] the rest of his life but Jesus had a
[1:34:30] reason go back there Jesus seen now
[1:34:34] Jesus had the power to fix every single
[1:34:37] one of their problems but because Jesus
[1:34:39] was led of the Lord he went to that one
[1:34:43] but notice what Jesus says to him will
[1:34:46] thou be made whole you look at that and
[1:34:53] you think anybody in a sickness would
[1:34:55] say you looking for the wrong man would
[1:34:57] you be hope it's an easy it's an easy
[1:35:03] answer
[1:35:04] anybody that sick rap racing in and you
[1:35:07] can have some class for this day when
[1:35:08] you're sick do you want to get well one
[1:35:14] more time when you're sick do you want
[1:35:16] to get well all right that's pretty
[1:35:18] pretty clear to me but Jesus goes by his
[1:35:21] way and he speaks to him and he says
[1:35:25] will thou be made whole what is he
[1:35:28] saying to him this man's laid that are
[1:35:30] in that condition and he's got
[1:35:31] accustomed to living right there and
[1:35:33] stand right there and so many times
[1:35:35] Jesus comes by here and he says will
[1:35:39] thou be made whole what is he asking him
[1:35:43] are you willing to be changed are you
[1:35:48] tired of living in that condition are
[1:35:50] you tired of saying in that sin I get
[1:35:53] tired of falling in the same loop are
[1:35:55] you tired of sickness I get tired of
[1:35:57] death are you tired of the enemy won't
[1:36:03] you be changed
[1:36:13] we could bring a hog right up here prize

[1:36:22] prize hog up here you can clean that

[1:38:34] so look at your neighbors say it's
[1:38:36] alright take a bath honey I'm doing a
[1:38:42] little bit of past work all over this
[1:38:43] place tonight
[1:38:44] some of y'all gonna thank me tonight
[1:38:53] hallelujah
[1:39:03] who knew brother Jonas be it much fun
[1:39:07] the word heart can be found in the Bible
[1:39:12] 765 times so God wants your heart he's
[1:39:21] not after your wallet and this
[1:39:24] pre-trained after your wallet he's not
[1:39:27] after all your rose roses I don't think
[1:39:30] anybody's got one here but he and after
[1:39:32] he's not after all your houses and all
[1:39:35] your monies and all the things you own
[1:39:37] he's only after your heart and the very
[1:39:43] first time the word heart is found in
[1:39:45] the Bible is over in the book of Genesis
[1:39:48] when it tells us that God repents that
[1:39:52] he made man that the heart of man was
[1:39:56] growing and going after after the sons
[1:39:59] of men and after chasing after the sin
[1:40:02] of man but there was a man on earth that
[1:40:07] had found grace in the sight of the Lord
[1:40:09] Jesus he'd found grace in his sight that
[1:40:13] man didn't know nothing about building
[1:40:15] nothing he was a simple farmer but God
[1:40:20] come to Noah and he asked him to do the
[1:40:26] impossible when everybody else were
[1:40:29] around him would criticize him but
[1:40:31] because that his heart was pliable he
[1:40:34] could do what the word said and when
[1:40:37] there was a man on the earth that said
[1:40:39] I'll do what you said that he goes out
[1:40:42] there and he starts building an ark in
[1:40:45] front of all of his family and in front
[1:40:48] of all of his people and this appears
[1:40:50] and he goes out and he would grab a hold
[1:40:54] of a wood brother and brother Terry some
[1:40:56] of your brothers had no wooden things he
[1:40:58] would grab a hold of the wood that you
[1:41:00] would never build an ark out of
[1:41:03] but God commanded him to take of a
[1:41:06] gopher wood now that gopher wood is
[1:41:09] built in such a way it's got holes all
[1:41:11] in it it's porous it's got holes all in
[1:41:14] it everywhere
[1:41:15] nobody in their right mind would chose
[1:41:16] it but here was God constructed and he
[1:41:21] what he did he could all of us all those
[1:41:23] beings down and then he would take back
[1:41:26] to other trees like pine trees and
[1:41:28] sapling trees and he would go and beat
[1:41:30] the rasam out of that old pine tree and
[1:41:33] he would the Bible said to pitch it with
[1:41:36] tar what was he doing he was pouring
[1:41:41] that tar that rosin overtop of all of
[1:41:44] those porous holes and it was pliable it
[1:41:47] was light it was easy to work with and
[1:41:49] when he poured that rosin overtop of
[1:41:52] that wood it made it hard as steel and
[1:41:55] it would ride right over the judgment of
[1:41:59] God you see what men called crazy God
[1:42:04] called great you see him look crazy to
[1:42:08] the eyes of the world but Noah just took
[1:42:11] his hammer and he went out there and he
[1:42:13] started building what God said Noah
[1:42:16] didn't know how to make it float but God
[1:42:18] did David didn't know how to throw that
[1:42:21] stone but God did hallelujah you see it
[1:42:30] was that Ark that was pliable that had
[1:42:38] poured the rosin in I was able to float
[1:42:41] over the judgments of God you see that
[1:42:43] word pitch means to atone it means to
[1:42:48] atone the church there's an atonement
[1:42:52] that standing between you and the
[1:42:55] judgments of God there's a blood that's
[1:43:01] a blood that says hey you're not guilty
[1:43:05] there's a blood that says that you're
[1:43:08] justified that's a blood that's has next
[1:43:11] you're good enough that's a blood that
[1:43:13] says you're qualified there's a blood
[1:43:15] that says you're elect there's a blood
[1:43:18] that says that you are deigned that's a
[1:43:20] blood that says you're gonna make when
[1:43:22] hail says that it's going to crush you
[1:43:25] there's an atonement there that'll Roger
[1:43:28] and over the judgments of God oh there
[1:43:33] is a blood so many times I'm closing we
[1:43:42] choose different things we choose
[1:43:45] different type of woods but it's got to
[1:43:47] be a pliable heart it's so many times we
[1:43:52] get set in our ways that this is a way
[1:43:56] that I'm going to do it God can't use
[1:44:03] God can't use something you're not
[1:44:07] willing to give him what does he want
[1:44:14] tonight he wants to heart you see once
[1:44:21] it changes your heart I felt like quite
[1:44:27] a dummy while I was standing here
[1:44:31] preaching last weekend why didn't I
[1:44:36] preach that first God said this is the
[1:44:43] way I've ordered it this is the way I've
[1:44:48] ordered it you see you can speak all
[1:44:52] those things and you could say all the
[1:44:54] right things but until you get a changed
[1:44:56] heart
[1:44:58] some of you I and some of you probably
[1:45:01] been sitting here some 40 years there's
[1:45:07] people that have come and gone but the
[1:45:10] reason you're still here is because the
[1:45:13] power of a changed heart you see he
[1:45:19] ordered these things in such a way that
[1:45:21] you can say from this side of it from
[1:45:25] this heart of it I believe from my heart
[1:45:29] mountain be moved from a changed heart
[1:45:35] you can say what the word says
[1:45:38] change heart you can speak the
[1:45:41] impossibilities and watch them become
[1:45:43] possible the music will change fancy
[1:45:58] words won't change you and I even dare
[1:46:02] to say you coming to this altar won't
[1:46:04] change you I even dare to say getting in
[1:46:12] that water won't change you but Jesus
[1:46:17] pointed us to one scripture except a man
[1:46:23] be born again he cannot understand the
[1:46:28] kingdom of God what is it you must have
[1:46:34] a heart change we all want to chose he
[1:46:39] saw but God chose Jacob because of his
[1:46:46] heart stand with me
[1:47:01] I read a story sometime ago about men
[1:47:09] that had seen all of the Mustangs that
[1:47:11] were running wild out of the National
[1:47:15] the National lands of the United States
[1:47:17] and I thought it was such a shame that
[1:47:21] those horses couldn't be used that they
[1:47:22] were just dying off but these four men
[1:47:25] looked at these Mustangs that said they
[1:47:26] can be used as pack horses everybody
[1:47:30] doubted them and everybody disbelieved
[1:47:32] that they could do it but they spent so
[1:47:34] many hours training and working on those
[1:47:36] mistakes that they took a trip from
[1:47:39] Mexico to Canada and they went all the
[1:47:42] way because they learned how to tame
[1:47:48] that Mustang I'd say some of you were
[1:47:54] some real Mustangs in your life and you
[1:47:58] was sure buck some people off but when
[1:48:03] God got ahold of you
[1:48:05] you remember that little story I brother
[1:48:08] Bisco tell about that but that horse
[1:48:11] that was wild looked like he was about
[1:48:13] to kill bud he'd ran her up and he hit
[1:48:16] bud right in the chest
[1:48:19] knock him down brother bisque was said
[1:48:23] brother banner he's a wild one he's
[1:48:29] going to kill bud and he said all of a
[1:48:33] sudden he said I watched that horse is
[1:48:36] it tamed and controlled itself right
[1:48:38] down and it begins to tremble and shake
[1:48:40] on over he said I about to turn back to
[1:48:44] brother Brian him and look and he said
[1:48:45] brother Brandon was putting his hat back
[1:48:47] on his head he said even I realized that
[1:48:51] nature had to recognize the presence of
[1:48:55] that angel what about it if a dumb horse
[1:49:01] don't crucify me for saying that but a
[1:49:04] brute beast if they could have that kind
[1:49:08] of control under the presence of an
[1:49:10] angel what about men and women of God
[1:49:14] how much more should we be under control
[1:49:18] of the angel of the Lord let's sing a
[1:49:22] song I'm amazed that you love me as
[1:49:24] brother oncome system
[1:49:34] [Music]
[1:49:40] [Applause]
[1:49:43] [Music]
[1:49:48] my life was fine without
[1:49:54] I was covering up the secrecy
[1:50:05] then one day someone told me of your
[1:50:11] mercy and the love you show there
[1:50:28] and purchased my retention
[1:50:35] when you broke since power instead my
[1:50:41] speed
[1:50:45] will I be
[1:50:51] that you love me

[1:51:07] you're precious I felt my gosh
[1:51:22] [Applause]

[1:51:31] [Music]
[1:51:38] god bless you
[1:51:40] a man we wouldn't be here without a
[1:51:44] changed heart would we a man for those
[1:51:48] of us that has been in that moment to
[1:51:50] where that we met him it was in that
[1:51:55] moment it was just over is your Amen
[1:52:00] still working well that wonderful
[1:52:04] we're not wonderful you can be seated
[1:52:07] just a moment I want to just say a
[1:52:08] couple of things here and I'd like to
[1:52:15] invite some grandmas and grandad to the
[1:52:18] balcony of Evan if they could look over
[1:52:21] just for a moment tonight is a very
[1:52:29] special night for our family our home
[1:52:33] there's been quite a few special things
[1:52:37] that have been happening of late and
[1:52:39] we're just real thankful for it and
[1:52:45] we're we're very much pleased this
[1:52:49] evening to be a part of brother
[1:52:52] Gabriel's experience with the Lord now
[1:52:57] brother Gabriel has been raised in an
[1:52:59] incredible home preacher's home grandson
[1:53:02] of a minister my nephew and lineages go
[1:53:07] a long way
[1:53:08] Gabriel has been a blessed young man
[1:53:11] he's went away to school he's been a
[1:53:13] star athlete he's won a lot of accolades
[1:53:19] in life today he's a state trooper and
[1:53:23] he actually right there in brother
[1:53:25] Denny's area felt led of the Lord to
[1:53:31] move toward our way and and he just
[1:53:35] wanted to be a part of our congregation
[1:53:37] here
[1:53:48] but it lacks something
[1:53:52] you know you can look the part but you
[1:53:59] like something for a lot of you in this
[1:54:06] building you've been around me in a very
[1:54:10] special moment brother Nathaniel
[1:54:13] standing under a tree a phone call in
[1:54:24] that moment you just knew you and God
[1:54:27] were one-on-one and God was just looking
[1:54:31] right through you Gabriel came to the
[1:54:37] hospital the night that I was preparing
[1:54:40] tomorrow morning to to have brain
[1:54:44] surgery it was just our family there and
[1:54:51] it was a it was just a you never know
[1:54:55] what tomorrow holds with brain surgery
[1:54:58] they were to remove one of three tumors
[1:55:01] and that one was bleeding like sister
[1:55:05] Pruitt's and we're believing for a
[1:55:08] miracle for her tonight
[1:55:10] that one was seeping it was about the
[1:55:14] size of a lemon and it was seeping
[1:55:17] cancerous fluids out of it into the
[1:55:20] cavity of my brain and I'd been given
[1:55:25] some pretty incredible conversations by
[1:55:28] doctors but to prepare us for it but
[1:55:33] nothing can prepare you only Jesus can
[1:55:37] help you and so and so brother Gabriel
[1:55:43] was there and I could detect that
[1:55:46] tonight was a special night
[1:55:51] you know but the room was full you know
[1:55:58] your family's flowing in and out your
[1:56:00] room was just completely full and it was
[1:56:06] before Corbett Kovac it was completely
[1:56:15] full and so there was no space and I
[1:56:18] just kept watching and I was watching
[1:56:21] him and after a bit and I don't know
[1:56:29] only supernatural brother Bernie the
[1:56:32] room emptied and he and I was left alone
[1:56:36] and we would have about 15 minutes alone
[1:56:42] and God did a work
[1:56:47] God just did a work and in about 15
[1:56:52] minutes brother Joshua God came on the
[1:56:56] scene and all of the stuff that was
[1:57:00] fluff in his life meant absolutely zero
[1:57:07] are you with me you could have the whole
[1:57:11] world and Miss Jesus Christ the sermon
[1:57:19] tonight was incredible important they
[1:57:25] remember just before my mother's death
[1:57:31] it was a Wednesday night and he was
[1:57:33] sitting in church and there was a
[1:57:37] preacher came and that preacher toward
[1:57:42] that young man apart with legalism and
[1:57:47] all different kinds of things and medium
[1:57:50] and medium and beat him and beat him and
[1:57:53] my mother got so upset all day the next
[1:58:02] day I talked to my mom trying to settle
[1:58:04] her down there's something that runs in
[1:58:08] that Spencer blood it's just you see
[1:58:16] legalism will not change your life
[1:58:24] it will beat you into an order of a
[1:58:28] prison and you'll never live light under
[1:58:33] legalism it only becomes a prison house
[1:58:43] among passed away with a broken heart I
[1:58:49] talked to her my to my mom and just only
[1:58:55] just hours before her death
[1:58:57] and I said mom remember there's a lot of
[1:59:02] people that love to clean fish before
[1:59:06] they ever catch up they like to clean
[1:59:13] them before they catch up and they're
[1:59:16] really good kitchen help but they ain't
[1:59:22] God called preachers I'm a preach to you
[1:59:27] for five minutes you're gonna be all
[1:59:29] right you're gonna live through
[1:59:32] [Music]
[1:59:38] they can tell you all about how you are
[1:59:42] address and how you are act and how you
[1:59:45] ought to live but they can't bring the
[1:59:49] presence of God on the scene to change
[1:59:53] your heart and a lot of people can only
[2:00:00] flourish under a prison mentality or
[2:00:04] slave mentality but that ain't here
[2:00:10] this is not a Reformation Center this
[2:00:14] ain't a place where you rehab this is a
[2:00:17] place to where God transforms your life
[2:00:21] and he lives on the inside of you I
[2:00:35] remember my mom's promise as a lady in
[2:00:42] the bed and I begin to deal one-on-one
[2:00:47] and Jesus came into the room
[2:00:52] and Gabriel gave his heart to the Lord I
[2:01:01] invited him to come to live with me now
[2:01:06] let me just take you something you could
[2:01:10] have change if you live with me because
[2:01:14] Jesus lives in that house now I don't
[2:01:20] want you to come live with me
[2:01:23] I'm restricted yet the scripture says
[2:01:34] repent and be baptized every one of you
[2:01:41] take on his name there's a covenant that
[2:01:45] comes with this it says for us to be
[2:01:49] buried with him in baptism
[2:01:54] this message is more than quotes books
[2:01:59] tapes all of that has its absolute
[2:02:05] importance this message is life it's not
[2:02:14] the life of William Branham it's not the
[2:02:17] life of Ron Spencer Homer Fraser Andrew
[2:02:21] Spencer and I just told Andrew I believe
[2:02:23] it's one of the greatest messages I've
[2:02:25] ever heard on the heart I'd like to just
[2:02:31] take a moment if you're sitting here and
[2:02:37] you're still on the fence and you're
[2:02:38] still fighting and struggling with you
[2:02:42] you can get that changed you and Jesus
[2:02:49] can get that changed you can get that
[2:02:54] changed tonight
[2:03:00] Gabriel is to be baptized in the name of
[2:03:05] the Lord Jesus Christ he wanted me to to
[2:03:09] do that for him but because of a lack of
[2:03:11] strength and lack of energy I chose to
[2:03:15] be this part and I don't think it's none
[2:03:18] better than to have his daddy
[2:03:43] many years ago I looked at Gabriel's
[2:03:46] daddy my brother Marc Marc was a
[2:03:51] professional bowler with a note over 200
[2:03:56] average he'd got to the point till he
[2:04:03] was about 230 averaging he was getting
[2:04:07] ready he was going big-time
[2:04:12] and God dealt with me to talk to him
[2:04:18] more than just being my brother but of
[2:04:26] the thousands of people that have
[2:04:27] believed to the Lord when he walked into
[2:04:31] my arms at an altar was one of the
[2:04:35] greatest events forgive me for being
[2:04:42] emotional but just how it is lately but
[2:04:49] tonight to watch him baptized Gabriel
[2:04:52] here I wouldn't have missed this for the
[2:04:57] world
[2:05:02] amens I want to pray with brother
[2:05:04] Gabriel publicly before we go and then
[2:05:10] brother Matthew for sing some songs
[2:05:12] while they prepare amen brother cable if
[2:05:17] you'll come brother Marc you come with
[2:05:20] me and ruin
[2:05:30] don't you let me fall off this thing I'm
[2:05:35] proud of yourself I'm really proud of
[2:05:39] you but you know being a Spencer don't
[2:05:46] give you eternal life but that night in
[2:05:51] the hospital
[2:05:54] did it work we've been a pair of that
[2:06:00] work over the last couple of months this
[2:06:08] is the greater portion even tonight
[2:06:14] now Gabriel they're going to baptize you
[2:06:19] with water but he promised
[2:06:24] I'll give you life up until that point
[2:06:32] it's just vows but life is the breath of
[2:06:39] it it's the change of the heart
[2:06:44] it's where man dies out to himself
[2:06:52] Almighty God at this altar just now more
[2:06:58] than wood and pull pets and altar rails
[2:07:08] but there Anders said it right we
[2:07:11] baptized a lot of dry sinners and they
[2:07:15] raised wet will be guilty of that
