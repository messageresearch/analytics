[22:35] [Music]
[22:39] our heads in our hearts
[22:41] the gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[22:43] we love you so much this morning Father
[22:46] Lord what an opportunity Lord it is to
[22:48] call you father Lord Jesus and
[22:51] Lord if we call you father Lord and that
[22:53] is our approach to you that means we are
[22:55] your children Lord and what an honor and
[22:57] a privilege Lord it is to be Sons and
[22:59] Daughters of the king Lord despite
[23:02] father Lord the world that we live in
[23:04] Lord we think of that story Lord the
[23:06] prophet told Lord of that slave Lord
[23:07] that was Lord that was living in life
[23:10] Lord that things maybe didn't go his way
[23:12] but yet the way he walked
[23:14] the way he held himself other people had
[23:17] to recognize
[23:18] that he was the son of a king though he
[23:20] was so far away from his homeland he
[23:23] still conducted himself as the son of
[23:25] the king
[23:26] and Lord Jesus here we are Lord and
[23:28] Satan's heed and Lord
[23:29] sin all around Insanity abounds hell has
[23:32] come up and incarnated the people
[23:35] but yet there is a light on the earth
[23:37] and in spite of the gross Darkness on
[23:39] the people there is a light that the
[23:41] darker it gets the brighter it shines
[23:44] and your sons and your daughters are
[23:47] made manifest upon the Earth
[23:49] and father God lord we carry ourselves
[23:52] as you told us to conduct ourselves and
[23:54] we conduct ourselves as Sons and
[23:56] Daughters of God what an honor and a
[23:58] privilege Lord it is to reflect your
[24:00] kingdom on the earth and Lord to witness
[24:02] the other people or that there is a way
[24:05] there is a way father Lord out that a
[24:08] life that can live above sin there is an
[24:10] overcoming power not within ourselves
[24:12] but Lord Jesus by the Holy Ghost
[24:15] father that you promise proof of your
[24:17] resurrection that then comes upon the
[24:20] repentant sinner
[24:22] and Lord you allow father Lord you
[24:24] living through a yielded vessel or that
[24:26] you literally overcome through our
[24:29] bodies no matter what the enemy May
[24:31] throw at us no matter what trap Lord the
[24:34] Holy Ghost in US is more than able to
[24:37] overcome anything and everything father
[24:39] as the scripture says that no weapon
[24:42] that is formed against us can prosper
[24:44] they may try and be formed against us
[24:47] they may try and trap us
[24:49] but oh God it won't prosper

[24:53] your kingdom by the Holy Ghost
[24:55] and father God we bring this token life
[24:57] of Jesus Christ with our prayers we've
[25:00] been instructed to do Lord we lift up

[25:09] love us
[25:10] father the entire gospel story the
[25:13] entire Plan of Redemption
[25:15] is based on your love that you refuse to

[47:13] and especially for today I want to speak
[47:15] to you on seeing past the old book
[47:22] I've given God a a million reasons not
[47:26] to love me
[47:29] none of them changed his mind
[47:34] I think that's so profound
[47:37] brother Branham said he said he that
[47:38] cometh unto me I will and know why cast
[47:41] out
[47:42] he said I believe that
[47:44] once coming under the blood and take his
[47:48] word for anything that he says
[47:51] and every believer here it is I want you
[47:54] to get it
[47:55] every man and woman that has once been
[47:58] brought into the blood of Christ
[48:00] all fear
[48:02] and condemnation is gone out
[48:06] then he will believe every word that God
[48:11] writes in the Bible to be the truth
[48:15] he will not say this is not inspired and
[48:17] that's not inspired but he will believe
[48:20] every word of it
[48:23] come to the Fountain fill with blood
[48:26] drawn from Emmanuel's veins
[48:30] oh what a wonderful savior that we have
[48:33] What A Plan of Redemption
[48:36] Jehovah alone allotted for us
[48:40] laid out the carpet for us
[48:43] to come home
[48:45] I love that what a wonderful heavenly
[48:48] father that we have
[48:50] Revelations chapter 19 and verse 6.
[48:54] and I heard as if it were a voice of a
[48:57] great multitude and as a voice of many
[48:59] Waters
[49:00] as a voice of Mighty thundering saying
[49:03] hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent
[49:07] reigneth
[49:08] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[49:11] honor to him for the marriage of the
[49:13] Lamb has come
[49:14] and his wife has made herself ready
[49:18] and to her was granted that she should
[49:20] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[49:24] for the final lineness the righteousness
[49:27] of saints and he saith unto me right
[49:31] blessed are they which are called to the
[49:33] marriage supper of the Lamb
[49:35] and he saith unto me these are the true
[49:39] sayings of God I think that's so
[49:42] incredible Revelations 19 and 11 and I
[49:46] saw I saw heaven opened and a and a
[49:49] white horse and behold a white horse and
[49:51] he that set up upon him was called
[49:54] faithful and true
[49:57] and in righteousness he doth judge and
[50:00] make war his eyes were as a flame of
[50:03] fire in his head were as many crowns and
[50:06] he had a name written that no man knew
[50:10] but he himself
[50:12] and he was clothed with a master dipped
[50:15] in blood
[50:16] and his name is called the word of God
[50:20] and the armies which were in heaven
[50:23] followed him upon white horses clothed
[50:27] in fine linen white and clean and out of
[50:32] his mouth goeth a sharp sword
[50:35] that with it he should Smite the Nations
[50:38] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[50:41] iron and tread upon the wine presses of
[50:44] fierceness and Wrath of almighty God and
[50:47] he hath on his master uh on his a name
[50:52] written king of kings and Lord of the
[50:57] Lords you can be seated today may the
[51:00] Lord add the blessing to the word
[51:04] Revelations chapter 21 I love to read my
[51:07] hand our future
[51:10] and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth
[51:12] for the first Heaven and the first
[51:14] Strokes were passed away
[51:16] and there was no more sea
[51:18] and I John sold the holy city in New
[51:21] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[51:24] heaven
[51:25] prepared as a broad adorned for her
[51:28] husband and I heard a great voice out of
[51:31] Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of
[51:35] God is with men and he will dwell with
[51:37] them and they shall be his people and
[51:39] God shall be with him and be their God
[51:42] that's our future
[51:45] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[51:49] their eyes and there shall be no more
[51:51] death
[51:52] we should we should have a shouting
[51:54] service right now there shall be no more
[51:57] death neither sorrow nor crying neither
[52:00] shall there be any more pain for the
[52:03] former things are passed away
[52:06] I love it and he that sat upon the
[52:09] throne said behold I make all things new
[52:14] and he said unto me right for these
[52:17] words are true and faithful and he said
[52:20] it to me it is done I am Alpha and Omega
[52:26] the beginning and the end and I will
[52:30] give unto him that is a thirst of the
[52:32] Fountain of Water of Life freely
[52:35] and he that overcometh I want to be one
[52:38] of these
[52:39] and he that overcometh shall inherit all
[52:41] things
[52:42] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[52:46] son
[52:47] [Music]
[52:49] Hallelujah
[52:52] Romans chapter 7 and verse 15.
[52:56] for I know that in me
[52:59] that is in my flesh
[53:02] dwelleth no good thing
[53:05] for to me
[53:07] for to will is present with me
[53:11] but how to perform that which is good I
[53:15] find not
[53:16] for that for the good that I would I do
[53:20] not
[53:21] but the evil which I would not
[53:24] that I do what a conflict
[53:27] now if I do that I would not it is no
[53:33] more I do it but sin dwelleth in me I
[53:38] find then a law that when I would do
[53:41] good
[53:42] evil is present with me
[53:45] for I Delight I Delight in the law of
[53:48] God after the inward man
[53:52] but I see another law in my members war
[53:56] and against the law of my mind
[53:59] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[54:02] sin which is in my members
[54:05] notice these next words maybe you could
[54:07] read it with me all wretched man that I
[54:11] am
[54:12] who shall deliver me from this body of
[54:16] this death
[54:17] I thank God through Jesus Christ Our
[54:20] Lord so then with the mind I Des I
[54:24] myself serve the law of God but with the
[54:27] flesh the law of sin I want you to
[54:31] understand our soul is born again
[54:35] our soul is born again but this flesh
[54:38] that is worth about 84 cents in
[54:41] chemicals
[54:43] you can put the best suit on it you can
[54:45] put the best hairstyle on it you can put
[54:48] your best belt your best boots you can
[54:50] put you can put the best dress that you
[54:52] could wear
[54:55] and we pamper it we love it we try to
[54:58] take care of it at least you should
[55:01] you brush its teeth you calm its hair
[55:04] you wash it every day
[55:07] hope you wash it every day
[55:10] but it's still worth about 84 cents
[55:14] it came from the cursed earth when Adam
[55:18] fell
[55:19] the Earth fell with it
[55:21] when God laid out the potassium and the
[55:24] potash God knew where you would be born
[55:26] you were pre-planned
[55:28] this first body this first Union that
[55:31] you would have
[55:33] is your greatest enemy
[55:36] your greatest enemy is not Biden or
[55:38] Trump or
[55:40] the high school principal or your
[55:42] teachers or your husband or your wife
[55:44] nobody go to punching each other right
[55:46] now your greatest enemy is yourself
[55:52] the old man nature that when you're
[55:56] when you said you got to be born again
[55:58] you were born in sin you were shaping an
[56:01] iniquity
[56:03] you're fearfully and wonderfully made
[56:05] God knew how tall you'd be how fluffy
[56:09] you would be he knew how skinny you
[56:11] would be
[56:12] I'm not tall dark and handsome
[56:18] just a few of us understand that but
[56:22] and so and so we we realize that maybe
[56:26] we would like to be like somebody else
[56:28] but God made us exactly how we are
[56:32] he pre-planned us he watched over us
[56:35] knowing that we would come through this
[56:37] old birth or our first husband of our
[56:41] first nature and we would come through
[56:43] that through the bedding grounds of her
[56:45] mother and father and inherit their sins
[56:48] and inherit their DNA sometimes in our
[56:51] DNA it it allows temper to fall down
[56:54] into her lives perfectly good child with
[56:57] a wild temper stubborn Natures lustful
[57:01] passions fall right down the DNA chain
[57:05] and as much as no matter if you're
[57:07] gentle no matter how loving that you are
[57:10] no matter how good a person you are we
[57:12] still got to be born again
[57:15] born again it's not putting your name on
[57:17] a church book or signing or making vows
[57:20] born again is your nature your first
[57:23] Nature has to die
[57:26] you have to die to that original nature
[57:29] and Jesus comes in he gives you a new
[57:32] spirit like Ezekiel said he gives you a
[57:35] new spirit so God can live with you
[57:38] sometimes sometimes not even Jesus can
[57:42] live with certain people so let me just
[57:44] say God gives you a new nature
[57:48] he gives you a new spirit where you can
[57:51] live with yourself
[57:52] listen you can live at peace you don't
[57:54] have to war all the time
[57:58] that old nature leaves you but it will
[58:01] haunt you
[58:03] it used to be the king of your heart it
[58:06] used to rule and reign
[58:12] s there was condemnation you were down
[58:15] the stream with the world you were doing
[58:17] everything that you wanted to do but
[58:20] listen when God comes
[58:22] then a war begins to happen in your body
[58:26] that body that came from a sinful Earth
[58:29] that body that loved the sin the love
[58:32] the lived loved all of the attributes of
[58:35] everything of unbelief now that body has
[58:38] got a new king that's living on the
[58:40] inside let me just say this king's got
[58:42] the power
[58:45] he's got the power to take dominion over
[58:48] your life
[58:50] and let me just save yourself well
[58:52] brother Ron I still I still have a
[58:54] temporary well you need to be born again
[58:56] I still lust I still do all of those
[58:59] different kind of things if that King
[59:01] truly lives in your heart
[59:04] you can have dominion over those things
[59:07] in your life
[59:13] now I want you to just notice Romans
[59:15] chapter 8. sometimes when when the the
[59:18] scriptures are laid out
[59:20] it doesn't mean that the sermon was over
[59:22] with
[59:24] but chapter from chapter seven o
[59:26] Wretched Man that I am that's a man
[59:29] that's in a Justified state
[59:32] he's in a state that is trying to become
[59:35] Sanctified but when you become full of
[59:37] the Holy Ghost
[59:40] chapter 8 and verse 1 there is therefore
[59:43] now no condemnation
[59:45] I'm not that guy that I used to be
[59:49] I'm not married to that original husband
[59:53] now I'm not talking about two or three
[59:55] different wives here and I'm not talking
[59:56] about the woman at the well I'm talking
[59:58] about your old nature
[1:00:01] there is a therefore now no condemnation
[1:00:05] to them that are in Christ Jesus when he
[1:00:08] is your husband when he is your lord
[1:00:11] when he is your king
[1:00:15] there's no more condemnation I want to
[1:00:18] drive this point today there's no more
[1:00:21] condemnation to them who walk not after
[1:00:24] the flesh
[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:29] Hallelujah I'm not going back to that
[1:00:32] cursed Earth condition
[1:00:33] I might be buried in this ground one of
[1:00:36] these days but let me just say this you
[1:00:38] listen don't weep for me I'll be more
[1:00:41] alive then than I ever have been here
[1:00:45] [Applause]
[1:00:49] Isaiah chapter 55 and verse 6.
[1:00:52] seek ye the Lord while he may be found
[1:00:56] call upon him while he is near
[1:00:59] let the wicked forsake his way the
[1:01:02] unrighteous man his thoughts let him
[1:01:04] return unto the Lord and He will have
[1:01:06] mercy upon him to our God I love this
[1:01:10] for he will abundantly
[1:01:15] pardon
[1:01:18] his Mercy never runs out
[1:01:23] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:01:25] neither are your ways my way saith the
[1:01:29] Lord for as the heavens are higher than
[1:01:32] the earth so are my ways higher than
[1:01:35] your ways and my thoughts then your
[1:01:38] thoughts
[1:01:42] I want to go back and grab a thought
[1:01:44] from last week don't go back and dig up
[1:01:48] bones
[1:01:49] [Music]
[1:01:54] those were not the good old days
[1:02:00] are you with me don't teach your
[1:02:03] children about your wickedness
[1:02:07] your children are growing up in a
[1:02:10] Christian atmosphere they don't need to
[1:02:13] know
[1:02:22] you're married to your wife and both of
[1:02:24] your Christians don't dig up old bones
[1:02:29] don't dig up old boyfriends and old
[1:02:31] girlfriend are you with me now that
[1:02:34] should never been be ever said in
[1:02:38] anybody's presence
[1:02:46] I'm going somewhere with this
[1:02:49] I cannot imagine salmon
[1:02:53] who becomes married to Rahab
[1:02:56] after they're married I don't care what
[1:02:59] everybody else's memory is
[1:03:02] I don't care what everybody else's
[1:03:04] thoughts is being a type of Jesus Christ
[1:03:08] I can believe that salmon never brought
[1:03:12] up her harlotry
[1:03:17] I can believe that salmon a prince of a
[1:03:20] man a captain of a man never brought up
[1:03:24] her harlotry
[1:03:27] because now she's married
[1:03:30] and she's part of the line of the tribe
[1:03:33] of Judah and through her womb it's going
[1:03:36] to come Jesus Christ
[1:03:43] are you with me
[1:03:45] I would say in the home of Boaz
[1:03:48] Boaz no doubt never brought up Ruth's
[1:03:52] past
[1:03:58] it's good for you
[1:04:00] he never brought up her past
[1:04:02] though she had a history just like you
[1:04:09] boy you got quiet
[1:04:13] though she had a history no doubt that
[1:04:16] had some very rugged moments she had
[1:04:18] been an idol worshiper
[1:04:21] from a country that was cursed
[1:04:24] but she told Naomi I will go where you
[1:04:28] go I'm going to go where you live I'm
[1:04:31] going to live your God is going to be my
[1:04:34] God
[1:04:35] her sister-in-law turned back to her
[1:04:37] guts
[1:04:39] but she made a decision not knowing she
[1:04:42] was going to become a woman of History
[1:04:47] but when Boaz purchased Naomi and
[1:04:51] purchased the property and purchased
[1:04:54] everything Ruth was included
[1:04:57] and he took her as a wife he was not
[1:05:00] ashamed of her
[1:05:03] God's not ashamed of you
[1:05:06] I have read to you he's going to give
[1:05:08] you a vesture he's going to give you
[1:05:11] clothes that are clean and white
[1:05:15] [Music]
[1:05:17] listen no memory in god of what you used
[1:05:21] to be
[1:05:25] hey that's the theme of the service this
[1:05:28] morning I I think it's going to be good
[1:05:32] our garments has been changed
[1:05:36] garments are important
[1:05:38] they have ultimate importance
[1:05:40] there's a wedding going to happen this
[1:05:42] week
[1:05:43] Sarah Beth is not going to show up
[1:05:48] in clothes like you would feed a hawk
[1:05:53] it's going to be a day I don't know it's
[1:05:56] going to be a day
[1:05:58] to which it which is dreamed of
[1:06:02] addressed to which she's dreamed of
[1:06:05] she's going to stand as a wife to Seth
[1:06:09] and he's not going to have a t-shirt
[1:06:13] torn jeans
[1:06:15] if you are
[1:06:18] I'm leaving
[1:06:23] I don't care what the nonsense of this
[1:06:25] world says
[1:06:29] I think God requires us to act like men
[1:06:32] and women
[1:06:43] I want to just say this to you today
[1:06:46] in our body we're either veiling one of
[1:06:48] two two powers
[1:06:50] you're either veiling God on the King on
[1:06:53] your heart
[1:06:55] or you're veiling the Devil Himself
[1:06:59] the influence from hell
[1:07:02] there's only two destinations Jesus
[1:07:05] talks more about hell than he talks
[1:07:07] about heaven
[1:07:11] so it's a place
[1:07:13] there's garments for both of them
[1:07:16] the garments we have just read about
[1:07:18] clean and holy clean and white
[1:07:22] there's not going to be any sin in
[1:07:24] heaven
[1:07:25] none of your past none of your history
[1:07:28] is ever going to be mentioned there
[1:07:33] the only thing that is man-made in
[1:07:35] heaven is the nail scars that will be in
[1:07:38] his hands
[1:07:40] in hell they also have a vesture it's
[1:07:43] called naked
[1:07:47] naked in hell
[1:07:50] naked in hell
[1:07:52] there's not going to be friends there
[1:07:54] there's not going to be parties
[1:07:57] it's going to be torment
[1:08:00] we realize it's not going to be Eternal
[1:08:02] because God made it
[1:08:04] so anything that's made is not eternal
[1:08:06] so but I want you to understand well
[1:08:08] brother Ron I want to argue with you
[1:08:10] about eternal hell this man was standing
[1:08:13] one day with me at a graveyard and he
[1:08:15] said you said hell's not eternal
[1:08:18] and so he began to jab at me a little
[1:08:20] bit and said God don't remember your
[1:08:22] sins he said God can remember everything
[1:08:24] and he just kept jabbing he kept trying
[1:08:26] to make a scene and I said I don't
[1:08:28] believe this is your wife that you're
[1:08:30] you're here with you've been living with
[1:08:32] your girlfriend
[1:08:35] you're arguing with me scriptures and
[1:08:37] you're standing in a sinful condition
[1:08:40] you better pray hell is not eternal
[1:08:48] I would say hell is 10 minutes is too
[1:08:51] much
[1:08:55] I'm glad that's not where I'm
[1:08:57] predestinated to go to
[1:08:58] [Music]
[1:09:08] you're procrastinated for a journey
[1:09:12] and if there's a literal Heaven which I
[1:09:14] believe and there's a literal hell
[1:09:18] I thank God that God chose me before the
[1:09:21] foundation of the world
[1:09:23] listen it wasn't because I was from a
[1:09:26] certain family or I was good enough
[1:09:29] all sin to come short of the glory of
[1:09:32] God but God chose us before the
[1:09:35] foundation of the world
[1:09:37] and for that we need to be extremely
[1:09:40] thankful
[1:09:41] the scripture says for God so loved the
[1:09:43] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:09:45] God don't send a man to Hell man's own
[1:09:48] choices sends him to hell
[1:09:50] but due to those choices men
[1:09:56] news
[1:10:04] to become nothing more animalistic flesh
[1:10:09] we realize that there are predestinated
[1:10:12] seat
[1:10:14] electric seat that will be the Bride of
[1:10:17] Jesus Christ
[1:10:19] but for others
[1:10:21] you're in a family and maybe you see the
[1:10:24] message of the hour and all of a sudden
[1:10:27] something comes to life inside of you
[1:10:29] and you go that's what I've been looking
[1:10:31] for all my life
[1:10:33] then maybe your brother or your sister
[1:10:35] or maybe even your spouse will go there
[1:10:38] ain't nothing about that I want I'm
[1:10:40] going as far as I can in non-seed
[1:10:43] there's nothing to Quicken
[1:10:48] in non-seed there's nothing to come to
[1:10:50] life
[1:10:54] it's like a bag of corn
[1:10:56] it is said certified seed there is a
[1:11:00] percentage of that that is in that bag
[1:11:03] that will never do anything
[1:11:07] cause it's nothing quick in there
[1:11:14] my dad would always point that out to me
[1:11:17] you know and dad would give Mark and
[1:11:20] myself instructions of what to do today
[1:11:22] and you know at home I was raised to
[1:11:25] work that's why I don't have any problem
[1:11:26] with it now
[1:11:29] I hate lazy people and don't I'm not
[1:11:31] going to get on that soapbox
[1:11:33] I disdain them
[1:11:36] I disdain lazy people
[1:11:40] that's got no ambition people that are
[1:11:43] count Sinners all their life
[1:11:46] generous those people that criticize
[1:11:48] everything that everybody else does the
[1:11:51] reason they do that they never done
[1:11:52] nothing
[1:11:56] there I got on that soapbox on Father's
[1:11:58] Day
[1:12:03] you know me and my brother enjoyed
[1:12:05] playing basketball my brother was about
[1:12:06] six inches taller than I was almost from
[1:12:09] birth
[1:12:14] and so we enjoyed playing basketball we
[1:12:17] had the Championships the NBA we had the
[1:12:19] World Championships right in my
[1:12:22] Grandma's driveway
[1:12:24] we would play for hours
[1:12:28] huh
[1:12:29] but we had to get our work done first
[1:12:32] and I was planting corn on this day
[1:12:35] I had a bag of corn to plant now man we
[1:12:37] had a big Garden
[1:12:39] a lot of potatoes a lot of corn a lot of
[1:12:41] corn a lot of corn did I say a lot of
[1:12:44] corn
[1:12:45] and I was coming toward the end and all
[1:12:47] of a sudden I I came to about the last
[1:12:49] two pounds
[1:12:51] I just dug a hole
[1:12:57] and I put two pounds in the ground and I
[1:13:00] said nobody will ever know
[1:13:03] but you know it's like the scripture
[1:13:05] said your sins will find you out
[1:13:09] you know it went good for a few weeks
[1:13:14] it went really good for a few weeks we
[1:13:17] played basketball we had a wonderful
[1:13:18] time
[1:13:20] a few weeks later my dad brought me up
[1:13:22] to the Garden we just took a walk he
[1:13:24] said let's take a walk I always hated
[1:13:26] when Dad said let's take a walk
[1:13:28] it's kind of like that day brother Homer
[1:13:30] said let's take a walk
[1:13:31] I was getting ready to get married to
[1:13:33] Sister Connie he said let's take a walk
[1:13:34] I hated those words I hated those words
[1:13:36] let's take a walk
[1:13:40] all right
[1:13:41] we walked to that place where I dug that
[1:13:44] hole
[1:13:47] every one of those seeds must have been
[1:13:49] certified
[1:13:53] that said today I'm going to teach you a
[1:13:56] lesson in life it's going to take you
[1:13:57] more than just a few minutes but you're
[1:13:59] going to take every one of those little
[1:14:02] spricks
[1:14:04] there's life in them
[1:14:06] and they had potential but you buried it
[1:14:09] now I want you to reach and reach down
[1:14:12] in there be real tender care and pull it
[1:14:15] up and I want you to replant it
[1:14:21] probably 200 of them baby dogs
[1:14:25] so it's all
[1:14:27] let's all do it right the first time
[1:14:39] if it's worth doing do it right
[1:14:43] then you don't have to redo it again
[1:14:53] so when you're being born again don't
[1:14:55] hold on to the original nature
[1:14:58] or you'll always have to revisit it
[1:15:02] and always revisit well I'm not going to
[1:15:05] get rid of that or I'm not going to I'm
[1:15:06] not going to quit doing that I will not
[1:15:08] surrender that you'll always fight with
[1:15:10] that thing
[1:15:11] tell you go back and dig it up
[1:15:20] invisible Union which is a powerful I
[1:15:23] think it's one of the most phenomenal
[1:15:25] the prophets standing there and now he's
[1:15:28] these are some of the last sermons that
[1:15:30] he'll preach it won't be long till his
[1:15:32] lips will be sealed
[1:15:34] and he's talking about the Bride of
[1:15:36] Jesus Christ
[1:15:38] and I think it's phenomenal he says
[1:15:41] now he's talking to you
[1:15:43] he said you separated from your first
[1:15:46] Union
[1:15:47] by spiritual death
[1:15:49] now you're born again
[1:15:52] remarried again
[1:15:54] to the new spiritual union
[1:15:57] of not your innate natural life to the
[1:16:01] things of the world
[1:16:03] but of eternal life
[1:16:05] that germ that was in you at the
[1:16:08] beginning
[1:16:10] found you
[1:16:12] quite a statement The Germ that was in
[1:16:15] you from the beginning
[1:16:18] found you
[1:16:19] now your old book is gone
[1:16:24] with your old union now your name in
[1:16:29] your old
[1:16:30] has been transferred now you say do you
[1:16:34] mean to tell me that my old book
[1:16:36] God put it in the sea of his
[1:16:39] forgetfulness
[1:16:41] and you stand perfectly before God
[1:16:46] now your name is now in the new book
[1:16:51] not the Book of Life
[1:16:54] but the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:16:57] what the lamb redeemed
[1:17:00] not the old book of your natural Union
[1:17:02] but the new bride Hallelujah your life
[1:17:07] is in the Lamb's Book of Life your
[1:17:10] marriage certificate
[1:17:12] Hallelujah were you were the true
[1:17:16] Eternal gen germ from the beginning
[1:17:19] takes hope
[1:17:22] and sometimes it takes hope differently
[1:17:25] in your life
[1:17:27] some of your ten some of your 20 we're
[1:17:29] going to baptize a Adonai how old is
[1:17:32] faith and so Adonai is five and she's
[1:17:35] been a wonderful young girl she's ready
[1:17:37] to be baptized Sarah is going to be
[1:17:40] baptized today I think this is your
[1:17:42] another maybe a second time maybe is
[1:17:45] that right
[1:17:45] and so anyway she's going to be baptized
[1:17:48] today I'm glad your mom's with you and
[1:17:50] so she's going to be baptized today and
[1:17:53] so all of us it takes a halt in
[1:17:56] different light different times of life
[1:17:59] but it takes a hope
[1:18:05] and he says no
[1:18:07] he says now
[1:18:08] you're not only forgiven
[1:18:10] this is so powerful
[1:18:12] but you're justifying
[1:18:15] Romans chapter 5 verse 1 therefore being
[1:18:19] justified by faith
[1:18:22] Look up the word
[1:18:24] the word don't mean forgiven
[1:18:27] the word means Justified
[1:18:30] it don't mean that you're forgiven for
[1:18:34] instance you heard I got drunk and done
[1:18:36] some evil things and everything and then
[1:18:38] you come around say to me you you found
[1:18:40] out that I didn't do them then you said
[1:18:42] brother Branham I forgive you
[1:18:45] forgive me
[1:18:46] I didn't do it
[1:18:50] I didn't do it
[1:18:53] I tell you I didn't know you may have
[1:18:55] heard I did it but I didn't do it
[1:18:59] I didn't do it in the first place now if
[1:19:02] I did do it I'm guilty
[1:19:04] but you could forgive me
[1:19:07] and I wouldn't be guilty
[1:19:09] but yet I'm not justified because I
[1:19:13] actually did it
[1:19:14] but the word Justified is as though you
[1:19:18] never did it
[1:19:22] as though you never did it in the first
[1:19:25] place now listen it's not how you look
[1:19:28] at yourself it's not how your neighbor
[1:19:30] looks at you I want to give you a real
[1:19:32] Point you're going to spend eternal life
[1:19:34] with God and he don't see nothing
[1:19:39] you're welcome to shout
[1:19:41] [Applause]
[1:19:49] you never did it in the first place
[1:19:52] God don't see it when he forgives you
[1:19:56] you're guilty of digging up the bones
[1:19:58] you're guilty of going back and pulling
[1:20:00] up bad things but God don't look at you
[1:20:03] like that
[1:20:04] so let me just point it why should you
[1:20:15] why should you
[1:20:17] I want to drive this brother Ron but I I
[1:20:19] don't get it then I'll preach it again
[1:20:21] two weeks from now
[1:20:23] I want you to get how God looks at you
[1:20:26] he don't look at you as a sinner
[1:20:31] [Applause]
[1:20:46] the word Justified it is as though you
[1:20:49] never done it
[1:20:52] it's not even regarded at all
[1:20:56] how is it done
[1:20:57] in God's book of the sea of
[1:20:59] forgetfulness
[1:21:01] your old book
[1:21:03] the marriage is divorced
[1:21:05] and it's dead
[1:21:10] I'm not getting a text
[1:21:13] shot
[1:21:15] and he says
[1:21:17] it's not even in the memories of God
[1:21:20] you're Justified and therefore being
[1:21:23] justified
[1:21:26] it was accused
[1:21:28] you was accused you never did it
[1:21:32] in the first place the old Union is the
[1:21:36] Sea of God's forgetfulness
[1:21:38] you wasn't married to it to begin with
[1:21:41] the bridegroom bore your shame
[1:21:46] himself in your place he took your place
[1:21:49] you were predestinated for him to be his
[1:21:53] bride before the foundation world I'm
[1:21:56] driving this now the Bible said you are
[1:21:59] the predestinated seat
[1:22:03] you got to believe that
[1:22:05] you got to take a hold of that I am his
[1:22:08] predestinated seed it's not what I think
[1:22:11] about myself it's what I believe what
[1:22:14] God said about me
[1:22:20] are you with me don't believe what
[1:22:22] others say about you
[1:22:29] believe what God says about you he said
[1:22:32] you're forgiven you're Justified it's as
[1:22:35] though you never did it
[1:22:37] and if he took all the old book that had
[1:22:39] a lot of accusations against you and he
[1:22:42] looked at it he knew it was there and he
[1:22:45] forgave you and Justified you and it's
[1:22:47] as though you never did it
[1:22:49] he being your husband will never point
[1:22:53] back to your original
[1:22:54] [Applause]
[1:23:07] those Eternal thoughts
[1:23:09] now manifested in flesh are sons of God
[1:23:13] even as we were so-called we did not
[1:23:18] become seed by the rebirth
[1:23:21] we were see
[1:23:24] and therefore
[1:23:27] hmm
[1:23:30] reborn for only the elect
[1:23:34] can be reborn
[1:23:37] because we were seed is the reason we
[1:23:40] could be quickened in non-seed there's
[1:23:44] nothing to Quicken
[1:23:49] hold this perfectly in mind
[1:23:51] let's take another step
[1:23:53] redeem needs to be by back
[1:23:56] it restores to the original owner
[1:23:59] God by his death the shed blood bought
[1:24:03] by his own
[1:24:06] he brought back the spoken word seed
[1:24:11] bright
[1:24:12] notice the words Jesus says my sheep
[1:24:16] hear my voice
[1:24:18] and they follow me you always were a
[1:24:22] sheep
[1:24:24] come on come on
[1:24:27] I want you to get it you always were a
[1:24:30] sheep
[1:24:33] you always were a sheep you didn't act
[1:24:36] like it you may have did a lot of bad
[1:24:38] things but you always was a sheep
[1:24:41] that's why you couldn't find
[1:24:43] satisfaction in the world
[1:24:47] that's why you and your friends were
[1:24:49] much different there was something on
[1:24:51] the inside of you you were born for
[1:24:54] another kingdom
[1:24:57] and this world's not your home we're
[1:25:00] just passing through
[1:25:06] you tried this you tried that you tried
[1:25:09] this you tried that you tried this you
[1:25:11] look for love in the wrong place it's
[1:25:13] about one day God rich in his Mercy
[1:25:16] reach down and picks you up
[1:25:20] and then you realize I have been born
[1:25:23] for this all the time I never was at
[1:25:26] home in this world
[1:25:29] [Music]
[1:25:30] Hallelujah
[1:25:38] you never was a pig
[1:25:42] you never was a dog
[1:25:45] turned to it into a sheep
[1:25:51] I love my dog
[1:25:54] history says that you'll have anywhere
[1:25:57] from 7 to 17 different pet dogs in your
[1:26:01] life
[1:26:02] some of you don't like dogs but for
[1:26:03] those that like dogs
[1:26:06] some of you don't like cats but for
[1:26:07] those like cats
[1:26:09] I got Ted and Judy at my house
[1:26:13] they're the best mousers they're the
[1:26:15] best ground molars they're the best
[1:26:17] sneakers
[1:26:18] and they we got copperheads at my place
[1:26:21] and they'll they'll bring them right up
[1:26:23] on my porch there thank the Lord
[1:26:26] little rat little rattlesnake the other
[1:26:29] day and a little rattlesnake up on the
[1:26:31] porch dead sometimes their head will
[1:26:33] swell up and
[1:26:34] I'll give them Benadryl
[1:26:37] I'm not taking them to the doctor and
[1:26:39] spending five thousand dollars on them
[1:26:42] Hey listen I'm I'm sorry
[1:26:45] they die I'll get another dog okay I'll
[1:26:47] get another cat I'm not harmless here
[1:26:53] but if I die somebody will feed them
[1:26:55] tomorrow
[1:26:56] there ain't no whine and cry all day
[1:26:58] long
[1:27:01] there's another stump
[1:27:06] but my dogs are not redeemable
[1:27:11] my dogs won't turn into human beings
[1:27:14] they're not going to do it
[1:27:17] my cats are not they may be Ted and Judy
[1:27:21] but there's a whole lot better Judy
[1:27:22] sitting back there than it's sitting
[1:27:24] there
[1:27:25] they will not let me rub them they will
[1:27:27] not let me pick them up they will not
[1:27:29] let me hold them almost like another
[1:27:31] little girl here
[1:27:33] but she warmed up to me this week
[1:27:36] we thank the Lord for that
[1:27:39] you see as human beings we had a first
[1:27:43] nature
[1:27:45] well that baby died that King died
[1:27:49] it's got to die
[1:27:52] and listen the only reason that it it's
[1:27:54] that that you would even want it to die
[1:27:56] is you met a new king
[1:28:02] the potential was inside of you
[1:28:06] are you with me now
[1:28:07] you had two different little Natures lay
[1:28:09] it on the inside of you I'm not
[1:28:11] preaching too so but you had two little
[1:28:13] Natures laying on the inside of one was
[1:28:15] dormant when you were born born of your
[1:28:18] original nature but one day God began to
[1:28:21] deal with your heart you came to church
[1:28:24] and all of a sudden you started crying
[1:28:25] you started weeping you started you
[1:28:27] didn't know why
[1:28:30] one sister told me she said I was
[1:28:32] leaving the building as hard as I could
[1:28:33] because you made me mad the next thing I
[1:28:36] know I was at the altar giving my heart
[1:28:37] to the Lord
[1:28:44] I was thinking about
[1:28:46] I was thinking about you know sometimes
[1:28:48] the word will actually jab us
[1:28:50] our original nature were getting mad
[1:28:53] you know listen it's you know if the
[1:28:55] word comes across and just starts
[1:28:57] cleaning you a little bit don't get mad
[1:28:59] just open your arm and go yeah Lord I
[1:29:01] need to be scrubbed there a little bit
[1:29:12] the other day I was at the doctor
[1:29:14] Matthew went with me and
[1:29:16] they pulled my toes apart they were
[1:29:19] looking he said I know you don't like it
[1:29:21] and I said not necessarily
[1:29:24] he said pull my toes apart and he was
[1:29:26] looking he said the cancers can get
[1:29:28] inside of your inside of your toes he
[1:29:30] said that melanoma will hide we'll hide
[1:29:32] where you can't see it and he said we
[1:29:33] gotta look we got to look and we got to
[1:29:35] look and you know and then once he looks
[1:29:38] and he finds something
[1:29:39] he'll he'll get to stick
[1:29:42] and then he'll get a little scalpel
[1:29:44] and he'll start digging and when he digs
[1:29:47] you know it hurts I I'll be honest with
[1:29:50] you you'll spray a little something on
[1:29:51] it but that spray really don't work that
[1:29:53] well so he'll spray a little something
[1:29:54] and then he takes that thing and he just
[1:29:56] cuts it and he cuts it real hard
[1:30:01] I'll moan
[1:30:03] but I know it's doing me good
[1:30:06] because that little thing if I leave it
[1:30:08] alone will go in my body
[1:30:14] listen I I didn't do sunglasses in my
[1:30:17] life so I got a tumor in my eye and it
[1:30:20] was in my left eye and I got cancer in
[1:30:22] there I got cancer on my face I got
[1:30:24] cancer on my arms
[1:30:26] and and I didn't know it but I left it
[1:30:29] alone and and then it got in my my lymph
[1:30:31] nodes and then it got in my lungs and
[1:30:33] then it got in my brain
[1:30:35] now we fight it with chemo but had it
[1:30:38] been originally we could have caught it
[1:30:40] I'm preaching to you now
[1:30:43] if you could catch it in time it won't
[1:30:45] destroy your body that's why you got to
[1:30:48] destroy your enemy
[1:30:49] before your enemy destroys you
[1:30:53] [Applause]
[1:31:01] you say brother on I don't want to talk
[1:31:03] about that part of my life let it die
[1:31:05] out
[1:31:07] let it die out don't let it rule you
[1:31:10] don't let it constantly Burr at you
[1:31:16] it's like pornography
[1:31:18] it's a hidden thing it's a quiet thing
[1:31:20] it's a it's a thing that we people do in
[1:31:23] private
[1:31:24] but it's a thing that destroys them and
[1:31:27] they become addicted to it
[1:31:31] Satan will only talked you into doing it
[1:31:34] once or twice and then you'll become
[1:31:35] addicted to it
[1:31:37] maybe your wife don't know maybe your
[1:31:39] girlfriend don't know but you're
[1:31:40] addicted to a certain thing listen
[1:31:42] that's somebody else's wife
[1:31:45] that's somebody else's husband
[1:31:51] and maybe you get bored in life
[1:31:54] and all of a sudden your husband don't
[1:31:55] give you the 1500 words a day what women
[1:31:59] have fifteen thousand words and Men is
[1:32:02] allotted 1500 words major difference
[1:32:06] and maybe your husband you know he don't
[1:32:08] talk to you a whole lot that don't give
[1:32:10] you a right
[1:32:12] to go back to old boyfriends
[1:32:15] [Applause]
[1:32:17] it don't give you a right to go back and
[1:32:19] and try to rekindle all things it'll
[1:32:22] destroy you
[1:32:26] that's the Bride of Jesus Christ we
[1:32:28] don't need another lover
[1:32:32] we can't be in love with the world and
[1:32:34] in love with God at the same time you

[1:33:01] I think my wife's having an affair
[1:33:05] all of her mind this audience got dead
[1:33:08] quiet
[1:33:10] and he went on for about 20 minutes
[1:33:13] before he revealed his thing
[1:33:15] the Bride of Jesus Christ don't need to
[1:33:17] be in love with the world
[1:33:20] you can't be in love with the world and
[1:33:23] in love with God at the same time
[1:33:25] simply put your priorities is here
[1:33:30] your priorities is to Worship the Lord
[1:33:33] your priorities is to put the God first
[1:33:37] I can't do that brother Ron well let me
[1:33:39] just say this you haven't died out
[1:33:46] sometimes things are difficult like a
[1:33:48] little little thing about that tumor
[1:33:51] between your toes
[1:33:53] huh
[1:33:55] brother Billy Andrews stood in here how
[1:33:57] many remember brother Billy Andrews
[1:33:58] Billy was sharp to the point him and
[1:34:01] Homer were great buddies great friends
[1:34:02] and we just enjoyed it
[1:34:06] Billy Andrews was standing here one
[1:34:08] night and
[1:34:09] and you know he was telling about how
[1:34:12] sometimes it's difficult for women to
[1:34:15] train change their dress
[1:34:17] to the message of Howard and to how God
[1:34:20] wants us to dress listen if God wants us
[1:34:22] to be a certain way that's exactly the
[1:34:23] way I want to be I don't make the rules
[1:34:25] I I just preach what he says
[1:34:28] so
[1:34:32] and I know this story really well Billy
[1:34:35] had a sister all right
[1:34:37] I was there right after it happened they
[1:34:39] were at a family reunion
[1:34:41] and Billy's sister was kind of a doll
[1:34:43] baby and they were in Nashville area and
[1:34:46] you know it was that it was that country
[1:34:49] doll baby atmosphere
[1:34:52] and uh she was a black-headed
[1:34:55] uh
[1:34:58] Dolly Parton
[1:35:05] and so she was standing there
[1:35:09] unchristian-like
[1:35:11] dressed in front of Billy
[1:35:13] and she's kind of taunting him a little
[1:35:15] bit honestly she was just kind of
[1:35:17] taunting him a little bit and she said
[1:35:19] Billy how do I look she wasn't expecting
[1:35:21] the answer that she got
[1:35:25] now listen if you want if you want to
[1:35:27] know the facts ask God
[1:35:30] if you want to know the facts ask a real
[1:35:33] Holy Ghost preacher not one of these
[1:35:34] compromising patch you on the back
[1:35:39] worried about your money
[1:35:42] not word whether we get the mayor of the
[1:35:44] city or the governor of the of the state
[1:35:49] you might know him you might love them
[1:35:50] but we're not really interested in that
[1:35:54] and Billy said you want to know how I
[1:35:56] think you look
[1:35:57] he said I can see the blue flames of
[1:36:01] hell
[1:36:03] coming up around you
[1:36:08] said brother Ron that was hard for him
[1:36:09] to even say in front of a it was true
[1:36:12] he was honest
[1:36:14] he was just that honest
[1:36:19] did she get mad
[1:36:23] did you take an attitude
[1:36:26] did she disclaimed him
[1:36:29] no because when he was telling the story
[1:36:32] she was setting about where you're
[1:36:34] sitting
[1:36:36] and she stood to her feet and screamed
[1:36:39] Hallelujah he told me the truth
[1:36:45] remember that Sister Nancy she's a
[1:36:47] beautiful lady
[1:36:48] and she served the Lord she may be still
[1:36:50] alive now she may be watching this
[1:36:52] service I'm thankful
[1:36:57] I'm really honest with you I'm thankful
[1:37:02] I'm thankful
[1:37:05] that a preacher will tell us the truth
[1:37:08] [Applause]
[1:37:36] I'm thankful our Prophet told us the
[1:37:38] truth
[1:37:43] I won't be good I won't be much longer
[1:37:45] but
[1:37:46] I think this point these are some points
[1:37:48] that I need to drive
[1:37:55] there's a great disturbance going on
[1:37:58] in the world today
[1:38:01] because there's a new King in England
[1:38:05] his name is Charles
[1:38:10] and you know we're Americans and
[1:38:12] sometimes we get you know we get our
[1:38:14] different colored glasses on it
[1:38:16] you know we'll think what a shame what a
[1:38:19] shame one son is a he follows the
[1:38:22] protocol
[1:38:23] you know as a king
[1:38:25] that King has a certain dress where that
[1:38:28] he dresses in
[1:38:30] yes this week he has brought back into
[1:38:32] order that he will ride a horse in the
[1:38:34] parade it never has been done for about
[1:38:37] 40 years
[1:38:38] he's going to pick up the duties that
[1:38:40] need to be done as a kink
[1:38:43] he's going to follow what the king's
[1:38:45] order says for him to do and he's got
[1:38:47] stripes and he's got buttons and
[1:38:49] everything means a certain thing
[1:38:52] he's over top of a a certain he's over
[1:38:55] top of a church he's over top of a
[1:38:57] military he's over top of the government
[1:38:59] it may seem fake for a while and you may
[1:39:01] think well that's a fake deal that's
[1:39:03] just a facade just just let him stop the
[1:39:07] money flow
[1:39:09] you find what he's over top of
[1:39:12] but he has a son that is following him
[1:39:14] in the duties
[1:39:16] that son married a girl of royalty
[1:39:20] the rule says that you marry a a girl of
[1:39:25] royal descent and that lineage has to go
[1:39:28] back and she has to be so pure and she
[1:39:30] has to be a certain way she has to have
[1:39:32] a certain education she has to have a
[1:39:34] certain family she has to have a certain
[1:39:36] character about her
[1:39:39] so the first son he married a girl who
[1:39:42] is Kate Middleton he married a girl that
[1:39:45] fit the protocol
[1:39:48] then they have children that now become
[1:39:51] under the lineage of the king
[1:39:54] but there's another son that you know
[1:39:56] he's he's just rebellious
[1:39:58] he's constantly been rebellious he's
[1:40:00] he's I'm not saying anything it's not in
[1:40:02] the news
[1:40:04] and he's you know he's laid with this
[1:40:06] when he's been a Playboy he's went all
[1:40:08] over the world and they tried to pull
[1:40:10] him back in the queen tried to pull him
[1:40:12] back in she called him in I've been
[1:40:15] making notes for a while because this is
[1:40:16] so special
[1:40:17] and she called him in trying to get him
[1:40:20] they he was in the military he was he
[1:40:22] did great things in the military he did
[1:40:24] great things and a lot of things but but
[1:40:26] you know even in the even in the duties
[1:40:29] of of giving money away and going to
[1:40:32] Africa and create Wells and taking care
[1:40:34] of children
[1:40:36] but he refused to follow protocol
[1:40:40] and in refusing to follow protocol he he
[1:40:43] went with different women that didn't
[1:40:44] meet the criteria
[1:40:46] [Music]
[1:40:48] and then he married a Hollywood star
[1:40:52] he married a girl that
[1:40:55] that fits in the American agenda
[1:41:00] don't you get quiet
[1:41:06] and now he's mad because he don't get to
[1:41:08] be in the king's deal
[1:41:11] he can't be in the Inner Circle he's not
[1:41:13] allowed to live in a certain place that
[1:41:15] was given to him
[1:41:18] he can live there and have servants and
[1:41:20] have security
[1:41:22] [Music]
[1:41:24] just to give you an idea his security is
[1:41:27] 450 000 a month and he's been whining
[1:41:30] over the last month that he's going to
[1:41:31] have to pay for that
[1:41:33] well baby doll you made choices
[1:41:37] [Applause]
[1:41:39] you made choices that you were going to
[1:41:42] rebel and there was an order that the
[1:41:45] king had to follow
[1:41:47] he didn't make the choice
[1:41:51] the boy made the choice
[1:41:55] are you with me now now he's upset he
[1:41:58] can't be in the lineage of the king he
[1:42:00] can't get all the all of the benefits of
[1:42:02] living in the family but he made a
[1:42:04] choice not to follow protocol
[1:42:08] this is God's protocol
[1:42:11] [Applause]
[1:42:32] how many remember brother Guido
[1:42:37] brother Guido was with me and
[1:42:40] we were talking about this line of
[1:42:42] thought
[1:42:43] and brother Guido said that
[1:42:47] brother Guido said
[1:42:49] there was a princess
[1:42:52] there was a princess that
[1:42:57] that would go to the war they kept the
[1:42:59] horses
[1:43:00] and she was warned
[1:43:03] don't give your heart away to the wrong
[1:43:05] man
[1:43:08] and she fell in love with a stable
[1:43:10] keeper
[1:43:15] this wasn't England
[1:43:17] but she fell in love with a stable
[1:43:19] keeper and her father brought her in and
[1:43:22] she said but I love him and he said but
[1:43:24] you were warned not to give your heart
[1:43:27] away
[1:43:28] to the wrong person well it feels good
[1:43:32] yeah
[1:43:34] and I'm in love with him but he's a
[1:43:36] stable keeper
[1:43:39] you know what she did she married that
[1:43:41] boy
[1:43:42] and you know what the father had to do
[1:43:44] banish her
[1:43:47] from the family
[1:43:51] that boy only made dollars an hour
[1:43:54] he couldn't provide for her what she
[1:43:56] lived in the first day
[1:43:58] all of her life
[1:44:01] as a princess
[1:44:04] don't she be born she made a choice
[1:44:07] to marry a stable keeper
[1:44:10] The Story Goes On to say that they lived
[1:44:13] in a one-room house the rest of their
[1:44:15] life but she could have lived in a
[1:44:17] castle
[1:44:19] it wasn't the king's fault
[1:44:23] it's not God's fault here
[1:44:26] he's going to be the judge he's going to
[1:44:29] be the bridegroom he's going to have a
[1:44:31] wife and she will be without spot or she
[1:44:34] will be without blemish but I want to
[1:44:37] tell you don't give your heart away
[1:44:41] to another lover
[1:44:53] God sent you a message not just you he
[1:44:56] sent around the world
[1:44:58] a message
[1:44:59] there is going to be a bride
[1:45:04] God's there there is going to be a
[1:45:07] tribulation period
[1:45:09] there is going to be a heaven and hell
[1:45:12] but God sent you a message well I don't
[1:45:14] believe it he's not going to send
[1:45:16] another one
[1:45:20] if this message didn't awaken you
[1:45:23] I'm sorry
[1:45:26] I I'm really sorry
[1:45:28] the last family reunion was about a
[1:45:30] hundred people
[1:45:31] at the Spencer reunion I didn't know
[1:45:34] most of them
[1:45:35] I left as soon as I could
[1:45:40] that ain't my family
[1:45:45] my grandmother became a message believer
[1:45:47] she had a vision of who William Branham
[1:45:50] was my daddy gave her a book The Way of
[1:45:52] a true Prophet she opened the book and
[1:45:54] that was the that was brother Branham
[1:45:55] that was the man in division
[1:45:58] she never doubted it she believed it
[1:46:01] with all of her heart my grandfather
[1:46:03] hated it with everything that was within
[1:46:05] him
[1:46:06] it didn't change her
[1:46:09] my daddy's baby daughter
[1:46:12] she's now back in church
[1:46:15] she's now re-baptized but she was a
[1:46:18] Believer for many years and got away
[1:46:20] but now she's back thank God for Grace
[1:46:24] thank God for Grace
[1:46:26] but many of my father's siblings
[1:46:28] absolutely hated this message it didn't
[1:46:31] matter
[1:46:32] God didn't come down say I'm sorry I
[1:46:35] sent the wrong Messengers he sent the
[1:46:37] one
[1:46:41] he sent the one
[1:46:47] I had a friend of mine write me this
[1:46:49] morning Happy Father's Day from new New
[1:46:52] Zealand
[1:46:54] when I got off the plane
[1:46:57] I didn't know who he was never met him
[1:46:59] before
[1:47:00] I shook his hand I traveled 31 hours
[1:47:03] I shook his hand
[1:47:07] and it was like we hadn't
[1:47:09] never been apart
[1:47:12] we rattled
[1:47:15] for about seven days
[1:47:17] it's like I'd met a brother that was
[1:47:19] long that I never met and now we because
[1:47:23] we stepped out of Eternity
[1:47:27] into time
[1:47:28] and now God brings us together
[1:47:31] I've gotta I've gotta I've got a note
[1:47:33] right here from Tom Ray while I've been
[1:47:35] preaching
[1:47:36] listen I don't talk to Tom every day
[1:47:39] but let me just say when I met Tom Ray
[1:47:42] it was like I met a brother from my
[1:47:43] family that I'd never met before and we
[1:47:46] can just talk and talk and talk and talk
[1:47:48] and talk we have different backgrounds
[1:47:49] we have different histories but we
[1:47:51] stepped out of Eternity into time
[1:47:54] am I getting you there we're a family
[1:47:56] here
[1:48:00] we're a family here
[1:48:09] it doesn't matter what the world says
[1:48:11] against us
[1:48:12] it doesn't matter what they're doing or
[1:48:14] you're with me they're charted one
[1:48:17] course and we're charted another
[1:48:18] [Applause]
[1:48:24] now let me let me just
[1:48:27] can I pick this up in a couple weeks or
[1:48:29] three weeks or
[1:48:30] so I don't do this too much so
[1:48:34] we took off the old coat
[1:48:40] that old coat was abusive
[1:48:43] yeah I've lost a little weight it'll be
[1:48:45] okay
[1:48:46] that old coat was abusive
[1:48:49] did a lot of bad things to this body
[1:48:52] that old coat was abusive
[1:48:55] they gave me a new one
[1:48:59] so I took off the old coat
[1:49:01] and I put on a new
[1:49:06] so you'll take off a t-shirt
[1:49:10] and put on a tuxedo
[1:49:16] because it's an event
[1:49:19] so God's gonna give you a new body
[1:49:26] because you can when the presence of God
[1:49:28] comes down and you shout and you dance
[1:49:30] and you praise the Lord just as soon as
[1:49:32] it's over your body's going
[1:49:35] oh I'm so tired
[1:49:39] so God's going to give you a new body
[1:49:41] so you're going to lay off the old coat
[1:49:46] he's going to give you a new one
[1:49:49] I'm finished with this
[1:49:53] Jesus tells us a parable
[1:49:57] of the wedding supper
[1:50:00] and there was a man there that didn't
[1:50:01] have on the right garment
[1:50:06] he didn't have on the right garment
[1:50:07] garment I'll get to it in three weeks
[1:50:12] the right garment's important
[1:50:16] we're not looking for a Baptist garment
[1:50:20] we're not looking for a Catholic garment
[1:50:23] we're looking for the word
[1:50:26] if you don't understand that don't let
[1:50:28] that offend you just keep eating pie
[1:50:31] but we're looking for the wedding
[1:50:33] garments
[1:50:36] can I just pull that up just for a
[1:50:37] moment listen when Esther came into the
[1:50:40] kingdom
[1:50:41] there was there was hundreds of virgins
[1:50:45] that were presented to the king
[1:50:48] and they were given all the riches of
[1:50:50] the kingdom of what what could they
[1:50:52] would want to be as a queen but Esther
[1:50:56] did something that was extremely
[1:50:57] important
[1:50:59] she asked the Elder servant
[1:51:02] what does the king like
[1:51:07] [Applause]
[1:51:19] I'll finish with this
[1:51:21] so when the king saw Esther
[1:51:26] he saw himself
[1:51:32] saw himself in her
[1:51:36] he couldn't turn her down
[1:51:40] because she was everything that he
[1:51:42] wanted in a wife
[1:51:49] so so when God looks at you and he sees
[1:51:53] himself in you
[1:52:01] he can't turn you down
[1:52:07] punch your neighbor and say did you get
[1:52:09] it
[1:52:15] I saw your light your eyes light up
[1:52:17] right there when he sees himself in you
[1:52:23] he can't turn you down
[1:52:30] I've had a good time
[1:52:35] I've had a good time
[1:52:37] Matthew you mind singing with me
[1:52:45] and Donnie Nicholson sang together
[1:52:49] I don't sing with Andrew because he blew
[1:52:50] me away
[1:52:53] I'll sing with you though I'll sing with
[1:52:55] you
[1:52:58] [Applause]
[1:53:05] thank you
[1:53:09] when I was in a fire he didn't walk away
[1:53:11] he risked his own life to pull me out
[1:53:14] Happy Father's Day Aunt Matthew
[1:53:18] Hallelujah
[1:53:19] mom told me that I wasn't tall dark and
[1:53:21] handsome that was my Father's Day
[1:53:24] and me telling you that I'll sing with
[1:53:26] you and not Andrew that's your Father's
[1:53:28] Day
[1:53:30] [Applause]

[1:53:41] okay two coats two coats
