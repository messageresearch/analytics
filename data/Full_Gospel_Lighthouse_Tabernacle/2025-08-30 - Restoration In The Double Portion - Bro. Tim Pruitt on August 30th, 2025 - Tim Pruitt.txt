And you know, I found out Harrisonenberg was named after one of my cousins. So, you know, we got I got relatives all over the sen candida valley that was buried here. I don't know why they didn't stay and kept going toward Texas because it's a lot prettier here. But anyway, we certainly love you and appreciate you. God bless you. Amen. Let's turn to the scripture. Let's go to Second Kings chapter 2 and verse 9. And I want to read together here this word tonight. And just pray that the Lord would help us. Now in 2 Kings 2:9 it says, "And it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha, ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee." And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee. But if not, it shall not be so. And it came to pass as they went on and talked that behold, there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and and parted them both a thunder. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. And Elisha saw it, and he cried, "My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, the horsemen thereof." And he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. And he took off also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the of Jordan. And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smokeote the waters and said, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah?" And when he had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither. And Elisha went over. And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, "The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha." and they came to meet him and bowed themselves be to the ground before him. God bless you. You can be seated. I want to speak tonight on restoration and the double portion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're going to speak about Elijah and Elisha tonight because just as Elisha picked up the mantle of Elijah and smoke the waters crying, where is the Lord God of Elijah? So in our day according to Malachi 4:5 and 6, the the spirit of Elijah has come again with the mantle of restoration, &gt;&gt; bringing us back to the faith of our fathers. &gt;&gt; And of course, these these mystery revealed truths. They're not new doctrines. They're they were eternal mysteries that were hidden in God, but are now unveiled to the bride for her final perfection. Right. &gt;&gt; And all we have to do is look back at Elijah and Elisha to know what we must do because they're a prophecy of the end time &gt;&gt; as most every character of the scripture is. As as message believers, we're well aware of Elijah being a prophecy of the end time. &gt;&gt; But sometimes we often overlook the important truth of Elisha's prophecy. &gt;&gt; And these are not just historical accounts. They're they're shadows of what God would do in this last day. &gt;&gt; Now, God would use the Old Testament to foreshadow the new. &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brandham preached the sermon, Christ is the mystery of God revealed because the coming of Christ and his redemptive plan was foreshadowed in the lives of men and women in the Old Testament because they were prophesying of you. As the Bible said that now all these things happened unto them for examples and they were written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come. &gt;&gt; And here we are right at the end time and we see these scriptures being fulfilled. And you are the embodiment of those scriptures. &gt;&gt; They they were the prophecies. You are the fulfillment. And Isaiah prophesied of a day when the moon would shine like the sun. A prophecy of the bride that would reflect the full light of Christ. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 30:26 said, "Moreover, the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days, &gt;&gt; in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and health the stroke of their wound." Amen. &gt;&gt; And of course, we know the moon represents the bride who reflects the light of the sun. &gt;&gt; And the sevenfold light is the combined of revelation of all the seven ages poured into this final age. That's right. &gt;&gt; And Revelation 10:1 shows we're coming with his face shining like the sun &gt;&gt; in full strength, revealing scriptures that were once hidden in obscurity. for the bride will shine with the same light that Christ had at the beginning. &gt;&gt; And Elijah's ministry, you know, it brought a drought on the kingdom of Jezebel. You know, a Ahab was only a figurehead and and because Jezebel ruled and and filled Israel with idolatry. &gt;&gt; And at Mount Carmel, Elijah brought his showdown and said, "How long you between two opinions? If the Lord be God, then follow him. But if veil, then follow him. &gt;&gt; And he demonstrated that the gods of Jezebel were powerless by calling down the fire of the living God. &gt;&gt; So when we look at Elijah, we see first he was a restorer of mystery truth. He rebuilt the altar of the Lord with 12 stones. He didn't go and make a new religion. He went and got the stones that had been discarded and he brought them back and he built an altar. He set the sacrifice in order and then the fire of God came down and consumed it and God accepted it. &gt;&gt; So in this age, the stones of truth had been scattered by denominationalism. Revelation 10:7 declares the seventh angel gathers them back into place and he finishes the mysteries. &gt;&gt; And the mysteries are the truths of the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; The life under the rule of Christ through the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You see Jesus said, "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Paul declared that the kingdom of God is life in the Holy Ghost when he said in Romans 14:17, "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but it is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation, for behold, the kingdom of God is within you." Yes. &gt;&gt; And Paul was declaring the kingdom is not external religion and arguing about what meat you eat &gt;&gt; or what kind of clothes you wear &gt;&gt; or those creed. Those are creeds of men. But the kingdom of God is the rule of Christ in the heart by the Holy Ghost. And wherever the spirit rules, there will be righteousness, joy, and peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The kingdom of God is not trees. It is not thorns. It is not sex. It is a life in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And true conversion brings you under Christ's government. &gt;&gt; His word ruling then in your heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the parables of Jesus, the wise and the foolish virgins, the weed and the terrors and all of these that he called the mysteries of the kingdom, they all show the mysteries. Only through the baptism of the Holy Ghost do we enter into it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And this is why we are not following cunningly devised fables, &gt;&gt; nor just interpretations of men. But but you see we we are standing in the fulfillment of prophecy &gt;&gt; where the bride reflects the sun with sevenfold light &gt;&gt; restored to the original altar filled with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and ready for a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not called to reformation but to restoration. &gt;&gt; We are not called to human interpretation but to spirit and truth. Elijah has come. The altar has been rebuilt. The fire has fallen. And now the bride must walk across Jordan with the mantel of Christ shining with the full light of the sun. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus asked the question as to why he presented much of the word in in parables and symbolic form that men can't fully grasp without revelation given by the spirit. He said in Matthew 13:11, he said, "Because it is given to you &gt;&gt; to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, &gt;&gt; but to them it is not given." &gt;&gt; Now, I just want to just cover a few of the mystery truths that have been restored. I I couldn't get them all tonight, but I just want to go through a few and keep in mind that so these are some of the stones of truth that Elijah restores that must be in our altar of worship. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Now, of course, one of the mystery truths is there is but one God, &gt;&gt; not two or three. And the greatest revelation of all is the supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. &gt;&gt; And Paul said plainly, "For in him dwelleth the fullness of the Godhead bodily." &gt;&gt; Jesus declared, "The Son can do nothing himself, but the Father dwelleth in me. He doeth the works." So the eternal father, the spirit lived in him, expressing himself through the world. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, Satan hates his truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He hates his truth. &gt;&gt; Satan has always hated the revelation of God in Christ. &gt;&gt; That is why he constantly tries to distort deity. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; How does he do that? By exalting men above Christ. Yeah. &gt;&gt; By deifying prophets or leaders. &gt;&gt; By reducing Jesus Christ to just a man &gt;&gt; or only an elder brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even in our day, Satan has even tried to make brother Brandham equal with Christ. &gt;&gt; Claiming he was God in the flesh or that every word that he said was thus sayeth the Lord. That's not the spirit of Christ. That's anity spirit. &gt;&gt; It's a demonic distortion. Brother Brandham was a man. He wasn't God. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was a prophet, a human being chosen by God. &gt;&gt; Anointed with the spirit of Christ. &gt;&gt; The same spirit that rested upon Elijah. And his commission was to declare the message of restoration to this last generation. &gt;&gt; But he was still a man. &gt;&gt; That's right, sir. Now his voice was an instrument God used. &gt;&gt; The word came through him but he himself was not the word. &gt;&gt; To deify every word he spoke is to deify his humanity and make him go &gt;&gt; which he never claimed to be. &gt;&gt; And to make this claim is antichrist. It is the poison of the serpent. &gt;&gt; Now I just want you to consider John the Baptist. You know he was also Elijah. &gt;&gt; And the scripture said he came in the spirit in the power of Elias. &gt;&gt; He was the voice of one crying in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? &gt;&gt; But note carefully. John was the voice, not the one crying. &gt;&gt; God was the one crying to his people. &gt;&gt; And John was simply the voice box. He pointed to the lamb of God saying, "He must increase and I must decrease." &gt;&gt; And yet when John was in prison, he sent his disciples to ask Jesus, "Are thou the one or shall we do we look for another?" You see, that was a man speaking, a prophet, a human questioning, wrestling with doubt. John was God's chosen vessel, but he was still a human that was subject to weakness. John was not the voice of God. He was a voice that God used. &gt;&gt; Likewise, brother Brandham was not the voice of God. He was a man whose voice God used. &gt;&gt; And the same is true. God still anoints men. &gt;&gt; But the but the anointing is not the man. &gt;&gt; The prophet is the voice, but Christ is the word. And the spirit rushing on Elijah, on John, on brother Brandham was the spirit of Christ. But the vessel was human. &gt;&gt; So that means the greatest revelation still remains unshaken. The supreme revelation of of is unchanged. God was in Christ &gt;&gt; reconciling the world to himself. Not God in Moses, not God in Paul, not God in brother Brandham. It was God in Christ. &gt;&gt; And Moses was God's servant. Paul was God's messenger. Brother Brandham was God's prophet. But only Jesus Christ was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. &gt;&gt; And in and in the unveiling of God, brother Brandon makes the distinction. And he said, "Now we find here now since Pentecost, God is not acting in man. He's acting through man. He was acting in a man then, Jesus. And he's acting through a man that he has chosen. Now he is acting through a man that he has chosen for this purpose." Notice in Jesus Christ, God acted in a man. He was Emmanuel, God with us. Right? &gt;&gt; The word became flesh &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us. But since Pentecost, God acts through man. &gt;&gt; He anoints his prophets, his apostles, his preachers, but he doesn't incarnate himself in them. &gt;&gt; The vessel is human and the anointing is divine. &gt;&gt; Now, why does this distinction matter? Because Satan always tries to blur this line. He wants to exalt man into Godhood and reduce Jesus Christ to mere humanity. And both are errors. &gt;&gt; To deify Paul or Moses or brother Brandham is idolatry. &gt;&gt; To to deny the deity of Jesus Christ is heresy. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Even brother Brandham warned against this. He was a man, a prophet, chosen, vindicated, but not God. &gt;&gt; He was a voice. &gt;&gt; But the voice was carrying God's word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; As John was the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Yet the cry itself was God's cry to his people. &gt;&gt; Now the Bible is plain. Colossians 1:19 says, "For it pleased the Father that in him should all the fullness dwell." Amen. It says in Colossians 2:9, "In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." &gt;&gt; There is no prophet, no apostle, no messenger can ever hold that position. &gt;&gt; Only Christ is the incarnate God, the lamb of God, the word made flesh. So the greatest revelation stands firm. God was in Christ and today he works through men and a portion of his spirit dwelleth in them anointing them for his purpose. But the fullness dwelt in Jesus Christ alone. &gt;&gt; That same Christ by the Holy Ghost now indwells the bride. Not making her God, but his body on earth, reflecting his word and his life until the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, Jesus was both God and man. He was more than a human vessel that God filled. He was truly man, but he was also truly God. &gt;&gt; He was the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. His body was not like any other body. For it was a body hast thou prepared me? &gt;&gt; Hebrews 10:5. God created that body for his own dwelling. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus was virgin born. His father God almighty, not Joseph. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Mary was a chosen vessel, but she was not the source. &gt;&gt; She was the incubator. &gt;&gt; The life came from God. The germ of life, the very creative act was divine. &gt;&gt; As Luke says, and he records the angel's announce announcement, the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you about his blood. His blood was not Jewish blood. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. Not gentile blood. &gt;&gt; It wasn't even human blood. It was God himself. &gt;&gt; Paul declared to the elders of Ephesus, "Feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood." &gt;&gt; Amen. Peter said, "We are not redeemed by the blood of a man, nor by corruptible things as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, as a lamb without blemish and without spot. Hallelujah. It is this divine blood, holy, pure, and undefiled, that brings salvation. &gt;&gt; No other blood can save you. &gt;&gt; If his blood had been the blood of a mere man, it could not atone for the sins of the world. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it was the blood of Emanuel. It was God with us. &gt;&gt; That's right. And that's why the prophet Isaiah said in Isaiah 96, "Unto us a child is born. Unto us a son is given and his name shall be called wonderful and counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father, the prince of peace." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are not saved by the blood of Joseph's son. We're not saved by the blood of of Adam's race, but we are saved by the blood of God himself. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you tonight, that blood speaks better things than the blood of Abel. &gt;&gt; Amen. This blood cleanses from our sin. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why tonight, the bride of Christ stands justified, sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But when we're speaking of the messenger, let's never confuse the vessel with the God who filled it. &gt;&gt; God, you know, John was a was a man. Brother Brandham was a man, but Jesus Christ is God. &gt;&gt; And the same spirit that dwelt in him now dwells in the bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. preparing her for &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; So, here's another stone right here that we want to see that was laid in this altar because it's where we come to worship. &gt;&gt; And the restored church knows there is no other name given among men whereby we must be saved. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Salvation is not in titles. It is not in creeds. is not in denominations but it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. From the very beginning apostles baptized every convert in the name of Jesus Christ. On the day of Pentecost, Peter declared, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sin." The Samaritans in Luke 8:16 were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. In Acts 10:48, Cornelius's household was commanded to be baptized in the name of the Lord. In Acts 19:5, Paul rebapt rebaptized the disciples at Ephesus in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And there is no record in the scripture of being baptized any other way. &gt;&gt; That's right. Baptism in his name is not ritual. &gt;&gt; It is an identification. &gt;&gt; Paul declared, "Know you not that so many of us that were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death. Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead, even so we should walk in the newness of life." Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when we are baptized in his name, we publicly identify with his death, his burial, his resurrection. &gt;&gt; By invoking his name, we declare our place in the family &gt;&gt; of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is our family name. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you there is power in that name. &gt;&gt; This name is not just a sound. It carries authority. &gt;&gt; He is Jesus. Jehovah Savior. The angel declared, "Thou shalt call his name Jesus." &gt;&gt; Which means Jehovah Savior, for he will save his people from their sins. I'll tell you tonight, in his name, demons tremble. In his name, sick are healed. In his name, the church prays and they prevail. In his name, the bride is identified as his own. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. The restored church does not compromise on this truth. &gt;&gt; We are baptized in the name above every name. &gt;&gt; The only name by which we under heaven by which we are saved. &gt;&gt; The name that heaven recognized &gt;&gt; that hell fears &gt;&gt; that the bride bears. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ Jehovah our savior. Let me tell you another stone of truth that must be in our altar of worship. &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Not a sensation, &gt;&gt; not a tongue, &gt;&gt; not an emotion, not a chill, not a shout, but the very life of God &gt;&gt; indwelling the believer. Jesus said, "I will come to you." And the Holy Ghost is Christ in you, enabling you to live his word and perform his works. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you of another stone. The security of the believer. &gt;&gt; Not once for this false one saved always saved that excuses sins, but a sealing unto the day of redemption. Hallelujah. The spirit does not come and go. He abides. &gt;&gt; He abides with you forever. &gt;&gt; And the proof that his life governs you and brings you under subjection to his word. And it keeps you walking &gt;&gt; in holiness. &gt;&gt; Let's talk about another real quick. Election and predestination. &gt;&gt; Here's another stone in this altar. Ephesians 1:4 says, "According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride is the offspring of God. &gt;&gt; His very gene expressed in time. &gt;&gt; This unveils eternity itself. says as 1 Timothy 6:16 presents 6:16 presents God as who only hath immortality eternal life belongs to God &gt;&gt; to God alone &gt;&gt; and to those that receive it from him. Therefore, hell cannot be eternal &gt;&gt; otherwise it would make Satan and sin equal with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The fire is eternal, but the destruction of the wicked is complete. For the soul that sinnth, it shall die. &gt;&gt; So here's another stone in our altar of worship. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; today, and forever. that he's here, not in his body, his corporal body of flesh, but in spirit. And he's living in his bride. And the very works that he did, she does. &gt;&gt; The groom and the bride are one. &gt;&gt; That brings us to another stone. The mystery of the bride. &gt;&gt; The wise virgins separated from the foolish. Yeah, &gt;&gt; both are virgins. &gt;&gt; But one has oil and the other does not. &gt;&gt; The wise are taken into the rapture. The foolish go in the tribulation for virgin. &gt;&gt; The bride knows her identity and she's preparing for the marriage supper of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's another stone of truth which is the mystery of iniquity. From the serpent seed in Eden to Satan enthroned is the god to this evil age. Satan too has a bride. She is called mystery Babylon the great, the mother of harlots. &gt;&gt; Amen. He sits in the temple of God, worshiped as God. &gt;&gt; I'm quoting 2 Thessalonians 2:3 and 4. This is the age of deception. &gt;&gt; But it's the day when the man of sin is exposed. &gt;&gt; That's right. for what he is. &gt;&gt; The center of producing &gt;&gt; and you and I tonight because of a restored truth. &gt;&gt; We can trace him all the way from the heavens all the way through Eden all the way to his end in the lake of fire. We can trail that serpent all the way. We can identify his deception through the ages. But I'm telling you, you will not be deceived. You are predestinated to stand in this evil age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you of another stone of truth. The seven church ages and their messengers. &gt;&gt; There are seven stars that are seven messengers to the seven churches as shown in Revelation chapter 1 and 20. These ages span the entire gentile dispensation. The bride has been gathered out of every age culminating in the Leodysian age bringing in the fullness of the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you of another real important stone in our altar of worship. The return of the pillar of fire. The same one who met Moses, sir, &gt;&gt; who struck Paul down and blind on the road to Damascus. He has returned in this last day. &gt;&gt; And he alone, listen to me now, he alone, not theologians, not schools of learning, he alone is the source of all revelation and true understanding. The pillar of fire vindicates the word. He is the revealer of every mystery. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It is the same one who struck Saul down on the road to Damascus and said, "I am Jesus." &gt;&gt; So the pillar of fire is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the author. He knew the book. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why he could reveal it to the messenger. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Brother Brandham's claim was not, "I know all the books well, but I know the author &gt;&gt; real well." &gt;&gt; Here's another one. The seven thunders of Revelation 10. When they sounded, they revealed the mysteries hidden in the seven seals. &gt;&gt; And the prophet declared they were revealed in the seven seals. That's what the thunders was about. You see, this is the food that gives the bride strength for the rapture in faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, let me give you another one. The spirit of Elijah restored. &gt;&gt; For he said, Malachi 4 I5, behold, I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I want you to know this spirit has returned in our generation, &gt;&gt; bringing full restoration. That's right. and full redemption &gt;&gt; turning the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers. &gt;&gt; And I want to say brother Brandon was not merely a five-fold minister. &gt;&gt; No one else had such vindication. &gt;&gt; His gift of discernment was not one of the gifts among nine. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was the ministry of Jesus Christ repeated. It vindicated that he was the seventh angel messenger &gt;&gt; of Revelation 10:7, the promised Elijah to this day. Let me just quote him from the voice of the sign. And he said, "Now we find out these men go out sometimes and then the people begin to press upon them." Oh brother, what will you say? See, if he goes by impression, see the way he feels, why the Lord will do that. Thus say the Lord, that's a lie. You can't say thus sayaeth the Lord &gt;&gt; until God in his own language has spoke to you and told you that and then is not you saying it is not your impression. &gt;&gt; The Bible said if a prophet did that was going on presumptuously and that's presuming and to presume is to venture without authority he's going up on his own. But when you see the man speaking what is going to happen in the name of the Lord and it happens day in and out, week in and out, month in and out, year in and out, then you know that had to come from God. That's God's credentials to the man that he is the interpreter of the written word for that day &gt;&gt; because God sent the man to do it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, these mysteries that have been revealed to us, and I just spoke of, and I'm not necessarily counting each one and say, "Oh, they're one of the 12," but they're the mysteries that have been restored to us that are not detached stones of doctrine. They're the great unveiling of the the once sealed book. &gt;&gt; You see, Isaiah saw it in a vision. Isaiah 29:11, "The vision of all has become to you as the words of a book that is sealed." &gt;&gt; You see, some could not read it because it was sealed. Others could not read it because they were unlearned. The prophets, the rulers, they were all covered in a deep sleep according to Isaiah 29. Yet God promised, "I will proceed to do a marvelous work." the wisdom of their wise men shall perish. And this marvelous work is the opening of the seven seals when the book was unsealed to the bride in this last day. &gt;&gt; You see, with the seals on the book, the the book remained closed. &gt;&gt; But when Christ broke them, the hidden mysteries were open to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I tell you, if you still got one seal left on the book, it's still a closed book. &gt;&gt; But we are feasting from a seven course menu. &gt;&gt; For all the seven seals have been revealed. The book is now open. It's no longer closed. We're not guessing and probing and wondering. &gt;&gt; We're a people of revelation. Amen. Because Christ broke the seals and the mysteries were open to us. &gt;&gt; From the open of the seals came one of the most important sermons of all, &gt;&gt; the supreme token. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham declared it was the highlight of my entire ministry. Every sermon, he said, had been pointing to this. &gt;&gt; Why? Because everything, every mystery, every doctrine, every stone of truth points to the lamb and his blood. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Elijah when he restored the altar on Mount Carmel Carmel, he he did not just lay 12 stones in in order. No, he placed the sacrifice upon them. It was the sacrifice and the fire from heaven that proved that the God of Israel was alive. &gt;&gt; So it is today that that Christ Jesus, the lamb slain, the Holy Ghost, his very life. It must be the center of our worship. &gt;&gt; The token, the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It is not optional. &gt;&gt; It is the focal point of worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True worship cannot revolve around just beautifully laid stones of mystery truths &gt;&gt; that merely impart knowledge to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. The doctrines are necessary. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. But without the lamb, &gt;&gt; without the blood, &gt;&gt; without the Holy Ghost upon them, they are lifeless. You see, the life must flow over every stone. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then the fire falls to vindicate the altar. It consumes the sacrifice. It accepts both the lamb and the stones upon which he is laid. For our God is a consuming fire. &gt;&gt; We must have the fire. &gt;&gt; Did you hear me tonight? We must have the fire. Without the fire, even the altar, think about it, even the altar with this offering will soon become a stench in God's nostrils. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isa Amos 5:21 prophesies, "I hate, I despise your feast days. I will not smell in your solemn assemblies &gt;&gt; because offerings without the fire of the Holy Ghost is rejected." &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. The fire must fall to accept the offering. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It is the spirit that gives life, &gt;&gt; not the form. &gt;&gt; Without the spirit, worship is just empty formality. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; With the spirit, it's a living reality. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I want the spirit. &gt;&gt; I say, let the fire fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got the stones. We have the sacrifice. We have the truth. We have the lamb, but let the fire fall. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Therefore, the restored church must not only gather the stones of truth and place the sacrifice of the lamb. She must also have the fire from heaven. &gt;&gt; Only then is worship complete. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, without the fire, &gt;&gt; Elijah's altar was no different from Baal's. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And without the fire of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; consuming your old life, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Without the fire falling. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your offering is no different from Baales. but to prove it as an altar of Jehovah. The fire falls &gt;&gt; consumes a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We must have the fire from heaven. &gt;&gt; Cuz only then is worship complete. &gt;&gt; Only then is the altar vindicated. &gt;&gt; Only then does God declare his acceptance. For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power. &gt;&gt; That's why we preach restored Bible truths because only when the word and the spirit unite do we see the works of Christ reproduced in our day. &gt;&gt; When a Bible Jesus is preached &gt;&gt; with Bible holiness, &gt;&gt; Amen. and Bible doctrine. That's right. &gt;&gt; Then the fire falls. &gt;&gt; And when the fire falls, sick are healed. Captives are set free. Saints are filled. Amen. That's worship in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; So as the altar is restored as and the fire fell in Elijah's day, I want you to know not only was there fire, but there was rain &gt;&gt; and rain came bringing refreshing &gt;&gt; and restoration. Amen. &gt;&gt; So in the seventh age, a cloud appears in the heavens. Seven mighty angels. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Declaring the time of refreshing had come. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're not waiting on it. &gt;&gt; You are right here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; In the pouring out of God's spirit. &gt;&gt; It is the moment. It's the time. Hosea prophesied of this rain saying his going forth is prepared as a m morning and he shall come to us as the rain and as the latter and former reign. Listen part of his coming &gt;&gt; is the rain. &gt;&gt; You say I want Jesus to come back. Well, he's got to come back first and bring the rain to bring restoration. Hallelujah. Joel echoed it. He prophesied the former and latter rain would fall together. And with that with that with that falling of the rain, that restoration of what had been devoured would be restored. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The result the result you know the result of the rain falling, the flowers shall be full of wheat. &gt;&gt; That's right. And the the the bat shall overflow with wine and oil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that is the result of the rain falling. &gt;&gt; Amen. The floor shall be full of wheat. Look around you. Grain. Grain. Grain. Separated from the shop. Grain. Hallelujah. But with that, is oil. With that is wine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And oil and wine goes together in worship. So there's worship. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When the rain falls, &gt;&gt; everybody's happy. &gt;&gt; The drought is over. &gt;&gt; Smiles on the face, rejoicing, shouting. Look, the rain. This is restoration rain. &gt;&gt; Bringing back the harvest, filling the bride with word and spirit. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the book was sealed and hidden down through the ages. At the seventh seal, the mysteries were opened. The token was revealed as the heart of all worship, Christ's life, the Holy Ghost. The fire falls to consume and vindicate both the lamb and the doctrine. And the fire falls to restore. The rain falls to restore bringing a double portion. Listen now the former and latter rain together. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now as Elijah restored the altar, called the fire and then brought the rain. So in this last day, the spirit of Elijah has restored the word, &gt;&gt; revealed the mysteries, &gt;&gt; and is now bringing the reign of restoration and spirit and power to prepare the bride for her rapture. &gt;&gt; You're not leaving here a defeated bunch of people. &gt;&gt; You're not leaving here cast down and weary and depressed. Now you're going out here a victorious church without a spot wrinkle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So along with the restoration of the altar and its mystery truth, Elijah brings the rain. &gt;&gt; First Kings 18:43. and and he said unto his servant, "Go up now and look toward the sea." And he went up and looked, and he said, "There's nothing." He said, "Go again seven times." &gt;&gt; And it came to pass, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; at the seventh time, &gt;&gt; that he said, "Behold, there arises a little cloud out of the sea, &gt;&gt; like a man's hand." And he said, "Go up, say to Ahab, prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stopped thee not." And it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heavens were black with the clouds and the wind, and there was a great rain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to preach. &gt;&gt; All of that was preliminary. Look at the parallel just for a moment. In the seventh time, in the seventh age, it came out as a cloud, a sign in the heavens with seven angels. &gt;&gt; Hosea 6 and3 said, "If we follow on to know the Lord, oh that we might know the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let us press on to know him, his coming, his going forth is prepared as the morning." Amen. And he shall come on &gt;&gt; unto us as the rain, the former, the latter and former reign unto the earth. &gt;&gt; His coming &gt;&gt; will be as the rain. &gt;&gt; Joel said, "Be glad then, you children of Zion." In 2:23, and rejoice in the Lord your God, for he has given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month. And the floor shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil. And I will restore to you the years that the locust is eaten. The canker worm, the caterpillar, the the palm of worm. My great army I sent among you, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham. In resurrection of Jesus Christ, he said, "Do you know the scriptures must be fil fulfilled?" God has to appear in this last day to do the things he's doing now. It's to fulfill the scripture. And it shall come to pass in the last days I will pour out my spirit. And remember he said there would be a former reign and a latter rain. And in the latter rain both the former and latter rain would come together a double portion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then if we see what the former rain produce, how much more would the latter rain produce? And when he pours out his spirit, there will be signs and wonders take place. I was speaking not long ago. When omnipotent speaks, miracles happen. It has to. &gt;&gt; So, shouldn't we see the cloud of the latter rain? &gt;&gt; Amen. John wrote, "Behold, he cometh with clouds." &gt;&gt; Hosea said, "His coming would be as the former and latter rain." Zachchariah spoke of bright clouds of the latter rain. In our day, we've seen the cloud of his appearing. &gt;&gt; Not a natural vapor, &gt;&gt; but a supernatural sign in the heavens, &gt;&gt; a cloud formed by seven angels, declaring the seals are open, &gt;&gt; that redemption is complete, and that the headstone Christ himself was descending to unite with his body, the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And let me tell you, everywhere that that clouds, that cloud spreads, it brings rain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when it rains, it restores. &gt;&gt; What was dead and dry springs back to life. &gt;&gt; Dead grass turns green. Dead trees puts forth new branches. Lays begin to clap their hands. The breeze of the spirit begins to blow. Hallelujah. Why? The rain has fallen. And when it rains, it restores you. It refreshes you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at men and women today who were once dead in sins and trespasses, but the rain of his spirit, he rained on you and he brought you life. Some of you were old in an old cold dead dark tomb somewhere of religion. But the rain &gt;&gt; resurrected you to life. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what it is. It's the rushing mighty wind of the Holy Ghost. It's a cloud of seven angels. It's showing the fullness of redemption. It makes up the head of Christ. It is Christ revealing himself from heaven &gt;&gt; in these last days. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, this is no ordinary rain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is both the teaching rain and the harvest rain. It is the latter rain that brings forth the ripen fruit. Amen. Producing a word bride &gt;&gt; in this last day. &gt;&gt; This is a time of restoration. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we know God sent one in the spirit and the power of Elijah. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; What was to do? To turn the hearts of the children back to the faith. &gt;&gt; The Elijah anointing is the spirit of Christ himself. &gt;&gt; It's given five different times for different works of restoration. &gt;&gt; Let's talk about that just briefly. Elijah, we know we read about he restores the altar of the Lord in Israel. He turns the hearts from Baal to Jehovah. Elisha will continue with the double portion showing the continuation of the same spirit. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist came in the spirit of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children to the apostles to Jesus preparing the way for Christ. Malachi 4, uh, Elijah comes to the the Gentiles in the last day, turning the hearts of the children in back to the apostolic fathers. &gt;&gt; The fifth coming of Elijah will be in the tribulation, joined with the spirit of Moses, pointing the 144,000 Jews back to the original atonement. &gt;&gt; And there will not be another there will never be another Elijah to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; That's right. The one man scriptures and prophecies have been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; One man ministries are over. &gt;&gt; It is now a body ministry. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I I know. I know. I there's been many already that stood up to claim they've already taken brother Brandon's place and claims his mantel. &gt;&gt; That's because impersonators just like Janice and Jambers &gt;&gt; withtood Moses &gt;&gt; because this is an age where impersonators are prevalent. &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham went forth after the angel's visitation in 1946, there were hundreds &gt;&gt; hundreds went up rose up with their own healing campaigns. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, when the seals were opened, many others rose up with personal revelations, &gt;&gt; drawing people after themselves. &gt;&gt; But the true spirit of Elijah never points to a man. &gt;&gt; It always points back to Christ, the word. &gt;&gt; Now, some of you will wonder, maybe you're new here tonight, and you wonder, well, why why do we need Elijah? Because it's like in the book of Judges, every man did what was right in his own eyes. &gt;&gt; And without the spirit of Elijah, that's exactly where we return back to confusion, speculation, and private revelation or interpretation. &gt;&gt; And Peter said, "No prophecy of the scripture is of any private &gt;&gt; interpretation." &gt;&gt; So why is it that Gentiles must receive Elijah? Because like Israel, the gentile church in these past seven ages &gt;&gt; have forsaken the true altar of worship. &gt;&gt; And they have served even a trinity of gods. &gt;&gt; And the Elijah ministry is to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers. &gt;&gt; And you see the church was originally founded on Jesus Christ. He was the chief cornerstone. &gt;&gt; But Paul warned of another Jesus &gt;&gt; and another gospel. &gt;&gt; And today we see 40,000 denominations, &gt;&gt; the proof of corruption and splintering. &gt;&gt; You know, and I just say, which sect out there has repented? &gt;&gt; None of them. &gt;&gt; Denominations. Those ideas of man are a curse and beyond redemption. This is why God had to send Elijah not to reform but to restore. &gt;&gt; And Elijah today has gathered the apostolic truths that was scattered by theology. He's rebuilt the altar. It was vindicated with a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; The opening of the seals revealed and restored hidden truths. And the highlight of his ministry was the sup the supernatural supreme token Christ life the Holy Ghost applied to the believer. &gt;&gt; And without the token the altar is lifeless stones. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With it the fire falls. &gt;&gt; And if you reject Elijah where's your fire? Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, Paul's gospel was not word only but &gt;&gt; but power and demonstration. &gt;&gt; And a diplomas from a seminary is not vindication. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Theology taught by religious schools is not vindication. &gt;&gt; The fire of God is vindication. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Without Elijah, you're only left with another Jesus, &gt;&gt; another gospel. &gt;&gt; With Ana, you know, Anathema, without Elijah, we're Rome again. &gt;&gt; Rect reject Elijah, you're just another sect. &gt;&gt; It's your choice. &gt;&gt; It's your choice. Rejection, you're just another sect. &gt;&gt; You're going to be a sect. Well, why don't you just join Rome &gt;&gt; because they're the oldest and strongest, just go on back to your mother. &gt;&gt; But if you want vindication, &gt;&gt; you need a God who answers by fire. The God of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The spirit of Elijah has come. The altar has been revealed. The fire is fallen. The token is here for without it we are cursed. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But with it &gt;&gt; we are the manifested sons of God ready for a rapture. Yet in the pattern of Elijah and Elisha, there still is the passing of the mantle. &gt;&gt; The you see the Bible said, "So he departed thence and found Elisha. And Elijah passed by him and cast his mantel &gt;&gt; upon him. The mantle was the prophet's outer garment. &gt;&gt; It represented the anointing that enveloped him, the the authority of his commission, the spirit that clothed him for his work. When Elisha took up Elijah's mantle, he took up his assignment, his duties, and his work. And what of the bride today she too has been called and chosen ordained for a specific commission. &gt;&gt; The mantle of this message is not a human spirit. &gt;&gt; It is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; The very life of Christ resting on the bride to fulfill her role &gt;&gt; in the plan of redemption. And her assignment is clear to fulfill every word &gt;&gt; that has been spoken of a bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She is the final voice &gt;&gt; to the final age. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She is anointed to manifest the scriptures that pertain to the bride &gt;&gt; to live out the very prophecies that were written of her before the foundation of the world. And just as Elisha was under Elijah's anointing, so are we. Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit of Elijah now rest &gt;&gt; on the bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And just as Elisha typed the bride, we too have been called by name. &gt;&gt; We have been ordained to this position. &gt;&gt; We have been summoned and called out of the world by God himself. And we've been clothed with his mantel. &gt;&gt; Don't we realize as Elisha types the bride that we too have been called by name. We have been ordained for this position. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We have been called out by God. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you Elisha is then he doggedly he he follows that prophet. Wherever he goes, Elisha goes. &gt;&gt; It's important to follow the messenger everywhere he goes. Amen. Elisha had to keep his eyes on Elijah &gt;&gt; to receive the double portion. &gt;&gt; And so must the church follow Jesus &gt;&gt; to receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You must follow Jesus every day. &gt;&gt; Or you take on an organizational life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Elisha had to follow. &gt;&gt; The Christian walk is a journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't remain in one place. &gt;&gt; You can't stand still &gt;&gt; and still receive the double portion of the spirit &gt;&gt; and truth. &gt;&gt; You You have to do the same as Elisha. You got to keep following. Every individual comes through the journey just like Elisha did. And just as the church has advancing from Luther to Wesley to Isuza Street to the fullness of the word and the spirit, the you see this Elijah Elisha narrative is used to typify different periods in in church history. Brother Brandham used it like this. Elisha following Elijah to Gilgal represents the church coming out of dark ages. Elisha following Elijah to Bethl represents the second stage of the journey John Wesley's age. You see Elisha following Elijah to Jericho represents the third state of the journey which is the Isuza street Pentecostal age and finally Elisha crossing the Jordan after re you know after receiving a double portion of Elijah's spirit represents the next stage for the church which is a time of the fullness of the word and its supernatural power and I want to tell you We have now entered into that final stage. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, don't we realize that Elisha types the bride? We too have been called by name. &gt;&gt; We're not here by accident. &gt;&gt; We have been ordained for this position. &gt;&gt; We have been handpicked by God himself. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You didn't choose me. I chose you. I've ordained you." Paul said whom he did forno him he also did predestinate moreover whom he predestinate he also called &gt;&gt; you know like Elisha we were out plowing in our fields &gt;&gt; we were busy with the ordinary task of life &gt;&gt; but when Elijah came by &gt;&gt; and he cast his mantel over us &gt;&gt; that mantel was not our choosing. &gt;&gt; We did not run after it. We did not purchase it. We did not deserve it. It was a sovereign choice of God. &gt;&gt; He chose you. &gt;&gt; And when that mantel touched Elisha, everything changed. &gt;&gt; He left his oxen and he sacrificed them on the fire. He kissed his family goodbye. He followed the prophet of God. That mantle meant new life. It meant new direction. It meant a new destiny. &gt;&gt; I was destined for hell. But one day, the battle was thrown over me. It turned my life around. It changed my direction. It gave me a new destiny. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So is it with the bride &gt;&gt; when God's calling upon us. We could not stay in our old fields. &gt;&gt; We left the world in sin. &gt;&gt; We left it all behind. We departed man-made religions. &gt;&gt; We laid down our own ambitions. We begin to follow the word for our day and we're not looking back &gt;&gt; cuz no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God. We're not looking back. &gt;&gt; This calling begins a journey following Elijah &gt;&gt; which is following the prophetic word of the day. That's right. &gt;&gt; Elisha couldn't chart his own course. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He had to stay with the prophet. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever he went &gt;&gt; through Gilgal, Bethl, Jericho, Jordan, he had to follow. &gt;&gt; So is it with the bride. &gt;&gt; We must follow in every stage. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, there there's Gilgal, which is justification, where we learn that the Lord is our provision for sin, therefore our righteousness. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, many denominations camp there and still live at Gilgal. &gt;&gt; But those who stay at Gilgal can never get the double portion. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sanctification. Bethl, meaning the house of God is where we prepare ourselves through sanctification. We're cleansed in preparation to becoming the dwelling place of God. &gt;&gt; And there's many of them built their denomination. at Bethl &gt;&gt; and they've stayed there. &gt;&gt; But if you stay at Bethl, you can never get the double portion. &gt;&gt; And then there's the baptism of the Holy Ghost, Jericho, at the school of prophets, where gifts of the spirit are given. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's a wonderful place, &gt;&gt; but you can't stay in Jericho. Because you see, you've got to go across Jordan &gt;&gt; into the fullness of the word where we completely die to ourselves. Sin nature's dead &gt;&gt; and we cross Jordan where we rise with his life and where we walk in the double portion where the book the land is open. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Come on. &gt;&gt; Now, in the sermon of the paradox, brother Brandham tells of a vision coming down through coming and he saw himself coming down on the map of Palestine. And he noted he had come twothirds of the way to Jordan, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And and and he said, "And I looked across Jordan and I said, "Oh, praise God. Just on the other side is where all the promises laid. Every promise lays in the promised land. &gt;&gt; Now, at the end of the sermon, he explains its meaning and he said, "Now you see what coming down to Jordan meant. We're down here now. Let us cross over. Let's quit playing. Let's cross uh the other side now because it all belongs to it. It's all ours. Them visions never fail. They can't fail because they come from God. I believe it is all within me. We are not the hierland that will run back into the wilderness. We will cross Jordan the separation. God, break to us the seals that's on the back of the book. Let us enter into this great place now. For Joshua divided to the people their inheritance &gt;&gt; that God had left for them. So crossing the Jordan means returning back to the land of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Coming back to its doctrines, is truth to the fullness of the spirit. &gt;&gt; And to do this, the seals must be open. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For that opens to us the complete inheritance. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, each step requires faithfulness. Each test requires determination. &gt;&gt; But like Elisha the bride cries, "As the Lord liveth and my soul liveth, I will not leave thee." &gt;&gt; We didn't choose this anointing. &gt;&gt; We were chosen by God. And because he chose us, &gt;&gt; we will follow &gt;&gt; through every trial, through every stage, through every Jordan. We will not turn back. For the same God who laid the mantle upon us has promised a double portion &gt;&gt; of his spirit. &gt;&gt; Now Elisha followed Elijah. He followed with relentless determination. &gt;&gt; Wherever the prophet went, Ali Elisha went because he knew in order to receive the double portion, he had to keep his eyes on the messenger. In the same way, the church must keep our eyes on Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; You see, Elisha's journey was not stationary. It was progressive. &gt;&gt; There's some of you who have remained too long in one place. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God may have brought you to that place. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he calls you to go further. &gt;&gt; And every step is a test. carry here. I pray thee. It's the test. &gt;&gt; Well, this was good enough for my granddaddy. My granddaddy, my grandmother were here. You're going to have to realize when the prophet leaves Gilgal, &gt;&gt; you leave Gilgal. &gt;&gt; Amen. God may have brought you to forgiveness of sin, but he wants to sanctify you of all of those habits in your life. You got to answer. As the Lord liveth and my soul liveth, &gt;&gt; I will not leave thee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the church has advanced in stages. Now let's talk about the church. Gilgal justification through Martin Luther. Revelation just shall live by faith. Bethl sanctification through John Wesley the cleansing of the heart. The call to holy living. Jericho, &gt;&gt; uh, Pentecost and Isuza Street, &gt;&gt; where sons of the prophets are with a baptism of the Holy Ghost bringing its anointing, gifts of the spirit, and signs following. And Jericho is on the edge of Jordan, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And there you can speak in genuine tongues and still be lost. Come on. &gt;&gt; You can have that baptism every day of your life and go to hell. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You cannot stay at Jericho. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Elijah left Isuza Street behind. And so have we. &gt;&gt; I said so have we. We have went across Jordan &gt;&gt; into the supernatural age. &gt;&gt; The fullness of the word united with the fullness of the spirit and we have received the token the literal life of Christ producing a bride in his very image. &gt;&gt; This is the adoption that places you in the land. It places you in the inheritance. &gt;&gt; As brother Bradam said, now we have the token in this day. We've been given a token which is an antitype of that type of that natural token. We have been given the supernatural supreme token. And all that was for shattered and given this generation has been given the token. Now we have the Holy Ghost is our token and it is our identification that we have accepted the death of the lamb and not only was Jesus's a human life to come back upon us but it was God himself manifested in the flesh that brought back upon us the adoption of sons that now we are the sons and daughters of God. That is the token. &gt;&gt; It's the identification of our Passover. It is our identification. We have believed God and God has accepted. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now you cannot remain at any stage, &gt;&gt; justification, sanctification, even the Pentecostal anointing is not the goal. That's right. [Music] &gt;&gt; With the school of prophets, with his prophecies, with his tongues and interpretation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Elisha had to follow Elijah, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And go all the way across Jordan. &gt;&gt; Come on. Where the seals are off the book. &gt;&gt; To receive the double portion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, let me just tell you, in this land across Jordan is justification. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; In this land, we're still sanctified. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In this land, there's still gifts of the spirit. &gt;&gt; But in this land is more than gifts or justification or sanctification. It's the fullness of the word. It's the power of God. Hallelujah. Amen. And we have to follow Elijah to proceed the double portion. Press into the fullness of Christ that you might be filled with all the fullness of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And receive the token. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just stop for a little bit, slow down just a second, bring out a couple of important points. This journey is not a group salvation. &gt;&gt; It's an individual walk. &gt;&gt; Elisha was tested at every stop, but he refused to let go. And so must we hunger and thirst for righteousness and you shall be filled. Don't stop at Gilgal where you only know forgiveness. And I want to say forgiveness is wonderful. &gt;&gt; But justification is more. &gt;&gt; It declares you righteous. &gt;&gt; Exchanging your sin for Christ's righteousness. &gt;&gt; If you've been justified by faith, Amen. You have exchanged your sins for God's righteousness. &gt;&gt; But let me don't stop there and don't go on to Bethl, but don't stop at Bethl where sanctification cleanses you from habits and sets you apart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Without the new nature of the Holy Ghost, you will go back like a dog to its vomit &gt;&gt; or to a hog to its swallow. Sanctification alone will not hold you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, brother Tim, I I God God took pornography from me. I great wonderful. He took tobacco. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He I quit drinking. Amen. But don't stop there. That's right. &gt;&gt; And don't stop at Jericho, the school of the prophets, &gt;&gt; where men ordained themselves &gt;&gt; and organizations claim to be the place of worship. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, belonging to a fellowship has its merits, but God ain't taking groups and sects and cults and the rapture. It's an individual affair. Oh, that's where many people stop and make their schools. But let me tell you, brother Brandham said is not a group. It is a personal vindication of an impregnated child of God filled with the Holy Ghost. So surrendered to God, he don't care anything about anything else. And the Holy Spirit living its life, pulsating through him, showing the personal vindication of the word itself, expressing itself to the people and to the world. Now, I want to I want to just take a minute because many preachers will begin their ministries in humility. &gt;&gt; And like Saul, when thou was little in thine own sight, &gt;&gt; they walked with God and they were teachable. But when power, recognition, or following is given, they build a throne. &gt;&gt; They build a kingdom in their hearts. And soon exaltation takes place takes the place of humility. &gt;&gt; And this was the fall of Lucifer from the beginning that thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty. Thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness. &gt;&gt; You see, God gives positions, but he doesn't give the Holy Spirit that often comes with them. Pride is man's corruption, &gt;&gt; not God's anointing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And Paul warned that. He said, "But the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, &gt;&gt; but after their own lust shall heed to themselves teaching because they have itching ears." Instead of seeking God through prayer and leadership of the Holy Ghost, then carnal men lean upon human leaders. And this spirit then exalts ministers until they become overlords, &gt;&gt; bishops, &gt;&gt; and even kings in their own mind. &gt;&gt; And their church or their ministry becomes the Jerusalem, &gt;&gt; the supposed the supposed place for worship and for salvation. And in their pride, they present themselves as God's chosen place of worship. But in such system you see the offspring of the church is no longer the seed of God born of the word of the spirit becomes seed of man &gt;&gt; human converts to a human system &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; I I I don't want you your disciplehip &gt;&gt; I I don't want listen to me I I don't want my own offspring &gt;&gt; amen I want to present to Christ a chase virgin That's right. &gt;&gt; An undefiled church. &gt;&gt; And Paul himself, you know, he carried a great authority. But notice his words. They glorified God in me. He never drew men to himself. He never presented himself. And his ministry is the only door to salvation. &gt;&gt; His commission was to point people to Christ alone. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. Yet the clergy of every age has sought divine leadership plus human control and thus given honor where honor is not due. They spot the church with humanism and they elevate men instead of exalting Christ. &gt;&gt; And I want to say Jesus, not my church, not full gospel lighthouse. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is God's chosen place of worship. Not Rome, not Jerusalem, not a denomination, not a ministry, not a headquarters, not Jeffersonville. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man cometh the Father but by me." &gt;&gt; Salvation is in his name alone. For neither is there salvation any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. &gt;&gt; So we must never glory in men but in the Lord. God's chosen place of worship is not man. It's not a movement. It's not a system. is in Jesus himself, &gt;&gt; the lamb of God who alone can redeem us by his blood. &gt;&gt; Now, now notice, you see the bride's call. Elisha would not leave. Wow, you're running out of time. Now Elisha would not leave Elijah's side. Even so the bride will not leave the word. &gt;&gt; She has a holy determination as the Lord liveth. &gt;&gt; And my soul liveth, &gt;&gt; I will not leave thee. &gt;&gt; That's what he's looking for. Thirdbred Christians, men and women whose nature have been changed by the Holy Ghost, who bear the life of the lamb, not just the form of religion. &gt;&gt; The bride has one assignment, that is to fulfill every word spoken of her. Now, so we must press on, go through every stage until the double portion falls. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let us fix our eyes on Jesus, not turn aside this hunger and thirst. Amen. And until we receive more than an anointing, &gt;&gt; till we're filled with the spirit, &gt;&gt; the literal life of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, but again, as we look at this, you see this brings us now to the Jericho stage, which is spirit without life. Here are many sons of the prophets at Jericho. &gt;&gt; Here they gather. It's a type of the Pentecostal revival. At Isuza's tree, the spirit fell with mighty signs, tongues, prophecies, miracles, and many stopped there &gt;&gt; content with an anointing upon the spirit while their soul remained unchanged. &gt;&gt; Think of it. Men who were alcoholics, even drunk in the pullpit, could pray for the sick &gt;&gt; and get results. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aa Allen was a striking example. Anointed use, but bound in personal failures. This proves that gifts and anointings are no substitute &gt;&gt; for token life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; For gifts and callings are without repentance. &gt;&gt; That's right. You can shout, &gt;&gt; you can jump, &gt;&gt; you can prophesy &gt;&gt; and still live a defeated life. &gt;&gt; Pentecost brought the church to Jordan's edge. But the church must go &gt;&gt; across Jordan. &gt;&gt; And crossing Jordan means more than gifts &gt;&gt; and blessings. It means death to self and resurrection to life. On the outer side of Jordan lays every promise of God, the land flowing with milk and honey. &gt;&gt; But that's not found in the church. It's not just f it's not found in church excitement and knowledge, but in full union with Christ. &gt;&gt; And that's where token life begins. the literal life of Christ indwelling, governing, sealing, empowering the believer where you are crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, you live. &gt;&gt; Because yet it's not I but Christ liveth in me. &gt;&gt; It's not just an anointing that touches and excites your spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. It It's the Holy Ghost coming into your soul, abiding forever. Jesus said he'll give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So don't stop at Jericho. &gt;&gt; Don't settle for gifts without the giver. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't rest at the shout &gt;&gt; when God's calling you to the token. There you go. &gt;&gt; Just as Israel had to cross Jordan to possess her inheritance, so the bride must cross into the full possession of the promised word, the Holy Ghost is the token, the blood applied, the life of Christ himself. And without it, all else is incomplete. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be content with fragments, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Or with men having preeminence. So let's not stay at Gilgal. &gt;&gt; Let's don't stop at Bethl. &gt;&gt; Let's don't stop at Jericho, but cross into the fullness of the spirit, the token life of Jesus Christ and his bride. As brother Brandham note the title were I think Pentecost failed. &gt;&gt; So where did they fail? &gt;&gt; And he said oh my the people who claim to be filled with the Holy Ghost is afraid to trust God for two things. brother cross Jordan, get on the other side. The portion, double portion of the Holy Spirit that was upon Christ was sent back to the church to minister and carry on the work until he come. Little bit while the world seeth me no more, and you shall see me, for I will a personal pronoun will be with you even to the end of the world. He's raised from the dead and is with the church tonight in spiritual form, giving you every bit of the powers he had upon him here upon the earth is handed over to the church to use and you're afraid to use it. I wonder &gt;&gt; if you have took that last step. Have you really crossed Jordan? But let me tell you, I want to assure you the token is attainable. &gt;&gt; Why in the world would God command us to preach the token the Holy Ghost and that it's more than a baptism, a dip, a portion, but the indwelling life of Christ if it was something unattainable? &gt;&gt; It is not a dream. It is not a myth. It's the promised land for the believer. &gt;&gt; That Paul said, "Be filled with the spirit." &gt;&gt; The token is not something optional. It is the ticket for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Without it, you ain't going. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just correct a couple of things here because many people say, "Well, we receive the spirit when we believe the message. You know, Baptists al often reason that way, &gt;&gt; but believing isn't receiving. &gt;&gt; Even brother Brandham said, "You say, "I believe the message, Brother Brandham." He said, "That's fine, but you must have the token." &gt;&gt; Well, I believe you, brother Brandham. He said, "That's only being able to read." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so believing is not receiving. See, justification is a work of the spirit. that declares you righteous by faith in Christ. Sanctification is a cleansing from the works of the flesh. A baptism of the spirit is an anointing that brings gifts of the spirit. But the token is the Holy Ghost himself and is God's own life entering to the believer. When Paul asked at Ephesus, have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? You see, believe brought them sal to salvation, but they still needed to receive the spirit. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now, that's where a lot of people stop. Well, I I I believe the message. I I I see all the mystery truths. I've got it all in my altar of worship. Now, look at Samaria. In in Acts chapter 8, the story of Philip preach preaching at at Samaria. There were miracles happened. There were demons that fled. Healings broke forth. People believed the message. They were even baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Even Simon the sorcerer believed and was baptized. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But notice though they had believed and were baptized, the Bible said in Acts 8:16, "As yet he, the Holy Ghost was fallen upon none of them." &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; They had believed and even had correct water baptism. &gt;&gt; And didn't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, even Simon the sorcerer believed. &gt;&gt; Simon was baptized. And yet, Peter discerned his heart was not right before God. He said, "Thy heart is not right in the sight of God. Repent. Therefore, &gt;&gt; you see this proves belief and water baptism alone is not enough. &gt;&gt; The token must come. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But I believe I believe, brother Tim, I profess Jesus is the Christ. I I believe the message. I I believe it is true. I've been baptized. You have to have the token. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this has been our great failure. &gt;&gt; Isn't this where most of our much of our mission work falls short? Isn't this the reason there's so many problems in our churches? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Isn't this why that churches &gt;&gt; actually become a gather, a cage &gt;&gt; of every unclean and hateful bird? Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Sin setting in message &gt;&gt; pews. &gt;&gt; Isn't that why we have members in our church who think they are saved and are still sinners? &gt;&gt; We baptize multitudes in water. &gt;&gt; But how many truly receive the Holy Ghost? Without the token, they remain unsealed. &gt;&gt; You see, Paul wrote in Ephesians 1:13, "After that you believe, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise." The spirit comes after believing, &gt;&gt; not before. &gt;&gt; You see, and let me tell you, the call is to go the way all the way. The token is not is not just emotion. It's more than emotion. It's more It's even more than a baptism or anointing coming upon you and you're blessed as Isuza had. The token is more than a work of the spirit of sanctification or justification. It is the literal life of Jesus Christ coming into you, changing your nature and sealing you forever. That's why we press beyond Gilgal &gt;&gt; justification, beyond Bethl sanctification where I cleaned up and quit my vices of drugs and alcohol and tobacco and I now have a new uniform and dress holy and I put off my makeup and quit cutting my hair and all of these other things. It's beyond that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad you came there. &gt;&gt; You followed the prophet there. &gt;&gt; It's a good place to come, &gt;&gt; but don't stay there. &gt;&gt; Oh, but brother Chim, I got under the anointing and I jumped in the pew and I shouted when they sang and I felt the spirit and I had chills come running all over me. But if your life ain't changed, If you save the same old sinner that you was when you come in, let me tell you, you need the token life. &gt;&gt; You need the Holy Ghost. You need to cross Jordan. You need to die to that old self &gt;&gt; and cross over Jordan. go into the fullness of token life where God dwells in the soul and his nature takes over because on the other side of Jordan every promise lays &gt;&gt; life power and the rapture itself. &gt;&gt; So let's don't stop at believing. &gt;&gt; Let us don't stop at baptism. &gt;&gt; Let's don't stop at the shout and the dance. Let's press on to the token comes. &gt;&gt; Until the spirit has healed us, until Christ lives in us. Hallelujah. Till you can say, "It ain't me that lives anymore. It ain't me that overcomes. It ain't me that's trying. It's Christ living in me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Without the token, we can't go in the rapture. But with that with with the token, nothing can hold us back. No sin, no power of darkness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. There is no river that ain't crossable &gt;&gt; with the token. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, we're living in the Sodom age. The Bible said in Luke 17:30, we're in the day when the son of man is being revealed. This takes place before the burning of Sodom, right in the midst of the Sodomite age. You look around us and the same conditions that marked Sodom marks our day. &gt;&gt; And this very hour, Jesus said the Son of Man would be revealed again. Now what is the son of man? Now Jesus didn't say the son of god or the son of David in this prophecy. He said son of man. &gt;&gt; Now this is not a different person &gt;&gt; but a different ministry. &gt;&gt; It is the ministry of Jesus Christ himself. It is the word unveiled in the last days. When Jesus walked the earth, the son of man ministry was the word made flesh. He discerned the thoughts, the intents of the heart. He healed the sick. He opened blind eyes. He manifested the very nature of God in human flesh. &gt;&gt; But the son of man ministry is more than signs and wonders. Right? &gt;&gt; It is the very life of and nature of Christ returning to a bride people uniting her with the word until she and he are one. &gt;&gt; Now that's what this tok Holy Ghost token is truly for. Is is not an anointing that comes and goes. is not merely a gift, &gt;&gt; but it's the life of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; indwelling his bride, &gt;&gt; Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just tell you the difference of it. You see, you know, you'll get blessed in church and you'll feel the power of God. That's the anointing. That's right. &gt;&gt; But when you walk out of here, &gt;&gt; that leaves. &gt;&gt; Maybe tomorrow it's gone. &gt;&gt; Maybe trouble comes, it's all gone. That becomes a memory. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something. The token is not a baptism. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The token is indwelling life. &gt;&gt; And when you leave from here, the token goes with you. &gt;&gt; And when you're in bad times, the token is there. And when you're presented with sin, the token is there to overcome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the life of Christ in you. It never leaves you. &gt;&gt; The anointing comes and goes, &gt;&gt; but the spirit of the token abides with you forever. [Applause] And the son of man ministry in this hour is Christ expressing himself again not in one individual body of flesh but in his bride body around the world. The word has returned in his fullness and the bride receives that word until she becomes its living manifestation. Now this is the age of Luke 17:30. The son of man's revealed. It's not just miracles. is not just discernment, but it's the very nature of Christ returned to anoint his bride, making her bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. This is the token life. The bride united with the bridegroom, the word and the spirit made flesh again. Now, brother brother Brandham said, you know, that that that you know, and and there's a there's a lot of quotes that I could read right here, but let me just tell you. He said, he said, I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh through the bride's body. Right. &gt;&gt; So this is where the son of man &gt;&gt; the ministry and life of Christ &gt;&gt; is on display &gt;&gt; and is living in a people. &gt;&gt; It is Christ revealed in the form of son of man &gt;&gt; through the bride's body. &gt;&gt; Listen as brother Brandon said in spoken words original seed as these end time prophecies will repeat. I believe as the first forerunner came from the wilderness and cried, "Behold the lamb of God, the second forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a wordborn bride." &gt;&gt; He says again, now watch now and this is God's provided place of worship. 1965 the bride the church will come through justification through Luther through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Pentecost and go right on into the perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the same selfersons. God will be so manifested into his bride in his church till they will both be the same. They are one. Now you see where we're at. &gt;&gt; We're right here in the perfection of the son of man. &gt;&gt; The life of Christ on display in a bride. &gt;&gt; The token his literal life &gt;&gt; on display. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, so you see we we have come now right now to to to through through all these things. We've come justification to Martin Luther, sanctification through John Wesley, baptism of the Holy Ghost through Pentecost, restoring of gifts. But it didn't stop there. The church must move on into perfection. The perfection of the son of man. What does it mean? It is not only the continuation of Christ's ministry, but it's completion in a bride. &gt;&gt; What he started in groom form, he's going to finish &gt;&gt; in bride form. &gt;&gt; What was manifested in the groom, Jesus Christ, must be manifested in his bride. That's right. &gt;&gt; So he said at that day you shall know that I'm in the father and you and me and I in you. We are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones. That's what Paul said. The husband and wife becomes one person. The same life, same nature, same word expressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. The son of man is the ministry of Christ revealed at the end time in his first body, the groom. He discerned the thoughts. He healed the sick. He revealed the word. But now in his bride body, the same ministry comes to perfection. &gt;&gt; Not in one man alone, but in a multi-membered body &gt;&gt; across the earth. &gt;&gt; And this marries or unites the bride and Christ together. It makes the bride in union with Christ. &gt;&gt; And this is not a doctrine. It's a mystery union. The bride is not separate from him. She is him. She's bone of his bone. She's flesh of his flesh. What the groom did in his earthly ministry, the bride will do in the end time ministry. The works that I do shall you do also. Amen. Till we all come to the unity of the faith of the perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is where we stand now. right at the threshold of the bride and the bridegroom being manifested as the same self person. Christ in his church finishing what he began and preparing a bride for the rapture. &gt;&gt; So you see we're not just Luther or Wesley or Isuz of Pentecost but the son of man revealed Christ revealed in his perfection. &gt;&gt; The bride and the groom are one. the life, the word, the same spirit. You see, it's the hour of union. It is now, you know, is now where he expresses himself in his godhead deity through his church. Have preeminence in this church. The anointed man now the anointed people. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. To bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom. You see, it's the life of Jesus that must be in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is him. It's him working in your life. &gt;&gt; Now, this is the bride coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Elijah is gone. &gt;&gt; But the spirit of Elijah is still anointing Elisha. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not his human spirit &gt;&gt; but the spirit of Christ that was associated with Elijah. Remember this Elijah and Elisha always is a type of Christ the church with a double portion. Now let let me just you know go through what is the double portion brother. I went through it every time where brother Brandon mentioned and I just made a whole list of them. And the double portion is the same baptism Jesus had. The double portion is Mark 16. These signs have shall follow them that believe. &gt;&gt; The double portion is John 14:12. The things that I do, so you do also, and greater &gt;&gt; double portion, more of it. Double portion. The greater works is the third pull, the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Double portion. Former and latter reign. &gt;&gt; The double portion is the spiritual resurrection. where we cross Jordan. That's the earnest one portion. And then the physical resurrection where the saints cross back over Jordan representing the change of our bodies. &gt;&gt; So I want you to see the double portion. If you get one portion, you're going to get the other portion. If you cross Jordan, come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. and you were born again filled with the token, you're going to come up with resurrection power. &gt;&gt; Amen. The resurrection and body change lies in the double portion. Don't you want it? &gt;&gt; Well, with the token, the genuine Holy Ghost, you have the guarantee of the body change. It is the earnest of the inheritance that if you got this portion, you will get the other portion. &gt;&gt; If you got the token, you're also going to be resurrected. Your bodies are going to be changed. You'll be among those alive and remain at the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Elijah said, You asked for a hard thing. You asked for a double portion. Now, not because it was hard for God. Not because it was hard for Elijah. The difficulty was for Elisha. Because to receive the double portion means he will now bear the responsibility of the mantle. He will be the one commissioned to carry forward the work. &gt;&gt; So you see there there has to be and and and Elijah said, "Well, I'll tell you what. If you see me when I'm taken from thee, it shall be given to you." &gt;&gt; But here's the prerequisite to get the double portion. You got to see me. If thou see me when I'm taken from thee, it shall be so to thee. So Elisha had to watch with unwavering focus. &gt;&gt; And when the chariot of fire carried Elijah away, Elisha cried, "My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof, and the prophet was gone, but the spirit remained." So Elisha picked up the fallen mantel. He smoked the waters of Jordan. He cried, "Where is the God of Elijah?" &gt;&gt; And the waters parted, proving that the same God was still present, still working, still anointed. &gt;&gt; Now, let me bring it home. The parallel for us. Yeah. Elijah was taken away, but the spirit is still here. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus ascended into heaven, but he said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you." His spirit is still here. &gt;&gt; Yes, the apostles died 2,000 years ago, but the same Holy Ghost still anoints the bride. &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother Brandham was taken from us, but the God of Elijah is still here. still moving and still commissioning a people. &gt;&gt; This is the hour of Elisha and the double portion. &gt;&gt; But you will never get to the double portion unless you see him taken away. It literally means if you perceive me when I'm removed from being with you that that Elisha must accept Elijah's departure. Now just see it with his physical eyes but see him as gone from him. In other words, if Elisha clung to Elijah, wishing him to remain, he would miss the transition. &gt;&gt; But if he perceived and he accepted that Elijah was truly taken away, then he was ready to step into his own calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if we have seen Elijah, then it's the hour for an Elisha people to arise. those who pick up the mantel and step into their commission. &gt;&gt; And this is not the hour to mourn for what has been taken. &gt;&gt; Or to chase after what God has already finished. &gt;&gt; I want to say this. How many searches has there been for Elijah? &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Perhaps he will come here. Maybe he'll come there, &gt;&gt; you know. Maybe he'll need this airplane. Maybe we'll need a tent. Maybe we'll need a bunch of trucks. Maybe we'll do this. &gt;&gt; You know, there's been so much speculation looking for his return. &gt;&gt; Surely the spirit of the Lord cast him down somewhere. &gt;&gt; Come on. But after 60 years, &gt;&gt; many of them that sent men out on a search for Elijah even themselves are dead and gone. &gt;&gt; And still Elijah hasn't returned. &gt;&gt; Who sent out those searches? &gt;&gt; The school of the prophets. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you, this is not the hour to mourn &gt;&gt; of what was taken away or to chase after what God has finished. This is the hour to smite the waters of impossibility and declare where is the God of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Somebody somebody must carry the double portion. &gt;&gt; Somebody got to rise in the power of the Holy Ghost with the revelation of that word. And that someone is you, the bride of Jesus Christ right here in this last age. And this is our commission. Take the mantel that has fallen to us. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Walk in that anointing. &gt;&gt; Manifest the same ministry. &gt;&gt; Not in one man but in a multimember body. &gt;&gt; The spirit of Elijah has come. And now an Elisha bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Must arise with a double portion &gt;&gt; and finish the work. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. You've asked for a hard thing. &gt;&gt; Well, if you want the token, the Holy Ghost indwell, you're going to have to keep your eyes on Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; As he moves, you move. &gt;&gt; As he moves you from justification to a sanctified life, follow him. &gt;&gt; Don't let him get out of sight. &gt;&gt; When he moves and you get a little jump or a shout, I say keep following him. Amen. Follow him until he sends his cloak, his mantle. The same spirit that covered Jesus, &gt;&gt; covers you. Whatever you do, get that token. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can get some people get, oh, they're mad now. You know, they're indignant. You have no right to the mantel of Elijah. That was only for brother Brandham. Listen, I ain't talking about trying to be the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about having his gift. &gt;&gt; His gift was not one of the nine spirits gifts of the spirit. It was no mere word of knowledge. It was the ministry of Jesus Christ again displayed in power to vindicate the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, let's just change the focus. Just as Elijah was caught up in a whirlwind and his mantle fell to Elisha, when Jesus &gt;&gt; when he ascended to heaven, &gt;&gt; he sent back his own mantle. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and the very spirit that clothed, empowered, and indwelled Jesus Christ has now wrapped his bride, a rapture inside and out. It'll wrap the body. It'll make you shout. It'll make you dance. It will anoint the spirit of the man. It'll give you a new spirit. It'll change your attitude. But it must come and dwell on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; It must abide with you forever. It must seal you to the day of redemption. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It'll make you like the disciples who were unsure and afraid and they went to the upper room and they waited and on the day of Pentecost he sent it down. The same spirit that was upon Jesus came back upon the church like and it descended upon them like a fire, like a robe. It was his mantle falling on the church. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't just a symbol. It was power. &gt;&gt; It was a baptism of the Holy Ghost. It was the divine covering of the authority. It was the anointing that turned ordinary men into vessels of the miraculous. &gt;&gt; And Elisha received a double portion. Not a copy, &gt;&gt; not something lesser, &gt;&gt; but a multiplied measure of the same spirit. &gt;&gt; And Elisha walked in that anointing. He did the works. He parted the waters. He continued the ministry of his predecessor. but even in a greater measure. And Jesus said we would do it. The works that I do shall you do also, &gt;&gt; and a dumb portion, and greater than these &gt;&gt; shall you do. &gt;&gt; Now, as we look at it for a moment, we ought to be determined tonight. God, whatever. I want that. I want that mantle. Amen. I want that mantle. You know, death has got to be bound. And we're here crossing Jordan. We got to be more sincere to get that double portion. Notice and Elisha is standing at the river and he's facing a difficult situation. School of the prophets are wa watching. The scoffers are there ridiculing. They're wondering. They're doubting that God is with the bride as he was with Elijah. Do we really have true worship? Or is it just the message with a dead form and no power? &gt;&gt; Little children mocking Elisha. Mocking the bride. Go up in the rapture like Elisha. &gt;&gt; There's never going to be a rapture. Go up, you baldhead. And they fell under a curse. &gt;&gt; Amen. And bears ate them up. And I tell you, the mockers today will be left behind and the Russian bear &gt;&gt; with his bomb is going to destroy them. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you receive the mantle, there is no obstacle. There's nothing can hinder you. No Jordan, no serpent of death, nothing can stand before you. Amen. You believe for the impossible. You do the work of Christ. You are Messiah. You are literally anointed one. You're walking, talking, spiritled expressions of the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Where is the God of Elijah?" We ask today, "Where is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? Where is the God of Jesus Christ? Where is the God of Elijah? Where's the God of William Brandom?" Here's the answer. He's revealed in his sons &gt;&gt; and his daughters. who worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; This is the hour of adoption. This the hour when full grown sons walk in their inheritance and they speak and their words are back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the earnest expectation of the creature that has been waiting for the revealing of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; This is the time, the fullness of the ages. This is where we're at. Oh my, we here at the fullness of time where full sons walk out and take every power that Satan has away from him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Then if you are, then you ought to rise up and take that anointing. &gt;&gt; We're not waiting on it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's already here. &gt;&gt; We've seen it work. &gt;&gt; Amen. All of you know about Sister Atlanta. She had four stage four hotkins li lymphoma and the doctors feared the chemo would kill her. She took that mantle and that ano and that with that anointing and struck her Jordan and crossed right back into health again. You all have heard this the testimony of Mariah with an autoimmune immune disease alipcia that had robbed her of her glory and the doctor said it was incurable. But that and that the river was uncrushable. But she struck that river and she crossed on dry ground and got her glory back. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right there's my daughter Lydia. had a baby boy Jude with a kidney disease and sitting in a service with her child and grabbed that mantle and ran to the altar and the prayer of faith was prayed and God put new kidneys in that baby's body. There's Kimberly W who stood in an uncrossable river. Her brother out in sin came through a prayer line. You were there brother Wayne. You prayed with her asking for her brother's salvation and by faith took her mantle and struck the river of impossibility. &gt;&gt; And while we were still conducting the prayer line, her brother Justin walks in with his pajamas on. Amen. And God gloriously saved him, saves his life and he's still saved. &gt;&gt; Have you got any river that you think are impossible? Have you got any mountain you can't tuddle through? &gt;&gt; Here the other day, a young man, Jason Tiger, walked into our church there. He He was there in bit of drugs and alcohol tatted up all from head to toe. He's listening in right now. And while he was sitting there in church, while the word went forth without any hands laid on him, he took the mana fell on him, he struck the river. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Drugs behind him, alcohol behind him, sinful life behind him, changed forever and still serving God. Hallelujah. Amen. What about baby Drew when he was there undeveloped hip and unable to walk or stand seen in a vision walking across the river and one day as a 18-month-old boy baby boy unable to stand or walk.
