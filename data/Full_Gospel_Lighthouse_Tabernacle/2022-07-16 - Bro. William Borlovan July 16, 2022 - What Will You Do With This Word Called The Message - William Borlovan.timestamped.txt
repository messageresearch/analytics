[50:45] gather around your unchanging
[50:48] unfailing word we ask father Lord that
[50:51] you help us Lord as we examine ourselves
[50:53] according to this word father the Lord
[50:55] that you help us to draw nearer to you
[50:57] may truly our hearts burn within us Lord
[50:59] and may something be said in this
[51:01] service Lord that even I as a minister
[51:03] can just take away Lord and just go over
[51:06] father Lord and to just commune with you
[51:09] we love you Lord we ask that you speak
[51:10] to our hearts forgive us of our sins
[51:12] Lord please be with each and every need
[51:14] we give you all the praise honor and
[51:16] Glory as we give our lives to you
[51:17] [Music]
[51:20] amen amen God bless you it's certainly
[51:22] good to be in the house of the Lord this
[51:23] evening
[51:24] it's always an honor and a privileged
[51:25] privilege to be able to stand before you
[51:27] and speak about the unchanging God that
[51:29] we serve
[51:30] the living word amen he's the living
[51:33] bread that came down from heaven and
[51:35] that's what we're feasting on you know
[51:37] we're not giving our own opinions and
[51:38] and we don't just give what we think and
[51:40] or you know opinions we're given the
[51:42] word of the Lord
[51:44] amen if you'll turn with me to your
[51:46] Bibles thank you musicians to Matthew
[51:48] chapter 27.
[51:51] we'll begin with verse 15.
[51:54] then Hebrews 13 8 which will be familiar
[51:57] to most of us you may not even have to
[51:58] turn there but Matthew 27 verse 15 will
[52:01] begin reading
[52:04] blessed be the name of the Lord
[52:07] there's no other place I'd rather be
[52:09] than in the house of God
[52:11] amen verse 15 now at the Feast at that
[52:14] Feast the governor
[52:16] was want to release and to the people a
[52:19] prisoner whom they would
[52:21] and they had then a notable prisoner
[52:24] called Barabbas
[52:26] therefore when they were gathered
[52:28] together pilate said unto them whom will
[52:31] ye that I release unto you Barabbas
[52:35] or Jesus which is called Christ
[52:39] for he knew that for Envy they had
[52:40] delivered him when he was set down on
[52:43] the Judgment seat his wife sent unto him
[52:45] saying have thou nothing to do with that
[52:47] just man
[52:49] for I have suffered many things as day
[52:51] in a dream because of him but the chief
[52:54] priests and Elders persuaded the
[52:55] multitude
[52:57] that they should ask Barabbas and
[53:00] Destroy Jesus
[53:02] think about that
[53:04] the chief priest the most respected
[53:07] religious order of that day
[53:09] they actually persuaded the multitude
[53:13] to ask for Barabbas and Destroy Jesus
[53:18] the governor answered and said it to
[53:19] them whether of the twain will ye that I
[53:22] release unto you they said Barabbas
[53:25] pilate saith unto them what shall I do
[53:28] then with Jesus which is called Christ
[53:32] they all say unto him let him be
[53:35] crucified and the governor said why what
[53:39] evil hath he done but they cried out the
[53:41] more saying let him be crucified
[53:45] when pilate saw that he could Prevail
[53:47] nothing
[53:48] but rather a tumlet was made he took
[53:50] water and washed his hands before the
[53:52] multitude saying I am innocent of the
[53:55] blood
[53:56] of this just person
[53:58] see to it then answered all the people
[54:01] and said his blood be on us
[54:04] and on our children
[54:07] then released he Barabbas unto them
[54:09] and when he had scourged Jesus
[54:12] he delivered him to be crucified
[54:16] then Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ
[54:20] the same yesterday today and forever
[54:23] amen God bless you as you're seated
[54:27] if I take a text this this evening I'd
[54:30] like to title this
[54:32] what will you do
[54:35] with this word called the message
[54:40] what will you do
[54:42] with this word call the message
[54:45] we hear that term a lot
[54:47] but we have to recognize that Jesus
[54:50] Christ is the anointed word for the day
[54:52] Christ means the anointed one
[54:55] in verse 22 I want to emphasize pilate
[54:58] saith unto them what shall I do then
[55:02] with Jesus which is called Christ
[55:05] was the anointed word of the day and
[55:08] pilate is asking them a very very
[55:10] pivotal question he said What then shall
[55:13] I do if you want Barabbas and you don't
[55:14] want the Prince of Life
[55:16] if you don't want the word for your day
[55:18] What then shall I do
[55:20] with this Jesus called the anointed one
[55:25] and they all said
[55:27] let him be crucified
[55:31] we know that history repeats itself
[55:34] the secular world even knows that when
[55:36] studying history you can even you can
[55:38] even study secular history and you can
[55:40] understand that history repeats itself
[55:47] history repeats itself we find that even
[55:49] nature
[55:51] excuse me even in nature you see the
[55:53] same thing
[55:54] every season whenever the Earth is in a
[55:57] certain rotation the distance from the
[55:58] Sun
[55:59] the same season happens when Springtime
[56:02] comes you can expect life to come forth
[56:05] in the Autumn you can expect the life to
[56:08] start going into the roots why because
[56:09] it's a repetition so whenever God the
[56:12] scripture also repeats itself so when
[56:14] things are in the same scriptural order
[56:17] you can look back in the scripture and
[56:19] see that what happened 2 000 years ago
[56:22] is actually repeating the same today
[56:27] scriptural history repeats itself
[56:29] because the word in letter could not
[56:32] redeem us
[56:33] the faith of the promise that you
[56:35] believed unto that promise you believe
[56:38] the Messiah was coming and that
[56:39] justified you
[56:41] but it took Jesus to actually come and
[56:44] bleed and die and to redeem us it took
[56:47] the blood of Jesus Christ to redeem us
[56:49] it could not save us while it was still
[56:52] in letter form it had to become
[56:54] manifested it had to be Vindicated and
[56:57] then it could be a Redemption
[56:59] for our sins when Isaiah 53 could not
[57:02] redeem us until he became flesh and
[57:05] blood when Isaiah said behold a virgin
[57:07] shall conceive and the Virgin did not
[57:10] conceive you at 700 years or so
[57:14] he could not have redeemed us but
[57:16] whenever that word that was swirling
[57:18] around brother Jerry found a place in a
[57:21] young teenage virgin and then Jesus came
[57:24] through the process of time in the
[57:26] Virgin and was actually born Emmanuel
[57:28] God himself he could then live and
[57:31] breathe and die for your sins and he
[57:33] could then die from my sins
[57:36] you see he had to become flesh
[57:39] in order to come and pay the price
[57:44] Malachi 4 and all these scriptures of
[57:46] this message in Revelations 10 7 and
[57:48] Luke 17 30 could not prepare the bride
[57:50] could not call out a bride could not
[57:52] even prepare us for a Rapture until it
[57:55] became manifested if God would not have
[57:57] sent his Prophet we would not be sitting
[58:00] in this church right now most of us
[58:01] would not be in any church right now
[58:04] but it had to come off of the letter
[58:07] get into God's chosen vessels and then
[58:11] God could be it could benefit us God
[58:13] could then call out a bride
[58:16] do you see
[58:20] brother Graham said when the word has
[58:22] been spoken
[58:24] for this certain generation there's
[58:26] going to be somebody rise on the scene
[58:29] that'll fulfill that word because God
[58:32] has spoken it's a Vindication of the
[58:35] spoken word do you realize that the
[58:37] bride is the actual Vindication of this
[58:40] message
[58:41] he said that the Bible said that there
[58:43] would be a bride without spot and
[58:44] wrinkle is she on the Earth today can
[58:47] you testify that despite of all your
[58:49] mistakes despite of all your human
[58:51] failures that you see there is a bride
[58:53] on the earth without a single spot or
[58:55] wrinkle
[58:56] and it's not that no that another human
[58:58] don't see a spot or wrinkle it's God
[59:00] that doesn't see a spot or a wrinkle
[59:03] so that is the Vindication that the
[59:07] message is right
[59:08] because God said there'd be abroad well
[59:11] before they can be a brother there's got
[59:12] to be a restoration God has to send a
[59:14] prophet
[59:15] did he
[59:17] well here we are
[59:21] in John 1 14 in the beginning in first
[59:24] John 1 in the beginning was the word and
[59:26] the Word was with God and the Word was
[59:29] God
[59:30] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[59:32] among us and we beheld his glory the
[59:34] glory of the only begotten of the father
[59:36] full of grace and truth he said think
[59:39] your garments Washed by the Water
[59:42] of the bleeding word
[59:45] now the Bible cannot bleed
[59:48] so why would a prophet make a statement
[59:50] that we're Washed by the Water of the
[59:52] bleeding word is because he came in
[59:54] flesh he was the word made flesh and
[59:57] that enabled the word to bleed for you
[1:00:00] because he was not the Blood of Mary he
[1:00:02] was not the blood of Joseph he was not
[1:00:04] the blood of a Jew he was not the blood
[1:00:06] of a gentile he was not the blood of the
[1:00:07] Samaritan he was the blood of God
[1:00:10] the prophet tells us that we are saved
[1:00:13] by the blood of God
[1:00:16] if we're saved by Jew if we're saved by
[1:00:18] Samaritan then we it's impossible we're
[1:00:20] all lost we are saved by the blood of
[1:00:24] God
[1:00:24] [Music]
[1:00:25] he said the word bled for you and you
[1:00:28] are washed in the bleeding word the word
[1:00:30] bleeding the life of God and the word
[1:00:33] and the Word was bled for you
[1:00:38] now God has sent the greatest message to
[1:00:42] the Earth
[1:00:43] says Jesus Christ
[1:00:46] do you believe that tonight
[1:00:51] you think about it
[1:00:52] how many great men have lived on the
[1:00:54] earth throughout all the church ages
[1:00:56] and God has predestinated us to live in
[1:00:59] this end time
[1:01:01] and to be under under the voice of God
[1:01:04] the voice behind The Voice
[1:01:07] and to be a part of the greatest
[1:01:10] Ministry since Jesus Christ
[1:01:13] the prophet would even be bold enough to
[1:01:15] say that he did more miracles in his own
[1:01:18] Ministry talking about he said my humble
[1:01:21] Ministry than he did in his own 2000
[1:01:23] years ago
[1:01:25] so how can there how can this generation
[1:01:27] be without an excuse how can this
[1:01:30] generation have an excuse when he would
[1:01:31] go around the world seven times forward
[1:01:34] and backward and God would have
[1:01:35] indicated and he'd preach the word you
[1:01:36] think of this challenge he would preach
[1:01:38] the word and he said if I've told you
[1:01:41] the truth
[1:01:44] then you let God come and vindicate it
[1:01:46] who what man would be brave enough to do
[1:01:49] that
[1:01:52] could you imagine it's July here and and
[1:01:54] someone and and brother Andrew's
[1:01:56] standing here and saying and and saying
[1:01:58] if it's if this is the truth it would be
[1:02:00] if this is the truth then it'd go
[1:02:02] outside there'll be snow and it's July
[1:02:04] but if God told him to say that it would
[1:02:06] be snow outside
[1:02:08] you see but I'm trying to just be
[1:02:10] extreme that no man can do that to be
[1:02:12] able to say after preaching the word
[1:02:14] if I have told you the truth let him
[1:02:18] come down right now
[1:02:20] and vindicate that what I've told you is
[1:02:23] the truth
[1:02:25] do you think when that when when brother
[1:02:27] Brown was in Oregon and that Maniac ran
[1:02:29] through the back door to break every
[1:02:30] bone in his body do you think that he
[1:02:32] within himself he might he might have
[1:02:33] been a boxer in his natural self
[1:02:36] but he couldn't compete that that guy
[1:02:38] was some heavyweight
[1:02:39] brother Brown might have been Bantam or
[1:02:41] feather or whatever whatever the classes
[1:02:43] are he was a little man but yet whenever
[1:02:45] he came you see then God came and
[1:02:48] Vindicated his prophet and he said today
[1:02:51] you'll fall over my feet what what five
[1:02:54] foot man could say something like that
[1:02:57] what five foot man could say that today
[1:02:59] you'll fall on my feet
[1:03:02] but God Vindicated that it wasn't a man
[1:03:04] God Vindicated that this message didn't
[1:03:06] come from the mind of a man
[1:03:09] if this message came from the mind of a
[1:03:11] man we're all lost
[1:03:13] if this message came from the mind of a
[1:03:15] man and we're just following the opinion
[1:03:17] then God have mercy
[1:03:20] this message is Jesus Christ
[1:03:24] he said speaking here and it is I be not
[1:03:26] afraid he said but I believe that Jesus
[1:03:29] Christ is here
[1:03:31] I believe he's here in every strength
[1:03:34] and everything that he ever was on the
[1:03:37] Earth
[1:03:39] the only difference is the Corporal body
[1:03:42] that sits on the throne of God
[1:03:45] and that's there as a peace offering for
[1:03:47] you he said this in 1960 true in 1962
[1:03:51] and it was true then
[1:03:52] in 2022 it's true now you think Jesus
[1:03:58] Christ is here
[1:04:00] and he's here in every strength
[1:04:04] he's no weaker just because the prophet
[1:04:06] went home
[1:04:08] and everything he was ever on the earth
[1:04:11] he's still the same right here it's not
[1:04:13] just in this generation it's not just in
[1:04:15] 2022 but it's in this service and every
[1:04:19] strength he's the same
[1:04:21] in every strength
[1:04:24] God just needs an agency the agency God
[1:04:26] uses is just humble human vessels
[1:04:30] that that's that's all
[1:04:32] in Exodus 3 8 speaking of Moses he said
[1:04:34] and I am come down to deliver them out
[1:04:37] of the hand of the Egyptians and to
[1:04:39] bring them up out of the land unto a
[1:04:41] good land a large unto a land flowing
[1:04:44] with milk and honey now here God said
[1:04:46] that I am come down
[1:04:49] but who did he send
[1:04:51] he sent Moses
[1:04:53] when you look you've seen Moses was in
[1:04:55] Egypt but God identified himself in the
[1:04:58] prophet to say that I have come down
[1:05:01] to deliver them out of the hand of the
[1:05:03] Egyptians and to bring them
[1:05:07] God don't just bring you out of the
[1:05:08] world to leave you sitting there
[1:05:10] God brings us out of the world to then
[1:05:12] put us into him in our position that is
[1:05:15] redemption
[1:05:16] so if you notice Moses was not the one
[1:05:18] that led them over to the land of milk
[1:05:20] and honey it was the Joshua Ministry
[1:05:22] that did that but God identified himself
[1:05:24] with both he said I have come down to
[1:05:27] deliver them out of Egypt and to bring
[1:05:28] them into the land
[1:05:30] that was Moses and then Elijah but God
[1:05:33] still identified himself as being the
[1:05:36] one doing that
[1:05:38] in first Thessalonians 4 17 the Lord
[1:05:41] himself
[1:05:43] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:05:46] the shout in that scripture think what a
[1:05:49] blessed people you are
[1:05:51] people all over the religious landscape
[1:05:53] of the world are expecting to hear this
[1:05:55] loud deafening trumpet or this loud
[1:05:58] shout or however they have it in their
[1:06:00] own mind
[1:06:01] and the shout is the message
[1:06:04] and you've heard it
[1:06:06] and if you really heard the message and
[1:06:09] you really are become a part of the
[1:06:11] shout
[1:06:12] then you're going to be part of the
[1:06:14] Resurrection you're in the rapture
[1:06:16] you're already in it you can't be in the
[1:06:18] shout and miss the Trump
[1:06:23] now the burden of vindication
[1:06:26] does not fall on you and me
[1:06:29] the burden of vindication does not even
[1:06:31] fall on the messenger the burden of
[1:06:34] indication falls on God himself
[1:06:38] it's not your job or our job to
[1:06:42] vindicate
[1:06:43] the message God's already done that
[1:06:46] we're not we're not climbing up in the
[1:06:48] mountains raising our hand for that sort
[1:06:49] of hit he's already done that the bride
[1:06:52] has got the sword in her hand
[1:06:54] we're not we're not looking for caves
[1:06:57] brother Jerry looking and just waiting
[1:06:59] to see if that angel will appear we
[1:07:00] believe the testimony
[1:07:03] we believe the testimony that got an
[1:07:06] angel met him why because we see the
[1:07:08] works
[1:07:09] God Vindicated it how many people were
[1:07:12] there with Moses in the burning bush not
[1:07:14] one
[1:07:15] but when Moses said I met the pillar of
[1:07:17] fire I met the I am and this is what he
[1:07:19] told me to do and they seen it to
[1:07:21] disbelieve that sign
[1:07:24] with sin
[1:07:30] in the church age book don't you love
[1:07:32] the church age book
[1:07:36] brother Graham said though he's talking
[1:07:37] about the seventh Church age messenger
[1:07:40] he said though he will not be popular
[1:07:43] he will be Vindicated by God
[1:07:46] as Jesus authenticated John and the Holy
[1:07:49] Ghost authenticated Jesus we can well
[1:07:51] expect this man will first of all
[1:07:54] uh first of all authenticated by the
[1:07:56] spirit working in his life in Acts of
[1:07:59] power that are indisputable and found
[1:08:02] nowhere else
[1:08:05] you had carnal impersonations but you
[1:08:07] couldn't find the movement of the spirit
[1:08:08] like you could in the prophet's Ministry
[1:08:12] in this capacity
[1:08:14] and Jesus himself in returning will
[1:08:17] authenticate him even as he
[1:08:19] authenticated John
[1:08:21] John witnessed that Jesus was coming and
[1:08:23] so will this man like John witness that
[1:08:25] Jesus is coming and the Very return of
[1:08:28] Christ will prove
[1:08:30] that this man indeed was the Forerunner
[1:08:33] of a second coming
[1:08:35] this is the final evidence
[1:08:38] that this indeed is the prophet of
[1:08:40] Malachi 4 for the end of the Gentile
[1:08:42] period will be Jesus himself appearing
[1:08:46] then it will be too late for those who
[1:08:49] have rejected him
[1:08:52] think about that that will be the final
[1:08:54] evidence
[1:08:56] that brother Brandon was Malachi 4.
[1:08:58] is when Jesus comes
[1:09:01] Jesus himself was the Vindication of
[1:09:04] John the Baptist ministry
[1:09:10] Jesus himself
[1:09:12] is the Vindication of the truth and
[1:09:14] accuracy of this message
[1:09:16] it don't have to be embellished by man
[1:09:18] it don't have to be pumped up it don't
[1:09:20] have to be propped up it don't have to
[1:09:21] be faked it is reality
[1:09:24] and Jesus whenever John you know it
[1:09:26] wasn't to John or like I said it wasn't
[1:09:28] to John the Baptist or brother Branham
[1:09:30] they they didn't have to wring their
[1:09:32] hands in stress when John said that
[1:09:34] there's common one after me it did not
[1:09:36] stress or concern him about whether the
[1:09:38] Messiah would appear or not
[1:09:40] he said he who told me to baptize said
[1:09:43] upon whom you'll see the Holy Ghost
[1:09:45] descending and remaining on he's the
[1:09:47] Lamb of God
[1:09:49] so when he was preaching he did not get
[1:09:51] anxious and all worried if Jesus was
[1:09:53] really coming was the Messiah going to
[1:09:55] come he just did his job
[1:09:58] and Jesus when Jesus came whenever they
[1:10:01] were questioning him are you the Messiah
[1:10:02] and all these different things and he
[1:10:04] was baptized and in one day
[1:10:06] as he was baptized and he looked and he
[1:10:09] seen a man come in a common looking man
[1:10:12] coming down the river to be baptized
[1:10:16] and he said I have need to be baptized
[1:10:18] of thee Jesus said suffer it to be so
[1:10:22] Jesus himself
[1:10:25] God in flesh brother Jonathan was the
[1:10:28] very Vindication that John foreign his
[1:10:32] first coming
[1:10:34] it was God and flesh Jesus God
[1:10:38] Vindicated John the Baptist ministry
[1:10:40] himself
[1:10:41] he didn't need religious people
[1:10:43] he didn't need anybody else he himself
[1:10:45] he had a humble Forerunner and he
[1:10:48] himself stepped into the water and then
[1:10:49] he began his ministry
[1:10:52] the message produces what it preaches
[1:10:58] that's the Vindication as I said earlier
[1:11:01] did the message preach that there's a
[1:11:04] bride that the message is the bridegroom
[1:11:07] call and is there a bride on the earth
[1:11:09] that's the vindication
[1:11:11] that the message what it teaches and
[1:11:15] what it preaches is reality there
[1:11:17] there's good people all over the world
[1:11:20] I'm not don't don't misunderstand that
[1:11:23] I'm trying to say if someone doesn't
[1:11:24] believe the message and they're just not
[1:11:26] in the economy of God they can still be
[1:11:28] in the economy of God but we're talking
[1:11:29] about the bride
[1:11:32] that that that's why I believe I'm
[1:11:34] preaching to is the bride
[1:11:36] that's who we're talking about is the
[1:11:38] bride
[1:11:39] so when the bride being on Earth this
[1:11:41] message produces lives above reproach
[1:11:46] the word what it says where you've got
[1:11:49] multitudes and multitudes of people that
[1:11:51] cannot live this word
[1:11:53] from the laity to the ministry they
[1:11:55] cannot live the word but the bride can
[1:11:57] live it why
[1:11:59] because it's the holy ghost in her
[1:12:01] vindicating the word living out the word
[1:12:04] through their lives
[1:12:07] we cannot live this message in this
[1:12:09] Bible through ourselves but it's the
[1:12:11] Holy Ghost in US
[1:12:13] and that is the Vindication of it
[1:12:16] let me tell you something this message
[1:12:18] produces the cream of the crop
[1:12:21] this message produces the best preachers
[1:12:23] this message produces the best Brothers
[1:12:26] the best sisters the best families the
[1:12:29] best marriages the best children this
[1:12:32] message produces it
[1:12:35] the best
[1:12:38] glory to God
[1:12:40] we're not held all all these different
[1:12:43] best I just named were not held together
[1:12:45] by something that somebody said in 1963.
[1:12:49] it's not some Dr Phil or or whoever Dr
[1:12:52] Dobson and it just steps to try and get
[1:12:54] better this is reality
[1:12:57] this message doesn't just live at church
[1:12:59] this message goes home and lives it
[1:13:01] lives on Monday it lives on Tuesday it
[1:13:03] lives on Wednesday it lives all the way
[1:13:05] through it's not just it's not just for
[1:13:07] church
[1:13:12] the angel that met brother Branham in
[1:13:13] the cave and explained the three pulls
[1:13:15] of the ministry it happened just like he
[1:13:17] said
[1:13:18] brother brand will describe a pillar of
[1:13:20] fire and in 1933 while baptizing the
[1:13:22] 17th person it came down in front of
[1:13:25] witnesses
[1:13:28] God appeared in the cloud
[1:13:30] over Arizona there
[1:13:32] showing the fully wigged one
[1:13:35] why because we're living in an hour of
[1:13:37] judgment
[1:13:39] now remember to you it was Shalom relax
[1:13:42] peace
[1:13:44] I've come down and I'm going to take
[1:13:45] care of everything I fully redeemed you
[1:13:47] Ruth
[1:13:48] but to the world a prophet picked up a
[1:13:52] rock
[1:13:53] and he threw it in the air
[1:13:56] and he said thus saith the Lord judgment
[1:13:58] is going to strike the West Coast
[1:14:01] how can a man within himself ever say a
[1:14:04] thing like that
[1:14:05] but three days later or so Alaska almost
[1:14:07] sunk
[1:14:09] and what happened that began a judgment
[1:14:11] cycle on this nation in the world that
[1:14:13] hasn't stopped since
[1:14:16] but to you it's peace
[1:14:18] to you it's love to you it's Mercy to
[1:14:22] you it's thank you Lord
[1:14:26] but to the world is judgment
[1:14:29] he said I wasn't the one that appeared
[1:14:31] down there on the river
[1:14:32] he said I was only standing there when
[1:14:34] he appeared
[1:14:36] I'm not the one that performs these
[1:14:38] things and foretells these things that
[1:14:39] happens as perfectly as they are I'm
[1:14:41] only the one that's near when he does it
[1:14:45] I was only a voice that he used to say
[1:14:47] it wasn't what I knew it's what I
[1:14:49] surrendered myself to that he spoke
[1:14:52] through it wasn't me it wasn't the
[1:14:55] seventh angel oh no it was the
[1:14:57] manifestation of the son of man it
[1:14:59] wasn't the Angel's message it was the
[1:15:01] mystery that God unfolded it's not a man
[1:15:03] it's God
[1:15:07] the angel was not the son of man he was
[1:15:10] the messenger from the son of man the
[1:15:13] son of man is Christ he's the one that
[1:15:16] you're feeding on
[1:15:18] he's the one that we preach
[1:15:22] you're not feeding on a man
[1:15:24] a man his words will fail but you're
[1:15:25] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[1:15:29] the son of man
[1:15:31] now it's pretty obvious that if if this
[1:15:33] word of this message was not Vindicated
[1:15:36] by a man
[1:15:37] then why in the world can it be
[1:15:39] discredited by man
[1:15:42] why
[1:15:43] if God Vindicated it then what makes a
[1:15:47] man
[1:15:48] or woman
[1:15:50] what makes a person think that they can
[1:15:52] come around and discredit this message
[1:15:54] when God was the one that came down God
[1:15:57] was the one that came in a pillar of
[1:15:59] fire they didn't stand there and discern
[1:16:01] the hearts of the thoughts of the intent
[1:16:03] of Sarah's heart God did that they're
[1:16:05] not going to change your body God's
[1:16:07] going to change your body
[1:16:10] God Vindicated it God's watching over it
[1:16:13] God has manifested it and God will take
[1:16:15] it home one day
[1:16:17] God's going to take this little bride
[1:16:18] home
[1:16:21] a man can discredit this message
[1:16:25] I said when Moses met the pillar firing
[1:16:27] a burning bush there were no Witnesses
[1:16:30] nobody was there but they seemed
[1:16:33] and that let out two million or more
[1:16:35] people
[1:16:36] faith in that but you see whenever
[1:16:38] whenever Moses went down there and he
[1:16:40] performed at first miracle one of the
[1:16:41] first there when the river turned to
[1:16:43] blood you know Pharaoh at first
[1:16:46] you know he you've seen the Ten
[1:16:48] Commandments
[1:16:50] he kind of feared at first a little bit
[1:16:52] but then a news article came out
[1:16:56] and said actually it wasn't Supernatural
[1:16:59] a volcano all so many miles away blew up
[1:17:03] and and the mud spewed into the river
[1:17:05] and that's what caused it
[1:17:07] so your God is nothing special this
[1:17:10] message that you're believing this first
[1:17:12] Exodus message is nothing special a
[1:17:14] volcano did that
[1:17:18] so we see that same Spirit don't die
[1:17:20] remember history repeats itself
[1:17:23] the Pharisees after the resurrection of
[1:17:25] Jesus
[1:17:30] do you know that was the Easter seal his
[1:17:31] resurrection
[1:17:33] if Jesus didn't raise from the dead
[1:17:36] every all the Miracles all the words all
[1:17:39] the teaching and preaching
[1:17:41] would not have amounted to anything had
[1:17:43] he not rose from the dead that's what
[1:17:45] the prophet said that sealed it
[1:17:47] because that proved that he was more
[1:17:49] than a man
[1:17:52] so the Pharisees after he rose from the
[1:17:54] dead
[1:17:55] the Pharisees no doubt had written
[1:17:57] notarized confessions of the soldiers
[1:18:00] that they were paid that that they were
[1:18:03] paid to to keep quiet while the
[1:18:04] disciples came and stole the body of
[1:18:05] Jesus and and and and here it right here
[1:18:08] is the written confession
[1:18:10] here's a written confession of a Roman
[1:18:12] soldier that that the disciples came and
[1:18:14] stole them
[1:18:15] I don't care what the devil produces
[1:18:19] I don't care what article and what
[1:18:21] accusation the critic produces we have
[1:18:24] the Holy Ghost today because he rose
[1:18:27] from the dead that's how I know
[1:18:29] that's how you know you know brother
[1:18:31] Shannon that he rose from the dead
[1:18:33] because if he didn't rise from the dead
[1:18:34] you couldn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:18:37] that's the Vindication of it
[1:18:40] that he rose from the dead you don't
[1:18:42] have to it's a blessing to go see the
[1:18:43] empty tomb
[1:18:45] but what you have to know that he rose
[1:18:47] from the dead is when he vindicates it
[1:18:49] is when you get the Holy Ghost
[1:18:53] it would be impossible to have the Holy
[1:18:55] Ghost if he didn't raise from the dead
[1:19:02] so here we are and the word has been
[1:19:03] Vindicated
[1:19:05] the seven Thunders
[1:19:07] have awoke the bride
[1:19:10] to recognize who she is
[1:19:14] this is different than just other Church
[1:19:16] ages this is different from different
[1:19:17] churches because we have been awakened
[1:19:20] to the fact
[1:19:22] that there's a Rapture at hand
[1:19:25] Jesus said in John 15 if I had not come
[1:19:28] and spoken unto them they had not had
[1:19:31] sin
[1:19:32] think about how powerful that is if I
[1:19:34] didn't come and actually preach the
[1:19:36] truth to you you could have kept going
[1:19:38] on and you wouldn't have had any sin
[1:19:41] he said but now they have no cloak for
[1:19:43] their sin he that hateth me hateth the
[1:19:46] father also if I had not and I think
[1:19:49] history repeats itself think about the
[1:19:50] day we're living in If I had not done
[1:19:53] among them The Works which no other man
[1:19:56] did they had not had sin but now they
[1:19:59] have both seen and hated both me and my
[1:20:01] father
[1:20:03] when the prophet of God was here and
[1:20:04] he'd they were don't think he didn't
[1:20:07] have critics
[1:20:08] but many times they were they wouldn't
[1:20:10] dare come
[1:20:11] they would always talk behind his back
[1:20:13] that's just that that's just like a
[1:20:15] devil that's just like the devil
[1:20:18] he waited till God arrested in the
[1:20:20] Garden of Eden to come and spoil the
[1:20:21] masterpiece
[1:20:22] that's just like a devil
[1:20:28] so the prophet of God they would
[1:20:30] criticize him on Jesus name baptism
[1:20:31] wouldn't they
[1:20:32] and he stood before 300 preachers that's
[1:20:35] more than what we probably have sitting
[1:20:37] in this church right now
[1:20:39] but let's just say because this is a
[1:20:41] visual say every single one three three
[1:20:43] hundred preachers and he said I know
[1:20:45] what you have against me he said but one
[1:20:47] of you come up here take your Bible not
[1:20:50] your church green not your pamphlet not
[1:20:52] your own idea not your own opinion you
[1:20:53] take your Bible and come Stand By Me and
[1:20:56] You disprove Jesus name baptism you come
[1:20:59] and you disprove serpency not one of a
[1:21:01] move
[1:21:02] not one of a move why because they
[1:21:05] couldn't resist it
[1:21:08] they could not resist the Vindication of
[1:21:12] the word
[1:21:14] then they say they're gonna all come get
[1:21:16] baptized but how many came not one
[1:21:19] not one so if the message had not come
[1:21:22] and taught true baptism in the name of
[1:21:24] Jesus Christ they would have
[1:21:27] they had not had sinned
[1:21:29] but now they have no cloak for their sin
[1:21:32] if the original sin didn't expose
[1:21:35] Satan's serpent seed if that had not
[1:21:37] been revealed they would have a cloak
[1:21:38] for their sin
[1:21:39] but now they have no cloak for their sin
[1:21:42] do you see the word is open there's no
[1:21:44] more excuse
[1:21:46] if the word didn't actually expose that
[1:21:48] denominationalism was the mark of the
[1:21:51] beast now not the people
[1:21:53] not the people but the system
[1:21:57] there's a big difference the system
[1:21:59] that's why the message calls come out of
[1:22:01] her my people
[1:22:03] so if Jesus hadn't exposed that in this
[1:22:05] end time they would not have sinned
[1:22:07] but now they have no cloak for their sin
[1:22:11] but you know back then when Jesus was on
[1:22:13] the Earth
[1:22:14] when he would do Miracles and things and
[1:22:16] he would be teaching
[1:22:18] they were discrediting him
[1:22:20] all the time they said we don't know
[1:22:22] about you Jesus healed the blind man he
[1:22:24] said we don't we don't know about this
[1:22:25] Jesus we're Moses's disciple where
[1:22:27] Moses's disciple
[1:22:29] and Jesus said for if he had believed me
[1:22:31] he would have if you would have believed
[1:22:32] Moses you'd believe me for he wrote Of
[1:22:34] Me
[1:22:36] what do people say today
[1:22:38] we're Jesus's disciple
[1:22:41] we're Paul's disciple well if you would
[1:22:43] believe Jesus he spoke of the Prophet
[1:22:45] coming if you believe Paul he spoke of
[1:22:47] the message coming
[1:22:52] foreign
[1:22:58] he said here in the spoken word's
[1:23:00] Original Seed he said let me say this
[1:23:02] not sacrilegious but let me say this
[1:23:04] about the message that I'm preaching
[1:23:07] if God don't vindicate this to be the
[1:23:09] truth
[1:23:10] then it's not
[1:23:13] isn't that so simple
[1:23:15] if God doesn't vindicate it
[1:23:18] and he just delivered it he said if God
[1:23:21] doesn't vindicate this to be the truth
[1:23:22] then it's not
[1:23:25] you talk about a man knowing where he's
[1:23:27] standing
[1:23:28] but if the word vindicates I'm telling
[1:23:31] you the truth then believe the word
[1:23:35] they are what testify whether I'm
[1:23:37] telling the truth or not they're the
[1:23:39] testimony he promised this for the in
[1:23:42] the last days
[1:23:43] here it is
[1:23:47] he said that it would do here it is
[1:23:49] we're going right into it now you'll see
[1:23:51] whether it's the truth or not let God do
[1:23:54] the testifying see how he just put it in
[1:23:56] the hands of God
[1:23:57] he knew where he stood and he knew that
[1:23:59] God would come behind him and say Amen
[1:24:05] he says here it is we're going into it
[1:24:07] right now let God do the testifying if
[1:24:09] the works the things that I'm preaching
[1:24:11] don't testify back that it's the truth
[1:24:13] and it's not the truth but if the word
[1:24:15] speaks of this and here it is then what
[1:24:17] are you going to do about it
[1:24:19] see he gets it and he puts it back in
[1:24:21] our laps
[1:24:24] that's the spirit of Elijah when he was
[1:24:26] on Mount Carmel he he said you know
[1:24:29] let's y'all you know Israel you'll
[1:24:31] worshiping Bell
[1:24:33] let's let's prove this matter if God be
[1:24:35] God let him show up
[1:24:37] now Elijah knew where he was standing
[1:24:41] he wouldn't have done that brother and
[1:24:42] said without a vision
[1:24:49] the bride knows where she stands
[1:24:52] the Bride is a mature lady
[1:24:54] she's not tossed around
[1:24:56] she's not tossed from Pillar To Post
[1:24:58] she knows that she's missed Jesus Christ
[1:25:02] in John 10 Jesus speaking said if I do
[1:25:04] not the works of my father Believe Me
[1:25:06] Not
[1:25:07] but if I do though you believe me not
[1:25:10] believe the works that ye may know and
[1:25:12] believe that the father is in me denying
[1:25:15] him
[1:25:17] now God vindicates his word amen God
[1:25:20] vindicates his word
[1:25:22] and he sent his Prophet around the Earth
[1:25:25] and Vindicated his the message God's
[1:25:28] message seven times
[1:25:31] and despite all the infallible proofs
[1:25:34] despite all the Vindication despite all
[1:25:37] the Miracles despite all all the word
[1:25:40] the world still rejected it
[1:25:45] this is a rejected
[1:25:47] speaking in the world this is a rejected
[1:25:49] message
[1:25:50] it's a hated message
[1:25:52] why
[1:25:54] because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:25:56] yesterday today and forever
[1:26:00] if Jesus was rejected then
[1:26:03] why would he why would we expect the
[1:26:06] whole world
[1:26:07] to accept him now
[1:26:10] if he does the same Works he preaches
[1:26:13] the same word and does everything the
[1:26:16] world rejects him
[1:26:19] whenever brother was trying to go into
[1:26:21] Africa to win souls for Jesus Christ the
[1:26:23] denominational churches literally
[1:26:25] blocked him from doing that
[1:26:27] they literally banned it they hated that
[1:26:29] Jesus name baptism they hated what he
[1:26:31] preached so much
[1:26:34] that they banded together
[1:26:36] and they United themselves together
[1:26:38] against the word just as the Pharisees
[1:26:41] and all the religious world of that day
[1:26:43] United themselves with the government to
[1:26:45] crucify Jesus
[1:26:48] because there's got to be a uniting with
[1:26:50] something
[1:26:51] and so the bride is uniting with Jesus
[1:26:54] Christ
[1:26:56] so God had his Prophet on the Earth
[1:27:00] and he had his Prophet preach a sermon
[1:27:02] that I'd recommend you go listen to
[1:27:03] called the indictment
[1:27:06] now an indictment means a formal charge
[1:27:08] or accusation of a serious crime
[1:27:14] and in God's Prophet indicted the
[1:27:17] churches
[1:27:18] for the second crucifixion
[1:27:21] of the word
[1:27:25] he said how he said you how do you
[1:27:28] crucify the word you can't drive nail
[1:27:30] spikes into the word you can't get the
[1:27:33] word and nail it to a cross he said he's
[1:27:35] crucified from the denominational
[1:27:37] pulpits
[1:27:39] because whenever the ministry would come
[1:27:41] into town they would warn the people
[1:27:43] from the pulpits and say don't go there
[1:27:45] he has fanaticism don't believe that and
[1:27:49] they didn't realize that they were
[1:27:50] actually killing their own people
[1:27:52] spiritually when they were doing that so
[1:27:55] after that went on for a long time and
[1:27:57] God gave him the gave brother bran the
[1:27:59] permission to stand up he said I'm his
[1:28:02] attorney and he said that I indict this
[1:28:05] generation for the second crucifixion
[1:28:08] of Jesus Christ
[1:28:10] because they did they took the same Lord
[1:28:12] Jesus Hebrews 13 8. they did the same
[1:28:15] Works preached the same word rejected it
[1:28:18] and as I said nailed it to a cross from
[1:28:20] their denominational pulpits and told
[1:28:23] the people not to hear the prophet
[1:28:28] and today we're standing in another
[1:28:31] polished judgment Hall
[1:28:34] now not a Jesus of 2000 years ago
[1:28:37] but the Jesus of today
[1:28:39] now let me just say this in here
[1:28:41] whenever you whenever you hear the name
[1:28:44] Jesus
[1:28:45] that can bring many different things you
[1:28:47] know Jesus what he did or maybe how he
[1:28:49] walked the shores of Galilee maybe how
[1:28:51] he suffered maybe how he loved maybe how
[1:28:53] he prayed for the children maybe how he
[1:28:54] healed the lepers
[1:28:57] but what we have to understand is that
[1:28:59] whenever we speak of Jesus
[1:29:02] Christ the anointed word
[1:29:05] it's not the man from 2000 years ago
[1:29:07] it's also the word anointed today
[1:29:12] you see just as the religious people
[1:29:14] from 2000 years ago could look back and
[1:29:16] say we love Moses we're Moses's
[1:29:18] disciples it was easy to look back
[1:29:22] and they crucified the god of Moses the
[1:29:24] very Pillar of Fire that led Moses they
[1:29:27] put on a tree and hung him
[1:29:31] so now
[1:29:32] what does the world do I love Jesus
[1:29:36] I love Jesus 2000 years ago I love Jesus
[1:29:39] but they crucify the word
[1:29:43] you see it's it's not the Jesus of 2000
[1:29:46] years ago but today because remember
[1:29:48] he's the same in power he's the same in
[1:29:50] word he's the same indeed he's the same
[1:29:52] in Miracles he's the same in every way
[1:29:54] but his literal body
[1:29:59] so that is Jesus Christ is in the form
[1:30:01] of his bride
[1:30:03] she is the man about everyone says she's
[1:30:05] the manifestation of the hour
[1:30:08] so this message just as Jesus was 2000
[1:30:12] years ago is attacked
[1:30:14] scoffed
[1:30:17] criticized
[1:30:19] beat
[1:30:20] slap
[1:30:22] spit upon
[1:30:25] they attack the pillar of Fire
[1:30:30] they attack the pillar fires as old you
[1:30:33] know that that was just the light in the
[1:30:35] in the building and it was just the
[1:30:36] angle
[1:30:38] lights in a building don't come and
[1:30:40] discern your heart
[1:30:41] lights in a building don't come and take
[1:30:43] every Spirit under his control lights
[1:30:46] don't do that
[1:30:47] it's that same Pillar of Fire and it's
[1:30:50] here right now
[1:30:52] is still here to do the same work
[1:30:55] it's not it's it's Satan beating the
[1:30:59] word
[1:31:00] but he's got this day coming
[1:31:02] [Applause]
[1:31:05] they attack the cloud in Arizona and
[1:31:07] some missile
[1:31:09] it's ridiculous
[1:31:11] it's no more it's no less ridiculous
[1:31:13] than to think that we came from monkeys
[1:31:16] because a Thor missile cannot awaken the
[1:31:19] bride
[1:31:20] a Thor missile cannot reveal the Seven
[1:31:23] Seals
[1:31:24] seven angels the white wigged one came
[1:31:26] Glory
[1:31:28] [Applause]
[1:31:33] he came in this end time
[1:31:42] as the white wigged one
[1:31:46] what did Jesus say all judgment is
[1:31:48] committed to the son
[1:31:53] but they scoff
[1:31:55] they attack
[1:31:57] and them seven angels met a prophet
[1:32:00] on the Earth
[1:32:02] and commissioned him to go from Arizona
[1:32:04] back east and revealed Seven Seals
[1:32:06] that's why we're here
[1:32:09] is because them seals have been revealed
[1:32:13] a thorough missile would not send a
[1:32:15] profit back east
[1:32:16] we would not be gathered here over a
[1:32:18] Thor miss or an auditorium light
[1:32:20] that's ridiculous
[1:32:25] an auditorium light would not allow you
[1:32:27] to live a life above sin a Thor missile
[1:32:31] what would that do for you
[1:32:34] the very presence of God is in his
[1:32:36] church
[1:32:38] doing the same works
[1:32:41] believing the same word
[1:32:49] we're still under the effect of the open
[1:32:51] Word
[1:32:53] and we will be when the Rapture comes
[1:32:55] we're still going to be under the effect
[1:32:56] whenever in the Millennium we're still
[1:32:58] under the effect whenever the new
[1:33:00] heavens and the new Earth come down
[1:33:01] we're still under the effect
[1:33:03] when we've been there Ten Thousand Years
[1:33:04] brother Fred and it seems like we've
[1:33:06] just begun we're still under the effects
[1:33:07] of the open Word
[1:33:10] and you say Thor missile
[1:33:12] get out of here
[1:33:15] it's ridiculous
[1:33:18] it really is
[1:33:21] now you see taking the words
[1:33:25] of a god-chosen vessel
[1:33:29] and misconstruing them to say something
[1:33:31] that it's not is nothing new
[1:33:35] Satan did it from the very beginning he
[1:33:37] said you know when he misquoted God
[1:33:41] Satan did it from the very beginning
[1:33:43] they did it to Jesus
[1:33:45] whenever that he was in polished
[1:33:46] judgment Hall and they came and began to
[1:33:49] accuse him
[1:33:51] they said this man said that he can
[1:33:53] destroy this temple in three days raise
[1:33:55] it up
[1:33:57] did he say it yeah
[1:33:59] but that's not what he meant
[1:34:03] so they do the same thing to the message
[1:34:05] they'll come in there
[1:34:06] and they'll twist
[1:34:09] what the prophet said
[1:34:11] they they'll twist because you know the
[1:34:13] Bible said that in his first second
[1:34:15] Peter right in there he said the Bible
[1:34:17] is of no private interpretation
[1:34:20] what does that mean that means that it
[1:34:22] cannot be isolated
[1:34:24] you look that up in the Scofield it
[1:34:26] means it's got to be continuity from
[1:34:27] start to finish he's got to weave in and
[1:34:29] out in and out
[1:34:32] destroy this Temple and in three days
[1:34:35] I'll raise it up
[1:34:38] so after all that we come to
[1:34:40] the original text the original title of
[1:34:43] this sermon
[1:34:45] what will you do
[1:34:48] with this word called the message
[1:34:52] Jesus
[1:34:54] is on the hands of the world
[1:34:58] he's hung the hands of every person
[1:35:02] and a decision must be made
[1:35:06] remember the anointed word is Jesus
[1:35:08] Christ
[1:35:09] and Christ has unveiled himself
[1:35:12] before a wide and wandering eyes in this
[1:35:14] end time
[1:35:16] so we have a choice there's Jesus
[1:35:20] the anointed word who did nothing but
[1:35:22] heal the sick did nothing but cast out
[1:35:24] devils
[1:35:25] was God in flesh the word made manifest
[1:35:30] and on this side you have Barabbas
[1:35:34] he was a murderer
[1:35:37] he was a thief
[1:35:40] he committed an Insurrection you know
[1:35:41] some Rebellion against Rome or something
[1:35:43] that got somebody killed
[1:35:47] and a choice had to be made
[1:35:51] you say
[1:35:53] Barabbas
[1:35:54] is anything other
[1:35:57] than the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:00] Barabbas can be the world
[1:36:03] Barabbas can be a relationship that
[1:36:04] would pull you away from God Barabbas
[1:36:07] can be friendships Barabbas can be a
[1:36:09] career to pull you out of church name it
[1:36:10] anything
[1:36:12] I don't know what you're going through
[1:36:14] but he knows
[1:36:16] but before you you have the anointed
[1:36:18] word
[1:36:19] and you have a Barabbas
[1:36:22] and a decision has got to be made
[1:36:26] what will I do with Jesus called Christ
[1:36:29] pilate said he had been placed on his
[1:36:31] hands the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:36:33] placed again on the hands of this
[1:36:35] congregation it's placed on the hands of
[1:36:38] this nation and around the world where
[1:36:40] these tapes has been and the things has
[1:36:42] been Vindicated and proven by God of God
[1:36:45] now what will we do with this Jesus
[1:36:47] that's called the same yesterday today
[1:36:50] and forever
[1:36:51] what will we do with his Jesus
[1:36:55] are you ready to take your place at his
[1:36:57] side
[1:37:00] the prophet's nailing it down
[1:37:02] to an entire generation
[1:37:07] this is preached in 1963 years and years
[1:37:10] and years this the word had been
[1:37:13] properly Vindicated Vindicated miracles
[1:37:14] signs of Wonders unexplainable
[1:37:17] the word had been preached
[1:37:20] in the world had to make a decision now
[1:37:23] Paula he tried three different ways to
[1:37:26] get Jesus off of his hands
[1:37:29] he tried to wash
[1:37:32] Jesus off of his hands remember he said
[1:37:35] I find no fault in him
[1:37:37] so you see it's not enough that we just
[1:37:38] don't find a fault with the word the
[1:37:40] word I believe it that's right the the
[1:37:43] word is spotless man I tell you what I
[1:37:46] felt chills in service and it's
[1:37:47] wonderful and I can't find no fault in
[1:37:49] this word
[1:37:51] I can't find no fault
[1:37:53] but you don't take your place by him
[1:37:57] you don't exactly choose them
[1:37:59] which you find no fault
[1:38:01] you can't wash your hands that's trying
[1:38:04] to wash your hands
[1:38:07] so he even tried after that he tried to
[1:38:09] wash his hands
[1:38:12] but he couldn't
[1:38:15] you can't get Jesus off your hands by
[1:38:17] washing him off
[1:38:19] by just pushing it off
[1:38:23] so as I said just because we've got to
[1:38:25] not only just because you recognize
[1:38:27] there's something to the word but you're
[1:38:28] trying to wash your hands of a true
[1:38:31] born-again experience
[1:38:34] is doing the same thing
[1:38:37] the second thing pilate tried to do is
[1:38:39] he tried to pass Jesus song for someone
[1:38:41] else to deal with
[1:38:43] remember he sent him to Herod and Herod
[1:38:45] you know he heard a lot about Jesus he
[1:38:46] actually wanted to be entertained by him
[1:38:47] he said you know do a trick
[1:38:50] and you find people with the same Spirit
[1:38:52] they want to be entertained
[1:38:55] entertain me in some way
[1:38:59] so pilate tried to push him to Herod
[1:39:02] pass the buck as it was
[1:39:05] to try and let someone else deal with
[1:39:06] Jesus
[1:39:08] but we've all got to deal with Jesus
[1:39:12] because remember Jesus said to whom much
[1:39:14] is given
[1:39:16] much is required
[1:39:18] so what what does that mean well if
[1:39:21] you're if if we know about the message
[1:39:24] and God has blessed us Beyond there's no
[1:39:26] other greater blessing than to know this
[1:39:29] truth there's no other blessing there's
[1:39:31] no greater blessing I mean to say
[1:39:34] so it's not just enough to know that
[1:39:38] you can't just
[1:39:40] pass it off
[1:39:42] we all have to deal with it God gave us
[1:39:44] this truth and now God's going to
[1:39:47] require
[1:39:49] it of us
[1:39:52] so he tried to pass them to Herod when
[1:39:53] we try to pass them to Herod what did he
[1:39:55] do it came right back to him
[1:39:58] people try and Pat try and pass the word
[1:40:00] around well I'm not going to serve God
[1:40:02] until my wife believes it where I'm not
[1:40:04] going to serve God to my husband does or
[1:40:06] to my kids or I'm not I'm not going to
[1:40:07] serve God until maybe after I graduate
[1:40:10] college or maybe when I get here when I
[1:40:11] get married this message is for old
[1:40:13] people no this message is for young it's
[1:40:16] for middle age it's for old from Cradle
[1:40:18] to Gray from Cradle to Glory
[1:40:21] this message is for you don't let Satan
[1:40:24] tell you and try and get you to push
[1:40:27] this message off to push a born-again
[1:40:30] experience off to push a pillar of fire
[1:40:33] experience off to some other time
[1:40:38] don't do like pilot
[1:40:43] because it's going to come right back in
[1:40:44] our lap
[1:40:46] we try and push and wait
[1:40:49] and push it off and give excuses it's
[1:40:51] it's not going to work
[1:40:54] so the third thing was pilate was forced
[1:40:58] to make a decision
[1:41:01] we're forced to make a decision
[1:41:03] at some point in our lives even you
[1:41:05] that's been even you that's born again
[1:41:07] on your way to heaven and filled with
[1:41:08] the Holy Ghost at some point in your
[1:41:10] life we were forced to make a decision
[1:41:13] because as Sinners we have Jesus Christ
[1:41:16] in our hands
[1:41:19] because your sin
[1:41:21] and my sin killed them
[1:41:24] in a nutshell
[1:41:26] your sins and my sins kill the Prince of
[1:41:30] Life
[1:41:31] so we have the blood of Jesus on our
[1:41:33] hands
[1:41:34] we come to this world speaking lies
[1:41:37] we have a thirst for the things of the
[1:41:39] world we have a thirst for the things we
[1:41:40] are natural tendencies to run
[1:41:43] from God
[1:41:46] but there Comes A Time
[1:41:48] where you have got to make a decision
[1:41:52] you can't wash your hands you can't push
[1:41:54] it for another day you can't push it for
[1:41:56] no other excuse you've got to bring it
[1:41:58] home you either accept it
[1:42:01] or you reject it
[1:42:05] now there is still Mercy
[1:42:08] and he stands before you
[1:42:11] as the perfect proven Vindicated word of
[1:42:15] God
[1:42:16] yeah he's beaten
[1:42:18] yeah he's got the crown of thorns yeah
[1:42:20] he's got handfuls of beard jerked out of
[1:42:23] his face
[1:42:24] yeah he's mocked he's made fun of and
[1:42:27] all these other things
[1:42:29] but he's still the Vindicated word
[1:42:32] He's Still the Lamb of God he's still
[1:42:34] that wounded dove
[1:42:36] remember brother I'm telling the story I
[1:42:38] think it was in World War One or World
[1:42:39] War II might have been World War one
[1:42:40] they had the pigeons they had the
[1:42:42] messenger pigeons and they were they
[1:42:44] were bound down and they were they were
[1:42:45] kind of their position was coming under
[1:42:46] heavy enemy fire
[1:42:48] and they needed some reinforcements so
[1:42:50] they got this little message and they
[1:42:51] told them their position or what they
[1:42:52] needed or whatever it was and they put
[1:42:54] it in this pigeon and they sent this
[1:42:55] Dove off well the enemy knew the tactics
[1:42:58] they no doubt did the same thing but
[1:43:00] they seen this dove fly from the enemy
[1:43:02] so they begin to then turn all their
[1:43:04] guns
[1:43:06] on this heavenly messenger
[1:43:09] and they begin to shoot and shoot and
[1:43:11] shoot and shoot
[1:43:13] and this Dove got shot in the wing and
[1:43:15] got got shot in the leg or got shot in
[1:43:18] different areas of the body and it was a
[1:43:19] wounded dove
[1:43:21] but the dove kept flying and kept flying
[1:43:24] it kept flying it kept flying because it
[1:43:26] had a a it was like a homing pigeon and
[1:43:29] it had to get home it had a message to
[1:43:31] deliver
[1:43:33] it had a message to deliver and when it
[1:43:36] actually made it to the Americans on the
[1:43:38] other side that had the ability to sit
[1:43:39] in reinforcements it arrived a broken
[1:43:42] wounded beaten dove
[1:43:45] but the message got through
[1:43:48] the message got through and the
[1:43:51] Americans sent reinforcements there and
[1:43:52] they pushed back the enemy because the
[1:43:55] message of a wounded dove
[1:43:58] it was a wounded dove two thousand years
[1:44:00] ago
[1:44:01] and that wounded dove he like I said he
[1:44:04] was just so beaten and you think that
[1:44:06] the population you know of that day they
[1:44:08] actually chose that would be like
[1:44:10] choosing like a serial killer or
[1:44:12] choosing you know a pedophile or
[1:44:14] something
[1:44:16] choosing a convict
[1:44:20] guilty of death
[1:44:23] and rejecting the Prince of Life
[1:44:26] all because of religious bias
[1:44:29] so there he stands with the crown of
[1:44:31] thorn beaten beyond all recognition
[1:44:35] and the people had to make a choice
[1:44:40] and as I said he stands before you the
[1:44:42] perfect proven Vindicated word
[1:44:46] and we have to make a choice
[1:44:48] just because the world is crucifying him
[1:44:51] afresh doesn't mean you have to
[1:44:55] just because the world is still beating
[1:44:57] this word just because the world is
[1:44:59] still mocking and spitting and hating
[1:45:01] the word doesn't mean you have to
[1:45:04] because even in Jesus's first
[1:45:06] crucifixion there were people there the
[1:45:08] disciples that could see who he was
[1:45:12] and it hurt them it just tore their
[1:45:14] heart out to see what he had to go
[1:45:16] through
[1:45:19] but he did it for them
[1:45:22] the only way to get Jesus Christ off
[1:45:25] your hands
[1:45:26] is to accept him
[1:45:29] wash and don't take them off
[1:45:31] pushing them down the road pushing
[1:45:34] pushing him away to someone else and
[1:45:36] making excuses that does not get him off
[1:45:38] of your hands
[1:45:40] but do you know something as simple as
[1:45:42] receiving him does
[1:45:45] receiving and accepting him then it goes
[1:45:48] from your hands
[1:45:50] to your heart
[1:45:52] and when it's in your heart
[1:45:55] that's where the mercy is
[1:45:58] he's here's the only thing we can do
[1:46:01] if you cannot wash him off your hands
[1:46:03] you can't pass him on to somebody else
[1:46:06] you can't just mythically pass it by
[1:46:08] there's no way in the world the only
[1:46:10] thing you can do
[1:46:12] is accepted
[1:46:14] in your heart
[1:46:16] there's no way to get rid of him take
[1:46:19] him off your hands and put them in your
[1:46:20] heart
[1:46:21] or leave him on your hands and stand the
[1:46:24] judgment
[1:46:25] that's the only thing you can do let's
[1:46:29] stand to our feet tonight
[1:46:30] the musicians will come
[1:46:35] this message is the truth
[1:46:39] this message is Jesus Christ the same
[1:46:40] yesterday
[1:46:42] and forever
[1:46:45] the anointed word and it's rejected has
[1:46:47] been Vindicated and these were just some
[1:46:50] a few points you you can go on and on
[1:46:52] and on
[1:46:53] about the Vindication of the word in
[1:46:55] this hour
[1:46:57] but you know
[1:46:59] you know we hear the tapes and and you
[1:47:01] hear the prayer lines
[1:47:03] and you a lot of times I even will
[1:47:05] identify myself with the prayer line
[1:47:09] it's on the tape and you identify
[1:47:10] yourself somebody's coming in for
[1:47:12] something or maybe you have a loved one
[1:47:13] with that situation and you identify
[1:47:15] there's power in that
[1:47:19] and God would vindicate his word before
[1:47:21] man over
[1:47:23] and over and over again
[1:47:27] but do you know the greatest vindication
[1:47:31] of this message
[1:47:33] is you
[1:47:36] because you are the the manifestation of
[1:47:39] this hour
[1:47:41] God sent a prophet
[1:47:43] and we believe that with all of our
[1:47:45] hearts
[1:47:47] and he sent him with a message and he
[1:47:49] did well done
[1:47:51] we respect that man and we respect the
[1:47:53] office and we'll always have that
[1:47:55] association with him on the other side
[1:47:57] but you know whenever
[1:47:59] Ellie's are bright Rebecca
[1:48:02] [Music]
[1:48:06] and she was on this camera
[1:48:08] they were coming along
[1:48:10] there was Isaac
[1:48:12] the Bible said he was meditating in the
[1:48:14] in the field in the evening time
[1:48:18] and whenever Isaac
[1:48:20] whenever Rebecca had identified that's
[1:48:22] my Isaac
[1:48:25] Eliza job was done
[1:48:28] Ellie's are well done thou good and
[1:48:30] faithful servant
[1:48:32] you brought Rebecca to Isaac
[1:48:35] but you know now it became such an
[1:48:37] intimate love affair
[1:48:39] between Rebecca
[1:48:41] and Isaac
[1:48:45] not you know I know I know people are
[1:48:47] streaming everywhere and I know that
[1:48:49] this may be kind of a different kind of
[1:48:50] sermon
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:48:54] and you may think you know and maybe no
[1:48:57] one here
[1:48:58] maybe that I'd put too much emphasis on
[1:49:01] brother Brandon this this evening
[1:49:03] [Music]
[1:49:04] but don't think that
[1:49:06] [Music]
[1:49:08] he introduced us
[1:49:10] to Jesus Christ the word
[1:49:14] we're here right now
[1:49:17] many of us are married to who we're
[1:49:19] married to
[1:49:20] many of us live where we live
[1:49:22] our lives are so intertwined
[1:49:24] [Music]
[1:49:26] because he left his home
[1:49:29] you know us with little children it
[1:49:31] would just to have to leave home with
[1:49:33] your kids crying Daddy please don't go
[1:49:36] [Music]
[1:49:38] but they'll but you know maybe there was
[1:49:40] a woman in Memphis that was praying
[1:49:43] maybe there was a little old lady
[1:49:45] somewhere just a nobody to the world
[1:49:46] that was praying God sent a Revival to
[1:49:49] my city
[1:49:51] and God had his Prophet go
[1:49:53] and he preached horse
[1:49:56] tired sick
[1:49:58] so we can have this message
[1:50:00] [Music]
[1:50:03] so we can know what true reality is
[1:50:06] so we can know who Jesus really is
[1:50:11] we're not worshiping the god of a Manger
[1:50:13] we're not even during Christmas time
[1:50:15] it's a day of worship we worship what
[1:50:18] God is now
[1:50:19] [Music]
[1:50:21] we don't just we don't worship God on a
[1:50:23] crucifix
[1:50:24] [Music]
[1:50:26] and he pay that price
[1:50:28] but God wants to live in you
[1:50:34] God wants to live in you and he's made
[1:50:37] it so he's put us where he put all that
[1:50:39] all the nation of Israel
[1:50:42] he knew what they would do
[1:50:44] you know when he was in polished
[1:50:45] judgment Hall there came a point to
[1:50:47] where he would quit talking
[1:50:50] all that preaching all that teaching but
[1:50:53] there came a time where the word was
[1:50:54] already spoken people have already made
[1:50:57] their decisions
[1:50:59] Jesus Christ the anointed word stands
[1:51:02] before us
[1:51:05] and I ask you
[1:51:07] what will you do
[1:51:13] not brother Ron
[1:51:15] not brother Andrew
[1:51:18] not my neighbor not my parents not my
[1:51:20] mom not my dad not my children but what
