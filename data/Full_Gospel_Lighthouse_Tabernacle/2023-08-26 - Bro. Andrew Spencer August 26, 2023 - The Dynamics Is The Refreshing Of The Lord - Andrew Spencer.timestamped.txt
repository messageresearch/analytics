[21:39] turnout I mean you can't do you couldn't
[21:42] do this I mean we could but man when you
[21:44] got plenty of help and I know everybody
[21:46] can't be here I know people's got to
[21:48] work brother Shannon's got to work I
[21:50] know I just called him out but I know
[21:51] other people's got to work you got other
[21:53] appointments you know I mean if we try
[21:55] to schedule it when everybody could be
[21:56] here we never would get it scheduled so
[21:58] but I'm so proud of these young guys
[22:01] that showed up hey I'd start that's the
[22:03] Next Generation here at the church that
[22:04] takes over here you know I mean I'm just
[22:07] I mean so you know you know brother
[22:09] Branham says make a comment says that
[22:12] you know you go into the church and
[22:13] watch them watch the pastor way he acts
[22:16] you know you'll see the way the people
[22:18] Acts you know we've just caught the
[22:20] spirit of the preachers for the last 50
[22:22] years they work we work I mean that's
[22:25] the way we do around here you know
[22:27] that's just I mean that's just you know
[22:29] that if you want to see where it's at
[22:30] that's in uh 10 24 50 uh forward the
[22:33] unpardoned sins
[22:35] so you can look it up but we just caught
[22:38] the spirit of our pastors here for the
[22:39] last 50 years we talked about the
[22:40] 50-year Jubilee coming
[22:42] for the last 50 years our pastors had
[22:45] showed us how to work sort of like
[22:46] Andrew said you know about that woman
[22:48] going down there and said she got the
[22:49] holy ghost at church and he said you
[22:52] didn't get it here well if you lazy you
[22:54] didn't get it here
[23:06] just some reminders for the Revival I
[23:09] think we you know we could be crowded we
[23:12] might not be but if you come to make
[23:14] sure if you want your seat you need to
[23:15] come here early we're not saving seats
[23:18] for nobody and then if you get here two
[23:21] hours early
[23:22] and you walk outside for an hour and a
[23:24] half
[23:25] we're not intentionally giving you seat
[23:26] up but you could lose it the only seats
[23:29] we're saving is for the musicians and
[23:30] the people Thomas TJ whoever's parking
[23:33] and doing that we will try to save their
[23:35] seats and it has been a thing I I gave
[23:37] sister Deborah Watson she'd seen a few
[23:40] years ago was accident I didn't
[23:41] intentionally do it but somebody came in
[23:43] and I gave her I mean it happens we're
[23:46] not doing it intentionally but please
[23:48] don't if you come here and don't put
[23:50] stuff out on your seat just come in and
[23:51] read your Bible pray get ready for the
[23:54] service that's what we're here for not
[23:55] not to you know that's just be
[23:58] respectful come in sit down don't be
[24:01] moving around talking and we're not you
[24:04] know we just want to try to do the right
[24:06] things
[24:11] while we're there too the services
[24:13] starts Friday at
[24:15] at six
[24:17] seven
[24:18] Saturday at six Sunday at 11.
[24:22] got it
[24:25] seven six eleven not ten two four
[24:28] okay
[24:31] so you know so if we come in see I mean
[24:35] I use Isaac Zoe they don't need two
[24:38] cheers I mean if we get crowded we don't
[24:41] they don't need two chairs to sit in so
[24:42] you know Anna and Doug they only sitting
[24:45] in a chair and a half now so I mean so
[24:48] so so I mean so we don't we're not we're
[24:51] not
[24:52] we're not we don't want it we're trying
[24:54] to save on many seats as we can I mean
[24:57] prime example brother Williams boys I
[24:59] mean they don't need three chairs they
[25:00] can sit probably on two chairs you know
[25:02] I'm just just using it for example so if
[25:05] if you can if we get crowded and we need
[25:08] we're just trying to make sure that we
[25:10] can make sure that we got everybody
[25:13] um
[25:20] so just another reminder too about the
[25:23] nursery the nursery downstairs is for
[25:25] the Sisters the upstairs is for the
[25:28] brothers
[25:28] also keep in mind Brothers tried to keep
[25:31] your babies
[25:32] uh under control when they're in there
[25:35] some of the older ones don't let them be
[25:37] running around because someone with
[25:38] infants are trying to get their kid to
[25:40] go back to sleep or try to get them calm
[25:41] down so that they want to come back out
[25:43] so they can be in the service they don't
[25:44] want to be sitting back in two buck two
[25:47] uh the services coming or they want to
[25:49] they want to be out here where where the
[25:51] stuff is going on so they don't they
[25:53] want to they want to feel the same thing
[25:54] you feel it so so if you got kids try to
[25:58] if they're in that Nursery if they get
[26:00] if they are older kids and they get to
[26:01] acting up I mean you can always take
[26:03] them outside and take them to the car
[26:05] until they get calm down to try not to
[26:07] be running in and out just be respectful
[26:09] to everybody that's around you
[26:12] uh we also as we
[26:15] typically do we handing out snack bags
[26:17] usually one night so just a reminder
[26:19] don't be bringing it back into the
[26:22] sanctuary or the vest of you just don't
[26:24] bring nothing back into the church you
[26:27] know this is not a place to eat this is
[26:29] you know if you if your kids need to eat
[26:31] I mean most of them if they get on up in
[26:33] age we shouldn't be they shouldn't be
[26:35] needing to eat anything I'm not talking
[26:37] about infants or smaller kids talk about
[26:39] older kids just try to respect the house
[26:42] of the Lord as as it's not the place you
[26:46] know it talks about that in First
[26:48] Corinthians 11. you know you got homes
[26:50] to eat in not church to eat in so
[26:53] um and just make sure you watch your
[26:55] kids I mean it's tight outside the
[26:58] parents it's it's your responsibility to
[27:01] keep up with your kids now we're heading
[27:03] to some tough stuff here so hang on and
[27:06] pray for me here so
[27:09] um so
[27:11] talking and moving around as we come
[27:13] into the sanctuary
[27:15] best of you please please be respectful
[27:18] I mean not just tonight tomorrow night
[27:20] next week it should be every time I mean
[27:22] as you come in you know we got we got an
[27:25] ice porch you can stand there and talk
[27:26] to and probably the people that you're
[27:28] talking to you've talked to all week
[27:30] long you text them all week long it's
[27:31] not that important that you need to walk
[27:33] around and and talk to them it's just
[27:36] we're trying to keep the spirit in right
[27:39] we don't want to do nothing to hinder
[27:40] the spirit so so just just come into the
[27:44] sanctuary get your Bibles read pray and
[27:46] get and get your mind upon the Lord
[27:49] so so saying that too is so so I I I'm
[27:53] pretty sure that they will be showing
[27:55] the video of maybe some stuff over the
[27:57] last 50 years
[27:59] so you know we're just trying to make
[28:01] make sure
[28:02] you know that that if you see my great
[28:06] great uncle Elmore up there that was
[28:09] there 49 years ago
[28:11] he didn't got to say oh there's Uncle
[28:13] Elmore
[28:14] I mean because 99 of people in here
[28:16] don't know my great uncle
[28:18] I've just used that for example I don't
[28:20] have a married uncle but I mean so if
[28:22] you see if you see if you see brother
[28:24] Homer up there you can say oh there's
[28:25] brother Homer I mean if if they was
[28:29] needing a public address announcer or a
[28:32] commentator they would have asked you to
[28:34] feel me to do that on the film here so
[28:37] please please eliminate your comments
[28:39] not only during this video but anytime
[28:42] you know so we're just trying to I mean
[28:46] it people people don't want to hear
[28:48] you know everybody's comments you want
[28:50] to say Amen praise the Lord jump up down
[28:53] and Shout that's fine but we don't need
[28:55] to be making comments about stuff all
[28:57] the time it's just not the right thing
[28:59] to do
[29:01] um so so just just I want to make sure
[29:05] that we're we're coming under right
[29:06] spirit and do the right things as we do
[29:09] that also

[52:18] chapter 3 after that and then also
[52:20] Revelations chapter six amen Isaiah
[52:23] chapter 28 and verse 10. for precept
[52:27] must be upon precept precept on precept
[52:30] line upon line line up online and hear a
[52:33] little and they're a little for with
[52:34] stammering lips and another tongue will
[52:37] he speak to this people to whom he said
[52:39] this is the rest wherewith you may cause
[52:42] the weary to rest and this is the
[52:46] refreshing yet they would not hear Acts
[52:49] chapter 3 and verse 19.
[52:56] Acts chapter 3 and verse 19.
[53:01] the Bible says here
[53:04] repent ye therefore and be converted
[53:07] that your sins may be blotted out when
[53:10] the times of refreshing shall come from
[53:13] the presence of the Lord I want you to
[53:15] pay very close attention where this
[53:16] refreshing is coming from it's coming
[53:19] from the presence of the Lord and He
[53:23] Shall send Jesus Christ which before was
[53:25] preached unto you whom the Heaven Must
[53:28] receive unto the times of restitution of
[53:31] all things which God has spoken by the
[53:34] mouth of all his holy prophets since the
[53:38] world began also Revelations chapter 6
[53:41] and verse 5.
[53:47] foreign
[53:54] Revelations chapter 6 and verse 5.
[53:57] and the Bible said in and when he had
[54:00] opened the third seal and I heard the
[54:03] third Beast say come and see and I'll be
[54:06] held and lower Black Horse and he that
[54:08] sat on him had a pair of balances in his
[54:12] hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of
[54:15] the four beasts say a measure of wheat
[54:16] for a penny and three measures of barley
[54:19] for a penny and see thou hurt not the
[54:22] oil and the wine may God bless his word
[54:25] he may be seated here in the presence of
[54:26] the Lord
[54:28] by the help of the Lord I'd like to
[54:30] speak to you a thought that that the
[54:32] Lord's been dealing with me on I've been
[54:34] I've been studying over these things and
[54:36] preparing our hearts for for these
[54:38] meetings but tonight I'd like to take a
[54:40] thought
[54:41] and the Lord's been dealing with me even
[54:43] in the back office just placing these
[54:45] things together but I'd like to speak to
[54:47] you tonight on the Dynamics is the
[54:50] refreshing from the Lord the Dynamics is
[54:53] the refreshing and we realize as the
[54:56] Church of the Living God that we are
[54:58] living in a very special hour We're
[55:00] living here where we're watching the
[55:02] very manifestations of the the Bible
[55:05] come into coming to pass right in here
[55:08] right in our lives not just something
[55:11] that we could say that we would see back
[55:13] in days gone by but we are watching the
[55:15] very word of the Living God come into
[55:18] action right into our brothers and our
[55:21] sisters people that we have
[55:22] fellowshipped with people that we have
[55:24] known for our lives but what we are
[55:26] watching is an infusion of power to the
[55:30] body of Jesus Christ and we recognize
[55:32] that the brother Brandon would say these
[55:34] things he said now he said this is not
[55:36] Wesley's day it's not Luther's day he
[55:38] said but he said even this is not even
[55:40] the restoration of gifts he said but
[55:42] this is a bride time this is the
[55:45] astronaut age you would say it's the
[55:47] Golden Age It's the bride's time it's
[55:49] the bride age and we recognize as a
[55:51] Church of the Living God that we're
[55:52] living in such a special spot that
[55:55] people have never under throughout 6 000
[55:58] years Humanity has never lived in the
[56:01] place that they're living in and even we
[56:03] sitting here as Believers of the message
[56:05] of the hour we recognize that we're
[56:07] setting in such a very special spot
[56:09] because we we understand but yet there's
[56:12] been a progression of faith and a
[56:14] progression of Revelation that we we
[56:16] have never been where we've been sitting
[56:18] at in this hour that we're living in and
[56:21] I'll just say it like this is that the
[56:23] body of Jesus Christ has had everything
[56:25] that that was on her that was laid back
[56:28] there throughout all those Church ages
[56:30] everything that has been on the Church
[56:32] of the Living God has been released so
[56:35] the body can soar into the heavenlies
[56:37] like never before and I'll say that that
[56:39] what the prophet would tell us is that
[56:41] that what the seals did it ripped the
[56:44] restraining powers of Satan off of the
[56:47] body of Jesus Christ and it's a
[56:49] wonderful thing to know that we're not
[56:51] just looking for for prophecy or we're
[56:53] not just sitting here looking at
[56:55] prophecy but we're sitting here and
[56:57] we're looking at the realities of the
[56:59] word of God and I think it's an amazing
[57:01] time to to recognize that the time that
[57:04] is at hand that John was looking at is
[57:06] that we are there right now now brother
[57:09] Brandon would say this in the third seal
[57:11] he said when I see that God promised to
[57:13] do a certain thing in this day when he
[57:16] promised to break off these seals in
[57:17] this last day he said you don't know the
[57:20] joy the glory when I see him reveal this
[57:22] and stand there and watch it happen and
[57:25] he said and know that I'll take any
[57:27] person to charge he never did say one
[57:29] thing to us but what happened that way
[57:31] and then to see the joy that's in my
[57:33] heart when I see his promise for this
[57:36] last day as he promised to do it as I
[57:38] hear and hear I see it Vindicated to me
[57:40] perfectly right he said you hear me say
[57:43] I feel religious he said oh he said
[57:45] that's what's the matter the stimulation
[57:48] is so bad that I just I'm just about
[57:50] ready to go to cutting up you know
[57:51] stimulation from Revelation so so we
[57:55] stimulated in his heart because of the
[57:57] Revelation he said they become so
[58:00] stimulated talking about the book of
[58:01] Acts and over the Revelation that they'd
[58:04] Vindicated the promise they become so
[58:06] stimulated over the Revelation that
[58:09] they've Vindicated the promise you see
[58:11] when you recognize your portion of
[58:13] scripture that you are the people that
[58:16] is there to vindicate the promise of the
[58:18] hour it'll cause a stimulation to break
[58:21] out he said he said they become so
[58:23] stimulated over the Revelation that
[58:25] they've indicated the promise now oh my
[58:27] they broke out the joy of stimulation
[58:29] till people said that they were drunk on
[58:32] new wine he said when God revealed his
[58:34] promise to them and not only did it
[58:36] reveal it to them but he proved it
[58:38] he didn't just reveal it to him but he
[58:40] proved it and he said that's what I've
[58:42] always said a man can say anything he
[58:45] can just he's just apt to say anything
[58:46] he said but when God comes around and
[58:49] vindicates that you see this age that
[58:51] brother Brandon would tell us in in in
[58:53] God of the evil age he said we find that
[58:56] this evil age is to prove to Satan that
[58:59] she is not like Eve she's not that type
[59:01] of woman so God caused this age to prove
[59:05] to Satan that you're not that kind of a
[59:07] woman William Brandon would say that you
[59:09] have been predestinated not to fall you
[59:12] have been predestinated not to fail you
[59:15] are not that kind of woman you don't
[59:17] have that kind of give up on the inside
[59:18] of you you don't have that kind of
[59:20] failing mentality on the inside of you
[59:22] but where we are as a Church of the
[59:24] Living God we recognize that this is the
[59:27] hour of the manifestations of the Son of
[59:30] God and brother Brandon would tell us in
[59:32] the adoption series he said there's
[59:33] coming a time when the power of God will
[59:35] walk out there and take every Power away
[59:38] from Satan and I want you to know this
[59:40] that God has Vindicated that that that
[59:43] quote right there over and over and over
[59:46] again Paul would say that our gospel
[59:48] came not unto you in word only but it
[59:51] came into you power and it came in
[59:53] demonstrations what happened down there
[59:55] with Georgie Carter there was a man of
[59:58] God that walked out there and took every
[1:00:00] Power away from Satan what happened out
[1:00:02] there with Congress and Upshaw when he'd
[1:00:05] been an invalid for 66 years there was a
[1:00:08] Son of God that had a vision and by the
[1:00:10] vision of the Lord there was a man that
[1:00:12] stood there he wasn't crippled in all of
[1:00:14] his conditions he was crippled up
[1:00:16] sitting there in a wheelchair but yet
[1:00:18] there was a man that had a vision and it
[1:00:21] took the very every Power away from
[1:00:23] Satan I'll say this that there is a
[1:00:26] people in the land who under their
[1:00:28] Messenger will will be the final voice
[1:00:31] to the final age and it's not it's not
[1:00:34] something that is above us it is
[1:00:36] something that is in the Church of the
[1:00:38] Living God and that is exactly what is
[1:00:40] happening right here right now in the
[1:00:43] hour of restoration it is a people that
[1:00:46] are taking the very power away from
[1:00:49] Satan what is it it is the refreshing of
[1:00:52] the Dynamics you see throughout all the
[1:00:54] ages they have the mechanics of it but
[1:00:56] now there is there is a octane power
[1:00:59] there is a spark that is upon that that
[1:01:02] is upon the Dynamics that is upon the
[1:01:04] mechanics that everything that has been
[1:01:06] laying there is going to be made full
[1:01:08] proof I want you to know there's not one
[1:01:11] scripture that is to this Gentile bride
[1:01:13] that she doesn't have access to there's
[1:01:16] not one power that is with restrained
[1:01:19] from the Church of the Living God
[1:01:20] there's not one joy that this bride
[1:01:23] cannot have there's not one shout
[1:01:25] there's not one stimulation there's not
[1:01:27] one Revelation that is given to the
[1:01:29] Church of the Living God under Malachi 4
[1:01:31] that she cannot attain and she can press
[1:01:34] her way into that I know it's a battle
[1:01:36] to get there but it's worth the fight to
[1:01:38] get to a spot that you can do all things
[1:01:41] are possible to them that believe you've
[1:01:43] got to really fight for it you've got to
[1:01:45] press the battle but I really believe
[1:01:47] that this is a worthy cause
[1:01:50] I believe it's a word they call
[1:01:51] suppression to the refreshing of the
[1:01:53] Dynamics of the Lord I'll tell you I'll
[1:01:56] tell you that laodicea has so many
[1:01:58] things that it Stacks up against us that
[1:02:00] so many politics and so many so many
[1:02:02] dynamics of the world that that mess up
[1:02:05] your mind sometimes I tell you we need a
[1:02:07] refreshing
[1:02:08] we need a refreshing from the Lord you
[1:02:11] wake up in the morning and we had rain
[1:02:13] for quite some time but you walk out
[1:02:15] there and there's Dew out there on that
[1:02:16] grass what is it it's a refreshing upon
[1:02:19] that seed even though it's been lacking
[1:02:21] moisture for some time it's that do that
[1:02:24] is keeping it and it's in its state of
[1:02:26] greenness and maybe you've been in a
[1:02:28] spot where you've been dry and you got
[1:02:30] cold and you got stale but let the drew
[1:02:33] the Dew drops of Mercy fall upon your
[1:02:36] heart and renew the very Spirit of your
[1:02:39] soul I believe that it's worth setting
[1:02:42] out there in a time of Peace that's what
[1:02:44] William Bynum would say he said if
[1:02:45] you're going to have a refreshing you've
[1:02:47] got to get to a time where it's peace
[1:02:50] you've got to get to a time of Peace he
[1:02:52] said when does the Dew Drop it drops at
[1:02:55] the Midnight Hour and that's where the
[1:02:57] Church of the Living God is we are in
[1:02:59] the hour where we are asking for a
[1:03:01] refreshing from the presence of the Lord
[1:03:03] Brother Adam said you can't go around
[1:03:05] stewing and fussing and worrying about
[1:03:07] life you'll never get a refreshing that
[1:03:09] way he said but oh if you can just get
[1:03:11] under the presence of the Living God if
[1:03:14] you know you ever had them kind of weeks
[1:03:16] when every every devil in Hell's been
[1:03:18] gunning for you but what you really need
[1:03:21] is a refreshing from the Lord
[1:03:27] you remember Sister Morgan sister Margie
[1:03:29] Morgan that had been diagnosed with
[1:03:31] cancer and the doctors had said that
[1:03:33] that took cancer was wrapped around her
[1:03:35] wrapped around her intestines like a
[1:03:37] roots of a tree that were wrapped around
[1:03:39] her mother Madam said she was sitting
[1:03:41] out there in that stale condition he
[1:03:43] said but we brought her in there behind
[1:03:44] the veil he said we brought her in there
[1:03:46] behind into the presence who to the
[1:03:49] refreshing to the refreshing and brought
[1:03:51] her in there behind the veil he said we
[1:03:53] dropped the curtain down behind her he
[1:03:55] said and behind there you don't care
[1:03:57] what the doctor says no matter what
[1:03:59] anybody else says the veil dropped and
[1:04:02] shut off every unbeliever then she
[1:04:04] reached into that golden pot of God and
[1:04:06] said by his trumps I am healed and she
[1:04:10] started eating from that golden pot and
[1:04:12] if you've not been to a spot where
[1:04:14] you're where you're living in a spot
[1:04:16] where where the rest of the world has
[1:04:17] got your mind got you and this one
[1:04:19] person can upset your whole entire week
[1:04:21] I'd say it's time to let the veil drop
[1:04:24] behind you
[1:04:25] if one person can mess up your week you
[1:04:29] need to get rid of that person if one
[1:04:31] person can take away your spiritual
[1:04:33] attitude walk away from them and leave
[1:04:36] them where they are because behind the
[1:04:38] veil
[1:04:39] it's a soundproof room
[1:04:41] and if you can ever get back Claire
[1:04:44] under the presence of the Shekinah Glory
[1:04:46] you don't care what the doctor says you
[1:04:48] don't care what the criticism comes
[1:04:49] you're back there under the presence of
[1:04:52] the Living God what is it that
[1:04:55] atmosphere that's been created for a
[1:04:57] people to walk back in there where they
[1:05:00] know they are in the presence of el
[1:05:03] shadiah and I believe that it's a
[1:05:04] wonderful thing tonight that you don't
[1:05:06] have to guess and who guess whose
[1:05:08] presence that you're in
[1:05:10] you're not in the presence of a
[1:05:11] politician tonight you're not in the
[1:05:13] presence of an intellectual giant but
[1:05:15] you are in the presence of The Great I
[1:05:18] Am
[1:05:19] it's a wonderful thing the brother
[1:05:20] Brandon would teach us brother Brandon
[1:05:22] would teach us that an atmosphere has
[1:05:24] got to be created for the presence of
[1:05:26] the Lord he said it's the hardest thing
[1:05:28] to do is to get Believers in that kind
[1:05:30] of atmosphere he said but all if the
[1:05:33] atmosphere can get right he said
[1:05:34] there'll be another repeat of Pentecost
[1:05:37] that takes place what is an atmosphere
[1:05:39] it's a condition where the seed can grow
[1:05:42] you see if you've got all the elements
[1:05:44] you've got the seed you got the dirt
[1:05:45] what do you need you need the conditions
[1:05:47] to be right you see because if you don't
[1:05:49] have the conditions right the effects
[1:05:51] won't be upon the seed but oh if you can
[1:05:54] ever get that kind of atmosphere
[1:05:56] oh if you can ever get that kind of
[1:05:58] atmosphere but that's what William
[1:05:59] Brandon would say he said he said now he
[1:06:02] said he said you go back there and you
[1:06:03] look in there when Jesus said when he
[1:06:05] said to them those people that were
[1:06:07] worship Him worshiping him he said in
[1:06:09] vain you do worship me
[1:06:11] by your Traditions you've made the word
[1:06:13] of God no effect so he said he said if I
[1:06:15] taught you a Methodist message he
[1:06:17] wouldn't take no effect upon you why
[1:06:20] because you're not under a Methodist
[1:06:22] message he said oh if Moses would have
[1:06:24] took Noah's message he would have never
[1:06:26] had any effect he said if Jesus Took
[1:06:28] Moses's message he would have never took
[1:06:30] no effect because his seed was
[1:06:32] predestinated for a certain kind of
[1:06:35] water you see you cannot put
[1:06:37] Pentecostalism upon the body of Jesus
[1:06:39] Christ
[1:06:40] because that's not the kind of water
[1:06:42] that we are under but we are under this
[1:06:46] fresh Pentecostal drink all the way back
[1:06:49] to the book of Acts
[1:06:52] and I'll say this it's worth the fight
[1:06:54] to get there
[1:06:56] now notice what the Bible said in
[1:06:57] Ephesians 6 and 10 it says finally my
[1:07:00] brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[1:07:02] the power of His might now watch what
[1:07:05] the passing translation says now my
[1:07:07] beloved ones I have saved these most
[1:07:10] important truths to the last be
[1:07:13] supernaturally infused with strength
[1:07:15] through your life Union with the Lord
[1:07:17] Jesus stand Victorious with the force of
[1:07:20] explosive power flowing in and through
[1:07:23] you so you see if you get outside of
[1:07:25] this message there is no power for you
[1:07:29] lock it or lump it if you get outside of
[1:07:31] this message you say well I'm going back
[1:07:33] to my Bible and I'm going back to this
[1:07:35] if you get outside of this message there
[1:07:38] is no power outside of this message
[1:07:41] you might be able to have healing you
[1:07:43] might be able to have Miracles but you
[1:07:45] will never have an overcoming life
[1:07:47] outside of this message because what you
[1:07:49] are under is a restoration message and
[1:07:52] because there is a restoration it's a
[1:07:54] people hallelujah it's a people that are
[1:07:57] here under restoration hour that's
[1:07:59] giving them the power
[1:08:01] to overcome every day for I'll tell you
[1:08:04] what this message will produce it'll
[1:08:06] produce a body that looks exactly like
[1:08:08] the head and I'll tell you what this
[1:08:10] message will do it'll settle every
[1:08:12] debate of Satan it'll conquer every
[1:08:14] formidable power that comes against the
[1:08:17] Church of the Living God
[1:08:19] oh that's what we need we need a
[1:08:23] refreshing from the Lord
[1:08:26] now notice we realize we realize when we
[1:08:29] look into Revelation chapter 6 that we
[1:08:31] see at the breaking of this third seal
[1:08:33] that they are the Beast which say come
[1:08:36] and see notice it wasn't the lamb but it
[1:08:39] was a beast that said come and see and
[1:08:42] when John went and looked over there to
[1:08:43] see it what did he see he saw it in
[1:08:46] symbol form but when you see the lamb
[1:08:49] breaking the seal in this hour what is
[1:08:52] it the bride doesn't see a symbol but
[1:08:55] she sees what is rightfully revealed to
[1:08:57] the Church of the Living God so you see
[1:08:59] we recognize that there was that
[1:09:01] Antichrist spirit that was riding out in
[1:09:03] the first stage and he rode on through
[1:09:05] and he changed his ministries into the
[1:09:08] red horse we watched it and he changed
[1:09:10] to the Black Horse and what it is it's
[1:09:13] the Antichrist brother Brandon would
[1:09:14] tell us he said now it's the same it's
[1:09:16] the same writer all the time it's the
[1:09:19] same one riding out there notice how he
[1:09:21] came in the first in the first stage
[1:09:23] what did he do he came out there and it
[1:09:25] looked so so close that's why Jesus
[1:09:28] would say in Matthew 24 and 24 that it
[1:09:31] would be so close that it would deceive
[1:09:33] the very elect if it was possible now
[1:09:36] notice they are all the way back there
[1:09:38] in the first stages of the ministry they
[1:09:40] are that Antichrist was working right
[1:09:43] amongst the church he was so close and
[1:09:46] there he came in there with his
[1:09:47] Antichrist doctrines and he was trying
[1:09:49] to make them disbelieve just like he did
[1:09:52] Eve make her fall by one word
[1:09:55] but notice notice what that writer does
[1:09:57] he changes his ministry he changes from
[1:10:01] light to red from red to Black from
[1:10:04] black to pale what is it it's the same
[1:10:07] writer and you see what was writing that
[1:10:09] black horse was riding down through the
[1:10:12] Dark Ages that's what he was going out
[1:10:15] there he was riding in those times it
[1:10:17] was a time where it was midnight to the
[1:10:19] True Believers that was left there
[1:10:21] because it was only a little number she
[1:10:23] only had a little bit of strength but
[1:10:25] there was a little bit of light for them
[1:10:27] believers
[1:10:28] but you see what that what that
[1:10:30] Antichrist Spirit was doing he was
[1:10:32] riding out there and he was trying to
[1:10:34] smother the very life right out of the
[1:10:37] church
[1:10:38] let me tell you something the Antichrist
[1:10:40] is still working in this hour he doesn't
[1:10:43] really care he doesn't really care if
[1:10:46] you Shout Scream and get emotional but
[1:10:48] you ever get into a place where the
[1:10:49] token of the Holy Ghost is
[1:10:53] that's what he's trying to do he's
[1:10:54] trying to smother the very life out of
[1:10:57] the Church of the Living God
[1:10:58] because Satan knows if you got the goods
[1:11:01] or whether you don't you can boo who cry
[1:11:03] wash your makeup off by your tears but
[1:11:06] it doesn't do any good unless you got
[1:11:09] the life and what was this Antichrist
[1:11:11] Spirit trying to do he was trying to
[1:11:13] smother the very life right out of the
[1:11:16] Dark Ages what did he do he left them
[1:11:19] with no hope he left them there all
[1:11:21] their Hope was gone but notice what the
[1:11:23] Bible would say a measure a measure a
[1:11:26] week for a penny and three measures of
[1:11:28] barley for a penny what was it it was
[1:11:31] there that Antichrist under the
[1:11:33] Catholicism therefore there he was
[1:11:36] charging people
[1:11:37] he was charging people for hope
[1:11:40] he was charging them saying that this is
[1:11:43] the only way that you're going to ever
[1:11:44] see your see your young your old you're
[1:11:46] the people that have passed on he was
[1:11:48] charging them what was he charging them
[1:11:51] for he was charging them for the wheat
[1:11:54] and for the barley which is a part of
[1:11:57] the Natural Life of partaking of it you
[1:11:59] see these people were living in an hour
[1:12:01] where there was no hope there was no
[1:12:04] hope all their Hope was gone and here
[1:12:06] Satan was charging them and making them
[1:12:10] think that this was the only way that
[1:12:12] you could have hope
[1:12:13] ain't that exactly how the devil does
[1:12:15] you
[1:12:17] say oh just take a little bit of social
[1:12:19] drink here and I'll give you a little
[1:12:20] bit of happiness he's charging you he's
[1:12:23] charging you for your happiness what
[1:12:25] does he say to you just shake the
[1:12:27] preacher's hand and you're in it and
[1:12:28] yours could eternally secure just sign
[1:12:31] your name here what is it that's that
[1:12:33] same Antichrist writer trying to give
[1:12:35] you hope trying to give you hope in some
[1:12:38] other way which God did not permit
[1:12:41] before the foundation of the world
[1:12:44] but God did not leave them in the
[1:12:46] condition that he found them
[1:12:49] what is it the lamb screamed out what
[1:12:52] was it it was not the Beast it was the
[1:12:55] lamb that's creamed out don't you hurt
[1:12:57] my wine don't you hurt my oil
[1:13:00] yeah it's just a little bit there but
[1:13:02] don't you touch it
[1:13:04] don't you touch it it was not the voice
[1:13:07] of the Beast it was the voice of the
[1:13:09] Lamb what's speaking in this generation
[1:13:11] and saying Satan take your hands off of
[1:13:14] God's Property it's a lamb
[1:13:17] what's being Advanced what's being
[1:13:19] Advanced right now it's the Church of
[1:13:21] the Living God with the lamb that's
[1:13:22] leading her all the way
[1:13:24] let me tell you you can't find no hope
[1:13:26] out there until they ought to see you
[1:13:27] but there is hope in this lamb
[1:13:30] there is hope in this lamb There Is
[1:13:33] Power
[1:13:33] [Applause]
[1:13:37] I want to do the lamb cried out right
[1:13:39] amongst them don't
[1:13:41] hurt the line and the oil that's right
[1:13:44] don't you heard it boy or you're going
[1:13:46] to have to pay for it
[1:13:49] you know good and well by studying the
[1:13:51] message you know what the oil represents
[1:13:53] it represents the Holy Ghost and you
[1:13:55] know about you know by the preaching of
[1:13:57] this message you know what wine
[1:13:59] represents it's Revelation it's
[1:14:01] stimulation by Revelation and maybe
[1:14:04] you're sitting here tonight and you
[1:14:05] don't understand the importance of
[1:14:07] Revelation
[1:14:08] but brother Brandon would tell us the
[1:14:10] the importance of Revelation can never
[1:14:13] be overemphasized to the believer he
[1:14:15] said Revelation means more to you than
[1:14:18] even what you even realize tonight you
[1:14:20] see well I just well I don't really know
[1:14:22] about any Revelations he did any deep
[1:14:24] Revelations that I got brother Andrew
[1:14:26] are you sitting here as a Believer you
[1:14:29] got faith here tonight brother would
[1:14:31] tell us that faith is a revelation but
[1:14:34] what was it here this Revelation was
[1:14:37] give to a people to overcome in the
[1:14:40] worst of times when there was no hope
[1:14:42] there was still hope
[1:14:44] what did Abraham do against hope he
[1:14:47] believed in Hope
[1:14:50] come on you going through some tough
[1:14:51] times in the last little bit but against
[1:14:53] hope you're still here
[1:14:56] against criticism you're still here
[1:14:58] against problems is still here
[1:15:02] well Glory that's what the Bible told on
[1:15:05] Moses told us he said the secret things
[1:15:07] belong to the Lord but the things
[1:15:10] that have been revealed to us belong to
[1:15:14] me and if I know it's got my name on
[1:15:18] let me tell you if I know George got my
[1:15:21] name on it and praise has got my name on
[1:15:23] it and Revelations got my name on it and
[1:15:26] peace has got my name on it there's some
[1:15:28] be the devil that tries to take it away
[1:15:30] from me
[1:15:35] what is it it's a revelation what do you
[1:15:37] worked up about brother Andrew it's a
[1:15:40] revelation it's the Revelation it's the
[1:15:43] Revelation that'll take you higher it's
[1:15:46] well we need somebody's ideas we don't
[1:15:48] need nobody's ideas we got the greatest
[1:15:50] Revelation that there ever has been and
[1:15:53] every devil can't stop the church
[1:15:57] from moving higher in the Realms of
[1:16:00] Jesus Christ this is not the days of
[1:16:02] horse and Buggies this is not the days
[1:16:04] of airplanes this is an astronaut age
[1:16:07] and you have been tossed
[1:16:09] by the Revelation stimulate it
[1:16:13] come on somebody you ain't sitting here
[1:16:15] you ain't sitting here with race car
[1:16:17] fuel you've got rocket fuel in you
[1:16:22] you got rock and fuel in you that's why
[1:16:24] you can believe like you believe
[1:16:26] [Applause]
[1:16:29] well Glory
[1:16:31] well Glory what's Revelation what's
[1:16:34] revelation mean it means wine
[1:16:40] well
[1:16:41] I ain't never been too much of a wino
[1:16:43] but I do know this
[1:16:45] I do know this that wine was not meant
[1:16:47] to stay in bottles
[1:16:52] never did have much of taste for that
[1:16:54] kind of stuff but I do know this that it
[1:16:56] it wasn't just set there so that it
[1:16:59] could stay up on the Shelf the gifts of
[1:17:02] the Holy Ghost were not given to the
[1:17:04] Church of the Living God so that they
[1:17:05] could set up there in the shelf and say
[1:17:07] we don't need those things no more yes I
[1:17:10] believe there's a diversity of gifts but
[1:17:12] if we want a perfect Church to be
[1:17:14] edified by us God has got gifts
[1:17:17] start trying to put the wine upon the
[1:17:19] shelf and say man ain't it pretty man
[1:17:21] ain't it beautiful man it's got the
[1:17:24] oldest date on it let me tell you it's
[1:17:26] time you pop the cork
[1:17:29] it's time you pull it down off the shelf
[1:17:32] start with the lowest gift start
[1:17:34] speaking in tongues start with
[1:17:36] interpretation start with wisdom start
[1:17:39] with faith start with knowledge
[1:17:41] [Applause]
[1:17:42] pull them off the shelf don't look at
[1:17:45] the sticker don't look at the date I say
[1:17:47] that there's some people around the
[1:17:49] message that have never pulled the
[1:17:50] bottle of the shelf and drank of the
[1:17:53] Holy Ghost
[1:17:54] [Applause]
[1:17:58] all right
[1:18:02] hello now come on now that's why that's
[1:18:05] what William Brandon would tell us in
[1:18:07] the unveiling of Christ he said what is
[1:18:09] it we went all the way back in there
[1:18:11] tapped in Hebrews walked all the way
[1:18:14] back in there into the Book of Joel and
[1:18:17] found out that in the last days I will
[1:18:19] pour out my spirit what's brother random
[1:18:21] do he starts breaking into the Greek
[1:18:24] he starts breaking into the Greek and he
[1:18:26] starts telling us of things that a
[1:18:29] hillbilly Kentuckian should know about
[1:18:30] but there was an angel that was pointing
[1:18:33] these things out he said in the last
[1:18:35] days what is it kenosis I will empty
[1:18:38] myself I will pour out myself
[1:18:41] well what is he doing brother Andrew
[1:18:43] he's pouring himself he's pouring the
[1:18:46] revelation of himself right into the
[1:18:49] church
[1:18:51] well if you got him you got everything
[1:18:54] right
[1:18:55] if you got him you got everything right
[1:18:57] notice what the announcement of the Lamb
[1:19:00] was don't touch it don't hurt it don't
[1:19:03] afflict it don't say one thing about it
[1:19:07] now let me tell you something
[1:19:09] a natural lamb may not be who you want
[1:19:12] on your side but this lamb
[1:19:14] Islam fought for you this lamb thought
[1:19:17] that you was worthy this lamb thought
[1:19:19] that you was worth dying for this lamb
[1:19:21] thought that he could put the cross upon
[1:19:23] his back and carry it for you I'd say
[1:19:25] that this lamb is worth following
[1:19:29] come on now you can get upset about
[1:19:31] there and stay back here in your sin all
[1:19:33] you want to but you need this lamb and
[1:19:36] this lamb is announcing to all of hell
[1:19:38] they don't touch my Revelation don't
[1:19:41] touch my holy ghost power
[1:19:45] come on now don't touch it don't hinder
[1:19:48] it the lamb is showing don't you Hut
[1:19:50] don't you touch a holy ghost don't you
[1:19:52] try to explain away the Dynamics of the
[1:19:54] Revelation if you do Satan you're going
[1:19:56] to pay for it
[1:19:58] man you say brother Andrew I'm afraid if
[1:20:00] I if I start shouting or if I start
[1:20:02] dancing I'll get in the flesh
[1:20:05] how'd you get in the building
[1:20:10] come on now how'd you get in the
[1:20:11] building it took your whole flesh to
[1:20:15] come walk in here and put yourself down
[1:20:17] in a Pew it took your flesh to get in
[1:20:19] here it took the song leader in the
[1:20:22] flesh to start singing some songs and it
[1:20:24] broke into a round he was doing it in
[1:20:26] the flesh then all of a sudden the
[1:20:28] spirit of the Lord got to work it don't
[1:20:30] you worry about your flesh your flesh
[1:20:32] will get out of the way
[1:20:37] thank you well I'm worried about it
[1:20:40] brother Andrew I'm really worried about
[1:20:41] it
[1:20:42] okay
[1:20:44] he said now notice where he says this at
[1:20:46] in the fourth seal
[1:20:48] I know now I know there's a lot of
[1:20:50] fanaticism and people carrying on no
[1:20:52] sometimes they do it when they do it
[1:20:55] when the music is jumping and jumping
[1:20:57] that music is jumping up and down and
[1:20:58] everything I know that goes and I
[1:21:00] believe that too but I've seen people in
[1:21:02] the day when as long as the music's
[1:21:04] playing everybody was jumping and
[1:21:05] screaming but when the music stopped it
[1:21:08] stopped you see brother Andrew that's
[1:21:09] exactly what I'm scared of
[1:21:11] I'm afraid if all of a sudden brother
[1:21:14] Andrew or brother Matthew changed his
[1:21:16] song
[1:21:17] I'm afraid that I'll just I'll just be
[1:21:19] in the flesh
[1:21:22] do you want to hear what your Prophet
[1:21:24] said
[1:21:25] he said but I've seen people in the day
[1:21:28] as long as the music's playing everybody
[1:21:29] was jumping and screaming but when the
[1:21:31] music stopped stop well that's
[1:21:34] still all right as far as I'm concerned
[1:21:37] you see as long as people lives right
[1:21:40] let me tell you something as long as you
[1:21:42] got the goods as long as you got the
[1:21:44] token as long as you got the person of
[1:21:46] Christ You Can Dance anytime you want to
[1:21:49] you can shout anytime you want to you
[1:21:51] can scream anytime you want to if you
[1:21:54] got the life to back up the message
[1:21:56] don't you be ashamed don't you be afraid
[1:22:03] brother Brandon said oh we believe in
[1:22:06] heartfelt religion we believe in the
[1:22:08] people's Liberty to be able to say Amen
[1:22:10] to the word of God he said the holy
[1:22:12] spirit will never lead you to do
[1:22:13] anything wrong
[1:22:15] and if he's leading you Jehovah is going
[1:22:17] to lead you all the way
[1:22:22] well
[1:22:23] I'm working on a building I'm working on
[1:22:27] a building I'm working on a building for
[1:22:31] my lord for my lord it's a holy ghost
[1:22:34] build head it's a holy ghost well what
[1:22:37] are you talking about brother Andrew
[1:22:39] that's exactly what William Branham said
[1:22:41] in stature to a perfect man Christ
[1:22:43] didn't send me down here to build some
[1:22:45] institution he sent me to build
[1:22:46] powerhouses and almighty God I believe
[1:22:49] we ought to be powerhouses of joy
[1:22:56] now you can have your seats notice what
[1:22:59] brother random said about the Dynamics
[1:23:00] he said the mechanics he said there's so
[1:23:03] many people trying to explain the
[1:23:04] mechanics he said the only thing he said
[1:23:06] you know the only thing you should know
[1:23:08] he said the mechanics is known he said
[1:23:10] but what if somebody would have said
[1:23:11] Noah I want you to explain the mechanics
[1:23:14] how of how the ark's going to float he
[1:23:16] didn't do it
[1:23:18] you don't have to know the mechanics
[1:23:20] just the Dynamics of it the Dynamics is
[1:23:23] what you want to know well if somebody
[1:23:25] come up to Israel and said say Moses I
[1:23:27] want to understand how you could create
[1:23:29] create animals with your own word he
[1:23:31] said it ain't my word it's God's word he
[1:23:34] told me how to do it how them squirrels
[1:23:36] get created
[1:23:37] how to write Sons get to the place that
[1:23:40] they were at
[1:23:42] it ain't for me to explain it all it is
[1:23:45] for me to believe
[1:23:48] come on now
[1:23:49] again he would say I believe the bride
[1:23:52] of Christ is called I believe that she's
[1:23:54] sealed in the kingdom of God I believe
[1:23:56] the mechanics is here they're waiting
[1:23:58] for the Dynamics that'll take her off
[1:23:59] the earth into the glory into the
[1:24:01] Rapture I believe it with all my heart
[1:24:04] see we don't know how he's going to do
[1:24:06] it but he shall do it he is he is he is
[1:24:11] the Dynamics
[1:24:13] say it to your neighbor he is the
[1:24:15] Dynamics the Dynamics is the refreshing
[1:24:19] he is the Dynamics we just become
[1:24:21] members of the machine of his body
[1:24:23] forming ourselves into his image and see
[1:24:26] him uniting himself with us again he'd
[1:24:29] say the Dynamics of this church will be
[1:24:32] a refilling of the Holy Spirit
[1:24:38] I believe that takes every question on
[1:24:40] what the Dynamics is the Dynamics of
[1:24:42] this church will be a refilling of the
[1:24:45] Holy Spirit Well brother Angel I don't
[1:24:47] know if I can believe that or not I
[1:24:49] don't believe that you're believing the
[1:24:50] message
[1:24:52] well the Dynamics of this church would
[1:24:54] be a refilling of the Holy Spirit he
[1:24:56] said but when that head and that body
[1:24:58] unites together the full power of the
[1:25:00] Holy Ghost would raise her up just
[1:25:02] exactly like that even the Day of the
[1:25:04] Dead that's in Christ for hundreds of
[1:25:06] years ago will rise in the beauty of his
[1:25:08] Holiness and take a flight into the
[1:25:10] skies the Dynamics is the holy spirit
[1:25:13] again he would say I don't know the
[1:25:15] mechanics just the Dynamics is all that
[1:25:18] I'm interested in
[1:25:20] I don't know how he does it but he does
[1:25:22] it because he promised it again he would
[1:25:25] say there's been churches churches
[1:25:26] Brides brides but there's got to come on
[1:25:28] Hallelujah there's got to come a real
[1:25:30] bride there must come one one that's not
[1:25:33] only one that's not only got the
[1:25:35] mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes
[1:25:37] that church live and move in the power
[1:25:38] of those Resurrection until we come to
[1:25:40] that place until we find the place what
[1:25:43] good does it do to polish the hubs what
[1:25:46] good does it do to give her a facelift
[1:25:47] or a simonized job when there's no
[1:25:49] Dynamics in him no matter how much the
[1:25:51] mechanics prove to be Rock there's got
[1:25:53] to be a Dynamics to make it work he said
[1:25:57] that's what he proved Hallelujah that's
[1:25:59] what Easter proved he wasn't only the
[1:26:01] word but he was God himself the Dynamics
[1:26:05] in the word well explain it all brother
[1:26:07] Andrew let me say it like this Balaam
[1:26:10] made a prophecy that there was going to
[1:26:12] be a star that would rise out of Jacob
[1:26:14] and there would be a scepter that would
[1:26:16] ride out rise out of Israel it was 1500
[1:26:19] years before the them wise men ever seen
[1:26:21] that star but they was expecting it they
[1:26:25] was looking for it and you may not know
[1:26:27] how the Holy Ghost is going to come by
[1:26:28] your way but just be looking for it
[1:26:32] [Applause]
[1:26:33] don't you give up on it
[1:26:36] well I've been sitting here 50 years and
[1:26:38] I never got anything shame on you
[1:26:42] shame on you I don't know what the
[1:26:43] message is shame on you when you've been
[1:26:46] given every Power every gift every
[1:26:49] access to what the message is I'll tell
[1:26:52] you what it is it's Satan that's trying
[1:26:53] to keep you away from the Dynamics you
[1:26:56] watch right now other over every single
[1:26:58] thing Satan is trying to keep the Church
[1:27:01] of the Living God away from the power
[1:27:03] why it's because Satan knows assuredly
[1:27:06] that the original Church of Pentecost
[1:27:08] with the power of God Mark 16 in action
[1:27:11] is the church that Jesus claims as his
[1:27:13] own he knows that if the people get the
[1:27:16] true revelation of the true church what
[1:27:19] she is what she stands for that she can
[1:27:22] do the Greater Works that she will be an
[1:27:24] invincible Army if they ever get a true
[1:27:27] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[1:27:29] framework of the Christian church and by
[1:27:31] God's spirit discern and withstand the
[1:27:34] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[1:27:37] powerless before her
[1:27:39] Satan knows this so Satan's trying to
[1:27:42] keep the revelation of Christ away from
[1:27:44] you Satan knows is it all right if I do
[1:27:47] this for a minute Satan knows you'll be
[1:27:49] an invincible Army
[1:27:51] Satan knows that you are certainly the
[1:27:53] Mark 16 Church in action Satan knows
[1:27:56] then the bottomless pit is ready for him
[1:27:58] Satan knows he's lost the battle Satan
[1:28:01] knows that his time has come Satan knows
[1:28:04] he's defeated tonight through the cross
[1:28:05] of Jesus Christ Satan knows
[1:28:08] that if you ever get into a spot where
[1:28:11] you recognize who you are that he has
[1:28:13] lost the battle I'd say take a look
[1:28:15] around Satan We Know Who We Are
[1:28:19] we know whom we have believed and I am
[1:28:21] persuaded that he's able to keep that
[1:28:23] which he's promised unto me and if he
[1:28:26] promised to me he's going to keep his
[1:28:28] word
[1:28:29] [Applause]
[1:28:33] what am I saying to you you got to know
[1:28:35] in whom he has to believe
[1:28:37] you know because God is calling not God
[1:28:40] is calling for separators and God is
[1:28:43] calling for believers in this hour
[1:28:45] because the Bible will tell us that
[1:28:47] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:28:49] for the evidence of Things Not Seen for
[1:28:53] by the elders obtained a good report so
[1:28:55] through faith we understand that the
[1:28:58] worlds were framed by the very word of
[1:28:59] God so that the things which were seen
[1:29:01] were not made of things which do appear
[1:29:05] so we realize that without faith in God
[1:29:09] nothing is possible
[1:29:11] but we know this that with faith all
[1:29:15] things are possible because he that
[1:29:17] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:29:20] you've got to believe that he's able you
[1:29:22] got to believe that he's a Healer you
[1:29:24] got to believe that he's a promise
[1:29:25] keeper and if you do believe he is a
[1:29:28] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:29:30] him
[1:29:31] you see what that faith is brother
[1:29:33] random will tell us that faith is the
[1:29:35] master of all circumstances the faith is
[1:29:38] the Revelation it's the master of all
[1:29:41] circumstances notice
[1:29:45] Lord help me
[1:29:47] and y'all forgive me but notice he said
[1:29:50] what that all symbolizes is a Holy
[1:29:53] Spirit
[1:29:56] then we find out that oil and wine is
[1:29:59] always connected in worship
[1:30:02] you can't go throughout the Bible
[1:30:04] without finding the oil and the wine
[1:30:06] connected together he said it's always
[1:30:08] connected in worship and the wine he
[1:30:11] said which come to me he said that wine
[1:30:13] symbolizes that it was the power it was
[1:30:16] the power of the stimulation by
[1:30:18] Revelation and he said that's when a
[1:30:20] something has been revealed it gives
[1:30:22] stimulation to the believer it's like
[1:30:25] you grabbing a hold of Isaiah chapter
[1:30:27] 53. you see if you ever grab a hold of
[1:30:30] that Revelation and it becomes a
[1:30:32] stimulation to your heart there's not
[1:30:34] one devil in hell that can keep you away
[1:30:37] from your healing if it's been
[1:30:39] personally revealed to you because it
[1:30:41] gives you a stimulation because it's
[1:30:44] been presented by Revelation it's
[1:30:46] something that God has said it's a
[1:30:49] mystery
[1:30:50] it's a mystery but they can't understand
[1:30:52] it but after a while God becomes back
[1:30:55] and reveals it and then he vindicates it
[1:30:59] well I'm going to need some examples
[1:31:01] here brother Andrew how did you get in
[1:31:03] the building brother Timmy Batten it was
[1:31:05] because God dropped her faith in your
[1:31:07] heart that this is where you needed to
[1:31:09] be at and because a man followed his
[1:31:12] heart and followed the leadering of the
[1:31:13] Lord look at his children now
[1:31:17] well I could call any of your names here
[1:31:19] tonight how'd you get in the building
[1:31:21] how'd you get where you are as a
[1:31:23] Believer it's because something was
[1:31:25] revealed to you that you can believe
[1:31:28] I'll tell you that I'll tell you like
[1:31:30] this brother Brandon was dealing with a
[1:31:32] patient one time and he's dealing with
[1:31:33] her and he's dealing with him and he
[1:31:36] says he said that shocked you didn't it
[1:31:38] it shocked you how much Faith you had if
[1:31:40] brother Branham closed this individual
[1:31:42] out that's sitting out there calls him
[1:31:44] out tells him everything about he said
[1:31:46] it shocked you how much Faith you got it
[1:31:48] might shock you how much you actually
[1:31:50] believe tonight if you'd have enough
[1:31:52] Faith to say Lord here I am I'm reaching
[1:31:56] out my hands Jarius one of these days
[1:31:58] you got to take a walk you got to leave
[1:32:00] your old traditions you got to leave
[1:32:02] your uncle you got to leave all your
[1:32:03] Sadducees behind
[1:32:05] and start taking a walk
[1:32:09] what happened with John Ryan out there
[1:32:11] what happened with him he comes through
[1:32:13] the prayer line brother Brandon prayed
[1:32:15] for him and said you're healed
[1:32:17] it wasn't he wasn't he wasn't seeing
[1:32:19] anything he was still blind he was still
[1:32:22] blind and he made his way back in the
[1:32:24] prayer line so brother Adam you told me
[1:32:26] I was healed he said you told me you
[1:32:28] believed
[1:32:30] well brother Andrew I ain't seen what I
[1:32:32] asked for coming to fruition yet you
[1:32:34] told me you believed it
[1:32:38] and when it stopped down to his heart
[1:32:40] that when he was already healed before
[1:32:42] he ever seen the miracle
[1:32:44] before he ever seen the miracle he
[1:32:47] recognized that he was healed how'd he
[1:32:49] recognize it he was blind he couldn't
[1:32:51] see it but he understood it by
[1:32:53] revelation
[1:32:54] well I don't know how my loved one's
[1:32:57] going to get in here but I understand it
[1:32:58] by Revelation that God is the god of
[1:33:01] impossibilities

[1:33:15] the Lord I'm Healed I'd say it sometime
[1:33:17] in your life you're going to have to
[1:33:18] interrupt Satan's plans and start
[1:33:20] praising God for the Revelation whether

[1:34:36] believe me he didn't question his faith
[1:34:39] he kept acting on it he kept believing

[1:35:05] before you see it
[1:35:06] some of these days you want to shout
[1:35:08] before you know it
[1:35:10] [Applause]
[1:35:18] well you better be careful brother
[1:35:19] Andrew you're going to cause a reproach
[1:35:22] on Jesus Christ thanking him for
[1:35:24] something that you ain't seen done yet
[1:35:27] how can I ever reproach the name of
[1:35:30] Jesus Christ when he died for every
[1:35:32] right of calvary
[1:35:34] he is not ashamed of my testimony he's
[1:35:36] not ashamed of me witnessing when I
[1:35:38] don't see it coming
[1:35:41] how about that woman with that issue of
[1:35:43] her stomach at times when the angel
[1:35:45] passed through her neighborhood her
[1:35:46] daughter said Mama you're bringing a
[1:35:48] reproach on the neighborhood but she
[1:35:49] kept on testifying

[1:35:53] well what happened her faith stimulated
[1:35:56] a revelation that the angel passed by
[1:35:58] her neighborhood
[1:36:01] what is it God knows where to deliver
[1:36:04] the package at
[1:36:09] he knows who's going to thank him for it
[1:36:11] he knows who's going to praise him for
[1:36:13] it
[1:36:15] foreign
[1:36:19] when ten lepers were healed only one of
[1:36:23] them turned back well brother Andrew you
[1:36:25] too loud of a Preacher but that Bible
[1:36:27] says in Luke it tells us that one turn
[1:36:30] back and with a loud voice rejoiced
[1:36:33] about it
[1:36:34] [Applause]
[1:36:44] that's what God's coming back for
[1:36:47] God coming back for some Believers God's
[1:36:50] coming back that's what he said when the
[1:36:51] son of man comes again when we find
[1:36:53] Faith he'll look for some church he
[1:36:55] ain't looking for he ain't looking for
[1:36:56] some righteousness he's looking for
[1:36:58] faith
[1:36:58] he's looking for somebody that's willing
[1:37:00] to take him at his word somebody that's
[1:37:02] willing to confess somebody that's
[1:37:03] willing to believe somebody that's
[1:37:05] willing to act we say brother answer I
[1:37:08] prayed after prayer after prayer after
[1:37:10] prayer don't stop praying
[1:37:13] brother Andrew I don't know everything
[1:37:14] I've done and my daughters too ain't
[1:37:16] living right and my son ain't came back
[1:37:18] to the Lord I'm saying to you keep on
[1:37:20] praying
[1:37:21] keep on asking because one of these
[1:37:23] times you're gonna break into around
[1:37:30] come on now why don't you break into
[1:37:32] that world real quick
[1:37:33] [Applause]
[1:37:36] if Moses could call for flies
[1:37:39] if Moses could call for frogs and fleas
[1:37:41] and all of the all of the plagues under
[1:37:43] the Covenant of bulls and goats how much
[1:37:47] more as the people that are under the
[1:37:49] token
[1:37:51] I don't know if you hear what I'm saying
[1:37:53] tonight but the lamb is announcing Satan
[1:37:56] don't you touch that token don't you
[1:37:58] touch my heart
[1:38:00] oh glory be to God if Satan grabs a hold
[1:38:03] of you it's like him grabbing hold of
[1:38:05] Jesus Christ at the cross he lost his
[1:38:08] finger two thousand years ago and he
[1:38:10] recognizes
[1:38:11] that's the same power
[1:38:17] what happened what happened when Ron
[1:38:19] Spencer was laying in a coma for 17 days
[1:38:21] when the fire had burned him up but all
[1:38:24] of a sudden somebody under the faith of
[1:38:27] a Son of God walked in there and said
[1:38:29] today I'm going to talk to my friend
[1:38:32] 17 days 17 days laying there three days
[1:38:36] 36 hours brain dead
[1:38:39] who are you talking about I'm talking
[1:38:41] about a pastor that still preached
[1:38:43] behind this Pulpit every single Sunday
[1:38:47] but somebody had enough Faith to walk
[1:38:50] into a hospital room
[1:38:52] what did you what did Satan recognize in
[1:38:55] Tim Pruitt that day he recognized that
[1:38:57] was her same power that whipped him 2
[1:39:00] 000 years ago and I'll say this to the
[1:39:02] Church of the Living God Satan knows
[1:39:04] that's the same power that's the same
[1:39:06] anointing that's the same influence
[1:39:09] what are you saying brother answer all
[1:39:12] of Heaven is behind this Dynamics
[1:39:14] [Applause]
[1:39:20] well glory be to God what do you know
[1:39:23] what are you talking about brother I'm
[1:39:25] talking about a lamb that is speaking
[1:39:27] against Satan don't you touch it don't
[1:39:29] you touch it and Satan knows that before
[1:39:32] the foundation of the world Jesus Christ
[1:39:34] died for your sins before the foundation
[1:39:37] of the world
[1:39:39] they said oh boy if there is a Believer
[1:39:42] I hope you got your joy shoes on
[1:39:45] he said because when he saw the lamb
[1:39:47] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:39:49] he said God had put your name on the
[1:39:52] Lamb's Book of Life at the same time do
[1:39:54] you got your joy shoes on
[1:39:58] I saw my name
[1:40:04] that's all my name
[1:40:06] y'all don't even flying in your life
[1:40:09] it'll make you a miserable wretch if you
[1:40:12] if everything's good it's the greatest
[1:40:13] thing that there ever can be
[1:40:15] who wants to drive all the way across
[1:40:17] the United States
[1:40:18] but if you can ever fly and everything's
[1:40:20] perfect man it's great
[1:40:24] but if it ain't

[1:47:46] foreign
[1:47:48] if you knew like I know if you grab the
[1:47:51] hold of the Holy Ghost like I got a hold
[1:47:53] of it you'd never let the bottle go but
[1:47:56] the bride has got both oil and wine she
[1:48:00] stimulated by the revelation of Malachi
[1:48:02] 4 that has taken her into a rapturing
[1:48:05] state

[1:48:10] what does it do what does that natural
[1:48:12] stimulant do
[1:48:14] it takes a person
[1:48:17] that's all slumped down

[1:48:25] it's time that some people get a
[1:48:26] refreshing
[1:48:31] and all they can think about their job
[1:48:32] and all they can think about is their
[1:48:34] bills and all they can think about is
[1:48:35] her diagnosis

[1:48:50] there and get drunk
[1:48:53] don't worry I'll get the email with it
[1:48:55] in there but oh but all I'm talking
[1:48:58] about is getting so drunk
[1:49:01] that we have to carry you out like we

[1:49:05] sister Katie out Carrie sister Whitney

[1:49:48] Holy Ghost the devil can't get in them
[1:49:51] the powers of hell can't get them
[1:49:52] depression can't get them anxiety can't

[1:50:20] filled them and took gussers and made
[1:50:22] them tongue talkers
[1:50:24] took men that couldn't live right and

[1:51:22] time come and see
[1:51:24] [Applause]
[1:51:26] these people ain't worked up they
[1:51:29] believe the message
[1:51:30] this is William branham's message and I
[1:51:33] say William Branham if you ever did come
[1:51:35] back you're welcome here to preach
[1:51:44] where are you going to throw yourself
[1:51:46] liable for criticism that's what Mary
[1:51:48] did before she ever felt Jesus start
[1:51:50] kicking she started praising God
[1:51:53] [Applause]
[1:51:55] I ain't seen my loved one I ain't seen
[1:51:57] my son I ain't seen my daughter I ain't
[1:51:59] felt the Holy Ghost why don't you thank
[1:52:01] him for it
[1:52:03] said she threw herself liable for
[1:52:05] criticism Mary didn't stop to think
[1:52:07] about criticism she didn't care about
[1:52:09] criticism and when a man comes to get
[1:52:12] the Holy Ghost
[1:52:13] you don't care what the neighbor's gonna
[1:52:15] say you don't care if you shout you
[1:52:17] don't care if you speak with tongues why
[1:52:20] what's past that you took God at his
[1:52:22] word you don't care for criticism you've
[1:52:25] lost all your devil made homemade
[1:52:27] intellectual society called Prestige the
[1:52:29] thing you want is favored with God
[1:52:32] you don't care what the Holy Spirit
[1:52:34] causes you to do Shout Scream crowd ball
[1:52:37] or anything you want to do anything the
[1:52:39] Holy Spirit puts on you
[1:52:43] you want to make clips about me
[1:52:48] let's make this clip
[1:52:50] you've lost all that man-made stuff and
[1:52:52] you're free in Jesus
[1:52:59] what makes me so dangerous is I don't
[1:53:02] care what they say I don't care what the
[1:53:05] devil does I believe if we can get the
[1:53:08] atmosphere right and the Holy Ghost
[1:53:10] comes these people can leave here healed
[1:53:13] can leave here delivered that's why I
[1:53:16] say oh House of Hell give way in the
[1:53:19] name of Jesus get out of our way we've
[1:53:22] come to thank the Lord
[1:53:23] [Applause]
[1:53:28] where you want to know where I stand at
[1:53:30] I stand with William praying them
[1:53:40] when's the last time you prayed through
[1:53:43] when's the last time you broke into
[1:53:45] prayer and when you got out everybody
[1:53:46] looked clean
[1:53:49] you need a refreshing of the Dynamics
[1:53:51] [Applause]
[1:53:52] [Music]
[1:53:53] [Applause]
[1:53:57] brother Brandon said I've seen them
[1:53:59] people come all the way back here from
[1:54:00] Kentucky
[1:54:02] said they'd stay out there on Saturday
[1:54:03] night
[1:54:04] and he said they have themself one of
[1:54:06] them House to House Parties he said they
[1:54:08] would dance from one house to the next
[1:54:11] he said they do it all night long
[1:54:14] they'd be dancing out there and he said
[1:54:15] when you see him the next day he said
[1:54:17] they was packing back her shoes because
[1:54:19] her feet was so sore I say when's the
[1:54:22] last time you danced so hard that you
[1:54:25] dance yourself out of your shoes
[1:54:27] I'd say when's the last time you beat
[1:54:29] the devil down so hard that it didn't
[1:54:31] know what to do until Monday morning I
[1:54:33] say when's the last time you prayed so
[1:54:35] much that you got drunk on the Holy
[1:54:37] Ghost
[1:54:38] how did I get the Holy Ghost by one
[1:54:40] Spirit we are all baptized into one body
[1:54:42] Jesus Christ he said repent be baptized
[1:54:46] every one of you in the name of the Lord
[1:54:47] Jesus Christ for the remissions of your
[1:54:49] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:54:52] the Holy Ghost
[1:54:53] [Applause]
[1:54:58] uh
[1:54:59] I need this
[1:55:02] I need this
[1:55:05] I'm ashamed I'm ashamed to dance I'm
[1:55:08] ashamed to shout I'm ashamed to thank
[1:55:10] God for the Holy Ghost
[1:55:14] I'm ashamed
[1:55:16] my brother Brandon said that when they
[1:55:17] were up there
[1:55:18] in the upper room he said they lost all
[1:55:21] their dignity when the power fell
[1:55:28] forgive me
[1:55:30] I know what it's like to be that natural
[1:55:32] way
[1:55:34] and he really don't care do you you know
[1:55:37] what I'm talking about you really don't
[1:55:38] care
[1:55:39] you could be so soft that you laid up on
[1:55:41] a gutter and you just don't know where
[1:55:42] you are
[1:55:44] you forgive me
[1:55:46] but I believe that you can have this
[1:55:49] in the spiritual Realm
[1:55:55] I believe that if the angel of the Lord
[1:55:57] gets moving just right you'll do
[1:55:58] anything
[1:56:01] you wouldn't typically do
[1:56:05] when Angela Lord gets to move and
[1:56:06] brother Vijay he will do things that are
[1:56:08] so unseenable
[1:56:11] I was riding in a van
[1:56:14] I was riding in a van and there was a
[1:56:15] little girl
[1:56:17] sister Julia three or four years ago
[1:56:20] an angel Lord got in there my little
[1:56:22] girl Ali got to recognize him that there
[1:56:25] was an angel in the car and she started
[1:56:27] praising God before anybody else in the
[1:56:29] car knew what was going on ain't that
[1:56:30] right brother out
[1:56:32] and all of a sudden the angel said ask
[1:56:34] what you will
[1:56:35] sister Julia started speaking in tongues
[1:56:37] and she can't hardly praise she can't
[1:56:39] hardly pray or praise without God coming
[1:56:41] down and touching her life
[1:56:44] I watched this little girl
[1:56:49] when God was talking about a wave sheath
[1:56:51] being waved over just like it did on the
[1:56:53] day of Pentecost
[1:56:55] I watched you receive a touch of heaven
[1:56:57] and you've been changed ever since
[1:57:05] I watched a little girl in the same
[1:57:07] corner
[1:57:09] I watched the same girl
[1:57:11] in that corner get the Holy Ghost
[1:57:19] you forgive me I'm calling out people
[1:57:22] that ain't ashamed to be called out
[1:57:25] my sister had to drive me home one night
[1:57:27] because I got so drunk on the Holy Ghost
[1:57:30] that the angel Lord started talking to
[1:57:32] her about a well that they had problems
[1:57:33] with
[1:57:36] it was so muddy
[1:57:37] there was no way you could drink out of
[1:57:39] it messed her clothes up when they
[1:57:40] washed her car but the angel of the Lord
[1:57:42] said he's come what the enemy's trying
[1:57:44] to do is block your anointing he's
[1:57:46] trying to block your anointing and steal
[1:57:48] your joy out of your very home by
[1:57:50] trashing up your water
[1:57:52] that night
[1:57:53] that night the age of the Lord give give
[1:57:55] a word to them that their well was going
[1:57:57] to be fixed
[1:58:02] and a year to the date later when I
[1:58:04] spoke to Sister Whitney and said you've
[1:58:07] never been drunk you've never been drunk
[1:58:08] on the Holy Ghost but there's a prophecy
[1:58:10] that's coming by your way and a year to
[1:58:12] the day later she was so drunk on the
[1:58:15] Holy Ghost
[1:58:18] what am I saying to you this is the
[1:58:21] refreshing of the Holy Ghost
[1:58:25] what happened at camp meeting just a few
[1:58:27] weeks ago when sister Tracy when sister
[1:58:30] Tracy was so drunk on the Holy Ghost
[1:58:32] they had to carry her through the hotel
[1:58:34] room
[1:58:36] if you know anything about them like I
[1:58:38] know about them
[1:58:39] they care about germs a little bit but
[1:58:42] she didn't care one lick about germs at
[1:58:45] night when you get so drunk you don't
[1:58:48] care about natural things you don't care
[1:58:50] what people say
[1:58:53] what happened that night brother Jim
[1:58:55] when God told you to stop on that sugar
[1:58:57] diabetes you didn't care about it
[1:59:04] what happened brother Jeffrey that same
[1:59:06] night you was having problem with your
[1:59:08] ankles
