[17:45] this time this evening.
[17:48] We know that God can just move all these
[17:50] mountains out of each and every one of
[17:52] these individuals lives. No matter what
[17:55] is standing in their way this evening,
[17:57] our God can move on these requests. Want
[18:00] to continue to lift up our elderly, each
[18:02] and every one of them. Want to pray for
[18:04] our pastor, brother Ron Spencer. He's
[18:06] speaking to Brother Wayne Lawson's this
[18:08] weekend. Probably taking the pullpit at
[18:11] this moment. So I want to pray for him
[18:13] like I would strengthen him and body and
[18:15] let him step out of the way and just use
[18:17] him in a supernatural way this evening.
[18:20] I want to continue to remember sister
[18:22] Teresa Delaney. She is scheduled for
[18:24] surgery June the 9th at UVA. So I want
[18:28] to pray for her. Also want to be
[18:30] remembering Brother Marcus Turner's
[18:32] 2-year-old grandson that has that
[18:34] enlarged lymph node in the stomach and
[18:37] possibly a second one. They believe it
[18:40] is benign. He is scheduled June the 18th
[18:44] for a consult with a pediatric surgeon.
[18:47] Also want to be remembering our brother
[18:49] Marcus as he has injured that foot and
[18:52] wearing that brace for several weeks. I
[18:54] want to pray for him. I want to remember
[18:57] our sister Wanda Hinkle and family. Glad
[18:59] to have her in the house, Lord, with us
[19:01] this evening. God richly bless you. Dear
[19:05] church family, please continue to pray
[19:07] for Scotty Arnold, Elena Kesler,
[19:10] Samantha Nichols. Thank you, Sister
[19:13] Deborah Watson. Please pray for my niece
[19:16] Haley. She has scarlet fever. Please
[19:19] pray for a full recovery. Thank you,
[19:22] brother Randall Griff. Amen. How many
[19:24] would have an unspoken request and say,
[19:27] "Lord, just come pass my way this
[19:29] evening." Amen. I want to pray for
[19:31] brother Aaron Oglesby. Glad to have him
[19:34] here with us this weekend. Want to just
[19:36] pray that God would just use him here in
[19:38] a supernatural way. Amen. I'm going to
[19:41] ask brother Matt McCclard just come pray
[19:43] over these
[19:48] needs. Amen. Let's bow our
[19:51] heads.
[19:53] Father, what an
[19:55] honor to be in your presence, Father. We
[19:57] feel you in the building, Lord. And
[20:00] Lord, we don't take it for granted,
[20:01] Father. We love
[20:04] you. You're welcome, Lord. God, may you
[20:07] have your own way tonight, Father. Lord,
[20:10] I pray for Brother Aaron right now,
[20:11] Lord. Move all the nerves, Father, and
[20:14] this way, that way. But God, may there
[20:16] be just an uncction of the Holy Ghost,
[20:17] Father, that you would just lead him and
[20:20] guide him, Lord. May you move him
[20:21] completely out of the way and speak
[20:23] through him, Lord. We're thankful, Lord,
[20:25] for the traveling mercies. You brought
[20:26] him this way. But God, we're expecting
[20:28] great things today, Lord. God, we're
[20:30] expecting just an awesome service
[20:31] tonight, God, and even better tomorrow,
[20:33] Father. Cuz we know you're a good God,
[20:36] Lord. And you take good, good care of
[20:37] us, Father. God, you see these needs
[20:40] that we've asked for, Lord. And Lord,
[20:41] we're not just asking in hope. We're
[20:43] asking in doubt, Father. We're asking,
[20:45] we're believing, Father, that there's
[20:47] going to be testimonies, Lord, of how
[20:49] you moved and what you've done, Lord.
[20:51] And how you've not only done that, but
[20:52] you blessed every situation, God. We
[20:55] love you, Lord. Lord, we ask you, Lord,
[20:57] just to take this service into thy
[20:58] hands, Lord. May you move in a mighty
[21:01] way, Lord, in each one of our lives,
[21:03] God. And we'll know we've been touched,
[21:05] Father. We know we've heard from the
[21:07] master, Father. Lord, we just ask for a
[21:10] special blessing. Come on, brother right
[21:14] now. Lord, may you just move in a mighty
[21:16] way in that presence,
[21:18] Father. May you help him just now, God.
[21:21] May the wind of the Holy Ghost just
[21:23] sweep down in the depths of his soul,
[21:24] God, and use him like you've never used
[21:27] him before. Lord, we love you tonight,
[21:29] God. May you get praise and worship,
[21:31] God. May you hear our hearts tonight,
[21:33] God, when our words aren't enough,
[21:35] Father. May the depths of our hearts
[21:37] speak glory, glory, glory.
[21:40] Hallelujah. Thank you, Father. Take this
[21:43] service. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[21:44] Christ, we pray.

[42:00] soul. My
[42:04] soul is
[42:08] [Music]
[42:14] well my soul.
[42:20] Do you realize how blessed you are to be
[42:23] able to say it is well in a world that
[42:26] has fallen apart? In a world that's
[42:28] completely lost all morality and is
[42:31] crumbling all around us, there's a
[42:33] people on the face of the earth that can
[42:34] say it is well with my soul. It don't
[42:38] matter what's going out there. It don't
[42:39] matter who's falling away, who's
[42:41] struggling, who I got I got a goal. I
[42:44] got a goal and it ain't the grave, but
[42:46] I'm waiting for his coming. And I'm
[42:47] going to stand till I see it. And I can
[42:50] stand here tonight and say, "Church, it
[42:52] is well with our soul." Hallelujah. What
[42:56] a wonderful savior we serve. Brother
[42:59] Andrew just don't even know what it
[43:00] means to me that he sung that song just
[43:03] with where we're going tonight. I'm just
[43:05] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[43:08] Amen. Can we pray together? Father, in
[43:10] the name of Jesus, Lord, we thank you
[43:12] for your presence that's already here.
[43:14] Lord, we thank you that once again, you
[43:16] have kept your word and where we've
[43:18] gathered together, you have come to be
[43:19] in the midst, Father. Now, I just pray,
[43:21] Lord Jesus, that as we approach this
[43:23] word that you'll move me out of the way,
[43:25] Lord. Lord, Lord, I've got notes here in
[43:28] front of you of me, Lord, but may not
[43:30] hinder me. May I just be led by you and
[43:32] pulled, Lord, where you'd have me to go.
[43:34] And, Lord, give me the direction and the
[43:36] words to speak that would bless your
[43:38] people, Lord. I'm I'm very aware, Lord
[43:40] Jesus, that I'm speaking to a portion,
[43:43] Lord, of that that that you purchased
[43:44] with your blood. And Lord, I want your
[43:46] word spoke tonight. I want your people
[43:48] encouraged, Lord, exactly how you would
[43:50] have it. I ask you to move me aside now
[43:53] and just speak, Lord. And may you not
[43:54] just anoint my lips, but anoint the
[43:56] listener as well, Lord, so so that the
[43:58] word can have its full effect in this
[44:00] place tonight. Lord, I pray you'll come
[44:02] break every chain, Lord. Every lie of
[44:03] the enemy, may it be broken tonight in
[44:05] the house of God. We commit this time to
[44:08] you. We pray that you'll bless the word
[44:09] that we're about to read. Father, in
[44:11] Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. If if
[44:15] you have your Bibles with with you and
[44:16] you'd like to turn with me to Ephesians
[44:19] 6, verse 13. And I don't want to take
[44:22] too long, but I I tell you what, I I
[44:25] can't express to you uh in the short
[44:28] amount of time that I have right here
[44:29] before we start how how happy I am to be
[44:31] back with you here at Full Gospel
[44:33] Lighthouse Tabernacle. you uh you truly
[44:36] are family to me and I have so many
[44:38] friends here. I count you all as
[44:39] friends. You've you've been there with
[44:41] me from the very very very beginning of
[44:43] my ministry as the very first place I
[44:45] ever preached outside of home and you've
[44:47] always been so loving and so supportive
[44:49] and I I so appreciate you and I love you
[44:52] very much and I me and my family are
[44:55] just so grateful to have the opportunity
[44:56] to be back with you. So God bless you
[44:58] and I just pray that we'll just enjoy a
[45:01] wonderful time in his presence together
[45:02] this weekend. Amen. Amen. And we're
[45:04] going to read here in Ephesians 6. We'll
[45:06] read 13 and 14. Then we're going to look
[45:08] to 1 Thessalonians 4. Ephesians 6 and13
[45:13] says, "Wherefore take unto you the whole
[45:15] armor of God that you may be able to
[45:17] withstand in the evil day." We're there.
[45:21] Amen. We're there. And having done all
[45:25] to
[45:26] stand, stand therefore, having your
[45:30] loins gird about with truth, and having
[45:32] on the breastplate of righteousness.
[45:35] Amen. If you'll look also with me to 1
[45:37] Thessalonians
[45:39] 4, verse 14. 1 Thessalonians 4:14. We'll
[45:43] read down through verse 17. says,"For if
[45:46] we believe that Jesus died and rose
[45:48] again, even so them also which sleep in
[45:51] Jesus will God bring with him. For this
[45:55] we say unto you by the word of the Lord,
[45:58] that we which are alive and remain until
[46:00] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[46:02] them which are asleep. For the Lord
[46:05] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[46:07] shout, with the voice of the archangel,
[46:10] and with the trump of God, and the dead
[46:12] in Christ shall rise first. Then we
[46:16] which are alive and remain shall be
[46:18] caught up together with them in the
[46:20] clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And
[46:24] so shall we ever be with the Lord. Amen.
[46:27] I pray that the Lord will add his
[46:28] blessing. Now as you take your seats.
[46:31] Amen. Such a wonderful atmosphere,
[46:32] wonderful presence. I'm just so thankful
[46:35] to be here with you in
[46:37] this. Like to speak to you
[46:39] tonight on a on a little thought. I just
[46:42] pray that the Lord will get in it here
[46:43] and and and speak to you on we shall
[46:46] remain.
[46:48] We shall remain. And as we read here in
[46:51] the scripture, I think it's such a
[46:52] wonderful promise that we're going to be
[46:54] caught up to meet the Lord. Amen. I I I
[46:57] believe that's just as sure today as
[46:59] it's ever been as the day that promise
[47:01] was given. And and I believe that's what
[47:03] we're all living for. And and I don't
[47:05] believe that we're living this life just
[47:07] for for for things here on this earth or
[47:10] for temporal things, but we're living
[47:11] for that promise. We're living for the
[47:13] opportunity to be caught up into the air
[47:16] to to be ever with the Lord. And I don't
[47:18] I I I don't believe that we're going to
[47:19] have to wait too much longer. I I I
[47:22] don't believe we have too much longer to
[47:24] wait for this. Everything is in place.
[47:26] Prophecies being fulfilled around us all
[47:28] the time. You know, it it shocks me the
[47:30] day we live in that you have people that
[47:32] are that that are getting weaker and
[47:34] weaker in the faith. And I look around
[47:36] say every day that we go further, I'm
[47:39] more and more convinced that William
[47:40] Brandon was a prophet to this age. Every
[47:43] day that goes by, I see more fulfilled
[47:45] and more fulfilled and more fulfilled.
[47:47] And people are somehow another they're
[47:49] getting less and less. And I'm going
[47:51] maybe I just got different eyes. Maybe
[47:53] maybe I'm seeing through a different
[47:54] vision than they are because it's
[47:56] getting more and more obvious that we're
[47:58] on the right path. It's getting more and
[48:00] more obvious that that we are following
[48:03] a vindicated and proven messenger. Amen.
[48:05] And prophecies being fulfilled all
[48:07] around us. And it's going to happen. I
[48:11] just want to tell you what we read, what
[48:12] what we're holding out for the the
[48:14] clouds are going to be rolled back and
[48:16] we're going to be caught. It is going to
[48:18] happen. You can book it. I'm telling
[48:21] you. But I just want to make sure
[48:22] tonight that I'm ready when it happens.
[48:25] I don't want to be caught unawares. I
[48:27] don't want to be caught with something
[48:29] in my life. Listen, I'm so thankful that
[48:31] with all that's going on today that God
[48:33] didn't allow us to be caught unawares.
[48:35] He sent us a prophet with perfectly
[48:37] clear vindication and everything that
[48:40] comes to pass, we can say modern events
[48:42] are being made clear once again by
[48:45] prophecy. We knew it was coming. We knew
[48:48] it was coming. If it's caught you
[48:49] unaware, that's not his fault. That's
[48:51] right. It's going to happen. And I just
[48:54] want to be ready for it. Amen. Amen. One
[48:57] one thing I do know is that the devil
[48:59] isn't going to sit down and let us go
[49:02] without a fight. We hadn't got all the
[49:04] way down here and the devil's going to
[49:06] go, "You know what? It it's true. Let me
[49:08] back off. I'm not going to win anyway."
[49:11] He's not going to back off and he's not
[49:12] going to let us go without a fight.
[49:14] Every single day is a constant battle.
[49:17] Can you attest to that? It's a fight.
[49:19] It's a war every single day. We are in
[49:21] an allout war. And it's a war for your
[49:24] soul. It's a war for the souls of men.
[49:27] It's a war for your children. It's a war
[49:29] for your families. It's a war for your
[49:31] joy. It's a war for your peace. It's a
[49:33] war for your health. It is a constant
[49:36] war. But I'd like to say this. It's a
[49:38] war that we are going to win. Amen. I've
[49:41] read the back of the book. I see that we
[49:43] are victorious. Others may have gone
[49:46] down, but there's a bride in this day
[49:48] and she's going up. We are a victorious
[49:50] people. We are an overcoming people. We
[49:53] don't lose this war. We are the winners
[49:56] in this thing. Hallelujah. You might as
[49:59] well get ready for eternity. You might
[50:01] as well get ready for a crown of life.
[50:04] We win. We're going in a rapture.
[50:07] Hallelujah.
[50:09] Hallelujah.
[50:10] Satan's Eden has come to a full
[50:12] maturity. is getting worse day by day.
[50:15] It's getting worse hour by hour. Listen,
[50:18] people today have completely given over
[50:20] to a repbate mind. They've completely
[50:22] given over to insanity and and they've
[50:25] become so anointed with a satanic
[50:27] anointing that they they begin to
[50:29] manifest
[50:30] outwardly the works of the spirit and
[50:33] the influences that have taken over
[50:35] their body. That's right. I mean, you
[50:37] don't not not to judge people, so to
[50:39] speak, but you see people walking
[50:40] around, you can see demonic powers on
[50:43] their life. They're manifesting what's
[50:46] living on the inside. But I want to look
[50:48] away from that for a minute and say, if
[50:50] there's a people manifesting that, there
[50:52] is another people on the face of the
[50:54] earth that has reached maturity in this
[50:56] day and they are manifesting the works
[50:58] of the life that is on the inside of
[51:01] them and is living out of them. And they
[51:03] are they are manifesting holiness. They
[51:05] are manifesting overcoming power. They
[51:08] are manifesting a complete Christian
[51:10] life to a dying world. Amen. There's
[51:13] another people in the land that has
[51:15] reached maturity and they are
[51:17] manifesting the works of Jesus Christ.
[51:20] Another people in the land who under
[51:22] their messenger is the final voice to
[51:24] the final age. That's not just a quote.
[51:28] That's identifying you. That's
[51:30] identifying who you are and what your
[51:32] purpose is to manifest to the world. to
[51:34] let your life speak out about a living
[51:36] God. Amen. That people that that that
[51:39] that are on the earth, and I'm talking
[51:41] about you, they haven't come to this
[51:42] place to fall. We haven't come to this
[51:45] place to fall short. We haven't come to
[51:47] this place to be lukewarm. But we have
[51:50] come out in order to conquer. We didn't
[51:52] leave Egypt behind to stay in the
[51:54] wilderness. We didn't leave Egypt behind
[51:55] to look back and say, "I wish I had
[51:57] leaks and garlics. I don't want none of
[51:59] that. I've come out to conquer the
[52:01] land." and the seals have opened and
[52:04] Jericho has fallen and it's open to us
[52:06] tonight. It's time we go in and conquer
[52:09] the land. It's what you've been called
[52:11] to do. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[52:14] Hallelujah. We haven't been called to
[52:16] stop short. We've been called out to
[52:18] take the land. We've been called out for
[52:21] a body change. We've been called out for
[52:22] a rapture. We've been called out for a
[52:25] marriage supper. But in order to do
[52:27] that, we cannot be a stagnant people.
[52:31] We cannot be a people who who've
[52:33] remained in the same place, in the same
[52:34] condition year after year after year,
[52:36] and yet satisfied that we've been called
[52:38] out.
[52:40] We haven't been called out to die in the
[52:42] wilderness. It's two parts. It calls you
[52:45] out, but it also takes you in.
[52:48] Hallelujah. I I appreciate the victories
[52:50] in your past. I appreciate that you can
[52:52] point back to testimonies, but I've
[52:54] often said it before. If you was still
[52:56] on the banks of the Red Sea dancing a
[52:59] week after that happened, you was left
[53:01] behind.
[53:02] You got to move on to your next victory
[53:04] and your next victory and your next
[53:07] victory. Step after step after step
[53:09] after step until you step into the
[53:11] translation of your body.
[53:14] Hallelujah.
[53:16] a people going forward.
[53:18] A people progressing.
[53:21] Hallelujah. And we we have to get it out
[53:23] of our heads that it's going to be easy.
[53:25] That's right. Many times because we're
[53:26] struggling, we think we're failing.
[53:29] Struggle don't mean fail. Struggle means
[53:31] fight. And it's going to be a fight
[53:34] every single day of your life. I'm
[53:35] struggling. Praise God. That means
[53:38] you're taking another step. I'm
[53:40] struggling. I'm barely moving. Praise
[53:41] God. You're still in the fight tonight.
[53:44] Hallelujah. It's not going to be easy.
[53:46] It's going to be a war. It's never been
[53:48] easy. It's something that you have to be
[53:51] willing to fight for.
[53:54] We are told here in Ephesians to put on
[53:56] the whole armor of God so that we're
[53:58] able to stand against the ws of the
[54:01] devil. The scripture identifies our
[54:03] enemy here as the devil.
[54:06] Not flesh and blood.
[54:09] Let's stop for a minute.
[54:11] No matter what, your enemy is not flesh
[54:15] and blood.
[54:17] I don't care how mad you are at your
[54:21] wife. We can go both ways with that. I
[54:24] don't care how mad you are at your
[54:25] husband. I don't care what the preacher
[54:27] said or how mad the deacon made you.
[54:31] Your enemy is not flesh and blood.
[54:33] That's right. Let's take all the effort
[54:36] and the energy that we take holding
[54:38] grudges against people and throwing
[54:40] darts at people and getting upset about
[54:42] this and upset about that and let's turn
[54:44] that energy back towards the one true
[54:47] enemy, the one that's after your soul,
[54:49] the one that's after your children, the
[54:51] one that's trying to keep you here. And
[54:53] if we can get our arrows aimed back
[54:54] where they're supposed to be, we'll get
[54:56] a lot further down the road. That is
[54:58] your brother. That is your sister. They
[55:01] are not your enemy. ever, ever, ever,
[55:03] ever, ever. They are the ones that we
[55:06] are fighting together with to get to
[55:08] eternity.
[55:11] Hallelujah.
[55:13] Flesh and blood is not your enemy, but
[55:16] principalities and powers and rulers of
[55:19] darkness and spiritual wickedness in
[55:20] high places. And the word tells us,
[55:23] "Having done all, to stand." What's that
[55:26] mean? All is pretty self-explanatory.
[55:31] everything you can sold out every single
[55:36] effort you can give. See, this isn't a
[55:39] halfway battle.
[55:42] If you are halfway in, I'm going to tell
[55:43] you, you're going to eventually be all
[55:45] the way out.
[55:48] You are going nowhere with a halfway
[55:50] effort but to the tribulation.
[55:53] This is an allin battle. It's total war
[55:56] for total victory. The enemy isn't
[55:59] coming at you halfway. When's the last
[56:01] time devil gave you a break?
[56:04] When's the last time devil said you get
[56:05] a day off? I tell you what, I wish we'd
[56:08] get the attitude and go on the offensive
[56:10] a little bit and say, "Devil, I ain't
[56:11] giving you a day off. I ain't taking a
[56:13] day off from my Christian walk. I ain't
[56:15] backing off my promises. I ain't backing
[56:17] off my healing. I'mma sit here and pound
[56:20] and pound and pound and beat and knock
[56:23] and knock and plague him." And he says,
[56:25] "I've had enough. Take your rapture.
[56:28] take your healing and get out of my
[56:30] kingdom. I'm not going to give him a day
[56:33] off. Stay on
[56:35] him. Come after him. Take your victory
[56:39] back. Take your healing. Take your
[56:41] family.
[56:43] Hallelujah. No days off for the enemy.
[56:46] Hallelujah. Quit petting him. I say no
[56:48] quarter. Give him no quarter.
[56:52] Hallelujah.
[56:56] He's sending everything he's got at you.
[56:59] Jesus said the gates of hell will not
[57:01] prevail against his church. Brother
[57:03] Brandham comes in and says that shows
[57:05] that the gates of hell would be against
[57:07] it.
[57:09] What does this mean? The gates of hell.
[57:13] Strong's Greek concordance in the Greek
[57:16] lexicon in the New Testament indicates
[57:18] that gates in
[57:20] antiquity was used to indicate authority
[57:23] and
[57:24] power. The word typically refers to the
[57:27] exit that people go out
[57:29] of. And in this sense, the word focuses
[57:32] on what proceeds out of
[57:35] something. So what he's saying is
[57:38] everything that proceeds out of hell
[57:43] will be against you.
[57:45] All
[57:46] power, all demons,
[57:49] all
[57:50] darkness, everything that can come out
[57:52] of hell will be against you. And you
[57:55] better put on the whole armor of God
[57:57] because you aren't winning this on
[57:58] church attendance.
[58:03] You aren't winning this because you
[58:04] believe God sent a prophet. You aren't
[58:07] winning this with head knowledge. You
[58:10] ain't winning this with just the
[58:11] mechanics. You ain't winning this with
[58:14] just the dynamics. You got to put on the
[58:17] whole armor of God. The parts you like,
[58:20] the parts you don't like, the parts you
[58:22] understand, the parts you don't
[58:23] understand. It don't matter. If you want
[58:26] to win this battle, you got to go all
[58:28] the way. That means through
[58:29] justification, through sanctification,
[58:31] you got to go all the way to the upper
[58:33] room. You got to be filled with the
[58:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And then
[58:36] don't stop there. But say, "Lord, fill
[58:38] me again. Fill me again. Give me more.
[58:41] Wrap me in your love. Wrap me in your
[58:43] safety. And progress daily."
[58:47] Hallelujah. It's the only way to win.
[58:49] Lord, I need a refilling tonight. I need
[58:52] more of your spirit tonight. I need your
[58:54] leadership tonight. I need victory
[58:56] tonight cuz I know in the morning the
[58:59] devil's going to be waiting on me.
[59:03] Hallelujah. We got to take it all.
[59:06] and get it down on the inside of it and
[59:08] allow it to change us. Allow it to
[59:10] fortify us. But once you do that, you
[59:13] can't lose.
[59:15] Amen. The prophet of God says, "And as
[59:18] the battles rage, why, you become a real
[59:20] target." So there's only one thing to
[59:22] do. Put on the whole armor of faith.
[59:24] Stand true to God and march forward.
[59:27] That's all. God's army does not retreat.
[59:30] It goes on. Many of them drop off to the
[59:33] side and start this, that, or the other.
[59:35] But the army of God marches forward.
[59:38] We're going right on and on. He says,
[59:41] "Oh, we have a word for us." And I want
[59:43] us to anchor in on this word tonight. We
[59:47] have a word for us all at this time.
[59:50] It's hold fast, persevere, don't give
[59:54] up, put on the whole armor of God, use
[59:57] every weapon he has given us, use every
[1:00:00] gift at our disposal, and look ahead
[1:00:03] with joy because we are going to be
[1:00:06] crowned by him who is king of kings and
[1:00:09] lord of lords. I say hallelujah. He said
[1:00:13] look ahead with joy. He said because
[1:00:15] you're going to be crowned by him who is
[1:00:17] king of kings and lord of lords. Amen.
[1:00:20] We have a word for us at this time. Hold
[1:00:23] fast and use every gift at our disposal.
[1:00:27] And having done all to stand, stand.
[1:00:32] Having done all to stand. Stand. When
[1:00:36] you feel defeated tonight, stand. When
[1:00:39] you feel you can't go on, stand. When
[1:00:43] you feel like you've given it your all,
[1:00:45] stand when you feel like everybody has
[1:00:47] forsaken you. Stand tonight and look
[1:00:51] forward with joy. Hallelujah. And you
[1:00:54] have this promise. The gates of hell
[1:00:56] will not prevail against you.
[1:01:00] Hallelujah. Glory to God. When you got
[1:01:03] nothing left to give, think about what
[1:01:05] that scripture says there. Having done
[1:01:07] all to stand, that means there's nothing
[1:01:08] left to do. And then it says, stand.
[1:01:13] Well, how are you going to do it if you
[1:01:14] got nothing left to give? He's always
[1:01:16] going to make up for what you lack.
[1:01:19] Listen, he don't ever ask you for
[1:01:21] anything that he don't provide. He says
[1:01:23] there's got to be a lifegiving because
[1:01:25] the law was broken. He says, "But I got
[1:01:27] this." And he gave his life. He says,
[1:01:29] "You got to have the Holy Ghost to
[1:01:31] overcome, but I got this." And he gives
[1:01:33] you the Holy Ghost. He says, "You got to
[1:01:35] stand." And you said, "But I can't." He
[1:01:37] says, "You just give me your all and
[1:01:39] I'll make up the difference when you're
[1:01:41] going to fall. I got you. I'll lead you
[1:01:44] into battle. I'll lift you up. I'll take
[1:01:46] you in my arms. I got this.
[1:01:50] Hallelujah. When you got nothing left to
[1:01:53] give. You have to forgive me when I get
[1:01:55] to some of my history stories cuz I tell
[1:01:57] them so many times. I probably told them
[1:02:00] here. But it makes me think about some
[1:02:03] of my I started to say countrymen. That
[1:02:05] ain't right. Some folks from my state,
[1:02:07] the Louisiana Tigers when they was
[1:02:09] fighting there at the second battle of
[1:02:14] Manasses. They ran out of ammunition.
[1:02:17] And they're groping frantically for
[1:02:18] ammunition among the dead and among the
[1:02:21] wounded and they're barely the Yankees
[1:02:24] kept coming up there. They're they're
[1:02:25] defending this railroad cut unfinished.
[1:02:28] You know, it's built up with rocks and
[1:02:29] boulders and the Yankees coming up and
[1:02:31] they they completely run out of
[1:02:33] ammunition. They they say the the
[1:02:34] Yankees got so close to the top that the
[1:02:37] flags of the two units were touching
[1:02:39] together at the top of the hill. It was
[1:02:42] in dire situation. They had given all
[1:02:44] they had to give.
[1:02:46] They didn't have no more bullets. And
[1:02:48] finally their commander and officer
[1:02:50] looks around and he screams out, "Make
[1:02:53] use of the
[1:02:55] rocks. Make use of the rocks." And they
[1:02:58] said, "Such a flying of rocks was never
[1:03:01] seen before and never seen since." And
[1:03:03] they start picking up rocks. He says,
[1:03:05] "By my stripes, you are healed. By my
[1:03:08] stripes, I am healed. They will be there
[1:03:11] and their offspring with them. I'm the
[1:03:13] Lord God that health thee. I'll never
[1:03:16] leave you. I'll never forsake you. When
[1:03:18] you got nothing left, make use of the
[1:03:20] rocks around you. Pick something up and
[1:03:23] go to throwing at the devil. Stand and
[1:03:26] then stand and then stand some more.
[1:03:30] Make use of the rocks tonight.
[1:03:35] Hallelujah. Oh, glory. He says, "Fear
[1:03:38] not. I'm with thee.
[1:03:41] Be not dismayed. I am thy God. I will
[1:03:45] strengthen thee. I will help thee. I
[1:03:48] will uphold thee with the right hand of
[1:03:51] my righteousness.
[1:04:02] You fight with whatever you can grab a
[1:04:03] hold of. Tonight,
[1:04:06] I promise you, difference between us and
[1:04:08] them boys is we won't never run out of
[1:04:10] ammunition.
[1:04:12] We ain't never running out. It's an
[1:04:14] eternal supply. It was good 2,000 years
[1:04:17] ago, it's good tonight. It was good 50
[1:04:19] years ago, it's good tonight. It's an
[1:04:21] automatic that just keeps firing. Just
[1:04:24] get it trained on your enemy one time.
[1:04:26] Just hold the trigger down one time. You
[1:04:28] just hold it down till there's nothing
[1:04:30] left of that enemy. Don't back off.
[1:04:31] Don't lay your weapon down. Get it
[1:04:33] trained on him tonight. And hold on to
[1:04:35] that
[1:04:36] trigger. Hallelujah.
[1:04:42] [Applause]
[1:04:44] Halfway fighting ain't going to bring a
[1:04:45] victory. You got to be determined. I'm
[1:04:48] not giving up. I'm not backing down. I
[1:04:52] will remain.
[1:04:54] Hallelujah. Goodness. Here we go. I
[1:04:57] can't get out of the old stuff. Back at
[1:05:01] the start of the Texas
[1:05:03] Revolution and them boys done took over
[1:05:05] the
[1:05:09] Alamo, Colonel Travis there realizing
[1:05:12] that defeat was almost certain. Y'all
[1:05:14] know the story. We learned it as kids.
[1:05:17] He took his saber and he drew a line in
[1:05:19] the sand. See, the thing is, he'd
[1:05:21] already made up his mind.
[1:05:23] I don't care if you come over. I don't
[1:05:26] care if you leave. Go ahead. He was
[1:05:28] giving him the opportunity. Go ahead.
[1:05:31] But I'm going to remain. I'm going to
[1:05:34] stand here and fight. I'm going to stand
[1:05:36] here and die like a soldier if I have
[1:05:39] to. It don't matter if daddy leaves. It
[1:05:41] don't matter if mama leaves. It don't
[1:05:43] matter what uncle does. It don't matter
[1:05:45] what that church says or that church
[1:05:46] says. I drawing a line in the sand
[1:05:48] tonight. I say, who's on the Lord's
[1:05:50] side? Who's willing to remain? Who's
[1:05:53] willing to fight? But it's darkness all
[1:05:55] around us. We're surrounded on every
[1:05:57] side. I'm staying right here. I'm not
[1:06:00] backing off. I'm not giving you an itch.
[1:06:03] Come and take it. Come and take it. If
[1:06:06] you think you can, but I'm standing on
[1:06:08] the
[1:06:09] word.
[1:06:12] Hallelujah.
[1:06:14] Glory. I'm not going to back off one
[1:06:17] promise tonight. Hallelujah. I'm not
[1:06:19] giving one inch to the devil.
[1:06:22] Travis would write a letter late
[1:06:24] February
[1:06:25] 1836 just days before the final stand at
[1:06:28] the
[1:06:29] Alamo. I read this letter to help me
[1:06:31] catch my breath.
[1:06:34] I ain't done much cardio since last
[1:06:36] year, so I'm in the same spot I was last
[1:06:39] time.
[1:06:45] He says, "Fellow citizens and
[1:06:48] compatriots," he addressed it to the
[1:06:50] people of Texas and all
[1:06:52] Americans. Fellow citizens and
[1:06:54] compatriots, I am besieged by a thousand
[1:06:57] or more of the Mexicans under Santana. I
[1:07:00] have sustained a continual bombardment
[1:07:02] and canonade for 24 hours and have not
[1:07:05] lost a man. The enemy has demanded a
[1:07:09] surrender at discretion. Otherwise, the
[1:07:12] garrison are to be put to the sword. How
[1:07:14] many of y'all have heard
[1:07:16] it? Just lay down your weapon. Back off
[1:07:20] a little. I'll leave you alone.
[1:07:23] I'll let your family
[1:07:24] live. I I'll let that marriage stay
[1:07:27] together. I'll fix that relationship
[1:07:29] there with your kids. Just back off some
[1:07:32] stuff. Just be willing to back
[1:07:36] off. Otherwise, I'm taking all of you.
[1:07:39] Otherwise, you're all gonna die. I love
[1:07:42] Travis's response. I'm not even a big
[1:07:45] fan of Texas, and I love Travis's
[1:07:49] response. He says, "I have answered the
[1:07:53] demand with a cannon shot." And our flag
[1:07:56] still waves proudly from the walls. I
[1:07:59] shall never surrender or retreat. I like
[1:08:02] to tell the devil tonight, I shall never
[1:08:04] surrender or retreat. I shall never
[1:08:07] surrender or retreat. I shall never
[1:08:09] surrender or retreat. It's time we start
[1:08:12] answering his demands with a cannon
[1:08:14] shot. Boom. I'm not backing off. If you
[1:08:17] want this, you're going to have to come
[1:08:19] and take it. I will not give up. I won't
[1:08:22] back down because I know how it ends. I
[1:08:25] know how it ends. My reinforcements
[1:08:27] ain't coming. My reinforcements are
[1:08:30] here. They're in the building tonight.
[1:08:32] The God of angel armies is here to fight
[1:08:35] your battles.
[1:08:37] Hallelujah.
[1:08:41] He says, "I call on you in the name of
[1:08:42] liberty, of patriotism, and everything
[1:08:45] dear to the American character. Come to
[1:08:47] our aid with all dispatch. The enemy is
[1:08:51] receiving reinforcements daily. Will no
[1:08:54] doubt increase to three or 4 thousand in
[1:08:57] four or five
[1:08:58] days. If this call is neglected, I am
[1:09:01] determined to sustain myself as long as
[1:09:04] possible and die like a soldier who
[1:09:07] never forgets what is due to his own
[1:09:09] honor and that of his country. Victory
[1:09:13] or
[1:09:15] death.
[1:09:16] Victory or death. This my favorite part
[1:09:19] of the whole letter. He signs it William
[1:09:22] Travis and then he says,
[1:09:24] "PS, the Lord is on our side."
[1:09:30] Hallelujah. Oh, it's dark, brother
[1:09:32] Aaron. Leodysia sickness. My family's
[1:09:34] falling apart. I don't know if I can go
[1:09:36] on. PS, the Lord is on your side. Oh,
[1:09:42] glory to God. It's the darkest age.
[1:09:44] Demons everywhere. 200 million demons.
[1:09:47] P.S. The Lord is on your side. Oh,
[1:09:51] there's lies being told. My name's being
[1:09:53] scandalized. PS, the Lord is on your
[1:09:56] side.
[1:09:58] Hallelujah.
[1:10:02] Hallelujah. Travis wrote to all
[1:10:04] Americans in the world and his words
[1:10:06] echoed the feelings of many patriots
[1:10:08] down through the years. I'll never
[1:10:10] retreat. I'll never surrender. And it so
[1:10:13] stirred men till they rallied around a
[1:10:15] cause for victory. Think about it. They
[1:10:18] rallied for land. They rallied for
[1:10:23] Texas. I ain't worried about Texas.
[1:10:27] I'm calling you tonight to rally on this
[1:10:30] message, to stand on this message and
[1:10:33] fight for eternity. We will make our
[1:10:35] stand here or die. We won't back off.
[1:10:37] The word is true. The message is true.
[1:10:40] The prophet is vindicated. I'm called to
[1:10:42] overcome. I'm going in a rapture. And I
[1:10:44] rally the troops on this tonight that we
[1:10:47] aren't going to back off. This is the
[1:10:49] word. This is the truth. And it will
[1:10:51] change your bodies.
[1:10:53] Hallelujah.
[1:10:56] Oh, glory. Take your stand on this
[1:10:58] message. No matter what the
[1:11:01] cost your attitude be tonight, I'll
[1:11:03] fight for my children. I'll fight for my
[1:11:06] family. I'll fight for my marriage.
[1:11:10] Hallelujah. I'll fight for the faith as
[1:11:12] it was once delivered to the saints.
[1:11:15] Hallelujah. I'll have the dynamics to go
[1:11:18] with the mechanics. I won't stop short
[1:11:20] of total victory. I say it's time for a
[1:11:23] line in the sand moment where we make a
[1:11:26] decision. There's no more going back.
[1:11:29] I've made my decision. Hallelujah. You
[1:11:32] can turn people against me. You can
[1:11:34] false accuse me. You can surround me.
[1:11:36] You can attack me. But I won't back off
[1:11:38] one thing this word promises.
[1:11:41] Hallelujah. And when I've done all to
[1:11:43] stand, I'm going to stand. Glory.
[1:11:47] Because there's a promise given. 1
[1:11:49] Thessalonians 4:17. We've already read
[1:11:51] it. Then we which are alive and remain
[1:11:55] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:11:57] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
[1:12:00] Brother Bram says, "You're always
[1:12:01] pointing to how wicked the the world's
[1:12:03] getting, but you fail to see how
[1:12:05] powerful the church is getting at the
[1:12:07] same time. She's rising up, standing on
[1:12:09] her feet. Oh, she's a little flock, but
[1:12:11] brother, God's with her." P.S.
[1:12:14] Lord's on our side. He says that she's
[1:12:17] going to triumph just as certain as
[1:12:19] Christ rose from the dead. Amen. God's
[1:12:21] church shall never fail. The gates of
[1:12:24] hell shall not prevail against it,
[1:12:26] should they be against it, but they
[1:12:28] cannot prevail. The church is going to
[1:12:29] triumph through the blood of Jesus
[1:12:31] Christ to the victory march. I'm
[1:12:33] positive of this one thing that God will
[1:12:36] have a church without spot, wrinkle, or
[1:12:39] blemished.
[1:12:42] But you must be determined that I'm
[1:12:44] going to remain.
[1:12:46] I'm going to be alive and remain.
[1:12:48] Somebody's going to be doing more than
[1:12:49] just breathing. It don't mean
[1:12:52] alive. There's going to be plenty of
[1:12:53] people breathing.
[1:12:56] What's it mean alive? They're going to
[1:12:57] be quickened by the power of the Holy
[1:12:59] Ghost. They're going to be alive under
[1:13:01] the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1:13:03] Hallelujah. They're going to be
[1:13:05] quickened with the power. Somebody's
[1:13:07] going to be remaining true to the word,
[1:13:09] remaining faithful to the promise.
[1:13:13] To remain can mean many things. It can
[1:13:16] be unused. That's not what it means here
[1:13:18] to those that are alive and unused. It's
[1:13:21] not what it's talking about. Left over
[1:13:25] or stay behind. Y'all remain here. Nope,
[1:13:28] that ain't me.
[1:13:31] I I don't want to stay behind. But we're
[1:13:33] looking at remain here in this meaning.
[1:13:36] Those who endure, those who go on, those
[1:13:39] who carry on, those who persist, those
[1:13:41] who stand, those who prevail, we will be
[1:13:45] alive and prevailing. He's not coming to
[1:13:49] rapture us because we're getting
[1:13:50] defeated. He has to come snatch us away.
[1:13:53] He's coming to rapture us because we've
[1:13:55] conquered every single devil underneath
[1:13:59] our feet. And he says, "It's time. I've
[1:14:02] proven my point. My wife has stood in
[1:14:04] Satan's Eden and she's conquered every
[1:14:07] devil and the gates of hell have been
[1:14:09] against her and they did not prevail.
[1:14:11] Now I can take her home." Hallelujah.
[1:14:14] It's not to rescue us. We're winning.
[1:14:18] We're prevailing.
[1:14:21] Hallelujah.
[1:14:24] This battle versus Satan is not a new
[1:14:26] battle. It's not even a battle that
[1:14:28] began on
[1:14:29] earth. It began in heaven. It was a
[1:14:33] battle of wills. God's will and Satan's
[1:14:37] will. Battle of plans, God's plan,
[1:14:41] Satan's plan.
[1:14:43] And the greatest battle ever fought,
[1:14:44] Brother Brown says, "This great first
[1:14:46] battle that was ever fought began in
[1:14:48] heaven when Michael and his angels
[1:14:50] fought against Lucifer and his angels.
[1:14:52] It first started, the first battle was
[1:14:54] in heaven. So sin did not originate on
[1:14:57] earth. It originated in heaven. And then
[1:14:59] it was thrown down from heaven, cast out
[1:15:01] of heaven to the earth, and it fell on
[1:15:03] human
[1:15:04] beings. Then the battle from angels
[1:15:06] become human battles. And Satan come to
[1:15:09] destroy God's creation. what God had
[1:15:12] created to be for himself, Satan come to
[1:15:15] destroy it. That's what his purpose was,
[1:15:19] was to destroy it. Then the battle began
[1:15:22] here on earth and began in us and it's
[1:15:24] been raging ever
[1:15:26] since. So, Satan's thrown down out of
[1:15:29] heaven and immediately he turns his tack
[1:15:32] onto God's
[1:15:33] children and he begins to think, how do
[1:15:36] I stop the plan of God? How do I destroy
[1:15:38] his sons and daughters? and and he goes
[1:15:40] to work in the Garden of Eden. And just
[1:15:42] to sum it up and move quickly, he finds
[1:15:44] a way back in, so to speak. He finds a
[1:15:47] way to get back to a position of
[1:15:49] authority. And it seems as though he's
[1:15:50] been successful because man falls and
[1:15:53] and Satan once again has a place to
[1:15:55] operate from. And he becomes the prince
[1:15:58] of the power of the air. And man
[1:16:00] forfeits his God-given rights. And and
[1:16:02] sickness and death and dying now reigns
[1:16:04] over all the earth. But we learn very on
[1:16:07] in this story that we serve a very
[1:16:10] determined God.
[1:16:13] And he was determined that his plan
[1:16:15] would not fail. He was determined that
[1:16:17] you would not fail. See, we serve a God
[1:16:21] that's not going to give up on you.
[1:16:23] People may give up on you. Preachers may
[1:16:25] give up on you. Family may give up on
[1:16:28] you. God will never give up on you.
[1:16:32] Amen. No matter the stain of sin upon
[1:16:35] your life, no. No matter how far you
[1:16:37] feel like you've gone, no matter what
[1:16:39] the devil is whispering in your ear,
[1:16:41] even tonight, know this. God has not
[1:16:44] given up on you. God has not given up on
[1:16:48] you. There's grace for you here tonight.
[1:16:50] There's mercy for you here tonight.
[1:16:53] There's deliverance for you here
[1:16:54] tonight. Listen, that fear and that
[1:16:57] depression that's been hounding your
[1:16:58] life, that is not forever. That
[1:17:00] besetting sin is not forever. That
[1:17:02] family cycle is not forever. There is a
[1:17:05] power in the building tonight if you
[1:17:07] will allow it to deal with your life.
[1:17:09] That'll break every sin, break every
[1:17:11] family cycle. It'll replace that joy and
[1:17:14] that depression with joy and that
[1:17:16] sadness with gladness. It is here
[1:17:19] tonight and it's for you. No matter what
[1:17:22] condition you're in, because God does
[1:17:24] not give up on his children.
[1:17:28] Hallelujah.
[1:17:31] It's time you begin to turn away from
[1:17:33] the lie of the enemy. That's right. It's
[1:17:35] time you cast down the doubts that he's
[1:17:37] been feeding you and and anchor tonight
[1:17:39] in the work of
[1:17:41] Calvary. The eternal word of God.
[1:17:43] Listen, brother Brown says, "If a man
[1:17:45] once anchors his heart against the heart
[1:17:48] of
[1:17:48] Calvary, all devils in hell will never
[1:17:54] shake him no more. He's there."
[1:17:58] I'd like to say that again. All
[1:18:01] devils. What I'm hearing in that quote,
[1:18:03] brother Andrew, is that he ain't got
[1:18:05] enough. Because if he sent everything
[1:18:08] he's got and he can't shake you. If he
[1:18:11] sent everything he's got and you're
[1:18:13] still standing. If he has unleashed the
[1:18:16] gates of hell and yet on a Saturday
[1:18:18] night here in Elton to Virginia, you're
[1:18:20] standing on your feet praising the King
[1:18:22] of Kings and living a Christian life. He
[1:18:25] don't have enough to stop you. He sent
[1:18:27] everything. There's nobody else to send.
[1:18:31] He don't got enough to stop you tonight.
[1:18:34] All you got to do is keep taking steps
[1:18:36] and don't lay your weapon down. The only
[1:18:39] thing he's got is to talk you into
[1:18:41] quitting because he can't stop you.
[1:18:44] Hallelujah.
[1:18:48] Oh, but brother Heron, you don't
[1:18:50] understand. All these devils coming
[1:18:52] against me and I just got saved.
[1:18:56] I just gave my heart to the I'm new to
[1:18:58] the message. David was in the army five
[1:19:01] minutes and he killed Goliath.
[1:19:05] It don't matter how long, how new, how
[1:19:07] you just came in or what struggle you've
[1:19:09] been having. All you got to know is that
[1:19:11] I got a God that goes before me. He
[1:19:13] said, "I'll never leave you. I'll never
[1:19:15] forsake you. You may come to me in the
[1:19:17] name of these gods of the world. You may
[1:19:19] think you're going to sink me with
[1:19:20] Leodysa, but I'll come and I serve the
[1:19:23] the God. Hallelujah. I serve the God of
[1:19:26] eternity, the God that created the
[1:19:28] universe, the God that blew dust and
[1:19:30] created my bodies. He goes before me to
[1:19:33] fight. Oh, I've only been here a day.
[1:19:35] But there is an eternal quality on the
[1:19:38] inside of you. Hallelujah.
[1:19:41] Oh, you were with him when he won at
[1:19:43] Calvary. You were with him when he went
[1:19:45] to the grave. You were with him when he
[1:19:46] went down to hell. Most importantly, you
[1:19:49] were in him when he resurrected and rose
[1:19:52] back to heaven. Hallelujah. and overcame
[1:19:55] death, hell, and the grave. Leodya
[1:19:58] cannot stop you. You've already won.
[1:20:03] Hallelujah. Woo.
[1:20:12] It doesn't matter if you're a Christian
[1:20:14] that's failed time after time after
[1:20:16] time. That's right. You just describe
[1:20:20] Shamgar and we look at him as a hero.
[1:20:25] Well, I hadn't done right by my family.
[1:20:28] I hadn't led him the way I should have.
[1:20:30] I hadn't done this. I hadn't prayed
[1:20:33] enough. The devil constantly robs me.
[1:20:36] Okay,
[1:20:36] Shamgar. That's him. Year after year
[1:20:40] after year after year after year, he
[1:20:43] came to the meetings. He got a touch. He
[1:20:45] sat there on Sundays and got a touch. He
[1:20:48] got prayed for by the pastor and got a
[1:20:49] touch and got robbed and got robbed and
[1:20:53] got robbed. That's me, brother Aaron. I
[1:20:55] get robbed. I get robbed. I get robbed.
[1:20:58] Well, today is a different day. Today is
[1:21:00] a day of recognition. Today you
[1:21:02] recognize I am a son of the living God.
[1:21:05] Today is the day it stops. Today I draw
[1:21:08] a line in the sand. Today I don't go
[1:21:10] back anymore. Today I meet my enemy face
[1:21:13] to face. Today my besetting sin gets his
[1:21:16] head chopped off. Today is the day I
[1:21:18] stand and fight. I'm not giving in no
[1:21:21] more. I will remain on the promises of
[1:21:24] God.
[1:21:26] Hallelujah. You are not forsaken. You
[1:21:29] will not fall. You got to recognize I am
[1:21:33] a child of God.
[1:21:36] Boy, the devil loves to beat us up over
[1:21:37] our mistakes.
[1:21:40] Listen, Adam and Eve had just sold the
[1:21:42] whole world into sin and death.
[1:21:46] Whatever you've done, you didn't do
[1:21:54] that. You're not
[1:21:57] there. And in that moment, God came down
[1:22:00] and wiped them off the face of the earth
[1:22:01] and said, "I give up on you."
[1:22:06] Now, in that moment, Brother Brandham
[1:22:08] says, "I see the letters L O V E come
[1:22:11] down in a
[1:22:13] funnel. You know, I'm sure it surprised
[1:22:15] the devil. He's waiting for a
[1:22:19] thunderbolt. And here comes love. He's
[1:22:22] thinking, "It's all over. I've
[1:22:24] conquered. It's done." But see, it's
[1:22:26] something he can never understand.
[1:22:29] Those was his kids.
[1:22:31] Kind of like, I mean, I get it
[1:22:32] sometimes, right? You may Yeah. You may
[1:22:34] look at my kids. I may look at your
[1:22:36] kids.
[1:22:38] If that was my I'll tell you what
[1:22:45] devil's sitting over there going if this
[1:22:46] is my kids. I tell you what I do.
[1:22:52] Lightning. God comes down and goes
[1:22:55] something's got to die.
[1:22:57] Something's got to die. Satan's going
[1:22:59] That's right. Something's got to die.
[1:23:04] He kills a lamb. Wait, what's going on
[1:23:08] here? I thought they were going to die.
[1:23:11] No, he says, "No, I'm going to put
[1:23:15] enmity between your
[1:23:17] seed and their seed." And in that
[1:23:21] moment, he promises a redeemer. And
[1:23:23] Satan don't even realize what's going
[1:23:24] on. All he knows is they ain't dying.
[1:23:27] And it's really bothering him. Listen,
[1:23:29] how many times does Satan say, "Yep,
[1:23:30] they're going to die." mind. God said,
[1:23:31] "No, you don't understand. That is bone
[1:23:33] of my bone. That is flesh of my flesh.
[1:23:36] That is my offspring. That's a seed gene
[1:23:38] of God in there. I'm not giving up. I'm
[1:23:41] not killing them. I'm doing the
[1:23:42] opposite. I'm giving them eternal life."
[1:23:46] Oh, but you fall and you fall and you
[1:23:48] fall and you fall. What do I get?
[1:23:50] Eternal life, forgiveness, grace, and
[1:23:53] mercy tonight. Hallelujah. You have not
[1:23:57] gone too far. You have not sinned away
[1:24:00] your day of grace. Rise above that line.
[1:24:03] Recognize I'm an overcomer.
[1:24:07] How? Why? Because there's a deposit on
[1:24:09] the inside of you that can't help but
[1:24:12] make it back to eternity. Hallelujah.
[1:24:17] He is not giving up on you.
[1:24:20] He said God made a preparation for you.
[1:24:23] I can see him going up the hill packing
[1:24:26] that cross. his little weak body
[1:24:29] staggering as he went up the hill. The
[1:24:31] first thing you know it was whirling
[1:24:33] around him. Death was biting at him
[1:24:35] hard. He's moving on with a cross on his
[1:24:38] back, moving towards Calvary yonder.
[1:24:42] What? Because he had to. Because love
[1:24:46] drove him to
[1:24:48] it. He was determined his plan wasn't
[1:24:50] going to fail. He was determined you
[1:24:53] wouldn't fail. Why? Cuz he loves you.
[1:24:57] He loves you so
[1:25:00] much. Satan loves to come and lie and
[1:25:04] put lies and fears on people. One of the
[1:25:07] things he loves to do is tell them that
[1:25:08] you've gone too far. He'll tell you
[1:25:11] you've crossed the line, that there's no
[1:25:12] hope for you in
[1:25:14] God. I always look at it like this, man.
[1:25:17] If Legion hadn't gone too far, you're
[1:25:19] right.
[1:25:21] I'm not saying stay in that condition.
[1:25:22] You ain't all right. That's right. I'm
[1:25:25] saying that there's hope for you. But
[1:25:27] you don't understand, brother Aaron, the
[1:25:29] sins that I've committed in my life. If
[1:25:31] Mary Magdalene hadn't gone too far, you
[1:25:33] hadn't gone too far.
[1:25:36] If Rahab not only had not gone too far,
[1:25:38] but she ended up even being in the
[1:25:40] lineage of of Christ coming through her.
[1:25:44] You don't think you can be part of the
[1:25:45] bride? All you got to do is get that
[1:25:47] scarlet cord hung out your life. I
[1:25:50] accept the token, Lord. I'mma live under
[1:25:52] this token. I'm going to let this change
[1:25:54] my life. I'm no longer going to try to
[1:25:56] do it on my own cuz I can't do it on my
[1:25:58] own, brother. And I'm not good enough.
[1:25:59] Get in line. You'll never be good
[1:26:02] enough. I'm not good enough. Nobody's
[1:26:04] good enough. But your lamb has been
[1:26:06] accepted. Your lamb was good enough. It
[1:26:09] was more than good enough. It was
[1:26:11] perfect. And I see you. I see you
[1:26:14] through the blood of the lamb.
[1:26:16] Hallelujah.
[1:26:19] Don't accept that lie. Don't accept it
[1:26:21] for your children. You hold on when they
[1:26:23] can't. You believe for them when they
[1:26:26] can't. Brother says, "Satan can't keep
[1:26:28] the revelation down when the spirit
[1:26:30] wants to give it." Listen, darkness upon
[1:26:32] darkness upon darkness can't keep the
[1:26:34] light of God's word from shining when
[1:26:36] the time is right. All devils in hell
[1:26:39] can't keep that light from hitting that
[1:26:41] predestinated seed. It may seem
[1:26:43] impossible, but how about we stop for a
[1:26:45] minute and remember where we were when
[1:26:46] it hit us? How long did it take to find
[1:26:49] you? Where were you living when it found
[1:26:52] you? I'll speak from myself. There is no
[1:26:55] place too low. There is no sin too
[1:26:57] great. There is no life too torn down
[1:26:59] and marred by sin that the hand of
[1:27:01] Almighty God cannot reach down and pick
[1:27:04] you up and change your life in a moment.
[1:27:07] How frustrating it must be for the devil
[1:27:09] to pour decade after decade after decade
[1:27:12] after decade into a life and go, "This
[1:27:14] one's mine." And in one moment's time,
[1:27:17] the Lord Jesus says, "No, sir. He's
[1:27:20] mine. One moment in his presence changes
[1:27:25] everything.
[1:27:27] Hallelujah. You don't got to weep and
[1:27:29] cry and beg like some Catholic for 30
[1:27:31] years. Just give it to him and be done
[1:27:33] with it.
[1:27:35] Hallelujah. It's a gift that he's given
[1:27:38] you.
[1:27:41] I got to move quicker. I'm
[1:27:45] sorry. We serve a determined God. He
[1:27:48] wants a determined people. People with
[1:27:51] grit, people with backbone and
[1:27:52] determination.
[1:27:54] Oh, come on. You know the devil's
[1:27:55] probing at you constantly, trying to get
[1:27:57] you to give up, trying to get you to
[1:27:58] quit, attacking in every way. And his
[1:28:01] storms are blowing. And he sends all
[1:28:03] kind of winds, every type of unbelief
[1:28:06] and every kind of doctrine to to try to
[1:28:08] shake you and move you off the promises.
[1:28:10] Brother Brandham calls them giants. He
[1:28:13] says, "I don't care how much reasoning's
[1:28:14] in it. If it's against God's word, it's
[1:28:16] against it's against God's word. If it's
[1:28:19] against God's word, it's against God's
[1:28:21] word. That's good. I can even understand
[1:28:23] that.
[1:28:25] If an intellectual giant says, "We don't
[1:28:27] need no Holy Ghost. We don't need divine
[1:28:29] healing. I don't care how much
[1:28:30] reasonable it looks. It's contrary to
[1:28:33] the word. God gave the promise." They
[1:28:35] say that was just for the apostles. And
[1:28:38] I love this last sentence. I wonder
[1:28:40] where they get that. You didn't find in
[1:28:43] the Bible. You didn't find it in the
[1:28:45] message, so it came out of your own
[1:28:48] mind.
[1:28:51] They're winds of the devil. Winds that
[1:28:54] question the supernatural. They question
[1:28:56] the Holy Ghost. They question divine
[1:28:58] healing. They question deliverance. They
[1:28:59] question miracles. God don't do those
[1:29:01] things no more. Just where do they get
[1:29:04] that?
[1:29:06] Jude 1:33, "Beloved, when I gave all
[1:29:09] diligence to write unto you of the
[1:29:10] common salvation, it was needful for me
[1:29:12] to write unto you and exhort you that
[1:29:14] you should earnestly contend for the
[1:29:16] faith which was once delivered to the
[1:29:18] saints." In other words, they were
[1:29:19] already changing it. They're already
[1:29:21] formalizing it. They're already calling
[1:29:23] people holy rollers because they were
[1:29:25] acting like they did in the upper room
[1:29:26] just 30 years before. They're already
[1:29:28] saying, "Well, that was just for this
[1:29:30] group and that group and and Jude
[1:29:31] saying, "You got to fight for it.
[1:29:33] People's going to come and tell you.
[1:29:34] They're going to have good arguments.
[1:29:35] They're going to try to talk you out of
[1:29:37] it. But you got to be willing to say,
[1:29:38] "No, I'll remain right here. I'll be
[1:29:40] alive and I'll remain right here. This
[1:29:42] is how it was delivered. This is how I'm
[1:29:44] going to live it. This is how it was
[1:29:45] delivered. This is how I'm going to
[1:29:47] preach it." I'm going to go ahead and
[1:29:48] tell you right now, too many preachers
[1:29:50] think they're chefs. And the truth of
[1:29:51] the matter is preachers are waiters. The
[1:29:53] chef cooked it up. It's just my job to
[1:29:56] bring it to you exactly the way the chef
[1:29:58] prepared it. Quit putting your own
[1:30:01] seasoning in it. quit changing the the
[1:30:03] the ingredients in it. And the recipe
[1:30:05] the recipe works. The recipe works. Just
[1:30:08] deliver the food the way he wants it
[1:30:11] delivered to his people.
[1:30:14] [Applause]
[1:30:22] No
[1:30:24] sir, it's cooked just right.
[1:30:29] Oldfashioned gospel may be looked down
[1:30:31] on, criticized by others. Our worship
[1:30:34] may be mocked by others. Gifts may be
[1:30:36] cast out by others. They want to throw
[1:30:38] out the word Pentecostal like it's a bad
[1:30:39] word. I wear it as a badge of honor. I
[1:30:42] wear it as a badge of honor. That's who
[1:30:45] I am. That's what I was turned back to.
[1:30:48] I'm sorry. I caught the revelation of
[1:30:50] what the message was supposed to do.
[1:30:52] Don't be mad at me. I'm going where it
[1:30:54] led me. I'm going back to the original.
[1:30:57] [Applause]
[1:31:04] We've embraced the fullness of the word.
[1:31:07] That's right. That's why I shout. That's
[1:31:10] why I dance. That's why I rejoice.
[1:31:13] That's why I'm happy. Cuz I can dance
[1:31:15] like David when the word come back. But
[1:31:18] it's
[1:31:19] winds. But the message came in this day
[1:31:21] and it took us back to the original. It
[1:31:24] took us back to Pentecost. That's right.
[1:31:26] The original book of Acts. That's right.
[1:31:31] Took us back to the gospel that Paul
[1:31:33] preached. Not to a partial word and but
[1:31:36] but to a full word. And in that word
[1:31:38] there is correct doctrine. In that word
[1:31:40] is deliverance. In that word is healing.
[1:31:42] In that word is the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:44] Ghost. Yeah. But what it is is the winds
[1:31:46] are trying to rob that word of the power
[1:31:48] of it. And they don't want the
[1:31:50] supernatural
[1:31:51] operating. But somebody has to remain.
[1:31:57] We shall remain true on the word. Amen.
[1:32:02] Somebody's got to contend for the faith
[1:32:04] how it was once delivered. Listen, I'll
[1:32:06] tell you right now, I don't want carnal.
[1:32:09] I don't want work up. I don't want
[1:32:11] Isuza. Right. I don't think anybody
[1:32:14] does, but the word said that we could
[1:32:16] have these things in our church. And I'm
[1:32:18] not willing to throw away the move of
[1:32:20] God and the supernatural because of some
[1:32:21] scarecrow. That's right. I'm not going
[1:32:24] to do Did you know that there was this
[1:32:25] one person who was
[1:32:27] carnal? Okay. There was like 99 of them
[1:32:31] that was completely baptized in the
[1:32:33] spirit and getting deliverance and
[1:32:35] dancing and praising God and worshiping
[1:32:37] God. And you want to throw it all out
[1:32:39] cuz one person was in the flesh.
[1:32:42] So,
[1:32:44] did they enjoy themselves?
[1:32:48] Cuz I think we're allowed to do that in
[1:32:49] church.
[1:32:56] I think it's funny to me. Now, now look,
[1:32:58] once again, please understand that I'm
[1:32:59] in no way uh promoting getting in the
[1:33:01] flesh and just acting crazy. Understand
[1:33:03] that. But I think it's funny how it's
[1:33:06] okay if we get in the flesh everywhere
[1:33:09] else.
[1:33:13] everywhere else.
[1:33:16] But we don't want it to happen in
[1:33:18] church. You do it in church. He got in
[1:33:19] the flesh. I came here in the flesh.
[1:33:25] I drove here that way.
[1:33:28] I live that way. Oh, brother. That's not
[1:33:32] Don't Don't even act like you don't
[1:33:35] Where are you living?
[1:33:42] I'll move on.
[1:33:46] I just know this. We're going to see
[1:33:48] miracles. We're going to see giants
[1:33:50] fall. We're going to have the
[1:33:51] supernatural operating in our midst.
[1:33:53] We're going to see prodals come back.
[1:33:54] We're going to see people bound
[1:33:56] delivered. We're going to see the sick
[1:33:57] healed. And when we do, we're going to
[1:33:59] rejoice in it. We're going to shout in
[1:34:01] it. We're going to dance in it. And if
[1:34:02] you got a problem with it, that's okay.
[1:34:04] God bless you. But that's what we're
[1:34:06] going to do. And I'm going to do it
[1:34:08] before I see it. I'm going to praise him
[1:34:10] because I know it's coming. I'm going to
[1:34:11] do it because I know in this battle
[1:34:14] there's going to be a victory. And many
[1:34:16] times your victory is on the other side
[1:34:18] of your praise. Praise him because he
[1:34:20] deserves it. Praise him because he's
[1:34:22] God. Praise him
[1:34:24] because he is our Lord and
[1:34:28] Savior.
[1:34:33] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham says we
[1:34:35] need the day of old fashioned. God sent
[1:34:37] St. Paul revival and the Bible Holy
[1:34:39] Ghost that a lot of this old chicker
[1:34:42] chocker I don't know what that is but
[1:34:44] I'm almost positive it's a
[1:34:48] negative all this old chicker chocker
[1:34:51] that don't sound
[1:34:52] good halfway formal religion broke up
[1:34:55] and Jesus Christ preaching the power of
[1:34:58] his resurrection where signs and wonders
[1:35:00] and miracles can take place again in the
[1:35:02] church before the end time. It's my
[1:35:04] favorite part of the quote. We are going
[1:35:06] to have it. And then he says, "Get
[1:35:09] that. We are going to have it. Get that.
[1:35:12] All devils out of hell can't stop it.
[1:35:14] For God said it would be here. It's
[1:35:16] going to be here." Let me ask you a
[1:35:19] question. How can you back off the
[1:35:20] supernatural when you're following the
[1:35:22] most supernatural message that ever hit
[1:35:24] the face of the earth?
[1:35:29] It's a strong wind blowing. But I'd like
[1:35:31] to declare tonight, it's going to take a
[1:35:33] stronger wind than this. cuz I ain't
[1:35:35] backing up. I'm going to remain right
[1:35:37] here on the promises he said I could
[1:35:38] have. I'm going to see the gifts in
[1:35:40] operation. I'm going to see the word.
[1:35:42] I'm going to see discernment. I'm going
[1:35:43] to see lives changed because he said we
[1:35:45] could.
[1:35:48] Prophet of God says, "Oh, we have a
[1:35:50] word." I've already read this, but I'm
[1:35:51] reading it again. It's hold fast,
[1:35:53] persevere, don't give up, put on the
[1:35:55] whole armor of God, use every weapon
[1:35:57] he's given us, use every gift at our
[1:36:00] disposal, and look ahead with joy. We
[1:36:05] remain and I'm just going to try to
[1:36:07] close this down. So hold on with me for
[1:36:09] just a minute. We
[1:36:12] remain. Of course it's
[1:36:14] hard. Of course the devil tells you to
[1:36:16] quit. But you can't.
[1:36:20] Man has hurt you. Satan has hurt you.
[1:36:22] Family has hurt you. But you're still
[1:36:24] here.
[1:36:27] You are called to be standing and living
[1:36:31] right now.
[1:36:32] This is your time. This is your hour.
[1:36:36] It's going to take a stronger wind.
[1:36:38] There ain't no wind that can do it
[1:36:39] because it's a seed gene of God that's
[1:36:41] down on the inside of you. And we've
[1:36:43] seen it with the elect down through the
[1:36:45] ages that they had something within them
[1:36:47] that cause them to stand against all the
[1:36:49] odds in their day. Time after time, when
[1:36:51] everyone quits, when it's the darkest of
[1:36:54] moments, there's always somebody that
[1:36:55] says, "I will remain." Because God's
[1:36:59] purpose will be fulfilled every single
[1:37:00] time. That seed gene of God that he put
[1:37:03] down on you is driven to manifestation.
[1:37:06] It's driven when you want to quit. When
[1:37:08] you don't know why you're still here.
[1:37:12] Come on. Why am I still going to that
[1:37:14] church?
[1:37:17] I know it's not here. That's other
[1:37:18] places though. It's just
[1:37:21] because you're driven. Amen. When you
[1:37:24] don't want to be here, you're here
[1:37:27] because you're driven. It's driven to
[1:37:29] overcome. It's being drawn back to
[1:37:31] eternity. I'd like to tell you all that
[1:37:34] stuff Satan's been telling you, all the
[1:37:35] plans he has for you, they don't matter.
[1:37:37] Satan's plans do not matter. The lies he
[1:37:40] tells you does not matter. He says
[1:37:42] you're going to give in. He says that
[1:37:43] you're going to take your own life. He
[1:37:45] says you aren't going to make it in. But
[1:37:46] listen, he doesn't get a vote. This is
[1:37:49] not a democracy. This is a monarchy. And
[1:37:52] the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords
[1:37:54] says, "He's making it. He's making it.
[1:37:57] She's making it. They're coming. They're
[1:37:59] coming back." Devil says, "No, they're
[1:38:00] not. No, they're not." He says, "Shut
[1:38:02] up. This is my kingdom. They're going to
[1:38:05] make it. They're my children. And the
[1:38:08] only thing that matters is what he says
[1:38:10] about you.
[1:38:13] You're going to stand true. You're going
[1:38:16] to overcome. You're going to be
[1:38:18] victorious
[1:38:20] because the Lord has declared it. The
[1:38:22] Lord has thoughts of you. They're going
[1:38:25] to remain. They're going to stand. From
[1:38:29] the very day of
[1:38:31] Pentecost, Satan began his attacks by
[1:38:34] trying to destroy the church of God. And
[1:38:36] I'm going as fast as I can here. False
[1:38:38] doctrines began to be preached. Trinity
[1:38:40] doctrines and false baptisms. And the
[1:38:42] church got formalized. And yet, the true
[1:38:45] seed would remain. The false vine would
[1:38:47] try to defile it, but the saints stood
[1:38:50] the test and they kept the word. We
[1:38:52] could go down through each age here and
[1:38:54] show how Satan would attack. And yet,
[1:38:55] there was always someone that God could
[1:38:57] put his hand on. There was always
[1:39:00] someone. Those that have gone before us,
[1:39:02] they've stood the test. They fought the
[1:39:05] battle and they have a great reward.
[1:39:08] There's a quote here where brother says,
[1:39:09] "What difference does it make if I'm
[1:39:10] living here or if I'm buried out
[1:39:12] yonder?" Amen. For I am already paid the
[1:39:15] penalty of death. I'll be there before
[1:39:17] any man that's living. That's right. It
[1:39:20] says in second Thessalonians 5th
[1:39:22] chapter, I say this to you in the
[1:39:24] commandments of the Lord. We which are
[1:39:26] alive and remain. The coming of the Lord
[1:39:28] shall not hinder or prevent those that
[1:39:30] are asleep. For the trumpet of God shall
[1:39:32] sound, and the dead of Christ shall rise
[1:39:33] first. So what difference does it make
[1:39:36] if I died in the time of Noah? If I died
[1:39:38] in the time of Abraham, if I died in the
[1:39:41] time of the apostles, if I died two
[1:39:43] weeks ago or right now, he says, I'll be
[1:39:47] there in a moment, in a twinkling of an
[1:39:51] eye.
[1:39:53] But that's talking about them.
[1:39:55] Now it's our turn.
[1:39:59] And I know we've reached the height of
[1:40:00] Satan's kingdom. And I know that the
[1:40:03] odds don't look good when you look
[1:40:04] around you.
[1:40:06] 200 million. I always get that number
[1:40:09] mixed up. There's a lot of
[1:40:11] demons released from the river
[1:40:14] Euphrates. But it doesn't really matter
[1:40:16] how evil it is. He said, "I will have a
[1:40:19] church without spider wrinkle." He said
[1:40:23] there would be someone who would be
[1:40:25] alive and remain. The odds don't
[1:40:29] matter. The odds don't matter. He spoke
[1:40:32] it.
[1:40:33] He said it. Because against all odds,
[1:40:36] you stand here today. Against all odds,
[1:40:39] think about your life. Think about the
[1:40:41] Lord protecting your seed, Jean, down
[1:40:43] through. Against all odds, you stand
[1:40:45] here today. You've seen others come and
[1:40:47] go. You've been attacked on every side.
[1:40:49] You've had trials and tribulations. And
[1:40:52] yet, you
[1:40:55] remain. You're still here, still
[1:40:57] standing, and you're just as determined
[1:40:59] today as you've ever been. Satan tells
[1:41:01] you you're not going to make it. He
[1:41:02] tells you that you're going to quit.
[1:41:03] Listen, he's been telling some of y'all
[1:41:05] you was going to quit for 30 years.
[1:41:09] Here you are. When are we just going to
[1:41:11] quit listening
[1:41:13] and turn our attention back to the one
[1:41:15] who's never told us a lie, who's never
[1:41:17] let us down, who's healed us, who's
[1:41:20] delivered us, who's fought for us, who's
[1:41:21] seen us through every situation
[1:41:24] and begin to remain true to that.
[1:41:28] One of the lies that he loves to tell
[1:41:29] people is that you're not a very strong
[1:41:31] Christian and you don't have very strong
[1:41:34] faith. Then can you explain to me how in
[1:41:37] the darkest of all ages, in the midst of
[1:41:41] Satan's Eden, in the hardest age to
[1:41:44] stand that there's ever been, you're
[1:41:46] still standing.
[1:41:48] So, let's have a little honest moment
[1:41:50] tonight. You are an incredible
[1:41:51] Christian. You have strong faith. You
[1:41:53] are an overcomer. You are the cream of
[1:41:56] the crop. God sent his very best down to
[1:41:58] Satan's Eden. Not only are you a good
[1:42:00] Christian, you are the best of the best
[1:42:03] of the best of the best. How can it be?
[1:42:05] I don't know. I know he put you here for
[1:42:07] a reason. I know he put you here to
[1:42:09] manifest the life of Christ in the
[1:42:11] darkest of age. And he said, "They can
[1:42:13] do it. They can do it cuz they're called
[1:42:16] for it. They're chosen for it. They're
[1:42:18] the best that I've got. They'll remain
[1:42:21] when all else falls away. They'll stand
[1:42:23] when everybody else falls. They are my
[1:42:26] best unit. I'm putting you in Leoa.
[1:42:30] That's the truth of the matter. You are
[1:42:33] a good Christian. You do have strong
[1:42:36] faith.
[1:42:37] Hallelujah. You will remain. Why? You're
[1:42:42] predestinated to it. Hallelujah. You've
[1:42:46] been anointed to remain.
[1:42:49] He says, 'Now, here we are in this
[1:42:52] little handful of people, but the
[1:42:54] resurrected Jesus Christ, who represents
[1:42:56] Christianity, is here tonight to prove
[1:42:58] that our
[1:42:59] thoughts, all of you Christians, you're
[1:43:02] on the right side. Absolutely. You can't
[1:43:07] fail. Let that sink in.
[1:43:11] You can't
[1:43:14] fail. When death is no
[1:43:17] more, you're gonna remain.
[1:43:20] When hell is no more, you will remain.
[1:43:24] When sickness is no more, you will
[1:43:27] remain. When Satan is cast into the lake
[1:43:30] of fire, you will remain.
[1:43:36] It's your hour. It's your time. We who
[1:43:40] are alive and remain. Musicians, will
[1:43:42] you come? having done all to stand.
[1:43:46] Stand,
[1:43:48] therefore, you're called for this time.
[1:43:51] You're chosen for this time. That
[1:43:54] besetting sin does not define you. That
[1:43:56] family cycle does not define you. The
[1:43:58] failures of your past do not define you.
[1:44:01] The thoughts you've had in this service
[1:44:02] do not define you. The word of God
[1:44:04] defines you. The word of God says, "You
[1:44:06] are mine. I knew you before you were
[1:44:08] formed in your mother's womb. I have
[1:44:10] called you by name. You are mine. And
[1:44:13] because you belong to him, you cannot
[1:44:16] fail. When everybody else has fallen,
[1:44:19] you will remain.
[1:44:22] Hallelujah.
[1:44:23] Satan don't have enough to stop you.
[1:44:26] Hallelujah.
[1:44:28] Politics are filthy. The world's falling
[1:44:31] apart.
[1:44:33] But it is well with my soul.
[1:44:36] It is well with my soul.
[1:44:38] Hallelujah. Day of Satan. He's going on
[1:44:42] his final
[1:44:43] ride and he's saying, "I can't be
[1:44:47] stopped. I can't be
[1:44:50] stopped. I'm taking everybody with me.
[1:44:53] I'm going about like a roaring line." He
[1:44:55] says, "Give up your
[1:44:57] birthight. Give up your
[1:44:59] promises." I'm drawing a line in the
[1:45:01] sand tonight.
[1:45:03] I'm drawing a line in the sand and I'm
[1:45:06] asking you, who will remain with me? who
[1:45:09] will remain with me in the final days of
[1:45:11] the darkest age and say, "I ain't
[1:45:13] backing up one inch. I ain't giving up
[1:45:16] one promise. He's still my healer. I've
[1:45:18] been sick 15 years and he's my healer.
[1:45:20] He's still bringing my son back. He's
[1:45:22] been out 20 years, but he's still coming
[1:45:24] back. I still got the Holy Ghost despite
[1:45:27] what the devil said. I'm going to stand
[1:45:28] for the promises. I'm going to stand for
[1:45:30] the moving of the spirit. I'm drawing a
[1:45:32] line in the sand and I'm crossing over
[1:45:35] and I'm not going back tonight." We
[1:45:38] shall remain. Hallelujah. We shall
[1:45:41] remain.
[1:45:42] [Applause]
[1:45:45] Oh my. Before I give him the microphone,
[1:45:48] I'm going to tell a little story. You've
[1:45:51] heard
[1:45:53] it. Francis Scott
[1:45:56] Key, Battle of Fort Mckenry. He was a
[1:45:59] 35-year-old American lawyer.
[1:46:02] He boarded a flagship of the British
[1:46:05] fleet on the Chesapeake Bay in hopes of
[1:46:07] persuading the British to release a
[1:46:08] friend of his who had been arrested. And
[1:46:10] actually his tactics
[1:46:13] worked. They released his friend, but
[1:46:16] that because they had knowledge of the
[1:46:17] impending attack, they let them go back
[1:46:20] to their own ship, but they had to stay
[1:46:21] there under guard until the battle was
[1:46:24] over. They wouldn't let him leave. And
[1:46:26] so he's standing there on his ship that
[1:46:28] night, and you know, he pinned some very
[1:46:30] famous words. as we call it, the Star
[1:46:31] Spangled
[1:46:33] Banner. And he would write, "On
[1:46:36] September 13th, as the barrage of Fort
[1:46:38] Henry began 8 miles away, it seemed as
[1:46:40] though Mother Earth had opened up and
[1:46:43] was vomiting shot and shell in a sheet
[1:46:45] of fire and brimstone," Key wrote. But
[1:46:48] when darkness arrived, Key saw only red
[1:46:52] erupting in the night sky. Given the
[1:46:54] scale of the attack, he was certain the
[1:46:56] British would win. The hours passed
[1:46:59] slowly but in the clearing
[1:47:02] smoke of dawn's early light.
[1:47:07] But I read that and I got to thinking
[1:47:08] about the saints down through the ages.
[1:47:10] And it's just my imagination. Just allow
[1:47:12] me to run with it for a minute. And all
[1:47:15] the saints from past ages gathered on
[1:47:17] they're there in the grand stands
[1:47:18] looking over the banister looking down
[1:47:20] at earth.
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:23] And every once in a while, Brother
[1:47:25] Brandon would describe it as like a when
[1:47:26] light came forth like a Roman candle.
[1:47:29] And every once in a while, they'd see
[1:47:31] and they go, "Oh, there's light. Oh,
[1:47:33] there's still people standing. Do y'all
[1:47:35] see that? They were there. They were
[1:47:37] there." And it get dark for a
[1:47:40] while. Look. Look. Do you see that?
[1:47:43] They're still standing. There was light.
[1:47:45] There was
[1:47:46] light. Luther's age. Oh, they're coming
[1:47:50] out. They're coming out.
[1:47:56] Martin
[1:47:57] Wesley
[1:47:59] Luther and then in
[1:48:03] Leoa. Biggest flash yet. Did you see
[1:48:07] that? Oh, it lit up everything.
[1:48:10] Everything was illuminated. We got to be
[1:48:11] close now. We got to be close now. But
[1:48:15] then darkness and darkness and we're
[1:48:18] some 47 years past 1977. And I caught
[1:48:22] the hour of darkness past where even a
[1:48:24] prophet could see beyond. It was so
[1:48:26] dark. Darkness. And they're
[1:48:29] looking. They're
[1:48:31] looking. Did they hold
[1:48:33] on? Did they make
[1:48:36] it? Is there anybody still
[1:48:39] there? But on that bright and cloudless
[1:48:42] morning in dawn's early light, when the
[1:48:45] sun comes up, I come here. Come look.
[1:48:49] There's a people still standing. They
[1:48:52] remained. They held on. They didn't
[1:48:55] surrender. They stood the test in the
[1:48:58] darkest of time. They stood true. We
[1:49:01] didn't give up. We didn't back up. But
[1:49:03] we remain today on the word of God. We
[1:49:06] remain on the promises. And we have won
[1:49:09] the victory in Jesus' name. Stand and
[1:49:13] remain tonight. Hallelujah.
