[59:00] and me
[59:03] God bless you
[59:05] what an incredible service last night
[59:10] I know you were blessed I was blessed
[59:13] I when I saw
[59:16] Andrew speaking on
[59:18] when Jesus was at its weakest
[59:21] I could I could kind of understand and
[59:24] so we are we're very
[59:26] I just I just was quite moved by that
[59:29] and so
[59:30] I so enjoyed that Andrew thank you so
[59:33] much
[59:34] I enjoyed last week when when
[59:40] Hallelujah brain's not working
[59:43] William
[59:45] preached on counting the cost
[59:48] amen that cost goes a couple different
[59:50] ways
[59:52] amen and so sometimes we think well I've
[59:54] counted the cost in serving the lord and
[59:57] it's cost me a lot
[59:59] what if you don't went the other way
[1:00:03] it would have been a tremendous cost in
[1:00:05] it would have not only cost you but it
[1:00:07] cost you generations and so we thank you
[1:00:10] for that I'm a bit weak this morning
[1:00:12] thought something all week and and so if
[1:00:16] you would just pull with me we'll we
[1:00:19] will try to bless you in some way I'd
[1:00:22] like to speak to you on a new
[1:00:24] Administration
[1:00:26] I've never never went this way
[1:00:28] but the Lord I was going to preach this
[1:00:31] at Ohio and the Lord changed my mind
[1:00:34] there we had a wonderful meeting and
[1:00:36] then and then where this is what we get
[1:00:39] today so amen we just pray that it will
[1:00:42] be a blessing to you we'd like to
[1:00:44] welcome brother Joel and Sister Sarah
[1:00:46] they've made some thoughts of coming our
[1:00:49] way and so we we welcome you and I know
[1:00:54] it's some bitter sweetness that is
[1:00:55] involved there and God is moving in a
[1:00:58] lot of directions and so we pray that
[1:01:01] God would just help you in your move
[1:01:04] with jobs and homes and and schools and
[1:01:07] all of those kinds of things and so we
[1:01:09] welcome you here and we thank you I I so
[1:01:13] I so love both of your fathers and ones
[1:01:16] in Ohio one's in North Carolina God
[1:01:18] bless you we we love you we'll do our
[1:01:21] best to Pastor you and uh and so we'll
[1:01:25] do we'll do our best and so amen God
[1:01:28] rich in his Mercy give me a little bit
[1:01:30] longer time I'll do my best and if he
[1:01:32] takes me home Andrew will do his best
[1:01:34] and so that's the way we look at it
[1:01:37] don't we
[1:01:38] amen if you will look with me in
[1:01:40] Proverbs chapter 42 and verse 1 you'll
[1:01:44] quickly recognize this as a text
[1:01:47] for the Deep colath to the Deep
[1:01:50] the reason I want to read this scripture
[1:01:52] is because brother Branham is standing
[1:01:54] in one of the greatest Halls of the
[1:01:57] United States of America it's a building
[1:01:59] of phenomenal importance
[1:02:02] and as you saw last night I didn't know
[1:02:05] that that was going to be played but as
[1:02:07] you saw last night before the service
[1:02:09] the prayer line to which that even
[1:02:11] brother Garber brother Garber from our
[1:02:14] area was praying for Revival
[1:02:16] brother Branham preaches a deep
[1:02:19] calls to the Deep
[1:02:22] I'm thankful when I'm saying this that
[1:02:25] you have a deep on the inside of you
[1:02:28] that is calling for more and that means
[1:02:32] that deep inside of you as it's calling
[1:02:35] for more means there's more for us and
[1:02:37] so amen
[1:02:41] as the heart paneth after the water
[1:02:44] Brooks
[1:02:46] so panteth my soul after thee oh God
[1:02:52] my soul thirsteth for God for the Living
[1:02:55] God
[1:02:57] When shall I come and appear before God
[1:03:02] my tears and my meat and night day and
[1:03:06] night while they continually say unto me
[1:03:08] where is thy God
[1:03:10] when I remember these things I pour out
[1:03:13] my soul in thee and I have gone with the
[1:03:16] multitude I have went with them to the
[1:03:18] house of God
[1:03:19] and with the voice of joy and praise and
[1:03:22] with a multitude that keep holy day
[1:03:26] why art thou cast down O my soul and why
[1:03:29] aren't thou disquiet it in me
[1:03:31] hope thou in God for I shall yet Praise
[1:03:35] Him
[1:03:36] for the help of his countenance oh my
[1:03:40] God my soul is cast down Within Me
[1:03:43] therefore will I remember thee in the
[1:03:45] land of Jordan and of Hermes
[1:03:49] and in the hill of my czar
[1:03:51] deep calleth unto the Deep at the noise
[1:03:55] of thy water spouts all thy waves and
[1:03:59] Billows are gone over me Revelations
[1:04:03] chapter 21 and verse 1. this is a vision
[1:04:07] that is yet to be fulfilled but we're a
[1:04:10] part of it
[1:04:11] and I saw a new Heaven
[1:04:15] and a new Earth
[1:04:18] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[1:04:20] were passed away and there was no more
[1:04:23] sea
[1:04:24] and I John saw the holy city the New
[1:04:27] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:04:29] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:04:32] her husband
[1:04:33] and I heard a great voice out of Heaven
[1:04:35] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[1:04:38] with men and he will dwell with them and
[1:04:41] they shall be his people and God himself
[1:04:44] shall be with them and be their God
[1:04:46] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[1:04:49] their eyes and there shall be no more
[1:04:52] death neither sorrow nor crying neither
[1:04:55] shall there be any more pain for the
[1:04:58] former things are passed away
[1:05:01] and he that sat upon the throne said
[1:05:03] behold I make all things new
[1:05:05] and he said unto me right for these
[1:05:08] words are true and faithful and he said
[1:05:11] unto me it is done notice these next
[1:05:13] words I am Alpha and Omega the beginning
[1:05:17] and the end and I give unto him that is
[1:05:20] a thirst
[1:05:22] of the Fountain of Water of Life freely
[1:05:26] and you remember what we just read
[1:05:28] psalms 42. and he that overcometh shall
[1:05:33] inherit all things and I will be his God
[1:05:37] and he shall be my son you may be seated
[1:05:41] today
[1:05:44] in Saint John chapter 1 and verse 1 John
[1:05:47] is under the eagle anointing so he looks
[1:05:50] at Matthew Mark Luke and John are the
[1:05:53] four guards to the temple each one of
[1:05:56] them are anointed in a different way but
[1:05:59] John as he's writing he's under a
[1:06:01] prophetic anointing an eagle anointing
[1:06:04] and notice how he begins to say it in
[1:06:08] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:06:11] was with God and the Word was God the
[1:06:17] same was in the beginning with god
[1:06:19] notice these words all things were made
[1:06:23] by him and without him was not anything
[1:06:27] that was made
[1:06:31] made that was made
[1:06:33] Saint John chapter 14. now this is Jesus
[1:06:36] turning to his disciples and he's and
[1:06:40] he's operating under this Administration
[1:06:44] notice what he says let not your heart
[1:06:47] be troubled
[1:06:50] you believe in God
[1:06:52] believe also in me
[1:06:55] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:06:59] no man could say these words quite like
[1:07:01] he was saying
[1:07:03] there wasn't another man on the earth
[1:07:06] could say these words he's the author of
[1:07:09] the book
[1:07:14] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:07:17] brother Brown said he was not talking
[1:07:19] about brick and mortar
[1:07:22] he said if it were not so I would have
[1:07:24] told you
[1:07:26] I go to prepare a place for you
[1:07:31] and if I'd go and prepare a place for
[1:07:33] you I will come and again receive you
[1:07:36] unto myself that where I am there you
[1:07:41] may be also I like that don't you
[1:07:45] he's not saying might be also or or even
[1:07:50] an if
[1:07:54] because let me let me just say this to
[1:07:57] you when he said let there be a son
[1:08:03] did it not come to pass
[1:08:05] let there be a universe did it not come
[1:08:09] to pass
[1:08:10] when he began to say let there be light
[1:08:13] did it come to pass
[1:08:16] so when he says there you may be also it
[1:08:21] will come to pass
[1:08:25] and whether I go you know and Thomas
[1:08:28] saith unto him Lord we know not whether
[1:08:32] thou goest and how can we know the way
[1:08:34] and Jesus saith unto him I am the way
[1:08:39] quite a bold statement nobody else could
[1:08:42] say that like that
[1:08:44] I am the way
[1:08:47] there's no other way other than Jesus
[1:08:55] many ways but here's the way
[1:08:59] and the life
[1:09:00] and no man cometh to the father
[1:09:03] but by me
[1:09:06] and if you'd known me you should have
[1:09:09] known my father also and from henceforth
[1:09:12] you know him
[1:09:14] and have seen him
[1:09:16] in Matthew chapter 12 and verse 23 he's
[1:09:20] going to talk about
[1:09:22] Two Worlds or two kingdoms
[1:09:26] and all the people were amazed and said
[1:09:29] is not this the son of David
[1:09:34] but when the Pharisees heard it they
[1:09:37] said this fella doth not cast out Devils
[1:09:40] but by Beelzebub
[1:09:44] the prince of devils they identified
[1:09:48] where they were from
[1:09:53] by the reaction that they had
[1:09:58] are you with me now this nation has
[1:10:02] identified where she's headed to
[1:10:05] by the reaction of how she treated her
[1:10:08] prophet
[1:10:12] and Jesus knew their thoughts and said
[1:10:14] to them every Kingdom
[1:10:17] divided it against itself is brought to
[1:10:20] Desolation every city or house divided
[1:10:23] against itself shall not stand
[1:10:27] and if Satan cast out Satan he is
[1:10:31] divided against his health and how shall
[1:10:34] then his kingdom stand
[1:10:37] and if I by be also Bob cast out Devils
[1:10:41] by whom now notice he pins them now by
[1:10:45] whom do your children
[1:10:49] cast them out therefore they shall be
[1:10:52] your judges
[1:10:54] but if I cast out Devils by the spirit
[1:10:56] of God then the kingdom of God
[1:11:01] is come unto you
[1:11:05] there came a dispensational change
[1:11:09] if I if I cast them out by the kingdom
[1:11:13] of God and you know where you're
[1:11:15] standing
[1:11:17] you call me Beyonce Bob
[1:11:22] and I am from God
[1:11:27] or else how can one enter into a strong
[1:11:30] house a man's house and spoil his Goods
[1:11:33] except he buying the strong man he's
[1:11:37] going to explain the new birth
[1:11:42] or else how can a one enter into a
[1:11:45] strong man's house spall these Goods
[1:11:48] except he first bind the strong man and
[1:11:51] then he spall his house
[1:11:53] he that is not with me
[1:11:56] is against me
[1:11:59] and he gathereth not with the scattered
[1:12:04] abroad
[1:12:07] we have watched if you've got any age to
[1:12:09] you at all
[1:12:11] you have watched different
[1:12:13] administrations come
[1:12:15] there's some order of how they do it
[1:12:18] the precedent
[1:12:20] of course has all of these men and all
[1:12:22] of his staff and mostly when a president
[1:12:25] is elected there's a certain party
[1:12:28] that that takes a halt there's a certain
[1:12:30] inspiration that grabs and many of those
[1:12:33] people
[1:12:35] and then a new leader comes in
[1:12:38] and especially if it's from a different
[1:12:40] party
[1:12:41] there's a transition of power generally
[1:12:45] about 30 days
[1:12:47] the older president brings the the newly
[1:12:51] elect President up to Oregon and he he
[1:12:55] privies him to secrets that are going on
[1:12:58] in the Earth
[1:13:00] things that the average citizen no way
[1:13:04] should be able to know
[1:13:07] and and he brings him to the order of
[1:13:09] different leaders all over the world
[1:13:12] and and he begins to tell them that this
[1:13:15] is going on in a certain country and
[1:13:17] these this country's receiving nuclear
[1:13:20] power or this economy is falling apart
[1:13:22] and he begins to tell them how that he's
[1:13:25] done business so that the transition of
[1:13:29] power goes from one to another
[1:13:32] and then on the day there's an
[1:13:34] inauguration and there's a speech that
[1:13:36] is given there's a swearing in and and
[1:13:39] literally tens of thousands of people
[1:13:41] will watch the new rise of the leader
[1:13:45] and so
[1:13:48] brother Branham or even our our
[1:13:51] scripture tells us that God calls men to
[1:13:54] rise
[1:13:55] and he causes them to fall
[1:13:59] now we must remember that this world
[1:14:04] is ruled by Satan
[1:14:08] it's ruled by Satan we're we're only
[1:14:12] citizens of another kingdom we fly our
[1:14:15] flag because we identify it as this
[1:14:19] nation and we we identify brother Brown
[1:14:22] will use the term I'm proud to be an
[1:14:24] American I'm I'm proud of and he said I
[1:14:27] I stand with her inner in her strength
[1:14:30] and I stand with her in her shame
[1:14:33] but he would also call this nation a
[1:14:36] rotten Nation a corrupt government and
[1:14:40] so we realize that men as they rise the
[1:14:43] more corrupt that they get
[1:14:45] it is because influence of power is
[1:14:49] pushing them in a certain direction now
[1:14:52] God allows these men I'm not telling you
[1:14:54] your vote don't have a account but God
[1:14:57] causes these men to come on the scene at
[1:15:00] a certain time
[1:15:02] boy presidents rise and fulfill a vision
[1:15:06] because of the Catholic church is rising
[1:15:09] and it's on its move and in this nation
[1:15:12] today we can see that seeds are now
[1:15:16] fulfilled where we have a where we have
[1:15:19] a court system that is basically ruled
[1:15:22] by the Catholic Church
[1:15:24] we have a precedent that is a Catholic
[1:15:27] man
[1:15:28] but we notice the influence of the
[1:15:30] people around him he has placed people
[1:15:34] in so many directions of his own cabinet
[1:15:37] that represents Sodom
[1:15:43] transgender
[1:15:46] it represents because it's saying that
[1:15:49] this is the influence Over America in
[1:15:53] this day I say those things and I say
[1:15:56] this the reason that they could come to
[1:15:58] that spot
[1:16:00] is because they turned down the message
[1:16:05] [Music]
[1:16:06] they they turned down the message to
[1:16:08] where that pulpits became weak all
[1:16:11] across America
[1:16:13] the the the the
[1:16:15] Ten Commandments are no longer hung in
[1:16:19] so many of our courtrooms it's it's no
[1:16:22] longer hung in our nation's capital it's
[1:16:25] no longer prayer taking place in our in
[1:16:29] her great Halls of Congress
[1:16:32] we're not a Christian Nation anymore
[1:16:37] we may pray here and have the Liberty to
[1:16:40] preach the way that we preach
[1:16:42] but even in that you got to use a little
[1:16:44] common sense with it
[1:16:49] because we're preaching to the world now
[1:16:52] and so you understand that we recognize
[1:16:56] Sodom is here
[1:16:59] but I must let you know that we're no
[1:17:02] longer Church
[1:17:03] [Music]
[1:17:09] you see Messengers have came
[1:17:12] the Apostle Paul was a new
[1:17:14] Administration
[1:17:16] and so he took the scriptures and wrote
[1:17:18] basically 14 books of the Bible and laid
[1:17:22] out how the church should be in order
[1:17:27] are you with me
[1:17:29] when when Andrew read Hebrews chapter 12
[1:17:31] last night Paul was looking for the
[1:17:34] Rapture to take place at any time
[1:17:37] and he would scream let us run but just
[1:17:40] a few said we have come to the Mount
[1:17:43] Zion
[1:17:45] so they were under expectation of
[1:17:48] rapture at any moment but you see that
[1:17:51] was only the first part of the book
[1:17:53] there must come Messengers all the way
[1:17:56] down through men of incredible influence
[1:18:00] hand-picked by God
[1:18:02] irenius
[1:18:06] brother random even in his own nature
[1:18:08] would have picked polycarp
[1:18:10] but God picked iranias
[1:18:13] Saint Martin whom brother Branham says
[1:18:16] that had more miracles than even Jesus
[1:18:18] Christ
[1:18:21] are you with me raise more back to life
[1:18:24] had a phenomenal Ministry these men
[1:18:27] shook the Earth
[1:18:30] Martin Luther John Wesley
[1:18:35] Pentecost was poured out at Azusa Street
[1:18:39] God poured his Spirit out
[1:18:42] but remember in Daniel the book had been
[1:18:45] sealed
[1:18:47] and the Mysteries would be revealed to
[1:18:50] the Bride of Jesus Christ and it would
[1:18:53] call for a new Administration
[1:18:57] because basically churches and and
[1:19:00] Prophets and and reformers would rise
[1:19:03] but the Revival would only last for a
[1:19:06] short time and men would get into it
[1:19:09] organize the churches
[1:19:14] and the spirit of God would leave
[1:19:18] oh there would be great men that would
[1:19:20] rise under these Messengers and have the
[1:19:23] influence of the message in their life
[1:19:25] and they would shake the Earth
[1:19:29] but generally the leader of these of
[1:19:32] these systems
[1:19:35] they wouldn't want nothing to do with
[1:19:37] John Wesley no more
[1:19:41] a man named Spurgeon would rise but it
[1:19:44] wouldn't take many years till they
[1:19:45] wouldn't want nothing to do with
[1:19:47] Spurgeon
[1:19:49] foreign
[1:19:53] the world today wouldn't want nothing to
[1:19:56] do with William Branham
[1:20:00] they love what we saw last night but let
[1:20:03] me just say this to you when it came to
[1:20:05] the word they always excused themselves
[1:20:08] he went off of the word
[1:20:11] [Applause]
[1:20:12] because they're boards and their
[1:20:14] Association and their influence of Sodom
[1:20:20] they can't line up with the word because
[1:20:22] of the life that was preached here last
[1:20:25] night
[1:20:28] we live in a very unfit age but God has
[1:20:32] called for a bride that will come out of
[1:20:36] this that will be without spot or
[1:20:39] blemish
[1:20:40] [Applause]
[1:20:50] notice this would be the changing
[1:20:54] this would be the changing
[1:20:57] I no longer call you a church
[1:21:01] I call you bright
[1:21:04] this bride would be God's crowning
[1:21:08] achievement in this day
[1:21:11] this bride would be given checkbook
[1:21:14] Authority not in heaven but now
[1:21:18] it would be given life
[1:21:21] and to be given life we would be a
[1:21:24] people that are called out people
[1:21:27] and if I can say this if I can say this
[1:21:30] to where you understand it we needed the
[1:21:33] king of our heart that original King
[1:21:37] to die
[1:21:40] we needed that original life to die we
[1:21:45] needed a new purse
[1:21:47] and the new king
[1:21:50] the new Administration move in to our
[1:21:54] lives and we're no longer under that old
[1:21:57] headship anymore
[1:22:00] well brother Ron this is how I feel
[1:22:02] doesn't matter how you feel this is how
[1:22:04] I think it doesn't matter how you think
[1:22:08] all right
[1:22:10] we serve a different order
[1:22:19] it's not going to be socially accepted
[1:22:22] we must come to our thoughts
[1:22:26] this is not it for everybody
[1:22:32] sometimes we think well we've got to
[1:22:34] make it listen don't try to polish the
[1:22:37] message up
[1:22:40] don't try to polish it up to make it
[1:22:43] politically correct
[1:22:45] don't try to introduce a bunch of
[1:22:47] psychology and intellectualism to try to
[1:22:50] polish up make believers
[1:22:55] I am determined to just preach the word
[1:22:59] and if you if you feed bride food
[1:23:09] we live in a state to where you're not
[1:23:11] supposed to date a bait
[1:23:14] you're not supposed to
[1:23:17] uh bait deer bait bear
[1:23:23] but we live in a different order we
[1:23:26] baked bride
[1:23:38] we don't have hot dog suppers
[1:23:40] we don't have open houses
[1:23:43] we don't have sing-alongs
[1:23:46] what
[1:23:48] we we preach bride message
[1:23:52] and they will come
[1:23:57] I think it's something about they built
[1:24:00] a baseball field somewhere in the middle
[1:24:01] of nowhere and they said they'll come
[1:24:07] you just preach bright material
[1:24:10] and they will come
[1:24:13] listen we have a hungry people
[1:24:17] they want to hear the word
[1:24:19] they want to hear it in passion
[1:24:22] I know
[1:24:24] I don't want to hear a bad letter
[1:24:27] [Applause]
[1:24:28] I don't want some easy belief here
[1:24:31] someone
[1:24:32] I want something under a new
[1:24:34] Administration
[1:24:36] a prophetic word to a prophetic people
[1:24:41] a special class
[1:24:44] no one bad worshiper pretend worship I
[1:24:47] want real passionate worship
[1:24:50] I won't worship that brings the presence
[1:24:53] of God down
[1:24:58] that's what I want
[1:25:01] and we can worship from our soul
[1:25:05] I'm not interested in pleasing everybody
[1:25:07] around me I want to please him
[1:25:10] [Applause]
[1:25:12] the ship is to please God
[1:25:14] [Music]
[1:25:16] I may not be able to sing my way out of
[1:25:19] a tin can it don't matter
[1:25:21] well he can't hear me amen it don't
[1:25:24] matter he's listening
[1:25:26] [Applause]
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:42] we've been here
[1:25:45] 50 years
[1:25:47] this is our 50th anniversary year
[1:25:52] we're not on this hill
[1:25:55] to be the biggest church in this
[1:25:57] community
[1:25:59] that's not what our interest is
[1:26:02] to be honest with you that's not what
[1:26:04] our interest is
[1:26:11] our interest is in him
[1:26:17] not only that I want that in your
[1:26:19] personal life
[1:26:22] as a church we're under a new
[1:26:24] Administration
[1:26:26] I just was that brother
[1:26:30] Ray Ericksons and and he now has become
[1:26:33] senior pastor and brother Wayne is now
[1:26:36] pastor of that church
[1:26:38] and that is a new Administration
[1:26:42] and that new Administration he he may
[1:26:44] have different ways under a different
[1:26:47] anointing and he'll lead that church
[1:26:49] under what God's leading him to do
[1:26:53] different insights on certain things
[1:26:56] it won't change the building
[1:26:59] but God has a way of lifting it to
[1:27:02] another Realm
[1:27:04] are you with me as a way of lifting it
[1:27:07] to another Realm
[1:27:09] Brother Ray has been a phenomenal
[1:27:10] pasture but now brother Wayne God has
[1:27:13] raised him up
[1:27:15] and he'll he'll lift him on the hat
[1:27:17] listen and if it comes time there'll be
[1:27:19] another man rise up
[1:27:22] and if God's doing and it's not
[1:27:24] organization doing it
[1:27:26] it's bringing the sea to the
[1:27:28] identification of Bride and material
[1:27:33] we've been through that
[1:27:35] brother Homer the founder of our of this
[1:27:38] church did a phenomenal work
[1:27:42] and he saw he saw a certain thing of
[1:27:44] that he needed to there were certain
[1:27:47] things that he didn't understand and he
[1:27:48] would tell me certain things I don't
[1:27:50] know how to preach and so I prayed and I
[1:27:54] prayed he actually invited several other
[1:27:55] guys to come but God led us to be here
[1:27:58] we've been here 23 years now 24 years
[1:28:02] and
[1:28:03] and and I hope by God's grace God's
[1:28:06] allowed us to to climb a little higher
[1:28:08] [Music]
[1:28:10] and when cancer struck we we had a vote
[1:28:13] here
[1:28:14] well I wasn't here to give a vote too
[1:28:16] late
[1:28:18] and we had a vote here it made brother
[1:28:21] Andrew co-pastor with me no not two
[1:28:23] heads
[1:28:25] but brother Andrew has you can tell by
[1:28:28] his Me by his meetings Has Lifted and
[1:28:31] we've got a team
[1:28:35] because it's more than a man's
[1:28:37] Administration that's what I'm driving
[1:28:39] at it's not built by a man it's not
[1:28:43] instituted by a man
[1:28:45] [Applause]
[1:28:55] did that do away with brother Homer no
[1:28:59] that doesn't disregard him whatsoever
[1:29:01] did it do away with Brother Ray Erickson
[1:29:03] no as a matter of fact it lifts them
[1:29:10] God takes me by the way of the Grave it
[1:29:13] won't do away with me and the work that
[1:29:15] I have done here
[1:29:17] but it's a continuation
[1:29:21] why did you put that in when God took
[1:29:24] brother Branham
[1:29:26] this is where I was going when God took
[1:29:29] the prophet
[1:29:31] the message had already got delivered
[1:29:35] and the message is the new
[1:29:36] Administration
[1:29:39] she'll be a super Church a super race
[1:29:46] she'll be the final voice to the final
[1:29:49] age she's bone of his bones she's life
[1:29:53] of his life she's spirit
[1:29:57] she is him
[1:29:59] [Applause]
[1:30:00] this is Christ in bright form
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:17] did I say that all right
[1:30:27] God brings a new order
[1:30:31] it brings a new order
[1:30:33] he establishes
[1:30:36] the message established us of what the
[1:30:39] godhead was
[1:30:41] it three
[1:30:43] it wasn't one like your finger
[1:30:48] established us the serpency
[1:30:51] and took us through the trail of the
[1:30:53] serpent all the way from the beginning
[1:30:55] all the way to the end
[1:30:59] then he began to lay out the Mysteries
[1:31:03] all right
[1:31:05] now let me just say
[1:31:07] even The Messengers before knew there
[1:31:10] were certain things that they couldn't
[1:31:11] touch
[1:31:14] I like a statement of Spurgeon Spurgeon
[1:31:17] was one of the first ones
[1:31:21] that would have sermons written down in
[1:31:24] in paper form
[1:31:26] before he would preach
[1:31:28] and and brother Shannon this is
[1:31:30] mind-boggling to me
[1:31:32] but they would copy a hundred thousand
[1:31:37] tablets of his sermon before he would
[1:31:40] preach on Sunday
[1:31:43] Spurgeon was quite a preacher he was
[1:31:45] Prince of preachers is what they said
[1:31:47] and they would distribute those fly
[1:31:49] Leafs all over London and all over the
[1:31:52] place still being distributed
[1:31:56] but he said something that was very
[1:31:58] interesting
[1:31:59] he said
[1:32:00] God put it in my heart
[1:32:03] to write sermons down
[1:32:06] but he said there will come a time
[1:32:09] that they'll catch a man's voice
[1:32:14] to where they can preserve his voice
[1:32:19] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:32:21] seventh angel
[1:32:24] and on your first sermon that you hear
[1:32:28] first couple paragraphs we've got a
[1:32:31] gadget
[1:32:34] and they were capturing brother
[1:32:36] branham's voice
[1:32:39] for many of those audiences it just
[1:32:43] passed over their head and brother
[1:32:44] Brandon will say over and over again
[1:32:46] don't miss it don't miss it don't miss
[1:32:50] it
[1:32:51] let me give you an idea I sat with
[1:32:54] brother Garber at breakfast
[1:32:57] I wanted to meet him
[1:33:00] because he had significance to this area
[1:33:04] how many met brother Garber
[1:33:06] yeah
[1:33:07] he had significance to this area and he
[1:33:10] was the last one in the prayer line and
[1:33:12] deep calleth of the deep
[1:33:14] I met him at LNS him he's ever been
[1:33:17] there
[1:33:19] actually brother Branham ate there so
[1:33:21] that'd be interesting for you to know
[1:33:22] well anyway
[1:33:24] I met him there for breakfast he wasn't
[1:33:27] really interested too much in really
[1:33:29] talking to me he seemed he was an older
[1:33:31] man he was busy with his with his day
[1:33:34] and
[1:33:35] I I wanted to ask him about I want to
[1:33:38] ask him about what he experienced there
[1:33:40] and then what the Revival was like
[1:33:42] because I know that brother Brown prayed
[1:33:45] for him and pronounced a Revival there
[1:33:47] had to be a Revival
[1:33:49] and so I asked him about meeting him
[1:33:52] brother Branham and I asked him I asked
[1:33:54] him about the angel
[1:33:56] and he and he said these words to him he
[1:33:58] said I saw the angel
[1:34:00] he said a lot of us saw the angel he
[1:34:04] said he stood behind brother Branham or
[1:34:06] moved throughout the audience Pillar of
[1:34:08] Fire would move through the audience
[1:34:10] he was known as the man with the angel
[1:34:16] and I asked him I said was there any
[1:34:18] others on the scene because I knew was
[1:34:21] there any others on the scene that had
[1:34:22] an angel he said no of course not there
[1:34:24] wasn't nobody else with an angel brother
[1:34:26] Branham met the angel and that angel
[1:34:28] accompanied on the pulpit I said what
[1:34:30] did he look like he said it looked a bit
[1:34:32] like brother Branham
[1:34:36] and so
[1:34:39] I said what did you feel he said I've
[1:34:41] never felt God like I felt on that stage
[1:34:45] I said well well
[1:34:47] what happened he said well I came home
[1:34:50] and he said we had two weeks of the
[1:34:52] greatest Revival
[1:34:54] he said I think this area has ever had
[1:34:56] he didn't know about this church
[1:35:00] and he said I think we had two weeks of
[1:35:02] the greatest Revival that's ever had
[1:35:04] brother Charles I think your dad knew
[1:35:06] him well so anyway he he said he said we
[1:35:10] had a phenomenal Revival he said people
[1:35:12] parked five miles away and walked into
[1:35:15] the church
[1:35:18] he said two weeks and it was gone
[1:35:22] he said it just evaporated
[1:35:26] kind of shook his head he said it never
[1:35:29] came back
[1:35:34] and he just kind of didn't want to talk
[1:35:35] no more
[1:35:38] well I have the answer
[1:35:42] I have the answer
[1:35:44] if you don't welcome the word
[1:35:47] he comes by invitation
[1:35:51] he comes by invitation
[1:35:54] now you see he went to Simon's house by
[1:35:57] invitation
[1:36:00] but they didn't welcome him
[1:36:03] but he came because a girl
[1:36:06] was coming there and she was now going
[1:36:09] to live under a new Administration
[1:36:13] she came in one way and she left out a
[1:36:16] different way
[1:36:17] [Applause]
[1:36:26] Hallelujah and if you allow him in your
[1:36:29] life and he becomes the king of your
[1:36:31] heart you may come one way
[1:36:36] and you may be determined to stay that
[1:36:38] way but if that old man dies
[1:36:43] if the old man dies
[1:36:46] you can't have the old man and the new
[1:36:48] man at the same time
[1:36:51] I thought you said a phenomenal thing
[1:36:53] last night don't I don't particularly
[1:36:55] know why you said it but you said you
[1:36:57] can't talk and when you're married you
[1:36:59] can't talk about your Old Flames
[1:37:02] now I'm gonna I want to tell you why
[1:37:05] once you're married the marriage is a
[1:37:08] holy matrimony
[1:37:14] and to reintroduce oh lost
[1:37:18] brings a prostitute Spirit male and
[1:37:22] female
[1:37:24] back into your relationship
[1:37:28] and you're always competing with a
[1:37:32] shadow
[1:37:38] don't
[1:37:39] bring it
[1:37:45] keep your bed holy
[1:37:50] keep it holy
[1:37:52] but brother on I had all these
[1:37:53] relationships that old man's supposed to
[1:37:55] be dead
[1:37:58] now I'm doing something with that now
[1:37:59] you're married
[1:38:01] a new Administration has took place
[1:38:05] it's not your daddy's the head anymore
[1:38:07] now the husband is the head he's not to
[1:38:10] be abusive to hold that headship
[1:38:14] he's to be a leader in the home and
[1:38:17] you're his Queen
[1:38:20] and you pay him due respect you be
[1:38:22] honoring you
[1:38:25] It's A Love Affair between a man and a
[1:38:28] wife now I'm going higher than that when
[1:38:31] you come to God
[1:38:35] don't bring up old lovers
[1:38:37] [Applause]
[1:38:38] that's buried it's over with
[1:38:43] don't go back and get old music don't go
[1:38:45] back and get old things don't go back
[1:38:48] and watch those old nasty stuff don't
[1:38:51] bring it into the bedroom of your home
[1:39:00] it's a clean linen it's a pure lemonade
[1:39:06] [Applause]
[1:39:34] I would never do anything
[1:39:37] to disappoint Blondie
[1:39:46] and I mean that was on my heart
[1:39:51] I've asked God to take me home
[1:39:55] before I would disappoint
[1:39:57] him
[1:40:03] and I mean that
[1:40:05] with all my heart
[1:40:09] I Fellowship in a realm Two Worlds
[1:40:15] and I say it very reverently
[1:40:20] I'm not brother Branham
[1:40:28] but I'm thankful
[1:40:30] that I get to fellowship with angels
[1:40:35] thankful that I get to hear the voice of
[1:40:37] God
[1:40:41] I don't want to do anything
[1:40:44] to break that kind of Fellowship
[1:40:54] do you understand
[1:41:00] another thing brother Brandon said three
[1:41:02] things that would get a preacher money
[1:41:05] women
[1:41:07] and popularity
[1:41:11] let me just talk about those for a
[1:41:12] minute because they're going to get
[1:41:13] everybody
[1:41:15] money
[1:41:16] if you own the whole world and you lose
[1:41:19] your soul
[1:41:23] what profits you
[1:41:31] I was with I was the other day being
[1:41:33] taken care of by a nurse
[1:41:35] and she told me she was making a hundred
[1:41:38] and seventy two dollars an hour
[1:41:43] and I asked her was she happy
[1:41:45] and she said no
[1:41:47] I can't say I'm happy
[1:41:50] money
[1:41:52] does not bring happiness
[1:41:57] you can own the biggest farm in this
[1:41:59] community
[1:42:01] and it will not bring you happiness
[1:42:03] you can drive a Bentley some of us don't
[1:42:06] even know what that is you can drive a
[1:42:09] Bentley
[1:42:10] and crash at the next red light
[1:42:15] and somebody else can walk into your
[1:42:17] life
[1:42:18] man or female
[1:42:20] that make you feel like you're the king
[1:42:23] of the Earth
[1:42:24] but if it's adultery
[1:42:26] look where it's going to take you
[1:42:30] let me just say this stop and think
[1:42:33] about your grandkids
[1:42:36] stop and think about your children
[1:42:40] stop and think about your church
[1:42:45] man
[1:42:47] five minutes if we exaggerate it
[1:42:56] five minutes if we exaggerate it it's
[1:43:00] not worth losing eternity
[1:43:10] so the old Administration is a destroyer
[1:43:13] I've just described that to you
[1:43:16] and that's about the only way that I can
[1:43:18] put it for you and that's not just for
[1:43:20] preachers
[1:43:35] I'm sorry I'm so weak
[1:43:38] brother random said he should be the
[1:43:40] Principal
[1:43:43] if that's what we he is and we believe
[1:43:46] it don't we
[1:43:48] then if he is that
[1:43:51] then he should be the Principal theme
[1:43:54] of our talking
[1:43:56] of our thinking
[1:43:58] of our singing
[1:44:00] of our walks
[1:44:03] he should be the Principal theme
[1:44:06] of our life
[1:44:12] and if he's the principal theme of the
[1:44:15] Bible
[1:44:16] and the Bible is in US
[1:44:18] then he should be the Principal theme of
[1:44:22] everything that we do
[1:44:25] say think
[1:44:27] should be Christ
[1:44:31] I watched Andrew walk last night like
[1:44:34] Enoch walked
[1:44:37] and there came a time that he walked so
[1:44:39] close to God
[1:44:41] until God took him
[1:44:45] let me just give you a News Bulletin
[1:44:47] God's going to have a life
[1:44:53] that's going to walk so close to him
[1:44:56] until a righteous God can tell the devil
[1:45:01] you don't have a right to her
[1:45:03] [Music]
[1:45:05] she is without spot or blemish and I
[1:45:09] have a right because I bought her
[1:45:12] she can come home to me
[1:45:15] Hallelujah
[1:45:18] cleared her dead
[1:45:20] there's nothing that's held against her
[1:45:23] I find no fault
[1:45:25] [Applause]
[1:45:27] that's part one and neither can Satan
[1:45:31] [Applause]
[1:45:48] well brother Ron I'm I don't know so
[1:45:50] much about all this
[1:45:52] stick around
[1:45:56] stick around
[1:45:59] Noah's message was absolutely right
[1:46:02] and if you stuck around long enough
[1:46:05] when the water got about right there you
[1:46:08] were a believer
[1:46:14] and if you didn't think Jesus was right
[1:46:18] when the Earth was shaken and the sun
[1:46:20] refused to shine and everything was
[1:46:23] tiring apart
[1:46:25] they were screaming is this the Son of
[1:46:28] God too late
[1:46:40] Russia is doing exactly what she's
[1:46:42] supposed to do
[1:46:46] she ain't done yet
[1:46:49] as a matter of fact she's as warming her
[1:46:51] machine up
[1:46:53] North Korea is doing what she's going to
[1:46:55] do
[1:46:55] China a manned Army that no man can
[1:46:59] number not even China
[1:47:04] mother on I feel so restricted
[1:47:07] I feel we're so restricted in the walls
[1:47:10] of the message
[1:47:12] can I talk to you about walls for a
[1:47:14] couple of minutes
[1:47:17] our previous president started building
[1:47:19] a wall
[1:47:21] what a bunch of nonsense everybody
[1:47:23] started to throw fits over building a
[1:47:26] wall
[1:47:27] you know uh
[1:47:30] I'm not pro economy Republican or
[1:47:32] Democrat
[1:47:37] but there's reasons you've got to have
[1:47:39] laws
[1:47:43] my brother Ron I don't know about that I
[1:47:45] got no trespassing signs at my yard
[1:47:49] I don't want every Tom Dick and Harry
[1:47:54] putting a tent in my yard
[1:47:58] Building A Fire
[1:48:01] hunting my deer
[1:48:03] don't have none but hunting my dear
[1:48:05] I do have a few bear hunting my bear
[1:48:11] and while I'm sitting eating my dinner
[1:48:13] looking through it my listen I got a
[1:48:16] private house
[1:48:18] I don't want to keep it private
[1:48:21] so therefore I have Gates I have I have
[1:48:24] no trespassing signs I've got signs that
[1:48:27] says we shoot
[1:48:33] if you think mine's you ought to go to
[1:48:36] vijay's house
[1:48:41] tell him Jess tell him I brought him up
[1:48:44] men working
[1:48:47] railroad crossing
[1:48:50] no Railroad on that driveway
[1:48:56] explosive Danger
[1:49:00] he's probably talking about you jazz
[1:49:10] China built a wall
[1:49:12] 5500 miles long
[1:49:18] 5500 miles long
[1:49:22] it didn't preserve them from war
[1:49:26] they were trying to protect what they
[1:49:28] had
[1:49:29] somebody had a vision we're going to
[1:49:31] build a wall
[1:49:35] don't get your panties in a wad
[1:49:40] because our nation's trying to build a
[1:49:43] wall
[1:49:46] I am who I am
[1:49:48] foreign
[1:49:49] not changing for nobody
[1:49:51] only God
[1:49:54] [Applause]
[1:50:06] where did they get their inspiration
[1:50:07] from
[1:50:09] you're going to a save
[1:50:12] who has a wall all around the outside
[1:50:16] come on
[1:50:22] because you are the bride and I think
[1:50:25] there's where you're gonna live
[1:50:27] walls of Jasper streets of gold
[1:50:31] [Applause]
[1:50:33] Gates apparel
[1:50:35] we can't even explain how great those
[1:50:38] walls are going to be
[1:50:41] but all over the Earth the redeemed of
[1:50:43] the Earth
[1:50:44] people that's given
[1:50:46] eternal life because of their life is
[1:50:49] going to live all over but God's got a
[1:50:51] house for his bride
[1:50:54] sorry about Wows up
[1:50:57] [Music]
[1:51:09] one more thought
[1:51:21] in Matthew chapter 28 and verse 19.
[1:51:25] he said go you therefore and teach All
[1:51:28] Nations
[1:51:29] baptizing them in the name
[1:51:32] of the father
[1:51:34] and of the son
[1:51:35] and the Holy Ghost
[1:51:41] and maybe you don't understand this but
[1:51:43] Matthew wrote it exactly how Jesus said
[1:51:47] it
[1:51:50] now it was a wall
[1:51:55] it was a wall
[1:51:57] because so many people look in their
[1:52:00] Bible
[1:52:01] they're sincere
[1:52:02] they're very sincere
[1:52:04] and they read their Bible they bred it
[1:52:06] through over and over and over again but
[1:52:09] when it comes to Matthew chapter 28 and
[1:52:11] 19 they're walled off from the
[1:52:14] revelation
[1:52:18] and their eyes can't see past what
[1:52:21] happened that seraphent Matthew was
[1:52:25] standing there under that anointing
[1:52:27] and he walled it off and blinded their
[1:52:30] eyes that that's as far as they could
[1:52:32] see
[1:52:33] but when you came to it
[1:52:38] the Revelation Dropped In Your Heart
[1:52:41] he's talking about a name above every
[1:52:44] name
[1:52:45] a king above every King he's talking
[1:52:48] about Acts chapter 2 and verse 38
[1:52:51] because the law protected from the
[1:52:54] holies of holy
[1:52:57] and the Revelation was Jesus Christ
[1:53:01] [Music]
[1:53:04] you couldn't miss it
[1:53:07] the walls wasn't for you
[1:53:11] I I feel like shouting right now
[1:53:14] the wall didn't keep you out
[1:53:17] the wall actually put you in
[1:53:20] [Applause]
[1:53:40] one more
[1:53:46] so when it comes to the Book of
[1:53:48] Revelations
[1:53:49] it is a book of Revelation
[1:53:52] it's exactly what it says
[1:53:54] so there's walls there
[1:53:57] so for the nominal Church
[1:53:59] when they look at the horse riders
[1:54:02] they got Christ
[1:54:04] riding that horse
[1:54:07] as pale
[1:54:10] red
[1:54:11] black
[1:54:14] and even white to start out with
[1:54:17] they got Jesus writing that
[1:54:20] but when the messenger under a new
[1:54:22] Administration looked at the book
[1:54:24] [Music]
[1:54:27] it wasn't Jesus riding those horses that
[1:54:31] was the arch enemy riding those horses
[1:54:36] and what that did is it opened the book
[1:54:40] that there were twins all the way since
[1:54:42] the garden even in heaven
[1:54:46] [Applause]
[1:54:48] and in every age God raised up a seed an
[1:54:52] anointed a seed that would overcome
[1:54:55] every horse rider
[1:54:56] [Applause]
[1:54:59] same enemy riding every horse but it's
[1:55:03] the same God anointing every Overcomer
[1:55:07] of their age
[1:55:08] [Music]
[1:55:12] and what your friends can't see you
[1:55:15] can't unsee
[1:55:22] foreign
[1:55:38] so good to have you back home
[1:55:40] I watched you walk on the stage and
[1:55:44] you're sung with the choir this morning
[1:55:48] you went good places but there's no
[1:55:51] place like home
[1:55:53] there's no place like home
[1:55:56] I heard you pray this morning brother
[1:55:58] Doug and I I heard the passion in your
[1:56:01] voice
[1:56:03] welcome home
[1:56:06] [Applause]
[1:56:25] I got a picture the other day of
[1:56:27] Jonathan
[1:56:29] and Autumn's baby
[1:56:31] looking out the window
[1:56:35] and she tells me how much she loves me
[1:56:43] how did Jonathan get here
[1:56:46] a new Administration
[1:56:50] no way your parents will you know we
[1:56:52] pray they see it but you just go why
[1:56:54] can't they say it
[1:56:56] but once you saw it you can't unsee it
[1:57:01] how did you get here you can't unsee
[1:57:03] that since it's Eternal as God is
[1:57:06] eternal
[1:57:07] I hope you've had some time with Stephen
[1:57:09] and Kara
[1:57:10] I mean they their life just
[1:57:22] maybe I'm where I'm weak I'm a little
[1:57:24] temperamental
[1:57:26] Chris you're supposed to be here all the
[1:57:28] time
[1:57:31] Mary you may be so much like Ruth Ann
[1:57:36] everybody tells me they must be kin
[1:57:38] there's so much alike well
[1:57:40] maybe some of her parents had something
[1:57:42] to do with your parents out there in
[1:57:44] Arkansas
[1:57:47] but we all come from a tree
[1:57:54] Gabrielle what are you doing here you're
[1:57:55] a Pruitt
[1:57:59] what are you doing here probably going
[1:58:00] to have more Pruitts before it's all
[1:58:01] over with
[1:58:04] we got too many girls and boys here for
[1:58:07] to not be more Pruitts here
[1:58:17] it'd be wonderful
[1:58:21] some things the things you wrestle with
[1:58:23] so hard
[1:58:25] it's because you're being birthed
[1:58:29] amen you remember when you were in the
[1:58:31] womb don't you
[1:58:36] sure you do you remember when you was in
[1:58:39] a womb use in there and everything was
[1:58:42] so comfortable you could hear Mama's
[1:58:44] breathing and you could hear her
[1:58:46] heartbeat and she was feeding you
[1:58:49] sometimes some really funny stuff
[1:58:53] pickles and peanut butter and it was
[1:58:55] going right down from here it was going
[1:58:58] right through an umbilical cord and it
[1:59:00] was hooked on the inside of you and and
[1:59:02] you were growing some of you were about
[1:59:04] the size of a peanut when you were born
[1:59:06] but some of it was 11 pounds but you
[1:59:10] guys must have been eating potatoes a
[1:59:11] whole lot
[1:59:17] foreign
[1:59:22] you're getting ready to have a baby
[1:59:25] now what you're going to have to do is
[1:59:26] push
[1:59:30] and Brandon your job is not go get a
[1:59:33] Coca-Cola
[1:59:34] and a Snickers bar at the wrong time
[1:59:39] I did that
[1:59:42] that don't work
[1:59:45] I'm standing at the machine and getting
[1:59:48] myself a uh I think I finally got a
[1:59:51] Pepsi out of there and my money just
[1:59:53] kept going in and they called me across
[1:59:55] the thing and
[1:59:56] get to the delivery room immediately I
[2:00:00] sat there all night
[2:00:02] I was hungry
[2:00:07] I was a lot of good for it all I'll just
[2:00:09] tell you I was a lot of good I ran in
[2:00:12] the room they throwed me in this deal
[2:00:14] and tied it around me put gloves on I
[2:00:17] saw what was going on passed out
[2:00:21] [Applause]
[2:00:23] thank you
[2:00:26] there's no we're having a baby here
[2:00:39] but only at least two of them I was
[2:00:42] going
[2:00:45] and Connie said why don't you push
[2:00:57] listen she held my hand so tight my size
[2:00:59] nine ring became before
[2:01:02] [Applause]
[2:01:11] but she had to push
[2:01:14] those beautiful boys and little girl
[2:01:16] from that Realm
[2:01:19] they didn't want to come
[2:01:23] and she pushed and she pushed because
[2:01:27] time was ready
[2:01:28] and she pushed I'm sorry Gabrielle
[2:01:32] sorry to bring up horror
[2:01:34] and she pushed
[2:01:39] thank God for epidurals for fathers and
[2:01:41] mothers

[2:01:50] that's what you want to hear
[2:01:52] isn't that right in that right Anna
[2:01:53] that's what you want to hear
[2:01:57] now that baby
[2:01:59] yeah he looks like his daddy no I think
[2:02:01] he looks like his mama he looks like
[2:02:03] himself
[2:02:12] why would you end a sermon like this
[2:02:16] some of you when you first came in
[2:02:19] were so at home in this world
[2:02:23] you were so comfortable
[2:02:27] you so like what you was doing
[2:02:30] and you didn't realize the enemy was
[2:02:31] feeding you through the umbilical cord
[2:02:35] God had a plan
[2:02:39] he had planted a seed before you ever
[2:02:42] arrived
[2:02:44] on the inside of you
[2:02:47] and when you you came to serve the Lord
[2:02:53] stood at the altar and you held on
[2:02:56] I'm not going down there and then you
[2:02:58] find yourself here
[2:03:00] well I'll Never Shout and then you find
[2:03:03] yourself
[2:03:04] sweaty
[2:03:07] I'm not going to sit through an hour
[2:03:08] sermon you sit through a three-hour
[2:03:11] movie
[2:03:13] [Applause]
[2:03:26] but after a while you you've breathe
[2:03:29] life into this world
[2:03:31] and you said
[2:03:33] this isn't as hard as I thought it was
[2:03:34] going to be
[2:03:37] I don't even want to talk about the old
[2:03:39] man
[2:03:40] you know why you're under a new
[2:03:44] Administration
[2:03:49] [Applause]
[2:04:03] Hallelujah don't you love him
[2:04:06] isn't he good to us

[2:04:21] cover me
[2:04:24] that's what I want you may be in a storm
[2:04:27] I heard I heard Andrew last night talk
[2:04:30] about brother Brian quoting brother
[2:04:31] Branham how we need Thunderbolts
[2:04:34] well let me explain something to you
[2:04:36] whether you know this or not
[2:04:38] to have a thunderbolt preacher
[2:04:41] he's got to be in a storm
[2:04:48] how many of you go up 3 40.
[2:04:53] did y'all see the fire last night to
[2:04:55] that tree
[2:04:56] and you see here a while back that tree
[2:04:58] got hit by lightning
[2:05:00] there was no storms last night so
[2:05:03] somebody had to set that tree on fire
[2:05:06] I don't care I like fires too
[2:05:13] so you witnessed that so sometimes you
[2:05:16] watch a service and maybe not nothing's
[2:05:18] going on in your life and all of a
[2:05:19] sudden you look over at another tree
[2:05:23] and there's a fire going on
[2:05:26] you see there's a thunderbolt came and
[2:05:28] it
[2:05:29] it got her and it got him and it got her
[2:05:37] I can't imagine the odds of getting hit
[2:05:40] by lightning but I have
[2:05:43] don't want it again
[2:05:46] but let me just say this to you when it
[2:05:48] comes to God's lightning
