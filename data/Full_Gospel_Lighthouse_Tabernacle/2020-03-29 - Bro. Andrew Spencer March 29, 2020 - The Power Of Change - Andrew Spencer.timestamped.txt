[47:14] today in the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:16] Christ we thank you for assembling

[47:23] privilege to be able to address you in
[47:24] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[47:26] thank the Lord for these services that
[47:28] are made available that we could speak
[47:30] to you in this manner and may God's
[47:32] blessings be upon each and every one of

[47:36] assembled in your homes we pray his

[47:53] don't have to panic because Jesus is
[47:55] there and I'll give you another
[47:56] assurance you don't have to panic
[47:58] because I'm still here now when I'm gone
[48:00] then that's the time to panic because
[48:02] I'm leaving near one of these morning's
[48:03] between the hours of 6:00 and 9:00 so we
[48:06] just rest assured and the promises of
[48:08] God this morning I bring you greetings
[48:10] from our pastor brother Iran he sends
[48:13] his love and his greetings to you and he
[48:15] misses you just like we all do and we
[48:18] certainly miss assembling ourselves
[48:20] together but we're praying that that day
[48:22] soon comes to us sooner than what is
[48:25] expected the president has asked for 15
[48:28] days and we're definitely into that so
[48:31] we don't know exactly what will come of
[48:33] this
[48:33] but we definitely want to be praying
[48:36] that God's will be done in this we know
[48:38] that that out in Arkansas if it was not
[48:41] for this coronavirus that God had
[48:43] allowed that thousands maybe hundreds of
[48:45] thousands may have got killed in a
[48:48] tornado
[48:48] that came through that area but we know
[48:50] that God has everything in control and
[48:52] we can rest in his promises and even in
[48:55] these hours we can rest in his promises
[48:57] so we bring you greetings from him this
[49:00] morning and we're praying that that God
[49:03] would come by our way and strengthen our
[49:05] pastor and minister to him I love
[49:08] brother Matthew singing that song
[49:10] leaning on the everlasting arms this
[49:12] morning and that's where we truly are
[49:13] leaning I was just reminded this past
[49:16] week that when brother when congressman
[49:19] Upshaw as we are very familiar with his
[49:22] testimony that after he was healed been
[49:25] being 66 years an invalid laying there
[49:28] in that same condition that after he was
[49:31] healed he went and testified at Congress
[49:34] he testified to the Saints and he
[49:36] testified to Winston Churchill and he
[49:39] stood there on the White House and sung
[49:41] to Congress leaning on the everlasting
[49:43] arms sister Elena butts was was
[49:47] miraculously healed one morning when a
[49:50] service like this and in a similar
[49:52] manner and they were singing leaning on
[49:55] the everlasting arms after brother Tim
[49:57] Pruett got done preaching on extreme
[49:59] things and God came and did an extreme
[50:02] thing for sister Elena and we know that
[50:05] God is still in the business of doing
[50:07] extreme things and we are his people and
[50:09] we are strong and we will do exploits
[50:12] and we know that the same God that we're
[50:14] relying on now we can't create the same
[50:16] atmosphere for brother on to take off
[50:19] running in but we know and we're leaning
[50:21] on the same everlasting arms now one of
[50:23] these mornings he's going to take off
[50:25] running and there will be a change
[50:27] overcome his body for I believe with all
[50:30] of my heart that brother ons ministry is
[50:32] not done yet but he has many more
[50:34] conventions to preach until the rapture
[50:37] comes I'm believing with you as a body
[50:39] that we're going to take the rapture
[50:41] together and I believe it soon but I
[50:43] believe if God is a divine healer that
[50:46] God will give him divine health and so
[50:49] we just rely upon those things and we
[50:52] want to be remembering sister Nancy
[50:54] today yesterday her mother passed away
[50:57] there in Danville
[50:59] Genya and so it was about I believe
[51:02] around 9:00 or 9:30 in the morning that
[51:05] she passed and so we just want to be
[51:07] remembering sister Nancy she's the she's
[51:10] the last one of her immediate family
[51:12] that is still here on the earth and but
[51:15] we know that that God has a huge family
[51:18] that is surrounding her with with
[51:20] prayers and love and so we just want to
[51:23] be remembering her that God would
[51:25] comfort her in this hour of need
[51:27] no matter how old you are death still
[51:30] hurts
[51:31] no matter how young you are death hurt
[51:33] so we just pray that God would
[51:35] strengthen my grandmother that God would
[51:37] give her a peace that passes all
[51:39] understanding a man maybe this morning
[51:43] before we turn to the word we could sing

[58:12] and verse 6 and then also down to 2nd
[58:17] Peter chapter 1 and verse 16 trusting
[58:22] today that the Lord would speak to you
[58:23] in such a prolific way that you would
[58:27] know that it is he that is speaking to
[58:28] you this morning by the help of the Lord
[58:31] I would like to I'd like to speak to you
[58:34] on this thought on the power of change
[58:37] the power of change Malachi chapter 3
[58:41] and verse 6 where I am the Lord I change
[58:46] not what a wonderful what a wonderful
[58:51] announcement to us therefore you sons of
[58:54] Jacob are not consumed even from the
[58:57] days of your fathers ye are gone away
[59:00] from mine ordinances and have not kept
[59:03] them returned unto me and I will return
[59:05] unto you say if the Lord of hosts
[59:07] but you said wherein shall we return 2nd
[59:11] Peter chapter 1 and verse 16 for we have
[59:16] not followed cunningly devised fables
[59:21] when we made known unto you the power
[59:24] and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[59:28] were our witnesses of his majesty may
[59:32] God bless his the reading of the word
[59:34] you may be seated
[59:35] there in your your seats at home and
[59:38] pews here today we so appreciate the
[59:40] brothers and sisters that have gathered
[59:42] to make this service possible and give
[59:44] us a sense of normalcy we we've kind of
[59:48] joked about this just a little bit we
[59:51] picked out the we picked out the ten
[59:53] that needed it the most and here we are
[59:55] with the ten that needed that the most
[59:57] but the thing about that is I'm in that
[1:00:00] number so I guess I need it just as much
[1:00:02] as these brothers and sisters so we
[1:00:04] certainly appreciate them coming and
[1:00:06] making this service possible to give us
[1:00:09] a sense of Nohr
[1:00:10] we'll see and to be in my Amen Corner a
[1:00:12] man we'd like to speak to you by the
[1:00:14] help of the Lord on the power of change
[1:00:16] the power of change and we're certainly
[1:00:19] living in changing times we're certainly
[1:00:21] living in moments of things that have
[1:00:23] happened to us in the last few days in
[1:00:25] the last few weeks things are changing
[1:00:28] in the world and things are moving at
[1:00:30] such a fast pace it's amazing how fast
[1:00:32] things have changed for us in a matter
[1:00:35] of seconds in a matter of seconds our
[1:00:37] whole life has changed our this is not a
[1:00:40] this is not a persecution on religion
[1:00:42] but this is a shutdown of of governments
[1:00:45] this is a shutdown of places of business
[1:00:48] because of because of a sickness that is
[1:00:51] constantly spreading and the
[1:00:52] government's doing the very best way to
[1:00:55] stop these things and they don't know
[1:00:57] how to stop it they don't know how to
[1:00:58] change certain ways or they don't know
[1:01:00] scientists don't know how to bring in
[1:01:02] different things to make this thing stop
[1:01:04] but we serve a God that does not change
[1:01:07] we serve a God that knows exactly the
[1:01:09] remedy that will stop this and if there
[1:01:12] is time left for you and I on this earth
[1:01:14] then God will allow us to get over these
[1:01:16] things and we sense the effects of this
[1:01:19] change even here this morning we sense
[1:01:21] the effects of it and and how amazing
[1:01:23] how change happens in our life if we've
[1:01:26] just went through the loss of my grandma
[1:01:28] and it's amazing the effects of a change
[1:01:30] it's amazing the effects of a change
[1:01:32] when I when a child is born and when
[1:01:34] they they come in they change the way
[1:01:36] that you look at life and how you view
[1:01:38] life you get a whole new perspective on
[1:01:40] life change brings about a a beautiful
[1:01:44] way of perspective it allows you to look
[1:01:47] at things in a whole new manner it
[1:01:49] allows you to see things in a way you
[1:01:51] see God is the God he is a God that
[1:01:54] cannot change but he has a people that
[1:01:57] are born to be changed by the revealing
[1:02:00] of the son of man and we have watched as
[1:02:02] that word has went forth how it has
[1:02:05] transformed us how it has made us to be
[1:02:07] exactly what He has called us to be and
[1:02:10] we know that it is his word that is
[1:02:12] constantly and ministering to us in
[1:02:15] every level that is changing us we know
[1:02:17] that we could not change in our own
[1:02:19] it's his power of change that works upon
[1:02:22] us that that makes us to be it rolls
[1:02:25] away the snowball effect of seeing how
[1:02:27] how sin just comes and it makes us just
[1:02:30] go down that road and how it sin just
[1:02:33] continually builds up but God is a God
[1:02:35] that is continually taken away but he
[1:02:38] doesn't do it it isn't just for him that
[1:02:40] he takes it away this day or take it
[1:02:42] away a little at a time but God covers
[1:02:45] her sin and he completely annihilates
[1:02:47] that sin he's a God that changes your
[1:02:50] walk he changes your attitude he changes
[1:02:52] everything about you he's the God that
[1:02:54] is so powerful and so omnipotent he's a
[1:02:58] God is he's all-powerful he's
[1:03:00] all-knowing he's that kind of a god to
[1:03:02] us and we sense his effective change in
[1:03:05] these brothers and sisters that have
[1:03:07] gathered here we realize that God is the
[1:03:10] one that brought about this change they
[1:03:11] didn't gather here this morning just
[1:03:13] because of myself they gathered here
[1:03:16] because of a change happened in their
[1:03:18] lives they witnessed the Living God I'd
[1:03:21] say that those that are sitting here
[1:03:22] would be able to testify and you that
[1:03:25] are listening to this service if you
[1:03:27] have been touched by the master you can
[1:03:30] identify with the power of change when
[1:03:32] he came passed away when he walked past
[1:03:35] your road and he spoke and in a moment
[1:03:37] he changed your whole situation we know
[1:03:41] that even in life that roads changed the
[1:03:44] way we used to travel does not lead
[1:03:46] doesn't work that way no more cities
[1:03:48] changed politics has changed things are
[1:03:52] constantly changing year after year
[1:03:54] politics changed nations change year by
[1:03:57] year they're changing their ideas are
[1:03:59] changing their identity they're changing
[1:04:01] their agendas and they change their
[1:04:04] attitude one way one day they're this
[1:04:06] way in the next day they're not they
[1:04:08] don't know which mine they don't know
[1:04:09] which mine they want to take they either
[1:04:11] going to take the left or they're going
[1:04:13] to take the right but that's for me I
[1:04:15] want to have the mind of Christ where
[1:04:17] the Bible said let this mind be in you
[1:04:19] which was also in Christ Jesus our Lord
[1:04:21] I don't want to have the mind of
[1:04:23] politics that's always changing I don't
[1:04:25] want to have the mind of of the Congo
[1:04:28] in the mind of a man but I want to have
[1:04:30] the mind of a God that do will not
[1:04:32] change I want to have the mind of a God
[1:04:35] that is always the same brother Branham
[1:04:38] said in 1962 the unchangeable God
[1:04:41] working in an unexpected way
[1:04:44] he said we find now that the church has
[1:04:47] changed and people's changed roads
[1:04:50] changed the scenes change the politics
[1:04:52] changed but there's one thing that does
[1:04:55] not change and that's God he remains the
[1:04:58] same he says I am God and I changed not
[1:05:00] no matter how long it is God has never
[1:05:02] changed one bit and he cannot change
[1:05:05] what a place the reason he cannot change
[1:05:07] is because he's infinite and anything
[1:05:11] that's infinite cannot change and then
[1:05:13] let us study this just for a moment
[1:05:15] before approaching on into the
[1:05:18] Scriptures infinite is infinite there's
[1:05:21] no beginning or in he's almighty
[1:05:23] omnipotent omnipresent omniscient he
[1:05:25] knows all things are places all times
[1:05:28] are powerful he is God and he cannot
[1:05:31] change now I can make a decision and say
[1:05:34] it's going to be this way and then I'm
[1:05:36] flying eyed I'll have to change because
[1:05:38] things come up that I have to say well I
[1:05:42] was wrong but God can't do that you see
[1:05:45] because his one decision is that forever
[1:05:47] he cannot change his decisions cannot
[1:05:50] change it therefore if God's attitude
[1:05:53] towards one sinner wanted to repeat Adam
[1:05:56] and Eve and God made a way for them to
[1:05:58] repent and if we gave that sinner and
[1:06:01] the next sinner comes in God has to God
[1:06:03] God has got to do the same thing to that
[1:06:06] sinner or he did wrong when he acted
[1:06:08] with the first Center and if a man was
[1:06:11] sick and God healed one man then if he
[1:06:15] ever if ever another man comes to God
[1:06:18] he's got to do the same thing or he did
[1:06:21] wrong when He healed the first one if he
[1:06:24] comes on the same ground what a resting
[1:06:26] place then for the soul that seeking
[1:06:29] refuge I say that that's where we're
[1:06:31] resting this morning we're a people
[1:06:33] that's looking for a City of Refuge we
[1:06:36] can rest in these promises that they're
[1:06:39] not changing that God if he met a sinner
[1:06:42] he'll meet a sitter now if he met one
[1:06:44] that need healing then he'll meet her he
[1:06:46] won't need a person he'll meet that
[1:06:48] person in that spot where they need
[1:06:50] healing you see in the beginning was the
[1:06:52] word and the word was spoken was a
[1:06:54] creative word in every word that spoken
[1:06:57] cannot be taken back I love that God is
[1:07:00] not taking back his promises he's giving
[1:07:03] him out to us in his magnifying those
[1:07:05] promises he cannot you see that word
[1:07:08] that spoken cannot be taken back for a
[1:07:10] mistake you see then in the beginning
[1:07:12] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:07:14] and the Word was God and the Word was
[1:07:17] made flesh and dwelt amongst us which is
[1:07:19] Christ now notice this in paragraph 53
[1:07:23] says and now the word of God written in
[1:07:26] the Bible is his word to us now I when I
[1:07:29] read over the promises of God
[1:07:31] I consider those things to me I don't
[1:07:34] know how you read the promises of God
[1:07:36] but I consider these promises to me I
[1:07:39] read myself into that scripture that he
[1:07:42] has blessed me coming in and I put my
[1:07:44] name there that he has made me the head
[1:07:46] and not the tail
[1:07:47] and I put my name there he was speaking
[1:07:50] to the children of Israel there but Here
[1:07:52] I am in a spiritual as a spiritual
[1:07:55] Israel that these things are the
[1:07:58] promises of God and here it is written
[1:08:01] to us it is his word to us heaven and
[1:08:04] earth will pass away but this word will
[1:08:06] pass away if he promised he healed you
[1:08:09] he promised he healed you if he promised
[1:08:11] he changed you he'll change you if he
[1:08:14] promised that he would rapture you he
[1:08:16] will rapture you if he promised that he
[1:08:18] would save your prana khals he'll save
[1:08:20] your products if he promised that he
[1:08:22] would bless you coming in and bless you
[1:08:25] going out he will do that because he's
[1:08:27] God and he cannot change
[1:08:29] it's his word to us and every promise
[1:08:33] has the same power of creation behind it
[1:08:38] how beautiful that when we would look
[1:08:41] back we don't know how how many thousand
[1:08:44] years ago we look at the timing of the
[1:08:46] Bible and we know that over 6,000 years
[1:08:49] ago that
[1:08:51] God would speak those things and he
[1:08:53] would say let there be light and you
[1:08:55] would watch the material ation of that
[1:08:57] promise as it would go out
[1:08:59] God spoke it and he said let there be
[1:09:01] and it simply happened because it was
[1:09:04] God's Word and it materialized itself
[1:09:07] because it was from God and God believed
[1:09:11] his own word and the world that we live
[1:09:14] on is framed out of a word you cannot
[1:09:17] see it's a word that is circling this
[1:09:20] world it's a word that errors promises
[1:09:22] that are hanging in that word that are
[1:09:25] waiting to be dropped overtop of you if
[1:09:27] you can realize in your spot of despair
[1:09:29] this morning that there's a word that is
[1:09:32] hanging over top of you that if you
[1:09:34] could just reach out and touch the line
[1:09:36] as it were and you can reach out that
[1:09:38] those promises will drop upon you those
[1:09:41] promises can't change if God said let
[1:09:44] there be and it happened it has to be
[1:09:47] the same way with you God cannot change
[1:09:49] it is his word to us it is his love to
[1:09:52] us it's got the same power of creation
[1:09:57] behind it you watches that word as it
[1:10:00] goes across your loved one you prayed
[1:10:02] and you pray the prayer of faith over
[1:10:04] them you took the promises of God in
[1:10:07] Acts chapter 19 and you took those
[1:10:09] prayer cloths and you laid it under your
[1:10:11] loved ones bed and you watch them as
[1:10:13] they came in and fill the pew out you
[1:10:16] see that was a promise your faith was
[1:10:19] not necessarily it was not necessarily
[1:10:22] in the material of the prayer cloth but
[1:10:24] it was in getting the promise of God you
[1:10:28] see just like when Peter was walking
[1:10:30] down the road and his shadow crossed him
[1:10:33] and those that are were laying there and
[1:10:35] they were crippled and they were maimed
[1:10:36] and had all kinds of needs in their body
[1:10:38] it was not the shadow itself but it was
[1:10:41] the faith of Almighty God that was on
[1:10:44] the inside of Peter that if the same God
[1:10:46] could change Peter he can change my
[1:10:48] mortal body he can resurrect me in a
[1:10:51] form of of the flesh and he can make me
[1:10:53] whole he's that kind of a God you see
[1:10:57] it's not a need the material your
[1:10:59] promise your faith is not in the literal
[1:11:01] the
[1:11:02] pages or the material of the pages but
[1:11:05] it's in the promise that is on the pages
[1:11:08] these are promises of God that have
[1:11:11] become to pass in our life and we have
[1:11:14] watched them as God as we look and we'd
[1:11:17] see the darkness upon the face for the
[1:11:19] deep and then God said let there be
[1:11:21] light and light came and it drove the
[1:11:24] darkness away it was that thought it was
[1:11:28] that God that spoke those things and
[1:11:29] it's got the same power behind it that's
[1:11:32] God's Word he did it at the beginning if
[1:11:36] we believe it to be the Word of God it
[1:11:39] depends on where the seed falls you see
[1:11:43] if it falls into a ground if it falls
[1:11:46] into a ground that can create a moisture
[1:11:48] or a nurse when around the promise of
[1:11:52] God will bring forth every promise the
[1:11:54] Bible made Wow the right mental attitude
[1:11:58] towards any divine promise of God will
[1:12:01] bring its plows we've spoke those things
[1:12:04] for years you've heard these things
[1:12:05] that's message believers for years but
[1:12:07] it ain't change if you have the same
[1:12:10] mental attitude that you had when you
[1:12:12] got saved if you can have the same
[1:12:14] mental attitude about the promise that
[1:12:16] it will bring it to pass
[1:12:17] God's attitude ain't change so why
[1:12:20] should our attitude change towards the
[1:12:22] promises just because you get deeper in
[1:12:25] the valley should not change the way we
[1:12:27] look at God's Word you see you can't
[1:12:30] rely upon what you see you've got to
[1:12:32] rely upon what God said right mental
[1:12:36] attitude towards any divine promise of
[1:12:38] God will bring it to pass if you just
[1:12:41] look at it and take care of the word
[1:12:42] just right because the infinite God
[1:12:44] spoke it it's God's Word the Bible says
[1:12:48] in Psalms 102 and 24 I said oh my god
[1:12:52] take me not away in the midst of my days
[1:12:56] my ears are throughout all generations
[1:12:59] of all now has laid the foundations of
[1:13:04] the earth and the heavens are the work
[1:13:07] of the hands notice these things these
[1:13:09] are the works of God they shall perish
[1:13:14] but thou shall endure all of them sell
[1:13:17] alcohol laughs old like a garment as a
[1:13:20] vesture shalt change them and they shall
[1:13:23] be changed you look at this mortal body
[1:13:25] as it get older you see gray hair
[1:13:28] slipping in you see teeth starting to
[1:13:30] slip out you see glasses that you didn't
[1:13:32] used to need now you need them you're
[1:13:34] watching a changin over your body you're
[1:13:37] watching you see this earth as you watch
[1:13:40] an older person as they'll begin to
[1:13:42] stoop over you see gravity is calling
[1:13:45] them back to the ground it's calling
[1:13:47] them back you see it's a changin this
[1:13:50] body is changing when you were from the
[1:13:52] age of 0 to 21 you became strong but
[1:13:55] from that point you started to die off
[1:13:57] but one of these morning's one of these
[1:14:01] mornings they'll speak such a change
[1:14:03] come over you that it'll resurrect he
[1:14:06] won't replace but in a resurrect that
[1:14:09] body these things will change but God
[1:14:13] will not change you think about that God
[1:14:17] is a God that cannot change but he's so
[1:14:20] mould you and I to his promises that he
[1:14:23] does not break us and he does not make
[1:14:26] us weak but he wraps us around him that
[1:14:30] we become stronger in the promises of
[1:14:33] God there's trials that come there's
[1:14:36] storms that come but they don't not make
[1:14:38] us as Christians grow away from God
[1:14:41] they make us lean on his everlasting
[1:14:43] arms verse 27 but how are the same and
[1:14:50] thy years shall have no end the children
[1:14:55] of the servants shall continue and their
[1:14:58] seed shall be established before thee
[1:15:02] whoo there's not gonna be one that don't
[1:15:06] make it that he is already established
[1:15:08] if he establish you before the
[1:15:10] foundation of the world you're coming it
[1:15:12] may not look like you're coming and you
[1:15:14] may not feel like you're going to change
[1:15:16] but if your hears you will change people
[1:15:20] get stuck in their own way to get
[1:15:22] stubborn in their own ways as hell my
[1:15:24] momma did this and I
[1:15:25] gonna do it but my daddy did this or my
[1:15:27] daddy did that and I'm gonna do it you
[1:15:29] see when God looks your way there is
[1:15:32] nothing going to stop you from coming to
[1:15:35] the master you can try to hide but God's
[1:15:38] already got your hiding place already
[1:15:40] figured out well prophet said in what
[1:15:45] you think of Christ what what think of
[1:15:47] Christ when God has once said anything
[1:15:50] it will remain forever can I be altered
[1:15:52] you know I Kings word is not altered you
[1:15:55] know that like in a nation the nation
[1:15:58] that's controlled by a king it's not
[1:16:00] politics to play there the king is said
[1:16:03] so and it might be carried out must be
[1:16:05] carried out that Saturdays and when God
[1:16:08] speaks it must be carried out there's no
[1:16:10] alternative
[1:16:11] there's no playing of politics it's got
[1:16:13] to be taken out just exactly the way
[1:16:15] he's headed for if once spoken it's
[1:16:18] established forever in glory so when we
[1:16:21] read his word its eternal and will never
[1:16:25] cease to exist
[1:16:26] I believe his word with all of my heart
[1:16:29] all my soul all my life all that I am I
[1:16:32] just hang on to this word that's right I
[1:16:35] believe it forever
[1:16:37] the truth you see God has given us a
[1:16:41] world that has spoken we have received a
[1:16:44] word that has been given and now we
[1:16:46] watch the transformation of a life you
[1:16:49] see the Holy Spirit is the one that has
[1:16:51] changed you when you look at brother
[1:16:55] Donnie Nichols in his daddy prayed and
[1:16:57] his mama prayed for him all those years
[1:16:58] and he watched as it came down to a
[1:17:01] source he came down to a spot that God
[1:17:04] brought about such a prolific change
[1:17:07] that brother Donnie was no longer the
[1:17:09] same man as he was before God knows what
[1:17:12] he's doing when I look upon you and I
[1:17:15] pray for you I think about the change
[1:17:18] that has happened in your life those
[1:17:19] things are the Holy Spirit's working in
[1:17:22] your life we were just being testified
[1:17:26] this week and being brother out and
[1:17:27] we're working with a man very close to
[1:17:29] us they're near our home and he began to
[1:17:32] testify to us of a young man that goes
[1:17:34] to this church service that he used to
[1:17:36] be real tight without no
[1:17:38] world and he said one day he said we
[1:17:40] were tight one day and the next day he
[1:17:42] come back completely changed he said we
[1:17:45] use the word weird he said because he
[1:17:48] changed you see we look weird to the
[1:17:51] rest of the world we look weird to the
[1:17:54] rest of the world but gods changed comes
[1:17:56] upon us and it so changes us that we no
[1:18:00] longer think the same thing we never
[1:18:02] looked the same thing we don't act the
[1:18:04] same way that's the power of his change
[1:18:08] because he's God now the Bible says in
[1:18:12] Ezekiel 36 and 24 for I will take you
[1:18:16] from among the heathen gather you out of
[1:18:21] all the countries and I will bring you
[1:18:23] into your own land then I will sprinkle
[1:18:26] you clean water will sprinkle clean
[1:18:29] water upon you and you shall be clean
[1:18:33] from all your filthiness and from all
[1:18:35] your idols will I cleanse you a new
[1:18:38] heart also will I give you and a new
[1:18:43] spirit when I put within you and I will
[1:18:45] take away the stony heart out of your
[1:18:47] flesh and I will give you a heart of
[1:18:49] flesh you see here this next verse in 27
[1:18:54] here is the change here is the message
[1:18:57] that how I will put my spirit within you
[1:19:00] this is the age of the personal life of
[1:19:04] Jesus Christ you hear these things in
[1:19:06] crisis the mystery of God revealed that
[1:19:08] these things have come and so changed us
[1:19:12] it's his spirit on the inside of you I
[1:19:14] look upon you and I see the change of
[1:19:18] Almighty God and I look out upon it and
[1:19:20] I'm not missing the big picture here
[1:19:22] things are changing around us my lifes
[1:19:25] are changing our bodies are changing but
[1:19:28] I'm not missing the big picture God is
[1:19:31] preparing you for a body change God is
[1:19:34] preparing us as a body of Jesus Christ
[1:19:36] to be lifted up one of these days and it
[1:19:40] all began because I put my spirit within
[1:19:43] you
[1:19:44] I made a deposit and if you abide in me
[1:19:48] and my words abide in you ask what you
[1:19:51] will
[1:19:51] it's abiding it's staying there it's not
[1:19:55] leaving as it would leave the Prophet
[1:19:57] David when David was a man that was
[1:19:59] built after God's own heart he was a man
[1:20:03] that knew how to repair it was a man
[1:20:05] that knew how to worship but the
[1:20:06] prophets the Prophet would tell us that
[1:20:08] the anointing would come and the
[1:20:10] anointing will leave but Christ is not
[1:20:13] leaving you
[1:20:14] since the dispensation of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:16] has been poured out upon you his people
[1:20:19] he's abiding there he's staying there
[1:20:22] he's the one that's bringing about these
[1:20:25] mighty changes and I will put my spirit
[1:20:29] within you and cause you to walk in love
[1:20:34] that God is the one that starts to work
[1:20:37] and he begins to make all the prophecy
[1:20:40] roll into existence and I will cause you
[1:20:44] to walk in my statutes I've had young
[1:20:46] people come to me and ask me brother
[1:20:48] Andrew how will I do it how will I do it
[1:20:50] I've tried this I've tried that you see
[1:20:53] once he puts his spirit on me inside of
[1:20:55] you he will cause you to walk this way
[1:20:58] we're not walking the way of Cain or
[1:21:01] Korah we're walking the way of Almighty
[1:21:04] God we're going up the Kings Highway and
[1:21:08] I promise you I say to you and I
[1:21:10] demolish you if you're not walking why
[1:21:13] don't you start while I'm talking
[1:21:15] walking up the Kings Highway hey he's
[1:21:18] the one that will cause you to walk in
[1:21:20] his statutes and ye shall keep my
[1:21:24] judgments and do them and ye shall dwell
[1:21:29] in the land that I gave to your fathers
[1:21:33] and ye shall be my people and I will be
[1:21:36] your God what a promise that we are to
[1:21:41] dwell in the land of the Pentecostal
[1:21:43] fathers we're dwelling in the land of
[1:21:47] the message of the hour these things are
[1:21:49] to us these things are promised to us
[1:21:52] and here we are inhabiting the promises
[1:21:54] of God you see we were born to be in the
[1:21:57] image of God to bear his limits to be
[1:22:00] like him
[1:22:01] but brother random would say the power
[1:22:02] of transformation that as you look out
[1:22:05] on a cornfield you look out there and
[1:22:07] you see those old creepers how that
[1:22:09] they'll come up and those creepers will
[1:22:11] reach around that corn stalk and wanted
[1:22:14] to do a creeper will grab and it's
[1:22:17] trying to twist explain that corn stalk
[1:22:19] and bring it down
[1:22:21] he said that Satan cannot create so
[1:22:25] Satan deforms and Satan perverts and
[1:22:28] perverts means to bring about a change
[1:22:30] to change over to change over to make a
[1:22:34] change and Satan knows that he cannot
[1:22:37] create so he reaches around your life as
[1:22:40] you begin to get closer to God and walk
[1:22:42] closer to God that he begins to come in
[1:22:45] with the creeping and he starts wrapping
[1:22:49] himself surrounds you and he starts
[1:22:51] robbing you of all of the nutrients that
[1:22:54] you need to be strong in the Lord but
[1:22:57] what brother Bantam told us is that a
[1:22:59] farmer had to go out there and chop that
[1:23:02] creeper out and that's what this word
[1:23:04] does it's a short - is it sword and it
[1:23:07] cuts going and coming and this word as
[1:23:10] you have noticed on your life that it
[1:23:12] sometimes hurts your feelings sometimes
[1:23:16] it hurts the way you act or the way that
[1:23:18] you would do normally but it's chopping
[1:23:21] off the creeping of the deforming of
[1:23:23] Satan off of your eyes those things that
[1:23:26] we don't have or we don't like to preach
[1:23:28] because we know that it's going to cause
[1:23:30] a change on somebody there's some times
[1:23:33] that you don't feel like or you may not
[1:23:36] want to preach because you know you know
[1:23:39] it's gonna hurt somebody but I would
[1:23:41] rather hurt your feelings now than they
[1:23:43] hurt your feelings later there's
[1:23:45] sometimes it's not necessarily easy to
[1:23:48] preach these things but I get behind it
[1:23:50] with everything that I am I'm not
[1:23:53] bashful about preaching and I'm bold for
[1:23:56] about it because it's my job as a duty
[1:23:58] as a pastor of this church to preach to
[1:24:01] you the things of God and I will not be
[1:24:04] guilty of your blood being upon my hands
[1:24:06] I will stand on the save the Lord no
[1:24:11] what comes no matter what goes these
[1:24:13] things are true I've gave my whole life
[1:24:16] up to do it and I'm not willing to lose
[1:24:19] one of you I'm not willing for it to
[1:24:21] allow the creeping of the deformation of
[1:24:26] Satan to slip into your life and to rob
[1:24:29] you of the nutrients of your joy and
[1:24:31] your peace and your health it's my duty
[1:24:34] as a son of God
[1:24:35] to chop those things off of your life
[1:24:38] that's why we get behind this pulpit
[1:24:40] that's why we get behind this word and
[1:24:43] we say God it's not me that's gonna do
[1:24:45] the work because if I do the work then
[1:24:47] man will fall but if you do the work God
[1:24:50] if you're the one that will not change
[1:24:52] and I send that word out and that word
[1:24:54] is received it'll start cutting down the
[1:24:58] deformation of Satan and Satan loose its
[1:25:01] grip on your life but there's a power
[1:25:06] there's a power that'll keep you there's
[1:25:09] a power that will anoint you there's a
[1:25:12] power that will change you there's a
[1:25:14] power that's greater than the creeper
[1:25:17] called Satan he loves to slip his way on
[1:25:20] the inside of your life he loves to come
[1:25:23] in and slip in with maybe different
[1:25:26] things that you're dealing with and he
[1:25:28] slips in with music where he slips him
[1:25:30] with this habit or slipped him if that
[1:25:32] happen it says well he does like as they
[1:25:36] did at the beginning hath not God said
[1:25:39] and he stuck footing in one word one
[1:25:42] word at a time and before long you're
[1:25:45] believing a lot but I have good news to
[1:25:48] you children there's a power that
[1:25:50] greater than the pervert or Satan
[1:25:52] there's a power that's greater than your
[1:25:55] sin there's a power that's greater than
[1:25:57] your sickness there's a power that's
[1:25:58] greater than the creeper of sin and that
[1:26:00] is Almighty God and you're sitting here
[1:26:03] that have witnessed the power of the
[1:26:05] Holy Ghost and you're a witness to the
[1:26:07] things that God has done you have
[1:26:09] experienced and living the heart and a
[1:26:13] true experience of a true Christian is a
[1:26:16] reality but it never can be known and
[1:26:20] felt without the Spirit of God
[1:26:22] troubles comes
[1:26:23] storms of trouble and he looks at
[1:26:25] tempest in the face he says I know that
[1:26:28] all things work together for the good
[1:26:31] his children die the partner of his
[1:26:33] bosom is carried to the grief
[1:26:35] he said the Lord God gives and the Lord
[1:26:37] God takes away blessed be the name of
[1:26:39] the Lord his farm may fail his crop is
[1:26:42] blighted his business prospects are
[1:26:44] clouded you see him approaching at the
[1:26:47] last dark valley of the shadow of death
[1:26:49] and you hear that man cry yea though I
[1:26:52] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:26:54] death I will fear no evil thy rod and my
[1:26:57] staff they comfort me
[1:26:58] and thou thyself are with me I ask you
[1:27:03] what makes this man calm in the midst of
[1:27:07] all these various trials and personal
[1:27:10] troubles if it be not the Spirit of God
[1:27:14] but look at the Christian in his joyous
[1:27:16] moments he is rich God has given him all
[1:27:21] his heart's desire on earth mark that
[1:27:24] man he has plenty of room for pleasures
[1:27:26] in this world but he drinks out of a
[1:27:29] higher sister his pleasure Springs from
[1:27:33] things unseen his happiest moments are
[1:27:36] when he can shut all these good things
[1:27:39] out and when he can come to God as a
[1:27:42] poor guilty sinner and come to Christ
[1:27:44] and enter into the fellowship with him
[1:27:46] and rise into nearness of access and
[1:27:49] confidence and bowed approach to the
[1:27:52] throne of heavenly grace it is only the
[1:27:55] working of the holy spirit working on
[1:27:58] the inside of a human being that can
[1:27:59] make you act and live and pursue a life
[1:28:02] of this manner that when you even walk
[1:28:04] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:28:06] death you'll say I'll fear no evil when
[1:28:09] you're all alone you know he's there
[1:28:10] only the power the Holy Ghost can
[1:28:13] reaffirm these things I've dealt with
[1:28:15] people that are dealing with so much
[1:28:17] fear they don't know and they're dealing
[1:28:19] with so makes anxiety and I wonder it
[1:28:23] makes you reach out into your soul I say
[1:28:26] am I really born again because if you
[1:28:29] are in a mist of panic it shows you that
[1:28:32] there's something wrong on the inside
[1:28:36] you say well brother Andrew what are you
[1:28:37] gonna do if you get diagnosed with the
[1:28:39] Kuro device I'm going to do the same
[1:28:41] thing if I get diagnosed with cancer
[1:28:44] I'm going to believe his promise and I
[1:28:46] believe this promise is true no matter
[1:28:48] what comes
[1:28:49] I still believe God's promises to be
[1:28:52] true he's a God that heals only the
[1:28:58] changing power of Almighty God can make
[1:29:00] a man walk according to his word when
[1:29:03] you look at Elijah and Elijah when
[1:29:05] Elijah was out walking and looking for a
[1:29:07] successor to come after his ministry for
[1:29:10] Elijah knew that he was coming down to
[1:29:12] the closing hours of his ministry and
[1:29:15] there was Elijah out out of plowing with
[1:29:18] those with his oxen and he was out there
[1:29:21] and Elijah watched him that he was
[1:29:23] faithful in what he was doing he was
[1:29:26] faithful in keeping a plough straight in
[1:29:29] on the narrow path there was nobody else
[1:29:32] watching him but Elijah held true to
[1:29:35] what his belief was no matter if
[1:29:37] somebody was around or no matter
[1:29:39] somebody was looking he didn't know
[1:29:42] Elijah was come looking for him but he
[1:29:44] was still doing what was right and
[1:29:47] Elijah Luke told him their lives and
[1:29:50] looked on Elijah and he walked over to
[1:29:52] him and he threw his mana over on him he
[1:29:56] did not look to see to see if Elijah fit
[1:30:00] the robe he made come on somebody
[1:30:03] he made Elijah to fit the rope he didn't
[1:30:07] trim his robe down to make it fit Elijah
[1:30:10] he made Elijah to fit the robe you see
[1:30:15] the working of the Holy Ghost does not
[1:30:17] change his word to fit you he changes
[1:30:20] you to fit his word God ain't changing
[1:30:23] how it does business
[1:30:24] he ain't changing how he asks he's not
[1:30:27] changing how he does things he has
[1:30:29] working on the inside of you and he's
[1:30:31] trimming off things in your life to make
[1:30:34] you fit in line with the Word of God he
[1:30:39] alters us he does not alter his word
[1:30:43] he's a god that does not change he's a
[1:30:46] saying yesterday today and forever
[1:30:51] God didn't die God still alive he's the
[1:30:58] one that is perfecting us he's the one
[1:31:01] that is bringing about the change he's
[1:31:03] the one that's doing these things he's
[1:31:09] asked us to be perfect
[1:31:11] even as our Heavenly Father in heaven is
[1:31:14] perfect
[1:31:14] there's no way in your own righteousness
[1:31:16] brother Jeff that you can make yourself
[1:31:18] perfect but he made a way of
[1:31:20] appropriation so that you can be perfect
[1:31:23] he looked upon you in such a way that
[1:31:26] you would be able to say like brother
[1:31:27] William Bulevar preached a few weeks ago
[1:31:29] mama that's me he has sent His Word to
[1:31:33] sow cultivates her life and change her
[1:31:36] life that you can look in the mirror of
[1:31:38] God's Word and you would say Papa I see
[1:31:42] what you asked me to be I see what you
[1:31:45] want me to be and I'm fitting hallelujah
[1:31:48] it's not a pastor that did that it's
[1:31:51] Lord that came that made you fit what
[1:31:54] he's asked and required in this moment
[1:31:57] and in this change in this challenge of
[1:31:59] the hour it's God's Word that made you
[1:32:02] live this way my brand-ne home my Papa
[1:32:07] Charlie my dad didn't come and knock me
[1:32:09] on the head and make me believe these
[1:32:11] things God came and got ahold of my life
[1:32:13] God changed my life if I'm not forced to
[1:32:16] live this way I love to live this way
[1:32:20] he's the God that brought about change
[1:32:23] as the poet said where God begins his
[1:32:27] gracious work that work he will complete
[1:32:30] for around the objects of his love our
[1:32:33] power and mercy meet man may repent of
[1:32:36] his hire him hum of his work and I'll
[1:32:39] fail and fail in his attempt but God is
[1:32:43] above the power of change he never can
[1:32:45] repent
[1:32:46] each object of his love is sure to reach
[1:32:50] the heavenly goal for neither sin or
[1:32:52] Satan can destroy the blood washed soul
[1:32:57] Oh glory to God when Elijah when he
[1:33:01] walked all the way through and he walked
[1:33:03] all the way with Elijah and he told him
[1:33:05] to turn back and Elijah said I'm not
[1:33:08] gonna leave him I'm going with you all
[1:33:10] the way that's the way we as the bride
[1:33:12] of Jesus Christ we're saying you're
[1:33:14] worth following you you're our headship
[1:33:17] you have made us her body and we're
[1:33:20] following you all the way no matter what
[1:33:23] comes no matter what goes we're
[1:33:25] following you something brought about
[1:33:29] this change and Elijah Elijah said I'll
[1:33:33] follow you where you go and Elijah as he
[1:33:36] walked past the school of prophets in
[1:33:38] the school of Prophet said do you not
[1:33:40] know do you not know that the prophets
[1:33:43] gonna leave you this day but that did
[1:33:45] not change eyelashes it did not change
[1:33:48] his testimony he said I'm going all the
[1:33:51] way I love that that because just
[1:33:54] because the rest of the world has
[1:33:55] criticized us for walking this way we do
[1:33:59] not change just because the critics or
[1:34:02] the school of theologians have told us
[1:34:05] that this way is a dying way they don't
[1:34:08] realize what's on the other side of
[1:34:10] Jordan I know what's on the other side
[1:34:14] I've tasted and seeing what the Lord has
[1:34:17] done hallelujah hallelujah and elastic
[1:34:23] goes all the way and he watched his
[1:34:25] predecessor Elijah as he comes down to
[1:34:28] Jordan and he smites
[1:34:30] the Jordan River and he walks across and
[1:34:33] Alaska asked for a double portion when a
[1:34:38] large ask what will you ask that I give
[1:34:41] you and he said I ask of a double
[1:34:44] portion of your spirit he said you've
[1:34:47] asked a hard thing but if you see me
[1:34:50] when I go you shall have what you asked
[1:34:53] for
[1:34:53] Oh Church of the Living God we've seen
[1:34:56] him we've watched him we've watched him
[1:34:59] as he's gathered us on the chariots of
[1:35:02] his word and he lifted us from the to
[1:35:05] the Creed's
[1:35:05] and the dogmas of this world we've
[1:35:08] in a puff we risen above all the stigmas
[1:35:11] and the complexes of this world of
[1:35:13] Laodicea
[1:35:14] we've rose to the challenge we've seen
[1:35:17] God say what he said he would do and we
[1:35:20] watched him do it people have come too
[1:35:23] late to tell me my god stare I've
[1:35:26] watched him in action I've watched him
[1:35:28] bring babies to barren wombs I've
[1:35:31] watched him raise the dead
[1:35:32] I watched him save the Lost I watched
[1:35:35] him feel those that needed the baptism
[1:35:37] of the Holy Ghost he's the same God
[1:35:42] Roger goes across and the Chariots of
[1:35:46] Fire come down and they grab the servant
[1:35:49] of Elijah and the mantle drops back down
[1:35:52] upon Elijah's holders and Elijah is now
[1:35:56] at a showdown the rest of the school of
[1:35:59] the prophets are on the other side
[1:36:00] watching what a loss is gonna do and
[1:36:04] Elijah took the mantle he had the mantle
[1:36:07] of Elijah but where was the god of
[1:36:09] Elijah and he grabbed the mantle of
[1:36:12] Elijah and he smote the waters and said
[1:36:15] where be the god of Elijah and the god
[1:36:18] of Elijah showed up because he realized
[1:36:21] the power of the God of Elijah and he
[1:36:25] walked across on dry land what about you
[1:36:28] Church of the Living God these things
[1:36:30] were to you where be your God of Elijah
[1:36:34] will be your God he ain't change don't
[1:36:38] change your attitude towards the
[1:36:40] promised change don't change don't
[1:36:43] change the way you look at it change
[1:36:45] your mind to see what God says God ain't
[1:36:50] changed here he change his attitude he
[1:36:53] ain't change the way he thought about
[1:36:54] you I love cuz there's a lot of times
[1:36:58] that we as Christians we just don't feel
[1:37:01] like Christians but I think the good
[1:37:03] Lord that this ain't upon feelings but
[1:37:05] this is a poem at baptism of the Holy
[1:37:08] Ghost
[1:37:08] no matter whether I'm up no matter
[1:37:10] whether I'm down he's still there he's
[1:37:13] still living he's not changing
[1:37:17] hallelujah
[1:37:19] the Prophet said in confirmation and
[1:37:21] evidence when a man buys a car he must
[1:37:25] have a deed to that car and though he
[1:37:27] has not the car sitting in his garage if
[1:37:29] he has indeed it's a confirmation to him
[1:37:32] that he owns that car because he has a
[1:37:36] deed or the title and then if we bought
[1:37:40] a piece of ground though we have never
[1:37:42] seen the ground know nothing about the
[1:37:44] ground and yet we have an abstract to
[1:37:47] that deed to abstract deed to the ground
[1:37:49] it belongs to us whether we have seen it
[1:37:51] or not it still belongs to us the car
[1:37:54] belongs to us whether we have seen it or
[1:37:56] not yet we have the title given to us
[1:37:59] and we hold it in our possession in our
[1:38:02] name that the title shows us that we
[1:38:06] owned that car it's the abstract title
[1:38:09] deed that tells us that we own the
[1:38:12] property who there's a lot of things
[1:38:14] that you don't see but the deed tells
[1:38:17] you that it's your property for when the
[1:38:20] Bible says in Hebrews 6 and 13 that when
[1:38:23] God who when God made a promise to
[1:38:26] Abraham because he could swear by no
[1:38:27] greater he swear by himself saying
[1:38:30] surely blessing I will bless thee and
[1:38:33] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[1:38:36] after he had patiently endured he
[1:38:38] obtained the promise for men verily
[1:38:40] swear by the greater and oath for
[1:38:42] confirmation is to them an end of all
[1:38:46] strife that means it's up for no it's no
[1:38:49] more argument about it
[1:38:50] it's a confirmation it's an oath of
[1:38:53] confirmation 417 wherein God willing
[1:38:57] more abundantly to show under the heirs
[1:38:59] of promise the inability of his counsel
[1:39:02] he confirmed it by oath that by two
[1:39:06] immutable things in which it was
[1:39:08] impossible for God to lie that we might
[1:39:11] have a strong consolation we as the
[1:39:15] people of God can have a strong
[1:39:16] consolation we can rely upon this God he
[1:39:22] swore by himself he swore by himself
[1:39:25] when he could swear by no one else he
[1:39:27] swore by himself and in this day we look
[1:39:30] over
[1:39:31] revelations ten and five and we see him
[1:39:33] with his foot on a land at sea and we
[1:39:35] see his hand raised and it's a sworn
[1:39:38] affidavit to you hallelujah for in the
[1:39:43] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:39:46] he has sounded to us a message that will
[1:39:49] change our mortal bodies he swore by
[1:39:51] himself
[1:39:53] I'll take God's Word I'll take it all
[1:39:56] the way through sickness I take it all
[1:39:58] the way through storms I take it all the
[1:40:00] way through trials hallelujah if Abraham
[1:40:03] who believed when it looked like there
[1:40:05] was no hope he believed he believed in
[1:40:08] hope and he considered not his own body
[1:40:10] being dead he believed in the promises
[1:40:13] of God all the odds of God was sad all
[1:40:16] the odds of everybody around him were
[1:40:18] stacked up against him but that did not
[1:40:20] change God's plan you see God had been
[1:40:23] testing the patriarch because he had
[1:40:27] given him a promise this is where you
[1:40:30] find out whether you really trust is
[1:40:33] when you put to the test and brother
[1:40:35] Branham said that the test is the
[1:40:37] greatest thing that ever happened to you
[1:40:40] whew we enjoy reading those things on
[1:40:47] the back side of those things but it's
[1:40:50] the greatest thing you see the test
[1:40:53] really shows what you are you see we
[1:40:57] would have never known of the faith of
[1:40:59] Abraham and had not been tested but when
[1:41:02] it was put to the test
[1:41:04] he was then used like never before you
[1:41:08] see when God makes a promise he wants to
[1:41:10] be sure that this person is worthy of
[1:41:13] the promise before he fulfills what he
[1:41:15] said or what he promises you see every
[1:41:20] time God makes the Covenant with a man
[1:41:21] man can't keep that covenant
[1:41:24] man breaks that covenant just like when
[1:41:26] Adam broke it every time he made a
[1:41:28] covenant Israel he made it coming in
[1:41:30] with Israel and Israel broke that
[1:41:32] covenant but God was so determined to
[1:41:35] save his people that he made a covenant
[1:41:37] he was determined to save man
[1:41:40] I so he made an unconditional covenant
[1:41:43] and he swore by himself he swore by
[1:41:48] himself not half of the man to do
[1:41:51] anything to do with it he swore by
[1:41:54] himself
[1:41:55] and all of these things were
[1:41:57] accomplished in our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:42:00] and don't matter what your flesh is
[1:42:02] going through the promise still relies
[1:42:04] the same he made the promise to you as
[1:42:07] people he's the one that will bring
[1:42:10] about the change he said that he will
[1:42:12] perfect you he will perfect you he said
[1:42:15] that he would perform his word he will
[1:42:16] perform his word the deed tells us that
[1:42:19] he will do it the Bible tells us he done
[1:42:22] will do it the reason we believe this
[1:42:24] message is because the Bible said it
[1:42:26] would be here the reason why we believe
[1:42:28] in healing is because the Bible said it
[1:42:31] would be here the reason why we believe
[1:42:32] in a rapture is because the Bible tells
[1:42:35] us there be a rapture everything else is
[1:42:38] sifting ideas of man's ideas and
[1:42:41] changing but God's Word don't change if
[1:42:45] we could just change our attitude to
[1:42:49] change our attitude to match the
[1:42:51] attitude of the promise hello it's
[1:42:55] forever settled with God that he's the
[1:42:59] Lord our God that'll heal all your
[1:43:01] diseases he told us to lay hands on the
[1:43:04] sick and they shall recover
[1:43:05] he don't matter on how you feel the Word
[1:43:08] of God is superior to your feelings your
[1:43:11] feelings may never come hear me your
[1:43:15] feelings may never come but healing will
[1:43:20] our expectations are in healing it is
[1:43:24] not in feeling our expectations is in
[1:43:27] the promises of God not the promises of
[1:43:30] man doctors have told us that there are
[1:43:33] years in front of us but God has told us
[1:43:36] that there is an everlasting covenant
[1:43:38] that is in front of us our expectation
[1:43:41] is not what the doctor sees our
[1:43:43] expectation he's in what God sees we can
[1:43:47] expect to do we can expect God to do
[1:43:49] what he spoke because he's God and it's
[1:43:52] our duty to trust in God
[1:43:54] and act upon God's Word he's the one
[1:43:56] that'll change the situation you see
[1:43:59] it's always in the natural where God has
[1:44:02] asked us to trust him and it's our
[1:44:05] obedience that brings about the promises
[1:44:08] of God it's our faith in the promises of
[1:44:10] God that bring about the change
[1:44:13] you see God tells his children what to
[1:44:15] do and then he does it he performs it he
[1:44:19] said that he would bring about a change
[1:44:20] he'll bring about a change
[1:44:22] he said he bring about a work he'll
[1:44:23] bring about a work he said he bring a he
[1:44:25] would be a miracle worker he's a miracle
[1:44:28] worker he said he's a promise keeper
[1:44:30] he's a promise keeper he said he's a
[1:44:32] wave maker he's a wave maker even when
[1:44:35] you don't see him working he's working
[1:44:38] when you don't see him in your home is
[1:44:40] there when you don't see him in your
[1:44:42] body he's there when your body seems
[1:44:45] weak is still there for when you are
[1:44:47] weak then you are made strong hallelujah
[1:44:51] he's a God that you can trust in it's in
[1:44:56] the things of the natural where God
[1:44:59] brings about the supernatural and I say
[1:45:02] to you that God's got this yes you know
[1:45:07] what to trust him and to build an ark
[1:45:10] when everybody else around him was
[1:45:12] making fun of it Noah built the ark and
[1:45:15] God flooded the earth
[1:45:18] he was only-- Noah's job to build the
[1:45:22] Ark not to make it rain he told Moses to
[1:45:27] stretch out the rod and God parted the
[1:45:30] waters
[1:45:30] he told Joshua and March around the law
[1:45:33] seven times and then on the seventh day
[1:45:35] my surrounded seven times Joshua did
[1:45:39] what the angel asked him to do and God
[1:45:43] brought the walls down there are things
[1:45:46] in your life that God has required you
[1:45:49] to do but God brings about the change
[1:45:51] molasses Roos sticking the water and God
[1:45:54] made the iron swim he told name in the
[1:45:57] dip seven times naman dip seven times
[1:45:59] and God healed him of leprosy he told us
[1:46:04] in mark 16 and he's told every believer
[1:46:06] this
[1:46:07] to go in all the world and preach the
[1:46:09] gospel to every creature and he there
[1:46:12] believeth
[1:46:14] that's your depart that's all part Moses
[1:46:19] had a part Joshua had a part naman had a
[1:46:22] part this is your part he that believeth
[1:46:24] in his baptized shall be saved but he
[1:46:27] that believeth not shall be damned and
[1:46:30] these signs shall follow them that
[1:46:33] believe
[1:46:34] that's God's pork that's God's part all
[1:46:38] you got to do believe and these signs
[1:46:39] will follow them that believe in my name
[1:46:43] that's to every believer Moses believe

[1:46:49] about you that Allu you Hanna believe
[1:46:52] what what about you in my name in my
[1:46:55] name the science of all of them they
[1:46:59] shall cast out Devils they shall speak
[1:47:01] with new tongues they shall take up
[1:47:03] serpents and if they drink any deadly
[1:47:05] thing hallelujah it shall not hurt them
[1:47:09] they say lay hands on the sick and they
[1:47:11] shall they shall I'd say that in your
[1:47:16] home they shall recover they shall
[1:47:18] recover they shall recover they shall
[1:47:21] recover these are the promises of God
[1:47:24] and they changed not hallelujah it's our
[1:47:28] job to believe it's his job to bring it
[1:47:31] to pass he told us to believe in him
[1:47:34] that's what believers to he'll bring
[1:47:36] about it he'll bring it into this
[1:47:39] coronavirus they'll bring it into this
[1:47:41] cancer and they'll bring it into this
[1:47:43] world and we're gonna be found trusting
[1:47:46] in him and believing in him because he's
[1:47:48] God hallelujah now we're not out here
[1:47:57] tempting God saying God if your God
[1:48:01] miraculously heal this miraculously do
[1:48:03] this we're not out here tempting God
[1:48:06] handling a bunch of snakes either I
[1:48:09] believe when you do something stupid
[1:48:11] like that you're tempting God forgive me
[1:48:15] miss Timothy Brewer would say you know
[1:48:18] why they do that
[1:48:20] cuz it's stupid but we're not out here
[1:48:22] tempting God saying God if you're going
[1:48:24] to do this you'll do it in me and if
[1:48:26] it's me if it ain't if you don't do it
[1:48:28] it's because my faith is weak I
[1:48:29] absolutely do not believe that but I
[1:48:32] believe that if God lays it upon my
[1:48:34] heart to lay hands upon the one that God
[1:48:37] will do the work that he said to that if
[1:48:40] I am walking through the woods and a
[1:48:42] rattlesnake spit bites me
[1:48:44] just like happy with brother branham and
[1:48:45] brother banks woods when they were out
[1:48:47] there in the bush and that granel snake
[1:48:49] bit him are you with me and that thing
[1:48:52] transpired he was not doing that to
[1:48:55] tempt God he was doing that by a
[1:48:57] commandment of God's word that if any
[1:49:00] deadly thing hurt him they should take
[1:49:02] up serpents and it will not harm them
[1:49:06] that's a God that you serve I believe
[1:49:09] with all of my heart that if you get
[1:49:12] sick that you will get healed if you
[1:49:15] take his promise the doctor asks you to
[1:49:17] take your blood pressure medicine and
[1:49:19] you take it because you trust what the
[1:49:21] doctor said if you can trust the doctor
[1:49:24] to say what he said to what about the
[1:49:26] promises of God I can tell you the
[1:49:31] doctor can tell you to take your
[1:49:32] vitamins but you got to be the one to
[1:49:34] swallow them babies I can tell you all
[1:49:37] the promises of God I can tell you that
[1:49:39] they're true I can tell you they gotta
[1:49:41] back it up but if you don't swallow it
[1:49:43] down and let it go to war on the inside
[1:49:45] of your belly eat the whole book if you
[1:49:48] don't do it he won't bring about a
[1:49:50] change but watch as you begin to swallow
[1:49:53] the message of the hour how it changes
[1:49:56] the way you look at the world it's God
[1:50:02] that brings about the supernatural James
[1:50:05] says verse 5 chapter 5 and 14 is any
[1:50:08] sick among you let him call for the
[1:50:11] elders of the church and let him pray
[1:50:12] over him anointing him with oil in the
[1:50:14] name of the Lord
[1:50:15] notice this is your part and the prayer
[1:50:20] of faith shall save the sick now this is
[1:50:24] God's part and the Lord shall raise him
[1:50:27] up hallelujah
[1:50:30] you see there is power in yourself to
[1:50:34] bring about a change if you believe God
[1:50:37] God will do his part and if he committed
[1:50:40] any sins they shall be forgiven him
[1:50:42] blind eye dumb tongue cold heart I
[1:50:45] believe that God is able to change him
[1:50:47] all God's attitudes towards the promise
[1:50:52] is that by His stripes we are healed
[1:50:56] and our attitude towards him is that God
[1:51:00] you suffered for us so that we don't
[1:51:03] have to suffer the Bible tells us in
[1:51:05] Hebrews 12 and 29 that our God is a
[1:51:08] consuming fire and the Bible tells us in
[1:51:11] Isaiah 33 and 14 the sinners in Zion are
[1:51:14] free that seems like a lot of the chaos
[1:51:16] of the world right now the sinners in
[1:51:19] Zion are afraid fearfulness has
[1:51:21] surprised the hypocrites who among us
[1:51:24] shall dwell with the devouring fire who
[1:51:27] among us said well of the everlasting
[1:51:29] burnings he that walketh righteously and
[1:51:32] speaketh uprightly he that despises the
[1:51:34] gain of oppressions that speaketh in his
[1:51:37] hands from the holding of bronze and
[1:51:39] that stoppeth his ears from hearing a
[1:51:41] blood and shutteth his eyes from seeing
[1:51:43] evil he shall dwell on high his place of
[1:51:48] defence shall be the munitions of rocks
[1:51:51] bread shall be given him his water shall
[1:51:55] be sure when everything else is changing
[1:51:58] you are here in the munitions of rocks
[1:52:01] you are in a Fortress of the revelation
[1:52:04] of Almighty God your fortified behind
[1:52:07] that word behind the revelation of the
[1:52:09] Word of God where Christ built his
[1:52:12] church not upon himself not upon Peter
[1:52:15] but upon the revelation of God's Word he
[1:52:19] built his church and your head behind
[1:52:22] that your head behind that fortress and
[1:52:25] there can't be nothing break through
[1:52:27] that there can't be nothing break
[1:52:30] through that revelation for jesus said
[1:52:32] that heaven and earth will pass away but
[1:52:35] this word will pass away and the gates
[1:52:37] of Hell shall not prevail against this
[1:52:40] revelation
[1:52:41] if we're potatoes of the divine nature
[1:52:44] were partakers of the divine power of
[1:52:46] Almighty God
[1:52:47] who shall be able to dwell amongst the
[1:52:52] devouring fire first Peter 1 and 15 but
[1:52:57] as he which hath called you is holy so
[1:53:04] behold in all manner of conversation
[1:53:07] because it is written be holy for I am
[1:53:11] holy and if you call him the father who
[1:53:14] without respect a person judges
[1:53:17] according to every man's work past the
[1:53:19] time of your sojourning here in fear for
[1:53:23] as much as you know that ye were not
[1:53:26] redeemed with corruptible things as
[1:53:28] silver and gold from your vain
[1:53:30] conversation received by tradition from
[1:53:34] your father's but with the precious
[1:53:38] blood of Christ as of a lamb without
[1:53:41] blemish and without spot those that are
[1:53:46] the people those are the people that
[1:53:51] this fire it will drive out sin but that
[1:53:56] fire comes on the inside of you and will
[1:53:58] not hurt you it's a devouring flower
[1:54:03] here to drive out unbelief
[1:54:05] it'll drive out stigmas it'll drive out
[1:54:08] fear but the fire of God will not hurt
[1:54:11] you it'll consume all your sin but it
[1:54:14] will not consume your life but it'll
[1:54:17] make you long it is Christ that it's the
[1:54:21] one that bore your sins that boy your
[1:54:24] diseases that bore your faults that bore
[1:54:27] all your infirmities so you can start
[1:54:30] claiming all the blessings of God and
[1:54:32] you can start confessing by faith that
[1:54:35] God is a God of his word and to confess
[1:54:39] is to say the same thing there may be
[1:54:42] times when you don't feel like what the
[1:54:44] promise is but you confess what the
[1:54:47] Bible said you confess what the promise
[1:54:49] said Jesus Christ suffered for you Jesus
[1:54:53] Christ took upon himself
[1:54:55] all the consequences of your sin he to
[1:54:58] become Lord of our he will be the Lord
[1:55:03] that brings the promise to pass he will
[1:55:06] not be your work to bring sit the pass
[1:55:08] it's God that does it it will not be the
[1:55:14] doctors medicine that heals brother on
[1:55:16] he will be glad that did it for God is a
[1:55:20] healer no doctor is a healer God's a
[1:55:23] healer a doctor can aid and doctor can
[1:55:27] send but God's a healer and we take God
[1:55:31] at His Word Tom would fail me to tell of
[1:55:35] all the miracles that I've seen with my
[1:55:37] eyes that I've seen miraculously things
[1:55:42] happen in front of my eyes but the
[1:55:46] greatest is a transformation of a life I
[1:55:51] got very dear friends that are sitting
[1:55:54] in this building that are setting in
[1:55:57] streaming in their homes assembling
[1:56:00] themselves but to watch that
[1:56:05] transformation is the greatest that I
[1:56:09] could ever have Justin see to see young
[1:56:16] people my brother had a man sister Julia
[1:56:19] we so completely changed to see a lady
[1:56:23] like sister Karli be so completely
[1:56:25] changed to watch one of my bosom friends
[1:56:28] brother Jeffrey Thomas be so completely
[1:56:30] changed to watch the changing of God
[1:56:35] come we spoke on that angel working in
[1:56:39] the water it was a time to step in it
[1:56:42] was the angel that brought about the
[1:56:44] change it was not the water it was not a
[1:56:50] man that brought about the change in
[1:56:52] these young people's lives it was God's
[1:56:54] Word
[1:56:56] it's been worth it all to watch the
[1:56:59] change in every one of your lives you
[1:57:02] can call your name there because I'll
[1:57:06] forget but God won't forget
[1:57:10] he watched you change
[1:57:13] he watched you become the person that
[1:57:15] you are but to watch that transformation
[1:57:21] what would he we would hear a prophet
[1:57:24] come and when he preached on God's power
[1:57:27] to transform and the transforming power
[1:57:30] of God we've witnessed that as a church
[1:57:34] Tom would fail me to tell you the
[1:57:36] miracles that I've seen the visible the
[1:57:38] visible things but it's been God's power
[1:57:41] behind it all that brought about the
[1:57:44] change it's been God's Word that brought
[1:57:47] about the change there's been times when
[1:57:49] we've stood here at this pulpit we've
[1:57:52] seen the angel of the Lord spend right
[1:57:54] there we've seen the pillar fire slip
[1:57:57] over somebody that was sitting right
[1:57:59] there and we watched God bring about a
[1:58:02] change in their life that you as a human
[1:58:05] being were watching waiting just waiting
[1:58:08] for the change and all you knew to do
[1:58:11] was keep praying keep believing but when
[1:58:14] he came when he came he brought about
[1:58:18] the change unless just like sister
[1:58:21] sister Esther sister Elena Bunce with
[1:58:24] brother Ron Spencer with all the
[1:58:26] promises of God that we've testified
[1:58:29] about the promises were still true just
[1:58:33] like was sister Karen Pruett the
[1:58:35] promises were still true it didn't
[1:58:37] change the promise but when the angel
[1:58:40] came he brought about the change and I
[1:58:45] say to you that there's a healing angel
[1:58:48] in the land that's going about he was
[1:58:51] going by the way of Georgia Carter one
[1:58:53] time and had brought a little girl that
[1:58:55] had been in that condition for so many
[1:58:58] years and when the angel said go by the
[1:59:01] way of the chorus and then he brought
[1:59:04] about the change I'd say that that same
[1:59:06] angel is passing by the way of the brown
[1:59:09] of
[1:59:09] Jesus Christ hands are being healed
[1:59:12] cancers are being set free babies are
[1:59:16] coming miracles are coming because he
[1:59:19] said that he would do these things we're
[1:59:22] not hanging on a man's word were hanging
[1:59:24] on God's Word God said he would do it
[1:59:27] you might call us stupid so we'll just
[1:59:30] say it like you
[1:59:31] we're just stupid enough to believe it
[1:59:33] we believe that God will do the
[1:59:36] supernatural as I try to bring this to a
[1:59:44] close this morning the Bible says in
[1:59:49] Luke chapter 10 verse 18 and he said
[1:59:54] unto them and I beheld Satan as
[1:59:58] lightning falling from heaven
[2:00:01] verse 19 behold I give unto you power to
[2:00:05] tread on serpents we literally did that
[2:00:08] not even a year ago brother Jeffrey but
[2:00:12] I give unto you power to tread on
[2:00:13] serpents and scorpions over all the
[2:00:17] power of the enemy and nothing shall by
[2:00:20] any means hurt you notwithstanding in
[2:00:23] this rejoice not that the spirits are
[2:00:25] subject unto you but rather rejoice
[2:00:28] because her names are written in heaven
[2:00:31] we don't rejoice because we that the
[2:00:35] demon powers are under subjection to the
[2:00:40] power of God that is residing on the
[2:00:42] inside of us but we rejoice for her
[2:00:46] names are written in heaven we've got a
[2:00:49] right to rejoice we've got a right to
[2:00:52] praise but Jesus said that I saw Satan
[2:00:57] falling from heaven the Prophet said he
[2:01:01] said and I beheld Satan falling from
[2:01:03] heaven like lightning
[2:01:04] he said see the power of God the power
[2:01:07] of the church moving forward had just
[2:01:10] upset the whole kingdom of Satan you see
[2:01:13] he saw him as he dropped from his place
[2:01:16] because God had again given power to his
[2:01:19] church to go to
[2:01:21] he beheld him falling like lightning
[2:01:23] from heaven he was cast plumb out of the
[2:01:26] holy places and everything by the power
[2:01:28] of the church with them having power
[2:01:31] jesus said I give you power over unclean
[2:01:34] spirits and then they really upset the
[2:01:37] kingdom of de Satan what could we do
[2:01:40] with it today oh praise the Lord
[2:01:43] you see the indwelling of the Holy Ghost
[2:01:45] hath not yet came but the powers of
[2:01:49] Satan were under the feet of the
[2:01:52] disciples but what could we do of it
[2:01:54] today brothers and sisters Satan is
[2:01:58] upset because of the power that has
[2:02:01] brought about a change in your life and
[2:02:03] it's that power that will cast Satan out
[2:02:06] brother Balaam said that we are waiting
[2:02:08] for a time when the manifestations of
[2:02:10] sons will come and we will take the
[2:02:12] power of Satan away from him we'll throw
[2:02:15] it away and we'll do what we want with
[2:02:17] it
[2:02:18] I say Satan we bind her in the name of
[2:02:21] Jesus Christ let Ron Spencer loose in
[2:02:23] the name of Jesus Christ Satan take your
[2:02:26] hands off the God's property these deeds
[2:02:29] the deed has told us that these things
[2:02:31] belong to us and we believe them Satan
[2:02:34] take your hands off the Church of the
[2:02:37] Living God take your hands off of them
[2:02:41] he's the one that brings about the
[2:02:43] change Church he's the one that does the
[2:02:46] work he's the one that brought about the
[2:02:48] moments of change as the musicians come

[2:02:54] that he's circling right now I believe
[2:02:56] he's circling his camp right now I
[2:02:59] believe he's going to your loved ones
[2:03:01] right now I believe that if you've got
[2:03:03] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you send
[2:03:05] that token out across your loved ones

[2:04:01] a change
[2:04:02] Jesus trusted the Word of God when he
[2:04:04] went on mount temptation and Satan was

[2:04:43] through the ears he trusted him through

[2:14:50] a little girl there's a god that don't
[2:14:52] change there's a god that don't change
[2:14:56] little kids see the little details of
[2:14:58] life but we can point them they see
[2:15:02] things in a different way but they
[2:15:05] realize that there's a living amongst us
[2:15:07] they're sensitive to the move of God
[2:15:09] let's point them to a God that does not
[2:15:11] change and will always be there he will
[2:15:16] be with them who at all as we sing a
[2:15:19] song this morning we would dismiss may
[2:15:23] God's blessings rest upon each and every
[2:15:24] one of you as you go in the name of the
[2:15:27] Lord
