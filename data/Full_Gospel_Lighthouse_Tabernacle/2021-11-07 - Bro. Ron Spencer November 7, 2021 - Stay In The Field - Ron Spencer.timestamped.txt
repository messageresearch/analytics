[59:21] brother harold their office called me
[59:24] four days in a row
[59:26] and wanted me to come to the emergency
[59:28] room and and i did go to the emergency
[59:30] room because my doctor asked me to go dr
[59:33] gohan called me
[59:34] she didn't simply said we came too far
[59:37] to quit now and so
[59:40] she said i want you to go so i went and
[59:42] i sat there for six hours
[59:44] and uh they did a couple tests on me and
[59:48] had an iv in me and told me my tests
[59:50] were good but it may be ten more hours
[59:52] before i'd see the doctor
[59:54] well i was sitting there with people
[59:56] coughing and all other kind of things
[59:59] happened and i said connie i'm going
[1:00:01] home
[1:00:03] and so
[1:00:05] i consulted with my other doctor over
[1:00:07] here he told me it was a good idea
[1:00:16] i didn't tell them your name
[1:00:23] and
[1:00:28] he was wanting me to stay so
[1:00:31] but we came home and i felt safer in my
[1:00:34] own bed than over there and so
[1:00:36] and every day since they have been
[1:00:37] asking me to go back
[1:00:40] and yesterday seemed to be a very
[1:00:42] difficult day and
[1:00:43] and just to be honest with you the the
[1:00:45] deal that we're looking at is we have a
[1:00:47] clot that's about three quarters an inch
[1:00:49] and it's it's it's in my lung and it's
[1:00:51] right on the aorta uh
[1:00:54] there with the heart and uh
[1:00:58] three different doctors told me this
[1:00:59] week that i'm playing russian roulette
[1:01:02] and so i woke up this morning i didn't
[1:01:04] have any pain in my chest
[1:01:15] hallelujah
[1:01:19] amen
[1:01:21] brother tim wrote me something this
[1:01:23] morning and so i i asked him if i could
[1:01:26] share it
[1:01:28] and
[1:01:30] this was for me and so maybe it's for
[1:01:32] you as well
[1:01:34] cancer
[1:01:35] will end
[1:01:37] like this
[1:01:38] only belief
[1:01:40] all things are possible
[1:01:43] today
[1:01:44] is the day of the lord
[1:01:46] on a day like this joseph woke up a
[1:01:49] prisoner
[1:01:50] ready to execute his daily routine
[1:01:54] but by evening
[1:01:55] he became the prime minister
[1:01:59] on a day like this naaman woke up
[1:02:02] usually
[1:02:03] with leprosy
[1:02:04] but before the day closed he was healed
[1:02:08] and transformed
[1:02:11] on a day like this david
[1:02:14] was innocently in a field tending his
[1:02:17] father's sheep
[1:02:19] before he was sent for
[1:02:21] and was anointed to be the king
[1:02:26] on a day like this
[1:02:27] mordecai slept at a palace gate as usual
[1:02:31] as a gateman
[1:02:32] but before the day closed
[1:02:35] he brought inside was brought inside the
[1:02:38] palace and was honored
[1:02:41] on a day like this
[1:02:43] bartimaeus woke up as usual a blind man
[1:02:46] but before the day closed he was able to
[1:02:49] regain his sight
[1:02:52] [Applause]
[1:03:03] on a day like this daniel slept in a
[1:03:05] lion's den
[1:03:07] but by the time
[1:03:08] it was morning he was brought out and
[1:03:10] promoted to the pros uh prime minister
[1:03:16] a day like this a woman from
[1:03:18] shem
[1:03:20] woke up and overwhelmed by debts and
[1:03:22] threats by the close of the day
[1:03:25] she had them all paid and she became
[1:03:29] rich
[1:03:30] on a day like this lazarus slept
[1:03:33] overnight in the grave but by evening
[1:03:37] he was arisen and came back to life
[1:03:42] on a day like this the woman with a
[1:03:44] issue of blood woke up and
[1:03:46] with her illness but at the close of the
[1:03:49] day she was totally healed of it
[1:03:54] on a day like this jabez
[1:03:56] cried unto the lord and his coast
[1:04:00] was enlarged
[1:04:02] on a day like this elisha prophesied
[1:04:06] that by this time tomorrow famine will
[1:04:09] be over and there will be plenty of food
[1:04:12] and it came to pass
[1:04:14] as he had said
[1:04:17] so we believe that today is our day
[1:04:25] hallelujah
[1:04:27] for pleasant surprises
[1:04:29] and outstanding testimonies
[1:04:33] because god is greater than cancer
[1:04:37] hallelujah
[1:04:38] [Applause]

[1:05:41] ruth chapter 1 and verse 14
[1:05:45] let's just pray lord jesus we come now

[1:05:50] is to take your word and read it great
[1:05:52] men of god

[1:05:57] unction by the holy spirit

[1:06:02] unction will sweep across this audience
[1:06:06] just now
[1:06:07] and may we realize we are she
[1:06:10] the bride of the last day
[1:06:12] standing in our place
[1:06:15] rising up in this hour
[1:06:17] father we ask you to forgive us of our
[1:06:19] sins and our mistakes and failures in
[1:06:21] our humanity
[1:06:23] help us to grow in grace and the
[1:06:25] knowledge of jesus christ may the
[1:06:27] anointing of god fall on this preacher
[1:06:30] today fall on this audience and people
[1:06:32] wherever they will hear these words we
[1:06:35] pray that you would minister to us now

[1:06:43] name we pray amen and amen and amen
[1:06:47] ruth chapter 1 and verse 14
[1:06:50] and they lifted up their voice and and
[1:06:52] wept again and orpha kissed her
[1:06:54] mother-in-law
[1:06:56] but ruth clave to her
[1:06:59] and he said and she said behold thy
[1:07:02] sister is gone back
[1:07:04] unto her people and under her gods
[1:07:07] return thou after thy sister-in-law and
[1:07:10] ruth said entreat me not to leave or to

[1:07:40] if i ought but death
[1:07:43] part

[1:07:46] and she was
[1:07:48] that she was steadfastly minded to go
[1:07:52] with her
[1:07:53] when she left speaking unto her
[1:07:57] powerful scriptures
[1:07:59] ruth 2 and verse 5
[1:08:03] then said boaz under the servant
[1:08:05] that was set over the reapers
[1:08:09] whose damsel
[1:08:11] is this
[1:08:13] and the servant set
[1:08:15] over the reapers answered and said it is
[1:08:18] the moabitess damsel
[1:08:20] that came back with naomi out of the
[1:08:24] country of moab
[1:08:26] and she said i pray you let me glean
[1:08:30] and gather after the reapers among the
[1:08:32] sheeps
[1:08:34] so she came and hath continued even from

[1:08:40] that she tarried
[1:08:42] a little
[1:08:43] in the house
[1:08:44] and then boaz said unto ruth
[1:08:47] here's thou not my daughter
[1:08:50] go not gleaned to glean in another field
[1:08:56] neither go from hence
[1:08:58] but abide here
[1:09:00] fast
[1:09:01] by my maidens
[1:09:04] let thine eyes be on the field
[1:09:07] and they that do reap
[1:09:09] and go thou after them
[1:09:12] have i not charged the young men that
[1:09:15] they shall not touch thee
[1:09:18] and when thou art to thirst go unto the
[1:09:20] vessels
[1:09:22] and drink
[1:09:23] of that which the young men
[1:09:25] have drawn
[1:09:27] god bless you
[1:09:29] enjoy this
[1:09:33] have you come to have church
[1:09:38] these words kept coming to me about
[1:09:40] three weeks ago
[1:09:42] stay in the field
[1:09:46] stay in the field
[1:09:49] stay in the field
[1:09:53] they mean incredible amount to the bride
[1:09:55] of jesus christ
[1:09:57] there's a lot of characters that are in
[1:09:59] the field
[1:10:01] that are working
[1:10:02] that no doubt went to a lot of fields
[1:10:06] it was the plan of the day it was the
[1:10:07] way that they made their their living
[1:10:10] that's the way that they actually
[1:10:12] survived
[1:10:13] its people would go behind the reapers
[1:10:15] and and get the remnants that were not
[1:10:18] picked up
[1:10:20] but this girl was ordained by god
[1:10:24] now
[1:10:25] she might not understand the borders or
[1:10:28] even the boundaries of the field
[1:10:30] she might not understand even the
[1:10:33] traditions or the way that god had
[1:10:35] planned
[1:10:37] no way could she understand redemption
[1:10:40] but she was actually playing our part
[1:10:45] this girl had
[1:10:46] had had met the family
[1:10:49] of her husband
[1:10:51] she had married into them realizing they
[1:10:54] were not from moab
[1:10:56] but they were from another land and they
[1:10:58] had went they had came there because
[1:11:00] there was a famine
[1:11:02] brother branham said that's where we get
[1:11:04] in trouble is when we move out where
[1:11:07] god's blessed us
[1:11:09] but god
[1:11:10] override all of their
[1:11:13] all of their mistakes
[1:11:16] and sometimes he uses our mistakes
[1:11:22] he uses our failures
[1:11:25] to prove the very plan of god that he's
[1:11:28] got in his mind
[1:11:30] now remember god hasn't changed from the
[1:11:32] eternities as he watches time unfold
[1:11:36] many characters will come throughout the
[1:11:38] scriptures and step to their role and
[1:11:41] they're very unwittingly don't know of
[1:11:44] what they're playing
[1:11:46] joseph would be in a dungeon
[1:11:49] for years not understanding that he was
[1:11:53] playing the perfect type of jesus christ
[1:11:59] jonah would step off of a ship
[1:12:03] thinking his wife his life was not
[1:12:06] worthy of anything and it better that he
[1:12:10] die than live without god
[1:12:13] but god had prepared a great fish
[1:12:20] are you with me it's not for me to
[1:12:22] understand how that he the how he
[1:12:25] breathed under those conditions but god
[1:12:28] prepares a great fish
[1:12:30] and listen if god prepares a great fish
[1:12:35] you may have a lot of questions in there
[1:12:37] but god knows how to prepare a fish
[1:12:41] better than boeing aircraft knows how to
[1:12:43] prepare an airplane
[1:12:49] hallelujah
[1:12:50] it will get where it's going
[1:12:53] and
[1:12:54] jonah had time in that fish to pray
[1:12:58] and kept turning his way until he got
[1:13:00] himself turned a certain direction to
[1:13:02] where he knew god could hear from him
[1:13:09] this woman could not understand
[1:13:12] that where she's going back to
[1:13:14] is a land of promise
[1:13:17] it's the land of abraham's land
[1:13:20] abraham look for a city whose builder
[1:13:22] and maker is god
[1:13:24] and let me just say he entertained a lot
[1:13:26] of kings the scripture bears out in
[1:13:28] genesis 14 that he entertained kings but
[1:13:32] there was one king that came to his
[1:13:34] house
[1:13:36] and this king was not from a country
[1:13:40] that would be on the seven continents of
[1:13:42] the united of the world
[1:13:44] but it would be from heaven without
[1:13:47] father without mother and god would step
[1:13:51] like he stepped with the three hebrew
[1:13:53] children would step into a body and go
[1:13:56] be in a furnace but god stepped in at
[1:13:58] the athany party
[1:14:02] and came and ate ate lamb and drank milk
[1:14:07] and while he was there he told him of
[1:14:09] the promise that they had been talking
[1:14:11] about now for years
[1:14:13] if you remember god asked abraham to
[1:14:16] sojourn
[1:14:19] come out
[1:14:21] and he didn't know where he was going
[1:14:23] but he was being led by
[1:14:26] shall we say a deep calling to a deep
[1:14:30] and something was leading him and he
[1:14:33] couldn't explain where he was going but
[1:14:36] one day
[1:14:37] god came to his tent
[1:14:40] let me just say if you are on a journey
[1:14:43] and you don't know where you're going
[1:14:45] the greatest visitor you can ever have
[1:14:48] is for god himself to come to your place
[1:14:55] maybe before
[1:14:56] abraham couldn't
[1:14:58] couldn't describe what his life was all
[1:15:00] about
[1:15:02] having all these visitors
[1:15:05] couldn't understand
[1:15:07] he had became rich he had 318 male
[1:15:10] servants
[1:15:12] so he was doing pretty good that's quite
[1:15:13] us
[1:15:14] quite an incredible company to be quite
[1:15:16] honest with you
[1:15:18] we read about lot walking away
[1:15:21] we read about how that things happen and
[1:15:24] hurt takes place
[1:15:26] but when lot walks away melchizedek
[1:15:29] comes i'd say that's an incredible trade
[1:15:35] so when friends walk away don't worry
[1:15:38] there's more of jesus for you
[1:15:45] i think i said this last week but
[1:15:48] god ask isaac
[1:15:50] thy only son
[1:15:54] take him up and offer him as a sacrifice
[1:15:58] god settles the argument
[1:16:01] abraham had another son but it was by
[1:16:04] hagar
[1:16:06] god never recognized that
[1:16:09] blessed him but never recognized him as
[1:16:11] being abraham's
[1:16:13] seed
[1:16:15] but i want you to understand the world
[1:16:17] is in chaos in the middle east because
[1:16:19] there's still a disturbance
[1:16:22] over which one is truly abraham's seed
[1:16:27] that the fight that goes all the way
[1:16:30] back
[1:16:31] i'm not going to get into it but the
[1:16:33] fight that goes always goes all the way
[1:16:35] back was settled by god take thy son
[1:16:39] thine only son
[1:16:43] but due to jealousy and humanity the
[1:16:46] other son always thought he was apart
[1:16:49] are you with me now
[1:16:51] sometimes we ask why did god touch me
[1:16:53] and didn't touch this one or didn't
[1:16:55] touch that one remember before esau and
[1:16:58] jacob was ever born
[1:17:01] god spoke to the mother and told him
[1:17:03] that jacob i love and esau
[1:17:08] are you with me tonight
[1:17:09] listen it's all into the hands of god
[1:17:12] the predestinated hands of god and if
[1:17:15] god has ever spoke to you to draw on you
[1:17:18] don't you neglect that thirst
[1:17:24] don't you take it for granted
[1:17:30] when he brings isaac down off of the
[1:17:32] mountain of life
[1:17:34] and they have an incredible testimony
[1:17:37] we don't know the exact days or the the
[1:17:39] time but
[1:17:41] sarah would pass away
[1:17:44] now
[1:17:46] i'd like to just just drive this down
[1:17:48] one more time i don't know if i did a
[1:17:49] good enough job last week
[1:17:52] but god wanted
[1:17:54] an abstract title deed to that property
[1:17:59] so that those israelites could sit over
[1:18:01] there
[1:18:02] at their great halls of government and
[1:18:04] said
[1:18:05] god gave it to us
[1:18:10] he gave it to us
[1:18:12] and it didn't come cheap and i want to
[1:18:14] just remind you
[1:18:16] your salvation did not come cheap
[1:18:21] it didn't come through a school it
[1:18:24] didn't come through some theology it
[1:18:26] came by the blood of god himself
[1:18:30] he left the ivory palaces of heaven and
[1:18:33] took on humanity to be spit on to be
[1:18:36] mocked to be cursed
[1:18:41] and the final betrayal that his own
[1:18:44] people would choose barabbas over top of
[1:18:46] him
[1:18:47] and the government would beat him like
[1:18:50] no other man would ever be beat
[1:18:53] so that we could be healed
[1:18:57] so that we could tell cancer and look at
[1:18:59] it right in the eye and tell him
[1:19:01] you're not just defeated today you were
[1:19:04] defeated 2 000 years ago
[1:19:07] by the blood of jesus christ
[1:19:17] i wasn't just saved a few years ago
[1:19:20] i was saved
[1:19:23] when the blood was dripping from his
[1:19:26] immortal veins
[1:19:28] dripping down on the ground and
[1:19:30] purchasing this land purchasing my
[1:19:33] redemption
[1:19:36] like adam eve was pulled out of adam
[1:19:39] like the bride of jesus christ we were
[1:19:42] pulled out of the blood the rib of jesus
[1:19:46] christ himself
[1:19:49] give the lord a great big hand right
[1:19:51] there
[1:19:51] [Applause]
[1:20:00] sarah chose sarah past
[1:20:03] and abraham
[1:20:04] chose to bury her
[1:20:07] in a particular piece of property not
[1:20:09] going to go long into it
[1:20:11] but it is even recognized today as the
[1:20:14] highest piece of property that's ever
[1:20:16] been sold
[1:20:18] between two people
[1:20:23] abraham was a great man in the land
[1:20:26] and he was looking for a city who's
[1:20:28] building maker's god
[1:20:31] god had told him wherever you look look
[1:20:33] north look south
[1:20:35] east look west it's yours
[1:20:38] but he didn't own it
[1:20:41] he had a faith
[1:20:42] but he didn't own it you understand what
[1:20:44] i'm saying
[1:20:47] i like to go to biltmore but i don't own
[1:20:49] it
[1:20:52] but actually biltmore wouldn't make my
[1:20:54] dog a good house in heaven
[1:21:02] he was choosing to bury his wife in a
[1:21:06] particular land
[1:21:09] and he went to the elders
[1:21:11] and asked them
[1:21:12] i'd like to bury my wife and i'd like to
[1:21:15] buy it
[1:21:16] those elders told him
[1:21:20] bury your wife
[1:21:22] we don't want to
[1:21:24] we don't want to sell it to you
[1:21:26] bury your wife you're welcome to bury
[1:21:29] your wife
[1:21:30] there at the property
[1:21:32] but i want to own it
[1:21:38] but i want to own it
[1:21:41] and they pleaded with him bury your wife
[1:21:45] it'd be amazing that satan wants to give
[1:21:47] you religion
[1:21:52] and make you phenomenal offers
[1:21:56] but god wanted it purchased
[1:21:59] [Applause]
[1:22:02] and in the purchasing of it
[1:22:05] satan asked for a phenomenal cost
[1:22:11] he asked for a phenomenal cost
[1:22:15] in this cost
[1:22:18] it would be the highest piece of
[1:22:19] property ever transacted
[1:22:25] but abraham had a deed
[1:22:29] when netanyahu sat the other day here
[1:22:31] some months ago
[1:22:33] and said the argument is over the land
[1:22:36] he raised his bible
[1:22:42] and said this is the deed
[1:22:45] and it took them all the way back to the
[1:22:47] property that sarah was buried in
[1:22:53] are you with me this has significance i
[1:22:55] got to lay it here
[1:22:57] listen when joseph and them went into a
[1:22:59] strange land
[1:23:01] he said don't you bury me down here
[1:23:05] don't you bury me in this denomination
[1:23:10] are you with me when you go home
[1:23:13] carry my bones
[1:23:15] [Applause]
[1:23:17] you take my bones over there
[1:23:20] because there's a resurrection that's
[1:23:22] coming
[1:23:23] we got a king that's coming and he'll
[1:23:25] conquer death hell in the grave
[1:23:31] don't you bury my bones anywhere
[1:23:35] you take me back to where our homeland
[1:23:37] is
[1:23:48] this is where god told abraham i'll be
[1:23:50] your shield in your buckler
[1:23:55] he told him who he was
[1:23:57] he confirmed himself
[1:23:59] and not just confirmed himself he turned
[1:24:01] him back young again
[1:24:05] i want to just ask you right now
[1:24:08] i have spoke with many a theologian
[1:24:11] and asked him what was the great miracle
[1:24:13] that took place with melchizedek and
[1:24:16] them going to grill
[1:24:19] repeatedly
[1:24:21] through the years i've had them tell me
[1:24:23] that uh
[1:24:24] that a king that is a young king
[1:24:27] would lust after an old woman
[1:24:31] because the land
[1:24:33] was not given to them
[1:24:40] the book wasn't open to them
[1:24:44] and if the book is not open you can't
[1:24:46] see the mystery of it
[1:24:52] and let me just say even to 62 brother
[1:24:55] branham explains to us i've been probing
[1:24:57] at it
[1:25:00] i'll take his good probing over top of a
[1:25:02] lot of denominal ideas
[1:25:04] but after 63
[1:25:08] when the seals are revealed there's no
[1:25:10] longer probing at it
[1:25:12] the book the title deed
[1:25:16] became open
[1:25:19] and the kinsmen redeemer the redemption
[1:25:22] plan was open
[1:25:25] now there's a lot of people that work in
[1:25:27] this field
[1:25:31] there's a lot of people that work in the
[1:25:33] field
[1:25:34] but they work in a lot of other fields
[1:25:36] as well
[1:25:38] but the land this is the promised land
[1:25:46] it ought to be a hundred percent here
[1:26:07] satan you back off
[1:26:12] i woke up feeling good now
[1:26:14] i need him to back off
[1:26:22] can i just maybe i just
[1:26:24] until this settles down maybe i just
[1:26:26] talked to you for a minute that be okay
[1:26:29] sometimes we have some pretty good talks
[1:26:30] here
[1:26:33] don't you think about it
[1:26:35] the bible is two books it's old and it's
[1:26:38] new
[1:26:40] and here's a woman that has a past
[1:26:44] but she don't know she's a part of the
[1:26:46] plan
[1:26:48] okay
[1:26:52] oh let's go get good help me lord help
[1:26:55] me lord
[1:26:58] so here she is she's been married she's
[1:27:00] a widower
[1:27:02] her womb has been used
[1:27:04] she has no children
[1:27:07] she's not a virgin
[1:27:10] she's been married before
[1:27:12] so basically
[1:27:14] according to law
[1:27:16] her life is over
[1:27:19] cannot preach to you
[1:27:21] but actually it hadn't started
[1:27:28] her life seemed over
[1:27:30] but it hadn't started
[1:27:37] maybe she couldn't explain
[1:27:39] when orpha kisses her mother-in-law and
[1:27:42] says goodbye and goes back to her gods
[1:27:46] why she didn't go back
[1:27:49] but she responds your people be my
[1:27:52] people your god my god where you die i'm
[1:27:54] gonna die where you live i'm going to
[1:27:56] live
[1:27:58] and it was just it was such a response
[1:28:00] until it actually took
[1:28:03] naomi's breath and said well come
[1:28:06] go with me
[1:28:09] now remember this isn't her country
[1:28:12] that she's walking to she don't know
[1:28:14] where she's going
[1:28:16] she don't know the traditions
[1:28:19] she don't have no friends there
[1:28:22] she is of a little bit of a different
[1:28:23] color
[1:28:26] she has a past
[1:28:30] but she don't know it she's got a future
[1:28:37] they go back to the house where they
[1:28:38] came from they go back to the well they
[1:28:40] go back to all of these things
[1:28:42] and
[1:28:43] and they've they've got to live
[1:28:46] and naomi knows that
[1:28:49] we have kinsmen
[1:28:54] and she can see the two trees
[1:28:58] which one she would send her to
[1:29:02] and so she sends her
[1:29:04] to the kinsmen that owns the field
[1:29:10] go there and work
[1:29:13] now listen
[1:29:15] she's an alien
[1:29:23] humanity is humanity
[1:29:28] and everybody becomes judgmental
[1:29:32] everybody wants to throw a stone
[1:29:36] she's a cursed woman
[1:29:38] she has a moabitess
[1:29:40] working in our field
[1:29:44] but she was more predestinated to be in
[1:29:47] that field than all of them
[1:29:51] so when they make fun of you just give
[1:29:53] yourself a little dance
[1:29:58] this field is about me
[1:30:11] [Applause]
[1:30:15] historians bear out how beautiful she
[1:30:18] was
[1:30:19] so there was a lot of young men looking
[1:30:21] you know what i'm saying look
[1:30:24] new girl looking
[1:30:28] somehow they forget the curse when
[1:30:29] they're looking
[1:30:37] boaz is going to be a type of christ
[1:30:40] now let me just show you how neat god
[1:30:43] does business
[1:30:45] now think about it this is the promised
[1:30:47] land
[1:30:49] that the children of abraham and
[1:30:51] jacob's boys
[1:30:53] they're going to go back joseph has
[1:30:55] preserved them now god sends him a
[1:30:57] prophet of
[1:30:58] moses and moses stands there with thus
[1:31:01] saith the lord
[1:31:03] and it turns off egypt and turns on
[1:31:07] israel
[1:31:09] their eyes are quickened they're ready
[1:31:11] to go
[1:31:12] they begin to move out into a land
[1:31:15] now let me just say there's enemy in
[1:31:17] that land
[1:31:18] first major city that they're going to
[1:31:20] come to to have to fight is the best
[1:31:23] wall city in the whole land
[1:31:27] they ran chariot races across it
[1:31:32] god is not going to preserve the king
[1:31:37] he is not going to presume the council
[1:31:40] or the
[1:31:42] generals there is a harlot
[1:31:47] that has received a lot of different
[1:31:49] kind of seeds
[1:31:52] but she
[1:31:54] in his plan
[1:31:57] realizes that that's the real god
[1:32:01] that is with the children of israel
[1:32:04] he's a real god and there's something of
[1:32:07] the deep that is responding on the
[1:32:09] inside of
[1:32:10] her that's the real god
[1:32:14] two spies come
[1:32:16] and everybody else is
[1:32:19] hey i'm preaching again
[1:32:20] talking to you a little bit here
[1:32:24] so
[1:32:28] so
[1:32:29] so what happens is what happens is
[1:32:34] i'll tell dr ghana whispered
[1:32:38] so what happens is
[1:32:40] is of all of those people that wouldn't
[1:32:42] receive those spies she did
[1:32:46] and these guys come in and they begin to
[1:32:48] talk about the message and the
[1:32:50] supernatural message
[1:32:52] and they begin to tell her that this is
[1:32:54] the first city that we're actually going
[1:32:56] to destroy
[1:32:58] and it's going to come down the walls
[1:33:00] are going to come down well how can i
[1:33:04] i'm protecting you how can you protect
[1:33:07] me
[1:33:10] i believe you're god and she begins to
[1:33:12] testify to them i believe your god
[1:33:16] and they tell her to take a red scarlet
[1:33:20] thread a rope maybe to run down over the
[1:33:23] wall of her city out of her window
[1:33:25] it's a token sign
[1:33:28] god's gonna make a covenant with this
[1:33:30] harlot
[1:33:32] because god don't see her as a harlot
[1:33:36] god's not looking at her as a harlot
[1:33:39] he's looking at the end product
[1:33:41] of what i'm going to do for you
[1:33:44] god don't see your failures he don't see
[1:33:47] your mistakes he don't see your quirky
[1:33:50] little ways he sees the end product
[1:33:54] [Applause]
[1:34:14] strange thing happens
[1:34:16] that wall was incredibly ins
[1:34:19] constructed
[1:34:23] races could be run on it
[1:34:25] wars could be fought
[1:34:27] cannons could be shot
[1:34:29] fires could come
[1:34:34] and all of those walls
[1:34:37] were getting ready to come down
[1:34:39] but her peace
[1:34:45] as a matter of fact god would so curse
[1:34:48] he would so curse this city
[1:34:51] till he would curse
[1:34:53] anybody from ever
[1:34:56] building there again
[1:35:08] but when those walls fell
[1:35:12] rahab
[1:35:14] who everybody would recognize as a
[1:35:16] harlot
[1:35:20] with her family
[1:35:22] and everybody that would stay in the
[1:35:25] field or stay in the house
[1:35:30] are you getting a picture here now
[1:35:33] you see when the flood came
[1:35:36] it was only
[1:35:38] in the ark
[1:35:44] are you getting it now it's only in
[1:35:46] christ
[1:35:48] it's where you're truly safe
[1:35:52] you can build bomb shelters that won't
[1:35:54] preserve you you can turn all your money
[1:35:56] into gold that won't keep you
[1:35:59] but if you get into christ
[1:36:04] get into this word get into this message
[1:36:07] there's resurrection in it there's body
[1:36:10] changing in it
[1:36:24] i find this interesting and maybe you've
[1:36:26] never made this link
[1:36:28] but i found this interesting
[1:36:31] that when rahab becomes a
[1:36:34] a citizen
[1:36:35] identified with those israelites
[1:36:40] that god knows how to draw people
[1:36:42] together
[1:36:43] you step out of eternity into time
[1:36:46] and you're drawn together
[1:36:50] and she's drawn
[1:36:53] to the head man
[1:36:57] the captain
[1:36:59] the general
[1:37:01] salmon
[1:37:06] and she marries someone
[1:37:11] so her past is over with
[1:37:14] and she has a future
[1:37:17] when the walls
[1:37:19] didn't fall for her
[1:37:22] she had a future
[1:37:24] life wasn't over
[1:37:27] but she would be a heart at no more
[1:37:31] she could take the shingle down off of
[1:37:32] the door
[1:37:35] i'm not in business no more
[1:37:39] your god's going to be my god
[1:37:41] your people's going to be my people
[1:37:45] and she just started walking now she
[1:37:47] couldn't choose the general she couldn't
[1:37:50] choose the mighty captain she couldn't
[1:37:52] choose the mighty leader he chose her
[1:37:57] you didn't choose god god chose you
[1:38:01] [Applause]
[1:38:10] now god's got a purpose in it
[1:38:13] he's got a purpose he don't just bring
[1:38:14] you to church set you in the pew say
[1:38:17] well i'm done with him
[1:38:19] no he's got plans
[1:38:22] maybe he tells you
[1:38:24] if you trust me
[1:38:26] i'll use you like never before
[1:38:31] so that tells me i got a future
[1:38:34] i'm not looking for a hole in the ground
[1:38:36] i'm looking for a hole in the sky
[1:38:39] [Applause]
[1:38:48] so
[1:38:51] they establish a place called
[1:38:54] bethlehem
[1:39:01] it's a piece of land
[1:39:04] it's a tidal deed
[1:39:07] and they start raising barney
[1:39:11] because this is going to be the city
[1:39:13] it's got the best water
[1:39:16] and it raises the breasts wheat
[1:39:18] and barley
[1:39:20] and this is going to be the bread basket
[1:39:24] of the promised land
[1:39:28] i dare tell you now
[1:39:30] nobody called her
[1:39:32] a harlot
[1:39:35] after she became queen
[1:39:44] sure your human memory will remember the
[1:39:46] things that you used to do
[1:39:50] but don't dare nobody call you your past
[1:39:54] cause you know who you are
[1:39:56] once you're the queen of heaven
[1:40:00] and it ain't no going back
[1:40:04] no going back
[1:40:26] now sure you have an accuser
[1:40:30] should you have an accuser that point
[1:40:32] shouldn't i mean he's got a memory here
[1:40:35] everybody don't have on amnesia you've
[1:40:37] got memory
[1:40:39] you remember it's getting time for
[1:40:41] dinner
[1:40:47] there's some people probably in the
[1:40:48] building here don't remember what they
[1:40:49] had for breakfast yesterday but they can
[1:40:52] remember when they were a child
[1:40:55] they could quote those things all day
[1:40:57] long but they don't know your name they
[1:40:58] don't know your neighbor they don't know
[1:41:00] what's going on it's cause they just got
[1:41:02] old
[1:41:05] but satan will take you and take your
[1:41:07] memory and flash things before your eyes
[1:41:10] are what you used to be
[1:41:12] but you're not that guy no more
[1:41:15] looks like the same house but the guy
[1:41:17] that used to live here he died and jesus
[1:41:20] moved in
[1:41:23] and he changed our nature he didn't
[1:41:25] rehab us
[1:41:27] he created a new man on the inside all
[1:41:31] things are passed away and because all
[1:41:34] things have become new
[1:41:36] [Applause]
[1:41:46] hallelujah
[1:41:52] now i don't i don't know if you know how
[1:41:54] this works and maybe you went to school
[1:41:56] and you learned mathematics but
[1:41:58] one plus one
[1:42:02] sometimes equals three
[1:42:06] it's probably what's going to happen
[1:42:08] for the couple that stood
[1:42:10] under a tree
[1:42:25] so god ordains seed because they're part
[1:42:28] of the predestinated plan of god
[1:42:31] so
[1:42:32] out of
[1:42:34] this strange set couple
[1:42:38] that has to know what grace is about i
[1:42:41] want you to understand
[1:42:43] sometime for us to preach about
[1:42:44] prodigals
[1:42:46] you've got to have the spirit of the
[1:42:47] father
[1:42:51] to say welcome home
[1:42:57] welcome home
[1:42:58] you've got to have the spirit of
[1:43:00] forgiveness
[1:43:02] to forget hog bends
[1:43:05] and riot is living
[1:43:07] you got to be able to look at them and
[1:43:09] say welcome home you're welcome at my
[1:43:12] table you don't have to sit in the
[1:43:13] service cord you are my son welcome home
[1:43:18] so god has to when he's molding like a
[1:43:22] like a bell he puts certain chemicals in
[1:43:24] it to where that it will sound a certain
[1:43:27] way
[1:43:31] oh come on now
[1:43:32] so he has to put certain people together
[1:43:36] so that he can show his grace
[1:43:40] so he puts some on and
[1:43:42] and rehab together so they can produce a
[1:43:46] bow ass
[1:43:49] hallelujah
[1:43:51] hallelujah
[1:43:54] of all the women of israel
[1:43:56] i hope i'm okay to put it that way
[1:43:59] of all the women of israel they never
[1:44:01] attract these eye
[1:44:04] but here comes a girl with a past
[1:44:11] a history
[1:44:21] and he can't put it together
[1:44:24] he can't put it together
[1:44:27] who is this damsel
[1:44:35] she's a moabitess
[1:44:39] she's from naomi's
[1:44:40] family
[1:44:46] her being a widow didn't scare him off
[1:44:50] her being a moabitus didn't scare him
[1:44:53] off
[1:44:56] and he knew her field
[1:44:59] could preserve her
[1:45:04] she came to the right field
[1:45:10] now she don't understand redemption
[1:45:12] no way to put it all together
[1:45:15] but this was the most important man
[1:45:16] she'd ever met in her life
[1:45:23] and he goes to her
[1:45:24] not she comes to him
[1:45:26] he goes to her
[1:45:28] and he begins to talk to her
[1:45:33] let me just say this to you
[1:45:35] i can adventure
[1:45:38] by authority
[1:45:42] he never told nobody else these words
[1:45:46] stay in the field
[1:45:52] stay in the field
[1:45:54] because immediately
[1:45:56] he had plans
[1:46:03] a lot of people working
[1:46:05] but he came to you
[1:46:08] and let me just say this him coming to
[1:46:10] you is different than anybody else
[1:46:14] every one of you have a different
[1:46:15] experience with god
[1:46:18] and you can explain it and you get
[1:46:20] feelings and the other person goes
[1:46:21] that's really nice
[1:46:23] but they can't feel it but when they
[1:46:24] tell their experience tears are running
[1:46:26] down out of their eyes let me just say
[1:46:28] when you meet jesus
[1:46:30] [Music]
[1:46:32] there's just nobody like him
[1:46:36] [Applause]
[1:46:39] and he gives her instructions
[1:46:42] by the scriptures first conversation
[1:46:47] i've instructed
[1:46:48] all the young men
[1:46:51] stay away from
[1:46:55] don't you touch her
[1:46:59] you know they knew he had plans
[1:47:02] and he's the boss
[1:47:08] throw down handfuls
[1:47:10] on purpose
[1:47:15] for her
[1:47:17] because she needs it
[1:47:19] i've given her instructions you stay
[1:47:22] right here don't you go to another field
[1:47:25] let me just say this to you a lot of
[1:47:26] times in our human nature
[1:47:29] we get so
[1:47:30] ants
[1:47:31] in our pants
[1:47:38] and we want to move here move our move
[1:47:40] our
[1:47:41] we're just not satisfied
[1:47:45] come on i know i'm preaching to human
[1:47:46] beings here for a little while
[1:47:48] we get discontent with life and we're
[1:47:51] constantly looking ahead missing what's
[1:47:54] going on now
[1:48:02] sometimes people get like brother homer
[1:48:04] did at the grand canyon grand
[1:48:07] canyon
[1:48:08] remember that thomas
[1:48:11] we had traveled
[1:48:14] the best i tried to remember this
[1:48:15] morning we had traveled about six hours
[1:48:18] to get to the edge of the grand canyon
[1:48:22] we walked up we looked down
[1:48:24] we walked around a little bit brother
[1:48:26] homer said y'all ready to go seen
[1:48:28] everything you want to see
[1:48:38] what were we going to do
[1:48:40] we was looking at one of the seventh
[1:48:42] wonders of the entire world
[1:48:45] this is the place when god was making
[1:48:48] this earth he allowed the water to run
[1:48:51] through and show every element of the
[1:48:53] earth
[1:48:56] there's not two walls on the canyon a
[1:48:58] lock
[1:49:02] and he'd seen it all in five minutes
[1:49:10] remember that you remember
[1:49:12] thomas hadn't talk to us there's nobody
[1:49:14] like can talk to a daddy like a son
[1:49:18] and thomas had to have a conference with
[1:49:19] brother homer he said we came a long way
[1:49:21] daddy
[1:49:25] people come with their entire vacation
[1:49:27] just to be here we've came a long way we
[1:49:29] need to stay here for a little while we
[1:49:30] need to look around
[1:49:39] it's about the way some people do in
[1:49:41] church
[1:49:50] hallelujah

[1:50:47] wedding yesterday i thought they'd have
[1:50:49] somebody else brother ron again

[1:50:55] week

[1:51:02] she was working in the field she kept
[1:51:04] going back to every day to the same
[1:51:06] field
[1:51:09] she didn't understand that
[1:51:12] god hid and rescind in simplicity was
[1:51:14] being handed back to her
[1:51:16] but she did it
[1:51:18] the mighty god unveiled and she did it
[1:51:21] the comforter and she'd get it
[1:51:25] and she kept coming in with great big
[1:51:27] baskets
[1:51:30] while the other ladies were

[1:53:08] you can just be content just a little
[1:53:09] bit
[1:53:11] because there's something goes with this
[1:53:13] if you can be just content just a little
[1:53:14] bit
[1:53:15] you'll own the field
[1:53:24] if you make content just a little while

[1:53:47] going through and you're picking up the
[1:53:48] fragments and you're getting a bigger
[1:53:49] basket and everybody else is good
[1:53:52] i know there's times there's lean i know

[1:54:00] just keep working
[1:54:02] don't go to another field
[1:54:04] no matter how entertaining it looks like
[1:54:11] why brother ron
[1:54:13] they can't redeem you
[1:54:18] they're not willing to redeem you
[1:54:21] they're not willing to do the work for
[1:54:22] you
[1:54:24] but boaz because he's born
[1:54:29] of rahab
[1:54:32] he's been built
[1:54:35] to be your redeemer
[1:54:44] i'm going to finish with this
[1:54:46] and then i'll pick this up next week is
[1:54:47] that all right
[1:54:48] is that all right everybody enjoying
[1:54:50] this okay
[1:54:54] when jesus left the portals of glory
[1:54:58] to become a kinsmen redeemer
[1:55:04] he didn't come as a king
[1:55:07] he didn't come as a governor
[1:55:11] he didn't come as the owner of it all
[1:55:14] he was born to a teenage girl
[1:55:18] that everybody would be made fun of
[1:55:21] because she was
[1:55:23] now with child
[1:55:24] and rumors would go on that it was by a
[1:55:27] roman soldier
[1:55:29] and an old man
[1:55:31] who she's espoused to will become her
[1:55:33] protector
[1:55:37] so jesus would be born
[1:55:40] with a horrible name
[1:55:42] on him
[1:55:43] because illegitimate
[1:55:46] in that in that day was looked at of all
[1:55:50] the
[1:55:50] 400 years of not being able to enter the
[1:55:54] temple
[1:55:55] so he was born under a bad name
[1:55:59] because he had to get you
[1:56:07] he could not be born
[1:56:10] under a pristine
[1:56:12] reputation
[1:56:14] because he had to get you
[1:56:20] because here's where i'm going
[1:56:22] i know why
[1:56:23] boaz chose her
[1:56:26] because his mama was a harlot
[1:56:30] are you getting it now
[1:56:33] hallelujah
[1:56:34] but they don't realize she's
[1:56:36] representing the queen of heaven
[1:56:44] god became so low
[1:56:48] and then god could raise him
[1:56:51] so high
[1:56:54] and there's been days to where you felt
[1:56:55] so low
[1:57:00] ain't that right brother donny
[1:57:02] there's been days you felt so low
[1:57:05] because we had a history
[1:57:08] we had a history
[1:57:10] but when you walked into this place
[1:57:13] to work in this field
[1:57:16] god had plans
