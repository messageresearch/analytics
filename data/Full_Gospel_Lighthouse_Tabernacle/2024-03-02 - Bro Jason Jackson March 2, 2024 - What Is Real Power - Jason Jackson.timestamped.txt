[14:40] testimony I'm just kidding we've asked
[14:42] her to give a little bit of a testimony
[14:44] for the appointments that Dad had this
[14:46] week
[14:52] amen yeah
[14:57] absolutely
[15:00] gotta have my best
[15:02] man my best
[15:04] friend um as all of you know um on
[15:09] January the 10th um Ron had a a a normal
[15:15] a scheduled appointment with the
[15:18] oncologist um team at
[15:21] UVA and during that um process normally
[15:26] you know I have went in with him but
[15:28] those rooms are so small and so that day
[15:32] I had some we had some errands he
[15:34] saidwell why don't you just go do the
[15:36] errands and then you just come back and
[15:39] meet me here in the parking lot so
[15:42] that's what we plan to do
[15:44] well um I'm on my way back and I get a
[15:47] call and he says Connie I need you to
[15:51] come
[15:51] in and so we go into the office and um
[15:57] it was a couple hours
[15:59] waiting and
[16:01] um they the doctor had seen two
[16:05] mass in his eyes on both eyes at the
[16:10] exact
[16:12] location and so then she called in
[16:16] another doctor for a second
[16:18] opinion and so he's saying that of all
[16:23] his years of practice he had never
[16:26] saw that a person would have two masks
[16:31] at the exact location in both eyes and
[16:35] you know I'm
[16:36] thinking it's nothing you know they've
[16:39] read something wrong you know in my mind
[16:42] how can a person have two mass at the
[16:45] exact same location and so she came back
[16:48] and she says well she says it's
[16:52] maatic and as you know Ron has stage
[16:55] four
[16:56] melanoma and it had went from his lungs
[17:00] to his
[17:01] brain and so you know she said we'll be
[17:06] um getting back in touch with you so
[17:08] during that time on around I think
[17:11] January the 18th brother Tim and brother
[17:15] Donnie um came and you all were that
[17:19] were here witnessed you know what
[17:21] happened and um the service was very
[17:26] both Services was uh very moving for us
[17:29] and we just kept claiming and believing
[17:32] you know and but the enemy would climb
[17:35] up on my shoulder and tell me well you
[17:39] know
[17:40] these stairs these seizures that he's
[17:43] having well that's probably what it is
[17:46] you know and I rebuke him and I've
[17:50] always kind of felt a little um
[17:54] comfort and I know people may judge me
[17:57] for this but I would go and visit my
[17:59] daddy's
[18:01] grave so during that
[18:04] week my heart was just so
[18:07] heavy so I went up to my daddy's grave
[18:11] side and I just
[18:14] prayed and I told the Lord I said Lord
[18:18] you've been so faithful to us through
[18:20] this whole
[18:21] journey and I asked you just be with us
[18:25] help us if it is we'll give a test ony
[18:29] of your
[18:30] healing so on the 14th of
[18:33] February uh we had to go he had lots of
[18:37] scans from his brain to his abdomen uh
[18:42] pelvis and those scans came back they
[18:46] they look
[18:47] great and so
[18:49] then this um you know they were stable
[18:53] yeah there there's still the cancer is
[18:56] still there it hasn't spread sprad to no
[18:59] other
[19:00] organs and
[19:02] so then on the 18th when brother Tim
[19:06] arrived um Ron gets the
[19:10] call uh right when brother Tim has
[19:12] arrived and um that he they want him to
[19:17] come see this
[19:19] specialist and we found out this week
[19:22] he's the only specialist in the state of
[19:24] Virginia that does this um scam
[19:29] and so we we went there this Tuesday the
[19:35] 27th and while we were there we're
[19:38] sitting in the room and uh it's a big
[19:42] room and the nurses doing all kinds of
[19:47] test on him scans getting him prepared
[19:50] to see the
[19:51] doctor and so she starts talking and she
[19:55] says well she could see the Mass you
[19:59] know and so then Ron asked her you know
[20:03] he's inquisitive and so he asked her he
[20:05] said well what do they do for someone
[20:10] that's got eye cancer and to back up
[20:13] this week we had so many appointments
[20:16] and so the day before we'd been at UVA
[20:19] and there was a lady getting on the
[20:21] elevator and she had a patch on and Ron
[20:24] being the gentleman he is he speaks to
[20:26] her and talks to and and uh so she
[20:30] proceeds to tell him that she had eye
[20:32] cancer and they had to remove one of her
[20:34] eyes well you know the enemy he's right
[20:37] there on my
[20:38] shoulder so uh then the next day we go
[20:42] for this appointment and and so he asks
[20:46] this nurse he said what will they do you
[20:48] know if it is and she said well she said
[20:52] they will most likely remove one eye to
[20:57] keep control of maybe the other eye not
[21:00] getting it and or they will take one to
[21:06] save one and then they'll do uh gamma
[21:10] knife radiation again and then um uh we
[21:14] had even asked Dr gone about this and
[21:17] she said well she said let's not panic
[21:20] she said there's all kinds of treatment
[21:23] and she said when we get to that spot
[21:27] she said you are going to the best
[21:30] oncologist opthalmologist in the state
[21:33] of
[21:34] Virginia and she said we will wait to
[21:37] see what he tells us so Ron goes back
[21:40] into another room they're doing all
[21:43] these test and and um so then they put
[21:48] us in the room and he comes in and and
[21:51] uh he's looking at everything on the
[21:54] scans and he
[21:56] says you're
[21:59] stable and I'm like oh thank you Jesus
[22:02] you know I just kept praising him and so
[22:06] and he's telling us everything that he
[22:08] had saw and
[22:10] so we said is there is it melanoma and
[22:15] he says no there's no melanoma in there
[22:18] he said there are two
[22:21] lesions so you know he's going through
[22:24] everything he said but I do want to see
[22:26] you in six months and and he said we'll
[22:29] we'll watch those
[22:31] lesions and I saidwell what did they
[22:33] come
[22:34] from and so he said well you know he
[22:38] said uh it could came from mackler
[22:41] degeneration the diabetes and so he goes
[22:45] on out and his assistant is standing
[22:48] there and she's writing notes and so I
[22:51] said to her and Ron said to her well why
[22:54] did Dr valir say he had cancer in both
[22:58] eyes and then she called in this other
[23:01] doctor she said you know what let's go
[23:05] back let's call him back in here she
[23:08] said and I don't blame you for
[23:10] questioning that she and so he comes
[23:13] back in and he says let me tell you this
[23:17] is
[23:19] miscommunication he said there is no
[23:23] cancer in your
[23:26] eyes
[23:42] so I sat there I just shouted I cried I
[23:46] thank the Lord and so we're walking down
[23:48] the hall and and we tell her we said
[23:51] we're sorry we you know we had to wait
[23:54] and take away your time from lunch you
[23:56] know and she she said you didn't take
[23:59] away from me she Saidi don't blame you
[24:01] she said I would want to know and I
[24:04] would want to know and hear those words
[24:07] that you do not have cancer in your eyes
[24:11] and I want to thank God for
[24:26] that

[51:11] touch brother Ron's
[51:12] eyes and God
[51:15] [Music]
[51:17] did now we're believing that the stair
[51:19] or the seizures we're going to believe
[51:21] they leave

[51:28] prosper and if God be for us who can be

[51:37] Side
[51:39] amen amen he he's
[51:42] here what an honor it is to be here this
[51:45] weekend
[51:46] and uh two weeks ago I hadn't planned on
[51:50] it but I I just started texting brother
[51:53] Ron one morning and had been thinking
[51:55] about him and praying for him and and
[51:59] ask him you know when you ask him how
[52:01] he's
[52:02] doing you get the positive side so a lot
[52:06] of times I ask the ones that'll tell me
[52:10] the all of it but uh I didn't that time
[52:13] and so I was just he was sharing a few
[52:14] things we was going back and forth just
[52:16] talking about life and he said won't you
[52:18] come preach next weekend I said well I
[52:20] can't next weekend but let me see about
[52:22] the next and it worked out and we just
[52:24] have to believe sometimes that these
[52:26] things are orchestrated by God and not
[52:30] by
[52:31] man so I I know a lot of you and there's
[52:34] a lot of new faces now that I don't know
[52:36] but we all love one another in the Lord
[52:38] and and we're all one great big
[52:43] family you may not like me after tonight
[52:45] or tomorrow but the thing about it is
[52:47] brother Gabe you don't have a choice
[52:49] really when it comes to the marriage
[52:51] supper of the
[52:52] Lamb because whether you like me or not
[52:55] I'm going to be
[52:56] there and I hope that God sets me right
[52:59] across the table from the person that
[53:02] hates me the
[53:04] most I won't care my only desire is let
[53:08] me be there and let me worship the King
[53:11] of Kings and the Lord of lords for all
[53:17] eternity amen let's just go to the Lord
[53:20] in
[53:20] prayer Heavenly Father we come to you
[53:23] tonight Lord we count it in honor Lord
[53:26] to be gathered back in your house this
[53:28] evening worship you tonight Lord in
[53:31] spirit and in truth and father it's an
[53:33] honor to be back here in Virginia with
[53:35] our friends and we count them Lord as
[53:38] family and Lord we just pray tonight God
[53:41] that you would come and may you remove
[53:43] the vessel Lord and may you come by and
[53:46] speak to us in a supernatural way Lord
[53:49] and may you touch your children this
[53:51] evening Lord and give them Faith father
[53:53] and give them courage and give them
[53:55] strength Lord for the battles Lord that

[54:00] in trying times and we're at the end
[54:02] time but Lord greater is he that is in

[54:14] tonight Lord For Your Glory give me the
[54:16] right words Lord to say and father we
[54:19] yield it to you now and we'll be careful
[54:21] we'll give you all the glory and all the
[54:24] honor and all the praise
[54:25] and all the saints of God said amen amen
[54:30] if you have your Bibles turn with me to
[54:31] Jeremiah chapter
[54:41] 2 Jeremiah chapter 2 and verse 12 and
[54:48] 13 sure appreciate the hospitality
[54:51] brother Ron and brother Matt and brother
[54:54] Andrew has has shown us and and their
[54:56] wives and their families and you know
[54:59] it's we've we've known each other since
[55:01] 2006 now and you know in in
[55:05] 200 10 that didn't seem like too long
[55:08] ago but now it's 2024 and and we're all
[55:12] getting older and and so uh I might not
[55:16] run as fast as I used to run but I'm
[55:18] still
[55:19] running amen it's he that endureth to
[55:23] the end amen Jeremiah 2 and verse
[55:28] 12 be astonished oh ye Heavens at this
[55:33] and be horribly afraid and be you very
[55:35] desolate saeth the Lord for my people
[55:38] hath committed two evils they have
[55:41] forsaken me the Fountain of Living
[55:45] Waters and the second sin they hewed
[55:49] them out cister and not just a sister
[55:52] but a broken sist that can hold no water
[55:58] so it's leaking out all the joy all the
[56:03] happiness all the victory all the dance
[56:06] whatever it might be you put it in a
[56:08] cyen it's broken and it leaks
[56:11] out but if they would have stayed with
[56:15] the Fountain of Living
[56:18] Waters they would have had a fountain
[56:20] that never went dry may the Lord had his
[56:23] Blessing this evening you may be seated
[56:28] I'd like to speak tonight on what is
[56:31] real
[56:33] power we find here in the Bible that
[56:35] Israel is Accused by the prophet of two
[56:38] major sins they had turned from God and
[56:42] then they had made them
[56:44] aister that was a
[56:46] man-made Contraption to be able to
[56:50] capture
[56:52] water but these weren't just normal ones
[56:54] these were leaking so in some cases now
[56:58] if some of you younger ones don't know
[56:59] what a sistan is it's it's how you
[57:01] capture rainwater to be able to drink
[57:04] out of and I don't know who in the world
[57:06] invented that but who would want to
[57:08] drink out of something that
[57:11] had everything in
[57:15] it right but some of us was that way
[57:18] some of us were in denominations we were
[57:21] in man's Creeds we were in our own ideas
[57:24] and were drinking from a man-made
[57:29] Cesspool just put it plain you know
[57:32] where I'm from I'm from Arkansas so
[57:34] we're just
[57:36] playing but there's something about a
[57:38] sister that you must understand it does
[57:41] not produce
[57:46] anything it don't have no power within
[57:49] itself to be able to
[57:51] produce all it has in it is the ability
[57:54] to
[57:56] corrupt so therefore a sister can't be
[58:00] relied
[58:01] on it can't fill itself it has to depend
[58:05] on local re Reigns or local revivals
[58:09] little Revival here and a little Revival
[58:11] there well if you ever get the Fountain
[58:13] of Living Water you have a Revival from
[58:16] the day that you're born
[58:20] again it's always with you so it's not
[58:23] self-sufficient
[58:26] it depends on something else to fill it
[58:29] comes off the top of Barns and sheds and
[58:32] all the dirt and the dust and the you
[58:34] know some of you lives on farms you know
[58:36] what dust is there's all kinds of stuff
[58:39] mixed with it washes right off into the
[58:42] drinking water washes right down into a
[58:45] man-made
[58:46] tank we don't want that corrupting our
[58:50] churches in the
[58:52] message we don't want man-made IDE ideas
[58:55] corrupting us we have a Fountain of
[58:58] Living
[58:59] Water and we don't want to go out and
[59:02] build something that's going to
[59:06] leak that's why a lot of people they
[59:08] come a little waves and they quit come a
[59:09] little waves and they quit it's CU
[59:10] they're not built upon the right thing
[59:13] listen you ever get built up the
[59:15] Fountain of Living Waters it is an Aran
[59:19] well springing up
[59:23] self-supporting
[59:25] water that comes from it is fresh Pure
[59:30] Clean it's the unadulterated word of God
[59:34] it's coming from the hand of God it's
[59:36] that real it's got a secret of its power
[59:40] is within
[59:44] itself and if it's in itself then you
[59:47] don't have to prime it up you don't have
[59:50] to pump it up you don't have to push it
[59:52] up it bubbles up
[59:55] Hallelujah so now there's something else
[59:57] about aist where I really get the
[1:00:00] preaching or pond it's basically about
[1:00:03] the same
[1:00:05] thing when the temperature
[1:00:08] changes just a little bit gets a little
[1:00:11] bit colder it'll
[1:00:13] freeze when the atmosphere changes it
[1:00:17] freezes and it gets ice covered
[1:00:21] over like a lot of
[1:00:23] churches
[1:00:25] yeah church will get the same way if
[1:00:28] they don't stay in the spirit and they
[1:00:31] don't keep praying and they don't keep
[1:00:33] listening and they don't keep digging
[1:00:35] into the word of God then we'll get the
[1:00:38] atmosphere changes a little and we'll
[1:00:40] freeze over or will you know if it
[1:00:44] starts to thaw a little bit then you
[1:00:45] know you get on it you walk a little bit
[1:00:47] and then you fall in but an artisian
[1:00:50] well never
[1:00:53] changes it's got the flow all the time
[1:00:57] it's got that bubbling up on the inside
[1:00:59] of it and no matter how cold it gets a
[1:01:02] real artisian well will stay at bubble
[1:01:06] from all down
[1:01:08] within it's way down in
[1:01:11] there and it pushes everything that gets
[1:01:14] in its way
[1:01:23] out push it all out of it you remember
[1:01:26] the story brother actually preached a
[1:01:27] sermon on broken
[1:01:29] cens and he tells about this
[1:01:32] this bubbling artisian well that he used
[1:01:35] to drink out of and when he come up to
[1:01:38] it he said you know I thought my
[1:01:39] goodness this well is so happy and he
[1:01:41] said I took my hat off and I begin to
[1:01:43] think you know what is making this so
[1:01:46] happy why is it so bubbling and he said
[1:01:47] I thought well you know what I'm just
[1:01:48] going to talk to this well and if I
[1:01:50] could speak to it I would ask it a
[1:01:52] question why are you bubbling and so
[1:01:54] happy is it because that I drink from it
[1:01:57] and if it could answer it would say no
[1:01:59] brother Brandon it's not because you're
[1:02:00] drinking from me well it because the
[1:02:03] deer drink from you no it has nothing to
[1:02:05] do with the deer that's drinking from me
[1:02:08] well then why is it that you're always
[1:02:10] bubbling and if the well could speak it
[1:02:13] would say because there's something down
[1:02:16] on the inside of me that keeps pushing
[1:02:21] up and that's the way it is with a born
[1:02:23] again Christian you cannot contain
[1:02:27] it it's a Well of living water bubbling
[1:02:31] up into everlasting
[1:02:34] life and there's something about it you
[1:02:36] have nothing to do
[1:02:40] with man-made tanks of freeze they're
[1:02:43] begging for
[1:02:46] Revival what was it doing at ashbery
[1:02:48] they begging for Revival they were
[1:02:50] praying for Revival and they got some
[1:02:53] type of Revival but you know what a real
[1:02:55] Revival will do to a person it will
[1:02:58] cause you to go back to the
[1:03:02] word so you can tell if it's a word
[1:03:05] Revival it causes you to fall in love
[1:03:07] with the
[1:03:09] word and when you fall in love with the
[1:03:12] word you have a Revival all the
[1:03:16] time Sunday morning Saturday
[1:03:19] night it's bubbling up on the inside of
[1:03:22] you it's 365 days a
[1:03:25] year pure clean fresh it's that word
[1:03:31] bubbling vindicating
[1:03:34] itself speaking itself for
[1:03:39] itself don't matter whether the rain's
[1:03:41] coming whether it's snowing whether it's
[1:03:42] whatever the weather is if the holy
[1:03:44] spirit's in there it's
[1:03:47] bubbling it's happy all the time it's
[1:03:51] kind of like brother B said you get a
[1:03:53] man drunk on the Holy Ghost he's drunk
[1:03:55] every day of his life listen you don't
[1:03:58] find him today well I don't know if I'm
[1:04:00] saved and I don't know if I've got it
[1:04:02] and and I don't know and I I tell you
[1:04:03] what it's just been the worst day of my
[1:04:05] life brother Jason I've just had it so
[1:04:11] bad you know some days I think that on
[1:04:13] Sundays I think boy i' I just don't feel
[1:04:15] like preaching
[1:04:17] today and then I think well brother
[1:04:20] Ron's probably preaching
[1:04:23] so
[1:04:31] and I do realize we ain't all built the
[1:04:34] same me and Andrew don't had this
[1:04:36] conversation we ain't all built the
[1:04:38] same we might have a little gumption but
[1:04:41] that's a
[1:04:49] bulldog when he's down he's still happy
[1:04:55] right when he's got the walls and
[1:04:56] everything stacked against him he still
[1:04:59] has a song in his heart that's any real
[1:05:02] believer when their backs against the
[1:05:04] wall they still
[1:05:06] believe they don't give up you don't
[1:05:09] quit when the when things get
[1:05:12] tough you still go to
[1:05:19] war cuz there's a hidden
[1:05:22] power it's the secret that lies within
[1:05:29] you I didn't tell you this brother Ron
[1:05:31] but I told Andrew this I said can you
[1:05:32] imagine being in a boxing ring with
[1:05:38] you huh I didn't understand I told my
[1:05:42] wife I said you imagine he would beat
[1:05:44] you to death cuz he don't know when to
[1:05:47] quit but it's a good trait to have
[1:05:51] listen every believer ought to have that
[1:05:55] I'm going to fight I'm going to keep
[1:05:58] fighting listen my real power is not
[1:06:01] within me it's within him that he placed
[1:06:05] within
[1:06:07] me so you don't pull it up pump it up
[1:06:10] pray it up pray it down it's just
[1:06:14] there and it's a fountain filled with
[1:06:16] blood where Sinners plunge beneath the
[1:06:19] flood lose all their guilty stains you
[1:06:21] don't make a church member out of that
[1:06:23] kind of a person
[1:06:24] you make Christians out of them
[1:06:29] kind a Fountain of Living Waters it's
[1:06:33] pumping has no listen its power he said
[1:06:36] is within itself it needs no priming
[1:06:40] it's it its own life is in itself and
[1:06:44] the seed of God is in a man's heart the
[1:06:47] life of God is within the individual not
[1:06:49] in the church in you it's in you you're
[1:06:54] the one that has the germ of life in
[1:06:57] you it's not the church
[1:07:00] building it's
[1:07:05] you those those who God fornew before
[1:07:08] the foundation of the world he has
[1:07:10] ordained to
[1:07:12] this listen the rest of them will never
[1:07:15] see it you don't know why people can't
[1:07:18] see the message they wouldn't ordained
[1:07:20] to it they wasn't predestinated to be
[1:07:23] able to catch the revelation of this
[1:07:28] hour but thank God there is
[1:07:31] some that regardless what man says
[1:07:34] regardless when they were things stacked
[1:07:36] against them they'll always know the
[1:07:39] Bible said it
[1:07:47] so I had a guy here a while back it's
[1:07:49] been year or so ago he started texting
[1:07:52] me all this nonsense
[1:07:54] and he said uh don't you think brother
[1:07:57] brandham should have rephrased some
[1:07:59] things for today's culture don't you
[1:08:02] think it's a little out of
[1:08:05] order I knew where that demon was coming
[1:08:09] from yeah he done attack the wrong guy
[1:08:12] on that one so I let it go for a little
[1:08:15] while cuz he was kin to
[1:08:21] me bless his heart
[1:08:25] but he kept on with his nonsense and
[1:08:27] kept sending me messages and finally I
[1:08:30] just had all I could handle well don't
[1:08:33] you know brother Brandon was wrong here
[1:08:34] and he was wrong you're a
[1:08:38] liar you're a liar and he kept on with
[1:08:41] that nonsense and finally I said listen
[1:08:44] man I ain't got time to talk about it I
[1:08:47] believe it that's
[1:08:50] it well are you afraid to talk about it
[1:08:54] I said listen boy I ain't afraid of
[1:08:56] anything you
[1:08:58] got I don't have to defend this message
[1:09:02] God shall defend it he's already
[1:09:05] Vindicated it it's thus sayith the
[1:09:09] [Applause]
[1:09:19] Lord so with my phone I go
[1:09:25] Block it's on messenger so then he
[1:09:27] starts texting me and I go
[1:09:31] block you want to talk to me you talk to
[1:09:34] me about what I
[1:09:35] believe you don't come talk to me and
[1:09:38] trash what I believe cuz that's a good
[1:09:41] way not to talk to
[1:09:44] me and I was cocked and loaded I had to
[1:09:46] do a funeral for my uncle I was cocked
[1:09:48] and loading I'm like I hope he says
[1:09:50] something to
[1:09:52] me
[1:09:55] but no he's a keyboard
[1:09:56] Warrior so he didn't have the nerve to
[1:09:58] face me he was there but he wouldn't say
[1:10:01] nothing cuz I done made my mind up what
[1:10:04] I was going to say why have you allowed
[1:10:06] the devil to put it in your heart to
[1:10:09] come against the sword of God why have
[1:10:13] you allowed Satan to henter
[1:10:15] [Applause]
[1:10:20] you the problem is he has no power
[1:10:24] right he don't know where power lays
[1:10:27] power lays within the word and within
[1:10:31] the
[1:10:32] seed how many there's a power within the
[1:10:34] seed that God has deposited in you and
[1:10:37] if it's in there you didn't choose for
[1:10:39] it to be in there God chose you to put
[1:10:42] it in there and if it's not in there you
[1:10:45] can't make it in
[1:10:48] there so I called my cousin I called his
[1:10:52] sister and I said what what's up with
[1:10:54] this
[1:10:55] dude you know it's off the deep end I
[1:10:58] said you even believe there's a God well
[1:11:00] he's not sure I said I can't talk to him
[1:11:03] I cannot have an intelligent
[1:11:04] conversation with somebody who is
[1:11:06] ignorant enough to believe that
[1:11:08] everything just
[1:11:11] boom hey if you want to get real we can
[1:11:14] talk but if you want to tell me about
[1:11:17] Darwin I ain't got no time for that cuz
[1:11:20] I got something that's
[1:11:22] real and this don't need no pumping up
[1:11:25] priming up it comes from within you it's
[1:11:29] bubbling on the inside of
[1:11:34] you that's the way the seat of God is in
[1:11:36] a man's heart it's just there one day it
[1:11:40] crosses the
[1:11:42] light Gabe one day it crossed you you
[1:11:45] was raised in it you was probably pushed
[1:11:48] down your throat in it somewhat you was
[1:11:52] made to go to church you didn't want to
[1:11:54] go to church not
[1:11:56] really but one day you did one day he
[1:12:00] reached down his hand and he spoke to
[1:12:02] you and he changed
[1:12:04] you huh and then that's where the real
[1:12:07] power
[1:12:11] was rest of them is never going to see
[1:12:13] it Jesus said no man can come to me
[1:12:15] except my father draws him first and all
[1:12:17] that the father ha given me might
[1:12:21] come will come
[1:12:24] Hallelujah so there stood
[1:12:26] Judas he had a light shining up here but
[1:12:30] back down in his heart was a dark
[1:12:34] seed and when The Showdown come the
[1:12:37] darkness
[1:12:38] showed because it always does during a
[1:12:42] showdown then there's a little woman at
[1:12:44] the
[1:12:46] well she's all black up here in the
[1:12:49] front but down in here was a
[1:12:52] predestinated seat
[1:12:55] and when the light come to her it
[1:12:57] scattered the darkness out of her life
[1:13:00] and she said sir we know when Messiah
[1:13:02] comes that he'll tell us these things
[1:13:05] and Jesus said I'm
[1:13:08] he I mean and her life was exposed and
[1:13:12] she runs into the
[1:13:14] city
[1:13:19] sadly I got something to tell you man I
[1:13:22] Met m
[1:13:24] I'm just going to tell you right now if
[1:13:25] you ever meet him he changes
[1:13:29] you and when she met him she ran into
[1:13:32] the City and said come see a man that
[1:13:35] told me everything I ever did and he
[1:13:38] told her one thing according to the
[1:13:41] scripture that's all we know he may have
[1:13:44] told her other things but that's all we
[1:13:45] know but she
[1:13:46] knew she's
[1:13:48] open he's he he he's done seeing
[1:13:51] everything he needed to see
[1:13:53] so when it's back down here it's a
[1:13:57] genuine predestinated seed when the
[1:14:00] light comes down here and it drives all
[1:14:03] the darkness away from you and puts you
[1:14:05] in fellowship with
[1:14:07] Christ he's the one that gave you life
[1:14:10] before the foundation of the world to
[1:14:11] begin
[1:14:12] with otherwise you never see it oh
[1:14:16] brother Jason we got all the mechanics
[1:14:18] down right we got everything going right
[1:14:21] in the mechanic field
[1:14:23] that's
[1:14:25] good glad you got the
[1:14:29] mechanics you know how to dress you know
[1:14:32] how to act you know how to conduct
[1:14:34] yourself in the house of God you got all
[1:14:35] those that's good that's part of it but
[1:14:39] that ain't all of
[1:14:41] it mechanics will only cause you to be a
[1:14:44] church
[1:14:45] member but you're going to have to have
[1:14:48] something else with it that causes you
[1:14:50] to
[1:14:52] live
[1:14:53] mechanics won't make the engine
[1:14:56] run but when you put that octane
[1:14:59] gasoline in there and then the fire
[1:15:01] begins to strike
[1:15:03] it a combustion takes place he's the
[1:15:07] same yesterday today and forever
[1:15:10] amen his word never changes
[1:15:17] Amen brother Ram goes that's the
[1:15:21] resurrection that's the real power of
[1:15:23] God mechanics with the Dynamics notice
[1:15:28] it's the
[1:15:29] spirit that
[1:15:31] quickens so mechanics without the
[1:15:35] spirit is no good listen or brother
[1:15:39] there I shout and I scream and I do all
[1:15:41] these things that's great I love to do
[1:15:42] the same thing I ain't got nothing
[1:15:43] against that you know that but the thing
[1:15:45] about it is that's the blessings Fallen
[1:15:48] but then let a life come in you the
[1:15:51] spirit of God comes in you and causes
[1:15:53] you to put the word on display and it
[1:15:56] actually puts a life behind your
[1:16:02] worship that's what it's all about let's
[1:16:06] get life behind us let's get life in us
[1:16:10] let it Bubble Up in us then it's not
[1:16:13] just a church
[1:16:17] service brother Jason where I used to go
[1:16:20] in it was dead than 3:00 well
[1:16:24] it usually ain't
[1:16:28] here
[1:16:31] huh maybe you don't know what it's like
[1:16:33] to be in a dead
[1:16:36] church I've been there done that don't
[1:16:39] plan on ever going
[1:16:41] back I want something that's got
[1:16:44] life something that can give
[1:16:47] life listen I'm not just talking about
[1:16:50] all of our worship I'm talking about
[1:16:51] real Godly living that'll cause a person
[1:16:55] to live right talk right treat your
[1:16:58] neighbor
[1:17:00] right and the rest of it will follow
[1:17:05] it mechanics don't run the church it's
[1:17:07] the Dynamics the holy ghost that gets
[1:17:10] into this
[1:17:12] word that causes it to
[1:17:16] work you can have power and not have the
[1:17:20] Holy
[1:17:22] Ghost
[1:17:24] Samson had a hidden
[1:17:26] power but because there he wasn't where
[1:17:29] he needed to be with God he got weak
[1:17:33] spiritually we all know the
[1:17:36] story my brother told me the other day
[1:17:38] he said Jason just spit it out 15
[1:17:41] minutes we can have it all man you don't
[1:17:44] need to preach an hour and a half just
[1:17:46] give it to us we can handle it if you
[1:17:49] want to know exactly how he is right set
[1:17:52] not over a map they're
[1:17:56] clones you get them two together it
[1:17:58] would be
[1:17:59] bad sister Mary you know
[1:18:02] him but the thing about it is you know
[1:18:04] we're here to Feast on the unfailing
[1:18:07] body word of the son of
[1:18:10] man if a guy preaches an hour and a half
[1:18:13] or he preaches 30 minutes just know your
[1:18:15] limitations of where you need to be
[1:18:17] preaching that's the key you can preach
[1:18:20] as long as you want as long as the
[1:18:21] spirit's moving
[1:18:23] right so don't ever just let it become a
[1:18:25] church
[1:18:28] Gathering don't get like
[1:18:30] Samson get rocked
[1:18:32] asleep by a
[1:18:36] woman Samson tell me your power show me
[1:18:40] your power where is your power where
[1:18:43] does your strength lie and so he starts
[1:18:45] entertaining it a little well if you buy
[1:18:49] me with new
[1:18:51] Roots if you do this to
[1:18:54] me bust his
[1:18:57] him finally she said Samson why have you
[1:19:00] lied to me tell me where your power lays
[1:19:03] he had got
[1:19:06] comfortable with his head and the lap of
[1:19:10] Delilah he got used to being
[1:19:13] there she petted him she told him how
[1:19:16] much she loved him and how handsome he
[1:19:19] was and blah blah blah blah blah and
[1:19:22] when you you get older they don't tell
[1:19:23] you that
[1:19:29] anymore amen thank
[1:19:32] you but the thing is is he begin to lose
[1:19:36] his
[1:19:37] identity first before he ever lost his
[1:19:40] power because he flirted with the world
[1:19:43] instead of staying true to God listen
[1:19:46] church and he finally when he tells her
[1:19:48] his secret she brings the Philistines in
[1:19:50] they cut his hair off and he jumps up
[1:19:52] I'll defeat him again but he didn't have
[1:19:54] no
[1:19:57] strength he lost everything he had in a
[1:20:01] moment's
[1:20:02] time and not only that he lost his sight
[1:20:06] they took him down there and made a
[1:20:07] slave out of
[1:20:09] him listen Church we've come too far in
[1:20:11] this to be slaves now we don't need to
[1:20:14] go back to Egypt and be a slave to the
[1:20:16] devil no longer you've come out of Egypt
[1:20:19] stay out of
[1:20:21] Egypt stay the promised
[1:20:25] land you go back to Egypt you lose your
[1:20:30] power Samson Lost His sight I say God
[1:20:32] help us tonight keep our eyes on the
[1:20:34] word God don't let me ever become
[1:20:42] critical you ever been critical before
[1:20:45] all right there's five of us in here
[1:20:46] that's honest okay we'll have a prayer
[1:20:49] meeting for the rest of you at the
[1:20:51] end
[1:20:54] the prophet got
[1:20:56] critical but it didn't make it right but
[1:20:59] then he had to
[1:21:01] repent and he said this on his African
[1:21:04] trip or his India report
[1:21:06] rather he said I come back and and first
[1:21:09] thing was placed in my hands was the
[1:21:11] voice of healing and I seen AA Allen's
[1:21:13] meeting and seen how scriptural that it
[1:21:15] is and then I criticized
[1:21:19] it and I thank Lord them poor people
[1:21:22] lovely people was out there following
[1:21:23] that and seeing him going him hones
[1:21:25] hearted people and I looked around and I
[1:21:27] seen all the other things that goes on
[1:21:29] and I started criticizing in my
[1:21:32] heart and he says I don't want to get
[1:21:34] that way if I do that I will lose favor
[1:21:38] with
[1:21:42] God and that's the last thing we want to
[1:21:45] do he said then I looked at America and
[1:21:48] I I seen how they dressed and I seen all
[1:21:50] the the sins and stuff America was in
[1:21:52] and people who claim to be Christians
[1:21:53] and doing all the things of the world he
[1:21:55] said it nauseated me and when I think of
[1:21:58] the other side is and then this look
[1:22:01] between I think oh God he said but hear
[1:22:05] this whose battle is
[1:22:09] it God said let the weeds and the wheat
[1:22:13] grow
[1:22:15] together and then the Angels would come
[1:22:17] and do the
[1:22:21] separating so then he says this I'll
[1:22:24] move on so help me as I stand here with
[1:22:26] my hand up at the pull pit help me to
[1:22:28] criticize
[1:22:31] nobody help me God will you give me a
[1:22:34] spirit in my heart instead of
[1:22:36] criticizing it I will love them anyhow
[1:22:40] and go
[1:22:42] on that's real
[1:22:45] power when a man can take people and see
[1:22:48] the sin you see if you're a prophet like
[1:22:50] he was he he didn't look at things like
[1:22:52] you and I did he looked at him through
[1:22:55] Supernatural eagle eyes and when he saw
[1:22:59] sin it made him
[1:23:02] sick should make us
[1:23:05] sick but it made him nauseated to think
[1:23:08] about it and when he was nauseated then
[1:23:11] God began to deal with
[1:23:13] him whose battle is
[1:23:16] it something don't go like you like it
[1:23:18] in the church whose battle is
[1:23:21] it
[1:23:23] we're not going to always all agree 100%
[1:23:26] of the time we're humans we're going to
[1:23:29] have
[1:23:30] disagreements but the key factor is we
[1:23:32] do have one thing in
[1:23:35] common that's the message of this hour
[1:23:38] and this revealed word this thing we do
[1:23:41] have in common and this we do believe
[1:23:46] together and this is what we'll fight
[1:23:51] for enough of this this fighting in the
[1:23:53] front yard between
[1:23:55] Believers we ought to stand together in
[1:23:58] the front yard discuss our problems in
[1:24:01] the
[1:24:03] [Applause]
[1:24:06] backyard and say God give me the courage
[1:24:09] give me the faith give me the ability to
[1:24:12] submit myself to your word give me that
[1:24:14] real holy ghost
[1:24:18] power the spirit of God's not something
[1:24:20] that's schooled into you it's something
[1:24:22] that's predestinated into
[1:24:25] you by the hand of almighty God
[1:24:29] hallelujah we don't have no power on our
[1:24:31] own we're
[1:24:35] helpless didn't Jesus say I do nothing
[1:24:37] till the father shows me
[1:24:40] first sister brandham brother bram's
[1:24:43] mother she would say Bill what's going
[1:24:44] to be my outcome when she got sick she
[1:24:46] was
[1:24:47] dying and he said I don't know mother
[1:24:51] until God shows me I can't tell you
[1:24:54] anything because if I do I'm a failure
[1:24:57] to begin with right so I have to make
[1:25:00] sure that I don't tell you something
[1:25:03] that's not correct so I have to
[1:25:06] wait and he said we are only God's
[1:25:11] agents to which God can work through and
[1:25:14] God works his own will through but see
[1:25:16] but he said but it's when those super
[1:25:18] duper people that's always having this
[1:25:21] and they this and the other he goes you
[1:25:22] better stay away from that somebody's
[1:25:25] always got the
[1:25:27] answers well stay away from him he said
[1:25:33] right because Jesus himself didn't do
[1:25:36] that he waited till the father showed
[1:25:41] him and that's real power because you're
[1:25:43] controlling
[1:25:47] yourself when you can control
[1:25:50] yourself that's real power
[1:25:52] you can control this and
[1:25:56] this that's
[1:25:58] power well brother I I could shake the
[1:26:01] building down well great you might could
[1:26:03] even beat me in arm
[1:26:05] wrestling probably probably Ally
[1:26:11] could I never was any good at it but
[1:26:15] that's not the kind of power we're
[1:26:16] looking at we're looking at a power that
[1:26:19] causes you to live an overcoming life a
[1:26:23] power that can come into the church get
[1:26:25] sin out of the way and let healings take
[1:26:28] place and let Miracles take
[1:26:32] place we're looking at the kind of power
[1:26:34] that came at the day of Pentecost the
[1:26:38] original so don't just go by an
[1:26:40] experience you got to go by the word
[1:26:43] too you got to get away with an
[1:26:45] experience as am measuring line if it
[1:26:47] don't line up with a word but if it
[1:26:49] lines up with a word run with it
[1:26:53] there's one Plum line in this hour and
[1:26:55] it is a revealed word of the
[1:26:59] hour that's the word repent be baptized
[1:27:03] in the name of Jesus Christ and you
[1:27:05] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:06] for the remission of sins you shall
[1:27:07] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[1:27:09] Paul said have you received the Holy
[1:27:11] Ghost since you
[1:27:14] believed now Prophet said that's the
[1:27:16] whole of the problem right there people
[1:27:18] repent of their sins they get baptized
[1:27:20] in water but they don't go on and
[1:27:23] receive the Holy Ghost you believe unto
[1:27:26] the receiving the spirit Believing on
[1:27:28] Jesus just a step in the right direction
[1:27:31] which is toward the Holy Ghost people
[1:27:32] stop there they go as far as the water
[1:27:34] and they stop and they believe and they
[1:27:36] stop the Bible does not say you receive
[1:27:39] it when you believe but have you
[1:27:41] received it since you
[1:27:44] believed that's the reason people don't
[1:27:46] have any power in their lives they
[1:27:49] stopped short of a true
[1:27:51] Pentecost they don't know God in the
[1:27:54] power of his resurrection they know him
[1:27:57] appear but they never Dro this brother
[1:28:00] jeel said it ain't never dropped 18 Ines
[1:28:02] to get down here into your heart but
[1:28:04] once it gets down in here brother Jason
[1:28:06] we need the power well the word had to
[1:28:08] come first and with the restoration of
[1:28:10] the word it brings a restoration of the
[1:28:15] power that's why we can say Satan get
[1:28:19] thee behind
[1:28:21] me Satan leave in the name of Jesus
[1:28:27] Christ had a good friend of mine last
[1:28:31] week his son texted me he was a friend
[1:28:33] and he said they had take her I think it
[1:28:36] was son yeah running dad to the
[1:28:38] emergency room he's having chest
[1:28:41] pains well they got him in there and
[1:28:43] started running tests and he'd had
[1:28:45] pneumonia and so they started checking
[1:28:48] him for his heart and found out he had a
[1:28:49] 99% blockage so they went there with the
[1:28:52] exent and fixed it but they couldn't
[1:28:53] keep his blood pressure
[1:28:56] regulated so the very next day I called
[1:28:58] him I said our text Luke and I said hey
[1:29:00] man how's your daddy doing man that
[1:29:02] can't regulate his blood pressure just
[1:29:04] up and down up and down I said really
[1:29:07] yeah I said Okay that was I don't know
[1:29:11] four or five o'clock so I just started
[1:29:14] praying Lord help
[1:29:17] St touch him he's not a believer of the
[1:29:20] message that's don't
[1:29:25] matter there's a power within the
[1:29:29] bride to use the word so I just said
[1:29:32] Lord touch him next day I text Luke or
[1:29:35] called him I said hey how's your dad
[1:29:37] goes man the craziest thing happened he
[1:29:40] said last night about 6:00 after I
[1:29:41] talked to you dad's blood pressure ly
[1:29:43] out and it's been perfect ever since I
[1:29:46] said
[1:29:48] really kind felt like thought about
[1:29:50] brother Brandon when he was up there on
[1:29:51] the mountain and storm left and he come
[1:29:53] down they said there's a great storm
[1:29:54] coming but all a sudden they just laugh
[1:29:55] and he goes
[1:29:57] really so I text his dad and I said hey
[1:30:00] man I've been praying for
[1:30:01] you thanks buddy he
[1:30:04] said see they know where God
[1:30:07] moves you don't always have to tell
[1:30:09] everybody everything just be a light to
[1:30:13] them huh just let them give them a
[1:30:15] little bit at a time and then when they
[1:30:17] take that you give them a little bit
[1:30:18] more and you take that and you give them
[1:30:20] a little bit more
[1:30:23] we have a brother at the church just
[1:30:25] last month he come up he was standing
[1:30:26] right there for prayer and I was
[1:30:27] preaching I said we can lay hands on you
[1:30:29] and cast you know anoint you with oil
[1:30:32] and pray for you or you could be like
[1:30:33] the Roman Centurion be under just speak
[1:30:36] the word and that man so helped me he's
[1:30:39] standing there with his hands up he
[1:30:40] turns around he says at Thy word Lord
[1:30:42] and he walked right back to his seat
[1:30:44] praising God now he had a heart
[1:30:47] condition and he went like the next week
[1:30:49] for a heart cath and there was a
[1:30:51] afraid's going to have to go in there
[1:30:53] and change some heart valves out so they
[1:30:55] didn't do anything that day they didn't
[1:30:57] tell him anything either come back three
[1:31:00] weeks or whatever see the
[1:31:02] surgeon walks into the surgeon's office
[1:31:05] two weeks ago I think it was and they
[1:31:07] said uh well got good
[1:31:10] news you don't need heart bowel
[1:31:12] replacement
[1:31:14] surgery and you don't need open heart
[1:31:16] surgery come back and see me in six
[1:31:20] months see but it was because he
[1:31:24] believed the real power was already
[1:31:27] within him all he had to do is
[1:31:30] Gras I ain't against praying for people
[1:31:33] laying hands but the greater thing is
[1:31:35] you to receive the
[1:31:38] word Hallelujah Lord be unto me
[1:31:42] sometimes we need those hands to help
[1:31:44] build our faith because our faith ain't
[1:31:47] always on the same level each
[1:31:50] trial
[1:31:54] and so we have to have somebody to come
[1:31:56] help
[1:31:57] us put my faith in the word of God let
[1:32:01] me know Lord not because I got a miracle
[1:32:04] cuz I've had my share and if he never
[1:32:06] gave me another one I know he's a
[1:32:09] miracle
[1:32:11] worker but just because he heals my body
[1:32:13] is no proof of my forgiveness the proof
[1:32:16] is is my faith in his word that has
[1:32:19] changed my life and now my experience is
[1:32:23] lining up with his
[1:32:26] word hallelujah what we need today is
[1:32:28] another baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[1:32:30] the real power of God that identifies
[1:32:33] the
[1:32:34] works that Jesus did that was promised
[1:32:37] for this
[1:32:40] day not so much as what was promised for
[1:32:43] another day what do you promise in this
[1:32:46] day I will pour out my spirit upon All
[1:32:50] Flesh
[1:32:53] they'll prophesy they'll see Visions
[1:32:56] they'll see dreams right did he not tell
[1:32:59] us that that's what Joel told us and
[1:33:01] this is that which was prophesied this
[1:33:05] is the restoration of the word that has
[1:33:08] come and now the restoration of the
[1:33:10] power is here
[1:33:15] also when Jesus brought the man to him
[1:33:18] he said arise take up thy bed first he
[1:33:22] actually said thy sins be forgiven go
[1:33:24] and send no more send him away and they
[1:33:25] said who has power to forgive sins he
[1:33:27] goes or would it be easier for me to say
[1:33:28] arise take up your bed and go home huh
[1:33:31] he had it
[1:33:33] all and that's the thing church we have
[1:33:35] it within our grasp we have it in our
[1:33:38] hands what are we going to do with
[1:33:42] it what are you going to do with this
[1:33:45] Jesus call
[1:33:49] Christ well brother Jason I I just
[1:33:51] really don't
[1:33:53] know I just think sometimes y'all go
[1:33:55] overboard you preachers y'all go
[1:33:58] overboard with getting
[1:34:04] excited you
[1:34:08] think if you've been where some of us
[1:34:11] have
[1:34:13] been brother they wonder why you get so
[1:34:16] happy sometimes maybe but if you been
[1:34:18] where he
[1:34:20] been
[1:34:22] if you was where he was if you walked
[1:34:25] where he
[1:34:26] walked if you've been through what I've
[1:34:28] been through then you might know why I
[1:34:31] get
[1:34:32] excited you might know why I Want To
[1:34:35] Praise Him you might know why I love
[1:34:40] him Hallelujah he came all the way down
[1:34:43] from glory to pick me
[1:34:47] up when I was a sinner when I had habits
[1:34:53] when I couldn't
[1:34:56] overcome there was always a
[1:35:03] hand Jesus said I'll never leave you
[1:35:05] I'll never forsake you but I'll go with
[1:35:07] you to the end and your path may not be
[1:35:11] easy but you're going to make
[1:35:15] it it won't always be the easiest
[1:35:18] road but if you'll come into full
[1:35:21] obedience to my
[1:35:23] word it entitles you to the token and
[1:35:27] when the token is in your life when the
[1:35:29] word is in
[1:35:31] you then it becomes Christ in
[1:35:36] you then we're not looking behind us
[1:35:39] we're not looking ahead of us we're
[1:35:41] looking at what he's doing now and today
[1:35:44] is the day of salvation now is the time
[1:35:48] to give it all to
[1:35:50] God I I ain't felt power in my life in
[1:35:52] forever I tell you it's high time you
[1:35:54] start
[1:35:59] praying let me give you
[1:36:02] this we okay on time all
[1:36:08] right today we got the wrong conception
[1:36:10] of power he said from that time
[1:36:12] 1961 power is
[1:36:16] overcoming returning good for evil yeah
[1:36:23] am how many's ever had to do that all of
[1:36:27] us
[1:36:28] okay he goes that's real power that you
[1:36:32] can love your
[1:36:34] enemy and do good to those that do evil
[1:36:37] to you I like to use another one at home
[1:36:40] some ever so often I'll use this quote
[1:36:41] brother said you must like
[1:36:46] everybody you see the looks on some of
[1:36:48] them faces brother
[1:36:50] Jason
[1:36:52] I didn't say it he
[1:36:54] did like and love everybody okay well
[1:36:56] that's not in this quot so we'll preach
[1:36:58] that another
[1:37:00] time that you love your enemy do good to
[1:37:04] those that do evil to you that's real
[1:37:08] power that's God
[1:37:10] power Maniacs can break chains but it
[1:37:14] takes a real man that can return good
[1:37:17] for evil from his heart because not
[1:37:21] because of a religious duty but from his
[1:37:27] heart and he said and we're always
[1:37:29] complaining about what the world and how
[1:37:32] how the world is and how Wicked the
[1:37:35] world is I didn't realize they part of
[1:37:38] the same quote how Wicked the world is
[1:37:42] don't we say that this is a wicked
[1:37:44] generation it's horrible put your kids
[1:37:47] on the street it's just horrible you
[1:37:49] don't know somebody's going to shoot you
[1:37:50] when you walk out the house
[1:37:52] it's a wicked world but we fail to
[1:37:55] realize he said you forget to realize
[1:37:58] how much more
[1:38:00] powerful the church is than it used to
[1:38:06] be Hallelujah so the world's getting
[1:38:10] more wickeder but the church is getting
[1:38:12] more
[1:38:15] powerful Hallelujah so Samson Shake
[1:38:18] Yourself wake yourself up in PR
[1:38:24] and realize your greatest Victory will
[1:38:27] be when you
[1:38:29] confess that you've been
[1:38:33] wrong and when he Shu
[1:38:36] himself I just heard the prophet say it
[1:38:38] this afternoon he goes they didn't
[1:38:40] notice Samson's lips
[1:38:42] moving when he's grinding at the
[1:38:47] meal he didn't even say he was praying
[1:38:50] out loud
[1:38:52] right here sometimes when you pray out
[1:38:54] loud the devil hears it but when you
[1:38:56] keep it in your heart the prophet said
[1:38:57] the devil can't hear
[1:38:59] that and he's sitting there praying Lord
[1:39:02] forgive
[1:39:05] me I failed you God I was born to
[1:39:08] destroy the
[1:39:10] enemy that's what you're born for to
[1:39:14] destroy your
[1:39:16] enemy Lord I I I Repent I'm sorry and
[1:39:19] and he's Samson's going through the
[1:39:21] thing no doubt all kinds of memories
[1:39:22] flood in his mind if I hadn't went that
[1:39:27] way if I have just listened to my father
[1:39:29] and mother if I hadn't went that way and
[1:39:33] I'd have stayed with the right girl I
[1:39:36] wouldn't be here
[1:39:42] right every thought's Crossing through
[1:39:44] his mind and he's
[1:39:45] grinding and he says Lord forgive me I'm
[1:39:49] ready now to die
[1:39:52] die to surrender to give up everything
[1:39:56] God I'm ready I'm to the point now Lord
[1:39:58] I'm broken I have nothing else to look
[1:40:00] forward to I can't see anymore I've lost
[1:40:02] my sight but God I was born for a
[1:40:05] purpose and Lord I'm asking you to
[1:40:08] restore my
[1:40:11] power give me my power back God God says
[1:40:14] you got to be willing to
[1:40:17] die I'm willing Lord to die of
[1:40:21] everything of this
[1:40:28] world his greatest victory over the
[1:40:30] enemy was at his end
[1:40:34] time and the greatest victory over the
[1:40:36] devil is going to be at the end time
[1:40:40] whenever Devil's going to be under your
[1:40:43] feet Hallelujah well brother I'm just
[1:40:46] the souls on the bottom of the feet
[1:40:47] that's a good thing cuz the devil's
[1:40:49] still under you
[1:40:51] he ain't got on top of you
[1:40:53] yet Samson said I'm ready and they bring
[1:40:56] him out and they start making a sport of
[1:40:58] him they have a big
[1:41:01] rally and his greatest Victory he
[1:41:04] overcomes
[1:41:07] himself and what he thought he could
[1:41:11] do without Christ we can't do
[1:41:15] nothing you understand we are helpless
[1:41:18] we're worthless without Christ we need
[1:41:21] him more today than we've ever needed
[1:41:23] him and in the morning you'll need him
[1:41:26] more tomorrow than you ever needed
[1:41:29] him temptation's going to come and
[1:41:33] you're going to need
[1:41:34] him the greatest Victory is at his
[1:41:38] end and he says to the lad cuz Samson
[1:41:42] remembered there had to be some pillars
[1:41:45] that held up the
[1:41:49] building
[1:41:51] sunny boy put my hands on the pillars
[1:41:56] they still wasn't watching
[1:41:57] Samson they done too caught up in making
[1:42:01] fun like people do
[1:42:03] us make fun of us for the way we worship
[1:42:06] God in the way we live and the and the
[1:42:08] way we do things and because we believe
[1:42:10] in our prophet and believe his message
[1:42:12] and they make fun of us that's
[1:42:14] okay cuz what I'm going to do is Lord
[1:42:17] let me lift my hands let me put them on
[1:42:20] the pillars Lord this is the end time
[1:42:22] God let this be our greatest
[1:42:28] Victory and he wrestles them on the
[1:42:30] pillars and he starts praying Lord now's
[1:42:33] my time to
[1:42:34] go give me the power and another thing
[1:42:38] they failed to see is during those
[1:42:39] months into prison his
[1:42:42] hair got back down to where he had locks
[1:42:46] again yeah the power had been restored
[1:42:50] Samson knew knew the power he could feel
[1:42:52] the
[1:42:53] power I know it's back now I'm just
[1:42:56] waiting for the right time to take out
[1:42:59] the
[1:43:02] enemy the power is
[1:43:14] there it's
[1:43:17] there let's just put it this way
[1:43:21] what was the date you was at doctor
[1:43:23] Wednesday Tuesday Tuesday
[1:43:26] Tuesday brother Ron was sitting her in
[1:43:28] the office and he was still down we're
[1:43:32] going to take one of your
[1:43:34] eyes and you're going to lose your
[1:43:37] sight and we give you two months to
[1:43:47] live but he's praying oh he he's
[1:43:51] troubled here but not down here cuz down
[1:43:56] here there's something happening his
[1:43:58] little wife sitting there praying God do
[1:44:00] a
[1:44:01] miracle she said I could see the changes
[1:44:04] in his face but God was
[1:44:07] working may I put it this way the locks
[1:44:10] had begun to
[1:44:13] grow and he reached back there and he
[1:44:15] got a hold of the
[1:44:16] locks when that doctor walked in there
[1:44:19] he said there is no cancer he grabbed
[1:44:22] them rocks
[1:44:24] Hallelujah listen Church that'll make
[1:44:26] you dance a little dance right there
[1:44:28] when you realize the power has not
[1:44:39] left and if God did that much can he not
[1:44:43] take the rest of
[1:44:49] that

[1:44:59] of the
[1:45:01] word and the word said healing is my
[1:45:08] bread it might not be a major but it's
[1:45:11] pretty major when it's
[1:45:14] you oh but it's still yet bread so we
[1:45:18] still yet have to eat yeah so we take of
[1:45:21] the word of God and we eat the part that
[1:45:24] we need for the season that we are
[1:45:28] in it's part of our
[1:45:33] power we have the authority to use that
[1:45:36] power in the name of Jesus Christ every
[1:45:41] demon has to
[1:45:44] flee Samson where's your
[1:45:48] power just remember brother Ron when the
[1:45:50] enemy enemy comes and tries to throw you
[1:45:52] into a seizure and if you can think
[1:45:54] about it just go like this oh

[1:46:04] there he brought me through one that's
[1:46:08] one lock he'll bring me through another
[1:46:11] he'll bring me through another he
[1:46:13] brought you through the fire he brought
[1:46:15] you through the lightning he brought you
[1:46:17] through the snake bite he brought you
[1:46:20] through the stroke and the two or three
[1:46:22] heart

[1:46:46] something no matter how it looks or what
[1:46:50] kind of report this man may get in the
[1:46:53] future let me ask you a question whose
[1:46:56] report are you going to
[1:46:59] believe the Bible says he's already
[1:47:03] healed by his stripes he's already
[1:47:07] healed so you as a body of Believers no
[1:47:10] matter how dark it may get remember down
[1:47:13] inside there is
[1:47:17] light and you join your faith with his
[1:47:22] faith and then we'll ask God to give us
[1:47:24] his
[1:47:28] faith and then we'll march on the
[1:47:33] glory I had a brother he's Landing in a
[1:47:35] nursing home
[1:47:38] tonight he told me the other day at his
[1:47:41] house where he had to go to the nursing
[1:47:42] home he said brother Jason I asked my
[1:47:43] wife why don't God let me die I said
[1:47:46] buddy maybe God ain't done with you
[1:47:48] yet maybe there's there's one more
[1:47:51] person just one more I said the key is
[1:47:54] is are you ready should he call you he
[1:47:57] said I believe I'm ready I said then you
[1:47:59] ain't got nothing to worry
[1:48:01] about I said cuz if he don't hear you
[1:48:04] then in just a few moments you got he
[1:48:07] said I got a new body I said there you
[1:48:09] go but we're believing cuz we are
[1:48:12] believers God can still raise this man
[1:48:14] up out of the nursing home I don't know
[1:48:17] what God's plan is but I do know what
[1:48:19] his word
[1:48:21] says he allots a man 70
[1:48:27] years the prophet said and if Satan
[1:48:29] comes before then and tries to steal it
[1:48:32] you have a right to tell him to
[1:48:40] leave I say God grant us the faith to
[1:48:43] enact that quote and to believe it with
