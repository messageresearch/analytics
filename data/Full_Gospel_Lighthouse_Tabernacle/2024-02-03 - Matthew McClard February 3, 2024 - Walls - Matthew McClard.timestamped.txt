[51:31] chapter
[51:37] 2 sure good to be here Genesis Chapter
[51:40] 18 we're to pick up one verse there
[51:42] verse
[51:43] 14 I love this
[51:45] scripture is anything too hard for the
[51:50] Lord at the time appointed I'll return
[51:53] unto thee according to the time of thy
[51:54] life and sherah shall have a son
[51:58] Ephesians chapter 2 if you turn with me
[52:00] there we'll start reading verse
[52:06] 11 wherefore remember that ye being in
[52:10] times past Gentiles In the Flesh you're
[52:12] called uncircumcision by that which is
[52:14] called circumcision in the flesh made by
[52:16] hands that at that day you were without
[52:19] Christ being aliens from the
[52:20] Commonwealth of Israel strangers from
[52:23] the covenants of Promise having no hope
[52:25] and without God in the world but now how
[52:28] many say but now but now in Christ you
[52:31] were sometimes were're far off made nigh
[52:34] by the blood of Christ for he is our
[52:35] peace who has made both one and hath
[52:38] broken down the middle wall of partition
[52:40] between us having abolished in his flesh
[52:42] the enmity even the law of Commandments
[52:45] contained in the ordinances for to make
[52:47] of himself of Twain one new man so
[52:50] making peace that he might reconcile
[52:52] both unto God in one body by the cross
[52:55] having slain the imity thereby and came
[52:58] and preached peace to you which were a
[53:00] far off and to them that were nigh for
[53:02] through him we both have access by one
[53:04] Spirit unto the father now therefore you
[53:06] are no more strangers and foreigners but
[53:09] fellow citizens with the Saints of the
[53:10] household of God and are built upon the
[53:13] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[53:14] Jesus Christ himself being the Chief
[53:17] Cornerstone in whom all the building
[53:19] fitly framed together groweth un a holy
[53:22] Temple in the Lord and ye in whom ye
[53:25] also are builded together for in
[53:27] habitation of God through the spirit

[59:07] preach too much glory Lord have mercy
[59:10] sometime but there's one thing you'll
[59:11] never be able to DOD Doo overdo that's
[59:14] pray the Bible said I would all men pray
[59:17] everywhere lifting up holy
[59:19] hands he said you'll never be able to
[59:22] have too much fellowship with God

[59:30] that I know the thoughts with me does he
[59:34] know me yeah he knows you in fact he
[59:36] knew you from the foundation of the
[59:38] world and it ain't stopped him

[59:45] minute he knows all about you and he's
[59:47] still coming out who knocks at your
[59:49] heart in the morning who comes before
[59:51] you who won't leave you alone it's God
[59:54] God because he loves you would you love
[59:57] to have lived in that time and Great
[59:58] Fellowship God had with Adam and Eve in
[1:00:00] the garden to come down in the cool of
[1:00:02] the evening and talk with them and
[1:00:03] fellowship with them wouldn't that be
[1:00:04] marvelous we all would I can prove to
[1:00:07] you that he that we can come right back
[1:00:09] on those terms again with God right
[1:00:13] straight back in that kind of Fellowship
[1:00:17] I don't know about you I believe in that
[1:00:18] type of Fellowship I believe in a garden
[1:00:21] listen I'm not talking in the natural
[1:00:23] cuz we ain't living we're Liv Satan but
[1:00:25] there's a people that have entered into
[1:00:27] the holiest of holies with their God and
[1:00:29] they've come into perfect peace they've
[1:00:31] come into a place of perfect love
[1:00:32] they've come into Fellowship not just
[1:00:34] with another man but the man Christ
[1:00:36] Jesus and he begins to tell them he
[1:00:38] begins to talk to them he begins to show
[1:00:40] them the word and they begin to
[1:00:42] Fellowship around
[1:00:44] it I believe he wants to bless you
[1:00:46] tonight well how many wants a
[1:00:48] blessing yeah that's good we all should
[1:00:51] want a blessing
[1:00:53] amen I was telling brother Andrew about
[1:00:55] this I you know I I'm not an AI
[1:00:58] proponent but you know brother man makes
[1:00:59] the statement he said if you take the
[1:01:00] whole water of the earth and put it in a
[1:01:02] for foot pipe he said if you do it
[1:01:05] that's how and and blog it up that
[1:01:08] pressure behind there trying to leak
[1:01:10] through through every crevice that's how
[1:01:13] much God wants to bless
[1:01:15] you so I'm I'm a dummy but I said AI
[1:01:20] what is all the water of the Earth in a
[1:01:23] 4-ft pipe what's the calculation of
[1:01:25] pressure and
[1:01:27] it whoa I'm not that smart and I said
[1:01:31] Lord and so I grabb that I said now what
[1:01:33] would that do to a human body and it
[1:01:36] basically would obliterate it I mean it
[1:01:38] Crush bones It Crush
[1:01:41] everything but there's a people that's
[1:01:43] pressurized there's a people that's
[1:01:45] pressurized that can handle the fullness
[1:01:47] of God because all that he was he poured
[1:01:50] into Jesus but all that he is he's
[1:01:52] pouring into the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:01:54] Lord I want that kind of blessing maybe
[1:01:56] you need Deliverance tonight maybe
[1:01:58] you've been in a battle all week long
[1:01:59] but maybe this is your moment of taking
[1:02:01] a deep breath and a Time refreshing in
[1:02:03] the presence of God Almighty then why

[1:02:25] Satan does not want you to have that

[1:13:01] God doesn't say anything you know what
[1:13:02] the answer is there ain't nothing
[1:13:07] wrong I'm going to hit that a little bit
[1:13:08] harder just a

[1:13:34] on
[1:13:35] that you've got something to say to your
[1:13:37] brother or to your sister and he's
[1:13:39] trying to get you to reason it away that
[1:13:41] you're a nobody or nothing but the word
[1:13:43] that God gave you may be the very word
[1:13:46] that that person
[1:13:48] needs give me an example brother Matt
[1:13:50] when you have an itch do you tell your
[1:13:52] right hand to itch your left elbow no
[1:13:54] you do it that's what the body
[1:13:59] does think about it we are the very body
[1:14:02] of Jesus Christ if the body has a need
[1:14:05] over here I don't have to do it no the
[1:14:07] need begins to go right here and the
[1:14:09] mind of God tells this part of the body
[1:14:12] help that part of the body and it
[1:14:14] happens God wants to work through you
[1:14:17] don't let anything stop you from God
[1:14:20] working through
[1:14:22] you
[1:14:24] so here I am sitting there brother Brian
[1:14:27] Crow text me out of the blue hey buddy

[1:14:36] getting anywhere I might as
[1:14:38] well so I turn brother Samuel Browning
[1:14:40] on he begins to preach and he comes to a
[1:14:43] point there where he's talking about his
[1:14:46] anything too hard for the Lord and he
[1:14:48] said Abram and Sarah had a little tiff
[1:14:50] that morning I said he did so I sh
[1:14:53] Shamel Browning off and I went to is
[1:14:56] anything too hard for the
[1:14:58] Lord where am I sitting at I'm sitting
[1:15:01] in a place that I thought I'd done
[1:15:03] something
[1:15:07] wrong this is where I begin to read you
[1:15:10] know sometimes when things are going
[1:15:11] dark you know my nature it's the darkest
[1:15:13] just before
[1:15:16] day many times we see disastrous things
[1:15:18] happening like that especially to
[1:15:20] Believers we must bear this in mind that
[1:15:22] Satan is trying to block the blessing
[1:15:25] that's on the road let's catch this now
[1:15:28] that was very much so in this case Satan
[1:15:31] was trying to tempt them to feel they'd
[1:15:34] done
[1:15:36] wrong so here I am sitting in my living
[1:15:38] room in my rocking chair and I thought
[1:15:41] wait a minute it's Satan trying
[1:15:45] to and I got mad come on I thought i'
[1:15:48] sit here and let him rob a blessing from
[1:15:51] me day after after day after day and
[1:15:54] when it was revealed to me who it was
[1:15:56] that was doing it I realized you know
[1:15:58] what Satan I'm done with you I'm sick
[1:16:00] and tired of you I'm sick I'm so mad at
[1:16:04] you I'm going to fight you with

[1:16:09] Devil brother R said shamgar did he got
[1:16:12] mad at the Devil why because the devil
[1:16:14] would come down there and Rob his
[1:16:15] Blessing year after year after year well

[1:16:20] who you are you come straight from the
[1:16:22] pits of and you're lying to me and he's
[1:16:24] a good liar I felt every bit of it my
[1:16:27] condemnation temptation but when I
[1:16:29] recognized it was nothing but a
[1:16:33] lie I thought Lord I be to cry right
[1:16:37] there in my living room the spirit of
[1:16:38] Lord drop I said Lord I'll fight that
[1:16:40] thing with everything I got and I'm here
[1:16:42] to tell you if you feel like you've been
[1:16:44] tempted you've done something wrong and
[1:16:46] you prayed and you
[1:16:48] prayed and you prayed and nothing
[1:16:51] happens let me tell you you ain't done
[1:16:53] anything wrong that's nothing but a ling

[1:16:58] the pits of hell trying to rob a
[1:17:01] blessing well I'm here to tell you
[1:17:03] tonight you ain't going to limit the
[1:17:05] power of God any longer

[1:17:10] bride so I sat there and I said Lord God
[1:17:13] give me this message
[1:17:16] walls and that wall came tumbling down
[1:17:19] right there it isn't by chance brother
[1:17:23] Brian Crow text me and brother Samuel

[1:27:05] I can know you need help I can pray for
[1:27:07] you but it takes you to say father help
[1:27:11] me and once you do

[1:27:54] prayer I felt your presence moved Lord
[1:27:57] and I've wanted it but Lord I I just
[1:27:58] didn't know what to do well start with
[1:28:00] lifting your hands and take your hands
[1:28:03] off of it and surrender it to God and
[1:28:05] you watch your walls come
[1:28:15] down Elohim came and Elohim came with a
[1:28:21] message
[1:28:24] there's been a message coming the end
[1:28:26] time and it came to a woman to a
[1:28:29] specific woman he came and visited
[1:28:31] Abraham but he deserved the heart of
[1:28:35] Sarah he deserved the heart of Sarah and
[1:28:38] he was speaking to
[1:28:42] Sarah Elohim came to talk to you Elohim
[1:28:46] wants fellowship with you listen he
[1:28:48] don't want no tent wall between you he
[1:28:50] don't want your doubt in the way

[1:28:56] right how many's got a friend that's
[1:28:58] laughed at the message of
[1:29:00] God you don't write them
[1:29:05] off if they're one of his they're going
[1:29:07] to bring forth Christ you keep right on
[1:29:10] praying if there's breath in their body
[1:29:12] I don't care where God's got to bring
[1:29:13] them if there's breath in their body you
[1:29:15] keep pray that's the spirit of Jesus
[1:29:18] Christ that's perfect love but brother
[1:29:22] they are bad bad bad I don't care you
[1:29:24] are bad bad bad
[1:29:29] too I'm a firm believer I'm tired of
[1:29:33] fighting that's
[1:29:36] right I fought long enough over this
[1:29:38] that and the other I want a body to come
[1:29:41] together and let's
[1:29:45] move if God uses this vessel and he does
[1:29:47] that don't go look into that vessel that
[1:29:49] he's anything no he was just a thumb
[1:29:51] that day but God wants to you use you as
[1:29:53] a finger the next day come on listen SS
[1:29:55] of God get behind
[1:29:59] them Glory you love him
[1:30:03] amen he's
[1:30:05] appearing he's here
[1:30:07] tonight he saw fit to come by this way
[1:30:12] because he knew somebody needed to hear
[1:30:14] a word personal to them that don't let
[1:30:18] that doubt don't let the deadness of how
[1:30:21] you feel don't let how how your body
[1:30:23] looks and how how Abra don't look how
[1:30:26] there's no listen we try to limit what
[1:30:28] God can do Sarah was limiting what God
[1:30:30] can do but the very scripture was a
[1:30:32] rhetorical question when it asked it is
[1:30:34] anything too hard for the Lord and if
[1:30:37] something right now in your mind believe
[1:30:39] you think Lord that's too hard I I can't
[1:30:41] have that kind of blessing brother
[1:30:42] Andrew can have that blessing that
[1:30:43] brother can have that blessing but lord
[1:30:45] I can't have well that's a wall let's
[1:30:47] address it tonight say Lord I don't want
[1:30:49] that wall any longer I want the Liberty
[1:30:52] to believe all things are possible and
[1:30:54] not have a doubt not have a funny
[1:30:56] feeling but believe it with all my heart
[1:30:58] and receive
[1:31:02] it glory to
[1:31:05] God you love him

[1:32:38] thoughts oh my that could go on
[1:32:41] forever I'm pretty empty-headed maybe
[1:32:45] not brother matter I've made too many
[1:32:48] mistakes amen hogwash amen
[1:32:57] caught in the very Act of adultery
[1:32:59] thrown at the very feet of
[1:33:01] Jesus and right there he rewrote her
[1:33:05] story right there he rewrote her
[1:33:08] story how many give Witness by a show of
[1:33:11] hands how many has he rewrote your
[1:33:15] story how many's had that thought that

[1:33:22] devil God's grace is sufficient I'm
[1:33:25] still here tonight I maybe didn't feel
[1:33:27] like I could be here there's been many
[1:33:29] times I've wanted to quit but you know
[1:33:30] what I'm still here tonight and while
[1:33:32] I'm here I might as well give him praise
[1:33:34] in the house of God I might as well
[1:33:36] worship Him and the same God that
[1:33:37] started that work is the same God that's
[1:33:39] going to complete that work how's he
[1:33:41] going to do it brother Matt little by
[1:33:43] little he will do it in your life and
[1:33:45] I'm a very example of the little by
[1:33:47] little but I'm not stopping there my
[1:33:49] expectation is higher
[1:33:53] my expectation is higher set your
[1:33:55] expectation higher don't get satisfied
[1:33:58] because the devil will wall you in right
[1:34:06] there here's another thought you can't
[1:34:09] have the Holy
[1:34:13] Ghost all right somebody's never had
[1:34:15] that
[1:34:17] thought not
[1:34:20] you
[1:34:22] not you can come up this far but and
[1:34:25] then all of a sudden you recognize what
[1:34:27] that is that's a lying Spirit from the
[1:34:30] straight from the pits of hell you
[1:34:31] realize he's right here right now trying
[1:34:33] to rob you of a blessing he's right here
[1:34:35] right now trying to tell you brother mat

[1:34:45] in prayer we've already touched it so in
[1:34:48] my mind it's as good as
[1:34:50] done
[1:34:53] I believe right now people are already
[1:34:55] being changed I believe in the power of
[1:34:57] the word the power of the spoken word as
[1:34:59] the word of God goes forth and you come
[1:35:01] to church how many feels better than
[1:35:02] what they came in how many was
[1:35:05] tired well you've just come under the
[1:35:07] stimulation of the revelation of the
[1:35:08] word and it makes you a little bit happy
[1:35:11] and it makes you feel a little free and
[1:35:12] it makes you want to dance and it makes
[1:35:14] you want to shout yes it does why don't
[1:35:15] you preachers get it and maybe you'll
[1:35:17] understand what we're
[1:35:20] doing
[1:35:24] boo devil back off of
[1:35:28] us well brother Matt you said we need
[1:35:30] them yes we do need them we need him to
[1:35:33] preach the message of the
[1:35:40] hour here's another one see he doesn't

[1:35:53] do yes he
[1:35:56] does yes he does I'll give you an
[1:35:59] example I was in a mall with my wife we
