[Applause] [Music] whether Roger received a real miracle from the Lord it's such a privilege to have you here and sister and we thank you for keeping him straight for the last a little bit and so we just certainly love love this I'd like to share some victories with you this this even our pastor is feeling a lot better today so so for the last last couple weeks brother on has been it's been spitting up different things and and brother on he'd seen these things and he immediately thought that they were the lesions maybe in his chest or whatnot so so they he was able to catch one today and so as soon as that happened today they they did a chest x-ray and so from what I understand his last chest x-ray was on February the 20th and then they took one a day and they said that they said today from the last x-ray to this x-ray that things have improved significantly I said we can't explain those things but we can we can oh yeah we're feeding these buzzards of cancer to the pigs one at a time a man and so they they scheduled an MRI on brother on at 2:00 o'clock today and so the doctors the doctors came in and read it and the surgery did its job and his scan was the scan was perfect and so they said there's just a spot of blood there or where they did the surgery at and said there's nothing to be concerned with there but we know that this is a marathon this is not a sprint so we want to point to you these victories that these are huge victories these are huge victories and so we're just very thankful we'll take we'll take the little slightest liver sliver of a victory at any moment because we know that these things are of God and we're just expecting nothing but full victory but in all of this process you keep your eyes on the Word of God no matter if you get good news or bad news you keep your eyes on the world and we won't get caught up in the delay of time and things we'll just we'll receive it as God gives it to us I like I'd like to share this with you tonight I've asked the brothers if they could play this clip of this sermon brother on preached a few years back in sister Ana was so and to share it with us today I'd actually had actually told our pastor to go and listen to this sermon that he had preached a few years ago Satan you can't take his life and so if the brothers could do that for us this evening and I would like to share that with you it's that okay man god bless you if you could hit the lights for us there and make a declaration Satan you can't take his life before I read my scriptures I just want to just share a couple of words with you if I could if I could just if you just give me just a moment there are no miracles without messes no miracles without great trials no miracles without dark hours let me just share a couple with you Sarah endured 90 years of frustrating humiliation of barrenness before a miracle baby Moses was leading them to million slaves to their slaughter at the hands of Pharaoh and his chariots before the Red Sea open and allowed him to pass through on dry ground thousands of people grew tired and weary before Jesus multiplied fish and bread enough for every one of them to feast a widow and her son had to be starving to death ahead of an unlimited bent bin of flour and an unending horrible daniel had to be thrown in the lion's den before he could be spared from even a scratch Shadrach Meshach and Abednego were thrown into the furnace prior to being protected so they completely could be saved by the son of God and no one could even smell the smoke on them bartimaeus had to experience a lifetime of blindness prior to experience the great physicians Healing Touch Jesus would have never had to free the man of them the tombs which called Legion of demons if the man had not been demonized in the first place then lepers had not had to experience leprosy before experiencing the miracle of their healing Peter had to go to prison before the angel the Lord would unlock his chains and set him free had to die before he could raise from the dead I stand here as a witness to not I could have been burned up my lungs could have collapsed burned 75% and they could be literally deteriorating even tonight I could have died and my harvesters my look my organs be harvested I could be paralyzed tonight from my neck down because they said I'd never walk again I could have succumbed to a lightning bolt snake bucks heart attacks strokes those are just a few of the trials that I have been through but I want to stand here tonight and declare before living witnesses that Jesus Christ is still in the building [Applause] I stand here not as a novice reading youth poetry or trying to tickle your ear I stand here commissioned by the word of the Living God to cut the devil's head off at every corner here this afternoon amen so if you'll turn with me in your scriptures tonight to John chapter 12 I believe he's I believe we're in for a wonderful night don't you John chapter 12 and verse 1 Satan behold he is in thy hand but save his life you know how much how much Satan hates to hear this rant across the pulpit you know how much Satan hates to hear this read it's your home in your Bible studies do you know how many nightmares that he has been given that he unleashed everything that he could against a man he unleashed the greatest trial that you could ever be given to a human being and get all of and in all of that releasing of all of that trouble on top of a man that man caught a revelation with God and what's that revelation became a reality in his love that's not a devil in hell that could shake him from the promises of God the prophet of God Satan Satan may ping you in a corner without with cancer God will make a way of escape [Applause] amen to me I receive that as prophecy that Satan you can't take his life staying with us this evening I believe as as Peter said we're going to receive the end of our faith we're going to receive the things that we expect a man let's sing this song tonight our possible if you [Music] Oh Oh little things are possible [Music] suss is he oh gee is a all things are possible oh Jesus Missy it's a oh Jesus all things are possible Jesus is here father we know that all things are possible because you are here and Lord Jesus we know that we as your people we are expecting the supernatural but before the supernatural can ever take place in our lives the presence of God is essential and Lord Jesus we know that you have gathered here tonight Lord with your children because you are told us that you would be here and father that's what we are relying upon not upon our feelings not upon sensations not upon emotions but we are relying upon the God that that moves and energizes our faith to reach out into that realm father and to see the things of God and make them possible in front of our eyes now father you see every hand that's went up you see every prayer request already see brother Seth in the in the ER just now chest x-rays Andy Katie's father things that are going on I pray the same pillar of fire that is here tonight would be in that hospital room just now and I pray that you are dismissed or to his vessel Lord he has been buffeted by a messenger of Satan and I pray father that the angel the Lord would stand against this messenger of Satan and defeat him in Jesus name father every prayer request every need father we present them to you and we pray that you take complete and supreme control father's award goes forth I pray that you'd mend the broken heart men relationships mend our hearts to your word father and bond us together with your three cold they three cord of of love father and pond us together like never before Lord with your spirit with your word draw us closer to you we pray in the name of Jesus Christ we lift the banner of our Lord and say that you're here and that you're moving Lord go to the hospital room of our pastor and do the miraculous father we see father even the results of our prayers last night today so father may we continue in prayer and continue in faith Lord may you minister to us may we not be so just focused in on one thing that we miss the little things father Lord I pray to you and minister to the little child I pray you minister to the old tonight we pray you have your way in the service and will be careful to serve you and give you all the glory and honor in Christ's name we pray amen if you have your Bibles tonight we'll look over in the book of Acts chapter 2 verse 1 through 4 and then to 2nd Peter chapter 1 and verse 21 and we'd like to continue our thought on God is with us and we will see miracles and just a little sideline thought on the same wind is passing through this place the same wind of the Holy Ghost is moving I believe that tonight with all that is within me that the Holy Ghost is here to meet every single one of our needs do you believe that tonight the Bible tells us blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord I'd say you're blessed tonight can you raise your hand and say you're blessed tonight a man Acts chapter 2 and verse 1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they appeared unto them there and there appeared unto them cloven tongues as of a fire and it set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance 2nd Peter chapter 1 and verse 21 for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord acts 2 and 2 says and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting at I pray that that same wind of the Holy Ghost comes into this building tonight and UBA again to you begin to feel the breeze of the Holy Ghost as he slips over your soul as we see here as in 2nd Peter chapter 1 that we realized that that the prophecy of God was not given by the will of man but it came it came by the will of God as they were moved by the Holy Ghost and and we realized that these men were influenced and inspired by God - to speak the things of God they were they were moved to speak to prophesy though it may have been time that there would have been a time of delay were able to watch that word being a prophet they were able to watch that word and see when it was coming to its spot and maybe it maybe it seemed like it was never going to come but yet that word had to come to materialisation because it was not them speaking you see God didn't allow them to just speak of their own accord but God speak his word and that we realized that that surely our God will do nothing unless he reveals himself to his servants the prophets and we see that these men of God they would speak the word as the wind of a breath would inspire them to speak and they would come to the generation that they were allotted to come to and they would they would speak the things of God and they would they would watch those things materialize and you can look all the way back into the Old Testament and you can see how that how the prophecy was rolling there and and there were men like Isaiah and men like Elisha that maybe there were prophecies that came forth that maybe they didn't necessarily see right in front of them but yet the prophecy was still hanging there and tonight to realize that there's prophecy that's hanging over top of you as individuals that those things that are going to come to pass there's there's earth there's that he is the Lord our God that heals us there's a promise that's hanging over you he said that he would bless you coming in and going out he said that he would make you the head and not the tail he said that he would put you above and not beneath those promises that are hanging over top of you and a lot of times there's an enemy that's standing there in the gap or in a block as it were and he's trying to keep that promise from getting to you but I want to assure you as the people of God that no matter the attack no matter what you go through no matter the oppression there is a promise there and if God has a promise that is intended for you as an individual it's got to come to materialisation you see that promise is more real than you are tonight are you with me tonight that promise is more real than than you are tonight and your faith can reach out and say that that promise that's hanging there for me I receive that in the name of the Lord I receive that for myself I receive that for my household I receive that for my life I receive that for my marriage I receive that for my children we display that token and we express that token that this is none other than the life of Jesus Christ in this day and we watch that prophecy as it is inspired by men of God as we watch it as it begins to roll and let it just roll by your way tonight as I speak tonight maybe you're not maybe maybe you're catching up to where I am but I'm asking you as as believers tonight to say amen to the word and and to believe the word and let that prophecy roll right over top of your situations roll right over to roll right over top of your unbelief and let that word a prophecy squash your unbelief are you with me tonight now brother madam said that each generation has its own revival it has a chance at the Word of God so I'll look out upon you and you are a generation of people that that you have a fresh chance at the word tonight young people I want you to hear me I hope you listening right well that this is your opportunity you've got a chance to receive in this generation this revival this were this promise this message brother Adam said it and it's got to come that every generation all the way from Reagan all the way to little Isaac all the ways got a chance at the word now Satan's tried to steal that chance away from you he's tried to stuff all kinds of things down and your throat and down into your soul to keep you from getting through that and he's tried to block you with all types of different things to keep you from getting through the word he's put sin in your life he's put cigarettes in your life he's put troubles in your life but you still got a chance at the word you still got a chance at the word and you may have fallen in life but get back up he's a god of first chances he's a God of second chances he's the god of many chances you get back up you ain't gotta worry about if God's gonna be there he's as sure as his word tonight then you'll never leave yeah he'll never forsake you they'll be with you even India to the end of the world hello somebody your friends may leave you your people may leave ya circumstances may change home situations may change the guarding never failed you can look through the time-space and you can look there was prophecy and that was hanging there but they're politically responds that came and they tried to destroy the Word of God but it never worked there was kingdoms had tried to stop the move of God but it never worked why because God's Word will always come to pass they became to pass in those circumstances of the Old Testament what about you and I when we sat here under a blood covenant with a token over our lives filled with a baptism of the Holy Ghost that God's not some way far off up in heaven but deities living on the inside of you and deity is bringing that promise to pass it's bringing it to pass hallelujah opposition's trying to knock us down suffering tried to knock us down but the word still remained God is God he's a God that don't give up he's a God that don't back down and for God's on my side I'm gonna go all the way with Jesus we used to sing that song is a choir I'm going all the way I'm going with Jesus all the way you remember it's all I'm going with Jesus all the way well actually troops tonight it's been a while since we sung it but I want you to know it's a testament in my soul that I'm doing Jesus all the way he made not high Satan may knock me down but I'm going Jesus all the way he may try to afflict me but I'm still going Jesus all the way he may try to turn me but I'm going Jesus all the way for sickness I'm going with Jesus through Tom oh I'm golfing with Jesus there's a god that god of a force Burt you may not feel it but he's away maker he's behind this water with all of his strength he's behind it full force tonight and he's going to bring it to pass but will you allow him to bring it to pass will you allow him to move well we look over in the book of Genesis chapter 2 and verse 7 and the Bible tells us that the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became and man became a living soul you can imagine as the prophet of the Lord would show us show us of this in an even he would describe it in such major detail as he would watch Adam and Eve as they were walking through the garden as he would as Adam would walk down through there and he would begin to spit off the names of animals that he had that he had the the ability to name because God gave him that ability he was able to name it because you see he'd watch that character of that horse that he was a beast of power and he taught it a horse and he and he's seen the characteristics of a lion and a lamb and he named all these things according to their characteristics he could tell her now I've named this arose I've named this allele he and you see these things were these things were characterized by their life and Adam was able as the son of God as an amateur God to turistic and see the life of that animal see the life of that plan see the life behind it and he named it so if you as a son of God can look at the character of a demon of melanoma you realize the character of it and you know where it came from are you with me we realize that we are facing the time but as sons of God we realize the expression of that demon of cancer is coming from a source oh if you could trace back the source just now you can allow the wind of the Holy Ghost to go into that realm and burn it out you see the enemy would love to put jealousy up on top of you and some of me has some of you are so jealous that you're afraid to walk out of the building because you're afraid that somebody's going to steal your a wife or steal your husband but if you can allow the Holy Ghost to go into that channel and begin to allow him to move he can burn all those things out of you you don't have to deal with those things but you watch Adam as he's as he's dealing with these things you see something was moving him to name them something was moving him to express these things and this he's walking down for the guard and as he's watching and he's looking and Eve all of a sudden the wind begins to brood and it begins to move through the Garden of Eden and he just got done putting the curves in her head and all of a sudden the wind starts blowing it like she's got a head snuck out of a corner and he said Adam I just don't like it that way and Adam says it's no problem I can control that for you I've got that for you and he just speaks and the wind turns and goes the other direction he begins to say now look on the other side of that mountain is a beautiful river and on and that river just flows and the water is so gentle it's so perfect he said well I can't see it from here and these birds speak and he have the ability to move a mountain if there was a tree in his way he was able to move that tree just to fit his vision of what he wanted to see now there are things that are standing in front of you that is blocked that's fish in a few but there's a pride that will remove those hangs out of God's fish if you will a little the same wind of the Holy Ghost that comes slipping through your Avenue just now he'll take the tear he will take a bulldozer the Holy Ghost and come through your tin can alley he'll move those that are blocking you from getting to Jesus that are blocking you from being the perfect picture of what Jesus has saw of you before the foundation of the world glory he was a God on earth he was an amateur God but we know through the fall and for reasoning powers that Adam lost his Dominion he lost his Dominion he lost his sonship but don't you be disturbed by that before Adam ever fail there was a lamb that had redeemed him before the foundation of the world you see because Obama has told us that those who he for no Vimy also called and for God to allow fellowship he allowed the sacrifice of a lamb to redeem them the lamb was provided for album Adam because he had already and his nostrils became the breath of eternal life of God and he become a living soul he was a son of God he had power like God he was an amateur God you can imagine how Adam felt walking out of the garden you can imagine how he walks out of the garden but he realizes that he's walking out with a promise hanging over top of him he's walking out realizing a little walk in that again they have fallen from the spot where you knew that you should have been walking but you can walk in that spot again you can raise back up to that spot again this helps in in my life and it knocked me down you can walk in that spot again are you with me tonight Church you may have been knocked down in your mind or looked at the road things set their own things maybe maybe your temper got the best of you but you can walk in that spot of the Sun again whoo hallelujah but he realizes he's he's walking out that there's a promise of one that is coming when God was speaking to the serpent and it tells him that I will put enmity between thee and the woman see you see God was telling him that there's one common there's one common you may have been able to trick Eve but you will not be able to trick this set it out and neither will you be able to trick the second Eve you see what Eve turned down we except now it was what's the anointed man now the anointed bride what are you anointed with the same anointing power with the same Holy Ghost with the same wind that fell in the day of Pentecost [Music] [Applause] and as you watch says who watch as that second Adam came on a scene he controlled the atmosphere he control demons he controlled the winds he controlled the atoms he controlled the waves what have we seen in this thing what have we seen in this day when a man when the Prophet was on Colorado Mountain what we've seen in this day and he controlled the storms and he controlled the winds what is it selling you as the Church of the Living God at the same wind he's blowing on the inside of your soul prophet said in things that are to be it was easy for those Jews who had been taught for generations to believe that there was a great supernatural God but to think that God had come down and was manifesting himself to the person of a son Jesus Christ God and tabernacled in the body of flesh that was a little too much for them to understand you see it because the Bible had told us that the Word was made flesh and would dwell amongst us and that's exactly what had happened you see when God came in the form of his son Jesus he was God manifested in the body of flesh that light that no man could approach was manifested in the body of flesh the God that no man was permitted to see at any time was merited and manifested in the flesh the pillar of fire was manifested in the flesh the pillar of cloud that would keep them caught at bay was manifested in the flesh the God of Israel was now manifested in the flesh the god of the prophets was now manifested in the flesh the holy God of sinful people was now manifested in the flesh and the fullness of the Godhead was now manifested in bodily in the flesh in Christ Jesus and what did the scripture tell us that he is Emmanuel God with us was now manifested in the flesh it was God in morphe he was masking himself in the pillar fire masking himself in a man called Jesus now he's masking himself in a body it's God with us God above us and God in us it's the continent sending God all the way down throughout eternity and here this God was in human flesh it was a little too hard for them to understand that this God was now living in a body and Nicodemus being a secret believer he watched these things he watched the actions of this man called Jesus he watched how he acted he watched how he performed miracles and Nicodemus came to a nighttime because he was afraid that he would get kicked out of his organization and he came to him and he told him he said master we know that thou art a teacher that's come from God for no man can do these works unless God be with him he was telling him that I realized that the God of Abraham is with you the miracles that I see that I perform in brother arts way rather our brother Doug heal rather held in Frazier I realize that there's a God and no man can do these things except God be with you see for us sometimes we get caught up we get caught up a lot of times we get accustomed to miracles we get accustomed to the supernatural and a lot of times you'll set right there and think well that's just another miracle that's not just another miracle that was God and a lot of times you just brush it off and how I realized I realized that there was a testimony that just came forth from brother Archer that was a miracle but some of you thought well I didn't see Claude and app say sister and was looking at God that day that that was God to me I saw God today in the body of Ron Spitzer I saw God today what I see him and I saw me myself I saw him in you we should never be accustomed to the things of God that these things are supernatural he said well I just don't see it do you realize for you to be here today is a miracle you should never get accustomed to it's just another day you have been granted a 24-hour slot of time that you do with it man alive can you unlock most telling you I am giving you this time to go out and do what you want to with it and I'm still gonna pay oh my I hope you hear me preaching to you tonight you got 24 hours to give God all the praise and still get blessed spots you got 24 hours to live your life and such a spot that you overcome every demon of hell that's a miracle well I can't get my hair done in time I had to brush 14 pairs of teeth today because that's how many children I got maybe you shouldn't have had 14 children if all you're gonna do is complain because you miss seeing God and all other things that he's done for you 24 hours and in that 24 hours I choose to pray like never before I choose to worship like never before aren't so much in a preaching mode that I'm even going to preaching in my sleep just ask my life she just got right behind me it's are they mad at me last night while I was preaching I say you need to write this stuff down what is it it's where we're living at oh my you know how the enemy loves to come and tour meet you in the night time because you see comes to you when you're not on your god as it were and he affects your subconscious and you have a nightmare and Satan afflicts your whole day because of that I say oh god I pray you seal us where the Holy Ghost that you'll protect our dreams and that we will not be affected by Satan's nightmare but we will become Satan's nightmare the pray that were so filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that when the enemy looks at us he starts running for cover what is it he's witness that win before an attack defeated before four gospel lighthouse this same wind is in the building and it will defeat Satan any time any place under any situation this is God [Applause] Nicodemus he was not accustomed to seeing these things hey how do I get this how do I get this power and Jesus said unless you be born again you cannot understand the things of God but because you're not born again you'll not be able to understand it but you see to those it seems so elementary to you to do that have been born again but you realize how big it was when you wasn't born again and you see sometimes we get caught up we'll get born again but you see let's allow them to look at the god that's in front of him and receive that God and worship that God and becoming in such an experience with that God like never before don't just put it off where you just need to be born again what you need to do is just die out you need to die out to yourself and we don't need to push these things off this is the ultimate right here because jesus said you must be born again I didn't see I didn't see where there's any room for excuse right there or any room for interpretation he said you must and if Jesus said you must well I'm gonna take Jesus at his word so what am I going to do to you I'm going to preach to you that you must be born again to understand the things of God they seen these things before but they were captivated and disturbed by this man called Jesus John chapter 3 in verse 6 Jesus said that was his born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hears the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the Spirit you see you can judge the wind by its effects wind is a very powerful thing you look out upon the landscape of the earth and you will you realize and see how powerful the wind is how that it changes mountaintops and how it blows across that mountain in it and it shaves it it shaves it in such a spot wind is so powerful that it breaks trees wind is so powerful that it moves desert mountains and it blows the sand the grain of sand and it blows in and it forms new mountains and new valleys because when does that powerful wind changes the systems of weather in the sky wind will move anything that ain't tied down and wind will even change your course are you with me you've been letting loose some summer semesters eh yeah I can feel them I can feel that you're throwing mustard seeds to the mountain but let a win get behind it let them win get behind that grain of mustard seed and watch what it'll do window change your course you can imagine this if you're out running jogging for your exercise yeah I know yeah I know it's a tough subject here but we'll get over it you're on it you can imagine you're running out in the wind maybe it give you a better illustration so you ain't gotta think about running but you look out you can look at all the weatherman fails and that's standing out pairing that gale-force winds and they're trying to act like it's blowing them back and forth and you got people walking behind them it's just walking normal but you can really imagine if you're sitting there in that 120 mile blowing against you and he's pushing you and you're struggling just to move forward you see it's a wind that it'll make you change your course and turn around and start going the other way well I got good news for you that same wind of the Holy Ghost is making safe can change his course and make him turn around and run for cover it's pushed it against the enemy the wind will change its course you look at the wind and you see the effects of it but you don't see the land you don't know where it comes from but it's there you look at the leaves and as they're clapping when the wind goes across them but you don't see the wind you see the trees battling but you don't see the wind you see i last things are moving because of the wind but you don't see the wind there are things that are happening just now that you are realizing the effect of it but you don't see the spirit the Holy Ghost is here is moving and in shaping people's lives by the word of power maybe you don't see it but I see the effects of it I see the effects of it on your marriage I see the effects of it on your children I see the effects of the Holy Ghost and no man can do these things except he be from God you don't see it but the winds there you may not sense it but the operation of the Holy Spirit said man can create this man can't do this but God can there's been things that are sitting here in this church that you've been praying about and the Spirit of the Lord moved to porn you didn't see him working but he was working you didn't see him moving but he was moving I'd say that there was a shift after Melchizedek came after milk Ezzor that came and Abraham is Harry say Hillary they looked at they looked at milk esident and all of a sudden there became a shift over their body and it brought their body into a spot of subjection where the water could come forth there was a word hanging over top of them that had to come forth they didn't see maybe when they went to bed that night but when they woke up the next morning they seen the effect of milk as a net the charts wort ain't been able to look at it but you have been able than my place and by access to look at the effects of melchizedek you watch the effects of the wind of the Holy Ghost when men that were once sinful become holy they're thoughtlessly become serious evil become pure fish has become moral moral become religious prayer has become prayerful rebellious and stubborn become meek mild and gentle no man could do that somebody may influence you to be on a better diet than the crispy dream died let yourself drive around it as a pastor would say 13 times and you'll be influenced together are you with me you see man can influence and maybe affect you in a sense but no man can change you but God you see because Peter would walk with the Lord he would become influenced by the Lord he B would walk with him and he would he would do the things of God he would see the things of God and Peter would give up his business efficient he would walk with Jesus he walked closer than anybody could imagine he was influenced by him he went out and did and preached but when Jesus died what did Peter do he went back to his old business again Peter had enough he had enough fight for you and I rely he had a no fight for a whole whole apostles he was still influenced by that first nature but when he was up there in the upper room they began to be a wind of change and begin to change his circumstance to change how he viewed everything he didn't just turn a new leaf he became a new creation in Christ he was afraid to come out of the Upper Room there he was afraid to speak but when the day of Pentecost was fully come and they were there all in one Accord he come out of that Upper Room shall he come out of that Upper Room dance and he came out of that upper room praising God and speaking with the heavenly language I'd say that he was influenced by an angel he come out speaking this as that which was prophesied by the Prophet Joel brother Branham said in blasphemous names he said the church is the mystical body of Christ born of the breath of God he said or did you get it born of the breath of God God breathed breathed into the nostrils spiritually of Adam and it became a living soul did you know that the Pentecost or the true Pentecostal church is born of the breath of God John says in John the Bible says in John chapter 20 said unto them peace be unto you me even so I sinned you and when he had said he briefed on them they saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost you see this was a promise that he gave them that he breathed on them the promise and said receive ye the Holy Ghost it was a promise but they went up there in the upper room to wait for the promise to be fulfilled there's a promise hanging over you just like the same thing is when we lay hands on the sick lay heads upon you to be healed then you go to this and you're waiting for the promise to be fulfilled you may not feel you may not feel any different but the winds of change are moving over your body you remember when the Prophet was just a little child and it was there and it became awareness that totally set his course you remember how that whirlwind was caught in that tree and he was he was walking down there carrying that bucket of water you remember and he stood there and that wind span there and a voice spoke out of that wind and he told him don't ever smoke or drink or defy your body for there's a word for you to do some people I tend to put that on the prophet that's you don't defy your body don't take a strong drink don't smoke don't defy your body don't tak to yourself for the things of the world you got a lot to do there's a voice behind this wind that's correct in the air you remember when brother Branham was standing there in 1950 and he's standing there to Houston policy and there in Houston Texas and he's standing there and there's a debate between on divine healing between doctor best and brother Bosworth and he's there and all of these things are going over and you know the story and brother Branham was sitting at the top of the balcony the Bosworth said now I know but the bills here in the building and he said I'm ace and now whether he wants to come or not that's up to him but he said I know he's in the building somewhere and he said if he would like to come and close in a word of prayer or say a few things he can come and make his way this way and his brother Howard was sitting there and he said Bo don't move he said I'm not moving he said Ben all of a sudden they're beginning to be a wind over top of him and a word and he stood up they said let's stand he said I stood up and Howard said Beale sit down he said Howard he's spoken brother Branham walks down me walks down the aisle that is set in a course and angels are guarding that aisle as the Prophet is making his way to the stage and brother Branham takes the platform and he starts speaking to those thousands of people and he says I'm sorry that these things have to be I'm sorry that these things have to be like this and all of a sudden there came a whirl again and a wind over top of brother Branham and he said he has spoken he has spoken and all of a sudden the photographer that was sitting there snapped a picture and it proved to you that this message is vindicated none other than by our Lord Jesus Christ I have seen that same vilify come in this building how many church services and influence of people to believe for their Possible's hallelujah the vision don't make you whole the vision tells you that there's a God here oh ma Oh what about you tonight what about you sitting there in that condition why don't you let the wind of the Holy Ghost begin to brood over top of you and change your situation we've been sitting there long enough in that condition you've been sitting there putting up of those Saints for long enough it's a time that the wind of the Holy Ghost starts moving it's a time that mom and daddy says enough enough it's time that young people says enough is enough I'm now allowing the Holy Ghost to move in this life and speak in my heart and move on my soul and change my situation if the natural wind can break a tree what about your nature when the Holy Ghost comes across you are you with me you're a candidate for his presence when you open up your soul and you say Almighty God I'm here in your name I'm worshiping your name I'm believing in your name and I'm receiving it in your name forgive me my sins move away these doubts move away my fears you're a candidate for his presence and I want to tell you that the Angels the Lord are here with a purpose in mind to move you in to change your life change the situation they've gathered here tonight to move you into his presence not in the presence of angels but in the presence of the Shekinah glory would you believe me a night if I told you that he's here some of you believe it some of you don't but he's here the same wind of the Holy Ghost is here you remember when brother Manny was standing there 1958 preached in the oneness of unity and he's standing there and he's challenging the people to believe brother Branham starts reading here sigh excuse me he starts praying and he says I'm now telling the devil to a debate and he comes down through there and he's challenging this enemy and his challenging the people's faith to believe he is challenging them to believe he's class in the life of Satan a scottson his demonic power and all of a sudden there came a wind from another realm but the ban of says did you hear that did you hear that that's God speaking to you that's God speaking to you I say to you Church of the Living God God speaking to you he said would you come out of Babylon your voice is his voice what you separate from saying this is your message this message income educates you into this this message then come to teach you some new theology or create a new church this message came to a people that believe this message came to produce Jesus Christ there's some people they don't want it and some people they love staining their sin there's some people they love staying in jealousy there's some people that love staying in fear why because they're in love with it come on somebody you're in love with that demon if you'd only wake up and realize that you are in love with a spawn off for Satan shake yourself Samson shake yourself shake yourself up out of it not falling over the demon fall in love with Jesus [Music] he's here to heal he's here to save he's here to move he's here to breathe Oh breathe on us Oh breathe on us whoo following us Almighty God Oh change I situation are you with me if he don't come some of you gonna live in that condition we will stay in that condition oh I wonder I want to fish somebody is they ain't got strength enough to get out of it ain't got strength enough to break them prison bars but I want you to know if you just lift your hand to him if you just lift your hand to him and say I can't get out of it I want you to know there's a man that's stronger than all the prison bars of Satan stronger than sickness stronger than sin stronger than worry stronger than doubt he's able and he's give us with the mission had a brand of Jesus Christ the safe house a hail give way in the name of Jesus Christ let him loose loose loose [Applause] the articles begin the road [Music] that shakes and strap to keep you there and enslave you and make you think you're not strong enough I say to you by one little answer your faith is greater than Satan you believe that brother Jeffrey one little answer your faith is greater than Satan for the Bible says greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world he's greater than cancer he's greater than torment he's greater than jealousy he's greater than fear he's greater than your habits he's greater than your trouble he's greater than depressant his blade Hermon snake must he's plated in complexes he's greater he's greater than death he overcame death it's later than hail hail became hail the angels are here to move you it was at the midnight hour that the tale was Carlos let it cut loose you referred the midnight cry come out of her my people [Applause] that same wind is powerful enough to destroy your demons we believe that I'm not gonna give it to you unless you totally believe it I'm a bridge to you Tori there's a wind that's stronger there's a wind that's a destroyer yeah there's a wind that's a conqueror there's a winner there's a wind that's an overcomer there's a wind that our destroy the demons of Hell you believe that there's a wind that's greater than cancer there's a wind that's greater than torment there's a wind that's greater than bareness has a wind that's greater than all kinds of things and so and that's a destroyer because you look over in the book of Exodus chapter 15 and when Moses starts singing a song of deliverance he says the winds you blow with your winds and you covered up our enemies with the sea that wind of the Holy Ghost has a blood that's attached to him and it's so strong that he'll restore your sin it's so strong that it can't even remember what you did yesterday now you hear me it's greater than what you did yesterday hallelujah glory be to God it's greater it's greater than your filthy habits I'm gonna tell you something that will blow your way it's greater than you he said oh no I don't see him working let me tell you he's here he's here he's here I'm not gonna believe any how I did for you and you look at all these hands you look at all these believers they said that's for me that's for me that's for me that wind comes and it changes the seasons all the way we just moved in this ring and it changes the season from straw to winner to spring in the summer I tell you by the name of the Lord there's a wind that's changing the season he Saints in a season of torment it's changing the season of oppression that we're changing it I say that there's a wind of change is blowing through this place it been on my heart all week that this is nothing but a messenger of Satan that's tried to give us blow after blow after blow after blow after blow but that's an angel here as an angel moving as an angel even as an angel speakin he's greater than a messenger Satan I'm not some bot he's here he's movement he's changing he's acting reach out and touch it [Music] we've been asking for peace reach out and touch it even ask you for a change let the wind move let that wind move let that wind move let that wind move come on somebody when's it gonna be a time that sons and daughters of God realize that position realize that this wind he's he'll remove you that's the force put Israel in our place he put her in a homeland but national force they putting a bride in her place it is none other than the power of God that is putting the bride in her position by the same word by the same power of authority it's putting herself in her position as the bride of Jesus Christ I'd say Goliath was willing he was sitting there and he was watching and he looked like he was just another little boy he look like he was just another boy but I'd say that David was swinging in that swing he was swinging it with such force that collide to fill the wind off her I want you to hear me Goliath of cancer well swing it with everything that's within us let you feel the wind but the Holy Ghost attacking you this is an a the Giants fall [Music] ah we went for every age to message us and they were anointed to come they were anointed in their season with the wrench word of God to attract the attention of the seed in their day out and pulled him out but now we are in the season we went for the season of Elijah coming and a large internee he was turning your hearts back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers we went through that day we're living in that day and now it is the season of rapture hallelujah the winds gonna blow you and pick you up it's gonna pick you up one of these mornings between 6:00 and 9:00 and out wind and the Holy Ghost is gonna slip past you you may feel a cool breeze slip past your backside and pick you up and all of a sudden you can see mama from walking down the door I say the wind of change is coming and it's moving up people towards a body change there has to be a season of faith with the wind of the Holy Ghost moves us into a realm to believe for that to accept that why not tonight why not tomorrow did you date tomorrow it won't be the next day I'm gonna live like it's right now brother burn up sit in the second seal he said if I knew that the Lord was coming in the morning I'd still be here preaching to you this second seal Alleluia I know is coming taste right on top he's right on top he's right on top Alleluia one day I'm gonna take the snap I'm gonna take a half a step that way they're gonna take a half a step this way and we shop it so if he was God and Daniel said he surely is God right now stored if he could come and change the three Hebrew children have you change their circumstance change their situation how much more can the son of man step in your situation I'd say there's plenty of room in this fire for the fourth man [Applause] [Music] whether on there's plenty of room for the fourth man in that hospital room as plenty room for [Music] we may have to bust up the walls we may have had on this Turks that I say there's plenty of room here for all our products has plenty of room here come on I love what's bring you back in the name of Jesus [Music] Oh [Music] I want to tell you as a church your faith I can come to this pulpit time and time again but every single time I get here your faith is stronger your poll is stronger why is it it is testifying to me that there's our people that's ready they're ready for the word and due season and the wind of the Holy Ghost ain't just working on me it's working on you it's getting you ready it's a time like never before for the wind to get behind our face and to push our faith in there's such a spot that will look over top of these buzzards and we'll start knocking these buzzards on top of the head and we'll say go down through the demons of hell [Music] if he's that strong to save you from your sin call somebody that has been against you all of your life all the way down through your DNA genetics there's been stacked up against you all kinds of sin but there's some people that's broke the cycle some people say well my mama died of cancer my sister died of kids my brother died of cancer it's a time we let the wind of change push that cycle out of our life I'm not willing to accept another cycle I'm not willing to lose I'm not willing to lose and I'm not willing to leave my first love they've been revival after a revival but they just kept dying it was a circle it was a cycle of revival and death so I could revive on death you're the last people come on some might have to lay on the same church they say no more ages so I want you to look where your help is coming from I want you to look to the heavens and look for the body change sister Kearney if I told you in the morning he's coming I'd say you'd be ready I'd say you get ready let's live like he's coming tomorrow morning you with me brother heaven let's live like he's coming tomorrow morning little out so we control we've been strong as a church we've been hit after hit after hit after blow after blow but we keep rising up and Satan has done what he thinks is his worst and that's bad said right before he went into surgery Satan is that all you got [Applause] [Music] we got a champion as a pastor but later than a champion of a pasta there's a champion in this velvet and Lola lives now that'll bring you out of sickness bring you on a torment [Applause] Satan will regret the day that he pointed his sword at us but say that this is he said bear long time coming it's been a long time coming but to hear before the foundation of the world you were sent in that pew it may look like you has never come in but you're here well Jason it was a long time coming

closet he can meet you in yours he can give you a public testimony now shake the world with it if he come in my room at 2:40 in the morning before we would go through what would seem like the valley
