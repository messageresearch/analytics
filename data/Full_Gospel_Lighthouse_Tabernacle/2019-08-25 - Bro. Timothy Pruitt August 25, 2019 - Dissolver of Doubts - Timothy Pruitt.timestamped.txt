[2:02] in this day as well and it's honor to
[2:05] better serve together with them and with
[2:08] you a man as the children of God
[2:10] fighting the same enemy and gonna come
[2:13] out victorious
[2:15] amen I'm not fighting this battle to
[2:17] lose I'm fighting to win amen
[2:20] so I'll bring you greetings from our
[2:22] church and also of course for my father
[2:25] but the team be here in a few days but
[2:27] amen we just love you with the love of
[2:29] the Lord
[2:30] Daniel chapter 5 and verse 12 says for
[2:33] as much as an excellent spirit and
[2:36] knowledge and understanding interpreting
[2:39] of dreams and showing of heart sentences
[2:42] and dissolving of doubts were found in
[2:46] the same Daniel whom the king named
[2:49] Belteshazzar now let Daniel be called
[2:52] and he will show the interpretation amen
[2:57] we'll let you be seated this evening I
[3:01] like to speak to you this evening on the
[3:04] dissolver of doubts the dissolver of
[3:07] doubts
[3:08] you know this scripture that we just
[3:10] read was at the moment where the writing
[3:15] came on the wall and the men of that
[3:18] Kingdom and of that day could not give
[3:20] the interpretation but it was remembered
[3:23] that there was a man in the kingdom who
[3:25] could and he was able to give the
[3:28] interpretation who had the an excellent
[3:30] spirit and knowledge and understanding
[3:32] of interpreting of dreams and showing of
[3:35] heart sentences the dissolving of doubts
[3:38] were found in the same Daniel now this
[3:41] was not Daniel's ability this was not
[3:44] his own thinking this is not something
[3:46] that he could he could produce on his
[3:48] own but amen this was actually the
[3:50] spirit of Christ that was showing
[3:52] through Daniel Amen the knowledge of God
[3:54] as it would come to Daniel and would
[3:56] come into his into his life a man and I
[3:59] believe that same God is in it at this
[4:01] hour that we're living in he's still the
[4:03] dissolver of doubts his spirit is still
[4:07] here his spirit is still anointing men
[4:09] his spirit is still anointing you a man
[4:11] in the hour that we're living in now
[4:13] when he goes to dissolve our doubts he
[4:16] has to you has to give you a place that
[4:19] you'll be able to stand upon that you'll
[4:21] be able to rest upon him and he does not
[4:24] give you a theology or an idea
[4:26] he gives you himself his word Amen that
[4:29] you can stand in the face of every kind
[4:32] of torment and spirit in the face of
[4:34] every kind of doubt and fear and anxiety
[4:37] or whatever you're facing he gives you
[4:40] something that you can stand on now just
[4:43] because he's giving it and he has given
[4:44] us a message in this hour and I believe
[4:47] this message that we have is a message
[4:49] that's been vindicated by the presence
[4:52] of the pillar of fire of Almighty God
[4:54] amen showing that it's not just the
[4:57] ideas or the thoughts of a seventh grade
[4:59] Kentuckian preacher but it was actually
[5:02] God come down and this day to reveal
[5:04] himself amen that God came to speak to
[5:07] us to show us who we are in the hour
[5:10] that we live in a man and he vindicated
[5:13] in such a way that there shouldn't be
[5:15] any doubts there shouldn't be any kind
[5:17] of thing that would clouded but you know
[5:18] how Satan always coming to come against
[5:21] those things and he tries to bring up
[5:23] doubts but God came in at night after
[5:26] night after night
[5:27] amen showing him so showing that it
[5:29] wasn't just a man that would speak him
[5:31] but God was coming behind it and saying
[5:35] amen amen you know as he said there in
[5:38] Revelations three and two the Laodicean
[5:40] church AZ said I am the faithful and
[5:43] true witness the a man of God he's a
[5:46] faithful and true witness now God does
[5:49] not witness or stand for anything that's
[5:51] a lie or wrong or or you know is it's
[5:55] false or some man's own interpretation
[5:57] or some man's own ideas but he is a
[5:59] faithful and true right amen
[6:02] a witness so it has to be something
[6:04] that's true for him to stand behind it a
[6:07] man and that's what we have witness in
[6:09] this hour through the ministry of
[6:10] William Branham was God coming behind it
[6:13] I know and be able to discern the
[6:15] thoughts and intents of a heart no man
[6:17] could do that now a man can maybe do
[6:20] something say a few nut words of
[6:21] knowledge and get it right every once in
[6:23] a while but this was a hundred percent
[6:25] every time and there wasn't a man that
[6:28] can there's not a man they can do that
[6:29] Daniel couldn't do it nobody could do it
[6:32] only God could do it what was God doing
[6:34] he was coming behind the word and saying
[6:37] amen
[6:38] this is my word this is my prophet this
[6:41] is my this is my thoughts as the mind of
[6:44] God that's being spoke amen I am saying
[6:47] Amen to it
[6:48] Amen I think of the time but the Branham
[6:51] was actually I forget the sermon but
[6:53] right off the top of my hair but he was
[6:55] actually telling about the cloud that
[6:57] had come in in the desert there and the
[6:59] picture that we have in the Life
[7:00] magazine he was showing it to the people
[7:02] Amen that people want to say nowadays
[7:05] was caused by a rocket or something like
[7:07] that but whatever but he was showing
[7:09] this and he was showing it that it was
[7:11] the angels of God that were there a man
[7:14] as he whereas he was the seals were
[7:16] being revealed to him and you know it
[7:18] amazes me that people want to make it
[7:20] out to be a liar or make it to be a
[7:21] fable but right during that same sermon
[7:24] was a man that fell over dead with a
[7:27] heart attack and then brother Branham
[7:29] goes down there and begins to pray for
[7:31] him the man's give him back his life
[7:33] again what was it it was God coming back
[7:36] behind it saying a man he's a dissolver
[7:40] of doubts and he he has given us a firm
[7:42] foundation in this hour that we don't
[7:44] have to go anywhere else he's given us a
[7:47] word to stand on to dissolve our doubts
[7:50] and to give us a perfect peace in the
[7:53] time of storms amen
[7:54] but you know that doesn't mean that
[7:56] you're not going to have my own battles
[7:58] that doesn't mean you're not going to
[8:00] have troubles that doesn't mean you're
[8:01] not going to have tests that does not
[8:03] mean you're not going to face fear or
[8:05] have mind battles by mind battles are
[8:07] nothing new they came right at the very
[8:10] moment the fall took place mine battles
[8:12] beginning to take place
[8:14] I mean could you imagine the mind
[8:16] battles that Noah faces he built an ark
[8:19] could you imagine the videos that were
[8:22] put out in that time of how I left
[8:24] noah's message Amen just because
[8:28] somebody can put a video together why I
[8:30] left a message or why I did that doesn't
[8:33] make them to be true a man they had have
[8:35] made the same things that Noah's could
[8:36] you imagine I've been there and there
[8:38] and looked at the Ark Encounter of how
[8:40] they've tried to replicated the best of
[8:43] their knowledge and it's an incredible
[8:45] thing no doubt there was many people
[8:47] that laughed and made fun of him and
[8:49] said are you done lost your mind you're
[8:51] crazy
[8:52] look at the weather ahead rain and how
[8:54] many days before and there's no rain in
[8:56] the forecast you're a crazy guy but no
[8:58] doubt at every nail went into the wood
[9:00] that whispers Satan was coming and
[9:03] saying yeah you just thought you heard
[9:05] the Word of God you just thought of it
[9:07] it was 120 years he preached this but
[9:10] God's Word his prophecy amen will be
[9:13] fulfilled
[9:15] hey man and he's dissolves the doubts
[9:18] how does he dissolve the doubts by
[9:20] fulfilling his word amen and Abraham no
[9:23] doubt faced mind battles he waited on
[9:25] the promised son it wasn't a quick thing
[9:28] it wasn't just in a moment it was some
[9:30] 25 years he waited for the promised son
[9:33] amen but God brought it to pass
[9:36] amen Sarah no doubt had my own battles
[9:39] you know God would speak to Abraham God
[9:41] wouldn't speak to her and she didn't
[9:43] even know if she was part of the promise
[9:45] and she tried to fulfill it on her own
[9:47] and try to bring it by by her own mind
[9:49] her own abilities but that wasn't the
[9:51] Word of God but God had her in his plan
[9:54] a man you know you know I can think of
[9:58] Abraham as after he received the prompt
[10:00] could you imagine the mine battles he
[10:03] went through is and when God said now
[10:05] you take this boy and you go sacrifice
[10:07] him could you imagine the mind battles
[10:11] he went through hey man you no way you
[10:15] said well mind battles I've got mine
[10:19] everybody's he has mine battles the
[10:24] greatest battle ever fought it is in the
[10:26] mind it isn't World War one two and
[10:31] three that's to come the greatest battle
[10:33] ever fought is in the mind the Satan has
[10:36] a right to attack you there and he's
[10:38] constantly trying to whisper in your ear
[10:40] no doubt today he's trying to tell you
[10:42] this message ain't for you or he tried
[10:45] to tell you that he listens to somebody
[10:47] else's ideas he's trying to tell you
[10:49] you're lost and you cross the line he
[10:51] tries to tell you all kinds of things
[10:56] Abraham would say that when it woke up
[10:59] they said told his services you stay
[11:01] here and watch the mules the lad now
[11:03] we're going to worship and the
[11:05] Ladd and I will return why what was he
[11:09] going back to no doubt he had in mind
[11:10] battles but he would go back to the word
[11:13] the word said Isaac was the promised son
[11:16] and out of Isaac shall thy seed be
[11:19] called so he knew that if grave he had
[11:21] to slam God would raise him up God would
[11:25] provide his sacrifice he went back to
[11:29] the word amen you know as annoyed but no
[11:33] doubt the devil stood on one side and as
[11:35] he said that the lad now returned on
[11:38] that but the devil stood there and said
[11:39] Abraham you told a lie you know he's
[11:43] always there to whispers for a moment
[11:46] but there's something they don't know
[11:48] there's some a browser there's something
[11:49] down here that tells me even if I have
[11:52] to kill him I'll receive him as one from
[11:54] the dead God can raise him up again the
[11:57] lad and I will return why because God
[12:00] told me through this son the seed would
[12:02] save nations and he changed my name and
[12:05] he put H a.m. on the end of my name I'm
[12:08] the father of Nations through this seed
[12:10] I don't know how God's going to do it
[12:12] but he's going to do it hey man it gives
[12:17] you something to stand on when you go
[12:20] back to thus saith the Lord hallelujah
[12:24] and listen that's not just some Catholic
[12:26] cynical story or something Tisha's fairy
[12:29] tale it's thus saith the Lord God makes
[12:33] no difference for how we're coming back
[12:38] hallelujah amen when you have man
[12:41] battles about your own children and
[12:43] their salvation you need to go back to
[12:45] the scriptures and said they shall be
[12:47] there and their offspring with him I
[12:52] don't know how he's gonna do it makes no
[12:55] difference for me he said it I believe
[12:57] it
[13:04] hey man could you imagine Jacobs mind
[13:07] battles as he waited to meet his brother
[13:09] but what happened to Jacob he changed
[13:12] his life forever well around him cities
[13:14] he was on one side of the river deceiver
[13:18] on the other side of the river a limping
[13:20] prince he met an angel has done saith
[13:25] the Lord changed his name a man Moses
[13:27] had my own battles
[13:30] wondering how God was ever going to use
[13:32] a failure like him he had tried to do it
[13:35] he had tried on his own and produce one
[13:37] dead Egyptian how God is gonna use me
[13:40] I'm just gonna go out in the desert and
[13:42] forget all about it he may have forgot
[13:44] all about it but God didn't forget come
[13:48] on somebody you may have forgot about
[13:51] God's calling purpose in your life but
[13:53] God hasn't forgot
[13:59] hey man brother branham had mine battles
[14:03] we read this through you said this
[14:05] morning I was listening a few days to a
[14:07] broadcasters seem to want to tell that
[14:10] creation just came from some ashes
[14:11] blowing together and some fossil faint
[14:14] and a few chemicals of the earth and the
[14:17] warm sunshine now created ain't it
[14:19] amazing it it takes more faith to
[14:21] believe two little things come together
[14:23] and we got what we got today than to
[14:25] believe God said let there be a man you
[14:32] didn't know what a theist had more faith
[14:33] than we got mercy to believe that and
[14:39] all of a sudden two little particles
[14:43] floating out in who knows where all of a
[14:45] sudden happened to meet someday and boom
[14:47] and now that way it was a boom all right
[14:49] it was let there be here's a boon hey
[14:55] man he said but that thing begin to work
[14:58] in his mind you know and he tried taking
[15:00] my little girl to school on the road
[15:02] back I went to he said Satan started
[15:04] trying to punch at me that this is the
[15:06] way it was
[15:08] he says going up the street and Satan
[15:11] said to me said do you know that there's
[15:13] man you called Jesus was just a man like
[15:15] one day in his day like Billy Graham or
[15:17] Roberts he was just a man that just to
[15:19] have a few people to gather around him
[15:21] and say he was a great man and after a
[15:23] while he became greater and then he
[15:25] became a god to them and now it's
[15:27] scattered all over the world since he's
[15:29] dead and that's all
[15:30] and I said Satan how a liar you are hey
[15:36] man that's what you need to look at that
[15:38] devil and I said Satan
[15:39] you're a liar how a liar you are and I
[15:43] turned to those Crossin Graham says that
[15:45] Satan you that's talking to my
[15:47] conscience I'd like to ask you a few
[15:49] things who was it that the Hebrew
[15:51] prophet spoke would come who was the
[15:54] Anointed Messiah who was the man who
[15:57] foresaw him and told his life thousands
[15:59] of years before he got it who wasn't the
[16:02] foretold it right down to the letter
[16:04] that he would call me be numbered with
[16:07] the transgressors wounded for our
[16:09] transgression he was grave was with the
[16:11] rich but he would rise up on the third
[16:13] day and he did and then he promised the
[16:16] Holy Ghost and I've got it so you might
[16:19] as well get away from me because it's
[16:21] written in the word and every word is
[16:24] true he fled from me just give him the
[16:28] word he is the deserver of doubts Amen
[16:38] Jesus had mine battles we can read about
[16:42] it you know where you think of things
[16:43] sometimes in one way but when it talks
[16:46] about he went into the wilderness or was
[16:47] tempted in the devil taking them up to
[16:51] the holy city and seen him put on
[16:52] brought him up to the pinnacle of the
[16:54] temple if he was watching that whole
[16:56] thing you wouldn't have seen the devil
[16:59] you'd have saw this man going up to the
[17:01] top of a temple and looking down and
[17:03] wondering going through all the strain
[17:05] of a mind battle the devil talking to
[17:10] him amen
[17:12] remember what did Jesus do he would take
[17:15] him back to the word that's the only
[17:18] place you can stand on is the word you
[17:21] only stand on your own conviction so
[17:23] long your own idea so long but you
[17:25] can stand on the word eternal because it
[17:28] is eternal Amen God but in every case
[17:32] God sent his word in every case when
[17:35] they were backed in the corner they
[17:36] could stop and rest upon the word and
[17:39] you can rest upon the same word today
[17:41] God has given us a word in this day he
[17:45] Christ is a solid foundation we can
[17:48] stand on he is over vindicated this
[17:51] message we can believe it no matter what
[17:56] critics say no matter how Satan would
[18:00] come and try to tear it down
[18:02] God is the dissolver of doubts and one
[18:07] day all these doubters are going to be
[18:09] left behind just like they were in the
[18:11] days of Noah just like they were all the
[18:14] way down through the scriptures
[18:16] one day as they walked out of Egypt
[18:18] there was some that doubted and we're
[18:20] left behind Satan is always there to try
[18:28] to bring unbelief let's turn him to
[18:32] second Kings 6 and verse 24 and it came
[18:39] to pass that bit of dad king of Syria
[18:43] gathered all his hosts up and went and
[18:45] besieged Samaria there was a great
[18:48] famine in Samaria and behold they
[18:50] besieged it until ass's head was sold
[18:53] for fourscore pieces of silver and a
[18:56] fourth part of a cab of doves dung for
[18:59] five pieces of silver so that wasn't a
[19:01] bad situation
[19:02] I had to look that up what in the world
[19:06] has doves done I know man know what it
[19:08] is but what in the world would it be
[19:09] worth that kind of money for and just
[19:13] Seifer Josephus actually was one of the
[19:16] theologians of the Jewish traditions and
[19:18] things he actually says that it was
[19:21] actually sold as salt for food and he
[19:28] had to pay five pieces of silver for
[19:30] doves dung and as the king of Israel was
[19:35] passing upon the wall there cried a
[19:37] woman saying help me O Lord
[19:39] when did we going down to the store how
[19:41] the data they've gotten such a famine
[19:43] because of the siege that was taking
[19:45] place until they begin to eat their own
[19:47] children it was in a bad situation and
[19:50] they go but they go to the prophet's
[19:53] house and they go to the prophet's house
[19:56] and they begin to talk to him and in
[19:57] chapter 7 and verse 1 says and Elijah
[20:00] said hear ye the word of the Lord
[20:03] thus saith the Lord tomorrow at about
[20:08] this time shall a measure of fine flour
[20:11] be showed for sold for a shekel and 2
[20:14] measures of barley for a shekel in the
[20:17] gate of Samaria what a turn Amen for a
[20:22] head of a donkey in for doves dung to be
[20:25] sold for an exorbitant amount of money
[20:27] until we're fine flour will be just as
[20:30] common a few pennies could buy you a
[20:32] meal in just one day is all it's going
[20:35] to be
[20:37] that'll be rejoicing in the streets that
[20:41] have been shouting and praising God for
[20:43] the Prophet had said thus saith the Lord
[20:47] now they had enough history with this
[20:50] man they knew this man knew what he was
[20:51] talking about because before this story
[20:54] Amen Elisha is in the in a place era and
[20:57] he begins to uh he begins to Missa
[21:01] besieged by the Samaria of the Syrians
[21:03] and you know the story walks out and
[21:05] this is his servant is all tore up about
[21:08] it and he's wondering why it was source
[21:11] around and he said boy there's more with
[21:13] us than there is against us he said well
[21:18] what do you mean he said Lord open this

[21:53] Syria and walks right up to him and
[21:55] leads him right into the city a man feel
[21:58] therefore hip for the different into a
[22:00] trap and they don't even know who he is

[22:08] spoke to him come on somebody a man had
[22:15] enough history to know when he said thus
[22:17] saith the Lord
[22:18] it meant thus saith the Lord but the
[22:22] next verse said then a lord on whose
[22:25] hand the King leaned answered the man of
[22:27] God and said behold if the Lord oh
[22:30] that's a big word if if the Lord
[22:36] a man would make windows and heaven
[22:39] might this thing be so in other words
[22:42] God's gonna have to do it the way I
[22:43] think he's going to do it hello somebody
[22:51] notice this wasn't capital L Ord this
[22:54] was little lor D the Lord on whose hand
[23:01] the King leaned answered the men of God

[23:05] windows of heaven might this thing be
[23:08] and he said behold thou shalt and the
[23:10] man that prophet of God answered said
[23:12] behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes
[23:15] but shall not eat thereof oma but there
[23:22] were four lepers they heard what the
[23:26] prophet said now I know leprosy

[23:31] that road but lepers is also beggars
[23:34] there also the loss of the of the totem
[23:36] pole so to speak but we were all born in
[23:38] sin shaped iniquity but there was
[23:41] something on the inside of us they could
[23:43] believe what a prophet said
[23:47] hallelujah we hired a crowd from another
[23:50] dimension somewhere Amen those leper

[24:10] enter into the city then the families in
[24:12] the city and we die there if we sit here

[24:17] into the hosts of the Syrians and if
[24:19] they save us alive we shall live if they
[24:21] kill us we shall die and they rose up at
[24:24] twilight to go into the camp of Syrians
[24:26] and when they come to the uttermost part
[24:29] of the camp of Syria behold there was no
[24:32] man there for the Lord had made the host

[29:06] what was going on in the enemy's camp
[29:13] Amen if we could just go down into hell

[29:19] him out to be as we heard last night
[29:22] he's stupid he's a felicity I can hear

[30:23] don't want to go there the last time I
[30:26] went there they destroyed me the last
[30:28] time I went there they woke me from one
[30:30] side of that church to another I don't
[30:32] want to go there
[30:34] the devil is having my battles tonight
[30:40] let me tell you the devil is already
[30:42] worried about this weekend is coming hi
[30:48] why I'm going to the enemy's camp and
[30:51] I'm gonna take back what he stole from
[30:54] me
[30:56] hallelujah he stole my joy I'm taking it
[30:59] back
[30:59] he stole my peace I'm taking it back he
[31:03] stole my happiness I'm taking it back
[31:09] oh come on the hell it is the sound of
[31:16] the hosts of angels that are gathering
[31:19] here
[31:22] [Applause]
[31:25] hallelujah and the lepers came to the
[31:28] uttermost part of the camp and they went
[31:30] into the tent we go back where for there
[31:33] rose verse seven and in the Twilight and
[31:37] they left joy and they left peace and
[31:41] they left happiness and they left
[31:43] comfort and they left all the things
[31:45] that God had given to his children
[31:47] because why why because the land that
[31:50] they was on belonged to the children of
[31:51] Israel a man and they fled for their
[32:03] life for leopards walking down the road
[32:11] headed to the camp
[32:19] he's hired somebody to come against this
[32:21] that's not and they fled and the lepers
[32:28] came to the uttermost part of the camp
[32:30] and they went into one service and did
[32:33] eat and drink and carried then silver
[32:36] and gold and raiment and went and hid it
[32:39] and went to another service and entered
[32:41] into it and came and went and hid it and
[32:44] they went to another service we do not
[32:50] well to stay of day of good tidings and
[32:53] we hold our peace if we tarry to the
[32:56] morning light submissive with Carmona's
[32:58] now therefore let's come and go and tell
[32:59] the high Kings household and they came
[33:02] and called him to the porter and told
[33:04] him we come to the camp there was no man
[33:06] there no voice of a man oh the devil is
[33:09] whispering voice has been shut up a man
[33:13] the horse's time they asked his tie the
[33:15] tenses they were and they called the
[33:17] porters and they towed it to the king's
[33:19] house and the King rose of the night and
[33:21] said I will not show you what the
[33:23] Syrians have done to us they know that
[33:24] we'd be hungry therefore they've gone
[33:26] out of the camp to hide themselves and
[33:28] then when we come out of city they'll
[33:29] catch us still unbelief why because he
[33:33] was leaning on the wrong Lord he was
[33:38] leaning on his family's traditions or
[33:41] his family's ideas or whatever we got
[33:44] all kinds of crutches we lean on we can
[33:48] lead on generational curses and say well
[33:50] my grandfather had it my daddy had it
[33:52] now I got it listen you don't have to
[33:54] continue with a generational curse you
[33:58] don't have to relate on that Lord there
[34:00] is a Lord for you to lean oh I lean on
[34:04] Jesus hey man we lean on our daddies
[34:13] experience and her mamas experience we
[34:17] lean on all kinds of things there's only
[34:19] one to lean on that's capital L Ord
[34:26] but we go down this was Johar on they
[34:31] walked in the ways of his father a have
[34:33] made in himself false gods the people of
[34:37] Samaria fallen just like their king that
[34:40] forsaking the God of Israel they didn't
[34:42] remember the words of Jacob the Lord
[34:44] that God is one God so in wicked
[34:46] idolatry they bow down to idols of
[34:49] heathens therefore the Lord of Hosts
[34:50] suffered their enemies to oppress them
[34:52] and they come to this moment but for the
[34:59] elects sake Elijah's sake the Lord sent
[35:05] a promise that the next day food would
[35:09] that could not be obtained at any price
[35:11] would be able to be obtained at the
[35:13] cheapest price he did it for the elects
[35:17] sake amen he says we may picture the joy
[35:23] the multitude when the prophet
[35:25] prophesied they knew him to be a prophet
[35:27] he'd been vindicated all his past
[35:29] prophecies have been filled that
[35:31] fulfilled they knew he was a man sent
[35:33] from God and proclaiming God's message
[35:35] surely the Kings eyes would glisten with
[35:38] the light tomorrow tomorrow our hunger
[35:41] would be over and we'll feast to the
[35:43] fullness but however the Lord ellic
[35:46] little lor D an intellectual man a great
[35:50] man said impossible if the Lord would
[35:53] make the windows in heaven might be such
[35:55] a thing but it's in laying the fact that
[35:57] after repeated proofs of Elijah's
[36:00] ministry he still yet disbelieved no
[36:05] matter how many miracles he witness he
[36:07] still didn't believe he had no doubt
[36:12] seen the marvelous defeat of Moab he had
[36:14] see been startled at the tidings of the
[36:17] resurrection of shoe those shoe to my
[36:19] son he knew that Elijah had revealed
[36:22] better their secrets and smitten his
[36:24] hosts with blindness he had seen the
[36:26] bands of cereal blinded him brought into
[36:29] the heart of Samaria he knew the story
[36:32] of the widow who's always filled with
[36:34] field who's all filled all the vessels
[36:37] and redeemed her son he knew the cure of
[36:39] naman that was common no doubt common
[36:42] conversation in the court getting in the
[36:44] face of all this evidence he doubted his
[36:53] sin was unbelief Spurgeon was say it
[37:00] like this and this is just this is
[37:02] amazing he had a way with words
[37:04] he said unbelief has more phases than
[37:08] the moon it has more come colors than a
[37:11] chameleon common people today say the
[37:15] devil that he is sometimes in one shape
[37:17] or sometimes in another he said I'm sure
[37:20] this is true of Satan's firstborn child
[37:24] unbelief for its and for its forms or
[37:30] Legion at one time I see unbelief
[37:32] dressed as an angel of light it calls
[37:36] itself humility and it says I would not
[37:39] be presumptuous I dare not think that
[37:41] God would pardon me I'm too great a
[37:43] sinner false humility his unbelief hey
[37:51] man well I'm just humble no it's
[37:53] unbelief we call that him humility and
[37:58] thank God he says that our friend is in
[38:00] such a good condition he said I don't
[38:02] think God for any such delusion it's the
[38:04] devil dressed as an angel of light it is
[38:08] unbelief after all and other times we
[38:11] detect unbelief in the shape of the
[38:12] doubt of God's immutability the Lord has
[38:15] loved me but he will cast me off
[38:18] tomorrow
[38:18] he helped me yesterday and under the
[38:21] shadow of his wings I trust but will I
[38:23] receive help in the next time he may
[38:25] have cast me off
[38:27] he may be unmindful of his covenant and
[38:29] forgetful to be gracious that is
[38:31] unbelief because God cannot change his
[38:34] thought of you
[38:36] all glory to car a man can change this
[38:40] thought one day I like you the next day
[38:42] I hate you
[38:43] but if God ever put his name in you he
[38:47] cannot change his mind about you he said
[38:54] sometimes this Sun belief is embodied in
[38:57] the doubt of God's power surely this
[39:02] difficulty is too great and the Lord
[39:04] cannot deliver us we strive to get rid
[39:07] of our burden find that we cannot do it
[39:09] we think God is as short as ours so at
[39:12] God's arm is as short as our arm and his
[39:14] power is as little as a human's of power
[39:17] fearful form of unbelief is that doubt
[39:19] which keep us keeps men from coming to
[39:22] Christ which leads the sinner to
[39:24] distrust the ability of Christ to save
[39:26] him the doubt of the willingness of
[39:28] Jesus to accept so great a transgressor
[39:31] but the most hideous of all is the
[39:33] traitor in his true colours blaspheming
[39:35] God and madly denying his existence but
[39:39] in every one of them it's still unbelief
[39:47] amen brother Brennan would say the
[39:49] greatest enemy God's got greatest
[39:50] enemies faith God his unbelief he said
[39:54] you know even Jesus himself could not do
[39:56] mighty miracles because of their
[39:58] unbelief no matter what they saw but we
[40:08] find the battle comes in two minds the
[40:16] greatest battle ever fought brother
[40:17] Branham talked about the mind with what
[40:20] God took the heart Satan takes the mind
[40:22] and Satan is always there in your mind
[40:25] every day it seemed like every moment
[40:29] thoughts
[40:30] oh brother Brad will tell the teller and
[40:36] it's so true so simple he said you know
[40:38] you can't keep us like a bird you can't
[40:40] keep them from flying over your head but
[40:42] you can keep them from building a nest
[40:46] but meant some of us walk around with
[40:48] these huge nests look like ten crows
[40:51] living that dude hey man we got all
[40:55] kinds of things and we've allowed Satan
[40:57] to cram onto a listen I know I've been
[40:59] there we just build all these thought
[41:03] kingdoms you know in these thoughts and
[41:04] Satan's in our thoughts and our minds
[41:06] they say we're so low that we can't even
[41:08] get enough enough victory about us to
[41:10] raise their hands in church and the
[41:11] worship of God anymore
[41:12] why because of our thoughts but let me
[41:16] let you in on some it ain't your
[41:17] thoughts it's the devil's thoughts come
[41:24] on now it's his thoughts amen it's his
[41:29] iniquity it's his sin it's his lies it
[41:32] ain't mine hallelujah I don't know maybe
[41:39] it's safe to tell this here we're my dad
[41:43] Adam in his house these certain birds I
[41:46] won't call the name cuz it's basically
[41:48] illegal to shoot them but anyway they'd
[41:51] like to build big mud huts on the side
[41:53] of your house he was building his hood
[41:56] on the side of his house if we tried to
[41:57] shoo it off tried to be nice

[42:23] he was trying to take something that
[42:25] wasn't his a place that wasn't his that
[42:28] never ever ever ever belonged to him and
[42:36] the devil wants to do the same thing to
[42:38] you take a part of your mind and your
[42:40] mind and take places that never ever
[42:43] ever ever ever ever ever belong to him
[42:47] hey man but I know one thing to take him

[42:53] and new testaments aim that promise
[42:55] right out here and say devil I'm not

[43:12] him back to the word you say the word is
[43:20] true you take the word he says let the
[43:23] spirit come to your heart open your mind

[46:22] he said like a little chicken tipping
[46:25] itself out maybe you've been in a shell
[46:30] I've been all shelled in Satan's talk to
[46:35] you into your corner
[46:37] into this little hole you know what
[46:40] happens happens when we get in those
[46:43] conditions let me read you something
[46:45] right quick I may have read this here
[46:49] before but this is worth reading again
[46:51] if I can find it what happens when we
[46:54] get in our little in our little corner
[46:56] we get old we got old all into our own
[47:00] thoughts and it's our world becomes all
[47:03] about us and pretty soon we lose the
[47:08] burden for others we lose the burden for
[47:11] the other people and it becomes just
[47:13] about us and our problems times some of
[47:18] you start pecking your way out I can't
[47:20] do it this isn't a little chickie and a
[47:23] pet and an egg you want to help him so
[47:26] bad because you're you know you can able
[47:28] just come but you're killing me
[47:31] he'll die right there if you try
[47:33] anything he's trying to get his way out
[47:35] I can't do it for you brother Ron can't
[47:37] do it nothing ain't enough amount of
[47:39] counseling can help if you don't start
[47:42] pecking start whacking at it saying I'm
[47:46] not going I'm not gonna be this way this
[47:48] ain't Who I am
[47:49] listen you don't have to be living with
[47:51] a bitterness in your heart you don't
[47:52] have to be living with unforgiveness in
[47:54] your heart you know what he's what Jesus
[48:00] said in his own prairie said forgive us
[48:01] as we forgive others so what was he
[48:05] saying the same forgiveness that you
[48:06] give is the forgiveness you'll receive
[48:10] we want God to forgive us of all kinds
[48:13] of things like that man that Jesus talks
[48:15] about he was forgiven I don't I preached
[48:17] the sermon about heart trouble heart
[48:19] trouble over seventeen dollars 17
[48:24] 17 bucks remember the story Jesus
[48:27] telling though I'm going here but we're
[48:29] going there was a man went to the king
[48:32] he told him I hope you added it up it
[48:33] was in the millions of dollars millions
[48:36] of dollars and the king was going to
[48:39] take his children take everything he had
[48:41] and he begged for forgiveness and the
[48:43] King wrote it all off pardon he walks
[48:45] out the door of the church I mean of the
[48:48] of the
[48:51] of the castle walks outside and there
[48:55] was this man that owed him $17 and he
[48:58] took everything you had from him and
[49:00] throw him into prison the forgiveness
[49:04] that you give is the forgiveness you'll
[49:07] receive listen his life is a series of
[49:11] problems either you're in one now or
[49:14] you're just coming out of one or you're
[49:17] getting ready to go into another one but
[49:23] the reason for this that God is more
[49:25] interested in your character than your
[49:27] comfort hey man God is more interested
[49:31] in your character than your comfort God
[49:34] is more interested in making your life
[49:36] holy than he is making your life happy
[49:39] you can be happy here on earth but
[49:41] that's not the goal of life the goal is
[49:44] to grow in the character of Christ's
[49:46] likeness no matter how good things are
[49:49] in your life there's always something
[49:50] bad that needs to be worked on no matter
[49:52] how bad things are in your life there's
[49:54] always something good you can thank God
[49:55] for you can focus on your purpose or you
[49:59] can focus on your problems you can focus
[50:01] on your problems when you do that you're
[50:03] going into self-centeredness which is my
[50:05] problem my issues in my pain and but one
[50:10] of the easiest ways to get rid of the
[50:12] pain is to get your focus off yourself
[50:15] and get it back on to God and to others
[50:19] amen so we need to ask ourselves am I
[50:22] going to live for possessions or
[50:24] popularity am I going to be or am I
[50:26] gonna be driven by pressures and guilt
[50:28] and bitterness or materialism or am I
[50:31] going to be driven by God's purpose for
[50:34] my life so when I get up in the morning
[50:39] I want to sit on the side of my bed and
[50:41] say God if I don't get anything else
[50:43] done today I want to know you more and
[50:46] love you better see God put us on earth
[50:49] he didn't put us here just to fulfill it
[50:52] to do list because he's more interested
[50:55] than what I am than what I do
[51:00] therefore that's why he calls us human
[51:01] beings and not human doings so in happy
[51:07] moments praise God difficult moments
[51:11] seek God quite moments worship God
[51:13] painful moments trust God in every
[51:16] moment thank God hey man thank God I'm
[51:22] thinking because they called me in this
[51:24] out the greatest time with ever was
[51:27] Olivia
[51:28] and yes it's dark and yes it's terrible
[51:31] and there's a terrible oppression and
[51:33] all these things but I'm not looking to
[51:35] that I'm looking to the author and the
[51:37] finisher of my faith he put me here for
[51:41] a purpose
[51:44] he's the resolver of doubts mercy yo
[51:55] have no reason to disbelieve matter of
[52:00] fact it would be as they say a sin to
[52:02] disbelief how many times as God showed
[52:06] things in this church and has come to
[52:07] pass mercy how many miracles and things
[52:12] inside visions do we have to point to I
[52:20] think about the moment brother wrong was
[52:26] laying in the hospital
[52:28] and I'll never forget when it swept over
[52:31] me as he spoke about last night
[52:34] my dad had called me out to the bar and
[52:36] he came home early from a meeting
[52:38] because he just felt the pressure to go
[52:40] see brother Ron he just didn't know what
[52:42] was going on and she wanted to go see
[52:44] for herself he called me out that
[52:46] morning to the bar and he said he'd talk
[52:47] with you and he'd just flew in the
[52:51] Sunday night this is Monday morning and
[52:55] he says I got this I don't know we're
[52:57] getting word everything that they're
[53:01] putting out it sounds good he said but
[53:03] then brother berry coffee or somebody
[53:04] called him told him what was really
[53:06] going on and he said I got to go for
[53:09] myself he said I think I'm gonna do some
[53:10] things and I got tomorrow
[53:13] so I'll probably leave out Wednesday
[53:14] morning and it just you got to go now he
[53:21] said he looked at me I'll never forget
[53:23] he said now I said yes now now's the
[53:26] moment he saw what about your mom what
[53:30] about the chores I said dad we can take
[53:31] care of the chores I'll go tell the
[53:33] family come on out we'll take care of it
[53:35] and I'll run down there and tell mom to
[53:37] get a close-packed we're leaving a
[53:39] couple of minutes 3045 minute hours some
[53:43] wouldn't very long there was out the
[53:44] door and gone I'll never forget that
[53:46] moment but I think about that moment how
[53:51] many lives were impacted by that moment
[53:54] this church because at that moment
[53:59] brother Andrew wasn't where he is today
[54:02] God knows all things he's the dissolver
[54:06] of doubts this church wouldn't be where
[54:09] it is if that moment would had a
[54:11] different outcome
[54:12] and I'm talking about brother Ron's life
[54:20] we've got no reason to disbelieve we've
[54:25] seen it time after time enter town
[54:29] gods of dissolver of doubts he knows how
[54:34] to answer the questions in your life he
[54:39] knows exactly how to come to where
[54:40] you're living at and tell you exactly
[54:43] what you're going through and tell you
[54:46] exactly you're about to make a mistake
[54:48] you need to do it this way you need to
[54:50] go this way this is what the Lord said
[54:52] God knows all of me listen he knows your
[54:55] zip code he knows your address
[55:00] he knows the room he's sleeping and he's
[55:04] concerned about the most minut detail
[55:08] you know we put God somewhere way off
[55:10] somewhere and you know he's off in the
[55:12] clouds floating somewhere and you know
[55:14] he's left and we're here fighting it
[55:16] knowing he's right here among us he
[55:20] knows exactly what this age is like he
[55:22] knows exactly the pressures you're going
[55:24] through he knows exactly the trouble
[55:26] you're having on
[55:26] job or The Situation's you're facing
[55:28] there in your marriage or whatever he
[55:30] knows all about it down to the my new
[55:34] detail and listen let me tell you
[55:37] something this doesn't the meta the the
[55:39] anointing that we witness and then the
[55:42] Ministry of William Branham was not
[55:44] William Branham that was just a vessel
[55:47] God chose to use he could have chose
[55:50] somebody else but he chose William
[55:52] Branham but it would he said I was just
[55:54] there when it happened
[55:59] amen the anointing is still here in a
[56:04] fivefold ministry God knew we needed
[56:07] that gift he knew we needed every gift
[56:10] he knows this church needs you
[56:15] hallelujah amen listen you're not just
[56:18] on the sidelines anymore you're on the
[56:20] front lines Amen it's time to pick up
[56:24] your sword and go to fighting this enemy
[56:26] and say I'm not going to stand but some
[56:29] legalism I'm not going to stand for
[56:31] something ology or some Creed
[56:33] I'm not going to stand for some fool
[56:34] cold full of devil but some cold form of
[56:37] worship I am going to stand for truth
[56:40] and righteousness and godliness and
[56:43] holiness amen
[56:47] I've witness he is still among us he is
[56:51] still here he's stealing this over of
[56:54] doubt

[57:12] church was put here for a purpose hey

[1:01:50] I can't believe blessed be the name of
[1:01:56] Lord yeah just a few more minutes if I
[1:02:01] can find out where I'm at for a moment
[1:02:06] he says it was Moses after being in the
[1:02:11] line of his royal seed the seed of
[1:02:13] Abraham he was sent down to Egypt to
[1:02:15] deliver the children of Israel God had
[1:02:18] give him signs and wonders to reform to
[1:02:20] smite the earth and bring forth frogs
[1:02:22] and fleas and darkness and hail and rain
[1:02:24] and fire and done all these miracles and
[1:02:27] then let him by the hand of Jehovah
[1:02:28] there came a time when he met the gate
[1:02:31] between him and the promised land there
[1:02:33] was a Red Sea a bar crossing their way
[1:02:35] they were him to one side by Pharaoh's
[1:02:37] army mountains and desert the Red Sea
[1:02:39] but Moses stepped forth to possess the
[1:02:42] gate of his enemy he crossed the Red Sea
[1:02:45] dry land as he's walking on a dusty road
[1:02:48] he was possessing why because God said
[1:02:52] so makes all the difference in the world
[1:02:55] when God says so but it was only a few
[1:03:00] years later when trials come a few days
[1:03:02] the church got all shook up said so easy
[1:03:06] for a congregation of people to do that
[1:03:08] when something just don't seem to happen
[1:03:11] the way it's supposed to be he said God
[1:03:13] makes it that way listen this this is
[1:03:18] this is going to kind of shake you maybe
[1:03:19] I don't know God brings tensions into
[1:03:23] the church
[1:03:25] every Sun that cometh to God must be
[1:03:27] tried and proven and tested he let's
[1:03:29] sickness strike you
[1:03:30] he lets diseases come on you to test you
[1:03:33] to prove you to show the world that you
[1:03:36] are truly the seed of Abraham he permits
[1:03:40] it by his own will he permits disaster
[1:03:42] he permits friends to turn against you
[1:03:44] he permits all these things he turns the
[1:03:46] devil loose to tempt you and he'll do it
[1:03:48] all but take your life he could throw
[1:03:50] you on a bed of affliction he could turn
[1:03:52] the neighbors against you he can turn
[1:03:54] the church against you he can do almost
[1:03:55] anything it's God's will for him to do
[1:03:58] it we're taught that it's more precious
[1:04:00] to us than gold brother Danny del mundo
[1:04:07] just spoke a wonderful service on the
[1:04:10] making of a bride and he took it out of
[1:04:12] Jo Jo you read the first chapter of Job
[1:04:15] and see all the destruction and all the
[1:04:17] loss that he took but then you can go
[1:04:19] down to the end of Jo and see how it was
[1:04:22] restored double and in the middle job
[1:04:27] made the declaration though God slayed
[1:04:29] me I'm gonna trust him and he made the
[1:04:32] Decorah here he made the declaration it
[1:04:34] said amen the Lord knoweth the way I
[1:04:36] take and then I'll come as out as pure
[1:04:38] gold he said sometimes we're so
[1:04:41] concerned about what's going on in the
[1:04:43] middle of it he said but we need to
[1:04:45] start looking at the end hey man if the
[1:04:50] children of Israel would have done that
[1:04:52] God said I'm going to take you out of
[1:04:54] Egypt and I'm going to take you into a
[1:04:55] land flowing with milk and honey he
[1:04:57] never mentioned one word about the Red
[1:04:59] Sea never said nothing about the desert
[1:05:02] never didn't say anything about them
[1:05:03] maybe hungry or thirsty or drier didn't
[1:05:06] say nothing about any of that he just
[1:05:09] said I'm gonna take you out and I'm
[1:05:10] gonna take it in that should have been
[1:05:12] enough because God had it already taken
[1:05:18] care of the Red Sea was taken care of he
[1:05:21] already had a rock in the wilderness he
[1:05:23] already had plenty of food supplied he
[1:05:25] already had it taken care of but what
[1:05:26] happened they got their eyes on the
[1:05:28] middle and forgot who he was at the
[1:05:31] beginning and what he said he was going
[1:05:33] to be at the end come on somebody
[1:05:40] he said to you I'll take you out of your
[1:05:44] sins or your Creed's and your dogmas and
[1:05:46] I'm gonna take you in he don't mention
[1:05:49] on what happens in between but he's
[1:05:51] already got the answer for it
[1:05:53] God's not concerned he's not threatened
[1:05:58] he he's never had the thought of worry
[1:06:02] how is it going to happen how am I gonna
[1:06:04] get a bride without spot with her
[1:06:06] he said I'll have a bride without spot
[1:06:09] without wrinkle he says what about
[1:06:14] Abraham and Isaac on the mountain the
[1:06:16] one promise was given by his loyalty
[1:06:18] knowing his faith in Jehovah is through
[1:06:19] that and that along God looked down and
[1:06:21] said his seed shall possess the gates I
[1:06:23] swore by myself that I'll do these
[1:06:25] things there's no one greater he could
[1:06:27] swear by himself but he saw swear by so
[1:06:29] he swore by himself then he let Abraham
[1:06:31] be tested to that final place he's got
[1:06:34] to test you and me for that final moment
[1:06:36] at time of decision when everything is
[1:06:38] away from you you have to stand alone
[1:06:41] there but hallelujah he says stand alone
[1:06:44] walk out there and say though God slay
[1:06:46] me yet I'll trust him that is the seed
[1:06:49] of Abraham these the one who gave the
[1:06:52] promise no matter what the rest of
[1:06:53] themselves says what the rest of them do
[1:06:56] ask for me in my house we're gonna serve
[1:06:59] the Lord if the rest of them says
[1:07:01] there's nothing to experience it's a
[1:07:03] bunch of excitement for me in my house
[1:07:06] we're going to serve the Lord he's not
[1:07:09] like to take a word Paul right there sit
[1:07:11] in the way that's called heresy so
[1:07:12] worship I the God of our fathers though
[1:07:15] there be tattlers come in the church
[1:07:17] though there be twisters there will be
[1:07:19] all kinds of false prophets and
[1:07:20] everything come among the churches and
[1:07:22] the people of God in the neighborhood
[1:07:24] but for me and my house we're going to
[1:07:27] serve the Lord though all of them quit
[1:07:29] coming though the church gets cold and
[1:07:31] indifferent for me and my house we're
[1:07:34] going to serve the Lord though if
[1:07:36] somebody was prayed for and didn't get
[1:07:38] well has nothing to do with it as for me
[1:07:41] in my house we're going to serve the
[1:07:43] Lord amen God said so men's not
[1:07:47] malleable but god is man get your you
[1:07:50] got to get your mind you get your mind
[1:07:51] on the man he'll make a mistake
[1:07:53] maybe not willfully better do it God
[1:07:55] will let him have it he'll shake your
[1:07:57] faith away from Mama premier but our
[1:07:59] faith is not in the wisdom of man but in
[1:08:02] the power of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:08:04] Christ that was a true seed of Abraham
[1:08:07] rests their promise a man he said when
[1:08:09] the spies came back said oh you know
[1:08:11] that's foolish to go down there
[1:08:12] there's no need of going there they got
[1:08:14] great Giants they got great dish they
[1:08:16] got great walls for grasshoppers but he
[1:08:19] said it was Joshua he said he was a
[1:08:21] little bitty runt tiny fella but he see
[1:08:24] I've seen him jump up on a box and say
[1:08:26] men and brother to those two million
[1:08:28] people what more than able we're not
[1:08:32] just able we're more than able that why
[1:08:36] because God gave the promise it was
[1:08:40] their possession God gave it to him it
[1:08:43] didn't matter what the opposition was
[1:08:47] lelou you and he says there you stand
[1:08:51] today there stands the Church of the
[1:08:56] Living God I don't care what anyone says
[1:09:00] what the doctor says what anything says
[1:09:03] what the unbeliever says we are more
[1:09:07] than a match for anything that comes
[1:09:10] along whew that's a direct quote from
[1:09:15] the prophet of God we're more than a
[1:09:17] match for anything that comes along
[1:09:20] we're Abraham's seed no matter who the
[1:09:23] enemy is God gave the promised healing
[1:09:27] is your possession salvation is your
[1:09:29] possession the Holy Ghost is your
[1:09:31] possession
[1:09:32] thousands of preachers may come and say
[1:09:34] it ain't so but the seed of Abraham says
[1:09:36] it's so God said they could have it they
[1:09:41] believed it because it was a promise
[1:09:43] Joshua stood there into the little fella
[1:09:45] I don't care how big they are I don't
[1:09:47] care how bad they are I don't care what
[1:09:50] kind of spear they got I don't care how
[1:09:52] high their cities are whoa God gave it
[1:09:54] to us
[1:09:56] he dissolved Joshua's doubts Joshua had
[1:09:59] seen enough
[1:10:00] I believe mercy how much did they need
[1:10:05] to see to believe he tried in his heart
[1:10:11] their doubts plagues destroyed Egypt
[1:10:15] they don't need you've gathered up what
[1:10:17] they had left and come after he
[1:10:18] destroyed the rest of them then there's
[1:10:21] a rock that follows I mean time they
[1:10:22] needed a drink
[1:10:23] there was a rock gushers of water food
[1:10:26] in the wilderness the shoes never wore
[1:10:29] out their clothes didn't worth that
[1:10:31] wasn't a sick one among them how much
[1:10:37] did they need to see to believe
[1:10:40] and I asked you the same thing how much
[1:10:44] do you need to see to believe
[1:10:54] cedar Abraham doesn't look at anything
[1:10:56] natural they look at the promise God
[1:10:59] gave it I believe it all those men were
[1:11:08] great men down through the Bible but
[1:11:12] they died and right in the fire line but
[1:11:15] finally one day in Bethlehem of Judah
[1:11:18] the royal seed was born all the rest of
[1:11:23] them were just shadows foretelling but
[1:11:24] now here comes the fulfillment the royal
[1:11:28] sea born by a virgin with the power in
[1:11:31] his veins to conquer death and hail God
[1:11:34] made a promise
[1:11:35] an ordinary man couldn't do it but if
[1:11:38] God makes a promise he's bound to it and
[1:11:41] said how are we going to do it Joshua
[1:11:43] died Moses died all of them died God
[1:11:45] said he shall possess the gate of his
[1:11:47] enemy therefore if God said it he has to
[1:11:50] provide a way to prove it to bring it to
[1:11:53] pass the royal sea was born he was
[1:11:56] tempted in every manner like we were
[1:11:57] just as you have to be tempted the devil
[1:12:00] taking him spitting in his face ripping
[1:12:03] his beard out on a cross crucified and
[1:12:08] here he died
[1:12:10] in the middle of it all
[1:12:12] he didn't Rob back he held his peace and
[1:12:15] he died today is brother Branham said he
[1:12:20] died too the Sun got ashamed of it of
[1:12:22] itself nature got ashamed and failed to
[1:12:26] operate properly anymore
[1:12:28] the Sun went down in the middle of the
[1:12:30] day the stars wouldn't come out he died
[1:12:32] into the elements was so black and I
[1:12:36] could he said I can imagine nature said
[1:12:38] let me die with him brother than the
[1:12:42] devil sent his precious sold at the
[1:12:43] bottom pits of Hell there the gates open
[1:12:46] he came out on the third day and
[1:12:48] conquered it his seed shall possess the
[1:12:51] gate of his enemy he conquered death he
[1:12:55] conquered hell he conquered the gave
[1:12:57] grave and he's more than conquerors
[1:12:59] through him who loved us oh the day of
[1:13:02] Pentecost he sent that power back to
[1:13:04] those who believe the baptism the Holy
[1:13:07] Ghost to bring them into the promise and
[1:13:09] now we have the right to conquer every
[1:13:11] sickness oh we can shout about that but
[1:13:16] he said we don't even have to conquer it
[1:13:18] it's already conquered we just have to
[1:13:22] claim the promise and go take it it's
[1:13:24] already been delivered to you yes as
[1:13:27] conquered hell is come sicknesses

[1:53:08] special day from the beginning to the
[1:53:10] end our hearts have been blessed amen
[1:53:16] amen
[1:53:17] now why don't we give brother Timothy
[1:53:19] and his family a hand clap pissy
[1:53:43] then Jesus came then Jesus came a man
[1:53:50] what a wonderful God and to think this
[1:53:56] is the prelude my Jesus I don't know
[1:54:02] about you but I'd say if 2020 rolls
[1:54:05] around
[1:54:06] I'd say Labor Day meetings next year
[1:54:09] gonna be over-the-top I can't wait to
[1:54:12] get to this one but you know I was I was
[1:54:17] with our young people this past week as
[1:54:19] we were practicing songs of worship here
[1:54:22] at my house and I had all of the young
[1:54:25] people begin to go around and tell about
[1:54:27] what their expectations were for the
[1:54:29] meeting and there were several that were
[1:54:32] saying you know it feels like we're
[1:54:34] we're just on we're on the climax of
[1:54:36] something the services keep building up
[1:54:38] and building up and sister Katie Grimm's
[1:54:41] words were to that they've been building
[1:54:44] up so much that it feels like we're on
[1:54:45] the cusp of a great breakthrough
[1:54:48] I believe the breakthrough started this
[1:54:51] evening I believe it started this
[1:54:54] weekend I believe that I believe that
[1:54:56] there are Eagles that are hatching out
[1:54:59] that are flying above all of their
[1:55:01] doubts and all of their fears hallelujah
[1:55:06] what a God that we serve we are under
[1:55:09] great expectation from a Living God to
[1:55:12] come one more time we want to be praying
[1:55:15] for the upcoming meetings and the things
[1:55:17] that are in store and so we want to
[1:55:21] dismiss all of the cysts or all those
[1:55:23] other brothers at this time but sister
[1:55:25] Connie would like to meet with all of
[1:55:27] the sisters just for a few moments so as
[1:55:30] the brothers will dismiss you this
[1:55:32] evening and the brothers are dismissed
[1:55:34] so the sister will stay just for a few
[1:55:37] moments and then I'd like to speak with
[1:55:39] the musicians after that
[1:55:41] hey man god bless you in the name of the
[1:55:43] Lord Jesus
