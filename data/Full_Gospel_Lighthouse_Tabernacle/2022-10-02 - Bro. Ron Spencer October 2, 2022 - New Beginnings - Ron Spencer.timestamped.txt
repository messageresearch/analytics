[48:22] account not myself to have apprehended
[48:27] but this one thing that I do
[48:30] forgetting those things which are behind
[48:35] and reaching forth unto those things
[48:37] which are before I pressed toward the
[48:41] mark for the prize of the High Calling
[48:45] of God in Christ Jesus
[48:48] whether you plan to be baptized or not
[48:51] be baptized today I want you to read
[48:53] this part with me forgetting those
[48:56] things which are behind
[48:59] reaching forth unto those things which
[49:02] are before I press towards the mark of
[49:06] the prize of the High Calling of God in
[49:10] Christ Jesus you may be seated this
[49:12] evening
[49:20] there was a noble King
[49:24] he was such a great lover had these
[49:27] subjects till one day before his guard
[49:30] and his royalty he said today
[49:34] you will see me for your last time for
[49:37] many years
[49:38] and his garden is Noble said to him a
[49:41] good King why do you say that are you
[49:45] going to a foreign country somewhere to
[49:47] become an alien
[49:49] no
[49:50] I'm staying right here
[49:54] I'm going out amongst my subjects
[49:56] I'm going to become a peasant
[50:00] I'm going to cut wood with the wood
[50:02] Chopper I'm going to till the ground
[50:04] with the taller I'm going to prune the
[50:07] vines with those who bring prune The
[50:10] Vines I'm going to be one with them in
[50:13] order to get a better acquainted with
[50:16] what they are doing
[50:18] I love them
[50:19] and I want to be more acquainted with
[50:22] them personally they don't know me
[50:25] but yet I want to be acquainted with
[50:28] them in that way
[50:30] and the next morning when the his
[50:32] delegates all of these people seen him
[50:34] the ones that was in the palace take off
[50:37] his crown and lay it down it upon his
[50:40] seed in the throne and take his robe off
[50:43] and put on peasants clothes and walk out
[50:46] amongst the common people
[50:48] now in that little story we found out
[50:51] then about God
[50:54] they said to the king king we want you
[50:57] we love you we want you to remain King
[51:01] but he said I want to become one of them
[51:04] to know them better
[51:08] and they would know him better
[51:10] really was he was
[51:14] how he would display himself
[51:16] I'd write
[51:18] he really was
[51:21] that's what God did
[51:23] he changed himself from being Jehovah
[51:26] God to become one of us that he might
[51:30] suffer and he might taste death that he
[51:32] might know what the sting of death was
[51:36] and to take the penalty of death upon
[51:39] himself and he laid aside his crown in
[51:42] his robe and became one of us he washed
[51:45] feet with the lowly
[51:47] he dwelt in tents with the poor he slept
[51:51] in the woods in the streets and those
[51:53] who were underprivileged he became one
[51:57] of us
[51:58] that he might understand us better and
[52:02] that we might understand him better
[52:07] you say well brother Ron that was 2 000
[52:09] years ago what your experiencing today
[52:12] in her Services is God is Among Us
[52:16] he is with Housewives taking care of
[52:19] babies he's with husbands struggling to
[52:22] make a living he's with ministers and
[52:25] song leaders and musicians and and all
[52:28] of us that clap her hands and Worship
[52:30] the Lord listen to the word of God he
[52:33] wants to live in your life
[52:36] he's not 10 million miles away but he
[52:40] wants to live
[52:44] he wants not not to be a foreign King to
[52:47] you he wants to live in your life
[52:52] oh now let me just say this to you
[52:55] well brother Ron I want more of God well
[52:57] we're the one as human beings that are
[53:00] the one that hold the brakes on God
[53:03] because God wants to consume our life
[53:07] to so fill our lives
[53:09] brother Branham would use the terms so
[53:12] completely surrender ourselves to him
[53:15] until the devil don't know what to do
[53:17] with us
[53:19] he would use the term say completely
[53:22] enter ourself out
[53:25] yeah
[53:26] completely empty ourself out and let him
[53:31] fill us up
[53:32] with his life
[53:36] our purpose and our mission today
[53:41] is to get ourselves closer to God
[53:45] to re-examine where we're at
[53:48] the Readiness of the Bride
[53:51] for the bride will leave in the moment
[53:53] in the twinkling of an eye
[53:55] when the Rapture happens that's not
[53:58] going to be a change of nature that's
[54:01] going to happen here
[54:05] if you're a liar here you're going to be
[54:07] a liar somewhere else if you're a drunk
[54:09] here you're only reflecting where you
[54:11] came from so in this realm in this
[54:15] Mortal realm it's the place that you've
[54:18] got to get everything right
[54:21] now listen don't wait on another
[54:24] this is an individual walk God Saves
[54:28] Israel as a nation but he saves Gentiles
[54:31] as individuals
[54:33] so don't blame another
[54:40] don't wait on another
[54:46] in no way am I attempting to
[54:49] de-christianize anybody
[54:51] I'm not trying to throw a stone at
[54:53] anybody
[54:55] I'm trying to motivate you
[54:58] to rekindle the fire in your life
[55:02] to trim your lamps that it would be
[55:04] brighter than ever before to check up to
[55:07] make sure that everything is right
[55:11] sometimes as people we just don't start
[55:13] off right
[55:17] we get entangled in circumstances and
[55:20] influences of life that come in through
[55:23] the decades of serving the lord and
[55:26] we get stuff in our life
[55:29] Petty feelings in her life Petty
[55:32] jealousies in her life
[55:34] we look at others let me just say never
[55:37] lose your focus on keeping it on Jesus
[55:41] Christ
[55:47] my brother on this Minister did this to
[55:49] me and this man failed me and this one
[55:51] I'm sorry I apologize to him as I start
[55:54] I apologize for others failures where
[55:57] they misplaced you but don't bundle us
[56:00] all up together
[56:03] just because we've had a lot of nonsense
[56:06] don't bottle us all up in the same
[56:08] package there's going to be some real
[56:10] men of God there's going to be some real
[56:13] leaders that are going to be filled with
[56:16] the Holy Ghost
[56:23] foreign
[56:32] you as a brighter coming to your place
[56:36] you've been here for now quite a long
[56:38] time
[56:39] the appearance of the Lord has been
[56:41] among us but there's coming a coming
[56:44] where we'll see the physical Corporal
[56:47] return of Jesus Christ we'll see the
[56:50] resurrected debt
[56:55] we're trimming our lats maybe for the
[56:57] last time
[56:59] as a minister when God began to speak to
[57:02] me on this subject
[57:05] I I be honest with you I had to I had to
[57:08] stop and spend much time and prayer
[57:12] because if God is calling for a higher
[57:14] calling I think he's also expecting that
[57:17] of the ministry
[57:19] before you can present it to an audience
[57:21] you must be there for yourself
[57:24] but as we look around the world we see
[57:27] tragedies happen natural tragedies to
[57:30] our nation
[57:31] we see America in its moral condition
[57:36] Insanity no matter what party that you
[57:39] join let me just say insanity is
[57:42] everywhere our courthouses don't know
[57:45] how to rule
[57:47] our nation don't know how to vote
[57:52] Hollywood don't know what to do with all
[57:55] of what's going on
[57:59] Sodom and Gomorrah was at your local
[58:01] McDonald's and and Walmart it's
[58:04] everywhere
[58:05] it is permeated the atmosphere
[58:09] this is no world to stay in
[58:17] Russia I believe it was on Wednesday
[58:21] made their huge announcements that they
[58:24] have now
[58:24] taken in several different
[58:27] ah
[58:29] lands in Ukraine now it's a part of
[58:32] their own and
[58:34] now saying that they will use nuclear
[58:38] weapons
[58:39] even against the West
[58:41] we knew these things were coming
[58:44] this was not a shock wave that's come
[58:46] our way that Almighty we better get
[58:49] ready we've been getting ready for a
[58:50] long time
[58:53] we've been getting ready we had
[58:55] tomorrow's newspaper a long time ago we
[58:58] had a prophet
[59:00] and whether the America or the world
[59:03] wanted to recognize Malachi 4 5-6 we had
[59:08] a prophet to stand here and tell us what
[59:11] was going to happen this week next week
[59:14] the weeks after
[59:17] it's our job to step to our position and
[59:21] be ready
[59:23] the pope is doing what he's doing
[59:25] Britain is doing what it's doing we're
[59:27] all leaders are doing what they're doing
[59:30] Israel has the red heifers now
[59:33] they're preparing they can't they can't
[59:36] go forward until two prophets come two
[59:39] prophets can't come until you as a bride
[59:41] leave the Earth
[59:43] but Moses and Elijah will come
[59:47] and the bride will leave the Earth
[59:50] and the tribulation period will happen
[59:53] [Applause]
[59:55] your neighbors will miss you
[59:59] what happened to them they must have
[1:00:01] moved away
[1:00:02] they must have taken another job Life
[1:00:05] Will Go On The World will just get
[1:00:08] darker and darker and darker and darker
[1:00:13] but Israel there will be light
[1:00:17] and they will hear a message of the hour
[1:00:19] brother Branham could not preach the
[1:00:21] trumpets because the trumpets would be
[1:00:24] coming to to them through the prophets
[1:00:26] of that day
[1:00:27] we would get our message
[1:00:30] because we heard it
[1:00:32] and the reason we could hear it was with
[1:00:35] a predestinated seed that was on the
[1:00:38] inside of us we couldn't make ourselves
[1:00:41] seed we were already seen to start off
[1:00:45] with
[1:00:46] and the reason it sounds so good to us
[1:00:49] it sounds like home
[1:00:53] [Music]
[1:00:55] [Applause]
[1:01:03] Hallelujah
[1:01:05] Paul would say it like this Romans
[1:01:08] chapter 12 and verse 1 I beseech you
[1:01:11] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[1:01:13] that you present your bodies
[1:01:18] a Living Sacrifice
[1:01:21] holy and acceptable unto God which is
[1:01:24] your reasonable service
[1:01:26] I may not conformed to this world but
[1:01:29] may you transformed by the renewing of
[1:01:33] your mind that you may be able to prove
[1:01:36] what is the good and acceptable and the
[1:01:40] perfect will of God
[1:01:44] the scripture tells us as a man think us
[1:01:47] in his heart so is he
[1:01:49] if you're defeated so you will be
[1:01:55] but brother Ron I get so much resistance
[1:01:58] in my life let me just say expect
[1:02:01] resistance
[1:02:03] expect to Fight for Your Life
[1:02:08] let me give you a natural example
[1:02:10] sometimes we have to reinvent ourselves
[1:02:15] a man named Colonel Sanders at 65 years
[1:02:19] old there was a an incredible Interstate
[1:02:23] that went by his way they did not put an
[1:02:26] exit ramp near him and so he was going
[1:02:30] bankrupt so he began to put his Fried
[1:02:33] Chicken in the back in the back of of
[1:02:36] his old station wagon and take it to be
[1:02:39] sold at local places the rest is history
[1:02:44] bankrupt at 65 but he didn't set accept
[1:02:47] defeat
[1:02:50] by Ada he had traveled the world he had
[1:02:53] been knighted in a lot of places he had
[1:02:56] been recognized among Kings as one of
[1:02:58] the most recognizable men in the world
[1:03:02] 88 years old to pass away a
[1:03:06] multi-million dollar Legend
[1:03:11] Glenn Cunningham was burned as a boy
[1:03:15] burned and his stay actually one to
[1:03:17] amputate his legs and take his legs off
[1:03:21] of him and and he said absolutely don't
[1:03:23] take my legs off and and you know he
[1:03:26] would he would he had gotten burned and
[1:03:28] he would roll himself out in a
[1:03:31] wheelchair and roll out into the yard
[1:03:33] and he would sit there and watch all the
[1:03:35] other children go by and you know he
[1:03:38] could have accepted sitting in that
[1:03:39] wheelchair the rest of his life but one
[1:03:42] day he pulled himself up
[1:03:44] that's what I want you to do this
[1:03:47] morning pull yourself up
[1:03:53] one day he pulled himself up and said
[1:03:57] I'm not gonna sit here no more feeling
[1:04:00] sorry for myself I'm not going to have a
[1:04:03] pity party for myself I'm gonna pull
[1:04:05] myself up I'm going to stand as long as
[1:04:09] I can stand
[1:04:19] he turned it he started taking step
[1:04:22] after step after step after step
[1:04:25] One Step led to another step another
[1:04:28] step led to another step
[1:04:34] and before long he was running
[1:04:38] Glenn Cunningham became the first four
[1:04:42] minute miler
[1:04:47] sometimes your tests may be more than
[1:04:50] you can stand
[1:04:53] right
[1:04:55] but it's no time to have a pity party
[1:04:58] [Applause]
[1:05:00] you've got to press
[1:05:03] don't look at the circumstances around
[1:05:06] you God is greater than your
[1:05:09] circumstances he's greater than your
[1:05:12] cancer he's greater than what the
[1:05:14] doctors are telling you God's greater
[1:05:18] [Applause]
[1:05:25] in the words of Jesus
[1:05:28] he said then this the shelter chapter 25
[1:05:31] of Matthew verse 1. then shall the
[1:05:34] Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten
[1:05:37] virgins
[1:05:38] which took their lamps
[1:05:40] and went forth to meet the bridegroom
[1:05:43] five of them were wise and five were
[1:05:45] foolish
[1:05:47] and they that were foolish took their
[1:05:48] lamps and took no all with them but the
[1:05:50] wise took all in their vessels
[1:05:53] which is the Holy Ghost and
[1:05:56] and while the bridegroom bridegroom
[1:05:59] tarried
[1:06:00] they all slumbered and slept
[1:06:03] and at midnight there was a crime made
[1:06:06] behold the bridegroom cometh go you out
[1:06:09] to meet him and all those virgins arose
[1:06:12] and trimmed their lamps
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:17] and the foolish said unto the wise give
[1:06:20] us of your awe
[1:06:23] for our lamps
[1:06:25] are gone out
[1:06:29] God don't move in our church no more
[1:06:32] we don't see the mother of God move
[1:06:38] I don't care what denomination is if
[1:06:40] God's not moving you there's people
[1:06:44] don't dress right
[1:06:49] and you've got a compromise they're
[1:06:51] standing in the Pulpit a politician
[1:06:55] he's not only selling his soul he's
[1:06:57] selling yours
[1:07:00] brother Branham said at the Judgment
[1:07:03] there will be a lot of disappointments
[1:07:05] he said the drunk won't be disappointed
[1:07:08] The Prostitute won't be disappointed but
[1:07:11] people that have put their trust in a
[1:07:13] system
[1:07:16] they're going to be disappointed
[1:07:19] I don't want to be disappointed
[1:07:28] for Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 1.
[1:07:32] we know that this is immediately
[1:07:34] following the Rapture chapter
[1:07:37] but of the times of the Season brethren
[1:07:40] you have no need that are right unto you
[1:07:42] for yourselves know perfectly
[1:07:44] that the day of the Lord is at the thief
[1:07:47] in the night
[1:07:49] and when they shall say peace and safety
[1:07:51] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[1:07:56] as travail upon a woman with a child
[1:08:01] sister Gabriel is not here this morning
[1:08:03] but she knows what travail
[1:08:08] is like right now she's having
[1:08:12] contractions
[1:08:13] because there's a child
[1:08:17] that's being forced
[1:08:20] from that comfortable place
[1:08:25] don't know what it's going to get into
[1:08:27] but there's a nature that's forcing that
[1:08:31] baby
[1:08:33] that baby can hear the heartbeat that
[1:08:35] baby can that is nourished by the mama
[1:08:38] but it's getting ready to be pushed into
[1:08:40] a new life
[1:08:44] this world is not our home
[1:08:48] don't get comfortable here
[1:08:52] it's good to have houses and homes or
[1:08:54] tents or whatever you got but let me
[1:08:56] just say don't get comfortable here
[1:08:59] don't get comfortable with this flesh
[1:09:02] there's a new body that's waiting on us
[1:09:06] it's a better land
[1:09:11] there's no murders there's no sickness
[1:09:14] there's no hospitals there's no
[1:09:16] disappointments there's not a time clock
[1:09:20] nobody does
[1:09:22] [Applause]
[1:09:26] no nursing homes
[1:09:29] no Undertakers now
[1:09:32] no winter no fall seasons
[1:09:49] Peter stood up on the day of
[1:09:51] inauguration Acts chapter 2.
[1:09:54] Andrew spoke about last night David and
[1:09:58] Moses and Daniel long to have the
[1:10:02] presence of God in them
[1:10:04] the anointing of God would come down on
[1:10:07] them
[1:10:08] and they would feel God
[1:10:11] they would feel God even at times see
[1:10:13] God even see the effects of God
[1:10:19] but Daniel knew Daniel
[1:10:21] Moses knew down Moses
[1:10:24] David knew David
[1:10:26] they knew their mistakes and they knew
[1:10:29] their failures but they longed for a day
[1:10:34] where the god of Heaven that had walked
[1:10:37] with them would one day live on the
[1:10:40] inside of them
[1:10:42] that's what God wants to do to you he
[1:10:45] don't want to just walk with you
[1:10:49] he don't want us not want just a church
[1:10:51] relationship with you he wants to live
[1:10:54] on the throne room of your heart
[1:11:00] now let's just remember
[1:11:02] there were some days that Peter was
[1:11:05] naked
[1:11:06] causing
[1:11:09] and Jesus picked him
[1:11:11] there were some days that you was a lot
[1:11:14] of stuff
[1:11:19] so hang your wings
[1:11:24] [Music]
[1:11:28] well brother Ron I don't need Jesus
[1:11:30] prepare for help
[1:11:36] you don't need Jesus prepare for help
[1:11:38] when you're standing at the Judgment
[1:11:40] Jesus said I came by your way by sermons
[1:11:43] my songs my scriptures my poetry my
[1:11:47] books
[1:11:48] I made a way for you and you turned it
[1:11:51] all down so you got to go to hell
[1:11:55] you listen you're the one that sends
[1:11:57] yourself to hell
[1:11:59] don't blame God don't blame preachers
[1:12:05] well I didn't get an education teachers
[1:12:07] must have been dumb
[1:12:20] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[1:12:23] baptized
[1:12:40] stay in the program either stay in the
[1:12:42] program
[1:12:47] Evan
[1:12:49] God knows your name I'll forget it 40
[1:12:52] 000 times but
[1:12:54] you have a good time at Disney
[1:12:57] I'd like to stay there myself
[1:13:00] and then Peter said unto them repent
[1:13:07] repentance is not because you got caught
[1:13:14] yeah
[1:13:15] a lot of these celebrities after they
[1:13:18] get caught
[1:13:20] go to rehab centers
[1:13:23] I now do it they'll do it time and time
[1:13:25] and time and time again they'll get in
[1:13:27] the front of a mic I want you to know
[1:13:29] about wife I'm so sorry
[1:13:32] there was a moment it was a trap
[1:13:37] they go to the pope and repent they'll
[1:13:39] go to their favorite preacher repent
[1:13:41] only to repeat the process but when you
[1:13:44] truly repent
[1:13:46] come on somebody help me preach this
[1:13:48] morning when you truly repent you never
[1:13:51] go back again
[1:14:07] and baptized
[1:14:10] which is my immersion not by sprinkling
[1:14:13] you on the head because your old man is
[1:14:16] dead
[1:14:18] so when I'm when a man dies in The
[1:14:21] Natural we don't take him to the Grave
[1:14:24] pull up a little grass and go
[1:14:26] [Music]
[1:14:29] [Applause]
[1:14:31] there is federal rate of Galatians
[1:14:33] saying you bury him six foot deep
[1:14:38] in our area
[1:14:40] some places they put concrete on them
[1:14:42] but let me just say this to you in true
[1:14:45] baptism
[1:14:51] that word baptism comes from baptismal
[1:14:55] and it is it is the same meaning as
[1:14:59] taking a pickle
[1:15:01] a cucumber and make it in a pickle
[1:15:06] a pickle will never reproduce the
[1:15:10] Cucumber again
[1:15:13] because it's went through a process
[1:15:19] and if you've been truly repented
[1:15:22] and you've been truly filled with the
[1:15:25] Holy Ghost
[1:15:26] God will fill you with the Holy Ghost
[1:15:29] and if you're truly sealed you'll never
[1:15:33] go back to your original estate again
[1:15:46] there's a lot of people get baptized in
[1:15:49] a lot of different names
[1:15:51] but there's only one form
[1:15:54] of true scriptural
[1:15:58] King James Version
[1:16:04] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:08] because this is a form of your marriage
[1:16:13] certificate
[1:16:20] well I don't want to take on his name so
[1:16:22] they'll take on a Church's name
[1:16:26] well you're just his girlfriend
[1:16:32] let's just be honest
[1:16:34] you've only signed your name on a book
[1:16:39] that's no more than becoming a mason
[1:16:43] I'm talking about true conversion I'm
[1:16:46] talking about true scriptural conversion
[1:16:48] brother Ron I want to argue let me just
[1:16:50] say forget your time
[1:16:53] don't waste your time
[1:16:56] you're not arguing with me I didn't
[1:16:59] write the book
[1:17:01] [Applause]
[1:17:18] now notice what it says
[1:17:21] for the remission
[1:17:30] that's not just your sins but that's all
[1:17:32] your father's sins and mother's sins
[1:17:36] because all there's passed down so
[1:17:39] somewhere the Cycle's got to be broken
[1:17:42] well brother Ron in my family we had
[1:17:44] temper if you truly repent
[1:17:47] and you truly are baptized and you truly
[1:17:50] filled with the Holy Ghost there's an
[1:17:52] adoption cycle in that that breaks the
[1:17:55] cycle
[1:17:57] [Applause]
[1:17:59] and the remission revokes the
[1:18:01] jurisdiction of Satan
[1:18:05] we are a slave no longer oh
[1:18:13] for the promises unto you and to you
[1:18:15] children
[1:18:16] I look at my grandbaby sitting here in
[1:18:18] Daughters of the church sitting across
[1:18:20] this audience I am thrilled to see what
[1:18:23] God is producing in this hour
[1:18:26] there are lighthouses to the community
[1:18:29] you're a lighthouse to this community
[1:18:31] for the promises unto you and to your
[1:18:34] children and to all that are far off
[1:18:35] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:18:39] call
[1:18:43] laughs
[1:18:50] now
[1:18:56] there's a there's a mythical
[1:18:58] and I I gotta I gotta use this just for
[1:19:01] an example
[1:19:04] there's a thing called Phoenix
[1:19:07] is something that can rise up
[1:19:11] out of nothing
[1:19:14] we got a lot of phoenixes in this
[1:19:16] building
[1:19:26] we got a lot of faith is this microphone
[1:19:28] working at all we got a lot of phoenixes
[1:19:32] in this building means that something
[1:19:35] has risen from nothing
[1:19:42] because many of you were making choices
[1:19:45] taking you away from God
[1:19:48] and those choices were taking you
[1:19:50] further and further in sin
[1:19:52] and destroying your life but God rich in
[1:19:57] Mercy
[1:19:58] for in his great love he redeemed you
[1:20:01] and he raised you like a phoenix out of
[1:20:04] nothing
[1:20:06] because God saw something in you when
[1:20:10] man said there's nothing there to be had
[1:20:13] [Applause]
[1:20:21] the prophet says that's what God does he
[1:20:23] takes nothing
[1:20:24] and raises it up and makes something out
[1:20:27] of it
[1:20:34] New Life
[1:20:38] I'm absolutely sure today
[1:20:41] I'm positive to today
[1:20:45] that today there's going to be new life
[1:20:48] racing out of Ashes
[1:20:54] I say this reverently
[1:20:58] God spoke to me
[1:21:04] about a renewing
[1:21:07] like a fresh drink for the king
[1:21:11] like a fresh washing
[1:21:16] and it kept coming to me over and over
[1:21:18] and over again
[1:21:22] I spoke it the other day here
[1:21:25] before we left to go to Brother Kelly's
[1:21:27] and it wasn't on the internet
[1:21:29] of how God was dealing for us to have a
[1:21:32] service like today
[1:21:33] of renewing
[1:21:36] New Beginnings from this point
[1:21:38] a fresh start
[1:21:42] a fresh drink for the king
[1:21:45] like a fresh washing
[1:21:49] you know I took I've taken I took a bath
[1:21:51] this morning
[1:21:53] you'd like to say thank you
[1:21:56] for those that will be getting in the
[1:21:58] tub and
[1:21:58] you'd like you don't want to smell me
[1:22:02] but I took a I took a fresh shower this
[1:22:05] morning
[1:22:07] and you know I put soap in my hat
[1:22:10] for those that I put soap in my head and
[1:22:13] and then I put I I put a conditioner in
[1:22:17] there
[1:22:18] sister Heather taught me that
[1:22:22] and then I bathed myself
[1:22:26] was it because I thought I really needed
[1:22:29] it
[1:22:31] because I knew I needed it
[1:22:36] sometimes in life as decades go on
[1:22:40] of serving God
[1:22:43] little things begin to creep
[1:22:48] into our lives and we need a fresh
[1:22:51] washing
[1:22:55] I was driving around at UVA the other
[1:22:58] day after several appointments on
[1:23:00] Tuesday and then on Wednesday and it was
[1:23:02] on Wednesday I had a service laid out
[1:23:05] for Brother Kelly's I thought that was a
[1:23:07] service I prayed I prayed diligently
[1:23:10] about Brother Kelly's meeting and God
[1:23:12] spoke to me the fact that this message
[1:23:16] and it wasn't it didn't go anything like
[1:23:18] this this morning but renewing
[1:23:22] would be the subjects that I would that
[1:23:24] I would speak at Brother Kelly's and as
[1:23:26] I stood at the pulpit with a new sermon
[1:23:29] to preach and God dealing with me
[1:23:32] I just knew that if I did my part god
[1:23:35] would do his
[1:23:37] that's what I know this morning if I do
[1:23:39] my part gotta do his and
[1:23:42] and so as I began to come to the end of
[1:23:44] the service I came down to the end and
[1:23:47] and if I can say this reverently I came
[1:23:49] down to the end and I felt the presence
[1:23:51] on the stage and I turned and as it
[1:23:54] looked like a man standing behind me and
[1:23:56] then it was wave after wave and hundreds
[1:24:00] came to the altar rejoicing begin to
[1:24:03] take place and prayer began to happen
[1:24:05] and rededication rekindling of the flame
[1:24:10] only God can do what he's doing today
[1:24:14] It's Not Just Happening Here it's
[1:24:16] happening all over the world it is
[1:24:18] because God's Gathering his wife and
[1:24:21] getting her ready
[1:24:23] Church we're not from this world
[1:24:28] we're being called to another world
[1:24:31] what Adam stepped out of we're going to
[1:24:34] step into
[1:24:41] I want to be very solemn with you
[1:24:45] foreign
[1:24:46] ly got some names that have come in in
[1:24:49] the last two weeks of people that said I
[1:24:52] just feel like quitting and thank God
[1:24:54] none from here
[1:24:59] but if you feel like quitting this is
[1:25:02] for you
[1:25:03] quitting is not an option
[1:25:22] you can quit football
[1:25:24] man you can quit voting
[1:25:28] you can quit going to the doctor
[1:25:31] you can quit your job
[1:25:34] you can quit loving your wife
[1:25:38] it's because you don't love God
[1:25:40] if you love God you'll always love her
[1:25:46] it's both ways
[1:25:49] but serving God quitting
[1:25:52] is not an option
[1:25:55] so I want to tell you the spirit that's
[1:25:57] telling you to quit is not from God
[1:26:05] why don't you just turn to your neighbor
[1:26:07] and tell them say Quentin that is not an
[1:26:08] option here

[1:27:01] going back to smoking
[1:27:06] doing cocaine
[1:27:12] going to a church where you can wear
[1:27:13] booty shorts
[1:27:20] where your husband sits and lust after
[1:27:22] your neighbor
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:25] going back to pornography as it is
[1:27:37] well brother on I'm too busy to go to
[1:27:39] church what are you busy doing
[1:27:43] [Applause]

[1:27:55] in hell
[1:28:01] well my my clothes my clothes in my
[1:28:04] closet there's not going to be any
[1:28:05] clothes in hell
[1:28:07] you imagine what an ugly Place hell's
[1:28:09] going to be with all them naked ugly
[1:28:11] bodies
[1:28:13] let me just say Marilyn Monroe down
[1:28:15] there don't look like she did uphill
[1:28:17] [Applause]
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:19] [Applause]
[1:28:21] them things that's in Hollywood they
[1:28:23] ain't gonna look the same down there in
[1:28:25] hell
[1:28:27] because they ain't gonna have spies down
[1:28:29] there keeping their body on
[1:28:31] [Applause]
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:35] naked in hell is where they're gonna be
[1:28:41] and there's not going to be one friend
[1:28:44] in Hell there's not going to be no
[1:28:46] parties
[1:28:51] there ain't going to be no God in hell
[1:28:54] [Applause]
[1:29:02] if you do see somebody that you spent
[1:29:04] much time in life and parted with
[1:29:06] they're going to blame you
[1:29:10] for helping them get here
[1:29:13] and they're not going to love you so let
[1:29:15] me just say don't turn down the preacher
[1:29:18] while there's still time while I'm still
[1:29:21] here
[1:29:23] [Applause]
[1:29:56] the same bomb that will bomb Washington
[1:29:59] D.C
[1:30:01] will bomb here
[1:30:07] I'm not saying that because I think it
[1:30:14] I'm saying that because I know it
[1:30:19] because I have carried a classification
[1:30:22] to know that
[1:30:32] so Wednesday's meeting in Russia
[1:30:38] has much significance for America
[1:30:42] this meeting in heaven
[1:30:47] has much significance
[1:30:50] because the quicker we get out of the
[1:30:52] way
[1:30:53] the quicker he can drop his bombs
[1:30:57] [Applause]
[1:31:01] and if he's screaming to drop his bombs
[1:31:07] why not
[1:31:08] say God liken the first Exodus
[1:31:12] Let's cross the Red Sea
[1:31:15] and grab a tambourine
[1:31:22] the God of this world offers nothing but
[1:31:24] destruction
[1:31:26] he offers you a kingdom without a
[1:31:28] Calvary he offers your religion without
[1:31:31] a message
[1:31:32] he offers you a message without a birth
[1:31:36] he offers you preachers with
[1:31:38] intellectual conceptions preaching you
[1:31:40] all different kinds of thoughts and
[1:31:42] opinions even about the message
[1:31:45] but what about men of God that'll preach
[1:31:48] a new birth
[1:31:50] but many want to say well let's get past
[1:31:52] the New Birth really
[1:31:57] it's your adoption
[1:32:00] it should be celebrated
[1:32:04] it should be lived in and rejoice then
[1:32:08] but like John's eyes became filmed over
[1:32:11] even brother Branham wanted to go to the
[1:32:14] mountains and stay but God had to tell
[1:32:16] him I'll leave you
[1:32:19] the pressures of this life
[1:32:22] makes this world so unfit to live in
[1:32:27] we're so uncomfortable
[1:32:35] foreign
[1:32:37] sometimes when I go shopping
[1:32:39] with sister Connie
[1:32:43] she says I'm a better Shopper than her
[1:32:45] because I spend more money
[1:32:49] I walked in a hunting store the other
[1:32:51] day with Adam and he never been a
[1:32:53] diamond I spent a hundred and twelve
[1:32:54] dollars I don't know how that worked out
[1:32:59] but sometimes when you walk into I'm
[1:33:02] sorry sister Connie I did it
[1:33:05] we walk into a score and we just become
[1:33:08] uncomfortable with the atmosphere
[1:33:13] will get weary
[1:33:15] we get overwhelmed I know I'm talking to
[1:33:18] some of you
[1:33:19] and if we're not careful we'll get
[1:33:21] entangled
[1:33:26] I ride through our Woods
[1:33:28] I got a golf cart my grandbabies love to
[1:33:31] ride up through the woods with me
[1:33:34] and when we ride through if my
[1:33:36] windshield's not up spider webs are
[1:33:39] getting my face
[1:33:40] I don't like them
[1:33:42] I'll be the first to tell you that I
[1:33:44] don't like spiders and I don't like
[1:33:46] snakes I don't like mice
[1:33:49] and I don't like hypocrites
[1:33:52] [Applause]
[1:34:05] but so many times circumstances of life
[1:34:08] tangle us
[1:34:11] to worry if you make a mistake today
[1:34:12] tomorrow you know the devil is the kind
[1:34:15] of guy that will stack odds against you
[1:34:17] and he'll get you into a situation and
[1:34:19] your friends will get you in trouble
[1:34:21] listen some of your friends that are so
[1:34:22] close to you will get you in trouble and
[1:34:24] then the devil will come along and he'll
[1:34:26] get another into trouble and then he
[1:34:27] goes and then you can't unload
[1:34:31] I'm coming to an end now
[1:34:33] and sometimes you come to a spot to
[1:34:35] where
[1:34:36] how can I get out of this spot
[1:34:42] now I'm going to be very honest with you
[1:34:46] I was raised in the message
[1:34:48] we listened to a tape
[1:34:50] after tape every day
[1:34:53] by my grandfather and my mother my
[1:34:56] mother and my grandfather my mother and
[1:34:58] my daddy
[1:34:59] excuse me
[1:35:00] how did I get tangled there
[1:35:04] my dad was a was a kind of man that
[1:35:06] would speak in tongues through the night
[1:35:08] and
[1:35:08] real experience of God many of you knew
[1:35:11] him
[1:35:13] but growing up
[1:35:16] growing up in a in a in a home were
[1:35:21] messages taught believed churches every
[1:35:25] week
[1:35:26] don't make you born again
[1:35:30] and I knew the stories and I knew the
[1:35:32] situations and I you know nobody had to
[1:35:35] convince me that God sent a prophet as a
[1:35:38] matter of fact
[1:35:39] one of the worst fights I was ever in
[1:35:42] was in a bar room
[1:35:45] don't tell nobody
[1:35:49] but somebody called brother Branham a
[1:35:51] false prophet Reuben something went
[1:35:54] through me I was I was drunk
[1:35:58] and something went through me
[1:36:02] it didn't end up good
[1:36:05] I may be five foot five but I know how
[1:36:07] to fight
[1:36:09] and listen when you're five foot five
[1:36:11] listen you can't afford to lose
[1:36:15] foreign
[1:36:22] it's like Mike Tyson said Everybody's
[1:36:25] Got A Plan until they get hit in the
[1:36:27] nose
[1:36:31] and I was in a very bad spot
[1:36:35] and I'm talking about a really bad spot
[1:36:38] and I thought there was no way out and
[1:36:40] I'll be honest with you
[1:36:42] brother Fred I thought there was no way
[1:36:44] out
[1:36:45] I knew what was right
[1:36:48] but I thought there was no way out
[1:36:52] well you see there was no way for me to
[1:36:55] get out
[1:36:58] now a lot of people don't want to tell
[1:37:00] you this part of their life
[1:37:02] they want to put on a masquerade
[1:37:05] show you the now but let me take you
[1:37:08] back
[1:37:12] when I was a boy when something like
[1:37:14] where some of you are and some of you
[1:37:15] are on the internet
[1:37:16] let me say you can't get yourself out
[1:37:19] but what I'm presenting to you is a
[1:37:22] Jesus
[1:37:22] [Applause]
[1:37:27] and he spoke to me on a certain night
[1:37:30] and he said Ron are you ready to come
[1:37:34] home
[1:37:36] and I remembered the prodigals Sun story
[1:37:39] and I repeated back to him God I can't
[1:37:42] get out but you got to help me get out
[1:37:46] the next morning there was a knock on
[1:37:48] the door with garbage bags
[1:37:53] and it was my unconverted uncle standing
[1:37:56] there and he said Ron it's time to go
[1:38:00] home
[1:38:00] [Music]
[1:38:12] the rest is history
[1:38:16] it didn't happen overnight but the rest
[1:38:19] is history
[1:38:23] I call Sister Connie
[1:38:27] I said Connie you haven't seen me in 18
[1:38:29] months and I've been a really bad boy
[1:38:33] and you have every right in the world to
[1:38:35] hate me your daddy your mama your church
[1:38:38] has every right to hate me little did I
[1:38:40] know I'd be preaching to you now
[1:38:42] 23 years as a pastor
[1:38:57] isn't God wonderful
[1:39:00] Kenny ain't God good
[1:39:12] I said I'm going to get baptized it had
[1:39:15] flooded
[1:39:17] and said you're sure you want to get
[1:39:19] baptized I said this can't wait
[1:39:23] River's muddy anyway just can't wait
[1:39:27] I told Connie I said would you would you
[1:39:29] come I drove I drove here
[1:39:33] they lived in the big house
[1:39:35] I picked her up
[1:39:37] we hardly said a word all the way up the
[1:39:40] road matter of fact she didn't want to
[1:39:42] talk to me and I didn't know what to say
[1:39:43] to her
[1:39:47] she really didn't want to talk to me
[1:39:50] and I understood she'd been hurt
[1:39:54] that's what hurt people do they get hurt
[1:40:00] Terry Horn
[1:40:02] we baptized I wore our Old Yeller
[1:40:05] pullover
[1:40:08] now walk down in that watery grave I'm
[1:40:11] scared plumbed to the death of water
[1:40:14] and I walked down into that watery grave
[1:40:16] and it was up to my chest
[1:40:18] and I looked at Terry and I said don't
[1:40:20] lose me
[1:40:26] honestly I told him that don't lose me
[1:40:34] I don't know what happened but somewhere
[1:40:36] between going down
[1:40:38] and coming up
[1:40:41] something happened
[1:40:45] there's a lot of things about the new
[1:40:47] birth I can't explain
[1:40:49] but I can tell you when you meet Jesus
[1:40:52] Cara
[1:40:53] everything's different
[1:40:59] brother Terry Horn we went to the church
[1:41:01] to change her clothes
[1:41:03] and brother Terry Horn reached up in the
[1:41:05] tape library and he pulled out a tape
[1:41:07] called
[1:41:08] choosing of a bride
[1:41:11] he said I noticed you two aren't talking
[1:41:17] but maybe
[1:41:19] maybe you'd like to listen to this on
[1:41:22] your way down the road
[1:41:24] so instead of Connie and Ronald talking
[1:41:27] brother Branham talked for two hours
[1:41:30] on choosing of a bride
[1:41:33] and of course said you've heard it and
[1:41:34] I'll just repeat some of this God's
[1:41:37] looking for somebody that will reflect
[1:41:40] his character
[1:41:42] he's not looking for a church that wants
[1:41:45] to fit theirs
[1:41:47] because God wants to become the king of
[1:41:50] your heart
[1:41:52] and he wants a bride that will dress
[1:41:55] like him and talk like him and walk like
[1:41:58] him and live like him and
[1:42:03] you know we went to service that night
[1:42:06] and if I remember right
[1:42:08] I was I was sitting beside of you I got
[1:42:10] to sit beside of you
[1:42:12] and
[1:42:14] and I set beside of her in church and I
[1:42:17] think we sat with the Linda team
[1:42:21] Linda Hinkle and Linda Kelly
[1:42:27] and
[1:42:30] I'll never forget this Linda Kelly said
[1:42:32] I look like Tom Selleck
[1:42:41] I never saw that in the mirror
[1:42:48] now I'm honored to look like Teddy
[1:42:50] Roosevelt but I never have saw Tom's
[1:42:53] self
[1:42:58] and I sit there very confused
[1:43:01] in a few weeks my life has changed and
[1:43:05] I don't know what to do with my life
[1:43:09] what's going to happen with my life
[1:43:12] maybe like you sitting here this morning
[1:43:14] in New Beginnings okay where do I go
[1:43:17] from here
[1:43:18] yeah New Beginnings is a start over
[1:43:23] maybe a closet has to be rearranged and
[1:43:26] your music has to be rearranged but
[1:43:29] don't worry God will take care of that
[1:43:31] and you're lying and you're cheating and
[1:43:33] you're and you're lusting in your porn
[1:43:35] habits and all of those things have to
[1:43:38] be rearranged in your life and God's
[1:43:41] rich in Mercy
[1:43:48] Hallelujah
[1:43:50] [Applause]
[1:43:56] I think this is October the 2nd
[1:44:04] so for today
[1:44:07] for that Joe that those of you that want
[1:44:09] a new beginning
[1:44:12] I'd like for you to mark this on your
[1:44:14] calendar
[1:44:18] in the Old Testament they would they
[1:44:20] would build an altar where they met God
[1:44:23] now I'm not being Christian now as
[1:44:25] you've said here for 30 years I I'm not
[1:44:27] de-christianizing your walk but maybe
[1:44:29] you just want to step closer
[1:44:34] you know you I don't live with you you
[1:44:36] know you
[1:44:37] I I'm not going to try to discern you so
[1:44:40] many times people want you to discern
[1:44:42] them you know you
[1:44:44] you know your name you know your address
[1:44:45] you know your situations
[1:44:47] but you know
[1:44:49] that you need more of Jesus
[1:44:52] no matter where you're at in the world
[1:44:53] and you hear this sermon
[1:44:55] and there's a renewal for you
[1:44:58] and God's asking one more time
[1:45:00] I don't know how many more times that
[1:45:02] we'll have to do this but
[1:45:06] I'll never forget this and let me just
[1:45:08] share this one more thing
[1:45:09] my brother that is now a pastor
[1:45:14] I remember I'll never forget walking up
[1:45:16] to him and he said
[1:45:19] I said Mark don't waste another day
[1:45:23] and he said but I've got so many excuses
[1:45:25] I said tell me one that's worth missing
[1:45:28] heaven
[1:45:30] amen
[1:45:33] tell me one friend
[1:45:41] I like living a life of no regret
[1:45:46] now you might regret eating a donut but
[1:45:49] I don't regret serving God
[1:45:53] I do not regret serving God
[1:45:56] because no matter how bad the doctors
[1:45:59] report is
[1:46:02] God's got this
[1:46:05] [Applause]
[1:46:27] rekindling is like putting fresh wood on
[1:46:30] a fire
[1:46:31] brother Branham warned us to never warm
[1:46:34] ourselves by painted fire
[1:46:37] we're preparing for rapture
[1:46:40] listen there's zero unconverted people
[1:46:42] going
[1:46:46] turn to your neighbor say zero
[1:46:48] unconverted people going
[1:46:54] outside the ark they drown
[1:46:58] but God preached to him 120 years who
[1:47:00] are you going to blame
[1:47:04] staying in Egypt was not
[1:47:07] the answer
[1:47:10] this message is more than just to be
[1:47:12] associated with it
[1:47:16] this is more than a spectator sport
[1:47:21] [Music]
[1:47:24] God has no grandchildren
[1:47:27] so we don't want rotten eggs
[1:47:28] [Music]
[1:47:32] maybe what you've got is not holding you
[1:47:36] and you just need a fresh drink for the
[1:47:37] king
[1:47:41] listen I want him to do more than walk
[1:47:43] with me and talk with me
[1:47:45] [Music]
[1:47:48] he's worth living for
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:47:54] God takes me by the way of the grave
[1:47:58] I don't want to be a coward
[1:48:00] when I come to that spot that's what
[1:48:02] brother Brown said
[1:48:05] but my aspiration of life is
[1:48:09] is I stand here
[1:48:11] and as I preached my last sermon we'll
[1:48:13] begin to see the dead race
[1:48:17] and people come Among Us
[1:48:19] and our bodies begin to be changed
[1:48:23] so there's some unpacking that maybe you
[1:48:25] have to do
[1:48:27] unpack jealousy
[1:48:30] unpack Envy
[1:48:35] unpack bitterness toward one another
[1:48:40] we're going to set at the marriage
[1:48:42] supper of the Lamb
[1:48:44] foreign
[1:48:46] more than I know
[1:48:49] it's not going to be really any credit
[1:48:51] to you but no Jesus
[1:48:56] you say well brother Ron New Beginnings
[1:49:01] well brother Rhonda
[1:49:03] is that in the scripture or is that in a
[1:49:04] quote sure
[1:49:08] it's on your calendar
[1:49:10] new days
[1:49:12] new months New Seasons
[1:49:15] it's in your history books new chapters
[1:49:18] in your life
[1:49:20] God's calling you to a higher octave to
[1:49:24] serve him in a greater way
[1:49:26] God wants to make more than a church
[1:49:28] member out of you
[1:49:30] he wants to be the king of your heart
[1:49:33] [Music]
[1:49:36] he wants to cut wood with the wood
[1:49:38] Chopper
[1:49:42] [Music]
[1:49:44] and that Chopper might be you
[1:49:47] foreign
[1:49:50] Marcus I don't know what your plans are
[1:49:52] today
[1:49:55] but I thought of you as God dealt with
[1:49:57] me
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:04] about 20 years ago we sat on an airplane
[1:50:09] [Music]
[1:50:11] and we had the opportunity to talk
[1:50:16] and you told me in what a tough spot
[1:50:18] that you was in
[1:50:20] sharing that information with me you
[1:50:23] didn't tell me your life story but you
[1:50:25] told me enough
[1:50:26] that let me know that you had been in
[1:50:28] the message
[1:50:31] told me about the woman in Memphis
[1:50:35] and the woman speaking the storm out of
[1:50:37] existence
[1:50:39] [Music]
[1:50:42] I would go to meetings
[1:50:45] and tell that I met a man on an airplane
[1:50:47] and I've been praying for it
[1:50:52] a couple of months ago it came to me as
[1:50:54] you were sitting at the table beside of
[1:50:56] me beside of Timothy
[1:50:59] that she was the man that man that I
[1:51:02] personally had been looking for
[1:51:08] but you see you you may have been absent
[1:51:11] from my eyesight help me preach
[1:51:16] but you were never absent from God's
[1:51:19] eyesight
[1:51:21] let me just say this to you you might be
[1:51:23] wondering in life
[1:51:25] [Music]
[1:51:28] you may be a prodigal this morning but
[1:51:31] God never forgets you he's watching over
[1:51:35] your life
[1:51:36] knows where you're at
[1:51:39] but there'd be one today that said I
[1:51:41] need a new beginning in my life I'd like
[1:51:44] to just raise my hand before God
