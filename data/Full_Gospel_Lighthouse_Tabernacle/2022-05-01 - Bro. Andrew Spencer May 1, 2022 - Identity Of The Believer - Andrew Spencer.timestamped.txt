[31:59] i'm just so thankful to be a part of
[32:01] this great wonderful message and
[32:04] we just love the lord of all of our
[32:06] hearts
[32:07] amen amen amen if you have your bibles
[32:10] this morning i'd like to look over in
[32:11] the book of john chapter one the first
[32:14] chapter there verse 45
[32:17] and then colossians chapter 2
[32:20] colossians chapter 2 and verse 6.
[32:42] john chapter 1 verse 45.
[32:46] before we read i'd like to take this
[32:48] take this quote as
[32:51] as a theme this morning on the identity
[32:53] of the believer brother branham said in
[32:55] convinced and concerned he said
[32:57] he said a man's got to be convinced
[32:59] first convinced first and
[33:01] and the only convincing thing is the
[33:03] manifestation
[33:04] or the identity of the gospel being
[33:06] identified in you
[33:09] and when you see that you have passed
[33:10] from death into life and become a new
[33:13] creature in christ jesus
[33:15] that's the identity of the holy spirit
[33:18] that's exactly right how can the holy
[33:20] spirit write the bible and turn around
[33:23] and deny what he wrote
[33:25] see he cannot do it that's the identity
[33:28] of unbelief
[33:29] that's the identity of unbelief but the
[33:31] identity of belief jesus said that these
[33:34] signs
[33:35] shall identify those who believe in me
[33:38] now we know
[33:40] that's god's own word
[33:42] john chapter 1 and verse 45 and philip
[33:45] findeth nathanael and saith unto him
[33:48] we have found him
[33:49] of whom moses in the law and the
[33:51] prophets did right jesus of nazareth
[33:54] the son of joseph
[33:56] colossians chapter 2 and verse 6.
[34:07] colossians chapter 2 and verse 6 as ye
[34:10] have therefore received christ jesus the
[34:12] lord so walking in him
[34:15] rooted and built up in him and
[34:18] established in the faith
[34:20] as ye have been taught abounding therein
[34:22] with thanksgiving
[34:24] beware lest any man spoil
[34:27] you through philosophy and vain deceit
[34:29] after the tradition of men after the
[34:32] rudiments of the world and not after
[34:34] christ
[34:35] for in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[34:38] the godhead bodily and you are complete
[34:40] in him which is the head of all
[34:42] principality and power in whom also you
[34:46] are circumcised with the circumcision
[34:48] made
[34:49] without hands in putting off the body of
[34:52] the sins of the flesh by the
[34:54] circumcision of christ
[34:56] buried with him in baptism wherein also
[35:00] you are risen with him through the faith
[35:03] of the operation of god who hath raised
[35:05] him
[35:06] from the dead
[35:08] and you being dead in your sins and the
[35:10] uncircumcision of your flesh
[35:13] hath he quickened together with him what
[35:16] a powerful thing this morning that we
[35:18] know that the body without the life in
[35:20] it there's no there's no without the
[35:22] spirit there's no quickening power there
[35:24] and just like the word that we're
[35:26] reading
[35:27] it takes the spirit of the living god to
[35:29] come and quicken it and make it alive
[35:32] hath he quickened together with him
[35:34] having forgiven you all trespasses can
[35:36] you thank the lord for that this morning
[35:39] blotting out the handwriting of
[35:41] ordinance that was against us which was
[35:44] contrary to us and took it out of the
[35:47] way nailing it to his cross
[35:49] and having spoiled principalities and
[35:51] powers he made a show of them openly
[35:54] triumphing over them in it may god bless
[35:58] his word you may be seated in the
[36:00] presence of the lord as we said we'd
[36:01] like to speak to you
[36:03] on the identity of the believer and we
[36:06] we know that it's in humanity to search
[36:09] out their roots of where they came from
[36:11] and to to trace back their identity and
[36:13] look back at their natural genealogy and
[36:15] see where they came from and and there
[36:17] are some that are that have spent much
[36:20] time in their family history and and
[36:22] searching out for different links of how
[36:24] men are connected back and forth and
[36:26] there's there's even technology today
[36:29] that you can take a little sample of
[36:31] your of your dna and send it off and and
[36:34] you can spit in a little bottle and
[36:36] they'll send it off to a place and
[36:37] they'll send it back and they'll tell
[36:38] you where you came from but we recognize
[36:42] where we came from we don't have to spit
[36:44] in a bottle we don't have to send off
[36:45] our dna but we know exactly where we
[36:48] came from we came from the mind of god
[36:51] and we know that there's nothing that
[36:53] can hinder us from fulfilling exactly
[36:55] what god has destined us to be but men
[36:58] have spent much time in studying out
[37:00] their own genealogy and looking at
[37:02] looking at where they came from and
[37:04] technology has allowed them to look and
[37:06] see what region that they came from and
[37:08] there's so much percentage of so much
[37:10] percentage of norway and so much english
[37:13] and it's brought about and it builds up
[37:15] the human being and i've i've had a
[37:17] great fun with my wife and showing up
[37:19] that she she's militant in her ways and
[37:21] she's got two percent german in her and
[37:23] i i just not nothing against anything
[37:25] german but i sure enjoy i sure enjoy
[37:28] knowing that the militant things there
[37:30] are some things right there that that
[37:31] just but we
[37:33] there's some things right there that
[37:34] we're aware of and so so we know that
[37:37] there are certain percentages of where
[37:39] you came from and where you're going
[37:41] actually that shows up in your natural
[37:43] genealogy but how much greater in our in
[37:46] our spiritual dna that we came from the
[37:48] mind of god that that this is this is
[37:51] his mindset this is this is his doing
[37:53] this is what he brought us here we're
[37:55] not we're not here on our own we're not
[37:57] here and making up this this plan we
[38:00] have a purpose to fulfill the prophecy
[38:02] that was set out before us and and god
[38:05] is determined to make sure that you
[38:07] fulfill the prophecy that is according
[38:09] to to your purpose and to your plan and
[38:11] what you're going to do and what you're
[38:13] going to go through
[38:14] to think about today that god has so
[38:16] lined up everything in your life there's
[38:18] nothing coming and there's nothing going
[38:21] that can happen to you that god doesn't
[38:23] already know about you see you are a
[38:25] spiritual gene of almighty god
[38:28] brother barum said he said he said
[38:30] before i could act as a human before i
[38:32] could walk like a human before i could
[38:34] talk like a human i have to be born a
[38:36] human he said how would a knot on a tree
[38:39] know how i acted how could he ever say i
[38:41] don't act like that the only way that he
[38:44] could be that or would be to be born
[38:46] like me that's the way the organization
[38:49] is dead and draw people away because it
[38:51] went after a creed but in order to be a
[38:54] son of god you've got to be born of the
[38:56] spirit of god and then you become
[38:58] christ-like and do the works of christ
[39:00] then you're not funny to them people you
[39:02] see a human acting like a human is not
[39:04] funny a christian acting like a
[39:07] christian is born of the same spirit and
[39:09] you see you watch people they they make
[39:11] fun of the holy ghost or they make fun
[39:13] of the way that you act they've not been
[39:15] born the way that you've been born but
[39:17] if you understand why they're acting
[39:19] like they're acting a human being acting
[39:21] like a human ain't nothing an ordinary
[39:23] but when men get mixed up in their
[39:25] identities and they start when women
[39:27] started acting like man and man starting
[39:29] acting like women there's something
[39:31] that's messed up but when christians
[39:33] start acting like christians and sons
[39:35] and daughters of god start acting like
[39:37] sons and daughters of god it's not
[39:39] unnatural but it's natural to the mind
[39:41] of god you see god is all supernatural
[39:44] and the god the supernatural is just
[39:46] simply natural it's natural to him to be
[39:49] supernatural and when we see the mind of
[39:52] god coming down when we see the
[39:54] supernatural being manifested right in
[39:56] front of us brother random said that's
[39:58] the mind of christ when you see jesus
[40:01] showing up and when you see jesus sowing
[40:04] out it is the mind of christ that is
[40:07] being dispersed through the church of
[40:08] the living god
[40:11] we know that that we as mortal beings we
[40:14] we went from time beings to eternal
[40:16] beings it is the gene of god that is in
[40:19] us that has made us sons and daughters
[40:21] of god we did not become seed we were
[40:24] seed and because we were seed therefore
[40:28] we could be reborn and there's no one
[40:30] that can match your identity when you
[40:32] say that you have a personal identity
[40:35] there's nobody that can take your spot
[40:37] you can look at all of the samples of
[40:39] your dna you can have a twin but it will
[40:42] not match up according to what you are
[40:44] and what god is destined you to be is
[40:47] exactly what you will be there is no
[40:49] similarity like the bride of jesus
[40:52] christ there is no affinity like the
[40:54] bride of jesus christ it is the holy
[40:57] ghost that is our identification
[41:01] what god has for you is for you it ain't
[41:04] for somebody else god ain't some mailman
[41:07] that drops a mail off at somebody else's
[41:09] house if he's got healing for you he'll
[41:12] drop it off at your house if he's got
[41:14] deliverance for you he'll drop it off at
[41:16] your house if he's got prodigals that
[41:18] are returning
[41:20] because god
[41:22] won't drop your mail off at somebody
[41:24] else's house he knows who you are he
[41:27] knows what you need he knows what you've
[41:30] been destined for what god has for me is
[41:33] for me and hell and how water might come
[41:36] but it won't stop the mail of god
[41:39] getting to me where i'm supposed to be
[41:41] at
[41:43] what god has for me is for me
[41:46] my breakthrough my holy ghost
[41:50] my deliverance
[41:53] hallelujah
[42:01] glory
[42:05] you see man's
[42:07] what man's nature or his style of
[42:09] preaching
[42:10] or his gift
[42:12] god has placed that on the inside of him
[42:14] to meet the challenge of the day
[42:17] and just like with you as you become as
[42:20] you recognize and you are woke up to the
[42:23] fact that you are a son of god god has
[42:26] put something on the inside of you to
[42:28] meet the challenge of the day to
[42:30] vindicate that the true and living god
[42:32] of this hour that the message coming
[42:35] forth in this time is to produce exactly
[42:38] what it is this is what you are watching
[42:41] is modern events made clear by prophecy
[42:44] and what you are witnessing in the pride
[42:46] of jesus christ is the bride's revival
[42:49] it took those seven unknown thunders
[42:51] back there to wake her up and this is
[42:54] her revival and she is identified not
[42:57] with some denomination she's not
[42:59] identified with some man-made creed but
[43:02] she's identified with a message
[43:04] and your life has matched the message
[43:06] it's matched the promise of an archangel
[43:09] that this is christ himself that is
[43:12] descended down first thessalonians four
[43:15] and six it tells us that christ shouted
[43:18] sin with a voice and a shout and the
[43:20] trump of an angel and brother burnham
[43:23] said in the message of rapture he said
[43:25] that a god that christ does all three as
[43:28] he's descending
[43:33] what you are watching is heaven
[43:35] descending to you what you watched up
[43:37] there in slovenia canyon that was not
[43:40] jesus it was christ it was the anointing
[43:43] that came down the shout is the message
[43:46] the voice is the one that wakes up the
[43:48] sleeping bride but it's the trumpet that
[43:50] gathers away the trumpet is the day it's
[43:53] the catching away
[43:55] it's the rapture that brings an
[43:57] ascending it's the trumpet
[44:01] it's your day
[44:03] what christ did he descended so that you
[44:05] can ascend
[44:07] but when we go in a rapture it's a
[44:09] signal to israel that she will receive
[44:12] her two prophets that are under the same
[44:14] angelic covenant that this message was
[44:17] under
[44:19] god didn't bring you this message just
[44:21] to leave you where you are he's wanting
[44:24] you to ascend higher come up here little
[44:26] bride
[44:31] this message is a pushing higher it's an
[44:34] ascension message he's not wanting to
[44:36] leave you where you are he's not wanting
[44:38] you to stay in your footprint he's not
[44:40] wanting
[44:44] oh come on somebody
[44:46] they say that when when neil armstrong
[44:48] went up there that his footprint is
[44:50] still on the moon
[44:52] i'll say this hell can do everything it
[44:54] wants to me it can put me in the grave
[44:57] but my footprint will still be here
[45:00] he can try to get rid of me he can try
[45:02] to mock me he can try to make fun of me
[45:05] but my footprint is seen on the face of
[45:11] it's seen on the face of satan and he
[45:14] knows where i'm standing at he knows
[45:16] that i know how i know
[45:20] he knows that you know that you are a
[45:24] son and daughter of god and he's tried
[45:26] everything
[45:29] to keep you from your identity you're
[45:31] not in an identity crisis you know who
[45:34] you are you don't have spiritual amnesia
[45:40] i've seen that water tower i know that
[45:43] it's still there
[45:45] god still got sons that are looking for
[45:47] it
[45:47] [Applause]
[45:55] it's an essential message and there
[45:57] ain't been no other age
[45:59] that's been promised like it's been
[46:01] promised in this age of malachi 4 of
[46:04] luke 17 30 of john 14 and 12. this ain't
[46:08] luther's message
[46:09] this ain't wesley's message this is your
[46:12] message this ain't just william
[46:15] branham's message this is my message
[46:19] it's known you can't separate
[46:21] the message from the messenger but you
[46:23] can't separate it from me either i am
[46:26] the message i am the bride's revival the
[46:29] mighty angel is in me i am she
[46:32] she knows what he once done with the
[46:34] word i have found my identity in the
[46:37] baptism of the holy ghost
[46:43] you can search your dna in the ohio
[46:46] you'll have all kinds of traces
[46:48] better tell you where you came from
[46:50] i have i have come my way
[46:53] and i have seen some samples of where i
[46:54] came from that there is a future there
[46:57] is a future home for me
[46:59] that what i am seeing is these are the
[47:02] things that are to be
[47:03] this is our rapture this is our
[47:06] leadership this is our communion
[47:09] this is the invisible union of the bride
[47:12] i have found myself in this message
[47:17] i found myself in this message
[47:19] i'm not looking i i know that i know i
[47:21] got a whole family that's sitting here
[47:23] i've got a whole family that's going to
[47:25] be there
[47:29] [Applause]
[47:31] i got a family that's going to be there
[47:34] and we are determined to make sure what
[47:36] god took a picture of you before the
[47:38] foundation of the world
[47:40] you might go through some stuff but you
[47:42] are going to find your way
[47:45] to write where god thought of you before
[47:47] the foundation of the world
[47:48] and it might seem like you're never
[47:50] going to get in a family album
[47:53] and satan might do all of he wants to he
[47:55] can do his best but he still don't have
[47:57] enough to stop you if he would have had
[47:59] enough he'd have brought enough but he
[48:01] ain't got enough to stop you
[48:03] when god took that picture of you
[48:05] brother jordan it was not in your best
[48:07] right here but it was in his mind
[48:14] i am
[48:15] the prophet's prophecy
[48:18] this message has brought us into a
[48:20] fellowship with him
[48:21] it's a fellowship with him he didn't
[48:23] educate us unto him but we contacted him
[48:27] we've handled him to get his believing
[48:29] children
[48:30] to to a spot of recognition of who they
[48:33] are and what they've gone through that
[48:35] is why it's appearing to you so that you
[48:37] fulfill your purpose in the promise
[48:41] it's his threefold purpose that he would
[48:43] come and he would restore and that he
[48:45] would reveal himself as a son of man
[48:48] that he would come and he'd have the
[48:49] preeminence and the bride of jesus
[48:50] christ and that he would come in his
[48:53] threefold purpose and he'll change your
[48:55] body
[48:57] when god met abraham up there abraham
[49:00] knew that it was on he knew that the one
[49:03] that had led him all the days of his
[49:05] life this was the same one what did he
[49:07] do he watched and he identified that the
[49:10] one that was talking to him was the one
[49:12] that was standing in front of him and
[49:14] you watch the effect of the revelation
[49:17] that it had on abraham you watch what it
[49:19] did when he changed his name i'll no
[49:21] longer call you abram but i'll call you
[49:24] abraham i put a part of myself in you i
[49:27] put hello
[49:29] i put a little bit of myself on the
[49:31] inside of you so that you recognize that
[49:33] you cannot be broke away from the
[49:35] covenant this is who i am
[49:38] so you see no matter what how old
[49:40] abraham got he was connected to the
[49:43] author of life
[49:44] he deposited a part of himself in his
[49:47] name and you think well why in the world
[49:49] does that matter
[49:50] your name
[49:51] could not be called bride until you had
[49:54] a change
[49:56] but when you knew when god knew where
[49:58] you were he said i'll no longer call you
[50:00] church
[50:01] but i'll call you bride abraham so that
[50:04] you know that i'm talking to you the
[50:06] rest of the church world can't identify
[50:09] themselves with you
[50:12] but you have been identified by him
[50:15] dispersing his seed on the inside of you
[50:19] your seed is your identity
[50:22] oh god help me
[50:24] you're a part of his plan i'm a part of
[50:27] his purpose i'm a part of god's future
[50:31] that seed didn't come from my mom and my
[50:33] daddy
[50:36] that natural seed that passes through
[50:38] that passes through holy wedlock as it
[50:40] works its way to the womb it is
[50:42] bypassing
[50:44] 999 000 just to get to a spot a
[50:48] predestination and god knows what it
[50:50] will be he knows what color hair to have
[50:52] him knows what color eyes it's going to
[50:54] have
[50:56] and god knew what you would be before
[50:57] the foundation of the world and he is
[51:00] going to watch as what he dispersed into
[51:02] the ground of faith
[51:04] and watch as it becomes more than just a
[51:06] seed that went down more than just what
[51:08] he threw onto the ground but he's gonna
[51:10] watch it manifest
[51:14] here imagine as god throws out his seed
[51:17] and he throws out he throws out the seed
[51:19] of william branham and it manifests
[51:21] exactly what it was to be
[51:23] but god didn't just stop right there he
[51:26] had jim noel's that he had to bring up
[51:28] he had some michael buchanans that he
[51:30] had to bring up
[51:33] he had some steven shorts that had to be
[51:35] manifested and it looked like it looked
[51:37] like all chaos was going to stop you
[51:39] from getting here but remember he
[51:41] departed he deposited a part of himself
[51:43] brother brother brother then he he put
[51:46] it there
[51:47] and it's got to come forward you can go
[51:49] through struggles you can go through
[51:51] birth pains but that baby's got to come
[51:53] out
[51:55] you can go through world wars you can go
[51:57] through trials but it's got to come out
[52:02] your greatest character is shown in the
[52:04] midst of a trial
[52:06] and when abraham was in the midst of his
[52:08] greatest trial of his life
[52:10] the bible said he was not weak in faith
[52:13] but he was strong in god
[52:15] oh yeah you can look over on the
[52:16] backside of the old testament and you
[52:18] can see you can see what he did you can
[52:21] see what's over there on the other side
[52:23] of the of the old testament
[52:31] but it doesn't pass through
[52:35] these few pages is what separates the
[52:38] old testament from the new testament
[52:40] over on this side
[52:43] over on this side of the old testament
[52:46] abraham abraham abraham got himself in
[52:49] trouble abraham tried to have the
[52:50] promise to everybody else abraham tried
[52:53] to put the new birth
[52:55] he tried to say it was just for his mom
[52:57] or daddy i'm preaching to you now
[53:00] abraham said i'm too old for this
[53:02] abraham said my wife ain't got enough
[53:03] strength to birth out a son but on this
[53:06] side
[53:08] on the side of the new testament
[53:10] it shows that abraham was not weak in
[53:13] faith it shows that abraham was strong
[53:17] on one side of the blood
[53:20] if you look on the old side yeah i see
[53:22] dirty rotten scandals yes i see all
[53:24] kinds of torah more yes i see you what's
[53:26] no good but on this side of the blood
[53:30] on this side of the covenant
[53:32] it's your identity he doesn't trace it
[53:35] back he can never be found no more
[53:41] i'm not identified with a man that once
[53:44] was but i'm identified in a new identity
[53:47] [Applause]
[53:48] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[53:50] a new creature
[53:52] legion you have found your new identity
[53:55] you're no longer in a tomb you're no
[53:57] longer in shackles
[54:01] i am what he thought of me before the
[54:03] foundation of the world sister connie he
[54:06] can try to rob you he can try to stop
[54:08] you but you are predestinated to prove
[54:12] that satan was a liar
[54:17] he can't stop you he can't get to you
[54:20] because there's a promise over you
[54:25] god's going to get us home god knows
[54:27] where you're at
[54:29] [Applause]
[54:31] you watch the effect of the revelation
[54:33] that it had on abraham when he went out
[54:35] there the one that had talked to him all
[54:36] of his life and when elohim come walking
[54:40] down the road
[54:42] what did he say
[54:45] there was three walking
[54:48] there was three walking
[54:49] come here gabriel
[54:51] come here michael
[54:52] i need to use you for a minute
[54:54] i need to use you for a minute and he
[54:56] blew himself a body
[54:58] and he stepped into that body
[55:01] who is this
[55:02] who is this that walked up to your tent
[55:05] who is this that came to your situation
[55:07] who is this melchizedek
[55:09] who is this jesus christ how can he do
[55:12] these things it's the same one that
[55:14] spoke let there be light and you're
[55:16] watching the same manifestation that
[55:18] took place back there in the beginning
[55:20] let there be light let there be seed and
[55:23] it's the same one that's bringing the
[55:25] seed in your life to manifestation
[55:31] it followed him all of his days and
[55:34] you've been a close listener
[55:37] you watched him
[55:38] you ain't understood everything that
[55:40] that's happened in your life you haven't
[55:42] understood why you had to journey like
[55:43] your journey but you watch the effect of
[55:45] the revelation that the one that's been
[55:47] talking to you
[55:49] is the one that's going to come walking
[55:51] down your dusty road
[55:56] let me say this
[55:58] he didn't create he didn't create
[56:00] himself a body and walk down to somebody
[56:03] else's address
[56:09] he knows where he's going sister
[56:11] stephanie
[56:12] [Music]
[56:13] he knows where he's going
[56:15] he didn't create a body so so that he
[56:17] could step in so that he could bring his
[56:19] message to a different destination that
[56:22] was predestinated
[56:24] he predestinated you so that he could
[56:27] walk upon you and talk to you have a
[56:30] conversation with you and when you have
[56:32] a conversation with melchizedek it's
[56:34] given you authority for a body change
[56:37] you may not understand everything that
[56:39] he's doing when he's walking by your way
[56:41] but your identity is bound in this one
[56:44] to loose you
[56:46] to loose you to what you are to be
[56:49] he didn't leave in the same way that he
[56:51] found him he changed him
[56:54] i'll say this when he found me he didn't
[56:56] leave me the same way you left me when
[56:58] he found me right there
[57:01] i started talking a different language i
[57:04] started moving to a different rhythm of
[57:05] the music i started dancing according to
[57:08] the word
[57:09] [Applause]
[57:12] because i found my freedom in him this
[57:14] one that's been walking by your way the
[57:16] one that you've been fellowshipping with
[57:18] you've heard his voice you've seen
[57:20] visions he's led you to this moment for
[57:23] a moment such as this esther he didn't
[57:26] lead you to this kingdom so that you
[57:28] could stay here
[57:31] he didn't just give you this palace so
[57:33] that you could have a nice bed he didn't
[57:35] give you this palace so that you could
[57:37] come in and say
[57:39] i was the one that he chose he sent you
[57:41] here for a purpose
[57:46] when abraham
[57:48] catches a revelation
[57:51] it's the one i've been talking to it's
[57:54] the one i've been fellowshipping with
[57:56] you watch
[57:57] there's three
[58:00] but he says my lord
[58:04] will you watch what happens over in
[58:06] sodom and gomorrah
[58:09] they didn't have the same revelation
[58:11] that abraham had
[58:13] and you think
[58:14] why didn't they catch it
[58:18] because the angel stood up there at the
[58:20] tent with you
[58:21] some of you met that angel at a tent
[58:23] last night
[58:26] some of you met him this morning
[58:29] some of you are gonna walk out of the
[58:30] service completely different than you
[58:32] walked in here
[58:34] because when elohim gets to walking
[58:37] there's going to be some cells that
[58:39] start changing
[58:40] gray hairs are going to start turning
[58:42] back to black hair
[58:45] things that were falling out are now
[58:46] being put back in
[58:51] oh won't it be your time
[58:55] [Applause]
[58:58] you can try all you want to to put the
[59:01] things that have fell off of you put
[59:02] them back in place but one moment
[59:06] you ain't lost one of them hairs you
[59:08] ain't lost one of your children what god
[59:10] put on the inside of you god will bring
[59:13] forth
[59:14] and satan ain't nothing but a pervert
[59:16] but you are a creator
[59:18] and satan's trying to stop your creation
[59:21] you know what you created you created
[59:24] worship you created a vessel for the
[59:26] holy ghost
[59:28] you created a worship you created a
[59:30] heart of praise you created children and
[59:33] satan is trying to stop your children
[59:35] he's trying to stop your worship he's
[59:37] trying to stop your praise he's trying
[59:40] to stop you with sickness but what god
[59:42] has meant for you to manifest you will
[59:45] manifest abraham
[59:47] get ready
[59:50] he's got a purpose
[1:00:00] let me say
[1:00:01] you know what you created
[1:00:05] don't you have yourself a little
[1:00:06] testimony service right there
[1:00:08] abraham
[1:00:10] you know what you created
[1:00:12] you know what's been told about you you
[1:00:14] know what's been said that you will
[1:00:16] manifest have yourself a testimony i
[1:00:18] created
[1:00:20] i created a reagan in an alley
[1:00:24] i created a dance
[1:00:26] i created a worship i created a praise i
[1:00:29] created an atmosphere and satan can try
[1:00:32] to stop what i created
[1:00:39] but where did i get that
[1:00:40] from where'd i get what satan can never
[1:00:44] do
[1:00:45] where'd i get that at
[1:00:51] yeah you can go ahead and let that sink
[1:00:53] in for a moment
[1:00:55] but when back there in the garden of
[1:00:57] eden
[1:00:58] there was an affinity
[1:01:00] that there could be an intermingling of
[1:01:02] seeds
[1:01:05] but god after the garden of eden he
[1:01:07] destroyed he destroyed that affinity
[1:01:10] that no longer that intermingling can
[1:01:12] take place
[1:01:14] he broke it and science has looked for
[1:01:16] it it has searched for it and it's tried
[1:01:19] to do its very best to say that that's
[1:01:21] where your identity came from it's tried
[1:01:23] to trace you back to this is what you
[1:01:26] were this is what and they have looked
[1:01:28] all over
[1:01:30] they have looked all over
[1:01:32] for what happened back there in that
[1:01:33] garden of eden
[1:01:35] satan knew
[1:01:37] that he couldn't create so he worked his
[1:01:39] way into the serpent
[1:01:41] because there was an affinity that was
[1:01:43] there it was a similarity that could be
[1:01:46] passed through
[1:01:47] so satan worked his way through the
[1:01:50] serpent
[1:01:53] because he didn't have the power to
[1:01:55] create
[1:01:57] [Applause]
[1:01:59] oh
[1:02:00] now start thinking about what you
[1:02:02] created
[1:02:04] start thinking about what you did start
[1:02:07] thinking about what you prophesied start
[1:02:09] thinking about what you said what you're
[1:02:11] coming here to manifest and satan can
[1:02:13] never do what you have done
[1:02:17] he can pervert he can take your body and
[1:02:20] make it sick he can take your mind and
[1:02:22] put all kinds of things in it and try to
[1:02:25] bombard your mind
[1:02:28] but you are a creator
[1:02:31] satan comes in and he puts all kinds of
[1:02:33] things in your mind and he tries to tell
[1:02:35] you that you're not good enough
[1:02:37] but you watch the spirit of creation
[1:02:38] start working and you say let there be
[1:02:40] light over this situation
[1:02:43] one word
[1:02:44] one moment is enough
[1:02:47] to stop satan in his tracks and if you
[1:02:49] create one sale of faith if you create
[1:02:52] one cell of worship if you create one
[1:02:56] sale of praise
[1:02:58] [Applause]
[1:03:00] it's more than satan can ever create
[1:03:10] oh man
[1:03:11] oh man
[1:03:13] brother baron said in christ a mystery
[1:03:15] of god revealed he said identified
[1:03:17] that's why the devil's howling it's
[1:03:19] because this is being identified no
[1:03:22] longer as jesus of 2000 years ago but
[1:03:24] it's the son of man once again in the
[1:03:26] form of his bride and what god has put
[1:03:29] on the inside of her she will manifest
[1:03:31] and you can try to throw everything on
[1:03:33] top of her don't you worry about what
[1:03:36] you've been through don't you worry
[1:03:37] about what you're going through you will
[1:03:39] be what god destined you to be you may
[1:03:42] not look like the picture just now
[1:03:44] but abraham
[1:03:46] get ready
[1:03:58] let me go let me just go a few more
[1:04:00] chapters here
[1:04:01] when abraham takes
[1:04:03] the one that
[1:04:06] the one that came out of his own loins
[1:04:10] when he took his own creation upon a
[1:04:11] hill
[1:04:15] when he took his own creation up on a
[1:04:17] hill
[1:04:21] sometimes you're gonna have to take what
[1:04:22] you created
[1:04:25] and put it on the sacrifice
[1:04:30] line out what you've just do what you've
[1:04:32] just said
[1:04:34] there's gonna come a time
[1:04:36] in your life
[1:04:38] when god's gonna ask for your creation
[1:04:42] i'll say this
[1:04:44] i'll gladly give
[1:04:49] i'll gladly give
[1:04:51] abraham
[1:04:52] this is what i'm asking you to do
[1:04:55] take your son
[1:04:58] your creation
[1:05:00] thine only son
[1:05:01] he didn't call ismael
[1:05:06] because ismail was created
[1:05:10] before the promise
[1:05:12] ismail was created by his own flesh
[1:05:15] but what isaac what came out of abraham
[1:05:18] had to do with a hand of melchizedek
[1:05:21] coming to his tent
[1:05:24] abraham take your son your only son
[1:05:28] isaac up there on that mountain and
[1:05:30] worship and sacrifice
[1:05:33] and isaac
[1:05:37] isaac knew what to do
[1:05:40] he'd been in a spot of worship before
[1:05:43] father
[1:05:45] we've got the fire
[1:05:48] father we've got the word
[1:05:50] but where's your sacrifice but you watch
[1:05:53] the spirit of prophecy come on abraham
[1:05:57] said my son
[1:05:58] god shall provide for himself a
[1:06:01] sacrifice and because abraham did
[1:06:08] what only abraham could do
[1:06:11] brother graham said
[1:06:13] god spoke to him and said abraham
[1:06:16] because what you did
[1:06:19] what only you could do
[1:06:23] not what somebody else did
[1:06:25] there's going to be there's going to be
[1:06:26] some people that are rise up and try to
[1:06:28] take your glory but you're the one that
[1:06:30] created this
[1:06:33] there's gonna be some people rise up and
[1:06:35] say i was there i'm the one no because
[1:06:38] you did this because you chose the hard
[1:06:40] way because you chose to live this
[1:06:42] message so that you wouldn't just
[1:06:44] identify with just some church building
[1:06:47] or another movement but because you did
[1:06:49] what god destined you to do
[1:06:52] [Applause]
[1:06:53] because you did this that in blessing i
[1:06:55] will bless thee and in multiplying i
[1:06:57] will multiply and thy seed shall possess
[1:07:00] the gate of his enemies
[1:07:02] [Applause]
[1:07:03] brother branham said if that don't make
[1:07:05] you holler he said you're dead thy seed
[1:07:08] shall possess the gate of his enemy name
[1:07:10] your gate
[1:07:12] put it in front of you possess it
[1:07:14] overtake it this is the inheritance of
[1:07:17] the saints of the living god
[1:07:20] what god has for you is for you and you
[1:07:23] will overtake it and you will possess it
[1:07:28] why don't you just go ahead and start
[1:07:29] speaking to the atmosphere this is what
[1:07:31] i need this is what i want
[1:07:34] i ain't talking some prosperity gospel
[1:07:36] i'm talking the sovereignty of the holy
[1:07:38] ghost
[1:07:43] [Applause]
[1:07:48] because you did this
[1:07:51] because you had faith
[1:07:52] when nobody else had faith
[1:07:54] abraham didn't know how it was going to
[1:07:56] come out
[1:08:05] you may not be able to look
[1:08:07] and have the foresight of almighty god
[1:08:10] but god's got long-range vision over
[1:08:13] your life and what god has seen over you
[1:08:16] it will come to pass
[1:08:18] thy seed will possess the gate of its
[1:08:21] enemies you watch what will take place
[1:08:23] when you start believing
[1:08:27] he ain't asking for somebody else's
[1:08:28] faith he's asking for your faith he
[1:08:31] ain't even asking you to believe in your
[1:08:33] faith he's asking you to believe in him
[1:08:39] oh man i'm gonna i'm gonna go ahead and
[1:08:42] take my i'm gonna take my crossbow and
[1:08:44] i'm gonna go ahead and shoot right
[1:08:45] through that thing god don't want your
[1:08:47] faith god ain't wanting he's wanting
[1:08:49] your faith let me bring this back so you
[1:08:51] don't think i'm confusing you he's
[1:08:53] wanting your faith but he's not wanting
[1:08:55] you to have faith in your own faith
[1:08:58] he's not wanting you to have faith in
[1:09:00] what you think you can do he's wanting
[1:09:02] you to have faith in the god of
[1:09:04] impossibilities
[1:09:08] abraham you can't do this on your own
[1:09:11] abraham you can't create this son
[1:09:13] abraham you can't take him upon that
[1:09:14] mountain by yourself abraham you can't
[1:09:16] bring him down by yourself but when i go

[1:10:06] out satan you can bring all your demons

[1:17:16] and come back down with another son
[1:17:19] he'd come back down off of that mountain

[1:17:33] this war path to what you're going
[1:17:35] through
[1:17:38] if your name was victory before you got
[1:17:40] to the mountain your name will be
[1:17:43] victory when you come off the mountain
