I'm not going to have anything to preach tomorrow but I thought it was wonderful and so we just are so appreciative of that amen amen God bless you God bless you if you will turn with me in your scriptures to Psalms chapter 51. and verse 1. Psalms 51 and verse 1. today I'd like to speak on sweeping it under the Ruck we need a blood we need a blood that'll cleanse Our Lives amen amen Psalms chapter 51 and verse 1. this is incredible words have mercy upon me o God according to thy loving kindness according to the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin as ever before me against thee and thee only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified in when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest behold I was shaping an iniquity and sin did my mother conceived me behold thou desires the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to no wisdom Purge me with hyssip and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear the joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken May Rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities creating me a clean heart o God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not by Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of my salvation and uphold me with a free spirit amen isn't that what you want today now invite him by your Pew let's pray Lord Jesus we stand as a needy people today we have needs Lord the speaker has needs no doubt all through this audience there's many needs father you're a God that can supply them all you've never seen a disease that defeated you never seen a sin that you couldn't take care of Lord I just asked you today that you would just come and wash us you have a blood that can purges clean as snow Lord we invite your holy presence among us today and I pray that you would strengthen us in a mighty way we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen and amen you can be seated in Luke chapter 22 and verse 31 Jesus is having a very powerful conversation with Simon we would know him as Peter Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he might sift you as wheat Simon wasn't the only one that Satan has a desire to sift I love these next words but I have prayed for thee but I have prayed for thee that thy faith failed not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren our age that we live in we recognize that it's a wicked age the characteristics of this age would be borne out in Revelations chapter 3. and as John would write it I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am enriched and increased with goods and and have need of nothing and know us not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counseled thee tobiah make gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed in the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with thy saith that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and be zealous therefore and repent I love these words Behold I stand at the door and knock all the other Church ages Jesus was working among them but in our church age Jesus is on the outside of the door trying to get in behold I stand at the door and knocking If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me since the fall of man's sin has reigned and it not only reigned in humanity but it reigned in the earth to where the Earth became cursed animals know the fall animals are under the persecution a young doe the other day was dropped to a young baby right at the end of my driveway and I've walked past her a few times over the last last few days and that baby's laying there and it's completely head and once in a while it'll stand up and it's it's got those white spots don't get that Bambi idea right quick now yeah but anyway immediately when that baby is born it's born with no sin on its body there's a reason for that because predators are already looking for that baby seems like almost unfair that anything that beautiful and being born like that is immediately got a predator after it it just whether it's a bear we've got about a 400 pound Bearer running through our property and he's beautiful one of the biggest mayors that we've had for quite a long time there they get in my trash they they get in my dumpster they get on my car last night had your dogs barking and I went out and you know they're just they're just there but that Barrel if he could get to that little deer he would eat it he would he would destroy it and they eat so many a year but it wasn't like that in the Garden of Eden everything ate grass everything ate fruits and everything was eating from the natural but immediately when man fell when man fell when the amateur God fell off sin began to reign amen now it don't mean that Satan owns it but he tries to possess it you see Satan he really can't get to your soul when you're born again and you're filled with the spirit of God but he will attack your spirit then he'll attack your flesh he would like to destroy you if he could but thank God for the angels of God the word of that is our protector God that is watching over us kind of reminds me of a little boy I think this is interesting I heard this from Brother Dan daisley and a little boy was playing in a mud puddle you know he so enjoyed playing in that mud apuddle but after a while he was drenched he was muddy he was a horrible condition he would come in and his mom would clean him all up and and she would send him out and said don't get in that again and for long about an hour later here he come again just as muddy just as dirty just as wet this time she gave him and she cleaned him up and she washed him and this time she gave him a sermon she said now Johnny you cannot get in that mud puddle again and she began to give him warnings you know you as parents sometimes almost you'll know Hunter you'll know you'll give him a sermon just before you walk into a restaurant or before you go into church you'll give them bribes you'll give them all different kind of things you'll promise to take their life if because you heard it from your mom and dad and so you know he left and he went out and she was watching that was a better good amen and she watched him through the kitchen window and she watched him as he went out through the yard and he was getting near that mud puddle and you know he made circles for a while took his shoes off and you know after a little while they put his toe in it you know he's kicking in the air and before long all of a sudden you know he was in here he came and you know what this time when he came he she began to repeat the sermon why did you do it why did you do it and here's here's a I I'm not just telling this story for no reason at all he said the devil made me do it she said Johnny you we are told as Christians to get behind me Satan he said I did and he pushed me in they wonder how much that we really put on the devil when he really wasn't it around it was just our human nature that did it something sometimes we're kind of judgmental of one another I know you're not but but it's kind of like a difference between the hog and a sheep now you know as ministers we're trying to get sheep so in our profession here we have a desire that you know everybody can be saved because it's a scripture God don't send nobody to hell your choices do that for you but it's like obesity the Hulk it came time for the fair you know the owner went and it cleaned it up and he washed it and you know and you know as he washes the hog and he washes that pig all that he can wash it he cleans it it takes a lot of Dawn dishwashing detergent to get every little thing out of the crevice and you know but you know then he puts a ribbon on it and he tries its best to put it in an environment to where it you know between now and the judging between now and the judging uh you know we've got to have her clean and you know Bessie she's you know she's really nice she eats the corn she eats the you know the whatever that they give him and you know she's really nice she enjoys the clean environment but it didn't change her nature you can keep her up for a week you can keep her up for two weeks and you can wash it and wash it and calm it and comb it and brush it and hug it and you know whenever Bessie's all clean you can put perfume on her and she'll smell good you might even tend because she's been so nice you might even tend to kiss her on the cheek a little bit but she's still a hog sometimes you forget she's still a hawk but you take her home and you open the trailer and she goes back into her normal environment you know what she does she don't stay in the cleanest place she goes right back to what's home for and she's all joyful and she's having a Revival right back in that Hulk no matter how much work that you've done and you're thinking all that work that I did to clean her up and keep her clean now I have to be really honest with you I spent a lot of time in my life cleaning Hawks you see I as a man human being I don't have the option to know whose Hogs and who's not so you know Here to Eternity I'm going to still clean some Hawks and I'm gonna wash him and I'm gonna clean him and I'm gonna put perfume on him I'm gonna give him ribbons but they're gonna go right back to that Hog Pen you know it's a fact but you know what the good thing about it is you don't know the difference either when we all start out some of us smell like Hawks some of us acted like Hawks but down on the inside of us we were sheep but we always worship we just need it to be cleaned up a little bit [Applause] we were born in sin and we were shaping an iniquity you were capable of a lot of bad things but God rich in Mercy oh brother Ron not me well I got a scripture for you all have sinned say it with me all have sinned and come short of the glory of God I want that to settle in just for a moment before we go too far here all have sinned so it gives none of us as a right to point fingers now now let me just say we have an accuser and that accuser he keeps a good list now see the devil doesn't know when you when you repent when you repent God wipes your slate clean when it comes down and gives you the new birth God takes your book that's got a lot of stuff in it now it don't only have your sins it's got your father's sins and your mother's sins good of people as they was they were carrying their mother's sins and their father's sins and it was passed down to you nobody taught you to steal the cookie nobody taught you when you were a little child when you got in a jam to tell a little white one not me not me listen not me lived at my house not me lived at my house and there were three not me's raised in Preachers home raised in a preacher's home not me lived at our house I bet not me lives in a lot of your houses now now I bring this to to a point when God came looking for Adam God knew where Adam was at but God as he begins to walk through the the Garden of Eden he's calling for Adam allowing Adam the opportunity to come clean he is hiding from God before sin he never hid from God he never hid from God he didn't even know he was naked but after sin came immediately he began to get religious and put on a cloak of covering to cover his sin and so God has a conversation with him and in that conversation he begins to to find out who caused the fall because God's given him some orders to where that do this but don't do this listen there would have never been a fall if Adam and Eve would have only listened to God but listen God prepared a blood before the foundation of the world he knew in the nature of humanity that we would fall listen man is always creating an eye a a trash Heap that's how archaeologists find out how people operated if they can only find the dump to where man lived at they can figure out what kind of dishes what kind of Cups what kind of things that they did what kind of work that they did are you with me now [Music] I want you to understand there's a lot that can be known of your trash but man's nature is to heighten God a god that is all-knowing a god that is infinite he knows it anyway but but the serpent has always caused man to become religious and try to cover his sin up they scream for God to give them a law now listen God's the holy God so when God gave man a law to live by he gave them a law to which that was to his standards Humanity cannot live clean enough to God in Israel today yesterday would have been their Sabbath day it's an inconvenient they still live under the law there's no public transit people don't go 100 yards from their house or 100 feet from their house they can't collect wood they can't collect a lot of things elevators don't work because they live under the law escalators don't work it's a very inconvenient deal because they never recognize that Jesus came as the lord of the Harvest and the lord of the Sabbath Listen by grace are we saved well brother Ron I can live by the law well let me just give you a test we are Americans amen you're it'll probably work for you if you came from Europe but we're Americans being Americans we've married in and out in and out in and out and so under the law if you had an illegitimate child boy you're quiet now if you had an illegitimate child it cursed your family for 400 years I was thinking about this note as I was even coming to church today I I know most of you and most of you live under a curse not you but your forefathers brought forth without marriage children don't get holier than me my family's guilty too and I don't have to go far your family is guilty too so that means that 400 years of your Generations are cursed we need Jesus we need Jesus are you with me now I got a lot of stories I could tell right there but I got to go hmm the Israelites once settled and what they said what they were studying well I'm not worthy what else could I do you don't have to do nothing the only thing that you have to do is come under the shed blood the blood of Jesus Christ and that settles it once under the blood you're safe I don't cause you to take a deep breath what if the death angel with his sword in his hands sweeping the land you didn't have to wonder and to be scared to be scared was an insult to Jehovah if a man is once under the blood and feels afraid that God won't keep his word it's an insult Jehovah perhaps this is your word but I don't know whether it's right or not shame on you once under the blood he said I'm the Lord that healeth Thee I believe it that's all don't don't insult him he that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out I believe it once coming under the blood take the word take the word take the blood and every believer here it is get it every man and woman that that once has been under the blood of Jesus Christ all fear and condemnation is gone out then he will believe every word and God writes it in the Bible to be the truth he will not say this is not inspired and that's not inspired a Believer will believe every word of God all come to the Fountain that's filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins wonderful savior that we have What A Plan of Redemption that we have what a plan that Jehovah has allotted for us laid out the carpet for us and come home to him we as Humanity have our memory Chambers but if we're not careful as human beings we'll dig up bones if it's been forgiven and God can't remember it why do you want to dig it up [Applause] it'll do you no good to dig it up over and over and over and over again oh that's husband and wife never did up old boyfriends and old girlfriends never look back to the past is past past has been forgiven move forward can you imagine salmon which is the captain when he married Rahab that was a harlot listen once she's married to Sal Moon and she has been redeemed through the talking token and she has believed those two spies her and her whole household were saved because the token of Jesus Christ but listen I would dare say to you when she becomes the queen under salmon that Salomon never brought her past up are you with me now you need another there was a man named Boaz that redeemed Naomi because Ruth was a part of the plan of God she had a past she had a history she had been an idol worshiper in her land which according to the law she was cursed but God had a Plan of Redemption and he was showing it through Ruth and Tamar and and he was showing it through Rahab I am a worthy one I can redeem you as the Bride of Jesus Christ I can wash away your sins are you with me I don't want to get too far ahead but listen as our Kinsmen Redeemer he don't remind us of our past you ought to give the Lord a hand right there [Applause] Redemption is not a sins credit card where God redeems you and washes away your twenty five thousand dollar debt on your credit card it doesn't give you a license to go fill it back up again it doesn't give us a right to make Grace a disgrace what can wash away our sins it's more than just a song what can wash away our sins nothing but the blood of Jesus Christ thank you this world is now so polluted until I dread I dread looking at the news it's horrendous you know God knows that man can't clean the world up the world has become polluted we live in America to where that we're trying our very best along with a lot of other nations trying to clean the world listen that's like a man trying to clean himself up you can make vows you can make promises you can walk to the altar 52 times but if God don't come and change our nature we'll go right back to that hop here let's just be honest if God don't come and help us my prayer in my early life was God if you don't feel me with the Holy Ghost I'm going to go right back to what I used to be I don't need my mama's religion I don't need my daddy's religion I need a personal experience with Jesus Christ I need you to clean me I need you to go down through my allies and my Tin Can alleys I need you to watch me [Applause] oh since I've been born again the night I got saved I put a 12 pack of beer in a trash can I never went back to it again I've never had a desire again I never had to go to any classes I never had to go to any things I had a pornographic devil on me before I got saved God come and took that thing away [Applause] I want to tell you if you're living in that that situation in your life I want you to understand you're looking not only a miracle but God cleaned me listen I have been able to preach all over the world another never has my mind and my eyes thought a thought about lustful sisters are you with me listen God knows how to clean a man's life up that old nature is always there to bury on your height it's always there to burn your hat but

this week that your air was not pure some of you is probably hard to breathe they sent you out on your iPhone or your whatever phone that you've got and warns you don't exercise outside I didn't pay any attention to it but it was on my phone too because in Canada hey there was a fire burning out of control millions of Acres was on fire probably still on fire and unless the great rain comes it'll continue to be on fire it lets us know that this Fallen Earth even in his Fallen condition lightning bolts will hit trees and a fire will start the government will never clean it up they'll never clean it are you with me now oh but I trust Washington that's another three-hour sermon but I'm not going to preach that to you today we'll be in a cycle over the next year and a half that we wish that we could just fast forward whoever we get Republican Democrat Federalists whatever we get we'll never be able to live up to their promises we're not a Christian Nation no more we're not I I'm sorry we're just not we're in the minority now but it doesn't mean that we have to succumb are you with me we're in this world but not of this world we have a citizenship from another Nation who's Builder and maker is God Abraham met the king in the Hebrews chapter 11 said that he looked for a city whose Builder and maker was God why could you have such Faith to do that he met the king of that City we've met the king of that City uh don't you love the Lord we have an All-Seeing gun we think about we think about we think about I'll just tell this story brother biscoll has told it hundreds of times he said he was with brother Branham and he had three questions on this particular day they were going to kill some squirrels for for Camp meat so he said he actually asked brother Ed he said would you like to take a walk we need to kill some squirrels he said and after I walk with him a little while I realized that he really wasn't interested in hunting for squirrels he said he came to a place and sat down on a log and when he sat down on the log brother Eddie sat there and he said he put his knee up against him and and they begin to talk a little bit and then he he told him he said you have three questions brother Eddie was a young preacher he was somewhere in his early actually late 20s and there was some skepticism about about brother Branham he he had some thoughts because everybody was saying he was going off he was going off on the word he had an incredible Healing Ministry but he was he was going off on the word and was preaching that you know that Serpent's hate Doctrine he thought surely brother Brown can't be preaching now and so and so Eddie's now going to know brother Branham is more than just a preacher more than just the man but he's going to hear the voice behind The Voice and he's going to tell him me you've got three questions now God not only know your questions he's got the answer for you I'm really happy about that because I too had a lot of questions in my life and I'll be honest with you I don't know everything people call me with a question I go I don't know well brother on you ought to know listen if I knew everything I'd be the richest man in America because I'd buy the right stock and I'd be in the housing market when it's going and then I get out of it when it's I don't know everything so I still have to work yeah work work is a four-letter word but it's not a curse word [Applause] before that little visit was over he realized that God knew he's every thought he knew his every thought from that point brother Biscoe would begin to know that God knows the very secrets of our heart now let me just say this to you God knows you better than you know you because as your memory book will begin to go you'll forget a lot of your first chapters now he's standing in a prayer line and there's a lady there and as he's beginning to deal with this lady she she's there and he's beginning to talk to her you have a nervous condition well it's good to know that she has a nervous condition she knows that but now he's going to talk to her 40 years ago you got off of a school bus and a dog chased you down the road and it caused a nervous condition to come on you she didn't remember that that even happened you want a second part A lady that is actually sister branham's friend she had a really bad nervous condition all the time tore up she hung around sister Branham because it it made her feel strong and so and so she wanted to be prayed for it she wanted to be healed she wanted to get rid of this and so and so she said when brother Branham is there and he feels the angel of the Lord maybe he'll pray for you so one day that actually happened he called her into the room and he's sitting there talking to her and and he said I see many years ago when your husband was away at War you was with another man and it was in a certain car and he told her what the car was and you come real close to getting run over at a railroad Exchange and you don't remember it because Satan's actually hid it in your memory think about that but God knows it but I want you to just notice God don't throw her away [Applause] he's got a cure for it he's got a cure for it God just don't call it out for no reason at all he knows that's laying there so he's provided a blood [Music] I dare say there's some closets in this building today that haven't been open for a while and you don't want nobody to know so don't go get sanctimonious on me I know Humanity pretty well it was a man one time we had a Jericho March we got happy here we were shouting we were dancing and you know this guy got his family and wheeled them out of the building and you know he was all sanctimonious and self-righteous that was on a Saturday evening and so we went to Country Kitchen or country cooking back in the day and so we were sitting and we were sitting there and he said well I she saw me walk out last night we don't believe in that kind of worship and I didn't want my family to get influenced and and I wanted to get my children out as quickly as possible and we went out and and we don't want to be a part of any of that I said well okay okay I said the reason that you did that was last Tuesday evening you were sitting on your computer and you were looking at pornography and you got the computer cut off quick enough to when your wife began to walk in the room he went oh God his self-righteous Spirit didn't cover his sin you can know every scripture in the Bible are you with me now I'm gonna preach to you I've laid my Foundation now I'm going to preach to you you can know every scripture from not the eyes and cross the t's you can know the message all backwards and forwards but if it don't live don't tell me about your recipe I don't care how well you can cook if it don't live on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday or some people want to argue scriptures why waste your time I want to argue such generally people that want to argue the Bible are hiding something people that are getting self-righteous and want to go back to the law are really hiding something because the blood of Jesus Christ takes care of every sin it takes care of every sin help me Jesus the clock is flying and I got some ways to go brother Ron can you prove a couple things to me I'm glad you asked Jesus said he was the lord of the Sabbath so he has to prove it they brought a woman according to the law that should be murdered in the street you see she had been caught in the act of adultery and those priests didn't have a way to clean her but they did have a law they actually had scripture they had scripture and they said she should be stoned they actually did it as a temptation to Jesus what would he do with this adulterous woman if he is the lord of the Sabbath if he is the law living what will he do the law said she should be stoned she has been dragged into the street she has been brought from the Hog Pen of life and now she's been brought before the Messiah who knows all things anyway what will God do with me preachers men that knew the law from beginning to end to be a Pharisee they would roll up the Scrolls put a pin through it and the examination of you becoming a Pharisee was that you had to know every scripture that that pen went through say that would unqualify most of us sitting here today now Jesus didn't argue scripture with them I would probably disappoint them he didn't he didn't argue he didn't argue scripture with him he uh he did something very unusual and I'd say if I was the one standing there guilty of this law listen I'm in trouble I'm in real trouble I I don't know what he's going to do but I'm going to die in a few minutes these guys are not going to give me any Mercy they're not going to give me any Mercy I'll tell you what you're going to find about me I'm going to I'm going to give you more Mercy I've never found a stone to throw at you and here's why Jesus got down on the ground and before when he hit the ground Brother Ray he said he that is without sin cast the first stone now listen if Jesus could see her sin he could see theirs listen God's Fair he's really fair you remember you remember last week I did something I've never seen done sister Connie I've never seen it done I've never heard of it being done but God dealt with me immediately when I saw you sitting right there I took my coat off and I wrapped it around you I didn't know why matter of fact I was puzzled there's people in this building probably think what's he doing preacher took his coat off and wrapped it around you Andrew picked it up exactly what was happening when that child came home the father was looking for he went and got his robe [Applause] he wouldn't got his robe and wrapped it around him welcome home welcome home I don't care what kind of hold pen you've been in but welcome home I don't want to know your history but welcome home [Applause] thank you [Applause] I've been here as your pastor of 23 24 years none of you can say that I've asked you for your history none of you I'm not even interested oh well if that person is not right you need to kick him out of church oh no this is the place you need to be [Applause] this is your place and this ain't a halfway house this is a Transformation Center you stick around long enough you'll meet Jesus you'll become a pillar of this church he'll change your life Hallelujah [Applause] Jesus wrote secret sins on them and they knew he knew and they knew that if I kill her with a stone that I'm guilty of murder if he's home if he's whole if he knows what my sin is and then I cast the stone I'm guilty a murderer listen don't never murder people with your tongue that thing right there is dangerous instead of talking about people pray for him instead of criticize and pray for them Life's Too Short look over at your neighbor life's short I don't have time to go back and tell the story tonight though life's short you getting off at the next stop life's short and Jesus finishes he looks up he asked an incredible question woman where is thine accusers now I'm coming too close woman where is thy accuser and she said I have none Lord now he's getting ready to say something or change her life neither do I accuse you now you don't agree and shouting I want you to know right now is a good time to shout [Applause] we read about there's going to be a new city I don't think any of us can fathom on Earth where that grass Never Dies and trees never shed a leaf we're dear do not have an enemy against them Where Eagles come and land on your shoulder we're a lion that can scream to where that it shakes the whole jungle we're a lion lays down with a laugh well there's no sin we're going to a city where there's no beer joints oh we got a king but we're gonna love him nobody has to run for mayor nobody has to be the representative of you as a matter of fact you can go to the king and spend some time with him he's been waiting on you let me tell you some more about this city as I wind down in this city there's no glasses there's not a rehab center there's not a hospital there's not a doctor there in that profession gonna be a lot of them there but they ain't gonna have to doctor on nobody because everybody's healed honey you won't have to be a lawyer there won't be no crime won't be in prison because all that bunch of them being cast into hell God didn't cast them there but they tossed themselves there Russia's prisons are just about empty because they're sending them to war I don't agree with the Russia but that's a pretty good idea let them know good go try to do something good in that City there's not going to be an argument there's not going to be a fuss brother Greg this is really good right here man's walking through heaven and there him and his wife is enjoying all the beauty all the love the atmosphere and he looked over at her and he said if it hadn't been for that diet that you had me on we'd have been here five years ago thank you some of you get it today so maybe you'll get it tomorrow some of you never get it Romans chapter 8 and verse one I got one scripture that I want to you mind if I just stop and pick this up next week I'm doing all right listen I've found out something about the word it'll never spoil it won't spoil but if I give you pieces at a time you'll get it Romans chapter 8 and verse 1. in chapter 7 I'll just quote these things to you Paul says Wretched Man that I am he talks about how horrible he is in his flesh in his flesh but through the blood of Jesus Christ he can say this therefore let's read it together there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh so let me just say this to you if you're free from your sin quit bringing it up mankind has been married and I want to I just want to share this with you we're getting ready to have our 40th anniversary brother Thomas congratulations 50 years Barbara too Barbara too [Applause] he didn't do that all by himself Thomas told me one time we were cutting wood and splitting it in the woods and he stopped splitting and he he said now Ron we were dating she really loves you and he told me these words don't hurt her three years ago I prayed a prayer I prayed a prayer that said Lord when they were giving me four months to live I said Lord let me live to when we're married 40 years I want to say thank you thank you God [Applause] yeah I bought her that ring she ain't got it yet but I bought her that ring she needs a ring a necklace new robe for putting up with me all these years but the Lord knew what kind of person she was she's going to need all this preaching [Applause] give her a good hand [Applause] I have a point to that we don't bring up each other's past she felt the same enemy that I fought and that was the devil so we don't sit at the table and talk about our weaknesses or our failures of what we did before we were married we don't do that matter of fact we don't bring up each other's failures I was at the doctor this last week he's a bow tie doctor he's a teacher and he was telling other doctors he said no I want you to look Ron's lost about 50 pounds and he said it's one of his number one complaints is he don't have strength he has a hard time with strength keeping strength and he was explaining to those doctors he said this he said we gave him certain medicines to help him because we knew he would have a lack of strength so we brought him from from the 220s to the 170s so he can carry him I thought boy that's a sermon you see God knew that we couldn't carry those sins we couldn't constantly carry those sins so he gave us a toxin a medicine that could get him off of us are you with me now I'm done I'm just giving you some freebie stuff here it's kind of like a free dessert to him you don't have to carry your memory anymore just give it to Jesus you don't have to constantly beat yourself anymore brother Ron I need a scripture I got one take those beset in sins and put them aside that lay them down lay them down and run [Applause] Ryan finished
