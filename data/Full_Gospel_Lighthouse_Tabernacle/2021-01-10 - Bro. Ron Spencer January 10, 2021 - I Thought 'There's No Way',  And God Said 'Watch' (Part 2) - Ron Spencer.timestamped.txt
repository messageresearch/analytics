[43:42] we're coming to the last sundays here on
[43:45] this realm
[43:47] we can see what's going on around us and
[43:50] we can see the world as it's making its

[44:21] amen the world's doing their nonsense
[44:24] and all of that and

[44:30] in administration

[44:44] regardless of who they are and what
[44:45] affiliation they are
[44:47] you just move right into that because i
[44:49] want this world to be as peaceable as it
[44:51] can be until we get to leave
[44:53] but we can see the transitioning
[44:58] of the end of the gentile dispensation
[45:01] and

[46:13] scriptures that i want to read
[46:15] as we begin this this morning and we
[46:18] love you with all of our hearts
[46:23] amen amen you love the lord
[46:30] the stone which the builders refused
[46:34] is become the head of the corner
[46:37] this is the lord's doing
[46:40] and it is marvelous in our eyes
[46:44] i want you to catch that scripture this
[46:47] is the lord's doing
[46:49] and it is marvelous in our eyes
[46:52] this is the day which the lord hath
[46:56] made we will rejoice
[47:00] and be glad in it in matthew chapter 13
[47:04] and verse
[47:05] 11 if you will turn there with me this
[47:07] morning
[47:08] or sister crystal
[47:13] matthew 11 or 13 verse 11.
[47:17] now he's speaking to his disciples now
[47:21] so he's speaking to you and he answered
[47:24] and said unto them
[47:26] because it is given unto you to know the
[47:28] mysteries
[47:30] of the kingdom of god
[47:33] that's quite a statement it's given unto
[47:36] you
[47:38] to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[47:41] god
[47:43] but to them it is not given
[47:48] for whosoever hath to him
[47:51] shall be given and he shall have
[47:55] more abundance but whosoever hath
[47:58] not from him shall be taken away
[48:03] even that he hath therefore
[48:06] speak i to them in parables
[48:09] because they seeing
[48:12] see not hearing
[48:16] hear not neither do they understand
[48:21] he's simply saying they have their
[48:23] denominational filter
[48:28] they have their pharisees sadducee
[48:30] filter
[48:32] their baptist whatever filter
[48:35] and cannot see the opening of the word
[48:38] same scriptures can't see it
[48:46] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[48:48] isaiah
[48:50] which saith by hearing ye shall hear
[48:53] and shall not understand and see and ye
[48:55] shall see and shall not perceive
[48:58] for this people's heart is wax gross
[49:02] and their eyes are their ears are dull
[49:05] of hearing
[49:06] and their eyes they have closed lester
[49:09] anytime they should see with their eyes
[49:12] and with their ear here with their ears
[49:14] and should understand with their heart
[49:17] and
[49:17] should be converted and i should heal
[49:21] them
[49:22] blessed are your eyes
[49:26] i would like for you to grab that
[49:29] blessed are your eyes
[49:32] for they see your ears
[49:37] for they hear for verily i say unto you
[49:41] that
[49:41] many prophets and righteous men have
[49:44] desired to see these things those things
[49:47] which you see
[49:50] and and have not seen them and to hear
[49:53] those things which you
[49:54] hear and have not heard them
[49:58] you may be seated may the lord bless in
[50:00] the reading of his word
[50:02] amen god bless you god bless you this
[50:05] morning
[50:07] in first john chapter one and this is
[50:09] going to be a thing
[50:11] first john chapter 1 and verse 1.
[50:16] that which was from the beginning which
[50:18] you have heard
[50:20] which we have seen with our eyes
[50:23] which we have looked upon
[50:26] and our hands have handled of the word
[50:29] of
[50:29] life for the life was manifested and we
[50:33] seen it and bear witness
[50:38] so they stood there in the prophecy of
[50:41] it
[50:43] and their eyes saw the fulfillment of it
[50:47] catch it now one thing for it to be
[50:50] prophecy
[50:51] and you grab a hold of the revelation of
[50:53] that
[50:54] another thing for you to stand in the
[50:57] fulfillment of that prophecy
[50:59] and grab a hold of that
[51:03] and then after the event you become the
[51:07] witnesses
[51:13] the witnesses of it now you'll remember
[51:17] only just a few days ago we were
[51:19] we were in the season of a christmas
[51:21] season
[51:22] and we spoke to you of how that those
[51:24] shepherds
[51:26] wyatt had to be shepherds
[51:29] and these shepherds were in the field
[51:31] and angels came
[51:34] listen that's never been recorded ever
[51:36] before in history
[51:39] angels came and visited those shepherds
[51:43] and those shepherds received the most
[51:46] triumphant
[51:47] news that ever was in the history of
[51:50] humanity
[51:51] that the savior is born this day
[51:56] something had to be in their heart to
[51:58] grab a hold of that
[52:00] visitation first of all that they could
[52:03] believe the visitation
[52:06] then receive the message of the hour
[52:09] and then make the journey to where the
[52:12] babe was prophesied to be born at
[52:15] are you with me now greater than a gps
[52:19] god led them to the exact stable
[52:25] and it was exactly like the angel
[52:28] said i like it how accurate
[52:32] god is when we
[52:35] had a messenger here on the scene and he
[52:37] would say and your name is so-and-so
[52:40] that's right and you're living so and so
[52:43] that's right and you're praying for a
[52:46] baby
[52:47] that's right it's your daughter's baby
[52:50] that's right and they live and they
[52:53] would tell them where they would live
[52:55] up up to 20 some things
[52:58] in just a matter of a paragraph and not
[53:01] one of them wrong
[53:06] amen amen just this last
[53:09] was it last week or two weeks ago they
[53:12] measured the horns again
[53:14] in brother branham's library all you
[53:17] guys are hunters here
[53:19] and and they're still 42 inches
[53:25] and if you remember what brother biscuit
[53:27] said it hadn't they been 42 point
[53:30] a quarter i wouldn't have believed it
[53:33] he said i wouldn't be standing here
[53:35] today if it would have been off a
[53:36] quarter of an inch
[53:38] but because it was exactly 42 inches
[53:44] god's accurate in his word didn't he
[53:48] now watch this
[53:53] jesus jesus would say in
[53:56] luke chapter 9 and verse 23
[54:00] and he said unto them all if any man
[54:03] will come after me
[54:07] let him deny himself and take up his
[54:11] cross
[54:12] daily and follow me
[54:16] for whosoever will save his life shall
[54:19] lose it
[54:20] but whosoever will lose his life for my
[54:23] sake
[54:24] the same shall save it only jesus could
[54:27] say it quite like that
[54:30] for what is a man advantaged if he
[54:33] gained the whole world
[54:37] and lose himself or be a castaway
[54:43] i think one of the greatest wastes of
[54:46] our humanity
[54:48] is a wasted life
[54:53] are you with me and i'm not talking
[54:55] about what you attain with money
[54:58] or what you attain with power but to
[55:01] waste your life
[55:04] for whosoever shall be ashamed of me
[55:07] and of my words of him
[55:11] shall the son of man be ashamed
[55:15] and he shall come in his own glory and
[55:18] in his father's glory
[55:20] of the holy angels now i want to just
[55:23] capture these next words
[55:25] god bless you for being with us today
[55:29] but i will tell you of a truth
[55:33] that there be some standing here which
[55:36] shall not
[55:37] taste of death
[55:40] till they see the kingdom
[55:44] of are you god
[55:48] me now listen there was a lot of people
[55:50] standing there
[55:51] but they were not conscious of what was
[55:54] going on
[55:57] are you with me now listen listen we
[56:00] just had quite enough disturbance in
[56:01] washington this week
[56:03] but look past what you saw
[56:08] look past all of that there's a lot of
[56:11] transition that's going on in the world
[56:13] and jesus was standing there in great
[56:15] transition
[56:17] listen the greatest king that ever lived
[56:19] was standing there with his disciples
[56:21] and said some of you that are standing
[56:24] here
[56:25] will not taste death
[56:28] until you see the kingdom
[56:32] are you with me hundreds of people no
[56:35] doubt
[56:35] heard those words but they were not
[56:39] conscious that the kingdom redemption
[56:43] was getting ready to take place
[56:47] are you with me you're talking about a
[56:49] riot
[56:51] when they take jesus and they have
[56:53] barabbas on one side and jesus on the
[56:56] other
[56:57] jesus healed many of those people sick
[57:01] many of those people he fed them and and
[57:05] and literally spoke to them and they saw
[57:07] the miracles
[57:09] but the spirit of the movement of that
[57:12] day
[57:13] scream for free barabbas
[57:17] what shall we do with this man crucify
[57:19] him
[57:25] now let me just say this to you don't
[57:27] get yourself all worked up with the
[57:28] politics of things
[57:33] those disciples that were standing there
[57:35] if they could only be conscious
[57:38] this is the way that it's supposed to be
[57:44] no doubt as they looked at the neighbors
[57:47] your child was healed
[57:49] how could you be screaming crucify him
[57:56] just only a few days ago you pulled palm
[57:58] branches down
[58:02] but the disciples knew where they were
[58:06] standing
[58:09] mary with a visitation now past 30 years
[58:14] she knew she visited was visited by an
[58:16] angel
[58:20] sometimes you think well i've got to
[58:22] have a hundred people around me to
[58:23] crutch me up and know the same thing
[58:25] let me just say you and god are a
[58:27] majority
[58:30] and when the devil comes to you and
[58:32] you're all by yourself and
[58:34] you're being beat around the stump by
[58:37] the enemy
[58:38] you take him back to the spot to where
[58:41] you met god
[58:45] you take him back to the event you know
[58:48] that you met god
[58:51] you don't need a psychologist to tell
[58:53] you that you know that he
[58:55] changed your life and let me just say
[58:59] this to you
[59:00] it didn't take him 10 years to do it
[59:04] it didn't take him had been taking
[59:06] sending you through
[59:07] all kind of analytics and all kinds of
[59:09] things to do it
[59:10] in a moment
[59:14] in a moment you went from being one life
[59:17] to another life
[59:18] [Applause]
[59:23] how do you explain the supernatural
[59:25] birth
[59:27] it's kind of like walking out of a
[59:29] phenomenal service and
[59:30] you've shouted you spoke in tongues
[59:33] you've been
[59:34] moved by the presence of god and then
[59:36] you go to burger king
[59:38] how do you explain to the man behind the
[59:41] counter
[59:41] and get him to get a reality of the
[59:44] atmosphere that you've just been in
[59:47] but you know that you know that you
[59:50] know that you've experienced another
[59:53] level with god
[1:00:07] and jesus said in verse 58 he said foxes
[1:00:09] have holes
[1:00:11] birds have nests but the son of man hath
[1:00:15] not were to lay his head
[1:00:18] yet he owned it all
[1:00:23] and in your consciousness of the things
[1:00:25] that you have
[1:00:26] that could be taken away by a hospital
[1:00:29] bill
[1:00:31] taken away by by simply politics
[1:00:34] or simply just life
[1:00:38] so foxes have holes birds have nests
[1:00:45] are you with me and i preached in places
[1:00:47] where
[1:00:48] that i lay i laid on dirt floors
[1:00:52] didn't bother me whatsoever jesus did
[1:00:55] that
[1:00:56] but let me just say this to you this is
[1:00:59] not our home
[1:01:02] [Applause]
[1:01:04] this is only a temporary this is only a
[1:01:07] temporary existence
[1:01:10] [Applause]
[1:01:13] the son of man had no place to lay his
[1:01:16] head
[1:01:21] and he said unto one to another
[1:01:24] follow me
[1:01:31] now this i'm not talking about two
[1:01:33] thousand years ago
[1:01:34] follow me i want to talk to you about
[1:01:38] your commitment just now
[1:01:42] because some people follow only by
[1:01:44] association
[1:01:47] or by convenience
[1:01:50] or if it's working out well but god
[1:01:53] wants your whole heart
[1:01:58] he wants your everything are you with me
[1:02:02] now
[1:02:02] he wants your whole life
[1:02:14] watch what he does
[1:02:19] and jesus said unto him no man
[1:02:24] having put his hand to the plow
[1:02:28] and looking back is fit for the kingdom
[1:02:35] a couple weeks ago we had three speakers
[1:02:38] in one service
[1:02:41] and they it was a kind of a theme don't
[1:02:43] look back
[1:02:45] lot's wife looked back i think of all of
[1:02:48] the testament scriptures that jesus
[1:02:50] talks about
[1:02:51] in the old testament he mentions one
[1:02:54] woman
[1:02:55] in the revealing of the son of man
[1:02:58] he says remember lot's wife
[1:03:06] so jesus gives us a warning
[1:03:10] he gives us a warning and if you i'm not
[1:03:13] going to go there but
[1:03:14] if you'll remember melchizedek spent
[1:03:16] time with abraham
[1:03:18] and abraham negotiated if there's 50
[1:03:21] there can you spare the city
[1:03:23] orpha's 40 or first 30 or first 20
[1:03:26] we could say the same thing about
[1:03:28] america
[1:03:30] or any other nation god could you spare
[1:03:32] it
[1:03:35] god could you spare it but there came a
[1:03:38] time where the negotiation phase was
[1:03:40] over
[1:03:41] and the angel went to get abraham's
[1:03:44] family and and and
[1:03:48] and lot and his wife and his daughters
[1:03:51] left but can you imagine the
[1:03:55] the state of the spirituality of lot
[1:04:00] when sodom and gomorrah was screaming
[1:04:02] for those two
[1:04:03] angels that they could come and and have
[1:04:06] relationship with those angels
[1:04:10] lot offered them his daughters
[1:04:15] let me just say no matter how bad this
[1:04:17] world is
[1:04:19] make sure you've got a holy ghost token
[1:04:22] over your home
[1:04:25] i refuse to give up my children and my
[1:04:28] grandchildren
[1:04:33] that's the greatest lineage that we can
[1:04:35] have
[1:04:36] in this day
[1:04:44] talking about being fit we've just
[1:04:46] transitioned into a new year
[1:04:50] and a lot of people want to go get fit
[1:04:53] they want to transform their bodies in a
[1:04:55] matter of six to eight weeks and
[1:04:59] try a new diet
[1:05:14] but i think for our heavenly experience
[1:05:16] i think there's a real
[1:05:20] fitness
[1:05:22] would you actually fit in the kingdom of
[1:05:24] heaven
[1:05:28] would you actually fit not just fitness
[1:05:32] would you actually fit
[1:05:38] man said i i'm going to take my tobacco
[1:05:41] to heaven with me
[1:05:43] and the preacher said you'll have to go
[1:05:44] to hell to spite
[1:05:52] in a place where there's no sin and no
[1:05:54] lying and no cheating
[1:05:58] you can't take your adulterous
[1:06:00] atmosphere with you
[1:06:03] in a place to where that that is
[1:06:06] absolutely peace you can't take this
[1:06:09] political atmosphere
[1:06:11] with you listen our king is king
[1:06:20] hallelujah and that will not change for
[1:06:23] the eternities
[1:06:28] in psalms chapter 68 and i want to go to
[1:06:31] the passion
[1:06:32] translation if i can do this for you if
[1:06:35] you can be patient with me in verse 19
[1:06:37] it says what a glorious god
[1:06:40] he gives us salvation over and over
[1:06:43] then daily he carries our burdens
[1:06:47] paul's in his presence
[1:06:50] our god is mighty god who saves us over
[1:06:53] and over
[1:06:54] for the lord yahweh rescues us
[1:06:57] from the ways of death many times
[1:07:02] oh i love this next verse but he will
[1:07:05] crush every enemy
[1:07:10] shattering their strength he will make
[1:07:13] heads roll
[1:07:15] come on preach with me he will make
[1:07:18] heads rule
[1:07:20] for they refuse to repent of their
[1:07:22] stubborn and sinful ways
[1:07:25] now let me just let me just say this to
[1:07:27] you if we reflect
[1:07:29] our father if we're
[1:07:32] part of god and we reflect our father
[1:07:35] how much more are we passionate about
[1:07:38] destroying the enemy
[1:07:41] because you have got to destroy him or
[1:07:44] he will destroy
[1:07:45] you your your petty
[1:07:49] petty sins that you fool with and just
[1:07:51] pamper along
[1:07:54] and
[1:07:57] do you know that the the stubbornness
[1:07:59] and
[1:08:00] jealousy are you
[1:08:03] actually your enemy
[1:08:08] you just come through the christmas
[1:08:09] season
[1:08:13] and sometimes somebody got a better
[1:08:15] present than you did
[1:08:19] and you remember when you were little
[1:08:22] you kind of felt a little something roll
[1:08:24] up in you
[1:08:26] you grew up and kind of got over that
[1:08:28] thing
[1:08:32] but you watch grown-ups if they're not
[1:08:35] really born again they'll get
[1:08:36] jealous
[1:08:41] come on church they'll get jealous of
[1:08:43] one another
[1:08:45] jealous of power jealous of this or that
[1:08:50] are you with me now
[1:08:52] well god's better than them than they
[1:08:54] are to me
[1:08:56] you don't understand the economy of god
[1:09:00] are you with me it's more blessed to
[1:09:02] give than to receive
[1:09:05] hallelujah
[1:09:08] are you with me now
[1:09:15] this is more than about a little john
[1:09:17] deere tractor
[1:09:20] playing around on the floor god wants
[1:09:23] you to conquer that enemy in your life
[1:09:29] all right unless you can see your
[1:09:31] brother blessed
[1:09:33] how can you be blessed
[1:09:34] [Applause]
[1:09:36] you want forgiveness yet you won't
[1:09:40] forgive
[1:09:43] you want mercy but you don't want to
[1:09:46] give mercy
[1:09:48] who are you preaching to somebody
[1:09:52] somebody are you with me now poor people
[1:09:54] on the internet maybe it's them
[1:09:59] forgiveness as you place it into the
[1:10:01] justification
[1:10:02] file as though it never happened in the
[1:10:04] first place
[1:10:06] are you with me no mortal has a right to
[1:10:08] stand in the presence of god
[1:10:10] and condemn another mortal is that right
[1:10:21] sometimes we just need to get over
[1:10:23] ourself
[1:10:25] because our self is the biggest enemy
[1:10:28] well brother ron you were talking about
[1:10:30] prophecy and fulfillment just a few
[1:10:32] moments ago
[1:10:33] but you've got to be fit
[1:10:38] to be able to when you're standing at
[1:10:40] the moment realize
[1:10:42] that this day this scripture is
[1:10:44] fulfilled in your ears
[1:10:49] rapture's imminent it's absolutely
[1:10:52] imminent we've looked for it for 2
[1:10:56] 000 years and now it's just imminent
[1:11:10] this has always been one of my favorite
[1:11:12] scriptures
[1:11:14] but especially in this phase of my life
[1:11:16] it's taken on new meaning as a stage
[1:11:26] four
[1:11:29] you know stage four puts a different
[1:11:32] perspective on everything
[1:11:37] you know i hear people i hear prayer
[1:11:38] requests come across the pulpit go
[1:11:42] they're they're thinking it might be
[1:11:43] cancer
[1:11:45] and there's a fear you can almost sense
[1:11:47] it in the prayer request

[1:12:40] interesting case

[1:12:44] doctors
[1:12:48] and i appreciate them they've actually
[1:12:49] given me some help this week
[1:12:51] but i appreciate them but i got another
[1:12:54] doctor
[1:12:57] and he's a high physician and he cares
[1:13:02] and he's a faithful high priest that can
[1:13:05] be touched with the feeling of
[1:13:07] of our infirmities
[1:13:09] [Applause]
[1:13:16] paul writes this
[1:13:19] talking about commitment paul writes the
[1:13:22] adoption chapter
[1:13:24] of romans in a prison
[1:13:30] inspired in a prison and i want you to
[1:13:33] listen to these words
[1:13:35] through a different focus
[1:13:38] as though this is the last service for
[1:13:44] you
[1:13:47] and we know all things work together
[1:13:51] for good to them that love god
[1:13:56] you mean bad things happen to me it's
[1:13:58] good for me
[1:14:04] hallelujah do you know cancer
[1:14:07] no matter how wicked and terrible it is
[1:14:09] it's only a tool in the hand of god
[1:14:12] but it drove me into a higher
[1:14:15] walk with god so i can tell mr
[1:14:19] sloughfoot himself it was good for me
[1:14:25] there's no way the devil can understand
[1:14:28] that
[1:14:29] that god used him in my life
[1:14:32] to bring me closer to him
[1:14:44] for all things work together for good to
[1:14:47] them that love god
[1:14:49] to them or who are they called according
[1:14:51] to his purpose
[1:14:54] are you with me now hang on to that his
[1:14:55] purpose for whom he did for no
[1:14:58] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:15:01] to the image of his son
[1:15:03] that he might be the firstborn
[1:15:06] among many brethren moreover whom he did
[1:15:09] predestinate
[1:15:11] then he also called now watch how god
[1:15:15] operates
[1:15:16] yesterday today and forever god's
[1:15:19] eternal
[1:15:19] he sees way back there and he sees way
[1:15:22] up yonder
[1:15:24] for them he called him he also called
[1:15:26] them he also justified
[1:15:28] as though it never happened to you in
[1:15:30] the first place
[1:15:31] your slate is clean
[1:15:33] [Applause]
[1:15:35] and god in his infinite mind don't even
[1:15:37] remember it anymore
[1:15:39] and whom he justified them he also
[1:15:41] glorified
[1:15:43] what shall we then say to these things
[1:15:45] if god before
[1:15:47] us who can be against us
[1:16:00] [Applause]
[1:16:06] he that spared not his own son but
[1:16:08] delivered him up for us
[1:16:10] all how shall we how shall he
[1:16:13] not with him freely give us all things
[1:16:16] he's not holding nothing back from you
[1:16:20] you're going to get it all you inherit
[1:16:22] the whole kingdom of god
[1:16:25] and neither spared not his own son but
[1:16:27] delivered him up for us
[1:16:28] how shall he not with him freely give us
[1:16:31] all things
[1:16:33] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:16:35] god's elect
[1:16:36] it is god that justifieth who is he that
[1:16:39] condemneth it is christ that died
[1:16:41] ye rather is risen again who is even at
[1:16:44] the right hand of god
[1:16:46] who maketh intercession for us all
[1:16:55] who shall separate us
[1:16:59] from the love of christ shall
[1:17:02] tribulation
[1:17:03] or distress or persecution
[1:17:07] or famine or nakedness or peril
[1:17:10] or sword or cancer or sugar divide us
[1:17:16] or paralyzed or dementia all of none of
[1:17:20] that will separate us from the love of
[1:17:22] god
[1:17:28] as it is written for thy sake we're
[1:17:30] killed all the day long and we're
[1:17:31] accounted as sheep for the slaughter
[1:17:34] nay in all of these things we may have
[1:17:37] had to go through a lot of things in our
[1:17:39] life
[1:17:40] but nay and all of these things
[1:17:44] we are more than conquerors through him
[1:17:48] that loved us
[1:17:52] hallelujah not in your ability
[1:17:56] but in his ability
[1:18:00] i can do all things through christ jesus
[1:18:07] this is a man writing from a dungeon for
[1:18:09] i am persuaded
[1:18:15] hallelujah listen the sword was being
[1:18:18] sharpened and getting ready he knew
[1:18:19] where he was headed
[1:18:21] for i am persuaded that neither death
[1:18:23] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[1:18:26] nor powers nor things presence
[1:18:28] nor things to come nor
[1:18:31] height nor death nor any other creature
[1:18:33] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:18:35] love of god
[1:18:36] which is in christ jesus our
[1:18:40] lord why is it written like that he's
[1:18:44] not your lord unless you make him your
[1:18:46] lord
[1:18:47] he's not your king unless you make him
[1:18:49] your king
[1:18:50] he's not your god unless you make him
[1:18:53] your god
[1:18:56] first thessalonians chapter 4 written by
[1:18:58] the same writer for
[1:19:00] but i would not have you to be ignorant
[1:19:02] brethren
[1:19:03] concerning them which are asleep that
[1:19:05] you saw not even as others which have no
[1:19:07] hope
[1:19:08] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:19:10] rose again even so them
[1:19:13] also which sleep in jesus will god bring
[1:19:15] with him for this we say unto you by the
[1:19:17] word of the lord
[1:19:19] that we which are alive and remain under
[1:19:21] the coming of the lord
[1:19:23] shall not prevent
[1:19:27] them which are asleep for the lord
[1:19:30] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:19:32] shout
[1:19:33] and with the voice of the archangel and
[1:19:36] the trump of god
[1:19:37] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:19:40] then we which are alive and remain
[1:19:44] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:19:46] the clouds
[1:19:47] to meet the lord in the air
[1:19:51] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[1:19:54] now notice these next words wherefore
[1:19:57] comfort one another with these words
[1:20:04] an american we're a young nation
[1:20:07] can i get some water as an american
[1:20:09] we're a young nation so our
[1:20:11] graves will not hold a thousand
[1:20:14] thousand your grave we don't have
[1:20:18] two thousand year graves here in america
[1:20:21] that we know of i'm sure there's some
[1:20:23] but
[1:20:26] most of our graves our cemeteries around
[1:20:29] here are
[1:20:29] up to a couple hundred years old names
[1:20:32] on them and
[1:20:33] dates of life on them dashes on them
[1:20:40] but when you go to europe and some of
[1:20:43] the other countries and you
[1:20:44] go through the cemetery
[1:20:47] and i went through columbus in ireland
[1:20:50] cemetery to where that's where his
[1:20:52] church was and
[1:20:54] there's 1400 year old graves
[1:20:59] this scripture pertains to them as well
[1:21:07] brother matters you we just married your
[1:21:09] wife this scripture pertains to her
[1:21:14] are you with me listen she's going to
[1:21:17] get up out of that grave
[1:21:19] or step from that dimension as a young
[1:21:23] woman
[1:21:26] but so is the 1400 year old grave
[1:21:29] [Applause]
[1:21:31] that's already went back to the ashes in
[1:21:34] the gashes
[1:21:35] or maybe even the scripture says that
[1:21:37] the sea
[1:21:38] will give up her death the hugest
[1:21:41] graveyard
[1:21:42] in the world is the ocean and the word
[1:21:45] of god is a prophecy
[1:21:49] it's not an if
[1:21:53] it's not a forecast like the weather
[1:21:55] it's going to happen
[1:21:57] there's going to come a resurrection
[1:22:02] like there was going to come a messiah
[1:22:10] are you with me you got just a few more
[1:22:13] minutes for me to preach
[1:22:14] to you
[1:22:17] i want you to come back you you got to
[1:22:20] come back
[1:22:21] i believe i could preach to you all day
[1:22:23] long
[1:22:24] [Applause]
[1:22:32] we're friends i want you to know that
[1:22:36] amen now let's just let's just capture
[1:22:40] something just for a few minutes
[1:22:42] that's him that was him in creation
[1:22:51] that was him because he's identified by
[1:22:54] his characteristics
[1:22:56] that's him when he said let there be
[1:23:02] i wanted today maybe ronald get a trip
[1:23:05] one day and
[1:23:06] i'll have a personal day with him and
[1:23:08] he'll say would you like to see how it
[1:23:10] was all created
[1:23:11] oh yeah i'd like to add do i need a
[1:23:14] space suit
[1:23:14] no
[1:23:19] there's three or four stars it's even
[1:23:21] together now as you can see i think it's
[1:23:22] four stars that you can actually see in
[1:23:24] the sky right now
[1:23:26] and there there are four planets and you
[1:23:28] can see them in the sky it's just a
[1:23:29] beautiful scene
[1:23:31] i've seen pictures of it but i
[1:23:32] personally haven't seen it yet but
[1:23:34] but you know he made that
[1:23:39] now you see when he wrote his first
[1:23:42] bible he didn't put it on parchment
[1:23:44] paper
[1:23:46] so he so he wrote it in the sky
[1:23:52] and so he began to speak the zodiac into
[1:23:55] existence
[1:23:57] that was him
[1:24:01] so he spoke leo the the lion
[1:24:06] and the stars that would make it all up
[1:24:09] and he would place it there so enoch
[1:24:11] when he was on earth
[1:24:13] could look up and see it because he
[1:24:16] wouldn't have this
[1:24:18] but he would know the author because
[1:24:21] that's him
[1:24:26] are you with me he had a purpose in his
[1:24:30] creation that's him
[1:24:35] that was him in a cradle
[1:24:40] that was him laying wrapped in swaddling
[1:24:43] clothes
[1:24:46] that was him
[1:24:53] we believe that
[1:24:56] that's him in the mystery of his birth
[1:25:00] it was him that prophesied through the
[1:25:02] prophets
[1:25:03] for hundreds of years and then he came
[1:25:07] and they missed him
[1:25:10] but that was still him i know i'm
[1:25:13] elementary now
[1:25:15] that was him that had gabriel to speak
[1:25:19] to a little girl
[1:25:22] we have guesstimates of how old she was
[1:25:24] but she wasn't an old girl she was
[1:25:26] probably in her adolescence she was
[1:25:28] probably
[1:25:28] in her teenage years but god spoke to
[1:25:32] her
[1:25:33] he didn't go to a thousand women to pick
[1:25:35] a womb
[1:25:36] he went to one girl
[1:25:41] because that's him and
[1:25:44] and she said be it unto me according
[1:25:49] to your words now i want to get to my
[1:25:53] title now
[1:25:54] mary didn't have to do anything
[1:25:57] but take him at his work
[1:26:04] so let's just watch this simply
[1:26:08] watch
[1:26:12] she goes home and tells joseph she
[1:26:15] doesn't have to convince
[1:26:16] joseph an angel comes and visits him
[1:26:21] she goes to elizabeth and tells her
[1:26:24] testimony
[1:26:25] and the baby in her womb which was the
[1:26:28] preceding prophet for this one
[1:26:32] would come to life when his name is
[1:26:35] spoken
[1:26:37] so she watched resurrection power
[1:26:41] at his name
[1:26:49] she knew i i feel like preaching she
[1:26:52] knew that she had not laid with some
[1:26:56] roman soldier
[1:26:59] she knew that joseph had not defiled her
[1:27:04] she knew that and she knew that that
[1:27:07] holy visitation had spawned something in
[1:27:10] her womb
[1:27:12] and now it was growing
[1:27:21] and month after month she watched
[1:27:26] that holy thing are you doing
[1:27:34] you're watching the word transform your
[1:27:37] life
[1:27:41] when you can't hold yourself
[1:27:46] when you can't hold yourself you would
[1:27:49] have quit
[1:27:50] if you could have you would have turned
[1:27:53] back if you could have
[1:27:55] but you just stood and watched that
[1:27:58] supernatural presence of
[1:28:00] god in the loaf himself in your
[1:28:03] life it's preparing you for a rapture
[1:28:12] hallelujah
[1:28:24] oh brother ron what if i go by the way
[1:28:26] of the grave
[1:28:27] just watch just watch
[1:28:31] i says this last breath breathe out of
[1:28:35] your life
[1:28:36] you just watch this is not the end
[1:28:40] but you you'll go through a change from
[1:28:43] this body to another body
[1:28:46] and your last breath here is your first
[1:28:48] breath there
[1:28:54] and cancer don't have a hope of you no
[1:28:56] more
[1:28:57] it can't hold you no more it can't
[1:29:01] defeat you no more
[1:29:06] mortals shall take on immortality and
[1:29:09] then
[1:29:10] shall be brought together the change of
[1:29:12] this body
[1:29:13] [Applause]
[1:29:22] watch
[1:29:26] [Applause]
[1:29:32] that's him
[1:29:35] that was him in creation that was him in
[1:29:39] a manger
[1:29:40] that was him on the cross that was him
[1:29:43] on the day of pentecost
[1:29:44] but that's him here this morning
[1:29:59] all paul knew was when he met him on the
[1:30:01] road to damascus
[1:30:02] he could never be the same man
[1:30:06] all you know is when you meet him
[1:30:10] that i can never go back ever again
[1:30:16] but it's more than just an experience
[1:30:33] can i give you one more
[1:30:42] that's not as i was suffering in the
[1:30:46] night
