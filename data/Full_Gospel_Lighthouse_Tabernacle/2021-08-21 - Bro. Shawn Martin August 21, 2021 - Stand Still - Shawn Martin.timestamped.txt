[48:33] uh second chronicles the 20th chapter
[48:36] and i i want to start at the the first
[48:38] verse
[48:39] and read a few verses here
[48:42] uh but it says it came to pass after
[48:45] this also
[48:46] that the children of moab and the
[48:48] children of amen
[48:50] and with them other besides the
[48:52] ammonites came against jehoshaphat to
[48:55] battle
[48:57] then there came some that told
[49:00] jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great
[49:02] multitude against thee
[49:05] from beyond the sea on this side of
[49:07] syria
[49:09] and behold they be in
[49:12] that city there
[49:16] praise the lord
[49:19] i'm glad i live in reiner
[49:23] i've got to go to college to learn that
[49:25] one
[49:27] so
[49:28] uh and which is in in gedi
[49:32] and um and jehoshaphat feared
[49:35] and set himself to seek the lord and
[49:38] proclaim the fast throughout all judah
[49:42] and judah gathered themselves together
[49:44] to ask help of the lord even out of all
[49:47] the cities of judah
[49:48] they came to seek the lord
[49:51] and jehoshaphat stood in the
[49:53] congregation of judah and jerusalem in
[49:56] the house
[49:57] of the lord
[49:58] before the new court
[50:01] and he said uh unto uh and he said o
[50:06] lord god of our fathers
[50:08] are
[50:09] not thou god in heaven
[50:12] and rule us not thou over all the
[50:15] kingdoms of the heathen
[50:16] and in thine hand is there not power and
[50:19] might so that none
[50:20] is able to withstand thee
[50:23] i want to stop there and i'd like to go
[50:26] down to the the 14th
[50:28] verse
[50:30] it says then upon jehaziah
[50:34] if that's the right word uh the son of
[50:37] zechariah the son of anaya the son of
[50:40] jael
[50:41] the son of matania a levite of the sons
[50:45] of asaph
[50:47] came the spirit of the lord in the midst
[50:49] of the congregation and he said hearken
[50:52] ye all judah and the inhabitants of
[50:55] jerusalem
[50:56] and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the
[50:59] lord unto you
[51:01] be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of
[51:04] this great multitude
[51:06] for the battle is not yours but gods
[51:10] tomorrow go ye down against them behold
[51:12] they come up by the cliff of ziz
[51:15] and you shall find them at the end of
[51:18] the brook before the wilderness of
[51:20] jerusalem
[51:22] you shall not need to fight in this
[51:25] battle
[51:26] set yourselves stand ye still
[51:29] and see the salvation of the lord with
[51:32] you
[51:33] o judah and jerusalem fear not
[51:37] nor be dismayed
[51:39] tomorrow
[51:40] go out against them
[51:41] for the lord will be with you
[51:45] amen you can have your seats this
[51:47] evening
[51:49] i i just have a a simple thought
[51:53] and uh trust it'll uh help you tonight
[51:56] but
[51:57] the the just the thought of stan steele
[52:01] and i i think we could um kind of
[52:04] compare
[52:05] our
[52:08] conditions uh with
[52:10] the conditions that we just read we we
[52:13] see that
[52:14] israel is in a great crisis
[52:17] there's an invading army
[52:20] that is coming against them
[52:22] and you could just imagine this army
[52:25] it's um
[52:26] uh pretty
[52:28] they're they're bold they're they're
[52:30] coming at israel with great confidence
[52:34] that they're going to win the war
[52:36] uh
[52:37] they're determined to destroy
[52:39] god's people
[52:40] uh they they're they're well equipped
[52:43] they're outnumbering israel by by far
[52:47] and uh so really the odds are on their
[52:51] side um
[52:53] uh they they you know it's it's um uh so
[52:57] they're they're coming with great
[52:58] confidence and so you you could imagine
[53:02] israel
[53:03] in the situation that they understand as
[53:06] well
[53:07] that uh they're getting ready to get
[53:09] slaughtered they understand that the
[53:11] enemy is too great to even try to go out
[53:14] and fight them and and so it was a
[53:17] strenuous time for israel it was a time
[53:21] of of of
[53:23] you know frustration then and you know
[53:26] they were all just flustered and
[53:28] agitated and and con confused if you
[53:32] could say it that way
[53:33] and they didn't know which way to go
[53:35] they didn't know what to do they it it
[53:39] was a a great time just all tore up
[53:42] because of this army invading them and
[53:44] and the prophet the prophet tells us
[53:47] many times
[53:49] and notice how he said many times we all
[53:51] get to that place
[53:54] to where we can't stand still
[53:57] and we're nervous
[54:00] just as we start to do something good
[54:03] we see trouble coming
[54:05] can you say man
[54:06] now i know i see a lot of young people
[54:09] so i'm just going to take my time like i
[54:10] told you i'm not a great preacher like
[54:12] your pastor but so uh he's a wonderful
[54:15] minister and and but but he felt led to
[54:19] have us so i'm just going to just take
[54:21] my obey the lord and and be myself but i
[54:24] see a lot of you young people and and
[54:27] you know i i want to i want you to
[54:30] really ponder what the prophet is saying
[54:32] here is that when when we start to do
[54:35] something good
[54:37] evil is always present
[54:40] the moment you you try to move for god
[54:43] don't expect it to be an easy road
[54:46] don't don't expect it to be a life of
[54:48] these because it's not going to be a
[54:51] life of these
[54:52] it's it's because you're coming again
[54:55] you're coming to your victory you're
[54:57] coming to what god has has called you to
[55:00] be
[55:00] and satan's going to do everything
[55:03] possible to keep you from coming to what
[55:06] god has called you to be
[55:08] can you say amen
[55:10] so so we see this and i guarantee you
[55:13] that if you had your elders to stand up
[55:15] they could all testify that as when i
[55:18] start to pray the devil's go the devil's
[55:20] been there when i start to fast the
[55:22] devil's there when i when i start to
[55:24] find what god has called me to do
[55:27] devil's there to
[55:28] i meet resistance constantly
[55:31] when i set out to seek the holy oak
[55:33] there's a constant resistance can you
[55:35] say amen you're not always going to feel
[55:38] saved you're not always going to feel
[55:40] called you're not always going to feel
[55:42] like praying and the moment you start to
[55:44] pray and the moment you start to break
[55:47] through just know that the devil is
[55:49] right there
[55:50] to resist you
[55:51] [Applause]
[55:53] can you say amen
[55:54] god's people fat
[55:57] we are warriors can you say man amen
[56:00] that's right amen the moment you try to
[56:02] come into church and you get your mind
[56:05] on god just remember the devil's going
[56:07] to meet you right in your pew
[56:12] now we find amen now the prophet says as
[56:15] soon as we start to do something good we
[56:17] see trouble coming but that is the devil
[56:20] everybody say it's the devil
[56:22] trying to to upset the program of god
[56:26] and we find it in our individual lives
[56:29] and you're gonna find it in your own
[56:30] life you find it in the church world you
[56:33] find it in our national affairs you find
[56:36] it everywhere and then we know that when
[56:40] we are getting ready to do right wrong
[56:43] is always present
[56:46] ain't that right
[56:47] and a lot of times wrong isn't some evil
[56:49] picture a lot of the time it's enticing
[56:53] can you say amen
[56:55] but
[56:56] it's the enemy so we find a wrong is
[56:59] always present but the way to overcome
[57:02] that is to think in your heart which way
[57:05] god would have you to go and which is
[57:08] the best way and then stay with that way
[57:12] can you say man
[57:13] now thank god that there was a man named
[57:15] jehoshaphat a man that that in the midst
[57:19] of trouble in the midst of
[57:21] of of chaos and confusion and and and
[57:25] when trouble was everywhere and and
[57:27] defeat was looming over them he knew
[57:30] what it was to pray
[57:33] amen he didn't turn to anybody else he
[57:36] didn't find the blame in everybody else
[57:38] he got on his knees and he began to call
[57:41] out to god i think that's what we need
[57:44] today is a people that know how to pray
[57:49] can you say amen we need parents that
[57:51] know how to pray we need young people
[57:54] that know how to pray
[57:57] can you say amen amen psychologists
[58:00] ain't got the answer
[58:02] ain't that right
[58:04] amen but god has the answer
[58:06] and jehoshaphat began to pray unto the
[58:09] lord amen and and i i believe that
[58:12] prayer is so vital to our christian walk
[58:16] amen but i say to you prayer amen
[58:19] requires a submitted heart prayer
[58:22] requires a heart full of trust can you
[58:26] say amen it's a sign of submission to
[58:29] the lord it's a sign of recognition amen
[58:32] that god you know all things and i'm
[58:35] here trusting in your divine wisdom
[58:39] ain't that right
[58:41] oftentimes our prayer is filled with
[58:43] complaint
[58:44] god why are you doing this god why are
[58:46] you allowing this god i just don't
[58:48] understand god when are you going to do
[58:50] this and when are you going to help out
[58:52] here and i don't understand why you're
[58:54] allowing this and a lot of times it's
[58:57] full of complain amen when our prayer
[59:00] shouldn't be full of complain can you
[59:02] say man i understand humanly amen the
[59:05] satan puts them question marks and all
[59:08] of that but i look at jehoshaphat look
[59:10] at the prayer that he prayed it was a
[59:12] prayer of god you are god
[59:16] god you are mighty
[59:18] god you reign upon high
[59:21] can you say man
[59:23] amen he prayed
[59:25] unto god
[59:27] ain't that right
[59:29] let's look at the prayer
[59:30] ii chronicles 20 and 6
[59:33] oh lord
[59:34] god our of our fathers
[59:37] are not thou got in heaven
[59:39] he remembered that he was god in heaven
[59:42] amen and rulest
[59:44] thou over uh uh
[59:47] over all the kingdoms of the heathen
[59:49] in other words he's acknowledging that
[59:51] the heathen ain't coming to destroy him
[59:54] without god's allowing it
[59:57] you understand what i'm saying he
[59:59] recognized that the trouble that's
[1:00:01] coming god was in control
[1:00:04] god ain't amen the enemy ain't got
[1:00:06] anything over god you're troubling got
[1:00:08] anything over god who is a who is the
[1:00:11] sin what sin can put god in checkmate
[1:00:15] what sickness can put god in checkmate
[1:00:18] what trial that you go through can put
[1:00:21] god in checkmate
[1:00:23] whether you're up in the mountain or
[1:00:25] whether you're down in the valley he's
[1:00:27] still god
[1:00:30] do you believe it
[1:00:33] he's still god
[1:00:35] whether you're going in your darkest
[1:00:36] trial of your life he's still god
[1:00:40] nothing changes with god
[1:00:43] your trial may change your situation can
[1:00:45] change but nothing changes with god
[1:00:54] notice
[1:00:57] you not rule
[1:00:58] rule is thou not over
[1:01:00] all the kingdoms of the heathen
[1:01:02] and in thine hand
[1:01:04] is there not power and might
[1:01:07] so that none
[1:01:08] is able to withstand thee
[1:01:11] hallelujah
[1:01:13] how do you see god tonight
[1:01:15] do you see god on the throne
[1:01:19] do you see god is victorious
[1:01:23] can you say amen
[1:01:24] the enemy was right there you're going
[1:01:26] to destroy them but jehoshaphat looked
[1:01:29] at the almighty god
[1:01:31] you're still able to control these
[1:01:33] things you're still able to do whatever
[1:01:36] you will
[1:01:38] [Applause]
[1:01:40] now notice he says so that none will
[1:01:42] able is able to withstand thee
[1:01:45] are not thou our god
[1:01:47] who did us drive out the inhabitants of
[1:01:49] this land before thy people israel
[1:01:52] and gave us it to the seed of abraham
[1:01:54] thy friend forever
[1:01:56] and they dwelt therein and have built
[1:01:59] thee a sanctuary therein for thy name
[1:02:02] saying if when evie evil cometh upon us
[1:02:06] as the sword judgment pestilence or
[1:02:08] famine we stand before this house in my
[1:02:11] presence for thy name is in this house
[1:02:13] and cry
[1:02:15] unto thee
[1:02:16] in everybody say in
[1:02:19] our affliction
[1:02:21] then thou will hear
[1:02:23] and help
[1:02:25] he's not just a god when you're feeling
[1:02:28] good he's a god that will hear you in
[1:02:33] your affliction
[1:02:37] hello
[1:02:37] [Applause]
[1:02:41] i like how he puts that
[1:02:43] you'll hear us in our affliction
[1:02:46] why why would he put that gotta allow
[1:02:48] that
[1:02:49] because it's usually an affliction
[1:02:52] that we don't feel god
[1:02:54] it's usually in our affliction amen that
[1:02:57] it seems like god is far away
[1:02:59] it's usually in our afflictions amen
[1:03:02] when satan amen takes advantage and
[1:03:04] starts whispering in our ear
[1:03:09] god's forsaken you god ain't going to
[1:03:11] heal you your prayer ain't getting
[1:03:13] through amen and he'll whisper them
[1:03:15] things that god says i will hear and
[1:03:19] help
[1:03:20] in your affliction
[1:03:28] now notice
[1:03:30] jehoshaphat is not talking to god as a
[1:03:32] stranger
[1:03:36] he's not talking to god
[1:03:38] as maybe an egyptian
[1:03:40] or as a babylonian wood
[1:03:43] or whatever he's talking to god as a
[1:03:46] seed of abraham
[1:03:47] and he's reminding god
[1:03:49] i'm part of this promise
[1:03:52] every promise you made i'm part of
[1:03:54] are you with me now
[1:03:56] every promise you made
[1:03:58] i'm a part of that abraham seed i am
[1:04:01] part of that covenant you drove out the
[1:04:03] uh uh the enemy away from israel amen
[1:04:06] and then you brought him out of that
[1:04:08] land of slavery now i am here as part of
[1:04:12] that seed
[1:04:13] if you've done it for them you'll do it
[1:04:15] for me
[1:04:18] it was a personal god to him
[1:04:30] he's talking to god
[1:04:33] knowing
[1:04:34] that he is part of the promise that god
[1:04:36] gave
[1:04:40] i think that's important
[1:04:43] to approach god
[1:04:45] not as a stranger
[1:04:47] not wandering
[1:04:49] not with question marks
[1:04:52] on top of her head but coming to god
[1:04:55] with an assurance
[1:04:57] every promise you made i'm part of
[1:05:02] can you say amen
[1:05:03] i may not feel like it
[1:05:05] i i i may not amen feeling you
[1:05:08] everywhere but i know this one thing i'm
[1:05:10] part of the covenant
[1:05:11] [Applause]
[1:05:13] and i'm here to remind you god of who i
[1:05:15] am
[1:05:19] you hear your pastor you hear brother
[1:05:20] andrew and the ministers tell you who
[1:05:22] you are
[1:05:23] but now it's time sometimes you got to
[1:05:25] tell god who you are
[1:05:27] it's got to come from your own lips
[1:05:29] i am a son of god
[1:05:31] you say well that's a little arrogant no
[1:05:33] it isn't you're telling the devil i'm a
[1:05:35] child of god i'm a daughter of god i'm a
[1:05:38] son of god god loves to hear confidence
[1:05:41] coming out of his people it's an act of
[1:05:43] faith
[1:05:47] can you say amen
[1:05:48] paul even said the word of faith which
[1:05:51] we preach is even nicely even in thy
[1:05:54] mouth
[1:05:54] [Applause]
[1:05:59] ain't that right
[1:06:01] so so jehoshaphat had faith
[1:06:05] not in just that god was able
[1:06:07] not that just god could do it
[1:06:10] but he had faith in who he was
[1:06:13] and as he's reminding god of what he
[1:06:16] done to israel
[1:06:17] he's literally minding god of who he is
[1:06:21] as a seed of israel
[1:06:26] you see
[1:06:28] for the enemy
[1:06:30] to destroy israel and jehoshaphat
[1:06:34] would be for god to fail
[1:06:38] are you with me
[1:06:40] because it wasn't
[1:06:42] jehoshaphat wasn't pointing it now there
[1:06:44] there your seed over here but god look
[1:06:46] at me i hope i am
[1:06:48] he was putting it personally
[1:06:52] can you say amen
[1:06:54] see so so jehoshaphat
[1:06:56] is reminding god
[1:06:59] why they're a nation in the first place
[1:07:02] god
[1:07:04] we would have been in egypt but you
[1:07:05] brought us out
[1:07:08] god
[1:07:10] we're a mighty people
[1:07:12] but it's because of you
[1:07:14] you've sustained us all the way through
[1:07:17] generation after generation amen now you
[1:07:20] can just read between the lines of
[1:07:21] really what he's saying to god
[1:07:23] because look if god would keep his word
[1:07:26] throughout the ages then that enemy
[1:07:28] didn't matter to them because god would
[1:07:31] still keep it
[1:07:33] [Applause]
[1:07:37] young people god's kept your
[1:07:39] your elders
[1:07:41] why can't god keep you
[1:07:42] [Applause]
[1:07:45] it's not about natural lineage
[1:07:48] it's about predestination
[1:07:50] it's about a seed of god living inside
[1:07:53] of you can you say amen
[1:07:55] and if god
[1:07:56] if god fought my daddy's battles and my
[1:07:59] mama's battles god will fight my battles
[1:08:01] and if god will fight my battles he'll
[1:08:04] fight my children's battles he'll fight
[1:08:06] your battles
[1:08:07] he's a god that keeps his word
[1:08:15] he's a god that'll keep his word
[1:08:17] you don't have to be a preacher you
[1:08:19] don't have to be anything mighty you
[1:08:21] just have to be a seed of abraham
[1:08:29] just a seed
[1:08:31] and right in the middle of all the
[1:08:33] frustration
[1:08:34] god spoke
[1:08:36] to a prophet
[1:08:38] standing near
[1:08:41] that's what the prophet said he was a
[1:08:42] prophet
[1:08:43] the word of the lord comes to prophets
[1:08:44] right
[1:08:46] and the lord began to speak to them
[1:08:47] you'll not need to fight this battle
[1:08:50] set yourselves stand still
[1:08:53] and see the salvation of the lord
[1:08:55] in other words stand still
[1:08:58] keep calm
[1:08:59] keep your spirit calm
[1:09:02] can you say man
[1:09:03] don't allow yourself get frustrated
[1:09:06] don't allow yourself get tore up
[1:09:08] you say well you don't understand oh yes
[1:09:10] i do understand that god keeps his word
[1:09:14] [Applause]
[1:09:20] god did nothing to the enemy at that
[1:09:22] point
[1:09:23] the enemy's still approaching
[1:09:25] the enemy's looming on them
[1:09:27] and yet god says stand still
[1:09:30] stand still
[1:09:31] he used a prophet to tell them
[1:09:34] and israel always believed their prophet
[1:09:37] amen for a prophet in the midst of them
[1:09:39] knew it was a sign to them that god
[1:09:41] would speak
[1:09:42] and when that man spoke they knew god's
[1:09:44] one is speaking
[1:09:46] stand still
[1:09:47] and see the salvation of the lord can
[1:09:49] you say amen
[1:09:51] see the prophet said god was going to
[1:09:53] show his glory to them
[1:09:56] but he had to give them to stand still
[1:10:00] first
[1:10:02] watch the order of god stand still
[1:10:07] and see the salvation of the lord
[1:10:10] can you say amen
[1:10:12] see they were panicking
[1:10:14] because they were afraid they were tore
[1:10:16] up
[1:10:17] because they didn't have answers
[1:10:22] have you ever just been in a place you
[1:10:23] don't have answers
[1:10:26] and you're seeking for answers
[1:10:28] and troubles everywhere and you've got
[1:10:29] to find the answer you're going to die
[1:10:35] they were there
[1:10:36] and god said stand still
[1:10:42] i don't care what you got to do just
[1:10:44] stand still
[1:10:45] if you got to turn your back to the
[1:10:46] enemy just stand still
[1:10:51] if you if you can't stand still while
[1:10:52] the enemy's approaching look somewhere
[1:10:54] else
[1:10:56] but just stand still god had to get them
[1:10:59] to stand still in order to show them his
[1:11:03] power
[1:11:04] [Applause]
[1:11:09] the spirit of fear and anxiety was taken
[1:11:11] advantage
[1:11:13] and was getting on the people
[1:11:16] parents didn't know what to tell their
[1:11:17] children
[1:11:19] preachers didn't know what to tell their
[1:11:20] children the church
[1:11:22] everybody was at a at a place of
[1:11:24] confusion what are we going to do
[1:11:27] but then the voice came stand still
[1:11:30] see god couldn't show them his glory and
[1:11:32] power to them as long as they were in
[1:11:34] that state of mind now the prophet of
[1:11:36] god likens that age to this age
[1:11:39] we're in a neurotic age
[1:11:42] people running to and fro

[1:12:02] lid of hell has been lifted
[1:12:05] demon power is here like never before
[1:12:08] the prophet even preached invasion of
[1:12:10] the united states we're here in this
[1:12:13] invasion
[1:12:17] people are leaving the message like
[1:12:18] crazy

[1:12:41] to solve the problem they're in a panic
[1:12:43] there's so much chaos and such unrest
[1:12:46] that notice in the middle of the chaos

[1:19:12] do you know it's up to him to take care
[1:19:14] of it

[1:20:05] sean it's getting bad
[1:20:07] oh good well
[1:20:08] i can't help you on that when all i can
[1:20:09] say is stand still
[1:20:11] [Music]
[1:20:13] and that ain't me that's him
[1:20:15] that's god himself telling you stand
[1:20:17] still i know it it would be nice if he'd
[1:20:19] give you the formula and tell you what
[1:20:21] day it's going to end and that you ain't
[1:20:23] going to have to go through these
[1:20:24] battles but all he says is stand still
[1:20:27] i don't care what matter you're going
[1:20:28] through the same the same answer we all
[1:20:31] have that same answer stand still
[1:20:34] stand still
[1:20:35] stand
[1:20:44] still he made the promise
[1:20:48] that he'd never forget us
[1:20:52] isaiah 49 15
[1:20:54] can a woman forget her suckling child
[1:20:57] that she should not have compassion
[1:21:00] on the son of her womb
[1:21:02] yay
[1:21:04] they may forget now
[1:21:06] you think of that
[1:21:08] because we hear brother brown talking
[1:21:10] about that
[1:21:11] baby
[1:21:12] that was in that burning home
[1:21:14] and that mother
[1:21:15] took off running after
[1:21:17] she was a beautiful woman
[1:21:19] but she didn't care about her beauty at
[1:21:20] that time
[1:21:22] she worried about that baby
[1:21:25] she couldn't forget about that baby
[1:21:27] she couldn't let the the the hot gluten
[1:21:29] wasn't hot and the fire wasn't hot
[1:21:31] enough to allow her to forget about that
[1:21:33] baby she would be willing to go through
[1:21:35] them flames and be scarred the rest of
[1:21:37] her life for that little baby
[1:21:39] and if god if a natural woman would be
[1:21:42] that way what about god concerning you
[1:21:48] for he said they may forget yet i will
[1:21:50] not
[1:21:53] i will not forget thee
[1:21:56] behold
[1:21:58] i have the graven upon the palms of my
[1:22:00] hands
[1:22:02] and thy walls
[1:22:04] are continually
[1:22:06] everybody say continually
[1:22:08] continually before me
[1:22:10] now you think of that
[1:22:12] not that you have him continually before
[1:22:14] you
[1:22:16] you are continually before him
[1:22:20] so everywhere he looks you're right
[1:22:21] there
[1:22:22] he can look this way you're there
[1:22:24] he can look that way you're there he can
[1:22:26] look this way you're there when he looks
[1:22:28] down you're there when he looks up
[1:22:30] you're there you're continually before
[1:22:33] him
[1:22:38] there ain't no smoke in your trial
[1:22:41] can block you out
[1:22:42] you're continually before him
[1:22:45] there ain't no scars of your past can
[1:22:47] disfigure you before him he's knows what
[1:22:50] he called you and that's what he sees
[1:22:52] constantly before him
[1:22:55] he ain't looking at your imperfection
[1:22:56] he's not looking at your weakness he's
[1:22:58] not looking at your inability what he
[1:23:01] called you to be is what's continually
[1:23:05] before him
[1:23:06] before him and when we forgive he will
[1:23:10] never forget because you're continually
[1:23:12] before him
[1:23:24] stand still
[1:23:27] how do we stand still by standing on the
[1:23:30] promise
[1:23:31] stand
[1:23:32] still keep the promise before you
[1:23:38] you with me
[1:23:40] stand still
[1:23:44] see your enemy
[1:23:46] is god's enemy
[1:23:48] don't you think
[1:23:50] that he's left your enemy
[1:23:52] and you to fight him all alone
[1:23:54] no no no no no no
[1:23:56] he's fighting with you
[1:24:00] stand still
[1:24:01] can you say amen
[1:24:04] sometimes it seems as if god might have
[1:24:06] joined up with our enemy
[1:24:09] it seemed like everything's going wrong
[1:24:10] and we're not finding the answers
[1:24:14] but don't you let the devil lie to you
[1:24:16] [Applause]
[1:24:18] the devil is the only one that's accuser
[1:24:20] of the brethren
[1:24:22] do you believe that
[1:24:24] the devil is the accuser of the brethren
[1:24:27] not god
[1:24:29] if god wanted to accuse you he would
[1:24:31] have done that before the foundation of
[1:24:33] the world
[1:24:34] but instead of accusing you he had a
[1:24:37] landslide
[1:24:39] before the foundation of the world
[1:24:42] that he could look at the blood and not
[1:24:44] you
[1:24:45] [Music]
[1:24:47] now that's what the prophet says he says
[1:24:48] he don't see me he sees the blood
[1:24:52] but he hears my voice
[1:24:54] [Applause]
[1:24:58] ain't that right
[1:25:00] now notice jeremiah 29 11
[1:25:02] for i know the thoughts
[1:25:04] that i think towards you
[1:25:06] said the lord thoughts of peace and not
[1:25:09] of evil to give you an expected end
[1:25:17] now jehoshaphat in in in looking at
[1:25:20] these things
[1:25:21] i believe that he remembered it was god
[1:25:24] that brought his people out of egypt
[1:25:28] it was him that he remembered it was god
[1:25:31] that delivered them from slavery
[1:25:34] he remembered that god brought the water
[1:25:38] from a
[1:25:38] rock
[1:25:40] when they were about to die of thirst
[1:25:44] can you say man
[1:25:46] he remembered how that god anointed
[1:25:50] that little stone
[1:25:53] that's david looking at that glass
[1:25:56] and by all rights he should die
[1:25:58] but he was a child of promise
[1:26:02] and as that slaughter
[1:26:04] that sling released that stone the
[1:26:06] spirit of the lord rode on that stone
[1:26:11] and it become a super dynamic stone
[1:26:14] that it even broke the sound barrier
[1:26:22] stand still
[1:26:27] throughout the bible god would speak
[1:26:29] through the prophets
[1:26:31] to let the peoples know that his heart
[1:26:33] and attitude has never changed toward
[1:26:35] them and i hope this is all right to
[1:26:36] read but isaiah 43 1
[1:26:39] but now thus saith the lord that created
[1:26:41] thee o jacob
[1:26:43] and he that formed thee o israel
[1:26:45] fear not for i have redeemed thee
[1:26:48] i have called thee by thy name thou art
[1:26:50] mine
[1:26:52] aren't you glad he possessed you
[1:26:54] he's got you as his possession
[1:26:56] you are his
[1:26:58] thou art mine when thou passes through
[1:27:00] the waters i will be with thee
[1:27:03] he didn't say you're going to feel me he
[1:27:04] said i will be with you
[1:27:06] can you say amen
[1:27:08] that's right see and through the rivers
[1:27:10] they shall not overflow thee and when
[1:27:13] thou walketh through the fire thou shall
[1:27:15] not be burned neither shall the flame
[1:27:18] kindle upon thee for i am the lord thy
[1:27:20] god the holy one of israel thy savior i
[1:27:23] gave the egypt for thy ransom and
[1:27:26] ethiopia and siba for thee since thou
[1:27:29] was precious in my sight thou has been
[1:27:32] honorable i have loved thee therefore
[1:27:34] will i give men for thee and people for
[1:27:37] thy life fear not for i am with thee
[1:27:47] years later god would speak to the
[1:27:49] prophet malachi and say for i am the
[1:27:51] lord
[1:27:52] i change not
[1:27:55] therefore you sons of jacob are not
[1:27:57] consumed
[1:28:00] pretty bold and that's very just pretty
[1:28:01] blunt
[1:28:03] you're not consumed
[1:28:05] because i am the lord
[1:28:07] and i change not
[1:28:10] [Applause]
[1:28:11] if god was with you in the first day of
[1:28:13] your of your christian life he's still
[1:28:15] with you
[1:28:17] if god saved you and he found it
[1:28:19] pleasing to fill you with the holy ghost
[1:28:21] don't you ever think that he's left you
[1:28:23] he's walking right with you he's with
[1:28:25] you in the valley when you ain't feeling
[1:28:28] him he's with you
[1:28:31] and the blood is speaking
[1:28:34] for you
[1:28:40] psalms 145 19 he will fulfill the desire
[1:28:43] of them that fear him
[1:28:45] you see why you need to stand still
[1:28:49] he will fulfill
[1:28:51] the desire of them that fear him
[1:28:55] he also will hear their cry and will
[1:28:57] save them the lord preserveth all them
[1:29:00] that love him that all the wicked will
[1:29:03] he destroy see he cannot change
[1:29:07] do you love
[1:29:08] him in he wonderful
[1:29:12] so the question is are you his righteous
[1:29:14] seed
[1:29:17] who made you his righteous seed
[1:29:20] god did
[1:29:22] didn't that basic god did
[1:29:24] it wasn't my desire to be it give us
[1:29:26] god's desire
[1:29:29] you you might be desire oh i want to
[1:29:31] serve god i want to serve god i want to
[1:29:32] serve god and your desire is right
[1:29:35] but think of the desire that he has that
[1:29:39] is magnified thousands of times
[1:29:42] than your desire
[1:29:46] he desires to have a walk with you
[1:29:52] he so desired to fill you with the holy
[1:29:55] ghost that he made a way so he could do
[1:29:57] it
[1:30:00] and you say amen
[1:30:01] i believe he so desired for you to go on
[1:30:03] the rapture that he would send a prophet
[1:30:04] to get you ready
[1:30:05] [Applause]
[1:30:08] it's grace
[1:30:09] do you realize it's grace it's the
[1:30:11] desire on god's part we weren't crying
[1:30:14] for a prophet
[1:30:17] we weren't saying god sent us a prophet
[1:30:19] but way before this age he wrote it in
[1:30:22] the bible behold i sent unto you elijah
[1:30:25] the prophet it was from his desire
[1:30:31] [Music]
[1:30:33] his desire
[1:30:35] can you say amen
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:30:39] now the prophet said see it was god's
[1:30:41] battle as long as they were together and
[1:30:43] praying
[1:30:45] don't
[1:30:47] make it
[1:30:48] your battle
[1:30:55] you with me
[1:30:56] you say oh but that was them no no no no
[1:30:59] the prophet said this is like an our day
[1:31:02] there's the enemy that's invading and
[1:31:04] there's a people that's the seed of god
[1:31:09] now not everybody has these same words
[1:31:11] that you're hearing
[1:31:13] not everybody knows what to do
[1:31:15] but god has told you stand still
[1:31:19] and he's giving you every reason why to
[1:31:21] stand still you're a child of promise
[1:31:24] you're predestinated you've got a
[1:31:26] destiny
[1:31:27] [Applause]
[1:31:32] you believe that
[1:31:35] i don't take long so
[1:31:37] i hope i'm not keeping you
[1:31:39] too long i promised i wasn't a two-hour
[1:31:41] preacher today so
[1:31:43] i'll try to hurry
[1:31:46] but you realize and i know you do
[1:31:49] that not every scripture in this bible
[1:31:52] pertains to us
[1:31:57] and a lot of times
[1:32:01] ministers especially when they get into
[1:32:02] a legalist idea my frame of mind
[1:32:06] they'll take scriptures
[1:32:08] to use it to be the bride up
[1:32:11] when it don't belong to bride
[1:32:18] can you say amen
[1:32:20] don't be worried i'm not off
[1:32:24] but i can tell you this the prophet said
[1:32:26] a christian will never blaspheme god
[1:32:37] so when it speaks of blasphemy that
[1:32:39] ain't to a bride
[1:32:41] so don't let the devil put that on you
[1:32:43] say well i've just i've crossed the line
[1:32:45] a believer can never cross the line
[1:32:47] [Applause]
[1:32:50] you say oh you're putting it out there
[1:32:51] where everybody can do what they what
[1:32:52] they can do no i'm just telling you
[1:32:54] stand still
[1:32:56] and see the salvation of the lord
[1:32:59] don't let the devil tear you up with
[1:33:01] scriptures that don't belong to you
[1:33:03] [Applause]
[1:33:15] there are scriptures that pertain to the
[1:33:16] ungodly
[1:33:18] they're scriptures that pertain to the
[1:33:19] foolish virgin
[1:33:21] [Applause]
[1:33:22] can you say amen
[1:33:24] there are scriptures that pertain to
[1:33:25] people that's going to be at the white
[1:33:26] throne judgment
[1:33:28] but i'll never stand at the white throne
[1:33:29] judgment i'm a bride of christ
[1:33:32] you say well how do you know because i
[1:33:34] know in my heart so therefore when i
[1:33:37] pray to god i don't pray to god as a
[1:33:39] foolish virgin i pray to god as a son of
[1:33:42] god
[1:33:43] [Applause]
[1:33:45] can you say amen
[1:33:48] therefore i can remind god of the
[1:33:50] promises that belong to me
[1:33:52] [Applause]
[1:33:58] you with me
[1:34:00] how can i stand still
[1:34:02] if i'm afraid i'm going to go in the
[1:34:03] tribulation
[1:34:08] that's why the people the world's
[1:34:10] nervous
[1:34:11] the wrath of god is coming up on this
[1:34:13] earth
[1:34:14] they don't know what to do about it
[1:34:16] they're trying to laugh their way out of
[1:34:18] it
[1:34:19] they're trying to move either way out of
[1:34:21] it
[1:34:22] they're trying to entertain their way
[1:34:23] out of it
[1:34:27] and they're restless they're trying to
[1:34:29] find every which way to avoid the wrath
[1:34:31] of god that's coming
[1:34:34] but when i go to god
[1:34:37] i know that scripture doesn't pertain
[1:34:40] i i hope you know where you're at
[1:34:43] [Applause]
[1:34:44] because i believe this bride is going to
[1:34:46] know who she is
[1:34:48] and when she knows who she is she'll be
[1:34:50] an invincible army
[1:34:55] [Music]
[1:35:03] could you imagine the son of god going
[1:35:05] to god in prayer
[1:35:07] not knowing who he is
[1:35:09] we've had that through years
[1:35:11] but that's why god would send the
[1:35:13] message
[1:35:15] that we could identify ourselves in the
[1:35:17] book
[1:35:19] brother brown said you can find your
[1:35:20] character in the bible
[1:35:23] remember ron i've i've searched my
[1:35:25] character
[1:35:26] i don't fit ahab
[1:35:31] can you say amen
[1:35:35] i see there's a bright character
[1:35:43] i believe paul knew who he was
[1:35:46] i believe the prophet knew who he was
[1:35:49] did not the angel tell show brother
[1:35:50] branham who he was brother branham knew
[1:35:53] he come to the understanding he was
[1:35:55] malachi 4.
[1:35:58] did he not
[1:36:01] he come to the understanding that he was
[1:36:03] that seventh
[1:36:08] angel if god could show him why can't
[1:36:11] god show us
[1:36:13] that we're the bride of christ
[1:36:15] how many is the bride of christ
[1:36:17] not because your pastor told yet not
[1:36:19] because i tell you not because even the
[1:36:21] prophet tells you it's because god has
[1:36:23] showed you by divine revelation
[1:36:26] [Applause]
[1:36:29] then the book becomes an open book
[1:36:32] it becomes a new book it becomes a
[1:36:33] personal book
[1:36:35] can you say amen
[1:36:36] john knew who he was
[1:36:39] the bible said i mean the prophet said
[1:36:40] when the book was opened john saw his
[1:36:42] name
[1:36:44] and i don't believe that john just saw
[1:36:45] his name on one page i believe every
[1:36:48] promise that pertained to the bride of
[1:36:50] christ john saw his little name right
[1:36:52] there
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:37:00] stand still
[1:37:03] and see the salvation of the lord
[1:37:07] you love him
[1:37:09] stand still
[1:37:11] now i'm going close
[1:37:14] but the prophet said
[1:37:16] god made the red sea stand still
[1:37:18] bird's children
[1:37:21] because he wanted to show his glory
[1:37:26] when jesus stood at the grave of lazarus
[1:37:31] think of it
[1:37:33] death had taken over
[1:37:35] and corruption began to set in
[1:37:37] because he had been in there four days
[1:37:39] maybe the sockets eye sockets
[1:37:42] her eyes were already decayed
[1:37:44] maybe parts of the flesh was already the
[1:37:47] skin worms had already devoured a lot
[1:37:50] but god made death stand still
[1:37:54] to show forth his power
[1:37:58] and when jesus said lazarus come forth
[1:38:00] it wasn't just what remained of lazarus
[1:38:02] that came forth
[1:38:04] death had to give everything back
[1:38:06] [Applause]
[1:38:10] i don't know if he made the skin worms
[1:38:11] burp it back up i don't know but all i
[1:38:13] know is when lazarus came forth there
[1:38:15] was a restored lazarus
[1:38:19] because death had to stand still
[1:38:23] to see god's
[1:38:28] glory he'll make arthritis stand still
[1:38:32] he'll make cancer stand still
[1:38:34] he'll make tuberculosis stand still to
[1:38:37] see his glory
[1:38:40] i say to you god is with this church god
[1:38:43] is with this bride
[1:38:48] well give him glory church

[1:38:58] lord
[1:39:08] you see what god is doing to this bride
[1:39:10] he's making the devil stand still
[1:39:14] he's making that drunk spirit stand
[1:39:15] still

[1:39:44] about the army and began to worship the
[1:39:46] lord the word of the lord was good

[1:53:15] so we have the church to pray and as we
[1:53:17] begin to pray
