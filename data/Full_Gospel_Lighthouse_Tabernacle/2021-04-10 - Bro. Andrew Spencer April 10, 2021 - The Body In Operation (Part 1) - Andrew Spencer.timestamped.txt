[39:00] mark and brother matthew and
[39:02] so thankful for them for stepping in and
[39:05] just
[39:05] falling right into the position that god
[39:08] called them to be and
[39:09] certainly thankful and i know you
[39:11] enjoyed it i know you enjoyed brother
[39:12] mark
[39:13] just the inspiration of life there he's
[39:15] just
[39:16] he's born in the fire and we certainly
[39:19] enjoyed ourselves and
[39:21] and louisiana there at the eastern
[39:23] meetings of brother tim pruitt's and
[39:25] we bring greetings back from all of them
[39:27] there and
[39:28] seeing such a mighty move of god there
[39:30] and i'm sure
[39:31] 90 of you maybe 100 percent of you have
[39:34] been able to take in those services or
[39:36] were a part of those services at that
[39:38] time and i know that if you've watched
[39:40] them they were a real blessing to
[39:42] you and i just say that it was a real
[39:45] honor to
[39:46] be there and be in those meetings to be
[39:48] a brother danny brother tim and just see
[39:50] to see the things that we've seen and
[39:52] then to see our pastor
[39:54] speak with such passion and the
[39:56] anointing of the lord just moving him
[39:59] i i know that there were some people
[40:01] that were watching me
[40:02] because i was watching him and uh
[40:06] i'd be honest i had not seen my dad or
[40:09] my
[40:09] or our pastor move in such a way and
[40:12] preach
[40:12] under that such such passion like that
[40:15] and over
[40:16] in quite some time and and uh it was
[40:19] i was just blown away by it all still
[40:21] blown away and i believe i'm carrying
[40:23] effects of that
[40:24] even even tonight and i believe there'll
[40:26] be effects
[40:27] of that meeting throughout eternity that
[40:29] will tell of and
[40:31] i just have to say that we're we're
[40:33] packing we're packing a revival
[40:36] it's not nuts that nothing that we
[40:37] carried back home in our
[40:39] in our briefcase but it's something that
[40:41] we're packing in our heart
[40:43] and we're just so stirred and so
[40:45] thankful for the
[40:46] the the holy ghost how he's doing things
[40:49] in our life and
[40:50] and i'm just asking that we'd have that
[40:53] same type of meeting
[40:54] right here why shouldn't we have those
[40:56] type of meetings
[40:58] you know to be honest i feel like we're
[41:00] we're just blessed beyond measure we
[41:02] have these type of meetings every
[41:04] weekend

[41:08] the inspiration
[41:10] of the of the meeting and just to see
[41:12] what god's doing for his people and
[41:15] we're a blessed people we're a blessed
[41:17] people and i believe that the angel is
[41:19] here
[41:20] he's here to carry us not just through
[41:22] laodicea but to carry us all the way
[41:24] into the rapture
[41:25] amen amen let's let's just go to the
[41:29] word this evening
[41:30] if you have your bibles we'd like uh
[41:32] like to look over in the book of first
[41:34] corinthians chapter 12.
[41:38] first corinthians chapter 12 and verse
[41:40] 12
[41:46] amen
[41:52] amen
[41:58] our hearts are stirred saints and we're
[42:00] just just looking for the coming of the
[42:03] lord
[42:04] amen amen
[42:07] first corinthians chapter 12 and verse
[42:09] 12
[42:11] the bible says here for as the body is
[42:14] one and half
[42:15] many members and all the members of that
[42:17] one body
[42:19] being many are one body so also
[42:22] is christ for by one spirit
[42:25] are we all baptized into one body
[42:28] whether we be jews or gentiles whether
[42:30] we be bond or free
[42:32] and having been all made to drink into
[42:35] one spirit
[42:37] for the body is not one member but many
[42:40] if the foot shall say because i am not
[42:42] the hand i
[42:44] i am not of the body is it therefore not
[42:46] of the body
[42:47] if the ear shall say because i am not
[42:49] the eye i
[42:50] am not of the body is it therefore not
[42:53] of the body
[42:54] if the whole body were an eye where were
[42:56] the hearing if
[42:58] the whole were hearing where were the
[43:00] smelling
[43:01] but now hath god set the members
[43:04] every one of them in the body as it hath
[43:07] pleased him
[43:09] and if they were all one member where
[43:12] were the body
[43:13] but now are they many members
[43:17] yet but one body amen let's speak to the
[43:21] author of the word this evening

[43:40] you and to hear from you

[43:48] congregation one more time

[43:52] asking god that
[43:53] you would just take us into the realm
[43:56] father of the believer
[43:57] may we just lay aside every weight in
[44:00] sin that does so easily beset us lord
[44:02] lord may we just get in one mind get in
[44:05] one accord
[44:06] lord get into a place where the spirit
[44:08] of the living god can speak to us oh god
[44:11] we're asking lord that you would heal
[44:13] those that are
[44:14] that are afflicted that you would
[44:16] deliver those that are bound father
[44:18] lord i pray that you'd set the captive
[44:20] free father may you bring a
[44:23] an edification to the body tonight lord
[44:26] move us where you need us to be father
[44:28] for your glory sake
[44:30] now father we ask that you take control
[44:32] of the service
[44:33] for your glory in the name of jesus
[44:35] christ and the body of christ says
[44:38] amen may god bless you you may be seated
[44:41] in the presence of the lord we
[44:42] would like to speak to you this evening
[44:45] and we don't know exactly how this
[44:47] this service will go or if it'll
[44:48] transition over into another
[44:50] another service but we'd like to speak
[44:52] to you this evening on the body
[44:54] the body in operation the body and
[44:57] operation and we know that
[44:59] that god and we're very acquainted that
[45:01] god is
[45:02] god is working through the body and
[45:04] working through
[45:05] gifts of the spirit where god is coming
[45:07] down
[45:08] afresh and pouring out his spirit into
[45:10] the body
[45:12] and when we know that when christ was
[45:14] here that he told us
[45:16] that he would send us a comforter that
[45:18] he would send to god
[45:19] that would he would be that god that
[45:21] would guide us into all truth and that
[45:24] he would be there with us
[45:26] no matter where we would go he told us
[45:27] that that i'll not leave you and i'll
[45:29] not forsake you but he would be the god
[45:32] that would guide us into all things that
[45:34] would guide us into
[45:36] all truth and i'm so thankful to know
[45:38] that the god tonight is
[45:40] is the same lord jesus he's still here
[45:43] and he's still directing his people
[45:45] and moving them into the place of
[45:48] maturity into the place of truth
[45:50] into the doctrinal into the doctrine of
[45:53] the gospel of jesus christ
[45:55] and the god that you and i have here
[45:58] tonight was paul's god
[46:00] he was the same god as he was with peter
[46:03] and when you see peter on the
[46:04] peter on the scene you begin to see paul
[46:06] come on the scene
[46:07] but there was no conflict in their
[46:09] gospel but the same god that was guiding
[46:12] peter was the same
[46:14] god that was guiding paul that was
[46:16] speaking through them
[46:17] and yet they not had not a convention
[46:19] where they would come down and speak
[46:21] over
[46:21] things but the god was leading them into
[46:24] the same
[46:25] doctrinal truths that would bring them
[46:27] and bring edification to the body
[46:30] and that same god was william branham's
[46:32] god
[46:33] and you could see that the same
[46:35] anointing that was on paul you could see
[46:38] that same
[46:38] holy spirit that was guiding the
[46:40] messenger of this age
[46:42] when others when others tried to pull
[46:44] him and they tried to
[46:46] persecute him or tried to persuade him
[46:49] in different ways
[46:50] he would only stay where the god said
[46:53] stay
[46:53] they tried to pull him off of his
[46:55] doctrines and tried to pull him off of
[46:57] this and
[46:58] and give us gifts give us these things
[47:00] and if you just let
[47:02] down on on women preachers if you just
[47:04] let down on water baptism if you just
[47:06] let down on these certain doctrinal
[47:08] truths then you can come into our fold
[47:11] and you'll be used in our fold like
[47:13] never before but i'm so thankful that
[47:15] we're standing under a messenger
[47:17] that did not bend and was not persuaded
[47:20] by
[47:21] men of theology and men that were of
[47:23] great stature
[47:24] of their ideologies of what the bible
[47:26] had said
[47:27] but there was a god that was guiding our
[47:30] messenger
[47:30] that would not allow him to to waver in
[47:34] one way
[47:34] nor even go off the scene in his own
[47:37] humanity
[47:38] but he would guide him he would guide
[47:41] him and
[47:42] and i i love this quote that brother
[47:44] branham said now he said
[47:45] now he runs his own business
[47:48] now we we understand that that that we
[47:51] are equated with a supernatural ministry
[47:54] like never before like the world has
[47:55] never seen and i believe
[47:57] tonight that we could say that we are
[47:59] blessed beyond measure
[48:00] to be a part of this supernatural
[48:02] message be a part of these things that
[48:05] that didn't die in 1965 but are still in
[48:08] the body
[48:09] still moving in the body they're still
[48:11] gifts there's still
[48:12] power in the body they're still
[48:14] anointing of the mighty angel that's in
[48:16] the body
[48:17] but we're acquainted that that that
[48:19] guard used a messenger by the name of
[48:22] william branham
[48:23] and we'd watch how that god would use
[48:25] him and brother branham said that he
[48:27] runs his own business he said now i
[48:30] don't tell him
[48:31] he tells me i don't operate him he
[48:34] operates
[48:35] me but it's a gift that you just yield
[48:38] yourself to
[48:39] he said look at this microphone you're
[48:40] hearing my voice
[48:42] but that microphone is a dumb mute until
[48:44] something
[48:45] operates it is that right it can't speak
[48:48] itself
[48:48] the music we hear it's a mute unless
[48:51] something
[48:52] unless something makes it unless
[48:55] something is making it it's a mute
[48:57] so we know that that that we are
[49:00] standing here
[49:01] and if we are the mighty of jesus christ
[49:04] that we can only move
[49:06] as the headship of christ operates the
[49:09] body
[49:10] but only the elect of god the
[49:12] predetermined
[49:13] before the foundation of the world are
[49:16] walking
[49:16] and in a capacity to be able to move
[49:20] under the operation of the full
[49:22] authority of jesus christ
[49:24] notice what the bible said in
[49:26] revelations that the spirit and the
[49:29] bride are
[49:30] saying the same thing they're saying
[49:32] come
[49:33] they're not wavering on one another if
[49:35] you're standing up and you're not
[49:37] saying what the spirit says you're not
[49:40] preaching
[49:40] what paul but preached bible said that
[49:44] they say
[49:45] the same thing that even jesus himself
[49:48] said
[49:49] he said for it's not ye that speak but
[49:52] it's the father or the spirit of the
[49:54] father
[49:55] that speaks within you so it's not the
[49:58] humanity
[50:00] but it's the divinity of god that it's
[50:02] expressing himself
[50:04] through humanity you go to thinking
[50:07] about humanity and you go to thinking
[50:09] about the messenger of the day
[50:11] how could a seventh grade educated
[50:13] kentucky hillbilly
[50:15] come out of those hills packing a
[50:17] message like he had
[50:19] and had such spiritual understanding
[50:22] able to break into a realm
[50:24] and being being able to ponder their
[50:27] minds of theologies
[50:29] ponder the minds of of great
[50:31] intellectual speakers of the day
[50:33] to ponder their minds and think where
[50:35] did this heal
[50:36] billy get this understanding
[50:39] he's not went to no school he's not went
[50:42] to no theologies
[50:43] where did he get it from but you know
[50:45] that brother branham would say
[50:47] it was the angel that told me that it
[50:50] was the angel that told me that
[50:52] when you see him moving in that power
[50:55] you know when william branham come out
[50:58] of that cave
[50:59] back in that commission it was more than
[51:02] a man
[51:04] there was an angel that was moving you
[51:06] remember when brother branham you're
[51:08] acquainted when brother branham comes to
[51:09] preach the seals he said i took some
[51:11] history
[51:12] and i was going to bring some things
[51:14] that i preached before and some things
[51:16] that i had that i had looked over he
[51:18] said i was going to come to the pulpit
[51:20] with that
[51:21] he said but about 12 o'clock in the day
[51:23] he
[51:24] came into the room you see
[51:27] you see he was going to come with what
[51:30] he thought those seals were
[51:31] but god the angel so cared
[51:35] about you that he will not allow
[51:37] humanity
[51:38] to stand in front of divinity
[51:42] are you with me if he'd just come with
[51:44] what he thought of the books would still
[51:46] be sealed
[51:47] but we stand here in full authority
[51:50] as the body of jesus christ with an open
[51:53] book
[51:54] an unsealed book
[51:58] hallelujah i wasn't the one that
[52:02] appeared down there on the river
[52:04] i was only standing there when he
[52:05] appeared
[52:07] i'm not the one that performs these
[52:08] things and foretells these things that
[52:10] happens as perfect as they are
[52:12] i'm only the one i'm only one that's
[52:15] near when he does it
[52:17] i was only a voice and he used to say
[52:20] it wasn't what i knew it's what i
[52:23] surrendered
[52:24] myself to that he spoke through it isn't
[52:28] me
[52:28] it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was
[52:31] the manifestation
[52:33] of the son of man it wasn't the angel
[52:35] his message
[52:37] it was the mystery that god unfolded
[52:39] it's not a man
[52:40] it's god the angel was not the son of
[52:42] man
[52:43] he was the messenger from the son of man
[52:46] the son of man is christ
[52:48] he is the one that you're feeding on can
[52:50] he say amen
[52:52] can you say amen he's the one that
[52:54] you're feeding on
[52:55] you're not feeding on a man
[52:58] let's get a greek big hearty amen right
[53:00] there you're you're not feeding on a man
[53:03] his words will fail but you're feeding
[53:07] but you're feeding on the unfailing body
[53:10] word
[53:11] of the son of man that's where you're
[53:14] drawing your strength
[53:15] that's where you're drawing your power
[53:17] that's where you're drawing your
[53:18] anointing
[53:20] you're not feeding on my ministry you're
[53:22] not feeding on brother ron's ministry
[53:24] you're not feeding on the man william
[53:26] branham's ministry
[53:28] you're feeding on the unfailing body
[53:31] word
[53:32] it won't fail you but it'll produce you
[53:35] to be
[53:35] exactly what god ordained you to be
[53:40] see the spirit working in the flesh of
[53:42] the church
[53:43] just like it worked in the flesh of
[53:45] jesus
[53:46] because it's a part of the body
[53:51] notice over in colossians chapter 1
[53:54] verse 15.
[53:56] the bible says who is the image of the
[53:59] invisible god the firstborn of every
[54:00] creature
[54:01] for by him were all things created that
[54:04] are in heaven and that are in earth
[54:06] visible and invisible whether they be
[54:09] thrones dominions principalities powers
[54:12] all things were created by him and for
[54:15] him
[54:16] he is before all things
[54:20] seek ye first the kingdom of god he is
[54:23] before
[54:24] all things he was before time began
[54:27] he will be here when time ends he is
[54:31] before all things and if he can be
[54:33] before all things in your life
[54:35] all things will consist in your life all
[54:38] things will be held together
[54:39] if he is the head of your marriage the
[54:43] head of your house
[54:44] the head of your family the head of your
[54:46] heart
[54:48] you ain't got to worry if you're going
[54:49] to shake and crumble apart you're going
[54:51] to hold together
[54:53] because there's a power there's a power
[54:56] there
[54:56] that's bringing the body together
[55:01] it'll be so fiddly joined together it's
[55:03] tempered with grace
[55:04] it's tempered and put together by the
[55:07] holy ghost
[55:09] you think about how god is brought
[55:11] brother william here and brother
[55:13] nathanael here and
[55:14] these elements have helped in these
[55:16] elements of these elements of bueno
[55:18] vista these elements of madison
[55:20] what's god doing he's building a body
[55:25] he's building a body and he
[55:28] is the head of the body the church
[55:32] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[55:35] the dead
[55:35] that in all things he might have the
[55:38] preeminence
[55:40] now paul would say over in philippians
[55:42] chapter 2
[55:43] and verse 5 he would say let this mind
[55:47] being you which was also in
[55:50] christ jesus and if you go to looking
[55:54] at the old at your own human body and
[55:56] humanity
[55:58] you know that it be that the body
[56:01] gets its intellects from the brain
[56:04] it all functions that are done
[56:06] throughout the body
[56:08] there are they they are functioning by
[56:11] that headship
[56:14] i have seen some people that i'm pretty
[56:16] sure they're brainless
[56:18] but you watch their that the headship or
[56:21] the body
[56:22] is functioning by that brain
[56:25] by that that brain is telling you to
[56:27] breathe that brain is telling you to
[56:29] swallow
[56:30] that brain is is working digestion in
[56:33] your body
[56:33] it's working eye movement in the body
[56:35] it's working the heartbeat
[56:37] and etc down through the body so we know
[56:40] that if the body will move
[56:42] it has to be the headship or the
[56:45] intellect
[56:45] telling the body to move
[56:48] [Applause]
[56:49] so if the body starts speaking that you
[56:52] can overcome
[56:53] by the power of the word it's something
[56:55] telling you
[56:56] there's a headship that's saying you're
[56:58] more than a conqueror
[57:02] if the body starts preaching healing
[57:04] that there is healing for you
[57:06] that by his stripes you are healed it is
[57:09] telling you there's a headship
[57:10] that's saying there's healing for you if
[57:13] the body
[57:14] or the ministry starts preaching there's
[57:16] deliverance
[57:17] chains can be broke circumstances can be
[57:20] overcome
[57:21] you are seeing a body in operation
[57:25] by the headship of almighty god
[57:28] this body is being moved by none other
[57:32] than him notice the body's growing
[57:36] it's growing from the freak from the
[57:38] feet coming
[57:40] up it's coming up more as it comes up
[57:43] there's more important parts of the body
[57:45] from the feet on into the lungs on into
[57:47] the heart
[57:48] on into the head and who is the head
[57:54] who is the head that's the intelligence
[57:57] i'm reading your prophet
[57:58] how's the body move by the head amen and
[58:02] the government shall be
[58:03] upon his the body
[58:07] will move by the headship and the
[58:09] government shall be
[58:10] upon his shoulders
[58:14] what is his shoulders his body
[58:17] amen that's where the real true church
[58:20] speaks in his power that's where the
[58:22] apostolic power returns to the church
[58:25] when the government shall be upon his
[58:28] shoulders
[58:29] he said there's coming a real church
[58:34] you can see the prophet as he's looking
[58:37] out into that land
[58:38] there's coming a church there's coming a
[58:40] church she's coming
[58:42] and she the government shall rest upon
[58:44] the shoulders
[58:45] [Applause]
[58:47] he was looking into a realm and he was
[58:49] seeing a people
[58:50] that believed his message that one was
[58:53] one with this message
[58:55] she's here
[59:05] hallelujah it ain't your own knowledge
[59:10] it's so it isn't your own knowledge of
[59:12] what you've attained
[59:13] throughout the years your knowledge can
[59:16] be stripped from you
[59:19] your intellects can be taken from you
[59:21] but revelation
[59:23] cannot be stolen if all you've got is
[59:27] knowledge
[59:28] from somebody else somebody else can
[59:30] take it away
[59:31] if all you've got is intellect from some
[59:33] book somewhere
[59:34] it can be taken away but if god
[59:37] has so revealed himself that he's in the
[59:40] body
[59:41] he's moving in a body that can't be
[59:43] taken away
[59:48] it's over
[59:51] i like that no more wavering
[59:54] no more trying to figure which way is up
[59:56] or which way's there it's settled
[1:00:01] you know when you're just when you're
[1:00:02] first getting married you're trying to
[1:00:04] work out all the kinks
[1:00:07] am i is this pinch me is this real
[1:00:12] can i really be this far in love
[1:00:15] and all of a sudden you get so upset
[1:00:19] because she put the toothpaste where you
[1:00:21] didn't want her to
[1:00:25] you see you're working out the kinks
[1:00:27] you're kind of you're kind of settling
[1:00:28] in
[1:00:29] and you're now i'm gonna talk so i'm
[1:00:31] gonna talk something to you young people
[1:00:33] you understand
[1:00:34] after you get through it that major leap
[1:00:36] you get through them first six months
[1:00:40] you finally made it and then you go
[1:00:43] through the next six months
[1:00:44] but you're what you're doing is you're
[1:00:46] operating
[1:00:47] in a spot of marriage that you hadn't
[1:00:50] operated there before
[1:00:52] and you watch as a teamwork of the body
[1:00:54] is getting built
[1:00:55] between a unity that has come together
[1:00:59] and you watch when those two that have
[1:01:01] become one
[1:01:02] you can see when a marriage when it's
[1:01:04] really working you can see that they can
[1:01:06] finish each other's sentences
[1:01:08] they can say they can almost say what
[1:01:10] they're going to say
[1:01:11] without even saying it because they're
[1:01:13] so fitly
[1:01:14] joined together they've worked all the
[1:01:18] kinks out
[1:01:19] they've got settled in and they know
[1:01:21] what they're going to do
[1:01:23] jesus knows what you're going to do
[1:01:26] before you ever do it he doesn't have to
[1:01:30] wake you up and say
[1:01:31] hey honey today's your day
[1:01:34] today's your day go out there and do
[1:01:37] such and such
[1:01:38] he knows what you're going to do he
[1:01:41] knows how you're going to act
[1:01:43] he knows how you're going to operate

[1:02:11] be known

[1:02:19] can you imagine trying to hide jesus
[1:02:21] over in the corner somewhere it just
[1:02:23] ain't gonna work out
[1:02:26] you can see some people they're
[1:02:28] embarrassed about jesus being in the
[1:02:30] room
[1:02:30] but you can't hide jesus if jesus
[1:02:34] is on the inside of your heart it's
[1:02:36] going to come out

[1:02:48] ten thousand octane power of the word of
[1:02:50] god
[1:02:50] and a holy ghost to light it up and to
[1:02:53] resurrect the power of god
[1:02:54] into a man's life for a woman's life or
[1:02:57] into a church
[1:02:58] that shoved that cadillac down that road
[1:03:00] yonder under thy dynamic power of the
[1:03:02] holy ghost
[1:03:03] which came and came back and was waved
[1:03:06] over the people
[1:03:07] at the day of pentecost making him the
[1:03:09] same yesterday
[1:03:11] today and forever there was the first
[1:03:14] chief come up
[1:03:15] from all the prophets which was the son
[1:03:17] of god
[1:03:18] the king of all the prophets he said
[1:03:20] there has been churches
[1:03:22] churches brides brides churches brides
[1:03:25] brides

[1:03:28] there has got to come a real
[1:03:30] by bride there must come one that's not
[1:03:32] only got the mechanics
[1:03:34] but the dynamics of it that makes the
[1:03:36] church live
[1:03:37] that makes the church move in the power
[1:03:40] of his resurrection
[1:03:42] mary you are highly favored
[1:03:46] you're standing in an hour of the
[1:03:48] restored and revealed word
[1:03:51] there ain't been no other part of the
[1:03:52] body that's had the headship
[1:03:54] set upon it but you we look at wesley he
[1:03:58] had a portion of it you look at luther
[1:04:00] he had a portion of it
[1:04:01] and you look at the restoration of the
[1:04:04] gifts they had a portion of it
[1:04:05] but now the headship

[1:04:12] the body
[1:04:15] let me say when you're preaching over my
[1:04:17] head no i'm not i'm preaching
[1:04:19] to what is yours the only reason that
[1:04:23] you may feel like i'm preaching over
[1:04:24] your head
[1:04:25] it's because you've not dug down into
[1:04:27] what this message really is
[1:04:30] and if you would dig down you'd find
[1:04:33] that this is more than knowledge
[1:04:35] this is a revelation
[1:04:40] i'm sick and tired of hearing that
[1:04:42] you're preaching over my head
[1:04:43] that's that's too far up there that's
[1:04:46] that's beyond my death
[1:04:49] i'm sick and tired of hearing those
[1:04:50] things well that's where that's for
[1:04:52] that's just for the ministry
[1:04:54] that's just for people that's been there

[1:05:00] it's for your newborn babies in christ
[1:05:03] the power
[1:05:04] of the living god is wanting to operate

[1:05:28] march in the army
[1:05:30] the sick will be healed by a word the
[1:05:32] blind will see
[1:05:33] that death will hear the dead will be

[1:06:20] anointing could strike
[1:06:21] and you pray a prayer of faith over
[1:06:23] somebody
[1:06:25] all of a sudden they come running in

[1:06:33] ranks when somebody come

[1:07:42] the godhead bodily
[1:07:44] and you are complete in him which is the
[1:07:47] head of all principality and power i
[1:07:49] want you to say that
[1:07:50] that you are complete in him
[1:07:53] and whom also you are circumcised with a
[1:07:56] circumcision made without hands
[1:07:58] and putting off the body of the sins of
[1:08:00] the flesh by the circumcision of christ
[1:08:03] buried with him in baptism
[1:08:06] wherein also you are risen with him
[1:08:09] through the faith
[1:08:10] of the operation who hath raised him
[1:08:12] from the dead
[1:08:14] and you being dead in your sins and the
[1:08:16] uncircumcision of your flesh
[1:08:18] has he quickened hath he made alive
[1:08:23] together with him having forgiven you
[1:08:25] all
[1:08:26] trespasses
[1:08:29] forgiven you of all your trespasses
[1:08:32] plotting out the handwriting of
[1:08:33] ordinances
[1:08:34] that was against us that was a whole
[1:08:36] stack of them that was against us
[1:08:38] all of the ordinances he blotted him out
[1:08:41] which was
[1:08:42] contrary took us to us and he took it
[1:08:45] away
[1:08:46] out of the way and nailing it to his
[1:08:48] cross
[1:08:51] you were quickened you were changed
[1:08:55] you were saved by the faith in christ
[1:08:58] jesus
[1:09:00] which faith was produced by the
[1:09:03] operation
[1:09:04] or the energy of almighty god
[1:09:07] it's faith in the son of god that moves
[1:09:10] you to believe
[1:09:11] that this is that which was prophesied
[1:09:14] by the prophet joel that in the last
[1:09:16] days i'll pour out my spirit upon all
[1:09:18] flesh
[1:09:19] it's faith that allows you to operate
[1:09:22] it's faith that makes you move
[1:09:24] to believe that all things are possible
[1:09:25] to them that belief
[1:09:29] it's faith it's faith
[1:09:35] hallelujah
[1:09:38] hallelujah you can go
[1:09:42] you can go and look over let's just
[1:09:45] change our
[1:09:46] change our our thought just for a moment
[1:09:48] or change our attention
[1:09:50] you can go and look over in the book of
[1:09:51] judges chapter 13.
[1:09:54] and you could see where the story of
[1:09:55] samson begins to grow
[1:09:58] how that israel had did evil in the
[1:10:00] sight of the lord
[1:10:02] by living in the land of the danites and
[1:10:04] living there and the philistines had
[1:10:06] come in
[1:10:07] and god because they had did evil in the
[1:10:10] sight of the lord
[1:10:11] and there was a woman whose husband her
[1:10:14] name was manoah
[1:10:15] who who was who was childless and had
[1:10:18] not bore a child
[1:10:19] but there came an angel from the lord
[1:10:22] and spoke to manoah's wife
[1:10:24] and said that you will bear a child
[1:10:27] and that he will deliver israel out of
[1:10:30] the hand of the philistines
[1:10:33] and you can read the story over in
[1:10:35] judges chapter 13
[1:10:36] how that manoa how that he he questioned
[1:10:40] and he sought the lord and he laid an
[1:10:42] altar before the lord
[1:10:44] and he stood out there and he was
[1:10:46] waiting for the inspiration of the angel
[1:10:49] to come and the angel said oh
[1:10:52] that the woman has said unto you it will
[1:10:55] be
[1:10:57] and you can go on and read and you can
[1:10:59] see the power that samson had
[1:11:01] you could see how he grew and that god
[1:11:03] would move on him
[1:11:05] and he would do the work that he was
[1:11:07] built to do
[1:11:08] because they told him that he would be a
[1:11:11] nazarite
[1:11:12] nazarite all of his life but he could
[1:11:15] not
[1:11:15] shave his head and he could not eat of
[1:11:17] the vine and he could not take of the
[1:11:19] strong drink
[1:11:21] that's what the angel said so as the
[1:11:25] child is growing forth
[1:11:26] you can watch as they begin to testify
[1:11:29] of what the angel had spoke
[1:11:31] to them personally and you can watch as
[1:11:34] samson grows
[1:11:35] into the man that he is built to be to
[1:11:38] be a deliverer
[1:11:40] of israel he's got samson
[1:11:43] he's got strength like nobody else has
[1:11:45] got the anointing of the lord can strike
[1:11:48] him
[1:11:49] and he can break he can break the head
[1:11:52] of a thousand philistines he can catch
[1:11:55] he can catch in life light fires with
[1:11:57] foxes
[1:11:59] there is a supernatural element in
[1:12:01] samson's life
[1:12:02] because he was the body that god was
[1:12:05] operating in
[1:12:06] to deliver israel out of the hands of
[1:12:09] the philistines
[1:12:14] all right all right
[1:12:18] now notice he said brother random said
[1:12:22] in
[1:12:23] in in the i deceived church by the world
[1:12:26] he said
[1:12:27] he said now now samson was a great deal
[1:12:30] like the church
[1:12:31] he said it started off right started off
[1:12:33] in the right direction
[1:12:35] he started off and and was called a
[1:12:36] mighty man of valor
[1:12:38] he started out serving the lord and
[1:12:39] keeping his words and doing his
[1:12:41] commandments
[1:12:42] and that was somewhat like the church it
[1:12:45] started off on as we would say in the
[1:12:46] world expression
[1:12:48] it started off on the right foot it
[1:12:50] started to keep the commandments of the
[1:12:51] lord
[1:12:52] and as long as samson followed the lord
[1:12:54] the lord used samson
[1:12:57] for god can keep anyone and use anyone
[1:13:00] that will follow
[1:13:01] after him for it's god's business
[1:13:04] but when he when we turn to a side away
[1:13:07] from the things of god
[1:13:09] then god cannot use us any longer when
[1:13:12] we will
[1:13:12] walk steadfastly after the commandments
[1:13:14] of god when we will
[1:13:16] stay in the pages of the bible and
[1:13:19] worship by the written word
[1:13:21] and worship him in spirit and in truth
[1:13:24] of the word
[1:13:24] then god can use any individual
[1:13:30] but when we take but when they take a
[1:13:32] notion to turn aside after something
[1:13:34] else
[1:13:35] then god cannot use that person any
[1:13:36] longer so samson makes a very
[1:13:39] outstanding representation
[1:13:40] of the church of today when the church
[1:13:43] started out god could use the church
[1:13:45] for the church walked diligently after
[1:13:48] the commandments of the lord
[1:13:49] and kept all of his judgments and his
[1:13:52] statutes and done all of his
[1:13:53] commandments and god was with the church
[1:13:56] but it seems to be that there is such
[1:13:59] a weakening place amongst the church
[1:14:04] by jesus so sampson
[1:14:07] when he started out as long as he was
[1:14:10] following
[1:14:11] the words of the angel and doing the
[1:14:14] words of the angel
[1:14:15] he prospered and he was successful where
[1:14:18] the angel had spoke
[1:14:20] but when he started turning
[1:14:24] from what the angel had spoken
[1:14:28] what the angel had testified and he
[1:14:30] started turning himself
[1:14:32] and giving himself over to the lust of
[1:14:34] the flesh
[1:14:35] then sampson began to give his heart
[1:14:38] over
[1:14:39] to the things of the world
[1:14:43] samson was not built for the things of
[1:14:46] the world
[1:14:47] samson was not built for for the things
[1:14:50] that delilah would put him in and you
[1:14:53] were not
[1:14:54] born for the purpose of living in filth
[1:14:57] you were not born to build you were not
[1:15:00] born or built to flirt with the world
[1:15:05] when i speak the world i'm saying
[1:15:07] everything involved
[1:15:08] when you were not built to flirt with
[1:15:10] the world nor
[1:15:11] dabble in the religions of the world or
[1:15:14] easy believism
[1:15:16] i've just confessed that you got the
[1:15:18] holy ghost and then you believe
[1:15:20] that you're born again and you walk away
[1:15:23] and you'll live a christian life
[1:15:26] you were not built so that you could
[1:15:28] come and just
[1:15:29] lay your hands on the altar and put your
[1:15:32] name on a book
[1:15:33] you were not built to be that kind of
[1:15:36] people
[1:15:39] that might work for the chicken the
[1:15:42] chicken pen
[1:15:43] or the chicken yard down the road they
[1:15:45] might be able to overcome their devils
[1:15:47] down there
[1:15:48] of easy believism of i'll just confess
[1:15:51] i'll be
[1:15:52] baptizing trinitarian doctrine and i'll
[1:15:54] be able to overcome
[1:15:55] that might work for a chicken but you
[1:15:57] ain't no chicken
[1:16:07] too many times it's trying to creep its
[1:16:08] way in this message i believe brother
[1:16:10] branham's a prophet
[1:16:11] i believe i play a tape i do this i do
[1:16:14] that my mom and daddy go to a message
[1:16:15] church
[1:16:16] i'm in it if you're not in christ you're
[1:16:19] not in it
[1:16:21] this message ain't just another
[1:16:23] formality this message ain't just
[1:16:25] another religion
[1:16:26] this message is deity himself
[1:16:30] embodying himself in a body
[1:16:38] we're not on a picnic where we can just
[1:16:41] get by
[1:16:42] with just confessing like joel osteen
[1:16:44] and just smile at the devil
[1:16:46] he might be over to come his devils by
[1:16:48] just smiling at him
[1:16:51] but you are coming face to face with
[1:16:54] real devils
[1:16:55] real demonic powers and if you're going
[1:16:57] to face those demonic powers
[1:16:59] you're going to have to have something
[1:17:01] to overcome them with
[1:17:03] you better be backing the message of the
[1:17:05] hour
[1:17:07] [Applause]
[1:17:09] joel osteen t.d jakes these great men of
[1:17:12] televangelists they cannot overcome
[1:17:14] laodicea
[1:17:16] they can have great works they can work
[1:17:18] in the realm of the second poll
[1:17:20] but they cannot live in the realm of the
[1:17:21] third pool
[1:17:22] [Applause]
[1:17:25] they can't work where you're working at
[1:17:27] they can't live where you're living
[1:17:29] at they can't do what you do because
[1:17:32] you're not feeding
[1:17:33] on what they're feeding on
[1:17:36] you're feeding on the unfailing body
[1:17:42] word
[1:17:45] i might go past my 45 minutes tonight so
[1:17:48] buckle up
[1:17:56] too many times people get the idea that
[1:17:58] just because they go to church that
[1:18:00] they're saved
[1:18:02] just because they raise their hand in
[1:18:04] some form of religion
[1:18:07] and sing some some song a few songs that
[1:18:10] they're okay
[1:18:15] you watch people you watch people and
[1:18:18] wow the worship is going forth and while
[1:18:21] the singing of songs is going for
[1:18:23] man alive you the thought that's the
[1:18:25] greatest christian in the world
[1:18:26] man they know how to really bring god
[1:18:28] down on the scene
[1:18:29] but watch them when the word comes
[1:18:33] they'll sit there in their old dead
[1:18:35] sanctimonious state
[1:18:37] and sit there and look at you like you
[1:18:40] don't know that they don't know what
[1:18:41] they're looking at
[1:18:42] ain't got nothing to do with me but let
[1:18:44] the singing cut loose
[1:18:45] man you'd have thought that she had a
[1:18:48] holy dress
[1:18:49] longer than anybody else in the building
[1:18:51] and he had the holy ghost
[1:18:53] like nobody before but when the word
[1:18:56] starts going forth
[1:18:58] watch the reaction if this word don't
[1:19:00] excite you
[1:19:01] i'd say you need to change your birth
[1:19:11] if you're okay with just worship and
[1:19:14] going home
[1:19:15] watch out the philistines are upon you
[1:19:18] [Applause]
[1:19:21] too many times people are okay with cain
[1:19:23] worship they're okay with the beauty of
[1:19:25] it
[1:19:25] they're okay with lifting their hands
[1:19:27] they're okay with singing a few songs
[1:19:29] of beauty and exhorting with their lips
[1:19:33] they're okay with but they need to move
[1:19:37] you need to move if you're satisfied in
[1:19:39] cain worship
[1:19:40] get up and move
[1:19:44] if somebody on your pew is not allowing
[1:19:46] you to worship and keeps you in pain
[1:19:49] worship get up and move where the fire's
[1:19:51] at
[1:19:52] get up here where abel is worshiping at
[1:19:55] where he dies on the altar
[1:19:56] where the lamb died
[1:20:01] i'm don't sit there
[1:20:04] i'm not preaching to you i'm just
[1:20:05] preaching but don't sit in that
[1:20:07] condition
[1:20:08] where you have to sit there and worry
[1:20:10] what that person's with through
[1:20:12] get up and come get up and come
[1:20:16] ain't nobody got no saved you here ain't
[1:20:18] nobody got set in
[1:20:19] set an organization get up and move to
[1:20:22] where the fire's at
[1:20:23] [Applause]
[1:20:30] the body was built to move and freely
[1:20:33] operate
[1:20:34] under the headship and the power of the
[1:20:35] head but many times
[1:20:38] the body's been bound
[1:20:43] it's been bound and can operate in the
[1:20:46] realm that it was built to operate in
[1:20:51] you can look over in revelations chapter
[1:20:53] 9 and you could see where 200 000
[1:20:56] 000 demons had been bound for all those
[1:20:59] years in the river of euphrates
[1:21:01] you can see those those spiritual devils
[1:21:03] that come out
[1:21:05] but you'll notice that when the seals
[1:21:07] were released
[1:21:08] that those devils were released or
[1:21:10] turned loose
[1:21:11] out of the river of euphrates and you
[1:21:13] can watch
[1:21:14] in revelations chapter nine you can
[1:21:16] watch as that smoke
[1:21:17] comes out of that bottomless pit that
[1:21:19] bottomless pit
[1:21:21] you can see as it rises up and if you've
[1:21:23] ever been in a smoke fire
[1:21:25] or if you've been in a place where the
[1:21:27] fire's at and the smoke begins to choke
[1:21:29] you out
[1:21:31] it becomes to get so blinding that you
[1:21:33] can't see where you're going
[1:21:36] and you can see that this layout i see
[1:21:39] in church age
[1:21:40] is so blinded by the smoke that's coming
[1:21:43] out of the bottomless pit
[1:21:44] politics are blinded like never before
[1:21:49] politics are blinded if you can't see
[1:21:51] that that washington
[1:21:53] is so disillusioned you need to wake up
[1:21:57] politics is blind religions are blinded
[1:22:01] because of the smoke that's coming out
[1:22:03] of the bottomless pit
[1:22:07] it was spiritual spiritual devils
[1:22:10] that have been bound in the river
[1:22:12] euphrates brother branham said it was
[1:22:14] that old
[1:22:14] roman empire and it was being revived
[1:22:17] again
[1:22:21] if you've been if you've been awake at
[1:22:23] all
[1:22:26] you can tell that the bride is up
[1:22:28] against a battle of unbelief
[1:22:30] like never before and there's such a
[1:22:32] binding spirit
[1:22:33] that's trying to bind the body that is
[1:22:36] coming from that realm
[1:22:38] of the bottomless pit that realm is
[1:22:40] trying to bind them over the spirit
[1:22:42] that realm is trying to bind your
[1:22:44] worship that realm is trying to bind
[1:22:46] your prayer life
[1:22:47] that that that smoke is trying to bind
[1:22:50] the preaching of the word
[1:22:51] so that the body is so bound that it
[1:22:54] cannot operate
[1:22:56] but i'm so thankful that if you just
[1:22:59] flip the chapter you can look over and
[1:23:02] see and i saw another mighty angel
[1:23:04] come down from heaven
[1:23:08] hallelujah he's strong enough to break
[1:23:11] the disillusion
[1:23:12] of laodicea he's strong enough
[1:23:15] he's here to make sure you get it he's
[1:23:17] here to make sure you get in the rapture
[1:23:19] he's here he's here to make sure brother
[1:23:23] uh
[1:23:24] gets his healing he's here to make sure
[1:23:26] our young people
[1:23:27] get a refilling of the baptism of the
[1:23:29] holy ghost
[1:23:30] the mighty angel is here and he ain't
[1:23:33] leaving
[1:23:34] [Applause]
[1:23:46] but you can watch catholicism as it
[1:23:49] tries to creep its way in
[1:23:53] just let the priest do it just let the
[1:23:56] preacher do it
[1:23:57] just let the elders do it just let the
[1:23:59] deacons do it
[1:24:01] just let the pastors do it just let the
[1:24:03] deacons do it
[1:24:04] catholicism trying to creep its way in
[1:24:09] the body was to be a body not to be a
[1:24:12] one-man show
[1:24:16] you know sometimes i feel like nobody
[1:24:19] else in the world is helping me preach
[1:24:21] but i can't do this without you and you
[1:24:23] can't do this without me
[1:24:26] we're a body you may think yourself okay
[1:24:30] but we are a body and we need every
[1:24:33] person
[1:24:33] and every person is vital to the body
[1:24:38] you say i don't feel too important i
[1:24:40] don't feel like i'm very significant
[1:24:42] every gift of the body is for you
[1:24:46] it's with you you say well i feel
[1:24:48] inadequate
[1:24:49] and i don't feel like i got gifts like
[1:24:50] these brothers or gifts like these
[1:24:52] sisters
[1:24:53] to sing like these sisters and pray like
[1:24:55] them brothers
[1:24:56] we are not perfect without you
[1:25:00] [Applause]
[1:25:03] we're a body
[1:25:06] we're a real team and we know that there
[1:25:09] is a diversity of gifts
[1:25:11] but it's of the same spirit we know that
[1:25:13] there is a difference in administrations
[1:25:16] but it's of the same lord and there is a
[1:25:18] diversity of operation
[1:25:20] but it's the same god which worketh all
[1:25:22] in all
[1:25:23] first corinthians 12 and 7 but the
[1:25:25] manifestation of the spirit
[1:25:26] is given to every man to profit with all
[1:25:29] for the one is given by the spirit
[1:25:31] of the word the spirit the word of
[1:25:33] wisdom to another the word of knowledge
[1:25:36] by the same spirit
[1:25:40] to another faith by the same spirit
[1:25:47] now i want you to know
[1:25:50] you can feel yourself inadequate but if
[1:25:52] you've got enough faith
[1:25:55] you just saw yourself in a body
[1:25:58] he said i never spoke in tongues i never
[1:26:01] laid hands on a sick and they recovered
[1:26:02] i never seen a miracle done i never seen
[1:26:05] interpretation
[1:26:06] i never seen prophecy if you have a gift
[1:26:08] of faith
[1:26:10] [Applause]
[1:26:11] we are a body
[1:26:18] working on miracles gifts of healing
[1:26:21] diverse kinds of tongues interpretation
[1:26:24] of tongues
[1:26:25] but these i worketh that one
[1:26:28] and self same spirit
[1:26:32] it's all laying in the ability
[1:26:36] to yield
[1:26:40] it's law it's all laying right there
[1:26:43] you see i yield myself to preach i yield
[1:26:46] myself to sing it
[1:26:47] and you yield yourself to pray you yield
[1:26:50] yourself
[1:26:51] to prophesying or laying on hands or
[1:26:53] believing
[1:26:55] it's all how you yield yourself i have
[1:26:58] to have to be honest i
[1:27:00] and you may disagree with me i don't
[1:27:02] believe you will
[1:27:03] but if maybe somebody on the internet
[1:27:05] might but i happen to believe
[1:27:07] that the gift that our pastor has is a
[1:27:10] gift of knowledge and a gift of wisdom
[1:27:12] to be able to reach into that realm and
[1:27:14] tell you things that only he
[1:27:16] would know it's a gift
[1:27:19] of the body we said well i wish i sure
[1:27:22] had that
[1:27:24] i wish i could see a vision brother
[1:27:26] burnham said you flip up in your bible
[1:27:28] every day and you're seeing a vision
[1:27:31] hallelujah
[1:27:32] if you have enough breath on the inside
[1:27:35] of your lungs
[1:27:36] to lift up a praise lift up a shout and
[1:27:39] yield yourself to a real worship
[1:27:41] to believe like never before
[1:27:45] you are setting yourself in motion
[1:27:48] in the body
[1:27:52] we all enjoy singing but this
[1:27:55] doesn't work too well without a piano
[1:27:59] player
[1:28:01] now i might be able to carry a tune and
[1:28:03] maybe a half a bucket
[1:28:06] but when the music gets to play
[1:28:10] it begins to ring out a whole nother
[1:28:12] level
[1:28:13] and breaks an atmosphere
[1:28:17] so we can't do this without one another
[1:28:24] it's all where you yield yourself you
[1:28:28] say well i
[1:28:29] you know i'm gonna take his ear right
[1:28:30] here i'm gonna put it down here on my
[1:28:32] nose
[1:28:33] so that i can hear people better
[1:28:37] they say well no way you know what i'm
[1:28:38] gonna do i'm gonna stick my nose right
[1:28:40] up here in front of my eyes
[1:28:42] so that i can knows in people's
[1:28:44] businesses better
[1:28:45] you'll find that you're not being very
[1:28:47] successful when you move
[1:28:49] parts of the body around but when you
[1:28:52] allow the body to
[1:28:53] operate as it's supposed to operate and
[1:28:56] not get into the flesh
[1:28:59] not get in the flesh of man i wish i
[1:29:01] could do that
[1:29:02] just step back just just take a deep
[1:29:05] breath
[1:29:06] breathe in breathe out you got the holy
[1:29:09] ghost
[1:29:10] you can raise your hands if you do if
[1:29:12] you've got the holy ghost
[1:29:13] you have been given the greatest gift
[1:29:23] hallelujah he said that
[1:29:27] that group the church had been bound
[1:29:31] there
[1:29:32] for 2 000 years for 2 000
[1:29:36] years at the river the demons have been
[1:29:40] bound there's a river euphrates
[1:29:41] he said but the church had been bound at
[1:29:43] the doors of dogmas and creeds
[1:29:46] he said but she is going to be liberated
[1:29:50] and she's coming back hallelujah
[1:29:54] you can shout i'm not bound you can
[1:29:56] shout i'm operating where i'm supposed
[1:29:58] to
[1:29:59] you are where you need to be at
[1:30:03] this message is everything you have need
[1:30:06] of
[1:30:06] he's your answer he's your god he's your
[1:30:09] all in all
[1:30:10] he's your everything he's your bright
[1:30:12] and morning star
[1:30:13] he's your alpha he's your omega he's the
[1:30:16] author
[1:30:17] he's the finisher he's on everything
[1:30:21] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:30:25] he said god hates a powerless religion
[1:30:27] it's got to have power in it
[1:30:29] it's got to have sincerity and sincerity
[1:30:32] brings power
[1:30:33] sincerity brings real worship not forms
[1:30:36] but genuine power worship
[1:30:37] to know that you pass from death unto
[1:30:39] life but god
[1:30:41] wants to perform his word by his power
[1:30:49] it's well i'm hungry i'm hungry
[1:30:53] i'm hungry to find my spot i'm hungry
[1:30:56] jesus said blessed are them that do
[1:30:59] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[1:31:01] for they shall be filled there's a real
[1:31:04] power in hunger
[1:31:05] and if you get hungry enough you'll go
[1:31:07] to seeking out for some food
[1:31:09] brother branham said that that even a a
[1:31:12] hungry child
[1:31:13] will eat from a garbage can if they have
[1:31:15] to
[1:31:19] i can't imagine getting that hungry he
[1:31:22] said but the only reason he does that
[1:31:24] is because he's not been invited to a
[1:31:27] clean table
[1:31:33] hallelujah the invitation is here
[1:31:36] you can eat up here where the table is
[1:31:39] spread
[1:31:39] and the feast of the lord's going on you
[1:31:42] don't have to live in trance
[1:31:43] you don't have to live in a dead state
[1:31:45] where you wonder
[1:31:47] well i will i ever feel the anointing
[1:31:49] will i ever feel the spirit move again
[1:31:53] he tore the veil that day at calvary
[1:31:56] so that you could be liberated
[1:32:03] there is a liberty in the body of jesus
[1:32:05] christ you don't have to stay where
[1:32:07] you're at
[1:32:08] you don't have to stay in sin
[1:32:12] you know i should stay in sickness he
[1:32:14] tore down that veil
[1:32:18] he tore it apart he tore down the veil
[1:32:21] of sickness
[1:32:22] he said i am the lord thy god that heals
[1:32:23] your diseases by my stripes you are
[1:32:26] healed
[1:32:27] he tore down the veil of glory he tore
[1:32:30] down the veil of fear
[1:32:31] he tore down the veil of sin
[1:32:35] he tore it down
[1:32:41] all it is is laying there is a barrier
[1:32:43] to be broke
[1:32:47] you remember when the prophet would tell
[1:32:48] us about that plane
[1:32:50] that would give if he could ever get
[1:32:52] past that sound barrier
[1:32:54] that he could fry it could fly freely it
[1:32:56] could fly and have no limits on it
[1:32:59] if it would get past that uh it would
[1:33:01] get past that cell barrier it could fly
[1:33:03] and it was limitless what it could do
[1:33:06] and he would say he said if you could
[1:33:08] only get past that sin burial
[1:33:11] he said you would fly into the promises
[1:33:13] of god
[1:33:15] fly their words limitless fly where all
[1:33:18] things are possible
[1:33:20] but let me say something to you that
[1:33:23] barrier of sin has already been broken
[1:33:26] the blood of jesus christ has broke down
[1:33:30] that middle wall of partition
[1:33:32] the blood of jesus christ has broke that
[1:33:35] barrier but
[1:33:36] there is an element or a barrier in the
[1:33:38] human element
[1:33:39] that makes a barrier there and that
[1:33:41] element is remembrance
[1:33:44] and if you can ever get past the barrier
[1:33:46] of remembrance
[1:33:47] you'll walk into the promises of god
[1:33:50] into the place that god ordained you to
[1:33:52] be
[1:33:53] if you'll just get hungry enough
[1:34:04] i'll tell you i i ain't never got enough
[1:34:08] of this
[1:34:13] i go to sleep eating i eat it
[1:34:16] in my subconscious i dream about this
[1:34:20] message
[1:34:21] i think about this message i wake up
[1:34:23] eating this message
[1:34:26] i do it all day long i feed on this
[1:34:29] message
[1:34:30] why because there is a hunger
[1:34:36] who put that there did my daddy do it
[1:34:39] did brother homer do it did one of my
[1:34:41] best friends or the greatest ministries
[1:34:43] that i've been a part of
[1:34:44] brother tim pruitt did he put that there
[1:34:49] who put that hunger there now i'm just
[1:34:53] identifying myself
[1:34:54] in a quote right here but if you can
[1:34:57] ever get yourself so hungry
[1:34:59] you'll break past yourself emily you
[1:35:02] sung that song
[1:35:03] break down break through break in
[1:35:07] if you could ever just break in
[1:35:13] you get hungry enough for worship
[1:35:16] you'll start worshiping
[1:35:20] now notice i'm telling you
[1:35:24] when you break that traditional barrier
[1:35:27] that jesus
[1:35:28] is way back and he isn't now when you
[1:35:30] find
[1:35:31] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:35:34] forever
[1:35:35] there's no limit to what god could do
[1:35:39] right here
[1:35:44] when you break that traditional barrier
[1:35:46] there's no limit to what god can do
[1:35:48] right here in this convention
[1:35:50] and show this world what they need not a
[1:35:52] world's fair but a world revival
[1:35:54] they'll be filled with a baptism and
[1:35:56] baptized with the presence of the living
[1:35:58] god and morphy
[1:35:59] invalid himself into a human flesh
[1:36:01] hallelujah i believe
[1:36:03] broken every barrier every veil every
[1:36:06] veil
[1:36:07] nothing could hide his presence he said
[1:36:09] when the people gets hungry in their
[1:36:11] heart
[1:36:11] there's a veil that's ready to be broke
[1:36:13] you can just depend on that
[1:36:16] that's a prophet's word nothing could
[1:36:19] hide his presence
[1:36:20] when people gets hungry in their heart
[1:36:23] there's a veil that's getting ready to
[1:36:25] be broke
[1:36:30] and here he
[1:36:36] stands
[1:36:38] what's that that you feel what's that's
[1:36:41] making this
[1:36:42] this body what's making this body move
[1:36:45] what's making this building all milky
[1:36:47] all over it's because he's standing
[1:36:50] right here

[1:36:57] brother branham is
[1:36:58] he is there and he's coming down to the
[1:37:00] end of the service
[1:37:01] and he said the building it's like it's
[1:37:04] just breathing
[1:37:06] like the building's just breathing
[1:37:10] what is it what is it that's happening
[1:37:14] here

[1:37:19] hide his
[1:37:20] presence nothing can stop him from
[1:37:22] getting to you

[1:37:50] satan has done his very best to curse
[1:37:53] this body
[1:37:57] i'm going to speak some things personal
[1:37:59] and i'm going to speak some things
[1:38:01] to the body itself satan has done his
[1:38:03] very best
[1:38:04] to curse this body he's done his very
[1:38:07] best
[1:38:07] to curse our pastor he's done his very
[1:38:10] best to stop the move of god
[1:38:12] he's done the very best to stop and
[1:38:15] limit god's
[1:38:16] power he's done his very best to curse
[1:38:18] us
[1:38:21] but i'm reminded i'm reminded
[1:38:25] that i will bless who blesses you and i
[1:38:28] will curse who curses you
[1:38:31] i've made a name for you in all the
[1:38:33] families of the earth
[1:38:34] shall you be blessed when satan has
[1:38:37] cursed you
[1:38:38] he's riding with a greater curse on him
[1:38:41] to hell

[1:38:47] blessed
[1:38:48] try to stop me all you want to the more
[1:38:51] i prevail

[1:38:59] from that realm that demonic realm
[1:39:01] that tried to stop the ministry at this
[1:39:03] pulpit
[1:39:05] just think about those cursings think
[1:39:08] about that cancer and all of its power
[1:39:10] and all of its fear
[1:39:11] and all of its sports but it ain't
[1:39:13] nothing but a bluff
[1:39:16] it ain't nothing but a bluff but you
[1:39:18] were built to get past that
[1:39:24] think about all the curses but you think
[1:39:27] about all the blessings
[1:39:31] here and in internet land you think
[1:39:34] about all the blessings
[1:39:36] that's come forth from the ministry in
[1:39:38] this past year
[1:39:39] i'm not just speaking to brother ron i'm
[1:39:41] speaking about a united body
[1:39:44] that is speak that is speaking and
[1:39:46] preaching on another level
[1:39:49] i've been a part of the ministry for
[1:39:51] over 10 years now and i have never ever
[1:39:54] seen a move of god
[1:39:55] like we're seeing now it's the final
[1:39:58] sweep
[1:40:06] i begin to think about this
[1:40:10] and if you ain't listening to sunday
[1:40:11] morning service and on easter morning at
[1:40:13] brother tim's you need to go listen to
[1:40:14] it
[1:40:17] but i can begin to think about this
[1:40:19] thought
[1:40:20] on the cursings of satan how that he's
[1:40:24] tried to curse a body
[1:40:28] and i began to think about god using a
[1:40:30] body that had been cursed by satan
[1:40:33] to not live but god anointed to speak
[1:40:39] you're going here that there was a gift
[1:40:42] of tongues
[1:40:43] that spoke out across the congregation
[1:40:46] you heard it
[1:40:47] and then there came an interpretation
[1:40:49] directly after it
[1:40:51] and the best that we have and the people
[1:40:53] that have stood around
[1:40:55] this came from a body that had been
[1:40:57] cursed by satan himself
[1:41:00] but god was so willing to bless a body
[1:41:04] and use a body so that it would operate
[1:41:07] in the realm that it would ordain that
[1:41:09] body
[1:41:09] i'm not lifting up a body i'm not
[1:41:11] lifting up a person but i'm lifting up a
[1:41:13] body
[1:41:14] when satan tried his very best to curse
[1:41:17] elena butts and send her to a premature
[1:41:19] grave god had bigger plans
[1:41:22] you can curse all you want to but god
[1:41:24] has decided to bless
[1:41:27] and this word came forth hear ye my
[1:41:31] people
[1:41:31] you can try with all your might but
[1:41:33] until you surrender
[1:41:35] yourself to god you will not walk in
[1:41:38] victory
[1:41:38] but once you give yourself over to me i
[1:41:41] will pour out a blessing
[1:41:43] that you cannot contain
[1:41:50] what is it it's all about surrender
[1:41:54] and yielding yourself over
[1:41:58] have you surrendered
[1:42:02] have you fully gave over
[1:42:05] have you fully been overtook have you
[1:42:08] fully been moved into a realm of the
[1:42:10] believer
[1:42:11] then prepare for a blessing that you
[1:42:14] cannot contain
[1:42:15] i don't believe that the blessings were
[1:42:17] in this world i believe it
[1:42:19] it is for the land of the living where
[1:42:22] we unite with our headship
[1:42:27] where eye every eye will look upon him
[1:42:31] and there she stands standing with him
[1:42:36] standing with him robed in the garment
[1:42:38] not spotted
[1:42:40] but blameless holy and pure
[1:42:44] there she stands because he stood for
[1:42:47] her
[1:42:53] hear ye my people hear you my people
[1:42:58] you can try with all your might but
[1:43:00] until you surrender yourself to god
[1:43:05] you will not walk in victory
[1:43:08] until you surrender you won't walk in
[1:43:10] victory but once you give yourself over
[1:43:13] to me
[1:43:14] but once you give yourself over to me
[1:43:17] completely yielded
[1:43:18] completely surrendered completely
[1:43:20] dedicated
[1:43:21] completely committed
