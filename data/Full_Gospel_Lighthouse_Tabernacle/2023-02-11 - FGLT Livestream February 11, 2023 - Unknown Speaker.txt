these needs this evening if he come and do that for us our heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just we thank you for allowing us to come and be here tonight and we're so grateful that we could we could come in a service and come in a building that that we can worship freely and and we can come and there's no chains that will bind us tonight because because you've set us free from everything that's tried to bond us Lord and and I just ask it if as we would come before you hear each and every prayer request it's been brought forth the sick the needy Lord the ones that I see brother Randy there and the and the test that he's got ahead of him but I know that you're going to be with him every step of the way and he may be away from home he may he may have different tribulations that come upon him but but Lord Jesus you were there and you were there in the valleys and you're there in the mountaintops Lord and and I just asked that you would just come and be with each and every one that's that's fighting here in this congregation the ones that are fighting cancer Lord we thank you for allowing brother Donnie to be able to be back in service with us tonight and I'm believing that your spirit will just sweep across this building and there would not be one sick Lord there would not be one that's that's fighting the the burdens and fighting the turmoils that they had this week but Lord Jesus your your grace could come down and you could save us from every every demon that tries to attack us and we know that we know that he comes in and he Roars like a lion but he's not the lion Lord he would just Roar as one because he he has a bow but he has no arrows and that's because he has no power and he's just a bluff and I'm just believing that you would just come down in a mighty way come down in a mighty way that we would be able to recognize who we are in this day and we're not just we're not just another being that would walk through this Earth but but we're a child of God and it is up to us to be able to take our stance and take our stance for you and because that's what you're looking for you ask to come back and see Faith Lord and and that's exactly what we're praying for tonight we're asking for more faith we're asking for more healing Lord Jesus but more importantly we're asking for more the Holy Ghost to come and flood our life and I just ask that you would just come and touch Our Lives be with the prodigals that are that are lost the ones that that don't know where they're don't even know where they're at their mind may be gone just now but I just ask that you would just go and be with them and allow them to see you allow them to see what can bring them back to bring them back into their right Minds wherever they may be at and I just ask that you were just anoint the pastor tonight anoint him that he would be able to bring forth a word that you know what we've been fighting and and you've heard we've heard them the past couple of weekends talk about the pastor may walk right down your aisle and walk it would almost be like he was sitting right in your kitchen and right in your living room as as you and you were having a conversation

Vessel with fire you'll never come forth as pure gold I didn't know how much he loved me until I passed through the storm and look back I didn't know Jesus was all that I needed until he was all that I had sometimes the storm that you're facing [Music] the fire just keeps getting hotter as the Potter keeps shaping the clay friends Jesus he knows what he's doing even though it causes you pain he just wants us to know that he's still in control and that he is still the same and you'll never be filled till you're empty until you're broken you'll never be whole until the Potter has tried Your Vessel with fire you'll never come forth as pure gold oh I didn't know how much he loved me until I Pastor the storm and look back oh I didn't know Jesus was all that I needed till he was all that I

of love [Music] but God has given us a promise that I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you this love that we have been given and the love that we give back to him it's not something that can be taken away lightly it's not something that we intend on the enemy ever stealing from us but this is a love that he placed on the inside of us it's amazing when you begin to sing those words in his arms I feel protected it's no place I'd rather be a man Jesus said that I have them in my hands and no man can pluck them out on them that doesn't matter what you go through positive or negative good things bad things you're in his hands and he's had you in his hands the whole time amen isn't He Lovely isn't he absolutely wonderful amen if you have your Bibles tonight we'd like to look over in the book of Ephesians chapter 6 and down to Revelations chapter 12. Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 and Revelations chapter 12 and verse 7. ma'am I know that you're aware that there is some weather or rain that is passing through tomorrow so we just we'll keep you updated in the morning if if things would happen to get a little sticky so we'll just uh we'll just watch and see we're anticipating on having service and don't look like things are bad but we we do want to make you aware that we'll text you if something does does change on that amen everyone have a wonderful week everybody good and comfortable tonight amen amen I I just feel like the Lord's about to do something very special here tonight I don't believe it's just my feeling but I think it's nah my faith is at a level that God can do anything right here tonight whatever it is I'd ask that you just kind of hold your need on your heart tonight that's that the Lord would be Hebrews 4 and 12 for you that he'd be the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart hey man how many has a need that you like to take before the Lord tonight by the way of an uplifted hand amen amen wouldn't be remembering our brother Randy and sister Wanda there and all the other needs let's just take these needs before the father Heavenly Father we come before you Lord Jesus Lord you are the most holy one father you are the the God who was who is and will shall forever be father and Lord we recognize that we are in your presence father and Lord we're not just Gathering here Lord Jesus to be gathered under this place father Lord a place a nice place Lord that has a roof over our head but father we've United our faith together Lord Jesus and Lord we're asking Lord that you would just come father and touch these needs Lord Jesus that you would speak to us lift the ear father according to your word Lord that you would just begin to pour out your spirit upon your children and father Lord I know that there are many things that we go through throughout the week father that that cause us to be distant maybe in our own speech between us and you father but I pray father Lord that right now Lord Jesus said you would come and break the barriers father that would keep us father from having a conversation with you and allowing you to work in our lives father I know that there are needs Lord that are spoken and unspoken here tonight Lord Jesus that you know all about and I ask Lord that the son of man would would make an invasion into our hearts father that you would come father Lord as you did through Moses Lord and you went down there and you took over Egypt I pray father that you would invade our hearts Lord Jesus and invade the this spiritual warfare that we go through father and may you show yourself as the King of Kings and the Lord of lords whether we fill you here tonight Lord Jesus whether we sense The Nearness of the Holy Ghost whether we feel something or not Lord we know that you're here because your children have gathered in Your Name Lord and you said where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst of them Father before before we could ever imagine Lord Jesus what you're going to do Lord there there was an angel that went before us that prepared our hearts and prepared our ways Lord Jesus and prepared our thinking Lord to to get into a channel father that we could we could gather the things that you want for us in this moment and Lord I pray Lord that you would just come here tonight and I bind every evil spirit father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind every sickness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ every little fear or little bit of anxiety father by the power of the Holy Ghost I bind those enemies that would try to hinder anyone or our brothers or our sisters tonight maybe they might be weak in faith but Lord those of us Lord that know who you are Lord we are confident and we are reserved in our faith Lord Jesus reserved in knowing Lord Jesus that we have confirmation Lord of our commission and that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost we invite you to come and do the demonstration of your word here tonight through our mortal bodies father Lord I know that you are obsessed with your word you are obsessed of bringing in things to pass so father by the power of my word and by the power of my life I step out of the wages now and I pray Lord that your obsession would roll over on the children of God and they would become obsessed with receiving the things that you have for them tonight that they would reach into an unknown World Lord Jesus that they can't see with their natural eye and they would be obsessed with seeing a miracle take place in their life I pray that you would pass through this room tonight and demonstrate yourself alive like never before in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray these things and the church says amen Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might be strong in the Lord and in the power of your might no of his might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities but against principalities and Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand or withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel peace and above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God Revelations chapter 12 and verse 7. Revelations 12 and verse 7 and there was a war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against fault and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony let's say that together and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death therefore Rejoice she Heavens you ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitors of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord as as I'd like to continue our thought from last weekend on elected to overthrow Satan's kingdom and that word that word overthrow it means to turn upside down to throw down to ruin to demolish to defeat or to conquer and to Vanquish as to overthrow an army or an enemy it is to that word it means to remove forcibly from power and there have been you can go back and you can study out the you can study it out in the in the United Kingdoms and you can go study out in the European world where there were men and there were kingdoms that had to be there were kings that had to be removed of forcibly from Power because of their their agendas that were different or differentiated from the nations of the nations of the world but we recognize that we are living right here in the midst of Satan's Eden and we recognize that there is a power that is in this room that is greater than the power of Darkness now we read this to you last week in that that from the greatest battle ever fought that William Branham said he said the first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels and it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on Earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven and cast out of Heaven to the Earth and it fell on human beings then the battle from Angels become human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself he had Satan come to destroy this he said that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on Earth and began in us and has been raging ever since it's been raging ever since so the battles that were Angelic battles have now become human battles and the things that you are facing you are facing in a spirit world as we went through last weekend of different spirits that we face and things that we don't see but we recognize that right here in the midst of Satan's Eden it is the worst of all the ages it's the darkest that it could ever be the prophet when he was when he was preaching in the seven Church ages he said the Lord allowed me to draw in a little bit of light in that last stage and to think that here we are when there seems to be absolute Darkness surrounding the Church of the Living God but there is a light that is down there in ghost sin when the rest of the world is down there in darkness the Bride of Jesus Christ is living in light and brother random said that God's Eden was established in righteousness but Satan's Eden was established in in God's Eden was established in righteousness but God or Satan's Eden was established in sin the very the very word sin means unbelief and that's where Satan's kingdom was built upon is on the very manufacturing of unbelief and we recognize that they are in the Garden of Eden there when when God God had a conversation with the serpent that he said I will put enmity between my seed and the serpent seed between the woman's seed and the serpent seed and we recognize that that battle has gone on throughout all of the ages you look at the twins that have came through every age of Cain and Abel and you look at Esau and Jacob that you watch that the battle between those ten twins of even Jesus and Judas and even right now in the land today there is a spirit of Christ and there's a spirit of antichrist and the battle is continually going on but the Bible is very clear to us in Psalms chapter 1 that blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of the Sinners nor sinneth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and his law and in his law does he meditate day and night that word meditate means to growl it means to speak again it's to say the same thing that's why the Bible is very clear to us in the book of Hebrews that he is the high priest of our profession and tonight when you go to saying the same things that God has said when you go to meditating over what God has said about you and said about this generation and said about this bride when you go to thinking about that thing it is you are a blessed people tonight to be sitting here to think that Eve was sitting there in a perfect Eden when a perfect Paradise where there was no trouble where there was nowhere there was no sickness where there was no pain Eve was in a perfect paradise and Eve still fail but there is a bride in the worst of generation in the darkest of times when there is no hope it seems like this Eve is predestinated not to fall like the eve back there in the beginning this Eve in the midst of Satan's Eden is overcoming every Temptation Of The Devil this eve will not fall this eve will not back off the word now I'm gonna preach with you I'm gonna preach without you tonight but we have been elected to overthrow Satan's Eden and Satan's kingdom foreign told us he said that the spirit is looking for someone to work through that's on both sides of the spirit of the enemy is working for somebody looking for somebody to work through and the spirit of God is looking for somebody to work through and we are going to be either motivated by the Holy Spirit are we going to be motivated by the evil spirit which comes from the Devil Himself foreign but notice the wicked or the unbeliever is influenced from beneath he said there is a trinity of hell like there's a trinity of Heaven he said they are influenced by evil Powers now notice he said the first thing when you start now he said the first thing when you find he said it's a realm here that's got the unsaved in it going through going through the Trinity of Hell of Hell of how the atmospheres of hell are set up he said the first one he said you find here he said it's got the unsaved in it he said there he said that's right he said that's where Jesus went in and preached to the souls that were in prison that's where he went and in the days of Noah when they repented not in the long-suffering in the days of Noah he said next is demons and he said the next is hell that is where our Lord Jesus Christ went to and he took the keys from the Devil Himself so there is a trinity of Hell there you see it's the unsage that depending not in the days of Noah second its demons themselves and in the Trinity the lower part of Hell the next is Hell itself where Satan is and he said the world is either influenced by the demon by the world is influenced by these demon powers through this Trinity and he said the Christians are influenced by a spirit too the Holy Spirit he said the first is the holy spirit above for Christians he said the next is the Angels but the next is heaven which is God himself so he got the Holy Spirit angels and God and he said the Holy Spirit come past all of them angels and came past all of them Realms to redeem ranked sinners like yourself you know that God doesn't care about your limitations God doesn't care about where you are God is willing to come past all things there's not a principality there's not an angel there's not a power there's not a sickness there's not a death that can stop the holy spirit for working in this place tonight you're going to be either influenced by this world or that world when Jesus took his disciples over in Matthew chapter 16 when he took his disciples over there and he told them that the gates of hell would not be able to Prevail against this Revelation he said I give you the power to bind every spirit and I give you power to loose every Spirit do you know what Jesus took them to he took them to cicery Philippi which is the gate to the underworld and Jesus took his disciples that he had full confidence in and he said this gate will never be able to Prevail against the revelation of the Church of the Living God that Jesus is the Christ now I know where I'm standing at tonight and I realized that there was an anointing in this room to break every yoke to break every Federal to break every sickness now before you think I get ahead of myself or you before you think I think of myself way too much I recognize that there is no problem too big for my God I recognize that there is no cancer case that is too big for my God I recognize that there is no power that is higher than our God remember we are serving the most high God there's nothing that can get above him there's nothing that can get below him there's nothing that can get around him so I know exactly who I'm sitting talking about tonight [Applause] I'm talking about a god that is known as a cancer killer I'm talking about a god that is known as a as a depression killer he is known as an anxiety killer he's known as a sin killer my God that I'm talking to you about has elected a generation of people in this hour to overthrow every Power of unbelief in this generation there will be a people that overthrow the kingdom of hell [Applause] excuse me I want you to notice I want you to notice when you read the Bible you are reading the very love language of God you are reading Heaven's language and I believe If Heaven talks to us in a way that we ought to be able to talk that same way is that right now notice now notice I'm going to take you just for a moment but notice in Luke chapter 1 and verse 46 that when Mary receives the promise from the angel that Mary said my soul doth magnify the Lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my savior for he has regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden for behold for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed for he for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name and his Mercy is on them that fear Him from generation to generation and he has showed strength from with his arm he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts and he has put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree if you look at that word in the Greek it means to demolish it means to overthrow that he hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree now the Bible tells us that we know how to we know how to obey and we know how to abound but God you didn't put yourself Where You Are you didn't ask for the high seat he gave you the high seat you didn't put yourself here you didn't get elected by men to be here almighty God this is a rigged election brother Chris and there is no president that can kick me out of my spot there is no weapon that can kick me out of my spot God chose me to be here and if I am ordained to be here you can't get me out of my seat you can't get me out of my spot I'm elected to be here Hallelujah is that right I'm elected to be here but notice notice this scripture can be looked at it as it is in the past when God would go and he would overthrow kingdoms or he would use his children to overthrow the mighty or he would or he would use the destroying Angel to go in and kick out the amalekites the the jebusites and all of them that were in God's kingdom you can look at it and you can see just like when God went down there to Sodom and Gomorrah and the the word is very clear that he went down there and he overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah now I know it's a it's a hard thing to preach about today but this Sodom and Gomorrah that you face and it's right in your face shall be overthrown is that right it would be more susceptible for Sodom and Gomorrah to stand in this day than to reject the son of man standing in front of you to think that right now that bear is standing in front of you on every course at every corner of the road Sodom is looking you at your face but they have been given up and they have been given over to a reprobate mind because they had refused to hear the voice that spoke from heaven now I know that there's a lot of people that don't understand this but there was one that spoke all the way back there in the beginning let there be it is that same one that spoke through every prophet and through every generation it is that same one that is spoke through his mouthpiece in this generation William Miriam Branham and there is a people who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age and I know there's a lot of people that might get sidetracked and get off the road and there might be some people that may wee boy and they may wobble but as long as you're on God's path you'll get right back in track because there is a spirit of unity that is here to make you stay in line with the word so you can look at this scripture that Mary that Mary allows this this language to come out of her she allows this language to come out of her that the Mighty God hath demolished but he hath given the seats or he has exalted them of low degree you can look at it in the past that when God or when David begins to sing that song oh how the mighty have fallen in second Samuel 1 and 27 when the news comes to him that the Philistines have destroyed Jonathan and Samuel or saw that this that this is when David begins to sing oh how the mighty father now God is a God he raises Kings and he sets down Kings but this scripture is not just something of the past but it is a prophetic word to the Church of the Living God that our God hath demolished the rulers from their Thrones as mighty Kings and Emperors from their Thrones as he often does setting up one and putting down one but this discourse that Mary begins to sing from the heart it is and discourse to the kingdom of the messiahship of Our Lord that is here Mary is singing to us the destruction of the kingdom of Satan and all of his demons and all of his allies and the final prevailing of the kingdom of Christ Mary is singing at the birth of Jesus what Jesus is going to do through his body before he ever got here he knew that you were coming before you ever gone going through your troubles he saw you in Victory before the Messiah took on a body he had your body in his mind [Applause] Hallelujah this is God's language I know a lot of people get offended at it a lot of people get offended at how are we how we act and how we demonstrate ourself but we're demonstrating ourselves by faith of this Living Word there's a lot of people that don't understand the faith of the Church of the Living God they don't understand how that they can go through trials and I'll say Satan himself don't even understand how that you can go through trials and he's still smiling how that you can go through troubles and you're still serving God there's a lot of people that don't understand why you're serving God the way that you're serving him but this is a love language that you couldn't have grabbed from somewhere else but you grabbed it straight from the Throne of almighty God if you go studying out the Bible just go looking up the word demolish or the word destroy I'm not teaching you something that you can't do I'm trying to teach you Bible doctrine that you have been elected by almighty God to destroy to demolish to overthrow to conquer to Vanquish every spirit every spirit is subject to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you remember when William Branham goes in there not going to throw the through the whole story but you remember when William Branham goes in there into that spiritualist camp and there there William Branham he saw and another brother was sitting there and that witchcraft spirit that was operating in in a spiritualist camp had that table floating around in the air and I want you to know I'm putting the devil on notice that this name of Jesus Christ will break every Power of Witchcraft it will break every Jezebel spirit it will break every rebelling spirit but when William Branham goes in there she recognizes this is a man of power but she said now let me now if you've got so much power why don't you command that to come down now notice he said now notice what he said he said now I don't have no power but I represent one and you remember you remember he didn't go in there in his own name he went in there in the name of the father he went in there in the name of the father and he commanded that table to come down now notice what happened not was he bringing down just the table he was bringing down the Witchcraft spirit that was making that table float in the air and I'll say this that the Bride of Jesus Christ has the ability to bring down every witchcraft spirit that comes against her a witchcraft Spirit comes from the spirit of adultery and the spirit of rebellion and they're exactly like a chain they link themselves together they link themselves together you watch every single time you watch somebody that is dealing with a witchcraft Spirit they're dealing with a spirit of adultery or they're spilling with it still dealing with a spirit of rebellion how did they get there they rebelled against the word of God they repelled against the word of God what are they doing they're linking themself up like a chain I'm not trying to throw you some gang sign right now but I'm trying to throw you show you that the enemy comes in and links himself together it's a chain on top of chain that it's linking itself together it's trying to break your spirit a witchcraft Spirit comes in and it tries to weave itself into your spirit and bring you down because it recognizes that there is a greater power that is in the room [Applause] foreign I'll call the brother's name but there was a it's all right there was a there was a there was a lady in our community never knew nothing about this church never knew anything about this message never knew anything about brother Ron never knew anything about myself or this church but she went to work through through a series of details of getting a job a brother went into this work and they began to talk about the Lord they began to talk about the Lord and specific things that the Lord had done for them and how good the Lord is and you know when you go to talking about the Lord that's when he shows up you'll find me that whether whether you want to hear it or not I'll try to turn the conversation towards the Lord because I recognize that if you've got a need in your life and I can go talking about him then he'll show up for you show up for your need s his brother had had met this sister and I didn't get permission to call his name from the pulpit that's the only reason I haven't done that but there there this this lady had went to work and she was a Christian lady she was a Christian lady in her own right and she came to this brother and told him exactly the layout of this church told him where people set at it and told him and told him different things that brother on was going through himself that he was in the midst of a battle he was in the midst of a battle and it was a witchcraft spirit that had got in had got in and tried to cause division amongst his church but she said don't you worry it's about to leave it's about to leave and when they leave and those people leave you will see the miraculous take place now I don't have to tell you when this was and I'll have to tell you where it was but I'll say this that the Witchcraft spirit that come and try to destroy this church and try to destroy her words she's not a message believer but she said these words that win that win that witchcraft Spirit gets kicked out that ultimate Revival will come he said your pastors are praying for specific things and you're going to see them come to pass [Music] now if God could deal with somebody that don't know nothing about this message how much more can he deal with you what was his Spirit trying to do the spirit was trying to stop our worship the spirit was trying to stop us from moving into the Realms of the Supernatural and I know what that spirit and I'm not trying to scare you off for trying to make you trying to make you think but there is even a spirit here tonight that of unbelief that is whipping in this room and it's trying its way like a snake trying to get through your mind and cause you to disbelieve what I'm saying but there is a name that breaks the power of the snake the power of The Serpent and the name of Jesus Christ binds that Mama Spirit you watch thank you you don't know what it was but I do when the Witchcraft Spirit left the miracle started following your worship went to another level your praise went to a high Realm [Applause] foreign time that had bought a house bought a house a message believer had bought a house and in the house somebody else had owned it had owned that house before him and he bought the house it went in there and they were every every night when they go to lay down they would hear people walking in the upstairs there wasn't nobody up there but there were spirits that were walking up and down this room and going back and forth through there every night they would go on finally this this believer said I'm I've had enough of this I'll tell you what hey one room for one spirit in my house and that's a Holy Spirit his brother said I have had enough of this I've had enough of this so we went up there and he took his Bible in that room he took his Bible in that room and he took all the brother random's messages that he had in his house and he laid them out and opened them up in his house he laid them up there and he stood and said these words now walk over this thank you and those Spirits had to shut down because they cannot walk over the word of God let me tell you you put this message on display the spirit that you are facing can never walk over the power of this message we're not teaching you some false Doctrine we're teaching you the most powerful weapon that is here tonight Satan cannot walk over the blood of Jesus Christ I put this message over every one of your life's Satan try to walk over them try to stop them try to hinder them we've only got one way to go and it's up [Applause] I'm tired of the devil stealing what God has meant for us I'm tired of the devil trying to steal our joy steal our peace steal our shout steal our message well you might as well back off me devil I know who I am I know I'm standing at [Applause] boo devil the devil Boone ever [Applause] and before the world began you were chose to accept this message and William Branham said you're anointed by accepting it you've been elected to rise above every Spirit of unbelief but predestination don't make you lazy predestination don't make you lazy or lackadaisical predestination will move you higher that when Paul would say in the in the most beautiful chapter while he's chained to a Roman god and he's writing out one of the most powerful powerful letters that has ever been wrote he writes out there is there no not therefore now no more change on them that walk in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there can be no condemnation there can be no change when the son of man has came by your way and loosed you foreign you remember when Jesus he sends his disciples out to go out and heal the sick command spirits to go and remember I believe it's Matthew 17. I believe I believe that's right you can you fact Checkers would let me know but he sends his church out and you remember you remember that that the man came to Jesus and he said look he said my son's alone are taking the off times falls in the fire he often falls in the fire he said but I brought him to your servants he said I brought him to your disciples but they could not cast him off and Jesus turns to them and said oh you faithless generation and Jesus has a conversation he has a conversation with the disciples and they said how how can we how could we not move this thing off of him he said if you had the faith as a say it size of a green or he said if you had Faith as a mustard seed you could speak to this mountain and Mountain be moved now notice Jesus wasn't necessarily just pretty pointing to the size of the Mustard Seed it's one of the most smallest seeds that you can see but he wasn't just pointing you to the size of it he was pointing you to the power of that Mustard Seed because mustard cannot mix a mustard seed cannot mix with any other seed it's got to produce exactly what it is so God is saying to you you cannot allow your seed of Faith to mix with time to mix with fear to mist with anxiety to mix with what you see you cannot allow your faith to mix by the things that you're looking at you've again you've got to look past what you see and Paul would say nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord foreign I can walk through the valley of the shadow of death because I am persuaded I'd say that Ron Spitzer's faith has been on trial and he was persuaded that no cancer demon that no sugar demon would be able to separate him from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus now you put your faith on trial just for a minute and you have the same conversation the same language that Paul had that though he was chained to a Roman Taylor but he was not looking at what he seen with his eyes he said in more than all of these sayings I'm more than a conqueror Satan you can try to chain me up but I am more than a conqueror you can try to stop my faith but I'm more than a conqueror I can walk through hell with this kind of persuasion in my mind that I can do all things through Christ Jesus who gives me strength year of God little children and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you see the Church of the Living God has been given power to cast down every every enemy there is nothing going to stop you there's no sickness that can hinder you there's no depression that can hold you back there's no devil that can withhold you there is no power in hell that is going to stop you you say well I got diagnosed with this a diagnosis it's not a verdict it is not your outcome just because the doctor says this or the devil says that a diagnosis is not a verdict it's just a mountain that God is asking you to move and he is obsessed with his children using his word to destroy every devil the cancer that runs rampant in Randy Hinkle's body is nothing to my Lord Jesus Christ the cancer that runs rampant for Ron Spencer is nothing to my Lord Jesus Christ the cancer that seems like it's whipping Erica Parker is nothing to my Lord Jesus Christ there's going to be somebody that wakes up to the fact that the Shekinah Glory is in the room and he's here to heal he's here to set free I'll say that even right now that Satan is losing his subjects I say right now that Satan is losing his strongholds that he's got on the Church of the Living God whether you're here or whether you're on the internet Satan is losing his subjects that one's long that one's gone that one's loose that one's free that one's healed that one's delivered now if you had change on you you know what it's like to be free let me tell you Freedom looks good on you Church Liberty looks good on you worship looks good on you the outcome it's not what the devil has said it's what God has said I can't see it but I believe it [Applause] who does Satan think he's messing with we have come too far down the road sister Phyllis we have come too far down the road to turn back now and to say that God isn't God we have come too far we've come through too many scars we've come through too many battles and we've seen him rise up we see him rise as a Healer and brother Brandon said now watch him as a warrior you think we're warriors but you let the language of God come out of his mouth and the voice of Resurrection goes on a war path against the devil and his children and his hips are what he's coming against the Church of the Living God sister Fearless I just have to tell you I'm just an eagle up here having fun and there ain't no devil going to break my wind and stop me from flying to another round [Applause] you're going to be either influenced by this world you're either going to be influenced by what you see you're either going to be influenced by the things that you feel or you're going to be influenced by a world that you cannot see Heaven is a real place the holy spirit is real I choose to give my time to him if you had to listen to all of the lies that have come against you and have come against every child of God it would be discouraging to some people do you think God hasn't heard those Whispers he's heard Every Lie that's been told on you he sees every regretting spirit that the enemy has tried to put on you but it ain't discourage God one bit it ain't moved God off it may have moved some people off but unbelief does not hinder God it just did it only hinders the unbeliever God is not worked up by what Satan is whispering in your ear notice notice brother Branham told us in things that are to be he said we came from eternal power from time beings mortal beings to time beings to Eternal beings when the word of God lit our souls and we became the sons of God and we are his attributes and took on the gene of God now think about that there is where William Branham is preaching to us what heaven's going to be like the things that are to be and we came from Mortal Kings to Eternal beings when this word it struck our heart it didn't take us to a ground level it took us to another level what is it it's the influence of another world you think about William Branham standing there Time After Time looking at that world seeing the angel seen him move now you go to believing you go to believe it over here somebody go to pray and somebody go to ask him he said I he said that light he said it's not hanging about two foot over your head sister I see you I see you he said you're you're not a native here he said you're not from here he said I see you he said that gray-headed woman set him back there you've been sick with this he said matter of fact he said you're not here by yourself he said you're here with a whole group of people you're from Switzerland he said go on believing and you'll be made well now somebody else go to pray and somebody else go to believe in you see this sister that's got that bronchitis in her throat right there now you was just praying you was just praying let brother Branham Lord let brother Branham say something to me now what was it was it either be an influence that's being let's be real true right here to ourselves was to either be an influenced by the realm from above or was it being influenced by the world beneath now if it was a world from beneath it would have made that person sick he would have made them in a worship in a worse case it would have took them into a lower degree but because the word came from above it could not take them down it had to take them up [Applause] don't you recognize what this Prophet has seen over this church that you would not go down in defeat but you would be Sons and Daughters of almighty God and you've been seen in a vision foreign I've been facing them all night and you don't know you don't know what I'm facing but I know where he's at but it's like it's like just like when when Michael was up there when Jehoshaphat was a righteous man and all of these all of these uh so-called prophets had come before Ahab and told him that the victory was Secure but Jehoshaphat was was so righteous that he said is there not one more in the land and Ahab said there's one but I hate him and when Michael stood up there he said I'm only going to say what the word of the Lord has put in my mouth he said I'm not going to say anything that you want me to say and all of these people these so-called Chicago preachers and all of the things said they'll line up with the message if we'll just go along with their water baptism or or baptizing in Trinity cutting women's hair and all of these details but we will not bow to any other voice we will not listen and we will not hearken but he said if you have gave you come back from this battle the Lord hasn't even spoke to me now what did he say he said a lion Spirit came out of hell and went up there and got him a maps of all of those prophets up there brother Chris what was it they were influenced from the world below it's just like Judas had the same flesh as you got walk of Jesus went out and did miracles he was a part of all the things but you watch he gave himself over to another spirit you watched the children of iniquity how they operate and how they work what is it it's a spirit of a devil that begins to work in them that Satan makes sense so appealing Satan knows how to advertise he knows how to get you he's not going to flash before you young people a Model T it might be fascinating to somebody like me or some of these other brothers but he's going to flash before you young people well they call that thing matters Stingray put that Corvette Stingray out there in front of you and this beautiful blonde-haired girl hair blowing in the wind this could be all yours for this price of your soul let me tell you he ain't sticking in front of you young people a grandma and a Model T saying I'm sorry Sarah I'm not buying are you with me but he knows how to make the advertisement appealing to the generation or the people that he's facing against so he doesn't come to us I said well I'll tell you what I do I put one of them rotary dial phones in your house and you can sit in there and gossip all you want to oh he'll put that little book of face right in front of you and make every woman a preacher I'll bless God I was reading over in my morning devotion I won't go no further but he knows where to attach himself to and make himself effective now that spirit's here I'm trying to show you both worlds but you remember when brother Welch Evans that his car got stolen that there brother Bynum tells us he said in explaining in the minute explaining the ministry he said brother Jerry he said he said now he said it doesn't work like this all the time he said brother well said come told me he said that his car had got stolen and he said he come to me and he said he come to me and he said he began to tell me about these things he said well brothers let's go to prayer and brother Branham goes to prayer and he begins to pray and there he tells brother well he said now look he said this guy was once a Christian and he said he said he's drove this car about a hundred miles he said he's drove him about a hundred miles drove this car about 100 miles he's pulled off at a bridge and he's getting over there he's going to get off at his side and this is where you're going to find your car out now what world would cause a man in that car that he's already stole to give up what he already took Hallelujah I hope you hear what I'm saying to you tonight what spirit is in this place to make Satan stop in his track and give back what he stole from the Church of the Living God give them back their Joy give them back their health give them back their peace our God is a consuming fire and he shows up and he shows out [Applause] I want to tell the devil that's sitting real close you give back what God already gave us it's rightfully ours and we have an abstract title deed and it shows that the token has been given to us we believed on the promise the Holy Ghost made it clear and it's rightfully ours give back it's my claim this is my inheritance this is my promise this is my healing this is my Deliverance but so many times people get caught up with them Tom I've not felt it yet I've not seen the change I prayed this and I'm not seeing it do you know that brother Branham told Brother Welch he tells us he said I had to hold brother Welch up for the vision to be able to come to pass you see because us in our human nature we'd have ran on down there we'd have ran home down there but because the prayer he said I had to hold him up so that it could come to pass I want to tell you that you've been praying for something and it's in this room and he's been waiting he's been waiting for the right time to make it turn loose now you may not believe me but your prodigal is already in the room your healing is already in the room your deliverance is already in the room I may you may not you may think I'm crazy or you may think I'm so far off some far off but I'm telling you that the promise of the Holy Ghost is in this room foreign I'm driving something because I can see it on you I could see it on you you may not see it on yourself but I can see it on you that you are letting yourself loose to believe that all things are possible you may not believe it but your miracles in the room you may not believe it but cancer is leaving the body you may not believe it but the things that you've asked for in secret he's about to make public you may not believe it oh yeah what world you talking about I'm talking about the world that you were elected to win in just one I'm not talking about some pie in the sky I'm not talking about somewhere off in the future I'm talking right now I'm talking right now that the Bible says in First John 3 and 2 that now are we the sons of God I'm talking to you that you have the power to pull down strongholds foreign do you really believe me can you trust these senses can you trust your hand can you trust your flesh can you trust what you smell can you trust what you see can you trust what you feel these things will let you down but there is a sixth sense in the room that faith is a substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen I'm very aware and everybody else is aware that Whitney's been asking for Zoe to start speaking the doctor's saying that that she's got this adenoids deal or a fluid on her on her ears but I I know it seems I know it seems a very out there but faith is out there but Zoe speaking is in this room yeah it's in this room brother Danny the things that you've asked for in secret they're in this room sister Sean the battles are over in this room depression back pain destroyed in this room you can't see it but I'm telling you they're in this room you don't see them but the pillar of fire it's in this room the anointing is in this room the atmosphere that you created invited him to do the miraculous [Applause] foreign relationships are fixed in this room tell me what you're talking about brother Andrew make it visible for me and I'll believe you floating in this room are things that you can't see TV this iPad has the ability to attach itself to things that we can't see them little buzzing boxes that you carry around in your back pocket have the ability to grab things that you can't see you can be out there on the Railroad and you can have a sermon from this past week playing and you're grabbing a hold of something that you can't see you didn't see this room when you were driving that train you didn't see this Pulpit when you were driving that train but it came into the room where you was at foreign it came into the room where you was at let me tell you let me tell you just as much as you can tap into the channel of a world of YouTube and grab something across Seas you have the ability to tap into the channel of faith and grab your promise out of it to grab what Jesus did two thousand years ago what did Elena Butch go in there and do she was leaning on the Everlasting Arms and she grabbed a hold of his arms and started dancing what was it she was dancing with another world foreign had miscarriages and it didn't look like we was going to have a baby but we started walking with another world said I can prove his teeth he said he started moving in this room he said there are Airwaves that are going through that only can be picked up by certain things he said by channel of radio he's got a crystal in there that he could reach in and he could touch he said he said you could say that great big word yes and he said that yes could be flying all through this room let's say that together yes it could be flying right through this room and he said what happens he said it comes to that transmitter and that transmitter has the ability to to transmit it into a wave of sound so that you can hear it and when that wave of yes goes through the room it comes and attaches itself to that transmitter and you hear yes you hear yes he said now he said it's like when the preaching of the word is going forth he said when the man of God reads Mark 11 24 that these things that you pray believe that you shall receive them and one person says yes and another person says yes and another person says yes he said before long he said you've got double the power or you've got triple the power he said but before long you've got a thousand power of yes that is operating in this room and you don't know it but you in your spirit are saying yes yes I receive your spirit yes I receive my healing Hallelujah yes yes I believe it I accept it it's mine yes yes he said same yesterday today and forever yes by his stripes I'm Healed yes foreign you didn't know what you was doing when you accepted the gifts into the body brother Bynum said that that was God's love token to the church you didn't know what you was doing but you accepted his dress flare in your righteousness clothe me in your blood make me pure [Laughter] there's something in this room your breakthroughs in this room your anointing's in this room the interpretation to your dream is in this room a cancer-free diagnosis is in this room your business problems are settled in this room he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him you've got to have his language he does not speak to you in a word of doubt he speaks to you in a word of faith and if you could operate through Prophets and speak to them it was a son speaking through them who do you think is going to be speaking through you who who did he go up there on the mountain to pray to who are you praying to what are you asking for you're not asking for my kingdom you're asking thy kingdom come thy will be done thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven yes yes it's his language this ain't my language I'm not trying to tell you something although something of days gone by I'm trying to tell you this is our language
