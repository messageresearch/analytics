[18:34] I just want to say from last night that
[18:37] when he first started talking about
[18:38] hunting, I took the kids for their first
[18:40] time hunting yesterday morning. It was
[18:41] raining. It was dark and the kids were a
[18:44] little scared when we went out in the
[18:45] woods the first time. But I told him,
[18:47] you know, the sun's going to come up
[18:48] soon. And last night he talked about
[18:51] that. It may be dark, but we got a
[18:53] light. It's going to come up soon. Let's
[18:55] all pray for these requests.
[18:58] Lord Jesus, we come before you today,
[19:02] Lord, as your chosen people. Lord, you
[19:05] chose us before the foundation of the
[19:06] world. We didn't have any say in it,
[19:10] Lord. We didn't have any choice. You
[19:13] chose us, and we're just so thankful for
[19:15] it today.
[19:18] Lord, you gave us the opportunity to be
[19:20] able to speak to you whenever we need
[19:21] to, Lord. Whenever we have something
[19:23] upon our heart, whenever something is
[19:26] going on with a brother or sister, we
[19:27] can come before your throne and we can
[19:30] say, "Lord, we need you on the scene
[19:32] right now." And we have these prayer
[19:35] requests, Lord. Lord, battling cancers
[19:38] throughout the message.
[19:41] Satan is just he's losing, Lord. He
[19:44] knows he's losing. And all he can do is
[19:46] throw darts at us, but those darts
[19:49] cannot do anything to us because of you.
[19:51] And we just thank you, Lord, that you
[19:53] can come down here. You can touch each
[19:55] and every person, Lord, that is battling
[19:58] in their body, in their mind, in their
[20:00] soul. Lord, whatever it may be, you are
[20:02] our high priest. And we just thank you
[20:05] for it. Lord,
[20:07] I just pray that you are going to be up
[20:10] there at that service today for brother
[20:11] Eddie.
[20:14] Lord, may this be an opportunity for the
[20:17] bride to see
[20:19] your power, Lord, to know, Lord, that no
[20:22] matter what happens on this earth, that
[20:24] we have an eternal reward that we're
[20:26] going to. And we're just so thankful for
[20:28] you, Lord, for what you do for us each
[20:30] and every day. I ask, Lord, that you be
[20:33] with this service.
[20:35] Lord, be with Brother Matt as he brings
[20:37] us what you've laid upon his heart.
[20:40] Lord, I just believe that you have
[20:41] something special in store for each and
[20:43] every one of us. I just believe that you
[20:45] have something that you're going to say
[20:47] to our hearts today that's going to make
[20:49] us that much ready for your rapture. And
[20:52] I just love you, Lord, and I thank you
[20:53] for everything you do. And I ask it all
[20:55] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[20:58] Amen.

[33:16] You can't feel it. But under your feet,
[33:21] new roots are taken home. Don't forget
[33:26] that we've got all things possible.
[33:32] Doesn't matter if it's broken or just
[33:36] ashes.
[33:38] There's hope. You're right in the middle
[33:42] of a miracle.
[33:50] Before prison chains ever broke,
[33:54] there was a captive.
[33:58] Before 5,000
[34:00] were fed, there was just one basket.
[34:07] If there was ever going to be light,
[34:10] there had to be darkness
[34:15] before there was ever an empty tomb.
[34:20] There was a cross.
[34:24] You don't see it. But you right in the
[34:28] middle of a miracle.
[34:32] You can't be
[34:36] under your feet. New roots are taken
[34:40] home.
[34:41] Don't forget
[34:43] that with God all things are possible.
[34:49] Doesn't matter if it's broken or just
[34:53] ashes.
[34:55] There's hope. You're right in the middle
[34:59] of a miracle.
[35:07] You have a future
[35:11] cuz he has a plan.
[35:16] I promise he's got you.
[35:20] You're still in his hands.
[35:25] You have a future
[35:29] cuz he has a plan.
[35:34] I promise he's got you.
[35:38] You're still in his hand.
[35:43] You don't see it, but you're right in
[35:47] the middle of a miracle.
[35:52] You can't feel it, but under your feet,
[35:57] new roots are taken home.
[36:01] Don't forget
[36:03] that with God, all things are possible.
[36:09] Doesn't matter if it's broken or just
[36:13] flashes.
[36:14] There's hope. You're right in the middle
[36:19] of a miracle.

[40:26] &gt;&gt; I give myself away
[40:31] so you
[40:33] can hear.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads this morning in
[40:38] the presence of the Lord. Our dear most
[40:41] heavenly father, Lord, Lord, this is our
[40:44] desire that we could just give ourselves
[40:46] away to you fully this morning.
[40:49] God, as I am just a man, my nerves here
[40:52] this morning, but God, I want to
[40:54] surrender my vessel all to you, Lord. I
[40:57] ask you that you just use me this
[40:58] morning that speak a word to these
[41:00] people. God, we thank you for what
[41:03] you're doing for the bride around the
[41:04] world, Lord. And we're awaiting your
[41:06] appearing, Lord, calling us away now. Oh
[41:10] God, I ask you that you'll just bless us
[41:11] this morning and keep us bless the
[41:14] reading of the word in Jesus name. Amen.
[41:17] Amen.
[41:19] Amen. Good to be in the house of the
[41:21] Lord this morning, isn't it?
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:25] Wonderful service last night and thank
[41:27] you for all being so attentive and being
[41:30] so kind to me. I certainly appreciate
[41:32] preaching to our home crowd here.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; I certainly love y'all. And uh so uh
[41:39] this morning I'd like to uh take a word
[41:43] that uh I'd like to speak with us and
[41:46] I'd like to title this this morning. How
[41:49] heavy was Joseph coat?
[41:51] &gt;&gt; And I'd like to begin in uh 2
[41:53] Corinthians
[41:55] 11 and verse 1 this morning. So if you'd
[41:58] like to turn there in your scriptures,
[42:01] 2 Corinthians 11 and verse one. We want
[42:04] to continue to pray for our pastor,
[42:06] brother Ron, that God would just
[42:07] strengthen him there in Canada and
[42:09] brother Ed's service this morning that
[42:12] God would just minister to Cloverdale
[42:13] Bible Way in a supernatural way.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 11 and verse one it says,
[42:25] "Would to God ye bear with me a little
[42:28] in my folly and indeed bear with me? For
[42:31] I am jealous over you with a godly
[42:34] jealousy. For I have espoused you to one
[42:38] husband that ye may present
[42:42] that I may present you as a chasteed
[42:44] virgin to Christ." Yes.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; And then I'd like to turn in our
[42:48] scriptures to Genesis 37 and 2, if
[42:51] they'd like to put that on the board
[42:53] there. It says, "And these are the
[42:56] generations of Jacob, Joseph,
[43:00] being 17 years old, was feeding the
[43:03] flock of his brethren. And the lad was
[43:06] with the sons of Bilha and the sons of
[43:10] Zippa, his father's wives. And Joseph
[43:14] brought unto his father their evil
[43:16] report.
[43:18] Now Israel loved Joseph more than all of
[43:22] his children, because he was the son of
[43:25] his old age, and he had made him a coat
[43:29] of many colors. And when his brothers
[43:32] saw that their father loved him more
[43:36] than all of his brethren, they hated him
[43:40] and could not speak peaceibly unto him.
[43:43] Amen. You may have your seats. This
[43:45] morning,
[43:47] as I said, I'd like to speak this
[43:49] morning on how heavy was Joseph's coat.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Now, this morning, I have with me a uh
[43:58] pretty heavy coat. This is a Woolrich
[44:01] coat my wife got for me many many years
[44:04] ago.
[44:06] And this is a
[44:08] if you was to weigh it,
[44:11] it's very heavy. I would say right
[44:13] around 7 8 pounds of how heavy this coat
[44:17] is.
[44:19] And I've layered it this morning with
[44:21] many, many colors to represent a coat of
[44:25] many colors.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows the story of Joseph
[44:28] in the coat of many colors?
[44:30] &gt;&gt; I would hope we we all kind of do this
[44:32] morning or else you're thinking Matt's
[44:34] robbed a marachchi band.
[44:41] So this is a coat of many colors
[44:46] to represent what Joseph carried. Yeah.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; So, this is a natural coat, but I want
[44:53] to use it in a spiritual sense of of how
[44:57] heavy
[44:59] of the burden that Joseph carried.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; How heavy of the burden that Jacob,
[45:05] Israel carried
[45:07] &gt;&gt; and the burden that his brothers
[45:10] carried.
[45:12] So the story of Joseph would begin with
[45:14] him proceeding to go meet his brethren
[45:17] to help with the sheep. And as they
[45:20] would see him coming a far off, they
[45:22] would talk amongst themselves. They were
[45:24] envious of how that their father loved
[45:27] Jacob.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; And J and excuse me, Joseph
[45:35] would say and he would tell and dream
[45:37] dreams. It says in 37 and:e 2 it says
[45:40] these are the generation I'm sorry not
[45:42] that one verse 5 it said and Joseph
[45:44] dreamed a dream and has told his
[45:46] brethren and they hated him yet the more
[45:51] &gt;&gt; and he said unto him here I pray ye this
[45:53] dream which I have dreamed for behold we
[45:56] were binding the sheav in the field and
[45:58] lo many she arose and stood upright and
[46:03] behold your sheav stood round about and
[46:06] made obedience to my sheep chief. And
[46:08] his brethren said unto him, "Shalt thou
[46:11] indeed reign over us, or shalt thou
[46:14] indeed have dominion over us?" And they
[46:17] hated him yet the more for his dreams
[46:23] and for his words. And he dreamed yet
[46:26] another dream. And he told his brethren,
[46:28] and said, "Behold, I have dreamed a
[46:30] dream more, and behold, the sun and the
[46:33] moon, and the 11 stars made obedience
[46:36] unto me." And he told
[46:39] it to his father, and to his brethren,
[46:42] and his father, Jacob, even rebuked him,
[46:45] and said unto him, "What is this dream
[46:48] that thou hast dreamed? Shalt thy and
[46:51] thy mother and thy brethren indeed come
[46:54] to bow down thouel ourselves to thee to
[46:57] the earth. So he was a dreamer.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; He was a seer. That's
[47:01] &gt;&gt; right.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; He would see
[47:04] &gt;&gt; things in the future.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; But they hated him for these things.
[47:10] They hated him for he was telling them
[47:13] that thou would be obedience unto me.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; But he was the younger one. He was be
[47:18] about 17 years old when he would go to
[47:20] feed his father's flock. But his
[47:23] brethrens hated the dreams.
[47:27] And the same thing is in today, people
[47:30] hate the spiritual.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; People hate the supernatural.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say in Joseph
[47:37] meeting his brother said, "When John
[47:39] came, he was supernatural. When Jesus
[47:42] came, it was supernatural." And the
[47:44] enemy on the fundamental side always
[47:47] persecuted the supernatural.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; The same thing that Joseph's brethrens
[47:52] did to Joseph.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; They'll do to you.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; In this day, they'll do the same thing
[47:59] because they hate that supernatural seed
[48:01] to come forth.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; But Joseph carried this burden of these
[48:06] dreams. That's
[48:07] &gt;&gt; right.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Carried the burden that his father is
[48:10] now even rebuking him. He's favored by
[48:13] his father, but he's rebuked.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; So, as they see him coming a far off,
[48:17] they scheme amongst themselves.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; They begin to talk amongst themselves.
[48:21] Let's take and kill him. That's
[48:23] &gt;&gt; right.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Because of the supernatural, they was
[48:27] willing to kill their brother.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Come on. Come on now.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; One said to the other, "No, let's not do
[48:35] that. Let us take and let's put him in
[48:36] this pit. Let's put him in this ditch."
[48:39] So, they would do that. They would take
[48:41] him. They would put him in the pit.
[48:43] And Reuben, the older brother, would go
[48:45] far off and and then his other brother
[48:47] in Judah would come and say, "Here comes
[48:50] a tribe of people. Let's take him. Let's
[48:52] sell him to them. That way his blood is
[48:54] not on our hands."
[48:56] &gt;&gt; So they would pull him up out of that
[48:58] pit. And I could just imagine Joseph in
[49:01] that pit bearing the burden. That's
[49:04] &gt;&gt; right.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Those dreams that he had had,
[49:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:08] the burden that he had seen.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; There was no glory in that pit.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; There was darkness in that pit.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; As I was speaking last night, that
[49:19] darkness seemed to press that light.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; But that light
[49:25] &gt;&gt; pushed past that.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Even in the pit,
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Joseph stayed steadfast to what the Lord
[49:31] had promised unto him.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And so when his brethren would
[49:34] pull him up out of that pit and they
[49:35] would sell him to them, he would be sold
[49:38] to Piper's house to be there to to help
[49:42] in Piper's house. And in Piper's house,
[49:46] he would then be accused, falsely
[49:49] accused by Piper's wife.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; But in this time, Joseph's brethren has
[49:58] schemed to put blood on the coat. That's
[50:01] &gt;&gt; right. to tell their father that a big
[50:05] animal uh something must have devoured
[50:07] him in the field. Must have killed him
[50:09] while he was on earth on his way to to
[50:12] meet us, Dad. And all we have found is
[50:16] this coat.
[50:17] I
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't Isn't this the coat that you gave
[50:20] him, Dad?
[50:24] &gt;&gt; And he would pick it up.
[50:27] He would say, "This is the coat.
[50:30] This is what I had given him in love.
[50:34] Bloody.
[50:36] That blood was not meant to be there.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; That was not one of the purposed colors
[50:42] that was supposed to be on this coat.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; And he mourned and mourned many, many
[50:49] days.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; And his family would comfort him. and
[50:54] his brothers would probably,
[50:57] excuse me, his sons would probably look
[50:59] at it and go, "Well, now we don't have
[51:02] to fool with that dreamer."
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Now we have that coat.
[51:07] We can show that he died. He'll never be
[51:10] remembered again.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; And there's Jacob
[51:16] holding that coat.
[51:18] The burden of holding his son's coat
[51:22] that he thought was murdered. That's
[51:24] right.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say it in Blind
[51:28] Barnameus. Could you imagine Jacob
[51:31] holding Joseph's coat for 40 years,
[51:36] &gt;&gt; bloody, thinking an animal had killed
[51:39] him?
[51:41] How heavy was that coat that he would
[51:44] carry for 40 years?
[51:48] I would say the first year that his
[51:49] brethren would watch their father carry
[51:52] that coat, it didn't bother them.
[51:56] They could remember what they did.
[51:59] But he would carry that coat that he had
[52:02] promised his son from Rachel,
[52:07] holding it bloody.
[52:10] Year two comes and he's still carrying
[52:13] that coat. I would say that it be to be
[52:17] a little heavier on the brother's minds.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; I would say that the torment that they
[52:25] had did to Joseph
[52:27] now was doing in their own mind.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; And that's what jealousy will drive you
[52:33] to.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on, buddy.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; The burden of other people,
[52:39] what you would like to have over them.
[52:43] what jealousy will do to your mind.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; It'll drive you insane.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Envy of wanting something else of
[52:54] someone else's.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Year three came and he is still carrying
[52:59] that coat.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[53:02] &gt;&gt; He's still remembering Joseph over them.
[53:07] Year five, year six, and he's still
[53:10] holding that heavy coat.
[53:13] No, it wasn't heavy as far maybe the the
[53:16] weight of it,
[53:19] but the burden of it
[53:21] &gt;&gt; that he's carrying.
[53:26] See, many people want Jacob's palace,
[53:30] &gt;&gt; but they don't remember him in the pit.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; They didn't see him in the pit.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:40] They didn't see all that his brothers
[53:42] had did to him, all that they had said
[53:45] to him.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; But it was for purpose. That's right.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; It was for a purpose that Joseph would
[53:53] be thrown into the pit.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Maybe God would look down and say, "He
[53:57] still trust me."
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Because even in Piper's house, says the
[54:03] Lord blessed him.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; The Lord looked up on him.
[54:09] The Lord was with him.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Even in Piper's house
[54:12] &gt;&gt; to make him ruler over everything in
[54:15] Piper's house, he was still with him.
[54:18] That's right.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; I'd like to read this. Sister Katie had
[54:27] sent this in our family
[54:30] text a couple weeks ago. had had no idea
[54:33] what I was studying on. But it says
[54:35] Joseph's dungeon was the very road to
[54:39] his throne.
[54:40] And he would have been unable to lift
[54:43] the iron load of his brothers. That's
[54:45] right.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Had he not experienced the iron in his
[54:48] own life.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Your life will be enlarged in proportion
[54:55] to the amount of iron you have endured.
[54:59] For it is in the shadows of your life
[55:02] that you will find the actual
[55:05] fulfillment of your dreams of glory.
[55:09] So don't complain about the shadows of
[55:11] darkness cuz in reality
[55:15] they are better than your dreams could
[55:17] ever be.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Joseph's dreams
[55:25] in that pit in Piper's house. He wasn't
[55:29] a free man.
[55:32] He was still a slave.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; He was falsely accused now thrown into
[55:39] prison because being falsely accused
[55:43] &gt;&gt; and almost to be forgotten. That's
[55:45] &gt;&gt; right.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; But see what he went through was putting
[55:52] him towards his destiny.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. And many
[55:56] times in our life we feel the burden
[55:59] that we have sometimes is almost
[56:02] unbearable.
[56:04] But as Joseph, the iron load that he was
[56:07] carrying was meant for him. That's
[56:09] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; He was built for it.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Many times, even in our own human
[56:17] nature,
[56:19] we would want what other people have.
[56:24] Maybe you would want a a house, a car,
[56:28] something somebody else has.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; You're jealous over them.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Why do they have it? Why can't I have
[56:36] something like that?
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's not a house or a car. Maybe
[56:42] it's a boat. Maybe it's grass. Maybe
[56:45] your lawn is not as green as their lawn.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; You're envious. Why can't I get my grass
[56:52] as green as they can? I'm going to find
[56:55] you this morning.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[57:00] Why can't my children act like their
[57:03] children now? Come on.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Why can't I sing as good as they can
[57:07] sing?
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Why can't I preach as good as they can
[57:11] preach?
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Why can't I have a church like they have
[57:15] a church?
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. Good.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Good preaching. His brethren hated the
[57:22] fact that he was loved.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; But they didn't know the burden that he
[57:27] carried for them.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; See your blessings in your life,
[57:34] you're carrying those things.
[57:37] And I would say that many of us, even
[57:40] though we have a nice home, a nice car,
[57:43] nice clothes, wonderful children, there
[57:46] is times that we feel that
[57:50] we're not worthy of these things.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; We
[57:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy of this.
[57:57] And there's times that you even suppress
[57:59] what God has given you
[58:01] &gt;&gt; because you don't want other people to
[58:03] think
[58:04] &gt;&gt; of how vain you may be. You say, "Well,
[58:07] these are vain things." No.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; If God has blessed you.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Don't live below what God has blessed
[58:15] you.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; He has called you.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; He has chosen you.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not talking about natural
[58:26] things now. I'm talking about spiritual
[58:27] things now. God has given you something
[58:30] on the inside of you. Don't live below
[58:33] your standards.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Good. God gave you a word. Don't live
[58:37] below them.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, man. Come on.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; The burdens you feel for your family
[58:43] that maybe aren't walking in this light,
[58:45] aren't holding this message, don't live
[58:48] below your standards because they're not
[58:50] &gt;&gt; living those standards. Good preaching.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Don't bow down to darkness. Don't bow
[58:57] down to sin.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; The Lord will be with you as he was with
[59:04] with Joseph.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; He'll be with you.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; And that burden of that coat
[59:13] that's meant for you.
[59:15] And God will help you hold that.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; But it's the other people that will say
[59:23] things, people that would maybe do
[59:26] things against you, maybe they would
[59:28] even murder you. That's
[59:29] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; In their sayings.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:33] It's a burden to their minds.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; I'm sure that there is even church
[59:38] members or people that would come
[59:40] against you and say things against to
[59:43] other church members
[59:45] &gt;&gt; and cause a negative a thought.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; In their mind.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Now that burden is upon them for what
[59:52] they've said.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; What they have done
[59:58] &gt;&gt; you live your life
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; according to this gospel. Amen.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; According to this word,
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; let them say on.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; This is not the first time of jealousy
[1:00:14] in the scriptures.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Let's just take it back to where
[1:00:19] jealousy began. That's
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; right. Come on.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Lucifer said,
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; "I will make myself like God."
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; He thought that he could do a better
[1:00:30] job. That's
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; right. Come on.
[1:00:33] I will make myself ahead of it. And he
[1:00:36] would deceive onethird of the angels,
[1:00:38] cause them to fall.
[1:00:41] And he would take
[1:00:43] and he would enter a man, a serpent.
[1:00:47] Now, that jealousy
[1:00:49] wouldn't just sit there in that serpent.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; It would go on to its seed. Come on now.
[1:00:59] Let's turn to Genesis.
[1:01:04] Genesis 4, I believe it is.
[1:01:15] Sorry, I thought I had it here in my
[1:01:17] notes.
[1:01:26] I do have it. It's just at the wrong
[1:01:28] place. Genesis 4 and1 it says Adam knew
[1:01:32] his his wife knew Eve his wife and she
[1:01:36] conceived and bare Cain and said I have
[1:01:39] gotten a man from the Lord and she again
[1:01:41] bare his brother Abel and Abel was a
[1:01:44] keeper of the sheep. But Cain was a
[1:01:47] tiller of the ground. And in the process
[1:01:49] of time it came to pass that Cain
[1:01:51] brought the fruit of the ground
[1:01:56] an offering unto the Lord and Abel. He
[1:02:00] also brought the firstlings of his flock
[1:02:04] and of the fat thereof.
[1:02:07] And the Lord had respect unto Abel and
[1:02:09] to his offering.
[1:02:11] And unto Cain, and to his offering he
[1:02:15] had not respect. And Cain was wroth and
[1:02:19] his countenance fell.
[1:02:23] Two altars,
[1:02:25] two unto the Lord.
[1:02:29] Cain brought a beautiful offering.
[1:02:32] So beautiful of the ground of what God
[1:02:34] had made.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; But here come Abel dragging his little
[1:02:41] lamb. That's
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:02:43] And I'm sure Cain thought, "What is he
[1:02:46] doing?"
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; What is he doing?
[1:02:51] And as he would bring that little lamb,
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; and he would put it up on that altar
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; and he would take a sharp stone and he
[1:02:58] would begin to beat that lamb, that
[1:03:01] beautiful lamb without spot, without
[1:03:04] blemish.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Said, "I want the best for the Lord."
[1:03:07] That's right. That's right.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; This altar that I have built for God, I
[1:03:13] want the best.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Cain's now looking at Abel. That blood
[1:03:19] flowing all over Abel and God's
[1:03:22] accepting it.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; God's accepting his sacrifice.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; But he rejected Cain's. That's
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; And he was wroth.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; See there? Jealousy.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:38] jealousy once again.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; But the Lord told Cain said, "If you
[1:03:46] will do like your brother,
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; I will have recompense unto you."
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; I will accept your offering. Just do do
[1:03:55] like Abel.
[1:03:59] He could not handle it.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; He could not accept it. That's
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; What was it? Abel had received
[1:04:08] revelation.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; As we was talking last night,
[1:04:12] revelation.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; I want to turn there again this morning.
[1:04:16] I want to read that where I had ended
[1:04:18] last night and said, "How did Abel know
[1:04:22] what to do in order to offer a per a
[1:04:25] preferred sacrifice to God?" By faith.
[1:04:30] He received the revelation
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; of the blood.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Cain didn't
[1:04:37] get such a revelation. He did not get
[1:04:40] such a revelation.
[1:04:43] It was the revelation of God that made
[1:04:45] the difference and gave Abel eternal
[1:04:47] life.
[1:04:49] Now, you might take what the pastor says
[1:04:51] or the seminary teaches and thought and
[1:04:55] taught and might thought and might
[1:04:58] taught you to do eloquently.
[1:05:02] But until God reveals to you Jesus is
[1:05:05] the Christ,
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; that is the blood that cleanses your
[1:05:09] sins and that God is your savior, you
[1:05:13] will never have eternal life.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; It is a spiritual revelation.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Just as Joseph had received supernatural
[1:05:22] gifts, spiritual revelation,
[1:05:25] it was a spiritual revelation unto Abel
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; of blood.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. that God wanted blood on the
[1:05:34] altar. God accepted blood,
[1:05:38] but it got him killed.
[1:05:44] Perfect type of Jesus and Judas,
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Judas wanted a beautiful worship,
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; wanted a beautiful seminary, maybe
[1:05:52] wanted to build tles and things unto
[1:05:56] Jesus.
[1:05:59] But Jesus said, "No, I want blood on the
[1:06:01] altar.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; It's going to take my blood."
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's maybe just a
[1:06:10] family thing that uh maybe just happened
[1:06:13] two or three times." You're right.
[1:06:18] David,
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; David would be anointed above all his
[1:06:23] brothers,
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:26] Because Saul had not done what the Lord
[1:06:29] had asked him to do. That's right.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; He was hated
[1:06:34] of this.
[1:06:36] Said in 1st Samuel 16 and six and said,
[1:06:39] "And it came to pass
[1:06:42] when they were come
[1:06:44] that he looked to El
[1:06:48] and said, surely the Lord has anointed.
[1:06:53] Surely the Lord's anointed is before
[1:06:56] him. See, he was even looking at the
[1:06:59] outward appearance
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; of David's older brother.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; He was probably bigger, better looking,
[1:07:09] better with a sword, more elegant,
[1:07:12] could probably have preached a better
[1:07:14] sermon than I'm preaching this morning.
[1:07:17] But you see, he was not accepted.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:23] But see, he looked on stature. Samuel
[1:07:25] looked on stature and accountants and
[1:07:29] but the Lord refused him.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; And the Lord seeth,
[1:07:34] say, not as man seeth. For man lookth on
[1:07:39] the outward appearance, but the Lord
[1:07:41] look upon the heart.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then Jesse called Benahab
[1:07:46] and made him pass before Samuel. And he
[1:07:48] said, "Neither hath the Lord chosen
[1:07:50] this." And then Jesse made Shemath, and
[1:07:56] forgive me on pronouncing these words,
[1:07:58] I'm sorry, to pass.
[1:08:01] And he said, "Neither hath Lord chosen
[1:08:03] this." And again, Jesse made his seven
[1:08:07] made seven of his sons to pass before
[1:08:09] Samuel. And Sam Samuel said unto Jesse,
[1:08:12] "The Lord hath not chosen these."
[1:08:16] And Samuel said to Jesse, "Are all thy
[1:08:19] children?" And he said, "There remainth
[1:08:23] yet the youngest, and behold, he keepeth
[1:08:27] the sheep." See, he had forgot about
[1:08:30] David.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Come on. Right.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; When Samuel asked to bring off his
[1:08:35] children,
[1:08:38] he had forgot about David.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; And said, "Oh, he's keeping the sheep."
[1:08:44] And said, "And he said,
[1:08:48] and Samuel said to Jesse, sendeth and
[1:08:50] fetch him, for we will not sit down till
[1:08:53] he come hither."
[1:08:56] And he sent and brought him in. Now he
[1:08:59] was ready with all of a beauty
[1:09:03] with all of a beauty count beautiful
[1:09:05] countenance and godly to look on to look
[1:09:10] to. And the Lord said, "Arise, anoint
[1:09:14] him."
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; For this is he.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; And Samuel took the horn of the oil and
[1:09:20] anointed him in the midst of his
[1:09:22] brethren.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; He didn't do it only. He let his
[1:09:26] brothers see it.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:28] And the spirit of the Lord came upon
[1:09:30] David. And from that day forth, Samuel
[1:09:33] rose up and went to Rama.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; He was accepted in front of his
[1:09:39] brethren.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; And his brethren hated him for it.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; His brethren hated that David was
[1:09:48] accepted. He was the youngest. He was on
[1:09:50] the backside
[1:09:52] taking care of just some sheep. That's
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:09:57] They hated him. He was They was jealous
[1:09:59] over him. That's right.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; It was a burden that they would carry.
[1:10:03] That's right.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm still talking about how heavy
[1:10:08] the coat was.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; But it's not just Joseph's.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; It's every single one of ours.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; They hated him.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; How do you know they hated him? Well,
[1:10:22] David went down because his father had
[1:10:25] sent him to the battle.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; And there was all of his brothers
[1:10:32] against the Philistines. And there was a
[1:10:34] man named Goliath that come out and
[1:10:37] would challenge.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; God of Israel.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; And there's David hearing Goliath make
[1:10:45] his threats.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[1:10:47] Now, his brothers had heard the threats
[1:10:50] over and over and over again, but they
[1:10:52] did nothing about it.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; They had the opportunity.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Just as Cain could have accepted
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; and have made the altar
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; here is his brethrens having the chance
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; to face Goliath.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. having the chance to take
[1:11:11] the same word of God
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; and kill this uncircumcised Philistines
[1:11:16] that was making threats unto the people
[1:11:19] of Israel.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; And he says, "What is this that y'all
[1:11:23] would let him make these cries?" That's
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; And his oldest brother then turns to him
[1:11:28] and says, "Why are you even here?"
[1:11:31] That's
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; You have come down just to see the
[1:11:34] battle. That's
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Why are you even here?
[1:11:38] make fun of him. Here's David quoting
[1:11:41] the scriptures and his brethren is
[1:11:43] hating him for it.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Making fun of him.
[1:11:50] And he would say,
[1:11:53] David would turn to him and said, "What
[1:11:56] have now I done?"
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; What did I do to you?
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; My father sent me. That's
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; right. I've just come down here and
[1:12:07] you're doing nothing about this.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; What have I done to you?
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Jealousy.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Was eating away at the oldest brother.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Because he was anointed.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; He was anointed above all of them.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; He didn't do nothing to his brother
[1:12:24] then. He didn't come down and make fun
[1:12:26] of him doing
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; but he was hated
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; because he was anointed.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. Amen. And he
[1:12:34] was carrying that burden
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; of that anointing,
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; seeing that supernatural come upon him.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; And he hated him for it.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; But David did as what the Lord wanted to
[1:12:52] him to do.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; He didn't just sit there,
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; He did something about it.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; And he went and killed Goliath.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:04] See, he was the king, he was anointed
[1:13:07] the king,
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; God was with him. That's
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Even as with Abel,
[1:13:14] even as with Joseph,
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; God was with him. That's
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Even in prison,
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; there's Joseph
[1:13:23] and here's the butler
[1:13:25] and here's the baker.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; And that gift that God had given him, it
[1:13:31] never left him. That's right.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; It had never left him even in prison.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, Lord.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; The burden that he was carrying was
[1:13:39] still with him.
[1:13:41] And there he was.
[1:13:44] And they said, "I've dreamed a dream."
[1:13:48] The butler had dreamed a dream. And he
[1:13:50] said, "I've dreamed that that I would
[1:13:54] have the have the chance to give the
[1:13:56] Pharaoh's cup to him again."
[1:13:59] And Joseph would interpret that dream
[1:14:02] and say that you would become his wine
[1:14:04] bearer once again. And here's the baker.
[1:14:08] He said, "Wow, well that's that's pretty
[1:14:09] good. I'm I'll tell you what. I'm going
[1:14:11] to tell him my dream, too."
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; But it didn't turn out the same way for
[1:14:15] his dream.
[1:14:17] Because in his dream, the crows would
[1:14:19] come and eat the bread off of his head.
[1:14:23] And when Joseph would go to interpret
[1:14:25] the dream of the baker,
[1:14:28] it wasn't a prosperous dream.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a dream that would maybe make
[1:14:33] him famous.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; It was a dream
[1:14:38] that would make him make him hate it
[1:14:40] once again.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; There's that burden again. Hate it from
[1:14:45] the baker.
[1:14:47] The butler loved him,
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; but what he had spoken come to pass.
[1:14:53] That's right.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; But he was forgotten once again.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Once again, there he was in the prison
[1:15:01] of Piper's house.
[1:15:04] There he was carrying the burden of what
[1:15:08] God had given him.
[1:15:12] There he was
[1:15:14] thinking that it's all gone.
[1:15:18] And God would cause a dream to come upon
[1:15:20] Pharaoh.
[1:15:22] And the butler would remember
[1:15:25] there's a man that can interpret.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; When all these wise men can't, there's a
[1:15:30] man that can interpret the dreams.
[1:15:31] That's
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; And there he would come and say,
[1:15:34] "Joseph, come tell me of these things.
[1:15:37] Tell me of these dreams. Tell me of all
[1:15:40] these things." And he would tell them
[1:15:42] the exact truths.
[1:15:45] There was no one in the home that could
[1:15:47] do that. No one in all the lands that
[1:15:50] could have done that. And there he is
[1:15:54] now. He's lifted up
[1:15:56] to Pharaoh's right hand. He's given
[1:15:59] power from Pharaoh.
[1:16:03] He's given him everything.
[1:16:07] And he tells him of all the dreams and
[1:16:09] he interprets all the dreams and gives
[1:16:12] seven years of plenty. Then there'll be
[1:16:15] seven years of famine. That's
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; And all the while, while Joseph is being
[1:16:21] now beginning to be lifted up,
[1:16:24] there's his brethren.
[1:16:26] There is his brethren on the back side
[1:16:29] of the deserts.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Still watching Jacob carry that coat,
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; carry that. And I would say by this time
[1:16:39] in life, the burden that he had carried
[1:16:43] was now so much that they they just
[1:16:46] couldn't hardly stand it.
[1:16:49] I love in the scriptures how in the very
[1:16:51] midst of this whole story,
[1:16:54] Judah
[1:16:56] and Tamar's story is told. Right in the
[1:16:59] middle of Joseph's story of being told,
[1:17:04] Judah's story
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; gets told,
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:07] Judah leaves his brother.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; I would say it almost became too much
[1:17:11] for him to bear.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; I would say that when he was watching
[1:17:15] his father carrying that coat, he said
[1:17:19] it's just too much.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; So he went down to the Canaanites
[1:17:24] and he took a wife,
[1:17:27] a gentile bride.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; And there Judah was and he raised sons,
[1:17:33] sons of these wives. That's
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:17:36] But all of the sons were evil in God's
[1:17:40] sight. And so he would kill them.
[1:17:43] In the midst of Judah ex trying to
[1:17:48] explain this in his mind
[1:17:52] of what he had done to Joseph,
[1:17:56] God is still going to use him. That's
[1:17:57] right.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; God is still going to use Judah.
[1:18:03] He's now taken his sons. And I'm sure
[1:18:06] that's on his mind of what he did to
[1:18:08] Joseph.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; He's now not able to have Tamar to have
[1:18:14] the lineage carry on.
[1:18:17] But now Tamar does something unexpected.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; She plays the part of the harlot.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; To receive the seed of Judah
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; to continue that line.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; And she kept a promise of a staff and of
[1:18:35] his bracelet.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; And when it come time that she was with
[1:18:39] child,
[1:18:42] they thought that she had been a harlot.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; She's played the harlot.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; And here she comes with this and says,
[1:18:50] "This is the man's
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; to whose child this is."
[1:18:54] And Judah says, "You are more righteous
[1:18:57] than I." Amen.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; In the midst of all of the hatred that
[1:19:01] he had had for Joseph,
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; in the midst of all that he had had seen
[1:19:06] of his family
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; dying. That's
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Think I would say that he probably
[1:19:11] thought my family's now cursed because
[1:19:13] of what we did. I have no clue where
[1:19:16] Joseph is at. That's
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; If I could redo the story, I'd redo it.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; I'm sure that burden was almost so much
[1:19:26] to bear. and now his own daughter-in-law
[1:19:29] is more righteous than he is.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; I love how how that is placed smack
[1:19:36] there in the middle of Joseph's story.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Because out of his lineage,
[1:19:44] out of his lineage
[1:19:47] would come Christ.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Out of his lineage would come David,
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; lion of the tribe of Judah.
[1:19:56] out of that out of that dark story, out
[1:20:02] of that burden that he was carrying now,
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; God would still use him.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you this morning, I
[1:20:10] don't care where you've been,
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; what you've done,
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; the Lord is still able to use you this
[1:20:17] morning.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; He's still able to raise seed.
[1:20:28] In the midst of all your trials,
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; God can still make a way.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; When there seems no other way in the
[1:20:37] world.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; When there seems like it's just totally
[1:20:41] impossible,
[1:20:44] God made a way.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; God made a way. Through all that that
[1:20:49] burden had been bared,
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; he made a way. That's right.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; And now we see that the famine in the
[1:20:59] land has come across all of them. That's
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Has come across all of every single one
[1:21:04] of them.
[1:21:07] But there was one in the land that had
[1:21:10] bread in his father's house.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; There was one that was now the bread of
[1:21:16] life.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; There was one that was lifted up.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. and his brethren had to go to
[1:21:25] him.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; The only place. That's right. The only
[1:21:31] place they could turn to was Joseph.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; But they had no clue it was him.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Had no idea
[1:21:40] that now their brother is lifted up. And
[1:21:42] those dreams that he had dreamed are now
[1:21:45] getting ready to come to pass.
[1:21:51] there. They had to come before him.
[1:21:53] Didn't recognize him.
[1:21:55] Didn't know him. He's in the palace.
[1:21:59] He's there set up.
[1:22:02] And he would begin to ask them of his
[1:22:05] father. He would begin to ask them of
[1:22:08] all the brethren.
[1:22:11] He was happy to see all of them. I
[1:22:15] wonder if we could say that. Come on.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could say that. If people
[1:22:21] would murder us with jealousy,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; if they would murder us with envy,
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; come on, buddy.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Could we still give them
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; bread of life?
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Could we still after all they done?
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Good preaching.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; After all the pressures that they have
[1:22:38] put you through.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Can we still give it to him?
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us, Lord.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Could we still do that? That's right.
[1:22:46] It's good.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; They didn't go through the pit. That's
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; They didn't go through the prison.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; They didn't go through the turmoils of
[1:22:54] all that Joseph went through.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; But he loved them.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; He loved them.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; That burden that he had carried for all
[1:23:06] of them years.
[1:23:08] He loved them.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; And he would give them the bread. He
[1:23:14] would give them life.
[1:23:17] And there when they would tell their
[1:23:19] father that he's alive.
[1:23:24] Let me tell you what,
[1:23:26] that coat that he carried, I would still
[1:23:30] say that when his brethren came to him
[1:23:32] and said, "Dad,
[1:23:36] we got something to tell you."
[1:23:41] See, many years ago,
[1:23:46] we played that we had killed him,
[1:23:51] but that's not true.
[1:23:54] We had sold him,
[1:23:56] but now he is at Pharaoh's right hand.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; He's alive.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:24:08] I would say that what Jacob felt
[1:24:13] was more than any emotions than any of
[1:24:16] us could ever bear.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; The emotions
[1:24:21] he had carried, thinking his son was
[1:24:24] dead
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; all them years, the burden that he had
[1:24:28] carried.
[1:24:30] Now his sons is telling him that they
[1:24:34] had false killed him, falsely accused
[1:24:38] and he's alive.
[1:24:42] I would say take me to him.
[1:24:45] I would say he'd take me to him.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; That's what he wanted.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; That's what Joseph wanted.
[1:24:57] That's what Jesus wants.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; So I want to say this morning, take me
[1:25:04] to him.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Take me to that king.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Take me to Jesus.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; He bared that burden. He bared that
[1:25:15] cross for me.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Take me to Jesus this morning. Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Though that burden of life that I have
[1:25:23] felt over and over again,
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; take me to Jesus.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; See, many times in our life, we don't
[1:25:34] know what cross people are carrying.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; So, I want to remind you, be careful
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; of what cross someone's carrying.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; That burden was meant for them.
[1:25:48] that prosperity was meant for them.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; They don't need you to accuse them.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; They don't need you to lift to take them
[1:25:59] down. That's
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; They don't need you to murder them.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; They want the best for you.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; He wants the best for you.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; He was the bread of life. Jesus bread of
[1:26:15] life. Right?
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; He was sold for silver.
[1:26:20] So was Jesus.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; He was cast into hell.
[1:26:27] So was Joseph. That's
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; But he arose.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; He arose to take all of your burdens
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; and say, "Give them to me.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Give me your burdens." That's right.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Because it's not even your cross to
[1:26:48] bear.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh God,
[1:26:55] you did it all for us."
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; All of this you did for us.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; More than accept it.
[1:27:06] He's did it for you this morning.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:27:24] Hebrews 12 and verse one and says,
[1:27:27] "Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed
[1:27:30] about with so great a cloud of
[1:27:32] witnesses,
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; let us lay aside every weight and sin
[1:27:37] which doth easily beset us." That's
[1:27:40] right.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; And let us run
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; with patience the race that is set
[1:27:45] before us,
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; looking unto Jesus, the author and the
[1:27:49] finisher of our faith,
[1:27:54] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:28:01] endured the cross,
[1:28:03] despising the shame,
[1:28:06] and is sat down at the right hand of the
[1:28:09] throne. throne of God.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Can you say thank you Jesus?
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you for bearing this.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Lay aside every weight
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; that would beset you.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Let him take your burden this morning.
[1:28:37] Amen.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Just bow our heads.
[1:28:43] Our dear most heavenly father,
[1:28:47] God, we thank you for what you did for
[1:28:50] us.
[1:28:53] Lord, this coat that we've carried,
[1:28:55] [Music]
[1:28:57] these burdens that we feel many times,
[1:29:01] God, thank you for just lifting them.
[1:29:05] Lord, day after day, time after time,
[1:29:07] they may come up on us, but we know that
[1:29:09] we can look to you, the author and the
[1:29:11] finisher of our faith.
[1:29:14] No God, I don't know what burden that
[1:29:17] people are bearing this morning here in
[1:29:19] this congregation or maybe listening by
[1:29:21] the way of the internet, but God, I ask
[1:29:23] you that you would just let that burden
[1:29:25] just fall off their shoulders this
[1:29:27] morning.
[1:29:30] Lord, I ask you that you'll just come
[1:29:31] and just dwell in us.
[1:29:34] Help us this morning, Lord. If there's
[1:29:37] jealousy in our heart, there envy
[1:29:40] towards a brother or a sister, forgive
[1:29:43] us, God.
[1:29:45] Forgive us, God.
[1:29:50] Lord, we love you.
[1:29:53] We thank you, God.
[1:29:56] Jesus name.
[1:30:00] Oh, I'm amazed
[1:30:04] [Music]
[1:30:06] that you love me.
[1:30:11] Oh, I'm amazed
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:16] at how you care.
[1:30:21] Through your preious
[1:30:25] blood I found hard
[1:30:32] and my sins
[1:30:35] are washed.
[1:30:37] They're all washed away.
[1:30:41] All my sins
[1:30:45] are washed
[1:30:48] away.
[1:30:52] No one knew
[1:30:55] how alone I was feeling.
[1:31:03] And the emptiness
[1:31:05] I tried so hard to hide.
[1:31:12] Oh, I laughed
[1:31:15] and said my life was
[1:31:18] without you.
[1:31:23] I was covering up the secret
[1:31:28] I
[1:31:33] think one day
[1:31:36] someone told me of your mercy.
[1:31:41] Oh, there it is.
[1:31:43] Oh, and the love you showed on a hill
[1:31:47] called Calary.
[1:31:53] There you hide
[1:31:56] and purchase my rejection.
[1:32:03] Oh, when you rose power and set my
[1:32:08] spirit

[1:38:16] but he didn't complain.
[1:38:23] He's here to take your burdens this
[1:38:24] morning.
[1:38:26] Maybe you got a burden you've been
[1:38:27] bearing. You don't realize you're
[1:38:28] bearing it. You think it's just your
[1:38:30] burden to bear,
[1:38:32] but he already took it for you.
[1:38:34] Won't you lay it down this morning?
[1:38:36] Won't say, "Father, Lord, take me, Lord.
[1:38:39] Help me, Lord Jesus. Lord, it gets hard
[1:38:41] to walk with this burden, but don't you
[1:38:43] realize he already paid the price for
[1:38:47] it. He already went ahead of you and
[1:38:49] made a way where you couldn't make a
[1:38:51] way. He's the bread of life this
[1:38:53] morning. He's here for you to feed upon
[1:38:55] him." How many loves being in the house
[1:38:57] of God this morning? Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:01] Wasn't it good to be in the house of God
[1:39:03] this morning? Father, bring this to our
[1:39:06] remembrance on Tuesday when our burdens
[1:39:09] start get heavy again. We got a place we
[1:39:11] can go. Aren't you thankful for that? I
[1:39:13] want to sing a song. I've never sang
[1:39:15] this before, but we're going to sing it
[1:39:17] or we're going to mess it up and we're
[1:39:18] going to look good doing it. All right.
[1:39:20] Well, praise the Lord. I got joy in my
[1:39:23] soul and God is in control. I got Satan
[1:39:28] on my trail, but I'm saying all his
[1:39:32] will. He's packing every day, but I'm
[1:39:37] watching while I pray. No matter the
[1:39:41] attack, I won't turn back. Oh, this
[1:39:44] needs more.
[1:39:49] It needs more.
[1:39:52] I got joy in my soul and God is in
[1:39:57] control. I got Satan on my trail, but
[1:40:02] I'm saying all his way. He's attacking
[1:40:06] every day.

[1:40:48] in the storm and the rain, but the blood
[1:40:53] still stays the same. Whatever's going
[1:40:57] wrong, my world goes hard.
[1:41:01] Why me?
[1:41:04] Don't let him have your praise.
[1:41:06] [Music]
[1:41:08] No matter the attack, I won't do that.
[1:41:12] Oh, this me.
[1:41:17] This me. Oh, I plead.

[1:42:24] plead the blood.
[1:42:28] Oh, I plead I plead the love.
