[0:36] evening a man we certainly love you with
[0:39] all of our hearts and a man I I believe
[0:43] we've got some folks from brother
[0:44] bisko's sister charity sister star so
[0:46] good to see you guys with us in the
[0:48] house of the Lord hunter it's good to
[0:51] see you a man each and every one of you
[0:53] brother soccer god bless you a man we
[0:57] have a very special friend with us
[0:59] tonight and and he's a buddy of mine in
[1:01] his name is Carlos and Carlos has been a
[1:05] friend he's a young man back in the back
[1:07] and he's been on he's been a long time
[1:10] coming and so I'm so glad to have him
[1:12] with us tonight and a man in his wife
[1:15] [Applause]
[1:23] hallelujah
[1:24] [Applause]
[1:28] so good to see you in the house of the
[1:30] Lord this afternoon
[1:31] a man's sister Gooden has had enough I
[1:33] think she's okay she's had an emergency
[1:35] and they're going to be checking on her
[1:37] and so thank you for your prayers with
[1:39] that amen good to be in the house of the
[1:42] Lord you know it's it couldn't be in a
[1:44] better place to have an emergency and so
[1:47] we just think the Lord for those things
[1:49] and God will just watch over to provide
[1:52] for us and be with us and amen and so if
[1:54] you see some lights they're coming to
[1:56] pick her up and take care of her and we
[1:58] thank the Lord for that and just be glad
[2:01] it's not you a man a man god bless you
[2:05] if you turn with me in your scriptures
[2:06] tonight I'd like to look to Psalms 23
[2:10] how many enjoyed last night I tell you
[2:14] we had an awesome time here last night
[2:16] I thought brother we had a for speaker
[2:19] you call that a preacher quartet and so
[2:22] so last night we had brother Matthew and
[2:25] he just did a phenomenal job to start it
[2:27] out and then brother William has
[2:30] preached once more I just the way I
[2:31] could remember that just once more Lord
[2:34] and then brother Andrew came and spoke
[2:36] to us last night and we know what Andrew
[2:38] is capable of and so we just thank the
[2:41] Lord for that and we just I just like to
[2:44] just kind of take it from that point
[2:46] from last night to today and I'd say
[2:48] we'll have church amen amen
[2:53] we have read the scripture sin was sin
[2:55] so we were a child how many could say
[2:59] that that's true in your life that
[3:01] you've read Psalms 23 since you were a
[3:04] child it's more than a song it's more
[3:08] than poetry but it's a covenant between
[3:11] God and you if you'll remember God told
[3:17] Abraham I'll make a covenant between me
[3:21] and thee and when God says that it's
[3:25] infinite it it's not time-sensitive
[3:28] brother Josh and it's not you know it's
[3:31] not something that we just go well you
[3:34] know like a man will break his words but
[3:36] God says I'm making a covenant with
[3:39] you and so this is a song that is a
[3:43] covenant a man I'd like first to read it
[3:47] together if we can if we can do that the
[3:51] Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he
[3:55] maketh me to lie down in green pastures
[3:59] he leadeth me beside the still waters
[4:02] and he restoreth my soul and he leadeth
[4:06] me in the paths of righteousness for his
[4:09] name's sake and yea though I walk
[4:12] through the valley of the shadow of
[4:14] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[4:18] with me and thy staff they comfort me
[4:23] thou prepare a table before me in the
[4:27] presence of mine enemies thou anointest
[4:29] my head with all my cup runneth over
[4:32] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[4:36] me all the days of my life and I will
[4:40] dwell in the house of the Lord for ever
[4:46] Psalms 27 and verse 1 says it like this
[4:50] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[4:53] whom shall I fear I want you to say
[4:58] those words with me whom shall I fear
[5:01] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[5:04] whom shall I be afraid when the wicked
[5:08] even mine enemies and my foes came upon
[5:11] me to eat my flesh they stumbled and
[5:13] fell though a host should encamp against
[5:16] me my heart shall not fear the war
[5:18] should rise against me and this will I
[5:20] be confident one thing that I have
[5:23] desired of the Lord that I will seek
[5:24] after that I may dwell in the house of
[5:27] the Lord all the days of my life to
[5:30] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[5:32] enquire in his temple amen maybe you
[5:35] have a need tonight you just like say
[5:37] your brother Ron I'd like for the Lord
[5:38] to remember me this evening amen let's
[5:42] pray amen god bless you Lord Jesus we
[5:45] bow our heads before you now Lord with
[5:48] great need in our lives that you would
[5:50] sweep by our way
[5:52] now Lord we ask you to touch sister
[5:54] Sarah that you would touch her body
[5:56] she's in good hands even right now and
[5:59] lord I I just ask you that you would be
[6:02] with the family there watch over them
[6:04] those that are taking care of her bless
[6:07] them now
[6:07] we ask you Lord that you would sweep
[6:09] across this audience in a very
[6:11] supernatural way we pray that you would
[6:14] come on the scene for us this evening
[6:16] and strengthen our hearts and our lives
[6:17] Lord you're a god that's rich in mercy
[6:20] and the Lord as much as you have
[6:22] anointed us to prepare for this evening
[6:24] will Lord there's a people that's
[6:26] prepared to hear your word our hands
[6:29] defied gravity and then the define of
[6:33] gravity we reach to a God that hears and
[6:36] answers prayer now there's not a job too
[6:39] big or too small for you to handle and
[6:42] Lord we bring our needs before you in
[6:45] sincere devotion just now in Jesus
[6:48] Christ's name we pray amen and a man and
[6:52] a man you may be seated for a few weeks
[7:07] this has been on my heart and so this
[7:10] seems to be the night that to deliver it
[7:12] to you with all the circumstances are
[7:16] going on I think it's kind of
[7:17] interesting that this is our subject for
[7:19] the evening I want to speak to you on
[7:21] laying it all on the line laying it all
[7:27] on the line you see the lines define
[7:32] boundaries boundaries are fought over
[7:35] whether as a nation or as a state or as
[7:38] a county or municipality families
[7:42] properties are you with me now
[7:46] wars are fought over property lines and
[7:49] nations fight over even Antarctica and
[7:52] the Arctic Circle they fight over the
[7:54] walls and they fight over the different
[7:57] military powers and actually even in the
[8:01] media they fight over the boundaries of
[8:03] of what is what
[8:05] one of the most outstanding sermons is
[8:08] the greatest battle that's ever fought
[8:09] because when a man is to take place
[8:13] there is a choice of where the
[8:15] battleground is going to be at you see
[8:18] not to destroy populations or home
[8:21] territories but to to fight it on a
[8:24] neutral ground is where you contest the
[8:28] great two forces against one another
[8:30] you see God and Satan chose to fight in
[8:35] the Battle of a mind of a human being
[8:39] being that your flesh is never born
[8:42] again and there will always be a seeking
[8:44] for more of God your flesh contests with
[8:48] your soul that when that soul becomes
[8:52] ignited to where you really know who you
[8:54] are that you're a seed of God and
[8:57] there's no more argument all you may
[9:00] have been a drunk and you may have been
[9:02] a an addict and you may have been a lot
[9:04] of things in your life even religious
[9:06] fanatic but when you meet Jesus and he
[9:12] places his life on the inside of you
[9:16] that it's no more your desires living
[9:22] are you with me so even in this flesh
[9:25] there's boundary lines and Satan can
[9:29] fight with your flesh he can contest
[9:35] with your flesh in your flesh you have
[9:37] emotions you have you have all different
[9:40] kinds of feelings and seeing you here
[9:43] and Satan will bombard you in in all of
[9:47] those things and then he will go into
[9:48] your spirit there he can contest with
[9:51] your emotions and your your reasons and
[9:54] your conscience and and your memory now
[9:58] something you've been Christians for 50
[10:00] years
[10:00] but I find it absolutely an amazing that
[10:03] Satan can reignite memories
[10:10] you can have a perfectly good day and
[10:14] all of a sudden you'll just get a clip
[10:16] in your mind you'll just kind of go go
[10:19] across like a TV screen and you'll bring
[10:21] up a picture of an old girlfriend or an
[10:28] old old situation of your life and oh my
[10:32] brother on that don't bother me well
[10:34] I've been with the light of you at
[10:35] restaurants and you know music can come
[10:37] on and that old time rock and roll and
[10:42] your foot no matter how converted you
[10:45] are your foot starts or you say well
[11:00] brother Ron I'm not moved by that we'll
[11:02] just talk about politics for about five
[11:04] minutes and you'll find out that you can
[11:09] walk into a realm though you almost were
[11:11] enraptured condition a few moments ago
[11:13] but you just start tampering with the
[11:17] realm of politics or the realm of the
[11:19] world you see it's which dog that you
[11:22] fight the most so there's lines that we
[11:28] can't cross there's lines that we must
[11:30] be careful with our nation has lines
[11:34] good bad ugly our nation has lines
[11:37] contested lines building walls that
[11:39] don't cure anything what we need to know
[11:42] fashion revival in our whole nation
[11:44] that's what we need hey man Aziz brother
[11:48] branham said he said it's it's the
[11:50] rottenness that's a manga see communism
[11:53] is going to take us over China isn't
[11:55] going to take this over it's the
[11:57] rottenness that's among us that's that's
[11:59] the real problem
[12:03] moments define us moments in our lives
[12:08] define who we are David could write
[12:11] these songs because he had met God as we
[12:14] would begin to look at last night and
[12:16] then we come to this line today you
[12:19] see Israel had been brought to a spot in
[12:21] their life to where that Satan had made
[12:25] a challenge and they come to the to a
[12:29] line to where that Israel was even
[12:32] they're either going to be the servants
[12:34] of the Philistines or the children of
[12:37] Israel was going to whip Goliath and to
[12:42] overcome him now now let me just say
[12:44] this to you it's easy when you can
[12:46] negotiate a you know a halfway and a
[12:49] compromise or negotiating sometimes
[12:52] that's what Christians do so-called they
[12:56] negotiate with the enemy and they'll
[13:00] give him a Sunday morning but they don't
[13:03] give him Monday Tuesday Wednesday saw
[13:13] was a backslidden King he was anointed
[13:16] he was chosen by the people they wanted
[13:19] a king like everybody else that he was a
[13:22] man that should have accepted the
[13:24] challenge he was a man that should have
[13:26] stepped up and said Goliath my god is
[13:30] real and he's able to take care of this
[13:32] situation but because Saul had broke the
[13:36] Word of God in his history he couldn't
[13:41] meet the devil on his grounds because
[13:44] God had rejected him and was now going
[13:48] toward another king that was coming that
[13:52] King wasn't 40 years old but he was a
[13:54] boy but that boy had had an experience
[13:57] with killing a lion and killing a bear
[14:00] and he knew God and he had been
[14:03] fellowship and God writing songs of Zion
[14:06] and the presence of God would sweep
[14:08] through his life and he knew the power
[14:11] or the inner workings of God as we've
[14:14] said many times we've said it over and
[14:18] over Goliath was in good shape as long
[14:22] as there was no David to answer
[14:27] Goliath could have stood there for years
[14:30] are you with me he can stand there for
[14:34] years in your life - in your life he can
[14:38] stand there in war with you for decades
[14:42] feeling comfortable to sit in a Pew and
[14:44] refuse it to move on let me just say
[14:48] that's a stagnant place to me and when
[14:50] you come to a spot of comfort of reality
[14:52] then I'm just I'm just said safe here
[14:55] leave me alone where I'm at I'm gonna be
[14:58] all right I need more of God today then
[15:01] I had yesterday there's a desire you
[15:05] know we have more Andrew Andrew actually
[15:19] I blended two things together
[15:21] Andrew wrote something the other day and
[15:24] then brother Tim Pruitt I send it to him
[15:26] and he put some lines in it brother
[15:28] brother Andrew I want to just share this
[15:30] with you courage be strong and of a good
[15:35] courage we're believers we're God's sons
[15:40] we fight we don't back up nor do we back
[15:47] down we thought he sheltered us shelters
[15:55] us under his wings he fights our battles
[15:58] he wins our wars we cast Satan out by
[16:02] Holy Ghost boldness
[16:03] he has authorized us and empowered us to
[16:07] use the name of Jesus for any Meade at
[16:10] any time and we believe taking him out
[16:14] of his word by authority casting him out
[16:16] reminding him of who we are we have been
[16:20] declared an invincible army never to be
[16:23] defeated
[16:26] it will be he again that wins this
[16:29] battle for the random watch team as a
[16:33] healer now we watch him as a warrior l
[16:36] Cabal if any bride is prepared if any
[16:40] people is prepared we all I don't care
[16:44] what we face yes it may hurt it may
[16:47] stink and there are future things that
[16:52] we don't know but let us say this if God
[16:57] be for us if God be for us who can be
[17:07] against us there are moments that we
[17:12] come to in our lives
[17:15] till I'd like to just take a couple of
[17:17] moments before I go for and I won't be
[17:19] real long tonight but I said as we look
[17:22] in the scriptures there were showdowns
[17:26] Abraham and lot had a so damn it defined
[17:31] the future of these two men's lives
[17:35] light did not realize he'd lose his
[17:37] family and where he was headed was
[17:41] destruction and he was tilting his
[17:45] family towards destruction to walk away
[17:48] from Christ it's the make a decision
[17:52] that destruction is in my future
[17:54] you say brother honor I can home myself
[17:58] you can't hold yourself
[17:59] I can stay pure and I can stay wholly
[18:06] without Jesus all of us are lost and
[18:09] dying on a when I rode going to hell
[18:14] Goliath is not going to be the first
[18:18] enemy to boast there's a man named
[18:21] Pharoah that made a boast and he crossed
[18:27] the line he came to alive
[18:30] and the judgments of God began to fall
[18:32] on him and he didn't realize there was a
[18:35] point to where he could have accepted
[18:38] the message of the hour and let the
[18:41] children of this will go and his nation
[18:44] still maintained the greatest nation
[18:47] that ever was on the earth but because
[18:50] he contested the messenger of the hour
[18:53] and refuted the message Flass fleas
[18:58] frogs locusts water turned to blood
[19:02] fresh sun find it incredible that God
[19:09] hardens his heart to turn against Moses
[19:13] but another showdown comes Moses is
[19:18] standing at the Red Sea two million
[19:21] people looks like they're going to come
[19:23] into a time to where that that where
[19:26] they're going to be destroyed in moments
[19:28] you're talking about laying it on the
[19:30] line you remember it comes with cost a
[19:40] lot of people are willing to do a lot of
[19:43] things as long as there's no cost
[19:52] especially when it becomes personal it's
[19:57] long it's everybody else doing the cost
[19:59] it's a free ride free riders are not
[20:03] just standing at stop signs with a sign
[20:09] in their hand I'm not throwing a stone
[20:14] at them but since I'm preaching to the
[20:17] whole world now on the internet I can
[20:20] say it more freely a lot of free riders
[20:24] sit in church
[20:28] under the umbrella of the church they
[20:30] get prayers they can fill a part of the
[20:37] community of the church they can sit in
[20:40] a Pew conform a little bit and act the
[20:43] part and it's got benefits to it let me
[20:47] just say that it's got benefits but
[20:49] that's not really laying it on the line
[20:57] ministers were assembled as they were
[21:00] assembled to have a breakfast there was
[21:03] some farm animals having a conversation
[21:07] one was a big in one was a chicken and
[21:11] the chicken was making a great boast
[21:13] that as he looked into she looked into
[21:16] the to the to the table she saw some of
[21:20] the fruit of her labor and she said look
[21:26] what I did for the kingdom of God the
[21:29] pig said that's white admire Belov you
[21:31] too to share your fruit but when they
[21:35] asked me for the ham that's on the table
[21:40] it's total commitment I'm not looking
[21:49] for your dollar in the offering plate
[21:55] I'm not a money guy I'm looking for your
[21:58] heart
[22:01] [Applause]
[22:13] when we come to this spot many people
[22:16] wrassle with a Pew when it comes all to
[22:19] cold times they were a so with that Pew
[22:21] standing in front of them knowing that
[22:23] they need to go forward knowing that
[22:26] they need to step will on with God
[22:28] knowing that they need to make the mess
[22:30] next step but the cost is the issue that
[22:38] goes with it now let me just say what
[22:44] separates the believer or the overcomer
[22:48] from others it's kind of like the
[22:50] Olympics everybody enjoys the guy that
[22:53] climbs up there and gets that gold
[22:54] around his neck and people say well I'd
[22:59] like to be like that and maybe image
[23:00] themselves as being like that but the
[23:03] difference between that guy and the god
[23:07] that sitting in this fan in the stands
[23:10] is the cost and it's been years of
[23:17] dedication and years of work
[23:21] oh brother on but I want to be in the
[23:24] bride of Jesus Christ it will take
[23:25] election of God it will take dedication
[23:28] it will take commitment you won't
[23:32] accidentally bill go to heaven
[23:35] there's rap that's gotta be done first
[23:40] of all you must give yourself to the
[23:42] world I find it's incredible great men
[23:55] can give speeches give group great will
[23:59] to quotations move audiences with
[24:02] influence inspired by inspirational
[24:07] speaking but it don't live on Monday
[24:10] morning computers and and
[24:16] and queries and Bible study programs
[24:19] message study programs has produced a
[24:22] lot of men with zeidel without a collar
[24:28] it's produced men that thought they were
[24:31] preachers and at the end of the day they
[24:33] were good Sunday school guys a lot of
[24:39] people can preach theory and theologians
[24:41] and doctors i'ma preach to you but it
[24:47] takes a Holy Ghost field ministry to
[24:51] challenge us
[25:01] I say this to you somebody's going to
[25:03] meet the challenge of this hour somebody
[25:08] is going to meet the challenge of this
[25:09] hour Romans chapter 8 in verse 28 says
[25:15] this we know that all things work
[25:18] together for the good to them that love
[25:20] God to them who were who are they called
[25:23] according to his purpose for whom he did
[25:26] foreknow so he knows your history he
[25:35] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[25:39] the image of his son that he might be
[25:40] the firstborn among men that many
[25:42] brethren moreover whom he did
[25:44] predestinate them he also called and
[25:46] whom he called them he also justified
[25:49] which is as when God knows how to wash
[25:52] you with the blood of Jesus Christ to
[25:54] where you're no longer that old man
[25:55] anymore may look like the same house
[25:59] that used to live but God lives on the
[26:02] inside of you so much tell you're no
[26:04] longer the prostitute that drug addict
[26:11] you're no longer that man whom he called
[26:18] them he also justified I like it God
[26:21] justifies it's not man justifying
[26:25] justification is as though you never did
[26:27] it in the flesh first place and whom he
[26:29] justified them he also glorified
[26:31] what should we then say to these things
[26:34] if black before us who can be against us
[26:39] and he that spared not his own son but
[26:42] delivered him up for us all how shall we
[26:44] he not with him freely give us all
[26:46] things
[26:47] everything that God owns it's given to a
[26:51] believer
[26:53] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[26:56] God's elect it is God that justifies who
[26:59] is he that condemneth it is Christ that
[27:01] not they rather that is risen again who
[27:04] is at the right hand of God who maketh
[27:06] intercession for us and upon his
[27:09] intercession we make confession that by
[27:12] His stripes we are healed
[27:14] [Applause]
[27:25] who shall separate us from the love of
[27:28] Christ shall tribulation pur sermons
[27:32] could be preached or hear or distress or
[27:35] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[27:37] peril or sword as it is written for thy
[27:40] sake we are killed all the day long and
[27:43] we're accounted as a sheep for slaughter
[27:45] they and all of these things we are more
[27:48] than conquerors through him that left us
[27:55] for I am persuaded that neither death
[27:58] nor life nor Angels nor principalities
[27:59] or powers or things for us are the
[28:02] things to come nor height nor depth nor
[28:04] any other creature shall be able to
[28:06] separate us from the love of God which
[28:08] is in Christ Jesus our Lord this was not
[28:12] written from a posh office this was
[28:19] written from a dungeon with a guard with
[28:23] chains wrapped to one another
[28:28] well he wasn't me so we must look beyond
[28:31] their circumstances Andrew said this
[28:35] last night and that this is my favorite
[28:37] scripture if you come here 10 years or
[28:40] 20 years you're going to hear it
[28:42] rectally no weapon that is formed
[28:43] against thee shall prosper and every
[28:50] tongue that thou shalt rise against thee
[28:52] and the judgment thou shall condemn
[28:55] whether on but your your preached and
[28:58] condemns me your life condemns me and I
[29:02] come against it let me just say at the
[29:04] judgment this voice this is the heritage
[29:12] of the servants of the Lord and their
[29:14] righteousness as if of the Lord
[29:17] Philippians chapter 1 in verse 6 being
[29:20] confident of this very thing stay with
[29:25] me that he which hath begun a good work
[29:28] in you will perform it until the day of
[29:34] Jesus Christ whether this is your first
[29:38] time or your thousandth and forty times
[29:41] second time you say we're brother on I
[29:44] don't know if God's pulling me what got
[29:45] you here it sure wasn't the devil that
[29:50] got you here so if God is calling out to
[29:53] your life he that started a good work
[29:59] that's the kind of God that don't start
[30:01] and quit
[30:02] that's not pulling days this and going
[30:05] he loves me he loves me not he loves me
[30:07] he loves me not you understand what I'm
[30:09] saying here sister he loves me he loves
[30:11] me not he loves me he loves me not
[30:15] told me he loved me
[30:17] [Applause]
[30:19] God told me he'd fight for me there's
[30:25] not a circumstance or a situation that
[30:28] will break that code with God
[30:33] Philippians 4 verse 13 I can do all
[30:36] things through Christ Jesus through
[30:40] Christ which strengthens me
[30:45] 1st Peter chapter 4 and verse 12 beloved
[30:48] think it not strange concerning the
[30:50] fiery trial which is to come to you as
[30:52] though some strange things happen unto
[30:55] you but rejoice in as much as ye are
[30:59] partakers of Christ's suffering that
[31:01] when his glory shall be revealed you may
[31:05] be glad with exceedingly joy ephesians
[31:09] and 6 in verse 10 finally my brethren be
[31:12] strong in the lord and in the power of
[31:14] his might put on the whole armour of God
[31:16] that you may able to be able to stand
[31:18] against the wiles of the devil for we
[31:21] wrestle not against flesh and blood and
[31:24] against principalities and against
[31:27] powers and against the rulers of the
[31:29] darkness of this world against spiritual
[31:31] wickedness in high places
[31:32] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[31:35] of God that you may be able to stand we
[31:40] stand in that evil day and having done
[31:42] all to stand what keeps us is his word
[31:55] because there will come times in your
[31:58] own energy you quit
[32:02] there'll be times that where you go I'm
[32:04] never going back I'm tired I'm done I'm
[32:06] done I'm done
[32:08] I quit but let me just remind you you're
[32:13] not holding yourself it ain't you that's
[32:20] holding on it is God that gives you the
[32:24] oxygen in your lungs I know it's me it
[32:30] is God that gives us a strength to get
[32:32] out of bed in the morning are you with
[32:36] me it is God that directs the storms
[32:39] around your lives and your homes and
[32:44] whether or not you know this is angels
[32:47] dispatched around your home your
[32:49] children your nots
[32:59] I don't know what media you that you
[33:06] have whatever news media that you have
[33:09] and you see murder and you see this and
[33:11] rape and all these different kinds of
[33:13] things and drugs and all that different
[33:14] kind of things and it tells the address
[33:16] it tells the names of those people
[33:18] rejoice your name's not on that news
[33:24] that could have been you

[33:38] angel with you when you're in your
[33:40] school there's an angel with you come on
[33:45] church your four-year little old baby
[33:47] going to school you dispatched an angel
[33:50] of God to go with you that's better than
[33:56] having an army but human beings with you
[34:11] I'm interested in different things so
[34:15] when I was looking at that scripture the
[34:16] other day I thought I wonder what people
[34:18] pay for for personal security so one of
[34:24] the Kardashians don't be angels you know
[34:27] who they are one of the conditions pays
[34:30] four hundred thousand dollars a month
[34:34] for protection that's most more a month
[34:41] and most of us make here in this church
[34:44] understand what I'm saying here I want
[34:50] to say this to you I'm better protected
[34:53] than she is I've got news for you you're
[34:57] better protected than she is
[35:10] she wants to get snapshots that's how
[35:22] she makes her money but you see if she
[35:25] really was a Christian she cover that
[35:27] baby up Muhammad Ali said cover up your
[35:32] treasures
[35:33] [Applause]

[35:43] extremely - a very temporary kings and
[35:49] potentates and greatly and fall for five
[35:52] minutes of pleasure default the devil
[36:01] made me do it

[36:06] the bank you could have told him to go
[36:08] back to where he came from a lot of
[36:17] people don't mind sitting in the pew but
[36:19] when they go home they can't overcome
[36:20] cost you gotta use your tongue and your
[36:24] porn ur finger and tell the devil go

[38:17] gotta walk out of that room for the

[39:02] language quit doing pot that's right

[40:04] laying it all on the line here

[40:12] interesting that there are no miracles
[40:14] without a mess first first of all your
[40:21] salvation you were a mess there are no
[40:27] goody two-shoes that walks into the
[40:32] kingdom of God ah that sinned and come
[40:35] short of the glory of God whether or not
[40:40] from a certain family could care less
[40:42] about certain family found Church God is
[40:52] no respecter of persons it doesn't make
[40:55] any difference if your name is Brigham
[40:57] Peter James or John you have a history
[41:00] of being a stinker and without Jesus you
[41:03] still off
[41:07] [Applause]
[41:21] we all rejoice about Sarah having a baby
[41:25] and turning young again in the
[41:26] scriptures and a king lusting after her
[41:29] she became one of the most beautiful
[41:32] women in all of Israel history but she
[41:36] suffered 90 years of humiliating
[41:39] woundedness I believe in that she wasn't
[41:45] good enough help me preach now if you
[41:49] can ever come to a spot to where you
[41:51] realize who you are and how important
[41:53] you are and the kingdom of God you treat
[41:56] yourself different you remember this
[42:00] that God did not just visit Abraham
[42:04] alone but he came to Sarah as well
[42:07] [Applause]
[42:13] sometimes when we get older come to a
[42:16] spot to where that we think about our
[42:19] age deteriorating our minds
[42:21] deteriorating our sight deteriorating
[42:23] our muscles deteriorating it's all part
[42:26] of the human anatomy of Adams Falls but
[42:31] one of the greatest men was Isaac and he
[42:33] came to a spot in his life to word that
[42:35] he couldn't lead himself across the room
[42:37] because he became blind and God had a
[42:40] purpose in that because he had two sons
[42:44] from their womb God chose Jacob and
[42:51] hated Esau you see you couldn't choose
[42:56] yourself God chose you but if you two
[43:01] looked at the true picture of humanity
[43:03] you were to pick diesel he was a better
[43:07] boy
[43:09] he was a religious man he did more
[43:12] things for his mom his daddy he'll he
[43:15] was he had great respect to honor to his
[43:18] father but he did not honor the
[43:20] birthright his brother was a rascal
[43:23] there's a lot of things that we can lay
[43:25] on Jacob
[43:25] there was a lot of things but God loved
[43:28] Jacob and to get Jacob the blessing
[43:33] Isaac had to walk around and blindness a
[43:36] whole lot no miracles without a mess a
[43:46] widow and her son had to starve they had
[43:55] to starve and come to the point of death
[44:00] to where there was only what we might
[44:03] say a half a mil left and she was going
[44:08] to give it to her son and then they were
[44:11] going to commit to die oh the whole
[44:13] nation was done it wasn't just her 9 the
[44:18] whole nation was done but there was a
[44:20] prophet that was coming with unlimited
[44:23] power but before she could have a meal
[44:29] barrel that would never run dry and a
[44:31] cruse of all that would never run ground
[44:33] she had to come to the point of
[44:35] starvation and then she had to be
[44:39] willing to pay the cost baking a cake
[44:51] the moon shares this with us he said now
[44:53] the Hebrew children who were going
[44:54] through their trial he said that was
[44:57] right up at the last moment and they was
[44:59] just ready to step into the furnace you
[45:01] know what sometimes we watch things
[45:04] going on here on earth but there's
[45:07] something going on in heaven all that
[45:09] the same time are you with man
[45:13] there's something going on in heaven at
[45:16] the same time do you mean while it's
[45:19] going on here on earth God's making
[45:20] provision oh you will make this more
[45:27] real for you in just a few minutes
[45:29] sometimes we watch things going on here
[45:31] but there's something going on in heaven
[45:33] the same time we may not be able to see
[45:35] it but it's going on anyhow
[45:36] pardon me let's turn our camera towards
[45:39] heaven now I can see Jesus said it on
[45:42] the throne coming daylight smokes
[45:44] raising up in the skies from the furnace
[45:46] and I see him sitting there watching
[45:48] down and what are they going to do
[45:49] that's what he does when you and I get
[45:52] tried the promise he made hiss he
[45:55] promised that the seed of Abraham would
[45:58] possess the gate of the enemy I believe
[46:03] that I see him watching and all at once
[46:05] the great angel comes to his right side
[46:07] and stands to his attention and puts his
[46:09] hand on his sword and said he said
[46:11] Gabriel he said father have you looked
[46:14] down there there's the seed of Abraham
[46:16] they believe in you they have prayed all
[46:20] night they're going right into their
[46:22] death let me go down there
[46:25] and I'll change the scene I believe that
[46:28] he could have got it done that's right
[46:32] Gabriel you're a good angel now you just
[46:34] stand there
[46:35] here comes another one his name is
[46:37] wormwood he sea angel over all the
[46:39] waters and I can see him stand at
[46:41] attention he said father have you looked
[46:43] down what's going on in Babylon he said
[46:46] yes I've watched him all night long his
[46:48] eyes on the sparrow and I know he
[46:50] watches me I've watched them all night
[46:53] long they're fixing to burn those three
[46:55] men down there in the morning they're
[46:56] seeds of Abraham that took you by your
[46:59] word they're standing gallon do you know
[47:01] one time you told me to loose the waters
[47:04] and I have control you let me go down
[47:06] there and I'll wash babblin off of the
[47:08] map
[47:10] he could have done it and I can hear him
[47:15] say that's right one word you wonderful
[47:18] angel you did just exactly everything
[47:21] that I told you since you were created I
[47:23] created you but you know I'm going down
[47:29] there myself this is my job and when
[47:42] they were getting ready to take their
[47:43] last step I could see him stand up with
[47:45] his priestly robes drop around him and
[47:48] he's sitting tonight they're bloody
[47:49] making intercession upon our confession
[47:52] for he died that bring to pass anything
[47:54] that we ask where our faith is in him
[47:57] there he stands in motions this way and
[47:59] here comes this big white cloud coming
[48:01] by and he steps on it and he calls the
[48:04] east and the north and the south and the
[48:06] west wind to drive them like horses and
[48:11] crack it across the skies like a cigs AG
[48:14] wagon before they could ever step in
[48:17] there he was standing there because of
[48:26] Adams fall where he crossed the line God
[48:33] made a way of escape
[48:36] the call Senatus fall a man is born a
[48:39] woman in few days in full of troubles
[48:41] oh brother on but I'll become a
[48:43] Christian and everything will go good
[48:45] you gotta fight to have a good marriage
[48:51] you gotta fight every day of your life
[48:53] to overcome God provided you the armor
[48:58] and the word with infinite power but
[49:02] don't take your focus off of Jesus cross
[49:07] [Music]
[49:11] where does God meet us in a trial none
[49:20] of us likes to go there but God makes a
[49:25] way of escape before we ever get there
[49:37] Jesus never cried when they brought the
[49:39] maniac bow to him they had epilepsy
[49:42] failing
[49:43] falling into fire he never said father
[49:45] I'm your son and now you sent me here to
[49:50] do so and so can I heal this boy he
[49:53] never said that he simply said come out
[49:57] of him Satan and he spoke and the boy
[50:01] was well when he met Legion with two
[50:05] thousand Devils in him it wasn't Jesus a
[50:07] crime it was the devils that were crying
[50:13] suffer us to go under that hurt us Wan
[50:17] God knows who's the most powerful so why
[50:23] does he tempt you he's wanting to get
[50:25] your power
[50:27] what do you have that he don't have now
[50:33] let's just think about it for a moment
[50:35] what do you have that he don't have he
[50:46] owns the kingdoms of the world Whitney
[50:51] what do you have that he don't have how
[50:53] old are you Whitney 20 you're 20 years
[51:00] old this is a devil of a war with you
[51:05] you ever battle in your mind you have a
[51:09] do you on a house so we don't want that
[51:13] do you own the mercedes-benz you own
[51:17] your car that's nice you have a
[51:25] million-dollar ring so those are things
[51:30] that
[51:37] see he's got Marilyn Monroe he's got
[51:44] Hollywood
[51:46] he's got kings and governors and
[51:48] potentates he's got all the advertisers
[51:51] so why would he be fighting you you must
[51:55] possess something that is a hidden power
[52:01] that he don't have
[52:03] [Applause]
[52:14] hallelujah
[52:15] [Applause]
[52:37] why does he fight me so much cause I'm
[52:40] something that is eternal life that's
[52:46] got power over every devil inhale oh
[52:51] gods give it to me
[53:14] so why didn't why does he continue to
[53:17] fight brother branham though he's been
[53:19] dead over fifty years
[53:27] let's just not just brother branham why
[53:30] does he fight Jesus and they say he
[53:32] never existed when he knows that Jesus
[53:35] showed up in his house he now said Jesus
[53:41] came into his place and took the keys of
[53:44] death hell and the grave and he knows
[53:46] that he don't even know that they even
[53:48] the stranger of death he knows that he
[53:53] knows he knows
[54:07] oh yeah
[54:08] [Applause]
[54:21] but the random winning priest to seven
[54:23] seals after he met an angel of the Lord
[54:28] you can fuss and fight over that but the
[54:31] seven seals were revealed and the
[54:34] thunders were revealed and Satan is
[54:36] fighting us because we got him it's ash
[54:41] we believe it we don't have to fight
[54:43] over it no more
[54:44] it's ours the mystery is revealed it's
[54:46] inside of us now it's a book of life
[54:48] were the people of the open book it's
[54:51] ours we are possessors of it and so
[54:53] therefore Satan knows that the last
[54:55] attack against the bride of Jesus Christ
[55:08] the brother branham would come down to
[55:10] certain spots and he would say certain
[55:16] things and knowing that he's standing in
[55:19] two different worlds at the same time
[55:21] but not only was God there but the enemy
[55:24] was there and was a great contest and
[55:28] sometimes as as a prophet he had to lay
[55:31] it all on the line he could lay it all
[55:35] on the line because Jesus was living in
[55:38] him and he had laid it all on the line
[55:42] because Jesus was in the garden and he
[55:45] said father if it be thy will let this
[55:48] cup pass from me nevertheless not my
[55:52] will but thy will be done he would turn
[55:55] to his disciples said let not your heart
[55:57] be troubled
[55:58] now speaking into world's that not your
[56:00] heart be troubled you believe in God
[56:02] believe also in me
[56:03] in my father's house are many mansions
[56:05] he was not talking about brick and
[56:07] mortar and stone he was talking about
[56:09] you got a new body waiting over there
[56:10] for you and Paul would say behold I show
[56:14] you a mystery
[56:15] flesh and blood shall not inherit the
[56:17] kingdom of God John the Revelator be
[56:21] certainly safe but behold
[56:23] and of God are you with me the the
[56:27] tabernacle of God were you and I will
[56:29] dwell together behold I see a new heaven
[56:32] and a new earth for the first Earth and
[56:36] the first heaven there passed away come
[56:50] to some certain points to where that
[56:55] little Finland boy was laying there two
[56:57] years the vision was it was laying there
[57:02] and his bones were out of he's actually
[57:05] tore through his clothes and brother man
[57:08] recognized the recognized him don't know
[57:10] it but after a bit he begins to realize
[57:12] this is the vision am I gonna go into
[57:15] great details but brother Brown said he
[57:17] walks up there and he said if this
[57:19] little boy is not on the ground off of
[57:21] the ground in five minutes you call me a
[57:23] false prophet you talking about laying
[57:26] it all on the line every sermon ever
[57:32] discernment every overcoming everything
[57:36] you're laying it all on the line if he's
[57:39] not off of the ground in five minutes
[57:40] you call me a false prophet but the
[57:47] member steps out behind the pulpit one
[57:48] night and he says if I'm not telling you

[1:00:01] contest and goliath wanted to walk in
[1:00:04] the field and him against to make his
[1:00:08] boast that first of all we need to draw
[1:00:10] some lines let's just draw some lines
[1:00:15] here I want to remind God I want to
[1:00:19] remind Goliath I want to remind the
[1:00:21] devil whose side I'm on
[1:00:24] if we gotta fight this battle I wanna
[1:00:27] kill him whose side I'm on and I want to
[1:00:32] remind him that they told me I'd never
[1:00:34] walk again after falling 40 feet and
[1:00:36] landing on concrete and ever vertebra
[1:00:39] was both broken but God raised me back
[1:00:42] up that not
[1:00:44] [Applause]
[1:00:59] strokes heart issues blood pressure
[1:01:05] since it was eighteen-years-old
[1:01:08] burning in the fire so let's just bring
[1:01:15] that up just for a moment you see it was
[1:01:22] on the day that the doctors gave me up
[1:01:28] and I was laying in a coma that God
[1:01:34] dealt with brother Bisco you're from
[1:01:38] brother bisko's and I told them last
[1:01:41] week what you there or not there why
[1:01:45] wouldn't you be there I came to your
[1:01:47] place but you can't be here and there at
[1:01:49] the same time as well you're here and
[1:01:53] I've been accused of being a brother
[1:01:56] fiscal supporter well I don't I'm not
[1:02:01] ashamed of that what or so ever so I'm
[1:02:08] just gonna give you why where I stand at
[1:02:10] Bisco who had been a mentor he had been
[1:02:16] an example whom I preached convention
[1:02:20] after convention with and more than I
[1:02:23] can even remember I've stood in the
[1:02:24] pulpits with him and watched him preach
[1:02:26] and heard the stories all being exactly
[1:02:28] right when I was in that coma
[1:02:33] on that day God speaks to him early in
[1:02:38] the morning to call sister Connie who
[1:02:40] was sitting on a platform tonight and
[1:02:43] you can stand and God speaks to brother
[1:02:48] best go to call sister Connie and he
[1:02:53] begins to talk to her and he and he
[1:02:56] begins to talk to her about the
[1:02:57] situation and he says it is the last
[1:03:02] thing to go with the hearing so I want
[1:03:05] you to whisper and
[1:03:06] the runs years that we have blocked
[1:03:08] Mount Baker Bible Way camp and God has
[1:03:13] spoke to me that he will be the speaker
[1:03:17] at camp next year
[1:03:34] did it happen
[1:03:39] sister Katie would you stand that's the
[1:03:44] first time that she ever screamed in a
[1:03:46] church and she was screaming in the
[1:03:49] audience and brother Tom Bray said does
[1:03:52] she do that every service I said never
[1:03:54] heard him do that before brother Andrew
[1:03:57] will you stand and Andrew was a good boy
[1:04:01] and he was my son but he needed the Holy
[1:04:04] Ghost and standing in Victoria God gave
[1:04:08] him on the street the baptism of the
[1:04:10] Holy Ghost he came home a different
[1:04:13] person
[1:04:14] [Applause]
[1:04:25] I'm saying this in the great big scope
[1:04:27] of things God don't just have me on his
[1:04:29] mind in a time like this those moments
[1:04:38] are a critical importance
[1:04:40] sowho acid that told air disco to call
[1:04:43] me why you left me who was it I told
[1:04:57] this story at Ray Erickson's until this
[1:04:59] very story at Ray artisans and a
[1:05:02] preacher who made a video against the
[1:05:04] message contested me after the service
[1:05:07] and put his nose right here
[1:05:10] listen it's a bad thing to put your nose
[1:05:14] that close to me Matthew calls me a
[1:05:19] honey badger brother Nathaniel you know
[1:05:30] 100% sure I'll fight for you I am made
[1:05:34] of fighting material when I got finished
[1:05:45] he wanted to leave the room he wanted to
[1:05:48] leave the room swiftly I said just a
[1:05:51] moment just a moment just in case this
[1:05:55] video gets to him he knows this is the
[1:05:56] truth cuz it'll get to him it'll get to
[1:06:01] him but he knows like the devil knows I
[1:06:06] said just a minute you be a man you
[1:06:09] walked into this office uninvited you
[1:06:13] took me on night I took you off you took
[1:06:17] me on now we're gonna walk out of this

[1:06:23] through one doors then through another
[1:06:24] door there's gonna be about six or seven
[1:06:26] preachers standing there and a
[1:06:27] photographer is gonna take our pictures
[1:06:29] he said how do you know
[1:06:35] how do you know the same voice that give
[1:06:39] me the sermon today told me that's
[1:06:41] what's going to happen and we walk
[1:06:43] through the door and we walk through the
[1:06:44] other door and there they all stand and
[1:06:47] he looked at me I said now you be a man
[1:06:49] and stand here beside a man sometimes
[1:06:58] you got to lay it all on the line this
[1:07:02] message is right it's not negotiable
[1:07:36] you'd be seated behind oh Carlos you're
[1:07:43] here tonight this will only means
[1:07:46] something to you but it was working at
[1:07:50] your place at another facility you
[1:07:52] wasn't there and that Matthew looked at
[1:07:55] me and said what's wrong dad
[1:07:57] I said I can't tell you right now and he
[1:08:01] kept going what's wrong dad there's
[1:08:03] already what's wrong and I said he's
[1:08:11] here and whenever he comes he's here to
[1:08:15] do a job gains of the Lord came into
[1:08:19] that trouble they're gonna talk to him
[1:08:22] you see he's concerned about your
[1:08:23] everyday part of life
[1:08:32] so I when we get done we have lunch with
[1:08:38] Connie at Cracker Barrel and Andrew
[1:08:41] sends me and I speak to a special man
[1:08:44] that no and he had a real big burden and
[1:08:49] he had a real big situation and he
[1:08:52] looked at me and he said I need help and
[1:08:54] I said interesting God came by and gave
[1:08:56] me the answer are you willing to hear it
[1:09:00] and I said you need to get rid of this
[1:09:03] person and you need get rid of that
[1:09:04] person you need to get rid of this
[1:09:05] person you need to get rid of that
[1:09:07] person because they're trying to destroy
[1:09:09] your company and Carlos I told him to
[1:09:19] keep you ain't saying this for the good
[1:09:25] of any human being here tonight but God
[1:09:28] watches over our footsteps are you with
[1:09:33] me here's a man on the brink of
[1:09:35] bankruptcy and when you got God on your
[1:09:38] side you can't lose
[1:09:40] I learned it brother Tim heard that I
[1:09:48] was going to come to this point so I'm
[1:09:50] coming to it now you see when God
[1:09:54] prepares a battle he starts getting
[1:09:58] ready but the temperate came here 12
[1:10:03] years ago while I was laying in the coma
[1:10:07] on the days to where that they took me
[1:10:10] off of the ventilator and then I was
[1:10:12] brain dead for 36 hours or
[1:10:18] non-responsive let me put it right
[1:10:20] non-responsive sister Connie's still
[1:10:22] thinks I'm brain dead at times
[1:10:26] and brother temperate preaches to you
[1:10:28] words of prophecy one words one sermon
[1:10:32] was God will have a testimony now it's
[1:10:41] easy to look back 12 years ago well
[1:10:43] that's easy sermon for him to preach
[1:10:44] because God had a testimony but when
[1:10:47] you're standing in the fire and God
[1:10:54] speaking to you and your best buddy is
[1:10:57] in the is give up and you walk to an
[1:11:04] audience that shell-shocked and you tell
[1:11:07] that audience what God's told you to
[1:11:08] preach to them God will have a testimony
[1:11:16] Hemi was here that night
[1:11:20] well if God's ever been with you he'll
[1:11:23] never leave you brother Tim brewer was
[1:11:30] in Israel on a trip because of Isaac was
[1:11:33] more than fulfilling a vision and he
[1:11:36] walked down in a brook to where David
[1:11:39] picked up stones and when he reached
[1:11:46] down he picked up five stones for
[1:11:48] himself and five stones for me five
[1:12:01] smooth stones then our great big stones
[1:12:05] but you don't need a great big stone
[1:12:15] don't get done before I get no mother
[1:12:20] Kelly Hildebrandt was standing here and
[1:12:23] you witnessed because when I preach for
[1:12:26] him he had a coin laying on his desk and
[1:12:28] it was a coin to where you could only
[1:12:31] get one of them as a citizen you could
[1:12:33] only get one and I liked that car I'm
[1:12:37] beyond the way I like that going I
[1:12:39] looked at it I looked at it I taught it
[1:12:42] I thought about because that coin is
[1:12:51] Normandy and Canadians had committed
[1:12:57] troops it came at great cost they lost
[1:13:00] more men than any other nation did at
[1:13:03] that matter some of us lost family
[1:13:08] members in that battle give me a name
[1:13:14] max max said here for many years he was
[1:13:20] a ruffler he was a rough codger
[1:13:21] he came to the Lord and he lost his mind
[1:13:25] but he came to a spot one time he was
[1:13:27] coming up here and setting on platform
[1:13:28] he tell me said brother Ron I love you I
[1:13:30] preached on predestination how God
[1:13:32] watched over your life even when you
[1:13:34] wasn't in control and when you went in a
[1:13:35] Christian even when you were at war he
[1:13:39] was watching over you and he said when I
[1:13:41] ran the beach at Normandy he said I
[1:13:44] jumped off the boat and I was still
[1:13:45] alive I got in that bloody water and I
[1:13:48] was still alive I ran all the way the
[1:13:50] beach and I was still arrived I ran all
[1:13:52] the way to the wall and I was still
[1:13:54] allowed and he said not until I said in
[1:13:57] this church till I realized why I was
[1:13:59] still alive
[1:14:09] [Music]

[1:14:19] sand from Normandy on it and it's got to
[1:14:26] say it that I say right to nut we that
