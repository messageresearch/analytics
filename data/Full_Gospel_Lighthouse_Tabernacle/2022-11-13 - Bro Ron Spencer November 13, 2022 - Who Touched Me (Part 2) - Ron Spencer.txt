we're we're thankful for what God is doing and uh I want to read a quote to you before we get started and I was thinking of of Johnny coming to the Lord and these last seed coming in brother Branham said uh he said he's talking about the world wars he said it stopped on the November the 11th which we have just experienced this week he said at 11 o'clock in the day an 11th month in the 11th day in the in the month in the 11th Hour in the day you remember what Jesus said about that one went into the in the vineyard to work at one time and one got a penny and the next one went and them was the 11th Hour people was was that right they there they are the 11th Hour people it's been held back now it's getting to a time for them to come in and they are gathering out there of those Jews for a nation they were scattered all over the world way down in Iran different places where they've never ever knowed that Jesus was on the earth never know nothing about a new testament or anything and now you can look and look magazine and life and them showing the pictures of them returning back didn't Jesus say it when you see the Fig Tree putting forth its buds Jews has always been the Fig Tree this generation shall not pass until all things be fulfilled God made the promise God will keep his promise I read this to you a couple of weeks ago and I want to just kind of pick up where I left off and take from last night and and it was quite a statement when I got it I've given God a million reasons not to love me and none of them changed his mind isn't that isn't that nice yeah isn't that nice amen if you'll turn with me to to Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9. I want to speak to you on I find no falling in him and I want to talk to you a little bit about our flaws Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9. and after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors what a statement forgive us our debts a man that would never have a sin in his life would pray would put this in his prayer and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen amen maybe you have a need on your heart this morning you just like say Lord would you remember me amen I too Lord Jesus we love you today and we're thankful to be in this service already filling your presence I ask you that you would touch our hearts Lord minister to us in a supernatural way each person that is here there's many that have been out sick because of different reasons of the bug that has happened to them I ask you that you touched them today strengthen them in a special way Lord you know what we have even this week in each and every one of our Lives I ask you that you would give us words that would give us strength for the journey that lays just ahead speak to us in a special way we pray amen and amen and amen you can be seated brother Brandon would say it like this he said that's the way it is today we guilty unworthy should die we're not worthy of living we're not worthy to come to Christ we're not worthy to ask anything but God never looks at our unworthiness well yeah and that'll take us a deep breath he looks at the lamb and now he can't find no fault in Christ then you're free so why are you beating yourself up all the time now if he can't find no fault in Christ then you're free he died in your Stead now if there's any fault in him you're not free yet but God don't examine you he examines the lamb Give the Lord a good hand right there hey Hallelujah [Applause] in the New Testament no matter what's wrong with you don't you look at yourself look at your lamb can you find any fault in him God don't look at you he looks at your lamb so if there is no fault in the lamb then there's no fault in you Hallelujah are you getting it now huh we're not Catholics here and we're not a rehab house are you with me we're not a law Transformation Center we're transformed by the blood of Jesus Christ it's his lamb it's his life that he's poured back inside of us now he says any son it's the attributes of his father and just as you were the genes of your father in the body of your father when you was young and you were in him yet he could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you but then through the betting ground of your mother you were brought forth into the Earth and become in the image of your father and then he could have fellowship with you and so were you sons of God and Daughters of God before there was ever a moon a star or a molecule oh you were the sons of God for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that were in God before the beginning Hallelujah for there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when you were in your Earthly father but you were manifested in His image and in the image of God you are made and you were manifested for the glory and The Fellowship Of God and therefore as you as you as you are in the gene you had to be in your father before in your natural birth your your spiritual Gene had to be in God because you're the expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundations of the world right No Way Around It oh brother on I found God no no no no no God found you you wasn't thinking of God God came thinking of you he knew what day hour that you'd be born what messages you would be under you just didn't stagger into a mission house somewhere another and all of a sudden walk to an altar God ordained your life for the footsteps of the righteous or ordered of the Lord and if you can remember if God protected your natural seed for you to get here that you would be a certain hair color certain eye color a certain physical attributes even in your complexities even in your flaws God knew what you would be he knew what your weaknesses would be he knew what your flaws would be but he proprieted a lamb that would take care of your flaws all right if you'll remember brother random explains that he would try to explain it like a drop of ink if you could drop it into a drop into into bleach and and if you drop that drop of ink into bleach it will so break it up until it would become bleach itself and then he drops our sins into the blood of Jesus Christ now under the blood of the of the goats and and and bullets you you only covered the sin but under the blood of Jesus Christ it annihilated sin to the point the god that made the sun moon and stars would not ever remember that against you ever again [Applause] now brother random would make this statement and I think it's pivotal this drop of ink now it was for a purpose that color become that color for a purpose that one drop of ink now notice these next words that one drop of ink can sign your death warrant and sends you to an electric chair quite a statement in it or that one drop of ink can pardon you from your sins you heard me say this a couple of weeks ago for us Believers we're as close to hell as we'll ever be so don't let Satan torment you don't let Satan torment you just relax you're in the hands of God and God don't lose one he's not a businessman where he loses one so the accuser that gets in your ear I want to just give you the theme right up front the accuser that gets in your ear and reminds you of all the things that you used to do and the memories of all the things that you used to do you're not guilty of that no more [Music] [Applause] you're not guilty of that no more and it may seem so real and so vivid in your memory and so vivid in your conscience and it may so seem so so so real that it's so haunting you almost live in a haunted house but what if you just turn on the devil just a little bit and say God Justified me and it's as though I never did it in the first place [Applause] Fanny Crosby lived with a flaw in her DNA she was blind now I wanted to share this with you a flaw will either destroy you or it'll drive you and being blind never see in the light of day God had a gift in her life that she would write music and be one of the greatest writers that would ever be but she never let the flaw get in in the way of the gift Moses would be one of the writers of the Old Testament but there was things that he had to write about himself that were flaws in his life murderer temper striking the rock twice are you with me and if God knows you before in the beginning before there was ever a molecule that was created and he knows you as Eternal and he knows that you're going to come on the earth in a fallen nature I'm going to preach to you he knows you're going to come in a fallen nature and he knows your faults and he knows your fears and he knows the flaws in your life God rich in Mercy provides a way to get you through all of those flaws Moses when he comes to the end he stands on the mountain weeping because he's not going to get to go through into the Promised Land and God allows him to look over the mountain an angel pallbearers takes him home but the devil had a railing accusation in Jude had a railing accusation against Moses The Sinner but God overrode his thoughts and would not let Satan have his body and sent angel pallbearers to Bear him home and then the next time he's seen he's seen on the Mount of transformation with Jesus Hallelujah pilate is standing before Jesus and pilate saith unto him what is truth and when he had said this he went again unto the Jews and saith unto them I find in him no fault at all now what you think about this the enemy that's how many of you before we get started you're too good how many of you have that accuser in your ear oh I'm preaching the right group yeah because I do I too have that accuser in my ear so we're preaching to him this morning so one day the guy that's accusing us the one day the guy that's whispering in our ear well what they don't love you they don't care for you Jesus don't love you you're not a Christian point out your thoughts in your failures it's constantly in your ear because he's doing his job one day that same accuser because of our lamb we'll have to say Satan listen up he'll have to say it I find no fault in The Bride of Jesus Christ she's without spider Emma I couldn't produce a wife like that I can produce a denominational system that I couldn't produce a Ruth I couldn't produce her I couldn't redeem her you heard it last week I couldn't redeem her but Jesus can produce a life like this [Applause] now if you've got a way you say ups and downs and ups and downs I would advise you to go to God and stay there until you're really born again when trials and troubles and heartaches and disappointment sets in something holds you we're all going to have them it's not you holding it's something holding you it isn't a question whether I hold on or not it's a question he held on or not it isn't looking at me it's looking at him because he was the one if a man came here not a man came here a lot long ago said brother Branham I'm not worthy to be saved and he said no you're not he started weeping he said I've tried since in 1940 to get saved but I find myself not worthy brother Branham says you never will be worthy he said then I could never be saved he said oh no it isn't you it's him God don't look at you I'm God don't look at you he looks at him and if he can find fault in him then you can't be saved but if there's no thought in him then you're all right the blemish that you find in him is on you but if there's no blemish in you in him then there's no blemish on you so then we can repeat it like God Jesus repeated I came from God and I'm going back to God [Music] now the devil does not want you to get this Revelation this morning he doesn't I want you to quit beating on yourself there's a thing called self-sabotage I'm not going to get into it but a lot of times when we're on a diet right before Thanksgiving the things that you can't have you crave the most your water goes out you're so thirsty for water you wasn't thirsty before the spicket quit but now you're thirsty for water you you went on a diet and you have you have promised I'm not going to eat any sugar today and you go right by Krispy Kreme and the hot sign is on you know what the devil will do to you because he knows that you have crossed the barrier so you'll go into a restaurant and that old time rock and roll the kind of music that just soothes the soul I was a Bob Seger fan I can sing them songs all of a sudden you're sitting at a table and your foot's going you're having a spiritual conversation your foot's going Satan's trying to trap you and he's the kind of guy that will talk something and then call the police and then he'll tell you you're just uh you're you're just horrible he'll make your temper fly up I know nobody's in this building's got a problem you husbands and wives live a perfect life and you can go on the job work eight ten hours come home and he'll stir a little friction in the house and your wife or your husband knows exactly where the panic button is Boo he walks out the door says job accomplished and you're two perfectly good Christians Zach Mary y'all y'all are angels I know you are you just got married haven't had an issue probably whatsoever none none none none well look whatsoever wait you can go to bed feeling like you're in raptured condition and have a dream I woke up one morning sister Connie woke me up to go to work back when in the Arsenal days when I was working on at the Arsenal and I woke up I walked into the kitchen I said good morning baby you know what you did to me don't you call me baby [Applause] she said when she woke me up I shook my fist in her face I've never hit her in her life I'm not guilty she remembers it to this day have I got you on the same page now we come to church sometimes almost in the Blues because we've been beat around all week long and we leave on Sunday morning and we go wow we could have Rapture this week and Monday comes but if we can only turn it on him if we could just turn it on him and say hey wait a minute Falcons sir wait a minute I know you're trying to do your job I know you're trying to do your job and you're good at your job but I am worthy by the blood of Jesus Christ I'm more than a conqueror through the blood of Jesus Christ I'm a mighty warrior through the blood of Jesus Christ there's no blemish that is against me God holds nothing nothing against me [Applause] now when the sin of the when that sin of that mortal is confessed and dropped into the Clorox the bleach of Jesus Christ it bleaches all sin he is purely unadulterated without sin and without thought do you know how quickly that can happen seconds seconds then why should we throw a rock at somebody sitting in our same church that's going to be sitting at the table or or your wife or your husband or your children then You Know The Enemy that that causes you to pick up that rock and Jesus got on the ground and he wrote on the ground and they had they had right by law to Stone her and he wrote on the ground he that is without sin because they didn't have a lamb he that is without sin cast the first stone they had a they had they had turtle doves and they had sacrifices that only covered the sin but they still had the desire to sin Jesus knew their thoughts but he was getting ready to forgive her of her sins notice the words that he says woman where is thine accusers and she said I have none and he said neither neither do I think about that let's go to Jesus's church for a moment you think they didn't have flaws okay one of your head preachers one of your head preachers has took a sword and cut a man's ear off he's used Blasphemous names he's been found naked cursing and this is the guy that's going to preach repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the Eternal prescription but under the flaw there's a lot of bad things that is held against him and it must blow Satan's mind that God can take Peter from this position cursing abominable things naked High temporary supposedly on his way to be in a murderer and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost God places his life inside of him and now he becomes the spokesman of the church foreign Jesus finds himself in a position to word that he has to go send his disciples away because they would not understand a predestinated seed can be inside of mud and so he sends them away and he goes by Samaria Samaria was a place where that had bad names and this was a woman that had five husbands and was living with another man whatever she couldn't come at other times brother Branham will tell this story hundreds times hundreds of times I don't know if you've seen the chosen series how they did it but I think they did a really good job with it if you haven't seen that go go watch that especially that woman at the well scene it's phenomenal they capture it and he sat in there and he said I want a drink and she's looking for a messiah but in her condition the church don't want her the church don't want her but God's going to use her as a testimony it's going to use her as a testimony and there's not a doubt in my mind that the accuser that was in her ear that's in your ear reminded her though she was looking for a messiah you'll never get him but it wasn't she would find the Messiah the Messiah found her [Applause] sister Catherine you walked up here last week an incredible need you'd been to doctors but there was a doctor came to you and he changed the whole seems the whole outlook on things what a difference one day can make in a life one day you've got cancer next day you don't I'm going tomorrow I'm I'm looking for a report I'm hoping for a report that Ron you don't have cancer no more that's what I'm looking for why not believe it why not believe it people say well you you don't look like you have four stage cancer you're right it's just riding like an Uber car it's just riding one of these days it won't be able to ride no more it's your spot to get off [Applause] and Jesus he talks to her a bit and he announces to her that he is the Messiah he's not announced that to no other man that I'm the Messiah because she had a seed that had an eternal Realm now the Accuser and no doubt future accusers would say look who's in his church but because of him she was pure as a lily because of him you're as pure as a lily foreign Jesus got in a boat after a meeting crossed the waters come to see got off of the boat walked into a graveyard and there was a man there had been there he was completely away from society to where that he wasn't trusted he was in Chains none of us would want him in church if you're saying in your mind this guy was put out of society he wasn't welcome at home he wasn't welcome at his family he definitely wasn't welcome at church he wasn't welcome in the community but Jesus went to him and the demons cried out of him because he was the perfect lamb and they identified who he was and sometimes that's what the devil does to you because they can see the light on the inside of you and so immediately they'll feel condemned around you they'll quit cussing they'll quit doing different kind of things they'll quit showing you all different kind of stuff because of the life that lays on inside of you and you may have never said a word to them you represent something more than a church this ain't about this church on this hill it's about him [Applause] when Jesus left this man Jesus cast out those demons into Hawks and those Hogs had more sense than most people and they jumped off of a cliff and then people got mad because they lost their Hogs they should have been rejoicing this man is that is sane and by clothed and in his right mind but big people get I'm following me now people get mad because you don't go to their parties no more they want the old you back but they all use dead [Applause] the old use not coming back I'm sorry I'm not that guy that used to live here I look like him I I walk like him I I talk like him but the new guy that lives on the inside of me has a new king but I knew you went yeah yeah you did you did but even my accuser since I find no fault I want to I want to bring you to a point brother Branham is going to be the church age messenger that will do something that nobody else has been able to do to give us the seals the church ages and represent Christ in this age brother baranum is born in a family that has to change its name two seven letters because they're on the run from the law and brother branham's Daddy they were they were Catholics and they made moonshine I'm not going to ask you but um a lot a lot of you've moved in here I want you to understand we're not a bunch of angels here a great number of our families came from bootleg families mine included came from bootleg families but God knew we don't have a wing hang up here where do you hang your wings up before church and then pick them up afterwards we all were sinners and their sins passed down on us brother Branham was carrying water to his daddy's Steel as a little boy and a whirlwind got in that that tree and told him to never drink or Never Smoke I gotta work for you to do brother Brown dropped the bucket and ran into the house and many of them called him a nervous child no doubting Corey he carried a lot of more buckets of water to that steel but he never drank or he never smoked he would try but he would hear that Whirlwind again remember he had a little darling girl that he really liked and it come out of the building and she had a cigarette in her mouth and he walked home let me just say this to you brother Branham the man if God would have let him because of his past he would have been a murderer listen he would have killed those boys he'd have took that rifle and killed those boys and you know by history brother Branham was an incredible shot he was a phenomenal shot he would have killed him but God had to overlook the flaw he had to override the flaw cause he had a fix for the flaw this was the man that's going to fellowship with the angel of the Lord he's going to see him move in the building night after night after night he's going to see him appearing in motel rooms gonna see him appear in a cave for the first time and then throughout his life he would have fellowship with that angel that would bring us this message listen when you read a book or you listen to a tape that's more than the mind of William Branham that's more than just his thoughts even in his good opinions no brother Branham was not God but a fellowship with the angels of God people want to point out his flaws ain't no problem to me I knew them things when I was a kid but if you take that same microscope and point it back at yourself point it back at yourself you can get on Google and find bad things about me I have no doubt but let me just say this to you I'm identified [Applause] I'm identified with this lamb I'm proud to be identified with this message [Applause] when that camera can you put the camera on me right here you may already have it I'm not ashamed that what I preach here that flag is hanging behind me and I'm neither democrat or republican or whatever [Music] they're all rotten they're all rotten they're all just stinking right but I am I'm identified in inner Glory and I'm identified in her shame because of that flag and because of Veterans Day this week thank you because of Veterans Day this week I can stand here and preach to you this message and we don't have to hide in a cage and we don't have to be ashamed of what we believe and we don't have to water it down and dilute it down I was identified at Plymouth Rock I was identified at Guam I was identified in the wars but I'm identified with Jesus Christ hanging on the cross I'm identified he's no longer and a cross he's no longer on a tomb he is Our Risen Savior he is our great high priest today I'm identified with the Lamb of God [Applause] ah blessing Lord someday I'll try to finish this next week someday will walk together through the streets of gold we'll enjoy all of Heaven's Beauty but the greatest thing we want to hear him say is I want to be very honest with you I never want to bring him shame I never want to bring him shame I never want to inflict a wound on him today when you come here to hear us preach I have a theme Here for new ones I have a thing I'm never going to beat you I want to motivate you I want to inspire you I want to strengthen you I want to bring you courage I want to give you confidence that you can win I don't want you to make you feel like some raggy taggy makeshift individual I want to make you feel like you're an overcomer and you can make it through any dark trial that you've got to go through because some of you I may be fighting cancer but some of you are fighting much worse battles than I'm fighting and I want you to know we can make it [Music] [Applause] oh here's my last statement of the day brother Chris I I think you guys are the last ones here other than Johnny that just gave his heart to the Lord your grandfather introduced brother Homer to the message you told me something the other day about we found our way here I never pulled on you to come but I knew you were coming I had no doubt I knew you were coming your great-grandfather but I never asked you to fill out a sheet and saying this is my faults is that right and this is what you're going to have to watch out for in me brother Ron no here's the way this works I'm not looking for your history I'm looking for your future let's stand foreign never take it wrong when I tell you I love you because I really mean it I really mean it I may not have ever had the strength in this life to come and have lunch with every one of you sat down in Fellowship all day long because I'll go home this afternoon and probably sleep a couple hours after dinner just to
