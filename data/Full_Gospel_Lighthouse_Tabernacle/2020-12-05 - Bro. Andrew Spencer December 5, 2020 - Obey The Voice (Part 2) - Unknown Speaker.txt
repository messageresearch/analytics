god bless you i'm glad to be back amen thank the lord for your prayers and i certainly appreciate your prayers of with us as we went through a couple of bumps in the road over the last couple of weeks and and we thank the lord for his mercy and his kindness to us and uh those things just happen and i i just want to share a couple things with you maybe you have or have not heard a week before last we went to a four hour eye doctor appointment to which that they ran all kinds of tests on my eyes every i i just you just can't believe they can do those things to your eyes but they do it two months ago i had had that same thing done and it was at a different clinic with the different doctors of uva and and they found cancer in my left eye and it was two distinct things that was there and they found two two globs they wasn't seeming to be growing but it may have been the place to where that it initially started and so they were they were concerned maybe we didn't share that with you but it was there in my left eye and so they sent me to another eye clinic which was a another level to kind of look at it and they went through the same four hours of tests and sister connie's just just real patient with with me doing those things and so she was there for a lot of it and some of maybe you've went to different eye clinics but yeah when it comes to cancer they go through a lot of different kinds of tests well they went through an extensive amount of tests and they took more pictures than i never thought they would ever take when we got done the doctor looked at me and he was kind of had a british accent and he said well that cancer that was in that screen is not in this screen that's hallelujah and god does everything really nice i had two cataracts that were developing and they said in the next couple of years that those would have to come off well they're gone from one screen to another screen so not only did he take care of cancer he took your cataracts hallelujah so we were really thrilled to get that news and and so we were thankful for that and then on that coming saturday i went hunting in the morning with the boys and it they had these guys have been taking really good care of me driving me to my stand helping me get into the to the blind or whatever i'm doing and these these guys have been just really good to me and uh if i need to need to get up a hill they'll help me get up a hill or whatever needs to be done and so we came home and we had lunch and and when i woke up i knew i knew i was in trouble and so i i the medicine that i take i take about 20 pills a day i take eight cancer pills a day and that's my treatments and so they're they're sometimes pretty vicious brother andy you kind of know some of these treatments that one day they'll treat you good one day they'll treat you really bad and so and so anyway anyway i i i it's hard on it's hard on all your organs and so they told me at some point that there might be a hard issue and so i woke up from my my nap and i i like it that they instruct me to take a nap brother vernon every evening because they say it's healing so i like to have some healing and so i don't i didn't i never didn't need a prescription before but i really enjoy the the prescription and so i sometimes it's a 10-minute nap sometimes it's a two-hour nap and so after i preach on sunday morning it's a three-hour nap so so anyway i woke up and my chest felt like like everybody says it's an elephant on your chest and i i went in and took my blood pressure and it was 235 over 117 and so sister connie contacted brother nathaniel and sister sue and they said get a nitroglycerin peel in see if it will go down and so it we actually took four nitroglycerin peels as the evening would progress we went brother nathaniel rode with me in in the truck sister connie from nascar drove me to uva and so anyway we i didn't want to go to the local hospitals and i know i'm on live okay but my dog get sick i'll send them there but but i i don't go to there so and so anyway i i i went to uva and so my blood pressure was when i was arriving at uva was 178 over 138 and so and so they begin to work on me there they were thinking just like brother nathaniel was thinking that i'd had a heart attack i was showing every symptom of a heart attack and people begin to pray you begin to pray others begin to pray and literally every every bit of those things that was happening to me went away they just went away and the doctor i went back to the cancer doctor on on wednesday and she just looked at me and she said you had a supernatural intervention and it was such an intervention until there was no no problems within the heart and no no molecules even on wednesday brother nathanael there was still no lab things that showed that we had a heart episode it was as though it never happened that's kind of like the blood of jesus christ it was as though it never happened in the first place amen and so i i felt a little bit rough on sunday so that's why you didn't see me last weekend and then on monday i was weak and then tuesday i felt back to myself and so here we are tonight and so i'm really just thrilled to see you amen isn't god good amen i'll be glad and all this coveted business is over with i have an announcement for you tonight and i just and i'll share with you a scripture first if i can't i didn't i didn't ask for a limit of time but andrew's going to speak for you in a little bit and you know a southern people we can't say hello without taking five minutes to do it jesus is speaking in the scriptures and he said he said there was a king the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king that made a marriage for his son and he sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding that they would not come and again he sent forth servants and said tell them which are bidden behold i have prepared a dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and they're ready and come into the marriage but they made light of it and went their ways and one went to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and and treated them spitefully and slew them when the king heard this heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed them and destroyed those murderers and burned up their their city then said he to the servants the wedding is ready but they which are bidden are not worthy go you into the highways and as many as you find bid to the marriage so so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests and when the king came in to see the guest he saw a man which had not owned the wedding garment and he said unto him friend how camest thou into hither having not a wedding garment and he was speechless and the king said to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into the outer darkness and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called and few are chosen i read that scripture with with this in mind generally every year we have a a christmas dinner and we enjoy we enjoy being able to be together in our christmas dinner and we generally have it in the fellowship hall but we're renovating that right now and and we don't have the room to accommodate everybody there because we have social distancing that we have to take care of i continue to have a burden on my heart that i'd like to have us all together to have a meal and so it just kept it kept being a burden on my heart and so so we were at traditions the other day been a few weeks ago and we spoke to kayla which is the owner of that place and and she actually went to school with brother matthew she's a very nice individual and and so we just we just shared what was on our heart that we'd like to do for our audience and they have two two rooms there most of you've been there they have two rooms there and and um she said well you know we shut down on sunday afternoon and and if you would like to do that we would open back up for you as your church alone and it wouldn't be no guess from outside it would be just you people and we will we will do social distancing there gloves for you to be able to use for getting the food and everybody must wear a mask when they're up and so you know we told them we would abide by the rules and we we we want to do that as a group of people and so you know we didn't have a lot of choices on dates we could only take one date and that was the date that she would uh could accommodate us because other churches are wanting to do the same thing and and i can appreciate that and so we have we have got that for the 20th 20th on sunday and it will be at 2 30 uh a 3 30 in the afternoon so we'll have time for for church that morning and then we will we will go maybe i'll preach like brother tim pruitt that sunday morning and and and just deliver deliver my whole heart and then we just drive right straight there but we would like to have both groups to come and uh and we'll have maybe we'll have a deacon or two at the door just to make sure that that it's just our people and i and i'm gonna just say this to you those that's been gone for months and hasn't showed up for covet related scared to come and worship with us you're not invited don't bring your cousins sisters mothers sisters joins whatever and you say well brother ron that didn't that offends me can't come to church [Music] now i understand people being scared about not coming not not wanting to carry it back to their 90 year old parents and i understand people that want to stay away but the rule that you applied to yourself about not coming to church applies to you about not coming to the dinner that offends me that's the reason i read the scripture because jesus is preparing a denim and it's more important than traditions i'm paying for your dinner here you don't have to do anything you can lay a tip on the table to help the ladies if you want to but let me just say this to you the dinner that we preach here every saturday and sunday night is more important than traditions and and let me just say this to you these are things that you want to hear and some of you don't want to hear but i'm going to say it anyway understand that you do it at your home you have a family dinner your neighbors don't come are you with me and you you know it don't matter if it's at the fellowship hall or if it don't matter if it's at a picnic if you if you bring 10 people and they never come to church and never are interested in church and they show up and eat the chicken and they kind of look at the pasture cockeyed and you think where in the world did these people come from hallelujah i'm giving this same speech tomorrow morning and you say well brother ron that offends me let me just say this is traditions is really not that important but the marriage supper of the lamb is going to be important it's going to be important it's going to be important and let me just say here's where you get the wedding garment and it's the holy ghost it's the message of the hour and if you don't have the message of the hour dress around you and the holy ghost inside of your life you don't get a place at the table brother ron that offends me good because i want you to be offended if the word comes by you and it offends you if a fork offends you the word of god will offend you but i want this to be a joyous time for us as a body of believers and we're not inviting the whole world we're on the internet tonight and and i know there's a people on the internet that says hey we get a free meal we we watch these services all the time we'll just show up there i'll have deacons to take care of that so if you don't come to you say well i've been a member of this body but i've laid out for the last six months because of kobe let me just say stay at your house and don't make us offend you there all right the rapture's going to happen and you're going to be staying at your house anyway so don't get excited she will she will accommodate us kayla will accommodate us it everybody got those instructions hallelujah hallelujah i used to have brother homer to do this but and he could do it so well i got matthew but i wanted to make sure i don't want people mad at matthew he looks so good tonight and of course we never want nobody mad at andrew because he and so i told andrew he can come out and clean this up if he needs to clean it up and so he'll be doing that after a while and but i do want you at the wedding supper but kayla's going to do her best to accommodate us we just simply need a count what we're going to do some of you have text sister connie and told us that you're going to be there and i would like for you to continue for those that have not texted her i want you to come tell them turn to your neighbor don't breathe on them turn to your neighbor and say brother ron wants you to come to this dinner hallelujah amen amen if you if you're sitting home on your couch and you're you haven't come in in a year turn to your wife and tell her say he don't want us coming i don't want us coming he don't want us hallelujah hallelujah is that okay yeah is that all right now now how many of you in this live audience is coming stand to your feet i'm going to get you a real quick count for sister connie all right all right who's going to count well there's people under there that's that they may not see them yeah you that's tonight's count you get the pulpit as well i'm gonna go i'm gonna be there you know how many we have 90. okay we'll do that again in the morning and those that that are essential that that come tonight that will be here in the morning yeah amen don't stand up look over at your wife saying he don't want us to stand up amen i know it's christmas time i know i i know i hope it don't interfere with too many meals it's going to go on but we so appreciate you you're doing that and i hope you still love me at the end of the day yeah yeah and so you you went through school you had teachers that had to say it straight so you had to have a pastor that has to say it straight and during covet conditions we have to do different things because health departments listen to our broadcasts like tonight and they want to know that when we go there are we going to keep our social distancing is it going to be okay to bring the two drip groups together and they have two rooms that we can spread out a little bit and we sure appreciate that amen amen isn't god good amen maybe i should have told the miracles last amen but aren't you glad to be invited to the marriage supper of the lamb a many many many many man god bless you so love you each and every one good to see you tonight [Applause] amen amen let's stand at this time hallelujah maybe sister julia will prepare to come sing for us at

there let's sing that song said i wasn't gonna tell nobody but i couldn't keep it to myself couldn't keep it to myself couldn't keep it to myself i said i wasn't gonna tell nobody but i couldn't keep

[Music] so i've been there in the lowest of times i've had questions in my mind i've been scared but i know that i have a savior who knows right where i am and hears my prayer in the midst of all the problems and burdens of this [Music] when i'm sinking down [Applause] lord help me to when the waves are crashing around may i keep my eyes on you cause lord you're the only one who can help me get through the middle of my storm [Music] i don't know how the story will end i didn't see this in the plants you had for me but i know that i can trust all things [Music] though i may not know the answers till i reach the other side i will keep my eyes on jesus till my faith lord hold my hand [Music] [Applause] lord help me to when the stand are crashing around may i keep my [Applause] [Music]

keep my eyes on you cause lord you're the only one who can help you are the only one who can help me get through the middle of my storm the middle of my storm amen aren't you thankful aren't you thankful that he's the god that's got you by his hand amen it's good to be in the house of the lord this evening and i'm glad i don't have to do any cleanup work and i so appreciate our pastor and everything that he said and certainly thankful for what god has done for brother ron i know that he shouldn't have to go through every everything that he has to go through but god god knows what he's doing and god knows what he's doing for us as a body of believers to get us in a condition for a rapture and i believe that's where our goal is set on as children of god is is is that rapture that body change everything that's within us we're pushing for that and and so we so appreciate the word of the lord and uh thankful for that song sister julia amen amen let's stay and then uh as we get ready to turn our hearts to the word let's sing that song you're playing for church i know my redeemer lives [Music] where to amen in the morning and who told the ocean you could only come this

them and lord i pray that you would just just show your children father how much you mean to them tonight by just speaking a word of truth to them lord we know that the the word is a discerner of the heart we just pray that you would minister to every one of us lord where we're at in our life i pray father that you come by our way lord as we yield ourself to the angel of the lord as you begin to

under your voice draw near to you father like only you can do father draw us into your presence in christ's name we pray amen amen if you have your bibles this evening i'd like to turn over the first samuel chapter 3. verse 1. first samuel chapter 3 in verse 1. amen say a man when you have it this evening amen and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision and it came to pass at that time that when eli was laid down in his place and his eyes began to wax dim that he could not see and here the lamp of god went out into the temple of the lord where the ark of god was and samuel was laid down to sleep that the lord called samuel and he answered here am i and he ran unto eli and he said here am i for thou callest me and he said i called not lie down again and he went and laid down and the lord called yet again samuel and samuel rose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and he answered i called not my son lie down again now samuel did not yet know the lord neither was the word of the lord yet revealed unto him and the lord called samuel again the third time and he arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and eli perceived that the lord had called the child therefore eli said unto samuel go and lie down and it shall be if he called thee thou shall say speak speak lord for thy servant heareth so samuel went and laid down in his place and the lord came and stood and called as at other times samuel samuel then samuel answered speak for thy servant heareth also verse 19 and samuel grew and the lord was with him and to let none of his words fall to the ground may god bless his word he may be seated this evening i'd like to continue looking at this thought on obeying the voice of the lord and it's some very powerful things when you go to studying out the the voice of the lord and and there's definitely more things that we could dive into in a few weekends on the voice of the lord but when you go to studying out on on obeying the voice of god and you go to looking at men of god and you begin to look at the women of god and you begin to look at throughout throughout the old testament and you begin to look at the people of god and and it's not just necessarily the men that we point to but it's also women that we see in the bible and and we see that we see ladies of truth and ladies of grace and ladies that made it into the lineage of jesus and you see ladies that would stand out like sarah and and rebecca and even rachel and even hannah and esther and ruth that would that would come out and men like abraham and isaac and jacob that would that would come out and only the reason that you and i even know about abraham and sarah or or isaac and rebecca or esther and ruth is because they were a type of people that were willing to stand out from the crowd and was willing to step out and take god at his word and i believe that even today that god is looking for somebody that's willing to stand out from the crowd not necessarily to be different but to take him at his word because i believe that truly that is what god wants every one of us to do is simply take him at his word and i don't think it gets too high above that or necessarily too low below that but god just simply wants you to take him at his word and even the prophet would say that the angel of the lord he loved that song he always come near to to only believe because that's all it takes is and if you if you don't believe one thing that i say tonight i won't be able to help you but if you believe the things that i speak this evening they'll be a help to you and you begin to look and you see men of god and women of god that would stand there and you can see how they stood there in the face of criticism and in the face of the trials of life against circumstances of life and then it even translate over in the new testament when when you'd see men of faith and you'd see women of faith of priscilla and aquila and you begin to see you begin to see james and john and and peter and paul and you'd see those men of faith that would stand out there and they would take god at his word and our minds are reminded about when jesus was standing there and he was standing on the shore and and peter and the and his brothers had been out fishing all night and they caught nothing all night and and there was a man that they they hadn't necessarily come in custom to with yet but they were getting ready to become accustomed to him because of things that he was going to speak to them they would be spirit and they would be truth and they'd be life and they would see the manifestation of his voice as it came into existence that he was a manifest he was manifesting the things that he spoke but when he's standing there on that shore and he says he says castroned on the other side now here's men that they were as soon as they were able to stand up they were in a boat they knew how to fish and they were there they'd fist all night they toured all night and jesus is standing there and he says throw your net on the other side now any man knows it's done any fishing in life that when you bring your boat up on the bank of the bank of the shore there that fish if they're anywhere close to the shore that they'll begin to scatter when the water gets trouble but here these men that had been fishing all night they come to the shore they've got their boat against the shore and they're almost on land but jesus says cast your net on the other side and as soon as as soon as peter said nevertheless lord hath thy word i let down my net and they enclosed a multitude of fishes even till their necks begin to break you see simply these things came into existence supernatural things were only coming into existence because they simply took god at his word i wonder what would come into your net tonight that though there might be a troubling of watering and though there might you may have done this time and time again you come to service and you didn't see necessarily get anything in your net but there's a man that would say just catch janet on the other side and you bring in a catch of a lifetime so we can look back and we can see when when men of god when god would tell somebody or we would when god would do something for somebody we can look back in history and we can see what god told them to do and we can watch how that they obeyed what god said and how that those there were those that disobeyed what god said and we can see what god did to them and we can learn what you and i can do what we must do in life in obeying his word and then studying out the message and studying out scriptures that one of the most profound statements that there is to me throughout the whole message is that now full obedience to the whole word of god entitles us to the token that when we pray we must have that token to present with our prayer you see now what does he do then when you have when you can have and present that token with your prayer it shows that you have fully come to obedience to the whole word of god and when you've got that token it shows that you have obeyed every word then you and the word are one and you're only asking for the thing that you are oh hallelujah that when you and the word become one you're only asking for the thing that you are you're no longer separated from the things of truth but you and the word have become one he said now if i say to this hand hand you obey me and reach out for their handkerchief it doesn't the hand obeyed me why it's a part of me then when you and the word becomes one every promise glory to god every promise is yours and it obeys you now i know that this is sometimes it's extreme things for people for them to understand that when you as a son and daughter of god when you take god at his word and you see what to the world would say is an extreme thing it's just a part of you for you to come and do to worship him in spirit and in truth it's just a part of you for you to lay a hold on eternal life for you to grab a hold of healing for you to grab ahold of the promises of god it's not extreme for you it's a part of who you are and when you become a part of the word you will see bible days and bible promises and bible signs and bible wonders come into existence when you start taking god at his word you can have your circumstances a mile long i've got fear you're either going to be led by fear controlled by fear or you're going to be either led by love you can have your circumstances a mile and a half long but brother branham would preach a sermon called perfect faith and he would tell us that perfect faith is the master of all circumstances anybody got any circumstances in life well praise the god we've got angels sitting here amongst us this evening now you just forgive us humans we go through life you angels you may not understand everything that we go through but we have circumstances and the prophet would tell us that perfect faith is the master of all circumstances and that when you take him at his word no matter what it is it masters it and he said you just watch and when you believe anything you do anything you got faith in what you're doing no matter what that circumstance circumstances that don't have one thing to do with it it masters that circumstance if it's in a room of sickness and the lord revealed that this certain thing is going to happen you just speaking and go on just don't ask any question it's already over now just keep going now to me that is one of the most that is the one of the most difficult things to get over in the human element is not asking anything because when you can tell somebody when the word of the lord would come and it would anoint you to say a certain word you'll watch as that human and they'll begin to well they'll begin to ask so now now does this got to be in place or does that got to be in place no you just take him at his word and when you you you set everything in order and the hat is in place and the promises are in line you know that it's got to come to pass you see if you can line yourself up with what the vision says then the vision will speak you ain't got to ask well do i got to do this do i got to wear this or do i have to do this everything just comes to pass because perfect faith don't ask perfect faith ain't asking do i take this perfect faith ain't asking what about this situation what about my family history what about the things i've dealt with perfect faith don't ask perfect faith is settled perfect faith is looking at a perfect word that brings to pass a perfect result hallelujah you see faith believes that god will work it out you know every one of us we we have we have days when we feel like we're on top of the mountain we got days when we feel like we're the only one on the face of the earth and anybody ever had them moments in life when it feels like it's raining raining all day long and the sun ain't shining and you feel like your whole your whole uh acquire your whole attire that you're wearing is completely soaked out and one thing i hate in life is wet socks but you you get through when you ever feel like you're going through you're going through that it's just a raining period if it's going to happen to anybody it's going to happen to me if it wasn't for a bad luck or wouldn't have no luck at all and you're going through life and you're going through these circumstances and you feel like you know what all all the all the puddles of life have just soaked in your socks and you're completely soaked to the bone and you're sitting there saying is this really happening to me now i could see if it happened to sister susie back there because she ain't been living right but this is happening to me but i got good news for you god's the god of the rain and he knows when to stop it and he's god of the sun and he knows when to shine on you [Applause] you can go through some stuff but keep your head up don't get so consumed with your circumstance that you hallelujah that you become more of a circumstance than your circumstance is attached to you you ever met somebody that all they ever have is problems that you no longer know them by their name you know them by their problems you don't ask them how they're doing because they're going to give you a 20-minute spill on how they're doing you just add you just go by them and you no longer say hey how you doing you just say god bless you but there's sometimes people go through life and they're looking and they're down in the moly grubs and they think it can't get no worse than this wake up there's somebody out there that's going through a worse storm than what you're going through let me say this to you maybe maybe it'll help somebody i remember days when i thought that life would just would always continue and i would be filled with that same that same energy that i had at 15 and 17 years old and there was stuff running through my veins that couldn't be controlled and you if you would put it on the inside of a horse he'd win a kentucky derby every single time and there was things running in my veins and i thought that i was bigger than life and that everybody everybody that i was a party and everybody needed to be around me and i thought that life would not stop and you ever get that mentality so i know young people go through it all the time when they they feel like they're invincible that they ain't got to wear their seatbelt in life and they can just roll through life and nothing's ever going to happen to them i know what i'm talking about i was in that spot where i thought that i was invincible but i i love it when reality sets in and sometimes when i would get to that spot when i would get to that spot in life when i thought i was invincible and that i was superman and i had the s all over my shirt spelled spencer superman i thought i was really something then my dad would give me a reality check he would take my invincible self to a nursing home and he would point to people that were great men and women in life that were full of ambition for they were presidents and banks they were great men great lawyers life came by their way and he would point me to these things maybe it's time that some young people start revisiting some nursing homes and realizing that life is bigger than your emotions and life is bigger than your circumstances there's somebody going through something worse than what you're going through most people didn't think they'd ever end up there but life continued on a path and it put them in a bed where they didn't even know their name life is real life is real i won't say the person i was speaking to just for security reasons but i was i was on the phone with one of my friends yesterday evening and they began to tell me about a story more than a story but a person that was bound to a wheelchair all of their life been through everything imaginable went through surgery after surgery had webbed hands and everything imaginable went to uva all the time and was going through certain going through anything and everything unimaginable but yet this man had a positive attitude and they began to relate to them what their pastor would tell them that if you can if you can look at philippians chapter 4 and verse 8 that whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are pure think on these things that if you can take this scripture and let this be your motto in life it will change your life well this man's name was eddie he was bound to a wheelchair with through all of these circumstances went through life but he had the right mental attitude and he said if i can think on these things if i can think on these things and he and he and he made this comment before he passed away he said now he said it don't matter whether you're bound in a wheelchair or whether you're walking it matters on what you're thinking here's a person that's bound to a wheelchair bound to circumstances but would have that kind of a positive attitude that would say no matter what you're going through it depends on what you're thinking you can go through some stuff but it doesn't matter what you're going through it matters on who you're thinking come on somebody if you're all you're thinking about is the natural and you're thinking about this flesh you're missing it there's a bigger picture here hallelujah let me bring it now i just give it to you in a natural but let me give it to you in the spiritual you can go through every chain you can be a brother that's locked up in china behind prison bars but it depends on what you're thinking you might think you're going through some things in life but let me bring it to you there is a voice that will break the chains of circumstance in your life that if you listen to this voice if jonah went through his circumstances and went through his symptoms it wouldn't get no bigger you ain't got no more symptoms than what jonah had everywhere he looked it was whale's belly when he went through there and the only scene was whale's food but he knew that if he could ever turn his eyes toward that holy temple and he would pray that god would hear him i want you to know if you can let your voice ring out through your circumstance god will hear you hallelujah this voice will take you higher i don't care what i got to go through you said you better be careful brother andrew let me tell you the spencer family full gospel lighthouse you've been through some stuff but as long as jesus is with me come hell come high water come prison come circumstances come cancer come tuberculosis come sugar diabetes come whatever may if jesus is with me who can be against me i got the god on the inside of me that can speak peace to a storm hallelujah as long as jesus is with me i know that he's bigger than the storm you ever gone through some stuff you ever gone through some storms you ever gone through some moments in life and all of a sudden god says hey i'm bigger i'm bigger than your problem i've got this you might run out of gas you might run out of food you might run out of money you might run out of energy but god don't run out he don't run out of authority he don't run out of strength he don't run out of power he don't run out of blessings he don't run out of the holy ghost he's unlimited in power unlimited in strength unlimited in joy unlimited in happiness he's unlimited in blessings and we've got untapped resources the tree of life has no end to it hallelujah i'm bigger than your problems i'm bigger than your circumstance i'm the god that created you and everything in heaven and in earth has to obey my voice i'm bigger than it i'm bigger than migraines i'm bigger than depression i'm bigger than back pain i'm bigger than laodicea hallelujah i'm bigger than anything of peer pressure that a young person can go through i'm bigger than your boss and i know how to get rid of your boss so your boss don't get rid of you i'm bigger than your 401k i'm bigger i'm bigger i'm bigger than cancer i'm bigger than tall more i'm bigger than the buffeter i'm bigger than the troubler i'm bigger hallelujah all it takes is omnipotence to speak and the miraculous starts happening no matter the wheelchair no matter you're walking what are you thinking i sent this to brother ron last night he said that's a keeper so i want you to keep this forgive me you can never go forward you can never go forward until you're perfectly satisfied and know without a shadow of doubt that you're walking in god's will and then when you know that you're in god's will and walking in his way nothing can stop you because you know where you're standing at you know the way you're going you know what's going on what you got in your mind you know what the will of god is and that you can do it hallelujah when you got when you're completely satisfied in your mind who's on your side had it not been for the lord where would i be had it not been for jesus who came and set me free but it's not about your failures in your past you got to be able to move on from your past are you with me the children of israel were warped in ai because of one man seeing 36 men died they were living in their past failures but god says raise yourself up i'm going to move you past your failures and i'm going to move you into the promise oh hallelujah and once they got the sin kicked out of the camp god blessed them more than what he was going to give them in the in the beginning oh i hate i know that hell has got to hate that thought that though you may have failed before but when you come to that same battle again when you come through that battle god's going to give you more you may have failed here before but get on the other side of that failure and god's given you more of heaven if you could realize tonight that all of heaven is packed on the inside of your soul no weapon that is formed against me shall prosper hallelujah hallelujah obedience is greater than sacrifice you remember the story that brother branham would tell us about the about the two ladies that had come through the prayer line and they all obeyed they had obeyed what god said and how the angel went and passed through the neighborhood to remember that story how that the one woman had stomach trouble and she had the issues and she couldn't eat and the other lady had had a border on her neck that you could visibly see and they had went by and they went through the went through the line and brother branham told him to go on and go on and eat and be well and you remember the story about the how that that lady that she went on professing her healing even though she would get sick every day if she would eat something he would come back up and her daughter even her daughter said mama you're bringing a reproach to the cause of jesus christ but she kept on testifying now this is what brother branham said he said because she went out and tried to obey what the lord told her to do the angel passed through the neighborhood six weeks later i want to tell you you may try tonight to obey what he says but within six weeks he's coming by your way you can shake the sheets and the tumor won't be there you can look through the house and your stomach trouble won't be there i want to tell you tonight if you try my jesus you won't try another drug you try my jesus you won't try alcohol hallelujah well i can see we're going places tonight he says if you amount to anything you're going to stand for god and you'll stand alone it's you anybody can stand when everybody's standing with them but when you're the only one when you're the only one in the picture when you're the only one going through the battle but i read a statement this week your voice will end the battle hallelujah what if you're the only one and you're down in a hole fighting 800 for listings you're the only one that can kill them philistines shamgar's family have been attacked over and over again but finally it hit him who am i i'm a royal seed of abraham i've obeyed the promises and i will not allow these circle uncircumcised philistines to destroy my family it's a time that the people of god rise up and they start saying to the devil i know who i am i know in whom i have belief and i'm not ashamed of him go ahead if you want to put a flight a thousand two ten thousand rise up church of the living god hallelujah hallelujah what time did you give it to me now samuel was the earliest hebrew prophet i'm just going to preach what's on my heart tonight i don't know how much longer i may go five more minutes ten more minutes i'm gonna preach to you and whatever's on my heart i think you'll receive it tonight but samuel samuel as we know was one of the earliest hebrew prophets that we see in the bible and we see that the that the word of the lord was that the word of the lord was precious in those days because there was no open vision and we know what a vision is it's the direct word of the lord and so we find so we find that when samuel is living in an hour it's an hour when there's no vision there's no word and the bible says in amos chapter 8 and 11 that it would come a time that there would be a famine that it wouldn't be a famine for bread nor a thirst of water but it would be for the word and the hearing of the word of the lord and the bible tells us in proverbs chapter 29 that where there is no vision the people perish and you see i want to tell you church of the living god we're not in famine you can look out on the world and you can see that everything that they're eating will not produce overcoming life it will not give them the authority to cast down satan in their life and overcome him by the word of testimony and by the blood of the lamb because they're living in a famine and they've got no open vision they don't have to stay that way but i want to tell you you are not in a famine you're in a feast you're the people of a vision you're the people of an open book you're the people that was testified and prophesy in job chapter 2 and verse 28 that in the last days i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh hallelujah there is a time that was coming and i want to say to you this is that and the reason i can say this is that i was there i got the same holy ghost that peter got i got the same holy ghost that paul got i got the same holy ghost said mary got i got the same holy ghost that james got i got the same holy ghost that john got hallelujah i was there it happened to me you can't talk me out of it because i was there now you might be able to talk some of these pentecostals out here today on the outside of the courts you might be able to talk them out of their experience but you're not going to talk a real born-again son and daughter of god out of their experience they're just not a candle they've got a whole candle that's got tallow it's got a wick but the difference between the bride and pentecost is there's a fire there's a fire that only he could put there i know your family don't understand it but there's a fire that was put on the close of the altar you didn't put that fire there he put that fire there and if he put that fire there hell can't blow it out [Applause] hallelujah samuel was willing to stand against what he even knew [Applause] because this voice that was speaking to him told him things against where he was brought up in hallelujah he was born of an odd birth a peculiar child but when the voice came to him he began to tell him of all of eli's wrongdoings how that his sons were taking the flesh off they sacrificed how that they were doing all their own deeds and eli knew that the voice of the lord spoke to him and he said say on say on and he told him all of these deeds and you can look over in first samuel chapter four and you can see when the philistines came down and they attacked them they attacked them they destroyed him and when eli heard of his two sons that had been slain he fell back and died and his daughter-in-law was giving birth his daughter-in-law was giving birth to a son and when she heard the news she died and they named the child ichabod for the spirit of the lord had departed from israel and the ark of the lord had been stolen and when ichabod is wrote over your heart he is saying i will not address this again i will not come to this place again and that's what ichabod has written over so many churches in america that the glory of the lord that was once there is no longer there but be a good cheer ichabod has not rolled over your heart and nicobarg's not rolled over your life ichabod's not rolled over this church we've seen his glory we've witnessed this power we've seen his anointing we've heard him speak it's not just once in a while that the holy ghost falls here he has more of an attendance than some congregants are he's here he's active he's moving he's willing hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the voice of god always meets the need of the hour and he's always on time he don't miss his moment he don't miss his opportunities right on time he didn't come to moses to tell him to build an ark to get ready i'm going to destroy the world by rain he didn't tell moses that that voice was not to him that voice was the noah what good would it have done for moses to build an ark that wasn't going to become a destruction like it was in noah's day hallelujah what good would it have been for noah to preach moses message it would have never done them no good hallelujah let me jump up here what good would it have done for wesley to come and preach the opening of the seals when he was not the messenger to open it it would not have done him no good he couldn't have done it you were still here you were still laying in the ground your 16 elements were still to come into existence and what good would it do for me to preach to you a methodist message that will not put you in a body change what good would it do for you to obey the voice of wesley when it will not over give you overcoming power of laodicea hallelujah but you have received a message and it come from the lips of god you can overcome you can beat laodicea you're not a part of her and she's not a part of you samuel was the kind of man that he took god's word and he spoke it i wonder what you would produce in your prayer some of you sisters you know what you prayed you know if you asked for your brothers you know what you asked for i wonder what you would produce in your prayer hannah was the kind of lady that could produce a prophet by prayer she knew the power of prayer and she got to such a spot that it was her approach to her that she couldn't bring fourth child and she got so sorrowful in her spirit that she went in before eli and she went in there and eli thought she was drunk because she was standing before him at the altar and she was standing there and her mouth was moving and nothing was coming out and he said go on put away that wine she said i'm not drunk i'm not drunk i'm only one to bring forth seed hallelujah oh i pray that you go you get so drunk on the holy ghost tonight you'd say this is not new wine this is not obvious but this is a wine that came from the divine and it will push through your life what would be produced in your life if you started praying like hannah prayed oh hallelujah what would you produce would you produce a samuel or would you produce like sarah did in the first act or would you produce an ishmael oh hallelujah hallelujah you have the ability by the power of prayer when you take your token and hold it over top of that prayer that you and the word are the same you can say what jesus said because you're simply obeying what he said and i want to put it to you like this this ain't too hard for you to do you ain't got to make up your own word jesus said you just follow what i say you speak to this mountain you ain't got to make up your own scriptures you ain't got to make up your own thoughts you ain't got to make up overcoming power he's already given to you obey receive accept to move forward mary took the angel's word and she believed it with everything that's within her i told you about this last weekend you hear it before you see it i told you about those jets flying over that you heard them before you seen them and you can look throughout the old testament you can look throughout the new testament and you can see you can hear about the promises and then you can see them come to pass and 800 years before mary ever came on the earth there was a prophet that was saying that a virgin shall conceive that promise was circling it was circling the world and it was waiting on mary to be coming to existence and it was waiting and it was waiting and when mary came hallelujah 16 year old girl that had been raised had been raised to obey that voice but there ain't nobody ever been walked had to walk like mary had to walk there ain't nobody ever had to obey like mary had to obey hallelujah jesus's first cousin had something his mama and daddy had something they could point back to of abraham and sarah that there was a promise of a child coming for 25 years they heard it before they seen it abraham heard about a son coming but when melchizedek come walking up his aisle oh may he come walking up your aisle this evening and when he come walking up his aisle he knew that the promise was coming for he was the one that had spoken he knew then he was getting ready to see it now science calls that the doppler effect that you hear something before you see something you ever gone down the road and you hear an ambulance coming and you can't necessarily pinpoint it where it's at science tells us that the farther that sound is away the longer the wavelength is but as it gets closer that wavelength is shortened up and you then can identify where that sound is coming from now mary had heard about those promises and it was a way stretched out for elijah or isaiah to speak those things and the wavelength was great long 800 years but it was circling and it never did stop hallelujah there was a lot of people that heard it but they didn't see it but mary would be the one that that word would anchor in her womb and it would produce a child that would save his people from their sins she heard it then she saw it hallelujah hallelujah mary ate jesus's body right out of the ground she heard that angel's word she obeyed what he said and the angel said thou art highly favored and the bible said mary pondered these things in her heart oh hallelujah she was going to have to stand criticism for what she was going to say she was making herself she was making herself vulnerable that she was going to say that she was still virgin but she was bringing forth a child oh hallelujah and the more she ate the more jesus begin to grow i pray in the name of the lord as you go to eden that jesus starts growing on the inside of you and you start producing jesus's life jesus works jesus is wonders it's been circling the earth for quite some time that there's going to be a bride that'll be spotless that'll be blameless that'll be made whole and dressed in fine linen i say in the name of the lord it's found its domain it's coming it's coming it's coming and the word that was born in mary hallelujah is born in you and me she didn't care about the critics she didn't care about making herself liable and throw herself out there before the neighbors she began to testify before she ever seen anything on the inside i got a baby on the inside of me that's going to save you he's going to save your family he's going to heal your family he's going to deliver your family this baby that's on the inside of me he's going to pay the sin debt for the whole world before she ever felt little jesus start kicking on the inside she began to testify she was obeying what the voice said now what would take place before the holy ghost was ever given and a little lady 16 years old could let that word anchor in a heart what would it do if it would anchor in your heart born again son and daughter of god i was praying i was praying this evening i said lord i'm just going to tell you lord i'm sick and tired of just giving sermons and people walking in one way and walking out the same exact way i want you to know i'm interested in your soul and i'm sick and tired of just preaching sermonettes to people that only want to hear from a preacher at i'm not a preacher yet i'm a born-again son of god called to preach this message ah i laid it before the lord i said lord i'm sick and tired of just preaching sermons i don't want justice herman i don't want just another thought because if next weekend rolls around we're to have another sermon but i'm sick and tired of people looking at a sermon as just another sermon and i want to inspire every evangelist and i want to inspire every pastor and every preacher in this message i heard a word that said keep stacking word on top of a word and build and sell on top of sale when i come on it when i come on top of that word you watch that body move preachers you may hear me you may hear me around the world but you keep stacking words on top of a word sail on top of sail it'll build a body it'll be a body like his glorious body it'll move in his name it'll act in his name i don't want to have to be like brother branham and that turtle said i want to make that turtle walk he said i found out he said i'm gonna make i'm gonna make that turtle walk and he went over and he got a stick and he start beating that turtle but the more he beat him the more he sat there he said well i'm gonna make him walk one way or another so i'm gonna baptize him i stuck him down in that water and all he did was blah blah blah blah blah hey you can hear these sermons you say man they're beating on me but that ain't ever going to make this body move we can baptize you 14 times but that ain't ever going to make the body move he said but i know a way that i can make that turtle walk and he went over there and he started a fire and put that turtle on top of that fire that turtle started walking when he built that fire let the body move when the fire begins to fall it's time what's that sound i hear a sound oh hallelujah prophesy under these bones can they live again and they'll become a rattling and a shaken and bones come back to life bride of jesus christ you've heard your awakening message this voice will make you obey what the voice

can be running over hallelujah he is coming for a body that's mature he's not coming forth little bitty baby he's coming for a lady that's dressed in a garment of praise this body has got to obey its confession brother branham said if you can make your body if you can surrender your thoughts to his word you watch what takes place he said if you can surrender that alcohol if you can surrender those cigarettes you watch him take over what would happen if you surrendered your whole entire life that you wouldn't be so concerned with your boyfriend and your girlfriend and the things that are going on if you would just start obeying what he said you keep obeying what you said you're gonna stay right here you start obeying what he said hey thank the lord there was a voice that said get back in line get back in line thank god for that voice but i also heard a voice when he come back from that other side whatever you do don't miss it he said it's more than perfect he said it's not in the human vocabulary the words to describe that place now i want to drop this to you you can obey his voice and your body come under subjection to his word and you watch your body move into the rhythm of

are that of a perfect heart lord it doesn't say them that are of a perfect life and never made mistakes never fail but to them that are of a perfect heart saul could confess he could say he was sorry but he would do the same thing over and over again but david could stand there and he could confess his faults and confess his sins and because he meant it from his heart he would say o god created me a clean heart and renewing me her right spirit [Music] father we come before you your throne of mercy we open ourselves up to you we've been through circumstances we've been through life we've been through trials but your voice is towards your strength this ain't a man's voice this is an angel's voice he's a mighty angel with a mighty voice with a mighty message with the wind to follow it and confirm that these things are true if you can blow through a college and you can let a pill of fire be made visible how much more can you blow through this place tonight and make your promises come to pass in our hearts lord i pray that we would rise up in courage rise up in faith and set forth from our lives a voice it can't be spout the voice of omnipotence a voice of power a voice of authority

the clouds of fear and the clouds of doubt and may you begin to pour your spirit out begin to fall afresh begin to make yourself known to your people may they obey your voice and may they see the miraculous come to pass go just like the rain my thirsty soul come and fall afresh on me and feel [Music] and make me [Music] just like the rain [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] okay and make me
