[40:02] amen god bless you
[40:12] first of all
[40:24] i'd just like to give just a little
[40:26] small part of the testimony this morning
[40:28] you know back a number of weeks ago i
[40:31] found out
[40:32] um through a lab it was like a shock in
[40:35] my system i'd not been having any
[40:37] problems
[40:38] and i found out that all in one day
[40:41] that my blood pressure was low my hair
[40:44] was falling out
[40:45] and i was dealing with leukemia all at
[40:47] one time
[40:49] and my doctor knows me and she said ann
[40:53] she said god's going to pull you through
[40:54] this she said i'm not sure exactly how
[40:57] but he's going to do it
[40:59] and so prior times i would have a
[41:01] scripture it would drop straight in or a
[41:03] verse of a song
[41:04] and i was just numb and she looked at me
[41:06] and she said
[41:07] i know exactly what your theme is going
[41:09] to be and it's going to be waymaker
[41:12] and she said we're going to go out here
[41:14] on faith and she said we're going to buy
[41:16] waymaker t-shirts and she said we're
[41:18] going to wear them so when you have your
[41:20] treatment
[41:21] and you have your labs she said you'll
[41:23] see we
[41:24] we've got the waymaker and so
[41:27] they offered to pray with me in the
[41:29] morning before everything started and
[41:30] before i leave that we go home
[41:32] and so last week when they got the slide
[41:34] and it was all clear
[41:36] she said ange we're still going to wear
[41:37] our waymaker t-shirts
[41:40] [Music]
[41:45] so i she didn't even realize how to sing
[41:47] the song so i taught them while we were
[41:48] taking treatment how to do this

[1:01:11] by
[1:01:11] you what whatever takes place
[1:01:19] you and i wasn't privy to that
[1:01:22] information but we knew that in
[1:01:25] this life we're going to be molded and
[1:01:28] we're going to go through some things
[1:01:29] and we're going to have some
[1:01:30] disappointments
[1:01:32] this isn't hollywood this isn't disney
[1:01:36] world
[1:01:38] man is born of woman few days
[1:01:43] if you live to be 140 years old few days
[1:01:48] full of trouble some of the things that
[1:01:51] we struggle with at times are petty
[1:01:56] you wore two different colored pair
[1:01:58] shoes to church this morning
[1:02:07] in the side of in the sight of god it's
[1:02:10] okay
[1:02:14] okay your hair didn't turn out like you
[1:02:16] thought it should
[1:02:20] okay you bought a new truck last week
[1:02:23] and it's already in the shop because you
[1:02:24] wrecked it
[1:02:30] it's okay it's okay
[1:02:33] i was shopping for a truck last sunday
[1:02:36] it's already in the shop because it's
[1:02:37] wrecked
[1:02:39] it's okay
[1:02:43] it's okay it's just got a new dink
[1:02:49] they unloaded it last week now they're
[1:02:52] going to fix it
[1:02:57] but i want to say this to you in the
[1:02:59] midst of your darkest trouble
[1:03:01] if you remember who you are
[1:03:05] [Music]
[1:03:06] all of that was to set you up in the
[1:03:09] midst of all of your darkest
[1:03:11] trouble if you remember who you are
[1:03:16] you're greater than every devil in hell
[1:03:23] now i want to just kind of give you a
[1:03:25] little background here jesus had just
[1:03:27] prayed in the garden
[1:03:29] father if it be thy will
[1:03:33] let this cut pass from me
[1:03:37] are you with me he prayed brother graham
[1:03:39] said even in one spot said he prayed
[1:03:42] against the father's will
[1:03:45] he could look at the word and see what
[1:03:47] the word
[1:03:48] said about him that these are the things
[1:03:51] that he was to
[1:03:52] fulfill because remember he was a man
[1:03:56] and as a man he had human feelings
[1:03:59] he wanted to stay here and preach he
[1:04:01] wanted to stay here and have a family
[1:04:04] but he was the redeemer
[1:04:08] are you with me what sent him to the
[1:04:11] cross
[1:04:17] why didn't he give up
[1:04:20] why didn't he turn around i'm the reason
[1:04:25] i'm the reason the lamb's book of life
[1:04:28] redemption was the plan
[1:04:32] are you with me he had showed
[1:04:35] through his life he had power
[1:04:39] over death hell
[1:04:42] he had the power to raise to kill a tree
[1:04:45] to raise a man back to life he had the
[1:04:48] power
[1:04:49] over creation
[1:04:53] call a storm out of existence turn water
[1:04:57] into wine take fish and and bless it
[1:05:01] and it would become enough
[1:05:04] because the power of his words that
[1:05:07] there would be
[1:05:08] more fragments
[1:05:12] are you with me you possess the same
[1:05:14] power in your life
[1:05:17] but it's a it lays on the inside of you
[1:05:20] but it operates by law
[1:05:22] of faith
[1:05:26] there's a few things that jesus could
[1:05:28] look at the word and see
[1:05:31] they're going to beat me like no other
[1:05:34] human being
[1:05:35] that has ever been beaten they're going
[1:05:38] to cover
[1:05:39] have a trial on me because the word
[1:05:42] told him this is what they're going to
[1:05:44] do
[1:05:46] the people that you love is going to
[1:05:49] hate you
[1:05:51] they're going to send you to calvary
[1:05:55] you're not going to be even able to
[1:05:57] carry your own cross
[1:06:00] it was written in the scriptures
[1:06:04] it was written in the scriptures about
[1:06:06] this is what you're getting ready to go
[1:06:08] through
[1:06:09] he had to surrender himself
[1:06:12] to it before he ever said
[1:06:15] i am he
[1:06:19] now judas sold him out
[1:06:24] he sold him out for a handful of change
[1:06:28] sold him out thinking jesus would take a
[1:06:31] different direction
[1:06:32] i wonder how many people that has sold
[1:06:35] the message out
[1:06:37] how it turned out for them
[1:06:40] i'm not speaking about locally i'm
[1:06:42] speaking around around the world
[1:06:45] are you with me and and when jesus is
[1:06:49] standing there
[1:06:50] and here comes judas with his 500
[1:06:54] men of well-armed soldiers
[1:06:58] of the of the sanhedrin council as
[1:07:01] they're coming to get
[1:07:03] jesus
[1:07:08] coming to get a preacher coming to get a
[1:07:11] healer
[1:07:13] coming to get a man that's that is
[1:07:16] quiet in his spirit
[1:07:20] and they bring 500 men
[1:07:24] vicious warriors no wonder you have so
[1:07:28] much trouble in your life
[1:07:30] when satan sends demons to your house
[1:07:34] how many does he send
[1:07:40] and you look like a little puny
[1:07:42] housewife about a
[1:07:44] 130 pounds or whatever you are i'm not
[1:07:47] here that way
[1:07:51] are you with me and you just flicked
[1:07:53] devils off
[1:07:56] you just flick them off because you
[1:07:59] remember who you
[1:08:00] are
[1:08:04] are you with me go back to hell satan
[1:08:08] just go back to hell i'm not put up with
[1:08:11] you today
[1:08:19] when jesus said i
[1:08:23] am he 500
[1:08:27] men collapsed
[1:08:32] the force that was released in
[1:08:35] i am he
[1:08:40] who was greater than
[1:08:44] no doubt had a dirty robe on he'd been
[1:08:48] down
[1:08:48] wallowing on the ground praying tears
[1:08:50] running down
[1:08:52] until his blood became his his sweat
[1:08:54] became his blood
[1:08:57] stains on his on his on his robe
[1:09:02] and he said i am he the devil knew who
[1:09:05] he was
[1:09:07] but it fulfilled the scriptures that
[1:09:10] they would fall
[1:09:11] backwards and they were slain in the
[1:09:14] presence
[1:09:17] of jesus christ
[1:09:21] getting back up getting back up to
[1:09:24] arrest him
[1:09:26] and peter would get so excited he would
[1:09:30] grab a sword
[1:09:31] and cut off of the the high priest here
[1:09:35] are you with me jesus had to remind him
[1:09:38] this is not a flesh and blood affair
[1:09:42] this is not a flesh and blood affair
[1:09:43] this isn't what we do
[1:09:45] and jesus told his lead disciple get
[1:09:48] behind me satan
[1:09:52] and then he healed he took the the
[1:09:56] the priest's ear and put it back on and
[1:10:00] it was healed
[1:10:10] the devil knows who he is
[1:10:15] i want to tell you the devil knows who
[1:10:17] he is
[1:10:21] you'll not convince the devil that he
[1:10:23] ain't greater than him
[1:10:26] just laying some foundation here the
[1:10:29] devil knows
[1:10:33] how powerful he is
[1:10:37] that's the reason he tries to convince
[1:10:39] you that you're not who you are
[1:10:41] [Music]
[1:10:42] i want you to get this part because if
[1:10:45] you get this part
[1:10:46] next week will be better
[1:10:50] you remember a couple of weeks ago i
[1:10:52] told you a little bitty woman
[1:10:54] a woman that works two jobs wrote me a
[1:10:58] letter 20 years ago she heard me
[1:11:00] preach on champion and in the middle of
[1:11:04] about a 26 page letter
[1:11:06] she told me she said brother ron be a
[1:11:10] champion
[1:11:13] and something in me rose up
[1:11:24] in first corinthians chapter 9 verse 21
[1:11:27] 22
[1:11:30] paul writes it like this to the weak
[1:11:35] became eyes weak that i might gain the
[1:11:39] weak
[1:11:41] i may i i am i'm made of all things to
[1:11:45] all men
[1:11:46] that i might by all being saved some
[1:11:51] this i do for the gospel sake that i
[1:11:54] might be partaker thereof with you
[1:11:58] know you not that they which run in a
[1:12:01] race
[1:12:02] run off but one receiveth
[1:12:05] the prize so run
[1:12:09] that ye may obtain and every man that
[1:12:13] striving for the mastery is temperate in
[1:12:15] all things
[1:12:17] now they do it they do it talking about
[1:12:20] olympics
[1:12:21] they do it to obtain a corruptable crown
[1:12:26] but we are incorruptable
[1:12:31] i therefore so run not as uncertainly so
[1:12:35] fight eye not as one that beateth the
[1:12:37] air
[1:12:38] i don't have any time to waste here
[1:12:40] that's what he was saying
[1:12:42] but i keep under my body and bring it
[1:12:45] into subjection
[1:12:46] lest that by any means when i have
[1:12:50] preached to others
[1:12:51] that i myself should be a cast away
[1:13:02] paul says i'm not going to get caught up
[1:13:04] with everything that's going up around
[1:13:06] me
[1:13:08] second corinthians chapter 12
[1:13:12] and verse 6 for though i would desire to
[1:13:16] glory i shall not be a fool
[1:13:19] for i will say that now i forbear lest
[1:13:23] that any man should think of me above
[1:13:25] measure
[1:13:26] that which he seeth me to be or heareth
[1:13:28] of me
[1:13:30] unless i should get exalted above
[1:13:32] measure
[1:13:34] through the abundance of revelations
[1:13:36] there was given to me
[1:13:38] a thorn in the flesh the messenger of
[1:13:41] satan to buffet me
[1:13:43] that means blow after blow after
[1:13:46] blow after blow it would go it would
[1:13:49] come and go
[1:13:50] it would come and go it would come and
[1:13:52] go
[1:13:58] i want to draw something out on this if
[1:14:00] i could this morning
[1:14:02] for this i besought the lord thrice
[1:14:07] that it might depart from me
[1:14:12] and if they sayeth unto me my
[1:14:15] grace is sufficient for thee
[1:14:19] god says this my grace
[1:14:22] is sufficient
[1:14:26] for thee for my strength is made perfect
[1:14:30] in weakness most gladly therefore will i
[1:14:33] rather glory in mind affirmative that
[1:14:35] the power of
[1:14:36] christ may rest upon me therefore i take
[1:14:39] pleasure in infirmities and reproaches
[1:14:42] and necessities and persecutions in
[1:14:44] distresses
[1:14:45] for christ's sake alone for when i am
[1:14:48] weak
[1:14:49] then i am strong

[1:17:41] one another we can't shake one another's
[1:17:44] hands we can't
[1:17:45] be intimate with one another like we

[1:18:27] to people to be able to

[1:18:31] come to church
[1:18:33] not scared to go to walmart
[1:18:48] not scared to go to go to work
[1:18:54] not scared to go to mcdonald's and sit
[1:18:56] for two hours
[1:19:01] [Music]
[1:19:03] but terrified
[1:19:07] that when they go to church
[1:19:10] my god i could get sick
[1:19:18] i got a license here you can get mad at
[1:19:21] me if you want to
[1:19:23] but i'm the guy that should be terrified
[1:19:26] of being anywhere
[1:19:37] but i'm not scared i put masks on i go
[1:19:40] where i want to go
[1:19:47] if i'm hungry i'll go eat
[1:19:52] i go to martin's i saw you the other day
[1:19:54] you were packing and
[1:19:55] and uh i didn't bother you
[1:19:58] because i really didn't want it wasn't
[1:20:00] supposed to be there i was too early in
[1:20:01] the game
[1:20:10] are you with me
[1:20:14] what a crazy society we are in
[1:20:18] a year ago if you walked into a bank
[1:20:30] they would press a button
[1:20:32] [Applause]
[1:20:37] but now if you walk into a bank and you
[1:20:40] don't have one
[1:20:41] they press a button
[1:20:53] [Applause]
[1:20:58] oh
[1:21:04] notice the scripture says for this
[1:21:09] i prayed three times
[1:21:12] i sought the lord thrice about this
[1:21:16] now i want to to just just think just
[1:21:18] for a minute this is the man that is
[1:21:20] writing your new testament
[1:21:24] this is the man that has the most
[1:21:26] powerful ministry
[1:21:29] in the entire new testament he stood
[1:21:32] before kings
[1:21:35] great leaders he has raised the dead
[1:21:40] he has prayed for people and they have
[1:21:43] been
[1:21:44] healed he was locked up in prison
[1:21:49] and about the midnight hour they begin
[1:21:51] to rejoice
[1:21:56] this man has shook hell
[1:22:01] he is the one of the greatest orators
[1:22:04] of all of the history of the bible
[1:22:08] yet this man will write the new
[1:22:12] testament
[1:22:13] from a roman dungeon
[1:22:18] and he's got a condition in his body
[1:22:22] to which that it overwhelms him
[1:22:25] that he's dealing with
[1:22:29] he's got a condition in his own flesh
[1:22:33] to which he goes before god and he seeks
[1:22:37] the face of god
[1:22:38] that this thing would leave him
[1:22:44] i'm preaching to you now and it was
[1:22:47] consistently there
[1:22:49] it was consistently battling him
[1:22:53] as a matter of fact he uses the term
[1:22:55] that it kept him humble
[1:23:02] he found something good in it
[1:23:08] andrew asked me that
[1:23:11] he said make a list dad as you go
[1:23:13] through this trial
[1:23:15] make a list of what
[1:23:18] you want to be better have better god do
[1:23:21] for you
[1:23:22] to be better
[1:23:27] well on the first the first top i said
[1:23:30] sister connie i i want god to to
[1:23:33] to be with her be with her through this
[1:23:36] trial
[1:23:37] because through a trial like this it's
[1:23:38] your loved ones that's got to take care
[1:23:41] of you
[1:23:43] because i ain't always preaching in
[1:23:44] strength and power
[1:23:48] are you with me and then i i at the
[1:23:51] bottom of the page i
[1:23:52] i just wrote down i need to be sweeter
[1:24:02] mattis is not here to say amen
[1:24:14] so i walked to the pulpit this morning
[1:24:16] with with my sugar level at 400
[1:24:20] so i'd say that that scripture or that
[1:24:22] request has been fulfilled
[1:24:32] but god is god
[1:24:36] god is god in your trial or out of your
[1:24:38] trial
[1:24:41] and you are who you are in your trial
[1:24:45] or out of your trial
[1:24:51] david writes oh
[1:24:54] spare me that i might recover my
[1:24:58] strength
[1:25:01] that's quite a statement god
[1:25:04] spare me that i might recover my
[1:25:08] strength
[1:25:10] before i go hence and be no more
[1:25:14] psalms 27 same writer the lord is my
[1:25:17] light and my salvation
[1:25:20] whom shall i feel the lord is the
[1:25:23] strength of my life of whom shall i be
[1:25:25] afraid
[1:25:26] when the wicked even mine enemies and my
[1:25:28] foes came upon me eating my flesh they
[1:25:30] stumbled and fell
[1:25:31] though a host should encamp against me
[1:25:34] my heart shall not fear
[1:25:36] if you know who you are
[1:25:40] if you know who you are for shamgar
[1:25:44] 600 men was not enough
[1:25:47] [Music]
[1:25:49] for samson a thousand men was
[1:25:52] not enough obviously in this
[1:25:56] trial
[1:26:00] satan found out he didn't have enough
[1:26:08] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[1:26:10] foes came upon me to eat my flesh they
[1:26:12] stumbled and fell
[1:26:15] though a host encamped against me my
[1:26:18] heart shall not fear
[1:26:19] the war should rise against me and this
[1:26:21] will i be confident
[1:26:23] one thing that i have desired of the
[1:26:25] lord that i will seek after
[1:26:26] that i may dwell in the house of the
[1:26:28] lord
[1:26:34] that i may dwell in the house of the
[1:26:36] lord all
[1:26:37] the days of my
[1:26:40] life so in your
[1:26:44] source of strength is in god
[1:26:48] it's not at barnes and noble to find the
[1:26:51] book of how
[1:26:52] to overcome your battles
[1:26:56] it's not on google or youtube this
[1:26:59] is your your your strength
[1:27:03] this is your source
[1:27:05] [Applause]
[1:27:15] if you'll notice we have came a long way
[1:27:17] in a few weeks
[1:27:22] because i knew that if i could get back
[1:27:25] into this spot
[1:27:28] it would renew the inner man
[1:27:34] it would renew me and strengthen me back
[1:27:36] up to where i'm at are you with me
[1:27:40] not laying on the couch with the pity
[1:27:42] party
[1:27:43] [Applause]
[1:27:45] get back into the house of god that's
[1:27:47] where my strength is
[1:28:00] sister connie one night we'd come to a
[1:28:02] spot of just a
[1:28:04] pivotal spot about four and a half weeks
[1:28:06] ago
[1:28:07] and it was a night of desperation
[1:28:14] and she began to call out to god
[1:28:17] i got a visitation in the night
[1:28:21] and in that visitation to which that
[1:28:24] god spoke to me and into speaking to me
[1:28:30] he took me like a man standing
[1:28:34] any any kind i'm just going to share
[1:28:36] some things if you don't believe it you
[1:28:38] don't have to
[1:28:39] i just have to tell you what's real to
[1:28:41] me
[1:28:43] there's people make fun of supernatural
[1:28:45] experiences but i can tell you i've had
[1:28:47] something that's been powerful
[1:28:49] so i'm going to for the next five
[1:28:51] minutes i want to share a couple things
[1:28:52] with you
[1:28:54] and these things changed my life
[1:29:00] i i saw a vision
[1:29:05] and then this vision it was a of a great
[1:29:08] a great it seemed like a great tearing
[1:29:11] down of things and
[1:29:13] and it would be a great restructuring or
[1:29:16] rebuilding
[1:29:18] and i was standing there and as i was
[1:29:20] standing there
[1:29:21] it seemed like many from this church was
[1:29:23] there
[1:29:24] and we were working and i was looking i
[1:29:27] was looking at some chaos that was going
[1:29:30] on
[1:29:32] and the angel of the lord came and was
[1:29:34] standing behind me and he turned my
[1:29:36] shoulders like this
[1:29:37] ladies hands on my shoulders
[1:29:42] and i was standing and standing down my
[1:29:44] bedroom about four o'clock in the
[1:29:45] morning i was standing looking over my
[1:29:47] bed
[1:29:49] and he and he was just speaking to me he
[1:29:51] says
[1:29:53] and he just kind of held his hand out
[1:29:55] brother homer would do that can i hold
[1:29:57] his hand out like this and he said
[1:30:00] now ron you must see past what you see
[1:30:09] don't look at what you see
[1:30:13] but see past what you see
[1:30:17] and he paused and then he said
[1:30:23] you must think past what you think
[1:30:28] amen
[1:30:32] well the next day you know what i did i
[1:30:34] went and said what saw what brother
[1:30:36] branham said about that
[1:30:38] and brother bam uses the same
[1:30:40] terminology and look into the unseen
[1:30:44] he says you can't look at the things
[1:30:46] that you see with your human elements
[1:30:49] your human senses you must look
[1:30:52] into the unseen realm
[1:30:58] a week exactly
[1:31:02] later i'm still frail i'm still
[1:31:05] weak i'm still struggling through the
[1:31:08] days i'm still
[1:31:09] sick still having great trouble
[1:31:15] a week exactly i got a visitation in the
[1:31:18] night
[1:31:21] a power hit hit that room
[1:31:25] and i went to my office
[1:31:29] and now i you're welcome to cut the
[1:31:32] tapes off you're well welcome to do
[1:31:34] whatever you want to do but i think it's
[1:31:36] a nice nice for you
[1:31:42] i i felt like it what it must have felt
[1:31:44] like with abraham sitting outside the
[1:31:46] tent
[1:31:51] it was as though he was sitting just a
[1:31:54] couple of feet from me
[1:31:56] and talking to me
[1:32:08] there was a question i would this was
[1:32:09] the first time
[1:32:11] ever in my life in my dealings with the
[1:32:14] lord
[1:32:15] that i ever was able to ask a question
[1:32:21] and of all the things that i ask brother
[1:32:24] doug i asked about
[1:32:25] esther

[1:42:59] after a brain bleed to which that they
[1:43:01] opened up the side of her head
[1:43:04] and it actually the cut went from here
[1:43:08] here here here
[1:43:12] the whole side of her head so that meant
[1:43:13] that they shaved the head
[1:43:15] and then of course they shaved the other
[1:43:18] part
[1:43:18] to match the sisters did
[1:43:26] they actually talked to brother tim
[1:43:28] about do you think that she would
[1:43:30] want to have this surgery because
[1:43:33] there's a
[1:43:34] we don't expect her to live or at best
[1:43:36] she'll be a vegetable
[1:43:38] the rest of her life he said
[1:43:41] of course we want you to do the surgery
[1:43:44] but you know you how you and your
[1:43:46] humanity feels when
[1:43:48] it feels like your gut has just been
[1:43:50] pulled out
[1:43:52] you have just been told that your
[1:43:54] husband has three
[1:43:55] major tumors in his head and they're
[1:43:57] cancerous tumors
[1:44:00] sister connie put her head between her
[1:44:04] knees
[1:44:06] and we called for our our boys
[1:44:09] and they came and held her while i was
[1:44:12] getting the diagnosis
[1:44:14] probably live uh of just a few more
[1:44:16] months
[1:44:18] those are difficult times
[1:44:19] [Music]
[1:44:22] but when you catch your breath
[1:44:27] once you catch your breath and absorb
[1:44:30] the punch
[1:44:33] greatest battle ever fought brother bam
[1:44:35] said he's got a punch coming to you
[1:44:38] but once you remember who you are
[1:44:41] [Applause]
[1:44:43] come on let's remember who we are this
[1:44:46] morning
[1:44:50] alden and i was walking down the my
[1:44:53] driveway together here about a month ago
[1:44:57] he's walking along beside of me and at
[1:44:59] that time i was
[1:45:01] i kind of had a slow step to me i was
[1:45:03] just kind of
[1:45:05] doing the best that i could do to kind
[1:45:06] of keep one foot in front of the other
[1:45:09] there's times i just had to beg myself
[1:45:11] to get up off of the couch
[1:45:14] i just couldn't hardly make it i just i
[1:45:16] just felt like
[1:45:17] my head weighed 200 pounds and if i
[1:45:20] could just get my head to
[1:45:21] hold up
[1:45:26] you felt like that brother run yeah
[1:45:29] yeah but you see
[1:45:33] as i was walking down the
[1:45:36] down the pavement with brother alden
[1:45:39] i said brother alden i'm beginning to
[1:45:41] feel a little wind in my wings
[1:45:49] if you can ever get a little wind in
[1:45:50] your wings you get the sand out of your
[1:45:53] wings
[1:45:56] and if you can ever get the sand out of
[1:45:58] your wings
[1:46:02] you get to work you can fluff them a
[1:46:03] little bit
[1:46:06] and after you start fluffing them a
[1:46:08] little bit you you figure out
[1:46:10] they got you off of the ground once
[1:46:12] they'll get you off of the ground again
[1:46:27] andrew came to the house one night after
[1:46:29] a saturday night service and
[1:46:31] i was sitting at the end of our table
[1:46:33] that seats 18
[1:46:34] and i sitting at the end of the table
[1:46:36] and i was having elijah's pity party
[1:46:43] and he throwed a rock in the cave
[1:46:47] you know sometimes you gotta throw a
[1:46:48] rock in the cave
[1:46:51] so the next day i threw it back at it
[1:46:54] out at him
[1:46:56] [Laughter]
[1:46:59] [Music]
[1:47:03] because that night i was seeing a cake
[1:47:05] the cake so he threw a rock in the cave
[1:47:08] and the next day he was saying i can't i
[1:47:11] threw it back out at him
[1:47:17] the baby's not going to die it won't die
[1:47:20] it'll be all right it might think he's
[1:47:22] going to die right now
[1:47:27] i probably got devils screaming about
[1:47:28] like this right now
[1:47:33] there's things that you've asked god for
[1:47:35] for two to three times
[1:47:37] and god just tells you isn't it
[1:47:40] interesting when god says no
[1:47:43] it didn't always better when he said yes
[1:47:51] don't you just love it when god just
[1:47:53] answers a prayer for you in 10 minutes
[1:47:56] and it's over we all love the miracle of
[1:48:00] tabitha the next day she's walking down

[1:52:55] when i was talking to the lord that
[1:52:56] morning
[1:52:59] and i ask about esther
[1:53:07] he just simply made a couple statements
[1:53:10] i'm taking care of her
[1:53:19] but i'm going to take care of the
[1:53:20] greater esther
[1:53:26] i didn't understand because i can't see
[1:53:29] into the future i can't see
[1:53:34] but i can have faith
[1:53:41] it did not hit me
[1:53:48] you know i i write everything down
[1:53:52] i write everything down
[1:53:56] i called brother tim i told him some
[1:54:00] things
[1:54:01] shared with him
[1:54:11] and here i get a note one morning that
[1:54:18] sister karen has been taken to the
[1:54:19] hospital that night with a
[1:54:24] with a brain bleed and they don't know
[1:54:27] if she's going to live or she's not
[1:54:29] going to live
[1:54:30] and we're days later after the
[1:54:34] visitation
[1:54:39] and she may be a vegetable
[1:54:42] this is a horrific scene
[1:54:46] her head is shaved her brain has bled
[1:54:49] it has shifted her brain completely over
[1:54:52] we don't know if her extremities are
[1:54:54] going to work
[1:54:56] whether she's going to have any memory
[1:54:58] whether she'll be able to swallow
[1:55:01] whether she'll be able to cognitively do
[1:55:04] anything or not
[1:55:06] i'm walking down my driveway
[1:55:12] i'm walking down my driveway and i'm
[1:55:14] praying for karen
[1:55:22] and he spoke to me he said i told you
[1:55:27] i would take care of the greater esther
[1:55:33] before the greater esther
[1:55:36] ever had a brain bleed
[1:55:43] who's the greater of our esther that
[1:55:45] we're always praying for
[1:55:47] her mother
[1:55:51] so god had it already planned
[1:55:54] and we were looking at one esther and he
[1:55:57] was looking at the other
[1:56:03] i'm nobody
[1:56:06] but the greater esther went to church
[1:56:08] this morning
[1:56:22] and i want to show you sister suzanne
[1:56:25] that
[1:56:25] god has everything
[1:56:29] pre-arranged before your trial ever gets
[1:56:32] there
[1:56:39] he's already got it taken care of
[1:56:41] knowing in a few days
[1:56:43] the greater esther is going to have a
[1:56:46] situation
[1:56:49] and he tells a preacher 17 hours away
[1:56:56] i'm gonna take care of her
[1:57:02] i walk to the pulpit that weekend
[1:57:05] and i preach a sermon call must get to
[1:57:08] jesus
[1:57:15] and in my must get into jesus
[1:57:18] what you didn't realize that as i was
[1:57:20] preaching
[1:57:22] i was not preaching about jarius 2000
[1:57:24] years ago
[1:57:26] i was preaching about ron spencer as
[1:57:29] jerry as 2000 years ago and whether you
[1:57:33] realize that
[1:57:34] i was struggling with my mortality and
[1:57:36] the deity at the same
[1:57:38] time can
[1:57:41] i live through this trial
[1:57:46] and you as an audience loves me and puts
[1:57:48] up with me in weak or strong
[1:57:52] but whether you knew it or not i was
[1:57:54] preaching
[1:57:55] i got to stand here in this environment
[1:58:00] because i got to get to jesus
[1:58:04] i come to church in a very feeble
[1:58:07] condition
[1:58:08] but i gotta get to jesus
[1:58:13] are you with me now
[1:58:17] i'm stronger today four weeks later
[1:58:20] because in that service when i went
[1:58:23] home and days later i recognized
[1:58:27] that god spoke to me in the service to
[1:58:30] make an insane
[1:58:31] trip to louisiana no i didn't get
[1:58:34] lightning i didn't get thunder but we
[1:58:36] had a prayer meeting

[1:59:26] you don't feel the parts you got to look
[1:59:28] the part
[1:59:31] and i was sitting in the back i was
[1:59:32] going to sit in the back

[2:03:00] because i refuse to turn back i refuse
[2:03:04] to turn around
[2:03:06] we are christians and we believe
[2:03:10] god will do what he said he would
[2:03:14] do
[2:03:24] when god comes to your house he is
[2:03:26] prepared to fight the battle for
[2:03:28] you he is a great provider
[2:03:31] he is a healer he is not going to have
[2:03:34] to run back to his house to get more
[2:03:36] resources
[2:03:37] he's got everything that he's needed he
[2:03:40] has never failed
[2:03:41] he has never turned around he has never
[2:03:44] given up
[2:03:46] he knows what he's doing he is in
[2:03:48] control
[2:03:54] god is never overwhelmed
[2:03:58] he's got it
[2:04:01] he has got it don't you love the lord
[2:04:08] can i read you one more scripture
[2:04:12] he give a power to the faint
[2:04:22] and to them that have no might he
[2:04:24] increases strength
[2:04:30] you don't get might and power
[2:04:33] from things that are not of god
[2:04:37] i just want to say this to you the
[2:04:39] reason people are backslidden
[2:04:41] they don't spend their time with god
[2:04:46] you can't look at every nonsense of the
[2:04:48] world on your internet
[2:04:50] and expect your spirit to not be dirty
[2:04:57] are you with me then walk in here on
[2:04:59] saturday night and get your fix and say
[2:05:01] i'm fixed i'm all over again and then on
[2:05:03] monday be right in the same trashbot
[2:05:05] again
[2:05:06] [Applause]
[2:05:08] preaching to you i'm actually reading
[2:05:10] your spirit so here we are
[2:05:13] you cannot live in the realms of
[2:05:15] darkness
[2:05:16] all week long and expect a supernatural
[2:05:19] revival here on saturday and sunday
[2:05:21] morning
[2:05:25] you can't be a gamer six hours a day
[2:05:29] [Applause]
[2:05:30] and never read a scripture
[2:05:35] there's a reason your marriage is
[2:05:37] falling apart
[2:05:46] you know who that was for
[2:05:52] it's all right you get over it
[2:06:04] even the youth shelf shall faint
[2:06:07] and be weary and the young men
[2:06:11] shall utterly fall
[2:06:14] notice this next scripture but they that
[2:06:16] wait upon the lord
[2:06:21] don't get ahead of god wait on it
[2:06:25] i like it when god just tells you
[2:06:27] jonathan hey listen you don't have to be
[2:06:29] out
[2:06:30] front just follow me
[2:06:33] i make a good follower
[2:06:37] i make a really good follower there's so
[2:06:40] many times we want to tell god how to do
[2:06:42] it
[2:06:43] he's got it he's got it
[2:06:48] you just follow him he's got it just
[2:06:51] follow him he'll open the doors that
[2:06:53] need to be opened
[2:06:54] he'll close the doors and need to be
[2:06:56] closed
[2:06:59] come on church i'm with him
[2:07:03] but they that wait upon the lord shall
[2:07:06] renew their strength
[2:07:08] and they shall mount up with wings as an
[2:07:10] eagle
[2:07:11] they shall run and not be weary they
[2:07:14] shall walk
[2:07:16] and not faint
[2:07:21] help me lord help me lord
[2:07:27] to wait
[2:07:43] in the scriptures that talk about
[2:07:44] rapture which we're right in front of
[2:07:48] there's a couple of scriptures that i
[2:07:49] want to bring to you that
[2:07:51] will help you this morning
[2:07:58] verse 9 of first time thessalonians 4
[2:08:02] says but it's touching brotherly love
[2:08:08] you need not that i write unto you for
[2:08:10] yourselves are
[2:08:11] taught of god to love one another
[2:08:17] and indeed you do it toward all brethren
[2:08:22] which are in all macedonia
[2:08:25] but you but we beseech you brethren
[2:08:30] that you increase more and more
[2:08:34] now this is a powerful scripture and i
[2:08:36] read it to sister connie this week and
[2:08:38] you know sometimes you just preach to
[2:08:40] her
[2:08:42] homer would preach to nancy
[2:08:47] and i'm and i preached the connie
[2:08:51] and if the boys will sit still i'll
[2:08:52] preach to them
[2:09:00] now i want you to read this next verse
[2:09:02] with me
[2:09:06] because this is going to do you some
[2:09:07] real good
[2:09:11] and that you studied to be quiet
[2:09:19] oh god help us
[2:09:24] and do your own business
[2:09:28] [Laughter]
[2:09:31] somebody just put their hands together
[2:09:33] and say yeah this is for this church
[2:09:44] you know sometimes god's word just makes
[2:09:46] your smile
[2:09:48] if you mind your home business you won't
[2:09:51] be mind and mind
[2:10:01] study to be quiet it's
[2:10:04] an art
[2:10:08] it's a gift
[2:10:11] if america could get the scripture
[2:10:16] just quiet yourself down
[2:10:23] and do your own business
[2:10:28] and to work with your own hands
[2:10:36] oh glory oh glory
[2:10:40] oh glory i could get on the soapbox
[2:10:42] right here just for a few minutes
[2:10:43] brother vernon you'd love it
[2:10:45] you'd like it you like it
[2:10:52] you know i'm not smart i'm not smart
[2:10:58] and i'm no politician
[2:11:01] but if you take people in and you tell
[2:11:05] them to go home and don't work
[2:11:07] and give them 900 a week they ain't
[2:11:10] gonna won't go back to work
[2:11:15] [Music]
[2:11:22] you give them 900 to stay home they
[2:11:24] ain't gonna go back
[2:11:27] you mean i gotta go back and sweep
[2:11:29] floors and put up with human beings and
[2:11:32] i gotta go back and sweat i gotta leave
[2:11:35] my tv
[2:11:36] and i gotta leave my games and i gotta
[2:11:38] leave my house
[2:11:40] oh no i'm scared
[2:11:48] that's kind of what's going on in
[2:11:50] churches all across america
[2:11:53] you knew i was going somewhere you might
[2:11:55] as well just come with me
[2:11:59] whether it was your favorite preacher
[2:12:00] this pastor or whoever it was
[2:12:04] that was sending you into your homes and
[2:12:06] you were sitting there in your golden
[2:12:08] slippers
[2:12:10] and sipping your hot chocolate you
[2:12:12] didn't have to change
[2:12:13] clothes and you were sitting there
[2:12:15] eating roast beef while the sermon was
[2:12:18] going on
[2:12:19] preach it andrew preach it andrew
[2:12:23] [Applause]
[2:12:29] and andrew doing some real good
[2:12:31] preaching right there honey and you're
[2:12:32] doing some good preaching
[2:12:36] but it comes to time the honeymoon's
[2:12:38] over and you gotta get yourself up
[2:12:43] and you gotta go to church and you gotta
[2:12:46] put your hands together
[2:13:02] you see covet was a test
[2:13:07] there's more more stuff coming oh yeah
[2:13:10] there's more stuff coming there's a lot
[2:13:13] more stuff coming
[2:13:15] there's wars coming there's pestilence
[2:13:18] coming
[2:13:20] but if you couldn't live right in your
[2:13:22] own little house with your token applied
[2:13:29] you know what they're saying now more
[2:13:31] people had affairs
[2:13:33] while that went on
[2:13:41] more people had affairs while covet went
[2:13:44] on
[2:13:45] than any other time amazing in it
[2:13:50] because you are what you are when you're
[2:13:52] by yourself
[2:13:54] [Music]
[2:13:56] i'm preaching to you
[2:13:59] are you with me now i want to go back to
[2:14:02] the original scripture
[2:14:05] that i came to
[2:14:10] the devil knew who he was fooling with
[2:14:13] when he came to my house
[2:14:17] when he called me out into the road
[2:14:21] and said we're looking for ron spencer
[2:14:24] and i said i'm he i'm the man
[2:14:29] i'm the man
[2:14:32] i will serve god though he slayed me
[2:14:36] i'll serve him
[2:14:42] are you with me the blindness hasn't
[2:14:46] left me
[2:14:46] but i'm still serving him
[2:14:50] i am standing in a paradox as andrew
[2:14:53] preached last night it was prophetic
[2:14:54] sermon
[2:14:56] they still say i've got brain cancer and
[2:14:58] they still say i've got lung cancer
[2:15:01] i'm taking double the medicine but i
[2:15:03] choose a different attitude
[2:15:10] the cancer didn't change the medicine
[2:15:12] didn't change only got worse
[2:15:16] but it was when i recognized who i was
[2:15:19] that's what made the change
[2:15:25] [Music]
[2:15:29] are you with me
[2:15:32] you say brother ron why would you be
[2:15:33] honest and tell us that there's a lot of
[2:15:36] people behind that camera
[2:15:40] that are listening they're fighting
[2:15:42] cancer and all kind of conditions
[2:15:45] and feel so defeated because of the
[2:15:47] trials that they're in
[2:15:49] i want you to remember saints just
[2:15:51] remember who you are
[2:15:54] and say i am he
[2:15:57] and if god be for me who can be against
[2:16:02] me
[2:16:03] [Music]
[2:16:10] i don't know what your trials are
[2:16:12] because i've fought some enemies this
[2:16:14] morning i don't know what your trials
[2:16:15] are
[2:16:16] i don't know what you're going through i
[2:16:18] can't fight your battle for you

[2:16:56] in victory mode

[2:18:48] message will get you ready for a rapture
[2:18:50] and god wants to live on the inside of
[2:18:52] you and he
[2:18:53] is greater than every devil that you
[2:18:55] will ever face in your life

[2:19:04] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:19:08] [Applause]
