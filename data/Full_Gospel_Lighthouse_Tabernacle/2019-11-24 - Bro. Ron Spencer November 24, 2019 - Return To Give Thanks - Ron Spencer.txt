of it and so we just thank God for His amazing sacrifice for us and we thank God for that this evening we have a card here I want to share with you there are certain people we think in our prayers for things that we appreciate so but try as we may we sometimes can't say the words that we want them to know there are people often who often go out of their way to pitch in when there's work to be done they show understanding and lighten our problems they help us in more ways than one there are certain people that we thank you for in our prayers and one of these people is you and this comes to say may God bless you forever for all that you so thoughtfully do I think some of those cards are so wonderful the way that they put it brother Ron brother Andrew but the Matthew and brothers and sisters

Kelly brother Kelly's quite a wonderful speaker he's been here for I don't know how many years now what would you what would you guess be 12 12 15 years maybe and you know I you know there's some guys that you just like their atmosphere and it's kind of guy brother Williams the kind of guy that you you just feel like you just be right at home havin having coffee and donuts with and so I've been doing that for a lot of years with him and so I have found it when you see and preach you you can't hardly see that he was once a trapper on a trapline and uses snowmobiles and sleeping out there and his sub-zero weather through the wind and well we just love him and sister Maura and they've been just really really wonderful friends I I can I can take you back and it was in 2003 that brother Harold Hildebrandt we were going to church and he said I I have a cousin and his name's Kelly and he's come to the meeting and he really needs a friend and I said dude he said yeah he said he'll probably be the only one that quite looks like he has he said it's got dark rimmed glasses and he's tall and he's dark headed and he said he needs a friend and I said well I'll make him a good friend he didn't know me at that time but I I met him after service and we spoke and and then it began to bill from that you know friendship says uh you know there's a there's a two-way thing you have to be to be a friend or to have a friend you got to be a friend a man you said well brother Ron I I'd like to I'd like to have more friends in my life well you you got to put some work into it and so so we're just so thankful that we can have friends like you and have a like this that he wants to come so many years in a row and we don't take it for granted something else I don't take for granted and this is where I was going with all of that I'd like for you to pray that we have somewhat decent weather next week and so he'll be flying in on Friday night and and as you're hearing the stories are that there's there's weather that isn't going to be in the United States and gonna mess up travel I just pray that God watches over those planes and gets those planes here and so I just pray that that goes wailing and then for our meeting next week harder I I don't know if I'm ready for the snow yet sister Connie hasn't put out any let it's no signs yet so so maybe she's waiting on it for a little while and so amen god bless you and I pray that you have a wonderful Thanksgiving and so that's what that's what I want to wish here this evening a man if you will turn with me in your scriptures to Luke chapter 17 and verse 11 I'd like to speak you to you tonight on return to give thanks return to give things 17 and verse 11 of Luke and it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee and he entered into a certain village and there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off and they lifted up their voices and said Jesus master have mercy on us probably their only chance in life and opportunities come will you take advantage of it and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed now notice this and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back with a loud voice and glorified God and fell down on his face on his feet giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan and Jesus answering said were not were not ten cleansed but where are the nine there are not found that returned to give glory to God save the stranger and he said unto Him arise and go thy way the faith has made the whole let's pray this evening may be of a need and I know there's a lot of sickness that has went through and let's just pray that God would just touch our lives this afternoon amen Almighty God you see our hands all over this building and many great needs has already been read across this audience tonight I ask you that you would send your word and heal Lord I believe that you can come to a Pew I remember sitting in a pew many years ago when you came and heal my lungs while I sit and listen to the Word of God you're the same God tonight I asked her tonight that you would anoint the words that we have studied this week and prepared I ask you that you would anoint this audience we thank you for what you did here last night and Lord what you've done today and tomorrow Lord and minister to our hearts we pray in Jesus Christ's name we pray a man and a man and a man you may be seated I found the statement pretty interesting this week a man named Winston Churchill stood and he was given a speech and he says you have enemies good that means that you stood up for something some time in your life it's quite a statement in it Thanksgiving is an American holiday Canadian as well they have there's a little bit earlier than we do it's an American holidays by for us is here and we sure to enjoy it it's a time to stop and give thanks for what he's done for us over the year that we have had in our audience we've had some pretty incredible things that have taken place births of babies that have happened we've had some to go on to be with the Lord and and in in in that sometimes we go well that was a great loss to us but we must remember that's not goodbye it is only a temporary separation because God provided them a new body that they could step into men like brother Ralph and brother Ted Hensley went to be with the Lord this year and and they stepped from this realm to that drill man and God rich in His mercy would come and begin to heal our hearts and touch us as an audience we've got new faces that are among us brother John's sons that have came to be with us and God's blessed them to be here and we we welcome them as as a part of our body amen were functioning body and all of us have different things and different gifts in our lives and and if you're new here we'd like to say welcome and thank you for being here and so we come into this Thanksgiving season we we just thank God for what he's done there's new homes that have been built new cars that are being driven we've went through some some heartaches and we've we've had some tests in their lives we've seen new jobs take place we've got teachers that have taken spots and and Lawyer this taking spots and jobs has been given families have been touched and and and we must we must stop and thank God for everything you know sometimes we will allow things to happen and things go on in their lives and if we're not careful God would do incredible things and in his and incredible things that he does if we're not careful we'll take it for granted or feel like we're entitled to it or he with me but without God we wouldn't have the oxygen to breathe without God the even the abilities in our life that he has given us in a natural room we wouldn't have the strength to do for us we've we've welcomed brother Greg's family here to be a part of us and they have moved and moved into the schools system and jobs has taken place as I was preparing and looking over this the last couple of weeks I I thought about an event that kind of from which I give great things for I think it was on May the 11th if I've got my date right maybe don't have it right but I I put it on the calendar on May the 11th I I got up with a very uneasy feeling and I just felt like tragedy was just right in front of me and and it just felt like you ever wake up with the moment maybe it's never happened to you but you just you just know that troubles headed your way and you don't know what to do about her what to think about it and I was Saturday and I was preparing to speak and and as I was as I was preparing to speak I I just wrote it down before service that tragedy was right in front of us and I wrote it down and I'm just praying that God will divert that tragedy and whenever I have a vision or have a dream of significance or something like that I'll give sister Connie I'll write it down I'll give sister Connie that it would be a two-fold witness that it will take place and so I give sister Connie that note and actually gave it to her before service and that as it would be that she would take that note and if you remember she had some candies for the children I believe after service and and I was finishing the service and just something came to me as I was finishing the service I stepped out and I said I want to have prayer of her that note and I told sister Connie to bring it and she actually had to go get her pocketbook somewhere another she brought it down and you know we it would seem like sometimes you feel like at the end of the service well what are you holding for a few extra moments well sometimes those extra moments take their real price has just set real still for just a few moments it'll be alright and so so anyway we brought the note down and I prayed for that note I didn't tell you what was on that note but I prayed over that note and because you know I can't have you anxious as well as me but I placed it into the hands of a God that that that had tomorrow on his mind now you know we're thankful for what he has done here's where I'm going with this tonight we're thankful for what he has done but little do we sometimes appreciate that he's paving the way for tomorrow he's already got your tomorrow mapped out and he's making a way for you and so just within matter of a day brother Jason was working in a about a 20 foot ditch in a 20 foot deep hole in a concrete bunker and and he's there and he's at the bottom and he's doing I don't understand the work and I'm just gonna do the best that I can and he's and he's concreting a pipe together if I'm right and just something moves on him to get out and get new concrete and he said literally within seconds of being out of the hole down the down the the pipe stream a man busted a huge line and that huge hole that he was working in 20 foot deep was now gushing with water that's something that caused him to get out of that hole that's something that's something that you can't explain that warm presence that comes in your room and you just know I'm not alone no more you just know that something's got ahold of my life and and I'm not the only one here you can't explain it you can't define it you just know that God's watching over the seed so in turn we didn't have a funeral here but we can have a family Thanksgiving hallelujah I'm really grateful for that you don't know how many times I've looked at that note hey man maybe I need to send you a copy of that you can have that and hold it away somewhere I'm a little bit sentimental along those lines those things mean a lot to me brother William and sister Gabrielle moved here I believe two years ago or year and a half ago she's with child they're building up a beautiful home for those of you that drive 340 and you see this this house going up I don't know particularly what they lived in in Alabama was that Alabama I don't know what you lived in in Alabama but I believe that's a step up that's a really nice piece of property and we know that's just God's blessings on your life and for that week thanks give God thanks sister Gabrielle's father came to the Lord just just weeks before the meeting and and I witnessed sister Gabrielle hugging her father something that been a long time coming and then I was sent a picture this last week of her brother sitting in the seat with her father and that's been a long time coming won't you just stop for just a moment and say thank you God for your blessings on me hallelujah could you just now just stop for a second and say father I want to thank you this would be a different service but I want to thank you I'd like to be the one that the other nine they got healed and they just went their own way and took it for granted but I'd like to be the one to return to bow at your feet and say thank you this nation was founded and somewhere around 1620 I I've looked at a couple of different things could be 16 20 21 but a man named William Bradford is the man that gets credit for celebrating the first Thanksgiving at Plymouth Rock they came to America or this new land bringing a hundred and two people to to come and settle a village and make it like Europe and have streets and houses like there was in Europe there was others that had already came after one year 47 of their brothers and sisters had died ending wars sicknesses and plagues and situations accidents had happened and now 47 of their own brethren have died but God prepared something well before that they would even be in this situation only a few years before there there was a man an Indian boy named Squanto that was taken capture as a boy because they had preparations that they needed an interpreter and so they had taught him English and then they took him to Europe and he became a master at speaking English and into his mastery of speaking English he they sent him back to America to be able to solve some situations and he went back to his own land to where he was at into his own village and and they heard that there was a new village that was not doing well and and they'd had some Wars and he went to this village meeting a man named William Bradford and he began to speak with him being eloquent in English as an as an Indian boy he brought peace he brought a a peace treaty between the white man and the Indians that lasted 50 years I like fur cool Squanto to go to Washington today I'd really like for that to go to Washington today and he could and he could settle some things I think people need some of that in their own families but Squanto had become a Christian and even been a Christian he became a peacemaker and he went to this residue of people that had died and people that had been buried their dead and now hundred and two it came 47 had perished and he began to teach them about how to raise corn and how to plant in how to use fish for fertilizer and he began to teach them and and then the year would pass in the next year they got a bountiful crop and William Bradford said we need to stop and thank God for what he's done for us now you see God provided them before they ever landed in America he provided them a boy that would become a Christian now this boy would would suffer hardship he would die the year later in 1622 as a boy an injury that would take place fever would happen in Hindman and he would perish but in his young life whether you have ever heard his name or not hem he's ever heard the name Squanto teachers and children all over the building raising their hands and making me look like a nut but squee would have no flag if it wasn't for a guy like this but a God prepared him because he was watching over his seat and you said well what does this have to do with the message of an hour sermon let me just say this nation was going to have a prophet in it he was going to send the seventh angel to this nation and we would need to be birthed and to be born and to raise up as to thank God thank God and remember it's God that has established us that's when a nation fails when she forgets who God is and they gathered their there they gathered their fruit and they and that first that first year William Bradford gave each one their five seeds of corn as a remembrance of where they had came from I think sometimes that's something we ought to do as our own thoughts remember what we came from I'm not out of line here Psalms 100 we spoke last week and the scripture said make a joyful noise unto the Lord all you lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing and know ye that the Lord he is God and four-hit is he that hath made us and not we ourselves I think that's something we always ought to remember not we ourselves we are his people and sheep of his pasture enter into his gates with Thanksgiving so Thanksgiving is every service and into his courts with praise and be thankful unto Him and bless his name for the Lord is good his mercy is everlasting it is truth endure through all generations Colossians chapter 3 and verse 12 says put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies and kindness and humbleness of mind meekness and long-suffering forbearing one another forgiving one another forgiveness will heal you if any man have a quarrel against even if any even as Christ forgave you so also do you as a Christian you must understand problems are going to come but then it's your opportunity to practice forgiveness verse 14 and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your hearts first of all come to peace with yourself to the which also ye are called in one body and be a thankful let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and in hymns and spiritual songs seven singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord and whatsoever you do in word or dude deed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father by him 1st Thessalonians 5 and verse 14 now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feeble-minded support the weak and paste it toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men rejoice evermore pray without ceasing notice these next words in everything I just can't I just can't get I just can't find joy I just can't find happiness here is a king and everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you proverbs chapter 27 and verse 1 this is a I want you to just look at this one right here this is a powerful Scripture this goes to last night service and after last night this one found its way in the tech and the text for tonight boast not thyself of tomorrow are you with me so many people are planning tomorrow next week next year and not taking the time today to enjoy the moment that you're in are you with me I'd say this to young married couples older married couples enjoy one another don't live a selfish life enjoy one another go ahead tell her you love her right there where you're at there's some people sitting in the building would like to tell their mate that I think we're ten to zero ten widows no widowers so that shows you men stay on your toes we're not going to outlive them I spoke with Mike at Ciro's last night he was asking about how sister Nancy's doing and I said all she doing good I said her mother's 90 97 98 years old I said she's still she's still doing well I said has good days and bad days I said my wife's doing great I might be dead in two years she's gonna live forever nobody's promise tomorrow nobody's promised tomorrow oh but I'm going to do this tomorrow really sometimes tomorrow don't come but what about today what about the moments that you're in the time with your family that you've got an opportunity to be with thank God for that moment whew a few months ago I preached to you brother Branham who said he said if I had the opportunity if I had a room completely full of gold I would exchange that for an hour with my daddy his daddy's done went on but I would exchange all of that with an hour with my daddy I understand that I understand that I get to missing my father and I get to missing brother Homer and there's days that I just get to missing there I'm sorry there's just days that I'd like to have a conversation with them you get to missing your loved ones well that recipe is I can't have that but I can't have this moment so we must enjoy one another that's more than just marriages but that's as a group of people sitting here are you with me well I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that and I'm going to I'm going to build my business or I'm gonna build my home or I'm gonna do the all of this you've got all of this plans and maybe it don't happen most that not ourself of tomorrow for thou knowest not a day may bring forth now here's a powerful statement let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth boy that could be read to Laodicea that could be read to lay out a seal this self-seeking age that everything's about themselves let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth a stranger and not thine own lips a stone is heavy in a sand weighty but a fools wrath is heavier than them both I'd like to say I'm thankful for Jesus Christ I don't know about you but he changed my life I was asked this afternoon how - what do we define an experience by and my reply was how do we define an experience how do we tell somebody else our experience how do we illustrate it to somebody else how do we can it how do we preserve it how do we bring somebody else into our experience all I know is it's when it happened to me in a few moments I went from one person to another all I know is in this moment I was this way and when he came when I came on the other side of that moment I was this way I know this when I took Andrew to British Columbia Andrew was a certain way in his life but when we brought him home he was a complete different boy are you with me in the same weekend brother joel ray was a certain way when he came to that meeting but when he went home he was a complete different boy same Jesus and all I know is before before Jesus came into my life I was a wreck I was like a lot of you I was a wreck and I thank God that he came and changed my lives my father listens to tapes every every every morning every afternoon and every night it's his thing to do he gets up in the morning at 6 o'clock and turns on the tape recorder I don't stay there when reason being at 6 o'clock in the morning brother branham sounding on a bullhorn I'm just not ready for it quite yet and it's lovely he's got used to doing it and he's alone so he turns on brother branham and and he catches some of it because most times when I call him I'm waking him up and I'll ask him I said what do you get it what did you get out of the tape because if not careful you'll you'll listen to a sermon or listen to a tape an and will go well I've heard that one before I've heard the rapture I've heard it 50 times or a hundred times or 102 but what did you get today and so when he tells me what I just listened to kind of like what parents do how was your day what did you what was he taught what did you eat for lunch and I simply trying to keep dad's mind young and stirred I asked him I said well what did you hear well I heard I heard things that are to be what did God speak to you today that you caught and he to tell me a couple of different sentences that became alive to him I think if we ever get to the spot to where we walk in this church and we sat down and we hear the songs and when we listen to the ministry and we don't get anything it means that we wasn't ready and it's not the singers and it's not the preachers fault and it's definitely not God's fault but I want to be ready I read this to you some time ago and I want to read it again because it just meant so much to me this week when I begin to think about what a change that he made in my life what a change this message has made in my life I heard this when I was in Germany from a brother from South Africa and eroded him and got this from him and he said he came from the bosom of the Father to the bosom of a woman he put on humanity that we might put on divinity he became a son of man that we might become sense of God he came from heaven where rivers never freeze winds never blow frost never chills the air flowers never fade and no one has ever sick there's no Undertaker's and there's no graveyards and no one ever dies and no one is ever buried he is born contrary to the laws of nature he lived in poverty he was reared in obscurity he crossed the boundary of land once in childhood and he had no wealth nor influence neither training nor formal education his relatives were inconspicuous and influential in infancy he startled the king and boy hid he puzzled wise men and land hood he ruled the course of nature he walked up on bull bellows in hutch the seat asleep He healed multitudes without medicine and made no charge for his services he never wrote a book yet all the libraries of the country could not hold the books that were been written about him he never sent wrote a song yet he furnished the theme of more songs than all the songwriters combined he never found at a college yet all schools together cannot boast of as many students as he has he never practiced psychology psychiatry psychiatry and yet he healed more broken hearts then doctors have healed broken bodies he never marshaled alarming drafted a soldier fired a gun yet no leader has had more volunteers who have under his orders made rebel stack arms of surrender without a shot being fired he is the star of astronomy the rock of geology the line and that and the lamb of zoology he is the harmonizer of all discord Zinn the healer of all diseases great men have come and gone yet the lives of on Herod could not kill him Satan could not seduce him death could not destroy him the grave could not hold him he laid aside purple robes of royalty for a peasant's down he was rich yet for our sake became poor ask the wise men he slept in another man's manger he cruised the lake in in in another man's boat he rode on another man's donkey he was buried in another man's poo all men have failed but he never failed he is known as the perfect one he is the chief among 10,000 he is the wonderful and the merciful and he is my Savior he is incomparable I call him God Philippians 2 and verse 7 said but he made of himself a no reputation and he took upon him the form of a servant he was made a likeness of man and being found in a fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God hath also highly exalted him and give him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father I would like to say he's incomparable in his love in Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 2 and walk in love as Christ hath loved us and had given himself for us an offering in the sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling Savior no one ever had grace like he did no one forgive me nobody had grace like he had second Corinthians chapter 8 in verse 9 for you know that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor they get through his private REE became rich sacrifice as Andrew preached last night for even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many brother on that's old news really because you can't pay for your own sins his power I'd like to say to you tonight it's incomparable Jesus would say it all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth I'd like to say this to you even when he held his peace his quietness was powerful when Kings asked him to show him a miracle he refused to clown for him when he was standing there he knew who he was he know what he was sent to do and yet he would say my kingdom is not of this world he could have called ten thousand angels but because of you because of me he held himself yet we live in a nation that says I don't need God we live in a nation where the Ten Commandments is no longer welcome in our judicial system or in our school and we rant and rave about that but what about your home are you with me we can be political and say we need prayer back in schools and prayer back in churches prayer back in this when I go home what about your life what about your dedication be there feel thankful first timothy verse 6 and verse 13 i give the charge in the sight of God who quickeneth all things and for Christ Jesus is standing for for Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession that thou keep this commandment without spot unreviewable under the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and the only Payton potentate king of kings and Lord of lords oh yeah I shared this with some friends this week and I share it with you thinking about Thanksgiving there's a person that I have that I have admired in my Christian experience through the decades that I've served the Lord and that was a person named Corey Tim boom she was an individual that was her they were actually became the Underground Railroad of of Europe to be able to try to rescue as many Jews as they could rescue and they did by the tens of thousands and to get them to safety and then they were arrested and taken to the to the to the concentration camps and in those horrible concentration camps she would lose her father and she would have to stand and watch her sister be destroyed she would give testimony she would be a pauper here in America she would be used by Billy Graham and other great evangelists as a testimony of the saving grace of Jesus Christ and the power of forgiveness and she said that one thing that caused her to be able to survive the concentration camps was daily forgiveness in her eighties she had never owned a home but she was given a new home a very nice home in California they gave her a Holman and a young preacher was there to visit with her and and he began to talk to this elderly lady and he began to talk to her about how good God's been to you lately how good God's been to you now that he's given you a home and she stopped him short seeing his ignorance and his shortsightedness and she said Sonny Boy God was good to me in the concentration camps he's always been good to me at this point I want to say this to you I'm walking on ledge that doctors told me I would never walk anymore I was hit by lightning things could have turned out different to different strokes one would land me in a hospital for eight days and couldn't see the turn to the light but on the eighth day I led a nurse to the Lord Jesus Christ and after leading that nurse to the Lord Jesus Christ God healed my body and it was as though it never happened in the first place are you with me but the Kelly was visiting with us three years ago I had a heart attack the day brother Kelly was to arrive it took me to the hospital I was working I was working at the local recycle center with my boys and we were working and all the sudden it struck me I've never really been scared of anything in my life but I really want to say goodbye when it comes and all I knew that the pain in my chest that was happening I was not in control of and there was seemed to be a something that was coming over top of me as a young Mexican boy named Carlos that his kin to our sister back here and he quickly began to work on me and get me in his car and Matthew and them carried me to the car and and for the first time I life I felt that I felt the fear that went with it but I kept reminding myself that everything's going to be all right but the Kelly would come that night somewhere around 11 o'clock one of the boys went and picked them up and from the airport and picked them up and and I went to the I went to the I did a stress test the next morning and and and failed the stress test but I talked the doctors into letting me go home and so because I didn't want to stay I wanted to be here for the meeting and then and then we would go away for couple of days for brother Kelly and enjoy some company together and there's all kinds of things that was going on but somewhere between December the 6th and December around the 29th and went to dr. Luna and dr. Luna looked at all the tests and reruns some deaths and he said it's over he said there's no damage from what took place things could have been different things could have been different a fire took place and things could have been different they could have harvest my organs for this church things could have been a lot different I'd like to take a moment here when we think about when brother Timothy Pruett came and he talked about this audience and he was in the barn and told his daddy to come and daddy came and preached preach to services on God will have a testimony and God's Hall of Fame listen let me just say this to you God watched over us and prepared us I squat to God watched over our lives you see he's ahead of us God don't know time but he's ahead of us making a way for us seeing that I would need to be here tonight I needed to survive that brother Bisco would be anointed on my worst day in the coma to where doctors gave me up anointed to tell that I would be the speaker next year in the camp the speaker in the camp so I would survive and be the speaker so we get things Corey Tim Tim Boone says I'd like to give you five quotations many but these five spoke to me are you okay I know this is different tonight but I think it's very I think it's been beneficial to me this week and I feel it's beneficial to you you can never learn that Christ is all you need until Christ is all you have do you know what hurts so much so very much it's love love is the strongest force in the world and when it is blocked that means pain there are two things that we can do when this happens we can kill that love so that it stops hurting but then of course part of us dies too or we can ask God to open up another route for love to travel through she says today I know that so memories such memories are the key not to the past but to the future I know that experiences of our lives when we let God use them become mysterious and perfect preparation for the work that he will give us to do maybe our teachers would enjoy these quotations to be kept father in heaven knows when we're going to need things - I found this one incredible our wise father knows in heaven knows when we're going to need things do but don't get ahead of him love is larger than walls which shut it in even as angry vengeful thoughts ball through me and I thought of a woman in the concentration camp she could say some powerful words with this even as angry vengeful thoughts ball through me I saw the sin of them Jesus Christ died for this man was I going to ask for more Lord Jesus I prayed forgive me help me to forgive him Jesus I cannot forgive him give me your forgiveness and so I discovered that it's not on our forgiveness anymore then on on our for goodness that the world's healing hinges but on his when he tells us to love our enemies he gives along with the command the very love itself this is a good one if the devil cannot make us bad he will make us busy don't bother to give God instructions just report for duty put this one on your refrigerator for tomorrow don't bother to give God instructions just report further there I'll give you this last one there's several more then I'll give you this last one hold everything in your hands lightly otherwise it hurts when God price your fingers open that one that one I gave great thought to this week when Jesus was standing at last as his tomb he says something that all of us know that Jesus said Lazarus come forth but I want to read to you the prayer that he prays and then they took away the stone from the place were the Dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes notice these words and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me I thank you that you heard my prayer I think that would do us really good due diligence tonight I thank you that you heard my prayer but the brain says this he came by writing a lot of people said he's a healer all we've seen him open up the eyes of the blind we see him make the crippled walk we see him off for prayer and fever left the child but then those type were only following him for the loaves and the fishes and that's the way the crowds are today many if if there's a healer while they'll follow him he he's just in a way ASIS if they get sick they run and say oh oh will you please pray for me and the Lord Jesus will make them me well and as soon as they came out of the hospital or the spit bed right back to the world they'd go I'd like to bring that that quote to live to you when brother Holman was here there were a lot of people and brother Holman was a general but there was a lot of people when they got in trouble would run their brother Homer they didn't serve the Lord they'd come a few services in him gone when they got in trouble they'd come a few services and gone high up in a pastor a while now and if they didn't dad or they were way and run and and needed money they'd come to the Homer and brother home around the goodness of his heart would give them money and they was they would serve the Lord you know for a little flaw and then they were gone and after brother home and left the scene they came to me and I said that won't give you salvation and I saw your tricks for years I won't be here for you Jesus will always be him well Homer will get rewarded for all the great deeds that he did but those people were only using the gift and the man and not seeking for the eternal value don't let that be your case don't let that be in your case that might be a little bit strong but you might as well hear you might as well hear it you might as well know it I can't save you I can't pay all your debts but Jesus can fix your problems if you can get to Jesus not to the preacher I've heard all brother Harlow was here Jesus is here one day there will be a statement made all brother on was here but Jesus would still be here and after the rapture there's going to be people screaming off they were all here come on you can just reach with me now I'll relax and preach with me when the bride leaves you're going to want us to be here and in that day you're gonna say how wish shall I serve God with everything that was within me and I got rid of those things that kept me I don't really serving the Lord you're talking about real repentance why aren't they open the doors why aren't they here well what they have been preaching about changed their body and all what a face stiffened that's going to be hello oh what a Thanksgiving I have a quote to share with you we have a flag over here I've actually in in the

you open as an audience enjoy the moments that you have with your children your grandchildren with one another the only reason you should be screaming at one another is if there's a fire in your house old lady old manor hateful words should never come out of a Christians mouth I know these are elementary thoughts tonight you see you're a mentor to your children I don't want to say this I won't speak to you for a couple of weeks now but I want to leave you with this I found something interesting the other day other round picked up a pack of cigarettes and a pack of cigarettes he got a text thinking man's filter you haven't heard that go back and listen to it but I run across an interesting story the other day how many remembers that Marlboro Man Marlboro Man he was the Marlboro Man is for 12 years he was John Wayne's best friend it was a rancher he's a real man they came to him and asked him if he would do it and he obliged him he had a ranch he had children children as 12 years would go on now he never smoked cigarette he never smoked a cigarette in his life but he was there advertisement he was the face of their franchise and he got the job because he was best friends with John Wayne and John Wayne told the the people that he would make them but one day his children when he was telling them you never smoked or you never drink it'll destroy your life one day his children asked him a question then why do you advertise for them then that day he called them and told him said I quit I quit I can't be a mentor to my children I quit well brother on what's that got to do at the end of a service a message church service I'd like for you to look in the mirror whether it's your dress or your attitude your conduct or habits in your life and maybe you're a walking billboard for the wrong thing unintentionally you're the walking billboard for the wrong thing when you come to the realization this ain't going to be this way in heaven so I've been acquitted here if it ain't gonna be eternal I gotta quit it here whether it's hate or prejudice maybe it's just a priority of time of usurping God serving God is more than about it's the right recipe the thing to do it's about him living on the inside of you and he's the king of your heart he's the king of your heart maybe it's your dress and you said well brother on those things are difficult for me to give up for brother Kelly's mother it was her earrings was difficult but the Kelly will come and preach to you next week and he's going to wear a pin most likely he's been here the last couple of years in his opinion that will be there right there and that's made out of an ear ring his mother's ear ring and she held her ears the last time that I was there just before God did a work in her life and she said this is one thing I'll never give up and I just looked at her and I said I want to ask you something what earrings be so big would that be the one excuse that you would have to miss eternal love maybe it's not earrings for you to not what's that little thing oh what a Thanksgiving it would be if you could but that one thing I'm not gonna ask you to raise your hand but you were raised in a home with parents that were dealing with difficulties and they just that one thing if they could ever get across that hurdle you you would think that they would be much better off how many of you were raised in
