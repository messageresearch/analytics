and verse 7. First Peter chapter 1 and verse 7. this is going to hit home for everybody here so that the trial of your faith being much more precious than that of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found under the praise and honor and the glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ I want us all to read that together today that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found under the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ I want you to read it now that first sentence and I want you instead of your put my that the trial of my faith be in much more precious than that of gold that perishes amen let's just pray Lord Jesus we love you today we're so thankful father to be gathered together in your name if we were gathered under the name of a church it wouldn't mean much but were gathered together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ a name that is higher than every name a name that has been exalted above all the prophets of all the kings you are the king of kings and Lord of the Lords and what a day that it will be that when we all gather there to to be there to watch you be anointed king of kings I asked you today that you would speak to our hearts anoint us anoint the servant of the Lord and not only the servant of the Lord that speaks but also the hearer today we all stand here with many needs and we ask you that you'd meet them in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen you may be seated your mind I want to remind you of Who You Are the whole world is God's the heaven the heavens of heavens is the Lord's and he reigneth Among The Children of Men but of those who he hath chosen whom he hath purchased to himself he saith what he's saith not of others but he calls you my people won't you say that there I am his people in this word it is an idea a proprietorship he owns us in a special manner the Lord's portion is his people Jacob is the lot of his inheritance all the nations upon the Earth are his the whole world is in his power yet are his people his chosen more especially his possession for he hath done more for them than others I love that don't you he has brought he has bought them with his blood he has brought them not to himself he has set his great heart upon them he has loved them with an everlasting love a love which hath Waters that cannot be quenched which hath Revolutions of time and never to suffice in the least degree his love will never diminish that's how much he loves you just in case the enemy told you this morning you're nothing why don't you remind your enemy I'm God's chosen people I wrote this to my family yesterday and I'll share it since you're my family I'll share it with you as the Lord would lay these words upon my heart and I'll read the text again that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found under the praise and the honor and the glory of the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ Psalms 23 and verse 4 yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with all in my cup runneth over James chapter 1 and verse 12 blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord has promised to them that love him let no man say what he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot do be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man my thoughts for the that yesterday as I awake Satan went before my God and said Ron will turn and run In the Heat of the trial and God thought I have confidence in the seed that's on the inside of him I know it because I placed it there [Music] have at it have at it was God's response so here we are three years later as I awake again to take chemo for the day good days bad days feeling like the flu has taken over my body every day run no because every day is a miracle let's enjoy every day that we live God is greater than every problem that we have we shall not whine we shall not complain or become a slave to cancer or any problem that we have we shall come forth as gold we shall live in Victory I declare to you today as a victory Hallelujah with Jesus on our side we shall not lose I love you all I say this to all of you I love you all never take a moment for granted sometimes we get and I'll just add this sometimes we get to the point to think well this is the way it's always going to be and we've we've kind of came to church and we think well brother Ron and brother Andrew and these guys are going to always be here when we don't realize that next week could be different are you with me one bad day can change the whole scene of things so every day should be enjoyed you say we're brother Ron but you don't know my troubles if you quit whining and look up if you'll just stop your whining and look up and quit complaining just enough to you can get some victory before you can have a trial now just think about this before you can have a trial the enemy has wept before the father and said I I can't get to him I can't touch a hair of his head will you give me permission will you give me permission to get into where he's at that's how protected that you are a seed of God and before God gives the devil permission to put you in a trial he has confidence in you that you'll make it through it that's quite a statement but it's the truth Satan can't touch a hair of your head he can't touch a hair of your head until God has given permission to do it Hallelujah you love the Lord isn't he good the scripture said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover are you with me the scripture tells us that these signs shall follow them that believe in my name you'll cast out devils they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover a Believer is one who acts on the word of God so in our trials we will act like Sons and Daughters of God I want you to get these first opening statements God never asked us to do something that he won't do his self are you with me he never asked us to do something he will not over ask you to do anything listen he won't put on anything on you that you can't bear you say brother Ron but I'm just feel like giving up good now you can let Jesus do something because when you give up you realize he's got a hope because you were to give up a long time ago you didn't give up a long time ago had it not been for God holding on to your hands God asked Lord to build an ark because God was going to flood the Earth Moses stretched out a rot and then God parted the waters Joshua marched around the walls of Jericho and God pushed them down Elijah smote the waters and God parted them God will do his part whether on but God feels like a million miles away you don't know what he's carrying you Alaska threw a stick in the river and God made Iron to swim Naaman dipped in the water seven times and then God healed him of leprosy Jesus said lay hands on the sick it is God that will heal them no man heals nobody we just take God at his work we simply take God in his word and God will do his work don't you worry the sun will come up tomorrow the moon will come up tonight it's a promise of God are you with me now brother on the whole world's dependent on me oh no look in the mirror you can't hardly depend on yourself the oxygen that you just breathed when it goes out of your nostril says Jehovah God so even the greatest atheists in the world just by breathing they breathe the Breath of God we couldn't do anything without God Amen brother Ron but I'm an atheist get ready to die in your moments when you realize that the wrong one is opening the door you wish you had Jesus many have said it there are no atheists in a foxhole when you realize that hell is real just look up famous last words it's an easy lookup go to Google famous last words and you will find that people that did not believe in God in those last seconds begin to say hell is real listen we ought to know it's real because Jesus talked more about hell than he talked about heaven because he was here to save the world you don't have to go to hell you're lost today you don't have to go to hell God don't send you to hell say it with me God's not sending nobody to hell you gotta across the blood of Jesus Christ your salvation is paid for Give the Lord a great big hand right there Proverbs chapter 3 sister Linda your favorite scriptures trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not to thine own understanding and all thy ways acknowledge Him and He will direct thy path be not wise and though not thine own eyes and fear the lord and depart from evil it shall be held to thy navel and Morrow to thy bones honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruit of all thine increase so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy process shall burst out new wine my son despise not the chastening of the Lord neither be weary of his correction for whom the Lord loveth he correcteth aren't you glad of that even as the Father the Son in whom he delighteth happiest the man that findeth wisdom and the man that giveth understanding brother on but I'm in a trial I want you to understand your trial is not the goal cancer Is Not Gold that I'm fighting Abraham was asked by God after 25 years of waiting on the promise to be fulfilled listen his trial was not leaving him his trial was not not enough grass his trial was not I'm too rich or I'm too poor or I've got too many people with me his trial was not Sarah and Hagar having issues all the time his trial was not Ishmael but his greatest trial was when God asked him to do something that he was going to do himself take thy son thy only son take thy son thine only son up to the Mount Moriah up to where Jehovah Jireh was going to meet him and offer him as a sacrifice don't tell Sarah don't tell the others no doubt as Isaac asked him we have the wood we have the fire but we don't have a sacrifice and then the trial of your faith the trial of your faith was now get ready to put on Abraham had to have faith God gave him to me and I was a dead man and I could not have him and if I If I sacrifice him before the Lord God that gave him to me when I was dead will raise him back to life the faith was in the resurrection it wasn't in his wine and it wasn't I'm going to have to take my son up it wasn't in all them having all my trouble with a lot and I'm having all my trouble listen that's just life brother Ron but I'm having so much trouble it's called l-i-f-e right and we're all living life you have a flat tire change it you burn the biscuits make more you forgot to make up your bed come in make it up turn it up get back in it your clothes stink why stem I'm hungry go to Hardis it's life I don't like my job get another one don't live in prison my husband don't love me you married him best day man of the day [Music] Joseph was in prison for quite a long time but his faith was in division his faith was in the dream he could pity party about what his brothers did to him but it was a part of getting him where he had to get are you with me they could tell he's dead they could they could show a bloody coat it was all part of the story but the dream the vision was what he had faith in living in prison was a tough thing being lied on was a tough thing but he didn't have faith his trial was not being in prison come on Church the trial of his faith was hanging on to the dream I want to ask you through all of your ups and downs is your faith in the promise brother on my friend died this one died I got some real news for you without the rapture you're going to you're going to don't be scared of it it's your Uber don't be scared of it but if you live a life that will get you to where you need to go you don't have to be afraid and then what will come forth is pure goal at the end of the day [Applause] the resurrection will bring you back to life oh ain't it good brother Brandon said when when I once was in his presence and I realized that there was somebody who loved me he loved the unlovable there was somebody that loved me when nobody else loved me there was somebody who cared for me no one else cared for me you ever have the devil tell you that nobody loves you am I the only person in the room he whispers in your ear nobody loves you nobody cares for you I walk out of church sometimes and they go what a flop that was and the enemy's just in my ear boy you flopped you studied for a couple of weeks and you absolutely flopped and it's then I realized that that's probably when it was at the best [Applause] you ever sit in church and the enemy battled in your mind the whole time why we must be in the right crowd here battled in your mind the whole and then next week all the sudden sentences from these sermons come back in your ear so all the enemy did for an hour and a half trying to battle you while the preacher was going for it you're so quiet you're so caught it and God reminds you over and over and over again of what the stupid devil loses again [Applause] brother Birmingham said I put my arms around his cross I embraced it to me and me and become one then me and him become one then and from then on I loved him he stayed he stained my bosom and my heart with his blood by touching me and forgiving my sins I'm happy tonight to be one of his I Echo these thoughts I never desire to leave his Heavenly place though the tempter to to persuade me oft has tried but I'm safe in God's Pavilion happy in his love and grace I'm living on the Hallelujah side makes you feel like singing glory be to Jesus that the hallelujahs rule that's why Andrew and Matthew are the song leaders being confident in this very thing I love this that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ can you read it with me now you don't know where it's at Philippians chapter 1 and verse 6. sorry I didn't announce it you're not a mind reader your husband thinks you are he wants gravy and biscuits and you give him poached eggs I bet you've never had poached eggs I want you to read this with me being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ how many looked up to the sun this morning is there a half a sun up there when you looked at the Moon last night it was beautiful was there a half a moon up there when you look at these beautiful mountains is there half mountains up there when he grows your grass you're getting the point when he's growing apples on a tree does he give you a half an apple he won't do that for you he don't start out working on you and then just dust his hands and say that's enough he [Applause] will finish the work you may have to go through a lot of chapters in your life that seem disappointed but he don't just close the book after a few disappointing chapters he knows what's at the end of your book You're Going To Rule and reign with him on the earth you're going to live in a body that will never age we'll never have a turmoil we'll never know what time is you are Eternal in his mind [Applause] Proverbs chapter 17 and you don't have to find this this is in the passion translation in the same way that gold and silver are refined by fire the Lord purifies your heart by the test and trials now you see before you came here you never had a trial when you was in his mind Satan couldn't get to you I want to give you a News Bulletin once you die or you're raptured the devil can't get to you so he's only got a space of time to work are you getting this now and listen if you read the back of the book he loses so if I can say anything to you all your testing trials you're going to come forth is go David that's good man have a bad day tomorrow be better I passed Connie in the hall the other day she said you sick I said yep but I'll be better in a little while I walked in I laid down to 1106. that's what I did I was so sick I couldn't stand myself what'd you do I didn't whine I didn't cry I'll get through this I laid down I got up and I went and got my wood splitter going and I split wood the rest of the evening don't let it destroy your whole day just cause he boogers you up for an hour brother Ron I feel kind of Moody yeah you're supposed to feel like that once in a while it's your flesh well brother as prophets ever felt Moody Elijah in a cave under a tree brother Brown said he got the blues these sisters that have babies they've been praying for a baby they've been wanting a baby now the baby is there and they get the Blues it don't mean life's over it means their body is going through Hormel changes they'll get over it they may not think it for a few days but they'll get over it men be patient and thank God [Applause] that a baby didn't come through here at this church we believe men are men and women are women [Applause] you've allowed our enemies to Prevail over us we pass through fire and flood yet in the end you always bring us out better than we were before did you with me and we're saturated with your goodness Romans chapter 4 and verse 17. as it was written I have made thee a father of many nations this is before he ever had a child God said I have made you a father of many nations before him who believed even God who quickeneth the dead calleth those things Rich be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the Badness of Sarah's womb notice these words he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith given glory to God I love this next verse and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform passion translation Against All Odds when it looked hopeless Abraham believed the promise and expected God to fulfill it listen Abraham couldn't do it so God had to do it you and I can't produce Resurrection so God I have to do it we can't produce Rapture so God will have to do it some of the trials you go through you can't get through without God holding your hand I love that song I can't even walk without you holding mine Abraham believed the promise of God and expected God to fulfill it he took God at his word and as a result he became the father of many nations God's declaration over him to come to pass that your descendants will be so many they will be impossible to count can you imagine him sitting on the well maybe at the Gate of the city and he's childless and he looks over at his buddies and he said my descendants are going to be so many it'll be impossible to count can you imagine the neighbors going home and telling their wife for supper because we talk about people I told the truth right there in church you talk about your teacher you talk about your friends you talk about your co-workers you talk it's what you do ain't that right hey they're right just go ahead and admit it let me have a hundred percent participation you know you do that's right good or bad we're hoping some of these new people come in they don't talk about people but we're going to talk about you but when you see him today you're going to realize we're a team here we got your back when nobody else had got your back we got your back [Applause] you know it's the truth you're you're in Louisiana but you know it's the truth y'all don't talk about coffee all the time you do not talk about coffee all the time so they go home and they go that crazy Abraham he you know he couldn't live with Abram now he's Abraham he thinks he's got God in his name and now he told me today I'm going to have so many kids and kids are going to have kids and kids are going to have kids I'm going to have so many descendants they're going to be impossible to count I switch some people at church the other day and you know they went to church and they came home and and do you believe that they think before Russia drops a bomb on us that they're going to leave and Los Angeles is going to drop beneath the ocean can you believe what they're talking about there and they're going to take their children that church is going to be empty except for a few and they're going to go in a Rapture in the moment in the twinkle of an eye some are going to be driving down the road some are going to be drinking coffee and they're going to evaporate [Music] yeah that's what I believe finish the quote in spite of being nearly 100 years old when he when the promise of having a son was made his faith was so strong that it could not undermine by the fact that he and Sarah was incapable of conceiving a child but he never stopped believing God he never stopped believing God God's promise for he was made strong in his faith to father a child and because he was mighty in faith and convinced that God had all the power needed to fulfill his own promises Abraham glorified trying to behave Revelations chapter 12 and verse 10. and I heard a loud voice and saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and not now this is our part and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death translation and then I heard a triumphant voice in heaven proclaiming now salvation and power are set in place and the kingdom reigneth of our God and the rule and authority of his anointed one are established for the accuser of our brothers and sisters are Relentless and accuse them before God day and not and now he has been defeated he has cast out once and for all I read that for the devil he might as well know his future and he might as well know who's whipping him Hallelujah found this to be an interesting quote we as human beings get impatient laughs some didn't hear it some did we as human beings get impatient how many has a Keurig coffee pot Curry you put the pot in the courage I'm sorry I'm going to tell you something you put the pod in the Couric you push the power button on and you flip it down and you pick which setting that you want eight ounces strong or hot and you stand there and you go you go feed the dog you go feed the cat you go because you can't wait 45 seconds it's got to heat up you're not over top of a of a hot fire with wood and you got a little screen there and you go down to the river and get you some water and you put some grounds of coffee I don't know how it worked you put some grounds of coffee and you cooked it for 30 minutes and you finally stood isn't that good you waited 45 seconds I know I'm talking to you I I can feel it we pray a prayer we pray I pray I'm recall to the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob we're specific who we're talking to and we tell him what we want him to do we thank him for his goodness we thank you for his Mercy we thank him and Lord Lord Heal my tooth that has hurt me so bad or my earache or my toe that's hurting and we expect when the words fall of our mouth brother Ron but you're preaching the sermon and you're standing there with cancer raging in your body I want you to understand Satan would have doesn't kill me if he could have but since he hasn't had the ability to do it I can stand here and preach to you be patient with God sometimes God cannot answer spontaneously he said how many knows that Daniel Prayed and 21 days before the angel could get to him but he finally gets around so just leave it alone so many testimonies we could tell hundreds and hundreds of things that happened in a day Daniel was in trouble listen he was in trouble and God heard him the first time he asked but Satan held him up there was a war in the heavenlies that blocked the visitation but listen listen God don't he don't just say okay I'm not going to be able to answer that prayer he went and got reinforcements listen for your trial the calvary is coming it is [Laughter] Hallelujah any good so there was a place picked to where that Satan and God would battle in your flesh and they chose your mind yes it's right there they chose that is to be in the battlefield were the enemies would fight one another see Russia and America has chose a place called Ukraine to fight whether you really know it or not they've chose a place to fight so that's where they're testing everything out your polit your your media is telling you a whole different thing but they've chose a place where to fight they don't want to fight it to Kremlin they don't want to fight at Washington so they've chose a place to fight so God listen you don't have to believe that if you don't want to but it's the truth so God and the devil chose a place called your mind this is the place where the battle rages no matter if you've been a Believer for 50 years this is the place that it rages the other morning I woke up very early in the morning and this is this is why this sermon is being preached I felt so confused in my mind unbelief is trying to settle in my room and in my thoughts and I was so confused I I I just what's right's right what's wrong's wrong and I I was just I was just confused in my mind and I knew that wasn't the spirit of God I'm a Believer I believe this message with all my heart I've had phenomenal Supernatural experiences and here I'm battling in my mind I knew it wasn't medicine I knew that there was now a fight that was going on Connie was laying there asleep I I'm a I'm a fighting and I'm wrestling and I just decided hey I'm not going to bed with this going on and I began to go in and I start reading the Bible I start listening to a tape and I begin to I begin to just and it took about an hour for that Spirit to just break but when it did gold came out of it you're gonna have to wrestle at times you're going to have to fight at times you're going to have to believe when it seems unbelievable you're going to have to believe for the impossible but did not God open up the Red Sea did not God close the mouths of lions and allowed Daniel to be in the presence of God and walk out of the den did not God come and visit with three Hebrew children in the fire our champion of champions came to his ultimate test Jesus in every meeting was made fun of every meeting the devil was always there to question to make fun to criticize to scoff he got hungry had a headache foreign though he healed them all still the enemy Tried Him in every way that he could try the enemy came to him when he was 40 days without food and he was wore out it just seemed like he as a man he was at the end of his strength and then the tempter came Jesus did not defeat him with his power he could have being who he was he could have defeated him but he took the word you can't defeat him with your personal strength but you take the word because the word came from God and the word whipped the devil every generation it'll do it in yours too brother Ron but I I sometimes just have so many feelings don't be confused by your feelings your feelings has nothing to do with overcoming somebody didn't shake your hand okay maybe they didn't see you somebody's in a you oh that person's in a bad mood Hey listen pray for him pray for them they need your prayers more at that point we're a team here we're a family here we don't Circle one off and cast them off we need every one of you nobody loves me you've just got the wrong feeling everybody in this building loves you well they forgot all about me listen you may be the one that everybody's praying for and Jesus Took the word and said it is written it is written it is written but his ultimate test was when they handed him across did he just stain it no when he come to the ultimate test he embraced it we don't have a picture of it today but there he stood with thorns all over his head his body was had strikes all over it blood was pouring down I can't say it vividly enough organs were showing through his back but when they placed that piece of wood on him rugged piece of wood it's a hard thing to see but he kissed it he embraced it this trial would get you when he healed the leopard it was one when the woman touched his garment it was one but this piece of wood would pay all the way from Adam till the last seed comes in I'll finish this two weeks from now but if you could only realize the trial that you're going through is bringing gold out of you your body probably some of us are forth more than others viral buy our build some are fluffier they know this but the average person is worth 84 cents think about that 84 cents if you go to Hardee's today or McDonald's today you're going to pay more than that for a kitty Burger and you're going to take that kitty burger and you're going to put it in here in that 84 cents because you're hungry but God's going to put you through fire and through trials because the great essay test says you're worth more than gold us guys are in the essay business we take things off your car we send it through smelters and we get the goody out of it sometimes there's not much goody but we get the goodie out of it what people call junk we call Treasures now you know what we do and when God looks down through time and he sees you you just sung about it and you know all the tests that you're even going through now but they're going to bring gold out of you let's stand to our feet this morning can I give you one more scripture none of us has had a day like job had we don't want to even start our book like that sister Doris you don't want to have a job day now Charlie may give you a fit but you do not want a job day messenger after messenger came and told him he'd lost this and he had lost that and he lost this and he lost that listen God didn't send him a letter before it all started and said if you can make it through this trial I'll give you a double he didn't get that but somewhere God had a testimony service with the Devil and the devil came up and he said you know if you take your hands off a job I'll cause him to lie tells him to turn around and hate you and so God gave him parameters to where he could work with friends turned on him even his wife turned on him sometimes you think you're all alone just think about Joe finally at the end of the day a lot of Trials went on God himself came to job and he began to talk to him he didn't talk to him about his problems he didn't talk about all of his losses as a matter of fact God didn't have a pity party with him God didn't talk about what was on Earth God talked about what was in heaven when we get to heaven we won't talk about our problems down here that's just going to be silly stuff and a quote of another great lady that's just going to be silly stuff he could just Elevate you to the word the city that you're going to you're going to walk on gold and the gates of pearl and there's going to be rivers of flow and water all the way down through the properties of of that great City while the city's 1500 miles wide and 1500 miles high and it's going to be so constructed to you feel like you're walking on level ground I'm gonna be the light of the city but I got a flat tire it don't matter job where was you at where was you at when I laid the foundations of the Earth trial of your faith part one Give the
