touched the hem of His garment if she would have just not really yet to press herself through the crowd pressure self past unbelief pressure self past the flesh press yourself past where you wish you

heart I want to see [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh Oh [Music] Oh [Music] I want to say look in overnight [Music] [Applause] [Music] and so we've came to see tonight a man it is so good to be in the house of the Lord this evening I can't tell you how happy I am to see each and every one of you I oh my heart is just overwhelming just to be able to see one another but my heart also breaks at the on the side of this because half of our congregation can't be here on this night and then the rest of our congregations hearts will be breaking tomorrow because you won't be with us and but we're just thankful that we're able to have service and able to be in the house of the Lord [Applause] [Music] raise his holy name praise his holy name hey man we're so so sorry that we have to go through all of this rigmarole to have Church and as again as I stated that if I thought that this was a Christian persecution or they were trying to shut down the churches we'd have been here but this was for your safety and for the rest of our safety and and so we just we follow the leadership of the Lord and and we have to give Caesar what is Caesar's and we thank you for bearing with us and all of this all of this is new to us as well and we're doing the very best of what we can as we can and I so appreciate you coming to the house of the Lord this evening and I I as I said last weekend I have been a privilege to be able to have service with a few chosen but I'm sure sure thankful to be here with the elected tonight and and just very thankful that you're able to be here and so we just we just want to move forward and just to have ourselves a good old-fashioned devil stomping the kind of service and a man I trust you've all come ready for the word and certainly a little bit nervous I you forgive me if I forget how to do this in front of a crowd and you know I've preached to less than we've had here in the past couple of weeks and I think it's nine nine weeks that we've had I preached two less but in a tighter quarters and so with I wouldn't say the word awkward but I would say that it was definitely different without having you here and so we're thankful for the Lord to be able to have these services and so we just want to make a reminder to you that tomorrow morning service will be at 11:00 for the the other side of the church and hopefully we don't have to do this too much longer but we can move right back into order and if we see that we can handle the crowd the way it is you know doing different social distances and things we'll make different arrangements as it as it comes to us and so we so thank you for being here this evening Amen we love you fall of our heart maybe we could sing that song because of who you are as we get ready to go to the word semen thank you brother William for setting the atmosphere this evening and the presence of the Lord so near the bringing greetings from our pastor brother Ron and he's home resting brother brother Gabriel was there with him this evening and and he certainly cannot wait to be back 100% you know we're thankful for is that but I know if you're feeling bad no matter if it's a head cold or whatever you want to be back to 100% and Ron's got a little bit more than a head cold going on but we're so thankful that the Lord is molestin to be able to have the strength that he's got during this amen let's sing this song for bear hearts [Music] because I gave you [Applause] and because [Music] [Applause] because ours because [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heavenly Father we come before your great throne of mercy this evening or what a privilege it is for us to be assembled together the way that you ordained us to be here father we realize that on the other side of that cameras is a great portion of our church father or that would love to be here setting with us in heavenly places but I believe that though we are set it right now in heavenly places the believers position in Christ and we realize father that where two or three are gathered in my name there up will be Lord I know that you're here your word tells me that you're here the anointing tells me that you're here Lord your children have gathered father I look out I don't see a bunch of chickens that's scared of the curl of our Sun look at the Eagles that are willing to fly higher than a sickness higher than then denominationalism higher than the guy the governor's orders higher than that father we look out upon a children of people that that have been called by your name and set aside a people that you have slipped on the wedding band of a merited grace that if don't be here for you father they've not come to hear from me before they realize that that out of a man when you deal for redemption and you deal for humanity father but I pray that you would take these 16 elements fall that you created for your service and I pray for today's service that you would bring for your purpose of God do you know exactly what will be done and what would be sad father but I pray that you reached out your all mercy in your hand of deliverance and your your power father and reach out and touch your children where they're at what they're going through in their own life and may they may they be ministered to by the son of man of God Lord we commit this service to you everything that'll be done and said to your holy name may you be pleased O God with our worship with the words of our mouth and the meditation of our heart we love you hard the name of Jesus Christ we pray these things you have your Bibles this evening we'll turn over to the book of John chapter 1 and then also to Isaiah chapter 14 John chapter 1 verse 1 and I closed last weekend service on I'm committed to the purpose and I honestly thought that the Lord was was done with this thought but he he began as soon as I left for the pulpit I the Lord began to deal with me on these things so we just want to speak tonight by the help of the Lord on I'm committed to the purpose and before I forget I would like to wish brother Elijah Bor Levon a happy birthday today god bless you buddy happy birthday from us a man committed to the purpose John chapter one and verse 1 the Bible says and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made now to me I could get hung up on that one scripture for all day and stay there to realize that all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made so we realized tonight that we're standing on the very spot convert of God the very word made materialization in front of our eyes and we we see that without him so we see here that he's the key ingredient to life that without him was not anything made that was made it's just like you sisters that are making a cake if you forget your flower when you're making that cake there's something in there well that will not allow it to rise you have forgotten a key ingredient and if you have forgotten Christ in your life you have forgotten the key ingredient that will make you rise above sickness rise above despair rise above life rise above all things if Christ is not the center focus of your life you have forgotten the key ingredient for without him without him was not anything made that was made anything that was formed constructed or that was constructed by combining substances now as you're turning over to Isaiah chapter 14 I like to read this this quote from proving his word he said the Prophet said when he predestinated in Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he come over and he predestinate seni thing to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be sold when he predestinate s-- anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time he predestinated a bride and she's going to be there can you say a man going to be a rapture she's going to be there he predestinate sit by his foreknowledge and see there's nothing going to stop it won't you say that there's nothing going to stop it isaiah chapter 14 and verse 24 from which we'd like to draw our context tonight the Lord of Hosts has sworn saying surely as I have thought so shall it come to pass and as I have purposed so shall it stand that I will break the Assyrian in my land and upon my Mountain shred him underfoot then shall his yoke depart from off them and his burden depart from off their shoulders this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations for the Lord of hosts hath purposed who shall dis anole it and his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back may God bless the reading of the word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord committed to the purpose and we we see here we see here as we look in Isaiah 14 and 20 for the Lord of Hosts has sworn saying surely as I have thought so shall it come to pass and as I have purposed so shall it stand now we look here and we realized that that God has sworn and we see the oath that that here the oath that was here designed it was to comfort the Jews or the Israelites when they would be in a time that they were in captivity in in the in the city of Babylon and here God gives him an oath and a confirmation with assurance that what he had thus promised would assuredly come to pass you see it's a one thing to realize that when the promises of God are laid out there before you and a lot of times when you don't need that promise you'll just kind of walk over that promise or or you're maybe not necessarily neglected or disrespected in a manner but you don't necessarily need that that promise in that sense because you're not in that portion of life in that portion when when you don't really need a piece of healing in your body you're not necessarily looking for the scriptures of healing maybe you're looking for maybe you're looking for peace or maybe you're looking for joy but you see there this promise was laying there for for so how many years it was laying there it was put there but he came to a spot when the children of Israel the Jews they needed that scripture and it brought them great assurance to know that that the thing that they were going through down in captivity down in Babylon that the thing that they were going through was spoken by by the fit which they knew which was a divan sphere so that divine seer was able to look into his Eagle Eye and capture that this word would be brought forth and and it would be manifested in a certain season you see they were under that burden and under that spot but they did not despair and they did not depart from the word of truth because you see that word was laying there that promise was laying there and when you're in the midst of a battle and you're going through a season when you need a you and you need hope when you need joy when you need peace when they're going through that battle that scripture or that promise it's made more alive than when you did not need it when you are in a time of peace the Lord the scriptures on warfare didn't mean as much to you but when you are in the midst of a battle when you're in the midst of the battle it gives you assurance that I'm coming out you see when he told them that I will break the band of the Assyrians even though they were there in captivity they realized that they were coming out that he would tread them upon the mountain that he would break down their captivity that the promise was laying there you see we recognize that the Word of God is is infallible that the Word of God that when God says anything then he makes her promise that God can't take that promise back because he's God you see any sovereign and he can't go back on that promise you see God cannot lie and be God so we recognized that the Word of God that we have in front of us is the unfailing Word of God it is infallible it's not like you and I that we change with winds that come by but the Word of God remains true no matter what we're going through the Word of God is to us being living Oracle's of a Living God that we realize that the Word of God is to us a divine communication and we realize that the Word of God is a force now any man can say words anybody can just rattle off at the mouth and just three things but you see that when that man speaks something he's the man that has to back up what he has said but we realized that the Word of God is a force that when God speaks something there's something that is backing up it's backing up what has been spoken it's backing up what has been said and there is a being that is behind that word of truth we have a shorter word of prophecy and if you could realize tonight that when you look over in the Book of Isaiah that by His stripes we are healed that there is a force that is behind that word it's not just some man is not just some prophet but there is a force that is behind that word that will bring it to pass in a brilliance of past not in tomorrow or not just in some day in the future but it'll bring it to pass because then it is a Living Word there is a force that is behind this word you see when God spoke the world into existence he spoke those sayings that he wanted to see manifested but he did not just let him loose and lay them there hanging there but there was a body that was behind it there was a force that was behind it if you could realize tonight that there is a God of heaven that is behind his word that is backing up what he said that this ain't the governor's words the governor may see that we're going to be in this for June 10th or however long they want to say but God knows the end and he knows the beginning they may tell us that we have to worship like this but God is the God that needs to be worshipped he's not permitted us to be that we were just stay in our homes and listen to a tape he has committed us to live in an hour with a living voice hello young God is committed to that purpose you see his purpose is his worth to you it is his word of truth that will bring the promises of pass I'm not having I'm not having to stand here today because I have to be honest I would be shaking my books if I had to try to manifest one of the gifts I would I'd be shaking in my boots if I would have to try to manifest the promises of God but you realize I understand the responsibility that's on my shoulder but do you realize how easy it is for me to walk out that door and come stand behind this pulpit and realize that I don't have to back up what God says but God will back up what he's him if he said I'm the LORD thy God that heals all of my diseases that's who he is that's who he is see this is a very literal life of God in written form and we realize that it is this word that conquers all things this word conquers powers it conquers principalities and conquer sickness it conquers death it conquers torment it conquers Devils it conquers everything there is you can name off what you want to write there but the Lord of God will conquer it he will defeat Satan anytime anyplace under any situation and there is such power in the Word of God because you realize that God is going to prove what he said he's going to prove what he said now he will not prove it to unbelievers he will not prove it to skeptics he will not prove it to even to critics but he will prove his word to believers that believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever the Prophet said it to him that believed and if he can find somebody who will believe his word he will prove his word to you I say Oh God Here I am Here I am you see if you believe God will prove his word to you now we look here in the passage of Scripture that we ready are now saying that y'all way have sworn jehovah has sworn you see when we look at that scripture when you see when God has sworn that he is often is often represented as making a use of an oath to denote such a strong confirmation and that there is absolute certainty in what he utters from his lips you see when God when God speaks any things that should be enough because he's gone but then God comes behind it with a sworn affidavit that he cannot lie just like we read to you last weekend in Genesis 24 and 7 that the Lord God of heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred which spake to me and that swear unto me saying under thy seed will I give this land you see he swore to Abraham that I'm going to give you this land and he sends out his elders servant Eliezer notice what he said he not Abraham but he shall send His angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife under my son from this you see it was not Abraham swearing it he was not any easier that was swearing it but it was God to me you put god behind anything and it settles it to me if you put God before anything it settles it are you with me and here ear Abraham is telling his servant that he has sworn unto me and I would tell you that he is going to send his angel before thee you see Eliezer could go with an assurance knowing that he was going to bring for the bride because there was an angel that was gone before him you see just like when we read over when Paul would would relay it to us in Hebrews chapter 6 and 13 that when God he could not swear by no greater but he swore by himself that in blessing I will bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply I love the main part there I ll him Almighty God I will bless thee I love it when I get to talk there with God and he talks back to me and he says I'm the one I'm the one I the iron you see anything is possible when I am this present anything is possible when the I am shows up do you realize the night that you are sitting in heavenly places and that all things are possible because the I am said that where you are I will be there that I will not leave you I will not forsake you through this whole coronavirus he has been there all the time you've been studying in your home all by yourself but God's been there he's not just committed to you when you come to the house of God he's committed to you 365 days of the year whoa hallelujah he will never stop fighting for me see this passage that we read in Isaiah is a full proof that God cannot change that whatever he purposes whatever the purposes of God are that they are inflexible they ain't changing you see because change supposes and imperfection you see men like you and I we change our minds let me change my mind today well praise the Lord some of you ain't change your mind praise God but you know as humanistic swill preached to the humans here tonight but we hear we realize that the humans we change our minds there's things that come up when we just we we adapt to things as they come there are there are events that happen in our life that we didn't see coming so we just changed we are in an ever-changing battlefront as Christians and there are some times that we have to change the avenue I as a minister of the gospel Jesus Christ and as a sociopath stir here if I see something that slipping in I will change my approach on a certain subject I will change what God has said but I'll change as brother Branham would say the turning of the Dom and so that you can in a certain way now I can change there are things that have already changed in my own sermon notes that you don't know nothing about but you change the way that I presented something but it did not change what God thought hallelujah we can get it in our mind how things are going to come forth and how things are going to be presented but God will not change look at your neighbors say God ain't change it you see we as human beings there's things that we do and we have to redeem ourselves we have to realize hey where'd the man up say look I was a human being right there I didn't mean to do it like that and you have to go back and prove that you're a person that can be counted on maybe you missed your appointment and you go back and say look that was something that came up you what you're doing is redeeming yourself but you see God has never had to redeem himself but he had to redeem you and I you see when he created man he created him a free moral agency and we realized that in Christ was attributes of a Redeemer of buying back and here you see he had these attributes in him to be father and in him to be son and in him to be healer in him to be Redeemer but here as man has put on free moral agency he was not going to settle for a falling condition of man that was made in his own image that he took from the dust of the earth he placed him there because God wanted to display himself woo you see you see as like as we look you can look at the art piece Michelangelo's art piece that he created on Moses and it is deemed to be a masterpiece and we can look at that and we can we can all add pattern and there are many critics to those that look on Michelangelo as he is depicting and maybe you would depict Moses in a different way but you're not known like Michelangelo is known but you see as Michelangelo who as he's working on this he didn't just grab a piece of marble and just start on it but here here he is years before he ever even puts it down on a piece of paper he has this vision and I want to capture this one thought the brother branham said that Michelangelo was carrying this vision of Moses for years he was carrying this vision and he's looking at this vision in his mind just like you and I we have memories and we pull out those memories and we look at those memories we turn them around every whichaway and we try to remember everything about that event but here Michelangelo being gifted he's looking at this vision he's looking at it and he's carrying this thing and many many years later after he's carrying this thing then he begins to work he spends a better part of his life town contemplating and looking over this piece of art because you see it can't be just one piece of art he is depicting and describing one of the greatest prophets in the Old Testament so he goes to the Old Testament and he looks at the Old Testament and he sees how Moses is portrayed how that he is an older man and how that he comes off of the mountain and some people look at those horns almost as his head and for my what was he trying to create but what is he trying to depict is when Moses came down off the mountain that the Bible said that his face shone with a glory and Michelangelo is capturing that and he's putting it on marble he didn't just come up with a song but he's carrying it in his mind and he goes through his mind and one day he starts getting out of chisel and he commits his whole life's work to bringing forth this masterpiece called Moses that he would bring people would look at when they would go through the guard and some people would have them as statues in their home he didn't realize exactly what he was creating they would create replicas and different things but Michelangelo had it in his mind and he had to get it off of his mind now anybody I don't understand artistry I'm not an artist because the only thing I can draw a stick figure I highly doubt the people who come and look at my stick figures but I highly I do not even think that Michelangelo who had the idea of how many thousands and millions of people would look would look at the statue and criticizing and look at it with a different Avenue but you see what he was doing when he had me he had this vision and he created it he created it and it came to such a spot that when he got it and it perfected it it finally he rubbed it the last time he took the dust off of it for the last time he put his chisel in his hammer down for the last time and he smooth it on the knee and said speak now you and I can understand that but the vision that he had seen for all of those years have became manifested and it looked so real to him that he would smite it and say speak Oh hallelujah you see in Christ the mystery of God revealed the Prophet said that he loved fatherhood hallelujah and he created Adam a free moral agency but he was not going to stand by and allow his creation to live in that fallen condition you see he had it in his vine brother Josh he had it in his mind that there would be a people that would be victorious and so he would look and he would sculpt and he would mold he went from Adam when he failed and then it went to Noah but Noah died a drunk it went from Moses and Moses had a temper but he came down promoting this and that one and this one and that one and so many times we get caught up with who we are and this is going on and that's going on I'd say as parents sometimes you wonder are they really getting it but if you can look back at your genealogy and say hey they played a part in the lineage of Jesus Christ I'd say that Isaac and Rebecca got a little upset some days with Jacob a little Johnny you know what I'm talking about there's some days in your life when you get so tore up because they're not bringing forth what you had in mind but look at Jacob Jacob was a shyster Jacob was a deceiver but one time in the presence of the angel of the Lord and it changed Jacob from a deceiver fed to a walking Prince but Jacob deceived you look at all the prophets but finally it came down to one that when one was walking on the shores of the Jordan and then John the Baptist looks up and says behold the lamb of God which takes away the sin of the world and the spirit of a dove us ended on that lamb descended on that lamb you see what was he he was the perfect masterpiece that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world John being a prophet could look in there and grab that vision which God which God had in his mind and said this is him this is the one that was spoke up and God was so enthused about the masterpiece that he had created that he smote him and he smote him and he struck him why to bring forward more masterpieces that the perfect masterpiece could bring forth you and I through the shedding of his blood you see it was in his mind it was in his mind but here it was made manifest you see here Jehovah was manifested in the flesh when he was on earth he said he was God he looked like God he talked like God he he preached my God hallelujah He healed my god he rose like God he ascended like God and he was God he was God in the flesh and God was in his son manifesting himself to his people you see all that God was he poured himself he emptied himself out into Christ and all that was Christ was he poured he poured himself into the church you see these things that we've been speaking to you on that he has not asked you to do but you did not have the capacity to do he has known exactly who you are you see when Christ came he knew that he had the capacity to take the blood of Calvary and when you came on the scene he knew exactly who you are and why he built you to be you see he is the word and he's proof of the worth he proved exactly who he was that he was the one that was made manifest the one that was spoken when he's standing there and he has 5000 followers that are following him and they're hungry he shows that he's Jehovah when he sets him down and all of a sudden he begins to multiply the fish in a bread he proves that he was Jehovah when he walks into a room of criticism when there's death laying there he proved that he was Jehovah to Jairus and his family he had to kick out all the unbelief but he allowed belief to stay he proved that he was the same yesterday too day and forever when he's standing there and he says Talitha koum me which being interpreted means daughter arise I have heard that same voice speaking this hour Talitha call me Brad arise arise out of your condition arise out of your sickness arise out of death arise out of criticism hallelujah he's ordained you before the foundation of Laurel and there ain't nothing going to stop it notice what the Prophet said in this day the scriptures were filled he said sometimes you may be sitting out there with a cancer you might be sitting out there with the disease you think while me being a Christian would be in this way why would I be sitting like this if I'm a Christian sometimes God lets the things get so dark that you can't see HUP around or anywhere else then he comes and makes a way through it for you that you might say this day this scripture is fulfilled that he promised to do you said in that condition he think well am I really a Christian but God allows you to go through things to show forth his glory there's one thing about God he ain't gonna let nobody get the glory he ain't gonna let a doctor get his glory hello he's not gonna let her lawyer did his glory he's not gonna let a preacher get his glory I'm not the one that healed you when I laid my hands on you o mighty God he's the one that said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it's not my hands it's not brother branham it's not the minister it's mighty God hallelujah but oftentimes we get caught up on the now we get caught up on the now and we messes up it messes up our vision our human vision for the future but it does not mess up God's vision we get caught up and think this has got to be this where that's gonna be that way we're looking at the now instead of the future but if you can look at the present and see that he is there I am of right now and the I am of the future don't get caught up on your now get caught up with your future you see just like a Lazarus when he was when he was there and Martha and Mary came running to Jesus when Jesus was in a certain city they came running into the city and they told him that her friend that their brother Jesus his friend Lazarus was was sick and they wanted him to come and restore him but Jesus turns and says that the sickness is not unto death now it takes a whole lot of faith to look past the now are you with me faith looks past the circumstance faith looks past the now because you had to realize for the disciples still to be walking with him here in a few moments in time when Lazarus dies that they realized who they were walking with they were not walking with just another fisherman but they were walking with Jesus and if you could realize tonight who you're walking with don't get caught up with what's going on in the USA you have been promised a body change no matter what Fox News CNN ABC NBC no matter what they say you have been promised something God is committed to bring it to pass but you see it took a lot of faith because you can't fix you can't mix faith and unbelief together and you can't mix reasoning and the word together well Martha come to this spot she had to believe against all odds she had to believe against death she had to believe against what she's seen in the natural eternal of me to Deuteronomy 16 and to the Bible says here that thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover under the LORD thy God of the flock and the herd and in the place which the Lord shall choose to the Lord set used to place his name there that thou shall eat no leavened bread with it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith even the bread of affliction for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste that thou mayest remember the day when thou came as forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life you see notice where they are to sacrifice that it is in the place not where the priests but where the Lord chose to put his name there and any any father realizes that his son is carrying his name you realize today that God did not choose to put his name in any other place but in his son is where he chose to put his name jesus said I came in my father's name and you believe me not we're getting ready to go into Memorial Day this coming weekend this coming monday is Memorial Day it's a day of remembrance a day of remembering that we are a nation that is free to worship it's a time to remember those that were willing to fight for us it's a time to remember on what this nation was built on not on what Nancy Pelosi wants it to be but what we were built on it's a time of remembrance and here Moses is instructing them to remember the day that you came out to remember this day because you came out in haste and you couldn't breath you couldn't bring out the sacrifice in that day I remember this day remember the day that you came out the enemy the look that they had on their face when you came out not in half victory but full victory remember when you came out and you were no longer gonna be beat no more remember when you come out and you knew that you are going to come out shouting on the other side remember when he told you that he would make you the head and not the tail hallelujah it was a time to remember that this day is the last day that in Egypt we'll be able to beat you anymore it was a day to remember that you were the victor and Egypt was defeated it was a time to remember that Jehovah was the mighty God that showed up in their life if they could remember that they came out of Egypt what about you and I it's a time to remember that he called us how to Laodicea he called us how to denominationalism he called us he quickened us he changed us he made us hallelujah don't you ever forget that he's the one that brought you out Moses was setting a precedent that this is the day of memory how about this that you point on this day you put on this day you remember this day that it was for nine weeks that the devil kept you out of church it was for nine weeks a you couldn't worship the way you were built to be worshipped how about you remember this that all the blessings that the devil tried to steal from you why don't you remember this day making a Memorial Day I will once up in the place that the Lord chose to put his name this day is a day of memory this study this scripture is fulfilled Satan look like he had you bound up in your home I remember this day we came out stronger than when we went here remember this day we're closer to a body change remember this day that God is still committed through sickness food playing through cancer phutarmal remember this is the day which the Lord has made this is where we choose to sacrifice I'll say no like that kind of preaching that's what he's trying to keep from me for six weeks nine weeks you see there's no other resurrection there's no resurrection outside of the name of Jesus is that right there's no healing that's have the name Jesus there's no power in any other religion outside of this Christian religion you see because they have their worshippers they have the God that they worship but they're God's laying in it to your God ain't remember this day now look we look here and you see that they had to eat of the unleavened bread for seven days that there was no mixing that there was no entangle that they could not mix any leaven in with the bread that it had to be like a tasteless bread that it had to be in such a form that you would not mix it and you would not change it you see he was for a day amendments there being no mixing just like the tree that Eve ate from he is a mixed tree is there I it was a tree of good and evil and you can look at the societies of the day and you can see the Red Cross you can see their works but it's a mixed gospel that they're preaching you see the tree that they're eating off of now look here look here in Martha she had to forfeit all that she had rights through to recognize the Word of God was made manifest right before her he said I am the resurrection and the life that he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us now this see there was one more little clause that she hadn't come in Lambeth but she said yeh Lord I believe it that even now I believe that Howard the Christ the Son of the Living God oh brother everything was ready to spark off right then where have you laid him and you know what took place see you have got to get in that right place before he will receive your sacrifice see you got to come into it what's in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name here thou shalt not eat no leavened bread in it what does that typify and the sacrifice don't mix with it it agreed it's got to be the word no leavened bread leaven is you know what eleven is in it anything a little leaven leavens the whole lump the whole lump is the body you can't put one speck of denomination or creating the Christ no sir it won't work seven days that's how eat unleavened bread there in seven days what does that typify the complete seven Church ages seven days what why did they why'd they have to eat it seven days before what before going out and the hard church age from the beginning to the end has to live only on the Word of God that so you're Roman Creed's Methodist Baptist and Pentecostal Creed's are all dead seven days eat unleavened bread no leaven shall be found amongst the bride no word at it no nothing you see they were to eat that bread for seven days which was a type of the church ages and what is a bread a type of that Jesus said that no man can live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God jesus said I am the bread that came down from heaven we're not feeding on the mind of a man were feeding on the unfailing body Word of the Son of Man it was this pure word that took them out and it will be this pure word that will put the bride in a body change it's not a mixed word that's not living in it it's not a mixed word it's got hip-hop in it it's not a worship that's got all kinds of charismatic in it it's a pure word it's a pure worship because it's a pure bride that God is bringing forth hallelujah what are you doing brother hands were in this day I'm watching for God's promises to come to pass because I realize that everything that he has had in his word has got to come to fulfillment it's got to come to materialization I realize that there are those that will have to go by the way of the grave to fulfill that portion of Scripture that the dead in Christ shall rise first but there is a people that is going to fulfill the other part of that scripture that they that are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye hello somebody he's gonna watch that promise come to pass we were put here to watch him were put here to watch him as he works watch him bring forth his promise and make it come to pass but Laodicea makes us lazy and just because we're the bride of Jesus Christ now we're not a part of Laodicea but yet there are still those that get contaminated with the layout of saying flu that makes him lukewarm and cold and formal and they want to adapt in a way everybody else wants adapt but we are to be watching and living gospel we're to be watching this word as it's coming to pass this seemed what we have given to us is a living word it's not dead it's active there's a quickening power that is behind the safe the Lord there should be nothing shake us you know where you were at before this happened and before after this happened but there should have been no coronavirus if you were really settled and surrendered to God there should have been nothing that shook you off the promises of God sure it may have change how you worship may have changed what you had to do but it should not shake you from who you are because you have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken so many times you got people that let down their wall of defense and they forget that they are in a spiritual warfare and that the enemy is after them after their church after their children after the families after their job he wants to steal kill and destroy we're to be watching the promises of God notice what Isaiah 62 and 6s let me wind this down for you to see notice Isaiah 62 and six I have set Watchmen upon thy walls o Jerusalem which shall never hold which shall never hold their peace day or night you that made bitching of the Lord keep not silence I'm gonna read it to you one more time I have set watchmen upon thy walls he is not saying that I am setting angels upon thy walls but I'm setting Watchmen there I am setting and what is in the precedent here is that he is setting ministers he is setting ministers upon our walls o Jerusalem which shall never hold their peace day nor night he that made mention of the Lord keep not silence you see those watchman were never to hold their peace do you think that I shut up when the enemy told us that we had to shut our doors no we held not our peace and we did not keep silence but we spoke hello whoo yeah now when you're looking to the scriptures and you see those Watchmen and how it was performed that it was performed by a loud cry that in the time of the days of the Bible that were reading here that they would go out in multiple hours of the day and they would speak these things with a loud voice and they would stand out there and holler to the caravans and to the rounds that were going by it would holler out God is one and then another would holler out he is merciful and then another would holler out take heed to yourselves hallelujah and you're here the ministers of this gospel holler out taking God is merciful God is good that is good all the time and all the time God is good God is one God is a healer God is a savior God is a deliverer and you look in I in Psalms chapter 134 and you get a beautiful picture of the temple watch behold come that'll bless you the Lord all you servants of the Lord which my night stand in the house of the Lord lift up your hands in the sanctuary and bless the Lord the Lord that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion now this is what the temple watch would do will you say well I'm not a minister of the gospel Jesus Christ but do you realize that the Bible said that he hath made us kings and priests so you can come into the sanctuary and you can lift up your hands and bless the Lord that made heaven and earth Psalms 135 praising the Lord praise you the name of the Lord praise him oshi servants of the Lord ye that stand in the house of the Lord in the courts of the house of our God praise the Lord for the Lord is good sing praises unto his name for it is pleasant for the lord hath chosen Jacob under himself and Israel for his peculiar treasure for I know that the Lord is great and that our Lord is above all gods I'd say that that is a temple watch that is going on through coronavirus that our God is above all gods hello that you can enter into I know some of you I don't had word come to me through text message and calling and different things and you couldn't wait for them doors open back there why because you wanted to do what God puts you here to do and that's the worship Nile we God but a mighty God [Applause] hallelujah you see the word is high protection the word is our law it's our protection from the enemy and the enemy wants you to let down your guard so that he can breach the walls but we are told to be sober and to be vigilant because your adversary the devil goes about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour who we are to resist steadfast in the faith the enemy wants to break down your belief system the enemy wants to breach the walls but the Bible said in Psalms 89 and 34 that my covenant will I not break nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips once I have sworn by my holiness that I will not lie on to David and his seed shall endure forever and his throne as the son before me it shall be established forever as the moon and as a faithful witness in heaven shall I you realize that the enemy wants to break down the word but God will never break and God would never alter his word you see the enemy wants to get you as far away from this word as he can you see when Jesus was there on Mount temptation he tempted Jesus for him to be made like a man he had Ashley go through temptation just like you and I was tempted like we're tempted he had to be tempted so Jesus had to get into a spot and Jesus having the power to be able to reverse it but he only gives Satan what'd you give him and that's the word you see what he was trying to do is he was trying to get Jesus to break that word you see he got Eve to break that word he got Moses to break that word he got David and Solomon to break that word but when he met the man Jesus he met more than a man that day and he could not break that word because the Lord was him do you realize who's standing amongst you tonight that is the same yesterday today and forever Jesus that will not change will not alter you see he will try to get you away from this world I try to break you try to break you from believing this word but he could not take you he cannot break you because you and the world have been united by taking on our headship Jesus Christ who what you have received in this hour is not another message but it is the message to return back to our wall of Defense our wall of fire this message that we have received is not a king's message but the Kings message lelou yeah we got something to believe here we got something to be proud about we got something to be excited about we got something that we can count on he's tried to stop this King sword in every way possible from preaching he's tried to stop it from cutting he's trying to stop it from discerning but Satan was defeated 2,000 years ago and he's defeated in this day why because God is committed to the purpose he's committed to his work he's committed to you you see because you were a part of a vision hallelujah you are part of his plan oh yeah and sickness may try to rob you from him car wrecks may try to rob you from him yeah but you're part of the vision hello when he struck the side when he struck that side it was not another creation but it was a part of the same creation you are not another bride you are the bride there's been churches churches Brides Brides but they must come on you're not of her you are the bride hallelujah we should not keep our salads nor should we hold our peace we should let our brains loose we should let our faith loose [Applause] we're not another creation we're a part of him and if Jesus could not be stopped you can't be stopped [Applause] you are the masterpiece you are a piece of the master we should not keep our so much he's trying to muzzle us down he's trying to keep us from speaking but if Abraham had to let it loose from his mouth and declare that me and Isaac will return again if Abraham had declared from his lips what about you hallelujah if the three Hebrew children had to declare it and speak it forth from their mouth they didn't hold their peace that he keeps silent but they declared from their mouth that yea we may die but our God is more than able to deliver us from this coronavirus from this fire from this sickness from this death they had to speak hallelujah if they had to speak what about you Dave had had to speak one Tok when he was tired of the sound of the silence of the children of his flock he realized that he was a time to break the silence it was a time to let it loose it was a time to speak and he said this day I will take your head off of your shoulders he was not willing to stand by and listen to the salads but he was willing to speak it is a time for the masterpiece of God to speak this word don't hold your peace don't hold your silence that's why I've been telling you to be vigilant in your prayers to be active in your prayers don't you give up well I prayed yesterday don't you do that you pray again well I got filled with the Holy Ghost ten years ago don't do that seek Him now find him now search for him now speak right now don't you hold your peace people say that your God is dead won't you speak up my brother William and sister Gabriel saying can I get a witness can I get a witness hello is he the Lord that God that heals all of your diseases can I get a witness is he worthy of your praise cannot get away this downloads of peace is he more than enough is he greater than cancer in Z greater than sugar diabetes hello is he greater is he greater than sin Oh bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all my benefits it's a time when the Watchmen should not hold their peace let the musicians come give him praise in the house of God we've been stimulated to watch we've been stimulated to speak we've been stimulated to move we're watching the promises come to pass we're progestin ated to stand we've been chosen by Almighty God he's committed to you you believe that tonight I don't shake your neighbours hand because I don't know what told you I'll do it but look at your neighbour I said he's committed to me he's committed to me he's committed to me he told you before the foundational order he's committed to me he predestinated that I would overcome he's committed to me he predestined me native native me to be victorious he made me he made me he chose me he's committed to me God ain't changing his mind about me and God had changing his mind about you we may fall but get back up here in his mind about you the only failure is for you when you don't get back up there's a God that's committed to you when you look like you were never coming he was still committed to you I'm so glad he didn't give up on me when everybody else gave up on me when preachers of this message gave up on me he was still committed to me [Applause] he's committed to now God ain't like the Washington Redskins or the Dallas Cowboys that'll draft you one day and trade you when you ain't good enough on the next day they'll trade you around and put you on a different team they don't want you on their team but God when he chose you you're the best that he's got oh I tell that to the devil I'm the best that God's got and Laodicea I'm a part of the elect I'm part of the chosen I'm part of the victory I'm part of the overcoming people he's gonna manage for me I'm the best that he's got there's some people that want to be on this team but they're not committed enough to be on this team but I look up hell on the people I look up all the people they say come here we'll come high water I'm committed come sickness come death control oh come whatever me I'm committed he stood for me I stand for him I'm committed lord I lift your name on high [Music] lord I lift your name on high hey God good ain't God good ain't God worthy
