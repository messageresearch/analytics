[47:37] amen amen you love the Lord tonight
[47:41] amen I just want to say it's uh been a
[47:45] great weekend already and we ain't even
[47:47] had Church hardly yet
[47:50] and uh I told Andrew one of those you
[47:52] just sing all night but you know I'll be
[47:54] happy back there just worshiping the
[47:56] Lord and and certainly thankful for all
[48:00] the hospitality for brother Ron and
[48:02] sister Connie and sister Katie and
[48:04] brother Andrew and and all those that
[48:07] have been partakers in that may God
[48:09] bless you and and we love you in the
[48:11] Lord and we've been coming here now for
[48:13] quite a number of years we was trying to
[48:15] figure it up while ago I don't know 14
[48:17] 15 years something like that and you
[48:21] know I've seen some of you grow up
[48:24] and I've seen some of you grow gray
[48:28] but but nevertheless we're here together
[48:31] and you've watched me go bald and gray
[48:33] so uh
[48:35] you can't say a whole lot for that but
[48:37] we're just thankful to be part of the
[48:39] body of Christ tonight and trust and
[48:42] good to see you good to see you brother
[48:43] Chris and Sister Mary Sister Mary used
[48:46] to go to our church back a long time ago
[48:48] so
[48:49] I probably know her longer than anybody
[48:51] else in this room so we grew up together
[48:54] as kids in the same church and and you
[48:57] know what we're still pressing for the
[48:59] same goal
[49:00] and that's to get out of here in a
[49:02] Rapture and in a body change
[49:05] but we can't go in this thing
[49:07] I don't want to leave here like I am now
[49:11] I want a brand new body
[49:14] something that you know what I can run
[49:16] in heaven and the knees won't hurt
[49:20] I take off running right now I might
[49:22] need a stretcher but
[49:23] I get over there it won't be no need for
[49:25] a stretcher
[49:27] amen amen if you have your Bibles this
[49:30] evening turn with me to Philippians
[49:31] chapter 3.
[49:33] foreign
[49:39] Philippians chapter 3 and verse 13.
[49:54] Brethren I count not myself to have
[49:57] apprehended but this one thing I do
[50:00] forgetting those things which are behind
[50:05] so whatever happened back there
[50:07] forget it
[50:09] forget all your past
[50:11] don't go back and dwell on your past you
[50:14] can give testimony how God brought you
[50:16] forward but don't go back and live in
[50:18] the past
[50:20] but reaching forth unto those things
[50:23] which are before
[50:26] I press toward the mark for the prize of
[50:29] the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[50:32] God bless you this evening you can be
[50:34] seated
[50:35] hmm
[50:37] and I want to just take for a thought
[50:39] tonight
[50:40] if the Lord will help us on Not Looking
[50:42] Back
[50:44] God designed us so that we could look
[50:47] all around us
[50:49] but he placed your eyes in the front of
[50:51] your head and not the back of your head
[50:54] you're not like a frog tonight you don't
[50:56] look backwards
[50:58] we're looking forward
[51:00] and I've been a believer in His Garment
[51:03] doesn't have armor on the back of him
[51:06] that's what your brother behind you is
[51:09] for is to protect your back but we are
[51:12] Marching forward as the body of Christ
[51:16] we're not looking behind National
[51:17] Science scientists don't look back today
[51:20] at what some scientists said 300 years
[51:22] ago
[51:24] when they believed that you couldn't go
[51:26] over 35 miles an hour you would leave
[51:28] Earth because now you know that's
[51:30] obsolete because people travel in a
[51:33] couple of hundred miles an hour now and
[51:35] they keep pressing on
[51:37] and they don't stop
[51:40] they're always trying to break another
[51:43] barrier
[51:44] so science always points forward brother
[51:48] Brown said in one place he said if we're
[51:49] not careful scientists is going to find
[51:51] God before man
[51:54] so we don't want that to be us
[51:57] we want to keep looking forward
[52:01] says this he goes you know sometimes
[52:03] looking back we look back to see what
[52:05] Vinnie say
[52:07] say what Moody say and they're fine men
[52:12] but so was Moses and Joseph
[52:15] and that was another age
[52:17] now it's not that they didn't have some
[52:19] good things that they preached and they
[52:21] didn't have some truths of their day but
[52:24] this is an age of a different message
[52:27] and this message wouldn't have worked in
[52:29] their day and their message won't work
[52:32] in this day this is a new word
[52:36] we're going forward
[52:40] so if you want to know what he said look
[52:42] in the word
[52:43] what he said for your hour look in the
[52:46] scripture
[52:47] let's see what he said Jesus Christ is
[52:49] the same yesterday today and forever we
[52:52] know that so then if his word is still
[52:55] yet was good then his word is good
[52:57] tonight
[52:58] [Applause]
[52:59] if he ever healed one then he'll heal
[53:03] another one tonight if he ever gave the
[53:05] Holy Ghost then he's obligated to give
[53:08] it tonight
[53:10] whatever your need is
[53:15] he's obligated to supply it
[53:19] we can look around and look at the
[53:21] churches that's gone on
[53:23] and the day's gone by
[53:25] and if we're not careful we'll be living
[53:27] in a glare
[53:28] instead of the light
[53:31] and we're looking at something that's
[53:33] passed
[53:36] I heard a man preach years ago when I
[53:39] was a kid
[53:40] and he made this statement he said if
[53:42] you're not looking where you're going
[53:44] you'll be going where you're looking
[53:48] if you're going this way and you're
[53:50] looking that way
[53:51] you're going that way you'll eventually
[53:54] Veer off the path
[53:56] but we ain't here to Veer off the path
[53:58] we're here to stick with a message of
[54:01] the hour for this is what will put you
[54:04] in a body change
[54:06] [Applause]
[54:09] Glory you drive down the road and look
[54:12] in your rearview mirror
[54:15] you're gonna wreck
[54:18] I can barely drive going forward anyhow
[54:27] he ain't Rogue with me much
[54:30] foreign
[54:33] you can't look behind you you're looking
[54:36] in front of you
[54:38] if you're looking behind you you'll be
[54:39] going that way eventually you'll Veer
[54:41] off the path and want to go backwards
[54:44] listen but I ain't here to to compromise
[54:47] and go backwards I'm not here to give up
[54:50] on this message and say well maybe some
[54:53] other church has got something greater
[54:54] let me just tell you there is nothing
[54:57] greater than this message
[55:00] this message will Rapture you it will
[55:04] change you it will change your desires
[55:15] if this message won't change people and
[55:17] keep them
[55:18] run me out of the country
[55:21] and never let me back here again but I'm
[55:24] here to tell you tonight I bet you
[55:25] anything in the world this message will
[55:28] keep you change you change your desires
[55:32] [Applause]
[55:34] foreign
[55:35] [Applause]
[55:44] this is a changing
[55:46] word it transforms you
[55:49] it does not conform you it transforms
[55:52] you
[55:56] but now you know you take the natural
[55:58] side of that
[55:59] when people get older they all of a
[56:00] sudden want to look younger
[56:02] and when you're younger you want to look
[56:04] older
[56:05] you don't really want to look older
[56:07] you might think you do but once you get
[56:09] older you're like man I wish I was 20
[56:12] again
[56:15] huh
[56:17] it's coming to you
[56:20] and let me tell you something sister all
[56:22] the Botox in the world
[56:24] won't make you 16 years old again
[56:29] it'll just empty your pocketbook
[56:31] cost you a lot of money
[56:35] and you'll only look good for a season
[56:37] still yet
[56:39] but beauty is not on the outside that
[56:41] God's looking at
[56:43] God don't take his church and pump him
[56:45] up with a bunch of Botox so to speak and
[56:48] pump them up with everything of The
[56:50] World God takes his church and fills up
[56:53] with the word
[56:55] and the word then becomes expressed on
[56:59] the outside of the people
[57:01] [Applause]
[57:03] and when that happens
[57:05] when you heard that word actually
[57:07] expressed itself on the outside of the
[57:08] people you ain't got to preach all the
[57:10] time
[57:11] [Music]
[57:14] oh don't cut your hair don't wear your
[57:16] pants don't
[57:17] somewhere another you gotta grow up
[57:20] I realize everybody's on different
[57:22] stages and ministers have to minister in
[57:24] different areas for different things but
[57:26] as a majority of us we've been in the
[57:28] message long enough
[57:30] how many's been in the message five
[57:32] years or older over
[57:34] okay about 95 of you
[57:38] we have no excuse
[57:40] if you ain't been in a message at long
[57:41] you might have a reason
[57:43] but if you've been in a message 5 10 15
[57:45] 20 years you'll have no excuse
[57:49] not to know what the message says
[57:53] you have 1205 sermons you have on I'm
[57:56] telling how many books you can read the
[57:59] word you can dig in the word and you can
[58:01] become the word
[58:04] I can't give you a revelation that ain't
[58:06] in here
[58:07] [Applause]
[58:14] Jesus said you must be born again
[58:18] and Paul says
[58:19] in other words we're going to look
[58:21] forward
[58:22] we're going to forget what's in the past
[58:26] we all got to pass
[58:30] and maybe you were born in church
[58:32] put your bubble gum under the pews
[58:37] cut your teeth on the church pews I used
[58:39] to say we don't have pews anymore we
[58:42] have chairs
[58:43] don't gnaw on the nylon
[58:46] or the material you know it's not as
[58:48] easy as wood
[58:51] on your you know hit mess it up a little
[58:53] bit people can notice it more
[58:57] I remember sitting in church Sister Mary
[58:59] you remember this
[59:00] our church pews were old old pews way
[59:03] older than our church
[59:05] because we were poor in Arkansas
[59:07] we couldn't afford any other pews and if
[59:09] you put your hand under the edge
[59:12] there wasn't very many pews in the
[59:14] church or very many spots you couldn't
[59:15] find bubble gum
[59:18] I don't know what church they got that
[59:19] out of but they like gum
[59:24] why but we're grown up
[59:27] we're not cutting our teeth now on the
[59:29] Pew anymore
[59:31] listen we're up we ought to we ought to
[59:34] be up here
[59:35] experiencing the great things of God
[59:38] experiencing the Revival of the word
[59:42] that God has said into your heart
[59:45] and say the man-made Revival that God
[59:48] sent but it was the word that was
[59:50] restored that causes you to Rejoice that
[59:54] causes you to change
[1:00:00] so message of the hour
[1:00:09] usually a church gets mixed up he said
[1:00:11] and everything till when it comes time
[1:00:13] for the word to be fulfilled they're
[1:00:15] looking back at something else
[1:00:19] what was it like at Azusa Street
[1:00:21] I'm not living at azuzu Street
[1:00:25] that was a message for that day
[1:00:27] I'm living over here in the bright age
[1:00:30] I'm living here in the Rapture age I'm
[1:00:33] hearing the word age where it's time for
[1:00:36] me to take a change I
[1:00:38] get a change by going backwards
[1:00:42] and looking at the age before or before
[1:00:45] or before
[1:00:47] we appreciate those ages they all had
[1:00:50] partial truth
[1:00:52] but why in the world would you want to
[1:00:53] go back digging in something for
[1:00:55] personal truth when you had all the
[1:00:56] truth
[1:00:59] why do I want to go back I'll try to get
[1:01:02] that
[1:01:04] I'll try to behave
[1:01:08] your live stream now so
[1:01:10] you know I try to behave
[1:01:13] it won't matter okay
[1:01:19] if something tries to Sidetrack you
[1:01:22] and take you off the revealed word of
[1:01:24] the hour
[1:01:27] and point you back to another time
[1:01:31] watch it
[1:01:32] because that's the rear view mirror and
[1:01:34] you're gonna wreck soon
[1:01:36] because God wait listen when Wesley when
[1:01:39] Luther came up and had his life and then
[1:01:42] Wesley come up to there became wrecks
[1:01:45] brother I said you turned the corner and
[1:01:48] every time you turn the corner there's
[1:01:50] trouble
[1:01:51] there was trouble in Luther and Wesley's
[1:01:53] time there was trouble in Wesleyan
[1:01:54] Pentecostal time and there was trouble
[1:01:56] in this time when people left Pentecost
[1:01:59] and coming to the message
[1:02:01] because this message isn't Pentecostal
[1:02:03] denomination this message is the word
[1:02:07] being revealed in its power it doesn't
[1:02:11] do away with all the blessings of God
[1:02:13] but the thing is is now you got more
[1:02:20] you got what they had plus the truth
[1:02:24] you got more God just gives more and
[1:02:26] more and more Apostle Paul couldn't come
[1:02:28] and change his revelation
[1:02:32] he could only add to it
[1:02:34] and God ain't going to change his
[1:02:35] Revelation about this message
[1:02:38] this message has come in his fullness
[1:02:40] now it's just now that we're
[1:02:42] understanding parts of it
[1:02:45] it's been laid in there for 55 60 years
[1:02:48] now we're just understanding some things
[1:02:50] but it's always been there but it wasn't
[1:02:54] the hour of manifestation yet but in the
[1:02:57] hour of manifestation the bride begins
[1:03:00] to rejoice in it
[1:03:03] you grow in it
[1:03:07] man you don't want to go backwards
[1:03:11] all their stuff was fine in their day
[1:03:15] but we ain't in their day
[1:03:19] seats not over the shop
[1:03:21] brother says this neither will a
[1:03:23] Christian eat on that dead carrians from
[1:03:25] the old denominational doctrines and
[1:03:26] things they want the word of God
[1:03:29] fresh the promise of the hour God
[1:03:32] promised rabbits in the days of Luther
[1:03:33] and he promised other things in the days
[1:03:36] of others
[1:03:38] would you just go to a mill
[1:03:41] now if you're on a diet that's another
[1:03:43] story
[1:03:46] you go to a meal and a Mill's been
[1:03:48] prepared it's a seven course meal and
[1:03:50] you say oh they won't wrap it
[1:03:53] I don't want no vegetables
[1:03:55] I don't want no starches
[1:03:57] because I'm on Atkins or whatever
[1:04:00] and so you know but if you're just
[1:04:02] you're looking at it you don't want
[1:04:03] certain things
[1:04:04] but now in this day
[1:04:08] God promised you a seven course menu
[1:04:10] meal cause all the seals have been
[1:04:13] revealed and ready for those who can
[1:04:15] receive it
[1:04:17] so that when you receive the meal you're
[1:04:19] eating of everything that God has placed
[1:04:21] in there down through seven ages and all
[1:04:25] the Seven Seals that's been revealed
[1:04:26] he's opened them up and you are
[1:04:28] partaking of the book
[1:04:31] why do you want to go back to Luther's
[1:04:33] day
[1:04:35] when there's only rabbits on the table
[1:04:40] yeah guys we got it all
[1:04:43] no need to just going back and choosing
[1:04:44] one thing
[1:04:47] we get our Traditions wrapped up and you
[1:04:50] know what those all right for that day
[1:04:52] but Jesus said you search the scriptures
[1:04:55] see what's promised for your dead
[1:04:59] see what's in there
[1:05:02] trying to see what was in his day
[1:05:05] see the type of horse rider that went
[1:05:06] out in his day went to meet him exactly
[1:05:09] with the cunniness of man
[1:05:12] Reformation
[1:05:13] but this ain't the day of reformation
[1:05:16] this is the hour of restoration this is
[1:05:19] the hour when the word has been restored
[1:05:22] and when the world's been restored that
[1:05:24] in itself should make you rejoice
[1:05:30] foreign
[1:05:32] I like good music
[1:05:34] and I like shouting and I like praising
[1:05:37] the Lord
[1:05:38] but when the word comes forth
[1:05:42] that's your meat
[1:05:44] that's the meat of the word and that
[1:05:46] right there brother said after the
[1:05:48] service after the word has gone forth
[1:05:51] It's really the time to worship
[1:05:54] you've just plowed up the ground brother
[1:05:56] Andrew did get ready for the seed to
[1:05:59] come forth and when the word comes forth
[1:06:01] then he comes back and Waters it with
[1:06:03] his spirit
[1:06:05] and that's why when the word Goes Forth
[1:06:07] in his power and demonstration lives are
[1:06:11] changed
[1:06:15] it's a process
[1:06:18] search some scriptures
[1:06:21] well where are we living at them brother
[1:06:22] at the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:26] we're living at the very hour
[1:06:30] he could come at any moment
[1:06:34] and now you're all in trouble I forgot
[1:06:35] to hit my timer
[1:06:39] I have no clue how long I've been
[1:06:41] preaching already so I'm not going to
[1:06:42] worry about it
[1:06:43] you got an extra hour of sleep in the
[1:06:45] morning
[1:06:48] we didn't come here to operate my clocks
[1:06:50] we come here to operate by the spirit
[1:06:53] [Applause]
[1:06:57] I'm not long-winded normally so
[1:07:00] you can rest cities but you know what if
[1:07:02] he comes by we don't care
[1:07:04] see because we're not going to look back
[1:07:05] to some other year ago yeah you know he
[1:07:07] was too long back there
[1:07:10] what you're going to remember is what
[1:07:12] you take away
[1:07:14] and if somebody gets saved and somebody
[1:07:16] gets delivered and somebody receives the
[1:07:18] Holy Ghost that's what you need to take
[1:07:20] away from a service his lives were
[1:07:22] changed forever
[1:07:25] it's not just a putter this word lives
[1:07:33] we're not going back into history
[1:07:35] but we're in the writing writing but
[1:07:38] we're in the last moments of the world
[1:07:41] foreign
[1:07:42] writing history books he said won't be
[1:07:45] nobody here to read them
[1:07:47] bombs were fixing to fall
[1:07:49] well Justin don't scare me like that it
[1:07:51] don't scare me
[1:07:54] Russia having a bomb don't scare me
[1:07:58] Russia's threatening Obama America don't
[1:08:00] scare me
[1:08:01] Russia threatened to bomb America or to
[1:08:03] make you happy
[1:08:05] but brother listen I love my country I
[1:08:07] do too but this country's gotten rotten
[1:08:09] and it's turned us back on God and the
[1:08:12] only thing for us to do is leave here
[1:08:16] this world is not your home you're not
[1:08:19] destined to be an American you're
[1:08:21] destined to be the wife
[1:08:23] [Applause]
[1:08:30] Hallelujah
[1:08:34] they're already trying to shut it down
[1:08:37] try to shut the gospel down
[1:08:40] for just somebody not you know they're
[1:08:41] not trying to shut us down but they're
[1:08:43] trying to shut the Gospel Light off
[1:08:45] everywhere they go
[1:08:46] the nominations now allow whoever to
[1:08:49] preach they want to preach
[1:08:52] it don't matter if you're a trans or
[1:08:54] whatever
[1:08:56] they ordain you to preach
[1:08:59] they can ordain you all you want
[1:09:01] but the word don't ordain you
[1:09:05] and what the word says is truth
[1:09:08] and that's what we gotta stand on
[1:09:13] I'm not going backwards and it's
[1:09:15] compromising with a bunch of churches
[1:09:17] that want to take us backwards
[1:09:22] brother Jason this is my four no more I
[1:09:24] don't been in that system I ain't going
[1:09:25] back to that
[1:09:27] I don't been there where they told me
[1:09:29] there was only about four or five
[1:09:30] preachers that could preach the word I
[1:09:32] don't believe that God has men all
[1:09:35] around this message all around this
[1:09:38] world that preached the gospel it has
[1:09:41] power
[1:09:48] you can't limit God
[1:09:52] well
[1:09:54] brother we just don't have to listen to
[1:09:56] you oh yes true you don't
[1:09:58] but if you're in here tonight you get to
[1:10:03] you're not streaming me and you that's
[1:10:04] sitting here so you get to hear me
[1:10:07] so we just trust that something be said
[1:10:09] that encourages you
[1:10:12] the word's always right
[1:10:15] right
[1:10:16] look at when the two angels went down
[1:10:18] the Sodom
[1:10:20] let's look at lot and his wife just for
[1:10:22] a moment two angels go down to Sodom and
[1:10:25] they they show up at lot's house and lot
[1:10:27] let them in and it ain't long a bunch of
[1:10:29] men's knocking on the door
[1:10:31] who you got in there
[1:10:34] isn't that we've seen a couple of men
[1:10:35] come in
[1:10:39] the age we're living in
[1:10:41] well
[1:10:45] nothing nice trying to get to the angels
[1:10:49] and lot actually went outside and said
[1:10:52] take my virtuous daughters and do with
[1:10:55] them as you please
[1:10:58] what a state he'd Fallen to
[1:11:01] instead of saying get out of here
[1:11:04] and having a Godly backbone he had done
[1:11:07] coward down to give him his own
[1:11:09] daughters
[1:11:13] I think my daughters do with them as you
[1:11:15] please
[1:11:17] and the angel said I'll tell you what
[1:11:18] you're going to have to do lot you're
[1:11:19] gonna have to go to your son-in-law's
[1:11:21] you're gonna have to tell them
[1:11:24] we're leaving
[1:11:28] we're not staying here but we're leaving
[1:11:32] foreign
[1:11:33] well
[1:11:35] brother lot goes mayor a lot has been
[1:11:38] called is he goes to his son-in-law's
[1:11:40] and he says well you know what boys
[1:11:42] I got two men in my house that says
[1:11:43] they're going to destroy the city with
[1:11:45] fire and brimstone
[1:11:47] and we gotta leave
[1:11:49] and the two son-in-laws said we don't
[1:11:51] believe that message
[1:11:54] that's what they said we're not leaving
[1:11:57] so in other words they're saying we
[1:11:58] don't believe God sends Messengers
[1:12:03] we just don't believe it
[1:12:05] so he goes back to lot and he says now
[1:12:07] Lord take you and your wife and your two
[1:12:10] daughters
[1:12:11] your two virtuous daughters that's in
[1:12:12] your house and take them and get out and
[1:12:15] escape to the mountains
[1:12:18] and don't look behind you
[1:12:23] one simple phrase
[1:12:26] don't look back
[1:12:34] it's pretty simple sounds like
[1:12:38] and they get out there and
[1:12:40] lot begins bargaining with the angels
[1:12:43] don't send me to the mountains something
[1:12:46] will eat me up there
[1:12:48] let me go down to this little town it's
[1:12:50] a little town isn't it yeah it's a
[1:12:51] little town we'll go on down there then
[1:12:53] because lot was afraid to go to the
[1:12:54] mountains so he Bargains with the angels
[1:12:57] and they permitted him to do that
[1:13:00] that's what the Bible tells us
[1:13:03] but the key was get out of here and
[1:13:05] don't look back
[1:13:08] listen they were our example Abraham and
[1:13:12] Lauder
[1:13:13] and the word said don't look back so you
[1:13:16] will never get away from this as long as
[1:13:18] you win this life
[1:13:20] you're always going to hear these words
[1:13:22] don't look back don't look back don't
[1:13:25] look back Hebrews chapter 11 said these
[1:13:28] men are our examples they're a great
[1:13:30] cloud of witnesses around this so let us
[1:13:32] lay aside every week that does so easily
[1:13:34] beset us
[1:13:35] and let us run
[1:13:39] what are we gonna run a race
[1:13:42] you can't run a race in reverse
[1:13:46] you can only run a race going forward
[1:13:49] listen you're going around this track of
[1:13:52] life
[1:13:52] [Applause]
[1:13:54] good bad ugly
[1:13:57] everybody's tracks different
[1:14:01] we don't all get to say how we want it
[1:14:04] to go
[1:14:07] but here's the thing I want you to
[1:14:09] remember
[1:14:10] when somebody comes up and tells you and
[1:14:12] preach and tells you
[1:14:14] it doesn't matter if you you don't have
[1:14:17] to do it exactly
[1:14:19] that way
[1:14:21] brother Brian I'm or Paul or whoever
[1:14:23] didn't really mean it exactly that way
[1:14:26] that ought to be a red flag to you
[1:14:29] because Paul said don't let nobody
[1:14:31] change it or let him be a curse
[1:14:33] and the prophet said I preach what Paul
[1:14:35] preached
[1:14:37] so if somebody comes trying to turn you
[1:14:39] away from the Vindicated word leave them
[1:14:42] look at them and say I love your sister
[1:14:45] I love you brother but you ain't turning
[1:14:47] me back to what God brought me out of
[1:14:51] God brought me out of the world I ain't
[1:14:54] going back to the world
[1:14:56] God gave you the Holy Ghost you sure
[1:14:59] enough don't want to say God I don't
[1:15:01] want that Holy Ghost
[1:15:02] [Applause]
[1:15:06] some people don't want to get it because
[1:15:07] of the way I'll make them Act
[1:15:14] because sometimes they make you do
[1:15:16] things you don't want to do
[1:15:20] brother Jason y'all just get too excited
[1:15:24] scream too much
[1:15:26] where's Ali
[1:15:29] years ago she said why do you have to
[1:15:32] scream
[1:15:37] scream she's my buddy though
[1:15:42] I'm not I've had people at home go man
[1:15:45] and I'm not meaning to scream I'm
[1:15:47] meaning to get something to you this
[1:15:49] word lives
[1:15:51] and there ain't nothing out there worth
[1:15:53] treating this for
[1:15:55] there ain't no party there ain't no
[1:15:57] Honky Tonk there ain't no bar room
[1:15:59] you've ever been in that's ever better
[1:16:01] than what you're feeling right here
[1:16:02] tonight when the Holy Ghost comes by
[1:16:04] your way it will stimulate you it'll
[1:16:07] give you revelation
[1:16:09] brother Brown said I'm so glad that a
[1:16:11] man can be so drunk on the Holy Ghost
[1:16:13] till he's drunk every day of his life
[1:16:18] that don't mean he's always staggering
[1:16:25] cause you can be in the dumps
[1:16:28] and be drunk
[1:16:30] there's been days you've been down
[1:16:34] but you still drunk
[1:16:40] I remember sending a picture when they
[1:16:42] were doing the gamma knife
[1:16:43] radiation all those big things on his
[1:16:45] head
[1:16:47] but he's still drunk
[1:16:49] he was so drunk
[1:16:53] until there was a room full of people
[1:16:54] that emptied out
[1:16:58] and there was one man left
[1:17:03] and he said what do you need
[1:17:06] I'll just paraphrase this
[1:17:08] in other words brother Gabe said what
[1:17:10] you got
[1:17:13] that's the point of it I need what you
[1:17:16] got
[1:17:17] you can get it right here in a hospital
[1:17:20] room
[1:17:21] and let me tell you something thank God
[1:17:23] you ain't look back young man you keep
[1:17:26] pressing the battle there ain't nothing
[1:17:28] back there worth this right here there's
[1:17:30] nothing back there we're losing what
[1:17:32] God's already brought you through what
[1:17:34] he's already done for you don't give it
[1:17:37] up
[1:17:45] oh yeah
[1:17:47] devil will try to entice you
[1:17:52] let me just tell you what Jesus said
[1:17:55] remember Lot's wife
[1:17:57] remember Lot's wife
[1:18:00] all she did was looked over her shoulder
[1:18:04] that's all she done
[1:18:05] one word
[1:18:06] she disobeyed one word that she knew
[1:18:09] better
[1:18:10] but the prophet said she had a more of a
[1:18:13] right to look back than what you got
[1:18:16] because she had screaming grandchildren
[1:18:18] down there burning up in a fire
[1:18:21] doesn't make any mother want to turn her
[1:18:23] and look back but you ain't got
[1:18:25] grandchildren burning in a fire
[1:18:28] not yet anyhow
[1:18:31] so the thing for you to do is press on
[1:18:33] press forward forget the things that's
[1:18:36] behind Lord you know my children out
[1:18:37] there in sin I give them to you I claim
[1:18:40] them in the name of Jesus I'm marching
[1:18:42] forward I ain't turning back I'm not
[1:18:45] going to go back and
[1:18:48] I'm not gonna go compromise with my kids
[1:18:50] and sin
[1:18:55] I'm going to preach the same gospel
[1:19:00] her heart was broken
[1:19:03] she turned and looked back
[1:19:05] once you go to looking back from the
[1:19:07] word
[1:19:10] excuse me it's been restored to you
[1:19:12] you'll miss where the spirit's leading
[1:19:13] you at today
[1:19:16] we've turned the corner
[1:19:19] in the Rapture message brother I'm says
[1:19:21] we're at a corner
[1:19:22] leadership two days later he goes we
[1:19:25] turn the corner
[1:19:28] in two days time he finished the corner
[1:19:34] and in a couple more days he's gone
[1:19:37] because it took a real master builder
[1:19:41] anybody can lay a wall
[1:19:44] but it took a master builder to turn the
[1:19:48] corner and when he turned that corner
[1:19:52] if I could just give you this
[1:19:54] illustration you could see it
[1:19:57] let me do it like this
[1:19:59] come hold this microphone
[1:20:02] I can't preach and draw too
[1:20:06] justification
[1:20:08] sanctification
[1:20:10] right Pentecost he said gifts restored
[1:20:14] all right now we're at a corner
[1:20:17] and he said we've turned the corner
[1:20:19] and we're looking towards heaven
[1:20:23] we're looking up
[1:20:25] We're Not Looking Back we're not looking
[1:20:28] to the right we're not looking to the
[1:20:31] left they can't we're looking upward
[1:20:34] listen he's coming back like he said and
[1:20:38] The Church Must Be resurrected soon and
[1:20:40] be ready to go so our eyes are on Glory
[1:20:48] my eyes ain't on this world and what
[1:20:50] this world has to offer because they
[1:20:51] don't have nothing to offer
[1:20:58] all right just so now I'm going to read
[1:20:59] something to you
[1:21:01] who means ever been tempted to go back
[1:21:03] and do things
[1:21:05] that you used to do just be honest
[1:21:07] you can all be honest because I got a
[1:21:09] quote says you all have
[1:21:13] I'm not going to try to trick you I'll
[1:21:15] just tell you from we've all did it
[1:21:18] all right we're sometimes tempted to go
[1:21:21] back
[1:21:22] many of you tempted to go back to the
[1:21:23] domination go back and take up because
[1:21:26] of the world says what denomination you
[1:21:28] belong to
[1:21:29] what church you affiliated with we're
[1:21:31] tempted to do that all of us are
[1:21:35] our sisters are tempted to go back
[1:21:38] go back and join up with some of the
[1:21:39] rest of the churches some of the
[1:21:41] assemblies some of the Church of Gods or
[1:21:43] some of them still be Pentecostal
[1:21:46] but they let you cut your hair
[1:21:48] and you dress any way you want to you're
[1:21:51] tempted to do that
[1:21:54] to go back to be popular in this wicked
[1:21:57] generation that we're living with
[1:22:00] you're tempted
[1:22:04] and he goes on and says and the major
[1:22:05] sin of our day is worldliness
[1:22:08] escalator of sin age she's rich
[1:22:11] Needham has a need of nothing and don't
[1:22:13] know that she's naked wretched miserable
[1:22:15] blind that's the center of our day and
[1:22:18] when you hear the word of God call out
[1:22:20] against it then you take the other route
[1:22:24] you're unpopular with the world
[1:22:28] and you're tempted sometimes he said to
[1:22:31] go back
[1:22:33] you're in the path of Duty walking along
[1:22:36] serving God
[1:22:37] and the devil tempts you
[1:22:42] when you just like to go back
[1:22:46] not really
[1:22:49] the devil might try to put those
[1:22:51] thoughts there
[1:22:52] but if you stop and entertain them
[1:22:55] there's where you're gonna get in
[1:22:57] trouble
[1:22:58] you'll end up like Nelly Sanders did
[1:23:00] that time
[1:23:01] remember her she was the best
[1:23:03] dancer her and Leo was in the country
[1:23:05] and she got there and and you know what
[1:23:07] she come to brother bam she come down
[1:23:09] the altar one night she just come in the
[1:23:11] back door stumbled down the hill altar
[1:23:13] brother random I need Jesus he said
[1:23:16] Nelly he's right here all you got to do
[1:23:18] is accept him on the basis of the word
[1:23:20] she accepted him she prayed through she
[1:23:22] got up she rejoiced
[1:23:26] but about six months later
[1:23:29] she's walking down Spring Street
[1:23:33] and she heard by the music call
[1:23:36] and she heard that old music going again
[1:23:40] well Jason I never would have stopped
[1:23:42] okay let me just see how self-righteous
[1:23:43] you are
[1:23:45] have you ever been in a restaurant
[1:23:49] and I saw him come on
[1:23:52] Mr listen do
[1:23:55] now how many is Holy
[1:24:00] without God we're all lost
[1:24:04] of course the devil gets in your memory
[1:24:07] and takes you back to when you used to
[1:24:09] listen to country music or rock and roll
[1:24:11] or whatever it was and that song will
[1:24:13] stay in your mind all day
[1:24:16] and you'll catch yourself throughout the
[1:24:18] day humming and you're like what in the
[1:24:21] book cause that memory part's still
[1:24:22] there
[1:24:23] see the Soul's been cleansed
[1:24:25] but the memory Still Remains
[1:24:29] he don't necessarily wash your memory
[1:24:31] clean he washes your soul clean
[1:24:34] because we're still humans and we'll
[1:24:37] still make mistakes
[1:24:41] I never really was
[1:24:43] well I just walk up on the steps
[1:24:46] and
[1:24:48] listen just a little bit maybe I get a
[1:24:49] chance to witness to somebody
[1:24:52] she's on the devil's territory
[1:24:54] but she goes up there and the next thing
[1:24:56] she finds herself in the arms of a man
[1:24:58] dancing on the floor again and she comes
[1:25:00] to herself and she runs to the place
[1:25:03] where she knew she could get help
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:08] cab door shuts
[1:25:12] brother branham's babysitting
[1:25:14] I say babysitting but
[1:25:16] adult sitting
[1:25:18] a buddy of his named William blessglow
[1:25:21] he's a drunk
[1:25:24] and brother Brandon rescued him that
[1:25:25] night Gabe so you wouldn't pick him up
[1:25:31] or somebody in your in your Workforce
[1:25:34] that's why he took him home put him in
[1:25:36] the bed
[1:25:38] Wayne why do you do these things oh
[1:25:41] Don't Preach to me Bill
[1:25:46] wasn't long enough comes knocking on the
[1:25:48] door he goes to the door it's Nelly
[1:25:49] brother right now I'm lost I don't know
[1:25:52] what's happened I'm done he goes what's
[1:25:54] wrong Nelly you're having a heart attack
[1:25:55] no what's the matter until she tells him
[1:25:58] the story
[1:26:00] he said Nelly you just messed up when
[1:26:02] you stopped to listen
[1:26:04] he said now I hadn't been preaching but
[1:26:06] about a year
[1:26:07] he said but I said I believe there's
[1:26:09] something in the Bible
[1:26:11] that says in the name of Jesus they
[1:26:14] shall cast out devils
[1:26:16] so he starts praying he goes now Satan
[1:26:18] whoever you are you have no right to my
[1:26:21] sister
[1:26:23] and he said God is my witness the screen
[1:26:25] store started shutting and slamming and
[1:26:28] they said what's that he said I have no
[1:26:29] idea
[1:26:30] but he kept praying and he said in the
[1:26:32] name of Jesus Christ leave this woman
[1:26:34] and when that demon come out of her like
[1:26:37] a bat with long hair went over behind
[1:26:39] the bed Wayne went out of the bed he got
[1:26:41] sober all of a sudden
[1:26:43] he jumped out of the bed his mama shook
[1:26:47] the sheets
[1:26:48] but you know what Nelly was restored
[1:26:51] now they just made a mistake she wasn't
[1:26:54] lost
[1:26:59] she just got sidetracked
[1:27:03] and when you're right in the line of
[1:27:04] duty and an obstacle sometimes to lay in
[1:27:07] your way
[1:27:08] like it did to children of Israel when
[1:27:09] they got ready to cross the Red Sea
[1:27:13] and you know what they started to look
[1:27:14] back
[1:27:16] we'd have been better off in Egypt
[1:27:21] oh no
[1:27:23] no I'm not better off in Egypt
[1:27:27] I don't want to go back to Egypt
[1:27:30] I'm not going back to Egypt
[1:27:32] and God began to work on Moses
[1:27:36] and he tells Moses
[1:27:38] fear struck the people
[1:27:40] and what they wanted they didn't know
[1:27:42] what to do and brothers says this
[1:27:44] because that's the way people does today
[1:27:45] when fear strikes them when they're
[1:27:47] writing the path to duty listen brother
[1:27:49] let me say this if you're walking in the
[1:27:51] light
[1:27:53] key number one
[1:27:55] Heaven fellowship with God key number
[1:27:58] two
[1:27:59] with his people key number three
[1:28:02] and the Holy Spirit is upon you
[1:28:05] four things
[1:28:07] and you mean an obstacle five things
[1:28:14] God's grace is going to be sufficient
[1:28:17] and you mean an obstacle right in the
[1:28:19] path of Duty don't stop
[1:28:25] keep pressing on press into the mark of
[1:28:29] a hot calling remember keep pressing on
[1:28:31] God Will Make A Way through it that's
[1:28:33] one of the greatest experiences of my
[1:28:35] life is to see God when I can't get over
[1:28:37] it I can't get under it I can't get
[1:28:39] around that God makes a way through it
[1:28:42] somehow another his grace is sufficient
[1:28:48] so when you're in the bath
[1:28:51] and you're doing all the things God told
[1:28:52] you to do
[1:28:54] you're following the word you stand up
[1:28:56] and watch it open up
[1:28:58] you don't turn back and quit then
[1:29:05] I don't have to tell you what this man's
[1:29:07] been through
[1:29:09] but has he turned back
[1:29:12] you can write
[1:29:14] a book this slick
[1:29:16] on all the things he has been through
[1:29:20] and he never turned back
[1:29:23] and he never quit following the message
[1:29:25] and he never quit serving God
[1:29:29] and even though he was weak many times
[1:29:31] he still yet knew in whom he had
[1:29:33] believed
[1:29:35] and that's why he's sitting here tonight
[1:29:37] is cause he didn't turn back he didn't
[1:29:40] quit trying he didn't quit believing and
[1:29:44] you can't quit trying you can't quit
[1:29:46] believing you got to press on little
[1:29:49] bride
[1:29:53] press the battle
[1:29:57] don't quit
[1:30:00] things get tough don't quit then
[1:30:05] Press On
[1:30:07] you look back we don't want to be
[1:30:08] identified as frogs
[1:30:12] three unclean spirits went out of them
[1:30:15] we want to keep pressing through the
[1:30:16] anointed word of the hour
[1:30:19] because the devil's got a false anoint
[1:30:20] him one and he tries to Sidetrack us
[1:30:23] with it
[1:30:26] you know brother Ram said it would be so
[1:30:28] close
[1:30:29] the Bible tells us still to see the very
[1:30:31] elect
[1:30:32] so then it's not
[1:30:34] some nominal group going to deceive you
[1:30:40] as somebody Among Us
[1:30:42] trying
[1:30:44] brother man said so much like the real
[1:30:49] till he even said it was a Pentecostal
[1:30:51] movement like the real
[1:30:53] and a Pentecostal Spirit like for real
[1:30:56] so the devil's you know what you say
[1:30:58] well Brothers yes I'm having a great
[1:30:59] time in God the devil's sat there beside
[1:31:02] you
[1:31:05] every Revival produces twins
[1:31:08] you just gotta know which one you are
[1:31:10] and if you stay with this word you know
[1:31:13] which one you are you're identified in
[1:31:16] this word and this word will be your
[1:31:18] breath it'll be your life it'll be your
[1:31:20] everyday everyday meat it'll be more to
[1:31:24] you than life itself

[1:31:37] it'll keep you
[1:31:39] when everything else is Fallen

[1:31:46] but the devil going to try to take you
[1:31:47] back
[1:31:50] well brother Jason you know I one time
[1:31:52] you know I had a guy he was my neighbor
[1:31:54] of mine I may have told this here before
[1:31:55] but
[1:31:58] he come to me one day and he said
[1:31:59] actually I went to his house I was
[1:32:02] visiting about something
[1:32:03] and he says you don't believe in the
[1:32:05] initial evidence do you
[1:32:08] are not like him
[1:32:13] he said what do you think it is I said
[1:32:16] well for one let me see your life
[1:32:20] see if your life lines up with the word
[1:32:23] he says are you saying I ain't got it
[1:32:26] I said I didn't say that
[1:32:29] I mean he was living with a woman that
[1:32:30] wasn't even his wife
[1:32:33] and wanting to tell me he had the
[1:32:34] initial evidence
[1:32:36] listen church I'll tell you the evidence
[1:32:39] and Prophet said the true evidence of
[1:32:40] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is being
[1:32:42] able to say Amen to every word of God
[1:32:45] not just with lips only but with your
[1:32:48] life
[1:32:49] and if your life can say Amen to it and
[1:32:53] line up to it you Hey listen there ain't
[1:32:56] no better evidence than that
[1:32:57] [Applause]
[1:33:00] we love all the things that come with it
[1:33:04] we love the rejoice in the worship the
[1:33:07] and this is part of the blessings of God
[1:33:09] that he gives us
[1:33:10] and anybody in their right mind enjoys
[1:33:12] it
[1:33:14] if you don't enjoy it something's wrong
[1:33:18] brother Jason I think we should all come
[1:33:20] to church
[1:33:22] quite as a church mouse
[1:33:24] well even the church mouse squeaks every
[1:33:26] once in a while
[1:33:32] anyhow

[1:33:38] huh
[1:33:39] foreign
[1:33:40] we're not looking for a false we're
[1:33:42] looking for the real
[1:33:44] the false is here but we're thrill we're
[1:33:47] not interested in somebody's made-up
[1:33:49] thing we're looking for what the word
[1:33:50] produces
[1:33:52] you want a word Revival it's here but
[1:33:55] you have to step into it and become it
[1:33:58] and believe it
[1:34:03] whatever you do
[1:34:05] don't look back to something outside of
[1:34:09] the Vindicated word
[1:34:13] stay in it
[1:34:16] Ruth
[1:34:17] don't leave the field
[1:34:19] stay in it
[1:34:22] and when she found the man she was
[1:34:24] looking for
[1:34:25] he stayed in the field
[1:34:27] she wasn't going back
[1:34:29] Naomi said Ruth why don't you go back
[1:34:31] with or if I can go back oh no no no no

[1:34:43] is that should be my church
[1:34:45] your people your Prophet whatever you
[1:34:48] have I want it to be mine
[1:34:52] he finds boaz's field
[1:34:54] and she rests
[1:34:57] when she goes to the threshing floor
[1:35:01] he only says now he's a near Kinsman but
[1:35:03] here's what you got to do you gotta go

[1:35:24] because gradually eventually he's going
[1:35:26] to wake up
[1:35:27] and he's going to say who's at my feet
[1:35:31] I'm Ruth
[1:35:34] you're my near Kinsman

[1:35:41] price of your Redemption and she rested
[1:35:45] on that
[1:35:47] and this bride is at the feet of the
[1:35:49] Lord Jesus and we're resting on that

[1:36:09] keep walking in the path of Duty
[1:36:17] brother makes a statement in Oneness he
[1:36:19] says
[1:36:19] a real true servant and feel humble and
[1:36:22] feel stumble he'll get up again
[1:36:25] if he wobbles God pulls him right back
[1:36:28] in the path
[1:36:29] as long as he's in the path of Duty
[1:36:33] but if he's off the path to duty God's
[1:36:34] not obligated to him
[1:36:37] but as long as he's in the path of Duty
[1:36:38] God's obligated to him knowing he's just
[1:36:40] a man or a woman he's obligated to that
[1:36:43] person excuse me as long as they're in
[1:36:45] the path of Duty as long as you're
[1:36:47] walking in the light worshiping God in
[1:36:50] the light
[1:36:52] and you make a mistake like Nelly
[1:36:55] get back up
[1:36:58] humble yourself
[1:37:02] come back to church
[1:37:05] don't quit Church
[1:37:08] presentation but the preachers are all
[1:37:09] mad at me and they'll listen don't
[1:37:11] listen to The Devil he's lying to you
[1:37:13] that's just a lie of the enemy nobody
[1:37:16] here hates one another we're in this
[1:37:18] thing together
[1:37:20] [Applause]
[1:37:21] we're trying to get out of here in a
[1:37:23] rapture
[1:37:25] thank you
[1:37:28] we're here to defeat the Devil
[1:37:31] don't stop and look back you keep
[1:37:33] marching forward in the path of Duty
[1:37:35] you just remember this
[1:37:38] eternity hinges on this word
[1:37:42] and if eternity hinges on it you can
[1:37:44] hinge on it
[1:37:47] and you can rest assured
[1:37:49] this word ain't going nowhere
[1:37:53] this word is perfect
[1:37:55] it don't need no interpreter
[1:37:59] it don't need you to tell me what it
[1:38:01] says I don't need to have to tell you
[1:38:03] what it says you know what it says you
[1:38:07] know when God's speaking to you you know
[1:38:09] when the words going for it God's
[1:38:11] deserting you you know that I don't have
[1:38:13] to tell you you already know
[1:38:19] long as you're in that line of duty
[1:38:22] and keeping God's word if you say to
[1:38:25] this mountain
[1:38:29] but if I quit and I look back
[1:38:34] I lose that Authority
[1:38:39] but as long as I'm in the line of duty I
[1:38:41] can say to this mountain
[1:38:42] be thou removed
[1:38:44] and don't doubt but believe it with all
[1:38:46] my heart and I can have what I ask for
[1:38:50] program said sometimes we're just afraid
[1:38:52] to use it
[1:38:53] we get to the place we're afraid he
[1:38:55] won't keep his word
[1:38:59] he will keep his word cause he said he
[1:39:03] would
[1:39:05] Hallelujah that ought to be good enough
[1:39:07] God said he'd keep his word he'll keep
[1:39:10] his word
[1:39:14] I was telling the brother's day we have
[1:39:15] a sister at church she
[1:39:17] she was there to message of the future
[1:39:18] home
[1:39:19] and brother Branham calls her out she's
[1:39:21] the second lady her name's Mrs Alexander
[1:39:24] and brother Brahm calls her out
[1:39:26] and he says you have you've been praying
[1:39:28] and she had prayed but she was also
[1:39:31] thinking Lord let this man hurry up
[1:39:33] because I'm smothering because it was so
[1:39:35] hot in there
[1:39:36] but God never mentioned
[1:39:39] that
[1:39:42] he said you're praying you live at a
[1:39:45] certain address up by Chicago
[1:39:47] you have a thyroid condition you're
[1:39:50] healed and you know what she couldn't
[1:39:52] have any more children she had three
[1:39:54] more now I'll let the church with her
[1:39:55] today
[1:39:56] you know why because God's still a
[1:39:58] Healer
[1:39:59] but you got to keep the word years later
[1:40:01] probably about 10 years ago she she had
[1:40:03] to go back on thyroid medicine she's
[1:40:05] sitting in her living room one day and
[1:40:07] the Lord spoke to her and he said didn't
[1:40:09] I heal you of this once before
[1:40:12] she said yeah you did Lord and she took
[1:40:14] the pills and threw them away and her
[1:40:16] thyroid has been perfect ever since
[1:40:19] [Applause]
[1:40:28] if you say
[1:40:30] you're in the line of duty you ain't
[1:40:32] looking back you're looking forward
[1:40:38] I'm going to read this quote I don't
[1:40:40] have a clue how long I've been here but
[1:40:41] he says now you Christian tonight you're
[1:40:44] in a line of duty
[1:40:45] you're trying to follow the leading of
[1:40:47] the Holy Spirit
[1:40:49] and a cancer grabbed you
[1:40:53] death grabs you
[1:40:55] a cancer TB whatever it is
[1:40:58] in the line of duty you have the same
[1:41:00] right that Peter had
[1:41:05] what was that brother Jason Lord
[1:41:08] save me lest I perish
[1:41:11] in desperation he called out and hand
[1:41:15] reached and picked him up
[1:41:17] you have the same thing but he screamed
[1:41:20] out Lord Save Me Lord he heard my
[1:41:23] despairing cry and from the waters
[1:41:26] Lifted Me Now safe am I
[1:41:29] that's what it is when you cry out
[1:41:33] Lord save me
[1:41:36] God has looked back but saved me God I
[1:41:39] failed you but save me
[1:41:41] [Applause]
[1:41:45] and he says Lord maybe this woman or
[1:41:47] whoever it is this grandson or nephew
[1:41:50] cried out an inspiring God heard
[1:41:52] then we find out that in Sinking God
[1:41:54] heard him
[1:41:56] he failed no matter if you fail but you
[1:42:00] don't have nothing to do with it we all
[1:42:02] fail we're a failure to begin with but
[1:42:04] somebody's standing now with a strong
[1:42:07] hand
[1:42:09] that can reach down his hand for you
[1:42:12] and when you make mistakes his arm is
[1:42:14] there
[1:42:19] he's not going to let you fall
[1:42:23] he said Lord these handkerchiefs I got
[1:42:25] my hands laid on but sick and afflicted
[1:42:27] Satan has crossed their line
[1:42:31] and is hindering them in the line of
[1:42:34] duty
[1:42:37] Satan crossed your line
[1:42:42] and hindering you
[1:42:44] in the path of Duty let the power that
[1:42:48] raised up the Lord
[1:42:51] who's present now come upon these
[1:42:54] handkerchiefs and whoever they touch May
[1:42:56] the devil get scared
[1:43:01] oh don't worry devil gets scared while
[1:43:03] he looks down through the blood of Jesus
[1:43:06] Christ and may every one of them be
[1:43:08] healed and continue on their path of
[1:43:10] Duty granted Lord
[1:43:13] and anytime the Devil comes at you and
[1:43:16] you're an apothe Duty
[1:43:19] you have a right to tell the devil
[1:43:23] I'm in the path of Duty
[1:43:25] I'm Not Looking Back I'm not giving in
