[30:12] cannot fail.
[30:14] And after midnight,
[30:17] God sent an earthquake.
[30:20] And those foundations
[30:22] began to shake.
[30:25] Those prison doors
[30:29] flew open wide. And Paul and Silas

[31:46] hand.
[31:48] And he went running
[31:51] to beat that army.
[31:54] Even at that time man that stood mighty
[31:59] and tall and he said I come

[33:15] he wore a breastplate.
[33:18] Oh, and the sword of the spirit was in
[33:22] his hand.
[33:24] Oh, and he went running
[33:27] to meet that devil.
[33:30] He met that stupid old cancer
[33:34] [Music]
[33:35] instant tall. And he said, "I come
[33:40] in the name of the Lord." and that
[33:44] cancer
[33:45] had fall.
[33:48] He will deliver me in my time of peace.
[33:55] Like those Hebrew Hebrew children from
[33:58] the fire heal free. Like he fed 5,000
[34:04] with two fishes and bread. And he walked
[34:09] on the water
[34:11] and he raised the dead and he stood by
[34:15] Daniel in the lion's d. And he saved
[34:22] Moses from Pharaoh's men.
[34:26] He opened the eyes of the blind to see.
[34:33] And I know that he'll deliver. I know
[34:36] that he'll deliver.
[34:39] I know that he'll deliver me.
[34:45] [Music]
[34:47] [Applause]
[34:50] That's awesome.
[34:52] Come, sister. Praise the Lord.
[37:20] [Applause]
[37:29] [Music]
[37:37] Somewhere
[37:39] Somebody
[37:42] is praying
[37:45] tonight
[37:47] for a love
[37:50] who wanders
[37:53] away from the light.
[37:58] But faith
[38:00] reaches heaven.
[38:04] And God is aware.
[38:09] And forever
[38:12] it's changed
[38:14] in one moment
[38:16] [Music]
[38:17] of prayer. Oh, there's power
[38:22] in prayer.
[38:25] There's power
[38:28] to spare.
[38:30] And all that you ever need is waiting
[38:38] right there.
[38:41] A few words,
[38:43] a child's faith, then it's goodbye
[38:49] despair. Oh, there is power. There's so
[38:54] much power.
[38:57] There's power
[38:59] in prayer.
[39:02] [Music]
[39:05] An old man holds a body
[39:10] that's per
[39:16] [Music]
[39:18] tried,
[39:20] but all hope
[39:23] is in vain.
[39:25] Oh, but wait. There's somebody praying
[39:31] in the midst of the gloom.
[39:35] And all at once, the greatest physician,
[39:41] he steps in the room. Oh, there is power
[39:49] in prayer.
[39:52] There's power
[39:54] to spare
[39:57] and all that you'll ever need
[40:02] is waiting
[40:05] right there
[40:07] with a few words.
[40:10] A child's faith in its goodbye
[40:15] despair. Oh, there is power. There's so
[40:21] much power.
[40:23] There's power
[40:26] in prayer. Oh, there is power
[40:32] in prayer.
[40:34] There's power
[40:37] to spare.
[40:40] And all that you'd ever need is waiting
[40:47] right there.
[40:50] With a few words,
[40:53] a child's faith, then it's good by
[40:58] despair. Oh, there is power. There's so
[41:03] much power.
[41:06] There's power
[41:09] in prayer.
[41:12] Only
[41:15] believe.
[41:18] Oh,
[41:20] we believe
[41:24] that all things
[41:27] are possible.

[41:36] Only
[41:38] believe.
[41:41] Only

[41:47] that all things
[41:49] are possible.
[41:53] Only
[41:55] believe.
[41:59] Lord,
[42:01] I believe.
[42:04] Lord,
[42:06] I believe
[42:10] that all things
[42:12] they're possible.
[42:15] Lord, I believe.
[42:21] Lord,
[42:23] I believe.
[42:27] Lord,
[42:29] I believe
[42:32] that all things
[42:35] they're possible.
[42:39] Lord, I
[42:41] believe
[42:45] [Music]
[42:48] [Applause]
[43:26] [Music]
[43:34] Jesus has a table spread where the
[43:38] saints of God fed. He invites his chosen
[43:42] people to come and die.
[43:46] Oh, with his land he does fe and
[43:50] supplies our every need for to sweet us

[44:24] The disciples came to land. Thus the
[44:28] main Christ

[44:34] die.
[44:36] Oh, they laid down their hearts desire.
[44:40] Bread and fish are upon the fire. Thus
[44:44] he satisfies the hungry every time

[46:52] [Music]
[46:56] [Applause]
[47:03] God bless you.
[47:05] God bless you.
[47:07] God bless you.
[47:09] If I keep saying God bless you, you'll
[47:11] get it.
[47:13] Amen. Happy Father's Day.
[47:16] Amen. But to be a father, happy Mother's
[47:19] Day.
[47:21] Amen. Amen. Thank you. Good to see you.
[47:25] Amen. Brother Joel, the wife. So good to
[47:27] see you guys. Just was with you guys
[47:29] last week and so
[47:32] hallelujah.
[47:34] Isn't that a great day?
[47:36] We're so glad to see each and every one
[47:38] of you. And uh want you just look over
[47:40] at your name and say, "Brother Ron loves
[47:42] you.
[47:46] I really mean it."
[47:49] Amen. It makes a big difference if you
[47:52] really mean it. A lot of people can just
[47:54] tongue and cheek it, but when you really
[47:56] mean it, it means something for you. So,
[47:59] you know, when you when you love
[48:01] someone, you go the extra mile. And so,
[48:04] we're just so thankful for where we're
[48:05] at. I don't know if you're paying
[48:07] attention to the news, but we're getting
[48:10] ready to go home.
[48:13] Yeah. That's that's that's just where
[48:15] we're at.
[48:22] And this is not just a little skirmish
[48:24] that is going on. And uh uh we are we're
[48:28] at a place where we've got two major
[48:30] nations deciding one of your going. And
[48:34] so I bet on Israel.
[48:39] I I just that's if you're choosing the
[48:42] other side probably we we probably need
[48:44] to talk.
[48:46] And so and so I I just that's Ishmael's
[48:49] children and you got to you got to pick
[48:51] the right one here. So and so we just
[48:54] believe we just believe with all of our
[48:56] hearts. And so this is the nation that
[48:58] has actually fought against Israel all
[49:01] these years and skirmished with them
[49:02] using other countries to do it. And now
[49:05] now these two have come together for the
[49:08] fight. And so we don't know where this
[49:10] leads us,
[49:12] but somewhere or another, as I was
[49:14] thinking about it last night, and Connie
[49:16] and I were speaking of it, there's
[49:18] 144,000
[49:21] believers in Israel.
[49:24] And there's two prophets that are coming
[49:26] that's going to preach to them the
[49:29] message
[49:31] of Jesus Christ. And so there's 144,000
[49:35] that are going to be there that's going
[49:37] to hear it. And God is responsible to
[49:41] them.
[49:43] He's responsible to them as much as he's
[49:46] responsible to you.
[49:50] You know, we think about ourselves so
[49:51] much and we are we're in every nation,
[49:55] but but let me just say, God is just as
[49:58] responsible to them as to as to us.
[50:01] Amen. And so Israel cannot get
[50:04] extinguished. And that's what the
[50:05] world's calling for again.
[50:08] It's in our nation. We're we're eat up
[50:11] with it. But listen, you can't destroy
[50:14] the seed of God. And so no more than you
[50:18] can destroy this bride.
[50:20] I like to say it, God's on our side.
[50:33] Amen. We certainly love you with all of
[50:35] our hearts and so so grateful to have
[50:39] you with us. And we want to pray for
[50:41] brother Andrew. Brother Andrew will be
[50:43] going to to San Diego next week to speak
[50:47] for the Spanish groups that are there.
[50:50] And some of them are just brand new. And
[50:52] so we are we are we are certainly we've
[50:56] met a lot of them and uh and they told
[50:58] brother Andrew said because he's going
[51:00] in some of that nonsense area and so
[51:03] they told him said Andrew you'll be okay
[51:06] you're with Mexicans.
[51:08] [Applause]
[51:26] I'm not going to get too much on
[51:27] politics, but
[51:30] we're all immigrants, too.
[51:33] We're from another world. And so, we're
[51:36] just here for a little while. And no
[51:38] matter what nation you're from, we're
[51:40] we're from another place. And so, Amen.
[51:43] We pray that God sends a revival there.
[51:46] Amen. Then, Brother Matt's going to be
[51:48] going to the youth camp at Ohio and he's
[51:51] going to be speaking the first service
[51:53] there. So, that's a that's a keynote
[51:55] speaker. And so, I I I'm praying for him
[51:58] as well. And and I'm going to be with
[52:01] you here at home. And so, we're so we're
[52:09] so we're
[52:13] Amen. So, you're going to get a double
[52:15] dose of me next week. Saturday and
[52:17] Sunday. So, Amen. So, God bless you.
[52:22] Would you stand?
[52:25] Amen. Amen. Certainly good to greet you.
[52:29] It just feels like you. What a wonderful
[52:31] atmosphere that's here this morning. And
[52:34] and so we're just so we're so thankful
[52:37] for what God is doing. Amen. Maybe maybe
[52:40] you just maybe lay your hand on your
[52:44] neighbor. And all of us have needs. I
[52:48] have needs. You have needs. We've got a
[52:51] lot of people with incredible needs. And
[52:54] Brother Van would do that many times.
[52:56] Said, "Lay your hand on your neighbor
[52:57] and let's pray." And so phenomenal
[53:01] miracles have happened in moments like
[53:04] these. And so you have a need, let's
[53:07] just talk to the Lord about it just now
[53:10] and ask him to come on a in a special
[53:12] way, especially for Dave and Jerry's
[53:15] father. I plan to see him this afternoon
[53:17] and I got a I got a mission, brother
[53:20] Jerry. I'm on a mission. So, Amen. I
[53:23] eternal, but things are at stake there.
[53:25] And so,
[53:27] Father, we love you today.
[53:30] [Music]
[53:32] There's just not words in the English
[53:34] language that we can say
[53:38] of how much that we love you.
[53:42] Songs have been written and powerful
[53:45] sermons have been preached.
[53:48] But I ask you today
[53:51] that you would touch your children as we
[53:54] lay hands on one another. All of us have
[53:56] needs.
[53:58] [Music]
[53:59] And Lord, whether it's physical,
[54:02] financial, spiritual,
[54:04] [Music]
[54:05] mental, whatever it is, Father, you're a
[54:08] God bigger than our need.
[54:11] And Lord, today I I we have lost loved
[54:15] ones that we want to see come in.
[54:19] I don't want to see nobody lost. That's
[54:21] not That's not who we are.
[54:25] I ask you to send your word and deal
[54:27] with their hearts.
[54:28] May the angel of God pass by their way
[54:31] today.
[54:33] Lord, I pray for brother Jeff that you
[54:36] would touch him. Minister, Father, in a
[54:39] special way this day. Bless every father
[54:41] that's here.
[54:43] Lord, we thank you for being our
[54:45] heavenly father. We thank you for the
[54:48] goodness and the kindness giving your
[54:51] life for us. Minister to us this day.
[54:54] anoint as we speak to them in Jesus
[54:58] Christ's name we pray. Amen and amen.
[55:01] Amen. Amen. God bless you. God bless
[55:05] you. Amen. Brother Matt sung a song last
[55:08] night and and the and the song was in
[55:12] moments like these.
[55:14] And and that's what my title was this
[55:16] morning. I thought, man, what a way to
[55:19] end a service knowing tomorrow. Of
[55:21] course, he didn't know that. But I want
[55:23] to speak to you in these moments today
[55:28] and I want to use a verse. It's one
[55:30] verse. Numbers chapter 23 and verse 24.
[55:38] It's an important scripture for right
[55:40] now. It is the scripture that Benjamin
[55:44] Netanyahu
[55:46] used for the battle that they are in.
[55:52] And they read it to the whole nation.
[55:59] Numbers chapter 23 and verse 24.
[56:04] Behold, the people shall rise up as a
[56:07] great lion,
[56:09] and lift up himself as a young lion, and
[56:13] he shall not lie down until he eat of
[56:16] the prey, and drink
[56:19] the blood of the slain. Amen. You may be
[56:23] seated.
[56:28] In Amos chapter 3 and verse 8,
[56:31] and this was brother Harold
[56:33] Hildebrandt's favorite scripture, the
[56:36] lion hath roared,
[56:39] and who will not fear? The Lord God hath
[56:43] spoken, and who can but prophesy?
[56:48] Revelations chapter 5 and verse 5. And
[56:51] one of the elders saith unto me, weep
[56:54] not. Behold, the lion
[56:58] of the tribe of Judah, the root of
[57:01] David, hath prevailed to open the book,
[57:05] and to loose the seals thereof.
[57:09] That scripture has been fulfilled in
[57:11] this day. And today, you're you're the
[57:16] people of an open book.
[57:20] The scripture is not closed to you
[57:22] anymore, right? It's an open book to us.
[57:26] Now in our understanding of that, we
[57:29] understand very quickly that they have
[57:32] built colleges and the theological
[57:36] seminaries for for centuries
[57:41] and they built them trying to figure out
[57:43] the book. Right. That's right. What does
[57:46] it mean? How does it parallel?
[57:50] When is the rapture going to happen?
[57:53] What does this layout say of me?
[57:58] Isn't that true?
[58:01] Isn't that true? Many of you sit in
[58:03] different movements or denominations
[58:07] and they just probed at the book
[58:11] without an understanding of it.
[58:14] You know, if you're without
[58:15] understanding, you're just probing or
[58:17] you're given a good thought or an
[58:20] intellectual speech or something that
[58:23] will touch the second realm of your
[58:25] life. And and that's what the
[58:27] charismatic move. They they go to that
[58:30] second realm, that feelgood gospel.
[58:35] Are you with me? Everybody can feel good
[58:37] in a 25minut sermon. That's right.
[58:42] Are you with me? Are you with me? You
[58:45] took more time than that to get ready
[58:46] and go to church.
[58:49] And so, you know, you could tell by that
[58:51] statement, you're going to be here
[58:52] longer than 25 minutes.
[58:58] So, we needed a prophet.
[59:02] Let's just set it exactly where it is.
[59:04] We couldn't have a rapture without a
[59:07] prophet. That's right.
[59:09] We needed Malachi 45 and 6 to to come to
[59:14] life.
[59:16] And the reason you're sitting here is
[59:19] that you are also in those scriptures.
[59:22] Behold, I send you That's right. Elijah
[59:26] the prophet.
[59:28] And we come under a new administration
[59:31] because we're not catching the
[59:33] personality of William Brandham. That's
[59:35] right. Come on. That's not what we're
[59:37] after. We're not falling in love with
[59:39] the man or worshiping the man. He was
[59:42] the representative of Jesus Christ to
[59:46] this generation. That's right. And sure,
[59:49] it was evangelistical. And sure, there
[59:51] was in the first pull and the second
[59:53] pull was to grasp the people. But the
[59:56] third pull is where the denomination
[59:58] said, "He's off. He's went off.
[1:00:01] He's went off." But I want you to
[1:00:04] understand, that's where he caught the
[1:00:06] brideg.
[1:00:08] That's right. Probably the nomination
[1:00:11] system had more more miracles and more
[1:00:14] healings and right they had phenomenal
[1:00:18] things take place. Had tremendous
[1:00:20] speakers, but they couldn't open the
[1:00:23] book. That's right. You can't get
[1:00:26] rapture ready unless the book is open.
[1:00:32] Are you with me? Thousands of preachers
[1:00:34] will go this morning and and go, "What
[1:00:36] is this all about in Iraq and Iran and
[1:00:40] what's going on with Israel?" I'll tell
[1:00:42] you, they're getting ready.
[1:00:46] They're getting ready. The tribulation
[1:00:48] period is right here. But there's a
[1:00:50] bride that's got to go home.
[1:01:01] And so when we realize that you've got
[1:01:04] most of your denominations preaching
[1:01:08] preerttrib or post-trib, they don't know
[1:01:11] when it's coming, right? They figure
[1:01:14] it's going to be seven years of
[1:01:16] tribulation and we're going to go
[1:01:18] through that and we've got to survive
[1:01:20] that. But God sent you a prophet. That's
[1:01:22] right.
[1:01:24] that told you that he would not send his
[1:01:26] bride through that.
[1:01:32] Listen, that's that alone is enough to
[1:01:35] dance.
[1:01:44] There's been moments in the scriptures
[1:01:46] that were pivotal moments.
[1:01:50] Paul on his road to Damascus
[1:01:54] is a man that has a a zeal.
[1:01:58] He is sitting within the council. He's
[1:02:00] sitting at the feet of Gale. He has
[1:02:03] trained He's trained to be to be a man
[1:02:07] that is to get rid of these
[1:02:09] insurrectionist
[1:02:11] Jesus people.
[1:02:14] Because the book is closed to it. Right.
[1:02:17] Amen. I I want to pull this together.
[1:02:19] The book is closed. He can't understand
[1:02:22] who Jesus was. That's right. Who John
[1:02:24] the Baptist was. He can't understand the
[1:02:28] the word as it would be open for him.
[1:02:33] And so here he is and he's held the coat
[1:02:36] for Stephen.
[1:02:38] Caused many to their death and
[1:02:39] separating families. He thinks he's
[1:02:42] doing the right thing. Amen.
[1:02:48] But in a moment,
[1:02:51] a moment can change your life.
[1:02:54] A moment can change your life. In a
[1:02:57] moment, a pillar of fire takes him off
[1:03:01] of his horse.
[1:03:03] And he begins to realize this is a
[1:03:06] supernatural moment. That's right. Now,
[1:03:09] it's what you do in the moment, how you
[1:03:12] react in the moment. Preach. And he
[1:03:14] begins to speak to this. Amen. Who art
[1:03:18] thou Lord? And he says, I am Jesus.
[1:03:23] Now, he can identify the pillar of fire
[1:03:25] cuz he's wellstudied.
[1:03:28] But he cannot identify Jesus is the
[1:03:31] pillar of fire.
[1:03:37] Now,
[1:03:40] if you were close
[1:03:44] to this taking place,
[1:03:48] Paul was the only one that caught it.
[1:03:52] And I'm saying this for you. Paul is the
[1:03:55] only one that caught it. What about the
[1:03:58] men that were with him? That's right.
[1:04:02] What about the men that were in alliance
[1:04:06] with Paul
[1:04:08] that didn't get it?
[1:04:10] What does that have to do? How about the
[1:04:13] people that are with you?
[1:04:16] I'm talking about the dayto-day people
[1:04:18] that are with you.
[1:04:23] You was in the moment. It changed your
[1:04:26] life.
[1:04:29] It was important enough to you that it
[1:04:32] changed you forever.
[1:04:34] Forever.
[1:04:36] [Applause]
[1:04:39] Brother Charles, as you stand there, go
[1:04:41] ahead and stand there. Brother, is it
[1:04:43] Amos or Charles?
[1:04:46] Well, buddy,
[1:04:49] stand back up. I'll get all your names
[1:04:51] straight in 10 years.
[1:04:54] I'm not going to have that much time.
[1:04:56] Well, listen. You wasn't looking for
[1:04:59] this.
[1:05:02] You wasn't looking for this. But somehow
[1:05:05] in a moment,
[1:05:10] and here's a man that's now in charge
[1:05:12] and responsible for 15 children.
[1:05:17] You think God's doing small business
[1:05:19] here?
[1:05:21] Let's Let's just think about it for a
[1:05:23] moment. God's getting his last seat.
[1:05:36] Could
[1:05:40] you stand just a moment? No, no, no.
[1:05:43] Right behind you. Yeah. Sisters,
[1:05:48] here's a lady that had a dream.
[1:05:51] She related to Sister Connie yesterday
[1:05:54] or day before.
[1:05:56] Dreamed that these guys would be here.
[1:06:02] I'm not going to tell you the whole
[1:06:03] dream. When Connie read that to me
[1:06:06] yesterday, I said, "Connie, that's a
[1:06:08] supernatural dream."
[1:06:13] She said, "As I look and see these Amish
[1:06:17] people here,
[1:06:18] they were in the dream
[1:06:21] identified with the real bride
[1:06:24] believers."
[1:06:26] And she says, "I'm watching it happen.
[1:06:39] Won't you all stand? All of the Amish,
[1:06:41] please stand.
[1:07:05] Thank you.
[1:07:07] Thank you. Amen. You can take your
[1:07:10] seats,
[1:07:12] sister Kirsten. Doesn't that do your
[1:07:13] world your heart a world of good?
[1:07:25] We're in a moment.
[1:07:29] We're in a moment,
[1:07:32] brother Stephen. We were in a moment the
[1:07:34] other day.
[1:07:36] A moment.
[1:07:39] Now, these are just more than just
[1:07:41] moments, but these are life-changing
[1:07:43] moments.
[1:07:45] Now, now, now just think about it. Even
[1:07:49] the believers sometimes can understand
[1:07:53] what's going on.
[1:07:57] Even they will sit in skepticism.
[1:08:00] Right. Come on.
[1:08:03] When God directly,
[1:08:06] brother Timothy speaks to Ananas
[1:08:11] and says go
[1:08:13] and speak with Paul. That's right. Even
[1:08:17] he questions God. That's right. This is
[1:08:20] the man that has put our believers to
[1:08:24] death.
[1:08:27] He basically says, "God, you you know
[1:08:29] what you're doing.
[1:08:33] Is this a Trojan horse?" Let me just add
[1:08:35] some words. Is this a Trojan horse? Are
[1:08:38] we allowing our enemy to infiltrate us?
[1:08:42] That's right. That's right. I Let me
[1:08:45] just say this to you, but when you met
[1:08:48] Paul, he wasn't the same Paul.
[1:08:52] That's right. Listen, if you ever meet
[1:08:55] God,
[1:08:57] and I'm talking about truly having a
[1:08:59] personal experience with God,
[1:09:03] you're never the same.
[1:09:05] [Applause]
[1:09:17] It's like today there's a lot of people
[1:09:19] that are male
[1:09:23] and can produce seed.
[1:09:25] But there's a na major difference
[1:09:27] between being a male and being a father.
[1:09:35] I don't think I have to say too much
[1:09:37] there. There's a major difference
[1:09:39] between being a male
[1:09:42] that can produce seed
[1:09:46] than being a father.
[1:09:52] John would bring the church under a new
[1:09:55] administration.
[1:09:58] And under this Holy Ghost
[1:10:00] administration,
[1:10:02] God would take them from the book of
[1:10:04] Acts and take them all the way through
[1:10:07] the New Testament.
[1:10:09] He would train them how to dress. He
[1:10:12] train them how to marry. He would train
[1:10:14] them how to act in church.
[1:10:17] He would train them throughout the
[1:10:20] scriptures and begin to tell them about
[1:10:22] the deity of Jesus Christ,
[1:10:26] the citizenship of the kingdom of God.
[1:10:29] And I I know I'm only tipping the
[1:10:32] iceberg here because we're talking about
[1:10:34] 14 books of the Bible and explain how
[1:10:37] that God who filled our time, space, and
[1:10:40] eternity came down through the prophets.
[1:10:44] That's right. Amen. to which even in the
[1:10:46] Old Testament, many of them wasn't even
[1:10:48] recognized in their day.
[1:10:52] Everybody can look back and see a
[1:10:55] prophet.
[1:10:57] But to see him in your day,
[1:11:02] are you with me now, Brother Ron? I
[1:11:04] don't know what you're talking about.
[1:11:06] William Brandham spoke just about a mile
[1:11:09] away. Amen. I preach funerals there. But
[1:11:13] listen, they didn't catch it.
[1:11:18] They didn't catch it. But your father,
[1:11:20] your grandfather,
[1:11:23] went to that meeting and something was
[1:11:26] planted,
[1:11:29] something was planted
[1:11:32] inside of that that seed was there
[1:11:35] before the foundation of the world.
[1:11:38] They didn't catch it.
[1:11:44] There's still seed here.
[1:11:51] John would say it in the book of
[1:11:52] Revelation chapter 1.
[1:11:56] Now he's in the aisle of Patmas,
[1:11:59] one of the worst prisons that you could
[1:12:01] be in in that day.
[1:12:03] But remember, Brother Brown talks about
[1:12:05] two worlds at the same time.
[1:12:08] two worlds at the same time. He said,
[1:12:10] "Now I'm standing in two worlds."
[1:12:16] And I think that's sometimes what
[1:12:17] happens here. We stand in two worlds. We
[1:12:21] come out of our Walmart world or our
[1:12:24] work world and we come in here and God
[1:12:28] just elevates us.
[1:12:32] People have told us there's just
[1:12:33] something different in this place. That
[1:12:35] something different is him.
[1:12:41] No doubt there was incredibly hardened
[1:12:43] prisoners
[1:12:45] right there that that he was bumping
[1:12:48] shoulders with. And here John was
[1:12:52] getting the the climax book of the
[1:12:56] Bible. Right? Are you with me? Right.
[1:12:59] Just read that first first chapter. And
[1:13:03] he says, "And I fell at his feet as
[1:13:06] dead."
[1:13:09] What an atmosphere
[1:13:11] that he had came into.
[1:13:15] And from that atmosphere, now he begins
[1:13:18] to write to the church ages.
[1:13:21] And he begins to write the seals. And
[1:13:24] some of it's going to be open and some
[1:13:27] of it's going to be closed.
[1:13:31] Are you catching where I'm going now?
[1:13:33] Amen. So here we come with a prophet and
[1:13:36] he begins to speak these kind of
[1:13:38] sermons. God hid and revealed in
[1:13:42] simplicity
[1:13:45] and then he begins to preach sermons
[1:13:47] like this recognizing your day and its
[1:13:52] message. In that sermon he will begin to
[1:13:55] talk about they write papers and they
[1:13:57] write magazines. Fast and pray fast and
[1:14:01] pray. fast and prayed looking for that
[1:14:03] that great revival. And he said they're
[1:14:06] missing the vi the visitation. Amen. It
[1:14:11] was already among them.
[1:14:15] It was already on display and they were
[1:14:19] missing it.
[1:14:23] I want to bring it up a little bit
[1:14:25] further.
[1:14:27] The last revival is among the world.
[1:14:32] And many are still looking for it and
[1:14:35] missing it.
[1:14:45] Revelations chapter 10,
[1:14:48] the mighty angel comes down.
[1:14:52] I want you to understand, brother
[1:14:53] Brandham had read a lot of books.
[1:14:58] Even with his education, he had read an
[1:15:00] incredible amount of books. You can read
[1:15:02] it through the message. This book he
[1:15:03] read, this book he read, this book he
[1:15:05] read. He was quite a reader.
[1:15:08] And so,
[1:15:10] you know, just read hissups to Babylons,
[1:15:12] you can you can understand that he was
[1:15:14] quite a reader. And so,
[1:15:18] and so by intellect, brother Brandham
[1:15:21] could have never opened the book. Right.
[1:15:23] That's right.
[1:15:26] He could have never opened the book.
[1:15:30] But it makes a great big difference. And
[1:15:32] I'm sorry if I'm taking time here, but
[1:15:34] it makes a great big difference when the
[1:15:37] writer of the book
[1:15:43] is with you.
[1:15:45] And open it to you.
[1:15:52] Can you can you put up Acts 2:38?
[1:15:56] I want to just do something real simple
[1:15:57] here.
[1:16:00] Now listen,
[1:16:03] you don't need a revelation for this
[1:16:05] scripture.
[1:16:07] All you have to do How many people can
[1:16:09] read? Amen. Yeah, that's really good.
[1:16:12] You can do that.
[1:16:19] I want you to read this with me. And
[1:16:21] then Peter said unto them, repent and be
[1:16:25] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:16:29] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:16:32] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:16:35] Holy Ghost.
[1:16:40] You can read it
[1:16:42] you and your eyes are open. You go,
[1:16:46] "Well, that's just the truth.
[1:16:50] That's just the truth. Try to explain
[1:16:53] that to a trinitarian.
[1:16:59] Try to explain that to a trinitarian
[1:17:02] that believes in and they really don't
[1:17:04] really know what they believe.
[1:17:07] Try to explain that to them. You got to
[1:17:09] be baptized. You got to be rebaptized in
[1:17:11] that name. That's right. To be his wife.
[1:17:14] You got to take on his name
[1:17:17] because the book is closed.
[1:17:21] It's closed. And they'll go back to
[1:17:23] their teachings of hundreds of years ago
[1:17:26] and go back to the nice sin council of
[1:17:28] 3:25 when they closed the book.
[1:17:33] Men with their traditions closed the
[1:17:36] book.
[1:17:38] But a prophet came
[1:17:41] and made it real clear. Amen. To be his
[1:17:46] wife, you got to take on his name.
[1:17:51] I don't know how to make it any more
[1:17:53] simple than that.
[1:17:56] I just don't know how to make it.
[1:17:59] Let's Let's go to another junction
[1:18:02] in Luke 1 and verse 37.
[1:18:06] And there's a girl
[1:18:16] Now, you know, some people say, "Well,
[1:18:18] that's just you."
[1:18:20] That's just a testimony of one person.
[1:18:22] So, I want to give you the testimony of
[1:18:24] one person and how important the
[1:18:27] testimony of this one person is.
[1:18:31] Why are you doing that? Well, I don't
[1:18:33] know. Some of you have to answer the
[1:18:35] question. Do you mean to tell me that
[1:18:37] you really believe the story that an
[1:18:39] angel met brother Brandham in a cave?
[1:18:44] I I sure do. I I sure do. Because I'll
[1:18:49] tell you,
[1:18:51] if you look at his whole ministry, the
[1:18:53] angel was with him.
[1:18:57] And let's just go a little bit further.
[1:18:58] He's with us.
[1:19:01] Now, we don't want to repeat brother
[1:19:03] Brandham. None of us preachers are are
[1:19:05] brother Brandham or or gifted like
[1:19:07] brother Brham.
[1:19:09] Are you with me now? But we believe that
[1:19:13] an angel met him in the cave.
[1:19:18] All right, let's do this. She's a
[1:19:20] teenage girl and now he's gave her the
[1:19:23] salutation of what's going to happen.
[1:19:25] It's read every Christmas. And she
[1:19:28] responds
[1:19:30] and then and then the angel responds to
[1:19:33] her, for with God
[1:19:37] nothing shall be impossible.
[1:19:44] And Mary said, "Now the response must
[1:19:47] come." Paul had to respond. Peter had to
[1:19:50] respond. You have to respond.
[1:19:54] That's right. Come on, buddy. One thing
[1:19:55] for it to be preached to you, but now
[1:19:57] you got to respond. That's why your
[1:20:00] amens are important. And Mary said,
[1:20:03] "Behold, the handmade of the Lord bid it
[1:20:06] unto me
[1:20:08] according to thy word."
[1:20:11] And the angel departed from her. Now the
[1:20:14] testimony begins.
[1:20:19] Now notice what happens.
[1:20:22] She goes to her cousin and her husband,
[1:20:25] her cousin is carrying a dead body, a
[1:20:28] dead baby. And so this dead baby's in
[1:20:31] her womb and there's been no movement.
[1:20:33] And she tells the testimony of meeting
[1:20:37] an angel. And when she says his name,
[1:20:41] Jesus,
[1:20:43] that baby comes to life.
[1:20:49] Are you with me? Listen. When you give
[1:20:52] your testimony, whether they believe it
[1:20:54] or not, that doesn't matter.
[1:20:57] Your testimony is life.
[1:21:01] It's life.
[1:21:03] And it may not do them any good, but you
[1:21:07] feel the response
[1:21:11] of the life that is on the inside of
[1:21:13] you. You're different.
[1:21:21] So when we come to this, do you truly re
[1:21:25] realize, and I'm talking about truly
[1:21:28] realize, we're not just another church.
[1:21:34] We're not just another church.
[1:21:37] We're not just here to fill pews, build
[1:21:40] a building. We're not just here to build
[1:21:42] a ministry. We are the final voice.
[1:21:45] Amen.
[1:21:48] To the final age.
[1:21:52] Jesus said, "Let your light so shine
[1:21:55] before men that they may see your good
[1:21:59] works."
[1:22:02] So, you're in the darkest of age, but
[1:22:06] God predestinated you.
[1:22:09] That's right. Come on. Listen, those
[1:22:11] guys are not coming back to live. God's
[1:22:13] counting on you.
[1:22:16] Come on. That's right. Every generation
[1:22:20] has got to have a personal experience
[1:22:22] and a revival for themsel.
[1:22:25] It's good for William and Gabrielle to
[1:22:27] have it, but these children
[1:22:30] has to have their own personal
[1:22:33] experience.
[1:22:37] That's right.
[1:22:38] You've got the cloud pin pinned on your
[1:22:40] jacket, but the one that's more than
[1:22:44] that pin
[1:22:46] wants to live in your life.
[1:22:50] That's right.
[1:22:54] Brother Chris, you've got the table
[1:22:56] where the squirrels were eat on.
[1:23:00] But the one that created squirrels,
[1:23:06] boy, this is so awesome.
[1:23:09] So awesome. Wants more than a table.
[1:23:16] I want you to think how much different
[1:23:18] we are than Catholics.
[1:23:22] We were Catholics, we'd have that table
[1:23:24] here enshrined in a glass case.
[1:23:29] Come on.
[1:23:31] Are you with me? They pick out a rock
[1:23:34] and enshrine it.
[1:23:37] They pick out a place where some great
[1:23:40] saint was
[1:23:42] and enshrine it. God wants your life.
[1:23:48] He wants your life. He wants your heart.
[1:23:51] He wants to live inside of you. Yes,
[1:23:55] that's right. Lord,
[1:23:58] you know, when I first Let me just give
[1:24:00] you personal thoughts here. When I first
[1:24:03] I was raised in this message, did that
[1:24:05] make it easy for me? No. It made it
[1:24:09] harder for you, you know, cuz I was
[1:24:11] raised in it. Sat on a bench. I I was
[1:24:13] there. How many times somebody drugged
[1:24:15] me to the altar? I didn't get nothing. I
[1:24:17] just tried to please them. I walked to
[1:24:19] the altar.
[1:24:21] Listen,
[1:24:22] I could quote with the tape recorder. My
[1:24:26] brother could quote with it what brother
[1:24:28] Brandham was going to say.
[1:24:31] That didn't give me life.
[1:24:34] I knew how to dress. That didn't give me
[1:24:36] life. I knew how to conduct myself. That
[1:24:40] didn't give me life. But when I met the
[1:24:43] author,
[1:24:47] come on. When I had my personal moment,
[1:24:52] my moment,
[1:24:58] brother Ron, I said in this pew that I
[1:25:00] need more. You need more than that. I'm
[1:25:03] glad you're here, but you need more than
[1:25:05] that. I want to challenge you. Shake
[1:25:08] yourself.
[1:25:09] [Applause]
[1:25:24] When you get a call,
[1:25:26] hey, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
[1:25:30] I don't know. What are you seeing,
[1:25:34] Homer?
[1:25:39] Homer just walked in our room.
[1:25:47] Garland just arrived.
[1:25:50] Your loved ones, Sister Pat, how happy
[1:25:54] you'll be.
[1:25:57] But you're on the other line and you go,
[1:26:01] I am not experiencing anything like
[1:26:03] that.
[1:26:05] It's too late.
[1:26:10] I've actually had people tell me when
[1:26:12] Los Angeles drops beneath the ocean,
[1:26:14] I'll get sincere.
[1:26:19] Listen, when the ark door closed, it was
[1:26:21] too late.
[1:26:24] Listen, while there's still mercy,
[1:26:29] Brother Ron, but you guys are constantly
[1:26:30] after us. I'm after your soul.
[1:26:36] Listen, we'll walk down streets of gold
[1:26:39] and we'll rejoice and we'll be young,
[1:26:43] but to get there,
[1:26:45] we got to do the right thing here.
[1:26:58] I don't care what kind of excuse you
[1:27:01] got. There's nothing here in this world
[1:27:05] we're staying for.
[1:27:07] [Applause]
[1:27:10] Nothing. Look at your neighbor. Say,
[1:27:12] "Nothing here."
[1:27:31] Two years ago, maybe three years ago,
[1:27:35] I spoke a sermon called Anointed
[1:27:39] for Rapture.
[1:27:41] Is that two or three years ago?
[1:27:45] Is everything okay?
[1:27:48] I when these boys get to laughing, I go.
[1:27:54] Brother Vernon, I'll just be honest with
[1:27:56] you. Sometimes when they go to laughing,
[1:27:57] I think, is my pants zipped.
[1:28:18] I'm back on track now.
[1:28:20] Listen, we're human beings here. We're
[1:28:22] not gods for you to worship. We're human
[1:28:24] beings.
[1:28:29] Definitely don't worship me. Connie will
[1:28:31] give you the reasons why not to
[1:28:34] pray for her. She's not feeling well
[1:28:36] today.
[1:28:38] I spoke a sermon and feeling directly
[1:28:43] to speak to speak on anointed for
[1:28:47] rapture
[1:28:49] and showing the difference through all
[1:28:50] the ages they were anointed for
[1:28:52] different purposes.
[1:28:54] But this age, climax of this age, the
[1:28:58] climax of this message is not to create
[1:29:02] another denomination.
[1:29:04] But but the the completion of this
[1:29:08] message is a body change.
[1:29:13] And so I spoke that sermon anointed for
[1:29:15] rapture. And when I stepped back in the
[1:29:18] back, it had been 12 years since I had
[1:29:21] killed a rack buck.
[1:29:24] And so
[1:29:26] and so anyway, it may be a little bit
[1:29:28] longer, 3 years. So anyway,
[1:29:32] I was sitting in the back and
[1:29:35] and I said, "Boys, tomorrow
[1:29:40] I'm going to kill a buck and it's it's
[1:29:42] going to be about this wide
[1:29:44] and it's going to be about this tall."
[1:29:50] And I I said, "Tomorrow I'm going to do
[1:29:53] this." Well, that was unusual for me to
[1:29:55] do that, for me to say anything like
[1:29:57] that, cuz I'd have been saying that all
[1:30:00] along.
[1:30:04] I went this big.
[1:30:08] And so
[1:30:10] we went hunting the next day.
[1:30:12] And so Andrew calls me about four
[1:30:15] o'clock and he said, "Have you seen
[1:30:17] anything today?" And I said, "No, I
[1:30:20] haven't seen anything today." I said, "I
[1:30:22] I've just been sitting up here. It's
[1:30:23] been a good day. Had a wonderful day.
[1:30:25] I've just been sitting here watching
[1:30:27] squirrels."
[1:30:29] And he makes this statement. He said,
[1:30:31] "Get ready, Dad." And he says, "Get
[1:30:34] ready, Dad." And I'm hunting a long way
[1:30:36] away from him. And he says, "Get ready,
[1:30:38] Dad." hung up the phone and here comes
[1:30:42] this buck.
[1:30:45] You can't make these things up. Oh,
[1:30:48] brother, that's just a story. Really?
[1:30:53] And he steps out and he comes walking
[1:30:55] across
[1:30:57] and I shoot him.
[1:31:01] For all those animal lovers, I'm sorry.
[1:31:04] And I shoot him and he takes a couple
[1:31:06] steps down and he stumbles.
[1:31:09] I just had got cancer. So it was Yeah.
[1:31:12] 2020. And so and so anyway, he stumbles
[1:31:16] down over the heel. Well, they tell me
[1:31:18] they quickly I I call Andrew and I said,
[1:31:20] "I got him." He said, "I just asked
[1:31:24] you." He said, "Have you seen anything?"
[1:31:26] And you've already got him.
[1:31:29] And I said, "You told me be ready.
[1:31:32] [Applause]
[1:31:36] Why are you dropping this in the
[1:31:37] sermon?" I have told you
[1:31:42] be ready.
[1:31:46] Be ready.
[1:32:00] I was in a phase that I shouldn't went
[1:32:02] down over that mountain, but I did. And
[1:32:05] then I climbed back up. I don't know why
[1:32:07] I climbed back up, but I climbed back up
[1:32:10] and then I went back down and then I
[1:32:12] climbed back up.
[1:32:15] Now, when the boys got there, they h
[1:32:17] they hooked a rope to me and pulled me
[1:32:19] back out of there.
[1:32:28] Brother Gabriel had a plaque put up
[1:32:32] over top of that deer anointed for
[1:32:34] rapture
[1:32:36] because we felt it was important spot
[1:32:40] as a bride. We have been had we have had
[1:32:44] important spots.
[1:32:48] And you know what they would do in
[1:32:50] important spots in the in uh in the
[1:32:54] scriptures? They would create an altar.
[1:32:58] Amen. They'd create an altar because we
[1:33:01] met God. In your home, we talk about
[1:33:05] Father's Day. In your home, your home
[1:33:08] should be a place to where God visits.
[1:33:15] Are you with me? More than just at
[1:33:17] church,
[1:33:19] in your home.
[1:33:22] You should book in your day with prayer.
[1:33:25] and reading your Bible. That's right.
[1:33:28] Morning and night. Are you with me now?
[1:33:31] Amen.
[1:33:32] So the bride around the world and and we
[1:33:36] have visitors come here. You guys are
[1:33:38] here. John and the and the roof saying,
[1:33:42] "Did you bringing knives?" And so and so
[1:33:45] anyway, personal. It's personal.
[1:33:49] And so anyway, we have visitors come
[1:33:52] here from all over the world. In a
[1:33:55] couple of weeks, we got visitors coming
[1:33:56] here from Germany and from Poland, same
[1:33:59] weekend.
[1:34:01] You will find they have the same spirit.
[1:34:09] They have the same spirit. Now, their
[1:34:12] culture may be a little bit different,
[1:34:15] but it's the same spirit of Christ.
[1:34:19] Are you with me? the same spirit of
[1:34:21] Christ that is not only here in this
[1:34:24] community but it's in their church
[1:34:30] whether it's 10 people or a thousand
[1:34:33] people
[1:34:35] now I'm not talking about people that
[1:34:37] just go to church I'm talking about real
[1:34:40] believers
[1:34:45] you remember you just moments ago I used
[1:34:47] there's a difference between a a a male
[1:34:51] and a father.
[1:34:53] I want to say there's a real difference
[1:34:57] between a church member That's right.
[1:35:01] and the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:35:11] Can I just preach a little bit longer?
[1:35:13] Come on, brother said, could you imagine
[1:35:16] a little mouse
[1:35:18] uh that that had been there in the
[1:35:21] garners of Egypt
[1:35:23] saying, "I just better eat two grains a
[1:35:26] day cuz I might run out."
[1:35:33] You say, "Well, that's nonsense."
[1:35:36] They had 10,000 rats that size, they'd
[1:35:40] never run out.
[1:35:43] If it was a fish, I better just be real,
[1:35:47] real careful. I better not drink too
[1:35:50] much water or I'll run out out here in
[1:35:53] the ocean.
[1:35:55] Amen.
[1:35:56] And I want to just take that just a
[1:35:58] moment and say, listen, don't let this
[1:36:02] message become common to you.
[1:36:07] Oh, I've read that before. Read it
[1:36:09] again.
[1:36:10] I've heard that before. Listen again
[1:36:15] in the same quote
[1:36:18] that you're common with. You'll find
[1:36:20] something different
[1:36:23] that will enlighten you today. I didn't
[1:36:25] catch that before.
[1:36:29] How you know that, brother Ron?
[1:36:32] every speaker that we have.
[1:36:36] Okay, this is my pull pit that God gave
[1:36:39] me to preach. But I'm not jealous. Amen.
[1:36:43] I want the best of the best to preach
[1:36:46] behind this pull pit. I want these guys
[1:36:49] to speak their hearts behind this pull
[1:36:52] pit. And we'll invite somebody to come
[1:36:54] in and preach and and they'll come and
[1:36:56] preach. And and you know throughout the
[1:36:58] spring there was a theme that almost
[1:37:00] happened. Forgiveness and mercy that was
[1:37:03] almost a theme throughout the and you
[1:37:06] know I was preaching the same thing
[1:37:09] that those people was preaching the week
[1:37:12] before and I had preached it you know
[1:37:14] throughout my ministry
[1:37:16] and some of you would walk up say I
[1:37:18] never saw it like that before. Amen.
[1:37:24] It's kind of like mashed potatoes.
[1:37:31] And all of a sudden you go, "That's the
[1:37:34] best that you ever fixed."
[1:37:38] And you go, "I preached them like that
[1:37:41] for 20 years.
[1:37:50] I spoke the breach since I was a kid
[1:37:55] and you're just now getting to it.
[1:38:01] I've talked about mercy. Brother William
[1:38:03] told me something that thrilled my heart
[1:38:06] and and I used it with him this morning.
[1:38:07] Said, "Okay, say it." And I told Brother
[1:38:10] William, Brother William told me
[1:38:12] something. He said after about a year or
[1:38:13] two here, he said, "Brother Ron, I came
[1:38:16] here and I had to come here to figure
[1:38:19] out grace."
[1:38:23] Hey, it was laying in the message all
[1:38:24] that time.
[1:38:27] It was laying right there all the time.
[1:38:31] But the author of the book says, "Okay,
[1:38:34] you're ready for it.
[1:38:36] You're ready for it. Now, let me give it
[1:38:39] to you.
[1:38:48] I had a minister sitting at a table with
[1:38:51] me one time was an older guy. He's
[1:38:52] sitting at the table with me. He said,
[1:38:54] "Well, I get bored with the message."
[1:38:56] And I thought, "You don't know the same
[1:38:57] message I do."
[1:39:01] Don't never get bored with coming to
[1:39:02] church.
[1:39:05] Never get bored with this cuz he's here.
[1:39:08] Amen.
[1:39:10] When he's in the room, you guys sung it
[1:39:12] last night. When he's in the room, I
[1:39:15] just want to stay here.
[1:39:23] Moments. Moments.
[1:39:26] Brother Brandham has a prayer.
[1:39:31] I can't imagine being in this moment
[1:39:33] right here. Now, he's praying. Notice
[1:39:37] what he says.
[1:39:40] He said, he says, "I want you to repeat
[1:39:42] this prayer. You pray
[1:39:45] and I'll repeat it. You pray it and I'll
[1:39:50] just transfer the words
[1:39:52] that it takes to defeat Satan
[1:39:56] right to your lips." And then you
[1:39:59] believe your confession.
[1:40:01] And now you that's sick, repeat this
[1:40:04] with me.
[1:40:07] You do not know how many times
[1:40:11] I've read this quote to myself.
[1:40:15] Almighty God,
[1:40:17] creator of heavens and earth, author of
[1:40:20] everlasting life, giver of all good
[1:40:23] gifts. And you can just hear the
[1:40:25] audience. And your servant confess my
[1:40:28] sins. And I believe that through the
[1:40:31] merits of the son, thy son Jesus, I am
[1:40:35] forgiven of my sins. I am sick in my
[1:40:37] body. I need your help. Give me faith
[1:40:41] just now to believe your word and to
[1:40:43] believe these things which I have seen
[1:40:45] tonight that reproduces your life again.
[1:40:49] As it was yesterday and so it is today
[1:40:52] and now, Lord, upon this confession, I
[1:40:56] accept my healing.
[1:40:59] And I believe that this night, this
[1:41:02] night, henceforth,
[1:41:06] I shall be well.
[1:41:08] I commit myself to you in the name of
[1:41:12] Jesus Christ.
[1:41:20] Brother Ron, that was brother Brandham
[1:41:21] on a tape. That was a tape of recording.
[1:41:27] Okay.
[1:41:29] Okay. There was a brother in brother
[1:41:31] Bisco's church that couldn't keep a job.
[1:41:33] He couldn't he just couldn't keep a job.
[1:41:35] He was going from one job to another and
[1:41:37] he was starving to death. Been in the
[1:41:40] painting business.
[1:41:42] And he comes in all desperate and
[1:41:45] he's just I try I'm going to try to tell
[1:41:48] the story like it's told. Andrew, you
[1:41:50] can help me. But anyway, he comes in, he
[1:41:52] changes his shirt into a white shirt,
[1:41:56] and he sits down at a straight back
[1:41:58] chair and reaches over and turns the
[1:42:01] tape recorder on.
[1:42:03] And when he turns it on,
[1:42:06] Brother Brandham says, "You in that that
[1:42:09] chair with the white shirt on
[1:42:14] and prays for him specifically his
[1:42:17] need."
[1:42:20] Well, how do you know that worked?
[1:42:22] Listen, within days, he had the best job
[1:42:25] and I think he just retired from that.
[1:42:28] Best job he ever had in his life
[1:42:31] because it produced what it said it
[1:42:33] would do.
[1:42:35] Let me just tell you, if you're in the
[1:42:37] balance of does this message work,
[1:42:42] look how far you've come.
[1:42:46] Hallelujah.
[1:42:56] I don't know if you know this yet, but I
[1:42:58] told your story last week in Ohio. You
[1:43:00] heard me tell their story. You probably
[1:43:03] didn't know who I was talking about, but
[1:43:04] I told your story.
[1:43:09] And I told something in your story when
[1:43:11] I was talking about you
[1:43:13] uh a few weeks ago here and I talked
[1:43:16] about you in a fight.
[1:43:22] There was some things said there
[1:43:24] and uh
[1:43:26] maybe even three
[1:43:29] that he whipped. Well, he had he never
[1:43:32] told his father that that happened. And
[1:43:36] so now his father's a song leader and he
[1:43:39] walks up to me last night and he says,
[1:43:41] "Brother Ron," he said, "when you was
[1:43:42] telling that story,
[1:43:44] Shannon," he said, "Dylan said, I never
[1:43:48] told you that."
[1:43:51] Well, you see, the author of the book
[1:43:54] knew it. Amen.
[1:43:58] And wanted to remind you personally, I
[1:44:00] got you.
[1:44:04] I got you. So you're a young Christian
[1:44:06] and God just reminds you, "Hey, I got
[1:44:08] you."
[1:44:13] So in
[1:44:15] Friday night, I go out and I'm shaking
[1:44:18] some hands as I'm on my way to the
[1:44:20] truck. There was a man named Dallas.
[1:44:22] He's a grandfather. And the grandmother,
[1:44:25] they walk up to me and said, "My
[1:44:27] grandson's hopefully coming tomorrow
[1:44:29] night and he's probably going to watch
[1:44:30] this service because he watches them."
[1:44:33] And so I think he's 38, 39 years old.
[1:44:36] And he says, he said, he's not a
[1:44:38] Christian by any stretch of the
[1:44:41] imagination, but he really needs God.
[1:44:43] And he's been listening to your sermons.
[1:44:45] He really needs God. He's going to bring
[1:44:48] his girlfriend, and they're all tatted
[1:44:50] up. And I'm just praying that they will
[1:44:53] meet Christ
[1:44:55] while he's here on Saturday night.
[1:44:59] Well, I preached the service on Saturday
[1:45:01] night.
[1:45:03] And those kids are sitting right where
[1:45:05] you are sitting in the service. And so
[1:45:08] we have a prayer line. I preach and we
[1:45:11] have a prayer line. Listen, I can't do
[1:45:13] none of this.
[1:45:16] Let me let me just I can't do none of
[1:45:18] this.
[1:45:20] But we serve a mighty God.
[1:45:23] And so at the end of the prayer line,
[1:45:25] the Lord just speaks to me. Go speak to
[1:45:28] them.
[1:45:30] Well, we're taught by the prophet, don't
[1:45:32] go to them. They'll come to you.
[1:45:35] But the author is telling me, "Go speak
[1:45:38] to them." He's a big boy. His wife's got
[1:45:41] blue hair. But you don't have to worry
[1:45:44] about blue hair. That'll fix itself.
[1:45:50] Don't worry about tattoos. Listen to
[1:45:53] Brother Tim's service on Sunday. Just
[1:45:54] raise them tattooed hands up before the
[1:45:56] Lord and praise him.
[1:46:10] And so I pray with him, pray with both
[1:46:12] of them together.
[1:46:14] They're both crying and weeping. And he
[1:46:17] reaches down to me and he said, "Brother
[1:46:18] Ron, on the way to this meeting, I
[1:46:22] prayed. Let me see a sign. Let him come
[1:46:26] to me.
[1:46:33] moment.
[1:46:37] Moment.
[1:46:48] Can I tell one more story?
[1:46:51] Then we're going to have communion.
[1:46:56] I'd been burned
[1:46:58] and was in a fire. You know that.
[1:47:05] And
[1:47:07] Brother Biscllow would call Connie.
[1:47:10] Matthew was in one hospital. I was in
[1:47:12] the other. And brother Biscll would call
[1:47:15] her and say, "Sister Connie, where's
[1:47:19] where are you at now?" She said, "I'm in
[1:47:22] between hospitals. I went ran to see
[1:47:25] Matthew in the hospital and I'm on my
[1:47:27] way to see Ron
[1:47:30] and he said, "The Lord woke me up this
[1:47:32] morning
[1:47:34] talking to you about a moment. The Lord
[1:47:37] woke me up this morning." Had to be in
[1:47:40] the middle of the night
[1:47:42] and and instructed me to tell you,
[1:47:46] "Brother Ron will be the speaker at next
[1:47:50] year's camp."
[1:47:52] They had bought Bible way camp. Now the
[1:47:55] Lord, the author of this book is telling
[1:47:59] Ed Bisll
[1:48:01] that the speaker next year will be Ron
[1:48:05] Spencer.
[1:48:06] Now I I want to just catch you up for
[1:48:08] some of you who've never known this
[1:48:10] story. I was my lungs were burnt. I
[1:48:15] would fly in a I would fly in a flight
[1:48:18] to Philadelphia with the man that put me
[1:48:24] in a coma.
[1:48:27] And he said, "I'll tell you, Ron," these
[1:48:29] were his words. "I'll tell you, Ron, I
[1:48:32] never expected you to live."
[1:48:36] He said, "Your lungs were crisp."
[1:48:41] You would know something about that.
[1:48:43] They were burned. Lungs are like a sock.
[1:48:47] And they were crisp and they had nothing
[1:48:50] but soot in your lungs. No way for you
[1:48:54] to breathe on your own.
[1:48:56] He said, "I put you in that coma." He
[1:48:59] said, "I watched your story.
[1:49:02] I watched it all along." He said,
[1:49:04] "You're a miracle."
[1:49:08] On the day that they told Connie
[1:49:13] that I wouldn't live,
[1:49:16] God prepared her for that moment
[1:49:22] by calling her with a message preacher
[1:49:30] and telling her he'll be the speaker
[1:49:34] at next year's camp. Oh, that's just
[1:49:37] another story. Brother Ron,
[1:49:40] do you understand how impossible?
[1:49:46] You understand anything about medical
[1:49:48] science? How impossible it was for me to
[1:49:52] live,
[1:49:55] much less recover to the spot that I
[1:49:59] would become a preacher again. Right.
[1:50:03] Listen, I struggle for six months
[1:50:08] to walk up steps. I struggle for six
[1:50:11] months to catch enough air to preach
[1:50:13] right here.
[1:50:16] Preach camp meetings. Impossible.
[1:50:21] But the author said
[1:50:34] The author said,
[1:50:37] "Yesterday,
[1:50:39] Whitney for Father's Day
[1:50:42] gave me a picture
[1:50:46] of Isaac walking across the yard with
[1:50:50] his finger up in the air
[1:50:52] with the Disney shirt on.
[1:50:57] And that is the picture of the vision
[1:50:59] that I had three years before he was
[1:51:04] born.
[1:51:09] How, brother Ron? The author.
[1:51:12] I want to talk to you. The author that
[1:51:15] knows what's going on in your life. Why
[1:51:19] are you telling this? This is the moment
[1:51:21] for you to catch it.
[1:51:24] This is you're dealing with different
[1:51:26] things in your life in this moment. Go,
[1:51:29] be it unto me.
[1:51:33] Be it unto me according to thy word.
[1:51:37] Don't let me just be out in space
[1:51:39] somewhere another. But I want to catch
[1:51:41] this.
[1:51:43] I want to catch this.
[1:51:46] You got loved ones you want to see come
[1:51:47] home. Catch this.
[1:52:02] You're not from this country.
[1:52:05] I see you're from overseas.
[1:52:08] Jamaica. It is.
[1:52:10] Your name is Brady.
[1:52:13] Tom Brady.
[1:52:15] It's not for you. It's for your wife.
[1:52:20] That's right. We don't even have to hear
[1:52:22] the story. We can listen to the tape.
[1:52:27] Now listen, this message is more than
[1:52:28] about a caribou and a silver tip grizzly
[1:52:31] bear and squirrels. It's about you.
[1:52:35] God is producing a bride.
[1:52:41] Bone of his bone, life of his life
[1:52:45] with his life living inside of you. And
[1:52:49] there is a moment
[1:52:54] terra when it comes to life.
[1:52:58] And when that happens, you'll live the
[1:53:00] rest of your life because of that
[1:53:02] moment.
[1:53:06] I know this is simple today.
[1:53:09] It's what he laid on my heart,
[1:53:12] but this is what these young people
[1:53:14] need. Amen.
[1:53:18] As a matter of fact, some of you have
[1:53:19] amnesia and you forgot. This is more
[1:53:22] than how long the service is going to
[1:53:24] be.
[1:53:28] Sometimes we measure services by how
[1:53:30] long the preacher is. You've got the
[1:53:32] wrong idea here.
[1:53:34] Got the wrong idea.
[1:53:38] In every service, I look for the point.
[1:53:41] Say, God, you're speaking to me.
[1:53:47] And I want to catch it.
[1:53:51] I want to catch it.
[1:53:57] Could we stand to our feet?
[1:54:07] Amen.
[1:54:10] Amen.
[1:54:12] Amen.
[1:54:15] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:54:22] Hallelujah.
[1:54:29] The deacons will prepare for
[1:54:38] the Lord's supper.
[1:54:41] We want everybody that will take it
[1:54:43] today because we're a body of believers.
[1:54:47] Amen. Mother Ron, you don't want just so
[1:54:48] and so to take it. I want I want
[1:54:51] everybody.
[1:54:53] Listen, when it comes to going to
[1:54:54] heaven, I want everybody to go.
[1:54:57] I I don't have any odd against anybody.
[1:55:00] I want everybody to go. Well, brother,
[1:55:02] I've got things against you. Okay, get
[1:55:04] over it.
[1:55:07] Life's too important for that. Just move
[1:55:10] on. Move on. Move on. Amen.
[1:55:15] Amen.
[1:55:17] Andrew. Andrew, I'm going to ask you to
[1:55:21] I'm going ask you to read the text for
[1:55:23] me if you would.
[1:55:25] My My eyes are too blurry.
[1:55:37] Amen. Do that for me.
[1:55:41] Amen.
[1:55:43] Amen. It's
[1:55:47] 1 Corinthians 11
[1:55:54] verse 23. Amen. Thank you.
[1:55:58] I apologize for not being able to see.
[1:56:01] For I have received of the Lord that
[1:56:04] which also I delivered unto you, that
[1:56:06] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[1:56:08] he was betrayed, took bread, and when he
[1:56:11] had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[1:56:13] "Take, eat. This is my body which is
[1:56:16] broken for you. This do in remembrance
[1:56:18] of me." And after the same manner also,
[1:56:21] he took the cup. When he had sucked,
[1:56:24] saying, "This cup is the new testament
[1:56:26] in my blood. This do ye as oft as you
[1:56:30] drink it. in remembrance of me. For as
[1:56:33] often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:56:35] this cup, you do show the Lord's death
[1:56:38] till he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall
[1:56:42] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:56:44] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:56:47] body and the blood of the Lord. But let
[1:56:50] a man examine himself, and so let him
[1:56:53] eat
[1:56:56] of that bread and drink of that cup. For
[1:56:59] he that eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:57:01] unworthily
[1:57:03] eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to
[1:57:04] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[1:57:07] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:57:09] among you, and many sleep. For if we
[1:57:12] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[1:57:15] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[1:57:17] chasened of the Lord, that we should not
[1:57:19] be condemned with the world. Wherefore,
[1:57:22] my brethren, when you come together to
[1:57:23] eat, tarry one for another, and if any
[1:57:26] man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye
[1:57:28] may come not together unto condemnation,
[1:57:31] and the rest will I set in order when I
[1:57:34] come.
[1:57:35] Amen. Amen. Could we just bow our heads
[1:57:38] today and ask the Lord to just touch our
[1:57:41] lives? If there's anything that you need
[1:57:44] to ask the Lord to forgive you of,
[1:57:46] right, here's a spot. Just say, "Father,
[1:57:49] cleanse my heart. Cleanse my mind.
[1:57:51] Cleanse my thoughts. Andrew, would you
[1:57:54] pray for us?
[1:57:58] Dear Lord Jesus,
[1:58:00] Lord, we come before your presence,
[1:58:02] Lord, today. And Lord, we want to
[1:58:04] rightly discern your body, Lord Jesus.
[1:58:08] Lord, we want to examine oursel, Father,
[1:58:10] today here in the presence of Jehovah.
[1:58:13] We just ask, Lord, that your mercies
[1:58:15] that are new every day would be new to
[1:58:17] us. Lord, we come before you in this
[1:58:19] very sacred moment, Lord. And we desire,
[1:58:22] Lord Jesus, God, to be made more like
[1:58:26] you in this moment, Lord, as we get
[1:58:29] ready to partake of these elements,
[1:58:31] Father, we ask that you would forgive us
[1:58:33] of our sins. Forgive us of our mistakes,
[1:58:36] Lord Jesus. Lord, we do this as an
[1:58:39] ordinance under thy word, Father. Oh
[1:58:41] God, we ask, God, that you would just
[1:58:43] come. We realize that we are in a very
[1:58:46] sacred and special moment in time. And
[1:58:48] we just invite you, Lord, to our lives
[1:58:51] here to this church. Lord, give us a a
[1:58:54] deeper consecration, Father, a deeper
[1:58:57] sincerity, Lord, a a a commitment in our
[1:59:01] hearts, Lord, to serve you like never
[1:59:03] before. Lord, we give you this day in
[1:59:06] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. And won't you
[1:59:10] explain how this works? Amen. And you
[1:59:12] that are new with us, uh, if you
[1:59:14] wouldn't just, the brothers will really
[1:59:16] just make it real simple. The brothers
[1:59:18] will give you some instruction. Uh, the
[1:59:20] first row if you wouldn't just mind just
[1:59:22] stand still and the brothers will bring
[1:59:23] it to you directly and then uh, the
[1:59:25] deacons will give orders to everybody
[1:59:28] and then just hold your uh, communion,
[1:59:30] hold the bread and the wine till the
[1:59:32] very end and we'll all partake of it
[1:59:33] together um, as the brothers are
[1:59:36] prepared there.
[1:59:50] We are a moment.
[1:59:53] You are forever.
[1:59:56] Lord of the ages.
[1:59:59] God before time.
[2:00:02] We are a vapor.

[2:04:44] Oh, haunted by the years of past defeat.
[2:04:53] the way I see you standing near me,
[2:04:58] Lord,
[2:05:00] shining with compassion in your eyes.
[2:05:10] I pray this.
[2:05:13] I pray

[2:05:20] and let your love shine through me in
[2:05:24] the night.

[2:06:04] [Music]
[2:06:05] And you can take what's wrong. Make it

[2:16:27] [Music]
[2:16:40] He had his last supper with his
[2:16:41] disciples.
[2:16:45] One of these days we'll have our last
[2:16:47] supper here
[2:16:49] before we go to the marriage supper of
[2:16:51] the lamb.
[2:16:55] And for those that are new among us, let
[2:16:58] me just take a moment.
[2:17:00] What you have just received is
[2:17:01] unleavened bread.
[2:17:04] God wants a wife with no sin in her. And
[2:17:08] unleavened bread is a type of the body
[2:17:11] of Jesus Christ. We needed a lamb.
[2:17:16] Not just one of the prophets, but we
[2:17:18] needed a lamb that had no sin
[2:17:22] where Satan could not accuse him of
[2:17:25] anything.
[2:17:27] Even Even Pilate would say, "I find no
[2:17:31] fault
[2:17:33] inside of him.
[2:17:36] The wine that you have with you,
[2:17:40] it's not grape juice.
[2:17:43] We're not a denomination.
[2:17:46] Grape juice rots.
[2:17:49] It'll rot.
[2:17:51] Wine will get better with age.
[2:17:55] It is a type of the blood of the Lord
[2:17:58] Jesus Christ.
[2:18:00] And that that blood
[2:18:04] transforms our life. Take the blood out
[2:18:06] of any of us and we're going to die. And
[2:18:09] so wine will get better. It's like the
[2:18:12] Holy Ghost. It'll get better with age.
[2:18:15] It'll be a spiritual growth in your
[2:18:17] life. We do this together because we're
[2:18:20] a body of believers.
[2:18:22] We're Full Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle.
[2:18:26] We do this not on a certain day to where
[2:18:30] that we around the world do it. We do it
[2:18:33] as a portion of the bride of Jesus
[2:18:35] Christ. Not just these four walls, but
[2:18:39] we're a portion of all of the nations.
[2:18:43] We pray for the body of Jesus Christ.
[2:18:47] And by doing this, we perform the
[2:18:50] scriptures that he told us to do this
[2:18:53] until he comes. We we will not wash feet
[2:18:57] today, but there will come a time to
[2:18:58] where we wash feet one with another as a
[2:19:01] representation of what he does. So
[2:19:04] today, I want you to understand it's a
[2:19:06] pivotal important thing. If you're sick
[2:19:09] standing there,
[2:19:11] you can be healed while you take
[2:19:13] communion.
[2:19:15] You have needs in your body. Won't you
[2:19:17] just ask him to touch your body today?
[2:19:19] And maybe there's needs that you've got.
[2:19:22] He's here.
[2:19:24] He's here to meet our needs today. Let's
[2:19:27] just thank him for it. Lord, we thank
[2:19:29] you that we can stand here as a body of
[2:19:32] believers.
[2:19:33] I ask you, Father, that you would bless
[2:19:35] the elements. They're about we're about
[2:19:37] to receive now. We ask you to bless this
[2:19:40] audience and I bring them as their
[2:19:42] pastor before you. And I present them as
[2:19:45] trophies of Christ. I pray that you
[2:19:48] would touch their bodies. I have a need
[2:19:50] in my body, Lord. My wife does. Sister
[2:19:53] Terresa Derlandi needs it. Brother Bill.
[2:19:56] Lord, the many of us, Sister Teresa
[2:19:59] Gooden, Lord, Sister Wanda that has just
[2:20:01] went through operation, Lord, we need
[2:20:03] you to touch us. We need a healer in the
[2:20:06] house and you're here, Lord. And I just
[2:20:09] ask you today as we take this together,
[2:20:12] may you bless them in Jesus Christ's
[2:20:15] name. The unleavened bread, take and
[2:20:18] eat.
[2:20:24] the fruit of the vine. Take and drink.
[2:20:33] Won't you just thank him? Thank him just
[2:20:36] now. Father,
[2:20:39] on Father's Day,
[2:20:43] I feel this sacred moment.
[2:20:47] Lord, no, we're not looking over at you
[2:20:49] physically today, but we can look at one
[2:20:52] another and see Christ.
[2:20:56] Lord, I I thought this morning early
[2:21:00] with the world conditions of what is
[2:21:02] happening. Everything is in line.
[2:21:06] I mean, kings are in line.
[2:21:09] President's in line. Pope's in line.
[2:21:12] Israel's doing what she's doing. She's
[2:21:15] fighting for her existence.
[2:21:17] And you're with her.
[2:21:20] the bride around the world is Lord, you
[2:21:23] have I've seen you. I've watched it my
[2:21:26] whole life. I see where we're standing
[2:21:29] as a mature bride.
[2:21:33] Lord, help us.
[2:21:36] Forgive us where we've been wrong. Yes.
[2:21:38] Forgive us. But we take this today and
[2:21:41] we just ask you, Father, that you would
[2:21:44] bless this audience.
[2:21:47] Bless us, Father. We're not a perfect
[2:21:49] people, but we believe a perfect word.
[2:21:52] And I ask you to bless them today. And
[2:21:55] Lord, we pray one for another. We're
[2:21:57] family.
[2:21:59] Lord, may I pray that you would touch
[2:22:01] each one of them this evening in the
[2:22:03] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen.
