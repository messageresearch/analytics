feeling this place let's just go to the Lord in prayer father we come before you Lord realizing father that before we ever could think of how great that you truly are you are already great we were already on your mind you are already pre-planting our existence here father and you see our hearts Lord today how we desire Lord to be in a place father that you could fill us Lord sometimes we've just got to get to a place where we empty out of ourselves empty out of our ways and empty out of traditions and empty out of what we know just to come close to you and father we ask Lord that you would pour out that you would begin to empty out yourself father Lord Jesus that word there in the Book of Joel it's such a special word it's not like the English word but you begin to kosis you begin to you begin to empty yourself out oh God pour yourself into your people Lord Jesus father I pray today that you would do that you'd come like you said in your word that you would come and Minister father you see every hand you see every heart Lord Jesus these people have traveled some of them traveling for hours or maybe even more to be in this service today and you know what they have on their heart I would ask Lord that you would be God today that you would move in this congregation and that you would bless your children Lord we didn't come here to see men we didn't come here to be lifted up by men we've come here to see and have an acquaintance with Elohim himself and I pray that you would just move today Father Lord I know that there are sick amongst us I know that there are lost that are here today I know that there are those that are Barren here amongst us but I know who you are Lord Jesus and you will not forget any of your promises to your children you are not slack concerning your promises but your promises are unto us yes and amen and we look unto you the author and the finisher of our faith father we just need a touch from the master and I invite you to come and move through this congregation today let your word be high and lifted up father For Your Glory I pray that you'd set us down over in a corner and begin to use our vessel father for the glory of almighty God we dedicate this service to you in the name of Jesus Christ and the bride said amen amen if you have your Bibles today we'd like to invite you to look into the word of God With Us and there in the Book of Genesis chapter 1 and John chapter 1 I want to welcome our visitors here today every one of you I know there's some from Ohio and North Carolina and different places in Pennsylvania so we just want to welcome you here in the house of the Lord and say God richly bless you for being here here amen I would like to speak to you today on a little thought that's been on my heart for a couple weeks here and I'd like to take it from uh the message of the hour brother brandom says here in the message hear ye him he said you know our Lord he meets in Realms of men sometimes he meets in great groups of men some sometimes he meets with a few we have record of him meeting with 500 one time after his resurrection and then we have where he met the 70 and with the 12 and even with the three and then we have times where he will meet with just one and I love this statement it's been always one of my favorite statements brother Brandon makes that's what makes him God to me is because that he is humility and the meanest man in Santa Maria he would say that's what makes him God to me he he then he and then there was another flunky that I was like the cheapest of flunky of all of them and that was the footwash and flunky he was the poorest paid man of the bunch that's what makes him God to me he was the highest of the highs and took the part of the footwash and flunky on Earth and he walked around and think and we walk around and think we're somebody and the god of Glory revealing the glory of God wash the feet of fishermen that's what makes him real become a servant the lowest of servants went down upon his knees to wash the feet of the very created dust that he made you think about how the brevity of this the brevity of this this context right here that's what makes him real is that he could make himself so high but he would become so low that he would wash the very dust off the feet of the creation that he made there he was down on his knees washing the feet the poorest paid man in the bunch and the worst job Genesis CH 1 and verse one from this text I'd like to take a thought today on what makes him God to me in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon on the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was a lot in John chapter 1 and verse one when brother Joe opened his text from this last night I constrained myself from having a shouting fed but I know what G is doing it might seem peculiar how he does things sometimes but that's just his ways in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made may God bless his word you may be seated today in the presence of the Lord also in the Book of Matthew chapter 9 and verse 10 and I'd like just to have your undivided attention as much as we possibly can here today the Bible says here that it came to pass that as Jesus sat at meat in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples and when the Pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples why e your master with the publicans and the Sinners but when Jesus heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick they that are sick and we realize that that God in the beginning as brother Joe so he so perfectly placed it together last night that God in the beginning was not necessarily God because to be a god there has to be something to worship you and you think about these texts that we are reading here today we realize that God uses prophets to be able to bring the Word of Life to to their position and to their place and God would Pro he would he would liken His prophets under the Eagles and and even when Moses is writing the Book of Genesis he was not there as per se but by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost he is able to go all the way back to the very mind of almighty God he's there and he's able to look at Adam as he's coming out of creation he's able to watch Adam as as he's moving creation and throughout the abilities he is able by prophetic instru instrumentality is able to look there and to be able to see God in the beginning when there was no atams and when there was no molecules there was almighty God that was setting there and then he would use the he would use the anointing of the eagle that would fall upon John that John being the guard one of the guards to the book of Acts he lays it in there he's able to be able to look in there by that eagle anointing to be able to look in there and to see that in the beginning was the word of God when there was nothing else the word was right there and you begin to think about how the message of the hour has painted a picture so that us as Sons and Daughters of God we don't have to imagine what God is like we don't have to wonder what God is like but by the message of the hour we have the ability to be able to look through the prophetic Optics and be able to look all the way back there in the beginning brother Brandon would say when when there was no light and when there was no atams he would take us out upon the banister of time and he would lay out there and he would say he said there was God he said there was no light there was no Darkness he said there was absolutely nothing there he said but in that God was there when there was nothing else God was there God was he did not God did not be God did not just he didn't just create things he was always God he was always Elohim the self-existing one because we recognize that we wouldn't understand what God is but we realize that Jesus came and he said no man ha seen God but the only begotten of the father he hath declared him and when Jesus become he was standing there and we were literally Watching God In the Flesh we were seeing him as who he truly was he wanted to be God and brother random would take us out there and he said then all of a sudden he said you would begin to watch he said we sitting there he said we watched that very sacred light he said we would call it a Halo of light as it would begin to come out he said it was the anointing of God the logos of God the word of God he said and it come out and it come out he said it come out there and he said it had he said the world he created the world and the world was there he said it was nothing but a great big ball of ice he said and there that Halo of light went all the way down through the Northlands and it come all the way down through Canada and it went all the way down through Kansas and down into Texas and and it it be to cut out places in Mexico and and there the spirit of God begin to move on it and the waters were there and God spoke and said let the waters go to their place and all of a sudden he allowed the vegetation to be able to come right out of the very manifestation of the word of God that he spoke because there was seed there that was from another world and he spoke life to those seeds and that life came up out of there it was something that was already there but that Halo of light that was there had to come across it to bring that seed that had been deratization out then he created the moon and the moon he he be to watch as the moon as it would begin to form and he he would roll it out off of his fingertips and he would go it out there and let it roll out there for a me million years and brother Brandon would say it like this that he rolled it out there off of his fingertips and he got it to its perfect position and he stopped it in its perfect place he set the moon there so that he could set the boundaries for the sea so that the sea could only go so far upon the land because he he wanted everything just in a perfect spot the way that he was looking at it he wanted to be that but yet there was he was still not God he was so he wanted to be God so he he created Angelic beings so that they would worship him I think that's the greatest thing that we could do as Sons and Daughters of God is we recognize that we're not just here to be singers that we're not just here to be people that clap our hands and say Amen but we are here to be worshippers of the almighty God whether it's in song or whether it's Amen or whether whatever everything that we ought to do is to be if God wanted to be God as the very first thing that he would create his angels then what about us if he would create worshippers that would worship him that don't know Amazing Grace how much more you can make anything your God you can make this pull pit your God you can make basketball your God you can make baseball your God you can make football your God you can make Idols your God but what makes him God to you I don't want to know what the gods of the world what what why they choose to serve that that kind of a God but what makes God to me sir I don't know what makes God to you but I know what makes God to me he is still the almighty he is still the same yesterday today and forever his word is not changing he's still a Healer he's still a provider he's still a way maker that's what makes him God to me that part of God begin to develop something so human beings could have some type of idea of what he was the word of God by the word Psalms 33 and6 by the word of the Lord were the heavens made and the host of them by the breath of his mouth and he gathered the Waters of the sea together as a heap he layeth up the depths in its storehouses he let the Earth let all the Earth fear the lord and let all the inhabitants of this world stand in all of him for he spake it and it was done he commanded it and it stood fast Hallelujah you think that all of these things were in almighty God the prophet would tell us that all of these attributes were in him attributes of God attributes of Father attributes of son attributes of healer they were they were in him all of these attributes were inherently in God and you and I before all of that was ever created it you and I was in his mind you and I as Sons and Daughters of God as a gene as The Offspring of God we are as Eternal as God as is eternal in the beginning he was eternal when there is no more time he will still be Eternal when there is no more Michael Jordan he will still be Elohim when there is no more Tom Brady he will still be Elohim when there is no more danap Patrick he will still be almighty God when when there is no more Biden and when there is no more Trump when there is no more Harris he will still be God hallelujah and almighty God determined where you would be placed at and he had a purpose in every single one of your lives how he placed you here he's got a purpose in your being here he predestinated your coming and he you I want to say it like this you were is eternal when Paul was here and as are you right now you are as Eternal right now as just the same way when Columbo was here you are Eternal then as you are Eternal now come on somebody you were Eternal before Moses ever saw Adam walking out of the Garden of Eden you are Eternal Eternal comes from the very mind of God and you have the identity of almighty God on the inside of you your identity sometimes it changes throughout life you look at your life you look at your baby pictures and a lot of you do not look exactly like you did when you were born here thank God it ain't a whole lot of pretty babies except for those that just had one you think it's the cutest thing but your identity changes but if brother Gabriel stops you on the side of the road and he's going to give you a ticket and he asked for your identity card you are not going to show him your baby picture because you don't look like that but you pull out the picture of the status that you are at the moment maybe let me say it like this you are not what you were when you were first started so pull out your identity as a son and daughter of almighty God you were not what you were when you came to the altar you were not what you were when you met him out there in your car you were not what you were but by the grace of God I am a Son of God my identity is in the kingship as an American the prophet would teach us in spiritual Amnesia I'm identified with her on Plymouth Rock I'm identified riding with Paul with Paul there as he's as he's riding down through there and warning that the British is coming I'm identified when they ra a flag on Gom I stood with her in her glory I stood with her in her shame but if I'm identified as an American how much more as a son and daughter of almighty God I'm identified I was there with Abraham when he had Faith to believe for Isaac I was there with Jacob when he was wrestling with the angel I was there I was there with Daniel in the Lion's Den I was there with the three Hebrew children when they were going through the fiery furnace I'm identified in every one of America's victories and I'm identified in all of their defeats I'm identified in the challenges on 911 but I am identified with a God that rose up on Easter morning and proved he's my God he's more than enough death couldn't stop him the grave couldn't stop him hell couldn't stop him I tell you what makes in God to me is that he came from the ramp parts of heaven and he came came all the way to me I don't know what makes him God to you but I know what makes him God to me he would tell us in his word that he was going to give us a messiah sign that the Lord himself would give you a sign that Behold a virgin shall conceive she's going to Bear a son and should call his name Emmanuel the prophet would say For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace let me ask you something does the name wonderful save you does the name counselor savior does the name Mighty God savior does Everlasting Fathers as a savior does the name Prince of Peace savior absolutely not Jehovah Gyra was a provider but it's know Salvation in the name Jehovah Gyra Jehovah nii Jehovah Shalom but when he would call himself when he would say I am Jehovah Savior and his name Shall be Called Jesus Hallelujah that man child was not Jew he was not Jew nor Gentile but he was almighty God he was manifested in the flesh the only one that could redeem you it was his blood that saved me it was his blood that healed me it was his blood that I can stand upon to any promise that he made God promised God promise this and I want to say this to you I I want to turn this picture just for a minute and I want you to look back there what Moses was looking at when Adam was created and when Eve was created and I want to declare to you that the God that was back there is the god that is right here he's not changing he's not moving he's not getting weaker he's not even getting stronger he is the omnipotent omnipresent omniscient allmighty God hallelujah I don't know how you know him but I know how I know him and his name is Jesus and there is power in his name there is Liberty in his name the name of Jesus can set you free from the bondage of sin and of death from the change of your past but it's it's only in the name of Jesus Jesus is the name of all of Heaven All Of Heaven There Is Power behind it he said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me and when the disciples were standing there in the book of Acts chapter 4 he said there's neither salvation in any other name the name of a pope can't save you the name of a bishop can't save you the name of some Prophet can't save you but the name of Jesus Christ Christ will save you from the worst of sins Hallelujah and I'll tell you this kind of God has the ability to roll away your Phantom Pains of who you are because the name of Jesus will save your memory I know young people you deal with battles in your mind and complexes in your mind but I believe the message of the Hour come to roll away the reproach of your life that the things that you did in your childhood that the things that you were subjected to the message of the hour Rose Hallelujah yeah you got memories here but let the message roll them memories right out of your life if he's a God that can create words and speak them into existence he can demolish your memories hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] brother Brandon would say it like this and lifting him up out of history and I think that's a great thing to do that's what I'm going to do to you today I'm going to lift the God I know out of History he said what good does it do to preach a god of History if he isn't the same today any brother and sister I say I I read of a god of History one time I read of him in books I read of him in the Bible but one day I met him he would say in scriptural signs of the time witch doctors and everything can challenge you to it he said you better know what you're talking about you better not just have an intellectual talk I like that you better be able by God to support what you're talking about or don't get on the field somewhere he said because they'll make you embarrassed you better know what you're talking about when you go up against an Infidel and a agnostic and atheist you better know what you're talking about because they have studied your Bible sometimes more than what You' studied it trying to disprove there is a God so they will embarrass you but I love what the prophet said he said but remember our God is still the god of Elijah he is still the god that ever was he's still the same God he moves in the same cycle he does the same thing he is the same yesterday today and forever I've seen them stand up and be dumbfounded paralyzed and taken off the field because God still remain remains God in Co he was God through cancer he has been God throughout leosia he will still be God because the Bible teaches us that where the word of a king is there's power now if a natural King has the ability and the authority to be able to speak laws into existence how much greater is the king of kings his word his word does not change but the Bible tells us that where the word of a king is there is power if a king can make an authority he can make a decree to have a such and such tax law and that he can beat the people down it simply has to stay in place until another king changes the decree there was another King on your heart that was making you pay taxes to sin but when the King of Kings set upon the throne room of your heart those decrees changed Hallelujah you're not under some Bishop you're not under some Pope I want to say this to you you're not just under some man's idea you're not under some ideology but you're under the kingdom and where the word of the king is what has been handed to you in this generation none else but the sword of a [Applause] king Hallelujah you know a a Shepherd as they working in the vast Countryside they they have the ability to train their sheep to their voice and it's amazing how the prophet would would parallel that to the message he would lay those things in there that he would be in those Eastern countries how that the shepherd there could be hundreds of shepherds working through the field they'd be working but those sheep paid attention to only one voice it was a voice of their Shepherd and that Shepherd has the ability because those sheep are completely helpless they're depending on that Shepherd for their safety for their protection and maybe when coyotes and wolves get to working around the fields they the the shepherd simply would raise his he would raise his staff for he would say such and such word that the Sheep are are are used to so he he he creates a a command so that they're used to I was reading a story about a about a Shepherd that that he was working out in a in a fieldside and he was there on the on the on the Hills there and there this little sheep got to bleeding and the shepherd was watching the entire time and he kept getting further and further away from the flock and the Sheep just kept bleeding but his bleeding attracted a wolf that came around and the Wolf good out got to circling and it kept pushing the Sheep out there further but the but the shepherd simply hollered out stay and the Sheep Stood Still and it froze in its tracks right there stay and the shepherd was able to go in there and be able to retrieve the sheep and keep them from all harm now if a shepherd's got that ability yes sir now I know y'all are I know I know y'all are well trained in preaching so you know where I'm already going you know where I'm going so if he has that kind of ability to Simply say the word stay come on Ruth don't go nowhere else stay right here don't go to this field don't go to that field stop wondering out to denominations stop wondering out to ideas stay stay right here stay in this message stay in this this is the King's word there is power Hallelujah if the shepherd has the ability to make a command how much greater is almighty God to be able to put a message in your mouth put a message in your hand and say stay I'll say this if you put this message in your mouth every Devil's got to back away and Let The Shepherd of the Sheepfold come back in I know you've been through some times when it seems like the Wolves of hell are circling you around but I want to say this to you I am not alone the shepherd is amongst us somebody give God a hand clap of [Applause] praise that's what makes him God to me God means an object of worship I can worship him on that thought I can worship him that his word is absolute I can worship him knowing that nothing else matters as long as I got his word that no matter what you go through as long as you've got the word of a king you're going to be okay because this king is on your side when you didn't know he was on your side he is on your side he cares for you when you feel like that you are unlovable and there should nobody caring for you he is the one that's got his eye on the sparrow Hallelujah if he can walk down when the king had made a decree that anybody that would not bow to the image of Daniel that they would be thrown into the fiery furnace at the sounding of the trumpet at the sounding of music that if anybody didn't bow then they'd be thrown into the fiery furnace but they did not build their idea upon the man's words of a the king's words in that in the in the world of a realm of a man but they had built their absolute on the king's word I love how brother brandham dramatizes how the Angels would come to him said God are you looking down there in Babylon are you seeing what's taking place are you capturing the view of this wormwood came to him gave came to him all the Angels Came to him said let me go down there let me go down I'll go down there I'll get him out of trouble I love go the prophet said he he grabbed a hold of a zigzag lightning he said oh no I've had my eyes on them all night long and there is nothing going to come harm to them because I've had my ey on them all night long and before they knew it he was standing in the fire I say this to you he said God that'll go through the fire again he'll go through the fire with you again let me say this to you they were standing there and they said we will not bow we don't know what he will do but I know what he's able to do and I tell you this I don't know what God will do but I know what he's able to do he's able to give a Rapture he's able to give a body change he's able to heal you to the uttermost that's what makes him God to me before you got in your mess he had his eye on you you remember when brother Timothy standing here a few years ago and he's taken us down this story line some of you how many was here when this happened you know what I'm talking about before I get there I come on now I know I've got a whole lot of new members here in the last year but I know some of y'all are here I ain't got my glasses on but I got a good idea that some of y'all are here in that meeting you remember brother Timothy I know you brother Timothy is going down that line and all of a sudden brother Timothy's iPad starts playing out of nowhere his iPad starts playing brother Greg's standing right here getting ready to play the guitar and he watches his iPad cut on and brother brandham is saying he said oh I love that song of brother booth cbor and he's the song that brother random is referring to is down from his glory now you don't you may not understand the the elements of the supernatural right there but brother Timothy didn't turn the iPad on brother Timothy didn't even have it playing but God wanted to assure to the BR family what they were getting ready to go through with their mother leaving and and all of the things that they were going through God was saying I'm coming down from my glory I'm not sending an angel down there I'm coming myself that's what makes him God to me I love what Paul said to the Philippian in the Philippian letter verse chapter 2 and 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be made equal with God but he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even to the death of the Cross wherefore God has also highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the father that's what makes him God to me amen the disciples were worried about the identity of their Messiah we got to protect him we got to take care of him we got to watch over him we got to take care Peter really thought that he was going to be the guy that really took care of him he pulled a sword for him he was willing to get in the flesh for Jesus there's a whole lot of people that are willing to get in the flesh for Jesus but I want to know are you willing to get there in your soul realm are you willing to fight past your own flesh past fight past your own ideas to get into the atmosphere they were worried what people were going to say about their Messiah when he's sitting down he and all of a sudden Jesus starts acting peculiar he starts acting real pear and he says you know what now y'all go down this way but I'm going over here because I got an appointment I got to sit down with a woman by a whale they were worried about the Optics of what what Jesus is going to look like sitting down with a woman of ill Fame but Jesus is not concerned about the Optics of the outside world of what he looks like because he's almighty God he will sat down with the lowest of lows he will let a prostitute wash his feet Hallelujah he will sit down at a whale just to make sure his seed gets to him he's that kind of a God he'll die on the cross beside a beside a thief he's that kind of a God he will touch a leper and make him whole he'll touch a Blind Man's eyes and turn a blind man into a preacher said whether I done whether he's a sinner or not I know but this one thing I do know I once was blind but now I see he's God and He will always forever remain [Applause] God what about me what about me brother Andrew brother R would say it like this he's not your lord until you make him your lord amen I've made him Lord but what about you is he God to you is he Lord to you is he savior to you many of you whether he's your savior or not he's been a Healer to you whether you've seen him or not but one of these days you will worship him whether you choose to do it here or whether you choose to do it on Judgment Day every knee will bow and every tongue will confess so why I wait until that day let me bow and worship the god that is when I don't see him he's God when I don't feel him he's God when I don't even know that he's there he's still almighty God hallelujah he ain't worried about where you are he ain't worried about your storm he ain't worried about your chaos he's God that's right I love what brother Brandon would say and who is this he said God wanted to be worshiped so he had to project something that would worship Him amen so he said Jesus said to the woman God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and I love what he says he said so when the spirit of God is near what will take place salvation will be introduced I don't know what you need saving from but if he is here like I know he's here salvation will be introduced brother Homer would you sing a song let me introduce you to this friend of mine his name is Jesus he's with me all the time Hallelujah let me introduce you to a God maybe you don't know God like I know him but I have seen God come to the worst of pits and raise people out of him I've seen them come to drug addicts and turn them into sons of God and make them preacher out of him I've seen them come to prostitutes that were on their way to Hollywood and going to make a Fame for themsel he made them a daughter of almighty God maybe you don't know him like I know him but the God that I know I've seen him heal club feet before I've seen him open blind eyes open death ears I've seen him do it before but let me say it like this you can take all the Miracles away you can take all the healings away you can take all the deliverances away and he will still be God to me come on somebody you can take my tapes you can take my notebooks you can take my pictures but he will still be God to me come on somebody my God didn't die in 1965 but my God is still alive and well Hallelujah I love this scripture in 1 chonicles 17-6 I got to reading this the other day and I know that that David is one of your favorite characters verse chapter 17 verse 16 the first Chronicles I I want you to just to picture of this in your mind like a father and son sitting down and having a conversation and God is getting ready to have a conversation with David and David is just heard some pretty tough news David is the kind of guy that he is he's after God's Own Heart he loves almighty God through everything that's right and he looks on David looks on his own life and he's like Lord you you put me here what about you what house can I build you David's David's in a spot he's looking at all the things that God's put around him and David said Lord what about your house and God speaks to him through the prophet Nathan and he tells him said because you have shed so much blood I can't let you build me a house but I'm going to allow your son Solomon to build me a house now look at verse 16 and onward how beautiful this is that even after David goes to a spot where it looks like God is rejecting what he is saying to him David the king came and sat before the Lord this is some this is some major things that you're watching here David could have come in and he could have bowed down on his knees he could have set Indian style he could have just sat down but he's setting before the Lord and said who am I oh Lord oh God what is my house that thou has brought me hither to and yet this was a small thing in mine eyes oh God for thou has spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come and H has regarded me according to the estate of man of high degree oh Lord God what can David speak more to thee for the honor of thy servant for thou knowest thy servant oh lord for thy servant sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all this greatness in my known making known all these great things oh Lord there is none like thee neither is there any God beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears after all that David had been through through all of his highs and through all of his lows he still had an audience with the almighty God that David would say it in the Book of Psalms that I set the lord always before me that I might not sin against him and David's in this position looking at the almighty knowing that his plans are greater than the king's plans himself amen but David could turn and say that's what makes him God to me is said he didn't he didn't reject me he didn't refuse me but he allowed me to sit down even after all of my killings even after all of my mistakes of bringing in 500 different women he still allow me to bring in the materials to dress his children he allowed me to be this close now I want you just to imagine I want you to imagine a very hot desert and I want you to imagine this this weary traveler working through the working through the the desert the sun's beating down on him he's went days upon days without any water and he's constantly going he's he he is is constantly looking and he's his lips are parched his his lips are starting to crack his son's the sun is beating down on him and he is his body's beginning to ache he's been without water he's in a condition he's in a condition and all of a sudden he gets to a place where false hopes starts arising and mirages start coming up and he he starts looking out there and he sees he starts seeing the shimmering of a pools of of water out there in front of him and he he starts running out there and he finds out it's just another false hope and it's it's he runs out there and he sees another one he runs out there and it's just another false hope false hope is like a denomination it's like Amusements of the world it's like sins of the world it has no power to fill you but it'll actually leave you emptier than what you were before you ever got in that condition but as this man is getting ready to stagger and getting ready to fall under the weight of of being so parched without water he looks out there and he sees a real true Oasis in a desert and he finds that there is some pure cool water out there and the man is restored back I say say it like this you may have been thirsty for the water you may have been thirsty for some truth you may have been thirsting for some message but I want to say the spirit of almighty God sought you out maybe when you was in a weary desert all by yourself looking for truth and false hopes kept coming arising but I want to say this to you don't give up hope don't give up hope because Jesus said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for shall be filled filled with what filled with the Holy Ghost you say I come here thirsting for almighty God while I say get your rain barrels ready I see a cloud like a man's hand and it's raining this ain't the former rain this is the Harvest rain hallelujah hallelujah the prophet said the church has been preached to death he said people come to church and say well just because it's my duty sometimes they go because there certain ministers and great men in the land today they really bring out a serpent and they go to hear it he but what we really ought to do is go to church to find Jesus I love what brother Joe said last night I who are you coming to hear or are you coming to hear the word well maybe it ain't your favorite singer maybe it ain't your favorite drum player maybe it ain't your favorite guitar player maybe it ain't but what' you come here for we didn't come here to be seen we didn't come here to look at people we come here to meet Jesus the prophet would say that the days of playing church are over they're over we are here for one purpose to change he's the kind of God that will watch over you when you don't even know that he's there there's a man in the 1800s by the name of everra King he was a he was a Catholic bishop and he was called out in the middle of night one night he was called out to go out to a sick call and he he goes out through there and through a foggy through a foggy walk down through there he's walking down through and he's going to a house where somebody has called him for a for a sick call he gets there and there's nobody there there's nobody sick there's nothing there and he walks back home and he's very dumbfounded about this and he's he's wondering about it well several years later he he gets a call to go to a prison and there he goes in there and his common prisoner there that he's he he's he sentenced to die he's he sentenc to he sentenced to die and give up and and the the priest comes in there and he gets before him he said he said I don't know if you know this but he said do you remember the Escapade that you went on some years ago where you were walking down through the alley and you went out there for a sick call and Edward King said yeah I I do recall that he said well I was the one that called you I was the one that called you he said I called you and I waited for the perfect moment he said I was coming out there and he said I was going to rob you and I was going to abuse you he said but when I got close to where you were he said there was a mysterious stranger that was walking with you that was walking with you and he said I I followed you all the way back home he said when you got to your home that stranger disappeared you may not know but there are angels that have charge over you sister Jennifer before you was ever on that [Music] hospital Lord talk to me this morning you were never alone on the top of that roof but he was standing right there with you he had his angels watching over you you thought Hallelujah you thought that you was all alone but almighty God said I will never leave thee and I will never forsake thee no matter what you go through God said say I will be God to my [Applause] children oh how did you get in this position how did you get to this message it's like elisher when he started praying for Rebecca he started praying and he asked for the supernatural to take place and all of a sudden the supernatural started working it was very peculiar how the angel the Lord started working on Rebecca and here she come out she come out and she started displaying exactly what the messenger had put out there and he started telling him about his father how that he was a richest in all the lands he started telling him about the gifts that he had and how he had a son that needed a wife Hallelujah but what was it the angel was leading Rebecca all that time she thought she was all alone she thought that she was just walking down the stre street but there was an angel that was leading her brother Brandon would say in the and it said time for a decision on decision time he said the message stirred Rebecca the message stirred her the angel went before her how did you get here the message of the hour stirred your heart he brought you here and while he got done talking about it he started Dressing Rebecca in all the gifts he dressed her in gifts of the Holy Ghost he dressed her in Gifts of knowledge he dressed her in Gifts of Prophecy amen but what about her decision will you go brother ROM said I ain't got very much faith in a person that can make a decision and wait till tomorrow to make a decision he said but that's exactly what her mother and her brother was trying to talk her into let's let her wait till the Revival is over see if she really does have it or not see if she really does believe it or not come on somebody I was stirred by the angel I didn't have to wait on a certain preacher I didn't have to wait on a certain man I didn't have to wait somebody lay their hands on me I was on the street and the message stirred my heart the angel was leading me all the way he deposited something on the inside of you you ever been around people kind of like your associate pastor is very peculiar worshipper you ever been around anybody like that just say man you know what that dude's peculiar he got a peculiar way he brings for the church he brings forth the word he's got a peculiar way do you know what peculiar means it means belonging it belongs to that person when you look at somebody that're very peculiar it it's saying that that that person owns what they are they own what they are and and I love what brother Brandon would say he said that that when when Mary and Joseph are walking down the walking down there and they're they're starting to talk about the the message that had been brought brought forth a day and he said he said you you recognize that peculiar star up there now who's that peculiar star belong to because it already been prophesied over there by a false prophet that the star of Jacob would rise and what do you remember you you remember seeing that little peculiar Stars it begins to lead us there's something peculiar about that would talk about like this when he's talking about the boys on the road to amas he said he he come in there and they he talked with them about the message all day long he took them through Genesis to Revelation he started talking to them about about the deity of God all the way to leadership and communion and and the Rapture and things that are to be started talking to him about them things and all of a sudden they they they said that when he when he was about to go on they they begin to pull on him said no don't don't you leave me don't you leave me about some third pole Ministry I I really I really need some of these things and and they were they started looking at him and they they started looking at how he talk them through the scriptures and how their heart was burning how they were looking at the different attributes of how was talking to him and brother brandham said that when he broke the bread he he did something very peculiar that was belonging to himself that they recognize that belonged to him they recognize that that that would that couldn't have been anybody else because that that kind of action that kind of word belonged to one and only person the Messiah now I love when you start studying out the book of Peter that the Bible said that you are a chosen generation A peculiar people peculiar also means you belong and you're purchased the person you belong to chose you and he elected you but he didn't just do that he bought you hallelujah hallelujah he come all the way looking for you you think it's peculiar how brother Gabriel has been so led to put these these testimonies together lately amen I'll tell you what's going on you're seeing it but you're watching watching prophecy come to fruition amen because there was a lot of people that turned down the message and they wouldn't come to the king's banquet because they had something else to do they they bought an ass they had something they had bought some land they they did this that and the other so God said you know what since they won't come and they turned down the real sign that I sent them you go out there and you give me some drug addicts and you get me some women of of bad reputations you give me some people that look unqualified and you bring them in here because my table is going to be full do you think that the banquet house he didn't already know who was coming he already knew he knew you was coming he didn't wait on somebody else he knew he knew he knew he knew that's what makes him God to [Applause] me Hallelujah he wasn't waiting on Billy Graham he wasn't waiting on o Roberts he was waiting on David Pierce he was waiting on Dylan shifflet he was waiting on you he waited for you to get in your position to show that he's God that's what makes him God to me let the world turn him down let the world reject him let the world refuse him but he's my God he's mine somebody give him praise in the house of God let the musicians come he was always there he made a [Applause] way Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah why do you worship him why do you choose to worship Him He said in the book of Deuteronomy he said you will not worship in any other house or any other gate that I choose to put my name but at that place where I choose to put my name that's where you're going to worship me right there that's where you worship me at that's where you make me God that's where you make me God is in that house of worship and brother Brandon he's standing there in God's provided place of worship he standing there and he said you are his offspring you are the jeans of his word he said you are his place of worship he chose you when you couldn't Choose Yourself hallu he was still God he was still God through complexes he was still God through pain he was still God through scars he's still God right
