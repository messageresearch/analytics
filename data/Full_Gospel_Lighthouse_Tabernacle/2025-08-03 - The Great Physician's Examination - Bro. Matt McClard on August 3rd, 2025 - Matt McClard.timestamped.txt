[35:11] worthy. How many believes that this
[35:13] morning?
[35:16] You're worthy of it all.
[35:22] Hallelujah.
[35:25] You're worthy of it all.
[35:32] [Music]
[35:35] For from you are all things.
[35:40] Do you are all things
[35:45] you deserve it? Hallelujah.
[35:49] Hallelujah.
[35:51] How many loves you?
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Come on now. You know I'm going to call
[35:56] you out. Let's let the Lord know we love
[35:58] him this morning.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Let him know, Lord, I'm thankful for
[36:01] where you brought me from. Lord, I might
[36:04] feel cold this morning, but I'm going to
[36:05] sacrifice my feelings. I'm going to
[36:07] praise you in the house of God. I want
[36:10] to let the Lord know I love you and I'm
[36:12] going to let hell know you lose.
[36:16] [Music]
[36:18] Amen. You love him this morning. Well, I
[36:21] got a little bit of a testimony I got to
[36:22] tell you this morning. Uh and mainly
[36:25] because I don't want to misconstrued.
[36:29] I was on my way to work Tuesday morning
[36:31] about eighth of a mile, tenth of a mile
[36:33] in front of me, the
[36:35] dump truck, left front tire went out.
[36:37] We're going 70 75 miles an hour. And
[36:40] man, he threw everything in the back of
[36:42] his dump truck all the way. It looked
[36:43] like a big cloud of dust. Couldn't see
[36:45] either lane. Couldn't see past it. Was
[36:47] coming off the overpass there at
[36:48] Fischerville. And
[36:51] smoke the dust settled and he's on the
[36:53] side of the road, flipped upside on his
[36:55] left side, and immediately catches on
[36:58] fire.
[37:00] So I pull over. I'm like, what do I do?
[37:04] So we get out of the car and I run
[37:05] across 64, get about halfway there. I
[37:07] don't know if he's alive. I don't know
[37:08] if he's what what you know. Halfway
[37:11] there, I told Brother Gab, I'm like, "Am
[37:12] I dumb? You know, thing's on fire.
[37:15] You're running toward it." He rolls out.
[37:18] I get about halfway there, he rolls out.
[37:20] So, I did not pull him out. I did not go
[37:22] in there after him. I did not get
[37:24] burned. I did not cut a anything. He
[37:28] rolls out and he's on fire. Shirt's on
[37:30] fire. His hair's on fire.
[37:33] Starts rolling on the ground. I helped
[37:36] Patty him out and I said, "Buddy, we got
[37:37] to get away from this thing right now."
[37:39] And he looks at me and goes, "I got to
[37:40] get out." I said, "You're out. You're
[37:43] out."
[37:45] So, we kind of convinced him. I said,
[37:47] "Man, we got to go." We walked away
[37:49] about 50 yards and three or four more
[37:51] times while we were standing there, it
[37:53] blew up.
[37:56] Paramedic showed up. Another paramedic
[37:58] showed up. They just stopped on the
[37:59] road. God knows what he's doing. I told
[38:02] the police officer what happened. and I
[38:03] walked to my car and drove away.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; It was like I was in a movie. It was
[38:09] like how in the world I tried to call my
[38:11] wife and she wouldn't she was at work
[38:13] and I called Andrew. I'm like
[38:17] literally I think it took me three or
[38:18] four hours to pull myself together about
[38:20] what just happened. I got a hold of the
[38:22] state police the next day, got the guy's
[38:25] name. I called him. He was a VCU. He
[38:28] called me back.
[38:30] His name is Luther Clevenger. He's
[38:33] burned bad.
[38:35] But he was ever so thankful that I was
[38:36] there. And I give God praise.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking before I came
[38:41] out here, if I was two seconds earlier
[38:44] or a second earlier, I could have been
[38:46] on the left side of him going with him.
[38:49] You never know when it's your time. You
[38:52] never know.
[38:54] I'm telling you, I went away from there.
[38:56] I'm like that I had to convince myself
[38:58] it happened. It was like that happened.
[39:02] that really happened. But don't
[39:04] misconstrue it. I didn't pull him out.
[39:06] I'm no hero in my mind by any means. I
[39:10] believe everybody would have done the
[39:11] same thing. But I just forgot to tell
[39:13] you, so you heard it from me. Amen. So,
[39:15] Amen. How many loves the Lord today.
[39:17] Amen.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; I'm excited to be in church.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; I'm excited to hear what the Lord's got
[39:23] to say.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's go
[39:28] into the word of God. How many enjoyed
[39:29] that last night?
[39:31] Man, that was good. I thought, man, I
[39:32] got to follow that. He just explained
[39:35] the whole message.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; I needed it.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; I know there's some of you just started
[39:42] walking in this message. How many to
[39:44] help you?
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Good to hear it explained out. Simple.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; I love God's gifts.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; I love Brother William, man. Able to
[39:52] take something like that and just go.
[39:55] My brain would have been you guys been
[39:58] like,
[39:59] "Sorry, my pastor done labeled me Red
[40:02] Bull." So, here we go.
[40:05] I wasn't even in the building.
[40:08] I heard it afterwards. Matthew chapter
[40:09] 9, if you have your Bibles, we're done.
[40:11] How many uh appreciates our musicians?
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was going to tell Sister Katie,
[40:20] Sister Connie, and Sister Cassie, we
[40:23] miss you.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we kind of miss those guys
[40:26] that are with you.
[40:28] No, we we truly miss them when they're
[40:30] gone. It was weird sitting over there by
[40:31] yourself.
[40:33] I'm gonna say, "Yeah, baby. You ready?"
[40:35] Brother William,
[40:38] just calm my nerves here. Brother
[40:40] William said, "You know," he said, "When
[40:41] your wife sends you that and you feel
[40:43] the vibe behind it," I was like, "Yeah,
[40:44] baby." I was like, "It ain't church
[40:46] unless we have one of those." But Amen.
[40:49] Matthew chapter 9, if you have your
[40:50] Bibles, let's just bow our hearts before
[40:52] we open the word.
[40:55] If you have a need upon your heart, why
[40:58] don't you just lift your hand? Say,
[41:00] "Father,
[41:02] come by my way.
[41:04] Move him out of the way. Father, speak
[41:07] to my heart, Lord.
[41:09] Father, we bow our hearts before you,
[41:11] Lord, in your presence, Lord, knowing
[41:13] you're an ontime God. You're real, Lord.
[41:15] You're a God that can be felt be touched
[41:18] by the feeling of our affirmities.
[41:19] Father, Lord, we come together, Lord, as
[41:21] a needy people, Lord. each one of us,
[41:23] Lord God. Lord, we're in need of you to
[41:25] pass by our way, Father. There's things,
[41:28] Lord God, we want to talk about, Lord,
[41:29] there's things we don't understand, but
[41:31] Father, I pray that the Holy Ghost would
[41:33] come, Lord, and begin to just speak
[41:35] directly, Lord, to your people's need,
[41:37] Lord. You know what they have need of,
[41:38] Lord. You knew this meeting before the
[41:40] foundational world. Lord, you set it all
[41:42] up, Father. And God, you don't set
[41:44] something up for it not to be great,
[41:46] Lord. So, God, we come in expectation
[41:49] today, Lord, of a great outpouring of
[41:51] thy spirit, God. May you move amongst
[41:53] your people, Lord. And may we leave
[41:55] here, Lord, like those on the way to
[41:56] Emmas, Lord. Did not our hearts burn
[41:59] within us as you talk to us along the
[42:01] way. And Father, we'll be very careful
[42:04] to give you all praise and all glory for
[42:07] you are worthy of it all. Lord, I pray
[42:10] that you be with Andrew this morning.
[42:12] Father, use him again, Lord. Strengthen
[42:14] him in his body, Lord. Be with his
[42:15] voice, Father. and God, minister your
[42:17] word, Lord God, that those people might
[42:19] be completely set free in your name. The
[42:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[42:25] Amen. And amen. If you have your Bibles
[42:27] this morning, let's turn to Matthew
[42:29] chapter 9. Yeah.
[42:40] Start reading at verse 11, then we'll go
[42:42] to Psalms 41. Matthew chapter 9. Let's
[42:45] start reading at verse nine. And Jesus
[42:47] path forth from this from this. He saw a
[42:50] man named Matthew sitting at the receipt
[42:52] of cuspen and said unto him, "Follow
[42:54] me." And he arose and followed him. And
[42:58] it came to pass as Jesus sat at meat in
[43:00] the house. Behold, many publicans and
[43:01] sinners came and sat down with him and
[43:03] his disciples. And when the Pharisees
[43:06] saw it, they said unto his his
[43:07] disciples, "Why eatth your master with
[43:09] publicans and sinners?" You know, I
[43:12] don't think Jesus likes that attitude.
[43:16] And when Jesus heard that, he said unto
[43:18] them, they that behold need not a
[43:20] physician, but they that are sick. But
[43:23] go ye and learn what that meanth. I will
[43:25] have mercy and not sacrifice, for I am
[43:27] not come to call the righteous, but
[43:30] sinners to repentance. In Psalms chapter
[43:32] 41,
[43:34] just want to pick up one verse there.
[43:36] Psalms chapter 41
[43:42] verse verse four.
[43:46] I said, 'Lord,
[43:48] be merciful unto me. Heal my soul, for I
[43:52] have sinned against thee. You may have
[43:53] your seats this morning. Just want to
[43:55] take a thought if I might by the help of
[43:57] the Lord. And the great physician's
[43:59] examination.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; The great physician's examination. I
[44:04] don't know if you know it or not, but
[44:05] you just walked into a hospital.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; I know there's probably about 15 or 20
[44:09] of you just got nervous.
[44:12] How many I know there's people that walk
[44:14] in a hospital. My dad walks into a
[44:15] hospital and he immediately gets
[44:17] nauseated. He goes, "I don't know what
[44:18] the smell of is. I don't know what it is
[44:20] about it, but you just walked into a
[44:22] hospital today
[44:24] and there's a great physician that's in
[44:27] the building
[44:28] &gt;&gt; and he's here to give you an examination
[44:30] and he's here to let you know what you
[44:32] have need of." Amen.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you go back there to
[44:36] Matthew, that word whole means to be
[44:39] strong, to be strong in body, to be
[44:42] robos, robust, to be in sound health, to
[44:46] have power, to have power shown by
[44:49] extraordinary deeds, to exert, wield
[44:53] power, to have strength, to overcome.
[44:56] How many say amen?
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've come into the house of God
[44:59] and you raised your hands stating,
[45:01] "Father, I have a need this morning."
[45:04] And I don't know what that need is, but
[45:05] there's a God in heaven that knows your
[45:07] need this morning. I believe there's
[45:09] some people in the house of God that
[45:11] have need of healing this morning. Not
[45:13] just physical healing, but they have
[45:14] need of spiritual healing. As we walk
[45:16] along this walk and we fight our
[45:18] battles, there's times we get wounded.
[45:20] There's times we get hurt and we need to
[45:22] get into the hospital. And that is
[45:25] church.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; This is church. Amen. We don't come just
[45:29] to find out where we're doing good. We
[45:31] come to find out, Lord, where do I need
[45:34] to do better? Lord, what can I do? Where
[45:37] do I need your touch? I don't come just
[45:40] to play church. This is something very
[45:42] important. There's physical healing.
[45:45] There's spiritual healing happening in
[45:47] the church of the living God. And we're
[45:49] here this morning. Let the great
[45:51] physician touch your life.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:58] David himself, anointed of God, would
[46:00] say, "Lord, heal my soul."
[46:04] &gt;&gt; What was that third poll? There was
[46:06] healing in the soul. Saints of God, we
[46:09] need healing today. There's some of you,
[46:11] I don't know where you've been. I don't
[46:13] know what's happened in your life.
[46:14] You've come through some very hard
[46:16] things. And healing sometimes takes
[46:19] time.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; It takes time. You don't get healed
[46:23] overnight, but little by little by
[46:26] coming to church and getting into the
[46:28] spoken word, that word comes over your
[46:30] life and it begins to touch you. It
[46:32] begins to heal you. I know I'm preaching
[46:34] this morning. How do you know that,
[46:36] brother Matt? I'm an example of the
[46:38] healing power of sitting in a church
[46:40] service.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; How many's ever come to church
[46:46] &gt;&gt; and maybe you fought the whole way you
[46:48] didn't want to come?
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Hey, be honest with yourself. You didn't
[46:52] feel like it. You didn't feel like a
[46:54] Christian. You felt like the worst.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; But you got in the presence of God and
[46:59] the word of God begin to came over your
[47:02] body. What was it? It was the great
[47:04] physician speaking to your need.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you didn't miss it?
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[47:18] Brother say this. So, I believe there's
[47:21] a need for a healing in tonight more
[47:23] than a physical healing. I believe it's
[47:26] a spiritual healing of the sickest body
[47:29] I know of.
[47:32] The body of Jesus Christ is the sickest
[47:34] body I know of. It's so broke up in so
[47:36] many different denominations and
[47:38] factions and you almost could put the
[47:40] message of the hour right here, too.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy.
[47:49] And we're so And so we're trying to do
[47:52] our best for the gospel to heal the
[47:54] broken body that all the people might
[47:56] come together in one great unity. I
[48:01] didn't say compromise, but the word of
[48:03] God brings the body together in one
[48:06] great unity. That's what this message
[48:09] came for. Not to separate us from this,
[48:11] that, and the other, but to bring us
[48:13] together in one great unity.
[48:18] Brother Bam said this is what this is
[48:20] that was in I never read where I get
[48:24] these from. But if you want my notes, I
[48:25] will send them to you.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; God gave it to for you anyway.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; If you can understand what I wrote down,
[48:33] go ahead.
[48:35] Doesn't we would see Jesus. This is in
[48:36] go away Jesus in 63. But there's more to
[48:39] the ministry than divine healing. See,
[48:41] the sickest body I know of tonight is a
[48:43] so-called body of Jesus Christ. It needs
[48:45] spiritual healing.
[48:50] How many believes if it needs it,
[48:52] there's a great position that's on the
[48:54] scene to give it.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Say, "But man, I'm doing pretty good."
[48:57] Amen. That's all right. You still need a
[49:00] hand of God.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; There are people had cancers for years,
[49:06] didn't realize they had it.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Wow. That's good. You can have something
[49:13] hidden in your life that God wants to
[49:15] expose today. And it's not to to beat
[49:17] you down. It's not for you to hurt. It's
[49:19] not for you to say woy woy woy. It's for
[49:22] you to say if the great physician showed
[49:25] it to me, then the great physician has
[49:27] grace and mercy that I can walk
[49:29] differently than what I came in. The
[49:31] great physician does a wonderful job.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; You know, in the medical field, they
[49:38] talk about selling somebody up. So
[49:40] basically when you come to restoration,
[49:41] hey, MRI is wonderful. It's a great
[49:44] place. Go lay in that tube and get beat
[49:45] on.
[49:47] You know, they they try, oh, Matt's a
[49:48] great guy, but let me tell you about my
[49:50] Jesus.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I got enough time. He's
[49:54] the greatest that ever walked the face
[49:55] of the earth. He's the greatest
[49:57] physician. He's never lost a case. He's
[49:59] never misdiagnosed a case. He always
[50:01] says the right word at the right time.
[50:03] He knows exactly what he's doing. He
[50:05] knows exactly what you have need of.
[50:07] Even though you don't know what you have
[50:09] need of, even though you resent the word
[50:11] of God when it comes over top of you,
[50:13] why don't you quit doing that and say,
[50:15] "Listen, that's God speaking to me. I
[50:18] need to hear that."
[50:24] Well, glory.
[50:27] So, you get to the hospital.
[50:30] What do you got to do? Check in.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a process. First of all, UVA,
[50:37] man, you got to park
[50:40] who knows where. Listen, I have to park
[50:43] a mile away.
[50:48] Just food for thought, I guess. I don't
[50:50] know.
[50:52] But you got It's all stressful. You got
[50:55] to go here and then my appointment's at
[50:57] 2 o'clock and I got to get here and I
[51:00] got to go here and I got to get
[51:03] 64 is a mess.
[51:07] It's the way it all works. But you got
[51:09] to go to registration. You know why you
[51:11] got to go to registration? You got to
[51:13] get identified. Oh, glory.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Let's preach some some identification.
[51:17] Who are you this morning? Do you know
[51:19] who you are this morning? Do you know
[51:21] what this message called you to be?
[51:22] Amen. Do you know who you are? Or have
[51:24] you got some spiritual amnesia that Dr.
[51:27] Jesus need to make need to bring to your
[51:28] remembrance where he brought you? What
[51:30] he's done in your life? I know what it's
[51:32] like to go through trials. I know what
[51:34] it's like to go through valleys. Brother
[51:35] Andrew said it. That's one of the tricks
[51:37] of the devil. He tries to get you. How
[51:38] many How many's ever forgot what God did
[51:40] yesterday?
[51:42] &gt;&gt; I'll give you an example in the Bible.
[51:44] What they did, it says they broke the
[51:46] five loaves and fishes and fed 5,000.
[51:48] They got in a boat and the boat started
[51:50] rocking and they already forgot what God
[51:53] did for them the day before.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Couldn't the God that fed you here get
[52:00] you out of the storm over here?
[52:05] Come on, somebody.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; You get some. You forget who you are
[52:13] sometimes dayto day.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just preach where you live.
[52:17] That's all right. You go ahead and live
[52:19] with me. Sometimes you forget who you
[52:21] are.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; But let's identify this morning with a
[52:25] supernatural God that is supernatural
[52:27] and he's on time every time. He's not
[52:30] just an intellectual God. He's a God
[52:32] that's supernatural. And I have a
[52:35] supernatural birth.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; They want to know your name.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; You know what your name is? Mrs.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; What's your identity? I'm identified
[52:49] with this message.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; I don't care if people want to hide from
[52:52] it. I'm identified with William Mary
[52:54] Brantham. He was my prophet and he gave
[52:56] me the word of the Lord for this hour
[52:59] and I'm feasting on the word of the Lord
[53:01] and it's changing my body.
[53:06] [Applause]
[53:09] &gt;&gt; I got to catch one scripture. Let me
[53:11] back up. You ready?
[53:14] My soul thirsteth for God. Hungry and
[53:16] thirsty. This is Psalms 175. Hungry and
[53:18] thirsty, their soul faintth. You know
[53:21] what? If you're hungry and thirsty, why
[53:22] don't you just eat? If your soul's
[53:24] fainting, if you feel like you can't
[53:26] walk, listen, we had some people
[53:27] fainting last week. If you feel like you
[53:29] can't walk the right way and you ain't
[53:30] got enough strength to walk, well, let
[53:32] me tell you, why don't you just feed
[53:35] &gt;&gt; for the man I turn the tape on and I
[53:37] don't understand anything. That's all
[53:38] right. You turn that tape on and say,
[53:41] "Father, give me the understanding.
[53:44] Speak to my heart. Give me one word,
[53:46] Lord."
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by what? Hearing.
[53:53] So when you get that food and that faith
[53:56] begins to, you know what you do? You
[53:58] just keep on walking.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Sorry for the backtrack. It was good.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; You know, spiritual amnesia, but the man
[54:08] would teach us comes by shock, worry,
[54:11] getting between two opinions.
[54:14] Listen, some of you have been shocked by
[54:16] something in your life. Maybe somebody
[54:18] died quickly.
[54:20] Maybe a diagnosis shocked you
[54:26] and all of a sudden, yeah, it got quiet.
[54:28] I am one, don't I?
[54:30] All of a sudden, you begin to I guess
[54:33] God doesn't really love me. I don't
[54:35] really have what I what I thought I
[54:37] Okay, these thoughts don't go through
[54:38] your mind.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; But recognize where that thoughts come
[54:41] from.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; And say, you know what? I know who I am.
[54:44] Yay. Though I walk through the valley of
[54:46] the shadow of death, I will fear no
[54:48] evil. If he send me to hell, I'll praise
[54:51] him. Wherever he sends me, that's the
[54:55] time to really show him, Lord, I love
[54:59] you.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Some of you need to do it.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; But I only do that when I feel like.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Won't you sacrifice your feelings and
[55:14] say, "You know what? I don't feel like
[55:15] it, but he's worthy of it all. He's
[55:18] worthy of it all. He's worthy of my
[55:20] hands being lifted up. He's worthy of my
[55:22] mouth singing praises. He's worthy of my
[55:24] shout. He's worthy of my dance. He's
[55:26] worthy of everything I've got. He's my
[55:29] God and my savior, my great physician.
[55:32] And he's in the building this morning.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he'll bring all things to
[55:39] remembrance.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; So, as you're sitting there and God
[55:42] begins to remind you, look where you
[55:45] came from.
[55:48] Look where you came from.
[55:50] Look where you came from. Brother
[55:52] Vernon, he's brought you a mighty long
[55:53] way, ain't he?
[55:55] &gt;&gt; You know what? He doesn't stop there.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; He going to take you all the way, buddy.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; He's brought you a mighty long way.
[56:05] I know sometimes we get in the trials
[56:06] and the hardship. We forget that. But
[56:09] let God speak to your heart. Say, "Did
[56:11] not I beat you here? Did not I
[56:13] financially bring you through there? Did
[56:15] not I touch you when you were sick? Did
[56:16] not I hear your plan? Then why would you
[56:19] be doubting right now? The same God that
[56:21] brought you through the Red Sea is the
[56:23] same God that's taking you to a promised
[56:24] land. The same God is in the building.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Oh man.
[56:34] You know, some people don't want to be
[56:36] identified with the supernatural,
[56:38] but I don't know about you, in this day
[56:40] and age, we need the supernatural moving
[56:42] in our midst.
[56:46] They don't want it. Send it my way.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; I want to see Jesus in every way that I
[56:52] can see Jesus. When I look at brother
[56:54] Gabe, I want to see Jesus. I want to see
[56:56] God moving in the midst.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Examination.
[57:04] Uhoh.
[57:07] 1 Peter 4:17. For the time has come that
[57:09] judges must begin where?
[57:11] &gt;&gt; House of God.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:16] And it first began at
[57:18] us.
[57:20] David would say this, "Search me, oh
[57:22] God, and know my heart. Try me and know
[57:27] my thoughts."
[57:32] Brother William hit this last night.
[57:35] Says, "We try to make our weaknesses
[57:37] excuses. This is in perfect strength by
[57:39] f perfect faith. We want to tell how big
[57:42] we are, how great we are. I think that
[57:43] one of the things that God gave me to
[57:44] text for was to get that out of our
[57:46] mind. See, there's little things that we
[57:48] do and that's what we come to church for
[57:51] is to find out where our faults is and
[57:53] the things we might better oursel by.
[57:56] And the church said,
[57:59] &gt;&gt; if you know you could serve God better,
[58:01] wouldn't you want him?
[58:03] &gt;&gt; But if it involved you sacrificing some
[58:05] more of you, would you want to?
[58:08] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the same answer.
[58:11] Amen.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; And that's the way we come to church is
[58:16] to find out where our faults is, the
[58:17] things we better might better ourselves
[58:19] by. If we come to church for any other
[58:22] objective than this, I'm afraid we won't
[58:24] get too much out of coming to church.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Let that sink in for just a minute.
[58:31] Be like David. Lord, if there be any
[58:34] wicked way in me,
[58:38] &gt;&gt; sometimes we're blind to oursel.
[58:43] We couldn't be wrong. And then God shows
[58:46] the light and says, "You are."
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Give me an example, brother Matt. Paul
[58:52] &gt;&gt; had the scriptures, had the word lined
[58:55] up, going about doing what he thought
[58:58] everything was right. And there came a
[59:00] light. Aren't you thankful for a
[59:01] supernatural light that's amongst us
[59:03] this morning? He's here to give you
[59:05] revelation. He's here to give you
[59:06] understanding. He's here to change your
[59:08] life.
[59:14] I want to hit some excuses. Oh my.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; If we come to church for any other
[59:19] reason objective than that, I'm afraid
[59:20] we won't get too much out of it. He
[59:23] says, "There's so many of us likes to
[59:24] testify and likes to think we're
[59:25] insufficient. Therefore, we make that an
[59:27] excuse."
[59:29] Let me read that again. There's so many
[59:31] of us that like to think, let me read
[59:33] it. There's so many of us that like to
[59:36] testify or likes to think we're
[59:38] insufficient. And therefore we make that
[59:40] an excuse. I have no education. I have
[59:43] no bu ability. I'm unable to do this. If
[59:46] you keep that up and do it that way,
[59:48] keep going that way. You can't amount to
[59:50] anything.
[59:53] Oh my. Got quiet. Brother Matt, what can
[59:56] I do? What can't you do? I believe it
[59:58] was said to you last weekend, why can't
[1:00:00] you? Why can't we? Why can't we believe?
[1:00:03] Why can't we speak to our mountain? Not
[1:00:05] brother Ron. Not brother Andrew. Not
[1:00:06] brother Matt. Not brother William. Not
[1:00:08] brother Matthew. Why can't you?
[1:00:13] [Music]
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; What kind of excuse is coming up in your
[1:00:15] mind? Well, brother Matt, I got too much
[1:00:17] of a pass. Hold on. Go to God's book.
[1:00:20] Where's your past at?
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; I've searched all the way back.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; And I can't find it. Then why make that
[1:00:38] your excuse? If God can't see it, why
[1:00:41] don't you get past that excuse and say,
[1:00:44] "Lord, if you want me, you got me. You
[1:00:47] got all of me. Lord, you got my faults,
[1:00:49] my failures. You got me.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Some of you are still looking. Quit
[1:00:58] looking.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; It ain't there."
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Boo.
[1:01:15] Romans 1:20, for the invisible things of
[1:01:17] him from circation of the world are
[1:01:18] clearly seen, being understood by the
[1:01:21] things that are made, even his eternal
[1:01:22] power and god godhead, so that we so
[1:01:26] that so that they are without excuse.
[1:01:33] Let me tell you, the Bible says you
[1:01:34] ain't got no excuses.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Well, preacher, brother Matt,
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; healing is happening in the building
[1:01:42] right now.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Do you realize God's bringing up those
[1:01:44] excuses why you aren't closer? You got
[1:01:47] all kinds of excuses. Well, I'm busy and
[1:01:49] I got a busy job and I got this. Do you
[1:01:51] really?
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Do you really? I'm sorry. I'm an
[1:01:54] evangelist. You leave me alone. This how
[1:01:55] we go. Amen. We dig right down there to
[1:01:58] the problem because that's where God is
[1:02:00] and that's where God wants to work cuz
[1:02:02] he doesn't deal with just the surface.
[1:02:04] He goes deeper than that. He's going
[1:02:06] down to the root of the problem and he
[1:02:08] wants to see you made whole. Have power
[1:02:11] to do what he said you do.
[1:02:19] Let me give you the I think the number
[1:02:21] one excuse there could be I mean it
[1:02:23] could be somebody else's.
[1:02:26] That preacher looked at me funny.
[1:02:29] That ain't the number one excuse.
[1:02:31] They look at you funny cuz they can't
[1:02:32] breathe.
[1:02:36] You look different if you can't breathe.
[1:02:39] That next breath's important.
[1:02:45] I can't.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Let me smash your excuse with the word.
[1:02:51] You ready?
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; I can do all things through Christ who
[1:02:57] strengthen me. Now, it didn't say learn
[1:02:59] all things. It said do. So, do means
[1:03:01] there's action. Oh, glory. Come on. The
[1:03:03] works that I do, ye shall do also. So,
[1:03:06] the the part that says I can't. No, you
[1:03:08] can't. But if you can yield, then God
[1:03:11] can. The problem is I can't because you
[1:03:14] can't yield. But quit making that an
[1:03:16] excuse to say, "Father, I've come this
[1:03:18] morning and I need healing." That that
[1:03:21] excuse never takes from my lips again.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; How you going to do it, brother Matt? I
[1:03:31] don't know.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Think Moses walked up the Red Sea
[1:03:35] thinking, "Well, it going to work.
[1:03:39] He was human.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; I'm sure that thought was
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; What do you got in your hand? You got
[1:03:50] prayer.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Why don't you start using your prayer
[1:03:52] for your I can't
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, I presently struggle
[1:03:55] with, but Father, I want to do better.
[1:03:58] Lord, I've come to the physician."
[1:03:59] Listen, sometimes a physician just tells
[1:04:01] you do better.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; You're doing good, but do better.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the physician sees
[1:04:09] potential in you. He knows what lays
[1:04:11] inside of you. He knows that
[1:04:13] predestinated seed's coming to fruit and
[1:04:15] it's coming in your life. And sometimes
[1:04:17] you just need an encouragement. Do
[1:04:19] better.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; How many with an honest heart would
[1:04:26] raise their hand and say they could do
[1:04:27] better?
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Well, then do it.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Good preaching, brother Matt. Yeah, I
[1:04:35] was. You confessed it. You said you
[1:04:37] needed it.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; How you going to do it? I can do all
[1:04:41] things.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Christ is in the
[1:04:45] building.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Then why don't you tap into Christ this
[1:04:48] morning and watch a difference happen in
[1:04:51] your life?
[1:04:55] Glory.
[1:04:57] Some of you did run well.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; But what's your excuse now?
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Scriptures. The Bible says run that
[1:05:05] you're going to obtain. And if I believe
[1:05:07] I'm right, they're obtaining a
[1:05:10] corruptible crown. If you go back and
[1:05:11] look this up, it was talking about the
[1:05:13] Olympics.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; How many's ever seen Olympian Mike
[1:05:17] Michael Phelps?
[1:05:19] You know what he did? He ate right.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; He slept right.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; And he exercised to complete the goal.
[1:05:28] Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; But that was for that was a crown that's
[1:05:33] going to rot.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; But the crown that's set before you, why
[1:05:36] don't we run well? Why don't we run with
[1:05:39] everything we got? I'm not saying the
[1:05:42] fastest, but get to running. Run to
[1:05:44] Jesus.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible says,
[1:05:56] "For we have not a high priest which
[1:05:58] cannot be touched by the feeling of our
[1:06:00] infirmities, but was in all points
[1:06:02] tempted like as we are, yet without
[1:06:07] sin."
[1:06:09] He knows what you're going through. How
[1:06:11] many ever feel like you're going through
[1:06:12] it alone?
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; You know what? He's not more than an
[1:06:19] inch from you.
[1:06:21] He's right there with you.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; I don't feel him. Amen.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; But the word said he'd never leave me
[1:06:33] nor forsake me. Even when I feel like
[1:06:36] I've left him, he never leave me nor
[1:06:39] forsake me.
[1:06:42] Healing's happening in the building
[1:06:43] right now. How many say amen?
[1:06:47] The listen, no man can do that. But the
[1:06:50] word of God through the anointing of
[1:06:52] Jesus Christ as he begins to speak over
[1:06:54] your life, there's healing. It has to
[1:06:56] come to something. It will not return
[1:06:58] void. But there's a supernatural act
[1:07:00] happening on the inside of your soul.
[1:07:02] You may not have felt anything. You may
[1:07:04] not have thought anything. But you have
[1:07:06] come into the presence of the shikina.
[1:07:09] That almond tree never failed anything.
[1:07:12] But it went through the whole process in
[1:07:15] the shikina glory that when they took it
[1:07:17] out of the shakina glory, it brought
[1:07:19] forth life.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you about my doctor.
[1:07:32] How many's ever been to your family
[1:07:34] doctor and they said, "Well, I got you
[1:07:36] an appointment with three other
[1:07:37] doctors."
[1:07:40] Well, yep. I'm sure the Chris is
[1:07:43] probably fresh.
[1:07:45] You got an orthopod to look at your hip.
[1:07:47] You got anologist to look at your head.
[1:07:49] You got a vascular doctor to see if
[1:07:50] everything else is right. And 16 scans
[1:07:52] to make sure everything's okay.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; I understand why people don't want to
[1:07:57] tell the doctor anything.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; All right. Some of you men go to the
[1:08:03] doctor and you've had all kinds of
[1:08:05] symptoms
[1:08:07] but won't ever tell them. Go ahead,
[1:08:09] sisters.
[1:08:12] All right, we'll flip that around. How
[1:08:14] many of you men have seen your wife go
[1:08:16] to the doctor and they never mention the
[1:08:20] problem?
[1:08:23] You're in trouble, man.
[1:08:26] All by himself.
[1:08:30] But let me tell you, when you come
[1:08:32] through those doors,
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; when you come through those doors, don't
[1:08:37] you be afraid to ask God for help. Don't
[1:08:40] you say, "Father, I need help." Come on,
[1:08:43] somebody. He's here to help you. He
[1:08:45] loves you. He cares for you. He's got
[1:08:47] more grace. He's got more mercy. One
[1:08:50] touch of the Master's hand and all
[1:08:53] things become new.
[1:09:04] I want to get through to this because
[1:09:06] this is this is a lot of the problem
[1:09:07] right here. We'll come to church knowing
[1:09:09] we need something.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; But we'll sit there and reason it out.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're we're down home right now. But
[1:09:22] Romy saying, "Amen, buddy. Come on.
[1:09:26] You come to this hospital,
[1:09:29] know that my God has got everything that
[1:09:32] you have need of. You said, "Brother
[1:09:33] Matt, I don't even know how to fix
[1:09:35] myself." That's right. He ain't he ain't
[1:09:38] planning on you fixing yourself. That's
[1:09:40] why he died, took all the authority,
[1:09:43] paid the price, that now he can come
[1:09:45] here and give you everything that you
[1:09:47] have need of. There's healing in the
[1:09:49] building today. There's spiritual
[1:09:50] healing. There's natural healing. Let
[1:09:52] your faith reach out and say, "Father,
[1:09:54] you're in the building. I'm tired of
[1:09:56] living this way. I'm tired of living a
[1:09:58] halfway life. I'm tired of giving you
[1:10:00] half of my heart. I want to give it all.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; My God's every doctor there is.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; He's an eye doctor,
[1:10:14] ain't that right, Brother Teddy?" He's
[1:10:16] an eye doctor, isn't he?
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:20] I want you to stand up for just a
[1:10:21] minute. Huh?
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Won't you let the devil know he's an eye
[1:10:24] doctor
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; right there? He stands as a witness and
[1:10:27] let the devil know you aren't going to
[1:10:29] keep his sight. You aren't going to hold
[1:10:31] him back. He stands as a witness. He
[1:10:34] didn't go out for prayer.
[1:10:38] The angel Lord passed by his way and
[1:10:40] here he stands able to see.
[1:10:45] I'm not just talking about a natural
[1:10:46] healing. I'm talking about a
[1:10:48] supernatural revelation of the word of
[1:10:50] God that now you don't see this message
[1:10:52] is just a bunch of dos and don'ts and
[1:10:54] God sent a prophet but it's the reality
[1:10:56] of Jesus Christ in this age in this hour
[1:10:59] and it's open your eyes to let you know
[1:11:01] not only who he is but who you are come
[1:11:05] out of her my people.
[1:11:14] Hallelujah. He's here to put some eyes
[1:11:16] have on you.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Well, man, I feel like I need to see
[1:11:23] more.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; How many wants to see more?
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Well, you're in luck. Not in luck.
[1:11:29] You're blessed.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; You're more than luck. You've been
[1:11:34] blessed before the foundation of the
[1:11:35] world. Cuz blessed are your eyes, for
[1:11:38] they see. Listen, not everybody sees
[1:11:40] what we see, saints of God. And let us
[1:11:42] never forget that. Not everybody sees
[1:11:44] what we sees. But when we seize it, I'm
[1:11:47] making up words. When we seize it, why
[1:11:49] don't we just go ahead and say, "Thank
[1:11:50] you, Lord. I'm so thankful. I see what
[1:11:53] you've revealed to me."
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; It's not that I can just take it from
[1:11:58] Genesis to Revelation, but when I look
[1:12:00] in the mirror of the book and it
[1:12:02] reflects back in my life,
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; you can tell like they were with Peter,
[1:12:06] he'd been in the presence of Jesus
[1:12:08] Christ. Listen, saints of God, there's a
[1:12:10] supernatural presence here this morning.
[1:12:12] And Jesus Christ is in the building. And
[1:12:14] the great physician is opening your eyes
[1:12:17] to see who you are.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; What's been Andrew's message the last
[1:12:23] couple times?
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Well, not this last one, man. Last
[1:12:27] Saturday was good, wasn't it?
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; That was good. It's all good. Why?
[1:12:33] Because that's what we It's the most
[1:12:34] important thing to a believer. We come
[1:12:36] to church to hear the word of God.
[1:12:40] We don't want to leave hungry. How many
[1:12:42] likes, Listen, you young boys, how many
[1:12:44] like going to a restaurant that you know
[1:12:46] their portions are not going to be
[1:12:48] enough? I love Panera, but my goodness,
[1:12:50] I don't get full.
[1:12:53] [Music]
[1:12:54] They got great food, but it's like,
[1:12:56] where's the rest of it?
[1:13:02] Tastes good, but I want more. But you
[1:13:05] don't come to the house of God and you
[1:13:06] belly up, you ain't got to worry about
[1:13:08] what God's going to give you cuz he
[1:13:09] going to feed you like no other.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; He going to give you the best smorgish
[1:13:13] sport you ever had. And he makes it just
[1:13:15] as real and it's hot and as fresh and
[1:13:17] it's so good.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; How can you tell it's good? Cuz the
[1:13:25] smile on your face says,
[1:13:27] [Music]
[1:13:28] "Give me some more of that."
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; I like where that came from. Honey, you
[1:13:34] can do that one again.
[1:13:37] Well, praise the Lord. Andrew's message
[1:13:40] has been what? Focus. Focus. Focus. Do
[1:13:45] you not realize who that is that's
[1:13:46] telling us it is not Andrew Spencer?
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, Andrew studies this message. Yes,
[1:13:54] Andrew's in his Bible. Yes, Andrew
[1:13:56] spends time in prayer. But when we get
[1:13:58] to this point right here, we are nothing
[1:14:00] unless he comes. But when he comes and
[1:14:03] he anoints the man of God and they begin
[1:14:05] to say things that are not even in their
[1:14:06] notes and he's letting his bride know,
[1:14:08] now is the time to focus. Now is the
[1:14:12] time to let your eye be single. Cuz when
[1:14:14] the eye is single, the whole body brings
[1:14:17] forth light. You are the light of the
[1:14:20] world. It's time for the bride to focus
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; and let the light shine.
[1:14:30] Glory.
[1:14:34] Ghesa
[1:14:35] came into a position in a battle he
[1:14:38] couldn't see. How many's ever been in a
[1:14:40] battle
[1:14:42] and thought you were there fighting it
[1:14:43] by yourself.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; You ain't by yourselves, sis.
[1:14:48] Sister Wanda, you ain't by yourself.
[1:14:53] Not only are we with you,
[1:14:55] the angels of heaven are encamped about
[1:14:58] you.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Andy, we love you.
[1:15:03] Keep your germs away from Sister Wanda.
[1:15:08] You know, Brother Andy, he like that.
[1:15:12] It's time we get so focused.
[1:15:17] Want you want you to be honest with
[1:15:20] yourself. Lord, I'm not really spending
[1:15:22] as much time in the message as I should.
[1:15:26] God sees your hand.
[1:15:31] But there's healing in the building.
[1:15:33] Lord, take my desire for the things that
[1:15:35] I'm wasting time for.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Why don't you confess it to him? Say,
[1:15:40] Lord, take my time from the things that
[1:15:41] are stealing my time. Take my time for
[1:15:43] Come on, somebody. take my time, Lord,
[1:15:46] that I can focus like you're asking me
[1:15:48] to focus, Father. Lord, I've heard your
[1:15:50] word. It's the word of the Lord. I agree
[1:15:52] with it. I amen it. But, Father, don't
[1:15:54] let me just be a hearer. Let me be a
[1:15:56] doer.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; You think we have good church services
[1:16:00] churches now? You wait till we all get
[1:16:02] focused in on one one desire and one
[1:16:04] goal. I'll be honest with you, they'll
[1:16:06] send the fire department out here.
[1:16:07] They'll think this building's on
[1:16:08] actually on fire. But it's nothing more
[1:16:09] than the presence of Almighty God.
[1:16:11] They'll be able to see it from the
[1:16:12] mountaintop. Saints of God, I believe in
[1:16:15] my God like that.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; He's the best heart doctor
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; ever known to man.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; They have heart transplants, but that's
[1:16:27] a used heart going into a new body.
[1:16:31] But God does heart transplants. He takes
[1:16:34] an old stony heart. How many of you How
[1:16:36] many some of you men hard as nails?
[1:16:39] Nobody going to tell you nothing.
[1:16:43] Nobody going to change your mind.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; And you got in the presence of a heart
[1:16:48] doctor that said, "Really?
[1:16:52] Let me touch you one time." And all of a
[1:16:54] sudden, that heart becomes so fleshly.
[1:16:57] As brother Daryl said, "God squeezed my
[1:16:59] heart and it came out my eyes."
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; He's the best physician that ever walked
[1:17:09] the face of the earth. My God is the
[1:17:11] best heart doctor. If you've got a
[1:17:13] blockage right now,
[1:17:16] if you've got a blockage where the blood
[1:17:17] of Jesus Christ ain't flowing to, let me
[1:17:19] tell you, make way. It's coming. The
[1:17:22] grace of God is coming to your place and
[1:17:24] saying, "I know you maybe can't walk
[1:17:26] like you used to walk or you can't do
[1:17:28] what you thought you could do, but I'm
[1:17:30] here to tell you, my blood is
[1:17:32] sufficient."
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you get out of rhythm.
[1:17:43] Sometimes she gets it beaten a little
[1:17:45] too fast or a little too slow.
[1:17:47] But aren't you thankful for a message
[1:17:48] that said, "Onward,
[1:17:51] Christian soldier."
[1:17:53] [Music]
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; What it do? It put your heart right back
[1:17:58] in line with the word of God and say,
[1:18:01] "We're moving onward."
[1:18:03] I want to preach to the one that's
[1:18:04] stagnant right now.
[1:18:07] Why do you have to stay there?
[1:18:10] What excuse do you got?
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay there.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; The great physician says, "Get up. Be
[1:18:19] thou made whole, and walk."
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Matt, I've never been able to
[1:18:24] walk like that. That's all right. That
[1:18:26] just means it's a greater miracle you
[1:18:28] can share with somebody that I couldn't
[1:18:29] do it. There was no way I could. I tried
[1:18:32] multiple times. But I tell you what, I
[1:18:34] came to a service on an August morning
[1:18:37] and the hand of the Lord reached out to
[1:18:38] me and said, "You can walk. Not only can
[1:18:42] you walk, you can live it, you can speak
[1:18:43] it, you can breathe it. In fact, it's
[1:18:46] who you are."
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; He heals the brokenhearted.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; How many's ever been brokenhearted?
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Hurts. Listen, I'm going to talk to
[1:19:01] young people. Listen, young people,
[1:19:03] don't you dare run to get in a
[1:19:05] relationship.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; I know they're pretty, brother Matt.
[1:19:13] Mhm.
[1:19:15] You have something precious beats right
[1:19:17] here.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; And it's your heart. Let me tell you
[1:19:21] that hurt. It hurts bad.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Pray over it.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Amen.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Pray over it.
[1:19:34] That's free.
[1:19:37] He's the best surgeon that ever lived.
[1:19:39] Brother Matt, he's a surgeon. Mhm. Yep.
[1:19:42] He's an anesthesiologist, too. He is.
[1:19:44] Put that in the scriptures, brother
[1:19:45] Matt. He took Adam and put him to sleep.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; And then he performed surgery and he
[1:19:53] brought forth a bride.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Let's take that right back to Calvary.
[1:19:58] Our master went to sleep and God took
[1:20:01] the bride right outside of him and he
[1:20:03] placed her on the face of the earth. And
[1:20:05] here we are in bride time. The greatest
[1:20:08] surgeon, he's still working. How do you
[1:20:09] know that, brother Matt? There's a sword
[1:20:11] going out through the people right now.
[1:20:12] And doubts being cut off. Fear's being
[1:20:14] cut off. Complex is being cut off. He's
[1:20:17] doing surgery on you right now.
[1:20:25] How many watch an old Zoro movie?
[1:20:29] How many ever watch an old Zoro movie?
[1:20:32] Do you realize the word of God goes and
[1:20:34] it cuts fear out of your life?
[1:20:38] Well, when it does, why don't you just
[1:20:40] stand up and say, "Thank you, Lord."
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; You know, some of you don't even
[1:20:44] recognize it's gone.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; But when you walk in these buildings and
[1:20:47] you stand up the end of service, you're
[1:20:49] a completely different person than when
[1:20:51] you sat down. Amen.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; The word of God performed surgery on
[1:20:55] you. God's the greatest surgeon there
[1:20:57] ever was.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; He's still cutting. Oh, glory. Why don't
[1:21:01] you open your heart wide? Why don't you
[1:21:04] open everything you are? Listen, you
[1:21:05] ain't got to be afraid here. We're We're
[1:21:07] in the presence of God Almighty. You
[1:21:09] ain't got to be afraid of being cut and
[1:21:10] hurt. God, when he does surgery, he does
[1:21:13] it the right way.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Let me read you this quote.
[1:21:18] [Music]
[1:21:20] Some of you need an anesthesiologist.
[1:21:23] Some of you need to rest your minds.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; I know sometime you get in that time of
[1:21:31] life and your mind just
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; peace
[1:21:38] be still in Jesus name.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Peace.
[1:21:45] Sometimes our mind runs and runs and
[1:21:47] runs and runs and runs and runs and you
[1:21:52] just want to go to sleep.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; You just want to rest.
[1:21:58] Let me tell you, all is well,
[1:22:03] brother Matt. But but but all
[1:22:06] is well.
[1:22:10] We have heard the message shalom
[1:22:17] and all is well.
[1:22:21] For there is a place a perfect
[1:22:27] rest behind
[1:22:30] that inner veil. That's where you're at.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; So rest little bride.
[1:22:40] rest for all
[1:22:44] is well. Brother Matt, why you singing?
[1:22:47] Because there's healing in singing.
[1:22:50] I'll take it anyway. I can get it.
[1:22:51] There's healing in love. There's healing
[1:22:52] in sin. There's healing in the word.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. That's him.
[1:23:04] Let me tell you how that works. In the
[1:23:06] middle of singing, God says, "You're
[1:23:07] healing right here by singing to him."
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; And then he beats me back to David as
[1:23:13] David played the heart. What did it do?
[1:23:14] Those evil spirits left them.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Who can do that? The great physician.
[1:23:23] And let me tell you, he's here.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to guess about it. He's
[1:23:29] here.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm going say this. You're the
[1:23:35] great doctor. You're the great surgeon.
[1:23:37] This is in prayer now. Lord, let these
[1:23:38] people who are sick tonight in their
[1:23:40] body, and their soul that they may just
[1:23:42] commit their case into your hands, the
[1:23:43] great physician,
[1:23:47] stubborn man. There's you committing the
[1:23:51] case.
[1:23:54] What are you talking about, brother
[1:23:55] Matt? Saying, "Lord, I really do need
[1:23:58] help.
[1:23:59] I've sat in some marvelous services.
[1:24:01] I've seen your power move many times.
[1:24:03] But Lord, it's me today. I don't want to
[1:24:07] leave out of this presence without a
[1:24:09] touch and my life changed. Amen. I might
[1:24:12] not be completely whole, but Father,
[1:24:13] I'll be on my way to healing.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; I know if you you don't do a halfway
[1:24:17] work, you do a full way work.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Listen, when you see that little pedal
[1:24:22] move the mountain, you better rejoice
[1:24:24] just as much as that mountain moved.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Because the same power that made that
[1:24:28] pedal move, that little pebble
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; pebble move, is the same power that's
[1:24:31] going to move the whole thing. Amen.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; He says your He says commit their hands
[1:24:42] unto commit your case under your hands.
[1:24:44] The great physician operate them the
[1:24:46] father. I forgot to start my timer.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; I'll start right now.
[1:24:51] Father, to the extent that all their
[1:24:53] doubt would be taken away. Now your word
[1:24:55] says you are the same yesterday there.
[1:24:57] We pray you use that for a knife and
[1:24:59] bring that knife down and declare
[1:25:02] yourself to be the same. I'll be with
[1:25:04] you even in you. And the Lord when the
[1:25:06] people sees that you're here, may their
[1:25:08] faith climb above every disease that is
[1:25:11] in the building, the sin of sickness,
[1:25:14] and be healed. For we ask it in Jesus'
[1:25:17] name. And full gospel says, "Amen."
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; He's the best counselor you ever had.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. He's the best counselor. You
[1:25:27] got problems with your friends, don't go
[1:25:30] talk to the other friend about it
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; because you just sinned.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; You Oh, glory, glory, glory.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Somebody touch. I'm trying to heal you
[1:25:43] again. Don't hurt you.
[1:25:46] Well, he's the best counselor.
[1:25:49] When you don't know how to deal with
[1:25:50] something, when you don't know which way
[1:25:52] to turn,
[1:25:54] there's a great physician that has never
[1:25:57] misguided one case.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; But the problem of it is,
[1:26:05] have you asked?
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; But Matt, uh, I thought he knew. He does
[1:26:15] know, but he's waiting on you to ask.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Glory,
[1:26:26] Sister Wanda. You go to every this
[1:26:28] doctor, that doctor, this doctor,
[1:26:30] multiple, right? Come to one.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, he showed up this
[1:26:34] morning. And he didn't show up just to
[1:26:36] just for you to look at him. He came to
[1:26:38] take your case. He came to let you know,
[1:26:40] I care about the little things in your
[1:26:41] life. I care about the problems you got
[1:26:43] going on. I care about the spiritual
[1:26:45] disease that has plagued your life for
[1:26:46] years and years and years and years. I
[1:26:48] care. I've known about the whole time.
[1:26:51] And this meeting is for you.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; You're not meeting with Brother Matt.
[1:26:57] You're not meeting with Brother William.
[1:26:58] You're meeting with the Lord Jesus. And
[1:26:59] he's here.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; He's a specialist.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; He's a specialist. How many ever heard
[1:27:06] that? You got to go to the specialist.
[1:27:08] There's only one guy in the whole
[1:27:09] country, and you got to go to Houston,
[1:27:12] Texas to talk to him.
[1:27:16] Aren't you glad all you have to say is,
[1:27:19] "Lord,
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; I need help.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; I'm calling you on your name." And let
[1:27:25] me tell you, he's on the scene.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Cuz you got a checkbook
[1:27:30] and all you're doing is signing your
[1:27:32] name and say, "Lord, I've come to draw
[1:27:34] on what you did for me. You went to
[1:27:36] Calvary for my healing. You went to
[1:27:38] Calvary for my iniquities."
[1:27:41] Oh, glory. Let me get on your iniquities
[1:27:42] for just a minute. Things that you know
[1:27:44] you do and know you shouldn't do, but
[1:27:46] you do anyway.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; He's the healer of that, too.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; He was bruised
[1:27:57] for your iniquities. And when he took
[1:28:00] it,
[1:28:01] he didn't complain one bit.
[1:28:04] They're going to need me in 2025
[1:28:08] in August sitting in there. They're
[1:28:10] going to I want to let them know I
[1:28:12] didn't complain. In fact, I was happy to
[1:28:14] take them. I know what it's like to walk
[1:28:16] in your shoes. I know what it's like to
[1:28:18] go through the things. I know what it's
[1:28:19] like. That's why I came. That's why I
[1:28:21] died. That's why I took stripes. Because
[1:28:24] I am your healer.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; He had an attribute to be a healer. Then
[1:28:28] there had to be somebody that needed
[1:28:30] healed. And I'm telling you this
[1:28:32] morning, the word of God is doing a
[1:28:34] wonderful work right here
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; in our midst.
[1:28:40] All right, I got to wrap this up. I got
[1:28:42] a long way to go.
[1:28:45] You guys are awesome.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; You're awesome. You know that?
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; You're awesome.
[1:28:54] He's the best ear doctor you ever had,
[1:28:55] too.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Aren't you thankful, Brother
[1:29:01] Shannon?
[1:29:03] Through all the other voices, there's a
[1:29:06] still small voice.
[1:29:08] saying, "Come on, buddy.
[1:29:11] I didn't stop it. I haven't left you." I
[1:29:14] know it doesn't seem like it's a big
[1:29:16] loud voice. I know sometimes we're like,
[1:29:18] "Matthew,
[1:29:20] you're an idiot again. Quit it
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; again." You heard me. I want
[1:29:28] But it's a still small voice.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; And sometimes he doesn't even have to
[1:29:33] say anything.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:36] How many You're coming with this big
[1:29:38] game. Your kid does something.
[1:29:44] They didn't have to hear one thing. Let
[1:29:48] me tell you, he saw it.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; And he's not here to kick you,
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; to pour salt in your wound. He's here to
[1:29:58] pour in the oil and the wine. He's here
[1:30:01] to say, "I know you're wounded, but
[1:30:04] you've come to the right spot this
[1:30:05] morning. I'm healing you.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; I'm healing you." How many would agree
[1:30:10] this morning there's healing in the
[1:30:11] house of God? Oh, Lord. Praise your
[1:30:15] name.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Praise your name.
[1:30:20] I got to hit this one. Actually, I got
[1:30:22] two more and then I got I haven't even
[1:30:24] got to the examination yet.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; It's all right. We're going to close.
[1:30:30] 15 minutes. I'm done.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; All right. Who's keeping track of time?
[1:30:36] Go ahead and raise your hands. All
[1:30:37] right. I asked. You're not in trouble.
[1:30:39] You're human.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; 15 minutes. You tell me.
[1:30:45] All right. Here we go.
[1:30:47] [Music]
[1:30:49] I love that kid.
[1:30:51] He's honest as I'll get out. And he's
[1:30:53] the best speech pathologist we got. You
[1:30:56] know what God is telling his little
[1:30:57] bride? It's time for you to open your
[1:30:58] mouth. It's time for you to start saying
[1:31:00] these quotes over your life. It's time
[1:31:02] for you to start saying the word over
[1:31:03] your life. It's time for you to rebuke
[1:31:04] the devil. It's time for you to realize
[1:31:06] you got a voice. And your voice is thus
[1:31:08] sayeth the Lord in this hour. He's the
[1:31:10] greatest speech therapist to let you
[1:31:12] know you can speak and the devil will
[1:31:15] have to move. I'm not saying maybe move.
[1:31:18] He has to move. Brother Timmy, he has to
[1:31:21] move.
[1:31:26] All right. Why can't we?
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Sorry. Repeat.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; What is it sitting there telling you you
[1:31:34] can't do that?
[1:31:37] God's here to take that out of your
[1:31:40] life.
[1:31:41] That your path between here and heaven
[1:31:44] is nothing but a clear line. That when
[1:31:46] you speak, it's as though Jesus himself
[1:31:49] is speaking down here on the face of the
[1:31:50] earth.
[1:31:52] Come on. spoken word bride.
[1:31:55] Come on. You got a speech therapist
[1:31:57] telling you, "Why don't you loosen up
[1:31:59] your vocal cords? I got some singing to
[1:32:01] come from your life."
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; What's he going to say, brother Matt?
[1:32:07] Amaz.
[1:32:10] Come on, somebody. I am redeemed. What's
[1:32:12] he going to say?
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Don't try to sing those three songs
[1:32:20] together.
[1:32:22] He's the best orthopedic surgeon you
[1:32:24] ever saw. How do you know that, brother
[1:32:26] Matt? Ezekiel said, "Can these bones
[1:32:28] live?"
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; And he begin to put those bones back
[1:32:31] together.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, little body. We need those
[1:32:36] bones over there. We need those bones
[1:32:38] over there. We're on the same team. We
[1:32:41] can't go together. We can't go without
[1:32:43] them.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; How about it, internet? We need you.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; We're on the same team.
[1:32:52] the sickest.
[1:32:54] The very point of this message was to
[1:32:55] bring a body together,
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; not to separate her, not to maim her,
[1:33:01] not to twist her thinking.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; So I say to you, if you've got those
[1:33:08] thoughts against those people, why don't
[1:33:09] you draw your circle bigger and start
[1:33:10] praying for them?
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy on them.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; If I was there, I'd want somebody to do
[1:33:18] that for me.
[1:33:20] Because evidently, I need an eye doctor
[1:33:23] cuz I ain't seeing it right.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; He's the greatest neurologist you ever
[1:33:31] seen, too.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; He can be touched
[1:33:35] by your feeling of your infirmity. He's
[1:33:37] very sensitive to his bride.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; How many brothers are sensitive to their
[1:33:42] bride? Okay, don't answer that. Some of
[1:33:43] you probably aren't.
[1:33:51] My wife is me.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; She's a part of me.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; When she's upset,
[1:33:59] I got to dig it out of her cuz she won't
[1:34:01] tell me. When I'm upset, she ain't got
[1:34:04] to guess.
[1:34:05] [Laughter]
[1:34:09] Poor thing.
[1:34:11] Brother Ron made fun of us, but God
[1:34:13] brings two opposites together.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it begins to mold the
[1:34:16] character of the one that's crazy.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for my helpmate.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; You reach over and grab her hand and
[1:34:28] squeeze it one time.
[1:34:31] I want to bring healing to some
[1:34:32] marriages right quick.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Vernon, it's been a long time she sat
[1:34:37] beside ain't it?
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Still care the same for you, don't you?
[1:34:43] I know you've been through hard times. I
[1:34:46] know you've said some stupid things. But
[1:34:48] why don't you just hug one another as
[1:34:50] you leave this building and say, "Honey,
[1:34:52] I still love you more today than I did
[1:34:56] the day we got married."
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Because you know what Jesus is telling
[1:34:59] you? He said, "Little bride, my hands
[1:35:02] open. It's about time. Even so come."
[1:35:04] Oh, Jesus. Oh, glory. I don't know about
[1:35:08] you, but I'm longing for that day to
[1:35:10] walk hand in hand with him.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; He's the greatest neurologist there ever
[1:35:17] was.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, let me hit something.
[1:35:20] How am I doing?
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Good. All right. This
[1:35:24] was the only one raised his hand.
[1:35:27] Guts.
[1:35:33] Now remember,
[1:35:35] not if you heir or fault against a
[1:35:37] brother, but if the brother has
[1:35:39] something you against you, go to him and
[1:35:41] reconcile. Tell him that you've had a
[1:35:43] strange feeling about him and you want
[1:35:45] to make friends and pray and go down at
[1:35:48] the altar and get the thing out of your
[1:35:50] midst of you.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "A funny feeling."
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, we're doing some We're exposing
[1:36:00] some wounds right here. taking the Yeah,
[1:36:03] you've covered it up. Not let anybody
[1:36:05] know. But I tell you what, Gabe, that
[1:36:08] guy one time.
[1:36:11] Hi, brother Gabe. God bless you, buddy.
[1:36:16] I love him. But we do this.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, God's not pleased.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; This many people together, you're bound
[1:36:27] to have a bazillion opinions.
[1:36:32] But let me tell you, we're one body.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; We're one family.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; We have one goal.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; And we're all in this together.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; I know some of us are weird.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Some of us rub the other one the wrong
[1:36:49] way.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; But if you have a funny feeling, you're
[1:36:53] wrong.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; I know that wouldn't land very good, but
[1:36:58] that's all right. Preach it.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; God's wanting to tell you, get that
[1:37:01] thing healed.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; It's time for this body to come
[1:37:04] together.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Matt, I can't." Then you
[1:37:06] get to praying, "Lord, help me." I've
[1:37:09] been there before.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Lord told me I had something against
[1:37:11] somebody. I think I've told this here a
[1:37:13] long time ago. I had Lord showed me I
[1:37:14] had an enemy. So I started studying on
[1:37:17] enemies. You know the only enemy you
[1:37:19] got? The devil and yourself.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Your brother is not your enemy.
[1:37:26] that devil that's on him. Yeah, that's
[1:37:28] your enemy. But your brother, you should
[1:37:31] be able to love them and treat them the
[1:37:34] same as you would the one you loved. Is
[1:37:38] not that an example we have in our very
[1:37:40] pulpit right here.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Is that not the example that our prophet
[1:37:46] set for us?
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; That brother Billy Paul would say, "You
[1:37:49] couldn't tell the difference from his
[1:37:51] enemy or his friends." And brother Billy
[1:37:53] knew who they were. Because I guarantee
[1:37:56] you, brother Billy had some funny
[1:37:57] feelings and wanted to take them out
[1:37:59] back a little bit.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Matt. Come on, somebody.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; That was his daddy
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; who he'd seen labor and give everything
[1:38:13] he could to everybody he possibly could
[1:38:16] and then for them to stand behind him
[1:38:18] and talk bad about him.
[1:38:21] You're talking about some overcoming.
[1:38:22] Well, come on, little bride. Have you
[1:38:24] ever done anything wrong?
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Were you guilty?
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; And what did the father say to you?
[1:38:30] Father, forgive them. They know not what
[1:38:33] they do. Then why can't we with the same
[1:38:35] spirit do exactly the same thing?
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; I want to drop the mic, but I'm not
[1:38:41] going to.
[1:38:44] It's good.
[1:38:50] All right, let me start the examination.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; It's going to be a quick examination.
[1:38:53] You know the first thing you do when you
[1:38:54] go to the hospital? Step on the scales.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; I'll just say this. Virginia's been good
[1:39:00] to me.
[1:39:04] Ah, happy, happy, happy.
[1:39:07] When you step on the scales, those
[1:39:09] scales don't lie.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Those scales say, "Yep, that's it." Then
[1:39:15] you look at them and say, "Is that
[1:39:16] calibrated right?" Yep. Yesterday.
[1:39:20] Oh, by the way, this word never changes.
[1:39:23] So, it's always calibrated the right
[1:39:25] way. It's not for us to change the word.
[1:39:27] It's for us to weigh and balance out
[1:39:30] with the word. The Bible says in Daniel
[1:39:32] when they had the writing on the wall,
[1:39:34] it says to kill, which means to be
[1:39:36] weighed in the balance and to be found
[1:39:38] wanting. I don't know about you, this is
[1:39:40] not an age to be found wanting, but this
[1:39:42] is an age to be filled with the Holy
[1:39:44] Ghost the way he wants you. Listen, if
[1:39:47] you ain't filled and you want another
[1:39:49] filling today, I want my cup flowing
[1:39:52] over that the whole world knows I got
[1:39:55] what I say I got.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Not only that, it's got me.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Next thing I'm skipping. You know those
[1:40:06] scales? You know what they identified?
[1:40:09] Those weights of sin that do so easily
[1:40:12] beset you.
[1:40:14] How many's ever been in service and been
[1:40:16] like, "Don't go there.
[1:40:18] Don't talk about my cell phone.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Don't talk about that worldwide web
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; that catches people." And what's a web
[1:40:28] do? It's a spider. Keeps them right.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; What's it trying to do? Hold you down.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; I already went there. Sorry.
[1:40:42] So the doctor tells you, great physician
[1:40:45] says, "Hey, you got to lose some
[1:40:46] weight." How many wants that weight to
[1:40:48] go?
[1:40:50] Man, where's that button? Everybody's
[1:40:52] trying to pop a pill and this and that
[1:40:53] and that. Do whatever you want. But a
[1:40:56] lot of times to get weight off,
[1:40:59] it takes a little bit of discipline.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; How many thinks brother Jim's looking
[1:41:03] good?
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:07] lost like 50 lbs. I think he said,
[1:41:09] "Praise the Lord."
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; I bet he feels better. You get the
[1:41:13] weights of sin off of you, you begin to
[1:41:15] feel better. You begin to walk a little
[1:41:17] lighter. You begin to not doubt whether
[1:41:18] God's in your life. You begin to walk in
[1:41:20] the true word that God has for you. And
[1:41:23] you put your hand like Enoch and you're
[1:41:25] going to one of these days walk right
[1:41:27] out of here because there's no weight.
[1:41:28] There's nothing of the world holding you
[1:41:30] down.
[1:41:32] You know, sometimes you got to quit
[1:41:33] eating certain things.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; I know. Oreos,
[1:41:40] chocolate chips, milk and cookies.
[1:41:44] Oh, speaking my language.
[1:41:48] Yep. Speaking your language, it shows.
[1:41:54] And then sometimes
[1:41:56] along with eating right, you got to
[1:41:58] start exercising.
[1:42:00] The Bible says to exercise your senses.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but you got a
[1:42:06] sense of faith. Why don't you start
[1:42:08] exercising your faith that God, you said
[1:42:10] you didn't like this. I believe I can
[1:42:11] overcome this. Father, I struggle with
[1:42:13] this. My father struggle with this. My
[1:42:15] family struggle with this. But Father,
[1:42:17] the blood breaks every chain of bondage.
[1:42:19] And Lord, I'm going to exercise my faith
[1:42:22] that I can, I will, I do believe. And
[1:42:25] from that, Father, I'm going to walk
[1:42:28] with you.
[1:42:32] Glory. Brother Brandon said faith had
[1:42:35] what
[1:42:39] I was want to flex in the pulpit. I did
[1:42:41] it.
[1:42:43] But those muscles don't just go pop,
[1:42:47] but you got to do over
[1:42:50] and over. It might be a little bit of
[1:42:53] weight, but you do it 100 times. And
[1:42:55] then the next day you do it 150. And
[1:42:57] then from there, the Lord adds more to
[1:42:59] you. Come on, faith. Come on, little
[1:43:02] bride. Come on. Start exercising your
[1:43:04] faith. Mas, won't you pray over your
[1:43:06] children? I believe your prayer has just
[1:43:09] as much effect as a husband's prayer as
[1:43:12] a pastor's prayer. Your prayer moves
[1:43:14] mountains.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; All right, there comes your excuse. I
[1:43:20] can't. Why not?
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Why can't we?
[1:43:29] Thank you, Andrew. Andrew, set me up.
[1:43:31] Good.
[1:43:33] Next thing, you know what it's gonna do?
[1:43:34] How I'm doing? I got five minutes.
[1:43:37] How much time? Yeah, you got to tell me
[1:43:39] now. All right. Next thing you do, open
[1:43:42] your mouth.
[1:43:44] Thermometer right in your mouth.
[1:43:48] You know, Leodia, each one of these
[1:43:50] church aids, he came down and diagnosed
[1:43:51] them.
[1:43:53] He came down and diagnosed every one of
[1:43:55] them. And the great physician told him,
[1:43:56] "If you'll do my word, if you'll do my
[1:43:58] word, he that have an ear, let him
[1:44:00] overcome." The great physician in this
[1:44:02] end time said, "You are lukewarm. You're
[1:44:04] neither cold nor hot." He took the
[1:44:06] thermometer and he placed it right in
[1:44:08] your mouth.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I want to be
[1:44:11] on fire.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Listen, come on, somebody. I'm not
[1:44:16] talking a little fire. I'm talking like
[1:44:18] Stephen, a barn barn burning on a windy
[1:44:21] day. Listen, there was no putting that
[1:44:23] semi-trail out. If that guy was in
[1:44:26] there, there was no way I was getting
[1:44:27] him out.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; But I'm talking to a bride. Listen, let
[1:44:33] me read you these quote. I'm going
[1:44:34] finish. I'm going finish. Brother man
[1:44:36] would tell us, "Stay constant in the
[1:44:39] state of revival."
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; That means there's no excuse to go down.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; I know you don't like me tearing your
[1:44:50] excuses down, but it's time to go. It's
[1:44:52] time, little Brad,
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; the great physicians in the building.
[1:44:55] Let me finish here.
[1:44:59] I ran across this this morning. He said,
[1:45:01] "He just healed a group of them." Now,
[1:45:02] that's what when you when you can do
[1:45:04] something when revival is going on, but
[1:45:06] let the revival fire dial die down. You
[1:45:09] can hardly The people are still
[1:45:10] Christians, but they're not revived into
[1:45:12] the spirit, the great atmosphere. And
[1:45:15] that does something.
[1:45:17] That's why you create that atmosphere at
[1:45:19] your home.
[1:45:22] You create the atmosphere. Brother Gabe
[1:45:24] in the cop car. He was telling me he got
[1:45:26] caught in a coffee jam the other day. He
[1:45:27] said, "Listen, a couple messages." He
[1:45:28] said, "I was having a good old time."
[1:45:30] Listen, saints of God, there's no
[1:45:31] excuse. We've got the message in our
[1:45:33] pockets all the time. If you don't have
[1:45:35] it on a message app, then get it.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; You can hear the voice anytime,
[1:45:42] anywhere, any place.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Matt, I don't have reception.
[1:45:46] Download it at home.
[1:45:51] took your excuse away.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Get into this message. Why? Because
[1:45:58] we've got to feed on it. He's the best
[1:46:01] gastronologist there ever was. You need
[1:46:03] to eat the right thing to produce the
[1:46:05] right thing. Come on, somebody. The
[1:46:07] Revelations 10:8 says, "What? Eat the
[1:46:08] book." There's been a little book.
[1:46:10] Brother William preached it last night.
[1:46:12] The seals are open. The book is open.
[1:46:14] This is a new book. And as we eat this
[1:46:17] book, it takes an effect on our body and
[1:46:20] our body has forgiveness for others. Our
[1:46:22] body has love one for the other. Our
[1:46:24] body is whole.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; You guys going to kill me.
[1:46:34] Is the people are still Christians, but
[1:46:36] they're not revived in the spirit. It's
[1:46:38] just like in a forge in a black
[1:46:39] blacksmith shop. You got to get the iron
[1:46:42] hot before you go to pounding on it on
[1:46:44] the ammo. You don't you'll never
[1:46:46] straighten it out.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; I know. I just stuck a thermometer in
[1:46:54] some of your mouth. And even though you
[1:46:56] sit in these kind of services, you can
[1:46:57] still be as cold
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; as a bump on a pickle
[1:47:03] in a fridge.
[1:47:08] My show, let me know.
[1:47:12] I don't care if you're sitting in
[1:47:13] services where God's moving.
[1:47:15] What's the thermometer say in your
[1:47:17] mouth?
[1:47:19] What's it say in your mouth? Listen,
[1:47:21] he's a great physician.
[1:47:24] And he's also a consuming fire. I don't
[1:47:26] know about you, you get close to a fire,
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; it get hot.
[1:47:32] You draw nigh to me, I'll draw nigh to
[1:47:34] you. And I guarantee you, you cannot
[1:47:37] stay in the same lukewarm cold
[1:47:39] condition.
[1:47:41] Listen, you see these people dancing
[1:47:43] down here. You said, "But man, I've
[1:47:44] never danced." That's all right. Come on
[1:47:46] down and get into it. Come on down and
[1:47:48] just raise your hands. Maybe you're not
[1:47:50] a dancer, but why don't you raise your
[1:47:51] hands and let the world know whose side
[1:47:53] you're on?
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Well, glory.
[1:48:00] I'm not saying you have to dance. I'm
[1:48:02] not saying that. Don't quote me as that.
[1:48:04] But I'm just saying let the world know.
[1:48:06] Let God know I'm on this side.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; That boy got some happy feet and I'm
[1:48:11] happy to see it.
[1:48:17] Let me quit.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; How many loves him?
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; I got to hit this one more thing. We're
[1:48:24] done. The root of bitterness.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Some of us have every right to be bitter
[1:48:34] about something.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; You tell me the situation, I'm probably
[1:48:38] you've told 40 people and they've agreed
[1:48:40] with you 100%.
[1:48:42] But you know what God says? You have no
[1:48:44] right to do it.
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:48] Brother Matt, how do I get that out? It
[1:48:50] goes way deep. 25 years ago, and that
[1:48:53] thing's blossomed pretty good in your
[1:48:55] life
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; cuz you've done nothing but water it
[1:48:57] with your testimony,
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; man. It gonna be a while before I get
[1:49:04] back up here. I tell you that.
[1:49:08] But why don't you just turn right around
[1:49:10] and say, "Father, I forgive them."
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; And Lord, help me to be able to come to
[1:49:15] the place that I'm able to meet them
[1:49:17] face to face and say, "I forgive you.
[1:49:20] You hurt me really bad, but I forgive
[1:49:23] you, and I'm trying my best to love
[1:49:25] you."
[1:49:28] You know what it does? It grabs that
[1:49:29] root of business from the bottom.
[1:49:33] I hear it shaking right now.
[1:49:38] Hallelujah.
[1:49:40] Devil, you thought you had the hold.
[1:49:42] But as as the great physician, maybe
[1:49:44] he's diagnosed your case this morning.
[1:49:48] But let me tell you your prognosis.
[1:49:51] The thoughts that I had of you are to
[1:49:53] bring you to an expected end. And it
[1:49:56] took a service like this for me to
[1:49:59] diagnose your case, come right to your
[1:50:01] pew and let you know I am your healer.
[1:50:06] Musicians come.
[1:50:12] Hallelujah.
[1:50:15] Psalms 107 and 20 said he sent his word
[1:50:19] and healed them and delivered them from
[1:50:22] their destructions.
[1:50:26] I just caught that. Their destructions
[1:50:28] cuz you stay in that condition.
[1:50:31] It's going to be your destruction
[1:50:33] because right now you have a choice to
[1:50:35] make. Lord, I heard a great physician.
[1:50:39] And Lord, I don't want to just be a
[1:50:40] hearer of the word, but Lord, I want to
[1:50:43] be a doer of the word. And Lord, I can't
[1:50:46] do it. That's right. But the Bible says,
[1:50:49] pray this word back to him. I can do all
[1:50:54] things through Christ that strengthens
[1:50:57] me. How about you say it again? I can do
[1:51:02] all things through Christ who
[1:51:05] strengthens me.
[1:51:07] How many's been strengthened this
[1:51:08] morning?
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:11] You know why? He's here.
[1:51:15] Why don't we make him welcome?
[1:51:17] Why don't we tell him how great he is?
[1:51:20] When we tell him how awesome of a God he
[1:51:23] is,
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; why don't we tell him, let's just make
[1:51:26] love to him for just a few minutes. Key,
[1:51:28] sister, I love this song. In moments
[1:51:35] like me,

[1:54:39] you,
[1:54:41] my Lord.
[1:54:45] I
[1:54:48] love
[1:54:51] you."
[1:54:54] Let's pray together. Maybe just raise
[1:54:57] your put your hand over on your
[1:54:58] neighbor.
[1:54:59] pray one for another.
[1:55:02] Was this brother Ron last night? He
[1:55:04] said, "There's a light that goes between
[1:55:06] you. There's power in your prayer.
[1:55:10] Why don't we just heal? There's healing
[1:55:12] in the building this morning. Why don't
[1:55:14] you let your prayer go forth? Don't pray
[1:55:17] for yourself. Pray for the one next to
[1:55:19] you. Maybe a husband, you know her
[1:55:21] needs. Just begin to pray over them with
[1:55:23] everything you got as we pray. Father,
[1:55:26] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[1:55:28] bow our heads, Lord, in your great great
[1:55:30] physician's presence. Father God, we
[1:55:33] humble oursel, Father. God, you see us.
[1:55:35] Lord, you see every need that's
[1:55:37] represented in the building, Father.
[1:55:38] God, I pray that you touch each need
[1:55:40] right now. God, you've ministered your
[1:55:42] word, Lord. And your word said it went
[1:55:44] forth and it healed them, Father. So,
[1:55:46] Father, may they start seeing healing
[1:55:48] where there were wounds, Lord. Lord,
[1:55:49] where there was bitterness, God, may
[1:55:51] they see new life spring from it, Lord.
[1:55:53] God, where there was hatred, God, may
[1:55:55] they see your hand in love come, Father.
[1:55:58] God, you see the physical healing that
[1:56:00] needs to go on in the building. Lord, as
[1:56:02] we lay hands on one another according to
[1:56:04] thy word, they lay hands on them and
[1:56:08] they were healed.
[1:56:11] God, I pray right now, bless each one,
[1:56:13] Lord Jesus. We give you praise. We give
[1:56:16] you glory. Thank you for passing by our
[1:56:19] way in Jesus name. Amen.

[1:58:19] of the Lord is good?
