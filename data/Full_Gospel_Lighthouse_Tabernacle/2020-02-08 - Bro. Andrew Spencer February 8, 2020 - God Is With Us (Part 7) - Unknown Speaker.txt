may that be said of each and every one of us that we never lost our praise in the midst of the battle in the midst of the season of our pain we never lost our praise amen because when you're praising God God inhabits the praises of his children if you have your Bibles this evening we'll turn to the book of Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 18 so thank you for the atmosphere that has been created here this evening the angel the Lord is pleased well you know where I'm going this evening God is with us and we will see miracles man before we read this evening let's let's speak to the author of the book heavenly father Lord what a privilege it is for us your children Lord to be able to set here Lord as it were to sit down as as you would teach the children on the mountaintop father and they would sit and gather around to hear your teachings father we said here this evening Lord at the foot of the cross father we look upon you Lord Jesus we gaze upon your glory Lord we we know that the the crosses is not a beautiful cross but it's rugged it's a sign of it's a sign of pain and shame and yet it bears our glory it bears who we are it bears what you did for us at Calvary and we so thank you Lord for the innocent blood that you shed on Calvary's cross for our sins Lord where will we be without you father in this moment in this time Lord we just come before you boldly and all we pray that you and move the needs of your situations of your children and we pray that you would touch their lives and I pray God as the ministering of the Lord would go forth we pray that your angel would take the word to the to the address to the spot father in which it is to be placed in and I pray that you would bring it forth lord I pray that you would water that seed Lord I pray that you would come and minister to every single person here under the sound of the voice just now I thank you for what you're doing and what your continuing to do we love and appreciate you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen ephesians 1 and verse 18 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and sat him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and Dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all and if you'll flip over about three pages in your Bible to Ephesians 6 and 11 Paul says here put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood before I read this next portion of Scripture if you look back at a Asians if you look back at your Bible there at Ephesians 1 and 21 it tells us that that Christ is far above all principality and power and might and Dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and over in Ephesians 6 and 12 it tells us Paul says here that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of the world against spiritual wickedness in high places notice all of these things in verse 22 of Ephesians 1 and 22 and Christ and hath put all things under his feet so all the things that you're wrestling with the things that you're battling with is placed under his feet what a wonderful faultless evening may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord these things that you're battling against the principalities the angels of darkness and the powers of darkness and against all the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places those are the things that that you are wrestling with in this hour in this day in this moment in time that you're living in those are things that you're wrestling with on a daily basis I'd say that if every person would lift up their hand this even and they would be able to say that they have wrestled they've wrestled a threat they've wrestled with their flesh they've wrestled with theirs wrestled with their own way and in their own spiritual realm is wrestled with those things but I love what Paul said and in before you even get to wrestling this with these things before you ever get it's so so involved in your fight and wrestling with your fight you can know that you're going to come out victorious through the wrestle because he said they put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head that he is the supreme deity over all things to the church and we are his church the whole armour of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the word behind less less service as we left you last weekend on on the thought that that that we were under a Joshua commission and Joshua was standing there in the book of Joshua chapter 1 the Bible said that there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses said so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor will I forsake thee and we we begin to speak on these things and say that Satan had tried his very best to keep Joshua and the children of Israel off the promised land because he realized that once they went into the the promised land onto that place that they would dis possess the inhabitants of that land they would go in and overthrow the kingdoms of that world and he knew Satan knew that if Josh would got in there that Satan would not have a chance to get Joshua back out of that land because you see in that kingdom there were worlds that were and there were kingdoms that were not serving the great I am but yet there was coming there was coming up people that were going to serve the I am the God that would not change and the God that always remains the God that is always there and Joshua was standing there in that commission as it was to go in and possess the gate go in and possess that land but he didn't tell him just to go to Jericho and then stop he told him to go all the way in to take ownership of every city to take over and when Joshua or when Abraham was standing there in Genesis 13 and he tells him to look out across all of the land that I've given you all of this work northward southward eastward and westward all of these things are yours they are they're yours and didn't you see Abram never moved into that land but here his seed moved into that land you see and here Joshua was standing under that Commission looking at a promise that was prophesied over four hundred and some years ago maybe five hundred some years but yet the promise to Joshua was just as fresh as it ever was you see because Joshua's he was not looking at the time basis he was not being caught up in the delay he saw that as his job to go in there and if I we as the children of a God can ever get that in the I'm on that this is our hour we're the last runners in this race and God puts his best runners at the best time when it when it is the worst of times in the darkest of times he puts in the runners that are built for that moment built to run that race built to finish that race and Satan is going to battle you every step of the way you may feel like you need to stop and have some oxygen on the way on this last round but I want you to know that Satan didn't make you so Satan came break yeah Satan didn't start so Satan came finish you God started - and what God starts God brings it to his fulfillment you see the god of Moses was with them and leading them all the way and and the Prophet would say that that that we're at another fusions and the scripture of the Bible plainly tells us where we're at in this hour we got a road map that is placed before us it tells us who we are it tells us where we're at it tells us what we're going to face it tells us that two hundred thousand thousand demons were released how the river Euphrates you see when the seals were released those demons were released and we are fighting against air against fallen angels and you thought that you had a rough time but you realize that greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world you see it tells us where we're at so we can be fervent in these matters we can go into the battle realizing that these things are to be that we're going to face these things you see if General Lee and Stonewall Jackson knew how the enemy was going to advance and come at them they could go out and they could win the battle but you see they didn't know they didn't have that long-range vision like God had to go out and to go out and look at how the enemy was going to come in and look at their regiments but yet you're serving a god that's got long-range vision and he knows how the enemy is going to attack you he knows how he's going to fight you so he gave you the very best weapon to fight against the enemy when he gave you his whole word science has done its very best to create weapons of warfare but you today have the the most powerful weapon place in your hands today brother Bantam would say it in three different ways that the greatest weapon that God ever gave to man was a committal to God prayer and the Word of God and if you commit your life to God it is the greatest weapon that has ever been given to you and if you can ever learn how to pray like never before it's the greatest weapon that's been given to you and if you can realize that in your prayer that you can take the Word of God that will whip the devil anytime anyplace under any circumstance that this word will bring you the victory it's the greatest weapon that's been placed in the hand of mankind you can roll your shoulders back when the enemy seems to be breathing down upon you and you can realize that you were built for the fight you are built to stand there that the enemy may be a whole lot taller than you but you don't show no mercy to that enemy Oh hallelujah you see the Bible said that no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper your life could not prosper against David sin cannot prosper against the children of God sickness can prosper you name it out there no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper here we are so we can be fervent in these matters that we are under a Joshua Commission to go in and take over and we're going to possess it by the Word of God for the Bible tells us in Deuteronomy 30 and 14 that the word is very nine to be in my mouth and in the heart that thou may us do it notice what Paul says in in 2nd Corinthians 4 and 13 time for a new microphone cord 2nd Corinthians and 4 and 13 Paul says that we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe we also believe look at the neighbors say we also believe and therefore speak you see he said we have a that same spirit of faith oh come on somebody we have in the same spirit of faith I believe and therefore have I spoken we also believe therefore speak so Paul is is a grabbing this from the Book of Psalms 116 and verse 8 for thou has delivered my soul from death here the psalmist is showing you in a place in which God hath delivered him from that he has delivered it my soul from death my eyes from tears and my feet from falling I'll say what a deliverer that you're facing that you have on your side this evening notice what the psalmist says he says I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living he does not say that he is crawling before the Lord it does not say that he's limping before the Lord but it says that I will walk this is showing a person that has strength to get up this is showing a person that's able to get up out of his chair this is showing somebody that is willing and able to get up they're not willing to stay down and their stupor in their condition they are willing to get up and walk and the psalmist says I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living not in the land of sickness but not in the land of Tomoe not in the land of distress not in the land of diseases but how will walk before the Lord in the land of the living you realize where you're at with this spoken word in this hour you are in the land of the living I believe therefore have I spoken I was greatly afflicted knows that notice the psalmist he's going through the battle he's going through the reproaches he's going through the criticisms he's going through the health problems through all the pain the psalmist says I believe I believe in the promise I believe what God said that for I speak it do you realize that standing in front of you is a perfectly well body and you can walk right into it by the power of faith faith is a revelation faith will not to devil down faith knows where it's at faith is not faith will be but faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you can't see it but walk into it fellow Huia you see the psalmist was confident in the promise I found this statement a while back an army of sheep led by a line will always defeat an army of lines led by a sheep an army of sheep led by a lion will always defeat an army of Lions led by sheep you realize that the one that is leading you through and taking us to victory is the Lion of the tribe of Judah that he is leading his sheep he's not taking them half way he's taking them all the way he's talking to a people that he's going to bring them to victory the Prophet said you are following your captain hallelujah we've got a five-star general smell j esus notice placing five stars on us fa i th glory hidden leader for himself but he placed on you five stars do you realize that you're a five-star general in the faith today he's never lost a battle hallelujah he's conquered death hell and the grave get the devil's out of the way he's the great chief captain so the devil isn't even in the picture oh come on somebody the great chief captain put upon you a five star fai th we are not here to be silent we are not here to be pushed around by Satan's Kingdom we're here to push Satan's Kingdom around there's a voice a resurrection that is in the people we have that voice and it is the voice of many waters that is speaking out the last runners of this day they are running with everything within them saying don't give up they're screaming out don't back up press the paddle you understand what I'm saying there came a voice from another realm press the battle press the battle press the bottom that's a voice that is crying out to you Church press the battle look at Samson what Samson it was nothing but a little shrimpy what no great big man he was a little bitty shrimp to have seven seven little locks on the back of his head he was going down to a city to see his girlfriend one day and he's walking down there in a line came out and run out here he was in humanistically standing he was helpless and hopeless but when the Spirit of the Lord came on him he just took that line and toward the pieces and throwed it down you see what what made the difference was is that the Spirit of the Lord came upon him he said let me see a little cowardly Church that's afraid to trust God or a family let the Spirit of God strike that family or that individual that church and watch what takes place brother I'm telling you skeptics fly roaches in the summertime when you turn the light on them that's exactly right yes sir everything moves out faith comes in says I'm the boss the rest of it moves out don't make any difference what anybody else says God's Word is eternally right what made the difference was the Spirit of the Lord you may be sitting there carrying a huge load that nobody else knows about you may be carrying a bird and you're thinking ma if I ever need a church I need church today because I have went through all of how it seems like just to get here you think that you're alone here this evening God sees you when you walked in that back door carrying that load but you don't have to carry it out tonight you can leave it at the foot of Jesus you don't have to stay here burden now I understand your burden it's sin or sickness or despair or distress who can take your burdens to the Lord and you can leave them I hear that's more than a song that's a reality tonight I don't care what you came in here packing and I don't care what you have faced in your eyes the circumstances of life may be stacked up against you but abraham believed in God against all odds and if Abraham a man that was a hundred years old could believe God against all the odds what about you as sons and daughters of God to have a baptism of the Holy Ghost upon your soul that will not leave you will not forsake you but will be with you even in you to the end of the world what do you have to fear tonight [Applause] you remember pilgrims progress in her little and a little Christian he was packing that load everywhere he went but he finally found a place that he could drop it off you may feel like a little Christian and I but I want you to know you can walk up to a big God you can lay your burdens at the feet of Jesus and you ain't gotta pick them up the devil's gonna whisper at you and tell you you got to pick him up but sistercrystal don't pick them up leave them there in the name of Jesus and walk out of these doors completely hope Oh the difference is the Spirit of Christ notice what Jesus said in John chapter 15 and 7 that if ye abide in me notice the bride is connected to the rod groom that if ye abide in me if you look at that word in the Greek it means to remain to endure it means to not perish to last and speaking of person it means to survive to live in reference to the state or condition it means to remain as one not to become another or different but if he abide in me and my words whose words God's words if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ask you shall ask what you will I know it his will is but what's your will is it your will to ask him big things is it your will just to ask in small things it's his will to give you the very desires of your heart if you delight yourself in the Lord it's his will to heal it's his will to save it's his will to deliver but what is your will who ask and it shall be done unto you you see there is a union between the bridegroom and the bride and faith in her make her makes her unmovable she stands there as the Ransom she stands there as the redeemed justified in his sight why are we justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in the last days with the glorious gospel showing his victory that he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory when we see him coming down and living amongst the church that's his victory now you think you have in yourself a good time you think that you're enjoying your time you think that you are enjoying these heavenly places but do you realize that what you're packing is the very victory of Lord Jesus Christ to see you living out in the darkness to taste to see you living it out that you are packing the very victory of Almighty God were the proof of his victory when we see him coming down and living amongst the church that's his victory it shows that they couldn't keep him in the grave and neither can they keep you an eye on the grief I am going to show no mercy on this demon of hell I was born here to be victorious our identity is tied to him bear with me as I give you these these these these double-barrel shotgun nuggets here that our identity is in him he is our headship that we're the final voice to the final age it's not Christ a player and you down here but it's Christ in you it's Christ in you the hope of glory and it is our victory our victory is to receive the word of this hour he said that he would not leave you but he'd be with you and it shows you tonight how close God is and he's always there and he is not leaving you that the Bible said that the angels of the Lord and care about them and deliver them those angels are staying there day in day out when you go to sleep they're awake they're there to watch you they're there to protect you Alleluia he's there he's with us he's even in us in the in the world and you can see him operating in nature you can see God in the trees you can see God in the flowers you can see God in everything but I wonder if you could see him in you they st. God with your neighbor this is God with you he st. God with your pastor God with the deacon but God in you I was asked one time did you really meet him absolutely I met him do you realize that once you meet him you will never be the same some people say how in the world do you know you met him let me tell you you ever meet him you'll know that you met him are you with me you see you have come in contact with me and you recognize when you speak to me that I've got certain mannerism about myself I got certain characteristics about myself I've got certain intentions or I have when I speak to you I'm a person of positivity I'm going to speak you when a level of faith you realize that when you're speaking to me you've come in contact with me you may walk away from here and you may forget my name and you may forget everything about me but once you meet him I want you to know if you ever meet him I'm not talking about a picture I'm not talking about a book but I'm talking about they offer the book that if you ever meet him you'll know that you met him you all want the same you won't talk the same you won't live the same because you won't be the same don't fear to go anywhere or do anything for the never-failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go so Satan can't kill me until God says it's finished he might try but he'll never succeed in doing it you remember you remember when Joshua was standing there he's done across the Jordan he's done he's done he's done got his commission and he's standing there in Joshua chapter 5 and he's standing there and he's looking out across Jericho and he sees he sees a man standing there that's got a sword drawn and he says are you with us or are you against us and notice what his words were it says nay neither of these but you're for me I'm not on your side but you're on my salary with me nay but as the captain of the hosts of the Lord am I now come notice notice what the what the what the angel said him is that I am the God that's fighting your battles I'm the God that's with you hallelujah but I want you to not only want to go in all the details as we know that story quite well but I want you to capture this thought on this think on this scripture here that before Joshua could go him and take Jericho notice how powerful that was how big Jericho was that it was stacked up so high that they could have horse races around the top of it they they were loaded in such a way that unless God showed up there was no way that humanistically standing then Joshua could take it down that's not even the point I want you to catch tonight but before Joshua could ever go in there and take over Jericho he had to have a conference I want you to know that before David could ever take down Goliath he had to have the anointing poured upon him and before Joshua went in there and took over Jericho and tore down the walls he had to meet the great I am and you will never tear down walls in your life until you meet him you will never go in there and take over until you meet him you will never go in there and make your giants fall until you meet him you have given everything else a chance why don't you give God a chance you give trumps a chance why don't you give God a chance you give pornography a chance why don't you give God a chance you gave alcohol chance why don't you give God a chance you gave Hills a chance why don't you give God a chance he gave doctors a chance why don't you give God a chance play with me won't you give God a chance in this battle press the battle give God a chance hello this is the age of life the personal life of Christ were the chemical of his body what was in him this is the age for that if you could ever realize that you are the temple of Almighty God that you're packing on the inside of your soul the great I am one time we were down in Tennessee and we were we were looking we were looking at a studio set and looking at speakers for this church and we were in this we were in this Bose this Bose store and had every imaginable speaker there was and there was this man and we were looking at these certain ones and there was this man that began to tell us he didn't work there but he began to tell us about these certain speakers he said what do you need them for we're so well we were looking for him for our church and he said I he said I'm a pastor of a church and he said I'm gonna tell you something he said these are the best speakers that there is out there he said I got them in my church and he began to talk to me and brother Alden and he began to tell him said you know he said he said you know he said this is preacher had a shirt halfway button down here had a necklace around his neck and look like the biggest he was a long way from Texas let me say that but he began to talk to me and brother album to tell him said you know he said the church is not the building but the church is this tip when he put his hand upon brother Allen's chest and he said that temple that temple is the place where the Holy Ghost dwells and I thought my brother just like Jesus said you are so close to the kingdom right now and you don't even realize it if the man that was talking to us could have had the God that was on the inside of that kingdom he would have walked away with his shirt buttoned and he would have know what side of the kitchen he deserved to be oiled there's a lot of people that claim that God is with them there's a lot of people that claim Wilson look at us look our Turks is growing our church this building we've got more members we got more members than you could ever imagine we've got to be blessed God has got to be with me but do you know that David said that even I've seen the wicked grow in power as a green bay tree but they all perish I look for them I sought for them but they all passed away but he said mark the perfect man mark the perfect man and his end is peace the wicked has an end of destruction but the man of peace come on somebody the man that is the kingdom the man that is blessed his end is peace there's a lot of people say God is with them but I really wonder is God with them many people can talk a good game many people can come to church here night after night day after day but it's really God with them when the rubber meets the road when your burden gets bigger than you can you really say God is with you when it comes down to it when you've got to put your foot on the pedal and push it like never before can you say God is good you got the goods now you're built to stand the test you see because we live in an hour when there's so much science out there to explain of a away the very word of God we got so many critics on this hand critics on that hand hallelujah you got Republicans on one hand you got Democrats on one hand I don't care what kind of Allah politician you believe here or icons you stand on brother Branham said that it's of the devil you got politics on one side politics on the other side but I want to stay right in the middle with God's Word and I know I'll come out with it you can put whoever you want to in the White House but as for me and my house gods with me we live in an hour whenever demon in hell seems to be out after the name of Jesus they don't want you saying the name of Jesus no more everybody's worried about their second Amendment there already they're all worried about that second Amendment right but what about you First Amendment what about the right to worship what about the right to praise what about the right to serve God you let the enemy come in and sit down in your room and turn the TV on and he'll murder somebody in front of you but you wouldn't dare let that happen in front of your children out in public but you'll sit there and let that enemy come in and sit there and kill somebody in front of your children the enemy slinking he knows how to get in there hallelujah the enemies on every side he's trying to get onto you but you can never fool around with the enemy and you can never underestimate the enemy because he is slick it's an hour when all the hell is out to destroy the name of Christianity it's an hour where it's going to take more than a Baptist profession I believe in God and walk away I'm a saved as I ever once was saved I can go out and smoke every bit of dope I want to I can to go out and look at anything I want to I'm saved as much as I'm going to be safe here you ain't nothing but a good Baptist it's gonna take more than a Baptist professor well I believe God sent a prophet I believe that God that God is God and I believe that Jesus Christ is a son it's gonna take more than that you gotta come down to a meeting with Ella him himself you gotta have it in such a spot no matter that you can say that you met God face-to-face no matter if you come up against an agnostic or an atheist you've got to be able to stand there and say I met God for myself face-to-face and there won't be no demon of hell that'll rob you of your of your religion because it ain't you it's healed [Applause] hallelujah this is the hour of knowing in whom you have believed you say well I don't think I can be saved God loves to show his power God is the God of all power so you don't realize how deep ah I am in sin you don't realize how hard I am you don't realize the burden that I'm carrying let me give you something see God loves to show his mighty hand he likes to show his power and he's waiting tonight to show it in you to take that Center and turn him around and take that woman of ill fame and change her to a godly saintly woman take that girl that's taking the wrong road that boy the wrong road bring them back to a place to make sons and daughters of God out of him that's what God loves to do he likes to take somebody that's a nobody and make somebody out of him he likes to come to you when you're at the bottom of the barrel and you realize that the only way you got to go is up Alleluia if you're lost tonight that God is the same God that shed his blood two thousand years ago that his blood is powerful enough to wash away all of your sins come on people help me fish tonight I got the bait on the end of the hook help me fish tonight come on somebody God still God and he ain't changing [Applause] [Music] hallelujah the Bible says in Ephesians 2 and you and you hath he quickened who are dead in trespasses and sin where in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversations I thought it was just you but it says we all had our conversations whoa and don't just put it over on your neighbor or your wife you can put it back over on your husband we all had our conversations in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others what made the difference but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins has made us alive together with Christ and by grace ye are saved I thought it was by my works absolutely not by his amazing grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus you see the only way that you ever know God personally is to for him to reveal himself to you in the power of the Holy Ghost before you ever know it you see without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're only guessing at it you're saying what the word says are you saying what the pastor says you're saying what your mother said but when the Holy Spirit comes in and baptizes you into the person of Christ Jesus then you know by a personal experience that Jesus Christ is the son of God rates what a dead living in you the hope of glory now that is when you can say God is with me when that quickening power that makes you alive from the dead nosov trespasses of sin when that quickening power comes in it's not a power of a man but it is the power of Almighty God it is the power of the abstract of Easter the resurrected Jesus that set back the abstract to guarantee us that we are already alive in him he realized that Jesus had confidence in that quickening power he had so much he had so much confidence in the quickening power because he realized what the word said about him over in the Book of Psalms 16 and 10 that thou will not leave that would not leave my soul in hail and neither will I suffer thy Holy One to see corruption you see he realized that when he was facing the Giants of that day in the spiritual realm that he realized when he told him you destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it back up again they thought that he was talking about the Temple in Jerusalem but he was talking about this temple and when the angel came to the ladies that were there down there at the tomb remember what he said to you then I'll raise up this temple in three days [Applause] hello if you could realize that's how the Prophet would even tell us about sickness that once that sickness once that spirit is cursed that it goes through a process of dying and when it goes out it dies or when 72-hours corruption sets in he said we're not 72 hours comes in you're going to get sick as all good health and you're going to think that you're not healed but you're already healed you're already delivered but if you can keep your faith through the dying process if you can keep your faith through the dying process you'll come out on the other side alive and well how Satan hates this message because it tells you that you are going to walk before the Lord in the land of the living if Jesus could have that much confidence in the scripture and have that much confidence in the quickening power of Almighty God what about you you're carrying your burden and you think my I'm all by myself you think nobody else knows what I'm going through nobody knows but I've had to put up with this week nobody knows the conversations that I've had this week and you're packing a burden and you're walking around and your shoulders are beginning to hurt because you're carrying this burden all by yourself and you think there's nobody I can give it to if Jesus could have that type of confidence to not only put your burdens on himself but to put your neighbor to put your loved one to put the sins upon him of the whole world and pack that burden and pack that burden on the back of him with an old rugged cross what about you he's not just packing your burden but he's packing the sins of the whole world upon his shoulders and you think you can't make it through if Jesus had confidence in what God said about him what about you tonight what up the confidence to be for us tonight you've heard the greatest message that's ever hit the face of the earth and you still let the devil whip you around show him no mercy tell him I know I came from and no one's going show him no mercy [Applause] stop let that lime that will whip you around God is with me I don't know if you get this tonight if it's processing through your mind but God God is with you sister Connie when you're working on your job and you feel like nobody's around and you feel like I couldn't I'm the only one in my whole entire office do you realize that God is with you how about you brother Evan when you're walking through school and you're you're facing battles it just seems like nobody else knows about but could you realize today that God is with you I love this because it makes it so personal is that he is Emmanuel which being interpreted God God dear to himself come down and dwelt in mortal flesh God with Evan Mays God with Carli God with brother Greg now it's one thing when you walk out and you know that you are going into an absolute battle and it's looking like that the the man that's coming out to battle use a whole lot bigger than you are and he's got a whole bunch of his buddies but if you can look right behind you and somebody whole lot bigger than you but God is with you one time one time in my younger years I won't say exactly win leave out some of the details so mama don't beat me around later tonight but there was one time I was I was be careful here at one time I was I was walking with some friends and and there was a gang of people that started making fun of this girl that was with the crowd and nobody else would stand up I've been taught the whole lot life to stand up to get up I said hold up why don't you talk about somebody else won't you pick on somebody your own size so three guys decided that he's gonna take me on I said I hold on this ain't fair right now they say fairies three gets y'all three all against me I said but let me tell you something if you'll let me have a chance of yet worn out of time I guarantee I'll take you down I said you ain't got a chance you know what I did I said we'll line up right there and I took down all three of them when they gave me the chance because they were picking on a little lady I'm gonna show no mercy on the enemy that is trying to attack God's bride why don't you pick on somebody your own size and Almighty God says I got this I got this this ain't your battle brother Jeff I got this now if I can say that from a humanistically standpoint what about you as a son of God brother Nathaniel when the enemy comes against your family you stand up and say why don't you pick on somebody your own size you ain't picking on me you're picking on God Gloria tells how many God is defending you God is where us Oh God is with us God is with us back when I first met when I first gave my heart to the Lord I was new I was new I was I'd say how they say it sister Connie I was still wet behind here's a little bit and I had had a real conference with God I had met him face to face and I realized that the battle against myself that God had this and I put all my trust in him and God brought me all the way through but I was still green a little bit and didn't have maybe maybe I still ain't got it but I didn't have most senses as some people do I was down here to gas station coming to church I was dressed up kind of like a ham in here tonight I walk in there and this man sitting behind the counter said you hit a church no I'm going to a funeral [Laughter] yeah I'm hit at church and so he's so hot tell you what he said when you go down to a church why don't you light a candle for me I said I tell you what you come up here to church where I'm going here this God that I serve a light your candle he didn't understand you see this is more than lighting a candle but this is about your candle getting live and this is about telling somebody else how your candle got lit and watch the Wildfire begin to spread out oh my you love the Lord the Bible says in Psalms 103 know ye 100 and verse 3 know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that has made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture Deuteronomy 4 and 35 under thee it was showed that thou that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God and there is none else beside him hey I ain't no God beside him there's no God like Jehovah he's the God that is with us and we will see his miracles when Nicodemus came to Jesus secretly at night he said we know that thou master that thou cannot do no man can do these things he cannot do these miracles except he be from God Nicodemus recognized where the miracles were coming from you gotta recognize where the miracles are coming from Almighty God and there's none beside him anybody can say God is good when they're up on the mountain anybody can say God is good when everything's peachy but when the doctor walks in and it tells you some really bad news can he still say God is good when the doctor says you ain't gonna make it can he still say God is good anybody can praise him in the good times but can you praise him in the bad times anybody can praise him when the bills are paid anybody can praise him when he got a new car anybody can praise him when he got new shoes when he got a new house and he got good strength and he got health and he got money he got a good wife but what if you got a bad wife what if you ain't got no money what if he got health can you still say God is good when you ain't got no strengthening weak as a kid can he still say God is good when the shoes you got on you've been wearing for 40 years not by choice can you still say God is good when the car's broke down can you say God is good when the bills ain't being paid can you say God is good can you praise Him in the pally anybody can praise him while they had church but can you praise him out there when you get the enemy toe-to-toe face-to-face can you say my God's bigger than you you stupid devil we as humans we love we love the stories of David we look at the highlights of David's ministry we look at him as he takes down a parent we enjoy those highlights who we enjoy when he talks about killing online and he's more than able to deliver me from the hand of this Philistine we enjoy hearing about how that how the David came back into the city and they began to sing Saul as cute as thousands but Davis tens of thousands we all enjoy those highlights and David's ministry but do you realize that David spent most of his life hiding and running from cover running from his predecessor saw that David spent most of his time camping and he didn't spit it out on the send it out on the Yogi Bear down here and spin it in someplace where he'd get on a roller coaster and get on some waterslide but David camped out in the darkness of a cave in a wet cave walked through valleys walked through the mud and the anointing oil was poured on him everybody looks at the highlights but they miss what may David the king that he was you see sol was a man when he saw somebody rising up in power then he threw spears at him but David could easily he could have easily grabbed those Spears and threw him back it's all he could have easily done that he was a man of war if he'd have done this and got angry got mad he would have ended up exactly like so everybody enjoys David taking off gallant head but can you relate to David down in the mud can you relate to David when he's goal of his army surrounded him and believing in him and he's hiding can you relate to it can you relate to him when he's going through a time of trouble David was not always on the mountaintop praising God David knew some dark times David knew what it was like to feel like nobody was with him David knew what it was alike when parents would walk past him when he was all muddy his clothes ripped apart hidden up to a cave to hide out running from King Saul he knew what it was like for parents to say now if you don't be good you're gonna end up like a giant slayer David knew what it was like to be criticized David knew what it was like to be spit on David wasn't always at a time where he could point I said look look on the end of my spear I got Goliath's head look on the end of my sword I'm dragging it around the city but there was times and David's walk that David felt all alone but David no matter the state or the condition David was in David knew how to praise God David could say in Psalms 27 the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid with no wicked even my enemies and my folks came upon me to eat up my flesh and they stumbled and fail though in host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing if I desired of the Lord that I that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord to enquire in his temple David could say for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle Djali hide me he shall set me upon a rock David never lost his priests come on somebody if anybody's gonna look at symptoms David was looking at symptoms look back at what Samuel did he poured the anointing on top of me I didn't immediately take kingship but I went back to hurt and sheep I went back I wish to run around but David no matter him no matter what he was he believed what the prophet Samuel had said about him that he was the oncoming king and David said in Psalm 34 that I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth Psalm 71 and 8 let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honor all the day sums 145 I will extol thee my god o King and I will bless thy name forever and ever every day will I bless thee I will praise thy name forever and ever can you praise him when you don't feeling can you praise him when you don't sin can you praise him when you're all alone come on somebody can you praise him when he just got done putting a roof on your house anything leaks can you still lift up your hands and say thank you Lord now I know I ain't got you on your feet but if you can realize that you can get through these moments if you can get through the valley of the shadow of death and realize that the enemy can touch one hair of your head and you can still say God who is with me do you realize that you're not only motions like that you're not going on site right there you're not going on feeling right there you're speaking from a realm of faith that God is with me through the fire I say at 24 and 14 they shall lift up their voice they shall sing for the majesty of the Lord they shall cry aloud from the sea write this one down verse 15 where I glorify you the Lord in the fires glorify even the name of the Lord of the God of Israel in the aisles of a sea glorify the god in your afflictions glorify the Almighty God in tribulation in valleys in Louis States in conditions in holes in dens in cliffs in rocks when the persecuting enemy is chasing you down glorify the Lord he's called in the Bible Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Jireh means the Lord will provide I'm so glad tonight to know that he's still Jehovah Jireh no matter what the circumstance he is God will make a way a way of escape Satan may pin you in a corner with a cancer God will make a way of escape Satan may pin you down under a car God will make a way of escape Satan may take your family away from you but God will make a way of escape God has away for gospel right house do you trust away he's not part of the way he is the way the truth the life my closing statements I want to give you a song of deliverance God is with me second Sandino 22 in warning I want you to look at your neighbor say God is with me we will see miracles America is something that you can't explain it's a miracle that America is something that you can't figure out America is a paradox unbelievable but true and if you're born again every believer is a paradox and unless you have that born-again experience you cannot be a Christian you're not called a paradox unless you've had those moments but he's not offered us a floury bit of ease God don't promise easy things God promises impossible things impossible for you but possible for him you can't have a miracle unless you have an extremely hard circumstance you see when you're asking for a miracle you're realizing that you're between a rock and a hard place and you need to sing this song and David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all of his enemies and out of the hand of Saul he didn't wait to sing it he didn't wait till he felt like singing it he sang it the day I want you to sing this song today let this be your song of deliverance this day may you say it like this this day this scripture is fulfilled this day this song will be sung out of my soul this day this is my song of deliverance are you ready to sing and he said the Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer the God of my rock in him when I trust he is my shield in the horn of my salvation my high tower my refuge my Saviour they'll save us me from violence I will call on the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from our enemies when the waves of death compassed me the floods of ungodly men made me afraid The Sorrows of Hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me in my distress what a song I called upon the Lord and cried to my god and he did hear my voice out of his temple and my cry did enter into his ears verse 28 and the afflicted people thou will save and the afflicted people the afflicted people not the whole people but the people that are in health but the people that are afflicted this sounds like a people that needed a miracle this sounded like a people that were up against the wall and the afflicted people now we're safe but thine eyes upon the Holte that thou may us bring them down for thou art my landlord and the Lord will lighten my darkness for Bobby have I run through a troop by my god have I leaped over a wall that's for God his way is perfect the way of the Lord is tried he is a buckler to all them that trust in him for who is God said the Lord and who is a rock save our God God is my strength and power he maketh my way Perkin perfect he maketh my feet like Hinds feet and setteth me upon the high places he teaches my hands the war so that a bowl of steel is broken by mine arms thou has also given me the shield of our salvation and not gentleness has made me great thou hast enlarged my steps under me so that my feet did not slip I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them and turned not again until I had consumed them if you could ever get in your mind that your enemies are God's enemies you can sing a song from a totally different standpoint if you realize that the battle that you're facing is God's battle that your enemy is God's enemy you can chase them down you're not standing alone one who put a flight a thousand to ten thousand I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them and turn not again until I had consumed them right now you got your enemy on the run it's your choice whether you want to give up halfway through your miracle it's your choice whether you want to give in and throw in the towel it's your choice whether you go after them they're running from you but will you pursue them will the people of the miracle go after them run after them pursue them and consume them Bible said that Jesus came and it was manifested to destroy the works of the devil but the Prophet said that you are here you were born to destroy the works of the devil and his bodies to do the same you're to do the same thing that he did you're here to carry out the threats you're here to carry out the victory you're a Church of the word born of the word a virgin born from the word you're a body that operates by headship a headship that's over top of all of your enemies but will you back up you've got a choice to whether continue to seek keep singing or go sit down in your pew but if you felt like I felt you'd be shouting to [Applause] verse 39 he'll hate and I have consumed them and wounded them that they could not arise yet yay they are falling under this is not a song of deliverance for your brother for your sister but it's for you the enemy is falling under my feet for thou hast girded me with strength to the battle then that rose up against me has thou subdued under me in your hour of trouble he hath girded you with strength to win the battle the battle is not mine the battle is the Lord's he's going to give you strength to sing this song he's not willing that any should perish he's not willing that anybody would go halfway but you'd go all the way you were put here to finish this race sister Amazon track that she's running and her coach told her her coach told her when he don't feel like running run for those that can't run because there's a lot of people that love to make these two legs walk they'd love to make them run honey so when you don't feel like running run for them that can't run there's some people in your walk right now that can't do it but why don't you run for them you got a coach on your side that is telling you that Satan didn't make you so Satan can't break you there's a copse on the inside of you that's telling you that Satan didn't start you so Satan can't finish you I want you to run for every believer that's here on this earth I want you to rise up and I want you to walk in the land of the lift there might be a brother that's fallen there might be a sister that's fallen but let's run this race let us run for those that can't run let us carry will you choose well you choose to sing will you choose to sing a song and delivers when it looks like you're still bound will you choose to sing and praise him when it seems like oh hope is gone will you still choose to sing a song with deliverance that God is bringing me out he made away from me Satan's tried to put me in a corner and I'm gonna sing it has been a vision that said that it's coming as been a vision said that it's coming but I'd say that if you talk to brother Jeffery and sister Ana there's been times when they crocked I'd say there's times when they didn't understand there's been times when neighborhood maybe it's not for us but when God says but when God says I'm gonna give you a baby you see because the vision has got to come to pass the vision has been made plain and Road out you can run hallelujah the visions been made plain you can run with it Church I want you to know that you were seen in the rapture you can run you can face the battle with everything that's within you because you are seen they are shouting and your offspring with you give God praise in a house of God I can stand this test because God is with me I can pace the tears because God is with me let the musicians come but do you choose do you choose the worship to the pain do you choose the worship do you choose the worship when all hope is gone it's easy to believe right now it's easy for you to say I'm going to praise it but when every devil in him is running at you with everything that's within them because they know that you are going to win they know that and Satan is afraid because he knows that you are getting ready to slip out of his grips and he can hold you no longer can you still praise him through that pain I'm talking about now anybody can praise him anybody can praise him when they got food on the table anybody can praise them when everything's just going just right here I'd say ho praise God that's good today cuz everything's just right but worship is or the totally different level anybody can say god is good when they don't look like God is good but worship comes from the heart worship is when you ain't got shoes on your feet and you still say God is good worship is showing you have got cancer staring you down and it still comes out of you that my god he's a known time God he's a healer he's a wave maker pants are standing down but worship comes out of you worship comes out of you he's the Lord that God that heals all about a ceaseless forget not as benefits that's worth so that's real true worship I will praise you in this storm and I will lift my hand no matter where you are no matter where I am I will praise you I will praise you in this storm I remind you surrender no no our king is with us start singing brother Matthew right now right now I want you to determine that you're going to show no mercy yeah want you to pray I don't want you to pray from a spot of defeat I want you to pray from a spot of victory I want you to pray like war is open on hell because it is you see a lot of people can pray and they could talk words into the atmosphere but when you pray do you know who you're praying to you're talking to the creator of the universe I want you to show no mercy on him and I want you to pray things out of your lips I want you to prophesize things out of your lips because you're the bride of Jesus Christ and you have thus saith the Lord go take this book heat this book and prophesy again son of man I want you to let loose out of your prayer out of your chambers a prayer I want you to letter I don't want you just talking to God I want you to worship you see anybody can when they're standing here you're not going to pray the same way that you pray when you're in your closet but if you can ever learn to pray no matter who's around you I'm not talking about just saying some words but I'm talking about prayer when you say God that seems there is no way I know God I know God that you're going to make away you promised me that you are with me you see it's not about you just talking to God but let God talk back to you start echoing things out of your soul you start building things out you start speaking into another round I [Music] don't know why it keeps coming to me but I'm home what you tell I want to tell you this carry your burden no more [Music] carry your burden no more [Music] this is how I find my benadryl hisses how if I mind this is how I find my burgers
