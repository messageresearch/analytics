[28:53] water?
[28:54] Mary, did you know
[28:57] that your baby boy would save our sons
[29:03] and daughterers?
[29:05] Did you know
[29:08] that your baby boy has come to make you
[29:13] new?
[29:16] And this child that you delivered
[29:21] will soon deliver you.
[29:26] Mary, did you know
[29:28] that your baby boy will give sight to a
[29:34] blind man? Mary, did you know
[29:39] that your baby boy would calm a storm
[29:45] with his hands? Did you know
[29:50] that your baby boy has walked where
[29:55] angels try?
[29:58] And when you kiss your little baby,
[30:03] you've kissed the face of God. Oh Mary,
[30:10] you know
[30:29] The blind will see, the death will hear,
[30:34] the dead will live again.
[30:39] The lame will leave, the dumb will speak
[30:44] the praisees of the lamb.
[30:52] Mary, did you know
[30:55] that your baby boy is Lord of all
[31:01] creation?
[31:03] Mary, did you know
[31:06] that your baby boy will one day rule the
[31:12] nations?
[31:14] Did you know
[31:17] that your baby boy is heaven's perfect
[31:23] lamb
[31:25] and this sleeping child you're holding
[31:31] is the great
[31:34] I
[31:37] Yeah.
[31:56] Oh, Mary,
[31:58] did you know
[32:56] won't be discouraged.
[32:59] Even when I'm discouraged,
[33:03] I'll remind my soul of all you've done
[33:07] before.
[33:10] I won't be distracted
[33:13] even in the distraction.
[33:16] I will trust the one who is greater than
[33:20] the storm.
[33:23] I will trust the one who is greater than
[33:27] the stor.
[33:32] I don't need another reason.
[33:35] I don't need more convincing.
[33:39] The same God who made a way is the same
[33:43] God who's here today. Even in my darkest
[33:48] moment,
[33:50] this will be the truth I'm holding.
[33:53] It's the same God who made a way. It's
[33:57] the same God who's here today.
[34:13] I will be shen
[34:16] even when I'm shaking.
[34:20] Having done all I can do, I still will
[34:24] stand.
[34:27] And I will worship,
[34:30] Lord. I worship.
[34:34] I will face whatever comes with lifted
[34:38] hands.
[34:43] And I don't need another reason.
[34:46] I don't need more convincing.
[34:50] The same God who made a way is the same
[34:54] God who's here today. Even in my darkest
[34:59] moment,
[35:00] this will be the truth I'm holding.
[35:04] The same God who made a way is the same
[35:08] God who's here today.
[35:18] If you're not done,
[35:22] then I'm not done waiting.
[35:26] If you're not done working,
[35:29] then I'm not done praising.
[35:33] If you're not done moving,
[35:36] then I'm not done waiting.
[35:40] And if you're not done working,
[35:43] then I'm not done praising.
[35:47] I believe you're moving,
[35:50] so I'm not done waiting.
[35:54] I believe you're working,
[35:57] so I'm not done praising.
[36:04] Oh,
[36:07] I don't need another reason.
[36:11] I don't need more convincing.
[36:14] The same God who made a way is the same
[36:18] God who's here today. Even in my darkest
[36:23] moment,
[36:25] this will be the truth I'm holding. And
[36:28] the same God who made a way is the same
[36:32] God who's here. There is no one higher,
[36:37] no one greater, no one like our God.
[36:42] There is none more able. Christ our
[36:45] savior, great and glorious.
[36:49] There is no one higher, no one greater,
[36:53] no one like our God. There is none more
[36:58] able. Christ our savior, great and
[37:01] glorious.
[37:03] There is no one higher, no one greater,
[37:07] no one like our God. There is none more
[37:12] able. Christ our savior. Great and
[37:15] glorious.
[37:25] I don't need another reason.
[37:29] I don't need more convincing.
[37:32] The same God who made a way is the same
[37:37] God who's here today. Even in my darkest
[37:41] moment,
[37:43] this will be the truth I'm holding.
[37:47] The same God who made a way is the same
[37:51] God who's here today.
[38:01] The same God who made a way is the same
[38:06] God who's here today.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:22] Is it the same God?
[38:24] Are you a witness to that?
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand this afternoon and as
[38:28] we get ready to change order of the
[38:29] service and invite our brother David
[38:32] Mayor to come and share what the Lord
[38:34] has laid upon his heart. Key of A

[40:40] our
[40:48] God's fullness.
[40:57] You go deep.
[41:02] I'd say it like granddaddy Homer say, "I
[41:04] can't sing it. I'm a little bit horse."
[41:05] And he never was horse, but I actually
[41:10] What kind?
[41:18] Oh, bringing us

[42:48] Oh the great
[42:51] creator.
[42:57] He became
[42:59] my savior

[45:08] He became
[45:10] my savior
[45:16] and all
[45:19] the fullness
[45:24] dwell
[45:27] in him. Can we sing that once again with
[45:30] all our hearts? Oh, how I love him. Oh,
[45:34] how
[45:36] I love
[45:41] How I
[45:44] adore
[45:50] my breath,
[45:52] my sunshine.
[45:58] Oh, you're my all
[46:01] in all.
[46:06] Oh, the great
[46:09] creator
[46:15] became
[46:17] my savior
[46:23] and all
[46:26] God's fullness
[46:32] dwell
[46:35] in him.
[46:38] Hallelujah. Can we give him praise?
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I love him.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; If tonight there's one I want to brag
[46:52] about, it's my Lord and Savior.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ,
[46:58] &gt;&gt; and he is worthy of all our praise.
[47:01] Amen. May God richly bless you. It's a
[47:04] great honor for me to be here again in
[47:08] this family reunion.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; And the church says, "Amen."
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there where the spirit of the
[47:15] Lord is, there is liberty.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; So maybe some have never seen me, but
[47:20] that's just you have spiritual amnesia
[47:25] because we were together.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; We were together.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Not here before the foundation of the
[47:31] world.
[47:33] Amen. And it's a great honor to be
[47:35] standing. You know the the the prophet,
[47:37] he says there are churches, churches.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; You can preach with me.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Brides, brides.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Churches, brides, brides.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; But there has got to come one.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. He says there has to
[47:56] come a real bride.
[47:58] Amen. There must come one.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; So there's not many many bride. There's
[48:03] one bride.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Made out of many members.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; And I'm a I'm one of them.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[48:11] them.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; There's one bride. Amen. That not only
[48:15] has the mechanics,
[48:17] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT HAS THE DYNAMICS on the
[48:19] mechanics.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That makes the church live.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. SO, WE DON'T SERVE A DEAD GOD.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; We serve a living God. Amen.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; The word is alive
[48:32] &gt;&gt; and it's a great honor to be standing
[48:35] before a portion of that one.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I bring you greetings on
[48:41] behalf of the church back home and my
[48:44] wife. I'm very honored and blessed to
[48:47] have my wife with me, Sister Anne, my
[48:49] oldest daughter, Jessica, and God bless
[48:51] them. It's always better to travel
[48:54] together. Amen. the the pastors, the
[48:57] ministers know that. So they we bring
[49:00] greetings and I want to personally thank
[49:03] you. Amen. Because through the years
[49:08] you have had so much love towards us.
[49:11] You're going to say, "Well, brother
[49:12] David, how?" Because you let your
[49:14] pastor, Brother Ron,
[49:17] travel overseas to be a blessing for
[49:20] that portion of the bride over there.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I personally with all my heart
[49:25] want to thank you because I know we want
[49:27] to keep our pastor. We love him so much.
[49:29] We want to have him here and when he's
[49:31] gone, uh, you know,
[49:34] but we're not selfish people.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; We're Christians. How many Christians do
[49:38] we have tonight?
[49:40] &gt;&gt; That means to be like Christ and to live
[49:42] for others.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; So, amen. From the depths of my heart, I
[49:47] say thank you on behalf of the European
[49:50] bride are we are blessed to have true
[49:54] servants of God that stand for the pure
[49:57] word of God. So, thank you for sharing,
[49:59] brother Ron, brother Andrew.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and we're just, you know,
[50:04] we're preparing the bride because
[50:07] there's a five-fold ministry, says the
[50:09] word.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:11] for the perfecting of the saints.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; So, we truly want to give glory to God
[50:19] for the vessel that God is using. Amen.
[50:22] And we surely love Brother Ron with all
[50:24] our heart. Sister Connie, thank you for
[50:27] all you've done for us through the
[50:28] years. So I was so blessed when when
[50:31] when with brother Andrew when we we we
[50:33] we made this we started organizing this
[50:38] and you know brother Ron so there were
[50:40] some tight moments
[50:43] but then when I opened the door and we
[50:45] could see and surprise brother Ron we
[50:48] really say thank you Jesus amen we were
[50:53] praying please don't reveal that to
[50:54] brother Ron please don't reveal it
[50:58] and the Lord answers prayer
[51:01] and the church says amen.
[51:04] Amen. So, it's a great honor to be here.
[51:07] Amen. And we're under great expectation.
[51:10] I'm a nobody. Amen. I truly say that
[51:13] with all my heart. I'm a sinner saved by
[51:15] God's grace. Amen. And I just want to
[51:18] tell about somebody.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That can save anybody.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; And his name is Jesus Christ.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; So that's the doctrine I will preach
[51:27] tonight. Is that okay?
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if I can ask you one thing, you
[51:31] preach with me.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you know there's a fire of
[51:37] God burning. So there there's no cold.
[51:39] There's no ice.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; It's the power of God that is moving.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; And whatever your need is, I know the
[51:46] Lord directed me one way. So I said,
[51:48] "Lord, you know, we as as pastors, as
[51:51] ministers, we don't necessarily like it
[51:52] when God changes our plans. But then we
[51:55] say, Lord, it's up to you now. So, may
[51:57] God have his way tonight. Amen. And like
[52:00] the prophet would say before we read the
[52:02] word, he says, "What we need is a Holy
[52:04] Ghost atmosphere."
[52:06] &gt;&gt; He says, "That's right. An atmosphere
[52:07] where the power of God is moving, where
[52:10] we're in one accord, one place, gathered
[52:12] together under the atmosphere of
[52:15] expecting God to move down and do signs
[52:19] and wonders."
[52:22] &gt;&gt; How many have that desire tonight?
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You didn't know brother David was
[52:27] going to preach. Well, maybe you prefer
[52:29] brother Andrew. And I understand. Me,
[52:31] too. I prefer brother Andrew,
[52:34] but it fell on me. But we still say
[52:37] serve the same God.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; He can use different vocal cords, but we
[52:41] serve a living God.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, the prophet, let's
[52:45] move ourselves up into that bracket.
[52:48] Step up in faith. move out of these
[52:51] three dimensions
[52:53] up into the next one. So, let's lay
[52:56] everything aside. No matter how you how
[52:58] good or how bad your day was, how good,
[53:01] how bad your week was, LAY ASIDE
[53:03] EVERYTHING. This is the most important
[53:05] MOMENT WHEN WE COME IN THE PRESENCE OF
[53:08] THE ALMIGHTY God
[53:10] &gt;&gt; because he knows more about you than
[53:13] what we know about us.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; So, let's put aside this three
[53:19] dimension. and let's go in
[53:21] &gt;&gt; the other brackets. Amen. So, let's open
[53:24] up the word in Ephesians.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 6
[53:38] going to start from verse 10.
[53:48] You can say amen when you're there.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Finally, my brethren,
[53:56] be strong in the Lord. Doesn't say be
[54:00] strong in your own strength.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; And the sister says, "Well, it's only
[54:06] the brethren."
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Be strong in the Lord.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; From the youngest to the oldest. Amen.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Because there's no Greek, there's no
[54:21] Jew, there's no man, there's no woman.
[54:23] We are one.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; So be strong in the Lord
[54:28] &gt;&gt; and in the power of his might. Put on
[54:31] the whole armor of God that ye may be
[54:34] able to stand against the viles of the
[54:36] devil. For we wrestle not against flesh
[54:39] and blood, but against principalities,
[54:41] against powers, against the rulers of
[54:44] the darkness of this world, against
[54:46] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[54:48] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[54:51] of God, that ye may be able to withstand
[54:53] in the evil day, and having done all to
[54:56] stand, stand therefore.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:02] one first John
[55:05] 4 got three scriptures
[55:08] and then many more how the Lord will
[55:10] lead
[55:11] first John
[55:15] 4 4:4
[55:20] I love that verse
[55:25] &gt;&gt; ye are of God
[55:29] &gt;&gt; that ought the pope if he had a
[55:31] revelation
[55:32] That's right.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Of what this verse, little verse says,
[55:36] that ought to make him shout. Now, what?
[55:40] &gt;&gt; What about the bride?
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Ye are of God,
[55:48] &gt;&gt; brother David. Who do you think you are?
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. God came down in our generation
[55:54] &gt;&gt; to reveal himself,
[55:56] &gt;&gt; who we were, what our true identity is.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So ye are of God, little children,
[56:03] and have overcome them. Why? Because
[56:06] greater is he that is in you
[56:09] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, hallelujah. And Ephesians
[56:16] 1, we'll start with verse three.
[56:34] Blessed be the God and Father of our
[56:37] Lord Jesus Christ, who had blessed us
[56:40] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[56:43] places in Christ, according as he had
[56:46] chosen us in him before the foundation
[56:49] of the world, that we should be holy
[56:52] without blame before him in love, having
[56:54] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[56:57] children by Jesus Christ to himself,
[57:00] according to the good pleasure of his
[57:02] will, to the praise of the glory of his
[57:05] grace, wherein he had made us accepted
[57:09] in the beloved.
[57:11] May God add the blessing to the reading
[57:13] of his word. Let's bow our heads for a
[57:16] word of prayer. Our dear heavenly
[57:19] father,
[57:21] Lord, we count it such a great honor and
[57:23] a privilege and we never want to take it
[57:26] for granted Lord to be standing on holy
[57:29] ground Lord to know Father there where
[57:32] two or three are gathered in your name
[57:34] you are there father Lord. So tonight
[57:37] Lord God as we have gathered here Lord
[57:40] we have many needs but Lord you know
[57:42] everything about us. So I pray Lord God
[57:45] as we have read your word. May you come
[57:47] down and break the bread of life to us
[57:49] Father. May it Lord not just be word
[57:52] that we hear Father. May you anoint our
[57:54] spiritual ears Lord God so that we can
[57:57] hear Lord what you say to us Father. And
[58:00] Lord may we have a greater love even for
[58:02] you Lord. And uh may we have this
[58:05] fellowship with you Lord that you love
[58:07] when you were in the Garden of Eden. You
[58:09] love to fellowship with Adam and Eve.
[58:12] And father, even tonight, you want to
[58:14] have fellowship with us. So Lord, as we
[58:17] surrender to you, I pray, Father, may
[58:19] you speak through the vessel. Lord God,
[58:21] you know your people, Father. So have
[58:23] your way. We pray and ask these things
[58:25] in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus
[58:28] Christ. And the church says,
[58:30] &gt;&gt; "Amen and amen." You may be seated.
[58:35] Thank you, bro.
[58:40] Amen. So we read in Ephesians 1 is
[58:43] blessed with all spiritual blessings in
[58:45] heavenly places. Amen. So we have to get
[58:48] out of these three dimensions into that
[58:51] bracket where we're in heavenly places.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. So we need to create that
[58:56] atmosphere and it's not up to the
[58:58] pastor, the minister who's preaching
[59:00] each and everyone. Amen. We create that
[59:03] atmosphere around us. Amen. Even if
[59:06] there's an unbeliever sitting next to
[59:08] us, there's such a presence of God.
[59:10] Amen. THAT EVEN MAKES THE THE VILEST
[59:13] SINNER CLEAN.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; WHY? Because the atmosphere we create.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I I read the statement the
[59:23] other day and and and it it drove my
[59:25] attention. Amen. And it says that a cat
[59:28] that dreams of becoming a lion, are you
[59:32] with me?
[59:34] must lose its appetite for rats.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; So now chickens in the in the barnyard,
[59:43] they like to, you know, clock and and
[59:46] and then but we are the eagles.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; So it's ABOUT TIME WE STOP EATING, you
[59:52] know, the the little little No, no, WE
[59:55] HAVE AN OPEN BOOK THAT WAS GIVEN to us.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE HAVE A A REAL STEAK, A GOOD
[1:00:00] STEAK.
[1:00:04] AMEN. THIS opening of the word is not
[1:00:07] SKIM MILK. AMEN. SOME PEOPLE DON'T
[1:00:09] DIGEST IT, BUT I LOVE IT.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; I LOVE THE REVEALED WORD. Satan hates
[1:00:16] Genesis and Revelation, BUT I LOVE IT.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE, THE EAGLES, they love it.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, my title tonight, Amen, is the
[1:00:27] unstoppable seed of God.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? The unstoppable
[1:00:34] seed of God,
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; all is well.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Brother David, you don't you don't know
[1:00:44] my my problems.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; All is well.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Is it okay I preach tonight?
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. All is well. Oh, you know no, you
[1:00:54] don't know the GOD WE SERVE.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BROTHER HANNAH WAS GOING IN. HE
[1:01:00] THE ONE HE HOLDS THE UNIVERSE. THE ONE
[1:01:02] HE HOLDS. AMEN. EVERYTHING ABOUT US. HE
[1:01:06] KNOWS EVERY He knows my heartbeat.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; My red blood cells, my white blood
[1:01:12] cells, how many hairs? COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; WHAT A MIGHTY GOD WE SERVE.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO THE UNSTOPPABLE SEED OF GOD,
[1:01:22] ALL is well.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet says, "The seed,
[1:01:28] thy seed shall possess the gates of THE
[1:01:30] ENEMY." REMEMBER THAT'S THUS SAYETH THE
[1:01:34] LORD,
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Abraham's seed believes that.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; You never should be ashamed to say,
[1:01:41] "Amen."
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; I know there's always a little barrier.
[1:01:47] Brother David has a little accent. Don't
[1:01:49] you worry.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Don't you worry about that.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; I preach the word. Nothing that but the
[1:01:54] word of God.
[1:01:56] Amen. So, we're afraid to say amen
[1:01:58] because I might wake up my or I MIGHT
[1:02:00] SHAKE SOME. NO, NO. AMEN. THE MORE I
[1:02:03] WATER the word of God, THE MORE THE SEED
[1:02:06] OF GOD will grow and
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; and will what will make me act according
[1:02:13] to the word.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; So, don't you be afraid of saying amen.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; I love to say amen. I love to say
[1:02:22] hallelujah.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; You know why? because God loves it.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So he says Abraham's seed
[1:02:30] believes that. And if you are a genuine
[1:02:32] seed of Abraham, the faith that Abraham
[1:02:35] had in God is in you.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY GOD IN OUR generation came
[1:02:45] down to open the seals thereof. Amen. To
[1:02:48] give us what? 99% faith. How faith? No.
[1:02:53] Perfect faith.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; THE FAITH THAT ABRAHAM HAD IN GOD IS IN
[1:02:58] YOU.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; AND YOU BELIEVE THAT WHAT GOD HAS SAID,
[1:03:04] GOD keeps his promises.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; So what can you say against that? Satan.
[1:03:15] Boo.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; And I quote it many times your pastor on
[1:03:19] that. Boo devil.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Boo. Amen. So tonight, Amen. The prophet
[1:03:24] says the Holy Spirit through the word is
[1:03:27] bringing you the good news. I'm bringing
[1:03:29] you good tidings of great joy.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Great joy means WE CAN REJOICE
[1:03:36] TONIGHT. LET US BE GLAD AND REJOICE.
[1:03:39] AMEN. OH, have you ever seen a Christmas
[1:03:43] Oh, I'm against Christmas celebrations.
[1:03:45] Forget it.
[1:03:47] Christ was born.
[1:03:52] THE ANGELS CAME DOWN. I BRING YOU GOOD
[1:03:55] NEWS. MY SAVIOR, MY REDEEMER IS ON EARTH
[1:04:01] TO TAKE MY PLACE.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TREE. I'M NOT
[1:04:08] TALKING ABOUT THE DECORATION. THE REAL
[1:04:10] CHRISTMAS IS CHRIST IN ME
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; BORN.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; GLORY. GLORY. AMEN. AMEN. So the tonight
[1:04:20] the Holy Spirit THROUGH THE WORD IS
[1:04:22] BRINGING YOU THE GOOD NEWS THAT BEFORE
[1:04:24] THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORD, GOD WROTE
[1:04:27] YOUR NAME.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; THERE ARE SOME HERE TONIGHT THAT DON'T
[1:04:31] EVEN CAN WRITE THEIR NAME.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Do we have any babies? They're in the in
[1:04:36] the children room anyway.
[1:04:40] They cannot write their name. But God
[1:04:42] wrote their name.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Come on now. AMEN. IN LAMB'S BOOK OF
[1:04:48] LIFE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD
[1:04:51] AND ALL THE DEVILS OF HELL.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. CAN'T ERASE YOUR NAME.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; God wrote it and SPOKE IT AND IT'S JUST
[1:05:05] AS SURE TO HAPPEN as God WROTE IT IN
[1:05:07] THERE BEFORE the foundation of the
[1:05:09] world.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; He chose you.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; He chose us.
[1:05:20] so that we can be strong in him.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; You never chose him and he brought YOU
[1:05:27] INTO CHRIST AND YOU ARE secure with
[1:05:30] Jesus Christ.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; The only safety is in him.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can have the biggest
[1:05:36] assurance.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:41] Oh, I'm insured for
[1:05:44] $50 million.
[1:05:46] That's peanuts.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; The only assurance IS IN JESUS CHRIST.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; FROM THE YOUNGEST TO THE OLDEST.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, LET'S NOT WASTE OUR TIME
[1:06:01] TONIGHT. WE HAVE ONE MORE OPPORTUNITY.
[1:06:03] AMEN. TO COME TO CHRIST, TO GIVE OUR
[1:06:06] LIVES, TO SURRENDER. AMEN. AND AS A
[1:06:09] CHRISTIAN, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ALWAYS WANT
[1:06:12] MORE OF GOD.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; He brought you into Christ and you are
[1:06:21] secure with Jesus Christ. And now
[1:06:23] listen,
[1:06:25] that's just to destroy Satan. Okay.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; AND JUST AS PERFECT AS CHRIST WAS BEFORE
[1:06:32] GOD.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; SORRY, HONEY, but my wife, she doesn't
[1:06:39] see me perfect.
[1:06:44] She didn't say amen to that.
[1:06:47] Even though she thinks I'm the best.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SEES US PERFECT.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; COME ON, STOP LOOKING THROUGH YOUR EYES.
[1:07:02] LET'S LOOK WITH THE WITH OUR EYES OF
[1:07:04] FAITH WHAT THE WORD WHAT GOD SAYS ABOUT
[1:07:07] ME, ABOUT US.
[1:07:09] GOD SEES JUST AS PERFECT AS CHRIST WAS
[1:07:12] BEFORE GOD. FOR YOU'RE NOT STANDING WITH
[1:07:14] YOUR OWN. YOU'RE STANDING IN HIM WITH
[1:07:17] ONE THING.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; WITH ONE THING.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT WITH A LIST. WITH ONE THING. I
[1:07:24] BELIEVE GOD.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; WOO. Is it that simple? YES. IF THOU
[1:07:30] CANST BELIEVE. AMEN. ONLY BELIEVE ALL
[1:07:34] THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. PEOPLE, AMEN, that are
[1:07:40] afraid to take God at its word. I've
[1:07:43] tried, I'VE PRAYED, I'VE PRAYED, I'VE
[1:07:45] FASTED, I've prayed, I'VE BEEN IN PRAYER
[1:07:47] LINES. AMEN. WELL, TONIGHT YOU HAVE
[1:07:49] ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; TONIGHT, YOU HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT, A
[1:07:53] MEETING WITH GOD.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; THIS IS OUR TIME.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. The only thing is I believe
[1:08:01] God. Isn't that something? Amen. And
[1:08:04] that we can say that I believe God.
[1:08:07] Hallelujah. So now, amen. The prophet
[1:08:10] says, "And God's only provided a place
[1:08:12] of worship. He had in his heart before
[1:08:14] the foundation of the world a son
[1:08:17] because he is a father." So in him there
[1:08:19] were attributes. Amen. And it was still,
[1:08:23] listen how he says it, it was still in
[1:08:26] the genes of his word. Right?
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; And he created a man and he had to put
[1:08:33] him on a free moral agency. But that man
[1:08:36] fell. But the great sculpture,
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; God who made man from the dust of the
[1:08:43] earth, he didn't settle for that.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; So, oh, don't you tell me, Amen. God has
[1:08:51] abandoned me or God is no. As long as
[1:08:55] he's working on MY CLAY, I SAY, "THANK
[1:08:57] YOU, LORD JESUS." BECAUSE THAT MEANS HE
[1:09:00] DIDN'T THROW THE CLAY AWAY BECAUSE HE
[1:09:02] SEES THE VALUE IN YOU.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SATAN TELLS YOU YOU'RE USELESS.
[1:09:07] SATAN TELLS YOU YOU'RE WORTHLESS. BUT
[1:09:09] GOD SAYS YOU ARE WORTHY. THAT'S WHY I
[1:09:12] GAVE MY LIFE TO YOU.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. God who made man from the dust of
[1:09:19] earth, he didn't settle for that. He
[1:09:20] started making man again. Yes.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Now, you want to know, let me give you
[1:09:25] that definition of a gene. Now, don't
[1:09:27] think I'm I'm I'm very intelligent. I'm
[1:09:29] not. I'm a simple believer.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't think because I'm from
[1:09:40] Switzerland, live in France, originally
[1:09:42] from Belgium, but really originally from
[1:09:45] God.
[1:09:53] Listen now. The definition of a gene is
[1:09:55] a heredity unit controlling a particular
[1:09:58] character.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; This genetic element corresponds to a
[1:10:03] segment of DNA or RNA located at a
[1:10:07] specific location, a locus on a
[1:10:09] chromosome. Now you young young I know
[1:10:12] it sounds like Chinese for me the same.
[1:10:14] I know
[1:10:17] each region of the DNA that produces a
[1:10:20] functional RNA molecule is a gene.
[1:10:24] Now the nucleus, those are all big
[1:10:26] words, but I'm I'm getting to a point
[1:10:29] here. The nucleus of the cell is the
[1:10:32] library
[1:10:35] which contains all the heredary heritage
[1:10:39] of the individual. And the chromosome is
[1:10:42] a book of this library. And the gene
[1:10:48] is one page of the book.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Now you want to talk about my gene. My
[1:10:56] spiritual gene that was in God before
[1:10:58] the foundation of the world. Amen. My
[1:11:00] name was written on this page.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wrote my name in the book.
[1:11:06] Amen. He wrote your name in the book.
[1:11:08] Amen. He sealed the book with seven
[1:11:10] seals. Amen. But he CAME DOWN IN MY
[1:11:12] generation to MAKE SURE IN MY AGE THAT I
[1:11:16] CAN SEE MY NAME IN THE BOOK THAT I CAN
[1:11:18] SEE. AMEN. I AM A GENE SEED FROM GOD.
[1:11:22] THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAYS THE GENE
[1:11:24] SEED FOUND YOU.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. HE FOUND ME.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TO GOD BE THE GLORY. AMEN.
[1:11:34] AMEN. AMEN. Isn't he worthy of our
[1:11:36] praise? Amen. So now could you imagine?
[1:11:40] Amen. God he loves. Amen. He talks about
[1:11:43] the great sculpture. Amen. And there's a
[1:11:45] story that goes, you all heard about
[1:11:48] Michelangelo.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; He just has the gift that God gave him.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Now he we know he's he he sculpted
[1:12:02] Moses. Amen. How it was an inspiration
[1:12:05] to the prophet. He also sculpted David.
[1:12:07] the statue of David. Amen. But there's a
[1:12:10] story behind there. Let me give you that
[1:12:12] story.
[1:12:13] Amen. There was a big piece of marble
[1:12:16] and that marble was originally cut for
[1:12:19] work before even Michelangelo was born.
[1:12:23] So in fact, it was commissioned to
[1:12:25] Agugustino Duchio in 1464. It's not a
[1:12:29] history class, huh? Just making a point
[1:12:32] here.
[1:12:33] 11 years before Michelangelo would come
[1:12:36] into this world. Eventually, Agiston
[1:12:38] could not decide what to do with it. So,
[1:12:41] he gave up the commission then, Amen. in
[1:12:44] 1476 when Michelangelo was just one year
[1:12:47] old. ANOTHER artist by the name of
[1:12:50] Antonio Rosolini, sorry, was
[1:12:53] commissioned to work with the marble.
[1:12:55] And as with Agugustino, he could not see
[1:12:59] what the marble could become.
[1:13:06] Come on now, saints.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; You know, I'm I'm going somewhere here.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Even Leonardo da Vinci WAS ASKED TO
[1:13:17] CONSIDER working the marble and he
[1:13:19] declined for two reasons. First, he
[1:13:22] thought sculpting sculpting was a low
[1:13:24] form of art and he was arrogant in that
[1:13:27] way. Brilliant but arrogant. The old man
[1:13:30] rolled his eyes as if disgusted. Second,
[1:13:33] he took he he too could not see what the
[1:13:36] marble could become. So, three artists,
[1:13:39] famous artists,
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; one of them of the most famous ever came
[1:13:47] before Michelangelo and could not see
[1:13:49] what the marble held deep inside.
[1:13:54] But Michelangelo,
[1:13:56] he saw the angel deep at rest within the
[1:13:59] rock, WAITING TO BE SET FREE.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; SATAN TELLS US YOU'RE WORTHLESS.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL NEVER MAKE IT.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THIS PIECE OF CLAY WALKING ON
[1:14:15] THIS EARTH IN THIS AGE OF LOUD?
[1:14:18] BUT MY GOD SAYS, "I SEE ONE OF MY SONS.
[1:14:23] UH, I SEE ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS. I PLACE A
[1:14:26] PART OF MYSELF IN THEM."
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; AND HERE, MICHELANGELO. HE HAD A VISION.
[1:14:33] AMEN. STARTS GULPING. AND HERE COMES
[1:14:36] DAVID.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; GLORY. GLORY. THAT'S WHAT GOD DID WITH
[1:14:42] US.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT WORTHY, BUT HE SAID I WAS. SO
[1:14:48] WHY WILL WE LET SATAN KICK US AROUND?
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; WHY DO WE LET SATAN TAKE OUR VICTORY,
[1:14:57] take our joy, take our peace, take our
[1:15:00] health?
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; THE SEED THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS AN
[1:15:04] UNSTOPPABLE SEED.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; AN UNSTOPPABLE. SATAN TRIED IT THROUGH
[1:15:10] THE AGES. SATAN TRIED IT EVEN WITH
[1:15:13] CHRIST. BUT OH LORD, he he conquered
[1:15:18] hell, DEATH, AND THE GRAVE. AND BECAUSE
[1:15:22] I LIVE, YE LIVE ALSO.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Think of THE REJECTION OF THAT MARBLE.
[1:15:37] David laid there in that piece of marble
[1:15:41] since the beginning of time. WOO!
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; MY BELOVED,
[1:15:47] tell me, why are you so excited? Well,
[1:15:50] because there was some dust on the
[1:15:52] earth. There was for one time. Amen.
[1:15:55] That God wanted me to live on this age.
[1:15:57] Amen. In this season, Amen. Because why?
[1:16:01] Because he chose me for such a time as
[1:16:03] this.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Even in Laia when hell is Oh, yes.
[1:16:12] Because greater is he that is in me than
[1:16:14] he THAT IS IN THAT IS AGAINST ME.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; GLORY, GLORY, GLORY. AMEN. AMEN. So
[1:16:23] let's continue. You could continue on
[1:16:25] that. But Amen. He says, "Amen.
[1:16:29] You are here because your name was
[1:16:31] placed
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; on the lamb's book of life before there
[1:16:34] even was a foundation of the world."
[1:16:37] Have you ever thought of that?
[1:16:39] We take things for granted. We walk on
[1:16:41] this earth, no matter how old, how young
[1:16:43] we are. But even before this earth was
[1:16:47] created,
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; my name was written already in his book.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. He says, "You're a
[1:16:59] gene, a spiritual gene out of your
[1:17:01] heavenly father, a part of God's word.
[1:17:09] Now Jeremiah, you know the story about
[1:17:12] Jeremiah. Amen. Before I formed thee in
[1:17:15] thy belly, I knew thee.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Before I breath, my first breath.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; And that's for each and every one of
[1:17:24] you.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; He knew me.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Come on. Are you with me?
[1:17:30] It doesn't matter if I have 100,000, one
[1:17:34] million, or I don't care how many that
[1:17:36] know me. As long as he knows me
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; and I know him.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; I don't care. Amen. How Satan has
[1:17:46] polluted everything. We need followers.
[1:17:48] No, WE NEED TO BE FOLLOWERS OF CHRIST.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. So Jeremiah then said, "Ah,
[1:17:57] here he is. What do I do? I'm a little
[1:18:00] nobody. Like often we say, I don't know
[1:18:02] what to do. This trial is SO BIG. THIS
[1:18:05] THIS BATTLE IS I DON'T know how I how I.
[1:18:08] It's not me, it's he.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Then said I, OH LORD GOD, BEHOLD, I
[1:18:15] CANNOT SPEAK,
[1:18:17] for I am a child. But the Lord said unto
[1:18:20] me, Say not, I am a child, for thou
[1:18:23] shalt go TO ALL THAT I SHALL SEND THEE.
[1:18:27] AMEN.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; AND WHATSOEVER I COMMAND THEE, THOU
[1:18:30] SHALT SPEAK, BE NOT AFRAID OF THEIR
[1:18:32] FACES, FOR I AM WITH THEE to deliver
[1:18:35] thee, sayeth the Lord. THEN THE LORD PUT
[1:18:37] FORTH HIS HAND and touch my mouth. And
[1:18:40] the Lord SAID UNTO ME, BEHOLD, I HAVE
[1:18:43] PUT MY WORDS IN THY mouth
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; and things that are to be.
[1:18:53] Are you hearing my t the title of the
[1:18:55] prophet things that are to be
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; now?
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; The only way that you can be a son and a
[1:19:03] daughter of God because you have to have
[1:19:05] eternal life and there's only one form
[1:19:06] of eternal life and that's God's life.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONE FORM OF ETERNAL LIFE
[1:19:11] AND THAT WAS GOD. There to be a son you
[1:19:13] had to be in him
[1:19:16] always.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Come on saints.
[1:19:21] THE GENE OF YOUR LIFE, SPIRITUAL LIFE
[1:19:23] TONIGHT WAS IN GOD THE FATHER BEFORE
[1:19:27] THERE EVEN WAS A MOLECULE.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; And you're nothing but the manifestation
[1:19:35] of the gene of life that was in God as a
[1:19:39] son of God.
[1:19:42] Now, now you're expressed after his word
[1:19:44] comes in you. You see the importance of
[1:19:47] the word coming in you, you becoming the
[1:19:51] word, the word becoming you.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about an
[1:19:55] intellectual knowledge.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the dynamics on the
[1:20:00] mechanics.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. People can quote many quotes many
[1:20:05] many Bible verses, but it's only
[1:20:07] intellectual knowledge. The only way you
[1:20:10] CAN KNOW GOD IS BY AN EXPERIENCE WHERE
[1:20:13] GOD PERSONALLY REVEALS HIMSELF TO YOU.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. THEREFORE, he Amen. You are
[1:20:23] expressing God's life in you because you
[1:20:25] are a son and a daughter of God.
[1:20:27] Wherever you are,
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; wherever you are, God knew that you
[1:20:33] would be here.
[1:20:35] Brother, are you on the side on on the
[1:20:36] on the end of the He knew you were
[1:20:38] sitting there.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; I'm always sitting there. I don't even
[1:20:41] know. But God knows where why you're
[1:20:43] sitting there,
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Because you have to be one of his genes
[1:20:54] or his attributes. You have to be. If
[1:20:56] you ever got eternal life, then it
[1:20:58] always was eternal life. And God before
[1:21:00] there was a foundation of the world, he
[1:21:02] knew that you would be here. Now God
[1:21:05] doesn't make mistakes.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; And when the word or the water, the
[1:21:11] washing of the water of the words fell
[1:21:14] upon you, it was expressing a being.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Just like Michelangelo started hitting
[1:21:20] that marble. Amen. He saw something
[1:21:23] inside. And that's why this true
[1:21:26] FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY SAYS NOTHING ELSE BUT
[1:21:30] WHAT THE WORD HAS SAID ALREADY. NOT
[1:21:33] ADDING TO YOU, NOT TAKING AWAY. WHY?
[1:21:37] AMEN. THE WASHING OF THE WATER OF THE
[1:21:39] WORD.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; OH, I don't need it, brother David. YES,
[1:21:43] YOU DO. EVEN MORE THAN YOU THINK. AMEN.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD ANNOUNCED THE MINISTRY TO
[1:21:49] SPEAK
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; PERSONALLY TO YOU,
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; DON'T GET MAD.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; BE HUMBLE AND SAY, "LORD, LET IT BE
[1:21:56] ACCORDING TO THY WORD."
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; We know that one Corinthians 11 says,
[1:22:08] "The woman is the glory of the man."
[1:22:11] Amen. Amen. That's right.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thine the glory
[1:22:17] then.
[1:22:24] Love you too, brother.
[1:22:29] The Bible talks about how we are the
[1:22:33] jewels in his crown.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; I don't see myself as a jewel.
[1:22:40] You don't see yourself as a jewel.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Now let let me just
[1:22:47] you know a diamond
[1:22:49] is just a piece of coal.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; It's only the experts that can
[1:22:58] distinguish
[1:23:00] what is what.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Only the great sculpture.
[1:23:07] He knows all about us
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; and he knows what he laid inside of us.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; So a diamond is just a piece of coal.
[1:23:19] You know what that did well under
[1:23:22] pressure.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Come on saints.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Even though we are living in Laudisa,
[1:23:31] there's a lot of pressure but it's for
[1:23:33] our good. It's for our good saints.
[1:23:36] Amen. Because a diamond Amen. becomes a
[1:23:39] true diamond when he's under pressure.
[1:23:42] Amen. Amen. So let Amen. There's many
[1:23:45] things against us.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; BUT GREATER IS HE THAT is in you. Amen.
[1:23:51] And he that is against you.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; SO LET GOD HAVE HIS WAY IN MY LIFE, IN
[1:23:56] YOUR LIFE, AND YOUR THIS SEED is
[1:23:59] unstoppable.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:04] Come on, saints.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; You know, rough diamonds vary greatly in
[1:24:09] appearance. You have big ones, small
[1:24:11] ones. We're all different.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; But what a nice bouquet we have here
[1:24:14] tonight.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful jewels we have. Oh, I
[1:24:19] didn't think I was going to hear that.
[1:24:20] It's not only for the sisters that like
[1:24:22] the big diamonds. You know, BROTHERS,
[1:24:25] YOU ARE DIAMONDS, TOO.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. They can be perfectly listen
[1:24:34] symmetrical,
[1:24:36] twisted, deformed like that marble.
[1:24:40] Nobody sees what what does anybody see
[1:24:43] in me? Thank God my wife saw something
[1:24:45] in me.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; But she's not the only one. God saw
[1:24:49] something before my wife saw something
[1:24:50] in me.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Just like you.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Twisted, deformed, luminous,
[1:24:56] clear, foggy. Amen. It doesn't matter.
[1:24:59] Amen. They have a potential of beauty.
[1:25:01] Amen. that any experienced tailor or
[1:25:03] store stone cutter will recognize. You
[1:25:06] know why?
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Listen now. Because no matter what they
[1:25:11] look on the outside,
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; no matter what we look ON THE OUTSIDE,
[1:25:19] ALL DIAMONDS ARE MADE OF THE SAME
[1:25:22] PERFECT CHEMICAL ANATOMIC COMPOSITION
[1:25:25] INSIDE. SO NO MATTER HOW WE LOOK, I'M
[1:25:29] NOT WHAT I HAVE TO BE, BUT I AIN'T WHAT
[1:25:31] I USED TO BE. I'M ON MY WAY.
[1:25:35] WE ARE ON OUR WAY. GOD AIN'T FINISHED
[1:25:38] WITH ME. HE AIN'T FINISHED WITH YOU. BUT
[1:25:41] GOD IS BRINGING US TO PERFECTION.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And Satan comes playing with our
[1:25:49] minds, telling you, you're nobody. You
[1:25:51] cannot make it. BUT THE LORD TELLS US,
[1:25:54] YOU'RE MY DIAMOND. I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU
[1:25:56] YET. SO JUST CONTINUE
[1:26:00] what we just quoted it. The only thing
[1:26:02] we say is I believe God.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Not I believe what Satan says. Not what
[1:26:08] the report of the doctor says. Not not
[1:26:10] what ANYBODY SAYS. WHAT GOD SAYS ABOUT
[1:26:13] ME.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. We know that the big
[1:26:18] diamond the prophet talks about it.
[1:26:20] Amen. He was wounded for our
[1:26:22] transgressions.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:24] Hallelujah. He was bruised for our
[1:26:26] iniquity. The chastisement of our peace,
[1:26:29] amen, was upon him. AND BY HIS STRIPES,
[1:26:32] WE ARE ALREADY HEALED.
[1:26:35] WHAT WAS HE DOING? REFLECTING.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; He is the Messiah, the big diamond.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; And we are the messettes.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Any man that claims to be a
[1:26:50] certain God and that denies divine
[1:26:52] healing and his power is not getting his
[1:26:55] light from that diamond. Not getting his
[1:26:57] light from that throne.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; SHINE ON ME, LORD.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; SHINE ON ME.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO COME TO MATURITY.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT a junior baby believer.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; The time has come with the opening of
[1:27:14] the word
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; that we have come to maturity. That's
[1:27:18] why the word of God tells us we have to
[1:27:20] lay in the presence of the Sen. That's
[1:27:23] what is going on when we hear the word.
[1:27:26] We hear of Ryphen AND WE HEAR FROM GOD
[1:27:29] TELLING US WHO WE ARE.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; SHINE ON ME LORD.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; LORD.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. because it's reflecting him
[1:27:40] the same yesterday, today, and forever
[1:27:43] in Oh, hallelujah. Through those seven
[1:27:45] church ages. Amen. What God did in
[1:27:47] Christ, Christ does in you. What s What
[1:27:50] signs God did in Christ, Christ does in
[1:27:53] you.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something?
[1:27:59] God didn't just choose uses to
[1:28:03] walk on this earth
[1:28:05] and to say, "I'm I'm a message
[1:28:07] believer."
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Is that okay,
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; young boys?
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; He chose us for a specific purpose.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; To destroy Satan's kingdom.
[1:28:27] When Satan has
[1:28:29] pulled everything he had,
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; everything hell on the earth, God says,
[1:28:36] "I will raise a standard."
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; There will be a bride without spot,
[1:28:42] without wrinkle.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; He chose me for that. He chose you for
[1:28:46] that. Yes, he did. Let me continue for a
[1:28:49] little while. Amen. So, could you
[1:28:52] imagine God gave us what?
[1:28:55] the most powerful weapon we could have.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Now, the problem is, and I know I'm in
[1:29:00] the United States, so don't pull guns on
[1:29:01] me now.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Sister Nancy, love you. Don't get your
[1:29:07] gun out.
[1:29:15] God gave us
[1:29:17] the most powerful weapon there is in the
[1:29:20] earth.
[1:29:23] And here we think because I have a
[1:29:25] machine gun, I have a rifle, I have a
[1:29:28] bazooka, I have a tank, I have this,
[1:29:30] that I'm powerful. No, God gave you
[1:29:33] already the most powerful weapon.
[1:29:36] Whether you're a little young boy here
[1:29:39] or an elderly sister, no matter, he gave
[1:29:41] us the most powerful weapon,
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; that is his word. Now, the prophet tells
[1:29:48] us, Amen. If you are in the United
[1:29:50] States, Amen. He says, "Amen." When they
[1:29:53] are the United States Army training a
[1:29:55] man to sit around and eat cookies and so
[1:29:57] forth, think of it.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Your taxes pay millions
[1:30:04] for those guys to eat cookies.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; I'm bringing it home now. Huh?
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; I know money is always a sensitive
[1:30:14] thing. Sorry, I don't want to get in.
[1:30:20] He gives a uniform. He gives a gun and
[1:30:23] trains the soldiers to get out there and
[1:30:27] fight and defend the nation.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; And that's what we've got to do. We've
[1:30:34] got to defend OUR GODGIVEN RIGHTS. WHAT
[1:30:38] GOD SAID, IT'S OURS.
[1:30:43] THE PROBLEM IS IF you don't know what is
[1:30:45] yours,
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; how can you defend what is yours?
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Ask and you shall receive.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; No matter what it is,
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; my Lord and Savior, he is the answer to
[1:31:03] it all.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Let me continue for a little while here.
[1:31:09] Amen. He says they are ours. We believe
[1:31:12] him and you just might as well move back
[1:31:15] because you have nothing at all. Telling
[1:31:17] Satan you have nothing at all.
[1:31:20] Satan has got one legal rights of
[1:31:22] anything. Everything he's got.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Come on. Why don't YOU SAY IT WITH ME?
[1:31:29] EVERYTHING HE'S GOT IS DEFEATED. THE
[1:31:33] ONLY THING HE IS IS A SCARECROW. THAT'S
[1:31:36] ALL. HE CANNOT BOTHER YOU.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; OH, brother David, that sounds so good,
[1:31:44] but I still have battles. What do you
[1:31:46] think you're here for?
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; For a picnic.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; To eat cookies.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; The problem is YOU LOOK THROUGH YOUR
[1:31:54] EYES AND YOU THINK YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR
[1:31:56] MUSCLES. YOU USED TO HAVE your gun, YOUR
[1:31:58] MACHINE GUN. NO. USE THE WEAPON THAT GOD
[1:32:02] GAVE YOU. THE WORD OF GOD. IT IS
[1:32:06] WRITTEN. I BELIEVE IT. I DON'T
[1:32:09] UNDERSTAND IT. I DON'T SEE IT, BUT I
[1:32:11] BELIEVE IT.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Think of it. Now, this is not just
[1:32:20] Brother Brandham saying something to say
[1:32:22] something nice. Are you hearing me,
[1:32:24] brother David? I heard it. Well, it's
[1:32:26] about time it becomes a reality.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING HE'S GOT IS DEFEATED. THE
[1:32:31] ONLY THING HE IS IS A SCARECROW.
[1:32:35] Do you think why brother Ron Amen he
[1:32:37] dares to say service after service or
[1:32:40] your boo devil
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; from the youngest to the oldest you can
[1:32:48] say by faith not like a big mountain but
[1:32:51] a mustard SEED FAITH BOO GET THEE BEHIND
[1:32:55] ME I AM A SON OF GOD I AM A DAUGHTER OF
[1:32:59] GOD.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; He cannot bother you now. He, brother
[1:33:09] David, he bothers me. He comes. Resist
[1:33:11] the devil and he will flee from you.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Brother David, I have this illness for
[1:33:18] stand for what God has given you.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; A man that's born of the spirit of God,
[1:33:25] THERE'S NOTHING AT ALL THAT can harm
[1:33:28] him. That's right.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Come on, soldiers of the cross.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I say this belongs to me AND
[1:33:36] THAT'S MY LEGAL POSSESSION. BY HIS
[1:33:39] STRIPES, I AM ALREADY HEALED.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; You know what the problem is?
[1:33:48] We doubt the weapon
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; and we lose confidence
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; in the great sculpture
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; and a creator
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; because we prayed and it can last on for
[1:34:04] months and months and I've had enough.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Do you imagine one of the American
[1:34:11] soldiers standing on the battlefront?
[1:34:15] He's there and then all of a sudden,
[1:34:16] well, this this thing here that I have,
[1:34:18] uh, I don't trust it anymore because
[1:34:21] I've been you, it's been months and and
[1:34:23] and and
[1:34:26] that's what we do with the word of God.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; We start doubting what God has promised
[1:34:31] already
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; because Satan comes around. He plays
[1:34:34] with our head. He plays with our mind.
[1:34:36] But God plays something inside of each
[1:34:38] and every one of you there. Amen. That
[1:34:40] is a seed gene of God. Amen. That is way
[1:34:43] stronger than what Satan can put in your
[1:34:45] mind.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; If you can JUST SAY, "I BELIEVE GOD."
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; WHY DID BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY WHEN THEY
[1:34:52] CAME IN THE PRAYER LINES,
[1:34:54] "Go thank God for your healing."
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Why does brother Ron, and yes, he's your
[1:35:00] pastor, you know VERY WELL. BUT WHY IS
[1:35:02] HE SUCH A TESTIMONY not only to the
[1:35:05] believers, to doctors,
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; to cancer patients,
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE HE'S NOT ACTING ON HIS
[1:35:12] FEELINGS.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT ACTING on how he feels OR WHAT
[1:35:15] THE CHURCH SAY OR WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY.
[1:35:17] HE'S STANDING ON THE PROMISES OF GOD.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S NOT ONLY FOR BROTHER RON.
[1:35:23] WHAT ABOUT US? WHAT ABOUT YOU?
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; EVERY REDEMPTIVE BLESSING OF GOD BELONGS
[1:35:34] to you. IT'S YOUR PERSONAL PROPERTY.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Personal property.
[1:35:42] You got a right to claim it. Now,
[1:35:45] believe me, if I tell you the White
[1:35:49] House is yours, you will go claim it.
[1:35:54] Do I make a point?
[1:35:56] Now, there's this big ballroom or
[1:35:58] whatever you call it.
[1:36:04] I got an amen there.
[1:36:12] you would go claim it.
[1:36:15] And God tells us that every promise in
[1:36:18] the book is yours.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Every chapter, every verse, every line.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Why don't we claim our God-given
[1:36:27] privileges?
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; He died to pay the total, full,
[1:36:34] complete, and I don't know how many
[1:36:35] other words you can put, price. All
[1:36:38] right.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; For us,
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; so it's not in our strength. It's in the
[1:36:44] Lord
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; that is our strength.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "But that's up to you now
[1:36:50] to go claim it and say, "It is written."
[1:36:53] When you ask for anything, go get it.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; MY KIDS, WHEN THEY ASK SOMETHING, WE
[1:36:59] WANT ICE CREAM, you have to go get it.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Or you tell them, "Go get it.
[1:37:07] Am I the only one here?
[1:37:13] You know, we do so many things naturally
[1:37:17] and spiritually we miss the simplicity,
[1:37:22] the depth of the word of God.
[1:37:26] That's why many people they're confused
[1:37:28] because after the opening of the seventh
[1:37:30] seal there was silence and there
[1:37:34] no something real is going on. See if we
[1:37:36] go there tomorrow. But something real is
[1:37:38] going on.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; He's revealing his secrets. What
[1:37:41] secrets? Who you are
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; that you are an invincible army, an
[1:37:47] unstoppable seed of God.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Think of it. if you could only realize
[1:37:55] who you are
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; and what God wants to do with you.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; So when you ask for anything, go get it
[1:38:03] and don't take nothing less. Get what
[1:38:06] you asked because we are heir to all
[1:38:08] things.
[1:38:10] Heir to all things.
[1:38:14] The bride of Christ owns every speck of
[1:38:19] it.
[1:38:21] You know what every speck of it is?
[1:38:24] that every even a point a comma
[1:38:30] question mark anything every speck is
[1:38:33] yours.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; What what what good is a is a dot. Hey
[1:38:40] you eat the full book.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; You eat the whole book.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; So you become the book. Let's continue.
[1:38:47] Where is the God? He says that led Jesus
[1:38:51] Christ from victory unto victory. Amen.
[1:38:54] When you got God on your side, who can
[1:38:58] be against you?
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. WHEN YOU GOT GOD ON YOUR SIDE, WHO
[1:39:03] can be against you? Amen. So, Satan, he
[1:39:06] will try to hinder EVERY MEETING AS HARD
[1:39:10] AS HE CAN.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Satan will come around with mind
[1:39:14] battles.
[1:39:16] Not only mind battles, he will come
[1:39:18] around with a very tiring spirit.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; This brother David, he's wearing me out.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; And if it's for a bowl game,
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; okay, now I'm going to the sisters.
[1:39:40] Sorry. Maybe they also followed ball
[1:39:43] games here. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay.
[1:39:48] When they prepare a nice Christmas cake,
[1:39:51] birthday cake, they're into it.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine Sister Katie making a
[1:39:58] nice cake for Brother Andrew? And and in
[1:40:00] the middle of the kitchen, oh,
[1:40:04] Brother Andrew comes home. Hey, honey.
[1:40:06] How are you? And she's laying in a cake.
[1:40:12] It's good. Good. I got your attention.
[1:40:17] That's what Satan, that's the prophet
[1:40:19] that says the devil comes arise comes
[1:40:22] around trying to hinder every meeting as
[1:40:26] hard as he can.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; He's trying to keep to to to take your
[1:40:33] focus of the word of God.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why personally, you know
[1:40:38] where my favorite place is in the church
[1:40:40] when I visit a church when I'm not
[1:40:42] preaching. Amen. And even is IN THE
[1:40:45] FRONT.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? WAY IN THE BACK. YOU SEE
[1:40:49] SO MANY THINGS.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; This one is falling asleep. Oh, and and
[1:40:55] you miss
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; ONE WORD, SAINTS. ONE WORD CAN CHANGE
[1:41:00] YOUR LIFE.
[1:41:09] OH, not me, brother David. Oh, yes.
[1:41:12] Exactly. Each and every one of us.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Because Satan is very subtle. He is very
[1:41:17] subtle. Amen. So, he will do that to
[1:41:20] every God sent meeting.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; That's what we having.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil will work everything he
[1:41:27] can to keep it from coming, BUT YOU GO
[1:41:31] ANYHOW.
[1:41:34] WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD, AMEN. SATAN CAN
[1:41:37] TELL YOU, "OH, MY LEG is still hurting,
[1:41:38] or I still feel MY STOMACH, OR I STILL
[1:41:40] HAVE A HEADACHE." YOU GO GET IT. IT'S
[1:41:43] YOUR GOD-GIVEN PRIVILEGES.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID SO. YOU STAND TOE-TO-TOE WITH
[1:41:51] HIM AND SAY, "IT'S THUS, SAYETH THE
[1:41:53] LORD, YOU RESIST THE DEVIL AND HE WILL
[1:41:55] FLEE FROM YOU." AMEN.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; And we who are in contact with the
[1:42:03] spiritual realm of God.
[1:42:06] Well, I was prayed for and I didn't get
[1:42:08] healed. So, I guess there's nothing to
[1:42:10] it. What a poor crow crowbait you make
[1:42:14] for God.
[1:42:17] God wants somebody.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Do we have somebody's here? Amen. Come
[1:42:22] on.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; God wants somebody who will not give up.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, SAINTS.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; WHO DON'T GIVE UP? AMEN. NO MATTER WHAT
[1:42:35] COMES. AMEN. WE hear news WE DIDN'T
[1:42:37] EXPECT. BUT ALL IS WELL.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; ALL IS WELL.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE GOD SAID SO.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT DEPENDING ON MY STRENGTH. I'M
[1:42:49] NOT COUNTING ON MY FORCE, ON MY POWER.
[1:42:52] I'M COUNTING ON THE LORD.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY WHO WILL NOT GIVE UP. A WINNER
[1:43:00] NEVER QUITS AND A QUITTER NEVER WINS.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; You tell him that's the way to do to go
[1:43:10] get it.
[1:43:12] You say, "THUS SAYETH THE LORD, GOD DONE
[1:43:15] YOUR HEALING. I SHALL RECEIVE IT. IT'S
[1:43:17] MINE. IT'S MY PERSONAL PROPERTY.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; There you are. There is the body of
[1:43:25] Christ living, standing, redeemed.
[1:43:30] Why? Listen now.
[1:43:34] We are
[1:43:39] not we will be not we were
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; we are what are we?
[1:43:48] his victory.
[1:43:50] Are you hearing me?
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; That means victory is you triumph over
[1:43:56] everything. You know in the millennium
[1:43:58] we will not need divine healing.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; We will not need deliverances.
[1:44:03] In the millennium we won't need we won't
[1:44:05] need every god-given promise.
[1:44:09] It is for us IN OUR SEASON, IN OUR TIME.
[1:44:13] BECAUSE WITH the opening of the book,
[1:44:15] with the revealed word comes THE
[1:44:17] RESTORATION OF THE POWER.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; GREATER is he that is IN YOU THAN HE
[1:44:23] THAT IS AGAINST YOU.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, I'm the least in the
[1:44:33] church. Did anybody think that? I don't
[1:44:35] not ask you to raise hands. I'm just
[1:44:37] going to say, "Yeah,
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; because that's what Satan tells. You're
[1:44:41] the least in the church.
[1:44:44] I'm just a little bitty fellow.
[1:44:47] What does God want?" I mean,
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; that little soldier.
[1:44:54] I'm not diminishing you, huh, boys?
[1:44:57] You're great heroes of the faith.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz when you have childlike faith, Satan
[1:45:04] is finished.
[1:45:08] So the prophet says here
[1:45:12] just a little bitty fellow he says
[1:45:14] remember when he ascended on high see
[1:45:16] you are raised with him you're in the
[1:45:18] body and you're with Christ right now
[1:45:20] seated in heavenly places if you're the
[1:45:23] skin of the bottom of the feet
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; I can still do that at my age you
[1:45:39] I'm still young. Hallelujah.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Don't look at the hair.
[1:45:48] Amen. If you're THE SKIN ON THE BOTTOM
[1:45:50] OF YOUR FEET,
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; there's only one devil under your feet.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; No. No. No. No. No. No. No. That's not
[1:45:58] what he says. That's not what God says
[1:46:02] us. He says every
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; devil is underneath you.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; So you know
[1:46:18] you have needs. Brother David doesn't
[1:46:20] know anything about your needs.
[1:46:24] But God has a plan for you because
[1:46:28] there's an unstoppable seed in you
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; that Satan through the ages tried to
[1:46:34] stop. And now we come at the pinnacle.
[1:46:38] We come at the age where God said, "I
[1:46:42] will have a bride
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; and she will be bone of my bone, flesh
[1:46:50] of my flesh, spirit of my spirit.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; She is him."
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; How does that make you feel?
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; God is still almighty.
[1:47:07] Even tonight, even when things look
[1:47:10] impossible,
[1:47:12] I'm going to get through a few examples.
[1:47:14] When did I start preaching? I don't
[1:47:15] know.
[1:47:18] So, every devil is underneath you. Where
[1:47:21] the head is, the body is. And we are
[1:47:23] seated in heavenly places in Christ
[1:47:24] Jesus with every fire of hell under us.
[1:47:29] So, it's not we have to go through
[1:47:32] Laudia.
[1:47:34] We have victory in Laudia.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. Come on.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Every sickness. Amen. Every sin,
[1:47:43] everything, even death itself. That's
[1:47:45] right. We are more than conquerors in
[1:47:49] him.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Let me go for a few moments
[1:47:55] to the scripture because Satan, he wants
[1:47:57] us
[1:47:58] to learn to live
[1:48:02] with these demons.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:05] I call them demons because sickness is a
[1:48:07] demon.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Any anything that is contrary to the
[1:48:11] word is a demon.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Comes from Satan.
[1:48:16] And Daniel 11:32 says, "And such as do
[1:48:18] wickedly against the covenant shall be
[1:48:20] corrupt by flatteries, but the people
[1:48:22] that know their God,
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; they shall be strong and do exploits."
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; So we see a few words there. And if you
[1:48:33] look in the Greek lexican, amen,
[1:48:35] wickedly is mean to be guilty, to be
[1:48:37] condemned. The people that know their
[1:48:39] God, the people is a flock, is a troops,
[1:48:42] the troops of the living God.
[1:48:45] The kindred says the Greek lexican
[1:48:48] only
[1:48:50] the ones he chose.
[1:48:54] That know means to know by experience,
[1:48:56] to be acquainted with, to be revealed.
[1:48:59] Amen. They shall be strong. That means
[1:49:01] to prevail upon, to grow firm, to be
[1:49:03] secure, to withstand.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; And exploit means a heroic act to make
[1:49:10] productive use of it.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; PRODUCTIVE USE OF YOUR WEAPON.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Not lay IT THERE ON THE SHELF.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER RON, CAN YOU PLEASE PRAY FOR
[1:49:22] ME? AND NO, YOU HAVE A WEAPON.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; USE YOUR WEAPON. CLAIM YOUR GOD-GIVEN
[1:49:30] RIGHT. DEFEND WHAT IS YOURS.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. So a person either knows God or
[1:49:38] doesn't know God. 1 John 5:20 says, "And
[1:49:41] we know that the son of God has come and
[1:49:42] had given us an understanding that we
[1:49:44] may know him that is true and we are in
[1:49:47] him. That is true even in his son Jesus
[1:49:49] Christ. This is the true God and eternal
[1:49:52] life."
[1:49:57] So those that don't turn away, those
[1:49:59] that know their God from the truth of
[1:50:02] the word of God, they will be strong and
[1:50:06] do exploits.
[1:50:08] What does John 14:12 says?
[1:50:13] Are you following? Can you pull that up
[1:50:15] so everybody can see it?
[1:50:18] Why don't you read it with me? Amen.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
[1:50:26] believeth on me, the works that I do
[1:50:30] shall he do also, AND GREATER WORKS than
[1:50:33] these shall he do, because I go unto the
[1:50:37] father.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; THAT'S CONCERNING US.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE EXPLOITS God wants us to do.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Me? Yes, you.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Abraham. Let's take an example. Abraham.
[1:50:52] I'm coming to a point trying to wind
[1:50:54] out. But Abraham, he was 75 years old.
[1:50:57] Sarah was 65. Amen. He was married with
[1:51:00] her. Amen. Then he continued and he
[1:51:02] says, "Well, she was past menopause and
[1:51:05] it was impossible for her to have a
[1:51:07] baby.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Those are the facts.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; You have many facts in your life.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; My stomach is this. My heart is this. My
[1:51:18] brain is this. My kidneys are this.
[1:51:22] My job is this. My house is this. My
[1:51:24] family is this.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; JUST FACTS.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; FACTS.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51:32] GOD ASKED ABRAHAM TO believe the
[1:51:36] impossible.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; I love it, brother. As long as it was
[1:51:44] for Abraham.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:51:47] That was good. You know, it was good
[1:51:48] because you know Abraham, he was a hero
[1:51:51] of the faith after all. You know, he's
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; okay.
[1:51:58] How many believe God sent us
[1:52:01] his word in our age?
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, let's listen what God says.
[1:52:06] God asked Abraham to believe the
[1:52:07] impossible. AND HE ASKED YOU, the seed
[1:52:10] of Abraham, to believe THE IMPOSSIBLE
[1:52:13] BECAUSE HIS WORD is a creative thing.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM JUST HELD ON TO GOD'S WORD. HE
[1:52:21] BELIEVED GOD. THAT'S ALL HE HAD TO DO.
[1:52:24] HE DIDN'T LOOK HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS. HE
[1:52:26] JUST ACCEPTED IT
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; AND TOOK GOD AT HIS WORD AND WENT TO
[1:52:32] rejoicing over it.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; God loved that.
[1:52:39] We can go rejoicing.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Let us rejoice and be glad.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; For a bride has made herself ready.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can rejoice over your
[1:52:50] trial. Oh yeah, but my leg is is is is
[1:52:54] avoiding me to, you know, to to feel the
[1:52:56] liberty in the house of God. Don't
[1:52:58] worry. Start just, you know, brother
[1:53:00] Brandon says if you have pain, JUST EVEN
[1:53:03] START moving your little finger and
[1:53:05] little by little and little and a little
[1:53:07] WHEN THE ANOINTING COMES DOWN. AMEN. AND
[1:53:10] YOU WON'T FEEL YOUR PAIN ANYMORE.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE GOD WE SERVE.
[1:53:16] ABRAHAM BELIEVED AGAINST ALL ODDS.
[1:53:19] HE GREW STRONGER IN THE FAITH.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. We shouldn't come in this
[1:53:24] building.
[1:53:26] I'm making it very personal now, but in
[1:53:29] the time that we're living, saints,
[1:53:32] there's not much TIME LEFT. AND GOD GAVE
[1:53:35] US EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING WE HAVE NEED
[1:53:37] OF IN OUR LIFE JOURNEY.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; We should COME IN THIS HOUSE REJOICING.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Giving God glory.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD JESUS. I HAD A BIG TRIAL
[1:53:50] TODAY.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS. LET ME GIVE A
[1:53:54] TESTIMONY.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Brother David, you're completely Woohoo.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:54:03] I know the God that I serve.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; If God can create eyes, can make legs
[1:54:10] grow, Amen. can put hips back in place,
[1:54:13] can heal cancers, CAN MAKE THE DEAD
[1:54:15] RISE, HE'S STILL THE SAME GOD WE SERVE
[1:54:18] TONIGHT.
[1:54:22] WE'RE NOT WALKING WHAT WE SEE. WE WALK
[1:54:26] BY FAITH.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; AND IF ABRAHAM AMEN. THAT'S WHY HE MAKES
[1:54:30] IT PERSONAL. HE ASKED YOU, THE SEED OF
[1:54:33] ABRAHAM, TO BELIEVE the impossible.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; He held unto God's word. Abraham,
[1:54:44] he didn't become weaker and weaker.
[1:54:52] Let the weak say I am strong.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Let the blind say I can see.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Hosana hosana to the king of kings.
[1:55:04] That's why saints, let's not miss every
[1:55:07] opportunity God gives us
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; to give glory to God.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Cuz he says, "Let go and rejoice."
[1:55:17] Can you imagine Abraham, "Honey, you're
[1:55:20] going to have a baby."
[1:55:22] The first day, those that are married,
[1:55:25] there he goes.
[1:55:27] Oh, yeah.
[1:55:35] And every day he thanked God, rejoiced
[1:55:39] about
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; honey, we can have the promised son.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; What about us?
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; What about us? When the greatest
[1:55:50] treasure has been given to us,
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; a revealed
[1:55:57] Christ revealed to us an open book.
[1:56:02] Why? We are the people of the promised
[1:56:04] land of the book, the open book.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; I'm getting to a point. Give me a few
[1:56:09] more minutes.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; God, he wants that kind of witnesses
[1:56:13] that are courageous. He wants us to be
[1:56:16] courageous.
[1:56:21] He has told every believer the same
[1:56:23] thing just like he did to Joshua and
[1:56:25] Caleb. I'll be with you even to the end
[1:56:28] of the world. I'll never leave you nor
[1:56:29] forsake thee. Courageous. Let's go take
[1:56:31] the promise. God gave us a promise.
[1:56:33] Let's be a real witness.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can even give a testimony before
[1:56:40] it happens.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; I can't remember if I gave that
[1:56:43] testimony here,
[1:56:46] but let me give a testimony. Brother
[1:56:48] Daryl Ward, he he he experienced, maybe
[1:56:50] you heard it, probably you heard a
[1:56:52] sister who didn't have a hip. Probably
[1:56:55] you heard it, but she didn't have a hip.
[1:56:59] And she came in prayer line, was prayed
[1:57:02] for.
[1:57:04] She came back every service. I want to
[1:57:06] give a testimony.
[1:57:08] God, heal me from my hip. Think of it. I
[1:57:11] don't know how she was walking, but
[1:57:12] without a hip, you know.
[1:57:14] Every service after service, I have a
[1:57:17] testimony.
[1:57:20] And it continued, her faith grew
[1:57:23] stronger.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; She rejoiced over the promise that God
[1:57:30] gave.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Until
[1:57:37] people in the church started, here she
[1:57:38] goes again.
[1:57:40] He continued until even the pastor
[1:57:43] listen
[1:57:44] okay one more time
[1:57:47] I'll let you give a testimony
[1:57:50] think of it saints
[1:57:53] and it's exactly at that time at that
[1:57:56] moment
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; the same testimony that was giving
[1:58:03] service after service
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; I want to give glory to God Hallelujah.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; For giving me a hip AND POP
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; HIP POPS. AMEN. THOSE THAT ARE IN THE
[1:58:16] MEDICAL FIELD. AMEN. OH, THEY CAN MAYBE
[1:58:19] PUT IN A FAKE HIP, YOU KNOW, A PROTEISE
[1:58:22] OR SOMETHING. BUT WE SERVE THE CREATOR
[1:58:25] OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. HE CREATED THAT
[1:58:28] HIP. BELIEVE ME, SAINTS. SHE WALKED ON
[1:58:31] THE PLATFORM MAYBE LIKE THIS, BUT SHE
[1:58:34] JUMPED OFF THE PLATFORM GIVING GLORY TO
[1:58:36] GOD.
[1:58:42] SHAME ON US. SHAME ON US.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; IF WE DOUBT GOD'S PROMISES,
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; SHAME ON US. IN ALL THINGS, HE'S WORTHY
[1:58:56] OF OUR PRAISE.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; IN ALL THINGS, IN THE GOOD DAYS, IN THE
[1:59:00] BAD DAYS.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Is he the God only for the sister? He's
[1:59:07] the God for you tonight.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE SAME GOD YESTERDAY, TODAY, and
[1:59:13] forever. Amen. Amen. You know, let me
[1:59:17] You may be seated if just I'm winding
[1:59:19] up. I want to come to an example that I
[1:59:23] love. And that's what God gave me,
[1:59:24] brother Ron.
[1:59:26] He spoke when we arrived Thursday night.
[1:59:29] And he woke me up with that. All is
[1:59:32] well.
[1:59:36] Are you hearing me saints? These are not
[1:59:38] my words.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Don't look through your eyes. Don't look
[1:59:44] through what you can reason, what you
[1:59:47] can understand. Just say, "Lord, I
[1:59:49] believe.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; I believe God. I believe his word."
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; There's a story in the Bible you all
[1:59:57] know, the woman. I just want to focus on
[2:00:01] that situation for a while. We took
[2:00:03] Abraham But listen in two kings 4
[2:00:09] and I'm I'm coming to a certain point
[2:00:12] where he said Elisha what then is to be
[2:00:16] done for her? Elisha asking her oh
[2:00:22] what can be done for her?
[2:00:25] Gahazi answered verily she had no child
[2:00:29] and her husband is old. Those are facts.
[2:00:34] no child and is old.
[2:00:37] Just like we hear many facts,
[2:00:40] even little boys here and as we grow
[2:00:42] older, there are more and more facts.
[2:00:44] They're only facts.
[2:00:47] Heaven and earth will pass away,
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; but the word of God will last forever.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; So here we he said call her. And when he
[2:01:01] had called her, she stood in the door
[2:01:03] and he said, "About this season,
[2:01:04] according to the time of life, thou
[2:01:06] shalt embrace a son." And she said,
[2:01:08] "Nay, my lord, thou man of God, DO NOT
[2:01:11] LIE UNTO thy handmmaid." So look at her
[2:01:14] attitude. HE SAID, "PLEASE DON'T DON'T
[2:01:16] TELL ME SOMETHING.
[2:01:18] DON'T LIE TO ME.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; God never lies to us."
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Satan always lies to us.
[2:01:29] When Satan tells you something, it's a
[2:01:32] lie.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; So if he says you're not going to make
[2:01:36] it, you start rejoicing. Say, "Thank
[2:01:38] God, I'm going to make it."
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; If you have an addiction, START SAYING,
[2:01:42] "THANK YOU, GOD, FOR MY DELIVERANCE."
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE SERVE A GOD THAT STILL
[2:01:47] DELIVERS TODAY,
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; THAT BREAKS EVERY CHAIN OF DOUBT, EVERY
[2:01:52] CHAIN OF SIN.
[2:01:58] So she's saying, "Please
[2:02:00] don't lie to me."
[2:02:05] And the woman conceived and bear a son
[2:02:07] that the season at the season that
[2:02:09] Elisha had said unto her, "According to
[2:02:11] the time of life." And when the child
[2:02:13] was grown, it fell on the day that he
[2:02:15] went out of his father the reapers. And
[2:02:17] he said unto his father, "My head, my
[2:02:20] head."
[2:02:22] Now listen. And he said to a lad, "Cray
[2:02:25] carry him to his mother. And when he had
[2:02:27] taken him and brought him to his mother,
[2:02:29] he sat on her knees till noon and then
[2:02:31] died.
[2:02:33] She went up and laid him on the bed of
[2:02:35] the man of God and shut the door upon
[2:02:38] him and she went out." Then she called
[2:02:41] unto her husband and said, "Send me, I
[2:02:43] pray thee, one of the young men and one
[2:02:44] of these ass, and I may run to the man
[2:02:47] of God and come again." And he said,
[2:02:48] "Wherefore will thou go to him today?
[2:02:52] It is neither new moon nor Sabbath." You
[2:02:55] know, Satan also sometimes he says, "Why
[2:02:59] why would you ask now? Why would you
[2:03:01] rejoice now? Why would you?
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; We we think, you know,
[2:03:06] I didn't get a hold of the pastor and
[2:03:08] and then
[2:03:10] so what? Get a hold of Jesus."
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Get a hold of him.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:18] That makes the whole difference
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; because even though your pastor can pray
[2:03:22] for you, it's according to your faith.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; I don't love brother Ron because he
[2:03:28] prayed for me and it didn't happen.
[2:03:30] Well, you said you were a believer.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Start rejoicing.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; By faith, rejoice and you will grow
[2:03:39] stronger in the faith. Every day you
[2:03:42] will worship and even if you fall, you
[2:03:43] will raise up again.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So he continues, "Amen. Then
[2:03:49] saddle uh sorry it came to pass when the
[2:03:51] man of God saw a far off." We read that
[2:03:53] run now, I pray thee, to meet her and
[2:03:56] say unto her,
[2:03:58] sorry, let me go up verse 23. It is
[2:04:02] neither the new moon nor Sabbath. And
[2:04:03] she said, listen to what she said, what
[2:04:05] she testifies. It shall be well.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; The facts is he's dead.
[2:04:13] The facts say you have cancer. The facts
[2:04:16] say you have problems with YOUR HEART.
[2:04:18] THE FACTS says you have problems WITH
[2:04:20] YOUR JOB. THE FACTS say you Satan tells
[2:04:23] you you're NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; The fact is, well,
[2:04:30] your blood cells, red ones or blue or
[2:04:32] white ones are too low, too high. Your
[2:04:34] kidneys don't work. Your your your lungs
[2:04:37] ARE COMPLETELY OUT AND WHATEVER YOU NAME
[2:04:40] IT.
[2:04:43] and she testifies,
[2:04:46] "It shall be well."
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Then she saddled an ass and said to her
[2:04:51] servant, "Drive and go forward, slack,
[2:04:52] not thy riding for me, except I bid
[2:04:54] thee." So she went and came unto the man
[2:04:56] of God to Mount Carmel. And it came to
[2:04:57] pass when the man of God saw her far
[2:04:59] off. And he said to Ghazi, his servant,
[2:05:02] "Behold, yonder is the tsunami. Run now,
[2:05:04] I pray to meet her, and say unto her,
[2:05:08] Is it well with thee?
[2:05:11] Now the prophet tells us he doesn't
[2:05:13] reveal everything
[2:05:15] to his prophets.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Elisha didn't know anything about
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; is is everything okay?
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; I should have started like this the
[2:05:24] service is is all well.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Come on saints.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; You heard the word tonight is all well.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Sorry. Elisha says, "Amen. Is all well?
[2:05:42] Amen. Uh,
[2:05:46] is it well with thy husband? Is it well
[2:05:48] with thy child?" So he even brings it to
[2:05:50] her husband and the child. And she
[2:05:52] answered,
[2:05:54] "It is well."
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; When you look that up in the lexicon,
[2:06:00] the Greek lexican, you know what the
[2:06:03] word well means?
[2:06:06] Shalom.
[2:06:10] Shalom means peace.
[2:06:13] Peace on earth.
[2:06:17] Are you getting in a Christmas spirit?
[2:06:18] Oh, I had it since Christ came in me.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; It is well.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; That is a peace that God can give us
[2:06:30] beyond any understanding. No matter the
[2:06:33] doctor may tell you this and it looks
[2:06:35] like that and this and that and that.
[2:06:37] all as well.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; And no mental intellectual
[2:06:44] can say a thing like that.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; But the seed, the unstoppable seed of
[2:06:50] God says it by faith. Says it is well.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; All is well.
[2:06:59] And God restored.
[2:07:01] God restored. The prophet I'm I'm I'm
[2:07:03] winding up now. Don't worry. I'm not
[2:07:05] brother Tim.
[2:07:10] I love him. He's my buddy.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know. I know. He's precious.
[2:07:19] He's very precious, brother. It's him.
[2:07:22] Real man of God.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; And he says,
[2:07:31] prophet says, I love that story.
[2:07:36] And here this woman, she laid her child
[2:07:39] on the prophet's bed and her great faith
[2:07:43] in God.
[2:07:48] And when Elisha asked her the question,
[2:07:49] she said, "Is all well with thee? And is
[2:07:52] all well thy husband? It is all thy
[2:07:54] son." Now listen at the woman, the
[2:07:57] prophet says. She says, "All is well."
[2:08:00] What faith
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; I would to God that we could have faith
[2:08:08] like that.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord,
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; faith cometh by hearing, hearing of the
[2:08:15] word of God. Not what the doctor says,
[2:08:18] not what your boss says, NOT WHAT THE
[2:08:21] GOVERNMENT SAYS, NOT WHAT SATAN SAYS,
[2:08:24] BUT WHAT GOD SAYS IS THE ONLY TRUTH.
[2:08:31] And if tonight we could hold onto God's
[2:08:35] representative like that, listen now. If
[2:08:39] you could tell the Holy Spirit tonight,
[2:08:41] as sure as you are, the immortal spirit
[2:08:43] of God, you gave me a promise in the
[2:08:47] Bible of my healing, and I'm going to
[2:08:50] hold on till I see something happen.
[2:08:59] There would be miracles taking place.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; You know God, we serve a miracle working
[2:09:06] God.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; The only limit to God is the limit of
[2:09:10] our faith.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Brother David, you're way too personal.
[2:09:15] I'm not. It has to be personal.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Because God is coming for individuals.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; He's not coming for a group. He's coming
[2:09:23] for individuals.
[2:09:26] Amen. There would be miracles taking
[2:09:28] place. He says the lame would be jumping
[2:09:30] and running.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; GOD BLESS BROTHER MATT.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE HE CAN RESTORE HIS BACKBONE,
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; HIS MUSCLES.
[2:09:44] CAN THESE DRY BONES LIVE? YES, THEY CAN.
[2:09:49] THOU MUST PROPHESY AGAIN.
[2:09:55] YOU SPEAK THE WORD, YOU BELIEVE THE WORD
[2:09:58] AND GO REJOICING.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:10:09] The lame would be jumping and running
[2:10:11] and the doctors of Virginia, he says Los
[2:10:14] Angeles, would be surprised tomorrow to
[2:10:17] see their patients healed and well.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory. THIS IS A TIME OF
[2:10:24] REJOICING. IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT'S
[2:10:26] CHRISTMAS. PEOPLE THINK, "OH, WE NEED AN
[2:10:29] OCCASION." NO. EVERY TIME WE COME INTO
[2:10:33] HIS PRESENCE, WE COME WITH REJOICING.
[2:10:36] AMEN. WITH THANKSGIVING, GIVING GLORY,
[2:10:40] THANKING HIM.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; For the answer to your need.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S HERE. HE'S HERE FOR YOU.
[2:10:52] AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. If I can only get a
[2:10:55] hold of God's agent, God's agent then
[2:10:58] was Elisha. And God's agents today is
[2:11:00] THE HOLY SPIRIT. HOLD ON TO IT. WHEN YOU
[2:11:04] ever come in contact and you feel the
[2:11:06] Holy SPIRIT ON YOU, HOLD ON TO IT.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; It will not leave you.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:19] Stay with it like Jacob did when he
[2:11:22] wrestled with the angel. I'm call going
[2:11:24] to hold on
[2:11:27] until you bless me and give me the
[2:11:28] things that I'm desiring.
[2:11:32] A wonderful revival would break out.
[2:11:36] I'm saying, Lord, revive me.
[2:11:41] You know, many people say there's no
[2:11:45] revival. Well, there is a true revival.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; And it's not limited in the time. It
[2:11:50] goes on. The bride's revival is a
[2:11:53] reality.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; It's not one day up and the next one
[2:11:56] down. It's a continuous
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; from glory to glory. Oh yes, it's a
[2:12:02] battle and we have to fight for every
[2:12:05] inch.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; You know, possession
[2:12:11] footprints, sorry, means possession.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; You know the story. I'm I'm finishing on
[2:12:20] that
[2:12:24] to make it real
[2:12:27] even for whoever
[2:12:30] we think footprints
[2:12:32] means possession.
[2:12:35] Let me give you an example.
[2:12:37] Neil Armstrong.
[2:12:39] Have we who heard of Neil Armstrong
[2:12:42] here?
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Good. Even the young.
[2:12:47] In July 20th, 1969,
[2:12:50] he was the first man
[2:12:54] to put the footprint on the moon.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, they put a flag and there's
[2:13:01] many discussions. It's not about the
[2:13:03] flag.
[2:13:05] The Americans wanted to be the first one
[2:13:08] and they put an imprint
[2:13:11] and they said, "It's mine.
[2:13:16] The Russians could go, the Indians could
[2:13:18] go, the Chinese could go. The Europeans
[2:13:21] could go.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; It's mine."
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; And God tells us, "Go into your land
[2:13:29] now,
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; into your promises."
[2:13:33] And every footprint
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; is your possession.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; You don't need to make giant steps,
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; but just keep on moving forward.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; Just like the testimony I gave about
[2:13:48] that sister, just keep moving forward
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; and it's yours. Don't go backwards.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; You keep on going forward
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; because it's yours.
[2:14:03] Prophet says what the church needs is
[2:14:05] tonight is some more footprints over
[2:14:08] here in the land saying Lord help us.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; God said it's yours.
[2:14:18] He takes an example in the blind man
[2:14:20] Barttous. He says sister you in that
[2:14:23] wheelchair.
[2:14:26] Now facts are a sister in a wheelchair
[2:14:30] cannot make footprints.
[2:14:32] Are you okay on that?
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Agreeing on that? Those are just facts.
[2:14:40] But the people that know their God will
[2:14:42] do exploits.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Will make use of the power of God. So
[2:14:49] the prophet says, "You in a wheelchair
[2:14:52] and you that are in the stretcher, God
[2:14:54] promised you healing.
[2:14:56] You'll have to fight for every inch.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; I don't like fighting. You better fight
[2:15:03] against Satan
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; cuz he's fighting against you. Whether
[2:15:09] he comes with a nice wrapping paper,
[2:15:12] with a nice icing on the cake, it's
[2:15:14] still from the devil.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; But remember,
[2:15:21] the devil will make you fight with the
[2:15:23] sword of God for every inch. But
[2:15:25] remember footprints is possession.
[2:15:28] Whosoever your foot treads that I give
[2:15:30] unto you, every step you can make, you
[2:15:32] know, to gets me that gets me feeling
[2:15:34] really religious. All the land that your
[2:15:38] feet will tread upon in the promised
[2:15:40] land is yours.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; And it's the same for every believer.
[2:15:50] tonight.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; So I'm asking saints.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; Can we testify?
[2:16:00] Can we take another step of faith in the
[2:16:04] impossibility?
[2:16:05] I can have a child. Abraham giving glory
[2:16:08] to God. Having a dead child saying
[2:16:15] having many problems, school, work,
[2:16:19] physical problems, mental problems,
[2:16:24] those are facts.
[2:16:26] But God tells you tonight,
[2:16:30] just
[2:16:32] say thus, say the Lord, the word of God,
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; and go claim your God-given privilege.
[2:16:40] And then you will say, "All is well."
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; And we stand to our feet.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; All is well.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; They had to fight for every inch all the
[2:16:56] way.
[2:16:58] But they had the promise of the victory.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; You have the promise of the victory
[2:17:04] because he told us already, "We are his
[2:17:05] victory." Saints of God, there's so much
[2:17:09] word that God has given. He has given us
[2:17:11] himself.
[2:17:13] We ought to be the happiest.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; The happiest people in the world.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; So why can't we act like it?
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying acting to be an
[2:17:26] actor.
[2:17:29] I'm say acting as a real believer
[2:17:35] because God is still
[2:17:37] a miracle working God.
[2:17:41] Do you know that song? There is power in
[2:17:43] the name of Jesus. He can play softly.
[2:17:48] The prophet
[2:17:53] he send he's talking about the spies
[2:17:55] that were sent out in the country.
[2:17:59] Only two had the testimony.
[2:18:03] How many will have a testimony tonight?
[2:18:07] That all is well.
[2:18:10] Brother David, yes. I do not know your
[2:18:13] problem.
[2:18:16] But I know what God told us.
[2:18:21] You have no feelings for me. I do have
[2:18:23] feelings for you. I have so much love
[2:18:26] for you. But I want to talk to you about
[2:18:28] a greater love, even more greater love
[2:18:30] that God has for us that he says, "Come
[2:18:34] unto me all ye that are heavy laden.
[2:18:37] Come unto me. Give it to me. I'll give
[2:18:39] you shalom.
[2:18:42] All is shalom. All is well.
[2:18:46] How is it possible? I don't know. How is
[2:18:50] it possible that a dead can? I don't
[2:18:52] know.
[2:18:54] The same as how is it possible
[2:18:59] that God said let it be and there was
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; the same as God said you are my son. Me?
[2:19:09] Yes. I chose you. You're You're my
[2:19:13] diamonds. You're my jewels.
[2:19:16] Now it's up to you to reflect my glory.
[2:19:20] Deity is not in heaven.
[2:19:22] It's in you.
[2:19:27] The prophet says
[2:19:30] 10 of them said we can do it. Oh my. The
[2:19:33] opposition was great. The opposition is
[2:19:36] so great. How many times in services
[2:19:39] we don't dare to take a step of faith
[2:19:44] we don't dare I was listening on the
[2:19:46] plane
[2:19:47] my it struck me but Abraham he was
[2:19:50] talking in the service it is I about
[2:19:53] Elijah and says who will I send
[2:19:59] and he he says if there's anybody who
[2:20:01] wants to come and to say who will who
[2:20:05] will I hand and one man comes forward.
[2:20:09] It's a whole Lord God,
[2:20:11] God bless you. One man is standing here.
[2:20:14] Think of it. The prophet talking
[2:20:18] to the audience.
[2:20:21] And then he says,
[2:20:24] I'm going to make it real, very real to
[2:20:27] you now, cuz he is here. Sometimes
[2:20:30] people don't realize that he's here.
[2:20:35] Brother David, I don't feel you don't
[2:20:36] you don't need to feel you believe.
[2:20:42] And then he says,
[2:20:44] going to make it very real, that wasn't
[2:20:46] brother Brandon. Says, you sister, you
[2:20:49] have this, that, that, you brother,
[2:20:53] that's your name. That's your name. This
[2:20:55] is your trouble. Discernment going on.
[2:20:58] Only God knew.
[2:21:04] because he was in his heart. He said the
[2:21:08] preaching of the word, the word is so
[2:21:09] rich, but how do we react to how do we
[2:21:13] respond to that word? Are we willing to
[2:21:16] say, "Send me, Lord.
[2:21:20] Put me on the front line
[2:21:24] so
[2:21:25] our pastor can I'm I'm taking the front
[2:21:28] line now
[2:21:30] so he can rest on
[2:21:34] saints in the army. We need one another.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; We need one another.
[2:21:44] So the prophet he was like a I'm saying
[2:21:47] that now but he was so surprised one man
[2:21:50] came only one man where he says
[2:21:55] you know the verse Elijah take the coal
[2:21:57] of fire
[2:21:59] burn my lips I'm a man with impure lips
[2:22:04] yes whom shall I send
[2:22:08] young sister
[2:22:09] young brother
[2:22:11] whoever forever.
[2:22:14] How many are willing to say,
[2:22:16] "Here I am, Lord.
[2:22:19] Here I am, Lord. Let thy will be done,
[2:22:24] and all is well, no matter what the
[2:22:25] situation may look like." I've heard
[2:22:28] your word,
[2:22:31] and I'm going to act upon it.
[2:22:35] They said the walls are too high,
[2:22:38] and that's true. He says they were
[2:22:40] walled up people and they were so big
[2:22:42] till we look like grasshopper to them.
[2:22:44] That's true. But you see that 10 of them
[2:22:48] were theologians.
[2:22:52] They were looking at what they could see
[2:22:54] intellectually.
[2:22:57] But Joshua and Caleb were looking at the
[2:23:00] promises of God.
[2:23:03] And I and it says God said, "I've
[2:23:05] already gi you the land. Go
[2:23:09] take it. Hallelujah. That's what the
[2:23:12] matter with the people tonight in divine
[2:23:15] healing and everything. It's yours.
[2:23:20] Go take it.
[2:23:23] Is anything too hard for the Lord?
[2:23:26] I'm here to tell you nothing is too
[2:23:29] hard.
[2:23:31] Yes, we are living in human bodies,
[2:23:35] but there's a seed gene inside of you
[2:23:38] that is unstoppable.
[2:23:42] So, take courage. Take courage.
[2:23:45] All is well.
[2:23:48] Satan can put so much opposition against
[2:23:51] you.
[2:23:53] The boy was dead, but all is well.
[2:23:58] Shalom. May shalom fill your heart. May
[2:24:02] you put every worry aside, every cast
[2:24:05] down reasoning
[2:24:10] and act according to the word of God.
[2:24:13] Get
[2:24:14] your promise. Get your blessing because
[2:24:18] there's power in the name of Jesus.
[2:24:22] You know the name of Jesus
[2:24:24] still delivers.
[2:24:28] The name of Jesus still raises the dead.
[2:24:32] If you could only realize
[2:24:35] when Jesus was pronounced for the first
[2:24:37] time,
[2:24:40] it brought a baby back to life.
[2:24:44] He can bring life to you tonight.
[2:24:48] In your heart, in your backbone, in your
[2:24:50] hips, in your lungs, in your kidneys,
[2:24:55] you name it. Brother David, we've heard
[2:24:58] it before. Don't give me that excuse.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; We've heard many things before, but
[2:25:05] let's act like real soldiers of God,
[2:25:08] sons and daughters of God
[2:25:10] that know and who THEY BELIEVE, THAT
[2:25:13] KNOW THEIR GOD,
[2:25:15] AND THAT will do exploits.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; This is our season. This is our time.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; You're not going to need it in a
[2:25:24] millennium,
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; but he is here.
[2:25:27] to give you what you have need of. So
[2:25:31] may God bless you tonight
[2:25:34] and take
[2:25:36] what is yours.
[2:25:39] Take possession.
[2:25:41] If I'm standing here and I'm saying take
[2:25:44] the book,
[2:25:47] somebody has to come and take the book.
[2:25:49] It's yours.
[2:25:52] The book is open
[2:25:55] but it's yours.
[2:25:58] Revelation then 8 continues go and you
[2:26:01] take the book. So there's a part we have
[2:26:04] to do saints.
[2:26:07] Just go to him and say here I am
[2:26:12] and you will see all is well.
[2:26:16] These are not my words saints. These are
[2:26:19] God's word because with God all is well.
[2:26:23] Can we sing that song? There is power in
[2:26:25] the name of Jesus
[2:26:28] to break every chain,
[2:26:30] to break every bondage,
[2:26:33] to break everything that is contrary to
[2:26:36] the word of God.
[2:26:40] Do you believe that
[2:26:42] Jesus the name above all names?
[2:26:47] The name by whom we are saved.
[2:26:50] The name that cast
[2:26:52] every devil out.
[2:26:59] I can hear a mighty noise of change
[2:27:02] being dropped down. I can hear the
[2:27:05] CHAINS FALLING. WHY? Because there's a
[2:27:08] son and there's a daughter of God
[2:27:11] CLAIMING GOD'S GIVEN PRIVILEGES. ALL IS
[2:27:15] WELL. SO GET IT. TAKE IT.
[2:27:19] OH, in the name of Jesus.
[2:27:26] There is power
[2:27:30] in the name of Jesus.
[2:27:36] Oh, there is power
[2:27:41] in the name of Jesus
[2:27:47] to break every chain. Oh, break every
[2:27:51] chain. Oh, break every chain.

[2:28:14] in the name of Jesus.
[2:28:20] There is power
[2:28:25] in the name of Jesus
[2:28:31] to break every chain.
[2:28:34] Oh, break every chain. Oh, break every
[2:28:38] chain.
[2:28:42] To break every chain.
[2:28:45] Oh, break every chain.

[2:28:53] And there's an army
[2:28:56] that's right.

[2:29:07] that's right.
[2:29:14] Oh, there.
[2:29:17] And she's right.
[2:29:20] ing
[2:29:25] to break every chain. Don't break every
[2:29:28] chain.
[2:29:30] Don't break every chain.
[2:29:35] Oh, there's a rising
[2:29:38] sheing
[2:29:42] up.
[2:29:46] Oh, there she
[2:29:49] is right.
[2:29:56] Oh, we
[2:30:00] rise
[2:30:02] Jesus.
[2:30:07] So break every chain.
[2:30:10] Break every chain.
[2:30:13] Break every chain.

[2:50:09] Like Sarah, like she changed.
[2:50:13] I will change.
[2:50:15] I'm going to change.
[2:50:18] I will change like
[2:50:23] I will change.
[2:50:26] I will change.
[2:50:28] I'm going to change.
[2:50:30] like silver chains.
[2:50:33] Oh, when the spirit of the Lord falls
[2:50:37] upon my heart, I'm going to walk like
[2:50:42] walk.
[2:50:44] Oh, in the spirit of the Lord,
[2:50:48] my heart. I'm going to walk on the wall.
[2:50:54] I will walk.
[2:50:57] I will walk.
[2:51:00] I'm going to walk. I can not walk.
[2:51:05] I'm going to walk.
[2:51:08] I'm going to walk.
[2:51:10] I'm going to walk like
[2:51:15] I'm going to walk.
[2:51:18] I'm going to walk.
[2:51:21] I'm going to walk like he
[2:51:25] want.
[2:51:34] Hallelujah.
[2:51:36] HALLELUJAH.
[2:51:37] WHAT WAS HE NOT DOING? HE JUST KEPT
[2:51:40] WALKING.
[2:51:50] Could it be that next step, brother?
[2:51:52] &gt;&gt; Could it BE THAT NEXT STEP, SISTER?
[2:51:54] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO walk
[2:51:57] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to change.
[2:52:02] &gt;&gt; And I want all hell to know I AM THE
[2:52:06] UNSTOPPABLE SEAT.
[2:52:08] &gt;&gt; AND ALL IS WELL.
[2:52:12] &gt;&gt; I'M A WALK.
[2:52:14] I'M UNSTOPPABLE.
[2:52:16] I'M GONNA DANCE BECAUSE I'M UNSTOPPABLE.
[2:52:18] I'M GONNA PRAY BECAUSE I'M UNSTOPPABLE.
[2:52:21] I'M GONNA SING BECAUSE I'M UNSTOPPABLE.
[2:52:24] I'M GOING PRAISE BECAUSE I'M
[2:52:26] UNSTOPPABLE.
[2:52:30] Let every devil in hell know you ain't
[2:52:33] stopping this.
[2:52:38] Oh no. Oh no. You're not going to stop
[2:52:42] us.
[2:52:46] Every devil in hell has come against
[2:52:48] you,
[2:52:50] &gt;&gt; but you're still here.
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; I woke up in the middle of the night the
[2:52:55] other night. I thought, "What in the
[2:52:57] world is going on?" That devil keeps
[2:53:00] attacking, brother Ron. It keeps
[2:53:02] attacking, brother Matthew. IT KEEPS IT
[2:53:05] KEEPS ON,
[2:53:06] &gt;&gt; but it don't have enough power to keep
[2:53:08] on keeping on.
[2:53:11] BUT MY JESUS,
[2:53:13] MY JESUS HAS ALWAYS KEPT ON. HE'S RIGHT
[2:53:16] ON TIME. HE'S PERFECT IN HIS WAYS. MY
[2:53:19] GOD IS UNSTOPPABLE.
[2:53:22] &gt;&gt; So therefore, if he's unstoppable,
[2:53:25] I am unstoppable.
[2:53:28] &gt;&gt; That's my title.
[2:53:30] I'm unstoppable.
[2:53:34] &gt;&gt; I love when they ask at the bank,
[2:53:35] "What's your title?"
[2:53:37] NEXT TIME I go in the bank and they ask
[2:53:39] me what my title is, I won't say it's
[2:53:42] Mr. Andrew Spencer. WHAT WOULD THEY DO,
[2:53:45] SISTER APRIL, IF I WALKED INTO YOUR BANK
[2:53:46] AND SAID, "I AM MR. UNSTOPPABLE.
[2:53:50] I'M NOT SUPERMAN. I'M NOT IT'S NOT A
[2:53:52] BIRD. It's not a plane. But it IS ANDREW
[2:53:54] SPENCER, THE UNSTOPPABLE SON OF GOD.
[2:54:00] They may not GIVE ME A MILLION DOLLARS,
[2:54:02] BUT I GOT A FATHER.
[2:54:05] I GOT A FATHER.
[2:54:10] &gt;&gt; BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS.
[2:54:13] &gt;&gt; Somebody want to lift up their voice.
[2:54:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:54:32] That's just like the message of the
[2:54:33] hour.
[2:54:35] &gt;&gt; It keeps getting better and better.
[2:54:37] &gt;&gt; That's just like the Lord Jesus, isn't
[2:54:39] it?
[2:54:41] &gt;&gt; Mercy, Jesus.
[2:54:43] &gt;&gt; What a meeting tonight.
[2:54:46] &gt;&gt; Well, I told you it's going to be
[2:54:47] special.
[2:54:50] &gt;&gt; Well, you just said that. No, I was
[2:54:52] talking to the Lord.
[2:54:55] &gt;&gt; You know what? He talks back to me
[2:54:57] sometimes.
[2:54:59] &gt;&gt; Guess what? He delivered.
[2:55:09] Brother,
[2:55:11] I'm torched, man. I am torched.
[2:55:16] Y'all better watch out.
[2:55:19] &gt;&gt; We got one way to go.
[2:55:21] &gt;&gt; Y'all go ahead and get the signals
[2:55:23] ready. Get the countdown going on. We're
[2:55:25] going up.
[2:55:27] &gt;&gt; I got a fire underneath this rocket.
[2:55:31] And we ain't feeding it no hay.
[2:55:35] &gt;&gt; We ain't feeding it no more horse and
[2:55:37] mule feed.
[2:55:38] &gt;&gt; There's only one thing for this rocket
[2:55:40] and that's the message of the hour.
[2:55:43] &gt;&gt; So I got good news. If your fuel if your
[2:55:46] fire is just barely burning, don't you
[2:55:48] worry. The message got everything you
[2:55:50] need.
[2:55:51] &gt;&gt; WE GOT A PREACHER ALL THE WAY FROM
[2:55:52] SWITZERLAND that's got that high octane
[2:55:55] rocket fuel. He going to dump more in
[2:55:57] there tomorrow morning.
[2:56:05] Woo!
[2:56:07] Glory, glory.
[2:56:10] God bless you, brother David. Ain't it
[2:56:13] good to have a King David in the house?
[2:56:17] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:56:19] &gt;&gt; That's a king back there.
[2:56:21] &gt;&gt; That ain't the king of Switzerland, BUT
[2:56:23] THAT'S A KING and a priest from the most
[2:56:25] high God.
[2:56:26] &gt;&gt; Ain't it good to have a king in the
[2:56:27] house?
[2:56:31] Amen.
[2:56:33] Well, God bless you, Brother David.
[2:56:34] We're going to be praying for you and
[2:56:36] God gives you exactly what we need.
[2:56:39] &gt;&gt; Pour in more. Pour in more. I love it.
[2:56:42] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, this message ain't no
[2:56:44] paint and fire, is it?
[2:56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to let you be
[2:56:48] dismissed and want you go out reverently
[2:56:50] respectful. We got the choirs that are
[2:56:52] going to be staying after. And just be
[2:56:54] very mindful the presence of the Lord is
[2:56:56] here. So, we want to be mindful as we're
[2:56:58] dismissing. I know that some of you will
[2:56:59] be staying. So, but keep that in mind as
[2:57:01] you're dismissing tonight. We want to
[2:57:03] keep that same atmosphere where the
[2:57:05] presence of God can come and deal with
[2:57:07] us even more. We're going to let you be
[2:57:09] dismissed at this time. You can be
[2:57:11] seated as the musicians play something
[2:57:13] softly as the choir, the adult choir
[2:57:15] makes their way this this afternoon. God
[2:57:17] bless you. You're dismissed.
[2:59:00] Heat. Heat.
