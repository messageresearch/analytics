over every circumstance you are lord over every situation you are lord over every question in our lives you are lord over every impossibility and lord there were many impossibilities lord that were read lord in the form of a prayer request but it's not an impossibility to you it is an impossibility to man so father we bring these requests to you you are the great jehovah you are jehovah jireh you have all you have provided all that we have need of when abraham one day lord he took up his only son he took up isaac and he got everything ready and he was in need of a sacrifice he was ready to offer up his son because he knew you had a promise that that would come that seed would come through him but lord you he needed a sacrifice and lord when he needed that sacrifice there was that realm an impossibility lord that was caught in the thicket by his horns and lord we serve the same god and lord jesus we know that there's nothing impossible with you we ask now lord jesus your blessings over these requests lord i lay mine worthy hand father lord but it's not my hands it is you father it is not lord us within our humanity it's not even the doctors but it's you working through the

little while [Music] is [Music] [Applause] officers yes it's good to be here this morning well i was alone an idol and i was a sinner too but i heard a voice from heaven say there's work to do so i took the master's hand and i joined the christian band now i'm on the battlefield [Music] and i promised him that land i had the grace [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for my lord [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but i heard a voice from heaven he said there was work to do so i took the master's hand and i adored the christians oh i promise oh [Music] [Music] [Music] so i'm on the battlefield for my lord [Applause] you would think that we orchestrate these things brother matt said he was wanting to sing that this morning he said but boy she did a better job than i ever hallelujah i am so honored to have brother wayne with us today i i think a whole lot of his ministry and i just can't say it publicly but i i'm a fan and uh let's just let it be like that i'm a fan i i love what god's doing and he's got his saved his best for the last and no disregard to any other man but he saved his best for the last and i feel like brother wayne's one of them and so amen we're so honored to have he and his wife and and their children with us brother zach and you guys and we're just thrilled to see the miracle that happened there with that baby thrilled to be a part of that amen and so we're just thankful for that and amen and just isaac and bethany and being a part of their wedding last year and and uh it was just phenomenal for me to be there and so we thank you for having us there and uh god allowed me to put a little portion about your ministry in the wedding so god's doing great things he's doing absolute great things so good to see each and every one of you and we certainly love you with all of our hearts and uh i was so thrilled to see what god did last night that angelic presence had just dropped down in the room and you be aware that he's here he's already here now and and uh but uh i wanted to make a couple statements to you just before we walked brother wayne would come and we have one more couple more songs that's going to become but you know a man is known by his friends that's how you know a man and you are his wife and he reflects the character of himself by his wife and so then then you know him by his by the friends that he has and and i can look around and i've got some pretty special friends yesterday brother david showed up at my house with sister faith and and he was carrying this and he's been listening to the sermons it's a boxing glove not just a boxing glove it's a sugar ray leonard boxing glove now for the kernel side of me i was a fan and when i saw it i it represented a lot of things for me i've got a heavyweight boxing belt champion thank you brother vijay wherever you're at now i've got a glove and so i i took it when i saw it that god's not done with me yet amen and i remind you that we never never give up and there's absolutely no retreat and we're ready we're ready in the moment there's not a day off or not a week off uh we're ready we're responsive we're we're on the mark brother i'm gonna use that term on the mark we have a mission to finish and fight it until the day that he chooses to call us home the scripture says that i can do all things through christ it strengthens me it also tells us to press the mark that's just not for me but that's for every person sitting in this building you know sometimes but we're challenged to sit like a spectator and watch and as long as you're a spectator the devil's all right with that but the moment that you start waving your hands and you start testifying and worshiping god all hell turns loose but remember greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world there's times when we want to say no moss no more i quit i walk away i can't handle the pressure it's an urge every champion has felt it every prophet even jesus himself cried in the in the garden brother branham wanted to get away he wanted to go to the mountains every president has felt the urge to quit every king has felt the urge every line has felt it every winner has felt it every soldier has felt it every victorious person has felt it the urge to quit but it's not in our dna maybe in our natural man it's in our dna when we get enough we've got enough and we want to walk away but god put something on the inside of you and he procrastinated it there and he pre-planned it there that you will not quite the statement that i said a few couple years ago i've been sick before but i made it i've been broke before but i made it i've been broken hearted before but i made it i have cried all night long but i made it i have been betrayed but i made it i have been lied on but i made it i've been left destitute but i made it i've been rejected but i made it the theme of this whole thing is we're going to make it hallelujah you know we're looking at it now and we can see because we've had the prophet our prophet has given us pro prophetic vision the world is falling apart fear's wrecking our nations it's wrecking the world but we're watching it with confidence and courage we could have just weeks left to preach and weeks left and let me just say if that's what we've got left let's do it with all of our might the scripture tells us that no weapon that is formed against this shall prosper and every tongue that shall arise against thee in the judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord the righteousness of god of is of me saith the lord and i finish with this being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ god just don't get in inside of his project and quit our god's not a quitter he is not in crisis he called you to put on the glove brother david and sister faith i i want you to come and sing for us this morning and bless us in song both of you same couple amen and then we've got a masterpiece that's getting ready to come forth and are you ready to have church won't you just turn to your neighbor said today we're going to have church boot up just go ahead and scream it out while they're getting ready we'll give that devil knock out punch for the ron it's good to be here i've been sailing against life's terrible contrary wills sometimes the heaviest lives but though i'm reeling and rocking i'm a few waves from darken i'm still sailing in spite of the storms is [Music] till it whispers we still and if i have to hold on to right out these ways [Music] [Music] my old compass is [Music] that old boat's never failing as i'm sailing my vessel by faith through the thick of the funk i'll wait for the sound of the horns raining [Music] in spite of [Music] is [Music] whispers [Music] and if i have to hold on to write out this place [Music] spain is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] you were there [Music] you were my friends and you believe [Music] through the good times i felt that you were all i had you were my friends [Music] you went the extra mile to prove your love was true [Music] [Applause] you could away turn it back to all my sins for me you gave your life [Music] you chose to be my friend like a child so for you you stood by my side help me you were my friend [Music] you believed [Music] when my faith is [Music] he took me by the hands and led [Music] to prove your love [Music] when you could have walked away [Music] for me you gave [Music] you chose to be my friend [Music] when you could have walked away [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] hallelujah aren't you thankful that he chose to be your friend you know it's always uh it's always stuck out to me how amazing that the word of god says in hebrews

always a real honor to be here and our family to be with us so we just want to bring you all greetings in the name of the lord if we maybe just bow our hearts this morning for a word of prayer gracious lord we are certainly an honor to stand here and speak to your people lord what i deemed to be lord the greatest class of people on the earth your children lord those that you have given your blood for now lord as we speak this morning to them we pray it may your grace and may your mercy move here in this room lord we have invited you you have come among us lord and we're asking you that you've just sit with us a while as we go through your word this morning lord may you direct it to the heart to the lie father we ask you lord that you would give us the words the grace the mercy to speak father now lord as we move into this realm of your word we give you the first place here lord before this congregation before lord those who are watching this morning i want to acknowledge our weakness and our inability and lord we want to make sure lord to know that if any good thing done it's you lord and we'll give you the praise and the honor and the glory you come and take the service now lord we invite you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen and god bless you if you have your bibles this morning i'd like to turn it into the book of daniel i just want to look here again in the 11th chapter we pray we've just stay on this direction with the spirit and give us mercy daniel 11 and verse 32 if you put more in that i'll con i can control it from here you can over put it there and you know i don't have a job for the government it's an ear monitor you can relax in daniel 11 and 32 and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall be corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their god shall be strong and do exploits amen we ask the lord to bless his word you may be seated i want to speak to you just a little bit this morning from this uh portion of scripture and if i would take a title here i want to talk to you about the strength for war about the strength for war i uh in studying this scripture we've we've moved through it extensively over the last few months just the lord just dealing with us and taking us back and forth it's amazing how brother branham says one scripture can tie the entire bible and it's it's the truth it just it just keeps uh bringing forth and unfolding and it's been a real a real personal a moment for me in the study of this scripture of daniel and to identify uh that it is the it is something that actually belongs to the bride of christ to know this is actually the season of the fulfillment of this word of the people that do know their god shall be strong and do great exploits let me read something from the feast of trumpets that brother branham will say it a little differently and i as i study brother branham a lot of times i like to listen to how he rewords a scripture and when brother brown rewords a scripture he's not changing it but he's bringing a better a a better way of understanding it he's not trying to add or change it he's trying to give us the true meaning of what it's actually saying and he says of it in in jeffersonville here feast of trumpets he's saying uh that the people will not know the messiah unless they're in the word and he said now a people that believe in him how can they do it unless they're constantly in the word see to know what he is and daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish and the unwise wouldn't know now they shall know their god and how he shall appear in the last days to bring the people back to the word see so that the bride will know her husband he exchanges here the people shall know their god with the bride we'll know her husband to know her mate the revealed word see that's why this has to happen that's why this ministry had to happen was so that the scripture said the people shall know their god so jesus said in luke that in the day when the son of man is being revealed that that revealing would there would be a people on the earth that would come under that revealing that they would see it they would understand that that was god they would know it wasn't uh just saul saying or it wouldn't be some fantastic something but they would know that that was the manifestation of god among them amen now of course this is speaking of the end time if you go into the book of daniel and you go to the 12th chapter remember daniel has seen a mighty angel stand up and took the book he called him michael which is an exact a replica of daniel revelations the 10th chapter and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed and sealed until the time of the end and many shall be purified in white but the wicked shall do wickedly in my if we haven't seen when the when the book is opened amen it didn't change the wicked one bit they continued the same as they've always been the world is the same as it's always been and if you if you sometimes if you like to study these kind of things so happens the same time that the word is open to the church through a prophet that same time that's happening america is kicking the bible out of the public schools so the so the world has done a good charting of the increase of sin in america since 1963 it's a powerful chart if you've never saw them you go online and dr google can show them to you they're very powerful but the the charts of of sin almost it's almost like an exact point in 63 goes almost straight up because the opening of the word didn't help them at all the bible said line up online and precept upon precept here little and their little but see it did not profit them any therefore they fell backwards rather than it bringing something great it actually it actually caused another revival and satan actually took from that revival and went to the wicked but the bible said here the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand but the wise shall understand now i don't have time to preach in those things but if you go to matthew 25 there's a wise virgin there who is made ready by the voice of malachi 4 the knock it came at midnight and so you see now again in the time of the opening of that book this is daniel now 11 telling us the wise is going to understand it's not going to change the wicked at all but the wise now they're going to understand and recognizing acting on the word look at brother brahm said hearing recognizing acting on the word he says now it's promised by daniel that the people in these days when the stone hits the image in the foot the people shall know their god will do exploits now you know from daniel 2 that the stone that's hewed out the mountain that strikes the image of nebuchadnezzar in the feet that's the end time that's that's that's the message of the hour revelation coming into the age to strike the image of denomination and in the season that that strikes the earth in the season that the message comes there'll be people on the earth and they will do exploits now that word exploits can be changed or it can be defined in in separate ways but it mainly means action or it could mean a great military action it's a great action great exploit if you if you think about this maybe there's a a turkey hunting expo it's a it's where they are displaying the things that they have and they're trying to get someone to see it it's it's someone has something and they're displaying it so there's going to come a great display brother braham said prophecy after prophecy seminaries in the world can't take it out of it god's going to do it anyhow because somebody's going to follow it see amen according to revelations 10 that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of god will be finished do you see that the mystery of god will be finished in that day the day of the voice of the seventh angel now i often like to say it to be sure everybody knows what i'm talking about i believe the seventh angel is a man named william branham and that seventh angel is the same seventh angel of revelation chapter three who was the seventh angel to the laodicean church and he brought the last message he was the seventh star in the right hand of him amen do you see then that at that time it's the last star it's the end time message it's the ending of the ages it's the end of gentile dispensations you'll be the last message that comes the people that hear that message the mystery of god will be finished to those people brother branham said see what it is it'll be god the hope of glory shining forth in the baptism of the holy ghost when these things begin to take place time is going to be no more they said they will know their god daniel said this that many will run to and fro and knowledge will be increased but they that know their god shall do great exploits they shall do exploit see the mystery of god will be finished and somebody will be living in the season to hear the message of that seventh angel and those people that hear that message will know their god they will understand that's god talking to them like the woman at the well not theologians not people who are great doctors of divinity but simple people saw the manifestation of god and had something in their heart to say that's god they didn't call it the devil they didn't call it some beos above something in them said that's god that's god dealing with us that's god manifesting himself and the people that live and know that that's god them same people will do exploit same in other words the action of the word will come into their lives because you have received it as god then it'll put you in an action amen according to the ephesian age brother ephesians church age brother of america said this that daniel heard the seven thunders that's what daniel heard was the seven thunders that's exactly what happened in revelation chapter 10 when the book was being opened seven thunders began to utter their voice what was it it was ending the mystery of god in the season of the seventh angel brother branham said when he comes he'll guide you to it that's the reason of these coming seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of god would be finished to know who god is what he is how he lives his nature his being it's all supposed to be way up here at that time to bring us into the full statures of the sons and daughters of god a church that's washed in the blood of jesus christ he's bringing the manifestation of the church in order with this seventh angel amen brother bam says it like this when the seventh seal is broken the mystery of god that's been sealed in the mysterious seals will be finished and we know this morning that the seventh seal was open years ago amen this is a historical event from the message what's the attraction on the mountain he said what was prophecy today is history and that's what this attraction is about is about what god has done and the church has been gathered in by the manifestation of god amen it is solved it out the mystery has been solved out and it's gathered a people to an end time message who is feeding on the word body of the son of man bringing the strength of the son of man into their lives bringing the strength of the resurrection power into their ministries and their lives now according to abraham's covenant we are living in the season when the covenant of god will come into full strength now god released a covenant to the church and it's been under covenant for 2 000 years but that covenant never realized its full power or the fullness of its strength uh maybe i could just say it to you in this way brother madam explains it and he talks about in the days of abraham when abraham made a covenant unto god and he laid him on the altar that he divided the the beast that was laid there and you remember brother ma'am says but when abraham saw the vision he saw the beast tore in half there was a white light came down in between the beast he said now that was a covenant between god and man and god was confirming the covenant with abraham genesis 15. brother man said what it is it's like a man makes a covenant now we might shake a hand or something but he said in the old testament what they would do is they would tear a beast in half and speak the covenant over a torn body he said and if you didn't keep it you would be as that torn body but brother branham says but see what it was speaking of was the body of jesus christ his corporal body would be brought to the earth and hung on calvary and it would be ripped apart in the crucifixion and he said that would be god's covenant with mankind would be that body the broken body of jesus christ he said now he took that body and took it into heaven and set it in power so that body is sitting there today he said but then he took the spirit out of that body and sent it back to the church so that we are in covenant with god he said god's part of the covenant is the body he said our part of the covenant is the spirit so at the season you're living that covenant is to come into its full strength what has been here in a measure through the ages will come into a full strength in the last days this is the season of the fullness of the display of almighty god we have been brought into a full strength when the covenant is confirmed amen what is it what was in john wesley amen what was in martin luther what was in pentecost those things amen god never lost nothing what was in luther collected in john wesley collected in pentecost and every bit of that has been gathered together in the seed of the bride of jesus christ we are not here this morning wishing we were back in the days of martin luther or john wesley this bride has everything they had and it's been collected together this morning for the fullness of god to dwell bodily in the church of the living god amen i'll tell you this this is the season when the entire plant has given strength under the seed the seed is in possession of everything good that has been throughout the church ages this is a season when strength is coming like it's never been strength has been poured into the church like never before the strength of exposition of the power of almighty god when i read this i find that the bible again if you reflect to daniel 11 it said the people that know their god shall be strong the people that know their god shall be strong when them seals were opening they were loosening something to dwell into the church of the living god we have not received god in weakness we have received him in the strength and the anointing and the power of the very god of all creation we are not serving a weak god this morning we have not received a message that come to us in weakness it did not come to us in theology but it came in the power and the manifestation and the vindication of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever we have received a ministry from god as it said in the book of second corinthians the fourth chapter he said because of this ministry we think not because we have received this word we are not feigning this morning we are not barely getting by this morning we are not trying amen to rise up but god has gave strength back to the church of the living god now the strength that she's received is the strength of the lord i think of david of old a little small fellow but he had a lot of strength he had a strength and the bible said and the lord is the strength and he is my shield amen in the 8th verse of psalms 28 for the lord is their strength and he is the saving strength of the anointed in psalms 27 and 1 he said the lord is the light of my salvation of whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life i'll tell you that's rapture material right there amen the only way to get strength to change your body is your strength has got to come from the lord the strength of god is coming into the church the strength of our life i think about the blessing of a man when his strength comes from the lord in psalms 84 verses 5 and 7 david said blessed is the man whose strength is in thee who passing through the valley of baca make it as a way on the rain filleth the pools they go from strength unto strength everyone that appears before god they go from strength under strength amplified version says it better they go from victorious power to victorious power amen what is it they are not going backwards they are increasing in strength they are increasing in victory now i know some people say to me all the time so brother wayne worrying is you seeing an increase of strength in the church we've been moving along here for a couple years and it seems like maybe we're getting a little weaker but we're not maybe somebody thinks this morning that you're at the end of your rope but you thought that two years ago you thought that two years and the church has come through the hardest times that it has ever come through in its ages now now now the church in general we've come through coved never happened in the history of the church amen pastors are passing and they're they're pastoring in the most divisive age that has ever come leadership at an all-time low religion amen has come to the place where it respects nothing even in our own even in our own message some of the leaders who who were around the families amen started saying that there's no place for ministry in the churches and we just need to play tapes our pastors are fighting the hardest season that has ever been in the history of the church they're fighting all hell he meant but two years ago we thought that maybe we couldn't make it another time another service but you know what where we are two years later we're two years later and here we're standing and i say today we're standing stronger now than we were two years ago i say this church is stronger right now than it's ever been in the history of the church amen we are more stable we are more established we are more able for the battle than we have ever been in the history of the world i tell you i don't know how to say it but the best way i know how to say it is brother once in a while i just pull it out and i say satan i'm still here you threw kovac at us and we're still here you stood cancer at my brother but we're still here you've through division you're through wars and rumors of ours but you can't stop us it ain't gonna be you ain't gonna shut this bride up you ain't gonna stop this bride god's gonna rapture this pride he's gonna take her off of the earth in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we're not here this morning just barely making it by the grace of god this is a march of victory we are a victorious church marching into the glories of god i have a prophecy here that says that you will know your god and you'll be strong amen no wonder it said in the book of joshua be thou strong and of good courage for god hath given you this land i'll tell you amen i'm i'm the guy i like to go back and read and see who it is saying it david says it strength david talks about the strength and i thought my david must have had some examples to be able to say there was strength then there's victorious power and i got to looking back and and looking at who in the world would have been the the examples of this man david well of course caleb is one of his greatest examples caleb in the in the time of david wouldn't have been that old since they heard of what caleb did and caleb was a man who was 85 years old had been looking for the promises for 40 years he had been sitting there waiting on the rest of the church to get catch up with him and caleb remember this at 85 years old went to my joshua and said when i was 45 he said moses made a promise to me that i could have the land of hebron and here i am 85 years old and i'm a strong today for the battle as i was come on now he might not been as strong as he was he may have had been a little weaker he may have got around a little more feeble amen things might have been a little different around the house he might have needed a pair of glasses amen we don't know what his physical body but for the war for the strength to fight the battle he said i'm more strong now than i've ever been and i'll tell you something this morning amen that caleb is an anointing that represents the bride of jesus christ brother branham said it very clearly he said in the last day there will be two great anointings joshua and caleb he said joshua will be a man a representative of the end time messenger and caleb will represent those that follow that message now it is noteworthy to know the only people that went in the land was the follower of the message it will take the spirit of caleb to enter this land only caleb went in only caleb followed joshua the rest of them had to be raised the rest of the generation that went in was raised under that spirit and tonight we were today we recognize that the strength amen for caleb's fight has come to the bride of jesus christ i believe we're at our season i believe we bypass the 40 years of waiting the years of toil waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength and i believe the waiting is over i believe it's the season of the church we have the saith the lord this is now thus saith the lord the move is on for the bride now wonder no wonder express that the mighty angel come out of heaven in revelation 10 he's the strong one come out of heaven with a book in his hand the way he would share his strength is through the revelation and the anointing of the word of god god is sharing the strength of the mighty one today and we're feeding on the body word of the son of man according to revelations 12 in the time of that great angelic battle that become a human battle in the season whenever satan is going to be cast out of heaven what's the bible say it said now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god has become the kingdom of our christ for the accuser of the brethren is cast down now we know satan is not cast down until this bride goes up but with every ascension of you in your position with god it is a warfare with satan and it's driving him out of the position that god hath anointed you to be him you have been anointed for authority you've been anointed for power the sons and the daughters of the most high god satan has been trying to hold your position but god has given to you now salvation and strength that they may overcome him by the blood of the lamb the word of testimony for they loved not their lives unto death look at that they wasn't scared it's not a scared people and i say it fits you this fits this bride very well it's a perfect size this scripture fits this church very well they were not afraid of death they were not afraid of the battle they were not afraid of what was facing them they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony those people that do know god will be strong and they will have action they'll do exploits exploits means actions you know what brother branham said to this church he said the first church that come off of that vine was a pentecostal church with the gifts and they were really if it ever puts out another branch they'll write another book of acts behind it and that's the way they had it in the days of the apostles and the apostolic age has never ended i say that there's one book in the bible that's not finished it's the book of acts and we are continuing that book today and i believe there's a bright chapter in that book amen i'll tell you what at times i think ron spencer's got a whole chapter dedicated to himself amen amen all the things that you've went through and battled through and the testimonies that god's given you that'd be a section little section in there about the exploits of a man named ron spencer amen but i tell you this today it's not just brother ron he's got a group behind him he's got ministry sitting with him he's got a lovely wife that supports him i know things are troubled in every way but there is spiritual food in due season for the hour that we're living in it's a continuation revelation that jesus christ in the churches book he said remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts that's right amen what is it a people going to follow this they're going to have an action the word exploit in one word means a maneuver a large-scale military exercise of troops and warships and other forces isn't it something to know that the exploits that is spoken of concerning you will be a military effort that you are the church of the living god but you are warriors every one of you every man woman child every elder every young person you are a warrior i thought of it such as in israel they live in such a realm that where the muslims are constantly trying to push them out everybody has to go to the army everybody has to fight and let me say today as the church of the living god not one of you is in a place where you won't have to war not one of you is in a place where you won't have to make a decision to war against the enemy that we are fighting let me say this i believe i believe there's a great exercise going on today i believe there's a church that's moving into the realms of the holy ghost do you know the canaan land that was typed in the book of joshua is not the millennium the canaan land is a age of overcoming the promised land of the holy ghost and the overcomers that go into that land we are not fighting for a natural land we are fighting for a spiritual land and the promises that lay in that land that belong to us we've got to go get them now if it's a if it's a symbol and we're going to look back in the shadows in the days of joshua and caleb when they went to look they saw the land just like moses said it was he said it was grapes and it was milk and it was honey and it was like those grapes were so big amen they had to get they had to get poles to haul them back took two men to haul back a cluster of grapes and when they got back with them amen them bunch of silly spies amen that was looking at the conditions of the land begin to say hey look it's got milk and honey just like god said but we can't take the land we're not able to do it we're a bunch of grasshoppers and there's a bunch of giants over there and we're not able to do it but here's the milk and honey that is there here's the greats it's a proof of what god said was there now brother branham took that and he said see that milk and honey was an evidence of that other land it was an evidence he said but there's giants in the land so it's up to you are you going to let a giant stop you are you going to take the evidence and say that land belongs to us it's up to you it's up to what are you going to look at this morning are you going to look at the giants are you going to see the evidence of the land and go take the land i'll tell you with everything there is a war with every promise that god made there's a war and there's a giant for that land there's a giant living there there's a giant that you're going to destroy brother man said divine healing he said is a is a promise that's in this land but there's giants in the land of divine healing but we have enough evidence this morning to stand here all day long and tell you that divine healing is the truth and every giant that is raised up in that land listen i want y'all to know something today our giants are not giants like they were in the days of joshua our giants are scarecrows they're already defeated they're already defeated this morning our giants cannot defeat you unless you fear them that's the only hope they have but there's a church who knows their god who knows their promises and they will not back out of the promise because of a giant that makes a difference what you're looking at i'll tell you what brother branham said about it i thought it was powerful i was reading here the other day in the book a message called exodus brother bram said they come back with that milk and honey he said the evidence of that land and when they got back with it he said oh my he said that make us up a good pentecostal cocktail amen now some of you probably never lived a life to know what a cocktail was but i happened to not have the same testimony i knew what cocktails were and and i knew people mix things up and and a good cocktail is one that'll intoxicate you a little bit and brother madam was saying the evidences they had should have intoxicated the church of the living god and the milk and honey that has come out of that land in our generation brother we are to be the drunkest crowd on the face of the earth there shouldn't be a sober person in the church of the living god we ought to be drunk with the intoxication of the power of the holy ghost that's been seen in this age oh i tell you what if you want to get a little bit drunk just pick up a couple of testimonies of how god saved ron spencer out of the fire and just start drinking and after a little while you feel like dancing and thinking about what a mighty god that we serve what about that god that we saw raised ken boyer up out there in calgary in order to intoxicate you what about the the grace our brother robert douglas the other day spent months in the hospital they did a trach surgery took him off i mean he was at the bottom of the bottom amen took him months amen and went into a rehab and last sunday morning i preached to him at the church he come in and sat down amen in order to intoxicate the church to know there's some giants in the land [Applause] but there's some milk and honey in the land too and if the church begins to drink of the cocktail of the milk and honey of god it will intoxicate them to make them look at things differently than they used to you know brother brown tells a story about this same area he says it like this he said there was a fellow over the ymca the other day he said no drunk fell down in the in the in the in the road he said he fell down out there he said we picked him up and he said i think it was no salvation army he said they picked him up and somebody said are you going to take him over to the doctor for hypothermia he passed out in the street and it's about 30 something degrees out there and brother brother graham said the fella said oh no he said there's no need to take him to the doctor he said the man's so intoxicated he said that his blood is running with alcohol you couldn't freeze him if you wanted to he said you know i think that the church ought to get a little back he said in these cold conditions that we're in today i think if we get intoxicated with the power of god you couldn't freeze the church out you can't freeze out the church of the living god things are getting cold but the church is drinking from the evidence of the revelation of the age that she's living in and the more she drinks the bigger she gets the more she drinks the stronger she gets i tell you she turns six foot tall and bulletproof brother she gets invincible amen and i believe today it's an invincible church the church of the living god amen i tell you what i've not chose to look at the giants i have chose to look at the evidences of god coming down in our meetings but the power of the holy ghost i think what we need is a drunk church i think they care less about the troubles and situations i think it would matter less of what happened in the church y'all know y'all know hey man best way to get along with the drunks get drunk with him maybe somebody in here is born thanks to a bunch of crazy people well if you as a drink and what eyes are drinking if you as a feeling when i'm a feeling if you're thinking the way i'm thinking i'm thinking about a god who could come down in a church and fill hearts and lies with the power of the holy ghost i might not be a sensible man but i'll tell you what i am i'm a free man i'm free of tradition i'm free of religion i'm free of sin god has filled me with the holy ghost and fire glory to god what an hour to live oh if we could see it right now there's an unfolding light moving down over the church a glory of his presence what you're going to look at that's what matters don't it it matters what you're looking at but the brand said that was the difference between joshua and caleb and the rest of the crowd what they looked at now they already had milk and honey when joshua come back he looked them giants over and he said there's our bread i got some he said them them giants are bred for us he had milk and honey he just needed some bread to go with it and to him the bread of the lamb was the giant because joshua was a warrior caleb was a warrior they were they were battle hungry they wanted an enemy they they needed to take their sword and defend the land they had something in them and let me say something to you they were typing you every one of you this morning sitting here as a as a battle warrior laying on the inside it's not the size of the dog that's in the fight it's the size of the fight that's in the dog and our great warrior joshua is in the heart of every believer this morning hey there's a man standing there with authority and with power and the giants of the land are bred under the church you want to feed some bread amen just start telling the testimonies of how you overcame and how you overcame and how you overcame you sit around the table and start telling them how god came into your life and conquered temptation how he conquered that disease i conquered this problem and after a while you fed you brought the bread to melchizedek you brought the bread to elohim after a little while something stares up on the inside of you a warrior awakens [Music] oh ain't nobody going in this but a joshua caleb and i tell you what about these guys they wasn't going to give their part up they wasn't going to give their pardon you wasn't going to force them out of it you weren't going to take it away from them amen and i feel the same this morning i tell you there's been a thousand devils reason up and tell us why we shouldn't go forward they've even made videos about us made videos about your pastor about any man of god nearly now they're putting videos out against us and they're charging at us against they didn't do that when i was a drunk it's got to be the devil when i was a drunk nobody preached against me nobody made videos against me but when god took me in his hand and started delivering hearts all of a sudden the devil said we better stop that guy we better get that guy stopped [Applause] i tell you what you better be careful if you're on the wrong side of it because you'll find out you're fighting against god's mighty men in the last days i know it's written in the bible but the bible is alive this morning it's not just a history book there are men sons and daughters of god who are walking the same trails believing the same word i know they're trying to stop us in every way but i'm not giving up my land i'm not giving up my land there's giants the further we get in this the more critics we're going to get the farther we move in the anointing the more people going to call it's pentecostal they're going to call us every name they can figure amen but they're going to have to do what they can do because i'm not going to quit i'm not going to stop matter of fact i'm going to pull my sword and cut through every philistine that has camped itself around the waters of the living god so what are you talking about by the way i'm talking about this i'm talking about we're not leaving our land we're not getting out of this land we're going to fight because a prophet said we could have it now that's what the prophet said do you know joshua was to give the land to the believers y'all know that you know they divided the land by lots and they and joshua gave them that land and once they were given that land according to what moses said those men had a right to fight anybody for them now i'm not going to teach on caleb this morning but it was amazing that caleb actually is a gentile and he's fighting for land that belongs to israel but he's been inducted in the army i studied down here a while back and i thought dear god what one of them tribes opened up and led a gentile dog into its tribe to bring see that's the problem with adoption back in that day that's why they didn't want ruth right because the inheritance would be corrupted by the gentile seedlings because if if if that land belonged to to the tribe then somebody moved into it they'd become an inheritor in the land and it was an eternal inheritance and here caleb as a gentile is moving into this land and i thought dear god who let that gentile into that land but if you keep reading the bible said that caleb was of the tribe of judah i said oh my goodness the tribe of judah that's the same tribe that let ruth in that's the same tribe amen that let that that little moabite come right into the tribe of judah what was it it's because that our jesus has come from the land the tribe of judah and made an access for every man woman or child to become the seed of abraham and as the seed of abraham we have acclaimed to the promises of abraham so when the prophet promises you something you got a right to fight for it now i'll tell you something right quick caleb had this promise given to him by moses and he knew his promise you know what to be honest to be to be fair caleb didn't have any deed to that land at all all he has what a prophet said somebody said well can you find that in the scripture he said well the prophet said it prophet said it see sometimes people they want more evidence than is necessary they want you to prove things to them that is settled with you prove to us well you can do these things i don't need to prove it to you [Applause] the prophet said it would happen the prophet said these people that know their god will do exploits no wonder they had to be battle men because every devil in hell is going to try to keep them out of this exercise they're going to try to move them off of those grounds but see he had what the prophet said about it now the problem with what the prophet said that gave caleb the land of hebron and anybody that studies knows knows that hebron was where the giants were the giants were there because that the biggest men in canaan took the best ground they fought and took the best the big giants is kind of like somebody says a guy seven foot fall seven foot four and weigh 342 pounds where does he sit where he wants to those giants lived where they wanted to and they were used to taking what they wanted doing what they wanted and nobody had strength to resist them because everybody was the same but when these men come over there they were a circumcised bunch they were the seed of abraham and there was a different strength that was in their life their strength was not in their in their genetics their strength was not in their bodies or in their muscles their strength was in the promises of jehovah god and they knew god said that you should possess the gates of your enemies and by that force and promise they could move upon their enemies amen now it's a beautiful it's a beautiful study and i'm not taking long in it but i will say that brother branham says joshua parallels ephesians in ephesians 1 and verse 11 paul said that we have obtained an inheritance now if you if you study that it's actually the only way obtained inherits the word inheritance is translated here in the greek differently than everywhere else in the greek inheritance and this word inheritance means divided by lots and it's amazing that a prophet would say ephesians parallels joshua and when paul uses the greek word he actually describes the dividing of our inheritance the same as it was done in the days of joshua they meant nowhere else is it inheritance described this way but it was something that was given to you by lot amen and an inheritance was given somebody said well i didn't do anything that's the point you are predestinated to an inheritance amen what was my inheritance brother wayne that your name was put on the lamb's book of life from before the foundation of the world therefore the blood of jesus did not save you brother adam said it kept you saved your inheritance was there before the world was here before there was sin there was a savior before you ever failed there was a blood in the mind of god that could get you back where you come from now adoption paragraph three brother brown said god chose us and let jesus come and pay the price the shedding of his blood so that no sin could be accounted to you for nothing nothing you do now i know that's hard on the legalist but my goodness what a power in the hand of a believer amen because every time you rise up to do something for god that's where the problem comes it's not what somebody else has done is what you've done and satan tries his best to cancel your authority and your power by bringing up your history or by bringing up your carnality or bringing up your humanity but a prophet is saying your inheritance that you would be assigned was before the world began and jesus paid the blood that the inheritance would stand true in this season so that satan could not attribute now you said what was my inheritance it's to be a son of god of course your inheritance is to be a son of god or a daughter of god see this inheritance is the sonship and that sonship means that you were made in the image of god can i just make it real simple here ye are gods jesus said it is written year of gods psalms 82 and 6 david said it ye are gods and of the children of the most high see you are little gods amateur gods in genesis 1 and 26 we were given dominion to rule this earth in our origin when god created us he created us in his image he was god of the universe and you were god of the earth but satan he came against that position and brought sin and held dominion over eve by her failures but jesus said i'm coming one day and i'm going to take it away from satan and oh my god in the garden of gethsemane he undone what satan done in the garden of eden and repossess the blessing of the church by the blood of jesus christ he put you heir to all of it so that he could say to you that you are the offsprings of almighty god you are amateur gods do you realize brother graham said this may choke you to death but men and women that are sons of god are amateur gods they're amateur gods he said we're waiting for the fullness of time later in the paragraph when the pyramid gets to the top when full sons of god will be manifested when the power of god will walk out hallelujah and take every power that satan has got away from him hey it belongs to him it belongs to you to take every power satan has away from him in adoption part four brother branham says it very clearly he was a low gospel of god that's true he was the son of god then he was made a little god isn't it beautiful that jesus came into our sphere from a big god to a little god brother adam said he was the first little god without sin he was a little god that came without sin that he might make the rest of you little gods sinless he took our sin upon him amen that he would be able to turn in our kind of body look at his disciples and say unto them i say unto you little gods whatsoever thing you say it shall be done as you have spoken it if you say unto this mountain be moved it shall be moved in the name of the lord you see how the devil's moved in on that promise you see how he's done that had to build a scarecrow around that so we've had people take off with that and feel impressed and they think something are to be that way so they just say it out and name it claim it and all that kind of thing that's not what a prophet was talking about they made a mockery out of that and put a giant in that land so as far as when somebody preaches it that people sitting in the congregations will draw back a little to figure out what he's talking about amen but i don't know about you but if god gave that to the church i believe we can possess that i believe the church can possess it this morning with the power of the spoken word now i have to say some things once in a while while i'm preaching i i will say this i'll say that not everybody in this church is going to probably speak a squirrel i don't believe maybe everybody in this church is going to speak a storm i i don't i don't really figure it will be that way my contention is not that every one of you is going to speak and create by the word my contention is the potential to do so is in every believer sitting in this building you cannot take it away from the church as a possession or as an inheritance because if god moves they meant from the child to an elder whether it be a preacher or a widow woman god can use the spoken word out of the mouth of children amen and now the mouth of babes god can use it i say unto you brother baby said little gods the manifestation of the sons of god when true sons bore sons they move field sons will speak and their word is backed my brother madam will tell us this in the days of the manifestation of the sons of god in israel in the church he said i believe there's a church on the road tonight a power of the living god where men will speak the word and it'll flash like lightning a church is coming out not a psychologist not some put on not some make-believe but a real true genuine anointed holy ghost god called church my when brother branham begins to declare this he's starting to show you that it's not a psychology it's not a mental workup it's the power of the living god jehovah jireh paragraph 63 mother man said now he has no eyes but mine and yours he has no hands but mine and yours he energizes us and brings forth life and it brings it through us whether it's preaching the gospel by lip or seeing the vision by eye wherever it is laying hands on the sick whatever it is it's christ working through the branches of his church every office literally electrified by his presence i'll tell you have you ever been in a service where you were just electrified with the electrifying presence of god just comes in the church and unctions of the power of god just moves to the being and the church is moved under the utterance and atmosphere of god where all things can take place where anything can happen i believe that's the kind of medium we're in this morning i believe anything could take place in this meeting i believe sons and daughters of god's setting under the atmosphere of faith anything could take place god sends a pulsation and the power of faith reaches out and things begin to change i believe things can change in one meeting i think believe things can change in one phrase amen right in one prayer line the lost and lies will change forever in a moment in just a moment in time when the spirit of the lord spoke to brother ron we are forever changed by that word that was spoken in that moment in time now you can't take that away from my family and say well that was just some little something or some psychologist or something like that we've got a baby we live with every day to remind us of the god that we serve is a reality and when i come to church i'm not coming to church just to entertain a religion or some kind of a tradition i have come to worship a god who could change anything anyway anytime anyplace amen you may have come here this morning and think everything is the way it is and it's always going to be that way but as a servant in the name of the lord i tell you that god can change this very morning your lives can change your hearts could change i believe it's a season of change i believe it's the hour to change i believe there's joshuas and caleb's rising up in this age getting ready amen you say well brother wayne that was the days of brother brown this is a different day well i tell you in in the message of the fifth seal brother bam says something and you've heard this quote for years he said i believe the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored and the glorious power of the creator i believe he can make a squirrel and he said here a man or woman missing a part that's a complete animal in itself he's telling you i believe the atmosphere and the way of the word coming in that you'll not be sitting in a service and a limb be restored on you that's why i don't know if that could happen we're supposed to be the rapturing bride we are believing that our bodies will be changed from our toes to our head how much easier would it be for god to just grow and limb onto our body because he is god because he is god he's the god that created the body he's a god that could use you to change the situation of the body that you're in now i'll tell you why brother brahm said that why he said mr limbs would be added he tells a testimony right in front of it he's talking about the creative act of god he said it was a young girl come in my office this morning i think it was a young girl and he said i believe his mother brought her in there he said she brought her in the back he said the little girl was suffering with leukemia he said her blood had leukemia in it and he said the doctors can't do anything to help him he said but under prayer he said the holy spirit did something and he said he changed the very atoms he recreated the blood cells i believe the way he said it he said he recreated the blood cells that the leukemia couldn't affect the little girl no more he said she's sitting back there healed and then he come and said this about that and i thought look what the way he applied that was that the blood cell was changed and you and now this is for the glory of god i sat in the norway back a few years ago preaching a message on the seven stars of the last days and i was showing that when the hand was open the stars were being revealed i i showed it from the thunders the thunders revealed the symbols and when and when they read it in revelations 1 it was said and under the star or the angel of the church of laodicea and i was showing if john would have wrote that now it would read and unto william branham the church of the laodiceans i write this because william branham was the star the seventh star in the hand when i said that a lady with leukemia been fighting in a couple of years and she was sitting back in the back she had her she had a thing over her hair with a chemo had took in her hair and back she was she was a sick lady amen and that woman sitting there a year later now i come back to that same camp meeting and she corners me in the lunch room she said brother lawson i've been waiting a long time to tell you this she said last year you were preaching a certain sermon i said i remember it since she said when you said the words william branham is the seventh star of the whole night of god she said there was a warm feeling started moving over my body she said that leukemia was completely healed brother lawson she said i am for cancer for now listen to me two years she was fighting it with chemo but in one moment god came by and the whole thing was changed now i'm just crazy enough to believe that if god did it fair he can do it here if god did it anywhere he's still god i believe god can recreate the blood i believe god can change bodies [Applause] we're not here this morning to play with the devil you're the church of the living god and this means war the church is in war with satan this morning we are warring against this enemy we've got a right to war against this enemy he created the first squirrel he can create the next one he created the first frog he could create the next one he created the body he could create a limb to the body he created the blood he can change the blood he is almighty god now i understand it would take deity to do it but deity is in your body you are the temple of the dynamics of almighty god deity lives in the church i believe it's time this morning to cut loose i think it's time to cut loose a tradition it's time to cut loose of everything that says that god cannot completely change the situation in your life this morning i know mr putin over there thinks that he's the most powerful thing in the earth but i beg to differ with him this morning mr putin is not the most powerful his weapons are not the most powerful i tell you the prophet of god said this i find the greatest power in the world it's not an atomic bomb it's a believer in contact with his maker i feel a contact this morning i feel an electricity moving to the church of the living god in contact with the one that can change everything now i know i know a man that there's a lot of a lot of of enemy there's a lot of giants in our lands but brother branham said the power that's in you could create a world and go live on it if it wasn't a law you remember the quote don't you but this is the part that got me he said listen whatever god will lead your soul to believe that is yours every place the souls of your foot can set by faith god gives it to you brother branham likened joshua's footprint on the land with god put it in in your heart to believe amen now when god puts it in your heart to believe it there's still going to be a war there's still going to be a battle something's going to say to you tomorrow did you really get that experience yesterday did was that god really dealt with you would god really speak to you what's that situation really over is god really delivering me this because see satan now after something happens he's going to come right back around and do everything he can do to take it from you because he's a robber now there's a reason the bums are safe in new york because they ain't got nothing to steal but you on the other hand are loaded with the treasures of almighty god and satan is doing what he can do to rob you of what god has given you but god gave you a sword to fend off your enemy he gave you the strength in your heart to say this is my ground this is my property and i will not back away i will not allow i will not let this devil take it all of hell is against it all of hell they're against it they're not against it in the days of paul they're not even against it in the days of brother branham even our enemies will agree that brother branham was a prophet and that he discerned people's hearts but what satan is against is that that jesus christ is right here this morning in the body of you you mothers you daughters you women you sons and daughters of god god is here this morning preacher what are you really getting at i'll tell you what i'm against now is that satan's against the spiritual revelation that christ is here and that he's here in the church that there's a spirit that's on this bride that is the spirit of adoption she knows who she is she knows where she's standing she knows the enemy that's in front of her she knows that the enemy has a voice and the voice of the enemy is always trying to reason the word and make it not so there's always a reason that it ain't you there's always a reason somebody's coming in the future somebody's already done it in the past there's a great revival going to move in some of these days when all these say but with with the nuclear bombs hanging and rushing with his finger hovering over the trigger you tell me when it's going to happen if it ain't now you tell me what space of time are we are we going to give this bride i believe it's right now i believe we have arrived to it now you say preacher amen there's a there's a great battle going on here you are saying here you are saying we're the greatest with the greatest people on the planet the most powerful people that's ever lived scripturally you are the people of strength in the age we're living in according to scripture now you're that spotless word bride not coming but the man said you are see the alpha has become the omega then why the battle then why are the struggle why do you still have to war why is it still a battle to believe why is it a battle to overcome and the situations and some of you are still struggling and you're trying to you're trying to get over the hump and sits but yet you're a son of god and you know you are you're a daughter of god and you know you are from the depths of your heart but things are still worried against your mind on a daily bombarded by the pits of hell trying to get you to turn around walk away don't hold up don't stand there attacked by discouragement attack by tradition attack by criticism but there's something in you that will not lay down will not quit it will not walk away because you were designed to stand in this wicked age by the grace of almighty god amen somebody said well brother wayne if all these things are true then why is all this still here can i share something with you from the book of judges let me just read this i won't be too much longer in the book of judges in the third chapter watch what what's what the the bible says here this is long after joshua is gone he said i will henceforth drive out from before them the nations which joshua left when he died and that though i may prove israel whether they keep the lord to walk therein as their fathers did therefore the lord left those nations without driving them out hastily neither delivered he in the hand of joshua now these are nations which the lord left to prove israel by even as many as of israel had not known the wars of canaan only the generations of the children of israel to know to teach them war at least such as that knew it not before in judges three and two he says it again only the generations that they might teach them war that they might teach them more god did this to teach you war you've got to learn to war we can preach the message to you but you got to learn to war our young people sitting here if you're going to make it in this age you've got to learn to pick the sword up in war you've got to know how to fight back against this giant that's in the land that we're in now you will not get by without knowing how to fight you will not get by on the other side amen and somebody just made the way and you just easily walked in no sir that's not the age we're living in if you get in this it's because you picked your sword up and you fought your way through come on i know what i'm talking about there's giants you've got a youth group here you've got a youth group and i think it's a good thing i think you ought to have youth meetings you ought to have music you ought to have this but if you've got a youth group somebody in that youth group is always going to say hey man they didn't invite me to the party they didn't call me they didn't text me i wasn't asked to sing the lead amen they stole my song all that all that stuff's going to happen and so some of the elders will say well we already just not have a youth group been well i'm not i'm not one of them i believe we have the youth group but we kill the giant i don't think we are to feed giants i think we already killed giants amen i believe we are to have church i believe we are to have holy ghost meetings and there'll be giants that'll come in and say well you shouldn't do it because this problem this problem well wherever people are there's going to be problems amen but we are giant slayers we are anointed by god to teach the children of israel how to war against the devils of the age that we're living in i'll tell you what do you think generals like ron spencer has been doing crisscrossing throughout america the last 20 years you as a church have been generous to share him but he's been teaching war he's been training ministries and people not setting them down in schools and theologies and saying this is how you do it but by standing as an example in the most wicked age preaching the dynamics of god in the age we're living in i tell you this if you want to know how to stand against the devil you just watch ron spencer a little while and you'll learn how to war had a war like a man wars had a war as a church of the living god i tell you what it is there's a battle on but we've been taught to war we've taught we've been tried brother ron and that's on a weekly basis because we're friends i get texts about you all the time somebody says by the way you see brother ron greet him for me i've never never seen a man like that i'm going to say it i'm going to give him a rose somebody don't like it they can shut it off amen god god's blessed this man god's blessed this man with courage of 70 men amen it stands the way he stands sick in this body troubled on every hand amen you you know you know the situation that he's living in but he's got the courage to stand and preach against cancer and tell it what kind of god he serves amen i know he's sick but he ain't sick amen he ain't under his sickness he's teaching you how that he's living in a human body but he's not being defeated by a human body i'll tell you something you're in a body and you've got inheritances and you've got problems and you've got little stubborn streaks and you've got things and you say well i just want to quit are you kidding me how in the world could you quit in the face of what we are seeing in this age the finish line is right in front of you pick up your sword and fight fight fight like you've never fought before in your life [Applause] it's not a time to lose your head it's not a time to throw down your weapon it's not a time to back up if there ever was a season to fight this is the season for your family shamgar for all that you know for all your freedom he said well we're not wearing after flesh now we're not after flesh but those spirits that arise up amen there's people here this morning that have been taught to war and you say well there must be something wrong this spirit and this spirit wouldn't be there if it wasn't something wrong god said i left them in the land even after william branham's gone i left him in the land william branham could have eradicated every devil out of hell when he was here but god said i left it in the land i left it to teach you how to war in the season that you're living in every sun that comes into heaven we'll march in victorious brother matthew you're sealed and your sword will have blood stains from the battles that you fought in the age that you're living in teaching you to war now brother ma'am said it do you know god can train a man to war god can train a church to war he can change them do you know how a people wars it's according to the general they're under one day when joshua come to the walls of jericho he looked at them walls and said how and how in the world will i ever get them walls down but he knew he's going to do it he knew he was going to do it he knew it was going to happen but how am i going to do it and he's sitting there studying the matter and all of a sudden he looks over and there's a man standing there with a sword in his hand and he was so battle hungry he looked at that man said to you for me you against me he knew he was in an offensive battle now he wasn't defensive no more he wasn't just defending his land he was there to possess land he was there to take things away from the devil that the satan had settled on thought people forgot about their freedoms forgot what it meant to be free and feel the power of god but he knew he was there that morning i tell you what can i just get some liberty here when joshua met him and he stood there with that sword in his hand can you imagine the grace and the fear in joshua's eyes when he said who are you he said i'm the captain of this host oh my the captain of all the hosts of heaven had came down to train this man to war [Laughter] i mean the god of all creation had said this battle is so important you're going to read about it in hundreds of years to come my generals in laodicea and throughout the ages we'll read this as a battle plan of how to attack the enemy so joshua you better get it right i'll tell you what some of you probably been in in the army anybody here been in the army navy marines you've been there yeah when they taught you to take down a wall they probably taught you how to do it with explosive or a sledgehammer or with a tank amen but nobody ever commissioned you to walk one down nobody not in all of the history of the wars of the world outside of joshua's was a wall took to the ground by a bunch of people walking around it but when god teaches a man to war he teaches him a way that will operate in the supernatural he wasn't naturally going to do it he was supernaturally going to do it and he lined that group of people up and here's the 2 million of them are so and he told him he said look now here's the instructions this is the action this is the exploit that we're going to do that god is going to give us strength but here's what's going to happen we're going to walk around this wall for six days yeah josh what's going to happen well see now these walls are going to fall before us and and i often often laugh when i read this part six days quiet i think he wasn't preaching to the congregations i'm preaching to if you go down to the full gospel lighthouse and tell them the wall's about to come down and you start trying to lead them around that wall i can just hear them can you imagine trying to choke that shout down look at them massive walls and all of that and you knowing them devils them devils looking off the walls at them and they're out there walking around you talking about confusing buddy you talking about confusing the devil then people just peacefully walking and somebody playing a trumpet and they're just walking along around that they did that for six days on the seventh day you know the story on the seventh day they marched around it seven times but on that seventh goal amen all them trump had sounded at the same time and when the trumpet started sounding something happened with the church that they began to shout a victory amen and the walls were still standing but they started shattered the bible said with one voice they began to shout now you thought military operations were all by sword you thought military operations were all done with spears and with tanks and bombs but in god's military operation you do not separate war from worship and whenever the church really goes to war they begin to worship in a way that confuses the enemy that is watching them can you imagine the confusion that come off of that hill when them people started screaming and shouting hey man somebody said what's the matter with that bunch of crazy people they're down there shouting and it looks like they're completely defeated oh but brother when you're shouting under the inspiration of almighty god something is about to change and they begin to worship and shout until the very walls they were looking at begin to tumble right in front of them i thought oh god amen help me lord to learn how to war to learn to war against this enemy that's in front of me you know what's written in the book of chronicles that they were outnumbered by multitudes when jehoshaphat went down to the house of god and prayed and you know what when he approached god you know what he said to him he talked to the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob and he told him the situation he was in and when god came back to him you know what he said to him he said the battle isn't yours the battle isn't yours he said the battle belongs to me saith the lord well lord amen what am i going to do in this battle well don't sharpen your swords don't even sharpen your spears he said you appoint yourself some singers he said and y'all amen start heading out to that battle and you get them people are singing can you imagine amen that people saw a bunch of a bunch of these renegade israelites and they're beating on instruments they're singing they're shouting they're rejoicing but the bible says that god caused the confusement to come upon their enemies and their enemies turned on one another in that very hour listen to me this morning i know it seems odd to worship in troubled times i know it seems odd to praise god when everything's against you but all of heaven is waiting for the church to begin to rejoice with god in his word before it ever even takes place and when they begin to worship god begin to release the angels out of heaven and they just begin to file off of the benches of god into the battle that was on the earth i'll tell you something this morning i believe that god is still training i believe god is still showing the church what it means to overcome an enemy in this hour i'll tell you what i believe this with all of my heart i believe amen that there is a victory for the church of the living god in the season that we're living in i believe there's a victory like there's never been i'm gonna give you three words in closing this morning i want you to take these home with you there's three words and i want you to remember these three words there is no retreat there is no reserve and there'll be no regret as a church of the living god as we're entering this battle there can be no retreat there can be none you've got to make up your mind i'm in it for the battle you got to make up your mind sitting right here this morning there's not a turning point there's not a point in this battle that i'm going to say it's too much it's too heavy i got to go back listen i want to say something to you this morning i i i i don't even know how i wouldn't even know how to tell you to back up i can't even i can't even imagine coming to the platform this morning to try to address you of how that we could retreat out of this program i don't know how you'd even start that sermon i don't know how you would address that how would you have you ever thought about that how in the world would you say that there's a story told of a young boy who joined the army you know calvary and he didn't have long in training because he's right in the middle of war so they took him down and gave him a trumpet he wanted to be the trumpet player you know he loved to hear the sound of charge so they taught the boy charged they taught him how to play it well and he got it down good and they took off to battle men they've been winning battle after battle and he'd played that charge and played that charge and everybody was ready for the charge one day they come over the hill my goodness that was it was it was a soldier's amen they were just everywhere and the little fella turned around look at the general general said my goodness there's too many this morning sound the retreat and little boy pulled the horn up to his lips he started blowing and next thing you know he's blowing the charge the the whole army heard the they heard the charge and they come over the hill and victorious they become they they just totally obliterated the army before him and when it was all over the general pulled the boy to the side he said son now i told you to sound the retreat why did you disobey the order he said sorry sir he said when i was in training for the army he said nobody taught me the sound of retreat he said i don't even know how to play it on the horn and i tell you this morning church i've trained under men of god that don't know the keys of retreat they don't know how to sound retreat they don't know how to say that back up it's wrong there's no way but the only thing i know to say this morning is charge charge this enemy drive this enemy out of your ground this ground belongs to you this is your season won't you stand to your feet with us this morning there is no there is no place to retreat there is no retreat there is no retreat brother brahm said i don't care what stage of the battle you're in he said speak the word and go forward there is no retreat at the point we're setting this morning there's no words to retreat to there's nothing left behind us we must move forward so brother there's a there's a big giant right in front of us we must move forward we must no reserve brother not now not this time this one you dig deep great warriors in the rings y'all know the stories of them and they'll tell you when you think that you're out you're not and the difference in champions and warriors is they dig deeper to find the hidden reserves i'm reminded of great men right here in this virginia country who cried out giving me liberty or give me death y'all remember that you remember what he said in his speech he said you're gonna fight he said but don't wait until everybody's in chains don't wait till there's a british in every home and you don't have any guns if you're gonna fight he said now's the time now is the time to begin to fight don't wait don't wait till you buy yourself somewhere to try to fight this this is the morning to do it this is the time to do it right now you you have people all around you this morning trained warriors know how to know how to hold a battle you're sitting here this morning facing things and giants in your life and troubles on every hand don't fear it face it this morning there's men of god here to help you to stand with you to drive them forward one thing they said of that great warrior jim bowie in the alamo said a great thing of him that he was killed surely on his bed but when they run and told the news to his mama they said jim's been killed she said well i'll give you a wager he didn't have any wounds in his back because he wasn't running from the battle and i can give you a wager of this bride of christ she'll not take the wound in her back she she goes down she'll go down fighting brother this battle this church amen there's no quitters in it there's no retreat in it there's no way to turn back nowhere to go it's honored christian soldier we're fighting the battle pick up your sword this morning i believe it's the hour the great charge it's at hand the great one you're struggling with it this morning you're struggling with that depression so by the way what am i going to do with it have you ever thought about confusing that devil and just praise god confuse him and worship god them devils will start running around to one another saying what i thought i thought we threw depression on that girl what's mattered with her it's worked every other time it's worked every other time what happened what happened the power of that memory and influence we used to throw on that boy every time he'd start to worship we had that little memory and we'd throw it in there we'd shut him off but something happened to it this morning's not influencing him that was running all wonder woman what's happening see your were sons to begin with created for this battle this night are you ready we wore it maybe somebody said in here this morning you've been you've been in a you've been in a place in your life where your humanity is warring against what you know god has given you to do what you're supposed to be you're sitting here this morning you're warring that maybe some inheritance through your family line comes up every time you're going to really do things right and all of a sudden there it is don't knuckle to that this morning bend your knee to that devil and say well you know i ain't going to be able to do that if there ever was a time it's this morning to stand toe to toe with that devil well ron i already realized juan brother graham said that because it's hard to get eye to eye with a big man but i can get toe to toe i don't care how big the giant is we can get toe to toe [Applause] toe up this morning you're the most powerful force on the face of this earth toe up to the line as far as you're going this morning
