[57:48] Bibles today we want to go to the word
[57:49] of the Lord amen we want to turn to the
[57:52] book of St Luke the 16th chapter the
[57:54] book of St Luke the 16th chap chapter
[57:56] and then we're going to read in
[57:57] Philippians 3 and 2 Corinthians 4 I've
[58:01] been in a bit of a a series at home
[58:03] speaking on the on some things and was
[58:05] going to take a part of that today and
[58:07] the Lord just changed our thought uh
[58:09] there last night so we just pray amen
[58:11] that this will be okay amen I I want to
[58:14] follow him Amen in St Luke chapter 16
[58:18] and then Philippians 3 and if it be
[58:21] possible to put a little bit more in my
[58:22] ear and a little bit of the Lowe's and
[58:23] I'll control it on my side amen St Luke
[58:26] chapter 16 and verse 16 amen the law and
[58:31] the prophets were until John and since
[58:34] that time the kingdom of God is preached
[58:37] somebody say preached preached and every
[58:41] man presseth into it thank you that's
[58:43] good there the kingdom of God is
[58:46] preached and every man presseth somebody
[58:48] say presseth PR presseth into it so
[58:52] according to Jesus there is a preaching
[58:54] of the Kingdom and there is also a
[58:57] pressing into what has been preached now
[59:00] in Philippians chapter 3 Philippians
[59:03] chapter 3 Paul there is writing in
[59:06] Philippians 3 Amen in verse number 13
[59:10] Philippians 3 and verse number 13 and
[59:14] Paul here writing says Brethren I count
[59:16] not myself to have apprehended but this
[59:19] one thing I do forgetting those things
[59:23] which are behind now listen and reaching
[59:27] forth unto those things which are before
[59:29] so Paul is not saying that there's not
[59:32] some things behind the church but he's
[59:34] telling you they're not worth going back
[59:37] to so leave them behind you and reach
[59:41] forth unto the things which are before
[59:44] now watch what he says he says I press
[59:47] toward the mark for the prize of the
[59:50] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so
[59:53] Jesus said the kingdom is preached and
[59:55] man press into it Paul here says forget
[59:58] those things that are behind you and
[1:00:01] press forward into the things that are
[1:00:02] before you let me ask you this how does
[1:00:05] a Believer press let's read let's turn
[1:00:08] to 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse
[1:00:10] number 13 and there I believe Paul will
[1:00:13] give us the answer to the question of
[1:00:15] how a Believer presses 2 Corinthians
[1:00:18] chapter 4 and verse number 13 again Paul
[1:00:22] writing he says now we having the same
[1:00:26] Spirit of Faith according as it is
[1:00:28] written I believed and therefore have I
[1:00:32] spoken now we also believe and therefore
[1:00:35] speak so a Believer presses by believing
[1:00:40] what has been spoken in The Same Spirit
[1:00:42] of faith that it was spoken in in other
[1:00:45] words when you begin to speak what you
[1:00:47] believe you begin to press against the
[1:00:50] enemy that is trying to stop you from
[1:00:52] going into the things that God has
[1:00:54] called you into verse number 18 Paul
[1:00:57] says this while we look not at the
[1:00:59] things which are seen But at the things
[1:01:02] which are not seen for the things which
[1:01:04] are seen are temporal somebody say Amen
[1:01:08] but the things which are not seen are
[1:01:11] Eternal amen we ask Lord this morning to
[1:01:14] add the blessing to the reading of his
[1:01:15] word as you can have your seats here
[1:01:16] today if I would take a title today I
[1:01:19] want to speak to you on this pressing by
[1:01:22] faith into the realities of the Unseen
[1:01:26] pressing by faith into the realities of
[1:01:29] the Unseen 1960 brother Bram preaches a
[1:01:32] very powerful sermon and he will title
[1:01:34] it the unfailing realities of the Living
[1:01:38] God the unfailing realities of the
[1:01:40] Living God and in that sermon brother
[1:01:42] brand will begin to speak about people
[1:01:44] amen that have received the Holy Ghost
[1:01:46] and he'll say this he says oh how many
[1:01:49] more that has received the Holy Ghost
[1:01:51] see he said it's begin to be a talk
[1:01:54] Among Us oh may it revive us to a spot
[1:01:58] that we'll go to searching and hungering
[1:02:00] and pulling for the realities of God may
[1:02:04] it revive us to a spot that we will go
[1:02:07] to hungering and pulling and searching
[1:02:10] amen for the realities of God I love
[1:02:13] this statement for God is a reality amen
[1:02:18] God is a reality how many believes this
[1:02:21] morning that God is a reality he's not
[1:02:24] just a figment of our imagination
[1:02:26] friends he's not just an idol that we
[1:02:29] look to in the time of trouble but our
[1:02:31] God is a reality again he will say this
[1:02:34] now the holy spirit amen will not
[1:02:37] misbehave itself in one person and
[1:02:40] behave itself in another see it will
[1:02:43] make each person come into its character
[1:02:45] see amen because it's a spirit that
[1:02:49] leads you it brings or makes you subject
[1:02:52] to its nature now you don't bring it
[1:02:54] subject to your nature natur but it
[1:02:56] makes you subject to its nature and the
[1:02:59] Holy Spirit makes you live and love to
[1:03:02] do it oh how to give up the things of
[1:03:05] the world when the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:03:08] how it cleanses you and washes you and
[1:03:11] puts a desire in you to follow him and a
[1:03:14] thirst and a hunger amen for more of it
[1:03:17] just bathing yourself see amen he brings
[1:03:21] realities when the Holy Ghost comes into
[1:03:23] the soul of a man amen the Hol Holy
[1:03:26] Ghost brings reality another place what
[1:03:28] we need today is men and women who wants
[1:03:31] a reality hallelujah amen not a Creed a
[1:03:35] reality that's what the world needs
[1:03:37] today it's not Creeds and Fashions amen
[1:03:41] we need realities in God the world don't
[1:03:44] want it they don't want to accept it see
[1:03:47] amen but the church has to have it
[1:03:49] because God wants you to have it amen
[1:03:52] he's the god of realities amen I don't
[1:03:55] know about you but I'm thankful this
[1:03:57] morning for the message of the hour amen
[1:03:59] that has comeing this generation Amen to
[1:04:02] pull us away from the Creeds and the
[1:04:04] dogmas and the Traditions amen and to
[1:04:06] open our eyes up to the realities of the
[1:04:10] Living God now when you start looking
[1:04:12] here at this word press I love the
[1:04:14] definition it means to move or to cause
[1:04:17] Amen to move into a position of contact
[1:04:20] with someone or something by exerting
[1:04:23] continuous physical Force when you look
[1:04:26] there at that word reality amen the word
[1:04:29] reality means a thing that exists in
[1:04:32] fact having previously only existed in
[1:04:35] one's mind now let me say this we know
[1:04:39] amen that the most powerful force there
[1:04:41] is brother R said there's no more
[1:04:42] powerful force than God right amen
[1:04:45] there's no more powerful force than God
[1:04:47] but he also says that the greatest power
[1:04:50] Amen in the world is not the atomic bomb
[1:04:54] amen but it is a belief who is in
[1:04:56] contact with his maker see it changes
[1:04:59] the whole attitude it changes his mental
[1:05:02] it changes his habit it changes his body
[1:05:05] it changes his nature amen it changes
[1:05:09] everything so when a Believer comes in
[1:05:12] contact with his maker amen that contact
[1:05:15] brings a change amen but it also brings
[1:05:18] a reality now in 1946 brother 1949
[1:05:22] brother preaching a sermon called I was
[1:05:25] not disob obedient to the heavenly
[1:05:26] vision and there he's preaching and he
[1:05:28] starts talking about the subject of
[1:05:30] Science and he said I was just thinking
[1:05:32] of how amen that science how they are
[1:05:35] taking the natural man how he's went
[1:05:37] into the research from the fall of the
[1:05:39] natural and what he has done see and how
[1:05:42] little the spiritual man has progressed
[1:05:45] in the kingdom of God he said I was
[1:05:47] thinking that the natural man went out
[1:05:49] at the Unseen of his ey and he pulled an
[1:05:52] adom down out of the sky and he split
[1:05:54] that adom into two and that destroys
[1:05:57] human life he said now if the natural
[1:05:59] man that knows nothing of God and cannot
[1:06:02] know nothing of God except he be
[1:06:04] converted then his soul becomes alive
[1:06:07] with the supernatural if he could do
[1:06:09] that in the natural realm amen then what
[1:06:12] ought the man of God to be doing he said
[1:06:15] friends the church is so far behind amen
[1:06:18] let's pray my that God will move his
[1:06:22] church up amen let's pray that God will
[1:06:25] move move his church up the natural man
[1:06:28] with the natural resources is getting
[1:06:30] greater results amen than people are
[1:06:33] that calls themselves Christians he said
[1:06:35] let's press into the Unseen amen let's
[1:06:39] press into the Unseen the blessings are
[1:06:42] yours amen they are there for you amen
[1:06:46] so a prophet identified where the
[1:06:48] blessings are that belongs to a Believer
[1:06:51] amen the blessings are not in the scene
[1:06:54] amen but whether the blessings are in
[1:06:56] the Unseen he said it like this we have
[1:06:59] blundered in science enough Amen to wake
[1:07:02] us up amen two realities listen the way
[1:07:06] that God moves his church amen is by
[1:07:09] revealing his word to them and then they
[1:07:12] begin to believe the word that's being
[1:07:14] revealed and as they begin to believe
[1:07:17] that word they begin to press against
[1:07:20] the enemy and they begin to move into a
[1:07:22] position of contact with god listen I
[1:07:25] don't know about you amen but I really
[1:07:27] don't care about a social contact I
[1:07:30] don't care about a social network I
[1:07:32] don't care amen about getting a bunch of
[1:07:34] preachers together and trying to come up
[1:07:35] with the best idea I just want to come
[1:07:38] in contact with God I just want to know
[1:07:40] him for myself amen I want to know him
[1:07:43] in the power of his resurrection I want
[1:07:45] to know him in the fellowship of his
[1:07:47] suffering listen I want to know what God
[1:07:49] Amen that at midnight I can call on his
[1:07:52] name I want to know a God that when
[1:07:54] everything is falling apart
[1:07:56] amen I can call on him listen friends we
[1:07:58] need more than a contact with a preacher
[1:08:01] we need more than contact with our
[1:08:02] friends we need more than contact with
[1:08:04] the church we need to come in contact
[1:08:07] with God and stay in fellowship with god
[1:08:10] listen I don't think we ought to just
[1:08:11] have communion once a year amen or twice
[1:08:14] a year amen I think we ought to have
[1:08:16] communion every second of Our Lives you
[1:08:18] say well I'm not talking about the
[1:08:20] natural communion amen I'm talking about
[1:08:22] a spiritual communion where our souls
[1:08:25] are in fellowship with God and we are
[1:08:27] not looking at the things we see amen
[1:08:30] but we are looking at the things we
[1:08:32] don't see now brother B preaches that
[1:08:34] about three times and he'll say this in
[1:08:36] 1950 he said now we look at the Unseen
[1:08:40] and believe those things which are
[1:08:42] unseen amen but spoke of by God Amen
[1:08:46] become realities I wish I had two hours
[1:08:49] on that close we believe the things that
[1:08:52] are spoke of by God Amen and they become
[1:08:55] come realities whenever God speaks
[1:08:59] something if he can find somebody to
[1:09:01] believe it amen the one who believes it
[1:09:04] it will become a reality to them oh
[1:09:08] Church of the Living God Amen if you
[1:09:11] will begin to believe the promises of
[1:09:13] God they will become a reality to you in
[1:09:17] Matthew Chapter 2 the Bible speaks of
[1:09:19] three mag eyes and the prophet picks
[1:09:21] this up and he says isn't it strange
[1:09:24] that these stars were exactly in line
[1:09:26] for three men and nobody else saw it see
[1:09:30] amen now you can be so in line with the
[1:09:32] scripture that when those stars become
[1:09:34] in unity amen United themselves together
[1:09:37] in this constellation amen three men
[1:09:41] were also United at the same time and
[1:09:43] you can be so United with God Amen in
[1:09:47] his word until these things become
[1:09:51] realities you can see them and you can
[1:09:55] know know that they are true listen it
[1:09:57] is not for the world this message is not
[1:10:00] for the world Amen this message is for
[1:10:03] the elect of God that was predestinated
[1:10:06] from before the foundation of the world
[1:10:09] somebody say well I don't know if we
[1:10:10] should believe this or not amen because
[1:10:12] it's not commonly believed among the
[1:10:14] world Amen listen there's a lot of
[1:10:16] things in this Bible that is not
[1:10:18] commonly believed among the world Amen
[1:10:20] but we are in the world but we are not
[1:10:23] of the world Amen we are in Le of see
[1:10:26] but we are not of Le amen God who is
[1:10:29] rich in Mercy has allowed the word amen
[1:10:32] to come over our hearts and we have come
[1:10:35] in one Accord with this word therefore
[1:10:37] we believe things that are strange
[1:10:39] listen I know it's strange amen but I
[1:10:42] believe God calls a man to Salvation
[1:10:44] before he's ever born I know it's
[1:10:47] strange but I believe there's a people
[1:10:49] on the Earth that can no more die than
[1:10:51] God can I know it's strange but I
[1:10:54] believe there's a people whose names is
[1:10:56] in the Lamb's Book of Life and they were
[1:10:58] put there from before the foundation of
[1:11:01] the world and you can't make enough
[1:11:03] mistakes Amen to wipe your name out of
[1:11:06] the Lamb's Book of Life I believe that
[1:11:08] there is a power amen that will take a
[1:11:10] dead man and raising back to life again
[1:11:13] I believe there's a people who are not
[1:11:16] going to a grave but they're going to
[1:11:18] experience a translation I know it is a
[1:11:21] strange thing but I am a peculiar
[1:11:23] believer because I'm United with God and
[1:11:28] His word somebody say well these things
[1:11:30] aren't believed in the Baptist Church
[1:11:32] well this ain't the Baptist
[1:11:35] Church come on Church somebody say well
[1:11:37] my Pentecostal friends don't believe
[1:11:39] that this ain't a Pentecostal Church it
[1:11:41] is the word birth bride now somebody say
[1:11:45] well these things are impossible but as
[1:11:47] I said last night you have been born to
[1:11:50] believe the impossible brother said the
[1:11:52] impossible things are made real when God
[1:11:56] is took at his word amen The Impossible
[1:11:59] is made realities when God is taken at
[1:12:03] his word when you take God at his word
[1:12:06] you are taking the infallible God at the
[1:12:10] infallible spoken word he said see if
[1:12:12] this audience tonight could only get
[1:12:15] settled in their mind of who said this
[1:12:18] and what this really is this spoken word
[1:12:21] we would not need any healing service
[1:12:23] not need any salvation altar called it
[1:12:26] would all be finished if you just
[1:12:28] realized amen what that word was amen
[1:12:32] now come on church amen you know certain
[1:12:34] people say things and depending on who
[1:12:36] they are amen determines how much stock
[1:12:40] amen you put in what said amen if
[1:12:42] somebody sitting down at the coffee shop
[1:12:44] amen says we're going to war amen well
[1:12:46] you'll laugh at him and going about your
[1:12:48] business amen but let the president
[1:12:50] stand up and say we're going to war amen
[1:12:53] it makes a difference amen but because
[1:12:55] of who saying it oh Church of the Living
[1:12:57] God listen this message was not spoke by
[1:13:00] a preacher it was not spoke by
[1:13:02] Theologian but the same Pillar of Fire
[1:13:05] that met Mark and Luke and John met
[1:13:07] William brandom and he said these things
[1:13:10] may I say it as plain as I know how this
[1:13:12] is not the words of a Preacher this is
[1:13:15] the words of God and if you can believe
[1:13:17] it's God if you can believe God spoke it
[1:13:20] then you ought to get your sword in your
[1:13:22] hand you ought to get your feet shot
[1:13:24] with the preparation of the Gospel you
[1:13:27] ought to put on the helmet of salvation
[1:13:29] we're going to war hey we're going to
[1:13:32] war and we're not leaving anything
[1:13:34] behind everything God has promised us we
[1:13:38] are the possessors of the promises of
[1:13:41] God because we have faith in the one who
[1:13:44] has spoke
[1:13:46] it I love what brother B says he says
[1:13:49] before it could be a word spoken amen it
[1:13:52] has to be a thought thank you buddy it
[1:13:54] has to be thought because a word is a
[1:13:58] thought manifest when God speaks he said
[1:14:01] now that's the way God did back in the
[1:14:03] beginning when God looked down to the
[1:14:05] corridors of heaven and saw all the
[1:14:08] things that were going to happen on the
[1:14:10] earth did you ever just say and draw a
[1:14:12] picture out in your mind now that's the
[1:14:14] way God did perhaps in the beginning but
[1:14:17] then it seemed good to him so he spoke
[1:14:20] it and as soon as it was spoken it
[1:14:24] became a word word see the thought was
[1:14:27] expressed in a word now listen once God
[1:14:30] expresses his thought and makes it a
[1:14:32] word he can never take it back oh
[1:14:37] Hallelujah when God's thought becomes a
[1:14:40] word he could never take it back before
[1:14:43] the foundation of the world Jesus was
[1:14:46] already slain the Bible said he was the
[1:14:49] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[1:14:52] world how was he slain the very minute
[1:14:55] God spoke the word it was settled
[1:14:58] forever the seed was planted and it had
[1:15:01] to come to pass because he can not speak
[1:15:04] anything amen but the unadulterated
[1:15:07] truth so when God's thought amen crosses
[1:15:11] his lips as a word it has now become a
[1:15:14] spoken word and it can never be taken
[1:15:18] back when it was thoroughly paid by
[1:15:20] Jesus Christ and you accepted it listen
[1:15:23] and as long as God accepted Christ he
[1:15:27] accepted you with Christ and when did he
[1:15:29] do it amen before the foundation of the
[1:15:32] world when he spoke him into existence
[1:15:36] listen he spoke you redeemed with him oh
[1:15:40] Church of the Living God somebody say
[1:15:42] well I'm going to take your Redemption
[1:15:43] well if you're going to take my
[1:15:45] Redemption you've got to take away
[1:15:46] Jesus's Redemption because the same time
[1:15:49] that he received his Redemption was the
[1:15:52] same time I received my Redemption you
[1:15:55] say what do you mean amen he was the
[1:15:57] Lamb of God slain for the sins of the
[1:16:00] world to redeem the Fallen race of Adam
[1:16:03] listen church this is more than just a
[1:16:05] church it is more than just a group of
[1:16:07] religious people but you are the spoken
[1:16:10] word seed bride you have come from the
[1:16:13] thoughts of God spoke by God into
[1:16:16] manifestation let me say it as plain as
[1:16:18] I know how we are a two-fold being
[1:16:21] friends we have an outward man but we
[1:16:23] also have an inward man man and the
[1:16:25] prophet of God said the outward man
[1:16:27] looks by his eyes but the inward man
[1:16:29] walks by faith the outside man is self
[1:16:33] amen but the inward man is God the
[1:16:36] outside man is self amen but the inward
[1:16:40] man is God you do not see with our eyes
[1:16:43] though many times we thought we see with
[1:16:45] our eyes amen we only look with our eyes
[1:16:48] amen but we see with her heart listen if
[1:16:50] you're going to see more than your
[1:16:52] Humanity if you're going to see more
[1:16:54] than your mistakes if you're going to
[1:16:56] see more than your faults and
[1:16:57] shortcomings you've got to quit seeing
[1:17:00] with your eyes and you got to start
[1:17:02] looking with your heart listen this
[1:17:04] message didn't come Amen to turn our
[1:17:06] eyes it came to turn our hearts because
[1:17:09] if we can ever start looking from our
[1:17:11] hearts we will look at things different
[1:17:14] than the way we look at them with our
[1:17:16] eyes oh Christians pinch that Inside Man
[1:17:19] now and wake him up to the reality that
[1:17:22] Jesus Christ is here Amen to manif EST
[1:17:25] himself to you I love this what a
[1:17:27] prophet says amen he says we all have to
[1:17:29] work together as one unit we have to get
[1:17:32] our differences away and lay aside our
[1:17:34] doctrines and things and put our arms
[1:17:37] together and press forward Amen to take
[1:17:40] the promise that God Almighty has given
[1:17:43] us I'll just say it as plain as I know
[1:17:45] how amen the time has come amen for the
[1:17:48] Believers to press but it's time to
[1:17:51] press forward listen it's time to stop
[1:17:54] worrying it's time to stop Fring it's
[1:17:56] time to stop trying to go back and redo
[1:17:59] and undo and change there has got to
[1:18:01] come a time that you've got to accept
[1:18:03] this in your heart I was not born for
[1:18:05] this world I was not born for Leota I
[1:18:09] have come from God and I'm going back to
[1:18:12] God and I've got to forget the past and
[1:18:14] I've got to start looking at the Unseen
[1:18:17] and believing the things that God spoke
[1:18:19] will become realities listen we're here
[1:18:23] and we're under a divine commission amen
[1:18:25] it's a Divine commission to possess amen
[1:18:28] the promises of God remember said a man
[1:18:31] that's commissioned of God that man
[1:18:33] looks upward and onward you don't care
[1:18:35] what the world says about it anyhow amen
[1:18:37] he's not listening to the world he's got
[1:18:40] a Divine commission from God and he is
[1:18:43] enjoying the presence of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:46] let me say this the Holy Ghost is among
[1:18:48] the church and the Holy Ghost is here
[1:18:51] amen he's doing more than just making us
[1:18:53] feel good he's doing more than just
[1:18:55] making us shout or dance or or speak in
[1:18:58] tongues or see Visions the Holy Ghost is
[1:19:00] here and he's making us perseverant he's
[1:19:03] making us perseverance you say what does
[1:19:06] perseverant mean it means to be
[1:19:08] persistent to make a goal and the pr of
[1:19:11] God said I believe every Christian
[1:19:13] therefore amen should be very
[1:19:16] perseverant he said be perseverant and
[1:19:19] press towards the mark of the High
[1:19:21] Calling amen very persistent in their
[1:19:24] claims to God let me say this we're not
[1:19:27] just pressing against thin air we're not
[1:19:30] just pressing amen against the
[1:19:31] atmosphere of this service amen but we
[1:19:34] are pressing toward something which
[1:19:36] means there's something between us and
[1:19:38] what we're pressing to that don't want
[1:19:41] us to get there but a prophet of God
[1:19:43] said forget those things that are in the
[1:19:45] past now amen and press towards the mark
[1:19:49] of the High Calling listen to the
[1:19:51] complete identification
[1:19:54] all time will fade out into eternity
[1:19:58] when Jesus comes listen friends we are
[1:20:00] not here Amen to press Amen to a partial
[1:20:04] identification we are here Amen to press
[1:20:08] into the complete identification of what
[1:20:11] this word bride is going to be is it
[1:20:13] okay to say what a prophet said he said
[1:20:16] justification made amen I know it is
[1:20:18] it's just a habit so it's okay amen just
[1:20:21] preaching justification made way relax
[1:20:23] justification made way for
[1:20:25] sanctification and sanctification made
[1:20:27] way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[1:20:30] said and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:33] made way for the word itself come come
[1:20:36] down in the church in its Perfection let
[1:20:39] me say this to you friends we are not
[1:20:41] just Justified Christians we're not just
[1:20:43] Sanctified Christians we're not even
[1:20:46] just Holy Ghost filled Christians we are
[1:20:48] word born believers who have gone beyond
[1:20:51] the feelings we have gone beyond the
[1:20:53] sensation we have gone beyond the
[1:20:55] emotions listen we believe in the gifts
[1:20:58] but we ain't following the gifts we
[1:21:00] believe in justification but we ain't
[1:21:02] still smoking a pipe we have climbed all
[1:21:05] the way to the top of the pyramid when
[1:21:07] the Capstone has descended as the
[1:21:10] headship to this body that's why the
[1:21:12] devil hates you it's because he knows
[1:21:14] you have got a seed on the inside of you
[1:21:17] that is ordained to go all the
[1:21:20] way he's not trying to stop you because
[1:21:23] you come to for Gospel Lighthouse
[1:21:25] Tabernacle he's not trying to stop you
[1:21:28] amen because brother Ron is your pastor
[1:21:30] he's not trying to stop you because of
[1:21:32] what kind of family you come out of he's
[1:21:34] trying to stop you because he knows
[1:21:37] there is something on the inside of you
[1:21:40] that is greater than anything he can
[1:21:42] throw against
[1:21:44] you Hallelujah he knows there is a seed
[1:21:48] on the inside of your soul that has the
[1:21:51] ability Amen to shake off the past and
[1:21:54] to remember there is a
[1:21:57] future we're not going to have a
[1:21:59] rearview mirror Affair a rearview mirror
[1:22:01] only looks back and sees where you been
[1:22:04] but we're looking forward Amen to see
[1:22:07] where we are going then where are we
[1:22:09] going church we are pressing into the
[1:22:12] Fulfillment of scriptural promises that
[1:22:15] were made for the age that we're living
[1:22:18] in you said brother Andrew how am I
[1:22:20] going to advance well can I say this
[1:22:23] sometimes and just going real simple you
[1:22:25] know these things but sometimes the only
[1:22:28] way you can advance is you got to
[1:22:30] press am right I know what I'm talking
[1:22:34] about and you do too cuz I can see it on
[1:22:37] some of you that's the only reason
[1:22:39] you're still here today is you've had to
[1:22:42] press you've had to press through some
[1:22:44] disappointments you've had to press
[1:22:46] through some bad days you've had to
[1:22:48] press through some let Downs you've had
[1:22:50] to press through some unbelief you've
[1:22:52] had to press through some doubts you've
[1:22:54] had to press through some lies you've
[1:22:56] had to press through some criticism
[1:22:58] you've had to press through some
[1:23:00] negativity you've had to press through
[1:23:02] amen people saying all kinds of things
[1:23:04] about you you've had to press through
[1:23:06] amen people question what you believe
[1:23:08] you've had to press through ridicule but
[1:23:11] can I say this to you but we're here hey
[1:23:14] we're here this morning and we're not
[1:23:16] half-hearted and we're not just lukewarm
[1:23:19] and we're not just sitting around
[1:23:20] waiting on somebody Amen to get happy so
[1:23:23] maybe we can get happy there is a seed
[1:23:26] on the inside of us and it was spoke by
[1:23:29] God and the revelation of the things of
[1:23:32] our future shall become a reality and
[1:23:37] the devil can't stop it and hell can't
[1:23:39] bind it and the Demons of hell can't
[1:23:41] scare it we know who we
[1:23:48] are sometimes if you're going to advance
[1:23:52] you're going to have to press
[1:23:55] amen the kingdom of God is preached and
[1:23:59] every man presseth into it you know what
[1:24:02] that word prth means it means to use and
[1:24:05] apply
[1:24:07] Force so sometimes you're going to have
[1:24:10] to get mad at that
[1:24:13] devil and you're going to have to use
[1:24:15] some force and apply some pressure and
[1:24:18] do what Paul said he said thou therefore
[1:24:21] run not as un certainly so f i and am
[1:24:24] men not as one that beateth the air can
[1:24:27] I say this we are not fighting flesh and
[1:24:30] blood but we are fighting spirits and
[1:24:34] wickedness and principalities and rulers
[1:24:38] of darkness in high places but brother
[1:24:40] Bram comes along and he preaches a
[1:24:42] sermon called desperation and he uses
[1:24:44] Luke 16 and he said see every man
[1:24:48] presses into it not just simply walks
[1:24:51] into it but it's got to be pressed into
[1:24:55] now let me say what he said here he said
[1:24:57] the law and the prophets were until John
[1:24:59] and since that time amen the Kingdom of
[1:25:02] Heaven has been preached and Men press
[1:25:06] into it you don't just stand around and
[1:25:08] say pick me up by the collar Lord and
[1:25:10] push me in you press into it see you get
[1:25:14] desperate it's between life and death
[1:25:17] now when brother preaches desperation
[1:25:19] listen at his opening prayer he said I
[1:25:21] want to speak tonight on giving them
[1:25:24] courage courage to encourage them amen
[1:25:26] to take that god-given right they have a
[1:25:29] right to defeat that
[1:25:32] devil he is already defeated and he is
[1:25:36] just bluffing them but I'm claiming them
[1:25:39] Father he said now help me Amen to speak
[1:25:42] the word and you speak through me with
[1:25:45] this few notes I got wrote down here and
[1:25:47] little scriptures wrote out he said I
[1:25:50] pray that you'll help me Lord and get in
[1:25:53] the word and give them faith for the
[1:25:56] glory of God so our faith to defeat the
[1:25:59] Devil comes through the preaching of the
[1:26:02] word of God that's why Paul said that
[1:26:06] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:26:08] for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:26:11] amen for by faith the elders obtained a
[1:26:13] good report and through faith we
[1:26:16] understand that the world were framed by
[1:26:18] the word of God so that the things which
[1:26:20] are seen were not made of things which
[1:26:22] do appear listen to the prophet he said
[1:26:25] now you testify of the things you do not
[1:26:29] see you don't testify of what you see
[1:26:32] amen you testify of what you don't see
[1:26:35] because faith is the substance of things
[1:26:37] hoped for it's the evidence of things
[1:26:40] you do not see amen and we look at the
[1:26:43] Unseen somebody say well amen the doctor
[1:26:46] said well we can see the doctor's report
[1:26:49] we can see the scans we can see the
[1:26:51] blood work we can see all the issues
[1:26:54] amen but listen that's not what we talk
[1:26:56] about we talk about the things we don't
[1:26:59] see let me say this amen you say well my
[1:27:01] kid is running from God we can see the
[1:27:04] tattoos we can see the chains we can see
[1:27:07] the unbelief we can see the path are
[1:27:09] going down but that's not what we
[1:27:11] testify about we testify about the
[1:27:15] things we don't see I don't talk about
[1:27:17] how bad they are I talk about how good
[1:27:19] of a service we're going to have when
[1:27:21] they come back to church I don't talk
[1:27:23] about how awful and how bound they are I
[1:27:26] talk about how they're going to shout
[1:27:27] the house down in the liberty of Jesus
[1:27:30] Christ I'm not talking about temporary
[1:27:33] things I am talking about eternal things
[1:27:36] that are not seen amen but they are real
[1:27:39] listen and God didn't say the tattoos
[1:27:42] were real but he said the blood was real
[1:27:44] he didn't say the sin was real he said
[1:27:47] but the blood was real you know what I
[1:27:49] say I say the blood is bigger and the
[1:27:51] blood is greater and the blood is
[1:27:53] stronger and the blood is richer and the
[1:27:56] blood is more powerful than any devil
[1:27:58] you can see any Spirit you can feel any
[1:28:01] evil thing that tries to come upon
[1:28:03] you yes sir we do not testify of the
[1:28:08] things we see we testify of the things
[1:28:11] we don't see because faith is
[1:28:13] Supernatural and it does Supernatural
[1:28:16] things he said then he will give to you
[1:28:18] Supernatural Faith which is spiritual
[1:28:21] Faith then that spiritual Faith amen
[1:28:24] recognizes only the
[1:28:27] word no matter what anybody else says it
[1:28:30] don't do no good it only knows the word
[1:28:35] another place he said faith is something
[1:28:38] that you have to believe it's there that
[1:28:40] really nothing else will declare it's
[1:28:42] there but Faith another place what is
[1:28:46] Faith it's an unseen fory it's a spirit
[1:28:50] and the Holy Spirit brings Faith door to
[1:28:52] the heart 58 oh you claim you got faith
[1:28:55] but you know when Jesus becomes the Lord
[1:28:58] of your faith then all his words become
[1:29:02] real to you when Jesus becomes the Lord
[1:29:05] of your faith then all of his words
[1:29:08] become real to you when God takes the
[1:29:10] Holy Spirit and brings that word to you
[1:29:13] and makes it alive to you a reality that
[1:29:16] your faith it'll stand up and claim it
[1:29:19] you don't have to feel nothing you don't
[1:29:22] have to see nothing or nothing but you
[1:29:24] do have to believe something somebody
[1:29:27] say well we got to be careful just going
[1:29:28] off on believing no I think that's what
[1:29:30] the bride's called to do is not only
[1:29:33] feel something only see something she's
[1:29:35] called to believe something come on
[1:29:37] church we might as well let the rubber
[1:29:38] hit the road we're humans here this
[1:29:40] morning and if we'll really be honest
[1:29:42] with ourselves there have been days we
[1:29:44] did not feel God we did not feel saved
[1:29:47] we did not feel like the bride we did
[1:29:49] not feel like we was going in a Rapture
[1:29:51] amen but why are we still here after all
[1:29:54] those bad days that we didn't feel like
[1:29:56] it because down on the depths of our
[1:29:59] soul was a genan seed of God and the
[1:30:02] seed don't go by feelings the seed don't
[1:30:04] go by sensation the seed goes by
[1:30:08] faith and the faith seed in my heart
[1:30:11] believes God when I'm on the mountain
[1:30:13] and it believes God when I'm in the
[1:30:15] Valley when everybody's with me it
[1:30:17] believes when everybody's again me it
[1:30:19] believes when everybody's shouting it
[1:30:21] believes when everybody's pouting it
[1:30:23] believes come come on Church we're not a
[1:30:25] bunch of fleshly Christians that only
[1:30:27] has a Revival when the music is going
[1:30:30] listen you all are warriors and you've
[1:30:32] learned how to combat this devil you've
[1:30:34] learned how to fight against this devil
[1:30:36] can I say something to you don't lay
[1:30:38] down
[1:30:39] now don't you lay down now don't you lay
[1:30:42] down and bow your knee to them feelings
[1:30:44] them feelings didn't come from
[1:30:46] God come on but you
[1:30:51] did you don't have to feel nothing see
[1:30:53] nothing but you do have to believe
[1:30:56] something now what is fa I hope that's
[1:30:58] okay what is Faith it's the evidence of
[1:31:02] things you do not see see by faith Noah
[1:31:05] being warned of God of things not seen
[1:31:07] as yet he moved with fear and he
[1:31:10] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[1:31:13] house by the which he condemned the
[1:31:15] world and became the heir of the
[1:31:18] righteousness which is by faith so when
[1:31:22] Noah didn't feel like that Ark was
[1:31:24] really going to work he kept on building
[1:31:27] it you know why because he was moved
[1:31:30] brother Jimmy was moved by faith I got
[1:31:33] to look in the Amplified Bible and I
[1:31:35] love the translation there of that
[1:31:37] phrase Things Not Seen in the Amplified
[1:31:40] Bible it means events not yet
[1:31:44] seen events not yet seen now I'm sorry
[1:31:48] amen but I'm the one that says Where oh
[1:31:50] that's right modern events are made
[1:31:53] clear by the prophecy listen friends we
[1:31:56] are believers who do not wait for the
[1:31:59] manifestation to believe the prophecy we
[1:32:02] believe the prophecy therefore we know
[1:32:04] there'll be a manifestation it's like
[1:32:07] it's like the other day I was out in
[1:32:08] California and there was a brother there

[1:32:29] amen and and no offense to brother but
[1:32:31] he is a little excited about it you know
[1:32:32] and finally he asked me we was walking
[1:32:34] down the road he said brother Andrew
[1:32:35] aren't you excited about it amen don't

[1:32:49] manifestation to get excited when I hear
[1:32:52] the prophecy I I judge who it's coming
[1:32:55] from and I know he never said nothing
[1:32:58] that didn't come to pass so I put my
[1:33:00] shouting shoes on I get a harp off the
[1:33:03] willow tree I get a tambourine in my
[1:33:05] hand because I know if he said it come

[1:36:20] almighty God he can do all things and if

[1:37:40] amen it wasn't real to brother Ron he
[1:37:42] didn't even know what was going on but I
[1:37:45] remember as a little boy sitting in my

[1:37:49] stand there on a Saturday night and
[1:37:51] preaching that meeting and say what

[1:38:02] Ghost kept Fanning the Flames until
[1:38:04] brother Ron become the reality of what
[1:38:07] God spoke to brother is bisco oh Church
[1:38:10] of the Living God you say how can you
[1:38:12] believe that because I see
[1:38:14] it I see the manifestation of somebody
[1:38:19] listen he didn't feel like preaching
[1:38:21] when it come he didn't feel like
[1:38:22] shouting when it come but in his soul he
[1:38:25] believed God was able and sister Connie
[1:38:28] believed God was
[1:38:30] a what are you saying I'm saying if
[1:38:33] it'll work for a man in a natural fire
[1:38:36] then what about the Church of the Living
[1:38:38] God I think it's time to get off your
[1:38:41] pity party I think it's time to get off
[1:38:43] of who hurt me and who offended me
[1:38:45] listen if I worried about all that I'd
[1:38:47] still be sitting in the woods somewhere
[1:38:48] in Tennessee hunting this morning but
[1:38:51] God who is rich in Mercy deliver this
[1:38:53] old country boy and give me a reality
[1:38:56] this ain't about a bunch of preachers it
[1:38:58] ain't about a bunch of churches it's
[1:39:00] about somebody believing God is able to
[1:39:02] do anything that he said he could do in
[1:39:04] the face of every devil trying to stop
[1:39:08] it when I don't feel it I believe it
[1:39:12] when I don't see it I believe it because
[1:39:15] I come from
[1:39:17] Noah
[1:39:19] now when you can't see it it's still
[1:39:22] real
[1:39:25] when you can't feel it it's still
[1:39:31] real my goodness how I'm just feeling
[1:39:34] too good right
[1:39:37] now I wonder how all the devils in Hell
[1:39:40] must have
[1:39:43] felt when the Lord spoke to brother
[1:39:46] Ed and brother Ron in that condition and
[1:39:49] then the devil had to sit there and
[1:39:52] watch him stay
[1:39:54] into the reality of what he had tried to
[1:40:01] stop I'm feeling too good right now
[1:40:03] buddy hallelujah what did the devil feel
[1:40:06] like when he had to take a sideline and
[1:40:09] say I tried to stop that but I
[1:40:12] couldn't I tried to stop this from
[1:40:14] happening but I couldn't I tried to kill
[1:40:17] him but I couldn't I tried to make him
[1:40:19] doubt but I couldn't I tried to make
[1:40:21] brother Ed be afraid because what he
[1:40:23] said but I couldn't you know why because
[1:40:26] it wasn't coming from a gift or a man it
[1:40:28] was coming from God oh may I say it to
[1:40:32] you amen the same devil had to step back
[1:40:35] and say I couldn't stop it well I want
[1:40:37] to tell that devil pull you up another
[1:40:39] seat on the sidelines cuz youve tried to
[1:40:42] stop me youve tried to block me youve
[1:40:44] tried to hinder me but one of these
[1:40:46] mornings I'm going to step into the
[1:40:49] reality of a body
[1:40:52] change throw everything you got against
[1:40:54] us devil we'll pick it up and throw it
[1:40:57] back I'm going on with Jesus just the
[1:41:02] same you can talk about me you can
[1:41:05] scandalize my name but you're going to
[1:41:07] have to watch
[1:41:10] me you're going to have to watch me step
[1:41:14] into the reality of what I
[1:41:19] believe I'm sure we get to see it in the
[1:41:21] lot these things begin to shape up
[1:41:23] listen then healing the body doesn't
[1:41:25] become a fiction it becomes a
[1:41:29] reality the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:41:33] doesn't become an emotional worked up
[1:41:35] substance it becomes a reality of the
[1:41:38] indwelling presence of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:42] Christ he's
[1:41:44] always with
[1:41:46] you whether you feel him or not whether
[1:41:50] you see him or not he's there I remember
[1:41:54] as a young Preacher Brother brother Sean
[1:41:55] Mart helped me so much on that point he
[1:41:58] always told me he said brother Andrew
[1:41:59] the angel the Lord accompanies the
[1:42:01] message always he said just preach the
[1:42:04] message well can I say this to you I do
[1:42:06] not have to worry about whether he's
[1:42:08] here or not whether I feel him or not
[1:42:11] whether I see him or not I know he's
[1:42:15] here somebody say how do you know he's
[1:42:17] here because I see the evidence he's
[1:42:19] been
[1:42:20] here brother Chris I don't have to go
[1:42:22] look in the book I don't have to go
[1:42:24] reading the magazine I can see the
[1:42:26] evidence come on church amen somebody
[1:42:29] say well is it rained amen well you know
[1:42:31] what you can do you can get your book
[1:42:33] and you can see in the book if it said
[1:42:35] it was going to rain you can get on the
[1:42:37] internet and check the forecast and see
[1:42:39] if it said it was going to rain you can
[1:42:40] call your friend up and say hey did it
[1:42:42] rain but you know the best way Amen to
[1:42:45] know if it's rain is to go outside and
[1:42:48] look and see if the flowers are wet and
[1:42:51] the grass is wet and the con Creed is
[1:42:53] wet you know what that wetness is it's
[1:42:55] an Evidence it's rained I don't have to
[1:42:58] ask somebody if it's rained I can see
[1:43:00] the evidence of the rain oh church of
[1:43:03] living God I don't have to ask somebody
[1:43:05] is the pillar of fire here this morning
[1:43:08] I see the evidence of the pillar of fire
[1:43:11] as it's whirling across this building I
[1:43:13] see it on you I see it on the pit listen
[1:43:16] I believe it because it was spoke by God
[1:43:23] therefore we preach the word of
[1:43:28] faith and as we preach the word of faith
[1:43:32] it actually pulls you into an atmosphere
[1:43:35] to believe what you can't
[1:43:38] see what you can't
[1:43:40] feel what you can't hear what you can't
[1:43:44] touch what you can't sense what you
[1:43:47] can't remember what you can't reason as
[1:43:50] the word of faith is preached brother
[1:43:53] actually pulls you into an atmosphere to
[1:43:56] believe
[1:43:57] it that's why the devil hates the
[1:44:00] preaching of the
[1:44:02] word I have never fought to stay awake
[1:44:04] during the song
[1:44:07] service I have never fault to stay awake
[1:44:10] during the specials but you know as well
[1:44:12] as I know there have been some times you
[1:44:16] fought to stay awake you know why
[1:44:19] because the devil knows when you begin
[1:44:21] to believe he begins to
[1:44:25] lose the devil knows when you begin to
[1:44:29] believe what you're hearing he begins to
[1:44:31] lose what are you saying I'm saying you
[1:44:34] want to whip the devil right now start
[1:44:36] believing you want to whip that lust
[1:44:39] start believing you want to whip at
[1:44:41] pornography start believing you want to
[1:44:43] whip at depression then start believing
[1:44:46] you want to whip that nervous anxiety
[1:44:48] devil that has plagued you pled your
[1:44:51] family pled your home PL your churches
[1:44:54] PL your life PL your grandma herma you
[1:44:57] know what I say I say start believing
[1:44:59] the word that God Is Bigger and God is
[1:45:02] greater and God is stronger and God is
[1:45:04] able right here right now to give you a
[1:45:07] victory in the house of God like you
[1:45:09] have never seen
[1:45:11] before as you begin to believe he begins
[1:45:14] to lose as you begin to worship he
[1:45:17] begins to back up as you begin to say
[1:45:20] yes Lord I believe you Lord that devil
[1:45:23] begins to realize there's somebody that
[1:45:29] believes now think about this that's the
[1:45:32] reason he says I will not talate with
[1:45:36] any Creed or any denominations because I
[1:45:40] have been commissioned of God to stay
[1:45:45] with the
[1:45:46] word another place I love to see God
[1:45:49] heal his children certainly don't get me
[1:45:52] wrong but one reason I've been noticing
[1:45:54] if you notice lately I've been trying
[1:45:56] everywhere I go when I get an invitation
[1:45:59] is press in to preach just a little bit
[1:46:01] I've let down on my preaching and it's
[1:46:04] putting too much on just the anointing
[1:46:06] and the working on the Eternal part of
[1:46:09] the supernatural rather that when to see
[1:46:11] the Visions they're wonderful and I
[1:46:13] thank God for it but yet the preaching
[1:46:16] of the word is a million miles beyond
[1:46:20] that on now brother sister that's a
[1:46:24] heavy one that the preaching of the word
[1:46:27] is a million miles Beyond division it's
[1:46:30] a million miles Beyond just the ability
[1:46:33] to see something in the Supernatural
[1:46:35] realm and relate it to the people the
[1:46:37] preach now I can prove that to you
[1:46:39] because brother said people can see
[1:46:41] things and it be nothing but Illusions
[1:46:43] and he said what will happen is it
[1:46:45] really is an illusion but you'll imagine
[1:46:48] it something spiritual and he said
[1:46:49] you'll continue to imagine it till you
[1:46:52] really believe it listen and it will
[1:46:54] become a reality to
[1:46:57] you now I'm on something can I preach a
[1:46:59] second there's people that get in their
[1:47:02] minds that somebody don't like
[1:47:05] them they get in their mind that
[1:47:07] somebody's against them and somebody's
[1:47:09] out to get them and they get that in
[1:47:11] their mind and they start living under a
[1:47:14] victim mentality and they start
[1:47:16] imagining so and so don't like me and
[1:47:18] brother Ron must not like me cuz it's
[1:47:20] been three Sundays since he shook my
[1:47:21] hand and brother and must not like me
[1:47:23] cuzz he looked right past me and brother
[1:47:25] William he must not like me cuz he took
[1:47:27] up the offering and didn't smile at me
[1:47:29] when he took my dollar well maybe give
[1:47:31] some more no I'm just kidding it's a
[1:47:34] joke that's on the internet it'll be all
[1:47:35] over the world give what you can God
[1:47:37] will bless
[1:47:39] you getting too serious in
[1:47:43] here well I tell you brother Ron was
[1:47:46] preaching and he looked across the crowd
[1:47:47] he looked at everybody but me and you
[1:47:49] know what happens you start imagining
[1:47:51] you start believing that M can I say
[1:47:53] this and it becomes a reality to you but
[1:47:57] then people get mad cuz it don't become
[1:47:59] a reality to nobody else well you know
[1:48:01] why it don't become a reality to nobody
[1:48:03] else cause it ain't real to nobody but
[1:48:07] you you have imagined it so long it's
[1:48:10] become real to you and people quit
[1:48:13] church because things become real to
[1:48:15] them it's not real to nobody else in the
[1:48:18] entire assembly woo glory to God
[1:48:21] somebody shout hallelujah you know what
[1:48:23] I say I say it's time to quit imagining
[1:48:26] and start believing we don't have to
[1:48:28] imagine God loves us we know he loves us
[1:48:31] we don't have to imagine God saved us we
[1:48:34] know he saved us listen I don't have I
[1:48:37] thank God I don't believe something
[1:48:39] brother on that I got to stand on an
[1:48:41] island by myself and
[1:48:42] [Applause]
[1:48:48] believe it becomes real to you
[1:48:54] can I preach and because it's not real
[1:48:57] to nobody else then people start trying
[1:49:00] to make it real to somebody
[1:49:03] else they concoct a bunch of things
[1:49:06] together and present this and it's
[1:49:08] nothing but
[1:49:11] imaginations come on people walk off and
[1:49:13] say ain't nobody in that church loves me
[1:49:16] I'll tell you what I think you are I
[1:49:17] think you're a
[1:49:20] liar because until you've asked
[1:49:22] everybody from God to the least of
[1:49:24] infant child if they love you then
[1:49:27] you're
[1:49:28] lying woo I guess it's just the evangels
[1:49:31] coming out you're lying you say well
[1:49:33] brother Andrew I asked the Elder and I
[1:49:34] asked the youngest well let me tell you
[1:49:36] this have you forgot who's always in the
[1:49:38] church that's the Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:49:41] don't care if the Elder don't love me I
[1:49:43] don't care if the baby thrs up every
[1:49:45] time he sees me if Jesus Christ the son
[1:49:47] of God is in the house of God then I
[1:49:50] don't care if everybody's against me I
[1:49:52] know there's one in there that loves me
[1:49:54] and greater is he that is with me than
[1:49:57] the Devils that's against me get up and
[1:49:59] get off your pity party and quit
[1:50:01] imagining things and start believing the
[1:50:04] word of God and pressing against those
[1:50:08] spirits come on somebody we ain't got to
[1:50:11] imagine we're going in the Rapture I
[1:50:13] know I'm going in the
[1:50:19] Rapture the success of this church he
[1:50:22] says it lies within the preaching of the
[1:50:25] Gospel of the power of God and the
[1:50:28] demonstration of the spirit therefore he
[1:50:32] sent anointed preachers to preach the
[1:50:33] word and you received it another place
[1:50:36] Christ does not anoint ministers to
[1:50:38] preach the gospel just to have it return
[1:50:40] back to him void but he expects you to
[1:50:42] receive the
[1:50:45] word can I read the rest of it and in
[1:50:48] receiving the word be ready
[1:50:54] I got to thinking about that one day
[1:50:55] brother Ron in receiving the word be
[1:50:59] ready ready for
[1:51:02] what ready for the results that the word
[1:51:07] produces can I say something to you we
[1:51:10] are living in an age where as you
[1:51:12] receive the word you become the
[1:51:17] word we are living in a season brother
[1:51:21] Andrew when you can read a prayer
[1:51:22] request and at the end of the service it
[1:51:25] can already be a
[1:51:28] testimony I've seen it happen I have
[1:51:31] seen it happen where a prayer request
[1:51:33] becomes a testimony in the middle of a
[1:51:36] service I was preaching one time down in
[1:51:38] Georgia right there in the middle of
[1:51:40] covid you know and everybody was scared
[1:51:41] to death to do anything besides Brea you
[1:51:43] and somebody even scared to do that amen
[1:51:44] right there in the middle of that and we
[1:51:46] was having a meeting however they felt
[1:51:47] led God bless them we was having a
[1:51:49] meeting right there and all of a sudden
[1:51:51] a prayer requests come in right before I
[1:51:52] got to preach pray for baby so and so in
[1:51:54] the hospital they think it's co 104
[1:51:57] fever so we prayed and I got up and got
[1:51:59] to preaching and you ever been there
[1:52:00] brothers You're Just preaching and you
[1:52:01] feel that thing hanging over the
[1:52:03] congregation and I'm preaching away
[1:52:04] knowing what I'm working against and
[1:52:06] while I'm preaching all of a sudden
[1:52:08] brother Jim somebody walks up there and
[1:52:09] slips a note on the pull pit and I
[1:52:11] picked up the note and I read it and I
[1:52:13] said well glory to God I said here's
[1:52:15] what the note says the baby we prayed
[1:52:17] for the temperature just broke and
[1:52:20] they're releasing it from the hospital
[1:52:22] the co test is
[1:52:25] negative you know what I watched I
[1:52:27] watched the power of God drop right in
[1:52:29] that service and somebody sitting on the
[1:52:31] front row jumped up on their feet and
[1:52:34] took off running up and down the aisles
[1:52:36] praising God you say preacher why
[1:52:38] because we're living in the season
[1:52:40] Church where if we just keep believing
[1:52:43] and we just keep pressing and we just
[1:52:45] keep walking something's going to
[1:52:49] change as you receive the word you
[1:52:52] become the word listen friends the Bible
[1:52:54] said we'll cast out Devils we'll lay
[1:52:56] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:52:59] somebody say why are you so strong on
[1:53:01] the preaching of the Gospel of the
[1:53:03] message of the hour because the
[1:53:05] preaching of the Gospel is the casting
[1:53:08] out of the devil he said God give me the
[1:53:12] authority to break the power of Satan
[1:53:15] another place you give us the divine
[1:53:17] power Amen to break the power of Satan
[1:53:19] over this life in the name of Jesus
[1:53:22] Jesus Christ somebody say this with me
[1:53:25] over this life notice he did not say in
[1:53:30] this
[1:53:33] life
[1:53:37] over now what I'm going to say to you
[1:53:40] might help you if you listen to me quit
[1:53:42] letting the devil tell you you're
[1:53:47] possessed you're not possessed you're
[1:53:51] oppressed

[1:53:55] between possession and oppression when
[1:53:59] you are demon possessed that mean oh God
[1:54:02] I'm feeling good that means the devil's
[1:54:04] got you but when you're demon oppressed

[1:54:26] me W glory to God if you was going to
[1:54:29] get me devil you should have done got me

[1:54:37] youth camp he got me for the Rapture he

[1:58:31] down you ain't never going to talk this
[1:58:33] devil down and you ain't never going to
[1:58:34] reverse psychology on this devil there's
[1:58:36] only one thing this devil must do that's
[1:58:40] die that devil must die and the only way
[1:58:43] that Devil's going to die is not by a
[1:58:45] couch and a shrink sitting on the other
[1:58:47] side it's going to take the power of the
[1:58:50] Holy Ghost and Fire to remove that
[1:58:52] Spirit from controlling your
[1:58:55] life I know they get mad at me and say
[1:58:58] everything they want but I'm going to
[1:58:59] say it as plain as I know how away with
[1:59:02] psychology and bring back the Holy
[1:59:07] Ghost it worked 20 years

[1:59:12] ago brother I'm just getting too
[1:59:15] free it used to work 20 years
[1:59:18] ago but you know what happened is a
[1:59:20] bunch of uncalled men in invaded pull
[1:59:22] pits and didn't have the anointing to
[1:59:24] stand there and war with them Devils so
[1:59:27] they had to resort to something so
[1:59:29] instead of going the Pres to the pillar
[1:59:30] of fire and meeting God for themselves
[1:59:32] they went got on some website and got
[1:59:35] some psychology certificate you know
[1:59:37] what I say I say it can work in a
[1:59:39] hospital it can work in a doctor's
[1:59:41] office but for the love of God and the
[1:59:43] sake of his people leave it out of the
[1:59:45] Church of the Living
[1:59:46] [Applause]

[2:04:04] that house he said I brought them all
[2:04:06] around the table and I sat down with
[2:04:08] that message book and I just started
[2:04:10] reading some quotes to him and started
[2:04:12] telling about what a prophet said how he
[2:04:14] said there's a spirit behind everything
[2:04:16] and how you got to recognize the devil
[2:04:18] and every one of his tactics he said in
[2:04:19] just a few moments as clear as I'm
[2:04:21] talking to to you he said there was like
[2:04:22] a whoosh went out of the room and he
[2:04:24] said there was a presence of God come in
[2:04:26] that room and I'm going to say the rest
[2:04:27] of the testimony and just say this and
[2:04:29] they're still together

[2:05:29] boots because you wear the shoe that's
[2:05:33] fitting for the activity that you're
[2:05:34] fishing to do somebody say why do you
[2:05:37] wear walking shoes to the house of God
[2:05:40] because I know when the word is preached

[2:06:29] you can't possess it can I say this to
[2:06:31] you them Spirits are

[2:07:39] from Florida for a New Year's meeting
[2:07:41] and sitting there on the plane I'm on my
[2:07:43] computer reading and listening to a tape
[2:07:44] going over some notes all of a sudden I
[2:07:47] hear brother brother brandom say this he
[2:07:48] said now here he said here's my New
[2:07:50] Year's message to you all Shalom and I
[2:07:53] said my what a powerful New Year's
[2:07:56] message and brother Ruben I just closed
[2:07:58] my computer and bowed my head right
[2:08:00] there on the plane and I said Lord I
[2:08:02] said I'm going tonight to speak to your
[2:08:04] people I said if I would go and speak to
[2:08:07] him tonight on this new year service
[2:08:09] going into a new year I said Lord what
[2:08:12] would be my New Year's message I said
[2:08:14] Lord and just just as plain as I'm
[2:08:17] talking to you I said 'lord I said ould
[2:08:19] you give me a New Year's message
[2:08:22] it's plain as I'm speaking to you right
[2:08:23] now brother Spirit of the Lord spoke in
[2:08:25] my heart and said these words said go
[2:08:27] tell my people just keep
[2:08:34] walking I said Lord you know how his
[2:08:37] preachers do sometimes Lord they've
[2:08:40] heard that a thousand times but as clear
[2:08:43] as I'm just praying right here in this
[2:08:44] in this plane Spirit of the Lord spoke
[2:08:46] back to my heart and said just keep
[2:08:48] walking I said okay Lord I Surrender
[2:08:52] I said now Lord if you told me something
[2:08:53] I'm going to find it in this message and
[2:08:55] I got on my on my tablet there and I
[2:08:57] started researching those words in the
[2:08:59] message just keep walking and I was
[2:09:03] reading where brother B said okay he
[2:09:04] said now see he said if you sit there
[2:09:06] you ain't going to ever get no word just
[2:09:07] keep walking he said something like this
[2:09:09] said he said see here you're coming you
[2:09:11] got this cancer he said but if you'll
[2:09:13] just keep walking God will heal you go
[2:09:15] on oh here you come you got this heart
[2:09:17] condition but if you'll just keep
[2:09:18] walking and I'm reading through there
[2:09:19] and he's talking about just keep walk
[2:09:21] walking just keep walking just keep
[2:09:22] walking and I'm just fellowshipping with
[2:09:24] the Lord and I stopped I said Lord I
[2:09:27] said there's got to be a reason that
[2:09:29] brother Bram stands there and keeps
[2:09:31] telling the people just keep walking and
[2:09:34] I just kept reading and I come across
[2:09:36] this quote he says see that's the way
[2:09:40] you get well is just keep on
[2:09:46] walking I said no I got to go back and
[2:09:48] read that again that's the way you get
[2:09:51] well see is just keep on
[2:09:55] walking I said Lord I believe it you
[2:09:58] know what he said in my heart just in
[2:10:00] prayer in my heart these words come if
[2:10:02] you'll just keep walking you're going to
[2:10:05] walk from one condition to another I
[2:10:07] said oh there it is that's why they come
[2:10:10] on the platform with heart trouble but
[2:10:11] he said just keep walking you know why
[2:10:14] because as they were walking they were
[2:10:16] progressing and as they were progressing
[2:10:19] they were changing their condition misss
[2:10:22] I went down and preached that the other
[2:10:23] day in a church and the brother text me
[2:10:24] to day he said do we just build a new
[2:10:26] website he said that's on the front of
[2:10:28] our website just keep walking he said
[2:10:30] that was just for our church you know
[2:10:32] why I say that I know it's simple and I
[2:10:34] know you've heard it thousands of times
[2:10:36] but God is made that so real this year
[2:10:39] in the depths of my heart if you'll just
[2:10:41] put your walking shoes on I know some of
[2:10:43] you are tired I know some of you are
[2:10:46] weary I know you've been in this battle

[2:10:51] hopeless situation but hear this old
[2:10:53] crazy spit and sweating preacher this
[2:10:55] morning get up and start walking

[2:22:07] there's a marriage supper of the lamb
[2:22:09] and you got a seat at the
[2:22:11] table how many today says Lord I want to
[2:22:13] believe what you
[2:22:16] spoke and I'm going to
[2:22:19] press until it be becomes a
[2:22:24] reality somebody say well the devil the
[2:22:26] devil told me God don't love me that
[2:22:28] Devil's a
[2:22:30] liar you imagine that long enough it'll
[2:22:32] become real to you but it ain't real to
[2:22:35] God cuz God Loves
[2:22:37] You by our hearts this
[2:22:42] morning what they heard bowever I closed
[2:22:46] would there be one here this morning
[2:22:47] could say
[2:22:48] Lord I'm done with a m
[2:22:51] inations I'm done imagining these
[2:22:55] things brother BR sat like this he said
[2:22:57] you're Crossing Bridges before you get
[2:22:59] to
[2:23:00] them said you're all nervous you're all
[2:23:02] tore
[2:23:04] up how many this morning say Lord I
[2:23:07] don't have to imagine any longer I can
[2:23:10] read in your word and I can believe what
[2:23:13] has been spoken by the vision and I'm
[2:23:16] going to press towards it I'm going to
[2:23:18] walk towards it
[2:23:24] somebody say something about you they
[2:23:25] say well you're this or you're that and
[2:23:27] you imagine that and imagine it and
[2:23:29] imagine it and it becomes a reality and
[2:23:32] it's really not who you are but it's
[2:23:34] real to
[2:23:36] you this morning I believe the holy
[2:23:38] spirit is dealt with imaginations right
[2:23:40] here in this
[2:23:43] building that imagination will build you
[2:23:45] a
[2:23:46] complex and that complex will put you in
[2:23:48] a prison somewhere maybe maybe not a
[2:23:50] natural prison a spiritual
[2:23:52] prison and it'll have you afraid to do
[2:23:55] anything have you afraid to believe
[2:23:57] anything have you afraid to trust
[2:23:59] anybody have you afraid to trust a
[2:24:01] preacher afraid to trust a church it's
[2:24:04] nothing but an imagination that built a
[2:24:07] complex but I say this morning House of
[2:24:10] Hell give way to the name of
[2:24:14] Jesus I rebuke every imagination here
[2:24:17] this morning that would try to Blind
[2:24:19] God's children from seeing the reality
[2:24:21] of who they are in the
[2:24:23] word almighty God your word has gone
[2:24:27] forth in this Sanctuary this morning
[2:24:29] Lord these Believers have pulled on the
[2:24:31] gift of God Lord that gift was not put
[2:24:34] in my life for me Lord it was put there
[2:24:36] for your children now Lord they operate
[2:24:39] that gift and Lord as they pulled this
[2:24:42] morning and pulled on that word father I
[2:24:45] believe needs have been met right here
[2:24:46] this morning Lord I pray this morning as
[2:24:49] your word has gone forth I pray that the
[2:24:52] power of God has broke the clouds of
[2:24:55] doubt and depression and oppression Lord
[2:24:57] I pray if there be somebody here this
[2:24:59] morning that Lord they they've lost
[2:25:01] sight of what your word said about them
[2:25:04] they begin to believe things about
[2:25:06] themselves and they begin to believe
[2:25:08] things that they've imagined and they've
[2:25:09] become real to them and Lord they get
[2:25:12] angry because somebody else don't
[2:25:13] believe it or somebody else don't think
[2:25:15] it the way they do lord it's because
[2:25:17] it's real to them and nobody else but
[2:25:20] Lord I'm so thankful this morning that
[2:25:22] the word of God is not an imagination
[2:25:26] it's a revelation and Lord it can be
[2:25:28] real to the elders and the youngest baby
[2:25:31] Lord it can be real to the preachers to
[2:25:33] the housewives to the Musicians to the
[2:25:36] janitors Lord even down to the little
[2:25:38] Ley the little elder sister that comes
[2:25:40] to the house of God this word can be
[2:25:42] real to them now Lord I pray this
[2:25:45] morning by the power of the Holy Ghost
[2:25:48] may you give him the grace Lord to press
[2:25:50] back against these Spirits Lord every
[2:25:53] devil that's trying to stop them from
[2:25:55] going forward may they press against it
