[0:00] a way to worship amen and worship in
[0:02] vain that's why the Bible said the whole
[0:04] Earth would worship the mark of the
[0:06] beast except those who have their names
[0:09] in the Lamb's Book of Life see because
[0:11] it would be such a deceptive age and it
[0:13] would be a religious age and everybody's
[0:15] going to be worshiping amen so we find
[0:17] out that God then has got mercy and
[0:20] Grace to be able to un give us an
[0:23] understanding or he would be able to
[0:25] bring something to us that we wouldn't
[0:27] have to presume now I I think that's a
[0:30] powerful thing that if God is the one
[0:32] that's going to be worshiped he was the
[0:33] one that teach us how to worship and
[0:36] certainly that God Amen has a way in
[0:39] that he brings his word is he brings it
[0:41] through prophets now according to Amos
[0:43] the thir chapter and the seventh verse
[0:45] the Bible teaches us that God would do
[0:48] nothing until first he reveals it
[0:50] through his servant the prophet amen and
[0:52] that that teaching is not just in the
[0:54] Book of Amos but that was coming from
[0:57] what what Moses taught in the book of
[1:00] Deuteronomy if you're a Bible reader in
[1:02] Deuteronomy the 18th chapter it was uh
[1:04] in this time that God had appeared under
[1:07] the children of Israel and he had did it
[1:09] in a great fire and quaking and the
[1:11] people were fearful and they went to
[1:13] Moses and they said Lord don't speak to
[1:15] us like that anymore don't don't ask God
[1:18] to not talk to us like that but but but
[1:20] to do it some other way and when they
[1:22] did that Moses went unto the Lord and he
[1:24] come back and told the people God has
[1:26] honored your prayer and he has said to
[1:28] thee that God would raised up a prophet
[1:31] from the midst of ye and he would do it
[1:33] liken unto me and him shall ye hearken
[1:36] unto and according to all that thou
[1:39] desirest the Lord thy God in horor in
[1:42] the day of the assembly saying let me
[1:44] not hear again the voice of the Lord my
[1:46] God Deuteronomy 18:16 and neither let me
[1:49] see this great fire anymore that I die
[1:51] not and the Lord said unto me thou have
[1:54] well spoken that which they have spoken
[1:57] and I will raise them up a prophet among
[1:59] the Brethren like unto thee and I will
[2:01] put my words in his mouth and he shall
[2:03] speak unto them and that I shall command
[2:06] him and it shall come to pass that
[2:08] whosoever will not hearken unto my words
[2:11] which he shall speak in my name I
[2:13] require it of him and but the prophet
[2:16] which shall presume to speak a word in
[2:18] my name which I have not commanded him
[2:20] to speak or he shall speak in the name
[2:23] of other gods even that Prophet shall
[2:26] die and in thou say in thine heart how
[2:29] shall we know how shall we know the word
[2:33] which the Lord hath not spoken and when
[2:35] a prophet speaketh in the name of the
[2:37] Lord if the thing follow not nor come to
[2:40] pass the thing which the Lord hath not
[2:43] spoken that Prophet has spoken
[2:46] presumptuously and thou shalt not be
[2:48] afraid of him amen and thou shalt not be
[2:52] afraid of him because what presumption
[2:54] means is to speak without Authority in
[2:56] other words amen you you've seen an
[2:58] entire age of it when men uh speak like
[3:01] they speak for God but they're not
[3:02] speaking for God because what they say
[3:04] don't come to pass so it's a
[3:06] presumptuous speaking and God said you
[3:08] don't have to fear that man see but we
[3:11] find out that that's presumption is not
[3:14] the order of the worship of the bride of
[3:16] Christ you you see God is not requiring
[3:20] us to Worship in a place that we don't
[3:22] know what we're worshiping if God
[3:24] requires of a man to worship he is also
[3:28] obligated to make him own self known
[3:31] that you would be worshiping God and not
[3:34] worshiping the devil now watch what he
[3:36] tells us in Acts the thir chapter the
[3:38] Bible tells us that the Lord God he said
[3:41] s shall send Jesus Christ which was
[3:43] before preached unto you and the heavens
[3:45] must receive him until the time of the
[3:48] restitution of all things which God has
[3:51] spoken by the mouth of the holy prophet
[3:53] since the world began and for Moses
[3:56] truly said unto the fathers a prophet
[3:59] shall the Lord God rais up unto your
[4:01] brethren liken unto me and him shall you
[4:04] hear in all things whatsoever he shall
[4:07] say unto you how many realizes that
[4:09] Jesus Christ is a
[4:11] prophet amen that Jesus Christ is a
[4:14] prophet now I got to say this very
[4:15] clearly amen he's not only a prophet he
[4:18] is the prophet amen he's not only see
[4:22] you can go back and you can see when
[4:23] David prophesied he was typing Christ
[4:26] and when Moses prophesied he was typing
[4:28] Christ and and and when you see how that
[4:30] Isaiah was prophesying he was typing
[4:32] Christ amen but Isaiah was not Jesus and
[4:36] and Moses was not Jesus and David was
[4:38] not Jesus they only typed him amen but
[4:41] when Jesus came he was not a type of
[4:44] David he was the Fulfillment of what
[4:47] David was typing so the god of Abraham
[4:50] and the god of David and the god of
[4:52] Moses and the god of Isaiah amen he was
[4:55] the god of the prophets he was the
[4:57] prophet of all prophets amen the Bible
[5:00] teaches us that the Lord Our God shall
[5:02] raise a prophet like it unto thee now
[5:05] what does that mean it means that God
[5:07] would raise Jesus Christ and he would
[5:10] bring him out of the scriptures so when
[5:12] Jesus came he was not a self-proclaimed
[5:14] prophet he wasn't because a group said
[5:17] he was a prophet it's because he was a
[5:19] fulfillment of the scriptures that was
[5:21] pointing to the generation that he was
[5:23] living in amen that a prophet should
[5:26] come out of this now I say that because
[5:28] people say to me all the time said well
[5:30] there's no such thing as prophets in the
[5:32] last day and if you've ever talked to
[5:33] someone and you tell them well we PR a
[5:35] prophetic message in the end time mostly
[5:37] what they want to say is a false prophet
[5:39] that's all people know about these days
[5:41] is false prophets that's all they talk
[5:42] about whether the Antichrist he'll be a
[5:44] false prophet well how do you have a
[5:46] false one without having a real one amen
[5:48] how do you have a bogus $100 bill unless
[5:51] you got a real $100 bill and the only
[5:53] reason they're going to fake being a
[5:55] prophet is because a prophet has
[5:57] Authority and he sets the the order amen
[6:00] of the of the very thing that God has
[6:03] required of the people to bring worship
[6:05] unto that church now look at the power
[6:07] this when Jesus comes he was a prophet
[6:09] so somebody said well the law and the
[6:11] prophets were under John well Jesus was
[6:13] after John was he not amen wasn't Jesus
[6:16] after John and he was the prophet of all
[6:19] prophets he fulfilled the law of the
[6:21] prophets but let me say this that
[6:23] Prophet Jesus never died amen I know
[6:26] they put him in a tomb but he rose up on
[6:28] the third day and that's why the Bible
[6:31] says in the Book of Revelations that our
[6:33] testimony is the testimony of Jesus
[6:35] Christ which is the spirit of Prophecy
[6:38] the very spirit that beats in your heart
[6:40] tonight as a Christian is the spirit of
[6:43] Prophecy amen Jesus himself is the
[6:46] prophet amen and he comes into the
[6:48] church now now we do not have to be
[6:50] confused tonight amen about the order of
[6:53] worship and what God has designed for
[6:55] this generation when I say that because
[6:57] it's an age of confusion I don't have
[6:59] time to preach on the age of confusion
[7:01] but but just know it's an age of
[7:03] confusion and I'll say this it's so
[7:06] confusing men don't know whether they're
[7:08] men and women don't know if they're
[7:09] women they don't know what bathroom they
[7:11] don't know what kind of clothes to wear
[7:13] they don't know if they're cats or
[7:14] they're humans or amen why it's because
[7:17] of the confusion and the confusion began
[7:20] in religion and religion ended up in
[7:22] perversion and the whole world Amen is
[7:25] worshiping the devil because of
[7:28] confusion on religion well I thank God
[7:30] tonight that we don't have to live in
[7:32] confusion but we've got a word that has
[7:34] come from God and is sent back the
[7:37] church in the power of the Holy Ghost
[7:40] yes we believe in prophets go ahead and
[7:42] finish the scriptures if you're going to
[7:44] quote them amen the law and the prophets
[7:46] were until John but what after that come
[7:48] on what after that after that is the
[7:51] kingdom of God that's why Hebrews
[7:53] chapter 1 it said that God spoke to the
[7:55] prophets in various times but in the
[7:57] last days he would speak through his son
[8:00] Jesus Christ who is the prophet of all
[8:03] prophets that's why the Bible said in
[8:05] Luke 17 and the 30th verse that he would
[8:08] reveal himself as the son of man in the
[8:11] last days amen because we do not have to
[8:14] be confused about worship he was to tell
[8:17] us these things
[8:20] Hallelujah Divine Authority would return
[8:23] to the church in the last days in John
[8:25] the 4th chapter if you want to read it
[8:27] with me it let's start in the third
[8:29] verse and he left Judea and departed
[8:31] again unto Galilee amen and he said he
[8:35] has needs to go to
[8:38] Samaria then he come to a city of
[8:40] Samaria which is called Saar it's near
[8:42] to the partial of ground that Jacob had
[8:44] gave his son Joseph and Jacob's Well was
[8:47] there now I want you to notice the Bible
[8:50] said he went to Samaria now if you're if
[8:52] you're a studier at all of geography
[8:55] amen Samaria wasn't on the way amen he
[8:58] had to go out out of the way to go to
[9:00] Samaria and most nobody wanted to go
[9:03] through Samaria as a Jew because the
[9:06] Samaritans were rejects of the Jewish
[9:08] race because they were a mixed up lot
[9:11] they were a mixed breed and they had
[9:12] their own kind of worship amen and most
[9:15] of the Israelites didn't fool with the
[9:17] Samaritans but but Jesus said I have a
[9:21] need to go buy Samar how many knows why
[9:23] he had to go there amen because there
[9:26] was a woman he was going to meet on that
[9:28] well amen and that woman wasn't just any
[9:31] other church it was an ordained and
[9:35] predestinated woman that had something
[9:38] in her that would recognize him when the
[9:41] whole world was going to recognize him
[9:43] they were going to call him be elub they
[9:44] were going to calling the devil they
[9:46] were going to make fun of his prophetic
[9:48] Ministry amen but there was a little
[9:50] woman sitting there amen who was a
[9:52] reject of the very world she was in and
[9:56] she had a need so he went there can I
[9:59] just say it real plain that when Jesus
[10:02] is on his way to the Jews in his return
[10:06] he goes by the way of the
[10:08] Gentiles this Gentile bride is out of
[10:12] his way but there's a need in the
[10:14] Gentile church for the Messiah to come
[10:17] to us before he makes it to the Jews and
[10:20] I thank God tonight amen that I am a
[10:23] representative amen I was the woman on
[10:26] the well amen and he had a need to come
[10:29] by my well I wonder tonight if you got a
[10:31] need for him to come by your well do you
[10:33] know he's still alive tonight that same
[10:35] Jesus that walked by that well he can
[10:38] walk right into this church tonight he
[10:40] can walk right into these pews tonight
[10:42] and he can deal with your heart and make
[10:43] you aware he is the same Jesus he is
[10:46] alive amen he's the same God now look at
[10:50] what he was doing here the Bible said he
[10:52] came to this Jacob's Well and Jesus
[10:54] being wear with his journey set th on
[10:56] the well and it was about the sixth hour
[10:59] then he cometh unto a woman of Samaria
[11:01] to draw water and Jesus said unto her
[11:03] give me a drink the disciples were gone
[11:07] so it were just him and her and then
[11:09] saith the woman of Samaria unto him how
[11:11] is it that being a Jew ask a drink of me
[11:15] which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews
[11:17] have no dealings so she goes to the
[11:18] Civil Rights
[11:20] Movement we're going to go to the
[11:22] Prejudice I'm a I'm a colored person and
[11:24] you're a white
[11:25] man now listen do you think it's an
[11:28] accident when Willam br was on the earth
[11:30] in the 60s that it was the greatest
[11:32] civil rights movement in the all of the
[11:35] history of the world Amen there was race
[11:38] rots Martin Luther King Jr it was an
[11:40] entire race battle going on when he was
[11:43] on the earth amen and here is race at
[11:46] that well she's talking about well I'm a
[11:48] Jew you're a Jew I'm a Samaritan amen so
[11:51] immediately race become an issue amen
[11:54] and here we are again with a prophet in
[11:56] the last day with race rights and race
[11:59] issues and Jesus uh said unto her now
[12:03] here's the thing for the woman saith
[12:05] unto him how is it thou being a Jew
[12:07] asked me which am a woman of Samaria for
[12:09] the Jews had no dealing with the
[12:11] Samaritans and Jesus said unto her if
[12:13] thou knewest the gift of God and who is
[12:17] that saith unto thee give me a drink
[12:18] thou would have have asked him and he
[12:21] would have given thee Living Water amen
[12:23] now it's powerful because here's this
[12:25] woman amen and she's very thirsty amen
[12:29] but she don't know because the woman
[12:30] saith unto her him sir thou Hast nothing
[12:33] to draw with and the well is deep from
[12:36] which thou H has living water and art
[12:39] thou greater than our father Jacob yeah
[12:41] amen are you greater than him that gave
[12:43] us this well and drank thereof and his
[12:46] children and his cattle and Jesus said
[12:48] unto her whosoever drinketh of this
[12:50] water thirst again but whosoever
[12:53] drinketh of the water that I shall give
[12:55] him he shall never thirst again but the
[12:58] water that I shall give unto him shall
[13:00] be a well of water springing up into
[13:03] everlasting life and the woman says oh
[13:06] if there's water like that sir give me a
[13:09] drink amen if there's some water tonight
[13:13] that'll take The Thirst out of the Soul
[13:15] give me some of that you because you
[13:17] know really what it is what humans
[13:19] really thirst for they thirst for a
[13:21] living God they thirst to know God's
[13:23] Alive we thirst to know he's not just
[13:26] the god of the Bible or he's the god of
[13:28] a history l or is the god that lived
[13:31] when our parents or our grandparents
[13:32] needed him but is he alive tonight amen
[13:35] are you thirsty to know tonight then
[13:38] there's a water tonight amen if there's
[13:40] a thirst there's an answer because God
[13:42] is rich in Mercy makes himself known to
[13:45] that heart and it brings forth the
[13:48] desire of that well look what she says
[13:51] sir I want some of that water that's
[13:54] what I want some of that water y'all
[13:56] know he's talking about the Holy Ghost
[13:58] amen he just said it it would spring up
[14:00] out of you that's exactly the prophecy
[14:02] of the Holy Ghost shall come out of thee
[14:04] like flowing like rivers of water out of
[14:06] thy bellies and she's being told the
[14:08] Holy Ghost is the water I got for you
[14:11] come on that's the water that come out
[14:13] of the Rock Amen in the desert was the
[14:15] Holy Ghost it was the water they should
[14:17] have got when they spoke to The Rock was
[14:19] the Holy Ghost and let me say this
[14:21] unless you're willing to receive the
[14:23] Holy Ghost you will never quench The
[14:26] Thirst of the human heart but here was a
[14:29] man that could tell her what would
[14:32] answer the depths of her
[14:35] soul oh I tell you I tell you a powerful
[14:39] thing sir give me this
[14:41] water neither come hither to draw Jesus
[14:44] said go call th husband now we're going
[14:46] to teach marriage and
[14:48] divorce look at this now marriage and
[14:51] divorce comes into issue automatically
[14:54] and you know what we find out from this
[14:56] we found out this woman's in shape she's
[14:58] in such a bad shape amen that there's no
[15:01] fixing what she's in there's no fixing
[15:04] what she's in in the church there's no
[15:06] fixing what she's in through the
[15:07] Pharisees there's no fixing what she's
[15:10] in through the religion of her age amen
[15:12] but here's one amen that has a higher
[15:15] thought here is something that's outside
[15:18] religion here is something that's
[15:20] outside the situation she's in and
[15:23] that's really what you got to come in
[15:24] contact with folks you got to get in
[15:26] contact with something that's higher
[15:28] than you do you see that woman was in
[15:31] God's mind before the foundation of the
[15:33] world and the Pharisee couldn't lift her
[15:35] that high and religion couldn't lift her
[15:38] that high but here come one that could
[15:40] take the lowest of lows it take in the
[15:43] middle of a marriage and divorce case
[15:45] and could lift her back in the presence
[15:47] of God he could set her soul of fire
[15:50] when she throw down her bucket and went
[15:52] running come see a man I'll tell you
[15:54] what he could do he could he could Hey
[15:57] listen he didn't say okay listen and
[15:59] you're all messed up in your marriage I
[16:00] got to
[16:04] go now look folks heyen this is the
[16:07] prophet what he did for thou Hast had
[16:10] five husbands and whom thou havest Nots
[16:12] not thine own and thou said us this
[16:14] truly and the woman said unto her him
[16:17] sir I perceive thou art a
[16:23] prophet isn't that
[16:25] powerful I
[16:27] perceive thou are a prophet now watch
[16:30] this because immediately in seeing that
[16:34] he was a prophet I mean immediately the
[16:36] next verse our fathers worshiped in this
[16:39] mountain now she's going to talk about
[16:42] worship we got a prophet now let's talk
[16:44] about worship he worshiped in this
[16:46] mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is
[16:49] the place where men ought to worship and
[16:53] Jesus said unto Heroman believe me the
[16:56] hour cometh when ye shall neither in
[16:58] this Mountain nor in Jerusalem worship
[17:00] the father you worship you know not what
[17:04] we know what we worship salvation is of
[17:06] the Jew but the hour cometh and now is
[17:09] now watch the separation of this there's
[17:10] two Ministries the hour cometh and now
[17:13] is there is the Ministry Jesus now he
[17:15] was talking to her at the well but
[17:18] there's another hour
[17:19] coming there's another son of man
[17:23] Ministry coming in the future the hour
[17:27] cometh but now is is when the true
[17:30] worshippers shall worship the father in
[17:32] the spirit and Truth for the father
[17:35] seeketh such to worship Him amen it does
[17:38] not say the true worshippers worship the
[17:40] father and truthfully speakest and God
[17:42] is a spirit and they that worship him
[17:45] now watch the 24th verse they might
[17:47] Worship in the spirit and truth no that
[17:50] that's a that's a direct word they
[17:53] must see because there is now a definite
[17:58] understanding of how to worship God they
[18:01] must worship see because people's been
[18:03] worshiping but it's been in vain but now
[18:06] he's saying if you want to worship it's
[18:08] not going to be on this mountain and
[18:10] it's not going to be in Jerusalem but
[18:12] you must worship God in the spirit and
[18:15] Truth Now now can I can I give a little
[18:18] history here amen if you get a little
[18:20] history of the Samaritan some people
[18:22] actually believe the Samaritans to be
[18:24] the original 10 lost tribes if you ever
[18:26] heard about the 10 tribes remember God
[18:28] separated Israel they had 12 tribes 12
[18:30] sons of Jacob and they divided them in
[18:33] two tribes and 10 tribes and two of the
[18:35] tribes became Judea which stayed with
[18:38] Jerusalem because of God's promise to
[18:40] David that there would be a seed remain
[18:42] upon the throne so they stayed in
[18:44] Jerusalem but there were 10 tribes that
[18:46] became what you know as Israel and
[18:48] whenever the scripture talks about
[18:50] Nebuchadnezzar coming and carrying away
[18:52] Judah he carried away them at Jerusalem
[18:55] and tore down the temple but the ones
[18:57] that were carried away in Israel were
[18:58] Carri cared Away by the Assyrian army
[19:00] and they were carried in now that's what
[19:02] they talk about the 10 L tribes because
[19:04] they never did see a restoration of
[19:06] Israel the 10 lost tribes well they
[19:08] believe that some of the people from
[19:10] them 10 tribes I don't know if this is
[19:11] 100% accurate this is what they believe
[19:13] but those 10 lost tribes mingled with
[19:16] the heathens and some of them people
[19:18] were half Jew and half Gentile and they
[19:21] called them Samaritans now brother BR
[19:23] teaches us half Jew and half Samaritan
[19:25] so what they did is they had part of the
[19:27] word amen because they were Jews but
[19:30] then there was part of them that had
[19:32] been lost in that time and didn't keep
[19:34] up with the word uh they actually now
[19:36] even today I mean they have it recorded
[19:38] the Samaritan religion itself only has
[19:42] the first five books of of Moses how
[19:45] many how many realizes that the
[19:46] Samaritan just had the first five books
[19:49] of Moses so in other words they had the
[19:50] pen pentatonic of the Bible if you take
[19:53] the first five books of your Bible
[19:55] that's what this woman at the whale had
[19:58] she didn't have amen the the the the
[20:00] time of the Kings and Samuel and Ezra
[20:03] and Nehemiah and she didn't have all
[20:05] those things so in the first few books
[20:08] of the Bible of course Mount gersam was
[20:11] a mountain of blessing which this
[20:13] Jacob's Well was at the foot of Mount
[20:16] gersam where where where Moses had said
[20:19] come from that mountain and put a
[20:20] blessing on the children of Israel but
[20:22] see she didn't have the book of kings
[20:25] and she didn't know that God had used
[20:27] David to move the Ark of the Covenant
[20:29] into Jerusalem and Jerusalem had come
[20:32] the place of worship now it wasn't she
[20:34] wasn't a sincere worshipper she just
[20:36] didn't have all the word amen see what
[20:39] it was she she read up to about 1955 and
[20:42] she never got 1963 she that's the reason
[20:45] she was preaching the prophet had to
[20:46] come back and had Tent Revival and and
[20:48] that's the reason they're teaching all
[20:49] these other things is because they never
[20:51] went into the rest of the word they're
[20:53] good believers they just ain't got the
[20:55] whole
[20:56] message do you see that amen and while
[20:59] they're standing there Jesus is the word
[21:03] he he is the word he is the original
[21:06] word and he's telling her listen there's
[21:08] coming a time it now is and coming that
[21:11] you ain't going to worship like that now
[21:14] what he's doing now is he's setting the
[21:15] order do you see what she says now you
[21:18] Jews say it's Jerusalem amen and they
[21:21] had all the word so it's you Jews are
[21:23] saying that you just teach the word and
[21:25] that's what we're going to need and but
[21:27] us Samaritans say that you just get in
[21:29] the spirit and God will make up for the
[21:31] difference amen and here's a prophet
[21:33] saying no no no you can't just have the
[21:36] spirit and no you can't just have the
[21:38] truth these two have to come together oh
[21:42] Church of the Living God you've got to
[21:44] bring the anointing on the word amen the
[21:47] very word that the Pharisees were
[21:49] reading caused them to crucify Jesus
[21:53] Christ you can't just have the word only
[21:57] you've got to have the spirit
[21:59] that's in the word that it helps you
[22:01] discern the difference between good and
[22:03] evil look at what they do they were
[22:06] rejecting their very Messiah but they
[22:08] were doing it because they didn't have
[22:09] the inspiration on the word of God
[22:12] that's why today people reject the
[22:14] message of the hour amen they reject it
[22:17] because they don't see the inspiration
[22:19] on the word of God Amen when I look at
[22:22] this it says God is a spirit amen I tell
[22:24] you what a revelation to that woman God
[22:27] is a spirit Jesus is breaking the word
[22:29] to her now God is a spirit you got to
[22:32] get that right God is a spirit he not a
[22:34] man come on he's God is a spirit Jesus
[22:38] was the man declaring the spirit but God
[22:41] first is the spirit so how you going to
[22:43] worship a spirit until you get in the
[22:46] spirit you got to get in the spirit to
[22:49] worship The God Who is in the spirit
[22:52] look at what he said and hey man I I
[22:54] love this portion this next portion she
[22:55] says I know the Messiah so now she's
[22:58] tying together a prophet like Moses is
[23:01] the Messiah they were expecting to come
[23:03] and they knew that the Messiah was going
[23:06] to set the order of worship hadn't it
[23:08] already been prophesied there would come
[23:09] an end to their daily sacrifices hadn't
[23:12] it already been told how that there
[23:13] would come a new thing and change and
[23:15] there will be an hour amen but but who
[23:18] was it that set up the Tabernacle Moses
[23:20] who told them how to Camp Moses who told
[23:23] them how to need their bread and how how
[23:25] to walk and how to order their tents and
[23:27] who told them how to put the cups in
[23:29] this place and veil in this place and
[23:31] put the ark over here and put the word
[23:33] Moses ordered the worship and they knew
[23:36] there was coming somebody like Moses and
[23:38] here Jesus was standing there now and he
[23:41] was saying we have come to the end of
[23:44] the Ark of Moses we have come to the end
[23:46] of the laws and we have come to the end
[23:48] of Jerusalem being the place of worship
[23:51] oh but if you want to worship God you
[23:53] can worship Him in America you can
[23:55] worship Him in Africa you can worship
[23:57] him all over the world as long as you
[24:00] get in the spirit you're able to get in
[24:02] the presence of God and you can worship
[24:05] Him amen you don't have to worship God
[24:07] in any certain church I love that God
[24:10] gave us that Revelation You Don't Have
[24:12] To Worship in a certain church I know
[24:14] the Baptist taught us when we left their
[24:16] churches we were going to die and go to
[24:18] hell Pentecostal told us if your name on
[24:20] our book you ain't going to go in the
[24:22] Rapture well there's teachers raised up
[24:24] in the last days if you don't hear me
[24:26] preach you can't go in the Rapture well
[24:28] let me tell you I got my own books I got
[24:30] my own tapes and as long as I can get in
[24:32] the spirit I can find a place to worship
[24:35] brother I can worship in the middle of
[24:37] my trials in the middle of my troubles
[24:39] in the middle of confusion because the
[24:42] spirit of God has been restored in the
[24:45] last days for the church to worship Him
[24:48] who is
[24:50] God he is a
[24:53] spirit how can you worship him until you
[24:57] get in the spirit
[25:03] Jesus had come to
[25:06] prove amen he proved to the people the
[25:09] scriptures he was the Messiah they had
[25:11] looked to
[25:13] come amen but how many of them had their
[25:16] conceptions of him but refused him when
[25:19] he
[25:21] came Jesus didn't come contrary to
[25:24] scripture he come contrary to their
[25:26] teachings the Messiah God didn't come
[25:29] contrary to scripture he came contrary
[25:31] to their teachings and even though he
[25:34] proved by scripture who he was they
[25:36] wouldn't accept the scripture on his
[25:38] life they said well that don't apply to
[25:41] him and that don't apply to him and that
[25:42] don't apply to him and so they would
[25:44] dismiss the scripture so that they could
[25:47] they could reject the Fulfillment of the
[25:50] word Messiah of course had to be a
[25:52] prophet we know the Messiah would be a
[25:55] prophet because of the attributes that
[25:57] followed him do you recognize that God
[25:59] has Supernatural
[26:01] characteristics that's how you recognize
[26:03] God if you you some of you guys in here
[26:06] some of you deer hunters you open this
[26:08] for me it's some of you deer hunters
[26:09] that are in here uh if you ever been out
[26:11] west and seen a mule deer thank you you
[26:14] ever seen a mu deer they don't run like
[26:16] a white tail
[26:18] deer and if you're standing around there
[26:21] you see a you see a mu deer get up you
[26:23] better know the difference because they
[26:26] look a lot alike till they start running
[26:28] am man a white tail he gets low and
[26:30] throws his tail and he's gone but that
[26:33] mu deer hoop like a it it'll hop like a
[26:35] bunny rabbit I mean four-legged hop
[26:37] funniest looking
[26:39] thing amen they're funny looking you
[26:42] seen them it's characteristic of it
[26:45] somebody said somebody said uh well
[26:46] that's a bird what kind of bird was it a
[26:48] red bird you know is it a blue bird it's
[26:51] a bird but what kind and there's a
[26:54] characteristic to God and that
[26:56] characteristic is Supernatural God God
[26:58] is always
[27:00] Supernatural God is always
[27:04] Supernatural cuz he can be he is God so
[27:08] it sets him apart that's the reason when
[27:10] he opened the Red Sea brother R they
[27:12] asked him
[27:14] said he said why do you think why do you
[27:17] think that God had him up the Red Sea
[27:19] like that and and brother B said because
[27:21] God said I'll deliver thee with a mighty
[27:22] hand not Moses he said so God put him in
[27:25] impossible position to identify it was
[27:28] doing the
[27:29] leading and sometimes you get in
[27:31] positions and you say well why am I in
[27:33] this because the supernatural God wants
[27:35] you to know that it's not your pastor
[27:38] doing it it's not one thing it's one day
[27:41] you say well you know this is happening
[27:43] or that's happening or this has happen
[27:44] but here's a prophet now that told a
[27:47] woman 17 different definite things about
[27:50] her life amen I remember brother Ed he
[27:53] counted them I think I've seen you do
[27:55] that amen sat there and counted them
[27:58] amen talk about talk to one woman and
[28:01] talk to her and said I see you laying on
[28:02] the table and I see the doctor he's got
[28:04] I think your kidney in his hand
[28:07] amen come on Amen nobody told him those
[28:10] things amen what was it it was a messiah
[28:13] sign to take you beyond
[28:17] doubt because the Rapture will be a
[28:21] perfect faith it took us Beyond
[28:24] questioning whether it was true or not
[28:27] but it took us in a realm of reality
[28:30] beyond anything a man could think or
[28:32] anything because he was going to declare
[28:34] himself to be the Messiah now have you
[28:37] ever wondered why Jesus showed himself
[28:40] to the woman at the
[28:41] well because there was no scripture
[28:44] pointing to the Gentiles so brother Bram
[28:47] said what he done is he picked the woman
[28:48] at the well he said because she was a
[28:51] mixed race like you Gentiles and she was
[28:53] a
[28:54] harlot so being a mixed raced Harlot he
[28:58] said it was a type of woman at that it
[29:00] was a type of the end time church so the
[29:04] prophecy of him coming to her then was a
[29:07] forecast that he would come to her in
[29:10] the last days see when God chooses what
[29:12] he's going to do amen there's something
[29:14] you find out about God he is an
[29:16] unchanging God with unchanging ways so
[29:19] when you see him do something a certain
[29:21] way you know he's going to do it that
[29:23] way again amen I remember years ago amen
[29:26] I took a little thought on this was
[29:28] really working on Prophecy and and you
[29:30] can look and see amen sometimes it's
[29:32] through the life of Prophecy is what
[29:34] shows prophecy it's not always written
[29:36] but I was standing with my father-in-law
[29:38] we were standing out in a in a field
[29:40] he's he's got this uh Martin box up and
[29:42] he puts this Martin box and he sees this
[29:44] little little Martin fly in there and he
[29:45] said to me he said well there's the he
[29:47] said there's the Scout he said the rest
[29:48] of them be along after a while I said
[29:51] well how do you know that he said cuz
[29:52] they did that last year and you know
[29:55] what they do that every year amen you
[29:57] know what why they do that is because
[29:59] God is in them and he's an unchanging
[30:03] God with unchanging ways and that nature
[30:06] of them do that so if God was poting out
[30:09] now the depths of that I don't have time
[30:11] to preach to you but I'll say this
[30:13] somebody said well to Hey Brother Wayne
[30:14] are are you are you talking about God
[30:17] coming in the church in the last day and
[30:19] I say yeah and people will say well how
[30:21] in the world would he ever use me
[30:23] because he's already chose
[30:24] you what do you mean do you believe that
[30:27] Jesus was virgin born of course he was
[30:30] he was a virgin born born son of God
[30:32] according to the Book of Romans to the
[30:34] to the flesh he was of David and of the
[30:36] spirit he was the son of God and and and
[30:39] and look at Jesus when he picked his
[30:41] family lineage he could have picked
[30:43] anybody but he picked basheba amen and
[30:47] he picked Rahab and he picked Tamar and
[30:51] and you say why why would God pick them
[30:54] because he was picking you he already
[30:57] picked you when he picked them amen you
[30:59] said well God can't use me can he he
[31:02] already has he descended through 42
[31:05] generations and he came through Tamar
[31:08] and he came through basba and he come
[31:10] through Rahab showing that in the last
[31:13] days he would descend again into this
[31:16] generation and he would use men and
[31:20] women
[31:22] brother do you see amen that that mixed
[31:25] up Gentile amen was the only only class
[31:28] left that he hadn't showed himself to
[31:31] but today he was showing himself to the
[31:33] Messiah was being shown to the church
[31:35] somebody say well brother Wayne are you
[31:36] saying the messiah's here I'm saying the
[31:38] messiah's
[31:40] here I'm saying the messiah's here I'll
[31:42] say this William Brandon was not the
[31:44] Messiah he said but the Messiah was
[31:46] talking through
[31:48] him amen if you're expecting to see the
[31:50] Messiah the East and the West have come
[31:53] together the same son that was in the
[31:55] East is here in the west and they have
[31:57] come together I'll say this to you the
[31:59] Messiah is still
[32:01] alive can I say it the Messiah is still
[32:03] alive brother R said it like this he
[32:05] discerned a person he said now if you'll
[32:07] believe me he said then you would have
[32:09] to admit the Messiah is still alive he
[32:11] said now you're responsible to go tell
[32:13] somebody else the Messiah is alive we
[32:16] have found the Messiah we are not
[32:19] looking for him we have found him oh
[32:22] it's a big difference church if you're
[32:24] looking for the answer or if you have
[32:27] the answer
[32:30] if you're looking for the answer can I
[32:31] just point out to you she never asked no
[32:33] more questions she said he told me all
[32:36] things he didn't tell her all things but
[32:38] he let her know she was talking to the
[32:40] Messiah and it answered her little heart
[32:44] I'll tell you this she ran she ran into
[32:46] the City and said come see a man and
[32:48] many were converted because of her
[32:51] testimony I'll tell you this she was a
[32:53] harlot without a voice but she was so
[32:55] influenced by the Messiah side that she
[32:58] became influential and led people to
[33:01] Christ let me say tonight I don't care
[33:03] if you're a widow woman I don't care if
[33:05] you're a little teenage girl you get
[33:07] under the influence of this message and
[33:09] you can lead people to Christ and you
[33:11] can lead people to the Holy Ghost and
[33:14] you can lead people to truth because the
[33:16] influence of this message is so real and
[33:19] so powerful you can set here tonight
[33:22] take your life and begin to surrender to
[33:24] this and influence will come into your
[33:26] life she didn't ask any more questions
[33:29] cuz she didn't have any more
[33:32] questions it was proven beyond the
[33:34] shadow of a doubt and if this is the
[33:37] Messiah the prophet of God I I'll just
[33:39] give you a couple direct quotes as we go
[33:41] along he said he here he is he came to
[33:44] those Shepherds with the greatest
[33:46] message that had ever been given to
[33:47] anybody the messiah's on earth now and
[33:50] he said so is it here he comes with the
[33:52] greatest message and what is the message
[33:54] the Messiah is here now and and to make
[33:58] known do you see the Messiah is here now
[34:01] he's here working through flesh be not
[34:04] afraid he said I'm not the Messiah no
[34:06] other man is the Messiah he is the
[34:09] Messiah but his Spirit dwells in US amen
[34:13] the Messiah not me I'm a man but his
[34:16] Spirit the same anointing that you feel
[34:19] is the Same Spirit that's talking he
[34:21] said it's through the gift Amen in the
[34:24] voice of the sign he said the word has
[34:25] been promised has been made manifest the
[34:27] the Messiah Christ of God is in divine
[34:30] presence somebody said well I want to
[34:32] see the nail scars and the print of
[34:33] thorns Amen in the Millennium you'll see
[34:35] that body but here tonight that wasn't
[34:38] the promise he never promised to come
[34:40] Among Us in the last days in that body
[34:43] he promised we would meet that body he
[34:45] promised we would be lifted to that body
[34:47] amen but he didn't promise nail scars he
[34:50] promised the word of God would become
[34:52] manifest and I say tonight if you're
[34:54] looking for the Messiah if you'll look
[34:56] by the words you'll see him he's right
[34:58] here in the building tonight he's still
[35:00] just as alive as he's ever been listen
[35:03] our God is not dead he is not dead folks
[35:07] he is not in a tomb in Jerusalem he's
[35:10] not in a tomb in Jeffersonville he is
[35:13] the same Jesus right here in this
[35:15] building tonight that he's ever been he
[35:17] is still alive he is still alive he is
[35:22] still real oh I could pray this this
[35:24] morning the same Messiah is here in the
[35:27] Forum of the Holy Ghost now that answers
[35:29] it don't it he's here in the form of the
[35:32] Holy Ghost don't you think John the
[35:33] Baptist pointed him out when he was here
[35:35] and he pointed him out the same as
[35:37] Elijah of this day pointed him out amen
[35:40] now if you can if you see that it's the
[35:42] Messiah then you're going to hear the
[35:44] message
[35:45] differently you're going to hear it
[35:47] differently it's not just a book that
[35:49] you pull down to compare your thought
[35:51] to it's not a commentary that you take
[35:54] your thought and you use this book and
[35:56] use Adam Carton and use William brandom
[35:58] and then you use amen it's not that
[36:00] folks this is the messiah's message and
[36:03] it has come to set the church in its
[36:06] place for the Rapture in the last days
[36:09] this is the highest Authority there is
[36:12] in the land amen and this Authority told
[36:15] us how to worship
[36:16] God if you hear it you hear it different
[36:19] now look brother Bram said it he said
[36:21] the English word God he said that word
[36:23] was the object of worship and he said if
[36:26] you maybe take that speaker you could
[36:28] worship it or you could take this pull
[36:30] pit or you could take your car amen
[36:32] because the English word God would just
[36:34] mean an object you worship but when a
[36:37] Prophet come along he said in the
[36:39] beginning was the word he said now what
[36:41] was before that Hallelujah I like that
[36:44] don't you now what was before that he
[36:46] said you got to see the word God in
[36:48] Hebrew means Elohim which means a self
[36:51] existing one and he existed without
[36:55] anything and before he wasn't even God
[36:59] now that's going back ain't it you're
[37:02] going back to the place before he was
[37:04] worshiped but when he created something
[37:07] he created it to worship Him the Lord's
[37:09] day somebody asked me said brother Wayne
[37:11] what do you think that means do you
[37:12] think John was just meditating or do you
[37:15] think John was just caught in the spirit
[37:16] of Revelation well we got a message see
[37:19] what the prophet said about it not what
[37:22] I think about it what the prophets say
[37:24] about it I'll tell you what brother Ram
[37:25] said about it he said John was out there
[37:28] on that island shouting and dancing and
[37:31] running all over the place amen and you
[37:33] say well what in the world brother man
[37:35] said because he was in the spirit he
[37:37] said and if God did that in Acts two we
[37:40] can only imagine John was under the same
[37:42] spirit that they were in Acts the 2
[37:45] chapter when the spirit fell upon him
[37:47] now I wonder why brother brandham knew
[37:49] that because William brandham had
[37:51] himself been in the spirit a couple
[37:53] times and he'd been running around up
[37:55] there in Revelation around that stone up
[37:57] there in the middle of the mountains and
[37:59] begin to worship God shouting and
[38:02] dancing and rejoicing you know why
[38:05] because they that worship God must
[38:07] worship Him in spirit and in
[38:12] truth he say brother what in the world

[41:46] when I don't worship there ain't no
[41:48] church going to tell me when I worship
[41:51] or when I don't worship I will worship
[41:53] god with the dictates of my heart
[41:56] because he bought me and he saved me
[41:59] somebody said you're fanatical in your
[42:01] worship that's all right the way you
[42:03] call heresy is the way I worship the god
[42:05] of my fathers you wasn't there when he
[42:08] saved this boy you wasn't there when he
[42:11] gave me the Holy Ghost and pulled me out
[42:13] of the fire if he saved you the way he
[42:16] saved me oh you feel like I do when you
[42:19] think about the power and the realities
[42:22] of
[42:24] God now you tell that devil tonight you
[42:27] won't dictate My Worship I'll worship
[42:30] God according to the dictates of my
[42:39] heart I know some of you is in a battle
[42:41] I'm G to close I ain't goingon to preach
[42:42] y'all night I know some of You's in a
[42:44] battle and some of you get to wonder why
[42:46] you in this battle but you know what if
[42:49] you open your Bible sometimes there's a
[42:52] battle happening it's an unseen battle
[42:54] and because you can't see it the devil
[42:56] in darkness devil make it everything if
[42:57] you turn all these lights out and you
[42:59] come over here turn all the lights out
[43:01] and it's total darkness and you could
[43:03] just barely see this m standand he could
[43:06] say that mic stand's a lamp and he could
[43:09] say it's a stick and he could say oh
[43:11] that's a man he could say because in
[43:13] darkness you can say anything but turn
[43:15] the light on and you can see what it is
[43:18] and there's no more questions cuz it's
[43:20] in the light now amen and some of your
[43:22] battles you're going through when you're
[43:24] in the darkness of that battle Satan
[43:26] saying well you did this this and you
[43:27] did that and you did this and this is
[43:29] why this is and this is and because it's
[43:30] in darkness but the scripture brings
[43:33] light to
[43:34] us the scripture brings light you read
[43:36] the book of job and I'm I'm going to
[43:38] hurry but you look at the Book of Job
[43:40] and you see when devil wanted to tempt
[43:42] job he went to God and he said where you
[43:44] been he said I've been down there
[43:45] looking for somebody looking for
[43:48] somebody he said well have you tried job
[43:51] and the devil act like he didn't know
[43:52] who he was but he said well H you got a
[43:55] hedge buil around him so he knew name
[43:58] let me tell you one greater that God
[43:59] knew job's name and I'll tell you what
[44:02] when God knows your name I don't care
[44:04] what else is going on he knows me
[44:07] personally the god of Heaven picked me
[44:09] out of all the people on the Earth and
[44:13] said try my servant Wayne Lawson God
[44:16] Knows My Name
[44:18] personally amen and you know what he
[44:20] told that devil at devil said well I'll
[44:21] tell you why said you got a hedge buil
[44:23] around him but if you let me after him
[44:26] if you let me after after him he' curse
[44:28] you to your face you see what he did you
[44:30] see what the devil did he said that
[44:33] job's worship was so cheap that if just
[44:36] a few bad things would happen that job
[44:39] was turning his back on God he was
[44:41] telling God you're receiving worship
[44:43] only because you're making it good for
[44:45] him you got worship only because things
[44:47] are good you only got worship because
[44:49] this but look at what God told him he
[44:51] said I tell you what you going to do
[44:52] what you want to but he's a perfect man
[44:55] and he's got integrity and after you get
[44:57] done with him he'll still worship me and
[45:00] you know what calamity after Calamity
[45:02] after Calamity started striking job and
[45:05] as it started dring him and it wasn't
[45:06] bad enough it got all the way to his own
[45:08] wife and his own wife said you are to
[45:11] curse God how many knows who the wife
[45:12] was the Messiah said it was the flesh
[45:15] the word of God said it was of job's own
[45:16] flesh begin to accuse him amen and it
[45:19] begin to say to him you need to turn
[45:20] your back on God but in the middle of
[45:23] job's Calamity you know what he done he
[45:25] laid on the ground around and begin to
[45:28] worship God because he told that devil I

[45:34] of car I drive my worship is not
