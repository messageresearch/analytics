guys for coming to Ohio last week and so uh we certainly sorry I didn't get to shake your hand but uh maybe I'll get to this morning so so thank thank you guys for coming Luke 1 and verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into the city of Galilee named nazarus to a virgin ESP spoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in and unto her and said hail Thou Art highly favored and the Lord is with thee blessed art thou of among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what matter of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be called great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end and then Mary said unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated in Luke Chapter 2 and verse verse 8 and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping the watch of their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord came upon them and and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring to you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you born this day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you that ye shall find him the Babe wrapped in SW botling clothes and lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on the earth peace and Good Will toward men and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into the heavens the Shepherds said unto another let us go now even to the unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath known unto has made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and in the Babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad and say which was told concerning this child and all that they heard of it wondered at those things which were told by them the Shepherds but Mary kept all of these things and pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all things which they had heard and seen and it was told unto them amen I'd like to speak to you just for a little bit on by the birth of one Amen in the Garden of Eden the there was a Jesus or God spoke these words and said I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy he thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel I want you to remember this is God's making a promise in the Garden of Eden I will restore amen I will restore I will make this right Thank You Lord the first Adam as he was there and he came to his wife and found her in that condition knew that if God saw her in this condition that he would kill her he would take her and Destroy her and Adam had a choice to make right do I let her die or do I take myself and place my seed on the inside of her and God won't destroy his own seed right so he made a choice brother Brandon would use this statement and forgive me for not having it in front of it he did it with his eyes wide open Eve was deceived but Adam was not deceived and he was acting out what God had placed on the inside of him of redemption but this act as God comes and comes through the garden and they can hear him coming through the garden and he's screaming Adam Where Art Thou God knew where they was at where art thou and listen God didn't send an angel to go find them he didn't send a a great individual of Heaven to go find them God came himself I want you to understand that's important even for this service today God comes to you amen himself and you are so important he won't leave it up to another he comes himself to you every one of our new births are a little bit different some of us met God in a car some of us met God at service some of us sat in our Pew and God came to us some of us walked to the Altar and received a real experience with God but as long as you meet him you will never be the same Adam's fall no doubt as Adam lives over 900 years Adam lived long enough to be able to see the destruction of the fall of Eve the fall of the garden Adam lived long enough to watch nature fall amen where Adam was he never saw a dead leaf withered grass flower petals falling it was a perfect Eden but when Adam fell listen he was he was an amateur God on the Earth but when Adam fell and transgressed remember God told him said the day that you eat thereof that day you die they didn't know what death was death be to set in Adam was now beginning to get stoop shouldered gray hair he was beginning to get wrinkles on his body he was now working by the sweat of his brow he was not speaking the words of like God could speak but now he was working with his hands now he was understanding what death was all about he was seeing his children fight and fuss seeing one be killed murder happened in his family almost immediately let me just say this to Adam as he lives he has to relive the fall over and over again amen let me just say by that act every dead baby right every war every fight over boundaries was Now set against the Garden of Eden but God made a promise God made a promise I will restore I'll bring you back to the Garden I'll bring you back I will make a way listen he was making a testimony when he called them back as they were leav in the garden and he took sheep and took the skins off of those sheep and they gave their life and he wrapped those bloody skins around them because no man no matter how great he is can't pay for his own sin Kings potentates ambassadors smartest people of the world greatest gifted cannot pay for your own sins doctors loyers no matter what your profession is you can't pay for your own sins Rich poor you can't pay for your own sins greatest men in the world would come to live like David but because of the Fall he would become a murderer right are you with me Solomon would marry many wives and go into different types of of of even other kinds of worship and build other Tabernacles even besides the Tabernacle of God every one of these prophets had flaws right that's right are you with me Joseph had a flaw Abraham had a flaw Isaac had a flaw Jacob definitely had a fallaw listen all of these people had flaws in their life but it was a testimony that we needed a redeemer it was a testimony now let me just share this with you before I go any further David no doubt worshiped in the anointing and the praise of God but he knew within himself he needed more that's right listen most listen all of us Le even today need more of him we all need more of him that's our desire evening today I need more why do we need to assemble ourselves in the house of God I don't I don't care how long you've served the Lord but every one of us need that touch from him and listen there's no touch like he can give to your life I kind of want to bring this kind of an odd sort of way cuz when he come to me the other morning and begin to deal with me I thought I've never quite looked at it quite like this Lucifer was responsible for the fall let's place the blame where it has to be the fallen angel from heaven causes all of our problems but he was responsible for the fall God makes a covenant Lucifer being there that old serpent being there when God says I will put enmity between the seat and God literally tells him I'm going to crush you I'm going to crush you now listen you know people say well I don't I don't believe in the serpent seed that one scripture ought to prove it to you by a a that seed they fell but by that seed we're redeemed no doubt oh sloot himself Lucifer watched through the generations of Time for That seed to be born listen No Doubt all the prophets were laying out that he's coming and there was an attribute inside side of himself of this Messiah that was coming small part of God himself imparted in every prophet in every believer and Lucifer was watching because he not only can see in this realm but he can see in the spirit realm no doubt he could see Moses at the burning bush and Lucifer knew that was God he knew that was God no doubt with Ezekiel he could see with a the the wheel within the middle of the wheel he knew that was God no doubt when Isaiah is standing and screaming Behold a virgin shall conceive are you with me now Lucifer could go back and look at what he was told in the Garden of Eden so now he's watching for a virgin to conceive listen it's totally impossible for that to happen but With God all things are [Applause] possible and why would it be so important that she would be a virgin it's CZ he was paying for the sin in the garden and this would not be part Mar and part God it's going to be all God [Applause] Mary gets a visit no doubt in my mind not only did Mary see this happening but no doubt Lucifer was watching cuz he can see in that realm and he's watching now he's got trouble now he's got real trouble because when this child's born it's going to change the whole human race it's no longer be under under the Reigns of death and horror like job talked about but after this baby is born after this baby is born it's going to change humankind are you with me now in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 21 for Since By Man Came Death and by man came also the resurrection of the Dead for for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made Alive Now notice it was saying just a moment ago in Revelations CH 5 and verse one to the Bride of Jesus Christ is very familiar scripture and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written and within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals and I saw a strange Angel a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is Worthy let's ask the question who is worthy to open the book and to look there on listen our names was in the book where they're predestinated listen that's what's important not that you see brother brandom's name in the book or or some great figure in the book you got to see your name and listen the devil will shake you every which way in the world until you see your name in the book and it becomes real to you then it'll be a fight no more then you'll realize I'm as Eternal as he is eternal I came from God and I'm going to go back to God hallelujah I've just described to you the flaw Moses couldn't redeem the book he had a flaw David couldn't redeem the book he had a flaw all the prophets could not redeem the book they had a flaw what about Elijah he took a Rapture but he had flaws right right are you with me he was moody right we have floss we have flws and John realized if there's nobody worthy if there's nobody worthy to come and take the book we're lost and if we're lost life is not worth living we'll live and die like a dog Gabriel couldn't step forth the Angels couldn't step forth but God answered his own Covenant I'll go myself now listen I I want you to think about this God didn't come as a king he didn't come as a great leader cuz Satan would have saw it real quick God hides himself as a baby are you with me he hides himself as a baby sure we know all the supernatural events that are around that from the angel meeting but immediately Satan goes to work to destroy the seat that's what he'll do to you you was enjoying parties you was enjoying life you was enjoying listen it just seemed like life was a breeze and then God ignited something on the inside of you that was in you before the foundation of the world and immediately Satan gets all [Applause] upset immediately he starts Waring with you and it's like you're you're struggling against the water because at one time you were flowing with the stream but now you've turned around brother Ron I'm having trouble you're supposed to but he will come on the inside of you and help you overcome you will never be alone never never never you'll never be alone even in that day governments was involved they placed a taxation now I want you to understand as I spoke to you guys in Ohio God needed Joseph to go to Bethlehem us men are happy with no change it's human nature we don't want our toothbrush moved we sleep on a certain side of the bed we use the same pillow for 42 years Joseph gets news that you you've got to go pay your taxes and you can't do it here you got to go to Bethleham are you with me listen to brother brandham as Joseph as he describes Joseph taking his 9month pregnant wife on a donkey all of this journey and he said he complained the whole time and every bit of it was the will of God God forces change God has a listen this baby cannot be born anywhere else but here and it was not an accident there was no room in the church world he had to be born in a manger or a barn [Applause] and God arranges it that Shepherds think about it listen to I'm I'm I'm putting a lot of sermons together now brother br's the greatest Christmas sermon preacher that there is listen God arranges it not to go to Kings to come visit him in a Manger Kings will come two years later but God arranges it that shepherds abiding on the field watching over their block Calla Shepherds who has the smell of sheep on [Applause] them they have the smell of sheep they understand the nature of sheep they'll be comfortable in this Barn there's a lot of people that will go to church on Christmas or Easter and if we have anybody here that's just Christmas and and Easter Easter worshippers we'll see you next Easter I don't think we have any of them but maybe we'll do it on the internet and we'll see you next Easter now I want you to just notice I'm sure it was heart-wrenching to put your wife in a barn and knowing that baby's coming Their Stars the Bible of the heavens has come together and the Messiah sign is shining three major stars have come together to announce in heaven that that baby's being born on the Earth Magi are watching they're watching something's happening Messiah is being born on the Earth Heavens is testifying brother BR said the heavens are testifying that there's an infant Bride on the earth 1962 Heavens has testified that you are here not just Israel in her home and not just Israel fighting for her boundaries not just because our government has went hawi and Sodom and Gomorrah is Among Us you have come listen when brother brandham was here there was no message churches come on are you with me brother Ram had his own Tabernacle and there was churches that he went to that was Pentecostal or Full Gospel that he preached to there was no churches a symbol like this but the the message would be preached men would grab the message and begin to deliver the word because this had to be born on the inside of you this was not just for brick and mortar and stone and walls this message had to live in human vessels in the manger of your [Applause] heart God's not satisfied with libraries with a name on it hospitals with a name on it God wants to live in the temple of your heart as this baby's born coming from her womb it was just like any other mother given birth there was screams and I'm sure in another realm there was screams happening he's arriving he's arriving I love that song it was just sung just a moment ago Mary did you know your baby boy would walk on water Mary did you know when you kissed that baby you've kissed the face of God Amen nobody knew like she knew nobody knew like she knew Joseph wasn't there when the angel spoke that's right but she knew I have great admiration for our sister Mary cuz a lot of people had rumors about her and a and a Roman soldier I had a man tell me he said it was a Roman soldier's baby I said show me another Roman soldier that had that kind of effect show me another soldier that had that kind of effect on the earth this baby came from God God left the portals of heaven I'm talking about God left the portals of Heaven sure God fills all time space and Eternity but God is so great he can become a [Applause] baby and hide him s from the kings of the earth a baby is helpless a baby can't feed itself but God placed himself in a mother that could take care of him that could watch him through life's journey and know who he was let me just say people say well I I just don't like Christmas I don't like anything about the Catholic Christmas come on S Santa Claus is not real come on you know there's times I wish he was real cuz I got a list and there's times brother Marcus that I know I made the naughty list but let me just say this about this Jesus he is real listen I do not need history to prove that he was real I don't need archaeologist to dig up things to prove that he's real he's real in my heart [Applause] Shepherds find them way their way following the star God's greatest Compass they come into the place where he's at and worship him they don't have to wait till he's 30 years old they come in worshiping him listen They too had had a supernatural visitation angels of God came and met them they knew who to go to heaven sung voices echoed out of the heavens that God is born on the Earth Adam fell and caused all death but this baby being born causes all life well what does that mean to me brother Ron as a Christian you don't die you don't die brother Ron but that just that's just not possible I'm not looking at this Earthly realm I'm not talking about your body that may have to go to a nursing home or may have to lay for Years or or may have to get out of a out of a hospital bed to spend his last day on a floor with a grandson listen my grandfather had been a bad man for so long but the last five years of his life he was a Christian listen his body may have went into the ground your body might go into the ground let me just say oh brother on about I'll be so disappointed if I go by the way of death let me just say it's like an Uber taxi are you with me now it's your gateway from this Dimension to that Dimension we will not die disappointed we will not die defeated we'll step into a wellbody and in a matter of moments stand never to be touched by cancer ever [Applause] again they went to the temple on the eighth day for the circumcision I'm going to read this to you for a moment brother Brandon says it see reaches over and takes the baby out of the mother's arms and raises his hands and said God let your servant depart in peace according to your word for my eyes has seen the salvation and way back over in the corner an old blind woman named Anna she was a prophetess Anna was a prophetess and she had been blind for years and she sat there and she has always waited and believed on the consolation of Israel she believed that that Prophet was coming and she was believing and she was sitting there and the Holy Ghost said Anna stand up those that are spiritual are always LED you know at the right time stand up Anna and here comes that old blind woman pardon me sir pardon me pardon me Madam I'm sorry led by the Holy Ghost where are you going Anna I don't know I'm just being led and the first thing you know she comes right straight to where Simeon is standing and saying Lord let thy servant depart in peace and she likewise the Holy Ghost Came Upon her and she began to prophesy about the chur oh brother or sister if the Holy Ghost could lead a blind woman in those those kind of times how much more could he lead us today although we are becoming blind let the HIM lead us back to the Fountain I love this part there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins where Sinners plunged beneath the flood lose all their guilt STS when the first news came to Glory that the son had been lost Adam did God send an angel did he send a son did he send someone else he came himself Amen to redeem his lost son God didn't trust it with no one but himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and redeemed man we are saved the Bible said by the blood of God you talking about a Christmas gift you're talking about a Christmas gift it's greater than than a sweater that you probably can't can't wear in two years are you with me it's greater than a gun it's greater than a ball this Christmas gift is eternal that's the immortal God was made Mortal in order to take away sin to be the lamb himself to enter into Glory veiled with his own blood before him Beyond the Veil Harvest time he said like he did in the second Adam after Adam fell he began to raise a second Adam and the second Adam fell then it was taken up the first Adam fell in sin and stayed there the second Adam fell to redeem man I needed Redemption amen I don't care hear who who you are you need to be saved I don't care who you are I don't care what letters that they put behind your name you still need to be saved this week brother Matthew and myself we were in Illinois and I was I was with him and we're staying in a hunting place and and he's laying on one side of the room in a bed and I'm laying on the the other side of the bed and and I said Adam I said Matthew I know you don't remember this but but you were stood about that tall little bitty fella cotton top hair I was chopping wood behind Daddy's Barn because we didn't have a Woods splitter and I was chopping wood and here you got away from Mom and you got out there where I was and and you stood beside of me while I was chopping wood and I looked down and I remember it was like yesterday I said Matthew I picked him up in my arms and I said Matthew we'll always be buddies amen I heard him sniffling over there a little bit I'm not just talking about father and son there's another father there's a high father that's watched over our lives God had Mary there to pick him up when it would Calla scars on his hands and fall in the dirt and a grapples when he would get sick as a baby had Joseph there to hide him in Egypt to protect him from brutal kings that was trying to destroy that son that had come to the Earth listen because this baby came to the Earth Generations died they killed every male baby abortion just didn't start yesterday it started in Egypt they tried to kill that one that was coming that Prophet Moses that was coming and God had to hide Moses right under Pharaoh's nose listen when Jesus come generations of young men died right cuz Satan was trying to abort the Messiah coming let me just say God's got a promise to you and there's nothing that the devil can do to stop what God nothing nothing forgive me for getting excited it's worth getting excited about it's absolutely worth getting excited about he's watched over you so brother Ron what about watching over me I can take care of myself really really really you can take care of yourself without God you can't breathe the next breath of air well brother Ron life's been so hard I've got nothing to be thankful for really if you're the P the poorest person in this building you still got a whole lot to be thankful for are you with me it doesn't matter your wealth we've all got a lot to be thankful for my prayer this year might be different in a lot of your prayers but my prayer has been answered let me live to see Christmas I'm thankful I'm thankful but let me say you a lot of people are terminal and they don't realize it you don't realize it but whether you're terminal or not you

prison hard prison hard labor camps for four years how many people would it give up and recanted when it got hard they just recanted I can't do this anymore I don't care how hard life is this is worth fighting for in the words of a prophet he said God wrapped himself in this Christmas gift said unwrap him today unwrap him brother Ron but I've been a Christian 10 years 20 years 30 years 40 years I

I want to hear from [Applause] God let me just finish this this morning by the birth of this one by the birth of this one Paul could say death where's your sting at grave where's your Victory he could say to be absent from this body is to be present with the Lord Peter could say don't let me be crucified like my Lord turn me upside down they can hedge me cut off the martys of the of the book of 68 million Christians given their life for Jesus Christ the moment they die is the moment that they live what did this gift mean to you it took old dirty habits that I couldn't get rid of I washed them away it took my family histories and your family histories the penalties that was falling down on us and we don't have to pay for their sins thank you Lord it means we don't have to pay for prayer it means we don't have to count rosary beads come on it means that we don't have to pay for to get our loved ones out of purgatory Hallelujah we can sing the song Thank God I am [Applause] free when we heard the song just a moment ago down from his glory ever living story my God and savior came and Jesus was his name born in a manger oh my God God didn't need a pink hospital room to be born in a manger suited him very well because he was a lamb the Lamb of God one more thought Adam watched Abel tie of Vine around the lamb Cain had a beautiful Altar and he built it by all his works but it didn't work that's right come on but Abel took a Vine and put it around that lamb and pulled it to a rock and put it up on that rock and begin to take a sharp Stone and offer it to God Amen listen without because of children here let me just say that lamb died for Abel and then after God received his offering the jealousy of his brother right because of who his father was right caused him to die on the same Rock for all of that this baby has to be born right to revoke the jurisdiction of Satan amen because there was a lot of things against you God said I'll pay for it I'll pay for it Ron I'll pay for your s I'll go to hell so you don't have to [Music] I'll go to hell listen if you really knew if you were on the on the edge today and said I don't know which way to go 10 seconds in hell
