that was done towards the family during the loss of brother Roger a scripture that comes to mind of our our brother Roger is is first Thessalonians 4 And1 and it says and that you study to be quiet and to do your own business and to work with your own hands as we commended you and in another translation it would say aspire to lead a calm and peaceful life as you mine your own business and earn a living I find this uh scripture that would uh be a life that brother Roger would live a man that would mind his own business and worked a calm and Peaceable life with his family and and so we certainly loved our brother Roger and the life that he shared with us and his family and and how that he taught us those things maybe this morning like to sing a couple songs with us maybe we'll stand together and sing these congregational He Knows My Name I have a makeer and he form my heart and before even time began my life was he you his hand and he knows my name and he knows my every thought

certainly want to extend our condolences to Sister Vicky and The shifflet Meadows family we appreciated brother Roger and everything he stood for his glorious message that he believed with all of his heart we know that this isn't the end we know this is just a temporary goodbye but Jesus Promised if you believe on him you would have eternal life and we look around nature and all of Nature and all of creation tells us that there's coming a resurrection and we believe it with all of our hearts because he raised brother Roger will also raise you know an important thing in life is just not what we accomplish or what we do the important thing is in life is to know him and the power of his resurrection it's not just about knowing facts is not just about knowing a Doctrine Jesus Christ is life that's right and heaven and all these things that we're so looking forward to is more than a geographical Place Heaven is a person love is a person it's not an idea it's not just a state of mind it is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and if you don't know him in the power of his resurrection I just want to encourage you this afternoon to know him because to know him is life and God is so simple he came and he gave his life so that if we believe on him that's all that's all he asked us to do is to believe on him brother Roger believed on him and he's promised the resurrection just like we're

we we welcome you here to Full Gospel Lighthouse and I want to thank each and every one of you for coming here today to be a part of this Celebration Day for our brother Roger shifflet and uh he's certainly certainly loved here at Full Gospel Lighthouse and you think about brother Rogers life and think how we how he come to the message and think about the family that he was in you you really see the the character of a of a person by the person that they marry and you see you see in Sister Vicky's life and you see how that how that God has orchestrated her life so so perfectly and how that he thought so much of brother Roger that he would allow her to be connected with brother Roger and to see the life that they they built here and to live right here in the valley and to be a witness and to be a written epistle read of all men and we certainly uh we love brother Roger with all of our heart and he certainly meant a lot to our our former Pastor brother Homer Frasier and then myself and brother Ron and and uh we just we just think about how powerful that sister Vicky is and in her own walk when you think about brother Roger marrying her and later on in life and sister Vicki now has went through this uh losing of her husband twice and you think about how that how that God has orchestrated all of these things and you just see how that the Lord worked every detail out for sister Vicki and brother Roger their life and what a testimony that it is and you think about sister Vicki's faith and to see and I I know that just take a moment here and speak on sister Vicky but I believe it's exemplary for us to recognize the character uh sister Vicki that brother Roger was married to because it exemplified his as well it showed the character that was on the inside of him when he married sister Vicky and to think how powerful that she is I know that when brother Kenny passed away that that even she was that night she was back there in the house of the Lord after that and I know that she got on her kids just past this past week cuz they left a a tent meeting just to come back to be with her and they wanted she wanted them to be in church but I think it's I think it's very powerful the family that brother Roger was connected to here the shifflet family and The Meadows family and you see what God was doing God was joining two families together and I was just praying about this this week what what could I what could I say that I could offer to the Diaz and the the Huffman family and the shifflet family just just reflecting over brother Rogers life and this scripture just kept coming to me Matthew chapter 10 and verse 29 are not Two Sparrows sold for a far then one of them shall not fall on the ground with without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear ye not therefore you are more a Val you than many sparrows and Jesus goes on to say whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven but whosoever shall deny me before men him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven brother Roger definitely lived the life of the first of one that would confess him before men brother Roger was not ashamed of this of this gospel this glorious gospel that came by his way and when you think about when you begin to think about how careful God is in choosing and electing Sons and Daughters of God and you think about the election of God how that he would elect somebody that would stand for him in an hour like we're living in right now and to think that no matter what came no matter what the storms were that rose up against brother Roger was steadfast in his faith and Jesus is Jesus is saying so don't worry don't worry for your father cares deeply about even the smallest detail of your life and I think about just the the moments of life that we are chosen that God has given us to be able to live out and you think about it that God so instrumentally puts things together that God is saying to you that don't worry about the smallest detail of life I've got my eye upon the sparrow you think about that if God's got his eye upon the sparrow the smallest one of the smallest birds that surely God cares about his children surely you would think that God knows every little detail that even when brother Roger was dealing with conditions in his body God knew every little detail of it we think about when God was when he was here on Earth that he cared so much for the people that he came and he healed their sick that he comforted their heart and he told them about a place that he was going to go to prepare for them and that he would come again to them and receive them unto himself he cared so much for them and notice he cared so much until when he knowed he must leave in order to bring this great thing to us he said I not leave you comfortless but I will send the Holy Spirit and he shall continue my care for you until he returns there's nobody that cares like Jesus even when his disciples were up out there on the waters and they were out in the storms of life and they were out there and it looked like Jesus didn't see them God saw them we recognize that if you go to studying the scriptures that Jesus had went up onto a mountain to pray and there we recognize that Jesus was up there and all the time when his children were in the midst of troubles and in the midst of Trials he seen them sister Vicki he saw this day before it ever got here he saw saw the day that brother Roger would die he saw that and G Jesus cared so much that he came down off of the mountain and walked upon the Water he cared so much for them that he calmed the water as he began to walk upon it and he began to talk as he began to speak to them said fear not it is I and in the darkest of hours that's when Jesus shows up that's the kind of God that brother Roger believed in he believed in a kind of a God that would show up in sickness he would show up in troubles he would show up in depression he would show up in the calamities of life and that kind of God cared so much for brother Roger that he wouldn't leave him here in a pest House of of of a body that would begin to be tormented by age and things that kind of God cared so much for brother Roger that just the other day he would come and call his name and the angel of death would sweep into the room and would catch and pick a flower that go could put in his bouquet he cared so much that he came by the way of the shifflet and he called one home it's the same kind of God that cared so much for Lazarus that day when he walked by when he walked by the the by the land that Lazarus was living in and he passed away but Jesus cared so much to be late because he knew that he would show up for his resurrection he cared so much about Lazar Aus that he wept at his funeral he cared so much for Mary and Martha that he looked on them and said I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live again he cared so much for Lazarus that he spoke the word Lazarus come forth you see in life he cares for you in death he cares for you in rejoicing he cares for you and in Weeping he cares for you and brother Roger was a Serv V of the most high God that cared about the smallest of details maybe key of C or key of f sister gie he carth for you oh he carth for you oh through sunshine or shine oh he cares for you oh he carth for me oh he carth for me oh through sunshine or sh oh he carth for me as our pastor brother Ron comes let's just sing that to G he carth for you oh he carth for you [Music] oh through sunshine or shine all for you God bless you I'm so honored to stand here before you today and greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I'd like to thank you for being here it just kind of shows what a man that Roger was for all of us to be here today and all of us have been affected by his life and and uh I was his Pastor for right at 25 years and and uh we're talking you know we kind of have a hard time talking about sister Vicky without talking about Kenny and brother Homer thought so much of Kenny uh Kenny was an angel on the earth and and uh we double dated he didn't trust me but he trusted Kenny and so we we spent much time with you guys in your home and then God gave you brother Roger and when the Lord took brother Kenny home he gave you brother Roger I'm sorry that you have to face this again sister Vicky but isn't it wonderful to know the end of the story brother Roger's children and his stepchildren you know his family thank you thank you for being here this is not the end we watched brother rogers's body deteriorate we knew him as a strong strong man we knew him as a great worker and uh having a good business uh my my bedroom is even painted by Brother Roger now and as I woke up this morning looking up at it brother Joe and looking up at the The Strokes on the brush you know I thought well he's still here his work still is here whether we live a short time or whether we live a long time we're known by our work and our work follows us it creates a legacy for us and if we do bad work it's always there there's a story there's a saying that says if you do good work you'll tell seven people somebody does bad work they'll tell they'll tell 48 people Roger was a guy that did good work and and uh he painted this church over and over again he did a lot of work here and helping to keep things going Roger was the kind of guy that this church could be bopping and the walls the walls sweating and with the shouts of the glory of God and hundreds shouting here and Roger was sitting still enjoying it all you know I never I never saw him shout I I never saw him jump I never saw him scream you know when I got a call from Brother Roger I got a few of them as being his Pastor I always knew he had something to tell me because I'd sat with him at tables and and having dinner and he never said a word you just you carried the conversation how many how many of you knew him that way yeah I I know that he and sister Vicky had no issues CU he didn't talk so for you to have trouble somebody's got to be the talker we loved him we loved him with all of our hearts and if we could stand here and congratulate him today we'd like to say congratulations on a job well done amen and uh he will be deeply missed here at this audience and we loved him with all of our hearts a couple of weeks ago he was sitting in the back because he didn't feel like coming down little did we know that that would be his last service here for him to struggle to get in and then struggle to leave and sister Connie would speak with him for for a few minutes there and talk to him and he would tell her that he wasn't feeling well the other day when when when and we heard he was in tough shape I went to the house there on Friday afternoon and and I went into the room with him and and uh he was in really bad shape and weighing about 110 PBS and I grabbed a hold of him and hugged his body and he did his very best to hug me and I begin to pray for him and and tell him that Roger I'm not the the last guest that you're going to see there's a guest that's going to walk into this room and you've been looking for him for a long time you know for a pastor to walk into someone knowing that this will probably be the last time you see them and there's a prayer that you begin to pray for them just to let them know that death is not nothing for a Christian to be scared of now if you're not a Christian you ought to be really terrified but if you're a Christian the Lord Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also as I have instructed these guys that are sitting behind us one of the ways that you'll know is when a when a saint is getting ready to go home there's a always a warm presence that's already attending the the saint that is getting ready to go and you can feel that warm presence and it's getting ready to take that child of God home I'm thankful F I'm thankful that there is a land beyond the river I'm thankful that there's more than just being born and being raised up as a little child and going to school and you know life is Tough Enough on its own it's very difficult we look around in this crazy generation that we're living in and there's chaos everywhere some of the most smartest people in the world is having having all kind of chaos presidents don't know what to do dictators don't know what to do it only shows that there's a tribulation period that is setting in but there is a Lord Jesus that's made us a promise you see he's turning from the Gentiles and he's headed toward the Jews now and there's a Rapture that's on setting brother Roger got just a little Glimpse he got a little bump before our our Rapture he'll come back to see us along with all of our loved ones and we'll see him and I'm looking forward to that day to shaking his hand not as a man standing in a decrepit body not a man that's struggling to make a step in front of another step and struggling for breath and struggling for situations but a man that's standing there totally well in Psalms chapter 46 it's says God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountain shake and the swelling thereof there is a river and the streams thereof whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacle Les of the most high God is in the midst of her and she shall not be moved God shall help her and and that right early the Heathen raged and the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice and the Earth melted the Lord of host is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge Revelations chap 21 tells us of our future we all know our past past but I like our future and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God God shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death what a place there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and I will give unto him that is a thirst of Fountain of Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son I stand here as an executor of the whe today I have no clue what brother Roger owned I don't have any I don't have any idea what he had in the bank I'm not a nosy preacher and it's plain none of my business but I want to tell you today Roger shiplet was rich am yes Lord he was rich he was richer than every president we've ever had he was richer than every General that has stood for the United States of America he was richer than anybody in Hollywood and he's definitely richer than all the congressmen and Senators that we've got there I would say at least 98% of them he owned eternal life and when you're a possessor of eternal life how can we lose I was being pushed three weeks ago from from from the emergency room having a massive heart attack to the cath lab and the guy that was taking me he said did you get a kiss from your wife I said yeah he said I mean a real kiss from your wife a real hug from your wife I said yeah it'll do he said you may not come back down this Hall you may not live to come back down this Hall I said listen I'm a winner I'm okay I'm okay and I was having a massive heart attack fighting stage four cancer but I'm okay he I'm okay let me just say this to you but some of you are not amen that's why we have services like this to remind ourself we come to a spot to where life the heart TI ticks no more and we're all one breath from eternal life but if my heart would kick off even while I'm speaking to you I'm okay I'm okay are you all of us have trouble Christians have trouble all of us have trouble all of us face calamities and great diffic difficult difficulties none of us have ever had a day like job had it's the oldest book in the Bible but none of us have had a day like job had he lost it all he lost his wealth he lost his children he lost his family even his wife would turn against him and begin to tell him why don't you Curse God and die you see he didn't realize that there had been a a meeting with God and and his enemy and his enemy had said you know what can I do with job can I get to him and he said I've been searching to and fro in the earth seeking whom I may devour and God asked him have you considered my servant job I sure have but you got to hedge about him I can't get to him aren't you glad that God protects you aren't you glad that God protects you and Satan said well when I when I when I put my test against him he'll curse you and die but God had so much confidence in him you do what you you want to with him but he he'll stand the test Roger had some test in his life he had some incredible test in his life a Man shows what he is when he goes through test you know job had lost his family he had lost his wealth now his physical body was in a wreck his friends were making front of him saying he was a sinner and now his wife was asking him why don't you first got and die I want to take you to a conversation I won't hold you long but I want to take you to a conversation God came and visited job wouldn't you appreciate it that God would come and visit you God would come now let me just say this to you whether it be a president or a queen whatever you'd be incredibly impressed that they would take the time to come and visit you but the creator of heavens and earth and all the busyness of Eternity came to a man named Joe now when God came to this man he didn't talk to him not one sentence about all that he was going through he didn't talk to him about a pity party that he was having he didn't talk to him about all that he' lost he didn't talk to him about his family he didn't talk to him about how he would rebuild his business as a matter of fact he didn't talk to him anything about temporary situations he talked to him about eternity and he began to talk to him and he said where was you job when I laid the foundations of the Earth where was you at form the mountains and form the universe he was reminding him that I had you in eternity I got you now and I will always have you I'm thankful that there is a God that knows knows our past knows our present and knows our future aren't you glad of that maybe you would like to question the Angels what's the greatest thing that you've ever seen what's the greatest treasure that could you could ever have maybe we could ask Gabriel today of all that you have saw God do what would be the greatest treasure that you could talk up to me about eternal life eternal life Abraham you as a young man that got old and God came and visited you turned you back to a young man again but you would get old again and and pass away Abraham what would be your greatest treasure that you could talk about run eternal life eternal life would be the greatest treasure brother Ron what what's the difference if you live to be 25 years old and you don't have eternal life you're not such a rich man Jesus would make the comparison if a man gained the whole world and lose his soul what profit him Napoleon came very close to Conquering the whole world but he couldn't conquer himself so if you gain the whole world and you lose your soul you don't have what Roger had you don't have what Roger had and Roger sat quietly and humbly and was a phenomenal man but today standing somewhere in a young body enjoying Fellowship how do you know that brother Ron Jesus was having a a conversation with his disciples and no doubt Jesus is getting ready to go away these disciples could not understand what Cal is getting ready to happen or even when he is about to be beat like no other man was ever to be beat Jesus has a conversation with his disciples and he tells them let not your heart be troubled you believe in God I'm going to go and prepare a place for you you that where I am there you may be also he wasn't talking about brick and stone and rock and mortar he was talking about a new body he was answering job's question if a man die shall he live again you know sometimes we think well brother Ron we shouldn't be too noisy in church we should be quiet well I I wonder when Jesus opened up Abraham's bosom and all those people were LED captivity captive throughout the Old Testament and was set free Abraham and Moses and Jeremiah Nehemiah that had been held captive by death all of this time and now the greatest champion that would ever live open those Gates I would imagine there was a celebration like never before and I end today with this brother Roger I never saw him too emotional here but I'd say he's quite emotional in that other realm and I'd say he's going to be quite emotional when it comes back to this realm just before our Rapture and to go home to meet the Lord in the air for where we're going we'll never have a another memorial service we live in one of the most beautiful places on Earth the shanor valley Roger got to live here his life he watched the leaves as they would turn and God would paint nature all of the beauty that we have here but that's death it's telling us that Winter's coming I used to be a redheaded guy blood red hair I really didn't like it until I got white hair and I wish I had blood red hair again but this is telling us that this body is headed back to the ground if there's not a rapture this is telling me as I get up in the morning and fight and try to live and Fight For Life there'll be a day where I don't take chemo no more there will be a day where there's no more leaves turning different colors I want to tell you of our future the there's a future home and it looks real good oh and here's what I want to ask you I don't want one of you to miss it God won't send you to hell right he's not that kind of a God he sends nobody to Hell well who does brother Ron the man in the mirror the man in the mirror sends you to Hell brother rbot I didn't have a chance when you're going down the road and you hear an old gospel song and it begins to speak to your heart when you see a poem or you see a scripture on the sign it sended you a message when the preacher preaches at a funeral it's your opportunity not what with we do with what our life's passed cuz that's done we can't do anything with that but what about your future what about your future brother Ron I'm a really mean man yeah I know all of us were amen I got a lot of wickedness in my life all of us had that but Jesus came nobody thought the founding pastor of this church would ever be a preacher but Jesus came when I was a little boy there was a man that sat in our church and he was about 72 years old and he had sat there his son-in-law was the pastor of the church where we attended in Christiansburg and he sat there all of those years and we liked him because he always told Sports stories and he always had candy and was just a pleasant guy to be around he always sat on the back row he never never really got into any service that I ever saw him it was a Wednesday night I watched Marvin Porter slip out of the back of that building and walk past about 700 seats and walk up and do something he had never did before and he gave his heart to the Lord amen I was the last one to see him too and I wrapped my hands around him and before the Lord came and took him home but from 72 till his late 80s I never saw a man that passionate to serve the Lord Jesus would do that for every one of you I've watched him I found him to be real I found him to be more than a picture on the wall but I found him to be real true I found him to be honest now let me say this to you he will never let you down amen thank you Lord when he walked in Sister Vicki s Saturday Roger knew everything in my life was worth it am for Jesus to Walk in the room I'll be really honest with you I don't want the other guy walk in my room
