[24:44] amen i'm so thankful
[24:47] that he's got us his children by his
[24:49] hands
[24:51] to know that he is upholding us by his
[24:54] right hand of power
[24:56] leading us through the night what a what
[24:59] an honor it is
[25:00] to have him in the middle of our storms
[25:03] holding us up and
[25:06] bringing us before the father and
[25:09] taking us by the hand and leading us
[25:12] through
[25:14] i remember one time when i was
[25:17] i was facing some real inner battles and
[25:21] just you know how the enemy faces you
[25:24] and
[25:24] he battles in your mind things and i was
[25:28] facing some real things and the enemy
[25:31] was
[25:31] just trying to whisper lies in our ears
[25:34] and
[25:34] i mean you know how he does it's what he
[25:37] does best and
[25:40] the spirit of the lord came and spoke
[25:42] through a man and
[25:44] i was standing right in that corner and
[25:46] he
[25:47] and he spoke and said i've had you in my
[25:50] hands the whole time
[25:53] and to know that that god has had each
[25:55] and every one of us in his hands
[25:57] the whole time our whole life and to
[26:00] think about the things that we've went
[26:01] through
[26:02] we can look back over our lives and
[26:04] think about the things that we're facing
[26:06] now
[26:06] and realize that our life is in his
[26:09] hands
[26:10] what a wonderful wonderful god that we
[26:12] have we
[26:13] so appreciate him for being our father
[26:16] we're so thankful
[26:17] for our earthly mothers this day we're
[26:20] certainly
[26:21] wishing each and every one of you
[26:23] mothers if you were here today
[26:25] in this service after this service we
[26:27] would normally be handing you
[26:29] a flower or some type of goodie but
[26:32] we're not able to do that today but we
[26:35] are
[26:35] wishing you all a very happy mother's
[26:38] day today and
[26:40] we wish it to be the best but not only
[26:42] this day but every day and
[26:44] we realize that mothers are the fifth
[26:47] gospel
[26:48] when when when they're not in when your
[26:51] children are not
[26:51] in church they're being you as a mother
[26:55] are preaching to them at home and
[26:57] leading them in the fear and admonition
[26:59] of the lord so that's
[27:01] what a wonderful privilege that mothers
[27:03] have been given to be
[27:05] the in-house preacher to to instruct the
[27:08] children
[27:08] in the home and so we're certainly
[27:10] wishing you all a very happy
[27:12] mother's day and if you have not wished
[27:14] your mother a mother
[27:15] a happy mother's day no matter how
[27:18] difficult it is
[27:19] it's still the right thing to do no
[27:21] matter how bad the situation is
[27:24] wish your mother a happy mother's day
[27:26] we're certainly
[27:28] certainly thankful for the news we got
[27:30] this past week
[27:31] some of you have seen it by the way of
[27:34] social media or whatnot but brother ron
[27:36] we
[27:36] told you last weekend that brother ron
[27:38] was due for
[27:40] for a brain scan on tuesday
[27:43] we asked for a good report and we got a
[27:45] good report
[27:46] brother ron this scan was on tuesday
[27:49] there and they
[27:50] told him that they did not need to see
[27:53] him for three months
[27:54] and so we say thank you jesus and we're
[27:57] expecting the same thing
[27:59] on tomorrow morning asking for
[28:02] a supernatural god to show up and he's
[28:05] the god that created the
[28:06] the entire being and so we're just
[28:09] asking that he would take control
[28:11] over over brother ron's body
[28:14] and completely clear the scans and made
[28:18] the x-ray of the holy spirit just
[28:20] over oversee him and minister life to
[28:23] him
[28:24] we cursed the enemy the life of it and
[28:27] we've told that enemy where he belongs
[28:30] and where he is to go
[28:31] and we have committed this need before
[28:33] the lord and when we commit something to
[28:35] the lord we don't take it back out of
[28:37] his hands we leave it there
[28:39] so we just want to be remembering
[28:41] brother ron tomorrow
[28:43] it is a very big day in brother ron's
[28:46] life
[28:46] and in each and every one of your lives
[28:48] because we understand the circumstances
[28:51] of things
[28:52] but we have prayed we have asked for a
[28:54] miracle our theme this year has been god
[28:56] is with us and we
[28:58] will see miracles and i believe that we
[29:00] have to me
[29:01] tuesday was a miracle to see that
[29:04] you know we've had 19 weeks of bad news
[29:07] brother ron got up as a champion last
[29:10] weekend on
[29:11] on ring the bell and he rung the devil's
[29:14] bell
[29:15] last weekend and then god came behind it
[29:17] with an amen and gave him a
[29:19] clear report so we're asking that god
[29:21] would come behind this
[29:23] and give a clear report we know that
[29:25] he's god and you know that he's more
[29:27] than able
[29:28] i would like to thank brother allen this
[29:30] morning
[29:31] for stepping up to the plate and being
[29:34] the song leader for us this morning
[29:37] brother alden is one of these days
[29:39] probably going to kill me for all the
[29:40] things that i've put him through
[29:42] i have done i've put in
[29:46] some situations before and uh i'm
[29:48] certainly privileged to have brother
[29:50] alden as
[29:52] it's no secret he's one of my best
[29:53] friends and one of my closest friends in
[29:55] confidants and
[29:57] and uh i i've been blessed on this earth
[30:00] to have brother out and as my friend
[30:02] and and the deacon here at this church
[30:04] to to
[30:05] oversee to be the police officer in the
[30:08] church and god has blessed this church
[30:10] to have brother alden
[30:11] and we can never thank him or his family
[30:14] enough
[30:15] they to my my opinion
[30:19] the fraser family has a legacy because
[30:22] men have stepped up to the plate and so
[30:24] god bless you brother alden and sister
[30:26] tracy we
[30:27] we see their legacy standing before us
[30:29] today singing and praying and
[30:31] we see god's blessings on their lives so
[30:35] at this time we know that uh many of you
[30:38] know
[30:38] the governor has of virginia has made
[30:41] his statement
[30:42] that he is planning a phase one of
[30:44] reopening
[30:45] on may the 15th and so i know that many
[30:48] of you have questions and so
[30:50] i have written along with brother ron i
[30:53] have written a letter
[30:55] and put these things together and we
[30:57] will be putting this letter on the
[30:58] church website
[30:59] and sending it out to you via the church
[31:03] text messaging
[31:04] route and so we just want to present
[31:06] these things to you
[31:08] we know that he is opening it next
[31:11] weekend or
[31:12] next friday but we feel to err on the
[31:15] side of caution and we want to
[31:18] be very diligent in these things we have
[31:20] prayed and put much consideration in
[31:22] these things
[31:24] and so we don't want to come back next
[31:26] weekend but tentatively we want to come
[31:27] back the weekend following that uh the
[31:29] date will be may the 23rd and may the
[31:31] 24th
[31:32] but i'm going to read you this letter
[31:34] because i know that many times in
[31:35] reading sometimes you miss things so i
[31:37] want to read it audibly to you
[31:40] and then we will present it to you again
[31:42] next weekend
[31:43] so lord willing tentatively we will have
[31:46] uh
[31:46] this this service and next service will
[31:49] be our last services
[31:51] alone here with the the few chosen and
[31:54] uh
[31:54] so we just read you this letter to you
[31:56] this morning uh dear full gospel
[31:58] lighthouse
[31:59] tabernacle church family we have
[32:02] certainly missed being able to assemble
[32:03] ourselves together according
[32:05] as the bible has taught us to do so in
[32:08] hebrews 10 and 25
[32:10] not forsaking the assembling of
[32:12] ourselves together as the manner
[32:14] of some is but exhorting one another and
[32:17] so much the more
[32:18] as you see the day approaching although
[32:21] we have been
[32:21] grateful for the opportunity to greet
[32:23] you and bring forth the preaching of the
[32:25] word via live stream truly it has been a
[32:28] blessing of the lord for many locally
[32:31] and around the world
[32:32] even those who are not believers have
[32:34] been tuning in
[32:36] as of now the government is introducing
[32:38] a phase one of reopening the state and
[32:40] easing the restrictions
[32:42] on gatherings and asking for 50 capacity
[32:46] of gatherings at churches
[32:48] again we do not believe that this is a
[32:50] religious persecution that necessitates
[32:53] a need to defy our government's request
[32:56] as they try to contain this virus we
[32:59] want to do our part and make sure that
[33:01] we don't increase the spread of this
[33:02] virus in our congregation
[33:05] nor hurt our assembly in any way
[33:07] health-wise
[33:08] nor affect anybody's in employment
[33:12] brother ron and myself have came up with
[33:15] these guidelines for us to try and
[33:18] resume
[33:19] services in a safe manner these
[33:21] guidelines may seem difficult and
[33:23] different
[33:24] but we are looking for a safe way for us
[33:27] to attend services
[33:28] in person we are trusting this is only
[33:31] for a couple weeks until we can once
[33:33] again resume a sense of normalcy
[33:36] in our services the following are
[33:38] recommendations and guidelines that we
[33:40] would like to ask for your teamwork
[33:43] in trying to abide with social
[33:45] distancing
[33:46] and at the same time give us a
[33:48] opportunity to attend
[33:50] at least one service a week in person
[33:54] first of all we would like to ask you
[33:56] not to come to church if you or anyone
[33:59] in your family are sick
[34:01] or having symptoms of coughing running
[34:03] nose
[34:05] fever or sore throat we ask during this
[34:08] time that there be no shaking of hands
[34:10] nor hugging anyone during this time
[34:12] as paul has said to us to salute the
[34:15] brethren
[34:16] when you arrive at church we will have
[34:18] the outside
[34:20] and sanctuary doors propped open so no
[34:22] one has to open or close them
[34:25] the deacons or ushers will seat you in
[34:27] the sanctuary in order to mainta
[34:29] maintain social distancing six feet
[34:32] apart
[34:33] you will be you will be seated with your
[34:35] entire family
[34:37] you may not be able to sit in your
[34:38] normal location
[34:40] in the sanctuary as the ushers will seat
[34:42] you accordingly
[34:44] any of your belongings that you have may
[34:46] have left here during
[34:48] this this uh time that we've not been
[34:50] able to gather any of your belongings
[34:52] that you may have left at church
[34:54] such as blankets bags toys etc your
[34:57] camping gear
[34:59] will be moved to the back near the tape
[35:01] library
[35:02] for you to grab and take with you once
[35:04] leaving the service
[35:06] so we will we will put all of those
[35:08] things at the back for you to grab
[35:10] uh two weeks from now and as you take
[35:13] them because other people will be
[35:14] sitting in the seats that you set in
[35:16] when you came
[35:17] if you can take them with you when you
[35:19] leave
[35:21] would be greatly appreciated the local
[35:23] and state authorities
[35:24] have recommended that we wear face masks
[35:26] or coverings while gathering
[35:28] we would like to ask everyone that has
[35:30] their own face covering
[35:32] to wear it when coming to the services
[35:35] if you do not have a face covering we
[35:36] will provide you with one before
[35:38] entering the church please wear the face
[35:41] mask
[35:42] until you are seated in the sanctuary
[35:44] the decision to leave your face
[35:46] mask or covering on in the sanctuary
[35:48] during services
[35:50] will left be left to up to each
[35:52] individual
[35:53] at your own discretion we will have
[35:56] multiple
[35:57] hand sanitizing stations set up and as
[36:00] always
[36:01] please wash your hands please wash your
[36:03] hands
[36:04] please wash your hands with trying to
[36:07] maintain
[36:07] social distancing due to the size of our
[36:10] congregation we can only
[36:12] accommodate a certain amount of people
[36:13] in the sanctuary therefore
[36:16] we will have half of our congregation
[36:18] attend on saturday night at 7 00 p.m
[36:20] and the other half on sunday morning at
[36:23] 11 a.m
[36:24] attentively we plan to start these
[36:27] in-person services on saturday may the
[36:29] 23rd
[36:30] and sunday may the 24th on saturday
[36:33] nights we'd like those who normally sit
[36:36] on the right-hand side
[36:37] as you enter the sanctuary to attend
[36:39] this is the side that brother vernon
[36:42] frazier and brother joe shifflet on
[36:44] which would be to my left but as
[36:46] your right as you enter the building on
[36:49] sunday mornings those who normally sit
[36:51] on the left hand side as you enter the
[36:53] sanctuary to attend
[36:55] this is the side that brothers shannon
[36:57] shifflett and brother ald and fraser set
[36:59] on
[37:00] this will give us adequate space to
[37:02] place everyone
[37:04] six feet away from our congregants also
[37:07] the musicians
[37:08] sound technicians and their families can
[37:10] attend both services
[37:12] if they feel comfortable enough to do so
[37:15] it would be greatly appreciated we are
[37:18] asking that there be no congregating in
[37:20] the vestibule bathrooms
[37:22] nurseries front porch or parking lot
[37:24] before or after services
[37:27] after the service is over the deacons
[37:29] ushers will dismiss the congregation by
[37:32] rolls
[37:33] back to front to allow everyone to
[37:35] dismiss to their cars
[37:36] even on the outside of church we asked
[37:39] for there to be
[37:40] no kind of congregating we again
[37:43] we ask that there be no shaking the
[37:45] hands nor hugging anyone during this
[37:47] time
[37:48] as paul said to salute the brethren we
[37:51] will receive the tithes and offerings by
[37:53] letting each row come forward one at a
[37:55] time
[37:56] and placing them in the offering plates
[37:58] at the altar
[38:00] we will not be having saturday kids
[38:02] choir nor adult or young adult choir
[38:05] until further notice and although we are
[38:08] opening our church services in this
[38:09] manner
[38:10] if for any reason you do not feel safe
[38:13] or comfortable to return at this time we
[38:15] totally understand
[38:16] the decision will be left up to you and
[38:19] as an individual
[38:20] and at your own discretion the services
[38:23] will continue to be streamed
[38:25] via the church website and youtube
[38:27] channel
[38:28] finally we want to encourage you all to
[38:30] remember
[38:31] our brothers and sisters in christ
[38:33] during this season
[38:34] what a great time for us as the bride of
[38:37] jesus to bind our hearts
[38:39] together in christian love and faith and
[38:41] lift up the needs that we are facing
[38:44] as a church and a nation and the
[38:46] conclusion of the matter is that god is
[38:49] with
[38:49] us and we are seeing miracles god bless
[38:52] you brother ron
[38:53] and brother andrew the grace of our lord
[38:56] jesus
[38:56] be with you all amen so thank you for
[38:59] bearing with me we just wanted to bring
[39:01] those things to your attention
[39:03] this weekend again no service next
[39:05] weekend but the weekend following
[39:07] attentively we are planning to have
[39:09] services on may the 23rd
[39:12] and may the 24th saturday night seven
[39:14] o'clock
[39:15] and sunday morning at 11 o'clock amen
[39:18] god bless you this morning
[39:20] let's let's sing this maybe we could
[39:22] sing that song the manger
[39:24] manger of my heart as we get ready to go
[39:27] to the word this morning
[39:29] we just want to prepare our hearts for
[39:32] the the speaking of the word and
[39:34] just want to continue this thought that
[39:36] we've spoken to you on before on
[39:38] committed
[39:40] we just want to our hearts to to be his
[39:44] and not our own nor anyone else we want
[39:47] our hearts to be his
[39:50] it was a tiny simple stable
[39:54] all beaten and worn
[39:59] hardly a place
[40:04] for a king to be born
[40:08] he didn't choose some place special
[40:13] to reveal his majesty
[40:18] so i know if i'll give him control he'll
[40:24] be
[40:24] born in me let your
[40:29] word be born
[40:33] in the manger of my heart
[40:40] [Music]
[40:50] of clay
[40:56] [Music]
[41:10] [Music]
[41:14] i'm nothing not much to behold
[41:23] unlikely the place
[41:27] for his word to unfold
[41:32] but if i'll just shield this very soul
[41:37] and let him have his way
[41:42] from glory unto glory
[41:47] he'll change me day by day
[41:51] let your word
[41:54] be born in the manger
[41:59] of my heart
[42:06] [Music]
[42:12] live inside this house
[42:17] [Music]
[42:37] amen if you have your bibles this
[42:38] morning we want to turn over
[42:41] into the book of isaiah chapter 14 and
[42:44] verse 24.
[42:47] isaiah chapter 14 and verse 24.

[43:42] way to be able to express it father
[43:45] lord i could tell you i love you all day
[43:47] long and i still don't feel like that
[43:49] would be enough
[43:51] but lord again i want to tell you how
[43:53] much i love you
[43:54] you mean so much to me whether at the
[43:58] end of this road of life

[44:03] and enter in father i would still serve

[44:36] father to be able to speak to your
[44:37] children lord one more time
[44:40] lord jesus we we so appreciate this
[44:44] opportunity to greet him in the name of
[44:46] the lord
[44:47] but we pray that today that not only in
[44:50] this
[44:50] tabernacle but in the tabernacle of
[44:52] their flesh and in their home
[44:54] may they sense the nearness of the holy
[44:56] spirit and may you speak to them lit to
[44:59] ear

[45:03] has caused a lot of indifference in our
[45:05] life

[45:20] of them bless our pastor
[45:22] lord bless bless him anoint him
[45:25] abundantly let your healing virtue flow
[45:28] through his body
[45:30] bringing a complete restoration to him
[45:34] now father we ask god do you have your
[45:36] way in this service
[45:37] we love and appreciate you today in the
[45:40] name of the lord jesus christ
[45:42] and the church and the bride says amen
[45:44] here and at home
[45:46] isaiah chapter 14 and verse 24. now the
[45:49] bible says here
[45:51] the lord of hosts hath sworn saying
[45:53] surely as i have thought so shall it
[45:56] come to pass
[45:57] and as i have purposed so shall i stand
[46:01] that i will break the assyrian in my
[46:04] land and upon
[46:05] my mountains tread him under foot then
[46:08] shall his yoke depart from off them
[46:11] and is burdened apart from off their
[46:13] shoulders
[46:15] notice this is the purpose that is
[46:16] purposed upon the whole earth and this
[46:19] is the hand that is stretched out
[46:21] upon all the nations for the lord of
[46:24] hosts hath
[46:25] purposed and who shall disannoy it
[46:28] who shall who shall turn it away who
[46:31] shall reject it
[46:32] and his hand is stretched out and who
[46:34] shall turn it back
[46:36] may god bless the reading of the word
[46:37] you may be seated this morning
[46:39] committed to the purpose
[46:42] no matter how little you are or nor how
[46:45] big you are how important you are
[46:47] or how unimportant you are you are here
[46:50] to serve a purpose
[46:51] just as my finger is here for a purpose
[46:54] my nail finger my nail on my finger is
[46:56] for a purpose
[46:57] my eye and every part of our body is to
[47:00] serve a purpose
[47:01] and it was not put here just to see what
[47:04] it would look like when it was put here
[47:06] but it was put here
[47:07] to serve its purpose it was god's divine
[47:10] plan to do so
[47:12] and if we were put here for a purpose
[47:15] then there is nothing that can destroy
[47:18] us
[47:18] until god's purpose is fulfilled nothing
[47:22] can harm us until that purpose
[47:24] that god has put us here for has been
[47:28] made
[47:28] manifest no matter how much trouble we
[47:31] have
[47:31] how much heartaches or sorrows that we
[47:34] go through
[47:35] all of these are reasons and there's a
[47:37] reason for
[47:38] it we realize that god has placed us in
[47:41] this age of laodicea
[47:43] not to be not to be survivors but to be
[47:46] overcomers to be
[47:48] a people that overcome the enemy that we
[47:51] face in this hour
[47:53] overcoming laodicea in its slothfulness
[47:56] and it's in its lack of repentance
[47:59] overcoming laodicea in all of its ways
[48:02] and here god is committed to his word
[48:05] there's one thing that god cannot do
[48:08] i've learned all the way from a little
[48:09] bitty child
[48:10] knowing these things that god cannot lie
[48:13] and if god has a purpose in a person's
[48:15] life that god will
[48:17] god will bring and fulfill that purpose
[48:19] in that person's life and
[48:21] here today no matter how important you
[48:24] are know how
[48:24] matter how unimportant you are you are
[48:27] here for his purpose and
[48:28] many times we think in life that our
[48:31] part has
[48:32] is maybe a little too little too little
[48:34] to be noticed but
[48:36] each of us have a specific role in
[48:39] christianity maybe it's just to witness
[48:41] to one or
[48:42] or to just live a life and maybe it's
[48:44] for sisters
[48:46] just to just to to to dress holy
[48:49] and for somebody to give their life of
[48:51] christ to christ
[48:52] because of watching the testimony of an
[48:55] individual
[48:56] and we realize that no matter what we go
[48:58] through no matter what satan tries to
[49:00] pin on us that god's purpose will be
[49:03] performed in all things
[49:07] and we realize that god's purpose can
[49:09] never be defeated
[49:10] there is nothing that can defeat it so
[49:12] happy aren't we to be today resting upon
[49:15] that beautiful revelation of the word
[49:18] of the living god that there is nothing
[49:20] present
[49:21] nor things that can come there's no
[49:24] sickness
[49:24] nor sorrow nor death no perils nor such
[49:27] nor nothing can separate us from the
[49:30] purpose of the living god you see what
[49:33] god has imagined in his mind what god
[49:35] has purposed in his heart
[49:37] to bring to pass there is no demon there
[49:39] is no power there is nothing
[49:42] can separate us you see nothing can
[49:45] separate god's great eternal plan it
[49:48] must be
[49:49] as god has said no matter what comes no
[49:51] matter what the enemy throws at us
[49:53] we know god's eternal plan nothing can
[49:56] separate us from that
[49:58] he can throw cancer at us and it won't
[50:00] separate us from god's plan
[50:02] it may tear us up in the humanistic
[50:04] point it may tear us up
[50:06] in our own ways it may tear our body
[50:08] down it may tear our maybe
[50:10] our belief structure in a sense but it
[50:12] will not tear
[50:13] god's purpose down whatsoever
[50:17] and we realize that in all things that
[50:19] god gets the glory
[50:21] a lot of times people think that just
[50:23] because they come out on the other side
[50:24] of a battle or
[50:26] they go through something that that
[50:27] their name is higher
[50:29] absolutely not in this kingdom of god if
[50:31] we go through something that is for
[50:33] god's glory
[50:34] it is not for us as individuals to feel
[50:37] like we're something
[50:38] that we came through with this or we
[50:40] went through that it is for god's
[50:42] purpose
[50:43] and for god's glory and we realize it
[50:46] teaches us that god can use
[50:48] every faculty of our being if we are
[50:51] surrendered to him
[50:52] he can use our mind our dreams our
[50:54] subconscious our first conscious
[50:57] our tongue our songs our eyes and
[50:59] everything that we can
[51:01] that we have can be used of god if it's
[51:03] committed to god i want to commit my
[51:05] ways to him this morning
[51:07] everything that you are just committed
[51:09] to god he'll use
[51:11] every outlet and every part of you he'll
[51:13] use it no matter what it is he'll use it
[51:16] if it's sanctified to his purpose and
[51:19] calling
[51:19] and we look out and we think about the
[51:21] mothers that are of this church and we
[51:23] think about my mom and i think about my
[51:26] grandma and i think about the ladies in
[51:28] my life
[51:28] my mother-in-law my own wife and i and i
[51:31] see the display
[51:32] i don't just see the display of himself
[51:35] but i watch the expression of god
[51:37] realizing that god has placed on the
[51:40] inside of that mother
[51:41] he has placed on the inside of that
[51:43] mother godly characteristics
[51:45] to be a real mom to be a rugged
[51:47] christian he didn't call us to run
[51:49] around
[51:50] and to drink and do all of these things
[51:51] and run around on our children and
[51:53] place ipads in front of them but to be
[51:55] real god fearing women
[51:57] that testify the things of god and we
[52:00] look at the commitment
[52:01] of the mother and we think about we
[52:03] think about how they're so committed to
[52:05] stay there day in and day out before the
[52:07] lord and
[52:08] asking his will and wanting his will and
[52:11] we think about that little possum
[52:13] how that she was so committed to go to a
[52:15] far to a
[52:16] to a prophet's house and here they would
[52:19] bypass it and the prophet would bypass
[52:21] it
[52:21] but yet that mother's love for her
[52:23] babies
[52:24] you see she was pregnant and now she had
[52:27] those little babies
[52:28] and because of because of her because of
[52:31] her commitment as a mother
[52:33] to bring forth and to give her life for
[52:36] them
[52:36] she was committed to bring forth life
[52:38] and to lay at a prophet's doorstep
[52:40] now today she could come and lay at my
[52:42] doorstep but i wouldn't know what it is
[52:44] but she came to the right door and she
[52:47] was committed and you think about the
[52:49] deer as
[52:50] as as a as a mother of a deer would step
[52:52] out as a in a heroic space
[52:54] she would step out to guard her children
[52:57] and we think about the
[52:58] the lady our minds are reminded about
[53:00] the lady that was on that train that
[53:02] time and
[53:03] remember as she's coming back on that
[53:05] train she's coming back from college and
[53:07] she's
[53:07] she's going back through there and and
[53:09] her friends are around her and they're
[53:11] making fun of this lady that was all
[53:13] scarred up that
[53:14] that had oh a horrible looking face but
[53:17] yet
[53:17] the the conductor knew the story behind
[53:20] it
[53:21] you see it was the mother's love that
[53:23] allowed her
[53:24] to step out in a fire and run up into a
[53:28] burning building
[53:29] and save her child you see she was
[53:32] committed
[53:33] to bring the purpose of a motherhood
[53:36] to pass she couldn't be a mother without
[53:38] that child
[53:39] and i think about the commitment of god
[53:41] today
[53:42] that god is not leaving us in laotis
[53:45] here just here alone
[53:46] that god is committed to his promise
[53:48] he's committed to his children
[53:51] you see he's not obligated to this flesh
[53:53] but he is obligated to his word and what
[53:56] god had in his mind before the
[53:57] foundation of the world
[53:59] will come to pass this flesh may let you
[54:02] down
[54:03] this flesh your teeth may fall out may
[54:04] have to get false teeth you may have to
[54:06] get glasses and
[54:07] may have to put hair plugs in your hair
[54:09] and all types of different things
[54:11] this flesh will disappoint you but god
[54:13] will never disappoint you
[54:16] hallelujah now the bible says here in
[54:19] colossians chapter 1 and 12
[54:22] he says giving thanks unto the father
[54:24] which hath made us meek to be partakers
[54:27] of the inheritance of the saints in
[54:29] light who hath delivered us
[54:31] from the power of darkness and hath
[54:33] translated us
[54:35] into the kingdom of his dear son now
[54:37] notice who hath
[54:38] god who hath delivered us us his
[54:41] children
[54:42] us his people from the power of darkness
[54:46] and hath translated us now that greek
[54:49] word
[54:49] for translating it is methyl satiemy
[54:53] and it means to remove from one place
[54:56] to another or to change of a situation
[54:59] or place or remove from an office of a
[55:02] steward
[55:03] or to to depart from life or to die
[55:06] and we see here that he hath removed us
[55:10] from darkness and translated us
[55:13] into the kingdom of his dear son he hath
[55:16] removed us
[55:17] from the way of satan he has removed us
[55:20] from darkness
[55:21] and placed us as the children of light
[55:24] in verse 14 he says in whom we have
[55:27] redemption through his blood
[55:30] even the forgiveness of sins who is the
[55:33] image of the invisible god the firstborn
[55:35] of every creature
[55:37] for by him were all things created for
[55:40] by him hallelujah
[55:44] we're all things created that are in
[55:46] heaven
[55:47] and that are in earth visible and
[55:49] invisible
[55:50] whether they be thrones or dominions or
[55:52] principalities
[55:54] or powers all things were created
[55:58] by him and for him all things were
[56:02] created by him
[56:03] and for him there is not a tree that is
[56:06] here
[56:06] that was not created by him nor for him
[56:10] it is here to serve out its purpose if a
[56:13] tree was created for a purpose
[56:15] and a flower was created for a purpose
[56:17] how about sons and daughters of god that
[56:20] were placed
[56:21] in the midst of the flaming fire of
[56:23] laodicea
[56:24] that how much more that he would have a
[56:26] children that would be called by his
[56:28] namesake
[56:29] that would be brought out of it all
[56:31] things were created by him
[56:34] and for him and he is before all things
[56:37] and by him all things consist
[56:40] i know that this is hard for some
[56:42] agnostics and atheists to understand
[56:44] but he is before you he is behind you
[56:49] he created you and by him all things
[56:52] hold
[56:53] together and he is the head of the body
[56:57] the church
[56:58] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[57:00] the dead
[57:01] that in all things he might have the
[57:04] preeminence
[57:05] for it please the father that in him
[57:07] should all
[57:08] fullness dwell and having made
[57:12] peace through the blood of his cross by
[57:15] him to reconcile all things unto himself
[57:18] by him i say
[57:19] whether they be things in earth or
[57:22] things in heaven
[57:23] all things were created by him i'm so
[57:26] thankful
[57:27] there's a lot of people that look upon
[57:29] the cross and they think that it's a god
[57:32] an ungodly symbol that people hang in
[57:34] their steering wheel or
[57:35] or they hang people hang there or people
[57:37] hanging around their neck and different
[57:39] things
[57:40] but people do not realize what that's
[57:43] that cross
[57:43] symbolizes is that on that cross it
[57:47] symbolizes
[57:48] that the judgment was taken for all of
[57:51] humanity
[57:52] and through all the pain jesus was
[57:55] committed
[57:56] through all the agony jesus was
[57:58] committed people look on the cross
[58:00] and they turn their head from the cross
[58:02] but they don't realize what that cross
[58:05] means to me
[58:06] it does not realize what that cross
[58:08] means to you for
[58:09] on that old rugged cross
[58:12] is where my lord and savior took
[58:15] upon himself my sin
[58:18] your sin and it symbolizes
[58:22] that sin was judged once and for all
[58:26] whoo hallelujah jesus christ
[58:30] is the head of the body he was god
[58:34] he is god and he will forever remain god
[58:37] over the messiah kingdom and here he is
[58:40] expressing himself
[58:42] in this hour in this moment in this day
[58:45] he is expressing himself
[58:47] we look back to the very beginning and
[58:49] think about god
[58:50] we can't understand god but here the
[58:53] invisible god
[58:55] created all things but we look back if
[58:58] you could open up your imagination as it
[59:00] were
[59:01] and look back and you could see you
[59:04] could see god and out of god with the
[59:06] logos the son
[59:07] and you think about that god in the
[59:10] great beginning before he ever spoke in
[59:12] adam before he ever spoke a molecule
[59:16] or things into existence god
[59:19] had attributes in him and you are his
[59:22] display
[59:23] of his attributes in god
[59:26] was to be a healer but for him to be a
[59:30] healer
[59:31] somebody had to get sick in god there
[59:34] was attributes to be a savior
[59:36] but for him to be a savior somebody had
[59:40] to be lost
[59:41] and in him was the attributes
[59:45] to be a father and in christ the mystery
[59:47] of god revealed the prophet said
[59:49] that he loved fatherhood
[59:52] and before he could be before he could
[59:55] be a father
[59:56] he had to express himself as the son of
[59:59] man
[1:00:00] and for him to display himself he had to
[1:00:03] create himself a body
[1:00:05] so he could become a father a father
[1:00:09] over him
[1:00:11] to think about that all of these things
[1:00:13] were in god's mind
[1:00:15] now to think about there are things that
[1:00:17] go on in your own individual lives
[1:00:20] but to think about that if you are in
[1:00:22] god's mind then
[1:00:24] you are in god's mind now
[1:00:27] because god is not a god like you and i
[1:00:30] that is finite that changes
[1:00:32] with the wind of direction but god is
[1:00:35] infinite
[1:00:35] he's infallible he's the all-powerful
[1:00:38] one
[1:00:38] and if he had you and your offspring in
[1:00:41] his mind
[1:00:43] hallelujah you will always be in his
[1:00:46] mind
[1:00:48] and all of these attributes were wound
[1:00:50] up in one person
[1:00:52] and that person was jesus christ all of
[1:00:55] these things were displayed and
[1:00:57] manifested
[1:00:58] and made clear before us as his children
[1:01:00] it's
[1:01:01] easy for us to look back and to see god
[1:01:04] in jesus
[1:01:04] it's easy for us to look back and see
[1:01:07] god in the apostles and
[1:01:08] seek god and the prophets but for those
[1:01:11] that were standing there
[1:01:13] the pharisees they did not see god
[1:01:16] manifested
[1:01:17] but they seen a false prophet manifested
[1:01:20] in front of them
[1:01:21] they didn't realize what they were
[1:01:23] missing what was happening in front of
[1:01:26] them
[1:01:26] and what was being displayed what was
[1:01:29] poured out
[1:01:30] that god almighty had poured himself
[1:01:33] into a body they were missing what was
[1:01:38] taking place
[1:01:39] in front of them they thought you know
[1:01:42] the first year of his ministry
[1:01:44] everyone was excited with him in the
[1:01:47] second year of his ministry
[1:01:49] things began to get heated with the
[1:01:50] pharisees and the sadducees
[1:01:52] and they were watching the display of
[1:01:55] god that no other man could do these
[1:01:57] things
[1:01:58] except god be with him but they realized
[1:02:02] they realized that this was a threat
[1:02:05] to their sadducee kingdom and i'd say
[1:02:08] that if you are a part of a sadducee
[1:02:10] kingdom
[1:02:11] it will make you sad if you do not see
[1:02:14] the kingdom of the messiah and here they
[1:02:17] were missing
[1:02:19] this great i am in front of them they
[1:02:22] turned them down flatly and cold
[1:02:24] but they didn't realize that god was
[1:02:26] manifested on earth
[1:02:28] for three years to display
[1:02:32] god on earth what was god doing
[1:02:35] is god was getting himself and preparing
[1:02:38] himself a body
[1:02:40] you see this god that we're serving he's
[1:02:43] not a god that just began yesterday
[1:02:46] over your problems that showed up today
[1:02:49] but the god that you are serving
[1:02:51] is the god who can and he's the god who
[1:02:54] will
[1:02:55] is that the god that you serve this
[1:02:56] morning the god that i serve
[1:02:59] he can heal the sick and he will heal
[1:03:02] the sick
[1:03:02] the god that i serve this morning can
[1:03:05] raise the dead
[1:03:06] and he will raise the dead the god that
[1:03:08] i serve this morning can cleanse the
[1:03:10] rapper
[1:03:11] cleanse the leper and he has cleansed
[1:03:13] the leper he clan he can cleanse the
[1:03:16] center
[1:03:16] and he will cleanse the center he can
[1:03:19] save the lost
[1:03:20] and he will save the lost he can bring
[1:03:23] our families in
[1:03:24] he can bring our prodigals in he can
[1:03:27] bring our troubled families in
[1:03:29] and he will bring them in
[1:03:32] he's a god that can perform miracles and
[1:03:35] he's a god that will perform miracles
[1:03:38] but he is right here
[1:03:45] he is right here so don't push him away
[1:03:49] don't push him away out of your
[1:03:50] existence don't push him way back
[1:03:52] somewhere
[1:03:53] in some far off distant land don't push
[1:03:55] him away
[1:03:56] that he's up somewhere past saturn and
[1:03:59] mars and
[1:04:00] all the other jupiter and all those
[1:04:01] things don't push him out there
[1:04:03] he's right here he's right here
[1:04:06] god had a purpose in displaying himself
[1:04:11] you see we can gladly and we can look
[1:04:13] upon the things of god and we see
[1:04:15] god expressing himself but we also see
[1:04:18] satan expressing himself in this hour
[1:04:21] we see him expressing himself in danger
[1:04:24] and
[1:04:25] in sickness and in germs and all types
[1:04:27] of things
[1:04:28] and you want to watch your own life and
[1:04:31] watch which one you
[1:04:33] are displaying whether you are
[1:04:35] expressing christ
[1:04:37] or expressing satan you see the one that
[1:04:40] you're influenced by
[1:04:42] is the one that you will portray
[1:04:45] if you are feeding it's simple as this
[1:04:48] if you are feeding
[1:04:50] on the mind of a man you will produce
[1:04:52] the mind of a man
[1:04:54] but if you are feeding on the unfailing
[1:04:58] body word of the son of man
[1:05:00] you will produce an unfailing word
[1:05:05] hallelujah you see the source of all
[1:05:08] truth is standing by his word
[1:05:10] and he is committed to bring it to pass
[1:05:15] and we want our motive to be his motive
[1:05:19] we want his mind to be our mind we want
[1:05:21] his thoughts to be our thoughts
[1:05:23] we want his word to be our word we want
[1:05:26] his expression
[1:05:27] to be our expression
[1:05:31] we want his thinking we don't want our
[1:05:33] thinking our thinking got us in trouble
[1:05:35] our thinking put us in a
[1:05:37] in the end of a bottle our thinking got
[1:05:39] us in some real messes
[1:05:41] but his thinking hallelujah
[1:05:45] his thinking came and brought me up
[1:05:48] out of the my reclaimed that's the mind
[1:05:51] that we want to have not the mind of
[1:05:53] andrew spencer
[1:05:54] not the mind of ron spencer but the mind
[1:05:57] of almighty god
[1:05:59] you know the mind is a very powerful
[1:06:01] thing
[1:06:02] and science tells us there was research
[1:06:05] done in 2012
[1:06:07] that tells us that we as humans only
[1:06:11] access 10 of our brain
[1:06:16] it's a staggering thought now whether
[1:06:18] whether they know what they're talking
[1:06:19] about or not that's up to them they'll
[1:06:20] make up their mind tomorrow
[1:06:22] but they say that we as humans only
[1:06:24] access
[1:06:25] 10 of our brain that the rest of the 90
[1:06:30] is their staggering or it's or it's
[1:06:32] unused or it's unactivated
[1:06:35] but we if we think about the things
[1:06:38] that we get accomplished with our 10
[1:06:41] what if we would put our 100 of our
[1:06:43] brain if we could actually
[1:06:45] have the capacity to be able to access
[1:06:49] all of the mental faculties that are
[1:06:51] placed in us
[1:06:52] if we had the capacity to express what
[1:06:55] was really in our mind
[1:06:57] now there has been great men like albert
[1:06:59] einstein that had the capacity
[1:07:02] to that go way far beyond beyond my
[1:07:04] hillbilly thinking
[1:07:05] that can go out i could break atoms and
[1:07:07] different things and
[1:07:08] tap into god's laboratory what were they
[1:07:11] doing they were expressing
[1:07:13] a capacity of the brain that
[1:07:16] maybe you and i as just ordinary
[1:07:18] individuals
[1:07:19] we can't we can't understand that
[1:07:21] capacity
[1:07:22] or we can't access that capacity but
[1:07:25] there is a mind
[1:07:26] hallelujah there is a mind that we have
[1:07:29] the capacity
[1:07:30] to be able to express the godhead
[1:07:33] hallelujah
[1:07:34] bodily is filled in jesus but now he is
[1:07:37] no longer there in heaven but he
[1:07:39] is in earth hallelujah
[1:07:42] to think about that if you if you could
[1:07:45] access the full word of god
[1:07:47] the full thought of god and what is this
[1:07:50] that has been displayed to you and on
[1:07:52] this hour
[1:07:54] the mind of christ
[1:08:00] whoo i don't fully grasp everything here
[1:08:04] i don't as a human i don't understand i
[1:08:07] don't understand everything that has
[1:08:08] been
[1:08:09] being brought out i be an idiot to say
[1:08:11] that i understand it all
[1:08:13] and anybody does tell you they
[1:08:14] understand all the mysteries and all the
[1:08:16] events and everything
[1:08:17] they're lying to you they don't only god
[1:08:20] understands the capacity
[1:08:22] but there is a capacity in which he put
[1:08:25] on the inside of you
[1:08:26] to be able to display none other than
[1:08:28] himself
[1:08:30] he has not asked you he did not ask
[1:08:34] you hallelujah he did not ask you to do
[1:08:38] what you did not have the capacity to do
[1:08:42] if god asked you to display himself he
[1:08:44] was known that you have got the
[1:08:46] capability
[1:08:47] to bring that capacity manifest
[1:08:52] who he's not promised you a baptism of
[1:08:55] the holy ghost
[1:08:56] without you being able to access it he's
[1:08:59] not
[1:08:59] promised you healing without you being
[1:09:02] able to access it
[1:09:03] he's not promised you deliverance
[1:09:05] without being able to access it
[1:09:07] there is a capacity on the inside
[1:09:10] of the bride of jesus christ that has
[1:09:13] access
[1:09:13] to the mind of god
[1:09:18] that'll shut hell up he has not asked us
[1:09:21] to do what we did not have the capacity
[1:09:24] to do
[1:09:26] hallelujah there are some that are
[1:09:27] amongst us that can see visions and have
[1:09:30] dreams and
[1:09:30] and be very spiritual and understand
[1:09:34] the things of god for those individuals
[1:09:37] he has allowed them a capacity to bring
[1:09:40] forth and manifest him
[1:09:42] now you may be only able to say amen you
[1:09:44] may be only able to sing
[1:09:46] you may be only able to clap your hands
[1:09:48] off beat
[1:09:49] but god has not asked you to do
[1:09:52] what you did not have the capacity to do
[1:09:55] you see
[1:09:56] if he asks you to do something he knows
[1:09:59] good and well that you're capable to do
[1:10:02] it
[1:10:03] it's just like a lot of people sit down
[1:10:05] at a piano and they never
[1:10:08] they never can express the capacity
[1:10:11] of being able to bring forth a piano
[1:10:14] player but you look at sister cassie she
[1:10:17] has the capacity
[1:10:19] because god for ordained her before the
[1:10:22] world
[1:10:22] to be a piano player and you enjoy her
[1:10:25] piano playing
[1:10:26] you enjoy her gift but if i got over
[1:10:29] there you wouldn't necessarily enjoy my
[1:10:31] gift
[1:10:32] i could play chopsticks or something
[1:10:34] else on it but you wouldn't enjoy me
[1:10:36] playing chopsticks to amazing grace
[1:10:38] i don't have the capacity to be able to
[1:10:42] express him in that way you see god and
[1:10:44] music
[1:10:45] you see god in man you see god in nature
[1:10:49] and every tree has been asked to bring
[1:10:52] forth of its own kind
[1:10:54] every tree he did not ask of the corn to
[1:10:57] produce strawberries
[1:10:58] but he asked the strawberries to produce
[1:11:01] strawberries
[1:11:02] he asked corn to produce corn he asked
[1:11:05] the bride
[1:11:06] to produce the bride of jesus christ the
[1:11:09] church
[1:11:09] can't have the capacity to express this
[1:11:12] but the body of jesus christ that has
[1:11:15] the mind of christ
[1:11:16] has the capacity to express himself on
[1:11:19] earth
[1:11:22] hallelujah i'm
[1:11:26] overwhelmed by these things to think
[1:11:28] about the threefold purpose of god
[1:11:32] i have spent much time if you've
[1:11:34] listened to my ministry
[1:11:36] whatsoever at all you will know that i
[1:11:38] have spent much time
[1:11:40] in god christ is god the mystery of god
[1:11:42] revealed
[1:11:43] i have spent so many hours looking over
[1:11:45] this thing so normally i can't get
[1:11:47] through the first two hours
[1:11:49] it takes four hours to listen to the
[1:11:50] whole thing but i normally can't get to
[1:11:52] the two out first two hours without
[1:11:54] having a jubilee to myself
[1:11:56] but i have spent much time in there
[1:11:58] because i believe
[1:12:00] that that was a an expression that that
[1:12:03] is a capacity
[1:12:05] that the blood of jesus christ has the
[1:12:08] access to
[1:12:09] that this was god manifested
[1:12:13] in flesh when abraham sat down
[1:12:16] and he ate with melchizedek
[1:12:19] we have watched that same melchizedek
[1:12:23] in action in this day
[1:12:27] it is none other than the son of man and
[1:12:29] we watch the threefold purpose of god
[1:12:32] that god wanted to reveal himself to the
[1:12:34] people
[1:12:35] and secondly he wanted to have the
[1:12:36] preeminence in his body
[1:12:38] of believers and thirdly to restore the
[1:12:41] kingdom
[1:12:42] to its rightly position and in all of
[1:12:45] those
[1:12:46] purposes there are folds there are a
[1:12:49] threefold purpose of god
[1:12:51] and in all of those folds there
[1:12:54] is one main one and that is jesus
[1:12:59] he is here to restore the kingdom
[1:13:03] to its rightful his position and did not
[1:13:06] jesus
[1:13:07] teach us how to pray thy kingdom come
[1:13:10] thy will be done on earth
[1:13:15] on earth i don't believe we actually
[1:13:18] understand the capacity
[1:13:20] of jesus's prayers sometimes
[1:13:23] that he thou will be done
[1:13:28] on earth as it is in heaven
[1:13:32] if you look at god's purpose in heaven
[1:13:37] and god's purpose on earth it's still
[1:13:40] the same
[1:13:43] if we could only learn the power of
[1:13:46] jesus's prayer
[1:13:48] to tie us to his eternal word
[1:13:54] he's not asked you to believe something
[1:13:57] that you cannot believe he has not asked
[1:13:59] you
[1:14:00] to display something that you cannot
[1:14:02] display
[1:14:03] he has not asked you to do oh pray for
[1:14:07] me
[1:14:07] he has not asked you to do something
[1:14:10] that he knew that you weren't capable of
[1:14:12] doing
[1:14:14] you look at the prophets in the old
[1:14:16] testament
[1:14:17] they could only express a certain part
[1:14:20] of god you're seeing god partly you sing
[1:14:23] god in abraham
[1:14:25] partly you sing god in noah partly you
[1:14:28] sing god in moses
[1:14:30] partly you sing god in david but they
[1:14:33] could not express the fullness of god
[1:14:37] because they were not god
[1:14:41] but when jesus was manifested
[1:14:45] in the fullness deity himself when he
[1:14:47] was standing on earth
[1:14:49] god in his fullness to die for the sin
[1:14:51] of people that he might bring to his
[1:14:54] church
[1:14:55] hallelujah his church not the
[1:14:57] denominations
[1:14:58] but his church a sanctified life
[1:15:02] that he might have the preeminence and
[1:15:04] the fullness in his church
[1:15:06] notice to manifest every promise
[1:15:09] in these last days that he promised
[1:15:14] to think today that he is manifesting
[1:15:17] himself
[1:15:18] every promise where is he at he's in you
[1:15:22] some people get so mixed up when they
[1:15:24] get into trouble and they think god's
[1:15:26] done mad at him and
[1:15:27] far off and he's he's gonna push them
[1:15:29] aside but they forget the god
[1:15:31] that is dwelling on the inside of them
[1:15:34] you watch a person that gets in the
[1:15:35] midst of a crisis sometimes
[1:15:37] and they'll go to holding onto things
[1:15:38] that can't help them they'll go to
[1:15:40] holding on to things that they don't
[1:15:41] know
[1:15:42] that they know does not have the
[1:15:44] capacity to be able to take care of them
[1:15:46] but in the midst of a crisis you watch
[1:15:48] somebody that deals with a sickness or
[1:15:50] deals of things they'll handle it in a
[1:15:53] certain way and they forget
[1:15:55] what they had the capacity to do
[1:16:01] i i have to say that as an individual as
[1:16:04] a humanistic
[1:16:05] in a humanistic standpoint there are
[1:16:08] things and there are trials that you
[1:16:09] will face
[1:16:10] that there are times when the enemy will
[1:16:12] war with your mind
[1:16:14] tell you that you're not good enough
[1:16:16] tell you that you must have been a
[1:16:18] secret sinner
[1:16:19] that you that you could not have got
[1:16:21] this got this bad thing that has
[1:16:23] happened to you
[1:16:24] unless you had done something wrong
[1:16:27] but you see in a moment you'll allow
[1:16:30] those whispers of the enemy
[1:16:32] you allow those whispers of the enemy to
[1:16:35] override the whispers
[1:16:36] of the bridegroom and here he is in this
[1:16:39] day whispering secrets
[1:16:41] to his wife but yet the enemies on the
[1:16:44] other side
[1:16:45] whispering lies in her ear trying to
[1:16:48] make her have a spiritual amnesia
[1:16:50] to make her forget who she is and what
[1:16:53] she is here to do
[1:16:57] but when he met jesus
[1:17:01] jesus knew who he was jesus was brought
[1:17:04] here for a purpose
[1:17:05] jesus was manifested for a purpose and
[1:17:08] jesus was committed to bringing that
[1:17:11] purpose
[1:17:12] to pass
[1:17:16] now notice if the brothers and sisters
[1:17:19] could share this
[1:17:20] with you today this quote and christ the
[1:17:23] mystery of god revealed
[1:17:25] in paragraph 374 the prophet said what
[1:17:28] was jesus manifested
[1:17:30] for to show god
[1:17:34] we could close the door right now and we
[1:17:37] could leave and say we have had absolute
[1:17:39] church
[1:17:41] what was jesus manifested for
[1:17:44] to show god
[1:17:47] he was god he had to be no man could die
[1:17:51] no prophet could die
[1:17:52] he was god he was the god of the
[1:17:54] prophets he was the prophets he was the
[1:17:56] kings
[1:17:56] he was the history he was he that was to
[1:17:59] come
[1:18:00] he that was and he that is and he that's
[1:18:03] to be in that day
[1:18:04] in this day the same yesterday today
[1:18:07] and forever he was manifested
[1:18:11] for that purpose
[1:18:15] made clear made known to bring into view
[1:18:18] that we could understand god
[1:18:22] who and for god to understand us
[1:18:27] you see god god in the beginning
[1:18:31] could not understand how you feel
[1:18:33] brother donny when you're going through
[1:18:34] pain as god
[1:18:36] because he could not understand because
[1:18:39] he was god
[1:18:41] but when he poured himself into christ
[1:18:46] and he took on the robe of humanity
[1:18:49] he could feel like brother donnie feels
[1:18:52] he could feel like our brothers and
[1:18:54] sisters feel
[1:18:56] he could understand a headache he could
[1:18:58] understand pain
[1:19:00] he could understand a broken heart he
[1:19:03] was manifested to show god
[1:19:06] to make clear and to bring into view
[1:19:09] that this is me
[1:19:15] verse 8 paragraph 375 and throw that
[1:19:18] purpose
[1:19:19] and through that purpose through that
[1:19:21] purpose
[1:19:22] he achieved a church that he
[1:19:26] the fullness of god he might bring to
[1:19:28] pass every promised word of god
[1:19:30] and in his last days when
[1:19:34] when he gets the preeminence preeminence
[1:19:37] in the church the position
[1:19:39] his place in the church
[1:19:44] let me read it again when he gets the
[1:19:47] preeminences
[1:19:49] preeminence in the church the position
[1:19:54] her place no his place
[1:19:58] in the church jesus said that he that
[1:20:00] believeth on me
[1:20:02] the worst that i do shall he do also
[1:20:04] even more than he's do than these shall
[1:20:07] he do for i go to my father see
[1:20:09] that was his purpose there was a
[1:20:11] manifestation and now today he wants to
[1:20:13] get somebody
[1:20:14] that can so see it that they can let the
[1:20:17] word see
[1:20:18] jesus so seen it so was so perfectly
[1:20:21] born for the day
[1:20:23] until god expressed every move that he
[1:20:25] made
[1:20:26] he was god's revelations god revealed
[1:20:30] now he's sanctified with his spirit of
[1:20:32] body
[1:20:33] excuse me with his spirit and blood a
[1:20:35] church
[1:20:36] that he might make every promise in this
[1:20:39] last day
[1:20:40] be revealed now see he could go back and
[1:20:43] pick up what these other fellows
[1:20:44] has left off here in the last days by
[1:20:47] his holy spirit and reveal all the
[1:20:49] mystery of the seven seals
[1:20:50] see he is expressing himself
[1:20:54] that's his purpose
[1:20:57] he's committed to that purpose that's
[1:21:00] why he died
[1:21:02] that's the second fold of his threefold
[1:21:03] manifestation
[1:21:05] first to express himself in christ then
[1:21:07] to express himself
[1:21:09] through the church and the same thing
[1:21:11] christ was a word
[1:21:13] and the church becomes the word when it
[1:21:16] lets the word go
[1:21:17] through them
[1:21:21] let that sink in the church
[1:21:24] becomes the word when it lets the word
[1:21:26] go through them
[1:21:28] can't you see when you take that word
[1:21:31] that these things shall you do because
[1:21:34] greater is he
[1:21:35] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:21:37] world can't you exceed
[1:21:39] why god is being manifested to express
[1:21:43] himself not for you to get glory not for
[1:21:46] you to be magnified
[1:21:47] but for god to receive glory
[1:21:50] honor and blessings he hath prepared
[1:21:54] himself a body
[1:21:59] who you're talking about me
[1:22:02] i'm talking about you the prophet would
[1:22:05] say
[1:22:06] who is me who is me
[1:22:10] this ain't me this hand ate me this
[1:22:13] flesh ate me
[1:22:15] my imagination ate me but on the inside
[1:22:18] that's the real person that is where you
[1:22:22] watch god work throughout your
[1:22:24] imagination
[1:22:25] your affection and your reasoning and
[1:22:27] then walk through your flesh
[1:22:30] who is you who is really on the inside
[1:22:33] of you
[1:22:34] what's making you dress this way sisters
[1:22:36] what's making you brothers live a holy
[1:22:38] life
[1:22:39] it's god
[1:22:44] some people look on you you sisters you
[1:22:47] dress
[1:22:47] holy you live holy and they think well
[1:22:50] there's some man
[1:22:52] making them do that i have never called
[1:22:54] up one of the sisters of this church
[1:22:56] and told them that they need to come to
[1:22:58] church dressing like this
[1:23:00] i have preached to them but i have never
[1:23:03] called them up
[1:23:04] and told them that if you don't come to
[1:23:05] church dress like this
[1:23:07] i'll cast you out absolutely not
[1:23:10] it's jesus's job to catch you
[1:23:14] and it's jesus's job to reel you in he
[1:23:17] just does the preaching of the word
[1:23:19] but i have never called a brother up and
[1:23:21] told them don't you dare come into
[1:23:23] church wearing a pair of shorts
[1:23:25] there is something on the inside of
[1:23:27] these brothers
[1:23:28] on the inside of these sisters that
[1:23:30] makes them want to dress holy
[1:23:32] holiness don't begin on the outside it
[1:23:35] begins on the inside
[1:23:37] and when holiness is on the inside when
[1:23:39] purity is on the inside
[1:23:41] when when the holy ghost is on the
[1:23:43] inside it'll push its way out
[1:23:45] just like a seed does when you commit it
[1:23:48] to the grounds
[1:23:49] you don't go out there and dig it up you
[1:23:51] bury it you put it in the ground you
[1:23:53] water it
[1:23:54] let the sun rise on it and you watch it
[1:23:56] push out what it was committed to do
[1:24:00] and that's what is being displayed
[1:24:01] before gospel lighthouse and the bride
[1:24:03] of jesus christ
[1:24:05] you are watching christ on the inside of
[1:24:08] the church
[1:24:09] working on the outside
[1:24:13] forgive me i'm a little bit excited
[1:24:16] today
[1:24:17] because if the children of god
[1:24:20] grasp this thought
[1:24:24] there is nothing that can defeat them
[1:24:28] and when you get sick just because you
[1:24:31] get sick does not make you
[1:24:33] an enemy to god just because you go
[1:24:36] through troubles
[1:24:38] does not make you an enemy to god it is
[1:24:41] showing that god has confidence
[1:24:45] in you you see he knew that he could not
[1:24:48] call miss methodist to this because miss
[1:24:51] methodist couldn't dress this way
[1:24:54] but you see there has been a word
[1:24:56] released in this hour
[1:24:58] to make a body make a bride dress right
[1:25:01] you look at miss methodist and you look
[1:25:03] at miss wesley and you look at them and
[1:25:05] they try to raise up their father
[1:25:07] and you look at them and their garments
[1:25:08] are completely spotty
[1:25:10] but you look at this body of jesus
[1:25:12] christ i know sometimes you get caught
[1:25:14] up on
[1:25:15] on what you did and what you came
[1:25:17] through if you're gonna look through the
[1:25:18] eyes of mercy this morning
[1:25:21] he don't see you spotty he sees you pure
[1:25:24] he don't see you ragging he sees you
[1:25:26] clean
[1:25:28] hallelujah hallelujah age don't have
[1:25:32] aids don't have nothing to do with the
[1:25:33] promise of god he's still committed to
[1:25:36] the promise
[1:25:38] how did jesus defeat satan by the word
[1:25:42] so that is the blood of jesus christ
[1:25:46] that is her weapon of choice it's not a
[1:25:49] bone arrow
[1:25:50] it's not a bazooka it's not an ar-15 but
[1:25:55] the weapon of choice for the bride of
[1:25:56] jesus christ
[1:25:57] is the weapon of the word and the weapon
[1:26:00] of this word will defeat satan any time
[1:26:03] any place under any situation undiscern
[1:26:06] any circumstance you put it on
[1:26:08] you can test this word and the test will
[1:26:10] show that the word is true
[1:26:13] you see the bride of jesus christ as
[1:26:15] thus saith the lord
[1:26:16] or she said still she's not moving
[1:26:19] without her head
[1:26:22] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:26:25] you watch you watch as a father and a
[1:26:28] son
[1:26:30] you watch them as they walk you watch
[1:26:33] their life and you can see there are
[1:26:35] certain characteristics between
[1:26:37] brother steve i oppressed his brother
[1:26:40] steve you can watch the manifestation
[1:26:41] and you watch the influence and he
[1:26:43] watched his characteristics
[1:26:44] and he stood up here and he sang to you
[1:26:46] an uncloudy day
[1:26:48] and then you watch the characteristics
[1:26:50] of brother steve that was passed on
[1:26:52] through the germ through the drum of
[1:26:54] life to his son brother jeffrey
[1:26:56] and you watch as brother jeffrey sings
[1:26:58] and brother jeff reacts
[1:26:59] you'll see brother steve and brother
[1:27:02] jeffrey same as any individual
[1:27:04] here you are carrying characteristics
[1:27:07] of your father and you watch as the
[1:27:10] bride of jesus christ

[1:27:18] and know how to work things well
[1:27:20] key on that part know how to work things
[1:27:21] well you watch them as they know how to
[1:27:24] work things well
[1:27:25] that they work hand in hand together
[1:27:27] they finish each other's sentences
[1:27:29] and they finish each other how they do
[1:27:31] if one is hammering
[1:27:32] the other one will hand them a nail if
[1:27:34] you watch how they act
[1:27:35] you'll see that they have become one
[1:27:39] you see the two are no longer twain but
[1:27:41] they have become one
[1:27:43] and you watch jesus christ two thousand
[1:27:45] years ago
[1:27:46] and you watch the body today and you'll
[1:27:49] see the same life

[1:28:05] up in heaven but deity is in you
[1:28:08] and in that sermon oneness of unity he
[1:28:11] said that your voice
[1:28:12] is his voice and when you speak
[1:28:15] he speaks there is a voice of
[1:28:18] resurrection
[1:28:19] in the body of jesus christ
[1:28:23] you watch as that body goes over and lay
[1:28:25] hands on a dead body you watch that dead
[1:28:27] body

[1:28:44] pass it
[1:28:45] is god's manifestation that he is not

[1:30:21] something on the inside of you

[1:30:39] jesus
[1:30:41] it's sir something on the inside of you
[1:30:44] what is this it is a continuation of the
[1:30:48] book of acts
[1:30:49] it is a continuation of the ministry of
[1:30:52] the son of man
[1:30:53] that you are watching a sharp two-widget
[1:30:56] sword
[1:30:57] as it goes cutting to and fro
[1:31:01] you're watching the discerner of the
[1:31:03] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:31:05] and you realize that's him
[1:31:09] that's him that's a powerful thing to
[1:31:11] recognize him
[1:31:12] it's a very powerful thing to recognize
[1:31:14] him because there's a lot of people
[1:31:16] that's a lot of people that do not
[1:31:18] recognize him because the veil of flesh
[1:31:21] but there is a people that look past the
[1:31:25] flesh and they see god
[1:31:27] there's a lot of friends that listen to
[1:31:29] these services
[1:31:30] and they don't get the same thing out of
[1:31:32] it like you get out of it
[1:31:34] because they see the veil of flesh
[1:31:38] but you realize that there's something
[1:31:42] more going on here with this whole
[1:31:44] battle
[1:31:45] as us as a church full gospel lighthouse
[1:31:47] there's something more going on here
[1:31:50] there's something more don't get your
[1:31:51] eyes on the flesh and don't get
[1:31:52] captivated with what's happening
[1:31:54] with happening with this week or that
[1:31:56] week or this week or that week
[1:31:58] satan gets into details but if you could
[1:32:01] watch what is really happening here
[1:32:03] if you can really watch that jesus is at
[1:32:06] work
[1:32:08] i don't understand i don't understand or
[1:32:10] if we
[1:32:11] understand the the capabilities or the
[1:32:13] capacity
[1:32:15] that god has has brought before us
[1:32:18] you see no matter what we go through
[1:32:21] no matter what we've been through god is
[1:32:24] still committed to us
[1:32:26] you see when abraham was without an heir
[1:32:29] he was still committed to him
[1:32:31] when abraham laid isaac on the altar he
[1:32:33] was still committed to him
[1:32:35] when egypt was locked up in bondage when
[1:32:38] israel was locked up in bondage down in
[1:32:40] egypt god was still committed to him so
[1:32:43] god raised up a deliverer
[1:32:45] and he was still committed to them when
[1:32:47] moses was a runaway slave
[1:32:50] he was still committed to them you see
[1:32:53] your circumstance doesn't change
[1:32:56] the promise and it does not change
[1:33:00] god's commitment a lot of times
[1:33:03] in earthly realms we get consumed
[1:33:07] with everything that everything's going
[1:33:08] on around us that we can't trust you no
[1:33:11] more
[1:33:11] because of what you did we may forgive
[1:33:14] you
[1:33:15] but we'll never forget it but god
[1:33:19] being god be an infinite
[1:33:22] and there is a blood cell there is a
[1:33:24] blood cell that makes you pure
[1:33:27] god not only forgives you but he forgets
[1:33:30] what you said
[1:33:31] he forgets what you've done he forgets
[1:33:33] what you thought
[1:33:34] you see he is the creator of heaven and
[1:33:37] earth and all things were made by him
[1:33:39] and for him he is the creator of the new
[1:33:42] creation of god
[1:33:44] of christ and if any man be in christ he
[1:33:47] is a new creature
[1:33:48] you've seen you'll look back where you
[1:33:50] were
[1:33:52] you looked back at some of your lives
[1:33:54] and some of you were homeless
[1:33:55] some of you were strung out on drugs and
[1:33:58] on alcohol
[1:33:59] but because god is a creator he
[1:34:02] manifested himself
[1:34:03] and brought forth sons to be
[1:34:07] to his glory god's promises are true
[1:34:12] god's promises aren't necessarily easy
[1:34:16] but they're true they're true
[1:34:20] a lot of times we're looking on the back
[1:34:21] end of the bible and looking for a tamp
[1:34:23] or a stamp on the back end of that door
[1:34:25] and that promise and see when it's going
[1:34:27] to come to pass
[1:34:28] there's neither a time stamp on it
[1:34:30] saying when it's going to be fulfilled
[1:34:31] in your life
[1:34:32] but i know that he is the lord our god
[1:34:34] that heals all of our diseases
[1:34:36] that by his tribes we are healed it does
[1:34:39] not say on this date you will be healed
[1:34:41] it does not day on this date that you
[1:34:43] will be saved or it does not say on this
[1:34:45] day your offspring will come in
[1:34:47] but there is a promise and god is
[1:34:50] committed to his promise
[1:34:52] but wonder on the other side of the
[1:34:54] promise can you
[1:34:55] remain committed with faith to stand
[1:34:58] there
[1:34:59] with the faith that was once delivered
[1:35:01] to the saints
[1:35:02] that could stand there they were sown as
[1:35:05] under they were jerked to pieces
[1:35:06] they were put in fires they were put in
[1:35:08] these things
[1:35:10] hallelujah some through the blood but
[1:35:13] all come to
[1:35:14] christ you see are you committed
[1:35:17] he's committed to you
[1:35:21] he's promised you his promise
[1:35:24] and he will bring it to pass
[1:35:28] isaiah when he prophesied that there
[1:35:29] would be a virgin that would conceive
[1:35:32] it didn't have a time stamp on it
[1:35:35] and it didn't have an expiration date on
[1:35:36] it
[1:35:38] but when that word was anchored and
[1:35:41] hooked
[1:35:42] in the anchor of the mary the the virgin
[1:35:44] mary
[1:35:45] when that word anchored in her womb
[1:35:48] it anchored in her womb and she said be
[1:35:51] it unto me
[1:35:52] according to thy word and when this word
[1:35:55] of this hour
[1:35:56] has been anchored in the womb hallelujah
[1:36:00] when that word has been anchored in your
[1:36:01] womb you'll say be it unto me
[1:36:04] according to thy word according to thou
[1:36:07] we o god
[1:36:08] be it unto me if it makes me act funny
[1:36:11] if it makes me dress funny if it makes
[1:36:13] me dance funny
[1:36:15] be it unto me hallelujah
[1:36:19] what a funny mother's day gift
[1:36:22] do you all well you're committed to your
[1:36:26] children and you want to see
[1:36:28] you want to you you tell them what you
[1:36:29] want to do
[1:36:31] you want to see them what you would you
[1:36:32] tell them pick up their toys
[1:36:34] and it seems like there's a lack of
[1:36:36] commitment sometimes
[1:36:37] they just don't pick up their i told
[1:36:39] johnny johnny you're going to set in
[1:36:41] timeouts this
[1:36:42] is your second strike you're in trouble
[1:36:45] now
[1:36:46] you're just not committed johnny little
[1:36:49] susie i told you to pick up your baby
[1:36:50] dog dresses and put them away
[1:36:52] there's a lack of commitment on your
[1:36:53] part i wonder sometimes if god don't
[1:36:56] talk to us that way
[1:36:57] it looks like there's a little bit of
[1:36:58] lack of commitment on your part it looks
[1:37:00] like you have just forgot
[1:37:01] what i have told you i told you that i
[1:37:04] was big enough
[1:37:05] i told you that i was strong enough i
[1:37:08] told you i was god
[1:37:09] i told you i was with you i told you i
[1:37:12] performed miracles
[1:37:13] i wonder today i'd say if he could look
[1:37:15] out on the church of denominations
[1:37:17] that he could see a people that is
[1:37:19] uncommitted but i say to the bride of
[1:37:22] jesus christ
[1:37:23] there is a commitment on the inside that
[1:37:25] she didn't put there
[1:37:26] but he did
[1:37:30] it's not little johnny little johnny i
[1:37:33] told you
[1:37:34] i told you not to do that i told you
[1:37:37] not to stick your finger in that mouse
[1:37:39] trap i told you it bites you
[1:37:42] you see god loves you so much he don't
[1:37:45] treat you like an ignorant child but he
[1:37:48] comes to you
[1:37:50] and he loves you and though there's a
[1:37:52] trap of the enemy that has set out
[1:37:54] before you
[1:37:55] he comes in and he wraps his arms around
[1:37:59] you
[1:38:00] he says don't go that way walk with me
[1:38:04] walk this way brother howard him was
[1:38:07] trying to sing and bring forth that song
[1:38:10] my way gets brighter my low gets lighter
[1:38:12] walking up the king's highway
[1:38:14] you see he couldn't really sing it
[1:38:15] because you see it was part of this
[1:38:18] sermon that i had to express
[1:38:20] and he didn't know that this was a part
[1:38:22] of even my notes but there's something
[1:38:24] on the inside of you
[1:38:27] that god wraps his arms around you and
[1:38:29] says now look you walk this way
[1:38:32] you see as you begin to walk this way
[1:38:35] you feel as your load gets lighter
[1:38:37] and you lift your eyes towards the sun
[1:38:39] the s-o-n
[1:38:40] and everything around you you just begin
[1:38:42] to understand
[1:38:44] and you watch as god is displayed
[1:38:49] you see he comes and he wraps his arms
[1:38:52] around you
[1:38:54] because he's committed to you
[1:38:58] he's committed to the promise that he
[1:39:01] laid there
[1:39:03] he said that he'd have a bride
[1:39:07] he said that he'd have a bride and she's
[1:39:10] here
[1:39:12] she's on the scene and against all
[1:39:14] denominational odds
[1:39:16] though she's called holy rollers though
[1:39:18] she's mocked and though she's scorned
[1:39:20] though she's made fun of
[1:39:22] for believing this last day's message
[1:39:24] she's still standing
[1:39:26] because god said so because god said so
[1:39:29] in spite of
[1:39:30] all of yourself god said so
[1:39:33] you see you see and when he come and he
[1:39:36] was the fullness
[1:39:38] of the kings the prophets hallelujah
[1:39:41] that god had bodily rested at him
[1:39:44] it rested in him and he come to redeem
[1:39:47] out of there abroad a masterpiece
[1:39:50] a masterpiece that says to satan when he
[1:39:54] says that the days of miracles has
[1:39:56] passed
[1:39:57] that there's no such a thing as these
[1:39:59] things that you're talking about
[1:40:01] notice what that masterpiece says get
[1:40:04] thee behind me satan
[1:40:06] see a masterpiece standing
[1:40:10] and guarding you didn't realize what you
[1:40:13] were doing
[1:40:14] but you're a masterpiece go and listen
[1:40:16] to it that the only
[1:40:17] the gods only provide a way of worship
[1:40:19] that there is a masterpiece standing
[1:40:22] and guarding that word and you watch the
[1:40:25] genes of a man
[1:40:27] you watch that gene of the man is in the
[1:40:29] woman
[1:40:30] and what makes the woman and that's the
[1:40:32] way the word of god is in the church
[1:40:35] that's what makes the church the bride
[1:40:38] the word you stand there guarding that
[1:40:42] word
[1:40:43] guarding that promise
[1:40:47] the bible says in romans 9 11
[1:40:50] that the children being not yet born
[1:40:53] neither
[1:40:54] having done any good or evil that the
[1:40:56] purpose of god
[1:40:57] according to election might stand not of
[1:40:59] works but of him
[1:41:01] that calleth speaking of esau and jacob
[1:41:04] that the perfect purpose of god
[1:41:06] according to election might stand not of
[1:41:08] works
[1:41:09] but of him that calleth you see every
[1:41:11] person
[1:41:12] has their part to play you look at judas
[1:41:16] and you look at peter they both
[1:41:17] had their parts to play in the great
[1:41:20] drama of god
[1:41:21] that some were vessels of honor and some
[1:41:24] are vessels of dishonor that he is the
[1:41:27] potter
[1:41:28] and you and i are the clay and it's he
[1:41:31] that chooses
[1:41:32] that how much of a clump of clay that he
[1:41:35] throws on the wheel
[1:41:36] and then he puts through the fire to
[1:41:38] bring forth his majesty
[1:41:41] though we were sometimes alienated and
[1:41:44] the enemies in our mind
[1:41:46] by wicked works yet now hath he
[1:41:49] reconciled
[1:41:51] you see he is bringing forth
[1:41:55] his portion through your life
[1:42:00] making sons and daughters of god
[1:42:03] to his glory a new creation of god
[1:42:08] notice what the bible says here in
[1:42:10] ephesians 2 and 10
[1:42:12] that we are his workmanship created in
[1:42:15] union
[1:42:16] with christ jesus under good works
[1:42:19] ephesians 4 and 24
[1:42:21] and that ye put on the new man which
[1:42:24] after god is created in righteousness
[1:42:26] and true holiness this new creation
[1:42:29] is not the old creation made over or it
[1:42:32] could not
[1:42:33] be called a new creation that is exactly
[1:42:36] what it says
[1:42:37] it says it is a new creation
[1:42:41] it is another creation distinct from the
[1:42:44] old one
[1:42:46] no longer is he dealing by the ways of
[1:42:48] flesh that was how he
[1:42:50] dealt with israel he chose abraham and
[1:42:52] of abraham's issue
[1:42:53] through the godly isaac line but now
[1:42:56] out of every kindred tribe and nation he
[1:42:59] has purposed
[1:43:01] a new creation he is the first of that
[1:43:04] creation
[1:43:04] he was god created in the form of man
[1:43:07] now by his spirit he is creating many
[1:43:10] sons unto himself god the creator
[1:43:13] creating himself a part of his creation
[1:43:16] that this is the true revelation of god
[1:43:20] this was his purpose
[1:43:24] this purpose took form
[1:43:27] through election that is why he could
[1:43:31] look
[1:43:31] right down to the last age
[1:43:34] when all would be over and see himself
[1:43:37] still in the midst of the church
[1:43:40] as the author of this new creation of
[1:43:41] god
[1:43:43] his sovereign power brought it to pass
[1:43:50] his sovereign power
[1:43:54] brought it to pass
[1:44:00] you look back on the mighty
[1:44:03] manifestations of god
[1:44:05] musicians come you look back at all that
[1:44:08] he did
[1:44:10] in this generation
[1:44:14] it was not done for man's glory
[1:44:17] it was done for his glory
[1:44:20] notice on the backside of the threefold
[1:44:23] purpose
[1:44:25] he's the main one
[1:44:28] good lord willing we'll finish this next
[1:44:30] weekend
[1:44:32] but god is committed to you
[1:44:36] today tomorrow
[1:44:39] and every day in the future
[1:44:43] and it's by his sovereign power that
[1:44:45] he's bringing these things to pass
[1:44:48] god is so good
[1:44:52] to call us in this hour
[1:44:56] and may our hearts be burning with the
[1:44:59] love of jesus christ
[1:45:03] that against our own humanity and
[1:45:04] against our own human flesh
[1:45:06] that god was still committed to us
[1:45:10] when we couldn't bring to pass his
[1:45:13] sovereign will
[1:45:14] his sovereign power brought it to pass
[1:45:18] he came looking for me
[1:45:22] when i couldn't go to him he came
[1:45:23] looking
[1:45:25] for me i could never repay
[1:45:28] the debt i owe to him
[1:45:31] so i will do my very best to serve him
[1:45:35] i believe that it's the commitment of
[1:45:38] sons and daughters of god
[1:45:40] to commit their ways into him
[1:45:45] he was there all
