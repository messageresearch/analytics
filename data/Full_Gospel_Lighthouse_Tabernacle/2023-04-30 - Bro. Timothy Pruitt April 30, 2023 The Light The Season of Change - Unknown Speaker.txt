today and forever father we come this morning Lord where the Hearts bow before you asking God that you had come and you would move and you would touch you administer Lord or we know God you're speaking very directly Lord and we just want to yield ourselves our vessels to you we love you with all of our hearts God we thank you for this opportunity we bless your Holy Name Lord and we want to give you the preeminence do what you do what you do we ask it in Jesus name amen amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen I just want to say it's been an honor to be in the meetings there with brother Ron and the other ministers there for Sean's church just a wonderful atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and amen we need those times we need those moments and need those kind of services every service amen we just need the Lord to have preeminence and to have the freedom to work and last night I thought was just amazing over the top and amen the greatest of all time how about that amen amen this gives you such courage to see what God is doing and and to know his word is true if you trust me I'll use you like never before amen Gospel Lighthouse you have to save that's nothing but the truth amen listen let me tell you it goes beyond these four walls right here but there's unseen millions that have watched and drawed courage and and hear from them all the time of of what God has done right here before your very eyes amen it's not something that's done in just a little room but God has put it out there before the world and we're thankful for his grace and his grace is sufficient amen his grace is sufficient amen God bless you let's turn the habakkuk 2 in verse 2. amen just like to say it's an honor to be with you and of course bring you greetings from my home church and my father brother Tim and amen I know he'd love to be here as well but he's home ministering this morning and he said send me a text I'm at church and I'm ready to fight amen amen I believe that ought to be our attitude to every one of us not just preachers but every one of us we're going to fight for everything God has for us and we're not going to let one inch go to the devil not one inch of our inheritance not one place God has given us it belongs to him or we're going to take every bit of him glad to have sister Ruth sister Katie with us today and amen I I've been hearing this all through the night and preached this at home right before I left but just feel to bring it again this morning amen the light the season of change I believe we're in a season of change and I believe I'm here to tell you Gospel Lighthouse you are in a season of change amen habakkuk 2 and verse 2 the Lord answered me and said write the vision make it plain upon the tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it Terry wait for it because it will surely come it will not Tarry Amen in other words it's going to come at the moment God has predestinated for it to happen and as we know you can line every devil up and he can't stop it from coming to pass also Isaiah 40 and verse 28 says hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength and they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles and they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint amen God bless you and be seated amen I'm just reading this a while ago and it just struck me it says write the vision and make it plain that he may run that readeth it in other words when you read what God has written and it becomes a revelation that this is your moment in this time it gives you strength to accomplish what the vision says now in other words God is not just going to give you a word but leave you without the strength to fulfill the word amen but God's going to give you what you have need of in your moment and your hour of need now many times we go through seasons of life and we know as the world that we live in there's there's many many seasons we go through uh you know spring winter fall summer all those things and we know that light we could go into it of how light affects and it causes seasons to change the Bible says in Genesis there he put the Sun and the Moon lights there in the heavens for the seasons and for the times and so the sun will begin to move and it'll begin to change and the Earth will begin to change amen as that light begins to get stronger it changes the seasons that goes on upon the Earth but many times in those moments especially in Winter or or in the dry summer and you know we all love the beautiful spring or the wonderful cool fall or whatever the change of colors but it's those winter times or there's summer times it can be very long embarrassing and it'd be heavy on our spirits and things and and even in the spiritual Realms we all go through seasons of life amen but you know but it's in those moments of waiting amen but listen God does not waste the waiting times or the times of waiting and I got to looking at that word wait it means to remain in a place of Readiness or expectation of something amen it's not just sitting there twiddling your thumbs thinking nothing's going on but even when you don't see it you know it's still going to take place even when you don't see him working you know he's still moving on the scene amen you know you go to airplane and go get on the airplane you're waiting for that plane to come and you can't see that plane it may be up in the sky somewhere and but sooner or later you're expecting it's going to land and come to the gate and you'll get on your seat amen so you're in this in a place of Readiness or a place of expectation and many times we find ourselves in a seizing of waiting and we're waiting on the Lord to move us move something in our life or help us in a hard situation or or certain maybe Financial things whatever it is and we're often waiting from God for many things and and in those sea but in those seasons of waiting God is still there amen he's using those times just as effective as effectively as he's using the good times and the hard times he is transforming us into the likeness of Christ Jesus in the times of waiting are never wasted they're just a part of the process amen but in those times of waiting amen you need to be ready that any moment is going to change because I promise you the season that you find yourself in this morning is not going to remain forever but it's going to change amen it's going to move you know I was looking here at Israel they went through many seasons of their life they would go through seasons of slavery they would go through seasons of Freedom they'd go through Seasons again of captivity they would go through seasons of taking the land and dealing with things that was there there was all kinds of seasons of their life in Psalms 137 they they were going through a season of captivity and they began to read they begin to write about this and they said by the Rivers of Babylon we were set down yay we wept when we remembered Zion and we hung our Harps upon the willow trees in the midst thereof for there they had carried us away captive and required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mercy and sing it as a song of Zion but how can we sing the song The Lord's song In a Strange Land see they had hung their Harps up and their song was taken seemed like their Destiny seemed like their purpose seemed like their future was in doubt they were captives physically emotionally but to them God was far away and they never was going to return but that season did not last forever amen it was a season of captivity a time when they didn't feel the worship they didn't feel the joy they once had felt before they had been brought into a season because of their sins now we go through seasons of life we wasn't ever meant to be where we are through changing of Seasons it came because of the Fall amen but what God and His Mercy has allowed us to realize that these are seasons for our good and for our our learning and for our our our building up of our character and God is working through every season of our life and here they were exiled from the presence of God but God rich and mercy changed the season amen you were once taught one time in captivity we we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity but thank God he changed that season of our life to where now we're Sons and Daughters of the king amen amen when you know signs of living in captivity or the loss of your dream or or the loss of your life or the loss of your joy or the loss of your testimony the loss of your hope the loss of your fruitfulness but remember you don't change Seasons you adjust the seasons you know when it's winter time you can't change the season much as we would love to sometimes I know up here you know it gets really a lot colder than where I am and so what do you do you go put a coat on but you don't expect to wear that coat forever amen you don't expect that you're going to wear that the rest of your life but sooner or later the light's going to change and the season is going to change and the coat will be put back over there again amen see God is showing you even in nature that what you're going through the season of your life is not going to stay the same amen because Seasons don't last they change the good news winter may be now but spring is on the way amen Suddenly It's spring suddenly it's changed and you don't even know how you made it through the winter but God helped you every step of your way every part of your journey God has had a part in your life see God won't leave you where you're at always I mean they won't always stay there suddenly things will begin to change suddenly sorrow can turn into Joy suddenly change can fall off and freedom be released suddenly you may be Barren one moment and full of life the next moment amen suddenly things can take place God is a God who can move very quickly amen it may seem like forever but all of a sudden one moment you're one way and the next moment you're changed one mom One Step Enoch was in this body and the next step he was translated this is where we're headed to One Step you may even get up in the morning and you may feel all down but something on the inside still burning and you say God you're God and you just take one step and all of a sudden you felt a chain sweep over here and it's all over with hey man it can happen very quickly it can happen very suddenly amen you say well where is that at well let me show you Acts chapter 2 and verse one it said when the day of Pentecost was fully calm they were all in one Accord in one place and suddenly amen one moment a denier one moment backsliding away from God one moment amen are cursing and doing all those same but suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled the house Acts chapter 9 and verse 3 as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly they're signed round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying Saul Saul why persecute us thou me in one moment on a high horse in the next moment on your face before God crying out for mercy let me tell you his parents don't you ever give up on your children amen you don't know when that light's going to come across their path and knock them off their high horse and bring them face to face with almighty God it can happen suddenly One Moment In the bar room and the next day sitting right here one moment sinner one moment of drug hand one moment a dopehead and the next day dancing and praising God for the Saving Grace of almighty God [Applause] don't you ever give up [Music] don't you ever give up God can move very quickly Hallelujah Acts chapter 25 and at midnight Paul verses about sorry chapter 16 verse 25 at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them and suddenly one moment bound and the next moment free oh I believe it's going to happen in this service this morning one moment pound and the next moment free [Applause] one moment carrying all the weight of all your past and condemnation and the next moment I pray it's over with God moved on my behind amen well I ain't done that you sounds pretty well let me change words here same thing immediately your season can change amen Matthew 8 and verse 2 and behold there came a leper and worship him saying Lord if thou wilt thou can't make me thou can make me clean and Jesus put his forth his hand and touched him saying I will be thou clean and immediately immediately his leprosy was cleansed amen some of you need to take courage in that right there amen leprosy is a type of sin the devil wants to keep reminding you you did this and you did this and you did this and I got witness here and I got witness there but I want to tell you something devil he touched me [Applause] and the same God to touch that leper and one moment he was full of cankers he was full of swords and the next moment he was cleansed Hallelujah let me tell you the devil wants to hang your past over you he wants to hang all of that over here I'm here to tell you there's a loose in here this morning you can see the vision of God I have been touched by the angel of almighty God I didn't do this he did it he did it and when he does it he does it well Hallelujah Mark chapter 1 and verse 29 for with when they would come out of the synagogue the end of the House of Simon and Andrew and James and John with Simon's wife mother lay sick of a fever and none they tell him of her and he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up and immediately the fever left her we're living in that same time Hallelujah amen Mark chapter 2 and verse 10. but that you may know that the son of man hath power on the earth to forgive sins he said to the sick of the palsy I say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into that house and immediately arose and he took up his bed and went from before them all in so much they are All Amazed and glorified God we never saw it on this fashion how they brought it out in the chosen amen when they we went down to the well uh Bethesda and there's that lame man walking there or laying there and he was walking after but he was laying there and he goes down and said do you want to be healed he said well I have nobody to take me he said that's not what I asked you I ask you do you want to be healed amen how many excuses do we give God well nobody loves me nobody cares for me nobody understands do you want to be healed well nobody nobody nobody has called me nobody has done this do you want to be healed and we know the story he healed the man and he got up and he said you take your bed and you leave this place and we know what they and I thought it was so wonderful they caught that inspiration Peter said he told you to take it because you're not coming back [Applause] Hey listen this is the time that you don't sleep something behind just in case I'm going to come back there I'm not going back who's the son is set free is free and tea it has been my season to be blessed it's been my season that God has come on my behalf and I'm not going back devil I'm not going back and you're not clamping down on me and saying who you think you are dancing and shouting who do you think you are giving God praise I am who I am because the I am told me who I am therefore I have a right [Applause] Hallelujah you have a right you have a right [Applause] Hallelujah Lord chapter 10 and verse 46 and they came to Jericho and they went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus Sat by the highwayside began and when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry and say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and many many charged him that he should hold his peace apparently they'd never been blind amen if they had been sitting where he was sitting they had been crying like he was crying if they would have saw what he is gave that a paradox that a blind man could see better those that had eyes amen what was it others were relying on this right here and this sense right here and say well that's an illegitimate child that's just the son of Mary and Joseph that's just a human that that can't be God but a blind man sitting over there in the corner and he said what's all the noise about well it's just Jesus passing by Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me you need to be quiet you're causing the rock Jesus hallelujah amen people wonder why amen why why is people making so much noise why is it happening why is there such excitement amen why because whenever Jesus is there's a lot of noise hey there's those that don't believe him they're screaming at him crucified but there's others that say that's my Lord that's my king that's my God and there's others that has needs and saying Jesus and there's others that knew who he was because of what he did for them oh Hallelujah that leper was walking with him those blinds that he healed already were walking with him all those ones that had been through his prayer lines were walking with him and they were rejoicing saying Hosanna blessed be the name of the Lord so all I can tell somebody that Doug wants to tell me to sell shut up and sit down in my Pew well apparently you ain't experienced the Jesus I've experienced apparently you haven't experienced someone I have witnessed you know there's a boy one time brother Brandon prayed for in a wheelchair and he was sitting there and brother around and prayed for him and I believe I remember right he told him he was healed but he was still in the wheelchair and he started confessing like John Ryan he started saying thank God by his stripes I'm Healed and he was screaming it out causing such a Ruckus it was preachers that was coming like look man you're causing this is a shame on the lord's name let me tell you something you'll never shame God by confessing his word you will shame God by denying his word amen but this man said look he find all these preachers gathered around and said look man you're causing a big Ruckus you're causing a shame he said look he said if you were sitting where I'm sitting you wouldn't take the last hope that I got away from me to weld up on the inside of him and he said by his stripes I'm Healed right in the face of all those critics right in the face of all that he had been waiting a long time for this moment but immediately out of the wheelchair he came giving God praise you don't know when your moment's coming but whatever you do you keep speaking the word of God you keep speaking the word of God by his tribe the word of God is my joy it is my help in the time of struggle it is my Pavilion I can hide behind [Applause] Hallelujah he said go back to blind Bartimaeus many charged him but you know what he did the script was reading Mark chapter 10 and verse 8. many charged him that he should hold his peace amen sorry I think I said the wrong one Mark chapter 10 and verse 48 how about that one yeah charged him he said hold his peace but [Applause] he sat down and shut up no he cried the more a great deal y'all y'all just a little fanatical you don't like that watch this you're not going to get me to shut up when Jesus was walking through the room you're not going to get me to sit down and just fold my arms act like nothing's happening when he's moving and he's healing and he's delivering I'm seeing the signs of the Messiah Among Us no sir I'm going to cry even a great deal louder I'm going to worship a great deal more I want to give more myself [Applause] foreign and Jesus Stood Still oh cry reached something brother Brown said that Christ stopped heaven and Christ stopped heaven and he commanded him to be called and they called the blind man said be of good Comfort rise he called us for thee Oh My and he casting away His Garment what he Cast Away that old Beggar's Garden he already had the faith I'm not going to need that no more he Cast Away the Garment and he began to walk towards Jesus and Jesus said unto him will what will that I should do unto thee he said Lord that I may receive my sigh and Jesus said go thy way thy faith has made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way you think that shut the critics up no they still crucified him and saw what had just happened we will never shut them up they are fulfilling scripture but also I'm fulfilling scripture you're fulfilling scripture Luke chapter 8 and verse 43 says a woman have an issue of blood 12 years which is spent all of her living upon Physicians neither could be healed of any came behind him and touched the border of His Garment and immediately her issue of blood staged you don't know when you're immediately is going to happen but the vision's been spoke it will come to pass amen Acts chapter 3 and verse 6 Peter says Silver and Gold Have I None but such I have give unto thee in the name of Jesus Christ of nazarus to rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and his feet and ankle bones receive strength and he leaped and stopped stood and walked and entered with him into the temple walking and leaping and praising God and all the people saw him walking and praising God and they knew it was he who sat at the arms at the gate called beautiful and they were filled with wondering amazing of what had happened unto him see when omnipotent speaks the miraculous takes place seasons change very quickly you know in every Junction or season of change he speaks and when he speaks the miraculous is poured out hang with me for a moment omnipotence is how the quality of having unlimited power so we're not talking about a source that's going to run out he's not going to run out of healing he's not going to run out of Deliverance he's going to deliver everyone whose name is on the book so he's not going to run out of it he's not going to be empty of it it's always going to be there God help me this morning it's a miraculous to that vindicates the omnipotence only the miraculous can do that the teaching of the words very fine but because faith comes by hearing and hearing the word but it takes a miraculous to vindicate that the omnipotent still lives and he still Reigns we must have the miraculous I believe we have witnessed the greatest showing of the power of His unlimited power amen we have so been showed over and over the miraculous but I don't believe God's done yet amen so Lord let's don't get law to sleep and say well that was 60 years ago no God's not finished amen the biggest outpouring of the miraculous is about to take place when these bodies are changed you talking about miraculous amen when these bodies that are broken bodies of humanity and every kind of evil thought can go through every kind of spirit of heavenness can fall upon them but all of a sudden immediately it can take place I know we're in the season of change amen before great Junction or ending of time where he starts something new God always comes and shows his power hear me God always comes and shows his power but men Through the Ages always breaks it down and teaches it away that's a direct quote and explains it away gets away from the real living God but just before his Junctions are in and into a new dispensation he appears on the scene with great miraculous signs and wonders he always does that always let me tell you something else is always witnessed at a junction his angels he's always present the angel of the Lord go through the Bible Our Father Abraham what started to change the visitation I'm just going very quickly what started the change in Moses the visitation what started the chains and Samson's day the visitation amen what started the change for Daniel and the three Hebrew children the visitation it's not just the Old Testament well what started in the New Testament the visitation Angels were present all through the Bible at every Junction and every time and they're still present today that's not a myth or a hope so or it might be or maybe that's the saith the Lord the angels are still present today and they're still showing witness amen we're in a moment of change we're in a moment God is going to outpour his Spirit or pour His Spirit out and on upon All Flesh it's what happened in our day amen what happened what started to change that we've been under the angel visit the prophet well the prophets went on but the Angel's still here amen he's still in charge of this don't ever let that slip your mind I know it's dark all around us and things are getting even darker I mean we have went off a cliff on in this nation listen we ain't turned the corner we've went off a cliff this nation has went off into a bottomless pit it's in a season of change too it's a different kind of change not a change I want but it's going to change this beautiful nation and nothing but smoke bombs and craters that's not saith the Lord it's going to happen amen so they're getting in the atmosphere for the change amen Sodom and Gomorrah we've been we've been saying it you know talking about being among us but now we can say it's here I mean they fell off such a cliff they don't know where there's no stopping point there's no place that they can stop and say hey we're going too far no they can't stop this train amen they went off into you know people becoming animals and every and now they got to ride up it's on the Fox News of people who can now identify as a handicapped person I mean that's that's nonsense insanity but we notice that during the time of this great turmoil let me back up a little bit talking about the first Junction the first destruction the flood Noah's day he said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man we notice that during the time of this great turmoil when men's Hearts will begin to wax cold and away from God women become such an idol Hallelujah when sons of God sing the daughters of men that they were fair and they become a sexual object how the great turmoil in this world today we realize that one things has caused it the Bible said Spirits great spirits come down evil spirits and God in these people and done these things and we see the same evil spirits working in our day but notice again not only that he said but when when all hell turns loose all Heaven's going to turn loose that ought to give us courage because we can sure see hell turning loose we can sure sin but I'm gonna hear the declarity I can also see Heavens turning loose the Seeker being healed the dead are being raised the prodigals are coming home angels are being disapprised and saying go get this one go get that one this is mine that's mine that's my son out there go get him hallelujah amen see when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard against it while all evil is going on in the world at that time at the same time God had a witness on Earth Enoch who walked with God blameless at the same time evil was appearing Angels appeared on earth a type of today as the evil is appearing so is good appearing if I was you I'd prepare for a visitation [Applause] Hallelujah back there in that evil day just before the destruction when God had a man out preaching the gospel a poor man a humble man a man who had a heart to listen to God that's the kind of man of God you want not to listen to you but to listen to God Noah was preaching a message that seemed so crazy to the world he was preparing to Ark a place of safety that was a miracle in its own listen I went and I went myself up there went up there to uh that Ark I said you know what I said brother Andrew is an honest truth I'm glad God didn't make me nowhere that place is huge It seems impossible that a man with a few Sons could build such as that you know and it seems impossible that animals would come and get on this Ark I've always said this enough because this way just bear with me perhaps it'll be a doubter during that day and you're kind of hanging around the ark looking at all that's going on and all of a sudden Out of the Woods come walking these animals I'm in line call me what you want to I want on that boat hey man listen it's more than just a meme he said you need to fight I seen a meme the other day somebody sent me said you need to fight like you the third monkey that's going to get on the ark and brother it's about to rain raindrops are falling on your head listen that ought to be our desire I fight for this body change I'm gonna fight for this Supernatural I'm going to fight for the glory of God I'm going to fight for God I'm going to fight for his people because I see it already coming the judgment is coming upon this Earth we gotta get out of here and we are in the season of the body change [Applause] laughs amen we're he said no it was working away Not only was he performing a miracle he was looking for a miracle oh I love that he putting another nail preaching a sermon 120 years he preached the same sermon boy I can't wait to go to brother Noah's Church you sit down it's going to rain 50 years you decide to go back again and you sit down it's going to rain you better get on this Ark 100 years to go by and you decide one more time to give brother Noah a chance it's going to rain you know we get mad at our preachers when it comes from the same text more than once what you don't realize God is trying to deal with something he's trying to get you into a place of safety it's for your good it's not for your bad it's not for your harm it's not for your demise men of God don't get up to tear you down they get up there and preach the word of God for your safety for your deliverance get mad at him if you want to [Applause] I don't want to we are preparing he said same as today we are preparing for a miracle the Rapture of the church the going home preparing people getting people unburdened from the things of the world getting their souls set with the presence of God and when Jesus disappear the second time in glory those who are ready will be raptured and we'll be caught up together to meet him in the air and listen that's not a fairy tale that's not a hope so or maybe or some it is the saith the Lord Noah began to warn the people and preach many in life scoffed many of his message seem entirely unreasonable but he went on to warning the people judgment is coming judgment is coming God with his great omnipotent power we're speaking there and touching hearts and touching life he said so it is a day he said it had never rained before it was all kind of Skeptics well you make brother Noah it's going to rain this ain't never happened before he said there's people in the world today after 2 000 years of gospel preaching don't even yet know what it means to be born again of the spirit of God they don't know what omnipotence means how that God and his great omnipotent power can transform a soul from a street sinner to Angelic position in God's kingdom as a son or daughter of God they don't understand it they're too taken up infatuated with the things of the world flirting with the world don't realize that's an evil spirit it's a great marking signpost for the people today to watch and be ready and Jesus said when these things begin to come to pass lift up your head the season is about to change amen your Redemption draweth nigh he showed it through Enoch the world laughed at it but one day thunder and lightning started popping one day there was no longer invited they were begging suddenly well you said it took it to 120 years no it went from no clouds to rain and the first Rangers started beating what is this and before they know it they're standing in the Fulfillment of what Noah had been preaching 120 years and all those words begin to run through their mind I gotta get to that Ark I got to get to that Arc and they begin to run and beat on the doors but no one said look I can't do nothing I didn't shut the door listen it ain't a man that's going to shut the door God's going to shut the door so therefore it ain't a man that can declare Mercy's over no God declares when it's done amen When God says it it's finished but before it is every name that's on that book will be in hallelujah oh my so many things we can go through the first Exodus of Israel how they how they came out of their their season of uh of of of slavery and been 400 years in that season seemed like it was going to last forever but no season lasts forever all of a sudden our light falls down on a bush and it meets a backslidden prophet on the backside of a desert and a voice begins to speak to him and reveal what his questions had been on his heart and why he's even there and gives him a word said you go down to Egypt and you tell Pharaoh let my people go what was that that when Moses spoke it that was more than the voice of Moses that was omnipotent speaking and through omnipotence flies came and lies came and balls came and fire and hellstone came and the death angel came by the voice of omnipotence Miracles took place and come up to the Red Sea brother Ron spoke about it last night I always love this story because it represents brother Brian talks about it represents the blood of Jesus and he said he said he said they come up to it and he said it didn't look like it was possible to go through it and what happened they immediately forgot what had happened in Egypt and they just all of a sudden they looked at the mountain the Sea and the big cloud of dust coming behind them it said Moses was there not any graves in Egypt that we could just die there but you brought us out in the wilderness and they began to cry to him and Moses turned to God and God said why are you crying to me for speak and go forward and Moses held out that rod and he spoke and there was wind began to blow and it opened up the Red Sea let me tell you something it wasn't just a little bitty Gap for two million people to go across and one night it took a wide opening and it wasn't trodden through the mud they went across on dry ground and they get to the other side and all of a sudden Miriam realized hey I ain't a slave no more because there had been a voice of omnipotent spoke and it said that Egyptians that you see today you'll see no more forever I always thought that was something because they saw him later the Bible says it they saw him floating there in the Red Sea but what was the difference they wasn't the same Egyptians no more they had no breath in their body they had no ability to pick up a will not one more time they were dead Hallelujah when you can realize that God can come on your behalf and move in just a moment and the Egyptian had been whipping you and whipping you all of a sudden the voice of omnipotence feet and said let my people go Hallelujah and you realize hey he don't have no charge over me no more it's over with it's over with it's finished oh that'll cause you to grab a tambourine and it cause you to dance and it'll cause you to have joy in your heart and it'll cause you to worship the King of Kings and the Lord of lords because he has took my enemy and he's drowned him in his blood he took my drugs he took my alcohol he took my pornography and he drowned it in the blood of Jesus Christ and they have no more power I'm here to tell you Full Gospel Lighthouse your enemy don't have power over you no more he don't have power over you no more he might at one time held you under a sleigh bell but you're not a slave no more am I talking to some free people this morning speaking the unreasonable thinking of a man can never comprehend the miraculous but when you've come in contact with omnipotence when you do that you're in contact with the supernatural your life changes your thinking changes your mind changes you're made different your sickness is finished God's Great Power Moves In he's in the room he's been witnessed their same Angel is here again he's in the room Hallelujah omnipotent spoke and speaks and the word comes to pass in Israel times a magnificent speaks and it comes the word comes to pass Abraham's time omnipotent spoke and it came to pass and he said I will perform the supernatural about this time next year I'll visit you according to life your wife a hundred years old will bring forth a child I'll show you my divine power of healing I'll change you and Turn you back to a young man again I'll change Sarah and make her a new woman I'm the miraculous I'm the omnipotent I do those things [Music] omnipotent spoke and brought a son forth what seemed impossible Mercy omnipotence is speaking we're going down to his day lepers whatever I will be thy clean omnipotent spoke leversy disappeared when omnipotent speaks miraculous takes place lepersy vanish omnipotent speak he promised in the last days he will speak again he will speak again when omnipotent speaks a miraculous takes place he healed the sick he raised the dead he opened the eyes of the blind omnipotent spoken said I have power to lay my life down I have power to take it up again no man can take it away from me no devil can take it away from you Hallelujah he did all the miraculous while omnipotence God was manifested in flesh speak the word Lord and my servant will be healed and he spoke and it was done Hallelujah you stood at the grave of Lazarus crying like a man in his flesh Martha said Lord if you'd only been here my brother not die but even now even now omnipotent speaks whatever you ask God God will do it whatever you say he will do it and he walked to the Grave omnipotence manifested among us living among us God in Christ reconciling the world to himself he lived with us God proven himself that is through his son Jesus Christ he was omnipotence and the miraculous followed and if he's the same yesterday today and forever he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world how can we look for anything else but the miraculous so here it goes down to the Grave weeping and then omnipotence gathered itself together my my dad spoke this here a while back he said well Jesus wept he said why did he weep because he knew where Lazarus was and he had to bring him back from that place back to here we don't understand those things it's hard to comprehend those just went on they don't want to come back here I I guess it's okay we get all emotional and we wish him happy birthday they ain't worried about birthdays there's a Day Without End I mean think about it brother Branham was when he went past the curtain of time he's laying there with his hands behind him his wife's next to him children in the Next Room really a healthy body I mean he's worn out no doubt been through a lot of things but still a nice healthy body he wasn't he wasn't dying with a brain bleed he wouldn't he didn't have a heart problem heart issues her body that had wasted away he's laying there and he goes past there and he's getting to see all those things and all the things that were revealed to him in those moments and he said all of a sudden I felt my body going myself going back and he's beginning to cry do I have to go back here's a man laying beside his wife he loves children in the Next Room right over there and he's saying do I have to go back we don't understand what awaits us on the other side but it's more real than what you're having going through right now and of course well there's that you can't even put a number to it how much better it is gives me great courage because you know losing a mom but in her condition even I don't want her to come back and be in that condition but you don't want to come back to this but play Old pest house nonsense we're having to go through right now and we're we're seeing all these things around us sometimes it gets our nerves stirred up and we get worried listen you got to go back to what the word said and here he is weeping but he said omnipotence gathered itself together and word spoke Lazarus come forth and brother remember said if he wouldn't have said Lazarus there'd have been a general Resurrection amen Lazarus come up and a man that was already rotten in his nose fell in his face in four days the skin worms had done said it corruption now knew its master and it gives the life of this dead man back again and he lived the miraculous I am the resurrection and the life not I will be I am as we bring this on go back to Israel Harps are on a tree song is gone they're weeping but one day that season ended this is where I want to bring you to

sing when the lord gave that to me sitting on a Pew there as brother Ron and then was speaking my mother's Memorial the spirit Spirit of the Lord spoke and said I'm giving you a new song to sing you're not always sing this song or no morning [Applause] amen sometimes we get caught up in that song and we begin to sing things you know all kind of songs begin to come out of our life and it begins to go and flow out and the devil's trying to put songs of mourning I mean I'm depressed I'm depressed every day that I live I'm depressed when I wake up in the morning when I lay my head to

want to be there don't you hallelujah oh my I can read about Daniel Daniel and Daniel chapter 2 we're bringing this down Daniel chapter 2 and verse 19 it says when the Seeker was revealed unto Daniel in a night vision brother Timothy is dark it's like it's almost night it's so dark but in this night he brings a vision he don't leave his people without a vision where there's no vision the people perish we have a vision that we're following come on now amen in this night vision then Daniel blessed God of heaven and Daniel answered and said blessed be the name of God forever and ever for wisdom and might are his he changes the times and the seasons he removeth Kings and he saideth up Kings what were Kings Kings were ones that had Dominion for a season there's no command king that's ever had Dominion for eternity you know what I mean even David he's had David the greatest king of Israel he lived for just a certain season amen men are raised up right now we're under a government this government that is here and it's gonna that's gonna we're gonna go to the end whatever happened it's only for a season Russia's government is for a season amen but he raises so even sicknesses or kings are given Dominion but they're only for seasons and he'll raise them up and he'll bring them down he allow under a rule for a moment then he'll tear them down yeah amen you can see it in the children of Israel they would go into captivity and come back go back into captivity come back what was it God will allow Kings to raise up but when it was time for the word to be fulfilled he would tear them down amen it didn't matter how big the walls were how big it was and what seemed impossible that mattered nothing to God when it was time for his people to go free he tore them down and so it is with sickness or any kind of spirit of hell they may be raised up for a moment and allowed a certain time or a certain season but when God says it's finished it's over with it doesn't matter if it's been years or has been monster it's been days it does not matter amen the vision will take place it will be fulfilled it will not tarry when it's time to be fulfilled so he changes the times and the seasons he removes Kings and set us up Kings he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge of them to no understanding he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what's in the Darkness you know all he said as a kid I wasn't scared of the dark I was scared of what's in the dark you know I I mean he's ever woke up in your night time and you wake up and you don't hung a coat or something in an odd place and there's just enough light there that kind of somebody's in my room and you're going to panic mode and you're ready to fight whatever you got to do to survive I've heard people grabbing the gun blasting holes through their own coat but this God give us a vision that we can see those things that are in the night night vision you know man is has tried to Earth or even the devil whatever man every man in his knowledge has tried to imitate what God has he's tried to get as close as he can to traveling like a thought now we got AI that's coming up big in the news listen that stuff is real you can actually punch something in and it'll give you something it's actually as if it knows all things hello somebody do you see where man's at then where are we going to be because that's a perversion hey man that's a perversion so if we see it getting to that place where should we be getting to amen amen he said I I he knoweth the things that are in the dark then The Light dwelleth Within him I thank the embrace the old thou God my father who would give me wisdom in my and hath made known unto me now what we desired of thee for thou has not made now made known unto us the king's matter Hallelujah I'm looking at a people a man that has been given a vision from the King Hallelujah didn't come from a man didn't come from a seventh grade Kentuckian preacher this Vision came from the King and it gave us this Vision so we can have strength to run the race that we are in Paul ran his Aurelius Reign his Martin Luther all goes down to the seven churches down to our age the layout of sin now it's your turn to run and there's a whole cloud of witnesses brother Homer screaming out Gospel Lighthouse run Karen Brooks screaming out run it's worth it it's one thing you don't know the joys that awaits you here on the other side run with everything you got take the vision the king's matter that has been declared unto you and run the race has been said before you and if there's anything hindering you throw it off cast aside everything that hinder lay it aside right now and say God I've heard the king's Vision I've heard this as a king's matter and I'm going to run till I cross that finish line and I'm going to give it everything I got hahaha because you don't know when the last Hill's coming foreign we got some kind of anointing on his own or what happened we got to ride in these bicycles around our Circle we ain't got Hills like these Hills but we got some hills and they hurt that was before I knew they had electric bicycles I know we're we're huffing and puffing up that hill and that one live that last Hill by my house is the worst Hill around our whole area longest Hill and I'm refusing to get off I'm refusing like brother and I'm looking brother Tim he's pushing I said brother Tim wonderful thing about this it's the last Hill this is the last deal right around that corner is my home and inside there are some icings maybe some sweet tea or some water and a good place to sit down and rest this is the last Hill listen we don't know which one is the last but what if this was the last Hill what if this was the last mile what if this was the last moments here and we just got just a few days or a few minutes what are you going to do then are you going to push a little harder are you going to get it a little deeper are you going to go a little further I'm here to tell you there will be a last Hill there will be a last moment and we are right at that time this is not the time to get off this is the time to stay with a ship and sell it into the harbor [Applause] oh you said you're preaching like you don't ever go through saying well let me tell you something we all go through things every one of us a few more minutes I'm studying on this thought to actually preach the change of seasons and then preach this one the season of change and on Friday of the Wednesday I don't remember just a few Wednesdays last Wednesday I was home I've been me and sister Ruth been going through some things and situations Our Lives and I don't want to paint it like a terrible picture but listen I don't care how what what degree you're going through it's hard life is hard head is best I mean sure there's degrees that are harder and you can always find something somebody going through something worse than you're going through of course the devil wants to point you it's like you're the only one doing going through this and you're the only yeah maybe I'm not talking to people that you're the only one you know you do this that and the other whatever so Friday I studied this sermon here had already had it done before the preview the Wednesday I was going to preach it man the devil is on me because sister Ruth just went through some tests and looking at some uh the doctor found what he calls an audit is a little spot in the back of her brain that we're supposed to see about June and so with that and then some Financial issues from different things and it just hammered me you know I kind of become kind of be real for a moment I think it's okay to be real here yeah I've seen I've seen it happen yeah we believe in being listen I ain't interested in being fake here several years ago I think it was was it 18 19 something like that was here we looked at it the other day but I'm 46 and I forget very quickly oh anyway I I I you know had in my mind that I was going to go into business and do do some things and hey it seemed like it was working out and I was going to I had people that was going to jump in with me and come here to this place and I was going to preach the Saturday and Sunday that was when I was having Sunday night so it had been a while back and uh I never forget it was when I'm open over the Ron's for dinner on Saturday and we did we didn't discuss nothing like that didn't nothing at all just had a good time of fellowshipping and uh left and got ready for the service and never forget he walked in the back room and he said it's gonna be a great weekend you know had that look in his eyes I said yeah I'm believing that he said uh for you I said well praise the Lord so the next day we went up on the mountain with him brother Andrew and their families I don't remember who all was there but a good portion of us and uh we're up on the mountain we stopped at this Overlook and and I was just looking as beautiful y'all live in a beautiful place don't ever let it become common do you know well I don't well listen I was just in Flagstaff and a guy told me in Flagstaff I wish I lived in a beautiful place Grand Canyon's right there come on Things become very common saying some of this stuff for a reason our services can become common preachers can become common amen so you know when I was looking at this place and we got through and we got to go into vehicles and brothers was in ones and sisters and another brother runs I believe this is the place and he began to tell me about how he spoke to different ones about their businesses and I'm thinking boy my little Greenhouse is going to go from 10 by 20 to 5 Acres I mean it's going to be amazing and he looks at me and says but the Lord spoke to me yesterday and so I went to try to take a nap and he said I couldn't sleep went into my office Lord began to speak to me about you and he says tell him he's not to go into business but he's my servant and I'll take care of him [Music] I'll be honest with you that wasn't what I was looking for but I took it from the Lord and God I have to say God has been moved in such a way and God changed things even in the financial Realms it's been wonderful just trusting him and and you know and but then all of a sudden I come to this season of time and it seemed like everything was just pushing down a pipe all at once and I'm just getting more discouraged more discouraged and sick in my body been like it had been like that for a month you know right at a couple of weeks now now a month and and I'm just like Lord why me what's going on what am I doing and and it just culminated there Saturday night in my emotional realm and then Sunday after I led to sing and I come to the back and I just collapsed on the chair back there and I just cried out to God I said God whatever don't let me become bitter let me hold let me stay I I don't want to walk away from what you've told me that's about me I want to stay there in that place God but God I need you I need you and so I just say they'll just come out of me as I pray now and you know listen Hey listen a song leader don't always feel like getting up and leading singing a preacher don't always feel like getting up and preaching you ought to know that amen but God has called us for it is commissioned us for it and so sometimes we gotta put our Smiles on and go out there and preach or sing the songs of Zion whatever it takes and I understand you don't always feel like being where you're at you don't always feel like sitting in the seat that you sit in but if you'll just push past that and just say God you got it right now I can't do nothing about it but I know you'll take care of it he will he will amen so on Monday morning brother Tim calls me so I need to go to the grocery store and we don't go man I said sure I jumped in with him and I go and we have a little time of Fellowship he drops me off back at the house I picked up a few groceries and took them inside and sister Ruth and my daughter-in-law and Katie sister Emily and Katie was taking seen them taking a walk so I went in the house sat on the couch there was looking at some texts and answering some things and sister Ruth come in a few minutes later she said here I got something for you and I looked at it and it was a card and opened up this card and instead of just a note of appreciation for the life that is lived just want to thank you for all that you've done and text and the things you've encouragement you've sent me in my family use this as a gift for whatever you want I flip that over it wasn't just enough it was more than enough [Music] but let me tell you a little secret we had not been home on Friday we've been out at the place there with my dad at the lake and on Saturday brother Aaron ogsby's dad had passed away and we went from there come by the house briefly didn't check the mail Friday didn't check it on Saturday amen when I called the brother on my or text him on Monday he said I was wondering what in the world he said I sent that a week ago and I began to realize when sister Ruth brought that in the mail on Monday hadn't even run yet so while I'm crying out to God God already had the answer [Applause] you know what God was saying just go to your mailbox it's already there Hallelujah maybe you've been crying out to God for weeks or days let me tell you something there's a love letter there for you it's already in the mailbox just go take what you have need of if you need Joy go get you some Joy if you need the Holy Ghost go get it it's already waiting on you foreign Jason Jackson text me during that moment he said I got a thought yesterday I was studying on your moment with the King he said she got Esther got to express to the king what her problem was and it granted every request that she had you had your moment when you were pouring out your heart to him but today he hung Haman today he hung Haman he said but in Esther's case that wasn't her deer's need it was to spare her people from a decree that could not be reversed but before that decree could go into effect amen he put another decree in place and it's an Esther 9 thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and Slaughter and destruction and did what they would unto those that hated them I want you to understand brother Ron before the enemy declared decreed over your life cancer there was already in decree and effect I hear Stripes he's healed amen before the enemy try to decrease something over your life there's already something else in effect what you need to do is pick up your sword and go to hammering at that devil saying I'm coming at you in the name of the Lord devil get out of my way this is my inheritance this is my promise you have a need this morning go tell the king you have waited for this moment you have waited for this time you have waited for the

mighty to be praised and the Lord Has Done wonderful things here this morning things that books are written about happen in this room this morning because you laid down the pen and let the author pick it up and let him rewrite your story [Music] story is just beginning [Music] a lot of times people don't understand music in the way that it's played I don't think we're going why in the world is it why is it getting played this way and why is the rhythm going this way every once in a while some of the greatest parts of music is a breath it's the pause and sometimes you wonder why in the world is my story going this way the most powerful moment is the breath and the breath of change has come in this room this morning you are in a season but in a moment the breath changed the entire music sheet the director has come we're going to let you be dismissed today there's still some here that are worshiping the Lord but worship don't just stay here I believe you know that by now but worship don't stay here I was in our car last night we were an hour and a half down the road and it's all of a sudden we just begin to talk about the Lord I've always began to Trail off and I was in another world because I began to worship him as you so I wanted to show you this it doesn't matter where you are in your conversation worship happens wherever so whether it's here at this altar whether it's there in that Pew whether it's in your car whether it's on your job worship is what brings our lord Jesus close what's worship is he thanking him it's praising him for the things that you don't see and the things that you do see and it brings him to the scene so whether you do it here or whether you do it in your car I want you to remain in this type of worship I want you to remain in this moment don't let your conversations break what happened this morning easily so many times we allow just a little little quick changes to come and it breaks it I don't want you to be sincere I want you to be real sincere and I want you to testify to one another if you can do that for me as you're going out today I want you to get to somebody that you wouldn't necessarily talk to or maybe somebody you don't but I want you to testify to them you don't have to give them a whole story but testify to them that the Lord did something for you today can you do that for me today while you're being dismissed that'd be okay I don't make you feel funny does it there's power and testimony so we're going to let you be dismissed just now go in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ come expecting go expecting go believing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Lord bless you and keep you in Jesus name God bless [Music]
