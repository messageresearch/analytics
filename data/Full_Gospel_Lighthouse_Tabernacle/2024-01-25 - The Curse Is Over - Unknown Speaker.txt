[Music] I walk down into a darken pit the trial of my life I fought with all the strength within to keep the faith alive so many nights I lie awake wondering when it all would end reminded of his promises if I would put my trust in him as I reach a place within the F my strength is wearing thin he brings his word so powerful and I find strength again the curse is over faith is won the victory the trial ended hear the shout of victory I know the battle has been hard but what a soldier you are it's all done the battle won the curse is gone as I read the words the joy that FL my soul my heart canot contain all that I feel I Springs of water Welling deep within he reminds me of his promises when I put my trust in him the curse is over and faith is won the victory the trial ended now hear the shout of Victory I know the battle has been hard but what a soldier you are it's all done the battle won the curse is gone you can hear a shout of Praise around the world like a choir sounding Out One Voice the triumph of Our Lord the curse is over and faith is won the victory the trial end now hear the shout of Victory I know the battle has been hard but what a soldier you are it's all done the battle won the curse is gone the curse is over and faith has won the victory the trial ended now here the shout of Victory I know the battle has been hard but what a Soldier you are it's now done the battle won it's now done the battle won it's now done the battle won the curse is gone
