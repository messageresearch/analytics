[1:04:01] express
[1:04:02] the the greatness of god and how much we

[1:06:08] evening i'd like to turn over to matthew
[1:06:10] chapter 1
[1:06:12] and verse 18.
[1:06:21] hey man
[1:06:28] i'd like to uh i'd like to speak to you
[1:06:31] just kind of something that's
[1:06:33] transpired while we were speaking last
[1:06:35] weekend
[1:06:37] on the power of your story and truly i
[1:06:42] i don't think that time would time would
[1:06:45] definitely
[1:06:46] evade us to hear everybody's story here
[1:06:48] but uh
[1:06:50] and there's some stories that don't need
[1:06:52] to be told in public but
[1:06:54] and but we're here
[1:06:58] our story has led us to him
[1:07:01] but i'd like to i'd like to speak to you
[1:07:03] tonight on on more than a story
[1:07:06] it's just more than a story and i i
[1:07:08] believe it
[1:07:09] you'll catch my my vision as we move
[1:07:12] forward but christmas is more than just
[1:07:15] a story
[1:07:17] matthew chapter 1 and verse 18
[1:07:20] now the birth of jesus christ was on
[1:07:22] this wise
[1:07:24] when as his mother mary was espoused to
[1:07:26] joseph before they came together
[1:07:28] she was found with child of the holy
[1:07:30] ghost
[1:07:32] then joseph her husband being a just man
[1:07:35] not willing to make her a public example
[1:07:37] was minded to put her away privately
[1:07:40] but while he thought on these things and
[1:07:43] notice
[1:07:44] those words the prophet would catch that
[1:07:45] and say that's when he comes to us
[1:07:47] is when we think on those things when
[1:07:50] thinking about him that's when he comes
[1:07:51] to us
[1:07:53] and we hold the angel of the lord
[1:07:54] appeared unto him in a dream
[1:07:56] saying joseph thou son of david fear not
[1:08:00] to take unto thee mary thou wife for
[1:08:02] that which is conceived in hers of the
[1:08:04] holy ghost
[1:08:05] and she shall bring forth the son and
[1:08:07] thou shall call his name
[1:08:09] jesus he shall save his people from
[1:08:12] their sins
[1:08:13] now all this was done that it might be
[1:08:15] fulfilled which was spoken of the lord
[1:08:17] by the prophet saying behold a virgin
[1:08:19] shall be with child
[1:08:20] and shall bring forth the son and they
[1:08:22] shall call his name emmanuel
[1:08:25] which being interpreted is god with us
[1:08:28] then joseph being raised from sleep did
[1:08:31] as the angel of the lord had bidden him
[1:08:33] and took unto him his wife and knew her
[1:08:35] not
[1:08:36] she had brought forth her firstborn son
[1:08:39] and he called his name
[1:08:41] jesus may god bless you you may be
[1:08:42] seated this evening in the presence of
[1:08:44] the lord
[1:08:46] also luke chapter 2 and verse 7
[1:08:51] and the bible says and she brought forth
[1:08:53] her firstborn son
[1:08:56] and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[1:08:58] laid him in a manger
[1:09:00] because there was no room for them
[1:09:04] in the end
[1:09:07] i'd say that there's plenty of room here
[1:09:10] for him tonight
[1:09:14] a story is is something that we're all
[1:09:17] very acquainted with
[1:09:19] especially as little children were very
[1:09:21] acquainted with with stories and
[1:09:24] it's a narrative of a true of a either a
[1:09:27] true or a fictitious fact
[1:09:30] and a lot of times we especially
[1:09:33] especially if you live
[1:09:34] close to grottos truth is sometimes
[1:09:37] stranger than fiction
[1:09:41] and there's there's certain people that
[1:09:44] you meet that
[1:09:45] that you hear their story and you think
[1:09:48] can that really be true can the things
[1:09:51] that they're saying
[1:09:52] is is there is there some grounds that
[1:09:54] can be backed up
[1:09:56] by the things that they're saying and
[1:09:59] in this christmas season there are there
[1:10:01] are many stories that are being told and
[1:10:04] and there's many parents that are
[1:10:06] gathering their children and their
[1:10:08] and they're beginning to tell them of
[1:10:09] stories of of sugar plum fairies and
[1:10:12] they're
[1:10:13] they're they're pointing out different
[1:10:14] things throughout the world
[1:10:16] and there's people all around the world
[1:10:18] even in china
[1:10:19] and it's not just in the us but they're
[1:10:21] beginning to tell a story
[1:10:24] about about an overweight man and he's
[1:10:26] he's got a big
[1:10:27] belly and he's and he's and he's jolly
[1:10:30] about life he's got a beard that will
[1:10:32] tickle you if you get close to him and
[1:10:34] and there's a mat this man as he as he
[1:10:37] morphs into this
[1:10:38] into this man that can be around the
[1:10:41] world in a matter of seconds
[1:10:43] people are telling their children about
[1:10:45] this man that gets into a red suit
[1:10:48] that lives far above where anybody in
[1:10:50] the world would ever want to live
[1:10:53] and up there he lives in the north pole
[1:10:55] and they begin to tell this story to
[1:10:57] their children
[1:10:58] from a little bitty age as they they
[1:11:00] begin to tell them about
[1:11:01] santa claus and they begin to tell and
[1:11:03] and they begin to build
[1:11:05] the story of santa claus as it goes on
[1:11:07] that that santa claus lives in the north
[1:11:10] pole where nobody else can see him
[1:11:12] and they're building the story all the
[1:11:14] time and they're telling their children
[1:11:16] that he lives up in the north pole and
[1:11:18] he's
[1:11:19] he's got a bunch of children there in
[1:11:20] the north pole with overgrown ears
[1:11:22] working in a
[1:11:23] sweatshop and they're building toys all
[1:11:26] year long and they're
[1:11:27] they're making these toys and they're
[1:11:29] they're they're building
[1:11:31] things before apple can come out with
[1:11:33] them they're building things before
[1:11:35] before toys r us can come out with them
[1:11:38] they're they're
[1:11:38] building all of these things and parents
[1:11:41] are
[1:11:41] building the hype and they're beginning
[1:11:44] to tell a story
[1:11:45] about a man that is a very fictitious
[1:11:48] man
[1:11:49] but yet if you would see a child if you
[1:11:51] would see a child
[1:11:52] and they've been told that story about
[1:11:55] santa claus
[1:11:56] they would believe that he's real and
[1:11:58] their parents are
[1:12:00] due to this and they're building up a
[1:12:02] hype about a man that drinks coca-cola
[1:12:05] and he likes cookies and he likes milk
[1:12:09] and he likes almost everything that i
[1:12:11] like as well
[1:12:14] and they're building up the hype and
[1:12:16] they're beginning to tell
[1:12:17] they're beginning to tell this story
[1:12:19] about a man that's
[1:12:20] that that at midnight on christmas eve
[1:12:24] as it begins to roll over santa gets his
[1:12:27] santa claus suit on
[1:12:29] he gets everything in order he gets his
[1:12:31] sleigh out and he packs his slave
[1:12:33] with all of these toys and he gets his
[1:12:35] reindeer he gets
[1:12:37] comet and cupid and donner and vincent
[1:12:39] and he gets all of them
[1:12:41] in line and if it's a really cloudy
[1:12:43] night they get rudolph
[1:12:44] out and they put him right in line and
[1:12:47] they begin
[1:12:48] parents begin to tell this story about a
[1:12:50] man
[1:12:51] that's sneaking down your chimney
[1:12:55] why do we tell a story about a breaking
[1:12:58] and entering
[1:13:00] happily about it but we begin to tell
[1:13:04] the story
[1:13:05] about how he slips into your house
[1:13:08] and he begins he's got his red suit on
[1:13:11] and he casts the power of magic to slip
[1:13:14] down a chimney
[1:13:15] and come in there and walk around where
[1:13:18] you wouldn't let nobody else walk around
[1:13:21] and he begins to put out presents and he
[1:13:24] puts out all the things that you asked
[1:13:26] for by a class you wrote it down in a
[1:13:27] letter
[1:13:29] i can tell you one thing i am definitely
[1:13:32] not going to let some fictitious man
[1:13:35] get the credit for me working for my
[1:13:37] children's toys
[1:13:40] for my children's gifts
[1:13:45] and if somebody would tell a little
[1:13:47] child santa claus isn't real
[1:13:50] the parent would cover up the story and
[1:13:53] they would say well they just don't
[1:13:54] believe
[1:13:55] in the christmas magic
[1:13:59] and they begin to tell as as santa claus
[1:14:02] is getting close
[1:14:03] and everything is getting ready and the
[1:14:05] parents begin to tell the story and
[1:14:07] build up the story
[1:14:09] and maybe the night before christmas
[1:14:12] they'll read
[1:14:13] it was the night before christmas when
[1:14:15] all through the house not a creature was
[1:14:17] touring not even a mouse
[1:14:20] the stockings were hung by the chimney
[1:14:21] with care and hopes that saint nicholas
[1:14:24] would soon be there and all of this
[1:14:28] is just a story all of this is just
[1:14:31] made up in the imagination of mankind
[1:14:34] where they built up
[1:14:36] where saint nicholas was a man that went
[1:14:38] around and did about good
[1:14:40] but could i tell you about another night
[1:14:42] before christmas
[1:14:44] about a god that's real about a god that
[1:14:47] wants to enter not just your house but
[1:14:49] he wants to enter your heart
[1:14:51] he don't want to just enter your heart
[1:14:52] he wants into your mind he wants to come
[1:14:54] into your life
[1:14:56] and because of a christmas 2000 years
[1:14:59] ago

[1:15:01] christmas not
[1:15:03] just on the 25th day of december but you
[1:15:06] can have christmas every single day of
[1:15:08] your life
[1:15:09] he don't want to be just born in a
[1:15:11] manger he wants to be born in your heart
[1:15:13] he don't want to be just born in hay he
[1:15:15] wants to be born in your life
[1:15:18] so let me tell you about another night
[1:15:20] before christmas
[1:15:22] it was the night before christmas and
[1:15:24] all through the land
[1:15:26] people were traveling to their homeland
[1:15:28] the ends were full of travelers you know
[1:15:30] and a young couple was searching for
[1:15:32] some place to go
[1:15:34] she was heavy with child and found
[1:15:35] permission to rest
[1:15:37] in a small stable not considered the
[1:15:39] best
[1:15:40] it had a manger in hay and not much more
[1:15:43] just a few animals and a dirt floor
[1:15:45] in the same country abiding in the field
[1:15:48] shepherds were tending their sheep as
[1:15:49] they will
[1:15:50] the stars up above were shining up high
[1:15:53] one in particular was lighting the sky
[1:15:56] all of a sudden there appeared in the
[1:15:58] sky the angel of god with a message from
[1:16:00] on high
[1:16:01] the angel pronounced don't be afraid i
[1:16:04] bring you good tidings for all people
[1:16:06] today a savior is born to you this day
[1:16:08] which is christ the lord
[1:16:10] he had to say in the city of david
[1:16:13] wrapped in old clothes
[1:16:14] lying in a manger is the sign you should
[1:16:16] know and all of a sudden there was a
[1:16:18] singing in the air
[1:16:20] a multitude of angels singing with care
[1:16:23] glory to god in the highest and on earth
[1:16:25] peace and good will towards men
[1:16:27] and when they were gone the shepherds
[1:16:29] agreed that they would travel to
[1:16:31] bethlehem immediately
[1:16:33] and when they arrived they found the
[1:16:35] sign mary
[1:16:36] joseph and the baby he was lying in the
[1:16:38] manger just as the angel proclaimed
[1:16:41] they told their parents that they were
[1:16:43] told of this holy child
[1:16:44] that she now holds and mary was thinking
[1:16:47] of the things that they had said
[1:16:49] then they returned and they bowed their
[1:16:51] heads they praised and they prayed and
[1:16:54] glorified him
[1:16:55] for all the things that the angels had
[1:16:57] said and eight days later when it was
[1:16:59] time the small child jesus was named
[1:17:02] remember the star that lighted the sky
[1:17:05] the special night the angels came by
[1:17:07] from even that time from really afar
[1:17:10] they'd been three kings that been
[1:17:12] following that star
[1:17:13] it taken much time to follow the star
[1:17:15] but they
[1:17:16] but they rejoice with great joy when
[1:17:19] they saw what they saw
[1:17:20] a mother named mary with a child that
[1:17:22] they saw
[1:17:23] they fell to the floor and worshiped
[1:17:25] with all they brought
[1:17:27] him gifts of myrrh and frankincense of
[1:17:29] gold very pricey items i am told
[1:17:32] over 2 000 years have passed since then
[1:17:35] when jesus was a child
[1:17:37] born not of sin he came and he lived and
[1:17:40] he died for us
[1:17:41] god almighty he really loves us he will
[1:17:44] be back very soon indeed
[1:17:46] to gather his bride for a wedding feast
[1:17:49] christmas will continue forever indeed
[1:17:52] so give your gifts in his memory merry
[1:17:55] christmas to all
[1:17:56] and to all a good night may your life be
[1:17:59] filled with his joy

[1:18:08] of every person that has came here now
[1:18:11] whether they accept it or not or whether
[1:18:13] they believe it or not

[1:18:19] it's more than just another baby that
[1:18:21] was born on a starry night
[1:18:23] it's more than a little mother that had
[1:18:25] got pregnant at 16 years old it's more
[1:18:28] than that story
[1:18:29] behind this story is the author of peace
[1:18:32] he's not the author of confusion but the
[1:18:35] one that is writing this story
[1:18:37] is the author of life he's the author of
[1:18:40] eternal salvation
[1:18:42] he is the author and the finisher of our
[1:18:45] faith
[1:18:45] and when he writes a story it's more
[1:18:49] than just
[1:18:49] a story i know that i'm dealing with a
[1:18:54] dealing with a mixed crowd here and
[1:18:56] understanding that some people don't
[1:18:57] under

[1:19:13] usa
[1:19:13] is the library of congress holding over
[1:19:16] 170 million books
[1:19:18] there in the library of congress but
[1:19:21] could you imagine
[1:19:22] as you're walking through there and
[1:19:24] every single one of those books that are
[1:19:26] lined out
[1:19:26] every one of them have a story behind it
[1:19:29] every one of them
[1:19:30] represents certain things or maybe
[1:19:33] history or
[1:19:34] maybe different public things that had
[1:19:36] happened or transpired
[1:19:37] and they're all written by an author but
[1:19:40] there is not
[1:19:40] one book in the in the library of
[1:19:44] congress

[1:20:36] side of the room
[1:20:37] but this book was written by 40 writers
[1:20:40] that were inspired by the holy ghost

[1:22:18] cast the first stone
[1:22:20] there were people thought they knew what

[1:29:40] it wouldn't rain for three and a half
[1:29:42] years
[1:29:43] he was a man he was a man that was moody

[1:29:53] would devour children
[1:29:55] he was a man that had the power of
[1:29:59] fire that when he went to a showdown
[1:30:02] between god and baal
[1:30:04] and it would put to them a showdown
[1:30:05] which god will you serve
[1:30:07] god or baal and he said let the god that
[1:30:11] answers fire fire by fire let him be god
[1:30:16] this is more than a story this is more
[1:30:20] than just somebody making this
[1:30:22] up this is about men
[1:30:26] and women just like yourself going
[1:30:29] through life
[1:30:30] they didn't have a guidebook noah didn't
[1:30:32] have a god book
[1:30:33] moses didn't have a god book what to go
[1:30:36] by what to say what not to say
[1:30:38] it showed all of his humanity and it
[1:30:41] showed all of elijah's humanity
[1:30:43] the book showed all of those things
[1:30:46] it showed that they were men that were
[1:30:49] troubled
[1:30:50] by this little thing
[1:30:53] that's controlled by five senses that
[1:30:56] you have so much trouble with
[1:30:59] they were troubled by the flesh they
[1:31:01] were troubled by their emotion
[1:31:03] they were troubled in their spirit
[1:31:07] but what is god doing he's not just
[1:31:10] making up stories
[1:31:12] he's showing his artwork
[1:31:18] a man named elijah
[1:31:21] that could call fire down from heaven
[1:31:24] people would watch as he would take 12
[1:31:27] barrels
[1:31:28] of water and poured on a sacrifice and
[1:31:31] all of a sudden
[1:31:32] the fire of god would come down and
[1:31:34] consume that sacrifice
[1:31:37] but that man would get so weak
[1:31:41] under the anointing that he would have
[1:31:43] to send his servant
[1:31:45] to go climb a hill it showed
[1:31:48] that even when you feel like you can't
[1:31:50] go god's getting ready to send you in a
[1:31:53] refreshing
[1:31:54] he got so weak in his in his flesh that
[1:31:58] he had to send his own servant go up and
[1:32:00] see if there'd be any clouds
[1:32:02] and he sent ahab back down to his
[1:32:05] kingdom
[1:32:05] and told him to get ready i hear the
[1:32:09] abundance of rain
[1:32:10] coming before elijah ever seen that
[1:32:13] cloud
[1:32:14] he began to testify of what was coming
[1:32:17] [Applause]
[1:32:19] here was a man that was so weak that he
[1:32:21] couldn't even climb a hill
[1:32:23] but when the refreshing of the lord came
[1:32:25] upon him
[1:32:26] he outran ahab's fastest chariots
[1:32:30] 17 miles back to a kingdom because it's
[1:32:33] more than a story
[1:32:34] there's a god that's behind the
[1:32:36] characters of the book
[1:32:38] and if you could realize tonight that
[1:32:41] your life is just more than your life
[1:32:44] it's his life it's his story

[1:32:49] feel like he can't go on
[1:32:51] he gives you a perseverance and say
[1:32:53] you're not
[1:32:54] giving up i built you for greatness i
[1:32:57] didn't build you for defeat
[1:32:59] i built you for victory
[1:33:13] it's more than a story
[1:33:18] santa claus is a story
[1:33:21] the easter rabbit it's a story
[1:33:28] but this god is not just
[1:33:34] a fictitious god he's a god that can be
[1:33:38] handled
[1:33:39] he's a god that can be touched
[1:33:45] he's a god that he wants you to
[1:33:48] experience him
[1:33:53] it's more than just reading this book

[1:34:26] school one day
[1:34:29] and all he had plans to do that day was
[1:34:31] take his lunch with him and skip school
[1:34:36] because he had heard about a man that
[1:34:38] was telling stories
[1:34:41] but there was something different about
[1:34:43] this man
[1:34:44] but little did this boy know that he
[1:34:47] would play a part
[1:34:48] in one of the greatest stories that

[1:35:01] writes
[1:35:02] these stories the god that makes
[1:35:04] characters
[1:35:05] to step out of position of going to
[1:35:08] school
[1:35:09] to make them go and listen to a man that
[1:35:12] he was healing the sick
[1:35:13] he was teaching them on the hill he was
[1:35:16] telling them about a god that was real
[1:35:22] he would be the god
[1:35:30] he would be a god that would tell you
[1:35:32] all you got to do is write a check
[1:35:37] that you're more than just a girl
[1:35:41] you're my wife
[1:35:46] and you may feel like you ain't brought
[1:35:48] much you may feel like you ain't brought
[1:35:50] much to the meeting
[1:35:52] but what you got for people that have
[1:35:55] despised the day of small things what
[1:35:57] you got
[1:35:58] is everything i need hallelujah
[1:36:02] everything you've got is all that i need
[1:36:05] oh you say well i ain't got very much
[1:36:07] this little boy all he had
[1:36:09] was two loaves of bread and five fishes
[1:36:12] but when god put his hand on it
[1:36:14] there was people that had despised a
[1:36:16] small thing but when god went to
[1:36:18] blessing
[1:36:19] he was showing that he was the same god
[1:36:21] that rained down
[1:36:22] manna for the children of israel and he
[1:36:25] was the same god
[1:36:27] that could take these fishes and these
[1:36:29] loaves
[1:36:30] and he could bless and feed 5000 and
[1:36:33] they would take up 12 baskets full
[1:36:36] you may feel like you ain't got much to
[1:36:38] offer but god
[1:36:39] all he wants is your heart
[1:36:46] hallelujah all jesus was born in was a
[1:36:49] stable
[1:36:50] but it was enough
[1:36:53] he don't need a pink decorated bed a
[1:36:56] hospital room or
[1:36:57] a blue decorated hospital room he just
[1:37:00] wants your heart
[1:37:03] oh hallelujah
[1:37:10] this god will tell you
[1:37:16] about the greatest stories that has
[1:37:18] spanned
[1:37:19] humanity these stories that we read to
[1:37:23] you
[1:37:24] time in and time out over and over again
[1:37:30] we're not just trying to get you to a
[1:37:31] certain point
[1:37:33] we're not trying to just preach to you
[1:37:35] about elijah
[1:37:36] or preach to you about david or preach
[1:37:38] to you about noah
[1:37:40] we're not just trying to get you to a
[1:37:42] point we're trying to get you to a life
[1:37:47] you heard me from this pulpit a few
[1:37:48] weeks ago when i stood here and i
[1:37:50] i proclaimed something that was on my
[1:37:52] heart god i want it more than just a
[1:37:54] sermon
[1:37:55] and god's given me something lord
[1:37:57] willing i'll give it to you in the next
[1:37:58] couple of weeks
[1:37:59] lord it's more than stories
[1:38:03] it's more than sermons it's more than
[1:38:06] just a preacher
[1:38:07] it's more than just a church building
[1:38:09] it's more than just people
[1:38:11] there is a god that's behind all of
[1:38:15] these stories
[1:38:16] that's behind all of these characters
[1:38:18] and he's trying to work his way into
[1:38:21] your thinking
[1:38:22] and into your life that you would say
[1:38:24] let this
[1:38:25] mind be in you which was also in christ
[1:38:28] jesus
[1:38:30] i can point you to the life that i once
[1:38:32] lived but the life that i now live
[1:38:35] i can tell you about a god that would
[1:38:37] show up and he would follow the children
[1:38:39] of israel
[1:38:40] by the pill of fire and a pillar of
[1:38:41] cloud but i'm not
[1:38:44] just telling about that of 2000 years
[1:38:46] ago
[1:38:47] or 6 000 years ago but i want to tell
[1:38:50] you church of the living god
[1:38:52] it's thus saith the lord the pillar fire
[1:38:54] is
[1:38:55] here in this building it's more than a
[1:38:58] story that we can make up in our mind
[1:39:00] he's here
[1:39:05] he's here
[1:39:10] hallelujah you're more than just another
[1:39:12] girl
[1:39:16] you're more than just a part of the
[1:39:17] crowd
[1:39:20] you're the queen of heaven
[1:39:26] it's more than just a little girl
[1:39:30] that had heard about a prophet
[1:39:33] that 800 years before she would step
[1:39:36] into role
[1:39:42] i would say behold a virgin shall
[1:39:45] conceive
[1:39:48] she was made up of the same 16 elements
[1:39:51] like you are her mother ate her body out
[1:39:55] of the ground
[1:39:56] just like your mother ate her atrial
[1:39:58] body out of the ground
[1:40:01] but this little girl 16 years old
[1:40:07] it was more than just a story to her
[1:40:12] because her and joseph had been
[1:40:13] communing on this thought
[1:40:17] i wonder i wonder when we'll see that i
[1:40:22] wonder when we'll see this transpire
[1:40:25] could it be a maiden in the land today
[1:40:27] or is it for a time on
[1:40:30] there's something pushing
[1:40:33] there's prophecy behind this
[1:40:37] and she's walking down a road
[1:40:41] she's walking down the road from the
[1:40:43] meanest city that there is
[1:40:46] nazareth she's from a town
[1:40:50] that nobody wanted to be from even
[1:40:53] nathanael would say
[1:40:55] can any good thing come out of nazareth
[1:40:59] it was the meanest city that there was
[1:41:01] but it was a city
[1:41:04] that god himself wanted to be birthed
[1:41:07] from
[1:41:10] hallelujah and this little girl takes a
[1:41:13] walk
[1:41:14] going out it's more than just
[1:41:18] seeing a light and talking and commuting
[1:41:22] and thinking on these things
[1:41:25] and she's walking and making her way and
[1:41:27] she sees a light
[1:41:29] and out of that light steps a six foot
[1:41:31] being
[1:41:32] and he begins to tell her mary thou art
[1:41:35] highly favored
[1:41:41] let me drop this to you why is this girl
[1:41:46] so focused on saying that she met an
[1:41:49] angel
[1:41:51] why is she so driven to say that she had
[1:41:55] a meeting with an angel
[1:41:56] that says that i'm the one when
[1:41:59] everybody
[1:42:00] else around her would criticize her and
[1:42:02] say
[1:42:03] that can't be that's for a day coming or
[1:42:06] a day gone by
[1:42:08] why is she so driven why is she so
[1:42:11] adamant
[1:42:12] on saying that she met this met this
[1:42:15] angel
[1:42:16] that he had an olive complexion had hair
[1:42:18] down to his shoulders
[1:42:20] and he stood there he had deep set eyes
[1:42:23] and as i looked at him
[1:42:24] it looked like he was looking through me
[1:42:28] why is this girl so driven to say that
[1:42:32] she was the one that met that angel
[1:42:35] let me bring it up to you why is a man
[1:42:37] by the name of william branham
[1:42:39] so driven so perseverant that he would
[1:42:42] stand in
[1:42:43] faces of thousands of the greatest of
[1:42:45] the who's whose
[1:42:46] and said i had a meeting with an angel
[1:42:49] on the backside of a cave
[1:42:51] and he told me that if i would get the
[1:42:53] people to believe my prayer
[1:42:55] not even cancer would stand before me
[1:42:59] it's more than just a story of an angel
[1:43:04] it's god working in his redemption plan
[1:43:08] getting to his children he said well i
[1:43:12] don't necessarily believe about mary met
[1:43:14] an angel
[1:43:15] i do because i met him
[1:43:19] i'm a witness i have met him
[1:43:22] and when joseph is visited by an angel
[1:43:26] in a secondary way by the way of a dream
[1:43:32] what does the angel do he confirms
[1:43:36] mary's testimony
[1:43:44] the things that had been spoken
[1:43:48] the things that had been uttered by
[1:43:51] human voice
[1:43:53] joseph i know you may not understand
[1:43:57] this
[1:43:59] but i'm with child
[1:44:02] oh hallelujah there be one person that
[1:44:07] would say i'm pregnant with this word
[1:44:10] hallelujah mary would say joseph
[1:44:14] i know you're a just man and i know
[1:44:16] you'll do the right thing but i
[1:44:19] i have met an angel and he has deposited
[1:44:22] something on the inside of me and i am
[1:44:25] telling you
[1:44:26] that what that is inside of me has been
[1:44:29] conceived of the holy ghost
[1:44:31] she was speaking what the angel said
[1:44:36] and the angel came and confirmed what
[1:44:39] mary had said
[1:44:40] hallelujah brother branham spoke it and
[1:44:43] the angel has come in this service
[1:44:46] to confirm the testimony that there will
[1:44:49] be a bride
[1:44:50] without spot without wrinkle she's dread
[1:44:54] she's dressed
[1:44:55] she's ready it's more than a story
[1:44:58] you're the people of the story
[1:45:02] you are the redeemed
[1:45:04] [Applause]
[1:45:06] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:45:15] and he's watched over your life
[1:45:19] throughout your humanity he's watched
[1:45:21] over your life
[1:45:23] and you look at your your great span of
[1:45:27] time
[1:45:29] and you look at all the mistakes
[1:45:34] it's real easy it's real easy to flip
[1:45:38] through this book
[1:45:40] and find where sarah lied
[1:45:44] it'd be real easy to flip through your
[1:45:46] life and find
[1:45:47] all the mistakes
[1:45:50] could we be honest it'd be real easy you
[1:45:53] wouldn't have to do no background check
[1:45:54] on us
[1:45:55] we're just human enough to tell you
[1:45:57] there's mistakes in our past
[1:46:01] you ain't gotta search very deep you
[1:46:04] ain't gotta search very far
[1:46:09] hallelujah you're a people
[1:46:12] you're a people that came here broken up
[1:46:14] you're a people that came here
[1:46:16] and it doesn't take much to look through
[1:46:18] your life and find that there was faults
[1:46:20] and found that there was failures i told
[1:46:22] you that god didn't hide those things
[1:46:24] but when you get on the other side of
[1:46:26] the blood
[1:46:28] there's not one mistake on your life
[1:46:32] he don't see you in prison he don't see
[1:46:34] you in chains
[1:46:35] he don't see you with anxiety he don't
[1:46:37] see you with fear
[1:46:39] he don't see you in baby trouble he
[1:46:41] don't see you with cancer
[1:46:42] he sees you complete
[1:46:52] it's more than a story redemption is at
[1:46:55] work
[1:46:59] why would god take all of these
[1:47:01] characters
[1:47:05] there's a lot of characters that maybe
[1:47:07] you can't identify with
[1:47:11] i'd say 90 percent of you
[1:47:16] and there's nothing wrong in this
[1:47:17] there's 90 percent of you that probably
[1:47:19] have never seen the pillar of fire
[1:47:24] but i'd say there's maybe i'll just say
[1:47:28] maybe
[1:47:28] let this be prophecy but i'd say there's
[1:47:30] a hundred percent of you that have
[1:47:32] experienced that pillar of fire
[1:47:41] there's a lot of characters that you you
[1:47:43] read through the bible
[1:47:46] and you read through there and you think
[1:47:48] i didn't get
[1:47:49] nothing from that i can't identify
[1:47:52] whatsoever
[1:47:54] but there might be a brother or a sister
[1:47:56] that's sitting here
[1:47:58] that person has got my name identified
[1:48:02] to him
[1:48:05] i'd say there's a lot of men that are
[1:48:07] sitting here that could identify with
[1:48:09] simon peter
[1:48:10] that you'd be the kind of guy that if
[1:48:12] somebody stood up against your pastor
[1:48:14] you'd stand up with more than a sword
[1:48:18] you'd stand up with brass knuckles and
[1:48:19] maybe something else
[1:48:22] you could identify with it but peter
[1:48:25] on the other side of pentecost was a
[1:48:27] liar
[1:48:28] on the other side of pentecost he was he
[1:48:32] said things that wasn't right he'd done
[1:48:34] things that wasn't right
[1:48:35] but just hallelujah just
[1:48:38] more than 50 days from this spot where
[1:48:41] he's a deceiver
[1:48:42] where he mocks god way where he won't be
[1:48:44] identified with this jesus
[1:48:46] 50 days from now somebody might be
[1:48:49] sitting here and they may not look like
[1:48:51] the picture
[1:48:52] that god has planted but just give them
[1:48:54] 50 days maybe
[1:48:56] give them on the other side of pentecost
[1:49:00] if you only knew my story
[1:49:04] it's more than a story of andrew spencer
[1:49:07] it's the blood of the lamb it's about
[1:49:10] the power of pentecost
[1:49:12] i can tell you about a fire that came
[1:49:14] down on the day of pentecost
[1:49:15] 2 000 years ago and filled 120 vessels
[1:49:19] in an upper room and came out shouting
[1:49:21] and praising god everywhere
[1:49:23] but i don't want to just tell you about
[1:49:24] a god of history let me tell you about a
[1:49:27] god of
[1:49:27] his story he's the same yesterday
[1:49:30] today and forever it's more than a story
[1:49:34] that you can receive the baptism of the
[1:49:36] holy ghost
[1:49:37] you can have it right now sitting in
[1:49:39] your pew
[1:49:40] where you're at wash
[1:49:43] made new it's more than a story
[1:49:48] it's his story
[1:49:53] i don't have control over your life and
[1:49:55] i don't have control over your story
[1:49:58] but i'm here representing the one that
[1:50:00] does
[1:50:03] and you look at your life and you think
[1:50:06] my goodness
[1:50:07] here is my life and it's identified
[1:50:12] it's identified as man i had some great
[1:50:15] mountain tops
[1:50:17] then i had some great valleys man it was
[1:50:20] dark
[1:50:22] and it seemed like when the sun was with
[1:50:24] china i only seen it for 20 minutes a
[1:50:25] day
[1:50:27] but then all of a sudden you you look at
[1:50:30] your life and
[1:50:31] you look and you think i'm
[1:50:34] coming up
[1:50:38] on the roadside
[1:50:41] of a mountain
[1:50:45] and i'm doing my best to make it
[1:50:50] in and you climb on up that mountain
[1:50:54] then all of a sudden god will give you
[1:50:55] another another valley
[1:50:58] but when you're walking down in that
[1:51:00] valley you say hey
[1:51:01] i can point back to my mountaintop
[1:51:03] experiences hey
[1:51:05] i remember what it was like to stand up
[1:51:08] there
[1:51:09] i heard a prophet tell me if you stay
[1:51:12] too much on the mountain your fruits
[1:51:13] will freeze
[1:51:14] but if you get down in the valley that's
[1:51:16] where they flourish at
[1:51:19] you wouldn't understand the sunshine if
[1:51:22] you didn't have some rain
[1:51:26] you wouldn't understand the good times
[1:51:28] if you didn't have some bad times
[1:51:30] you wouldn't understand health if you
[1:51:32] didn't have some sicknesses
[1:51:34] you wouldn't understand freedom if you
[1:51:37] didn't have some bondage
[1:51:41] hallelujah
[1:51:42] [Applause]
[1:51:46] hallelujah
[1:51:48] hallelujah why can i dance why can i
[1:51:52] sing
[1:51:53] why can i preach i know what it's like i
[1:51:56] know what it's like for satan to put his
[1:51:58] hands on my feet
[1:51:59] and say you're not going to dance but
[1:52:01] what did i do i kept on dancing
[1:52:05] i know what it's like to be bound up in
[1:52:08] sin
[1:52:08] bound up with drugs bound up with
[1:52:10] alcohol
[1:52:11] but i can tell you about a god
[1:52:15] i can tell you about a god that can save
[1:52:18] and a god that can deliver
[1:52:20] i want to tell you he's ever present

[1:52:42] from laodicea because it's more than
[1:52:45] just a story
[1:52:55] he watched you all your life
[1:53:03] hallelujah when you were getting ready

[1:53:08] he'd come and grab the towel out of your
[1:53:10] hand

[1:53:16] spot where you say
[1:53:18] i ain't got enough money to put food on
[1:53:20] my table

[1:55:14] he was destined to die
[1:55:17] but more than die he was testing to rise
[1:55:19] again
[1:55:21] it's more than a story that you read
[1:55:24] over in the book of luke
[1:55:25] and talking about two men that were
[1:55:27] walking down a road and they were
[1:55:29] talking about the messiah
[1:55:31] and all of a sudden the messiah came
[1:55:33] close to them because they were talking
[1:55:35] about him
[1:55:37] he was more than just another man that
[1:55:39] identified himself with them
[1:55:41] this was the man that had wrote the book
[1:55:44] and nothing had happened to him that he
[1:55:46] didn't know was going to happen to him
[1:55:48] but he drew near as they began to walk
[1:55:52] he drew near and he took him from
[1:55:55] general genesis to revelation
[1:55:57] kind of like i've done with you this
[1:55:58] evening he took you from the front of
[1:56:00] the book
[1:56:01] to the back of the book and when it got
[1:56:03] to a spot
[1:56:04] when it looked like the preacher was
[1:56:05] getting ready to close and the stories
[1:56:07] were done getting told
[1:56:09] there was two people that pulled on him
[1:56:13] and said why don't you come on in the
[1:56:15] inside with us
[1:56:18] he said you know what i believe i will
[1:56:20] since you pulled so hard
[1:56:22] i'll let the bethlehem that i am come on
[1:56:24] the inside of you
[1:56:28] hallelujah and you'll watch me do
[1:56:31] something
[1:56:31] you won't know it's me until i do what
[1:56:34] i'm gonna do
[1:56:36] and when i do what i'm gonna do you'll
[1:56:38] know that it's me
[1:56:44] now you're looking and you see just
[1:56:46] andrew you're looking and you just see
[1:56:48] ron
[1:56:48] but when you see him do what he's about
[1:56:50] to do
[1:56:51] when he works that miracle and he breaks
[1:56:54] the bread of life he'll say that wasn't
[1:56:56] andrew
[1:56:57] that's him that's him that's him
[1:57:01] when i see those prodigals coming back i
[1:57:04] say it's more than a story
[1:57:07] when i see my loved ones that i got
[1:57:09] prayer cloths laying all over their
[1:57:11] houses
[1:57:11] i'll say that was him that was him
[1:57:16] this is more than fiction this is
[1:57:22] christmas
[1:57:27] let's stand
[1:57:31] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:57:37] hallelujah
[1:57:40] hallelujah it's more than just a manger
[1:57:46] it's more than just hay it's more than
[1:57:48] just a virgin birth
[1:57:52] about you being in bethlehem
[1:57:55] but he would choose a little place
[1:57:57] called bethlehem
[1:57:58] and the prophet would say that all sons
[1:58:01] and daughters of god
[1:58:02] that are living real believers are
[1:58:04] bethlehem
[1:58:06] you're the house of god's bread
[1:58:14] it's more it's more
[1:58:18] it's more than you could ever imagine
[1:58:21] it's more stories than i could ever tell
[1:58:24] it's a true story
[1:58:30] that could point you out to the stable
[1:58:31] that he was born at
[1:58:33] they could take you to a spot where they
[1:58:36] said the inn keeper would say there's no
[1:58:37] room
[1:58:41] this is where it happened at
[1:58:44] but right here in this service there
[1:58:46] have been people
[1:58:48] when they looked on this rejected christ
[1:58:51] and they seen where other people
[1:58:52] wouldn't let him in
[1:58:53] they say you could come in here you can
[1:58:56] be born right here
[1:58:59] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:59:03] this is more than just another service
[1:59:06] this is more than just me telling
[1:59:07] stories about bay
[1:59:08] about bibles and stories of days of old
[1:59:11] this is more than that
[1:59:13] this has been him standing here you've
[1:59:16] been spiritual enough to receive it
[1:59:17] you've seen it's him
[1:59:20] it's not christ of days old it's christ
[1:59:23] in you the hope of glory
[1:59:25] it's the son of man still walking
