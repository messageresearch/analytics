[26:46] you know after that night or after that
[26:48] morning I I haven't felt that condition
[26:51] that I had before and no matter what the
[26:53] doctors are saying or no matter what
[26:55] they may even have planned ahead you can
[26:58] look back and we can look back and say
[26:59] the Lord came by my way and he touched
[27:02] me it may not be a lightning strike it
[27:05] may not be anything that we feel even
[27:07] just now but Lord Jesus it is a faith
[27:09] that we have that that one of these days
[27:11] we will all be Lord and we're just
[27:13] believing in that balm of Gilead that
[27:15] you could come down and you could wipe
[27:17] just across this and and you could heal
[27:18] us of every condition that we are
[27:20] fighting but Lord Jesus more importantly
[27:22] I I'm believing in a in an Assad that
[27:25] you could place a spiritualized salve
[27:27] that you could place upon the people
[27:28] that if they don't see your word if
[27:30] you're if your word has not been
[27:31] revealed unto them Lord Jesus I believe
[27:34] that you could come just across them
[27:35] just now and you could close off those
[27:38] channels that Satan has tried to tried
[27:40] to open up and send his word to their
[27:42] ear that they would listen to listen to
[27:44] the things of the world and he would try
[27:46] to draw them in closer to to the the
[27:48] witnessing that he has done to the world
[27:50] already you would close off those
[27:51] channels and open up the channel ways
[27:53] that that would come from you that would
[27:56] come from you that you could reveal the
[27:57] word unto them and reveal that the true
[27:59] word of God and not not some tainted
[28:01] word not some word that that men have
[28:03] been able to taint and put their own
[28:05] man's idea of of how to do this or how
[28:07] to do that allow us to be able to come
[28:09] and just worship freely we thank you for
[28:11] for bringing making the change we thank

[43:53] going through a time but you know God
[43:55] knows all about it and it's in these
[43:57] kind of moments you remember that man
[43:59] that had the dream about the only one
[44:01] set of footprints in the sand
[44:03] these are the moments that he's carrying
[44:05] Brother Andy when you go through these
[44:07] moments and it may not be cancer it may
[44:09] be just the darkest Valley that you've
[44:11] ever had but it's in those moments that
[44:13] he's carrying you amen God bless you if
[44:16] you'll turn with me to Matthew chapter
[44:17] 13.
[44:19] and also Luke chapter 14 Matthew chapter
[44:21] 13 verse 44 will begin
[44:31] Matthew 13 44 and then Luke 14 verse 27.
[44:37] the Bible said Jesus speaking here and
[44:40] again the kingdom of heaven
[44:43] is likened to treasure hid in a field
[44:46] that which when a man hath found he
[44:49] hideth and for Joy therefore goeth and
[44:52] selleth all that he hath
[44:55] and buyeth that field
[44:57] again the Kingdom of Heaven is likened
[44:59] to a merchant man seeking goodly pearls
[45:01] who when he had found one Pearl of great
[45:06] price went and sold all that he had
[45:11] and bought it
[45:12] in Luke chapter 14
[45:14] verse 27 and whosoever doth not bear his
[45:18] cross and come after me cannot be my
[45:21] disciple
[45:22] for which of you intending to build a
[45:24] tower sitteth not down first and
[45:27] counteth the cost
[45:29] whether he have sufficient to finish it
[45:31] lest happily after he hath laid the
[45:33] foundation is not able to finish it all
[45:36] that behold it begin to mock him saying
[45:38] this man begin to build and was not able

[46:44] Christ's name amen amen God bless you as
[46:46] you're seated
[46:47] with the help of the Lord this evening
[46:49] I'd like to speak to title this count
[46:52] the cost
[46:54] count the cost you know brother Braham
[46:55] tells us that he's made the statements
[46:57] before he said if I had the literal
[46:59] blood of Jesus in a charger or if he had
[47:02] it in a little bottle and it was the
[47:04] literal blood of Jesus how careful
[47:07] would he be and how he would just weep
[47:09] over the literal blood to think that
[47:11] this Blood Brother Stephen is a very
[47:13] blood that Set Me Free this blood is
[47:16] what healed me this blood is what
[47:17] cleansed me and he would take so such
[47:20] great care to not drop it or or to not
[47:22] break it or spill it in some way but he
[47:24] said how much greater is the purchase of
[47:27] that blood
[47:29] how much greater are the people that
[47:31] have actually been called out by that
[47:33] blood because we know that the physical
[47:35] ailments of the blood are gone but yet
[47:37] the effects are ongoing here we are over
[47:40] 2 000 years later
[47:42] and we're still being healed and
[47:45] delivered and filled with the Holy Ghost
[47:46] because that blood was shed
[47:50] now it's important in life Jesus
[47:51] speaking here in our text about how
[47:53] important it is to count the cost and he
[47:56] goes into the natural because we
[47:57] understand spiritual things by natural
[47:59] occurrences so he goes into the natural
[48:02] and he begins you know when you even
[48:03] study out history you'll find that many
[48:05] generals they were trying to maneuver
[48:07] and they would figure out how could they
[48:09] defeat the enemy they would have before
[48:10] they would meet the enemy in battle
[48:13] they would have to be certain that there
[48:15] was a good chance
[48:17] that they could win
[48:18] because they had the they had the blood
[48:20] of of men on their hands and when they
[48:22] would make mistakes that would be fatal
[48:24] so it's important that the cost would be
[48:27] counted and he said that when a person
[48:29] finds something of such value they
[48:32] realize that Pearl is of such value
[48:34] they're willing to give up everything
[48:35] else to get this one single Pearl maybe
[48:39] they found it on a certain piece of
[48:40] property and and people can't understand
[48:42] why they're willing why are why are they
[48:44] paying so much for it but there is a
[48:47] hidden value in there that only the
[48:50] person that discovered it is is aware of
[48:52] and they're willing to sell it all
[48:55] to get that property
[48:57] to get that Pearl that hidden treasure
[49:01] that's beneath the Earth
[49:03] now in this world we live in we all have
[49:06] to deal with finances and jobs and bills
[49:08] and we all have bills and we've got to
[49:10] figure out in a lot certain budgets and
[49:13] you know that's the problem that's what
[49:15] a lot of times you know what happens
[49:16] with with world economies is that people
[49:18] start spending more than they're getting
[49:21] in and they're not counting the cost of
[49:24] if I can't afford this now I'm not here
[49:27] to preach finances to you but there's a
[49:29] spiritual parallel of the natural versus
[49:33] the spiritual
[49:35] and that's what's wrong with our
[49:36] generation is that when something is
[49:38] always I'm not talking about gifts but
[49:41] when someone has a lifestyle just gets
[49:43] things handed to them that never
[49:45] appreciate it because it didn't cost
[49:48] them anything
[49:49] so the first time they may be a preach
[49:51] though they appreciate and then the
[49:52] second time they appreciate a little
[49:53] less and the next time and the
[49:55] appreciation wears off and then they
[49:57] begin to look for what we call handouts
[50:01] and you can't get them to go back to
[50:02] work
[50:04] you see because they they never worked
[50:08] for it
[50:09] and they don't appreciate the value of
[50:11] it
[50:13] we look in the scriptures and it's a
[50:15] spiritual strain
[50:17] in the scriptures that we're going to
[50:19] look and follow and we know that Abraham
[50:21] and and we all know the story of Abraham
[50:23] there and whenever Sarah after God
[50:25] changed him back young again eventually
[50:27] they had to die again
[50:29] so when Sarah died she he wanted a
[50:32] special place to bury her so he went and
[50:35] you can find that when you can read it
[50:36] when you go home but in Genesis 23 for
[50:38] the sake of time we'll just keep going
[50:39] but he goes and he approaches the sons
[50:41] of Heth and he's asking about where that
[50:44] he would like to bury his wife here and
[50:46] them men are trying to give that
[50:49] Property Brother Fred to Abraham
[50:52] for free
[50:54] now who doesn't love free property
[50:58] but yet this was something so much more
[51:00] than just in the natural temporal once
[51:02] Abraham was gone the land would end up
[51:04] being taken this was a spiritual strain
[51:06] within Father Abraham that he had
[51:08] because God knew that thousands of years
[51:11] later
[51:12] that that that would be the promised
[51:15] land and that's where he would become
[51:16] manifest in flesh and that is where that
[51:18] Resurrection would happen when Jesus
[51:21] himself rose from the dead the Old
[51:23] Testament Saints resurrected right in
[51:25] that area
[51:26] Abraham was buried next to Sarah and
[51:28] Isaac was buried there and Rebecca and
[51:30] Leah and all these different ones
[51:32] job was buried there Joseph it was so
[51:36] important that Joseph said whenever you
[51:38] leave here you take my bones and you
[51:40] bury him where you're going
[51:41] because he knew that the Messiah would
[51:44] come on the Earth
[51:46] and that that when the Messiah would
[51:48] come on the earth when Heroes they would
[51:50] rise with him so that was so important
[51:52] to Abraham he said no no no I'm not
[51:55] going to take it you name your price I'm
[51:57] going to pay you full price for this
[52:00] property because I want it written I
[52:02] want to make my borders sure I want the
[52:05] title D to this place not he said she
[52:07] said his mama said he needs the title
[52:10] deed and he wants to be able to go back
[52:12] to the beginning to where when when
[52:14] Isaac came along and Jacob came along
[52:16] they were able to say this is the father
[52:18] this is the land of my fathers right
[52:20] here I have the title deed to it here's
[52:23] the proof of purchase
[52:26] you don't get a proof of purchase when
[52:28] you get something for free
[52:30] you have a receipt when you pay for
[52:32] something
[52:33] that is how you can prove that it's been
[52:36] bought and has been fairly and legally
[52:39] paid for so Abraham had the legal right
[52:42] to this property he then could bury his
[52:45] dear wife Sarah there and he knew he
[52:47] could be buried there because he had the
[52:49] full he paid the full price
[52:54] he counted the cost he knew it was worth
[52:57] he knew the investment he was making he
[52:59] knew it wasn't just an investment of
[53:02] temporary Financial investment that
[53:04] would Advance his life here he knew it
[53:06] was for the generation to come and the
[53:08] investment that we're making as parents
[53:10] into this word we realize that this
[53:12] investment isn't just a temporary thing
[53:14] that we may leave them a little life
[53:16] insurance after we're gone or something
[53:17] we know that this investment will carry
[53:21] Eternal dividends we know that this
[53:23] investment will carry Eternal benefits
[53:26] to our children we don't know how long
[53:28] God's going to tear we believe he's
[53:30] going to come at any time
[53:32] you live like he's coming tomorrow
[53:36] but yet you plan like he won't come for
[53:38] 100 years you want to plant your
[53:40] potatoes as they said
[53:41] you want to still plan because there's
[53:43] there's also there can be a mistaken
[53:45] you're you're so determined you're so
[53:47] waiting on the coming of the Lord you
[53:48] don't even plan for the future
[53:52] you got to be wise
[53:54] so you live like he's coming tomorrow
[53:56] but you're playing like he's not coming
[53:57] for 50 years
[54:00] but we have an eternal investment in
[54:03] this word
[54:05] we think of Ruth and Boaz
[54:07] Boaz was a very rich man
[54:10] but you know Boaz was willing to pay the
[54:14] price for Ruth
[54:16] he had access to lots of Hebrew to Young
[54:21] Israelite Hebrew virgin girls that he
[54:24] could have taken for himself as a wife
[54:27] but whenever he seen Ruth she was a
[54:30] moabitus she was a curse she came from a
[54:33] cursed Nation but whenever Boaz fell
[54:36] whenever his eyes fell on Ruth there was
[54:38] something brother Chris that was so he
[54:40] was so driven to get her
[54:42] he didn't care what it cost he didn't
[54:45] care what he how he had to put himself
[54:47] out there he was he he was willing to
[54:49] pay the price he was willing to Bear her
[54:51] reproach
[54:53] he was willing he was ready to put out
[54:55] his reputation his wealth everything
[54:57] that stood behind the name of Boaz he
[54:59] was ready to put on the line for Ruth
[55:02] for a moabite for a gentile
[55:06] he was willing to do it and he was
[55:08] willing to pay the price
[55:12] he had to have her
[55:15] he was driven to get Ruth
[55:18] regardless of every obstacle
[55:21] regardless of a nearer Kinsmen
[55:23] he knew he had to get her and he was
[55:26] willing to pay whatever it took Boaz had
[55:29] all the wealth he had all the land he
[55:32] had it already
[55:33] but he wanted Ruth
[55:36] God had all of Heaven
[55:39] he had all the angels
[55:41] he had all the Boaz had servants God had
[55:44] servants God has Angels God has
[55:46] cherubims but he wanted you
[55:49] he wanted Ruth he wanted a gentile he
[55:53] wanted Gentiles that ran around with
[55:54] clubs on their back he wanted Gentiles
[55:57] that were Pagan worshipers when he was
[55:59] on the earth our ancestors were
[56:01] worshiping pagans we're worshiping idols
[56:04] and were Pagan to the core our Gentiles
[56:06] were not looking for no Messiah
[56:09] but he left all of Glory he left all the
[56:12] land all the wealth he was willing to
[56:13] put it all on the line because he wanted
[56:16] Ruth
[56:17] because he wanted a gentile
[56:21] that's what love he has for you
[56:23] he wasn't satisfied with just the Jews
[56:25] he wanted you
[56:27] in fact he wanted you so bad that he
[56:30] blinded his own children the Jews
[56:33] so he could get you
[56:36] that love is literally beyond
[56:39] comprehension
[56:41] you cannot we cannot comprehend now
[56:43] Naomi has a Redemption she's in there
[56:45] with Ruth
[56:48] but we cannot comprehend the love of
[56:50] that
[56:51] we cannot comprehend in Ruth chapter 4
[56:53] verse 9 and Boaz said unto all the
[56:55] elders
[56:57] and unto all the people ye are witnesses
[56:59] this day that I have bought all that was
[57:03] a limilex and all that was Chilean and
[57:05] melons at the hand of Naomi moreover
[57:07] Ruth the moabitus the wife of Mahon have
[57:10] I purchased to be my wife
[57:14] amen Jesus Christ purchased us with
[57:18] literally his own blood to be his wife
[57:23] and all the people that were in the gate
[57:25] and all the elders well let me excuse me
[57:28] let me go back to raise up the name of
[57:30] the Dead upon his inheritance at the
[57:31] name of the Dead be not cut off from
[57:33] among the Brethren and from the Gate of
[57:35] it of his place ye are witnesses
[57:40] this day
[57:42] when God saved you he did it in front of
[57:44] witnesses he didn't do it in a corner
[57:45] this message was preached in front of
[57:47] witnesses it wasn't in a corner
[57:50] he met an angel in a cave
[57:52] now there's righteousness in believing
[57:55] that
[57:55] just like it that God that that God
[57:59] accounted unto Abraham for righteousness
[58:01] his faith
[58:02] righteousness is attributed to you
[58:04] because you believe the story of the
[58:05] angel that visited the prophet in the
[58:07] cave
[58:08] and then he tells you the story and then
[58:11] he proves it the angel of God proves it
[58:14] by demonstrating it
[58:17] in front of the witnesses
[58:20] David a great man of God how many have
[58:22] heard of him
[58:24] you know David was a man
[58:26] the Bible says Elijah was a man of light
[58:28] passions as we are what David was no
[58:30] different
[58:32] you know David David had a lot of faults
[58:34] as we all do
[58:37] but yet God out of all the people in the
[58:40] Bible God chose that all the prophets
[58:41] and all the sages God chose to identify
[58:44] himself
[58:45] with the kingship of David
[58:48] so when David you know David he was a
[58:51] king and everything and and he decided
[58:53] one day that he was going to take a
[58:54] census
[58:55] he wanted to number how because you know
[58:57] God would tell him hey you go here and
[58:59] you go this way go by the way the
[59:00] moberries when you hear that wind when
[59:02] you hear me go by that's the time for
[59:04] you and he would actually lay out the
[59:06] strategy for David David would go up you
[59:08] talk about counting the cost and one
[59:09] King going against another and he'd
[59:11] count the cost and say God I don't have
[59:13] enough men there's just a few of us
[59:16] you know and there's a Philistines right
[59:17] there like grasshoppers they're like
[59:19] bugs out there and God will say hey
[59:21] don't worry
[59:23] I've delivered them into your hands you
[59:24] go this way when they go this way this
[59:26] way and you and you see them run you
[59:28] read the Bible you see how the battles
[59:30] happen
[59:32] so David knew but yet he always depended
[59:36] on God to tell him that's how God wants
[59:40] it
[59:40] and so David one day he decided that he
[59:42] was going to number the people and you
[59:44] know God don't want us to always have to
[59:46] figure out
[59:47] how he does things he don't always want
[59:50] us he don't want us trying to figure out
[59:51] now how is God going to heal me
[59:54] how is God going to bring my prodigal he
[59:56] looks so sinful she looked she's so far
[59:59] gone how God how are you going to do it
[1:00:01] don't take a census
[1:00:03] don't sit there and try and figure out
[1:00:05] how God's gonna do something let him be
[1:00:06] God
[1:00:08] because remember God works in a paradox
[1:00:11] it's past finding out how did Joshua
[1:00:14] tell the son to sit still how can you
[1:00:15] figure that out you can't
[1:00:19] so God don't want you trying to figure
[1:00:21] stuff out
[1:00:23] faith is about believing it's about
[1:00:25] resting now Faith is a substance faith
[1:00:27] is not just hope it's not a Fly by Night
[1:00:29] Faith needs a resting place and it's a
[1:00:31] place that you rest so you don't have to
[1:00:33] always you don't have to understand
[1:00:34] faith
[1:00:36] you believe
[1:00:38] and it's a revelation to you
[1:00:40] and that's what you hold on to so God
[1:00:43] wants us to depend on him so he began
[1:00:44] and joab withstood him he said God don't
[1:00:47] want you doing this but but David was
[1:00:49] determined
[1:00:51] to have his way
[1:00:53] and he did
[1:00:54] and that really really caused him some
[1:00:56] problems there was a prophet in the land
[1:00:57] by the name of God and the lord gave him
[1:00:59] whenever he did that God came to him
[1:01:01] through a prophet and he gave him three
[1:01:03] options
[1:01:05] and in first Chronicles 21
[1:01:08] and David said unto God
[1:01:10] I am in a great Strait because see that
[1:01:12] God gave him options he said either
[1:01:14] you're going to have three years of
[1:01:15] famine
[1:01:16] you're going to have three months of
[1:01:17] defeat before your enemies or you're
[1:01:19] going to have three days of pestilence
[1:01:21] of plague and sickness
[1:01:23] so David said unto God I am in a great
[1:01:26] Strait let me fall now in the hand of
[1:01:28] the Lord for very great are his mercies
[1:01:30] but let me not fall into the hand of man
[1:01:33] that was actually a good response David
[1:01:36] humbled himself and he knew God is
[1:01:37] merciful so I'm going to let him decide
[1:01:39] My Punishment
[1:01:40] so the Lord sent pestilence upon Israel
[1:01:44] and their fell of Israel seventy
[1:01:47] thousand men
[1:01:48] and God sent an angel into Jerusalem to
[1:01:51] destroy it
[1:01:53] and as he was destroying the Lord beheld
[1:01:55] and repented him of the evil and said to
[1:01:58] the angel that destroyed it's enough now
[1:02:00] stay now thy hand
[1:02:02] and the angel of the Lord stood by the
[1:02:05] threshing floor of ornan the jebusite
[1:02:08] here's another Gentile
[1:02:11] and David lifted up his eyes and saw the
[1:02:13] angel of the Lord stand Between Heaven
[1:02:15] between the Earth and the heaven having
[1:02:18] a sword drawn in his hand stretched out
[1:02:21] over Jerusalem then David and the Elders
[1:02:24] of Israel who were clothed in sackcloth
[1:02:25] fell upon their faces and David said
[1:02:27] unto God is it not I that commanded the
[1:02:30] people to be numbered even I it is that
[1:02:33] have sinned and done evil indeed but as
[1:02:34] for these sheep what have they done let
[1:02:36] thine hand I pray thee O Lord my God be
[1:02:39] on me and on my father's house but not
[1:02:41] on thy people that they should be
[1:02:43] plagued
[1:02:44] then the angel of the Lord commanded God
[1:02:46] to say to David that David should go up
[1:02:49] and set an altar into the Lord in the
[1:02:52] threshing floor of ornan the jebusite
[1:02:55] now a threshing floor it could be indoor
[1:02:57] or an outdoor but if it was an outdoor
[1:02:59] like this one it was like a hard packed
[1:03:01] area
[1:03:02] and what they would do is they would
[1:03:03] bring in their crops and a lot of times
[1:03:05] it was shared by the community and they
[1:03:06] would they'd put their crops in their
[1:03:07] their wheat and they would just either
[1:03:08] step on it or they would just Beat It
[1:03:11] and it would separate the grain out of
[1:03:13] the chaff or out of the shut that's what
[1:03:15] they would do because the community in
[1:03:17] Israel
[1:03:18] in lots of ancient times they depended
[1:03:19] on farming
[1:03:21] so day and day in verse 19 and David
[1:03:23] went up at that saying of God which he
[1:03:25] spake in the name of the Lord and ornan
[1:03:27] turned back and saw the angel
[1:03:30] and His Four Sons with him hid
[1:03:32] themselves now ornan was threshing wheat
[1:03:34] and as David came to ornan ornan looked
[1:03:36] and saw David and went out to the
[1:03:38] threshing floor
[1:03:39] and bowed himself to David with his face
[1:03:42] to the ground then David sets on and
[1:03:44] Grant me the place of this threshing
[1:03:45] floor remember the angel told him you go
[1:03:48] to oronin you get that threshing floor
[1:03:50] and you build me an altar in that spot
[1:03:52] so David goes up to ornament because hey
[1:03:54] he's humble now
[1:03:56] and he goes up and does exactly like the
[1:03:58] prophet said
[1:03:59] grant me the place of this threshing
[1:04:01] floor that I may build and altar therein
[1:04:03] and to the Lord Thou shalt Grant it me
[1:04:07] for the full price
[1:04:10] he wasn't looking for a cell he wasn't
[1:04:12] looking for a deal he knew he did wrong
[1:04:14] and he was ready to pay the full price
[1:04:16] for what he did
[1:04:19] that the plague may be stayed from the
[1:04:21] people and watch this and orange say to
[1:04:23] David take it to thee and let my Lord
[1:04:25] the king do that which is good in his
[1:04:27] eyes lo I give thee The Oxen also for
[1:04:30] the burnt offerings and the threshing
[1:04:31] instruments for wood and the wheat for
[1:04:33] the for the meat offering I give it all
[1:04:35] I'll give it to you you're the king
[1:04:38] and the King David sets on a nay
[1:04:41] but I will verily buy it for the full
[1:04:45] price
[1:04:47] for I will not take that which is dying
[1:04:49] for the Lord nor offer burnt offerings
[1:04:52] without costs
[1:04:55] when we serve God it's got to cost us
[1:04:57] something we can't come on some flowery
[1:05:00] bed of eat some dried out confession
[1:05:02] shake the preacher's hand and then say
[1:05:03] we have the Holy Ghost or just say we
[1:05:05] believe God sent a prophet and that's
[1:05:06] the Holy Ghost no you've got to die it's
[1:05:09] got to cost you your life it's got to
[1:05:11] cost you your pride It's gotta cost you
[1:05:13] your place it's Gotta cost you
[1:05:15] everything
[1:05:16] because if you're gonna lose your life
[1:05:18] if you're gonna gain your life you got
[1:05:20] to lose a life it's life for a life
[1:05:24] it's got to cost you something you can't
[1:05:26] get it for free
[1:05:30] now salvation is paid for
[1:05:33] salvation in that way is free is freely
[1:05:36] given but it costs somebody something
[1:05:39] but yet it's a daily cost to us
[1:05:42] to take up our cross and follow him
[1:05:46] so David was ready he said not without
[1:05:48] cost so David gave to ornan for the
[1:05:50] place 600 shekels of gold by weight and
[1:05:53] David built there an altar to the Lord
[1:05:55] and offered burnt offerings and peace
[1:05:57] offerings and called upon the Lord and
[1:05:58] he answered him
[1:06:00] from Heaven by fire
[1:06:02] God answered David by fire
[1:06:05] you come with the same humble attitude
[1:06:08] and God will meet you by fire
[1:06:11] he will consume your sacrifice say Lord
[1:06:13] I'm good for nothing
[1:06:16] every one of us good for nothing
[1:06:18] Lord here's my life here's my future
[1:06:21] here's everything any question here's my
[1:06:24] entire future here it is
[1:06:26] I give it to you it's going to cost me
[1:06:28] friends it may cost me a job it may cost
[1:06:31] me my marriage I don't care what it
[1:06:33] costs I'm giving it to you right here
[1:06:36] and I pr I I I I shouldn't say I promise
[1:06:39] you God promises you that he will answer
[1:06:42] by fire
[1:06:43] he will consume your sacrifice
[1:06:47] he's still the god that answers by fire
[1:06:51] and the Lord commanded the angel and he
[1:06:53] put up his sword again into the sheath
[1:06:56] thereof
[1:06:57] we're talking about the Tree of Life
[1:06:58] brother Fred
[1:07:00] after after God's judgment has been
[1:07:02] appeased
[1:07:04] the angel that was holding his sword
[1:07:06] above Jerusalem as the plague was going
[1:07:08] on and what was it seventy thousand men
[1:07:10] died
[1:07:11] he sheets it it's done
[1:07:15] now this threshing floor because
[1:07:17] remember after the full price was paid
[1:07:19] on Calvary
[1:07:20] remember when Adam and Eve sinned and
[1:07:21] they left the Garden of Eden the
[1:07:23] cherubimes had a flaming sword that kept
[1:07:25] away
[1:07:26] you couldn't get close to the Tree of
[1:07:27] Life
[1:07:28] but after Jesus Christ came and he gave
[1:07:30] his life
[1:07:31] sheath
[1:07:33] now it's come
[1:07:35] come the cherubims are calling or the
[1:07:39] tree of life is calling the Chairman's
[1:07:40] like push and go the Tree of Life there
[1:07:42] he is he's the way of access has been
[1:07:44] made again
[1:07:46] the Judgment Angel's sword has been
[1:07:49] sheathed
[1:07:51] to you you've got full access when these
[1:07:54] brothers get up and they pray over the
[1:07:56] request and you're praying out there we
[1:07:58] have full access brother Jerry to the
[1:08:01] throne of God we've got full access to
[1:08:03] his healing we've got full access to
[1:08:04] everything that he has for us full
[1:08:07] access
[1:08:09] Now understand
[1:08:11] because whenever they were bringing the
[1:08:12] temple back and David was dancing and
[1:08:14] having a good time there was a man that
[1:08:16] wasn't accessed yet and there was a man
[1:08:18] The Oxen stumbled and he just he just
[1:08:20] tried to help
[1:08:21] and his Instinct was to try and just
[1:08:23] touch the art and hit and help it so it
[1:08:25] don't fall he didn't want the word
[1:08:26] falling
[1:08:28] but he wasn't a levite
[1:08:30] because David was acting out of the will
[1:08:32] you've heard trying to do God of service
[1:08:34] without it being the will of God
[1:08:36] and it caused that man to die
[1:08:38] but now handle the word
[1:08:41] run to the word run to the Tree of Life
[1:08:45] now it's not preach the word for
[1:08:47] everybody
[1:08:49] but you've given access remember in in
[1:08:52] during the church ages the Dark Ages the
[1:08:54] priests were taking the Catholic Church
[1:08:55] took the word from the people and made
[1:08:57] it in a language they couldn't
[1:08:58] understand that's Antichrist the word is
[1:09:01] for everybody access it eat it the tree
[1:09:04] of life here you go here you go every
[1:09:06] every weekend these brothers they they
[1:09:08] get they trying to access looky here
[1:09:10] look here the Tree of Life look at it
[1:09:12] from this Angle now look at it from this
[1:09:14] angle isn't he wonderful the Tree of
[1:09:16] Life
[1:09:17] now it's interesting that this threshing
[1:09:19] floor that David paid full price for
[1:09:22] it was the it was the same place
[1:09:25] that Abraham took up his son one day
[1:09:29] it was the same place that Abraham was
[1:09:31] getting ready to sacrifice this promised
[1:09:34] son everything that God promised
[1:09:36] everything he believed God for for 25
[1:09:38] years in a moment he was about to take
[1:09:40] him out of this life
[1:09:43] and at the very last moment God stayed
[1:09:45] his hand he said Abraham I know you love
[1:09:48] me
[1:09:48] I know you love me because you waited
[1:09:50] for this time for 25 years at 12 years
[1:09:52] 12 years later you're ready to take his
[1:09:54] life
[1:09:56] and that pleased God
[1:09:58] in the same place because remember the
[1:10:01] angel of the Lord told David you go up
[1:10:02] to that man
[1:10:04] you go up to ornament and you take that
[1:10:06] you pay you go on now see the angel
[1:10:08] actually didn't even tell David go buy
[1:10:10] it
[1:10:10] he said go up there and make a sacrifice
[1:10:13] Dave is going up there and he was
[1:10:14] getting ready to get it right in his lap
[1:10:16] here you go here here's all the
[1:10:17] instruments here's the oxen everything
[1:10:19] my king here it is
[1:10:21] but David knew it had to cost him
[1:10:24] something
[1:10:25] he knew he had to pay the full price for
[1:10:27] it
[1:10:28] it was a spiritual strain in David
[1:10:32] that place where Abraham went to kill
[1:10:35] Isaac
[1:10:36] is this same place the threshing floor
[1:10:38] where God answered by fire
[1:10:41] it's then a place after this even
[1:10:42] happened you read in the scriptures he
[1:10:44] begins to gather he begins to gather
[1:10:45] material for the temple but God said you
[1:10:47] shed too much blood your son's going to
[1:10:49] build it and that's where Solomon's
[1:10:52] Temple stood
[1:10:53] and God after when Solomon dedicated the
[1:10:55] temple you read in the scriptures what
[1:10:57] happened God was still the god that
[1:10:59] answered by fire he was still the god
[1:11:00] that the glory of the Lord came down
[1:11:02] they couldn't even stand to minister
[1:11:04] but oh that's nothing in comparison
[1:11:07] to hundreds of years later when another
[1:11:09] sacrifice was walking up
[1:11:13] the sacrifice that was willing to pay
[1:11:16] the full price
[1:11:19] he didn't just come just to get your
[1:11:22] healing
[1:11:23] he didn't come just to make you a better
[1:11:25] person
[1:11:27] he came to pay the full price for you
[1:11:30] he came so that we know whenever you
[1:11:32] read the scriptures in Saint John 17 and
[1:11:34] Jesus was praying he said father
[1:11:36] I will
[1:11:38] I desire
[1:11:40] this is a desire that he said that he
[1:11:42] had he said I will that they be
[1:11:46] with me
[1:11:48] where I am
[1:11:52] that's his desire for you
[1:11:55] it was the same place where our Lord was
[1:11:57] beaten and he paid the price
[1:12:02] and you might have made a a mess out of
[1:12:04] your life just like David did
[1:12:07] David was responsible for for the death
[1:12:09] of 70 000 men
[1:12:13] that's a mess
[1:12:15] that's some serious chaos
[1:12:19] but come to the threshing floor
[1:12:21] Christ Jesus and die out to yourself and
[1:12:24] be born again
[1:12:26] First Peter 1 18 for as much as you know
[1:12:28] that ye were not redeemed with
[1:12:30] corruptable things as silver and gold
[1:12:32] from your vain conversation received by
[1:12:34] tradition from your fathers but with the
[1:12:36] precious blood of Jesus of Christ as of
[1:12:40] a lamb without blemish and without spot
[1:12:43] that's what you were bought with the
[1:12:44] precious blood
[1:12:47] of Jesus Christ
[1:12:49] because remember blood was the only
[1:12:50] thing that could pay the price for
[1:12:52] Redemption
[1:12:54] God required blood
[1:12:56] but who whose blood
[1:12:58] because everybody is sinful
[1:13:01] the animals were beneath that covered
[1:13:04] sin for a while
[1:13:05] but that was not perfect
[1:13:08] because the animal species is under the
[1:13:10] human species so that means someone
[1:13:12] above Humanity had to come down
[1:13:16] and remember when God in the order of
[1:13:18] the creation he started the lowest forms
[1:13:20] of life and he worked his way up man was
[1:13:22] a Capstone of God's creation
[1:13:24] in intelligence he was made in the image
[1:13:27] of God so when that man when his
[1:13:30] Masterpiece fell
[1:13:32] there was nothing above man but God
[1:13:35] he was the only one
[1:13:37] that could come and give his life
[1:13:41] but see you can't kill God so he had to
[1:13:43] become a man
[1:13:45] in order to die for us
[1:13:47] because you can't kill God
[1:13:50] in Matthew 26 Jesus is in the garden
[1:13:53] he's beginning to count Lacoste he's
[1:13:55] going through his ministry and the
[1:13:57] weight of the sin is really beginning to
[1:13:59] settle in here
[1:14:01] then cometh Jesus with him into a place
[1:14:03] called Gethsemane and saith unto the
[1:14:05] disciples sit ye here while I go and
[1:14:07] pray under and he took with him Peter
[1:14:09] and the two sons of Zebedee and begin to
[1:14:11] be sorrowful and very heavy then saith
[1:14:15] he to them my soul is exceeding
[1:14:16] sorrowful even unto death tear ye here
[1:14:19] and watch with me and he went a little
[1:14:21] further and fell on his face and prayed
[1:14:22] saying oh my father if it be possible
[1:14:25] let this cup pass for me
[1:14:27] nevertheless
[1:14:29] not as I will
[1:14:32] but as thou will
[1:14:35] I want to read a quote here brother I'm
[1:14:37] speaking said let's just think
[1:14:39] I can see Gabriel come down his great
[1:14:42] sword standing by his side
[1:14:44] I can see wood worm I can see the other
[1:14:46] great Angels Lighting on the Rocks
[1:14:49] around what was it a conference table
[1:14:51] was being set
[1:14:54] then that holy spirit of God as we see
[1:14:57] the picture of Gethsemane that light
[1:14:58] which God is light Elohim
[1:15:01] the self-existing one when he came down
[1:15:03] into his presence do you want to go
[1:15:06] through with this son
[1:15:09] Jesus had a choice
[1:15:11] he had a decision to make
[1:15:15] do you want
[1:15:16] what the angels are listening what it's
[1:15:19] going to be the result the whole world
[1:15:22] lays upon your shoulder
[1:15:24] do you want to pay the price or what do
[1:15:27] you want to do
[1:15:28] you can imagine the breathlessness of
[1:15:30] Heaven during these moments
[1:15:32] they knew who Jesus was
[1:15:34] they knew exactly who he was the
[1:15:36] religious churches of the day had didn't
[1:15:37] know who he was they called him the
[1:15:40] devil and all these things but they knew
[1:15:42] do you want to pay the price
[1:15:45] or what do you want to do you can come
[1:15:47] right on now without death their lays
[1:15:49] Calvary before you there they'll spit in
[1:15:51] your face they'll take you to Calvary
[1:15:53] all these things you'll die in agony
[1:15:55] with a crown of thorns on your head and
[1:15:58] your blood will drain out
[1:16:00] are you willing
[1:16:03] and it's Jesus and his Humanity had to
[1:16:06] deal with these emotions
[1:16:08] he had to deal with the with your sin
[1:16:10] and my sin being laid on him
[1:16:13] and he began because Jesus really died
[1:16:15] in The Garden of Gethsemane because
[1:16:16] that's where he died to himself
[1:16:19] that's where he had to die and have this
[1:16:21] conference
[1:16:22] with the angels
[1:16:25] and the sin began to be laid on his
[1:16:27] shoulder and it was so intense
[1:16:29] that the blood and the water in his body
[1:16:32] begin to separate
[1:16:34] and it's at this moment
[1:16:37] he could have been thinking about you
[1:16:39] brother Thomas
[1:16:41] feeling the agony of the hour feeling
[1:16:43] the agony of the sins because remember
[1:16:45] it wasn't just the sins of his age it
[1:16:48] was the sins from Adam to the very last
[1:16:49] one from beginning to end it's the sin
[1:16:52] of all Humanity
[1:16:54] was beginning to be unloaded on his
[1:16:56] shoulders and he had to make a decision
[1:16:58] what was he going to do
[1:17:01] was he willing to pay the price
[1:17:05] so you could be here right now
[1:17:08] so you could have a theophany and Glory
[1:17:11] so you can be healed
[1:17:14] he had to wrestle with this question
[1:17:19] he knew that in order for you to be with
[1:17:21] him like he desired he'd have to pay the
[1:17:24] price
[1:17:26] because all the Miracles and all the
[1:17:28] wonderful teachings and all them
[1:17:29] wonderful things that he did if come to
[1:17:31] this point he'll say father I can't do
[1:17:33] it
[1:17:34] it's going to be too ill
[1:17:36] it is suffering's gonna be too bad I
[1:17:38] can't take it Take Me Lord
[1:17:42] we wouldn't have benefited one iota from
[1:17:44] that
[1:17:48] but yet throughout the ceaseless ages
[1:17:50] we'll be with him
[1:17:52] because he counted the cost
[1:17:56] of your sin sister Cassie
[1:17:59] of yours brother Jerry
[1:18:02] of every person he counted the cost
[1:18:06] and he was willing to go
[1:18:10] that is how people send their soul their
[1:18:13] own selves to hell
[1:18:14] because the way has been made and then
[1:18:17] they don't they they look at it so well
[1:18:19] it's going to cost me this
[1:18:22] it's going to cost me that career or
[1:18:24] maybe it'll cost me what I've always
[1:18:26] wanted to do to cost me a million
[1:18:28] dollars if I do this
[1:18:29] it's gonna cost me
[1:18:32] so I'm just gonna be a secret believer I
[1:18:34] mean I believe it's the truth but it's
[1:18:36] the truth over there but I'm not going
[1:18:38] to take it to myself and that won't help
[1:18:40] you on the day of judgment I promise you
[1:18:42] that
[1:18:44] amen you've got to count the cost
[1:18:47] and that intensity
[1:18:49] of the sins coming right on him being
[1:18:52] transferred onto him because remember in
[1:18:53] the Old Testament they put their hands
[1:18:54] on the sacrifice
[1:18:56] and that would in type
[1:18:58] as an as a symbol set would transfer
[1:19:02] your sins unto the lamb
[1:19:05] and the the transfer of sins of all
[1:19:08] Humanity at that moment was being put on
[1:19:09] Jesus Christ in the garden in the Garden
[1:19:11] of Gethsemane
[1:19:13] he said let's see that conference what
[1:19:16] the conference what's the echo going to
[1:19:17] be all angels are standing around what
[1:19:21] takes place now the decisions made what
[1:19:22] is it not my will
[1:19:25] but thine be done
[1:19:28] oh
[1:19:29] you could just
[1:19:31] you can just let out a sigh of relief
[1:19:35] oh the Angels unfolded Their Blessings
[1:19:37] and began to minister to him then
[1:19:39] preparing him for that great hour a
[1:19:42] conference was set a decision was made
[1:19:44] I'm so glad
[1:19:48] of that decision
[1:19:52] aren't you so glad of that decision
[1:19:54] because remember Satan offered him the
[1:19:56] entire Kingdom without the cross and
[1:19:58] that was one of the big Temptations is
[1:20:00] that you can have
[1:20:01] you're going to be king of the earth and
[1:20:03] and you can have all these nations and
[1:20:06] all the glory of them but you don't and
[1:20:08] the you know what the best part is
[1:20:10] Satan is a shrewd businessman
[1:20:13] I'll give you all this
[1:20:16] and the best part is you don't have to
[1:20:18] suffer
[1:20:20] you can just take it
[1:20:23] you got to worship me but you gotta
[1:20:25] worship me but you just
[1:20:27] I'll just give it to you
[1:20:30] and Jesus said a gift thee behind me
[1:20:32] Satan
[1:20:34] he said he come and he suffered and took
[1:20:36] the hard rugged route he took the route
[1:20:38] of persecution he took the route
[1:20:41] of death
[1:20:43] he had to die it was the only way to pay
[1:20:45] the full price
[1:20:46] but living he loved me
[1:20:49] dying he saved me
[1:20:52] buried he carried my sins far away
[1:20:56] Rising he justified freely forever
[1:20:59] someday he's coming
[1:21:01] oh Glorious Day
[1:21:04] when Jesus was up there on the cross at
[1:21:06] his Boaz he was in front of a lot of
[1:21:07] witnesses
[1:21:09] when he said it is finished
[1:21:11] Heaven witnessed that he was dead
[1:21:14] the Earth witnessed that he was dead
[1:21:17] hell thought he was dead
[1:21:20] hell thought they actually got rid of
[1:21:21] him
[1:21:22] the Earth the Earth was so convinced he
[1:21:25] was dead brother said the son said I
[1:21:26] don't even want to Shine Anymore
[1:21:28] the Earth there was a massive earthquake
[1:21:31] had the nerd that the Earth was having a
[1:21:34] nervous breakdown because the great
[1:21:35] Creator was just killed
[1:21:39] and when hell thought they got him it
[1:21:42] was just the beginning
[1:21:45] because remember perfect strength is
[1:21:47] imperfect weakness
[1:21:49] so whenever whenever Jesus looked weak
[1:21:52] he was actually strong
[1:21:55] he was actually strong
[1:21:57] now Jesus tells us so beautiful a
[1:22:00] beautiful parable about a good shepherd
[1:22:03] because we know that pastors are
[1:22:06] Shepherds
[1:22:08] and God places shepherds in the church
[1:22:10] to watch over us
[1:22:12] but you know he's the chief Shepherd
[1:22:16] God sends prophets but he's the chief
[1:22:19] prophet
[1:22:21] he is the executive
[1:22:26] so he is the Good Shepherd in Saint John
[1:22:28] chapter 10 verily verily I say unto you
[1:22:31] he that entereth not by the door and to
[1:22:33] the Sheepfold but clineth up some other
[1:22:35] way the same as a thief and a robber
[1:22:38] but he that entereth him by the door is
[1:22:40] The Shepherd of the sheep to him the
[1:22:42] poor to openeth and the sheep hear his
[1:22:45] voice
[1:22:46] and he calleth his own sheep by name
[1:22:53] you know you can have a herd of
[1:22:57] 100 sheep or 100 cattle or whatever you
[1:23:00] want to have
[1:23:02] and it's not that likely your number
[1:23:04] you'll name them all
[1:23:08] it's hard to
[1:23:10] sometimes calling this the kids around
[1:23:12] the house you get them just mixed up you
[1:23:13] know I mean it's just Rebecca I like to
[1:23:16] know it no you you know Wesley
[1:23:19] and that's just five
[1:23:23] just five
[1:23:27] but you know God has a flock
[1:23:30] so he's scriptural I have a flock
[1:23:32] Jesus has a lot
[1:23:37] so God has a flock too and he knows them
[1:23:39] all by name
[1:23:41] but he don't get you mixed up
[1:23:44] he knows you by name he knows your
[1:23:46] personality he knows where you are he
[1:23:48] knows your Tendencies he knows your
[1:23:50] Temptations
[1:23:52] and remember when brother man went out
[1:23:53] east I think it was in India or
[1:23:55] somewhere and he seen the shepherd
[1:23:56] leading all them sheep he was so amazed
[1:23:58] that he could lead an entire herd of
[1:24:00] sheep and none of them sheep were
[1:24:01] bothered they just had their eyes on the
[1:24:03] shepherd
[1:24:04] and that's how it is with us and Jesus
[1:24:06] we have our eyes on him
[1:24:08] so the Bible said or he says and he
[1:24:10] calleth his own Sheep by name and
[1:24:13] leadeth them out and when he puteth
[1:24:15] forth his sheep he goeth before them see
[1:24:17] he's doing the leading he's the shepherd
[1:24:21] and the Sheep follow him for they know
[1:24:23] his voice
[1:24:26] but he that is in hireling in verse 12
[1:24:30] and not the shepherd whose own the Sheep
[1:24:32] are not seeth the wolf coming and they
[1:24:34] leave at the Sheep
[1:24:36] they're out of there because if she
[1:24:38] don't belong to him
[1:24:40] but the shepherd defends the sheep with
[1:24:42] his own life
[1:24:43] because the Sheep belonged to him
[1:24:47] in verse 13 the hireling fleth because
[1:24:49] he is in Harlingen careth not for the
[1:24:51] Sheep I am the Good Shepherd
[1:24:54] and know my sheep and am known of mine
[1:24:58] as a father knoweth me even so I know
[1:25:00] the father and I lay down my life for
[1:25:03] the Sheep what beautiful words
[1:25:07] that he knows you by name he knows where
[1:25:10] you're at
[1:25:11] if you go missing
[1:25:13] he notices
[1:25:17] the Good Shepherd remember the Good
[1:25:19] Shepherd left 99 of his flock
[1:25:24] to come get you
[1:25:27] 99 is just a mathematical equation we're
[1:25:30] taught we're one out of a million
[1:25:32] so he left 999
[1:25:35] 999 sheep
[1:25:38] because he noticed you were missing
[1:25:41] and Satan might have tricked you right
[1:25:43] out of that fold
[1:25:46] and he said hey
[1:25:47] so and so is missing
[1:25:50] I laid them down to sleep right here
[1:25:53] and they're not here this morning
[1:25:56] because he knows you by name
[1:26:00] he notices a single lamb that goes
[1:26:04] astray
[1:26:06] and maybe that lamb he got separated by
[1:26:08] a wolf maybe the lamb was real curious
[1:26:12] and he left the protection of the fold
[1:26:15] and the lamb wandered off
[1:26:18] and in the morning the shepherd the Good
[1:26:20] Shepherd he wakes up
[1:26:22] because remember he's the door he lays
[1:26:23] down in front of the
[1:26:25] in front of the flock
[1:26:27] and nothing can cross and get to you
[1:26:30] except to go over the shepherd first
[1:26:33] because you you sometimes can feel like
[1:26:35] you're having such a awful trial God did
[1:26:38] you see this coming yeah he did
[1:26:41] God seen it coming before there was a
[1:26:43] world
[1:26:45] but yet the great Shepherd will get up
[1:26:49] and he notices you're missing and he
[1:26:51] counts the cost
[1:26:53] you think about it in our natural
[1:26:55] Humanity this shows how far above Agape
[1:26:58] Love Is
[1:26:59] a buffalo
[1:27:01] if we had a million sheep
[1:27:04] if we I don't think we wouldn't even
[1:27:06] notice one was gone
[1:27:08] and if it was probably like
[1:27:12] oh well
[1:27:14] [Applause]
[1:27:20] especially if you didn't know where I
[1:27:21] was at now if he's seen it you'd go get
[1:27:23] it you would do the right thing
[1:27:25] but the Good Shepherd ain't like this
[1:27:28] the Good Shepherd knows you're missing
[1:27:30] and he'll come after you he doesn't say
[1:27:32] oh well
[1:27:33] he says no no no no no I've got one
[1:27:36] missing and I'm gonna go after that
[1:27:38] single one and I'm gonna Risk Everything
[1:27:40] to get that lamb back
[1:27:42] and I'm gonna bring that sheep right
[1:27:45] back to the fold and I'm not happy until
[1:27:48] that sheet that one out of a million
[1:27:50] sheep is back here that's when I'm happy
[1:27:52] again
[1:27:53] so the shepherd begins to count the cost
[1:27:55] and he may have to to climb up mountains
[1:27:57] and scrape his knees and go through
[1:27:59] Briar patches and get cut and get
[1:28:01] bruised and twist his ankle but you know
[1:28:04] what he's on a mission
[1:28:06] look how many look at the great Shepherd
[1:28:08] when he climbed up that hill
[1:28:10] he was bruised and he was despised and
[1:28:12] he was rejected
[1:28:16] he doesn't consider he counts the cost
[1:28:18] of the danger
[1:28:20] but it does not affect his decision to
[1:28:22] come get you
[1:28:24] Isaiah 53 surely he hath borne our
[1:28:26] Greece and carried our sorrows yet we
[1:28:28] did esteem him stricken smitten of God
[1:28:30] and Afflicted but he was wounded for our
[1:28:33] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:28:36] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:28:39] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:28:42] healed
[1:28:43] remember the Shepherds Brothers said
[1:28:45] they would get whenever the shepherd the
[1:28:47] Sheep were sick they would they would
[1:28:48] need Limestone and it would help them
[1:28:50] heal so to get the Sheep to get the
[1:28:52] Limestone they put honey on the rock
[1:28:55] so whenever the shepherd whenever he
[1:28:58] went he made the same Journey that he
[1:29:00] went to get your salvation was the same
[1:29:02] journey to get you healing
[1:29:05] he cares about your healing he care he
[1:29:07] wants you to be healthy
[1:29:09] in verse 6 all we like sheep have gone
[1:29:13] astray
[1:29:14] and we have turned everyone to his own
[1:29:17] way and the Lord hath laid on him
[1:29:19] there's The Garden of Gethsemane the
[1:29:21] iniquity of us all
[1:29:23] but he has to get you there's no other
[1:29:26] way you may run from the shepherd for a
[1:29:28] while you know animals they can do that
[1:29:33] they'll see you and when they see you
[1:29:34] then they they run
[1:29:37] I've got a dog that does that
[1:29:41] praise the Lord but but you know he's
[1:29:43] not going to actually give up on this
[1:29:44] sheep
[1:29:46] you may run
[1:29:48] but he's going to draw you to himself
[1:29:51] and you know when he keeps calling your
[1:29:52] name he keeps wooing you you may be in
[1:29:55] service at the service at the service
[1:29:56] and you you just keep running and he's
[1:29:59] calling your name on Saturday night he's
[1:30:01] calling your name on Sunday morning and
[1:30:02] you're running a little further next
[1:30:04] weekend he's gonna be calling you again
[1:30:05] the next day he's gonna be calling you
[1:30:07] again because he's not gonna lose a
[1:30:09] single one he's gonna keep calling until
[1:30:12] he brings you back in the fold it
[1:30:14] doesn't matter where you are it doesn't
[1:30:16] matter if you're in a bar room it don't
[1:30:17] matter if you're in a house of ill fame
[1:30:19] or it doesn't matter if you're sitting
[1:30:20] in a message church for 20 years he
[1:30:22] calls your name and he won't be
[1:30:24] satisfied until you're back in the fold
[1:30:29] and then listen here
[1:30:31] you are on a journey once he's found you
[1:30:35] he now carefully
[1:30:39] carries you
[1:30:42] back to the fold of safety he is the
[1:30:45] door and you are secure in him
[1:30:48] I want you to listen to this he said
[1:30:50] brother I'm speaking here he said oh I
[1:30:51] want you to look at a beautiful thing
[1:30:53] here
[1:30:54] when Jesus goes to cast out a devil it's
[1:30:57] so little to him until he just takes his
[1:30:58] finger to cast it away his finger
[1:31:01] that's all he has to use oh Blessed Be
[1:31:04] His holy name he only uses a finger for
[1:31:06] the most powerful Dell devil that could
[1:31:09] rise out of the burning hell
[1:31:13] you name it what you want to cancer TB
[1:31:15] depression name it what you want to it's
[1:31:17] just the finger for the god that's it
[1:31:19] that's how he casts them out
[1:31:22] but when that's all he does he says but
[1:31:24] when he's got a lost sheep gone astray
[1:31:27] and when he goes to bring it back he
[1:31:30] takes it and he lays it over his
[1:31:33] shoulders
[1:31:37] the strongest part of a man is in his
[1:31:40] back and shoulders and he takes his
[1:31:41] strongest part not his finger
[1:31:44] but a lost sheep throws it over his
[1:31:46] shoulders and gently Bears it back to
[1:31:49] the fold
[1:31:52] God is not there to beat you he don't
[1:31:53] grab his Sheep by the ear and say why'd
[1:31:55] you run get over here
[1:31:57] he understands
[1:31:59] he'll reach down and he'll get you and
[1:32:02] he'll bear you on the strongest part
[1:32:05] and he gently
[1:32:07] he watches his steps as he goes off the
[1:32:09] mountain
[1:32:10] and he brings you back to the fold
[1:32:13] and when he brings you back to the fold
[1:32:14] he's more happy over you
[1:32:17] than over the 999 999 that never left
[1:32:22] because remember it doesn't matter how
[1:32:23] long you've been born again and how full
[1:32:25] of the Holy Ghost you are one day you
[1:32:28] are that lost sheep whenever it was it
[1:32:31] don't matter 50 years ago 20 years ago
[1:32:33] today
[1:32:34] at one day in your life if you're born
[1:32:38] again you are that lost sheet that he
[1:32:40] left everyone else for it to come get
[1:32:44] the preacher the minister is on a
[1:32:46] certain topic and he goes completely off
[1:32:47] topic to pick you up what is that that's
[1:32:48] a shepherd
[1:32:50] that's more than just the pastor
[1:32:52] Shepherd
[1:32:53] that is the great Chief Shepherd
[1:32:56] leaving the flock
[1:32:58] to come get you
[1:33:01] don't worry about that complex what that
[1:33:02] person said wasn't that don't let Satan
[1:33:04] tell you that come on back into
[1:33:06] Fellowship come back into church
[1:33:08] what is that that is the great Shepherd
[1:33:10] you know they have a shepherd's hook
[1:33:11] they call it
[1:33:13] no it's not yanking it's just leaning
[1:33:15] this way come back
[1:33:17] come back to the fold
[1:33:20] he's a great shipper
[1:33:23] there was a young girl many years ago
[1:33:26] and her name is Georgie Carter
[1:33:29] and brother Brandon he was a pastor in
[1:33:31] the church there in Jeffersonville I
[1:33:33] believe it was and he had a vision
[1:33:35] and in this Vision he heard a lamb
[1:33:38] blatant or blaton
[1:33:41] and as he was hearing it he was
[1:33:43] searching trying to find it but the
[1:33:44] closer he got to to the actual sound of
[1:33:47] the blatant he actually realized it was
[1:33:49] a human voice and it was crying out Mill
[1:33:51] Town
[1:33:53] Middletown
[1:33:55] and brother Ram realized he went back to
[1:33:57] church and he realized that he had to
[1:33:58] find where this was and he began to ask
[1:34:00] around and he found where Milltown was
[1:34:02] and there was a little girl
[1:34:04] that got TB by an awful circumstance
[1:34:07] and she got a hold of a little book
[1:34:10] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:34:13] and forever and the prophet they would
[1:34:14] hand them these books out to build Faith
[1:34:16] to the people
[1:34:17] and she began to read this book
[1:34:19] and she was better written for TB for
[1:34:21] nine years
[1:34:23] and brother Brown was holding a Revival
[1:34:25] there and he was kept looking for that
[1:34:27] lost sheep he kept looking for that lost
[1:34:28] sheep now brother Brown wasn't there on
[1:34:30] his own accord
[1:34:31] God sent his Prophet down there the
[1:34:33] great Shepherd sent his Prophet all the
[1:34:36] way there
[1:34:37] for one lamb
[1:34:39] now there are many other baptisms and
[1:34:41] wonderful things that happened because
[1:34:43] of that but here Georgie Carter was her
[1:34:45] parents didn't believe in Divine Healing
[1:34:48] her church didn't believe in Divine
[1:34:50] Healing she was bedridden with TB for
[1:34:53] nine years
[1:34:55] and she still held the faith
[1:34:58] she rubbed the back of her of her
[1:35:00] headboard or bed post there
[1:35:02] in agony
[1:35:05] crying out to God to heal her
[1:35:09] the first time the brothers came to pray
[1:35:11] for her parents even left the house they
[1:35:13] didn't want to be around they finally
[1:35:14] agreed
[1:35:16] and then her mother got to pray and God
[1:35:18] run that imposter out of the area she
[1:35:21] was a sincere woman
[1:35:22] and as she was praying because she was
[1:35:24] sincere she's seen a shadow of Jesus on
[1:35:27] the wall with the beard
[1:35:29] and about that time she thought she
[1:35:31] didn't quite know what that was and when
[1:35:32] she got up here comes brother Branham to
[1:35:35] pray for Georgie Carter
[1:35:37] he found where she was and God showed
[1:35:40] him he was in the woods and he was
[1:35:41] praying for her and the pillar of fire
[1:35:43] appeared and he told him to go by the
[1:35:45] way
[1:35:46] of Carters
[1:35:49] that's what the angel of the Lord told
[1:35:50] him to do
[1:35:52] and he comes into the house and he said
[1:35:54] and I said sister Georgie the Lord Jesus
[1:35:57] Christ there behind the bed the little
[1:35:59] post of her bed she'd rubbed all the
[1:36:01] paint off
[1:36:02] and her church telling her the days of
[1:36:04] Miracles was passed she was born to be a
[1:36:06] child of God and there she was holding
[1:36:08] on to that promise
[1:36:10] God by his Mercy showed her vision and
[1:36:12] sent me down there that's where it was I
[1:36:15] said I know who you are you're that lamb
[1:36:19] that I saw caught up in this month a
[1:36:21] bunch of theology down here Hallelujah I
[1:36:23] said Georgie the Lord Jesus who you love
[1:36:26] and serve appeared to me up there on the
[1:36:28] hill a while ago in that same light that
[1:36:30] hung over the nail girl and he told me
[1:36:32] to come by this way I command the devil
[1:36:35] in the name of Jesus Christ to leave you
[1:36:37] I said rise up on your feet
[1:36:40] in front of witnesses and she stood up
[1:36:43] and she ran busted right out of that
[1:36:45] house and started blessing the grass and
[1:36:47] and playing the piano and she became his
[1:36:49] piano player in church
[1:36:52] and what does the Bible say about the
[1:36:53] miracles of Jesus that they the the the
[1:36:55] man who the miracle was done on was in
[1:36:58] their midst so they could say nothing
[1:37:01] so the miracle of Georgie Carter was in
[1:37:04] the midst of them and they could say
[1:37:05] nothing
[1:37:09] but yet God sent a prophet
[1:37:11] for a lamb
[1:37:15] and we could go on and on with the
[1:37:16] stories it even comes to mind about the
[1:37:18] Memphis woman she was a lamb crying out
[1:37:21] to God for her son
[1:37:24] now as I said serving the lord comes
[1:37:27] with a cost
[1:37:30] but let's not let's not be foolish here
[1:37:33] so does serving the devil
[1:37:37] let's not be naive
[1:37:39] serving God comes with a cost but
[1:37:41] serving the Devil comes with a terrible
[1:37:44] cost it's two different costs
[1:37:47] in Matthew 10 he that loveth father or
[1:37:50] mother more than me is not worthy of me
[1:37:53] and he that loveth son or daughter more
[1:37:55] than me is not worthy of me and he that
[1:37:58] and he that taketh not his cross and
[1:37:59] followeth after me is not worthy of me
[1:38:02] he that findeth his life shall lose it
[1:38:04] he that loseth his life for my sake
[1:38:06] shall find it
[1:38:08] in Luke 6 blessed are ye when men shall
[1:38:10] hate you and when they shall separate
[1:38:13] you from their company and shall
[1:38:15] reproach you and cast you out cast out
[1:38:17] your name as evil for the son of man's
[1:38:19] sake now watch this next verse
[1:38:21] because here you are you can be on the
[1:38:23] job or you can be at school and people
[1:38:26] are just you feel like they're talking
[1:38:27] behind your back and there's that girl
[1:38:28] with really long hair I don't know why
[1:38:30] she just don't do this that and the
[1:38:31] other I don't know why she don't wear
[1:38:33] pants and that's just so old-fashioned
[1:38:34] this that and the other and they're
[1:38:35] persecuting you
[1:38:38] now Jesus said that what happened but he
[1:38:40] didn't say give yourself a pity party he
[1:38:43] said blessed are you
[1:38:45] and watch verse 23 he says Rejoice ye in
[1:38:48] that day
[1:38:50] do you see the difference between the
[1:38:51] human mind and the mind of God you come
[1:38:53] home after a day at the work and the
[1:38:54] boss has been giving you a hard time
[1:38:56] because you wouldn't go on a sociable
[1:38:57] drink or maybe you wouldn't look at that
[1:39:00] something that maybe he wanted you to
[1:39:01] look at and he's just giving you such a
[1:39:02] hard time
[1:39:04] and in your mind you come home and
[1:39:06] you're just worn out from the
[1:39:07] persecution
[1:39:09] but then the mind of God said Rejoice ye
[1:39:11] in that day
[1:39:13] and leap for joy
[1:39:18] for leap for Joy for behold your reward
[1:39:21] is great in heaven
[1:39:24] for in like manner they didn't in like
[1:39:27] manner did their Prophet their fathers
[1:39:28] unto the prophets
[1:39:30] God will not in no wise be in debt to
[1:39:33] any man
[1:39:34] that's words of the prophet
[1:39:37] God won't be debted to any man if you
[1:39:39] don't if you have did that for God
[1:39:41] forsaken all God will repay you a
[1:39:43] thousand fold right God will pay it back
[1:39:45] you forsake the things of the world and
[1:39:47] the world and the things of the world
[1:39:48] and God will repay you so many times
[1:39:50] he says how many is a witness of that
[1:39:53] here tonight
[1:39:54] we all know that God will repay you know
[1:39:57] this message came with a cost too
[1:40:00] we can never forget that
[1:40:02] sometimes we listen to a tape and we get
[1:40:04] blessed and we're on the Mountaintop and
[1:40:06] it helps us through our Valley praise
[1:40:08] God we turn the tape off and go eat
[1:40:09] supper and spend time with our families
[1:40:10] but we don't realize behind that tape
[1:40:14] the friends he lost the demons he fought
[1:40:18] them hours he fasted the hours he prayed
[1:40:21] the hours he studied
[1:40:23] it came at a cost you know imagine
[1:40:25] fathers imagine this you know we
[1:40:27] sometimes look look at our children
[1:40:28] we're like good night where did the time
[1:40:30] go
[1:40:31] you know I seriously thought the Lord
[1:40:34] was going to come before Rebecca was
[1:40:35] ever in kindergarten
[1:40:36] and she's in seventh grade now
[1:40:38] but you think and time just goes by so
[1:40:40] brother Branham when he would have come
[1:40:42] home he'd be gone and that's right
[1:40:43] before our eyes how much more if you'd
[1:40:45] be gone for months at a time he'd come
[1:40:47] home and his own kids would be scared of
[1:40:49] him
[1:40:50] wouldn't even know who he was how that
[1:40:51] would just break your heart
[1:40:55] but if preaching this message came at a
[1:40:58] cost so we're living it
[1:41:01] but you have to determine in your heart
[1:41:03] you've got to count the cost
[1:41:06] that it's worth it
[1:41:08] because to reap life eternal
[1:41:12] and Heaven's Joy
[1:41:14] all the trials and everything that we
[1:41:16] face in this life and all the sickness
[1:41:17] and everybody has their own trials God
[1:41:19] custom tailors
[1:41:21] does that make you feel special God
[1:41:23] custom tailors your trials for your
[1:41:25] personality and for what he needs out of
[1:41:27] you
[1:41:30] and he and what he can trust in you
[1:41:33] so just because you're going you feel
[1:41:34] like you're going through a much harder
[1:41:36] trial than your brother and sister don't
[1:41:37] mean that God must not love me as much
[1:41:39] no
[1:41:40] take it as a compliment God you must
[1:41:42] really trust me
[1:41:45] you must really love me
[1:41:47] he would not put that trial on me if he
[1:41:49] knew he couldn't do it
[1:41:52] there's
[1:41:54] story in the scriptures
[1:41:57] about a woman in an alabaster box
[1:42:03] her name was Mary Mary of Bethany
[1:42:06] and in Luke chapter 10 he records it and
[1:42:08] it says now it came to pass as they went
[1:42:11] that he entered into a certain Village
[1:42:13] and a certain woman named Martha
[1:42:14] received him into her house and she had
[1:42:16] a sister called Mary
[1:42:18] which also sat at Jesus's feet and heard
[1:42:21] his word but Martha was cumbered about
[1:42:23] with much serving and came to him and
[1:42:25] said Lord just thou not care that my
[1:42:27] sister has left me to serve alone bitter
[1:42:29] therefore that she helped me and Jesus
[1:42:31] answered and said Martha Martha Thou Art
[1:42:33] careful and troubled about many things
[1:42:35] but one thing is needful
[1:42:37] and Mary had chosen the good part
[1:42:41] that good part which shall not be taken
[1:42:44] away from her
[1:42:46] Mary was convinced of who Jesus was
[1:42:50] she was convinced that he was a messiah
[1:42:54] so she put all of her worth
[1:42:57] all of her savings
[1:43:02] into an alabaster box
[1:43:05] and she realized
[1:43:07] that all that she could put in it
[1:43:10] he was worth it
[1:43:13] she sold out to everything else
[1:43:17] she forsook everything else
[1:43:22] and put all of her investment
[1:43:25] into one great Pearl
[1:43:29] of great price called an alabaster box
[1:43:32] and she paid top dollar she wasn't
[1:43:34] looking for a sale this is no offense to
[1:43:36] anyone please don't take offense I'm
[1:43:38] making a spiritual analogy here
[1:43:41] we all love getting good deals
[1:43:44] and and shopping sales and things okay
[1:43:46] I'm talking spiritual
[1:43:48] she was willing to put everything that
[1:43:51] she had
[1:43:51] into one event
[1:43:57] Matthew records it
[1:43:59] in Matthew 26 verse 6 now when Jesus was
[1:44:02] in Bethany in the house of Simon the
[1:44:04] leper that came unto him a woman having
[1:44:06] an alabaster box a very precious
[1:44:09] ointment
[1:44:10] and poured it on his head as he sat at
[1:44:13] meat
[1:44:14] and when his disciples saw it they had
[1:44:16] indignation saying to what purpose is
[1:44:18] this waste for this ointment might have
[1:44:20] been sold for much and given to the poor
[1:44:22] when Jesus understood it he said unto
[1:44:24] them why trouble ye the woman
[1:44:26] for she hath wrought a good work upon me
[1:44:28] for in that shift pour this ointment for
[1:44:31] it for ye have the poor always with you
[1:44:33] but ye but me had not always
[1:44:36] for in that she had poured the ointment
[1:44:38] on my body she did it for my burial
[1:44:41] she understood
[1:44:43] there Jesus was saying I'm going to
[1:44:45] follow my hands of sinful man I've got
[1:44:46] to pay the price I'm going to come back
[1:44:49] and here you have a woman who sits at
[1:44:52] the feet of Jesus
[1:44:54] and she hears all this and she receives
[1:44:56] it and she's aware
[1:44:58] that she's got to do something
[1:45:02] for verily I say unto you wheresoever
[1:45:05] this gospel shall be preached in the
[1:45:07] whole world
[1:45:08] including Elkton Virginia
[1:45:11] there shall also this that this woman
[1:45:14] hath done be told for a memorial of her
[1:45:18] now John 12 also records her the same
[1:45:21] event she also poured oil on his feet
[1:45:25] and it was very costly and the Bible
[1:45:27] says that the house was filled with the
[1:45:30] odor of this ointment
[1:45:32] now when you look in the order of the
[1:45:34] scriptures there in Matthew 26 you'll
[1:45:36] find that this event actually happens
[1:45:37] between the Jews we're sitting there
[1:45:39] trying to figure out how we can get rid
[1:45:40] of Jesus we've got to kill him too many
[1:45:42] people are leaving our churches we've
[1:45:43] got to get rid of him
[1:45:45] and then on this other side you had
[1:45:47] Judas who actually said you know what he
[1:45:49] snuck away and said I'll be the one to
[1:45:51] do it I'm going to find opportunity and
[1:45:53] I'll betray Jesus to you for the for and
[1:45:55] he coming to tid with the price in
[1:45:57] between
[1:45:58] that rejection and that Judas spirit
[1:46:03] you have a woman here
[1:46:05] they gave everything she had
[1:46:08] to pour the oil on Jesus
[1:46:11] she counted the cost
[1:46:14] the prophet said see this woman was so
[1:46:16] grateful that her sins were forgiven
[1:46:18] until she spent all of her money that
[1:46:22] she had
[1:46:25] and took an alabaster box and broke it
[1:46:28] and poured the oil and just odored the
[1:46:30] room with fine smell of this myrrh that
[1:46:32] she had anointed him for his death
[1:46:34] now see she did the service
[1:46:38] not knowing what she was doing
[1:46:41] she was inspired
[1:46:43] but she was so grateful to God
[1:46:48] he was worth it
[1:46:52] Jesus was worth breaking this box for
[1:46:58] it was a very precious ointment
[1:47:01] because remember once it was broken
[1:47:04] There's No Going Back
[1:47:06] she spent all of her money that she had
[1:47:08] on this one single event
[1:47:12] and when she broke that Alabaster Box
[1:47:15] sister Whitney the oil could not be
[1:47:18] returned back in the alabaster box
[1:47:21] it could not be it could not go and be
[1:47:23] returned for a refund
[1:47:26] this was not a pretended believer
[1:47:29] she got everything she had she invested
[1:47:32] it in One Moment In His presence
[1:47:35] she seized her moment
[1:47:38] and she not only bought the alabaster
[1:47:40] box to say look what I did
[1:47:43] she broke it there was no going back
[1:47:48] no matter the price or quality of the
[1:47:50] oil if it's not broken it doesn't do any
[1:47:53] good
[1:47:55] to have all the most expensive oh my
[1:47:57] alabaster box and the oil is so pricey
[1:48:00] brother Gabriel it costs so much let me
[1:48:02] let me show you the receipt look how
[1:48:04] much I paid look what I did for the
[1:48:06] kingdom of God
[1:48:08] but it's not broken
[1:48:10] it's not in service
[1:48:14] the body of Jesus had all my healing had
[1:48:17] all your healing had all your Holy Ghost
[1:48:19] had all your comfort had everything you
[1:48:21] have need of
[1:48:23] but if it wasn't broken
[1:48:26] what benefit would it have done you
[1:48:30] it had to be broken and just as the
[1:48:32] aroma of that oil filled the room now
[1:48:34] the aroma of his Spirit fills our lives
[1:48:39] and people can come by and they can get
[1:48:40] a refreshing in your atmosphere
[1:48:44] because of the aroma of the spirit of
[1:48:48] God that fills your life
[1:48:50] they can feel the love of God in your
[1:48:52] life
[1:48:54] the word of God has all the promises the
[1:48:57] full truth the rapturing faith
[1:48:58] everything we have need of from Earth to
[1:49:00] glory is right here
[1:49:01] but it was sealed with Seven Seals
[1:49:06] they had to be broken
[1:49:09] for the book to be open
[1:49:13] and now that life that Aroma is now
[1:49:16] broken in your private study that Aroma
[1:49:19] is now broken that Alabaster Box is
[1:49:21] broken and it begins to fill your life
[1:49:24] yes thank you Lord
[1:49:28] it had to be unbroken to unleash their
[1:49:30] power and potential
[1:49:33] may my Alabaster Box as I'm closing
[1:49:38] may my Alabaster Box be broken to anoint
[1:49:41] the head of my savior
[1:49:45] to refresh him
[1:49:48] may I spend all that I have
[1:49:52] all my time my effort my energy for a
[1:49:55] Divine Divine Purpose to bring him a
[1:49:59] refreshment
[1:50:01] when others won't may I
[1:50:05] if he needs praise may I give it
[1:50:10] if he needs somebody to believe his word
[1:50:13] in the midst of this troubled and dark
[1:50:15] lady asea
[1:50:18] May It Be Me
[1:50:21] if he needs someone to be thankful in
[1:50:24] their heart for what he's done for them
[1:50:27] Lord let it be me
[1:50:33] he doesn't just love me
[1:50:35] because I love him
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:39] he loved me when I didn't love him
[1:50:43] he loved me when I was thinking of him
[1:50:46] he loved me when I didn't want him he
[1:50:48] loved me while I was yet in sin
[1:50:51] that's the kind of a loving father that
[1:50:53] we have
[1:50:55] listened to our feet
[1:50:58] when I had no thoughts toward him
[1:51:00] musicians can come
[1:51:02] when I had no thoughts toward him
[1:51:05] he already loved me
[1:51:08] he already counted the cost
[1:51:11] but for the foundation of the world
[1:51:14] and he believed that my soul and that
[1:51:17] your soul was worth it
[1:51:21] may we this evening
[1:51:24] sure we've we've given our hearts to the
[1:51:26] Lord we've given our lives to the Lord
[1:51:28] and if you haven't
[1:51:31] I pray that maybe even while this while
[1:51:32] this service was going on while the word
[1:51:34] was going forth that you have been
[1:51:36] counting the cost within your own mind
[1:51:39] within your own soul
[1:51:41] because remember the Rich Young Ruler he
[1:51:43] also counted the cost
[1:51:45] he was presented with eternal life and
[1:51:47] he counted well if I actually see Jesus
[1:51:51] said give all that you have give it to
[1:51:53] the poor and come and follow me
[1:51:55] he knew that's where that man's weakness
[1:51:56] was
[1:51:58] and that rich young ruler was not
[1:52:01] willing
[1:52:03] when he counted the cost he was not
[1:52:04] willing to pay the price
[1:52:07] for eternal life
[1:52:10] and chapters later we find him he lifted
[1:52:12] up his eyes in hell
[1:52:14] but may we be identified not with the
[1:52:16] Rich Young Ruler
[1:52:18] but may we have to be identified
[1:52:21] with Mary
[1:52:23] when Jesus is sitting with dirty feet
[1:52:25] may we be like that woman that came and
[1:52:28] poured oil on his feet kiss him
[1:52:30] and wipe him with the hairs of her head
[1:52:34] may we break our Alabaster Box
[1:52:39] in his presence
[1:52:42] and give him
[1:52:44] our all
[1:52:46] let's bow our heads to him
[1:52:48] the gracious Heavenly Father Lord we
[1:52:51] come before you in prayer
[1:52:53] Lord we thank you for these moments Lord
[1:52:55] Jesus
[1:52:56] Lord we thank you for this truth father
[1:52:58] Lord that we have
[1:53:00] we thank you Lord for your word we thank
[1:53:01] you Lord that you weren't willing Lord
[1:53:03] that we should be left without a savior
[1:53:05] Lord when you had that conference father
[1:53:08] Lord all your Angels were gathered about
[1:53:10] they were standing on the rocks and they
[1:53:12] were just on the Edge Edge of their
[1:53:15] seats as it were to see what would you
[1:53:16] do what are you going to do the sins of
[1:53:19] the world are being laid are at your
[1:53:21] feet are you going to take them on you
[1:53:24] are you going to pay the ultimate price
[1:53:29] it wasn't just a price of crucifixion
[1:53:31] and just mortal death it was the price
[1:53:34] of hell
[1:53:35] it was the price of Agony and dying with
[1:53:38] all the sins of the world on you
[1:53:42] and you said nevertheless not my will
[1:53:44] but thine be done
[1:53:48] and then Lord Jesus we see
[1:53:51] before this event takes place
[1:53:54] there was a woman a type of the church
[1:53:57] who sat at your feet and heard the words
[1:53:59] of Jesus and believed everything she
[1:54:01] realized that you are the Messiah she
[1:54:03] realized that you were worth it
[1:54:06] so she went and spent all of her living
[1:54:10] so she could do you a service
[1:54:13] father I pray that you take us under
[1:54:16] your wings just now Lord I pray that if
[1:54:19] there's something that we can offer you
[1:54:21] maybe that we've held back before
[1:54:24] maybe a bit more time in prayer maybe a
[1:54:26] bit more time and worship maybe some
[1:54:29] maybe a heart of gratitude for what
[1:54:31] you've done for us
[1:54:33] Lord I pray o God that in the name of
[1:54:35] Jesus
[1:54:36] that you help us Lord Jesus to break
[1:54:38] that Alabaster Box Lord and minister to
[1:54:41] you may we do you a service by
[1:54:44] inspiration because it becometh us to
[1:54:46] fulfill all righteousness
[1:54:49] father God we also pray Lord I pray that
[1:54:52] in the name of Jesus if there's someone
[1:54:54] here Lord Jesus or maybe even by way of
[1:54:56] Internet that hasn't made that that
[1:54:58] commitment that hasn't forsaken all to
[1:55:01] follow you
[1:55:02] Lord we heard tonight Lord that you're
[1:55:04] even just a great Shepherd Lord and you
[1:55:06] left you flocked and you're out looking
[1:55:08] for that one thank you Lord Jesus for
[1:55:11] being such a loving God thank you Lord
[1:55:14] Jesus for being so merciful to us

[1:55:18] remainder of this service into your
[1:55:19] hands we give you all the praise honor
[1:55:21] and glory and the lovely name of Jesus
