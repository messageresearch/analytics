in a special way today minister to us and anoint the speaker touch his body Lord I pray that you would do a work for us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen you can be seated brother Matt mlar sent me a note the other day and I sent it to brother Donnie and brother Tim this morning that note says I tried to throw in the towel and God threw it back and said wipe your face you're almost there there but there's more work to do I thought that was so phenomenal I think it was Spurgeon said this courage is not having the strength to go on it is going on when you don't have the strength amen I remember and I'll just share this with you I remember when they were pulling me off of a ventilator after i' been there 3 weeks from the burning and so my lungs were burnt and my face was burnt my arms were burnt I'd been on a ventilator for 3 weeks and it was doing the burning it was doing the breathing for me and they were pulling me off and they say that's the time to when it's the most biggest struggle and they were pulling me off of the ventilator and your body has to begin to take over again because it gets attached to that ventilator and they were pulling me off of the ventilator and there was a lady named Debbie and her name sticks out to me because this this stuck with me and she began to scream in my ear fight for life amen Fight For Life fight for life and that's always stuck with me you got to fight for life I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all of them right unto all of them that love his appearing in Philippians chapter 3 and verse 13 Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing that I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before notice these next words I press towards the mark of the for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jes Jesus you got to fight for it in Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 29 he giveth power to the faint and into them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and young men shall utterly F fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint could we read that verse together today but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint my favorite scripture Isaiah chter 54 and verse verse 16 behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for the work and I have created the waser to destroy next scripture No Weapon no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in the judge shal thou con condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord amen I have three small quotes that I want to share with you I'm so glad that a man can so completely serve god Till the devil don't know what to do with him I want to be that man amen right brother Abram said the devil hates me and I know he hates you too and he's my enemy but as long as God is my friend I don't have no fear of him can I read it again for you the devil hates me and I know he hates you too and he's my enemy I love this next sentence but as long as God's my friend I have no fear of him right this he this is another quote have faith in God oh my how the devil has to recognize the supreme authority of Jesus Christ not me he hates me he don't have to mind me but he has to mind who I represent he has to mind who sent me here on that's not just for brother brandom and it's not just for me it's for you too Psalm chapter 23 is very familiar the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures and he leadth me beside of the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake and yet though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with all and my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever Revelations 12 and verse 7 if you'll turn there with me they'll have it on the board and there was war in heaven oh and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against the angels and Prevail not amen neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him I want you to understand tonight I want you to understand this the angels that fight for us has fought before right and they whipped the devil on so the devil that you fight has been whipped by the angels that are taking care of you Bo buil and I heard a loud voice in heaven saying now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Saints for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuse them before our God day and night am I want you to read this next verse with me and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death every one of us have a story am I preaching to the radio every one of us have a story every one of us have a battle brother random said when you became a Christian you entered a battle right that's right but let me just know we know what what side that we are on Amen when you're in a battle there's flags that are raised that's right to let the enemy know who we represent come if we could raise that Christian flag and the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ I want the devil to know that's right I am not on his side and he is defeated and I am here to represent who defeated him now a contest is a test of strength where we have a test of strength now I find it very interesting that our Prophet brother brandham was a boxer and he never was defeated amen now we too have a battle we're in a battle with the world the world is at War they're at war with one another now Champions have to be tested that's why you and I are tested every week am we're tested every week now but remember God will not allow more than what you can handle that's right that's right are you with me he will allow you to come right up against the line but he will not allow more right right and remember before you can be tested the enemy has to go and get permission from God brother Ron I'm going through a horrible test remember God gave permission that's right he gave permission and listen if God gave permission for you to go through the battle he knows you will win hallu just think about some of the messages that brother renam spoke about war spoken word is the Original Seed all through that sermon he begins to describe of the seed that came from God and what side that you're on all the way back to the Garden then from Heaven Lucifer was cast out brother Baron preaches sermons like wisdom versus Faith then he speaks sermons like things that are to be I'm not going to name them all that's a theme to give you strength to overcome then he's preaches sermons like how can I overcome sermons like he that is in you the greatest battle that's ever fought now brother Andrew came to the end of of the sermon last night and he began to name some of these sermons now I want you to understand brother brandham and many of these cases were not standing before friendly audiences he was not standing he was not standing in a message Church brother branam never preached other than his own audience that wasn't getting it but he never preached to a group like we have here today that believes the message of the hour Hallelujah so he stood against spiritual enemies that stood there before him like the blind man that he prayed for and in India to where that those those religious Powers were coming against him the Witchcraft was coming against him and if you remember after the vision that he had he challenged the those Gods he turned and challenged those Gods if your God so great come healing are you come healing and remember he became blind because he was worshiping their God that's right right but the God had accepted the challenge the Lord Jesus Christ had accepted the challenge and and I want you to understand he knew because of the vision that's almost like cheating he was looking in the future in a few minutes this man's going to have sight just like I have sight amen remember what he told brother bisco he said I looked at him and said his his hair was was dark but then in the vision I saw it was gray and his eyes were clear his eyes were good and he says I knew I knew by seeing the vision in his future he was going to see oh man you're talking about challenge listen when he preaches the church ages and goes all the way back through the church ages he is actually exposing what the devil did all the way down through the church ages that's why hate the devil hates this message cause it exposes who he is and what he does and then when the seals re believe were released it caused an invincible Army right to be released in this day right well who is that Invincible Army around the world congregations like you now listen who are we fighting against the enemy of this age right the devil that tries to take you out into Le oosa and every one of us are at war with it amen that's right brother Brandon we actually have this in my office he said I was going into a baseball foot ball stadium one time and he said I saw this little thing hanging on the wall that always struck me amen and it said it's not the size of the dog that is in the fight it's the size of the fight that's in the darkg I I just I I just I want to share this with you there was a guy that was named M kzdc from from South America he's a little bitty guy he's about 5 foot tall and I may not have his name exactly right and Connie you can help me I don't know but anyway you talking about a power packed preacher and he use this statement and he he came to brother to brother Henry greens at that time and then he came to our church and spoke many times and and he he would say he would use this quote and he said dinamite comes in small packages and one time he was out on the field doing Mission work and his mother had died and and they they somehow got a hold of him and and told him your mother has died and he said well you hold her and don't embomb her until I get home and so when he got home he be to pray over his mother that's now been dead for a few days and he began to pray over her and as he prays over her she she raises up and said what are you doing home listen my God can do anything I want to ask you how big is your God on the only thing that limits God Is Us am that's right are you with me my God created the universe are you with me and out of the chaos of the Earth he created a perfect Eden right well how big is your god I heard and I've got it in my notes job when God came to job God did not talk about him in the condition that he was in God don't come to you and have a pity party with you listen you should not expect God to have a pity party with you that's right because your God is a big God and so he reminds you to build your faith that you can walk through your storm Amen brother random says and sir we would see Jesus you never judge a man by how big his hands is and how wide his shoulders is I've heard you them say oh isn't he a man and I've seen men that weighed 200 lb that didn't have an ounce of man in them just for your knowledge brother brandom never weighed over 150 pounds he said you don't measure a man by his size that's a brute you measure him by his character there there never was a a greater character than the man Jesus Christ amen amen would it be okay for Andrew to pray for me just now would that be okay and I'm sorry to stop for a moment amen amen is that all right will you pray with Andrew amen father we just come before you right now Lord you see our pastor Lord Jesus Lord you see the fress of his body father Lord all that he's battled God we just know that the enemy has tried to block the visitation over and over again I pray that you would bring strength to our brother Ron just now that you would release the Holy Ghost upon his life to strengthen him and anoint him in a special way father you just allow the nerves in his body to be able to be at peace just now bring healing around him May the mighty Angel just up hold him just now father we commit this service to you father and your glory in the name of Jesus Christ we accept and believe what you're doing just now amen amen and amen thank you Andrew amen amen sorry brother brah said every son that is born of God has to be tried and chastened he said I remember when mine came or or my greatest hour he said when a man is born again there's a little spot like a size of a fingernail that God injects into him a system and and it falls into his heart and there it anchors I love this and then Satan makes him prove it and then Satan makes him prove it and if a if it ain't there you're gone I'm thankful to that seed of God that is constantly holding on to you listen it's not you holding on to God it's God holding on to you brother man said God doesn't make anything that perishes God is eternal and therefore this life that we are now living is only reflecting what is ahead of us the real one cannot die the body cannot perish the life cannot be taken and therefore the scriptures is right when it says that we have everlasting life I want you to think about that we have everlasting life we have eternal life and we shall never die Satan did you hear that let's just might as well remind him right now Satan did you hear that we shall never [Applause] die when you're born again you become a part of God and you are forever for eternity never to fail you're a you are a part of God you're his son I don't believe that we can put enough emphasis on that brother Ron you're preaching on a battle well I'm just taking a few moments to tell you what side we're on it's extremely important what side you're on listen if I was in a battle I wouldn't have a Russian and I don't mean anything toward the Russian people but if we're in a battle I've going to have the United States uniform on right and this battle I'm going to have God's uniform on brother Ron I'm in a horrible battle what uniform are you fighting with [Music] Hallelujah Abraham didn't praise God for the progress he praised God for the promise hallu I'm not looking at my everyday Affair of my fight I'm looking at the promise when he took him up on a hill when when Satan took Jesus up on going to heal and set him down he rebuked him again with the word and defeated Satan with the word of God showing that that's the what the weakest of Christian can defeat Satan with thus saeth the Lord I could preach here for just a few moments I want you to understand if you feel like you're the weakest Christian in this church are the weakest Christian on the internet I want you to understand you I want you to put your finger on your chest you can defeat Satan anywhere anytime under any condition that's right with thus saith the Lord brother BR said be determined I think that's a quite a statement be determined listen when you're determined there ain't nobody in this world can talk you out of being here did you get it be determined be determined all right I'm going to win be determined I'm going to win don't be defeated you heard that glass half empty half full listen a negative attitude will never get you anywhere weary will never get you anywhere brother Ron I'm just so worried about everything it'll never never do you no good right it'll never do you no good well I'm worried about this and I'm worried about that I'm worried about my children give your children to [Applause] God you can't help your children give them to God you commit them to God God will take care of them come on come on somebody ought to say Amen now I want you to claim your promise right here in this service we don't have to wait 10 weeks 2 years 15 years I'm claiming my children right here I want all of my granddaughters to stand up just a second I want all my granddaughters to stand up just a second all right there we go four four I don't just pray for them I pray for their husbands amen I I'm gonna get it for you I don't just pray for them I pray for their husbands well brother Ron they're not old enough to have husbands they're H they're their husbands are growing up their husbands are going to be my grandsons in-laws I want real Christians real men I don't want some lay on a sin that is not determined to overcome I want real men I want you to understand it's hard for us to understand this when God plac a seed inside of you there's not a microscope can find that it's not a microscope can find it but when he placed that seed in you before the foundation of the world and then gave you the Holy Ghost God puts his seal on you not to lose you over and over and over again when you find people that are in and out of church well I'm going to serve him today and and then they they're here for a while and then they're gone and they're here for a while then they're gone they they don't have it they don't have it but listen when you get the Holy Ghost it seals you tell the day of your Redemption and then you got everything that you need for life's journey listen it's more than just a quote from the prophet right it's more than just a quote you've got everything you need but what is in that Jesus himself it's not some 12E education it's not some theology right it's not some intellectual ability right you got the Life of Christ and listen when you have your friend gets the Holy Ghost you know it right you know it you know it you knew it when he got it he knew it when you got it right that's right are you with me amen now brother randam said this and this may take a minute for this quote but he said you know your enemy and you trained for the contest and you're going to have to you're going to have to meet him because you're going to meet him and you'll know him and you'll know what his strength is and when you train for this contest you know you're going to meet him for that's one thing for sure you're going to meet him right and so you train for the contest and know now training for the contest is just like a boxer his enemy he's going to meet you out there in a contest to fight and a real good fighter usually knows and studies his opponent he studies his licks and he knows where he fights for and whether he leans forward or hangs back fights right-handed left-handed he studies all of this and then if he's good and smart fighter he gets him a sparring partner that'll fight just like his opponent fights for he'll know all the licks when it gets you to that place and I think a very good thing for a Christian to to do and now if you want to start training start at John 3:16 the Golden Rule right out with that and that you'll get on with the floor and and when you're trained for The Knockout punches because you're going to have to use them everybody knows that you have to train to hit your enemy now this next statement is important God God uses his word right you must remember that God uses his word to defeat his enemy well brother Ron that's everybody knows that well how much do you read your Bible how much could you say that I've got memorized then if we got an enemy and we can't fight with this we can't fight him with our strength of our arms and our legs and with our Brilliance of our mind the only way that we can defeat him is defeat him by the word of God well you say brother Ron I can't memorize scripture well that's no problem that's no problem but read it right right read it how do I get closer to God brother brandom would say it over and over read your Bible and pray I can't read well God's fixed that for you you can listen listen there's a lot of preachers that have been in the message that couldn't read and would have their wives to read the scripture to them and from that they was phenomenal preachers right phenomenal preachers listen in the message we don't have phds and llds and DDS come on what's a DD dead dog now if God could think or could give his people anything better to defeat the enemy he would have done it so as we always when a man makes a decision that's the best that there is he never ever Alters his decision we know this God doesn't change his mind God doesn't change his mind now you say well brother R I went to the Baptist Church the Methodist Church I went to Pentecostal churches what's the difference about you we don't have a board meeting and we decide what we're going to allow this coming year on we're going to allow women preachers and it's against the word we're going to allow women to cut their hair but it's against the word we're going to allow Jezebel and it's against the word we're going to allow men and it's against the [Applause] word are you with me now listen let me just say we want to stay right on the word I want to remind you of this and now we're more than conquerors we're just walk right into the into it as an inheritance more than a conqueror we're dealing with a defeated enemy I I know this is simple but if you can remind the enemy he's defeated you got him whipped you got him whipped before he walks out of the locker room that's right you got him whipped before he comes to your house before you get out of bed in the morning he's already scared of what you can do today listen your prayers that's right shake the kingdom of Hell your pray right my mother she was a whisper prayer she prayed you remember this when when she prayed she whispered but her whisper shook the kingdom of hell my mother took checks and put it in her Bible you've seen many of them she took checks and wrote those checks out for the things that she needed it was phenomenal the things that took place out of a whispering sck is's prayer but brother Ron I'm a lady let me just say this to you even you have power with God that's right that's right listen we don't have a defeated women Society here you're a daughter of God when not believe the sign mess took place they talked about how hard our sisters had it and I asked my wife have you ever felt abused in this home have you ever felt abused have I ever abused you I've never laid a hand on her I know better I sleep too solid cuz Miss Homer would kill me in my sleep I'm not like my dad my dad always said we never had an argument but they had intense Fellowship that's good a that's good are you with me listen God said brother onon but women failed and women women are the Lesser where'd you get that come on you didn't get that from Brother brandom come on we understand how what brother brandom said about the sisters but he didn't put you down the garden is what did all that kind of thing but I want you to understand you've got power with God don't get critical right there don't go look up a bunch of quotes right there I want you to understand our sisters come on are some of the most powerful ladies in the whole [Applause] world now brother brandom said this he said when I started training for boxing when I got into professional fighting they used to be a trainer and they called him 6C Smith and I said six why do you have to do me that way he said you just knocked the breath out of me and man went I went Plum over the ropes and come right out of there and it almost them chairs and Len to broke my back on them and he said laughed at me and said that'll do you good yeah do me good how can it do me good you're going to kill me and he said' look Billy I don't care how you physically fit you are your body's got to be able to stand and come back right quick you got to if you can take the punch a hard punch your body's not used to coming back you'll lay there and take the C out but if your body's used to taking it then come back every time you hit it that shocks your blood it runs it right back to the heart and said if you do that then your body is used to coming back quick and when you get knocked down brother BR snaps his finger and you'll get right back on your feet again Hall that don't mean a thing when you get knocked down up on your feet again quick and and six second Smith said you may hate me now but you'll appreciate me when you get out there in the ring I just want to add this you may hate us preachers now you may hate us now but one day you'll appreciate us [Applause] brother B says you can't Satan you can't hold them no more they're God's children right now I'm bringing them right before you you have to take your hand off of their life they belong to God now and I claimed them for him I claimed them as trophies do you hear what he said I claimed them as trophies of Christ's love at crowy I challenge you to a debate it's good a brother Bram said I challenge you to a debate you don't have any legal power you don't have you don't have power over them you didn't have it in the first place you was only bluffing them come on I'll just tell you there's been times where all of us have been bluffed right Christ stripped you of everything that you had at Calvary he stripped you of every Power that you ever had and you're nothing but a bluff now our God is not dead but he's alive and he has the keys to death hell in the grave and he conquered everything that Satan thought he owned right he won the war more and he said I have power to lay my life down and I have power to take it up again so let's remind oursel here we're serving a living God right that ought to make you smile a little bit we're serving a living God we are not serving a historical God that's righten we're not serving a god of 2,000 years ago or even 60 or 70 you know I listen to the prayer lines brother brandom is operating in those prayer lines and sometimes we think we get this thought I wish I'd have been there Heather you ever get that thought sister Heather you ever get that thought I wish I'd have been there I think we we all we all have that thought but if we could only get realization that the same God is here that's right the same God is here sister Sue called me yesterday because all that was going on and she said brother Ron will you pray you know what I did I prayed because I knew I couldn't do anything to help her but who I represent can get everybody that's working there anoint them what about your situation are you with me sure you can pray but when you call the preacher say will you pray for me I got a situation going on it's happening right now we got a living God that's all over the world he knows your situation am I want you to understand he takes your case he has never been in a crisis Moses and them were in a crisis Jonah was in a crisis Rahab was in a crisis and me and you've been in a crisis but he's never failed he's never forgot you brother Ron I I'm in a rehab condition I'm in a nursing home he hasn't forgot you right he hasn't forgot you far as I know Sister Hoover in this shirt stayed in the nursing home longer than anybody sister Terry how long was Sister sister Hoover in a nursing home8 years when we had her funeral we had a phenomenal amount of employees that came here at her funeral she may have been in a nursing home but she still lived the life come on it is are you getting it now are you getting it so God don't forget us God ever makes a decision he never changes his mind Psalms 103 and I I'm going to I'm going I'm gonna quit with this Psalms 103 and verse one I want you to read this with me because this scripture is to every one of us bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not his benefits his mind's still very good I find all of that phenomenal he may not remember what he had for breakfast this morning but he can quote the scriptures with me verse three I'm sorry who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases do you believe that verse four who redeemeth thy life from destruction who C thee with loving kindness and tender Mercy verse five who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed Like an Eagle thank you Lord why did you read that verse last because you got a roast you've got tenderloin Isn't it nice that God made food to tastes good you know you think about it for a little while you you could have been having to eat trees you could have been having to eat grass but God loved you so much you can eat potatoes with butter in [Applause] them I'm not going to your salad you'll got have to do that all by yourself he can make coconut cake for you come on brother Ron is that important Elijah was under a juniper tree he was under a juniper tree he was wore out he was he was literally depressed in where he was at and God called the Ang Ang with the softest hands to massage his brow brother Doug you must have been part of this department he called the best cooks in heaven Hallelujah why'd you pick out brother Doug he's over top of a lot of cooks and in heaven there's somewhere there's some in incredible Cooks I just say this now Jim bab that was his favorite quote he loved the fact that somewhere there was angels that cooked Jim bab's my buddy I'm talking about you so he got the best cooks in heaven and said make him cakes and listen he was so tired and the anointing left him he was so wore out until he ate those cakes fed to him by angels and he went right back to sleep I got news for you if angels come to my house today and they feed me cakes I'm probably not going back to sleep I'm going to shout and shout and shout and Shout Shout brother R why did you end on this scripture there's a day coming where we're going to set at the marriage supper of the Lamb together and the Gates of Hell have not prevailed against us everything that hell had he throwed against you right and it did not Prevail but we overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony God bless you [Applause] Hallelujah want you greet your neighbor and say I'm going to sit there I'm going to be there I'm going to be there and brother Ray Mike orders sings a song I don't know if he sings it anymore but he's going to sing a song said we made it we made it you may have a struggle now and you may be

healing great is fall down I'm not afraid I'm [Music] not Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord Jesus we come before you today Lord in your presence Lord Lord we realize that the Gates of Hell have certainly set themsel against us Lord in many a way we have come through the battles oh god of our flesh we've come through the battles in the spiritual realm on all things we see the gates of hell that are set there before us Lord a prophet would teach us that that's the strongest part of the city it's in Gates but not just a man but our Lord stood there and you took men like brother Matthew brother William myself brother Ron some men that were going to follow you may not look like the strongest and the greatest of men in the crowd but you took them and said now this is what I'm going to tell you boys that the Gates of Hell will not be able to Prevail against you father we realize Lord Jesus that we are in a moment in time where the Gates of Hell have set themselves against the Bride of Jesus Christ we realize father that we have received a revelation from on high that has placed us in a position that we realize that no weapon that is formed against the Bride of Jesus Christ it can scream it can holler it can talk about how powerful that it is but it ain't powerful enough to stop us so father We join our faith together Lord you know that we realize that in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let everything be established and father we recognize you as our healer we recognize the moment that we are in is a supernatural predestinated moment so father we just speak into the atmosphere of the things that we've receive right now in your name little bride I'm going to ask you just to turn your mouth loose just for a minute no matter who's beside you I want you to say I want you to say what you want I want you to say say what you want to receive I want you to be very diligent in this not just positive thinking here but I want you to put the word of God behind your lips say it is written I believe therefore I speak Healing Rain it's falling now healing rain is fall fall in down I'm not afraid I'm not afraid we don't have to be afraid of cancer we got a witness in this place Brother Andy hk's here he's a living witness that God is greater than cancer I got a I got an uncle my Uncle Mar at stage four colon cancer and according to doctor should have been dead but healing rain fell down on Mark Spencer that [Music] day I got a daddy that should have been dead 5 years ago I'm Not Afraid what Healing Rain can do so I'm not afraid of whatever you come up against no matter what's the complex is no matter what the situation is no matter how far you are going if you just let him him do the work you'll see the thing manifest that you just spoke in this atmosphere this ain't just an atmosphere of church people this is the atmosphere of the Queen of Heaven something has changed can I say it something has changed for sister Esther Smith can I say that something has changed for sister who Moore can I say something has changed for sister Anna Thomas can I say something has changed for Brother David Pierce can I say something has changed for the mlar family there's some girls down here that just a few months ago that had some K skins diseases if you take a real close look you'll can see that skin becoming like baby skin real close I'd say this to you don't be afraid to ask for the impossible I say it's what brother Rong was talking about today what Satan was trying to stop if you'll battle against that power that's trying to stop you you'll recognize the healing power that comes behind the battle that's where MDC showed up to Abraham was after the battle after the battles where mzc showed up I say it's worth battling for come on so this is more than just a little guy from South Africa this is a king of Heaven that is showing up after every one of your battles he's not just coming to Ron Spencer he's coming to Brandon Hill he he he's coming to brother Danny he's coming to brother Jason he's coming because he's that kind of a God if you battle for him for a just and righteous cause mzc will show up and you may not recognize it right now and I I just it could be in a moment when you least expect it brother Doug and things just just change we're making plans for the summer we're making those plans but all of a sudden something could come and just change those plans and no longer we planning to walk down the streets of Port Republic and walking down the streets of maybe New Market but we're walking down streets of gold locked arms together and it was worth it it was worth the battles that we went through a family battles and situations of life because MDC showed up to us [Music] I'm Not Afraid healing rain is falling down healing rain is falling [Music] down we're going to let our a viewing audience be dismissed at this time just want this time just to be our local church just now amen
