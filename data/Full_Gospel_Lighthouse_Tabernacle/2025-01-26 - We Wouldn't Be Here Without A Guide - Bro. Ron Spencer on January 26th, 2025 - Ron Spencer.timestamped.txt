[57:32] in but I think we're all on the same
[57:35] page
[57:36] right we can't see an hour from
[57:40] now we got a good idea where we're going
[57:42] to be an hour from now but we need
[57:46] him right come on in the scriptures he
[57:49] calls us to come after me come follow me
[57:54] it was constantly in the script rures
[57:57] and he was asking people to leave their
[57:59] homes he was asking to leave their
[58:02] Lifestyles many times their families but
[58:05] come follow me right now what an
[58:08] incredible decision that you have to
[58:10] make if you're going to leave you got to
[58:14] leave
[58:16] somewhere
[58:17] right I I remember many years ago when I
[58:21] when I
[58:22] was I was being dealt with to come and
[58:25] Pastor The church here
[58:26] this year is my 25th anniversary of
[58:29] being here so this year
[58:34] so boy that went
[58:37] quick that went real quick
[58:40] so but but I remember I had a very
[58:43] successful Chimney Sweep business and
[58:46] and we were doing really well with that
[58:48] and you know God knows how to interrupt
[58:50] your plans
[58:52] right and so we were doing so well and
[58:55] and uh things were going so good the
[58:58] last year that I was I was in that I
[59:02] preached 46 different meetings so you
[59:05] can imagine I would leave about Thursday
[59:07] evening go somewhere travel fly or
[59:10] whatever and preach those meetings and
[59:12] come back home and and the Lord dealt
[59:16] with me and showed me a vision that I
[59:18] would pastor this church now let me just
[59:21] tell you that was not what I was wanting
[59:23] to do
[59:28] being a pastor was not top on my
[59:34] list all pastors ought to sh say Amen
[59:37] right there Andrew you really need to
[59:39] say Amen keep him alive Lord keep him
[59:48] alive the Lord dealt with me to sell my
[59:51] business I didn't want to do that either
[59:54] because I had plans to preach here on
[59:56] the weekends and go back there and run
[59:59] my
[1:00:01] business so I came out and told sister
[1:00:03] Connie I said the Lord just spoke to me
[1:00:05] that I would sell the business do you
[1:00:07] know within an hour there was a man
[1:00:10] standing on my porch with a check in his
[1:00:14] hand no way could have a rumor nothing
[1:00:17] could go on and he said I want to buy
[1:00:20] your business and he bought my
[1:00:23] business well we had a house there and
[1:00:27] my brother said I want to buy your house
[1:00:29] and so they bought my house now the Lord
[1:00:32] knows how to get behind you he knows how
[1:00:35] to open the
[1:00:38] door he knows how to open the door get
[1:00:41] behind you and push you
[1:00:46] through I just gave you a personal
[1:00:50] experience of how I got
[1:00:53] here every one of you have got a story
[1:00:56] right now I I I want to I I know the
[1:01:00] political world is all is all array
[1:01:03] right now of of getting real rid of the
[1:01:06] illegal aliens and all of those
[1:01:08] different kind of things and I'm not
[1:01:09] going to talk politics but we're getting
[1:01:11] ready to leave come
[1:01:14] on and it's not going to take police
[1:01:16] officers to make me
[1:01:18] move I may be drinking
[1:01:21] coffee I don't drink coffee now but
[1:01:23] maybe I'm drinking maybe drinking a hot
[1:01:26] tea and and drinking a hot tea and all
[1:01:28] of a sudden I feel a real sharp CH body
[1:01:33] change I'm going to a
[1:01:39] place Hallelujah now let me just
[1:01:47] say I don't have everything figured out
[1:01:50] of how we're going to get
[1:01:52] there so I'm glad that I have a guide
[1:01:57] amen the scripture says that in
[1:02:00] Revelations it says it several times
[1:02:02] come up
[1:02:03] hither and it's an invitation because
[1:02:06] you can't reach yourself that way then
[1:02:09] Jesus
[1:02:10] prays lead me
[1:02:13] not into
[1:02:16] temptation Lead Me Not So if he can lead
[1:02:21] me not he can lead me yes amen Amen
[1:02:26] brother Brandon would preach a sermon
[1:02:28] the dove leads the
[1:02:30] lamb five years ago and I'm celebrating
[1:02:33] my fifth year anniversary thank
[1:02:36] God if you trust
[1:02:39] me I will use you like never
[1:02:42] before for five years he has led me
[1:02:45] through Cancer Treatments through a lot
[1:02:47] of difficult things and the re reason I
[1:02:50] haven't preached over the last few weeks
[1:02:52] is I've been through a a kidney stone
[1:02:56] Journey let me just say us men are not
[1:02:59] built to have
[1:03:02] babies but I gave birth to a healthy
[1:03:15] boy you've never had one you pray never
[1:03:19] to have
[1:03:22] one mine just happened to be pretty
[1:03:24] large and then there were several others
[1:03:26] that came as well in Psalms chap 68 and
[1:03:29] verse one it
[1:03:31] says let God
[1:03:35] arise and let his enemies be scattered I
[1:03:38] think this is such a powerful scripture
[1:03:41] let God arise and let his enemies be
[1:03:43] scattered let them also that hate him
[1:03:47] flee before him in Revelations Chapter 3
[1:03:52] of course we know the scriptures I Know
[1:03:54] Thy works and thou art neither cold or
[1:03:56] hot and they would that thou were cold
[1:03:58] or hot this is Revelations 3:14: 1516
[1:04:01] and so then because Thou Art lukewarm
[1:04:03] and neither cold nor hot I will spew
[1:04:06] thee out of my mouth now notice what he
[1:04:08] says here and I think this is important
[1:04:11] because thou sayest I am rich and
[1:04:14] increased with goods and have need of
[1:04:18] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[1:04:21] wretched miserable and poor and blind
[1:04:26] and
[1:04:28] naked over the last couple of weeks you
[1:04:31] have
[1:04:32] saw some of the richest people some of
[1:04:35] the most powerful people that there is
[1:04:38] they were living in a cursed
[1:04:41] place was a place that was cursed by the
[1:04:44] prophet of the
[1:04:45] Lord and it's also cursed to to sink
[1:04:48] into the
[1:04:50] sea but there's many occasions where the
[1:04:52] sin became so great until the fire
[1:04:56] consumed and I'm not saying good to
[1:04:58] anything I think it's so horrible but
[1:05:01] let me just say this to you it burn it
[1:05:04] up rich
[1:05:09] poor incredible million dollar
[1:05:14] homes and even
[1:05:17] tents this world is not built to stay
[1:05:23] here brother BR says it reminds me of a
[1:05:25] little boy going home in a dark
[1:05:28] nut and going through a graveyard
[1:05:31] whistling he just whistles as hard as he
[1:05:33] can because he's merely calling a
[1:05:36] bluff to
[1:05:38] himself he don't want to think that he's
[1:05:42] scared but he's
[1:05:45] whistling to try to relax
[1:05:48] himself but down in the bottom of it
[1:05:50] he's
[1:05:51] scared behind every Tombstone there's a
[1:05:55] go
[1:05:58] and he's so scared and he's whistling
[1:06:00] just as kind to kind of to
[1:06:03] quieten
[1:06:05] himself that's where America is
[1:06:10] at he tells of a story and I think it's
[1:06:14] incredible he said It reminds me of a
[1:06:16] story that I read some years ago about a
[1:06:18] prospector in Arizona for those that you
[1:06:21] remember I told this story at brother
[1:06:24] Homer Frasier's funeral
[1:06:27] and he was one of those goldm minded
[1:06:30] people and he wanted to get rich all at
[1:06:33] once and so he goes into the desert to
[1:06:38] Prospect and while he was prospecting
[1:06:42] The Story Goes that he found a a great
[1:06:45] nest of
[1:06:46] nuggets and just overnight became a
[1:06:49] multimillionaire with socks full of
[1:06:52] gold and he packed his burrow
[1:06:56] and he and his burrow and his faithful
[1:06:58] dog started back to civilization with a
[1:07:01] with the sweet flying from the fa from
[1:07:05] sweat flying from his face and his eyes
[1:07:08] glittering and on the road he was having
[1:07:10] a good
[1:07:12] time the rest he was going to have a
[1:07:15] good time the rest of his
[1:07:17] life so when he was nearing to the place
[1:07:20] where he was his destination would
[1:07:23] be they said that that was an old
[1:07:26] abandoned Shack and he'd went into this
[1:07:29] Shack and laid the money and up on up
[1:07:33] upon the table by itself and there was a
[1:07:36] grease candle and he was looking over
[1:07:38] the nuggets and little did he know that
[1:07:41] there was eyes that was watching
[1:07:45] him and along about the time that he
[1:07:48] laid down and he went to sleep while
[1:07:50] starting to get some sleep his Old
[1:07:53] Faithful dog be to bark
[1:07:56] and he was laying on his pillow thinking
[1:07:59] tomorrow I'll I'll change these nuggets
[1:08:01] for currency and I'll buy great cars and
[1:08:04] I'll drink good whiskey and I'll do all
[1:08:07] of these things and I'll have a big time
[1:08:09] I'll go to Every dance and and and all
[1:08:12] that he would be he was just
[1:08:15] daydreaming and his dog kept barking and
[1:08:19] barking away and he went to the door and
[1:08:21] opened the door and said shut up and the
[1:08:25] old dog whin and he was tried to he was
[1:08:27] tied to a leash and and he tried to warn
[1:08:31] his
[1:08:32] master but he went back again and he
[1:08:34] laid down upon his bed and the dog
[1:08:37] barking again and he called him and Time
[1:08:39] After Time shut
[1:08:42] up I don't want to hear
[1:08:45] you I want a lovely dream tonight of
[1:08:48] Good Times of I'm going to have tomorrow
[1:08:51] and and when I cash in my gold and
[1:08:54] finally the dog barking again he became
[1:08:57] angry and reached in the corner and got
[1:08:59] a double barrel shotgun and went to the
[1:09:01] door and both pulled both of the Hammers
[1:09:04] back and shot that
[1:09:06] dog so that'll take care of you I won't
[1:09:10] need you anymore anyhow he set the gun
[1:09:13] down and laid it on his bed and folded
[1:09:16] his hands and went went with his dream
[1:09:18] and he fell to sleep and in just a
[1:09:21] little while the door opened easily and
[1:09:24] someone slipped across the floor and
[1:09:26] plunged a knife into his bosom and took
[1:09:30] the gold and left with it oh what did he
[1:09:33] do and this is a statement we get to
[1:09:35] what did he do he killed the
[1:09:39] voice that was warning
[1:09:45] him I use that in brother
[1:09:50] Frasier's funeral because brother Homer
[1:09:52] had had baptized hundreds and hundreds
[1:09:55] of
[1:09:56] people led many to the Lord but not
[1:10:00] everybody stayed they walked
[1:10:04] away you know after a while you can hush
[1:10:07] that warning you can you can actually
[1:10:10] sear your conscience right to where you
[1:10:13] don't want to hear that voice
[1:10:17] anymore you can seear it to the place to
[1:10:19] where you know as a pastor you're a
[1:10:23] shepherd and you're watching watching
[1:10:25] over
[1:10:27] sheep brother Homer would always say
[1:10:29] sheep are
[1:10:31] dumb remember that brother Ray he' say
[1:10:34] sheep are
[1:10:36] dumb and they get in all kind of trouble
[1:10:39] and you know sheep try to they try to
[1:10:43] actually they try to doctor their
[1:10:46] themselves and Doctor one another and
[1:10:48] they'll get in
[1:10:51] trouble and you said but brother Ron I I
[1:10:53] don't need a pastor I I don't need a
[1:10:56] guide I don't need a
[1:11:02] leader brother BR says a GU he he has to
[1:11:06] know the
[1:11:08] way he has to know where he's going and
[1:11:11] what he's doing and how to take care of
[1:11:14] you along the road he's got to see that
[1:11:18] you don't come up lost I love that a God
[1:11:22] is a selected man the state the state
[1:11:26] selects this man and if he is a God now
[1:11:29] he's he's going to take you on a trip
[1:11:31] Into the Wilderness and and he said
[1:11:33] where perhaps that you're not used to
[1:11:35] going it's not a good thing for you to
[1:11:38] go without
[1:11:42] one amen I'm sorry here just for a
[1:11:48] moment I can't see this morning so I'm
[1:11:51] having
[1:11:53] trouble he said frankly sometimes you
[1:11:56] can't even go go without one for
[1:11:58] instance maybe to Canada all of us know
[1:12:02] that you have to have a guide if you've
[1:12:03] hunt in Canada he said the God has to
[1:12:06] assign your license to the game board he
[1:12:09] has to assign himself to it and he is
[1:12:11] responsible for you and if anything
[1:12:14] happens to you it's his
[1:12:17] responsibility he's got to take care of
[1:12:21] you he's got to see that you're not lost
[1:12:25] he's got to be sure that he don't send
[1:12:28] you in somewhere that you don't know
[1:12:31] your way back and if you do get lost
[1:12:34] he's got to know the country so well
[1:12:37] that he can pick you up just any time
[1:12:41] he's got to know all of these things or
[1:12:44] he cannot be a God
[1:12:46] right come on now I want you to think
[1:12:49] about this Our God knows the way
[1:12:54] amen he knows what we'll get into even
[1:12:57] tomorrow even next
[1:13:01] week There's Nothing a surprise to my
[1:13:06] God God never gets in crisis he's always
[1:13:10] watching over you you've heard me say it
[1:13:14] before you are more protected than the
[1:13:17] president of the United States of
[1:13:22] America let me just say it to you young
[1:13:24] people that are going to school you're
[1:13:26] not alone right you're not alone there's
[1:13:30] angels that actually go to school with
[1:13:32] you to protect you to watch over
[1:13:39] you listen they know the way
[1:13:46] amen
[1:13:53] now the scripture says
[1:13:55] he is the only place that can give you
[1:14:00] safety he is God's provided
[1:14:04] safety now he says oh we can provide
[1:14:09] this and provide that and and it's fall
[1:14:13] but when God provides
[1:14:15] anything it's
[1:14:18] Eternal and God's provided way is safety
[1:14:22] in Christ he said oh how I love it when
[1:14:25] you're in him when troubles come like
[1:14:30] sickness or weary dis disappointments
[1:14:34] any of youve ever had any of those
[1:14:37] amen he bore our sorrows with his
[1:14:40] stripes we are healed amen everything
[1:14:44] that we have need of for the rest of our
[1:14:48] journey come
[1:14:51] on everything we have need of for for
[1:14:55] the rest of our journey is in Jesus
[1:15:03] Christ Now 1 chonicles chapter 16 and
[1:15:08] verse1
[1:15:09] 15 be you mindful always of of his
[1:15:13] Covenant the word which he commanded to
[1:15:16] a thousand
[1:15:17] Generations even of the Covenant which
[1:15:20] he made with Abraham and the oath to
[1:15:23] unto Isaac and confirmed the same to
[1:15:26] Jacob for a law and to Israel for an
[1:15:29] Everlasting Covenant saying unto thee
[1:15:33] will I give thee land of Canaan the lot
[1:15:36] of your inheritance when you were but a
[1:15:39] few even a few and strangers in it
[1:15:43] notice I have provided for you all
[1:15:47] along not just for
[1:15:50] you but for your children and for your
[1:15:54] children's children
[1:15:56] children and when they went from Nation
[1:15:58] to nation and from one Kingdom to
[1:16:00] another people he suffered no man to do
[1:16:04] them wrong notice how he watched over
[1:16:08] his
[1:16:09] children are you with me now he suffered
[1:16:13] nobody to do you
[1:16:15] wrong thank you Lord many of our lives
[1:16:19] would be much different if God wasn't
[1:16:21] watching over and the enemies doing
[1:16:23] different kind of things to destroy you
[1:16:26] and God said I will not allow them to do
[1:16:32] it Hallelujah he reproves
[1:16:36] Kings for your
[1:16:41] sake
[1:16:43] hallelujah
[1:16:44] hallelujah Donald Trump cannot make a
[1:16:47] decision
[1:16:51] on without God watching over you that's
[1:16:54] right
[1:16:55] as much as he thinks he can do all of
[1:16:57] these things with executive orders God
[1:16:59] has already made a decision right I've
[1:17:03] got children right that I'm watching
[1:17:06] over they're not going to be here
[1:17:12] long he repr reproved Kings for their
[1:17:16] sakes now notice the statement touch not
[1:17:20] mine
[1:17:21] anointed and do my prophets no harm
[1:17:26] I find it interesting that you can
[1:17:28] attack a lot of different people out of
[1:17:30] the world and not get into any trouble
[1:17:33] but when you attack one of God's
[1:17:37] kids when you attack one of God's kids
[1:17:41] you're in trouble right and listen then
[1:17:44] it's not you against that person it's
[1:17:47] you against God that's right Amen
[1:17:50] brother brother Brandon would use the
[1:17:52] term you become God's enemy right right
[1:17:55] let me just tell you you'll lose that's
[1:18:00] right now watch this sing unto the Lord
[1:18:02] all the Earth and show forth his day to

[1:20:02] and Shout for a little while that's my
[1:20:04] God that's how great he

[1:20:48] bring somebody in and has to make a
[1:20:51] Target he'll bring a critic or
[1:20:53] unbeliever and set him down and cause
[1:20:55] him to fellowship with you under the
[1:20:57] quietness and things and then he'll
[1:20:59] shoot that guy with some kind of a
[1:21:01] poison stuff and he'll start right
[1:21:03] through the church don't take any sides
[1:21:05] with
[1:21:06] it don't take any sides with it don't
[1:21:10] you have nothing to do with it he said
[1:21:13] with anything else you stay right loving

[1:21:19] one another pray for that man that he'll
[1:21:22] be saved to or that woman woman that
[1:21:25] they'll be saved or whoever it is just
[1:21:27] pray for them and stick one with
[1:21:30] another and stay with your pastor he's
[1:21:34] the shepherd and he'll give and you give
[1:21:37] him respect he'll lead you through and
[1:21:40] that's CA he's ordained of God to do
[1:21:44] so now you guys that have been here
[1:21:47] forever in a day since the church
[1:21:49] started you know brother Homer used to
[1:21:51] hand out a word to the
[1:21:53] church he would have brother Bill Hinkle
[1:21:55] about once a year you boys don't know
[1:21:57] this but brother Bill Hinkle about once
[1:21:59] a year you remember Sister Linda he
[1:22:02] would get up and he would read this this
[1:22:04] this portion of of the word to the
[1:22:07] church because let me just say this you
[1:22:10] God is leading
[1:22:12] us and while he's leading us an enemy
[1:22:15] will try to get into
[1:22:18] you whether it's your personal family or
[1:22:21] a body of Believers he'll try to get
[1:22:23] into you it's not just you he tries to
[1:22:25] get the pastor he tries to get one
[1:22:27] another
[1:22:31] right
[1:22:32] listen we live in a world there where
[1:22:35] there's two different kinds of
[1:22:36] spirits one is the spirit of God and one
[1:22:40] is the devil
[1:22:41] spirit and if you remember it's which
[1:22:44] dog that you feed the
[1:22:46] most it don't take long for you to feed
[1:22:49] the wrong dog that's right come on I
[1:22:52] think I'm getting on the right page with
[1:22:53] you don't take long for you to get in
[1:22:56] the wrong
[1:22:57] dog and before long you'll get the wrong
[1:23:00] Spirit that's right
[1:23:03] go and it was an enemy that did that to
[1:23:06] you it wasn't God that did that to
[1:23:11] you you remember brother Wayne he
[1:23:14] brother Wayne just has a way of saying
[1:23:16] things he said somebody told me about
[1:23:19] this
[1:23:20] guy and he said told me a bad story
[1:23:23] about this guy
[1:23:24] and and he said this he said I he said
[1:23:28] that guy told me the story and I believe
[1:23:30] the guy and he
[1:23:32] said he said I I hated that
[1:23:35] guy I wouldn't talk to that guy I didn't
[1:23:39] want nothing to do with that guy he said
[1:23:41] years later he said I found out it
[1:23:43] wasn't that
[1:23:45] [Laughter]
[1:23:52] guy don't sit there like your a bunch of
[1:23:58] angels you'll hear a
[1:24:06] story not going
[1:24:11] there but I do want to go
[1:24:14] here I read you a scripture just a
[1:24:16] moment
[1:24:19] ago that told us
[1:24:21] to for ask forgiveness amen
[1:24:24] and then told us that if we forgive not
[1:24:28] our
[1:24:29] brothers then God won't forgive
[1:24:33] us now let I'm going to preach on
[1:24:35] forgiveness in a couple weeks but but I
[1:24:37] I think it's a good time to drop it
[1:24:39] right here God's telling us in his
[1:24:42] prayer of leadership being our
[1:24:46] God you've got to
[1:24:50] forgive you got to
[1:24:52] forgive and and let me say this to you
[1:24:55] when you
[1:24:56] forgive it sets you
[1:25:01] free it sets you free right and let me
[1:25:04] just say even to even the new ones here
[1:25:07] let me let me just say this to you I
[1:25:08] don't want to know your
[1:25:12] history I don't need a two-hour
[1:25:14] conversation with you to figure out
[1:25:16] you've been a bad
[1:25:18] boy I I don't need that I don't want to
[1:25:21] know nothing about that I want to know
[1:25:24] about your
[1:25:26] future that's what I want to know about
[1:25:28] your
[1:25:32] future we'll say well brother Ron I've
[1:25:34] held this against that person I've held
[1:25:36] this against that person let let me just
[1:25:39] say this to
[1:25:40] you when when Isaac will you stand just
[1:25:44] a moment yeah what are you doing on the
[1:25:47] front row did you not have a
[1:25:52] seat so Isa
[1:25:56] Isaac has stole a
[1:26:00] car and he stole a
[1:26:04] Camaro from a
[1:26:06] brother and he took it on a spin
[1:26:12] trip you know he comes back and you
[1:26:16] know Isaac gets right with
[1:26:20] God he gets right with God how long does
[1:26:23] it take to get right with
[1:26:25] God 30
[1:26:30] seconds it'll take you much
[1:26:33] longer to ask forgiveness for your
[1:26:36] spirit so Isaac drops his head and he
[1:26:39] sincerely says God I've done
[1:26:42] wrong I shouldn't have stole brother
[1:26:45] Chris's
[1:26:49] car and he goes to brother Chris he said
[1:26:52] I'm sorry brother Chris and brother
[1:26:54] Chris says did you get it up to
[1:26:57] 90 thank
[1:27:00] you and then you're sitting all way
[1:27:02] across the church and say do you know
[1:27:04] Isaac stole somebody's car when you
[1:27:05] don't think about it God's already took
[1:27:08] care of that come
[1:27:12] on aren't aren't you thankful for that
[1:27:19] [Applause]
[1:27:29] I want to ask you
[1:27:30] today how big is your god that's right
[1:27:34] how big is
[1:27:36] he you see God don't have any limits to
[1:27:39] him that's when he asked job he said
[1:27:43] job where was you at when I laid the
[1:27:47] foundations of the
[1:27:50] earth God doesn't talk to him about his
[1:27:53] circumstances or his
[1:27:56] situations he didn't have a pity party
[1:27:58] with him about what he was going
[1:28:01] through he said job where was you at
[1:28:06] when I laid the foundations of the
[1:28:13] earth I want you to just notice job had
[1:28:16] a lot of enemies and a lot of
[1:28:17] laughers but there came a time to where

[1:36:08] further the scripture says and it's very
[1:36:11] familiar to us the Lord is my shepherd
[1:36:15] and I shall not want it he maketh me to
[1:36:16] lie down in Green Pastures and he leadth
[1:36:18] me beside of the Still Waters he
[1:36:21] restoreth my soul and he leadth me at
[1:36:23] the pass of righteous for his name's
[1:36:25] sake and yay though I walk through the
[1:36:27] valley of the shadow of death I will

[1:36:38] a table before me in the presence of my
[1:36:40] enemies and thou anointest my head with
[1:36:42] all and my cup runneth over surely
[1:36:44] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[1:36:46] the days of my life and I will dwell in
[1:36:49] the house of the Lord
[1:36:51] forever chapter 2 7 and verse 5 for in

[1:41:40] of
[1:41:44] it I'm telling you those stories not
[1:41:47] just just to be telling you a
[1:41:49] story listen listen God knows the way
[1:41:55] am God knows the
[1:41:58] way I've been with different
[1:42:02] guides different guides was whether it
[1:42:04] was hunting or
[1:42:07] fishing God knows the way we were
[1:42:10] fishing one time and and you know we
[1:42:13] were we had already been there about six
[1:42:15] hours and and you know none of us had
[1:42:18] got a bite we were all paying really
[1:42:20] good money to be involved in that and
[1:42:23] you know I I just looked at the guide
[1:42:25] and I
[1:42:26] said is there no fish in this Lake and
[1:42:29] he said listen Jesus is the only
[1:42:34] God that he's a sure thing that you're
[1:42:37] going to get a
[1:42:41] fish it must have been this the bright
[1:42:44] thing for him to say we limited out in
[1:42:48] five minutes
[1:42:56] and it was
[1:43:02] over I want you to go take the hook
[1:43:05] that's in your
[1:43:08] pocket and they're wanting to pay taxes
[1:43:11] it's tax
[1:43:13] season prime time for me to tell this
[1:43:15] isn't
[1:43:16] it and I want you to take that
[1:43:18] hook and I want you to catch a fish and
[1:43:22] when you catch the fish
[1:43:24] open its
[1:43:25] mouth and it's going to have enough
[1:43:27] money to pay the
[1:43:31] taxes now listen if you'd have been
[1:43:33] standing close you'd have doubted
[1:43:36] that right listen we're human beings
[1:43:39] you're human beings well brother Ron I I
[1:43:43] I wouldn't have okay then you go
[1:43:46] fishing with brother
[1:43:49] Vernon and the Lord tells you that when
[1:43:52] you catch a fish
[1:43:53] open its mouth and it's going to have
[1:43:55] a$1 thousand check in it there'll be a
[1:43:58] lot of people in your boat brother
[1:44:02] Veron listen we're human beings so we
[1:44:06] doubt the
[1:44:17] process brother brandham tells of a
[1:44:19] story of a man named Jack Koy you ever
[1:44:23] heard this
[1:44:24] story Jack
[1:44:26] Coy he was in the wilderness and he had
[1:44:29] lost his
[1:44:31] way his horse was dying and there was no
[1:44:35] water and they were following pass that
[1:44:38] was made by
[1:44:40] Buffalo and they came to a
[1:44:43] split now there was a path that was Less
[1:44:47] Traveled and the horse refused to go on
[1:44:51] the path that was better
[1:44:55] traveled now after a little
[1:44:59] bit Jack actually decided I'm going to
[1:45:03] follow this horse cuz he's got senses
[1:45:06] that I don't
[1:45:08] have and within
[1:45:10] minutes they were in the middle of a
[1:45:13] pond with with water bathing over top of
[1:45:18] them and they were just enjoying the
[1:45:20] water over and over amen
[1:45:23] now there was some Prospectors that was
[1:45:26] there and
[1:45:28] so Jack got out of the
[1:45:31] water and they begin to tell him they're
[1:45:34] going to try to force him to take a
[1:45:36] drink of
[1:45:37] whiskey and he told them a story of his
[1:45:40] father had died a drunk and he made a
[1:45:44] promise to his mother that he would
[1:45:46] never
[1:45:49] drink and they held that jug out
[1:45:53] and they told him that if he didn't
[1:45:56] drink they were going to kill
[1:45:59] him well just about that time shots rang
[1:46:04] out there was somebody else that was
[1:46:07] watching
[1:46:09] over shots rang out and busted that
[1:46:12] whiskey jug
[1:46:14] apart and there was a guy listening to
[1:46:17] him tell the
[1:46:19] story about making a promise to his
[1:46:22] mother
[1:46:23] that he would never
[1:46:25] drink and he shot that whiskey jug right
[1:46:28] out of those those men's hands and he
[1:46:31] said sir the story that you told about
[1:46:34] your mother my mother told me to make
[1:46:36] the same promise but I didn't make the I
[1:46:40] failed on my promise but from this day
[1:46:45] forward you're going to be my
[1:46:48] God and we're going to lead many to
[1:46:51] Jesus Christ on
[1:46:56] [Applause]
[1:47:08] I hear about Peter cartright and you've
[1:47:10] heard about Peter cart where's brother
[1:47:12] Denny
[1:47:13] at I waved to brother Denny and told him
[1:47:15] I'd tell the story but this a good spot
[1:47:17] to tell
[1:47:20] it how many know Peter cartright by name
[1:47:24] Peter cartright was under the influence
[1:47:26] of John
[1:47:29] Wesley he was a circuit writer
[1:47:32] preacher but he was such a powerful
[1:47:36] speaker he would speak about 30 minutes
[1:47:39] and shake the
[1:47:42] audience now he was against slavery and
[1:47:45] he was against
[1:47:46] alcohol against the other things that he
[1:47:49] felt like that the the politicians
[1:47:52] wasn't doing good enough he thought I'm
[1:47:54] going to help
[1:47:57] him so he began to run for
[1:48:00] office and in that day you know they
[1:48:03] didn't have the luxuries of the the
[1:48:06] Telegraph and things that we have
[1:48:08] today so they had to go from town to
[1:48:11] town and they'd give their
[1:48:15] speeches and they give their speeches
[1:48:17] they stand in front of hundreds of
[1:48:19] people and give their speeches and tried
[1:48:21] to get their votes
[1:48:23] so he shows up in this
[1:48:26] town and his opponent is giv his
[1:48:31] speech I'm going somewhere with this one
[1:48:34] and his opponent is saying if I could
[1:48:36] ever meet Peter car I'd whip him I'd
[1:48:39] frail him I'd knock him I'd tear him all
[1:48:41] to
[1:48:43] pieces and Peter CL was listening to
[1:48:46] this about 30
[1:48:48] minutes and so when it seemed like it
[1:48:51] was about a wind down he said
[1:48:53] sir do you know Peter C right he said no
[1:48:57] I've never seen him before he said well
[1:48:59] I'm Peter
[1:49:01] carright
[1:49:04] amen remember brother Brandon talks
[1:49:06] about him in the greatest battle ever
[1:49:08] fought that was an appropriate preacher
[1:49:11] to pick
[1:49:12] out and he said I'll tell you what you
[1:49:16] come down here and do to me what you
[1:49:19] said to to all of these people come down
[1:49:22] here and do do that to me cuz Peter
[1:49:25] cartright was quite a preacher I think I
[1:49:27] could compare him to maybe Homer
[1:49:31] Frasier and
[1:49:33] so he said if you don't do it you're a
[1:49:36] liar and you don't deserve public
[1:49:40] office so that man felt a little courage
[1:49:42] and he jumped down off of the stage and
[1:49:45] he ran up to Peter cartright and wanted
[1:49:47] to thrash him
[1:49:50] wanted and Peter car whipped him right
[1:49:54] there and then pulled him down to the
[1:49:58] river and he explained to the hundreds
[1:50:00] of people up on the up on the bank says
[1:50:04] this man's not converted so I'm going to
[1:50:06] baptize the devil that's inside of him
[1:50:12] [Applause]
[1:50:25] can you imagine where we would be
[1:50:27] without a messenger
[1:50:31] right can you imagine where we would be
[1:50:34] I'm coming to a close without the seals
[1:50:37] being opened that's
[1:50:39] right without knowing who the horse
[1:50:41] riders were and knowing the enemy that
[1:50:44] we're fighting right now can you imagine
[1:50:47] where we would be without one sermon
[1:50:49] called false anointed ones of the end
[1:50:52] time that's right I think about that
[1:50:55] sermon with all these preachers with all
[1:50:57] of these gifts but no truth right I
[1:51:01] think about all of those things as as
[1:51:03] our guide laid it out for
[1:51:06] us America didn't want to
[1:51:10] God right and that's why she's in the
[1:51:13] condition that she's in right that's
[1:51:16] right let me let me just explain
[1:51:17] something to you had America accepted
[1:51:20] this message
[1:51:24] we wouldn't need a police force right we
[1:51:28] wouldn't need a
[1:51:30] hospital we wouldn't need a psychiatric
[1:51:33] lab
[1:51:36] anywhere because that's the kind of land
[1:51:38] that we're getting ready to go
[1:51:42] to this message has come not just to
[1:51:46] raise up men but to raise up a bride of
[1:51:49] Jesus Christ to live in that City
[1:51:54] yes no
[1:51:58] hospitals we'll never start a service

[1:53:18] my their car right up to where we were
[1:53:21] at
[1:53:23] and then I'd get out and hunt the
[1:53:26] day well we would fellowship with our
[1:53:28] guide
[1:53:31] and you know after a day or so he said
[1:53:35] if you if you don't mind I I want to sit
[1:53:37] in a stand with you all
[1:53:40] day I was sit with you all day well I

[1:53:53] did a lot of things in hunting he knew
[1:53:55] more about deer than than I ever thought
[1:53:57] about it he done forgot about
[1:54:00] it but we got in that stand and we begin

[1:54:10] had been a teacher in
[1:54:12] denominations a teacher for years and
[1:54:15] decades and he was an
[1:54:18] astrophysicist and had that degree
[1:54:23] super smart
[1:54:25] man and after a couple of days of
[1:54:28] hunting with us in that stand
[1:54:32] I we talked about from Abraham to
[1:54:35] Nehemiah all the way
[1:54:39] through when I
[1:54:41] finished he told me he said he made a
[1:54:43] statement to you he said I don't know
[1:54:45] who was guiding

[1:54:54] me just say this to you and I want to
[1:54:55] end this with this you're guiding people
