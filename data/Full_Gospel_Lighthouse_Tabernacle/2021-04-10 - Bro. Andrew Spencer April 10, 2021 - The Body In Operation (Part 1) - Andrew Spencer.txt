hallelujah amen amen well it's happy to be back home and in the pulpit here at home again and we certainly certainly enjoyed last weekend's services that you had here with brother mark and brother matthew and so thankful for them for stepping in and just falling right into the position that god called them to be and certainly thankful and i know you enjoyed it i know you enjoyed brother mark just the inspiration of life there he's just he's born in the fire and we certainly enjoyed ourselves and and louisiana there at the eastern meetings of brother tim pruitt's and we bring greetings back from all of them there and seeing such a mighty move of god there and i'm sure 90 of you maybe 100 percent of you have been able to take in those services or were a part of those services at that time and i know that if you've watched them they were a real blessing to you and i just say that it was a real honor to be there and be in those meetings to be a brother danny brother tim and just see to see the things that we've seen and then to see our pastor speak with such passion and the anointing of the lord just moving him i i know that there were some people that were watching me because i was watching him and uh i'd be honest i had not seen my dad or my or our pastor move in such a way and preach under that such such passion like that and over in quite some time and and uh it was i was just blown away by it all still blown away and i believe i'm carrying effects of that even even tonight and i believe there'll be effects of that meeting throughout eternity that will tell of and i just have to say that we're we're packing we're packing a revival it's not nuts that nothing that we carried back home in our in our briefcase but it's something that we're packing in our heart and we're just so stirred and so thankful for the the the holy ghost how he's doing things in our life and and i'm just asking that we'd have that same type of meeting right here why shouldn't we have those type of meetings you know to be honest i feel like we're we're just blessed beyond measure we have these type of meetings every weekend and just to just to see and to get under the inspiration of the of the meeting and just to see what god's doing for his people and we're a blessed people we're a blessed people and i believe that the angel is here he's here to carry us not just through laodicea but to carry us all the way into the rapture amen amen let's let's just go to the word this evening if you have your bibles we'd like uh like to look over in the book of first corinthians chapter 12. first corinthians chapter 12 and verse 12 amen amen our hearts are stirred saints and we're just just looking for the coming of the lord amen amen first corinthians chapter 12 and verse 12 the bible says here for as the body is one and half many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and having been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the ear shall say because i am not the eye i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body but now are they many members yet but one body amen let's speak to the author of the word this evening father we come before you humbly lord just desiring father for such a move of the spirit of god in our lives lord in this church service in this meeting that we've come lord we've not come here idly we've not come here lord in vain we've come here to speak to you and to hear from you and asking god that we would just see a mighty move of the spirit of the living god here in our congregation one more time lord we humble ourselves before you asking god that you would just take us into the realm father of the believer may we just lay aside every weight in sin that does so easily beset us lord lord may we just get in one mind get in one accord lord get into a place where the spirit of the living god can speak to us oh god we're asking lord that you would heal those that are that are afflicted that you would deliver those that are bound father lord i pray that you'd set the captive free father may you bring a an edification to the body tonight lord move us where you need us to be father for your glory sake now father we ask that you take control of the service for your glory in the name of jesus christ and the body of christ says amen may god bless you you may be seated in the presence of the lord we would like to speak to you this evening and we don't know exactly how this this service will go or if it'll transition over into another another service but we'd like to speak to you this evening on the body the body in operation the body and operation and we know that that god and we're very acquainted that god is god is working through the body and working through gifts of the spirit where god is coming down afresh and pouring out his spirit into the body and when we know that when christ was here that he told us that he would send us a comforter that he would send to god that would he would be that god that would guide us into all truth and that he would be there with us no matter where we would go he told us that that i'll not leave you and i'll not forsake you but he would be the god that would guide us into all things that would guide us into all truth and i'm so thankful to know that the god tonight is is the same lord jesus he's still here and he's still directing his people and moving them into the place of maturity into the place of truth into the doctrinal into the doctrine of the gospel of jesus christ and the god that you and i have here tonight was paul's god he was the same god as he was with peter and when you see peter on the peter on the scene you begin to see paul come on the scene but there was no conflict in their gospel but the same god that was guiding peter was the same god that was guiding paul that was speaking through them and yet they not had not a convention where they would come down and speak over things but the god was leading them into the same doctrinal truths that would bring them and bring edification to the body and that same god was william branham's god and you could see that the same anointing that was on paul you could see that same holy spirit that was guiding the messenger of this age when others when others tried to pull him and they tried to persecute him or tried to persuade him in different ways he would only stay where the god said stay they tried to pull him off of his doctrines and tried to pull him off of this and and give us gifts give us these things and if you just let down on on women preachers if you just let down on water baptism if you just let down on these certain doctrinal truths then you can come into our fold and you'll be used in our fold like never before but i'm so thankful that we're standing under a messenger that did not bend and was not persuaded by men of theology and men that were of great stature of their ideologies of what the bible had said but there was a god that was guiding our messenger that would not allow him to to waver in one way nor even go off the scene in his own humanity but he would guide him he would guide him and and i i love this quote that brother branham said now he said now he runs his own business now we we understand that that that we are equated with a supernatural ministry like never before like the world has never seen and i believe tonight that we could say that we are blessed beyond measure to be a part of this supernatural message be a part of these things that that didn't die in 1965 but are still in the body still moving in the body they're still gifts there's still power in the body they're still anointing of the mighty angel that's in the body but we're acquainted that that that guard used a messenger by the name of william branham and we'd watch how that god would use him and brother branham said that he runs his own business he said now i don't tell him he tells me i don't operate him he operates me but it's a gift that you just yield yourself to he said look at this microphone you're hearing my voice but that microphone is a dumb mute until something operates it is that right it can't speak itself the music we hear it's a mute unless something unless something makes it unless something is making it it's a mute so we know that that that we are standing here and if we are the mighty of jesus christ that we can only move as the headship of christ operates the body but only the elect of god the predetermined before the foundation of the world are walking and in a capacity to be able to move under the operation of the full authority of jesus christ notice what the bible said in revelations that the spirit and the bride are saying the same thing they're saying come they're not wavering on one another if you're standing up and you're not saying what the spirit says you're not preaching what paul but preached bible said that they say the same thing that even jesus himself said he said for it's not ye that speak but it's the father or the spirit of the father that speaks within you so it's not the humanity but it's the divinity of god that it's expressing himself through humanity you go to thinking about humanity and you go to thinking about the messenger of the day how could a seventh grade educated kentucky hillbilly come out of those hills packing a message like he had and had such spiritual understanding able to break into a realm and being being able to ponder their minds of theologies ponder the minds of of great intellectual speakers of the day to ponder their minds and think where did this heal billy get this understanding he's not went to no school he's not went to no theologies where did he get it from but you know that brother branham would say it was the angel that told me that it was the angel that told me that when you see him moving in that power you know when william branham come out of that cave back in that commission it was more than a man there was an angel that was moving you remember when brother branham you're acquainted when brother branham comes to preach the seals he said i took some history and i was going to bring some things that i preached before and some things that i had that i had looked over he said i was going to come to the pulpit with that he said but about 12 o'clock in the day he came into the room you see you see he was going to come with what he thought those seals were but god the angel so cared about you that he will not allow humanity to stand in front of divinity are you with me if he'd just come with what he thought of the books would still be sealed but we stand here in full authority as the body of jesus christ with an open book an unsealed book hallelujah i wasn't the one that appeared down there on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are i'm only the one i'm only one that's near when he does it i was only a voice and he used to say it wasn't what i knew it's what i surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he is the one that you're feeding on can he say amen can you say amen he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man let's get a greek big hearty amen right there you're you're not feeding on a man his words will fail but you're feeding but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man that's where you're drawing your strength that's where you're drawing your power that's where you're drawing your anointing you're not feeding on my ministry you're not feeding on brother ron's ministry you're not feeding on the man william branham's ministry you're feeding on the unfailing body word it won't fail you but it'll produce you to be exactly what god ordained you to be see the spirit working in the flesh of the church just like it worked in the flesh of jesus because it's a part of the body notice over in colossians chapter 1 verse 15. the bible says who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones dominions principalities powers all things were created by him and for him he is before all things seek ye first the kingdom of god he is before all things he was before time began he will be here when time ends he is before all things and if he can be before all things in your life all things will consist in your life all things will be held together if he is the head of your marriage the head of your house the head of your family the head of your heart you ain't got to worry if you're going to shake and crumble apart you're going to hold together because there's a power there's a power there that's bringing the body together it'll be so fiddly joined together it's tempered with grace it's tempered and put together by the holy ghost you think about how god is brought brother william here and brother nathanael here and these elements have helped in these elements of these elements of bueno vista these elements of madison what's god doing he's building a body he's building a body and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence now paul would say over in philippians chapter 2 and verse 5 he would say let this mind being you which was also in christ jesus and if you go to looking at the old at your own human body and humanity you know that it be that the body gets its intellects from the brain it all functions that are done throughout the body there are they they are functioning by that headship i have seen some people that i'm pretty sure they're brainless but you watch their that the headship or the body is functioning by that brain by that that brain is telling you to breathe that brain is telling you to swallow that brain is is working digestion in your body it's working eye movement in the body it's working the heartbeat and etc down through the body so we know that if the body will move it has to be the headship or the intellect telling the body to move [Applause] so if the body starts speaking that you can overcome by the power of the word it's something telling you there's a headship that's saying you're more than a conqueror if the body starts preaching healing that there is healing for you that by his stripes you are healed it is telling you there's a headship that's saying there's healing for you if the body or the ministry starts preaching there's deliverance chains can be broke circumstances can be overcome you are seeing a body in operation by the headship of almighty god this body is being moved by none other than him notice the body's growing it's growing from the freak from the feet coming up it's coming up more as it comes up there's more important parts of the body from the feet on into the lungs on into the heart on into the head and who is the head who is the head that's the intelligence i'm reading your prophet how's the body move by the head amen and the government shall be upon his the body will move by the headship and the government shall be upon his shoulders what is his shoulders his body amen that's where the real true church speaks in his power that's where the apostolic power returns to the church when the government shall be upon his shoulders he said there's coming a real church you can see the prophet as he's looking out into that land there's coming a church there's coming a church she's coming and she the government shall rest upon the shoulders [Applause] he was looking into a realm and he was seeing a people that believed his message that one was one with this message she's here hallelujah it ain't your own knowledge it's so it isn't your own knowledge of what you've attained throughout the years your knowledge can be stripped from you your intellects can be taken from you but revelation cannot be stolen if all you've got is knowledge from somebody else somebody else can take it away if all you've got is intellect from some book somewhere it can be taken away but if god has so revealed himself that he's in the body he's moving in a body that can't be taken away it's over i like that no more wavering no more trying to figure which way is up or which way's there it's settled you know when you're just when you're first getting married you're trying to work out all the kinks am i is this pinch me is this real can i really be this far in love and all of a sudden you get so upset because she put the toothpaste where you didn't want her to you see you're working out the kinks you're kind of you're kind of settling in and you're now i'm gonna talk so i'm gonna talk something to you young people you understand after you get through it that major leap you get through them first six months you finally made it and then you go through the next six months but you're what you're doing is you're operating in a spot of marriage that you hadn't operated there before and you watch as a teamwork of the body is getting built between a unity that has come together and you watch when those two that have become one you can see when a marriage when it's really working you can see that they can finish each other's sentences they can say they can almost say what they're going to say without even saying it because they're so fitly joined together they've worked all the kinks out they've got settled in and they know what they're going to do jesus knows what you're going to do before you ever do it he doesn't have to wake you up and say hey honey today's your day today's your day go out there and do such and such he knows what you're going to do he knows how you're going to act he knows how you're going to operate you're not going to move without him the power of the marriage rest in the unity hallelujah in the rising of the sun he said is he living in you if he does he'll identify himself there if he's there he's bound to let himself be known you can't hide him he stands out can you imagine trying to hide jesus over in the corner somewhere it just ain't gonna work out you can see some people they're embarrassed about jesus being in the room but you can't hide jesus if jesus is on the inside of your heart it's going to come out you can't hide jesus jesus is going to live jesus is going to speak jesus is going to act he said but i'm so glad that there is a ten thousand octane power of the word of god and a holy ghost to light it up and to resurrect the power of god into a man's life for a woman's life or into a church that shoved that cadillac down that road yonder under thy dynamic power of the holy ghost which came and came back and was waved over the people at the day of pentecost making him the same yesterday today and forever there was the first chief come up from all the prophets which was the son of god the king of all the prophets he said there has been churches churches brides brides churches brides brides but there's got to come one hallelujah there has got to come a real by bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it that makes the church live that makes the church move in the power of his resurrection mary you are highly favored you're standing in an hour of the restored and revealed word there ain't been no other part of the body that's had the headship set upon it but you we look at wesley he had a portion of it you look at luther he had a portion of it and you look at the restoration of the gifts they had a portion of it but now the headship now the headship is operating through the body let me say when you're preaching over my head no i'm not i'm preaching to what is yours the only reason that you may feel like i'm preaching over your head it's because you've not dug down into what this message really is and if you would dig down you'd find that this is more than knowledge this is a revelation i'm sick and tired of hearing that you're preaching over my head that's that's too far up there that's that's beyond my death i'm sick and tired of hearing those things well that's where that's for that's just for the ministry that's just for people that's been there for 20 years it's for you young people [Applause] it's for your newborn babies in christ the power of the living god is wanting to operate in a body [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah brother brandon said the anointing will strike the whole church of the living god and she'll rise to her feet she'll rise to her feet like a mighty march in the army the sick will be healed by a word the blind will see that death will hear the dead will be raised up and the power of god will shake the whole world with the church of the living god this ain't days gone by this is where you're living at what am i trying to get you to that you are the body that god has wanted to operate with god's looking for a body that he can defeat cancer in i'd say he's got one god is looking for a body that he can overcome sin with i believe that he's got one god's looking for a body that'll overcome temptation i'd say he's got one he's looking for a body that the anointing could strike and you pray a prayer of faith over somebody all of a sudden they come running in we've seen it we've seen it in our own ranks when somebody come forth our little sister came forth and said i'm asking for my for my own brother to come come in come bring the prodigals back here i'm praying for him and god woke him up out of his sleep woke him up out of his sleep and brought him right to the altar what power is operating that you say i don't see it i don't feel it god never asked if you feel it god never asked if you see it god asked you do you believe it full gospel lighthouse do you believe that bride of jesus christ rise to your feet this is who you are this is who you ordained to be hallelujah the move is on for the body hallelujah hallelujah the bible says in colossians chapter 2 and 9 for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and you are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power i want you to say that that you are complete in him and whom also you are circumcised with a circumcision made without hands and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ buried with him in baptism wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation who hath raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh has he quickened hath he made alive together with him having forgiven you all trespasses forgiven you of all your trespasses plotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us that was a whole stack of them that was against us all of the ordinances he blotted him out which was contrary took us to us and he took it away out of the way and nailing it to his cross you were quickened you were changed you were saved by the faith in christ jesus which faith was produced by the operation or the energy of almighty god it's faith in the son of god that moves you to believe that this is that which was prophesied by the prophet joel that in the last days i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh it's faith that allows you to operate it's faith that makes you move to believe that all things are possible to them that belief it's faith it's faith hallelujah hallelujah you can go you can go and look over let's just change our change our our thought just for a moment or change our attention you can go and look over in the book of judges chapter 13. and you could see where the story of samson begins to grow how that israel had did evil in the sight of the lord by living in the land of the danites and living there and the philistines had come in and god because they had did evil in the sight of the lord and there was a woman whose husband her name was manoah who who was who was childless and had not bore a child but there came an angel from the lord and spoke to manoah's wife and said that you will bear a child and that he will deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines and you can read the story over in judges chapter 13 how that manoa how that he he questioned and he sought the lord and he laid an altar before the lord and he stood out there and he was waiting for the inspiration of the angel to come and the angel said oh that the woman has said unto you it will be and you can go on and read and you can see the power that samson had you could see how he grew and that god would move on him and he would do the work that he was built to do because they told him that he would be a nazarite nazarite all of his life but he could not shave his head and he could not eat of the vine and he could not take of the strong drink that's what the angel said so as the child is growing forth you can watch as they begin to testify of what the angel had spoke to them personally and you can watch as samson grows into the man that he is built to be to be a deliverer of israel he's got samson he's got strength like nobody else has got the anointing of the lord can strike him and he can break he can break the head of a thousand philistines he can catch he can catch in life light fires with foxes there is a supernatural element in samson's life because he was the body that god was operating in to deliver israel out of the hands of the philistines all right all right now notice he said brother random said in in in the i deceived church by the world he said he said now now samson was a great deal like the church he said it started off right started off in the right direction he started off and and was called a mighty man of valor he started out serving the lord and keeping his words and doing his commandments and that was somewhat like the church it started off on as we would say in the world expression it started off on the right foot it started to keep the commandments of the lord and as long as samson followed the lord the lord used samson for god can keep anyone and use anyone that will follow after him for it's god's business but when he when we turn to a side away from the things of god then god cannot use us any longer when we will walk steadfastly after the commandments of god when we will stay in the pages of the bible and worship by the written word and worship him in spirit and in truth of the word then god can use any individual but when we take but when they take a notion to turn aside after something else then god cannot use that person any longer so samson makes a very outstanding representation of the church of today when the church started out god could use the church for the church walked diligently after the commandments of the lord and kept all of his judgments and his statutes and done all of his commandments and god was with the church but it seems to be that there is such a weakening place amongst the church by jesus so sampson when he started out as long as he was following the words of the angel and doing the words of the angel he prospered and he was successful where the angel had spoke but when he started turning from what the angel had spoken what the angel had testified and he started turning himself and giving himself over to the lust of the flesh then sampson began to give his heart over to the things of the world samson was not built for the things of the world samson was not built for for the things that delilah would put him in and you were not born for the purpose of living in filth you were not born to build you were not born or built to flirt with the world when i speak the world i'm saying everything involved when you were not built to flirt with the world nor dabble in the religions of the world or easy believism i've just confessed that you got the holy ghost and then you believe that you're born again and you walk away and you'll live a christian life you were not built so that you could come and just lay your hands on the altar and put your name on a book you were not built to be that kind of people that might work for the chicken the chicken pen or the chicken yard down the road they might be able to overcome their devils down there of easy believism of i'll just confess i'll be baptizing trinitarian doctrine and i'll be able to overcome that might work for a chicken but you ain't no chicken too many times it's trying to creep its way in this message i believe brother branham's a prophet i believe i play a tape i do this i do that my mom and daddy go to a message church i'm in it if you're not in christ you're not in it this message ain't just another formality this message ain't just another religion this message is deity himself embodying himself in a body we're not on a picnic where we can just get by with just confessing like joel osteen and just smile at the devil he might be over to come his devils by just smiling at him but you are coming face to face with real devils real demonic powers and if you're going to face those demonic powers you're going to have to have something to overcome them with you better be backing the message of the hour [Applause] joel osteen t.d jakes these great men of televangelists they cannot overcome laodicea they can have great works they can work in the realm of the second poll but they cannot live in the realm of the third pool [Applause] they can't work where you're working at they can't live where you're living at they can't do what you do because you're not feeding on what they're feeding on you're feeding on the unfailing body word i might go past my 45 minutes tonight so buckle up too many times people get the idea that just because they go to church that they're saved just because they raise their hand in some form of religion and sing some some song a few songs that they're okay you watch people you watch people and wow the worship is going forth and while the singing of songs is going for man alive you the thought that's the greatest christian in the world man they know how to really bring god down on the scene but watch them when the word comes they'll sit there in their old dead sanctimonious state and sit there and look at you like you don't know that they don't know what they're looking at ain't got nothing to do with me but let the singing cut loose man you'd have thought that she had a holy dress longer than anybody else in the building and he had the holy ghost like nobody before but when the word starts going forth watch the reaction if this word don't excite you i'd say you need to change your birth if you're okay with just worship and going home watch out the philistines are upon you [Applause] too many times people are okay with cain worship they're okay with the beauty of it they're okay with lifting their hands they're okay with singing a few songs of beauty and exhorting with their lips they're okay with but they need to move you need to move if you're satisfied in cain worship get up and move if somebody on your pew is not allowing you to worship and keeps you in pain worship get up and move where the fire's at get up here where abel is worshiping at where he dies on the altar where the lamb died i'm don't sit there i'm not preaching to you i'm just preaching but don't sit in that condition where you have to sit there and worry what that person's with through get up and come get up and come ain't nobody got no saved you here ain't nobody got set in set an organization get up and move to where the fire's at [Applause] the body was built to move and freely operate under the headship and the power of the head but many times the body's been bound it's been bound and can operate in the realm that it was built to operate in you can look over in revelations chapter 9 and you could see where 200 000 000 demons had been bound for all those years in the river of euphrates you can see those those spiritual devils that come out but you'll notice that when the seals were released that those devils were released or turned loose out of the river of euphrates and you can watch in revelations chapter nine you can watch as that smoke comes out of that bottomless pit that bottomless pit you can see as it rises up and if you've ever been in a smoke fire or if you've been in a place where the fire's at and the smoke begins to choke you out it becomes to get so blinding that you can't see where you're going and you can see that this layout i see in church age is so blinded by the smoke that's coming out of the bottomless pit politics are blinded like never before politics are blinded if you can't see that that washington is so disillusioned you need to wake up politics is blind religions are blinded because of the smoke that's coming out of the bottomless pit it was spiritual spiritual devils that have been bound in the river euphrates brother branham said it was that old roman empire and it was being revived again if you've been if you've been awake at all you can tell that the bride is up against a battle of unbelief like never before and there's such a binding spirit that's trying to bind the body that is coming from that realm of the bottomless pit that realm is trying to bind them over the spirit that realm is trying to bind your worship that realm is trying to bind your prayer life that that that smoke is trying to bind the preaching of the word so that the body is so bound that it cannot operate but i'm so thankful that if you just flip the chapter you can look over and see and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven hallelujah he's strong enough to break the disillusion of laodicea he's strong enough he's here to make sure you get it he's here to make sure you get in the rapture he's here he's here to make sure brother uh gets his healing he's here to make sure our young people get a refilling of the baptism of the holy ghost the mighty angel is here and he ain't leaving [Applause] but you can watch catholicism as it tries to creep its way in just let the priest do it just let the preacher do it just let the elders do it just let the deacons do it just let the pastors do it just let the deacons do it catholicism trying to creep its way in the body was to be a body not to be a one-man show you know sometimes i feel like nobody else in the world is helping me preach but i can't do this without you and you can't do this without me we're a body you may think yourself okay but we are a body and we need every person and every person is vital to the body you say i don't feel too important i don't feel like i'm very significant every gift of the body is for you it's with you you say well i feel inadequate and i don't feel like i got gifts like these brothers or gifts like these sisters to sing like these sisters and pray like them brothers we are not perfect without you [Applause] we're a body we're a real team and we know that there is a diversity of gifts but it's of the same spirit we know that there is a difference in administrations but it's of the same lord and there is a diversity of operation but it's the same god which worketh all in all first corinthians 12 and 7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for the one is given by the spirit of the word the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit now i want you to know you can feel yourself inadequate but if you've got enough faith you just saw yourself in a body he said i never spoke in tongues i never laid hands on a sick and they recovered i never seen a miracle done i never seen interpretation i never seen prophecy if you have a gift of faith [Applause] we are a body working on miracles gifts of healing diverse kinds of tongues interpretation of tongues but these i worketh that one and self same spirit it's all laying in the ability to yield it's law it's all laying right there you see i yield myself to preach i yield myself to sing it and you yield yourself to pray you yield yourself to prophesying or laying on hands or believing it's all how you yield yourself i have to have to be honest i and you may disagree with me i don't believe you will but if maybe somebody on the internet might but i happen to believe that the gift that our pastor has is a gift of knowledge and a gift of wisdom to be able to reach into that realm and tell you things that only he would know it's a gift of the body we said well i wish i sure had that i wish i could see a vision brother burnham said you flip up in your bible every day and you're seeing a vision hallelujah if you have enough breath on the inside of your lungs to lift up a praise lift up a shout and yield yourself to a real worship to believe like never before you are setting yourself in motion in the body we all enjoy singing but this doesn't work too well without a piano player now i might be able to carry a tune and maybe a half a bucket but when the music gets to play it begins to ring out a whole nother level and breaks an atmosphere so we can't do this without one another it's all where you yield yourself you say well i you know i'm gonna take his ear right here i'm gonna put it down here on my nose so that i can hear people better they say well no way you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna stick my nose right up here in front of my eyes so that i can knows in people's businesses better you'll find that you're not being very successful when you move parts of the body around but when you allow the body to operate as it's supposed to operate and not get into the flesh not get in the flesh of man i wish i could do that just step back just just take a deep breath breathe in breathe out you got the holy ghost you can raise your hands if you do if you've got the holy ghost you have been given the greatest gift hallelujah he said that that group the church had been bound there for 2 000 years for 2 000 years at the river the demons have been bound there's a river euphrates he said but the church had been bound at the doors of dogmas and creeds he said but she is going to be liberated and she's coming back hallelujah you can shout i'm not bound you can shout i'm operating where i'm supposed to you are where you need to be at this message is everything you have need of he's your answer he's your god he's your all in all he's your everything he's your bright and morning star he's your alpha he's your omega he's the author he's the finisher he's on everything oh hallelujah hallelujah he said god hates a powerless religion it's got to have power in it it's got to have sincerity and sincerity brings power sincerity brings real worship not forms but genuine power worship to know that you pass from death unto life but god wants to perform his word by his power it's well i'm hungry i'm hungry i'm hungry to find my spot i'm hungry jesus said blessed are them that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled there's a real power in hunger and if you get hungry enough you'll go to seeking out for some food brother branham said that that even a a hungry child will eat from a garbage can if they have to i can't imagine getting that hungry he said but the only reason he does that is because he's not been invited to a clean table hallelujah the invitation is here you can eat up here where the table is spread and the feast of the lord's going on you don't have to live in trance you don't have to live in a dead state where you wonder well i will i ever feel the anointing will i ever feel the spirit move again he tore the veil that day at calvary so that you could be liberated there is a liberty in the body of jesus christ you don't have to stay where you're at you don't have to stay in sin you know i should stay in sickness he tore down that veil he tore it apart he tore down the veil of sickness he said i am the lord thy god that heals your diseases by my stripes you are healed he tore down the veil of glory he tore down the veil of fear he tore down the veil of sin he tore it down all it is is laying there is a barrier to be broke you remember when the prophet would tell us about that plane that would give if he could ever get past that sound barrier that he could fry it could fly freely it could fly and have no limits on it if it would get past that uh it would get past that cell barrier it could fly and it was limitless what it could do and he would say he said if you could only get past that sin burial he said you would fly into the promises of god fly their words limitless fly where all things are possible but let me say something to you that barrier of sin has already been broken the blood of jesus christ has broke down that middle wall of partition the blood of jesus christ has broke that barrier but there is an element or a barrier in the human element that makes a barrier there and that element is remembrance and if you can ever get past the barrier of remembrance you'll walk into the promises of god into the place that god ordained you to be if you'll just get hungry enough i'll tell you i i ain't never got enough of this i go to sleep eating i eat it in my subconscious i dream about this message i think about this message i wake up eating this message i do it all day long i feed on this message why because there is a hunger who put that there did my daddy do it did brother homer do it did one of my best friends or the greatest ministries that i've been a part of brother tim pruitt did he put that there who put that hunger there now i'm just identifying myself in a quote right here but if you can ever get yourself so hungry you'll break past yourself emily you sung that song break down break through break in if you could ever just break in you get hungry enough for worship you'll start worshiping now notice i'm telling you when you break that traditional barrier that jesus is way back and he isn't now when you find he's the same yesterday today and forever there's no limit to what god could do right here when you break that traditional barrier there's no limit to what god can do right here in this convention and show this world what they need not a world's fair but a world revival they'll be filled with a baptism and baptized with the presence of the living god and morphy invalid himself into a human flesh hallelujah i believe broken every barrier every veil every veil nothing could hide his presence he said when the people gets hungry in their heart there's a veil that's ready to be broke you can just depend on that that's a prophet's word nothing could hide his presence when people gets hungry in their heart there's a veil that's getting ready to be broke and here he stands what's that that you feel what's that's making this this body what's making this body move what's making this building all milky all over it's because he's standing right here i sent a quote to my dad yesterday where brother branham is he is there and he's coming down to the end of the service and he said the building it's like it's just breathing like the building's just breathing what is it what is it that's happening here he's standing right here nothing could hide his presence nothing can stop him from getting to you if you just get hungry i want more of you god i need more of you god feel my spirit god live in my soul god not anoint me like never before god take me into the realm of the believer like never before god he's standing right here he's moving you into that spot that you were ordained to be in he's standing right here satan has done his very best to curse this body i'm going to speak some things personal and i'm going to speak some things to the body itself satan has done his very best to curse this body he's done his very best to curse our pastor he's done his very best to stop the move of god he's done the very best to stop and limit god's power he's done his very best to curse us but i'm reminded i'm reminded that i will bless who blesses you and i will curse who curses you i've made a name for you in all the families of the earth shall you be blessed when satan has cursed you he's riding with a greater curse on him to hell curse me all you want to the more i'm blessed try to stop me all you want to the more i prevail you think about the curses that's come from that realm that demonic realm that tried to stop the ministry at this pulpit just think about those cursings think about that cancer and all of its power and all of its fear and all of its sports but it ain't nothing but a bluff it ain't nothing but a bluff but you were built to get past that think about all the curses but you think about all the blessings here and in internet land you think about all the blessings that's come forth from the ministry in this past year i'm not just speaking to brother ron i'm speaking about a united body that is speak that is speaking and preaching on another level i've been a part of the ministry for over 10 years now and i have never ever seen a move of god like we're seeing now it's the final sweep i begin to think about this and if you ain't listening to sunday morning service and on easter morning at brother tim's you need to go listen to it but i can begin to think about this thought on the cursings of satan how that he's tried to curse a body and i began to think about god using a body that had been cursed by satan to not live but god anointed to speak you're going here that there was a gift of tongues that spoke out across the congregation you heard it and then there came an interpretation directly after it and the best that we have and the people that have stood around this came from a body that had been cursed by satan himself but god was so willing to bless a body and use a body so that it would operate in the realm that it would ordain that body i'm not lifting up a body i'm not lifting up a person but i'm lifting up a body when satan tried his very best to curse elena butts and send her to a premature grave god had bigger plans you can curse all you want to but god has decided to bless and this word came forth hear ye my people you can try with all your might but until you surrender yourself to god you will not walk in victory but once you give yourself over to me i will pour out a blessing that you cannot contain what is it it's all about surrender and yielding yourself over have you surrendered have you fully gave over have you fully been overtook have you fully been moved into a realm of the believer then prepare for a blessing that you cannot contain i don't believe that the blessings were in this world i believe it it is for the land of the living where we unite with our headship where eye every eye will look upon him and there she stands standing with him standing with him robed in the garment not spotted but blameless holy and pure there she stands because he stood for her hear ye my people hear you my people you can try with all your might but until you surrender yourself to god you will not walk in victory until you surrender you won't walk in victory but once you give yourself over to me but once you give yourself over to me completely yielded completely surrendered completely dedicated completely committed i will pour out a blessing and you cannot contain it hallelujah i'm gonna preach this until i see walls fall i'm gonna believe this until i see it manifest i'm gonna speak and watch mountains crumble i'm gonna sing when i don't feel like singing i'm gonna do what i'm called to do and if you don't want to get on the train with me prepare to be left behind because i ain't gonna stop for your humanity i'm not gonna stop because your passion don't match my passion i'm gonna live this message i'm gonna preach this message i'm gonna be me i'm gonna do me

have the power of our headship in the body give the lord a handclap of praise let the musicians come come on somebody go to praising i will not be conformed to worldliness i will not be conformed to ideologies i will not be conformed to man's ideas but i will conform to this word and the image of the son of man [Applause] it's time to arise and shine shake yourself samson shake yourself you're
