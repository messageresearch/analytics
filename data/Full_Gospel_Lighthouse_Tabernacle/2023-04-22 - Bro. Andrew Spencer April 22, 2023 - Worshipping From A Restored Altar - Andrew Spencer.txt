our in our walk with you Lord may you come by our way Lord and minister to us Lord we feel you coming by our way and touching on our hearts Lord and how pressured it is Lord for us to be gathered together with Saints of like Precious faith that you have come to worship with your children to begin to extol upon them the very the very love that you have Lord I pray God tonight that under the sound of our voice Lord that you would begin to minister through the preaching of the word father I believe that you're still a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart I still believe that you saved by the preaching of the word I believe that it was in Acts 10 and 44 that while Peter yet spake these words that the Holy Ghost fell I pray tonight let it be said over in 2023 that while Andrew spoke these words that the Holy Ghost fell Lord I pray God that you come and look up our our sacrifice that is upon the altar may you come Lord and take the tongs and take the cold off of The Altar and place it upon our lips Lord Jesus that we could offer unto you a sacrifice that is due to your name with so love and appreciate you tonight ask God he administer to us help us do a good job and get out of the way just now both speaker and hearer Lord we love and appreciate you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if you have your Bibles this evening would like to look over you in the in the Old Testament they are into Malachi chapter 4 and verses 5 and 6 and then also down to First Kings First Kings chapter 18 and verse 17. man Malachi chapter 4 then First Kings chapter 18. just want to make mention that we we really enjoyed having the the youth testimony last last Sunday night and there were some others that were able to come and be a part of that and share even their testimonies and we had a three-hour testimony service there and that Lord really got behind it and we've seen some very Dynamic and Powerful things amongst our young people and we're just we're just very thankful for what the Lord is doing and and we just appreciate him amen Malachi chapter 4 and verse 5 and I know it's very familiar to you but we want to read these things and this is this is where we want to gather our thought from tonight Malachi chapter 4 and behold I will send you Elijah the prophet notice there's three people automatically right there I the Lord will send you Elijah prophet and we believe that William Branham fulfilled this portion of scripture before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and notice and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse notice every single time that a child is born it carries the nature of its father so notice there is power in the Turning there's very much very much power in the Turning of the heart first king chapter 18 and verse 17 and it's very lengthy lengthy reading here tonight but I trust it'll be okay with you tonight and it came to pass that when an Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth Israel and he answered I have not troubled Israel but thou and thy father's house in that you have forsaken the Commandments of the Lord and thou has followed Balaam and then amazing that the backslider is called or calling out to Israel or to Elijah and saying are you the one that troubling Israel but here was the one that was troubling these things it was thyself and thy father's house in that you have forsaken the Commandments of the Lord and thou has followed Balaam now therefore sin and gather to me all of Israel unto Mount Carmel and the prophets of Baal 450 and the prophets of the Grove 400 which eat at Jezebel's table so Ahab was sent unto the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together under Mount Carmel and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if Baal then follow him and then people and the people answered him not a word then Elijah unsaid unto a light then said Elijah unto the people I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord but baal's prophets are 450 men and the best of men at the end of this are just men but this is a prophet unto the Lord let them therefore give us two Bullocks and let them choose one bullet look from themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood and put no fire under it and I will dress the other bullet and lay it on the wood and put no fire under it and call ye upon the name of your gods and I will call on the name of the Lord and the god that answers by fire let him be God and all the people answered and said it is well spoken and Elijah said unto the prophets of bell choose you one bullet for yourselves and dress it first for you are many and call upon the name of your Gods but put no fire under it and they took the Bullock which was given them and dressed it and called upon the name of Bell from mourning even until noon saying oh Baal hear us but there was no voice nor any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made and it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a God either he is talking or he is pursuing or he's in a journey poor poor Adventure he sleepeth and must be aware awaken now notice I want you to I want to just draw your attention just for a second I know I've got you standing but I want you to draw your attention notice these these actions that these Baal worshipers are in notice it looks a lot like a what what we would call as some called Pentecostal there's a lot of shouting there's a lot of dancing there's a lot of screaming there if you'll notice they prophesied all day long this is an all-day event and it came to pass that at noon that Elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is God either he's talking or he said cry aloud for he said God either he's talking or he's pursuing or he's in a journey or pure Adventure he's sleepeth and must be awake and they cried aloud and cut themselves after the manner with knives and Lancing still the blood gusts out upon them and it came to pass that when midday was passed and they prophesied into the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded and Elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down may God bless his word he may be seated here in the presence of the Lord and I'm going to continue on continue on but I didn't want to leave you standing notice that last verse in Elijah verse 30 and Elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down and Elijah took 12 Stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord came saying Israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order and cut bollocks and pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels of water and pour it on the board's sacrifice on the wood and he said do it a second time and they did it a second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time now I want to do all this to your attention there ain't been rain for three and a half years where's Elijah getting this water out and the water ran around about the Walter and he filled the trench also with alter and it came to pass at the time of the offering notice of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Jacob let it be known this day that thou art God and Israel and and that I am thy servant and that I have done all of these things at Thy word Hear Me O Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and thou has turned their heart back again there is power in the Turning thou has turned our heart back again then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and said the Lord he is the god the Lord he is the God by these scripture readings tonight I would like to speak to you on a thought that the Lord has placed on our heart on worshiping from a restored alter worshiping from a restored Altar and we recognize that here at this church that we recognize the very the very sacredness of the altar it's a very special spot and I believe that I believe that there there's a lot of people that want to do away with altars but we believe in an altar and we know that the altar is a place of prayer it's a place of worship it's a place where men bow down and I thought the song that India is saying was fitting that they kneel down people kneel down and begin to talk to almighty God and lay out their petitions before almighty God because and they they recognize that there is a faithful God that still answers you see the altar was not made for flowers but the altar was made for man and there and I'll just say that there there there is a lot of things and let me preface this service tonight and saying this that I still believe in altar cause and I still believe that God still finds you here at an altar and I know that there are some things and it's wonderful when you can have somebody that can come and be your friend or somebody can lay your hands upon you or their hands upon you and pray over you but there are certain things that just cannot be done like it's done at an altar and I believe that there are some things that you just you know there's a lot of things that I can pray over you and I know it's encouraging when a man of God comes and he begins to speak a word of encouragement over your life those are a lot of those who do you great things but in the midst of your trials there are great things that are garnered from the time that you spent at the altar call where you are setting there and you were praying to almighty God now William Branham you'll find that sometimes that brother Brandon would say that he didn't believe in altar calls it wasn't that he didn't believe in altar calls he didn't believe in the way that men were operating in those altar calls and they were trying to push people and call people and beat them when they got them down there they'd be try to beat the Holy Ghost into them but that's not how you get the Holy Ghost into anybody but there's a lot of people that want to do away with an altar but I'm a Believer in an altar night because there's something sacred about bowing on your knees and worshiping almighty God and recognizing that God's not wanting flowers on the altar God is wanting you upon the Altar and there's a lot of times that brother random would say he said what's wrong with America today is that they took the altar out of the church and they put it down in the basement he said in the only he said the biggest problem of is that is that the only fire that they got left in the house of the god is down there in the basement he said what we need is an old-fashioned Holy Ghost Pentecost and Upper Room experience where God can pour out the Holy Spirit you see an altar it isn't necessarily necessarily made out of one certain material but you go throughout the Bible and I just want to lay some things out here tonight that that when you go to studying out the the word altar throughout the Bible that it's mentioned over 321 times throughout the Bible and an altar could be made out of certain different materials or different things it was a place it could be made out of the table or it could be made out of wood or it could be made out of huge stone or stones and many times you'll find that in the Bible that that men took Earth or turf and they built an altar there and you'll find that in the Bible that it was a place of which offerings were made unto almighty God and there's a lot of people that don't they they don't believe in altars anymore but it is the point that I want to bring out to you tonight that if we shouldn't have altars in the Church of God then why is Satan imitating by a heathen worship my false gods that they bring up their altars and they sacrifice under their Heathen Gods so we recognize said there's real power in an altar so we recognize that an altar was a place where a sacrifice had to be made out you'll find that the very first time that you read in the Bible the word altar was when Noah had come out of the Ark when he'd been up there all of them days been up there waiting for the water to dissipate away from the ark that they are that Noah began to worship God and he began to clean and bring a burnt offering of every clean beast and every clean foul unto the Lord God Almighty you'll find that Abraham and Isaac believed and they built altars through the Lord and they would have constructed many times they would construct them out of the Earth or they would construct them out of stones and at times it simply said in the Bible that they built an altar unto the Lord and at other times they built an altar and then they called upon the name of the Lord he the way an altar is a spot of worship you see an altar would be appeared in many times resurrected of drawing near to almighty God of which sacrifice is the basis there it's a wonderful thing to have an altar but the thing about an altar is its calling for a sacrifice is that right there's a lot of things that are in there that are laying there on an altar but the thing that God is wanting on the altar is a sacrifice so what God is saying is that that I don't just want an altar but I'm wanting worship I want to sacrifice because if an altar is all that it takes then Cain was justified in having an altar call is that right and Abel he they both do the same thing they both wanted to worship God but you see God requires more than just an altar because Cain built an altar on the almighty God but God wanted more than what Cain was putting upon the altar but Abel caught a hold of a revelation that what God wanted upon the altar was not the fruit of the land or the flowers of the land but he wanted a sacrifice and Abel caught a revelation that it was blood that brought them out of Eden and it was blood that would take them back into Eden so Abel caught a revelation but here is Cain here is Cain and he's worshiped this is true worship this is true worship he's got an altar he's got a sacrifice upon the altar but the thing was Cain was not willing to go where Abel was willing to go you see because if you'll study out in the Bible is that Abel died on the same altar that is sacrifice died upon Him Cain came the same exact way but yet God didn't he didn't come God's provided way he said right he didn't come God's provided way and I want you to know that God will never take what you don't put on the altar God will not take what you do not put on the altar if you want your life to be blessed place it upon the altar if you want your family to be blessed place it upon the altar if you want your business if you want all of these things place it upon the altar you see him many times people say well I don't see God working in this area of my life have you really sacrificed that to almighty God is that right you've got to tap into a channel where Abel tapped into a channel and the Bible said that by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain because you see God had obtained he'd obtained a witness from almighty God Hallelujah now notice what brother Madam said in a very powerful message on you must be born again he said now the approach to this birth he said there is an approach and he said the approach to this birth he said you've got to go through a process he said just like anything that lives anything that lives has got to go and die first he said you cannot keep your sane Spirit you cannot keep your same habits you cannot keep your same old thoughts you've got to die you've got to die like Abel died you've got to die on The Altar like Abel died with his lamb you've got to die with your lamp now who's your lamb it's our Lord Jesus Christ he said you've got to die you've got to die to your own thinking to be born to his thinking he said let the mind that was in Christ be in you he said you've got to think his thoughts so you cannot think your thoughts but you've got to think Almighty God's thoughts because you see if all you've got is intellectual thoughts are your faults then it's going to get you into trouble and intellectual thoughts or intellectual religion will always fail you intellectual faith will let you down but I want you to recognize that God will never let you down you see there's always two seeds he was Cain and Abel he was Esau and Jacob he was Jesus Jesus and Judas it's Christ and the Antichrist so it's always two seeds there's an intellectual faith and then there's a real genuine faith that is born by a new birth under the holy ghost that gives you a true genuine faith that doesn't waver and it doesn't move off of it but you see intellectual faith will let you down how do I know it let you down it's because I tried it before and it always let me down but whenever I got into a source whenever I got into a source of faith it never let me down I tell you what an intellectual faith is it's like going down and buying something from a Dollar Tree for a dollar you know that you only bought it for a purpose that it's going to last you for so long because if you go down there and you buy a shovel at the Dollar Tree it's only going to last you maybe through half a job it's like you going down there and trying to buy somebody buy a car or buy furniture down there to Dollar Tree it's going to let you down when Thanksgiving rolls around and you're sitting on the Dollar Tree Furniture it's going to let you down and if you're setting upon an intellectual faith that intellectual faith is going to let you down but if you got a real genuine Faith like Abraham had Faith then it'll never let you down well there's a lot of people say well brother Andrew how do you know how do you know if you got an intellectual Faith or if you've got genuine Faith you test it out just like Abraham tested out his faith when he laid Abraham when he laid his son Isaac that he waited for 25 years and now he's in the age scrap age gap of 12 to 15 years old and God's asking him to lay his Isaac down upon the Altar and you find out whether you got real Faith or intellectual Faith right here because God God is going to test you out and see if you've got real Faith here or not so he takes Abraham upon a mountain of Mount Moriah and he asked him to lay Isaac down upon the altar but Jehovah was so to him that I am almighty God you see me at the intellectual brother made him said in a message on Abraham's Covenant he said you see he said but don't both of those faiths was trying to go at work he said in a fairly intellectual Faith was trying to work there and he said now what is Sarah going to say when you get back home and you sacrifice to Isaac he said my dad he said on the other side he said there was a little buzzer on the inside of Abraham that was saying that I am Jehovah I can provide if he can make me a young man when I was an old man without hope without anything in my body without strength in my lungs where I couldn't produce anything if he can produce that in me he can produce an Isaac again what was he showing is that Isaac was showing that he was as obedient as his father was obedient let me tell you young people Isaac will show you a real type of genuine Faith he didn't get down there and say hey I'm too young to be religious he didn't get down there and say well I've still got some more times where I got to go out and listen to rock and roll music but it was simply obedient to the call to make a sacrifice hallelujah hallelujah you see he was willing to put him on the altar because he knew Jehovah would back him up now notice that when Moses goes in there and he lays out the Tabernacle of the congregation notice that if you go to studying out in Exodus 40 and 29 that he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the Tabernacle so it's important what you see when you enter into the house of the Lord well let me put it in in this way it's important what God sees when he enters into the house of the Lord God don't want to see a bunch of mimicking people or people trying to imitate he wants to see a real altar I'm gonna go ahead and drop it to you God ain't necessarily wondering about this altar he wants this altar he wants this altar you see now the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ is the door so if we're going to come to worship then we've got to gain access through the door and we know that when you see a man and he's sitting there and he's knocking on the door what is he trying to do he's trying to gain entrance because God or somebody is wanting to come in that's the reason why he's knocking now brother Brandon preaches a very powerful and a very key message if you haven't listened to it in a while go and listen to a key to the north but brother random is laying out some real fundamental things to the key to our hearts and the key to the door and he tells us about different rooms in there but he goes in there he lays some things out I think these things are wonderful that brother random said he said now if a man is trying to accumulate knowledge what does he do he goes down to a place where he can get some books or he goes down there where he can get some learning so he goes down there so he can get some teaching and when he gets down there and he sits under that for a while he begins to accumulate what he went in there for he had the key what was it there was a teacher back there that opened up a book I remember there were some teachers that I absolutely hated but there were some teachers that I absolutely loved they knew how to make reading fund they knew how to make math fun and all of those things what was it they had the ability to turn the key and I think it's a wonderful thing that we have god-given teachers in this hour that have the ability to unlock a key not just for the knowledge but to show a real example and exemplify the very power of the message but notice he said he said what he was he said what he was doing he was down there accumulating what he went in there for he said it's like a person that wants to go into a place and they're wanting to learn piano or they're wanting to learn a certain instrument he said you what they do he said they go to a place and they try to get some lessons maybe they'll go down there and try to get some lessons for a long time and they never catch the key or the mystery of it because it was never unlocked to them I had sister Cassie try to teach me how to play piano many many years ago and I found out real quick that I didn't have the key to it because I was all thumbs and I never could make them cooperate but you see there was something that I couldn't unlock but yet she tapped into a channel because there was something on the inside of her that told her to accumulate these things because God wasn't just giving her a key to open it up for that world he was giving her a key to open it up for this world so that she could worship from a door that had been unlocked now let me say something you didn't come here this weekend just to accumulate some knowledge or to accumulate well I went to church again this weekend you come here to accumulate some real Faith to accumulate some real Revelations where you could come here and say I got what just what I came for from the Lord I come in here expecting and the preacher turned the key to the door I tell you what it was Peter locked that door open the key on the day of Pentecost and the doors wide open for you tonight if you want revelation the doors wide open for you tonight if you want the baptism of the Holy Ghost the door is wide open for you tonight you see what you come for is to accumulate something from the heavenlies that's why the message is so important in this hour is because the message didn't come and be form us it came and transformed us and that's the problem with religion of the day we want as many people as we can get in there that's what the churches want they look at numbers but we're not looking at numbers we're looking at the altar we're looking at the people let me tell you this this altar right here is no good unless you're here church building is no good without you here this microphone is no good without somebody operating behind it but if there's somebody that's got faith enough to turn the key hallelujah what is it God's wanting an altar and you cannot build an altar upon your past that's a problem with so many people today they try to build and alter upon their past but God's not asking for you to be reformed God's asking you to be transformed that's why Paul would say in Romans chapter 12 and 2 to that that to be not just changed in your mind not to be conformed to the world but to be transformed by the renewing of your mind you see you cannot build an altar upon past Church relationships or past church reputations but you've got to build your altar upon thus saith the Lord if you're building your altar if you're building your sacrifice upon your failures or somebody else's failures you're not going to have true worship but what God is wanting is somebody that is worshiping him from a heart that's been redeemed notice you go to studying out these altars throughout the Bible that there was the Brazen altar and when you go to studying out the Brazen altar if you looked at on if the worshiper went out there and he looked upon that Brazen altar if he's seen there was no blood upon it he was a sign of judgment to the worshiper but if the altar had blood upon it he was not just judgment to him but was it was reconciliation to the worshiper or that it was the worshiper had been reconciled so let me say that if you're worshiping god without the blood you have a powerless religion the only way that God is ever going to accept your worship is has got to come through the broken blood cell of almighty God young people hear me loud and clear you can shout you can scream but if there's no blood on your altar if there's no blood on your altar you're shouting does no good come on somebody your emotions do you no good if there's no blood on your altar but thank God there is a token that tells us that full obedience to the word of God entitles us to this broken blood cell the only way that God wants to worship if this if you're worshiping him not through the blood of a red heifer but through the blood of the Lamb of God that has the ability to change your nature roll away your sins and make you a new creature in Christ Jesus Hallelujah but when it come time at the evening time in Mount Carmel when this nation I want you to catch these spiritual thermometer that that Israel was in the nation was polluted they were worshiping under a backslidden king and they were there under wicked wicked idolatrous Jezebel that had brought in that had brought in nation brought into the nation wrote it under idolatry and under false worship notice what Jezebel had the power to do you think a woman don't have power in office watch what Jezebel did Jezebel turned the hearts of Israel from Jehovah this woman had so much sin in her life that she turned all of Israel against Jehovah so that's why it was key importance that God would send the spirit of Elijah to go down there to Israel and turn the children's Hearts back to Jehovah you see Elijah had to come into all of this chaos I hope you hear me preaching to you tonight but Elijah had to come into all of this chaos that Israel was in and he said he had to call for the supernatural to come down that's why Elijah came in this hour when there was so much chaos there was no blood on the altar there was no real sacrifice there was no real worship because the altar had been broke down there was a lot of people that could read the Bible there was a lot of people that could say some good things there was a lot of people that had good points but you know that it didn't ever turn their hearts back but the spirit of Elijah is used over five times in the Bible that God will use the very Spirit of Elijah what does he do it is a restoration ministry under the anointing of almighty God to return the heart of the children to true worship and when Elijah gets up there and he finds that the altar is in this kind of condition what does he do he calls for a supernatural God I'll tell you what he does he calls for a showdown between the gods of Baal and the Lord God Almighty and he begins to say this he said now he said if my God Answers by fire then we ought to serve him but if your God can answer my fire I'll tell you how good Elijah was he said I'll let you go first and they had worshiped all day long and they never got anywhere and they're screaming they never got anywhere and they're hungry they never got anywhere and they're prophesying why because the altar was broke down you can scream you can shout you can CL you can confess that Jesus is your Lord but if your altar isn't restored you can never have fire without a restored altar let me say this young people old people like you can never have the Holy Ghost unless you have a restored altar God ain't wanting this material up here he's wanting your heart it's often hard to worship God in spirit and in truth if you've got a broken altar it's hard to enter into worship when you got a broken altar it's hard to really it's hard to really understand why the moving of the spirit is moving like it is with a broken altar but notice that when the Baal worshipers came notice they came there they made their sacrifice they brought it to a place where they thought was fitting but the rubbish was setting there all around the stones were setting there and they had not been repaired and brother Madam says it over and over again he said now what good is Stones if you ain't got a stone Mason to shake them out he said now what good is it going to do to make a confession he said if you ain't got a stonemation to turn them into a son of God again he would say in Jehovah Jireh he said he's here now Jehovah Jireh has provided for himself he said God is able these stones to rise children unto Abraham he said if these denominations weren't accepted God can bring his children from the streets he can bring them from the prostitutes out of the ends he can raise up anything that he wants to but if God has provided a message there's somebody somewhere that's going to receive it if God has provided a message there's somebody somewhere that's going to receive it he's Jehovah Jireh the Lord will provide for himself a message the Lord will provide for himself a messenger the Lord will provide for himself in his own way the signs to the church not joining not putting her names on the book he said we hear so much today about decisions so many decisions he said what good does it do to pile up rocks if you ain't got Stone Mason there to cut them and shake them into Sons and Daughters of God what good is it going to do for us to accumulate a bunch of people if God can't turn them into Sons and Daughters of God we're not just wanting somebody to occupy a Pew we're wanting real sons and daughters of God that's got a real heart a real Heart of Worship a real heart for God I ain't looking for the biggest a manner but I'm looking for somebody that's got to restore heart that knows how to pull on the gift of God that wants God over anything else in the world take your money and do what you want to with it but give me my Lord Jesus Christ in these young people with vessels that's been emptied out I'll take them over the richest people in all the world give me an altar where there's a real blood opponent foreign but give me Jesus come on somebody take this drywall take the plaster but give me our vessel that wants God I don't care if you're acquired as a church mouse but if you're a man and from your heart I can feel you I can tell you right now when brother Roy and sister Darlene go to move when they start pulling on the gift of God I can feel them it isn't how loud you scream it isn't how loud you worship it's from your heart is that right but the altar was broke down and the Bible said that Elijah came and repaired the altar you go to setting out that word repair it means Rafa it means Jehovah Rapha laughs it means I am the Healer ha him the Healer notice this word in the Greek it means to heal it means to make healthy it means that he's a physician it means that he can take the hurts of Nations and restore them it means that he can take individual distresses and heal them he can take broken water and heal the waters he can take broken pottery and he can heal it Hallelujah if I would take care tonight just to give you a an example if I would take a broken vessel a broken glass and I would pour I would pour different elements together I'd create a fire and I'd make the elements of that glass go back together but you could still see the chips in it and then God comes down and takes a broken vessel and it comes down and he heals The Vessel which one are you more likely to drink from you drink from mine you're going to get cut you drink from the you drink from the vessel then I restored or I tried to work on it you're going to get cut you're going to get scarred it's going to hurt you but if you drink from the vessel that God has healed I don't know if you hear me talking to you tonight but God ain't drinking from Broken Vessels tonight he's drinking from vessels that he's healed that is restored the Bible says that he is near to them that are of a broken heart God knows where to find you that's why we needed Jehovah Rapha in this hour we need a Jehovah Rapha to heal our music heal our worship heal our doctrines heal our Biblical truths we still need Jehovah Rapha Hallelujah the Bible says he heals the broken in heart he heals the broken altar and he binds up their wounds he said well I'm too scarred my past is too big let me tell you if you think you got scars won't you look at him one time look at him one time feel those scars you feel it every single time maybe it's a complex that maybe you thought was fixed but let somebody say the wrong word at the right time and all of a sudden you feel that scar again laughs but I want you to know he is Jehovah Rapha he heals the broken in heart he heals and he makes whole and when God gets done with something it's worth it you may look upon yourself you might still see the scars you still might see the complexes you might still feel the pain but he's not drinking from a broken vessel tonight he's drinking he's not drinking from a broken cistern he's drinking from an Artesian whale in vessels that are filled with the Holy Ghost oh my God the heart is the altar he said not alone this one brother and said he said let us stand our feet just a moment you can never make an altar call in this place of this type he said there's not enough room but your heart is the altar your heart is where God lives again he would say he said now I feel led to do this he said this is an altar call stand up to your feet we have no altar to come to he said but your heart your heart is the altar will you bring them over and over again go study the message he said Lord I'm here and I'm putting myself upon the altar here's the prophet of the age and he puts himself upon the altar the prophet still had things that had to be burned out of his life but too many times we get too religious and think well I've been serving God for all these years I'm just good the way that I am if the prophet had to put himself upon the altar then you got to put yourself upon the altar it ain't just for young people that are going through crisis God's wanting every one of you thank you he won he ain't just wanting your husband he ain't just wanting your children he wants you am I preaching to you tonight he wants you on the altar he isn't wanting the flowers on the altar after that day at Easter time altars are filled with flowers up on top of flowers but brother made him say God don't want the Easter Lily on the altar he wants you Hallelujah he wants you on the altar you see God is only going to take what you sacrificed to him you remember the story about blind Bartimaeus how the legend had said that blind Bartimaeus he couldn't make a living like everybody else so he had these two turtle doves that he trained them to do certain tricks in the alley when people would walk by and they throw little coins in and they'd do little flips and different things and he made a living with those two turtle doves but his wife got real sick one time you remember she got real sick one time and he said he said now Lord if you'll heal my wife I'll offer up these these two turtle doves tomorrow morning if you'll heal my wife and God was as good as blind bartimaeus's sacrifice he honored him he healed his wife he took those turtle doves up there to the place of worship and he offered them the almighty God but you see in that day that didn't have an All-Seeing they didn't have a dog that would lead you around the head Lambs that would lead you around it was his seeing eye lamb that would take him around from Street to Street and his little daughter got sick one time and he said Lord if you'll heal my little daughter I will offer unto you this lamb of which I am being led by I will offer this lamb to you the Lord healed his daughter now you may not feel this but I know I'm right on target and he takes this little lamb and he takes it up there to the place of worship and the high priest knows Bartimaeus he said now look Lord mace I can't let you do this can't let you offer this unto God because this is the Lamb that gets you around let me say it like this it was what he was leaning on it was what he was leaning on to get him through life's journey it's what he was leaning on he said I'll give you a lamb I'll give you a lamb but don't offer this lamb he said but look I didn't know for God hey land I offered God this lamb he said God will provide for me a sacrifice God will provide for me a lamb at just a few days from that moment he was sitting there and people were telling him to be quiet but he heard that Jesus was passing by that way and he screamed out thou son of David have mercy upon me what was it the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world Hallelujah yes well I offered God I offered God my I offered God my life if it healed my granddaddy I offered God this and he took it back off the altar it's time you get it back on the altar I believe there's everybody in this building's not in them on the stream too let's just preach to them every one of them need an altar from the deacons to the pastors every one of us every single day need an altar now ain't talking about making sin making sin or making Grace a disgrace but I'm talking like Paul talked I Die daily you've got to lay yourself down young people you're going through the complexities of life's going through the passage of life when your passions are running at a high steady steady stream and you need a lamb but the Bible tells us in Mark 7 and 21 that from within out of the heart of men perceive evil thoughts and adulteries and fornications and murders foreign covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness and evil eye blasphemy and pride and foolishness all these evil things come from within and defile the man said in the word may flesh he said let your thoughts run pure your Expressions pure live pure be pure now out of your heart an oldest he said out of your heart precedes evil thinking adultery and all these different things he said if that comes out of your heart that's what's in your heart if all of these evil actions it ain't even Facebook no more it ain't even Instagram no more it's what they call these things reals that ain't real at all the people are binding their heart to these things you see those things if it's coming out of you all the time that's all you want to do I'll tell you what this world scares me this world scares me that's all that the mental people of this day are only able to watch it a little 10 second 30 second clip anymore they have no ability to set down and then you come here and said in the house of the Lord and you think why in the world can't my children sit still it's because they've got these little cell phones and I don't know why I'm here let me tell you I get scared by my iPhone by the things that pop up and I know what I got living on the inside of me and I see parrots walking around and letting their children that are five years old having little phones it scares the very fire out of me because I know what Evil's laying there they are so innocent but sometimes we break their innocency by our ignorance to parent them [Applause] I know that if your heart if these things come out of your heart that shows what's there he said but if out of your heart comes righteousness if out of your heart comes peace love joy Oh my he said then it's coming from a resource here that's made up of that he said what is it he said it's made up of the spirit of God that's expressed itself through words and what you say then will come to pass you you see if it's in your heart if it's on the altar then it's got to come forth Hallelujah can he say Amen to the word of God if there's righteousness on the inside of you then righteous will come out of you we've got words of the words of the Prophet or words of the word of God it's got to come out of you because out of the heart the math speakers but you see only at evening time could the Prophet come and repair the off track notice what he did the first thing that he did he rode all those stones back together you see they had their worship they had their screaming but they had no altar the altar had been torn down but it took a prophet to come back and line out how the altar had to be built right that's why it was so important that God would send Elijah in this day to turn our broken hearts back to the faith back to what back to the original seed that all the Mysteries that had been revealed the Loose Ends had been tied up and the fire came once the altar had been restored I'll tell you what brother random said he said inspiration struck Elijah so much that he called down fire and it called down rain in the same day I believe that's why you're here tonight it's because the inspiration of the Lord has come for you to get touched by the fire again but I'll say this if you're wanting it to rain in your life you better get a repaired altar it ain't raining three and a half years your life's been parts you've got dry ground but rebuild the Altar and watch the rain come that's what you got to do is you've got to if you want a Revival you got to repair the altar if you want some real worship repair your heart ah I'm sorry I'm sorry it's the hardest two words to ever say not only to your wife but to almighty God but the reason why David was a man after God's Own Heart was because he was quick to repent and when you learn the power in Repentance even when you don't feel like you've done anything when you don't feel like you're then it is sinning you were born in sin shaked in iniquity repair the altar get blood back upon the altar so you can make a real sacrifice of praise if you want a Revival that is you want to revive at your home don't you mamas you want to revive what's your home don't you then repair the altar brother Burnham said it's too many times that we've sat around and daddies don't pray in the mornings like they used to and mamas don't read their Bibles like they used to but when they come back home after the events of life they say a little bitty simple prayer God bless the Joneses God Bless The Maze it's God bless this one and God bless this one and before long you're slipping off in the sand and you're back into a spot well you're no longer praying no more but it's time I know this is real real Elementary but I'm telling you it's going to take you to a deep spot it'll take you to a deep spot if you can roll those stones of Prayer back into your life roll it back up roll back roll it back up roll holding us back up in there come on somebody roll a real Godly life back up in there row a prayer life back up in the air roll back listening to the tapes again roll back reading your Bible and praying how do I get close to God brother Branham read and pray every day and if you didn't read it right the first time and see Christ go back and read it again my husband's this way my wife's this way repair the altar well my husband don't necessarily enjoy the message like like I enjoy the message what did William random teach us make him an answer show them what it's like to be hungry show them what it's like to be a real Christian he ain't telling you go back on apple pie maybe he got to maybe you got to do that but just live such a life that the rest of the world is thirsty is hungry I have to be honest the rest of the world needs what you got I don't mean to brag but the rest of the world needs what Tom Hill's got the rest of the world needs what you sisters got because what they are lacking is sitting at the throne room of your heart brother random said roll up that stone of Salvation he said I believe that roll up that stolen speaking in tongues I believe that roll up that stone of interpretation I believe that roll up that Stoner Divine Healing I believe that he said Brethren if you do that get ready for the fire to fall he said now I'm just going to I'm going to forget about all your reality theology Lord I'm just rolling up these Stones I'm going to lay myself across the altar oh Lord burn me up don't worry he will get you if you're all alone if you're all alone God still wants you we had testimony service the other night heard people saying they relied on this one and relied on that one let me tell you there's going to tons of times in your life when you can't rely on nobody Friends Are Gonna Let You Down they won't show up they won't pray with you that's proof In The Garden of Gethsemane that friends will never keep you you can rely on your friends and I believe it's great things they're strength and unity that strength in numbers but when you can't rely on your friends when friends let you down when mamas and daddies walk away from you Jesus said I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you he'll be with you even in you till the end of the world he's a friend that's six closer than a brother [Applause] roll them Stones back up there roll them Stones back up there that's why Peter said you're living stones you're a living example you're a spiritual house you're a holy priesthood barium Branham said in stature a perfect man he said God never sent me down here to preach or build denominations but he sent me here to build individuals that they might be a spiritual Powerhouse unto almighty God let me tell you let me go a little bit deeper for you that have been really studying the message we know where we're at we know where we're standing at our altar has been restored we've got the full truth we've got the opening up of the word thou must prophesy again speak what the word says when the altar is right you can call for Fire and Fire will fall you can call for the Dynamics and the Dynamics will fall you can call for healing and healing will come we believe therefore we speak you cannot speak if you have a broken altar or a broken heart the things that are in your heart is the things that you will do and the things that you will say because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speakeas Deuteronomy 30 and 41 4 14 the word is Navi even in thy mouth and in thy heart the word is in you it's on your altar that you might just let it lay down but thou must May us do it the words there the words there it's in your heart it's in your mouth speak the word let me tell you we done rolled up the stones of Divine Healing so I recognize that cancer has no ability to hold me back let me tell you we met an angel in a cave in this age that told us a cancer was nothing almighty God it's already been rolled back up there things are put back in place let me tell you thank God for a prophet if it wasn't been for a prophet meet an angel in a cave we would stand here as a church and be fearful of this thing but because we rolled up the stones of Divine Healing back up there and the fire fell upon it I'll tell you what it's time to do it's time to climb Mount Carmel again and find out if God's still God hallelujah it's time we climb Mount Carmel it's time we go back up here to Pentecost see the god that answers by fire and see if he's the same yesterday today and forever now I know I done told you you can be a church in quiet Mouse Grandma Mouse Squad be here but I don't mind you Amen in the word of God tonight is that right we've rolled up those stones we're not afraid to say Amen we're not afraid of dancing in a church we rolled up them Stones we're not afraid to worship Him in spirit and Truth why because we rode up them stones Hallelujah you're a living Stone you're a living example you're exemplifying what God wants done in this hour let me tell you there's no reason why we can't have healings in this church tonight why because we rolled up them stones I know what I'm talking about we rode up them Stones one night and we got to talking about a quote where William Branham said now you that are dealing with arthritis stomp your feet you remember and I said now you that's got diabetes said you that's got sugar stomp on that thing I know what I'm talking about we rode them Stones up and Jim Noel had dealt with sugar problems ever since a certain thing in his life and when he rode the stone up and recognized that the altar was back sugar diabetes left his body in that service I'm telling you that no matter what you have need of the stones of Divine Healing have been rolled back into place ask let me drop some to you if everything's right here [Applause] everything's right here then you can ask whatever you will and it shall be granted unto you why you rolled those things up but too many times people try to roll them things away and say it ain't for us and there's for days gone by or it's just for the prophet John 14 12 just for the prophet absolutely not the words that I do shall you do also and Greater Works than me say you do because I go into my father while we rolled up them Stones I tell you that we're living an hour where you can know that you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost because Jesus said in John 14 and 20 that at that day you shall know that I'm in the father and the father and me and I and you and you and me I'm telling you young people that you are living in an hour where you can know you got the Holy Ghost why because them things been rolled up I'll tell you right now I feel the Dynamics working in the bride's body and I'm challenging you to believe that all them things are rolled back up the heart's been restored your Faith's been restored you believe that all things are possible because Elijah came and Jehovah Rapha healed your heart William brand I'm standing there in India and there's a man or a boy that comes to him that's deaf and dumb and he said it was like a Mount Carmel Showdown again he's out standing there he said now he said let the god that answers let him be God he said now if your Gods could come up here and heal this deaf and dumb boy you come up here and do it he said but if my God is God let him come up here let him show that he's God William Brenham said he prayed a real simple prayer and he clapped his hands together he clapped his hands together he said that boy pulled on his ears and he was hearing and talking as good as anybody else in the building he said now them people had been Pagan worshipers or Heathen worshipers and he said all they seen was a demonstration of the Holy Ghost and he said they tried to worship me he said they didn't know what they was doing they'd never seen anything like that before he said not the problem was he said is that the word hadn't been rightly represented to them he said the word hadn't been represented to them exactly right he said it only been dead that represented to them in doctrines and in pamphlets and he said now he said I'm a 100 for them pamphlets and for the doctrines he said but it's only he said it's only represented to you in so much you see everything hadn't been shown to them yet so they didn't know how to really worship he said but now I'm showing to you the god of the word is going to back up his word and that boy that was deaf and dumb was completely made whole he said in the next night he said there they LED that man up there by a chain around his neck you know the story what was it it was God showing that the stones of Divine Healing had been rolled back I'm telling you the rollback in these young people's life I believe it's going to be Reagan's and I believe it's going to be India's that are going to take a body change I believe it's going to be some Abigails I believe it's going to be some witness that have rolled back the restoration of the Altar and believe that all things are possible let me tell you you're not a weak bunch of Christians the Bible said in second or second Corinthians 5 and 17 that if any man be in Christ he is a new creature and old things are passed away and behold all things are become new now that don't mean you're some weak some staggering in here just some weak forgiving that you're only just forgiven of your sins but it means you're a new creature it means you've got the nature of God you've been created in Christ Jesus you've got the ability of God our faith has become as strong as our fear was before our change you know what it's like to fear you know what it's like to worry but when you you got changed your faith was as strong as your fear was out there comes to you control because you are born again son and daughter of God you're a new creature in Christ Jesus our faith tells us that we're secure our faith tells us that God himself has put Satan and all of his kingdom underneath of our feet and we are considered by our almighty God and Satan himself to be the Victorious bride of Jesus Christ what is it we've been liberated in our faith we've been liberated in our worship we've been liberated in our praise that's why Peter said you're a royal priesthood a chosen generation A peculiar people you got some Authority about you you got some tenacity about you because God's backing you up I don't believe there's no reason why we can't have missing limbs come back and be restored right here in this service thank you he said you're crazy no I'm not when William Branham comes and he preaches in the fifth seal that there's coming an hour that there's going to come missing on him he said it's going to come to pass he said it's going to come to pass why was he saying these things was because just before he preaches that seal he's dealing with a little girl that's got leukemia and they're got cancer all through her blood cell but William Branham prays for that Lord or girl and he said God recreated the blood cell again what is it God has came in this hour and recreated our faith to believe that all things are possible not worshiping from a Baptist idea you're not worshiping from a church of Christ's idea you're worshiping under the auspices of the Holy Ghost a restored altar a restored worship and restored faith he can recreate the blood cell call me crazy but I believe we can have a cancer-free report call me crazy but I believe I believe with everything that's within me that there's going to be an hour that there'll be this church so drunk on the holy ghost that all of us will be speaking in tongues all of us will be interpreting and one of these moments call me crazy but in this churches of people that are destined for the transition it wasn't just for Enoch it's for me we've got our Stones rolled back in place [Applause] call me crazy but I believe you can live this message call me crazy he ain't seen nothing yet the farther we go and the harder we press into this message the more we find out that every stone has been rolled back it wasn't just for William Branham to lay hands on somebody and they'd be recovered it wasn't just for him to be thousands of miles from his wife when they laid hands upon her and that tumor was gone it wasn't just for him to call down storms and cast them out of existence foreign I'm gonna tell you something the stone of the third pole has been rolled back in place and it's for this body I don't feel no different good because that's where God wants you at is when you don't feel like lightning and when you don't feel like fire that God can come over top of you little Samson and you destroy a thousand for listings God don't need your strength he just wants your restored altar I've been studying all year round on this hanging I'm done I'm done tonight I've been studying all year long on the rain you've been hearing me preach about it all year long but I want to tell you if you've got a restored alter get ready the rain's coming he said well man I wish I could experience a lot of rain you're in it wish I could experience a holy ghost you're in it I want to experience the rain I feel it in this room I feel the anointing I'm feeling persuading I feel it pushy you're in the midst of the Holy Ghost let me tell you you're under the announcement that the rain is coming [Applause] let the musicians come I was reading I was listening this week I heard brother man talking about it he said if you ever go out there I believe it's in letting off pressure he said if you ever go out there he said before a dry ground before Parks ground he said if you get out there before a storm comes he said you can feel the breeze coming he said you can feel the breeze coming I knew I had this laying here in my heart I walked outside before the rain came today I walked out there if you'd have been standing there somebody passed by to the thought I was crazy that's how everybody else does anyway I stand out there and what was I waiting on I was waiting for the announcement to come because I'd already heard that it was coming I didn't heard across my phone that there was a bad thunderstorm that was coming and I knew what the prophet said about a breeze coming was an announcement that the rain was on its way so I stood out there I waited five minutes I waited 10 minutes but all of a sudden I felt the breeze hit me in the face what was it it was the announcement that the rain is here and the wind of the Holy Ghost is moving in this place
