[41:33] i'm thankful for that you know i think
[41:35] about the miracles that god has done in
[41:37] this generation
[41:38] and what he's still doing you know
[41:40] people want to come today and say that
[41:42] you know he can't do it anymore or he
[41:44] doesn't do that anymore that's all gone
[41:46] and passed i don't believe it for a
[41:48] moment
[41:48] because i've witnessed him to be a god
[41:50] of miracles
[41:51] amen you know i i love this the way
[41:54] brother brown would put it he said the
[41:55] days of miracles has not passed as it
[41:58] says the theologians if the days of
[41:59] miracles has passed the day of god has
[42:02] passed because he is a miracle amen
[42:05] doubters say you don't see any miracles
[42:07] no more they say there's so many that's
[42:09] been waiting for their answer to come
[42:10] and many are getting weary and get
[42:12] wanting to give up but there's great
[42:14] news god is still god and he still
[42:17] fights for us amen he's still in the
[42:19] valleys he's still on the mountaintops
[42:21] he's still no matter where you're at
[42:23] amen as he would he would speak to me
[42:25] very clearly this past wednesday he's a
[42:28] healer and he hasn't lost his touch
[42:31] hallelujah what he did then he does now
[42:33] he's still the almighty he's still the
[42:36] same yesterday today and for uh forever
[42:38] his power is still showing up and
[42:40] showing out
[42:42] his power is still healing his power is
[42:44] still delivering amen just a few weeks
[42:46] ago we had a young girl that had fell
[42:48] and broke her arm and the doctors was
[42:50] going to do
[42:51] some intensive surgery on her and she
[42:53] was going to have rods in her arms for
[42:55] about a year and she was brought forth
[42:57] amen that morning actually i would get
[42:59] up and brother tim had instructed the
[43:01] church to to listen to a couple of
[43:03] sermons that brother brother brown would
[43:04] preach on the rejected king and i was
[43:06] listening to it that morning brother
[43:08] branham had brought brought out about
[43:10] david and the uh and the little sling of
[43:12] faith that he had and he said he said
[43:14] and he called the prayer line he called
[43:16] preachers to pray and and he began to he
[43:19] said lord i come in this little sling of
[43:20] faith slingshot of faith and he would
[43:23] drive cancer out with this little
[43:24] slingshot and he just spoke to me we're
[43:26] about to have a prayer line and i'd
[43:28] actually text my father and i said you
[43:30] planning on having a prayer line this
[43:31] morning and he said well it actually
[43:33] crossed my mind well in that prayer line
[43:35] this little girl comes up and we pray
[43:37] for her she goes to the doctor the next
[43:39] day they said no surgery needed amen and
[43:42] bones are back together the way they
[43:44] should be in that moment god healed
[43:46] taste
[43:47] amen nerves were healed pain was healed
[43:50] listen there's healing in the body
[43:53] it doesn't matter how many dies or how
[43:55] many goes on or whatever god is still
[43:58] the healer he's still the liver i know
[44:00] what he can do and i know that he will
[44:03] do it amen so i know i felt it i
[44:06] witnessed it i found him faithful and
[44:08] he's never lost a battle amen as we said
[44:11] this morning there's a one word in his
[44:13] that's not in his vocabulary and that's
[44:15] fail
[44:17] amen he's never failed us he still
[44:20] restores he still heals he still redeems
[44:24] and no matter how many doubters rise how
[44:26] many doubters says it ain't so i still
[44:29] believe

[44:32] would walk down in the valley with david
[44:34] and take god's head off i believe this
[44:36] morning he's going to do it again
[44:39] how many davids are in the building this
[44:41] morning i believe he's here to take
[44:43] david that glides head off and put it up
[44:45] as david did there as we found as we as
[44:47] in israel david would take that head he
[44:50] would drag it all over the kingdom
[44:51] showing what my god did
[44:54] amen and he would actually place it in
[44:56] the place they call the the
[44:58] the mountain of the skull amen and he
[45:00] would place it there because it was an
[45:02] intersection of great travel and he'd
[45:04] put a spear there and he put that head
[45:06] on top of that spear showing god had
[45:08] dominion over this
[45:10] amen it would be the same place that god
[45:12] would come two thousand or a thousand or
[45:14] so years later amen and the little man
[45:17] named jesus and he would come to that
[45:19] same place and be hung between the high
[45:21] the air and the in in the air between
[45:23] the ground and the sky amen and it would
[45:25] show i still have power over this i'm
[45:28] still the same yesterday today and
[45:30] forever i'm here to declare he hasn't
[45:32] lost his touch
[45:34] he's still a healer that blood still has
[45:37] power it's still an effect he's still
[45:40] here to move in the midst amen i'm here
[45:42] to see if john's hair be raised up again
[45:45] and say my god is the same god my god is
[45:49] my god and he fights for me

[46:54] moved in that song a while ago
[46:56] i believe that's what he's wanting to
[46:57] show us this morning he's a waymaker
[47:00] when we can't see away
[47:02] in the darkest time there's ever been
[47:05] as we talked about last wednesday of the
[47:08] dark time
[47:09] chaos all around these two men walking
[47:12] down the road of emmaus
[47:13] wondering what's going on what's
[47:15] happening
[47:16] but it was the day of the resurrection
[47:19] we're also in that day
[47:21] it's in a dark time in a dark place
[47:23] darkness all around us
[47:25] amen we're in darkness but we're not of
[47:27] darkness
[47:30] and there can be someone i believe this
[47:31] morning is going to step out of the
[47:32] bushes
[47:34] begin to tell you what's going on and
[47:35] what's happening and begin to reveal the
[47:37] things all the way down and show you
[47:39] where we're at
[47:41] you know and i thought it was so awesome
[47:42] how that he would come in that place and
[47:44] they had invited him said come here come
[47:47] into this little place brother branham
[47:49] said it must have been just a little mud
[47:50] hut
[47:51] didn't look like much
[47:52] but they invited him in
[47:54] and he said if you invite him in he'll
[47:56] do things for you like you've never
[47:58] witnessed before in your life
[48:00] said he would actually take the bread
[48:02] and the breaking of the bread if their
[48:04] eyes were open amen i believe it was the
[48:07] same one he was showing again i still
[48:09] have the touch
[48:10] he would tear off that piece of bread
[48:12] and another place another piece would
[48:13] take his place and i he i believe this
[48:15] morning he's got a piece of bread for
[48:17] you
[48:18] how many wants to say lord
[48:20] feed me today
[48:22] in this resurrection time

[48:28] weeks and and we're all alone but lord
[48:30] revealed to me you're still among us
[48:33] amen let's sing that as brother tim
[48:34] would come
[48:35] amen i believe he's still working
[48:38] when you don't even see him working

[48:42] moving
[48:43] even while you've been in the darkness

[57:53] christ
[57:54] was in the aisle that is called patmos
[57:57] for the word of god and for the
[57:58] testimony of jesus christ
[58:01] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[58:03] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[58:06] a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega
[58:09] the first and the last and what thou see
[58:11] us write in the book
[58:13] and send it unto the seven churches
[58:15] which are in asia
[58:16] and just ephesus and the smyrna and the
[58:19] pergamos and under thy tara and under
[58:22] sardis and unto philadelphia and under
[58:25] laodicea
[58:26] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[58:28] with me and being turned i saw
[58:31] seven golden candle sticks
[58:34] and in the midst of the seven
[58:36] candlesticks one likened to the son of
[58:38] man
[58:39] clothed with the garment down to the
[58:40] foot and gird about the pabst with a
[58:42] golden girdle
[58:44] and his hand
[58:45] and his head and his hairs were white
[58:48] like wool as white as snow and his eyes
[58:52] were as a flame of fire
[58:54] and his feet likened to fine brass as if
[58:57] they burned it in a furnace
[58:59] and his voice as the sound of many
[59:01] waters
[59:02] and he had in his right hand
[59:04] seven stars and out of his mouth when a
[59:07] sharp two-edged sword
[59:09] and his countenance was as the sun
[59:11] shineth in his strength
[59:13] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[59:16] dead
[59:17] and he laid his right hand upon me
[59:19] saying fear not i am the first and the
[59:22] last i am he that liveth and was dead
[59:25] and behold i am alive forevermore amen
[59:29] and i have the keys of hell
[59:32] and of death
[59:33] amen now you can have your seats
[59:38] i want to say it's a real privilege to
[59:40] be here this morning
[59:41] i have this opportunity to
[59:44] speak to you once more and
[59:46] share the good news
[59:48] that our god's not dead he's a living
[59:50] god
[59:51] and he's present among his people today
[59:54] and we want to thank him for his
[59:56] presence here among us
[59:58] and what he's doing of us and i wanted
[1:00:00] to take a moment here just to especially
[1:00:04] and specifically
[1:00:06] thank you for your your prayers and your
[1:00:09] support and the time of my wife's
[1:00:11] passing
[1:00:12] just in a few days it'll be six months
[1:00:14] ago now
[1:00:15] time flies doesn't it
[1:00:17] and um i receive more cards and
[1:00:20] encouragement from this church
[1:00:22] than any other place in the world
[1:00:25] and although we received a lot of
[1:00:28] encouragement from everywhere and we i
[1:00:30] just want to say thank you from the
[1:00:32] bottom of my heart for
[1:00:34] those expressions of love and um we we
[1:00:38] love you as a group of people
[1:00:40] and um we're just believing the lord
[1:00:42] will just speak to
[1:00:44] us today
[1:00:46] you know um you know as um as we're
[1:00:49] looking at this today um you know we
[1:00:52] we are
[1:00:54] we are in um in a great time a great
[1:00:57] hour where god is doing great things
[1:01:00] among us
[1:01:01] and um you know we
[1:01:04] we have seen him do great work today
[1:01:07] actually i um we're doing a really great
[1:01:11] work as we're hearing the end time
[1:01:13] process
[1:01:14] where the bible said that travel would
[1:01:16] be vastly increased
[1:01:19] and so you know not only
[1:01:22] am i able to come across the
[1:01:24] united states and in a matter of
[1:01:28] uh less than a day and be over here well
[1:01:31] yet at the same time to this moment i'm
[1:01:35] speaking to an international audience
[1:01:38] and so you know the word is going forth
[1:01:40] into places
[1:01:42] that would have been impossible to do
[1:01:45] just a few years ago even
[1:01:48] and so just as soon as i as we speak
[1:01:51] they're hearing it over
[1:01:52] uh we have those listening in from india
[1:01:56] those from south africa today
[1:01:58] and it's not about me actually it's
[1:02:01] about this church
[1:02:03] um if you remember the lord spoke to
[1:02:06] your pastor brother ron if you'll trust
[1:02:08] me
[1:02:09] i'll use you like never before
[1:02:11] and you know we would think in carnal
[1:02:14] minds oh my that means that god's going
[1:02:16] to just really heal him right quick and
[1:02:18] give him a deliverance
[1:02:21] in a miraculous way and that's the way
[1:02:24] that god will really get glory to his
[1:02:26] name
[1:02:27] well you know god's got bigger plans in
[1:02:30] what we do
[1:02:32] and he's allowed him to minister across
[1:02:35] the world and encourage believers
[1:02:37] everywhere
[1:02:39] you can't listen to ron spencer without
[1:02:41] getting up kicking yourself in the rear
[1:02:44] and say getting going
[1:02:46] you know you're not a
[1:02:47] allowed just to sit in your pew and just
[1:02:50] feel sorry for yourself
[1:02:52] and then when you see a man that is
[1:02:54] fighting what he has fought and and um
[1:02:56] dealing with what he's dealing with
[1:02:58] you know so um and then it just
[1:03:01] encourages all to go forward and
[1:03:04] we are encouraged in louisiana by the
[1:03:06] services from this church and around the
[1:03:09] world the saints are encouraged
[1:03:12] and um you know to
[1:03:14] as i as i said that we're
[1:03:17] we have an international audience way
[1:03:19] late at night right now
[1:03:21] um as it's almost midnight there's
[1:03:24] there's little groups of people down in
[1:03:26] india that are listening in
[1:03:29] one of them just wrote me that a few
[1:03:31] weeks ago saying my son-in-law
[1:03:33] um
[1:03:34] mauritius was suffering badly by the
[1:03:38] back pain and in the past for one past
[1:03:40] week he's unable to sit for more than 10
[1:03:43] minutes or and cannot walk
[1:03:46] and today
[1:03:47] i get a report in after prayer that god
[1:03:50] is healed as her son-in-law the doctor
[1:03:53] certified he does not need surgery
[1:03:56] and said this
[1:03:57] is thanksgiving to our healer who still
[1:04:00] does miracles
[1:04:01] amen as brother timothy preached and i
[1:04:04] wish he would have just preached a while
[1:04:05] ago
[1:04:06] but the healer has not lost his touch
[1:04:09] amen
[1:04:11] but you know sometimes god
[1:04:13] heals in in different ways i mean in our
[1:04:15] camp meeting that we just had and
[1:04:17] brother ron was there in the services
[1:04:20] and other ministers ministering but in
[1:04:22] the prayer lines there we had a little
[1:04:25] sister come up with very
[1:04:26] two serious autoimmune diseases and this
[1:04:29] is by no means the only healing that
[1:04:32] took place or deliverance there but this
[1:04:34] is just one of the great testimonies
[1:04:36] from that she had rheumatoid uh
[1:04:39] rheumatoid arthritis
[1:04:40] which was crippling her and she could
[1:04:42] not even this was a young woman and she
[1:04:44] couldn't even put her hands together
[1:04:47] and then she also had a
[1:04:49] a a killer
[1:04:51] autoimmune disease which was scleroderma
[1:04:54] and she just
[1:04:56] reported that god has healed her of both
[1:04:58] she needs no medicine no nothing amen
[1:05:01] she's totally deliberate
[1:05:07] the healer has not lost his touch
[1:05:10] but you know sometimes god heals
[1:05:13] in other ways
[1:05:15] you know we've had um great
[1:05:18] reports come out as
[1:05:20] a men and women that have been healed by
[1:05:23] the power of god as we prayed and
[1:05:26] deliverance has been even in overseas
[1:05:28] countries like south africa
[1:05:31] um those were you know healed of third
[1:05:33] stage rectal cancer a little sister
[1:05:35] there that we sent prayer close to her
[1:05:38] husband hadn't had a job in
[1:05:40] uh three years and god granted him a job
[1:05:44] that had just been waiting for him and
[1:05:46] it was an absolute miracle
[1:05:48] and this was actually the same service
[1:05:51] that sister lana butts was healed of
[1:05:53] cancer
[1:05:54] and um we sent a prayer cloth at that
[1:05:57] same time as we were praying in that
[1:06:00] service and seeing god come on the scene
[1:06:03] and uh but sometimes god doesn't heal in
[1:06:06] in the same way you know there are other
[1:06:08] ways that god heals
[1:06:10] and um i recently i i got a request from
[1:06:13] a little family in
[1:06:15] in south africa their name this is an
[1:06:18] afrikaans name i'm not sure i
[1:06:21] know how to say it your sami family
[1:06:24] they're listening in today
[1:06:26] you know they just reported to me that
[1:06:29] their mother who we prayed for has
[1:06:31] has passed away and
[1:06:34] from cancer
[1:06:35] and of course our hearts go out to them
[1:06:37] for their loss
[1:06:39] and we pray that god will give them
[1:06:41] comfort
[1:06:42] but you know as a believing child of god
[1:06:46] sister mabus
[1:06:47] is not dead
[1:06:49] i mean she just changed dwelling places
[1:06:52] leaving behind the coat of her old body
[1:06:55] that could no longer sustain life
[1:06:57] what is dead is the cancer
[1:07:01] and it was defeated in death because
[1:07:03] remember this god heals all diseases
[1:07:07] all diseases
[1:07:09] and even in death god heals
[1:07:12] and so you know sister mabus is just is
[1:07:15] very much alive and
[1:07:17] as she ever was in fact she's more alive
[1:07:20] than she ever was
[1:07:22] because your senses are greater and
[1:07:24] and uh than those of this earthly realm
[1:07:28] and
[1:07:29] even the scripture supports that they
[1:07:30] can even see into this dimension
[1:07:33] with the eyes of the the eyesight that
[1:07:36] they have
[1:07:37] they can see here just as well as they
[1:07:40] can there and i'll tell you she would
[1:07:43] cry out today don't mourn for me
[1:07:46] you know my theophany body never hurts
[1:07:50] never grows weary
[1:07:51] it never gets tired
[1:07:53] and the place i'm have is filled with
[1:07:55] divine love and everything's wonderful
[1:07:58] and she has joined the the chorus of
[1:08:02] those who are crying out you know saying
[1:08:05] press the battle
[1:08:07] you just don't know what lies at the end
[1:08:10] of the road
[1:08:11] now five years ago
[1:08:14] this month
[1:08:15] i was here
[1:08:17] and we were here for
[1:08:19] the um the funeral of sister christine
[1:08:22] spencer brother ron's mother
[1:08:24] and um if you remember god had spoke to
[1:08:28] brother ron and told him
[1:08:30] there i
[1:08:31] showed him in a in a
[1:08:34] supernatural experience
[1:08:36] of brother timothy preaching on the
[1:08:38] resurrection and the life and
[1:08:40] and me preaching on all thou suffer
[1:08:43] stand and be healed
[1:08:46] and
[1:08:46] you know there at that moment in time
[1:08:50] brother davey went through his very
[1:08:52] difficult trial that he went through and
[1:08:55] god brought him not just a healing
[1:08:58] and a deliverance but gave to him
[1:09:00] children
[1:09:02] and but for sister christine he would
[1:09:05] heal her by taking her out of this
[1:09:07] dimension
[1:09:08] into and put her in a young body again
[1:09:12] and yesterday we were
[1:09:14] here with brother ron and his family and
[1:09:17] and um
[1:09:18] you know at his dad's funeral there and
[1:09:21] and um
[1:09:23] you know i'll tell you as we thought
[1:09:25] about you know what i'm what a soldier
[1:09:28] the cross that he was
[1:09:30] and and everything that
[1:09:33] that
[1:09:33] god has used him for and raised up the
[1:09:36] spencer family to be such a blessing to
[1:09:38] the bride of christ
[1:09:40] and we have been so blessed and by this
[1:09:43] ministry and by what god has done and
[1:09:45] used them for
[1:09:47] and i couldn't help but think back as i
[1:09:50] came here last time that i ministered on
[1:09:53] heaven
[1:09:54] and right after sister christine's
[1:09:57] funeral i came here and i ministered on
[1:09:59] heaven
[1:10:00] and
[1:10:01] you know we spoke about that today
[1:10:03] i'm going to be speaking on the people
[1:10:06] of the resurrection
[1:10:08] as we follow up the funeral of brother
[1:10:11] charlie that god had
[1:10:13] used that great man
[1:10:15] and
[1:10:16] and whatever but now he awaits for the
[1:10:19] resurrection
[1:10:21] and of course you know they
[1:10:23] they are
[1:10:24] blessed ahead of us
[1:10:26] because they raise first the dead in
[1:10:29] christ shall rise first
[1:10:32] and then they will appear to us and then
[1:10:34] we will get our change after we see them
[1:10:38] now so we are a people who are on our
[1:10:41] way back to eden
[1:10:43] and make no mistake about it although we
[1:10:45] have received and one of the greatest
[1:10:48] signposts
[1:10:49] that
[1:10:50] by this message that we
[1:10:52] have that we are nearing that land we
[1:10:56] have not arrived yet amen we still got a
[1:10:59] little ways to go the sign poi post will
[1:11:02] point to the city but the sign is never
[1:11:04] the city
[1:11:06] there's a sign of noah and certainly we
[1:11:08] can see
[1:11:09] as we look back in time and we we see as
[1:11:13] it was in the days of noah we see the
[1:11:15] signposts of sodom and we know that the
[1:11:19] world is in a sodomite condition
[1:11:22] we see this and we see other signposts
[1:11:25] like the we are here where the jewish
[1:11:27] church was when they were blinded and in
[1:11:30] their blindness they crucified the lord
[1:11:33] the messiah
[1:11:35] it was such a dark age and we're right
[1:11:38] now here at a time as they were at a
[1:11:40] time of the resurrection
[1:11:43] there would be the resurrection of all
[1:11:44] the old testament saints
[1:11:47] and now we are here on the very cusp of
[1:11:50] the resurrection of all the new
[1:11:52] testament saints
[1:11:54] but the bride of christ herself is a
[1:11:57] sign in fact we are the last sign
[1:12:00] where the last sign before the coming
[1:12:02] groom
[1:12:03] a bride that is prepared to meet the
[1:12:06] bridegroom
[1:12:07] as brother branham said in the
[1:12:08] identification of christ in all ages is
[1:12:11] god manifested in the flesh now in the
[1:12:14] flesh of his bride for the bride and the
[1:12:17] husband is the self-same flesh these two
[1:12:19] are one
[1:12:20] and the church is becoming the bride all
[1:12:23] the time by believing the word
[1:12:25] so that the word in the church becomes
[1:12:27] the same the word in the church making
[1:12:30] it the bride the last sign
[1:12:33] god identifying himself the word in the
[1:12:37] church
[1:12:38] so here with the word in the church the
[1:12:41] bride of christ is the last sign to this
[1:12:44] generation
[1:12:45] even as jesus would be the last sign to
[1:12:49] the jewish dispensation
[1:12:51] which would be the word made flesh and
[1:12:55] now the word is being made flesh in a
[1:12:58] bright body in the last sign before the
[1:13:02] rapture of the church now there's been
[1:13:04] prophecies and scriptures and promises
[1:13:07] that have been made you know to many
[1:13:09] people down to the ages but we have
[1:13:12] arrived at the place where
[1:13:15] all the fullness of the word is being
[1:13:18] made manifest in a bride people
[1:13:21] so all of them in the ages past though
[1:13:25] you may look at them as history or the
[1:13:27] story of the jewish people it is more
[1:13:30] than that it is a prophecy that is
[1:13:32] prophesying of the day and the hour that
[1:13:35] we're living in and you are they were
[1:13:38] the they were prophesying and you are
[1:13:41] the interpretation
[1:13:43] now as brother branham told us there has
[1:13:45] been churches and churches and brides
[1:13:47] brides but there's got to come one
[1:13:51] there's got to come a real bride
[1:13:54] there must come one that's not only got
[1:13:56] the mechanics but the dynamics of it
[1:13:59] that makes that church live and move in
[1:14:02] the power of the resurrection
[1:14:04] now these end times signs that that we
[1:14:08] see it shows us that we're about to be
[1:14:10] snatched out of here
[1:14:12] amen for it is the eagle age
[1:14:15] and we'll be caught up the bible uses
[1:14:18] that word caught up it means to be
[1:14:20] snatched up
[1:14:21] it literally means to to be just be
[1:14:25] caught up like in the nick of time and
[1:14:28] so the the eagle is the miracle it comes
[1:14:31] out of the heavens it snatches its prey
[1:14:34] uh totally unexpected
[1:14:37] even unnoticed and but yet it'll come
[1:14:40] down in just one moment snatch what it
[1:14:43] has and take it away and this is exactly
[1:14:46] the way that jesus described the end
[1:14:49] time
[1:14:50] and the end time you know again is a is
[1:14:55] a time of the miraculous
[1:14:57] it is and if you don't believe in
[1:14:59] miracles
[1:15:01] you know while the resurrection the body
[1:15:03] change the rapture it'll be nothing
[1:15:06] short of miraculous
[1:15:08] and then this brother brandon would say
[1:15:09] if i can't get the church to even
[1:15:12] believe for divine healing how am i
[1:15:15] going to get them to believe for a
[1:15:17] rapture
[1:15:18] or for the great resurrection of the
[1:15:20] dead or the translation of the saints
[1:15:23] so again there's got to be a people that
[1:15:26] believe in this hour
[1:15:28] now
[1:15:29] you see but where is it the bible
[1:15:31] teaches us he's going to take us out in
[1:15:33] such a way where he'll snatch us out as
[1:15:35] he said um there in thessalonians well
[1:15:39] the the bible speaks that we should pray
[1:15:41] always
[1:15:43] that we would escape the things that are
[1:15:46] coming upon the earth
[1:15:48] amen so he tells us that the end time
[1:15:50] will come like a trap
[1:15:52] which just snaps real quick quickly and
[1:15:55] and it will catch many unawares
[1:15:58] but at the same time in that moment he
[1:16:01] warns us to don't be overcome with
[1:16:04] society and the drunkenness and the
[1:16:06] cares of this life and he warns you
[1:16:09] don't get bogged down with this life
[1:16:11] amen you know and it's easy to do you
[1:16:15] get glued to every kind of news out
[1:16:17] there and you don't even know what to
[1:16:19] believe but what they're saying
[1:16:22] and so many people turn to conspiracy
[1:16:24] theories and you don't know what to
[1:16:26] believe what they're saying
[1:16:28] but you know don't get caught up don't
[1:16:30] get bogged down with everything keep
[1:16:32] your mind when you see all these things
[1:16:35] he said come to pass look up for your
[1:16:38] redemption draw it now
[1:16:40] so he tells you where to look
[1:16:43] there's no need to look at the news
[1:16:45] there's no need to look at conspiracies
[1:16:47] there is no need for any of this look up
[1:16:50] your redemption draws nigh
[1:16:53] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:16:55] he'll swoop down take a people out of
[1:16:58] here and rapture a people in the glory
[1:17:02] and i want you to know today we are that
[1:17:04] people of the resurrection it is
[1:17:07] resurrection out it is translating time
[1:17:11] this is the seventh age where the enochs
[1:17:14] come forth
[1:17:16] are you with me church
[1:17:18] now where is he going to take us
[1:17:20] he's going to take us into heaven where
[1:17:22] we'll have a married supper for
[1:17:24] glorified saints
[1:17:27] amen
[1:17:29] we'll have bodies that'll travel like a
[1:17:32] thought
[1:17:33] and pass through walls
[1:17:35] and appear and disappear
[1:17:38] unconfined by physical restraints
[1:17:41] but the same time be physical enough to
[1:17:43] eat fish and honeycomb
[1:17:47] amen
[1:17:48] but now when you think about going away
[1:17:50] to heaven we're not going to be in there
[1:17:52] very long
[1:17:56] amen we're not staying in heaven very
[1:17:58] long just three and a half years
[1:18:00] while the earth is you know
[1:18:03] while on the earth is the time of the
[1:18:05] the kinsman avenger and he pours out his
[1:18:08] wrath and tribulation and plagues are
[1:18:11] poured out upon the earth
[1:18:13] are you with me
[1:18:15] amen this is exactly this is exactly
[1:18:18] right we're we're here in the hour the
[1:18:19] seventh seal
[1:18:21] where the silence has been broken
[1:18:23] and the prayers of the saints that have
[1:18:25] prayed for his coming is now being
[1:18:28] poured had been poured out before god
[1:18:30] and they come up mixed with the fire and
[1:18:32] come into his nostril and he's and he
[1:18:35] begins his coming by sending a prophet
[1:18:39] restoring the word
[1:18:41] calling the word bride
[1:18:43] so there be somebody to rapture
[1:18:46] and we are in the very process of the
[1:18:48] ending up of everything
[1:18:51] as the seventh seal begins to unfold and
[1:18:53] it just one thing happens and another
[1:18:56] and another like a roman candle going on
[1:18:58] you know it's just one explosion after
[1:19:00] another until it's all fulfilled
[1:19:04] we're living in a tremendous hour don't
[1:19:06] get your eyes off of what god's doing
[1:19:09] don't listen to the fake news out there
[1:19:12] fake news will tell you that god isn't
[1:19:15] god and he's not real and the emotion
[1:19:18] that you feel isn't real why you're
[1:19:20] bumping into angels that's why you're
[1:19:23] screaming that's why you're showering
[1:19:25] those dimensions are coming so close
[1:19:28] [Applause]
[1:19:30] now in the great tribulation of head
[1:19:32] ahead the the vials of judgment are
[1:19:35] emptied
[1:19:36] that stored up wrath
[1:19:38] where god could not punish the horse she
[1:19:40] still had a part
[1:19:42] he could not obliviate her she still had
[1:19:45] a part to play there was still word to
[1:19:47] be fulfilled
[1:19:50] are you with me she has a part in the
[1:19:52] end time
[1:19:53] the great the harlots the whole
[1:19:55] system
[1:19:56] and so they could curse that enemy down
[1:19:58] to the ages i'm sure columba did luther
[1:20:02] wesley all of them cried out against
[1:20:05] that and spoke judgments against the
[1:20:07] false system
[1:20:09] amen against the beast are you with me
[1:20:11] against the false prophet
[1:20:14] but god could not obliviate him so he
[1:20:16] stored it up as wrath in vials
[1:20:20] waiting for the tribulation
[1:20:22] but he's got to get a bride of the earth
[1:20:24] first
[1:20:26] because you are not going to be here
[1:20:28] while he pours out his rats upon the
[1:20:30] earth you're not a part of the wrath
[1:20:34] your part of his coming
[1:20:42] amen
[1:20:43] so there we'll spend three and a half
[1:20:45] years
[1:20:46] while the world is going through
[1:20:48] tribulation we're enjoying the marriage
[1:20:50] supper of the lamb
[1:20:52] this is not fiction
[1:20:54] this is real
[1:20:56] amen and then it'll all conclude with
[1:20:59] christ coming back with his bride at
[1:21:01] armageddon taking the world over for a
[1:21:03] thousand year honeymoon
[1:21:07] amen we'll come right back to this earth
[1:21:09] again
[1:21:11] and there you know for that
[1:21:13] thousand year honeymoon and after that
[1:21:16] he'll have a great white throne judgment
[1:21:19] and their death and hell and satan will
[1:21:21] be thrown into the lake of fire
[1:21:24] and then eden will come upon the earth
[1:21:27] as the new jerusalem comes down from god
[1:21:29] out of heaven
[1:21:31] what am i telling you
[1:21:33] i'm even telling you
[1:21:35] that the intermediate heaven that
[1:21:37] brother charlie just went to that my
[1:21:39] wife is at
[1:21:40] that is an intermediate place
[1:21:43] it's only a waiting place that heaven
[1:21:46] one day will come down to earth
[1:21:52] and i as we as we said satan will be
[1:21:54] thrown into the lake of fire
[1:21:57] and and so will death and hell
[1:22:00] and the grave will all be thrown into
[1:22:03] the lake of fire
[1:22:04] so i want to remind the devil this
[1:22:06] morning
[1:22:07] satan you're only temporary
[1:22:10] you are not eternal
[1:22:12] amen sin is temporary it will have an
[1:22:15] end
[1:22:16] amen evil one day evil you're going to
[1:22:19] come to an end
[1:22:20] but there is no end to a child of god
[1:22:25] amen we came from god and we're going
[1:22:27] back to god
[1:22:29] originally we were eternal in his
[1:22:31] thoughts and we are eternal now
[1:22:34] amen we are not temporary beings
[1:22:40] now the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:42] doesn't make you a son or daughter of
[1:22:44] god it only quickens the eternal seed
[1:22:46] gene of god within you
[1:22:49] and reveals to you
[1:22:50] your eternity
[1:22:52] your eternal qualities
[1:22:55] so
[1:22:57] it's not a time
[1:23:00] not going to be a fun time for those
[1:23:01] that are left behind
[1:23:06] do everything you can
[1:23:08] to be in the rapture
[1:23:10] make that your goal your ambition
[1:23:14] the desire of your heart to live today
[1:23:16] as if he was coming today
[1:23:20] now
[1:23:21] and although we can
[1:23:23] we can feel the hot winds of tribulation
[1:23:25] coming what do you think is happening
[1:23:27] pre-tribulation plagues
[1:23:30] with more and more plagues and viruses
[1:23:32] coming seems like it's endless
[1:23:34] economies are falling
[1:23:37] conflicts with russia and with china
[1:23:39] are rising
[1:23:41] every kind of vileness in our nation
[1:23:45] even uh
[1:23:46] children of rebellion rising up as the
[1:23:48] bible said you know children of
[1:23:51] rebellion
[1:23:52] where they what they they hate
[1:23:54] everything that is god or that's called
[1:23:56] god
[1:23:57] there's no respect for law and order
[1:24:02] amen there's no respect for common
[1:24:04] decency insanity rings
[1:24:07] a man can a man can decide to declare
[1:24:11] himself a female and you don't dare tell
[1:24:13] him he's not
[1:24:16] you know again it's insanity we have to
[1:24:19] we have to pander to their to their
[1:24:22] insanity
[1:24:25] and pretend pretend that it's right
[1:24:28] and we dare not call him her or her him
[1:24:31] when
[1:24:34] when they want to be called the other
[1:24:36] thing
[1:24:39] you see
[1:24:40] but let me tell you the bride is not
[1:24:42] going through the tribulation
[1:24:46] the blood of jesus christ perfects you
[1:24:49] tribulation hey if tribulation would
[1:24:52] perfect you don't you know that the
[1:24:55] dark ages would have perfected the
[1:24:56] people and they went in a rapture a long
[1:24:58] time ago
[1:24:59] tribulation is not and persecution is
[1:25:01] not going to be what perfects you
[1:25:04] what perfects you is the blood of jesus
[1:25:07] christ
[1:25:08] it is our perfection
[1:25:10] amen so a man that chooses a wife he
[1:25:13] didn't put her through a lot of
[1:25:14] punishment she she's already found grace
[1:25:17] with him
[1:25:18] amen or his favor is on her he engages
[1:25:22] to her he loves if anything he'll keep
[1:25:24] her from every kind of trouble
[1:25:26] amen because his grace is so great upon
[1:25:30] them and as brother branham said so will
[1:25:32] the bride and so is it on the bride we
[1:25:36] unworthy creatures deserving of hell but
[1:25:40] his grace holds us through it
[1:25:43] hallelujah
[1:25:45] just think about how many people were
[1:25:46] lost
[1:25:48] when he come by your way
[1:25:51] think about how many sinners there were
[1:25:53] in the world the hour you got saved
[1:25:56] but god saves you for a purpose
[1:25:59] amen and we ought to be determined by
[1:26:02] his will to do that purpose
[1:26:04] don't care what we have to go through we
[1:26:07] want to do it
[1:26:09] now
[1:26:10] originally
[1:26:12] mankind lived in eden
[1:26:15] and he got separated by sin
[1:26:17] because sin
[1:26:19] and sinners
[1:26:21] cannot live
[1:26:22] in eden
[1:26:24] and eden was then closed off to man with
[1:26:27] cherubim's a guarding the way back
[1:26:30] nobody could come back in
[1:26:33] you see eden was heaven on earth that's
[1:26:35] the way the world began
[1:26:37] with eden heaven came down to earth
[1:26:42] the way the world will end this present
[1:26:44] kingdom the way it will end will be
[1:26:46] heaven come back and down to earth again
[1:26:49] so it was there it was a paradise it was
[1:26:52] a time where god came down and
[1:26:54] fellowshipped with man but when sin
[1:26:57] entered man became separated in other
[1:26:59] words he got he died he was separated
[1:27:02] from god and that separated him from
[1:27:04] eden
[1:27:06] sin made him where he could no longer
[1:27:08] live in in eden's paradise
[1:27:12] but god has never given up for
[1:27:15] given up for human beings to live here
[1:27:17] upon the earth
[1:27:19] and earth again will some glorious day
[1:27:21] will be in eden again
[1:27:23] the climax of history will be the
[1:27:26] creation of a new heavens and a new
[1:27:29] earth
[1:27:30] this is when he will make all things new
[1:27:33] amen now not being a creation in the
[1:27:36] sense of we think of creation out of
[1:27:38] nothing but god will take and remake and
[1:27:41] remold this world or this earth and the
[1:27:45] old will pass away and become a new
[1:27:47] creation by the power of the word it'll
[1:27:50] be a resurrected universe
[1:27:56] inhabited by resurrected people
[1:28:00] living with the resurrected jesus
[1:28:05] amen now to do so god's got to have a
[1:28:08] resurrected people
[1:28:10] now not just the resurrection of
[1:28:13] bleached bones and decayed bodies but a
[1:28:15] resurrected people quickened and made
[1:28:18] alive
[1:28:19] and upon this earth will be people who
[1:28:22] make up his bride and who will be with
[1:28:24] him in the new jerusalem and there'll be
[1:28:26] millions of others outside the city
[1:28:30] you talk about grace
[1:28:31] when the fifth seal is open there are
[1:28:33] souls under the altar
[1:28:35] and it revealed things in there you
[1:28:37] couldn't imagine
[1:28:39] you see who had ever thought that
[1:28:42] those under the seal those were jews who
[1:28:45] had been killed down to the ages but
[1:28:48] more specifically by
[1:28:49] you know through hitler and eichmann and
[1:28:51] stalin and that killed six million jews
[1:28:54] and there they were is martyrs under the
[1:28:57] altar
[1:28:58] and they were crying out how long o lord
[1:29:01] how long and they were crying for
[1:29:03] vengeance they were not christians they
[1:29:06] had been martyred but not for the cause
[1:29:09] of christ but for the testimony which
[1:29:11] they held
[1:29:12] amen because they they were jews they
[1:29:15] held onto the faith of abraham that was
[1:29:18] given to him and his seed
[1:29:21] so who would ever thought that there
[1:29:22] could be people there given white robes
[1:29:25] who were blinded because they had not
[1:29:28] known their messiah
[1:29:30] and because of the blindness of this
[1:29:32] condition god in his grace and his mercy
[1:29:37] saved them anyhow
[1:29:41] and what about in revelation 7 between
[1:29:43] the 6th and the 7th seal there's a
[1:29:45] multitude without number
[1:29:48] we think about greats i wonder sometimes
[1:29:50] do we even know grace
[1:29:52] it's a lot larger than you can imagine
[1:29:55] his love is greater than you can imagine
[1:29:58] his mercy is greater than than you could
[1:30:01] ever dream of
[1:30:04] this is a god a god
[1:30:06] that loves a god that cares a god that
[1:30:09] don't want anybody lost
[1:30:13] amen he said he was not willing that any
[1:30:15] should perish
[1:30:16] this was the kind of god that we serve
[1:30:19] amen he's one that loves his people oh
[1:30:23] you know a lot of times we think no
[1:30:25] always just grace on the bride you know
[1:30:27] we're the predestinated we're the ones
[1:30:29] that was in his mind that's not all he
[1:30:31] had in his mind
[1:30:33] amen he had there were there are people
[1:30:35] in the lamb's book of life and there's
[1:30:37] people in the book of life
[1:30:39] and there's a bride and there's a church
[1:30:41] that is called out in revelation 7 a
[1:30:43] multitude without number
[1:30:48] these never received the holy ghost here
[1:30:51] they never drank of the fountains of
[1:30:53] living water
[1:30:55] but here in revelation 7 it says that
[1:30:57] they came through great tribulation and
[1:31:00] he wipe the tears from their eyes
[1:31:03] and he will lead them to life to
[1:31:05] life-giving waters
[1:31:07] amen
[1:31:08] that's how we know him he's a thirst
[1:31:10] quencher
[1:31:11] amen he's the one that that quenches the
[1:31:14] thirst of every thirsty sinner
[1:31:18] amen he still does that
[1:31:20] i think of a of a man there that just
[1:31:22] stumbled into our church here
[1:31:24] recently and never been in church one of
[1:31:27] those unchurched and i drank liquor
[1:31:29] since he was a boy an alcoholic
[1:31:32] in his in nearly 50 years old and every
[1:31:35] day was dr was drinking drugs
[1:31:39] and he comes into this service there and
[1:31:41] comes down to an altar in one moment's
[1:31:45] time is transformed by the power of god
[1:31:48] no longer drinks or dopes anymore
[1:31:52] amen why because god still got the the
[1:31:57] the remedy to sin
[1:31:59] you see a man smokes because he's
[1:32:02] thirsty he drinks because he's thirsty
[1:32:05] he there goes out in pornography and sex
[1:32:08] sins and everything else because he's
[1:32:11] thirsty
[1:32:12] amen they're thirsty for something that
[1:32:15] sin cannot quench
[1:32:18] amen but let me tell you friends you see
[1:32:21] sometimes you think you know grace you
[1:32:23] think grace is all about you but
[1:32:25] remember god so loved the world
[1:32:29] he gave his only begotten son what for
[1:32:32] his love for humanity for all
[1:32:35] amen a multitude without number
[1:32:40] think of that you think you're the only
[1:32:42] one that's going to have eternal life no
[1:32:43] you're not
[1:32:45] i mean you're
[1:32:46] you think you're the only one who's
[1:32:47] going to be on the
[1:32:49] that's going to be on the new earth no
[1:32:50] you're not
[1:32:52] you think you're the only one that
[1:32:54] that's going to be there no brother
[1:32:55] rather said there were millions there
[1:32:58] brother branham told us that he said
[1:33:00] there would be people there you never
[1:33:02] even thought would make it
[1:33:05] some people there you didn't realize
[1:33:07] your testimony or even the testimony of
[1:33:09] your life touched them
[1:33:11] [Applause]
[1:33:12] and in that moment there was a change
[1:33:20] there'd be people there that you didn't
[1:33:22] even know the testimony of your life
[1:33:24] turn them around in their worst moment
[1:33:29] now
[1:33:30] rather than thinking it's just us for no
[1:33:32] more we ought to be a little more
[1:33:33] embracing
[1:33:35] and say oh god save them
[1:33:38] i don't care
[1:33:39] if they just barely make it in they're
[1:33:41] not bride but they're that multitude
[1:33:44] without number i don't care how you do
[1:33:45] it but just save them god
[1:33:48] amen i don't want to see anybody lost
[1:33:50] whether it's my kids your kids
[1:33:53] whether it's a sinner that's so far away
[1:33:54] from god don't never let me get so hard
[1:33:58] that i don't want anybody else in heaven
[1:34:00] but me
[1:34:04] there's going to be a bride and she'll
[1:34:05] be entitled to the new jerusalem
[1:34:09] and there'll be those outside the city
[1:34:11] that'll bring their gifts into the city
[1:34:14] they don't get to live in the city
[1:34:16] but they get to live
[1:34:20] amen so don't give up on them
[1:34:22] so well my grandma she didn't believe
[1:34:24] the message she did the best they knew
[1:34:26] don't give up on her
[1:34:28] put her in the hands of god
[1:34:30] surrender to jesus
[1:34:33] amen
[1:34:34] you know whatever you would say about
[1:34:37] them one way or the other even at their
[1:34:39] funeral wouldn't change their destiny
[1:34:44] amen so why not just put them in the
[1:34:47] hands of a loving god who cares
[1:34:53] why do you have to make the decision
[1:34:56] this is not the time of judgment
[1:34:59] this is a time of mercy
[1:35:02] amen why not put them in the hands of a
[1:35:05] god that's got more mercy than you could
[1:35:07] ever imagine
[1:35:09] that's the kind of god i serve
[1:35:12] a god whose love is so great
[1:35:15] i'm telling you
[1:35:17] a god whose love is so great
[1:35:19] yes there definitely is a bride
[1:35:22] and she is a set apart people
[1:35:27] and if you're part of her by the baptism
[1:35:29] of the holy ghost which is the only way
[1:35:31] you can be bright
[1:35:33] you are a blessed person
[1:35:36] really blessed
[1:35:38] but upon this earth there will be people
[1:35:41] that who will make up his bride who will
[1:35:43] be with him in the new jerusalem there
[1:35:45] will be millions on the outside of the
[1:35:47] city and earth will be so enlarged that
[1:35:50] there be no more sea
[1:35:52] but he'll accommodate them all
[1:35:56] amen there'll be room for them all
[1:35:59] and i just want to say you don't want to
[1:36:01] miss it
[1:36:03] heaven is a real place
[1:36:06] it's a place for the people of the
[1:36:08] resurrection
[1:36:10] it's a
[1:36:11] amen and you don't want to miss it
[1:36:12] brother branham said i can't even
[1:36:14] describe what heaven is really like
[1:36:17] i don't have it in the human language
[1:36:19] sublime wouldn't do it
[1:36:21] nothing i can think of can
[1:36:24] in my vocabulary could even accurately
[1:36:27] describe what it's like but he said
[1:36:29] after being there i can't be the same
[1:36:31] william branham anymore
[1:36:34] amen heaven's a real place
[1:36:37] and brother bradham talked about that in
[1:36:38] the sermon things that are to be he said
[1:36:41] i don't think heaven is a place my
[1:36:43] mother used to tell me about
[1:36:45] i believe the church has grown from that
[1:36:48] to think 100 years ago or so
[1:36:51] the old-timers used to think that
[1:36:53] everyone went to heaven
[1:36:55] had a harp and sat down
[1:36:57] up there on the clouds and played a harp
[1:37:00] and they knew there was a place called
[1:37:01] heaven
[1:37:02] and it but if that be so
[1:37:05] all the musicians would have it on us
[1:37:08] in other words you better learn to play
[1:37:10] something
[1:37:12] amen
[1:37:14] but you see that was a conception he
[1:37:16] said
[1:37:16] before the fullness of the word came
[1:37:19] into existence
[1:37:20] or the opening of the seven seals that's
[1:37:23] promised to us in this age that we then
[1:37:26] understand
[1:37:27] but he said i believe that heaven is a
[1:37:29] real place
[1:37:31] just the same as this is a real place
[1:37:35] for god started us in our spiritual
[1:37:37] growth in this place and i believe
[1:37:39] heaven is a place just as real as this
[1:37:42] where we don't just sit up for eternity
[1:37:44] and sit up there on the cloud and we
[1:37:45] don't just strum our heart from all over
[1:37:48] here ever we're going to a real place
[1:37:52] where we're going to do things
[1:37:54] we're going to live we're going to work
[1:37:57] we're going to enjoy
[1:37:59] we're going to life to real eternal life
[1:38:02] we're going to heaven a paradise like
[1:38:05] adam and eve worked and lived and ate
[1:38:09] and enjoyed in the garden of eden before
[1:38:12] sin came in and we're right back on our
[1:38:14] road there again right on our way back
[1:38:17] the first adam through sin taking us out
[1:38:19] the second adam through righteousness
[1:38:21] brings us back in again and justifies us
[1:38:24] bringing us back in
[1:38:26] now let me tell you you don't want to
[1:38:28] miss it
[1:38:31] heaven is a real place
[1:38:33] you think of it a real place where we
[1:38:35] will live we will enjoy we will work
[1:38:38] just like adam and eve worked and lived
[1:38:42] and ate and enjoyed in the garden of
[1:38:44] eden
[1:38:47] now so this present earth or
[1:38:50] you know
[1:38:50] this present earth that we're now living
[1:38:52] in the one we're in right now
[1:38:55] is an in-between world
[1:38:59] touched by both heaven
[1:39:01] and hell
[1:39:05] and earth leads directly
[1:39:08] into heaven or directly into hell
[1:39:14] you get to heaven here
[1:39:16] or you get from earth to hell here
[1:39:22] and this life here affords a choice
[1:39:25] between the two
[1:39:29] for the believer
[1:39:31] this wretched life
[1:39:35] is the closest you will ever come to
[1:39:37] hell
[1:39:41] and for the sinner
[1:39:42] this is the closest you'll ever be in
[1:39:45] heaven
[1:39:48] so the think of that the best of this
[1:39:50] life center
[1:39:52] is the only taste of heaven you'll ever
[1:39:55] have
[1:39:58] so this present earth before it was
[1:40:02] before it's renewed and the new
[1:40:03] jerusalem comes down upon it
[1:40:06] it's an in-between world
[1:40:09] it is touched by both heaven and hell in
[1:40:12] this dimension
[1:40:13] in this realm demons come
[1:40:16] and inhabit people
[1:40:19] demons come and torment people that's
[1:40:22] what sickness is
[1:40:24] it's satan tormenting
[1:40:27] amen
[1:40:28] you know in jesus jail father brought
[1:40:31] his son to jesus
[1:40:33] and and the demon said it often throws
[1:40:35] him into the fire
[1:40:37] and i'll tell you it does the same way
[1:40:40] even today fires a divorce
[1:40:42] fires a suicide fires of alcohol fires
[1:40:47] of drugs
[1:40:48] that's what demons do
[1:40:50] they throw you into the fire
[1:40:52] amen but in this realm the angels come
[1:40:56] amen that's right angels have been seen
[1:40:58] in this realm
[1:41:00] amen not just now
[1:41:02] but through the bible they abandoned
[1:41:04] even now angels have been seen here
[1:41:08] they can live they can walk they can
[1:41:10] experience things in this dimension
[1:41:14] come on
[1:41:16] amen you see
[1:41:18] they're spirits but there's one
[1:41:20] particular spirit that comes to live in
[1:41:22] us it's called the holy spirit
[1:41:25] it's the spirit of jesus so again this
[1:41:28] world is an in-between world
[1:41:30] that is touched by both heaven and hell
[1:41:36] amen so earth leads directly to heaven
[1:41:39] or directly to hell
[1:41:41] and it affords us a choice
[1:41:44] between the two
[1:41:48] now you say what we were chosen before
[1:41:51] the foundation of the world well that's
[1:41:52] true
[1:41:53] but you also have a choice
[1:41:56] you must choose what he
[1:41:58] chose and the truth of it being a
[1:42:01] pre-you know truth of it is being a
[1:42:03] predestinated seed you can only manifest
[1:42:06] what you are
[1:42:08] but the best of this earth is a glimpse
[1:42:11] of heaven
[1:42:12] the worst of this life is a glimpse of
[1:42:15] hell
[1:42:17] and for the christian this present life
[1:42:19] is it's the closest you'll ever come to
[1:42:21] hell think about it
[1:42:24] you're right now the closest you'll ever
[1:42:26] be to hell
[1:42:28] but for unbelievers it's the closest
[1:42:30] they'll ever be to heaven
[1:42:35] now
[1:42:36] you cannot go on pretending that the
[1:42:38] world we know is the only world you'll
[1:42:40] ever live in
[1:42:42] one breath away is another world
[1:42:48] and never forget
[1:42:51] you're that close
[1:42:53] to the next realm
[1:42:56] you might think as a young person i got
[1:42:58] a long life to live how do you know that
[1:43:02] your life can be snapped out in just one
[1:43:05] second
[1:43:07] you don't even have a promise of
[1:43:08] tomorrow
[1:43:14] and i'll tell you
[1:43:16] you know you you never forget
[1:43:21] how close it is you say well i can't see
[1:43:23] it well it's beyond your seat smell
[1:43:25] filling here
[1:43:27] but i want you to understand it's not
[1:43:28] that far away
[1:43:30] it's one breath
[1:43:33] this mortal life is only temporary
[1:43:36] it's a temporary life so don't
[1:43:38] so so don't just go through life putting
[1:43:41] on the dog
[1:43:42] pretending that this is all it is
[1:43:46] you know like you're somebody here
[1:43:49] you're nothing but dust
[1:43:54] as brother brethren said there's too
[1:43:56] many people putting on the dog
[1:43:58] we call it in the street expression but
[1:44:00] what are you anyhow but six foot of dirt
[1:44:04] god have mercy upon you i i don't i
[1:44:06] don't care how you can dress how you can
[1:44:08] act or what kind of home you can live in
[1:44:10] what kind of car you drive if you're not
[1:44:12] born of the power and the spirit of the
[1:44:14] resurrected jesus christ you're lost and
[1:44:16] will go to hell just as sure as a martin
[1:44:19] will go to his box
[1:44:22] but just your choice
[1:44:24] choose life or choose death
[1:44:29] now it's not popular today to preach
[1:44:31] about hell
[1:44:33] we're not supposed to just preach about
[1:44:35] hell
[1:44:36] well you know you know oh my you know
[1:44:40] well god's a loving god but let me tell
[1:44:41] you this loving god has created a place
[1:44:45] called hell
[1:44:48] and it has a beginning and it has an end
[1:44:52] now there's a fire that won't quench
[1:44:54] because god's a consuming fire
[1:44:57] and there's a worm that won't die
[1:44:59] because that's the destroyer and and
[1:45:01] because the soul that is the sinner will
[1:45:04] die the destroyer god will not die
[1:45:10] but there is no such thing as immortal
[1:45:12] life in hell
[1:45:15] you will come to an end
[1:45:17] now maybe a million years later
[1:45:21] but you'll come to an end
[1:45:23] and it's your choice
[1:45:25] you can either choose heaven or
[1:45:28] hell and i just say choose life
[1:45:34] you know brother branham said about the
[1:45:35] door to the heart and the painter pain
[1:45:38] painting the picture
[1:45:39] you know and they painted where there
[1:45:41] was no handle on the outside for jesus
[1:45:44] to turn
[1:45:45] and the critics looked at it and said
[1:45:46] you left off the door handle he said no
[1:45:48] i didn't i did that on purpose because
[1:45:51] the handle's on the inside only you can
[1:45:53] open it up to christ
[1:45:56] and brother braden said he cannot open
[1:45:58] from the outside he cannot save you
[1:46:00] against your will he cannot heal you
[1:46:03] against your will he cannot send a
[1:46:06] revival against your will you've got to
[1:46:08] be willing and open the door and invite
[1:46:10] him in
[1:46:13] you say well i need healing well i'll
[1:46:14] tell you you can sit right there
[1:46:16] unbelieving
[1:46:17] if you want to
[1:46:19] and say it's for others but he can never
[1:46:21] heal until you open that door
[1:46:24] you can say well i want a revival i i
[1:46:27] tell you but i ain't going to act like
[1:46:29] that
[1:46:30] no i i'm not going to shout i'm not
[1:46:32] going to get inspired like that i'm not
[1:46:34] going to get drunk on the stimulation of
[1:46:36] revelation
[1:46:39] you know people call themselves having
[1:46:41] revelation today and has no stimulation
[1:46:43] with it your wines are dead
[1:46:47] amen it don't have any fears
[1:46:50] no spirit in it
[1:46:52] it's done went bad
[1:46:54] true revelation produces stimulation
[1:46:57] it causes the hallelujahs to thank you
[1:47:00] jesus the glory to god it causes tears
[1:47:03] to come down your face it causes your
[1:47:05] hands to go up and worship amen and then
[1:47:09] it translates into a life that you live
[1:47:12] [Applause]
[1:47:14] but don't talk to me about revelation
[1:47:16] you have no stimulation that's education
[1:47:20] not stimulation education is dark and
[1:47:23] dreary words and formulas and ideas and
[1:47:26] hypotheses and
[1:47:28] you know
[1:47:29] psychiatrists or psychology trying to
[1:47:32] fix a spiritual problem
[1:47:34] revelation is quickening power
[1:47:38] amen and you want revival you got to
[1:47:40] open your heart to it
[1:47:43] you sit around and see somebody else
[1:47:45] being blessed and you don't open up
[1:47:48] you're not going to be blessed you want
[1:47:50] salvation you got to open the door to it
[1:47:53] amen but you see i want you to know
[1:47:56] heaven is not an eternal church service
[1:47:59] where we just sing and sing and sing and
[1:48:02] sing and say
[1:48:05] sing
[1:48:06] and absent-mindedly shout praises to god
[1:48:10] that's not heaven
[1:48:13] now that may be the job of some
[1:48:15] cherubims but that's not our job
[1:48:19] heaven is a place of wonderment
[1:48:21] a place of joy
[1:48:23] a place of peace and love and it has
[1:48:26] hills and mountains and valleys and
[1:48:29] rivers and crystal streams and open
[1:48:32] fields and wooded veils
[1:48:34] that's heaven
[1:48:37] when brother branham saw the pristine
[1:48:39] mountains of canada he told brother
[1:48:41] biscuit that heaven looks a whole lot
[1:48:42] like that
[1:48:44] with rolling hills and lofty mountains
[1:48:46] with beautiful fields like bluegrass
[1:48:49] with indescribable colors
[1:48:52] more vivid than anything you could ever
[1:48:54] imagine
[1:48:57] it's a land that is full of animals and
[1:49:00] wildlife except they're not wild there
[1:49:04] where nothing will hurt or destroy
[1:49:07] in all this holy mountain
[1:49:10] for there the lion will lay down by the
[1:49:12] lamb and the wolf will be tame and the
[1:49:15] bear will be cuddly and gentle
[1:49:19] it's a place where things that you love
[1:49:22] will be there too
[1:49:26] you know it has houses
[1:49:28] it has lands
[1:49:30] it's a city
[1:49:32] do you ever think of that it's a city
[1:49:35] it says also it's a country
[1:49:38] it is it has real foundations
[1:49:42] it has streets
[1:49:44] trees
[1:49:46] real houses
[1:49:47] with real furniture
[1:49:49] to resemble things we enjoyed here upon
[1:49:52] the earth
[1:49:56] and i'm not just talking about the
[1:49:57] millennium either
[1:49:59] i'm talking about the present heaven
[1:50:02] that brother charlie just went to
[1:50:05] it's a home
[1:50:08] as brother branham went there you
[1:50:10] remember
[1:50:12] can i just
[1:50:13] take just a minute and do this
[1:50:15] just remember when
[1:50:17] he there after hope had died and he was
[1:50:19] grieving so hard that god had to take
[1:50:22] him let him see how things were
[1:50:25] so he
[1:50:26] so he could realize he was better off
[1:50:30] there than here
[1:50:33] and there he there he
[1:50:35] he
[1:50:37] thought he was walking down he said i
[1:50:39] went into a trance
[1:50:41] and he said i was walking down this road
[1:50:44] i was out west somewhere
[1:50:46] and he said i had a cowboy hat on
[1:50:48] western clothes
[1:50:50] and he said i was whistling a song
[1:50:53] and singing it the wheel of the wagon is
[1:50:55] broken
[1:50:57] the sign on the ranch is for sale the
[1:51:00] wheel of the wagon is broken
[1:51:02] it must be the end of the trail it's no
[1:51:04] cowboy ballad
[1:51:06] and it's about the end of life it ends
[1:51:09] up you know in the course i think it
[1:51:10] says goodbye old paint it's a cowboy
[1:51:13] saying this goodbyes
[1:51:15] brother branham's out west
[1:51:17] and he says
[1:51:19] you know he said as i walked down this
[1:51:21] path he said i saw over there an old
[1:51:24] broken
[1:51:25] prairie schooner
[1:51:27] said it represented my broken family it
[1:51:29] was laying on his side and and there the
[1:51:32] wheel was broken off of it
[1:51:35] and and he just uh just um
[1:51:38] later in the vision he would see himself
[1:51:40] going west and he said he as he as was
[1:51:44] in an old cupboard wagon he was clicking
[1:51:46] the reins as he did with his wife and
[1:51:49] family in this prairie schooner i
[1:51:51] clicked the reins like this and i was
[1:51:53] holding the steering wheel in my station
[1:51:55] wagon
[1:51:57] a modern-day prairie scooter
[1:52:00] a wagon
[1:52:02] and he said as i passed the wreck
[1:52:06] you know how brother branham died
[1:52:09] as i passed the wreck
[1:52:12] and i got just past that a little bit
[1:52:15] there was a young girl standing there
[1:52:18] and she said hello daddy
[1:52:22] he said hello miss and she said hello
[1:52:24] daddy and you said daddy
[1:52:28] i'm not your daddy why you're just as
[1:52:31] old as i am
[1:52:33] how could i be your daddy because you
[1:52:35] don't know where you're at
[1:52:37] well
[1:52:40] on earth i was your little sharon rose
[1:52:42] but you know daddy the way you preached
[1:52:44] immortality which he wasn't preaching
[1:52:46] that then because this is fast forward
[1:52:48] in his life
[1:52:50] he said the way you preach more
[1:52:51] immortality
[1:52:53] there's no babies here
[1:52:55] we're all one age
[1:52:58] and then he says
[1:53:00] he says well
[1:53:03] sherry you really grew up and to be a
[1:53:04] beautiful girl
[1:53:06] and standing there looking at her blond
[1:53:08] hair and blue eyes and seeing her such a
[1:53:11] beautiful young ladies and he's trying
[1:53:13] to catch the reality of this because
[1:53:15] he's vincent as a mortal
[1:53:17] and he walks he says well then where's
[1:53:20] your mother
[1:53:21] because he knew he'd recognize her
[1:53:24] so he
[1:53:25] she said he's up there in your home
[1:53:28] waiting for you up there
[1:53:31] a home he said where branham's
[1:53:34] i've never had a home in my life you got
[1:53:36] to remember he rented his little place
[1:53:38] had outdoor toilets no running water
[1:53:42] they were poor impoverishes we've never
[1:53:44] had a homestead with daddy you got one
[1:53:46] here
[1:53:48] and mama's just waiting up there
[1:53:51] and said i saw a great light and i
[1:53:53] started walking toward that light and as
[1:53:55] i did hope came running out to meet me
[1:53:58] said she was emaciated and
[1:54:01] so sick when she died
[1:54:03] with that horrible diseases that she had
[1:54:07] of meningitis
[1:54:08] and tubercular
[1:54:10] and and there in her condition she was
[1:54:12] so
[1:54:13] bony and
[1:54:14] and and sick and drawn and there she was
[1:54:17] beautiful and young and
[1:54:20] and vibrant with health
[1:54:24] and i want you to think of this
[1:54:26] she
[1:54:27] she
[1:54:28] welcomed him home said come on in billy
[1:54:31] you've come home
[1:54:34] said you must be tired and weary
[1:54:36] after praying for all those sick people
[1:54:39] and brother branham's trying to
[1:54:41] understand all this he said well i
[1:54:43] wasn't even praying for the sick then
[1:54:45] and he says you know that's why i
[1:54:47] believe that one day i'll die right here
[1:54:49] in this pulpit he said i come close to
[1:54:50] dying like that the other day
[1:54:52] right here in the pulpit
[1:54:55] but he says
[1:54:56] so he says he walked in and he looked
[1:54:59] over there and he saw a chair
[1:55:02] that resembled the morris chair
[1:55:06] that he had bought their own time and
[1:55:08] couldn't pay for it and they come and
[1:55:10] got it a little stuffed chair that he
[1:55:12] could sit down and rest and read his
[1:55:14] bible prepare for sermons
[1:55:17] and i looked over there and i saw the
[1:55:19] morris chair and said she said to me
[1:55:23] i know what you're thinking
[1:55:25] but this will never be taken away
[1:55:31] are you with me
[1:55:33] you see it was a home it was a place it
[1:55:35] had familiar things it was real it was
[1:55:39] tangible
[1:55:40] it could be touched
[1:55:42] and man it was it was something it was
[1:55:45] something that uh the the senses could
[1:55:48] declare
[1:55:49] now so you see
[1:55:51] we're going to come we will live up on a
[1:55:53] resurrected earth in a resurrected
[1:55:56] universe inhabited by resurrected people
[1:56:00] with a resurrected jesus
[1:56:03] amen so that's why i scream out today
[1:56:05] choose life
[1:56:08] don't choose death choose life
[1:56:11] and the death i'm talking about is being
[1:56:13] separated forever from god and spinning
[1:56:17] it forever in hell
[1:56:21] for just as heaven is a real place
[1:56:24] hell is not offensive
[1:56:26] eviction it's real also
[1:56:29] and brother brandon said i went there
[1:56:31] too
[1:56:33] and he said
[1:56:35] to get there i was sinking
[1:56:38] in an endless eternity
[1:56:41] many of you heard me tell me sinking
[1:56:43] into an endless eternity i was going
[1:56:45] down through the clouds and through
[1:56:47] darkness and sinking on down and i'm
[1:56:50] getting to the regions of the lost and i
[1:56:52] screamed there was no foundation to it
[1:56:55] i could never stop falling for eternity
[1:56:59] it looked like i was going to fall there
[1:57:00] was no stopping nowhere
[1:57:04] let me tell you something that's exactly
[1:57:06] what happens to people
[1:57:08] when they turn their back on the message
[1:57:13] they start a downward fall
[1:57:16] oh i would never drink or i would never
[1:57:18] do this and i would never live that way
[1:57:20] and i would never
[1:57:22] and they keep falling
[1:57:24] they step off the truth and just keep
[1:57:27] falling and falling and falling and
[1:57:30] first thing you know every kind of sin
[1:57:33] and evil and awful wicked things begin
[1:57:37] to attach to them
[1:57:39] they begin to cut themselves and mark
[1:57:41] themselves with tattoos and everything
[1:57:45] else to identify with a culture of hell
[1:57:52] first thing you know they they get down
[1:57:54] or first they first the thing you know
[1:57:56] they don't believe the message the next
[1:57:58] thing they they do they they discredit
[1:58:01] the prophet the next thing they
[1:58:02] discredit the one who's sinning
[1:58:05] jesus christ
[1:58:07] amen then the next thing you know they
[1:58:09] don't believe the bible no more and then
[1:58:11] the next thing you know they don't even
[1:58:12] believe there's a god
[1:58:14] you see it has no foundation they just
[1:58:16] keep falling and falling and falling and
[1:58:19] falling
[1:58:21] and brother branham said i was falling
[1:58:23] and he was crying out and screaming
[1:58:26] somebody catch me
[1:58:28] mama catch me and said there was no
[1:58:29] mother there
[1:58:31] said i screamed you know to to to to um
[1:58:35] to my daddy catch me somebody anyway
[1:58:38] there was no daddy there
[1:58:40] and he said i i was screamed out to god
[1:58:44] and there was no god there
[1:58:46] and after a while i began to hear the
[1:58:48] most mournful sounds i'd ever heard an
[1:58:51] awful feelings
[1:58:52] and said a literal burning hell would be
[1:58:55] a pleasure to decide of what this was
[1:58:58] and so it was just one of the most
[1:59:00] harmless feelings
[1:59:02] and he said i saw them there their
[1:59:05] painted faces looked like cats and like
[1:59:08] the women paint their eyes today and the
[1:59:10] green junk under their eyes and and hood
[1:59:12] they were going oh oh they were insane
[1:59:16] and he said creamed out like god have
[1:59:18] mercy upon me you know oh god if you
[1:59:21] only let me go back and live
[1:59:23] i promise to be a good boy
[1:59:25] that's the only thing i could say and he
[1:59:27] said you know lord i promise i'll be a
[1:59:29] good boy he said i told lies i've done
[1:59:32] all kinds of things that can be done but
[1:59:34] i i
[1:59:35] had been blowed almost halfway in true
[1:59:37] with the with the um with the shotgun
[1:59:40] blast and as a as a friend you know shot
[1:59:43] him there and he and he says
[1:59:46] but only thing i could say to god is
[1:59:49] i'll be a good boy you know i never
[1:59:50] committed adultery god and you know i
[1:59:53] but if you let me go back he said i
[1:59:55] never accepted his pardon
[1:59:59] now remember that's important
[2:00:02] to accept his pardon
[2:00:04] to think about that you can be the
[2:00:06] wretched most worst indebted sinner in
[2:00:10] the world but he offers a pardon
[2:00:13] he is able to pay your debt
[2:00:16] in fall
[2:00:20] and he said i was just a new arrival
[2:00:22] there in the most hideous horrible
[2:00:24] ungodly feeling that you could have and
[2:00:28] and
[2:00:28] it was a sinking and sinking
[2:00:32] you know i i tell you i've i've i've
[2:00:35] read a lot of near-death experiences in
[2:00:38] our day that we're living in there are
[2:00:41] doctors now that have even written books
[2:00:44] cardiologists
[2:00:46] um that have written upon near-death
[2:00:48] experiences because in our modern day
[2:00:51] we've been able to bring people back to
[2:00:53] life after death
[2:00:55] you know within so many sometimes
[2:00:58] sometimes
[2:00:59] miraculously it can be an hour or so
[2:01:01] after they've been declared dead but
[2:01:02] they come back
[2:01:04] sometimes only minutes but in that brief
[2:01:06] moments there they experience things
[2:01:09] and i'll just tell you you know there
[2:01:10] was a there was a brother there was a
[2:01:13] brother in south africa
[2:01:15] who who actually had an operation of
[2:01:18] surgery and he said he gave a testimony
[2:01:21] i listened to his testimony where that
[2:01:24] where that when he died
[2:01:26] there after the operation he couldn't
[2:01:28] breathe and he died he said i raised up
[2:01:31] out of my body
[2:01:33] i was just alive as ever and i was
[2:01:36] looking back at my body and then working
[2:01:39] over trying to resuscitate me
[2:01:42] and he said i i watched them called the
[2:01:44] doctor and i watched them the doctor
[2:01:46] come running down the the hall and i
[2:01:49] watched him wheel me down to the
[2:01:52] operating room he said i was in complete
[2:01:54] control i wasn't i wasn't hurting i
[2:01:57] wasn't sick i had good feelings
[2:01:59] everything else i had i had he had
[2:02:02] tremendous eyesight all my senses was
[2:02:04] there
[2:02:05] this is a believer
[2:02:08] but there was a man by the name of
[2:02:09] howard storm that i read about that he
[2:02:12] was an art professor and was an atheist
[2:02:15] big college professor was over at france
[2:02:18] he had a condition in his stomach and
[2:02:21] within five hours he was to have to have
[2:02:23] an operation because he couldn't live
[2:02:24] longer than that and they neglected him
[2:02:27] to let him they let him die
[2:02:30] and he said in that moment after i died
[2:02:33] he said i told my wife goodbye and she
[2:02:36] was sweeping and all of that and and i
[2:02:39] told her goodbye and he said i just
[2:02:41] wanted to get some relief and i was
[2:02:43] scared of dying because that was the end
[2:02:45] i didn't believe there was any god
[2:02:47] whatsoever
[2:02:49] and i just knew and i was terrified that
[2:02:51] it would just be
[2:02:53] him that's it
[2:02:55] but the next moment
[2:02:57] i raised up out of my body and i look
[2:03:00] down at my body and i'm
[2:03:02] i'm i see my body there but i'm just as
[2:03:05] well as ever i feel fine

[2:03:10] hurting and i look down there and see
[2:03:12] there i see my i see my wife over there
[2:03:14] and she got her hands uh her head and
[2:03:18] her hands and she's crying and i i try
[2:03:20] to say something to her and she don't

[2:03:36] see me and so there's a patient in the
[2:03:38] next bed and he'd been nice to us and i

[2:03:50] i'm not dead
[2:03:54] they didn't know where i they never knew
[2:03:56] it
[2:03:59] and he said i still stepped out i was at
[2:04:01] the doorway and i heard voices calling
[2:04:03] me howard howard
[2:04:06] and i went out and i thought they were
[2:04:08] coming to take me to a surgery i need a
[2:04:10] doctor he said
[2:04:12] and he said they started taking me
[2:04:14] down a long dark corridor
[2:04:18] and it got darker and darker and darker
[2:04:22] as we went down down down
[2:04:26] and that you know we had went miles and
[2:04:28] miles and miles and miles seemed like
[2:04:31] and he says i i i was saying where are
[2:04:34] you taking me to
[2:04:36] and and you know i i needed a doctor and
[2:04:39] i need help and and and they began to
[2:04:42] laugh at him and use profanity and they
[2:04:45] began to mock him and and they and and
[2:04:49] they they're going down together and and
[2:04:51] then they began to kick him and beat him
[2:04:54] and slap him and you know he said i was
[2:04:57] a had been a football player and i i i
[2:05:00] knew i knew how to defend myself so i
[2:05:02] was jabbing back and i was kicking and i
[2:05:05] was slapping and i was trying to defend
[2:05:07] myself but there were there were
[2:05:09] hundreds of them tormented spirits
[2:05:13] that began pulling at me
[2:05:15] he said they they they began to tear me
[2:05:18] to pieces where they gouged out my eyes
[2:05:22] and pulled off my ears and they took
[2:05:25] pieces i can't even describe all the
[2:05:28] things it was so horrible he said i had
[2:05:30] never been able to tell anybody the
[2:05:33] horrible things that they did to me
[2:05:35] and i was collapsed there finally laid
[2:05:38] on the floor collapsed
[2:05:41] a piece
[2:05:43] he said just a piece like in a septic
[2:05:46] tank like my life was
[2:05:50] just a piece of garbage
[2:05:55] and he said
[2:05:56] something didn't begin
[2:05:58] to say within me
[2:05:59] pray
[2:06:01] and he said i don't know how to pray
[2:06:03] i don't pray i don't believe in god
[2:06:06] and he said come from my chest and said
[2:06:08] pray
[2:06:10] and he said i don't know even how to
[2:06:12] pray i don't know what to pray and say
[2:06:14] pray anyway and he began to pray you
[2:06:18] know he began to
[2:06:20] begin to try to remember some prayers
[2:06:22] from when he was a little boy in sunday
[2:06:24] school that he'd been taught you know
[2:06:26] and began to you know to to to say you
[2:06:30] know things like our father or god or
[2:06:33] you know our father
[2:06:35] uh you know our country trinity sweet
[2:06:38] land of liberty
[2:06:39] god you know the the mountains blew and
[2:06:42] he's trying to say anything you know he
[2:06:44] could remember that had god in it
[2:06:47] and as he would begin to speak of god he
[2:06:49] noticed that that as he called out on
[2:06:52] the names of god and spoke of him he saw
[2:06:55] them demons move back from him
[2:06:58] and he said they they began to scream
[2:07:00] even more and whatever but they began to
[2:07:02] draw back as he began to call on god
[2:07:05] and and there and i just i just took
[2:07:08] from that sometimes you don't realize
[2:07:10] the power of a believer's prayer
[2:07:13] [Music]
[2:07:15] for he said in my name i'll cast out
[2:07:17] devils
[2:07:19] in my name you'll cast out devils are
[2:07:21] you with me that the effectual fervent
[2:07:24] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[2:07:29] and as he began to just remember just
[2:07:32] little fragments of prayers and little
[2:07:35] things about god you know and finally
[2:07:38] you know they left him alone and he said
[2:07:40] there i was and he thought here i am i'm
[2:07:42] going to spend an endless eternity in
[2:07:45] this mess and i'm at
[2:07:47] a collapsed broken piece here
[2:07:52] and he said
[2:07:53] all of a sudden it welled up within me
[2:07:56] jesus
[2:07:59] jesus loves me
[2:08:01] and he said i i didn't believe in jesus
[2:08:03] but all of a sudden i wanted him to love
[2:08:06] me more than ever i wanted to be loved
[2:08:10] and i said jesus
[2:08:12] jesus have mercy on me and he said when
[2:08:15] i called on his name i saw a light
[2:08:18] it was a little light and as it come it
[2:08:20] got greater and greater and he he come
[2:08:23] down and he picked me up in his arms and
[2:08:25] he loved me like a mother with his child
[2:08:28] and i sobbed and i wept up on his
[2:08:30] shoulders
[2:08:31] and he said he began to take me from
[2:08:34] that place
[2:08:35] into the light and we began to pass
[2:08:38] through this like the speed of light and
[2:08:40] he said we were traveling fast because i
[2:08:42] could see light and and places and
[2:08:45] things that were just going back like
[2:08:47] blimps and all of a sudden i saw the
[2:08:49] most beautiful city
[2:08:51] let me tell you friends
[2:08:54] that was a man who was an atheist
[2:08:57] this man
[2:08:58] would then become a preacher in a
[2:09:00] secular denomination because that's what
[2:09:02] he knew
[2:09:04] but he became a christian he gave up his
[2:09:06] lifestyle the way that he lived he was
[2:09:08] changed
[2:09:09] from that moment
[2:09:13] let me tell you
[2:09:16] let me tell you if we understood even
[2:09:18] the slightest bit
[2:09:21] there was none of us would ever say go
[2:09:23] to hell
[2:09:26] it's far too easy to go to hell
[2:09:29] it requires no change of course
[2:09:33] you know we
[2:09:34] listen we were
[2:09:36] we were born with an autopilot set on
[2:09:39] hell
[2:09:41] and it's nothing to take lightly
[2:09:44] hell is the single greatest tragedy in
[2:09:47] the universe
[2:09:49] and god loves us enough to tell us in
[2:09:51] the bible the truth that there are two
[2:09:54] destinations not just one and we must
[2:09:57] choose the right path if we're going to
[2:10:00] go to heaven all roads don't lead to
[2:10:03] heaven
[2:10:04] only one does and that's jesus christ
[2:10:07] for he said no man can come to the
[2:10:09] father except by me
[2:10:12] all other roads lead to hell
[2:10:18] let me just tell you god and satan are
[2:10:21] not equal opposites
[2:10:23] neither are heaven and hell equal
[2:10:25] opposites
[2:10:26] god has no equal as a person and heaven
[2:10:29] has no equal as a place
[2:10:32] hell is not going to be a wonderful
[2:10:34] place
[2:10:35] it's going to be amazingly dull
[2:10:38] close and insignificant without company
[2:10:41] without help without god without purpose
[2:10:44] without accomplishment it won't have its
[2:10:48] it won't have its own story
[2:10:50] you won't be laughing and drinking beer
[2:10:54] and sipping wine and listening to rock
[2:10:56] music
[2:10:58] there will be no bands playing rap and
[2:11:01] rock and roll or country
[2:11:03] elvis won't be there to serenade you
[2:11:06] he'll be too wrapped up in his own awful
[2:11:08] decision of selling his birthright for
[2:11:11] popularity
[2:11:12] to comfort you
[2:11:15] yeah
[2:11:16] amen there won't be anyone to
[2:11:17] commiserate with you and to comfort you
[2:11:21] everybody will be alone in their own
[2:11:23] grief knowing they rejected life
[2:11:30] and hell is worse
[2:11:32] than the terriblest nightmare
[2:11:35] because you never wake up
[2:11:42] but i want you to consider this
[2:11:45] god determined
[2:11:47] that he would rather go to hell on our
[2:11:49] behalf
[2:11:50] than to live in heaven without you
[2:11:55] [Applause]
[2:11:56] i think that went over your head
[2:11:59] amen i want you to consider the
[2:12:01] wonderment of this
[2:12:02] god determined he would rather go to
[2:12:05] hell
[2:12:06] on our behalf than to live in heaven
[2:12:09] without you
[2:12:12] he wants oh hallelujah
[2:12:15] he wants so much
[2:12:17] for you not to go to hell he paid a
[2:12:20] horrible price
[2:12:22] on the cross that you wouldn't have to
[2:12:24] go to hell
[2:12:26] he left all of heaven
[2:12:28] the throne it's beauty it's tranquility
[2:12:31] it's peace it's wonder man it's
[2:12:33] beautiful vivid colors it's wonderful
[2:12:35] mountains it's eden he left it all to
[2:12:38] come to earth
[2:12:42] not only to redeem man but to redeem the
[2:12:44] earth
[2:12:46] and being that your body is the first of
[2:12:48] the earth he took cursed earth i want
[2:12:51] you to get this
[2:12:52] the earth had been cursed
[2:12:55] in eden
[2:12:56] because of sin
[2:12:58] is that right
[2:12:59] amen and the earth had been cursed and
[2:13:02] god took on cursed earth
[2:13:04] and came and wrapped himself in cursed
[2:13:07] earth
[2:13:08] amen oh yeah it started from a spoken
[2:13:11] word it started from from a seed but
[2:13:14] then he took that life and began to wrap
[2:13:16] little sails around it from his mother
[2:13:19] and and and things like that we talk
[2:13:22] about mary his mother but mary was an
[2:13:24] incubator
[2:13:26] amen and and he built around that
[2:13:30] seed of life
[2:13:32] from the spoken word
[2:13:34] and wrapped dust around it
[2:13:37] what kind of dust cursed earth
[2:13:41] amen one that could die on a cross
[2:13:45] one that can be tempted by sin
[2:13:47] one that could are you with me that
[2:13:49] could endure every kind of temptation
[2:13:52] known to man so he could be a faithful
[2:13:55] high priest
[2:13:57] that he can say i know what you're going
[2:13:59] through i know what your trouble is i've
[2:14:02] been there

[2:14:28] pain until i die with that
[2:14:36] i know what it is to go to hell
[2:14:38] and be torn to pieces
[2:14:40] like the scapegoat that would find its
[2:14:42] way in the wilderness
[2:14:44] left alone i know what it is to be left
[2:14:47] alone and without god
[2:14:51] i know what it is
[2:14:53] to be torn to pardon torn to pieces
[2:14:57] that the bible typed him as a scapegoat
[2:15:00] and in israel they would take the sins
[2:15:02] of the people and they would place it
[2:15:04] upon the goat and then they would lay
[2:15:07] take this little kid this little little
[2:15:11] baby goat and take it out into the
[2:15:14] wilderness and leave it by itself
[2:15:18] slip away from it
[2:15:20] one would one of the priests would take
[2:15:22] it out into the wilderness

[2:17:09] [Applause]
[2:17:13] so that you could enjoy paradise
[2:17:16] with him
[2:17:18] he took your place
[2:17:21] as brother branham would say he took
[2:17:22] that cursed earth down to the jordan
[2:17:24] river made it obey the word and baptized
[2:17:28] it in water
[2:17:30] rose up and got filled with the holy
[2:17:32] ghost
[2:17:33] the first of a new creation
[2:17:36] so that there could be others that would
[2:17:38] be of the same resurrection he was a
[2:17:40] part of
[2:17:42] so there's a real people
[2:17:44] who will be in this real heaven
[2:17:47] with the real jesus
[2:17:52] oh well brother tim heaven is i just
[2:17:54] imagine it's just it's just a place of
[2:17:56] spirits you know
[2:17:58] um
[2:17:59] where people are just disembodied
[2:18:01] spirits yeah brother branham thought
[2:18:03] that once
[2:18:05] he thought you know their bodies can't
[2:18:07] be
[2:18:08] felt her touch but he went there
[2:18:11] he found out i can touch them
[2:18:14] they're real people
[2:18:17] and
[2:18:18] and their bodies can be felt and touch
[2:18:20] well brother tim i i don't know i think
[2:18:23] they're just spirits i mean how can
[2:18:25] people in in in real bodies like you're
[2:18:28] talking about being a real place and
[2:18:30] real mountains and we can't see it and
[2:18:32] we're not a part of it and it's up there
[2:18:34] somewhere you know just one breath away
[2:18:38] how can it be brother tim well let me
[2:18:40] tell you by the bible i know of one man
[2:18:43] in particular that's there
[2:18:45] he was raised from the dead amen the man
[2:18:48] jesus christ
[2:18:50] ascended into heaven
[2:18:52] a man
[2:18:53] in a in a physical body with a physical
[2:18:56] resurrection and is there as a physical
[2:18:58] person
[2:19:00] in a physical place
[2:19:02] he's not a spirit floating around and
[2:19:04] neither will you be
[2:19:07] you'll be in a body
[2:19:09] when stephen was departing he saw him
[2:19:12] there said i see jesus
[2:19:14] he didn't see a spirit he saw the man
[2:19:17] i see jesus standing at the father's
[2:19:20] right hand
[2:19:21] you know i i see him as the only visible
[2:19:25] manifestation of the almighty god who
[2:19:28] became tangible
[2:19:30] so there'll be real people
[2:19:32] who will be in this real heaven
[2:19:34] with jesus
[2:19:36] a real jesus
[2:19:38] a bride who'll be united with her groom
[2:19:41] strolling together
[2:19:43] with all the other saints
[2:19:46] amen of the is sharing their story
[2:19:49] hallelujah heaven won't be alone
[2:19:54] hallelujah
[2:19:56] amen but you'll be sharing your story
[2:19:58] with others
[2:19:59] how god loves you yes how special
[2:20:03] he was to you
[2:20:05] i mean sharing the memories of life
[2:20:07] together
[2:20:09] hallelujah
[2:20:10] and there is a real hell
[2:20:13] the torment of your missed opportunities
[2:20:17] will be worse than the torments of any
[2:20:20] flame you might can imagine
[2:20:24] and just as heaven is a real place hell
[2:20:27] is no fiction
[2:20:29] it's a real place
[2:20:30] i hope you never find out how real it is
[2:20:34] i hope you find out the reality of
[2:20:36] heaven
[2:20:37] but i'm telling you it depends on the
[2:20:39] choice you make
[2:20:42] that moment in his presence where you
[2:20:44] receive his life
[2:20:47] because
[2:20:48] you cannot live this sinful life there
[2:20:55] now
[2:20:59] as a sinner
[2:21:01] you have no foundation nothing to really
[2:21:03] stabilize you
[2:21:05] you say well i'll be this
[2:21:07] i'll be that i have resolved
[2:21:10] and it crumbles beneath you
[2:21:12] it's like brother branham saw his son
[2:21:14] billy paul
[2:21:16] he'd taken a shot of penicillin and was
[2:21:19] admitted to the hospital was on the
[2:21:20] verge of death
[2:21:22] dying
[2:21:24] and brother branham was away and
[2:21:27] this angel of god comes to him and says
[2:21:30] go get to billy
[2:21:31] because said what about billy what's
[2:21:33] going on
[2:21:34] he said billy is in the hospital he's
[2:21:36] dying he's on the verge of the death he
[2:21:38] goes to the hospital and the
[2:21:40] doctor says billy i didn't know he was
[2:21:43] allergic to penicillin and he's dying
[2:21:46] i've killed your boy billy
[2:21:48] and brother branham saw his boy in that
[2:21:50] condition
[2:21:51] a prophet's son
[2:21:56] you may be a
[2:21:58] preacher's daughter
[2:22:00] a deacon's daughter deacon's son
[2:22:02] preacher's daughter a preacher's
[2:22:04] granddaughter but let me tell you
[2:22:06] without christ
[2:22:08] you're tumbling down
[2:22:10] down down and sin will always take you
[2:22:14] farther than what you want to go
[2:22:20] so i i don't even want to hear about
[2:22:22] this brother to him i want to hear about
[2:22:24] heaven well let me tell you
[2:22:26] just as heaven is real
[2:22:28] hell is real also
[2:22:31] and we're not in this life to play games
[2:22:36] this earth is an intermediate place and
[2:22:39] only here can you make decisions
[2:22:42] there it'll be too late
[2:22:46] there may be cases like howard storm
[2:22:48] that that have a near-death experience
[2:22:51] but remember it was only near death
[2:22:55] and god allowed him to see where he was
[2:22:58] going
[2:22:59] and allowed him to see there was a way
[2:23:01] of
[2:23:02] escape you say i wish god would do that
[2:23:05] for me he's doing it for you this
[2:23:07] morning
[2:23:08] he does it with every gospel preacher
[2:23:11] amen for even from the verses you
[2:23:13] learned on your mother's knee he's been
[2:23:16] doing it trying to let you know god so
[2:23:18] loves you
[2:23:19] he don't want you to go there
[2:23:26] this is only the place you can make
[2:23:28] decisions
[2:23:29] there will be too late
[2:23:31] and one breath away your decisions are
[2:23:35] sealed forever
[2:23:39] too late
[2:23:41] to make a change
[2:23:44] but brother branham envisioned heaven
[2:23:48] after being there he began to talk about
[2:23:51] it in the message adoption it was right
[2:23:53] after that experience
[2:23:56] and he said
[2:23:57] i think of heaven now like this
[2:24:01] we put on this glorious body
[2:24:04] this celestial body has been made
[2:24:05] glorified and this must be in the new
[2:24:08] heavens and the new earth and he said i
[2:24:10] i can go walk over and say brother
[2:24:13] neville
[2:24:15] i you know or to one of the other
[2:24:17] brothers let's cook the papa god this
[2:24:19] morning
[2:24:20] he's god we know him now he's a savior
[2:24:22] he's a healer
[2:24:24] and he says
[2:24:26] and he said i walked up he said you know
[2:24:28] brother humes
[2:24:30] and and you unless from you and i and
[2:24:32] brother beeler some of the brothers
[2:24:34] brother neville we'll we'll go up to
[2:24:36] papa god and say we're going to take a
[2:24:38] little journey
[2:24:40] said you boys you like the mountains
[2:24:42] when you were mortal oh yeah we did
[2:24:45] well there's a couple of million miles
[2:24:47] of them out yonder and that new world
[2:24:49] just go ahead and roam over them
[2:24:53] and so it's out there roaming on the
[2:24:55] mountains
[2:24:56] god is that present
[2:24:58] because he said while they are yet
[2:25:00] speaking i'll hear
[2:25:03] that's isaiah 66
[2:25:06] you see there's no distance you can walk
[2:25:08] slowly or you and enjoy all the sights
[2:25:12] along the way
[2:25:13] and stroll over this heaven or you can
[2:25:16] travel like a thought
[2:25:22] and so he said you know we walking along
[2:25:25] we've been walking along as brothers now
[2:25:27] 500 years or so maybe just a little
[2:25:30] journey maybe a million
[2:25:33] don't make any difference he said now
[2:25:34] that sounds crazy
[2:25:36] but it's the truth there's no time
[2:25:39] it's all eternity
[2:25:41] and as we're walking along we
[2:25:44] we
[2:25:45] meet somebody out there and we see it's
[2:25:46] sister georgie bruce
[2:25:49] and say well sister george had been a
[2:25:51] long time since i've seen you
[2:25:53] but she looks just like she did always
[2:25:57] she's timeless
[2:25:58] she might maybe it's 10 million years
[2:26:00] old but just as young as she ever was
[2:26:05] and she'd be scratching somebody on the
[2:26:07] back and i'd look there and there's
[2:26:08] sheet of the line and i said how are you
[2:26:11] this morning sheeta
[2:26:13] my meow's like a kitten
[2:26:16] sister bruce says well i've been down
[2:26:17] there talking to some those sisters down
[2:26:20] there around them big flowers down there
[2:26:21] we've been down there probably 500 years
[2:26:24] looking around
[2:26:27] now that's the way he's envisioned in
[2:26:28] heaven
[2:26:30] so what bless your heart sister georgie
[2:26:32] no harm can come nothing knowledge and
[2:26:34] in the evening time we'll go on top of
[2:26:36] the mountain and we'll say oh papa god
[2:26:40] i once was lost
[2:26:42] i was once in the month of sin papa god
[2:26:45] and you saved me
[2:26:48] hallelujah amen you said you talk about
[2:26:51] worship the angels don't even know how
[2:26:53] to worship like that i was lost
[2:26:56] and you left all of heaven for me he
[2:26:58] never did that for one angel but he did
[2:27:00] it for you
[2:27:02] god so loved you
[2:27:05] he left all of heaven
[2:27:08] so you wouldn't have to go to hell
[2:27:11] and he went and took on hell so you
[2:27:14] wouldn't have to go there
[2:27:16] amen what a mighty god this is
[2:27:19] brother brandon said you ever think of
[2:27:20] hell he said it's like the old colgate
[2:27:22] dump

[2:27:33] can be and rats running all over you and
[2:27:37] trying to eat on you he said and that's

[2:28:19] fought and he fought and thought he'd
[2:28:21] get healed and get better and get healed
[2:28:22] and get better and then and finally he
[2:28:24] gets to a place
[2:28:26] his body can't sustain life any longer
[2:28:30] and god's got a better healing for him
[2:28:33] just one breath
[2:28:36] into a new body
[2:28:38] where none of these rats come
[2:28:41] where they're out of the reach of devils
[2:28:44] old age
[2:28:46] infirmities
[2:28:48] all perfection you see god took a
[2:28:50] picture of you before the foundation of

[2:28:56] he took a picture of you at your best
[2:29:00] hey that wasn't here in this life
[2:29:02] because the best of his life is a
[2:29:04] colgate dump
[2:29:06] amen we're all falling apart
[2:29:09] i read brother adam saying the other day
[2:29:11] he said if you're past 25 you're dying

[2:31:04] cancers pull at your body
[2:31:07] till it can't hold life any longer
[2:31:10] you get real old and you can't help
[2:31:11] yourself
[2:31:14] i marvel i watch strong men
[2:31:17] with such athletes
[2:31:20] be pulled down to the dust
[2:31:23] feeble
[2:31:25] need somebody to help them across the
[2:31:27] room
[2:31:30] tottering in their steps
[2:31:32] and you think about that
[2:31:36] in that condition
[2:31:38] and somebody reached down and turned you
[2:31:40] back to an 18 year old boy and set you
[2:31:42] on top of the mountain a bloom of health
[2:31:46] and and with a good breath of fresh air
[2:31:48] and a good cold drink of water
[2:31:50] would you ever want to go back to that
[2:31:52] dump

[2:31:59] we're living in
[2:32:04] he don't want no part of this stinky
[2:32:07] dirty rat infested horrible place
[2:32:11] [Music]
[2:32:16] one breath
[2:32:20] all of that

[2:32:24] young
[2:32:26] beautiful
[2:32:28] he got ushered to the other side
[2:32:31] the bible said angels come and carry
[2:32:34] them there
[2:32:41] i go to prepare a place
[2:32:44] for you
[2:32:46] and it's almost finished
[2:32:49] i'm telling you it's almost finished
[2:32:53] the last one
[2:32:55] to go there
[2:32:58] before they come back here
[2:33:02] is just about made it
[2:33:04] over you hear what i'm saying
[2:33:07] the last one can you imagine can you
[2:33:10] imagine that last one i think about the
[2:33:12] man on the cross
[2:33:15] who went and asked jesus for for pardon
[2:33:17] and he said this day you'll be with me
[2:33:19] in paradise
[2:33:22] right
[2:33:23] amen and there he recognized who he was
[2:33:25] the son of god
[2:33:27] and said have mercy on me when you come
[2:33:29] into your kingdom and he said this day
[2:33:31] i'll be with you in paradise amen and i
[2:33:35] can imagine now he is the last one of
[2:33:38] the old testament
[2:33:40] to enter into paradise before the
[2:33:43] messiah comes
[2:33:45] are you with me a thief an unworthy man
[2:33:48] but pardoned in the last moment
[2:33:51] that's why i say never give up
[2:33:54] because god is the god rich in mercy
[2:33:57] and the last one comes in the last one
[2:34:00] you say the last one of the old
[2:34:02] testament saints go there
[2:34:05] i can almost see him in my mind running
[2:34:09] down the corners screaming
[2:34:12] knocking on the doors and say brothers
[2:34:14] he's coming i just saw him on the cross
[2:34:18] paying for your sins and my sin and he's
[2:34:22] about to empty this place and take us
[2:34:24] into the presence of god
[2:34:27] hallelujah one day the last one will
[2:34:30] cross over and when they do they'll come
[2:34:33] right back up and appear to the saints
[2:34:36] and we which are alive and remain will
[2:34:38] be changed in a moment in a twinkling of
[2:34:41] an eye
[2:34:44] i go to prepare a place for you
[2:34:49] and i will come again and receive you to
[2:34:52] myself that where i am there you may be
[2:34:55] also
[2:34:58] because
[2:34:59] heaven won't be heaven to me
[2:35:01] unless you're there
[2:35:07] let the musicians come
[2:35:09] this is the last warning there will
[2:35:12] never be another brother branham says

[2:35:35] watched breathlessly as for she glistens
[2:35:38] and shines with the glory that is
[2:35:40] unearthly

[2:35:44] story of amazing grace and jesus love
[2:35:47] she's a city
[2:35:48] prepared for prepared people
[2:35:51] she awaits only
[2:35:53] her inhabitants
[2:35:55] and soon
[2:35:56] they will throng
[2:35:58] her streets with joy
[2:36:00] it is the last call
[2:36:02] the spirit will not speak in another age
[2:36:06] the ages
[2:36:07] are over amelia
[2:36:10] would you bow your head for a moment
[2:36:13] if this is the last message from jesus
[2:36:16] himself to the laodicean messenger

[2:36:22] your heart there nothing else come in
[2:36:24] that will
[2:36:25] if this message don't turn your heart
