just a moment if you don't mind as we say a whole when we have one service on the weekend let's make it a good service oh yeah amen so we're just happy to be here tonight and we thank God for the opportunity thing with Iran for inviting us we have been buddies a long long time I had hair hehas was red man and you know we've had some good times together been through some situations but God has kept us and brought us through it and we're just so so grateful for that amen we've kind of grown up together and the things of the Lord and ministry and we certainly do appreciate God's goodness to both of us yeah amen just I'd like to give just a little bit of report if it's okay from our our camp meeting and since our camp meeting we have been here with you over Labor Day and we certainly enjoyed the meetings here just tremendous time and the presence of the Lord and the Word of God was just absolutely rich rich rich and I know you're still ruminating on that and man if you're not you need to yeah man because I tell you the services were just tremendous but back to camp meeting this year we had brother Ron speak of course and brother Tom ray and we certainly enjoyed the ministry there plus the Missionary brothers in the mornings and just some wonderful times and as you know we have the meetings and we collect funds for missionary work and whenever the brothers come from overseas they bring their requests and their needs and amounts that they need to help build churches put roofs on churches windows doors whatever the needs might be to buy motorbikes or transportation for the Brethren to get about and preach the gospel and this year we were presented with over 460 thousand dollars worth of liens yeah that's a lot of me what minute wait a minute let me finish we had that many requests brother Joey I need this much but the Joey I need this much but the joy I need this much but the Lord gave us two hundred nine thousand two hundred and fifty two dollars now and ever ever sin of that will go to foreign missions as we tell we don't even take the postage or the wire transfer fees or anything out of that we we take care of that as a local church and we just thank God for what he has done and there's gonna be many little churches that'll have a roof over their heads they'll have a building to worship the Lord in and I just like to tell this several years ago several trips back we were in the Philippines and we were in a certain place and it just happened to be my birthday in February and a little brother come up to me brother Vernon he said billy joel he said would you pray that the Lord will help me to be able to put some walls around my church he said all I have is a that's roof and some poles stuck how would you like to go to church there so he said you pray with me that the Lord will will help provide funds to put her walls on my church and I asked him through the interpreter I said brother how much would it take to footballs on your church and he calculated in his head and then the brother translated the amount and come out to be a hundred and twenty US dollars oh yeah so guess what I did I bought myself a birthday present put walls on that church amen so if they don't ask for a lot compared to other things but you know the Bible teaches us that little as much how I see and I believe that is brother Ron talk about my dad he taught me very well Amen that you the more you plant the more you reap and I'm not in it to reap this evening but I know it's whether Tim Freud preached here a few years ago God keeps a record amen and there is an accounting they coming a man and he's going to hand out rewards and I want to do everything I can to get all the rewards I can get so I can cast my crowns at the feet of the Lord Jesus amen so we thank God for His blessings and thank you all that we're able to be there and those that that couldn't be there and wanted to be there thank you as well because he had a heart to be there amen also I'd like for sister ex in the stand she'll deal with me later I have been accused of having another wife yeah and she is another girl compared to what she was a few months ago we thank god she's had a couple of surgeries this year and as brother ron has already said she's she's getting about better than she has and I have quite a few years and slimmer and trimmer and more beautiful as the day goes by and man and I thank God for my good wife this [Applause] [Music] and also before we go to the word just one more thing sister Tanya that's saying when she was born she was born with a cleft palate inside and the doctors had to go in and put that together repair that and it was a pretty major deal and you you would think she had a cleft palate and can sing like that it's just the hand of God amen dad was on an airplane we went somewhere sometime after she had the surgery and the repair was done and and sat down beside this distinguished-looking gentleman and began to make some conversation as you do sometimes on an airplane and come to find out this guy was a doctor and he was a doctor from Duke University and dad began to say well I had a granddaughter that had a surgery there and well what was her name and what kind of surgery he said well she had a cleft palate and the doctor there repaired that he said well what is her name and he told her I told the doctor and he said you know I'm the doctor that did that surgery and he sat down on a piece of paper and drew exactly what he did and what he how he repaired it and that give dad has a proud grandpa an opportunity to thank him personally for what he did for Tanya hey man so we thank God for the gifts in the body of Christ and amen now would you stand with me raise the Lord let's bow our heads our the word of Prayer precious heavenly father God how grateful and how thankful we are that we can look back on their lives Lord and we can see your great hand of mercy that's been extended your blessings Lord that you have bestowed upon us so abundantly and free and father tonight Lord we stand here in this sacred place and Lord you see this afternoon is I've tried to get the butterflies in sequence and in line and the nerves Lord but I pray father that you would just calm the nerves tonight Lord and you would just help me to step aside this evening because I realize Lord in myself I can say nothing or do nothing that will be of eternal benefit for these precious people of God but Lord if I could just get out of the way in you my vessel to you lourdes as a microphone and man and put myself in your hands and let you come tonight lord and speak through these lips of clay what needs to be said about that's my desire tonight that you would speak through me lord not only that but that you would hear through the people tonight Lord that we can be drawn just a little bit closer to you as a result of being in this service tonight let's our fellowship together Lord let your word find a lodging place in every heart and every life we pray this evening in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ we humbly pray and all the saints said before you're seated this evening we'd like to read from the book of Nehemiah and that if you have a Scofield Bible is page 541 it's right after Ezra and right before Esther I believe it is in the Old Testament you don't hear very very much out of Nehemiah but you're going to tonight amen verse number 11 we want to read before you have your seats Oh Lord I beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servants and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name and to prosper I pray thee thy servant this day and grant him mercy in the sight of this man for I was the king's cup bearer a man may the Lord at his blessings to the reading of the word tonight as you have your seats I'd like to read a little something that I've read the other day and it's this guy reporting of an event that happened in his life he said last week I went to a restaurant I saw it had a Wi-Fi service so I asked for the password and the waitress told me eat first so I placed my order after eating I again ask for the password and again she told me eat first feeling frustrated I ordered some black coffee after coffee I asked once more for the password they told me eat first then angrily I walked to the restaurant manager and asked for the password he replied ate first I was about to explode when I finally saw a sign on the wall that said Wi-Fi password eat first now this exemplifies or makes real to you and I how most of us are waiting for an answer from God after we have prayed and sometimes the Lord is showing us what he's saying to us he's showing us an open door but we keep asking for direction amen we have a young brother in our church that just preached his last or not his last his first sermon last Sunday night and he's 46 47 years old been running from the calling from the Lord for a good long while amen and and and the the signs have been there but he's just not been willing to follow amen and that's the way many of us are many times God has given us the answer where's the answer at brother Joe it's right here in his word amen he's opened the door for us so we're just praying tonight may the Holy Spirit guide us and open our spiritual insight amen to discern the answers to our prayers cause many times he answers them right before our eyes and we fail to recognize it tonight amen now what I want to speak on this evening for just a little bit by the help of the Lord is depend on God I want you to understand you can't depend on a man you can't depend as much as your pastor loves you as much as he does for you as much as he wants to see you blessed and wants to see you prosper I want you to realize you can't depend on him amen because somewhere along the line he's gonna not be able to come at your beck and call he's not gonna be able brother Jim to - to give you what you're looking for and he's gonna let you down praise the Lord because why he's a man now I'm not saying that he's not caring for you is not the concern about you he is a man but you know he you may call and say brother on I need you to come by and talk to me a little bit and he has a flat tire on the way and he can't get there that's what I'm talking about this evening there are circumstances a man that will cause him to let you down unintentionally undesired but as a man circumstances happened this evening Amen so we've got to understand a man that although man will let us down God will never fail us this evening God will never let us down he will never forsake us amen he said I will be with you even in you even to the end of the way tonight amen how near my the writer here are the one that this story is about this evening he was in a place a man he was the king's cup bearer he was writing there in the throne room he was the one Amen that tasted the Kings drink or or tasted his wine before the king drank out it Amen so that the king can know that there was no poison in it because it didn't kill the cupbearer I can drink it now amen he would bring a drink to the King amen and that's what a God is desiring for you and I to do tonight is to bring a drink of praise and worship amen and adoration to the King of Kings a seaman and Lord of lords amen he was in a position of prestige because he wouldn't let just anybody be your cup bearer amen especially in that time frame a man they had to have somebody that they can trust and I want you to understand the night Amen you may think you're nothing you may think you're not the best at what God's called you to do you may think you're a nobody Amen but I want you to understand God has put confidence in you Amen God has put trust in you that you would bring him a drink this evening it wouldn't be poison but it would be a true worship and spirit and in truth tonight amen now in this position where and Nehemiah was said and we're going to maybe look at a few things here by the help of the Lord tonight amen but he he had a position that he he could bend the Kings ear a little bit you know he could talk to the King and he could he could speak to him a man because he was there in that position amen and I want you to understand Amen God puts you in a position that he wants you to be in tonight Amen he opens doors for you Amen sometimes a man let me just give an example many years ago I needed a job a man and and I just didn't know what to do I'd exhausted all of my unemployment I've done everything I could do to try to start a business and do my own thing and it just wouldn't work out I needed a job hey man so I got wind and was told about a position in a drugstore amen and you may have heard this before but hear it one more time tonight a man and when I got that call brother Joe you're you're needing a job here's an opportunity would you like to be the janitor of the drug store in my mind I thought no I really wouldn't but as as we can finish the conversation and and I was going to hang up the phone I heard a voice that said what if I arranged this for you amen so I picked up the phone by the run I called her back I said when can I come for the interview and I worked there for 23 years never missed a day's pay had the insurance from me and my family Amen God provided everytime I get ready to go to the mission field the owner would come around stick some money in my hand and say here we don't want you to get stranded that's his way of saying I want to help you with your mission trip Amen god bless me in that position I had a key for up to the business from day one to the day I left a man I could come and go as I please Amen God was good to me God arranged that he opened the door amen and I would sit up and say no I don't want to walk in it but God said I have arranged this for you this evening amen now sometimes we don't want to see God what God arranges but God has the best plans tonight amen praise the Lord now Nehemiah was in this position where'd he go nehemiah was in this position because God had placed him there it was a time whenever they were in bondage to this current government a man they had been taken captive a man because of their rebellion because they had got away from God and God's in another country another nation in and and took them captive took them prisoners and took them back to the homeland and there they were but thence God amen worked through that King and placed the amah in this position because God look down the line and he saw there was going to be a restoration and there had to be a way to fund that restoration there had to be somebody a man that had a connection tonight a man that could get the support needed to rebuild the city of Jerusalem now once you'd understand Amen God is building his church in this hour Amen he's building it stone upon stone upon stone and he's got to have some people tonight that are willing to be part of that building that God is willing tonight amen and who is that that's you and that's me this evening amen now you know you wonder sometimes why am I where I am just like little Esther is in the next book over a man Mordecai told her maybe God raised you for such a time as this maybe God puts you in that classroom sister Whitney Amen so that you could be an example to those kids maybe God put my daughter-in-law in an in a classroom so she could've helped some of those kids a mentor to guide them amen where they don't get it at home or they don't get it in their support Amen somebody Amen has got to be a witness this evening a man so God's got you there in that position for a reason he knows exactly what he's doing tonight you might say well I don't know why I'm here I don't even know how I got this position Amen but God has a way Amen that passed our finding out tonight and he knows exactly what he's doing this evening amen oh yeah my was there and one day he had a little sadness in his heart maybe that went on for a week or two and finally one day the King looked at he was said let me just put it in my terms Nehemiah what's wrong we've away you've been sad you've been down you've been discouraged you've got a good position the amaya I trust you with my life I trust you with my spirit in your life hey Ben let's get the spiritual side of it as well I trust you I placed myself within you amen I am here amen and you got a good life you your your you're my cupbearer amen you bring me drink and I drink it I trust you near my and listen God has placed himself in you tonight and he trusts you this evening because why he has called you he has placed you yes ordained you for what he had called you for tonight amen and he has trusted you a mint allow you to be in the position called the bride of Jesus Christ this evening why are you so sad Nehemiah what's your wives you countless down and you're just so gloomy and near my said old King said I've got it I've got it good here I've got a good position I thank you for putting me in this position I thank you for the responsibility that you've been trusting me with he said but I've got a people King and I've got a homeland a man and I've got a place that my mind goes back to I've got it good here amen but I remember where I came from who I taydenite saints of God I remember where I came from amen brother Joe how can you remember amen you were in the mind of God that's where I was that Amen I was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world I remember where I came from Amen I thank God they seem that I want to go back where I came from I want to go back to the presence of God I want to go back amen where he is at Amen so that I can dwell in the presence of the Lord forever this evening near my cell I got brethren there there's people of the tribes of Israel that are there and they're struggling a man because you've taken the best of the people you've killed many no doubted and you've taken the best of the people the fairest of them and those that you know you you chose out to be your servants and and my people are still there and I know they're probably struggling I know they're probably having a hard time and listen the night God looks down a man that he sends his servant along your pasture and he knows you go through struggles he knows you have hardship he knows you have difficulty a man he's standing before God day and I go God move for brother so-and-so God moves subsistence also move in this situation because he has a concern for you tonight just like nehemiah he had a concern whether on for the people at home and he said that's why I'm sad Oh King because I know that those people need some help and I know that the house of God is in disrepair I know that the city amen where the king of Israel dwelt a man it needs repair the walls are broken down and it needs to be restored and the King said we'll go build it go build it well I need this and I need resources I need materials take it out of the Kings Treasury Oh I'm dealing it out I need some encouragement take it out of the Kings Treasury I need some financial resources take it out of the Kings Treasury tonight hey man I need some I need some physical help amen you got brothers and sisters that will pray for you and encourage you along the way amen God's got a people Amen that are willing to help tonight if they can just see that there is a need amen they can see the burden that you bear this evening the King said take what you need well what about the Border Patrol what about those that that may be holed up would hold us up along the way amen he said here's a letter I'll sign it and seal it you just present this letter and you won't have no trouble at the border I'm here to tell you I ain't got no letter that I take from church to church but I've got something written upon the table in my heart tonight amen that's sealed until the day of my Redemption a manner that's gonna carry me through no matter what devil tries to stop me at the border no matter what enemy comes against me thank God that letter that seal only inside that's what's gonna carry me through tonight hey man it's not gonna be a church that you're faster its that seal of God whether on Amen that God has placed there Amen when you commit yourself to him and obey his word this evening we find there was a man by the name of David and I'm gonna jump back and forth so you just bear with me David in the midst of a battle one day he longed for a drink of water first Chronicles 1117 David said he longed and said all that one would give me a drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem that is at the gate now no doubt there's a lot of whales in Bethlehem but David remember drinking from a specific will I want you to know tonight you and I we are drinking from a specific will and that's the will of grace tonight that's the will of the blessings of God that's the will of his word this evening amen and that's what's going to carry us through and around David there was some mighty men and those three mighty men hey man let's let's look at them for just a minute David crying out he said if I only had a drink from that will again I'm going to close down I'm reading from brother Branham he said if I only had a drink inside of him cried out a man if I could only drink once more from that well at Bethlehem his desires was a commandment to those means a man they loved him they respected him they've been through thick and thin with him they've been in battle they've been in fights they've been in in the hardships they they had returned back one time and their wives and their children had been taken captive and their houses had been burned amen they've been through the thick with David amen and they respected him they loved him amen and they saw in him a true leader tonight amen and whenever they saw that and they saw that he desired a little drink they said let's go get him boys I can't remember their names no doubt that day he looked over and said hey brother Vernon you've been a prayer warrior a long time you've been fighting this battle a long time you've had some great success in your Christian walk let's go hey man come on over here and they call brother Alvin he said brother Eldon amen let's go you're a mighty man of Valor brother Andrew come on let's go the three of us amen let's go down a man I take amen what the King desires and listen they picked up their sword they pick up their shield and the Bible said they fought for fifteen miles to the well they dropped the bucket they got that water and they fought 15 miles back let me tell you tonight I don't care who you are I don't matter how long you been serving God but you're fighting Devils every day of your life Amen you're fighting spirits of adultery spirits of of lying spirits of thievery Amen spirits amen ah that the devil has sinned out against this ride this evening amen you're fighting got the sword of the word amen you're cutting devils heads off every day as you serve God this evening we're not just fighting for 15 miles we're fighting to the day of our Redemption we're fighting until the day that God comes back and takes us out of this old world tonight amen but they fought they got that water and they come back they handed it to the king Oh King we love you and we respect you and we heard your desire and we wanted to bring you a drink of the water of the wealth of Bethlehem and David took the water in his hands and he looked at it for a long moment and he realized for the and room brother Alden and brother Vernon they had risked their lives for 30 miles there and back to get him that drink of water he recognized that they sacrificed what could have been their last battle just to get him a little water I want to Tate in that friend Amen God looks down as our king of kings and Lord of lords and he sees what you go through he sees the battle that you find you may think I'm going through this all alone nobody here to help me God sees what you're going through God knows that there's a down time he knows the disturbances in your life he knows the situation that you're dealing with and he is aware and he is a he is a God that cares for you tonight David took that water and he said Oh God these men have hazarded their lives and he took that water and he poured it out as an offering to the Lord listen in that friend what we do amen we bring a praise to our King amen we bring a testimony of what God has done in our life and listen that's what they were doing amen they were testifying david has been a great leader he has been a provider he has been a help in the time of struggle he has guided us along the way and I'm going to tell you that's what God has done for us tonight he has levers he has guided as he had directed our footsteps and I and he had brought us to this very hour amen and would we bring our praise and worship what does he do he turns it over and he gives it back to us in blessing this evening brother Bandar would say remember his soul was crying for a drink of that water and those who loved him his least desire was a command we're told that one of the those men got together great me in one killed eight hundred by himself the other one jumped into a pit and killed a lion one took a stick and knocked the spear out of an Egyptians hand and slew him with his own sphere and stood on a field of little like that he killed three hundred men around him greatly and they were Gentiles they weren't Israelites they weren't of the stock of Abraham they meant they were Gentiles tonight just like you and I amen we were not a part of God's great family amen but All Saint's God tonight he didn't leave us out this evening amen he called us Amen when we were unlovable and unworthy and we were dogs tonight but thank God he is grace is sufficient His grace mother down then I could reach up tonight [Applause] pray for my voice brother madam would say wonder in why little Bethlehem he said David here is a type of Christ because christ is david's son here he's standing there crying for a drink of water as his desire was a command i said to those who loved him three of those men pulled her sword about fifteen miles of men down to that city while others fall keeping the lines amen then were gallant fighting me and those Philistines lost their size some of them but they were men gallant who could fight one of them slew stood alone handed killed 800 million right around him in one day they were great me and they trusted God they had faith in their leader and they cut his way down through while until swallow some of them cut and the other one got a bucket of water and they cut their way back through another 15 miles of me and I brought that up to David so he could drink it and what did he do he gave it as an offering to the Lord listen you go out in the world today guess what you're fighting Devils you go on your job and you're fighting Devils you go in your yard and mow your grass right up here you're fighting Devils that goes all the time the Devils talking to you and he's telling you how can you look what you've done look how you said this and how you did that and you call yourself a Christian Amy what is that that's him four listings that simply means that you're having to come against an AI Amen what are you doing you're taking the word of God amen the sword of the Lord and you're saying listen devil amen you may try to put those thoughts in my mind but the word says Amen I am forgiving I am cleanse I am clean I am spotless before the Lord tonight and here's the sword here's a whack a man I'm cutting you down because the word had promised me who I am missing that I'm not a defeated foe I am a victorious Christian I am a child of God tonight he Wars at our mind he tells us all these things but thank God this evening oh yeah he tells you you're gonna die of cancer lying devil he tells you you're gonna lose your job lying devil he tells you nobody loves you lying devil well brother Joe how can you say that I don't have no friends nobody would invite me out to Sunday dinner while the preacher didn't even shake my nobody loves me for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son and like the one that wrote Amazing Grace said for God so loved put your name there you know what you're doing I'm gonna play you cuz I know God said he loved me if nobody in the church loves me God loves if the preacher don't shake my hand God loves a man if to preach it on don't-don't-don't say hello to me God loves me I know this is simple but it's okay because I believe that God is heared and revealed in simplicity so many times Amen we get we want to have such a and in Revelation is wonderful brother Branham said that's the greatest need in the church is divine revelation but one of the greatest revelations of divinity that you can get is Christ in me the hope of glory and if Christ is in you what are you gonna do you are gonna take the Word of God and you are gonna defeat the devil with it no buzz around you what I was for you let me up here brother bet on the gold is one little Bethlehem and he'd say here Christ is represented in this both King and warrior because he cut his way through he broke the enemy's lines of death he broke the enemy's lines that well we might have eternal life the waters of eternal life he came through even to death and took death upon himself and died the death and come back that we might have eternal life he's both King and warrior he didn't come what we didn't conquer it's already conquered he we never conquered death he conquered death for us he's our David of this day he conquered death Bethlehem's bread and water listen when when David smeared got this discouraged and they got down and out they lost their wives and lost their children a man taken captive the houses were burnt listen who was it that steal the people it was named it who was it amendment they wanted to go a man that went when they were weak and tired from battle David said no we gotta catch some rest and then we'll go amen oh let me tell you a night Amen that's what we need to find out in our own experience with God Amen don't go in the heat of the day Amen when everything is here you're tired and weary Amen set your time with God and build your strength this evening we're talking a little bit this afternoon we had an experience in Ireland and there was some demonic spirit that we were dealing with brother Ron had preached and called a prayer line or pray for some people and this woman a man she she needed deliverance but I don't think she got it brother on amen why because many times his brother Ben I'm talking about the maniac in Oregon he worshiped that spirit amen and and brother Owen looked at me said brother Joe are you okay and I said yes sir what he meant by that was this demon amen if things are not right this demon could speak out this demon could call things a man that's not right a man so what I'm saying that to say this or a man if you're not walking close to God you need to get there tonight because I want you to understand you deal with demons every day of your life you deal with Devils on your job in your school in your neighborhood they've been walking down the street go to Walmart they're everywhere hey man have we deal with them that's why we need to come to the house of God every change we get because it's the washing of the water of the word that washes those evil spirits away tonight amen you might say what brother Joe it's a simple message but listen the one said Amen it's the Spirit of God that's walking through his word and washing those Devils out of your life away from you tonight we need to be like the rider said in Psalms 86 and six give your O Lord unto my prayer and attend to the voice of my supplications a man he was saying their Lord hear me I'm crying out to you hear me when I cry listen you know there's so many in today's world in which we live we get so wrapped up and tied up in life that we get up in the morning God God give us a good day God indirect to say man thank you for the food we're about to receive a man and then the next thing you know it's bedtime Lord here I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep you know it takes a little more than that if you're gonna slay Philistines if you're gonna slay Devils it takes a little more to be able to wield the sword of the word this evening amen Psalms 132 Lord hear my voice let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications now we go back to Nehemiah when he spoke to the king listen he didn't come out and say O king my peoples in distress my city is falling down the temple is in disarray no he just hit his head hard he had a burden on his heart he had something that was weighing heavy on his mind and bulging when the King saw that gene why are you so heavy hearted why are you why are you dumb cast he was concerned about his servant a man you you think God don't care God's not concerned I'm here to tell you he is attentive to every prayer he is attentive to the very desires of your heart Amen he knows what you think down in here listen we think naturally with our brain Amen with our mind our intellect remember when we want to do business with God we need to let it drop down in here because he knows the secrets of your heart tonight amen let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications as we said Nehemiah was the cup Bearer why would God allow the rider to write that as the last line of that verse for I was the king's cup bearer because it lets us see tonight Amen that no matter where we're at God is mindful and God is concerned about our situations he was in a position financially no doubt he was doing well he was taking good care of by the King because the King wanted somebody he could trust somebody a man that could drink the wine say okay okay your your majesty here I am I'm still alive I'm doing well I'm not dying from poison here you can drink it's okay now he was in a position of great trust honor and aim element in the Persian court to be in such a place of trust must have been in he must have been in the Kings confidence for know Eastern potentate would have a cut bear to whom he could not trust his life for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth on me I'm sure not perish but have everlasting life all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into the bride the church listen what has he done he has entrusted his life to you this evening amen he's placed a part of himself in you this evening amen the note said they often use poison often administered through the wine amen it was an office much-desired many people wanted his position Amen because it gave access to the king Amen in in those seasons of hilarity when men are most disposed to grant favors in other words amen when the king was feeling good amen the King wanted to do something of somebody amen near my the cup bearer was there listen Amen our King the Lord Jesus Christ amen he's always in a good mood this evening he's always got a willing heart to do something for somebody he's always wanting to help you tonight amen he is there and we're in a good position because why we're not justice we are his wife we're his wife brother joe home there's a lot of great sister set here the church tonight but there's only one that I've called my wife there's only one that can look at me with those big old brown eyes and say honey please no she's a dish lover she likes crystal dishes she likes jewel tea dishes she likes rose dishes she likes all kind of dishes sister Kathy will stop in to yard sale and she'll see a set of dishes or addition I moved that buy that for me give me some money darling honey you got enough dishes you don't need them more but I want it there it's I don't have one like that and it would look real nice beside this one and because there's a love for her well Josh there's something in my heart that

much he loves you and when you come before him and say father I've got a situation I need some help I need I need some deliverance I need some victory listen amen he is more than willing to do it for you tonight he wants to do it more than you want that wanted done but the batam said God needs to give you the Holy Ghost more than you want to have the Holy Ghost tonight on all in points we made the day then go I'm in trouble in other words but that's ok I've lived with it for 41 years I think we can make it a few more you know it's hard to be a preacher's family sister Connie agrees with that one thing because they see the stress that their loved one is going through they see the hardships of dealing with the world amen they see the difficulties and the stress when we get ready to preach our nerves are shocked stomachs rolling you know it's just not a pleasant place to be and then you know we live with them so their choice material for examples but you know God lives with you and that's why he's given us examples in his word because he's seen people and we're people he had people in those days a man that that had situations and had circumstances and he had men for the herald that he could speak through tonight a man that couldn't write down some things and and help us to know how to avoid situations amen I may get back to my notes here I don't want to keep you a favorite length of time than that but Nehemiah was this cutberto King r-texas of Persia and when he was sad before the king as we've already mentioned them out he was so near all mightiness before the king that he could pray and move the heavens he can move the king and he could move the world until Jerusalem was restored and I want you to understand the night you are so near the king Almighty God because why you're his wife you're his chosen one amen when Esther came before the king listen she was hadn't been bitten for thirty days amen but the Jewish people were in trouble they were under a death Death Watch or a death threat from Haman the wicked one a man and she was told by Mordecai ax you were perhaps place here for such a time as this God's gonna deliver his people Mordecai had a positive attitude God's gonna deliver his people hey man but maybe he's gonna use you to do it tonight there may be a sinner down your job there may be a sinner in your neighborhood and God's gonna use you to lead them to the truth tonight to lead him to cries amen we don't know what God's gonna do we just need to be vessels in the hand of God this evening Mordecai told her maybe God raised you up for this purpose maybe God put you here and whenever she walked through the doors of the court that day and the king was sitting on his throne and it was contemplating maybe his next battle or his next adventure and he looked there maybe when she come through the guard said where's your invitation but I'm coming to see the king listen to my friend Amen she may not have had an invitation but you do you're invited into his presence every time you bow on your knees every time you come to the house of God every time you sing the praise I know after our youth meeting the other week Sunday afternoon we didn't have no evening in service so a lot of the saints just hung around the fellowship hall and began to worship and sing songs and rejoice and praise the Lord and all of a sudden the Holy Ghost fell and they began to have a hallelujah do you believe it don't mind you don't have to be in church to get into the presence of God you don't have to be a man I listening to a message of the Prophet you can enter in his presence anytime you so desire this evening and Esther came to the door and when he saw her Amen she knew it was death to come into the presence of the King and listen I I want you to understand it was death for her if the King did not extend that scepter but to you and I its life to sing then to come into his presence amen and rejoice and receive the benefit of that golden scepter that he has extended to us tonight amen if we will just come there and say my king my husband my lover my friend I need a petition before you this evening [Applause] just like Nehemiah had the ear of the king I want you to realize you've not only got his ear but you've got his heart and you can speak to him and he will extend that scepter tonight amen and give you the desire see she only got half of the kingdom I could have only got half the kingdom but tonight with Andrew he has given us all of himself somebody asked how much did he love us and they showed him the picture where he stretched out his arms this much was hanging on the cross he loved us this much a man and listen if he loved us enough but did you have to die for us oh my what would he do amen if we just let him live within us tonight amen as I said dear Bob received letters from the King chapter 2 verse 8 of Nehemiah a letter to ACF to keep her the King's forest that he may give me timber to make beans for the gates of the palace which entertained to the house and for the wall of the city for the house that I shall enter into and the King granted me according to the good hand of my god upon me a man he went down to the lumber yard of King Artaxerxes and said I need 348 for befores three thousand and ninety two two by twos are two befores and thirty thousand brick whatever it was he needed give him the list and he said well how you gonna pay for this here's the Kings decree he said anything I need if I can believe it ask anything in my name and my father will give it thee hey man I know this is simple that's alright near mom 1 through 11 if you read the whole story near my was living in luxury in the Persian kings palace his heart was sensitive to the needs of the people he turned them from tears to prayer and from man to God it shows that when we on an individual basis deal more or or or spend more time with God then our dealings with men will be much more successful amen because what didn't he Amaya do he prayed God give me favor before this King give me favor before this King because I don't have the resources to do it I don't have the ability to do it give me favor with one that does have the ability and does have the means listen to my friend he has given you favor before the King of Kings is evening a man he has made you meet to be partakers of this gospel of this glorious salvation he has made us meet tonight Amen Nehemiah's prayer was so beautiful because it was saturated with God's own word I mean remembers when brother Branham was so blind that he had glasses as thick as coke bottles in his stomach was so eat up with ulcers that he couldn't eat nothing you know what he did God your word says that by your stripes I'm healed your word says that you will put none of these diseases upon me that you put upon the Egyptians and he said Lord I'm taking you at your word mama what's for supper cornbread and beans son fix me a bowl now don't you know the doctor said he's supposed to eat stuff like that it would kill you he said mama that's what the doctor said but God said by His stripes I'm healed fix me the beans and cornbread and he ate him and they come back ate him again and they come back and he ate him again and they stayed down because he took God at His Word and listen he could drive a tack with a 22 rifle time and time and time and time again without glasses how are we tonight to remind him of his promises when we pray Lord you said by your stripes I'm healed Lord you said you'd make me the head and not the tail Lord you said you'd make me to lend and not to borrow Lord you said I could claim my household Lord you said I would be saved and my house Lord you said Amen that that if I would pray and believe when I pray and ask anything in your name that it would be granted Lord that's what you said and I am taking you at your word tonight and I'm taking that word and I'm cutting the head of the devil's off this evening amen let me hear in Phoenix I don't want to keep you all night listen when we're doing well we still need to have a burden for those who are struggling with issues that they can't handle on their own what are we speaking about tonight depend on God amen because he will never never never let you down brother branham prays a prayer in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said Almighty God name of Jesus died soon while you said in your word these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover and Lord's standing here your spirit telling the various secrets of the hearts and things like you said and you did in your Bible I laid my hands while this anointing is upon me upon this woman and may you heal her whatever is wrong with her I know not thou does in Jesus name Amen god bless you sister go rejoicing now and be happy serving the Lord what did he do he took God at His Word he laid hands on the sister and he told her to go rejoicing and believing when John Ron I believe was come before him I believe was John riding them had the blind man a man and and he prayed for him and he said go forth brother you're healed receive your sight and he went off the platform just as blind as he was when he came home so he got back in the prayer line he come back again and he said brother Branham you told me I was healed and he said brother Branham said to him you told me you believe me and he said I do well then go on and confess your healing and he went for a couple of weeks for the wave and he kept telling everybody extra extra read all about it by his stripes I'm healed selling these newspapers a man who went on for about two weeks and he's sitting in the barber chair and the barber began to make fun of him said hey John said I heard he went down to the healing campaign and you you got healed he said that's exactly right praise the Lord I can see I've got my side a man at about that time his eyes flew open a manatee run down the street with a barber's towel around him say shaving cream all over his face extra extra I can see I can see a mint what we need to do tonight is take the Word of God and say I am healed I am delivered I'm set free I'm God and my children are saved amen what Amen upon the basis of your confession the night Christ makes intercession for you well I'm just down and out I got the wowsie wowsie was his brother Jew will see us do you really how many believes in a prophet how many believes in the 20th century prophet you know what he said never in amen our brother Joe that silly no that's not silly that's a positive confession one day and I don't believe it's gonna be too long brother Danny you're gonna look at myself who is that with that head full of hair that's brother Joe the change has taken place raptures on the way I hope this is all right praise the Lord brother Branham says in the time is a hand he said all right we wanted to pray for these just now Heavenly Father we thank thee for these now we thank thee for these now thou us give us a promise that if we ask father anything in the name of Jesus his son he would do it and I'm quoting your word Lord and if you spoke your word back before the foundation of the world and at that very moment you spoke it your son was slain and he was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world yet it taken thousands of years for it to materialize how great is your word and here's your word Lord you said in your word he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life shall never come into punishment or judgment but pass from death to life Jesus you said it and you said that it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those which believe and I have preached the word and these people raised their hands that they believe and accept it how many believers we have tonight now do you accept the Word of God by His stripes are healed by his word a man you your children are gonna come in how's it gonna happen both joint my business to tell you he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved and your house how it's going to happen I have no idea but he said it he's got to fulfill it tonight how is he gonna do it that's a film but thank God I hold the promise tonight I wrap my arms around it and I say Lord it's your word and I accept it tonight I believe it Amy because you said it and you've never told a lie yeah hey man you said Lord I'm healed yes said you said Lord I'm sealed until the day of my Redemption I want to tell you tonight the devil can't get to you unless he crosses that bloodline and if he crosses that bloodline he's gonna be your brother and not your enemy and your brother wouldn't do you no harm or he shouldn't hey man praise the Lord almost done Matthew 21 21 jesus answered and said unto them verily I say unto you if you have faith and doubt not you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if you say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea it shall be done Jesus and the disciples were walking along the road and Jesus was hungry the Bible said and remember he's God in flesh he is the word made flesh amen and he knew by living in this earth and foremost being God that it wasn't season for figs and he went to that fig tree he parted the leaves knowing that it was a season for figs but he knew he created that and he was looking for it to have figs and it didn't have any and he said Kersh said be thou from this day forward a man that don't have the exact words but you can look it up and he cursed it they went on their way did their business mother tooth aniele's what they were going to do came back the next day and the disciples when everybody get the effects Peter come here come come come back Peter eight eight is that the fig tree then he looked for figs on yesterday James come here come here clear look look ain't that the fig tree then he cursed yesterday yeah that's it who is this guy we're with Jesus ask him one time have you been so long with me yet you don't know me don't you realize don't you realize then what I've done you can do it also and even greater than that if you say to this big old mountain back here be moved and cast into the sea it will have to obey what you say if you believe it when you say it Jesus knew there wasn't no figs on that tree but he needed to show those disciples what they possessed in their position as sons of God and not only them but you and me as well this is the power that is within you tonight oh we won't go out to do it all but I want you to know God wants you to have a part in his great program amen he called you for that tonight a man let me let me get done Jesus could speak to them that way and tell them those things because he was the author and the perfecter of faith oh brother Joe my my family member that's lost is his way out yonder in another state faith annihilates time and distance remember brother badams story about his little Barlow knife he said told the audience he said you know I have a little Barlow knife and he said if I reached my hand in my pocket to get it and show it to you believing that it's going to be there when I reach to get it he said even if I left it laying on the dresser in the room when I reached my hand in my pocket and believing that it will be there it will be there amen went to pray for the little girl and he asked her do you have faith yes brother I got faith he said you see that light locking him that light switch he said make it move back and forth Wow brother branham I can't do that nobody can I can't brother branham just watch focused his eyes on it and he showed her what real faith was real faith real faith tonight is believing what ain't as though it is my sister used to work at the drugstore with us and she would come by my office sometimes she'd be in a desperate situation and she'd say brother Joe I want you to agree with me that God will do a certain thing and we would shake hands I say Pat God's Word said if any two or three would agree is touching any thing and believe it that it would be done let's to agree together and we agreed and you can ask her a number of things that we agreed on just by that simple act of - agreeing God did it for her in her situation amen oh brother Joe that's too simple see I told you God was simple amen he don't want to make himself so deep in dark and mysterious that you can't although he is deep and and and and mysterious and the mystical God amen but yet he wants to condescend down to where you can understand that that that he cares for you and he wants to help you he wants to bring you through your situations he wants to give you mercy and give you healing and give you victory and give you deliverance and it may come in the most simplistic form that you wouldn't even think about it's just like in my job situation I've told you about earlier I never thought about going to a place to work and be a janitor I didn't know all of the people's trash out but in simplicity God said what if I arranged this for you and I want you to understand I never lost a day's pay in 23 years the only time I lost pay was when I did ducted my hours when I had to go do something for the church or for brother day and her daddy for you which it was amen and when the boss men saw it and when I had him to sign off on the time sheet to turn in he said why why is your hours less and than 40 I said well because such and such and such he said don't do that again and for 23 years I never lost a day's pay that's my god Romans for 19 20 now I'm trying to get done here and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about in hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God a man James 1 and 6 but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that waver earth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed God don't want us to be driven and tossed a night he wants us to stand flat-footed and say Lord you said it I believe it I accept it I receive it and I'm walking into it I showed you my demonstration of faith while ago listen I'm walking towards that I wish I could put a picture up on the screen to show you how much hair I did have so you know me when you see me where the random tells us he says and you can't say one word to God unless he knows it the weakest of sinked makes the devil's tremble I know we all have these thoughts we feel like we're the weakest link in the chain but if you feel like you're the weakest Christian just remember you make the devil tremble because you're a Christian you may be weak but learn II but that don't matter when you set your foot off the bed his brother Don he says and the devil sees you throw the cover back oh god not again even though you think you're the weakest you still make the devil's tremble and you're his children you have you fully with all your hearts he's gonna be fully laid your life before God and said God mold me to the kind of Christian that's been talked about here tonight I've given my life to you just take the things out of my life that's wrong and make tonight home I'm going by your grace I'll live everyday for you watching for my life to pattern right up with that of the Bible requirements one day the Queen of Sheba came to Solomon because she had heard of his wisdom and when she got there she testified as brother Adam would say it what did she say did she want a class in Beelzebub certainly not she stood right out being a pagan pagan heathen stood right out amongst all the people and said all that I have heard amongst all that I've heard has been the truth and more than I've heard before she'd seen it with her own eyes and the miracle had been performed before on her and she said blessed is the man that stands here by you by you day by day to see these things which are associated with you that stand in your presence and to see great works of the Living God listen blessed are you where's brother Dennis that right there he is right there brother Dennis brother Doug I'm sorry forgive me would you stand brother Doug you've seen a man that was lifeless laid back his eyes rolled back if I remember the story correctly no life thank you brother Doug you have seen miracle babies you have seen great things you've seen a man that was brain dead for 36 hours the doctor is fixing to cut him open and take his heart and his lungs and his organs and give them to somebody else but this same God that we can depend on tonight what did he do he said life and activity back to a brain that was dead he give life to a womb multiple wounds that didn't have no life he took a man that was crushed amen and the doctor said it's impossible I want to tell you something the doctors told my dad Reverend green don't you let that little woman have no more children that was after my sister above me was born because mom had such a hard time don't let her have no more children but God dealt with him and he had me and in the delivery room I was breached birth and the doctor said well Reverend green it looks like it's a 50/50 chance we'll lose the baby and your wife dad went down the hallway to the chapel got on his knees and cried out to God and and he come back and the doctor come out and said Reverend green you got a fine bouncy baby boy and your wife's alright why did that happen because I had to be here tonight to testify to you that you can depend upon God you can put your confidence in him if he tells you something if he tells you something he will perform it if he whisper something in your ear what if I pray what if I arranged this for you he will do it he will take care of you amen he will provide for you we've just got to depend upon him tonight and accept what he has said because he never has failed me or you yet tonight hallelujah you remember I made a statement a few minutes ago when we spend more time with God in prayer and study then Italy reflected in those around us Solomon when he built the temple and it was placed as king he said Oh God I don't know how to go in and come out before this people I don't know how to handle this job and listen I heard somewhere just recently when David was on his deathbed and he called Solomon in and he under where was his brother Danny brother Andrew he called him in there and and he said now Solomon he said your your full-grown you're a grown man and you're fixing the step in the position that's gonna take it's gonna take a grown man to handle it and Solomon knew that even as a grown man he couldn't do it on his own and he bowed his head and said Oh God I don't know how to handle this job I don't know what to do or what to say or how to deal with this people that you've given me charge of he said help me a man that God said because you've asked this and not for riches and fame and fortune he said not only will I give you your heart's desire to be able to have wisdom and and knowledge before the people but I'll also give you riches and fame and fortune and listen Solomon was the greatest king of Israel until Jesus Christ King the natural life must become helplessness until the life of Christ strengthens the natural life the only way to go into fullness with God is for the life of Christ to follow up the natural to swallow up the natural life I love me just one more little little story my dad and Uncle Albert used to get together and pray young preachers young Christians studied the Word of God night after night and grandpa lived out the street from local Albert their dad and grandfather would see their light Uncle Albert slide alone two or three o'clock in the morning and he worked with dad at the venire meal there and and he coming in and he said Henner he never could say Henry he said hinter he said what were you and Albert doing at two o'clock in the morning said I seen your car there dad said well daddy said we were praying and reading the Bible and studying getting close to God and grandpa being just a simple sharecropper with a simple understanding he said you know said son said I've heard people lose their mind when they read that Bible too much and by the way daddy answered him and said daddy said that's what we want to do we want to lose our mind and get the mind of Christ and if we tonight brother Danny will lose our mind and get the mind of Christ amen things will go a whole lot better for us tonight a man stand with me this evening hope I haven't kept you too long tonight but I believe with all of my heart we can depend upon this God sister Tonya sang the song my god is real he's really my soul my God is real for he has washed and made me whole I've been listening to the message brethren preached Christ is the mystery of God revealed and brother Ron in there he's talking about a saving God and he said in so many words he said brother about him how do you know he saves he said cause I've had the experience how do you know it's real because I've seen him real in my life I was there I guess I wouldn't know I've seen the reality of this god and I know that I can depend on him I know tonight that what he has promised in his word if I believe it if you'll do what I have need of amen if I believe it and accept it he's promised to provide my every need maybe as we bow our heads tonight you've got a need in your heart a burden for somebody a burden for a situation in your life would you just slip up your hand not to brother job with to the Lord tonight as we bow our hearts now Heavenly Father God hands all over the building tonight morning god I can do nothing about the situation's I can't heal I can't provide finances for all the financial needs no doubt are prevalent but God you've promised that you would link away when there seemeth to be no way you've promised Lord that by your stripes we are healed or there's those that are facing treatments and surgeries even my own brother Lord Faison some surgery possibly is treatments chemotherapy but God tonight you have declared in your work that by your stripes that you bore before you went to Calvary's you to die in our place no stripes Lord but not because you deserved it not because Lord you had
