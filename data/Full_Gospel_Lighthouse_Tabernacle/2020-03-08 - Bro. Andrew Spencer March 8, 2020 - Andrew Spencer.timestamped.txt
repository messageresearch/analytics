[1:04:32] brother on has been it's been spitting
[1:04:34] up different things and and brother on
[1:04:38] he'd seen these things and he
[1:04:41] immediately thought that they were the
[1:04:44] lesions maybe in his chest or whatnot so
[1:04:46] so they he was able to catch one today
[1:04:50] and so as soon as that happened today
[1:04:53] they they did a chest x-ray and so from
[1:04:57] what I understand his last chest x-ray
[1:05:00] was on February the 20th and then they
[1:05:03] took one a day and they said that they
[1:05:06] said today from the last x-ray to this
[1:05:09] x-ray that things have improved
[1:05:12] significantly I said we can't explain
[1:05:15] those things but we can
[1:05:24] we can
[1:05:33] oh yeah we're feeding these buzzards of
[1:05:37] cancer to the pigs one at a time a man
[1:05:42] and so they they scheduled an MRI on
[1:05:45] brother on at 2:00 o'clock today and so
[1:05:49] the doctors the doctors came in and read
[1:05:51] it and the surgery did its job and his
[1:05:56] scan was the scan was perfect and so
[1:05:59] they said there's just a spot of blood
[1:06:01] there or where they did the surgery at
[1:06:03] and said there's nothing to be concerned
[1:06:05] with there but we know that this is a
[1:06:07] marathon this is not a sprint so we want
[1:06:11] to point to you these victories that
[1:06:13] these are huge victories these are huge
[1:06:16] victories and so we're just very
[1:06:19] thankful we'll take we'll take the
[1:06:21] little slightest liver sliver of a
[1:06:24] victory at any moment because we know
[1:06:28] that these things are of God and we're
[1:06:31] just expecting nothing but full victory
[1:06:33] but in all of this process you keep your
[1:06:36] eyes on the Word of God no matter if you
[1:06:39] get good news or bad news you keep your
[1:06:41] eyes on the world and we won't get
[1:06:43] caught up in the delay of time and
[1:06:45] things we'll just we'll receive it as
[1:06:47] God gives it to us I like I'd like to
[1:06:50] share this with you tonight I've asked
[1:06:52] the brothers if they could play this
[1:06:53] clip of this sermon brother on preached
[1:06:58] a few years back in sister Ana was so
[1:07:00] and to share it with us today I'd
[1:07:02] actually had actually told our pastor to
[1:07:05] go and listen to this sermon that he had
[1:07:07] preached a few years ago Satan you can't
[1:07:11] take his life and so if the brothers
[1:07:13] could do that for us this evening and I
[1:07:16] would like to share that with you it's
[1:07:17] that okay man god bless you if you could
[1:07:20] hit the lights for us there and make a
[1:07:33] declaration Satan
[1:07:35] you can't take his life before I read my
[1:07:42] scriptures I just want to just share a
[1:07:45] couple of words with you if I could if I
[1:07:48] could just if you just give me just a
[1:07:50] moment there are no miracles without
[1:07:54] messes no miracles without great trials
[1:08:02] no miracles without dark hours let me
[1:08:07] just share a couple with you Sarah
[1:08:10] endured 90 years of frustrating
[1:08:13] humiliation of barrenness before a
[1:08:15] miracle baby Moses was leading them to
[1:08:19] million slaves to their slaughter at the
[1:08:22] hands of Pharaoh and his chariots before
[1:08:25] the Red Sea open and allowed him to pass
[1:08:27] through on dry ground
[1:08:31] thousands of people grew tired and weary
[1:08:35] before Jesus multiplied fish and bread
[1:08:38] enough for every one of them to feast a
[1:08:41] widow and her son had to be starving to
[1:08:46] death ahead of an unlimited bent bin of
[1:08:49] flour and an unending horrible daniel
[1:08:54] had to be thrown in the lion's den
[1:08:56] before he could be spared from even a
[1:08:59] scratch Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[1:09:03] were thrown into the furnace prior to
[1:09:06] being protected so they completely could
[1:09:10] be saved by the son of God and no one
[1:09:13] could even smell the smoke on them
[1:09:17] bartimaeus had to experience a lifetime
[1:09:19] of blindness prior to experience the
[1:09:23] great physicians Healing Touch Jesus
[1:09:27] would have never had to free the man of
[1:09:29] them the tombs which
[1:09:32] called Legion of demons if the man had
[1:09:35] not been demonized in the first place
[1:09:37] then lepers had not had to experience
[1:09:40] leprosy before experiencing the miracle
[1:09:43] of their healing Peter had to go to
[1:09:45] prison before the angel the Lord would
[1:09:48] unlock his chains and set him free had
[1:09:53] to die before he could raise from the
[1:09:57] dead I stand here as a witness to not I
[1:10:03] could have been burned up my lungs could
[1:10:08] have collapsed burned 75% and they could
[1:10:13] be literally deteriorating even tonight
[1:10:15] I could have died and my harvesters my
[1:10:18] look my organs be harvested I could be
[1:10:22] paralyzed tonight from my neck down
[1:10:24] because they said I'd never walk again
[1:10:27] I could have succumbed to a lightning
[1:10:30] bolt snake bucks heart attacks strokes
[1:10:36] those are just a few of the trials that
[1:10:38] I have been through but I want to stand
[1:10:41] here tonight and declare before living
[1:10:44] witnesses that Jesus Christ is still in
[1:10:47] the building
[1:10:49] [Applause]
[1:10:55] I stand here not as a novice reading
[1:11:00] youth poetry or trying to tickle your
[1:11:03] ear
[1:11:03] I stand here commissioned by the word of
[1:11:06] the Living God to cut the devil's head
[1:11:10] off at every corner here this afternoon
[1:11:18] amen
[1:11:19] so if you'll turn with me in your
[1:11:21] scriptures tonight to John chapter 12 I
[1:11:24] believe he's I believe we're in for a
[1:11:27] wonderful night don't you John chapter
[1:11:33] 12 and verse 1 Satan behold he is in thy
[1:11:40] hand but save his life you know how much
[1:11:51] how much Satan hates to hear this rant
[1:11:54] across the pulpit you know how much
[1:11:58] Satan hates to hear this read it's your
[1:12:01] home in your Bible studies do you know
[1:12:05] how many nightmares that he has been
[1:12:07] given that he unleashed everything that
[1:12:11] he could against a man
[1:12:16] he unleashed the greatest trial that you
[1:12:19] could ever be given to a human being and
[1:12:24] get all of and in all of that releasing
[1:12:29] of all of that trouble on top of a man
[1:12:31] that man caught a revelation with God
[1:12:36] and what's that revelation became a
[1:12:39] reality in his love that's not a devil
[1:12:43] in hell that could shake him from the
[1:12:45] promises of God the prophet of God Satan
[1:12:53] Satan may ping you in a corner without
[1:12:56] with cancer God will make a way of
[1:13:01] escape

[1:17:49] tonight we'll look over in the book of
[1:17:51] Acts chapter 2 verse 1 through 4 and
[1:17:55] then to 2nd Peter chapter 1 and verse 21
[1:18:00] and we'd like to continue our thought on
[1:18:03] God is with us and we will see miracles
[1:18:05] and just a little sideline thought on
[1:18:09] the same wind is passing through this
[1:18:12] place the same wind of the Holy Ghost is
[1:18:15] moving I believe that tonight with all
[1:18:18] that is within me that the Holy Ghost is
[1:18:21] here to meet every single one of our
[1:18:22] needs do you believe that tonight the
[1:18:26] Bible tells us blessed is he that cometh
[1:18:28] in the name of the Lord I'd say you're
[1:18:30] blessed tonight can you raise your hand
[1:18:32] and say you're blessed tonight a man
[1:18:34] Acts chapter 2 and verse 1 and when the
[1:18:38] day of Pentecost was fully come they
[1:18:40] were all with one Accord in one place
[1:18:43] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:18:45] heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and
[1:18:49] it filled all the house where they were
[1:18:51] sitting and they appeared unto them
[1:18:54] there and there appeared unto them
[1:18:56] cloven tongues as of a fire and it set
[1:18:59] upon each of them and they were all
[1:19:02] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[1:19:05] speak with other tongues as the Spirit
[1:19:08] gave them utterance 2nd Peter chapter 1
[1:19:12] and verse 21 for the prophecy came not
[1:19:17] in old time by the will of man but holy
[1:19:21] men of God spake as they were moved by
[1:19:25] the Holy Ghost may God bless his word he
[1:19:28] may be seated in the presence of the
[1:19:30] Lord acts 2 and 2 says and suddenly
[1:19:35] there came a sound from heaven as of a
[1:19:38] rushing mighty wind and it filled all
[1:19:40] the house where they were sitting at I
[1:19:42] pray that that same wind of the Holy
[1:19:45] Ghost comes into this building tonight
[1:19:47] and UBA again to you begin to feel the
[1:19:49] breeze of the Holy Ghost as he slips
[1:19:52] over your soul as we see here as in 2nd
[1:19:56] Peter chapter 1 that we realized that
[1:19:58] that the prophecy of God was not given
[1:20:01] by the will of man but it came it came
[1:20:04] by the will of God as they were moved by
[1:20:07] the Holy Ghost and and we realized that
[1:20:10] these men were influenced and inspired
[1:20:12] by God - to speak the things of God they
[1:20:16] were they were moved to speak to
[1:20:18] prophesy though it may have been time
[1:20:21] that there would have been a time of
[1:20:23] delay were able to watch that word being
[1:20:26] a prophet they were able to watch that
[1:20:29] word and see when it was coming to its
[1:20:31] spot and maybe it maybe it seemed like
[1:20:34] it was never going to come but yet that
[1:20:36] word had to come to materialisation
[1:20:39] because it was not them speaking you see
[1:20:42] God didn't allow them to just speak of
[1:20:44] their own accord but God
[1:20:47] speak his word and that we realized that
[1:20:50] that surely our God will do nothing
[1:20:52] unless he reveals himself to his
[1:20:55] servants the prophets and we see that
[1:20:57] these men of God they would speak the
[1:20:59] word as the wind of a breath would
[1:21:02] inspire them to speak and they would
[1:21:05] come to the generation that they were
[1:21:06] allotted to come to and they would they
[1:21:08] would speak the things of God and they
[1:21:10] would they would watch those things
[1:21:12] materialize and you can look all the way
[1:21:14] back into the Old Testament and you can
[1:21:17] see how that how the prophecy was
[1:21:19] rolling there and and there were men
[1:21:22] like Isaiah and men like Elisha that
[1:21:24] maybe there were prophecies that came
[1:21:26] forth that maybe they didn't necessarily
[1:21:28] see right in front of them but yet the
[1:21:31] prophecy was still hanging there and
[1:21:34] tonight to realize that there's prophecy
[1:21:36] that's hanging over top of you as
[1:21:38] individuals that those things that are
[1:21:41] going to come to pass there's there's
[1:21:43] earth there's that he is the Lord our
[1:21:45] God that heals us there's a promise
[1:21:48] that's hanging over you he said that he
[1:21:50] would bless you coming in and going out
[1:21:52] he said that he would make you the head
[1:21:54] and not the tail he said that he would
[1:21:56] put you above and not beneath those
[1:21:58] promises that are hanging over top of
[1:22:00] you and a lot of times there's an enemy
[1:22:02] that's standing there in the gap or in a
[1:22:05] block as it were and he's trying to keep
[1:22:07] that promise from getting to you but I
[1:22:10] want to assure you as the people of God
[1:22:12] that no matter the attack no matter what
[1:22:16] you go through no matter the oppression
[1:22:18] there is a promise there and if God has
[1:22:21] a promise that is intended for you as an
[1:22:23] individual it's got to come to
[1:22:25] materialisation you see that promise is
[1:22:29] more real than you are tonight are you
[1:22:32] with me tonight that promise is more
[1:22:34] real than than you are tonight and your
[1:22:36] faith can reach out and say that that
[1:22:39] promise that's hanging there for me I
[1:22:41] receive that in the name of the Lord
[1:22:43] I receive that for myself I receive that
[1:22:46] for my household I receive that for my
[1:22:49] life I receive that for my marriage I
[1:22:51] receive that for my children
[1:22:53] we display that token and we express
[1:22:56] that token that this is none other than
[1:22:59] the life of Jesus Christ in this day and
[1:23:01] we watch that prophecy as it is inspired
[1:23:05] by men of God as we watch it as it
[1:23:07] begins to roll and let it just roll by
[1:23:10] your way tonight as I speak tonight
[1:23:12] maybe you're not maybe maybe you're
[1:23:14] catching up to where I am but I'm asking
[1:23:17] you as as believers tonight to say amen
[1:23:20] to the word and and to believe the word
[1:23:23] and let that prophecy roll right over
[1:23:25] top of your situations roll right over
[1:23:28] to roll right over top of your unbelief
[1:23:32] and let that word a prophecy squash your
[1:23:36] unbelief are you with me tonight now
[1:23:40] brother madam said that each generation
[1:23:42] has its own revival it has a chance at
[1:23:45] the Word of God so I'll look out upon
[1:23:47] you and you are a generation of people
[1:23:50] that that you have a fresh chance at the
[1:23:52] word tonight young people I want you to
[1:23:55] hear me I hope you listening right well

[1:24:01] a chance to receive in this generation

[1:24:08] message brother Adam said it and it's
[1:24:10] got to come that every generation all
[1:24:13] the way from Reagan all the way to
[1:24:15] little Isaac all the ways got a chance
[1:24:17] at the word now Satan's tried to steal
[1:24:20] that chance away from you he's tried to
[1:24:22] stuff all kinds of things down and your
[1:24:24] throat and down into your soul to keep
[1:24:26] you from getting through that and he's
[1:24:28] tried to block you with all types of
[1:24:30] different things to keep you from
[1:24:32] getting through the word he's put sin in
[1:24:34] your life he's put cigarettes in your
[1:24:37] life he's put troubles in your life but

[1:24:51] of second chances he's the god of many
[1:24:53] chances you get back up you ain't gotta

[1:25:16] guarding never failed you can look
[1:25:18] through the time-space and you can look
[1:25:20] there was prophecy and that was hanging
[1:25:23] there but they're politically responds
[1:25:26] that came and they tried to destroy the
[1:25:28] Word of God but it never worked
[1:25:30] there was kingdoms had tried to stop the
[1:25:33] move of God but it never worked
[1:25:35] why because God's Word will always come
[1:25:38] to pass they became to pass in those
[1:25:42] circumstances of the Old Testament what
[1:25:45] about you and I when we sat here under a
[1:25:48] blood covenant with a token over our
[1:25:50] lives filled with a baptism of the Holy
[1:25:53] Ghost that God's not some way far off up
[1:25:56] in heaven but deities living on the
[1:25:58] inside of you and deity is bringing that
[1:26:01] promise to pass it's bringing it to pass
[1:26:06] hallelujah opposition's trying to knock
[1:26:10] us down suffering tried to knock us down
[1:26:12] but the word still remained God is God
[1:26:19] he's a God that don't give up he's a God
[1:26:23] that don't back down and for God's on my
[1:26:26] side I'm gonna go all the way with Jesus
[1:26:30] we used to sing that song is a choir I'm
[1:26:32] going all the way I'm going with Jesus
[1:26:35] all the way you remember it's all I'm
[1:26:39] going with Jesus all the way well
[1:26:40] actually troops tonight it's been a
[1:26:42] while since we sung it but I want you to
[1:26:44] know it's a testament in my soul that
[1:26:46] I'm doing Jesus all the way he made not
[1:26:49] high Satan may knock me down but I'm
[1:26:51] going Jesus all the way he may try to
[1:26:55] afflict me but I'm still going Jesus all
[1:26:57] the way he may try to turn me but I'm
[1:27:00] going Jesus all the way for sickness I'm
[1:27:03] going with Jesus through Tom oh I'm
[1:27:05] golfing with Jesus
[1:27:08] there's a god that god of a force Burt
[1:27:12] you may not feel it but he's away maker
[1:27:16] he's behind this water with all of his
[1:27:19] strength he's behind it full force
[1:27:25] tonight and he's going to bring it to
[1:27:27] pass but will you allow him to bring it
[1:27:31] to pass will you allow him to move well
[1:27:36] we look over in the book of Genesis
[1:27:38] chapter 2 and verse 7 and the Bible
[1:27:41] tells us that the Lord God formed man
[1:27:43] out of the dust of the ground and
[1:27:45] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[1:27:48] life and man became and man became a
[1:27:52] living soul you can imagine as the
[1:27:55] prophet of the Lord would show us show
[1:27:58] us of this in an even he would describe
[1:28:00] it in such major detail as he would
[1:28:03] watch Adam and Eve as they were walking
[1:28:05] through the garden as he would as Adam
[1:28:08] would walk down through there and he
[1:28:10] would begin to spit off the names of
[1:28:12] animals that he had that he had the the
[1:28:15] ability to name because God gave him
[1:28:18] that ability he was able to name it
[1:28:21] because you see he'd watch that
[1:28:23] character of that horse that he was a
[1:28:25] beast of power and he taught it a horse
[1:28:27] and he and he's seen the characteristics
[1:28:29] of a lion and a lamb and he named all
[1:28:32] these things according to their
[1:28:33] characteristics he could tell her now
[1:28:36] I've named this arose I've named this
[1:28:39] allele he and you see these things were
[1:28:42] these things were characterized by their
[1:28:45] life and Adam was able as the son of God
[1:28:48] as an amateur God to turistic and see
[1:28:53] the life of that animal see the life of
[1:28:55] that plan see the life behind it and he
[1:28:58] named it so if you as a son of God can
[1:29:02] look at the character of a demon of
[1:29:04] melanoma you realize the character of it
[1:29:07] and you know where it came from
[1:29:10] are you with me we realize that we are
[1:29:13] facing the time but as sons of God we
[1:29:16] realize the expression of that demon of
[1:29:19] cancer is coming from a source oh if you
[1:29:24] could trace back the source just now you
[1:29:26] can allow the wind of the Holy Ghost to
[1:29:29] go into that realm and burn it out you
[1:29:33] see the enemy would love to put jealousy
[1:29:35] up on top of you and some of me has some
[1:29:38] of you are so jealous that you're afraid
[1:29:40] to walk out of the building because
[1:29:42] you're afraid that somebody's going to
[1:29:44] steal your a wife or steal your husband
[1:29:47] but if you can allow the Holy Ghost to
[1:29:49] go into that channel and begin to allow
[1:29:52] him to move he can burn all those things
[1:29:55] out of you you don't have to deal with
[1:29:57] those things but you watch Adam as he's
[1:30:01] as he's dealing with these things you
[1:30:04] see something was moving him to name
[1:30:06] them something was moving him to express
[1:30:10] these things and this he's walking down
[1:30:13] for the guard and as he's watching and
[1:30:16] he's looking and Eve all of a sudden the
[1:30:19] wind begins to brood and it begins to
[1:30:22] move through the Garden of Eden and he
[1:30:26] just got done putting the curves in her
[1:30:27] head and all of a sudden the wind starts
[1:30:31] blowing it like she's got a head snuck
[1:30:33] out of a corner and he said Adam I just
[1:30:35] don't like it that way and Adam says
[1:30:37] it's no problem I can control that for
[1:30:41] you I've got that for you and he just
[1:30:44] speaks and the wind turns and goes the
[1:30:47] other direction he begins to say now
[1:30:50] look on the other side of that mountain
[1:30:52] is a beautiful river and on and that
[1:30:55] river just flows and the water is so
[1:30:57] gentle
[1:30:58] it's so perfect he said well I can't see
[1:31:00] it from here and these birds speak and
[1:31:03] he have the ability to move a mountain
[1:31:04] if there was a tree in his way he was
[1:31:07] able to move that tree just to fit his
[1:31:10] vision of what he wanted to see now
[1:31:13] there are things that are standing in
[1:31:16] front of you that is blocked
[1:31:18] that's fish in a few but there's a pride
[1:31:22] that will remove those hangs out of
[1:31:25] God's fish if you will a little the same
[1:31:28] wind of the Holy Ghost that comes
[1:31:30] slipping through your Avenue just now
[1:31:32] he'll take the tear
[1:31:34] he will take a bulldozer the Holy Ghost
[1:31:36] and come through your tin can alley
[1:31:39] he'll move those that are blocking you
[1:31:43] from getting to Jesus that are blocking
[1:31:46] you from being the perfect picture of
[1:31:48] what Jesus has saw of you before the
[1:31:50] foundation of the world glory he was a
[1:31:57] God on earth he was an amateur God but
[1:32:02] we know through the fall and for
[1:32:04] reasoning powers that Adam lost his
[1:32:07] Dominion he lost his Dominion he lost
[1:32:10] his sonship but don't you be disturbed
[1:32:13] by that before Adam ever fail there was
[1:32:17] a lamb that had redeemed him before the
[1:32:21] foundation of the world you see because
[1:32:24] Obama has told us that those who he for
[1:32:27] no Vimy also called
[1:32:30] and for God to allow fellowship he
[1:32:33] allowed the sacrifice of a lamb to
[1:32:36] redeem them the lamb was provided for
[1:32:41] album Adam because he had already and
[1:32:43] his nostrils became the breath of
[1:32:45] eternal life of God and he become a
[1:32:48] living soul he was a son of God he had
[1:32:51] power like God he was an amateur God
[1:32:57] you can imagine how Adam felt walking
[1:33:02] out of the garden you can imagine how he
[1:33:06] walks out of the garden but he realizes
[1:33:09] that he's walking out with a promise
[1:33:13] hanging over top of him he's walking out
[1:33:16] realizing a little walk in that again
[1:33:21] they have fallen from the spot where you
[1:33:25] knew that you should have been walking
[1:33:26] but you can walk in that spot again you
[1:33:30] can raise back up to that spot again
[1:33:33] this helps in in my life and it knocked
[1:33:36] me down you can walk in that spot again
[1:33:38] are you with me tonight Church you may
[1:33:41] have been knocked down in your mind or
[1:33:43] looked at the road things set their own
[1:33:44] things maybe maybe your temper got the
[1:33:47] best of you but you can walk in that
[1:33:49] spot of the Sun again whoo hallelujah
[1:33:53] but he realizes he's he's walking out
[1:33:55] that there's a promise of one that is
[1:33:58] coming when God was speaking to the
[1:34:00] serpent and it tells him that I will put
[1:34:02] enmity between thee and the woman see
[1:34:05] you see God was telling him that there's
[1:34:09] one common there's one common you may
[1:34:12] have been able to trick Eve but you will
[1:34:15] not be able to trick this set it out and
[1:34:17] neither will you be able to trick the
[1:34:19] second Eve you see what Eve turned down
[1:34:22] we except now it was what's the anointed
[1:34:26] man now the anointed bride what are you
[1:34:30] anointed with the same anointing power
[1:34:32] with the same Holy Ghost with the same
[1:34:34] wind that fell in the day of Pentecost
[1:34:36] [Music]
[1:34:37] [Applause]
[1:34:39] and as you watch says who watch as that
[1:34:42] second Adam came on a scene he
[1:34:44] controlled the atmosphere he control
[1:34:47] demons
[1:34:49] he controlled the winds he controlled
[1:34:54] the atoms he controlled the waves what
[1:34:57] have we seen in this thing what have we
[1:35:02] seen in this day when a man when the
[1:35:03] Prophet was on Colorado Mountain what
[1:35:06] we've seen in this day and he controlled
[1:35:08] the storms and he controlled the winds
[1:35:11] what is it selling you as the Church of
[1:35:12] the Living God at the same wind
[1:35:15] he's blowing on the inside of your soul
[1:35:21] prophet said in things that are to be it
[1:35:24] was easy for those Jews who had been
[1:35:26] taught for generations to believe that
[1:35:28] there was a great supernatural God but
[1:35:31] to think that God had come down and was
[1:35:34] manifesting himself to the person of a
[1:35:36] son Jesus Christ God and tabernacled in
[1:35:39] the body of flesh that was a little too
[1:35:42] much for them to understand you see it
[1:35:46] because the Bible had told us that the
[1:35:49] Word was made flesh and would dwell
[1:35:51] amongst us and that's exactly what had
[1:35:54] happened you see when God came in the
[1:35:57] form of his son Jesus he was God
[1:36:00] manifested in the body of flesh that
[1:36:03] light that no man could approach was
[1:36:05] manifested in the body of flesh the God
[1:36:08] that no man was permitted to see at any
[1:36:10] time was merited and manifested in the
[1:36:12] flesh the pillar of fire was manifested
[1:36:15] in the flesh the pillar of cloud that
[1:36:16] would keep them caught at bay was
[1:36:18] manifested in the flesh the God of
[1:36:20] Israel was now manifested in the flesh
[1:36:23] the god of the prophets was now
[1:36:25] manifested in the flesh the holy God of
[1:36:28] sinful people was now manifested in the
[1:36:31] flesh and the fullness of the Godhead
[1:36:33] was now manifested in bodily in the
[1:36:36] flesh in Christ Jesus and what did the
[1:36:39] scripture tell us that he is Emmanuel
[1:36:42] God with us
[1:36:44] was now manifested in the flesh it was
[1:36:48] God in morphe he was masking himself in
[1:36:51] the pillar fire masking himself in a man
[1:36:54] called Jesus
[1:36:55] now he's masking himself in a body it's
[1:36:59] God with us God above us and God in us
[1:37:03] it's the continent sending God all the
[1:37:06] way down throughout eternity and here
[1:37:09] this God was in human flesh it was a
[1:37:12] little too hard for them to understand
[1:37:14] that this God was now living in a body
[1:37:17] and Nicodemus being a secret believer he
[1:37:20] watched these things
[1:37:21] he watched the actions of this man
[1:37:24] called Jesus he watched how he acted he
[1:37:27] watched how he performed miracles and
[1:37:30] Nicodemus came to a nighttime because he
[1:37:32] was afraid that he would get kicked out
[1:37:34] of his organization and he came to him
[1:37:37] and he told him he said master we know
[1:37:39] that thou art a teacher that's come from
[1:37:41] God for no man can do these works unless
[1:37:44] God be with him he was telling him that
[1:37:47] I realized that the God of Abraham is
[1:37:51] with you the miracles that I see that I
[1:37:54] perform in brother arts way rather our
[1:37:57] brother Doug heal rather held in Frazier
[1:38:00] I realize that there's a God and no man
[1:38:04] can do these things except God be with
[1:38:08] you see for us sometimes we get caught
[1:38:11] up we get caught up a lot of times we
[1:38:16] get accustomed to miracles we get
[1:38:22] accustomed to the supernatural and a lot
[1:38:24] of times you'll set right there and
[1:38:26] think well that's just another miracle
[1:38:28] that's not just another miracle that was
[1:38:30] God and a lot of times you just brush it
[1:38:34] off and how I realized I realized that
[1:38:37] there was a testimony that just came
[1:38:39] forth from brother Archer that was a
[1:38:40] miracle
[1:38:42] but some of you thought well I didn't
[1:38:44] see Claude and app say sister and was
[1:38:46] looking at God that day that that was
[1:38:50] God to me I saw God today in the body of
[1:38:53] Ron Spitzer I saw God today what I see
[1:39:00] him and I saw me myself I saw him in you
[1:39:04] we should never be accustomed to the
[1:39:07] things of God that these things are
[1:39:09] supernatural he said well I just don't
[1:39:13] see it do you realize for you to be here
[1:39:16] today is a miracle you should never get
[1:39:21] accustomed to it's just another day you
[1:39:24] have been granted a 24-hour slot of time
[1:39:28] that you do with it man alive can you
[1:39:35] unlock most telling you I am giving you
[1:39:39] this time to go out and do what you want
[1:39:42] to with it and I'm still gonna pay oh my
[1:39:46] I hope you hear me preaching to you
[1:39:48] tonight you got 24 hours to give God all
[1:39:51] the praise and still get blessed spots
[1:39:55] you got 24 hours to live your life and
[1:39:59] such a spot that you overcome every
[1:40:02] demon of hell
[1:40:03] that's a miracle well I can't get my
[1:40:09] hair done in time I had to brush 14
[1:40:11] pairs of teeth today because that's how
[1:40:14] many children I got maybe you shouldn't
[1:40:15] have had 14 children if all you're gonna
[1:40:17] do is complain because you miss seeing
[1:40:20] God and all other things that he's done
[1:40:23] for you
[1:40:25] 24 hours and in that 24 hours I choose
[1:40:29] to pray like never before I choose to
[1:40:32] worship like never before
[1:40:35] aren't so much in a preaching mode that
[1:40:38] I'm even going to preaching in my sleep
[1:40:40] just ask my life she just got right
[1:40:46] behind me it's are they mad at me last
[1:40:48] night while I was preaching I say you
[1:40:52] need to write this stuff down
[1:40:56] what is it it's where we're living at oh
[1:41:00] my you know how the enemy loves to come
[1:41:04] and tour meet you in the night time
[1:41:05] because you see comes to you when you're
[1:41:08] not on your god as it were and he
[1:41:11] affects your subconscious and you have a
[1:41:13] nightmare
[1:41:14] and Satan afflicts your whole day
[1:41:16] because of that I say oh god I pray you
[1:41:20] seal us where the Holy Ghost that you'll
[1:41:22] protect our dreams and that we will not
[1:41:25] be affected by Satan's nightmare but we
[1:41:28] will become Satan's nightmare the pray
[1:41:32] that were so filled with the baptism of
[1:41:35] the Holy Ghost that when the enemy looks
[1:41:37] at us he starts running for cover what
[1:41:43] is it
[1:41:44] he's witness that win before an attack
[1:41:46] defeated before four gospel lighthouse
[1:41:49] this same wind is in the building and it
[1:41:53] will defeat Satan any time any place
[1:41:55] under any situation this is God
[1:42:00] [Applause]
[1:42:03] Nicodemus he was not accustomed to
[1:42:06] seeing these things hey how do I get
[1:42:14] this how do I get this power and Jesus
[1:42:17] said unless you be born again you cannot
[1:42:20] understand the things of God but because
[1:42:24] you're not born again you'll not be able
[1:42:26] to understand it but you see to those it
[1:42:30] seems so elementary to you to do that
[1:42:32] have been born again but you realize how
[1:42:35] big it was when you wasn't born again
[1:42:38] and you see sometimes we get caught up
[1:42:41] we'll get born again but you see let's
[1:42:45] allow them to look at the god that's in
[1:42:48] front of him and receive that God and
[1:42:50] worship that God and becoming in such an
[1:42:53] experience with that God like never
[1:42:55] before don't just put it off where you
[1:42:58] just need to be born again what you need
[1:43:00] to do is just die out you need to die
[1:43:03] out to yourself and we don't need to
[1:43:05] push these things off this is the
[1:43:07] ultimate right here because jesus said
[1:43:11] you must be born again I didn't see I
[1:43:16] didn't see where there's any room for
[1:43:18] excuse right there or any room for
[1:43:21] interpretation he said you must and if
[1:43:23] Jesus said you must well I'm gonna take
[1:43:26] Jesus at his word so what am I going to
[1:43:28] do to you I'm going to preach to you
[1:43:30] that you must be born again
[1:43:32] to understand the things of God they
[1:43:37] seen these things before but they were
[1:43:39] captivated and disturbed by this man
[1:43:41] called Jesus John chapter 3 in verse 6
[1:43:45] Jesus said that was his born of the
[1:43:47] flesh is flesh and that which is born of
[1:43:50] the Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I
[1:43:52] said unto thee you must be born again
[1:43:55] the wind bloweth where it listeth and
[1:43:58] thou hears the sound thereof but canst
[1:44:01] not tell whence it cometh and whither it
[1:44:04] goeth so is every one that is born of
[1:44:06] the Spirit you see you can judge the
[1:44:10] wind by its effects wind is a very
[1:44:15] powerful thing you look out upon the
[1:44:18] landscape of the earth and you will you
[1:44:21] realize and see how powerful the wind is
[1:44:24] how that it changes mountaintops and how
[1:44:27] it blows across that mountain in it and
[1:44:29] it shaves it it shaves it in such a spot
[1:44:33] wind is so powerful that it breaks trees
[1:44:36] wind is so powerful that it moves desert
[1:44:39] mountains and it blows the sand the
[1:44:41] grain of sand and it blows in and it
[1:44:44] forms new mountains and new valleys
[1:44:46] because when does that
[1:44:48] powerful wind changes the systems of
[1:44:51] weather in the sky wind will move
[1:44:54] anything that ain't tied down and wind
[1:44:56] will even change your course are you
[1:45:00] with me you've been letting loose some
[1:45:03] summer semesters eh yeah I can feel them
[1:45:07] I can feel that you're throwing mustard
[1:45:09] seeds to the mountain but let a win get
[1:45:12] behind it let them win get behind that
[1:45:15] grain of mustard seed and watch what
[1:45:17] it'll do
[1:45:19] window change your course you can
[1:45:23] imagine this if you're out running
[1:45:24] jogging for your exercise yeah I know
[1:45:32] yeah I know it's a tough subject here
[1:45:35] but we'll get over it you're on it you
[1:45:40] can imagine you're running out in the
[1:45:41] wind
[1:45:42] maybe it give you a better illustration
[1:45:43] so you ain't gotta think about running
[1:45:45] but you look out you can look at all the
[1:45:47] weatherman fails and that's standing out
[1:45:51] pairing that gale-force winds and
[1:45:52] they're trying to act like it's blowing
[1:45:54] them back and forth and you got people
[1:45:56] walking behind them it's just walking
[1:45:57] normal but you can really imagine if
[1:46:02] you're sitting there in that 120 mile
[1:46:05] blowing against you and he's pushing you
[1:46:08] and you're struggling just to move
[1:46:11] forward you see it's a wind that it'll
[1:46:14] make you change your course and turn
[1:46:16] around and start going the other way
[1:46:17] well I got good news for you that same
[1:46:21] wind of the Holy Ghost is making safe
[1:46:23] can change his course and make him turn
[1:46:26] around and run for cover
[1:46:31] it's pushed it against the enemy the
[1:46:34] wind will change its course you look at
[1:46:38] the wind and you see the effects of it
[1:46:40] but you don't see the land you don't
[1:46:43] know where it comes from but it's there
[1:46:46] you look at the leaves and as they're
[1:46:49] clapping when the wind goes across them
[1:46:51] but you don't see the wind you see the
[1:46:53] trees battling but you don't see the
[1:46:55] wind you see i last things are moving
[1:46:59] because of the wind but you don't see
[1:47:00] the wind there are things that are
[1:47:02] happening just now that you are
[1:47:05] realizing the effect of it but you don't
[1:47:08] see the spirit the Holy Ghost is here is
[1:47:11] moving and in shaping people's lives by
[1:47:14] the word of power maybe you don't see it

[1:47:26] no man can do these things except he be
[1:47:28] from God you don't see it but the winds
[1:47:32] there you may not sense it but the
[1:47:36] operation of the Holy Spirit said man
[1:47:40] can create this man can't do this but
[1:47:45] God can there's been things that are
[1:47:49] sitting here in this church that you've
[1:47:52] been praying about and the Spirit of the
[1:47:54] Lord moved to porn you didn't see him
[1:47:57] working but he was working you didn't
[1:48:00] see him moving but he was moving I'd say
[1:48:05] that there was a shift after Melchizedek
[1:48:07] came after milk Ezzor that came and
[1:48:10] Abraham is Harry say Hillary they looked
[1:48:13] at they looked at milk esident and all
[1:48:16] of a sudden there became a shift over
[1:48:19] their body and it brought their body
[1:48:21] into a spot of subjection where the
[1:48:23] water could come forth there was a word
[1:48:26] hanging over top of them that had to
[1:48:28] come forth
[1:48:29] they didn't see maybe when they went to
[1:48:31] bed that night but when they woke up the
[1:48:34] next morning they seen the effect of
[1:48:36] milk as a net the charts wort ain't been
[1:48:39] able to look at it but you have been
[1:48:41] able than my place and by access to look
[1:48:44] at the effects of melchizedek you watch
[1:48:50] the effects of the wind of the Holy
[1:48:52] Ghost when men that were once sinful
[1:48:55] become holy they're thoughtlessly become
[1:48:57] serious evil become pure fish has become
[1:49:01] moral moral become religious prayer has
[1:49:06] become prayerful rebellious and stubborn
[1:49:09] become meek mild and gentle no man could
[1:49:13] do that somebody may influence you to be
[1:49:17] on a better diet than the crispy dream
[1:49:19] died let yourself drive around it as a
[1:49:24] pastor would say 13 times and you'll be
[1:49:28] influenced together are you with me
[1:49:32] you see man can influence and maybe
[1:49:35] affect you in a sense but no man can
[1:49:38] change you but God you see because Peter
[1:49:41] would walk with the Lord he would become
[1:49:43] influenced by the Lord he B would walk
[1:49:46] with him and he would he would do the
[1:49:48] things of God he would see the things of
[1:49:49] God and Peter would give up his business
[1:49:53] efficient he would walk with Jesus he
[1:49:56] walked closer than anybody could imagine
[1:49:59] he was influenced by him he went out and
[1:50:02] did and preached but when Jesus died
[1:50:05] what did Peter do he went back to his
[1:50:07] old business again Peter had enough he
[1:50:14] had enough fight for you and I rely he
[1:50:16] had a no fight for a whole whole
[1:50:18] apostles he was still influenced by that
[1:50:22] first nature but when he was up there in
[1:50:25] the upper room
[1:50:27] they began to be a wind of change and
[1:50:31] begin to change his circumstance to
[1:50:33] change how he viewed everything he
[1:50:35] didn't just turn a new leaf
[1:50:36] he became a new creation in Christ he
[1:50:40] was afraid to come out of the Upper Room
[1:50:42] there he was afraid to speak but when
[1:50:45] the day of Pentecost was fully come and
[1:50:48] they were there all in one Accord he
[1:50:51] come out of that Upper Room shall he
[1:50:54] come out of that Upper Room dance and he
[1:50:56] came out of that upper room praising God
[1:50:58] and speaking with the heavenly language
[1:51:02] I'd say that he was influenced by an
[1:51:05] angel he come out speaking this as that
[1:51:09] which was prophesied by the Prophet Joel
[1:51:14] brother Branham said in blasphemous
[1:51:16] names he said the church is the mystical
[1:51:19] body of Christ born of the breath of God
[1:51:21] he said or did you get it born of the
[1:51:25] breath of God God breathed breathed into
[1:51:28] the nostrils spiritually of Adam and it
[1:51:30] became a living soul did you know that
[1:51:32] the Pentecost or the true Pentecostal
[1:51:34] church is born of the breath of God John
[1:51:39] says in John the Bible says in John
[1:51:41] chapter 20 said unto them peace be unto
[1:51:44] you
[1:51:48] me even so I sinned you and when he had
[1:51:56] said he briefed on them they saith unto
[1:52:01] them receive ye the Holy Ghost you see
[1:52:06] this was a promise that he gave them
[1:52:09] that he breathed on them the promise and
[1:52:12] said receive ye the Holy Ghost it was a
[1:52:14] promise but they went up there in the
[1:52:17] upper room to wait for the promise to be
[1:52:19] fulfilled there's a promise hanging over
[1:52:22] you just like the same thing is when we
[1:52:25] lay hands on the sick lay heads upon you
[1:52:28] to be healed then you go to this and
[1:52:31] you're waiting for the promise to be
[1:52:32] fulfilled you may not feel you may not
[1:52:38] feel any different but the winds of
[1:52:41] change are moving over your body you
[1:52:47] remember when the Prophet was just a
[1:52:50] little child and it was there and it
[1:52:53] became awareness that totally set his
[1:52:55] course you remember how that whirlwind
[1:52:58] was caught in that tree and he was he
[1:53:00] was walking down there carrying that
[1:53:02] bucket of water you remember and he
[1:53:04] stood there and that wind span there and
[1:53:06] a voice spoke out of that wind and he
[1:53:08] told him don't ever smoke or drink or
[1:53:10] defy your body for there's a word for
[1:53:12] you to do some people I tend to put that
[1:53:14] on the prophet that's you don't defy
[1:53:17] your body
[1:53:18] don't take a strong drink don't smoke
[1:53:21] don't defy your body don't tak to
[1:53:24] yourself for the things of the world you
[1:53:26] got a lot to do there's a voice behind
[1:53:30] this wind that's correct in the air you
[1:53:37] remember when brother Branham was
[1:53:39] standing there in 1950 and he's standing
[1:53:42] there to Houston policy and there in
[1:53:44] Houston Texas and he's standing there
[1:53:46] and there's a debate between on divine
[1:53:49] healing between doctor best and brother
[1:53:51] Bosworth and he's there and all of these
[1:53:54] things are going over and you know the
[1:53:55] story and brother Branham was sitting at
[1:53:58] the top of the balcony
[1:53:59] the Bosworth said now I know but the
[1:54:01] bills here in the building and he said
[1:54:03] I'm ace and now whether he wants to come
[1:54:05] or not that's up to him but he said I
[1:54:07] know he's in the building somewhere and
[1:54:09] he said if he would like to come and
[1:54:10] close in a word of prayer or say a few
[1:54:13] things he can come and make his way this
[1:54:15] way and his brother Howard was sitting
[1:54:17] there and he said Bo don't move he said
[1:54:20] I'm not moving he said Ben all of a
[1:54:22] sudden they're beginning to be a wind
[1:54:23] over top of him and a word and he stood
[1:54:26] up they said let's stand he said I stood
[1:54:29] up and Howard said Beale sit down he
[1:54:31] said Howard he's spoken brother Branham
[1:54:35] walks down me walks down the aisle that
[1:54:38] is set in a course and angels are
[1:54:41] guarding that aisle as the Prophet is
[1:54:43] making his way to the stage and brother
[1:54:46] Branham takes the platform and he starts
[1:54:48] speaking to those thousands of people
[1:54:50] and he says I'm sorry that these things
[1:54:53] have to be I'm sorry that these things
[1:54:56] have to be like this and all of a sudden
[1:54:58] there came a whirl again and a wind over
[1:55:02] top of brother Branham and he said he
[1:55:04] has spoken he has spoken and all of a
[1:55:07] sudden the photographer that was sitting
[1:55:09] there snapped a picture and it proved to
[1:55:13] you that this message is vindicated none
[1:55:16] other than by our Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:55:20] have seen that same vilify come in this
[1:55:24] building
[1:55:24] how many church services and influence
[1:55:27] of people to believe for their
[1:55:30] Possible's hallelujah the vision don't
[1:55:38] make you whole the vision tells you that
[1:55:41] there's a God here

[1:55:57] of you and change your situation we've
[1:56:02] been sitting there long enough in that
[1:56:03] condition you've been sitting there

[1:56:29] break a tree what about your nature when
[1:56:31] the Holy Ghost comes across you are you
[1:56:37] with me

[2:01:23] is in the world he's greater than cancer
[2:01:27] he's greater than torment he's greater

[2:06:01] place he put her in a homeland but
[2:06:04] national force they putting a bride in

[2:06:13] same power of authority it's putting
[2:06:15] herself in her position as the bride of

[2:06:28] looked like he was just another little
[2:06:30] boy he look like he was just another boy
[2:06:33] but I'd say that David was swinging in

[2:06:38] force that collide to fill the wind off
[2:06:40] her I want you to hear me Goliath of

[2:10:36] time again but every single time I get
[2:10:39] here your faith is stronger your poll is
[2:10:41] stronger why is it
[2:10:43] it is testifying to me that there's our
[2:10:46] people that's ready they're ready for
[2:10:49] the word and due season and the wind of
[2:10:52] the Holy Ghost ain't just working on me

[2:10:55] ready it's a time like never before for
[2:11:01] the wind to get behind our face and to
[2:11:03] push our faith in there's such a spot
[2:11:05] that will look over top of these
[2:11:06] buzzards and we'll start knocking these
[2:11:08] buzzards on top of the head and we'll
[2:11:10] say go down through the demons of hell

[2:11:53] willing to accept another cycle I'm not
[2:11:58] willing to lose I'm not willing to lose
