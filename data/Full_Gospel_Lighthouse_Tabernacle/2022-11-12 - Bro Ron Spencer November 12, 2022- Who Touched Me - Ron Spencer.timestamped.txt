[44:14] and
[44:15] doctors had done all that they could do

[44:38] and you don't really realize it's
[44:40] happened until you've already been
[44:41] through it and now you know it's
[44:43] happened so
[44:45] and so he called me today and said her

[46:48] a lord Jesus
[46:50] we don't come to touch a man tonight we
[46:53] come to touch you
[46:56] and we realize that we could we can only
[46:58] get past our senses and get into that
[47:01] sixth sense of faith
[47:03] it'll move mountains
[47:06] and we'll speak to things that seem
[47:09] impossible
[47:10] but God you're more than
[47:13] a miracle worker we ask you now that
[47:17] you'd send your word to all the ones
[47:20] that are sick
[47:22] and have great needs

[47:26] them tonight
[47:28] May the healing Angel go by their way

[47:33] you have done but we still need to
[47:36] preach that you're a Healer
[47:38] you're a Waymaker
[47:40] I asked you tonight that you would
[47:42] anoint our lips as we'd stand in this
[47:44] Pulpit one more time

[47:49] journey

[47:58] Luke chapter 8 and verse 43. amen amen
[48:03] we certainly love you
[48:05] Luke chapter 8 and verse 43 and then
[48:08] we'll go to Luke chapter 7 and verse 39.
[48:11] I want to speak to to you tonight on
[48:16] who touched me
[48:19] I think it's kind of a fitting sermon
[48:22] for where we're at but it was lined up
[48:25] in the
[48:26] in the lineup and so here we are and
[48:29] you know I believe we can touch him
[48:31] tonight
[48:32] amen
[48:35] and a woman having an issue of blood
[48:39] 12 years
[48:40] think about the things that she had
[48:43] spent
[48:45] which spent all her living upon
[48:49] Physicians
[48:51] neither could be healed of any
[48:56] came behind him
[48:58] and touched the border of His Garment
[49:03] and immediately
[49:05] her issue of blood staunched
[49:10] and Jesus said
[49:12] who touched me
[49:15] when all denied Peter and they that were
[49:18] with him said Master the multitude
[49:21] thrown thee
[49:22] and press thee and sayest thou who touch
[49:27] me
[49:28] and Jesus said
[49:30] somebody hath touched me for I perceive
[49:35] that virtue is gone out of me
[49:38] and when the woman saw that she was not
[49:41] hid she came trembling and falling down
[49:45] before him she declared unto him before
[49:47] all the people
[49:49] for what cause she had touched him
[49:52] and how she was healed immediately
[49:55] and he said unto her
[49:58] daughter
[50:00] be of good courage
[50:02] thy faith hath made thee whole
[50:06] go in peace
[50:09] there wasn't a rabbi
[50:11] in all of Jerusalem
[50:13] that could have done that
[50:17] so we make that declaration Luke chapter
[50:20] 7 and verse 39. now when the Pharisees
[50:25] which had been bitten him saw it he
[50:29] spake within himself saying this man if
[50:32] he were a prophet
[50:34] would have known who and what manner of
[50:37] a woman that it is that touched him
[50:40] for she is a sinner
[50:42] and Jesus sawing
[50:45] Jesus answering said unto him Simon I
[50:49] have somewhat to say unto thee
[50:52] and he said Master say on
[50:56] there was a certain creditor which had
[50:58] two debtors one owed 500 Pence and the
[51:02] other 50.
[51:03] and when they had nothing to pay he
[51:07] frankly forgave them both
[51:10] tell me therefore which
[51:13] will love him the most and Simon
[51:16] answered and said I suppose that he to
[51:18] whom he forgave most
[51:21] and he said unto him thou has rightly
[51:24] judged
[51:25] and he turned to the woman and said to
[51:28] and said unto Simon seeest thou this
[51:31] woman
[51:32] I entered into thine house
[51:35] and thou gave us me no water for my feet
[51:38] but she hath washed my feet with tears
[51:43] and wiped them with the hairs of her
[51:46] head
[51:47] thou gave us me no kiss
[51:50] but this woman since the time that I
[51:53] came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet
[51:57] my head and my all thou didst not anoint
[52:02] but this woman hath anointed my feet
[52:06] with ointment
[52:09] wherefore I say unto thee her sins
[52:13] which are many
[52:15] are forgiven
[52:17] for she loved much for to whom little is
[52:22] Forgiven the same loveth little
[52:25] and he said unto her
[52:28] thy sins are forgiven
[52:36] I like that don't you
[52:39] amen you can be seated
[52:47] so many times we want to come to church
[52:50] and we have expectations
[52:54] if we could just think about it if there
[52:58] was a throng of people that was around
[52:59] Jesus
[53:01] it heard of Miracles they'd seen signs
[53:04] in Wonder take place
[53:06] but if they could only get into a space
[53:08] with him
[53:10] if they could just get him to look their
[53:12] way just for a moment
[53:14] maybe their needs would get met
[53:19] no doubt on this day that the woman is
[53:22] pressing her way you remember this is
[53:24] the same Journey that Jarius is going to
[53:26] be on and his daughter is dead before
[53:29] they can get to the house
[53:31] but Jesus would tell him fear not
[53:34] but remember it is on this journey to
[53:37] this house it's a walk and there's a
[53:39] throng to people around them and they're
[53:41] pressing their way and and no doubt many
[53:44] touch Jesus
[53:46] but they didn't get healed
[53:49] but she came in an atmosphere
[53:53] she came in an atmosphere if I could
[53:55] only Touch the Hem of His Garment I
[53:58] don't need him to pray for me I don't
[54:00] need him to speak to me but if I can
[54:02] only get him to Touch the Hem of His
[54:04] garments and notice the desperation this
[54:07] was the end of end all the ends
[54:10] if she don't get healed in this this
[54:12] particular meeting she's not going to
[54:15] make it
[54:16] I think of how many times that brother
[54:19] Branham would go and he would he would
[54:22] come to the pulpit late and he would
[54:23] apologize coming to the pulpit late and
[54:26] he said but I've been outside I've been
[54:28] outside praying and in the ambulances
[54:30] and and step up in the ambulances and
[54:34] people would travel from great distances
[54:37] and they would they would literally die
[54:40] on their way
[54:42] many are would die on their way to the
[54:45] to the tent meetings but they knew if
[54:47] they could only get there
[54:52] these doctors are that you know we all
[54:54] believe in doctors but but you know they
[54:57] they they came to the end of their
[54:58] resources
[55:01] you know they're now Reckoning you to
[55:03] another hospital into another Doctrine
[55:05] to another doctor because they're
[55:07] Limited in their factions and they're
[55:10] Limited in their knowledge
[55:12] are you with me
[55:14] are you with me and so and so anyway
[55:16] this this
[55:18] as they would come and brother Branham
[55:21] would step up in and and and they would
[55:23] step up in and many of those people were
[55:25] raised back to life you'll never hear of
[55:28] but they came of desperation
[55:31] if I die on the way
[55:36] if I die on the way
[55:39] and he would step up and pray for them
[55:47] brother Ronnie McCann shared he just
[55:49] passed away just a few weeks ago
[55:53] he's a precious man
[55:57] I knew him since I was a young boy
[56:01] and he said I went to the meetings
[56:04] he said we were we were young people
[56:08] me and my wife and we knew we couldn't
[56:10] get in
[56:11] but we would stand outside the meetings
[56:14] and hold hands
[56:16] and stand in that awesome presence
[56:20] and he said it was worth it just going
[56:22] and standing in that awesome presence he
[56:25] said and it changed my life forever
[56:29] it wasn't that he touched the speaker
[56:33] or he got to shake brother branham's
[56:35] hand
[56:36] but he but he got to feel the same God
[56:41] that the woman that touched the Hem of
[56:44] the Garment
[56:45] and from that point till the day he died
[56:48] he was a Believer it was a pillar in the
[56:53] churches that he was a part of
[56:56] I would like to say this to you our
[56:58] expectation should be the same
[57:01] yeah
[57:02] our expectations should be the same what
[57:06] will we get out of this service what
[57:08] will the service do for me
[57:11] I'll never forget and I just want to
[57:13] relay this in a personal way I remember
[57:15] preaching here maybe a year and a half
[57:18] ago and as I spoke and I talked to you
[57:21] about the ambulances and how that even
[57:24] in one's instance they traveled 17 hours
[57:27] in an ambulance to get there died on the
[57:30] way and then they were raised back to
[57:32] life
[57:34] and while I was preaching and that just
[57:37] kind of quickened and I felt the
[57:38] presence of the Lord hit me at that
[57:40] point I was so weak I could hardly speak
[57:44] I was so weak I could I was having a
[57:47] hard time I hadn't worked with the boy
[57:49] since the cancer diagnosis and I was
[57:52] having a difficult time with chemo and I
[57:54] went home that night and I was laying in
[57:56] the bed and about the middle of the
[57:58] night it struck me
[58:00] 17 hours away
[58:05] and I told the boys the next morning
[58:08] Tim Pruitt is 17 hours away I don't know
[58:10] what's going to happen I don't expect
[58:12] lightning
[58:15] but I'm going to have a step of Faith
[58:17] we're not going to tell doctors we're
[58:19] going to get in a car
[58:22] are you with me and it was it was Adam
[58:25] and Alden and Andrew drove me there took
[58:28] turns driving me there when we got there
[58:31] brother Tim was brother Tim was fishing
[58:33] on the on on the bank of the and he was
[58:36] just fishing and I walked down there and
[58:38] how did Dallas Cowboys hat on and we I
[58:42] walked down and I gave him a hug and and
[58:45] you know we just fell a ship for a
[58:46] little while that night
[58:49] we begin to have prayer I never felt
[58:52] lightning
[58:54] I never felt thunder I never felt no
[58:57] unction Adam received the Holy Ghost to
[59:00] a brother Tim Prince boys received the
[59:03] Holy Ghost I really never felt nothing
[59:05] but I acted on faith
[59:08] [Applause]
[59:10] when I came home I never missed another
[59:12] day of work
[59:14] [Applause]
[59:16] you tell me that's not God
[59:19] [Music]
[59:26] it's not that you're touching a man
[59:30] not that some special preacher preaches
[59:33] for speaks to you
[59:35] we can have confidence in men
[59:38] but the confidence is in the gift of
[59:40] Christ that's inside of the man
[59:44] as we would see it on display brother
[59:46] Brandon would turn his back
[59:48] to the audience to show us the same
[59:51] Melchizedek sign
[59:53] that was showed with Abraham
[59:56] and Sarah to where that revealed the
[1:00:00] secrets of the hearts
[1:00:04] brother
[1:00:06] Brady stood in this Pulpit on his last
[1:00:10] service
[1:00:12] he turned his back to the audience
[1:00:15] and he said there was 14 different he
[1:00:18] said I counted it 14 different cases
[1:00:21] that brother Branham called out with his
[1:00:23] back told them where they were sitting
[1:00:25] in the building called their names their
[1:00:28] address their condition
[1:00:30] had he been wrong in any little iota
[1:00:35] people would have never believed but it
[1:00:38] was more than a man
[1:00:40] [Applause]
[1:00:44] are you with me now
[1:00:46] we had a sign of the end
[1:00:53] that was displayed before us the mighty
[1:00:56] Angel was Among Us
[1:00:59] and God was displaying it Revelations
[1:01:03] 10. holding your life in his hand the
[1:01:07] book of redemption and he opened that
[1:01:09] book as the proof of his resurrection
[1:01:14] and now we get to handle the word of
[1:01:17] life
[1:01:19] now I want to say this to you when Eve
[1:01:22] and Adam fell because he fell first
[1:01:27] Adam
[1:01:29] fell with his eyes wide open
[1:01:32] as an act of redemption to reclaim her
[1:01:36] because listen God would have killed her
[1:01:39] she was commanded don't you touch that
[1:01:42] don't you touch that tree of Good and
[1:01:44] Evil
[1:01:46] are you with me but her touching the
[1:01:48] tree of Good and Evil caused her to not
[1:01:51] have access to the Tree of Life
[1:01:55] but God would have killed her
[1:01:59] but being a type of God himself he took
[1:02:03] Eve to himself and placed his seed on
[1:02:06] the inside of her
[1:02:09] and God commanded them to leave the
[1:02:11] garden and denied them access to be able
[1:02:15] to touch the tree of life again
[1:02:18] [Applause]
[1:02:20] oh how it must have been a testimony for
[1:02:23] that 900 years of what it was like to be
[1:02:26] in the Garden of Eden what it was like
[1:02:29] to walk in the pool of the evening and
[1:02:32] have fellowship with almighty God
[1:02:35] what it was like to move mountains
[1:02:37] Wellness light to speak to the animals
[1:02:40] and everything was perfect
[1:02:43] you could have fellowship with God you
[1:02:46] could touch God
[1:02:50] but sin took us across the chasm and we
[1:02:55] couldn't touch God
[1:02:58] yeah
[1:02:59] that's it yes it did he would fellowship
[1:03:01] with enough men all the way down to a
[1:03:03] man at the end of the stage of the
[1:03:05] journey
[1:03:06] the man named Enoch
[1:03:09] an Enoch would begin to write about what
[1:03:11] was written into heavens
[1:03:13] and he would write a pyramid on the
[1:03:16] Earth
[1:03:17] perfect
[1:03:19] and scientists of the world still can't
[1:03:21] figure out how you can build a pyramid
[1:03:23] so perfect
[1:03:25] because God was writing his Bible
[1:03:28] through a prophet Enoch
[1:03:30] that's a pyramid on the Earth
[1:03:33] and if you remember in in the heavens
[1:03:36] and in the pyramid he writes that
[1:03:38] there's enmity between the seed and he
[1:03:41] writes I will be your Redeemer
[1:03:45] no Prophet can do that
[1:03:57] Adam and Eve in their fallen condition
[1:04:01] couldn't touch the Tree of Life
[1:04:04] let me just say this to you
[1:04:06] when God came down to Moses on the
[1:04:08] mountain
[1:04:10] brother Shannon you remember what he
[1:04:12] told them
[1:04:13] said don't know no one put their hand on
[1:04:15] the mountain
[1:04:17] because God was such a holy God
[1:04:19] if a beast would put their their foot on
[1:04:24] the mountain it would die
[1:04:28] to walk unworthy into the holies of holy
[1:04:31] they would die
[1:04:33] they literally would put a rope on their
[1:04:35] on their foot
[1:04:38] and if they had a blemish in their life
[1:04:42] they pull them out because God's a holy
[1:04:44] God
[1:04:50] I was in a I was in a lawyer a famous
[1:04:52] lawyer's office
[1:04:55] for a friend of mine
[1:04:58] and
[1:05:00] and we were there to
[1:05:02] they had arrested a friend of mine and
[1:05:05] this is a long time ago
[1:05:09] and I had called them it was on a Sunday
[1:05:11] evening and
[1:05:13] and I called them I said will you take
[1:05:15] his case and say well this is what we we
[1:05:18] expect
[1:05:19] to get and I said well he can he can
[1:05:22] afford it
[1:05:23] and so anyway
[1:05:26] the wife was sitting sitting there with
[1:05:28] me before I would go in and talk to the
[1:05:30] to the man himself and she said you know
[1:05:33] she said I want my husband as my lawyer
[1:05:36] when I stand at the Throne of judgment
[1:05:39] and I looked at him and I said well
[1:05:41] that's one case
[1:05:42] he'll lose
[1:05:47] and I said there's only one lawyer
[1:05:50] that you want there
[1:05:56] you say brother on I'll stand there
[1:06:01] and everything to say
[1:06:03] they're only God will be doing the
[1:06:05] talking
[1:06:06] [Applause]
[1:06:14] uh
[1:06:17] so
[1:06:19] so
[1:06:21] if you can just imagine just for a
[1:06:23] moment
[1:06:25] you could imagine just for a moment that
[1:06:30] that we needed a redeemer
[1:06:33] and God condescended down through every
[1:06:36] prophet
[1:06:37] now in every prophet
[1:06:40] there was always a little bit of
[1:06:41] confusion
[1:06:43] you could see man
[1:06:47] but you could see God
[1:06:52] you could see Moses
[1:06:54] but there was times you could see God
[1:06:59] you could see Daniel
[1:07:02] but there was times you could see God
[1:07:04] you could see Elijah
[1:07:07] but there was times you could see God
[1:07:11] now brother Ron you're just way off
[1:07:12] Moses with a high temper
[1:07:17] Moses was a murderer
[1:07:20] are you with me
[1:07:22] he had us he had a sheet
[1:07:26] of wrongs
[1:07:28] even the scripture Bears out a
[1:07:30] high-tempered life
[1:07:32] imagine that on the backside of a desert
[1:07:37] even Joseph
[1:07:39] when it came down to a critical moment
[1:07:41] lied and he was a perfect type of Jesus
[1:07:44] Christ
[1:07:46] these men were displaying attributes of
[1:07:50] almighty God
[1:07:54] are you with me
[1:07:56] but like us today we can't heal you
[1:08:02] we can't give you revelation
[1:08:06] we can't save you
[1:08:09] but we can preach you into an atmosphere
[1:08:11] of one who can
[1:08:14] one who can heal you one who can save
[1:08:17] you one who can deliver you
[1:08:25] Hallelujah
[1:08:26] [Applause]
[1:08:28] there's a reason that we can do that is
[1:08:30] because we met him
[1:08:32] more than some intellectual gospel more
[1:08:36] than some computer thoughts put together
[1:08:40] are you more more than a Reformation
[1:08:42] we're not here to reform and we're not
[1:08:44] here to rehab we're here to transform
[1:08:52] are you with me
[1:08:55] foreign
[1:09:00] you call me
[1:09:03] Sister Barbara it's been several years
[1:09:05] ago now
[1:09:07] and Tabitha had been sick
[1:09:11] and was getting worse and worse and
[1:09:12] worse and worse and I was studying
[1:09:15] for a sermon
[1:09:18] and I think you guys were having cookie
[1:09:20] exchange if I'm right
[1:09:23] and she called me
[1:09:26] and so
[1:09:28] and when she called me she said
[1:09:30] Tabitha's right nigh unto death
[1:09:34] and they're just giving her hours to
[1:09:36] live
[1:09:38] and I I told her I said well I'll pray
[1:09:41] because that's you know that's what we
[1:09:43] can do that's the best thing we can do
[1:09:45] is I'll pray
[1:09:47] my computer was on my lap about my heads
[1:09:50] and prayed
[1:09:51] and a voice spoke
[1:09:54] and said go to her bed
[1:09:57] was an hour away
[1:09:59] I called her back and I said I'll go
[1:10:02] the Lord told me
[1:10:05] so I got myself together and I drove
[1:10:07] there
[1:10:09] for the most of you you know this story
[1:10:12] and I said I'll go
[1:10:14] it was getting now late
[1:10:17] and I I walked I walked down the hall I
[1:10:20] walked into the room there's a nurse
[1:10:21] there their daughters there her husband
[1:10:24] was sitting on the little we sat down we
[1:10:26] talked and they were checking her signs
[1:10:28] and they were different things and
[1:10:31] her husband and I I had conversation we
[1:10:34] talked for quite a while and he talked
[1:10:36] about insurance he talked about the job
[1:10:38] he talked about funeral plans he talked
[1:10:41] about a lot of things he talked about a
[1:10:42] half an hour I just let him talk
[1:10:45] because I felt like I really didn't know
[1:10:46] what was going to happen
[1:10:56] and I said well I'll just have to say
[1:10:58] this to you
[1:10:59] I don't think that God sent me here to
[1:11:02] talk to you about funeral plans
[1:11:08] I don't I don't think so
[1:11:13] this is just one time really
[1:11:17] brother Homer and I walked into a room
[1:11:19] of people we didn't even know
[1:11:21] their son had been Twisted in an
[1:11:23] accident and literally I'd never seen
[1:11:26] anybody twisted like that his body was
[1:11:29] contorted
[1:11:31] he was contorted in a lot of different
[1:11:32] directions we were instructed not to
[1:11:36] DARE lay a hand on him
[1:11:38] the parents couldn't touch him
[1:11:41] and the doctor stood
[1:11:44] and said don't touch it
[1:11:47] we prayed
[1:11:48] when that boy woke up the next morning
[1:11:51] his body was perfect
[1:11:54] and this is what he said
[1:11:57] two angels walked into the room last
[1:11:59] night Mom and Dad did y'all see them
[1:12:02] walk in
[1:12:06] and I felt the catch
[1:12:13] no man can do that
[1:12:16] no man can do that I could stand here
[1:12:19] for the rest of this evening and tell
[1:12:21] you Miracle after Miracle after Miracle
[1:12:24] brother Homer went in and prayed for
[1:12:26] brother Abby one time in the VA
[1:12:28] and there was a there was a man that was
[1:12:31] laying uh beside at the next bed and his
[1:12:35] sisters
[1:12:36] said we we will you pray for him too
[1:12:40] she said yeah I said the preacher's here

[1:12:44] you're going to get well and brother
[1:12:46] Homer ladies hands on and prayed for him

[1:12:54] the man was gone brother Abby said well
[1:12:57] he said well did he die he said oh no
[1:12:59] said said the next day he got up he got
[1:13:02] out of the bed and left went home he's
[1:13:03] well
[1:13:11] I'll never forget she weighed about 85
[1:13:14] pounds
[1:13:17] she was Green
[1:13:19] I'd never seen a person that green
[1:13:23] foreign
[1:13:25] I held her I just took her head
[1:13:28] and her eyes was rolled back
[1:13:32] and they told me quickly
[1:13:35] that she hadn't spoke for a while
[1:13:38] and I called her name and her eyes
[1:13:40] rolled right down to me
[1:13:42] and I said Tabitha
[1:13:49] and I'll tell you what I told her I'm
[1:13:50] going to be very honest with you
[1:13:52] I told her I said you haven't always
[1:13:53] agreed with me
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:57] but I'm here
[1:13:59] I'm here for you
[1:14:02] and I want you to know Jesus is here for
[1:14:04] you
[1:14:06] and I told her exactly
[1:14:08] what had happened Sister Barbara
[1:14:12] made the call for you for me to come and
[1:14:15] I would pray for you at home and then
[1:14:17] God would speak to me to come and pray
[1:14:19] for you
[1:14:21] and I'm sitting here now and I don't
[1:14:23] believe that I'm just here for you to
[1:14:26] die
[1:14:27] yeah
[1:14:29] and I prayed
[1:14:31] listen we as Believers have power and
[1:14:34] authority with prayer
[1:14:37] we're not touching some Pope's chair
[1:14:39] we're not kissing some statue we're not
[1:14:43] rubbing some beads
[1:14:46] we're not rubbing across
[1:14:54] we gotta live in God
[1:14:56] that conquered death Helen the grave he
[1:15:00] went to hell so I wouldn't have to go to
[1:15:02] hell he raised up on the third day so
[1:15:06] that when I die he can raise me up
[1:15:09] no matter what condition that I would be
[1:15:12] in
[1:15:14] he took Stripes at College judgment Hall
[1:15:17] and did not call thousands of angels to
[1:15:20] set him free so we could be healed
[1:15:24] [Applause]
[1:15:36] I turned around
[1:15:39] to her husband
[1:15:41] and I I said she'll walk down the hall
[1:15:44] with you tomorrow
[1:15:47] correct
[1:15:51] not die in a couple of hours
[1:15:58] she'll walk down the hall with you
[1:16:00] tomorrow
[1:16:05] they called me and said she did
[1:16:08] the nurse told me said Mr Spencer
[1:16:12] do you do you realize the conditions
[1:16:14] she's in
[1:16:15] and you just said she would walk down
[1:16:17] the hall tomorrow she's going to die in
[1:16:19] a couple hours
[1:16:21] and here's my words to her
[1:16:24] I didn't say it
[1:16:31] [Applause]
[1:16:40] she actually became a nurse
[1:16:43] and took care of our brother Homer
[1:16:47] you're talking about a real full circle
[1:16:51] God's really neat in how he operates
[1:16:53] isn't he
[1:16:59] Jesus would say
[1:17:03] no man
[1:17:05] takes my life
[1:17:10] I lay it down
[1:17:15] I take it up again
[1:17:17] it wasn't up to caiaphasis
[1:17:21] it wasn't up to Pilate
[1:17:24] it wasn't up to soldiers
[1:17:31] listen let me just say this to you so
[1:17:33] many times you hear people say Abraham
[1:17:35] had to chase Isaac down
[1:17:38] so that he could put him on the
[1:17:40] sacrifice he was willing
[1:17:44] Jesus was willing to drink the bitter
[1:17:47] cop
[1:17:50] remember he he actually died at the
[1:17:53] Garden of Gethsemane
[1:17:55] father
[1:17:57] left this cup passed from me
[1:18:01] not my will but thy will be done
[1:18:09] notice some scriptures before I go too
[1:18:11] far Colossians chapter 1 and 19 for it
[1:18:15] pleased the father
[1:18:18] that in him should all fullness dwell
[1:18:21] and having made peace through the blood
[1:18:23] of his cross for him to reconcile all
[1:18:27] things to himself by him I say whether
[1:18:30] they be things in Earth
[1:18:32] are things in heaven
[1:18:34] now notice he's going to bring you into
[1:18:36] this
[1:18:39] and you
[1:18:42] that were sometimes alienated
[1:18:46] and enemies in your own minds by Wicked
[1:18:49] works
[1:18:51] yet now hath he reconciled
[1:18:56] God knew where he was at
[1:19:02] you looked unsavable
[1:19:04] you walked unsaveable you talked
[1:19:08] unsavable
[1:19:09] but God rich in Mercy
[1:19:12] you would be an aliens from the kingdom
[1:19:14] of God
[1:19:17] called you before the foundation of the
[1:19:20] world
[1:19:23] ever get a chance Joel's got a testimony
[1:19:26] he was just wondering something was
[1:19:28] thirsting in his life and he was just
[1:19:31] wondering just looking he said I wanted
[1:19:33] to live off of the grid
[1:19:35] something was pulling on the inside of
[1:19:37] him
[1:19:42] something got to pulling on the inside
[1:19:44] of you
[1:19:45] because you wasn't looking for God God
[1:19:48] came looking for you
[1:20:00] yet now hath he reconciled
[1:20:03] in the body of his flesh through death
[1:20:07] to present you
[1:20:10] you were filthy but watch what he did
[1:20:12] for you Anna to present you holy
[1:20:17] unblameable
[1:20:19] an unreprovable
[1:20:22] notice these next three words in his
[1:20:25] sight
[1:20:29] now the one that wouldn't let Adam and
[1:20:31] Eve back in the garden to touch him or
[1:20:33] let any animal or let any any man touch
[1:20:37] the touch the mountain
[1:20:39] or anybody walk into the holies of
[1:20:42] holies now you're holy
[1:20:47] unblameable
[1:20:49] unreprovable in his sight
[1:20:53] household by some school no by the blood
[1:20:57] of the Lamb
[1:21:00] [Music]
[1:21:04] Hebrews chapter 4 thank you I needed
[1:21:08] that
[1:21:09] Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 14 sin then
[1:21:12] that we have a great high priest
[1:21:20] foreign
[1:21:27] thank you that is passed into the
[1:21:30] heavens
[1:21:31] Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:21:34] let us hold fast our profession
[1:21:37] we have a great high priest
[1:21:41] for we have not noticed the word in here
[1:21:45] we have not a high priest
[1:21:48] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[1:21:51] of our infirmities
[1:21:56] too many high priests in in Israel
[1:21:59] it was just a job to them
[1:22:02] but we got a high priest
[1:22:05] [Music]
[1:22:07] whether you got money or you don't got
[1:22:10] money
[1:22:11] whether you're sick with a cold or
[1:22:14] you're dying with cancer
[1:22:16] we got a high priest that can be touched
[1:22:19] with the feeling of our infirmities
[1:22:24] but was in all points tempted
[1:22:28] like as we are yet without sin I want
[1:22:31] you to just notice because I want to tie
[1:22:33] into two weeks ago here right now yeah
[1:22:35] without sin don't you know you have the
[1:22:37] same accuser of the Brethren that is
[1:22:40] fighting you
[1:22:43] and Jesus could stand there and he was
[1:22:46] tempted in all like manners
[1:22:49] and our thoughts
[1:22:51] sound louder in Heavens than our words
[1:22:54] do on Earth
[1:22:56] and Jesus were tempted in an all-like
[1:22:59] matter
[1:23:00] and the accuser even his own enemy said
[1:23:03] I find no fault in him
[1:23:07] because the priest would take those
[1:23:09] lambs and turtle doves and they would
[1:23:11] look for if of it wasn't blemish on them
[1:23:16] they couldn't use it
[1:23:21] and if he's our savior
[1:23:24] and there's a blemish in it
[1:23:26] we're lost
[1:23:28] we sing the song Worthy is the Lamb
[1:23:33] no man in heaven
[1:23:35] no man in earth
[1:23:38] you know if we're not careful we'll lift
[1:23:39] one another up this or this or this we
[1:23:42] have right we have rights of respects
[1:23:45] and gifts are different
[1:23:47] and men are different there's private
[1:23:49] soldiers and there's generals
[1:23:51] you know anybody don't understand that
[1:23:53] that's just they don't understand
[1:23:56] you know there's orchestras but there's
[1:23:57] lead orchestras
[1:24:00] but let me just say Jesus was more than
[1:24:02] just one of the boys
[1:24:04] he was more than just one of the
[1:24:06] prophets
[1:24:09] [Music]
[1:24:11] listen he was God
[1:24:16] if he wasn't God
[1:24:18] then he was the greatest impersonator
[1:24:20] that ever lived
[1:24:23] he was both man and God
[1:24:29] Romans chapter 3 and verse 21 am I going
[1:24:32] okay are you are you catching what I'm
[1:24:35] saying but now in righteousness of God
[1:24:38] without law is manifest
[1:24:40] being Witnesses by the law and the
[1:24:43] prophets
[1:24:44] even the righteousness of God which is
[1:24:46] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all men
[1:24:50] and unto all them that believe for there
[1:24:52] is no difference
[1:24:54] notice these next words for all have
[1:24:58] sinned
[1:25:04] well brother Ron I never drank I never
[1:25:05] smoke I never did anything all have
[1:25:08] sinned
[1:25:09] the the guilt of all your forefathers
[1:25:12] came down to you
[1:25:14] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:25:17] glory of God being justified freely by
[1:25:20] his grace
[1:25:22] through Redemption that is in Christ
[1:25:24] Jesus how long does it take to break the
[1:25:28] chain of sin on your life seconds
[1:25:36] the woman that washed his feet never
[1:25:38] went back to that lifestyle again the
[1:25:41] woman at the well never went back to
[1:25:43] that lifestyle again
[1:25:46] are you with me
[1:25:48] just testimony all over this building
[1:25:50] many of you were wrecks of society but
[1:25:54] God rich in Mercy
[1:25:56] in just a few seconds God transformed
[1:25:59] your life no man can do that
[1:26:08] Romans chapter 8. there is therefore now
[1:26:11] no condemnation to them that which are
[1:26:13] in Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[1:26:16] flesh but after the spirit
[1:26:18] for the law of the spirit of Life of
[1:26:21] Christ Jesus hath made me free
[1:26:28] from the law of sin and death
[1:26:31] for what the law could not do
[1:26:35] in that it was weak
[1:26:38] through the flesh God's sinned in his
[1:26:41] own son in his likeness of sinful flesh
[1:26:44] for sin condemn sin in the flesh he
[1:26:50] conquered sin
[1:26:51] [Applause]
[1:26:56] thank you Lord
[1:26:58] First Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 9.
[1:27:02] know you not that the unrighteous shall
[1:27:04] not inherit
[1:27:05] the kingdom of God
[1:27:08] be not deceived neither fornicators nor
[1:27:10] adulterers nor idolaters
[1:27:13] nor feminine nor abusers of themselves

[1:27:19] drunkards or revitalers nor extorters

[1:27:37] Bitcoin this week
[1:27:44] I'll take my glasses off
[1:27:51] well
[1:27:54] I'm sure there's some people unhappy

[1:28:11] thinking
[1:28:16] and Andrew ain't even here
[1:28:21] he just described
[1:28:23] what's not going to be in heaven
[1:28:26] but notice he don't quit writing there
[1:28:29] and search
[1:28:32] read that next let's just read it
[1:28:34] together
[1:28:35] and since were some of you
[1:28:39] but ye are washed
[1:28:41] but ye are Sanctified but ye are
[1:28:44] justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:49] and by a spirit of our God
[1:28:54] [Applause]
[1:29:04] there was a little boy
[1:29:08] that was constantly getting muddy
[1:29:14] and his mama would give him sermons
[1:29:17] don't get in that mud hole no more
[1:29:23] she thought she gave him a good sermon
[1:29:25] and he had promised his life
[1:29:28] I'll not do it I'll not get in it
[1:29:32] and she watched him
[1:29:34] as he walked out there beside that mud
[1:29:36] hole and he was throwing rocks and
[1:29:39] over in it
[1:29:42] you know and after a while he took his
[1:29:44] shoes off
[1:29:47] and
[1:29:50] and he took his shoes off and
[1:29:54] and he uh put his toe over in it
[1:30:00] and it wasn't long
[1:30:04] he was he was having a bath
[1:30:12] when he finally came back in
[1:30:15] she said you told me you wouldn't do it
[1:30:16] anymore he said the devil made me do it
[1:30:21] he said he got behind me and pushed me
[1:30:24] in
[1:30:30] my buddy told me that
[1:30:33] had a young man that was coming to
[1:30:34] church and all of a sudden he was
[1:30:36] missing for a weekend
[1:30:38] and so he asked him he said where would

[1:30:49] but he said last weekend I just had to
[1:30:51] go get myself drunk
[1:30:57] and my buddy had to explain to him that
[1:30:59] ain't how this works
[1:31:06] just because our credit card gets paid
[1:31:09] up
[1:31:11] and you don't sin no more don't give us

[1:31:30] well brother Ron but I fell get up again
[1:31:36] he said wherever one condemned no matter
[1:31:38] what we do we're condemned
[1:31:41] we were born condemned
[1:31:45] when you were born you were born
[1:31:47] condemned your mom and Poppy was born
[1:31:50] condemned
[1:31:52] you're all all your ancestors was born
[1:31:55] in sin in shape and iniquity how are you
[1:31:57] ever going to get it how are you going
[1:31:59] to be perfect
[1:32:00] if you ever done a thing never stole
[1:32:04] never lied never done anything in your
[1:32:07] life you're still condemned
[1:32:11] and you were judged of God before you
[1:32:13] breathed your first breath
[1:32:17] for you were judged by the sexual desire
[1:32:20] of your father and mother and through
[1:32:22] their act brought you on the earth and
[1:32:25] God condemned it in the beginning
[1:32:27] you're condemned to start with
[1:32:30] and every other person on the Earth
[1:32:33] what's condemned with you
[1:32:37] there is a perfection
[1:32:42] oh I love that don't you
[1:32:46] now
[1:32:47] I want you to just notice
[1:32:51] when that woman went and touched the Hem
[1:32:53] of His Garment
[1:32:57] she immediately knew
[1:32:59] she was well
[1:33:03] it was immediate
[1:33:08] sister Jeanetta
[1:33:11] brother Tim was here because of my
[1:33:13] father's funeral
[1:33:15] and you had came
[1:33:17] and you stood at the altar right there
[1:33:19] and you found a special part in brother
[1:33:22] Tim's heart
[1:33:25] now brother Tim couldn't save you
[1:33:28] but he found a certain
[1:33:31] a certain
[1:33:34] prayer for you
[1:33:37] and so every once in a while he'll ask
[1:33:40] how's she doing
[1:33:43] don't miss a service she's doing real
[1:33:46] good
[1:33:47] over Labor Day he he saw you shouting he
[1:33:51] said she's doing real good
[1:33:52] she's doing real good
[1:33:55] now brother Tim couldn't do that for you
[1:33:58] I couldn't do that for you I've been
[1:34:00] your friend since you were a girl
[1:34:02] when y'all were living in a trailer just
[1:34:04] across the hill
[1:34:05] and me and Connie were dating
[1:34:07] your mom and dad were throwing things at
[1:34:09] each other at that point in time
[1:34:13] but you see I couldn't save you
[1:34:16] and neither could Brenda when you would
[1:34:18] maybe sit on her porch and talk to her
[1:34:20] about things of life
[1:34:23] she walked in this building the same as
[1:34:25] that woman touched the Hem of its
[1:34:27] garment and you knew that you couldn't
[1:34:28] stay the way you wasn't don't you like
[1:34:30] it when God talks personally to you
[1:34:33] and you knew you couldn't stay the way
[1:34:35] that you were and if you can ever get in
[1:34:36] these presence one time
[1:34:42] how do you know that brother Ron you're
[1:34:44] a preacher
[1:34:45] I went to service
[1:34:47] with a 12-pack in my car
[1:34:51] with my grandma she wasn't on a drink
[1:34:54] with me
[1:34:58] but I was headed to a party after that
[1:35:00] service I walked to the Altar and looked
[1:35:03] across and she was at the altar and she
[1:35:06] could out curse most Marines
[1:35:10] my mother's mother my mother's mother I
[1:35:12] want to make that clear
[1:35:14] bless her little heart
[1:35:20] and there was times in her journey she
[1:35:22] still needed more of Jesus
[1:35:29] when I walked out of the building that
[1:35:31] night I I didn't have to go to any
[1:35:33] classes
[1:35:35] I drove across the street
[1:35:37] and it was a can now remember they used
[1:35:39] to have cans
[1:35:41] for trash
[1:35:43] and I took that and I put it in that can
[1:35:46] I threw it away and I said I'll not need
[1:35:50] that no more
[1:35:51] and I never turned back
[1:35:55] [Applause]
[1:36:04] I want to tell you one more and then I'm
[1:36:06] going to close
[1:36:07] because I seem to be a little low
[1:36:12] and so
[1:36:15] we had been married three years
[1:36:19] and brother Homer had bought his home
[1:36:21] place
[1:36:23] and whenever I came down for a few days
[1:36:25] off
[1:36:26] we'd work
[1:36:30] and brother Homer had me
[1:36:32] painting the chimney
[1:36:35] and is up on the ladder painting a
[1:36:36] chimney
[1:36:38] and Homer hollered at me and he said why
[1:36:40] don't you come down here Ronald
[1:36:43] he always called me Ronald
[1:36:46] he said come down here
[1:36:49] I said okay
[1:36:51] he said why don't you come now
[1:36:54] and Homer wasn't one to cry
[1:36:56] but he was crying
[1:37:00] and I said yeah what's up
[1:37:05] you know for those that didn't meet him
[1:37:07] he was tougher nails
[1:37:11] he was tough for nails I got bit by a
[1:37:13] copperhead one time
[1:37:14] he was about 300 yards away and I walked
[1:37:17] up to him and I told him I got bit by a
[1:37:19] copperhead and he he pulled out a bottle
[1:37:21] that was in his pocket and he gave me
[1:37:23] two benadryls put his hand on my head
[1:37:25] like that right there and said that the
[1:37:27] name of Jesus go be well go back and
[1:37:29] finish what you're doing
[1:37:33] hey it worked
[1:37:35] [Applause]
[1:37:47] he said three years ago I was wrong
[1:37:48] about you
[1:37:50] and he said I prayed God you you
[1:37:54] answered every prayer
[1:37:57] but you let my daughter
[1:38:00] marry you
[1:38:03] he's gonna I couldn't see what you would
[1:38:06] become
[1:38:10] I said I want you to forgive me
[1:38:14] we became best of buddies
[1:38:17] I probably drove him all over the United
[1:38:19] States and he still told me how to get
[1:38:21] there
[1:38:26] but you see sometimes we can't see one
[1:38:29] another
[1:38:30] and what they will be
[1:38:33] and what they are
[1:38:35] but when God places a seed on you
[1:38:39] you get that seed in the right
[1:38:40] atmosphere
[1:38:44] when that woman was inspired to leave
[1:38:47] her house
[1:38:50] two of them one was inspired to leave
[1:38:53] her a house that her physical being
[1:38:55] would be well
[1:38:57] the other one was inspired to take all
[1:39:00] that she had and go by ointment
[1:39:04] because she didn't want to live that way
[1:39:06] no more
[1:39:07] and they wouldn't make her well but she
[1:39:10] went to that service
[1:39:13] and if nobody else would worship him I
[1:39:16] wash his feet
[1:39:19] I'll cry because I want to repent
[1:39:24] I want to repent I don't want to be the
[1:39:26] same
[1:39:30] Hallelujah
[1:39:33] and I close tonight I'll finish tomorrow
[1:39:40] both of them went away
[1:39:42] never to be the same ever again
[1:39:47] and here's what I want to say to you
[1:39:49] tonight and what's been on my heart all
[1:39:51] week
[1:39:53] I don't want to only touch him one time
[1:40:00] I want to live in his presence
[1:40:05] I want my children
[1:40:07] my grandchildren yeah
[1:40:10] I want the children in this church
[1:40:14] Micah's sitting right here in front of
[1:40:16] me
[1:40:18] Micah you're sitting about where
[1:40:21] I would have been sitting at a meeting
[1:40:24] that we went to right after I got saved
[1:40:28] and brother biscoll preached a sermon on
[1:40:30] the breach between the church ages and
[1:40:34] the seals
[1:40:36] what the prophets and the leaders
[1:40:38] couldn't do it took Christ to reveal the
[1:40:41] book
[1:40:43] and I was sitting right about there and
[1:40:45] I was about 23 years old and I was
[1:40:48] sitting there and they took sister
[1:40:50] Connie because they thought she was a
[1:40:52] kid they took her to Sunday school
[1:40:55] and I was sitting right there alone
[1:40:59] sitting there listening to brother bisco
[1:41:02] preached that sermon God needed me to be
[1:41:05] in a spot to where I would hear it
[1:41:10] come on and I never forgot that meeting
[1:41:13] the rest of my life and I I spoke to him
[1:41:16] about brother about brother miskel about
