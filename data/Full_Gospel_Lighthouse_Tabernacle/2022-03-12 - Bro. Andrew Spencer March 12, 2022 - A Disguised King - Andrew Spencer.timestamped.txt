[39:08] over in the book of first kings chapter
[39:09] 22.
[39:12] first kings chapter 22 and verse 12
[39:15] and then we'll be jumping down to verse
[39:17] 28.
[39:19] that's directly after ii samuel and
[39:22] then right before second kings
[39:31] first kings chapter 22
[39:34] and verse 12.
[39:37] and all the prophets prophesied
[39:41] so saying go up to ramoth gilead and
[39:45] prosper
[39:46] for the lord shall deliver it into the
[39:48] king's hand
[39:50] and the messenger that was gone to call
[39:53] mikaya spake unto him saying behold now
[39:57] the words of the prophets declare unto
[40:00] the king
[40:01] with one mouth
[40:03] let thy word i pray thee be like the
[40:06] word of one of them notice what they're
[40:09] trying to get micaiah to do is to say
[40:11] the same thing that they were saying
[40:14] and speak that which is good and micaiah
[40:17] said as the lord liveth
[40:19] what the lord saith unto me that will i
[40:22] speak verse 28
[40:24] and mekiah said if thou return at all in
[40:28] peace the lord hath not spoken by me
[40:31] and he said hearken o people
[40:33] every one of you so the king of israel
[40:36] and jehoshaphat the king of judah went
[40:38] up to ramoth gilead
[40:40] and the king of israel said unto
[40:42] jehoshaphat i will disguise myself
[40:46] and enter into the battle
[40:48] but put thou on thy robes and the king
[40:50] of israel disguised himself and went
[40:53] into the bible notice
[40:55] jehoshaphat dressed as a king
[40:59] and the king of israel
[41:01] ahab
[41:02] disguised himself
[41:04] and went into the battle but the king of
[41:06] syria commanded his 32 captains that had
[41:09] ruled over his chariot saying fight
[41:11] neither was small nor great save only
[41:14] with the king of israel and it came to
[41:17] pass when the captains of the chariots
[41:19] saw jehoshaphat they said surely it is
[41:22] the king of israel
[41:24] and they turned aside to fight against
[41:26] him and jehoshaphat cried out and it
[41:29] came to pass that when the captains of
[41:31] the chariots perceived that it was not
[41:34] the king of israel that they turned back
[41:37] from pursuing him and a certain man drew
[41:39] a bow adventure and smote the king of
[41:42] israel between the joints of the harness
[41:45] wherefore he said unto the driver of his
[41:47] chariots
[41:48] turn thy hand and carry me out of the
[41:51] host for i am wounded
[41:53] and the battle increased that day and
[41:55] the king was stayed up in his chariots
[41:57] against the syrians and died at evening
[42:00] and the blood ran out of a wound into
[42:03] the midst
[42:04] of the chariots
[42:05] god bless you this evening you may be
[42:07] seated in the presence of the lord if
[42:09] you go down to verse 38 you'll find that
[42:12] it you'll find that there was a prophecy
[42:15] that was going to be fulfilled by that
[42:17] of elijah that said that the dogs would
[42:20] definitely
[42:21] they would lick the blood
[42:23] they would lick up the blood of the king
[42:26] notice i would like to speak to you this
[42:28] evening on a thought on a disguised king
[42:31] and i'd i'd actually been studying this
[42:33] song for the last two and a half months
[42:35] and and looking over these things and i
[42:37] won't take two and a half months to
[42:39] preach it to you this evening but i i
[42:41] was just waiting on the inspiration of
[42:43] the lord to strike and when to speak
[42:46] these things and
[42:47] and so by the help of the lord we'd like
[42:49] to speak to you on this thought on a
[42:51] disguised king and we know we know that
[42:54] that satan is the very arch enemy of god
[42:57] and we have a real devil that we're
[42:58] facing even right now in the midst of
[43:01] all of the chaos of this world we are
[43:03] facing a real devil
[43:04] and we know that there are people that
[43:06] tend to think that that the devil's not
[43:08] real but we're facing a real enemy and
[43:11] we're facing an enemy that that is
[43:13] wanting to destroy us and to kill and he
[43:16] wants to come in and he wants to destroy
[43:18] the very plan of god but this we know
[43:20] that satan as has been and always has
[43:24] been a deceiver from the very beginning
[43:26] and you go back and you start studying
[43:28] out the bible and you begin to look back
[43:31] into the bible in isaiah and other
[43:33] places you'll find that lucifer begins
[43:35] to make a shift in the corridors of
[43:37] heaven when he was rejecting what he was
[43:40] even created for as the worship as the
[43:43] worship leader in heaven and he began to
[43:45] turn he began to turn the angels of god
[43:48] and he began to tell them lies and they
[43:50] began to swoo them and woo them over
[43:53] onto his side and the bible said that
[43:56] that he deceived a portion of the angels
[43:59] of god and notice that god was not shook
[44:02] up about all of these things because he
[44:04] knew what lucifer was created for notice
[44:07] that even satan himself has still he's
[44:10] never lost any of his tactics he's he's
[44:12] still a slicker he's a slew foot he's a
[44:15] liar he's a deceiver he's a slanderer
[44:18] and we know that the enemy is against
[44:20] the very children of god
[44:22] and brother branham would say in
[44:23] questions and answers he said he said
[44:25] and two-thirds of the earth is in sin
[44:28] and more than that with
[44:30] and more than that which two-thirds of
[44:32] the angels was kicked out and those
[44:34] demon spirits coming to the people and
[44:36] habitat their bodies see they they they
[44:39] they're they those demons that once they
[44:42] that was once existence and they come
[44:44] into the people and they give them a
[44:47] nature notice they they give them a
[44:49] nature and jesus cast seven of them
[44:52] out of mary magdalene pride boasts big
[44:55] people you see unclean filthy vulgarity
[44:58] emulation strife and all these things
[45:01] and to think that those come out of mary
[45:03] magdalene and brother branham you'll
[45:05] find in one place that he said that mary
[45:07] magdalene thought that she was more
[45:09] beautiful than others and i know that
[45:11] strikes sometimes when you begin to
[45:13] preach on pride and preaching events
[45:15] about boasting and those things it hits
[45:17] with it hits with young children but
[45:20] it's it's a it's an enemy that would
[45:22] come on and and would make you think
[45:24] that you're prettier than somebody else
[45:26] and dog yourself up like that it's an
[45:28] enemy that comes in and diseases it's an
[45:30] enemy that comes in with all types of
[45:33] different avenues and tactics and that's
[45:35] what the enemy is trying to always come
[45:37] in and maybe you don't realize it
[45:39] brother branham would call the devil a
[45:41] slicker and he'll try to pull a trick on
[45:43] our young girls and he'll try to move
[45:45] his way in real slick-like and and and
[45:48] then he'll try and you know if brother
[45:50] madam would say that if he'd come in
[45:51] with a pitchfork nobody would believe
[45:53] him but he slides in like a like a
[45:55] gentleman he slides in maybe and tries
[45:58] to look real cute and tries to look real
[46:00] real nice but he's trying to come in and
[46:02] when he comes he's not coming for you to
[46:05] advance in christianity he's coming to
[46:07] steal he's coming to kill and he's
[46:10] coming to destroy the very plan of god
[46:12] and his children
[46:15] when you go to studying out the bible
[46:17] and you look up and you can find the you
[46:19] can find every time that you'll see the
[46:20] word devil throughout the new testament
[46:22] and you look at it in in the greek that
[46:25] it is diablos that is that is what the
[46:27] bible would say that he is a diablos
[46:30] which means a false accuser a slanderer
[46:33] that he's prone to slander he's
[46:35] slanderously accusing falsely that satan
[46:38] is the prince of demons he is the author
[46:42] of evil persecuting good men estranging
[46:46] mankind from god and enticing them to
[46:48] sin afflicting them with diseases by
[46:52] means of demons who take possession of
[46:54] their bodies at his bidding and to think
[46:58] that tonight that that people begin to
[47:00] think and roll through their mind that
[47:02] that that they think that sickness came
[47:04] from god
[47:06] it came from a devil you know that there
[47:09] are some people that believe that
[47:10] sickness well sickness came from god god
[47:13] must have put this on me for some reason
[47:15] no sickness did not come from god it is
[47:19] a devil and it is a devil that is not
[47:21] just wanting to make you sick it's
[47:23] wanting to kill you
[47:24] and we realize that that there is an
[47:27] enemy that we're facing not only in the
[47:29] flesh but in our spirit and in their
[47:32] soul that is trying to trying to strip
[47:34] us of everything that god built us for
[47:37] and the bible would tell us in ephesians
[47:39] in ephesians chapter 6 to put on the
[47:42] whole arm of god that you might be able
[47:44] to stand against the wiles of diablos
[47:47] and we know that joshua parallels
[47:50] ephesians that they run side by side
[47:53] that paul was speaking to the children
[47:55] of this day saying that this is your
[47:58] possession just like joshua would lay
[48:00] out the possession for all the children
[48:02] of israel he was laying out paul was
[48:05] laying out a possession for the children
[48:08] of god and he would tell us that that we
[48:10] are to put on the whole armor of god
[48:13] it's not just something that you put on
[48:15] every once in a while it's something
[48:17] that is always there it is the baptism
[48:20] of the holy ghost and when you put on
[48:22] this armor you are putting on almighty
[48:26] god and you are to stand against the
[48:28] very wiles of diablos
[48:31] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[48:33] blood but against principalities against
[48:36] powers against the rulers of the
[48:38] darkness of this world against spiritual
[48:40] weakness
[48:41] in high places james 4 7 tells us submit
[48:45] yourselves therefore to god
[48:47] and resist it means to oppose it means
[48:50] to stand against not stand for
[48:54] but to stand against
[48:57] the diabolos resist diabolos to think
[49:01] that you're going to come against
[49:02] sometime in your life you're going to
[49:04] come against satan himself notice he
[49:07] said submit yourselves therefore to god
[49:10] resist diablos and he will flee from you
[49:15] notice when the enemy comes in like a
[49:17] flood the spirit of the lord will raise
[49:19] up a standard notice jesus or james said
[49:22] draw an eye unto god and god will draw
[49:25] nigh unto you
[49:31] and the greatest battle ever fought
[49:37] brother branham said this great first
[49:38] battle that was ever fought
[49:40] began in heaven when michael and his
[49:42] angels fought against lucifer and his
[49:44] angels it far started the first battle
[49:46] was in heaven he said so sin did not
[49:49] originate on earth it originated
[49:52] in heaven and then it was thrown down
[49:54] from heaven and cast out of heaven to
[49:56] the earth and fell on human beings then
[49:59] the battle from angels become human
[50:02] battles and satan come to destroy god's
[50:05] creation what god had created to be for
[50:08] himself he had satan come to destroy
[50:11] this that's what his purpose was was to
[50:14] destroy it then the battle began here on
[50:17] earth and began in us and he's been
[50:20] raging ever since
[50:22] you think that tonight that that was his
[50:25] purpose that satan come to destroy the
[50:28] purpose of god that's what satan was
[50:31] built for satan has come with a purpose
[50:34] to destroy you destroy your mind destroy
[50:37] your ability destroy your destroy your
[50:40] your life and everything about you but
[50:43] notice what the bible says in first john
[50:45] in three and eight that he that
[50:47] committeth sin is of the devil for the
[50:49] devil sinneth from the beginning but
[50:51] notice for this purpose
[50:53] for this purpose the son of god was
[50:55] manifested that he might destroy the
[50:59] works of diablos
[51:01] to think that tonight that you're not
[51:03] fighting this battle alone
[51:05] that's why when moses was standing there
[51:08] he would tell them that the lord your
[51:10] god will fight your battles
[51:13] notice for this purpose jesus came into
[51:16] this world to destroy the works the very
[51:20] purpose the very plan of diablos do you
[51:23] realize that tonight that there is a
[51:25] plan that is set up against you by all
[51:28] of hell
[51:30] they have plans they have purposes that
[51:33] they are lining up for the very children
[51:36] of god
[51:37] but i want you to know that the bible
[51:38] said in jude chapter 1 that these fallen
[51:42] angels they lost their first estate but
[51:45] i want you to know that you as a son of
[51:48] god have been redeemed and been restored
[51:51] back to your first estate you always was
[51:54] a son always will be a son never will
[51:58] not ever be taken away from god because
[52:01] you
[52:02] are not part of the devil
[52:07] and satan cannot stand that you have
[52:09] more power than he could ever dream of
[52:11] having
[52:14] but we know that brother random would
[52:15] lay it out and the greatest battle ever
[52:17] fought that there is a chosen place of
[52:19] battle and brother adam would say that
[52:21] god chose a heart but satan chose the
[52:24] mind and when he come to a battle is it
[52:27] a test it's a test of powers it's a test
[52:30] of strength against it's and against
[52:32] opponents
[52:33] and it's there is a mutual meeting place
[52:36] and brother random will tell us that
[52:37] decisions are made in the mind
[52:40] it is the mind that accepts the word of
[52:42] god and that mind channels the very word
[52:45] of god into your spirit and into your
[52:47] soul and there is where it brings life
[52:50] into you
[52:51] notice where satan wars with you he wars
[52:54] with you in your flesh he wars with you
[52:57] in your spirit and he tries to get to
[52:59] you at nighttime when you're so
[53:01] vulnerable when you can't can't be on
[53:03] guard he comes and gives you nightmares
[53:06] dreams things that make you dream things
[53:08] that you would never dream of
[53:11] he slips in through your nightmares and
[53:14] tries to destroy your spirit and destroy
[53:16] your mind and he comes and he works
[53:19] through reasonings and he works through
[53:20] memory and he works through conscience
[53:23] and he works through emotions and
[53:24] through affections that's where he's
[53:26] battling you at is in the realm of your
[53:29] mind
[53:30] but god is working in a greater place on
[53:33] the wrong throne room of your heart
[53:36] and when the word of god the very spirit
[53:39] of god when it begin again to take place
[53:41] and you grab that very word of god jesus
[53:43] said if you abide in me and my words
[53:46] abide in you you ask what you will and
[53:48] it shall be done unto you satan cannot
[53:51] get to that soul when it's sealed by the
[53:53] baptism of the holy ghost he's sitting
[53:56] there as the king of your heart
[54:01] now let me just let me just drop this
[54:03] right here you may you have always been
[54:05] a son you always were a son
[54:08] and nothing can rob that from you there
[54:11] were some times in my life that i did
[54:13] not look like a spencer i didn't act
[54:15] like a spencer but i always was a
[54:18] spencer
[54:20] there were some times in my life i did
[54:22] not look like a son of god but i always
[54:25] was a son of god
[54:26] because there was something that was
[54:28] greater than myself that was deposited
[54:31] before there ever was an atom that was
[54:33] created before there ever was a molecule
[54:36] that was created i was in god's mind
[54:43] hallelujah
[54:45] hallelujah now this word disguise it
[54:47] means to conceal
[54:49] by counterfeit
[54:51] i don't i doubt any i doubt any
[54:54] young people grew up and became somebody
[54:56] like myself but
[54:57] do you ever remember
[54:59] as a child
[55:01] going through the house and breaking
[55:03] something that was valuable
[55:05] i had to do this when i was a little bit
[55:06] older
[55:08] i won't tell everything it's under the
[55:10] blood ain't that right mama
[55:14] you ever go through the house and you
[55:16] break something valuable
[55:17] and and
[55:19] you finally got yourself a car and you
[55:21] can go out
[55:22] you're looking for something that looks
[55:24] like what you broke
[55:26] and you're trying to replace it but
[55:28] mama knows
[55:30] and you're trying to get what you broke
[55:32] and put it back what you're doing is
[55:34] you're buying a counterfeit and trying
[55:36] to put back when maybe you broke that
[55:38] fine time or something and you go down
[55:41] to the dollar general mama knows
[55:46] you can't get the same stuff at dollar
[55:48] general as you can get over
[55:50] at pottery barn in other places but it
[55:52] is you're trying to disguise something
[55:54] you're trying to cover up something
[55:56] you're trying to disguise it a disguise
[55:59] means to hide an identity and here we
[56:02] are living in an hour where men are
[56:05] under an identity crisis
[56:08] when they don't know who they are they
[56:10] don't know where they're going or coming
[56:14] they don't know which bathroom to get
[56:15] into
[56:17] and they're trying to dress himself up
[56:20] as something that they are not
[56:25] but i'm afraid that that spirit don't
[56:27] just stay out there in the natural but
[56:29] it tries to move in to the spiritual and
[56:32] it tries to make people profess to be
[56:35] christians
[56:36] dress like christians try to act like
[56:39] christians but still living like the
[56:41] world
[56:44] and ahab was just one of these kind of
[56:47] men
[56:48] that got on that side and we know well
[56:51] well it's it's rightfully hours for us
[56:53] to go down there and get ramos gilead
[56:55] that's what jehoshaphat and ahab were
[56:57] joining themselves up together was to go
[57:00] back to that you know this was our
[57:01] original property to go down there and
[57:04] reclaim ramos gilead but you know one
[57:06] thing brother branham said he said they
[57:08] never went and approached it by prayer
[57:11] first
[57:12] they never approached it by prayer and
[57:14] brother barron would say let's just give
[57:16] out some characteristics of ahab a
[57:19] brother adam would say about ahab he
[57:21] said he was a borderline believer
[57:23] he would say that he was living off the
[57:25] past reputations of other israelite
[57:28] kings and ahab he carried himself as a
[57:32] borderline believer
[57:36] he never knew where he stood out he was
[57:38] either on one side of the fence or the
[57:40] other side of the fence ahab was not
[57:43] stable he always went with a trend and
[57:45] he was famous for listening to his
[57:47] prostitute wife
[57:50] it was because of ahab listening to
[57:53] jezebel that they were guilty for
[57:55] bringing back idolatry amongst the
[57:58] children of israel
[58:00] notice ahab was unstable
[58:03] sure he had some good things in his
[58:05] history sure he had some good things
[58:07] that took place but you watch what
[58:09] happened when he married that painted
[58:11] face jezebel
[58:13] he started going out and whoring after
[58:16] the things of babylon
[58:21] brother barron will you remember when
[58:22] brother branham he would talk about that
[58:23] old that old horse they had
[58:25] he talked about that old horse they had
[58:27] he said he was famous for jumping fences
[58:30] he said they jumped that fence and he
[58:31] said they finally got to a spot that
[58:33] they had to put a yoke on them just like
[58:34] you would do a cow they put that yoke on
[58:36] him he said that horse would he could
[58:38] stand there and eat alfalfa in their
[58:40] field all day long he said but he jumped
[58:43] that fence and he said brother venom
[58:45] said i got to wondering why in the world
[58:47] was that fence why was that horse
[58:49] jumping that fence
[58:51] and he said i got to watching him he
[58:53] said there he was had great alfalfa to
[58:55] eat in he said but i watched him and he
[58:57] would jump that fence get himself hung
[59:00] up on that fence with that yolk that he
[59:02] was wearing he hung in to hang himself
[59:04] up and he was going down in a sinkhole
[59:07] over there just getting some orchard
[59:09] grass
[59:10] he said when he got over there he said
[59:12] that sinkhole had all kinds of glass and
[59:14] trash in it and all types of different
[59:16] things he said and that horse was
[59:18] cutting himself up
[59:20] cutting himself up going across that
[59:21] fence going over there he said he had
[59:24] good food to eat on right there he said
[59:26] but he went over in that little sinkhole
[59:28] got himself all cut up they had to pull
[59:30] him back out of there and he said he
[59:32] would sit there and quiver and shake and
[59:34] bleeding with all of those cuts that
[59:36] were on him just for a little grain
[59:40] of orchard grass
[59:42] he said that reminded me that the way of
[59:44] a transgressor is hard
[59:46] you'll leave all of this spiritual food
[59:49] and due season just to go out and go out
[59:52] and live with the world just for a
[59:54] little bit
[59:55] giants like the world just for a little
[59:57] bit dress like the world just for a
[59:59] little bit
[1:00:00] and brother branham said that that's
[1:00:02] what the church of the living god he
[1:00:04] said that's what the church is doing he
[1:00:06] said not the bride he said but the
[1:00:08] church is living off of their past
[1:00:10] reputations just like ahab was doing
[1:00:14] you look at the methodists they're
[1:00:15] living off the past reputations you look
[1:00:18] at the baptists they're living off their
[1:00:20] past reputations of days gone by just
[1:00:22] like the pentecost today they're living
[1:00:24] off of days gone by we used to dance in
[1:00:26] the spirit we used to shout in the
[1:00:28] spirit but the church of the living god
[1:00:30] the bride of jesus christ ain't having
[1:00:32] to live off past reputations she's
[1:00:34] living right in the shekinah glory
[1:00:37] [Applause]
[1:00:39] god never respected israel where she
[1:00:42] where she was and where she had been he
[1:00:45] said he only respected her where she was
[1:00:48] in that moment
[1:00:50] and you cannot live off of days gone by
[1:00:54] some people said in church to say like i
[1:00:56] feel with the holy ghost 30 years ago i
[1:00:58] guess that's good enough
[1:00:59] really
[1:01:02] you say well tell me about when you got
[1:01:04] the baptism of the holy ghost i'll say
[1:01:05] which time
[1:01:08] there's been many times i've been
[1:01:10] refilled by the baptism of the holy
[1:01:13] ghost there's one feeling but many
[1:01:15] refillings
[1:01:18] thank the lord for that
[1:01:19] you don't just run your car off of one
[1:01:21] tank of gas you got to run that baby
[1:01:24] it's expensive right now but you gotta
[1:01:25] go and get that thing and fill it up if
[1:01:27] you're planning to go somewhere
[1:01:30] that's the way some people do with
[1:01:32] church
[1:01:34] they can get their field off of one
[1:01:36] service
[1:01:37] a month
[1:01:39] let me get back on track here
[1:01:43] but they they called up all these 400
[1:01:45] prophets and these 400 prophets had
[1:01:47] already declared sure you're going to go
[1:01:49] out there zedekiah he took these horns
[1:01:51] and said this is how you're going to
[1:01:53] take the battle you're going to go out
[1:01:54] there and they already had the majority
[1:01:57] but jehoshaphat knew that there wasn't
[1:02:00] something right with that backslidden
[1:02:01] king ahab
[1:02:03] he said is there just one more out there
[1:02:07] surely there's got to be one more out
[1:02:09] there that we can talk to and ahab said
[1:02:11] yeah there's one micaiah the son of him
[1:02:14] look he said but he never prophesies
[1:02:16] anything good about me he's always
[1:02:18] telling me i can't live with my wife
[1:02:20] jezebel he's always telling me things
[1:02:22] that i'm doing they're wrong
[1:02:24] he said but go up there and get him and
[1:02:26] they went up there and got micaiah and
[1:02:28] said now look here if you want your way
[1:02:30] back into the church where you can have
[1:02:32] your cards and your creeds and
[1:02:33] everything else and we'll invite you
[1:02:35] back in you've got to say the same thing
[1:02:37] that we're saying
[1:02:40] he said i will only say what god puts in
[1:02:43] my mouth
[1:02:44] they already they already had the
[1:02:46] majority them 400 prophets but mekiah
[1:02:49] had the word of god on his side
[1:02:51] he said if you go out to that battle and
[1:02:54] return back god's not even spoken unto
[1:02:56] me
[1:02:58] but there you'll find if you go back and
[1:02:59] read first kings 22 that there was a
[1:03:02] lion spirit that went before god
[1:03:05] and notice brother branham would say
[1:03:07] that he went out there to see
[1:03:09] who could persuade ahab
[1:03:14] and
[1:03:15] and zedekiah went up and slapped mikaya
[1:03:18] mikaya upside the face and said where
[1:03:20] with the spirit of god when it went out
[1:03:22] of me
[1:03:24] but this man was not willing to
[1:03:26] compromise on the word of god
[1:03:30] he was not willing to hide he was not
[1:03:32] willing to hide and he was not willing
[1:03:34] to compromise
[1:03:36] you see you cannot compromise with god
[1:03:39] you cannot camouflage your sin you
[1:03:40] cannot disguise your sin
[1:03:44] if you're a sinner here you'll be a
[1:03:45] sinner there but if you're righteous
[1:03:47] here you'll be righteous there
[1:03:49] you cannot camouflage sin just like when
[1:03:52] adam and eve were in the garden of eden
[1:03:54] when they were there and they were
[1:03:55] walking and they don't sinned away they
[1:03:58] didn't send away their day of grace and
[1:04:00] they knew that they did wrong and they
[1:04:01] covered themself up with fig leaves and
[1:04:03] they were trying to hide but you can't
[1:04:06] hide from an all-seeing god
[1:04:10] and there they were walking but god had
[1:04:12] already seen them
[1:04:14] but he didn't send them out in that way
[1:04:16] he sent them out with the blood
[1:04:20] he sent them out with the blood that was
[1:04:21] covering them you see humanity is always
[1:04:24] trying to hide from god
[1:04:27] trying to camouflage itself up
[1:04:32] us brothers know about that camo you
[1:04:33] want the best pattern you want
[1:04:35] everything just right so that you can
[1:04:36] hide in the trees so that the deer or
[1:04:39] the wildlife can't see you but i want
[1:04:42] you to know you can put the best
[1:04:43] camouflage on you that you want to in
[1:04:46] your own walk but god already sees on
[1:04:48] the other side of your camouflage
[1:04:50] you can try to hide and you can try to
[1:04:52] run but god's already found your hiding
[1:04:54] place
[1:04:56] and these false prophets were
[1:04:58] prophesying that they would come out and
[1:04:59] they would win the battle you see that's
[1:05:02] what a false prophet will do it'll
[1:05:03] prophesy you right in the tribulation
[1:05:05] but i'm standing tonight with a true
[1:05:07] prophet and a true prophet will prophesy
[1:05:10] you right into the rapture unto the
[1:05:12] coming of the lord
[1:05:16] but ahab ahab's done with this king
[1:05:19] a king of syria king been ahead of god
[1:05:22] he doesn't whooped him twice
[1:05:25] but he released him
[1:05:29] you know what happens when you let sin
[1:05:31] get out
[1:05:33] it'll come back and it'll come to
[1:05:35] destroy you again
[1:05:38] it's just like the demon you can sweep
[1:05:41] out the place and he finds it ain't
[1:05:43] filled yet he's bringing back seven more
[1:05:45] of his brothers that are worse than him
[1:05:46] own self
[1:05:48] and they ahab had done whooped him twice
[1:05:51] done captain put him in captivity ben
[1:05:54] haddad put him in captivity and let him
[1:05:56] out so that he could have his own
[1:05:59] trading in the marketplace of damascus
[1:06:02] and there he let him out just for a
[1:06:03] trade
[1:06:05] isn't that how sin does you it makes you
[1:06:08] want to trade out eternal life
[1:06:10] for laodicea
[1:06:12] sin has a way where it's pleasurable for
[1:06:15] a season where it disguises himself and
[1:06:18] makes it look good appeal looks good
[1:06:20] just for a moment a bottle looks good
[1:06:22] just for a moment but just give it to
[1:06:24] the next morning you'll wake up needing
[1:06:26] more of that
[1:06:28] but you take one pill this gospel and
[1:06:30] you'll be satisfied and filled and daily
[1:06:34] getting more and more of it it never
[1:06:36] runs out never wake up with a headache
[1:06:40] never woke up never wake up wondering
[1:06:42] where i've been and where i came from
[1:06:48] hallelujah
[1:06:52] but notice been a god
[1:06:55] he was not interested
[1:06:56] in anybody else but ahab
[1:07:00] he was not interested in any of israel
[1:07:02] he wasn't interested in the rest of
[1:07:05] jehoshaphat he was only interested in
[1:07:07] ahab
[1:07:09] because ben haddad wanted to remove the
[1:07:12] stain of captivity off of his life
[1:07:16] he wanted to remove where he'd been
[1:07:18] imprisoned by this king of israel he
[1:07:21] wanted to remove that stain of captivity
[1:07:24] off of him
[1:07:25] i tell you there's sometimes we need to
[1:07:27] take the same tactic that the enemy has
[1:07:30] and put it in our own life when we
[1:07:32] remove the stain of captivity off of our
[1:07:35] life
[1:07:37] if there's one thing that we can learn
[1:07:39] from ben haddad let's remove the stain
[1:07:41] of captivity off of our life let me tell
[1:07:44] you this church the blood is pushing you
[1:07:47] and removing the stain of captivity off
[1:07:51] of your life
[1:07:54] and they have dressed himself up just
[1:07:56] like some ordinary man
[1:07:59] tried to look like a common person try
[1:08:02] to look like just anybody else
[1:08:06] do you hear what i'm saying
[1:08:08] trying to disguise himself
[1:08:10] so that he wouldn't be noticed
[1:08:12] but there was prophecy that was laying
[1:08:15] out there
[1:08:18] and one of the captains
[1:08:19] shot an arrow
[1:08:21] this arrow was connected with prophecy
[1:08:24] that there would be dogs that would lick
[1:08:25] up the blood of ahab
[1:08:28] he disguised himself
[1:08:30] but you can't hide from god
[1:08:33] you can run
[1:08:34] but you can't hide
[1:08:40] well i'm nervous about what's going on
[1:08:41] in russia i'm not
[1:08:45] i'm worried i'm worried some people say
[1:08:46] well i'm worried about what's going on i
[1:08:48] was talking with an individual the past
[1:08:50] couple weeks and they get so shook up
[1:08:53] when you start talking about the end
[1:08:55] time
[1:08:56] claim to be christians claim to be
[1:08:58] claimed to claim to be real christians
[1:09:00] and go to church and live a life but you
[1:09:02] start talking about end time and he
[1:09:04] start talking about god coming over and
[1:09:06] making the earth new again and they get
[1:09:08] all shook up because they know they
[1:09:10] don't have a token life that will get
[1:09:12] them out of here
[1:09:14] they're living under the disguise or the
[1:09:17] cloak of religion of christianity
[1:09:20] but christianity is not a cloak
[1:09:23] it's a life
[1:09:25] it's a life that's got to be lived and
[1:09:27] only you know when you put your head on
[1:09:30] the pillow or night if you really got
[1:09:32] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:34] [Applause]
[1:09:44] prophecy was coming after ahab
[1:09:46] but you remember one time samuel
[1:09:48] disguised himself
[1:09:50] or saul disguised himself
[1:09:53] and he went down there
[1:09:55] went down to the witch of endor
[1:09:57] when the word of god wouldn't speak to
[1:09:59] him and the urim and thumbing wouldn't
[1:10:00] light up and all the heavens had been
[1:10:01] shut off
[1:10:03] because
[1:10:04] saul wouldn't kill off sin
[1:10:09] because he wouldn't kill off sin
[1:10:12] he had this saying samuel couldn't
[1:10:14] answer him samuel done died been dead
[1:10:16] two years hurim and thumbing wouldn't
[1:10:18] light up he god had shut up the heavens
[1:10:21] and he wouldn't hear him
[1:10:24] because he wouldn't cut off sin
[1:10:27] and when you are willingly not cutting
[1:10:29] off sin god will not hear you
[1:10:33] when you shut off the voice of warning
[1:10:35] god will not hear you
[1:10:36] go back and read proverbs chapter seven
[1:10:39] when it when it talks about the house
[1:10:41] and the warning of going by the house of
[1:10:43] the idolatrous how that the voice of
[1:10:45] warning that the father was telling
[1:10:46] don't go buy that house of the
[1:10:48] idolatrous don't go by that way but the
[1:10:50] bible said that the young men without
[1:10:52] understanding went out into the streets
[1:10:55] where that woman was lurking and the
[1:10:58] bible said that she was a loud woman she
[1:11:00] was boastful in what she was showing
[1:11:04] she was posed for and what she was
[1:11:06] selling
[1:11:07] but the bible said that that the bible
[1:11:09] said to hearken unto her hearken unto
[1:11:12] god it said don't hearken unto her but
[1:11:14] her house is a house that is a way to
[1:11:17] hell
[1:11:18] and it leads to the chambers of death
[1:11:23] you think well it's just for a moment
[1:11:26] it literally is only for a moment
[1:11:30] if you live all of your life to be 100
[1:11:32] years old 100 years old it's only for a
[1:11:34] moment
[1:11:35] but what are you willing to give up
[1:11:39] for eternity
[1:11:41] it's amazing what people would sell
[1:11:42] their birth right out for
[1:11:46] esau sold out for a for a for uh for a
[1:11:50] bowl of quaker oat he sold out for just
[1:11:53] a little with a little bit of oatmeal a
[1:11:55] little bit of partage well it's amazing
[1:11:57] what what elvis sold his soul out for
[1:12:01] for a fleet of cadillacs
[1:12:04] it's amazing what marilyn monroe sold
[1:12:06] her soul out for
[1:12:11] but when it comes to that time
[1:12:14] when it comes to your deathbed
[1:12:16] who's going to be standing there
[1:12:20] you rejected the voice of warning
[1:12:23] and samuel had done told him what to do
[1:12:27] and so did not listen to what the voice
[1:12:30] had told him to do
[1:12:32] just like pearl harbor they turned down
[1:12:35] the voice of warning when they'd been
[1:12:37] told that the japs were coming and they
[1:12:39] were going to invade the land but that
[1:12:41] night they stayed out there drinking and
[1:12:44] carousing and having themselves a party
[1:12:47] while all along the japanese were making
[1:12:49] their way over
[1:12:54] brother branham said don't you worry
[1:12:55] about russia he said america's
[1:12:58] destroying itself from the inside
[1:13:04] my goodness
[1:13:06] but samuel went down there so went down
[1:13:08] to samuel and he calls on notice what
[1:13:11] he's calling on
[1:13:12] notice what sin will make you do it'll
[1:13:15] make you go down to the house of a
[1:13:17] medium when saul was the one that made
[1:13:20] them be kicked out of the very ban them
[1:13:22] out of the country and the witch of
[1:13:24] endure when she starts calling on samuel
[1:13:26] said i see god's rising out because
[1:13:29] samuel was still in his prophetic robe
[1:13:35] hallelujah he was still a prophet
[1:13:38] even though he'd been dead two years he
[1:13:40] was still a prophet and he said i see
[1:13:42] you you'll die in the battle tomorrow
[1:13:45] you and your son jonathan
[1:13:48] he was still in his prophetic robe let
[1:13:50] me say this you can make fun of this
[1:13:52] message all you want to but william
[1:13:54] branham's still a prophet and there's
[1:13:56] prophecy that is riding on you and i but
[1:13:59] we will not be carried away with every
[1:14:01] wind and doctrine we will be carried on
[1:14:05] on the wings of a snow white dove
[1:14:08] there's a prophet's prophecy that's got
[1:14:11] to be fulfilled that we will mortal this
[1:14:14] mortal will put on immortality
[1:14:16] [Applause]
[1:14:20] still a prophet
[1:14:22] still a prophet
[1:14:24] and they missed
[1:14:26] they
[1:14:26] missed they missed jesus
[1:14:30] satan's a slicker
[1:14:32] and satan's sneaky
[1:14:34] and he'll make you backslide and you
[1:14:36] think well i
[1:14:37] uh you know what's a ball game going to
[1:14:39] hurt what's one time going to
[1:14:41] it ain't what happens out there you
[1:14:43] backslide right here in church
[1:14:48] you see that's where you do your
[1:14:50] greatest backsliding we think well i'm
[1:14:52] okay i've been in church all my life and
[1:14:54] i've i've done all these things and you
[1:14:56] sit there
[1:14:58] man this is getting
[1:15:01] but you sit there and you get under the
[1:15:03] cloak
[1:15:04] of the message
[1:15:08] god sent a prophet i'm okay
[1:15:11] are you really
[1:15:15] brother byron would say in one place he
[1:15:17] said you can have the baptism of the
[1:15:19] holy ghost every single day of your life
[1:15:21] and go to hell
[1:15:23] i don't understand that you can have it
[1:15:25] on your flesh
[1:15:27] you can listen to the tapes every single
[1:15:29] day of your life you can sit under one
[1:15:30] of the greatest ministries
[1:15:32] and still ride your way straight to hell
[1:15:35] because you never accepted the token
[1:15:41] well you what's one time of sneaking out
[1:15:43] on my husband once one time i turn it on
[1:15:45] turning on that wrong music what did eve
[1:15:48] what did eve listen to
[1:15:51] a slicker
[1:15:53] and he's only wanting you to smoke one
[1:15:55] cigarette he's only wanting you to turn
[1:15:57] on and listen to rock and roll brother
[1:15:59] branham said and in tights and spirits
[1:16:00] he said you're our young people they can
[1:16:03] hear rock and roll one time and it
[1:16:05] catches them
[1:16:06] oh
[1:16:07] but it just soothes my soul
[1:16:11] really i've only found one thing that
[1:16:13] soothes my soul
[1:16:17] i can tell you this old gospel sometimes
[1:16:20] it may rub your fur the wrong way but
[1:16:23] i'll tell you it's doing it for the
[1:16:24] right thing
[1:16:27] we say well i don't know if i can handle
[1:16:29] this kind of preaching the reason why
[1:16:30] you're here is because you're able to
[1:16:32] handle it
[1:16:34] if god didn't think that you were able
[1:16:36] to handle it he wouldn't have you set
[1:16:38] here but they didn't receive it when
[1:16:41] jesus walked on the shores of galilee
[1:16:43] two thousand years ago
[1:16:48] and the devil invaded you the united
[1:16:50] states and worked its way through
[1:16:52] hollywood and worked its way through
[1:16:53] magazines and worked its way into our
[1:16:55] televisions and worked its way into our
[1:16:57] houses and it's robbed the very joy out
[1:17:00] of life
[1:17:03] kids can't sit at a table anymore
[1:17:05] without having a distraction in front of
[1:17:07] them
[1:17:10] what am i doing
[1:17:15] but they've got to have something their
[1:17:17] minds are so bombarded and so filled
[1:17:20] with but they turn down the very life of
[1:17:23] almighty god
[1:17:25] when the holy ghost is moving they they
[1:17:27] don't want nothing else to do with it
[1:17:29] but the mind of god is for a people
[1:17:32] and notice notice when jesus was walking
[1:17:36] on earth 2 000 years ago there he was
[1:17:38] walking in flesh walking in elements
[1:17:41] just like you and i and the bible said
[1:17:43] that god immorphy he changed his mask
[1:17:49] there he was in the pillar of fire that
[1:17:50] led to children of israel there he was
[1:17:52] that that led moses there he was that
[1:17:54] met with abraham but he changed his mask
[1:17:59] you know i went to
[1:18:01] i went to a a play a high school play
[1:18:03] the other day
[1:18:04] my brother nathan and his school they
[1:18:06] put on a play
[1:18:07] there and we we went and we watched
[1:18:10] and i was watching and brother nathan
[1:18:12] did a did a fantastic job
[1:18:15] and uh
[1:18:16] i i
[1:18:17] and i was watching i was watching behind
[1:18:20] the scenes of everything that was going
[1:18:22] on
[1:18:23] and you're watching and every person's
[1:18:25] got a part every person knows what
[1:18:26] they've got to do where they've got to
[1:18:28] fit in and where they've got to stand
[1:18:30] but i noticed that there were certain
[1:18:32] people that played different parts but
[1:18:35] it was the same person but they were
[1:18:37] changing their act they were changing
[1:18:39] their wardrobe they were changing their
[1:18:41] mask and that's what jesus did he was
[1:18:45] still the same yesterday today and
[1:18:47] forever he was still that pillar of fire
[1:18:50] he was still jehovah and when god hid
[1:18:53] himself in the humanity of jesus what
[1:18:58] did he do
[1:18:59] what did he do he was humbling he
[1:19:01] humbled himself and went in behind the
[1:19:04] veil of jesus so that the rest of the
[1:19:06] world couldn't see that it was jehovah
[1:19:08] but jehovah was standing there behind
[1:19:11] human flesh
[1:19:14] he was just changing and morphing means
[1:19:16] to be changed so that you can catch the
[1:19:20] vision what happened up there in doth in
[1:19:23] that time when the winner went on low
[1:19:25] and gaha looked out the window he looked
[1:19:28] out the window and there the assyrian
[1:19:30] army was coming up and gahesa said last
[1:19:33] master what shall we do now
[1:19:37] but
[1:19:38] elijah just simply prayed
[1:19:40] lord open his eyes
[1:19:44] those angels was always there those
[1:19:47] angels was always watching over elijah
[1:19:51] but he simply only changed the vision of
[1:19:55] gehesa let me say this to you before you
[1:19:58] ever see it he's here
[1:20:00] and he's masked himself in the robe of
[1:20:03] jesus one more time
[1:20:06] when he stood there in front of those
[1:20:07] sadducees and he said before abraham was
[1:20:10] i am it was that same pillar of fire
[1:20:13] being manifested he was saying that i am
[1:20:16] that i am
[1:20:18] and he veiled himself in jesus that
[1:20:21] humble little man to keep them from
[1:20:23] seeing
[1:20:25] to keep them from seeing that this was
[1:20:26] jehovah and again he veils himself today
[1:20:30] in earth and vessels with the shekinah
[1:20:32] glory and the outside looks like a bunch
[1:20:35] of holy rollers and the outskirt looks
[1:20:37] like a bunch of badger skins
[1:20:40] but on the inside it's a very succulent
[1:20:43] glory the same one that heir and the
[1:20:46] priest went in there in the tilde in the
[1:20:48] wilderness in the tabernacle it's that
[1:20:51] same shekinah glory that's being
[1:20:53] tabernacled one more time
[1:20:55] it's the king that's sitting on the
[1:20:58] throne room of your heart and paul would
[1:21:01] say that we have this treasure
[1:21:05] we have this treasure in earth and
[1:21:08] vessels
[1:21:10] he would say that we are
[1:21:12] troubled on every side
[1:21:14] but we have this treasure
[1:21:18] we're troubled on every side yet not
[1:21:20] distressed
[1:21:21] we are perplexed
[1:21:23] but not in despair why because we have
[1:21:25] this treasure
[1:21:26] we're persecuted but not forsaken cast
[1:21:29] down but not destroyed why because we
[1:21:32] have a treasure
[1:21:34] young people young girls don't let no
[1:21:37] young man or some some slicker come in
[1:21:39] and try to steal your treasure
[1:21:42] don't let some slicker come into your
[1:21:44] household and try to steal your wife
[1:21:46] hide your treasure
[1:21:48] the greatest treasure is not what you
[1:21:50] have in this earth
[1:21:53] what rob what moth and rust can corrupt
[1:21:55] but your treasure must be in heaven
[1:21:59] that's why we've got to set our
[1:22:01] affection on things above
[1:22:04] because we have this treasure we can go
[1:22:07] through hell because we have this
[1:22:09] treasure we can go through cancer
[1:22:11] because we have this treasure
[1:22:14] it's the hidden glory of almighty god
[1:22:20] ahab tried to disguise
[1:22:22] himself hide himself
[1:22:26] from sin
[1:22:27] but jehovah is hiding himself
[1:22:31] in you
[1:22:37] and to think satan
[1:22:39] is looking
[1:22:41] after that people
[1:22:43] could this be them
[1:22:45] could it really could it really be those
[1:22:48] martin
[1:22:48] kids that take the rapture
[1:22:53] could it be the breedings could it be
[1:22:55] the homes could it be the thomases
[1:22:57] but god is hiding himself
[1:23:01] well it's so simple that's where god
[1:23:03] hides himself it's over the mind of the
[1:23:06] wise of the prudent but he reveals
[1:23:09] himself to babes such as we'll learn
[1:23:14] you think about these young people that
[1:23:16] come here and our little ones that come
[1:23:18] here and god hiding himself right there
[1:23:22] that no matter what they go through they
[1:23:25] have been given the very token life of
[1:23:28] almighty god
[1:23:30] what what came down in sabinia cannon he
[1:23:32] was a king sword and the bible said that
[1:23:35] where the word of the king is there is
[1:23:38] power
[1:23:39] it can be in the littlest child it can
[1:23:41] be in the youngest adult it can be the
[1:23:43] oldest setting here it's a king sword
[1:23:46] where the king's power not a king the
[1:23:50] king
[1:23:52] don't you fear don't you fear that's
[1:23:54] just your third pool ministry
[1:23:57] what is it it's your ministry it's the
[1:24:00] ministry of the son of man making an
[1:24:03] invasion right into the united states
[1:24:05] again
[1:24:08] but they miss it
[1:24:13] notice i i'm gonna close with with these
[1:24:16] thoughts
[1:24:18] brother and said that's the way that
[1:24:20] people does today when fear strikes them
[1:24:22] when they're right in the path of duty
[1:24:24] listen brother let me say this if you're
[1:24:26] walking in the light and having
[1:24:27] fellowship with god with his people and
[1:24:29] the holy spirit is upon you
[1:24:31] and you meet an obstacle right in the
[1:24:33] path of duty
[1:24:35] don't stop
[1:24:37] [Music]
[1:24:39] just keep pressing on
[1:24:41] and god will make a way through it
[1:24:43] that's one of the greatest experiences
[1:24:45] of my life is to see god when i can't
[1:24:47] get over it when i can't get under when
[1:24:49] i can't get around it or any way god
[1:24:51] opens up a way and i go through it
[1:24:53] somehow or another his grace is
[1:24:55] sufficient to carry us through
[1:25:02] satan loves attacking you
[1:25:04] he loves attacking your mind he loves
[1:25:06] attacking your family he's been on your
[1:25:08] territory all throughout your family
[1:25:11] history but the god of power is right
[1:25:14] here
[1:25:15] the god that has baptized you into the
[1:25:18] body not by handshake not by a cloak of
[1:25:22] religionity not by the cloak of the
[1:25:24] message but by one spirit are we
[1:25:26] baptized into the body
[1:25:30] and satan cannot handle that
[1:25:33] he cannot handle the fact that this word
[1:25:37] is hidden
[1:25:38] behind badger skins again
[1:25:44] you know what i did brother andrew you
[1:25:46] know where i came from
[1:25:48] it's underneath the blood
[1:25:53] on the cross of calvary
[1:25:56] as far removed as darkness
[1:25:59] is from dawn
[1:26:02] the meanest
[1:26:04] of animals
[1:26:07] got a nasty nature
[1:26:09] an old badger
[1:26:11] but god wanted to hide himself
[1:26:15] right behind all of them skins
[1:26:19] because you don't take on your old man
[1:26:21] nature
[1:26:22] you take on his nature
[1:26:24] that's why when he was talking to
[1:26:26] nicodemus he said accept you'd be born
[1:26:29] again
[1:26:30] you cannot even see the kingdom of god
[1:26:33] you can't understand it
[1:26:36] well i've been
[1:26:37] i've been stepping out
[1:26:39] and i've been crossing the line i've
[1:26:41] been sitting on the fence i can tell you
[1:26:42] it's not a time to play church
[1:26:45] it's not a time to sit on the fence
[1:26:47] matter of fact there's no neutral ground
[1:26:50] it's a time to get in
[1:26:53] because satan can whip you if you're
[1:26:55] sitting on the fence
[1:26:57] he'll push you right back over on his
[1:26:58] side
[1:27:00] well i'm going to see i'm going to wait
[1:27:02] i'm going to wait and see if this
[1:27:03] message is really right
[1:27:07] i'm gonna wait and see if los angeles
[1:27:09] does what it's gonna do i'm gonna wait
[1:27:10] and see what russia does what it's gonna
[1:27:12] do it's too late
[1:27:14] it's now
[1:27:18] you don't have to conceal the holy ghost
[1:27:20] the holy ghost conceals itself in you
[1:27:24] holiness is right
[1:27:27] holiness will work its way out of you
[1:27:30] it'll push its way out you don't have to
[1:27:32] put it on
[1:27:34] it'll push its way out
[1:27:37] it's just like a fruit tree
[1:27:39] it doesn't have to manufacture it it
[1:27:41] just simply bears it
[1:27:44] you know once you actually figure it out
[1:27:46] it's pretty easy
[1:27:49] it's pretty easy to live a christian
[1:27:50] life won't you once you just let go
[1:27:53] but it's just something about that
[1:27:55] struggle of letting go
[1:27:58] it's real easy and i'll tell you what
[1:28:01] i'm closing and musicians can come but i
[1:28:03] can tell you
[1:28:05] i fought all my life to live this i
[1:28:08] tried everything within me i tried every
[1:28:10] i tried listening falling asleep to the
[1:28:12] message i tried i tried i tried
[1:28:14] everything i could
[1:28:17] but one time
[1:28:18] just letting go
[1:28:19] and let god take over
[1:28:24] it's completely yielding yourself and
[1:28:26] you just watch it ain't manufacturing it
[1:28:28] the devil knows if you're manufacturing
[1:28:30] it
[1:28:31] the devil knows if you're disguising
[1:28:33] yourself behind it
[1:28:35] but he knows when that king is sitting
[1:28:37] on the throne room of your heart
[1:28:39] and it just starts pushing out love and
[1:28:41] starts pushing out joy and it starts
[1:28:42] pushing out faithfulness it starts
[1:28:44] pushing out all the works of the holy
[1:28:46] ghost
[1:28:47] it ain't you
[1:28:49] it's him working and he may only use you
[1:28:51] one time
[1:28:53] one
[1:28:54] time
[1:28:56] but one time is enough
[1:28:59] all i need is one time with him
[1:29:01] i don't care i don't care what happens i
[1:29:03] don't care what goes
[1:29:04] if he uses me one time to save one soul
[1:29:07] it's enough
[1:29:09] [Music]
[1:29:10] mothers you raise your children because
[1:29:12] that's what god told you to do
[1:29:14] it's enough
[1:29:16] it's everything
[1:29:19] let him hide himself on the inside of
[1:29:21] you would you stand there with us to see
