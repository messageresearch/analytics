[40:54] gracious lord jesus we come before you
[40:55] this evening with humble hearts lord
[40:57] that we're
[40:58] able to stand here behind this sacred
[41:00] desk and bring this word to this portion
[41:02] of your bride lord
[41:04] god i ask you come down tonight lord use
[41:06] me like you've never used me before as i
[41:08] yield my body to your service one more
[41:10] time father

[41:20] we pray
[41:20] amen second peter
[41:24] 3 and verse 9
[41:29] the lord is not slack concerning his
[41:32] promise
[41:33] as some men count slackness but is
[41:35] long-suffering to us word
[41:38] not willing that any should perish but
[41:40] that all
[41:41] should come to repentance amen have your
[41:44] seats this evening
[41:46] i want to speak to you this evening for
[41:47] just the next little bit by the help of
[41:49] the lord on a promise keeping god
[41:52] now if any people know about the
[41:55] promises of god it's full gospel
[41:56] lighthouse
[41:59] you've seen so many miracles and you're
[42:01] still seeing miracles
[42:03] uh i just sit back in in all
[42:06] at every time i watch one of your
[42:08] services at
[42:09] how god moves and it's not just in full
[42:12] gospel lighthouse
[42:13] it's in churches across the message
[42:16] across the world
[42:18] you know the the promise that the lord
[42:19] gave your pastor
[42:21] trust me and i'll use you like never
[42:23] before
[42:24] that was for brother ron but it's for
[42:26] the bride also
[42:28] i believe that with all my heart he's
[42:31] he's taken full advantage of that so we
[42:34] should take full advantage of that
[42:36] hey man i was sent the other day when i
[42:39] was uh
[42:40] i was preparing this thought i was
[42:41] sending a
[42:43] text from a friend of mine who what used
[42:46] to be a police officer in his chapel and
[42:48] still sends him
[42:49] little sermonettes as he calls them so i
[42:51] want to read this i thought it was very
[42:52] fitting
[42:54] he starts by quoting hebrew hebrews 11
[42:57] which says these all died in faith not
[43:00] having received the promises but having
[43:02] seen them afar
[43:03] off and were persuaded of them and
[43:05] embraced them and confessed that they
[43:06] were strangers and pilgrims
[43:08] on the earth he goes on to say is
[43:10] anything in
[43:11] anything harder in life than keeping
[43:13] promises making promises is easy
[43:15] keeping them is another matter for those
[43:18] who have children and he says here
[43:19] especially daughters
[43:20] they say i promise never to do that
[43:22] again dad and then flutter their eyes at
[43:24] you
[43:24] then of course you melt and say it's
[43:26] okay sadly everyone has broken a promise
[43:29] or at least not kept a promise as well
[43:31] as they would have intended
[43:33] i would like to think that it's more the
[43:35] latter i know our intentions
[43:37] for the most part are good we are just
[43:39] wanting to be people pleasers
[43:42] anybody else here like that or is it
[43:43] just me
[43:45] i say i'm gonna do something and then
[43:47] something comes up and i forget about it
[43:49] or
[43:50] something else takes my attention away
[43:51] brother jim and i don't get to it
[43:53] and that makes me look like a bad person
[43:54] in their eyes and i that's one of the
[43:56] worst feelings in the world to me is to
[43:57] look like a
[43:58] bad person in one of my friend's eyes
[44:02] but he goes on to say to the circle
[44:05] the way that we react to things and how
[44:07] we look at things can be traced back to
[44:09] our experiences
[44:11] to the circumstances that align our
[44:12] views or how we feel and our experience
[44:15] of breaking promises can perhaps lead us
[44:16] to wonder about god and his promises
[44:19] if we don't always keep ours does he
[44:22] we tend to look at god from a horizontal
[44:24] perspective rather than a vertical
[44:26] we are born into sin it's part of our
[44:27] nature but god is sinless
[44:30] he is perfect in every way the
[44:31] scriptures tell us and reveal
[44:33] many things about our god and keeping
[44:35] his promises is one of them
[44:37] god doesn't say okay i will walk with
[44:39] you and then all of a sudden he's gone
[44:41] he doesn't say you're forgiven and then
[44:43] throws it back in our face
[44:45] he's right there with us through all of
[44:46] the storms life has to throw at us
[44:48] stop and realize that god's promises are
[44:51] true and foundational
[44:53] we can build our life around and upon
[44:55] them and they will never let us stand we
[44:56] will never be let down
[44:58] know this god did not promise days
[45:00] without pain laughter
[45:01] or sorrows nor son but what he did
[45:04] promise
[45:05] was strengths for the day comfort for
[45:06] the tears and a lot for the way and he
[45:09] ends by saying you've got this
[45:11] and god's got you amen aren't you
[45:14] thankful that he's got us in the palm of
[45:16] his hand this evening amen going back to
[45:18] our
[45:19] original scripture reading the word
[45:20] slack it means
[45:22] decrease or reduce in intensity
[45:25] quantity or speed to work slowly or
[45:28] lazily
[45:30] i don't know about you but my god's not
[45:32] lazy
[45:33] he is you you know you look at your dad
[45:36] sometimes
[45:37] and i know all the girls and nathan look
[45:39] at brother jim and see how hard of a
[45:40] worker he is
[45:42] they don't say jim's lazy her dad's lazy
[45:45] you've never seen that man i've hardly
[45:47] ever seen him sitting still and when i
[45:48] do he's thinking about a job or doing
[45:50] something
[45:51] else keeping his mind sharp
[45:54] because he's not lazy he wants to get
[45:56] the job done
[45:58] and most people say well he takes
[45:59] forever no offense i love you
[46:02] but he takes he takes a while to do the
[46:04] job but when the job's done it's right
[46:07] and that can go to they can go to the
[46:08] spiritual too god may take a while
[46:11] to do the job but it's going to be done
[46:14] right
[46:14] you're not going to have to hire
[46:15] somebody else to come do it when jim
[46:17] noel does the job
[46:19] if you want a job done well call jim
[46:20] noel amen
[46:24] amen forgive my folly this evening but
[46:26] through the foolishness of preaching
[46:28] as they say the word promise means a
[46:31] declaration
[46:32] or assurance that one will do a
[46:34] particular thing
[46:35] or that a particular thing will happen
[46:37] if he's promised it
[46:39] it will happen it may not happen brother
[46:42] andrew when we want it to happen
[46:43] it may not happen how we want it to
[46:45] happen i know this is simple tonight but
[46:47] y'all are pulling so i'm preaching
[46:50] but it's going to happen brother justin
[46:52] it's going to happen
[46:54] amen ii peter 1 4 says whereby
[46:57] are given unto us exceeding great and
[47:00] precious promises
[47:02] that by these you might be partakers of
[47:05] the divine nature
[47:06] having escaped the corruption that is in
[47:08] the world through lust
[47:11] we have to get rid of things
[47:14] he's given us everything but in turn we
[47:17] have to get rid of everything
[47:19] in order to get what he has for us in
[47:22] order to get where
[47:23] we need to be we have to lay aside the
[47:26] weight of the world that does so easily
[47:28] easily beset us we have to lay aside the
[47:30] lust for money or the lust for a big
[47:32] house nice job or
[47:34] we have to lay aside the anxiety and the
[47:37] things
[47:38] like that that would weigh us down this
[47:40] evening
[47:41] we have to get rid of all that stuff
[47:43] clean ourselves out so that he can come
[47:44] and fill us
[47:45] fill us up again we have everything at
[47:49] our disposal
[47:50] we have a book of promises
[47:54] endless promises
[47:57] thousands upon thousands of promises
[48:01] will we ever use them all probably not
[48:05] but they're there if that situation
[48:07] arises brother william and we need that
[48:08] promise
[48:10] you know and in the message dr moses he
[48:14] he talks about moses having that
[48:15] medicine box with the brass serpent
[48:18] and everything we have need of every
[48:20] kind of medicine is right here
[48:22] this is our this is our medicine cabinet
[48:24] tonight
[48:26] second corinthians 1 and 20 says
[48:29] for all all the promises
[48:33] of god in him are ye and in him amen
[48:37] unto the glory of god by us not
[48:41] one quarter of the promises or
[48:43] three-fourths of the promises
[48:44] but all that word all is one of my
[48:47] favorite words it means all inclusive
[48:49] without exception every one
[48:53] the word yea is an affirmative answer
[48:56] and the word amen
[48:58] means so be it two positives
[49:01] in that right there if i close my bible
[49:04] now and we went home
[49:05] we could say we had church tonight just
[49:06] by that one scripture right there
[49:09] his all his promises are in in him
[49:12] are ye and in him amen
[49:17] affirmative so be it
[49:21] so when he tells you i've promised you
[49:24] that i'm going to heal your pastor of
[49:25] that cancer
[49:27] he means it it's an affirmative answer
[49:31] so be it we've already claimed that
[49:34] promise
[49:35] as i was talking to brother jim today
[49:37] about his experience
[49:40] he said i don't then brother ron's motto
[49:43] don't accept anything less than full
[49:44] victory
[49:46] that's what we're looking for tonight is
[49:49] full victory
[49:51] he don't give you half of his promises
[49:55] he gives you all his promises every
[49:57] single one
[50:01] brother branham tells the story of the
[50:03] well i was listening to brother billy
[50:05] paul's testimony a while back
[50:07] and one of my all-time favorite stories
[50:10] is when brother branham the little
[50:12] girl comes up
[50:13] and she has the box of shoes under her
[50:15] arm
[50:17] she walks up and says and he asked her
[50:19] what she has under her arm she says a
[50:20] box of shoes i'm walking out of here
[50:22] without these crutches
[50:25] so then he gets to a point where he says
[50:27] you go sit down there on the front row
[50:28] and i'll get back to you in a little bit
[50:31] so he begins to start praying for more
[50:32] people praying for more people and his
[50:34] brother don i believe it was was in the
[50:36] background
[50:37] and he started to think he started to
[50:38] let the devil get into thinking
[50:40] that he's forgot about this little girl
[50:45] and we all know the story all of a
[50:46] sudden he turns around and says i
[50:47] haven't forgotten her
[50:49] and he calls her back up and he says is
[50:51] your faith built up yet
[50:53] that's where we got to get tonight is to
[50:55] a point to where our faith
[50:57] matches our promise because once we get
[50:59] to the where the faith matches the
[51:00] promise
[51:01] it's going to happen it has to happen
[51:04] because he said it's going to happen
[51:06] when you think he's forgotten all about
[51:08] you my goodness
[51:10] when you think he's forgotten all about
[51:12] you and all of a sudden he comes to you
[51:14] so sister gabby i haven't forgotten you
[51:17] i haven't forgotten you
[51:20] he's just waiting for your faith to
[51:22] catch up to your promise
[51:25] john 10 verse 34 and 35 says jesus
[51:28] answer to them
[51:29] is it not written in your law i said ye
[51:31] are god's if he
[51:32] if he called them gods and to whom the
[51:34] word of god came
[51:36] and the scripture cannot be broken it
[51:39] cannot be broken
[51:42] nothing can be taken away from it
[51:47] he says it you can take it to the bank
[51:50] as the saying says
[51:51] you can take it to the bank cash that
[51:53] check because it's on the way
[51:56] and the message and then jesus came
[51:57] prophet god says listen at him
[51:59] watch his emotions oh how he wants to
[52:02] get
[52:03] the hearts tonight like that thy brother
[52:05] shall rise again he said talking about
[52:06] lazarus here
[52:08] listen to this beautiful young hebrew
[52:10] girl yea lord
[52:12] he will rise again in the resurrection
[52:13] in the last day
[52:15] now there never was a man able to say
[52:16] this before or since or never will be
[52:19] outside of him the bible said there was
[52:22] no beauty we should desire him
[52:24] probably a little fellow in stature he
[52:25] pulled his little shoulders up and said
[52:27] i am the resurrection in life he that
[52:29] believeth in me
[52:31] though he were dead yet he shall live
[52:32] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[52:35] believeth in me shall never die
[52:36] that was his eternal promise and he
[52:39] himself said the scriptures cannot be
[52:40] broken what consolation do we have then
[52:43] tonight
[52:43] when god said something and then he says
[52:46] where have you buried him
[52:47] when god says something it's going to
[52:49] happen and the prophet of god said if he
[52:51] would have just said
[52:52] come forth it would have been a general
[52:53] resurrection but he called him by name
[52:56] he's calling you by name tonight and
[52:58] telling you that your promise is on the
[53:00] way
[53:03] god don't tell you about your problems
[53:05] he tells you about his promises i
[53:07] believe
[53:07] i was talking brother andrew in the back
[53:09] i believe i got that from brother ron
[53:11] but that's just too good not to reap and
[53:13] use again
[53:14] but he don't sit around and tell you
[53:16] well you've got this going on and you've
[53:18] got this going on
[53:19] this and such and such and you've been
[53:21] to the doctor all these times and
[53:22] they're telling you there's no hope and
[53:24] your friends and family are telling you
[53:25] there's no hope he don't sit around and
[53:27] tell you about that
[53:28] he says i've told you i promised you in
[53:31] my word that by my stripes you were
[53:33] healed before the foundation of the
[53:34] world
[53:36] you've been healed since then you've
[53:38] just got to get that faith
[53:40] to meet that promise i've got more
[53:43] promises than i got problems
[53:45] oftentimes i used to i do have a a great
[53:48] aunt
[53:49] that would sit around every time you'd
[53:50] ask her how she was doing and she'd say
[53:52] well
[53:53] my arthritis is acting up or such and
[53:56] such happened to me today she was always
[53:57] she was never positive
[53:59] never positive but when you told her
[54:02] well we say
[54:03] we used to tell her well you got one
[54:05] good thing going for you
[54:06] jesus loves you and she'd kind of perk
[54:09] up a minute and then she'd go back to
[54:11] saying the same thing again but you have
[54:14] to trust god's promises
[54:16] even when you don't know the details
[54:18] when you don't know how he's going to
[54:19] work it out or when he's going to work
[54:20] it out
[54:21] he's going to work it out it's in his
[54:23] time not ours
[54:24] we can't sit around and well we sit
[54:26] around and wait on it but while we're
[54:28] waiting on it we're
[54:28] letting our faith build like that little
[54:30] girl sitting on the front row
[54:32] waiting to put on that new pair of shoes
[54:34] we got to get our faith to a point
[54:36] tonight
[54:37] to where it matches our promise so we
[54:39] could step into that promise
[54:44] i'm gonna testify a little bit it's all
[54:45] right that little
[54:47] fella sitting right back there in his
[54:49] nana's arms
[54:51] he was prayed for on august 7. brother
[54:54] owens told you all this but i'm going to
[54:55] tell you again i might go into a little
[54:56] more detail
[54:57] he was born prayed for we were prayed
[55:00] for on august
[55:01] 7th on a wednesday he was born
[55:05] a year to the day wednesday august 5th
[55:08] this was we were prayed for in 2019 he
[55:10] was born august of this year
[55:11] to a wednesday to down to the day
[55:15] and you can't tell me that ain't god you
[55:17] can't tell me that i think
[55:18] the promises of god we asked for a child
[55:22] and he gave it to us not only did he
[55:24] give it to us he made it a specific time
[55:26] he was due on the eighth on the saturday
[55:29] but god wanted him to come on wednesday
[55:31] for the purpose of his testimony now
[55:34] we're not done yet
[55:35] his testimony he's he's got such an
[55:37] awesome testimony for a little guy
[55:39] and i can't wait to he he's able to tell
[55:41] it he'll probably do a better job than i
[55:43] do
[55:44] but we look and see that he was born we
[55:48] ended up
[55:48] in charlotte at the nicu at levine's
[55:51] children hospital
[55:52] and if any of your kids ever have to be
[55:54] there i pray that they don't but that is
[55:55] the
[55:56] top-notch best hospital treats you like
[55:58] royalty when you go in there
[56:00] but we we were
[56:03] distraught as any new parent would be
[56:07] a kid just born and caitlyn hadn't even
[56:09] got to hold him i barely got to touch
[56:10] him
[56:11] and here he comes in the room in a box
[56:13] about this big all hooked up and ready
[56:16] to fly on a helicopter
[56:20] so we were naturally distraught calling
[56:21] everybody saying we all pray we all pray
[56:23] we're headed to charlotte don't know how
[56:24] long we're going to be there
[56:26] but y'all just pray with us but let me
[56:28] tell you how god works
[56:30] let me tell you how god works we got
[56:33] there
[56:34] he was immediately off the oxygen still
[56:37] had the feeding tube and
[56:38] and the iv because his blood sugar was
[56:40] kind of low so he had the iv
[56:42] and things for about three to four days
[56:44] i believe maybe a week
[56:47] and got rid of that and got kept the
[56:50] sugar up and they kept
[56:51] they kept wanting to want his sugar to
[56:54] crash so they could do some tests
[56:56] but i tell you the whole 28 days he was
[56:58] there his sugar never fell below 55
[57:02] because that's what they wanted to fall
[57:03] below 50. his sugar never fell below 55
[57:06] they had to actually
[57:08] make his sugar fall down to get the test
[57:09] they wanted because that's my god
[57:13] he's promised he's a miracle he promised
[57:16] sister caitlin and i that miracle
[57:17] sitting back there
[57:18] he's not going to take him away he may
[57:22] have you may have to go through some
[57:23] things but he's not going to take him
[57:26] away
[57:27] he uh we we kept battling with the
[57:31] the feeding tube they wanted him to eat
[57:33] but yet when he's getting pumped full of
[57:35] food all day he don't want to eat
[57:37] so that was the only thing that kept us
[57:38] there for probably
[57:40] 20 out of those 28 days
[57:43] in the meantime i never missed i only
[57:46] missed a week's worth of work
[57:49] never missed a bill no late payments
[57:53] well
[57:54] how do you do that because jehovah jireh
[57:57] my provider
[57:59] how do you do that brother nate because
[58:01] i put my trust in him
[58:03] i had a friend at work that said she
[58:05] woke up one morning and felt impressed
[58:07] to start a facebook fundraiser maybe
[58:10] many
[58:10] some of you donated to it and i
[58:11] appreciate you god richly bless you for
[58:13] it
[58:14] but in it was less than a month in
[58:18] maybe three weeks time god allowed that
[58:20] fundraiser to raise and i'm not bragging
[58:23] on me i'm bragging on god now
[58:24] i'm not bragging on because who who i
[58:26] may be or who i associate with
[58:28] well i am bragging on who i associate
[58:29] with but that that fundraiser was able
[58:32] to produce
[58:33] just about three dollars shy two or
[58:35] three dollar shot of six thousand
[58:37] dollars
[58:38] i never missed a payment i never kaitlyn
[58:41] sister caitlyn never missed a payment we
[58:42] never missed a
[58:43] bill we just bought a house right before
[58:45] he was born never missed a mortgage
[58:46] payment
[58:48] that is that is my god that is jehovah
[58:51] gyra this evening
[58:53] meanwhile we were thinking that they
[58:56] wouldn't let us
[58:57] go back home and come back and go back
[58:59] home and come back because of the covet
[59:00] stuff
[59:01] so we were fortunate enough to spend one
[59:05] night in a motel
[59:07] and had to pay for it one night out of
[59:09] the month
[59:10] and it was at a discounted price so out
[59:13] of one month
[59:15] i paid 45 dollars for a month's worth of
[59:17] room service
[59:18] room and board they they have programs
[59:22] through the hospital
[59:23] that uh would would pay for
[59:26] like a ronald mcdonald house is a
[59:28] wonderful thing we didn't have to pay
[59:30] for supper or breakfast the only time i
[59:33] had to pay for food the whole time i was
[59:34] there is if me and sister caitlin got
[59:36] out to get away for a little bit or
[59:38] or lunch every day i can say out of a
[59:41] month i probably spent maybe 200
[59:45] that's that's amazing i like numbers
[59:49] my my dad was as an accountant so i like
[59:51] numbers
[59:53] i'm not good at them but i like them but
[59:56] so so all these things started adding up
[59:58] sister caitlin and i looked the other
[1:00:00] day and they were
[1:00:01] they were breaking down on the ronald
[1:00:03] mcdonald facebook page there
[1:00:05] that uh what each day cost and it
[1:00:08] rounded to about 142 so that would have
[1:00:11] cost us over would you say twenty one
[1:00:13] hundred dollars
[1:00:15] twenty five hundred dollars for a month
[1:00:18] a month we stayed there
[1:00:21] ain't got good any good to give us so
[1:00:24] many blessings
[1:00:25] undeserving amen
[1:00:29] and now we have charlie back there and
[1:00:31] he's growing like a weed
[1:00:33] and we just give all the glory to god
[1:00:36] and
[1:00:37] we we're so thankful for his many
[1:00:40] blessings and
[1:00:42] if he does it for us how much more can
[1:00:45] he do it for all the rest of his
[1:00:46] children
[1:00:47] he's no respecter of persons tonight
[1:00:50] amen
[1:00:51] in the patriarch abraham brother branham
[1:00:54] says
[1:00:54] regardless of how unreal it seems
[1:00:58] how unnatural it seems to the natural
[1:01:00] mind yet god cannot make a promise
[1:01:02] that he is not big enough to take care
[1:01:04] of we believe that
[1:01:05] same thing today every true seed of
[1:01:08] abraham believes the same thing no
[1:01:09] matter what circumstances
[1:01:11] in how much knowledge we've accumulated
[1:01:13] how many things has happened
[1:01:15] how unnatural it is to the natural mind
[1:01:17] how foolish it is
[1:01:18] rather to the natural mind it doesn't
[1:01:20] make a bit of difference if god said so
[1:01:22] that's
[1:01:22] it and the seed of abraham are settled
[1:01:25] upon thus saith the lord
[1:01:26] that settles it his word

[1:05:46] where there's drink where we can be
[1:05:48] happy to run into the presence of god
[1:05:51] tonight
[1:05:52] because we have a promise the hour has
[1:05:54] come for us to make that decision
[1:05:57] the decision is on you god's done his
[1:05:59] part you know i told the church the
[1:06:01] other day i preached at home and
[1:06:02] and i told them about the book where the
[1:06:05] red fern grows
[1:06:07] i love that book because i used to
[1:06:08] hunt all the time when i was younger
[1:06:10] and skinnier and i talked about how
[1:06:13] the boy he goes and he trains his dogs
[1:06:15] and he takes him out to this big tree
[1:06:17] and he he chops and he chops and he
[1:06:20] chops till he can't chop no more
[1:06:21] and he says all right god i've done my
[1:06:24] part we do yours
[1:06:25] well he's saying to us tonight i've done
[1:06:27] my part you do yours
[1:06:29] i've done what i'm what i promised i'll
[1:06:31] do it's up to you
[1:06:34] to walk into the by faith into that
[1:06:36] promise tonight
[1:06:38] we look at the promise to abraham he had
[1:06:40] to wait 25 years
[1:06:43] i heard the prophet prophet today he
[1:06:45] said
[1:06:46] he had to wait all this time but he
[1:06:49] staggered not
[1:06:50] he didn't lose faith he kept going down
[1:06:53] to the store and buying diapers he kept
[1:06:54] going down to the kroger and buying
[1:06:55] diapers when they were on sale or
[1:06:57] booties or this and that maybe they were
[1:06:59] deteriorated by time
[1:07:01] isaac got here because they've been
[1:07:03] they've been in the closet so long
[1:07:05] but he went he went on anyway he went by
[1:07:08] faith walking by faith exercising his
[1:07:10] faith tonight
[1:07:12] he didn't sit around and and get fat on
[1:07:16] not on being lazy and not exercising his
[1:07:18] faith he was
[1:07:20] not physically fit he was spiritually
[1:07:22] fit he was
[1:07:24] he was in the promise he was walking in
[1:07:25] the promise every day
[1:07:27] he kept walking in the promise today's
[1:07:29] the day today's the day today's the day
[1:07:30] for 25 years
[1:07:32] sometimes we get mad when we have to
[1:07:33] wait three days
[1:07:37] what we get annoyed by god embraces
[1:07:40] to manifest that he is jehovah jireh
[1:07:45] he uses what annoys us
[1:07:48] to be able to work in a way
[1:07:51] where to us there seemeth to be no way
[1:07:54] we've prayed and we've cried and we've
[1:07:55] prayed
[1:07:56] and we've asked for god to intervene
[1:07:59] he's waiting he's got it but he's
[1:08:03] waiting
[1:08:04] what is he waiting on he's waiting on
[1:08:06] you
[1:08:07] to let go and let god he's waiting on
[1:08:10] your faith
[1:08:11] to build up to a level to build up to
[1:08:14] that level
[1:08:14] that abraham had now
[1:08:18] abraham didn't start out with all the
[1:08:20] faith in the world maybe that's why it
[1:08:22] took 25 years
[1:08:23] maybe he had may not have been his faith
[1:08:26] he may had to
[1:08:26] encourage sister sarah to get her faith
[1:08:28] up a little bit
[1:08:30] but he waited and he staggered none
[1:08:34] psalms 37 and 4 delight thyself also in
[1:08:36] the lord and he shall give thee
[1:08:38] the desires of thy heart excuse me a
[1:08:40] minute
[1:08:43] he will never leave you he's always
[1:08:46] there when your
[1:08:47] earthly friends have let you down
[1:08:52] if i had a million dollars that i got in
[1:08:54] the inheritance
[1:08:58] and i come down to brother shifflet
[1:08:59] right here and and uh
[1:09:01] told him that i was going to give him
[1:09:02] ten thousand dollars to do some home
[1:09:05] renovation projects or something
[1:09:07] and i'll don't shake his hand or
[1:09:09] anything i just said i'll get with you
[1:09:11] when i get the money it's you know it's
[1:09:12] going through the legal process and
[1:09:13] everything

[1:09:21] thousand dollars man i just bought a new
[1:09:24] hunting cabin
[1:09:26] and a new hunting lease and i really
[1:09:28] don't have it i'm sorry i forgot
[1:09:31] you think he's gonna think highly of me
[1:09:33] then
[1:09:35] i don't think so i'd be pretty upset
[1:09:38] at least invite me hunting in your new
[1:09:39] hunting cabin or your new hunting land
[1:09:43] but god's not that way tonight
[1:09:46] he's going to come down and he'll he'll
[1:09:48] shake your hand
[1:09:49] and he'll tell you brother andrew i've
[1:09:52] got what you got need of
[1:09:54] it's yours you can have it i promise
[1:09:58] amen hebrews 13 5 says let your
[1:10:01] conversation be without covetousness
[1:10:03] and be content with such things as you
[1:10:06] have
[1:10:07] for he has said i will never leave thee
[1:10:09] nor forsake thee
[1:10:11] he's always there even when
[1:10:14] nobody else is he's always there like i
[1:10:17] said i know this is simple tonight but i
[1:10:19] hope it's a blessing
[1:10:20] deuteronomy 31 and 8 and the lord he
[1:10:24] and the lord he it is that doeth doth go
[1:10:27] before thee
[1:10:28] and he will be with thee and he will not
[1:10:30] fail thee neither forsake thee
[1:10:32] fear not neither be dismayed don't be
[1:10:34] discouraged tonight
[1:10:37] even when you don't see him he's working
[1:10:39] even when you don't feel him he's
[1:10:40] working
[1:10:42] he's always working like i said at the
[1:10:44] beginning he's not a lazy god
[1:10:46] he don't sit around and say well i'll
[1:10:48] let somebody else do it michael will you
[1:10:50] go do that gabriel will you go do that
[1:10:53] he's an ever present god in our times of
[1:10:56] trouble
[1:10:57] in our times of joy in our times of
[1:10:59] grief he's always
[1:11:01] right there he's never too far away
[1:11:05] he never leaves us sometimes we get away
[1:11:07] from him but he's still there waiting on
[1:11:09] us to come back to the spot where we
[1:11:10] left him
[1:11:12] he tells us in his word over and over
[1:11:14] again how to get what we have need of
[1:11:17] and it's simple
[1:11:18] john 14-13 says and whatsoever ye shall
[1:11:20] ask in my name
[1:11:22] that will i do that the father may be
[1:11:24] glorified in the son
[1:11:26] if you shall ask anything some things
[1:11:30] if you shall ask some things in my name
[1:11:32] i might do it
[1:11:38] can you clean these for me i don't know
[1:11:40] i don't know if i read that right
[1:11:43] i'm sorry i'm joe green's son if you
[1:11:45] shall ask
[1:11:46] anything in my name i will
[1:11:50] do it not i'll think about it or i'll
[1:11:53] get back to you
[1:11:54] you know sister caitlin always asked me
[1:11:55] if i would get ready to do something
[1:11:57] she's like you want to do such and such
[1:11:58] or
[1:11:58] do this or can we do this and i'll say
[1:12:00] i'll pray about it
[1:12:02] and nine times out of ten if i can get
[1:12:03] out of it that means no
[1:12:06] but i'll tell her i'll pray about it
[1:12:08] it's hard being a preacher is why i
[1:12:09] fainted sweetheart
[1:12:12] john 15 and 16 says you have not chosen
[1:12:15] me
[1:12:16] but i have chosen you and ordained you
[1:12:18] that you should
[1:12:20] that you should go and bring forth fruit
[1:12:21] and that your fruit should remain
[1:12:23] and that whatsoever ye ask shall
[1:12:25] whatever whatsoever ye shall ask of the
[1:12:27] father in my name
[1:12:29] he may give it to you
[1:12:32] when you need comfort he's promised to
[1:12:34] be your comforter
[1:12:36] when you need a friend he's promised to
[1:12:38] be that friend you know brother andrew
[1:12:40] was one of my best friends in the whole
[1:12:41] wide world
[1:12:42] but there's times where brother andrew
[1:12:44] is dealing with other things and i
[1:12:45] call him up and he's like i'll call you
[1:12:47] back later or or maybe
[1:12:49] uh i can't talk right now but when i
[1:12:51] need a friend that i know i can count on
[1:12:53] and most of the time i can count on
[1:12:55] brother andrew there's not been many
[1:12:56] times that i haven't been able to count
[1:12:57] on him
[1:12:59] even when he tells me things i don't
[1:13:00] want to hear
[1:13:02] that's a that's a different story for a
[1:13:04] different day but
[1:13:06] he's always there he always picks up the
[1:13:09] phone as it were
[1:13:10] he'll always he'll never put you on hold
[1:13:12] or say i'll call you back
[1:13:14] he's always got to listen in here and a
[1:13:16] shoulder to cry on
[1:13:18] john 14-18 i will not leave you
[1:13:20] comfortless
[1:13:21] i will come to you we don't have to try
[1:13:24] to make it to him
[1:13:25] he will come to us when we're in need of
[1:13:29] comfort when we're in need of healing
[1:13:30] when we're in need of
[1:13:32] of uplifting he comes to us
[1:13:35] whether it be through a church service
[1:13:37] much like this one
[1:13:38] or somebody calling you on the phone or
[1:13:40] sending you a text message saying i love
[1:13:42] you i'm praying for you or
[1:13:43] whatever it is that you have need of in
[1:13:45] that moment god knows
[1:13:47] he knows how to come down and tell you
[1:13:50] just exactly what you've had on your
[1:13:52] heart
[1:13:54] and we know that back back when before
[1:13:58] all the computerized and all the things
[1:14:00] happen
[1:14:01] if you made a man a promise you shook
[1:14:03] his hand
[1:14:05] and that handshake as the saying is a
[1:14:08] man's word is his bond
[1:14:10] if you shake that if you shake his hand
[1:14:12] that means
[1:14:13] that you promised to do something
[1:14:17] and you better hold up your end of the
[1:14:18] bargain
[1:14:20] isaiah 41-13 says for i the lord thy god
[1:14:24] will hold thy right hand saying unto
[1:14:26] thee fear not
[1:14:28] i will help thee tonight we just need to
[1:14:31] slip our hand into his and trust him
[1:14:35] not slip our hands into man's hand
[1:14:39] but put our hand in god's hand a man's
[1:14:42] word is his bond i know where this is
[1:14:43] covered but i'm gonna shake your hand
[1:14:44] tonight
[1:14:47] i promise you brother andrew whatever
[1:14:49] you have need of
[1:14:50] whatever it is it's yours i've gave you
[1:14:53] the promise in my word
[1:14:55] whatever you have need of amen claim it
[1:14:57] just now
[1:14:59] amen i'm gonna tell you how easy that is
[1:15:03] i was ministering at home there on
[1:15:05] sunday and god began to deal with things
[1:15:08] and we had a we have a sister in our
[1:15:10] church and her husband i if i called her
[1:15:12] name you would know who they are
[1:15:13] and they may be listening and not
[1:15:17] she desire they desire a child they've
[1:15:19] been married
[1:15:20] 16 years tomorrow and they've had some
[1:15:23] miscarriages and so forth
[1:15:25] and they desire a child so on sunday i
[1:15:28] was ministering at church
[1:15:30] and i was kind of preaching along these
[1:15:33] same lines and i did that same example
[1:15:34] and i walked around the different ones
[1:15:36] and
[1:15:36] and was saying things to him and i
[1:15:38] walked to her
[1:15:40] and i can't exactly remember what i said
[1:15:42] but it was something about hannah
[1:15:44] i said hannah hannah prayed
[1:15:47] and she prayed and it seemed like she
[1:15:50] was not getting anywhere
[1:15:51] and then that last time she prayed she
[1:15:53] got through to god
[1:15:55] i shook her hand and i told her it's
[1:15:57] coming well unbeknownst to me
[1:16:00] at the same time my dad was preaching 50
[1:16:01] miles away in hendersonville
[1:16:03] and he was talking about the promise of
[1:16:05] abraham
[1:16:07] and another brother that goes to our
[1:16:08] church was there with his wife
[1:16:11] and he said as soon as dad said that
[1:16:14] abraham's promise wasn't just for
[1:16:16] abraham was for us to
[1:16:17] he said the lord began to show him
[1:16:19] getting a prayer cloth out of his wallet
[1:16:20] that nobody has ever
[1:16:22] touched he's never gave it to anybody
[1:16:23] it's a piece of brother brandon's
[1:16:25] pillowcase so he said i saw myself
[1:16:28] getting this prayer cloth out of my
[1:16:30] wallet
[1:16:30] and taking it up to the front to be
[1:16:31] prayed for to give to this sister
[1:16:35] because god showed me that it's getting
[1:16:37] time you know
[1:16:39] so he did that and then they met him up
[1:16:41] afterwards and
[1:16:42] and they they went to eat together and
[1:16:45] he gave her this this prayer cloth and
[1:16:47] he said he told her i want it back in 10
[1:16:49] months
[1:16:50] he said i'll give you extra month but i
[1:16:51] want it back in 10 months
[1:16:54] so they begin to converse about the
[1:16:56] things that happened
[1:16:58] and they were telling what happened at
[1:17:01] our church and they
[1:17:02] and they were telling what happened
[1:17:03] there at the other assembly
[1:17:05] and they ate their lunch and they went
[1:17:08] outside in a parking lot and
[1:17:09] the brother felt led to pray so he began
[1:17:12] to pray and he told
[1:17:13] this brother to put the prayer cloth on
[1:17:14] his wife's stomach
[1:17:16] they began to pray and then after they
[1:17:18] were done she told him of a dream that
[1:17:19] she had
[1:17:20] that my wife was in the nursery with
[1:17:22] charlie and his wife was in the nursery
[1:17:24] with a new baby and this other sister
[1:17:26] was there as well
[1:17:28] well we were rejoicing in things and
[1:17:30] then the brother called me that evening
[1:17:32] he said i got to tell you something
[1:17:33] i said what's that i said i can hardly
[1:17:35] stand anymore i feel like enoch i'm
[1:17:37] about to take a
[1:17:38] take a rapture and he said
[1:17:41] he said i was i was getting brow beat by
[1:17:43] the devil just sitting here on the couch
[1:17:44] you know how he does after a good
[1:17:46] service
[1:17:47] he don't even wait till monday morning
[1:17:48] anymore he'll get you as soon as you
[1:17:49] walk out of the church doors
[1:17:51] but he'll he started browbeating him and
[1:17:53] make trying to make him doubt
[1:17:55] and he simply said god help me and he
[1:17:58] said all of a sudden
[1:17:59] the lord started showing him this dream
[1:18:00] that the sister had
[1:18:02] and then while he was showing him this
[1:18:04] dream
[1:18:05] he said the lord asked him the question
[1:18:08] why do you think this sister was in the
[1:18:09] nursery with your wife and sister
[1:18:11] caitlin
[1:18:14] i would say who knows but god knows it's
[1:18:17] on the way the promises
[1:18:19] is on the way i was listening to your
[1:18:21] pastor today from this past sunday
[1:18:23] i believe brother andrew said it at the
[1:18:25] end of the service we're seeing miracles
[1:18:28] we're seeing more miracles now than we
[1:18:30] have ever before
[1:18:32] some of us maybe some of you older ones
[1:18:34] and the veterans that are in here that
[1:18:36] have seen these things over the years
[1:18:37] but
[1:18:38] it's time now that these miracles are
[1:18:40] starting to take place again
[1:18:43] you have to trust his process this is
[1:18:45] saying goes trust the process
[1:18:47] you put your faith in his process not
[1:18:50] the faith in the preacher's process or
[1:18:51] your neighbor's process
[1:18:54] because they can pray with you but he's
[1:18:56] the only one that can answer that prayer
[1:18:59] he's the only one that we need to put
[1:19:00] our faith in yes it's good to have faith
[1:19:02] in your pastors
[1:19:04] because they lead you they shepherd you
[1:19:06] but put
[1:19:07] all your faith in his process
[1:19:12] matthew 24 and 35 says
[1:19:15] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[1:19:18] words
[1:19:18] shall not pass away i quoted it earlier
[1:19:21] a man's word is his bond
[1:19:23] and god's word has an even stronger bond
[1:19:25] than that
[1:19:27] you know when you weld two pieces of
[1:19:28] metal together if the weld's good and
[1:19:30] strong
[1:19:31] it takes a lot of pressure it takes a
[1:19:34] lot of pressure
[1:19:36] before that that metal will break but i
[1:19:39] can tell you right now the devil can
[1:19:40] throw all his sledgehammers
[1:19:42] he can throw all his sawzalls he can
[1:19:44] throw everything he's got at it tonight
[1:19:46] but this bond's better than loctite
[1:19:48] brother matthew
[1:19:50] this bond between god and his bride
[1:19:53] is a million times stronger you can't
[1:19:56] even put it on a number
[1:19:58] how much stronger the bond of jesus
[1:20:00] christ
[1:20:01] and his bride is gorilla glue ain't got
[1:20:04] nothing on this
[1:20:05] duct tape ain't even got nothing on this
[1:20:07] and that's stronger than gorilla glue
[1:20:08] sometimes
[1:20:10] the power of a promise like we said
[1:20:14] if if i promise you something and you
[1:20:17] know that i'm a man of my word
[1:20:19] you hold me to that promise you hold me
[1:20:23] to that standard of being a man of my
[1:20:24] word
[1:20:26] but i'm a human and as a song says
[1:20:29] humans forget
[1:20:32] now you can remind me and i may forget
[1:20:34] again
[1:20:35] and you keep reminding me that i may
[1:20:37] forget again
[1:20:38] but when we go to him and tell him what
[1:20:42] we have need of
[1:20:44] we don't have to ask him anymore we can
[1:20:46] remind him every now and again god i
[1:20:47] know you're working on this
[1:20:49] it's there you know you look at
[1:20:51] something you order something and you
[1:20:52] look at the tracking number
[1:20:54] and you track that thing every day is
[1:20:56] there is there any progress
[1:20:58] is there is it when's it gonna be here
[1:21:00] i'm i'm an amazon prime junkie
[1:21:02] when's it gonna be here i need it two
[1:21:04] days ago
[1:21:06] and sister caitlin gets me every time
[1:21:09] i've told her that i'm gonna quit but
[1:21:12] i'm a human and humans forget
[1:21:14] most of them now it's hunting stuff
[1:21:16] because it's hunting season and she
[1:21:18] asked me the other day
[1:21:19] she said when is this money spending
[1:21:21] going to quit
[1:21:23] and then i look over her and she's
[1:21:24] checking the paypal invoice off i said
[1:21:25] when is this money
[1:21:26] this money spending gonna quit
[1:21:31] hebrews 10 and 23 says let us hold fast
[1:21:33] to the profession of our faith
[1:21:35] without wavering for he is faithful
[1:21:38] that promised he is faithful
[1:21:42] that promised the word faithful
[1:21:46] it means you ain't got to worry about if
[1:21:48] he's going to do it or not
[1:21:50] that's a redneck definition there and
[1:21:52] that ain't webster that's redneck you
[1:21:54] ain't got to worry
[1:21:55] about if he's going to do it if he's
[1:21:57] going to keep his word
[1:21:59] he's already kept his word like we said
[1:22:02] he's just waiting on you
[1:22:04] to keep your end of the bargain
[1:22:08] and the message of the reaction to an
[1:22:10] action
[1:22:12] and if and if you're sure that you're
[1:22:14] born of the spirit of god that you have
[1:22:15] the holy ghost
[1:22:16] and that the promises of god is yours i
[1:22:19] don't care what the devil does
[1:22:20] you can still rest assure faith takes
[1:22:22] its unmovable stand
[1:22:24] faith cannot rest upon the shifting sins
[1:22:26] of man's theology
[1:22:27] but it takes its solemn stand on the
[1:22:29] rock of ages which is unmovable
[1:22:31] there it rests with assurance no matter
[1:22:33] what comes or goes
[1:22:35] my faith holds how sick i get how
[1:22:38] contrary it looks how this is my faith
[1:22:40] is anchored within the veil and nothing
[1:22:42] can move me
[1:22:43] my faith is anchored in the rock
[1:22:46] my faith can't be broken
[1:22:51] sometimes i feel like i don't have the
[1:22:54] strongest faith
[1:22:56] but i look back in his word again i look
[1:22:59] back at all the promises
[1:23:02] this this little black back book right
[1:23:04] here
[1:23:05] is chock full of promises
[1:23:10] his promises are in him yea and in him
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:13] that means it's already done that means
[1:23:16] it's already been fulfilled
[1:23:18] you just have to wait you just have to
[1:23:20] get into that
[1:23:21] channel of faith to where you can step
[1:23:24] into that promise
[1:23:26] you know brother ron is getting to that
[1:23:28] point in his faith
[1:23:29] to where he's going to step into that
[1:23:30] new body he's going to step into that
[1:23:32] cancer-free body
[1:23:33] and i don't believe it's gonna be much
[1:23:35] longer he's gonna step right into that
[1:23:37] cancer-free body
[1:23:38] and we're gonna see brother ron preach
[1:23:40] like he did on sunday
[1:23:42] every service i thought he preached good
[1:23:45] when we were here the last time until i
[1:23:46] watched that today
[1:23:48] man i'm talking about preach like
[1:23:51] like brother ron preaches it was just
[1:23:55] awesome to see that god is building his
[1:23:57] strength every day
[1:23:59] god is building your strength every day
[1:24:01] your spiritual strength
[1:24:03] and if you need it your physical
[1:24:05] strength you just have to put your trust
[1:24:07] in him
[1:24:09] no matter how bleak the situation looks
[1:24:11] to us he has promised to help us
[1:24:14] and he can't break that no matter how
[1:24:16] hard the devil tries to throw things at
[1:24:18] you like well
[1:24:19] he ain't done it yet he ain't gonna do
[1:24:22] it if he ain't done it yet
[1:24:24] you know he's supposed to work like this
[1:24:27] sometimes he says yes
[1:24:29] sometimes he says no other times he says
[1:24:31] wait a while
[1:24:33] when he says wait a while you know what
[1:24:34] he's waiting on he's waiting on us
[1:24:37] he's waiting on us to get to that point
[1:24:39] like we talked about the whole service
[1:24:40] he's waiting on us to get to that point
[1:24:43] to where our faith
[1:24:45] outweighs our problems
[1:24:49] those circumstances will this brother
[1:24:50] branham again and be certain of god 1959
[1:24:53] those circumstances will seem to fall
[1:24:55] from right and left but that faith never
[1:24:57] moves
[1:24:58] because you're certain that he's god and
[1:25:00] if he's god he keeps his promise
[1:25:02] he can't make a promise and break it if
[1:25:04] he's god he's got to keep his promise oh
[1:25:06] i love that he's got to stay with it
[1:25:09] he's not an indian giver you know i had
[1:25:12] to
[1:25:12] when i was little i used to play with my
[1:25:14] cousins and stuff and we trade toys
[1:25:16] back and forth all the time well i got a
[1:25:19] little
[1:25:19] action figure and by the time i got home
[1:25:22] her mom was calling my mom saying
[1:25:24] she wants it back she gave it to me
[1:25:27] she told me i could have it she never
[1:25:28] played with it but once i got once i
[1:25:30] took it away
[1:25:31] and took it to my house to play with it
[1:25:33] she wanted it back
[1:25:36] god's not like that tonight no it wasn't
[1:25:39] katie
[1:25:40] it wasn't katie
[1:25:43] katie i'd give spending with katie and
[1:25:45] she'd just leave me in the room by
[1:25:46] myself and don't even worry about it
[1:25:50] but god's not like that tonight when he
[1:25:54] gives you something he's not taking it
[1:25:55] back
[1:25:58] again forgive my folly tonight he's not
[1:26:01] taking it back
[1:26:03] whatever he gives you it's yours
[1:26:06] whatever he gives us
[1:26:07] it's ours we don't have to say well
[1:26:10] you can borrow it but i want it back
[1:26:12] brother gabe if i gave you my hunting
[1:26:14] rifle to borrow to go hunting
[1:26:15] i want it back don't get any scratches
[1:26:17] on it but he gives it to you and it's
[1:26:22] yours
[1:26:22] you don't want it he don't ask for it
[1:26:24] back he don't ask for it back
[1:26:27] satan is going to try every way he can
[1:26:29] to destroy your testimony that god is
[1:26:30] working on
[1:26:32] but he can't do anything like brother
[1:26:34] ron preached on sunday you can't stop
[1:26:36] it you can't stop it once that faith is
[1:26:39] in motion
[1:26:40] that faith is in action you can't stop
[1:26:42] it
[1:26:45] in the power of the devil brother
[1:26:46] branham says the devil's nothing but a
[1:26:47] bluff anyhow snorting and blowing all
[1:26:49] thunder and no lightning
[1:26:50] but i tell you brother the lightning
[1:26:52] power of the resurrected jesus christ
[1:26:54] puts a reality there that shocks the
[1:26:55] soul from a dead slumber
[1:26:57] of these earthly bound things into the
[1:26:58] immortal realms to believe god
[1:27:00] and take him at his word and call those
[1:27:02] things which are not as though they were
[1:27:04] amen
[1:27:05] redeemed by the blood of the lamb called
[1:27:07] out set aside a church
[1:27:08] bought and washed and ironed out without
[1:27:10] spot or wrinkle
[1:27:12] that's what he's coming for god help us
[1:27:15] to get our faith in the right place to
[1:27:16] not move out on the battlegrounds there
[1:27:18] and say
[1:27:18] satan you're a liar jesus christ died to
[1:27:21] make me free and it's mine
[1:27:23] get out of here i can tell him that
[1:27:25] tonight
[1:27:26] it's mine get out of here why do we hold
[1:27:30] back
[1:27:30] when he's promised us everything why do
[1:27:32] we continue to worry and fret
[1:27:35] and get overwhelmed we let
[1:27:38] the naysayers come in and sit on our pew
[1:27:41] and tell us that well
[1:27:42] god did it for somebody else but he's
[1:27:43] not going to do it for you
[1:27:45] or we let our neighbors say
[1:27:48] well why are you still believing that it
[1:27:50] had happened yet you've been waiting for
[1:27:52] 15 16 years for it to happen
[1:27:54] why why are you why have you not given
[1:27:56] up
[1:27:57] because my faith won't let me give up my
[1:28:00] faith in him
[1:28:02] and whom i put my trust and my faith he
[1:28:05] won't let me
[1:28:06] it won't let me give up no matter how
[1:28:09] hard i want to give up
[1:28:11] no matter how hard i want to quit trying
[1:28:12] and just throw in the towel as it were
[1:28:14] and sit down and not do anything my
[1:28:17] faith
[1:28:18] and my trust and my god won't let me
[1:28:23] and hear ye him he says upon such a word
[1:28:27] as that i wonder
[1:28:28] this afternoon our listeners how can we
[1:28:30] be so petty then and dilatory about
[1:28:31] reaching out and taking hold of the
[1:28:33] promises of god
[1:28:34] when he gave us this blessed promise to
[1:28:36] his church i'll be with you even in you
[1:28:38] till the end of the age
[1:28:39] and then we set along as if god never
[1:28:41] said it whatsoever you bind
[1:28:43] in earth i'll bind it in heaven what you
[1:28:46] loose on the earth i'll loose it in
[1:28:47] heaven
[1:28:48] whether it's sickness whether it's
[1:28:49] disease whether it's whatever it is
[1:28:51] god gave this blessed promise and it's
[1:28:54] our privilege to pick up this promise
[1:28:55] and use it
[1:28:57] it's our privilege you know they say
[1:29:00] driving is a privilege
[1:29:01] you when you're in school you can get
[1:29:03] your license taken or your permit taken
[1:29:05] away for bad grades
[1:29:07] but he's not going to take it away
[1:29:10] it's a pretty it's a privilege but it's
[1:29:12] a privilege that we get to use
[1:29:13] all the time if we'll use it but that's
[1:29:16] the thing
[1:29:18] we got all the tools brother jim what
[1:29:20] would it be if your tools set in the
[1:29:22] shed all the time and you didn't use
[1:29:23] them
[1:29:24] what good would they be they'd just be
[1:29:26] collecting dust and
[1:29:27] and you'd be losing money but if you put
[1:29:31] those tools to use in the trade
[1:29:34] they don't they they're rewarding over
[1:29:36] and over again they pay for themselves
[1:29:38] as it said this is paid for itself over
[1:29:40] and over again
[1:29:42] it's paid for itself with healing it's
[1:29:44] paid for itself with salvation
[1:29:46] it's paid for itself with deliverance
[1:29:48] it's paid for itself with whatever
[1:29:51] you have need of he paid
[1:29:54] the ultimate price for it it's already
[1:29:57] paid for
[1:29:58] the tools are already paid for we just
[1:30:00] got to put them to use
[1:30:03] you know this this next verse here
[1:30:07] it says many o lord my god are thy
[1:30:09] wonderful works
[1:30:10] which thou has done and thy thoughts
[1:30:12] which are to us word
[1:30:14] they cannot be reckoned up in order unto
[1:30:15] thee i would declare and speak of them
[1:30:18] they are more than can be numbered i
[1:30:20] can't put a number on how many times
[1:30:22] i've been blessed
[1:30:23] i can't put a number on how many times
[1:30:25] he's met my needs i can't put a number
[1:30:27] on how many promises that he's kept
[1:30:31] there's no end to the promises that he's
[1:30:33] given us
[1:30:34] we can't even begin to fathom what he's
[1:30:37] given us
[1:30:38] and there won't be enough time when we
[1:30:40] get over there to thank him we'll thank
[1:30:42] him for a million years and we'll still
[1:30:43] be thanking him
[1:30:45] we'll thank him for all eternity and it
[1:30:47] still won't be enough
[1:30:48] for what he's done for us we'll thank
[1:30:50] him throughout the endless ages
[1:30:53] but we still will still be thanking him
[1:30:56] over and over again when i get there
[1:31:00] y'all gonna have to wait in line because
[1:31:01] you're gonna be behind me and i'm gonna
[1:31:02] spend the first ten thousand years with
[1:31:04] him thanking him
[1:31:04] just starting to thank him and then i'll
[1:31:06] let somebody else i'll come back later
[1:31:08] and thank him again in the message
[1:31:12] then jesus came and called brother brown
[1:31:14] says is he identified among you enough
[1:31:16] that you can accept him do you believe
[1:31:18] he's here
[1:31:19] you believe that that's him friends if i
[1:31:21] could come down there in that audience
[1:31:23] and heal any one of any of you people
[1:31:24] i'd sure do it i would gladly do it with
[1:31:26] all my heart
[1:31:27] i would do it but i can't do that i
[1:31:29] don't have any way of doing it
[1:31:31] but the only thing i have is this little
[1:31:33] gift that i was showing you and that
[1:31:34] identifies the scripture promise that
[1:31:36] jesus christ is right here with us
[1:31:38] keeping his promise oh that ought to set
[1:31:40] our hearts on fire my
[1:31:41] just think of jesus that wonderful name
[1:31:44] i just think that he's here right now
[1:31:46] he's here right now brother greg if i
[1:31:48] got to come down and give you what you
[1:31:49] had need of i'd do it it's like the
[1:31:50] prophet said
[1:31:51] but i can't because he's already done it
[1:31:54] you just have to have the faith
[1:31:56] build up to that point to where you can
[1:31:58] step into it
[1:31:59] i keep repeating that but i'm trying to
[1:32:01] drive a point home there
[1:32:03] this verse here this in psalms 34 3 and
[1:32:06] 8
[1:32:06] it tells us what to do i believe you
[1:32:09] read it the other night
[1:32:10] i tried to sing it but i can't sing it
[1:32:14] oh magnify the lord with me and let us
[1:32:17] exalt his name together
[1:32:19] i sought the lord and he heard me and he
[1:32:21] delivered me from all my fears
[1:32:23] they looked unto him and were lightened
[1:32:25] and their faces were not ashamed
[1:32:27] this is my verse right here this poor
[1:32:29] man cried
[1:32:30] and the lord heard me and saved him out
[1:32:33] of
[1:32:33] half of his troubles all
[1:32:36] of his troubles the angel of the lord
[1:32:39] encampeth are
[1:32:40] around about them that fear him fear him
[1:32:42] and delivered them o taste and see that
[1:32:44] the lord is good
[1:32:46] blessed is the man that trusteth in him
[1:32:49] he's given us all these prop promises
[1:32:51] not problems
[1:32:52] he's given us everything we have need of
[1:32:56] like i said not when we need it or when
[1:32:58] we think we need it
[1:33:00] but when he knows for a fact that we
[1:33:02] need it
[1:33:03] we think we need it right now we think
[1:33:04] we need it yesterday
[1:33:06] but he knows exactly when and where and
[1:33:08] what time we need it
[1:33:10] and he's there to give it to us at that
[1:33:12] specific time and not a minute before or
[1:33:14] a minute after
[1:33:15] and i'm preaching to myself here because
[1:33:17] i'm one of the most impatient people
[1:33:18] you'll ever meet
[1:33:20] i'm a green and that runs in the blood i
[1:33:23] i'm a i don't like to wait i like to be
[1:33:26] on time
[1:33:27] i like to get there so i know that i'm
[1:33:30] if it's
[1:33:31] at a restaurant i like to get a good
[1:33:32] seat or if i'm going somewhere
[1:33:34] where i have to get a good seat maybe in
[1:33:35] church or something i want to get there
[1:33:38] so that i can get there and make sure
[1:33:41] that i'm there i don't want to run in at
[1:33:43] the last minute if i can help it
[1:33:45] but now he's telling us here that i've
[1:33:47] give you all these and he gives us the
[1:33:49] instructions here
[1:33:50] to magnify his name to praise him with
[1:33:52] everything that was within us
[1:33:54] because that's what we were created to
[1:33:56] do
[1:33:57] we can sing praises that the angels
[1:33:59] can't even dream about singing
[1:34:01] we were made we were created to praise
[1:34:04] him
[1:34:06] and we have the right to praise him
[1:34:09] because
[1:34:09] he's done so much for us even if he's
[1:34:11] only done two or three things for you
[1:34:13] that's more than enough that's more than
[1:34:15] we deserve
[1:34:16] i know each and every one of us sitting
[1:34:18] here tonight have had promise after
[1:34:20] promise miracle after miracle
[1:34:22] this and that after that that he's done
[1:34:25] for us
[1:34:26] and we know that he is the same
[1:34:29] yesterday today and forever
[1:34:31] so if he did it for somebody over here
[1:34:33] yesterday and he's going to do it for
[1:34:34] somebody out here
[1:34:35] he can do it for you right now if it's
[1:34:37] your time if you've stepped into that
