[24:33] hose
[24:34] and you got to take your right hand and
[24:36] bend that hose back and come down

[24:38] and it was just causing a really bad
[24:41] pain right through there
[24:43] I kind of knowed what it was but I
[24:44] wasn't going to speak that language and
[24:45] I spoke with yet today
[24:48] but about a month or maybe longer ago
[24:51] Jenny too suffered in the same hand same
[24:54] pain
[24:55] going through what I've been going
[24:56] through and we've sitting there one
[24:58] night watching a sermon and as it went
[24:59] off
[25:01] just felt I said Jenny we ain't got to
[25:04] live like this

[25:19] and we're going to believe
[25:21] well that night it didn't get better

[25:38] when it quit
[25:40] but brother Donnie was telling he said
[25:42] you know when we go to get that healing
[25:44] sometimes it's so much easier if we can
[25:46] feel it right then but when she prayed
[25:48] that night I mean this that I'm talking
[25:50] about it would hurt not just at work it
[25:52] got to where it would hurt just being

[49:15] it's a very special day for myself and
[49:18] this is the anniversary of when I was
[49:20] burned and
[49:23] we know what a miracle that took place
[49:25] a few weeks later
[49:27] and for those that don't know
[49:30] the doctors had give up and
[49:33] and they had already said
[49:35] non-responsive for 36 hours and
[49:39] brother miskel had felt led of the Lord
[49:41] to call Sister Con in
[49:45] that I would be the speaker at the next
[49:47] year's camp meeting and the speaker she
[49:51] held onto those words
[49:53] and the Lord had dealt with him
[49:56] in a very early morning
[49:59] God spoke to him what a moment that was
[50:02] and he relayed that to Sister Connie
[50:05] and she would hear many times that no
[50:08] way he could live
[50:11] for God had greater purpose
[50:15] God had greater purpose and they were
[50:18] going to harvest my organs in five hours
[50:20] and
[50:21] and today is an anniversary and we look
[50:24] back on it and brother Tim Pruitt came
[50:27] that weekend and spoke to you God will
[50:30] have a testimony
[50:34] I'm sure when he stepped to the stage
[50:36] that day and myself being non-responsive
[50:40] the devil was whispering in his ears
[50:43] you preached that sermon and he dies
[50:46] it's going to look bad
[50:49] it's going to look bad but God knows how
[50:51] to put his servant in a spot
[50:54] and he's not you know he's not afraid
[50:56] and so because he knows the future and
[50:58] so we're just thankful for that today
[51:02] amen
[51:03] and any good to us
[51:05] my dad's youngest sister her name is
[51:09] Linda is being baptized today and I'm
[51:13] kind of emotional about that and she's
[51:17] she's come back my brother's church is
[51:19] is doing well and and I've just been
[51:22] praying for a blessing and and he's he
[51:25] wanted me to pray for him this morning
[51:27] that God would just be with him and and
[51:31] new faces are showing up there and so
[51:33] we're praying that God would just come
[51:35] on the scene for Amen in a special way
[51:38] and
[51:38] and I know if my dad could look over the
[51:41] stage over the balcony today he'd be a
[51:44] very happy man
[51:46] be a very happy man and
[51:48] his youngest sister Linda and she was
[51:51] always close to us as children and amen
[51:54] want to remember brother Roger's family
[51:57] uh brother Roger lost his brother this
[51:59] week Eddie and uh
[52:02] I want to remember brother Roger's
[52:04] family got a very nice card from Sister
[52:06] Gooden and just thanking everyone for
[52:10] sister pearls
[52:12] passed on Beyond this realm of tears and
[52:15] pray that God would just be with that
[52:17] family and touch them I want to remember
[52:19] brother Jewel I spoke to him yesterday
[52:22] when I got off the phone I just got had
[52:25] a big long cry and so Brother Jules in a
[52:28] very tough spot I want to remember I
[52:31] want to remember him and his family as
[52:33] they're going through that in a special
[52:35] way brother Philip roncali that is going
[52:37] to have open heart surgery on Tuesday
[52:39] and brother Philip is an incredible guy
[52:42] and uh
[52:44] he's a great singer he's probably one of
[52:47] my favorites and
[52:48] if he only knew how great he was his
[52:50] head would be that big but I'm thankful
[52:52] that God don't necessarily let a man
[52:54] know how great he is and so we just love
[52:57] him with all of our hearts if you would
[52:58] remember him in a special way sister Sue
[53:01] is going to UVA this week and they're
[53:04] going to look to see if if the nerve
[53:06] damage that she has is permanent so we
[53:09] want to pray for these things that God
[53:11] would just come on the scene in a
[53:13] special way let's stand to our feet
[53:16] today
[53:17] amen any good to us
[53:25] I want to speak to you today and this is
[53:27] just very dear to my heart
[53:31] on the moment of the miraculous
[53:35] and I have to be very honest with you I
[53:37] believe that we're going to see
[53:39] phenomenal miracles
[53:42] in this service
[53:45] so I want you to look at this in the
[53:47] next little bit as a
[53:49] as a moment
[53:51] and every service is important but
[53:53] there's certain times that a certain
[53:56] gear just kind of slips into place and
[53:59] so I'm looking for it for myself
[54:02] that God would just come and help us
[54:05] brother Donnie Reagan spoke some words
[54:07] about sugar diabetes and a brother was
[54:10] sitting in the audience and he said when
[54:13] brother Donnie said it he felt a warm
[54:15] sensation go over top of him and he was
[54:17] completely healed
[54:20] it was just completely healed and I I
[54:23] spoke to brother Andrew yesterday and
[54:25] just shared some words and
[54:27] and uh I I'll just be honest with you
[54:30] cancer cancer weakens you in today's
[54:33] been I'll be honest with you this
[54:36] morning if I could have called in sick
[54:37] today would have been the day but
[54:39] actually even brother Donnie called me
[54:41] this morning and prayed for me over the
[54:43] phone before I before I came to the
[54:45] pulpit
[54:48] but
[54:49] if
[54:51] I I just told Andrew I said if I could
[54:54] get rid of the sugar diabetes
[54:56] first of all the medicines cost about
[54:58] fifteen hundred dollars a month and I
[55:01] really like to not have to spend that
[55:03] but the ups and the Downs of it it's a
[55:07] it's an uncontrollable thing for me
[55:09] because my pancreas doesn't work at all
[55:12] and so chemo destroyed the pancreas and
[55:16] so I'm praying even as I preached today
[55:18] that I would receive a miracle
[55:21] amen you'll turn with me to Psalms
[55:24] chapter 118 Verse 23.
[55:33] Psalms 118 Verse 23.
[55:37] amen I thought the songs were just
[55:40] perfect today
[55:41] amen glad to have brother Marcus his
[55:43] wife with us today amen
[55:47] and we've adopted brother Marcus so you
[55:50] take care of him
[55:55] Psalms 118 Verse 23.
[55:59] this is the Lord's doing and it is
[56:01] marvelous in our eyes
[56:05] no decision next words
[56:07] this is the day which the Lord hath made
[56:11] we will rejoice and be glad in it you
[56:15] can be seated
[56:19] I'd just like to read some scriptures
[56:21] before I make my opening statements
[56:24] First Corinthians chapter 15 and verse
[56:27] 51.
[56:29] behold I show you a mystery
[56:32] we shall not all sleep
[56:35] but we shall
[56:37] we shall all be changed
[56:41] we happen to believe we're living in the
[56:43] day where we're going to see this take
[56:45] place
[56:46] in a moment and a twinkling of an eye at
[56:50] the last Trump for the trumpet shall
[56:53] sound and the dead shall be raised
[56:55] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[57:00] for this corruptable must put on
[57:02] incorruption and this Mortal put on
[57:06] immortality
[57:08] first Thessalonians chapter 4 and verse
[57:11] 13.
[57:15] but I would not have you to be ignorant
[57:18] Brethren concerning them which are
[57:20] asleep
[57:21] that you sorrow not even as others which
[57:24] have no hope
[57:26] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[57:28] rose again even so also
[57:32] them also which sleep in Jesus will God
[57:37] bring with him
[57:38] for this we say unto you by the word of
[57:41] the Lord that that we which are alive
[57:44] and remain
[57:46] unto the coming of the Lord shall not
[57:49] prevent them which are asleep
[57:51] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[57:54] heaven
[57:55] with a shout we understand this is going
[57:58] on with the voice of the Archangel with
[58:01] the Trump of God
[58:04] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[58:07] then we which are alive and remain shall
[58:11] be caught up together within the clouds
[58:13] to meet the Lord in the air and so shall
[58:18] we ever be with the Lord wherefore
[58:21] Comfort one another with these words
[58:25] Revelations chapter 3 and verse 20.
[58:28] behold I stand at the door and knock and
[58:30] if any man hear my voice
[58:32] and open the door I will come into him
[58:35] and will sup with him and he with me
[58:38] to him that overcometh
[58:41] somebody's going to overcome
[58:44] I believe I believe we're one of those
[58:47] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[58:49] set with me in my throne even as I also
[58:54] overcame and then sat down with my
[58:56] father
[58:57] in his throne
[59:00] Revelation chapter 19 and verse 6.
[59:04] and I beheld as if it were the voice of
[59:06] a great multitude as a voice of many
[59:09] Waters have a voice of Mighty thundering
[59:12] saying hallelujah for the Lord God
[59:15] omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and
[59:18] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[59:21] marriage of the Lamb has come
[59:24] and we're living in this this day and
[59:27] his wife has made herself ready
[59:33] catch that moment
[59:35] Revelations 21 and verse 2.
[59:39] and I John saw the holy city the New
[59:41] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[59:44] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[59:47] her husband and I heard a great voice
[59:49] out of Heaven saying behold the
[59:52] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[59:55] will dwell with them and they shall be
[59:57] his people and God himself shall be with
[59:59] him and be their God and God shall wipe
[1:00:02] away all tears from their eyes
[1:00:05] and there shall be no more death neither
[1:00:08] sorrow nor crying neither shall there be
[1:00:10] any more pain for the former things are
[1:00:13] passed away and he that set upon the
[1:00:16] throne said behold I make all things new
[1:00:21] and he said unto me right for these
[1:00:24] words are true and faithful and he said
[1:00:27] unto me it is done and I am Alpha and
[1:00:30] Omega the beginning of the end and I
[1:00:32] will give unto thee that is The Thirst
[1:00:33] the Fountain of Water of Life freely
[1:00:37] and he that overcometh shall inherit all
[1:00:40] things
[1:00:41] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[1:00:45] son
[1:00:47] amen
[1:00:49] amen
[1:00:50] Luke chapter 1 and verse 30.
[1:00:55] and the angel said unto her
[1:00:58] fear not Mary
[1:01:00] you talking about a moment
[1:01:04] fear not Mary
[1:01:06] for thou has found favor with God
[1:01:10] and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[1:01:14] womb and bring forth a son and shall
[1:01:17] call his name Jesus
[1:01:21] verse 37. for with God nothing
[1:01:27] I want you to read this with me for with
[1:01:30] God nothing shall be impossible come to
[1:01:35] read the next verse and Mary said behold
[1:01:39] the handmaid of the Lord
[1:01:41] be it unto me according to Thy Word
[1:01:45] and the angel departed from her
[1:01:52] thank you
[1:01:58] sometimes we don't realize it but we're
[1:02:01] in the moment of a miracle
[1:02:04] amen
[1:02:06] It's just sometimes it just happens so
[1:02:09] simply
[1:02:09] until there we are we're actually the
[1:02:13] moment becomes greater than
[1:02:15] than we can even imagine
[1:02:18] it happens because it's Sovereign God
[1:02:21] does it
[1:02:22] no man can produce that
[1:02:25] only a man has to just realize that
[1:02:28] there's a certain time and there's a
[1:02:30] certain place
[1:02:32] it's an orchestrated Moment by almighty
[1:02:35] God
[1:02:36] and we realize it's a wind of a vision
[1:02:40] and it's just literally it just takes
[1:02:42] place and then we're there
[1:02:44] brother Branham said that Moses stepped
[1:02:46] and he looked out the window
[1:02:48] he had become
[1:02:50] a man that's now being groomed to be
[1:02:53] pharaoh
[1:02:55] and he had all of that behind him but he
[1:02:58] came to that moment
[1:03:01] that moment would change his life
[1:03:03] forever
[1:03:04] he would see those slaves now as
[1:03:07] not slaves
[1:03:09] but he would see them as the children of
[1:03:11] God
[1:03:13] Ramses would walk to that same window
[1:03:16] and see incredible opportunities
[1:03:18] incredible future with with those people
[1:03:21] and he would see them as slaves he would
[1:03:25] not see them as God's children
[1:03:28] Moses knew about had had the same focus
[1:03:31] and I thought last night was so perfect
[1:03:34] these two Services lined so perfectly up
[1:03:37] together but
[1:03:39] both of them would have a vision or a
[1:03:42] focus
[1:03:44] and it would be alike for all of those
[1:03:46] years
[1:03:48] but in that Sovereign moment Moses would
[1:03:51] look out and see something much
[1:03:53] different
[1:03:55] and then he would come to a place that
[1:03:59] he'd been in that Hill Country for all
[1:04:01] of that time
[1:04:03] but he would see a bush that was burning
[1:04:05] and was not consumed
[1:04:08] it would be a moment that would change
[1:04:10] history
[1:04:12] and he would become a one-man invasion
[1:04:16] he would become a one-man Invasion to
[1:04:19] the greatest the greatest country with
[1:04:22] the greatest army with the greatest
[1:04:24] architect
[1:04:27] and he knew all of that
[1:04:29] but after he met God it wasn't
[1:04:31] intimidating anymore
[1:04:34] because God was greater
[1:04:37] than all of that infrastructure all of
[1:04:41] that Army all of that government because
[1:04:44] he met somebody that was greater than
[1:04:47] all of that
[1:04:50] and we realize that these moments are
[1:04:52] orchestrated of God
[1:04:54] we follow a prophet that was a boy that
[1:04:58] was a if we could say it he was a
[1:05:00] bootlegger son
[1:05:02] as a matter of fact being a bootlegger
[1:05:05] son his daddy had been in trouble
[1:05:08] even his daddy you talk about
[1:05:10] orchestration his daddy would change his
[1:05:13] name
[1:05:15] and in changing his name
[1:05:18] he would add letters to where that it
[1:05:20] would be seven letters
[1:05:26] God's not so concerned about your
[1:05:29] trouble
[1:05:32] he knows he's got a plan
[1:05:35] he's not concerned about your history of
[1:05:39] being a bootlegger son
[1:05:41] so many times we got chapters in our
[1:05:44] book that we're so ashamed of
[1:05:46] God doesn't even pay any attention to
[1:05:48] the stuff
[1:05:51] as a matter of fact he doesn't pay any
[1:05:53] attention to your personal feelings and
[1:05:56] your personal thoughts
[1:05:57] he's got a plan
[1:05:59] [Music]
[1:06:01] he's got a plan and let me just say
[1:06:03] you're
[1:06:05] too
[1:06:07] spoonfuls of brains
[1:06:10] who can figure out the mind of God
[1:06:14] oh brother Ron but I'd like to argue
[1:06:16] with brother Branham try that out really
[1:06:18] for science think about what you're
[1:06:20] doing
[1:06:22] oh but I'd like to argue with you're
[1:06:25] arguing with God
[1:06:28] now let me just remind you
[1:06:31] God from his form said let there be
[1:06:36] you're talking about a moment
[1:06:39] and he said let there be and brother
[1:06:41] Graham said
[1:06:42] he believed his own word
[1:06:45] and it began to come into existence
[1:06:49] that's kind of mind you're arguing with
[1:06:52] and he wrote the first Bible in the
[1:06:54] heavens
[1:06:55] every one of them in order
[1:07:00] now as I think along these things maybe
[1:07:03] you saw me writing in my book last night
[1:07:09] here's my notes for today
[1:07:13] and I got it right there
[1:07:17] we got to be sensitive to the moment
[1:07:21] I heard the voice say get quiet in a
[1:07:25] service
[1:07:26] get quiet
[1:07:27] and I just sit very quietly
[1:07:30] I just told brother wiggin I was
[1:07:32] studying on a certain thought
[1:07:34] and all of a sudden I hear that voice
[1:07:36] say get quiet
[1:07:37] and then he began to come like a like a
[1:07:40] flow
[1:07:44] you know I think about
[1:07:47] and the anniversary of being burned
[1:07:50] it left my lungs extremely scarred
[1:07:55] to which that I couldn't I couldn't
[1:07:57] hardly walk up long flights of steps
[1:08:00] without stopping and pausing
[1:08:03] I preached by the mystical's median and
[1:08:05] I fought to be able to do that it would
[1:08:08] drain my energies
[1:08:10] we left brother biscals and came to the
[1:08:12] North Carolina camp
[1:08:14] brother mystical is standing he's the
[1:08:17] speaker there at North Carolina brother
[1:08:18] Joe Greene's now
[1:08:20] and so he's standing and he's speaking a
[1:08:23] sermon called
[1:08:24] bringing order out of Chaos
[1:08:28] how the world was without form and void
[1:08:31] and how that it was in such a place and
[1:08:34] then he would begin to describe how that
[1:08:37] God begins to mold the Earth
[1:08:40] and he brings order and I was sitting in
[1:08:42] the balcony beside a brother Homer and
[1:08:45] sister Nancy with Connie and I was
[1:08:47] sitting there and about about three
[1:08:50] quarters away through the sermon I
[1:08:52] realized this is my moment
[1:08:56] and I just stood to my feet and lifted
[1:08:58] my hands and literally it felt like a
[1:09:01] power of air began to be compressed down
[1:09:04] into my lungs
[1:09:06] and I was energized
[1:09:09] I don't know how many people were there
[1:09:11] maybe 1200 people was there but it was
[1:09:13] my moment
[1:09:16] are you with me it may be two or three
[1:09:18] hundred here this morning but it's your
[1:09:20] moment
[1:09:22] and as I was sitting there I just began
[1:09:25] to realize that the god that raised me
[1:09:27] up was now here to heal my lungs I want
[1:09:30] to tell you I had infection after
[1:09:32] infection for that year
[1:09:35] but after that night
[1:09:40] after that night God so healed me till I
[1:09:44] didn't have another lung infection
[1:09:54] you're talking about a moment even today
[1:09:57] with cancer in my lungs the doctor said
[1:10:00] if your lungs wasn't so healthy
[1:10:07] the doctors testify of that day
[1:10:11] of that moment of that miracle
[1:10:20] brother Branham was being
[1:10:22] was being chauffeured
[1:10:25] in South Africa
[1:10:28] and the chauffeur was taking him to the
[1:10:30] meetings
[1:10:32] and as he was taking him and he'd been
[1:10:34] so faithful now they're getting toward
[1:10:36] the end of the meeting and
[1:10:38] he said sir is there anything I can do
[1:10:40] for you
[1:10:42] he said well I have a friend
[1:10:45] that hasn't been able to get a prayer
[1:10:46] card for his little boy
[1:10:48] he suffers from paralysis in his legs
[1:10:52] and he can't get out of bed
[1:10:54] and he said he's just a couple of blocks
[1:10:57] away and he said well take me there but
[1:10:58] they're on the way to service
[1:11:00] brother Brown really wasn't too
[1:11:02] concerned about being on time
[1:11:06] and so they go and they walk up some
[1:11:09] steps and brother Branham walks into the
[1:11:12] apartment where the man is at with that
[1:11:14] little boy
[1:11:15] and he walks in and
[1:11:16] she walks in he greets the people that
[1:11:19] was there
[1:11:20] walks over to the bed and greets the
[1:11:22] little boy
[1:11:24] brother Branham didn't pray
[1:11:27] he'd been agonize before God he he
[1:11:30] reaches on the floor and he says is this
[1:11:32] your ball
[1:11:34] is this your ball
[1:11:36] yeah yes it is and he thought it out the
[1:11:39] window
[1:11:40] and he said go get it
[1:11:44] and the little boy jumped off of the bed
[1:11:46] and went and got it
[1:11:49] [Applause]
[1:11:58] I've been in some special moments in my
[1:12:01] life
[1:12:04] to where that we've seen some phenomenal
[1:12:06] things
[1:12:07] whether it's a little girl coming out of
[1:12:09] a wheelchair
[1:12:11] brother there was they came and got me
[1:12:14] out of the car
[1:12:16] said it's a little girl in a wheelchair
[1:12:19] I was war wore out and
[1:12:22] I remember I remember getting out of the
[1:12:24] going back into the tent meeting
[1:12:34] they took that little girl
[1:12:36] by her feet
[1:12:39] and I began to pray
[1:12:43] and after a bit
[1:12:45] I felt her little feet come loose
[1:12:52] and she said I believe I can walk
[1:12:55] she ran all over the place
[1:12:58] [Applause]
[1:13:06] I think what a difference that a moment
[1:13:08] makes
[1:13:10] I think of the morning that I was in my
[1:13:13] office
[1:13:15] and I was I was there and the Lord spoke
[1:13:17] to me
[1:13:25] to pick up brother Williams boy
[1:13:28] and carry him and pray for him
[1:13:34] and I actually told the Lord he won't
[1:13:35] let me pick him up
[1:13:39] and he instructed me to do exactly what
[1:13:41] he told me and I stood in this pulpit
[1:13:44] and I walked and I walked to that place
[1:13:46] three different times and he kept
[1:13:48] nudging me he kept nudging me
[1:13:50] and when they nudged me that final time
[1:13:52] I stepped off of the stage and I picked
[1:13:54] him up
[1:13:56] you're talking about a generational
[1:13:58] miracle
[1:14:01] if it doesn't happen that boy is a that
[1:14:03] boy's a a boy that's a
[1:14:06] in a situation to where he he's not
[1:14:10] going to be able to walk
[1:14:12] listen it's one thing when they're a
[1:14:14] small child but when they become a
[1:14:16] teenager
[1:14:18] when they become 20 and 30 years old and
[1:14:21] they're in a wheelchair
[1:14:24] your life would have been much different
[1:14:27] but because Jesus came
[1:14:39] I thought about I thought about this
[1:14:42] morning of a little lady that says on
[1:14:44] Tuesday they're going to take the baby
[1:14:46] because it's it's dead
[1:14:49] and I just I just looked down at her and
[1:14:52] and I said
[1:14:54] let's just Speak Life
[1:14:57] and we spoke life
[1:14:59] she didn't have a dead baby when they
[1:15:01] went in to get the baby that baby was
[1:15:04] alive
[1:15:05] you're talking about a God that can that
[1:15:08] can speak life
[1:15:16] other man would say when all the saints
[1:15:18] sitting at that table
[1:15:21] the wedding supper
[1:15:23] we'll look across the table to one
[1:15:25] another
[1:15:26] won't that be a wonderful time
[1:15:30] listen these Services these moments that
[1:15:33] we're in is more important than
[1:15:35] everything we do in the week
[1:15:38] what a wonderful time won't that be a
[1:15:41] wonderful time
[1:15:43] oh my brother Ron I'm so consumed with
[1:15:45] this and I'm is it worth it
[1:15:50] I want to think about what the enemy's
[1:15:53] offering you
[1:15:55] to not be there
[1:15:58] because he knows this is the only space
[1:16:00] that he can tempt you but listen in this
[1:16:03] moment overcome
[1:16:06] so you can sit at that table
[1:16:10] won't that be a wonderful time I would
[1:16:13] assure you one thing there won't be one
[1:16:16] sick person
[1:16:19] boom
[1:16:25] we'll just simply sit down
[1:16:31] they want to make that appointment
[1:16:35] brother Brandon says I want to make that
[1:16:37] appointment
[1:16:41] he's starting a service and he says
[1:16:44] Jesus is here tonight
[1:16:47] because Jesus keeps his appointments
[1:16:51] no matter how you were you
[1:16:54] he kept his appointments with Jonah in a
[1:16:58] belly of a well
[1:17:00] he kept his appointment with Daniel in
[1:17:02] the Lion's Den
[1:17:03] he kept his appointment with the
[1:17:06] children the three Hebrew children in a
[1:17:08] fiery furnace
[1:17:11] he kept his appointment with me on a
[1:17:15] death bed
[1:17:18] what a statement
[1:17:20] I truly believe before the church can
[1:17:23] have a rapture
[1:17:25] it's got to have rapturing faith
[1:17:28] we can't even have faith for Divine
[1:17:30] Healing let alone rapturing faith got to
[1:17:33] have a faith that'll change and Quicken
[1:17:36] this body
[1:17:38] and be taken away I believe the church
[1:17:41] is on its Road the power of the Living
[1:17:43] God that men and women will speak the
[1:17:46] word here and there it'll flash like
[1:17:50] lightning and a church is coming not
[1:17:55] some psychologist not some put on not
[1:18:00] make belief but real true genuine
[1:18:03] anointed Holy Ghost
[1:18:06] called out Church
[1:18:09] I think what a powerful statement right
[1:18:12] in that
[1:18:18] I think what a difference one Glimpse
[1:18:20] makes
[1:18:22] just a glimpse
[1:18:25] just a glimpse you just catch a glimpse
[1:18:28] and you get so much information
[1:18:31] in just a glimpse
[1:18:34] if our nation
[1:18:37] as a whole could get a glimpse of hell
[1:18:46] we live in a nation where a hundred
[1:18:48] churches shut down a month
[1:18:51] if they could get a glimpse of hell
[1:18:55] the Weeping The Wailing the gnashing of
[1:18:58] teeth the nakedness no friends
[1:19:02] no returning back to normal
[1:19:06] it's not a place I want to go to
[1:19:10] but if we could get a glimpse of Heaven
[1:19:14] we can get a good UPS of Heaven
[1:19:22] I want you to remember for the believer
[1:19:26] this is as close to hell as you'll ever
[1:19:28] get
[1:19:30] but for the unbeliever
[1:19:33] this is as close to heaven
[1:19:42] I found this quote the other day and I
[1:19:45] thought it was so
[1:19:49] brother Graham says
[1:19:51] so if you die
[1:19:54] or if you live
[1:19:56] what difference does it make
[1:20:03] if he comes today
[1:20:06] or if it comes in a hundred years
[1:20:09] or a thousand years
[1:20:12] I'll only rest
[1:20:14] I'll only rest till my change comes
[1:20:23] I thought what a powerful
[1:20:26] statement
[1:20:28] I believe he must have been standing in
[1:20:31] Two Worlds at the same time
[1:20:36] he says how do you feel brother Branham
[1:20:38] when you're standing there and you and
[1:20:40] your people coming in different
[1:20:42] languages and things are you afraid
[1:20:46] no sir
[1:20:48] no sir
[1:20:50] he said so
[1:20:53] never be afraid
[1:20:55] because if if he told me
[1:20:58] so
[1:20:59] and I believe it's the truth
[1:21:02] I don't want you to notice what he says
[1:21:05] if he told me tonight
[1:21:07] to go to the presidential graveyard and
[1:21:11] raise up George Washington
[1:21:14] tomorrow morning
[1:21:16] I would invite the whole world
[1:21:22] come and see it done
[1:21:26] and I'd say bring every critic
[1:21:30] that you can stand
[1:21:33] them around
[1:21:35] to believe the same people are watching
[1:21:37] I want you to go to this quote
[1:21:41] bring every critic
[1:21:45] and stand them around it you're going to
[1:21:47] see the glory of God
[1:21:50] that's how much he knew where he was
[1:21:53] standing
[1:21:56] get that chair over here where you can
[1:21:59] sit down and rest a little while
[1:22:01] he'll be here in just a moment
[1:22:06] say brother Ron what basis did he have
[1:22:09] he was just throwing out a a statement
[1:22:12] about George Washington
[1:22:15] no I believe George Washington was a
[1:22:17] Christian
[1:22:19] and I believe on Resurrection morning
[1:22:21] he'll rise
[1:22:26] [Applause]
[1:22:36] he says I love him and I want you to
[1:22:38] love him
[1:22:40] I want you to believe him
[1:22:42] perfect love cast out all fear
[1:22:45] and if you love him with the right kind
[1:22:47] of heart
[1:22:49] you won't have one Speck of fear
[1:22:51] whether you can keep his word or not
[1:22:55] night after night standing on the
[1:22:57] platform before it gross thousands of
[1:22:59] people around the world critics sitting
[1:23:02] there and say it's this or that or the
[1:23:05] other Witch Doctor standing there trying
[1:23:08] to throw his spells on you challenge you
[1:23:10] to duels and things like that never one
[1:23:14] time I say by the grace of God
[1:23:17] has one Speck of fear ever hit my heart
[1:23:21] not one time why he said he would take
[1:23:25] care of me
[1:23:28] and I believe him that's right
[1:23:31] if I get scared I'd run
[1:23:35] but I tell you when Jesus Christ anoints
[1:23:38] you you're not made out of running
[1:23:41] material
[1:23:44] the Rock of Gibraltar
[1:23:47] he said not the Rock of Gibraltar but
[1:23:49] the Rock of Ages you climb up into the
[1:23:52] Rock of Ages that's God's word and take
[1:23:55] your position there and stand while the
[1:23:58] gates of hell is battling against it
[1:24:01] with a perfect assurance that he who
[1:24:04] promised it not fail will never fail
[1:24:09] that's right that's when you're not
[1:24:12] scared the devil's nothing but a bluff
[1:24:15] anyhow snorting and blowing all Thunder
[1:24:19] and no lightning but I tell you the
[1:24:21] lightning power of the resurrected Jesus
[1:24:24] Christ puts a reality there that shocks
[1:24:28] the soul from a debt Slumber of these
[1:24:31] Earthly bound things into Immortal
[1:24:33] realms
[1:24:35] to believe God and take him at his word
[1:24:38] and call these things which are not as
[1:24:41] though they were
[1:24:51] I want to read that again
[1:24:53] Jesus Christ put such a reality
[1:24:56] there that shocks the soul from a dead
[1:24:59] slumber to these Earthly bound things
[1:25:03] into Immortal Realms you're talking
[1:25:05] about a mortal a moment
[1:25:09] to believe God and take him at his word
[1:25:12] and call those things which are not
[1:25:15] as though
[1:25:17] they were
[1:25:26] we go to doctors
[1:25:32] sister Connie has been so faithful
[1:25:36] Connie did not know what I was going to
[1:25:39] preach today
[1:25:42] but here's my wife and you know you look
[1:25:44] at her and she's a queen she's a lady
[1:25:48] she's an incredible person
[1:25:51] but she married a guy that would fall 40
[1:25:54] feet
[1:25:58] and they would tell us that I wouldn't
[1:26:00] walk again
[1:26:02] and my dad would stand beside my bed and
[1:26:05] I'll never forget his prayer
[1:26:09] I am a son of God
[1:26:12] reminding God of who he was
[1:26:16] and this is a Son of God and he's got a
[1:26:19] purpose
[1:26:22] and in his purpose
[1:26:25] God you can raise him up tonight
[1:26:28] and you spoke to me coming down the road
[1:26:32] that tonight he'll walk out of this
[1:26:35] Hospital
[1:26:39] you spoke to me tonight that he'll walk
[1:26:42] out of this Hospital
[1:26:45] it was snowing
[1:26:47] it was icing
[1:26:49] and God spoke to him in the car
[1:26:53] brother on I don't believe it I don't
[1:26:55] care
[1:26:58] I'm standing on two feet
[1:27:01] [Applause]
[1:27:09] you see sometimes our words are not the
[1:27:12] words of a man
[1:27:15] literally we cross into another realm
[1:27:18] when the anointing comes and our words
[1:27:20] are not the words of a man I believe my
[1:27:23] father as a minister of the Gospel
[1:27:26] believing brother Branham was message
[1:27:28] since 61.
[1:27:31] I believe that believing this third pull
[1:27:36] and he stood and said I am a son of God
[1:27:42] listen when that doctor spoke to me and
[1:27:44] said
[1:27:45] You'll Never Walk again my response was
[1:27:48] immediate you don't know who you're
[1:27:50] talking to
[1:27:54] are you with me
[1:27:56] when I was burned when I was burned
[1:27:59] there brother Tim Pruitt came and spoke
[1:28:01] two sermons on on the Hall of of Fame
[1:28:05] and the other one was was on on on God
[1:28:10] will have a testimony
[1:28:12] sister Connie made notes
[1:28:15] I want you to think about what a what a
[1:28:18] powerful person she is
[1:28:20] and she might hurt me later but
[1:28:25] I was non-responsive
[1:28:29] in Uva
[1:28:32] I don't criticize anybody for being in
[1:28:35] the hospital or staying with their loved
[1:28:36] ones but this is what she believed God
[1:28:40] first
[1:28:42] I had I have taught all of you never let
[1:28:45] a negative word or thought go through
[1:28:48] your mind
[1:28:51] and she took my preaching through all of
[1:28:53] those years and she got in the car and
[1:28:56] she drove to these services and not just
[1:28:58] drove to these Services there was no
[1:29:01] poor pitiful me
[1:29:03] she took the words of Tim Pruitt as the
[1:29:06] words of God and she wrote them down I
[1:29:09] have them I didn't I'm not going to go
[1:29:11] to them today but she wrote them down
[1:29:16] there's no accidents with God
[1:29:19] has a purpose in all of that
[1:29:23] and we celebrate the anniversary
[1:29:28] the devil thought he would destroy us
[1:29:33] but the scripture says no weapon
[1:29:39] and sometimes you come in the moments
[1:29:42] and maybe it listen that scripture may
[1:29:45] not affect you for a long time and all
[1:29:48] of a sudden you come into a trial and
[1:29:50] you take that scripture and say Deva no
[1:29:54] weapon that is formed against me shall
[1:29:57] prosper
[1:30:06] I don't know so much about a Hall of
[1:30:08] Fame but I do believe I'm one of God's
[1:30:10] generals
[1:30:13] so I conduct myself so
[1:30:16] [Applause]
[1:30:28] but his second sermon is God will have a
[1:30:32] testimony
[1:30:33] and I believe that was a prophecy
[1:30:39] sometimes I don't think we realize where
[1:30:42] we're sitting or where we're standing
[1:30:45] can I just mention a couple of things
[1:30:46] here
[1:30:47] I've been in a couple special moments
[1:30:52] Andrew will you come
[1:30:53] maybe William if you'll stand beside me
[1:30:57] here
[1:30:58] both of your businessmen both of your
[1:31:01] businessmen I'm going to tell a couple
[1:31:03] testimonies I'm sorry to keep you
[1:31:05] standing for a moment but I think you'll
[1:31:07] like it
[1:31:10] why am I doing this because he
[1:31:12] instructed me to do this
[1:31:14] I just follow my ball I got a good boss
[1:31:18] I got a really good boss
[1:31:23] I'm kind of in a moment like when I told
[1:31:25] you at Ciro's Mary
[1:31:28] I see Zach
[1:31:32] but it didn't tell you it would be a
[1:31:34] church
[1:31:36] when I see Zach and you were standing
[1:31:40] you remember that moment you cried
[1:31:44] and now it's history
[1:31:45] but that was a moment for you
[1:31:48] and the rain just literally was blowed
[1:31:51] your plans up for a wedding but you were
[1:31:53] supposed to be here and you remember I
[1:31:56] held that thought from that Vision it'll
[1:31:58] happen at church
[1:32:01] and I didn't remind you of it
[1:32:04] but it will happen at church and I saved
[1:32:07] it for the moment and and people were
[1:32:09] sitting all over and I said God I know
[1:32:12] this is orchestrated with God because in
[1:32:15] the vision I saw Zach and I saw Mary and
[1:32:18] I saw it at church not at the river
[1:32:24] that was a moment
[1:32:31] so I'm I'm standing

[1:33:18] he's at a spot
[1:33:21] and I'm praying for him about his back
[1:33:24] and then I start to pray for him about
[1:33:27] his business
[1:33:29] and I just simply asked him
[1:33:32] I've never ever did this before and I
[1:33:35] said what's your hobby
[1:33:38] and he says
[1:33:39] I've got a greenhouse
[1:33:41] while the greenhouse is a small
[1:33:42] Greenhouse
[1:33:44] it's a small place it's just
[1:33:47] you remember how big it was six 10 by
[1:33:51] 20.

[1:34:05] ready to be blessed exponentially too
[1:34:10] and so
[1:34:11] I'm standing there with Aiden
[1:34:14] and I asked him I said what's your
[1:34:17] what's your hobby and he says have a
[1:34:19] little Greenhouse
[1:34:21] and we pray for it to be blessed
[1:34:28] I can't do that
[1:34:31] God heals his back
[1:34:35] and then I think he's got five acres
[1:34:40] five acres
[1:34:43] yeah
[1:34:46] [Applause]
[1:34:59] I'm setting I'm not done I'm setting
[1:35:02] at a table a couple of years ago at
[1:35:05] brother Wayne Lawson's house
[1:35:07] and Ben
[1:35:09] is going to
[1:35:12] going to leave the nursing and just do
[1:35:14] it part-time but he's going to go to
[1:35:16] that Greenhouse
[1:35:18] and they're going to do pumpkins
[1:35:21] you know this is a step of faith
[1:35:25] and as I'm there I felt the Holy Spirit
[1:35:27] to pronounce a blessing
[1:35:29] and he's sitting on the other end of a
[1:35:31] long table Brother Ray Erickson sitting
[1:35:34] here by the Wayne is sitting here
[1:35:35] there's others that are there I think
[1:35:36] David keckley was there
[1:35:39] and I just I just begin to speak and as
[1:35:42] I began to speak to brother Ben
[1:35:45] the spirit of God drops
[1:35:48] 40 people in the room the spirit of God
[1:35:51] drops and brother
[1:35:52] Ray Erickson begins to speak in tongues
[1:35:55] we're not ashamed of that
[1:35:58] that's God's language
[1:36:00] the spirit of God begins to drop and the
[1:36:03] Holy Ghost begins to go and and listen
[1:36:05] there have been a lot of noise with the
[1:36:07] talk and the chatter and children
[1:36:09] playing but immediately it becomes hush
[1:36:13] and the presence of God is just echoing
[1:36:15] through the place and it was a moment
[1:36:19] listen
[1:36:20] just yesterday brother Ben Erickson sent
[1:36:23] me pictures three
[1:36:26] of this is the greatest Harvest that's
[1:36:30] ever that's a he's ever had
[1:36:33] it's a Monumental year
[1:36:38] no man can do that
[1:36:44] I'm in China and I'm in a in a room
[1:36:48] in a Chinese room
[1:36:50] in that hotel
[1:36:52] and all the brothers are there with us
[1:36:55] brother Glenn gruner
[1:36:58] his business was in the failed mode
[1:37:02] and it was it was not doing well and
[1:37:04] nothing he could do to spark it and as I
[1:37:07] am as I am as I'm there I'm sitting in
[1:37:10] the window well
[1:37:12] the window well I'm sitting literally in
[1:37:15] the corner in the window well I'm tired
[1:37:17] I'm exhausted
[1:37:19] and I feel the presence of the Lord
[1:37:23] and as I did we prayed for brother
[1:37:25] Glenn's business
[1:37:27] and as we prayed for brother Glenn's
[1:37:29] business
[1:37:31] brother brother Glenn from that moment
[1:37:37] cannot keep up with the orders
[1:37:40] no man can do that
[1:37:52] I have these two men for a purpose I
[1:37:55] believe God's getting ready to bless
[1:37:57] your businesses
[1:38:11] I can't explain it
[1:38:14] but just as much as a little boy begin
[1:38:16] to walk
[1:38:22] God
[1:38:23] owns it all
[1:38:27] he owns the cattle in a thousand hills
[1:38:31] he's not governed by the economy of
[1:38:34] America or the economy of the world
[1:38:42] he owns it all
[1:38:46] he owns it all
[1:38:56] I don't know how I don't know when but I
[1:39:00] want to tell you God is going to bless
[1:39:03] you
[1:39:04] [Music]
[1:39:05] so much until people will be jealous of
[1:39:08] you but let them be jealous
[1:39:12] let the Heathen rage you are with
[1:39:15] partners of almighty God
[1:39:19] I speak it in the name of the Lord
[1:39:31] receive it in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:39:34] giving Glory giving praise
[1:39:52] brother Ron but that's that's your son
[1:39:54] that's that's brother William that's the
[1:39:56] ministry you want a business what you
[1:39:58] stand to your feet right now
[1:39:59] while the while the rain has fallen once
[1:40:02] you just receive it right now
[1:40:05] [Applause]
[1:40:25] you may be seated
[1:40:33] foreign
[1:40:40] people would walk into the prayer lines
[1:40:43] with brother Branham
[1:40:52] and they would feel that warm presence
[1:40:54] he said no that won't hurt you
[1:40:59] that won't hurt you that's him
[1:41:04] that won't hurt you
[1:41:08] in a moment
[1:41:11] they would go from a cancer patient
[1:41:15] to a well patient
[1:41:18] they'd go from a blind patient
[1:41:21] to a seeing patient
[1:41:29] we should think about that can you
[1:41:32] imagine how much Satan hates
[1:41:34] this message
[1:41:38] because it has the same creative power
[1:41:42] that God exhibited and let there be
[1:41:46] for Satan he knows us getting ready to
[1:41:49] come a resurrection
[1:41:51] and he can put an armed demon
[1:41:54] at every grave site
[1:42:01] oh I feel the presence of the Lord
[1:42:03] he can put an armed demon at every grave
[1:42:07] site and he can't stop
[1:42:13] from Dimensions blending
[1:42:19] Hallelujah
[1:42:35] Oh Brother on

[1:42:47] no way could she perform the word of the
[1:42:50] Lord even when she was 65.
[1:42:55] but God spoke to her there's nothing
[1:42:59] impossible
[1:43:01] [Applause]
[1:43:04] listen that word Had Creative Black
[1:43:08] Sails inside of it
[1:43:12] that word was the creativity of God you
[1:43:16] don't have to figure it out just take
[1:43:18] him at his word and believe his word and
[1:43:22] hang on to his word and let his words
[1:43:25] settlement
[1:43:26] [Applause]

[1:43:49] respond
[1:43:50] did God
[1:43:52] turn her Young
[1:43:58] we talk about a caribou we talk about a
[1:44:01] silver tip grizzly bear

[1:44:05] existence we talk about all of the third

[1:44:14] existence
[1:44:17] it still existence I'm no Prophet I'm

[1:44:25] I've just spent about 35 minutes telling
[1:44:28] you this message works
[1:44:30] I can't explain it I can't explain when
[1:44:33] it happens I just tell you we've got to
[1:44:36] stay in an atmosphere
[1:44:39] where this silver-haired man will turn
[1:44:41] redheaded again
[1:44:52] God's not so concerned about the stuff
[1:44:55] that I'm fighting right now
[1:44:57] he's going to change this body
[1:45:05] he's going to change this body and make
[1:45:07] it young again
[1:45:08] [Applause]
[1:45:22] sister Carla's our dear friend
[1:45:24] her family is very close to us we had
[1:45:27] children about the same ages and they're
[1:45:29] very close
[1:45:31] I knew Carla when you were held
[1:45:34] four five years old
[1:45:43] so she's been close to us she's the
[1:45:45] sister
[1:45:46] I'm not going to say it
[1:45:50] put her in our life and we love her with
[1:45:53] all of our hearts
[1:45:55] her daughter
[1:45:57] was playing the organ the other day at a
[1:46:00] meeting is this okay to tell
[1:46:03] playing an organ the other day
[1:46:06] and I was to preach tomorrow morning
[1:46:11] and I'm sitting in a line of preachers
[1:46:13] on the front row the meeting is going on
[1:46:16] brother Wayne Lawson's preaching
[1:46:21] and I'm sitting there
[1:46:23] and the Lord speaks to me and said
[1:46:26] you'll pray for her tonight
[1:46:29] now this is what you tell her
[1:46:36] he gave me Specific Instructions
[1:46:39] and I've learned just do what he said
[1:46:43] brother Wayne preaches
[1:46:45] and one I think a sister came up
[1:46:49] and they braid
[1:46:51] and then one after another people came
[1:46:54] up
[1:46:55] and I'm standing helping helping him
[1:46:58] pray with other brothers
[1:47:00] Andrew Glover brought his little boy up
[1:47:03] because these little boys like Drew or
[1:47:06] like Wesley
[1:47:09] and it hasn't attempted to walk yet but
[1:47:12] he will
[1:47:15] but he will
[1:47:17] but he will
[1:47:30] and I turned around and Amanda had left
[1:47:33] the organ and by the way she normally
[1:47:36] plays the piano
[1:47:38] and so God orchestrated it that she
[1:47:41] would play the P the organ that night
[1:47:44] sitting right in front of me
[1:47:47] and when he speaks to me she's directing
[1:47:49] Island
[1:47:52] and Amanda came and brother Wayne Lawson
[1:47:55] prayed for
[1:47:56] and I know my instructions
[1:48:00] and so I just I just stand and brother
[1:48:03] Wayne prays for her and he prays for her
[1:48:06] and
[1:48:06] you know she's she's moved
[1:48:09] she's moved
[1:48:11] and if you don't believe in emotions you
[1:48:13] just get a hold to God one time you'll
[1:48:15] get emotional
[1:48:18] and and uh you know I had a preacher one
[1:48:22] time tell me direct to me in my face
[1:48:23] said we've got to get the emotions out
[1:48:25] of it well he's a dry stick
[1:48:28] [Music]
[1:48:30] you know I don't know how to get the
[1:48:31] emotions out of God
[1:48:34] I married a wife and I like her emotions
[1:48:37] some of them they're not good but I
[1:48:39] still like them
[1:48:41] [Applause]
[1:48:42] I'm just being honest
[1:48:47] but I like 99.9 tenths of them
[1:48:53] and the other tense just to make me
[1:48:55] better
[1:48:59] and so I wait I wait until
[1:49:01] she kind of calms down and I've got her
[1:49:04] by the hand
[1:49:05] and I've got her by the hand and
[1:49:08] now it's my turn
[1:49:10] and I just begin to pray for her
[1:49:13] and then I told her exactly
[1:49:16] what the Lord told me to tell her
[1:49:22] Ken is okay to tell
[1:49:25] and I told her
[1:49:27] the reason that I fought for you
[1:49:31] the reason I fought for you is God
[1:49:34] showed me that you were his eternal seed
[1:49:41] you might be going through a hard time
[1:49:43] in your life
[1:49:45] but when it drops inside of you it's the
[1:49:49] Eternal part
[1:49:51] that makes the whole difference
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:59] she shouted all over that building
[1:50:06] that's emotion
[1:50:09] but I'll just tell you I like it
[1:50:13] [Applause]
[1:50:24] you know people want to criticize Andrew
[1:50:28] you know he's just too emotional
[1:50:31] you know you guys are just too wild
[1:50:36] so I'm going to give you about five
[1:50:38] minutes of a piece of my mind
[1:50:41] [Applause]
[1:51:06] I want to sing a verse for you
[1:51:08] without music and I'm not a good singer
[1:51:10] you don't know like I know
[1:51:13] what he's done for me
[1:51:16] you don't know like I know what he's
[1:51:19] done for me
[1:51:23] said you don't know like I know
[1:51:27] what he's done for me
[1:51:30] what the Lord
[1:51:34] has done for me
[1:51:40] I get happy when I think about what he's
[1:51:44] done for me
[1:51:45] I did happy when I think about what he's
[1:51:49] done for me
[1:51:51] I get happy when I think about what he's
[1:51:55] done for me what the Lord
[1:51:59] has done for me
[1:52:18] it's about to get good
[1:52:21] you can be seated
[1:52:24] you see the Lord that spoke to brother
[1:52:26] Ed biscoll that I would be the speaker
[1:52:28] next year at the camp meeting
[1:52:31] not just at the camp meeting
[1:52:34] but I would be the speaker at the camp
[1:52:35] meeting
[1:52:36] brother Ed invited my entire family
[1:52:40] to that meeting
[1:52:42] he wanted all of you guys to be there
[1:52:44] including my mother and father
[1:52:47] Andrew
[1:52:49] he didn't have it
[1:52:52] he didn't have it
[1:52:54] he was my son
[1:52:56] but I knew he didn't have it
[1:52:59] my daughter-in-law was sitting back
[1:53:00] there they said at the back of the tent
[1:53:05] and she was screaming during the
[1:53:06] meetings
[1:53:07] and brother Tom Ray said does she do
[1:53:09] that all the time I said she never did
[1:53:11] it
[1:53:13] she'd never screamed she does on a
[1:53:16] regular basis now
[1:53:19] Hallelujah
[1:53:20] [Applause]
[1:53:28] after the meeting
[1:53:31] we're kind of taking a few days off
[1:53:35] I'm gonna turn my clock off because I'm
[1:53:37] not paying no attention to it no way
[1:53:42] brother Tom Ray's son Joel
[1:53:47] was in the same spot you was in
[1:53:50] and I walked through the door because
[1:53:51] the door
[1:53:54] foreign
[1:53:55] I've heard these stories before I'm
[1:53:57] telling them for a reason because
[1:53:58] there's some backslid kids here
[1:54:02] there's some kids that's not where
[1:54:03] they're at and I want to tell you this
[1:54:05] can be your moment
[1:54:07] and so I'm taking your time
[1:54:11] I'm taking your time to get you in the
[1:54:13] presence of the Lord
[1:54:15] there's nothing more important than
[1:54:17] being here
[1:54:20] this is not a church of convenience
[1:54:22] this is not a church where you come to
[1:54:24] when you feel like it we're getting
[1:54:27] ready for a Rapture here
[1:54:35] I don't care what your family name is
[1:54:37] we're going to be changed here
[1:54:47] God had given three different times
[1:54:50] children to Joanne and brother Tom and
[1:54:54] they couldn't have them
[1:54:56] and they had a prayer cloth that they
[1:54:58] had
[1:54:58] and each time they would go to brother
[1:55:00] biscoll and brother Briscoe would pray
[1:55:02] and they would have their child
[1:55:05] foreign
[1:55:07] somebody broke into their home and they
[1:55:09] stole the prayer cloth they didn't know
[1:55:11] what they stole but I guarantee there
[1:55:13] was children born they was not expected
[1:55:15] [Applause]
[1:55:21] I'm sitting with the youngest that is
[1:55:23] backslid he's away from God he's just
[1:55:26] there because I'm there he's there to
[1:55:28] enjoy a vacation and God orchestrates a
[1:55:31] moment I go to the door because God told
[1:55:34] me to go the door and I opened the door
[1:55:35] and here he comes in flip-flops and
[1:55:37] hairs just bouncing he comes in I said
[1:55:39] come on in
[1:55:41] we go out and sit on the balcony and
[1:55:43] we're watching planes come into the
[1:55:44] water I'm watching
[1:55:47] and I just felt the channel start
[1:55:49] because I felt that little wind
[1:55:51] and I start talking to him
[1:55:53] tell him his life story in detail
[1:55:57] of where he's at
[1:56:00] he was changed
[1:56:02] in that moment
[1:56:05] never to go back and Not only was he
[1:56:09] changed there was a prophecy given over
[1:56:11] top of him in that moment to how blessed
[1:56:14] he would be like the son of Joseph and
[1:56:16] how blessed he would be
[1:56:19] listen he hasn't even reached the top
[1:56:25] he's recognized as one of the top
[1:56:28] employees in his company year after year
[1:56:31] and they keep throwing bonuses on him
[1:56:33] greater than most of our salary is here
[1:56:38] why because God said so
[1:56:41] Ron didn't say so God said so
[1:56:44] [Applause]
[1:56:45] we go to dinner that night we walk out
[1:56:49] you know when somebody says do you want
[1:56:51] to see some really good hiking boots and
[1:56:53] so I Walk This Way I go into a place
[1:56:55] where they've got really good hiking
[1:56:57] boots I would have had to take a loan to
[1:56:59] get them but I walked back out and we're
[1:57:01] just Distributing ourselves up and down
[1:57:03] the up and down there and I look down in
[1:57:06] this busy Street
[1:57:09] and I see brother Tom Ray stop in that
[1:57:12] stance and my son's standing before him
[1:57:16] confessing
[1:57:19] I don't have it
[1:57:21] I know the god of my Mom and Daddy I
[1:57:23] know the god of my grandparents but I
[1:57:25] don't have it I need to know that God
[1:57:29] in that moment
[1:57:34] foreign
[1:57:38] we took one Andrew confession we took
[1:57:41] one Andrew there and we brought another
[1:57:44] Andrew home
[1:57:46] [Music]
[1:57:59] and for your critic I want to just tell
[1:58:02] you no emotion
[1:58:05] it just happened
[1:58:06] but since that time many refillings and
[1:58:10] many emotions and many fire
[1:58:14] so he is the product
[1:58:17] not the son of Ron Spencer but he's a
[1:58:21] reproduct of this message
[1:58:24] I'm going to tell you and make a
[1:58:25] declaration this message works
[1:58:29] [Applause]
[1:58:56] foreign
[1:59:06] you know they contest the bridge
[1:59:10] in Jeffersonville
[1:59:12] say it never happened
[1:59:16] silly people say silly things
[1:59:22] on Judgment day you'll know whether it
[1:59:24] happened or not
[1:59:27] but I'm sitting at the Ramada Inn on the
[1:59:29] 10th floor
[1:59:35] and I'm studying
[1:59:37] and every time I studied I pull the
[1:59:39] curtains back to where I could look at
[1:59:41] that bridge and I think about
[1:59:43] how a country boy like me is sitting on
[1:59:46] the 10th floor of the Ramada and I'm
[1:59:48] studying this message looking at what
[1:59:51] brother Brown talked about
[2:00:01] this church loves brother Kelly
[2:00:03] Hildebrandt
[2:00:05] well the Kelly Hildebrand is one of the
[2:00:07] most precious persons there's ever been
[2:00:09] to me
[2:00:15] his daughter had went through a lot of
[2:00:17] things
[2:00:18] and I just dropped this in she'd been
[2:00:20] T-boned by a car
[2:00:23] and she was in a church
[2:00:25] it's a church of personality
[2:00:29] and they hadn't prayed for her but she
[2:00:31] was going to therapy
[2:00:33] over and over
[2:00:36] she couldn't she couldn't do any of her
[2:00:38] housework
[2:00:39] and they came to a meeting that I was
[2:00:41] preaching I
[2:00:44] huh and their pastor had ostracized
[2:00:49] brother Kelly to the point until his
[2:00:51] daughter
[2:00:52] had never heard Kelly preach
[2:00:55] for years
[2:00:57] I think what a shame
[2:01:00] what a shame
[2:01:02] what a jealous devil
[2:01:10] I got in the car after the meeting it
[2:01:12] was cold that night
[2:01:14] and I see Melody standing in there and I
[2:01:16] know the story of
[2:01:18] of her being in that accident and her
[2:01:20] being in a horrible condition I heard
[2:01:22] that boy said go pray for her
[2:01:25] I don't know if she'll let me pray for
[2:01:28] her I don't know if she'll let me do
[2:01:30] anything I don't know if she'll rebuke
[2:01:31] me but I stepped into that into that
[2:01:34] glass doors and step in and I step right
[2:01:37] beside wait till their conversation
[2:01:39] calms down you were there and I wait to
[2:01:43] the conversation and I said the Lord
[2:01:45] spoke to me when I was sitting in the
[2:01:46] front seat of the car
[2:01:48] go pray for you
[2:01:51] and she said well no one's did that I'd
[2:01:54] like that
[2:01:55] and I began to pray for her
[2:01:58] let me just say in that moment she
[2:02:02] became well
[2:02:09] Brother Kelly's telling me you know that
[2:02:12] she's come to the spot to where she's
[2:02:14] going to leave that church
[2:02:16] of personality and she's going to walk
[2:02:19] away she's been there a long time she's
[2:02:21] got two boys she knows that this is
[2:02:24] going to be a crucial decision she's
[2:02:26] going to go to her daddy's Church
[2:02:29] she don't know how's the people's going
[2:02:31] to look at her she's going to go and
[2:02:33] she's going to be a part of it
[2:02:35] and I'm going to tell you now she's been
[2:02:37] a widow for a couple of years maybe I
[2:02:39] don't know the exact time
[2:02:42] and and and and brother Kelly reads me
[2:02:45] she may not even know this but he reads
[2:02:47] me what she's going to say at the end of
[2:02:51] it he says brother Ron do you think
[2:02:53] that's okay I said it's not only okay
[2:02:55] and I felt the presence of the Lord
[2:02:59] I felt the presence of the Lord
[2:03:02] I said now God will give her a husband
[2:03:05] and he'll be a prince
[2:03:11] brother on that you know when I hear
[2:03:13] that coming forth I Go whoo
[2:03:16] whoo
[2:03:19] listen I never I'm either telling you
[2:03:22] prophecy or I'm telling you a lie
[2:03:26] when I'm sitting with you at the table
[2:03:27] either you're the man
[2:03:30] that will believe me that you're the man
[2:03:32] in the plane
[2:03:34] or the voice that's whispered into my
[2:03:36] ears been deceiving me
[2:03:39] and you'll have nothing more to do with
[2:03:41] me after I tell the story or you'll
[2:03:43] become one of my best friends
[2:03:59] I stood in the living room with brother
[2:04:01] Thomas
[2:04:02] and he said pray for Melissa this
[2:04:07] I had a vision of you
[2:04:10] over three years ago a month before
[2:04:12] cancer
[2:04:14] and the Lord showed me at the bottom of
[2:04:16] a pit that you were standing there in
[2:04:18] the light and I asked you it's are you
[2:04:19] ready to go home
[2:04:21] and I told Thomas I said I had a vision
[2:04:23] of her don't worry she's coming home
[2:04:27] God's not worried about time he's not
[2:04:30] worried about your stuff
[2:04:35] it's the Eternal part
[2:04:38] it's Eternal pack
[2:04:41] that's what he's concerned with
[2:04:43] [Applause]
[2:05:01] I called brother Kelly in three weeks
[2:05:05] and I said how are things
[2:05:09] and he just laughed
[2:05:12] he said I'll never forget his words so a
[2:05:16] lot been going on here brother Ron

[2:05:38] I asked him I said tell me that again
[2:05:41] she's engaged
[2:05:46] once you get married she's going to get

[2:07:20] near his mother and father he had a job
[2:07:28] I come in for the meeting
[2:07:30] and I made him
[2:07:32] it's about all I do is meeting
[2:07:35] I think it's overwhelming I think it's
[2:07:36] nice
[2:07:37] I can't believe what's happened
[2:07:39] you know so when people ask me about the
[2:07:41] bridge
[2:07:42] I have no problem with that bridge
[2:07:46] let me tell you a story I just told you
[2:07:51] and if God can bring a prince into her
[2:07:53] life
[2:07:54] I have no doubt about a bridge
[2:08:00] at four o'clock the next morning
[2:08:04] I feel a presence in the room I wake up
[2:08:07] listen
[2:08:09] listen it takes God to wake me up
[2:08:12] or Mother Nature
[2:08:14] you know what I'm talking about
[2:08:21] I feel him in the room and I stand and
[2:08:24] we're right beside of the Civic Center
[2:08:27] at a hotel I don't know the name of that
[2:08:29] hotel I just know that they Park cars
[2:08:32] underneath of it and I'm really glad
[2:08:34] brother Kelly doesn't put us there
[2:08:36] anymore
[2:08:37] but any
[2:08:40] Holiday Inn
[2:08:42] Express well there you are
[2:08:46] details don't matter too much on that
[2:08:48] situation but I'm standing watching it's
[2:08:51] a rainy night
[2:08:52] and I'm watching people come out of that
[2:08:54] Civic Center at four o'clock in the
[2:08:56] morning you know in the city there's
[2:08:57] everything moving you know and I'm
[2:08:59] watching people walking through the
[2:09:01] parking lot
[2:09:02] all I know he's woke me up now for a
[2:09:04] reason
[2:09:05] pay attention
[2:09:07] and he speaks to me and he said
[2:09:10] tell Calvin
[2:09:12] not to not to move those boys
[2:09:15] but for him to move here
[2:09:21] you know now the Lord is actually
[2:09:24] in the business
[2:09:26] of your life
[2:09:28] he's in your choices
[2:09:31] you catching that
[2:09:32] and so
[2:09:35] I just say Lord
[2:09:37] I'm Kelly's friend he's not going to
[2:09:39] take that from me
[2:09:40] you're going to have to give me
[2:09:42] something
[2:09:43] that he will know that that came from
[2:09:47] you you're gonna have to give me
[2:09:48] something though only he knows
[2:09:51] so I dropped it in my heart
[2:09:55] so now I've got to wait all day
[2:09:57] we're around each other we're we're
[2:09:59] doing different things and I know I got
[2:10:02] a message and I got to wait for the
[2:10:03] right time
[2:10:05] so I walk into the office
[2:10:07] with brother Kelly
[2:10:10] and he said would you like to go down
[2:10:11] and pray with the musicians he said
[2:10:13] Calvin's playing tonight I said I sure
[2:10:15] would but before I go down
[2:10:19] I need to tell you something
[2:10:22] the Lord woke me up this morning and I
[2:10:25] told him what I've just told you and
[2:10:27] brother Kelly drops to the floor
[2:10:31] just weeping
[2:10:35] now look at him man I go you got to get
[2:10:37] yourself together
[2:10:41] and that's exactly what I told you you
[2:10:43] got to get yourself together
[2:10:45] so when I go down it's a circle of
[2:10:47] musicians and I go to work brother
[2:10:49] Calvin is come come
[2:10:53] no he's getting ready to get a life
[2:10:55] change and so are you
[2:10:58] and so Kelvin is standing beside of me
[2:11:01] he's about your height
[2:11:03] tall handsome good-looking
[2:11:11] that's the reason I can't grow a beard
[2:11:13] you know that
[2:11:15] and so
[2:11:16] so anyway
[2:11:19] I got to deliver a message but I can
[2:11:21] only do it to him
[2:11:23] so we we pray
[2:11:25] and brother Kelly is crying after the
[2:11:29] prayer
[2:11:29] and they start to dispersing and I just
[2:11:32] hold his hand
[2:11:35] and I begin to talk to him
[2:11:40] and I said you know
[2:11:43] you know me as Kelly's friend this is
[2:11:45] the first time you've ever met me yeah
[2:11:48] that's right
[2:11:49] yeah probably never heard me preach
[2:11:52] before yeah that's right
[2:11:54] I said but the Lord woke me up and I
[2:11:56] rehearsed the story The Lord woke me up
[2:11:58] this morning and I was watching
[2:12:01] and I said you don't have to take this
[2:12:03] from me as Kelly's friend
[2:12:06] and I tell him this I said but the Lord
[2:12:08] I told him if I
[2:12:11] tell you this
[2:12:13] as Kelly's friend
[2:12:15] he'll just take it as Kelly's friend but
[2:12:18] I asked the Lord for a special thing
[2:12:20] I've never I've never told that ever
[2:12:22] again and won't today
[2:12:24] and I turned to him and I tell him what

[2:12:46] hours you imagine
[2:12:49] the effort that was already involved

[2:13:01] her we're not moving
[2:13:15] now listen if it comes from the words of
