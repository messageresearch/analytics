[46:06] amen just good to be in the house of the
[46:08] lord i woke up this morning had a
[46:11] wonderful morning and
[46:12] it was when i walked into my office this
[46:14] morning it was as though
[46:16] he had been waiting on me to come
[46:19] and sister connie came in after maybe an
[46:22] hour and a half maybe something like
[46:24] that and
[46:25] just tears running down my cheeks she
[46:27] said what's wrong i said
[46:29] it's all right it's not wrong and amen
[46:32] and so we just are so thankful for that
[46:35] amen we're just you know i want to be
[46:37] where he's at
[46:39] you know you can go somewhere where he
[46:41] has been
[46:43] spent a lot of time there but that's
[46:45] where he's been
[46:47] and we can project where he's going to
[46:49] be at
[46:51] but i really want to be where he is in
[46:53] the i am and so
[46:55] we're so thankful for that i i don't
[46:57] know if we can actually put that into
[46:59] words
[46:59] i'd like to try to do that a little bit
[47:01] today amen because i
[47:04] feel like we're living in some very
[47:05] special times
[47:07] i for some of us was able to go to
[47:10] brother sean martin's tent meeting
[47:12] and it was kind of an uh an unexpected
[47:14] type of a thing but
[47:16] i uh kind of the way it all turned out
[47:19] it was a
[47:21] the place where they have chosen to put
[47:24] the tent at and have his meeting at
[47:29] they invited me to be the speaker a few
[47:31] years ago when it first started
[47:33] i'll never forget what the lord spoke to
[47:37] me
[47:38] to speak at that first service
[47:41] this is the lord's doing and i want to i
[47:44] want to
[47:45] i want to use that as a text this
[47:46] morning this is the lord's doing
[47:51] as i sat with my dad at the tent uh
[47:54] friday evening he just kind of looked
[47:57] over at me and he said
[47:59] do you know this very ground
[48:02] as a little boy i was putting tomatoes
[48:05] in
[48:07] this very place right here we put
[48:09] tomatoes in
[48:10] and i could see it in dad's eyes he was
[48:12] just kind of
[48:14] he was just kind of going back as a
[48:15] little boy and now here's the tent
[48:18] setting and on friday evening i think it
[48:21] was about 600 people there and so
[48:24] and just had glorious services
[48:27] and so we're just so thankful for that
[48:29] and what god is doing
[48:31] i i just want to share something with
[48:33] you with god's preparing
[48:35] it's kind of like the ground that we're
[48:36] standing on
[48:40] brother homer had a vision of this place
[48:43] and how it would be and we he brought
[48:46] many of us up on the hill
[48:48] here before we started cutting you cut
[48:50] the trees down and then
[48:51] the land was cut off to where the
[48:53] building could be set
[48:55] and a vision was there god had showed
[48:58] him he was going to have a place here
[49:00] and what a front yard that we've got
[49:03] and and so i think about this place
[49:07] this is not a place that a man chose
[49:10] amen are you with me
[49:14] this is a place that god chose
[49:18] i i like to be where god's act
[49:21] you can build a lot of buildings but i
[49:23] want to be where he's
[49:24] at and so i thought i i gave it some
[49:28] great thought yesterday as i
[49:30] it just kept coming to me and this is
[49:32] just to be part of the service here if
[49:34] you can make it that way
[49:36] and i remember i remember my father
[49:39] my my grandmother was quite a spiritual
[49:42] woman and she saw
[49:43] visions and and
[49:46] my grandfather they had 13 children and
[49:49] he had bought that piece of property for
[49:52] 100
[49:53] an acre 110 acres
[49:58] and so he decided to sell it because he
[50:00] was a mover
[50:01] and he decided to sell it and she began
[50:04] to pray
[50:05] even on the auction day because they
[50:09] needed that land to have
[50:10] food and and they needed that land to
[50:13] raise those 13
[50:14] children and you know he would just had
[50:17] a whim he's going to sell it
[50:19] and she began to pray and an angel came
[50:22] in the room with her
[50:24] while she was praying and she just
[50:26] sprawled herself out across that
[50:28] bed and she is praying and the
[50:31] auction literally stalled
[50:35] and the auctioneer couldn't get a person
[50:38] to bid
[50:42] on the littlest item not a person and
[50:45] that place is just
[50:46] full of people and not a person would
[50:49] bid
[50:52] i'll tell you because there was a woman
[50:54] in the room
[50:56] with an angel of the lord and he was
[50:59] preserving that property
[51:03] for that meeting amen
[51:06] hallelujah you see god knows what he's
[51:09] doing he knows what he's going to do on
[51:11] this hill
[51:13] amen and so we're just so thoughtful
[51:16] we're so thankful for that
[51:18] i thought if brother homer could look
[51:20] over the balcony last night
[51:23] i'm sure he would be really pleased
[51:27] my grandmother would would be one of the
[51:30] my dad would come to know the message in
[51:32] about 1960
[51:35] 61 he would come to know the message and
[51:38] and he was fervent and he went home and
[51:40] introduced the message to our family
[51:43] to that's family to his family
[51:46] his mother had had a vision of brother
[51:48] branham
[51:50] never seen him in her life that he would
[51:52] be elijah the prophet
[51:54] and when he handed her a book
[51:57] there was brother branham's picture on
[52:00] the book and she said
[52:01] that's the man that's elijah so i'm
[52:04] going to believe what he's got to say
[52:07] i think it's neat how god does business
[52:09] and so
[52:10] amen and so amen i'm carrying that book
[52:14] with me i'll be carrying it with me the
[52:15] rest of my life
[52:17] because remember here a few weeks ago in
[52:19] the dream brother branham
[52:21] i i saw him and he was in a in a whitish
[52:23] suit
[52:24] and he was and he had spoke we were at
[52:27] the meeting and i was sitting
[52:29] i was sitting about right there and when
[52:32] he got done
[52:33] speaking he walked over to me and
[52:36] he handed me the book the way of a true
[52:38] prophet
[52:39] and he just patted me on the cheek and
[52:41] he said ron you're going to be well
[52:44] amen so i'm carrying it with me and so
[52:48] i want to share a couple things with you
[52:50] before i go but go to speak this morning
[52:55] we want to remind you of brother joe
[52:57] green's meeting
[52:58] he's going to have it this year um it's
[53:02] going to be the first tuesday of august
[53:05] uh i i'm just going to i'm just going to
[53:07] kind of
[53:08] throw this out because they haven't
[53:10] really came to a thing but it looks like
[53:12] it's going to be in his church
[53:15] and so um because of the
[53:19] the place there that where they have
[53:20] been having the meeting
[53:22] has so many rules until they just
[53:25] it's just almost impossible to have a
[53:27] meeting there
[53:28] and so brother joe green is going to
[53:30] have a meeting the first
[53:32] it will start the first tuesday of
[53:34] august and i don't know exactly that
[53:36] date i
[53:37] i right now but first tuesday of august
[53:40] and somebody that's very familiar to you
[53:43] will be one of the speakers
[53:44] and brother donny reagan will be the
[53:46] other speaker
[53:48] and um and so i'll be the speaker as
[53:51] well with brother donnie reagan
[53:55] we feel to have our labor day meetings
[53:57] this year
[54:00] [Applause]

[54:12] brother timothy pruitt will be one of
[54:14] the speakers

[54:28] that
[54:29] i just feel a sense of urgency as we're
[54:31] just nearing the end time and
[54:33] it's all coming to a very close end i
[54:37] you know i
[54:38] i i just feel that way and i and you
[54:41] know i know our buildings sometimes
[54:42] don't hold everybody but
[54:44] i remember as a little boy standing
[54:47] outside of buildings and
[54:48] when we'd have meetings and they were
[54:50] much smaller than this
[54:52] and dad and mom would have us standing
[54:54] outside and we'd listen just
[54:56] we'd stand attentively standing outside
[54:59] listening to the service and clapping
[55:02] and having church standing outside and
[55:05] listening to the preachers because we
[55:06] couldn't get in
[55:08] and you know i i never heard nobody
[55:11] complain
[55:11] it wasn't inconvenient just a hunger in
[55:14] our heart for god and so
[55:17] amen so we're i'm not expecting you know
[55:20] i don't know what to expect in this cove
[55:23] generation and
[55:24] and all i can say is if you're sick stay
[55:27] home so
[55:28] you know that's the best i know how to
[55:30] do i i just don't know but
[55:33] the rapture is not going to wait on
[55:34] covet
[55:35] [Applause]

[59:38] him to get it
[59:40] amen i'd like to speak to you on this
[59:44] moment of time
[59:46] and in psalms 118
[59:50] and verse 22
[59:53] the stone which the builders refused
[59:57] is become the head of the corner
[1:00:01] and if the jewish world could have only
[1:00:03] recognized that scripture
[1:00:05] they'd have never crucified jesus christ
[1:00:08] amen this is the lord's doing
[1:00:14] it is marvelous in our eyes
[1:00:18] this is the day which the lord hath made
[1:00:22] and we will rejoice and be glad in it
[1:00:25] maybe you have a need this morning you
[1:00:27] just say lord would you remember me
[1:00:30] as you pass by this way lord jesus we
[1:00:33] love you with all of our hearts today
[1:00:35] and
[1:00:35] we're so thankful for your goodness and
[1:00:37] mercy upon our lives
[1:00:40] we ask you just now as we're very aware
[1:00:43] of your presence that you would come and
[1:00:45] speak to our hearts and bless this
[1:00:48] audience now
[1:00:49] the audience that's watching all over
[1:00:52] the world
[1:00:53] we ask you that you'd minister to them
[1:00:55] and their
[1:00:56] very pivotal need in jesus christ's name
[1:00:59] we pray
[1:01:00] amen and amen and amen you can be seated
[1:01:06] i think about moments of time and
[1:01:09] sometimes we
[1:01:11] sometimes things happen in a very
[1:01:13] supernatural way
[1:01:15] it's kind of like sitting in a service
[1:01:18] like what we're
[1:01:19] listening to last night and or maybe
[1:01:23] in your past that you've listened to and
[1:01:25] a person
[1:01:26] sitting beside you you seem to see be
[1:01:28] bored
[1:01:30] and yet you feel like you're almost in
[1:01:36] rapture i'll say that again
[1:01:40] it's kind of like sitting in a service
[1:01:42] like you said last night
[1:01:46] or maybe in your past
[1:01:49] and there you're studying and maybe
[1:01:51] somebody sit beside of you seems to be
[1:01:53] bored
[1:01:55] and you feel like you're in rapture
[1:02:00] sounded better yeah
[1:02:03] now that's kind of what happens in the
[1:02:05] history of time
[1:02:08] prophecy becomes fulfilled
[1:02:11] and brother brandon would speak a sermon
[1:02:14] called
[1:02:14] modern events made
[1:02:17] clear by prophecy
[1:02:21] because we can't recognize what's going
[1:02:24] on
[1:02:24] until we look at the prophetic word and
[1:02:27] see
[1:02:28] we are living in the vision
[1:02:32] of the word of god and realize
[1:02:35] by the prophecy that we're here
[1:02:39] yeah now it's easy when you're standing
[1:02:42] as as brother branham was standing with
[1:02:44] a
[1:02:44] 42 inch caribou and he told about it for
[1:02:47] years
[1:02:48] of how it was going to be in the silver
[1:02:50] tip grizzly bear
[1:02:52] but you didn't realize you was on the
[1:02:54] hunt
[1:02:55] until the animal was on the ground and
[1:02:58] you're measuring it
[1:02:59] yeah and you realize you're standing in
[1:03:02] a green checkered shirt
[1:03:03] yeah you're in the vision
[1:03:08] the disciples jesus would say now go get
[1:03:10] me a cult
[1:03:12] the fall of an ass now you know that
[1:03:15] nobody's ever been able to ride
[1:03:18] an animal like that because it's never
[1:03:20] it's never had a human being on it
[1:03:23] and it's just absolutely supernatural
[1:03:26] it's a supernatural event especially
[1:03:28] amongst the amish
[1:03:30] they consider it one of the greatest
[1:03:31] events in history
[1:03:33] that jesus was able to get on a cult the
[1:03:36] fall of an ass
[1:03:37] because no one no man can get on that
[1:03:40] because of its wild nature
[1:03:42] yeah and and jesus and jesus said go get
[1:03:46] a cult
[1:03:47] and he says the man will will give it to
[1:03:49] you
[1:03:51] amen because he knows the prophecy is
[1:03:54] going to be fulfilled
[1:03:56] and the man will give it to you and they
[1:03:59] come and they bring him and they
[1:04:01] they begin to write off and and people
[1:04:03] get under an anointing
[1:04:07] an anointing begins to take place and
[1:04:10] people begin to worship him
[1:04:12] hosanna to the king and they began to
[1:04:15] pull down
[1:04:16] branches and and began to scream out why
[1:04:20] why the pharisees and sanchez should
[1:04:22] have rejoiced with them
[1:04:24] but they wanted the people to quiet down
[1:04:26] yeah
[1:04:28] there was one group of people
[1:04:29] recognizing he's the king and he's
[1:04:32] coming
[1:04:33] there was another one
[1:04:36] that was turning them down and it's only
[1:04:39] seven days
[1:04:42] a week and he'll be crucified
[1:04:48] literally go to the judgment hall
[1:04:50] crucified
[1:04:52] and then resurrect it don't take god a
[1:04:56] long time
[1:04:58] so we realize that we must be aware of
[1:05:02] our moment of time
[1:05:05] jesus as i was just just sharing with
[1:05:08] you in that
[1:05:09] that exhortation jesus was standing at
[1:05:12] the judgment hall
[1:05:15] and pilate asked him
[1:05:19] whence art thou but jesus gave him no
[1:05:23] answer
[1:05:26] sometimes it's more powerful to just
[1:05:29] stand still
[1:05:31] than it is to give the devil to our
[1:05:34] sermon amen
[1:05:37] because jesus could have given him every
[1:05:39] secret in the world
[1:05:42] but he just held himself
[1:05:46] and then the pilot said unto him
[1:05:49] speakest thou not of them to me
[1:05:52] knowest not that i have power
[1:05:55] to crucify thee in power to release thee
[1:06:00] and jesus answered thou
[1:06:03] couldest have no power
[1:06:07] at all against me except it was
[1:06:10] given thee from above
[1:06:16] amen
[1:06:18] one king speaking to another
[1:06:21] amen it was a moment of time
[1:06:27] now from that event i want you to notice
[1:06:29] what the subscription
[1:06:33] the super subscription that they wrote
[1:06:36] over him
[1:06:37] in luke 23 and verse 33 38
[1:06:42] and a super scription
[1:06:45] also was written over him in letters of
[1:06:48] greek
[1:06:49] and latin and hebrew
[1:06:53] this is the king of jews
[1:07:00] and one of the mouth factors which were
[1:07:02] hanging
[1:07:03] railed at him saying if thou be the
[1:07:06] christ
[1:07:08] save thyself and us
[1:07:12] but the ant but the other answered
[1:07:14] rebuked him
[1:07:15] saying dost thou not fear god
[1:07:20] seeth thou art in the same condition
[1:07:24] amen and we indeed justly for
[1:07:28] we received the due reward of our deeds
[1:07:32] but this man have done nothing
[1:07:35] amiss are you with me now
[1:07:40] and he said it to give jesus
[1:07:43] lord remember me
[1:07:48] when thou comest into thy kingdom
[1:07:51] never heard a sermon never saw a miracle
[1:07:56] but he's in a moment
[1:07:59] that's all it takes a moment an eternal
[1:08:03] moment when time becomes eternal
[1:08:06] in your moment maybe sitting in a pew
[1:08:09] maybe dragging your car maybe getting
[1:08:12] out of bed
[1:08:13] and the sweep of the holy ghost comes
[1:08:15] right into your life
[1:08:17] and you recognize this is more than a
[1:08:20] man
[1:08:20] [Applause]
[1:08:22] amen hallelujah
[1:08:24] now notice these next words because
[1:08:26] they're incredible
[1:08:27] and jesus said unto him verily
[1:08:31] i say unto thee today
[1:08:36] shalt thou be with me
[1:08:39] in paradise
[1:08:41] [Applause]
[1:08:43] jesus says some powerful words in luke
[1:08:46] chapter 17 and i'm sorry to just come
[1:08:48] from one scripture to another
[1:08:50] but we'll preach in just a few moments
[1:08:53] in luke 17 and verse 29 he says
[1:08:57] in the same day now notice those words
[1:09:01] in the same day that lot
[1:09:05] went out of sodom it rained
[1:09:08] fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:09:12] and destroyed them all
[1:09:16] god sent a messenger of
[1:09:19] warning to that that that
[1:09:23] huge city he sent up because
[1:09:26] god doesn't do anything until he first
[1:09:28] sends a warning
[1:09:30] and he sends a warning to lot to leave
[1:09:35] are you with me now and in the same day
[1:09:39] lot went out of sodom it rained fire and
[1:09:42] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[1:09:46] all even thus shall it be
[1:09:51] in the day when the son of man is
[1:09:54] revealed
[1:09:55] living in that day and in that day
[1:09:59] he shall he he which shall be upon the
[1:10:03] house top
[1:10:04] and his stuff in his house let him not
[1:10:07] come down to take it away
[1:10:09] and and he that is in the field let him
[1:10:13] likewise not return
[1:10:14] back and he says this incredible
[1:10:18] incredible scripture now remember
[1:10:21] lot's wife
[1:10:23] [Applause]
[1:10:25] whosoever shall seek to save his life
[1:10:28] shall lose it and whosoever shall
[1:10:30] save shall lose his life shall preserve
[1:10:32] him
[1:10:33] and i tell you that the night that there
[1:10:36] shall be
[1:10:37] two men in the bed one shall be taken
[1:10:40] and the other
[1:10:40] left two women shall be grinding
[1:10:44] together and one shall be taken
[1:10:47] and the other left two men shall be in
[1:10:50] the field
[1:10:51] one shall be taken and the other left
[1:10:56] and they answered and said unto him
[1:10:58] where lord
[1:11:00] we want to be in the rapture where is he
[1:11:03] going to be
[1:11:04] at we want to be gathered
[1:11:07] and he said unto them whether so ever
[1:11:10] the body is
[1:11:11] through the eagles
[1:11:14] be gathered together i want to ask you
[1:11:18] who gathered us here
[1:11:22] amen we've talked about this place but
[1:11:25] who gathered us here
[1:11:27] not just here but around the world
[1:11:31] are you with me in india where all of
[1:11:34] that
[1:11:35] that that is happening there's there's
[1:11:37] large
[1:11:38] churches there who gathered them
[1:11:42] who gathered them and all the nations of
[1:11:45] the earth
[1:11:46] who gathered them i'll tell you god
[1:11:48] gathered him
[1:11:49] [Applause]
[1:11:52] you're living in the day when israel was
[1:11:54] restored as a nation
[1:11:56] i want you to know god scattered them
[1:12:00] the scripture prophecy that he would
[1:12:02] stagger them in all the earth
[1:12:04] they went to russia they went all over
[1:12:07] they went to australia they came to
[1:12:09] america
[1:12:10] they went to canada listen and they just
[1:12:13] went
[1:12:13] all over because god dispersed those
[1:12:16] jews all
[1:12:20] all over the earth and they were
[1:12:22] successful
[1:12:25] because god gave them a promise they
[1:12:28] were successful wherever they went
[1:12:40] but if you'll remember when they were
[1:12:43] standing on the ground
[1:12:45] and jesus was in the air
[1:12:49] they said let his blood be on us
[1:12:52] they didn't know what they were asking
[1:12:56] they did not know what they were asking
[1:13:00] no way could they have fathom in their
[1:13:02] mind
[1:13:04] almost over 6 million of them
[1:13:08] would be gathered and put in torture
[1:13:10] chambers
[1:13:12] and destroyed amen
[1:13:17] the words that brother branham would use
[1:13:20] that it was the tender
[1:13:22] hand of jehovah
[1:13:26] but we find in the seals that they were
[1:13:28] given white robes
[1:13:31] yes are you with me they didn't know
[1:13:33] what they did and jesus
[1:13:35] forgave them america are you with
[1:13:38] me god god's got it all in this planet
[1:13:45] that's a amen thing brother ron let me
[1:13:47] just say this to you
[1:13:49] eternal life is more important than this
[1:13:52] temporary life
[1:13:56] however we leave it it's if i want
[1:13:59] eternal
[1:14:00] life more than anything those jews begin
[1:14:04] to gather back to
[1:14:05] a nation that was not a nation
[1:14:09] and god began to gather them back
[1:14:11] because it was the season of gathering
[1:14:14] and they left their businesses they left
[1:14:16] their homes they left their places
[1:14:18] and to come back to that land amen
[1:14:22] listen no doubt they were farmers in
[1:14:26] another place but when they came back to
[1:14:28] the land
[1:14:29] the percentages of their week was 30
[1:14:31] percent better
[1:14:32] because they were in the land their cows
[1:14:36] gave better milk because they were in
[1:14:38] the land
[1:14:39] listen i'm not just giving you some
[1:14:41] hokey poke story
[1:14:43] god brought those jews back to the land
[1:14:48] and he promised it
[1:14:53] and i want to say this to you god's
[1:14:55] watching over them
[1:14:57] [Applause]
[1:14:59] he's watching over them and nation after
[1:15:02] nation has tried to destroy them over
[1:15:05] and over again
[1:15:06] but i have news for you if god fights
[1:15:08] your back
[1:15:12] there's not a nation on the earth
[1:15:15] can destroy that group
[1:15:19] are you with them because of the messiah
[1:15:22] that came to them 2
[1:15:23] 000 years ago is going to return again
[1:15:28] and listen we're going to be with him
[1:15:39] [Applause]
[1:15:44] so as much as we are looking for rapture
[1:15:48] and watching as this revival that's
[1:15:50] happening
[1:15:51] in the bride of jesus christ not just
[1:15:54] here
[1:15:55] not just what we witnessed this week
[1:15:57] that brother sean martin's
[1:15:59] not just what we've been witnessing
[1:16:02] listen
[1:16:03] this is not built by man amen
[1:16:06] let me just share this with you in a
[1:16:08] denominational realm
[1:16:10] when they had revival they would the
[1:16:13] move would come among them
[1:16:15] with john wesley or maybe
[1:16:19] moody or those men when the move of god
[1:16:22] that
[1:16:23] wind jesus would use the term the wind
[1:16:26] bloweth where it lifteth
[1:16:28] no man know where it's come from or even
[1:16:30] where it goes
[1:16:31] and you can't explain it revival you
[1:16:34] just can't explain
[1:16:36] all you do is you enjoy the moment
[1:16:39] [Music]
[1:16:41] get in the moment when you see god
[1:16:43] moving you get in
[1:16:44] amen you get in don't stand and look at
[1:16:47] it don't be an observer you get in
[1:16:50] well i don't know what's going on here
[1:16:52] i'll tell you god's among us
[1:16:55] and it's not my this god himself
[1:17:05] the word is anchored in the souls of the
[1:17:09] [Applause]
[1:17:14] believers
[1:17:22] god has predestinated a bride
[1:17:27] that'll be born of his bone life of his
[1:17:30] life
[1:17:30] power of his power
[1:17:36] in moody's day or wesley's day the
[1:17:38] revival would come and
[1:17:40] generally the season of revival was
[1:17:41] about three years
[1:17:43] then men would grab a hold of it
[1:17:47] brother would use this term how can we
[1:17:50] preserve it
[1:17:52] let me just say anytime a man or a board
[1:17:56] gets a hold of a church
[1:17:59] that church becomes dead and formal
[1:18:05] listen this message should never become
[1:18:08] formal to us
[1:18:11] this message is more than books it's
[1:18:14] more than 10
[1:18:15] seconds more than buildings and all the
[1:18:19] orchestra that it takes to have a
[1:18:20] service it's more than all of those
[1:18:23] things
[1:18:24] is
[1:18:26] [Applause]
[1:18:31] hallelujah now
[1:18:34] let me just share i and i want to go
[1:18:36] back and i forgive me for just a little
[1:18:38] bit but
[1:18:40] in hebrews chapter 11 individuals had
[1:18:42] revivals
[1:18:44] and now faith is the substance of things
[1:18:46] hoped for
[1:18:47] the evidence of things not seen right
[1:18:51] for by it the owners obtained a good
[1:18:53] report
[1:18:54] through faith we understand that the
[1:18:58] worlds were framed by the word of god so
[1:19:01] that things
[1:19:02] which are seen were not made of things
[1:19:06] which do appeal now that's got to become
[1:19:10] that's got to become personal revelation
[1:19:14] now we can read of abel got a revelation
[1:19:17] that it was going to take blood
[1:19:20] by faith he got a revelation
[1:19:23] to get back to god i've got to have a
[1:19:26] blood sacrifice
[1:19:28] are you with me now enoch was the
[1:19:31] sabbath from adam
[1:19:34] he got a revelation
[1:19:38] that god wrote the in the heavens the
[1:19:41] first
[1:19:41] bible and the scripture
[1:19:45] said it was about 60 years that enoch
[1:19:48] walked of his own accord but there was
[1:19:50] 300 years
[1:19:53] that enoch walked perfectly with god
[1:19:58] listen listen there were millions and
[1:20:01] maybe even
[1:20:02] billions of people on the earth but god
[1:20:04] was having fellowship with enoch
[1:20:07] and he was going to be a type of you
[1:20:10] [Applause]
[1:20:12] and he was going to take rapture and
[1:20:15] would not
[1:20:16] taste death
[1:20:21] don't talk about his family it don't
[1:20:24] talk about his cousins
[1:20:26] it's enoch and here's the revelation you
[1:20:29] gotta have
[1:20:30] if there's one going in virginia
[1:20:35] [Music]
[1:20:39] don't you get your eyes on nobody even
[1:20:41] sitting close to you
[1:20:43] they fail me they make mistakes you're
[1:20:46] looking at the wrong thing
[1:20:48] you've got to keep your eyes on jesus
[1:20:50] [Applause]
[1:20:53] don't you dare come to this church and
[1:20:54] just become a community
[1:20:58] member
[1:21:02] and we're here for an hour and a half
[1:21:26] is
[1:21:36] [Applause]
[1:21:44] abraham is mentioned in hebrews 11
[1:21:48] sarah's mentioned listen as the older
[1:21:51] they got the more impossible
[1:21:53] that it became i hear the murmurs of
[1:21:57] people say well
[1:21:59] brother brown's been gone a long time
[1:22:00] and we're still here

[1:22:05] waiting on you
[1:22:06] [Applause]
[1:22:09] he was waiting on you some of you was
[1:22:11] not born in 1977.
[1:22:14] some of you were not born in 1965
[1:22:17] and listen god will not leave a one
[1:22:23] [Music]
[1:22:25] that's the kind of businessman brother
[1:22:27] steve that
[1:22:29] in all of these trillion of people
[1:22:32] that is upon the earth he can have a
[1:22:35] rapture
[1:22:36] and not leave one
[1:22:40] of his children here to go through the
[1:22:42] tribulation period
[1:22:44] [Applause]
[1:22:48] now understand this just like with sodom
[1:22:53] he had to send this earth a messenger
[1:22:57] right before the coming of the great
[1:23:00] and the dreadful day of the lord
[1:23:05] now listen that messenger is to awaken
[1:23:08] the bride right now let me just say
[1:23:12] if this message didn't await you
[1:23:15] there's not another one coming amen
[1:23:20] to the gentile people we're not looking
[1:23:23] for another elijah

[1:23:37] all the thoughts
[1:23:39] in brother brown
[1:23:43] use that same microscope on yourself and
[1:23:46] then you'll get right with god
[1:23:48] [Applause]
[1:23:51] amen did you let's just just just think
[1:23:54] about it for a moment let's settle that
[1:23:56] question
[1:23:57] a lie uh listen brother branham made
[1:24:00] mistakes and he was very honest and told
[1:24:02] us that
[1:24:03] but i wasn't falling in love with
[1:24:05] william brown i was falling in love with
[1:24:07] jesus christ
[1:24:08] [Applause]
[1:24:12] brother branham would have killed six
[1:24:14] boys
[1:24:17] had not god stopped him from
[1:24:20] shooting amen the gun wouldn't go off
[1:24:24] and they went running off and once they
[1:24:27] got out of the scene the gun started
[1:24:29] shooting
[1:24:31] god preserved him
[1:24:32] [Applause]
[1:24:36] are you with me don't that scare you off
[1:24:38] brother ron
[1:24:40] no i read the bible and the bible talks
[1:24:43] about moses
[1:24:45] and he was a murderer
[1:24:49] but he wrote the first five books of the
[1:24:52] bible
[1:24:54] are you with me it wasn't moses that the
[1:24:57] people were falling in love with
[1:24:59] it was jehovah and i used all of that to
[1:25:03] tell you
[1:25:04] don't you fall in love with brother
[1:25:06] brown himself
[1:25:08] you fall in love with jesus christ

[1:25:37] resurrection
[1:25:39] and the rapture
[1:25:55] [Applause]
[1:26:06] amen

[1:26:20] names
[1:26:22] here's what i'd like to say brother paul

[1:26:50] like my name written in there somewhere
[1:26:53] ron spencer lived in laodicea he was
[1:26:56] predestinated to live in laodicea
[1:26:58] and god built him in a way and gave him
[1:27:00] a message that he could live in laodicea
[1:27:03] and overcome
[1:27:04] [Applause]
[1:27:08] are you with me now

[1:27:25] and we are also compassed about was so
[1:27:28] great a cloud of witnesses
[1:27:31] and we can put what a couple hundred
[1:27:34] names from this local body
[1:27:38] that are in the scripture hey listen
[1:27:41] when they went into the ground they were
[1:27:44] looking for the coming of the lord
[1:27:49] the man that had the vision of this
[1:27:50] church in this place and worked so hard
[1:27:55] just ran out of time his faith didn't
[1:27:58] fail
[1:27:59] his revelation didn't fail him the
[1:28:03] message didn't fail him
[1:28:06] just time ran out for his body
[1:28:10] and the same expectation for the rapture
[1:28:13] he went into the ground with
[1:28:15] that's what he'll come up with
[1:28:17] [Applause]
[1:28:26] those people are the great clown
[1:28:29] witnesses
[1:28:32] and let us lay aside every weight

[1:31:32] in this in this area and he was a kind
[1:31:35] of a guy that
[1:31:36] he would go to a meeting and if and if a
[1:31:39] fight broke out
[1:31:41] and people were protesting in the

[1:36:11] but were eyewitnesses of his majesty
[1:36:14] for he received from god the father
[1:36:16] honor and glory
[1:36:17] when there were came such a voice to him
[1:36:20] from the absolute glory
[1:36:22] this is my beloved son in whom we are
[1:36:26] well pleased
[1:36:28] he could say it boldly because he was
[1:36:31] standing there
[1:36:41] i always like a real personal witness oh
[1:36:44] yeah
[1:36:47] there's nothing better for a court trial
[1:36:49] than an
[1:36:50] eyewitness amen that'll tell the truth
[1:36:54] hard to find but but
[1:36:57] an eyewitness will tell the truth peter
[1:37:00] james and john were eyewitnesses
[1:37:06] to tell the truth and it was more than
[1:37:10] just a supernatural event
[1:37:13] they was watching the deity of god
[1:37:16] this is more than a prophet he's more
[1:37:20] than a man
[1:37:22] this is the messiah now listen
[1:37:26] it was so anchored until these men would
[1:37:29] have to give their life for it
[1:37:32] notice the next words we have a more
[1:37:34] sure word of prophecy
[1:37:38] this is just not fables and this is not
[1:37:40] just something that's put together
[1:37:43] this message is more than the mind of a
[1:37:46] man
[1:37:50] this is just not fables put together
[1:37:53] right amen
[1:37:54] this is just not a church to where you
[1:37:56] come and you're sitting
[1:37:57] you just listen poetry or just some
[1:38:00] pretty scriptures that are put together
[1:38:03] god's not a mission
[1:38:07] are you with me he's transforming a
[1:38:10] group of people
[1:38:12] because god cannot rapture
[1:38:15] tape recorders
[1:38:18] he cannot rapture your equipment of
[1:38:20] devices that you listen to
[1:38:23] what his intention to do is not
[1:38:26] not rapture this but to rapture
[1:38:30] this living in human claims
[1:38:32] [Applause]
[1:38:35] are you with me brother shannon what
[1:38:38] changed you
[1:38:41] he changed you didn't happen at the same
[1:38:44] time
[1:38:46] maybe he didn't even understand it and
[1:38:48] it was supernatural
[1:38:49] now it's hard to explain how it happened
[1:38:52] amen
[1:38:54] but you will stand peter said i was an
[1:38:57] eyewitness
[1:39:00] i was an eyewitness now what happened

[1:52:45] mortals and yet believe
[1:52:47] these are angels talking to god and
[1:52:49] reminding him of his promise
[1:52:51] toward his children and god listens to
[1:52:54] these angels
[1:52:55] amen they've never seen but they
[1:52:58] know that moses said that the lord your
[1:53:01] god will raise up a prophet like unto me
[1:53:03] they knew what he was coming and by
[1:53:06] faith they looked forward to the coming
[1:53:08] of the son of god
[1:53:10] let's hear them testify saying then i
[1:53:13] look back and
[1:53:14] and there and i see i see wormwood

[1:53:21] told you to do but
[1:53:24] i can't let you go for this
[1:53:27] is a man's size job

[1:53:38] you to do something that i'm going to do
[1:53:40] myself
[1:53:41] [Music]
[1:53:43] and i can hear him reach over there and
[1:53:45] say come here east wind and west wind
[1:53:48] and north and south
[1:53:49] and and everything's in the solar system
[1:53:52] it's in my command
[1:53:54] and they obey him and turns at his
[1:53:57] command
[1:53:58] but i but the heart of man thinks
[1:54:02] they know more than god does
[1:54:05] amen and he can't touch the stony heart
[1:54:09] of a man
[1:54:10] how i think this morning he could say
[1:54:13] let winter change to summer
[1:54:16] and summer to winter and it obey him
[1:54:19] like that
[1:54:20] he could say mars you go over here in
[1:54:23] jupiter you go over there it would obey
[1:54:25] him
[1:54:27] he could speak it there he stands in his
[1:54:30] majesty
[1:54:32] and when man fails to recognize him
[1:54:36] when he stood yonder who why
[1:54:39] who what is that man is mindful
[1:54:43] of him when he stood there in this space
[1:54:47] when there was nothing else before there
[1:54:50] was even a star
[1:54:52] in the heavens before there was a sun in
[1:54:55] the heavens
[1:54:56] he blowed him off of his hand
[1:55:03] and he created a son
[1:55:07] the god that did that said today i'm
[1:55:10] going down and i'm going to get in a
[1:55:12] fire
[1:55:14] ain't no god that's in a yeah
[1:55:17] i'm fire here because he met me in a
[1:55:19] fire
[1:55:21] and it came to a point to where they
[1:55:23] would say where you were that brother
[1:55:25] nathanael
[1:55:26] they were making decisions they're good
[1:55:28] doctors
[1:55:29] they're doing their best even i'll see
[1:55:31] them tomorrow they're doing their best
[1:55:32] to preserve my life
[1:55:34] but i believe another report
[1:55:37] [Applause]
[1:55:39] they said in a few hours we'll harvest
[1:55:41] these organs
[1:55:42] i needed them to preach to you this
[1:55:44] morning
[1:55:51] [Applause]
[1:56:01] i'm not going to get finished i haven't
[1:56:02] hardly touched my notes but
[1:56:06] i'll just save it till next week that
[1:56:08] would be okay
[1:56:09] [Applause]
[1:56:11] just think about that god that said come
[1:56:13] here east wind
[1:56:15] west north and south i may have that
[1:56:18] backwards all the way standing on this
[1:56:20] compass now but
[1:56:22] he called for the the cloud
[1:56:26] to ride on brother brown said he'd get
[1:56:29] on a zigzag
[1:56:30] lightning amen he used those words
[1:56:33] zigzag
[1:56:34] you know look that up look up zig zach
[1:56:37] this isn't science just zigzag
[1:56:41] and in a moment god of the heavens
[1:56:44] was standing in a fire
[1:56:47] i thought of that this morning as i
[1:56:49] walked into my office and i felt his
[1:56:51] presence
[1:56:53] and i begin to consciously aware brother
[1:56:55] nathanael
[1:56:57] that he's been here waiting on me
[1:57:01] i thought about those three hebrew
[1:57:03] children as i'm coming to the end
[1:57:07] he was standing in the fire waiting on
[1:57:11] them to come
[1:57:15] andrew as you so phenomenally spoke last
[1:57:18] night
[1:57:20] lazarus they were pushing against
[1:57:24] they were pushing against a stone
[1:57:27] and there's no way that they could
[1:57:29] comprehend
[1:57:30] i'll be fixing this dinner in just a
[1:57:33] couple of hours
[1:57:41] i love it i absolutely love it
[1:57:48] i just told this young lad my son before
[1:57:51] i walked out
[1:57:53] i said he was looking at the monitor and
[1:57:56] it was showing all of you as you were
[1:57:58] worshiping
[1:58:00] and i said it's hard to comprehend but
[1:58:03] all of those people are getting ready to
[1:58:05] turn young
[1:58:06] [Applause]
[1:58:15] [Music]
[1:58:22] brother bill it may not look it but me
[1:58:24] and you are the same age
[1:58:26] amen it may not feel it but we're the
[1:58:30] same age
[1:58:32] this outer shell might be showing a
[1:58:33] different thing but
[1:58:36] in god's thoughts
[1:58:40] in god's thoughts just as much as he was
[1:58:42] standing there
[1:58:45] what we're experiencing now is a revival
[1:58:48] that's preparing to change your body
[1:58:51] thank you lord
[1:58:54] here's where i want to come to now i
[1:58:56] want to come
[1:58:58] thomas says it means something to you
[1:59:01] the revival that's going on now
[1:59:04] is what me and your daddy talked about
[1:59:06] in that back office
[1:59:16] we couldn't make it happen it had to
[1:59:20] wait on its season
[1:59:22] but we knew it was coming our prophet
[1:59:25] told us it was coming
[1:59:33] oh you may be looking to see great
[1:59:35] things this is that happening
[1:59:37] but what you don't realize what god's
[1:59:39] doing in these services
[1:59:42] is taking you one step at another
[1:59:45] changing your body
[1:59:49] and when you can't see him he's moving
[1:59:53] when you can't feel him he's moving
[2:00:01] he's doing work
[2:00:03] [Applause]

[2:00:14] what are your expectations brother ron
[2:00:17] and i'm sorry
