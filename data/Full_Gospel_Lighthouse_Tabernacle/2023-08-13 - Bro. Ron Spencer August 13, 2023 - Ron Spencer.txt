Lord isn't it yeah man I was kind of absorbed standing there I wasn't paying much attention to Matthew but I was thinking about what these girls just sing and he thought how how incredible that linked with last night Matthew introducing that new song last night and I certainly enjoyed that Matthew and amen what a wonderful job that guy did last night yeah I want to tell you for every young man and ever young girl and every one of us in the building need to go back and listen to that again I wish I'd heard that when I was at my high school years it would have saved me a lot of trouble a whole lot of trouble and uh man that was just so good it was just so good amen a lot of compliments coming on it brother Andrew did an awesome job in Ohio last night I don't know if you've got to see that yet but there the prayer line went so after 12 o'clock last night and they probably prayed for about a thousand people and we spoke on Friday night and had an incredible time and it's been an incredible meeting and so it's made me a little bit tired I left the meeting brother Alden advised me to just stay up there and rest but uh [Music] I just kind of felt led I needed to speak what I'm speaking this morning so here we are and so but that don't mean that mother nature don't take over and I'm wore out but but what an incredible meeting that is going on there and just pray for brother Timothy as he preaches this morning and God's doing great things around the world and so we're just thankful for these meetings we're getting ready to have one in a few days and I'm looking forward to to what God has in store for us and so amen I give my all when I go to a meeting because I feel like God will pay it back and we have these men of God in God will pay us back for the work that we have done and so looking forward to all the people that will come in for that and amen so good to see you Dave sure I prayed for you this week and amen but Dave got a real touch last weekend and he actually sent me a text afterward and thanked me and then then he lost his brother this week and those things are difficult and amen I thought of how good God is gave you a touch on Sunday knowing what she was getting ready to go through and so we just thank God for that but the Mark is so good to see you Amen in North Carolina he got a special touch there and so amen amen so good to see each and every one of you once you turn to your neighbor say good to be in the house of the Lord with you and [Music] God bless you we love you with all of our hearts and sister Phyllis I hope your house hope you're enjoying that new place and so amen now you won't get to enjoy it long we're getting ready to go up to a new home and so we'll enjoy that one whether I live in a tent or in a mansion it'll be okay and so if you will turn with me in your scriptures this morning to Genesis chapter 24. am I good to be here isn't it we certainly love him with all of our hearts and Genesis chapter 24 and verse 12. this is the text that brother Branham spoke of choosing of a bride and he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham I pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master Abraham behold I stand Here by The Well of water and the daughters of the men of the City come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy camel's drink also and let the same be that she that that has appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou has showed kindness unto my master it's quite a statement right here and I want to I want to spend a little time with that let's pray Lord Jesus we love you today we're so thankful for what you're doing we realize that we're standing right at the edge of the into the end of the Gentile dispensation father all things are ready the bride is prepared to go home not just in little small regions but around the world and Lord we ask you now that you would speak to our hearts and anoint us wash us and we shall be clean touch our hearts today there's many needs father and I ask you that you'd stretch forth your hand right now Lord sister Peril is at a very dark hour we ask you that you would be with her brother Bill Hinkle Lord Brother Roger the many others Lord Jesus that have great needs we asked you to send your word and touch them today Father thank God that there's a land beyond the river Lord we ask you for traveling safety for our children that are becoming home from Ohio not just our children but Lord there's just people from all over the states and even overseas that's at that meeting I ask you that you would watch over them and anoint brother Timothy as he stands even now in the Pulpit to speak and I know he's tired and he's weary I understand that but I pray that you had anoint his mind Lord help us today thank you for brother Matthew and brother Andrew and brother Williams speaking over the last couple of weeks and Lord how you blessed our hearts and now we ask you that you as we turn our hearts toward the word anoint your servant not just your servant but anoint your children to hear in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen and amen you can be seated it's incredibly important where brother Branham took his text from and choosing of a bride he had been sent to call out a bride for Jesus Christ the Full Gospel businessman was a place to where that the denominations didn't feel so intimidated they didn't want to have him in their churches but some of them would come out to where he was at and and even then there would be be men that would boycott the meetings and tell their people not to go I just want to share this story with you brother Kelly hildebranch church was one of the places to where that you know their their founding pastor would would begin to believe the message and and the local pastors would tell him that you know don't go to that that meeting in Saskatoon we need to stay away from that cult and stay away from that Ministry and they would tell their people don't you go it was a huge Hall that was rented for brother Branham to preach in and it would seat thousands and there was only about 300. but what brother Gunther found that all of those men that told their people to boycott all those men were sitting on the front rows so they're told they're people not to go but they went themselves and brother Gunther began to listen to the message and he found out that it was something that that he could believe and it was something that was actually open in the scriptures for him and so from that became a a church there that's the way the message was spread all around the world you know what others didn't want to hear there was a bride that was interested in listening to the message of the hour brother Branham standing and choosing of a bride and he would begin to he would begin to talk about you know that that that that elohiser was being sent then he began to describe that you have a choice and you have a choice for your education you have a choice of where you want to live you have a choice for your church and the ministry you have a choice you have a choice God Don't Force nothing on you you have a choice but that predestinated sea we'll hear the message of the hour as he begins to go through the message and no I'm not going to repreach it but as it begins to go through the message he begins to describe that God's looking for a wife a wife that has character a wife that can be Washed by the Water of the word and she will not be she will not be a woman that will be manhandled by denomination she will come out from among those groups and hear the word of the hour that doesn't mean that they're they're going to hell but God's going to have a wife he's going to have a wife that will reflect him that will reflect his character now now let me just say we were married to our first Union our first nature and no doubt in in some of that and some of you were Tangled in denominational ideas had all different kinds of thinking you know even in our first nature we we had to have that to die that first nature that we were married to that thing had to die inside of us to have Christ to live on the inside of us the first nature had to die new husband had to come and come to the king room of our heart and the word began to wash us now if you're a predestinated seed it doesn't offend you whatsoever it just doesn't offend you now there might make things that you look at it a little clock at it for a little while but after a bit it begins to wash you and clean you up and the spirit of God comes on the inside of you and you grab a hold of the word and you begin to say that's nothing but the truth How will I know brother Ron you will identify yourself with the word now now when we're talking about a bride that's Universal and no doubt in in man's thinking well we must have a headquarters well we do it's the Holy Ghost well we must have great schools of teaching well we do God is raised up men that have laid aside denominational thinking and then Washed by the message of the hour we've we've had young ministers here and I will continue to have young ministers here that have been raised up in the message and the and it just to me proves that this message is alive and well the other day we we had brother Nathan here and as he stood there he didn't go to some theology school and spend years there but he's been washed by the word here stood in Matthew last night there stood William last weekend there stands Andrew every weekend here for us and and you hear the word and you think well you know they must have went to a school and I and the reason I'm saying that let me just say this to you if you stop and listen to some of these even these television evangelist here's voice here's boys that can outpreach them guys a million to one [Applause] and not only has It produced a Ministry it's produced to people and people ask how do you produce a people like that the spoken word of God [Applause] Hallelujah now now remember remember the sin that had to drop off your life God had to cleanse us of all of those things he begins to wash us and forgive us of our sins we begin to move forward and just like in the Book of Ruth and we've been we've been dealing with it for a few weeks in the Book of Ruth if you will notice something and I and I and I'm going to borrow this from Nathan brother Nathan Erickson he he said you know in Ruth he said there's no remembrance of what she used to be and that's what we've been preaching no doubt Boaz would not let anybody talk about where she came from or her former or her former life but Boaz is the hero of the book he is the Redeemer that brings her in and elevates her from almost like an orphan lady with an incredible history but he elevates her to be Queen and the seed that she that's produced through her womb brings her into the body of Christ but notice when God allows them to write the book he doesn't call it Boaz he calls it Ruth I love that don't you so we're no longer under our old nature or we're no longer chasing the kings of this world but we're Washed by the influence of the mighty angel and let me just say this you brother Ron do we still have you know I still have trouble I still have situations in my life you'll always have that you'll always have that you're always going to have some of those things in your life because listen your flesh is not born again and even on the day of the Rapture you're going to face some difficult situations because Satan knows that he is coming to the end of fighting you and you're his torment his worst enemy you're here you're his nightmare he has did everything that he can to attract you and pull you out of this are you with me now but you're married to another king are you with me but the gene seed of God is eternal and there's a major difference between the gene seed of God and your fight in this natural realm you'll always have difficulties how can we walk out of a service brother Timothy and it feels like the Rapture is getting ready to happen and then on Monday morning Brother David how can you walk out of service in incredibly enjoy the service like this and then in a week because we're still living in this realm [Applause] now watch this but there will be a spot and I want to drive this there will be a stop spot to where we'll never again be touched by the hands of the enemy Oh Glory now watch this a drop of ink now that ink was made for a purpose that color that color was for a purpose that one drop of ink can either sign your death warrant and send you to an electric chair or that drop of ink can pardon you of your sins and it was set in there it was sitting there for a purpose we've got to use it for the right thing are you with me Matthew finished with this and I thought it was incredible in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 life submit yourself to your own until your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be subject unto their own husbands and everything now that don't make you an abuser man are you with me listen and sisters you don't have to live in an abusive home husbands love your wife even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it by the washing by the word so what men to love their wives as their own bodies are you with me turned my head and I lost my place so that he might sanctify and cleanse it by the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself as a glorious Church I love this statement not having spot or wrinkle or any such blemish but it should be holy and without a blemish are you with me now what a statement I want you to read this with me that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that it might should be holy and without blemish brother Ron does that mean we're going to have thoughts in this life you'll always have thoughts does that mean we're going to have difficulty with our nature we'll always have difficulty with our nature but God has provided a blood he has provided a message that when God looks at you not how you look at you or even at one another but when God looks at you you're a glorious Church and not have a spot or wreak or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish sought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherish it even as the Lord the church for we are members of this body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they shall be one flesh notice these next words this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church Proverbs chapter 31 and verse 10 if you'll put that up for me I don't know about you but I read out of Proverbs most every day you'll find it in my devotions to read out of Proverbs most every day but all through the Book of Proverbs it talks about difficult difficult situations of women it'll talk about the adulterous women it'll talk about bossy brawling women better to dwell on the rooftop you get it but if the closing chapter he writes about who can find a virtuous woman now notice Solomon is writing and God is igniting him to write I'm looking for a bride because that's God's crowning achievement that's the reason this message came I'm looking for a bride that can be without spotter blemish I'm not looking for a bride that will be like the other books of of proverbs but I'm looking for a bride that who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies which is concerned considered true rubies greater than diamonds the heart of her husband that safely trust in her God's saying these words my heart is trusting you so that that he shall have no need of spool of spoil now just think about it our past history is put away our past thoughts our past actions are put away in the mind of God when we talk about the Sea of God's forgetfulness and we talk about what God throws our sins then many would say God puts up a sign and says no fishing but it is Satan that comes and digs up the bones and wants to take those The Old Man and bring it back up again I'm not talking to the right Church but we're not Catholics here we're not Catholics here we don't beat ourselves for what we used to be we don't believe in a Purgatory are you with me now we don't beat ourselves over the back the blood of Jesus Christ that cause us the Bride of Jesus Christ has washed us are you with me now washed us now listen those things will always lay in your memory they'll always lay in your memory but remember that's not the Eternal part of you your flesh Satan has an access to your spirit affections memory all the emotions that you go through all of those things Satan can get to that yeah he can get to that and bring up things that you ain't thought about for 40 years and he'll bring that up and it's then your responsibility to say hey there's a blood that's took care of that I'm not that man anymore now I actually got the note here here I had an old friend he was a friend in the world and Matthew was so beautiful but he was a friend in the world and he and I got into a lot of trouble together and in any way we were together probably especially in my teenage years and then up into my early 20s and so we we we did a lot of stuff stuff that I don't want to go over I'm not I'm not wanting to mention this morning and so when the boys we were actually buying Andrew a Mustang and Connie still wants one but but anyway uh we make a truck out of it we'll be doing really good but anyway uh he wanted to come and see me and he was constantly after me brother Donnie wanted to come see me we'd call me about every week and we would talk and you know and you know I talked to him about the word talk to him about Christ and so one day I said yeah yeah come see me and so he drove about two and a half hours here and you know I I told him I said I'll meet you at McDonald's because it's just right below where we're buying a car at so you know we went in and we sat down we had a sandwich and we were sitting there talking and and and and he had long curly hair and you know and you you begin to talk and he was one of those guys that had a place between his teeth you know and didn't need a toothpick there and and so anyway you know we we had experienced a lot of things together and so I I thought well if he's drove two and a half hours he he wants to talk to me about some things so he began to talk and you know the boys were sitting there and they were they were listening to him and I instructed let's just listen to what he's got to say and they were listening to him and he took me through Tin Can Alley what we used to doing what we used to do and what we used to doing you know he'd sit there and laugh at those things and you know I just I just remember all of that you know I I let him go for about a half an hour and I said well Eddie I need to tell you something the man you're talking about these boys don't know these boys don't know that man you see the man that you knew he died and I'm giving you a lesson here the man that you knew the man that you knew brother Marcus that Man's dead he's dead he's dead now this looks like the same house it's got a little bit more gray hair it's not built like it used to be but it's the same house but there's a new king there's a new man that lives on the inside of here are you with me now what God gives you the Holy Ghost for is to bring this man into check [Music] now how many is in here just ever rode horses oh yeah yeah I was raised with horses we we the first Vision that I ever had was about a horse and I saw getting a brown horse that was a pinto horse and it was a tall horse and I saw it I was sitting on a rock and and I saw us getting this horse I told my dad that and he said well we'll look around a little bit well a few years later he bought me a pony that wasn't a vision a few years later that horse was three years old and we went to an altizer Farm who raised horses and uh I said dad right there it's the horse so Dad told the man the vision and he was asking pretty incredible amount of money for it and he said if that boy had a vision that he was going to have that horse he said I'm just gonna I'm just gonna give you this horse for it was almost a giveaway and that horse I rode that horse for years now that horse was a spirited animal it was a spirited animal he had his own nature and he and he stood he stood quite tall he'd still be over my head now which don't have to be real tall but you know when you got on him he would do a whirl and and doing a whirl you you had to be ready when you're when your buttocks hit the saddle you better be ready to take control and so because he was quick in his feet we made a cutting horse out of him and he was quick in his feet and and he could run like the wind and I just loved it when I was alone and I just put my head right down in his Mane and he would just you know because he would get low and he would run but there was times that he wanted to go to the barn because he was done I wasn't done but he was done but you see I was the controller and I had a bit in his mouth and I and I had rains in my hand I love that animal and if you was in my office now there's about 40 horses in my office remingtons but anyway anyway these I would I would take him and even as a boy and let me just say I wasn't a very Stout boy but I graduated weighing 133 pounds and so I was just a skinny guy but anyway I'd grab those reins and I would turn him are you catching it now I would turn him and then making a cutting horse out of him I could turn him and he could stand on the his back feet and turn his body we even had pictures of him standing on one foot turning in a circle he didn't learn to do that on his own we have to train him to do that now if you can do a horse like that don't tell me that the Holy Ghost can't control your nature are you with me now God renews your mind he renews it to where you speak like God he renews it to where you think like God are you with me but remember that old nature are you with me now that old nature will want you to read old things or he'll fill your mind with all different kind of all different kind of things and if you feed on that it'll make you weak in the Holy Spirit but if you feed on the word are you with me you feed on the word and the word is on the inside of you and that word washes you you'll be able to control This Old Man and this old spirit here's a scripture that set me free because Satan tries to dig up what you used to be and he tests your faith in the blood of Jesus Christ every person in this building has a history could you all raise your hand and attest to that now do you see well brother Ron I never went out in sin I'm too young to go out and sin but you were born in your first nature you were born in your first nature and it wants to have rain of your life and so like you heard last night having friends of the world listen your nature want to pull you that way but you got to grab it by the rain because we're headed in two different directions the scripture says in Romans chapter 8 and verse 1 there is therefore now and if you remember this is right after Romans chapter 7 to where we're divorced of our first nature and that first nature dies and even Paul writes woe is me I'm unclean woe is me notice now but there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus notice these words hath made me free from the law of sin and death we've said it before when Esther Was preparing to go before the king she asked the main attendant the servant of the king what does he like because notice all of the other girls and there were many of them were offered everything in the Kingdom to put on every kind of every kind of jewelry every kind of wash every kind of thing you notice this servant had been the servant to vashti and bashtai had been put away are you with me she had been the queen but at vashtai this servant had attended to Heron but there came a times where she didn't want the word she didn't want the kink she wanted to make her own choice and the King had to put her away so now he's going to select a wife out of all of these girls but she had a proper because of Mordecai's teaching find out what the king likes you remember there was a song that was written elohiser tell me more what does he look like what does he like what does he really like I preached a sermon in the old church on on Summit Avenue and and you can tell your mom I mentioned this and it was a sermon that talked about elohiser taught Rebecca what Isaac was like what he liked we needed a prophet in this day to wash us from denominational ideas and wash them for from all of that theology because we were married to a system a man-made system and as I preached that and I preached what does he like and how does he want us to dress it Christine came to me after that service and said I want to give my heart to the Lord and believe this message with all my heart I've never told that but that's quite a statement isn't it Esther asked the servant what does he want what is he like and in her purification she brought herself under submission to the king's desires all of those others walk before the king but it didn't reflect the character that he was looking for how can he turn us down how can he turn us down we've been watched by the work not just this church around the world around the world we've we've heard the word of God I think our brother George Quinn a small congregation but he's preached this message with all its heart it don't matter what the world says but he could present a group to the to the to the Rapture and prepare them for Rapture prepare them for a body change because a message got him ready are you with me now foreign I'm sorry when that King stepped out of that morning and he saw Esther he saw himself no I wanna I want you to think about this the king's choice it's either right or wrong and if you're the one before Esther and he just nods his head no it's over it's over you just become another girl in the society and then that girl watches Esther Step Up and immediately he responds that's her because she reflects the character that he's looking for the girls after him no doubt he's looked down in the aisle and now they just go back to being ladies that but Esther caught his eye are you with me or are you are you seeing where I'm at now I want to share this with you now we we've shared it we've shared it so many times but I want to share this with you this morning brother Brown I'm talking about his vision of the Bride kind of sums a lot of things up he said when this bride she was looking right the one that was talking to me I was standing there her eyes she was the cleanest sweetest looking people I ever seen in my life look like it could have been a dozen or more I don't know how many abreast but there was just a group of them and she passed by a sweet with air her eyes watching as she passed by she was beautiful and I looked at her as she passed by and I said and he said now we shall review that's the bride now we will review the churches and they come and I noticed them coming up and when they came up each one of them looked like they got worse I never seen such a filthy bunch in my life and when he said next I heard a voice and it said next and here comes the American group and I and and I am I'm an American but I I say this that made me sick I'm not eloquent enough to in a mixed audience to say what I was taking place but you'll have to read between the lines but when the women were coming the leader of them was a witch and she had a great long nose and a big mouth and all of them was dressed in some kind of a lower close down there but just the top was like a strap and just a little about a half inch strap moved right around them like this what vulgarity the prophet was seeing and when they passed by the review and stand in the back of them you could see thus they were going up in their foremost their back part and they were just acting and I said is this a church and there she went they were singing and twisting Rock and rolls you know and ever what you call going down singing and going by and said I said is that the church and I was standing there in my heart I was crying and this switch to my notion is nothing else in the world but she's that World Council of churches leaving them straight down the road where she was going and they went off to the left and disappeared into chaos still beating this music making making funny sounds shaping their bodies one side then another side like that and carrying on walking I started to bow my head and said and and he said wait the bride must come again and I looked here they come and they passed by a sweet looking little ladies and they was all going right at me and as they passed by I noticed each one of them dressed different and one in the back kind of long hair hanging down and rolled around like this she might have been German or something like that and I watched them and coming before were he was standing he he was holding a little paper in front and that's goes back to the other part I I want you to just notice just for a moment brother Branham had the opportunity to watch the church in its condition but think about 1965 where the church was think about where she was think about where she is now every year they begin to tilt off a little further off of the cliff every year Sodom has an effect on her every year the dress begins to change a little bit more every year she begins to take on new things of the world the reason is she turned the message down are you with me she had a chance at the word but she turned it down not just in this day but look what happened in Luther's age the Revival went forth men got a hold of it and denominated listen to Lutheran Churches nowhere near what it was when Luther was here when John Wesley was here it was a mighty move of God and a lot of Ministries went out for it powerful but it denominated it denominated and died and every year she begins to Eclipse into a different Realm Pentecost today I'm not talking about it I'm not talking about Acts 2 Pentecost but Azusa Pentecost she's a far cry she's a far cry from where she was listen when brother Branham was preaching to him he said every year I come back I see more Bobcat women if he could see it today if you could see their dress today listen don't let don't think I'm being hard here I'm just calling it how it is but if you could see the church today where she's at I I've got a reason to preach like this if he could see where she's at five wise and five foolish but notice the bride came back into review again and what he preached what he delivered about 1200 love letters is in physical frame now it's sitting in flesh saying amen amen amen amen amen amen listen this message isn't for everybody you know we're not going to force the message on you whatsoever but this message is for the Bride of Jesus Christ and God must have a wife in this generation and she's here the bride's Revival is wrong and the focus of why I'm preaching this God has a bride here that can take a rapture I want to say this to you we're here what's going on in the denominal world has no effect on us they made their choices does that mean they're going to hell no Every Man Has to stand in the judgment and God's going to give Grace thank God for God to give Grace to good people I got great friends there but they've been deceived by a system by programs by Creeds and dogmas you're watching by the way of Internet pay close attention just now the layout I see an age was found themselves they found that they didn't have a need of nothing but they were naked and blind and miserable and poor a church filled with money a church is filled with gold church is filled with people but I read an article just yesterday that said we can't hold our people anymore we can't hold that's why churches are are shutting down we don't have an issue the Bride of Jesus Christ doesn't have that issue she's growing not just in numbers but she's growing in character are you with me now and the longer this thing goes the more pure you look the less like Sodom you look like are you with me but I asked who is going to be responsible for leading those people into the tribulation period brother Brown said there's disappointments at the judgment he said now that drunk won't be disappointed he knows what he did he said that prostitute won't be disappointed she knows what she did but the people that will be disappointed will be people that said in churches and their Pastor deceived them telling them they're all right now now let me just go back here just for a moment because a story always solidifies things and helps you to see it brother random had a girl in his church that refused to come under the word she she just didn't want it but I want you to notice now and she goes to another church she leaves her husband she goes to another church you know you know and by the the nominal system she's you know she's all of that and and yet she she goes to a church and she becomes a musician she becomes a Sunday school teacher but that didn't cleanse her this is a real story and she leaves that husband goes to another church same thing happens and she and brother bam uses the term Jim and John said she marries another man then she marries another man listen she had religion and it was covering her and religion didn't clean her up but when it came or time to die she dies a young woman and she called for who brother Branham and said her pastor was standing there consoling her that everything would be all right but she was telling him you've deceived me and she wants brother Branham to come but he doesn't get there soon enough brother Branham uses a term he said she had grieved her soul away but when it came time to die her soul came back listen I don't want that to be my testimony I don't want that to be my testimony at the end of the road I've turned the word down and lived any kind of life but I knowed what was true listen you you can't deceive your heart but so much your heart knows what's true you know what's the truth young people's sin is pleasurable for a season but you know what's the truth I wish I could just I wish I could just drive this point you know what's the truth and in my wildest ugliest days I knew what was the truth and the worst fight that I ever got in was when a man in a bar room called William Branham a false prophet it was not pretty it was not pretty and I'm listen I'm halfway ashamed of that but thank God even in that condition I stood up for this message are you with me listen you can hear this word this word will never leave you this word will never leave you but let me just say if you do the right thing every day you may have to tell some of your friends I can't do that I can't do that they may make fun of you that's okay that's okay all those other girls go out in the world but you get chosen by the Queen the king of Heaven it's okay to get turned down here it's okay to be made fun of him it's okay for people to put shame on you here but we ought to call that royalty gold it's good for us it's actually a compliment to us [Applause] brother Brandon tells a story and I think it's so incredible that he picks up a story and tells it about an armor and Company son going to look at a ranch house they actually owned the place but he's going there he's looking for a wife he said he couldn't find none in Chicago now listen he's rich armor company goes a long way back and they're wealthy I was in the I was a meat cutter for seven years and God rich in Mercy I didn't have to be a meat cutter forever but evidently I am now but anyway he couldn't find a wife with all the money and all the prestige you couldn't find a wife in Chicago so he goes he goes into and the foreman has all of his daughters to prepare a party you know and they dance and you know they dress up just like all the girls in Chicago you know he stayed inside for a while but after a bit he walks outside and he's standing at the Corral and there was a girl that was throwing out dishwater and he saw her and he begins to talk to her and as he begins to talk to her he finds character of what he's looking for and as he's talking to her he realizes this is the one it wasn't in there this is the one the man said there she stood in no shoes barefooted she didn't have a frilly dress on had a dish pan in her hand and she was an orphaned girl and this man makes her a promise and he tells her why I have came to find character I find character in you I find character in you and at the end at the end they don't chase her around the church Thomas or Homer but he reaches over and kisses her on the cheek and he seals his conversation with a kiss that'll give us a license to do that but he seals it with a kiss that she knows he means business that's why God gives you the Holy Ghost because he knows you can't do it on your own so he comes and lives on the inside of you and seals himself inside of you and it will produce the character of Jesus Christ in you and it'll be like a fountain Floyd because you can't wash yourself you can't clean yourself up you can't move past the old chapters of your book you knew what Ruth was like you knew what Esther was like you knew what all those was like you know what yourself was like but if the blood of Jesus Christ Crystal it's the blood of Jesus Christ is truly applied you're not that person no more [Applause] now she goes and tells the story incredible story they make fun of her for a year she tells this story for a year she's making a wedding dress for a year she's preparing because he made a promise brother Branham would say later in another place he said he watched you for that year listen he's watching us now he's watching us now he's seeing this bride he's Among Us the mighty Angel is Among Us accompanied in US what do you feel when you come into this building you don't feel that at Walmart you don't feel that at your favorite restaurant you feel his presence when you come when you get up in the morning you begin to pray and that warm passage comes in he's watching you now he's saying that this he's going to finish this [Music] I want to drive this they made fun of her and the last day I want you to think about this some of the things that you're doing right now you're doing them for the last time can I drill this just for a minute she made their breakfast last time she cleaned their table last time she washed her clothes last time are you with me I'm not too far off and this story's not too far off Ruth picked the pick those those that up the last times she wouldn't always do it she was going to be a queen Esther wouldn't always be out there among the women she was getting ready to be the queen We're Not Gonna always be here all right this church will be filled with cobwebs one of these days it'll be a place that just people will go by and said something happened to those people I'm going to tell you what the something happened was the promise that he made us and he sealed it with a kiss he confirmed his promise he changed their bodies we heard a message that prepared us for the rapture that message indicted this denominational generation it indicted these preachers it told us Souls now in prison it says why I'm not a denomination why I'm not tossed about this message called us out and what they didn't want we said yes [Music] [Applause] yes I believe it yes in the Philippines yes in South Africa yes in China yes all over the world [Applause] the Holy Ghost brought a bride out and she stands a bride adorned for her husband that woman walks out the girl walks out with her wedding dress on and brother Brandon said that's when the persecution set in when it's now more than a story more than a testimony but when she's dressed when she's dressed all them cousins really start making fun you know who I feel for and I'm gonna drop this you know who I feel for the most it's not the Baptist or the Methodist the Presbyterian or Pentecostals it's for people that have set in in cues and fault preachers while he preached sent negative vibes tried to brush the message off and then they watch their loved ones get a body change foreign I'm going to say that again I don't feel sorry for the Baptist the Methodist the Presbyterian Pentecostals they're headed for the tribulation period and let me just explain to you in a one sentence of the prophet he said the tribulation period And he says incredible thing here you that's watching them by the way of the internet let God deal with your heart right now make a move make a move leave your homes get ready get ready we don't have much longer get ready well brother Ron I've been toying with the message don't toy with it don't toy with it this message is accomplished in what it said it would do these people didn't move four hours here leave their jobs leave their homes listen it was difficult what they had to do but this message was more important how many hours did you move this guy moved 13 hours because he was down praying and God told them to move here listen they left family they left their home they left their job this works more important [Applause] this word's more important than anything this world's got listen you people that live 15 minutes away listen you need to appreciate you need to appreciate are you with me now there's people in all different kind of places that don't have a pastor that listens to this word every weekend not just ours but other brother Donnie brother Tim listens to the word of the hour because this message is more important than anything in the world was I proud yesterday I drove nine and a half hours I actually drove six and a half Connie drove three hours yesterday I was totally Zapped he said are you going to church last weekend I was too tired I was too tired but I listened to everything you said and I got pages of notes from your sermon just because I'm home I didn't lay there and goof off this message is too important to miss you you miss a service go listen to it go listen to it get what God's saying to us and as I sat there as War as I was one son's in Ohio pouring his heart out and the other son is standing here and I thought about this is what this message has produced make sure your children understand this is the most important part of the week listen this is living proof don't get quiet now you ought to say amen and thank God for it your sons may not be preachers but I watched Isaac I watched your daughter they said second third row in Ohio they said on the edge of their seat you ought to be proud really proud this is the most important thing we do everybody can make fun until you hear the horses coming everybody can make fun until the rain starts falling everybody can make fun until we get a body change everybody can make fun until bombs start dropping it is thin everybody will believe this message was right God did send the prophet God did prepare us God didn't get us ready [Applause] their laughter stopped and he stopped at the fence at the gate and took her and said I've been watching you all year long and you believe me and you got yourself ready here's why I wanted you here Marcus it doesn't matter the difficulty of 20 years that book is over I want that to be sounding everywhere I told Marcus a story about being on a plane for 20 years looking for that man and then God maybe somebody hasn't seen this but Marcus will you stand can you get a picture of him I was on an airplane over 20 years ago thank you and I'm just going to tell a very short version he said my life is a mess my life is a complete mess but I was raised in the message I was raised in a message I'm gonna tell this for a reason I was raised in the message and he told me told me about the squirrels you're talking about had it right he told me enough to know that I was raised I'm not fooling but my life is a mess we get off of the plane and I want to spend some time with him here 20 years later and I've told that in conventions looking for that seed but I'm not the one that is supposed to find it I was just looking for the end of the story are you with me God don't forget God don't forget and here we are 20 some years later and we're sitting down here with the family you're sitting there watching it as it took place and God speaks in my ear the man on the airplane the man on the airplane is sitting beside of you now listen let me just say this to you God puts you in some pretty difficult spots Friday night he put me in a spot I'm getting ready to make an illustration and I call a boy sitting on this side of the building and I call him he's a curly-headed boy good-looking guy he's a curly-headed boy and he steps up on the stage and I'm going to call him for an illustration one in a million and I'm calling him for an illustration and when he gets me or God's got another plan I can't make myself do this I can't be wrong and God tells him his story standing right there in front of him and he starts screaming that's the truth that's the truth that's the truth and it begins to scream and I notice now we're in a moment me and this boy is in a moment his family hates the message but he's standing there for a reason he's Kim to Wayne Lawson and their family he's a cousin there's people sitting in the building going that's absolutely the truth that's absolutely the truth that's absolutely the truth God knows how to find you God knows how to find you listen your temporary testimony is only temporary but that seed is eternal you may have to go through a lot of persecution you may be made fun of a lot you may be ashamed of a lot of things but that seed God will not lose one [Applause] she's sitting in a different place on the Buckboard she's not washing dishes Ruth is in a different place in the Mansion of Boaz I'm getting to you Esther's in a different spot when she now becomes judge you're not just a church you no doubt didn't understand this is all French it was all Spanish but there came a moment to where
