[50:43] Revelations CH 12 and verse
[50:47] 10 so glad to have you in the house of
[50:50] the Lord last night was awesome here
[50:52] amen just I just I just really enjoyed
[50:57] that last
[50:58] night Revelations chap 12 and verse
[51:10] 10
[51:13] amen and I heard a loud voice saying in
[51:17] heaven now has come s salvation and
[51:22] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[51:25] the power of His Christ for the accuser
[51:29] of our Brethren is cast down which
[51:32] accuse them before our God day and night
[51:36] I hope I read that in such a way that
[51:38] Satan heard
[51:40] it and they overcame him by the blood of
[51:43] the lamb and by the word of their
[51:46] testimony and they love not their lives
[51:49] un death turn with me to Revelations 19
[51:52] and verse 6 I want to read a few few
[51:55] portions of scriptures about you
[51:59] today that one was about you and this
[52:02] one is about you as well and I heard as
[52:04] it were a voice of a great multitude and
[52:07] a voice of many Waters and the voice of
[52:10] Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for
[52:13] the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be
[52:16] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[52:19] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[52:21] and his wife hath made herself ready and
[52:24] to her was granted that she should be
[52:26] arrayed in fine linen white and clean
[52:29] for the fine linen is a righteousness of
[52:31] the Saints and he saith unto me right
[52:35] blessed are they which are called to the
[52:37] marriage supper of the lamb and he said
[52:40] unto me these are the true sayings of
[52:44] God you may be seated may the Lord bless
[52:47] the reading of his
[52:51] word Revelations 21 and verse 1
[52:57] and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth
[53:01] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[53:03] were passed away and there was no more
[53:07] sea right here I just like to just pause
[53:10] just for a moment if maybe you read it
[53:13] this week but Benjamin
[53:16] Netanyahu who is the who is the leader
[53:19] of of Israel he actually came and spoke
[53:23] at our at our Congress and add add the
[53:25] Congress and it felt like it was like
[53:27] Joshua standing before our Hall of
[53:30] Congress uh speaking to them of
[53:33] prophetic times this week he spoke
[53:36] before the
[53:37] UN reminding us that we're on the the
[53:40] brink of the
[53:42] end and how that the AI technology is is
[53:46] so dangerous and of course they know it
[53:48] in a different level how that there will
[53:50] be Wars like no other War take place and
[53:53] I thought he might must be reading the
[53:56] message of the
[53:57] hour thought it was significant that he
[54:00] was the one that was speaking that not
[54:02] just other world leaders was saying it
[54:04] but he was a leader that was standing
[54:07] there knowing that there's a war that is
[54:09] coming their way a war called Army
[54:12] geddon it's getting ready to
[54:15] happen and and we realize that that this
[54:19] heaven and this Earth will pass
[54:22] away last night said that as as brother
[54:26] Andrew was speaking he said heavens and
[54:28] earth will pass away but my words will
[54:32] never pass away so we're not making
[54:35] plans to stay
[54:38] here this is not the dimension that we
[54:41] want to stay
[54:43] amen notice what he says and I John saw
[54:46] the holy city of New Jerusalem coming
[54:49] down from God out of Heaven prepared as
[54:51] a bride adorned for her husband and I
[54:54] heard heard as if it was a great voice
[54:56] out of Heaven saying behold the
[54:58] Tabernacle of
[55:03] God is with men and he will dwell with
[55:07] them and they shall be his people and
[55:09] God himself shall be with them and be
[55:12] their God and God shall wipe away all
[55:15] tears from their eyes and there shall be
[55:18] no more death neither sorrow nor crying
[55:22] neither shall there be any more pain for
[55:24] the former thing are passed away we
[55:26] could pause right there and Shout for
[55:28] the rest of the day and he that sat up
[55:31] on the throne said behold I make all
[55:33] things new and he said unto me right for
[55:36] these words are true and
[55:38] faithful and he said unto me it is done
[55:41] I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[55:43] the end and I will give unto him that is
[55:46] a thirst of the Fountain of Water of
[55:49] Life freely and he that
[55:52] overcometh here we are amen
[55:55] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[55:59] things inherit all things and I will be
[56:03] his God and he shall be my son if I
[56:09] could just drop just a thought right
[56:10] here there was a time where Ruth was
[56:13] gleaning in the
[56:16] field but she was getting ready to be
[56:18] the owner of the
[56:22] field the season that you're in might be
[56:26] difficult for you right now but you are
[56:29] the Queen of
[56:32] Heaven turn to your neighbor and say we
[56:34] are the Queen of
[56:40] Heaven our time here is allotted on
[56:43] Earth if you live to be a hundred years
[56:46] old it's only just a brief
[56:49] passage yesterday for us that's got some
[56:52] gray in our hair some of us has got more
[56:54] greater than others but it feels like
[56:58] yesterday we were boys that's right
[57:00] little girls playing my and just a
[57:04] thought here when I was a little boy the
[57:06] first Vision that I had was at 7 years
[57:09] old and I was sitting on a rock it was
[57:12] in my dad's it was on the top of a
[57:14] boulder that was sitting in our in my um
[57:17] yard that I grew up in and I was sitting
[57:20] on that rock and it was it was the the
[57:22] the sun was warm and I was sitting there
[57:25] just enjoying the day and I had my first
[57:28] vision of course I didn't understand how
[57:29] it all worked I just saw it and I ran
[57:33] into the house and told Dad that I was
[57:35] getting ready to get a
[57:36] horse he asked me what color it was and
[57:39] how it was made up and he wanted to hear
[57:41] all the details of it and it was a short
[57:44] time later that he he had decided I'm
[57:46] going to get you a horse and Mark if
[57:49] he's listening we'll hear these things
[57:51] and so we we went to a man named Mr
[57:54] altiser Mr altiser would had had pinto
[57:58] horses and and for Stephanie you know
[58:00] what they are they're beautiful animals
[58:02] they make good cutting horses good
[58:03] cattle horses and good running horses
[58:06] and so
[58:08] anyway the horse that I saw was standing
[58:11] in his
[58:13] field dad took that bought that horse
[58:15] and it bought it for just literally
[58:17] nothing and the he told Mr altiser about
[58:21] the vision Mr altiser wanted to be a
[58:24] part of of all of that and so he was a
[58:26] great man and so we got the horse dad
[58:30] broke it we rode it rode it for many
[58:32] years and there was a man stopped and
[58:34] said I want that horse and he gave dad
[58:37] multiple times what that horse we had
[58:40] paid for it that horse became the
[58:42] champion of the horse shows in Florida
[58:45] so it had something in
[58:47] it saying all that to say this to you
[58:50] God seen something in
[58:53] you that so many of you didn't see in
[58:58] yourself and you see as life is just a
[59:00] vapor and we're just going through
[59:03] sometimes we don't find our purpose
[59:05] until God speaks to us and then when he
[59:08] ignites that purpose in our life we
[59:10] begin to walk with God and talk with God
[59:13] and and we realize that we can't even
[59:15] got
[59:16] ourself there's times that we're walking
[59:19] in the darkness and and it just seems
[59:21] like that it's just it's just chaos all
[59:25] around us and who's holding on to us am
[59:28] I holding on let me let me just say this
[59:30] to you so many times we think I can't
[59:33] hold on anymore but we got to realize
[59:36] we're not the one holding on to start
[59:38] off
[59:39] with and when he comes by when he steps
[59:43] by on a certain day you'll never forget
[59:45] that day and you just want to capture
[59:48] the moment absorb everything a part of
[59:51] it how it feels what it sounds like like
[59:54] to hear the voice of the Lord echoing
[59:57] where did it come from did it come from
[59:59] inside of you or did you hear it audible
[1:00:02] all you know it was
[1:00:03] him you begin to follow him and you
[1:00:07] begin to watch even our messenger had to
[1:00:10] meet the angel of the Lord in a cave and
[1:00:14] God would give him his Commission of
[1:00:16] what he would
[1:00:17] do just like a Candlestick would be
[1:00:20] placed in the in a generation and he
[1:00:23] delivers the message that message comes
[1:00:26] down from the glory of God now it will
[1:00:29] go throughout the Earth and begin to
[1:00:32] deliver a message to a people I'm going
[1:00:35] to have a
[1:00:36] bride she'll be without spot or wrinkle
[1:00:40] come out of her my people and be not a
[1:00:42] partaker of her plagues and you're
[1:00:44] marrying Jesus Christ not the man
[1:00:47] William Brandon but you're marrying
[1:00:50] Jesus
[1:00:51] Christ before long you begin to realize
[1:00:54] realiz that God is developing a a
[1:00:58] picture a picture of what he thought of
[1:01:01] before the foundation of the world and
[1:01:03] you're a part of it the mystery of Jesus
[1:01:07] Christ The Mystery of it was
[1:01:12] you that's the real
[1:01:15] mystery that's the hidden secret that he
[1:01:18] held inside of himself was you was on
[1:01:23] his mind or let me just say this you
[1:01:26] Satan would have never took his
[1:01:30] life because you are raised to torment
[1:01:34] his
[1:01:35] kingdom now you're here and God's at
[1:01:39] work with you none of us are
[1:01:43] finished but God's taking his master
[1:01:47] brush sister Connie is's taking his
[1:01:50] master brush and he's brushing one day
[1:01:52] at a time let me let me just say this to
[1:01:55] you sometimes we don't we don't
[1:01:58] understand what to the reason today HS
[1:02:02] but God's got a greater purpose in your
[1:02:05] life he's got a greater purpose and I
[1:02:08] want you to understand that you are
[1:02:11] God's crowning
[1:02:16] achievement he he built all the animals
[1:02:19] to fellowship with but he couldn't have
[1:02:22] a level of Fellowship like he's having
[1:02:24] with you right
[1:02:26] now so he'll come maybe to your bedroom
[1:02:30] to your work site he'll come in a
[1:02:32] service and there may be hundreds of
[1:02:35] people sitting in the service but he'll
[1:02:37] make it so personal it'll feel like he's
[1:02:40] talking to
[1:02:42] you he begins to describe to you that
[1:02:46] that your your identification is not
[1:02:48] from your mom and dad it's not from the
[1:02:51] history of your your family tree that
[1:02:54] was your fleshly DNA but he's got a a a
[1:02:59] Higher Achievement that he wants for you
[1:03:02] he's got a bigger plan if we could look
[1:03:05] at it when we're talking about Ruth in
[1:03:07] the field God had a bigger
[1:03:10] plan yet at the time it seemed like that
[1:03:15] she was living in
[1:03:18] chaos can I just describe to you a
[1:03:20] little bit about
[1:03:23] this there was two men on the road to
[1:03:27] EMAs these two men had been disciples
[1:03:30] with
[1:03:32] Jesus they're walking
[1:03:37] away and as they're walking away from
[1:03:40] where they should have been headed
[1:03:44] to they were in a
[1:03:48] dilemma
[1:03:49] Jesus who they had called
[1:03:53] God had had been hung on a
[1:03:56] tree had been placed in a tomb and they
[1:04:00] didn't hang him with
[1:04:01] dignity they hang him
[1:04:06] naked and they heard the words no doubt
[1:04:09] that he forgave his
[1:04:13] persecutors he prayed for them he did
[1:04:17] just only just only a day before they
[1:04:20] had beaten him until he was
[1:04:22] unrecognizable as a human
[1:04:25] B it only seemed just a like short time
[1:04:28] ago that they had sat with him and
[1:04:32] they'd watched him they'd watched him
[1:04:35] have the last communion they'd watched
[1:04:37] all of the things take place they'
[1:04:39] they'd seen him right off of the Hill
[1:04:41] off of a
[1:04:42] donkey now they just can't put it all
[1:04:45] together you know sometimes that's the
[1:04:47] way we
[1:04:50] feel I just can't get it all together I
[1:04:52] I I just can't I just don't understand
[1:04:54] everything the world's Fallen apart
[1:04:57] politics has fell
[1:04:59] apart Sodom and gomorra is worse than I
[1:05:02] ever thought it would be the news is not
[1:05:05] worth listening
[1:05:08] to you get depressed just just reading
[1:05:12] down through and how much worse can it
[1:05:15] be what they're doing to our children we
[1:05:18] don't have a choice
[1:05:21] anymore we rode through a neighborhood
[1:05:25] last week and there was a sign said
[1:05:27] we've already got your
[1:05:30] children I want to tell them they don't
[1:05:33] have our
[1:05:35] children they don't have our
[1:05:38] children and neither are they going to
[1:05:40] get our
[1:05:49] children brother brandom is speaking in
[1:05:51] modern
[1:05:53] events
[1:05:54] that are made clear by
[1:05:56] prophecy he comes to an interesting
[1:05:59] point and I think this is incredible he
[1:06:02] said he said let's just listen to the
[1:06:07] words talking about Jesus quoting with
[1:06:10] them after he joins them he said let's
[1:06:14] just listen to the words that he
[1:06:16] quoted I like these next words he says
[1:06:19] would you like to hear what he said to
[1:06:23] them'
[1:06:26] amen would you like to hear what he said
[1:06:29] to
[1:06:30] them I I would like to say yes yes I
[1:06:33] would here brother brandham it's one
[1:06:35] thing for him to talk take you back to
[1:06:37] the Garden of Eden and tell you what Eve
[1:06:40] look like and then then maybe standing
[1:06:43] in a prayer line Look Back 40 years in
[1:06:45] your life and you know that's God not
[1:06:47] the
[1:06:48] man and now God's going to allow that to
[1:06:51] look back to walk on a road with with
[1:06:54] those two boys on the road to Emmas and
[1:06:56] going home
[1:06:58] discouraged and now he's not just going
[1:07:00] to talk to those two guys he wants to
[1:07:02] talk to you as
[1:07:04] well and he said uh they were all
[1:07:07] briefed on The Late happenings of of the
[1:07:12] crucifixion of the story of the grave
[1:07:15] and the
[1:07:17] tomb and he said they were and the women
[1:07:20] that had seen him and another one said
[1:07:22] they seen him and so course and they
[1:07:24] were all briefed on that and he goes
[1:07:27] right on with the word about that and he
[1:07:30] begins to quote himself in the
[1:07:36] word he says now now let's look at
[1:07:39] Zachariah chap
[1:07:42] 12 he must have quoted Zechariah 11 and
[1:07:45] 12 for he was so for 30 pieces of
[1:07:49] silver was not the
[1:07:52] Messiah was not the
[1:07:54] Messiah supposed to be sold for 30
[1:07:57] pieces of
[1:08:00] silver in in Psalms 41 and verse 9 he
[1:08:05] was betrayed by his
[1:08:09] friends see Zachariah 13 verse
[1:08:15] 7 he was forsaken by his
[1:08:20] disciples he's taken him a journey
[1:08:23] through the word
[1:08:25] Psalms 35 and verse
[1:08:27] 11 he was accused by false
[1:08:33] Witnesses Isaiah as he begins to say
[1:08:37] this he was dumb before his
[1:08:41] accusers and he never opened his
[1:08:44] mouth Isaiah 50 and verse
[1:08:47] 6 he was
[1:08:51] scourged no doubt their mind were now
[1:08:55] beginning to pick some things
[1:08:59] up Psalms 22 and verse
[1:09:02] 22 he cried at the cross my God why hast
[1:09:06] Thou forsaken me all my bones stare at
[1:09:09] me they pierce my hands and my feet look
[1:09:13] at the
[1:09:14] prophecies that he could talk
[1:09:17] about Isaiah 9 and6 unto us a child is
[1:09:20] born a virgin shall conceive and so
[1:09:24] forth Psalms 22 and8 they parted the
[1:09:27] garments among them Isaiah 7 and verse4
[1:09:32] a virgin shall
[1:09:35] conceive Psalms 22 and verse 7 and 8
[1:09:39] they made made a mockery by his enemies
[1:09:42] and supposed to be by his friends Psalms
[1:09:46] 22 again not a bone was broken but they
[1:09:48] pierced his hands and his feet Isaiah 53
[1:09:54] he died with malf factors Isaiah 53 and9
[1:09:58] he was bruised and buried with Rich
[1:10:01] Brothers in psalm 16 and verse 10 he was
[1:10:05] resurrected from the dead and David said
[1:10:08] I will not suffer M Holy One to seek
[1:10:11] corruption neither will I leave his soul
[1:10:13] in hell and he was raised from the dead
[1:10:17] Malachi chapter 3 John the Baptist was
[1:10:20] the
[1:10:22] Forerunner all the types that he might
[1:10:24] have went through too even to Isaac
[1:10:27] being a type of him upon a mountain upon
[1:10:31] a mountain where his father Abraham took
[1:10:33] him in Genesis chapter 22 and it was now
[1:10:37] that they begin to see who had
[1:10:41] fulfilled these scriptures that was
[1:10:44] promised of that
[1:10:46] day it was then after it was late begin
[1:10:50] to see oh well wait a minute you know
[1:10:53] they they then then know that the
[1:10:56] crucifixion friend Jesus was the prophet
[1:10:59] was promised they knew because
[1:11:04] see they they hadn't been briefed on the
[1:11:08] scriptures but here all of these things
[1:11:11] that were supposed to happen at the
[1:11:13] cross and all of these these things
[1:11:15] fools slow of heart to understand all
[1:11:19] the prophets have said and how that the
[1:11:21] Messiah shall suffer and inter into his
[1:11:24] glory and raise him the third day but
[1:11:27] still they don't recognize
[1:11:30] it I think sometimes we don't recognize
[1:11:33] Jesus as walking with
[1:11:38] us and they've had him with them all
[1:11:41] day six
[1:11:44] hours he stepped From Another
[1:11:48] Dimension I'd like to just pause here
[1:11:50] just for a moment how must God must fear
[1:11:55] in that God Realm in that other realm
[1:11:59] looking into our feeble humanity and
[1:12:02] doing his best to help
[1:12:07] us I want you to think about that in the
[1:12:10] busyness of all of this
[1:12:13] universe he takes the time to come and
[1:12:16] spend a little time for these guys it
[1:12:19] was 6 hours in an
[1:12:21] afternoon but I want you to just notice
[1:12:24] and if I can just capture this for a
[1:12:25] moment in their Journey walking away
[1:12:28] discouraged and despondent headed in the
[1:12:31] wrong direction God didn't give up on
[1:12:35] them in your journey maybe headed in the
[1:12:38] opposite direction your world falling
[1:12:41] apart and you're walking and you're
[1:12:43] disillusion and you're in a dilemma God
[1:12:46] don't give up on
[1:12:47] [Music]
[1:12:49] you now these boys couldn't recognize
[1:12:52] who the guy was with
[1:12:54] them though they had heard him preach
[1:12:57] for maybe three years they had seen
[1:13:00] incredible signs and wonders but now in
[1:13:03] that realm of
[1:13:05] Eternity stepped into this realm of time
[1:13:08] being God now he wants to help his
[1:13:13] children because it's more than just
[1:13:15] about your natural
[1:13:17] Journey he knows where he's got to get
[1:13:22] you all you with me these boys wasn't
[1:13:25] going to stay
[1:13:27] discouraged but at the end of the day
[1:13:29] they invited him in and even constrained
[1:13:32] him come in and have some bread with us
[1:13:34] it's getting
[1:13:36] late and they invited him in and when he
[1:13:39] begin to break the bread they recognized
[1:13:42] who he
[1:13:44] was then their eyes was open and when
[1:13:47] your eyes come open to who's been
[1:13:49] walking with
[1:13:52] you
[1:13:55] let me just say it's very difficult to
[1:13:57] look forward and see the will of
[1:13:59] God but it's easy to look
[1:14:03] back and see that you've been walking in
[1:14:06] the will of God all the
[1:14:09] time it's easy to look back and see
[1:14:12] those prints and there's only two prints
[1:14:14] in the sand where there should have been
[1:14:15] four and he reminds you I've been
[1:14:18] carrying
[1:14:21] you I can say the last three years he's
[1:14:24] been carrying
[1:14:35] me sometimes we have to come to a spot
[1:14:38] where these boys would come
[1:14:40] to to see yourself as God sees
[1:14:46] you if not we'll become
[1:14:49] Catholic and Catholics will beat they'll
[1:14:52] never be worthy
[1:14:54] they'll always be doing pentant they'll
[1:14:56] always not be doing
[1:14:59] enough but being
[1:15:01] Believers you're adopted into the family
[1:15:04] of God as Sons and Daughters of God and
[1:15:09] now God begins to walk with you and talk
[1:15:12] with you and it's a daily
[1:15:14] Journey never forget to pray never get
[1:15:18] too busy to pray never get too busy to
[1:15:21] fellowship with God
[1:15:26] are you with me brother Brandon would
[1:15:28] use this statement he said my Ministry
[1:15:31] is to declare that he is
[1:15:35] here and if he is
[1:15:38] here our Prophet may have had to leave
[1:15:40] but his job was done many of our loved
[1:15:43] ones had to leave because but they
[1:15:45] didn't die without faith looking for the
[1:15:48] Rapture but we are here in our
[1:15:51] journey and God has a purpose for us to
[1:15:55] be here the scripture says that we which
[1:15:59] are alive and
[1:16:02] remain so we've got a purpose in our
[1:16:06] life are you with me
[1:16:11] now could we realize just for a
[1:16:15] moment that we are in the season of
[1:16:19] rapture I asked you last week do you now
[1:16:22] believe how many remember that that
[1:16:25] sermon and I I spoke to you about when
[1:16:28] Lazarus was laying in the Tomb and and
[1:16:31] Jesus asked Martha and Mary to to roll
[1:16:34] away the
[1:16:35] stone and when they really come to the
[1:16:37] spot of their life to where that they
[1:16:39] now identified so with him is when they
[1:16:42] put their hands on
[1:16:44] it all the
[1:16:46] critics could was against Jesus but now
[1:16:49] the critics was against them as
[1:16:51] well it's when when you identify
[1:16:54] yourself with the
[1:16:57] word then the critic comes your
[1:17:00] way now we're in a season to where that
[1:17:04] we realize that it must be the angels of
[1:17:07] God holding back bombs even against the
[1:17:10] United
[1:17:11] States but they're they're they're
[1:17:14] holding them back waiting for us to to
[1:17:17] to go
[1:17:18] home but can you imagine when Noah was
[1:17:22] here
[1:17:23] the critics was all around the
[1:17:26] ark and they were all around the ark and
[1:17:29] even till the very last day criticizing
[1:17:33] Noah even to when that they were locked
[1:17:36] up inside of the door and no doubt the
[1:17:39] critics were still there but let me just
[1:17:42] say this you once it begin to
[1:17:46] rain once the bills begin to open up
[1:17:50] everybody became a believer
[1:17:54] everybody criticized Jesus critics at
[1:17:57] every meeting critics that was there
[1:18:01] even at his
[1:18:02] crucifixion but that didn't stop there
[1:18:06] can you now imagine the difficulty of
[1:18:10] saying that you saw Jesus alive and
[1:18:16] well now the road to emus these boys
[1:18:19] experienced Jesus being with them but
[1:18:22] now go tell your
[1:18:25] neighbor sure you did but I'll tell you
[1:18:28] he took me all the way through the
[1:18:29] scriptures and this Jesus was the
[1:18:33] Messiah the difficulty to get the critic
[1:18:36] to believe now you're experience with
[1:18:40] God lined up with the word you realize
[1:18:44] that you're walking in sacred
[1:18:47] moments I want to take it a step further
[1:18:50] we've heard the message of the hour
[1:18:53] we're more than a
[1:18:54] church we're more than a body of
[1:18:56] Believers around the world but two
[1:18:59] worlds are coming
[1:19:04] together not only is Sodom
[1:19:07] coming but Heaven is coming
[1:19:10] too what we experience in services like
[1:19:14] this around the world it's God coming in
[1:19:18] our midst in a supernatural way
[1:19:21] confirming his word over and over and
[1:19:24] over and over again and you feel it
[1:19:27] sweep from the front to the back
[1:19:30] sometimes you see a cloud sometimes
[1:19:31] maybe a pillar of fire and you just
[1:19:34] witness that's
[1:19:36] him and whether you get a sensation or
[1:19:39] emotion whatsoever you take him at his
[1:19:43] word and you see the change in your
[1:19:50] life you couldn't make that that
[1:19:54] change well brother Ron I can do better
[1:19:56] I I can make a change in my life okay
[1:20:00] January one you'll probably start a
[1:20:03] diet January 5 you'll eat a
[1:20:07] donut enough
[1:20:10] said but we realize that it's really not
[1:20:14] you but it's what God deposited in
[1:20:18] you and that which he deposited in you
[1:20:21] is God himself
[1:20:24] self so sister Chassy we're not looking
[1:20:27] at our outward
[1:20:28] man we're not looking at our weaknesses
[1:20:31] we're not looking at our
[1:20:34] frailties we're not even looking at our
[1:20:36] own
[1:20:37] excuses if we could see what God sees on
[1:20:41] the inside of
[1:20:43] [Applause]
[1:20:47] us oh brother
[1:20:50] Ron is it you well if it's not me then
[1:20:56] who if it's not now then
[1:20:59] when God's going to have a
[1:21:01] br I just choose to believe that I'm
[1:21:04] part of
[1:21:05] [Applause]
[1:21:14] it well brother Ron but but the
[1:21:17] difficulties I go through brother
[1:21:19] Charlie that's sitting in a wheelchair
[1:21:21] been in a wheelchair since in his
[1:21:23] 50s but God's been with him this whole
[1:21:27] time you can choose to have the right
[1:21:29] attitude whatever you're going through I
[1:21:32] could choose to crawl up in a cave and
[1:21:35] suffer from depression the rest of my
[1:21:37] life because of the death sentence by by
[1:21:40] doctors and what everybody else thinks
[1:21:42] but let me just say this you I choose to
[1:21:44] God's
[1:21:45] word so I refuse to focus on what's in
[1:21:49] the mirror I focus on the word of God h
[1:21:52] and
[1:21:54] [Applause]
[1:21:57] I come on church do you think there's
[1:22:01] not days where I feel like I can't get
[1:22:03] out of bed I just start throwing one
[1:22:06] foot over top of the other and say this
[1:22:07] is the day that the Lord has made we
[1:22:11] will rejoice and be glad in
[1:22:21] it
[1:22:24] if God has called us to do a work let's
[1:22:26] do the
[1:22:27] work let's respond to the attack of the
[1:22:32] enemy we are commissioned to take the
[1:22:36] word of God and speak it across our lips

[1:22:42] a singer whether you sit in the back of
[1:22:44] the building listen when you go on your
[1:22:46] knees you shake the kingdom of Hell

[1:27:19] it there came a time when Sarah and
[1:27:22] Abraham was listening to a baby

[1:27:28] to be fulfilled no more they were living
[1:27:30] in

[1:27:39] we're stepping into
[1:27:46] it sir there's a season that's going on
[1:27:50] here it's when God taking his great
[1:27:54] paintbrush and he's painting all the
[1:27:58] trees it's going to be beautiful here in
[1:28:01] a few
[1:28:02] weeks millions of people will come
[1:28:05] through our Valley to see our our trees
[1:28:08] we didn't do anything to make it
[1:28:10] happen it was God that painted all that
[1:28:14] it's God that did all of that
[1:28:20] work are you with me it's because we're
[1:28:23] entering into a season what's going on
[1:28:26] in the bride today around the world is
[1:28:29] we're entering into a
[1:28:31] season our expectation is a higher level
[1:28:35] it's stepping into a realm to where that
[1:28:37] we can see what God has said that we
[1:28:39] were going to
[1:28:41] fulfill notice brother brm said the hour
[1:28:44] is here if I'd have been back there
[1:28:47] before the days of that the world was
[1:28:49] created and looked down and seen the
[1:28:51] whole thing

[1:31:11] and I just stood there about from here
[1:31:13] to that tree and he just looked at me
[1:31:15] and he just stood there for a while and
[1:31:17] I took some pictures of him and he
[1:31:20] started eating and I started just kind
[1:31:22] of walking by him he wasn't scared of me
[1:31:25] and I thought for after a little while
[1:31:26] one of these days I'm going to walk and
[1:31:28] I may see you
[1:31:32] again now day I'm going to walk up and

[1:32:39] south and I stood there and I begin to
[1:32:41] lift my hands and begin to Worship the
[1:32:43] Lord and begin to
[1:32:45] pray begin to thank him for what I'm
[1:32:48] thinking on this morning you've been
[1:32:50] with me in the journey
[1:32:54] you've been with me as I've walked
[1:32:56] through this journey and I never want to
[1:32:59] come to the place to where I
[1:33:02] forget it wasn't my human energies that
[1:33:05] have got me here but it's God that has
[1:33:08] been with me all the
[1:33:11] way some would say it's a new lease on
[1:33:14] life I just say this you God was rich in
[1:33:20] Mercy I came across this the other day
[1:33:22] and I'll just share a couple of things
[1:33:24] about it I was studying and I was
[1:33:27] looking in some
[1:33:29] notes and I found this Andrew had shared
[1:33:32] it with me years
[1:33:35] ago one day Thomas Edison came home and
[1:33:38] gave a paper to his
[1:33:40] mother and he told her my teacher gave
[1:33:42] me this paper and told me to only give
[1:33:45] it to just to my
[1:33:47] mother his mother's eyes filled were
[1:33:51] tearful as she read the letter out loud
[1:33:53] to her child your son is a
[1:33:57] genius this school is too small for him
[1:34:00] and doesn't have enough good teachers
[1:34:02] for training
[1:34:03] him please teach him
[1:34:07] yourself after many many years after
[1:34:10] Edison's mother
[1:34:13] died and he is now one of the greatest
[1:34:16] inventors of the
[1:34:18] century one day he was looking through
[1:34:20] old family things and suddenly he saw a
[1:34:24] folded paper in the corner of the drawer
[1:34:27] of the desk and he took it in open it
[1:34:30] and on the paper was written your son is
[1:34:35] adult he's mentally
[1:34:38] ill we won't let him come to school
[1:34:46] anymore I want you to just
[1:34:50] think the Genius of the
[1:34:56] century the school thought he was
[1:34:58] mentally
[1:34:59] ill but there was a mother that thought
[1:35:03] he was a
[1:35:11] genius I'd like to say I'm thankful to
[1:35:13] God that what people wanted to turn down
[1:35:16] God looked at you and saw something much
[1:35:18] different than
[1:35:20] yourself I shared that that little story
[1:35:23] with my family on on our our our family
[1:35:26] chat and then I shared it on a
[1:35:28] Minister's
[1:35:30] chat I thought the timing was perfect at
[1:35:34] the very moment that I shared it brother
[1:35:37] Danny steeman was touring the home of
[1:35:41] Thomas
[1:35:44] Edison he was walking through the museum
[1:35:47] in Fort
[1:35:49] Meers when sometimes you think think oh
[1:35:51] you're just having a normal
[1:35:53] day you're actually orchestrated by
[1:35:57] almighty
[1:35:59] God a man would walk up before brother
[1:36:02] brandom and say these words speaking in
[1:36:04] tongues and it would be three in French
[1:36:06] interpreters and called it perfect
[1:36:08] French because thou has chosen the
[1:36:10] Narrow Path the harder way thou has
[1:36:14] walked in your own choosing thou has
[1:36:16] picked the correct and precise decision
[1:36:18] it is my way because of this momentous
[1:36:22] decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits
[1:36:26] thee what a glorious decision
[1:36:30] that that thou Hast made this in itself
[1:36:35] that which will give and make come to
[1:36:37] pass the tremendous victory in the love
[1:36:44] divine you've heard that over and over
[1:36:46] again but I'm going to tell you this I
[1:36:48] worked for 11 years making nitroglycerin
[1:36:53] and I read this poem every day because I
[1:36:58] had it on my
[1:37:00] locker and people would walk by and say
[1:37:03] does that mean something to you I said
[1:37:05] absolutely I'm on a
[1:37:09] journey and I would think in my heart I
[1:37:12] won't always be making nitroglycerin
[1:37:17] amen so where you're at in your journey
[1:37:20] may not look good for now but just stick
[1:37:22] around keep
[1:37:26] walking the scripture says in Romans
[1:37:29] chapter 8 and verse 28 and we know that
[1:37:32] all things work together for the good to
[1:37:34] them that love God to them who are the
[1:37:36] called according to his purpose for whom
[1:37:39] he did for know he also did predestinate
[1:37:42] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:37:44] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:37:46] many Brethren and moreover whom he did
[1:37:48] predestinate them he also called
[1:37:52] and whom he called them he also
[1:37:54] Justified and whom he justified them he
[1:37:56] also
[1:37:58] glorified now let me just say this you
[1:38:00] God chose you when you couldn't Choose
[1:38:04] Yourself God elected you when you
[1:38:07] couldn't elect
[1:38:08] yourself the scripture also said that he
[1:38:11] called
[1:38:12] you and with an eternal
[1:38:15] calling he can't lose
[1:38:20] you the scripture says he's already
[1:38:23] Justified you and we realize there may
[1:38:27] be a lot of stuff against you in your
[1:38:29] life and you may have a lot of it in
[1:38:32] your memory
[1:38:34] book and Satan only uses your memory
[1:38:37] channel to confuse you war with
[1:38:41] [Music]
[1:38:43] you how many humans do we have in the
[1:38:46] building
[1:38:47] today how many of you does the enemy
[1:38:50] remind you of yesterday days
[1:38:52] failures 10 years ago
[1:38:56] failures Hallelujah looks like about
[1:38:59] 100% of you yeah well you know why he
[1:39:02] does that cuz he's built to be the
[1:39:05] accuser of the
[1:39:06] Brethren but if you could see what God
[1:39:09] sees he don't see
[1:39:11] it so if you could begin to look back at
[1:39:14] your past the way God looks at your past
[1:39:17] you never did it to begin
[1:39:20] with
[1:39:30] now I want to read you a very familiar
[1:39:31] portion of scripture after that is
[1:39:34] settled what shall we then say to these
[1:39:38] things I want you to read it if God be
[1:39:42] us who can be against us let's do it
[1:39:46] again it's Sunday morning if God be for
[1:39:49] us who can be against
[1:39:58] us don't waste a minute don't waste 10
[1:40:01] minutes don't waste a day on your
[1:40:08] accuser he's bringing up
[1:40:10] stuff that God don't even hold against
[1:40:14] you but you hold it against
[1:40:19] yourself
[1:40:22] I was counseling with a man and woman
[1:40:23] one time and they were constantly
[1:40:24] bringing up old girlfriends and old
[1:40:26] boyfriends and they were they were
[1:40:28] they're not here and they were just
[1:40:30] always makes it nicer doesn't it who who
[1:40:33] is it who is it in the church who is
[1:40:36] it and they was constantly and I said
[1:40:39] are you guys
[1:40:40] Christians yeah don't you realize that
[1:40:43] God forgives you yes yes don't you
[1:40:46] realize that God justifies this as
[1:40:48] though you never did in the first place
[1:40:50] can't you see yourself as God sees you
[1:40:53] quit Digging Up
[1:40:58] Bones that's right quit Digging Up Bones

[1:41:55] Lo did everybody get
[1:41:58] that God didn't predestinate you he
[1:42:01] didn't bring you to the Earth he didn't

[1:52:28] [Music]

[1:52:37] Hallelujah now I want you to just think
[1:52:39] just for a moment and I want to take you
[1:52:41] through a journey is this all
[1:52:44] right I've kind of be and bopped a
[1:52:46] little
[1:52:47] bit but I want to take you through a
[1:52:50] journey I stood with David iers in
[1:52:54] Belgium and he took me to an old
[1:52:57] castle and you know those old castles
[1:53:00] they look haunted and there's a reason
[1:53:01] for it this particular Castle was had
[1:53:05] held prisoners of
[1:53:08] Believers and there they would torment
[1:53:11] those Believers and at the end of their
[1:53:14] Journey they had a huge hole that went
[1:53:17] down into a cave that went to the to a
[1:53:19] river that carried out to the
[1:53:22] ocean and they would slay those
[1:53:25] Believers one by one it was Untold the
[1:53:29] tens of
[1:53:30] thousands of
[1:53:35] Believers that went into that hole in
[1:53:41] Belgium I think about their
[1:53:44] journey and that's the way that it wound
[1:53:47] up but I want to tell you what you
[1:53:50] couldn't see was Jesus was right there
[1:53:53] with every one of
[1:53:58] them I was standing with brother George
[1:54:00] Quinn who will be here in a few weeks
[1:54:03] and he wanted to take me to Columbus
[1:54:05] house where Columba
[1:54:09] lived and it was out in a pasture field
[1:54:12] overlooking a huge uh Township down
[1:54:15] there and Columbo would would pray
[1:54:18] through the night
[1:54:21] and as Columbo would
[1:54:23] pray he'd be a church age Messenger as
[1:54:25] he would
[1:54:27] pray people came to witness the pillar
[1:54:31] of fire as it shined Through the
[1:54:35] Keyhole and they would come and it was
[1:54:37] over it was literally hundreds of people
[1:54:39] would come to see that Pillar of Fire
[1:54:42] Glow out through that
[1:54:44] Keyhole the next morning wasn't a
[1:54:47] luxurious house it was
[1:54:50] you couldn't set that piano in it had a
[1:54:53] place it was a rock ledge where they
[1:54:55] laid skins and and blankets there to
[1:54:58] where that he slept
[1:54:59] on but in the morning he would come out
[1:55:02] and he would stand on the side of that
[1:55:03] hill on a on a certain Rock the Irish
[1:55:06] are very superstitious and he would
[1:55:08] stand on that certain Rock and he would
[1:55:11] preach to the gospel and people would
[1:55:13] gather at the bottom and hear Columba
[1:55:16] preach
[1:55:17] Hallelujah let me just remind you of how
[1:55:20] powerful that he was he cursed the
[1:55:23] snakes off of
[1:55:26] Ireland he cursed the snakes off of
[1:55:29] Ireland because they were infested and
[1:55:31] there's not a snake there
[1:55:36] today these are powerful men that God
[1:55:38] allowed to Live Through the Ages there
[1:55:41] was a man that we know much of finny
[1:55:45] brother Brandon would talk about him he
[1:55:46] said under he spoke under such
[1:55:48] inspiration he had been a lawyer and he
[1:55:52] he know he needed God he know he needed
[1:55:55] the Holy Ghost and and he was ashamed to
[1:55:58] get it he was ashamed of what people
[1:56:01] would think of him and one day he was
[1:56:03] down behind the office and he was down
[1:56:05] behind some bushes and he was praying
[1:56:07] and two women walked by and he stood up
[1:56:09] ashamed and he realized I'm ashamed of
[1:56:12] Jesus Christ I need this Holy Ghost
[1:56:15] where I'll never be
[1:56:17] ashamed and he went back and he be to
[1:56:20] pray and God filled him with the spirit
[1:56:23] of
[1:56:24] God let me just say in the season of his
[1:56:27] life in the moment of his journey he
[1:56:31] would preach with such
[1:56:34] power until men would walk down the road
[1:56:38] five miles away and give their heart to
[1:56:41] the
[1:56:43] Lord are you with me now the town of
[1:56:46] Rochester New York is where he was

[1:57:28] hill man named
[1:57:31] Moody you by now you picked up what I'm
[1:57:34] doing I'm picking portions of people's
[1:57:36] lives a man named Moody shook the Earth
[1:57:40] won 500 souls to Jesus
[1:57:43] Christ he had a bad
[1:57:45] day because the town of Chicago burnt
[1:57:48] down one night
[1:57:50] the night before he had preached and
[1:57:52] said next week next week I'm going to
[1:57:54] have an Altra call but he put it
[1:57:57] off and after the fire burned everything
[1:58:00] up in Chicago he went to Europe and was
[1:58:03] so depressed and said I'll never preach
[1:58:06] again and while in while in Europe he
[1:58:08] was sitting in a barber
[1:58:10] shop and a man Was preparing to cut his
[1:58:18] hair and it was such an atmosphere on
[1:58:21] this man it literally changed the whole
[1:58:24] barber
[1:58:25] shop and they finally asked him what are
[1:58:27] you doing he said well I'm away from
[1:58:31] Chicago I've come here I'm not going to
[1:58:34] preach anymore one of those guys was
[1:58:36] pretty sharp he said well why don't you
[1:58:39] come down to our church and give us a
[1:58:43] testimony well asking a preacher to give
[1:58:46] you a
[1:58:48] testimony is asking the impossible
[1:58:53] situation it rekindled his fire
[1:58:58] amen and he came back to America and
[1:59:01] shook America what did he do he
[1:59:06] decided I'm not going to live in
[1:59:08] depression no
[1:59:09] more and God reignited his
[1:59:14] life maybe you've heard of this man
[1:59:16] named Spurgeon Spurgeon is called The
[1:59:19] Prince of preachers but as a young man
[1:59:23] he didn't know whether he wanted to
[1:59:24] serve God or not serve God and he was
[1:59:27] walking down the street with his friend
[1:59:30] and lightning struck his friend and
[1:59:32] killed him that day he decided the rest
[1:59:35] of my life is to serve
[1:59:37] God what are you saying all these for
[1:59:41] don't set on your
[1:59:45] laurels serve god with everything that
[1:59:48] is within you
[1:59:56] can I just go quickly John Wesley's
[1:59:58] preached 88,000
[2:00:00] sermons and he rode by
[2:00:04] horseback not by airplane but by
[2:00:07] horseback William carry
[2:00:11] translated
[2:00:13] 42 versions of the
[2:00:16] Bible
[2:00:18] 42 languages of the
[2:00:22] Bible not only that he translated
[2:00:26] dictionaries how much time did he have
[2:00:29] whatever time he had he he spent it for
[2:00:31] God Peter cartright which you'll be very
[2:00:34] familiar with actually preached here in
[2:00:36] this area brother Brenham talks about
[2:00:38] him talks about him in an interesting
[2:00:40] sterman called the greatest battle
[2:00:42] that's ever fought I'll save this I'll
[2:00:45] save the rest for next time but Peter
[2:00:48] cartright was a man that that he was a
[2:00:50] no good for a long time in his life but
[2:00:54] finally Peter cartr met
[2:00:57] God Peter carite had such passion in his
[2:01:02] life to which that he had went into a
[2:01:05] town and brother Brandon will mention
[2:01:07] the story that there was a building that
[2:01:10] was there it was an old church that was
[2:01:12] no longer being used so he just went in
[2:01:15] and started cleaning the windows and
[2:01:16] cleaning the
[2:01:18] cobwebs and a bully walks in he happened
[2:01:20] to be the sheriff of the town and said
[2:01:22] there can't be no meeting
[2:01:24] here there can't be a meeting here until
[2:01:27] you first whip me Peter cartright got
[2:01:30] down off of his ladder and he said well
[2:01:32] if that's what's next he rolled his
[2:01:34] sleeves
[2:01:35] up and he whipped the town bully what
[2:01:38] you don't realize is that man became the
[2:01:40] pastor of the
[2:01:43] church Hallelujah Peter cartright was
[2:01:47] preaching in a meeting one night and
[2:01:49] there about 300 people
[2:01:52] there masses had gathered and some guys
[2:01:55] walked in and they was going to disrupt
[2:01:57] the service for
[2:01:58] him 30 of them nobody else felt
[2:02:02] challenged to fight so he walked right
[2:02:05] down and he be to fight you liked him
[2:02:08] brother Shannon he walked right down and
[2:02:10] he whipped one by one until 30 men were
[2:02:17] whipped brother Bisal said he came from
[2:02:19] the
[2:02:25] south they came back to service on
[2:02:28] Sunday morning and none of the men after
[2:02:30] that cassus had took place none of them
[2:02:33] felt led to
[2:02:35] preach he said I'll
[2:02:37] preach but he had been the man that
[2:02:39] whipped all those
[2:02:41] men but I'll
[2:02:46] preach and he preached a sermon called
[2:02:48] the Gates of Hell shall not
[2:02:52] Prevail and when he got done the power
[2:02:54] of God fell and they worshiped all all
[2:02:58] day Sunday and all night Sunday night
[2:03:00] and all day Monday and all night Monday
[2:03:02] night and all day Tuesday and all day
[2:03:04] Tuesday
[2:03:05] night and on Wednesday they baptized 300
[2:03:10] [Applause]
[2:03:11] people you've said a lot right here
[2:03:13] brother Ron let me just say this to you
[2:03:16] you may have be in a lot of issues in
[2:03:17] your life but but if Jesus is walking
[2:03:20] with
[2:03:22] you whether it's on the road to
[2:03:26] Aus or meeting you in a
[2:03:31] cave or whatever your situation is if
[2:03:34] you've got him walking with you and God
[2:03:37] is looking from his realm and you're
[2:03:40] walking in this realm and can begin to
[2:03:42] see what God wants to do in your
[2:03:45] life you've got a journey with the
[2:03:53] King Hallelujah Peter cartright was a
[2:03:57] journey with the
[2:03:59] King John Wesley preaching 88,000
[2:04:02] sermons was a journey with the king
[2:04:05] that's
[2:04:06] right however long you've been alive
[2:04:09] you've been on a journey with the
[2:04:14] king I want to ask you one
[2:04:17] question what will you be remembered
[2:04:24] for
[2:04:27] amen what will you be remembered for I
[2:04:31] spent about a half an hour and it seemed
[2:04:33] like an exercise in futility for a
[2:04:36] minute but I talked about John Wesley
[2:04:39] and what he's remembered for and what
[2:04:41] Peter cartright's remembered
[2:04:45] for and we could talk about the Hebrew
[2:04:47] children what they're remembered for
[2:04:49] but what will you
[2:04:51] be remembered
[2:04:56] for and I close with
[2:04:59] this I don't want to be remembered for a
[2:05:01] man that suffered with
[2:05:06] cancer but I want to be remembered for a
[2:05:08] man that when he met cancer he wasn't
[2:05:11] defeated by
[2:05:17] it
[2:05:29] he called you to meet the challenge of
[2:05:30] the
[2:05:31] hour whatever challenge that you're
[2:05:34] facing even
[2:05:36] today whether it's big or it's small
[2:05:40] because every one of us look at things
[2:05:42] different what one will look at
[2:05:44] something that's very small others will
[2:05:46] look like at it's Giants
[2:05:49] but God is with you in whatever
[2:05:52] difficulty you're facing let's give the
[2:05:55] Lord a hand let's stand to our feet this
[2:06:10] morning if you guys could sing could you
[2:06:12] sing that song One More
[2:06:13] Time wouldn't he whne
[2:06:17] he before they come I I want to just ask
[2:06:21] you we walk into a building and we don't
[2:06:24] know what one another's facing that's
[2:06:26] right we really
[2:06:29] don't really don't know we don't really
