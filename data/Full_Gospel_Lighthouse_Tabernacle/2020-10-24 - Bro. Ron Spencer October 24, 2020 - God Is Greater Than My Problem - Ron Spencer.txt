all it's good to be in the house of the lord this evening i'm going to ask my sister whitney to come uh she might kill me and dad for this but uh there's a song that was on his heart and we practiced this one time maybe six months ago and uh so we'll try it so please bear with us this evening i thank the lord that we have an opportunity to serve in tonight every time i tried to make it on my own every time i tried to stand and start to fall and all those lonely roads that i have traveled on but there was jesus when the life of bill came crashing to the ground when the friends i had were nowhere to be found i couldn't see anything but i can see now there was jesus [Music] like a blessing buried in the broken pieces every minute every moment where i've been where i'm [Music] there was jesus this man who needs amazing kind of grace for forgiveness had a price i couldn't pay [Music] i'm not perfect so i thank god every day there was jesus [Music] and the hurting like a blessing buried in the broken pieces [Applause] every minute every [Music] there was jesus on the mountains in the valleys there was jesus in the shadows of the alleys [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] you're always there [Applause] we couldn't see there was jesus [Music] oh there was jesus [Music] there was jesus he's always there [Music] [Applause] he's always he's always there he's always there [Music] i sing that song as we get ready to go to the word this evening i'm praying jesus used me oh lord don't refuse me let's stand tonight i'm praying jesus use me [Music] theirs [Music] and even though it's humble o lord help my will to crumble though the cost be great i'll work for you i pray jesus use me refuse me i bless you brother [Music] andy [Music] [Applause] [Music] and [Applause] [Music] let's just let's just sing that with all of our hearts just now make it real personal to you oh gee just use me please don't refuse me oh sure me there's a word that i can do [Music] and [Music] to crumble [Music] and the cost be great i'll work for you that song has incredible significance to me as a young man many years ago it was during a song like that with brother homer singing that i surrendered my heart to to give myself to the ministry and because i sure fought it with everything that was within me i did not want to be a preacher and so i don't know if i'm a good one now or not but that song means a whole lot to me and so you may be seated just a moment we all are deeply grieved and our heart is broken in many ways and we have many emotions tonight with sister irene's passing this week and she's been a pillar of this church a matriarch of a family and quite a large family and been a real wife to sister to brother meadows and she's a real lady just a real lady she was a quiet lady but she had a lot of power in her you know you know as always as brother dan daisley preached it muhammad ali was the one that did all the fighting but his wife was more than a conqueror and so brother meadows has been has been a man of great strength and a lot of things that he's done but his wife is more than a conqueror we we want to send out our love to all of the family it's a big family it's a very extended family the funeral will be next next saturday at two o'clock here at at the elkton graveyard and it'll be a graveside funeral and um for larry it was a personal personal family thing but they're wanting to invite the church and of course we all have to have have our mask and do the social distancing but it's a great big graveyard so we can we can do that and so i would appreciate each and every one of you that could to attend that service and show the family their love and respect they sure would appreciate that and uh they're just a great family we love them with all of our hearts sometimes it just becomes our opportunity to show our love to them and so we know that satan lost the other day now you see she's only four months from being 90 years old but she stepped into a brand new body and all of these sermons that she has heard through the years came true they come true amen and so god raised her up you see no doubt the family was all gathered there expecting it at any moment things to happen jesus came into the room and touched and so you know jesus is coming you know so many times we think about the rapture coming jesus is coming but he's coming for one of us at a time he's coming for one of us at a time even now and so we don't know when the last our last day will be or what happy day i could think that oh happy day let me wash my sins away hallelujah amen and so we just we just are very thankful thankful for the meadows family and all that they mean for us here amen sometimes it breaks our hearts but with the same time we celebrate amen speaking of celebration we want to celebrate an announcement tonight brother adam fraser asked sister carly noel to be his wife and she said yes [Music] [Applause] hallelujah when i saw that fire get started i knew that baby was gonna roar amen amen i would like for brother adam and sister carly to come and we as an audience will will pray with them this evening i prayed with them privately last night and we're sure proud of them amen amen god bless you sister carly look at it rock yeah that's a nice rock amen god bless you amen why these are two are god's finest and so we're so thrilled for them amen we we love them with all of our hearts and amen really proud i'd like for you to pray with us too and we just want to dedicate their their their engagement period however long or short that will be i don't i don't have that insight just yet but uh this didn't take long amen amen god bless you lord jesus we love you with all of our hearts and lord we just love to see our children be blessed grow up in the message and the message takes life inside of them you have blessed brother adam and sister carly lord when something sparked inside of them they begin to move brother branham says we can't explain it but we stepped out of eternity into a space of time enjoy this life here however long it will be and then we'll step back into eternity again now lord we ask you that you would bless sister carly and brother adam lord may you watch over them whatever type of home that they will build or where they will stay we ask you that you put a protection upon them even now even now in their courtship i pray that you would bless them and lord keep them father model citizens we are so thankful lord this is what the message produces and we thank you for that in jesus christ's name amen and a man and a man god bless you we love you amen give them a great big hand amen we're so happy for them brother jim was pain he was painting at my house he was down on the floor he was laid out painting some bottom trim in our kitchen and i thought you know right now is a good time to talk to him about carly and and adam he can't whip me he's laying down and he just kept saying too soon too soon well i figured i'd put a little gas on the fire you know just amen but we're really pleased for them and pleased for their families and we're really happy about all of that i had something that i just got today and it just i just took me just a little bit of a a little bit by overwhelming and and i just i just was kind of consumed with it and i got this from brother from from sister beth dingwall there's a young man he was his name was terry terry fox and terry fox got cancer when he was a young man and then he and then it was in his lungs and he succumbed to cancer when he was about 21 to 23 and so they've had a run for him he loved to run so they've had a run for him every year as a memorial for that and so every year people participate and this is a sticker that they that they put on their jersey and so and so they they was having the run this year and so the teacher was helping this class of individuals from brother bischel's church helping them get their cards signed and their stickers signed and uh i know most of them but i led this little boy's daddy to the lord his name is ben dingwall well this little fella came up and uh and he was the first one i believe and he said i want to put brother ron spencer on my sticker and it was about if you knew anybody that had cancer that you wanted to run for them well the whole class put brother ron spencer on their sticker amen [Music] it it had a it had a poem or a song beside of it and i thought was quite incredible says and when this life gets hard one day i'll dance on golden streets and ride on angel's wings there's no doubt about it i'm on my way home i'm not there yet where i'm going but i'm i'm a long way from where i was and i hear the choir of angels cheering me on i'm not going back never going back how amazing to know that we've only just begun i'm pressing on i keep going strong i'll keep singing the same song and then they sent me the words to the lyrics of what brother andrew was saying just a moment ago and i just love to have andrew's gift and i just looked over and i said does anybody sing that song here there was jesus and uh he said well i practiced it back in the summer one time and then i hear him singing it out here and so they they they sent me the words to that song there was jesus you know in some of our difficult days and some of them are very difficult just when we think we're going to give up there was jesus lloyd walls called me this morning and it was about mid-morning and he said how you doing buddy and i said well two hours ago i was so sick i couldn't stand myself but i feel wonderful right now i said so it just depends on when to call me so amen so we love you with all of our hearts and we thank you for your prayers with us in the battle and uh what's going on little boy wrote me the other day and says i like your new hairdo i like your new hairdo so so my kinky new hairdo that cancer has caused somebody likes it so boo devil yeah amen i haven't got the real tune to it yet but uh you know you know that's just how it is and so we'll one day get it all to lay back down the same way that it used to lay but you know some days i just decide i'm not even going to put a comb in it you ought to see it that day amen god bless you we love you with all of our hearts and we thank you you know we thank you for your love for us and and uh we thank you for a love for our family and you know one of these days we'll all be back together as a church and um and so we just we just are looking forward to those days and and uh so thankful for what we're seeing going on behind the scenes and and you know it's just like what happened here with adam and and carly i i can almost feel it in the water it's kind of it's going through the building so amen brother jim when you get done with the kitchen we'll probably be working on the nursery amen amen not joking amen amen if you will stand with me tonight this morning i was in prayer and in prayer the lord just turned me just literally turned me and here's the words that he spoke to me and so i quickly begin to dig and here we are and so if you this will be just as fresh to me as it is to you and as i announce my text i mean it more than just as announcement of a text god is greater than my problem now i want you to i want you in the next just few seconds to think about your worst problem worst problem go ahead and bring him the worst brother brahman said many of the of the cases of the of the prayer lines he said bring the worst one first sure he did sure he did worst case i want you i want to i want to just remind you no matter your worst problem god's greater can i remind you just for a moment before we read our text in creation out of nothing he spoke the universes into existence he spoke the word and believed his own word the red sea looked insurmountable but god was greater than a red sea there was a fire with three hebrew children stepping into it and god met them in the fire let me just say this to you when he gave himself as his own son the whole world was against him except for just a little group of people and every demon in hell wanted to see him destroyed but in giving up himself on calvary taking those stripes at pilot's judgment hall he defeated every disease and paid for every sin so god is greater than every cancer every paralytic condition every emotional problem that you've got he's greater than your debt he's greater than all your sorrow he's greater than every problem that you've got tonight hallelujah he's greater than covet he's great enough to change your body in the moment in the twinkling of an eye in a moment change your body to be a young man and a young woman again and then rapture you in the sky and not only do it for you but to do it universally around the world to a predestinated bride god's bigger than the gravitational force that holds us on this ground right now god's bigger than all of that hallelujah job chapter 38 and verse 1. i guess you could say that all of us in our pity parties have you know kind of whined a day or two in her life and if you've never whined a day or two in your life you probably really never had a problem then the lord answered job out of a whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge girl up thou thy loins like a man for i will demand of thee and answer thee where was thou when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou has understanding and who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who has stretched out the line upon it where upon the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy amen why don't you say as we you are seated god's bigger than my problem you may be seated i don't know if you've ever met a person and i don't have a name to go with it right now but i don't know if you've ever met a person that you never asked them how they're doing because in the 30 minutes to an hour later they have gave you a report even maybe in their sympathy but toward your situation they always bring their situation in and their situation no doubt has been much worse than yours you understand what i'm saying and there's people that just relish or worship their problem worship their problem worship their disease let me just say this to you arthritis is not bigger than god cancer is not bigger than god we were in the we were in the initial stages of finding out that we had four stage four cancer brother nathaniel's been a nurse for many many years and he look he just leans down and whispers in my ear he said stage four is only a number it is nothing to be afraid of are you with me now listen without jesus christ it's a death wish but god said i'll go with you even in you to the end of the world he knew this before that we ever got here of what we would be going through but brother donny he has brought us through the prophet says he said one day when adam's race fell back there and was backed into a corner the law failed justice failed the prophets had failed the judges had failed and everything that god sent to the earth had failed and adam's race stood defeated weakness among them death among them everything the death horrors in every place nothing could be done but then in heaven there was one that stepped out the son of god and said this day i will give my life for adam's race what will you do cried the angels what will you do he came to the earth he looked upon a bunch of men and women that wanted to serve the lord and they couldn't there was so much temptation so much sin so much sickness so much troubles on every hand they couldn't everything had failed and he looked and he looked till he found the darkest spot of man's fear and that was death it's always been and he ran right to calvary and got the thickest of spears and throwed him into his heart and cried back said take what i leave you the baptism of the holy ghost and fight we're not a bunch of cowards we're not a bunch of whiners a bunch of crybabies we are warriors the scripture says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord it doesn't take god off off of off of a crisis god knows when the enemy comes like a flood he's got the answer the answer is not in the government it is not at barnes and nobles it's not in a book to try to figure out your problem he's got the answer when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him we've got some words that we use around here we refuse to retreat hallelujah never never never give up brother and i just feel like giving up and going back what too what too tell me what's greater than this just tell me what's greater than this we sing the song onward christian soldiers marching as to war the scripture says in first john chapter 4 year of god little children and reviews this the other night and have overcame them because greater is he that is in you then he that is in the world i want you to understand sister margie sits back there she just lost her brother just this week but she sits back there as a daughter of god i spoke to her today and she said my life has been blessed she said i've been blessed in so many ways and listen i know she's had some incredible daggers and incredible spears that have hit her life but she didn't let them faze her she kept marching on come on listen we're going to have some battles we were promised that we would have some battles and it's not in their our even our strength that we can raise ourselves back up but it's in the strength of god when paul was praying he said and he said unto me god said unto him in in ii corinthians 12 and verse 9 my grace is sufficient for thee when your energies run out that's when his really takes over for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me isaiah chapter 40 and verse 29 i've read this scripture hundreds of times during this season of cancer he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the yous and the shall faint and be weary and young men shall utterly fall but they that wade upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount upon wings as evil they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not fakes brother ron if i could only have my favorite preacher the most anointed man that i know come and lay his hands on me jesus healed us at calvary he healed us at calvary god give us the strength to have faith to grasp a hold of every promise of god hallelujah isaiah 54 never let this become dull to you behold i have created the smith that bloweth the coals into fire that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and i have created the waster to destroy no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the saints of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me saith the lord amen you believe that you believe that sometimes we feels like and i'm just going to ask you this is participation night sometimes it feels like that your prayers just go to the ceiling and then just fall back down feels like nobody hears your prayer feels like nothing's happening but whether you know it or not when the word went across your lips something happened because remember who you are you are a son and daughter of god never let the devil convince you any other way well brother ron the devil told me that that nobody loves me let me just say he's alive so that tells you you've got a lot of people that love you you got a lot of people that are standing with you you got a lot of people that's got their sword pulled with you and they're calling your name and calling and screaming out and hell would have done much worse but god's on your side how can you lose whether you're standing or you're kneeling whether you're in bed or whether you're driving down the road there is power in prayer you're not praying to a man to some pope some intercessor somewhere another you have a direct line being a son and daughter of god with jesus christ himself the creator of the universe that's got power to intercede on your situation don't go to somebody that don't have power to fix it go to somebody that's got it in his control that he can handle the situation that he can take care of it glory [Applause] moses prayed and egypt with their greatest soldiers the mightiest army in the whole world became fish food can you comprehend that just for a few minutes daniel prayed and lines laid down and he slept good all night long and later those same lines ate the people that put him in there elijah prayed and he outruned the fastest horses in all of israel 40 miles you talk about olympic runners he's a prophet old baldy but when he got in an atmosphere of prayer there was an anointing hit him and he got to running let me just tell you there's an anointing that super anointing that's going to hit this bride and she's going to take a step into another dimension there's nothing here that i want to stay here for i want you to always remember when god came down to talk to job about all of his problems he never mentioned none of them i love this god never even looked at his petty problems he never told him now job it's going to be okay your balls are going to get better he never told him you're going to be restored of everything he never told him that you're going to get back all of your cattle and your camels and i know you're really tore all the pieces about your children and you know you've got all kind of critics around you and he never consoled him on that he just asked him where was you at job when i laid the foundations of the earth when i created the the universe i'll tell you where you was job you was in my mind and you're as eternal as i am as eternal are you with me preach with me now it doesn't matter the size of your house or the name that's on your car or what your checking account says that's all just temporary stuff even your body is physically temporary material come on church i looked in the mirror the other day and my shoulders are stooping my muscles seem to be gone hair's doing what it's doing and i said lord i need a body change i really need a body change here he's got one for me first corinthians chapter 9 and verse 24 that's enough about me let's preach about you he said know you not that they which run in the race run off but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain let me just say a lot of people started out with you but they ain't running no more a lot of people said i'm going to go all the way with jesus and they didn't get it past the corner a lot of people were committed for a couple of weeks a couple of months a couple of years a couple of decades and then all of a sudden something else came along i'm committed to the end it don't matter what it looks like i'm not looking at the circumstances quit quit worried about the bulls and quit worried about the animals quit worried about the family you and jesus and every man that strive before the master is tempering in all things he's in control and now that we they do it to to to obtain a corruptable crown but we are incorruptible i therefore so run not as uncertainly to fight so i not as one that beateth the air but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others that i myself should be a castaway i don't want to waste my energies i'm not doing this for a show there's one thing that jesus liked if we can say this right he was not a showman so we're not a showman for anybody revelations 3 and verse 21 to him that overcometh i want you to put your name in that hymn and i want you to read it together with us tonight to ron spencer that overcometh maybe i'm not hearing good it's the medicine's affecting my hearing to ron spencer that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches brother ron how do i overcome one day at a time one hour at a time one moment at a time how did shamgar whip 600 philistines one at a time one gave him faith for two two gave him faith for ten ten gave him faith faith for 50. the scripture said that they should have brought over a thousand but the devil is stupid and so he only brought 600 against one man how powerful is your prayer brother shannon when you utter a prayer the halls of washington do not have the power that your prayer has career politicians that that go around and find suits and do nothing but argue and bicker against one another and get nothing done they got nothing done kindergarteners could do more than most of them guys do but you've got more power than men than set in antiquated buildings with pop and splendor and all kind of discipline to them and they act like children but you have more power because your god is so real [Applause] well brother ron i feel like the weakest christian i got a quote for you he took him up on a mountain and set him down and he rebuked him again with the word and defeated satan with the word of god showing that the weakest christian can defeat satan with thus saith the lord it is written it is written it is written there is an answer in this book for every problem attach yourself to a scripture if it's if it's greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world and you keep quoting it brother branham said if you

my car you know i'm not i'll take a sticker proverbs 27 1 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i feel fear is mentioned 600 times in the bible of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and failed though a host shouldn't camp against me my heart shall not fail the war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing that i have desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may stay home on my sofa and have a pity party all about me one thing that i have desired of the lord that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble that's where god meets his children in the time of trouble shall he hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies and round about therefore will i offer in the his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yeah i will sing praises under the lord brother ron i can't do anything well take that negative testimony you got and start singing you got strength to blubber a little bit and petty a little bit and cry a little bit sing a little bit god help me you got me in it here oh lord when i cry with my voice have mercy upon me and answer me when thou say to seek my face and my heart said unto thee thy face will i seek hide not thy face far from me and put thy servant away in anger thou has been my help believe me not neither forsake me o god of my salvation when my father met mother forsake me then the lord will take me up teach me thy way o lord and lead me into the plain path because of mine enemies deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies for false witnesses has risen up against thee and and and such a breathe out cruelty i had fainted unless i believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living wait upon the lord and be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart wait i say upon the lord hallelujah psalms 91-1 you knew i'd go there he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress and my god in him will i trust i caught that just now i said brother ron you use that scripture that's just a fallback scripture john mccain when he was a prisoner of war those men begin to teach him the only thing that will keep you sane is you get the scripture in your mind and you quote it over and over and over and over and over again there's nobody here that can help you but these words can help you and he learned the entire bible while he was in that room in that dungeon wherever he was at being treated incredibly cruelty don't tell me god can't take care of his word hallelujah surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fallon from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings thou shalt trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that flieth by they thor the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor the destruction that wastes it that noon day a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and be and behold the reward of the wicked because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways use parents with little children use that over your child every day for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways we are the best protected people in the world somebody came to my house the other day and was doing some work they said they don't know what this god does here but he's got 16 cameras on his house well that's just not what the that's only what they can see i got angels dispatched all around that house now i've been overseas and they had guys with with m16s sitting beside of me to watch over to protect me from getting robbed but if you could see in another dimension tonight we would call this kind of what we call half and half services but in that other dimension they're allowed to come and there's thousands of angels that is watching this service because you're just before the rapture and they're screaming get it finished press on hang on overcome we're with you we're fighting your battles for you if you could just get a charge from us i'd say in that dimensions angels like michael gabriel wormwood they get the attention of satan but i say in this dimension there's been men like david shamgar moses that got satan's attention attention elijah jeremiah nahum they got satan's attention william branham got satan's attention and because we're dipped in the same all in the same anointing under the super anointing of this day we get satan's attention come on church i hate satan and he hates me somebody asked me that one day said aren't you scared if you just preach it's kind of like spitting in his eye listen we're the winner we're the winner it's going to take a stronger win than this to knock me down i just so happen to be refused to be an enemy or a slave to cancer i refuse to i refused it to make it god because my god's greater than that come on my god's greater than that fanny crosby to the outside senses she looked like a woman that was poor in a reputable situation horrendous as what you might say to the eyes and most people that were looking for potential knew that she was gifted beyond extraordinaire and she could have been a millionaire in those days but refused it she refused it and today fanny crosby has good eyes and she didn't sell her soul to the world are you with me when we see one graduate from this dimension go into that dimension let me just say this to you i counted a phenomenal incredible thing to watch a lady 89 years throughout the years come to church sick come to church weary come to church when she couldn't hear the sermons come to church she couldn't see very far but she kept coming to church there's people with good bodies good senses that choose to do other things with their life but this lady receives eternal life and phenomenal rewards we rejoice at her graduation her personal rapture takes her home to be with the lord she's shaking hands and dancing

thrown at jesus the disciples didn't have no problem but just as soon as jesus was gone and they were his representatives then the rocks started flying in their direction ain't no running as a christian word got back to jim bowie's mama that he had died in the alamo she said i only got one question where did he get shot and they said well in his front she said i knew it wasn't in his back
