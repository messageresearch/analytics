god every time you come into a room it changes everything father lord we're thankful that your presence is here with us lord father you didn't come just to fill a spot but you came to fulfill a prophecy lord you came to fulfill a purpose and lord we we've come and we poured out our oil upon you tonight lord and we've worshipped father and we've lifted your name lord and we believe that the lord you said you would receive those those praises into your nostrils lord and you would you would bring back father uh the the payment for those praises lord and father we're looking for you to come now lord we're looking for you to to minister to our hearts father we know that god there's just some things that we get into in this this life and the time we live in that a man cannot cannot help lord no amount of psychology no doctor no father no self-help can help but lord when you step into the room oh god you can change everything and lord we're just asking that you would step into every every heart in this building tonight father that you would allow your word to have preeminence father lord that our mind would just be together on one thing and it would be you and you alone father lord we surrender ourselves afresh tonight lord and no doubt many in this building have been serving you for years and years but lord i with them just afresh surrender all that i am to you tonight lord i i ask that you would just fill every vessel lord god that you would anoint a word to come forth a lord that would be so so precise to a need father that only you could orchestrate it father lord we know that you're a supernatural god and you do big things father we're asking you to come tonight and just anoint your vessels father that have come to gather in your presence lord father we look for these things to to be manifested tonight as we pray for them in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen amen hallelujah thank you musicians and it's going to be in the house of the lord with you amen amen if maybe i hadn't got to shake all your hands we've been here a couple times but i'm just brother ronnie and it's just me amen good to have my wife and uh some of our kids with us and we're missing one but it's good to be here with you amen we bring greetings from our pastor brother ray he said make sure you you tell them people that they have a real good man at the helm so we just trust that trust that we could just just maybe speak something that would be a blessing to our hearts amen i know um i told brother andrew when he first asked me about i said you have big shoes to fill and he said but we know a big god and i believe that's the truth god bless you brother stephen good to see amen if you have your bibles if you turn to the book of luke the second chapter we're just going to read the 49th verse and he said unto them how is it that you sought me wish ye not that i must be about my father's business amen may you be seated tonight i just want to talk for a few moments on it's it's the father's business amen now now we can have a lot of things we can have a a a a business maybe in life and like me i got a business and and i know brother ron has a business and a lot of times we we purpose in our heart to to fulfill that business exactly as we set out sometimes you promise that a job is going to get done on monday and it snows on sunday and you just can't get there you know and it's just out of your control but you'd like to run a business uh just exactly like you promised it because your name is attached to that business right but god doesn't run a business like man runs a business when god ever puts his name attached to something he's going to back it up with everything that he's got and and and and no circumstances is going to get in front of what god's about to do so so if we have if we have god to back our business then i say uh what could stand in front of us now i know we know the scriptures and we know a a lot of a lot of encouraging quotes and a lot of encouraging thoughts and scriptures but when when that ever strikes our heart is a revelation that if god be for us then who can stand against us because you see my my god my my father is not just uh just barely making it through or or maybe just just squeaking on by but he's he's rich in mercy amen and he's exceedingly rich in grace uh brother brahm said that his his his mercies are inexhaustible i i would that if we have a need tonight whatever it might be there is a there is a fulfillment for that need in my father's house there there is already a place prepared for that need in my father's house and i believe if we could just tap into that for a moment to realize that that friends we're not sent here without a purpose and we're not sent here just to fill his seat and we didn't we didn't just come across this truth just so that we could almost make it but i believe god has a destination for each and every life i believe he has such a plan organized and orchestrated that you can't help but make it even though you would try to leave you couldn't help but make it because there's something on the inside of you that will see that you get to where you're going there's something greater working within us than we even know about ourselves i want maybe look at your neighbor tonight and say you're a king you're a king or spiritual king is that right now maybe this this this afternoon when you got ready to come to church and maybe you combed your hair a little bit you probably didn't look at yourself in the mirror and think i'm a king if you're like me you looked at yourself in the mirror and thought but there's something greater inside you there's a greater force inside you than even you recognize about yourself and i know i'm speaking to believers i know i'm speaking to overcomers in here i have absolute confidence that i'm speaking to a room full of warriors you might say well you don't know me and you can't say that about me but a church takes the spirit of his pastor and i know that i'm speaking to a room full of warriors in here tonight that know how to swing a sword that know how to fight a battle because you have the spirit of your leader so i know him well enough to know that he can swing his sword so i know who i'm talking to tonight i know that we're more than just just going through a layout to see an age in a dark hour but we will overcome every obstacle that the devil places in front of us why because we've been predestinated to do it every every every person in time every believer that there's ever been has looked to this one hour in time i know that it's words that are told to us time and time again but we are standing at the most important point that there ever has been in history every man of faith has looked forward to this moment since there ever was time since there ever was a beginning since there ever was a fall this is the fullness of all things and i know you looked at yourself in the mirror tonight and you didn't think that you were looking at a king you didn't think that you were looking at an overcomer but you are absolutely an overcomer you know why because how many times have you if you're like me how many times have you said i'm done i'm not going back to church i'm gonna give this thing up i'm just gonna i'm just gonna go move off somewhere listen to tapes now and then or maybe just you know just just get into worship everyone i'm done i'm not gonna go back but i just want you to pat yourself and let yourself know you're here tonight you showed up tonight there's something greater inside you than even your own will to overcome it there's something pulling on you that brought you here then even your your own anticipation to be here but god rich in mercy has brought you this far and i gotta say he didn't bring you this far just to leave you or forsake you on the side of the road but he brought you this far to finish the work to finish something which he started it's his business to come and finish what he started now when jesus was just 12 years old he was left there forgotten in jerusalem by his by his earthly caretakers and then they go out on a journey and and they're gone for uh i think a day and a half and they don't even realize that he's not with him and they begin to search a search for him and where where is he i think no doubt that's that's many churches in this hour is they're going on a journey and they don't even realize that god's not even with them but all of a sudden an alarm came in and they said where's jesus now you think that mary would would have absolute tabs on jesus right i mean she knew how he came she knew that the angel came to her and he said that which is conceived in you is of the holy ghost you think that she'd have her focus on him at all times but you see how the world can get us distracted with with with things and there they were at they were at the the the passover the feast of passover and they were delivering their sacrifices and they were they were making their deals and they were going to the temple and they were worshiping and they got so distracted by that that they forgot that they left jesus behind is there any 12 year olds in here today anybody that's 12 years old imagine being left in jerusalem by yourself just cold by yourself no place to sleep no place to go 12 year old boy but you see he had a greater purpose to fulfill he was about his father's business and there they found him it took him three days to come back and there they find him in the temple and he's preaching to those that should be preaching to him and he's asking him questions that they can't give answers to and he's saying well what about this scripture what about what this prophet prophesied and you see you see god has a way that's higher than any man's theology and and he was asking well what about this this approach that you're taking in uh what about how far can psychology take you in this direction and he's he's asking these questions and he's stumping them every time and just a boy at 12 years old and i did a little research i think it was caiaphas that just came into office as the high priest at that time and there you see a root of bitterness start against this 12 year old boy that he said one day i'm going to get you back for this one day i'm going to get you but see that that that that opposition had already begun the real word came in contact with the false prophet you see there there has to be prophets arise for there to be a false prophet and there would have to be a false teacher to arise for to fulfill that scripture but if there's a false teacher somewhere friends i i've grown up and i've been blessed to grow up in a message church and i sat on the front road and i knew exactly what to say amen exactly when to raise my hand exactly went to went to to seem like i was in the service but all the while i knew that i was missing something inside of me and you see during that time i might have said amen to a lot of things that i now that i look back i say that wasn't the truth that brother was trying to lead us astray but you see if there's a false then there's got to be a true and maybe when you grow up in church and you've been around churches and you've seen a lot of false things and a lot of hypocritical things and pastors that abuse their authority or maybe church members that don't keep their word if there's a false then there's got to be a true there's got to be a true believer there's got to be a true pastor somewhere there's got to be a true believer that'll stand on this word because if there's a counter there's got to be the true i believe i'm talking to some true believers tonight i believe i'm talking to people who have weathered the storms of life that you know the thing about it is we might be in different stages of our storm we you might not be at the same stage as i am and you i might not be at the same stage as you are but we're all going through a battle but the important thing to know is who's in the ship i know who's in my ship i got it settled some time ago i know who's who's guiding my ship so therefore the the waves can be as high as they want but i know who's on the ship behind me i know who's guiding my path i know where i'm headed because i've met him you know friends that's the most important thing we can do is just stop sometimes we just kind of stop in our life and say where's jesus we could be on a journey thinking that we're doing the lord's will thinking that we're going out and fulfilling uh his mission and then we all of a sudden realize he's not with us that's the most important cargo that we could ever carry that's the most important person we could ever entertain now this world would distract us with with with anything it can think of it'll throw whatever it can think of at us but a real believer knows i've been some time since i've seen jesus but maybe it's been some time since i've seen jesus but where'd he go where'd he go and where'd they find him they found him where the word was if you don't know where jesus is at you've got to get back to the word you've got to dig back into this this is the only source of life friends you didn't just come in contact with this message because you're just a a breathing body here on earth but you're an elected seat of god that brought you in contact with the very thing that will give you a rapture the very thing that will give you a new body i firmly believe in this scripture that there are some standing here now i know in our our mental world that's hard for us to grasp and we think how does that come together and how does that cosmic light come together and those those those bodies change but we're not dealing with these three dimensions god's word is not dealing with just three these three dimensions that we see around us what we what we can feel and taste and see but but there's a whole nether world that he deals in and if god said that there would be a people that would never taste of death that they would receive a word so pure so true that it would give them rapturing grace within their life then i believe it with all my heart there's a word here and it's already got rapturing faith within it the prophet said it's already laying within you now friends you looked in the mirror today you probably didn't see that rapturing faith you might have just crawled your way here but you're here you might have just scraped your way this far but you're here let me say that if god if god found you found you worthy to give you a test then he put within you what it's going to take to overcome that test he didn't give you a test so you could fail it i don't know about you but my god does business a little different he didn't show up to the job thinking that he was going to turn it down and walk away my god specializes in projects you know we're in the construction industry and sometimes we come up to look at a house and i see it falling down and maybe it's a little leaning too far and i say you know what that's that's not worth the fixing but not my god you see one day i was leaning over pretty bad and i had a lot of problems in my foundation but god rich in mercy thought so much of me that he came and he said i can fix this one i can fix this project there's nothing too hard for god you can't run too far for god's grace but he can fix it just a touch of the master's head and he knows right where to put it back in order friends a man can't come into a heart and rewire heartbreak you can't rewire depression you can't rewire a broken faith but just one moment with god just one moment with god and that entire circuitry can be rewired just a moment in his presence why because he's the creator the author of life but we've got to know whose presence we're in friends uh peter came came across this situation one time and i know it's a will taught church so it's gonna save me time on flipping through this and and he comes jesus says peter whom do men say that i am well some say that's your this some say you're some say your biels above some say you're just a man that had psychology some some say that you're a man that just did good guesswork and some say you just you just kind of guessed your way this far but jesus said okay but who do you say that i am the personal experience with christ peter whom do you say that i am and he said thou art the christ the son of the living god i would ask this church tonight what does this message mean to you well some say that it's the seven church age messages some say that there's rapturing faith within there but what do you say about this message do you know where you stand on this word i say that it is the christ the son of the living god and though the gates of hell shall come against it they will not prevail why because there's something greater inside that body than you can see in the mirror there's some a supernatural force inside this flesh that you can't see by just looking in the mirror brother stephen i can't just see it on you but i know it's there why because the prophet promised it'll be there rapturing grace he says how's it ever coming to the church don't worry it'll be there don't worry it'll be there hey the bombs are falling it looks like it could happen any minute don't worry church it'll be there it'll be there it may not feel like it but in that moment it'll be there we're not waiting to become uh kings and priests but we are now kings and priests we are now rulers of a spiritual kingdom we are now every every spirit is subject unto christ spirit now now this world this chaos that we live in and there's there's threats of of of nuclear war and there's there's threats of this and and not to mention on top of that we're living in the the darkest stage of laodicea that there's ever been and uh there's just psychotics on the street and you can't hardly go to to to the store without just can't hardly live you can't hardly breathe you can't hardly drive down the street why because it's an attack on every standard that god stands for well let me say to you tonight that you are the standard that god stands for when the enemy comes in like a flood god will raise up a standard against him i say here we are devil there are still some that believe this word with all their heart there are still some that believe this message will produce a rapture there are still some that have a faith inside of them that the world can't shake that the world can't reproduce there's something inside a real believer that's a greater light brother branham said it's a greater light than it was at the dawn of creation that spoke worlds into existence he says the light that you're living under is a greater light than that you think about what power came forth when god said let there be light i don't know what it was that took place but it was a boom and light began to produce and planets begin to spin and stars begin to hang and supernovas begin to blast off and and things begin to come into coming to life but the anointing that we are under is a greater light than even that anointing at the dawn of creation so i would ask this question again if god be with us then who can but stand against us if god is for us they told me just be at home all right then we'll go all the way praise the lord you know i think the greatest the greatest weapon that the enemy has is to try to get us to fear our position in the body you know he can he can he can he can shake the church and he can he can bring national disaster about and he can bring a political disaster about but all that won't shake us but when he begins to to make us question where we're at in the body that's when fear sets in how do i know that i've got it how do i know that if he should come if let me say this if there's a bomb gonna drop tomorrow god's gonna take a rapture that fast before that so before the morning there's going to be a rapture and how do i know that i'm going to make it brother bob said don't worry church it'll be there it'll be there can you imagine how many times you would have given up i don't even think i could count brother ron how many times i would have given up in myself if it was up to me but it's not up to me there's something greater inside me than even what i can what i can produce in my own life there's something greater a supernatural force that lays within me oh i've tried to sit on it i tried to lay it down i tried to say i'm never going back to church again here i am what is it something greater within you there's a value within you that god thought you were so worth it god thought you and your inabilities and your inconsistencies and and your your unbeliefs and your your straying and your wandering god thought so much about you that he would he would blow a body into it and he would step into that body and he would come and he would pay the ultimate price friends i can't pay that price for you brother graham says you'll try to pay that price but don't don't do it because you ain't got the money i don't care how big your bank account is i don't care how much credit you have you ain't got the money to pay that price but god thought so much of you us my goodness sometimes we feel like we're not worth the skin that we live in sometimes we just feel like we're just barely pushing through but what what we need is a change of perception what we need is to change our perception of whose side we're on now friends i believe the church for years and years have been defending we've been defending defending defending but i think it's time to change our perception of of what we're doing in this race of what we're what we're sent here for i believe we're a generation of serpent bruisers i believe we're a generation of snake stoppers i believe it's time to change under the offensive and start start powering down on the devil with that arm you've been given you know the arm will get weak if all it does is defend and you'll get weary and you'll get weak but i say it's time to change your perception and you know just that fast everything in your life can change i know what i'm talking about i've been there i know exactly what i'm talking about how you feel like the entire world is against you and it'll never work out for you and you're just going to wander through this life and just in a moment with god your whole perception changes and your eyes are open to a world that you've never seen before you remember casey in the bible you remember the the the the assyrians were coming against them those philistines were marching against them and it was just two men sitting on a porch you see how the dumb the devil is is that all right can i can i say that see how dumb the devil is he said he said uh i don't remember the exact numbers maybe a hundred thousand syrians marching against two men sitting on the porch one of them had full trust in the lord the other one had got distracted with the pressure of the age i got distracted with what was going on around and you could just imagine put yourself in gehaze's shoes and he wakes up in the morning and comes out on the porch and there's a there's a hundred thousand hundred thousand soldiers marching towards us you could just hear the clap of them marching and get hazy do you see that do you see do you see what's happening do you see that they're marching straight for us i i told you we shouldn't have done that i told you we shouldn't have come against the devil that hard i told you we shouldn't have preached that that that forcefully i i told you we shouldn't have prayed that off that lady i told you and you see that humanity begin to just kick in and he he's worried he's saying hey wake up look at that they're they're gonna kill us and elisha just not even look in their direction we see he'd already received a revelation of his destination no amount of soldiers could stop that see when god's given a word when god's already given a prophecy there's no devil in hell there's not a hundred thousand philistines there's not a hundred thousand demons there's not two hundred thousand thousand demons that can stop that from coming to pass and you see he already knew his place in that vision and he just he just paid no attention those syrians you know where he was looking where he was going to lead them to their destruction and you see they couldn't back up there's no retreat for the bride they couldn't back up they couldn't go to the left they couldn't go the right there was only one direction they could go and that was the direction elisha was looking at it was forward now is not the time to back up and retreat on what we believe now is not the time to back up on where you stood for all these years now is not the time to start questioning what is the truth and what is not now is the time to go forward in jesus christ the bride only has one direction it's forward in jesus christ [Applause] we've already been given a more sure word of prophecy friends he's not going to let us down at the finish line but we've been prophesied that we would overcome in this age no matter how many enemies are against us it don't matter the amount it don't matter the severity friends you might be 32 thousand dollars negative in your bank account it don't matter to god just like that your blood sugar might be in the 700s that don't matter to god just like that just one moment in his presence can change everything about your scenario just open your eyes to see now i want to notice here it was just a perception change for gehazi nothing changed right did god just send those angels there nah they'd been there the whole time wonder why elisha wasn't worried because he knew that they were there he didn't have to see him with his eyes but he knew god will not forsake us he will not leave us he will not forget about us here but he's already got a legion of angels on its way you see the determination when you recognize your position in the body it don't matter what the enemy brings against you it don't matter whether your brother leaves or your sister leaves or your daddy leaves it don't matter if the guy next to you leaves because your your focus is on fulfilling that prophecy you've already been given a word god would you open this poor boy's eyes all of a sudden in just a moment everything changed all of a sudden where there was no hope there was no way out everything changed in that moment hey do you see that do you see that do you see those chariots of fire do you do you see those angels on every hilltop do you see that is that gabriel is that is that an angel of god do you see what's going on here but nothing changed in this world but you see his eyes were open to another realm that was there the whole time and if we could just for a moment see into that world to know that there's more for us then there is against us friends you might feel like you're up against the wall there's nowhere for you to run there's nowhere for you to go and that's just the way that god orchestrated it so you could be up against it and the only thing you could do was put all your trust in him put all your trust in the one who will not leave you put all your trust in the one who will not forsake you and they that put their trust in their lord friends there's more for you than there is against you it's more than just a saying it's a reality but the man would say if we could just if we could just see the the unseen world every time we go to our car and every time we we approach our vehicle there's there's angels sent there just for you now those aren't powerless angels god in just saying those angels to just occupy a seat but they're angels of war they're angels of battle and i believe the lord is so mindful about where you're at that he's already set an angel there where you're not even there yet well you haven't even approached the problem yet and he's already got an angel there waiting to meet you when you get there he knows all about it friends there's no surprise to god but friends we're on the winning side we're not defeated i'm not up against the corner i'm not in the defense i'm on the offense i'm not i'm not defending something but i'm standing for something friends there's been an attack against this message and i can say with all my heart that if you'll stand for it it will stand for you it's more than just words but i've experienced it with my own life just some years ago i hope this is okay to share a testimony i won't use any names just some years ago i was at a meeting in africa a youth convention and and there we were about to start a meeting we were going to preach maybe six services and me and another brother went together who was who was actually one of my best friends and and and and he the night before the meeting he began to tell me how this message wasn't true and how there were there were so many questions and so many things and he didn't believe that that that he was the the seven church age messenger and we're about to go into a meeting and preach together my if i've ever seen a set up for the god for god to do something it was that right there and here we are coming into this meeting and i'm just praying lord how can we how can we overcome this how can we get through this how can this meeting turn out to be a blessing these people in africa don't deserve to be caught in the middle of this war but you can see the forces working and and the angles being preached and the direction being preached and and there it came it came i was supposed to just preach too and it ended up that i was going to preach the last service and i said god i know that you're up to something and on the way to that service the pastor tells me he says you know there was there's a sister here in the church that's a gifted sister and she had she had seven prophecies for this meeting and he said six of them have come to pass and he listed the six things that had come to pass and i said well what's the seventh he said there will be a prayer line tonight and and and the deaf and the the lame will be miraculously healed i'm preaching now friends there's nothing that special about me but i know him i know i know the one that can come in and liberate in the room and i began to preach about the offspring of a creator and what it is to be the offspring of a creator that that your daddy is the creator of all things and the lord began to move and i tell you the devil ward against it he shut the lights off in the building and i don't know if you've been to africa but there's there if you don't have sound you're just screaming out into the wilderness and we're just in a big tin shed there's maybe 300 kids in there we're just screaming away and i began to quote the scripture when god said let there be light and when i said it the lights turned on god's my witness the lights turned on in that building the generator kicked on and the sound came through just like that i said let's finish it now call it now and a young man came up in that prayer line and he was it was his first time ever being in one of our services he said i've heard of christianity but i'm no religion he said this is my first time coming into one of these and through an interpreter i think he was from kenya and and and the interpreter was telling me this and i said well what's your need brother he said well i've had epilepsy since i was four i think he was about 21. he said i've had epilepsy since i was four now if you're a preacher that word means something to you epilepsy it's no joke and his eye was rolling around in his head he'd had so many severe seizures and he had had so many troubles in his life and i looked right at this brother that had just told me that the message wasn't true and i said if what i've preached to you is the truth if what i preached to you is the truth and the law and you believe it with all your heart the lord will heal you will you receive that and he said i'll believe it with all my heart friends i wouldn't be telling you this story tonight if that eye didn't go straight right in front of me and that demon came up out of it and went out the building i saw it with my own eyes why because god will stand for you if you stand for this word god will stand for you why because his name is on it it's his business his name his reputation everything that god is is behind this word he'll stand for it friends he'll stand for it in the dark times he'll stand for it in the sad times when you're all alone and you don't feel like anybody's around he'll stand for you [Applause] friends it's more than just words on a page oh friends if it's not if it's not that then what are we doing here what is all this for why have we given up so much and is it just another good set of morals is it just another way to live life now the buddhists have got us all beat but when god i've said amen like i said to a lot of things but when god ever says amen to something it's nothing but the truth and i will not find anywhere else in this world where god ever came behind a man's words and said amen outside of this message i believe this message is god in our hour i believe it is christ in this life i am not ashamed to admit that this message is life to me i will not look anywhere else for my answer i will not look outside these realms for for an answer from some psychologist or some theologian but this message is life this message will produce a rapture this message will produce a body change it could start right here think about it brother ron just red hairs begin to come back in and maybe my hairs will begin to come back in right here right now there's a people standing here that shall never taste of death why because we're walking in prophecy we're walking in fulfillment of what god already said would take place there's more prophecies about you than there has been about anybody in times past yeah you yeah you who feels like you're weak in faith yeah you who don't even know how you ended up here yeah you who might have been dragged in here tonight there's more prophecies about you as an individual than there is about any other people before you there's entire books written about you jesus was here to fulfill his father's business it wasn't building cabinets it wasn't hanging crown molding wasn't building a pulpit he was building a kingdom go back on your own time and research how many times jesus references the kingdom he was here on a purpose to build a kingdom and where is the kingdom of god it's within you the church it's within you the bride now let me ask how he was building that kingdom absolutely absolutely it is impossible to see the kingdom of god lest she be born again is that not the words of jesus that's why that's the hardest thing for a man to do is get down and be born again to get down and get rid of everything that you think every ideology that you have [Applause] friends there's such an attack against the church in this hour to to get the holy ghost out of the pulpit now obviously you've witnessed me for about 25 minutes and i'm not ashamed to maybe be a little a little uh demonstrative a little excited you know why because this has done something for me this has changed something inside of me you know you're never going to change from the way the way you are if you praise him now you're going to praise him there if you don't praise him now you ain't going to praise him any better there if you if you think that sometime you're going to get to a point where you're just going to get to a place of worship while you're just waiting for that last mile of the road let me say this is the last mile of the road it's time to let it out it's time to let it go you don't want to get there and keep that old dry spirit you want to let it out now it's not going to be any different when we get over there exactly how you worship him is exactly how you're going to worship him there i tell you i want to be next to this brother because me and him can let it out hallelujah worthy is the lamb that was slain god is worthy of every praise we could ever give only a devil would try to quiet the praise of god's people is that okay only a devil would get into a pulpit and try to quiet the praise of god's people [Applause] you don't need to discern that spirit it's a devil we were sent here for one purpose to worship the lord our god i will die in my boots before i let some psychologists come in and interrupt this word come in and interrupt the way i worship my god in the way that's called heresy do i worship by god you've been ordained for it you've been called for it that little thing inside of you that just wakes up it was put there by god he loves it he loves it when it happens he loves it when his people begin to worship him oh yeah oh the devil can't stand it that's why he's attacking the church that's why he's trying to get the holy ghost power out of the pulpit because he knows it's the changer it's the life changer where he used to just be he don't care if you come in and sit sit in church like some bump on a log and hey well i preach he don't care about that they've been doing that for two thousand years he don't care about that but when one believer ever recognizes this message to be the truth he has come in contact with his theophany and brother branham said you know that charge you feel when you're in the meeting and you raise your hands and you feel a jolt come through your body he said you've made contact with your theophany brother alvin ain't no rock gonna steal my praise ain't no bird gonna steal my praise not while i'm alive and got breath in my lungs let everything that has breath praise ye the lord oh isn't he worthy of it hasn't he done so much for us in our life if he never did another thing for me oh glory all honor is due hey they started it i'm not mad at anybody but i'm going to kick the devil out of the pulpit [Applause] it's the only cure it's the only inoculation that will hold friends we all have one thing in common i don't care who you are i don't care where you came from i don't care who your mama and daddy were here on earth we were all born with an infection we were all born with a serpent nature and there's only one thing that can get rid of that old serpent nature now maybe we have i know we have some some some folks in here that probably acquainted with snakes i'm not very acquainted with snakes but have you ever have you ever looked at how they get anti-venom i didn't know so i just google searched it they get anti-venom i tell you i was driving down the road and then the lord just dropped a thought and said what about antivenom and i just i was driving i'm sorry i just and i about had a shout and fit in the car i knew that they used the venom to make antivenin but i didn't know how they got it you know how they get it is they take the venom of that snake and they inject it into an animal and that animal's blood will produce an antibody and that antibody will defeat that venom that antibody produced from that animal will will create so many blood cells and so many things together and it'll come out and it'll it'll actually have a defense against that venom now they'll inject a powerful snake into a big animal like a horse or something that that maybe won't die but but but then they they cut that horse and they bleed them out and those antibodies that come out of that blood is what you get when you get an antivenom now maybe this don't mean much to you but you see i was snake bit one time [Applause] i had a real bad snake coming by me one time brother ram said even that snake is death and if you don't get rid of it you won't be there that's why they're trying to push the holy ghost out of the church because one day i had a sacrifice come for me and he took that snake into himself and he took all the venom of that snake and then the roman soldier came and he cut his side and he began to bleed him out and out of that blood was the antibody by which men are saved we're not going to make it without the holy ghost we've got to have it we've got to have it day after day you know what it said it said for some serious snake bites it requires multiple doses [Music] hey i'll take a booster shot of this i'll take a booster shot of the holy ghost in power you want to feel young take a booster shot of this you want to feel that life come back into your heart take a booster shot of this it's the only inoculation that will hold you when the times come if you get that shot it'll be there that rapturing faith that you're worried about it'll be there it's the evidence it's the check it's got his name on it your whole life you've been waiting for that i just i'm a simple guy i'm sorry if i'm too simple but brother take this piece of paper where'd you get that i gave it to you now you could carry that piece of paper your whole life and never know where it goes never know why you wander never know why anything couldn't bring you any satisfaction never know why just the the temporary things couldn't bring that that real that real the satisfaction of hunger that you had because i got the other half now when you come in contact with that holy ghost this is the other half that house been waiting to come in contact and when it comes together it's a perfect match now what was once in part is now in whole now what's what we saw partly we can see totally why because it's been in us the whole time it's been right in you the whole time that's why the devils tried to stop that move from happening friends we've got to overcome to come in contact with their other half a paper that is the overcoming i can't even tell you how many times i thought i would give up but i'm still here why because something better was inside of me that i couldn't see the father doesn't do business like us earthly folk he doesn't just leave something until it needs attention and then work on it he doesn't pile something up in the shop and just let it store there but his every focus is on you god who's infinite in power his every focus is on you his every focus is on your situation friends it's more than just words it's life the position of this age is so dark there's so much pressure on on on on on everyone but we we if you've been here if this is your first time in a church you've sat here for a while you've heard too much just in this few minutes to walk out of here and not be responsible most of us have been sitting in here our whole life and we've heard way too much to walk out of here and not be responsible for what we've heard now let me ask you why god would take the time would go through the effort why he would cause a man to give his entire life to bring forth a word so that we could walk out of here and say well that was a good service [Music] but god set this up he brought you here for a purpose he brought you here to receive him at the exact moment that he had set up before there ever was his time remember the woman at the well i have need to go by the way of samaria why did he have need to go by there because there was an elected seed that needed to bump into him along the way you know my god is really good at putting himself right in your way where you've got to come in contact with him and you may think well i'm just here my own accord he hath made us oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize and this is one of them he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the lord all of grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are kings spiritual kings oh we are going to be kings upon the earth with him as he sits on the throne but now we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual kingdom that's a word prophet those are words to live by we reign now over a spiritual kingdom i was listening today to a message and brother braham said if we can only realize that we're believers and that phrase really struck me if we could only realize that we're believers hey this is my this is my rights this is my authority remember brother bannon would tell the story about that slave boy who came they said hey why is he so much better than the rest of the slaves why he's so much taller he's stronger he's he he does exactly what you tell him do you make him sleep somewhere different no do you feed him different no what's different about him whoa where he comes from his father is a king friends we got we got we got a brother in our church who's uh who who came over from england precious brother and he decided here last year that he was going to become a united states citizen he'd been here for years he was going to become a u.s citizen and so we went to his party of being a u.s citizen and i asked him i said well so what's it like to be a u.s citizen he said well it's not that much different except for i'm entitled to everything that you're entitled to and when i go home i'm an alien in my own country i just got a big smile on my face so you just became a citizen but you're entitled to every right that i've had my entire life yeah i thought my what a victory for our young people if you take on this new citizenship you're given every redemptive right that that men for thousands of years have strived for and you might just come in tonight for the first time and this thing might end tomorrow but you're entitled to every right that is in that kingdom and let me say this is not just some kingdom over in africa where my father is king this is another kingdom in another world where you have a new green card a new citizenship where you've taken that inoculation and you're entitled to every right that's in that kingdom hey that over there my daddy owns it salvation my daddy owns it healing in my body my daddy owns it holy ghost my daddy owns it that prodigal son my daddy owns it that depression my daddy owns it you see you're entitled to every right that's in that kingdom that's why we don't feel at home in this world anymore we go to walmart brother stephen and i feel like i'm i'm at war why because you're not of this kingdom you've taken a transfer there's been another passport given to you daddy is it gonna be there i checked the door twice son it's there will it be there when the death angel comes it'll be there when the death angel comes will it be there when when i'm down by myself and that depression and anxiety comes on me it'll be there when that demon comes to torment it'll be there oh will it be there when the palms begin to fall oh it'll be there it'll be there church you just watch and see you can call me a fanatic you can call me a man worshiper you can call me a a zealot you can call me a religious freak you can call me whatever you want but one of these mornings one of these mornings you're gonna call this boy god that's what we're here to do that's the commission we've been given to fulfill the word we are not defeated we've been seen in a vision of victory and i saw her and she was walking in a line and she was not divided she was singing onward christian soldier not backup not retreat onward christian soldier marching ass to war with the word of jesus going on before like a mighty army all one body we we're not divided we're walking in the fulfillment of prophecy i believe with all my heart that when brother branham saw that prophecy he saw this group of people standing here and others like you across this world and we were marching in one unison to one beat to one song and what was it this word we've been called for a greater purpose than any man that ever come before us that's what happened with enoch he walked so close to god the devil didn't know what to do with him i can't stop him he's got such a relationship you know what makes the difference between you and every other nominal church member out there you're not believing this to dodge hell you're not believing this because you're scared of a lake of fire you're not believing this because you're scared of the of the the battle of armageddon you're believing this because you met somebody you're believing this because somebody special came into your life one day and there was a love a connection that happened between you and him there was something that happened between you and him that you knew that you knew there was something lasting there i'm so glad that i could serve god because i love him with all my heart not out of fear not out of fear of judgment or fear of condemnation but i love the lord with all my heart and with all that is within me that's our one commandment to love the lord why because he came for us friends you're already spoken for the devil can't have you devil can't have you brother ron you've already been spoken for you've already been spoken for by the lord you know what you're already under ownership of another kingdom he's got no rights within this kingdom he doesn't have a green card to travel this kingdom he's not got free tourism visa in this kingdom i say it's time to change the narrative and get the devil out of our kingdom say devil you have no rights in my household you have no rights tormenting my children or my family you have no rights getting in between my marriage and my relationship you have no rights getting between me and the lord friends there's got to be a there's got to be somebody fulfill this i believe it's us i can't put your name there but i believe with all my heart it's us i say you gotta raise your hand for yourself i believe with all my heart it's me if there's just one gonna make it it's gonna be me if there's just one gonna see the lord's christ it's gonna be me why because there's something within you that's pulsating that out of you you didn't put that there you would have given up friends if it was up to our mortal ability we'd have given up that's why i'm confident of this very thing if god is for me let me tell you friends i've had to see him i've had to know that he's for me i've had to know you can i just i'm not going to go too much longer but i can share personal testimony there was a time i was at a crossroads i really needed a word from the lord anybody ever been there wondering what decisions you made and what direction you took i i really needed to know that the lord was was watching over me i'll never forget that time i got desperate for the lord and i i i believed i had met him i believed i had the holy ghost but i just needed an answer about what i was doing in my life and and and and i actually had just gotten back from a trip from the philippines and believe it or not preachers got issues too we have to pray up too and i got back from this trip and i just the trip was successful and the lord came and met us there but just inside i had this burden i had this burden on me and i just couldn't shake it i i just i just wanted to be free from it and i began to pray and i got down one night i remember i prayed all night till about four in the morning and just waiting lord there's that you promised there would be something supernatural take place nothing just just quiet just you could hear a pin drop i went up got ready for work well that weekend we were going to have some special meetings at church friday came powerful service saturday came even more powerful service sunday morning came and i'm thinking lord i've got to have something and the lord used our brother ron spencer and he was talking about abraham and he was talking about how there were many times that abraham would have given up if it not been for the lord keeping him there were many times that abraham would have just just the prophecy of isaac coming to pass there are many times he would have just given up on him but the lord was keeping him in that service he began to the lord began to just discern my heart let me tell you friends i was trying to sit on my hands as best i could but there's something there's something in you that you can't sit on they began to pull pull it out of me and the lord spoke directly to my heart actually called me up spoke directly to my heart i actually held my hand right here and spoke directly to my heart i i don't know if i ever told you this part of the story but but there you had grabbed my arm about right here and for about three weeks after that i felt the impression of a hand right here i believe with all my heart the angel was standing there i believe with all my heart because no man would know that have we ever never had longer than a 10 minute conversation no man would know that but you know what was preached before that in that meeting in that same service you read a quote and you said cancer might have you in a corner but he's already made a way of escape he said depression might have you in a corner but he's already made a way of escape you might be up against a wall in a bad battle in your life but he's already made a way of escape i can stand here and testify that if you stand for the word he will stand for you now it's not just me one time the prophet the prophet had a burden on his life you remember he couldn't shake the burden he couldn't get rid of the burden it was a burden to serve the people people were getting filled with the holy ghost people were getting healed people were things were taking place but he couldn't shake this burden and he walked with it for years but there one day something as simple as not shooting a deer you remembered your promise now i'll remember mine friends how many promises have you made the lord you remember your promise now i'll remember mine i can witness it i can testify with all my heart if you stand for this word the gates of hell cannot prevail against it they're going to try but they cannot prevail against it flesh and blood had not revealed this to you simon barjona but my father which is in heaven hath revealed this unto you and i say that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it now your name might have been simon barjona in another verse you might have been just some church member in another verse but it got a lot more personal when he said he's gonna build his church upon this rock and he said i say unto you that thou art my bride and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it though they try with everything they've got they shall not prevail against the people that know where they stand they that know their god shall perform exploits i believe that's speaking about us in this age i believe he prophesied there would be a people that would do a greater work and i give unto you the keys of the kingdom of heaven you got the key friend peter then went and backslid a couple a couple verses later gets rebuked by jesus but he says worry not peter for i prayed for you and at that time you'll know how to use the key brother brown said on that pentecost morning peter put the key in the lock and that arm of fake turned the key and he said this is that which the prophet joel has spoken of to come in this day i believe this is that which william branham spoke of to come in this hour that there would be a bride's revival strike the earth i believe if you want to find the elkton revival you're looking at it you're going gonna find some policemen someday say hey where's the welsh revival you're looking at it this is the bride's revival and the move is on for the bride these aren't just sayings or catchphrases this is what i believe it's us friends he was looking at us walking in line with the word yes and our faults yes and our failures but it was all ordained by god let me say that he didn't put you through a test that you didn't need let me say that god wasn't wasting this time when he drug you through the fire but he said buy of me gold tried in the fire heroes aren't born they're forged i'm talking to a church of heroes people that can stand in faith and say no matter if he slay me i'll trust him anyway no matter what may come i'll trust him anyway why because you've been forged in a fire you were gold all the time but it took that fire to bring the brightness out to you friends if our music players could come there's something about you that the world can't even see they're trying to figure out the value of you and what makes you valuable they'll never see it it takes a change of perception to see it about yourself we're not losing this battle i'm not retreating i i don't know i'm like that little guy who's blowing the trumpet he didn't know that he didn't even know how to tune the general told him he said see sound the retreat we're losing the battle he said i i he sounded the only retreat he knew which was move forward charge we're weary yet pursue we want to give up but we can't there's something greater within us we've got to charge the enemy we've got to move he said i never learned the bugle to retreat well i gotta say i never learn retreat either why would i waste my time with something i'm never gonna fulfill i am going to fulfill a body change i'm going to fulfill a rapture i'm going to fulfill one of these mornings i don't know what sensation is going to be like brother brown said it'd be like when you just worship the lord and you feel that just august presence come in and you feel the presence of the lord begin to sweep down upon you he said it will be just like that maybe you'll take a step a little higher but all of those trials led to that moment heroes are forged i think about a a fine brother who went through many battles questioning maybe where he was directed but you see he met him he met the lord and there him and silas are praying for a girl and they pray this demon spirit off of her and they throw them in jail hey it may happen to us paul wasn't discouraged by that he said they might kill me tomorrow it would be my honor to die for this gospel and they threw him in the jail that wasn't the end of story for paul but you see that trial was ordained of the lord i can just imagine a one guy jailed up in there he says hey what are you in for i murdered this guy yesterday yeah it's awful what are you in here for i didn't pay my taxes what are you in here for i stole a chariot what are you in here for you you two guys don't look like you belong in here oh well we prayed for a girl and the spirit came up out of her and she was delivered in that very instant and that's why we're here he said you you for real oh yeah i'm for real and you see where maybe not one believer was ever in that room before paul and silas entered that room and the atmosphere began to change around them began to say well by what authority did you pray that spirit off of that girl by the only authority there is by the name of the lord jesus christ and when we prayed in the name of the lord jesus christ that spirit came up out of her and she was delivered and she's walking free today and they put you in jail for that so it is and they're wondering well what are you what are you going to do are you discouraged no i'm not discouraged tell us about why is this the most powerful name that there ever was i could just imagine paul just fade into tears if you didn't own me you see i used to be saul and one day i met him one day he he knocked me off my high horse tell him about it silas silas tell them about that upper room silas oh my goodness we were all in one accord gathered in the upper room and that pillar of fire came over the building and there was one pillar of fire all these years over israel but in that moment it divided itself up into 120 vessels in that room and every lick of fire began to fall on every one in that building and i received a new birth in that moment tell them silas i've never been the same ever since that moment i've never been the same since that hour oh my whole life has been rearranged why because he put himself into me how'd it happen for you paul i was riding on my horse when a light greater than any light i've ever seen struck me blind and then what happened oh oh oh just imagine paul just thinking back on what the lord's done for him what it'll be like when we get there friends i just think of paul amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me i once was lost but now i found i was blind but now i see my chains are gone [Music] [Music] me [Music] his mercy reigns on [Music] is that really what happened oh that's what happened with all my heart oh if i could just get you to meet him if if he would just come into this room but you see they were there locked up and i just imagine the chains started to shake when you worship the lord things start to happen that's why the devil hates it to take place when you worship the lord things began to change in your life things that you thought weren't movable began to move and attitudes that you thought weren't fixable begin to change themselves and depressions that you thought you'd never lose begin to just fall off of your body when you began to worship the lord i'm not beside myself i know him i've been there when it when it happened to me and paul began to witness to these brothers in the jail oh if you could just meet him if he would just come down in here oh he's so faithful he's so good and i just would imagine the jail began to shake chains began to rattle you see on the other side of that door was a jailer that was listening to every testimony that was listening to every word they were singing the songs of praise and he began to get a little closer to the door he began to crane his ear in a little bit something began pulling him into that conversation you see you're not going through this test for no reason but there's a jailer on the other side of this test and he began to pull himself into the stand closer to the cell and paul just began to say oh if you could just meet him amen there is [Music] oh there is power in the name of jesus oh there is power in the name of jesus you could just feel that presence settling down to that jail cell every chain began to shake every wall began to quake before you know it there was just rubble laying there that's what happens when believers begin to worship the lord he'll come and change the situation around you that jail that you think you've been in your mind he'll break it down in a moment in his presence just worship the lord and watch it change watch just a moment in his presence change your life that jailer began to say oh no they're going to escape this is a this is a this is i'm going to get punished with death and watch the grace of god call out oh no you're not you're not going to kill yourself soldier boy this was all set up for you this was all a big setup to get your attention that you might come to me you see i've sent my two messengers here you might have thought you had the upper hand you might have thought that that
