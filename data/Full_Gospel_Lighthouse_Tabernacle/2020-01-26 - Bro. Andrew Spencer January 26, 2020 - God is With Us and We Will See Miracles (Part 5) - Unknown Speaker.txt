========================================

Oh [Applause] [Music] because [Applause] more severe because of years is a god that hasn't changed it's a god that is a rock is our foundation he's our strength he's our friend he's our friend to think that that Jesus would call us friends it's overwhelming to me that Jesus would calm his friend that he's not ashamed to call me his brother what a god I so love him with all of my heart I know you do as well because you wouldn't be here if you knew that shows a desire that you got on the inside of you then you want to hear more from you have your Bibles as evening will will turn over to the book of jeremiah chapter 10 and verse 6 I'd like to continue our thought on God with us I'm gonna be remembering brother on tomorrow morning actually afternoon 12:45 tomorrow evening at UVA and and we will keep you apprised to everything that is going on and and keep you updated by the way of text message and if you know somebody that doesn't receive those and you want to share that with them by phone call please do so will be kind of flooded by by just sending out those things so if you wouldn't mind just sharing that and we want the brighter in the world to be praying and we are absolutely believing God's report and expecting a good report and man we we heard on the spark of expectation and we are expecting great things from a great God and so we just want to be remembering brother on that we don't know exactly how evasive that will be and what not so we're just asking that that the God would would anoint the doctors and the everything that goes on there and we know that he will because they're not just working on somebody they're working on on God's servants so so we just want to be remembering those things and if you have not if you did not and have way of access to Internet if you have not listened to brother Tim Pruett sermon from today I ask you to do that it is a it is such a overwhelming thought and it is something that you need to hear on claiming your rots and and speaking on the whole how sufferest and stand and be healed it's such a powerful word and I encourage you to do so this week while you have time and man Jeremiah chapter 10 and verse 6 amen bless it be the name of the Lord amen for as much as there is none like unto thee O Lord thou art great and thy name is great in might who would not fear the Oh king of nations for to thee nothing a pertain it is do him the fear fear is do unto God for as much as among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is none like unto thee but the Lord is the true God can you say the true God he is the Living God and an everlasting king at his wrath the earth shall tremble and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation thus shall you say unto them the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth even they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens he hath made the earth by his power he hath established the world by his wisdom and has stretched out the heavens by his discretion when he uttered his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens and he calls us the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures that's the God that is with us and that's the God that has got your back amen look at your neighbors say God's got my back a man with that in mind let's call on the God of heaven just now Heavenly Father we call upon you Lord Jesus and we realize that what we have been given this evening as an opportunity that men that men have so desired throughout years to be standing in this age and be standing in this moment father we are we are privileged people this evening to be sitting here in the presence of the king and we pray that that your people would feel your presence and and while we are passing by their way that you would reach out and touch them Lord I know there's many that are sick and been battling different things but we believe you're greater than a common cold greater than the flu you're greater than a cough you are a god that has healing in his wings and we pray that that you would stretch out your wings across this congregation just now and and that that the healing virtues of Christ would flow over this local body father lord I pray you administer to them in a supernatural way Lord one more time I yield my vessel to you I pray as as it were I could just so go sit down in a corner and you could use this vessel to speak to your children Lord I pray they not see me or hear me but may they hear you speaking tonight or will you or our vessels and ask God you'd have that on the way in Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you be seated in the name of the Lord turn with me over to Hebrews chapter 1 God is with us and we will see miracles jesus said I am the way the truth and the life Jesus is the way he's not a way but he's the way Jesus is not part of the truth but he is the whole of the truth jesus said I am he said whenever time you hear him say I am that means I am present tense it is right now and he said that I am the resurrection that means he's a resurrection right now he said I am the door I am the life I am the bread I am the water I am the fountain I am the root and offspring of David he's the same yesterday today and forever he is in a class all by himself there's nobody else like Jehovah there's no God like our God he's in a class all by himself there ain't nobody that's got a name like Jesus it is his name that ever knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord there's no one beside him none like him none before him he's in a class all by himself but he has a name that is a sweetest name that's ever been uttered across mortal tongues the name of Jesus brings Almighty God by our way and if you want deity in your midst you welcome and receive the word in your midst now a Hebrews tells us that God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past unto the father's by the prophets hath and these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he have appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world's who being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person and upholding all things bearing all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high we are gathering a picture of a God that is with us now we read this with you to you last weekend on end the message what was the Holy Ghost given for he said now God poured himself into Christ correct Christ poured himself into the church therefore now watch at that day you will know that I am in the father and you are in me and I am in you at that day you'll know it for it's the whole thing the whole thing is one plan of redemption coming down that God coming back to live and dwell with and commune to his people as he did at the beginning now then as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions gets his church to a place that he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship then there will come and eat him when he gets his church on speaking conditions where they're communicating back and forth to each other when when you're not afraid to to lift your voice when you're not afraid to pray when you're not afraid to go out in public and stand as a as a testimony as as of the living Lord Jesus on speaking conditions where where he can whisper those those sweet secrets into your ear and he can speak lit the air to you and you can speak lip to ear to him on speaking conditions with Almighty God we're living in an hour there where men have long to be in this day on a day when God has dispersed himself like a never before when he released his power the same power that came down on the day of Pentecost has been released in this hour we have seen that God moving power moving demonstration as he is the God that wrote the word he's the God that is obligated to keep that word he's a god that is obligated to back up that word Superman needs his cape but I'm not Superman I got a Super God that lives on the inside of me we have seen this God as he is the one that wrote the word that had told us that these things were going to come to pass he's a god that said these things he's a god that has backed up all of the things that have happened in our midst and we have seen this God and this day like never before him perform miracles that were too hard for doctors to figure out there were cases that come up come up against God in this day when because Satan has tried to hide his very best to try to hide from doctors and there was a prophet on the scene that would say Oh Satan now has heard from the doctors but you can't hide from God and there have been hard cases that have come against that that have come against this message but this message is not a man this message is not just pictures this message is Christ we've not come here to talk about we've not come here to talk about a church we've not come here to talk about a man we've come here to talk about Jesus Christ we've come here to talk about the God of heaven we've come here not to talk about a message but to get in a message and that message to get on the inside of you and I and that message to live like never before you see if all this is is just me preaching it brother on preaching on Saturday and Sunday and you go back out to your job on Mondays and you go back into the same routines what good was your weekend spit for you see it's got to be more than you going to church and spending two or three hours there and hearing a man standing behind the pulpit and shout and talk about a god that is not bad that he's still living but is he really living on the inside when you go to work on Monday I know I don't want to this is not about just going through the everyday life and you proclaiming that God sent a prophet it's way past that it's past God's and a prophet but now it is a people of the open book taken what that prophet said and living it out in this day this is modern events made clear by prophecy we've seen this God and move and operate in human flesh just like he did as he did 2,000 years ago we've seen him create life we've seen him speak to storms and he speak him right out of existence we see them curse the enemy and the enemy thwarted and defeated and destroyed we've seen this God do impossible feats we are seeing a God who is invisible work in humanity and declare himself Jehovah now he does not have to he does not to have to perform miracles to prove that he's God but because his word said that he would is why he performs miracles you see God is with us and we will see miracles and why are we a guarantee that we're going to see miracles it's because the Bible said so are you with me because the Bible said so and there is a people on the face of the earth that have a god-given character to handle the power that's been placed in her hand we have seen a God work in our midst like a never before we've seen the Kings sword and go into acts and as it went coming as it came and then did not come with a cease upon it but they've come ready to do work it come to cut and it come to tear down we have seen the third pull the opening of the word in operation behind the veil of humanity behind that tent it is not a public show but it is it is veiled behind humanity and though the world though the world may not see it we realize that there are carnal impersonations of the first pool and the second pool but there can be no impersonations of this third pool Satan don't know nothing about it but there's a people on earth that knows exactly what it is and they're putting it in the action what is it it's the king sword this is the King's word and the Bible said that where the word of a king is there is power hello whether man would tell us that when to omnipotence come together that something has got to shake when an omnipotent God and an omnipotent faith in Almighty God comes that qamar oculus has to be performed are you with me the Bible said that he is omnipotent he is all-powerful and brother Branham said that when that omnipotent faith that means an all-powerful faith where is that going to come out of it's got to come out of a people that believe more than God's able to do it that but they believe that God will do it come on somebody the church world believes God is able to do it but we're are people that realize that God will do it God ain't backing off of his promises it's we that get troubled by the things we see but don't you be scared by the times that's standing your way the bigger the child the bigger they fall hello if you want a victory you got to have a battle we are in a battle for spiritual places right now for heavenly places and Satan wants her position Satan hates you he hates me and I hate him but I know that God is my friend hallelujah that's the God who is with us the all-powerful war now in Jesus when he come into the city over in the book of John chapter 11 when he come over there into the city of Bethany when his friend Lazarus had died and been dead for days now it now to think that all of the people that were sitting around Jesus when the news came to Jesus that his friend Lazarus was dead what are what a friend we have in Jesus and when the news came that his friend Lazarus was dead then Jesus spoke these words that this sickness is not unto death you see because because Jesus knew what was on the other side of it now if you were a corridor believer and you are sitting around Jesus and you were just looking at the symptoms you would think well this is nothing but another false prophet when Lazarus had been dead for days oh but I think God that there's some believers that look past the symptoms that look past what they can see with their five senses what what they can look past with their eyes come on somebody but look at the faith that Martha had when she came to him in verse 21 she said then said moth under Jesus Lord Lord if I would have been here my brother had not died she was not rebuking Jesus for not being there she was letting Jesus know the faith that she had in him she realized that if Jesus would have been in the house Lazarus could not have died but this was a sickness that was not into death but this was for the glory of the Lord if you'd have been here he wouldn't die whew but I love this but I know now but I know that even now whatsoever they will ask God God will give it to you even now Lord I know that you have the power to speak into existence I know you have the power to ask what about you and your friends come to you I heard you're a Christian I heard you believe in divine healing what about you asking this ain't just the pastor asking this ain't just the deacon asking this is you asking jesus said if you shall ask anything in my name you're not operating in a week God's name you're operating in the God of heaven but even now no matter what no matter the circumstance no matter the condition no matter how bad it looks even now Lord I want to say is to you that the circumstances couldn't have really gotten any worse for Mary Martha they don't went through every emotion that you can imagine that brother had died they had been a friend to Jesus which they thought was the Messiah here with me they went through the emotions here G here last source died they go through emotion of him not to me this is everyday life right here this is a scripture for everyday life they're going through the emotions the funerals past the circumstance can't get no worse than else the condition can't get no worse than this the burial had passed the ceiling of the tomb has passed and four days they had if they had had four days of grieving but even though they had went through the emotions when they seen Jesus coming down the road Martha Anna and said even now Lord Oh hallelujah I would ask you today no matter what your situation and no matter the condition your face and can you say even our Lord even now boy yes I'm facing a time but even now Lord yes I'm facing things as a Christian that I never faced before but even now Lord there's a people that believe that even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we're not gonna fear any evil whew why God's with me notice the channel of faith that she had dropped into she allowed all the inlets and the outlets of her spirit ramp to be controlled by faith it allowed her conscience or reasoning or imagination or members her affection to be controlled by faith whoo there's a whole lot of things right there could be preached right here but she allowed all of those things to be controlled by faith you see a lot of times you allow your emotions to get the better of you and you don't allow faith to go in operation but if you can let loose or your emotions one time look past your fear look past your reasonings yeah it looks like Oh hope is gone look past it let your faith operate you see the reason why Satan wants to keep you quiet as he don't want you speaking because when you go to Amen in the word and when you go to speak in the word saying what the word says there is coming out of your mouth come on somebody hey word of power that will with the devil anytime anyplace under any situation but we will not allow we will not allow the enemy to stick a sock in our mouth and shut us up we've been quite too low now's the time to let the word loose it's a time to let faith speak for the impossibilities made your situation named your Mountain give it a good name and watch as it begins to fall [Applause] hallelujah the life walk down there champion but he never walked away they drug him out of there the life has come into our camp but he's not walking away hallelujah Satan is going to regret the day that he pointed the sword at this David Hale is going to regret the day that it pointed the sword at Full Gospel lighthouse what you're getting ready to see in the natural you're gonna watch in the spiritual hallelujah and it's going to give faith to a people to believe for the miraculous woo brother Alden sent me in this morning I told him I'm using that tonight he sent me a quote brother Branham said if someone was telling me I believe it was my brother back here telling a story about a man her minister and some only her of his congregation he said he'd go off the log he said pastor Shore the Lord's with you he said I can pack a log across my back when I go across shoulder the Lord's with you and he went and done it he said I can pack a log in a wheelbarrow cross at the same time sure pastor the Lord's with you your faith can do anything he said I can put you in the wheelbarrow and pack it all he said now wait a minute that's different when you're including it yourself you see it's mighty good for us to say Amen it's mighty good for us to say I believe that true oh I know I know I just brought you out a little limb with me I just made you believe in the Impossibles but when you're getting the wheelbarrow with me you can shout with me you can say a man with me you can preach with me but when I asked you to get in the wheelbarrow of faith and tell you that I can pack you're saying across are you willing to get in the wheelbarrow with me are you willing you're not getting in the wheelbarrow of me you're getting in the wheelbarrow with Jesus he's never lost one of this hi we're off that side he'll take you through he's got some problems he's got your sickness there's nothing too hard for the Lord all right well people that aren't afraid to put it in action we ain't afraid to get in the wheelbarrow this message whew I know some of us is like a wheelbarrow we ain't no good until somebody gets behind us and pushes us but even so Lord Jesus I don't care how you got to get me a cross just give me a cross I don't care if you got to pack me a cross I don't care if I'm weak and I can't get across if you can pack me across give me a cross some of you may be stronger than I am and you might have to lift me up every once in a while but even so no matter what it takes we're the bride of Jesus Christ this is not one man this is about a body brother Adam said it makes a few comments on untapped resources I'll just make a few comments on these but the tree of life has no end to it is that we got untapped resources and you're scared to step out and take God at His Word again he says and here you him all things are possible to them that believe we've got the untapped resources of God at our hands too display God untapped resources to display God whoo right at our hands hallelujah we are sons and daughters of God when god made man he made him a god swallow it swallow it it'll help you he made him a god he give him a dominion over the earth but his fall in a state drop that but what they lost by Adam it was restored by Christ he said if you say Oh mice is more than just a scripture right here he says you put it on your lips he said if you say look at your neighbor's say if you say God's with us and we're going to see miracles if you say if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said shall come to pass you can have what you said all things whatsoever you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it he restored to us all that was lost in Adam come on church you got untapped resources you got resources that you ain't even reached even got a hold of but don't leave them untapped tonight reach in there and say like David said in Psalms 103 bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all of his benefits who forgiveth all of our iniquities all of them who healeth all of our diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who grounded thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies who satisfies thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagles whoo forget not all of his benefits when you wake up tomorrow morning you start your day for getting out all his benefits come on somebody you go to the grocery store maybe on Friday nights and have a little date time what are you doing you're stockpiling your fridge refrigerator you stockpile in your freezer so you got something to eat all the way through the week all right now I want you to open up your spiritual refrigerator and I want you to get all the benefits all these resources open it up there's gonna come things as we can you gonna need you're gonna need overcoming power you're gonna need perfect faith you're gonna need a man that can turn on the light oh come on somebody you're gonna need a paradox you're gonna need more than a man open it up and as Jesus come on here Isaiah 40 and 29 he giveth power to the faint unto them that have no mighty increases strength even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall when I woke up early this morning and I begin to seek God and ask God and find God and look for God I come across this scripture right here I read this thing by thousands of times but this morning after our pastor had preached on the expectation a spark of expectation I have myself a good old gasoline blowing up on the inside of my living room but they that wait upon the Lord if you go to looking up that word wait but they that expect from the Lord who you ain't expecting this from down earth the gasoline pump you're in expecting this from the doctor you ain't expecting this from the lawyer you ain't expecting this from the banker you're expecting this from God but they expect from the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as Eagles they shall run they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint he told us to walk through the land possess the land inhabit the land you go walk through it and when you're starting to get faint he's gonna renew your strength and you're gonna keep on walking whew if you walked out of the grave I'm a walking - I'm sitting down Daniel 11 and 32 that the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits the people that do know their God shall be weak and do nothing come on somebody if you know who your God is and you know who you've been birthed by who will be strong and you will do unexplainable things you will do extreme things expect sports this is a people that do know their God who the center people who do not understand God but a people that know in whom they have belief a people that understand the God of heaven is fighting their battles his the people and know that they are not weak in faith these are the people that's not pushed around by the enemy when he sticks up his scarecrows around this message that ain't scaring you because you ain't no crow hallelujah I'm an eagle I was born free but this is a people that do know their God they're not worshiping him in the name of titles this is the people that do not believe in the Trinity but they realize that God displayed himself in Father Son and Holy Ghost they don't think God is three they know God that God is displaying himself and attributes of Father Son and Holy Ghost and now he is displaying himself in a body this is a people that realize that their packing on the inside of their soul Almighty God and only inside of them there's enough power to go out and create a new world wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute you're talking about somebody else besides me no I'm talking about you I'm calling your name tonight that you have the ability by the power of the spoken word to speak conditions out of existence this is what he's brought us to speaking conditions there are people that do know their God and you will be song and you will do exploits who could your neighbor say get ready we will do exploits this is the people that's been baptized in his name that's been called by his name that speak in his name that live in his name that sing in his name that dance in his name that realized there is no help but from God they realize that he's the God that restores our health they realize that this God is a God that gives us our money he's the God that feeds our souls moving right on long as he will praise the Lord anyhow now when God spoke to Moses from a burning bush and Moses went down to Egypt to take over what a sight the Prophet said that when Moses got down there he showed the phenomena because he was God's voice how could a man pick up dust and throw it and say thus saith the Lord not a flea in the country in a couple of hours from me and everything sprouted full of fleas not a fly nowhere at all and he'd say let there be flies and the first thing you know a big old blow fly begin to fly around and there they were bloating the people everywhere what man could do that it was God using that prophet making his word a sign to give a call that were not staying here in Egypt we're going out of Egypt whoo hallelujah but he didn't just send his voice to take them out of Egypt he sent his voice his voice was said to come out of and to go into you coming out of the cosmos and you're being birthed into a new world oh come on somebody brother Barnum said in 1965 that we are at another Ephesians we are coming out of this world and going into that world we have come out we have been separators we've been not particulars but they're unclean things we separate herself from the friends of the world Moses when it come down to the Red Sea the Red Sea was in his way and God said speak to the sea what's in your way they st. Capital Warren what's in your wallet but what's in your way what's in your way you got things that are standing in front of you if it's a sickness that is trying to destroy your pastor it's in your way speak to that sickness in the name of Jesus and you watch that demon fall watch that demon run for cover I'm talking about a people that's not afraid to speak the word it was in his way and he was able to speak to that sea and the sea had to stand at attention as the children of this will walked over because greater was he that was in Moses than he that was in the sea Oh hallelujah and that same God is with us tonight but he's not only with us but he's in us he's proved he was in us because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world what are you afraid of tonight I'm afraid of Jericho why you got to be afraid God said he'd give it to you there's Giants in that land don't you bring back some negative report be a Caleb be a Joshua back a positive report there's enough grates in this message that'll feed everybody come on somebody if it took two men to carry that guy those grapes back what about this message this is not upon the shoulders of some man this is on the basis of the I am you remember those rain grouse and brother Bynum was out there and he's hunting and he said in there and he said I started walking he said I started walking he said there was no Sun out there nowhere he said it was cloudy and there was three rainbows and he said I just begin to walk and something said that's far enough he said Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new which was confirming my message of him this was not a message of William Branham this was a message of him Christ Oh hallelujah Christ didn't die Christ didn't die when Jesus was hanging on the tree Fanfan your neighbor they'll be okay wake him up Christ did not die when Jesus was hanging on the tree and he said it is finished Christ did not die because Christ is the Anointed One Christ come on somebody you can't kill God Oh bye old man called Jesus felt so much of you and I that it took upon you the sin of the whole world and buried down all the way into a devil's hail and he made a delivery and when he dropped off your sin inhale because you ain't got to go there brother William he's already made away and when he got down there and dropped off a delivery of your sins he walked down to the devil and he kicked the door in he said oh I've been waiting on you to get here for a mighty long time I thought I had you in a hat Daniel I thought I had you when I had Elijah I thought I had you when I had this one I thought I had you when I had Joseph but finally you're here I am the Virgin born son of God and I have come down to take over who and he wretch over there and grab the keys off of the death off Alleluia I can imagine Jesus giving him a good old kick and he shut the door to hail so that you don't have to go there and when he rose up early on Sunday morning he had the keys in his hand of death hell and the grave the Anointed One never died Alleluia Christ never died let me tell you this you can go to the tomb you can go to the grave you can die just like Lazarus knock one of these mornings if you pack it on the inside of you Almighty God and you have expressed the gene seat of Almighty God one of these mornings one of these mornings one of these mornings one of these mornings it's going to be us that are alive and remain but you're going to rise first if you go by the way of the grave you will rise first don't you be discouraged if your loved ones gone by the way of the grave they're the ones gonna rise first they're the ones you're gonna watch come walking up your sidewalks and you don't be afraid you let them on in it's a proof to you that it'll give you faith for a rapture like never before give him praise in the house of God that same God still speaking that same God still living you ain't gotta fight it it's finished [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's he that speak it's the one who said he'd never leave you and then never forsake you it's the one that cannot fail the one that cannot lie he said he'd be with even any TV in the world if he did it for one he's got to do it for you he's still speaking and looking to the unseen I hope you're getting this tonight this is bigger than me faith in God brother Ram said have faith in God don't doubt we don't see all things but we see Jesus he says now which is that old fella here that that held up his hand a while ago that wanted to be saved right here in the wheelchair he believe God knows you brother I don't know you you got a prayer card it hold it all right you believe God can tell me what's your trouble if he would would you believe he wants to heal you you're saddled for death it's a cancer in the lung would you believe that God will make you well you do then if I was in your place you know what I do there was some lepers at senator gate one time and they said well I said we're here to die let's get up and do something about it if we sit here with the Hoff we go in the city they're dying in there so we haven't got no choice if we go down to the camp they might spare us you're going to die in that condition sitting in that wheelchair Jesus Christ is your only hope that's right so why don't you rise up from there and take your chair and go home and be well in the name of Jesus Christ do you believe every one of you then stand to your feet I don't care what's wrong with you stand up on your feet and believe God all that wants to receive Christ at this time raise up

if we're going to see miracles we gotta pray like never before we got to believe like never before we gotta ask like never before don't don't you ever dare to ask something too small for God you are talking to God and I'm gonna give you some sound doctrine here I'm gonna give you some things that's gonna comfort you because you're gonna walk out of this atmosphere and you're gonna go right back in the layout of cell and somebody its prior gonna flick you the bird you're gonna leave heavenly places and you're gonna go right back to Laodicea believe me it happens I left one time after I got no bridge to the meeting and I thought I was gonna be raptured soon as I pulled out on the freeway lord have mercy that man talked about my mama for a long time it makes you realize that these are still temporal bodies but listen to this is it miracles may take place on a platform and a few days later than maybe the enemy come in he said but look if you've got not brother Branham but if you've got thus saith the Lord just let the storms how the devil can't beat you around on thus saith the Lord you see if all you gather from this meeting tonight is emotion and going through another service if you just gather those things the devil can beat you around on that but if you can take what Jesus had that if your bother me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be given unto you the devil can't beat you around on that because they ain't saw word that's God's Word God's still got a voice and your voice is his voice deities not in heaven but deity is in you and I when God speaks he gives strength when God speaks it's forever settled in heaven when God speaks to you you do what he tells you when God speaks all hell moves that's everything can't stand in his presence there was that voice that changed my life it was how voice that set my course it was that voice and maybe a new creature I was in a car this past Friday there's a stirring I felt the turn-on on a great warrior Joshua just felt something pulsating me to move and look in that direction and I hadn't been in a car by myself maybe about 10 minutes if a cop would've got behind me probably would've pulled me over I hadn't been listening to that message maybe five ten minutes and all of a sudden the Holy Ghost begin to flood that car I hear the prophets say now look if my spirit was as my shadow as a shadow of the material say my shadow would be the spirit of the material in the body supernaturally now the body of the Lord Jesus is a shadow as it was of the natural physical body of the Lord and notice if healings if power-efficient if the things that Christ had in him has gone out of his shadow which you are then Christ is paralyzed if healings if powers visions if these things that Christ had in him has gone out of his shadow in crisis you see that's where the church world has tried to push it off that these things are days gone by but notice he says his natural body sits paralyzed because that if his physical body moves his shadow will have to move with it if we are in Christ by the Holy Ghost baptism and the way that the body of Christ moves it will move the same way on earth for this is a shadow of his body a man always been in figurative types and and it is tonight the body of the Lord Jesus Christ now notice now taking it out of the things of the world the body predestinated by God cold of God elected by God chosen of God saved by God baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Spirit and made members of this body now I want you to know what titles he gives to the body or live ready and willing come on somebody you are not a people that are paralyzing Christ but you are people that's on your feet that's walking to the beat of the sheet music your sounded and out your becoming on the word you are the written pistils read of all men come on somebody you're alive you're alive ready and willing my shadow will move every time anything my body moves and the Holy Spirit body of Christ will move just as Christ moves and if Christ in heaven can ever get a spiritual body on earth moving as he wants you to move watch watch for things to happen it's become it's beginning to come to life they've paralyzed it long enough but the Holy Spirit is bringing it to life bringing life into it and it's beginning to wake up and beginning to move and because it sees its position these problems can live again prophesy thou son of man and I've heard a noise and a rattling and those bones come together you are the people of the book hallelujah prophesy that son of man these things are for you [Applause] now we got last week in The Devil's trying to push us in a corner us push him in a corner let's push him in a corner let's push him so much in a corner that he runs out of brother John's corner and runs out them back doors as fast as he came in he welcome here anyway he might as well leave but he shows up time and time again he's a stupid devil that likes getting his teeth knocked out let's give it to him or more time we are moved by the spirit if healings if power of visits we're in Jesus you can't separate it and if Christ had rights you got rights if Christ had power you got power if Christ had visions who got missions take the book eat the book become the book speak the book prophesy again Brian it's your duty to say what the word says stop letting the devil beat you all right hang on what you've been told over and over and over again start doing it there it goes here he goes that was one person and pushed him out what about you how about somebody said I'm not willing to live with him anymore I'm not willing to put up with him anymore there's a people that's so completely yielded to him that they know what he wants done with the word this bride has so much power that she can save house a he'll give way in the name of Jesus Christ it's God using mortal hips again and when she says house a he'll give way in the name of Jesus Christ you know what happens Hale has to give way in the name of Jesus he'll ain't sitting there but when you speak those things in the name of Jesus Christ house a he'll give way in the name of Jesus Christ how in the world can Hale hold what God is loosed you're a free people tonight look as a neighbor say I'm free I'm free from fear I'm free from chains I'm free from drugs I'm free from alcohol I'm free from pornography I'm free from pills I'm free from my own self I'm free from complexes I'm free from sickness I'm free from dogmas I'm free from Creed's I'm free from stigma I'm free from myself I'm free from my past I'm free from every devil that tried to destroy me in my only years but God was for me and if God is for me who can be against me hallelujah we're not paralyzing Christ we're letting them loose I'm free I'm free I'm free I pray I pray hello yeah hello yeah walk out of it stop walking into prison bars walk out of it they open a dollar but Jim I'm telling you right now that God is for you Satan swore they destroy our families Satan swore that it is so else how can you bind up what God has already loose before the foundation of the world the only thing that is keeping you bound is when you accept the devil's bluff every believer in him tonight is likewise possessed so possessed so completely given over till his words become like the words of Christ Psalms 46 and five God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that writerly the heathen raised the kingdom's were moved he uttered his voice the earth melted the Lord of Hosts is with us somebody say the Lord of Hosts is with us the God of Jacob is our refuge the Lord of Hosts is with us you see Satan has to recognize you is because he has encountered you before he countered you when you whipped him when you walked into that fire with Daniel when you walked into that fire with Shadrach Meshach and Abednego you whipped him them you're identified in Christ you were identified there come on somebody you whipped him when you whipped him and Joseph and when you when you were in him in Christ when he climbed up Calvary's Hill you whipped him there Satan has to recognize you because he's encountered the one that's living on the inside of you before and year of God little children and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world oh that was in crisis in me every power every anointing every miracle that was in crisis in me this ain't a time to be quiet it's a time to speak it's a time to go forward when they're well tell me when word was there every time at sound of this time when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time now this ministry is joining him and it's church together this is your day this is your hour this is your moment this is your message this is your pillar fire this is your prophet this is all Jesus God of hosts is in her he's in the midst of her what's in God's in me I'm a side church with my side power with massage signs 1960 adoption now this way does choke you to death but did you know that men that are sons of God are a mature God's how many ever know that how many knows that Jesus said so that the Bible Jesus said did not your law say it itself that ye are God's and if you call them God's what's God said in Genesis 2 that they were God's because they have full domain over the Dominion of the world he give him dominion over all things and he lost his sonship he lost his God ship he lost his sonship he lost his domain and Satan took it over but brother we are waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out hallelujah and we'll take every power that Satan's got away from him yes sir it belongs to him this is the hour when the power of God will walk out and take every power of Satan away from him I have just read to you the greatest quote that you'll hear all year if you can put this into action doing the power of God we'll walk out and throw the power of Satan away we're not waiting for it we're here we've arrived now are we sons of God he swore by himself we're waiting for a time and here we are we're at the top of the pyramid were at the last stage and we are here walking out and taking every power away from Satan away from him now Satan is a deceiver and don't you ever underestimate him because he slick and he smooth he'll sleeping in such a way that you won't even recognize him but I want you to realize that legally Satan has no power he has no power because all of his power was stripped away from him that day on Calvary oh if you could just go back and listen to that day on Calvary it'll set your soul flying but if you can realize that all his power is is bluffing Satan has no power only as he can Bluff with it if he can Bluff you into it all right you'll have to have it ain't that a bad deal that he has no power but all the power that he has is just a bluff it's just a lot he's calling your handle and the only power that Satan has is to get you to believe his life you see why Satan is scared of you because we have the answer to the devil's question we are as sons of God right now now I know it'd be pretty amazing to watch this tonight if you could watch it in that but this is a spiritual battle but if you could watch this literally take place if you could watch sister Brenda Klein come up here and we got a ten-foot 10-foot time that's standing in front of us maybe I don't know sister Brenda like I do but I know when it comes down to it sister Brenda is a fighter there's a whole lot of fighters have been here y'all heard y'all didn't hear that on the internet but there's a mmm-hmm we know who we are and we ain't scared got a little bit of attitude with it you imagine this was put a ten-foot man up here and all of his strength and all of his power and sister Brenda comes up here and grabs ahold of him and takes all of his strength and all of his power and throws it in the flask we tried the trash can man that would be awesome I'm telling you right now pay good money to watch a 10-foot man be defeated by a little little lady like sister Brenda just calm and collected I pay good money to watch that but you know I come here every Saturday and Sunday night and I don't have to pay good money to watch it but I watch sons and daughters of God walk up to a 10 foot child and take all of his power away from him and remind him who he is that he is a tool in God's hand and he can't touch one hair of my head unless God gives him privilege and anointing and allows him to do it there's a people I said not today Satan she's on her feet so I'm motel in order maybe she sat down and I won't call her name but there was a little lady here she's she's one of mine she's just one of my favorites he's just a wonderful young lady I see it was working at a job and ever since there was this customer that came in and give her some attitude and just told her what she was gonna do and what she was gonna do after she got off of work what house she was going to call and report her and everything else and she told her she was gonna whoop her she told her she's gonna whoop her and this little lady said hmm we'll see about that you see she knew she knew she knew who she was and she wasn't afraid of the bat oh if you can look at safety when he comes and he tells him that he's gonna rob you of your pasture then it's gonna rob you of your church that he's gonna rob you of your health rob you of your strength robbed you of your wife rob you of your children robbed you of this robbed you of that you can look at him say Ruth we'll see about that we'll see about that Satan we're not backing up we're not giving up we'll see about that we're calling your bluff back up Satan you're an offense to me hallelujah we'll see about that he said he's gonna destroy Ron Spencer we'll see about that he said is going to restore this church we'll see about that who's gonna stand against this Goliath we as sons and daughters of God we come against him in the name of Jesus Satan you're a defeated foe we'll see about that this is life you got a right as a son you got a right as a daughter they put this here for me I better take a sip of it they might they may not give it out to me every weekend thank you brother Matthew I enjoy Jesus I was sitting I was listening I'm closing musicians can come I'm sitting and I was listening brother Tim service today 7:00 a.m. I study I was going over these things both Tim's I don't choir came up and they started singing a song it started singing a song the tears that my name is written down in heaven and it's a mine you see that name was put there before the foundation of the world on the Lamb's Book of Life he started singing that song you could just feel as their anointing was coming down just listening to it and his presence was drawing near and they come down to the end of that song and sister Elena butts she began to take off running she began to take off her honey this was a this was a daughter of God that Satan that swore that he would destroy with lung cancer Oh hallelujah when she realized that name was put there before the foundation of the world and something rose up in her and she took over on and through the congregation you see she was rolling and dancing from a body that had been freed she was running and dancing from a body that Satan swore that he would destroy that Satan had put his hands on God's property but there was a minister that said Satan take your hands off a God's property she had a right to run see on the right to dance I say there you Church of the Living God Satan has to take his hand over God's property he cannot legally have Ron Spencer Ron Spencer in here tonight but if I were you I'd dance for Ron Spencer I'd run for Dawn Spencer Satan take your dirty hands off the God's property we're running from free bodies that shake and swore that he destroy we got it right we got it right thanks our on and not thanks if you can never realize that the immortal one lives on hints out of you sin can't win Satan can't win hell can't win cancer can't win depressing can't win anxiety can't win if you ever realize who you are and you start talking today you start talking to Satan not tomorrow but today right now he's got to come down to a time when you're not afraid and you're not ashamed to let it loose from where you're standing that no matter where your ass no matter if your friends are a hell no matter if your colleagues are around just stop speaking it into the atmosphere say Satan you can't have my gallbladder you can't have my body you can't have my strength if you ever move into a spot head to a channel and you allow the mighty Conqueror to come in that channel and you allow to start speaking those Saints he didn't say if I say them but if you saying if you could ever move into that realm of the supernatural and you start speaking these things and you realize her position that you've got a right to say these things you've got a right to pray these things you've got a right to worse the government's trying to take our gun rights from them but they'll never take our god-given rights from us Satanists Ratner robbed you time and time again but he can't rob what God is given I know some of you afraid I know some of you afraid to even ask I know some of you are afraid to even let it come out of your lips because you're afraid it's going to be wrong you're afraid that you're going to get let down who's going to let you down God ain't gonna let you down god I never let me down come on somebody if anybody says if anybody's ever believed if any church has ever seen miracles it's this church so why are you afraid to let it come across the lips Satan ain't nothing but allowed Satan toads he didn't have no right to dance he told she didn't have no right to sing he told you had no right to worship why start listening to the devil now we ain't listening to him from the beginning why should we listen to him now hellooo you you're his victory let it come across her lips huh need healing on my hands I need healing my family I need healing in my past I need healing I need healing all right let's ask for it and let's watch it come to pass I'm asking you to believe like never before I'm asking you to act as if you are in your last moments and you're asking you're asking for things that only you could ask for because you know the need this God is with us it's goddess for us it's God as in us I don't remember the date but a few months ago a few months ago I asked I asked a certain young man the name of brother Seth to come down to the air to this podium and to give you faith and to give you a an expectation to believe like never before I speak these things so they don't charge you to say things and ask for things that you don't see that you can see things that you can't understand things that you don't know how they'll come to pass I'm asking you to ask it's easy for somebody to ask it's easy for somebody to ask when they know it's right there when they can see it coming but when you can't see it coming can you still ask I brought brother Seth up here and I begin to speak to him in his spirit realm and I started speaking to him brother Seth had been battling with things in his stomach things kidney stones and the doctors had told him that there were things in his lungs they told him that there was things in his lungs I brought brother Seth down here and I told him I said brother Seth do you believe me he said I absolutely do brother answer oh I believe you I said well I'm telling you right now that hanging between you and I is a light and if you ask Todd will give it to you and on that next Wednesday's the doctors called back and they said there's nothing in his lungs why because the son was not afraid to ask [Music] [Applause] let your faith loose let your face loose let your faith look will you believe like never before go to praising God for the things he's going to give you for the things that you can't see for the things that are impossible for the things that are a paradox for the things you can't understand for the things that you would hold you don't even know how to even ask but I'll allow the Holy Spirit to make intercession for your groanings you're not backing up you're not giving up you're standing on your feet you know who you are now start speaking for the yarn unwound in the unseen or helm and allow God to bring those things that you can't see into visibility ask him in the name of Jesus and watch them come to pass Oh hallelujah father we call upon you the God of heaven we invoke you tonight and declare and decree that there is none like you that there's none besides you you are Almighty God and if that same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead if it dwells on the inside of us it'll quicken our mortal bodies I pray that as we begin to speak these things into the atmosphere that would watch them may manifest we are going to watch the miracle match ourselves were sounding them out in the name of Jesus were receiving them in the name of Jesus [Music] Satan you're nothing but a buff you're alive you're defeated you're a loser you're a deceiver you take your hands off a God's property we believe more than God the dog what is
