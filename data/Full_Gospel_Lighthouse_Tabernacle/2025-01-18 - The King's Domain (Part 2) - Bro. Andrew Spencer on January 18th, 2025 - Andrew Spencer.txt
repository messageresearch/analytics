everything he's My All In All now he changed my whole life gave gave me a testimony gave me something uh some Solid Rock to stand on you know what he's done for me he'll do for you you know I know I I just tell you right up front my buddies they used a nickname and they call me story time Tommy I can make a short story long but I'm crunch for time so I'm going to do the best I can you know I want to kick it off with just telling you I was extrem and over the top of everything I did you know I grew up in a broken home and and and a lot of things that kids shouldn't have seen as I was growing up going through the party lifestyle and everything and as I progressed getting older and older you know I I love Sports Extreme Sports football played did everything I could do to have a good time you know and as I I progressively got older and got more into drugs myself and and doing my own thing and uh uh by the time I was you know I had a fighting Spirit too and by the time I was a senior in high school I got into it with the principal and wound up quitting school I wound up working at a restaurant I drunk driver ran through the building at Arby's and knocked the grease friers all over me and I had third degree burns all down my back and and my arms and my face and everything and I was in a hospital like a month and and by God's grace he kept me alive you know I didn't even know the Lord as my Lord and Savior and and and you know at that time I thought money was going to buy my happiness you know I had a buddy I throw in here I had a buddy of mine I was riding around with him he had got hurt and got some money and I said Lord I told my buddy I said I wish I could get hurt and get some money like you and it was the next day when I got burn burn so just throw it in there be careful what you wish for you know uh and uh you know I I I thought all this time that money was going to buy me happiness you know and you know come to find out later on in life that it was just an empty void that God put in us that you know I was longing to feel and you know as I got I got a little bit of money and all I did was just get worse at doing what I was doing you know but uh make a long story short you know I wound up having a bad motorcycle wreck almost died and uh uh wound up uh after after I got healed up I was like man I need to go back to church and uh uh I ended up getting invited to church too and uh it's the first time I've been in church in a long time and when I was there God started speaking to my heart and you know I ended up just kind of uh fighting it and going trying to uh run from the presence of God and I got going down the road and then just uh a still Small Voice told me I was walking away from God and I turned my truck around went back and I I just had conviction all over me I wound up uh uh finding that preacher and uh he led me to the Lord and and you know God put an anchor in my heart there I I didn't I didn't serve the Lord very long I you know I I encourage all you kids to get in Fellowship find fellowship with like Faith with some Believers you know get in and have some fun find you know we love to have fun as human beings you know find something fun to do and get get some good Fellowship but you know I didn't have it and you know like I said I I was grew up in a broken home I didn't have nobody to go to church or nothing and uh and uh uh I started backsliding you know obviously like two weeks later and I started running backwards you know I wound up uh having a motorcycle wre like I said I got to C for the horse there and uh but needless to say uh uh after I about died man the Lord uh uh I end up going to church and that's when I end up uh seeing my wife and and I end up uh wind up going out with her and wind up getting married and having some kids this is why I'm saying man I'm trying to rush my stories and I'm a little bit nervous and if it wasn't for the grace of God I I I never could have speak in p you know but uh now I just want to be a living representation of his power and demonstration of what he can do in our lives you know if I could just overcome my nerves a little bit but but uh you know uh uh you know God anyway God God placed an anchor down in my heart even though I started running backwards going the wrong way there was something in me and I can look back now and see that was that white dog black dog fight you know you know before I was just doing my thing living my life and you know I you know I love getting high and doing the things I did but you know when God come and turned my life around I was never the same you know now I had a battle in my life now now it was a constant war of me trying to be that old man that I didn't want to be that old man but you know I I did what I did not want to do you know like Paul you know so I felt I found myself in a in a bad situation there but uh after I got married and uh you know now my responsibilities are uh adding up I got a now we had a son and you know I began to use meth regularly I I was self-employed I did construction and and and I I drank all I woke up in the morning drinking beer before I left and by lunchtime I'd have a six-pack in me a lot of times and that was just just the way I Liv no matter where I went that's what I did I was drunk and hiding no matter what I was doing and uh as I I became more jealous and and more controlling over my wife and my wife she has a powerful testimony all the things I put her through you know but you know I I was running from God and I wound up getting in a highe speed Pursuit and uh W Up Wrecking out and then getting in all kinds of trouble and everything but you know God God knew what I needed and and as I end up getting laid up there in the hospital I mean laid up there in the uh in the jail you know I was mad at God CU I I told God I said there was anytime anytime you could have stepped in and done something all I wanted to be was a good husband and a good dad and he told me uh now you have nobody else to blame now you're blaming me and I said I'm sorry God it's all my fault and I woke up the next morning and I I open the Bible and it said my grace is sufficient for thee therefore my strength is made perfect in weakness and I opened the Bible again I flipped it again I just needing something from God and said there's no fear in love for perfect love cast out fear and by God's grace he delivered me there right there uh 12 years of drug and alcohol abuse he delivered me of all my jealousy and all my temper and uh Set Me Free and I end up getting out and I and after I got out of jail God give me the Deliverance you know and I had to go through a drug court program and go through all these things and I was jumping through the hoops and doing what I had to do you know and I know I know where my life was going death hell of the Grave dope The Dope Game I live death or prison prison eventually you know I got I got a brother in prison right now I got a sister committed suicide a couple years ago and uh you know so I know where I was going that was just the lifestyle I lived and and you know it's about seven years after that I was sitting in church and you know you know the Bible talks about when the Holy Ghost when he yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell I'm sitting there in church and and God was speaking in my heart and he the song was Mercy rewrote my life and uh and God started speaking to me and he said why don't you quit smoking today I said I can't quit smoking today I'm going to Papa everybody in my family smokes he said why don't you hang out with like faith I said I will and instantly 19 years of smoking he delivered me and set me free God's so awesome he he broke all my chains and set me free but then I hit a spot in life that I say you know I got to where I was just uh uh half-hazard Le Christian Living a Christian Life going through the motions no real Victory you know I might go I'm going to say you know I'd make times my life I'm going to give God 30 minutes of my day you know I'm going to go read my Bible 30 minutes but I might have scrolled Instagram or YouTube like two hours before I got there so I wasn't really getting nothing you know what I'm saying and so then uh so God God you know he was getting me in a spot there that I you know you still just kind of going through the motions man that ain't no way to live you know huh and now that I know blessed be the name of the Lord who Christ sets free is free indeed uh it's a peace that passes understanding and joy unspeakable and full of Glory blessed be his name glory to God anyway so so it's just praise moment there blessed be the name of the Lord woo Glory so anyway who's free yeah Jesus all right and you know I was on the way up here I was like man I hope they don't ask me to pray man I just hope they don't ask me to pray and then Ron's like why don't you get up and share a testimony I'm like Lord come on you got a sense of humor huh all right I'm going to throw a funny one in here for y'all so I was this bad motorcycle guy you know I thought I was tougher than Nails you know what I'm saying and when I was in drug court you know I was a nice guy then my wife she probably laughing right now she told me give her a shout out and then she said no she gonna kill me if I do so shout out to Tammy so I'm in drug court and I'm going through this and she used to have to take me all these meetings and everything and I'm I'm like you know uh I want up give me a mop pad you know I thought man I got me some Independence again I was pumped you know I got this mop pad you know riding around and I'm getting out of class this guy needed a ride and I just offer I just trying to give him an empty gesture you know I'm like I mean I can give you a ride if you need oh yeah yeah yeah I'm like come on man this guy now I'm riding through town here on the moped coming up through this dude on the back and I'm like man but anyway yeah I thought that was funny everybody else get the kick out of that one but you know so I was going through the motions anyway of living a halfhazard Christian Life and uh you know sometimes God lay us you know the prophet T us sometimes God lay us on our back and look up and see where our great blessings come from and uh uh I had a um a main artery rupture on me and uh another funny one when I was down there in the basement I was going through it and man I was my back was I mean I had to excruciate in pain my wife was tripping and you know I was crying but I wasn't crying but just tears were coming out and uh and she she was like no we're going to hospital I'm like nah she was like yeah I said what you think the Cowboys did I said they cowboyed up she said no they died she walked out there and I I got think I'm like maybe she's right I'm like all right all right we'll go to the hospital so I end up going to hospital anyway so nless say it was more serious than I thought and they LIF flighted me and uh uh they LIF flighted me and uh uh I was in the hospital and everything they end up and this is where my life changed you know they end up I ain't never seen so many doctors in my life even after I got burned you know and everything uh here they all come in there and tell me how Mr Rich me your high priority here today and uh they're prepping me for Hope and art surgery and all this and everything and you know we got prayer warriors around the world praying for me and stuff and and they end up coming in there and uh we had to run another test and they came back and said it was type B and he come in there and starts telling me that there won't be no surgery you know he said but he asked me what I did I Tau him construction and stuff and he said well you won't be doing that no more you going to have to change your occupation and he asked me what I did for fun won't be doing none of that no more and you know so I was pretty overwhelmed with you know not going to be do he said I won't even be able to lift like five pounds and I'm like dude I said I said why don't why don't we go in there and fix it then or I said I said how long's a it take for a to a or the Dissection the heel he said a or the tear is always a tear it won't ever heal and he and I said well then why don't we go in there and fix it and he said because the type B that I have was more gastral it was more complicated of surgery the risk of me dying during surgery uh the odds was so high that they would just keep me on aggressive medication the rest of my life and so they had me on all this medication and everything and it suppressed my adrenaline glands and suppressed me all the way down that way I didn't have no you know any adrenaline or anything man and uh and so what you trying to mess with me and uh and so uh all right then yeah come on go ahead uh so you make me lose my train of thought man oh man uh yeah oh yeah so it made me lose all my adrenaline and everything that suck man you know everything you do man you I love always love to drin I love I was dren and junkie but now now uh anyway so at this time when he's telling me all this and I I'm start getting Plum depressed man because you know you can probably tell I'm a little bit energetic kind of guy now my whole life's changed and I'm like I'm thinking man I'm even thinking this time I'm like I'm not even going to be able to cut wood and split wood for my family and burn heat you know I'm thinking oh this what a burden I'm going to be and I actually got into a really dark spot I started getting real just in this depression just staring at the wall and I'm like I might as well get out here and end it and and I didn't want no visitors I told my wife I didn't want nobody and my end up uh I end up calling my buddy my buddy that wound up leading me to the message and uh I'm talking to him and he was like he said well you got to look God's word he said you got to look it was a miracle you didn't have to have surgery and it was a miracle that you didn't die on the way to the hospital and by the way it's like 75 85% die on the way of the hospital with what I had and and uh uh he said and God's word says by my stripes you're healed and it was like a it was like a little voice of something I'd be healed and it was like I said Jesus turn the lights on for me gave me some hope instead of wanting to get out of here and end it it gave me a little bit of Hope and a little bit of inspiration you know I started wearing a little prayer croth and started believing and started professing and and started walking on down the road and and uh I had another doctor come in there on his lunch break and he was sitting there talking to me about El hunting and stuff and he was like he's like man he asked me about sleep at me if I ever been tested I said and all they was looking at all my oxygen levels I was dropping down to like 80s my heart rate was like 38 it was dropping way down there and everything he was like yeah he said you need to be getting checked out so here I am it's about two weeks at home I'm sitting at home I know I'm trying to speed up now I know I've been D running on but I'm sitting at home about two weeks later I'm sitting there at the uh sitting there eating uh soup at my table there and I'm sitting there I'm like man I guess I need to get checked out for sleep apne and the Lord spoke to my heart and said will you believe the same God healed your aord could heal you that and I said I do and instantly God God God touched my life and I quit having all the issues that I was having with asleep apnea at night so God healed me asleep apnea and then he started dealing with me on a a justification and sanctification and he started seeing me because I made him some promises when I was laid up in in the hospital and by God's grace he he showed me my sanctification process then he filled me with the Holy Ghost and and he put me in power for service and you know get me up here and talk when I could never talk you know so by God's grace here we are power and demonstration uh so God started elevating my faith and building up my faith like David and Goliath so that was just a start of it you know and then brother Ron calls me out out there you know and uh y'all will probably see all that on the testimony but brother Ry calls me out and God was using them things to inspire my faith you know and then I had uh I had a bush hog fall on my foot it was like a 3600 lb bush hog fell on my foot and Cav my foot in and me and my father-in-law barely got it off I think an angel lifted it up and when I looked down my foot and was all caved in I'm like oh my goodness that peace came over me I stood up and I said Paul Shook at serpent off said no deadly thing going to harm him and I walked it off my my father and I HT his back and I prayed for him went on about my business came back later on and hooked the bush hog up started bush hogging and then the Lord just spoke to my heart that he's a very present help in a time of need and so God started elevating my faith you know because uh uh uh I I was believing for complete deliverance you know I'm not going to be on this medication CU God's word says by my stripes you're healed so I started believing you know I'm starting God's starting to work on my life and uh I had a buddy of mine he'd been struggling with with meth you know uh for uh like 10 years he come clean to me and I I knew he needed to be led to the Lord I said well alls I know is we can create an environment where the Lord feels welcome we can fast we can pray we can listen to sermons and you know just have church where two or three are gathered in the midst he'd be well as it was coming down to it he flakes on me and the Lord spoke to me and said what about me and you I said let's go yes so I went on so I started fasting and praying and I'm going through it and God God started dealing with me and I'm off my medication and everything I start I check my blood pressure I remember checking my blood pressure it was through the I'm like oh man and and he had told me it was like there was something I must do Peter had to take that first step onto the water so I had to take that first step and as I he I am out here on the water you know you know you got all these fears they told me I they actually told me I would die if I quit taking my medication so here I am now we're out here walking on the water and the waves are crashing you know you got all them all what the doctors and the Devils try to tell you but we got God's word you know and so God God was allowing me to uh uh go through this and then and as I checked my blood pressure I remember the sermon I was watching he said there's no retreat in God's Army we're only pressing forward so I just kept on marching on I woke up the next morning I checked my blood pressure it was through the roof again I'm like oh man I just expected it's going to be perfect and then I was like you know what I said far as I know you're lying to me and I went in there and I put it in in the kitchen cabinet and I stood up and he said uh it's not every day you can risk Dying by taking me of my word he said but man shall not live by bread alone but every word to proceed out of mouth of God and I realized at that point I was walking talking living breathing by God's word amen and now now that's where he's changed my life he's became a a real reality the word made flesh again in my life because he said I'm the Lord thy God that heals all thy diseases blessed be the name of the Lord so now we see that you know like brother Ry or John Ryan you know we don't we don't care what we feel like we know what God's word says blessed be his name and he has spoke to my heart and just showed me that you know I'm a billboard for the gospel the good news who Christ says free is free indeed I'm only a reflection of him God hung his billboard way up high on the cross for the world to see he said in Isaiah by my stripes you are healed and he was wounded for my transgressions huh and so now I'm reflecting him in the living manifestation with power and demonstration he said in John 3:30 I must decrease so he can increase and my story wouldn't be my story if it wasn't for Jesus Christ that's why I like to lift his great name up and magnify his great name if it wasn't for the grace of God where would we all be but here we are united in Christ under this revealed word for our day you know what an honor and privilege it is to sit here around the master's table and feed on this Mana from Heaven this message of Jesus Christ and who he is personally to you it gives us more faith to overcome all things for faith comes by hearing and he's alive and well living

that we plan in the in the winter time they they are subject to change due to weather even even tomorrow we're still kind of up in the air on what what the weather is going to be like so we'll just let you know on that but also we want you to be uh praying about this uh we're going to have brother Tom and brother Michael Ray again ministering for us on March 15th and 16th weekend so we just ask that you'd be remembering those things amen how many has a need tonight that you'd like to make known unto the Lord amen God sees each and every one of our hands amen let's just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we come before you Lord Jesus Lord as a as a body of Believers Lord we have United our faith together Lord Jesus and we've been spoken to you Lord through song and we've been spoken to by you Lord Jesus Through the testimony of our brother Richmond and Lord we've seen your handiwork come amongst us Lord over and over again we've seen how special Lord Jesus this bride is to you Lord that you are constantly raising her up and putting the enemy back under her feet father I pray that tonight by the preaching of the word that you would come and minister to us Lord Jesus we we are subject to this world and subject to Le osia but I pray that you would begin to allow the Holy Spirit to roll over our lives and minister to us in a specific way and let the fire of the Holy Ghost burn the coldness of Le osia out and that you would just come Lord Jesus Lord we are a needy people we have needs that you would Minister and only you can so we invite you the almighty God to come now God we don't know what the future holds but we are so thankful to know that you're holding it and we invite you Lord Jesus just to our Pew just now and just to kind of get ourselves out of the way just for a minute that you'd not only anoint the speaker but you would anoint the hearer as well and that the Holy Ghost would come and we would say wasn't it good for us to talk with him as he went by the way through Elton and Minister To Us by the preaching of the word and God we dedicate our life to you Lord I sacrifice myself father Lord for your service just now in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen if you have your Bibles this evening wouldd like to look over in the Book of Ecclesiastes chapter 8 and Revelations chapter 3 3 Ecclesiastes chapter 8 Revelations chapter 3 how many loves the Lord Lord amen well we would say that's almost a stupid question you wouldn't be here if you didn't love him that's right amen we'd like to just continue on with a thought that the Lord's laid on our heart for this weekend on the king's domain amen Ecclesiastes chapter 8 verse4 declares that where the word of a king is there is power and who may say unto him what doest thou Revelations chapter 3 and verse 20 this is Jesus speaking here to the to the last Church age he says behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and him sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches may God bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord and we as we said we'd like to take a thought on the king's domain brother Barham uh would say in the message how can I overcome he said did you notice the arrangements of that see set with me in my Throne not on my throne but in my Throne he said that's in his domain now as Christ is the ruler Throne ruler at this time of the complete domain of God so will the church be with him the bride be with him in his throne in the entire domain see not on my throne but in my Throne see where his domain reaches a throne is over a domain and a domain reaches just as as far as it boundaries does and this is from eternity to Eternity just think of it just think of it you see so we realize that the believer's domain is from eternity to Eternity and we realize that God has released a specific people in this hour at a specific time and we realize that if we're going to run in this race that we want to do with everything that is within us and we know that God has has preserved a special class of people that are going to be known as not just survivors of leysia but they're going to be known as the Overcomers of Le oosa and we realize that it is one of the darkest of days because we realize that even when William brandham was drawing these things out in the seven Church ages we realize that brother brandham actually said that he said the Lord allowed me to draw some light in there and that light is you now Paul would say in the in the message of Hebrews 12 and 28 when he is writing out this letter that he said now wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear and William Brandon picks that up in the message on the world is again falling apart he says now how do we get into it for we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved he said how do we get into it he said it's not by a religious system but a kingdom of God is within you say that that he the kingdom of God is is is within you let's say that together the kingdom of God is within you theing Kingdom the king and his word is the same it's within you vindicating the hour that we are now living the promise that God made for this age here we are living with the king living with the King sitting in Heavenly places watching him do doing these things we are sitting here together in Heavenly places watching him do these things now we realize that that that we have seen some very powerful things a very powerful testimony where we we could go back all the way in the message and we could pull out Georgie Carter we could pull out we could pull out Congressman Upshaw but we realize that we are sitting in the same place that Congressman Upshaw was sitting in and we're sitting in the same spot that Georgie Carter was setting in and we're sitting in the same spot that that little bitty old woman that had cataracts that wrapped around her eyes that we're sitting here in the same place and we realized that the things that we're doing and what we are watching we are watching him move in action and in power and ined and we realize that God has God our king is not sitting here he's not wasting Potentials in this hour but he has deposited a certain thing in this hour he's not wasting he's not wasting his potentials by simply just letting it out there and to see if it'll come to pass or not but you see whatever God has for you is for you it ain't for somebody else it ain't for another generation that's coming back to finish this but you are the final Voice through the final age so so what God has for you here in this layot ofy and church age there is no reserves if I could say it that way there there's not a bank up in heaven that God is saying I've got to hold this back for such and such time or I've got to hold these things back or I got to reserve a little bit of power but we realize that in this hour that the days of holding back are over if we could say it that way because God is releasing all of the almighty everything that he is he has poured out in the Church of the L osia and he is showing it there as a token in this generation that the days of holding back are over what Martin tried to what he tried to thrive at what Luther tried to thrive at what Wesley tried to thrive at that day is right here right now I believe that we are running a race and I believe that we ought to run with everything that's that is within us I believe that all of Heaven is counting on you and I and that the king and his word are exactly the same and the reason why there's such power in this hour is that there is a Oneness that has been brought by the mighty angel that the king and the word are exactly the same now you remember what William Brandon would say in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said now it was the anointed man but now it's the anointed people why it's the anointed people by anointed by accepting what Eve turned down you see what she turned down it put her out of perfection but what you and I are accepting it is placing us right back into Perfection you see she started eating off the tree of knowledge she started eating off of it and it placed her out of perfection but you have been feeding not on the tree of knowledge but you have been feeding on the tree of life and it has placed you right here in Satan's Eden back into Perfection as the body of Jesus Christ now we we are very familiar with this quote but I I want to preach this I want to preach this to you if I can out of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church age book brother Ron would say now have you ever noticed how Satan hates two books of the Bible more than all others he said through Theo uh through liberal theologians and pseudo scientists he is always a attacking the Book of Genesis and the Book of Revelation he said in both of these books we find Satan's origin and his awful ways and his destruction that is why he attacks him now you can just imagine just for a minute of walking into a to a dark room where it's filled with all kind of hidden dangers and and to a father you know exactly what I'm talking about by walking into a walking into your child's room in the dark and you step on a Lego it's all kinds of dark it's all kinds of danger that are laying out there you see you see they just imagine that as as you begin to walk into a dark room that that you can't see the hidden dangers that are there but all you got to do is go on over there and cut on the light and you can see all the traps that are around you and you can you can see how to get around every Hazard because of bright light it makes all of the hazards become visible and allows you to be able to navigate safely through all the troubles you see the reason why Satan hates the Book of Genesis and the Book of Revelation is because these books are a lot and it shows and Reveals His origin it shows his method and it shows his ultimate defeat so we realize that Satan can operate but he cannot operate effectively because there is a revelation that has been shown in this generation and this light that has been shown in this generation it exposes Satan for what he is and the Bible said in John 1 and5 that the light shineth in darkness and the dark comprehended it not so if we can look at it in another translation it says that the light is so powerful that the darkness cannot overcome it so the troubles that you're going to go through and the dangers that you're going to walk around the revelation of the Malachi 4 preaching the message of the hour gives you the ability to walk around all the dangers of Le osia now he goes on to say he hates to be exposed and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is and he said Jesus said about Satan he has no part in me and I have no part in him he said the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all that he can to destroy confidence in the word but when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spirit revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her you remember when the when the Prophet Elijah is confronted by the by the prophets of Baal and Elijah standing up there on Mount Carmel and there becomes a a a a great challenge of the hour whether God was God or whether the prophets of Baal were really representing the god that they were talking about but you see what what showed the difference was when Elijah began to talk to almighty God that he started talking and praying to almighty God and fire came down and it exposed all the false gods and it showed that they had a powerless nature about them that's what the message of the hour has done it has shown and exposed Satan that he has a powerless nature that he ain't nothing but a lying Devil he's going around like a roaring Lon seeking whom he may devour but we realize that that old line that Old Devil he ain't got nothing but a bunch of bark about him he ain't got no teeth in his mouth because the teeth have been smashed out at Calvary that's what the message did it exposed the false gods of this hour brother ROM said now now he said now going on he said let me show you another reason why Satan hates us Book of Revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows Satan knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and it changes not and he knows that a whole lot more than 90% of theologians do ain't that powerful that Satan knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday day and forever more than 90% of theologians do so I don't care I don't care what class you put yourself in if you know the same yesterday today and forever you're doing a whole lot better than theologians are he said he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways thus Satan knows assuredly that the original Church of Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be I love this he says now remember this I love it when you go through the script and you start looking at a prophetic word a prophet's word and he starts he starts pointing back he starts showing things to the people of that generation and William brandom standing here he said now remember this now remember this now this is one thing you want to catch is when William brandom is going through the message and he says now be careful to catch this make sure that you get this he said now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts so you're not going to be able to tell the difference between them it's going to be a continuation you see you can tell the difference in chapters is when a different author takes over but there's no change in authors here but the same author that wrote the first book of Acts is the same author that is right in the second book of Acts there is no change over in authors just the players are different instead of it saying Paul it now says Jordan instead of it saying Peter it now says Gabriel instead of it saying William brandom it now says you but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and discrediting of God's word right down to the time that he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fo that he cannot stand it he knows Hallelujah that's one thing when you know it and it's one thing when God knows it but when Satan knows it that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works and she will be an invincible Army that means that you will be Unstoppable by Satan but the church's invincibility it lies in Discerning and resisting the Antichrist spirit in this hour you see there has something very powerful about the body of Jesus Christ she is the most Discerning people that there is on the face of the Earth you can tell whether it's real or not there's a lot of people can sing the house down and then there there's something special about a holy ghost filled son and daughter of God you can see a reality between her between her and the churches of the world is because there is a reality to it there's a power behind it and so your invincibility is lying and destined upon discrediting Satan's kingdom and it lied right there in resisting the Antichrist Spirit you see there's a lot of there's a lot of famous artwork out there in the world today there's a lot of there's a lot of nice things of of artwork or paintings but you see there there's a lot of counterfeits out there as well amen there's a lot of counterfeits out there in the world and and if you're in that stage of where you're looking at certain things there's there's counterfeit paintings that that that deceive many of people I could go in to go in there and pull out some of those counterfeits that have had fooled some of them experts but I just want to point out this but until an expert shows and reveals the flaws in it you see you see you'll just think it's just like everybody else you'll think it's a real thing but when the expert eye goes in there and it starts revealing the flaws it begins to expose it that it's a fact that it's a fake in the reality of it you see that's what Revelation does to the Church of the Living God it is an expert eye that reveals Satan is a counterfeit that he could be working in the name of church he could be acting in the name of a church but Revelation is the expert eye that shows that Satan what he's doing this hour is a counterfeit he said now if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her let say it together Satan will be powerless before her he will be as defitely thwarted today as when Christ wasto stood every effort to gain power over him in a desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail against him you remember over in the book of kings that you'll find that that there was a king by the name of Aram and and there he be to make out War tactics of where he was going to move throughout the land of Israel here and there and he would set up his kingdom and he was going to go fight here or fight there and then they come to find out that that before they could ever get there they that that that the armies of Israel already knew where that King Aram was going to be at and he actually got mad thought well I've got a I've got an Insider in here that's beginning to tell begin to tell my War tactics before we ever get there on the Battleground and they come to find out it wasn't nobody else but Elijah there that was in that land he started telling that the Bible said that Elijah knew the very secrets of the king's heart even in his bed chamber they started telling well it ain't none of us we ain't turned on your king AR but it's a prophet up there can you imagine in this generation before before Russia ever was Russia they was known as a Soviet Union could you imagine that all of a sudden Russia gets noised that there's a prophet in 1933 that starts screaming out watch Russia watch Russia that there's somebody that knows what we're going to do before we ever get there you got to think that they didn't become they didn't become a Mother Russia into the 70s and ' 80s but there was a prophet that saw what Russia was going to become the King of the North I say this there's a God on your [Applause] side there's a God on your side that already knows that the enemy is going to be defeated he already knows the plans of Satan yes yeah imagine that'd be a pretty good deal if the Washington Redskins could actually figure out what the lions were going to do before they ever got there it'd be a pretty good game if they already knew every play that was that they was getting ready to come out of it'd be the very first time that they would actually actually have a winning chance on their side but you and I have a better chance than the than the Kansas City Chiefs or the Washington Redskins or any ball team out there we've had a God that has lined out the map of where Satan is going to be at and and he had a prophet stand there said don't go there don't go there but if you're going to worship Worship in the place that I choose to put my [Applause] name before the enemy could ever get there God had already surrounded the enemy he going to go up there and attack Elijah it's gonna go up there attack William Brandon so they set up his plan to have this meeting up there and will brandom had already found out what the plans was and said it ain't going to be in this room it'll be in that room and you might be worried about what's going to happen with the message and what's going on with this and what's going on with that I want you to know that there's more surrounding us than the enemy that is trying to surround us that before the enemy ever gets into the picture God's got Angel armies that are at his demand that all he has to do is say go forth now you might get shook up and say where are they at All I'm gonna say is like Elijah God opened up their eyes that they might see there's more with us than there is against [Music] us hallelujah Billy Graham would tell a story about a missionary that was that was going over over into a foreign country he from Scotland the missionary was he went over he went over into uh in a foreign country and and and these these uh these tribes were so upset they were so up upset that they uh that this missionary and his family was coming in there spreading the name of Jesus Christ and they got so got so worried about it and so shook up they got so mad that he was spread in the name of Jesus Christ that they threatened they was going to kill him and that night when the missionary was was going to bed and everything that tribe that created a mob and they were coming out there they going to kill this missionary and his family Billy Graham said that that that that night that when they got there the tribe got all the way around this missionary and and the mob a and and the mob had to leave and by by by the morning came the missionary said nothing had happened and they knew that they knew that they was coming for him but nothing happened well years later Billy Graham said at that missionary he met that he met that guy and that that mob leader over that tribe and the that mob leader had actually became a Christian at that time and gave his heart over to Jesus Christ and he said he said I want to ask you about that night that you was coming down there and you you you was planning to kill me and my family he said how no well could we attack you he said when we got down there he said it was hundreds and thousands of men standing down there with swords in their hands he said huh I didn't have no Army dispatched but all of Heaven had an army that was dispatched you may not see them in this room it's more than a story of Elijah and Gesa but there's a bride that is on this earth that is surrounded by Angel armies you see true Revelation is the key to overcoming Satan's schemes brother Adam we got too much base and not enough whatever else I need I'm not a sound guy I just know it don't sound right true Revelation is the key to overcoming Satan's schemes is that right it's a true Revelation it's the key to overcoming Satan's schemes just like when Jesus is up there on the mountain in Matthew chapter 4 that he goes up there after receiving the Holy Ghost and the Bible said that the tempter came to him and said if thou be the Son of God cast these stones and turn these stones from stones into bread and Jesus said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God then he takes him Upon A Pinnacle says cast your th self bound and the angels the scripture said that the Angels would bear thee up again and Jesus said it is written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God then he again takes him up and the Bible said that he showed him the kingdoms of the world he said Not only did it say that he showed him the kingdoms of the world but it showed the glory of this world he brought him up to modernday New York he brought him all the way over to the greatest of things in India and he showed them all the glory of it Jesus knew he didn't have to fall to that trap because he already knew that they was going to fall air to him in the Millennium so when Jesus was tented in the wilderness and Satan started twisting the scriptures to deceive him Jesus didn't use power he used the word of God to defeat Satan and expose Satan's lies so the word it is written becomes a weapon in the hands of God's children to say get behind me devil get behind me devil I don't care what he's tempting you about just stand there say get behind me I don't care if he's trying to make you heal yourself or not say get behind me devil I don't care if he's trying to show you that you ain't got power to come out of Temptation say get behind me [Applause] devil this ain't his domain this is your domain you remember when Smith Wigglesworth he was standing there and he was getting ready to get on a he's getting ready to get on the bus and this little woman he said the woman come out there and she was she was out there and she was standing and all of a sudden her little bitt dog run out there and she said get on back here honey you can't come with me today and all of a sudden she she looked down and said get behind me go ahead go go on honey you can't come with me today and the bus pulled up and she saids you got to go on home when she got on the bus and the little dog tried to get on there and the woman said get back Smith looked at her said that's why you got to talk to the devil on that's right that devil wants to hang around you and torment your mind torment your spirit have a talk with him and say get back home this ain't this ain't your playground this ain't your mind this ain't your spirit this ain't your soul get back this ain't Satan's domain this is your domain it's for you it's for our young people it's for our middle class it's for the upper class it's for the middle age it's for the poor and it's for the rich it's the name of Jesus Christ and it is a protection against every FL that the enemy brings against the Church of the Living God well somebody give God praise and we realize we're talking about a domain it's a realm or territory where one that is in power he begins to exercise his authority and he rules and he governs and he's got people that are under his jurisdiction and Paul goes in there I'm not going to read it to you just for time sake but Paul goes in there in Ephesians chapter 6 and said finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and he lays out the protection for God's children in this domain and he starts showing in there that this domain isn't what you're facing is you're not wrestling against you're not wrestling against powers in the natural but you're wrestling against things that aren't tangible things that you can't see but you can feel the effect of them and Paul is laying in there that you have power you have power to make them Powers be subject unto you that you have the ability to make principalities and powers and rulers of the Darkness Be subject to you you see because when you are in a domain there are things that are in that domain that aren't necessarily feeling or tangible but it it actually it shows that that King has the power over influence he has the has the effect and power and the responsibility of those things that are within his realm now I love what William brandom said when he we starts talking about he goes down to Hell how that Jesus goes down to Hell and he he goes down through there and he drops off a package he drops off your sin and he goes on down there and there's Satan waiting on him there's Satan waiting on him he said I waited for you I look for you in job I I look for you in Daniel I look for you in all the prophets I look for you and able but you're finally here and I love what William brandham does he literally turns it around and he said now this ain't your domain he said but this he said Satan said he said now you find me in my domain that's what William brandham said that Satan said that that you're now in my domain well it wasn't his for long because Jesus showed up in Satan's domain and took all of his power away from him William brandham said he drop kicked Satan and pulled the keys off of him of death hell and the grave so therefore you have the ability as a son and daughter of God to say the enemy that is tempting you and the enemy that is fighting against you don't have the keys to his own [Applause] house now let me ask you something if you got the keys to your house you can go in and go out when you please but when you don't have the keys when you don't have the keys your ax has been H your exess has been shut off so if he says you're going to die with suicide our almighty God has already shut the door off to that devil if he says you're going by cancer he's already got the keys to that in his [Applause] hand Hallelujah you see that's why Jesus would stand there and he starts showing his kingdom when a man comes to him by night and he begin to tell him said now Master we know that thou art sent from God for only God can do the things that you're doing and Jesus has a conversation with him and said verily verily absolutely absolutely I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God brother Maron picks that up and why I'm against organized religion he said Born Again means a new birth from above birth from above then we are active in the things from above oh my for it is himself acting in his word through you his Branch to the vine he said that's the the reason that Jesus said if I do not the works of my father believe me not you see that's what makes a kingdom or we could change out that word there and we could say family we could say a business we could say a home that's what makes a kingdom or a family so powerful is that when you could say is that when you can say that the subjects is that the subjects are subjected to the king's demands or the boss's demands or the father's demands that they that the Kingdom actually moves by the Kingdom's influence by the king's power whether the king is there or whether the king is not there because they recognize as a family that whether you're there as a head of your home or not they recognize that they're representing the head or you could say well you know it's a very hard thing when you can find somebody that actually work come on come on and then actually represent the boss there's a lot of people that know how to do good things when the boss is around come on are you with me there's a lot of people that know how to do good things when the boss is looking but when the boss ain't looking or when the husband ain't home or when the when the daddy ain't around on it shows that you're still under the influence of the king is when the king's not around and when the king ain't looking that you're still acting and moving according to the king's demands that this is what he wants done that's why he said there's a Harmony between the bride and the bridegroom she knows what he wants done with the word now we know he's not hearing his physical body but he's hearing a bride coming of Jesus Christ so she knows what he wants done with the word so what he saw when Congressman Upshaw he wants to see it in you what he saw in Geor G Carter when she laid there for n years but she had the faith of Abraham that said I'm coming up out of this bed he's wanting the same thing out of you is that right you see that shows the real power of the king it's maybe he's all fighting another battle but his Queen still knows that this is what he wants done there's a lot of times when you recognize you're in the presence of almighty God like you are right now and you sense the pillar of fire moving through the building all of a sudden it makes Joy shouts break out and all of a sudden a super natural manifest but when the supernatural isn't there and when you don't feel it do you still act the same way that you do right here or do you still handle yourself the same way that you do right here as on Monday you see that's what makes the Kingdom so powerful is it doesn't just resist or it doesn't just assist and live in one place but the power of the Holy Ghost is with you on your job it's with you in your economy it's with you when you're driving down the car the power of the Holy Ghost that's Hallelujah it doesn't matter whether you feel him or whether you don't but King knows he can trust [Applause] you you remember brother you remember to me it's what makes the story of the King's son so powerful is that even though he wasn't in his kingdom he was still representing his kingdom you remember when the slave broker was standing there said I I want that man he said well he's not for sale he said well do you feed him different do you treat him different he said oh I don't feed him different or treat him different he said I wanted the same thing you see but I found out that back in his homeland he was a King's son so he handled himself like a King's son even though he was in circumstances of being beat and tormented and things that he didn't even want to be done to him but just because he was going through a trial did not change the circumstance that he was a King's son the devil may have robbed everything from you but it doesn't change a circumstance that you are predestinated by almighty [Applause] God come on your circumstances don't change your predestination it proves it that's right M drop let Satan come let him torment your mind let him torment your family you're still a King's son let him Rob your health you're still a King's son let him try to steal your family you're still a King's son let him try to Rob your business from you you're still a King's son let him try to tell you that it's for days gone by you're still a King's son and if a king is over top of a kingdom and he's got children in a land he knows there's still power right Amen to operate like a king there's a lot of people that brother ROM would call him fundamentalist and then he'd call him Pentecostal he said there's a lot of people that know the scriptures on it he said but they don't know who they are he said then you got Pentecostals he said they know who they are but ain't got no power to back it up he said oh if I could only get the man that's got the money in the bank with the check the guys that's got the ability to write the check he said if I could ever tie them together you see that's what the Holy Spirit has done by the anointing of the mighty angel coming down in this generation it's given you a re that you got power and you got ability your ability is not in your own self it's in the apparence of the king you're never going to have no power unless you have an encounter with the king I I I'm going to dance around this but there was an individual that one time asked how did you get that power like you got now was just talking talking to the ministry said how did you get that power like you got how how did you get where you are well nobody put us here amen God put you here that's how how do you get that power how do I how do I develop that kind of ministry how do I do how do I how do how do how how how I think it's amazing it's the difference is that God had had somebody that had an encounter with it there's a lot of people that long for the holy ghost that you got but they never had an encounter with it you see Moses was a was a fine example of having an encounter with the King now he'd been acquainted with Kings and Pharaohs of different lands down there in Egypt but there was something different about about being On The Backs side of the desert you see you see what makes Moses's story so great to me is that Moses got to a spot that he believed in the king enough that he wanted to meet him for himself and that there he was on the backs side of desert and he looked like a Shepherd but really he was a King in action because there's something powerful about learning the ways of a Shepherd before you can become a king or a ruler over top of situations now let me just give you a full picture of this here's a man that's got a got a bad case of sunburn on him he's got a bad stutter and he walks around in a with a stick in his hand and he talks to bushes come on that's our leader that's old stuttering Mo up there got power up there talking to a bush right now you think alcatra had thems a good problem down there trying to figure out how them three four guys got themselves out of that but here's a guy that stutters talks to talks to a bush and carries a stick in his hand he's getting ready to walk out and have the most recorded jailbreak that's ever took place where two million people walk out in one night yeah he may have been stutter maybe maybe he did have a conversation with a bush up there but the power was is that the power left the bush and came on no m you see that's what makes a difference between you and the rest of the world is the power left the bush and came onto you that Pillar of Fire has everything that you're [Applause] lacking I'd say oh mo could give us a talk couldn't you I was up there and I was talking in this bush and all of a sudden that Bush started telling me that I am the great I am and I'm going to go down there and I'm sending you I have heard their cries I've heard them talk about leosia I've heard them talk about the problems that Satan had given them right here in the midst of it but tell them not to worry the I am is coming down to deliver them come on somebody what do you got in your hand little bride it's not a king sword but it's the king sword you imagine Joshua down there all the Israelites they down there and they working they working all the day long brother Jerry and I'd say they got to a spot in their life that they actually hated working in the Sun that they was looking for some shade every once in a while because they got sick and tired of building bricks for people they wern't going to they W going to live in them bricks but they was building bricks for these these Hypocrites and he's building bricks for people that acted like they love Joseph at one time but now they're down there building out bricks for somebody I'd say they got to a spot that they hated working in the sun that's right but you know what's so powerful to me is that Joshua was down there and he was working on them he was working on them bricks too and he knew what it took to overcome all them bricks because God had somebody that was in Authority that knew how to build them bricks but when he got over there in Jericho he knew what kind of power that it was going to take to throw down them walls because they had somebody that built them now there's something powerful about somebody that knows how to build something they're typically pretty good at tearing down things too and Joshua recognized that he didn't have the power on the inside of him to tear it down but he was standing there with a king that had a sword in his hand and so this is how you're going to do it you're going to walk around it for silence for six days through six Church ages but on the seventh age you're going to walk around it seven times and when you walk around it on the seventh time the days of small things that have been rejected and the days that things that things have gone by I'm going to release it come on there's a people that despise the day of small things but this ain't no small thing to the Church of the Living God it's now time that your message gets sounded remember when Brother Joseph hammed came here and preached he said until our shout meets our Miracle matches our Miracle then the miracle will never take place but when I shout the message matches the miracle let me say this to you Wesley's message could not meet the answer for this generation I love everything I I've studied Wesley I've studied Luther I've looked through it but they didn't have no power to get me out of here come on somebody Moses's Authority stopped when he died and Joshua simply car sorry say that let me bring that back again Moses affecting the human as a human it stopped when he died but there was a man that gathered what Moses said there's somebody that gathered William brandham said William brandham as a man can't do no more for you but his effect is still working in a people called the body of Jesus Christ and Joshua starts taking what Moses said and he said I'll meditate on these things day and night be strong and courageous everywhere I step I'm going to step right there exactly where the message said step my Joshua didn't have to create some new message that's right all Joshua had to do was preach the same message that's right that's right you ain't got to go out and create some new reel or some new tape all you got to do is say what the prophet already said I'd say Joshua got sick and tired of looking that son down in Egypt but he was standing there in Joshua chapter 10 he instead of him hating that son he loved that son because he needed that son to stand still so the same thing that he hated was the same thing that he loved and he turned it around and he used the power of the son to destroy his enemy that's right [Music] Hallelujah you still love the Lord Brother man would say it like this he said now you don't have to knck down to the devil we got a law That's the Law of the Holy Spirit the only thing you have to do is know how to let go and let God Lord he said but you keep fighting at and say well that won't never work he said when you let go and let God and he goes on to say that that if a fish said well I wait I'll just catch my breath real good and I'll breathe in a little bit of oxygen and said I'll see how far I can go down he said that little fish he said he's going to burst he said if the bird says I I'll see how fast I can run down here maybe I'll take off no he won't do it he'll fall down he said you see he's got to know how to control how that law can control him he said and that's the same way it is with us it isn't what we fight and what we pull and hurry oh if I could if I don't get this if I don't get that that's not it it's to know that the law of life is in you you just got to let go and let God he said then he takes you to your healing then he takes you to the baptism of the spirit or anything that he's promised any claim that he's given you it's yours by letting go and letting God now we're going to get to some power here he said if the officer he said that was going to take the fellow that broke in there and stole your property he was going to take him to the court and you keep pulling the officer back and say well I I don't know whether should do this or not he'll never get the guy there he said but you got to let him go you keep calling the law and telling them that the devil has come in there and tried to Rob your family you can't hold him back let him go you keep getting tormented with lust you can't pull the law officer back let him go [Applause] you keep asking them to come down and bless your finances but you keep pulling back and not paying your ties you got to let him go you keep asking God to heal you but you keep pulling them back by by taking what a doctor said over what God said stop let him go let him go let him go ex right amen Hall and I me he's trying to swither Slither his way in there that God's already figured out where he's coming to you got to let him go I ain't saying letting the snake go let God turn hisself loose on your problem let him go but as a human we want to hold on to everything I got this figured out somebody somebody on Instagram showed me how to overcome so I'm just going to do it that way no you're not somebody told how to do it on YouTube and somebody told it over here and they got these seven-step programs of how to overcome Temptation and lust and problems no you're not you going to still live with that same devil but if you can ever turn the power of the Holy Ghost loose come on somebody why don't you let him loose why don't you let Christ take over and let him Express himself through you you don't have to settle for anything less than the power of the Holy Ghost of of just barely getting by barely living a Christian Life let him go it belongs to the Church of the Living God the Holy Ghost is here to stop the enemy riding his tracks call The Enforcer of the law and let him go yes H Hallelujah I don't care how big your problem is let the Holy Ghost loose on it I feel I feel like I feel like shouting right now I feel like somebody's catching and they turning something loose in the atmosphere stop holding on to your demons stop holding on to your problems stop holding on to what you know and sometimes what you're holding on to is tradition that's the way Homer Fraser did it that's the way Roby that's the way brother Roby Turner did it that's the way Henry green did it that's the way this one did it let it [Applause] go that's the way Paul did it that's the way Peter did it that's the way William brand did it let let God do [Applause] it come on somebody come on I wish I had a set of keys somebody got a key a set of keys up in here go ahead say it's rattling things rattling things anybody else got some keys in here come on remind the devil he ain't got the keys to his own house he don't have the keys to death he don't have the keys to hell he don't have the keys to the Grave so what is trying to lock you up in has all almighty God has already set himself loose let him go that's why Peter had such force on the day of Pentecost he stood up there and preached the 15 minutes seron and said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remissions of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost William brandham said in question answers 195 four he said when Peter said that the keys that he received up there in Matthew chapter 16 that these Keys of the Kingdom I'll give you to bind on Earth I'll bind it in heaven and what you loose on Earth I'll loose in heaven he said on that day after the day of Pentecost he said the key stuck in heaven and it stayed [Applause] there you got the authority of the king that's why Peter had such power he could go to the book he could go through Acts chapter 3 lay his hand lay his hand on the one that was lame from ever since he was a mother's womb he had the power to heal sick and cast out demons in Acts chapter 5 you see judgment as Peter would stand there over ananas and Safara you see because Peter had the authority he had the keys to the kingdom you see him walking down there he goes down there to the man by the name of anas he was paralyzed and been in bed for eight years and when he heard about it when he heard about it Peter walked over in there and said unto ananas said Jesus Christ makes you whole get up out of your bed get up out of your I can't do this because Jesus already dead Peter had such a force behind him that he could walk over in there when a woman by the name of Dorcas also known as abatha when she's there in Acts chapter 9 and she was doing a good work and she was making coats and blankets for the kingdom of God and Etc when Peter heard about it and they heard that Peter was in the city Peter walked over there where he was where Dorcas was laying there dead and he looked on and said Tabitha arise why because the Keys of the Kingdom were in effect they knew they were in effect when Paul when Peter is up there in the common prison in Acts chap 12 and they begin to have prayer over in John Mark's house that they begin to authoritie authorize the power of them keys and he started praying and an angel let him out brother but to me one of the greatest Miracles that Peter does is when he's standing there in Acts chapter 8 and he starts hearing about Samaria how they heard and receive the word of the Lord and when he heard about it he went down there and laids hands on them right and when he laid their hands on them that they received the Holy Ghost right there you see there was going to be plenty more demons that needed to be cast out there was going to be plenty of people that set themselves in the streets so that Peter's power or his shadow would walk over top of them but the major difference was these Miracles these healings would come and they would go demons would resist and demons would resist again but what happened when they received the Holy Ghost was eternal amen thank you Lord it's no longer one man bride one man message it was the anointed man but now it's the anointed people by accepting what Eve turned down so the name of the king when you're buried in his name you carry all power and authority that the King has if I could say it like this is that the King has confidence in his seal am I'm I'm coming down real real quick like brother Joel would say it's a helicopter he's just going to land it but the King has got confidence in his seal because it can't be impersonated and he knows where it's at and he's placed some final runners in this age that they're going to run with a message and they've got the king scepter in their hand and didn't matter who stood in front of them it didn't matter who tried to stop him he had a message from the King and he was going to run with everything within him to carry that message you see when when they're they're running that that great Olympic run the marathon they're coming in there's a lot of people that are there in the beginning there's a lot of people that are standing around but when it gets about a quarter way through the crowd starts dropping off and the cheers aren't there and then you start running on your your own energy then you might see somebody standing there to encourage you and give you a drink of water as you begin to get in to the the the the halfway mark and a 3/4 Mark and then all of a sudden it goes completely silent and you're running on your own amen the people that were running with you at the beginning are not running there now they're starting to drop off yeah some of them had done went by the way of the grave but when you keep on pushing and it doesn't look like the miracle coming and it doesn't look like it's it's worth battling for you just keep running when nobody else is with you you're not looking around to see if they're there or not because you have a purpose and your purpose is to finish the race you see you you are destined to finish this race whether the other people choose to it choose to do it or not whether they give up of whether or stretch ass to take them off there's something different about you because you are under a king's message and he's anointed you to run the last mile of this race and not give up and not give in and if he saw that you were going to run this race he was going to give you the efforts he was going to give you the energies he was going to give you the power to finish it and you might get into a spot where you're all alone and there's nobody in else but they say it's when you enter the arena your loved one but you saw pass off the scene brother seon there he is there's brother Frasier there's Sister Sarah Thorton there's brother Johnny Morris and you got one more you got one more lap in the building and all of a sudden it's quiet on the outside and as you begin to enter into the arena you hear the Roar of a crowd you can finish this race we're not perfect without you run run run and then you start hear the Roar of the crowd they're behind you you don't have 0% left you gave your all you gave your best but they're chearing you on and you're running on fumes as it seems but then the king gives you a shout and you start getting another second wind and you run and you run and all of a sudden the gate swings wide and you're running [Applause] could I say it like this as a musicans come you're who we've been waiting for amen Moses said what it was like when he overcome in his age Paul said it was like What He overcame in his age William brandham stood in this generation but he's not going to stand there alone there's a body of Believers that have run with this king's message amen amen I don't know how many's going to fall away but I know I'm going to keep running I don't know how many is going to go by the way of the grave but I'm going to keep on running I don't know how many is going to disbelieve but I'm going to keep on running let's stand Hallelujah Hallelujah I hear the sound of A rushian Mighty Wind and it's blowing stronger now than it ever did then I'm going to run with everything that's within me hallelujah hallelujah there was some song sung about putting Satan back under your feet I open up my Bible this evening and it open up to Esther chapter n it's a feast of purum it's time you put the devil underneath your feet and show him
