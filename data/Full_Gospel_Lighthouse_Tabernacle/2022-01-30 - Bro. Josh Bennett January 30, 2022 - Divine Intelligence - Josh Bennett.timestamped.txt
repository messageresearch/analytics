[51:47] romans 11 verse 33
[51:52] all the depth of the riches both of the
[51:54] wisdom and knowledge of god
[51:57] how unsearchable are his judgments
[52:00] and his ways past finding out
[52:03] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[52:05] or who hath been his counselor
[52:08] or who had first given to him
[52:10] and it shall be recompensed unto him
[52:13] again
[52:14] for of him
[52:16] and through him
[52:17] and to him
[52:19] are all things to whom be glory
[52:22] forever amen
[52:24] may god add his blessing to the reading
[52:26] of the word you can have your seats this
[52:27] morning
[52:34] thank you brother
[52:35] i'd like to just speak to you for
[52:38] a few minutes on
[52:40] the divine intelligence
[52:46] branham said it this way
[52:48] there in 1958 and the message wire we
[52:50] are not a denomination he said when i
[52:52] look at a tree
[52:54] he said i've been in the woods for a
[52:55] couple of three about two months now and
[52:58] he said i see the tree how pretty it is
[53:00] he said i
[53:01] as it goes down another one comes up in
[53:03] his place his perpetual life
[53:06] now think of that and somewhere that
[53:08] tree had a beginning it had to have a
[53:10] beginning and the only way it could be
[53:12] designated to be a tree or to be an oak
[53:14] or a beach or a popular or
[53:17] whatever it was it had there had to be a
[53:19] master intelligence behind it
[53:22] or just one been an oak tree and
[53:25] everything in the world would have been
[53:26] an oak tree seed but there was something
[53:28] some great master intelligence
[53:31] that had to set it in order he said
[53:33] blessed be his holy name he's the one
[53:36] who set the moon and the stars in the
[53:38] solar system he set everything in his
[53:40] order
[53:41] and he'll set the church in his order
[53:44] there in the church age book
[53:46] the prophet said let me inject a thought
[53:48] in here he said even our natural birth
[53:51] is based on election
[53:53] he said the female ovaries may produce
[53:55] many eggs but why is it that at a
[53:58] certain time a certain egg comes down
[54:00] and not another one see and then amongst
[54:02] the male sperm for no known reason a
[54:06] certain germ attaches itself to the to
[54:08] the egg while others could have just as
[54:10] easily attached themselves or had a
[54:13] better opportunity to do so and did not
[54:16] in paris see there's an intelligence
[54:18] behind all this
[54:20] otherwise what determines whether a baby
[54:22] is a boy or a girl or blonde or brunette
[54:26] or has a light or dark type of eye see
[54:29] and the prophet is saying there's an
[54:30] intelligence behind that
[54:32] and and and you know i know that goes
[54:34] against the uh
[54:36] the modern thinking of today and you
[54:38] know they they they believe that you
[54:40] make your own decision whether you're
[54:42] going to be a boy or a girl but
[54:44] uh i i believe that decision has already
[54:46] been made
[54:48] amen i believe that god made that
[54:50] decision
[54:51] and and and so the prophet is saying
[54:54] even our natural birth is based upon
[54:56] election
[54:57] and he's showing that all this should be
[55:00] telling you you're not here by chance
[55:03] you are not here amen by chance neither
[55:06] are you simply here because you chose to
[55:08] be here
[55:10] but there is something that has brought
[55:12] you here
[55:13] there's an intelligence behind it all
[55:15] and and so i i like how brother branham
[55:18] would say that there's an intelligence
[55:20] behind it all and then another place a
[55:22] master intelligence that's behind it
[55:25] and in in revelation is the fourth
[55:27] chapter
[55:28] uh the bible speaks of the four beasts
[55:31] and the or we will call them the four
[55:33] living creatures and we know that they
[55:35] were full of eyes before and behind and
[55:38] then the bible says they had eyes within
[55:40] and brother branham also picks that up
[55:42] and said it spoke of their intelligence
[55:45] he said see they had eyes in the front
[55:47] they had eyes in the back he said and
[55:49] they had eyes within he said therefore
[55:51] they could see what had been they could
[55:54] see what is now and they could see what
[55:56] will be
[55:58] and and he said it was speaking of their
[56:00] intelligence and we know that those four
[56:01] living creatures would represent the the
[56:04] the anointing of god that would be uh
[56:07] released through the seven church ages
[56:09] all seven church ages would have an
[56:11] anointing that that would
[56:14] would anoint the church to combat the
[56:17] enemy and the age that they lived
[56:19] amen and so those four living creatures
[56:21] were representing those anointed that
[56:23] anointing that would be
[56:25] would come upon the church i don't want
[56:27] to get too deep into that but but we
[56:29] know that in them having these eyes
[56:31] before and behind and within it showed
[56:33] that they knew what had been what is and
[56:36] what would come brother around said
[56:38] reflecting jesus christ the same
[56:40] yesterday
[56:42] amen today and forever throughout all
[56:44] the ages him that was which is and is to
[56:47] come is that right amen and we know that
[56:50] there is only one intelligence amen that
[56:53] knows the beginning from the end
[56:56] amen there's only one intelligence that
[56:58] can speak things amen that is going to
[57:00] happen in the future before they happen
[57:04] only god can do that do you believe that
[57:06] that's why the bible says in isaiah 42
[57:09] and verse say i am the lord that is my
[57:12] name and my glory will i not give to
[57:15] another neither my praise to graven
[57:17] images
[57:18] behold the former things are come to
[57:21] pass and new things do i declare before
[57:23] they spring forth i tell you of them
[57:26] amen i love that because god can tell
[57:30] you about new things in other words god
[57:32] can tell you the future before it gets
[57:34] here
[57:35] is that right isaiah 46 and 9 remember
[57:38] the former things of old for i am god
[57:40] and there is none else i am god and
[57:42] there is none like me
[57:45] declaring the end from the beginning and
[57:47] from ancient times the things that are
[57:49] not yet done saying my counsel shall
[57:51] stand and i will do all my pleasure amen
[57:55] so god is is letting you know amen i
[57:58] know the future
[57:59] amen and i can tell you the future amen
[58:02] before it comes amen i tell you i'm glad
[58:05] that we're serving that kind of god amen
[58:08] because amen nothing ever catches him by
[58:12] surprise
[58:13] amen because he knows all things do you
[58:16] believe that
[58:17] now brother brown said in the easter
[58:19] seal he said do you he said remember
[58:22] this you and the stature that you are in
[58:24] this morning if you wasn't in his
[58:26] thinking then
[58:28] you're not now see
[58:30] see for you there's some part that's in
[58:32] you that's eternal and the eternal only
[58:35] belongs to god and in in god was his
[58:39] thinking of you sitting right where you
[58:41] are now see in his thinking i stood at
[58:44] the pulpit this morning because he's
[58:45] infinite and he knows all things and
[58:47] therefore he could tell the end from the
[58:50] beginning because he's eternal and then
[58:52] you being a son or daughter of god then
[58:55] you were in his thinking at the
[58:56] beginning i love how the prophet is
[58:58] saying god god saw you in the very seat
[59:02] that you're sitting in this morning
[59:04] before you got here
[59:06] even god knew you were going to be here
[59:09] he knew where you're going to be sitting
[59:10] at
[59:11] god knew i was going to be standing and
[59:13] preaching amen behind the pulpit
[59:16] and because he knew who was going to be
[59:19] here he meant he could he could deal
[59:21] with me
[59:22] amen in advance
[59:24] amen and the things that would be spoken
[59:27] even to meet the need that you have
[59:31] even not because i know but because he
[59:34] knows
[59:35] amen and there's a need amen there's
[59:37] something in you that's calling out for
[59:39] some brother brown things that are to be
[59:41] he said it's like a mother expecting a
[59:43] child he said and while she's expecting
[59:46] even that life that's in her begins to
[59:48] call out and she'll send the husband
[59:51] amen on a you know on a mission to go
[59:54] down and and get you know the
[59:56] pickles and ice cream or whatever kind
[59:58] of crazy thing that you know it is but
[1:00:00] there's something in her that's craving
[1:00:03] something is calling out for something
[1:00:05] and the prophet of god said amen and
[1:00:07] there's something in you amen the
[1:00:09] calling and god will send somebody to
[1:00:11] the pulpit
[1:00:14] hallelujah amen and god has already
[1:00:16] dealt with that man amen and laid things
[1:00:19] on his heart amen why amen because you
[1:00:22] have a need
[1:00:25] there's something in you calling out for
[1:00:27] it
[1:00:29] hallelujah church i want you to
[1:00:31] understand something there's a reason
[1:00:33] amen why god's got some god called men
[1:00:35] in this hour that'll preach this message
[1:00:38] that ain't ashamed of the gospel of
[1:00:40] jesus christ there's a reason amen that
[1:00:42] there's still some men amen that'll
[1:00:44] preach the truth i'll tell you that
[1:00:46] reason you're the reason
[1:00:50] hallelujah amen because there's somebody
[1:00:53] amen that needs to receive that word
[1:00:56] [Applause]
[1:01:00] hallelujah
[1:01:01] and god know the end from the beginning
[1:01:04] and therefore he could plan everything
[1:01:07] amen that it would work out just to his
[1:01:09] glory
[1:01:10] and all that gives us courage don't that
[1:01:12] give you courage
[1:01:14] to know that no matter what comes or
[1:01:16] what goes god is making everything the
[1:01:18] clock is ticking just exactly on time
[1:01:22] see sometimes we get weary we get upset
[1:01:24] we get hasty amen we think we must do
[1:01:26] this we must do that but remember god's
[1:01:28] clock will be just exactly on time
[1:01:31] and all these things has to be this way
[1:01:33] it has to be all done according to his
[1:01:35] great knowledge his foreknowledge
[1:01:39] amen god's knowledge is for knowledge in
[1:01:41] other words what's for now it's
[1:01:42] knowledge beforehand
[1:01:45] amen
[1:01:46] god
[1:01:47] has an expectation
[1:01:49] now this is the prophecy god
[1:01:51] has an expectation
[1:01:54] he knows what's going to happen
[1:01:57] amen how many has ever heard it preached
[1:02:00] and i know you've heard it preached you
[1:02:01] got to come with an expectation
[1:02:04] you'll get what you're expecting even
[1:02:06] when you come to the house of god you
[1:02:08] come with expectation
[1:02:10] amen amen and it's important that you
[1:02:12] have an expectation because god will
[1:02:14] meet your expectation
[1:02:15] but now the problem says god's got an
[1:02:17] expectation
[1:02:19] amen and god's expectation amen amen he
[1:02:22] already knows what's going to happen
[1:02:25] amen he knew you were going to be here
[1:02:28] amen and he knew exactly what was going
[1:02:30] to take place
[1:02:33] he says see because he's infinite
[1:02:36] he can foretell the end from the
[1:02:37] beginning because he's god
[1:02:39] and don't you think that satan's putting
[1:02:41] anything over on him
[1:02:44] oh no
[1:02:45] it's just all working out to display his
[1:02:48] attributes
[1:02:49] see this all he meant how could the
[1:02:51] great infinite god who knows everything
[1:02:54] see it's just the attributes of god
[1:02:56] being displayed so now the prophet
[1:02:58] saying satan is not putting something
[1:03:01] over on god
[1:03:03] i like to i've told my church this many
[1:03:05] times god is not up in heaven this
[1:03:08] morning chewing on his fingernails
[1:03:11] in a nervous condition
[1:03:13] he's not looking down at the world and
[1:03:15] thinking man that what a mess and it's
[1:03:17] all falling apart and
[1:03:20] and god and satan's taking control and
[1:03:22] god god ain't nervous about it
[1:03:26] amen he knew it would be this way
[1:03:28] as a matter of fact he wrote he he it's
[1:03:31] in this bible
[1:03:33] amen in kind in end time conditions was
[1:03:37] wrote in this bible thousands of years
[1:03:39] ago god already knew it would be this
[1:03:42] way and satan ain't getting nothing over
[1:03:45] on god
[1:03:47] god is only allowing amen things to take
[1:03:50] place amen to show how great his power
[1:03:53] is
[1:03:56] hallelujah church we're living in
[1:03:58] satan's eden
[1:03:59] how many believes that
[1:04:01] this is satan's eden this is the most
[1:04:03] wicked age that there's ever been
[1:04:06] sin is on the rampage amen look at the
[1:04:09] the rise of homosexuality you're living
[1:04:11] in sodom
[1:04:13] amen and this world ain't getting no
[1:04:14] better
[1:04:16] come on church amen it ain't going to
[1:04:18] get no better
[1:04:20] amen but i got good news amen amen as
[1:04:23] basically as it is and as dark as it
[1:04:26] gets god's still got a bride
[1:04:29] [Applause]
[1:04:31] hallelujah
[1:04:33] and god has allowed this world to get in
[1:04:36] this condition
[1:04:38] to prove to satan that no matter how
[1:04:41] dark it gets no matter how bad it gets
[1:04:44] amen no matter oh come on church amen i
[1:04:47] got a people amen that's gonna stand
[1:04:49] hallelujah i've got a bride that's gonna
[1:04:52] overcome
[1:04:56] and you are going to overcome the enemy
[1:04:59] in his own eden
[1:05:03] church you are a people like no other
[1:05:06] people because you're going to defeat
[1:05:08] satan in his own kingdom
[1:05:13] hallelujah in the very pinnacle of
[1:05:16] sainzin amen god has got overcomers
[1:05:23] hallelujah
[1:05:28] now watch
[1:05:29] god knowed all things brother brown said
[1:05:31] therefore he could plan
[1:05:35] he's never been taken by surprise
[1:05:40] and so
[1:05:42] he said the great
[1:05:44] un unchanging god cannot change
[1:05:48] man changes
[1:05:51] see but you can put your life upon
[1:05:53] anything that god said about said at any
[1:05:56] time because it's the truth
[1:05:59] because it's the only thing i have
[1:06:00] confidence in the prophet says the bible
[1:06:02] because man's word will fail
[1:06:05] but god is supreme
[1:06:08] see this year i know more than i did
[1:06:10] last year and you should too
[1:06:12] each day because we're finite
[1:06:14] so we gain knowledge
[1:06:16] amen we we
[1:06:18] you know we we learn from our mistakes
[1:06:21] or we should
[1:06:23] some of us better than other others but
[1:06:25] you know you know we we're continuing to
[1:06:28] to better ourselves and learn from ours
[1:06:30] and gain knowledge but the prophet said
[1:06:33] that god being infinite he is not
[1:06:36] gaining knowledge
[1:06:38] he is perfect to begin with
[1:06:41] amen therefore every decision he makes
[1:06:45] is perfect
[1:06:48] amen i want to tell you god don't have
[1:06:50] no backup plans
[1:06:53] hallelujah he don't need any
[1:06:57] even because when god makes a plan amen
[1:07:00] he's going to fulfill it
[1:07:02] amen he don't need a backup
[1:07:05] you are not a backup
[1:07:08] you know sometimes some people look and
[1:07:10] they see
[1:07:11] as a scripture would say that jesus came
[1:07:13] to his own his own received him not we
[1:07:15] know he was rejected by his own people
[1:07:18] is that right
[1:07:19] and then the in the gospel goes to the
[1:07:21] gentiles but let me tell you that the
[1:07:24] gentiles was not a backup plan
[1:07:28] amen god did not turn to the gentiles
[1:07:31] because the jews rejected him
[1:07:33] come on church
[1:07:35] amen he didn't come to the jews and said
[1:07:37] well that didn't work out i'll just go
[1:07:39] over here to the gentiles no before he
[1:07:41] ever come he already blinded their eyes
[1:07:45] because he had determined in himself i'm
[1:07:48] gonna have a gentile bride
[1:07:51] hallelujah you're not a backup plan
[1:07:54] you're a part of the original plan
[1:07:59] hallelujah and when god made a decision
[1:08:02] about you
[1:08:03] before the foundation of the world that
[1:08:06] decision was perfect
[1:08:10] he'll never change his mind
[1:08:12] some of y'all ought to shout about it
[1:08:15] amen because god even made a decision
[1:08:18] about you before the foundation of the
[1:08:19] world and some of it sometimes we think
[1:08:22] well you know but but you know look at
[1:08:24] all the mistakes how you don't think he
[1:08:25] knew that
[1:08:27] talking about a god that knows all
[1:08:28] things
[1:08:29] amen he he knew every mistake you would
[1:08:31] make
[1:08:32] he knew the mess you would make out of
[1:08:34] it amen
[1:08:35] he saw that
[1:08:37] amen but he made his decision
[1:08:41] amen before the foundation of the world
[1:08:43] because he could see past that
[1:08:47] hallelujah and he knew you're a part of
[1:08:49] him to begin with
[1:08:53] now watch
[1:08:55] [Music]
[1:08:57] see because we don't know the future
[1:09:01] we we tend to
[1:09:03] look to the past
[1:09:06] how many knows that that that men
[1:09:09] actually
[1:09:10] are able to
[1:09:12] predict the future i would say use the
[1:09:15] word predict
[1:09:17] they can predict future events by
[1:09:19] studying the past
[1:09:21] because history repeats itself
[1:09:24] and
[1:09:25] and men dedicate their their lives to
[1:09:27] you know they study the patterns and and
[1:09:29] these things and they're able to by that
[1:09:31] knowledge they study the past amen in
[1:09:34] other words
[1:09:35] to to gain a knowledge that they may
[1:09:37] predict future events by past events and
[1:09:41] and they do it in the you know in the
[1:09:43] military they do it in the government
[1:09:46] all aspects of life men st they do that
[1:09:49] to
[1:09:50] they study weather patterns and
[1:09:51] everything else amen that they might
[1:09:53] predict the future
[1:09:56] amen because and they're always looking
[1:09:58] to the past because but god don't have
[1:10:00] to do that
[1:10:02] amen and god is not predicting the
[1:10:05] future
[1:10:06] amen he is prophesying he is amen he is
[1:10:10] actually telling you
[1:10:13] in accurate
[1:10:14] detail what's going to happen
[1:10:19] hallelujah
[1:10:21] amen and i'll tell you this amen god
[1:10:24] does not just simply amen say you know a
[1:10:28] a a when a prophet speaks a word of
[1:10:31] prophecy
[1:10:32] it's not simply amen i know
[1:10:35] he's seeing it by vision
[1:10:38] a future event
[1:10:39] but he is not just see simply seeing the
[1:10:42] future and telling you what it's going
[1:10:44] to be he is actually speaking the word
[1:10:47] of god
[1:10:48] amen amen and when that prophecy goes
[1:10:51] forth that word amen can actually cause
[1:10:55] even that event to take place
[1:10:58] so in other words let me say this a word
[1:11:00] of prophecy amen can not only
[1:11:03] uh predict the future it can change the
[1:11:06] future
[1:11:09] [Music]
[1:11:15] and so
[1:11:18] the bible's not a history book
[1:11:23] because god you know there's a lot of
[1:11:25] history books
[1:11:26] there's a lot of history in the bible
[1:11:28] but the bible's not a a history book
[1:11:31] the bible is a book of prophecy
[1:11:34] is that right
[1:11:35] amen because you see a lot of men have
[1:11:37] wrote history books but they have to all
[1:11:39] they can only write about what has been
[1:11:43] even they cannot write about what will
[1:11:46] be
[1:11:48] amen but this bible the prophet said it
[1:11:50] this way he said let me tell you
[1:11:52] something let's just go in the history
[1:11:54] of the bible just a minute and see where
[1:11:56] it come from it was written by 40
[1:11:58] different writers 40 men who wrote the
[1:12:00] bible over the space of 1600 years apart
[1:12:02] at different times predicting the most
[1:12:04] important events that would ever happen
[1:12:06] in the world's history and many times
[1:12:08] hundreds of years before it happened and
[1:12:10] there's not one error in the entire 66
[1:12:14] books
[1:12:16] no author but god himself could be so
[1:12:19] accurate
[1:12:21] hallelujah not one word contradicts the
[1:12:25] other
[1:12:26] amen wrote over a span of 1600 years 40
[1:12:30] different scribes writing the bible amen
[1:12:32] and when they compounded all together
[1:12:34] all their prophecies and writings
[1:12:36] dovetailed perfectly together amen and
[1:12:38] not one contradiction laying in the
[1:12:41] scripture
[1:12:42] amen the prophet said there's only one
[1:12:44] intelligence that could write such a
[1:12:46] book
[1:12:48] that's god himself
[1:12:52] and so
[1:12:53] with that in mind just thinking about
[1:12:55] this how that man has been able by
[1:12:58] history to study
[1:12:59] and
[1:13:00] and and study past victories and past
[1:13:03] feats and and they've done this and by
[1:13:05] that they've they've had advantage in
[1:13:07] the presence see even by studying the
[1:13:10] past it's gave them an advantage in the
[1:13:12] present situations
[1:13:14] and i just thought about that if man
[1:13:16] could look to history
[1:13:19] and it would be an advantage
[1:13:21] to him in the present
[1:13:23] in other words even just thinking about
[1:13:26] on a military uh uh uh platform you know
[1:13:30] if there is if people are in battle amen
[1:13:32] you know they even at sports you know
[1:13:35] they use it all the time amen when
[1:13:36] they're getting ready to face a team
[1:13:38] what they do they watch past games
[1:13:41] and they watch amen how they play and
[1:13:44] amen and how they you know how others
[1:13:46] defended against their offense uh uh you
[1:13:49] know and all these things and they're
[1:13:51] able to take advantage and have an
[1:13:54] advantage when the conflict comes even
[1:13:57] because of what they have seen has
[1:13:58] already happened
[1:14:00] amen and i thought if man was able to do
[1:14:03] that amen and that could be a great
[1:14:05] advantage to him what if you knew the
[1:14:07] future
[1:14:09] what if you actually knew amen where
[1:14:12] your enemy was going to be before he got
[1:14:14] there
[1:14:17] hallelujah
[1:14:18] amen and that's what we find in the
[1:14:20] bible when israel amen was fighting
[1:14:22] against the syrians i believe it was
[1:14:24] amen and the syrian king amen he said he
[1:14:28] said listen he said every time we go to
[1:14:30] battle he said the enemy knows where
[1:14:32] we're going to be before we ever get
[1:14:34] there
[1:14:36] and that king began to look around he
[1:14:37] said listen we got a spy in the camp
[1:14:40] there's a mole around here somewhere
[1:14:42] there's somebody that's telling even the
[1:14:44] secrets amen uh to israel and
[1:14:47] and somebody come up to the key said
[1:14:49] king there ain't no spy in the camp
[1:14:51] amen but the secret of the thing is it's
[1:14:53] a prophet down in israel
[1:14:57] hallelujah and he tells the king of
[1:15:00] israel amen the secret things that you
[1:15:02] think in your bed chamber amen and god
[1:15:05] is giving them a warning and they know
[1:15:08] where we're going to be
[1:15:09] before we ever get there
[1:15:12] come on church and the bible said that
[1:15:15] didn't just happen one time it didn't
[1:15:17] just happen two times even but time
[1:15:19] after time amen god had already warned
[1:15:22] israel of where their enemy was going to
[1:15:24] be
[1:15:26] and the enemy was actually bewildered
[1:15:31] amen they were confused and bewildered
[1:15:33] even because they didn't understand amen
[1:15:36] how israel had such an advantage over
[1:15:38] them and i want to say this this morning
[1:15:40] i think the devil is confused
[1:15:45] i think the devil is bewildered amen
[1:15:48] when he faces this bride he is wondering
[1:15:51] how in the world
[1:15:52] every tactic i've ever used it worked on
[1:15:55] every other group amen but it ain't
[1:15:57] working on me i'm
[1:15:59] hallelujah but let me just let the devil
[1:16:02] in on a secret
[1:16:05] we have had a prophet
[1:16:10] and he is coming this day
[1:16:12] and god our enemy has been exposed
[1:16:16] [Applause]
[1:16:19] hallelujah we know the tactics of our
[1:16:22] enemy
[1:16:25] the tricks of the devil has been exposed
[1:16:33] hallelujah
[1:16:37] brother brown said somebody asked me not
[1:16:39] long ago
[1:16:40] he said
[1:16:41] what do you think about the future i
[1:16:43] said i don't know what the future holds
[1:16:45] but i know who holds a future
[1:16:50] he says so that's the thing if i can
[1:16:52] just keep acquainted with him
[1:16:56] now
[1:16:57] i'm just getting where i really want to
[1:16:58] be this morning because i want you to
[1:17:00] catch this
[1:17:03] seeing the future
[1:17:05] can change the present
[1:17:10] brother madam said
[1:17:12] he's in a discernment now
[1:17:15] said all right lady he said do you
[1:17:17] believe
[1:17:18] these things are taking place from the
[1:17:20] spirit of god he said
[1:17:22] and us being strangers to each other he
[1:17:24] said if something
[1:17:26] would have would happen
[1:17:27] and let me know something about you
[1:17:30] if god can tell me
[1:17:32] what you have been
[1:17:34] surely he can tell me what you will be
[1:17:38] if he knows the past he knows the future
[1:17:41] seeing that makes him god
[1:17:43] another place another prayer line
[1:17:45] brother brown says
[1:17:46] now isn't he lovely sister
[1:17:48] he's the fairest of ten thousand he's
[1:17:50] the lily of the valley he is a morning
[1:17:52] star i perceive right now that you are a
[1:17:55] christian because your spirit begins to
[1:17:57] feel welcome see
[1:17:58] and i know that somewhere standing near
[1:18:00] he's standing because your spirit and
[1:18:02] the holy spirit which is now on me is
[1:18:04] becoming in contact with each other's
[1:18:06] seat and now he can reveal to me and if
[1:18:09] he knows what your past has been
[1:18:11] and you are the judge of that he and he
[1:18:13] tells you what your future will be
[1:18:16] surely if he knows the past he knows the
[1:18:18] future see if he'd tell the future
[1:18:21] before he told the past then you would
[1:18:23] wonder whether it was going to happen or
[1:18:24] not
[1:18:25] but if you tell you what you already
[1:18:27] know
[1:18:28] no has happened then you know whether
[1:18:31] the future is going to be right
[1:18:33] see how he does it it makes it so real
[1:18:35] there's no way out of it
[1:18:38] and then the prophet says now the
[1:18:40] audience can still hear my voice the
[1:18:43] woman seems to be moving away from me
[1:18:45] she's going back i see her she's
[1:18:47] standing in a building she's before a
[1:18:49] doctor the doctor says she has a tumor
[1:18:52] that's a thyroid tumor he says you must
[1:18:55] be operated on frankly i see a shadow
[1:18:58] coming over that that was the been the
[1:18:59] middle of last week you must have been
[1:19:02] operated on but the reason you didn't
[1:19:04] you heard i was coming here and you come
[1:19:06] and wanted me to pray for you before
[1:19:08] that could take place
[1:19:10] thus saith the lord that's true
[1:19:14] now watch because i probably have just
[1:19:16] told this this sister
[1:19:18] if if god would tell you something about
[1:19:20] your past see something that only
[1:19:23] something that she knew that brother
[1:19:25] branham did not know
[1:19:29] even but if god could reach back and
[1:19:31] tell her in great detail something about
[1:19:33] her past he said then you could trust
[1:19:36] what he says about your future
[1:19:41] amen just saying about is that not what
[1:19:43] we've seen
[1:19:44] uh at the woman at the well
[1:19:48] when when jesus meets the woman at the
[1:19:50] well
[1:19:51] he begins to speak to her
[1:19:54] amen and when he began to speed her he
[1:19:55] began to tell her
[1:19:57] he began to tell her about her past
[1:20:00] amen and he began to tell her about mean
[1:20:03] all the the trouble of her life
[1:20:06] amen and but but listen friends amen he
[1:20:09] was not just telling her about her past
[1:20:12] to leave her in that condition
[1:20:17] hey man he was not just telling her
[1:20:18] listen the things that he was telling
[1:20:20] her was not good things
[1:20:23] he was not reaching into her past and
[1:20:25] telling her about how what a good little
[1:20:27] girl she had been and and all the great
[1:20:30] things she had done in her life hey man
[1:20:31] she he was actually telling her about
[1:20:33] all her past and and the mistakes of her
[1:20:36] past and and the failures of her life
[1:20:39] but he was not bringing that up to
[1:20:41] condemn her
[1:20:43] he was not bringing it up to leave her
[1:20:45] in that condition
[1:20:47] he was only telling her about her past
[1:20:49] so that she could trust his word when he
[1:20:51] began to tell her about her future
[1:20:54] [Applause]
[1:20:56] hallelujah let me tell you something
[1:20:58] church this message didn't come to us
[1:21:00] amen to tell us how bad we are and what
[1:21:04] how how what a bad condition that we
[1:21:06] were in only leave us that way
[1:21:09] no sir it only come to tell us amen yes
[1:21:12] amen we were in a bad condition but
[1:21:15] there's a way out of it
[1:21:19] hallelujah amen god is not going to
[1:21:21] leave us in that condition
[1:21:24] [Applause]
[1:21:30] what intelligence could tell us these
[1:21:32] things
[1:21:35] you know
[1:21:36] you remember the story brother brown
[1:21:37] tells about the infidel he goes out he
[1:21:39] goes

[1:21:43] man's property and
[1:21:46] and

[1:21:48] know the
[1:21:51] man says you preachers are barking up
[1:21:53] the wrong tree
[1:21:55] and so
[1:21:56] brother branham you know he don't
[1:21:58] i loved studying the life of the prophet
[1:22:02] brother brown didn't break his bible out
[1:22:06] start coming through scriptures and
[1:22:08] condemning the man's
[1:22:11] he just started talking to him
[1:22:13] and he looked over it and he starts
[1:22:15] talking about a tree
[1:22:18] and you know and and the thing about it
[1:22:20] is is the man said i'll tell you he said
[1:22:23] now there's one preacher i would like to

[1:22:42] that tree and how the sap he said what
[1:22:44] tells the sap amen to go down in the
[1:22:46] winter time and stay there until the
[1:22:48] spring of the year and then come back up

[1:23:00] be some intelligence there's something
[1:23:03] behind that
[1:23:04] amen in other words he was telling the
[1:23:06] man there's a god somewhere there is
[1:23:08] something greater than this
[1:23:12] i told the church a while back because
[1:23:13] you know i i've been studying quite a
[1:23:16] bit and though and the world is moving
[1:23:18] in a direction at a rapid pace
[1:23:20] especially in this generation amen
[1:23:22] people are moving rapidly to the idea
[1:23:25] amen of agnostic or you know or or
[1:23:28] atheists or people that don't believe in
[1:23:30] nothing or even some that just
[1:23:32] acknowledge there's something somewhere
[1:23:33] but we don't know what it is
[1:23:35] amen and people have become so
[1:23:37] open-minded that their brains fell out
[1:23:44] because church i want to tell you
[1:23:48] if you need proof there's god

[1:26:28] they wanted me to watch this video and
[1:26:30] he said would you be willing to do that
[1:26:32] i said absolutely
[1:26:34] not and i said i don't want the material
[1:26:38] and and and and they were pretty
[1:26:40] bothered by it because they said
[1:26:41] man they said
[1:26:44] you're just going to
[1:26:45] put your head in the sand you're leading
[1:26:47] them you're a pastor you've got your
[1:26:49] response for people's souls you're not
[1:26:51] and and and i said well i'm just i know
[1:26:53] i'm not interested
[1:26:56] and you know it's something
[1:26:58] something in me later
[1:27:00] amen because this is the thing that they
[1:27:02] told me and said well if you got what
[1:27:04] you claim you got what are you worried
[1:27:05] about
[1:27:06] you see how the they put the challenge
[1:27:09] if you got what you claim you have what
[1:27:10] are you worried about in other words if
[1:27:12] you if if you believe it's so
[1:27:15] uh uh so if you're standing so firm and
[1:27:18] and you're anchored in the word you've
[1:27:19] got the holy why are you worried about
[1:27:21] it why would you be scared to listen to
[1:27:23] it or read it i'm not afraid of it
[1:27:26] amen but you know i didn't have an
[1:27:28] answer right at the moment but later on
[1:27:30] as i was sitting there thinking about it
[1:27:32] the holy spirit just spoke to my heart
[1:27:34] and said because you have
[1:27:36] what you claim you have
[1:27:39] you won't listen to it
[1:27:42] because you have what you claim you have
[1:27:44] amen you ain't got time for that
[1:27:47] [Applause]
[1:27:51] and i got to thinking about that and you
[1:27:53] know i thought you know
[1:27:55] and and the argument was being made
[1:27:56] about the boy in finland and somebody
[1:27:58] told the story a little different over
[1:28:00] here and some brother wrote wrote
[1:28:02] about it different all the accounts
[1:28:04] weren't lining up and amen and i thought
[1:28:06] amen you know what amen you know why
[1:28:08] they got so much to talk about in
[1:28:10] brother brown's ministry is because
[1:28:12] there's a lot of testimonies to talk
[1:28:14] about
[1:28:15] ain't nobody arguing about people they
[1:28:17] raised from the dead there ain't no
[1:28:19] testimonies amen of anybody they raised
[1:28:21] from the dead amen there ain't nobody
[1:28:23] having no debates about even the visions
[1:28:25] that they had because they ain't never
[1:28:27] had a vision come on church the reason
[1:28:30] why there's so much to criticize is
[1:28:33] because god did so much in this day
[1:28:36] there's so much of the supernatural that
[1:28:39] has taken place in our hour
[1:28:42] that's why every gun out of hell is
[1:28:45] attacking this message
[1:28:51] hallelujah
[1:28:53] i'm way off my notes right now amen but
[1:28:55] i want to tell you this amen i'll make
[1:28:57] this challenge i'll put our young people
[1:29:00] up against any other group
[1:29:03] amen any denomination
[1:29:06] any movement
[1:29:07] come on church amen they say the message
[1:29:10] don't work

[1:29:16] the front of this church
[1:29:18] amen come to my church the front row is
[1:29:21] filled amen with young people young
[1:29:24] girls even hair growth out even dressed
[1:29:27] in modesty young boys that are acting
[1:29:30] like men and not a bunch of sissies
[1:29:33] brother you come too late to tell me
[1:29:36] that the message of the hour don't work
[1:29:40] it works
[1:29:41] [Applause]
[1:29:45] it is producing

[1:30:00] greatest preachers that has ever stood

[1:31:26] begin to gather and
[1:31:28] and he said he said they're getting
[1:31:29] ready to go back in the rivers that they
[1:31:31] were that they were birthed in
[1:31:33] amen they're going to actually to spawn

[1:31:38] the prophet said it but nothing can stop
[1:31:40] them

[1:31:44] is they will go back to the very stream
[1:31:50] amen the very stream that they were
[1:31:51] birthed in
[1:31:53] they will go back to that very what

[1:32:37] but they are not gathering to stay they
[1:32:39] are gathering to leave
[1:32:44] hallelujah

[1:32:54] out there in the ocean they they don't
[1:32:56] come together to see who the biggest

[1:33:52] obstacles

[1:33:58] through fish ladders that they call them
[1:34:00] and and there's bear and there's
[1:34:02] you know there's everything in the world
[1:34:03] trying to stop them
[1:34:06] you know i read a a story a while back

[1:34:16] they released that fish and when it come
[1:34:18] to time with the spawning season that
[1:34:20] fish went right back up that stream
[1:34:23] and they went to the pipe
[1:34:26] that where that hatchery was released
[1:34:29] into that stream
[1:34:31] and that thing was so designed
[1:34:33] to where it would release
[1:34:35] you know
[1:34:36] with could release fish but they
[1:34:38] couldn't swim back in it
[1:34:40] but that fish went back up
[1:34:42] to that
[1:34:43] the entrance of that pipe
[1:34:46] and it just started backing up and
[1:34:47] bumping into that
[1:34:49] and it just kept on
[1:34:52] until it broke through
[1:34:54] swam up
[1:34:57] the very pipeline and back into the very
[1:34:59] hatchery it was born in
[1:35:01] it was a tagged fish and they found that
[1:35:04] fish right back in the exact hatchery
[1:35:06] that it was birthed in

[1:35:16] you amen what intelligence
[1:35:19] told that fish how to get there
[1:35:27] brother brown talks about you know
[1:35:29] though the
[1:35:30] there was a great earthquake going to
[1:35:31] happen in india
[1:35:33] and he said before days before all the
[1:35:36] birds left to flew out of the of the
[1:35:39] rocks of the walls the cattle and the
[1:35:41] different animals that stood in the
[1:35:43] shade of them walls moved out in the
[1:35:44] middle of the field huddled around each
[1:35:46] other amen leaned on one another and
[1:35:48] then days before that event took place
[1:35:52] amen what warned them
[1:35:54] i ask you this what intelligence led the
[1:35:56] animals
[1:35:57] amen to noah's ark in the days of noah

[1:36:37] already determined it before the
[1:36:39] foundation of the world you're not
[1:36:41] keeping yourself you're not holding

[1:37:51] in the vision he sees a doctor
[1:37:54] and the doctors got thick glasses and

[1:38:20] in the audience she said that's my baby
[1:38:23] that's my baby
[1:38:24] brother brown says
[1:38:26] he said yes he said he said that was
[1:38:29] about two years ago he said then the
[1:38:32] vision breaks
[1:38:33] brother brown sees a little girl
[1:38:36] carrying a baby doll
[1:38:38] walking with a baby doll
[1:38:40] he said when he's now now remember he's
[1:38:42] just saw the past
[1:38:44] is that right
[1:38:46] i mean he sees the doc two years ago
[1:38:48] even the girl in the present is in this
[1:38:50] paralyzed condition even but now the
[1:38:53] prophet gets a vision of her future
[1:38:56] and he sees that little girl carrying a
[1:38:59] baby doll
[1:39:00] amen and as he speaks that amen he said
[1:39:04] she's healed it's over mama
[1:39:07] the girl is healed that's the saith the
[1:39:10] lord
[1:39:11] what gave him the courage to say that
[1:39:15] he had already saw a vision of her
[1:39:18] future
[1:39:21] and brother branham
[1:39:22] is beginning to
[1:39:24] if i remember the testimony right
[1:39:27] he's beginning to walk off the platform
[1:39:29] and the meetings come to a close he said
[1:39:31] and then a vision breaks
[1:39:32] he sees uh congressman upshaw in a brown
[1:39:35] suit tipping his hat walking down the
[1:39:37] street
[1:39:38] and then amen he speaks thus saith the
[1:39:41] lord amen the man is healed and for the
[1:39:44] first time in 66 years
[1:39:46] a man stood to his feet
[1:39:49] church i want you to understand i know
[1:39:50] the devil don't like that amen but
[1:39:52] that's the truth that's what god done in
[1:39:55] our day
[1:39:56] and do you know that that congressman
[1:39:58] upshaw said in many of brother brown's
[1:40:00] meetings and even after even the healing
[1:40:03] took place he was sitting in the meeting
[1:40:05] and brother branham would give the
[1:40:06] testimony and the man was sitting right
[1:40:08] there
[1:40:09] and not one time did he ever stand up
[1:40:12] and say that didn't happen that way
[1:40:13] brother man as a matter of fact i do not
[1:40:15] know on one tape at least brother brown
[1:40:17] starts giving the testimony and mr
[1:40:20] upshaw interrupts brother branham
[1:40:23] amen not to contradict what he's saying
[1:40:26] amen but actually to say that is the
[1:40:28] truth one time he walked across the
[1:40:31] platform
[1:40:33] hallelujah amen listen church amen this
[1:40:37] is not amen a fairy tale i'm talking
[1:40:39] about
[1:40:40] [Applause]
[1:40:45] and god told him about the future it
[1:40:47] changed him in the present
[1:40:50] there's another time brother branham
[1:40:52] brother brown was in this in a in africa
[1:40:55] there and he gives this testimony i
[1:40:57] think this testimony is amazing
[1:41:00] and brother brown said there was a in
[1:41:01] the meeting there he said there was tens
[1:41:03] of thousands of people
[1:41:05] and in that meeting you'll remember this
[1:41:08] they brought a boy up on the platform
[1:41:11] and they let him up with a chain
[1:41:14] and he they let him up there like a dog
[1:41:18] and the boy would have been born that
[1:41:20] way and he and and he would you know
[1:41:23] walk like a dog he had just didn't have
[1:41:25] wasn't in his right mind at all couldn't
[1:41:27] speak
[1:41:28] anything
[1:41:30] and you know what's amazing about it
[1:41:31] brother ron is when they brought that
[1:41:33] boy up there
[1:41:34] brother branham under the anointing of
[1:41:36] the holy spirit
[1:41:37] when the boy comes up he says
[1:41:40] he says
[1:41:41] he discerns the boy's heart
[1:41:43] and he says you're thinking about your
[1:41:45] brother
[1:41:48] who is crippled
[1:41:51] could you imagine this boy was born
[1:41:54] amen he wasn't even in his right
[1:41:55] couldn't even speak
[1:41:57] even brother brown said he
[1:41:59] he had been in this condition all his
[1:42:00] life couldn't even speak and now a
[1:42:03] prophet says you're thinking about he's
[1:42:05] discerning what's on this boy's heart
[1:42:07] and he said you're thinking about your
[1:42:09] brother
[1:42:10] who's crippled he fell off a yellow dog
[1:42:13] or a goat or something as he said and he
[1:42:15] said he's crippled and he said way back
[1:42:17] in the audience way back he said nearly
[1:42:20] a half block away he said a boy come
[1:42:23] running down through the audience and he
[1:42:25] threw down he had some clubs that he had
[1:42:27] been walking with and he had threw them
[1:42:29] down or he was lifting them up in his
[1:42:31] hands i believe he said lifting them up
[1:42:33] in the air saying i'm healed i'm healed
[1:42:35] amen then the boy was completely healed
[1:42:42] brother branham had looked back in the
[1:42:44] past he saw that boy fall
[1:42:46] and be injured
[1:42:48] he saw in the future he saw the boy
[1:42:49] walking
[1:42:51] and then brother branham all of a sudden
[1:42:52] he says
[1:42:53] he said he saw a vision now this boy is
[1:42:55] still
[1:42:56] on all four he's he's on his hands and
[1:42:59] feet walking like an animal
[1:43:02] chain around his neck
[1:43:04] and brother brown says
[1:43:06] he said he all of a sudden a vision
[1:43:07] breaks
[1:43:09] and he sees that boy standing on his
[1:43:11] feet
[1:43:12] tears flowing down his face
[1:43:15] in his right mind
[1:43:17] he said i knew it was all over then
[1:43:22] he spoke to the boy in the name of the
[1:43:23] lord jesus christ he said the boy
[1:43:25] couldn't even understand
[1:43:27] he said
[1:43:28] he said the boy when he would begin to
[1:43:30] speak to him he tried to do a little
[1:43:31] dance you know some kind of little dance
[1:43:33] and and and he said he couldn't even
[1:43:35] understand he said he spoke to him in
[1:43:37] the name of the lord he said to rise up
[1:43:39] and i love this because brother brown
[1:43:40] says amen and as he spoke to him he
[1:43:43] reached down
[1:43:44] [Music]
[1:43:47] and he took that chain
[1:43:50] that that had that around that boy's
[1:43:52] neck
[1:43:53] and that prophet of god by seeing that
[1:43:55] vision of the future brother ron he
[1:43:57] reached down and picked that chain up
[1:44:00] and he lifted that boy to his feet
[1:44:03] and for the first time in his life
[1:44:06] he stood upright like a man
[1:44:09] brother brown said tears began to flow
[1:44:11] down his face
[1:44:14] for the first time in his life
[1:44:17] he had his right mind
[1:44:21] listen church it shows the power of our
[1:44:23] god
[1:44:25] he could not even comprehend what was
[1:44:27] being spoken to him
[1:44:30] and neither did he have the ability to
[1:44:32] stand up on his own
[1:44:35] but that didn't stop the grace of god
[1:44:41] if god is determined to save you nothing
[1:44:43] can stop him
[1:44:46] if god is determined to heal you nothing
[1:44:48] can stop him
[1:44:49] church it ain't according to your
[1:44:51] ability
[1:44:53] he didn't even have the ability to
[1:44:54] understand what was being said amen but
[1:44:57] god bypassed all of that and when he
[1:45:00] couldn't stand up by himself a hand
[1:45:02] reached down
[1:45:05] and picked him up
[1:45:08] amen i thought about that and i thought
[1:45:09] about in the book of acts in the third
[1:45:11] chapter of acts amen when peter and john
[1:45:14] went by the gate called beautiful and
[1:45:16] there was a man laying there begging
[1:45:18] arms and he said peter said silver and
[1:45:20] gold have a number such as a hat
[1:45:22] such as we have we give unto thee in the
[1:45:24] name of jesus christ rise up and walk
[1:45:26] and the bible says amen that they lifted
[1:45:28] him up amen amen and he received
[1:45:31] strength amen in his in his feet is that
[1:45:34] right amen there had to be a power to
[1:45:37] lift him up let me just tell you church
[1:45:39] you might not have the strength to stand
[1:45:41] on your own this morning amen but i've
[1:45:43] got good news there's a power greater
[1:45:46] amen than what you are and there's a
[1:45:48] hand god has got a hand this one it is
[1:45:50] not short
[1:45:54] he can reach down
[1:45:56] and lift you up
[1:46:08] he caught a vision
[1:46:11] caught a vision of the
[1:46:14] of the future what give brother branham
[1:46:16] the
[1:46:17] what give brother brown the courage
[1:46:20] the courage to to be able to
[1:46:23] to reach down could you imagine
[1:46:25] could you imagine i just want you to
[1:46:27] think about this
[1:46:29] could you imagine
[1:46:31] here's a pr here's a man standing before
[1:46:34] tens of thousands of people
[1:46:39] tens of thousands of people
[1:46:43] and and and without apology without
[1:46:46] hesitating at all
[1:46:48] he declares
[1:46:49] it's over
[1:46:51] the boy's healed
[1:46:55] church he didn't wait for the boy to
[1:46:56] stand up
[1:46:57] he didn't have to wait a minute to
[1:46:59] actually see it happen
[1:47:01] he had already seen it happen
[1:47:04] you understand what i'm saying he had
[1:47:06] already seen it happen he knew it was
[1:47:08] going to happen
[1:47:11] that's what brother brown said whenever
[1:47:12] they come to the place in finland
[1:47:15] and
[1:47:16] and they come to this place the side of
[1:47:18] the road there pulled over and they seen
[1:47:20] the scene set here's a little debt a boy
[1:47:22] laying dead on the on the road
[1:47:26] brother brown something about the scene
[1:47:28] caught his attention
[1:47:30] something about the scene
[1:47:32] and he said wait a minute he said
[1:47:34] there's something about this
[1:47:36] and he tells one of the brothers he said
[1:47:37] go get your bible
[1:47:39] he said look in the fly leaf of your
[1:47:41] bible he said there's something wrote
[1:47:42] about this somewhere they went and got
[1:47:44] the bible and began to read in the in
[1:47:46] the fly leaf of the bible amen they
[1:47:48] began to see amen exactly amen what had
[1:47:50] been prophesied and then brother brown
[1:47:52] said when they began to recognize where
[1:47:54] they were standing
[1:47:57] and they began to realize we're standing
[1:47:59] in a vision
[1:48:00] is that right amen this has already been
[1:48:02] seen we're standing in the vision you
[1:48:04] know what brother brown said he said you

[1:48:11] can't be stopped now
[1:48:13] amen line every devil and let me just
[1:48:15] say this amen the future was so clear
[1:48:19] amen the vision was so perfect
[1:48:23] amen that the prophet didn't have to
[1:48:25] wait to see the boy raise to declare it
[1:48:28] was going to happen
[1:48:30] amen he had a confidence why because he
[1:48:32] had already seen it
[1:48:35] hallelujah and you're thinking this word
[1:48:37] brother that's wonderful but why are you
[1:48:39] talking about somebody in africa and a
[1:48:41] boy in finland but let me just tell you
[1:48:43] this you have been seen in a vision
[1:48:48] your future is clear
[1:48:52] hallelujah there's going to be a rapture
[1:48:56] amen somebody is going to get a body

[1:49:01] resurrection

[1:49:07] i don't have to wait to feel it
[1:49:10] i don't have to wait to see it
[1:49:13] amen something has wrote about it in
[1:49:15] this bible amen and as i look in the
[1:49:18] word i'm beginning to realize i'm living
[1:49:20] in the vision
[1:49:23] and you can light every devil out of
[1:49:25] hell up
[1:49:27] you won't stop it now
[1:49:29] hallelujah amen it can't be stopped
[1:49:33] this bride won't be stopped
[1:49:36] this rapture won't be stopped
[1:49:39] hallelujah the prophets already saw us
[1:49:42] in the preview amen in the vision amen
[1:49:45] he saw a bride listen church he saw the
[1:49:48] church he saw him being led by a witch
[1:49:51] he saw him dancing to a rock and roll
[1:49:53] beat he saw him falling off into hell
[1:49:56] but that ain't the end of the vision
[1:50:00] because the bride must come again
[1:50:03] and the last one looked exactly like the
[1:50:05] first one
[1:50:07] and when that bride amen come again into
[1:50:10] view even as she was walking over
[1:50:12] christian soldier

[1:50:17] falling off into hell but what did he
[1:50:20] see he saw her going up
[1:50:24] hallelujah i said god has already saw us
[1:50:28] going up
[1:50:30] and if you can realize in this world
[1:50:31] you're living in the vision
[1:50:36] your future is clear
[1:50:41] let's stand our feet this morning
[1:50:46] let me just close with this
[1:50:49] as the prophet said
[1:50:53] probably said
[1:50:55] when he come back from that trip to
[1:50:56] africa from africa there
[1:50:59] really andrew
[1:51:00] if you remember because he got in some
[1:51:02] trouble you know because
[1:51:03] he'd listen to men and there's some
[1:51:06] things that had taken place and
[1:51:08] brother brown was very sick
[1:51:11] he said it seemed like that
[1:51:13] heaven was just shut off to him
[1:51:17] and
[1:51:18] in that
[1:51:22] brother branham said that
[1:51:25] he was sitting in the room one night
[1:51:30] and he was thinking about his future
[1:51:33] that's what brother brown said the way
[1:51:34] he described he said was thinking about
[1:51:35] his future
[1:51:37] and as he said he said
[1:51:40] even he was this is the kind of thoughts
[1:51:42] he was having if you can imagine
[1:51:44] talking about a prophet of god
[1:51:48] i'm thinking about these things and he
[1:51:50] said
[1:51:53] he said well i guess this is the end of
[1:51:55] my ministry
[1:51:57] i guess it's all over now
[1:52:00] he's so sick and you know the
[1:52:02] it seemed like the lord wouldn't hear
[1:52:04] his prayers and
[1:52:06] he said i guess this is the end
[1:52:08] and he even had this thought in one
[1:52:09] place he said it like this he said
[1:52:11] he said well i guess that would be a
[1:52:13] good meeting to end on like because of
[1:52:15] the great supernatural things that god
[1:52:17] had done in there in africa and all the
[1:52:19] great healings and miracles had taken
[1:52:21] place
[1:52:22] and he said
[1:52:23] but as he was thinking on that
[1:52:26] brother brown said for the first time
[1:52:29] in months and months
[1:52:32] he said i felt that presence come into
[1:52:33] the room
[1:52:37] that voice began to speak to me says and
[1:52:39] as you were thinking on your
[1:52:42] future brother branham i don't fully
[1:52:45] understand what what he saw but he saw
[1:52:48] like some paper brother describing like
[1:52:50] typewriter paper he said begin to fold
[1:52:52] out he said then it just began to go all
[1:52:54] the way up into the
[1:52:56] heavens and the voice spoke to him and
[1:52:59] said
[1:53:00] your future is clear
[1:53:03] and god showed him this is not the end
[1:53:10] this is not your end
[1:53:13] your future is clear
[1:53:17] let me just encourage you with this and
[1:53:20] and leaving this morning
[1:53:22] amen you might be say you may be sitting
[1:53:23] here and maybe there's somebody here i
[1:53:25] don't know but maybe there's somebody
[1:53:26] here said i ain't felt that i ain't
[1:53:29] seems like the heavens is blocked off
[1:53:31] maybe you feel like i failed god and
[1:53:34] maybe you have
[1:53:36] i mean brother branham had made a
[1:53:37] mistake
[1:53:39] he i'm not saying that to belittle the
[1:53:41] prophet in any kind of way
[1:53:42] but he hadn't made a mistake
[1:53:45] it seemed like the heavens was shut off
[1:53:46] and you may be sitting here think man i
[1:53:48] made a great mistake i failed the lord
[1:53:50] and maybe you did fail god
[1:53:54] and maybe you you're getting a place in
[1:53:55] the and say because satan's an
[1:53:57] opportunist
[1:53:59] and he loves to take advantage of every
[1:54:01] situation
[1:54:03] he'll get you in the moments where you
[1:54:04] feel like you're a failure and you feel
[1:54:06] like you've failed god and
[1:54:08] and and and heaven is shut off from you
[1:54:12] and when and and when god is silent
[1:54:15] brother brown said that's when the devil
[1:54:16] starts talking
[1:54:21] but maybe this morning
[1:54:23] for the first time in a long time
[1:54:27] you could just feel the presence of the
[1:54:28] lord
[1:54:30] just come sweeping in the room
[1:54:33] what would it mean to you
[1:54:35] if you could just hear that voice say

[1:54:43] your future is clear
[1:54:46] this is not your end
[1:54:50] church i want you to know we have not

[1:55:07] is we're standing on the threshold of it
[1:55:12] what the prophets and the in the in the
[1:55:14] sages of old long to see
