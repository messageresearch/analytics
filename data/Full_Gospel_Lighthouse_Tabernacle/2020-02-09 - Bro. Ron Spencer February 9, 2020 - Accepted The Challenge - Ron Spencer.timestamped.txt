[0:06] I certainly love you with all my heart
[0:11] I'd like to just take a couple of
[0:13] moments before before we goes too much
[0:16] farther we have a couple things to share
[0:18] with you maybe maybe I just share where
[0:24] we're at my family can help me if I I
[0:28] need help over the last few weeks we
[0:35] have found out some very difficult
[0:36] information that we have not shared with
[0:39] many people but I was shared with you as
[0:41] an audience just now we would we have
[0:45] did dr. buck Walker I just spoke to him
[0:49] this week one of those some manny ISM
[0:52] and I so thank him and thank him for
[0:57] being very proactive and we we have we
[1:04] have did a two CT scans and we've did a
[1:07] PET scan and we've just now been ordered
[1:12] to do an MRI which we did did you get a
[1:16] name
[1:21] for those that don't know we we knew for
[1:25] a few months that we were coming up
[1:27] against something we didn't know what it
[1:29] was and December in December the day
[1:33] before Christmas I believe it was let me
[1:36] just take you back December the 22nd the
[1:39] Lord spoke to us and said if you'll
[1:42] trust me I guess you're like never
[1:45] before and so and so we have been having
[1:51] some health issues since about the
[1:53] middle of last summer and we kept that
[1:56] very private Connie I think is the only
[1:58] one that actually knew that and we
[2:01] conducted the meetings that we conducted
[2:03] and we struggled very privately and we
[2:07] you know you just do what you got to do
[2:10] and so and so the day before Christmas
[2:13] brother doctor I call him brother as
[2:16] well dr. buck Walter asked me to begin
[2:19] some tests and he he shared with me and
[2:23] these were his words he said we're
[2:25] getting ready to send you down a long
[2:26] dark road and so we did one CT scan and
[2:31] we actually went away as a family and I
[2:34] found out in Pigeon Forge that I had
[2:36] tumor on my left my left lung at that
[2:41] point that's what they knew we knew that
[2:44] we already had some issues with my
[2:45] stomach and colon area and and so we
[2:51] found that out at Pigeon Forge as a
[2:54] family we try to go away a little bit to
[2:57] try to relieve some stress and so then
[3:01] then we went to brother Bissell's and
[3:04] sister Connie actually got a ticket to
[3:06] go to brother biscuits with us and the
[3:08] Lord shirt just shined down his grace
[3:11] and mercy they actually was able to get
[3:14] her on the same flights setting
[3:16] literally beside of me every flight and
[3:19] that was just incredible great to me
[3:22] that was one of the greatest meetings
[3:23] that I've ever been a part of it to
[3:25] preach and gonna deliver it's a Liberty
[3:28] like never before
[3:30] we came back on Tuesday and on Wednesday
[3:33] we did the second CT scan which would
[3:36] only confirm what the first CT scan
[3:39] confirmed and then and then they asked
[3:42] for us to do a biopsy the lymph node and
[3:45] brother Nathanael Natan went with us and
[3:49] and Holmes he went actually in the into
[3:52] the the room with us and the surgical
[3:54] room and they did the biopsy and I'd
[3:57] like to thank him for being a buddy and
[3:59] a friend to this entire product project
[4:02] and an eye on on what's going on and we
[4:06] got news that later that week that we
[4:08] had cancer and so and then and then then
[4:15] we began to have some more issues as as
[4:17] time would arise and so this last week
[4:20] we have did labs and then we did an MRI
[4:23] on Friday and because of some other
[4:27] things are beginning to show up and so
[4:31] so tomorrow they're going to do a lung
[4:34] biopsy there is a there is a the lungs
[4:41] has several masses in them and and and
[4:46] there's one of them that is extremely
[4:48] active and and it says it's doubled in
[4:52] size since they have seen me so that's
[4:56] in three weeks it's actually doubled and
[4:59] so they know what it is they know it's
[5:01] cancer but they need to find out what
[5:03] type of cancer that it is and so I just
[5:08] wanna I just want to share some things
[5:10] with you you said well brother on that's
[5:13] in the lungs and the doctor told me the
[5:16] other day he said your lungs are perfect
[5:33] he said this cancer that has came from
[5:37] somewhere else in your body has came and
[5:40] has master ties into your lungs he said
[5:43] your lungs are perfect
[5:44] he said it's it's it's actually invaded
[5:48] to the lungs and so they thanked God for
[5:51] perfect lungs and I believe that their
[5:55] squatter will have to leave I I've taken
[6:02] a bit of criticism just sharing some of
[6:05] these things some people say well you're
[6:10] speaking the devil's language well well
[6:13] let me just say this to you these
[6:17] doctors have a great care that I get
[6:20] better and I would like to know what I
[6:24] have and you can call it lyin vanities
[6:29] whatever you want to but that thing is
[6:32] trying to take my life and we believe
[6:36] that we have another report and God's
[6:39] greater than cancer
[6:41] [Applause]
[6:43] [Music]
[6:45] [Applause]
[6:45] [Music]
[6:46] [Applause]
[6:50] [Music]
[6:56] just to just to let you know our family
[7:01] will be involved with that tomorrow and
[7:03] and we apologize that we hope we hope
[7:06] we're not deer licking duties but just a
[7:10] lot of going on with our family here
[7:12] just now and so if you're not your hands
[7:15] not getting held or or you're not
[7:18] getting a special phone call if you can
[7:20] just give us a little space we sure
[7:23] would appreciate that
[7:24] amen I was able to see brother Joe in
[7:27] the hospital this week and he said in
[7:30] here and I hope he's doing better and to
[7:32] get that new pair of shoes so we just
[7:36] were just praying for brother Joe that
[7:38] God would be with him also Sharon
[7:41] shifflett that's been in the hospital we
[7:43] were able to see her and I just
[7:45] addressed with them and coming in the
[7:48] next a little bit I won't be able to go
[7:50] to hospitals and that's for obvious
[7:52] reasons other than for myself because of
[7:54] and you'll see me begin to work gloves
[7:57] in a few days and so it's because
[7:59] because they're wanting to treat me so
[8:01] and so I've you know I've had people
[8:05] tell me don't take the treatments or
[8:07] whatever you know but I I just have to
[8:09] tell you brother branham had great
[8:11] doctors
[8:14] and he told us to go to the doctors and
[8:16] take the medicine and and believe the
[8:19] Lord and and so we we're just we would
[8:22] appreciate your your prayers with us on
[8:25] this and and you you may not might know
[8:28] better how to pray now but that will
[8:31] take place the surgery we take place
[8:33] tomorrow I think it's between two three
[8:35] and a four-hour surgery I could be in
[8:37] the hospital tomorrow or the next day or
[8:40] whatever depending on how that goes and
[8:42] so Connie will Connie will somebody will
[8:45] get information out as we go

[9:03] to repeat it nobody's got the N word you

[9:19] them but I can't get to a mall and I
[9:21] can't get to all the phone calls and I'm

[10:47] hidden God good getting done good
[10:51] I asked brother Joe Greene this week and
[10:57] I think he's watching even right now
[10:59] I asked brother Joe Greene this week if
[11:01] he would go back and get the clip it's
[11:06] an audio clip it's not video an audio
[11:11] clip of when brother Bisco prayed and I
[11:14] received 100% deliverance you see I had
[11:20] lungs that were burned and being burned
[11:24] they they they had been scarred and so I
[11:28] was suffering with with scarred lungs
[11:31] and I had suffered since the accident in
[11:34] the oh seven and then in August the 22nd
[11:38] I had preached the week before at
[11:40] brother Bissell's and it just wore me
[11:42] slap out and I just really needed a
[11:45] healing touch it was in this meeting and
[11:48] we're going to make that available to
[11:50] you online that you can listen to it in
[11:52] this meeting brother Briscoe preaches on
[11:55] and I don't know if the title but he
[11:57] preaches on bringing order out of chaos
[11:59] and so brother Bissell praise of prayer
[12:04] and I'm going to share that with you if
[12:07] we can just now and he prays a prayer
[12:13] and in that prayer I stood up beside of
[12:16] a pillar and God it was like a great
[12:21] vacuum that came down over top of me and
[12:23] it was a like a push of air came down
[12:26] into my lungs and 100% healed my lungs
[12:33] and through this process of time in each
[12:39] stage of all of this and just to answer
[12:43] a couple of questions here people say
[12:46] well it's scar tissue or this or that
[12:48] it's not one bit of scar tissue there
[13:03] and here's what I want to say if God
[13:07] could heal him once
[13:10] and there not be one bit of scar tissue
[13:14] one bit of calcium deposit Sangha

[21:07] want to I want to just square up with
[21:10] every one of you I've been in some tough
[21:13] spots in life they told this body that
[21:17] it would never walk again
[21:20] they told this body it would never walk
[21:23] again they wanted to harvest the organs
[21:29] from this body they said that was brain
[21:34] dead so he's still God
[21:42] [Applause]
[21:50] I'd like to just speak for a bit on
[21:55] accepted the challenge I'm gonna have a
[22:00] challenge we accept when two great
[22:06] champions come to a certain spot one can
[22:10] make a lot of boast and he can stand and
[22:13] make most all day long but somebody
[22:18] accepts the challenge Jesus accepted the
[22:26] challenge
[22:29] David accepted the challenge you're
[22:34] learning just a little bit that brother
[22:35] branham accepted the challenge will you
[22:41] accept it we're gonna come quite a long
[22:47] ways were you accepted Jesus praise in
[22:53] Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9 after this
[22:56] manner therefore pray he a Father which
[23:00] art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy
[23:03] kingdom come thy will be done in earth
[23:07] as it is in heaven give us this day our
[23:10] daily bread and forgive us our debts as
[23:13] we forgive our debtors and lead us not
[23:16] into temptation but deliver us from evil
[23:20] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[23:22] and the glory forever amen Luke chapter
[23:27] 9 and verse 28 Lewton 9 and 28 very
[23:35] important portion of Scripture and it
[23:39] came to pass about an eight days after
[23:42] these sayings he took Peter and John and
[23:47] James and went up into the mountain to
[23:49] pray and as he prayed the fashion of his
[23:53] countenance was altered and his raiment
[23:56] was white and glistening and behold
[24:00] there talked with him too
[24:02] men which were Moses and Elias I heard
[24:06] brother branham say he said isn't it
[24:08] interesting that that Peter James and
[24:11] John knew who they were
[24:13] yeah they had lived thousand two years
[24:17] before but here they're standing there
[24:21] and they knew who they were what a
[24:27] conference this was who appeared in
[24:30] glory now they've got something to say
[24:33] to Jesus and spank of his decease which
[24:39] he should accomplish at Jerusalem quite
[24:44] a conference they're going to talk about
[24:46] Calvary they're going to talk about the
[24:49] preparation how are they going to do it
[24:51] take him back to the word take him back
[24:55] to the word but Peter and they that were
[25:03] with him were heavy with sleep and they
[25:05] they were await and they saw his glory
[25:07] and two men that stood with him and it
[25:09] came to pass as they departed from him
[25:12] Peter said unto Jesus master it is good
[25:15] for us to be here let us make three
[25:17] Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses
[25:20] of one for Elias not knowing what he
[25:22] said while he does spank there came a
[25:26] cloud and overshadowed them and they
[25:28] feared as they entered into the cloud
[25:31] and there came a voice out of the cloud
[25:33] saying this is my beloved son hear him a
[25:42] man Matthew chapter 26 and verse 36
[25:47] forgive me for having you standing
[25:49] I'll be I'll be standing quite a bit
[25:52] then cometh Jesus with them into a place
[25:55] called Gethsemane and and set the
[25:59] disciples since he here while I go and
[26:04] pray yonder and he took with him Peter
[26:07] and the two sons of Zebedee and began to
[26:09] be sorrowful and very heavy
[26:11] then said he unto them my soul is
[26:14] exceedingly sorrowful even unto death
[26:17] are you here and watch with me and he
[26:20] went a little further and he fell on his
[26:22] face and prayed
[26:23] notice what he prayed o my father if it
[26:29] be possible let this cup pass from me
[26:33] nevertheless not as I will but as
[26:39] thought will and he cometh unto the
[26:43] disciples and finding them asleep and
[26:45] said unto Peter what could you not watch
[26:48] with me one hour watching pray that you
[26:51] enter not into temptation the spirit
[26:53] indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
[26:55] and he went away again the second time
[26:58] and prayed saying O my father if this
[27:00] cup might not pass away from me except I
[27:03] drink it thy will be done and it came
[27:07] and found him asleep for their eyes were
[27:09] heavy and he left them and went away
[27:12] again and prayed the third time saying
[27:14] the same words then coming to his
[27:17] disciples and saith unto them sleep on
[27:20] now take your rest behold the hour is at
[27:23] hand the Son of Man is betrayed into the
[27:26] hands of sinners let us rise and let us
[27:30] be going behold it he is at hand that
[27:35] Duff betrayed me you may be seated this
[27:39] evening
[27:59] when David was walking off of the hill
[28:03] and he had accepted the challenge
[28:07] he had only just a little while
[28:09] previously just only moments before step
[28:14] before Saul and the men that were there
[28:17] and begin to talk to them about that God
[28:22] was with him and he began to explain to
[28:26] them it wasn't as Weil that he wanted to
[28:29] do this but God's with him and he began
[28:34] to testify sometimes we testify to even
[28:38] create an atmosphere of faith and here
[28:41] was a backslidden king that the
[28:44] anointing had left him here was a people
[28:48] that were if they lose the battle they
[28:51] will be enslaved to another nation their
[28:53] homes will be theirs their families
[28:55] won't be theirs
[28:56] the nation won't be theirs if they lose
[29:00] this battle it'll never be the same in
[29:04] this land and here is a champion of
[29:08] champions that is standing over there
[29:10] you and I have the luxury to stand on
[29:13] this side and see it as a great epic
[29:16] battle to which God won but if you were
[29:19] sitting in the trenches if it was your
[29:23] family at home and if in a few hours you
[29:27] were going to be one way another
[29:28] liberated or captive the banking
[29:33] accounts were no longer going to be
[29:35] yours the the the housing is no longer
[29:38] going to be yours the government that
[29:41] you are so enjoying is no longer going
[29:44] to be yours and here a boy not a great
[29:51] big muscular man that has been fought
[29:55] incredible battles but here a boy has
[29:58] showed up that has a history that he has
[30:02] been anointed by the prophet of God God
[30:05] has chosen him to the
[30:07] to be king now in his history he has
[30:12] been a songwriter and he has been under
[30:14] the anointings of worship and praise and
[30:17] he knew what the presence of God was on
[30:20] a couple of different occasions on a
[30:23] lion would come to try to destroy the
[30:26] sheep that was in the field and God
[30:30] would give him the anointing to destroy
[30:34] that life on another occasion a bear
[30:37] came to take those innocent sheep and
[30:41] the anointing of God came upon him and
[30:45] he slew that bear from one trial to
[30:52] another trial to another trial he
[30:55] learned that God is a champion God is a
[31:00] man of war now when he presents himself
[31:08] to the to the men there on the field and
[31:11] he hears this this man echo his thoughts
[31:15] out screaming blasphemous things down
[31:19] over the hill as he screaming he's
[31:22] streaming that them worship God is you
[31:24] to have a Living God and making all
[31:26] manner of fun of them send me one man
[31:30] that will come and fight me just send me
[31:34] one makes the negotiation you win will
[31:38] serve you we win you serve us the
[31:42] challenge was made it can make that
[31:45] challenge forever
[31:46] if nobody accepted and Goliath was in
[31:52] good shape until somebody was anointed
[31:55] for the challenge of the hour
[31:59] Laodicea can raise enrage and and woo
[32:04] and destroy religion of the world but
[32:07] God sent a message that accepted the
[32:11] challenge of the world st. Matty's going
[32:14] to live it somebody's going to overcome
[32:18] Laodicea David shared with with Saul
[32:32] that evening that God was with him Saul
[32:38] told him about his armor and he didn't
[32:41] want no part of that brother Brandon
[32:44] would equate that to some seminary
[32:47] teaches something that wasn't proved let
[32:51] me just say this to you this message is
[32:53] proved and I'd like to say here in stand
[32:59] as a representative to not standing in
[33:02] the battle that I'm standing in I'm
[33:05] standing in the battle in the land of a
[33:09] million doctors everybody's got an
[33:11] opinion
[33:14] everybody's got a thought everybody's
[33:17] got a word everybody's got a thought but
[33:20] there's as Roosevelt said you're the man
[33:23] in the middle you're the man in the
[33:26] arena it's between you and God are you
[33:31] with me now there can be a lot of
[33:33] sympathizers and a lot of opposes and a
[33:36] lot of critics but you're the man in the
[33:38] middle you're the man that's got to
[33:41] accept the challenge when David walked
[33:54] off of the hill all the hopes of that
[33:59] nation was now on a boy
[34:03] I want that to soak in all the hopes of
[34:13] that nation was on a boy you better know
[34:25] that God you better know that God only
[34:33] just a little bit before though David's
[34:36] own brothers tried to intimidate him and
[34:39] to tell him to go home so just because
[34:44] you're family of the preachers don't
[34:46] mean you're believers are you with me
[34:54] let me just shake you just a little bit
[34:57] just because you walked you pop you
[34:59] don't make you a believer
[35:05] there's no rapture ticket just because
[35:08] you said here I want to just share my
[35:15] burden with you and I shared it with my
[35:20] family today from this point forward I'm
[35:26] only looking at eternal things and my
[35:29] focus is on the promise petty nonsense
[35:33] I'm not interested in petty nonsense I'm
[35:39] not interested in are you with me now
[35:42] but my opinion don't matter
[35:45] my thoughts don't matter I'm only
[35:49] interested in the promise
[35:55] whether on did you watch the state of
[35:58] the union of they not interested they
[36:04] can rip speeches all they want to it
[36:07] only shows that this nation is not
[36:10] having a revival and there's bombs thats
[36:15] hanging waiting on it so don't put your
[36:22] trust in this flag don't put your trust
[36:29] in it's military our Chinese believers -
[36:35] not are housed in homes that can't go
[36:39] out into the street and one of our
[36:43] believers spit $300 of us money to be
[36:47] able to get enough food for two days
[36:50] they are proclaiming a promise that that
[36:53] plague will not come neither home most
[36:58] of them will lose everything they've got
[37:00] to survive but when it comes down to the
[37:05] end of it all if you've got God you've
[37:08] got everything
[37:20] these plagues are coming it's promised
[37:23] that they're coming they're promised to
[37:27] come will it stay in China no sir but
[37:31] you know as long as it's all the way
[37:33] over there
[37:34] it don't seem to bother over when we can
[37:40] hear of tragedy and other places you
[37:43] know it so you know you feel sorry for
[37:45] him until it gets to your house are you
[37:51] ask me that's just honest facts Adam
[38:08] fell and every every man woman boy and
[38:12] girl fell under him the earth fell lions
[38:20] that were pets are now predators birds
[38:24] that were once tame and docile are now
[38:28] predators and wild actually the the sky
[38:33] now becomes that rage against one
[38:36] another the seasons begin to struggle
[38:39] with one another here just in the last
[38:41] couple of days five tornadoes landed
[38:44] just above us here destroying the homes
[38:47] and destroying communities that wouldn't
[38:52] like that in the Garden of Eden sin came
[38:57] sin came because of evens fall it caused
[39:03] every baby that's born dead to be
[39:05] attributed to that sin every adulterous
[39:09] act that retained them rising of
[39:12] civilization and all kinds of education
[39:15] and scientific ability all goes back on
[39:18] the
[39:19] hands of Eve's for God could have wiped
[39:24] away the world of all mankind but Noah
[39:28] found grace in the eyes of God are you
[39:32] with me God sent his prophets and on the
[39:36] scene got depth lip to ear to a prophet
[39:39] now let me just let me just share this
[39:42] with you God his one of his first
[39:43] prophets was a man named Abraham who
[39:46] would become the father of his faith God
[39:49] promised him that I'm going to give you
[39:51] a son and that sons going to come by
[39:54] Sarah and the longer that he lived the
[39:58] more impossible it looked like that it
[40:02] would take place sometimes time becomes
[40:07] our worst enemy strength as it begins to
[40:11] deplete becomes our worst enemy because
[40:15] reasoning begins to get in and doubt
[40:18] begins to get in but Abraham continued
[40:22] to look at the promise and he believed
[40:25] God that God was more than able to raise
[40:30] him up and give him a son through Sarah
[40:36] he was 65 years old as a younger man
[40:39] when he begins to be hearing these
[40:41] things and 75 and and he begins to hear
[40:45] these things that God's going to give
[40:47] him a son and God begins to make
[40:48] covenants and promises with him he
[40:50] constantly looks at the promise but he
[40:54] couldn't produce it understand he
[40:58] couldn't produce it but God Himself
[41:01] would impute a portion of himself inside
[41:05] of Abraham
[41:08] God would come to Abraham sitting in a
[41:11] tent and then that tent he would set on
[41:16] the outside and look at Abraham in the
[41:19] eyes we would know and just kind of just
[41:23] just just putting some things together
[41:25] we would know that Abraham has spoke
[41:28] with this King because he recognized his
[41:31] voice he recognized his presence he
[41:35] recognized his promises and he knew that
[41:38] this was God and he knew that God knew
[41:42] his name and he knew his name change
[41:45] that he had changed him from April to
[41:47] Abraham he had changed Sarah from Sarah
[41:50] - Sarah put in an H putting a portion of
[41:54] his ownself in there Nance as Romans
[41:59] would say it was a tribute attend to him
[42:02] it was imputed unto him Abraham could
[42:07] not produce the promise but God himself
[42:10] in them could produce the promise just
[42:16] putting some things together so stay
[42:17] very with me just now Abraham we would
[42:21] come to find out that though he'd be a
[42:23] hundred years old and it looked totally
[42:26] impossible God specializes in
[42:30] impossibilities did you hear that God
[42:38] specializes in impossibilities and he
[42:46] took a hundred year old man and made him
[42:51] young again
[42:53] he took a 90 year old woman and made her
[42:57] such a beautiful woman until a king
[43:00] would water for a wife are you with me
[43:06] that's my god I'd like to quickly jump
[43:20] to Jesus prays and he teaches us how to
[43:26] pray there's God telling us how to
[43:31] communicate with him and how to have
[43:34] fellowship with him not to a priest not
[43:39] through your favorite preacher but you
[43:43] can talk lip to ear to God God hears
[43:46] your prayer and sometimes you pray and
[43:50] great faith like a mighty champion and
[43:53] then there's days that you pray help me
[43:59] sometimes you act like Superman
[44:01] sometimes you act like Clark Kent
[44:07] sometimes you're strong and you can
[44:09] speak a world into existence there's
[44:11] other days you're not even control of
[44:13] your own faculties but he's still God
[44:20] he's still God Jesus would get weary and
[44:31] lay in a boat and because could be so
[44:35] wore out and so tired from the meetings
[44:39] until he would lay there and a star
[44:42] would come and literally almost
[44:44] destroyed the whole atmosphere and
[44:47] literally Satan wanted to destroy the
[44:50] whole thing and they got all all uptight
[44:53] and in a situation but they needed to
[44:56] remember who was in the boat sometimes
[45:00] we need to remember we needed to wake
[45:03] Jesus
[45:05] [Applause]
[45:19] miracles we could talk about Zacchaeus
[45:22] sitting in a tree laughs in a tube
[45:28] Leopards
[45:29] we could talk about the woman at the
[45:31] well he had to answer for every
[45:36] situation he would walk to a pool that
[45:42] the angel would come down and literally
[45:44] thousands of people we'd be gathered at
[45:47] that pool waiting for the angel to
[45:50] trouble the water and Jesus with all of
[45:53] that power went to one man you know
[45:59] sometimes you go to a service and you
[46:01] think well you know nobody's getting
[46:05] anything what about you what about you
[46:10] well brother on nobody else seems to be
[46:13] getting into it what about you I'll be
[46:17] honest with you I'm here I'm here
[46:19] needing a touch from God tonight
[46:30] I could pull back in a pity Clark pity
[46:35] corner pull into a cave and say I'm just
[46:38] gonna set this all out but listen I'm
[46:41] missing a declaration every time the
[46:44] opportunity is I'm preaching and trying
[46:47] to take this body into the atmosphere of
[46:50] the Holy Ghost and it's that Holy Ghost
[46:54] that'll heal this bike
[47:09] hallelujah hello I'd like to say this at
[47:20] this point I don't know how people do it
[47:23] without Jesus the difficult things that
[47:28] I have heard over the last three weeks I
[47:30] haven't shared all of it with you but
[47:32] they're difficult to call things that
[47:33] I've heard over the last three weeks
[47:36] it's difficult for a man and even in my
[47:39] spot
[47:40] I cannot imagine hearing those same
[47:43] things without Jesus I can't imagine not
[47:48] having the friends around the world that
[47:53] are praying and have a special prayer
[47:55] brother George Quinn just told me just a
[47:58] few minutes ago he said this week I
[48:00] walked and prayed all night long for you
[48:06] hallelujah do you think God's not going
[48:08] to hear that prayer
[48:18] hello now let me just say we're living
[48:24] in an hour not just for my healing not
[48:28] just for others healing but we're in an
[48:31] hour of expectation for a resurrection
[48:34] to happen this is our 4 rapture so we've
[48:38] got to have faith for more than just
[48:40] cancer to be destroyed our God is a
[48:44] cancer killer our God is bigger than
[48:50] every cancer devil in the world if you
[48:54] will remember in the cave when brother
[48:56] Branham met beings of the Lord
[48:58] it wasn't the angel that brought up
[49:00] cancer it was brother Branham that
[49:06] brought up cancer because it was the
[49:09] prevailing sickness of our day and the
[49:14] angel said not even cancer
[49:18] so to God cancer is nothing
[49:23] [Applause]
[49:37] now let me just say this to you
[49:40] in all of this in all of these thoughts
[49:44] here Jesus is pressing his way and he is
[49:48] the word looking at the word and the
[49:53] word says I will not suffer my Holy One
[49:57] to see corruption
[50:00] so he can read sums 22 and Psalms 23 and
[50:05] Psalms 24 25 26 27 and she prophetically
[50:12] what the word says about him how much
[50:16] more can we look at 1st Thessalonians
[50:18] chapter 4 and revelations 10 1 2 7 2 8
[50:23] all the way through to revelations 21 I
[50:26] see a new heaven and I see a new earth
[50:30] and realize we're part of the prophecy
[50:35] so God has provided for tomorrow he's
[50:41] not just provided for today he's
[50:44] provided for tomorrow
[50:47] [Applause]
[50:59] now just to give you an example two
[51:03] years before brother Branham told his
[51:05] audience about a boy in Finland God was
[51:11] getting it ready and then the day that
[51:15] it happened but the random actually
[51:17] walks away from that scene three times
[51:19] and looks back in the angel tells him to
[51:23] go look at it and then just before it
[51:25] happens he said now if this boy's not
[51:26] off of the ground in five minutes you
[51:30] called me a false prophet and that boy
[51:34] that his bones are sticking through his
[51:36] skin he prays over that boy and in just
[51:44] a few moments that boy wasn't just fully
[51:47] back together but he was standing
[51:49] totally well
[51:52] and there was such a faith that at the
[51:56] next meeting before brother branham ever
[51:58] got to the pulpit 12 rows of chairs in
[52:01] wheelchairs and clots were healed as he
[52:05] walked in come on Church it looked like
[52:21] all humanity was losing the race if
[52:25] Jesus didn't accomplish the plan if
[52:29] Jesus calls out to the Angels to deliver
[52:32] him we would be lost if Jesus would back
[52:38] up and and not go fully through the
[52:41] cross and through the beating we would
[52:44] not be able to be healed but being
[52:49] surrendered he allowed them to beat him
[52:52] like no other human being with the power
[52:57] oh brother on but I've seen people with
[53:00] a lot of power you've never seen one
[53:02] like Jesus Jesus had the power to call
[53:06] 10,000 angels to set him free but he had
[53:10] power did surrender his body under the
[53:13] cruelty of Rome to be beat like no other
[53:17] human being because you and I would need
[53:20] to be healed
[53:21] [Applause]
[53:22] [Music]
[53:32] you see we needed a redemption we needed
[53:36] more than just some good story we needed
[53:41] the life of God in the Old Testament
[53:44] they had the blood of bulls and goats
[53:45] but that didn't change the nature of the
[53:48] human being we needed God to come live
[53:52] on the inside of us many of us would
[53:56] make good religious people shed in a
[53:58] church but we need more than religion we
[54:03] need to be more than actors
[54:05] we need that God to live on the inside
[54:09] of us and purify our lives for the run
[54:21] but cancer there was a worse than cancer
[54:24] lived here at one time there was an old
[54:30] man that lived here one time that was
[54:32] taking me to hell he had all different
[54:38] kinds of last and all kind of desires
[54:40] and that man that King was taking me
[54:45] toward hell I'd say that every person in
[54:53] this building had that King living in
[54:55] the heart now let me just say write an
[55:01] offense as a dangerous spot to sit in
[55:05] church on Sunday and to be a complete
[55:07] different person on Tuesday it tells you
[55:09] the wrong king is sitting on your heart
[55:12] if you have to have two wardrobes to
[55:15] dress
[55:17] [Music]
[55:19] two different kind of makeup sinners to
[55:22] dress to different kind of music to
[55:26] listen to come on help me preach
[55:40] we can sing amazing grace here you go
[55:43] out and get in the car listen to some
[55:45] hunky punk can rien bones that you can't
[55:51] even understand or some Chinese nonsense
[55:54] or some disser that that's that's right
[55:57] out of the pit of hell it shows you're
[55:59] filthy it shows you that you're on your
[56:02] way to hell don't tell me about your
[56:12] depression when you're feeding it don't
[56:17] complain to me about being 400 pounds
[56:20] when you're feeding it uh-oh
[56:22] kind of dough nuts chocolates
[56:26] well I just can't get over my way quit
[56:28] feeding it
[56:38] I had children in my home you said I
[56:44] can't do nothing with my child you know
[56:47] little Johnny he's 12 years old he's got
[56:49] his own music cut it off
[56:51] tell him at that nonsense it's not in
[56:54] this house we don't watch that kind of
[56:57] stuff in this house get in here we don't
[57:02] listen to that kind of music in this car
[57:06] [Music]
[57:07] [Applause]
[57:22] now everything that can be shaken will
[57:24] be shaken
[57:29] so we've accepted the challenge to be an
[57:32] astronaut of this age and as we go along
[57:37] even preachers that are just kind of
[57:40] hanging around even for years that have
[57:45] protected themselves as some great
[57:48] leader or they have some wild doctrine
[57:52] or they're trying to pull people to
[57:54] themselves
[57:55] that'll be shook off this church its
[58:00] goal is project Jesus Christ the message
[58:04] of the hour if I die tomorrow
[58:08] Boris I want this message preached till
[58:11] the day of the rapture
[58:12] [Applause]
[58:52] well brother on I look down the road and
[58:55] they're doing this or they're doing
[58:57] matter they're watching these things or
[58:59] they're dressing that way don't matter I
[59:02] got my eyes on Jesus
[59:05] we're not message Baptists message
[59:08] Methodists we're not blenders with the
[59:13] world we have been called to come up
[59:15] ever
[59:16] [Applause]
[59:19] don't let the prophet of God's voice
[59:22] become a stranger to your home
[59:24] it has rapturing faith laid on the
[59:28] inside of it there is ZERO rapturing
[59:32] faith on NBC CBS ABC whatever zero
[59:37] that's just information to gather to get
[59:40] you through this temporal law but you
[59:42] feed on the body word of the son of man
[59:45] and it will do wonders for the character
[59:48] of your life to live in this dark evil
[59:52] age accept the challenge
[1:00:05] Jesus did not give up going toward Gaga
[1:00:09] this hill he did not let the critics and
[1:00:12] the scoffers to make fun of him he kept
[1:00:16] pressing he didn't have another peer now
[1:00:27] let me just drop something here Jesus
[1:00:30] didn't have another man on the earth
[1:00:32] with the same commission brother Branham
[1:00:37] didn't have another man on the earth
[1:00:39] with the same Commission he had some
[1:00:42] incredible men around him but they
[1:00:44] didn't have the Commission to carry the
[1:00:45] message of the hour we've never had
[1:00:50] another messenger vindicated like
[1:00:52] William Miriam pranam and I'll never be
[1:00:54] ashamed of that name he is our brother
[1:01:01] he's not God he made mistakes but God
[1:01:06] allowed him a channel to which we could
[1:01:10] see happen and the word may be revealed
[1:01:13] to where we could take a rap shot Jesus
[1:01:28] didn't pay any attention to his office
[1:01:30] he was bigger than them you have to do
[1:01:37] that as well sometimes you're going to
[1:01:40] have scoffers and have people make fun
[1:01:42] of you
[1:01:46] just stand your ground
[1:01:49] that's more than a gun law stand your
[1:01:52] ground Satan I don't have to put up with
[1:01:56] you saying that all had to put up with
[1:02:00] you I don't have to put up with you when
[1:02:05] time is a drug head on our bicycle was
[1:02:08] coming up my driveway he came by
[1:02:11] three-quarters up the wide driveway and
[1:02:13] we met him me and one of the boys here
[1:02:16] not gonna point him out one of the boys
[1:02:19] here met him with the machine with two
[1:02:20] machine guns

[1:02:30] it at the air tank at the bottom at the
[1:02:33] garage and the brother and the man told
[1:02:36] him said better be careful with that air
[1:02:38] tank to blow your bike up and he sort of
[1:02:40] did and he said who are them guys at the
[1:02:45] end of the road he said well that one
[1:02:47] Aversa preacher but you better be
[1:02:49] careful with it he'll shoot you well I

[1:03:02] and I've warned it you come up my
[1:03:07] driveway there's a lot of warning signs
[1:03:11] I'm not politically correct and I notice
[1:03:16] Huck
[1:03:17] and Vijay are not either when it comes
[1:03:24] to the Word of God let us warn the devil
[1:03:27] this is our ground this is our promised
[1:03:32] land and every promises not every
[1:03:39] scripture every verse every lawn
[1:03:43] it's mine
[1:03:45] [Applause]
[1:03:57] the scripture says I press toward the
[1:03:59] mark of the prize of the high calling of
[1:04:02] God in Christ Jesus
[1:04:05] the scripture says hear of God little
[1:04:08] children and have overcome them because
[1:04:10] greater is He that is in you than he
[1:04:13] that is in the world 2nd Corinthians
[1:04:17] three and five oh not that we are
[1:04:19] sufficient of herself to think anything
[1:04:22] as of ourselves but our sufficiency is
[1:04:30] of God Paul said it like this when God
[1:04:38] he had prayed that this thing would
[1:04:40] leave him thrust and God sent us back to
[1:04:44] him and he said unto me my grace is
[1:04:47] sufficient for thee for my strength is

[1:10:19] brother Ron if you find out tomorrow the
[1:10:22] cancer is all through your body what
[1:10:36] and an interesting situation happened
[1:10:39] this week when the MRI took place and I

[1:10:46] sister dolor she'll like this the
[1:10:49] girl-girl blunted him she's about like

[1:11:03] and we talked about she knew the
[1:11:06] situation she'd read the reports and she
[1:11:09] knew kind of what was going on and she
[1:11:12] asked me what kind of work that we did
[1:11:15] overseas and I just talked to her about
[1:11:17] what overseas was was and and then I
[1:11:19] laid in the MRI with that astronaut
[1:11:21] helmet on for for an hour and they did
[1:11:24] brain scans and for an hour and after it
[1:11:29] was all over with God gave me grace to
[1:11:31] lay dead still and after it was all over
[1:11:32] with she walked in and they pulled me
[1:11:35] out in and as she was unbolting me to

[1:12:17] a perfect God with a perfect heart keep
[1:12:23] a perfect promise by His perfect word
[1:12:28] which is sharper than a two-edged sword
[1:12:31] and a discerner of the thoughts of the
[1:12:35] heart
[1:12:36] what now notice these words we're coming
[1:12:41] now to perfection into perfection
[1:12:43] because the people has to come to this
[1:12:47] in order for a rapture that's what's
[1:12:52] holding it away right now is waiting for
[1:12:55] that church to come into a perfect
[1:12:58] raptured faith looking for it it means a
[1:13:03] lot of shaving down for me it means a
[1:13:05] lot for you but together we'll make it
[1:13:08] by the grace of color and it begins to
[1:13:12] sing and make comments and then he
[1:13:14] begins to pray the Great Physician now

[1:15:42] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:15:44] us the same yesterday today and forever
