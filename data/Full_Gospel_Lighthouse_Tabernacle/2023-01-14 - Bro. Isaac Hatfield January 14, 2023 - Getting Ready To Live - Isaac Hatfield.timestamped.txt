[1:00:37] Ezekiel 37.
[1:00:42] to be dismissed
[1:00:47] Ezekiel 37 and we want to read
[1:00:51] from verse 1.
[1:00:53] down through
[1:00:55] 14.
[1:00:58] amen
[1:01:01] it says
[1:01:03] the hand of the Lord was upon me and
[1:01:06] carried me out in the spirit of the Lord
[1:01:08] and set me down in the midst of the
[1:01:10] valley which was full of Bones
[1:01:12] and caused me to pass by them round
[1:01:14] about and behold there were very many in
[1:01:17] the open Valley and Lowell they were
[1:01:18] very dry
[1:01:19] and he said unto me son
[1:01:22] of man can these bones live and I
[1:01:25] answered O Lord God thou knowest again
[1:01:27] he said unto me prophesy upon these
[1:01:30] bones and say unto them oh ye Jai broke
[1:01:32] Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord thus
[1:01:35] saith the Lord God unto these bones
[1:01:37] behold I will cause breath to enter into
[1:01:39] you and you shall live and I will lay
[1:01:42] sinews upon you and will bring up flesh
[1:01:45] upon you and cover you with skin and put
[1:01:47] breath in you and ye shall live and ye
[1:01:49] shall know that I am the Lord
[1:01:51] so I prophesied as I was commanded and
[1:01:54] as I prophesied there was a noise
[1:01:56] and behold a shaking and the bones came
[1:01:58] together bone to his bone and when I
[1:02:00] beheld low the sinews and the flesh came
[1:02:03] up upon them and the skin covered them
[1:02:06] above but there was no breath in them
[1:02:09] then said he unto me prophesy unto the
[1:02:11] wind prophesy son of man and say to the
[1:02:13] wind thus saith the Lord God come from
[1:02:15] the Four Winds o breath and breathe upon
[1:02:18] these slain that they may live
[1:02:20] so I prophesied as he commanded me and
[1:02:23] the breath came into them and they lived
[1:02:24] and stood up upon their feet and
[1:02:26] exceeding great Army then he said unto
[1:02:28] me son and man these bones are the whole
[1:02:30] house of Israel behold they say our
[1:02:32] bones are dried and our hope is lost and
[1:02:34] we are cut off for our parts therefore
[1:02:37] prophesy and say unto them thus saith
[1:02:39] the Lord God behold o my people I will
[1:02:40] open your Graves and cause you to come
[1:02:42] up out of your Graves and bring you into
[1:02:45] the land of Israel and ye shall know
[1:02:46] that I am the Lord when I have opened
[1:02:48] your Graves o my people and brought you
[1:02:50] up out of your Graves and he said and
[1:02:53] shall put my spirit in you and ye shall
[1:02:56] live and I shall place you in your own
[1:02:58] land then shall you know that I the Lord
[1:03:01] have spoken it and performed it saith
[1:03:04] the Lord if we could bow our heads in a
[1:03:07] word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank
[1:03:09] you Lord for your grace and our lives we
[1:03:11] thank you for another time just to
[1:03:13] gather in your presence father we
[1:03:15] believe it's in your presence that
[1:03:16] there's life father where things can
[1:03:18] change Lord and we just invite you Lord
[1:03:21] the life Giver just to come by our way
[1:03:23] and just now father may you go down the
[1:03:25] Avenues of your children's hearts and
[1:03:27] just speak father Lord where no man
[1:03:29] could ever know father may you just
[1:03:31] discern the thoughts and intents of the
[1:03:33] heart and may you just bring a
[1:03:35] satisfying portion to each and every
[1:03:37] heart tonight father that they'd go away
[1:03:39] full of your joy and your peace and your
[1:03:42] satisfying power father Lord we're on
[1:03:45] able in our own selves to do any of
[1:03:46] these things but we surrender this
[1:03:48] service into your hands father that
[1:03:50] you'd use it for your glory in the name
[1:03:52] of Jesus Christ amen you may have your
[1:03:55] seats
[1:03:56] amen we could take a title out of that
[1:03:59] it would be getting ready to live
[1:04:01] and why because God said so you know in
[1:04:05] perilous times brother Brown said our
[1:04:07] comfort is God said so
[1:04:09] it's not it's not the news it's not the
[1:04:12] things of the world it's God said so the
[1:04:14] word is our comfort and God cared enough
[1:04:16] for you to send you a comforter he cared
[1:04:19] enough for you that he said I go away
[1:04:20] but I shall not leave you comfortless
[1:04:22] and he said he sent the same care that
[1:04:25] he cared for the people when he was here
[1:04:26] on the earth when he healed their sick
[1:04:28] when he raised him from the dead he sent
[1:04:30] that same comforter back to you that you
[1:04:32] would have the same care that he gave
[1:04:34] when he was here walking on this Earth
[1:04:36] that same care that same comforter and
[1:04:39] what a Grace in our lives and it's
[1:04:41] becoming of us to stay with that word
[1:04:43] you see nature is getting ready to live
[1:04:45] you can look outside and it's a winter
[1:04:48] condition because some intelligence
[1:04:50] caused the sap in those trees to go down
[1:04:52] in The Roots if you put a bucket of
[1:04:54] water out there it wouldn't do the same
[1:04:56] thing but there's some intelligence that
[1:04:58] caused that to preserve that life to
[1:05:01] keep it there predestinated until the
[1:05:03] right season to bring it back up in the
[1:05:06] springtime of the Year and that same
[1:05:07] intelligence watches over you and has
[1:05:10] preserved you that same intelligence
[1:05:12] brought you to that meeting tonight to
[1:05:14] this meeting that same intelligence
[1:05:16] knows when you lay down your head and
[1:05:17] those mind battles you grow through
[1:05:19] that's the same intelligence that hung
[1:05:21] the stars in space and and took that sap
[1:05:24] and put it in those roots and brings it
[1:05:26] up again it's the same intelligence you
[1:05:29] know you might have come in a winter
[1:05:30] condition tonight in the winter
[1:05:33] condition of this world outside it's
[1:05:36] cold and you can get what something's
[1:05:38] called seasonal depression or seasonal
[1:05:41] affective disorders what Mayo Clinic
[1:05:43] calls that which stands for sad you're
[1:05:45] just sad it just it gets dark at six
[1:05:47] o'clock you wake up and you're freezing
[1:05:49] because it's so cold outside you're just
[1:05:51] sad but there's a reassurance that
[1:05:53] spring is coming but if you come in a
[1:05:56] winter condition spiritually tonight we
[1:05:57] can say spring isn't coming but spring
[1:05:59] is here it's more than the day of the
[1:06:02] year but your beneficiaries of his
[1:06:03] resurrection we can celebrate it each
[1:06:06] and every day as Christians because
[1:06:07] Easter he took our sins upon him and
[1:06:10] when he died we died with him and when
[1:06:12] he rose we rose with him and he gave us
[1:06:14] the satisfaction that our soul has
[1:06:16] already lifted above the cares of the
[1:06:18] world
[1:06:19] brother Brandon said all that Winter's
[1:06:21] coldness of cold formal religion killed
[1:06:23] out there the nearing of the Son of God
[1:06:25] in these last days coming to the church
[1:06:27] restores it back to life again and he
[1:06:30] said the only way it can ever remain
[1:06:31] dead is let it lay in the wrong place
[1:06:34] but if it falls in the right place it's
[1:06:36] got to come back to life again so God
[1:06:39] let us fall in the right channel that's
[1:06:41] right for a restoration we can fall in a
[1:06:44] Channel of restoration tonight where a
[1:06:47] law of God says winter has to give up
[1:06:49] its grip to the that when the spring Sun
[1:06:52] Comes The Law of God's word says that
[1:06:55] sun has to cause winter to give up its
[1:06:57] grip it has to release and let way for
[1:07:00] that spring sun to bring life again to
[1:07:03] bring restoration restoration and that
[1:07:05] sun forces that life out of that seed
[1:07:07] when you put your life under this
[1:07:09] message if there's a gene seed in there
[1:07:11] that son will force the life out of that
[1:07:13] seed it'll make the real you come forth
[1:07:16] show you who you really are show you who
[1:07:18] you always have been in the mind of God
[1:07:20] that's what God's law says and it will
[1:07:23] only Force the life out of that seed it
[1:07:25] didn't come to raise life out of the
[1:07:27] dirt or out of that rock but somewhere
[1:07:29] in that dirt they're surrounding a
[1:07:31] Gene's seed and that's what that son
[1:07:33] came to bring forth life out of this
[1:07:35] message isn't for everyone but it's for
[1:07:37] you the bride the believer because there
[1:07:39] was a seed in the little humble piece of
[1:07:42] dirt somewhere that the law of God said
[1:07:43] when that Sun Passes over it it will
[1:07:46] revive again it will resurrect again the
[1:07:49] law of God he sent it with his word to
[1:07:52] see it through he sent his law with his
[1:07:54] word to see it through a law life to see
[1:07:57] that that word would come to pass
[1:08:00] oh the world is getting ready to live
[1:08:02] they say we're just getting ready to
[1:08:04] live nothing like that could happen now
[1:08:06] nothing of that destruction could happen
[1:08:08] now we're just getting ready to live
[1:08:10] like brother Branham saw those two girls
[1:08:12] going through that hotel saying whoopee
[1:08:14] this is life he said no you're wrong
[1:08:16] it's death and brother Brandon came back
[1:08:18] and said there must be two conceptions
[1:08:20] of what life is because David said thy
[1:08:23] loving kindness is better than life my
[1:08:25] lips shall praise thee he said what
[1:08:27] could possibly be better than life but
[1:08:29] then he read she that liveth and
[1:08:31] pleasure is dead while she yet liveth
[1:08:32] and he said there must be two
[1:08:34] conceptions of what life really is and
[1:08:36] they begin to come up with slogans like
[1:08:38] where there's Budweiser there's life or
[1:08:41] life begins with the sun goes down and
[1:08:43] they got a little bit more religious and
[1:08:45] said if you join a church you'll have
[1:08:46] life but there's still two conceptions
[1:08:49] brother Brandon one time went to a
[1:08:51] Service Company dance uh an award
[1:08:54] ceremony and he went to this thing and
[1:08:56] they went through all the ceremonies and
[1:08:58] then they come to the end they said well
[1:09:00] Billy you might want to walk outside
[1:09:01] because we're about to have this dance
[1:09:03] and he said all right well okay and he
[1:09:05] begins to head to the door and this girl
[1:09:07] begins to come through and start picking
[1:09:09] each man and dancing with him and she
[1:09:11] grabs Billy and she said brother Branham
[1:09:13] says do you want to dance he said why
[1:09:14] sure he said but before I do anything I
[1:09:17] always like to pray and he knelt her
[1:09:19] down and started a prayer meeting there
[1:09:21] at that dance floor and broke that up
[1:09:23] because he said there's two conceptions
[1:09:25] of what life is he said one ass suicide
[1:09:27] and the other has Rapture there is a
[1:09:30] life but there is a reality that you can
[1:09:32] find that'll break every every religious
[1:09:35] spirit every spirit of fear and every
[1:09:37] Spirit of depression on your life there
[1:09:39] is a true satisfaction and you don't
[1:09:41] have to settle for a false conception
[1:09:43] when the skies are full of the
[1:09:45] Pentecostal blessing that you can
[1:09:46] receive and experience with a true life
[1:09:48] Giver that'll change your nature it'll
[1:09:50] change your path that you're walking
[1:09:52] through it'll bring that see it and
[1:09:54] burst forth a life of a Son of God or a
[1:09:56] daughter of God and let you know that
[1:09:58] that's the real you it was laying in
[1:10:00] there all the time and Winter's coldness
[1:10:02] cannot stop it from coming forth it'll
[1:10:04] force that death to give up its grip
[1:10:07] oh but there's some Believers he said
[1:10:10] you love them this is where I drew my
[1:10:12] text from you want to see him coming
[1:10:13] you're waiting for him it's a long story
[1:10:15] or a long wait it's a love affair but
[1:10:17] you just can't wait till you see him oh
[1:10:19] my that's the way it is that's the time
[1:10:21] we're looking for that's the hour if
[1:10:23] your heart's not like that tonight be
[1:10:24] careful see be careful don't let the
[1:10:26] enemy deceive you when the Holy Spirit
[1:10:28] in here wants to take its flight to its
[1:10:30] maker to its Master There's A Love
[1:10:32] Affair that no one can tell about it's
[1:10:35] real so if there's a warning saying
[1:10:36] you're not ready for that God might be
[1:10:38] getting ready you ready for something
[1:10:40] see you're not ready you say well if I
[1:10:42] get baptized the Holy Ghost then well
[1:10:45] maybe the Lord will take me and he said
[1:10:47] not only that you're just then getting
[1:10:49] ready to live you ain't ready to live
[1:10:51] till you get the Holy Ghost and then
[1:10:53] when you get the Holy Ghost you're just
[1:10:54] fit to live you wasn't fit to live
[1:10:57] before that see but now you're just fit
[1:10:59] to live after you get the holy you
[1:11:01] ghosts just getting you ready he said
[1:11:03] people say I got to get ready to die
[1:11:05] brother Brown said oh my I'm getting
[1:11:07] getting ready to live amen the thing of
[1:11:09] it is get ready to live live in Christ's
[1:11:12] Victorious Life over sin death and hell
[1:11:14] I already have the victory he's my
[1:11:16] victory and I'm his evidence and I'm the
[1:11:18] evidence of his victory amen he said
[1:11:20] what are you living for he said so you
[1:11:22] can die every one of you what are you
[1:11:24] working for to eat what are you eating
[1:11:26] for to live what are you living for to
[1:11:28] die so he said why not live to live why
[1:11:31] not live to live and he says the only
[1:11:32] way you can live is to accept the word
[1:11:34] and when you accept that word it'll
[1:11:36] bring a life into your life you're not
[1:11:38] just receiving a temporal Joy but you're
[1:11:40] receiving your Escape that whosoever
[1:11:42] believeth on him shall not perish but
[1:11:44] has already passed from Death on the
[1:11:46] life and life cannot exist together with
[1:11:49] death and when you've received that life
[1:11:51] it's past Beyond tribulation it's passed
[1:11:54] Beyond judgment because it will no
[1:11:56] longer magnetize with sin because in you
[1:11:58] is life and brother bran says life
[1:12:00] connects with life and you used to
[1:12:03] connect with the world and you used to
[1:12:04] connect with sin but it'll no longer
[1:12:06] connect anymore because you passed into
[1:12:09] something greater in that life now the
[1:12:11] very same in the same thing that was in
[1:12:13] you to allow you to receive this message
[1:12:15] is the very same thing that won't allow
[1:12:17] you to go through the tribulation
[1:12:19] because life connects with life and
[1:12:21] death connects with death and you passed
[1:12:24] into a realm where your soul is above
[1:12:26] judgment your soul is above sin you're
[1:12:28] living in another realm you're living no
[1:12:30] longer to die but you're getting ready
[1:12:32] to live an immortal life with Jesus
[1:12:35] Christ you passed into something greater
[1:12:37] oh greater than you could ever imagine
[1:12:39] with your temporal mind your soul is
[1:12:41] already in the Heavenly places with
[1:12:43] almighty God oh it can exist together
[1:12:45] blessed is the man to whom God will not
[1:12:47] appute sin and brother Braham said he
[1:12:49] cannot impute sin over that token he
[1:12:52] doesn't even see you the way you see
[1:12:53] yourself he sees you the way he saw you
[1:12:56] before the foundation of the world when
[1:12:57] he accepted you with Christ and spoke
[1:13:00] your name with his and put it on the
[1:13:01] Lamb's Book of Life well that's the way
[1:13:03] he sees you he cannot even impute sin
[1:13:05] onto you little bride you passed into
[1:13:08] something different oh what a Grace
[1:13:11] see how they took that Perfect Tree
[1:13:13] brother Branham said was Jesus Christ
[1:13:15] that perfect tree and it that it might
[1:13:17] be fulfilled in his life you think
[1:13:19] you're going through life by accident
[1:13:20] just look at the life of Jesus Christ
[1:13:23] his birth was fulfilling prophecy and
[1:13:26] there Mary and Joseph were there and
[1:13:28] they were having visions and dreams of
[1:13:30] this baby coming and all along it was
[1:13:32] fulfilling prophecy of those little
[1:13:34] things their day-to-day life was
[1:13:36] fulfilling something when he was called
[1:13:38] out of Egypt it was fulfilling prophecy
[1:13:41] when he was called in Nazarene it was
[1:13:43] fulfilling prophecy when he took our
[1:13:45] infirmities and bear our sicknesses it
[1:13:47] was fulfilling prophecy when he spoke in
[1:13:49] Parables it was fulfilling prophecy and
[1:13:51] one day he rode into a village and said
[1:13:54] You shall find and ask tied into court
[1:13:56] with her loose them and bring them unto
[1:13:57] me and if any man say ought unto you you
[1:14:00] shall say the Lord hath needed them and
[1:14:02] straightway he shall send them all this
[1:14:04] was done that it might be fulfilled
[1:14:06] which was spoken by the prophet saying
[1:14:07] tell you the daughter of Zion thy King
[1:14:10] behold he cometh unto thee meek and
[1:14:12] sitting upon an ass in the cult the full
[1:14:14] of the ass and brother Brown said
[1:14:16] critics came by and said that someone
[1:14:18] went ahead and tied that thing up before
[1:14:20] they ever got there he said critics
[1:14:22] can't understand the pre-arrangement of
[1:14:24] God they can't understand the
[1:14:26] supernatural so they come up with some
[1:14:28] some bizarre explanation he said that no
[1:14:31] wonder a little boy could feed five
[1:14:32] thousand he said the loaves were bigger
[1:14:34] in that day oh but he said brother
[1:14:37] Brandon just said I'll have you to know
[1:14:39] a little boy carried him in his lunch
[1:14:41] but that's the critic's mindset it'd be
[1:14:43] easier to accept that a little boy could
[1:14:45] carry some giant loaf than just to
[1:14:47] accept the pre-arrangement of almighty
[1:14:49] God but his brother and said God gives
[1:14:52] room for critics he said you didn't
[1:14:53] quite catch that that didn't sink in
[1:14:55] just good I'll tell you again God gives
[1:14:57] room for criticism but the word goes on
[1:14:59] he allowed a room because there's a
[1:15:01] Critic and it's becoming of that critic
[1:15:03] to fulfill his part of the word but it's
[1:15:05] becoming a me to fulfill my part of the
[1:15:08] word to fulfill my part as a Believer to
[1:15:10] fulfill my part as a Son of God it's not
[1:15:13] becoming a me to be a Critic they can't
[1:15:15] even understand the pre-arrangement of
[1:15:17] almighty God how God could do something
[1:15:19] like that
[1:15:21] oh when they cast lots on his Vester it
[1:15:23] was fulfilling prophecy how hard that
[1:15:26] must have been for him to sit there and
[1:15:27] watch that going on they rejected their
[1:15:30] sacrifice they rejected the Son of God
[1:15:32] it wasn't easy when he went to the
[1:15:34] Garden of Gethsemane and said not my
[1:15:35] will but thine be done but God never
[1:15:38] said this walk would be easy but it's
[1:15:40] becoming of you to fulfill our
[1:15:42] righteousness it was becoming of Noah to
[1:15:44] stand in the hour of trial it was
[1:15:46] becoming of Enoch to forsake his family
[1:15:48] and take a stroll and fulfill your type
[1:15:50] it was becoming of Daniel not to bow
[1:15:53] down to the image or worship any other
[1:15:55] gods it was becoming of the Hebrew
[1:15:57] children to take their stand for God
[1:15:58] none of this was easy friends but it was
[1:16:01] becoming of Abraham to separate from
[1:16:03] unbelief and it's becoming of you to
[1:16:05] stand by the word and not be ashamed of
[1:16:07] your religion to not be ashamed to take
[1:16:09] your stand with the Lord's despised you
[1:16:11] brother Brandon said I don't believe in
[1:16:13] a lot of nonsense or Tommy rot but I
[1:16:15] believe in the gospel preached in the
[1:16:17] power of demonstration for he said it's
[1:16:19] that what saved me that's what kept Him
[1:16:21] the hour of trial that's what kept him
[1:16:22] in the hospital when he was sick and
[1:16:24] about to die that's what kept her he
[1:16:26] said that's what's going to get him to
[1:16:27] the other side if he ever makes it
[1:16:29] because that's what's always been there
[1:16:31] he wasn't ashamed of that gospel oh you
[1:16:34] see brother Brandon preached that
[1:16:35] message it'd becometh you to fulfill all
[1:16:37] righteousness he preached it while his
[1:16:39] mother was laying on her deathbed and
[1:16:41] they said the devil's been trying to get
[1:16:43] me out of this Pulpit all evening oh you
[1:16:45] see how the devil will try to get you
[1:16:46] out of your position because it's not
[1:16:48] easy when you have to get your children
[1:16:50] together and come to church it'd be
[1:16:52] easier for you to stay home but he's
[1:16:53] trying to get you out of your position
[1:16:55] but God never said it would be easy but
[1:16:57] he said it's becoming of you to fulfill
[1:16:59] all righteousness it's becoming of you
[1:17:01] depressed beyond that he's been trying
[1:17:03] to get your pastor out of the pulpit
[1:17:05] with stage four cancer but there's
[1:17:07] something in him that says it's becoming
[1:17:09] a me to keep the message and move
[1:17:11] forward it's becoming to me to fulfill
[1:17:13] my part of the word what's been spoken
[1:17:15] over my life it's becoming a me though
[1:17:17] it's not easy though it's sometimes hard
[1:17:19] and I have to press through different
[1:17:21] difficulties to get there it's becoming
[1:17:23] a me to stay with that word to stay with
[1:17:25] that message to not be ashamed of My
[1:17:27] Religion oh but don't worry friends or
[1:17:30] think that God doesn't see you he came
[1:17:32] back that night and preached the
[1:17:34] comforter and he said mother doesn't
[1:17:35] even know it but God kept her alive
[1:17:37] while I was preaching God sees what you
[1:17:39] forsaken to be here tonight God sees
[1:17:42] what you've forsaken to stand for this
[1:17:43] message brother bran said who would pay
[1:17:45] a thousand fold everything you forsake
[1:17:47] for almighty God he pays you back in
[1:17:49] Bountiful blessings it's not easy but
[1:17:52] there's a comforter watching over you
[1:17:54] he'll prepay everything you forsake when
[1:17:56] you forsake the world friends young
[1:17:57] people you forsake the world God will
[1:18:00] repay you a thousandfold everything you
[1:18:02] forsake for this message it's becoming
[1:18:04] of you to forsake all and stand for this
[1:18:07] message give your all to it oh I never
[1:18:10] said it would be easy but it's becoming
[1:18:12] of you you're the bride you're
[1:18:14] fulfilling your portion of the scripture
[1:18:16] like Jesus did when he was walking on
[1:18:18] this Earth and it's becoming of you he
[1:18:20] cares you he cared enough to send you
[1:18:23] this message he cared enough to send you
[1:18:25] a comforter oh he's watching over you
[1:18:27] friends
[1:18:29] what a comforter that we have
[1:18:34] oh it's becoming
[1:18:37] oh they said he was washed up
[1:18:39] they hung that Perfect Tree on a Roman
[1:18:41] Tree and said he's washed up because all
[1:18:44] men forsake Him how is it possible to
[1:18:46] see him in the state he didn't lose his
[1:18:48] ministry he was fulfilling it brother
[1:18:50] Brandon said Easter was his crowning he
[1:18:53] wasn't washed up he was fulfilling his
[1:18:55] ministry though rejected and brother
[1:18:57] Brown said I was a great guy when I come
[1:18:59] among you just Healing The Sick speaking
[1:19:02] of visions and showing things but when I
[1:19:04] went to tell you the truth about the
[1:19:05] word what did you turn your back on me
[1:19:07] for do you realize it's just fulfilling
[1:19:09] what the scripture said but there was
[1:19:11] one thing almighty God Stood Beside him
[1:19:14] in the midst of it all and he said I
[1:19:16] pray I wish that God I hope that whole
[1:19:18] Crown my Ministry of letting me take the
[1:19:20] clothes of the word and dress his bride
[1:19:21] in the clothes of the word and let me
[1:19:24] stand on that day and say Behold the
[1:19:25] Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[1:19:27] the world and before he left this Earth
[1:19:29] he saw a vision of a bride passing in
[1:19:31] preview and she was clothed in the word
[1:19:34] she wasn't closed in the scanty garments
[1:19:37] of the world that she was closed in the
[1:19:39] word and when that first charts passed
[1:19:40] before her brother Brandon saw and she
[1:19:42] said my heart was happy it was the
[1:19:45] crowning of his ministry when he
[1:19:47] introduced us to Jesus Christ and said
[1:19:49] my Ministries to declare him he is here
[1:19:51] he was rejected in that third pole
[1:19:53] Ministry but it was the crowning of his
[1:19:55] ministry delivering it to us a message
[1:19:58] clothing Us in the clothes of his word
[1:20:00] and this bride has a humble Ministry
[1:20:02] it's not a public show but they say
[1:20:05] you're washed up because you left the
[1:20:07] Pentecostal church or you left the
[1:20:09] Baptist Church and now you're preaching
[1:20:11] the message and now you're preaching
[1:20:12] adoption and now you're preaching the
[1:20:14] power of God they say you're washed up
[1:20:16] but you're not washed up you're
[1:20:18] prospering we're not getting ready to
[1:20:20] build kingdoms on this Earth We're
[1:20:21] representing the master we're here to
[1:20:24] represent Jesus Christ you have ministry
[1:20:26] here that could put every televangelist
[1:20:28] a shame but we have a promise to meek
[1:20:30] shall inherit the earth we're not here
[1:20:33] to build kingdoms we're here to
[1:20:34] represent the master oh we've got a
[1:20:37] greater desire we're getting ready to
[1:20:39] live and he's said I will God who Crown
[1:20:41] your life you might be a housewife but a
[1:20:43] whole Crown your life with the glory of
[1:20:45] this word and the second coming to take
[1:20:47] you away
[1:20:48] oh it's been spoken over you that you
[1:20:51] shall prosper David said it in Psalms 1
[1:20:54] he'll be like a tree planted by the
[1:20:55] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[1:20:58] fruit and his season his leaves shall
[1:21:00] not wither whatsoever he do is shall
[1:21:02] prosper you may think you're withering
[1:21:05] when you come to church and your car
[1:21:07] breaks down and you don't even have
[1:21:08] money to pay the rent but look a little
[1:21:10] deeper it's already been spoken over you
[1:21:12] and Shout out with her but it shall
[1:21:14] prosper you're a part of God's tree God
[1:21:17] sent you to this earth he said his word
[1:21:19] will not return void but he sent you
[1:21:21] here to fulfill what he called you to do
[1:21:23] when he sent Jesus here he was the lamb
[1:21:25] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:21:27] they said he was washed up but he was
[1:21:30] prospering in the word God sent him to
[1:21:32] do when you've lost loved ones and you
[1:21:35] say how could I possibly be prospering
[1:21:37] but God's watching over you your
[1:21:40] Comforts are just beyond the river and
[1:21:42] we have a promise that he'll never leave
[1:21:43] us nor forsake us so that we may boldly
[1:21:46] say the Lord is my helper I will not
[1:21:48] fear what man shall do unto me and I'd
[1:21:51] rather have that than all the prosperity
[1:21:53] of the world I'd rather have that than
[1:21:55] all the money of the world to know that
[1:21:56] the Lord's on my side that the Lord's my
[1:21:59] helper that he's already promised that
[1:22:01] we're going to make it
[1:22:02] oh they took that perfect tree and they
[1:22:06] killed it but brother man said they
[1:22:08] could only kill it down the roots
[1:22:10] because there was some predestinated
[1:22:12] fruit in that roots and I believe I was
[1:22:14] there that's why the devil could only
[1:22:16] take you so far because you were a gene
[1:22:18] seed An Almighty God you were a
[1:22:20] predestinated fruit down in The Roots so
[1:22:23] they took him down to hell but in hell
[1:22:25] he was conquering death Hell In The
[1:22:26] Grave for you and me that's why he would
[1:22:29] keep that car accident from taking place
[1:22:31] because the devil could only go so far
[1:22:33] but there was some predestinated seed in
[1:22:35] your life to lift you up through every
[1:22:37] trial brother Gabriel he could take you
[1:22:39] so far but he couldn't take you past
[1:22:41] that point where God said there's a
[1:22:43] predestinated seat in his life and you
[1:22:45] must stop here Satan because I'm going
[1:22:47] to bring it forth and a son of God
[1:22:50] because you have roots and more than the
[1:22:52] Spencer family you have roots in glory
[1:22:54] god knew you before the foundation of
[1:22:56] the world brother Brahm said if he
[1:22:57] didn't know me he's not even God because
[1:22:59] God the foreknowledge the omnipotence of
[1:23:02] almighty God knew you before the
[1:23:04] foundation of the world
[1:23:06] oh we prophesied
[1:23:08] of his resurrection he said you destroy
[1:23:11] this Temple I'll bring it back again in
[1:23:13] three days because he was getting ready
[1:23:15] to die he was ready to die but he was
[1:23:18] getting ready to live brother bran said
[1:23:20] where'd that confidence come from
[1:23:21] because he knew what was written about
[1:23:23] him in the word and the same word that
[1:23:25] spoke about him says we are already
[1:23:26] raised in him it said that he'd raise us
[1:23:30] up and we're already raised with him and
[1:23:31] where does your confidence come from
[1:23:33] because what the word spoke about you
[1:23:35] that he which began the work in your
[1:23:37] life we'll see it through your
[1:23:38] confidence comes and what he's spoken
[1:23:41] over you like that little eagle with
[1:23:42] those wings he wasn't afraid of the
[1:23:44] Prophet because he had confidence in the
[1:23:47] wings on his back that would take him
[1:23:48] through in the midst of trial no matter
[1:23:51] what came his way
[1:23:53] brother Brown said about that Finland
[1:23:55] boy he said his resurrection was
[1:23:57] pre-arranged two years before it ever
[1:23:59] happened and he said that same he said
[1:24:01] you're a resurrectionist pre-arranged
[1:24:03] also he said some glorious day he'll
[1:24:06] come it's all pre-arranged when brother
[1:24:08] Branham saw you be on the curtain of
[1:24:09] time he said what did that he said it's
[1:24:11] quickening power in the same quickening
[1:24:13] power that would let him see me beyond
[1:24:15] the curtain that same quickening power
[1:24:17] will see to it that I get there to
[1:24:19] fulfill that Vision it's quickening
[1:24:21] power I may be ready to die but I'm
[1:24:23] getting ready to live because the word
[1:24:25] spoken Resurrection over our lives the
[1:24:27] word spoken Joy over our lives I'm
[1:24:29] already spoken for brother Branham said
[1:24:32] no wonder he said fear not oh no wonder
[1:24:35] he said fear not because he's already
[1:24:37] been there he's already walked that dark
[1:24:40] path of the grave and he's already seen
[1:24:43] how that promise of Resurrection works
[1:24:45] so he says no wonder he said fear not
[1:24:48] he's been there oh he's been there
[1:24:52] he would know
[1:24:54] because you planted your life in
[1:24:55] something with influence
[1:24:57] we have a sure word
[1:24:59] and brother bran said he planted that
[1:25:01] tree on the day of Pentecost he planted
[1:25:04] it and he divided his life he divided
[1:25:07] his life for you and for me he divided
[1:25:09] his life brother and said that's the
[1:25:11] message we must get to the people how
[1:25:13] God divided his life that's still the
[1:25:16] message we must get to the people that
[1:25:17] God must divide his life you must be
[1:25:20] born again he'll put in you a life to
[1:25:23] carry you through oh what a Grace
[1:25:26] but there came in some messengers of
[1:25:28] death
[1:25:30] that came in a palm where I'm distill
[1:25:32] your joy distill the fruits off the tree
[1:25:34] distill your peace he come to steal the
[1:25:37] joy because Brothers had a dignified
[1:25:39] group came amongst the common people and
[1:25:42] they said this revival is good but
[1:25:44] you're going to have to stop all that
[1:25:46] shouting if you want us to come among
[1:25:48] your group we want to join but you're
[1:25:50] going to have to get rid of all of that
[1:25:51] because It embarrasses us you people
[1:25:53] make too much noise they eat away the
[1:25:56] joy of your salvation till the presence
[1:25:58] of the Lord has departed from them the
[1:26:00] cares of the world has dried up their
[1:26:02] experience to the cares of your job you
[1:26:04] can't even come to church and praise the
[1:26:06] Lord because the cares of your job has
[1:26:08] dried up your joy it's dried up that
[1:26:10] channel to where you'd you can't even
[1:26:12] Worship the Lord when you're driving
[1:26:14] down the car it's just mind battles it's
[1:26:16] just confusion Satan's try to clog up
[1:26:19] that channel but brother Brown said the
[1:26:20] spirit of God ought to be Joy he said
[1:26:23] people that don't believe in shouting
[1:26:24] haven't got enough spiritual Joy
[1:26:26] something got in there and clogged up
[1:26:28] that channel until they couldn't rejoice
[1:26:29] in the Lord some teacher came by and
[1:26:32] said it was a bunch of emotion and
[1:26:33] clogged up a channel till they couldn't
[1:26:35] have any spiritual Joy oh but there's a
[1:26:38] restoration for your joy you can come to
[1:26:41] the house of the Lord and find Freedom
[1:26:43] I've had more joy believe in this
[1:26:45] message than I ever did and all the
[1:26:46] things of the world than I ever did at
[1:26:49] any basketball game or any football game
[1:26:51] though I may have enjoyed them this
[1:26:53] message has been a Greater Joy to me
[1:26:54] than everything there's been a
[1:26:56] restoration happened in my life that's
[1:26:58] given me a joy that passes all
[1:27:00] understanding it's a joy in the midst of
[1:27:02] the world falling apart it's a victory
[1:27:04] it's the rejoy the Restoration in our
[1:27:08] midst oh he can do it for you let this
[1:27:11] message be Amen to you when you come to
[1:27:14] church and pastors preaching to say amen
[1:27:16] Amen to that word amen to that word and
[1:27:19] you'll start forgetting about the things
[1:27:21] of your day and the things of your job
[1:27:23] and all of a sudden that withered Leaf
[1:27:25] will start to become a lovely Leaf in
[1:27:27] the presence of God Joy will begin to
[1:27:29] flow into your life that devil has tried
[1:27:31] to steal that from you he's a robber but
[1:27:34] there's a restoration you can receive
[1:27:36] and get under this message and let it be
[1:27:38] Amen to you it'll open up that channel
[1:27:42] Hallelujah you may have come
[1:27:45] in the seat of the scornful
[1:27:48] oh but you can plant yourself in a
[1:27:50] different place and he'll give you
[1:27:52] Beauty for Ashes he'll give you the oil
[1:27:54] of joy for mourning in the Garment of
[1:27:57] Praise for the spirit of heaviness he'll
[1:27:59] try to come and eat away your peace and
[1:28:02] to know that you're saved to know that
[1:28:04] you're going to make it and he'll try to
[1:28:06] replace it with reciting or joining
[1:28:09] brother bran said there's no joy in that
[1:28:12] but he said thanks God that's not thank
[1:28:14] the Lord that's not God's tree that's
[1:28:17] not God's provided way but we know who
[1:28:20] we are we know who we came from what's
[1:28:22] your identity it's not Methodist it's
[1:28:24] not Baptist but your identity is born
[1:28:27] again that's why you can't hybrid that's
[1:28:30] why you can't fall because there's
[1:28:31] something in your identity that shows
[1:28:33] you where you came from and shows you
[1:28:35] where you're going like Paul on the
[1:28:38] ocean that day said fear not friends be
[1:28:40] of good cheer for the angel has come and
[1:28:42] spoke to me and said you must be peer
[1:28:44] before Caesar and all those that are in
[1:28:46] the ship with you are going so to fear
[1:28:48] not and be of good cheer I don't know
[1:28:50] what's going to happen between here and
[1:28:52] the other land but I know that the
[1:28:53] ship's going to make it to the other
[1:28:55] side be of good cheer friends you're on
[1:28:57] the ship brother Branham said it's going
[1:28:59] to the other side he said it's not going
[1:29:01] to wreck up till it reaches the shore of
[1:29:03] Glory you can let off the pressure in
[1:29:05] the presence of God there's a City of
[1:29:07] Refuge you can enter into and there's a
[1:29:09] peace that passeth all understanding
[1:29:11] brother Brandon said cast your cares
[1:29:13] upon Him for he cares for you is written
[1:29:15] on every door in that City you can come
[1:29:18] in there and stake down a stake and say

[1:29:25] Christ because he made it for me oh
[1:29:27] you've already made it in him you can
[1:29:29] let off that pressure there's a cycle
[1:29:31] breaker that can break that spirit of
[1:29:32] fear that try to torment you young
[1:29:34] people that comforter is a cycle breaker
[1:29:37] I've been their cycle after cycle but

[1:29:53] but there's a piece that can be
[1:29:54] installed in your life and let you know
[1:29:57] who you are and let you know where you
[1:29:59] came from and let you know what your
[1:30:00] identity is you may be battling identity
[1:30:03] complex but there's a piece in the
[1:30:05] building to settle that for your life

[1:30:09] already made it in him you're a threat
[1:30:11] to Satan's kingdom you're anointed to be
[1:30:13] a serpent Bruiser you were created to
[1:30:16] serve the Lord oh brother Ron spoke
[1:30:18] those words to me in a prayer line one
[1:30:20] time and I held those in many a dark
[1:30:22] night in my bedroom alone in the midst
[1:30:24] of great fears I said I'm a threat to
[1:30:26] Satan's kingdom I'm anointed to be a
[1:30:28] serpent loser I'm created to serve the
[1:30:30] Lord when I didn't even know if I

[1:31:42] of Pentecost it'll make you different
[1:31:43] it'll change you it'll give you a
[1:31:46] reality that that Palmer has come in and

[1:32:55] away your joy but we have something in
[1:32:58] common friends it's this message he said

[1:33:05] the presence of God we have something in
[1:33:06] common Jesus Christ has saved us we

[1:33:11] Rapture we're going in a resurrection to
[1:33:13] together friends we believe this same
[1:33:15] message and we've come to lift up Jesus
[1:33:17] Christ and declare him as the King of
[1:33:19] Kings and the Lord of lords all those
[1:33:22] little odd feelings you might be a good
[1:33:24] person that just got planted in the
[1:33:26] wrong place you got planted in an
[1:33:28] offense or a complex somewhere and that
[1:33:30] Devil's tried to steal away your joy and
[1:33:32] say well so and so offended me you know
[1:33:35] try to get you away from that flock of
[1:33:36] deer that's just where the devil wants
[1:33:38] you to destroy your life but stay under
[1:33:41] the protection of Fellowship stay under
[1:33:43] those Cool Waters where you can

[1:33:54] people oh but we love you we're here for
[1:33:57] you pastors here for you your brother's
[1:33:59] here for you you don't have to get that
[1:34:01] complex that no one loves you stay under
[1:34:04] that coolness and then you don't just
[1:34:06] have to go to church to get under an
[1:34:08] atmosphere you'll carry it with you
[1:34:09] everywhere you go you'll be a place
[1:34:11] where others can cool off underneath you
[1:34:14] talk about the Lord Fellowship about
[1:34:16] what he's done for you oh it's a Grace
[1:34:22] that third bug
[1:34:24] was a canker worm
[1:34:26] and he come for that bark
[1:34:28] and the bark was the covering
[1:34:31] you see he didn't say the leaves were
[1:34:33] the covering
[1:34:34] religion was never meant to be a
[1:34:36] covering for you
[1:34:38] but what this what this devil does is he
[1:34:40] tries to come in and trade a natural for
[1:34:42] a spiritual like that first church
[1:34:45] Israel
[1:34:46] they said oh my
[1:34:48] there Samuel was leading them under the
[1:34:50] power of the Holy Ghost the pillar of
[1:34:52] fire was leading them they were winning
[1:34:54] every battle they were winning every war
[1:34:57] under the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:58] but they got to looking out at the
[1:35:00] Philistines Army where a natural King
[1:35:03] was leading them and they said my
[1:35:05] wouldn't it be nice to have a king like
[1:35:07] them wouldn't it be nice to have a king
[1:35:09] like them they said we appreciate the
[1:35:12] Miracles and the wisdom and the
[1:35:13] provision and protection we believe it
[1:35:15] it said we like it and furthermore we
[1:35:17] don't want to be without it it's just
[1:35:19] that we want a king to lead us into
[1:35:21] battle
[1:35:22] they said it's still Our intention to
[1:35:24] have the priests go ahead with Judo
[1:35:27] following and we'll blow the trumpets
[1:35:28] and shout and sing We don't intend to
[1:35:30] stop any of that we want we want a king
[1:35:32] who is one of us to lead us they said oh
[1:35:35] we'll still quote the prophet we'll
[1:35:37] still go and sit in the message church
[1:35:39] we want all of that in fact we
[1:35:41] appreciate it but we want a natural
[1:35:42] leadership instead of the leadership of
[1:35:45] the pillar of fire and they rejected
[1:35:47] natural leadership for the leadership of
[1:35:49] the Holy Ghost and brother the Bible it
[1:35:51] says little did they realize that when
[1:35:53] they were asking God to let them be like
[1:35:55] the rest of the world they were
[1:35:57] rejecting him though they kept all their
[1:35:59] Creeds though they kept all their Church
[1:36:01] going though they got up in church and
[1:36:03] sang they said we want all of it what we
[1:36:05] don't want the leadership of the Holy
[1:36:06] Ghost and when you reject the power of
[1:36:09] God you've rejected the very thing that
[1:36:11] made you different from the rest of the
[1:36:12] world but it's not becoming of you to
[1:36:14] look the same as the world it's becoming
[1:36:17] of you to not be ashamed of this message
[1:36:19] it's becoming of you to stand with this
[1:36:21] word not to reject this power of God not
[1:36:24] to reject the moving of the Holy Spirit
[1:36:26] to come into the church and speak to
[1:36:29] your hearts and minister to you and
[1:36:31] perform the miraculous
[1:36:33] oh they rejected the very thing that
[1:36:35] made them different
[1:36:37] and when you say we don't need the Holy
[1:36:39] Spirit to heal the sick or we got
[1:36:41] doctors we don't know the Holy Spirit to
[1:36:43] speak when tongues we're all intelligent
[1:36:45] people he said when you do that you take
[1:36:47] right from your framework the lifeline
[1:36:49] the lifeline of the church oh how come
[1:36:53] and try to give you a false satisfaction
[1:36:56] in place of a true but that's the devil
[1:36:58] trying to rob you of that true joy and
[1:37:01] that true peace
[1:37:03] you see this tactic of Satan would be
[1:37:06] distilled your joy to steal your
[1:37:09] fellowship
[1:37:10] but he's going for that life
[1:37:12] he may start small but he's going for
[1:37:15] that life he's trying to get to that
[1:37:17] tree and still the life from me he tried
[1:37:19] to come in and suck out the very life to
[1:37:22] denominate a move of God that Satan's
[1:37:25] tactic to come in and take that away
[1:37:28] from you
[1:37:29] but God is determined that that wouldn't
[1:37:31] happen to you because he called you he
[1:37:35] called you to be his bride oh Satan
[1:37:37] would try to steal that life from you
[1:37:39] but God is determined that this Vine
[1:37:41] won't die he said what about those
[1:37:43] things that went off in denomination but
[1:37:46] the Bible says the husbandman watches
[1:37:48] over the tree he comes by and he trims
[1:37:50] It Off when something becomes some some
[1:37:53] someone come into the nominated Luther's
[1:37:56] message to come by and just trimmed it
[1:37:57] off he come by and just trimmed it off
[1:37:59] but brother Brown said the main part of
[1:38:01] the thing kept growing
[1:38:03] justification grew into sanctification
[1:38:05] which grew into the Holy Ghost which
[1:38:09] grew into the word itself but God he
[1:38:11] said God never touched that vine when he
[1:38:14] trimmed off those denominational
[1:38:15] branches he never touched that vine he
[1:38:18] never touched true justification he
[1:38:20] never touched true sanctification he
[1:38:23] never touched the true baptism of the
[1:38:25] Holy Ghost he never touched the true
[1:38:27] message he only trimmed off the
[1:38:29] denominational things and so when they
[1:38:31] come in some of them bring their
[1:38:33] chainsaws and they try to trim off
[1:38:35] legalism and they accidentally hit right
[1:38:37] into true sanctification they try to
[1:38:40] trim off fanaticism and they hit into a
[1:38:43] true experience but when God gave you
[1:38:45] this message it was already trimmed
[1:38:47] formalism was already trimmed off of
[1:38:49] this message fanaticism was already
[1:38:51] trimmed over the smell for this message
[1:38:53] oh put your chainsaws away and just
[1:38:55] preach the message just believe the
[1:38:57] message it's already trimmed for you you
[1:38:59] don't have to worry about fanaticism
[1:39:01] God's watching over his heritage Edge
[1:39:03] he's watching over you he's already
[1:39:05] trimmed it off but he never touched that
[1:39:07] reality and they would come in and try
[1:39:10] to deny the Church of the vine they
[1:39:12] tried to deny you of a true experience
[1:39:14] they tried to deny you of true
[1:39:16] sanctification and he said who would
[1:39:17] deny me of my Vine but I say like Elijah
[1:39:21] if God cares to send the crows with some
[1:39:23] meal I don't know where it comes from
[1:39:25] but I'm just going to eat it he said
[1:39:27] that's the same way with the Holy Ghost
[1:39:29] when God sends over just a sweep of Joy
[1:39:32] brother and said I don't know where it
[1:39:33] comes from all I know is God sent it and
[1:39:36] I enjoy it and if he cared enough to
[1:39:38] send it I care enough to receive it if
[1:39:41] he cared enough to send us this message
[1:39:43] I care enough to receive it if he cares
[1:39:46] enough to send a sweep of a Spirit of
[1:39:48] Dance through this building I care
[1:39:50] enough to receive it he's looking for
[1:39:52] somebody that's going to care enough to
[1:39:54] receive what he sends if he cares to
[1:39:56] send you a restoration of Joy tonight
[1:39:58] why don't you care to receive what he
[1:40:00] sends you why don't you care to receive
[1:40:02] when he's sends you your peace why do
[1:40:04] you care when he sends if he cares to
[1:40:06] send me a Rapture I care enough to
[1:40:09] receive it if he cares enough to send us
[1:40:11] our prodigals home I care enough to
[1:40:13] receive it God knew your characters no
[1:40:16] accident you received this message he
[1:40:18] knew there was something you need to
[1:40:19] receive it that's why he sent it to you
[1:40:21] you're his bride you cared for him you
[1:40:24] cared enough to ask for Joy you cared
[1:40:27] enough to ask for a Revival and God said
[1:40:29] if they care to ask for it I'll care to
[1:40:31] send it and they'll care to receive it
[1:40:34] Go receive it with a joy they'll receive
[1:40:37] it because they love me and they're my
[1:40:39] bride it's no accident you're here in
[1:40:41] Virginia it's no accident you're at Full
[1:40:43] Gospel Lighthouse God knew the desires
[1:40:46] of your heart and he had you in the
[1:40:48] right place at the right time to receive
[1:40:50] this message like the woman at the well
[1:40:52] it was the same intelligence that puts

[1:43:00] oh and nothing can stop this one nothing
[1:43:03] can stop this bride he said this time
[1:43:05] because the word is predestinated
[1:43:07] nothing is going to stop it said all the
[1:43:11] bugs of hell can turn loose on her and
[1:43:13] it will never stop her oh you weren't
[1:43:15] just the predestinated fruit in The
[1:43:16] Roots anymore you're the living fruits
[1:43:19] of his presence his son has passed over
[1:43:21] you and quickened you oh you're living
[1:43:24] in his presence
[1:43:27] you say
[1:43:29] well late frost hurt the crop what if a
[1:43:32] late Frost comes what if it's too late
[1:43:35] for our prodigals to come home
[1:43:37] but Martha one day brother Brandon said
[1:43:40] Lazarus
[1:43:42] he said Lazarus and Jesus were friends
[1:43:45] he said they would play together
[1:43:47] he said Mary and Martha and said they
[1:43:49] would build tapestries together for the
[1:43:53] temple
[1:43:54] and one day Lazarus come and said
[1:43:56] there's a mighty Prophet standing down
[1:43:58] on Jordan he speaks of one greater than
[1:44:00] he's becoming who will baptize with the
[1:44:02] Holy Ghost and Fire you ought to go down
[1:44:04] and see him
[1:44:06] he said you don't know who's sitting
[1:44:08] next to you
[1:44:09] you don't know who's sitting next to you
[1:44:12] you don't know when you go out into town
[1:44:14] who you're talking with it may be a very
[1:44:16] member of the Bride of Jesus Christ it
[1:44:19] was just one baptizing down by Jordan
[1:44:21] telling about a man but you don't know
[1:44:22] who's sitting next to you tonight you
[1:44:24] don't know the power that's in that life
[1:44:26] you don't know who you're bumping into
[1:44:28] day to day it may be Angels you don't
[1:44:30] know who's sitting next to you
[1:44:32] but they said Jesus ministry took him
[1:44:35] away from home
[1:44:37] immediately trouble set in
[1:44:39] and Lazarus took sick
[1:44:41] and Jesus wouldn't come
[1:44:44] and they said
[1:44:46] Jesus note all things the father had
[1:44:48] showed them
[1:44:50] he said brother man said I believe he's
[1:44:52] seen the resurrection of Lazarus
[1:44:55] he said our friend Lazarus sleepeth and
[1:44:57] they thought he did well but he said no
[1:44:58] he's dead and for your sake I'm glad I
[1:45:01] wasn't there
[1:45:04] he said I believe he's seen the
[1:45:05] resurrection of Lazarus when all hopes
[1:45:07] were gone The Miracle Worker had let
[1:45:09] them down
[1:45:10] and Martha was there and that the first
[1:45:12] day there was nothing
[1:45:14] at the second day there was nothing but
[1:45:16] all of a sudden a rumor came that The
[1:45:19] Miracle Worker was coming into their
[1:45:20] midst all of a sudden a rumor came Jesus
[1:45:24] is coming back into town
[1:45:26] Jesus is coming back into town
[1:45:28] but Martha didn't just let that stay a
[1:45:30] rumor
[1:45:31] Martha remembered the story of the
[1:45:33] shunamite woman
[1:45:35] how God
[1:45:36] and the Prophet Elijah
[1:45:39] had come down
[1:45:41] and there was a woman with a dead baby
[1:45:44] and that baby came to life through God
[1:45:47] and Elijah
[1:45:49] because that shoonamite woman recognized
[1:45:52] that it was more than Elijah in her
[1:45:54] midst but it was almighty God
[1:45:56] and Martha's sitting here remembering
[1:45:58] that and she's thinking surely if God
[1:46:01] was with his Prophet Elijah surely he's
[1:46:04] with his son says surely he's with this
[1:46:07] word that's coming into the town surely
[1:46:09] he's with his son she wasn't worried
[1:46:12] about the outward appearance she wasn't
[1:46:14] worried about who it was coming through
[1:46:16] she wasn't worried about if it was
[1:46:18] coming through Andrew Spencer or Ron
[1:46:20] Spencer or brother William she said
[1:46:22] surely if God was with his Prophet
[1:46:25] surely he's with his son and Martha
[1:46:28] recognized the potential of what was
[1:46:29] coming into her midst she recognized the
[1:46:32] potential that the same God was in or
[1:46:34] missed it wasn't just a rumor to Martha
[1:46:36] but she said he's in our midst he's here
[1:46:38] right now to do the impossible Martha
[1:46:41] recognized the potential of what was
[1:46:42] coming into town she recognized the
[1:46:45] potential of the word oh he said maybe
[1:46:47] brother branham's gone but she didn't
[1:46:49] pray for Elijah to return she recognized
[1:46:51] the potential of what was in her midst
[1:46:53] you see brother bran said when Elijah
[1:46:55] left he made preparations that the
[1:46:56] spirit of God might remain on the earth
[1:46:58] in Elisha oh he made preparations that
[1:47:01] the spirit of God might remain in a
[1:47:03] bride we're not looking for brother
[1:47:05] Branham to return to give us this great
[1:47:08] Revival I have news for the devil what
[1:47:10] they're looking for to return it never
[1:47:12] left but it's here with a bride body can
[1:47:15] you recognize the potential of what's in
[1:47:17] your midst like the woman with the blood
[1:47:19] issue recognize the potential though 12
[1:47:22] years with this Affliction she
[1:47:23] recognized the potential of what was
[1:47:25] coming into her midst can you recognize
[1:47:27] the potential like blind Bartimaeus that
[1:47:30] sold his lamb because something was
[1:47:32] coming to his midst that could change
[1:47:34] everything that could change every
[1:47:36] horror can you recognize like Mariah
[1:47:38] Pruitt when she stepped into a prayer
[1:47:40] line and said there's something in my
[1:47:42] midst oh it's not just a history lesson
[1:47:44] but there's something here that can
[1:47:46] change all things can you recognize
[1:47:48] what's in your midst can you recognize
[1:47:50] the potential oh when television was
[1:47:53] there they would have called him
[1:47:54] mentally upset
[1:47:56] as something vibrating through the air
[1:47:58] could perform a picture because somebody
[1:48:01] believed there was an airwave God had it
[1:48:04] there in one bright day they broke into
[1:48:06] that realm and picked it up and it
[1:48:08] produced a picture Thomas Edison thought
[1:48:11] there was a rumor that electricity was
[1:48:14] possible there was a rumor that
[1:48:17] electricity could carry over a wire and
[1:48:19] make light and it didn't give up on the
[1:48:21] first wire but he searched every wire he
[1:48:24] searched night and day while he ate a
[1:48:27] sandwich while he drank his coffee he
[1:48:29] was searching for the potential that
[1:48:31] that rumor held that all things were
[1:48:34] possible that light could come forth oh
[1:48:37] are you hearing me friends he recognized
[1:48:39] that there was a potential in his midst
[1:48:41] that there could come light oh
[1:48:45] I'm coming down to close
[1:48:47] but listen to this
[1:48:50] there's a Wright brothers one time who
[1:48:52] thought
[1:48:53] flight is possible
[1:48:56] and Wilbur Wright wrote this letter he
[1:48:59] said for some years
[1:49:00] I have been Afflicted with the belief
[1:49:02] that flight is possible to man
[1:49:05] my disease has increased in severity
[1:49:08] I feel it will soon cost me an increased
[1:49:11] amount of money
[1:49:12] if not my life
[1:49:14] I've been trying to arrange my Affairs
[1:49:16] in such a way that I can vote my entire
[1:49:18] life
[1:49:19] to a few months of experiment in this
[1:49:21] field
[1:49:24] but friends
[1:49:26] he had typhoid fever
[1:49:29] but his disease
[1:49:31] his disease was not his affliction
[1:49:34] his Affliction was that flight was
[1:49:36] possible
[1:49:40] oh your disease
[1:49:42] might be that your prodigals are gone
[1:49:45] your disease
[1:49:47] might be that you're sick in your body
[1:49:50] your disease might be that you have
[1:49:51] stage four cancer
[1:49:53] but your Affliction is that you've
[1:49:55] recognized the potential of what's
[1:49:57] coming your midst oh Ron Spencer might
[1:50:00] have a disease of cancer but Ron
[1:50:01] Spencer's Affliction is that one day
[1:50:03] he's going to preach this message no
[1:50:05] come such a sweep that it'll change his
[1:50:07] body from Glory from Mortal immortality
[1:50:11] so your disease isn't your Affliction
[1:50:13] your Affliction is that the I am is in
[1:50:16] the building and all things are possible
[1:50:18] and this revival isn't just a rumor but
[1:50:21] there's a reality here you're Afflicted
[1:50:24] with the desire the potential that one
[1:50:26] day your prodigal is all going to walk
[1:50:28] through that back door your Affliction

[1:50:33] to leave your body and you're going to

[1:50:40] meet him in the air your Affliction is
[1:50:42] that your joy is here your peace is here

[1:50:46] it your Affliction is that you're a Son
[1:50:48] of God and you can press through every
[1:50:50] battle your disease might be heavy your
