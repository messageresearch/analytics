[50:45] Lord Jesus Christ
[50:47] amen if you have your Bibles this
[50:49] evening would like to look over
[50:50] in the last book of the Bible over in
[50:53] the Book of Revelations
[50:55] Revelations chapter 3.
[50:58] Revelations chapter 3 and verse 20.
[51:14] Revelations chapter 3 and verse 20 and
[51:17] say Amen when you have it this evening
[51:21] amen behold I stand at the door and
[51:24] knock and if any man hear my voice and
[51:26] open the door I will come into him and
[51:29] will sup with him and he with me to him
[51:32] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[51:34] me in my throne even as I also overcame
[51:38] and am set down with my father in his
[51:41] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[51:44] what the spirit saith under the churches
[51:47] may God bless his word he may be seated
[51:49] here in the presence of the Lord
[51:51] another random said in this message how
[51:54] can I overcome he said overcome means to
[51:57] recognize the devil in every one of his
[51:59] tricks he said a lot of people say there
[52:01] is no devil and he said it they say it's
[52:04] just a thought don't you believe that he
[52:06] said there's a real devil he's just as
[52:09] real as you are or anybody a real devil
[52:12] and you must recognize him real you must
[52:14] know he's a devil and then the same time
[52:17] that you recognize him know that he's a
[52:19] devil and he's against you then to
[52:22] overcome you must recognize that the god
[52:24] in you is greater and mightier than he
[52:27] is that the one that is in you has
[52:30] already overcome him and by his grace
[52:33] you are more than a match for him amen
[52:35] There's real overcoming when you
[52:39] recognize There's real overcoming when
[52:42] you recognize that the god that is in
[52:45] you is greater than the enemy that is
[52:48] attacking you tonight I would like to
[52:50] speak to you on on a thought just for a
[52:52] few minutes on destined destined to
[52:55] overcome and Jesus said these in John 16
[52:59] and 33 he said these things I have
[53:01] spoken unto you that in me you might
[53:04] have peace in the world you shall have
[53:06] tribulation but be of good cheer I I
[53:09] have overcome the world and that
[53:11] powerful tonight to know that that
[53:13] whatever we face that I our Lord Jesus
[53:16] Christ I have overcome the world it
[53:19] doesn't matter what we stack up against
[53:21] us or what all the odds that might be
[53:23] against us I have overcome the world and
[53:26] Jesus is saying to us in the unbelieving
[53:29] world you're going to have trouble
[53:30] you're going to have you're going to
[53:32] have Sorrows but I want you to be
[53:34] courageous There's real peace in me I
[53:36] want you to be courageous in knowing
[53:38] that I have conquered the world for you
[53:41] I have conquered the world for you isn't
[53:44] that powerful tonight to know that
[53:45] there's nothing that we can come up
[53:47] against there's nothing that we could
[53:49] face that our Lord Jesus Christ hasn't
[53:51] already conquered now brother random
[53:53] said in the mark of the beast he said
[53:55] there's going to be a group a p of
[53:58] people that's going to be marked for
[54:00] Destiny and hell and there's going to be
[54:02] a people that's smart for their Eternal
[54:04] Destiny in heaven and he said those two
[54:06] marks run side by side so we recognize
[54:09] that Jesus would tell us as he's closing
[54:12] out the hours of his ministry here on
[54:14] Earth two thousand years ago he said
[54:16] that that the Antichrist would go about
[54:18] and it would it would it would go out
[54:20] and it would try to deceive the very
[54:22] elect if it was possible so we recognize
[54:25] that the Christ Spirit and the
[54:27] Antichrist spirit that they run so close
[54:29] together but you are a people that have
[54:32] a destiny that is not a destiny unto
[54:34] hell but you have a destiny that is
[54:36] built and you have a destiny that is
[54:38] going to heaven again in the great
[54:40] Shining Light he said it gives us
[54:42] consolation to know this that we don't
[54:45] hold our own destiny god holds our
[54:48] destiny and he has ordained it to be so
[54:50] and there's nothing that will ever
[54:52] interrupt the program of God we are
[54:55] bound to arrive and we recognize that
[54:57] the Holy Ghost is a seal it is a it is a
[55:00] seal of promise when you receive the
[55:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the Seal
[55:04] of God's covenant upon your life that he
[55:07] has accepted you as your faith in him
[55:09] but it is a seal that is a seal that you
[55:12] are sealed until the day of your
[55:15] Redemption so so Jesus when you receive
[55:17] the Holy Ghost he seals you to your
[55:20] destination it's just like a boxcar
[55:22] that's loaded up and it's it's loaded up
[55:24] and the inspector goes through and he
[55:26] looks over that he he sees everything
[55:28] that it's not rocked out of its place
[55:29] it's not Tipsy Topsy like the rest of
[55:32] the world but it's real settled in there
[55:34] because the inspectors went through it
[55:36] so he puts the seal of approval on it
[55:38] that it's built to go down the road and
[55:40] stand the test of time you see you are
[55:43] that kind of people that God has
[55:45] designed and destined to be a people
[55:48] that is sealed until the day of your
[55:50] Redemption and what a privilege it is
[55:52] tonight to know that you are carrying
[55:54] not the mark of the Antichrist but you
[55:57] are carrying the very Mark of the word
[55:59] of the Lord and it is by the hearing of
[56:02] the ear that you have put your faith
[56:04] into action Hallelujah you are a
[56:06] destined people that's destined for
[56:08] destination and your destiny is not hell
[56:11] remember the Brandon brother Branham on
[56:13] time he was he was in his early
[56:14] Ministries and he was he was speaking
[56:16] and he had a vision while he was in his
[56:18] hotel room that there was a little bitty
[56:20] girl a blonde-headed girl that was that
[56:22] was about yay tall he said and he said
[56:24] he said she was about ye Tony and he
[56:26] said I watched her he said I watched her
[56:28] as she as she was she was destined to be
[56:31] in a car wreck he said and he said a
[56:33] great big black automobile come running
[56:35] down the road and killed her he said but
[56:37] in the vision the angel told me have
[56:39] prayer for that child that this would be
[56:41] bypassed and the angel told him said
[56:43] you're going to hear about this two or
[56:45] three days afterwards he said he come to
[56:47] find out that the very hour that the
[56:49] vision was taking place he said there he
[56:52] said that girl he said that girl barely
[56:55] escaped death at that moment you see
[56:57] what the power of prayer did there there
[57:00] was a Destiny for her to go buy a car
[57:03] wreck but there was an angel that was
[57:05] standing there and said pray for that
[57:07] girl and to think that tonight that the
[57:09] power of prayer changed the very destiny
[57:12] that God had already seen and you don't
[57:14] know necessarily what happened or what
[57:16] come about of those things but you don't
[57:18] realize sometimes that the thing that
[57:20] you're praying about has a generational
[57:22] blessing that is behind it you don't
[57:24] know exactly who that woman was but she
[57:26] wasn't killed in that accident maybe she
[57:28] raised daughters maybe she raped sons
[57:30] that became to begin to preach the very
[57:32] power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ you
[57:35] don't know what happened but there was a
[57:37] generational blessing that could not be
[57:39] stopped by the curse of death I think
[57:41] about my own life tonight how Hell tried
[57:44] to Railroad my life and try to destroy
[57:46] my life but there was a God that was
[57:48] greater than hell that tried to send a
[57:50] train to my tracks and try to run me
[57:53] over and kill me if he would have got a
[57:55] hold of me he'd have stopped my
[57:56] daughters from getting here it's the
[57:58] same way with any of you if hell could
[58:00] have had its way it would have had the
[58:02] whole world because if he could get a
[58:04] son and daughter of God he would have
[58:05] the very power of life in it and if he
[58:08] gave watch you it'd have the whole world
[58:09] but we are a people that are not
[58:12] destined to be the children of Satan but
[58:14] we are destined to be the children of
[58:16] the most high God hail can't railroad
[58:19] you hell can't stop you it's because
[58:22] you're destined to live a life
[58:24] for almighty God
[58:27] Hallelujah
[58:29] I love that when that when we go to
[58:31] reading over in in the in their last in
[58:34] the last book of Mark that that there we
[58:37] see that at the rising of the Sun that
[58:39] Jesus appeared to a woman that was full
[58:42] of mistakes at one time in her life that
[58:45] he appeared unto her and out of the one
[58:47] that he cast seven now and Seven Devils
[58:49] out of and it's amazing that God would
[58:52] show himself to a woman of that stature
[58:55] but she was the very first one that he
[58:58] would show himself alive to there in the
[59:01] garden and you notice that that when
[59:03] when Mary begins to take the message
[59:05] back to her disciples and her brothers
[59:08] and sisters that the Bible said in Mark
[59:10] 16 when she began to witness these
[59:13] things that they believe not
[59:15] you're not amazing but here is the most
[59:17] powerful people on Earth that's been
[59:19] with the Messiah been with the anointed
[59:21] one but they believe not and then Jesus
[59:23] appears to those on the road to Emmaus
[59:25] that they are there they appeared unto
[59:28] them and when they came back to the
[59:30] company they told them of the story of
[59:32] what Jesus had done there and the Bible
[59:35] said and neither they believe thee them
[59:38] but there was a certain hour there was a
[59:41] certain hour that Jesus came and he
[59:43] appeared unto the eleven as they were
[59:45] sitting down there at meat and the Bible
[59:47] said that he'll braided them for their
[59:50] unbelief and their Hardness of Heart
[59:51] because they believed not them which had
[59:54] seen him after his resurrection or after
[59:57] he was risen I think it's a very
[59:59] powerful thing that Jesus Takes a people
[1:00:01] that he condemns them for their unbelief
[1:00:04] he takes them a people who does not
[1:00:06] believe and then he turns around and
[1:00:09] because the word of the Lord corrects
[1:00:11] the error in every single one of our
[1:00:13] Lives Jesus immediately takes a people
[1:00:16] that were full of doubt and the people
[1:00:18] that were full of unbelief any
[1:00:19] commissions those same people
[1:00:22] those same people that just just denied
[1:00:24] him didn't believe what the others had
[1:00:26] said but he takes a people and he tells
[1:00:29] them go into all the world and baptize
[1:00:31] him in my name that these signs shall
[1:00:33] follow them that believe in my name
[1:00:35] you'll cast out devils in my name you
[1:00:37] can take up serpents in my name you can
[1:00:40] drink any deadly thing and it shall not
[1:00:42] harm you it's amazing what the very
[1:00:45] power of the word will do when it takes
[1:00:47] a hold of a chosen vessel's life
[1:00:51] now you know what I'm talking about
[1:00:52] because you're not the same one that you
[1:00:54] was you see it's amazing what he can do
[1:00:57] in a matter of a minute he comes and
[1:01:00] changes their lives from doubters to
[1:01:03] people raising paralytics from people
[1:01:05] that are deniers to people that are
[1:01:07] silencing the crowds of theologians and
[1:01:10] intellectual Minds from men that are
[1:01:12] cussers to tongue talkers
[1:01:15] the ability of the word of God has
[1:01:17] destined you for greatness
[1:01:21] you can go to read in Acts chapter 17
[1:01:23] you'll find that the Bible declares that
[1:01:25] these people are those that turned the
[1:01:28] world upside down you see these were
[1:01:31] destined to overcome the very powers of
[1:01:34] hell
[1:01:35] but you see he didn't choose a perfect
[1:01:37] people he didn't choose a people that he
[1:01:39] didn't choose a people that had great
[1:01:41] names to him he didn't choose people of
[1:01:43] great little letter uh of intellects of
[1:01:45] that mind he chose the illiterate he
[1:01:48] chose the cast down he chose to reject
[1:01:50] it what did he do he chose a gentile
[1:01:53] people
[1:01:54] a pagan worshiper people that were a
[1:01:57] heathen Nations men that were cut off
[1:01:59] from God they were without Mercy they
[1:02:01] were without hope they were idle
[1:02:03] worshipers and they were on their way to
[1:02:05] a devil's hail and on their way to a
[1:02:07] sinner's grave but because the Bible
[1:02:09] said that he would take a people out of
[1:02:12] the Gentiles for his namesake he was
[1:02:14] coming for a people but they denied him
[1:02:17] but he came and said I'm going to take a
[1:02:19] people that will honor my name they will
[1:02:22] respect my name they will give glory to
[1:02:24] my name that's what William Branham said
[1:02:26] in the Statue of a perfect man Christ
[1:02:28] didn't send me to build he didn't send
[1:02:30] me to build a denomination but he sent
[1:02:32] me to build individuals to be a
[1:02:35] Powerhouse under the most high God men
[1:02:37] that would be Sons and Daughters of
[1:02:39] almighty God he may not have chose the
[1:02:41] best of the world but he chose the best
[1:02:43] in God
[1:02:45] because he elected you and for ordained
[1:02:48] you and destined you before the
[1:02:50] foundation of the world you see that's
[1:02:52] what God's doing today you were a people
[1:02:55] that was away from God and people that
[1:02:57] didn't know God but God is raising up a
[1:02:59] generation in this hour
[1:03:01] that will honor his name that will
[1:03:04] respect his name they know there ain't
[1:03:06] no other name given amongst men where
[1:03:08] men should be saved but by the name of
[1:03:11] Jesus Christ and you are exactly what
[1:03:14] the son of man is looking for
[1:03:19] said right you right you see there's a
[1:03:21] Divine intelligence that's looking out
[1:03:23] upon the elect and the unelected this
[1:03:25] generation you look at somebody and you
[1:03:28] take the word of God in your life you
[1:03:29] put it upon your lips and you watch that
[1:03:31] word of God how it's lived out of your
[1:03:34] life but you take somebody down the road
[1:03:36] have that same scripture but they can't
[1:03:38] live it out what is it it's not inspired
[1:03:41] of him to live out the scripture of that
[1:03:43] hour but to you that have been ordained
[1:03:46] to life you have been there is a Divine
[1:03:48] intelligence that is watching over your
[1:03:51] life that knows the difference between
[1:03:53] seed and non-seed
[1:03:56] how did you get here it's because the
[1:03:58] gene seed of God who is laying on the
[1:04:01] inside of your heart
[1:04:03] you look at you look at what the Bible
[1:04:05] said in Romans chapter 9 and 11 it tells
[1:04:08] us that before the children were ever
[1:04:10] born God loved Jacob and he hated Esau
[1:04:14] before Esau could do the right things
[1:04:16] before Jacob could ever make the right
[1:04:18] choices Jacob loved God loved Jacob
[1:04:22] because Jacob was a man
[1:04:27] yeah he wasn't no good yeah he was a
[1:04:30] shyster yeah he was a yeah he was a he
[1:04:33] was a bad dude he was full of
[1:04:35] shenanigans but Jacob had a desire he
[1:04:38] longed for the birthright and God loves
[1:04:41] the people that long after the Holy
[1:04:43] Ghost
[1:04:45] you see there was something that was
[1:04:47] there on the inside of Jacob we would
[1:04:49] say in Psalms 47 that it was a deeper of
[1:04:52] Psalms 42 that it was a deep that was
[1:04:54] calling to the Deep on the inside of
[1:04:56] Jacob that was going into operation why
[1:04:59] didn't Esau have it on the inside of him
[1:05:01] it's because God elected Jacob to have
[1:05:04] it
[1:05:05] God ordained Jacob to have it when it
[1:05:08] looked like the more righteous one was
[1:05:10] Esau when it looked like he was a better
[1:05:12] man when he looked more religious than
[1:05:14] anybody else
[1:05:16] he had a desire Jacob did
[1:05:20] lied to his father put on the coat of a
[1:05:22] goat walked in there and got the
[1:05:24] blessing Hallelujah
[1:05:27] because he was willing to sell out
[1:05:29] everything of the world just to get the
[1:05:31] birthright but you notice he saw he
[1:05:34] always does the same thing he will sell
[1:05:36] out his misapottage
[1:05:38] he'll sell out for a mess of pottage and
[1:05:41] he'll deny the very Holy Ghost
[1:05:44] you watch it watch what brother random
[1:05:46] says here he said the carnal believer
[1:05:48] today oh as long as I go to church and
[1:05:51] do what's and do what's right what
[1:05:53] difference does it make he said that's
[1:05:55] the Esau group he still makes fun and
[1:05:57] despises the birthright he doesn't care
[1:05:59] for it but Jacob loved it
[1:06:02] and the spiritual man today and the
[1:06:04] spiritual woman that's elected
[1:06:05] predestinated of God to come to eternal
[1:06:08] life if they have to sell everything
[1:06:09] they got if they got to take their names
[1:06:12] off of the every Church book in the
[1:06:14] nation still they want that Birthright
[1:06:16] it's the only thing that matters to them
[1:06:19] just get that Birthright that's all no
[1:06:21] matter how or what level they have to
[1:06:23] come on
[1:06:25] if they have to get down at the altar
[1:06:27] and cry and boohoo if they have to run
[1:06:30] through the places and go back and make
[1:06:32] things right and sell what they got or
[1:06:33] give away everything that they have and
[1:06:35] become a pilgrim and a stranger it don't
[1:06:38] matter they want that Birthright that's
[1:06:40] all they're interested in the birthright
[1:06:43] now I love this he said but don't you
[1:06:46] blame them people they can't help it
[1:06:48] they're predestinated to that they're
[1:06:50] elected to that don't you blame us when
[1:06:53] we get excited under the inspiration of
[1:06:55] the Holy Ghost when we get excited get
[1:06:58] emotional because the word don't you
[1:07:00] blame us we're elected to do it
[1:07:04] [Applause]
[1:07:06] we're elected to tear Satan's kingdom
[1:07:08] down we're elected to live this message
[1:07:11] don't blame us call us holy rollers tell
[1:07:15] us we lost a mind I don't care what you
[1:07:17] call them they're seeking that
[1:07:19] Birthright that means more to them than
[1:07:21] anything else they're after that
[1:07:23] Birthright no matter how they have to
[1:07:25] get it they are ready to get it
[1:07:30] it doesn't matter what you say about us
[1:07:32] it doesn't matter if you if you're
[1:07:34] standing there when Noah's up here and
[1:07:36] he was sitting there he said well you
[1:07:38] know what I said God said it's going to
[1:07:40] rain I better I better go out there and
[1:07:42] I better start building me an art just
[1:07:44] in case it does rain no Noah was under
[1:07:46] the inspiration
[1:07:48] he was under the inspiration of the word
[1:07:51] of the Lord and he went out there and
[1:07:53] started building an ark and people were
[1:07:54] calling him crazy they called him a Holy
[1:07:57] Roller but that didn't bother Noah
[1:08:00] he just kept on building and preaching
[1:08:04] you say Well they're all after your
[1:08:05] brother Andrew they say the message is
[1:08:07] dead and gone they can say what they
[1:08:09] want to but I'm building this Ark I'm
[1:08:12] getting in this heart of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:16] what was it Jacob had a knowledge of the
[1:08:20] birthright he knew what was laying in
[1:08:22] the blessings of the birthright you see
[1:08:24] the transfer of that Birthright to Jacob
[1:08:27] it meant that that Birthright secured to
[1:08:30] him who possessed it a superior rank in
[1:08:32] the family the possession of that
[1:08:34] Birthright was a double portion of the
[1:08:37] paternal inheritance in Deuteronomy 21
[1:08:40] and 17 it tells us that he shall
[1:08:43] acknowledge the son of the hated for the
[1:08:46] firstborn by giving him a double portion
[1:08:48] of all that he hath for he is the
[1:08:51] beginning of his strength the right of
[1:08:53] the firstborn is his so you acknowledge
[1:08:56] the firstborn by giving him a double
[1:08:59] portion notice What God Says in Numbers
[1:09:02] chapter 8 and 17 that all the firstborn
[1:09:05] of the children of Israel they're mine
[1:09:08] so God has something special for the
[1:09:12] firstborn
[1:09:14] there is a certain possession that is
[1:09:17] for the firstborn and Paul recognized
[1:09:20] the rights of the firstborn when he was
[1:09:22] standing there in Hebrews chapter 12 and
[1:09:25] 22 that you are coming to Mount Zion and
[1:09:28] under the city of the Living God the
[1:09:29] heavenly Jerusalem an innumerable
[1:09:31] company of angels to the general
[1:09:33] assembly and the Church of the firstborn
[1:09:36] what was Paul recognizing that you were
[1:09:39] not the second point but you're the
[1:09:41] first boy you received a kingdom that
[1:09:44] cannot be shook down
[1:09:47] what am I saying to you it's your
[1:09:49] god-given right to the double portion
[1:09:51] that's why Elisha asked for it that's
[1:09:54] why Elijah put himself in first place he
[1:09:57] recognized the power and the rank
[1:10:02] what did he do Elisha asked for the
[1:10:05] double portion before he ever seen the
[1:10:07] miracle
[1:10:10] you know good and well what you've been
[1:10:11] asking for what you've been asking for a
[1:10:14] double portion you've been asking for
[1:10:15] the Holy Ghost you've been asking for
[1:10:17] this situation and before you've seen
[1:10:19] the miracle you begin to ask for the
[1:10:21] double portion it's your god-given right
[1:10:24] for the double portion but brother
[1:10:26] random said in second-handed robe he
[1:10:28] said there's an if laying in there that
[1:10:30] if you see me when I go
[1:10:32] that you'll have this double portion
[1:10:34] brother random said he said if you chase
[1:10:36] it down he said there's an if laying in
[1:10:38] there in Mark chapter 9 and 23 if thou
[1:10:41] can'tst believe all things are possible
[1:10:44] to them that believe there's an if in
[1:10:47] there
[1:10:48] but we are destined to win the battle
[1:10:53] oh good lord of Mercy it's your legal
[1:10:57] possession
[1:10:59] William Branham said aren't you happy
[1:11:00] tonight to know that you're baptized in
[1:11:03] the Church of the firstborn of the
[1:11:04] Living God that the very same spirit
[1:11:06] that was in Christ is in the church and
[1:11:08] you are part of it by the Holy Ghost
[1:11:10] being dead in Christ take on Abraham's
[1:11:12] seed and heirs according to the promise
[1:11:14] he said what are you scared about
[1:11:17] what are you scared about all devils in
[1:11:20] Hell couldn't shake you why can't they
[1:11:22] shake you you're the Church of the
[1:11:24] firstborn
[1:11:27] you received a kingdom that cannot be
[1:11:30] shook
[1:11:32] Hallelujah we know what that word
[1:11:35] overcome means it means to conquer
[1:11:37] it means the Vanquish it means to subdue
[1:11:39] as as to overcome an enemy in the battle
[1:11:45] it means to get the better off
[1:11:49] Hallelujah
[1:11:50] Hallelujah it means to overcome
[1:11:52] difficulties it means to overcome
[1:11:54] obstacles it means overflow and it means
[1:11:58] the surcharge it means to come upon and
[1:12:00] it means to invade and there is an army
[1:12:03] of hell that has come against the Church
[1:12:06] of the Living God but we are here to
[1:12:08] invade the enemy's camp and take back
[1:12:10] what is rightfully ours as the elect and
[1:12:13] Jean seed of God we are facing every
[1:12:15] devil out of hell you know that when the
[1:12:18] seals were released that two hundred
[1:12:20] thousand thousand demons were released
[1:12:22] out of the river of Euphrates right here
[1:12:25] in Satan's Eden God's choosing some
[1:12:27] Overcomers
[1:12:29] God's choosing a people that are
[1:12:31] predestinated to life
[1:12:33] come on somebody you may not look right
[1:12:36] to the world you may not act like to the
[1:12:38] world but God chose you
[1:12:41] right here in Satan's Eden God's
[1:12:44] Building a body God's putting his very
[1:12:46] own life in there what did he do he
[1:12:48] dropped the headship of the knowledge of
[1:12:50] Jesus Christ right into the body and you
[1:12:53] know all the way back there in the
[1:12:54] Garden of Eden that there we know that
[1:12:56] there will be enmity between the seeds
[1:12:59] of the woman's seed and the serpent seed
[1:13:01] and you watch out of every Revival there
[1:13:04] comes two twins you notice it comes
[1:13:07] twins out of every Revival Abel and Cain
[1:13:11] he saw when Jacob Jesus and the
[1:13:13] Antichrist Jesus and Judas look at the
[1:13:15] anointed one now and the false anointed
[1:13:18] one what is it the conflict is
[1:13:20] continuing through every Revival
[1:13:23] now you watched right here tonight
[1:13:25] there's the power of faith that is
[1:13:27] operating in here at the free moral
[1:13:29] Familia free moral agency of your soul
[1:13:32] that you are choosing to believe
[1:13:35] it's amazing what is happening in this
[1:13:37] room you don't even feel it you may not
[1:13:39] even see it but there is a people that
[1:13:41] is making a choice
[1:13:44] and what does it do it causes the pillar
[1:13:46] of fire to circle the building when
[1:13:48] somebody goes into conflict with the
[1:13:51] power of Satan and they say amen I
[1:13:54] believe that what is it we are right
[1:13:57] here in Satan's Eden but we're not here
[1:13:59] to be silenced and we're not here to be
[1:14:01] shut up we're here to put our faith in
[1:14:04] action and right here in the realm of
[1:14:06] your soul
[1:14:07] you are selling your destiny by the
[1:14:10] power of the word
[1:14:13] oh
[1:14:16] come on don't get out of here devil
[1:14:21] we say what are you doing brother Angel
[1:14:23] I'm simply preaching a word and if I can
[1:14:25] preach the word and your faith can be
[1:14:27] built up to believe that you're destined
[1:14:29] to overcome every Cancer cell every
[1:14:32] demonic power every situation what are
[1:14:35] you doing brother Angel you're working
[1:14:36] or something no I'm just preaching it

[1:14:40] preach you up
[1:14:42] what are you doing brother Andrew I'm
[1:14:45] simply preaching what William Branham
[1:14:47] told us to preach
[1:14:52] but you don't understand how dark it is
[1:14:53] brother Andrew sure I do sure I do
[1:14:56] before you ever got here God had a
[1:14:58] prophet on the scene and told us how
[1:15:00] dark of a day that we're living in
[1:15:03] you notice what brother random Mooney
[1:15:05] begins to address the Church of the
[1:15:07] Living God in 1964 he begins to address
[1:15:10] the church he said now notice he said my
[1:15:13] my New Year's message is to the church
[1:15:15] elected in Jesus Christ he said not just
[1:15:18] a church group but the elect the elect
[1:15:20] Lady of the church Christ bride he said
[1:15:24] that's who I'm addressing but William
[1:15:27] Branham goes back in there and he breaks
[1:15:29] in to the ultimate Old Testament and he
[1:15:32] goes in there to Isaiah 60 and 1. arise
[1:15:36] and shine for thy light has come and the
[1:15:39] glory of the Lord has risen upon thee
[1:15:41] but notice what William Branham said he
[1:15:44] said but there is a contrast that is
[1:15:46] going on it's a mystery of life and
[1:15:49] darkness verse 2 says and there would be
[1:15:51] gross darkness that would come upon the
[1:15:54] land and be upon the people
[1:15:56] hallelujah hallelujah but the Lord
[1:16:00] shall arise upon me and His glory shall
[1:16:03] be seen upon thee what is it we are
[1:16:06] living right here in the blending of
[1:16:09] time and the blending of Eternity
[1:16:12] what is it he said that's my address to
[1:16:15] the church it's dark out there brother
[1:16:17] Andrew I know that
[1:16:19] it's a mixed up world out there I know
[1:16:22] that but William branham's message to

[1:16:51] times of Darkness he said that we've
[1:16:53] ever stood in but yet we're standing in
[1:16:55] the Most Blessed light that ever did
[1:16:57] Shine

[1:17:24] how can you have peace by I'll tell you
[1:17:27] how we can have peace it's because

[1:20:02] the power over death and he's got the
[1:20:04] power over life that's what he's to
[1:20:06] proved to us that he wasn't only the
[1:20:09] word but it was the Dynamics in the word
[1:20:12] he can take a cold dead body laying
[1:20:15] there in his former condition and he can
[1:20:16] breathe life into it and say I am he
[1:20:19] that was dead and I Am Alive forevermore

[1:21:00] hide him in a tomb they tried to seal it
[1:21:02] up there with a Roman seal but there's
[1:21:05] only one seal that can't be broken and
[1:21:07] it's a seal of the Holy Ghost and Satan
[1:21:09] cannot break that seal he can try to
[1:21:12] cover you up with sin he can try to
[1:21:14] cover you up with lies he can try to
[1:21:16] cover up your family history of DNA
[1:21:18] things back there but Easter proved he
[1:21:21] was great enough to cover all of your
[1:21:24] sins
[1:21:26] that's what William Branham said in the
[1:21:28] message of restoration of laboratory he
[1:21:30] said what was it he said he said Easter
[1:21:33] means to restore back to bring it back
[1:21:36] and he said there that Little Flower

[1:22:47] rising of the sun notice when Jacob
[1:22:49] Jacob knew there was a blessing with the
[1:22:51] birthright and when he got on the other
[1:22:53] side of the river and he's over there
[1:22:55] wrestling with the angel
[1:22:57] what was it he said tell me what your
[1:22:59] name is he said I'm not going to let you
[1:23:01] go until you bless me because Jacob knew
[1:23:03] that there was a blessing that was
[1:23:05] coming with the birthright it may not
[1:23:07] have seemed like Jacob was blessed but
[1:23:09] when he got in this conference with an
[1:23:11] angel and he said I'm not going to let
[1:23:13] you go till you bless me there's that
[1:23:15] kind of people that are sitting here
[1:23:16] tonight Lord I'm not going to let you
[1:23:18] pass by my way don't you pass me alone

[1:23:23] I ain't gonna let you go until you bless
[1:23:25] me

[1:23:30] breaking of the day that the angel
[1:23:32] touched Jacob that he was no longer
[1:23:34] Jacob but he was Israel what is this it
[1:23:38] is a rising of the sun it's Sunday again
[1:23:43] oh blessed be the name of the Lord what
[1:23:46] are you talking about I'm talking about
[1:23:48] the people that are not a part of this
[1:23:50] world chaos
[1:23:54] notice what Paul says here in Colossians
[1:23:57] 3 when he writes the letter to the
[1:23:59] Colossians
[1:24:00] he said If any man or if you then been
[1:24:03] risen with Christ seek those things
[1:24:06] which are above where Christ sitteth on
[1:24:09] the right hand of God set your affection
[1:24:11] on things above not on the things
[1:24:19] for you are dead and your life is hid
[1:24:22] with Christ in God everybody all right
[1:24:26] when Christ who is our life shall appear
[1:24:30] then shall you also appear with him in
[1:24:33] glory now notice he said now mortify
[1:24:36] Therefore your members which are upon
[1:24:38] the Earth fornication uncleanness
[1:24:39] inordinate affection evil can keep a
[1:24:42] sense in covetness which is idolatry for
[1:24:44] things for which things seek the wrath
[1:24:47] of God cometh on the children of
[1:24:49] disobedience in the which he also walked
[1:24:52] sometime when you lived in them but now
[1:24:54] you are also put off oh no but now ye
[1:24:58] also put off this anger put off these
[1:25:01] anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy
[1:25:04] communication out of your mouth lie not
[1:25:06] one unto another seeing that you have
[1:25:08] put off the old man with his deeds and
[1:25:12] have put on the new man which is renewed
[1:25:15] in the knowledge after the image
[1:25:19] him that created him
[1:25:22] now when William Branham preaches images
[1:25:24] of Christ he stands there he said he
[1:25:27] said the person that's dealing with
[1:25:28] sickness he said they're the person that
[1:25:30] needs attention
[1:25:32] there the person who needs attention and
[1:25:34] he said you look at this whole world he
[1:25:36] said he said you see them he said you
[1:25:39] see them they're big eyes and a little
[1:25:40] use he said he said you see them he said
[1:25:42] the people that need attention is the
[1:25:44] ones that are sick the sickest ones are
[1:25:46] the ones that need attention he said but
[1:25:48] you watch he said what it is he said
[1:25:50] it's spiritual anemiath that is upon the
[1:25:53] people he said what it is he said he
[1:25:55] gets somebody that's anemic that's got
[1:25:57] low blood he said they need a
[1:25:59] transfusion he said you watch somebody
[1:26:01] that's low on blood he said they get
[1:26:03] tipsy Topsy and they wobble back and
[1:26:05] forth and you watch people that'll
[1:26:07] wobble back and forth between faith and
[1:26:09] doubt what is it they need a blood
[1:26:11] transfusion that came from Calvary
[1:26:14] what will it do it'll make you stable in
[1:26:16] the word it'll make you steadfast in
[1:26:18] your faith it'll make you unconquered by
[1:26:21] Traditions it'll make you stand here as
[1:26:23] a real overcomer
[1:26:26] but you got to put off the old
[1:26:28] and you gotta put on the new if you go
[1:26:31] to studying that out in the Greek it
[1:26:33] means to put off it means to lay aside
[1:26:35] it means to lay down it means to cast
[1:26:37] off
[1:26:40] but if you go to studying put on
[1:26:47] it means to be clothed with
[1:26:50] it means to be clothed in it means to
[1:26:53] have on it means to be endued it means
[1:26:56] to be a raid it means to be clothed in
[1:26:58] what do you do you put off the old
[1:27:01] you cast off the old that's why Paul was
[1:27:04] standing there in Hebrews chapter 12 and
[1:27:06] he said let us therefore lay aside put
[1:27:09] off lay aside every weight and sin that
[1:27:12] does so easily beset us and let us run
[1:27:15] this race with patience what are you
[1:27:17] doing the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:27:20] your wedding garment and you put it on
[1:27:23] you cast off the old man and you put on
[1:27:26] the new that's what Jesus said when he
[1:27:28] was standing there in Luke 24 and 49 he
[1:27:31] said behold I send the promise of my
[1:27:33] father upon you but tarry you in the
[1:27:35] city until you be endued
[1:27:40] with power
[1:27:42] don't you go nowhere
[1:27:44] until you're being dude well I'm ready
[1:27:46] to witness have you received the Holy
[1:27:48] Ghost since you believed be and do to
[1:27:51] put on
[1:27:52] the power
[1:27:54] what did he say in Romans 13 and 12 that
[1:27:57] the night is far spent and the day is at
[1:27:59] hand let us therefore put off cast off
[1:28:03] the works of darkness and let us put on
[1:28:07] oh let us put on the arm of light arise
[1:28:11] and shine for thy light has come
[1:28:14] but put ye on
[1:28:18] the Lord Jesus and make not provision
[1:28:20] for the flesh
[1:28:23] to fulfill

[1:29:39] struggle with sin of this world put it
[1:29:41] off so you can put it on

[1:29:50] dead and Christ shall be raised
[1:29:52] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:29:55] for this corruptable must put on
[1:29:58] incorruption and this Mortal shall put
[1:30:01] on immortality so when the corruptable
[1:30:03] has put on Icarus
[1:30:06] and this Mortal shall have put on
[1:30:08] immortality then shall be brought to
[1:30:11] pass a saying that is written death
[1:30:15] is swallowed up in Victory so what am I
[1:30:18] saying to you that the Dynamics of the
[1:30:20] groom is being endued with power
[1:30:26] getting it like that one
[1:30:30] that's what William Branham said and
[1:30:32] what shall I do with Jesus he said the
[1:30:34] Dynamics of this church will be a
[1:30:36] refilling of the Holy Spirit
[1:30:39] come on now Jacob you know you're born
[1:30:42] for it
[1:30:43] get upset all you want to but you're
[1:30:45] born for it lie you want to but you're
[1:30:48] born for it
[1:30:50] mama says you can have it daddy says you
[1:30:53] can't have it but you're born for it
[1:30:55] the world says you can't have it but
[1:30:57] you're born for it you're built to be an
[1:31:00] overcomer right here right now
[1:31:03] I'm talking to a people that is not
[1:31:05] destined for destruction
[1:31:09] you're destined to receive the gift of
[1:31:12] almighty God
[1:31:14] brother man when he comes to this
[1:31:16] scripture of Revelations 3
[1:31:18] in Ephesian church or in the church age
[1:31:21] book excuse me he said now what are we
[1:31:23] to overcome he said that is a normal
[1:31:24] question to ask here he said but that is
[1:31:27] not the actual thought of this verse he
[1:31:29] said it's not so much what we are to
[1:31:31] overcome but how we are to overcome he
[1:31:34] said now that is logical for does it
[1:31:36] matter how much matter much what we are
[1:31:39] to come overcome as long as we know how
[1:31:41] we can overcome my brother Andrew I've
[1:31:44] been struggling real bad lately I've
[1:31:46] been serving the lord real hard lately
[1:31:48] and I just I had to go out and do a
[1:31:49] little bit of sin how am I going to be
[1:31:51] an overcomer how am I going to be a
[1:31:53] winner I feel like I go down to the
[1:31:54] Altar and I get a touch from the Lord
[1:31:56] but I still can't overcome how do you
[1:31:58] overcome the same way that Jesus
[1:32:00] overcome by applying the word of God to
[1:32:03] every situation
[1:32:08] come on now
[1:32:09] how many times have you walked to the
[1:32:11] altar how many times have I watched
[1:32:13] young girls and young boys walk to the
[1:32:15] altar with the same Condition it's
[1:32:16] because they never received nothing in
[1:32:18] the first place
[1:32:19] but if you can ever meet him one time if
[1:32:22] you can never meet the god that I'm hit
[1:32:24] You'll Never Walk Away the same way
[1:32:27] come on now there's no way that Jacob
[1:32:30] could not talk about his experience
[1:32:32] after he wrestled it out
[1:32:36] come on now you can sit there and say
[1:32:38] well I'm not going to tell nobody about
[1:32:39] my Holy Ghost let me tell you they'll
[1:32:41] notice about it they'll there's not a
[1:32:44] time that anybody didn't recognize that
[1:32:46] that Jacob had been touched by the angel
[1:32:48] why because the angel touched the inner
[1:32:52] part of his thigh that's where the
[1:32:53] promise is given
[1:32:55] that's where the covenant's at what did
[1:32:58] he do he walked different the rest of
[1:33:00] the days of his life you can say you're
[1:33:01] going to whisper about it say you're not
[1:33:03] going to tell nobody about it that's
[1:33:05] that's sure proof you never got nothing
[1:33:07] in the first place
[1:33:12] won't you be ashamed of him
[1:33:15] won't you be ashamed of your walk don't
[1:33:17] you be ashamed of your dress don't you
[1:33:18] be ashamed of how the message makes you
[1:33:19] talk you have been elected to rise above
[1:33:22] every situation and the only way they're
[1:33:24] going to be an overcomer is to live like
[1:33:26] Jesus lived and when the enemy comes in
[1:33:29] there when troubles arise take the word
[1:33:31] of God when sickness is screaming at you
[1:33:34] take the word of God when hell is turned
[1:33:36] loose on you take the word of God you
[1:33:39] have been chosen
[1:33:41] to rise above every demonic power
[1:33:45] foreign
[1:33:47] I'm not strong enough
[1:33:49] I wish you'd stop saying it
[1:33:51] I'm not good enough I wish you change
[1:33:53] your language I don't know if I can be
[1:33:56] called and I can be elected I wish you
[1:33:58] change your language because God has
[1:34:00] deposited a part of himself on the
[1:34:02] inside of you Abraham you may look like
[1:34:04] you're too old you may feel like you're
[1:34:07] too old but God deposited a part of
[1:34:09] himself on the inside of you that way
[1:34:11] you know you're going to make it you'll
[1:34:13] be able to produce an Isaac when Elohim
[1:34:15] gets done with you
[1:34:17] come on now you're going to be an
[1:34:18] overcomer because Elohim deposited a
[1:34:21] gene seed of God on the inside of you
[1:34:22] you have the genos of your father that
[1:34:25] is laying there you see your power is
[1:34:28] laying right there in the name
[1:34:31] Jehovah
[1:34:34] your power is laying right there in the
[1:34:38] name Jehovah
[1:34:40] because brother random tells us in the
[1:34:42] adoption series he said but in Genesis
[1:34:44] chapter 2 he said when he made man he
[1:34:46] said I am Jehovah what did it mean that
[1:34:50] I am the all-existent one who has
[1:34:53] created something off of myself to be a
[1:34:56] son of mine or a temporary or an amateur
[1:34:59] little one of mine he said oh why he
[1:35:03] gave Jehovah means that he gave man to
[1:35:06] be an amateur God
[1:35:09] Jehovah means that he gave man to be an
[1:35:12] amateur God because he is the father God
[1:35:15] and he made man to be an amateur God so
[1:35:17] he isn't self-existence anymore
[1:35:21] he exists with his family amen Helen
[1:35:24] Elohim now that is Jehovah Jehovah
[1:35:28] meaning that the one who exists now with
[1:35:32] his family
[1:35:33] so God made man to be predominant over
[1:35:36] all the Earth
[1:35:38] stop saying you can't do it
[1:35:41] because Jehovah said you could
[1:35:44] stop saying I'm not elect stop saying
[1:35:46] I'm not qualified Jehovah said you are
[1:35:48] God made man to be predominant over all
[1:35:52] of the Earth
[1:35:53] he was sitting there in a perfect
[1:35:54] paradise and she still failed she was
[1:35:57] still deceived but you're standing right
[1:35:59] here in Satan's Eden and you're
[1:36:01] overcoming
[1:36:04] what happened in Portland Oregon when
[1:36:05] that Maniac come running at him and said
[1:36:07] I'm gonna make you I'm gonna break every
[1:36:09] bow every bone in your body
[1:36:11] what did he do William Brown didn't back
[1:36:13] off of his promises he stood there and
[1:36:16] he loved that man he loved that man what
[1:36:19] was he he was predominant over all the
[1:36:22] Earth that Maniac could have said one
[1:36:24] thing he said but tonight William
[1:36:26] Branham said tonight you're going to Bow
[1:36:28] over my feet
[1:36:30] that man hauled off and spit in brother
[1:36:32] Brandon's face
[1:36:34] but when there came such a rush of the
[1:36:37] Holy Ghost he said Satan come out of the
[1:36:40] man and the man fell on William random's
[1:36:42] feet
[1:36:44] there was two police officers there
[1:36:45] standing there he said ASAP man
[1:36:47] delivered he said no he worships that
[1:36:49] thing and as long as you worship your
[1:36:51] sickness as long as you worship yourself
[1:36:53] pity party you're going to lay there in
[1:36:55] the same condition
[1:36:57] but if you can say Lord help me get up
[1:37:00] out of my condition break my power of
[1:37:03] hardness by The Power of Love
[1:37:07] love overcomes all things love prevails
[1:37:11] love knows no evil love sees no fault
[1:37:15] he said when I loved him
[1:37:20] it's powerful
[1:37:22] it's powerful
[1:37:24] and he said I stood there said could you
[1:37:26] roll them off my feet so I can go back
[1:37:28] to preaching and he said as I was saying
[1:37:30] I am the Lord thy God that heals all of
[1:37:33] thy diseases and he said all of a sudden
[1:37:34] somebody jumped out a wheelchair
[1:37:35] somebody jumped out of a God he said
[1:37:37] what was it he said all them little
[1:37:39] demons had watched the chief of the
[1:37:41] tribe of the Demons of Hell they'd seen
[1:37:43] that God accepted a challenge and the
[1:37:45] Demons of hailed the tribe of Hell had
[1:37:48] lost the challenge what was it it was a
[1:37:50] sign that all hell was conquered if you
[1:37:52] can conquer this one you can conquer it
[1:37:55] all and you are here and predominant
[1:37:57] over everything the Church of the Living
[1:37:59] God has the power to cast Satan down you
[1:38:02] are called to defeat the enemy and there
[1:38:04] is nothing going to stop you no sickness
[1:38:06] will hold you no depression will
[1:38:08] restrain you no devil will bind you no
[1:38:11] power in hell is going to stop you you
[1:38:13] are elected to bind the mama you are
[1:38:15] elected to bind that serpent you
[1:38:18] or a chosen generation a royal
[1:38:21] priesthood
[1:38:22] a people that was away from God but a
[1:38:25] people that is near to God and the word
[1:38:27] of God is in my mouth and it is powerful
[1:38:34] you don't know what I've been diagnosed
[1:38:36] with let me tell you a diagnosis is not
[1:38:39] a verdict
[1:38:40] we serve a God that dissolves nodules we
[1:38:42] serve a God that dissolves tumors we
[1:38:44] serve a God that can create squirrels we
[1:38:47] serve a God that can that can cast out
[1:38:49] Spirits we serve a God that can call
[1:38:51] down storms we consider a God that can
[1:38:53] raise up storms we are a people that
[1:38:56] have believed the report and the whom
[1:38:58] the arm of the Lord is revealed we
[1:39:00] believe this message we believe this
[1:39:03] power
[1:39:04] I've been diagnosed with a bad sickness
[1:39:06] you are commissioned to pray your
[1:39:09] commissioned to lay your hands on the
[1:39:10] sick your commission to believe
[1:39:13] come on now arise and shine out your
[1:39:16] unbelief
[1:39:17] arise and shock William Branham said
[1:39:20] never permit a negative thought to come
[1:39:21] in your mind if you can help it when it
[1:39:24] starts that don't entertain it never let
[1:39:26] a negative thought pass through don't
[1:39:28] let it stop anyhow if it starts to keep
[1:39:30] your thoughts positive
[1:39:34] don't think sitting there in that
[1:39:35] wheelchair that you go you're hopeless
[1:39:37] and you're helpless you're not don't let
[1:39:40] that negative thought ever pass through
[1:39:41] don't let it anchor you can't help it
[1:39:44] from going through your mind but don't
[1:39:46] let it stop there don't think that kind
[1:39:48] of negative thought don't let it go
[1:39:50] through your mind make every word
[1:39:52] positive and every thought positive
[1:39:57] again and while I'm praying and speaking
[1:39:59] I want every person in here to have this
[1:40:02] in your mind that as soon as your prayer
[1:40:04] as prayer begins to go for the sick
[1:40:06] every one of you is going to get up and
[1:40:08] walk out of here out of the building
[1:40:09] well don't have nothing else in your
[1:40:12] mind keep thinking that if there be any
[1:40:14] praise if there be any virtue think on
[1:40:17] these things you cannot get anything
[1:40:19] from God with a negative thought
[1:40:23] oh man I'm feeling good up here he that
[1:40:26] cometh the God must believe that he is
[1:40:28] and he's a rewarder of them that
[1:40:30] diligently seek them you say well
[1:40:31] brother Andrew I thought I never could
[1:40:33] have thought I thought something wrong
[1:40:34] rethink that thought you're more than a
[1:40:38] match for Satan
[1:40:39] Satan's power is a limited he's like a
[1:40:43] dog on a chain he can only go so far
[1:40:46] he's got limited access to you
[1:40:49] you see if you're going to get into
[1:40:50] certain areas of certain locations
[1:40:52] you've got to have an access card and
[1:40:54] Satan does not have access to your soul
[1:40:56] once you are sealed until the day of
[1:40:59] your Redemption
[1:41:00] he can war with your mind he can war
[1:41:03] with your flesh but he cannot touch the
[1:41:05] gene seed of God because you're destined
[1:41:07] to win the battle you're destined to
[1:41:09] overcome you're destined to be healed
[1:41:11] you're destined for the Rapture you're
[1:41:14] destined to be an overcomer
[1:41:16] I am more than a conqueror through Jesus
[1:41:20] Christ who lives on the inside of me
[1:41:23] said he was with me and I believe him he
[1:41:26] said he'd go for me and I believe him he
[1:41:28] said he was behind me and I believe him
[1:41:31] Satan cannot touch one hair of my head
[1:41:35] I'm destined to win

[1:41:50] for you're destined to have it
[1:41:57] what are you saying brother Andrew I'm
[1:41:59] saying Satan take your dirty hands off
[1:42:02] of God's Property he may attack you with
[1:42:04] tumors he may attack you with high blood
[1:42:06] pressure he may attack you with sugar
[1:42:08] diabetes he may attack you in your mind
[1:42:10] but remember he's just a dog on a chain
[1:42:13] and when God goes to holding them back
[1:42:15] take your hands
[1:42:19] [Applause]
[1:42:20] it can only go so far it can only touch
[1:42:23] you so much
[1:42:24] [Applause]
[1:42:27] the devil ain't got one legal right at
[1:42:30] all nowhere he's just the Devil he's
[1:42:32] just a password that's all he's got no
[1:42:34] legal right to any man that'll accept
[1:42:36] the promise of Jesus Christ he's whipped
[1:42:38] he's whipped in sickness he's whipped in
[1:42:41] disappointments he's whipped in
[1:42:42] everything he's whipped in death he
[1:42:45] can't scare me he can't scare you that's
[1:42:47] all he is a big old shadow
[1:42:56] he'll burn them I'm closing
[1:43:02] I'm closing brother random when he goes
[1:43:04] and preaches how can I overcome
[1:43:06] he said did you did you understand the
[1:43:08] arrangements of that scripture that he
[1:43:11] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[1:43:12] me in my Throne he said he didn't say on
[1:43:15] my Throne he said but in my Throne he
[1:43:17] said a kingdom he said it is a domon a
[1:43:20] domain and he said he said a king
[1:43:25] a king
[1:43:26] it's his domain and he said his domain
[1:43:30] reaches from eternity to Eternity so I'm
[1:43:33] saying to you that we're right here at
[1:43:36] the blending of time and the blending of
[1:43:38] Eternity
[1:43:39] this is not Satan's domain you might be
[1:43:42] in Satan's Eden but this is not Satan's
[1:43:45] domain
[1:43:46] you don't have to live under his attacks
[1:43:48] you don't even have to live under his
[1:43:50] negative thoughts you don't have to live
[1:43:51] under his mindset you don't have to live
[1:43:53] under his criticism that can call you a
[1:43:56] Holy Roller that can always make fun but
[1:43:59] if they ever felt like we felt
[1:44:04] now look a king is not a a King Without
[1:44:08] a domain and if you do not let him reign
[1:44:10] in your heart he has no domain but the
[1:44:13] reason I'm preaching to you there is a
[1:44:16] domain it shows that there is a kingdom
[1:44:18] that is here
[1:44:22] the kingdom of sickness cannot Reign
[1:44:24] over top of your mortal bodies
[1:44:27] you're never too old for Divine Healing
[1:44:29] you're never do hold for a touch from
[1:44:32] the Lord
[1:44:35] William Bynum would say how are we going
[1:44:37] to believe in a Rapture if we can't even
[1:44:38] believe in Divine Healing he was not
[1:44:40] saying if you don't get if you get
[1:44:42] sick and you can't overcome it it does
[1:44:43] not mean that you're not going to make
[1:44:45] the Rapture he's saying to you how can
[1:44:47] you make the Rapture if you don't
[1:44:49] believe in Divine Healing and if you do
[1:44:51] believe in Divine Healing
[1:44:54] I got these old glasses right here and I
[1:44:57] have to wear them I have to wear
[1:44:59] contacts but just because I have to wear
[1:45:01] them does not mean that I don't believe
[1:45:03] in Divine Healing it just means I'm
[1:45:05] under a dynamic curse that I'm here I'm
[1:45:07] living under the fall of Adam but I
[1:45:09] believe in Divine Healing I believe that
[1:45:12] I can be healed I believe that all
[1:45:13] things are possible so I believe that
[1:45:16] I'm built for the rapture
[1:45:20] I believe your children can get the Holy
[1:45:22] Ghost
[1:45:28] I believe
[1:45:31] why not let peace reign in your heart
[1:45:33] [Applause]

[1:45:39] give the priest to almighty God

[1:46:09] you're more than a match

[1:46:23] certain things in your family history
[1:46:25] that are laying there in your DNA
[1:46:29] that are going to pass down through the
[1:46:31] lineage of your of your DNA they're just
[1:46:33] going to be there
[1:46:35] are things in my family heritage
[1:46:38] [Music]
[1:46:40] Family Heritage that I couldn't overcome
[1:46:42] on my own but there are things laying
[1:46:44] there in my spiritual DNA
[1:46:46] [Music]
[1:46:48] I never lost a battle according to my
[1:46:51] spiritual DNA there's never been a case
[1:46:53] too hard according to my spiritual DNA
[1:46:55] there's not a mountain too high
[1:46:57] according to my spiritual DNA there's
[1:46:59] not a valley too low that is according
[1:47:01] to my spirit your spiritual DNA but if
[1:47:03] I'm looking at my natural DNA there's a
[1:47:05] whole lot of things that are going to
[1:47:06] upset this old man right here that's why
[1:47:08] you got to put it off
[1:47:10] so you can put it on

[1:50:34] a baptism of the Holy Ghost that is not
[1:50:37] like Samson's anointing it would come
[1:50:38] and it would go but the anointing that
[1:50:40] you have received is an Everlasting
[1:50:43] Covenant

[1:50:47] devil's hell
