========================================

d-man well tonight is a very special night tonight you get to hear foreign ministers speak sister Debbie asked us earlier said now is this gonna be a watch night service sister Katie's mother I looked across the tables are you kidding sorry but not if that's what you came expecting no each each of the ministers are planning on taking about 15 minutes Lord willing if he's willing for more we'll just give them our way amen but for for our musicians and any of the audience of course but if you could just stay stay close to them musical equipment if you would have to use the restroom go ahead and use it but we are going to continue to go to each minister tonight so I'm gonna go first tonight and you just pray with me tonight amen and before we go to the Scriptures what asked brother Randy Hinkle if he would just thank God for the offering and just thank God for the reading of the word tonight you can be seated at this moment I'm gonna go to my scriptures and then continue one from there what a wonderful time in the Lord we've already had this evening we can say that we've truly have Church already but now we're getting to the good part over this over the past year and 2019 we've seen many things happened at this church now I'm not talking about the other churches and message what I'm talking about this church at this church I can see revival has set in but we don't want that - revival - stay right here where we're at in 2019 but we wanted to rollover into 2020 and we wanted to continue to build and build and build amen we've had people - to sing that has never seen before we have people that's that stood up and clapped their hands that has never stood up and clapped their hands before you know when I when we was little growing up in the church hey you know there was nothing to have a shouting service but to stand up and clout and clap and shout the reading of the words you know it's just it's just great does my heart great joy and I remember my son Titus and as he was one of the the first ones that I did not teach him to do this at home period so don't think that I told Titus as Titus utin you need to stand up in church and he'd clap your hands you need praise Lord none that is the way he got that from examples and these these examples have set examples throughout the years and it's beginning to overflow out from the teacups onto the saucers and we're beginning to sip from the saucers amen so tonight I want to read from Isaiah 60:1 and then I want to be going over to Luke 4 so we're gonna be reading Isaiah 61 and verse 1 just say hey man when you have it tonight we know Isaiah is one of the greater prophets that wrote had many writings in the Bible and proclaims of the the Christ Jesus as his his Advent would come in Isaiah 61 it says in the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for the mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified that is why we're here tonight we're here to give God the glory in every single way this is not to give man praise at all this is only for God amen in order to read in Luke 4 and this is where Jesus has has been up on the mountain of temptation and the devil has tempted him here and he's coming down off the mountain into Galilee and he came into Nazareth verse 16 for 16 says and it came and he came into Nazareth where he had been brought up and his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read and there was delivered unto Him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives I want you to put your name in each of these places where he is preaching to you this is all for you the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance unto the captives and Toorak and recovering of sight to the blind and set at liberty them that are bruised and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord now this is what I like here and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and he set down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him can you just imagine what he is read that Isaiah had written years and years ago [Applause] brokenhearted to preach deliverance there's been many many priests that's been in the synagogue's and here's Jesus setting and he then says this day this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears they have waited for this moment all these years and then they receive it and he says this day proclaim that this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears if you haven't heard it you're hearing it now he has come to heal the brokenhearted see I was captive I was bound how many of you have been captive you have been bound by the wages of sin that you held that was against you but he has come see I had felt the spirit of heaviness the spirit of laodicea that creeps in and just feels like there's a gravitational pull that continues just try to hold you back but he has come to loose that to give you praise garments of praise so we can stand up in this church and we can thank God for everything that he has given us we can sing praises unto the Lord we can clap our hands and guru you devil you are a liar again [Applause] and we have felt this day after day night after night and many times it might not even be for yourself maybe it's for your loved ones there's ones that you know need to come in and you want to see them come in and that heaviness is upon you how many times have we heard it proclaimed over this past year drive down those states drive them down let that spirit of heaviness be lifted amen there's a song that says two coats I've got I've had two coats maybe some of you've heard it Jeremiah Yocum sings it says ones was old and ugly but the other one was new I use to be a sinner I used to have a coat that was raggedy and worn but I took off this old coat and I put on the nude this first man was earthly and made from the ground and we bore all his image the whole world around I'm quoting the the song Anquan sing I can't be like Andrew breaking the psalm in the middle of nowhere but the next was my savior from heaven so fair he brought me this new coat you now see me wear so I'll tell you what I do I took off this old coat and I put on the noon if you're wearing that old coat tonight take that old coat of bondage off and put on the move cuz that's what we're here to do it's put on that new garment of praise amen amen [Applause] brother Branham says it here in the mark of the beast it says notice every slave when he heard that trumpet sound I think how great that is today sister Heather was feeling led upon her heart to sing that song ain't no grief got two dads and he said hey have them sing a song ain't no grave tonight and I knew what I was speaking of so okay well that can't be done and when he he heard that trumpet sound he could throw down his hole or whatever he was working with and say I am a free man I couldn't redeem myself but God through His grace has declared the year of Jubilee therefore I believed God and I don't have to work anymore the laws of the land claimed him free what a beautiful type of today we were bound but now we're free we poor aliens to do nothing we could keep every Sabbath every new moon quit eating meat we could keep all kinds of days and done all kinds of things of religious sacrifices that and we are under a load we are sold and sin our parents or descends sin in the Garden of Eden we are laden under the bonds of sin and slave to the devil we are born in sin shapen iniquity coming to the world speaking lies there is nothing we could do to help ourselves cause our whole makeup our whole nature and everything we are is sin amen but when the Jubilee time come when we are free that trumpet of the gospel is the good news the gospel is the good news the trumpet was the gospel then the good news you're no longer bound you're no longer a slave you're free amen have you heard that call have you heard that trumpet sounds hey man one of these days Lord Jesus gonna look over and saying Gabriel step on out blow that shop amen I can't wait for that and there ain't no grave my granddad would stand up here grab his ear and sing a song ain't no grave gonna hold this pie there ain't one in Harrisonburg there in one of Virginia there ain't one in the United States it's gonna hold a member of the bride underneath the ground because when that trumpet sounds we're all coming out of that ground amen [Applause] Amen it's something that's drawing us something that's on the inside of us that's saying go forth keep pressing on many have fallen away don't look at any of that's falling away you keep pressing on you keep your eyes on the prize amen what is it it's it was Christ's passion for you Christ's passion for me the crucifixion a man as brother Branham says it here in the manifestation of the resurrection and he says and I can see that profit that prince of prophets the king of prophets the Lord Jesus Christ as he came out of the gate moving along his space set towards Calvary the burdens of the world laid upon his blessed shoulders the Bible says there is no beauty that we should desire him perhaps a frail little fella as he walked out of that gate his head threw back his eyes towards heaven as he'd marched towards the will of God people make in front of him we only just have a shadow of it today but what was he looking at as he marched toward Calvary at you at me I can just see it now brother branham had that that vision that he could just see it like a TV picture we have The Passion of Christ the movie today and as they've beaten him beyond recognition inside of those gates there and men that were ordained of God to be there to rip flesh from his body and he's carrying that cross as he walks through those gates in his head set towards Calvary that's my king he was thinking of me I had that promise that he had me on his mind Philippians 3 and 13 says brethren I can't lock myself apprehend it but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth to those things which are before as I've said it before I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus that's my promise that's each and every one of our promises in John 14:1 it says let not your heart be troubled that's the promise you've meant it quoted many times at funerals when there's been men umbers laying right here but this is to each and every one of us that has that promise let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would not have told you now he's telling his disciples this says I'm coming back for you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also oh how beautiful that is tonight that we have that promise that where he is we're gonna be there his head set towards Calvary me when his mine you on his mind he knew each and every one of us would be here at the foundation of the world setting right where we are tonight and we're predestinated to live in this age this hour to overcome each and every demon that would come against us and we're gonna stand and we're gonna fight together as a bride believers in this last day and when we get there they're gonna come to the gates and they're gonna go they come through they ought to see those folks on here Christian soldiers marching as to war why don't you go out of that promise tonight amen let's stand that's just thing that song those were my nails why is that she would stretch along [Music] and one for me save his breath [Music] where I was [Music] why [Music] those were my neighbors that was my crowd that kissed your hands your breath those are my balls those were past orders those for my tears that filter and just as said you take it all for me [Music] bastard [Music] [Applause] [Music] bless you tonight for the waves gonna come and speak to us now god bless man if you do the house of the lord god bless each and every one of you appreciate that brother matthew wonderful word of the lord amen while you're standing if you'll just turn with me to numbers chapter six we'll read briefly and let you be seated the help of the Lord like to speak to you for a few moments on your Nazarite vow numbers chapter 6 verse 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel and saying to them when either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite to separate themselves into the Lord he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried all the days of his separation shall he nothing that is made of the tree bond from the kernels even to the husk all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head until the days be fulfilled in the which he separated himself into the Lord he shall be holy and shall let the locks of his hair of his head grow all the days that he separated himself unto the Lord he shall come at no dead body he shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother or for his brother or for his sister when they die because the consecration of his God is upon his head all the days of his separation is holy unto the Lord Amen god bless yous you're seated a Nazarite as we just read is someone that is separated a very special group of people a very select special person that is separated only unto the Lord it does not matter what anyone else in the Old Testament whenever someone had set themselves to be a Nazarite unto the Lord they were to let their hair grow which is why our sisters don't cut their hair a man it is to express of a Nazarite vow within now that was in the natural but now the bride of Jesus Christ our spiritual Nazarites and when there's outward expressions of an inward work now Jesus was a Nazarite from his very birth in John 17 19 he says and for thy are their sakes I sanctify myself that they also may be sanctified through the truth the Prophet teaches us that God's Word calls for a total separation from unbelief not partially not just the part that you like but a total separation from unbelief and that makes you a Nazarite unto the Lord remember the story of the Prophet tales whenever that great musician plays and at the end everyone is clapping and thinks he did such a good job he was only looking up in the balcony to see if his master approved and that's all we're to do we're not to look at one another and get approval by flesh and blood but were to look to God because we are a Nazarite unto the Lord we are we are set aside and called for a purpose now I want to deal with a few moments with Samson because we know that Samson had a supernatural birth his parents his mother was barren and she was visited by an angel from the Lord and said that you were going to have a son because there was during the day of the judges and they were under the burden of the Philistines and they were they were under their thumb and they would come and they take their crops and things and in the book of Judges is where you find that that verse there about Shamgar he was under the thumb of the Philistines so God raised Samson up to destroy the Philistines and he was a Nazarite from his birth a person filled with the Holy Ghost is the Nazarite from your born-again Holy Ghost birth that separates you from the things of the world and that sets you aside for God's service then that makes you a Nazarite unto the Lord now Samson's channel Sampson's secret to his great strength was in his hair he had them seven locks of hair that were never to be touched no matter what happened no matter how much his friends might have made fun of his long hair no matter what he might have thought when he looked in the mirror that was his direct connection to God was his hair that is what made him a Nazarite and as long as as he had them seven locks god almighty was obligated to Samson because that was his promise to Samson and the Spirit of the Lord would come and he would channel him so that was God's covenant to Samson no matter what came across Samson's path no matter what Samson faced he could feel them seven locks that was a promise that he had from God despite the circumstances despite how many Philistines came against him he could reach back there and feel them seven locks no matter what comes against you saints of God no matter what you face in life you can reach back there and you can feel the Holy Ghost you can feel that token that he promised he'd never leave you or forsake you that was his secret to his strength that was his defense and he know he was charged to never give up that secret he was charged with when he was charged he had a charge from God to never divulge that secret to absolutely anyone to no stranger so we find that that our covenant that our seven locks is the type of the Holy Ghost is a type of this word this message that we have and we are not to budge from one single bit we're not to divulge from one single bit we're not to to let the enemy get in because I can promise you something where the weak spot in the word is in a person's life is where Satan gets access in a person's life in a church in a marriage and a family in a nation in a church age where they let down the bar that's where Satan gets in so God was obligated to this covenant as long as the seven locks of his hair remained uncut because whenever that lion rose up he was in the line of duty he was walking he was going down and their lions sprung up and it was no kitten and the Spirit of God came upon him in the Bible said that he tore him like a kid like a good like a baby go he just ripped him apart because he had been seven locks remember bro Ram said he wasn't some big bodybuilder he was a short man he was a small man in stature and he was your average man but yet the anointing of God was strike him and he would have supernatural strength because he was anointed with the Covenant so one day the enemy he was raised up to destroy caught him isolated one day caught him with no defence he was out by himself one day and an army of Philistines came up against him and all he had was a jawbone of a mule a fragile an old crusty jawbone of a mule of a donkey laying there but yet he could feel them locks he could reach back there and fill them Locke soon when he felt them locks he grabbed that in the spirit of God came on him and he killed a thousand Philistines by himself a thousand Philistines what is Psalm 91 say though a thousand or ten thousand rise up against me they won't come near me because you're anointed with the Covenant because you're a Nazarite unto the Lord you've got that seven you've got that seven steel covenant you've got that full word you've got the Holy Ghost and God is obligated to you you know the prophet of God says in the church age book that you give God a reason for being to take care of you the purpose of the husband it gives him a purpose in life to take care of his family brother Brennan said Samson never walked up first and said here I'll tell you apart but the Spirit of the Lord come upon him that's what it did he felt back there and felt them seven locks hanging down that was the Covenant and he wasn't scared of a lion in the face of death he wasn't scared of it if Samson could feel seven lakhs and no it was a covenant because he was born and azurite how much more out a man that's born of the Holy Spirit feel the power of God and know what's the Covenant just slay the enemy before you whether it's sickness whether it's temptation whatever it is you can't stand it when the Spirit of God comes god is obligated to you when enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God will raise up a standard against it now Samson he was a servant of the Lord but you know he surrendered his strength to God but Samson had a weakness he had a weakness of women and Satan knew that and he would not surrender his heart and you see that's exactly where Satan punched him that's exactly where Satan got in so the secret Samson secret was the word that was this secret to his power to his victories when he could when they cornered him in and he went and got the actual gates of the city and went up went up hill with a whole gates of the city on him I guarantee he wasn't struggling he wasn't huffing and puffing he carried it like you'd carry an empty box now in the judges 16 if you make your way over there this evening I would like to type Samson with the individual and Delilah being a type of lady hacia the world and judges 16 15 and she saith unto Him how canst thou say I love thee when that heart is not with me thou hast mocked me these three times and it's not told me where in that great strength lieth and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death that he told her all his heart and said to and said unto her there hath not a razor come upon my head for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb if I be shaven then my strength will go from me and if I become weak and be like any other man and I shall become weak and be like any other man and when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the Lords of the Philistines saying come up this once free it showed me all his heart then the Lords of the Philistines came up unto her and brought money in their hand and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him we have to watch this spirit of lady hacia now because it will gradually come in like Delilah just put Santa's head right on her lap and begin to hum to him his favorite song and begin to play with his hair and begin to put him to sleep in a gradual way and he had no idea he thought that he could rise up and just shake himself and Satan will try and tell you that you can go so far as sin you'll be able to shake yourself but you'll be able to get away with this that you'll be able to get away with that you can stop smoking at any time you can stop looking at the wrong websites at any time you've got this but you don't because that spirit of Lady hacia is they say like boiling a frog can never boil the frog but they say you turn it up ever so gradually and that frog has no idea what's happening and that's what Satan likes to do he likes it too to isolate somebody and just slowly slowly that spirit of ladies here comes and if you don't rise up and shake yourself you're gonna find yourself asleep on Delilah's nice brother Brennan said notice now what Delilah did to Samson when she kept wooing him oh you're a great man oh you're a powerful and that's what Satan will tell you oh you're such a Christian you can never fall you're such a Christian you can go to the bar you're such a Christian you don't have to turn your head because you had this that or the other he will try and woo you brother branham said a Holy Ghost he'll man will turn his head a Holy Ghost filled woman will turn her head a Holy Ghost filled person will the Holy Ghost gods your feet guides your mind your tongue gods your hand and so Delilah was wooing him trying to bring this down to a close oh you're a great man you are powerful but don't deceive me tell me where in you life your strength and she loved them and she made love to him until finally he gave in and what do they do the first thing she did she had his secret taken from him when you leave the word you've left God when Samson gave up his secret to Delilah he left God God was obligated to his covenant for as long as Sampson stayed in but he divulged his secret now let's look at verse 20 and she said the Philistines be upon thee Samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said I will go out as the other times before and shake myself and whit's not that this that the Lord had departed from him but the Philistines took him now watch what happened and put out his eyes he couldn't see no more so when Satan get someone isolated and gets them in a lady of seeing condition because we're surrounded by lady or SIA but we're not in a later scene condition if apéritif you're in a later scene condition you need God because the latest scene condition is lukewarm blind naked miserable and don't know it sir Samson was in a Lagos in condition he had his eyes put out what was Jesus saying come to me and get outside that you can see and we see that brother Ram type Samson with the Pentecostals they were they came out and every single every single group do you do you understand that the Lutheran's were really the message believer of their day though people that came out under John Wesley were message believers but they be denominated whenever the Lutheran's whenever they denominated when God moved with Wesley they refused to move and that killed him right there and so as the ages unfolded the Pentecost was the the was those the light of the day God was restoring the gift he was preparing to sent a prophet when the Prophet came they fused and they denominated remember brother Han said that was a secret thing that was wrong and all the church ages and they got their eyes put out and they became a spectacle for the world now they're powerless they're powerless but let's read judges 16 22 howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven there was hope in Samson's restoration that wasn't the end brother Brennan said but there is a new generation coming on now Samson's hair has grown out so even though the Pentecostals compromise on the word and denominated and got their Hitler locks shaven the Samson's hair is regrowing and that is the bride of Jesus Christ we're in a restored way and when God seen his promise he's seen him since Samson's hair growed again that was God's promise to Samson that's right and when God seen Samson with his promise God was obligated to Samson to put his arms around them big old pillars like that and pulled her right in his strength had come to him again what was his cry just once more Lord and if you're a Samson in this church tonight cry out Lord just once more if he failed if you're sick Lord you've healed me wants just once more just once more Lord because you know whenever Samson finally surrendered his heart he killed more Philistines in that moment than he did his entire life when he finally got so surrendered and so broken he said Lord let me die with the enemy I don't care what it takes if I've got to die with the enemy let me die but just once more hear my prayer I failed you I'm being led by a child I have no eyes they're making fun of me they say my God's not real but just once more this endtime bride I believe with all my heart is getting more done than the other he just put together God's technology as they can stream their services and they can just send a quote through text and they can translate sermons and they can listen to the Prophet online and do all these things and other people of other ages have to walk and walk and walk in him deliver paul's letter and he can just send it send it send it will close with this brother Graham says to come Lord Jesus catch or catch away your church and if it be your will Lord just before that church is raptured may their rise power O God fill these vessels raise them up Lord shake this world once more we know it will be past time there will be no more repentance then it'll be too far for them then but show your power Lord fill those vessels and shake this world like it's never been shipped before take your church then and God promised a powerful shaking right before this little bride is taken off the earth just once more Lord just once more it doesn't matter how much you failed it doesn't matter where you are there's hope in restoration remember Samson killed more of the enemy God raised Samson to kill the Philistines and that and then Philistines were making fun of him and the enemy got victory over God's servant because of his humanity he failed like the rest of them but yet in his restoration he killed more of the enemy because he finally surrendered his heart to God double issue this evening amen appreciate y'all so much [Applause] [Music]

[Applause] [Music] man if you have your Bibles again we'll turn over to the scriptures into the book Isaiah chapter 54 and verse 16 and verse 17 and then down to mark chapter 11 and verse 20 I have already given you my theme this past weekend for the new year that God is with us and we will see miracles this is the year for miracles and we're gonna walk into those things and I just I just know these things are very pertinent to us but this this this the scripture that we read here in Isaiah chapter 53 54 verse 16 and 17 is is our pastors favorite Scripture you can probably hear it in every every sermon that he's ever preached behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the coals and the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and I have created the waste or to destroy no weapon no weapon that is formed against the shall prosper every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment thou shall condemn Church I'm speaking to you thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord mark chapter 11 and verse 20 these things are very very familiar to us as believers of the message that these things were pondered over by the prophet of the Lord were these were these scriptures in the atonement and the atonement that Christ paid for us and they are and we have seen mighty miracles that have taken place by the reading of these scriptures today we are not fighting an enemy with just just a book today we are fighting an enemy with a living word a living God this is the literal word of God on printed pages and you have the ability to take this word and put it upon your lips speak it from your heart and watch the enemy crumble under your feet and the Bible says here in mark 11 and 20 and in the morning as they pass by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remembrance say them to him master behold the fig tree which thou cursed it is withered away and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say under this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them this if this is anybody scripture this is your scripture that what thing soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them god bless his word you may be seated this evening I'll just go ahead and tell you I'm gonna take more than 15 minutes I've got something to deliver to you this evening as a body as a church and the things I have to deliver I know this that God is with us and we will see miracles so blessed be the name of the Lord God is with us and we will see miracles as a church full gospel Lighthouse we have seen some of the most prolific miracles right here in our midst we have seen the dead raised we have seen life spoken to dead wounds we have seen visions come to fulfillment and little bitty blond-headed boys we will see miracles to this coming year we have seen car wrecks that looked like all hope was gone it looked like that there was no way that a man could survive a wreck like this but God made a way Church of the Living God we've seen miracles because that's what we are is the Church of the Living God we have seen sarcoidosis that was staring down the Queen of our church we watched it be destroyed by the power of prayer and whose prayers was it that destroyed that your prayers in a Living God because what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you shall receive them and you shall have them and it was your prayers in a living God that cursed the life of sarcoidosis and sarcoidosis is defeated it is defeated in the name of Jesus Christ it was your prayers that breed over a man by the name of Harold shifflett and Harold shifflett was completely delivered we have seen miracles we seen produções come back to this church when it looked like they would not come back brother Lawrence you came back in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we have seen miracles if anybody is going to see miracles We the People of God are going to see miracles we believe these things my brother Steve Thomas's funeral as you all know maybe I will speak some things that I have not spoke before but because the enemies challenged I will speak these things brother Steve Thomas's funeral I I asked I asked that day for a very special visitation and that the angel the Lord would hold me up while I preached behind this pulpit at that time I was a young book as you would say but I had reached several funerals at that time and before this I had preached maybe maybe 10 15 funerals at that time just kind of being thrown right into the fire but brother Steve Thomas his passing it gripped every single one of our hearts and because I was so close with brother Jeffrey and brother Stephen the family I needed a supernatural God I needed a supernatural God to wrap his arms around me and to hold me up that day especially and I asked for that same supernatural God to visit that family and that's exactly what happened while I stood at this pulpit maybe how long has this been now brother Jeffrey four or five years now I stood at this pulpit and sister Margie shifflett while I stood at this pulpit she watched the pillar of fire hover over this pulpit there were others brother Lloyd and herself watched the pillar fire hover over this pulpit while I preached to you and as that pillar of fire began to hover over hover over brother Steve's casket and over the flowers those flowers that had not yet bloomed those flowers become opened up at the presence of the som Nature has to recognize that God is with us and I'll say this to you tonight in 2020 that same pillar fire is here that same pillar of fire is fighting our battles that same pillar of fire is for us and he will not leave us he will not forsake us but he will take us until the end of the world he will be right here to guide you to comfort you to strengthen you to be your buckler to be your shield he is our God we're not trusted in a weak guard tonight we're trusting in the Almighty God the God of creators heaven and earth the God that hangs the earth or nothing that's the God that we're counting on that's the God sits here that's the God that will win this battle we watched we watched our pastor go through fight after fight battle after battle a pastor fell off a 40-foot ladder as he was chimney sweeping in Christiansburg Virginia fell off that ladder on the concrete right onto his back and broke every single vertebrae in his back doctor said that he'd never walk again called him my my my pawpaw Spencer and my mother called her in said he to walk again that he be confined to a he be confined to a wheelchair the rest of his life but the proof is in the pudding not only did he walk again but he walked out of the hospital that night [Applause] struck by lightning bit by a copperhead brother Homer said here take these two benadryl swallow him while I pray for you laid his hands on him prayed for him and he said now go back to work bit by a copperhead hit by lightning two strokes too many heart attacks and of course the fire doctors told him because of the severity of his burns seventeen percent of his body was burned at 75 percent of his lungs were burned that he'd never preached again but he has a knack for proving the doctors wrong [Applause] at the camp meeting the following year while brother bisca was preaching all of a sudden the angel of the Lord said this is your night stood up behind those pillars there as many of you have set there and those comfortable seats and all of a sudden the Holy Ghost decided to provide an oxygen bottle with the Holy Ghost oxen into his lungs when doctor said that he never preached again and for the past 12 years many demons have been defeated from a body that was told that he never walk again that he'd be confined to a wheelchair that he couldn't live that he shouldn't live if he did make it he won't make it very long and that he'll never preach again but night after night weekend after weekend convention after convention he has proved the devil wrong laburnum said that people try to make faith complicated but God don't make it complicated it's us that make it complicated we're going way out there trying to get something way out there and here it is right here by us it's simple if you've got faith enough to walk across that floor you got faith enough for anything that God promised if you've got faith enough to rise up your hand raise up your hand you've got faith enough for anything else it's simple faith it's not something something weighs super up there are super faith it's simple faith God honors that without and shared something with me yesterday by the first lady the wife of Franklin Roosevelt Eleanor Roosevelt said you gain strength courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stopped to look fear in the face you are able to say to yourself I live through this horror I can take the next thing that comes along you gain strength courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stopped to look fear in the face you are able to say to yourself I live through this horror I can take the next thing that comes along church we are believers and believing is what we do we have been through many battles together we're going to go through many battles more together so I'm going to ask you like a never-before to call on the Almighty God like never before I'm going to ask you to believe like never before I'm going to ask you to release your faith like never before and I'm going to ask you something that may standard you if there's anything in your life that would hold your prayer back from reaching God I want you to get it right the only thing that stands between you and God is unconfessed sin and if there's anything that's going to stand between you and your prayers to God I want you to confess those things to God get those things right and make it right and have a conversation with God and get into full contact with Almighty God brother Branham said that prayer is the greatest weapon that is given to mankind when you're praying you're not speaking to something weak God you're talking to a God that can change the course of humanity you're talking to a God that can set the world on in by the power of one word give those things right in your life and watch the prayer go to work as a guy who prayed one time and when the Prophet came in and give him a death warrant he prayed turned his face to the wall and weapon ask God for 15 more years he prayed and God turned back the clock of time and he gave him 15 more years Hezekiah knew how to pray Hezekiah prayed one time and there was no arraign for three and a half years Hezekiah prayed and hailstones came down and rained upon the Assyrian and killed a hundred and eighty-five thousand Syrians before that camp of Israel could get out of their bed prayer works I'm asking you as a church to believe in a Living God to do extreme things to believe that Bible days are here again to believe that the god of this bob was right here with us that the God that raised the dead that God that brought dead life to dead wounds that God that are healed cancer that God that did all of these events will do it again this is the part I want your attention I want you to hold your children still I don't want you to listen to me like you never listened to me before brother Ron had been having a few issues in his body and so they the day before Christmas Eve well Ron went to the doctor and the doctors looked over his body and they ordered a an emergency CT scan they ordered another CT scan this this past week on Wednesday and we got the doctor results yesterday and the CT scan show the brother on has nodules in his lungs and that there is a lymph node under brother Ron's left arm that has inflamed or enlarged the doctors at this point do not know what they are we don't know what they are but we're not crossing bridges until they get to us so brother on will be seeing doctors this coming week to set a course of action in place I'm asking you to believe like never before we are serving a god that is the dissolver of doubts do you remember when the Queen the Queen came to Belshazzar and she said there I hear that there is a man in your in your kingdom that has the ability to tell the secrets in the King's chambers and that he is it at his offer of doubts and I want to tell you as a church that God is the God that's going to dissolve these tumors in brother ons lungs [Applause] scans have been wrong before and doctors seemed to blame it on faulty equipment and I'm not blaming showing no blame to no doctor here but I'm just telling you what God is able to do yeah we've got the doctor's report but who hath believed our report Isaiah 53 says to whom is the arm of the Lord we have believed God's report when he was in a fire we have believed God's report when they fell off of a 40-foot ladder we have been commissioned to pray we have been commissioned to believe we have been commissioned to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover brother Branham said never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts don't entertain it never let a negative thought pass through don't let it stop anyhow if it starts keep your thoughts positive Jesus don't let don't think sitting there in a wheelchair that you're hopeless or helpless you're not don't let that negative thought ever pass through don't let it ain't curved you can't help it from going through your mind that's right but don't let it stop don't think that kind of a negative thought I'm just giving you several quotes here don't think that kind of a negative thought don't let it go through your mind make every word positive and every thought positive for gospel lighthouse make every word positive and every thought positive whether Barnum said while I'm praying and speaking I want every person in here to have this in your mind that as soon as prayer begins to go for the sick every one of you is going to get up and walk out of the building well don't have nothing else in your mind keep thinking that if there be any praise if they're being averts you think on these things you cannot get anything from God with a negative fault he there cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him so I'm commissioning you right now if you have a negative thought rethink it if you want to talk negative please call 1-800 I need help and tell them if you have a negative thought if you got a negative comment don't speak it if you got a negative comment don't speak it do not speak it do not speak it are you following me if you've got a negative comment whatsoever do not speak it to brother on do not speak it his sister Connie do not speak it to me [Applause] now we're not a bunch of robots here we understand the human element we understand the emotion inside what's going through what's going through your mind but I want you to know we are not gonna let narrow negative thoughts stay in our mind we're not going to give the devil credit brother branham told us that the devil's a password he told us that that he has no legal right he has no legal authority let no negative thoughts stay in your mind let no negative comment come forth from your mouth unless you want to rebuke for me because I will give it to you I'm not pretending that this is some fairy tale but I want everything that we do to be positive I want it to be thus saith the Lord if you got something to say give him a scripture you got something to say give him a quote we don't want your pity brother Ron don't want your pity he don't want your sorrow he wants your prayers we are believers and we do not fear Satan's powers because they have been stripped from him and we are disputing with a conquered enemy Church we're gonna do like a four-year-old little girl told us to do last week she walked around and I didn't know what she was doing but she was ahead of me she walked around saying I refute the devil I refute the devil I refute the devil I refute the devil I refute the death I refute the death I refute the death I refute the death I refute the death under now the devil we are here to prove the devil wrong Full Gospel lighthouse we refute the devil in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I want at this time us as a church to come and to to unify our faith and pray for brother on his brother Ron and the brothers would come and make their way to the podium and everybody else would surround them while you're making your way out I want you to listen to the words that I'm speaking make your way this way quickly calmly collectively and listen to these words brother Branham said I want you to repeat this prayer so as you're making your way this way I want you to repeat this prayer he says you pray it I'll repeat it you pray it I'll just transfer the words that it takes to defeat Satan right to your lips for the wrong your general in the kingdom of God and he is not just attacked you he has attacked the bride of Jesus Christ but more than this this is attack on God's kingdom you're not alone we're standing right here with you we've been born for moments like yes I'll

Pruitt's words many times we are believers and believing is what we do the fervent prayer the righteous man availeth much when you pray I don't want you to pray from a defeated heart I want you to pray with victory in your soul God is with us and we will see miracles 2020 is the year of miracles and it starts right here Heavenly Father I come before you the author and the finisher of our faith there is none like You there is none beside you there's none before you Father you are God the Bible says that you hang the earth on nothing surely you can take men and may think themselves good for nothing and make something out of them we have seen your witnessing power of the Holy Ghost come time and time again and we have seen you come and do mighty miracles amongst us father this is a foul spirit of Hell that has tried to torment your sermon but Iran is not just my dad brother wrong is a servant of the Most High God and he has done the kingdom of hell much damaged and we stand here as a body of believers laying hand upon the sick you commissioned us by the power of Jesus Christ to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover Lord Jesus these are not man's words these are your words now father we believe these words and father we're putting them into action Lord I pray father as we pray the prayer of faith father may the healing virtues of Jesus Christ that flowed down from Calvary begin to flow over brother ons vessel just now tumors you have to leave in the name of Jesus Christ fear you have to leave in the name of Jesus Christ you are a defeated foe you have been stripped of all of your power you had can hold you cannot hold yours promise you cannot hold it bound you can try to lock us up in fear but we rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ we deny and we are here to prove you wrong father this is a year of miracles and I pray that the healing virtues of Christ would go to work just now we as a body unite ourselves together and you said where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst of healing Lord Jesus I call upon the God of heaven made a mighty angel just now stretch forth his wings may healing rise up in his soul just now may the same angel of God that hovered over this pulpit five years ago and proclaim that you are a God that was with Steve Thomas may that same pillar fire hover over this pulpit just now Lord I pray God that you are the one that stood there night after night time after time and you revealed the secrets of the heart I pray father Lord Jesus that you go to work and I pray that you dissolve these nozzles in the name of Jesus Christ father I pray that those demons that try to interrupt God's plans would be defeated in the name of Jesus Christ father this is your servant and we ask you these things in the name of Jesus we believe these things in the name of Jesus and we're going to see these things in the name of Jesus [Music] holy billy god bless you as you head back to your seats achievement we believe that all things are possible [Applause] [Music] Oh liebelei only Oh things [Music] Oh such as Oh change things are [Music] Oh [Music] oh gee [Music] you can be seated I pray that you would allow me just a few more moments to slap the devil around 12 years ago this September would be 13 years ago I was not in the position that I am now I was not I was not I did not recognize who I was at that time but shortly after that I did but many criticized or did not understand may I say that word maybe not criticize but didn't understand why we as a family we didn't give we didn't give voice to the enemy they didn't understand we were sending out reports that brother on had a good night because I live every single day as if this day I've got another chance to live mother on had another chance to live while he was there on that ventilator and brother on had another good day they didn't understand what we were coming from because before dad went through the fire dad had taught us as Christians that we believe no matter what we see with our natural eyes we believe man they didn't understand that they didn't understand the circumstances that we were facing so they had to come and see for themselves and brother Ron was in he was in a precious state of life we didn't I didn't understand who I was I did not come to my awakening as a son of God but this is a different battle I know exactly who I am I know exactly what I've been called for and if I could believe from that point and from that perspective as a human being what about now church we are further up the road thirteen years now than what we were 13 years ago we have seen miracle upon top of miracle this will be another testimony it's at the darkest hours that Jesus steps in this is not Gabriel that's coming this is not Warren Lord is coming this is God that's coming and Jesus has taken the case Jesus has taken the case you see Satan has limited power what he can do you see he can't get to that soul round he cannot get to that soul realm and you see he's got limited power and got limited access in you that working high positions you have you have passwords and you have codes to get into that position and there are certain people that below you that have they don't have access there that is a restricted area that they cannot go to and you see Satan has access to the flesh because that's where he is he is allowed to go but he cannot go to that soul realm but you see God has unlimited power God has the ability to catch Satan all the way out all the way from the soul from the spirit into the flesh he can kick the devil completely out God has unlimited power I want you to know tonight that we are defeated we are disputing with a defeated enemy and nothing has hindered God at one moment it is not hindered his plan not one thing not one iota is out of place the fall didn't hinder God lot didn't hinder God the idol God fell did not hinder God Judas and his plans did not hinder God skeptics did not hinder God sickness did not hinder God cancer has not hindered God sugar diabetes has not has not hindered god TB did not hinder God sin a hinder God unbelief ain't hinder God it may hinder you but it will not defeat God we as a family we are a family and Satan is messed with the wrong family we are the family of the Most High God the possessor of heaven and earth the miracle worker that's a part of family I am in the miracle worker the promise keeper the waymaker the champion of champions we're his family never has he went into battle one time that he didn't come out pack in the victory he's marvelous in battle he's got zero losses he can't lose that's my god and it's his family that the devil was messing with cancer can't stop him sister Karen Pruett brain bleeds couldn't stop him undeveloped the hips couldn't stop him barren wombs couldn't stop him miscarriages couldn't stop him lungs that were destroyed couldn't stop him heart attacks couldn't stop him broken vertebrates couldn't stop him fires can't stop God bad accidents can't stop God crawl sides can't stop God blind eyes can't stop God fear can't stop God there is power in the name of Jesus Christ to break every chain and it's going to take a stronger win than this to keep me from my promise Wow sites and you are defeated oh we're gonna win this battle we're not gonna win it by emotions we're not going my win it by working you up we're gonna win this battle by just exactly how Jesus won this battle by the word it is written it is written Isaiah 53 by his stripes I am healed the Bible said in Philippians 4 and 13 that I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me Paul understood his weakness and he understood the humanity part and he said in 2nd Corinthians 12 and 10 therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then am i strong and Paul being conscious of this human element Paul directed us to Ephesians 6 and 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might I want you to take these scriptures personally put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all stand Paul recognized that he was not all-powerful Paul recognized that he was Amon was not omniscient he recognized that he was not omnipotent but he recognized that the god that he was serving was and that he could do all things through Christ who strengthens heal God ain't changing he ain't moving he ain't backing up on his promise he is the all-powerful God is with us and we will see miracles I have preached to you the last 10 years and I have been a student I've been a student of this message I have stayed when everybody else was playing basketball when everybody else was out with their family enjoying dinners I stayed in this word I stayed in this message I've listened to messages after messages after messages I may not listen to every single one of the 1,100 to 1,200 sermons that there are but I can say that I've listened to some of them thousands of times I have been a student of this message for moments like this you have watched me battle time and time again from this pulpit there's a whole line of fighters in my family history I can point back to Abraham when he took 318 servants and he come back packing into victory I can point back to Elijah when he was dancing on the altar I can point back to King David I can point back to Homer Frazier I can point back to Charlie Spencer and Iran Spencer Fighting's in my blood Fighting's in my family history Fighting's in your history this is the heritage of the Lord but I want to assure you you ain't never seen me fight like I'm getting ready to fight I'm getting ready to roll the sleeves up and I'm going to preach to you faith like never before and I'm asking you to do the same thing I'm asking you to meditate in this word I'm asking you to confess what God has said you see you can mess with me and you can might get by with it but you mess with my children it's a different story you can mess with me better off and maybe get by better off than you talk about my parents you see Satan has not just come against me but he's come against my dad he's come against my friend he's come against he's come against my pastor he's come against your pastor he's come against your friend he's come against your confident and I want you to take this personal and I want you to fight like never before I want you to pray like never before I want you to believe like never before meditate upon these things that you shall have good sir good success be of good courage the LORD thy God is with thee that's with us and we will see miracles Satan I want to declare to you we will not back down we will not back up we will not give in and we will not give up or is open on hail Satan your kingdom so I asked you like Moses asked the children of Israel who's on the Lord's side Full Gospel answers on the Lord's side he never lost the battle he's worn every single battle you're fighting with the Lord that captain of Hosts and he's on my side and I'm on his side before I before I turn this over to brother on so he can slap the devil around yeah I want to read to you something written by our pastor on December the 22nd I have been sick before and I made it this was before we knew anything I've been sick before and I made it I've been broke before and I made it I've been brokenhearted before but I made it I cried all night but I'm me I've been betrayed but I made it I've been lied on but I made it I've been destitute but I made it I've been rejected but I made it and he gets sent out a battle cry charge for gospel lighthouse now is not the time to back up go forward [Music] oh it's already time oh it's already turn [Music] it's our turn i'm already [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] unless you can be seated for a few moments I won't hold you but a few minutes but you're quite an awesome group and an awesome family obviously in the kingdom of God God is counted as worthy to stand some test anything that can't be tested it's not worth standing I'd like to thank Andrew for the incredible job that he did to share some things with you that were difficult that are many of them are new I thought brother Matthew did a phenomenal I think that's the best Matthew's dead ever a man each and every one of you William that was absolutely wonderful I'll not take long but I'd like to read your scripture for Samuel chapter 17 verse 41 we've got some precious friends they're tuning in for for this this evening and so I just want to share a few things with them and and we've gotten a lot of eyes that's watching and we'll be watching and the Philistine came one and drew near unto David and the man that bared the shield went before him and when the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him for he was but a youth ruddy and of a fair countenance and the Philistine said unto David am i a dog that thou camest to me with staves and the Philistine cursed David by his gods and the Philistine said to David come to me and I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the air and of the beasts of the field and then said David to the Philistine now came has done to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield when I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of armies of Israel whom Dallas defiled this day will I deliver thee into mine hand and I will smite thee and take on head from thee and I will give thee the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day under the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth and all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel and all his Assembly shall know that the Lord saith not with sword and a spear for the battle is the Lord's and He will give you into our hands I've been sick before but I made it I've been broke before but I made it I've been brokenhearted before but I made it I cried all night long but I made it I've been lied on but I made it I've been destitute but I made it I've been rejected but I made it I've got around me some incredible friends you're known by the friends that you have so I'd like to mention a few generals while I'm in the field since Goliath has made a challenge I'd like to remind him I'm not alone you see when he steps out and he's making his boast and it's sometimes a pretty formidable boast there's a reason why God allowed him to be measured and to be his size because he's no paper tiger but I'd like to remind him since he's made his boast I'm not alone when I was laying in the hospital and they were I just came back to to life and the doctor came in one day and he sit down beside him and he pulled a little chair up and he sit down the side of me he said you know he said I'll work on patience all the time he said they're just patients and I care for them and take care of them he said but we know people by who comes and visits and he says you're a great man not because I think that way because God thinks that way and I'd like to remind him he's picked on somebody and I'm not your average bear and so he monied z-- to know who he's picking on I'd like to thank the doctors that have been working on me so far I'd like to personally thank sister Dolores from this pulpit she is a warrior the news that I got was not pleasant it was quite difficult I'm a human being for the gathering of the news the other yesterday evening brother Nathaniel and sister Suzanne Cain and my family all gathered I knew something was happening when everybody was gathering yesterday evening and I knew I was about to get some difficult news did I weep yes I wept was I disappointed yes I was disappointed did it take my breath yes it took my breath but you just let me catch my breath for a moment you see the Lord has given me special insight and a lot of things in life and one of the first Inklings that I knew that I had a storm coming that one of my buddies brother Kelly Hildebrandt had a very difficult time coming to deliver a message and it may not have sent a signal to you but it sent a signal to me that there's a storm coming three days he was in airports trying to get here three days he he struggled and he prayed and his brother showed up on another aircraft with no trouble whatsoever not even a minute late but the man with the message fought with great agony to get here but he had a message I had prayed that week and and God had spoke to me a message and that message was don't worry and I preached that message with all my heart delivered it to you as an audience and I've got just incredible response from it from different places people being healed and I spoke to you on don't worry then God began to drop sermons in my heart that one would be courage I knew that I was to go to brother bisko's and brother Tom raised to speak and as brother Kelly comes and delivers his heart then brother Danny Steinmann comes and as he preaches and I'm sitting there and he's delivering the Word of God these men are generals I consider men like Kim pricked Donny Reagan Kelly Hildebrandt now I'm naming the generals in the field Joe green I consider these men Jason Jackson that's named after the warrior that came from this valley and I don't want to offend nobody but the multitude of men that I stand with I got to fellowship with by the mystical and brother Tom ray the other day and I thought of how what a blessing that God has allowed me to do when I went to dr. Buckwalter the other day and and I just we just had a very frank conversation and he's a real man he's a real Christian an examination went the way that it did he expedited the process and I'd like to thank you for all the emergency signals and things that have led us to this point we've got the news that we have but what would we do with the news I'd like to just remind and just recycle just for a moment he gave his sermons don't worry he gave us sermons to take it back he gave us a sermon to go wash naman and we are overcomers as I shared with you as Christmas would come and and you see I'm uh I'm uh I'm a little bit of a different sort of person there's certain things that I kind of take real sensitive to myself hey I I attach myself to certain things and and there's a man that's named Abraham a hunter that would paint a picture that would hang over my over my ax in the big room that brother Terry built and it's called Shalom which is peace the line with the lamb dedicated my home to that that's what my home is I I said this last week we have a table that seats I think 18 people 16 on the normal basis it can stretch to 18 and above and we had a Christmas party the other day and we'd stretch later as far I think we had about 40 there of her family that was there enjoy that I put on a bow tie and an apron and enjoyed the whole day but we've never had an argument there nobody's ever got up from the table and LAN out of the room because there was feuds and anybody can stand at that cent that tonight and say it's wrong but nobody's ever left my table man and upset Satan's not welcome in her house and I want to remind him these lungs were given to me twelve years ago by the creation of the Word of God so Satan has moved in into God's creation and I want to stand and you say well brother on should you have a pity party I want no pity [Applause] if this is the battle that I must fight then let us fight when I looked at the picture of Jesus coming through the storm and it has dropped into my hands I'm an individual that I went after that picture and I couldn't get it and I don't lose very often I'll stay after it some of you that's been in auctions you realize I when I go after a piece I go after a piece some of you've been in war know that it when I'm after I'm after it when I go to pray I believe in a God that here's an answers prayer but that does not make us immune because we live in a net and atom body and this atom body is cursed with a curse but listen new brother branham makes a statement he said death will come to your door and you can walk into it prematurely or and I choose the order tonight my God's bigger than this problem he's bigger than whatever they label it I will attend every appointment that the doctors have for me to attend some of the tests has already been a little bit rigorous for my body and God's given me deliverance even tonight to be able to stand here with you I have an appointment Monday morning with dr. buck Walker again and the team have an appointment with the specialist on Friday at UVA in the pulmonary clinic some of you that have tried to get Seth you've been trying to get appointments for a long time you could testify that it's a miracle that I get an appointment this quickly with the specialist in there'll be scans coming and a lot of different things that will happen but regardless of what you hear and regardless of what Galatz name is I want you to be with me now regardless of what the name of Goliath is we're going to win [Applause] I shared this last week with you or two weeks with you and then I shared it with brother Bissell's group be still and know that I am God I'm bigger than your problem I'm bigger than your circumstance I'm bigger than your situation this is not your battle you don't have to handle this this is God's battle God will work it out all you have to do is be still and know that I am God [Applause] pieces have been set around me and I'd like to thank God for the team that is sitting around us tonight the team of musicians that come to their place and play skillfully and they play with an atmosphere of a Holy Ghost atmosphere to prepare us to go to worship thank you for a group of people that comes in attentively and you're you're here and unless unseen foreseeing circumstances you come and you come ready almost every service is like a camp-meeting service here almost convention like atmosphere as preachers we know that's because you're a trained group you're ready you're ready for the Word of God and it's more than about coming for emotion though we love emotion we love we we love emotion we love to worship the Lord we love to feel his power come down but it's the Word of God that will defeat the devil anywhere any place any time under any convicted so brother animus says this he says if you're a Christian believer you're a son of God a daughter of God what are you scared about there's no need of being scared as long as the devil can keep you scared that's all he wants to do if he's if he does he's got you then spiritual amnesia it's not knowing who you are but know you and who you are produces faith Jesus had perfect faith because he knew who he was in the word perfect love cast out all fear and love and faith is the same thing you see love perfect love cast out all fear which gives faith so Goliath wants to march into our field we can already see that we've heard the sermon don't worry and I went with already one report telling me that I had a problem but I still went to Cloverdale and preached courage are you with me knowing that I had one tumor in my left lung that's all I knew at that tongue but I still stood there in the face of Goliath because the fella that I was preaching for had interviewed brother Charlie Mitchell at WWE DJ WDBJ say that 16 times fast that's pretty difficult and they had been having interviews for politicians because it was election season and it would take them hours to do a little second even a commercial and brother Charlie Mitchell and brother Ed Mystikal sat down and they interviewed them for 30 minutes and never had to take a break never had to stop them and the producer said what's the difference brother Bissell said we're telling the truth and I step to that pulpit in in Cloverdale and spoke courage and spoke it with all my heart and then on Sunday morning I walked back to that pulpit and that was the day that Cloverdale would get a bath I preached on name it and people live in double lives and I would say hundreds walk to that altar and while I preached I watched the pillar of fire go up and down over top of joel ray or he with me now and then that night i would preach take it back and god gave me more energy and more strength under the circumstances he's my god today [Applause] you see just as much as there was a picture that was given to me brother Tom Hill probably 99% of this congregation didn't know so brother Tom Hill walks in the back the back door I gotta take my coat off - really is this well and I'm done to be honest with you and he hands me a sling of all the Knights in the world for him to hand me a sling so I could have it God's telling me do you see what God's telling me now I've got confidence now let me just say God ain't done all this for a enemy he ain't done all this for a enemy so prepare you might as well prepare be honest about this face the facts he's a big intimate but we got a big eye and brother John God's taught telling me I got this I got this and brother Tim Pruett when he came here in September gave me five stones so on they disappear from your presence a little bit while I'm walking through the valley to pick up some rocks but when you see me again I'm gonna be swinging in there Oh [Applause] Shannon when he takes now that grave I walk to I don't know what it was like but I'm married millions of angels as that stone rolled away and he set up our Hollywood cake do it justice but when he set up I'll shop [Applause] mother tom you brought an appropriate gift for the time if you look in your life all your life and the devil's Ward in your mind I want you to tell the devil tonight stupid ever God used me to get him ready for the bad so sister Dolores we've had some difficult moments already and we probably got some difficult moments in our future you know that you're honest you know that Google make it [Applause] I walked a girl with cerebral palsy to the altar the other night walked her up and set up on the platform her name is Ella and the circumstances look incredibly difficult but she walked up there and she stood and I believe with all my heart she'll walk perfectly [Applause] don't you love the Lord won't you just turn to your neighbor and say I
