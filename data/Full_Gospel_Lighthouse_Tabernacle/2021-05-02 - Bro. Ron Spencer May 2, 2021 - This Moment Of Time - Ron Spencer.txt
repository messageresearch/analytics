good morning to you what an awesome service last night amen wow i just tell you what i think we're just so close to going home amen amen i i don't know about you but i had a hard time going to sleep after that and that just done my heart some just real good amen just good to be in the house of the lord i woke up this morning had a wonderful morning and it was when i walked into my office this morning it was as though he had been waiting on me to come and sister connie came in after maybe an hour and a half maybe something like that and just tears running down my cheeks she said what's wrong i said it's all right it's not wrong and amen and so we just are so thankful for that amen we're just you know i want to be where he's at you know you can go somewhere where he has been spent a lot of time there but that's where he's been and we can project where he's going to be at but i really want to be where he is in the i am and so we're so thankful for that i i don't know if we can actually put that into words i'd like to try to do that a little bit today amen because i feel like we're living in some very special times i for some of us was able to go to brother sean martin's tent meeting and it was kind of an uh an unexpected type of a thing but i uh kind of the way it all turned out it was a the place where they have chosen to put the tent at and have his meeting at they invited me to be the speaker a few years ago when it first started i'll never forget what the lord spoke to me to speak at that first service this is the lord's doing and i want to i want to i want to use that as a text this morning this is the lord's doing as i sat with my dad at the tent uh friday evening he just kind of looked over at me and he said do you know this very ground as a little boy i was putting tomatoes in this very place right here we put tomatoes in and i could see it in dad's eyes he was just kind of he was just kind of going back as a little boy and now here's the tent setting and on friday evening i think it was about 600 people there and so and just had glorious services and so we're just so thankful for that and what god is doing i i just want to share something with you with god's preparing it's kind of like the ground that we're standing on brother homer had a vision of this place and how it would be and we he brought many of us up on the hill here before we started cutting you cut the trees down and then the land was cut off to where the building could be set and a vision was there god had showed him he was going to have a place here and what a front yard that we've got and and so i think about this place this is not a place that a man chose amen are you with me this is a place that god chose i i like to be where god's act you can build a lot of buildings but i want to be where he's at and so i thought i i gave it some great thought yesterday as i it just kept coming to me and this is just to be part of the service here if you can make it that way and i remember i remember my father my my grandmother was quite a spiritual woman and she saw visions and and my grandfather they had 13 children and he had bought that piece of property for 100 an acre 110 acres and so he decided to sell it because he was a mover and he decided to sell it and she began to pray even on the auction day because they needed that land to have food and and they needed that land to raise those 13 children and you know he would just had a whim he's going to sell it and she began to pray and an angel came in the room with her while she was praying and she just sprawled herself out across that bed and she is praying and the auction literally stalled and the auctioneer couldn't get a person to bid on the littlest item not a person and that place is just full of people and not a person would bid i'll tell you because there was a woman in the room with an angel of the lord and he was preserving that property for that meeting amen hallelujah you see god knows what he's doing he knows what he's going to do on this hill amen and so we're just so thoughtful we're so thankful for that i thought if brother homer could look over the balcony last night i'm sure he would be really pleased my grandmother would would be one of the my dad would come to know the message in about 1960 61 he would come to know the message and and he was fervent and he went home and introduced the message to our family to that's family to his family his mother had had a vision of brother branham never seen him in her life that he would be elijah the prophet and when he handed her a book there was brother branham's picture on the book and she said that's the man that's elijah so i'm going to believe what he's got to say i think it's neat how god does business and so amen and so amen i'm carrying that book with me i'll be carrying it with me the rest of my life because remember here a few weeks ago in the dream brother branham i i saw him and he was in a in a whitish suit and he was and he had spoke we were at the meeting and i was sitting i was sitting about right there and when he got done speaking he walked over to me and he handed me the book the way of a true prophet and he just patted me on the cheek and he said ron you're going to be well amen so i'm carrying it with me and so i want to share a couple things with you before i go but go to speak this morning we want to remind you of brother joe green's meeting he's going to have it this year um it's going to be the first tuesday of august uh i i'm just going to i'm just going to kind of throw this out because they haven't really came to a thing but it looks like it's going to be in his church and so um because of the the place there that where they have been having the meeting has so many rules until they just it's just almost impossible to have a meeting there and so brother joe green is going to have a meeting the first it will start the first tuesday of august and i don't know exactly that date i i right now but first tuesday of august and somebody that's very familiar to you will be one of the speakers and brother donny reagan will be the other speaker and um and so i'll be the speaker as well with brother donnie reagan we feel to have our labor day meetings this year [Applause] amen so this is our first announcement for it brother timothy pruitt will be one of the speakers brother tim pruitt will be another speaker and brother donnie reagan so that's quite a let's quit amen we're certainly looking forward to that i just feel a sense of urgency as we're just nearing the end time and it's all coming to a very close end i you know i i i just feel that way and i and you know i know our buildings sometimes don't hold everybody but i remember as a little boy standing outside of buildings and when we'd have meetings and they were much smaller than this and dad and mom would have us standing outside and we'd listen just we'd stand attentively standing outside listening to the service and clapping and having church standing outside and listening to the preachers because we couldn't get in and you know i i never heard nobody complain it wasn't inconvenient just a hunger in our heart for god and so amen so we're i'm not expecting you know i don't know what to expect in this cove generation and and all i can say is if you're sick stay home so you know that's the best i know how to do i i just don't know but the rapture is not going to wait on covet [Applause] amen amen i'd like to sing a course and let's stand it as well with my soul andrew would you help us with that amen maybe listening the first verse when peace like a river amen [Music] is road my is let's sing it with all of our hearts [Music] my soul [Music] my one more time o with my soul [Music] god bless you i bless you if you will turn with me to psalms 118. amen am i'm so glad to have gabriel here this today and amen he's worked 12 hours last night he's going to work 12 hours this afternoon he came to my house at seven o'clock this morning and 7 30 we had breakfast together and i told him go to bed and so amen so i told him to set his clock for 11 get here for the preaching and then go to work and so you know you know he is one of the products of he came to the lord the day before the brains are turning so amen so i thought how i thought how wonderful timing is and so god bless you gabriel and we pray that you can get some rest tonight amen even in a uniform amen i don't think the governor will get this so i'm going to be all right i'd like for him to get it amen i'd like to speak to you on this moment of time and in psalms 118 and verse 22 the stone which the builders refused is become the head of the corner and if the jewish world could have only recognized that scripture they'd have never crucified jesus christ amen this is the lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the lord hath made and we will rejoice and be glad in it maybe you have a need this morning you just say lord would you remember me as you pass by this way lord jesus we love you with all of our hearts today and we're so thankful for your goodness and mercy upon our lives we ask you just now as we're very aware of your presence that you would come and speak to our hearts and bless this audience now the audience that's watching all over the world we ask you that you'd minister to them and their very pivotal need in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen you can be seated i think about moments of time and sometimes we sometimes things happen in a very supernatural way it's kind of like sitting in a service like what we're listening to last night and or maybe in your past that you've listened to and a person sitting beside you you seem to see be bored and yet you feel like you're almost in rapture i'll say that again it's kind of like sitting in a service like you said last night or maybe in your past and there you're studying and maybe somebody sit beside of you seems to be bored and you feel like you're in rapture sounded better yeah now that's kind of what happens in the history of time prophecy becomes fulfilled and brother brandon would speak a sermon called modern events made clear by prophecy because we can't recognize what's going on until we look at the prophetic word and see we are living in the vision of the word of god and realize by the prophecy that we're here yeah now it's easy when you're standing as as brother branham was standing with a 42 inch caribou and he told about it for years of how it was going to be in the silver tip grizzly bear but you didn't realize you was on the hunt until the animal was on the ground and you're measuring it yeah and you realize you're standing in a green checkered shirt yeah you're in the vision the disciples jesus would say now go get me a cult the fall of an ass now you know that nobody's ever been able to ride an animal like that because it's never it's never had a human being on it and it's just absolutely supernatural it's a supernatural event especially amongst the amish they consider it one of the greatest events in history that jesus was able to get on a cult the fall of an ass because no one no man can get on that because of its wild nature yeah and and jesus and jesus said go get a cult and he says the man will will give it to you amen because he knows the prophecy is going to be fulfilled and the man will give it to you and they come and they bring him and they they begin to write off and and people get under an anointing an anointing begins to take place and people begin to worship him hosanna to the king and they began to pull down branches and and began to scream out why why the pharisees and sanchez should have rejoiced with them but they wanted the people to quiet down yeah there was one group of people recognizing he's the king and he's coming there was another one that was turning them down and it's only seven days a week and he'll be crucified literally go to the judgment hall crucified and then resurrect it don't take god a long time so we realize that we must be aware of our moment of time jesus as i was just just sharing with you in that that exhortation jesus was standing at the judgment hall and pilate asked him whence art thou but jesus gave him no answer sometimes it's more powerful to just stand still than it is to give the devil to our sermon amen because jesus could have given him every secret in the world but he just held himself and then the pilot said unto him speakest thou not of them to me knowest not that i have power to crucify thee in power to release thee and jesus answered thou couldest have no power at all against me except it was given thee from above amen one king speaking to another amen it was a moment of time now from that event i want you to notice what the subscription the super subscription that they wrote over him in luke 23 and verse 33 38 and a super scription also was written over him in letters of greek and latin and hebrew this is the king of jews and one of the mouth factors which were hanging railed at him saying if thou be the christ save thyself and us but the ant but the other answered rebuked him saying dost thou not fear god seeth thou art in the same condition amen and we indeed justly for we received the due reward of our deeds but this man have done nothing amiss are you with me now and he said it to give jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom never heard a sermon never saw a miracle but he's in a moment that's all it takes a moment an eternal moment when time becomes eternal in your moment maybe sitting in a pew maybe dragging your car maybe getting out of bed and the sweep of the holy ghost comes right into your life and you recognize this is more than a man [Applause] amen hallelujah now notice these next words because they're incredible and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in paradise [Applause] jesus says some powerful words in luke chapter 17 and i'm sorry to just come from one scripture to another but we'll preach in just a few moments in luke 17 and verse 29 he says in the same day now notice those words in the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all god sent a messenger of warning to that that that huge city he sent up because god doesn't do anything until he first sends a warning and he sends a warning to lot to leave are you with me now and in the same day lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed living in that day and in that day he shall he he which shall be upon the house top and his stuff in his house let him not come down to take it away and and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back and he says this incredible incredible scripture now remember lot's wife [Applause] whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall save shall lose his life shall preserve him and i tell you that the night that there shall be two men in the bed one shall be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding together and one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field one shall be taken and the other left and they answered and said unto him where lord we want to be in the rapture where is he going to be at we want to be gathered and he said unto them whether so ever the body is through the eagles be gathered together i want to ask you who gathered us here amen we've talked about this place but who gathered us here not just here but around the world are you with me in india where all of that that that is happening there's there's large churches there who gathered them who gathered them and all the nations of the earth who gathered them i'll tell you god gathered him [Applause] you're living in the day when israel was restored as a nation i want you to know god scattered them the scripture prophecy that he would stagger them in all the earth they went to russia they went all over they went to australia they came to america they went to canada listen and they just went all over because god dispersed those jews all all over the earth and they were successful because god gave them a promise they were successful wherever they went but if you'll remember when they were standing on the ground and jesus was in the air they said let his blood be on us they didn't know what they were asking they did not know what they were asking no way could they have fathom in their mind almost over 6 million of them would be gathered and put in torture chambers and destroyed amen the words that brother branham would use that it was the tender hand of jehovah but we find in the seals that they were given white robes yes are you with me they didn't know what they did and jesus forgave them america are you with me god god's got it all in this planet that's a amen thing brother ron let me just say this to you eternal life is more important than this temporary life however we leave it it's if i want eternal life more than anything those jews begin to gather back to a nation that was not a nation and god began to gather them back because it was the season of gathering and they left their businesses they left their homes they left their places and to come back to that land amen listen no doubt they were farmers in another place but when they came back to the land the percentages of their week was 30 percent better because they were in the land their cows gave better milk because they were in the land listen i'm not just giving you some hokey poke story god brought those jews back to the land and he promised it and i want to say this to you god's watching over them [Applause] he's watching over them and nation after nation has tried to destroy them over and over again but i have news for you if god fights your back there's not a nation on the earth can destroy that group are you with them because of the messiah that came to them 2 000 years ago is going to return again and listen we're going to be with him [Applause] so as much as we are looking for rapture and watching as this revival that's happening in the bride of jesus christ not just here not just what we witnessed this week that brother sean martin's not just what we've been witnessing listen this is not built by man amen let me just share this with you in a denominational realm when they had revival they would the move would come among them with john wesley or maybe moody or those men when the move of god that wind jesus would use the term the wind bloweth where it lifteth no man know where it's come from or even where it goes and you can't explain it revival you just can't explain all you do is you enjoy the moment [Music] get in the moment when you see god moving you get in amen you get in don't stand and look at it don't be an observer you get in well i don't know what's going on here i'll tell you god's among us and it's not my this god himself the word is anchored in the souls of the [Applause] believers god has predestinated a bride that'll be born of his bone life of his life power of his power in moody's day or wesley's day the revival would come and generally the season of revival was about three years then men would grab a hold of it brother would use this term how can we preserve it let me just say anytime a man or a board gets a hold of a church that church becomes dead and formal listen this message should never become formal to us this message is more than books it's more than 10 seconds more than buildings and all the orchestra that it takes to have a service it's more than all of those things is [Applause] hallelujah now let me just share i and i want to go back and i forgive me for just a little bit but in hebrews chapter 11 individuals had revivals and now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen right for by it the owners obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appeal now that's got to become that's got to become personal revelation now we can read of abel got a revelation that it was going to take blood by faith he got a revelation to get back to god i've got to have a blood sacrifice are you with me now enoch was the sabbath from adam he got a revelation that god wrote the in the heavens the first bible and the scripture said it was about 60 years that enoch walked of his own accord but there was 300 years that enoch walked perfectly with god listen listen there were millions and maybe even billions of people on the earth but god was having fellowship with enoch and he was going to be a type of you [Applause] and he was going to take rapture and would not taste death don't talk about his family it don't talk about his cousins it's enoch and here's the revelation you gotta have if there's one going in virginia [Music] don't you get your eyes on nobody even sitting close to you they fail me they make mistakes you're looking at the wrong thing you've got to keep your eyes on jesus [Applause] don't you dare come to this church and just become a community member and we're here for an hour and a half is [Applause] abraham is mentioned in hebrews 11 sarah's mentioned listen as the older they got the more impossible that it became i hear the murmurs of people say well brother brown's been gone a long time and we're still here you better be glad because god was waiting on you [Applause] he was waiting on you some of you was not born in 1977. some of you were not born in 1965 and listen god will not leave a one [Music] that's the kind of businessman brother steve that in all of these trillion of people that is upon the earth he can have a rapture and not leave one of his children here to go through the tribulation period [Applause] now understand this just like with sodom he had to send this earth a messenger right before the coming of the great and the dreadful day of the lord now listen that messenger is to awaken the bride right now let me just say if this message didn't await you there's not another one coming amen to the gentile people we're not looking for another elijah no no no [Music] that's right come on we're not looking for another elijah but brother brother ron didn't you see all the thoughts in brother brown use that same microscope on yourself and then you'll get right with god [Applause] amen did you let's just just just think about it for a moment let's settle that question a lie uh listen brother branham made mistakes and he was very honest and told us that but i wasn't falling in love with william brown i was falling in love with jesus christ [Applause] brother branham would have killed six boys had not god stopped him from shooting amen the gun wouldn't go off and they went running off and once they got out of the scene the gun started shooting god preserved him [Applause] are you with me don't that scare you off brother ron no i read the bible and the bible talks about moses and he was a murderer but he wrote the first five books of the bible are you with me it wasn't moses that the people were falling in love with it was jehovah and i used all of that to tell you don't you fall in love with brother brown himself you fall in love with jesus christ i want to say that to you don't fall in love with me listen i want you to love me i want you to love brother brown i want you to be respectful to me but i'm not your savior i'm not trying to build a kingdom hill his kingdoms are very temporary we are here to prepare for the resurrection and the rapture [Applause] amen the scripture would say in hebrews chapter 11 toward the end and would name a lot of names here's what i'd like to say brother paul i'd like to say if it was written today which i believe it is being written that my name would be in there hallelujah it's good to hear read a bear arc samfond japan all of the ones there and they died in dens and caves refused to accept deliverance but i'd like my name written in there somewhere ron spencer lived in laodicea he was predestinated to live in laodicea and god built him in a way and gave him a message that he could live in laodicea and overcome [Applause] are you with me now now now notice it says in hebrews chapter 12 after all of after all of these names by faith by faith by faith in hebrews chapter 12 he says we're foresee and we are also compassed about was so great a cloud of witnesses and we can put what a couple hundred names from this local body that are in the scripture hey listen when they went into the ground they were looking for the coming of the lord the man that had the vision of this church in this place and worked so hard just ran out of time his faith didn't fail his revelation didn't fail him the message didn't fail him just time ran out for his body and the same expectation for the rapture he went into the ground with that's what he'll come up with [Applause] those people are the great clown witnesses and let us lay aside every weight and the sin which that so easily possess brother on but i don't have great sin in our life you're living in laodicea you're bombarded on every direction your age boasts to be enriched increased with goods and have need of nothing how many churches do church without god how many people let me preach how many people walked into church sat down for their arms and say entertain me for two hours are you watching me i want more than entertainment hello brother i can never be amazed that people have a better idea than you of how to run the church you've missionaried all over the world you've carried this message all over the world you've allowed you've won thousands of souls for jesus christ and i'm talking about thousands and god lays something on your heart to preach and you know that it's a pivotal moment you know that we're we're getting ready to be moved into something god's ushering us into something the exodus is going on the rapture is happening right and yet people's got a better idea of how to do things i'd say you need to get saved now maybe that wasn't for you but it's for the person that wrote that letter to me so amen it wasn't here now notice this let us run i was sitting in a meeting sister connie and i were young converts we had no children at that time we were sitting in a meeting and i heard one of my mentors preach a sermon called let us run and he talked about the saints of the ages and the power of the generals of the ages and they lived their time and they had their revivals the revival came and he would talk about men like robert goldford talk about moody and he talked about peter cartwright which we all can attach to because he came from this area peter cartwright preached here in this in this area and he was a kind of a guy that he would go to a meeting and if and if a fight broke out and people were protesting in the meeting and a fight broke out he'd just take his jacket off and be the first one in it he and brother homer would have been a match are you with me and and one night about 30 men walked in and wanted to break the meeting up he didn't stop the meeting and go whining he just pulled his jacket off and walked back there and began to pummel one after another amen brother ronner are you talking about a preacher with 30 men yeah listen god's not a dainty god i heard last night that one man killed a thousand people [Applause] shamgar a man that was a farmer took a six-foot stick in his hand and killed a thousand men that were trained warriors what can god do with the child of god in his hand [Applause] i said in that meeting in i don't know 84 or 86 somewhere in that neighborhood i said in that meeting and i thought about what if those men gave their life don't let me waste my time are you with me don't let me waste my time whatever my time on earth is don't let me waste my time don't let me waste 24 hours don't let me waste a weekend and in that meeting god changed my life forever and that's why i walk into this service this morning after meeting the angel lord in the room and i can stand here and preach with passion and i encourage you to come to these meetings in the same atmosphere oh brother and i didn't get nothing out of it what did you put in in first john 1 1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and showing to you that eternal life which was with the father and manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ i want to say i want to say to you i want you to bring the scripture to right now we've seen this message we've heard it our hands have handled it we're witnesses of what this word has has done to us we have become new creatures all things are passed away and the champion is living on the inside of us [Applause] we would have ran out of energies but the champion chose to live in this temple [Applause] now he didn't just choose to live in this temple he's got a purpose for being here we've seen him we have felt him we've experienced him ii peter 1 16 for we have not followed commonly devised fables when we were made known unto you by the power and the coming of the lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from god the father honor and glory when there were came such a voice to him from the absolute glory this is my beloved son in whom we are well pleased he could say it boldly because he was standing there i always like a real personal witness oh yeah there's nothing better for a court trial than an eyewitness amen that'll tell the truth hard to find but but an eyewitness will tell the truth peter james and john were eyewitnesses to tell the truth and it was more than just a supernatural event they was watching the deity of god this is more than a prophet he's more than a man this is the messiah now listen it was so anchored until these men would have to give their life for it notice the next words we have a more sure word of prophecy this is just not fables and this is not just something that's put together this message is more than the mind of a man this is just not fables put together right amen this is just not a church to where you come and you're sitting you just listen poetry or just some pretty scriptures that are put together god's not a mission are you with me he's transforming a group of people because god cannot rapture tape recorders he cannot rapture your equipment of devices that you listen to what his intention to do is not not rapture this but to rapture this living in human claims [Applause] are you with me brother shannon what changed you he changed you didn't happen at the same time maybe he didn't even understand it and it was supernatural now it's hard to explain how it happened amen but you will stand peter said i was an eyewitness i was an eyewitness now what happened the champion came to the inside of you [Applause] you can't overcome you try to try it and try to forgive me i just pick you up he tried to try and try to try but let me just say this to you you make vow after violent promise after promise but when he comes i love that it's nothing to go back to brother ron but i you know i'm so consumed by my job don't worry they'll get rid of you don't worry don't worry that's why you can't go to a restaurant now and get waited on hardly because the government's paying more for you to just stay at home [Music] but i owe my my manufacturer my life don't worry they can move it to mexico oh but i'm so consumed about my money don't worry inflation or eat it right up i'm so consumed with my house don't worry a tornado can come through and in three minutes make it just a just a crumbling straw oh but i've got to have a certain certain car i just bought a new car here the other day it's not a new one but i bought another car here the other day and the guy he was standing there congratulating me on buying the car and all that kind of thing and i was thinking in my mind time lasts long enough that car will become a tin can amen [Applause] it'll become a 10-ton they'll send it to us ram and they'll shred that thing and copper will go this way and metal go this way and that title will be gone somewhere amen don't fall in love with the car don't fall in love with your house go out you put jesus first he'll get you the car he'll get you the house he'll give you the job you i want the secret to success put him [Applause] first [Applause] some people chinch around about a penny or a dollar or they're they're tore up about their bank accounts or you shouldn't tell their wife you shouldn't have did this you shouldn't have done that and tell their husband they shouldn't have done this and they shouldn't have done that they fight on their way to church come on i'm reading you don't you worry i can read you right let me tell you something about your money money will send you to hell [Music] [Applause] you know this is time of year everybody starts getting naked oh let me tell you about a place where people are going to be naked make it in here someday i ought to preach on that naked what you do that for brother ron you was preaching good until all of a sudden you did because you're missing your opportunity here you're sitting there waiting on me to get done on you your country hands out your weight on here [Applause] wow [Applause] don't you know i'm so and so i can care that's what your name is [Applause] i'm not impressed by how much money you got i'm not impressed by what kind of car you drove i'm not impressed with what kind of house you live in i'm not even impressed with what kind of talent you walk on this stage and seeing amazing gray sounds we can sound like if you don't live right i can't figure out what your talent is if you're not born again you're going to hate [Applause] hey amen now that's what the devil gets for making me dizzy all morning [Applause] god's not watching everything brother ron okay well let me just sure let me just share a little story brother i said let us turn our in what thank you of christ he said let's just turn our cameras this morning and look up yonder in heaven and break out of this dimension and look yonder when things are so dreary here and always something going in there's something always going on in another world that's right yes sir i can see him sitting there as a prince sitting there it's great garments hanging around him daniel saw him one time too he said he come like the ancient of days whose hair was white as wool and while he was sitting there on his throne i can see an angel went up to him by the name of gabriel with his sword pulled and said master have you looked down in babylon this morning well they're about to burn up three believers down there and that heat's about to come on them and they're about to burn up with three believers have you noticed them and i can hear him say i've watched them all night long and his eyes is on the sparrow and i know he watches me and he watches you he set his eyes on the sparrow and i sing because i'm happy i sing because i'm free for his eye is on the sparrow and i know he watches me and he's standing there and he said yes sir gabriel i i know you're a good angel and you could go down there and destroy that thing but i've watched them all night long this is the god that created the sun the moon the stars mars jupiter he's the one that created all that i heard elon musk say this week that he's going to go to mars and he knows he'll die i i'd like to write him and tell him i'm going to go by mars and i'm going to live [Applause] it's okay to have a little fun in it and i could see another angel come up with this name one wood and he destroyed the antilubrian world with by water and he controls the waters and he's going to somehow thing he's going to he's going to do something in the last days with them turn them all bitter and i can hear him run up right quick and fall down before the majesty and say oh master have you looked down there the angels are concerned about what we believe about christ have you considered them there and they're just about to burn up three believers i have controls of the water and at your command i'll just i'll just let me go down and i'll wash babylon off of the face of the earth brother brown said i believe you could have did it amen i was thinking about los angeles this morning as i was looking at the scripture brother branham said los angeles just slip right in the ocean i was thinking about wormwood be right in control of those things but don't you wait till los angeles drops in the ocean for you to get right with god amen let me just stop there man i'm not going to be much longer heard a i heard a report this morning i was listening and i tried to i tried to find it but michigan has just ran a study on how many people has died off of the earth even in india about that it's uncounted they know about 300 000 has died perished already in india and they are having cremations all over the india is literally becoming a cremation ward and they used to term they said it's becoming we can't count them it's becoming a missing of people a mission of people and i thought to myself you know won't be long maybe michigan can run another report [Applause] there was people in elkton and grotto's and harrisonburg and up in rock bridge and across the mountain in madison they just got missing call your neighbors you can call the authorities but the foolish virgin will know what happened [Applause] it'll be another missing of people amen he said i believe he could have done it he said let me go down there and i'll change the picture this morning there is men who believe in you they're mortals and yet believe these are angels talking to god and reminding him of his promise toward his children and god listens to these angels amen they've never seen but they know that moses said that the lord your god will raise up a prophet like unto me they knew what he was coming and by faith they looked forward to the coming of the son of god let's hear them testify saying then i look back and and there and i see i see wormwood you're a good angel you've obeyed me you've done just what i told you to do but i can't let you go for this is a man's size job i'm going myself yeah i'm going myself i'm not going to send you to do something that i'm going to do myself [Music] and i can hear him reach over there and say come here east wind and west wind and north and south and and everything's in the solar system it's in my command and they obey him and turns at his command but i but the heart of man thinks they know more than god does amen and he can't touch the stony heart of a man how i think this morning he could say let winter change to summer and summer to winter and it obey him like that he could say mars you go over here in jupiter you go over there it would obey him he could speak it there he stands in his majesty and when man fails to recognize him when he stood yonder who why who what is that man is mindful of him when he stood there in this space when there was nothing else before there was even a star in the heavens before there was a sun in the heavens he blowed him off of his hand and he created a son the god that did that said today i'm going down and i'm going to get in a fire ain't no god that's in a yeah i'm fire here because he met me in a fire and it came to a point to where they would say where you were that brother nathanael they were making decisions they're good doctors they're doing their best even i'll see them tomorrow they're doing their best to preserve my life but i believe another report [Applause] they said in a few hours we'll harvest these organs i needed them to preach to you this morning [Applause] i'm not going to get finished i haven't hardly touched my notes but i'll just save it till next week that would be okay [Applause] just think about that god that said come here east wind west north and south i may have that backwards all the way standing on this compass now but he called for the the cloud to ride on brother brown said he'd get on a zigzag lightning amen he used those words zigzag you know look that up look up zig zach this isn't science just zigzag and in a moment god of the heavens was standing in a fire i thought of that this morning as i walked into my office and i felt his presence and i begin to consciously aware brother nathanael that he's been here waiting on me i thought about those three hebrew children as i'm coming to the end he was standing in the fire waiting on them to come andrew as you so phenomenally spoke last night lazarus they were pushing against they were pushing against a stone and there's no way that they could comprehend i'll be fixing this dinner in just a couple of hours i love it i absolutely love it i just told this young lad my son before i walked out i said he was looking at the monitor and it was showing all of you as you were worshiping and i said it's hard to comprehend but all of those people are getting ready to turn young [Applause] [Music] brother bill it may not look it but me and you are the same age amen it may not feel it but we're the same age this outer shell might be showing a different thing but in god's thoughts in god's thoughts just as much as he was standing there what we're experiencing now is a revival that's preparing to change your body thank you lord here's where i want to come to now i want to come thomas says it means something to you the revival that's going on now is what me and your daddy talked about in that back office we couldn't make it happen it had to wait on its season but we knew it was coming our prophet told us it was coming oh you may be looking to see great things this is that happening but what you don't realize what god's doing in these services is taking you one step at another changing your body and when you can't see him he's moving when you can't feel him he's moving he's doing work [Applause] thank you what are your expectations brother ron and i'm sorry i'm sorry i've just jumped over all over the place but i hope you're catching some of this i can't wait for the service and you know we say those words i can't wait sometimes i can't wait after sunday afternoon to get back here saturday night and then it comes and then you're waiting for sunday morning then you're here but i can't wait for the service to when people start walking in this building and our bodies start turning young you know we're talking about labor day and i could feel some of you thinking well where are we going to put everybody don't worry we've got about 200 people that's going to step from that dimension to this dimension we're going to all be the same age sam nicholson's going to be here he's going to be there wayne goodman's going to be there homer's going to do that you can name your loved ones listen that's what our eyes are going to see [Applause] you see this young man in a state trooper uniform over here it was just only it was just over just over a year ago he was about his own life and about his own things and no thoughts of coming to church no thoughts of ever doing what he's doing but in the in a moment it changed [Applause] you can keep standing the musicians come but he's raised in the message in a good home you know what the message was and i heard you as a boy i heard you as a boy talk about the message those things but after that moment with him it changed your life forever tell you what he did in that moment he made a decision i'm gonna i'm gonna go if i have to i'm gonna live with brother ron i'm gonna go live with my uncle and all of a sudden the uncle wasn't just his uncle amen all of a sudden staying in my home seeing the message operate messages more than books and tapes but seeing the message operate and the peace the peace that it produces the atmosphere that's not just the churches at home are you with me it put it in his heart that he wanted to move and just listen within months god took care of his job his wife hallelujah he took care of his finances if you put him first [Applause] the champion will come and live inside of you [Applause] amen amen i didn't get to my notes but we'll try to do that next week if that's all right amen could we sing that song what a day that will be amen my lord

he's concerned about you too he's concerned about you sister donna he's concerned about you he's concerned about things that you can't see amen he's making a way for provisions of things that's going to come your way nothing takes him by surprise he said brother i didn't know how i got here what am i doing sitting in church this morning he's concerned about you i may not know you i may have never shook your hand but that don't matter to know to know me is it very small but to know him as everything now just like in the same moment you're standing here in a few days in god's time we'll be sitting across a table from one another [Music] i believe we could say it's been worth it hey dad yeah i sat across the table young and he wiped the tears from her eyes [Music] i believe you know all the trouble that you're going through now and the sacrifices you're making now difficulties the distresses that you're going through i want to tell you i believe it would be worth it oh yeah it's
