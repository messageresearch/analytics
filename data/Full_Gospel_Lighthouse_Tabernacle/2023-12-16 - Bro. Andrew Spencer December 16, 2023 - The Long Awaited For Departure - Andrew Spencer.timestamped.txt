[43:15] that we are in the presence of the
[43:17] mighty
[43:18] Angel one that did not go off the scene
[43:21] in 1965 but we recognize that there is
[43:25] there there's one still with the message
[43:28] today that's guiding its children all
[43:30] throughout the inheritance that is laid
[43:33] here from Genesis to

[45:05] text tonight I pray that you would be
[45:08] the one that would speak Lord Jesus may
[45:11] you come and visit us Lord vindicate
[45:13] your promises and we'll be careful to
[45:16] serve you and give you praise in the
[45:18] name of Jesus Christ amen and amen if
[45:22] you have your Bibles this evening would
[45:24] like to look over in the book of Luke
[45:28] 3 Luke chap 3 and then Romans chapter 8
[45:32] and verse
[45:38] 18 Luke chapter 3 and we'll start with
[45:41] uh verse 15 we recognize as as you're
[45:45] turning here to Luke chapter 3 that we
[45:47] recognize that this is when we begin to
[45:49] see the entrance of John the Baptist and
[45:53] his ministry as it's coming into full
[45:55] effect it's already been prophesied and
[45:58] now we are watching the the ministry of
[46:01] John come into full effect and and and
[46:05] there we see as it is perfectly aligning
[46:08] with with with Malachi's prophecy and
[46:12] Isaiah's prophecy and now we we we're
[46:15] just tapping in here just to catch this
[46:18] catch this Vision in Luke 3 and verse1
[46:21] 15 and as the people were in expectation
[46:25] and all men mused in their hearts of
[46:28] John whether he were the Christ or not
[46:31] and John answered saying unto them all I
[46:35] indeed baptize you with water but one
[46:38] mightier than I cometh the latchees of
[46:41] his shoes I am not worthy to unloose he
[46:44] shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[46:47] and with fire whose fan is in his hand
[46:49] and he will thoroughly Purge his floor
[46:52] and GA and will gather the wheat into
[46:54] his Garner but the Chas fa he will burn
[46:57] with fire unquenchable also Romans chap
[47:01] 8 and verse
[47:10] 18 Romans chapter 8 verse 18 for I
[47:14] reckon that the sufferings of this
[47:16] present time are not worthy to be
[47:19] compared with the glory which shall be
[47:22] revealed in us for the earnest expect
[47:26] ation of the creature waiteth for the
[47:29] manifestation of the sons of God for the
[47:32] creature was made subject to vanity not
[47:34] willingly but by reason of him who hath
[47:38] subjected the same in Hope because the
[47:41] creature itself also shall be delivered
[47:43] from the bondage of corruption into the
[47:46] Glorious Liberty of the children of God
[47:49] for we know that the whole creation
[47:51] granth and travaileth in pain together
[47:53] until now and not only they but
[47:56] ourselves also which have the first
[47:59] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[48:01] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[48:05] adoption to with the Redemption of our
[48:07] body for we are saved by hope but hope
[48:10] that is seen is not hope for what a man
[48:13] seeth why do he yet hope for but what
[48:16] but if we hope for that we see not then
[48:20] do we with patience wait for it may God
[48:23] bless his word you may be seated to
[48:25] tonight in the presence of the Lord and
[48:27] I don't want to keep you too long here
[48:29] tonight but I I do want to take a few
[48:31] moments and I want to speak to you on a
[48:34] text that I I I I delivered some of
[48:36] these things last weekend and told you
[48:38] that I was going to be speaking on this
[48:40] thought on the long awaited for
[48:43] departure or the long awaited for
[48:46] fulfillment and I would like to just
[48:48] take some of those those same thoughts
[48:50] that we looked at last weekend or maybe
[48:52] we could just tie them some of those
[48:54] same things together but we we we want
[48:57] to look at this thought here and as
[48:59] we've we've read here in Romans chapter
[49:01] 8 we recognize that the scripture is is
[49:04] a present day newspaper and we recognize
[49:07] that it is it is up to dat and it is
[49:09] fresh to us and we recognize by the
[49:12] scripture reading here this evening that
[49:14] this scripture in Romans chapter 8 it
[49:16] signifies to us that the supernatural
[49:19] element of the Unseen that yet we we
[49:22] have not fully enjoyed all of the
[49:25] benefits of the Unseen it is showing to
[49:27] us something that that if we hope for
[49:30] that we see not then we do with patience
[49:32] wait for it it is showing to us that
[49:34] there is something in the future and yes
[49:37] we recognize that we are sitting here
[49:39] that we are under a restoration of the
[49:41] brid tree that we are understanding that
[49:43] all of the Mysteries have been revealed
[49:45] to the body of Jesus Christ but yet
[49:47] there is something that is on the inside
[49:49] of us that is groaning for the full
[49:52] manifestations of the adoptions of this
[49:55] body which is the body change so we
[49:57] recognize that we're not fully enjoying
[50:00] all of the benefits that are laying here
[50:02] but it's something that is saying that
[50:04] it's something that we're hoping for if
[50:06] we see it then why should we wait for it
[50:08] so we don't have to wait for something
[50:10] that we already have but yet we are
[50:12] fully here and we are waiting on our
[50:15] body change is that right I believe that
[50:17] every person here as as the day goes on
[50:20] as we get older in our life it's
[50:22] something that we long for it's
[50:24] something that is constantly that is on
[50:26] our mind it is upon that body change
[50:28] when you wake up in the morning and
[50:29] you've got a new you've got a new
[50:31] backache you've got something new you
[50:33] begin to your eyes as your eyes begin to
[50:35] get dim you begin to look under those
[50:37] things and this is what Paul is saying
[50:39] here is that that we are hoping unto
[50:41] these things and many may not understand
[50:44] this but I believe that predestination
[50:47] is driving Humanity in the ministry or
[50:50] Angelic Messengers in this hour to to
[50:54] fulfill the very mysteries of almighty
[50:57] God I believe that it's predestination
[50:59] that is making men take thoughts of like
[51:02] of what William Brandon would say and
[51:04] things that are to be and then we would
[51:05] look in Third Exodus and things of of of
[51:08] modern events made clear by prophecy but
[51:11] I believe that it is predestination that
[51:13] is driving man to look into these things
[51:16] and to pull out the Hidden Truths and to
[51:18] tie these things together for the body
[51:20] of Jesus Christ and I personally believe
[51:23] that there are key components that are
[51:25] laying there and maybe you don't fully
[51:27] understand why why do these people why
[51:30] do why do men of God keep studying why
[51:32] do men of God keep keep studying these
[51:34] things out they we've heard these tapes
[51:36] we've read these things we've we've
[51:37] looked over these scriptures of maybe
[51:39] hundreds or thousands of times I
[51:41] personally have listened to Christ the
[51:43] mystery of God over 300 times but yet
[51:46] there's something on the inside of me
[51:48] that makes me long to listen to more of
[51:50] it but what is it I believe that it is
[51:53] predestination that is driving Humanity
[51:56] or driving the ministry because because
[51:59] maybe you don't fully understand or
[52:01] maybe you don't capture the whole Vision
[52:02] here but I believe that it is that it is
[52:05] the predestinated mind of God that men
[52:07] would stay driven that men would stay
[52:10] passionate where because we're looking
[52:11] for that last seed I I believe that that
[52:14] last seed is the most valuable seed and
[52:16] I believe that it's that that last seed
[52:18] is is just is as valuable as you are
[52:21] here tonight and maybe you've heard
[52:22] these things and maybe you've read these
[52:24] things and maybe You' come to full
[52:26] maturity in it but I believe that
[52:27] there's one seed left maybe there's a
[52:29] few seeds left and I believe that we
[52:31] ought to study these things and preach
[52:33] these things with everything that is
[52:35] within us and it and it might be maybe
[52:37] it's just above you just a little bit or
[52:39] maybe maybe you think well I'm on thee
[52:41] of that but there's somebody there
[52:43] there's somebody there's one seed that's
[52:45] got to be watered there's there's
[52:46] another seed that's got to be mature
[52:48] there's another seed that's got to come
[52:49] to life and when she comes
[52:52] in we will go is that right I believe
[52:55] that that that that last seed brother
[52:58] bisco would say it like this that the
[53:00] last seed would be the most costly seed
[53:02] because thousands of miles have been put
[53:05] on for that last seed thousands of tapes
[53:07] have been played thousands of visions
[53:09] and thousands of things have been put
[53:11] into fruition for that last seed and
[53:14] I'll say this that we are a lighthouse
[53:16] that is still looking for that last seed
[53:19] that we're still pointing that there is
[53:21] a God in this gen in this
[53:24] generation
[53:25] I don't believe that we ought to back up
[53:27] and I don't believe that we ought to
[53:29] that we ought to step back off of his
[53:31] promises but I believe that we ought to
[53:33] be looking for that last one it could be
[53:35] your
[53:36] neighbor it could be your loved one it
[53:38] could be and I'd say that it's worth
[53:40] testifying about I believe that it's
[53:42] worth preaching about tonight I believe
[53:44] that what Jesus came to do I believe he
[53:47] is doing it in the bride's body for this
[53:50] we know that brother Brandon would teach
[53:51] us that predestination looks back to for
[53:54] knowledge
[53:55] and for knowledge looks on to Destiny so
[53:58] we recognize that God all the way back
[54:00] there in the very beginning that he he
[54:02] saw all of these things as they were
[54:04] coming into fruition he saw that last
[54:07] seed he saw you and I believe that you
[54:09] have a destiny here tonight I don't
[54:11] believe that your destiny is to be sick
[54:13] and I do not believe that your destiny
[54:15] is to live here in Le osia and
[54:17] constantly be tormented by Le osia but I
[54:20] believe that there is something that is
[54:22] on the inside of this bride's body that
[54:24] she's constantly longing for I believe
[54:27] that it is the full manifestation of the
[54:30] sons of God that we take this body
[54:32] change if Enoch could be translated and
[54:35] he lived so close to God I believe that
[54:38] in this generation that there's going to
[54:39] be a people that have long awaited that
[54:42] same translation that same horse of fire
[54:45] to come sweeping by her way I believe
[54:48] that it's something that we waited for
[54:51] but I do not believe it's it's too far
[54:53] out there in front of us
[54:56] I'm not trying to stick a carrot out in
[54:58] front of the horse and say it's way out
[55:00] there but I'm trying to say to you that
[55:03] you can have everything that is laying
[55:05] right here in the promises of God and I
[55:08] know there's a lot of people that like
[55:09] to put things off in the future that one
[55:11] day we'll become the sons of God but 1
[55:14] John 3 and2 tells us that now are we the
[55:17] sons of God you don't have to wait to
[55:19] fully manifest yourself you don't have
[55:21] to wait until the preacher prays for you
[55:24] you don't have to set there and wait for
[55:26] the pastor to come and lay his hands
[55:27] upon you but I believe that right now
[55:29] where you are as a son and daughter of
[55:32] God that you can fully manifest yourself
[55:34] as an robed adopted son and daughter of
[55:38] God I believe that this voice of
[55:40] Resurrection is in the bride's body that
[55:43] one of these mornings between the hours
[55:45] of 6 and N the thing that we've waited
[55:47] for the thing that we've longed for that
[55:50] voice of Resurrection that called to
[55:52] Lazarus and said come forth that voice
[55:55] of Resurrection in the bride's body will
[55:58] call for her body
[56:01] change
[56:03] hallelujah hallelujah now look you got
[56:06] to think about this that as we read we
[56:09] read the Bible and we think about it and
[56:12] so so many times we look back at it as a
[56:14] book of history but you've got to think
[56:16] that Paul was in the same spot that you
[56:19] are in Paul was looking for the second
[56:21] coming of Christ just like you're
[56:23] looking for it you see because if Christ
[56:26] would have stood back there and told the
[56:28] ages now look it's going to be another
[56:29] 2,000 years before I come again before
[56:33] my second coming if he would have told
[56:35] the generations or the church ages then
[56:38] you would see men of old and you would
[56:40] see that the church would get laxed or
[56:42] they would have fell short on the work
[56:44] of the Lord but God had them believing
[56:48] that it was going to be just in their
[56:49] hour it's just they had to have that
[56:52] anticipation that it was getting ready
[56:54] to happen happened and they were living
[56:56] out the message for their day as he was
[56:59] coming right there and I believe that's
[57:01] the way you ought to live right now I
[57:03] don't care I don't I don't know if it's
[57:05] 10 years from now but I believe that you
[57:07] ought to live like it's
[57:09] today now notice what brother bam said
[57:11] in the question question and answers
[57:14] there's a question that came to him on
[57:15] the in the seals it said should
[57:17] evangelist continue on the field and I'm
[57:19] just going to hit the highlights here he
[57:21] said but certainly by all means don't
[57:23] change a thing he said if Jesus is
[57:25] coming in the morning Preach Today like
[57:27] it was going like it was going to be 10
[57:29] years from today but live like it's
[57:31] going to be this hour he said if you're
[57:34] building a house put it on up he said if
[57:36] Jesus comes tomorrow you'd be found
[57:38] faithful at the duty he said if you're
[57:40] building your church go on put it up he
[57:43] said continue right on just go right on
[57:46] as you are he said now for instance if
[57:48] you was working for a man and you know
[57:50] it was 15 minutes before quitting time
[57:52] well you'd say it's it's just 15 minutes
[57:54] it's more or so I might as well just go
[57:56] over here and sit down he said you have
[57:59] got docked for that 15 minutes he said
[58:02] if you're planting wheat plant your
[58:03] wheat if you're digging potatoes go on
[58:06] and dig them out well say well nobody
[58:08] will eat them that don't make any
[58:10] difference you dig them out anyhow just
[58:13] continue on as you are you see why
[58:15] you've been preaching the same message
[58:16] for all these years I'm still continuing
[58:19] on as I am I ought to live today like he
[58:23] coming today I lived and I preached like
[58:26] he was coming 15 years ago and I
[58:28] believed it then as much as I believe it
[58:31] right
[58:33] now he said you just continue on as you
[58:36] are he said you'll be found faithful at
[58:38] the post of Duty he said well you say
[58:40] brother Bram if he was to come in the
[58:42] morning shouldn't you be out there he
[58:44] said no sir this is my post of Duty I'll
[58:47] be standing right here preaching when he
[58:48] comes saying the same things I am then
[58:51] when he comes I'll just move right on
[58:53] out with him
[58:56] he said if I'm hoing potatoes then I'll
[58:58] go on just to Ho away as hard as I can
[59:01] he said when he comes in I just drop the
[59:03] hoe and take off he said but you
[59:05] remember in the Jubilee year he said
[59:07] when they was hoing with that hoe he
[59:09] said they just kept on hoing he said
[59:11] they know that the Jubilee years wasn't
[59:14] more maybe more than 10 minutes more and
[59:16] the trumpet would sound for the Jubilee
[59:18] year he said but they just kept on
[59:20] pitching hay or whatever they was doing
[59:22] he said but when the trumpet sounded
[59:25] they Dro their Pitchfork and gone don't
[59:28] you know that this message has already
[59:30] sounded to this bride Generation all
[59:33] you've got to do is lay off your old
[59:35] sins lay off everything that's a part
[59:39] of well glory to God there's men of
[59:43] passion that still believe in living out
[59:45] the message there's men that are driven
[59:48] to believe the
[59:50] message just as we said it last weekend
[59:53] when men would rise up underneath of
[59:55] Paul like polycarp and they would carry
[59:57] on the message just like it was in
[59:59] Wesley's day there would be men like
[1:00:01] finny and SMI Smith Wigglesworth that
[1:00:03] would rise up Spurgeon and they would
[1:00:05] rise up and they would carry on the
[1:00:07] message of that day so is it in this
[1:00:10] hour there have been men that have rose
[1:00:13] up under their anointed seventh angel
[1:00:15] Messenger to carry on the message men
[1:00:19] like Ed
[1:00:20] bisco that would not refuse to believe
[1:00:23] that the message was over over until he
[1:00:26] completely got it into every language
[1:00:29] somebody was going to rise up under
[1:00:30] their messenger and be anointed to
[1:00:32] carried out men like Tim puit when
[1:00:35] people told him that he shouldn't have
[1:00:36] been preaching when he was 15 years old
[1:00:38] he started pastoring started preaching
[1:00:40] 17 years old started
[1:00:43] pastoring but though they were they were
[1:00:45] anointed under their messenger men like
[1:00:48] men like David mayor men like Ron
[1:00:51] Spencer men like Jason Jackson men like
[1:00:53] Wayne law and men like these brothers
[1:00:56] and sisters that are sitting
[1:00:58] here what are they doing they're under
[1:01:01] the anointing of the messenger of this
[1:01:03] age and I'm going to say it to you like
[1:01:05] your Prophet said unto you that there is
[1:01:08] another again another people in the land
[1:01:10] who under their
[1:01:13] messenger not outside of your messenger
[1:01:16] not out there believing what the church
[1:01:17] world is doing but under your messenger
[1:01:20] will be the final voice to the final
[1:01:23] age you say well brother Andrew it's
[1:01:25] Christmas season preach to us a
[1:01:27] Christmas message this is the greatest
[1:01:29] gift that ever has been given it's Jesus
[1:01:41] Christ God would raise up men and
[1:01:44] preserve them for this
[1:01:46] hour he would deposit Homer Fraser in
[1:01:50] this in this area he would deposit
[1:01:53] Donnie Reagan and in in Kentucky and
[1:01:55] move him to Tennessee he would he would
[1:01:58] deposit men like Billy Andrews and then
[1:02:00] raise up a generation of
[1:02:02] Believers men like Josh
[1:02:06] Bennett what is it it's God Gathering
[1:02:09] his seed that he thought of before the
[1:02:12] foundation of the world he thought of
[1:02:15] them he didn't think of them as losers
[1:02:17] he thought of them as winners he didn't
[1:02:19] think of them as quitters he thought of
[1:02:21] them as
[1:02:23] Overcomers now if God has got a Ministry
[1:02:26] that still believes that this is an
[1:02:29] angel's message then there's got to be a
[1:02:31] people that step in line to that message
[1:02:34] and get in line with that message let me
[1:02:37] tell you Church there is no Rapture
[1:02:40] outside of this
[1:02:43] message and I know that's hard for the
[1:02:45] church world to understand that but I
[1:02:47] believe that there's got to be a full
[1:02:50] restoration back to the Church of the
[1:02:52] Living God and we're not waiting waiting
[1:02:54] for that no more because we already have
[1:02:57] that come on somebody you're not waiting
[1:03:00] on Malachi for it to come and to preach
[1:03:02] the message the message has already been
[1:03:05] preached all you're waiting on is for
[1:03:07] your body to catch up with a
[1:03:11] vision come on somebody we've already
[1:03:13] preached that God sent a prophet but how
[1:03:16] about preaching God's got a bride God's
[1:03:18] got a wife God's got an elect lady
[1:03:21] that's carrying on this last day message
[1:03:23] that will four feel every bit of Malachi
[1:03:28] [Applause]
[1:03:30] four what is
[1:03:32] it
[1:03:34] elaser was hunting out a
[1:03:36] bride brother brandham said he wasn't
[1:03:39] looking for the denominations in the
[1:03:40] Creed he said because they had surely
[1:03:43] they had a lot of quantities out there
[1:03:45] he said but what elezra was looking for
[1:03:47] was quality he was looking for a
[1:03:49] character that would match Isaac's
[1:03:53] character or was it when El ezrael was
[1:03:56] coming and he was preaching what was he
[1:03:58] doing he was hunting out a bride I
[1:04:01] believe some of these young boys ought
[1:04:03] to get to hunting out thems a bride but
[1:04:05] I believe that it's a spirit of the age
[1:04:08] I'm going to preach just a little bit
[1:04:10] Pastor right here but I believe that
[1:04:12] it's a a spirit of the age that makes
[1:04:14] people want to long till they're about
[1:04:16] 30 years old and they've got themselves
[1:04:18] good and
[1:04:19] established before they ever gets a
[1:04:23] wife
[1:04:24] you watch now you watch it's a spirit of
[1:04:27] an age that'll come upon a man that'll
[1:04:29] make him go and start looking after men
[1:04:34] things that's a devil right there let me
[1:04:37] ask you you said well you got P you got
[1:04:39] parents today that's well you ought to
[1:04:41] wait till they got at least $80,000 in
[1:04:43] the bank got a home got a home that they
[1:04:45] can live in got all these all these fine
[1:04:48] qualities of things how many of y'all
[1:04:50] had
[1:04:52] that come on somebody all we had was two
[1:04:55] nickel to rub together I could barely
[1:04:58] afford well I ain't going to tell no lie
[1:05:00] but I couldn't afford what I can afford
[1:05:02] now but back then I'd have thought man I
[1:05:05] was a popper compared to what things are
[1:05:07] like now just a different world but to
[1:05:10] think that people have set it up and
[1:05:12] established well I you know what you
[1:05:13] ought to quarter for two and a half
[1:05:15] years and then let me tell you that's
[1:05:17] going to get you in in trouble
[1:05:19] brother and people that believe in them
[1:05:21] long engagements they ask him for
[1:05:25] trouble I'm done with my pastoral work
[1:05:27] we're getting back to evangelism just
[1:05:29] for a minute then I'll jump back to it
[1:05:31] Brothers get yourself a wife and get
[1:05:35] yourself married if she's the right one
[1:05:37] stop waiting
[1:05:39] around on Miss Perfect on somebody that
[1:05:42] stepped out
[1:05:43] of out of a magazine this message is
[1:05:48] everything that you have need of if you
[1:05:50] see the qualities of Rebecca on the
[1:05:54] inside of her it doesn't matter if she's
[1:05:57] got every hair in line or whether she's
[1:05:59] got a million dollars in the
[1:06:05] bank y'all hear me that's going to
[1:06:08] everybody on internet because I have
[1:06:10] been sat down and talked to around this
[1:06:13] message with young
[1:06:14] people what's the problem brother Andrew
[1:06:17] it seems like they wait until they're 28
[1:06:19] years old until they want to get married
[1:06:21] anymore that wasn't my problem
[1:06:28] let tell you something there's a few
[1:06:29] guys had their eyes on that girl right
[1:06:31] there but when I showed
[1:06:36] up I'm sorry Dan D told me I got the
[1:06:39] prettiest girl in Tennessee and I took
[1:06:40] her to Virginia and I said yes sir sure
[1:06:43] did thank you
[1:06:46] Lord all right let me get back to
[1:06:51] hope y'all right out there y'all
[1:06:53] breathing
[1:06:55] all right don't go out and marry
[1:06:57] somebody you don't know
[1:07:01] but there's a lot of ways you can
[1:07:03] interpret that but I trust you know what
[1:07:05] I'm
[1:07:06] saying what was what was El eer doing he
[1:07:09] was hunting for a bride somebody that
[1:07:11] was going to match the match Piece of
[1:07:14] Heaven what did William brandham do he
[1:07:16] didn't come here and preach to all he
[1:07:18] didn't preach to the denomination to
[1:07:20] Pentecostals the Pentecostals thought
[1:07:22] they already had him but there elaser
[1:07:25] was hunting out a bride that would match
[1:07:28] the king of Heaven there was something
[1:07:31] in heaven that was longing for a wife
[1:07:34] that could be a part of him that could
[1:07:36] be bone of his bone life of his life
[1:07:38] power of his
[1:07:40] power what was it when eleazer saw
[1:07:43] Rebecca doing what he prayed
[1:07:46] for he said that's the one that I prayed
[1:07:49] for she got under the inspiration of
[1:07:52] elzar's prayer what what did this last
[1:07:54] day bride do she got under the anointing
[1:07:58] of Malachi th and he was hun for a bride
[1:08:01] that would wash that would worship that
[1:08:04] would carry water to her camels that
[1:08:07] would carry her back to her Heavenly
[1:08:11] bridegroom what are you doing what are
[1:08:14] you doing Rebecca every single time you
[1:08:16] start carrying that water praise and he
[1:08:18] start watering those camels you are
[1:08:21] praising the power that will take you to
[1:08:23] your
[1:08:26] classic yeah some people don't
[1:08:28] understand that but Rebecca the more she
[1:08:30] carried the more she carried the more
[1:08:33] she was given strength for her to take
[1:08:35] her Rapture and the more you praise and
[1:08:38] the more you give and the more you love
[1:08:41] and the more you show it shows that
[1:08:44] there's a match piece here on Earth and
[1:08:47] the marriage certificate of the baptism
[1:08:49] of the Holy Ghost is shown in this
[1:08:51] bride's
[1:08:52] body
[1:08:55] now notice notice what the Bible said
[1:08:57] but if we hope for that we see not then
[1:09:00] do we with patience wait for it so
[1:09:03] there's got to be an expectation so
[1:09:06] where there is a strong desire for an
[1:09:08] object or a corresponding expectation of
[1:09:11] obtaining it so there's got to be
[1:09:13] something that longs for it there's got
[1:09:16] to be something that longs for that it's
[1:09:19] something on the inside of a man that
[1:09:21] makes that that wants him to have have a
[1:09:24] wife it's something on the inside of
[1:09:25] that girl you watch that little girl
[1:09:28] doesn't matter if she's 2 years old
[1:09:30] she's got something on the inside of her
[1:09:33] that she's got to Mother them little
[1:09:34] baby dolls it's amazing thing it's
[1:09:37] something that maybe maybe she grew up
[1:09:40] in a home that didn't have a mother but
[1:09:42] it's something that God put on that
[1:09:44] inside of that little girl that she's
[1:09:46] got a mother something and she can take
[1:09:48] that little baby doll and it's something
[1:09:51] laying there and it's got to be made
[1:09:54] manifest so she takes a baby do but
[1:09:57] today we live in a world where people
[1:09:59] want to take dogs and take cats and
[1:10:00] mother them instead of having children
[1:10:02] in this
[1:10:05] hour but you see the reason why you want
[1:10:08] children is because God put something on
[1:10:11] the inside of you to make you long to
[1:10:13] have children the reason why you long
[1:10:16] for the Holy Ghost is because God put
[1:10:18] something on the inside of you that
[1:10:20] would make you expect the Holy Ghost all
[1:10:23] right am I preaching to you now a reason
[1:10:26] why that you are wanting a body change
[1:10:29] is because God told you about
[1:10:32] it hallelujah it's like a kid on
[1:10:38] Christmas they would think it's just
[1:10:40] another day but you told him it was
[1:10:42] different you told him there was
[1:10:43] something different about Christmas
[1:10:44] didn't you you told him that on that day
[1:10:47] that you took some time out of your life
[1:10:49] to go out there and buy something that
[1:10:51] you thought that they would like and
[1:10:53] they know that there's something waiting
[1:10:55] on
[1:10:57] them Hallelujah there's something
[1:11:00] waiting on
[1:11:01] them I tell you it's something about the
[1:11:04] on the inside of a kid when Mama and
[1:11:07] Daddy ain't around they want to go
[1:11:08] around
[1:11:09] there and they want to shake that
[1:11:12] box they want to find out what's on the
[1:11:15] inside of and I know good and well
[1:11:16] there's a whole bunch of kids sitting in
[1:11:18] them 50y old men out
[1:11:21] there Mama's away
[1:11:29] yes Milwaukee new drill praise
[1:11:33] God the inside of that little child when
[1:11:36] they begin to look at those things they
[1:11:38] look at the shape of the Box they begin
[1:11:40] to think about it they shake it they get
[1:11:42] the sound of
[1:11:44] it and they lay there all night long
[1:11:47] thinking about what's in that
[1:11:51] box Mama never could wrap wrap a
[1:11:53] basketball up too
[1:11:57] good but I always knew when there was a
[1:12:00] basketball wrapped up and I'd lay there
[1:12:03] thinking I was playing for Roy
[1:12:06] Williams part of the tar Hills man alive
[1:12:09] I was something else in my
[1:12:11] dreams but I was born a Spencer and I
[1:12:14] couldn't hardly get off the ground so
[1:12:17] the tar Hills never got to my
[1:12:19] expectation but in my dream I was
[1:12:21] expecting them to call me
[1:12:25] what happened Mama wrapped up a
[1:12:27] basketball and it made me think it made
[1:12:30] me dream it made me expect that in the
[1:12:32] morning I'm going to unwrap that thing
[1:12:35] they would sometimes unwrapped things
[1:12:37] and I didn't get what I thought I was
[1:12:42] getting sometimes I open up praise God
[1:12:45] moving on
[1:12:47] H but there something there on the
[1:12:49] inside of that little
[1:12:51] child it's just like you
[1:12:54] you've been told there's a body change
[1:12:57] coming you've been told that there's a
[1:12:59] Rapture coming you've been told that
[1:13:01] there's healing coming you've been told
[1:13:03] that there's Deliverance coming and I'll
[1:13:05] be honest I've been up shaking the Box a
[1:13:07] little bit every been sometimes when I
[1:13:10] wake up at 2:00 3:00 in the morning and
[1:13:12] I get to Shake in the box and I begin to
[1:13:14] think about it is it right for me to
[1:13:16] expect brother Ron's healing is it right
[1:13:18] for me to express brother Donnie's
[1:13:20] healing is it right is it right is it
[1:13:23] right
[1:13:23] for me to expect a body change is it
[1:13:26] right and I shake the box and I find
[1:13:30] that when I open up the seals and find
[1:13:34] out it's like a kid on Christmas morning
[1:13:37] you got what you expected for let me
[1:13:40] tell you Church of the Living God the
[1:13:42] seals have been rolled off of it you're
[1:13:45] going to match what your expectation
[1:13:48] is the reason why job wanted to say to
[1:13:52] know God God is was because God asked
[1:13:55] him do you know me do you know me
[1:14:01] job the reason why you're expecting
[1:14:04] these things is because it's been long
[1:14:06] prophesied that there's going to be a
[1:14:09] body there's going to be a change
[1:14:11] there's going to be a woman that's bone
[1:14:13] of his bone life of his life she's
[1:14:15] sinless she's virtuous she's watched in
[1:14:17] his
[1:14:20] blood what is it it's a strong
[1:14:24] desire it's a strong desire and it makes
[1:14:27] you persevere what will desire do it'll
[1:14:30] bring you a
[1:14:32] Revival that's what the Bible said that
[1:14:34] hope is or faith is Faith is the
[1:14:37] substance of things hoped for it's the
[1:14:39] evidence of Things Not Seen when the
[1:14:41] Bible told us in Romans chapter 4:18 who
[1:14:44] against hope believed in hope that he
[1:14:47] might become the father of many nations
[1:14:49] according to that which was spoken so
[1:14:51] shall th see be and be and not weak in
[1:14:54] faith he considered not his own body now
[1:14:56] dead when he was about a 100 years old
[1:14:58] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
[1:15:01] womb consider not your consider not your
[1:15:04] weak body consider not your frails
[1:15:07] consider not all your failures and your
[1:15:10] mistakes come on somebody consider not
[1:15:13] the problems that are stacked up against
[1:15:15] you consider it not
[1:15:17] Abraham but against hope when it looked
[1:15:20] hopeless his belief was not in vain your
[1:15:23] faith is not in
[1:15:27] vain
[1:15:30] hallelujah it's like a lot of people
[1:15:33] many of you taking trips you begin to
[1:15:35] plan out that

[1:15:53] like that you're going to get there and
[1:15:55] things are going to be all scrupled up
[1:15:57] but when a person spends all those time
[1:15:59] all that time they they spend countless
[1:16:02] hours searching out the destination that
[1:16:04] they're going to they the plans have
[1:16:06] been made the countless hours of

[1:16:27] waiting for it you're in the Fulfillment
[1:16:30] of your
[1:16:34] plans and a lot of times you get more

[1:16:46] been on them trips you planed everything

[1:18:21] heard him say he said that that prodal
[1:18:24] had long been waiting had long been
[1:18:27] waiting to come to himself and he said I
[1:18:29] watch him come to himself and he said he
[1:18:33] started singing tell my mother I'll be
[1:18:37] there Hallelujah it was something on the
[1:18:40] inside of him that reminded him that he
[1:18:43] was a son to begin
[1:18:45] with but a lot of times people get their
[1:18:49] eyes on the wrong
[1:18:51] prodal
[1:18:55] the other brother because he was jealous
[1:18:59] because he was jealous because his
[1:19:01] because his brother had spent all of his
[1:19:03] living out there with with all kinds of
[1:19:05] women spending out there doing drugs
[1:19:07] spending out there but he looked up him
[1:19:10] and scorned him because his daddy
[1:19:13] received him as a son when he didn't
[1:19:15] even act like a son he was just as much
[1:19:18] as prodal as that boy was out there
[1:19:23] blessed be the name of the Lord let me
[1:19:25] tell you something don't you miss don't

[1:19:33] house of God I was out there let me tell
[1:19:36] you the reason why you're a son is
[1:19:38] because he thought of you he deposited
[1:19:41] something on the inside of you blessed
[1:19:44] be the name of the Lord and something
[1:19:47] guided him back
[1:19:50] home it's the same thing that gued you
[1:19:52] home
[1:19:53] home it's the same thing that led you
[1:19:55] home it was an angel William Bram said
[1:19:57] an angel went there and tapped him on
[1:19:59] the side and said it's time to go home
[1:20:02] son what made the other prodal change
[1:20:05] his heart the same
[1:20:07] Angel what made you change your tune and
[1:20:10] you were sitting here and you are

[1:20:34] Afflicted because of your worship and
[1:20:37] they don't understand what is going on
[1:20:39] they don't fully understand what's
[1:20:42] happening and they're setting in the
[1:20:43] seat of the
[1:20:45] prodal but oh if you could just W wake
[1:20:49] up that angel if you could just bump
[1:20:51] into that angel one time if you could be
[1:20:54] like Peter and John down there on the
[1:20:56] inside of that jail or Paul and Silas
[1:20:57] down in that jail and start worshiping
[1:20:59] God the way that you were built to
[1:21:01] worship that when they begin to worship
[1:21:04] all the chains of everybody in that jail
[1:21:07] cell were loose at the worshiping when
[1:21:11] they begin to sing songs and hymns unto
[1:21:14] almighty God and what is happening when
[1:21:17] brother Jordan breaks into an atmosphere
[1:21:20] and channels the Holy Ghost he's bump
[1:21:22] into an
[1:21:24] angel what happens sis when sister
[1:21:26] Rachel hits another octave she's bumped
[1:21:29] into an angel what
[1:21:32] happens what is it that angel is working
[1:21:35] the building it's working the building
[1:21:37] looking for everyone of
[1:21:41] you
[1:21:43] Hallelujah that God that God was there
[1:21:48] by an Angel and led him back
[1:21:50] home my brother B said brother bar said
[1:21:53] you were birth here your birth here was
[1:21:56] pre-planned I guess you believe that
[1:21:59] that every one of you knows that our
[1:22:00] birth was pre-planned you do know that
[1:22:02] your being here never originated just as
[1:22:05] a myth or a thought everything was all
[1:22:07] pre-planned by almighty God if you're
[1:22:10] ever going to take a trip you're going
[1:22:11] to have to have somebody that's going to
[1:22:14] be your guide somebody that's going to
[1:22:16] lead
[1:22:17] you brother random would tell us in the
[1:22:19] message of God he said now a God has to
[1:22:21] know the way he has to know where he's
[1:22:23] going or what he's doing and how to take
[1:22:25] care of you along the road you see if
[1:22:28] you brother random said if you don't
[1:22:30] have a God you got a 1% chance to make
[1:22:32] it back on your own you got 1% chance to
[1:22:36] make it back on your own but that God
[1:22:38] has been certified if you're hunting
[1:22:41] he's been certified by the state to go
[1:22:43] out there and look out where you are
[1:22:46] going and he knows that if you get lost
[1:22:49] he can find his way to you because he
[1:22:51] studied out Le otsy
[1:22:53] he study out the road maps down here in
[1:22:55] Elon and down here in Gros and he knows
[1:22:57] where you're at he knows when you get on
[1:23:00] them Crossroads and he don't know which
[1:23:02] way to take so the GU will come there
[1:23:04] and lead
[1:23:05] you that's what William bam said in
[1:23:08] leadership he said you from your very
[1:23:10] first birth you were led by your parents
[1:23:13] he said when you die you're going to be
[1:23:14] led by somebody so somebody's got to
[1:23:16] lead you so if you're going to go on a
[1:23:19] trip then somebody's got to lead you is
[1:23:21] that right
[1:23:23] you see because if you don't make his
[1:23:24] preparations and you're figuring on
[1:23:26] taking a trip where you haven't been
[1:23:29] before you might just come up lost you
[1:23:31] remember when William Brandon preaches
[1:23:33] that thought he preaches that thought
[1:23:35] that there's a daddy that's wanting to
[1:23:37] take his that take his son and he'd been
[1:23:39] reading in a magazine about these
[1:23:41] hunting trips he didn't really know what
[1:23:42] he was doing but he took his son all the
[1:23:43] way up on the mountains and he got up
[1:23:46] here and he froze to death and that boy
[1:23:49] lost his life because that Daddy didn't
[1:23:51] take the right precaution
[1:23:53] and I believe that too many people have
[1:23:55] climbed the thought of unbelief thinking
[1:23:58] that they were going in the right way
[1:23:59] but they should have took a guide with
[1:24:01] him brother bandam said if that man
[1:24:03] would have studied he would have saved
[1:24:04] his son's
[1:24:05] life you see you got to have a God and
[1:24:08] you might think that you're well
[1:24:10] qualified to do it all on your own you
[1:24:12] remember William brandham thought he was
[1:24:14] he was well qualified and he got himself
[1:24:16] on that Indian on that Indian crosswalk
[1:24:19] and he got himself good and lost but
[1:24:21] there was somebody that W up there and
[1:24:23] tapped him on the shoulder said I'm a
[1:24:25] everpresent help in the time of trouble
[1:24:28] what is he he's Jehovah shama when
[1:24:31] you're in trouble that means the Lord is
[1:24:35] there when does Jehovah Gyra show up
[1:24:38] when does Jehovah nii show up when does
[1:24:40] Jehovah Shalom show up when does Jehovah
[1:24:43] tianu show
[1:24:44] up in the middle of your chaos he could
[1:24:49] have never declared himself as Jehovah
[1:24:51] Gyra unless Abraham was in need of
[1:24:55] providing of a lamb he could have never
[1:24:57] showed himself as Jehovah Rafa unless
[1:25:00] you got
[1:25:01] sick he could have never showed himself
[1:25:04] as the guide unless you'd have been
[1:25:08] lost and I've said this a thousand times
[1:25:11] but I'm going to say it a thousand one
[1:25:12] times you say well brother Andrew I'm
[1:25:14] listening to you on the internet and I'm
[1:25:15] as lost as lost can be
[1:25:18] good cuz that means you can be found
[1:25:23] the first the first state of it is
[1:25:26] recognizing that you're lost William
[1:25:28] Brenham thought he had everything
[1:25:29] figured out but there was something that
[1:25:32] he was waiting on down there at the end
[1:25:35] of that
[1:25:37] mountain well was it it was everything
[1:25:39] that he longed for everything that he
[1:25:41] loved everything that he held dear in
[1:25:43] life his mother his wife and his son out
[1:25:46] there but his
[1:25:48] own his own Consciousness got him in
[1:25:51] this mess up there on that death walk
[1:25:54] but he had his hands in the
[1:25:56] air he was looking for a line he was
[1:25:59] looking for a line because he'd been up
[1:26:01] there before he'd been up there before
[1:26:03] with an Ranger and told him and they put
[1:26:05] that line up there and he knew that if
[1:26:07] he could ever get a hold of that line it
[1:26:09] would lead him back to his wife it would
[1:26:11] lead him back to his son and you've been
[1:26:13] here before you've sat in services like
[1:26:16] this before you've heard preaching like
[1:26:18] this before you walk this line before
[1:26:20] but if you can just lift up your
[1:26:22] hands everything that you've been
[1:26:25] waiting on is at the end of this
[1:26:28] line you said well I don't know how much
[1:26:30] more I can go let me tell you when you
[1:26:31] running out of rope my God will throw
[1:26:33] you a line come on somebody William
[1:26:36] brandom said I thought I had it when I
[1:26:38] grabbed a hold of self of a limb he said
[1:26:40] but I found out it was a false religion
[1:26:42] and you may have thought you got
[1:26:44] yourself something when you was down at
[1:26:45] the altar one night but you found
[1:26:47] yourself out there living with somebody
[1:26:50] else's wife you got got a hold of
[1:26:52] somebody's false religion but when you
[1:26:55] got a hold of the message you knew it
[1:26:57] was going to lead you right back to
[1:27:04] Jesus what is it what is it we recognize
[1:27:08] where we are the planning of God has led
[1:27:10] us here everything that we've waited for
[1:27:12] everything that we've longed for when
[1:27:14] you go to reading in Exodus chapter 12
[1:27:17] when there they had seen all of these
[1:27:19] Messiah signs they' seen all the
[1:27:21] manifestation of the son of man working
[1:27:23] through Moses what was it the son of man
[1:27:26] made an invasion down in
[1:27:29] Egypt he worked his way down into Egypt
[1:27:32] and he showed
[1:27:34] himself but he told him go get yourself
[1:27:37] a lamb go get yourself a lamb keep him
[1:27:41] 14 days he's got to be without blemish
[1:27:43] he's got to be perfect why is he got to
[1:27:45] be perfect he's got to be perfect for
[1:27:49] you what was it it was a perfect type of
[1:27:51] Christ and when they kept him up they
[1:27:54] couldn't y they had to they had to kill
[1:27:56] it out they had to take the blood and
[1:27:57] place it across the door it was a
[1:28:00] perfect cross what was he applying it by
[1:28:02] my hiss up perfect Faith laying out
[1:28:05] there crossing over the door showing
[1:28:08] that death could not come to where this
[1:28:10] lamb was and when they were standing
[1:28:13] there when they were standing there on
[1:28:15] that side of the blood they recognized
[1:28:18] that death could not get to them ain't
[1:28:20] it a wonderful thing tonight know
[1:28:22] brother Jim that death can't get to you
[1:28:25] because the lamb is there don't you know
[1:28:27] that when John was standing there when
[1:28:30] John was standing there and they were
[1:28:31] musing in their hearts is this him or is
[1:28:35] this not him is this Messiah or is this
[1:28:37] not the Messiah but John said I must
[1:28:40] decrease so that he can increase what
[1:28:44] was John pointing to I'm not the Messiah
[1:28:47] but I'm pointing you to a
[1:28:49] messiah what was he doing what was it
[1:28:53] the Bible said that they expected it
[1:28:56] they expected the Messiah there was a
[1:28:59] heart's desire in the hour for the
[1:29:01] Messiah to show up and John was
[1:29:04] preaching such a Ministry that it looked
[1:29:07] so much like him that the people mused
[1:29:10] in their hearts is this
[1:29:13] him is this him you watch
[1:29:17] it it correlates perfectly with the
[1:29:21] Forerunner of this age as John the
[1:29:23] Baptist was first was the first
[1:29:25] Forerunner so will your message William
[1:29:27] brandham forun the second coming of all
[1:29:29] of Christ what was it it was a perfect
[1:29:33] overlay it was a
[1:29:34] forerunning but you watch as people
[1:29:37] mused in our hearts is this him is this
[1:29:41] his second coming they they got
[1:29:43] confused they thought it was Christ in
[1:29:46] brandham what was it they saw so much
[1:29:49] God in William brandham they thought
[1:29:52] they thought John was the Christ they
[1:29:54] thought William brandham was the Christ
[1:29:56] but William brandham said you keep on
[1:29:58] preaching I'm not the Christ I'm just a
[1:30:01] signpost to you he said it wasn't me
[1:30:04] down there on the Ohio River down there
[1:30:06] he said I was only near when he showed
[1:30:10] up what he tell to you he said what are
[1:30:12] you doing you're not feeding on the mind
[1:30:14] of a man you're feeding on the unfailing
[1:30:16] body word of the son of man it wasn't me
[1:30:20] it wasn't the seventh angel it was a
[1:30:22] mighty
[1:30:24] Angel what was it when he's standing
[1:30:27] there in the Ohio River baptizing 500
[1:30:30] people and the 17th person as he's
[1:30:33] baptizing them a Mystic star shows over
[1:30:36] top of William brandham and a voice
[1:30:39] cries
[1:30:41] out as John the Baptist was for was the
[1:30:44] first of four run the first coming of
[1:30:45] Christ so will your message it was seen
[1:30:48] all the way in Canada all the way in the
[1:30:50] newspapers it was car carried up there
[1:30:52] what was
[1:30:54] it it was a sign it was a sign that this
[1:30:58] is the hour that this is the moment this
[1:30:59] is the time that I'm coming for a people
[1:31:02] it was a sign to this generation that
[1:31:05] God was gathering a people for his
[1:31:08] name's sake it had long been waited on
[1:31:11] and what did this messenger do just like
[1:31:14] John did he went into the Unseen World
[1:31:17] and he brought back Hidden Truths he
[1:31:20] went in there and he went into the those
[1:31:22] things and he brought them back here so
[1:31:24] that you could understand
[1:31:26] it my grandmother Nancy told me when I
[1:31:29] was just a when I was just a a young
[1:31:31] Christian she told me she said I fully
[1:31:34] didn't understand the Bible I read it
[1:31:36] every day she said but when the message
[1:31:38] came by our way she said I begin to see
[1:31:41] the Bible in a new
[1:31:43] light how many can identify themselves
[1:31:46] with that you couldn't understand what
[1:31:48] Revelations was you couldn't understand
[1:31:51] what the scripture said in there but God
[1:31:53] sent a prophet to you to tell you what
[1:31:56] these things are and to the
[1:31:58] denominations they're still closed off
[1:32:02] but to
[1:32:03] you I want you to think about this you
[1:32:06] look out there on them denominations and
[1:32:07] I'm not making lie of them but you look
[1:32:09] out
[1:32:10] there you look out there and you see the
[1:32:13] manifestations of powers of of Joy
[1:32:15] shouts coming upon Pentecostals and
[1:32:18] people demonstrating powers of casting
[1:32:20] out demons and and cancer leaving bodies
[1:32:24] and they're doing that with Loose Ends
[1:32:27] what ought this body ought to be doing
[1:32:30] with every loose end tied up together
[1:32:33] what ought this to do the things that we
[1:32:36] waited for they're
[1:32:38] here the tokens in hand the lamb has
[1:32:41] been killed don't eat it wrong kill the
[1:32:44] lamb I burn it with fire eat the lamb
[1:32:47] John take the whole book eat the whole
[1:32:50] book come on I'm preaching you the
[1:32:54] message today what did William Bram do
[1:32:56] he said John was sent there to wind up
[1:32:58] those loose ends he said but in this age
[1:33:01] and he goes in there and he tells us
[1:33:03] that time shall be no more and he goes
[1:33:05] into Revelations chapter 10 and he
[1:33:08] preaches a message to us sir is this the
[1:33:12] sign of the
[1:33:13] end and he said are we at the
[1:33:17] end where are we
[1:33:19] at could this be he said could this be
[1:33:22] the thing that puts us into rapturing
[1:33:24] Faith he said could this be the thing
[1:33:26] that makes us jump up and leap over a
[1:33:28] wall he said could this be the
[1:33:31] thing what was the messenger doing he
[1:33:35] was Awakening our
[1:33:38] expectation for the manifestations of
[1:33:41] sons of God to think that we were living
[1:33:43] in an hour we were so close that William
[1:33:46] R said we probed at it we looked at
[1:33:50] it what was it when John stood there in
[1:33:54] Matthew chap 11 and Jesus is having
[1:33:56] himself a preaching Revival he's having
[1:33:58] a healing Revival and John starts
[1:34:01] hearing about these things and brother
[1:34:03] Rand said that John's Eagle Eye got
[1:34:04] filmed over and he said and he sent some
[1:34:08] of his disciples down there said now
[1:34:09] look go ask him are you the one that
[1:34:12] we're looking for are you the one we're
[1:34:14] looking for and you go to look up that
[1:34:16] word in Matthew 11 and3 I believe it's
[1:34:18] are you the one that we're looking for
[1:34:20] when you look up that word look it means
[1:34:22] are you the one that we're
[1:34:24] expecting but his Eagle eyed got filmed
[1:34:27] over because when he's standing there on
[1:34:29] the banks of Jordan and he's baptizing
[1:34:31] Jesus he said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:34:34] that takes away the sin of the world
[1:34:37] what was it he got up there and he got
[1:34:39] in prison but brother random said that
[1:34:42] Jesus didn't send him some book how to
[1:34:44] be happy down there in jail he said John
[1:34:46] just take a look at what's happening
[1:34:48] down here in Elton just take a look at
[1:34:50] what's going on the blind are being
[1:34:52] healed the blind are receiving their
[1:34:54] sight the sick are being healed John I
[1:34:57] am perfectly on schedule everything's
[1:34:59] right in
[1:35:01] line what was it Jesus was showing that
[1:35:05] the increase had came what is it in your
[1:35:08] hour when you start seeing the
[1:35:11] manifestations of sons of God it's Jesus
[1:35:14] showing the
[1:35:16] increase hallelujah it's Jesus showing
[1:35:20] the increase
[1:35:24] when they were looking when they were
[1:35:26] looking for one he came looking for
[1:35:30] them I I just want to I'm not going to
[1:35:33] get finished with this
[1:35:35] song but I I want to read you this and
[1:35:38] we'll probably come to a close here
[1:35:41] brother brand said I was reading a story
[1:35:43] some years ago and he said in this story
[1:35:45] he said a great Noble King he said if I
[1:35:47] forget his name he said just now he said
[1:35:48] I wasn't thinking about speaking of the
[1:35:50] story he said perhaps perhaps it's
[1:35:51] fiction he said but it leads us to a
[1:35:54] point that gives us a background on what
[1:35:56] we want to say he said this King he was
[1:35:59] such a noble King and such a great lover
[1:36:01] of his subjects till one day before his
[1:36:04] guards and his royalty he said today you
[1:36:07] see me for your last for many
[1:36:10] years and his guards and his Nobles said
[1:36:12] to him good King why why you say that
[1:36:16] are you going to a foreign country
[1:36:17] somewhere and become an alien he said no
[1:36:19] I'm staying right here well I I'm going
[1:36:22] out amongst my subjects I'm going to be
[1:36:24] become a peasant I'm going to cut wood
[1:36:26] with a wood Chopper I'm going to teal
[1:36:28] ground with a toiler I'm going to prune
[1:36:30] vines with those who prune Vines I'm
[1:36:32] going to be one of them in order to get
[1:36:34] a better acquainted with what they're
[1:36:36] doing I love them and I want to be more
[1:36:39] acquainted with them personally and I
[1:36:41] they won't know me but yet I want to be
[1:36:44] acquainted with them in that way and the
[1:36:47] next morning when his delegates and all
[1:36:49] of his people seen him were the ones
[1:36:51] that was was in the palace take off of
[1:36:53] his crown and lay it down upon the seed
[1:36:54] in his throne and take his robe off and
[1:36:57] put on peasants clothes and walk out
[1:36:58] amongst the common people he said in
[1:37:00] that little story he said we find out
[1:37:02] then about God that said to the king
[1:37:05] said King we want you we love you we
[1:37:08] want you to remain King but he wanted to
[1:37:12] become one of them to know them better
[1:37:15] that they would know him better really
[1:37:17] what he was it would display to them
[1:37:21] what what he really was and he said
[1:37:23] that's what God did he changed himself
[1:37:26] from being Jehovah God to become one of
[1:37:28] us that he might suffer that he might
[1:37:31] taste death that he might know what the
[1:37:33] sting of death was and take the penalty
[1:37:35] of death upon himself and he laid aside
[1:37:38] his crown and his robe and became one of
[1:37:40] us he washed feet with the lowely he
[1:37:44] dwelt in tents with poor he slept in the
[1:37:47] woods and the streets and those who were
[1:37:50] under privileged
[1:37:52] he became one of us that he might
[1:37:56] understand us better that we might
[1:37:59] understand him
[1:38:03] better to think that all of these
[1:38:08] prophecies you're getting ready to see
[1:38:10] the results of
[1:38:12] it all of these Visions that's been
[1:38:14] manifested Isaiah Ezekiel all of these
[1:38:17] things are laying
[1:38:19] there and now he wants to become one of
[1:38:22] you so he leaves the portals of
[1:38:25] Heaven this has been long waited

[1:42:38] picked me up 20 years before I got in my
[1:42:40] situations of life but God had me going
[1:42:43] through what I was going through for
[1:42:45] this brother or for that
[1:42:49] sister because it was going to be a
[1:42:51] testimony to you that God Saves the
[1:42:56] worst of Sinners I heard Prophet sa when
[1:42:59] he was talking about the woman at the
[1:43:00] woman at the wh he said there was
[1:43:02] something on the inside of her that he
[1:43:04] saw that was redeemable that's why he
[1:43:06] went up there that's why I sat down at
[1:43:09] the well she'd been looking for the
[1:43:11] right kind of a man she'd been guided to
[1:43:14] the wrong spots all of her life but this
[1:43:18] day the one that saw fit
[1:43:21] to redeem all of
[1:43:23] her he didn't just want her body he
[1:43:26] wanted her
[1:43:27] soul he saw something that was
[1:43:29] redeemable on the inside of her she'd
[1:43:32] been waiting for it she'd been looking
[1:43:34] for it I want you to know that the one
[1:43:36] that you've been waiting for is in the
