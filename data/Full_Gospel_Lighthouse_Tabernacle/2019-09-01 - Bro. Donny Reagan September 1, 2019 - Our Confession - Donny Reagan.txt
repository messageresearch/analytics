that let's do that where we don't have to go home let's just go ahead and do that for eternities that that sound like a good deal hallelujah amen well I I can't say that it could possibly get any better cuz it was it's just been out of this world I I just like to say thank you so much for coming you many of you have driven so many miles to come and left so many situations and I can truly say it's been worth a trip it's been worth a trip I'd like to thank you for coming and uh you still got you still still got one great big let's see Porter House left here and uh and so we just you know I just thank the Lord for everything that he's done every Miracle that's happened we we've had so many testimonies already come in and uh God's just so good to us thank you thank you so much uh today we've we've got some things provided for you after service today so you don't have to be in no great big hurry and so I I just want to spend eternity with you if that'll be that'll be okay just so honored to have had brother Wayne brother Timothy brother Tim last night to me that's the best sermon I've ever heard brother Tim preach that was just out of [Music] [Music] this Hallelujah you know I think about about 12 years ago it was right after this Labor Day meeting the next face that I would recognize would be him and uh I would call him my buddy and he's still my buddy and uh the fellow that's getting ready to speak calls him his little buddy and uh and so we we're certainly privileged to stand with generals God bless the men of God that blessed thank you so much again for being here and uh we so love you with all of our hearts maybe we could sing at course again as we invite brother Donnie to come and speak you know that you pull on the gift of God Amen many of you sit here since 9:00 this morning so you're ready you're ready I like to preach to a ready congregation amen let's let's just sing that one more time as we invite brother Donnie to speak to us today God bless you as you receive the word today and he said that I would still go free oh tell me what kind of a man would reach down his hand and do this for [Music] me oh un worthy to live and not F to kill let a man all the cross my name is is that [Applause] [Music] I [Music] praise the Lord what a wonderful thing it is to be free today God bless you let's turn if you would in the scripture to the little book of fiman chapter just one chapter there verse five what a privilege it's been to be together in these days and these Services I guess the sad part about it is always when we have to say goodbye we have to go our separate ways and things that'll we be facing after these wonderful meetings U it's h want to be with brother Wayne brother Tim my friend brother Ron different ministers and Saints different church that are represented trust the Lord Jesus will help us today and I know that you've been here for a long time this morning so I'll try not to be too long um this is quite a quite a book it's a little book only one chapter um unlike many of the other New Testament books that were named of course Matthew Martin Luke and John book of Acts Corinthians Philippians U named after different cities named after Apostles but this book Bears the name of just a lay member right and this man is not a preacher uh as far as historically no record that he ever became a preacher but he was a a Christian a man filled with the Holy Ghost a good brother that loved God and really had some outstanding things about his character so let us read if you would U begin reading in verse five hearing of thy love and faith which thou H has toward the lord Jesus and toward All Saints that the communication of thy faith may become effectual now this word effectual means powerful active energetic and perfected in full knowledge that the communication of thy faith the word communication is coia which means the sharing of your faith so this this brother God had done done something for him he's a real real example of Christianity and he was sharing what God had done for him but Paul wanted something else to happen in this brother's life that the communication of thy faith may become now he's growing so he wants him to become effectual so faith can actually become more effectual more energized we don't want intellectual Faith certainly not notice he says that it may become effectual so how does faith become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus so it's not just having it it's not just believing it but it's actually acknowledging it now listen this brother in verse 7 for we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the bowels of the Saints now you may know this read in the New Testament that in the this first century time that they viewed the bowels as being the emotion the very heart you know the way you felt things your spirit what we would say today in our spirit the bows of the Saints are refreshed by thee brother so this indicates to us that fimon was the type of a Christian that was a refreshing sort of a Christian now we've all been around Christians like that haven't we that were refreshing to be around and they were enjoyable and we've been around others that were the other way they're not near as much fun and they're not near as exciting and you know you just feel all washed out when you leave them right oh wouldn't it be wonderful if every one of us us to leave this meeting being this type of a person right here the bowels of the Saints are refreshed by the brother now the church at colassi actually most of you know that there was no church buildings in the 1 and 2 Century even up to about 300 years before the Catholic Church would actually started building temples and Tabernacles and so on but the churches many of them were in buildings public houses and they were also in people's homes now there very little we know about this guy except that he was a a businessman sort of a wealthy type of a man but the church at coloss so actually to there and this church was actually in this man's house him and his wife and their son which Paul mentioned now notice whenever something about this brother is so outstanding that the word the word of that day was living out of his life but Paul wanted it to be greater an achievement by him being able to recognize all that God had done in him let's read also in Philippians chapter 4:8 finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure which eliminates most of the apps that we have on our phones basically all your news things are all fake news it ain't just see an end or all right our our minds are filled with so much nonsense and so much negativity whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on the these things let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father we have had a wonderful time in your presence it's been so good to be able to set under the atmosphere that we've had here Lord from the very first service it was so charged with expectation Lord I just walking in the building the first night and it just felt like there was such a pressure but it wasn't a bad pressure it was just a charge of an atmosphere of the saints of God thank you Lord in this last day in this time of evil and darkness there are children that still love to come to the house of God and they don't come with a dread they do not come with drudgery but they come with such Heavenly anticipation Lord we thank you for that last night so powerful thank you Lord Jesus once again here we come father to the final service of these meetings and with sadness we come to the last service but yet also with anticipation knowing that one day we will say our last a amen we will say our last goodbyes and we'll never have to separate again so we desire today father that while we are gathered here I understand that they've been here for quite some time so I pray that you'd make me mindful of that but Lord while we're here we know the value of going to be placed on the word of God I want to bring something to them today that they can take wiom Lord when they Journey down the road today tomorrow whenever they head home something that will be a benefit to them Lord Jesus we pray that the word of God will speak today help me to be an oracle help me to get out of the way shut my mouth to anything that would be displeasing to you I Surrender myself Lord Jesus and I pray that you'd anoint me but anoint them as well that we can receive from you today in the name of Jesus Christ and the Saints said amen amen God bless you may be seated I'd like to speak to you today for just a bit on uh our confession now we know we're living in an age when uh so many preachers and Leo deia have went through the name it claim it plan and uh you know you want a BMW just claim it you want to Cadillac just claim it and that's that's not at all of course what we believe that God has instituted for his children but I do believe that they have broken into a principle of God's truth that is absolutely right but yet we know Satan always uses scarecrows and they should scare crows and not scare us so the truth of God's word is that we want to be able to take every aspect I thought brother Tim brought it out so beautifully last night of every part of the Lamb the head the legs the pertinence thereof so there's parts that's more tasty than others and if ever true preacher would be honest he would let you know today there's certain things he'd rather preach than other things a that right brother so that's just the way that the word of God comes but we know that there is a truth in the words that we speak our words have great power not only our words but the words of politicians the words of people no doubt we are sitting here today being influenced by the atmosphere that we were in our home if you were raised with a lot of negativity and you were raised being told that you would never amount to any say and you'd never be anything and all of that no doubt a lot of that has impacted you to this very day and as brother Tim again brought it out last night that God wants to change our spirit from our spirit imagination conscience memory reason and affection it was the second realm of us that God gave us in a substitute for the theophany one day the spirit will break up when we die and we get the word form bed the theophany that we should have had in the first place but until that time we're stuck with this human Spirit like it or not so so God helps us to be able to um become Born Again In the soul but the spirit's not born again the flesh is not born again but God wants it to be subject to the nature that's living inside of us and we're living in a very negative world are we not every day you know all your news all your apps all we've got all these things years and years ago if an earthquake would have happened somewhere around the world and 5,000 people would have died 150 years ago people living in the United States if it happened in Afghanistan they might have heard it 50 years after it happened they might have heard it if they ever did hear it and that's that's not just so many years ago as it would have been also on the days of our parents but in the days now that we have television radio then we move up where we have apps and news notifications and all this and our minds our Spirits our constant Humanity all the time is being flooded over with so many negative things so much sickness politics politics saying this and that and the other negativity and you you know what we're living in such a great age with so many positive things to look at in the word of God I believe we ought to feed more on those things than we shut on all those negative things we'll never change all of that but what we can do is change our diet and change the things that we think about now I'm going to I'm going to read a few scriptures with you write them down if you like Psalms 19:14 let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my strength and my redeemer Psalms 1413 set a watch oh Lord before my mouth and keep the door of my lips now I wonder why we would need a watch over our mouths and something to prohibit an outgo or an income of the door of our lips unless there is power in our words Proverbs 6:2 thou art snared with the words of thy mouth Thou Art taken and that word is a similar word that they would use to catch foul and you Thou Art taken with the words of thy mouth Proverbs 13:3 he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life well praise the Lord he that now let me just tell you up front this is not going to be deep don't worry I'm not going to just you know you going to really have to concentrate and really no it's going to be right down where we all live where we all walk all that sort of things so you don't have to worry about no deep things I'm not that type preacher no way he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life but he that openest wide his lips shall have destruction you mean simply just from talking and simply from saying certain things that we will open open our mouth I'm not a very good Christian God don't love me I'm I'm no count I'm rotten you're talking the devil's language when you're saying that people think you got to be cussing and got to saying all kinds of things like that to talk the devil's language oh no the devil has a Sanctified language for church folks and they don't use curse words that don't use in things come on now but he uses scriptures he uses message quotes that's right notice and Proverbs 15:4 a wholesome tongue is a tree of life a wholesome tongue is a tree of life and the word wholesome there means health and healing so a healthy tongue wow a healthy tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit Proverbs 18:21 death and life are in the power not of the Soul not of the spirit but in the power of the tongue death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof Matthew 12:37 for by thy words Thou shalt be justified ified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned and the Saints said now watch brother brandham now pick up the exact same thought and that Thy word he said talking about people being called in the prayer line now if your numberers called tonight in the prayer line if God reveals your heart and speaks to you and gives you Deliverance here don't you never have no kind of a testimony only that he healed you because if you do if you one time testify to the other side the negative side it will come back on you worse than it was before now we know how it is in special meetings when anointed Servants of God pray for us and they they're able to unite their faith with our faith and bring you know something Supernatural and special I appreciate that myself don't you but yet we know that that us keeping that Deliverance will not be based upon constant contact with that servant of God and calling him and texting him and emailing him but it will be our constant faith in what God said that the God who delivered me will keep me delivered and The God Who healed me will keep me healed and the God who saved me will keep me saved but a lot of it has to do with the way that we look at it can you imagine brother bam telling the people that the very God who heals them would be able to keep it away as long as their testimony was positive that I am healed well praise the Lord notice again he says let him that's weak say I am strong just say in your heart that I am now strong I have now accepted Jesus as my healer never have a negative testimony anymore but I'm going to tell that was hard in 1953 when he said that but it's a lot harder now than it was then there's Pro there's probably not a family here in this place today that have all kinds of trauma we have all kinds of family issues we have church issues we have job issues we've got mental issues psychological issues money issues car issues truck issues kid issues dog issues cat issues house issues rent issues ownership ship issues we've got issues and if we're not careful all of those things will occupy our mind and we're so defeated and we go to the house of God and the preacher has to spend the first half of his sermon and raising us up high enough to even be able to receive something from God oh my notice this now you imagine this is 1951 when he said this never have a negative testimony anymore just believe it God is under obligation Jesus Christ setting on the right hand of the Throne of God he said to accept you he's sitting there is the high priest of your confession to make good before the father anything that he died for that you're confessing that he's done now notice the link the Lord Jesus is there as our high priest to be able to make good everything that his word says but it must line with your confession so if you say well I I'll never have Victory he cannot confess that before the father because that's not what he says so you say well I I'm not healed I guess I'll just be sick all of my entire life so where does the bible say that where does the bible say you can't have peace and joy and power and a life filled with oh my with the glory of God where does the bible say we can't have it so we do all of this talking and all this confessing when the Lord Jesus desires for us and him to say the same thing can you imagine when you say the same thing his word says about you he confesses your confession before the E Hallelujah before the Eternal God and then you and him are lined up and it will come to pass oh my you know brother Ram tells us that Abraham received a promise from God and he watered that promise every day with praises Praise Is water on the seed of God's word notice this again and accept God's gift I love this one to me it is just absolutely tremendous healing is not something that you just say well I believe it I believe it and I said that's all right if that's the best you can do just mentally or just say well I see it I believe it I accept it then if you accept it on that basis keep saying it over and over and say it out loud now why because in your subconscious remember the prophet tells us there's a man down in the engine room and then there's a man in the ship and he's the one up on the deck he's the captain he's the one who makes the calls down to the guy in the engine room and the guy in the engine room is the one who actually directs the ship now he said you will say you believe your word that believe God's word that's the captain that's the senses up here but the man down inside of you in the subconscious he'll say well God Did It for so and so but he won't do it for you and you you've asked God about this now how many times and God still ain't done it this is the guy that runs the ship himself and then whenever you go to saying God's word by his stripes I am healed well I'm just keeping it to myself that's exactly what the devil wants you to do the devil knows there is power in you hearing yourself say God's word oh Hallelujah it ain't enough just to say it on the inside but say it amen I am healed I am delivered I am a child of God I have Victory amen [Applause] keep saying it over and over say it out loud say it over and over just keep saying it I'm Healed I'm heal now listen to these words and then he says say it until you actually believe it so you mean you can start saying it and don't believe it exactly amen don't never have a a negative testimony every time you confess it well I still feel bad today you'll go right back to the same rut you was in the beginning there's not a man or woman here baptized with the Holy Spirit if you would start your confession I believe I've lost the Holy Spirit I believe it's gone from me you'll go right down from right there why because God made us a Creator we are creators of both positive and negative and we're able to create an atmosphere every one of us here today create the atmosphere we live in remember we are astronauts amen we are astronauts if astronauts go to the Moon they don't let the atmosphere of the moon affect them why they take their own atmosphere with them they have a space suit they have a space suit they walk on the moon with their own atmosphere so are we living in the middle of Le DEA and darkness and chaos but I am an astronaut amen I refuse to live in the atmosphere of Le to se of [Applause] Sinise again he says don't have no negative testimony testify positive Jesus says heal me and I'm well no matter how you're feeling oh that's what gets us though well how do you feel you'd have to be pretty well dumb not to feel something here the way these meetings have been numb and couldn't oh but Dy when the devil is going to bother you it's when you leave this atmosphere then you head down the road and you get home and all kinds of problems away but you can stand when you get home with the same Victory you feel right here today because you believe God loves you he cares for you notice the prophet said if you get back to that every time you have a negative testimony and you look at your symptoms you're falling right then there's not a Christian in you no matter how solid you are in the faith if right now something happened to get a hold to you you and tell you you're not a Christian and you start testifying well I'm not a Christian no more you've dropped right then you're not a Christian from that point on as soon as you testify you're not a Christian you Dro From Grace you're Fallen because your own speech tells what you are it's oh my it's faith that acts every time so what is your confession I talk about in church I a't talk about in front of everybody I'm talking about you when you and you and you are alone your soul your spirit your body what talking what selft talk do you do to yourself well yall quiet this morning I noticed brother man said it's a strange thing so much people thought of in this day and they say well I'm weak in faith my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're talking his language now you imagine no curse words or nothing like that which would not come out of our mouths at all and we say oh well I'm just not a very good Christian I don't have much faith I'm not this I'm not the other that's exactly what Satan wants you to say don't never let your T testimony be negative let it be positive all the time I am saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart do you believe in Divine Healing with all my heart let your testimony and your thoughts never let a negative thought come in your mind if you can help it and when it starts don't entertain it you say well I can't keep the thoughts from coming well be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from rooting you can't help thoughts when they come but don't entertain them so are you getting in your automobile you're going to work it's Monday morning somebody gets in the car with you his name is Lucifer you say fuckle up devil it's a law here in Virginia it's amazing to me how much people can tell you and quote you things the devil told them 40 years ago and they can't hardly quote one quote to save their life well the devil told me this and the devil told me that and the devil told me this and the devil what are you doing memorizing his words you're you're talking about if preachers lied to you the way the devil did You' star and feather him why do we even listen to that liar why do we believe one word he [Applause] says oh my my my notice this brother R said God can only bless you as you confess he has done it for you he is the high priest of our confession is that right Hebrews three he can only do for us you're talking about three powerful aspects in this principle of God he can only do for us as we accept it and believe it and confess it what is that a b c accept believe confess amen a do you believe ABC accept believe and confess oh but what if what if what if I get up I get pray for and something happens and I I go to testifying about and then it don't happen it don't happen then what have I done that's what keeps many of us back our fear of failure we're so afraid the Bible tells me in Revelation those who will be cast into to hell are the fearful you know what that word means those who refuse to go on with God they're not infidels they're not unbelievers but they were so fear afraid of failure that they just stood on the outside of it well you know it's good for everybody else but I don't think I could well praise the Lord why you worry about this service being long willly I want you to notice this again brother B says remember God will make your body come into your confession friends where do we get this idea that we've all got to die sick where do we get this idea we we talk so much about Divine Healing I believe in Divine Healing I also believe in preaching Divine heals I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in the ER that thou May prosper and be in the walkin that thou mayest prosper and be in Heth even as thy Soul proper brother Dy were living in Leia which makes it a greater Miracle pray well my my family cancer runs in my family and TB runs in my family but you're Born Again you've got another heavenly father that gives you a declaration of Faith we're waiting for cancer we're waiting for TB we're waiting for adultery let's wait for the Rapture let's look to our face and his word and say who says I have to have it notice this he says if you say you're a drunkard and want to drink don't worry you'll soon be one if you say you're a sinner and want to sin now we're talking about folks that has a profession now of Christianity but they go to talking drinking they go to Talking sin and they will talk theirself right out of their Christian experience we're not talking about Born Again folks now sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we heard that so beautifully last night but we're talking about folks that have an intellectual Faith but all of a sudden their conversation their communic ation changes your testimony will bring you right into it if you believe in healing and believe that God has healed you and confession God will make your body obey your confession well if God can do that with Divine Healing what about an addiction to pornography what about an addiction to something else cannot God make your fingers obey the confession of the word of God I think it's pretty sad when the smartphones are smarter than the owners well that didn't cost you nothing notice he said you go R out of this building tonight testifying that you're saved but what if you go out and say well I don't know I don't know if I'm saved God will make your body obey your confession remember he will make your body obey your confession so what do you talk about so much of your days what do you say about you and God you and your family you and your church you and the Rapture you and the resurrection you and the Millennium what do you say about you well from today by the help of the Lord I'm going to give you some things to talk [Applause] about and this is what as the people of God if you aren't already doing it we need to make some improvements let's start with the simple Basics I'm forgiven this is our confession I'm forgiven I'm saved I wrote a bunch of them down my memory ain't near quite what it used to be so I B wrote a bunch of these down I'm forgiven I'm saved I'm redeemed I'm Justified I'm bought and purchased my body is his Temple Hallelujah when Satan comes against you with some sort of Temptation to get you to do this or that you remind that devil in that Temptation my body is a tabernacle of the Holy Ghost I am tabernacling deity I don't need to look at that I don't need to do this I don't need to say that amen my body is a tabernacle of the Lord Hallelujah I have eternal life I have access to God I am Inseparable from Christ I am more than a conqueror he will renew my strengths I have value in God's eyes eyes as a matter of fact I am the apple of his eyes I am accepted in Christ God will meet my needs I am made the righteousness of God I am loved by God he cares for me I'm me just drop this one in now which ain't on my notes it'll make Psalms 23 a whole lot more personal the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pasture he leadth me beside the still wat he restores my soul oh Hallelujah to God he anointed my head with oil my C brought us over bless said be the name of the Lord surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord [Applause] forever I am an overcomer I have self control that's what's wrong the majority of the people of the world they've lost control of theel but as a child of God I have self- control the Lord is my strength he is my deliverer he is my defense he is my Refuge he is my peace he is my mediator he will work all things for my good now if I just stop right here right here and you all would take these things and apply them all of us preachers included to our lives I wonder what kind of folks would' be I wonder if we realize how much negativity that we live in how much Satan is trying his best for many of you I don't know how the devil knows if a person has the holy ghost or not but no doubt there's a sphere there's a way the pulsation of light from your soul there's some way that he can look and see and know that you're different than everybody else and he no longer tries to attack the realm of the soul but he'll attack the spirit and he'll attack the body and he'll try to cause all kinds of situations in your home in your life in your church and our minds are in such turmoil come on Saints and we don't know what to do which way to turn anybody there of course you are and yet what does it do if he cannot stop you from being a child of God he wants to rob you of the full benefit of what Jesus Christ died for so we're sad we're oppressed we're depleted and we're just not sure if we can make it another day or not so we get out of bed oh no I didn't die with a heart attack during the night oh God a lot of folks want to go to heaven sure we all do that are Christians but I'll tell you some folks desire to go to heaven is to get out of this world they just don't want to deal with difficulty they don't want to deal with hardship well I'm going to tell you something friend I believe we as children of God were born to torment hell amen as the children of God the prophet said that I believe a man or woman can live so close to God that the devil don't know what to do with you can you imagine you getting up every morning and the devil saying oh no oh oh no here she comes oh no here he come get out of their way get out of their way they are on fire with [Applause] God so how do you tarded Fox News CNN abc yahoo so many got shot so many got killed Trump did this Trump did that Trump did something else I'm looking for the last Trump but it sure ain't the one in the white house it make no difference who takes the White House she she's going to be on Redemption right but how much of it during the day everything happens hurricane turned into cat five 165 miles an hour oh my we're no notified we're notified we're notified some of you smart folks need to come up with a smart app on our phone to help notify us how much God loves us just every hour or so just a reminder he died for you another reminder Hallelujah he gave his life for you he filled you with the Holy Ghost just a reminder of good news [Applause] and then we make it to the house of God we drag in and we're wore out it is one of the most comfortable places left in our life so we get in praise God Everything feels so much lighter so much better you know really I don't get mad at folks for going to sleep in church is the most comfortable place we got left honestly I'm not saying it to be to make make a joke because the burdens of the of the world and they roll away and we finally get relaxed is that what the Lord Jesus meant for us to be I thought we were we were the capping of all the ages so we're barely to hang on to the end and then when the end comes we'll barely just you know for fall and come up into the gates and just I made it God friends I just can't believe that I believe when this bride leaves this world she's going to leave with the crowning glory of God hallelujah it ain't going to be you that's barely hanging but the devil will say I'm glad they're out of hereen I'm glad they're out of here [Applause] praise [Music] God so we get up and start checking our Facebook and I can't believe they posted that about me we'd be better off to have our face in the original book let me go on I ain't supposed to be meddling now this morning he is my peace he will work all things to my good I am his workmanship and he makes No Junk praise God he will complete me some may you ever get discouraged where you are and just seem like you ain't going nowhere and growing and all that you know when we get right down to the final stages you you change away from 80 grit sandpaper and 40 grit and all that you get down to a th000 maybe 1,500 or 2,000 it's a polishing stage and many of you can think about oh when I first got say I dropped off cigarettes and drinking and this and that but boy don't seem like I'm going nowhere well you may not be growing in great chunks or Leaps and Bounds but you're entering into the polishing mirroring stage to where he's delicately working on you oh my taking away everything that displeases him in order to bring you into the complete image of what the bride ought to be is that our desire he will complete me I have a sound mind that's a miracle in this age I am needed in the body of Christ nobody can take my place come on now don't sit there and look at me and act like you want me to believe that you've never felt like you wasn't needed we all want to feel needed do we not even us as preachers we want to feel needed and wanted well let me tell you this morning you are needed in so much that almighty God is not complete without you he will keep me I am his and he is mine he is my shepherd and I am his sheep he loads me daily with Benefits he brought me Abundant Life he wants my fellowship don't you understand friends prayer should not be a labor ious thing prayer should not be something that you oh I dread it I dread it I've got to pray it should be something we long in our hearts and you don't have to just do it when you're in the closet you can do it when you're pushing a buggy down Walmart the grocery line when your brothers are hammering a nail when you're painting a wall he wants your fellowship oh this would transform us if we could grasp that one thing the Lord Jesus God Almighty wants our fellowship we would give it to him so freely instead of him having to beg for it he is my sufficiency he will never overload me I need help with that one sometimes maybe I'm the only one here but sometimes you say oh Lord you know this low Jour you're dealing with this and you're dealing with that so this is My Confession I'm not telling you what to do I'm just sharing with you what my confession is of me as a Believer and what I'm able to see in the word that is my inheritance and I say these things I say these things to God about me and my walk and my relationship cuz you see I was raised in a family where my daddy told me you're stupid you're ignorant you'll never Mount to nothing oh Donnie all Donnie has is the word Donnie will never do this Donnie will never do that it's taken me Decades of my life to break away from that image of my natural father to the image of my heavenly father he will keep me th will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee I am his friend and he is mine I am one of his branches I will bring forth fruit I am in Christ I am one spirit with him I am complete in him he is my high priest he is the author and finisher of my face oh I'm thinking about quitting how in the world can I quit anything I never started in the first place you never started that work in you you wasn't the one that called you you wasn't the one that saved you he called you before the foundation of the world and there ain't enough devils in Hell there ain't enough human beings on the earth even our own slothfulness will never break that [Applause] call he is not ashamed over me he is my brother he is my healer he hears my prayers he answers my prayers he is my helper he is my pro peace provider he is my help in the time of trouble he is my comforter paracletos one called alongside to help in the time of trouble he will comfort me his grace is sufficient for me he will never leave me nor forsake me sin has no dominion over me hallelujah hallelujah sin if you're dealing with with a besetting sin and you're dealing with something in your life keep saying it over and over and over again you devil you pornography you smoking whatever it is I refuse for you to dominate my life sin will have no dominion over me amen you will not rule me you will not control me or you can say well my daddy had this porn problem my uncle had it they called him in the seart or you know whatever grocery store it was so I guess I'm just doomed with it yeah your mouth your mouth it just spoke your body into a finale of possession do you understand friends once we enter into this negativity demons and Satan you just go down in hell drink a good cold glass of Southern tea and eat a baloney sandwich and eat a little Debbie when it's all done cuz we will devastate our own selves well the devil done this and the devil don't blame the devil for a lot of stuff that we've done I go to smelling this same feeling at the home church and I go to preaching on and stuff like that smells like hide Ro thing you know brother Don surely you don't believe we can live a Godly life young people yes there will be young people come out of this age the most wretched dark sinful Wicked age that's ever been there will be young men and young women that will come out of this age and they're not hanging on Mama's coattail or Daddy's coattail or the preacher's coattail they're going to come out of this age a new creature in Christ Jesus amen they may have had all kinds of strains in their family but they took the word of God and they accepted and believed and confessed so can you imagine one of the books of the New Testament being named after you if you read the book of fimon you'll notice that Paul leaves out the apostolic Authority that he has he leaves out all that which he addresses in Philippians and all the other books because this is actually a personal letter to an individual I'm so glad it was included in the Bible that can you imagine if you got have enough Fai today to be able to not add to or take away but to be able to read yourself into the scripture that this could be called The Book of Mary or the book of Wang or the book of Joe or the book of Tim and almighty God would say I've directed one of my servants to speak to you this morning to be able to energize your faith to help you to not acknowledge and understand the power of your words will you get up the end the service and say I'm not sure what he was trying to say surely he don't think that we can live that I do but this is the most evil Wicked right but you don't believe God can keep us I do brother Tim said last time 50 years now brother Tim 50 years been preaching the message of the hour I got saved when I was 12 years old I'm now 6 three three 51
