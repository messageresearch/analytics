remembering that family there how many would have an unspoken request you'd like to lift up to the lord we know god sees and meets each and every one of these requests this morning don't we amen i'm going to ask brother gabriel spencer if he would come lead us to the throne of grace this morning [Music] before we bow our heads i just want to testify with a miracle that i saw and this was this was back when i was six seven years old when we were coming home from church and i just the reason i want to testify this is because i believe in a god that works miracles and it's not only in our lives but everywhere around us as well and as we were coming home from church i was i was actually asleep in the back seat of the car and i wake up to us hitting the deer and as the deer it goes it was a nice little eight point buck and you hunters know once once a deer gets hit that's injured it's not going to come around it's it's going to take off it's going to find something what it's laying over the ditch and as we stop the car we look over and dad actually gets out and he said you know i don't want to let us suffer well as he gets out of the car the deer gets up and can barely walk and it walks starts walking back across the road as he's walking across the road dad just gets back in the car and said okay well maybe it's gonna be okay or it walks and it just stops right in front of our car so we can't move and it just looks into the into the window of the car so dad said well maybe it wants prayer so mom opens up the passenger side of her window and this buck walks right around to the passenger side of the window and sticks his head antlers and all inside the vehicle so we pray for it we begin to pray for it and we actually pick out all the grass and dirt that's in the antlers of that deer as soon as we get done praying for it dad that says go on and be healed in the name of jesus christ and as he says that that deer just eases his head back out the window and just nods to us and takes off running just as nothing's ever even been done to it before and i've seen miracles happen like that before in our life and if you say you i haven't seen a miracle like that we saw one last night we see one step in front of us every sunday morning when he comes out to preach we got we serve a goddess that works miracles and don't take for granted the miracle that comes and stands in front of us every sunday morning when he comes out let's just bow our heads and believe for everything that we are asking for can be answered [Music] lord jesus we just thank you for the wonderful opportunity that we have this morning the opportunity to come that that many take for granted and they don't even think to to come into service on a sunday morning or a sunday night or saturday night we can just come and we can offer every need that we have we can offer every every healing that we are asking for we can ask for prodigals to come home lord jesus just as i've just testified as you will work miracles and animals just to believe to to lift our faith in front of us lord and i'm believing for even greater things than that i'm believing for prodigals to come home sons and daughters brothers and sisters moms and dads wherever they may be at wherever they may be lord jesus i'm believing that you can just go speak to their heart this morning speak to their heart and bring them into the into the services of god to give their give their all back unto you as we hear the the surgeries that may be going on with uh sister charlene with her eyes lord jesus we're believing for a full restoration that she will be able to see and there will be no issues there anything else that we may be asking for whatever way the prayer requests that are offered up lord jesus i ask you to just be with them touch their lives be with us this morning come and speak through the minister of uh of your hour this morning that we that we may be able to hear from you and you may speak to our heart this morning we just thank you for all that you were doing for us in jesus name we pray amen amen good to be here this morning isn't it amen at this time we're going to receive this morning's offering

star lord you are our lily in the valley you are the rose of sharon you are alpha and omega and you're so special that you've become a friend each and every one of us we have felt your nearness lord

day you would say would you walk with me god we want to walk with you in every step of this message i pray father this morning that you'd have your way in this service we love you lord with all our hearts in jesus name man if you have your bibles we like to look over in the book of the poetry there in ecclesiastes uh chapter three ecclesiastes chapter three amen chapter 3 this morning and say amen when you have it i love that sound the pages of the bible just flowing open it's that scam it's that sound that scares the devil but it's more than just pages that he's scared of it's a people that have become a materialization of the very word of god ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse 1 for everything there is a season and a time for every purpose under heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to cue and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to seek and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away a time to tear a time to sow time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time for war and a time for peace and verse 11 says he hath made everything beautiful in his time may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord so as we have read here this morning we realize that there is a time for everything and we realize that that we are in one of the greatest greatest of times that we've ever been living in and but yet we're living in a time where so much is changing there's constantly change and if there's one thing that could be said is that if there's a constant in this life is that things change and we look out upon this world and we see that the changing of time is upon us as we look out upon the leaves and we realize that that the sap is going down out of the trees and we realize that the leaves will soon be falling and some starting to fall according to the different times and seasons and the and the migration of different things and and droughts and and waters and different things but everything is constantly changing and we realize that that change change happens and most of us as human beings we hate change my little daughter ally we can move a piece of furniture and she can break out in a tear just in a matter of seconds she's always done that from a little bitty baby she can break out and cry without a with within a drop of a hat but you move one piece of furniture and and she'll just begin to cry and said dad things are always changing and you know humanity we we don't like change we get comfortable in the way that we are and we just don't want to we don't want to move out of our comfort zone and we don't want to we don't like change but god god has given us a a scripture and a formula to know that change is a good thing as well change ain't always bad but change is always it isn't always a bad thing but change is for the good it just look at your own personal life and you look at how you were and you watched the change that happened it wasn't a bad thing because you were a rotten stinking scoundrel but you watched the change that come and happened in your life and we realized that man was built to advance and man was built to go on and move higher but when man become in a state of stagnancy and you realize that when men get when men get in that spot of stagnancy that they begin to lose at sight of the goal that is set before them and that is why that we must always stay persistent and we must always stay perseverant before the promises of god and realizing that that he is running after us just as much as we are running after him and there is a goal that is ahead and paul would say that that i am running this race with patience and there's a there's a goal that is set before us and and though though you might be running through this journey in life and there's things that you're running past and things that are changing in your view and in your scenery but realize that there's a goal that is ahead and we're looking at this this morning and realizing that there is a time for a change to happen and then we look at men that they they get into a spot of stagnancy and men get caught up in a job and they they lose they lose their love for the job or men get caught up in a relationship or they get bored with a relationship so they're looking for somebody else and come on somebody they're looking for a change of scenery they're looking for a a fresh a breath of fresh air and maybe a fresh outlook on life and humanity's got to humanity's always got to be moving and always got to be doing things but you know i know that there are things that sometimes that you just got to go on a vacation because you just need a break from you need a break from who you are you need a break from everything you've been through and you need a you need a vacation from yourself but yeah i'm so glad that god never has to have a change of scenery with you and i he he never gets tired of what he's looking at it even though we daily we fall and daily we we get back up and daily we we stay in his promises but i'm so glad that he don't get tired of looking at me and looking at my problems and looking at my anxieties or looking at my fears or looking at your problems but he's always there and to realize that there is a constancy in our life that that things are always changing we're advancing we want a better job we want a better house what is that showing it is showing that humanity was built to advance and if we could build these kind of vessels and these kind of buildings it is showing that there is something in the eternity that would make us long for something that does not change and we realize that god is the god that does not change and he's a god that always remains the same and this is what we realize that there is politics that are always changing the demographics of the land are always changing you watch as you watch buildings that you'll watch how that men will move a civilization and you will watch how that one place becomes deserted and the town moves on and it just goes outside of the skirts maybe a mile or two and you'll watch that place becomes a ghost town because they were not willing to move on with change in 2020 throughout a pandemic a lot of a lot of businesses didn't want to change so they died and they are a ghost town but people have to be able to adapt to change but this is what i want to get to you today before we move forward is that you are serving a god that does not change you don't have to advance into you don't have to advance and think my i've got to get up there with god or god's got to get down here with me god is not changing he is consistent in all of his ways he is he is not slack concerning his promises and just like we know that that that presidents can change their policies but a king can never change his promises if a king once says one thing it's got to come to pass exactly the way the king has wrote it and this i know that what jesus has said is forever the truth now notice what the bible says in psalms 102 and 24 i said oh my god take me not away in the midst of my days thy years are throughout all generations of old hast thou laid the foundations of the earth the heavens are the work of thy hands but they shall perish but thou shall endure yea all of them shall wax old like a garment as a vesture shalt thou change them and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall have no end the children of thy servants shall continue and their seed shall be established before thee the things that we look at on a daily basis they might change the people around us might change there might be people that are around you that might walk away from this truth there might be people that are around you that might go by the way of the grave the scenery around you might change but the god who holds your destiny in his hands the god that knows your beginnings and the god that knows your endings the god that knows your good times and the god that knows your bad times the god that holds your life in his hands the god that knows every hair on your head the god that knows the fleas the god that knows all the sparrows is a god that is saying that i will not change everything around you is changing but as he said in malachi chapter 3 i am the lord our god and i change not but this is what i want you to know he's not just telling you that i won't change he's not just good enough to say that i'm not changing but this is he's saying is that his elect his seed shall remain and they shall be established in the earth there are things that are changing there are people that are moving there are people that are passing by but you as the elect of god have put on have put on a righteous robe by the blood of jesus christ change ain't always a bad thing but change will make you move to where god is wanting you at you remember when the prophet was up there at cherith where there was no rain for three and a half years that god was going to take care of his prophet when he was up there and and he got he got to a spot where there was no water but he went up there to the brook of cherith and there we realized that god was using a paradox to come feed him manna he would feed him manna through ravens that would come and one day the ravens stopped bringing food and one day the bible said in verse 7 that the brook dried up what was god doing he was making him to move on and you know we will go through spots of times like that in our life when things seem to be running out and seems things seem to be empty and things seem to dry up and man i really enjoyed those services a while ago but i i just don't know i just don't i don't feel the same way that i that i that i know i need to feel about it it's like the new has worn off you know it's just like that toy you got on christmas if you really if you if you really don't have a new birth the new aware off of it and church will just become some some meeting but this is more than just a meeting of of the minds and a meeting of people but this is a conference with the holy ghost but there will be times in your life in a season when it seems like god ain't came by your way but god ain't forgot you there might becomes in your life when you feel like man alive does god even love me i've been out here have been fed all these days and so many times we get like jonah and we care more about our little bitty tree than we care about the souls down there in enema and you know we look at these things and we say you know what god god doesn't love me he dried up these things and now i don't know if i really have an experience or not but i want to say this to you god's hardest words are not his last words his hardest words are not his last words you might go through a spot and it feels like man he has taken the belt to my heart he's whooped me upside down and one thing or another he beats me over this or he whips me over that ye i just feel like i'm going through a spot with well i don't even know if he loves me anymore it shows you're a son if you can stand the chastisement but those that are bastard children can't handle what you're going through his hardest words are not his last words and what god has for you ending at cherith will lead you to a zero path what is going to bless you in one spot is going to take you to another journey and when you get to xeropath you won't be the only one that will be eating meals and cakes but there will be a widow and her son you may have dried up in one spot but god's wanting to further your experience into the holy ghost god ain't wanting you to stay stale and stay comfortable where you're at and that's the problem with so many people that they get into a spot of justification and sanctification and they feel like i've went far enough and they'll stay right there and they are in a very dangerous and a very troublesome time as they get comfortable where they're living at they've got a new spirit but they don't have his spirit and they can feel the anointing come on their flesh and man can they get emotional man can they shout they are in a time but you cannot stop in the transition you have to move forward god's not willing that you would perish he's not willing that you would get stale in your experience but god is wanting to advance you into the holy ghost and you begin to watch as god comes down and begins to move over a congregation you'll watch as he begins to remove the staleness over that life you'll watch when somebody goes cold or they go formal and you'll watch one time in the presence of almighty god they're kind of like a chicken over there they they they you know that chicken is a bird just like an eagle it's got feathers just like an eagle but that chicken is an earthbound creature and it can't get no higher than just a little bitty feet or a few feet off of the ground but that eagle is built for a spot that he could fly into the heavenlies and that mother eagle is not willing that her children would walk around in a state of staleness and stay there and look like a bunch of chickens but when it comes for a time and a season when those little eaglets have feathered out mother looks at them and says it's time to stir the nest and if god let me say this to you feel like you got kicked out of the nest god has not forgot about you and god ain't going to let you fall to the ground god is going to raise you up because there's something laying on the inside of you that he deposited that nature is laying there you know there's some people that live a chicken life where they've got just enough religion just to make them miserable you watch a chicken and man and lava can get under the greatest auspices of the holy ghost and they can get so high but they'll never get no higher but you watch an eagle one time they'll soar up one time and they say hey i felt good i'm going up one more time i'm taking it up higher your wings were built so that you could come out of these things it's a time to change positions and god when we look at at the ending of the days of moses when he thought man what in the world are we going to do now our prophets gone but god began to take them in to the promises he began to lay out the borders and he had a changing of administration and you find that what the bible says in joshua 1 and 9 have not commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whithersoever thou goest deuteronomy 31 8 and the lord then the lord he it is that doth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed there are going to come times in your spots in your life when there's changing happening that is happening around you maybe somebody goes off the scene or maybe your connection maybe have died out just for a minute but realize that it's a timing and a transition time that you are going to a spot when moses when moses could only take them so far it come time for joshua under his commission to take them into the land but do you think he caught god off surprise when moses went out there and smote the rock twice it didn't catch him off guard he knew he was making a way for a joshua commission to come in the past and this is what this message is it's a laying out of the borders the prophet could take you so far and the prophet could go but here jehovah jesus savior has come to lead you into the promises of the message of the hour and if you're not willing to advance into the holies of holies you'll stay out there where it's all cloudy you'll stay out there where it's all smoky and you're gonna get in trouble i'll tell you what'll happen if you get in that kind of condition in a spot of sanctification you'll get like aaron's two sons nadab and abyhu over in leviticus chapter 10 when they got out there and they try to create their own religion of the message and try to create their own ideas of how the holy ghost wants to be and how the holy ghost was supposed to be given and how the holy ghost was supposed to be preached and they brought in a strange fire and god killed them on the spot because god would never allow a strange fire to come in and take the place of the baptism of the holy ghost it ain't my idea it ain't my words it's god's words and the only thing that'll keep burning is the fire that was put on the altar in the very first place it's a holy fire that's too many people around the ranks of the message today they try to put a strange fire in things but it'll die right where it's at you watch people in their spiritual walk and you'll see that they can't go no further because they have died and god will never let a strange fire get in his way lord have mercy you remember when you remember when balaam when balaam was asked by bailiff he's one there's a lot of people jealous you he was wanting balaam that that was operating that was operating as a prophet he was wanting him to go up there and he was wanting him to go up here and curse israel but notice what balaam did he he did the right thing first he went up there and he shot god let me ask god what what his thoughts is on these things and god said don't touch a member of my people and that's what that's what the enemy is wanting to do is to is to curse you he's wanting to torment you and he's wanting to destroy you but i want to say this to you that god will never disappoint you that god will never let you down and god will never be proven wrong ah let me come down just a little bit further and god won't just be just he won't just come down and be proven wrong as himself but god will not allow he will not allow your experience to be proven wrong you know when the enemy comes in like a flood god will raise up the standard and when the enemy comes in to try to prove whether you got the goods or not god will make sure to prove that you got it he will prove his word that the same way they got it up there in acts 2 is the same way that you get it god ain't going to let you down god ain't going to back off of his promises god ain't going to let no man curse you how can you curse what god has decided to bless and balaam grabbed over in numbers 23-19 that god is not a man humanity's fleeting and humanity's failing but god is not a man elohim is not a man he is the self-existing one he can do without the politics and the religions of the world but god is not a man that he could lie [Applause] neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or have he spoken it and shall he not make it good he is the same yesterday today and forever first corinthians 10 and 13 the bible said there have no temptation taken you but such is common to man but god is faithful somebody say god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that that you are able but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it second corinthians 4 and 16 for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day amen amen for our light affliction which is just for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding an eternal weight of glory moses come to a spot and god said moses you have circled this mountain long enough it is time to move on you have circled the baptism of the holy ghost you have circled that spot of sanctification long enough it's time to move on and with those people of the old generation won't worship him god will raise up a new generation that'll worship him in spirit and in truth this is high time that the church of the living god raised to her potential [Applause] you remember you remember that indian chief he was up there and he said how you doing indian chief how you doing up here chief he's swelling not too good i got a warrant inside of me so what's going on what's going on so well i got two dogs on the inside of me one's white one's black and they're constantly growling and they're constantly fighting at one another and they said well well who who's winning he said the one that i feed the most and the one if you keep feeding your carnal nature that's the one to keep winning if you keep feeling sorry for yourself living in a spot of of just living here of of feelings and emotions you will never live any higher your christian faith is not built upon your emotions let me tell you god if god was building your your christian faithful emotions and what you feel and what you see it wouldn't be nobody's heading here but by the grace of god he didn't build your christian faith on what you see what you feel what you smell what your emotions are he built it thus on thus saith the lord are you going to feed who are you going to feed there is going to be a war inside but notice when paul goes over there in the book of hebrews and he starts preaching on the promises of god are more and greater and he goes over there in hebrews 9 and he starts pulling out that the blood of bulls and goats was there and it's sanctified to the purifying of the flesh he said but how much more how much more shall the blood of the lamb jesus christ also purge your conscience from dead works to serve a living god you don't know what i've been through brother andrew you don't know the mind battles that i go through i you don't know what i did in my past that's why there's a blood your emotions and your past man it's stacked up against you everybody here's gotta man i tell you what if we could read your first book it would tell us some awful deeds i'm real glad i'm real glad i can't read sister stephanie's i'm real glad i can't read brother jerry's i'm real glad i can't read brother clarence's let me get a little personal i'm glad that i can't read the fraser and the spencer's first book man it was a bunch of bad dudes in that thing a bunch of mixed up crowds a bunch of bootleggers and a bunch of moonshiners oh but the blood of jesus christ purges you from your conscience to serve a living god he said well i keep having these bad thoughts of what i did and what i should do and what i would what i fell into i believe the blood is big enough to purge your memory i believe that the blood is strong enough to purge every sin that was committed before you recognize and even after you recognize the blood is for you church of the living god and when the blood has set you free if you accept it if you accept this pardon it will purify your soul it'll purify your mind but a pardon is only a part in if it's accepted as a party the governor has walked into your chambers today and said you're free if you want to go free you're free from your bondage you're free from your mind you're free from your complexes you're free from your guilt you're cleansed from your own dead forms you're cleansed from your filth oh the governor's walked into your courts johnny crowe you can go free you can go free you've been staying there too long chained up to that pole as a good man to come by your cell today and say johnny go ahead and fly all the other birds are flying south the only thing that is keeping you there is your mind battle and we realize that that is where the greatest battles fall out anywhere it stays at though but you can go free you have been unchained by the anointing of almighty god i know it's been a little while for you i know it's been a little while for you you gave your heart to god and he fell back in he fell back in a little hole i know it's been a little while for you you forgot how to use him things but i would tell you you got what it takes to come off of it you got what it takes to come off the ground you got what it takes to live up there where you are built to live at oh i'm preaching to you today it's a time for you to change your thinking and change over to his thinking that's why paul would say in philippians 2 and 5 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus he took on the form of humanity so that he could think like humanity he could be like humanity and he proved that he had the power over death hell and the grave even humanity even the mind battles i am cleansed i am washed i am safety fire i'm holy ghost filled i water baptized i'm one with my god for all times cause jesus my savior he's alive it reaches to the highest mountain oh and it flows to the low over your habits over your addictions over all your complexes and your stigmas and mind battles it flows past those things he flows past your humanity it flows past what you think it flows past all of those things there's a blood trail that satan can't cross it's a time for change notice if god be forced then where be all his miracles he said and that's the same now it's time the time has come for action at the time has had come when playing church had come to a halt with god and there's no play in church we must get down to business and i trust that the same god will make this upon the heart of the people tonight that it's a time for a heart of playing church and playing religions and playing righteous and now it's a time for action as i was speaking this morning upon the subject of the new birth and what it was and how we how how we come to it surely that still sinks into your heart now the time has come to act upon what you know to be the truth you cannot act with faith until you first know what you're doing you've got to first know what you're doing before you can have faith to do it and someone had said to me one time i i know the doctrine was talking about a miracle that had happened among a six per a sick person and he said to me preacher don't you believe that if you told them people to go out and touch a tree or a post that the same thing would take place i said well no sir i said because you cannot have faith in touching a tree or a post faith is not that loose it's got to be based upon some noted fact that you've got to know something about what you're having faith in before you can have faith in it if it was that loose that you could go and touch that post right there man a lot of you got in trouble and you was a hundred miles away from that post well i guess god ain't god no more but your faith ain't in a post your faith ain't in a tree your faith ain't in your feeling your faith ain't in your emotion but your faith is based upon the what the blood has said about you you know when jesus is coming down to the close of his ministry and he comes over there that that he says howbeit when the spirit of truth has come that he will guide you into all truth he will take a mind and he will show it before you and we're living in an hour when we when when when men are following men i never thought that we'd come to a day like we've come to today in the social realm of things when people are going about man did you see who's following me man i got the most popular person down there church following me i got the i got the bishop where i got the i got the mayor following me when you know i was always raised all my life it was about who you following it was about following jesus it wasn't about the mayor it wasn't about who was following you it was about jesus you following jesus everywhere i could care less what you got on your insta face and all of your friends if you ain't got the friend jesus you ain't got one friend but the bible said that we have not received the spirit of the world but we have received the spirit of almighty god that he would lead us into these things and we know that christianity that mortals are influenced by this realm of the heaven above and we realize that there are demons that also influence so we are going to be influenced by one realm or another i have told you parents be careful and watch the influence if the influence has taken you away from the promises of god you're watching that that is not the comforter that'll guide you into all truth but if it's a comforter of the flesh it'll lead you to destruction but the comforter of the soul will lead you to all truth remember when he got up early when he got up there on that indian death walk he got up here on hurricane mountain he got walking around i'm a pretty good indian i got i got it laid up in my i got it laid up in my dna and you know you got that pride built up and that pride pride's a good thing if it's used in the right way but we realize that the crown of pride leads to destruction pride i think you ought to take pride in your work got to take pride in who you are as a son and daughter of god but pride can also lead you to destruction here he is walking around up there you know what he's doing up here you know what he's looking for and he gets up there and he gets circled up and he gets so confused and he gets so bombarded of where he's at and he gets up there he gets up there and he ain't got no god to lead him where he's going at and he thought you know i'm going to find my way out of here i i'm too good of a i'm too good of a tracker i'm too good of a hunter i'm too good there's no way i could get lost a pair how many does that sound like your life you've gotten yourself in a condition well i can get myself out of this i get myself out of this trouble i'm getting but finally he got to a spot and he said god i have done got lost on where i'm at i didn't got fogged up in this kind of condition up here on this mountain and i can't get to where i'm supposed to be going at but god if you could just lay your hand on me and point me in the right direction so i know where to go at and god is as good as his word he's an ever-present help in the time of trouble he will lead you he will guide you into all truth oh yeah young people get fogged up in their mind is this right or is that wrong or is this right or do i follow this thing or follow that thing if you ain't following christ you're following the wrong thing [Applause] i i know you've been praying i know you've been praying i want you to be watching for something there's going somebody come by and lay their hand on you and when they do it's time to turn back to look where the sky is part of that it'll lead you in the right direction but you can't stop right there you got to go down through say hey i've been in this spot before i've been in this condition before i've been up here on this mountain before i know that if i can ever get a hold of that line up there if i can touch that line it'll lead me back to everything that i hold dear and everything that i hold true in this world and he just kept walking with a gun in one hand and his hand up and he was going along his way he was trusting in him and if you could ever get your line up it's already set over top of you but all you've got to do is raise your hand raise your hand you'll touch that line oh you'll touch that line it was a time when pride had to fall away and he had to come back and say god i need your help but too many times people get prideful and say i can do this on my own you have had a true way of a prophet set before you you've had a vindicated prophet set before you you've had the supernatural set before you you just reached back up there i i lost sight i got cold i'll let something sneak in but god if you can you just let me get up here i got a pair of my own human spirit i got a pair of my own human ability i couldn't find my way out of it if i wanted to i got myself in a mess i'm gonna tell you get a hold of this line the storms may come the fogs may come and the troubles may come but get a hold of that line and don't you ever let it go i was in a spot of confusion but one time my hand at the lie i decided i ain't gonna let go of it and it led me right back to what i held dear in life you'll go through cycles of revival and death and rival and death because you lost your first love i don't know what else to do don't ever let go well i just throw up my hands and i start praising the lord i'm all by myself up here don't worry he knows how to get you out of it it's a time for a change you remember when when gideon was living in an hour when the midianites had come in and the many nights over in judges chapter 6 and i got time to read it to you but you remember when they got over there in that spot when they when when the israelites had done evil in the sight of the lord and the million lights had had control over top of the nation for seven years and he had they had control over and what they would do is they would come in and they would oppress the land for these seven years and they would come in like an invading locust and they would destroy and that's way the enemy always does he comes in at harvest time when everything's right for season and here these midianites would come in like an invading bug and they would eat down the very life off of the tree and there they would come in and they would camp around the air around the sites of israel and they would come in and they would destroy the crops they would destroy their animals they would plunder through their homes all this was done because they started serving a strange god but god has always had one person that he could put his hand on and he found this little coward to you and i to you and i he looked like a coward he was back there hiding he was back there hiding and he was stretching out the wheat because he wanted just a little bit for his family and notice what he said thou mighty man of valor you were just doing what you were called to do and he called you what you were he didn't call you what you look like aren't you glad he didn't call you what do you look like i could tell you there's a lot of you i'm in your boat with you we didn't look like sons but he didn't call me what i look like he called me what i was you are a mighty man a valor and what did gideon do the very first thing that he did he went up there and he destroyed his father's idols now notice the scripture portrays to us that gideon and his ten men 11 go up there at night time to destroy the the the idols of baal and here when there was one that was a son of perdition that wouldn't go all the way but there was an eleven that would go on into the preaching of the furthing of the baptism of the holy ghost and here we are as the 11th hour workers and we're going to get the same reward we're going to get the same holy ghost and it's a time like never before to go in and destroy destroy the idols of country music oh you was told it was okay to listen to but you listened to it so long that it destroyed your very spirit you listened to your own mind games and you stood there but it's time that you rise up and destroy the works of the enemy why brother andrew country music ain't that bad are you serious you know listen hi and listen to country music and god knows how long but i can tell you when i was back in the day when i was an idiot listen to that stuff i had everything in the world robbed from me by one song lost my girlfriend lost my dog to my best friend jake but i like that southern gospel brother andrew it just [Music] you got to watch the spirit of that too before long you're up here worshiping like bill gaither lord what have you got me into i'm preaching on a time for change it's a time to destroy i can live with that in my closet really can you you might be able to live and get by as a layout of seeing but you cannot live and get by as a church of the living god gideon and the israelites could hide all they want to back there in their closet and they had nothing but stinking skeletons back there hiding in their claws hiding in there for pants hiding they never make up hiding in there with their music that was destroying the very spirit of their soul it was destroying and eating away all of their experience and they went back there to their habits but god was once somebody that would raise up and say hey it's time for a change it's time that we start hiding like a bunch of scaredy cats and we come out front and we start destroying these many nights he didn't call you what you look like he called you what you were and he said go in your strength you may have been born in a poor house of manessa but i got something laying on the inside of you that's built for the challenge you can change this situation young people [Applause] watch a change start happening [Applause] i don't know if i have strength brother let's do it again you remember that little stream there's always bubbling it's because of birds said you're always happy you're always happy why is it because the birds come and drink from you is it because humanity or is it because this no it's none of those reasons i look at brother shannon i think man how can he stay bubbling not me personally i i understand why he's bubbling but he abused people and look how in that thing there can he stay bubbling like that surely he's on the stuff [Applause] i knew it he couldn't live that way all that time he went back that old stinking drinking no he found a new wine you look at him yeah i've been done everything to him i put i put cancer in the pastor i destroyed i tried to destroy their worship i come with covet i come with masks i come with mind battles i come with fear i come with anxiety and they still bubbling what am i doing wrong it ain't us bubbling it's him behind me public it's him behind me pushing me it's him there's been a change in me since jesus set me free i've been to calvary well i'm born again hallelujah hallelujah it come time it come time for a change there's 122 000 i think many nights up there we got 32 000 some israelites down here battle i said no that's too much that's too much they can't go all the way like you're going scenery around me changing the numbers are getting smaller all we can we've been going through layout to see it seems like since 1960 manual numbers keep getting smaller what in the world it's too much it's too much now let's take them down here to this brook let's see how they do are they still serving that old god of bale or they got their eyes on a real prize you see if you if you get your eyes on a stagnant god it'll make you stagnant but if you got your eyes on a living and moving god you'll keep your eyes up there where the promises don't ever change or don't ever cease and you'll keep your eyes up there and you'll watch there'll be some scenery change around you your loved ones might walk away from you but you want to be 300 that'll walk out there and some real sons and daughters of god and take down 122 000 million nights because they were under the auspices of a general by the name of gideon that was a mighty man of valor we are under the auspice of the holy ghost he's a mighty man he's a champion of champions he's a king of kings he's a lord of lords he's greater than alcohol he's greater than tobacco he's greater than your spirit of depression he's greater than your disease he is a champion and he's still gonna win no matter what you put him through he ain't changing he ain't lost the battle yet we'll not be defeated we'll not be defeated we'll not be defeated anymore well since jesus christ god's only son he fought to battle anyone i will not be defeated anymore i've been living that defeated life brother andrew it's time to come up here and stop a living in a defeated spot and start walking to the undefeated realm that you were called to it's time for a change it's time for a change i don't know how i can put the music out i don't know how i sometimes i sometimes i get caught up in all the confusion of all the all the music going at one time the the trombone's going and the triangle is going and and the drums are going and the trumpets are going and all the all the all the all the horn instruments are going and all the all the all the string instruments are going i i just can't seem to find my spot where it's at you watch as that director comes he'll bring some real peace to the chaos and you'll think man alive how in the world [Music] can it get those people in sync they they're so they're so they got so many things on them and you watch that director come here's this director's stick this morning he takes that little stick and he starts waving it and he brings a piece over the people that's a weird stick and he brings a piece and all of a sudden you think there's no way that she's going to make it there's no way she can put forth that kind of broad music and all of a sudden the director takes charge and all of a sudden there comes a change over the atmosphere and everything comes in order and she starts playing that bride music that only she knows how to play and then he calls one from all the way down there in a spot in buena vista virginia there's no way they'll ever live it right and the director grabs a hold of the word and there's a people from univista that scream out amen there's no way those hillbillies from grottos can ever make that bride music work and he starts sweeping over them and they start saying amen to the days of miracles are not past that he's still the same yesterday today and forever he'll go all the way back in the hills of west virginia and he'll get a little red-headed girl there's no way she'll play that music satan you just watch you watch the director's got his hand and his wand in his hand and he's whooping it and he's swirling and he's bringing peace over the chaos of life he will do the work i don't know if i'm going to say this right but there was a great violinist by the name of paganini i did it one time he was going ready getting ready to go out before a great audience and he grabs his violin and he goes out before the people and the people are roaring paganini the great violinist has come he waits for the rush of the of the huss and everything to fall and he starts looking down at his instrument i said something's wrong i'm wrong here this ain't my violin something is something something is wrong and he begins to tell the people that there's something wrong just give me a minute and he goes back in the back to where his violin was and he realized that somebody has stole his famous violin and he walks out before the people and said i'm sorry there's been a great mistake that has taken place somebody has come and stole my famous violin but i want to show you that it's not in the violin but it's in the soul and he starts taking that worthless piece of junk of violin what was it doing the master had it in his hand and you may have looked i know there ain't no way they can do it ain't no way a justin clyde could live that kind of message ain't no way that jason shiftly could ever do it i know good and well that greg mays can't do it so i'll take one of them important people so-called important people and i'll put him in that place ain't no way he could play this kind of music and all of a sudden god starts taking his bow and he starts strumming it across the life of greg mays [Music] he's the one playing the music he's the one that's strumming across your life you could have never come to this position you could have never raised to this spot but he decided oh the enemy came in to steal to kill and destroy he tried to destroy he tried to rob and strip everything off of him let's just face it some of your strings have done been broke and everything's out of whack but he starts tuning the very characteristics of your life and you start portraying that's him and then for a while it looked like man there's no way that jim noel will ever get in tune and he starts bending that thing and he starts strumming it and it's almost there it's almost there and two just somebody of a normal while they think that strain's gonna break at any moment but he knows how much he can take and he starts putting those strings in place and he starts playing on the wings of a snow white dove and these are the things that are to be and he starts playing over your life the sweetest love song i am redeemed when you were worthless he made the most beautiful music come across your life you were in a spot where you weren't able to be god but he knew what you were hiding it when you go to reading over over in the book of luke chapter 8 and you see a woman that's got an issue i mean she's got a bad issue 12 years she's lived with this but she comes in i laid it all down on the line to grab a hold of him and the bible said when she touched him things began to change the people around him began to rebuke and said you're supposed to be the great messiah and you're saying who touched me everybody's touching you there was something different about this woman and when she realized that she couldn't hide no more she began to declare that these were the things that he done you can't hide no more you had faith enough to touch him now it's time to release your testimony i want you to know he's he's got his bow in his hand and he's strumming the great position now it's there i've been so broken and abused and he starts fixing you each stroke oh how i love him oh how i adore him and you start seeking out my breath my sunshine my all in all the great creator tom hill is over you he's strumming out your life just according to the way
