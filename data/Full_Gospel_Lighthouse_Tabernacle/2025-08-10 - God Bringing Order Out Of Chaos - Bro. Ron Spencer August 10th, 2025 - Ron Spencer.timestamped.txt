[34:06] I lift up both my hands
[34:10] and I
[34:13] begin
[34:15] to work
[34:17] your pain.
[34:22] Oh,
[34:24] I worship
[34:27] him
[34:31] when I come into his presence.
[34:38] I humble
[34:40] myself.
[34:41] [Music]
[34:43] I lift up both my hands

[34:50] begin
[34:52] to worship
[34:55] him.
[34:59] Oh,
[35:02] I worship
[35:05] him.

[35:12] what
[35:14] he's done
[35:16] for me,
[35:18] [Music]
[35:21] redeemed,
[35:23] and he said, "Set me free.
[35:27] [Music]
[35:31] because
[35:34] just because
[35:38] he's
[35:40] God.
[35:45] When I come into his presence,
[35:50] I humble
[35:52] myself,
[35:55] remembering what he's done.
[36:06] [Music]
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you want to praise him? Oh,
[36:14] I praise
[36:17] him
[36:19] [Music]
[36:22] for all
[36:26] he's done
[36:29] for me.
[36:33] He redeemed
[36:36] and he set
[36:39] me free.
[36:41] Oh, we
[36:44] call
[36:48] just because
[36:51] he's
[36:54] God
[36:57] for
[36:58] all.
[37:00] He's done
[37:03] for me.
[37:07] me redeemed
[37:10] and he set
[37:12] me free.
[37:17] made me go home
[37:21] just because
[37:25] he is my God
[37:31] and it reaches
[37:35] to the high
[37:38] highest mountain.
[37:40] [Music]
[37:44] and close
[37:47] to the Lord.
[37:50] Oh, it's
[37:56] the love
[37:58] that gives me strength.
[38:02] Oh, from day
[38:05] to day
[38:08] it will never
[38:11] He will never lose
[38:14] his power. One more time as brother
[38:17] comes. Oh,
[38:21] it reaches
[38:23] to the high
[38:26] highest mountain.
[38:30] Thank you Lord.
[38:34] Oh

[39:55] its power.
[39:58] Won't you give the Lord a good hand this
[40:00] morning? I'm glad it'll never lose its
[40:03] power.
[40:04] Never. Never. Never. Never. Never.
[40:07] Hallelujah.
[40:11] Amen. You glad to be in the house of the
[40:13] Lord this morning?
[40:15] &gt;&gt; Isn't he good to us?
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:19] Amen. Thank you, brother Alen, for that
[40:21] this morning. I was thinking as he was
[40:23] given that, you'd have heard brother
[40:26] Homer give that.
[40:29] Some of you old-timers, he could make
[40:31] your toes feel like they were curling
[40:32] under the thing, and you would thought
[40:34] you was all guilty and you wasn't guilty
[40:36] of lick. But Amen. Amen. Was it brother
[40:41] Jim that would say every time brother
[40:44] Homer would preach, he said, "Felt like
[40:46] I the further I put my feet back under
[40:48] the pew,
[40:50] the further brother Homer reached it."
[40:52] So, Amen. And brother Jim Lamb, I
[40:55] believe it was. And Amen. Good to Thank
[40:57] you, brother Alen. And thank all of you.
[41:00] We're a family here.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; We're a family. We certainly love you
[41:05] with all of our hearts.
[41:06] and and uh thank you for everything that
[41:08] you do for the kingdom of God and
[41:11] looking forward to a great meeting and
[41:13] uh we got great preachers coming and and
[41:17] uh we're getting ready for the coming of
[41:18] the Lord.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; If you don't think we're getting ready
[41:21] for the coming of the Lord, they're
[41:24] putting nuclear subs right beside of
[41:26] Russia. All that tells you we got to go
[41:29] home.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; That tells you we got to go home. So we
[41:33] just thank the Lord for that. Amen. and
[41:35] any good to us. And thank you for each
[41:37] and every one of you this morning. Amen.
[41:40] I just have a couple of announcements I
[41:42] want to make. I didn't even ask you this
[41:44] morning if I could do this, but um I
[41:47] know I know sometimes we take things
[41:49] away. If you were, you know, if you're a
[41:51] parent and you want to take things away
[41:53] from your children that they shouldn't
[41:54] be doing, well, I believe in
[41:56] replacement. Give them something back
[41:59] that's good.
[42:00] And so, uh for instance, music. If you
[42:04] don't want them to listen to country and
[42:05] rock, give them good music to listen to.
[42:08] And and if there's things you don't want
[42:10] them to watch, give them good things
[42:11] that you want them to watch. And and uh
[42:15] uh brother Gabriel here is is uh is
[42:18] doing a daily devotional and I've been
[42:20] reading it and listening to it and uh
[42:23] it's on YouTube. It's at Revelations
[42:25] Revelation 10:1. And uh I think you
[42:29] would really enjoy that. That's a good
[42:30] way. Listen, book in your days, reading
[42:33] your Bible and praying. So, devotions is
[42:36] something that you need to do. And so,
[42:38] Brother Gabriel is doing that. Also, if
[42:40] Brother Williams been here for quite a
[42:42] while, and he's been doing this for a
[42:44] while, but I'll just make mention of it
[42:45] again because I sure enjoy it. Visual
[42:47] melodies. He takes us all over the
[42:50] world. And and uh it's good music that
[42:52] goes along with it. And and if you say,
[42:54] "Well, Brother Ron, I want to travel,
[42:55] but I don't have no money." Well,
[42:58] Brother Brother Williams made it so that
[43:01] you can go all over the world and and uh
[43:04] he has it's got some just beautiful uh
[43:07] scenes and settings that are there and
[43:09] music. I didn't ask you cuz I figured
[43:11] you'd tell me no. And so there it is.
[43:14] And so uh we thank God for everything
[43:16] that you do for the kingdom of God. And
[43:19] I I don't know.
[43:21] I didn't make yours public, brother Jim.
[43:23] But Brother Jim sends me and I think he
[43:26] he's shaking his head. know, but brother
[43:28] Jim sends me a quotation every morning
[43:31] from the scriptures and I sure
[43:33] appreciate that if you're on his if
[43:35] you're on his list that he does it. But
[43:37] I think he just sends that one at a time
[43:39] and one at a time and not hundreds at a
[43:41] time. But but I'd like to thank you,
[43:44] brother Jim. And uh each and every one
[43:46] of you that sends me a little something
[43:47] to encourage me, thank you. Thank you.
[43:51] I'll probably get a thousand in the
[43:52] morning, but
[43:57] A guy sent me a note this morning said,
[43:59] "Why don't why aren't you send why are
[44:01] you not send responding to my text?" And
[44:04] I said, "You know, after I get about 50
[44:09] at one time, I cannot respond to every
[44:12] one of them. So, if I don't respond to
[44:14] your text, I'll try to get to you." And
[44:16] so, but we love you with all of our
[44:17] hearts. I'll respond to your text better
[44:19] than I'll respond to your call. So,
[44:21] Amen. Amen. God bless you. We sure love
[44:24] you this morning. If you will turn with
[44:26] me to Matthew chapter 5 and verse 13.
[44:42] Amen. Turn look at your neighbor and
[44:43] say, "I'm glad to be in church with you
[44:45] this morning."
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:50] Amen.
[44:52] See, you can do two things at one time.
[44:56] Matthew chapter 5 and verse 13. This is
[44:59] Jesus speaking in red letter edition for
[45:02] you.
[45:04] You're the salt of the earth. I think
[45:06] it's powerful.
[45:08] This is a powerful statement. Ye are the
[45:11] salt of the earth.
[45:13] But if the salt hath lost its savior,
[45:15] wherewith shall it be salted? It is
[45:18] thenforth good for nothing, but to be
[45:20] cast out and trotten under the foot of
[45:22] men. You are the light of the world, a
[45:25] city that is set on a hill that cannot
[45:27] be hid.
[45:29] Neither do men light a candle and put it
[45:31] under a bushel, but on a candlestick,
[45:34] and it giveth light unto the all that
[45:36] are in the house. Let your light so
[45:39] shine before men, that they may see your
[45:42] good works, and glorify your father
[45:46] which is in heaven.
[45:48] Think not that I am come to destroy the
[45:50] law or the prophets. I am not come to
[45:54] destroy the but to fulfill. That's quite
[45:57] incredible. I'm not come to destroy but
[46:01] fulfill.
[46:02] For verily I say unto you, till heaven
[46:05] and earth pass, one jot or one tit
[46:11] shall in no wise pass from the law till
[46:14] all be fulfilled. Amen. Maybe you have a
[46:17] need on your heart this morning. You
[46:18] just like to say, "Lord, would you
[46:20] please remember me?" Amen. I sure I sure
[46:23] have a need from the Lord. Lord Jesus,
[46:25] we ask you this morning that you'd come
[46:28] among us in a special way. Now, Father,
[46:32] we have great needs. I stand here have a
[46:35] need today. I ask you that you would
[46:37] help us in a special way. Strengthen us,
[46:40] Father. We have needs that you would
[46:42] come by our way. And Father, we're
[46:44] promised. We left our house this
[46:46] morning, drove here some long distance
[46:51] with expectation that you would come by.
[46:54] Now, Father, I invite you to where I'm
[46:56] at. Come and touch us today. We pray in
[47:00] the name of Jesus Christ, we ask you.
[47:03] Amen. And amen and amen. Amen. God bless
[47:05] you this morning. Amen. You can be
[47:07] seated.
[47:09] And the congregation said, "Amen."
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:12] We just returned from brother Tom Rays
[47:15] and the family there and at the meeting
[47:17] and had a wonderful time. Uh these guys
[47:20] did a great job preaching. Matthew just
[47:23] hit a home run.
[47:26] Amen. And so we just of course Andrew
[47:28] did, but we expect that from him.
[47:31] And so
[47:36] I don't know how lunch will be at my
[47:37] house today, but uh
[47:41] but Matthew just hit an absolute home
[47:43] run and we he spoke on friends and it
[47:46] was absolutely great and we sure enjoyed
[47:49] that. And there was a couple bloopers
[47:51] that was in there that made us all come
[47:53] to attention and so if you haven't
[47:55] listened to it, go back and listen to
[47:56] it, catch the bloopers, you'll enjoy it.
[47:59] and and we all enjoyed uh being there.
[48:01] God just did some incredible incredible
[48:04] things. And just to share share one we
[48:08] brother Glenn Grunard has been a friend
[48:10] of mine for many many years and brother
[48:13] Glenn I I didn't know it but brother
[48:15] Glenn had suffered with s his neck a
[48:18] cervical condition and about seven years
[48:22] and he'd just been in incredible pain
[48:24] hadn't been able to sleep on a pillow
[48:27] and so you can imagine what that's been
[48:29] like for the last seven years and so
[48:32] anyways he had went to the doctors and
[48:34] The doctors told him said, "If we
[48:36] operated on it, it's only 50% chance of
[48:39] being able to help you. 50% chance of
[48:44] paralysis being in your body." And so,
[48:47] Brother Glenn said, "Well, I'll just
[48:49] I'll just take my chances and and live
[48:51] with it." During the meeting, um, I
[48:55] called out brother Glenn. Uh, I saw
[48:58] something supernatural there and I
[48:59] called out brother Glenn and I had no
[49:02] idea what was going on. And God 100%
[49:07] healed brother Glenn of that condition.
[49:19] Another that was very probably only a
[49:22] handful of people know this, but uh
[49:24] brother Murphy Wong and his wife was was
[49:27] fellowshipping with us at the end of the
[49:29] meeting on Sunday evening. And so
[49:34] uh she's just a sister Tracy is just a
[49:36] precious a precious lady. And so when we
[49:40] were in China, they they would if we
[49:44] were wiping with a paper towel, they'd
[49:46] come and get that paper towel for prayer
[49:49] cloth. And so, Sister Tracy
[49:53] on Saturday evening had told Brother
[49:55] Murphy said, "Would you would you when
[49:58] Brother Ron gets finished eating, would
[50:01] you get his napkin for me?" And so, you
[50:06] know, somebody else took my tray and and
[50:09] tossed it and she they didn't get a
[50:11] chance for to get my napkin. Of course,
[50:14] I didn't know nothing about it. So,
[50:17] after he we had spent some time in
[50:19] fellowship, he told me he said, "Brother
[50:21] Ron, can I can I have your napkin?"
[50:24] And I thought, "Okay." He said, "Sister
[50:27] Tracy would like to have your napkin as
[50:29] a prayer cloth."
[50:32] And just as he said that, the spirit of
[50:34] the Lord spoke to me. And in my Bible,
[50:38] I carry I carry a very precious uh
[50:43] prayer cloth that was given to me many
[50:46] years ago. And I've carried it and it's
[50:48] been in every sermon that I that I've
[50:50] spoke here. And uh I've carried that
[50:54] prayer cloth that's been sacred to me.
[50:56] You know, some things are sacred to you.
[50:58] And so a voice spoke to me in my ear and
[51:02] said, "Go get your prayer cloth out of
[51:05] your Bible and cut it in two."
[51:10] And so I just I said, "Can you just hold
[51:13] here just for a moment?" And so I ran to
[51:16] my cabin and got my Bible that lays
[51:18] here. And I I pulled a prayer cloth and
[51:21] told them what it meant to me and that
[51:24] that voice had spoke to me and to cut it
[51:26] in two. And as I was cutting in it too
[51:30] and trying to get it to hold still,
[51:32] Sister Connie laid her hand on it.
[51:34] Sister Tracy laid her hand on it.
[51:36] Brother Murphy laid his hand on it. And
[51:39] I begin to cut it in two. And when I cut
[51:42] it in two, the spirit of God dropped,
[51:48] just flooded the place. And I'll have to
[51:52] be honest with you,
[51:54] I hadn't felt it quite like that in a
[51:56] long time. And so I begin to pray with
[52:00] Sister Tracy and I didn't know her
[52:02] needs. Don't know them today, but I just
[52:05] know this that God did a very special
[52:07] thing for us as we sat there. I I
[52:10] believe he'll come where you ask him to
[52:12] come. And so I believe if you will ask
[52:15] him this morning, he'll come to where
[52:17] you're at.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Even right now,
[52:21] Brother Brandham says this. He said
[52:23] Jesus always goes where he is invited.
[52:28] No matter where it's at, he will come.
[52:32] He'll come to a lion's den.
[52:36] One time he said to a fiery furnace. I
[52:39] believe it was David said, "I will make
[52:41] my bed in hell and he will be there."
[52:44] Quite a statement, isn't it? He will
[52:46] come to the poorest, to the richest, to
[52:49] the most immoral, to the meanest, to the
[52:53] lowest.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Is this microphone working?
[53:01] &gt;&gt; He will come to the poorest,
[53:04] &gt;&gt; to the richest,
[53:06] &gt;&gt; to the most immoral,
[53:08] to the meanest, to the lowest. He will
[53:12] come anywhere he's invited.
[53:15] No matter what your conditions and your
[53:17] position in life, he will still come.
[53:20] That makes him God to me. Humble. I will
[53:25] be there. Go to your master. Go tell
[53:28] your master. I will be there. At a such
[53:32] and such date, I will be there. That
[53:34] comes out of meanest man that I know. I
[53:37] would like to speak to you this morning
[53:40] on God bringing order out of chaos.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; This means a whole lot to me this
[53:49] morning and I I've never spoke along
[53:51] this line, but many years ago I had a
[53:55] lung condition because I was burned. And
[53:58] being burned, it scarred my lungs and I
[54:00] was having just continual one right
[54:03] after another infections in my lungs.
[54:06] The doctor said I wouldn't live, but God
[54:09] worked a miracle for us. And we were
[54:11] laying in a in a in a in a in a coma
[54:14] induced coma for quite a while. And I
[54:17] actually later would fly in a plane to
[54:20] Philadelphia to where that the doctor
[54:23] that placed me in the coma, he said,
[54:25] "When I looked and scoped your lungs, he
[54:27] said there was nothing but soot there."
[54:30] And he said, "No way did I expect you to
[54:32] live." and he said, "I watched over your
[54:35] case." He was from Harrisonenberg, "I
[54:38] watched over your case while you was at
[54:40] UVA." And he said, "You're a miracle."
[54:43] By chance. You talk about ch by chance.
[54:47] He actually once we had that
[54:49] conversation, we got on the plane and we
[54:52] had seats right side by side.
[54:56] I don't believe God does anything
[54:59] and by by mistake. And while we was
[55:02] flying in the plane, he we was just
[55:05] about to land. He said, "Ron, would you
[55:07] pray for my mother? I'm going to to see
[55:11] my mother and she's in very bad
[55:12] condition." And he said, "Would you pray
[55:15] for me?" He said, "I need prayers." He
[55:18] said, "I believe you're the real deal."
[55:21] So, so we suffered with that lung
[55:24] condition for about a year and we would
[55:27] go and preach the meeting at Mount Baker
[55:30] where we just spoke at. And when we came
[55:33] back the very next week, Brother
[55:35] Biscllow was at at the North Carolina
[55:38] camp that just happened this week. And
[55:41] and so we were there, Brother Homer and
[55:44] myself and and Connie and Sister Nancy
[55:47] and many of you were sitting in that
[55:49] meeting. And brother Biscoll uses this
[55:52] text. Well, I've actually asked several
[55:55] people, can you find Can you find this
[55:58] sermon on the internet? Can you find it
[56:00] on the internet? Cuz I I asked I asked
[56:03] chat, "Could you find it?" I looked on
[56:05] all different kinds of sites. Where
[56:08] where is that?
[56:10] You'll enjoy this. And so I was telling
[56:13] Brother William about what I was
[56:14] speaking this morning. I said, "You
[56:16] know, I'd look for brother Biscll's
[56:17] sermon, bringing order out of chaos."
[56:19] And I had to look for it and look for it
[56:21] and look for it and couldn't find it.
[56:23] Well, Brother William sent it to me this
[56:25] morning.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; It's on our site.
[56:37] Well, I looked everywhere but our site.
[56:41] And so this evening, Brother William,
[56:42] I'm going to I'm going to listen to it.
[56:44] get didn't get time this morning to
[56:45] listen but and in that sermon brother
[56:49] Biscll is preaching and I'm going to use
[56:51] a couple of things here but brother
[56:53] Biscll is preaching and when he comes
[56:55] down to a certain spot God just inspired
[56:58] me now's your opportunity to stand and I
[57:02] just stood and raised my hands when I
[57:04] stood and raised my hands I put my head
[57:06] back like this and it felt like an
[57:08] oxygen tent came down over top of me and
[57:11] was pressing into my lungs it actually
[57:14] felt like my lungs were going to blow
[57:15] up.
[57:18] And when that left me from that time to
[57:22] this time,
[57:24] I've never had a lung infection again.
[57:27] [Applause]
[57:36] There was a lady that was sitting in a
[57:38] wheelchair
[57:40] about 15 ft from me and she got out of
[57:43] that wheelchair at the same time that I
[57:45] got healed.
[57:51] The prophet of God said, "This world
[57:55] was without form and it was void and
[57:59] darkness was upon the earth and there
[58:02] was nothing but a complete chaos
[58:05] and the world was in that condition
[58:09] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[58:12] face of the water and the entire picture
[58:16] was changed like he said from a total
[58:22] chaos
[58:23] to a garden of Eden.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; That is the transforming power of God
[58:33] that can taste something that's nothing
[58:36] and make something that's wonderful out
[58:39] of it.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; God's transforming power. Yes.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Genesis 1 said, "In the beginning, God
[58:48] created the heaven and the earth." And
[58:51] notice these next verse, chapter 2,
[58:54] verse two, "And the earth was without
[58:57] form, and void, and darkness was upon
[59:02] the face of the deep,
[59:04] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[59:07] face of the water. And God and God said,
[59:11] "Let there be light."
[59:14] And there was light.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Listen, it wasn't some big boom
[59:19] somewhere or another.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; It wasn't some Darwin theory.
[59:27] God created the heavens and the earth.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; God created the heavens and the earth.
[59:34] Brother Brandham said that the earth was
[59:36] like a ball of ice.
[59:39] And it says that God be to move it near
[59:42] the sun and it begin to melt. And out of
[59:46] all of that chaos
[59:49] &gt;&gt; out of that without form or void,
[59:54] totally useless,
[59:56] God be to work.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; God be to work. And if we could, all of
[1:00:03] us would like to go to the Garden of
[1:00:05] Eden.
[1:00:06] God begin to work. And it began be begin
[1:00:10] to be a perfect harmony of what God had
[1:00:14] in his mind.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Then not going to stay here, but Adam,
[1:00:20] God made Adam in spirit form to rule
[1:00:25] and to keep the Garden of Eden
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; because remember chaos was all over the
[1:00:31] earth except
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; except for the Garden of Eden. and he
[1:00:37] was watching over it.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Let me just say it's just like your
[1:00:42] life. Our lives was without form.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; And we were void without God in our
[1:00:49] lives.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; The scripture says in Isaiah 55 and
[1:00:55] verse 6, "Seek ye the Lord while he may
[1:00:59] be found.
[1:01:01] Call upon him while he is near." Let me
[1:01:05] just say if you feel the spirit of God
[1:01:08] come near to you in a service, take
[1:01:11] advantage.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; If you feel the spirit of God come near
[1:01:16] to you in a service, don't miss your
[1:01:19] opportunity.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Don't miss your opportunity, brother.
[1:01:26] But I've walked to the altar many times.
[1:01:29] When he is near,
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; when he is near, you want to capture
[1:01:34] that opportunity.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Don't miss it.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; I know of people that missed their
[1:01:43] opportunity.
[1:01:45] And and one in particular told me, he
[1:01:47] said, "It was decades before I felt that
[1:01:50] again.
[1:01:54] I don't want to waste I don't want to
[1:01:56] waste a day. I don't want to waste a
[1:01:58] year, much less 20 years.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Let the wicked forsake his way,
[1:02:05] the unrighteous man his thoughts, and
[1:02:08] let him return unto the Lord, and he
[1:02:11] will have mercy upon him. And to our
[1:02:14] God, he will abundantly
[1:02:18] pardon.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Not man pardon, God pardon.
[1:02:25] Man will remember.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Man will hold it against you.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Man can't keep a secret.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Man will always bring it up at an odd
[1:02:40] time. But God puts it in the sea of
[1:02:43] forgetfulness.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; He puts it in the sea of forgiveness and
[1:02:48] he never brings it up to you again.
[1:02:52] your memory will or another person will,
[1:02:55] but God never brings it up.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; You can shout all you want to right
[1:03:01] there.
[1:03:10] Notice this. For my thoughts
[1:03:12] are not your thoughts, neither are your
[1:03:16] ways my ways, sayeth the Lord. For as
[1:03:19] the heavens are higher than the earth,
[1:03:22] so are my ways higher than your ways,
[1:03:25] and my thoughts than your thoughts.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; And he said he, brother Brandham's
[1:03:31] speaking now. He said, he that cometh
[1:03:33] unto me, I will in no wise cast out.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; He said, I believe it once coming under
[1:03:42] the blood, take his word for anything
[1:03:46] that he says. Amen.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Every believer, here it is. Get it?
[1:03:53] Every man or woman that has once been
[1:03:57] brought under the blood of Christ,
[1:04:00] all fear and condemnation is gone.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Bringing order to the chaos.
[1:04:12] Once under the blood, brought under the
[1:04:14] blood of Christ,
[1:04:16] all fear and condemnation is gone.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; I think it's so important. I I want you
[1:04:25] to I want you to catch it.
[1:04:28] Once brought under the blood of Christ,
[1:04:30] let's say that together. Once brought
[1:04:33] under the blood of Christ,
[1:04:36] all fear and condemnation
[1:04:39] is gone.
[1:04:44] Then he will believe every word that God
[1:04:48] writes in the Bible to the truth.
[1:04:52] He will not say this is not inspired and
[1:04:55] that's not inspired. But he said every
[1:04:58] word
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; every word come to the fountain of and
[1:05:03] that is filled with blood drawn from
[1:05:06] Emanuel's brain. Oh, what a wonderful
[1:05:09] savior that we have. What a plan of
[1:05:12] redemption. Jehovah alone lotted out for
[1:05:16] us, laid out the carpet for us to come
[1:05:20] home.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; There's always a coming home. And
[1:05:26] there's nothing like a coming home.
[1:05:29] Amen.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says the world was without
[1:05:33] form and it was void and darkness was
[1:05:35] upon the face of the earth. Nothing but
[1:05:38] a complete chaos
[1:05:41] and this world was in that condition and
[1:05:44] the spirit of God moved upon it upon the
[1:05:47] face. He says and then that entire
[1:05:50] picture changed.
[1:05:52] Brother Ron you just read that but I
[1:05:54] want you to get it. That is the
[1:05:57] transforming power of God.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; This quote's a bit lengthy, but I I want
[1:06:08] I want to drop it to you here. Is
[1:06:11] everybody okay to learn to look over to
[1:06:13] your neighbor?
[1:06:16] This comes out of the church age book.
[1:06:25] He says, "But now he is standing in the
[1:06:27] midst of the church."
[1:06:29] You know, he was in the midst of the
[1:06:31] seven candlesticks.
[1:06:33] And as he stands there revealing who it
[1:06:35] is in the last age, he calls himself the
[1:06:39] author of the creation of God.
[1:06:44] And he said, "This is not another
[1:06:46] creation
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; that has to do with the church. This is
[1:06:50] a special designation of himself.
[1:06:54] He is the creator of that church.
[1:07:00] The heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:07:03] bride.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He's talking about you.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; He that created the earth created you.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; And you're a special designation of
[1:07:16] people. Oh, brother. just felt it and I
[1:07:19] came. Let me just say, no man can come
[1:07:22] unless the spirit of God draws him.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; We wasn't looking for God.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; We were happy about what we were doing,
[1:07:36] but God rich in mercy
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; came looking for you. Listen,
[1:07:48] it wasn't no I did, I did, I did. He He
[1:07:52] is He is what we have.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I can do nothing except my
[1:07:58] father shows me first." And if Jesus
[1:08:00] couldn't,
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; that's the spirit of God. He came down
[1:08:10] and created
[1:08:12] in the Virgin Mary the cells from which
[1:08:16] his body was born. He said, I want to
[1:08:19] repeat that
[1:08:21] he created the very cells in the womb of
[1:08:24] Mary for that body.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; It was not enough for the Holy Spirit to
[1:08:29] simply give life to a human over him
[1:08:33] supplied by Mary. That would have been
[1:08:36] sinful mankind producing a body that
[1:08:39] would have not produced the last Adam
[1:08:44] of him as it was said low a body thou
[1:08:48] the father prepared for me God not Mary
[1:08:53] prepared pro provided that body Mary was
[1:08:57] the human incubator and she carried that
[1:09:01] holy child and brought him to birth it
[1:09:04] was a God man.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It was a God man. He
[1:09:11] was the son of God. He was the new
[1:09:14] creation. The first Adam fell.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; But this Adam won't fall.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Man and God met and joined. He was the
[1:09:27] first of a new race. He is the head of
[1:09:30] the new race. 1 Corinthians 1:18. He is
[1:09:33] the head of the body, the church, who is
[1:09:37] the beginning,
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; the firstborn from the dead, that in all
[1:09:43] things he might have the preeminence.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 17.
[1:09:52] Therefore, if any man be in Christ,
[1:09:55] notice these words. Therefore, if any
[1:09:57] man be in Christ, he is a new creature.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:04] He is a new creation
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; cuz no man can do that. This is not
[1:10:11] about reformation.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; This is not about creating a new vow.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; We need God
[1:10:20] in his new creation
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; to come and sweep into our lives.
[1:10:28] Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he
[1:10:31] is a new creation.
[1:10:33] Old things have passed away.
[1:10:36] Behold, all things are become new.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; You're talking about bringing order to
[1:10:44] chaos.
[1:10:46] Before I go any further, our lives were
[1:10:49] just chaos.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; If a man's without Christ, this is
[1:10:55] chaos.
[1:10:58] Brother Ron, it didn't look like chaos
[1:11:00] to me. I was the life of the party. You
[1:11:02] were on your way to hell.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You were on your way to
[1:11:10] hell. You didn't know you had a
[1:11:12] predestinated seed that was coming to
[1:11:13] get you.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You were you were you
[1:11:18] were enjoying bud or you were enjoying
[1:11:21] cars or you enjoying a cigarette or you
[1:11:24] were enjoying sports teams or you were
[1:11:27] enjoying this or that.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; You're enjoying all of the things of the
[1:11:33] world.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Listen, there's no eternal life to that.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; There's no eternal life to seeing and
[1:11:44] fox.
[1:11:46] There's no eternal life to all of the
[1:11:48] education of the world. There's nothing
[1:11:50] there.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Well, I I I'm a I'm a Washington fan. No
[1:11:56] eternal life to that. I'm a Cowboy fan.
[1:11:59] There's no eternal life to that.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's just entertainment.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; We were we were chasing after things
[1:12:10] that was very temporal. People
[1:12:13] sit in prisons now that'll spend the
[1:12:16] rest of their life because they had a
[1:12:18] bad day
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; or they got under the influence of a
[1:12:21] certain thing.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; But God, rich in mercy, watched over
[1:12:26] your life
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; and guided you so that you wouldn't be
[1:12:32] in there.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; You could sit here this morning.
[1:12:37] [Applause]
[1:12:48] Some of you were a Methodist.
[1:12:51] My mother was a Methodist.
[1:12:58] My father told her, said, "We're going
[1:13:00] to have to break up because
[1:13:03] you know you being a Methodist, you
[1:13:05] won't believe this."
[1:13:06] She said, "Charlie,
[1:13:08] you need to give me a chance.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; You need to give me a chance at the
[1:13:14] word." Listen, I've heard this story so
[1:13:16] many times. You need to listen. My
[1:13:19] mother was a beautiful woman. She had
[1:13:21] been a cheerleader.
[1:13:23] And I'm not telling you she was
[1:13:24] beautiful because she was, but she was
[1:13:27] voted the most beautiful in her class.
[1:13:30] She could have done a lot of things in
[1:13:31] life.
[1:13:33] She was the life of the party.
[1:13:36] But here she meets this guy
[1:13:38] predestinated.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Predestinated.
[1:13:43] And so my father told my grandmother
[1:13:47] that she was a beautiful woman.
[1:13:50] He worked with her. She said, "If you
[1:13:52] think I'm beautiful, you ought to meet
[1:13:54] my daughter."
[1:13:56] So he met her daughter and that daughter
[1:13:58] become his wife. Hallelujah.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; And I was born 9 hours, 9 months and two
[1:14:05] hours later
[1:14:07] after they got married.
[1:14:11] They called him Lightning.
[1:14:22] I don't care how they called him. I am
[1:14:24] glad I'm here.
[1:14:32] But when she heard the word, she went
[1:14:35] back to her Methodist church and she
[1:14:36] said, "I'll no longer be here.
[1:14:41] I believe a message."
[1:14:46] And they said, "You'll go to hell
[1:14:49] leaving the Methodist church." Well, it
[1:14:52] didn't work out like that.
[1:14:56] It didn't work out like that. Maybe you
[1:14:58] were in the Baptist. Maybe you were in
[1:15:00] the Amish and they come and said, "But
[1:15:02] you're leaving our order.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; You're leaving the Catholic order, or
[1:15:07] you're leaving that order." No. God was
[1:15:10] bringing order to your chaos.
[1:15:23] And let me just tell you about that
[1:15:25] chaos. You didn't even know how many
[1:15:27] gods there were.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; You couldn't explain Godhead. 321.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; You didn't know how to be baptized in
[1:15:38] many of those organizations.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? were married to the
[1:15:43] church. They felt like that was okay.
[1:15:45] You were you had your name on the book,
[1:15:47] but God was telling you, there's another
[1:15:50] book.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; I wrote your name down before the
[1:15:54] foundation of the world.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; It's not in some book down here that can
[1:15:58] be burned up.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; It's not in there some church that's 100
[1:16:03] foot wide and 200 foot deep. You're the
[1:16:06] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:09] You're not some church member. You're
[1:16:12] the bride.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; I slipped the wedding band of
[1:16:23] predestinated grace on you before the
[1:16:27] foundation of the world.
[1:16:30] That ought to be enough to shout about.
[1:16:41] Hallelujah.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; I redeemed you. Not some man did it. I
[1:16:46] redeemed you.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; I saved you.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; We needed a prophet
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; to bring order to our chaos.
[1:17:01] [Applause]
[1:17:03] We needed an Apostle Paul to write the
[1:17:06] first the New Testament
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; to bring order.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Trying to behave
[1:17:21] not going to behave much longer here.
[1:17:25] So now we go back to that scripture 2
[1:17:28] Corinthians 5 and verse 17.
[1:17:31] Therefore, if any man,
[1:17:34] woman, boy or girl,
[1:17:37] be in Christ,
[1:17:40] he is a new creation.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Old things have passed away, and behold,
[1:17:46] all things are become new.
[1:17:51] There you can see that through that that
[1:17:54] man of that old order of creation now in
[1:17:59] the union with Christ he has become new
[1:18:03] creation.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10. For if
[1:18:11] for we are his workmanship,
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; created in union with Christ Jesus under
[1:18:22] good works. Ephesians 4 and verse 24.
[1:18:25] And that ye have put on a new man which
[1:18:28] is after God created in righteousness
[1:18:30] and true holiness. The new creation is
[1:18:35] not the old creation made over.
[1:18:39] You're not bringing the old things over
[1:18:41] to the new.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; That's dead.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; I met the old Stephanie.
[1:18:51] And she was coming here for a man and
[1:18:53] she got one. Jesus.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Just happened. Jerry went along with it.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I met many of you under
[1:19:05] the old creation.
[1:19:08] But under the new,
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; under the new, it becomes a new world
[1:19:17] order. And I'm not talking about this
[1:19:18] nonsense of politics.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; The new creation is not the old made
[1:19:24] over
[1:19:26] or it could be called or it could not be
[1:19:29] called a new creation. That is exactly
[1:19:31] what it is. It's not the old one patched
[1:19:34] up.
[1:19:43] I was I cut my arm the other day
[1:19:47] and we were we were out and and this guy
[1:19:50] brought a first aid kit and so I have
[1:19:54] condition in my arms to where the the
[1:19:57] cancer is real close to the skin. So so
[1:20:00] it makes my arms bleed. At first, we
[1:20:02] thought it was because we were taking
[1:20:03] thinners
[1:20:05] and that was part of it, but but the
[1:20:09] cancer has come real close to the skin
[1:20:11] because it's skin cancer and so it'll
[1:20:13] just bust at any time. You don't have to
[1:20:15] hit it. It's all the time busting. And
[1:20:17] and so
[1:20:19] we get blood in the bed. We got blood in
[1:20:21] the bed and we have to take sheets off
[1:20:23] and Conniey's a trooper. She said, "No
[1:20:25] problem. No problem." And I'll get blood
[1:20:27] all over all over the place. And so this
[1:20:30] guy, he saw all the band-aids on my arm
[1:20:33] and he said, "You're a patched up guy."
[1:20:37] He said, "I'm going to put a few more
[1:20:39] patches on you." And I thought, "No, not
[1:20:41] in here. I'm not patched up.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Not in here. I may be patched up on the
[1:20:47] outside, but on the inside,
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; on the inside of me, I'm not patched up.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; God did a new thing on the inside of me.
[1:21:05] Brother Stephen, you absorb the word so
[1:21:08] well. But I I just want to drop this to
[1:21:10] you. There'll come a time in your life
[1:21:12] you don't remember the old guy.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, you'll go, I'm not even
[1:21:17] like the old guy
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; because you're new.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; And you and the old guy are no longer
[1:21:25] the same.
[1:21:34] There's a lot of funerals that we go to,
[1:21:37] but the most closest funeral that you'll
[1:21:40] ever go to is the death of an old
[1:21:43] friend. You.
[1:21:47] And when you bury that guy,
[1:21:50] and I'm talking about truly burying him,
[1:21:54] he's dead.
[1:21:56] And when he dies,
[1:21:59] you're no longer that guy.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; He used to have habits that you no
[1:22:04] longer have.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Help me now.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; He used to have addictions that you no
[1:22:09] longer have. He used to read things that
[1:22:12] you no longer read. He used to listen to
[1:22:15] things that you no longer listen to.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:21] Because the new man is born. And when
[1:22:24] he's born, he drives that old man out.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; The new man won't come until the old one
[1:22:30] is gone.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; God's not an adulterer. He won't live
[1:22:34] with another head. That first one's got
[1:22:37] to die.
[1:22:49] Now,
[1:22:52] we've got some cancer patients here.
[1:22:58] And I'm just going to get off off my
[1:23:00] notes here for a moment. It's in my
[1:23:02] notes, but it'll take too long to go
[1:23:04] through them.
[1:23:06] But cancer, brother Brandham was so far
[1:23:08] ahead
[1:23:10] and doctors actually learned from him.
[1:23:13] But I fought cancer now five and a half
[1:23:15] years and they have proved the message
[1:23:18] right.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; They proved the message right.
[1:23:24] And so cancer is like a crab. It's under
[1:23:29] the sign of the crab.
[1:23:31] And cancer will will take on the life of
[1:23:34] itself.
[1:23:37] And so, Brother Brandham said it comes
[1:23:40] from a bruised cell
[1:23:44] and it'll live on the life of that cell
[1:23:47] and it'll start living on the lives of
[1:23:49] other cells and it begins to kill those
[1:23:52] cells. It's like Satan. Satan can't per
[1:23:56] he can't create so he perverts. Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; He'll take truth and pervert it.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; See, man will pollute.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; You can always find out about men and
[1:24:11] what they are.
[1:24:14] Archaeologists try to find trash piles
[1:24:19] because they learn from trash piles
[1:24:23] because in the trash piles, it'll tell
[1:24:25] them what they ate. It'll tell them
[1:24:28] their jobs.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; If you want to steal somebody's
[1:24:33] identity, go to the trash pile.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not telling nobody to do that.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Because in your
[1:24:42] trash pile, it'll show what you were.
[1:24:45] Right.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; So those cells that are in your body
[1:24:51] that are backsliding, Brother Brandham
[1:24:53] said cancer will get in them
[1:24:57] and will live off of your life.
[1:25:02] Brother Brandon said cancer will hide
[1:25:04] from that light.
[1:25:07] It'll hide from the light.
[1:25:12] And maybe you say, "Well, I don't
[1:25:14] believe that." Okay.
[1:25:17] So, what will happen is they'll start
[1:25:20] doing biopsies
[1:25:22] and in the biopsy
[1:25:25] they'll go in there and they'll they'll
[1:25:27] see that that cell and they'll go to
[1:25:30] prick it and all of a sudden that cell
[1:25:33] will hide.
[1:25:36] How you know? because I've sat and laid
[1:25:40] while they're working on me. And the
[1:25:43] doctors will be servable doctors will be
[1:25:46] working on you and they'll go to prick
[1:25:48] the cell and all of a sudden it
[1:25:49] disappears
[1:25:53] and they'll say, "We know that's cancer.
[1:25:56] We'll just wait for it to pop back up."
[1:25:58] So they'll wait. They may wait five
[1:26:00] minutes. There it is. Boop.
[1:26:04] And pop it back up. and they'll they'll
[1:26:06] dream from it and they'll go that
[1:26:10] you'll go and get a clean scan and that
[1:26:13] clean scan will show there's nothing
[1:26:14] there and you go hallelujah glory to the
[1:26:17] lamb and they'll say wait till next time
[1:26:20] and we'll see if he was hiding.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, brother? Aren't you
[1:26:29] thankful for the clean stand? Yeah. And
[1:26:31] I want to get hundreds of them.
[1:26:34] I want to get hundreds of them. Are you
[1:26:36] with me now?
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; But that devil will try to hide.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Not just in cancer.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; He'll try to hide in your lustful life.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; And he'll lay there and try to hide. And
[1:26:47] then years later, he'll want to pop back
[1:26:49] up. Kill it.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Keep taking the word of God. God spoke
[1:26:56] to a world that was without form and
[1:26:58] void. How did he bring it to order? He
[1:27:01] spoke to it. Amen.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; He spoke to the word of God. That's how
[1:27:08] we get faith. Faith cometh by hearing
[1:27:11] and hearing by the word of God.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I'm having a good day.
[1:27:20] Good.
[1:27:21] But you can't defeat your enemy with a
[1:27:24] good day.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; You got to take the word of God and
[1:27:27] constantly keep it before him.
[1:27:42] He said, "Cancer is one of the great
[1:27:43] killers.
[1:27:45] Cancer has a life. It's another life
[1:27:49] beside your life. It's growing and it's
[1:27:51] spreading." The Bible calls it a devil.
[1:27:57] Cancer is called by a medical name the
[1:28:00] word crab with legs and spreading out.
[1:28:03] But the real term of it, it's a devil.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; It's a tormentor.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; And it's set in your body and it comes
[1:28:15] from a little cell that's been bruised.
[1:28:18] Usually a little cell backslider cannot
[1:28:21] cause your life. But in a big word for a
[1:28:27] a big word for a Baptist to say a
[1:28:29] backslider.
[1:28:32] He said, "But just the same when a cell
[1:28:35] backslides, it'll interrupt every cell
[1:28:38] in your body.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; If the devil can get into that little
[1:28:42] cell, now the devil cannot create, he
[1:28:46] cannot create one thing. He can only
[1:28:48] pervert
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; what God has already created.
[1:28:54] Sin is righteousness
[1:28:58] perverted.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Sin is nothing. The devil couldn't even
[1:29:05] create sin.
[1:29:09] Think about that.
[1:29:12] He comes down to another place in God's
[1:29:14] power to transform. He said, he said,
[1:29:17] "If that isn't a picture of the world
[1:29:18] today where Satan is spreading, spraying
[1:29:22] his unbelief, his hybrid, his science,
[1:29:25] his knowledge until what it was at the
[1:29:29] beginning when God and when God put Adam
[1:29:32] and Eve in the earth, what a beautiful
[1:29:34] paradise without death, without
[1:29:36] sickness, without sorrow, everything in
[1:29:39] perfect order." And look what Satan did.
[1:29:47] Listen, if we just stayed in the Garden
[1:29:48] of Eden and Perfect, there had never
[1:29:50] been a dead baby.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; There had never been one cancer patient.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, there wouldn't even
[1:29:57] been a hospital built.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; There wouldn't have been a need for
[1:30:01] police.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, what do you think about
[1:30:08] this defund the police?
[1:30:12] That's what they're going to do here.
[1:30:14] I'm moving.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; But let me just tell you something about
[1:30:24] defunding police. This is how you do it.
[1:30:27] Gabe, you can you can straighten me out
[1:30:29] after service.
[1:30:32] So was a man named Feny
[1:30:36] and there was a phenomenal revival broke
[1:30:38] out
[1:30:39] and brother Random says that 97%
[1:30:43] of Feny's converts held
[1:30:46] and he said he preached with such
[1:30:48] conviction
[1:30:51] but Lonzo he he preached to where that
[1:30:53] men five miles away would drop their
[1:30:57] lunchboxes and give their heart to Jesus
[1:31:00] Christ. Hey, listen. I'm not I'm not
[1:31:03] wishing for five miles away, although
[1:31:05] it'd be nice, but I'd like for it to go
[1:31:07] to the back of the building.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; You know, I want this building to be
[1:31:13] consumed with the presence of God.
[1:31:16] That's what I pray for in every service.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; I believe, let me just stop here. I
[1:31:28] believe you drive too far, whether it's
[1:31:31] 30 minutes or an hour or two hours, you
[1:31:34] drive too far to come here
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; and just sit through a service.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; I believe we come here with an
[1:31:43] expectation.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Ron, I've had a bad day.
[1:31:53] Put it behind you.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; I've got a tough week coming up. Let me
[1:31:58] just say get just put all that aside.
[1:32:02] This is the most important day of your
[1:32:04] week.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil rob you.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; And Finny preached with that atmosphere.
[1:32:18] I'll tell you what happened to
[1:32:19] Rochester, New York.
[1:32:22] So many got saved that the police didn't
[1:32:25] have nothing to do.
[1:32:31] jails emptied out.
[1:32:34] That's a good defund the police.
[1:32:37] How many of you ever heard for the
[1:32:38] barbershop quartet?
[1:32:43] You guys live under a rock?
[1:32:48] I'm g say it again. How many ever heard
[1:32:50] of the barbershop quartets?
[1:32:54] Well, they were actually not barbershop
[1:32:56] haircut cutters. They were police
[1:32:58] officers
[1:33:00] that traveled all over Rochester and
[1:33:03] sang gospel hymns
[1:33:05] cuz they didn't have to take care of the
[1:33:07] town cuz they were a Christian society.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Not making something up here. That's how
[1:33:14] you define it.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; We're going to a land.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; We're going to a new Jerusalem.
[1:33:23] where Jesus Christ is the king over it.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; No hospitals.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. No rehab centers.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; He's calling the chaos of this life to
[1:33:39] an order.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; To a real order.
[1:33:48] [Applause]
[1:33:52] Amen.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; What happened that night in North
[1:33:55] Carolina? All of that, all of that chaos
[1:33:58] in my lungs, the word.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; The word
[1:34:06] called this body to an order.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; How do you know? One of the doctors that
[1:34:14] was examining my lungs with cancer now
[1:34:18] said, "If your lungs wasn't so perfect,
[1:34:21] you'd have never survived this."
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; I didn't go back and tell him about a
[1:34:28] night in North Carolina, but I sat there
[1:34:30] and thought, if God hadn't performed
[1:34:33] that miracle,
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; he couldn't perform this miracle.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:43] What about your miracle,
[1:34:49] brother Ron? My life is in chaos. Let me
[1:34:52] just say there's one in this building.
[1:35:02] Hallelujah.
[1:35:07] I have new men in financial
[1:35:09] difficulties,
[1:35:11] horrible financial difficulties.
[1:35:14] When God came into their life, he
[1:35:16] changed their lives.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Listen, God's a banker.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; It's not a God's a banker.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? And take this
[1:35:30] correctly. There's people that have went
[1:35:32] to all kind of psychologists. This word
[1:35:35] is a is a psychologist.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; He knows how to take your anxiety and
[1:35:41] bring you to a peace.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; I think there's a lot of times we're at
[1:35:47] war within ourselves. Let that war.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Let that war bring you to a peace. Let
[1:35:56] the war dissolve and let it go somewhere
[1:35:59] else. live in peace.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; I think that's a phenomenal statement
[1:36:08] that you can live in peace.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Your family can live in peace.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:36:17] My wife said something to me yesterday.
[1:36:20] You didn't think I was going to use it?
[1:36:26] She said, "I'm ever amazed."
[1:36:28] We were having dinner.
[1:36:31] She said, "I'm ever amazed.
[1:36:34] We got We got children. We got
[1:36:37] daughter-in-laws. We got grandchildren."
[1:36:42] And she said, "I've never had a falling
[1:36:44] out with them.
[1:36:48] Never had a fall." Listen, when you're
[1:36:50] at peace,
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; you don't have to have fallings out.
[1:36:55] You can have differences.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; What kind of differences? Chocolate and
[1:37:01] vanilla.
[1:37:04] [Applause]
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; But if you mix them both together, it
[1:37:10] comes out real good.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm on such and such diet. Listen,
[1:37:17] if you you'll find something on the
[1:37:18] table.
[1:37:22] But listen, our homes can be at peace.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Our jobs,
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; but brother Ron, I live with a bunch of
[1:37:31] buzzards. I I I I have to work with
[1:37:34] buzzards. Be an eagle.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; And an eagle is an eagle no matter where
[1:37:40] it's at.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Rise above your storms.
[1:37:53] We celebrate anniversaries and
[1:37:55] birthdays.
[1:37:57] I know you do. I get your notices. Come
[1:38:00] to my birthday party.
[1:38:02] That's That's good. Don't be mad at me
[1:38:04] if I don't.
[1:38:06] But please don't be mad at me if I
[1:38:08] don't.
[1:38:11] And I'm glad you're celebrating and you
[1:38:13] got another one. you're not dead.
[1:38:16] Or I'd have done preached your funeral.
[1:38:19] I'd have tried to find something good to
[1:38:20] say.
[1:38:27] If you work long enough, you'll find
[1:38:28] something.
[1:38:45] Where was I at, Matthew?
[1:38:52] No, I was somewhere before that.
[1:39:02] I worked at the Arsenal for 11 years in
[1:39:06] nitroglycerin.
[1:39:08] This is where I was going.
[1:39:14] When I arrived,
[1:39:18] we worked in nitroglycerin. You know
[1:39:20] what they do? Nitroglycerin blows up.
[1:39:24] Takes people's lives.
[1:39:28] When I arrived,
[1:39:30] they were some of the biggest cussers
[1:39:33] that I'd ever met.
[1:39:36] I don't do that.
[1:39:40] There was
[1:39:42] there was pictures in every locker
[1:39:46] that I don't look at.
[1:39:52] They had religion that didn't live.
[1:39:57] I didn't go in preaching.
[1:40:00] I went in living.
[1:40:03] Before I was gone,
[1:40:06] there were times when there was nothing
[1:40:07] to do. They would say, "Preach."
[1:40:12] And I jump up on a table that was about
[1:40:15] that tall. Somebody help me.
[1:40:19] I jump up on that table. It was a long
[1:40:21] table. And I would stand there and
[1:40:23] preach to them this gospel.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Listen. Then got word to the
[1:40:29] headquarters. And they came to hear me
[1:40:32] preach.
[1:40:34] We never started a shift without prayer.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Where did it start? Living a sermon.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Many times I got out
[1:40:47] and and we would get alone cuz there was
[1:40:49] 7,500 buildings. And listen, I would
[1:40:53] meet them and they say, "Preacher, I
[1:40:54] need you to pray with me." got down on
[1:40:56] my knees and prayed
[1:40:59] with them.
[1:41:02] Over 60 people came to my father's
[1:41:04] church while I was there. I would invite
[1:41:07] them to come. Over 60 came. This message
[1:41:12] can be lived. Don't tell me it can't.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? When I left, it was
[1:41:18] like a death that was happening that I
[1:41:22] was leaving.
[1:41:24] One of my bosses said, "Who's going to
[1:41:26] live it now?"
[1:41:29] That man would later commit suicide.
[1:41:32] Who's going to live it now? And I told
[1:41:35] him, "You can."
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, my world is in chaos.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Then let it be changed by the power of
[1:41:44] God.
[1:41:50] Brother Chris, you own your own
[1:41:52] business. You've owned it for years.
[1:41:56] You don't have time to preach people a
[1:41:57] sermon.
[1:41:59] But you can live it.
[1:42:02] You can live it. Some of these guys work
[1:42:04] here for you. You can live a sermon.
[1:42:08] Listen, it don't take long to be around
[1:42:10] you to know you're a Christian.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; I can say that about you. you you're a
[1:42:16] Christian. Listen, and you don't have to
[1:42:18] say anything.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; It's because the chaos in your life now
[1:42:23] has been brought to order.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me there wasn't chaos at one
[1:42:28] time, cuz there was. Listen. And God
[1:42:31] brings that to order.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; And now others can share the benefits.
[1:42:41] Here
[1:42:49] you sit on the front pew.
[1:42:52] I'm glad to see that.
[1:42:54] I'm glad to see that. A few years ago,
[1:42:57] you didn't know nothing about this.
[1:42:59] Ain't it, right? But now, God is day by
[1:43:04] day bringing your life to order. Are you
[1:43:07] with me? There's a lot of benefits that
[1:43:09] goes with this.
[1:43:12] Ain't that right? And you don't just
[1:43:14] feel it on Sunday, but Monday and
[1:43:16] Tuesday and Wednesday, it lives in your
[1:43:18] life. Will I fail? Sure, you'll fail.
[1:43:21] But there's a God that'll lift you back
[1:43:23] up.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; He'll lift you back up. He'll draw
[1:43:28] strength to you.
