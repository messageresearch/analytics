last night we partied so hard I thought we turn the house down what a wonderful church service we had last night all those people that were healed it was like nothing ever seen before it was so great I know I've never heard of this man before and that Reverend brandham he was something real special yes tell me about that it's amazing what God can do do in our lives and yes it is hey look at that last night was cold is he [Music] okay I don't think so he's not breathing uh what's he doing with that old dirty doll it looks like he was trying to give it to someone I recognized this man he he was walking the streets yesterday and and talking to himself it looks like he was going to give that dirty little doll to his daughter I knew him too his little girl went to school with my kids but she died recently this is the only way he could keep his promise isn't Christmas really supposed to be about love thank you wait you were Angels this whole time the lord gave me a way to get this doll for my daughter and now he's giving me a way to bring it to her thank you thank you thank you Mary Sarah I'm [Music] coming too long sorry than you sir for [Music] daddy you kept your promise thank you for the gift of course they found the old man and when he turned him over he had little dog next to his heart I suppose he took his gift to of her he found her in a land not here he he he took the gift it was an appropriate gift amen God merciful yet it cost him his death there's no other way in the world he could have give her the gift she was buing amen but the only way he could do it would be go like that amen little doll didn't mean too much I guess a little dirty face doll but it what did he do it it fulfilled a promise he had made amen no wonder what the people thought about it his dirty hands and a little dirty dog but it fulfilled a promise to his little girl sometimes they look upon the gospel the same thing they didn't want it when God brought it but it fulfilled a promise amen that he would give his son you know what they left him to die too just like a on the street exactly right they left him to die like a on the street and today they they treat him like a trap on the street amen amen but he fulfilled what he was supposed to do he was the gift that God promised to the world tonight let me take him as my Sav to my heart let me walk into the face of my death or whatever it is like amen I promise my life to him I want to take it to him no matter why I have to go if I have go through death and I have to be shot no matter what takes place I have to be laughed at call crazy everything got communicate the rest of the Christian churches and so forth uh it's the gift of God that I hold in my heart he I want to take it to him that's just appropriate gifts I speak on it was appropriate gift because the little girl she was a little girl to be her mother would have been an appropriate gift was a little doll an appropriate gift that God the Creator could give to his creation would be a Sav just save it from the condition it was in I wonder tonight as we are approaching Christmas now and I suppose it be the last message we hear between now and Christmas Les we get the radio messages somewhere I wonder tonight if we've accepted the gift that God promised us eternal life through Believing on Christ and receiving the Holy Spirit [Music] the Gul that separat me from Christ my Lord it was so vast the cross sing I could never fall from where I was to his domain it seems so far I cried dear Lord I canot come to where you are he came to [Music] me he came to me when I could not come to where he was he came to me that why he died oh in calary when I could not come to where he was he came to [Music] me he came to me when I was bound in Chains of [Music] s he came to me when I possessed last no hope with [Applause] him he picked me up and Drew Me Gently to his side where today in his we love and now AB about he came to me he came to me when I could not come to where where he was he came to [Music] me that's why he died oh [Music] calary when I could not come to where he was he came to [Music] me [Applause] [Music] aren't you thankful aren't you thankful that he came to you 2,000 years ago in times very much like these the busyness of Life had crept in on the city of Bethlehem streets were filled with people Downing the government ridiculing the new tax laws concerned about the impact of current and present state affairs but the world did not realize how great a gift was truly coming that it would be these little feet in a Manger who would tread upon the Serpent's neck and he would crush his feet crush his head it was searched out by those that were in need but none could find place for this gift it wasn't that the gift that was coming was too big in size that it couldn't be accepted but that men were refusing to house the greatest present unwrapping that would ever take place in humanity there was no room then and I hate to say it there's very little room for him now you see God can use every faculty of our being if it's committed and surrendered to him he can use our mind our dreams our subconscious our first conscious our tongue our songs our eyes everything that we have can be used of God if it's committed to God you see everything that you are committed to God he'll use every outlet and every part of you he'll use it no matter what it is he'll use it if it's Sanctified to his purpose and his calling you see when Jesus was a child of around 2 years old there were wise men that came and they'd found the holy child that they had been in search for ever since that the star appeared and when they got to a great big city of Jerusalem and they got on the outside of that City and the star appeared again the Bible records that they rejoiced with exceeding great joy because they had found the star that would lead them to the Christ child they brought him gold they brought him frankincense and they brought him mer and how fitting it is that Christ would receive such gifts as these because gold speaks of deity and God is deity frankincense it speaks of service and myrr it speaks of death and that's what he was you see it was God deity and service to die for all of humanity that's what he was the very thing that they brought identified what they thought he was and today the things that we bring to him identifies what our thoughts is about him it identifies what our thoughts is about him you understand what I mean tonight that if you believe it with all of your heart every word that you identified by giving all that you have but if you believe it's a good place to associate with better people around church and things like that and just about what you give and just a few social hours of uh of with some of the congregation or something but if you really believe it with all your heart then you give everything that's in you to it and it identifies that you truly believe the message that you believe it to be the truth so I ask you tonight in this present world where gifts should be offered to a King what gifts do you give what do you freely give to this King how do you identify this King is he King is he Lord or is he a on the street to you he's not asking for much tonight all he's asking for is your heart because the Bible records to us that every man according as Heath purp it in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for God loves a cheerful Giver the Bible also declares to us in John 3:16 for God so loved the world world that he gave he didn't give grudgingly he didn't give out of necessity but he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved we thank the Lord for a savior that came 2,000 years ago tonight we wanted to present to you this this plate that God's gifts always find their places it was inspired because about 15 years ago our pastor brother Ron Spencer that sits here he preached a sermon on Christmas morning from this very text John 3:16 and took the in the street and he preached it in such a way and had such an impact on us and with brother Ron's gift he had us all sitting on the edge of our seat waiting for the next word he had us as the train he had us laying there and when he rolled over we seen Christ laying there but four years ago four years ago yesterday the Lord spoke to our pastor and said if you'll trust me I'll use you like never before Full Gospel Lighthouse we've received a gift these past four years we've seen Christ come in a god-called man and tell us that the h won't stop the music amen he's told us that Satan has underestimated us that you can overcome in your night Seasons nonon it's time to go watch the strength of God is great enough for your needs and we stand as a declaration and that we are experiencing fulfillment brother Timothy he told you that you're in God's hands and one of my favorites these are all sermon titles that have brought to you in the last four years but this is one of my favorites that he has not sent me to this battle to lose and his latest of series every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that this is the greatest gift that ever has been and ever will be given amongst Humanity the promised gift the son of almighty God we've received a great gift here in these past four years the gave everything within him to get the doll to his little child but in his own Humanity he couldn't get it to her but in this life the greatest gift that ever was given he made a way that you wouldn't have to be without this gift but that Gift Giver would come and live on the inside of your heart and he would reign supreme if you would allow him to do so so in this Christmas season I believe that God God's gifts have found their place and young and old and the message is here and it's living out we see gold we see frankincense and we see M living right here in the body of Christ it's death to self for service for almighty God to live you see those wise men cross thousands of miles I'm sure they went through well I'm sure they went through all kinds of things that maybe we never heard of but no matter what they went went through they kept following the star these past four years have been a treasure to us that no matter what we go through we keep following the star when the journey got hot for the wise men they kept following the star this was not just some easy Journey for them they traveled for 2 years trying to find this child no matter what desert they were going through they followed that star no matter what critics said they were trusting in the gift that God had allowed them with the ability that had passed over every observatory in the land they were trusting in the star that they were following and God has given to us in this generation a seven star that has led us to Christ the child not a child that is in a Manger of 2,000 years ago but a god that is ever presentent that he promised you that he'd never leave you and he'd never forsake you I'd say that Full Gospel Lighthouse has been blessed to say that God's Gift has found its place in our heart who knew that these three wise men could let trust lead them to the greatest gift and if you'll trust him he'll use you like never before if I could have the key ofc or key of G sister Cassie I wonder in this Christmas season could you say I give myself away oh God I give myself away so you can use me I give myself [Music] away I give myself away so you can use me oh here I oh here I stand oh Lord my life is in your hands oh Lord I Longing to see your desires reveal in me I give myself [Laughter] away oh I give myself away so you can use me oh all the way I'm going all the way all the way I'm going all the way I'm going all the way with my Lord all the way oh all the way I'm going all the way all the way I'm going all the way I'm going all the way with the Lord amen God richly bless you this evening did you enjoy the promised gift amen amen amen amen these things as you know it takes a multitude of a team and what you see here what you've seen presented to you in the last 35 minutes has taken a few months to come together lines play practices and

big hand tonight God bless you amen amen thank God for what he has showed us and thank God that he's been with us through this whole time and we want to thank every visitor that is here and uh come

highest compliment I've ever had those titles over the last four years and amen each each sermon has a place and I remember that that sermon that I spoke 15 years ago the on the street I remember going home and weeping and weeping and because they got a hold of me I trust that that same God gets a hold of all of our lives and no matter how long we've been a Christian he's always there for us and we certainly love you with all of our hearts and there's been good times in our battles and there been tough times in our battles and I thank God for the team that God allowed me to have around me and and uh for those that don't know we fight brain cancer and lung cancer they gave me four months but I got a gift I'm still here with you and so we thank the Lord for that I'm still here amen don't

life is so dear life is so wonderful your family is so great don't forget to talk to God every morning every day cuz he deserves to hear from you and and you spend time with him and and I'll tell you what he'll do he'll come and spend time with you God bless you God bless you amen would you give him a hand ain't he awesome well maybe we're a little bit partial but I believe that we've got the
