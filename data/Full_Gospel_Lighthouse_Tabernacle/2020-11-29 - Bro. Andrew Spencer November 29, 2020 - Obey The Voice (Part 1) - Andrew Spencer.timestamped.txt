[44:30] lot better than what he was yesterday
[44:36] amen certainly thankful for what the
[44:40] lord has done for brother ron and
[44:42] and it looked like he had every sign of
[44:44] a heart attack but
[44:46] all of his levels were looking good and
[44:47] everything and so
[44:49] you know he left there with questions
[44:51] and not really answers of what was going
[44:53] on but i told him sometimes with cancer
[44:55] patients quirky things happen
[44:57] and you know whether it was a heart
[44:59] attack
[45:00] coming on the way i believe that if it
[45:02] was god stopped it
[45:04] and god's still in the business and and
[45:07] we're so appreciative i want to continue
[45:08] to
[45:09] remember brother ron this morning still
[45:11] dealing with some pain in his chest and
[45:12] things there so
[45:13] just be remembering him as i know you
[45:15] always are but
[45:17] and uh so we just certainly greet him
[45:19] he's listening this morning and
[45:21] and uh just had a real late night there
[45:24] but
[45:25] we thank the lord they released him
[45:26] about ten o'clock last night and
[45:28] and so we're just thankful and thankful
[45:30] to brother nathaniel sister suzanne
[45:32] to be able to go there with them and
[45:34] answer our questions and
[45:36] the spencer family is forever indebted
[45:39] to the holmes family we
[45:41] so appreciate them and they've been with
[45:43] us as everybody else in this journey but
[45:45] they've been ever so familiar with all
[45:48] of the things that the doctors are
[45:50] saying and
[45:51] sometimes to me that's like greekology
[45:53] right there but
[45:54] i'm so thankful to have brother
[45:55] nathaniel he's a real
[45:57] he's more than he's more than a brother

[53:14] amen mark chapter five and verse one
[53:19] this morning
[53:22] let me say amen when you have it
[53:25] amen thankful to see you all flipping
[53:28] through the pages of your bible
[53:31] it's the greatest it's the greatest
[53:32] sound in the earth
[53:36] and they came over onto the other side
[53:38] of the sea into the country of the
[53:40] gatherings and when he was come
[53:42] out of the ship immediately there met
[53:44] him
[53:45] out of the tombs a man with an unclean
[53:47] spirit
[53:49] who had his dwelling amongst the tombs
[53:51] and no man could bind him no
[53:53] not with chains because that he had been
[53:56] often bound with fetters and chains and
[53:58] the chains had been plucked asunder by
[54:00] him
[54:01] and the fetters broken in pieces neither
[54:03] could any man tame him
[54:05] and always night and day he was in the
[54:08] mountains and in the tombs crying and
[54:10] cutting himself with stones
[54:13] but when he saw jesus afar off he ran
[54:16] and worshiped him
[54:17] and cried with a loud voice and said
[54:19] what have i to do with thee jesus thou
[54:22] son of the most high god i adjure thee
[54:25] by god that thou
[54:27] torment me not for he said unto him
[54:30] come out of the man thou unclean spirit
[54:33] notice jesus wasn't jumping up and down
[54:36] jesus wasn't screaming jesus wasn't
[54:39] raising his voice
[54:40] but he simply said come out of the man
[54:43] thou
[54:43] unclean spirit and he asked him what is
[54:46] thy name and he answered saying my name
[54:48] is legion for we are many
[54:50] and he besought him much that he would
[54:54] not send them away out of the country
[54:55] now there were
[54:57] now there was there nigh under the
[54:59] mountains a great herd of swine feeding
[55:01] and all the devils besought him saying
[55:04] send us into the swine that we may enter
[55:06] into them
[55:07] and forthwith jesus gave them leave
[55:10] and the unclean spirits went out and
[55:12] entered into the swine
[55:14] and they and the herd ran violently down
[55:17] a steep place
[55:18] into the sea they were about 2
[55:22] 000 and were choked in the sea
[55:25] god bless you you may be seated this
[55:26] morning
[55:28] we realized this morning that that we're
[55:30] holding in our hand the greatest
[55:32] the greatest thing that we could hold in
[55:34] our hands this morning and that is the
[55:35] word of god
[55:37] and we realize and we're very very
[55:39] pertinent and very
[55:40] understanding in god's word that his
[55:42] word is his voice
[55:44] and that god is the creator of all
[55:46] things there's not one thing
[55:48] that is made that that he didn't make
[55:50] and because we understand that god is
[55:52] the creator of life and we understand
[55:55] that that god holds all things in his
[55:57] hands there's not
[55:58] anything that was made that was that
[56:00] that was made without him
[56:02] because the bible would tell us in the
[56:04] beginning was the word and the word was
[56:06] with god
[56:06] and the word was god you cannot separate
[56:10] god from his voice and and the bible
[56:12] says in colossians chapter 1 and 16 that
[56:15] for by him were all things created that
[56:18] are in heaven and that are in earth
[56:20] visible and invisible whether they be
[56:22] thrones or dominions or principalities
[56:25] or powers all things were created by him
[56:28] and for him and he is before all things
[56:32] and by him all things consist i could
[56:35] say that we would completely agree this
[56:36] morning that
[56:37] that god is the creator of all things
[56:41] is that right this morning and so we
[56:43] understand that god is the creator of
[56:45] all things and we get a glimpse of god
[56:47] in his creation work
[56:48] when we look back into the genesis when
[56:50] we look back in the beginning
[56:52] and we see that in the beginning that
[56:54] god created the heaven
[56:56] and the earth and the earth was without
[56:59] form and void
[57:00] and darkness was upon the face of the
[57:02] deep and the bible said that the spirit
[57:04] of god
[57:05] moved out across the waters
[57:08] and god said let there be light
[57:12] now you could see as a prophet would
[57:13] catch that he said i could see him as
[57:15] he's saying those things
[57:17] as he's moving out across that he said
[57:19] there's not even an atom or anything
[57:21] there
[57:22] he said but then all of a sudden he
[57:23] speaks and an atom breaks
[57:25] and adam breaks and it goes off and he
[57:28] creates a sun
[57:29] and he said it goes off for a millions
[57:31] of millions of years
[57:33] and then a little clinker falls off of
[57:36] that and it
[57:36] and he lets it fall for before millions
[57:39] and millions of years he said it's a sun
[57:42] that is coming off of that
[57:43] the piece of that sun it's a star coming
[57:46] off of that
[57:47] and he lets it fall and he lets it come
[57:49] to its spot in its position
[57:51] there was nothing that could stop it
[57:54] until it got to its place
[57:56] of position which god had ordained it to
[57:58] be him
[57:59] and god spoke those words and he said
[58:02] let there be
[58:03] and god believed his own word
[58:07] god believed what he said that the thing
[58:09] that he spoke was going to come to pass
[58:11] and how did he interpret that by
[58:13] bringing it to pass
[58:16] i'd say this morning that we all did not
[58:18] just gather here we didn't just come
[58:20] here just to see one another we didn't
[58:21] just come here
[58:22] out of formality's sake or out of
[58:24] tradition's sake i believe that every
[58:26] one of us that are
[58:27] that are sitting here truly within my
[58:28] heart i believe that everyone that is
[58:31] sitting here this morning
[58:32] has come to hear the voice of god i know
[58:35] that sometimes
[58:36] the preaching gets hard and it seems
[58:37] like it's cutting and it's
[58:39] and it's driving at you but that is not
[58:41] towards you
[58:42] that is driving at the spirit of the day
[58:44] but i really believe with all of my
[58:46] heart that every person that's sitting
[58:47] here
[58:48] has come here with an intention on
[58:50] hearing the voice of god
[58:52] now sometimes when god speaks he'll
[58:54] speak directly to you or
[58:56] maybe he'll speak through a preacher or
[58:58] maybe he'll speak through
[58:59] maybe one another but sometimes when god
[59:01] speaks he'll he'll drop a word
[59:03] right in your heart at a very very
[59:05] pertinent time in your life and
[59:07] and you'll realize maybe maybe it was a
[59:09] preacher that had
[59:10] had preached a sermon maybe a year ago
[59:12] and then all of a sudden god stirred it
[59:14] up in your mind and he brought it to
[59:16] your remembrance
[59:17] and all of a sudden god begins to speak
[59:20] to your life on certain questions that
[59:22] you've had
[59:23] and he begins to speak to you and he
[59:25] begins to line out all the questions
[59:27] that you have
[59:28] and you knew that it was god speaking to
[59:30] you sometimes
[59:32] he will speak to us sometimes he isn't
[59:33] it isn't always an audible voice
[59:36] but sometimes he speaks directly to you
[59:38] through maybe a brother or sister in
[59:40] christ or
[59:40] maybe he'll speak to you this morning by
[59:42] the preaching of the word i i believe
[59:44] that's what he does is by the preaching
[59:46] of the word
[59:47] and so we we see that when when god
[59:50] goes to speaking that his people always
[59:53] recognize that it's god speaking and we
[59:56] we look out in the service and i'd say
[59:58] that with all of my
[1:00:00] heart that jesus is here and whenever
[1:00:02] the pillar of fire is visible
[1:00:04] it's a vindication that god is wanting
[1:00:07] to speak
[1:00:08] then you know there's sometimes that
[1:00:09] you're just asking that that you need
[1:00:11] you maybe lay a fleece out before the
[1:00:13] lord and you want to know something or
[1:00:15] you're looking at this situation now god
[1:00:17] this is this is what i got to do i
[1:00:20] remember one time in my life i remember
[1:00:22] predominantly one time in my life
[1:00:24] there's been many times that god has
[1:00:25] spoken to me and
[1:00:26] i've heard his voice speak to my heart
[1:00:28] and heard him speak and it sounded like
[1:00:30] a
[1:00:31] big thunderclap went off and he just
[1:00:32] basically called my name
[1:00:34] and i knew that he was speaking to me
[1:00:35] and nobody else in the room was having a
[1:00:37] clue what was going on
[1:00:39] but i was being revealed to me something
[1:00:41] was being revealed to me
[1:00:42] that only i even knew was what was going
[1:00:45] on
[1:00:46] but i remember one time predominantly in
[1:00:48] my life when i was
[1:00:49] when i was seeking to hear the voice of
[1:00:51] god and that was when i was
[1:00:52] when i felt a call to go into the
[1:00:54] ministry
[1:00:55] and preach this gospel i had run i'd run
[1:00:58] with everything that was on the with
[1:01:00] inside of me and i'd done my very best
[1:01:02] but you can run but you can't hide from
[1:01:04] god and and i was i had come to a spot
[1:01:07] and i believe that if god's ordained you
[1:01:09] to a position
[1:01:10] that god will get you there no matter
[1:01:12] what
[1:01:13] and have you ever run from something
[1:01:15] that you were destined to do in your
[1:01:17] life and
[1:01:17] have you ever run from something that
[1:01:19] you are meant to do in life you are
[1:01:21] built to do in life
[1:01:22] what sure you have you were built to be
[1:01:24] a son and daughter of god
[1:01:26] but you spent half of your life running
[1:01:28] away from god
[1:01:30] running away from his promises but one
[1:01:32] day the spirit of the lord came by your
[1:01:34] way
[1:01:35] and he called your name and you knew
[1:01:36] that it was him speaking to you
[1:01:39] but i shut myself in and i had felt this
[1:01:42] call and it even got to a spot that my
[1:01:44] wife
[1:01:44] was sitting at the kitchen table and
[1:01:46] said when you're going to stop running
[1:01:48] i said well i don't know i'll just keep
[1:01:51] on running
[1:01:52] i tried my best to run from it but it
[1:01:54] got so
[1:01:55] and i'm only just bringing this to you
[1:01:56] so you understand
[1:01:58] that sometimes you get to a spot when
[1:02:00] you get desperate that you got to hear
[1:02:02] the voice of god
[1:02:03] and i shut myself in a closet and i shut
[1:02:06] myself in my upper room
[1:02:07] and i got up there and i said now god if
[1:02:09] this is what you want me to do
[1:02:12] i'm not going unless i hear your voice
[1:02:15] i'm not going out there because i feel
[1:02:17] something i'm not going out there
[1:02:18] because somebody else seen that i was
[1:02:20] carrying this gospel
[1:02:21] i'm going out there because i
[1:02:23] specifically heard from you
[1:02:25] i shut myself in that room for hours
[1:02:28] upon hours
[1:02:29] and then all of a sudden i heard a voice
[1:02:31] speak to me turn to isaiah 30 and 21
[1:02:34] that my ears will hear a voice behind me
[1:02:37] saying
[1:02:38] walk ye in this way when you turn to the
[1:02:40] left and when you turn to the right
[1:02:42] when i heard that voice i was running
[1:02:45] one way but when i heard that voice
[1:02:47] i started running with everything within
[1:02:49] me toward that voice
[1:02:51] that told me to walk in this way and
[1:02:53] he's never left me
[1:02:54] and he won't leave you when he calls
[1:02:56] your name he won't leave you in your
[1:02:58] calling
[1:02:59] maybe your call is just a housewife but
[1:03:01] he's not going to leave you in that call
[1:03:03] he's going to be right there with you
[1:03:05] maybe he's called you to be a
[1:03:06] businessman in this day
[1:03:08] he's not going to leave you he's going
[1:03:10] to speak to you he's got life on the
[1:03:12] inside of you
[1:03:13] you are his voice you are his life you
[1:03:16] are his feet
[1:03:17] you are his hands and if anybody's gonna
[1:03:21] be a voice of god today
[1:03:23] let it be the voice of full gospel
[1:03:26] lighthouse
[1:03:29] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:03:35] even nature has got to obey his voice
[1:03:38] that if there's something laying there
[1:03:42] that's on the inside and only if that
[1:03:45] seed
[1:03:46] has been dramatized it's got to come up
[1:03:50] even nature itself has to listen to the
[1:03:53] voice of god
[1:03:54] it recognizes its presence and many
[1:03:56] times when we go to thinking about the
[1:03:58] voice of god and we begin to think about
[1:04:00] the pillar of fire and nature obeying
[1:04:02] you all remember you were here at
[1:04:04] brother steve thomas's funeral and you
[1:04:06] remember that brother steve
[1:04:07] lived a a real godly life and brother
[1:04:10] steve came and we had his funeral here
[1:04:13] and
[1:04:13] and we had flowers all decorated around
[1:04:16] this altar here
[1:04:17] and the pillar of fire stood behind this
[1:04:20] pulpit
[1:04:20] and moved across this altar and when it
[1:04:23] did there was flowers that were setting
[1:04:25] here
[1:04:26] that had not yet bloomed yet but when
[1:04:28] that pillar of fire
[1:04:29] went across those flowers they begin to
[1:04:32] bloom
[1:04:33] in the presence of the sun you see
[1:04:36] anything that's got life in it when the
[1:04:38] sun goes passing by
[1:04:40] its way it's got to come forth you know
[1:04:42] you where you get your best grass out
[1:04:44] the best looking grass is right beside
[1:04:46] the concrete
[1:04:47] you see you can try to lay anything you
[1:04:49] want to on top of that seed
[1:04:51] you can cover it up with concrete you
[1:04:53] can cover it up with sin
[1:04:55] you can cover it up with unbelief you
[1:04:57] can cover it up with doubt but if there
[1:04:59] is a dermatitis seed laying there when
[1:05:01] the sun goes to calling for that seed
[1:05:04] it's got to come forth it's got to come
[1:05:07] forth and though you might be running
[1:05:09] though you might have
[1:05:10] questions though you might wonder why
[1:05:12] i'm the thunder am i here
[1:05:14] at the house of god this morning i
[1:05:16] happen to believe this morning
[1:05:18] maybe i'm just crazy enough to believe
[1:05:20] it if you're sitting there in that
[1:05:22] condition
[1:05:23] i would say that god has got something
[1:05:25] on the inside of you
[1:05:26] that is one to resurrect and if you are
[1:05:30] his
[1:05:30] child that voice will raise you up that
[1:05:33] voice caught a dead man
[1:05:34] that had been laying in the grave for
[1:05:36] four days over in another world
[1:05:38] but that body of lazarus had to obey the
[1:05:42] voice of god
[1:05:43] when he said lazarus come forth maybe
[1:05:46] he'll scream out anna come forth maybe
[1:05:48] he'll scream like josh come forth
[1:05:51] you can sit there in your dead cold
[1:05:54] formal religion
[1:05:55] or you can come to the voice this
[1:05:57] morning
[1:06:01] hallelujah he controls all things
[1:06:04] he's in control this morning can we say
[1:06:06] that this morning
[1:06:08] he's in control of this service he's in
[1:06:10] control of our lives he's in control of
[1:06:12] everything
[1:06:13] so who's controlling you who's
[1:06:15] controlling your life who's controlling
[1:06:17] is it satan
[1:06:19] if satan is controlling your life you
[1:06:22] know that there is a perversion there
[1:06:24] but god is wanting to so control your
[1:06:26] storms
[1:06:27] he's so wanting to control your life and
[1:06:29] speak life and peace to your storms
[1:06:32] i was reading this past week over in in
[1:06:34] mark chapter 4 and i was reading over
[1:06:36] here and it's a very familiar scripture
[1:06:38] to each and every one of us
[1:06:39] that when jesus had been doing and went
[1:06:41] about the father's work that he went out
[1:06:43] and he
[1:06:44] and he was preaching the gospel and the
[1:06:46] bible said that jesus laid in the back
[1:06:48] into the boat
[1:06:49] laid his head down on a pillow and went
[1:06:51] to sleep and and i've read that story
[1:06:53] and we watch and we see how that the
[1:06:55] storm
[1:06:56] obeyed what jesus said when they woke up
[1:06:59] jesus
[1:07:00] but i caught something this week when i
[1:07:02] was reading over those things
[1:07:04] that there was three fears in this
[1:07:06] picture there was first of fear
[1:07:08] upon the disciples that they were
[1:07:10] fearful that they would perish
[1:07:12] and that they would be destroyed but
[1:07:14] then they woke up jesus
[1:07:16] the second fear that i seen in the
[1:07:18] picture was also
[1:07:20] that when jesus put his foot up there
[1:07:23] and he stood up in his authority
[1:07:25] and he stood said to the storm and he
[1:07:28] said peace to that storm that the storm
[1:07:30] had to obey what jesus said i believe
[1:07:33] there's so much power in the voice of
[1:07:35] god
[1:07:36] that he can control your storms this
[1:07:38] morning but
[1:07:39] then the bible said that the disciples
[1:07:42] exceedingly
[1:07:43] were fearful this was a different fear
[1:07:47] from the fear that you had just seen
[1:07:50] just maybe a few scriptures beforehand
[1:07:53] but this was a godly fear that even the
[1:07:56] winds
[1:07:57] and the waves have to obey him but
[1:08:00] there's another third fear in the
[1:08:02] picture
[1:08:03] if you ain't seen it yet have hallelujah
[1:08:06] the storm was so fearful of jesus's
[1:08:10] voice
[1:08:10] that it had to run for cover
[1:08:13] i want to say to you this morning that
[1:08:16] the devil is scared
[1:08:17] about what's about to be said
[1:08:23] you see he's going to try to throw up a
[1:08:25] storm
[1:08:26] he's going to try to throw up a storm to
[1:08:28] keep you from your breakthrough
[1:08:32] he's going to try to throw up all kinds
[1:08:33] of chaos in your life to keep you from
[1:08:35] your victory
[1:08:36] he's going to throw up all kinds of all
[1:08:38] kinds of blocks in your life
[1:08:40] to keep you from getting the holy ghost
[1:08:42] i believe with all of my heart
[1:08:44] last night what happened to brother on
[1:08:46] was a storm
[1:08:47] that was trying to stop somebody from
[1:08:49] getting a breakthrough this morning
[1:08:51] i don't care about covet i don't care
[1:08:53] what you got going on in your mind today
[1:08:55] if you need a refilling of the baptism
[1:08:58] of the holy ghost
[1:08:59] i pray that you come to this altar and
[1:09:01] get so filled up
[1:09:02] that the devil gets scared of your voice
[1:09:06] if you are not making satan shaking his
[1:09:09] boots
[1:09:10] you don't have the right voice but you
[1:09:12] ain't got to leave here that way
[1:09:16] hallelujah you see there was a storm
[1:09:19] before
[1:09:20] legion got his breakthrough
[1:09:24] hallelujah maybe his name's not legion
[1:09:28] today maybe it's
[1:09:29] maybe it's your name maybe it's where
[1:09:31] you're sitting at maybe it's you
[1:09:32] listening by the way the internet
[1:09:34] but there might be a storm that's come
[1:09:35] up recently in your life that's trying
[1:09:37] to keep you from a breakthrough
[1:09:38] but i want to tell you jesus is coming
[1:09:42] jesus is coming the seas the seas even
[1:09:45] got mad
[1:09:46] because we know that the enemy has
[1:09:48] control over the power
[1:09:50] of the air and he got behind the wind
[1:09:52] and he perverted the wind
[1:09:53] he got behind the waves and he perverted
[1:09:55] the waves and he tried to kill jesus
[1:09:58] whoo hallelujah you can't kill the
[1:10:01] author of life
[1:10:02] and if the author of life is living on
[1:10:04] the inside of you
[1:10:05] he can't kill you you might go to a
[1:10:08] grave
[1:10:09] but you're going to raise up one of
[1:10:10] these mornings the voice of resurrection
[1:10:13] is in the body and if you are his
[1:10:17] hallelujah some of you may run before me
[1:10:19] but if you go by the way of the grave
[1:10:21] you'll be the first ones that raise up
[1:10:23] on resurrection morning
[1:10:25] [Applause]
[1:10:27] oh hallelujah and we're coming right
[1:10:29] behind you
[1:10:30] that in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:10:32] eye
[1:10:34] we shall be caught up to meet our maker
[1:10:38] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:41] the prophet would say that you
[1:10:44] are hanging over hail by a chain
[1:10:48] and that chain is as strong as its
[1:10:51] weakest link
[1:10:52] and he said you're hanging over top of
[1:10:54] hail
[1:10:55] by a chain of the word and he said when
[1:10:58] a believer
[1:10:59] takes when a believer becomes a
[1:11:01] make-believer
[1:11:02] and lives on one word that's contrary
[1:11:06] to the word he cuts his fellowship with
[1:11:08] god
[1:11:09] and he breaks that link you remember
[1:11:12] that your faith in this word
[1:11:14] is like a chain and when you break that
[1:11:17] fellowship with god
[1:11:20] you are hanging over top of hell i want
[1:11:23] you to know that hale was looking for
[1:11:25] some trophies this morning
[1:11:27] hell ain't interested in politicians
[1:11:29] because he's got most of them
[1:11:31] hale ain't interested in bootleggers
[1:11:33] because he's got most of them
[1:11:34] hale ain't interested in the democrats
[1:11:37] he ain't interested in republicans
[1:11:39] because he's got most of them
[1:11:40] hell ain't even interested with your
[1:11:42] localities down here
[1:11:44] hell is interested in stopping you from
[1:11:47] who you ordained to be
[1:11:49] hell's not interested in dope addicts
[1:11:51] hail's not interested in alcoholics
[1:11:53] because he's already got them but i want
[1:11:55] to tell you god's interested in them
[1:11:57] god's interested in politics god's
[1:12:00] interested in the government
[1:12:01] god's interested in dope addicts he's so
[1:12:04] interested
[1:12:05] that he wants to call to them
[1:12:10] oh hallelujah god is looking for sons
[1:12:14] that will put his word into action
[1:12:18] you see god needed a son
[1:12:21] when all of humanity was in a fallen
[1:12:23] condition
[1:12:24] god was looking for a son when adam
[1:12:27] heeded his wife's voice and
[1:12:29] instead of god's voice god was looking
[1:12:32] for a son
[1:12:34] man had constantly failed god jacob
[1:12:37] cheated
[1:12:38] david had an affair noah got drunk
[1:12:41] jonah ran from god gideon was insecure
[1:12:44] elijah got depressed moses stuttered
[1:12:48] man was constantly failing him he was
[1:12:51] constantly failing because he would get
[1:12:53] so high
[1:12:54] and he could not get above it but when
[1:12:57] it come to jesus
[1:12:58] jesus was not just an ordinary man he
[1:13:01] was a man that had the fullness of
[1:13:03] redemption
[1:13:04] that he was the true image of god that
[1:13:07] he was a reflection of god
[1:13:08] and he understood the plan of redemption
[1:13:12] and he would say i can do nothing unless
[1:13:15] my father in heaven chose me first
[1:13:19] he was such a man he was such a son
[1:13:23] that he would only do what the father
[1:13:26] told him to do
[1:13:28] you have the power to create a new world
[1:13:31] but you can only
[1:13:32] do what the father tells you to do
[1:13:37] you see he was looking for a son he was
[1:13:40] looking for a son that would go
[1:13:42] places that nobody else would go
[1:13:48] hallelujah he was looking for somebody
[1:13:51] that was willing to go where the
[1:13:52] pharisees wasn't willing to go
[1:13:55] when i brought brother denny and brought
[1:13:57] brother josh up here last evening you
[1:13:59] thought i was just doing that
[1:14:00] just to get somebody to come up here but
[1:14:03] it began to come
[1:14:04] to my mind when i had these two men
[1:14:07] standing before me
[1:14:08] that these two men would be just like
[1:14:11] the great mighty men of valor
[1:14:13] that was willing to go and get david the
[1:14:16] king of fresh drink of water
[1:14:18] and pour it out before him and say i'm
[1:14:21] willing to go all the way
[1:14:23] you see there was a lot of people that
[1:14:25] wasn't willing to go by brother denny's
[1:14:27] way
[1:14:28] there was a lot of people that wasn't
[1:14:30] willing to go by brother josh's way
[1:14:32] but jesus was interested in coming by
[1:14:35] their way
[1:14:36] and if you only if you
[1:14:39] only knew their story you would
[1:14:41] understand their amen
[1:14:43] you would understand their shout you
[1:14:45] would understand their amen you would
[1:14:47] understand why they get happy
[1:14:50] because jesus was willing to go where
[1:14:53] nobody else would go to
[1:14:56] god needed a son that could be rejected
[1:15:00] god needed a son that could be beat god
[1:15:03] needed a son that could be ridiculed
[1:15:07] when he's sitting in simon's house
[1:15:10] if you invite jesus he'll come
[1:15:14] he'll come to you this morning
[1:15:18] you may not know how to ask him to come
[1:15:20] but if you ask him just say lord
[1:15:22] i don't know exactly how to pray this i
[1:15:25] don't know exactly how to say this i
[1:15:27] don't know if i got to hold my hands
[1:15:28] this way or do that
[1:15:29] but if you can just bow your heart and
[1:15:32] you say god
[1:15:35] i want you to come by my way he'll come
[1:15:38] by your way
[1:15:40] it doesn't matter how bad your life is
[1:15:42] wrecked up he'll come by your way if you
[1:15:44] invite him
[1:15:45] but then you got to make him feel
[1:15:46] welcome but jesus was the type of son
[1:15:50] that he was willing to go where nobody
[1:15:52] else would go
[1:15:54] when he's sitting at simon's house
[1:15:56] everybody's making fun of him
[1:15:58] he ain't got no new robe he ain't got a
[1:16:00] kiss and he's sitting there with dirty
[1:16:03] feet
[1:16:04] but there was a woman that didn't have
[1:16:07] an invitation
[1:16:08] that was also rejected but she gave
[1:16:11] jesus the right kind of invitation
[1:16:14] hallelujah you see jesus
[1:16:17] knew before he ever made a trip to
[1:16:19] simon's house
[1:16:20] what was going to happen and he was
[1:16:23] sitting there
[1:16:24] and even simon and even some of jesus's
[1:16:27] old disciples said
[1:16:29] if he knew what type of woman that was
[1:16:33] doing that act to him
[1:16:35] you would not consider him a prophet but
[1:16:37] he was
[1:16:38] willing hallelujah to let this take
[1:16:42] place
[1:16:42] because the sacrifice had to be washed
[1:16:46] oh hallelujah and jesus turned to them
[1:16:54] he turned to them this woman that had
[1:16:57] no right in their eyes to be at jesus
[1:17:00] feet
[1:17:02] you didn't welcome me you didn't welcome
[1:17:05] me with a kiss
[1:17:07] you didn't pour the oil upon me you
[1:17:10] you just sent an invitation but you
[1:17:12] didn't even make me feel welcome
[1:17:16] you only brought me here to make a
[1:17:18] mockery of me
[1:17:20] oh i said it last night but it's worth
[1:17:22] repeating again today
[1:17:24] satan can try to mock he can try to
[1:17:27] disrupt god's plans
[1:17:29] when satan comes with plans it's only a
[1:17:32] set up for god's opportunities to go to
[1:17:35] work in your life
[1:17:36] and satan might try to mock you this
[1:17:38] morning he might try to reject you this
[1:17:41] morning but it's a setup
[1:17:45] it's a setup for god to work something
[1:17:48] in your life
[1:17:52] how many of the pharisees would have
[1:17:54] allowed this to happen
[1:17:59] but god needed a son
[1:18:10] some of you are in that spot some of you
[1:18:14] are in the same spot
[1:18:15] when everybody else is give up hope when
[1:18:18] everybody else
[1:18:19] is saying there's no hope for you that
[1:18:22] you've done all these things wrong
[1:18:23] you've lied you cheated you stole you've
[1:18:25] done all kinds of things you're in the
[1:18:27] same boat
[1:18:28] but i want you to know that you can come
[1:18:30] to jesus's feet this morning
[1:18:32] you can pour your old alpine out upon
[1:18:34] him you can water his feet with tears
[1:18:37] and you can dry them with your hair i
[1:18:39] want you to know there's a lot of people
[1:18:41] that would have gave up on you
[1:18:42] but jesus won't give up when i can't go
[1:18:45] no further
[1:18:45] jesus will go further when the preacher
[1:18:48] can't go when the pastor can't go
[1:18:50] when the prophet can't go jesus will go
[1:18:55] hallelujah it's all about him
[1:19:02] hallelujah now let me come down to your
[1:19:06] predestination
[1:19:07] you're his people you're a peculiar
[1:19:09] treasure
[1:19:10] heaven and earth is his nature is his
[1:19:13] but you are his treasure
[1:19:16] you are his purchase price you are a
[1:19:18] blood washed
[1:19:19] blood bought bride of jesus christ fully
[1:19:22] standing there
[1:19:23] in your redemption this morning wrapped
[1:19:25] in the robe of redemption
[1:19:27] and you've got all of heaven behind you
[1:19:29] you are his
[1:19:30] and god is not willing to share you with
[1:19:33] the devil
[1:19:35] i tell you god is stingy when it comes
[1:19:37] to his children
[1:19:38] he's not willing that satan would snatch
[1:19:40] you out of out of his hands
[1:19:42] just like in the beginning satan tried
[1:19:44] to snatch you
[1:19:45] out of god's retentive plan but mercy
[1:19:48] said no god said i'm big enough
[1:19:51] satan ain't got enough but i'm more than
[1:19:53] enough
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:56] hallelujah a lot of people look at the
[1:19:58] cross and they see a beautiful cross
[1:20:00] it's a rugged cross that's where he paid
[1:20:03] for
[1:20:04] my redemption and when i look at that
[1:20:06] cross
[1:20:07] i don't see a beautiful cross i see a
[1:20:09] blood stained cross
[1:20:11] that said i'm more than enough to go to
[1:20:14] the uttermost
[1:20:15] and snatch my people out of the devil's
[1:20:18] hands
[1:20:24] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:30] hallelujah
[1:20:32] he's not willing that your spirit would
[1:20:35] be contaminated
[1:20:37] that's why he's preaching to you these
[1:20:39] things because his voice will go into
[1:20:42] your spirit
[1:20:43] and it'll break up those things that are
[1:20:45] holding you bound
[1:20:46] that's why he's preaching these things
[1:20:48] is that he will go in there and he'd
[1:20:49] break up those things
[1:20:50] that are trying to contaminate your life
[1:20:53] there's another king a king of chaos
[1:20:55] that's trying to control your life and
[1:20:57] trying to put things in your spirit but
[1:20:58] god's not willing that your spirit would
[1:21:00] be contaminated
[1:21:01] just like when sarah went into the
[1:21:03] king's palace
[1:21:05] god was not willing that her womb would
[1:21:07] be contaminated with another seed
[1:21:09] that seed was gone that wound was going
[1:21:11] to bring forth life
[1:21:12] praying it would be a royal royal
[1:21:14] priesthood that would come out of that
[1:21:16] lineage
[1:21:17] and he was not willing that that that
[1:21:19] womb would be
[1:21:20] contaminated by another man's seed and
[1:21:23] god spoke to him in a dream
[1:21:25] and said restore the man his wife
[1:21:27] hallelujah
[1:21:29] hallelujah restore the man his wife
[1:21:32] satan i want you to hear me
[1:21:34] take your hands off of god's property
[1:21:36] and restore the man his wife
[1:21:43] god's not willing that your spirit would
[1:21:46] be contaminated
[1:21:47] with some cold formal creed but he wants
[1:21:50] your womb so
[1:21:52] filled up with the quickening power of
[1:21:54] jesus christ
[1:21:55] that only his seed could bring forth
[1:21:57] that predestinated life
[1:22:03] there's power in this voice to change
[1:22:06] your life
[1:22:07] there's power in this voice to take you
[1:22:09] from a ragged man a wretched man
[1:22:11] a miserable man where you're so sick and
[1:22:13] tired of living the way you're living
[1:22:14] there's power in this voice
[1:22:16] to resurrect you you may be on a path of
[1:22:18] drugs
[1:22:19] you may be on a path of sin you may be
[1:22:21] on a path of all kinds of unfilthy
[1:22:24] of filthy things and filthy living his
[1:22:26] voice is going to break it up this
[1:22:28] morning
[1:22:29] i didn't come here just to play church
[1:22:31] this morning i come here
[1:22:32] with a mission on my mind i'm coming
[1:22:35] after god's children
[1:22:37] and if he has to use my voice so be it

[1:24:08] jesus is just as willing to take you
[1:24:10] back today

[1:24:14] that altar
[1:24:15] and he's more willing because you're
[1:24:18] still his
[1:24:19] child just out of his will
[1:24:24] hallelujah and there through the
[1:24:25] struggles she turned her face towards
[1:24:28] god
[1:24:29] the tears running down our young cheeks
[1:24:31] 18 month old baby living and one dead
[1:24:33] within
[1:24:34] and pray in the prayer of faith and in
[1:24:36] less than five minutes time
[1:24:38] that woman was sitting up under that
[1:24:40] oxygen tent saying
[1:24:41] brother branham something's happened in
[1:24:43] my soul
[1:24:44] i'm right with god again and there when
[1:24:47] the doctors looked at it
[1:24:48] and look something's happened said i
[1:24:50] believe in the morning we'll just take
[1:24:52] the baby for an operation
[1:24:54] see what a difference is when the
[1:24:56] anointing of god comes down
[1:24:59] where she was once scared of thinking oh
[1:25:01] it's just this it's this it's this
[1:25:03] but when god spoke then everything let
[1:25:06] loose
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:09] you're still his child you're just out
[1:25:11] of his will
[1:25:14] you can run but you can't hide you're
[1:25:16] still his child
[1:25:19] you're still his child you listen to
[1:25:21] this by the way of the internet
[1:25:23] you're still his child you might be out
[1:25:25] of his will
[1:25:26] but he ain't never lost you he's had his
[1:25:28] eye on you the whole time
[1:25:31] satan can try all he wants to but he
[1:25:33] ain't gonna get you
[1:25:36] you're just out of his will
[1:25:39] the son was willing to go here
[1:25:44] how many people could raise their hand
[1:25:47] and say that somebody wrote you off in
[1:25:52] life keep your hand up there
[1:25:57] somebody wrote you off in life said you
[1:26:01] never gonna make it
[1:26:03] said you wasn't good enough said you
[1:26:06] never get the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:26:08] he was rolled off in life
[1:26:12] i know where you're standing at legion
[1:26:15] was that type of man
[1:26:18] he'd been rolled off by the whole
[1:26:19] community he'd been rolled off
[1:26:22] mother branham would tap into that
[1:26:24] channel and he would say
[1:26:26] that he was a good man had a good family
[1:26:29] had two or three little children
[1:26:31] he said but he got to hanging out with
[1:26:32] her own crowd started drinking
[1:26:35] started started playing cards on
[1:26:36] wednesday night and saturday and sunday
[1:26:38] night
[1:26:38] and he got to hanging with the wrong
[1:26:40] crowd and all of a sudden
[1:26:43] those demons started entering to him
[1:26:46] now you can pick the first devil
[1:26:50] whether you want to give over to
[1:26:51] cigarettes whether you want to get over
[1:26:52] to pornography or whether you want to
[1:26:54] give over
[1:26:54] to all types of sin you get to choose
[1:26:56] the first one
[1:26:58] but you don't get to choose the other
[1:26:59] seven that's coming behind it
[1:27:07] are you with me this morning demons are
[1:27:10] real
[1:27:11] and they're hunting down your life
[1:27:16] he was rolled off by the community
[1:27:20] he'd got in such a place
[1:27:24] that chains couldn't even hold him that
[1:27:27] he was a friend
[1:27:28] to the graveyard
[1:27:32] the only time i want to go to a
[1:27:34] graveyard is when i know the rapture's
[1:27:36] coming
[1:27:37] and my loved one's walking out of there
[1:27:40] i'm sick and tired of burying my friends
[1:27:43] but here legion was so cast off
[1:27:47] and put back in a corner where the
[1:27:49] community
[1:27:50] didn't want nothing to do with him
[1:27:55] and these demons gave him such power
[1:27:58] three to four times of his own human
[1:28:00] strength that he would break those
[1:28:02] chains
[1:28:04] and the prophet would say that he would
[1:28:06] he would start to come back to himself
[1:28:09] and he'd start making away and start
[1:28:11] thinking about his family saying
[1:28:12] i need to go back to my family i need to
[1:28:15] go back to my home
[1:28:16] i need to go back and all of a sudden
[1:28:18] those demons would come
[1:28:19] and they would tear him again and he'd
[1:28:21] cut himself with stones
[1:28:23] and every person that he would come in
[1:28:25] contact with in the community
[1:28:27] he would overcome them and he would he
[1:28:30] would hurt them and they would run for
[1:28:31] cover
[1:28:32] but not this time
[1:28:35] this was not just an ordinary man that
[1:28:37] was walking by
[1:28:38] by legion's way this was more than an
[1:28:41] ordinary
[1:28:42] man this was the son of god that was a
[1:28:45] reflection of heaven
[1:28:46] that would say that the man by the name
[1:28:48] of legion
[1:28:49] is worthy cause for the gospel of jesus
[1:28:52] christ
[1:28:54] i'd say that when those demons got to
[1:28:56] looking that they began to pull back
[1:28:59] and make jesus make jesus feel like he
[1:29:02] wasn't welcome there and it even pulled
[1:29:04] legion back
[1:29:06] they tried to pull him back in those
[1:29:08] tombs they tried to back
[1:29:09] pull him back into that fear
[1:29:12] now let me come to you those
[1:29:15] demons have tried to keep you from
[1:29:18] entering into this service
[1:29:19] and entering to what you are truly meant
[1:29:22] to do
[1:29:23] those demons are going to try to pull
[1:29:25] you back from where you're meant to be
[1:29:27] and where you're built to be at
[1:29:29] my brother branham said that legion
[1:29:32] would have never went out there
[1:29:33] those demons would have never went out
[1:29:35] there allowed legion to go out there
[1:29:37] unless jesus unless legion pushed
[1:29:40] past those demons how would you know
[1:29:43] jesus is on his way but you've got to
[1:29:45] push past your demons
[1:29:46] you've got to push past your chains
[1:29:49] there's a voice
[1:29:50] that is coming that's going to break
[1:29:52] those chains but you got to push past
[1:29:55] yourself
[1:29:55] you got to be willing to go to him
[1:29:59] now these demons that had so controlled
[1:30:02] legion
[1:30:02] they'd so controlled him in such a way
[1:30:05] that
[1:30:06] every person he'd come in contact with
[1:30:08] that he would overcome them
[1:30:10] and he'd whip them
[1:30:13] but when he looked at jesus he's seen
[1:30:15] something he'd never seen before
[1:30:18] oh i don't know what i'm going to do
[1:30:20] with him you see there was something on
[1:30:22] the inside of jesus
[1:30:24] that he would scream out how did that
[1:30:27] power
[1:30:27] get on the inside of that man
[1:30:31] oh church of the living god i'd say
[1:30:33] you've got every demon in hell running
[1:30:35] for cover this morning
[1:30:36] saying how did that power get inside of
[1:30:40] that body
[1:30:43] how did that anointing how did that
[1:30:45] pentecostal experience
[1:30:46] get on the inside of that human vessel
[1:30:52] he's more than enough
[1:30:56] he's more than enough
[1:30:59] he is more than enough
[1:31:03] for me
[1:31:03] [Music]
[1:31:09] how did you get in there
[1:31:12] i see a little boy he used to be a
[1:31:15] little boy he's a whole lot taller than
[1:31:16] me
[1:31:17] he come when he first come to church
[1:31:18] here he started interpreting
[1:31:20] but now god did a work in his life and
[1:31:22] you ought to hear him interpret
[1:31:25] he ain't no longer just interpreting
[1:31:27] he's interpreting with emphasis
[1:31:29] because it means something on the inside
[1:31:30] of him how did that power
[1:31:33] get on the inside of that man
[1:31:38] hallelujah how did that holy ghost get
[1:31:41] on the inside of brother ray
[1:31:43] how did that same holy ghost get on the
[1:31:45] inside of sister stephanie
[1:31:47] that she once walked one way but now
[1:31:49] she's walking a different way
[1:31:52] and if you're not walking why don't you
[1:31:55] start while i'm talking
[1:31:56] walking up the kings highway
[1:32:03] how did you get on the inside of brother
[1:32:05] doug hill
[1:32:06] when death come knocking at his door
[1:32:09] there was a voice that said come back
[1:32:11] brother doug
[1:32:12] come back to me brother doug
[1:32:13] [Applause]
[1:32:20] life wasn't giving up when death came
[1:32:22] knocking at his door
[1:32:26] there is power oh in the voice of jesus
[1:32:32] or there is power in the voice of jesus
[1:32:36] there is power in the bride of jesus
[1:32:41] to break everything to break every chain
[1:32:47] who's controlling who you remind your
[1:32:51] demons
[1:32:52] i put you under a blood you got to stay
[1:32:55] there
[1:32:59] he was willing to go to you
[1:33:08] how many knows what it's like
[1:33:12] to see jesus on his way
[1:33:20] maybe you weren't strung out on alcohol
[1:33:22] maybe you wasn't strung out on drugs
[1:33:24] maybe he wasn't strung out on pot
[1:33:28] if you're doing those things those are
[1:33:30] the attributes of
[1:33:34] sin
[1:33:36] but just because you didn't smoke or you
[1:33:39] didn't drink you are on your way
[1:33:43] well i never gambled i never did
[1:33:45] anything wrong you were born in sin
[1:33:50] i know a lot of a lot of christians have
[1:33:53] said even in this church today
[1:33:55] that never did anything that we would
[1:33:58] say morally wrong
[1:34:00] but they recognize that they were a
[1:34:03] sinner
[1:34:06] oh hallelujah i could tell you stories
[1:34:07] on top of stories about how people come
[1:34:10] out of drugs
[1:34:10] and how people come out of cardboard
[1:34:12] boxes that they were living on a street
[1:34:14] how they come out of this certain type
[1:34:16] of situation but i can also tell you
[1:34:18] about somebody
[1:34:19] that was living a morally correct life
[1:34:21] that was living
[1:34:22] and they were listening to this message
[1:34:24] but they still recognize when jesus was
[1:34:27] on his way
[1:34:29] and when he spoke
[1:34:33] other people had spoken but when he
[1:34:37] spoke sister julia

[1:36:11] tactics you do not have to accommodate
[1:36:13] laodicea

[1:36:18] and say there's no vacancy

[1:36:25] different course
[1:36:26] no vacancy you do not have to put up
[1:36:29] with satan

[1:36:34] and control your emotions and to control
[1:36:37] you with depression
[1:36:38] and anxiety and fear and lies and all
[1:36:40] types of things

[1:36:55] and verse one and it shall come to pass
[1:36:56] now notice this is what i want you to
[1:36:58] notice
[1:36:59] notice the blessings that come from
[1:37:01] obeying the voice
[1:37:04] and it shall come to pass that if thou
[1:37:06] shall hearken diligently
[1:37:08] unto the voice of the lord thy god to
[1:37:10] observe and to do all his commandments
[1:37:12] which i command thee this day that that
[1:37:15] the lord thy

[1:38:07] enemies that rise up against thee
[1:38:08] to be smitten before thy face they shall
[1:38:11] come out against thee on one way
[1:38:13] and flee before these seven ways all
[1:38:15] this is due to obeying his voice
[1:38:18] the lord shall command the blessing upon
[1:38:21] thee in thy storehouses
[1:38:22] and in thou thou in all that thou set us

[1:38:39] and walk in his ways if you obey his
[1:38:43] voice
[1:38:44] all of these blessings will be yours
[1:38:48] but if you read from verse 15 on down
[1:38:50] the
[1:38:51] cursings that come from not obeying this
[1:38:53] voice
[1:38:54] are doubled by not obeying this voice
[1:38:58] i choose to stay on the top 15.
[1:39:02] i obey his voice that i'll be blessed
[1:39:04] when i come here
[1:39:05] and bless when i go out let him make me
[1:39:07] the head and not the tail
[1:39:10] he will put me above and not beneath
[1:39:13] obey his voice
[1:39:14] that's what you get
[1:39:20] there is power in you you ain't got no
[1:39:23] reason to fear
[1:39:24] you don't just hold a title in your hand
[1:39:26] you hold an abstract title
[1:39:28] that's been searched all the way back
[1:39:30] throughout sins life
[1:39:32] throughout all of it and it's been given
[1:39:34] to you that when a man
[1:39:36] once believes the word and the holy
[1:39:38] spirit comes behind it you
[1:39:40] have an abstract title deed that
[1:39:42] anything that was against your family
[1:39:45] has been struck off you ain't got
[1:39:47] nothing to be ashamed about
[1:39:49] you're a son of god a daughter of god
[1:39:56] fear has to listen to you not you
[1:39:59] listening to fear
[1:40:02] which fear are you accommodating
[1:40:06] a fear that you perish if so
[1:40:09] wake up jesus fear a covet wake up jesus
[1:40:13] fear of death wake up jesus or
[1:40:16] is it a godly fear that so puts the
[1:40:19] voice of god on the inside of you
[1:40:20] that the storms in your life have to
[1:40:23] listen to an ambassador of heaven
[1:40:29] this body must obey
[1:40:32] the voice
[1:40:36] now notice i'm getting ready to close
[1:40:41] you know sadia he said when you come to
[1:40:44] total obedience
[1:40:46] then you can have possession but until
[1:40:50] you totally obey you've got to
[1:40:52] completely surrender your own thoughts
[1:40:54] your own will your own mind and let the
[1:40:57] mind of christ operate in you
[1:40:59] now do you think that christ
[1:41:03] that do you think christ would with the
[1:41:05] mind of christ and you would say
[1:41:07] the days of miracles passed do you think
[1:41:10] the mind of christ in you
[1:41:12] would say the bible's right in some
[1:41:14] places
[1:41:15] and not in others the mind of christ
[1:41:18] would sanction
[1:41:19] every word that christ ever said it's
[1:41:21] right
[1:41:22] so if you don't use your own mind just
[1:41:24] use his
[1:41:26] his mind says and the church becomes a
[1:41:28] word when they let the word go through
[1:41:30] them
[1:41:31] his mind says you're sinless his mind
[1:41:34] says
[1:41:34] that the days of miracles are not past
[1:41:37] his mind says that you can have a
[1:41:39] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:41:41] his mind says you can have a sound mind
[1:41:45] and not the spirit of fear his mind says
[1:41:48] there's therefore now no condemnation
[1:41:50] to them that are in christ jesus who
[1:41:52] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:41:54] spirit
[1:41:55] his mind says they that are led by the
[1:41:57] spirit are the children of god
[1:41:59] his mind says greater is he that is in
[1:42:01] you than he that is in the world
[1:42:04] his mind said if god be for me
[1:42:09] who can be against me

[1:43:19] that this body has got to obey
[1:43:22] its confession his mind tells me
[1:43:26] that he's the high priest of our
[1:43:27] confession that he can be touched by the
[1:43:30] feeling of our infirmities
