[3:31] bit comical but we have an alarm system
[3:34] on our on our on our house and we've
[3:39] actually got 16 cameras on our house and
[3:41] so so we got this one alarm it just kept
[3:44] going off last night and I'd look at it
[3:46] and it looked like an image of a of a
[3:48] man walking and I'd looked at it well at
[3:51] two o'clock in the morning your mind
[3:52] goes every which way in the world and
[3:54] and I and I looked at it I thought I had
[3:57] something tonight I looked at and I kept
[3:59] playing it over and over and over again
[4:00] I look at and look at this looked like a
[4:02] man walking and and this today I figured
[4:05] out it was a spider web but one of these
[4:15] days that cameras going to pick up some
[4:17] people walking

[4:46] you this weekend and to speak to you on
[4:48] the bride's authority so I'll get
[4:52] started tonight and find a stop in place
[4:54] and we'll pick it up tomorrow evening I
[4:57] want to read a quote to you as I begin
[4:59] to go and fundamental foundation for
[5:02] faith brother Branham is speaking he
[5:06] says now Jesus said whatever you ask the
[5:10] Father in my name that will I do he said
[5:16] did you ever realize what that means
[5:19] do you realize if we go before God in
[5:23] the name of Jesus I want you to catch
[5:27] this it's just the same as Jesus himself
[5:31] praying it isn't me praying anymore if I
[5:40] come in his name and he recognizes his
[5:43] name and Jesus said whatever you ask and
[5:46] the father in my name that I do and then
[5:50] I go to the father in Jesus name it
[5:53] isn't me praying anymore
[5:56] it's Jesus it's his spirit praying
[6:01] through me and then I've got to receive
[6:05] what I asked for
[6:07] because he said it and it's God's own
[6:10] word it can't do nothing else but
[6:15] produce just what it said
[6:20] that's enough to close and say a man and
[6:23] say hadn't have been good to be in the
[6:24] house of the Lord
[6:26] revelations chapter 12 and verse 10 and
[6:31] I heard a loud voice saying in heaven
[6:33] now is come salvation and strength and
[6:37] the Kingdom of our God and and the power
[6:40] of his Christ for the accuser of our
[6:44] brethren is cast down which accused them
[6:49] before our God day and not now won't you
[6:55] put yourself in the scripture and they
[6:57] overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
[7:00] and by the word of their testimony and
[7:03] they loved not their lives unto death
[7:06] Psalms 23 it's very familiar to you and
[7:11] I want you to read it with me and we'll
[7:13] read it aloud if you can revelation or
[7:16] Psalms 23 and verse 1 if you don't have
[7:18] in your Bibles just look up there he
[7:20] said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[7:23] want he maketh me to lie down in green
[7:27] pastures he leadeth me beside the still
[7:31] waters he restoreth my soul
[7:34] and he leadeth me in the paths of
[7:36] righteousness for his name's sake and
[7:39] yea though I walk through the valley of
[7:41] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[7:43] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[7:47] staff they comfort me
[7:49] thou prepares the table before me in the
[7:52] presence of mine enemies thou anointest
[7:55] my head with all my cup runneth over
[7:58] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[8:02] me all the days of my life and I will
[8:05] dwell in the house of the Lord forever I
[8:09] want to say do you believe that
[8:12] [Music]
[8:17] you may be seated tonight and may the
[8:20] Lord bless the reading of each word in
[8:23] John chapter 10 and verse 19 then the
[8:28] same day at evening being the first day
[8:31] of the week when the doors were shut and
[8:33] the disciples were assembled for fear of
[8:36] the Jews came Jesus and stood in the
[8:41] midst and said to them peace be unto you
[8:46] and when he had so said he showed them
[8:49] his hands and his side you talking about
[8:54] a meeting that was a meeting there were
[9:03] disciples glad when they saw the Lord I
[9:08] cannot imagine what they felt like
[9:11] because now they had been on the run for
[9:14] a bit and then said Jesus to them again
[9:17] peace be unto you as my father had sent
[9:22] me even sinned are you and when he had
[9:27] said this he breathed on them and said
[9:33] unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost
[9:38] whosoever sins here Ament they are
[9:42] remitted unto them and whosoever sins
[9:46] you retain they are retained Matthew 16
[9:51] and verse 13 when Jesus came to the
[9:55] coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his
[9:57] disciples saying whom do men say that I
[10:00] the Son of Man am and they said some say
[10:04] that thou art John the Baptist and some
[10:06] Elias and others Jeremias or one of the
[10:09] prophets and he said unto them but whom
[10:11] say ye that I am power is not in what
[10:15] others say but what is your revelation
[10:20] or you announ want you to catch that
[10:21] power is not what others say but who do
[10:25] you say that I am and he said unto them
[10:29] who say you that I am and Simon Peter
[10:32] answered it said thou art the Christ the
[10:36] Son of the Living God and jesus answered
[10:39] and said unto him blessed art thou simon
[10:42] barjona for flesh and blood hath not
[10:44] revealed it unto thee but my father
[10:47] which is in heaven and I also say unto
[10:51] thee that thou art Peter and upon this
[10:53] rock I will build my church and the
[10:58] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[11:00] it
[11:01] upon the revelation of who Jesus Christ
[11:04] is he's not a second person he's not a
[11:08] third person Jesus is God and I will
[11:13] give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
[11:16] of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind
[11:19] on earth shall be bound in heaven and
[11:22] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[11:24] shall be loosed in heaven
[11:27] brother Tim sent me this a couple of
[11:30] weeks ago and spoke to my heart while I
[11:32] was gone and and he just quotes and he
[11:35] just shares this quote with me in 2nd
[11:37] Timothy 3 and 16 Paul states that all
[11:40] Scripture is god-breathed all Scripture
[11:45] is god-breathed and is useful for
[11:48] teaching rebuking correcting training
[11:52] and righteousness this is the only use
[11:55] in the Bible of the Greek the feel of us
[11:58] which means God breathed be inspired by
[12:02] God
[12:03] due to the inspiration of God but other
[12:06] scriptural passages support the basic
[12:09] principle the scripture being inspired
[12:12] by God the Word of God is formed by
[12:14] God's own breath quite a statement in it
[12:18] then it's more than just a book
[12:23] then it's more than just the book he
[12:27] says and when a man speaks it is the
[12:30] kiss life's breath that forms its word
[12:34] and when God speaks through a man it is
[12:39] the life of God the Holy Ghost
[12:41] forming his words as a man speaks as
[12:44] God's Oracle if anyone speaks let him
[12:48] speak as Oracles of God if any one
[12:51] ministers let him do it as a the ability
[12:54] of which God supplies that in all things
[12:56] God may be glorified through Jesus
[12:59] Christ to whom belong the glory and the
[13:03] Dominion for ever and ever
[13:05] I want to read to you because I think we
[13:11] sometimes hear a quote and it just kind
[13:15] of goes over real quickly and it kind of
[13:18] we kind of miss the emphasis of it Jesus
[13:22] said whatsoever you ask the Father in my
[13:28] name that will I do did you ever realize
[13:35] what that means do you realize that that
[13:38] if we go before God in the name of Jesus
[13:42] it's the same as Jesus himself praying
[13:49] that's quite a statement it that makes
[13:53] us all we reevaluate our time in prayer
[13:57] are you with me let's all remember and
[14:00] just in that very just in their very
[14:02] thought context before we go too far in
[14:05] the weekend our time in prayer
[14:07] they're not just idle words
[14:10] what I want you to remember who you are
[14:14] brother John you're a son of God I don't
[14:18] care what the devil whispers in your ear
[14:19] and tells you all different kind of
[14:21] things that that affects flesh and a
[14:23] better spirit how many of you get back
[14:27] sometimes in your flesh in your spirit
[14:30] and he attacks you and he does a lot of
[14:33] different kind of things and uses memory
[14:34] and conscience and reasoning but that
[14:37] will be inside of your soul that's the
[14:39] spot that he can affect and that's his
[14:42] eternal as Jesus is eternal and that
[14:49] seed was predestinated to life before
[14:52] there was ever a moon or a molecule or a
[14:55] Sun before God ever began to speak let
[14:59] there be you was there with God you
[15:05] stepped out of eternity into time may be
[15:08] born in 1961 come to maturity at some
[15:11] point in life well Homer said I probably
[15:14] never get there but as the son of God
[15:18] you begin to recognize where you came
[15:20] from and you realize I'm not leaning on
[15:23] the arm of my flesh I can't hold myself
[15:26] I'm not even going to try to hold on in
[15:29] my spirit to where that I feel it or I
[15:32] can imagine it or all right it's a
[15:35] thought but it's the Word of God it is
[15:38] the anchor to my soul not me holding on
[15:43] it's God holding on to me hallelujah
[15:53] let me just make a statement here got a
[15:56] will not lose one
[15:59] [Music]
[16:01] God's determined you might lose one you
[16:05] might be surprised what you live through
[16:07] and he will not lose one so when you
[16:16] realize who you are you can stand
[16:19] flat-footed throw your shoulders back as
[16:22] a prophet of God would stand there and
[16:24] he would throw his shoulders back and
[16:26] said I take every spirit in this
[16:28] building under my voice under control in
[16:31] the name of Jesus Christ are you with me
[16:37] now remember this the Prophet taught us
[16:40] if Jesus himself was here if Jesus
[16:47] himself was here he could not heal you
[16:51] he's already healed you
[16:54] [Applause]
[17:03] are you with me he's already healed too
[17:06] so you take him at his word and you
[17:10] believe his word do you get sick you'll
[17:13] get sick again you get healed you get
[17:15] sick again last list Jesus raised him up
[17:20] but because of Adam's fall lasher's had
[17:23] to go back to the ground again
[17:25] don't get mad cuz she gets sick again
[17:27] get mad at the devil cuz he's inflicted
[17:30] you again and take it right back to God
[17:33] [Applause]
[17:44] notice these words it's just the same as
[17:47] Jesus praying this is a prophet and he
[17:54] said it isn't me praying anymore if I
[17:57] come in in on his name and he recognizes
[18:01] his name and Jesus said whatsoever you
[18:04] ask in the Father in my name that I do
[18:09] and then I go to the father in Jesus
[18:14] name it isn't me praying anymore it's
[18:16] Jesus
[18:17] it's his Spirit praying through me and
[18:20] then I've got to receive what I asked
[18:22] for because he said it and it's God's
[18:26] own word and he treat do nothing else
[18:28] but produce what he just said so we must
[18:34] become inspired to speak now sometimes a
[18:39] gym you got a ball game today it was
[18:44] cold outside aren't you glad you don't
[18:47] need blankets into bargains and
[18:50] to sit here and listen to me preach now
[18:55] or he wears me but but they get in the
[18:57] spirit of it and they're getting the
[19:00] spirit II you won't enjoy the game
[19:02] unless you get in the spirit of it and
[19:06] that's the way it is when you come to
[19:08] church you gotta you gotta get in the
[19:10] spirit
[19:12] [Music]
[19:14] you gotta get in the spirit on the
[19:20] spirit of shopping at Walmart but you
[19:22] get in the spirit of worshiping the Lord
[19:24] you get beyond yourself and you get
[19:28] beyond your own feelings and get media
[19:30] to get in the spirit of it sometimes
[19:36] your prayers feel like they just go to
[19:37] the ceiling get in the spirit of prayer
[19:41] break through the channel I love that
[19:43] song that was just singing by our young
[19:45] people I want to thank you for taking
[19:47] part in all of that I want to thank
[19:48] brother Andrew and sister Katie and all
[19:50] of them that are involved that's doing
[19:52] that and I thank you for that
[20:00] we got a lot more following and you guys
[20:03] are setting the precedent for them
[20:04] that's following a menu set in a tall
[20:07] order but you summer song about
[20:09] breakthrough but sometimes you just
[20:12] gotta break through yourself the brand
[20:22] said just reminds the meat will come and
[20:24] spring timing I watch the birds building
[20:26] their nest and I think of old mother
[20:29] bird chicken chicken build her nesting
[20:31] get up on it lay her eggs but if that
[20:34] old mother bird hasn't got been with a
[20:37] male bird they'll never hatch them ads
[20:42] no matter how good she treats them how
[20:45] loyal she is it covers them with her
[20:47] wings and turns them over does
[20:49] everything she tended and sat there till
[20:52] she starves them eggs will never hatch
[20:54] if she hasn't been with the male bird
[20:57] they're because they're not fertile
[20:58] that's the way it is with organized
[21:01] religion as long as we take them sinners
[21:05] and they're just sinners into our church
[21:07] and you can baby them and make deacons
[21:10] out of them and marry them four and five
[21:12] times smoke drink gamble cheat lie put
[21:15] them on the Deacons in the church you
[21:17] can hover over them do anything you want
[21:19] to until they come into contact with the
[21:23] mate with Christ Jesus they're only a
[21:27] bunch of rotten eggs that's the reason
[21:34] you must never get your eyes on other
[21:36] human beings because humanity will fail
[21:41] you and if you haven't got a dose of the
[21:45] Holy Ghost in your life and he's not the
[21:48] king of your soul you will disappoint
[21:50] yourself
[21:55] but I've never been disappointed in
[21:57] Jesus here's the quarter wanted to give
[22:04] to you not making you fat so you hang
[22:07] did you pay attention to this one kind
[22:10] of puts me in the mind of a farmer one
[22:14] time you who went and wasn't what's that
[22:16] very much of a farmer he said he he got
[22:19] out a great big nice barns and tractors
[22:22] but the fellow was just too lazy to work
[22:26] lazy people just don't do well around
[22:28] maybe why he wouldn't make no hay puts
[22:32] me in in cuffs mine to some of these big
[22:34] churches and theologians that won't dig
[22:37] down and really take the Word of God
[22:39] they got big churches a lot of music and
[22:42] a lot of refinery but that don't mean
[22:44] that's all he just wouldn't worked and
[22:48] over he was his neighbor had a little
[22:50] old barn over there and he didn't have
[22:51] very much of the stall to keep his
[22:54] cattle in but he sure was an industrious
[22:57] man he really worked
[22:59] he raised great big crops of alfalfa put
[23:03] it in the barn the man had a mission you
[23:05] know and you know it in the wintertime
[23:07] come he said there's a little calf barn
[23:10] each each one of these cats in the barn
[23:12] and the next spring when the spring
[23:14] winds begin to blow they turned those
[23:17] little cats out while this one little
[23:19] calf turned out of this great big
[23:22] Cathedral you know while he was so poor
[23:25] he couldn't hardly stand nothing when
[23:28] almost blowing down why he'd walk out
[23:31] there's a little fella didn't have
[23:32] nothing at all to eat through the winter
[23:34] and he's fed on wigs and he didn't have
[23:37] much strength to stand on
[23:38] no wonder they can't believe in divine
[23:40] healing need of some vitamins well the
[23:45] first thing you know they let that other
[23:47] little calf out over the other barn he
[23:50] was all fat round he had a good alfalfa
[23:55] plenty of vitamins and he was fatten
[23:58] around that wind begin to just hit him
[24:01] and and that mighty
[24:03] rushing wind you know coming down and my
[24:06] he just picked up and jumped boxes and
[24:09] to run all around in the corral just as
[24:12] hard as he could
[24:13] that's what's going on here at this
[24:14] church you've been eating goods that
[24:18] causes you to be that little skinny calf
[24:33] that great out of that great big barn
[24:35] fine barn stuck his head through the
[24:37] crack of the fence it sits fanaticism
[24:45] why under fair that's what's the wrong
[24:53] today with the church it's under
[24:56] nourished Christ that for sinners that
[25:00] you could be free he died to heal the
[25:03] sick it's not fanaticism let the holy
[25:08] spirit strike you one time and and
[25:11] you'll feel like a running and cutting
[25:13] up - yes sir just get some good rich
[25:16] vitamins first from the world of God

[25:23] Word of God now want to caution coming

[33:09] giving it to my hand go and I'll go with
[33:13] you whatever you bind on earth I'll bind
[33:21] in heaven whatever you loose on earth a
[33:26] loose in heaven if you think it's the
[33:32] moment God has every one of us in
[33:34] different positions of life but it's
[33:38] glad with you sitting at that desk it's
[33:42] God with you doing your job
[33:48] bring the thing you shared something
[33:51] with me he said the scripture said lay
[33:52] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[33:54] he said I look at that as every patient
[33:57] that I wait on amen
[34:03] I look at that as every patient that I
[34:05] wait on they're hanging between life and
[34:09] death I say this to you and I feel this
[34:13] way I want people to be better off after
[34:16] they meet me I don't know how their
[34:22] eternal outcome will be but I want them
[34:24] to be better off after they meet me
[34:27] because I touch their lives
[34:32] I look back in my life and I look at
[34:42] certain things that God has allowed to
[34:44] be a part of and there's been some
[34:47] incredible special things that he's
[34:48] allowed brother guido that just went to
[34:52] be with the Lord
[34:53] Matthew was standing there when when all
[34:57] of that happened with brother guido
[35:00] Andrew and brother Alden was standing
[35:02] just feet away when I spoke to brother
[35:06] Guido in South Carolina and I called all
[35:09] the preachers for a prayer line I called
[35:12] the preachers to pray for them
[35:14] well that was a different kind of prayer
[35:17] line it's the way I felt to pray that
[35:18] not because if we can get preachers
[35:21] right with God remember pray for the
[35:27] ministry they're just like you all they
[35:31] fight battles and they fight tests don't
[35:39] cease to pray for us just in a few words
[35:45] brother Guido was told that evening said
[35:49] you've got a letter in your in your
[35:52] briefcase and that letter has attacked
[35:56] you pay no attention to it didn't that
[35:59] runt
[36:01] then brother Isaiah Brooks came and then
[36:04] others came and others came there was a
[36:06] sister sitting about work sister Kirsten
[36:08] Zach and God just called her name
[36:10] exactly what was going on told her what
[36:12] was happening in her life who did that
[36:15] God did that
[36:17] that don't make me any bored that don't
[36:19] even buy my coffee are you with me
[36:23] brother man see if you can only realize
[36:24] put your finger in a bucket of water
[36:26] pull it out that's how important you are
[36:29] but God gave gifts into the body could
[36:32] be a blessing to you then then brother
[36:36] guido comes at the end of the meeting
[36:38] and he's coming down I believe was on
[36:40] Friday night and he comes down he comes
[36:42] to the back and and ones are being
[36:45] prayed for behind the curtains and this
[36:47] miracle that miracle that miracle matter
[36:49] your sister was prayed for and and so
[36:52] and so in that and then brother Terry
[36:54] brother Terry brother Joe's
[36:57] brother-in-law he's standing there I've
[36:59] known him in church I've known him for
[37:01] decades and he's just kind of set just
[37:03] one of the good old boys but what it
[37:05] really needed was Jesus let me just say
[37:09] this it's all right to be a good old boy
[37:11] but what good old boys need is Jesus and
[37:14] when he was standing there and he saw
[37:16] all of those things happen and he just
[37:18] melted in that presence and God did a
[37:21] work for him he would find out he had
[37:24] cancer tonight he lays at the point of
[37:27] death without a miracle I want you to
[37:29] know tonight God knew it before he would
[37:32] ever go into battle
[37:37] I turned and brother Dewayne Jackson was
[37:43] standing there with his wife and we
[37:45] begin to pray for them and that boys now

[37:50] his second by now been running from the
[37:52] call for 17 years said he preached an
[37:57] hour his first sermon and said it was a
[37:59] glorious service by the way brother Tim

[38:06] Branham said just preach 45 minutes and
[38:09] he said well that's nice let me show you

[38:16] preach to believers all night long so he
[38:23] said what I'm gonna do for you is about
[38:25] after 45 minutes I'll just dismiss the
[38:28] unbelievers
[38:43] brother guido steps up i begin to speak
[38:47] to him and I said ghido
[38:49] and he's a friend I said greedo's
[38:52] brother guido trouble lays right in your
[38:54] path and I said and I also say there's
[39:00] someone that's going to call you a liar

[40:26] have too many critics here but I'll just
[40:29] take care of it and I'm walking off of
[40:33] the platform in Switzerland and as I'm
[40:37] walking over the platform I walk by
[40:40] Joshua and Joshua hit guiteau's son is
[40:44] standing there and he's standing right
[40:46] here and he's a good-looking man and
[40:48] he's standing there and he's just

[41:09] just standing there operating this a
[41:11] deacon and I walked by and I said and I
[41:15] just stepped back to him and I said and
[41:17] what you're asking for tonight is a
[41:19] supernatural experience with God you're
[41:24] a believer but you're asking for God to
[41:26] come on the scene and supernaturally
[41:29] touch your life and I pray for him and
[41:31] he just went right in the floor
[41:35] on another night I walked past Joshua
[41:39] this would be a couple years later and I
[41:42] walked past him you know these stories
[41:44] you've heard him over and over and I
[41:46] walk past Joshua and I turned to her and
[41:48] I said Jacque you up the same God that
[41:52] spoke to me a few years ago about you
[41:54] needing the Holy Ghost is telling me now
[41:56] that you're a preacher and you're caught
[42:01] for purpose and they walk I want just a
[42:10] few feet I walked just a few feet and
[42:16] brother ed Bisco has run around the
[42:20] building and he's standing there and
[42:24] he's got a situation to which I can't go
[42:27] in tonight but he'd spent 12 years
[42:30] trying to get a piece of real estate
[42:33] something to be taking care of lawyers

[43:08] Switzerland what will you be remembered
[43:10] for and he's listening to that service
[43:13] and he said that's not brother Ron
[43:16] that's God
[43:19] and he said I said in that presence and
[43:22] in his horizon of the Sun setting just
[43:25] in the office on the platform and
[43:27] sitting in a chair watching brother
[43:29] Brennan preach and he said I recognize
[43:31] that presence that's him not leave him
[43:37] and he ran around the building and and
[43:40] he and he clocked me just before I went
[43:42] out and and he cried Minh said a brought
[43:45] his daughter Linda and his wife sister
[43:47] Ruth and he just said to have a need and
[43:49] just said a few words and we went to
[43:52] prayer and the words that were prayed in
[43:56] that prayer
[43:58] gave him specific instruction in 90 days
[44:04] it was over with was that service
[44:15] important that same Joshua sent me a
[44:26] note this morning and it was a song I
[44:29] sent it to my family but the German you
[44:33] may be able to show it tomorrow evening
[44:34] before service it's about to train the
[44:41] journey of your life and he sent it to
[44:44] his entire family just before going to
[44:49] North Carolina when I watched that I
[44:53] thought I'm sitting there and tears just
[44:57] started running out of my eyes
[44:58] I remember sitting on a train with Dido
[45:08] Gaeta was like brother Homer he just
[45:11] took off and all I did was follow his
[45:14] white head I seem to get lost going
[45:19] through the tunnels of the trains of
[45:20] Europe and but I just I just follow him
[45:24] he never looked back he was like Homer
[45:26] he never looked back
[45:27] homers always way out in front of you
[45:30] and you was doing your best to keep up
[45:32] and and that was the way Guiteau was
[45:35] Guiteau was a man's man like brother
[45:37] Homer is a man's man I think man ought
[45:40] to be real men there was two kids with
[45:45] us I was trying to keep them up one was
[45:48] from Arizona and one was from New
[45:50] Zealand and they're with us and they got
[45:52] their bags they've they've just been at
[45:54] the same meeting we've been at one is a
[45:57] backslidden preacher's son er a
[46:00] backslidden boy grandson of brother
[46:02] Derek Donaldson and he's there and the
[46:06] cruise line that he worked for had sent
[46:09] him to Switzerland for four for a
[46:11] training session and he had the weekend
[46:13] off so he came to the meeting he was
[46:16] making his way back toward New Zealand
[46:18] really had not got a supernatural touch
[46:20] through the meeting just things that
[46:22] begin to kind of come together he was
[46:25] sitting with this girl and she's looking
[46:26] for her place and one of them's going to
[46:29] set with me one's going to set with
[46:31] brother Dido and as we're arranging
[46:32] herself on the train I said no you two
[46:35] need to set together and you need to you
[46:38] need to know each other you need to
[46:40] learn who each other is because you're
[46:42] gonna need it for this life journey
[46:45] those two kids got married brother Roy
[46:55] they came to your house and made a phone
[46:58] call to me you remember those kids God
[47:09] knows it's a great big world but it's
[47:10] really small
[47:16] you say goddess if God sends you he'll
[47:19] take care of you sorry I got sidetracked
[47:32] there for a moment here's what I want to
[47:41] tell you and all of that in guiteau's
[47:47] last meeting he sent me the picture of
[47:52] one of the orphan girls that was in the
[47:56] orphanage that when he went there and
[47:59] one of those little children walked up
[48:01] and said I really want to go home and he
[48:07] said honey if you pray Jesus will give
[48:11] you a let me remember him telling that
[48:13] story here yeah I know he was difficult
[48:16] to understand but English was his second
[48:20] language third language fourth language
[48:22] and he did his best for us and and he
[48:28] said honey if you'll pray and the people
[48:30] came to him said you can't promise that
[48:32] they'll go home he say I'm telling you
[48:34] God's going to empty this orphanage and
[48:39] he began to pray and he prayed for every
[48:41] one of them because Oliver wanted to go
[48:42] home and families to come back to him
[48:45] and one by one families came to get
[48:48] children
[48:56] and emptied that entire orphanage in
[49:01] Siberia with me listen those train rides
[49:08] were incredibly difficult he wasn't
[49:10] riding in first class four days on a
[49:14] plane is a long time coal trains on his
[49:22] last meeting one of those girls is there
[49:28] and he takes a picture and he sends it
[49:31] to me and he said brother Ron here's one
[49:33] of the girls from the orphanage and he
[49:37] just says what is the chance she'd be in
[49:40] one of my meetings I like those odds in
[49:48] one of those services there was a girl
[49:50] that said I want a horse and I am and
[49:55] and and she said I think I'm going to
[49:57] write President Putin and see if he'll
[50:00] give me a horse she said I'm gonna go
[50:03] the highest authority I can't afford one
[50:05] I can't afford to buy one maybe he'll
[50:08] give me one and whether they don't owner
[50:11] said you're a daughter of God just ask
[50:14] and she said the President of Russia
[50:20] said the President of Russia letter this
[50:25] is a girl that can't the tech can't
[50:27] can't afford to buy one but she's a
[50:31] daughter of God and she sends the
[50:34] President of Russia a letter and I got
[50:39] the printer at home she's standing there
[50:41] with that big black horse
[50:56] all I know is God spoke to that man to
[51:00] take that horse and give it to that
[51:02] little girl because a man named Dido
[51:05] inspired her that she would take God's
[51:08] Word and ask what you will and it shall
[51:11] be done unto you glory to God glory to
[51:33] God
[51:34] authority clarity with character I'm
[51:44] sorry I'll get off of it just a moment
[51:46] but you remember the last time that he
[51:47] walked at this pulpit he got down on his
[51:50] knees and he said I've came all this way
[51:53] let me remember he got down on his knees
[51:56] he raised his hands at God and he said I
[51:59] came here to be prayed for
[52:24] I don't know why I'm here but I'm here
[52:29] the first time he came here the Lord
[52:37] spoke to me that don't have him preach
[52:39] he's not physically able having
[52:42] testified and he testified for two hours
[52:47] how many how many remember that service
[52:49] on Monday we went up on the Shenandoah
[52:54] Valley and we were sitting at big
[52:56] matters and was out on there was I don't

[53:29] kind of goes back like this he put his
[53:31] hammer his head and he said other Ronnie
[53:33] I have one question I've always wanted
[53:35] to ask I've always wanted to ask a man
[53:38] like you I've got one question one
[53:41] and he said this one question I've
[53:43] always been afraid to ask I know I I
[53:47] just need to ask somebody and he just
[53:50] it's just I mean Who am I and I said you
[53:54] know let's just let's just sit down here
[53:56] just for a moment because I could tell
[53:57] it was a very serious moment and we just
[54:00] sat down in the chairs and he's sitting
[54:02] here and I'm sitting there and my knees
[54:04] touching his meeting and I said before
[54:09] you go home brother Guido let me tell
[54:12] you what your question is you were there
[54:19] and I told you though what he's question
[54:22] was can you be forgiven for a certain
[54:27] situation and I said ghido just to let
[54:32] you know it's God and I'm not reading
[54:33] your mind I said your best friend his
[54:36] name was Eddie
[54:39] he went my god like I'd like my God my
[54:42] God my God and I said you're forgiven
[54:46] Guiteau
[54:47] the blood of Jesus Christ forgave you
[54:52] are you with me
[55:00] oh my god to drop that by what authority
[55:10] do you do these things God dropped
[55:36] hope that was all right
[55:56] other than the Senate and the gospel
[55:58] isn't word only but through power and
[56:06] manifestation of the Holy Spirit which
[56:09] would produce the signs of mark 16 when
[56:13] he said go into all the world and preach
[56:17] the gospel to every creature these signs
[56:22] shall follow them the word itself is
[56:26] dead until it becomes an action comes
[56:30] into an action and produces life this
[56:36] can lay on your on your table at home
[56:39] and it can lay there dead until you
[56:43] bring it to life it wasn't me that can
[56:53] lay there dead until you bring it to
[56:55] life brother Chris that's not going to
[56:59] come back and rapture this he's not
[57:04] going to come back and wrap through this
[57:07] in the tribulation periods when the new
[57:10] world when the world is burned up diesel
[57:15] these will be a part of all of that and
[57:17] go back to their chemicals this is what
[57:20] he's coming to rapture
[57:24] [Applause]
[57:36] revelations 3 in verse 12
[57:40] to him that overcometh will i make a
[57:45] pillar in the temple of my god and he
[57:50] shall go no more out and i will write
[57:54] upon him the name of my god and the name
[57:58] of the city of my god which is the New
[58:02] Jerusalem which cometh down from out of
[58:05] heaven from my god and I will write upon
[58:09] him my new name he that hath an ear let
[58:13] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[58:16] churches to you revelations 3 and 20
[58:20] behold I stand at the door and lock and
[58:23] If any man hear my voice and open the
[58:27] door I will come in to him and brother
[58:32] Brandon when he preaches these
[58:34] scriptures he goes through the whole
[58:35] church Ages when he comes to these
[58:37] scriptures Jesus is on the outside of
[58:41] the door and he said the denomination's
[58:45] has put him out how did they put him out
[58:49] with their creeds and the dogmas don't
[58:57] want to ask you by what authority did he
[58:59] do that they still got their big
[59:02] churches they've got their programs but
[59:06] God's prophet stood there like Amos
[59:09] stood and wept over Jerusalem like David
[59:15] stood there like the Prophet stood there
[59:17] and declared the Word of God and then
[59:19] God vindicated the word I listened to a
[59:28] service today I brother Andrew and I
[59:32] listened to one yesterday there are
[59:35] certain parts of it
[59:38] as brother branham was preaching i'd say
[59:42] if you were sitting in some of those
[59:43] churches you probably felt like hello
[59:47] things was getting right up in here are
[59:52] you with me
[59:56] but that wasn't just a man speaking God
[1:00:00] was using that vessel and he was
[1:00:04] speaking a bride into existence and by
[1:00:08] that authority we take the Word of God
[1:00:10] and we preach it and it becomes alive
[1:00:13] inside of you are you with me not that
[1:00:17] we're bringing you a new thought or a
[1:00:20] new revival or a new beginnings
[1:00:23] but we're delivering the word unto you
[1:00:25] and stirring up your line by remembrance
[1:00:27] and that word has authority to you and
[1:00:31] it becomes the life
[1:00:33] you remember brother Branham would tell
[1:00:36] about a police officer kind of reminds
[1:00:38] you of Barney Fife how that he will he
[1:00:40] will talk about it said he's so skinny
[1:00:42] can hardly hold his his close up and he
[1:00:45] walks out there he said that man
[1:00:46] physically puts his hand out he couldn't
[1:00:49] stop a bicycle but because he has on a
[1:00:54] badge he's got the authority of the
[1:00:59] entire city hall and all the government
[1:01:02] of that city he puts his hand up in the
[1:01:05] biggest bus in the city comes to a
[1:01:07] screeching heart because he has
[1:01:11] authority and because you're a son of
[1:01:17] God
[1:01:21] sure other people have trouble sure
[1:01:25] other people have problems sure other
[1:01:27] people have victories in their life but
[1:01:29] because you're a son of God that ever
[1:01:33] comes into your home and he starts
[1:01:35] burning it up recognize what's going on
[1:01:37] this is the devil
[1:01:39] I rebuke the devil in the name of Jesus
[1:01:43] Christ I rebuke him and you stand and
[1:01:47] you take the word and you begin to shout
[1:01:49] and you magenta listen you don't have to
[1:01:57] take everything that comes along I
