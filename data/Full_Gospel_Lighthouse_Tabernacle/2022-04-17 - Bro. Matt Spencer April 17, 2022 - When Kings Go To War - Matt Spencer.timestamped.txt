[1:13:46] dear heavenly father lord we thank you

[1:13:50] this easter morning

[1:13:56] have received you within our hearts lord
[1:13:59] and we're looking for you lord lord we
[1:14:01] can feel your presence even so near
[1:14:03] right now lord and lord we ask you that
[1:14:05] you'll just fill us

[1:14:12] i ask you to just move on the scene for
[1:14:14] him this morning oh god i ask you that
[1:14:16] you'll just bless the the word that's
[1:14:18] been read this morning i ask you to just
[1:14:21] help it just fall upon good ground this
[1:14:23] morning in jesus name we pray these
[1:14:25] things
[1:14:26] amen amen amen you can be seated this
[1:14:29] morning
[1:14:45] amen like i said he is the lord mighty
[1:14:47] in battle this morning
[1:14:49] so this morning i'd like to speak on
[1:14:51] when kings go to war
[1:14:55] when kings go to war
[1:14:56] he said i will fight your battles
[1:15:00] i will make thy foes thy footstool i'll
[1:15:02] put you i'll put them under my feet
[1:15:06] in a natural realm we
[1:15:08] we're living in a day where there is war
[1:15:11] in ukraine
[1:15:13] when there is
[1:15:15] war that has been preceded
[1:15:17] by an evil man
[1:15:19] a man that
[1:15:21] he is beginning
[1:15:22] become old in age and so what old kings
[1:15:25] seem to do in their older age they want
[1:15:27] to take more land
[1:15:29] they want to take possessions
[1:15:31] and try to do things that they haven't
[1:15:32] been able to achieve as they get older
[1:15:35] because their sea they see their day as
[1:15:36] ending they see their day is coming
[1:15:39] closer
[1:15:41] so you hear the drum beat of war
[1:15:43] you hear it as it's as it begins to
[1:15:45] pound
[1:15:47] even here in the u.s
[1:15:48] now we're not there we're not over there
[1:15:50] we're not fighting that war but we can
[1:15:52] feel that war
[1:15:54] we can feel that pressure that is upon
[1:15:56] us
[1:15:57] even people will run to churches when
[1:15:59] war begins to happen oh russia
[1:16:02] the prophet spoke of russia maybe this
[1:16:05] is the time and they'll run to churches
[1:16:07] but maybe this isn't the war that we're
[1:16:09] thinking that'll draw us away in a
[1:16:11] moment of twinkling of eye
[1:16:13] and soon they'll be gone
[1:16:14] you won't see those people no more after
[1:16:17] the war is done and over with it was
[1:16:18] just something that was just on their
[1:16:20] flesh and not on their heart
[1:16:23] so you'll hear hear the drum beats of
[1:16:25] war and you'll feel them
[1:16:27] now we see
[1:16:28] war is mainly waged in the springtime
[1:16:32] and that is due to health of soldiers
[1:16:36] because if you're waging it in the
[1:16:38] wintertime
[1:16:39] hey it's hard to march thousands and
[1:16:41] troops and tanks and everything through
[1:16:43] snow and ice and all this so we see as
[1:16:46] spring is approaching war is getting
[1:16:49] nearer or even worse
[1:16:52] and we've seen that on the natural
[1:16:55] but also on the spiritual
[1:16:57] so we see that this this dark age is
[1:17:00] starting to become more and more and
[1:17:03] more and we hear that drum beat of war
[1:17:04] coming closer and closer because satan
[1:17:07] is trying to do what he can
[1:17:10] while he has time
[1:17:11] but he only has a season to work
[1:17:14] amen
[1:17:16] i'd like to read this and
[1:17:18] brother branham
[1:17:20] says it like this and says finally a man
[1:17:23] that should have that should never be
[1:17:25] forgotten
[1:17:26] as long as there is a switzerland by the
[1:17:28] name of arnold runwinkler
[1:17:30] he stepped out in the front
[1:17:32] of a little army and he said men of
[1:17:34] switzerland
[1:17:35] this day i will give my life for
[1:17:38] switzerland
[1:17:39] and this day
[1:17:41] i shall conquer
[1:17:43] and he said over yonders in the hills is
[1:17:46] a little white house
[1:17:48] a sweet loving wife and three children
[1:17:51] and i told them goodbye
[1:17:53] i'd be back after a little while
[1:17:56] but i will never see them again
[1:18:00] on this earth for i must give my life
[1:18:03] for switzerland this day
[1:18:06] and they said arnold van gaal
[1:18:08] what will you do
[1:18:10] and he turned towards the oncoming army
[1:18:13] and he looked over it all
[1:18:16] and he found the darkest in the midst of
[1:18:18] spears that there was
[1:18:21] and he had a stick
[1:18:24] just imagine that a man like this
[1:18:26] carrying just a stick to go after his
[1:18:28] enemies
[1:18:30] just like shamgar would with an ox goat
[1:18:33] with a stick
[1:18:34] satan you didn't bring enough this
[1:18:36] morning
[1:18:37] you ain't got enough this morning
[1:18:39] we got more than a stick with us this
[1:18:41] morning we got the word of the lord the
[1:18:43] sword of the spirit with us this morning
[1:18:45] amen
[1:18:48] and he threw it down and he said follow
[1:18:50] me and fight with all you've got
[1:18:53] with what you have fight with it and he
[1:18:55] threw away his stick
[1:18:57] threw out of his hands and he screamed
[1:18:59] out make way for liberty make way for
[1:19:03] liberty
[1:19:04] and he rushed towards the greatest bunch
[1:19:06] of spears
[1:19:07] hundred shining spears reached out and
[1:19:10] he picked them
[1:19:11] and plunged them and grabbed them into
[1:19:13] his arms and threw him into his bosom
[1:19:16] and he screamed out make way for liberty
[1:19:19] with such a display of heroism it routed
[1:19:22] it rooted the army
[1:19:24] and those men that followed there behind
[1:19:26] them were sticks and clubs and they beat
[1:19:29] out that army in their land
[1:19:31] and they never had a war since
[1:19:34] make way for liberty as he screamed in
[1:19:37] the darkness of the spears in the
[1:19:39] darkness of the hour
[1:19:41] he threw himself into battle
[1:19:46] and because of his heroism
[1:19:49] and about to be the conqueror
[1:19:53] many of years ago in the swell salps
[1:19:56] and i speak to you today as he ran down
[1:20:00] i appreciate the mighty arnold von
[1:20:02] winkler as he says here
[1:20:08] now this is what i like here of this
[1:20:09] story here it says
[1:20:11] and that display of heroism
[1:20:14] was seldom being compared with one never
[1:20:16] exchanged but all such a little thing
[1:20:20] to one day when adam's race had been
[1:20:22] backed in a corner
[1:20:24] and god had sent prophets
[1:20:28] they killed them righteous men and they
[1:20:31] had stoned them and the devil's oncoming
[1:20:33] army had atoms raised back into a corner
[1:20:37] without hope without god without mercy
[1:20:40] and without anything
[1:20:42] sicknesses diseases ignorance
[1:20:45] they were just hopeless
[1:20:47] there wasn't nothing that could help
[1:20:48] them
[1:20:50] but there was one that stepped out of
[1:20:51] heaven
[1:20:53] one that stepped out of heaven
[1:20:55] and he said i must go father
[1:20:59] and i will give my life for adam's
[1:21:01] fallen race
[1:21:03] and he came to the earth and lived for
[1:21:05] 33 years
[1:21:07] and he looked it over and he found out
[1:21:10] where men's greatest fear was
[1:21:14] and it was death that was at the center
[1:21:16] of it
[1:21:18] now watch what he did
[1:21:20] he ran to calvary he pressed the swords
[1:21:23] right into his own bosom the swords of
[1:21:26] death
[1:21:27] and he sent the holy spirit back to the
[1:21:29] day of pentecost
[1:21:31] and by this we are to conquer the world
[1:21:35] and follow him as our hero of our
[1:21:38] blessing this morning
[1:21:40] he conquered death he conquered the
[1:21:42] greatest fear that was on this earth
[1:21:44] that was death that would hold you bound
[1:21:46] o death where is thy sting oh grave
[1:21:49] where is thy victory
[1:21:51] oh hallelujah aren't you glad that he

[1:26:39] due to what they produced
[1:26:41] not just something they produced but
[1:26:42] what the word has produced
[1:26:44] something that laid on the inside of you
[1:26:46] from the foundation of the world and
[1:26:48] these men have searched out through all
[1:26:50] ages
[1:26:52] now there's more men that i could say
[1:26:54] and i could go on what they've preached
[1:26:56] how that they've brought forth the word
[1:26:57] but i'm just bringing these this morning
[1:26:59] is
[1:27:00] what they did
[1:27:01] now most of you know them now what they
[1:27:03] did for you
[1:27:04] what's been laying on the inside of you
[1:27:07] they were kings that stood up for you
[1:27:09] they were kings that went to war for you
[1:27:12] they fight for you they die for you
[1:27:14] your children
[1:27:16] how they've went and they've stayed up
[1:27:17] in the middle of the nights praying for
[1:27:19] your sick children your lost loved ones
[1:27:22] they're kings that have went to war for
[1:27:24] you this morning
[1:27:25] they'll still go to war for you if
[1:27:27] something happens to brother ron brother
[1:27:29] andrew will go to war for you if
[1:27:31] something happens to brother andrew i'll
[1:27:33] go to war for you if something happens
[1:27:35] brother william we'll all go to war
[1:27:37] together
[1:27:38] amen but one of these days we're going
[1:27:40] to be called away in a moment of the
[1:27:42] twinkling of an eye
[1:27:44] amen
[1:27:46] we're kings
[1:27:47] we're kings this morning we're queens
[1:27:49] this morning
[1:27:53] as brother william was preaching last
[1:27:54] night we've been sealed
[1:27:56] we've been given this covenant this
[1:27:57] morning it's been dovetailed together as
[1:28:00] he was speaking of the covenant that
[1:28:01] abraham was putting together that
[1:28:04] covenant that has been dovetailed
[1:28:06] together that light that brought
[1:28:08] together all of the burnt offerings
[1:28:11] that was sanctified that god said
[1:28:14] is accepted
[1:28:16] we've been sealed this morning
[1:28:18] but not anything we could do it's what
[1:28:20] god did
[1:28:22] it's nothing these men of men of god
[1:28:24] could do it's what he did through them
[1:28:26] amen
[1:28:28] so if we have a king
[1:28:30] our king lord jesus christ
[1:28:33] he's going to have a kingdom
[1:28:35] he says in john 14 and 28 29
[1:28:38] it says
[1:28:40] ye have heard now
[1:28:42] i said
[1:28:45] unto you i go away
[1:28:47] and i come again unto you
[1:28:50] now he's went away
[1:28:51] he went away to prepare a place but he's
[1:28:54] coming back but if he's prepared a place
[1:28:57] there means there is a kingdom
[1:29:00] and if there is a kingdom there must be
[1:29:02] a people
[1:29:03] and if there's a people there must be a
[1:29:05] bride to rule and reign and to live in
[1:29:08] this morning
[1:29:09] he's fighting for you the king has went
[1:29:11] to war for you this morning
[1:29:14] there's all kinds of things in the
[1:29:16] kingdom
[1:29:20] but before before he had a kingdom he
[1:29:23] went to war
[1:29:25] he went to battle
[1:29:28] and as brother william was speaking last
[1:29:30] night talking about
[1:29:31] a choosing place for battle
[1:29:35] god and satan
[1:29:37] was choosing a place for a battleground
[1:29:41] and brother branham says in jesus christ
[1:29:43] the same yesterday and today and forever
[1:29:45] it says in the garden of eden satan
[1:29:47] chose his part of the man
[1:29:50] satan chose his part of the man that he
[1:29:52] wanted to do war in
[1:29:54] his head his intelligence
[1:29:56] but god took the heart
[1:29:59] as brother william was speaking last
[1:30:00] night god took that heart
[1:30:02] god took that so that
[1:30:04] even through all of the reasonings that
[1:30:05] would go on here
[1:30:07] god could live right here
[1:30:09] satan would stand behind you i
[1:30:12] i was praying brother william don't
[1:30:13] preach at all
[1:30:14] leave me some
[1:30:17] as satan would stand behind you and talk
[1:30:20] to you here and then come over here and
[1:30:22] talk to and say what a bad person you
[1:30:24] are
[1:30:25] but see that's where the devil chose to
[1:30:27] work at in the reasoning
[1:30:30] in the intelligence
[1:30:32] the intelligence the reason
[1:30:34] the why will well i'm this way and i'm
[1:30:36] that way
[1:30:38] you'll never get anywhere with god there
[1:30:41] but your heart
[1:30:43] your faith will make you to believe
[1:30:45] things that your mind knows nothing
[1:30:47] about
[1:30:48] and you cast down that reasoning see you
[1:30:51] must be positive you must stay there
[1:30:53] until you are positive
[1:30:55] and then when there is positive
[1:30:57] there's nothing that can turn you amen
[1:31:01] when there's positive there is nothing
[1:31:04] nothing nothing nothing that can turn
[1:31:07] you this morning because it's here on
[1:31:09] the heart
[1:31:10] jesus on the inside he's on the heart
[1:31:12] this morning
[1:31:13] for when he chose that battleground he
[1:31:15] knew how the battle how the battle would
[1:31:17] lay
[1:31:18] he knew the ground he done proved it he
[1:31:21] said this ground
[1:31:22] it's going to be perfect because i'm
[1:31:24] going to whip that devil anytime any
[1:31:26] place anywhere
[1:31:29] when he's laying on the inside of your
[1:31:30] heart
[1:31:32] amen
[1:31:33] this morning i'd like to turn over into
[1:31:35] genesis 14
[1:31:40] and we're speaking on
[1:31:42] when kings go to battle
[1:31:44] when kings go to war
[1:31:46] so we see how abram
[1:31:49] and lot
[1:31:51] had chose their place
[1:31:53] after they had separated
[1:31:55] see lot
[1:31:56] he pitched his tent towards sodom he
[1:31:59] said that's where i want to be because
[1:32:01] it looked good to lot
[1:32:03] it looked beautiful rivers plains it was
[1:32:06] so beautiful and abram let lot choose
[1:32:09] first
[1:32:10] he said you choose you go let there be
[1:32:13] no strife between me and thee
[1:32:16] so he chose his place
[1:32:18] he chose sodom
[1:32:19] but abram chose to stay in memory
[1:32:23] but now
[1:32:25] abram after a lot had been separated
[1:32:27] from him
[1:32:28] god blessed him
[1:32:30] he blessed him after he was separated
[1:32:32] from lot
[1:32:34] that was lot's first black sliding was
[1:32:36] where he chose to go towards sodom what
[1:32:39] what he chose to look for that was
[1:32:41] beautiful that was good
[1:32:45] amen and here in this hour we've got
[1:32:47] many that choose to look for something
[1:32:49] that's beautiful a well-spoken mannered
[1:32:51] preacher not someone rough and ruggedy
[1:32:54] but that's don't that's not what you
[1:32:56] need god will bless you
[1:32:59] let them go on
[1:33:01] so i'd like to
[1:33:02] read here over in genesis 14
[1:33:06] and you just bear with me this morning
[1:33:08] if i call if i don't have a cold i don't
[1:33:09] know the names
[1:33:11] amen
[1:33:14] hallelujah
[1:33:17] amen
[1:33:20] and it came to pass in the days of
[1:33:22] hammerfell king of shinar arnot king of
[1:33:25] elazar
[1:33:26] ketterleam king of elm and title king of
[1:33:29] nations that these made war with beer a
[1:33:32] king of sodom and beershaw king of
[1:33:34] gomorrah sinab king of atma and she
[1:33:38] member king of zoboyum and king of bilah
[1:33:42] which was zoar hallelujah got through
[1:33:44] that part of the scriptures
[1:33:46] amen
[1:33:52] so these kings were preparing for war
[1:33:56] and these were joined together in the
[1:33:58] veil of sidom which is the salt sea
[1:34:01] twelve years they served killer limb in
[1:34:04] the 13th year now they rebelled so we
[1:34:07] see abram has been in memory for about
[1:34:09] 13 years
[1:34:11] and these kings now are preparing to go
[1:34:14] to war
[1:34:15] near sodom
[1:34:18] and all those that are around sodom
[1:34:21] and ketterlae and in the fourteenth year
[1:34:23] came catalina the king
[1:34:25] and the kings that were with them and
[1:34:27] smote the wrathiums the asteroths of
[1:34:31] cartham
[1:34:32] and the zuzim's ham and the eminem's of
[1:34:35] shaven cartham
[1:34:36] and the horror nights and their an
[1:34:38] amount of seerah and el porn
[1:34:41] which is by the wilderness and they were
[1:34:44] turned and came at miss pad which is
[1:34:47] kadesh and they smote all the in the
[1:34:50] country of the amalekites and also the
[1:34:52] amorites that dwell in hazon tamar and
[1:34:56] there went out the king of sodom the
[1:34:59] king of gomorrah and the king of atmos
[1:35:02] the king of zuboyum the king of billah
[1:35:05] which is saint zaar
[1:35:07] and they joined battle and they came in
[1:35:09] the veil of sidom
[1:35:11] with
[1:35:12] ketterleam the king of elm with title
[1:35:15] king of nations and amraphel king of
[1:35:17] shinar and arnot king of elazar four
[1:35:21] kings with five
[1:35:22] four kings with five now satan
[1:35:25] you know better than bringing too little
[1:35:27] once again
[1:35:33] amen
[1:35:37] and the veil of sidom was full of slime
[1:35:40] pits
[1:35:41] and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled
[1:35:44] and there and remained and fled to the
[1:35:47] mountain so now solomon gomorrah where
[1:35:50] lot has been
[1:35:52] has been overthrown by these kings of
[1:35:54] catalan
[1:36:00] and they took all the goods of sodom and
[1:36:03] gomorrah and their rituals and went
[1:36:05] their way
[1:36:06] and they took a lot abram's brother's
[1:36:09] son and dwelt in solemn who dwelt in
[1:36:12] sodom
[1:36:13] his goods and departed and there came
[1:36:15] one
[1:36:16] that had escaped and told abram the
[1:36:19] hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of
[1:36:21] memory the amorite brother of ishkul
[1:36:25] brother of anar and these were
[1:36:27] confederate with abram
[1:36:29] and when abram heard that his brother
[1:36:31] was taken captive he armed his trained
[1:36:34] servants born in his own house
[1:36:37] 318
[1:36:39] and pursued them unto dan
[1:36:42] and he divided himself against he and
[1:36:45] his servants by night and smoked them
[1:36:47] and pursued them even unto hubba
[1:36:50] which is left hand of damascus and he
[1:36:53] brought back
[1:36:55] all the goods and also brought again his
[1:36:58] brother lot and his goods and the women
[1:37:01] also and the people now we see abram
[1:37:04] they didn't call abram the king
[1:37:08] he he wasn't the king
[1:37:10] but see
[1:37:12] all those people
[1:37:14] here that had went to battle were called
[1:37:17] kings
[1:37:18] but they called abram the hebrew
[1:37:21] i'd rather be called the hebrew i'd
[1:37:23] rather be called the christian this
[1:37:24] morning
[1:37:25] i'd rather be called that than a king of
[1:37:28] a world that will fall
[1:37:31] and so
[1:37:32] abram took and he went
[1:37:35] after lot
[1:37:37] and he conquered there
[1:37:39] that stupid devil
[1:37:42] why in the world do you think that you
[1:37:45] could take one of ours
[1:37:47] why do you think
[1:37:48] that you could come in and steal our joy
[1:37:51] still our peace still our children
[1:37:54] there's kings that are here this morning
[1:37:56] that is willing to fight for you
[1:37:58] they'd go to the end of the world for
[1:38:00] you and that's what abram did
[1:38:02] he said
[1:38:03] you done messed up
[1:38:05] he he went there and they they caused
[1:38:08] them to fall in the slime pits
[1:38:10] but abram went and he conquered
[1:38:13] abram conquered
[1:38:15] there and he took back all but i want
[1:38:17] you to see what what he did when he
[1:38:19] brought it all back
[1:38:21] now he done conquered all those kings
[1:38:23] that had went together and defeated all
[1:38:25] of sodom and gomorrah
[1:38:27] and he brought
[1:38:28] back he brought it back all the goods
[1:38:31] and also bring again his brother lot and
[1:38:33] his goods and the women and also the
[1:38:35] people
[1:38:37] and the king of sodom went out to meet
[1:38:39] him
[1:38:40] and he didn't go down with abram to help
[1:38:42] him fight this battle he said no we
[1:38:45] don't been whooped i don't want to be
[1:38:47] associated with you but he did

[1:39:49] delivered thine enemies into the unhand
[1:39:51] and gave
[1:39:53] and abram then gave ties
[1:39:55] of all
[1:39:56] he get ties of all
[1:39:59] right away
[1:40:01] right away given ties to all of what he
[1:40:03] had conquered there
[1:40:05] but the king of sodom said unto abram
[1:40:08] give me the persons
[1:40:10] give me the persons and and maybe you
[1:40:13] take the goods i just want the persons
[1:40:17] and abram said to the king of sodom i've
[1:40:19] lifted up my hand unto the lord the most
[1:40:22] high god the possessor of heaven and
[1:40:24] earth that i will not take
[1:40:26] from the thread even the shulaishi
[1:40:29] that i will not take anything that is
[1:40:32] thine lest thou should have say
[1:40:35] i have made abram rich
[1:40:37] see he knew what the king of sodom would
[1:40:39] have done
[1:40:40] he just said
[1:40:42] abram's not blessed
[1:40:44] i made him rich
[1:40:46] you're not blessed i've made you rich oh
[1:40:49] no he said not a chance sodom not a
[1:40:52] chance
[1:40:54] he said
[1:40:55] take it all you just just
[1:40:57] take it all all back but
[1:41:00] look
[1:41:01] look what lot
[1:41:02] did he had already
[1:41:05] been brought out of that war
[1:41:08] he had been held captive
[1:41:10] and abram went and got him saved him but
[1:41:13] he went right back into sodom
[1:41:16] right back from where abram had unsaved
[1:41:19] him from
[1:41:20] now why in the thunder would you want to
[1:41:22] go back to what you've been saved from
[1:41:26] why
[1:41:27] there ain't nothing there to go back for
[1:41:31] nothing
[1:41:34] amen
[1:41:49] but look what happens
[1:41:51] after all of this
[1:41:54] the lord comes
[1:41:55] and blesses abram even more
[1:41:58] even more than he had before
[1:42:01] he had blessed him when he was in memory
[1:42:04] he had blessed him there
[1:42:05] no war no nothing had come against abram
[1:42:09] but he said i'm going to bless you
[1:42:11] he says fear not i am thy shield and thy
[1:42:16] exceedingly
[1:42:17] exceedingly great reward this morning
[1:42:21] and he blessed him he made a covenant
[1:42:23] with abraham for blessed is going to be
[1:42:26] yours
[1:42:26] you're going to be kings and priests
[1:42:29] you're going to have loins that'll come
[1:42:30] out that are kings and priests
[1:42:33] blessed are you
[1:42:35] so we see how
[1:42:37] how now abraham is even blessed even
[1:42:40] more and he said i'm going to bless you
[1:42:43] i'm going to bless sarah
[1:42:45] but see they they took things into their
[1:42:47] own hands there for a little bit and
[1:42:49] they produced ishmael through hagar
[1:42:54] but god god came back down to him
[1:42:58] god came down to him
[1:43:00] years later now he's still in memory
[1:43:02] he's he's still there
[1:43:06] and a lot is still in sodom
[1:43:10] now
[1:43:12] he said i'm going to bless you so he
[1:43:14] come by one day
[1:43:16] melchizedek
[1:43:18] most high god
[1:43:20] three angels come by there
[1:43:23] and abram ran to the tent door and said
[1:43:25] oh my lord my god
[1:43:27] oh you've stopped by my way won't you
[1:43:29] just won't you just come in and just
[1:43:32] dwell with me for a little bit this
[1:43:33] morning it's it's been a while i'm
[1:43:36] getting old stricken in aging and i'm
[1:43:38] just not seeing what you might have said
[1:43:40] there but
[1:43:42] but maybe just
[1:43:43] we'll fix you a cake just feast with us
[1:43:46] here for a little bit
[1:43:47] now he blessed him
[1:43:50] and he had a name change at that point
[1:43:53] aren't you glad you've had a name change
[1:43:55] here this morning
[1:43:56] i was a sinner
[1:43:59] but now god's changed me i'm his bride
[1:44:01] this morning
[1:44:05] and so
[1:44:06] so we see how those three
[1:44:09] that had come to bless abram here
[1:44:12] but they didn't just stay there they
[1:44:14] said we have more work to do
[1:44:17] there's still somebody down there in
[1:44:18] sodom that we're going to try to bring
[1:44:20] them on out so
[1:44:22] they walked a little while with abraham
[1:44:25] and
[1:44:26] and abraham asked him what will they do
[1:44:29] he said
[1:44:31] we're going to destroy it
[1:44:32] we said what what if there's what if
[1:44:34] there's 50
[1:44:36] would you save it i'll spare it well
[1:44:38] what if there's 40
[1:44:40] i'll save it i'll spare it
[1:44:42] what if first
[1:44:44] but it got all the way down
[1:44:46] will you save it we save it if there's
[1:44:48] 10 or so
[1:44:50] i said i'll say it i'll save it
[1:44:53] so
[1:44:55] the most high
[1:44:56] walked on with abram and the two angels
[1:44:58] went down to sodom to preach them there
[1:45:02] for a little bit
[1:45:03] but
[1:45:04] sodom was so wicked
[1:45:06] so defile
[1:45:09] that the people of sodom
[1:45:11] seen the two men coming in
[1:45:13] and they went to lot and said the two
[1:45:15] men that are that are in your house
[1:45:17] bring them out
[1:45:19] we're living in a filthy age
[1:45:21] filthy age
[1:45:24] but it's got to get as bad as it was in
[1:45:25] sodom
[1:45:27] filthy
[1:45:28] that people will want to
[1:45:30] pervert
[1:45:32] with two angels
[1:45:35] but that's what the world wants to do
[1:45:36] today
[1:45:37] they don't want to hear none of this
[1:45:39] they want to pervert the word
[1:45:42] that's how filthy we're starting to
[1:45:44] become in this age it's it's becoming
[1:45:46] filth
[1:45:51] they fornicated with the word and they
[1:45:52] put off everything that they don't want
[1:45:57] they said
[1:45:58] lot prepare your household
[1:46:02] we're going to destroy it
[1:46:04] oh don't don't
[1:46:05] don't don't don't we're doing it we're
[1:46:07] going to destroy it
[1:46:10] lot even had
[1:46:11] offered his
[1:46:13] virgin daughters his virgin daughters in
[1:46:15] his house how perverted had lot even
[1:46:17] gotten
[1:46:18] how wicked had lot even gotten that he
[1:46:21] would offer his virgin daughters to the
[1:46:23] filth of the city
[1:46:27] don't take the angels you take my virgin
[1:46:29] daughters
[1:46:30] what type of filth was he living in
[1:46:34] we've been called to step out of that
[1:46:38] they said let's go
[1:46:41] so in the morning they they rose
[1:46:44] and lot still did not want to go but the
[1:46:46] angels even took and grabbed hold of lot
[1:46:49] by the hand and he pulled them
[1:46:52] pulled his house out of sodom
[1:46:56] now this is the second time that lot has
[1:46:59] been
[1:47:00] pulled out of a war out of a filth out
[1:47:03] of a battle out of captivity
[1:47:06] the second time that lot has been there
[1:47:10] but the filth had become so bad that his
[1:47:12] wife wanted to turn back
[1:47:15] and she turned back
[1:47:17] towards sodom and turned into a pillar
[1:47:19] of
[1:47:20] salt and lot said
[1:47:23] what shall i do they said go up here
[1:47:26] this is where you're going to be safe
[1:47:28] and he said well i don't want to go up
[1:47:29] there i want to go down here in zore i
[1:47:32] want to stay down here because it's in
[1:47:34] the plains
[1:47:36] and the angels
[1:47:38] okay then go then
[1:47:40] you go then okay we we won't destroy it
[1:47:43] but god remembered his his covenant with
[1:47:46] abraham
[1:47:48] he remembered his covenant
[1:47:50] he said we're still going to destroy
[1:47:53] zoroar
[1:47:54] so lot had to flee to the mountains with
[1:47:57] his two daughters now
[1:47:59] but the filth that was still there they
[1:48:01] never got rid of that backslidden
[1:48:03] condition they stayed where they was at
[1:48:06] in that backslidden condition
[1:48:09] but they thought that they were still
[1:48:10] okay but the two daughters
[1:48:13] the two virgin daughters that he had
[1:48:14] taken out
[1:48:16] they committed adultery even with lot
[1:48:18] and said we must have children
[1:48:21] we must
[1:48:22] so they got a lot drunken now this was
[1:48:25] the last straw
[1:48:26] for lot this was the last time
[1:48:29] for lot he had done backslid so much
[1:48:33] filth
[1:48:35] no more
[1:48:37] lot
[1:48:38] did everything he could to stay in that
[1:48:40] field did everything he could he pressed
[1:48:43] his way towards that
[1:48:45] but i want you to see those two
[1:48:47] daughters produced
[1:48:48] moab
[1:48:50] and i can't think of the name of the
[1:48:52] other one help me out
[1:48:54] okay

[1:49:08] moab and a bin lobby and i'm not saying
[1:49:10] that right i know
[1:49:13] through their wickedness
[1:49:15] they produce those two
[1:49:17] and we go on to read
[1:49:19] how bad moab and all them was
[1:49:22] how bad that the filth
[1:49:24] had contaminated even the seed that they
[1:49:27] would even have
[1:49:28] and how awful that they would be the
[1:49:31] moabites how they'd offer sacrifices of
[1:49:33] little girls from a young age
[1:49:37] the filth that they were living in
[1:49:43] amen
[1:49:45] see we
[1:49:46] we've got to compel
[1:49:48] compel them to come
[1:49:51] to the house of the lord this morning
[1:49:53] tell them don't wait don't wait until
[1:49:56] it's too late
[1:49:57] compel them to come
[1:50:00] we don't want a bunch of just religious
[1:50:01] fanatics that are
[1:50:03] alexander scroby that can open up the
[1:50:05] scriptures or close them and they can
[1:50:06] read it front to back put a pencil
[1:50:08] through the pages and they can read
[1:50:10] everywhere the pencil touched
[1:50:11] we don't want all of that we want sons
[1:50:14] and daughters of god that will serve the
[1:50:16] lord jesus christ no matter what comes
[1:50:19] no matter what goes
[1:50:21] amen
[1:50:23] compel them to come
[1:50:25] brother brother branham would say in the
[1:50:27] souls now in prison
[1:50:29] our christ
[1:50:31] he would go down there to souls now in
[1:50:33] prison
[1:50:36] on resurrection day and he had done
[1:50:38] taking the keys off of satan's side
[1:50:42] he said give them to me big boy i'm
[1:50:43] taking over
[1:50:45] i'm taking over and you see abraham and
[1:50:47] sarah as he's walking down through there
[1:50:50] knocks on the door
[1:50:54] sarah says who is it
[1:50:56] who is it if it's that old satan please
[1:50:58] don't open that door again he's beat me
[1:51:00] so long i'm tired of living down in here
[1:51:03] because see they were trapped there
[1:51:05] souls now in prison were trapped there
[1:51:08] because they were under the old law
[1:51:10] under the the blood of blood of sheeps
[1:51:13] and goats
[1:51:15] but now jesus christ
[1:51:17] had shed his blood for morning
[1:51:20] jesus christ had made the way
[1:51:23] took every every day a devil in hell
[1:51:26] knocked on the door
[1:51:28] abraham oh honey
[1:51:31] that's the one that met me in the tent
[1:51:33] door that day
[1:51:35] that's the one right there
[1:51:37] he's the one that saved us
[1:51:40] and he took them
[1:51:42] made some pit stops over through there
[1:51:44] took all the old prophets and said come
[1:51:46] on
[1:51:47] come on ezekiel said that's him i saw on
[1:51:49] the way up and the high in the middle of
[1:51:51] the wheel amen job seen him and said
[1:51:54] whoa i know my redeemer lives this
[1:51:56] morning
[1:51:57] amen
[1:51:58] see he took those souls that were now in
[1:52:00] prison and you might feel this morning
[1:52:03] i'm in prison i've been locked up
[1:52:06] but he has already paid the price
[1:52:09] just accept it this morning
[1:52:11] just step out on his word and accept it
[1:52:13] this morning
[1:52:14] don't be locked up in chains the chains

[1:52:18] unshackled just shake off those chains
[1:52:21] just shake them off amen
[1:52:26] so we see how
[1:52:27] moab and the moabites were created
[1:52:30] and how lot fought his way
[1:52:33] over the blood of christ
[1:52:36] to sin
[1:52:37] he fought his way over the blood over
[1:52:39] the covenant every he fought his way as
[1:52:41] hard as he could to sin
[1:52:44] but there was something
[1:52:46] that was laying on the inside that god
[1:52:48] said
[1:52:49] i have a seed
[1:52:51] even through all of that filth
[1:52:54] i have a seed there
[1:52:56] and ruth come out of that moabites
[1:53:00] ruth come out of the moabites
[1:53:03] so we see see a man that has fought his
[1:53:05] way over the blood
[1:53:07] over the blood of christ
[1:53:09] did everything under the sun
[1:53:11] to get away from it
[1:53:13] but his his lineage there was one that
[1:53:15] said oh
[1:53:17] oh trust me not to go
[1:53:19] where you go i shall go
[1:53:21] she fought her way back over that blood
[1:53:24] to christ
[1:53:25] and said i will live where you live
[1:53:28] i will die where you your god will be my
[1:53:30] god

[1:54:03] and there's still people that will trod
[1:54:05] over the blood of christ to sin you have
[1:54:08] to trod over that blood
[1:54:11] those two types and there and you will

[1:54:31] they live it for a little while
[1:54:33] no you know what this whole world it's
[1:54:36] pleasurable
[1:54:38] it is pleasurable for a season

[1:56:21] darkness that would creep in on your
[1:56:24] life
[1:56:28] so here we see
[1:56:30] what the moabites had produced
[1:56:33] in
[1:56:34] chapter 3 and verse 4
[1:56:37] in the king of moab
[1:56:40] mission and he was a sheep master and
[1:56:44] rendered to the king of israel a hundred
[1:56:46] thousand lambs and a hundred thousand
[1:56:48] rams with the wool
[1:56:52] but it came to pass when ahab was dead
[1:56:55] king of moab rebelled against the king
[1:56:57] of israel
[1:56:59] and the king of jeremiah
[1:57:01] went to samaria at the same time and
[1:57:03] numbered
[1:57:04] all of israel
[1:57:06] and it went out and sent to jehoshaphat
[1:57:09] king of judah
[1:57:12] saying the king of moab hath rebelled
[1:57:15] against me
[1:57:16] will thou go with me against moab to
[1:57:19] battle
[1:57:20] and he said i will go up
[1:57:23] i am
[1:57:24] as thou art my people
[1:57:27] as thy people and my horses as thy
[1:57:31] horses and he said which way shall we go
[1:57:34] up and he answered the way through the
[1:57:37] wilderness of edom
[1:57:40] and the king of israel went to the king
[1:57:42] of judah and the king of edom
[1:57:45] and they
[1:57:46] fetched a compass of seven days journey
[1:57:49] and there was no water for the host or
[1:57:52] for the cattle that followed them
[1:57:54] and the king of israel said alas the
[1:57:57] lord
[1:57:59] hath called these three kings together
[1:58:02] to deliver them into the king and to the
[1:58:04] hand of moab
[1:58:07] but watch here
[1:58:10] they're they're all wowzy wowsy wu
[1:58:13] we we've went into this battle we are
[1:58:14] unprepared we're not
[1:58:16] we're going to die
[1:58:17] we're going to die in this battle but
[1:58:20] watch what
[1:58:21] jehoshaphat said he said but jehoshaphat
[1:58:25] said is there not a prophet
[1:58:28] of the lord
[1:58:30] now he's starting to have a reputation
[1:58:32] for himself because he asked this before
[1:58:35] and they sent forth micah
[1:58:38] and and the king there said oh there is
[1:58:40] a man
[1:58:43] but he don't like me
[1:58:45] he tells me
[1:58:46] the truth
[1:58:48] but it's not what i want to hear
[1:58:51] so so jehoshaphat is now looking for
[1:58:54] another prophet in the land because hey
[1:58:55] that worked out pretty good that time
[1:58:57] not really
[1:59:00] didn't listen to him
[1:59:02] maybe i'll listen okay
[1:59:04] all right so
[1:59:05] there's a prophet is there a prophet of
[1:59:07] the lord in the land
[1:59:10] that we may inquire of the lord by him
[1:59:14] and the one king of israel's servants
[1:59:16] now his servant not the king the servant
[1:59:18] answered and said here is elisha the son
[1:59:22] of jacques
[1:59:25] which poured water on the hands of
[1:59:27] elijah and
[1:59:28] jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is
[1:59:31] with him
[1:59:32] so the king of israel and jehoshaphat
[1:59:34] and the king of edom went down to him
[1:59:37] and elisha said unto the king of israel
[1:59:40] what have i to do with thee
[1:59:44] elisha's talking to these kings now have
[1:59:46] come to ask his wisdom
[1:59:48] what have i to do with thee
[1:59:51] get thee back to the prophets of thy
[1:59:54] father and the prophets of thy mother
[1:59:57] and the king of israel said nay lord
[2:00:00] have called these three kings together
[2:00:02] to deliver them unto the hand of moab
[2:00:06] now you see here
[2:00:07] elisha said go back to your mom and
[2:00:10] daddy's teachings you that's what you've
[2:00:13] held held on the whole time just go back

[2:05:49] here and before a little bit it starts
[2:05:51] to raise
[2:05:53] and you can't see you no more
[2:05:56] because you've done dogs so deep that
[2:05:58] you can't see you

[2:06:13] those ditches that you're digging
[2:06:15] it might it might seem so stony so rock
[2:06:18] so hard it might be
[2:06:20] you're probably digging up on pine creek
[2:06:21] lane or miscellaneous laying there where
[2:06:23] it's nothing but stones and and you just
[2:06:26] keep on digging
[2:06:29] i wish i could use a post-hole digger
[2:06:30] right now but every time you go
[2:06:33] you all know what a phd is
[2:06:36] it's not it's not education it's a post
[2:06:39] hole digger
[2:06:40] hey man
[2:06:41] you don't need no phd
[2:06:43] you need a post hole digger amen
[2:06:46] so so you get to digging and throwing
[2:06:48] out all them rocks you're throwing out
[2:06:49] the tin cans and you're throwing out old
[2:06:51] logs that would get in your way that
[2:06:53] would try to dam up the water that would
[2:06:55] come freely from the thrones of glory
[2:06:57] and just say get on out of here i'm
[2:06:59] gonna i'm gonna keep on digging because
[2:07:00] that's what elisha said for me to do and
[2:07:03] i'm gonna just keep on digging in the
[2:07:04] word and no matter who comes or what
[2:07:06] goes i'm gonna dig cause that's what he
[2:07:08] told me to do
[2:07:10] amen
[2:07:11] so we gotta dig in the word we gotta
[2:07:13] just come before him
[2:07:18] i love that don't you
[2:07:20] just
[2:07:22] just digging in the word until you can't

[2:07:55] after they dug the ditches
[2:07:57] the water that was dammed up in their
[2:07:59] life the water that was not flowing
[2:08:03] it flowed
[2:08:05] the wind the water and all came
[2:08:07] and the ditches was full
[2:08:09] so you dig those ditches to let the
[2:08:12] water come in
[2:08:15] let that water just flow through
[2:08:17] through you
[2:08:19] and you see the the moabite kings come
[2:08:23] out that morning
[2:08:24] rose up
[2:08:26] and said
[2:08:28] they've come up against us but we're
[2:08:30] going to win and they kind of looked
[2:08:31] over the valley
[2:08:32] and they looked they said
[2:08:36] well those those ditches they dug are
[2:08:38] full
[2:08:40] the ditches that brother
[2:08:42] jason had dug in the word
[2:08:45] it's full
[2:08:47] well the ones in the back said what
[2:08:49] what's it full of
[2:08:51] well the sun was rising up early that
[2:08:53] morning they said
[2:08:57] it's full of blood
[2:09:00] that's the king's that's king's blood
[2:09:03] our kings have fallen
[2:09:05] our kings have fallen that's our king's
[2:09:07] blood they have done dug so many ditches
[2:09:09] and they've done killed them all the
[2:09:12] the blood
[2:09:14] the blood has run through the ditches
[2:09:16] it's the blood
[2:09:21] it's the blood
[2:09:24] it shall pass
[2:09:27] what can wash away my sins
[2:09:30] nothing but the blood of jesus
[2:09:33] it's that blood this morning
[2:09:35] it's that blood that jesus shed on the
[2:09:37] cross
[2:09:39] and they were conquered right then and
[2:09:41] there due to them seeing that blood

[2:09:59] to get into the word
[2:10:01] i'm not expecting to be some theologian
[2:10:03] and be able to just speak beautifully

[2:10:08] amen and say i've dug the ditches now
[2:10:10] lord you just come and you overflow and
[2:10:13] you fill me up like you've never felt me
[2:10:15] before

[2:10:19] can be seen they're cast in the sea of
[2:10:22] god's forgetfulness that's good enough
[2:10:24] for me

[2:11:13] they crucified him
[2:11:15] and the male factors one on the right
[2:11:17] and one on the left
[2:11:19] and then jesus said
[2:11:21] father
[2:11:22] forgive them for they know not what they
[2:11:25] do
[2:11:27] and they parted the raiments and cast
[2:11:29] lots
[2:11:30] and the people

[2:11:48] if he be the christ
[2:11:49] of the chosen
[2:11:52] as he's
[2:11:53] he's there hanging on the cross
[2:11:56] forgiving them
[2:11:57] for all their sins
[2:11:59] forgive them for the not
[2:12:01] what they do
