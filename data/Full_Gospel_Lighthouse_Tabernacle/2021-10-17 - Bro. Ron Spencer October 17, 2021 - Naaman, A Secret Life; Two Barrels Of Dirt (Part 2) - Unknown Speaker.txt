sunday school type of deal there so so i'd give you something to look forward to also concerning the statements that we made about brother ron last evening i know that there were some that thought we were kind of referring to the meetings in the past we only reason we are saying those things is because the doctors have kind of clamped down on some things and so that has nothing to do with the meetings that brother ron has been in part of in the last month and two and so we're only doing that for the for our pastor and for his strength and that's what the doctors want to do is to see him regain his strength he's not just battling a a cold here but iran is taking the highest dose of chemotherapy and that you could possibly be taking and so we're just trying to get his strength regained to him and we will reevaluate all of those things and i i appreciate you as a congregation being so mindful of all of those things so brother brother william and brother mark will be taking the services next weekend and we want to be in prayer for those things i know that god has been lining up some things even for the brothers for this coming weekend and so we're just we're looking forward

hands [Music] hallelujah aren't you glad that love still stands yes [Music] good to see you amen he's good to us didn't he amen amen well i was really quite sick this week and and had some sort of a cold or something like that but god touched us yesterday and we were able to come to service last night what a powerful sermon that was preached here last night i hope you i hope you got a hold of that amen so good to be here to stand here with you this morning and we love you with all of our hearts why don't you just turn to your neighbor so listen to church amen amen we so love you we had wonderful meetings that brother had brother tim pruitt's there and then we had meetings that brother kelly held the branch just before that and uh amen so you heard that was a mandate going on my boys have to take care of me so and that was we had wonderful meetings but the doctors came home and said that's enough of that so amen so they are there they're doing their best to take care of me and and they they kind of whip me like my daddy did years ago so amen we certainly love you with all of our hearts and god is doing some incredible things if you will turn with me in your scriptures this morning maybe some of you watched the first service that i spoke at brother tim pruitt's and uh i want to speak part two of that here but i'll catch part one just for a few minutes and then go into part two i'd like to speak to you on naaman the secret life and part two of that two barrels of dirt amen and that second part is pretty important this morning so amen amen so maybe you that heard it before you know i preached a part of this a couple years ago and i thought well i've already preached on naaman year before but the lord dealt with me to speak it again this morning and i i then it just hit me well most of us can't remember what we had for breakfast yesterday so so we we won't mind a rerun and and brother daniel williams always said if you get it hot enough it'll be good even leftovers are good so i don't believe we've got leftovers this morning but we're we're just want to touch into the inspiration of what god wants to speak to us this morning in second kings chapter 5 in verse 1 one verse and then we'll go to luke chapter 4 and verse 23 now naaman the captain of the host of the king of syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the lord had given deliverance unto syria he was also a mighty man in valor i won't i don't mind telling you all of those words i wouldn't mind having said about me i i don't you know every one of us would be thrilled jumping through the roof if god allowed the writer to say that about me comma but he was a leper luke chapter 4 and verse 23. and he said unto them ye shall surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum do also in the country and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country but i tell you of truth that many widows were in israel in the days of elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the land but none of them was elias sent saved this seraphim in the city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow and many lepers were in israel in the time of elias the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving naaman the syrian jesus remembers even in that moment second kings chapter 5 and verse 15. now this is naaman and he returned unto the man of god and he and all of his company and said and he stood before him and he said behold now i know that there is no god in all the earth but in israel what a statement now therefore i pray thee take a blessing of thy servant but he said as the lord liveth before whom i stand i will receive none and he urged him to take it but he refused and naaman said shall there not then i pray thee be given to thy servant two mules of burden of earth for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offerings or sacrifices unto other gods but unto the lord you may be seated this morning may the lord bless the reading of his word so good to see you in the house of the lord good to have friends with us among us today and amen we certainly love you i don't know if you've looked at the trees god's getting ready to paint us a beautiful picture over the next three weeks so you enjoy that you're living in the prettiest part in the world don't take it for granted you're watching a season of life as it goes by and it's god does his incredible painting over the next few next few days and so enjoy that if you get a chance go up on the mountain big meadows some of you know that is a famous story but go up to big meadows and enjoy the leaves leaves god bless you brother jordan i love you with all my heart naaman this man was a a war hero this man was a liberator of syria this man was a fulfiller a prophecy of elijah this man would would would be responsible for taking even ahab's lives to fulfill the prophecy this man would uh would be an honorable man a very loyal man he would be a man that would set in king's councils and he would be a man that would be sitting in the inner circles of the most highest of the country he would be a man that's honored a man that is very looked up to a man that is has great social status as well as great honor all of us would love to have naaman in our family all of us would love to have him in our homes to have dinner all of us would like to be a part of his life to the outside it looks like naaman is a man that is has his whole act together life is perfect no doubt had an incredible home uh no doubt had a had a lot of people that work for him uh commanded when he commanded he commanded thousands and thousands of soldiers under him he answered only to the king he had a direct friendship with the king none of them knew naaman like the people in his house knew him because naaman lived a secret life whether we realize there are not many people that set in churches live secret lives especially in this age of computers and this age of of uh a media that we have it's easy to live a secret life on a phone or a computer or an ipad and uh and it is a curse to you naaman was a leper now to understand what leprosy was it was the most dreaded disease in israel or anywhere in the world to have leprosy meant that your fingers would rot off your arms would rot off your limbs would rot off your nose would rot off it started out to where that your skin would become become deteriorated and it was it was a it was actually almost like a cancer that was a flesh-eating disease and it stunk it was rotten to be a leopard and to declare be declared a leper you would be exiled because it was hugely it was believed to be you could be handed by touch or feel but but but leprosy would exile you from your community from your family definitely from your standing so when naaman becomes leprous it is believed that naaman became leprous because in the battle against israel he took a little girl and he brought her home as a slave girl some writers actually say that from the event of taking this girl as a slave and bringing her into his home caused leprosy to get on his body i don't know that i'm just just letting you know that but let me just let me just share this to you in his battles he would take treasures from the wars this day he took somebody that was more powerful than him a real believer and he brought her to his house now let me just say when naaman would walk through the door outside of the door everybody revered him everybody loved him everybody listened to every word he said but when he came home and he took his armor off and he started unwrapping because leprosy stinks and he has to be able to wrap it so to wear that it doesn't that people in the room doesn't smell the stink of his body so he has to live an extremely secretive life are you with me now are you with me it's just like sin it's just like sin it just infiltrates it's in in your life and many times it comes in innocently innocently it comes in and you just take on a spirit and then that spirit begins to lead you and then you have to hide it from your wife and you hide it from your family i'm preaching to somebody now you hide it from your neighborhood and they see you as somebody else that you project but that's not who you are you see naaman was a leopard but he projected himself as a war hero are you with me now so naaman was would come home and unwrap himself and and he would begin to wash himself and try to get the stink off of himself and every day there was a deterioration that was going on but naaman was though he be this powerful in the nation he was not the most powerful person in his home [Applause] outside of his home he was the most powerful but inside of his home there was a slave girl that believed the message of the hour that though she be an alien in another country this was not her home this was not her family this was not her community these were not her friends but though she be taken from her homeland believe in a prophet of the hour and she was captive now and taken to naaman's home believed to be taken care of extremely well no doubt this home was a better home than she lived in back home no doubt she was treated better nobody else she ate better but it did not change her belief system whatsoever this family worshiped idols this first this family worshiped false gods but this little girl still believed in the holy god of israel she still believed that elijah was the prophet of the hour amen now being more powerful than than naaman i'm saying that because as a slave girl she had power to deliver him whether you know this or not as believers of the message of the hour you carry a commission inside of you to be witnesses of the message of this day and it is deliverance over sin over every habit the blood of jesus christ has more power than every devil that's in hell this little girl she could she could honestly hate naaman have a grudge against him let me just say this the power of unforgiveness is a tremendous hindrance to a christian the power to not forgive the power to hold deliverance was something that she personally had to deal with [Music] because the quicker she die that he dies the quicker i'll be set free she could easily rationalize that one day she came to a point in the conversation till she actually spoke up to the to the master of the house and she said what the god that you would go to a prophet in in israel he could deliver you of that leprosy he could deliver you of that leprosy i want you to understand he couldn't go the doctor he couldn't go to a pharmacy he couldn't even go to a witch to try to help him out he could go to no one because now it would become news outside of his house but here is this slave girl telling him i can tell you were to be delivered now understand this no leper had ever been healed amen no leopard had ever been healed but this little girl had a revelation she had a revelation if you can give to the prophet the god of israel can heal you though none had ever been healed let me just say there's no case that is impossible to god now legion has to make a decision and in his decision he has to go to his king and he has to reveal to his king and find favor with the king i'm leprous let me just say this to you that's the first step for deliverance is confession amen that's the first step to real deliverance of your secret life i'm sorry i'm not taking enough time on that but living a secret life will only cause you to be a slave it'll only cause you to be a slave he has to confess to the king he has to get the permission from the king to write a letter to the king of israel to accept him to come to his country that he might see the prophet of israel listen when israel's king gets this letter he thinks it's a provocation of war this man is an enemy this man has led an incredible victory for syria and deliver them and now they're over here and there and now he wants to come and see our prophet this is a trick come on now i want you to just notice he packs up all of this incredible wealth and he brings his men with him and naaman wants to get delivered on his terms a lot of people want to serve god on their terms they want to serve him when it's convenient they want to live a half and half life amen are you with me now they don't want all the work they just want the portion that is convenient to them they want the blessings without the cost they want to be associated they want to be a spectator but they really don't want to put any spit in the game [Music] jesus said you've got to take up your cross and follow me first of all you must be born again there's no bypassing that people have incredible things that they have done in life and done a lot of things maybe for the cancer society libraries built at them after them buildings built schools built after them but let me just say this if you don't have jesus in your life you're facing the judgment and hell lays before you but you don't have to go that way [Music] a song that has said i i did it my way it's written it's written amongst even this in the last hundred years i did it my way elvis presley was one that made it popular other men sang it a lot of people live it my uncle had it played at his funeral i did it i did it my way it is a signature song for satanic worship you can't do it your way you can't serve god your way are you with me you can't do it your way oh you can but there's a cost to it well i'm only going to do it my way do it you'll only prove what's on the inside of you boy i love last night's service so what we do we begin to adopt things like this i'm only going to go so far so we adopt a so far religion there is a sin that my little buddy preaches the sin of refusing to go all the way amen sin to not go either way i want to be followers of jesus or followers of the message or associated with it or maybe just a spectator of it because there's benefits that goes along with that but really there's no reward if you don't go all the way the scripture said many run in the race but only him that finishes gets the prize i am determined in my life however long that god allows me to live at this juncture and i believe i can say this with power i don't want to hold back none i just went and preached the meeting and and people got coveted that was there i wrote brother tim because i understand that sometimes we as host pastors we hate to see people get sick we hate to see people come out of that after god has done some tremendous blessings and i wrote him a note and i said i want you to understand i knew the risk before i came amen i knew the risk before i came and i knew what the reward would be i am always willing to risk my own life to get the reward some of you may not like that but that's just how it is let's see lord i'll let that sit there just for a minute for you you see some of the reward of last week was deliverances come from a sermon like this people that had turned away from the message that had that actually spoke bad against it for years and now came back to jesus christ i would say the reward is greater than the risk and i wrote brother tim that not when i'm feeling healthy today but i wrote it when i was extremely sick this week and he was telling me how sorry that he was that i was sick and i wrote him and i said it was worth the risk well your amens is not as great as what they was but but if we lived in a day where that if you got caught in a message church and they are going to take your life would you still come we as americans get in our car we drive down the road most of us are driving down the road and something pretty comfortable we get in our car we drive down the road we get a little upset if it's too hot or too cold or we drive down the road we get out of our car we walk into the church we sit down in a pretty decent pretty decent seat there's no police or man that's going to come and arrest you for being a christian they're not going to haul you away to some labor camp for seven to 10 years we still live in america we're proving every day that we don't believe god in america anymore amen we did that behind by how we voted [Applause] we proved it we told god it's god you're ready we're ready the sodom conditions over so we voted and now look what we've got and i am neither way understand but in china they don't vote but when the message came to them they didn't ask us americans for money they produced the books for themselves and the churches and i preached in a very cold night setting in an open garden to about two to three hundred people sitting in very thick coats with policemen outside waiting outside and actually coming in and taking pictures now some of those men have spent much time in prison but there's no giving up i just received a letter from one the other day and he's admonishing his people don't give up this ain't no time to give up i may be incarcerated but i'm not giving up myself don't you give up now your trial is the opposite way so don't sit like you're out of danger your danger is laodicea and soft living your dangerous worldism creeping in and sabotaging you naaman was saying i want to do it my way like a lot of americans do i want to do it my way [Music] so finally he gets to get to come to elisha and elisha doesn't even come out to see you i imagine most of you would be mad i'm sorry this audi this congregation is in a kind of a different situation than those most congregations most congregations would be very upset if the pastor didn't come out and shake their hand and i hope you can give me some patience on that because of the almost two years of of of the highest form of chemotherapy they're telling me that i'm at a zero a zero uh immunity and so for me to be extremely careful so both places brother tim and brother kelly brother ray erickson's group was extremely careful with me getting me in and out of the meeting and you know i heard the rumors that i didn't shake their hands but you know it's just a stage in my life at least i'm still willing to come into public and preach to people so he comes to elisha and elisha doesn't even go out to see he sends gehasa out now no doubt naaman has been used to red carpet treatment he's been used to the finer things of the life and here is a servant coming out and telling him what the word of the lord is for him to do and the instruction is go washing jordan jordan is the nastiest stinkiest muddiest river that there is and very quickly naaman says well there's other bodies of water that is much cleaner that is much fresher that smells a whole lot better i'd be willing to go there and he gets extremely upset the scripture tells you that he gets upset almost refusing to go man of god didn't come out speak to me personally the man of god has sent his servant out here and now he wants me to go to a mighty stinking river brother branham said there was a there was a slave and this master would would would come down and be with him and he was always singing he was always happy he was always whistling and he asked him he said why are you so happy being a slave he said i've met the lord i've had an experience with the lord and he said i'd like to have that and he said well you got to go to the hog pin i ain't willing to go to that altar and cry and boohoo and repent for all my sins and pray through to god and you know everybody else look at me he said well that's what you got to do day after day this master would come to him wanting because if you ever get thirsty for jesus there ain't nothing else so satisfied and this this man came and he kept coming to him said i want to get what you got are you willing to go the hawkins are you willing to go the hog pin and one day he came and he was fully resolved i'm willing to do whatever it takes to get what you got come on let's live a life to where people will want what we've got people go around with a negative attitude all the time i don't know what they got sad all the time i don't want what they got imitations of christianity i don't know what they got i want the real thing we can have the real thing because it's at our disposal he came down he told the slave he said i'm willing to go to the hog pin today he said you don't have to go to the hog pin you just got to be willing naaman had some servants that told him said the man of god told you what to do oh yeah come on and reminded him you got to humble yourself yes sir i think that's one of the most powerful sermons that brother branham preaches brother orman neville had made a mix-up he thought had made a mix-up he invited another preacher to come preach and he also invited brother branham brother branham starts his sermon and brother neville quickly apologizes you can hear it it's all on tape you can hear it he said brother brother branham i'm so sorry i'm so sorry that i i've i've invited this other brother to preach i'm sorry brother brown is just as oh he's just as cordial as he can possibly be he said why sure we want to hear him this morning and this man got up it's not on tape what that man said but he got up and he preached about two hours well that man was a kingdom builder in the message he was anti-holy ghost moving he would cause much damage to the message through the years but brother branham came out up after him and spoke for about 20 minutes on the most powerful sermon called humble thyself it was the recipe for that man that spoke two hours just before brother branham gave him the recipe of what he really needed i'm preaching to you now a lot of people want to be well but they don't want to take the drug they don't want to take the prescription repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins count rosary beach does not take care of your sins getting a preacher to put his finger on your forehead does not take care of your sins [Applause] you gotta repent [Applause] [Music] naaman surrendered himself and humbled himself and went to jordan and there he dipped seven times can you imagine the word going around through the community of of israel all the leper colonies that there was the curse that was upon them and here comes a man from another country because a girl that was a believer in the message of the hour [Applause] that there's nothing impossible with god if this man would go take the recipe if he would just go take the inoculation i'm not talking about coving now but if you just go take the inoculation for sin it's way worse than leprosy let me tell you about sin sin will take you to hell god don't send you to hell sin sends you to hell send us a choice in your life amen jesus talks more about hell than he talks about heaven it's a real place you don't have to go [Applause] bless you bored i'm sorry on the seventh vip he came up and the secret that had ruled him all of these years is now god brother nathaniel we've had some very personal talks and i'm preaching down your past but it wasn't good today that the secret was gone wasn't glad in the day that you really knew that you knew that you knew that you knew that jesus lived in your life that day was the first day of the rest of your life and the secret of your past we're not here to rejoice or make that some great thing we're very sorrow and shameful that we live that kind of a life but jesus made the ultimate difference in our life getting ready to marry two kids both of them repented and been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen staying past that's gone and you don't have to live with that thing that i'll go back i'll go back i'll go back because if you truly get washed there ain't no going back and let me just say if you live in fear of going back you haven't went far enough [Music] [Applause] somebody help me preach now if you live in fear of going back you haven't went far enough hallelujah i never live a day of my life as of now i never live a day in my life in fear of this cancer because god's greater than the cancer but i never live in fear of my past because god washed my past away and it says though i never did it in the first place and there's nothing to go back to that ought to be your testimony there's nothing there's nothing there's nothing to go back to hey he comes back to elisha and he wants to give him reward and he's brought all these jewels and he wants to give elisha the man of god that no doubt has prayed the prayer and felt the leading to get him delivered i'll say some things right here he's wanting to give him all of his wealth for getting him in this state and elisha says i'm not about that that's right amen i i'm not about that how different that is than these charismatic televangelists [Music] that are all about money that are all about money let me just say this to you the kingdom of god is built on tithes and offerings you pay your tithes you be honest to god if you make 10 or 10 million dollars you just be honest it's between you and god but i'm not selling out for money i want this pulpit to always be an honest open pulpit to the message of the hour and stand pure and clean [Applause] we won't sell out for popularity we won't see a lot for women we won't sell out for money three kind of believers in every church you don't have to stay an unbeliever and you don't have to stay and make believe them but the most dangerous of any of it is to make believers amen he is someone that has took some steps of mercy and grace but he hasn't really got full yet he is one that brother adam talks about in the word to the church that will set amongst you for decades and then the enemy of hell will shoot him full of poison and he'll blow the church up i want to take it a little bit further than that he'll blow your family up he'll blow your community up he's a terrorist sitting in a church split to church with no remorse are you with me how did they get there they just took on a little spirit spirit in the spirit world they can see that you're feeding on darkness or feeding on light even satan knows what you're feeding on so be careful as christians of what you're feeding your soul on which dog that you're feeding that's the one that's winning the battle in your life and here was gahesa the one that delivered the message of deliverance that was a servant to elisha he watched elisha turn down turned down the wealth and the prosperity and naaman left naaman left and he followed him and he asked and actually gave references to what he was going to do with it as a lie that he was going to give it to servants and it would be good for them talents of silver and gold and and all kinds of different garments and he took it for himself and laid it on his servants his servants but remember the scripture go back and read it that when he got home he took that wealth from the servants and took it into his own tent i want to talk about two different things here and this is part two when he came back to elisha the man of god we have several different examples david was came to by the prophet nathan and nathan had been dealt with by god that david had a secret sin in his life and he told him about a man that had a lot of sheep right and that man went down to the man that had nothing but one ship sheep and he took that sheep away from him and david got so roth in that sermon and convicted he said that man must be put to death and nathan looks at him as a man of god that's why you gotta have a pastor you need a pastor that'll look you in the eyes and call out the secret things of your life amen let the word be the discerner of the heart and nathan told him thou art the man david repented immediately now let me just say this to you david had sowed the seeds of sin getting right with god didn't cancel the harvest amen you can't cheat on your wife and then expect her to trust you i'm not preaching to you because we don't have that problem here you can't cheat on her and then expect oh it's pretty good you saw the sins you were the filthy rotten dirty sinner that sold it and then because you got caught you want to make it all right it'll take decades to fix that thing but don't blame your neighbor don't blame you pastor don't blame your wife don't blame nobody else you are the man david the blood will never leave your house your children will repeat the process there was a man named aiken that went into a battle and he saw a lot of gold and in the battle he decided i'm not going to leave it i'm going to take it home with me the commandment was don't bring it home don't bring it home you know sometimes what you think of what god thinks is two different levels throw away what you think there you go amen amen throw away what you think well this is what i think about don't care i really don't care somebody walked in the office one time many years ago and it's been many years ago pointed their finger in my face and said this is what i think and i looked up at him and i said i could care less what you think there you go amen as a matter of fact i could care less what everybody in this building thinks and i can care less what i think i only want what god thinks i would like this audience of about 200 people to come to that conclusion this morning it's not what i think it's what god thinks and aiken took it and hid it in his tent he thought it was hid god knows everything god knows everything he's not fooled by nothing he knows everything he hid in his tent and it brought it brought the sowing of that brought a harvest of men dying at war and joshua immediately knew something's wrong here in the church i've heard sermons through the years sin in the camps sin in the camp i'm not preaching that now but here's what i'm preaching to you if there's something in your life get it out you get it out you don't need god to come and tell you you know what you've got going on in your life today is the first day of the rest of your life quit selling yourself excuses of why not to do it it's a good sermon right there some people are the best salesman in the world they're not selling shoes they're not selling shirts and clothes they're selling excuses and they sell it to themselves they sell it and then they buy they sell it then they bite and they buy the excuse of why not to go so far with god knowing that that secret sin is is a slavery over top of their lives and there's a crop coming well how do i get rid of the crop sow so many good seeds in your life until it'll choke out the bad ones you're welcome to say amen when it comes to elisha elisha knows what he's done he knows what he's doing what he refused gahesa has accepted there's a cost now there's a payday for this hazard doesn't realize that now i'm going to affect every generation of my children a little wine won't bother me brother ron what about your children a little pornography won't bother me but what about your children a little rock and roll don't bother a little country music don't bother all country music ain't bad brother run play it backwards you get your wife back your dog back your friends back hello [Music] don't you know that most of this country music started out in church and they sold their gift to the world amen they sow their gift to the world and so the gift laid there in their lives if they would have only done the right thing with it but they sold it to the world it will have a payday to it absolutely amen but they become popular they become gods in the world hey when your heart quits beating you know whether what side you want we all around here love pigeon forge well you got some honest here we really enjoy pigeon forge and we enjoy the things that are there the god of pigeon forges dolly parton she started out in church she attributes her uncle to being the preacher but she watched the ladies of the night and wanted to dress like those women so she took the gift of a little girl don't get mad at me now i wish i was preaching to her because she might get right with god [Applause] she projects herself as that little country girl coming from the church then going to the world and selling the music and that's an incredible amount of good things for children and for the community but she won't leave her bedroom without her wigs on and her clothes on and all of her makeup on because she doesn't want nobody to see the real hair hey she said it too many times in in an open thing so i'm just repeating what she said the world really don't know the real hair but she does and come today when her heart quits beating and she sold her soul to look like the women of the night and she's turned down jesus [Music] amen listen i'm only preaching these things they're not our heroes one time i was preaching away and i said dale earnhardt died at 200 miles an hour with his sign stuck out the window amen went right into the porters of the realms of darkness man came to me after church and called me a judgmental preacher and he was all over me and he showed me his dale heart earnhardt patches and i said i wouldn't let that be my hero i wouldn't let that be my hero he died like he lived can i preach to you i know i'm getting over time i know i'm getting over time don't let the enemy sabotage you and send something almost innocent into your life well brother i don't know what sabotage is shoot you do most every year you promise to go on a dot you get on your scale and it says one at a time please you look in the mirror and you know hollywood don't want no part of you there's not enough computer atomization to fix that body that you're living in good preaching folks where you're doing fine don't stop now so somebody sells you a diet somebody sells your diet sunset sunrise all lettuce all kale amen all fruit all rice hey listen i've been there done that i was on this diet called the cleveland clinic one time being on the cleveland clinic died it was real strict three days a week i drove and i was starting to lose some weight i was kind of kind of happy i was doing that and i drove and i preached for my dad that night and on the way back i stopped i stopped at a fuel station it was a sheets when i walked in to use the bathroom there was a heavenly sight in front of me krispy kreme hot [Music] sabotage come on connie called me and asked me said have you ate anything i had a coffee did you eat anything i had a coffee the next morning i'm working in the house and she comes in and she says how's the krispy kremes somebody had sent me an email that saw me at the filling station and saw me getting the donuts don't you worry the devil tell on you he will tell on you he will brother homer used to preach the sermon your sins will find you out how many remember that now krispy kreme is not a sin but it ain't good for you it's like the guy that prayed he said lord if it's your will for me to be at this krispy kreme shop let me find a parking place and he said i want to thank the lord that after the 13th round around the building i found a parking place [Applause] you know there's now nothing hazel can do he's standing before the prophet and the prophet knows he knows you can't undo what you have done you can't relive this morning much less yesterday help me preach see you was getting tight on me and i relaxed you a minute now i'm back at your heart's door he can't undo what he just did the freedom that naaman left with now is your curse leprosy was now on geheza and now notice the curse on your children's children family family family now lives with your choice come on i'm preaching to somebody probably on the internet poor sorry sinners let me just say this to you if you're caught up in a secret life get on your knees right now not to me to god get on your knees right now because the curse will come on your children and on your children's children it's only hurting me you're only kidding yourself you sold yourself a lie you're only kidding yourself you're cursing your children these people that walked out of this church in churches like ours and said brother brown was a false prophet didn't realize they wasn't doing doing that to their children they were doing it to their children and their children's children and their children's children [Applause] can you give five more minutes naaman knew he didn't want to go back to the life he used to live because the gods that he served couldn't heal him they couldn't change his habits they couldn't take care of the secret life scripturally perfectly points out that he was a worshiper of strange gods but now he knew and it was his confessions there's no real god in any of the earth except for in this land come on church let me just say this you it had to be a sobering thought to know that there's no real god anywhere in the world except for in this elijah anointing and i don't want to leave and go back to my country to what i used to be i got to have this i can't live without it i'm clean but i don't want to go back to worshiping false gods listen let me just drop this to you now there's many churches in the nominal system that had a real revival but ichabod is written on the door because they refuse this i'm sorry i'm far enough away from you i won't make you sick there's preachers in this valley that told their congregations to boycott the meetings with brother branham in 1958. i was walking with brother kelly hildebrandt and looking at the hotel many years ago a hotel that brother branham stayed at this time i actually stayed right across the road from that hotel in a smaller place nice place just across the road i gave a lot of thought of it i sit outside and and now you're going to get part of the next sermon that i preach here and i sit outside and i and i thought about the men that told their congregations in saskatoon whatever you do boycott this meeting that brother branham is coming to they had an auditorium that would seat thousands of people and 300 people showed up 300 people brother gunther who was the original pastor of brother kelly haldebrandt's church that led that church into the message was one of the men that went to that meeting and he did it under much pressure but he went anyway amen maybe you will have to do things under much pressure to come to this church or churches like ours you'll do it under much pressure but there's a reward for that look around at our families look around at the blessings look around at the children in this church look around at the women that are representatives of what this bible talks about as holy royal women look at the character of the men if you want to do some comparison studies look at the character of the men and the women and the children that listen model citizens no we're not a perfect group amen but let me just say this to you we we literally have a god amongst us with miracles and signs and wonders and blessings because he's here there's incredible benefits that goes with it i thought about what is going to be the cost for those men that stood in their pulpit and said whatever you do don't go to brother bran's meetings he's a false prophet they cursed those people how did they curse them they blinded them from the light can i can i just and they like to wash their hands of it now oh yeah we're sorry we're sorry we're sorry we're sorry there's another man that would like to have washed his hands and his name was pilate and he released unto them barabbas what a wonderful sermon the other day on i am barabbas amen pilate stood there and he didn't want the guilt of jesus on him so he said bring me a pail of water and he stood there and he dipped his hands and he washed it and he washed it and washed it but brother random said many times in the in the message he can't wash jesus off of your hands you can't wash jesus off of your hands and to just try to wash him off of your hands sabotages you i need an example elvis presley went to his death saying i i sow my soul you heard him saying amazing grace it'll give you chills have you heard him say how great they are it'll give you chills because he remembered the day when he walked in the presence of god and now he brings it to an open podium across audiences and it brings the presence of god down as a haunting reminder of you left me the hazel could never wash his sins off of his hands but nathan had a request now i finish naaman had a request i'd like two mules two barrels of dirt i love this part i like two barrels of dirt from here i'm just gonna put some words in it i'd like it from your yard because this is a place you stand in and the presence of god comes down and you worship a true and living god i'd like to have that dirt i can't live with you but i like to have the dirt i don't need jewels i don't need a letter i've been washed clean but i'd like to have the dirt i'm taking it back to my family hallelujah i'm taking it back to my home and i can see the caravan as it comes what did you bring back home as a trophy the last time you came on a great journey you brought the most powerful girl in our whole nation she brought you deliverance she brought you freedom today i brought home dirt dirt to where there's a living god that can be worshipped we're going to worship the living god that's for me and my house we will serve the living god hey if you just remain standing standing in musicians god i apologize to you for the frailty of my humanity i'm sorry i'm sorry i can't do a better job i apologize but i want to talk to you soberly now if there's secrecy in your life and you know it ain't right i'm no prophet i'm a gifted man but i'm no prophet you know that you know that you know there's certain little things you need to get rid of i don't want you to come to the altar now i want you to make it right right there where you are in the secrecy of this place you did the sinning you do the repenting not because you got caught because you're truly sorry i don't live that way look over at your children are you costing your children [Music] don't tell me who you are what your position is [Music] and he destroyed grandchildren because of his stupid bust so it don't matter if you're a war hero or you sit in the king's palace seeing the singing you got to deal with it not the preacher the preacher only brings the message [Music] maybe you've been worshiping false gods god's at rock and roll gods of laodicea and you've had a so far religion convenient religion i'm only going to go so far you made it up in your mind but this sermon has spoken to your heart [Music] why don't you be determined i'm gonna i'm gonna load me up two barrels of dirt this morning and i'm gonna truly get born again i want jesus to come into my life like never before whether you're sitting here or you're listening on the internet i want you to talk to god because you know where you're standing you know what your situation is heavenly father a god that knows all if he knows how many flies are on the earth and how many hairs there are ahead you know all about us you've offered us a blood a blood that we wasn't worthy of but you've offered us a blood to cancel out sin and give us an inoculation there's some steps that we got to make in our humanity willing to go to the home pen willing to be repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ or will we let sin reign over our lives for decades only to repent on the death bed where children will never see they'll never know the overcomer they just know that god gave the man or woman a chance to get right with god right before they died lord we thank you for those things but what about a life of an example of jesus christ [Music] thank god i'm not the judge today i'm only the mailman right now the minister to preach do i choose the rewards of riches or do i choose two barrels of dirt lord i want i want as for me in my house i want it to be a house where the angel of god is welcome to come where dreams can be dreamed and where visions can be seen where the presence of god can flow through the house where visitors will become convicted by the atmosphere that is there lord as for me in my house i want to serve the lord now lord the most important part of the many people's lives is in the next few minutes what will we do with this jesus call christ will we wash him off of our hands or we will surrender our life

away from you she sit there and talk to me about what a real christian was she said your atmosphere is a real christian standing that burst meal filling with gas i watched two elderly people stand and look watch me and i parked the car and they said there's a light about you did you know that i read i shook their hands and talked to them a little bit about the next 20 minutes i was able to just
