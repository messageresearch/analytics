going to sing for us this morning amen God bless you after you've given you can be seated I could just say briefly I'm trying to and I promise you I'm not going to do this every time Lord I just I can't help but testify briefly for something really special this week this is special to me as if God had healed me I went to dinner with an associate and actually it was the gentleman that was on the plane the one that brother Ron refers to as quite talkative he's a special special friend associate him and his wife and somehow another sitting there my wife just happened to for what reason I don't know mentioned that I go to church in Tennessee and then I go to church now I hear some and puzzlelook comes across my friend's wife's face and she's kind of like what's different you know it's four hours and uh they're they're precious people in the denominational world and I often say to the Lord Lord I'm not a minister I don't even want to begin to Broach that it's not my calling I'm not qualified but I remember brother Ron recently in the sermon it was a simple thing but it hit me in the heart and that's just living live it but that living it draws questions dropping four hours to go to service when I live in Raleigh Durham North Carolina and I just quick as she said that I just I I just felt that her prayers rushing God that prayer I pray so much talk for me say something say something because I don't know what to say and I actually looked at her and I just said you know well that that's a honestly I don't even know if I know how to answer you and then all of a sudden it happened it just happened and I referenced brother wrong I said I thought about the plane story I told it to my friend and last week when I stood back there at the back I said that Ministry there is so touched of God I said I prayed a prayer God that brother Ron would call me to the front and pray for my son and 30 seconds later he did that and I said we don't put man above anybody I said we've got a Ministry that we follow his name's brother Branham I said people followed Martin Luther followed this and and I just said two or three more things and she said I get it I get it I said we we we we don't have a memorized prayer we don't have this and you know I just wanted to follow my knees in front of the Lord right there and say thank you thank you that I was able to say something that didn't sound like I was trying to be anybody because I'm not I thank him for giving me the words well I've heard some people say how hard it is today to live and walk this good old gospel way well I know sometimes awake is rough you're pressing on please don't give up he's coming back again to take us home to stay oh and it will train this old cross for a crown foreign [Music] have those grounds and though sometimes awake is pressing on don't give up he's coming back again to take us home the state oh and Through The Valleys we may go we've got one with us we know the Lord you promised you'd be with us all the way [Music] and then we're gonna trade this old cross for a ground [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so we may cross [Music] [Applause] I gotta go through leaving my troubles behind oh I gotta one more battle with the devil that I know that he'll understand but I'm going through with Jesus Hallelujah only to his nail scarred hands I've been to hold it to his nail scarred hands well there's been a lot of people they're talking about me just to walk this narrow way it's just another Little Valley I came through it when I prayed well I've climbed a lot of mountains and I've crossed a lot of little stream seal Jordan cold and dark and that'll be the last for me that'll be the last for me well I gotta want more River to Cross I gotta go through I'm leaving my troubles behind well one more battle with the Devils then I know he'll understand hands [Music] [Applause] amen amen I used to we never got this thing in front of people but uh it's still kind of getting nervous but I'm just giving praise to the Lord [Music] foreign [Music] way to go we're temptation he whispered sweet peace to me oh he Whisperers [Music] to me [Applause] when I am casting my [Music] mind he whispered Burns [Applause] [Music] it is little small voice we know it's a voice that this spells all my fears and when I am cast down and I'm troubled in my it's right here that still small voice [Music] he whispers sweet peace [Music] [Applause] to me [Music] out in trouble in mind he whispers sweet peace to me when I care [Music] he whisperes to me amen [Applause] [Music] we heard this song the other night we ain't practiced it so forgive us but the girls and I thought it was so beautiful so whatever we do however we mess up just know that we're here to worship

just [Music] holy forever [Music] to the King of Kings [Music] foreign [Music] holy forever foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] to ask you for anything I just came to talk with you Lord you've answered a million prayers or more but I forgot to thank you for I just came to talk with you Lord maybe tomorrow there'll be trouble [Music] Sorrows [Music] may fall [Music] but until I face tomorrow's task I have no special favor to ask I just came to talk with you Lord how so many times Lord the troubles promise me down to my knees but I just came to talk with you Lord I have no selfish motive in mind I just wanna thank you Lord for all the times I just came to talk with you Lord maybe tomorrow there will be trouble and Sorrows [Music] may fall but until I face tomorrow's task I have known special favor to ask I just came to talk with you Lord I just can't talk with you Lord thank you [Applause] you know it's a it's amazing thing when you walk into the very mind of God and I know that you're not aware of what I'm speaking of as just now but I'm going to invite the choir to come but when you begin to step into the mind of God and you begin to recognize that you're in a vision Supernatural things can happen you can come choir but this song that the choir is going to sing today we had we'd plan this song out for brother Stephen to sing because this is this is Christmas this song right here embodies the very power of Christmas and I'd like to read this portion of scripture Revelations chapter 5. verse 7. and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof for thou was slain has redeemed us to God by the blood of every Kindred tongue people and Nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and beasts and the elders and a number of them was Ten Thousand Times Ten thousands and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven on the earth and under the Earth such are in the sea and all that in them heard I saying blessing honor glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne unto the lamb forever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever the choir song that you're about to hear [Music] a song that the kegleys came with their heart on their heart to sing Holy forever I believe we've stepped into a vision this weekend we didn't just come here for just to be here we come here with a purpose in mind and God sees everything and if the angels can keep singing a new song unto him and the elders can sing a new song and all those that are around the throne heard John say it blessings honor glory and worship be unto the Lamb of God I'll say we ought to be able to lift up our soul and lift up our voices under the god that is Holy forever what you're not what you're hearing is not a duplicate of a song what you're hearing is a worship to the lamb the lamb who is worthy of all of our praise we'll never get tired of worshiping him we'll never grow weary of worshiping him he is worthy of Our Praise he is Holy Holy forever God bless you foreign [Music] to sing the song of Ages to the land and all who've gone before us and all who will believe will sing the song of Ages to the land your name is the highest your name is the greatest your name stands above them all all Thrones and dominions all powers and positions your name stand s above them all and the angel s arise [Music] away holy forever [Music] if you've been forgiven and if you've been reading the song forever to the land [Music] if you walk in Freedom and if you bear his name sing a song forever to the land we'll sing the song Forever [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] stands above them all all Thrones [Music] position your name stands above all Jesus your name [Music] is your name [Music] [Music] Nation cry oh holy [Music] holy forever [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] holy holy forever [Applause] [Music]

wonderful amen it's good to accept me none of that today has been choreographed I like how God operates amen amen hallelujah it be good to us I want to read I want to read a quote to you I think you'll find very very wonderful I'm just like brother Neville I just can't wait till Christmas to open up that present and you know once in the once the man or once a man twice a child a child well I feel that same way don't you but I certainly think brother Neville looks nice in his new suit I got one of the prettiest overcoats that I've ever seen in my life from this church down here and I certainly appreciate it I thank you for judging me a little a little bit bigger than than what I really am but I believe that they'll get one just a little bit smaller tomorrow brother Brown was never over 150 pounds so it's just a little bit too big too much of a coat for a man it is to cover so you heard in the Bible where the blanket was too short for the men or the bed so so it's just about also that same way and here this is with me and the coat was just a little bit large but it's certainly pretty and I hope they can get me one there that's maybe just a number smaller and that will fit me real good and I'll wear it out to show like he did there he said I have seen the time where I have preached with the Overcoat on he said glad to have it on well I haven't had a good Overcoat all my life this is the first time I've ever owned a good Overcoat I don't like to be nerd about it I just wonder if this church can remember my first going away from the church and you remember what it was the night when I went down to St Louis from the church to visit brother Robert Doherty's daughter and brother and sister Spencer I guess you can remember brother Roy Slaughter is here many of them I didn't even have a coat at all and the church mate gave me a made up eleven dollars for my ticket and I barred my brother's Overcoat and it was just about twice too big for me and I packed it because it looked so bad for for me to wear it and and then I looked I looked bad not to have any at all so I packed it and when I got over there there was a couple of days and the Lord began to move and healed little Betty I think you'll like this part and you know I I seen her not long ago and she's a beautiful young woman now and she had Saint Vitus dance and just laying there like an animal jerking backwards and forwards for the days and days and the best of doctors had given up and I stayed that day in that evening and the Lord showed me a vision just on what to do and said little Betty would be delivered as soon as they did that and I told the minister and his father to stand and I said to the lady you was in the city the other day buying little pants and you bought one that's blue Granite pan and it's sitting in your cabinets down beneath you've not moved it since that you put it in there she said that's right go get it and fill it with water and bring that little white towel and come here for thus saith the Lord little Betty is getting ready to be healed amen a whole lot in that quote isn't it amen any good to us we certainly love him certainly enjoyed last night if you haven't heard it go back and listen to it the vision of Christmas and amen you got a little vision of what it was 2 000 years ago and you got a vision of what it's like in our home and amen and and we certainly we certainly are thankful for God and His blessings on our lives and we we drew trust that you have a very merry merry Christmas and so amen if that's kind of against your religion if you look that up brother Brahm said that about 400 times and so I think it'll work out real well Isaiah chapter 49 and verse 7. and then Isaiah 9 and 6. hey man thank you for your standing I'm I'll stand a little bit longer than what you have today but amen certainly appreciate your prayers for me over the last couple days have been a little bit rough and and uh I didn't leave last night I just went in the back and sat down for a bit and listened to the service certainly enjoyed the rubber being eaten off of some bicycle tires and so so sister Judy just in case you you notice that the Mennonites don't have any rubbers on their bicycles so you'll understand that Gabe's been eating the rubber off of those things and so amen I want to speak to you on Mary Mary two births Isaiah chapter 49 and verse 7. thus saith the Lord the Redeemer of Israel and His Holy One to whom man despiseth to him whom the nation at horeth to a servant of rulers King shall see and arise princes also shall worship because of the Lord that is faithful and the Holy One of Israel and he shall choose thee thus saith the Lord in an acceptable time have I heard thee and in the day of salvation have I helped thee and I will preserve thee and give thee for a covenant of the people to establish the Earth to cause to inherit the desolate heritages Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6 very familiar to us for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace you may be seated and we all say Amen Isaiah chapter 7 and verse 14. that sounds better therefore the Lord shall himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel I want you to just think just for a moment Isaiah is a prophet he's a seer he is the spokesman of God and when God speaks something it may be hundreds of years before it comes to pass when Isaiah speaks this to his audience and he writes it down no doubt science says it can never happen a virgin can never conceive and bear for sure a son and then you're saying that this son is going to be God I want to carry you to Matthew chapter 1. and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who is the Christ that's enough that's called Christ that's enough to just preach and Shout for a while now this is very familiar to us and verse 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise and when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph spoken for before they came together you as adults understand what we're saying she was found with child of the Holy Ghost not a third person in the godhead but God's spirit came down and began to speak to her and Joseph her husband be an adjust man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately you're talking about the strain of humanity you know Mary today has statues all over the world beautiful statues almost breathtaking statues all over the world but in that day she was a very disdained a lot of rumors was going around a lot of tail bearing was going around and if they could have they would have stoned her because they had scriptures to do it but there was also a prophecy that had circled the Earth for hundreds of years a virgin shall conceive Mary didn't do this of him of of herself she was elected of God chosen of God no more than you became bride of your own self you were elected of God and chosen of God you can't make yourself bride you have to be chosen and Mary was very much made fun of and listen she met an angel of God on a very busy Street nobody else saw the angel but Mary Dusty Little Road God ordained to meet her in a certain place Andrew spoken about it last night brother Branham speaks in Mary's belief might be good something to go listen to this week in Mary's belief brother Brown said they went to service and the rabbi took of the scripture of all of the scriptures that he took of and he put the scroll out and he read Isaiah Behold a virgin shall conceive and he said something pricked in their hearts something moved on the inside of him how many thousand times had that scripture been read but today the seed the womb was on the scene at the right time no doubt a lot of virgins and a lot of priests had looked at their daughters and said maybe she's the one but this girl that was not in the who's who that was not in a priest lineage but she came from the line of the tribe of Judah and God had chose her virgin womb to be born in not part Mary but God created his own germ seat his own life it was all God on the inside of her womb Mary began to to speak of her her her visitation it caused Joseph much trouble what will I do with it and Joseph had to have a visitation himself he had to have a visitation himself because now he would be connected with the testimony as long as you're miles away you know the testimony don't look too hard two thousand years later everybody can worship the baby at the manger but nobody wanted to have him born in their Church nobody no hospital wanted the baby born at their place it would cause much damage to their reputation but God had a Manger God had a Manger that was built with cattle and sheep and donkeys the Stars lined up Shepherds were moved and heard Angels Sing I heard a great denominational preacher preach a few years ago on the radio I just just happened to go across it and he said Angels never have sung I said I literally talked back to the radio and I said forgive me 2 000 years ago Angels sang they've been singing since the dawn of time holy holy holy holy holy if you listen close Angels sing in this building brother Chris and Sister Mary sent me something this week literally the recording of angels singing angels in a higher octave when nobody else was singing sing a verse it was beautiful I know how many times I've already played it I like to hear Angels Sing in this season they sank to Shepherds they didn't sing to Kings potentates great degrees of people rich people they went to people that would hear his voice his name Shall be Called Jesus no doubt there was a lot of jesuses in that day Jesus means Yahweh or Joshua Yahweh is salvation Jesus is the Greek form of Joshua that name the name of Jesus is the sum total of all Jehovah was in the Old Testament did you get that the name of Jesus is the sum total of all that Jehovah was in the Old Testament Jehovah in the Old Testament became Jesus in the new he did not come as a great priest or a great king he came to Earth as a baby no doubt Satan could watch God condensed sand and all the way down as he calmed and sinned it in Abraham and Noah in Moses in Joshua in David in Solomon and it was moving from one Prophet to another God was condescending through the Old Testament and no doubt Satan was watching when when God would come on the Earth prophecy had been told over and over and over and over and over again but God hid it from Lucifer how much has he hid you from Lucifer he would take your life if he could no doubt he whispers in your ear a lot of nonsense he would take you if he could he would take me if it could but God hid that seed of eternal life from the Devil there's a lot of religions in the world but there's one there's a bride on the earth that's worldwide not just in a little old group here but worldwide around the world that has saw the angel of God let us met the angel for themselves that Holy Ghost is a personal revelation to them persecution comes when you begin to testify that he lives in your heart when he lives in your manger Mary started get persecution when her robe began to fill out as long as it was just a testimony she's just a simple little girl talking about an angel's visitation she's not married and before long it's beginning to fill out she didn't produce that she was just carrying it you didn't produce the life you just said be it unto me according to Thy Word and you surrendered yourself to the word of God and it began to show on you it just began to show on you you didn't have to make yourself do anything you just ate you just ate and the word produces itself the word produces word the word produces life you come to church you say Amen to it and they for long your music change your desires change your closet changes things that you had all over you it changes pain on your nails it changes the hair changes men become men become men women become a ladies greens of homes and what you thought you had to paint yourself up to look attractive to the world was not attractive to our God and now you're you find out that you're more beautiful now with all of that hanging on you but now there's a character there's a character inside of you the Lord our creator the Lord the most high God the owner the Lord the master the Lord the Everlasting the Lord the provider the Lord the Healer the Lord the banner the Lord the miracle the Lord our sanctification the Lord our peace the Lord the judge the Lord of hosts the Lord our righteousness the Lord the shepherd the Lord the blesser the Lord the maker the Lord the Mighty the Lord the Jehovah the Lord the ever-present Luke 2 and verse 8. I won't get all of this preached this week but I I'll speak some next Saturday evening by the way we have one service next week it's next Saturday evening and they were in the same country as Shepherds abiding in the field watching over their flock by night and Lord the angel of the Lord Came Upon them in the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were so afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for under you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and there shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a Manger notice the Angels did not go get Kings and I have said it twice now he did not go get the dignitaries of society they went and got Shepherds that would be comfortable in a Manger but brother Ron's kings came but you haven't read the story kings came two years later they saw the star and they began to make a journey took two years brother Branham said they've been wrong in their doctrines all these years he said if it took those kings two years to get them and they brought they brought presence God anointed them to bring presents that would take care of the family gold frankincense and myrrh God arranged let me just say God is our provider and don't you never doubt God God is greater he's greater than your gift he's greater than your knowledge he's greater than your intelligence it's not you taking care of yourself no more it's God taking care of you he promised I'll be your provider I'll be your help I'll be your doctor I'll be your lawyer I'll be your provider I will take care of the wholesome total you may ring your hands and you may worry in your mind but God is God let him be God [Applause] get out of his way and just let him be God laughs foreign I'll be all right Satan knows it's the truth and he likes to fight the vessel and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherd said one to another let us now go even to Bethlehem of all the cities Bethlehem Bethlehem was the place that was founded by Ruth and Boaz what a story it was the bread place of the world the bread of life was going to be born there and God has to show literally forced Joseph to go there you talking about sometimes he has to force you into his will and it's not necessarily that he that you open the door but he opens the door and then he closes the one behind you and he gets behind you and he just kind of said push you and you go how did I get here brother Branham said that Joseph All the Way to Bethlehem first at a king he called him a brutal King that would cause him to have to go pay taxes sound familiar do you know that America had a tea party over 0.5 percent taxes and most of you pay anywhere from 30 to 51 percent taxes you talking about a tea party we ought to have one [Applause] I'm not going there once Angels come and sing to them they go more what wasn't that really nice wasn't that nice Angels Came saying to us but then they had a conversation we gotta go now when you got to go you gotta leave someplace and then leaving someplace you leave people behind they left their families and began to make a journey they didn't have a really good explanation because they were the one that met the angel maybe they were going along and stopped at a little Watering Hole and maybe they were just kind of talking with others and they said where are you guys going well we're going to Bethlehem what are you doing the gun Bethlehem you're not from Bethlehem well we're going there because Angels Came and sang to us really come here Bob did you hear this Angels Came and sang to these guys and they're telling us a virgin's going to conceive and they're going to find the baby not in the Cathedral of but in a in a barn nuts they're an occult the Angels saying to them God spoke to you he bypassed a lot of people [Music] he bypassed a lot of people and when you tell them they go that guy's a nut that guy's in a cart but they begin to make a journey and they didn't go to the biggest church and they didn't go to the biggest hospital they went to a barn because that's what the angel said and they found a virgin girl with a baby and Joseph was there to protect her and the baby was not wrapped in a in a blanket it was wrapped in swaddling clothes which is what the animals would be wrapped with when they worked and for us both phobia people that are phobia of germs God wrapped himself in a great wrapped gift he wrapped himself in the dirtiest clothes in the dirtiest blankets because he was going all the way back to Adam and he was paying for the sins in the garden and he was paying for every adultery and he was praying for every double marriage and he was paying for every murder he was paying for everything foreign [Applause] you can't find forgiveness for but our God can't Satan said I'll destroy the seed I'll destroy the seed the Kings heard about this King being born rumor or not they begin to kill every boy baby I can't hold it till next week Andrew s and millions of babies trying to kill the bride of Jesus Christ he's trying to do it in a womb before it ever gets here but God bypasses the wombs of your mom and daddy he takes care of you he watches over your seed [Applause] Hallelujah Paige I thought about how wonderful it is that you've been fighting for that little girl you've been fighting for her you've been fighting through court systems to get her and it's what has looked like impossible you've been fighting God put that in your heart to fight for that little girl go ahead and stand up right there got your lawyer he's your judge [Applause] Satan swore he take him away he swore he'd take your life he swore he would bury you in sin but God rich in Mercy I'm talking about a God that's rich in Mercy brother Jim when you can't forgive yourself for your past you got a god Jesus would be born and called illegitimate all of his life he would be called be elzy Bob he would be called a lot of things nobody in her day called her the mother of God nobody in her day called her the mother of God [Applause] but even meeting an angel she made mistakes she had Angel visitations and that didn't give her a new birth she testified that this baby that was born in her was God that didn't give her a new birth she diapered the baby she watched him fall and she held him she watched him scratch his hands and play in the mud and she held him she watched how he would operate differently than any other babies and she pondered the things in her heart she saw Kings come it didn't change her [Applause] at 12 years old they go as the custom wise to worship and somehow she goes off without Jesus brother on Mary didn't make any mistakes you're probably not going to like this part if you're Catholic you're not going to like this part Mary and Joseph went off without Jesus and brother bran said that's what happens in the church Jesus was in their church but they go off without Jesus Ichabod written over the door but they went off without Jesus they built Mighty big buildings and they got all kind of programs but Jesus is not there foreign they're gone for a few days I don't know how you can go listen I don't want to live without Jesus I'll share something with you last night I had a visitation I shared this with Gabe this morning you're going to like this and I saw myself at a clothing store and it was all suit jackets sister Connie will tell you if I like one I buy two if I like two I'll buy three and I go to this clothing store and I get 1100 Plus and the salesman says these all are the coats representing sermons that was preached by Elijah and the angel was standing and said try this on and I tried on deity of Jesus Christ and I said isn't it amazing it fits most of my coats have to be cut off both in sister Betty is one of my seamstress but most of them have to be cut off because they hang over my my arm and so they cut them off and and they hang too long and I look like I'm wearing my Granddaddy's coat and so they cut them off and I'm telling you this to tell you this I tried on 1100 coats Plus and he said where are you going to put them and I said I've got a place I'm going to hang them I'm going to hang them in the upper room of my house Hallelujah the prophet preached in them I want to wear that's what you'll hear in this church the coat fits and it fits perfectly and he told me last night it fits perfectly hang them in your house take one out and wear it I'm not done preaching folks I'm going to be here for a while if I got 1100 coach to wear I'm going to be here for a while [Music] I'm not ashamed of this message I'm at the angel I'm at the angel came into my heart and he lives he lives he lives foreign it was good this morning too wasn't it Gabriel comes every Sunday morning I'm sorry Sarah he comes every Sunday morning to our place it's home and he comes and eats with me breakfast and if you want to make a an appointment see Connie sorry that was more emotional that time than it was in the vision Jesus your father and I have been looking for you we've been looking and all of those preachers hurt her to deny the supernatural birth and Jesus has just confounded all those doctors and kings and scientists and told them about how that God created the body because he was there and he did it how did he created the Earth he just wasn't speaking off the cuff because he was there and he did it how the constellations of the heavens were laid out it was more than just off of the cuff because he was there and he did it Jesus talking about the one with the woman at the well look at that picture when he was talking at the woman at the well and he was talking to her before Jacob's Well I knew Jacob I knew Jacob I knew him well as a matter of fact he knew Abraham he knew Noah he knew David he knew Solomon and now he knows a woman at the well and if she could recognize the gift I didn't get an Overcoat but I got a picture brother Branham talks about this woman every service when I got this last night as a present it's going to be hung in this office back here because that same Jesus is in the building today maybe you're the woman at the well maybe you're the person that has come and he called you by name but you can't hide it from him and Jesus turns to her and quickly brother Branham uses his term the word always corrects the error and the word corrected Mary and brother Banner said if you will notice he never called her mother I preached that one time here and there was a couple that was visiting and they quickly went through their Bible he does never call her mother [Applause] he calls her woman even on the cross they asked him about his mother he said who is my mother and Mary was right there are you with me John Behold thy mother he was giving him instructions from the cross take care of her Joseph is no longer here to take care of her you take care of her come on Church come on church she wasn't God neither was she the mother of God I'm coming to a point here Mary had met an angel Mary had been corrected by the word Mary watch them beat him do you know how much tall that she fought as Humanity watching all of these events I dare say we must respect her we must always reverence her but she wasn't God I dare say we must respect brother Branham [Music] [Applause] we must honor him but he wasn't God [Applause] Jesus Is Our God brother Branham said if he wasn't God he was the greatest deceiver that the world ever had Hallelujah let's applaud that right there [Applause] she had stood in some very special places I would dare say that Sister Jenny I would dare say that one of the most difficult times the most difficult jobs the woman who changed his diaper that held him and looked at him as the word itself and she loved him all right today she has to help take him off the cross in those same hands now have huge holes and the brow that she's held at her heart she remembers when he was a baby foreign there was no lights there was no flashes of thunder that was ridicule outside the barn to have babies in the illegitimate child born in my barn and she held him today there's thorns on his head no doubt she tried to pull him out because they hurt so bad blood running from his side she holds him this is one of the most difficult days she's ever lived through Christmas should be worshiped but you've got to see the whole picture he didn't come just to be bored he come to be born in you and to be born in you he has to die like this he has to pay for your sins Reuben your grandfather introduced the message here at this audience and and here you are a grandchild even a great grandchild of that experience but you had to be born again you had to know this message for yourself not enough for you to raise your children in this church but they got to meet the same Christ for themselves you know he's preached I have power to lay my life down power to take it up again destroy this Temple and in three days I'll raise it up and it's been so powerful until King's order guards and pay them off to seal the tomb were these girls and men have taken him it wasn't enough to stand at every service and make fun of him but now after the crucifixion they guard his grave Satan will never leave you alone but I can tell you this if we go by the way of the Grave Satan can put guards at every one of our tombs on Resurrection morning we're going to come out of there [Applause] you're talking about a Christmas gift whether by cancer or whether by tuberculosis whether by old age or whether by an infant on that Resurrection Day God's going to unwrap that graveyard and you're going to step out of that grave [Music] I have power to lay my life down which meant you because you're in me I got power to lay you down and I got power to raise you back up again [Applause] foreign you're going to get a lot of gifts this week but none will be as powerful as that on the first day nothing moved that you could see but Jesus walked through hell foreign and he said my blood is not even dry on the cross but I've come down here to take over this wasn't what you could see those guards didn't see nothing going on but in hell he was unwrapping a Christmas gift [Applause] in hell he had some keys that he needed to get a hold of in a place called Abraham's bosom where some people that was trapped that met him with Abraham and Sarah they had met him West Ezekiel is the will of the middle of the wheel they had met him that's a temple that could be built God walked through hell and he knocked on Satan's door Satan said I thought I had you I thought I had you and he started when the prophets I thought I had you then and I thought I had you now and I thought I had you down but I got you on the cross and Jesus said shaken I've came down here to take all the [Applause] and when you're more powerful than every demon in hell you can take a halt and you could take a hold and you could take the keys of death Helen the grave he could not have did it if he wasn't more powerful than cancer he could have not did it if he wasn't more powerful than the grave but being he was more powerful because he was the word Eternal Emmanuel the provider give way [Applause] he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men you see Mary was about to have her next birth [Laughter] I'm not going to finish but Mary was about to get ready to get her next birth cause in the visitation of the Angel it didn't give her salvation her normal birth didn't give her salvation born of a certain lineage didn't give her salvation meeting an angel didn't give her salvation brother Branham said she climbed that ladder like the rest of the sisters she climbed up there with all those other people and hid away with 120 people and brother random said it if Mary and he even goes this far says Mary the Mother of God had to have the Holy Ghost so will you he said nothing will substitute it you've got to have the Holy Ghost in your life more than shaking a preacher's hand more than churchanity you've got to have the new birth I know people are so ashamed of speaking in tongues and Gifts in a church but Mary spoke in tongues she danced in the spirit [Applause] we got too many Church of Christ and Baptists that are dead we got too many dead churches too many dead preachers that are ashamed I want to explain away the Holy Ghost but I say unto you if Mary had to have it you're gonna have to have it why do I have to have a brother on it's a token sign to you we're going to be more than a church we're going to be a resurrection we're going to be a rapture [Applause] [Music] Give the Lord a great big hand today [Applause] if it takes my life I'll preach this message with all my heart I'll not retired like they've asked me to I'm going to give it more than I've ever had [Applause] whether you like it or not the greatest Christmas gift that we could get is him I don't know if you thought about it like this but Mary birth Jesus twice once from the womb of her body and then once from the womb of her heart I want people to see Jesus in me if they don't see Jesus it's because I have projected the wrong picture if you meet me that won't give you eternal life but if you meet the one in me and he lives in your heart you're talking about a Manger you're talking about a Manger won't you sing that [Music] I love you with all my heart I love you I love you with
