[43:03] a sea of the darkest age that there
[43:05] would ever be we're in a nation and in a
[43:08] world to where that identity has been so
[43:11] lost until motherhood is not the same as
[43:14] it used to be
[43:16] our our nation has come to the place to
[43:19] where that it's a two people working
[43:21] society and the the motherhood has been
[43:25] lost to where that moms can't stay with
[43:27] children and not going to preach that
[43:29] this morning but but we've lost as
[43:32] America as a world of what true
[43:34] motherhood is
[43:36] but thank God that we have had a message
[43:39] that restored
[43:42] our models and our relationships and

[44:31] Ella thank you for coming and being with
[44:33] us we so enjoyed watching you dance last
[44:35] night in the spirit and amen thank God
[44:38] that God has gave you a freedom that you
[44:39] can enjoy that and please take your our
[44:42] love home to your mom and dad one of my
[44:45] favorite preachers is preaching last
[44:46] night and today
[44:48] we became a great friends a long long
[44:50] time ago
[44:52] I would like for you this week if you
[44:54] could go back and at least listen to the
[44:56] last 20 minutes of last night's sermon
[45:01] I have to say that some of the most
[45:02] powerful preaching that I've publicly
[45:05] heard
[45:06] God's trying to tell you who you are
[45:10] and to get you to operate in that Faith
[45:14] to stand in the darkness of laodicea
[45:18] and you know you know sometimes as the
[45:20] week progresses and we get close to a
[45:22] meeting the devil will stir everything
[45:24] that he can stir up so that you will
[45:27] miss the point of what God's trying to
[45:30] do
[45:31] and and you know if you're not careful
[45:33] even you come into a service and you'll
[45:36] sit down and you'll and you'll go
[45:38] through the service and and the enemy
[45:40] will go through your mind and he'll take
[45:42] you in so many directions
[45:44] what he's trying to do is get you to
[45:46] miss what God's trying to tell you
[45:48] because this power power of the spoken
[45:51] word as it begins to deliver to you this
[45:55] is God is projecting through a minister
[45:57] this is what I see you as
[46:01] you may not look at yourself as that but
[46:05] this is the way God is looking at you
[46:09] Abraham you're a father of many nations
[46:13] yet childless
[46:15] I see you as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[46:18] walking on streets of gold
[46:22] spending eternity together in a realm to
[46:25] where there's no time where's no
[46:27] troubles there's no situations and if
[46:30] you can just get to the point to where
[46:32] you believe that you're going to walk
[46:33] there
[46:35] there's not a devil in hell could shake
[46:37] you from that
[46:39] are you with me today
[46:48] I thank brother Wayne for coming and
[46:51] being away from his home and his family

[46:58] them I I'd like to just say thank you
[47:00] brother Wayne for coming and and uh I
[47:03] want you to grab a halt of what God

[47:22] to where that you can speak to me this
[47:24] morning

[47:40] a hold of what God is saying you know we
[47:43] could preach every weekend but I want I

[1:00:36] Lord with you and amen want to say happy
[1:00:38] Mother's Day to you all and amen it's a
[1:00:42] it's a great honor a man to be here at
[1:00:45] Full Gospel Lighthouse and with our
[1:00:48] buddy Ron and brother Andrew Matt and
[1:00:51] all the ministering Brothers God bless
[1:00:53] you all and certainly been a tremendous
[1:00:56] blessing in our life to be considered a
[1:00:59] friend with brother Ron and and uh and
[1:01:02] to know him as a friend and we thank God
[1:01:04] for it you know true friendships are not
[1:01:07] bought and but they're actually a gift
[1:01:10] that God gives you and in preciousness
[1:01:14] amen and those gifts and we thank the
[1:01:16] Lord for them and sometimes you know you
[1:01:19] know how it is it just you know a lot of
[1:01:21] people but some people you just become
[1:01:22] special friends with and and we thank
[1:01:25] the Lord for those kinds of people
[1:01:26] that's uh in life and we just want to
[1:01:29] say it's a real honor to be with you and
[1:01:31] we want to bring you greetings to all
[1:01:33] and amen I'm just thinking about
[1:01:36] the loveliness of this day and amen I
[1:01:39] know we call it Mother's Day amen but
[1:01:41] how could one day represent such a
[1:01:43] wonderful thing as mother
[1:01:45] you know how could how could you put
[1:01:47] that in one day or one few words there's
[1:01:50] nothing greater than a mother amen
[1:01:53] nobody nobody loves you I probably
[1:01:55] probably don't know I should say this
[1:01:57] out loud but the other day we was having
[1:01:59] dinner with some brothers and brother
[1:02:00] Ron was there was down at brother Sean's
[1:02:01] meetings and and they were talking
[1:02:03] somebody said something about me
[1:02:04] preaching I said well I got brother Ron
[1:02:07] here tonight somebody's going to enjoy
[1:02:08] it you know and they kind of laughed at
[1:02:11] me and I said now as long as I got
[1:02:13] brother Ron and my mom and
[1:02:15] they just don't see no wrong in me and I
[1:02:19] don't
[1:02:20] I don't I don't know how we did it but
[1:02:22] we thank God for it amen he could hear
[1:02:24] me preach when I feel like I flubbed it
[1:02:26] he'll say oh that was tremendous
[1:02:28] so thank you brother
[1:02:31] encouragement amen I want to thank you
[1:02:34] one appreciate those that are traveling
[1:02:35] with us this weekend and we want to go
[1:02:37] into the word of the Lord in the book of
[1:02:39] Philippians
[1:02:40] the third chapter the 20th verse amen I
[1:02:47] I believe that this is a
[1:02:49] a season that is a special time for the
[1:02:53] church
[1:02:54] some things
[1:02:57] I believe that are so significant to us
[1:03:00] that the enemy would like us to lose our
[1:03:03] focus upon it
[1:03:04] or somehow get our mind on something
[1:03:06] else but I pray God help us to keep our
[1:03:09] minds and our Focus
[1:03:11] on the Promises
[1:03:12] that have been given to us
[1:03:14] Amen in Philippians chapter 3
[1:03:17] and the 20th verse I want to read this
[1:03:20] couple verses 20 and 21 then we could be
[1:03:23] seated
[1:03:24] now for our conversation isn't heaven
[1:03:27] from whence also we look for the Savior
[1:03:30] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:33] who shall change our vile body
[1:03:37] that it may be fashioned
[1:03:39] like it unto his own glorious body
[1:03:42] according to the working whereby
[1:03:45] he is able to subdue all things
[1:03:49] unto himself
[1:03:51] he is able to subdue all things unto
[1:03:54] himself amen let's just power hearts
[1:03:57] Heavenly Father we thank you this
[1:03:59] morning
[1:04:00] for the spirit and the grace that you
[1:04:01] put in our lives
[1:04:03] now Lord Jesus
[1:04:05] we're asking you
[1:04:07] that you would just come this morning
[1:04:08] with Liberty
[1:04:10] and father is this wonderful
[1:04:11] congregation have gathered together
[1:04:13] today on this Mother's Day I I pray that
[1:04:16] you would bless them Lord
[1:04:18] that you would give Grace to their their
[1:04:20] hearts and their lives and that you
[1:04:22] would strengthen each one of them Lord
[1:04:24] now father as we Endeavor to speak your
[1:04:26] word I pray that Lord that you would
[1:04:28] bring your mercy bring your grace Upon
[1:04:31] Our Lives and use this Lord For Your
[1:04:33] Glory
[1:04:34] before this people Lord before anyone
[1:04:37] who would ever hear this we acknowledge
[1:04:39] we have no abilities and there's nothing
[1:04:42] good that we have to offer
[1:04:44] but Lord Jesus if there would be
[1:04:46] something done we give you all the glory
[1:04:49] and the honor and praise unto you that
[1:04:51] you are the matchless Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:54] and we thank you Father as we invite you
[1:04:57] to come now take the platform Lord and
[1:05:00] use it for your glory we pray in Jesus
[1:05:02] name amen
[1:05:04] and amen and God bless you as you can be
[1:05:07] seated today amen I want to speak to you
[1:05:10] just a little bit uh today on this
[1:05:13] Mother's Day and I want to title this
[1:05:15] the blending of Dimensions the blending
[1:05:18] of Dimensions uh it's a rather odd
[1:05:21] sermon for a Mother's Day and I woke up
[1:05:24] struggling with it this morning and and
[1:05:26] so I turned on Mother's Day tape about
[1:05:28] six o'clock this morning and brother
[1:05:30] Bram said my text today is a rather odd
[1:05:33] text for Mother's Day and he spoke on
[1:05:36] the resurrection and I thought isn't
[1:05:37] that something because that's that's a
[1:05:39] real Mother's Day right amen that's when
[1:05:41] the real Mother's Day happens is when
[1:05:43] the resurrection takes place and amen
[1:05:45] and brother Bram spoke upon it and and I
[1:05:48] was sitting there and I was praying
[1:05:49] saying Lord maybe maybe there's
[1:05:51] something that you would have me to
[1:05:52] speak something different and and I got
[1:05:54] to recollect in a conversation we had
[1:05:56] yesterday with with Ron there at the
[1:05:58] table and he was talking about how that
[1:06:00] when Jesus was out on the sea and he
[1:06:03] said something came to them and that
[1:06:05] what they had need of to get through the
[1:06:07] storm was already on the boat you know
[1:06:09] and I got to thinking about that that
[1:06:11] you know what you really have God's
[1:06:13] already give you amen and I think
[1:06:15] sometimes if we're not careful we forget
[1:06:17] how much God has gave us and what the
[1:06:20] value is of that that has been given
[1:06:22] amen I I certainly believe that you're
[1:06:25] in possession of more than you actually
[1:06:27] realized this morning and knowing that
[1:06:30] when God Reveals His secrets that those
[1:06:32] things belong to the church and and the
[1:06:35] possession that you have and what you're
[1:06:37] in possession of is much greater than
[1:06:40] that you would be able to maybe realize
[1:06:42] amen but I want to just take this today
[1:06:45] for a little bit and speak upon it and
[1:06:47] maybe just uh speaking through the
[1:06:49] scripture here just for a few moments
[1:06:51] amen but the scripture tells us amen
[1:06:54] that there would be a change that would
[1:06:56] come upon the church now I I certainly
[1:06:59] believe that this is the generation uh
[1:07:02] that is the generation of rapture now I
[1:07:05] believe that we've had the prophet of
[1:07:07] rapture and I believe we've had the
[1:07:09] child the sound out in the message and
[1:07:12] we've got the voice living among us so I
[1:07:14] I really believe that this is the
[1:07:17] generation that will see the Rapture now
[1:07:19] I I know that this might sound a little
[1:07:22] bit fanatical to some people but I
[1:07:25] really believe that there's people
[1:07:26] sitting in this building that will
[1:07:28] change their bodies amen I believe this
[1:07:31] I believe that it could be this morning
[1:07:34] I believe that this afternoon I believe
[1:07:37] in the morning someone could wake up and
[1:07:39] things be different because I believe
[1:07:41] we're serving a god of promise and the
[1:07:45] promise of this age is that God would
[1:07:47] change our bodies I just love that that
[1:07:50] there would come a change now in First
[1:07:52] Corinthians 15 the Bible said this I say
[1:07:55] Brethren that the flesh and blood cannot
[1:07:57] inherit the kingdom of God and neither
[1:08:00] doeth corruption inherit incorruption
[1:08:02] but I will show you a mystery we will
[1:08:05] not all sleep but we shall all be
[1:08:07] changed now whether they're living or
[1:08:10] whether they're sleeping there's
[1:08:12] everybody's got to be changed
[1:08:14] everybody has to be changed do you know
[1:08:17] that the very same thing changes
[1:08:19] everybody whether someone has passed
[1:08:21] away and they're sleeping in the dust or
[1:08:23] whether they're alive the same thing
[1:08:25] changes both people and that is the Lord
[1:08:29] himself that's the only way that we can
[1:08:32] promise change to any life is through
[1:08:34] the Lord Jesus Christ without change
[1:08:36] without Christ there is no change
[1:08:39] there's no change in you there's no
[1:08:41] change in situations there's no change
[1:08:43] in life but with him there can be change
[1:08:46] so when we see that this corruptable
[1:08:49] shall have put on incorruption and this
[1:08:51] Mortal shall put on immortality then
[1:08:54] shall be brought to pass the saying that
[1:08:56] is written death is swallowed up in
[1:08:59] Victory and oh death where is thy sting
[1:09:02] and oh grave where is thy Victory now
[1:09:04] this was coming from a man that was had
[1:09:06] his head on The Chopping Block amen if
[1:09:09] if anybody was looking in the face of it
[1:09:11] he was looking in the face of death and
[1:09:13] he was literally mocked talking there
[1:09:15] saying to them where is your victory
[1:09:18] over me and he was telling that you have
[1:09:21] no Victory because it has been given to
[1:09:23] me through our Lord Jesus Christ he was
[1:09:26] saying to this where is thy sting and
[1:09:28] where is thy victory in other words what
[1:09:30] can you do to me when our lord Jesus is
[1:09:33] already went into the tomb and come back
[1:09:35] again and he's conquered death hell and
[1:09:38] the grave and I am a believer now of
[1:09:40] course we realize that this thought amen
[1:09:43] that the grave would lose its victory in
[1:09:45] Job chapter 14 this is where that job
[1:09:48] himself talks about change and he says
[1:09:51] if a man shall die shall he live again
[1:09:53] now all the days of my appointed time
[1:09:56] will I wait until my change come isn't
[1:10:00] it something that this this is
[1:10:02] appropriate as change and job knew that
[1:10:05] he would go into the ground but he said
[1:10:07] this he says now thou shall call and I
[1:10:10] will answer thee and thou will have a
[1:10:12] desire to work of thine hands that thou
[1:10:15] will call and I will answer thee now it
[1:10:18] might be a thought of someone this
[1:10:19] morning to say you know well job Shirley
[1:10:22] said you put me in the ground and I'll
[1:10:23] come again as if he didn't know what
[1:10:26] happened to a body that went in the
[1:10:28] ground but this man knew what would take
[1:10:31] place he actually knew how the grave
[1:10:34] would consume a human body he said for I
[1:10:36] know that my redeemer liveth and that he
[1:10:39] shall stand at the latter day upon the
[1:10:41] Earth and though after my skin worms
[1:10:44] destroy the body yet in my flesh shall I
[1:10:47] see God whom I shall see for myself and
[1:10:50] mine eyes Shall Behold and not another
[1:10:52] though my Reigns be consumed within me
[1:10:55] now this man knew amen that the very
[1:10:58] thing that was in his body was going to
[1:11:01] destroy it but the God that he was
[1:11:03] serving he had already seen the
[1:11:05] resurrection in its power and knew that
[1:11:08] God could raise him up again how many
[1:11:09] realizes that this was not in Prophecy
[1:11:12] until job spoke this in job 19th Chapter
[1:11:15] so job was speaking his own Resurrection
[1:11:19] he was already prophesying that he was
[1:11:21] going to come out of the grave and he
[1:11:24] was putting it in resurrection power he
[1:11:26] was telling them that when God called he
[1:11:29] was going to answer in Job 14 and verse
[1:11:31] 15 the Bible says amen of course amen
[1:11:35] that he would call and he would answer
[1:11:36] now if you if you break into it a little
[1:11:39] bit it says this that my dissolved frame
[1:11:42] shall be United at thy call and the body
[1:11:45] and soul shall be rejoined together in
[1:11:47] other words job knew that however long
[1:11:50] it took God to raise him from the grave
[1:11:53] he knew that God would be able to put
[1:11:56] stuff back together again just at his
[1:11:59] call that just because God said come
[1:12:01] forth he knew that they could not do
[1:12:04] anything to him that God could not call
[1:12:07] him out of the Bible says amen that he
[1:12:10] would be called and there would come an
[1:12:12] answer now in restoration Laboratory
[1:12:14] other animals say this he said though
[1:12:16] the skin worms destroy my body yet in my
[1:12:19] flesh shall I see God now regardless of
[1:12:22] how little we are or how low we are or
[1:12:25] how impure we are or how Unholy we are
[1:12:28] or how sick we are or how Afflicted we
[1:12:31] are the law of God's spirit by his word
[1:12:34] makes it obey him and it forces the
[1:12:38] issue it says give it back now now
[1:12:41] brother Graham said now it forces it
[1:12:43] regardless of conditions no matter what
[1:12:46] the condition is the law of God's word
[1:12:49] forces a condition to cope with his word
[1:12:53] now the prophet is instilling an idea
[1:12:56] that whenever you have a word upon
[1:12:59] something it really doesn't matter
[1:13:01] whatever it is that the enemy says that
[1:13:03] this condition is too great that it
[1:13:05] cannot change here is a prophet saying
[1:13:08] regardless of the conditions amen God's
[1:13:12] word has the power to change the
[1:13:15] condition now that's the that's the
[1:13:16] reality is that job knew that the word
[1:13:20] of God stood for that resurrection power
[1:13:23] that was to come upon him and he no
[1:13:25] matter what condition he was in when the
[1:13:28] resurrection came he would have to call
[1:13:30] now the prophet of God says see what it
[1:13:33] is it'll be a roll call in heaven he
[1:13:35] said now if a man shall die shall he
[1:13:37] live again this is this is job now all
[1:13:39] the days of my appointed time will I
[1:13:41] wait till my change come and thou shall
[1:13:43] call and I will answer thee and thou
[1:13:45] shall have a desire to work thy hands
[1:13:48] the great Shepherd is calling his Sheep
[1:13:51] by name the creative voice of God is
[1:13:55] calling them from the dust or changing
[1:13:57] their atoms even if they had not fell
[1:14:00] asleep it is the rapture amen it is the
[1:14:04] marriage supper of the Lamb it's a roll
[1:14:06] call in heaven the creative a voice of
[1:14:10] God is going to call them from the dust
[1:14:12] now now that job is absolutely going
[1:14:15] into the dust but when Christ came he
[1:14:18] was going to call him out of the dust in
[1:14:20] a great Resurrection when when
[1:14:22] Melchizedek come to Abraham I think it's
[1:14:25] a beautiful story but when Melchizedek
[1:14:27] came to Abraham what did he bring to
[1:14:30] Abraham he brought him a message of
[1:14:32] change
[1:14:34] now his body said there could be no
[1:14:37] change to take one look at Abraham and
[1:14:40] Sarah in that condition they would have
[1:14:42] said this man speaks like a fool to tell
[1:14:45] us we're going to have a child in the
[1:14:47] old age but the one that was speaking to
[1:14:50] him had already been in the future of
[1:14:52] Abraham and he was calling a man who had
[1:14:55] no seed a father knowing that the one
[1:14:58] that was speaking had the power to
[1:15:01] change the circumstances that Abraham
[1:15:03] was in that he was going to change his
[1:15:05] body now I think it's a powerful thing
[1:15:08] this morning to realize that the god
[1:15:10] that we're serving amen he could not
[1:15:12] fail Our God cannot fail and neither can
[1:15:15] our God lie now he can do anything but
[1:15:19] God can't lie so when God said you'll
[1:15:22] have a son Our God could change
[1:15:25] Abraham's body but he couldn't lie to
[1:15:27] Abraham he told Moses to deliver these
[1:15:30] children and take them in a lamb and God
[1:15:33] could open a red sea and God confused
[1:15:36] two million people and God could bless
[1:15:38] them in their desert Journey but God
[1:15:41] couldn't lie amen and I don't know what
[1:15:43] circumstances you you are in this
[1:15:45] morning but let me say this to you it
[1:15:48] does not matter how low it doesn't
[1:15:50] matter how troubled it doesn't matter
[1:15:52] the condition of your life we are
[1:15:55] serving a God that has the ability to
[1:15:58] change the condition to come into the
[1:16:00] power of his promise I believe today
[1:16:02] that there's a God Amen who can coat
[1:16:05] things to make it what did he decide
[1:16:07] it's going to be
[1:16:09] amen roll call in heaven now of course
[1:16:12] when Melchizedek thank you when
[1:16:14] Melchizedek came unto Abraham he
[1:16:16] prophesied of his body change and
[1:16:19] Abraham was changed to fit the very
[1:16:22] confession that God made over his life
[1:16:25] now that that was a body change in the
[1:16:28] days of Abraham it was a resurrection in
[1:16:31] the days when Melchizedek came and
[1:16:34] became Jesus Christ but when Melchizedek
[1:16:37] returns in the end time it will not be
[1:16:40] just a body change but it will be a body
[1:16:43] change and a resurrection the creative
[1:16:46] voice of God that is speaking over this
[1:16:50] bride amen will have the power to change
[1:16:53] you in your elements or raise you from
[1:16:56] the great whichever it finds you in it
[1:16:59] has the power of change it has the power
[1:17:02] to replace this body now of course this
[1:17:06] change we're talking about is a change
[1:17:07] of garments brother random taught us
[1:17:10] from the book of Corinthians that Paul
[1:17:12] said if we know this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:17:14] be dissolved we have a bill in a house
[1:17:16] not made with hands and it's Eternal in
[1:17:18] the heavens for we groan he earnestly
[1:17:22] Desiring to be clothed upon with a house
[1:17:24] which is from Heaven it's amazing how
[1:17:27] the scripture sounds so funny doesn't it
[1:17:29] that we're going to wear a house
[1:17:32] you ever think about that we're going to
[1:17:33] wear a house amen we're going to it's
[1:17:36] not a house amen it's a body we're not
[1:17:39] we're not trying to wear a house we're
[1:17:41] not going to change houses we're going
[1:17:43] to change bodies amen and Paul is saying
[1:17:47] this amen that this Earthly house or
[1:17:49] it's a tabernacle or other people call
[1:17:52] it a mansion amen and the prophet of God
[1:17:55] said no it's a body it's a red-headed
[1:17:57] and blonde-headed and black-headed amen
[1:17:59] their bodies is what they're talking
[1:18:01] about amen and the scripture is plain to
[1:18:03] say that if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:18:06] dissolved we have one waiting in the
[1:18:09] eternals and it's already there amen it
[1:18:12] is an eternal body that you move into if
[1:18:15] you move out of this place God's got a
[1:18:18] place for you to move into amen let me
[1:18:20] just say it like this we are never going
[1:18:21] to be homeless as the son or daughter of
[1:18:24] God we're not going to be homeless your
[1:18:26] mothers that are in the grave this
[1:18:27] morning are not homeless God only move
[1:18:30] them out of that old body and put them
[1:18:32] in a brand new body amen I tell you the
[1:18:35] first time I met brother Ron amen I met
[1:18:37] him talked to him a few minutes and I
[1:18:38] knew his dad already and met his mama
[1:18:40] amen and when I met him I said oh I
[1:18:42] actually do knew his dad well I met his
[1:18:45] mama I said oh there's where Ron came
[1:18:47] from amen I I saw that character coming
[1:18:50] right right through so you know this
[1:18:52] morning amen sister Spencer amen she
[1:18:55] she's in another body right and that
[1:18:58] body is a young body how many knows

[1:19:02] about 22 years old amen that's why
[1:19:05] naturally the world is trying to go back
[1:19:08] to that body is that right that's why
[1:19:10] everybody's trying to be 20 again trying
[1:19:12] to be 22 again trying to be 25 again and
[1:19:15] when they can't do it they're surgically
[1:19:17] doing it right
[1:19:19] amen they got surgery for everything now
[1:19:21] it's Amen I better be careful but I I'll
[1:19:25] just say this amen be careful who you
[1:19:27] remodel they might leave you

[1:19:37] old an old he
[1:19:40] remodeled a old lady and when she got

[1:19:52] to go find some other old boy listen you

[1:19:57] reason your rear view mirror is smaller
[1:19:59] than your windshield you are not

[1:20:04] rear view mirror you cannot Look

[1:20:26] view mirror and try to go back there and
[1:20:29] either brother do we need to try to look
[1:20:31] in that rearview mirror because you

[1:20:34] again I promise you you're never going
[1:20:37] to look like that again you can do what
[1:20:39] you want to amen but you know when
[1:20:40] they're 20 years old amen all they got
[1:20:42] to do is eat a little food and they got
[1:20:44] muscles on their ears

[1:20:50] while

[1:20:56] years old man's trying to get back there
[1:20:58] and they're never going to get back
[1:21:01] through intellectuals and they're never
[1:21:03] going to get back through science and
[1:21:06] they're never going to get back through
[1:21:07] medications amen but God gave us away
[1:21:10] amen that we could get back to that body
[1:21:13] listen I don't know amen if you'll have
[1:21:16] to bypass the grave or you're going to
[1:21:18] go through the grave but one thing I

[1:22:03] a different part of Heaven you better
[1:22:04] ask for a different part of Heaven amen
[1:22:07] because the part I live in is going to
[1:22:09] be dancing every morning and dancing
[1:22:11] every evening
[1:22:13] somebody said well you got that new kind
[1:22:15] of religion no sir I got the oldest kind
[1:22:18] of religion there is it's called
[1:22:20] shouting religion and I think it's time
[1:22:22] that we shout out some of the formal
[1:22:25] Devils amen that is raised up in this
[1:22:27] age like a bunch of Philistines trying
[1:22:29] to take the blessings of God away from
[1:22:31] the church well this is one preacher
[1:22:33] that's not going to shut up and sit down
[1:22:36] amen I think we ought to put our voice
[1:22:38] [Applause]
[1:22:41] yes sir amen I believe it don't you I
[1:22:46] believe in the grace of God this morning
[1:22:47] I I believe that Paul said we'll be
[1:22:49] clothed
[1:22:51] with a house not a house not a mansion a
[1:22:55] body a 22 year old body amen a 21 year
[1:23:00] old body amen but the only way to get
[1:23:03] there is through the spirit of God
[1:23:06] isn't that amazing the very thing
[1:23:09] everybody wants and nobody's willing to
[1:23:12] get in the place that they'll take them
[1:23:13] there it's the Fountain of Youth
[1:23:16] it's the thing that'll do what everybody
[1:23:18] wants it's the spirit of God Amen as it
[1:23:22] says amen that we we've be groaning to
[1:23:25] be clothed upon that the Mortal might be
[1:23:28] swallowed up in life I love that the
[1:23:30] Mortal might be swallowed up in life
[1:23:32] Paul says that II Corinthians 5 amen do
[1:23:35] you see in First Corinthians 15 the
[1:23:37] Bible actually speaks of this and it
[1:23:39] says Death Shall be swallowed up in
[1:23:41] Victory amen death will be swallowed up
[1:23:43] in life amen now what's he talking about
[1:23:46] Paul is talking about amen when the
[1:23:48] final overthrow of the king of Terrors
[1:23:50] y'all know who the king of Terrors is
[1:23:52] don't you it's death
[1:23:54] king of Tears he he has struck homes he
[1:23:57] struck lives he struck throughout the
[1:24:00] ages amen the king of Terror comes when
[1:24:02] we don't want him the king of terrorists
[1:24:04] strikes strikes home strikes families he
[1:24:06] struck our family many times at king
[1:24:09] king of Terror coming terrorized all of
[1:24:11] our plans terrorized everything we're
[1:24:13] going to do but you know I was reading
[1:24:15] this one day and I I read a I read a
[1:24:17] little writing on this for this portion
[1:24:19] it's in the Greek and and it comes up to
[1:24:22] mean this amen that Paul is using this
[1:24:25] in a way that says death is no longer
[1:24:27] Victory amen but he reads it like this
[1:24:30] that it is a final overthrow of the king
[1:24:33] of Terrors can you imagine when the king
[1:24:37] of tires is completely overthrown when
[1:24:40] there is no more death when there is no
[1:24:43] more separation listen what you are
[1:24:46] under this morning is the only thing
[1:24:49] that will destroy the king of Terror and
[1:24:51] take his powers away from the church
[1:24:53] this is the greatest almost ever given
[1:24:55] to a Believer he will swallow up death
[1:24:58] and victory and the Lord God shall wipe
[1:25:01] away our tears from off of our faces and
[1:25:03] the rebuke of this people shall be taken
[1:25:05] away from off of the Earth for the Lord
[1:25:07] has spoken it for the Lord has spoken
[1:25:11] him Hosea 13 and 14 can you pull that up
[1:25:14] man I'll tell you what to be honest this
[1:25:16] is this this little scripture right here
[1:25:17] has probably been one of my favorite
[1:25:19] scriptures I've read in a long time in
[1:25:21] Hosea 13 and 14 amen he says I will
[1:25:25] Ransom them from the power of the grave
[1:25:27] and I will redeem them from Death now he
[1:25:30] speaks to death and says oh death I will
[1:25:33] be thy plagues and oh grave I will be
[1:25:35] thy destruction repentance shall be hid
[1:25:38] from mine eyes I thought oh mercy listen
[1:25:41] this amen all kinds of plagues have come
[1:25:43] upon man there's been the Bubonic plague
[1:25:46] there's been the smallpox plague there's
[1:25:48] been the amen chickenpox and the fevers
[1:25:51] and the influenzas and the Cove heads
[1:25:53] and man has suffered of all kinds of
[1:25:55] plagues but God is looking at death and
[1:25:58] he said I'm going to be your plague can
[1:26:00] you imagine when death heard the
[1:26:03] almighty Eternal Immortal God said I'm
[1:26:06] gonna plague you death and you will
[1:26:08] never be able to repent from my side
[1:26:10] amen there shall never be a place where
[1:26:13] death can hide from The Immortal God
[1:26:15] death amen will be destroyed by the
[1:26:18] presence of the Living God oh death I am
[1:26:21] thy plague my goodness every little bit
[1:26:24] I just get up morning and read that to
[1:26:25] the devil
[1:26:28] I just get up and read it to the devil
[1:26:30] somebody says to me so what do you do
[1:26:31] that for because he's always reminded me
[1:26:33] of my past
[1:26:35] so I'd like to remind him of his future
[1:26:39] I just like the devil to know the same
[1:26:42] one that called Abraham father when he
[1:26:45] was fatherless is the same one that's
[1:26:48] taken this king of Terror who thinks
[1:26:50] he's in the prime of his kingship and
[1:26:53] I'm looking right down the road and I
[1:26:54] say Satan I see your end coming amen I
[1:26:58] see that you had a beginning and I see
[1:27:00] that you got it in and everything that
[1:27:03] you've ever done to my family every hurt
[1:27:05] that you've ever put upon the Church of
[1:27:07] the Living God we are going to throw him
[1:27:09] in the Lake of Fire
[1:27:12] the Bible said that we will throw him in
[1:27:16] the Lake of Fire all hell hates that but
[1:27:19] Satan and his angels will be completely
[1:27:21] annihilated
[1:27:23] there is an end to this devil
[1:27:27] amen this change that I'm talking about
[1:27:29] is a Deliverance
[1:27:31] in Hebrews chapter 2 and 15 it said and
[1:27:34] they will deliver them who through the
[1:27:36] fear of death were a lifetime subject to
[1:27:38] bondage
[1:27:39] Paul in 7 23 in Romans he said I see
[1:27:42] another law and my members warned
[1:27:44] against the law in my mind bringing into
[1:27:46] captivity the law of sin which is in my
[1:27:48] members all wretched man that I am who
[1:27:52] shall deliver me from this body of death
[1:27:54] I thank God through Jesus Christ Our
[1:27:57] Lord so then that the mind I serve the
[1:28:00] law of God but with the law of Flesh the
[1:28:03] law of sin but with the flesh the law of
[1:28:04] sin listen this man o Wretched Man that
[1:28:07] I am we don't have time to preach that
[1:28:09] but but you you you I don't need to
[1:28:11] explain that to anybody born of a woman
[1:28:14] because job said a man born of a woman
[1:28:17] is a few days and full of trouble
[1:28:20] he's a few days and full of trouble
[1:28:23] trouble everywhere that a man is born
[1:28:26] trouble everywhere amen somebody said
[1:28:28] well I tell you what I got saved so I'm
[1:28:30] perfect well amen I want you to stand up
[1:28:32] and let us all admire a perfect person
[1:28:35] because that's what we'd like to do we'd
[1:28:37] like to see one we'd like to see
[1:28:39] somebody
[1:28:40] perfect like won't you go ahead amen I
[1:28:42] think we just love it we put it on
[1:28:44] camera
[1:28:46] we'll tell the world there's a perfect
[1:28:48] person right there
[1:28:51] well ain't nobody stand up y'all must be
[1:28:53] like me
[1:28:56] this is Apostle Paul oh Wretched Man
[1:28:59] that I he's calling himself wretched
[1:29:02] Jacobs and I'm not a worm these men
[1:29:05] understood their littleness as a human
[1:29:07] being they understood amen the need for
[1:29:10] God and the need for the blood and the
[1:29:13] need for the atonement listen the next
[1:29:15] time you go to pile on somebody and
[1:29:17] really get after them I want you to stop
[1:29:19] and think about your need

[1:29:24] I want you to stop and think about your
[1:29:26] need and think about what you would be

[1:30:16] somebody else and want to give them a
[1:30:18] ticket you want to put it on them amen
[1:30:20] why not extend the mercy that God has
[1:30:22] given to you amen David said amen the
[1:30:25] mercies of God Amen they're new every
[1:30:27] morning
[1:30:29] my goodness what we would if we got what
[1:30:32] we deserved it'd be death hell in the
[1:30:34] grave but God who is rich in Mercy
[1:30:37] didn't give us what we deserve but he
[1:30:39] gave us Grace and he revealed the
[1:30:42] message of the hour to us and sent us in
[1:30:45] this building this morning believing God
[1:30:47] and knowing god and trusting God Amen I
[1:30:50] tell you thank God for his Mercy this
[1:30:52] morning
[1:30:53] Hallelujah some hours say hallelujah
[1:30:55] praise be to our God who gives us Mercy
[1:30:59] who shall deliver this body of death now
[1:31:01] Paul knew it Paul knew he needed
[1:31:03] deliverance from this Wretched Man and
[1:31:06] he had no he had no justification for it
[1:31:08] he had no way to say what it was he knew
[1:31:11] he needed it but he said I thank God
[1:31:13] through our Jesus Christ the mind I
[1:31:16] serve myself serve the law of God but
[1:31:18] with the law of Flesh the law of sin but
[1:31:21] now there is now no condemnation
[1:31:25] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[1:31:28] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:31:30] spirit for the law of the spirit of Life
[1:31:33] somebody shout the law of Life the law
[1:31:36] of the spirit of Life do you see amen
[1:31:38] there it is brother random in
[1:31:39] restoration the Bright Tree saying when
[1:31:41] the word is spoken there's a law that
[1:31:44] goes with that word and that's the law
[1:31:46] of life when he said Abraham thou are
[1:31:49] the father that was the law behind that
[1:31:51] word it's the law of life it could take
[1:31:54] an old man and make him young again it
[1:31:56] was a long life a superseded the
[1:31:59] wrinkles in his body the gray hair in
[1:32:01] his hand and gave him back youth because
[1:32:04] the law of life was at work I know the
[1:32:07] law of gravity is working on your arms
[1:32:09] and your legs and your hair and your
[1:32:11] life and the law of gravity is at work
[1:32:14] amen I don't know of a better example I
[1:32:16] wish I had a better one but I don't know
[1:32:17] of a better one than the law of gravity
[1:32:19] working Amen to keep you on the ground
[1:32:22] but the law of aerodynamics has worked
[1:32:24] to put you in the air
[1:32:27] anybody ever wrote a Jet Plane knows the
[1:32:29] laws there's two laws and they exist at
[1:32:32] the same time but the law of
[1:32:34] aerodynamics gives you the power to
[1:32:36] supersede the other law it doesn't do
[1:32:38] away with it it gives you something that
[1:32:40] supersedes it amen and you're sitting
[1:32:42] here saying I'm yet in the human body
[1:32:45] but I'm saying there's another law I
[1:32:47] know you're getting older but there's
[1:32:48] another law I know your life looks like
[1:32:51] it's ending but there's another law it's
[1:32:53] the law of life amen that God will
[1:32:56] change our body and this law that is
[1:32:59] working on the inside of us there is no
[1:33:02] condition that can stop it amen there's
[1:33:04] not enough devils in hell that can
[1:33:06] arrest and put back the law of almighty
[1:33:09] God his word has spoken it and so shall
[1:33:12] it come to pass because there is a law
[1:33:17] there is a law
[1:33:19] and that is a law that supersedes all
[1:33:22] other laws isn't that powerful the law
[1:33:25] of God
[1:33:26] how it supersedes it
[1:33:28] Amen to bring it forces
[1:33:32] hey man y'all know what the law of life
[1:33:33] is don't you brother man said here's the
[1:33:36] law of life I already done it
[1:33:38] he said there was two laws in
[1:33:40] Deuteronomy he said watch that out there
[1:33:43] on Mount Sinai there's your law of death
[1:33:45] he said but watch Mount Calvary there's
[1:33:48] your law of life I have already blessed
[1:33:51] thee Abraham I have already did it
[1:33:54] Abraham I'm going to call you a father
[1:33:56] and you ain't a father yet but I've
[1:33:58] already done it I've already provided
[1:34:00] the way to do it it's already coming you
[1:34:02] you see what he's doing he's showing you
[1:34:04] there is laws that is existing on the
[1:34:07] inside of you right now listen what you
[1:34:09] need for a Rapture is not coming
[1:34:13] what you need for a Rapture amen what
[1:34:16] Apostle Peter needed to survive the
[1:34:18] storm was already on the boat what Rahab
[1:34:21] needed Amen to get out of Jericho was in
[1:34:24] the house the tenth coin was laying in
[1:34:27] the floor she just had to find it and
[1:34:29] what you need is already in you if you
[1:34:32] have the Holy Ghost everything you need
[1:34:35] for a Rapture is already on the inside
[1:34:37] of you you don't need you don't need you
[1:34:40] need to realize what God has already
[1:34:43] invested in the church he's already put
[1:34:46] it in it and it's in a law when God gave
[1:34:48] you the word the law of God can work on
[1:34:51] that word the law amen it's a law and it
[1:34:55] has been amen it has been put against
[1:34:58] the sentence of death that works in you
[1:35:00] so there's a sentence against you
[1:35:02] because of the word of God
[1:35:04] but there's another law
[1:35:07] and it's the law of Mount Calvary the
[1:35:09] law of life
[1:35:11] now Paul says this in second Corinthians
[1:35:14] chapter 1 verse 9. I think it's powerful
[1:35:16] he said but we had the sentence of death
[1:35:18] within ourselves that we should not
[1:35:20] trust in ourselves
[1:35:21] now
[1:35:22] there's not enough time to preach these
[1:35:24] scriptures but I'll read them to you we
[1:35:26] cannot trust within ourselves do you see
[1:35:28] you hear this Paul don't trust yourself
[1:35:30] for this change
[1:35:33] don't trust in yourself don't trust in
[1:35:36] yourself because in God is he that
[1:35:40] raiseth the Dead
[1:35:42] now who delivered us from so great at
[1:35:45] death and doeth deliverer in whom we
[1:35:48] trust that he will deliver us so Paul is
[1:35:51] calling this a great Deliverance in
[1:35:54] first Thessalonians chapter 1 and verse
[1:35:55] 10 he said and to wait for the son from
[1:35:58] Heaven whom raised the dead even Jesus
[1:36:00] which delivered us from the Wrath which
[1:36:03] is to come isn't that amazing he
[1:36:06] delivered us from death
[1:36:08] our God is a great deliverer and he has
[1:36:11] delivered us from it now our lord Jesus
[1:36:14] according to First Timothy 6 and verse
[1:36:16] 15 he said he will show himself alive he
[1:36:20] says which in times he shall show who is
[1:36:22] the blessed and only potentate the King
[1:36:24] of Kings and the Lord of lords who only
[1:36:27] hath immortality dwelling in light which
[1:36:30] no man can approach unto which no man
[1:36:32] has seen nor can see and whom we honor
[1:36:35] and power Everlasting amen
[1:36:38] now look Paul is saying God's going to
[1:36:41] show who it is that has this power
[1:36:44] amen God is going to show this now
[1:36:47] that's why I said what do you mean show
[1:36:49] he's going to reveal this power to a
[1:36:52] generation how many knows what
[1:36:53] generation will see it
[1:36:55] according to Luke 17 30 there will come
[1:36:59] a day of the revealing of the son of man
[1:37:01] which will be done under the Malachi 4
[1:37:04] Ministry which is the eagle revealing
[1:37:08] the great power that God has exhibited
[1:37:11] into this age whatever God reveals
[1:37:14] belongs to the church whatever God opens
[1:37:18] belongs to the church and he's going to
[1:37:20] show who is the Blessed potentate he's
[1:37:23] going to show who is the king of all
[1:37:25] Kings who is the Lord of all Lords who
[1:37:28] has immortality and power can you
[1:37:30] imagine brother Adam standing on the
[1:37:32] platform in front of thousands and
[1:37:33] thousands and thousands of people and
[1:37:35] saying I take every spirit
[1:37:38] under my control
[1:37:41] I'm a brother
[1:37:43] he said preacher what is that I tell you
[1:37:45] what the kingdom of God has come nigh
[1:37:47] unto thee
[1:37:50] when one man could subdue an entire
[1:37:53] realm of spirits
[1:37:56] now you said preacher why would you put
[1:37:57] that because God was revealing
[1:38:00] God was revealing something to the
[1:38:02] church he was telling you that by faith
[1:38:05] they subdue kingdoms by faith they done
[1:38:08] these things the message has given Faith
[1:38:10] to a Believer listen I don't know what
[1:38:12] kind of circumstances you're in but let
[1:38:14] me assure you something you can subdue
[1:38:16] that circumstance the same way that a
[1:38:19] prophet subdue he said preacher amen I
[1:38:21] don't know how to do it and and brother
[1:38:23] random himself didn't even know he had
[1:38:25] it in him at times until he until he
[1:38:28] crosses the fence and runs out across
[1:38:30] the field and here comes a killer Bull
[1:38:32] and when that bull got into the
[1:38:34] atmosphere of that Prophet it laid down
[1:38:36] under the tree
[1:38:38] because he had What it Took already in
[1:38:41] him and the church already has what it
[1:38:44] takes on the inside of them you just
[1:38:47] don't know yet what really is on the
[1:38:49] inside of you until it's pressed
[1:38:53] my goodness I feel something in the
[1:38:55] building I might as well go ahead and
[1:38:56] preach it listen you you you are looking
[1:38:58] at the situation like it's come to
[1:39:01] destroy you and it's come to prove you
[1:39:03] it's not come to take you it's come to
[1:39:06] make you shine in A Realm of Darkness
[1:39:08] and to show this world
[1:39:12] to show this world
[1:39:14] exactly a believer in how they approach
[1:39:17] a trial
[1:39:19] my goodness when I think about this I
[1:39:22] think about the pressing of an
[1:39:24] individual to show that God is showing
[1:39:27] God is showing this for a purpose in
[1:39:30] Colossians chapter 3 and verse 4 he said
[1:39:32] when Christ who is our life shall appear
[1:39:34] then shall we also appear with him in
[1:39:36] glory when Christ is now if you're not
[1:39:39] careful you put that out to the physical
[1:39:41] Return of the Lord Jesus in his own
[1:39:43] physical body amen but listen I don't
[1:39:45] know if you know this but we need the
[1:39:47] glory of God today
[1:39:49] we need the glory of God today somebody
[1:39:52] said what's his glory brother man said
[1:39:54] signs Miracles and wonders
[1:39:57] remember that when Moses said God said
[1:40:00] to him go down there and deliver them
[1:40:02] people Moses said wait a minute I've
[1:40:04] already tried that
[1:40:07] but when Christ who is his life
[1:40:10] appeared in that bush Hebrews 11 says
[1:40:13] that he suffered the reproach of Christ
[1:40:15] it was Christ that appeared to Moses in
[1:40:18] that bush and it lit the fire on the
[1:40:21] inside of the man who had tried to do
[1:40:23] something intellectually but when God
[1:40:25] spoke to him he went down there as a
[1:40:28] one-man Army and subdued the entire
[1:40:30] nation because God had revealed to him
[1:40:33] as Glory you say how did God do it I
[1:40:35] tell you what he said to him he said
[1:40:36] what's that in your hand Moses and Moses
[1:40:39] throw down the rod and picked it up put
[1:40:41] his hand in his vest and pulled it out
[1:40:44] and he saw the supernatural workings of
[1:40:47] An Almighty God and let me say this just
[1:40:49] because other people impersonated it
[1:40:51] don't make it fake brother just because
[1:40:53] other people put on it don't make it
[1:40:56] fake when God gives something to a
[1:40:58] church or to a people I don't care how
[1:41:01] many false prophets and how many first
[1:41:03] impersonators that rise up it's still
[1:41:06] true anyhow
[1:41:09] he said preacher why would you say it
[1:41:11] because I heard brother man say it on
[1:41:12] tape this morning he said that's exactly
[1:41:14] what happened with shamgar's day he said
[1:41:16] just about the time they had a good
[1:41:18] Revival he said some outfits rose up
[1:41:20] among them and he said started out with
[1:41:22] every kind of fanaticism he said which
[1:41:24] tried to kill the Revival he said but as
[1:41:27] Shankar didn't put up with it he took
[1:41:30] what he had in his hand and beat down
[1:41:32] those emotional ideas until he had a
[1:41:35] liberty that he could keep the Revival
[1:41:37] God had sent him
[1:41:39] hey man I know what I'm talking about
[1:41:41] every time God really starts moving
[1:41:43] Among Us amen somebody takes off into a
[1:41:45] certain realm he was well that's an
[1:41:47] impersonation and that's an
[1:41:48] impersonation and it takes away the
[1:41:51] glory of God that he is performing Among
[1:41:53] Us and putting in our churches amen so
[1:41:56] every devil Out of Hell raises up and
[1:41:58] tries to say this and tries to say that
[1:41:59] well I say it's time pick up your Oxnard
[1:42:02] and put that devil back in his place I
[1:42:04] think it's time to quit lending ears to
[1:42:06] devils and taking attacks against Good
[1:42:09] Men of God and put that devil right back
[1:42:11] in his place and say Satan you're not
[1:42:14] welcome in the house of God Amen my ears
[1:42:17] are not trash cans
[1:42:22] you
[1:42:23] you said preacher I don't have time to
[1:42:25] go get no training I don't have time to
[1:42:27] go figure out how to defeat this devil I
[1:42:29] tell you how you do it you don't have to
[1:42:31] leave this meeting you take the word of
[1:42:33] God that's in you right now and begin to
[1:42:35] fight against that devil and say Satan
[1:42:37] you're not taking another service you're
[1:42:39] not taking another Revival you're not
[1:42:41] taking another meeting from me this is
[1:42:43] my morning this is a morning for my
[1:42:45] children this is a morning for our
[1:42:47] family I'm gonna beat down every devil
[1:42:50] until I see the presence of God until
[1:42:52] the fire of God drops in my
[1:42:56] I think it's time to fight your way out
[1:42:58] I know the devil's tried to harness you
[1:43:01] up I know he's trying to put you in a
[1:43:03] place that you can't explain I say it's
[1:43:05] time to kick loose
[1:43:10] [Music]
[1:43:11] mother bam said that was a problem with
[1:43:13] people today he said they take fired up
[1:43:16] preachers and put them through their
[1:43:17] theological seminaries until they take
[1:43:20] all the preacher out of them
[1:43:22] and he said they harness them down in
[1:43:24] theology
[1:43:26] brother man said they've been a lot
[1:43:27] better off without the Theology and went
[1:43:30] and preached why there was some fire in
[1:43:31] their heart amen you said what are they
[1:43:33] going to preach another man said if you
[1:43:34] ain't got nothing else tell them how
[1:43:36] your candle got lit
[1:43:38] and say what would that do because
[1:43:40] somebody looking for change you can tell
[1:43:42] them I can't explain it but I was this
[1:43:45] way and the spirit of God coming I'm
[1:43:47] this way now
[1:43:49] I'd like to see that in scripture okay
[1:43:51] look over there when Elijah was setting
[1:43:53] it to Brookshire and the Ravens brought
[1:43:55] him fish or brought him meat and brought
[1:43:58] him brought him food brother man said he
[1:44:00] said where did it come from he said the
[1:44:01] critics of where did it come from he
[1:44:03] said he said Elijah didn't ask he just
[1:44:06] ate it and they said brother random word
[1:44:08] of the Holy Ghost come from brother man
[1:44:10] said I don't know I just eat it he said
[1:44:13] God brings it and I just eat it amen I'm
[1:44:15] not going to question God but when the
[1:44:17] Holy Ghost comes I'm going to feed upon
[1:44:20] the spirit of God until every demon is
[1:44:23] pushed back and the liberty of God and
[1:44:26] the faith of God can come upon it
[1:44:30] when Christ who is our last shall appear
[1:44:32] they will come a power in the church to
[1:44:35] subdue every devil to subdue every
[1:44:37] problem to subdue every issue Devil's
[1:44:40] popping up like Pop-Tarts
[1:44:42] y'all know it's the truth
[1:44:46] that's the best way to say it ain't they
[1:44:47] come out of nowhere
[1:44:48] [Applause]
[1:44:50] you think everything's going okay
[1:44:53] but the devil been cooking up something
[1:44:54] for a while and all of a sudden it pops
[1:44:57] up
[1:44:58] well I'm gonna tell you something
[1:45:00] brother bam said that's what happened to
[1:45:01] Moses he said when that when that
[1:45:03] Philistine Army showed up at the Red
[1:45:04] Banks he said it was showed up overnight
[1:45:06] he said and it was a mushroom and he
[1:45:09] said anything shows up that fast Gonna
[1:45:11] Leave fast too
[1:45:14] it's a preacher all of a sudden you just
[1:45:16] don't know how to handle it let me tell
[1:45:17] you just stand still a minute and watch
[1:45:19] the god of Abraham handle it watch how
[1:45:22] God how God is a God of War he's a god
[1:45:25] of battle if you'll hold your peace and
[1:45:28] just keep believing this word the god of
[1:45:30] Abraham will send all the wrongs right
[1:45:33] and bring life back where it belongs
[1:45:35] because he's still God
[1:45:39] he shall appear
[1:45:41] and when he does
[1:45:43] he will subdue it all do you know that
[1:45:45] you had the message right now to whip
[1:45:47] any devil
[1:45:48] anywhere
[1:45:50] any place any time in any form it comes
[1:45:55] so how am I going to do that the prophet
[1:45:57] said the word was the weapon of the
[1:46:00] spirit
[1:46:01] you've been given a word for the season
[1:46:04] you're living in in other words what you
[1:46:06] need to whip the devil God's already
[1:46:08] gave it to you
[1:46:10] now
[1:46:12] it's amazing because what we see in the
[1:46:15] scripture is Paul said that the Lord is
[1:46:17] that spirit
[1:46:18] and where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:46:20] there's liberty
[1:46:21] Now isn't it amazing that Paul calls the
[1:46:23] Lord a spirit
[1:46:25] you all know why he'd do that don't you
[1:46:27] because over there in the book of Acts
[1:46:29] when he was yet unconverted and he was
[1:46:31] fighting the church he met that light
[1:46:34] and he said I am Jesus whom thou
[1:46:36] persecutes
[1:46:37] he knew
[1:46:39] that the capital Ella or D was a spirit
[1:46:44] when Paul saw him in that light
[1:46:47] that's the same light that returns to
[1:46:50] the church and Paul says when Christ who
[1:46:53] is our life shall appear
[1:46:55] isn't that amazing when he comes among
[1:46:58] us we'll be like him and share in his
[1:47:00] glory
[1:47:01] because he's revealing who he is
[1:47:04] revealing what he does and Under that
[1:47:07] Revelation see the Lord is that Spirit
[1:47:10] where the spirit Lord is there is
[1:47:12] Liberty now in first Thessalonians 4 I'm
[1:47:14] just going to give this for the
[1:47:15] scripture so to back the point for the
[1:47:18] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:47:20] with a shout the Lord himself the Lord
[1:47:23] is that spirit
[1:47:26] right the Lord is the the Lord himself
[1:47:29] shall descend from heaven with Liberty
[1:47:32] to look Beyond the Veil
[1:47:34] see nobody saw what you're seeing
[1:47:37] as long as it's a secret it's hid when
[1:47:40] it's revealed it belongs
[1:47:42] nobody has come into the possession that
[1:47:45] this bride has come into see a man does
[1:47:47] not unveil himself in the public it's
[1:47:50] only before his bride
[1:47:52] he does that in Revelation that's why
[1:47:55] the scripture said the Lord himself
[1:47:57] should descend from heaven but the world
[1:47:59] won't see this and Jesus said they
[1:48:00] wouldn't he said yet a little while the
[1:48:02] world seeth me no more
[1:48:05] so just because somebody else can't see
[1:48:07] it don't mean it ain't happening
[1:48:11] it's actually a promise they won't see
[1:48:13] it
[1:48:14] don't get mad at them if God didn't give
[1:48:17] you the Liberty you wouldn't see it
[1:48:20] but because God who is rich in Mercy has
[1:48:23] sent forth the spirit of his son not
[1:48:26] giving you the spirit of fear but the
[1:48:29] spirit of adoption causing you to have
[1:48:32] Liberty to come into the presence of God
[1:48:35] and see things that Kings have longed to
[1:48:37] see and hear things that angels have not
[1:48:40] heard amen but we are now the amen the
[1:48:43] adopted manifested sons of the Living
[1:48:46] God Amen not because of who we are but
[1:48:49] because of what God is revealed to us he
[1:48:53] has set us in a station or a position of
[1:48:55] Life a position of authority he has gave
[1:48:59] us the secrets of his kingdom the
[1:49:01] secrets of the Warfare the secrets of
[1:49:03] exposing the devil he has revealed to us
[1:49:06] how to defeat this devil always
[1:49:11] now I know the devil would like us to
[1:49:12] forget that but I'm not going to
[1:49:16] now notice in second Corinthians chapter
[1:49:18] 3 and verse 8 watch 18 watch Paul say it
[1:49:21] with an open face
[1:49:24] an unveiled face beholding as in the
[1:49:26] glass the glory of the Lord isn't that
[1:49:28] amazing it doesn't just say to behold
[1:49:31] beholding
[1:49:33] so it's not just one look at it
[1:49:35] it's a continual look
[1:49:38] and Satan will constantly try to get you
[1:49:41] to look just look off
[1:49:43] you remember you remember the prophet
[1:49:45] taught on the serpent Charming the bird
[1:49:47] y'all remember that
[1:49:49] and Brother Band said how is it that
[1:49:50] that serpent can get the bird out of the
[1:49:52] air he said he paralyzes him with the
[1:49:55] hypnotism of stare and he said if that
[1:49:58] bird ever looks in the eyes of the
[1:49:59] serpent he said he charms him and pulls
[1:50:01] him right into his mouth
[1:50:02] teaching us what you look at is the way
[1:50:05] you go
[1:50:07] you start looking at problems there you
[1:50:10] go
[1:50:11] you start looking at issues there you go
[1:50:13] hey man one one I got hurt as a young
[1:50:16] man in a wreck with a buddy of mine he
[1:50:18] bought a brand new truck I mean it was
[1:50:20] brand new he's going fishing it's about
[1:50:22] six in the morning that's about half
[1:50:23] time we stayed up two o'clock morning
[1:50:25] get up six go fishing that's only guys
[1:50:27] will do that never for work but for
[1:50:29] fishing
[1:50:30] sleep just two hours gotta go fishing
[1:50:32] you know we get up the next morning
[1:50:34] we're driving down the highway it's only
[1:50:35] about 40 mile an hour so I'm gonna drive
[1:50:36] down through there and he's looking for
[1:50:38] something and it's behind me behind my
[1:50:40] seat in the king cab and he reaches over
[1:50:42] behind me and he can't feel it so he
[1:50:43] just looks next thing I know I wake up
[1:50:45] in the dash we hit a Tom's truck on the
[1:50:48] side of the road things setting dead
[1:50:50] still but the minute he looked this way
[1:50:52] he just pulled the steering wheel that
[1:50:53] way and we crashed right into it hey man
[1:50:56] what no fault of mine but the guy
[1:50:58] driving got to look in the wrong
[1:50:59] direction
[1:51:00] amen and if you look a certain way
[1:51:02] that's the way you're going
[1:51:04] amen so that's why Paul said keep your
[1:51:07] eyes
[1:51:08] beholding him amen and it will change
[1:51:11] you into the same image can you imagine
[1:51:13] amen that if you keep watching God you
[1:51:17] start moving toward God you're beholding
[1:51:20] him and it is changing you now watch
[1:51:22] what he said let not your heart be
[1:51:24] troubled you believed in God believe
[1:51:25] also in me that in my father's house are
[1:51:27] many mansions and if it were not so I
[1:51:30] would have told you I'd go to prepare a
[1:51:32] place and if I go to prepare a place I
[1:51:35] will come again and receive you unto
[1:51:38] myself that where I am there you shall
[1:51:41] be also isn't that beautiful you said
[1:51:44] preacher how's he going to do it he
[1:51:46] meant he's sending a message to receive
[1:51:48] you
[1:51:49] what you have received of the Lord is
[1:51:53] his reception power to take you into the
[1:51:56] rapture
[1:51:57] it's a it's it's a it's a best way I
[1:52:00] know how to say it is this is what the
[1:52:02] way God reaches down to take the church
[1:52:05] is by the word now it's to make its
[1:52:08] claim on you this word is made a claim
[1:52:11] on your life how many remembers when
[1:52:12] they first heard the message
[1:52:14] all them things you were doing and it
[1:52:17] just changed
[1:52:19] it just changed circumstance it changed
[1:52:22] relationships things that you had
[1:52:24] planned things things you're going to do
[1:52:26] amen church and things and ideas and all
[1:52:30] of a sudden God began to reveal this to
[1:52:32] you and it literally claimed your life
[1:52:37] it's amazing thing when you feel the
[1:52:40] claim of God come on you when you feel
[1:52:42] that God says you're mine
[1:52:45] that's a powerful feeling you belong to
[1:52:48] me and you're sitting there arguing now
[1:52:51] God see there's this and and there's
[1:52:53] this and and there's this and you know
[1:52:55] after all there's this and then you
[1:52:58] start trying to give all these excuses
[1:52:59] and then you start reading the message
[1:53:01] of the hour and you see the very man he
[1:53:04] called to deliver the message when the
[1:53:07] angel came to him he's carrying water to
[1:53:10] a moonshine Steel
[1:53:13] he's got the water to illegal alcohol in
[1:53:17] his hand when God comes to him
[1:53:21] he's not going to the altar he's not
[1:53:24] working at the church he's not preaching
[1:53:26] the angel came to him because he was
[1:53:30] predestinated of God to carry this
[1:53:33] message and he wanted him to know don't
[1:53:35] you drink or smoke or defile your body
[1:53:37] because you belong to me and I'm going
[1:53:40] to do this with your life and when God
[1:53:42] claimed brother random he claimed him
[1:53:44] without excuse amen he could offer
[1:53:46] nothing that God would accept amen you
[1:53:49] know what that's telling me it's telling
[1:53:50] me I don't care what your parents are I
[1:53:53] don't care what your church was like I
[1:53:55] don't care what your childhood was like
[1:53:57] listen I don't want to hear how you was
[1:53:59] a mess in your teenage years or what you
[1:54:02] did or didn't do amen I tell you what I
[1:54:04] want to hear amen yes Lord yes Lord yes
[1:54:08] Lord because the god of Abraham claims a
[1:54:11] church and when he claims that bride
[1:54:13] every problem you have every situation
[1:54:16] every insecurity all of your Humanity
[1:54:19] all of your complexes he blames you
[1:54:22] because he predestinated you and you can
[1:54:24] run if you want to but you'll never
[1:54:26] outrun the presence of the Living God
[1:54:29] David said though I make my bed in hell
[1:54:32] he'll find me there Jonah went into the
[1:54:35] belly of the well and God found him
[1:54:37] there and he found you maybe on a bar
[1:54:39] stool maybe he found you in a church
[1:54:41] maybe he found you on the street but the
[1:54:43] God who is rich in Mercy said I will
[1:54:46] have a bride and he claimed you for it
[1:54:51] when God begins to reach you know what
[1:54:54] he does amen he claims you for this
[1:54:56] message you know this message is
[1:54:58] claiming you for a rapture
[1:55:01] God didn't disclaim you he claims you
[1:55:04] for a change he claims you to exhibit
[1:55:07] his power over death it's amazing in
[1:55:10] Hebrews 9 he said them who often have
[1:55:13] suffered since the foundation of the
[1:55:14] world but now once in the end of the
[1:55:16] world hath he appeared to put away sin
[1:55:18] by the sacrifice of himself and it is
[1:55:21] unappointed unto men wants to die but
[1:55:25] after that the Judgment so Christ was
[1:55:27] offered to Bear the sins of many and
[1:55:29] unto them that look for him shall he
[1:55:31] appear the second time without sin unto
[1:55:35] salvation you said preacher what are you
[1:55:37] saying I'm saying God just called in and
[1:55:39] broke all of your appointments
[1:55:42] I'm saying that God called in and broke
[1:55:45] all the appointments you have you got
[1:55:47] plans you got situations you got things
[1:55:49] you're going to do and God has said no
[1:55:52] you have been claimed for my portion of
[1:55:55] this word in this generation do you see
[1:55:58] God breaks appointments for you and you
[1:56:01] you can plan amen the plans of men is so
[1:56:03] easy isn't it you can plan everything
[1:56:05] out how you're going to do it how it's
[1:56:06] going to be and then somebody else
[1:56:08] annoying to you breaks the whole thing
[1:56:12] takes one little individual amen we had
[1:56:15] plans amen and that little unborn baby
[1:56:18] amen and Zach's have another child and
[1:56:21] that's why Chris is not with us it's
[1:56:22] actually a premature labor is trying to
[1:56:25] come on so she had the rest of Chris and
[1:56:26] stayed home take care of her amen God
[1:56:28] bless Chris she's a real mother she
[1:56:30] she's a she's a Dandy amen God give us a
[1:56:33] Grace when he gave us that lady and you
[1:56:35] know as as a mother but watch that
[1:56:38] little child broke all of our plans
[1:56:40] that's coming next week
[1:56:42] amen it's so easy for somebody else to
[1:56:45] break your plans but the man that's
[1:56:47] breaking your plans with death is the
[1:56:50] almighty God he has said Death Shall be
[1:56:53] disannulled and your agreement with hell
[1:56:55] shall not stand I don't care if you've
[1:56:58] carried that agreement in your life your
[1:57:01] whole life death has rained your whole
[1:57:03] life death has since you belong to him
[1:57:06] but the god of mercy and of life has
[1:57:08] said I didn't say no your agreement that
[1:57:10] you made with hell you belong to me
[1:57:15] oh I remember when the sentence of death
[1:57:18] was broken over my life and the law of
[1:57:20] life began to be moved on the inside of
[1:57:22] me
[1:57:24] that's when the grace of God begin to
[1:57:27] deal with our hearts now the prophet of
[1:57:29] God tells us this he tells us that God
[1:57:31] is going to have awakened time
[1:57:34] for the people that sleep in the do you
[1:57:36] know the people that have went on we'll
[1:57:38] just take a few of them brother Frazier
[1:57:40] uh that used to be your pastor sister
[1:57:42] Connie's dad do you know that he's now I
[1:57:46] hope y'all don't get bothered at me but
[1:57:48] you all know that he's not a million
[1:57:50] miles from the meeting this morning
[1:57:54] if you want to get down to it
[1:57:56] brother Brown said the only thing
[1:57:58] separate you from seeing him is the veil
[1:58:00] of the flesh
[1:58:02] so the
[1:58:03] the living Saints
[1:58:06] who have went beyond the Veil
[1:58:08] are right Among Us
[1:58:13] now I know we get to thinking
[1:58:15] that there's someone who's way off
[1:58:18] and Heaven is way off
[1:58:20] but your thought is way wrong
[1:58:26] Heaven is not a million miles from here
[1:58:31] this is the prophet of God said there'll
[1:58:33] come a time they'll be awaking and he
[1:58:35] said those that are asleep in the
[1:58:36] decibel he said they'll begin to they'll
[1:58:39] begin to rise he said some won't wake up
[1:58:41] for another thousand years he says some
[1:58:44] of those corruptable bodies were put on
[1:58:45] incorruption and in the rapturing grace
[1:58:48] of the Lord we'll be caught up together
[1:58:49] when they begin to get together then we
[1:58:52] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:58:55] changed these mortal bodies will not see
[1:58:58] death but just of a sudden there will be
[1:59:00] a sweep over us and we'll be changed
[1:59:05] turned back like Abraham
[1:59:08] from an old man to a young woman from an
[1:59:11] old woman to a young woman
[1:59:13] there's a sudden change and after a
[1:59:16] while you'll be traveling like a thought
[1:59:17] and you'll see those who are already
[1:59:19] resurrected just before Abraham's
[1:59:22] changed somebody called him a father
[1:59:24] the same one that spoke to Abraham is
[1:59:28] speaking these quotes to you
[1:59:32] the message of the hour came from the
[1:59:36] same source that stood at the tent door
[1:59:38] of Abraham and spoke to him and said
[1:59:41] thou are the father of Nations and when
[1:59:44] he prophesied over him the chains
[1:59:47] followed behind it the same one
[1:59:50] has prophesied over this bride there is
[1:59:53] a change Upon Us amen the spoken word
[1:59:56] has already been spoken over you I don't
[1:59:59] know the condition but I know the god
[2:00:00] that spoke it your body seems to maybe
[2:00:03] and it's not complying but let me
[2:00:05] promise you this if it's not today it'll
[2:00:07] be tomorrow if it's not tomorrow it'll
[2:00:09] be the next day and if it's not the next
[2:00:11] day it'll be the next day one thing that
[2:00:14] I'm certain of there is a change coming
[2:00:16] upon the Church of the Living God God
[2:00:19] has spoken it and nothing can change
[2:00:21] what God has spoken our bodies will
[2:00:24] change that word is not going to change
[2:00:28] brother Bram said them that are dead in
[2:00:30] Christ shall rise first and appear to
[2:00:31] many and all at once you'll see
[2:00:33] something begins to stand there and look
[2:00:35] at you and there's a brother and you
[2:00:38] know it ain't long in a few minutes
[2:00:39] we'll be changed
[2:00:41] now if you're if you're studying the
[2:00:44] message and I won't go deep in this but
[2:00:46] I'll just say this very clearly if
[2:00:48] you're studying the message you're going
[2:00:49] to find brother Brown say two certain
[2:00:51] things about the change he'll say some
[2:00:54] people are alive
[2:00:56] he says and they'll look over and
[2:00:59] they'll see the resurrected Saint and
[2:01:01] it'll change them
[2:01:04] in the other quotes he'll say you're
[2:01:07] going to be standing there something's
[2:01:08] going to sweep over you you're going to
[2:01:10] change and then
[2:01:12] you will see the resurrected Saints
[2:01:14] and somebody said brother Wayne which is
[2:01:16] it listen as long as you're changed
[2:01:24] as long as you're changed
[2:01:28] do you see what the devil would do is
[2:01:30] get us arguing over that point
[2:01:33] and get your mind off of a promise
[2:01:36] you're going to be changed
[2:01:39] amen you just got given a new Corvette
[2:01:42] who cares if it was Pennzoil or
[2:01:47] I ain't going to take it it's got pins
[2:01:48] all in it
[2:01:54] do you see what it is we'll be changed
[2:01:56] in the moment of a twinkling of an eye
[2:01:58] and we'll be together with them and then
[2:02:01] go missing on the earth now there's a
[2:02:03] beautiful scripture here in Matthew 27
[2:02:06] the grace were open to many bodies of
[2:02:08] saints with slope arose and they come
[2:02:09] out of the Graze and after the
[2:02:10] resurrection when the holy city and
[2:02:12] appeared unto many
[2:02:13] and appeared unto many now of course
[2:02:16] this is where brother Branham draws this
[2:02:19] thought in letting off a pressure
[2:02:20] brother bam said next thing there will
[2:02:22] be a sweep and a little group will get
[2:02:24] together in a month or so she'll be gone
[2:02:26] and she's gathered together we're at the
[2:02:28] end in Acts chapter 1 and verse 3 the
[2:02:31] Bible said being seen of them forty days
[2:02:35] so you hear people say well it'll be 30
[2:02:37] or 40 days now some people thinks that's
[2:02:39] preaching return Ministry well if you
[2:02:41] think Wayne rosson believes in return
[2:02:42] minutes to you have lost your mind
[2:02:48] I'm saying that is as open as I know how
[2:02:51] because I think it's a horrid teaching
[2:02:55] the only way I believe return Ministry
[2:02:57] I'm gonna tell you how I believe it I
[2:02:58] believe that William Branham went out
[2:03:00] west and met the angels of the Lord and
[2:03:02] the Lord said to him go back east and
[2:03:04] preach the Seven Seals he returned
[2:03:08] and preached the Seven Seals so what you
[2:03:12] have for Rapture what you need for
[2:03:14] Rapture is already here now the prophet
[2:03:16] of God said some of them will be sitting
[2:03:18] at a table one of these mornings he said
[2:03:20] one of them be taking the other left
[2:03:22] amen what is it brother bran begins to
[2:03:24] talk about you'll be standing there
[2:03:26] feeling the change and the wrinkles will
[2:03:27] fall away and they'll be changed in the
[2:03:29] moment of die say preacher what are you
[2:03:30] talking about I'm talking about some of
[2:03:32] you have mothers
[2:03:34] that you could go home and be cooking
[2:03:37] your beans tonight
[2:03:40] and look over and see one of them stand
[2:03:42] in your kitchen
[2:03:45] now this is almost shocking
[2:03:47] but you know that we're living in such a
[2:03:49] season we're able to look up brother
[2:03:50] Frazier come walking down the aisle
[2:03:56] we're living in such a season Charlie
[2:03:58] Spencer might come into somebody said
[2:04:00] well brother Wayne you're crazy I'm not
[2:04:01] crazy amen the times that we're living
[2:04:04] amen the dimensions themselves are
[2:04:06] blending so much that God had a prophet
[2:04:10] stand on the earth and tell you exactly
[2:04:12] what was happening in another dimension
[2:04:14] he wasn't leaving the building when he
[2:04:16] began to say over your head is a lie and
[2:04:19] you did this and you said that and this
[2:04:21] was over here and he said there's a
[2:04:22] woman hooded for death and there's this
[2:04:24] and what was he doing he was standing on
[2:04:27] the platform never left the building
[2:04:29] showing you that God and the devils and
[2:04:32] the angels and everything is right here
[2:04:34] in the building where you're sitting
[2:04:36] here this morning amen everything is
[2:04:38] going on right around you listen this is
[2:04:41] the very thing amen we're going to meet
[2:04:42] one another brother bam says it like
[2:04:44] this in the Paradox one of the greatest
[2:04:46] uh little quotes he said oh what a
[2:04:48] worship time it'll be he says we're
[2:04:50] going to get together you know he said
[2:04:52] that he said the reason being if you got
[2:04:54] loved ones that's went on he said you're
[2:04:56] going to say did they make it
[2:04:59] and he said you're going to meet them
[2:05:00] before you meet Jesus so as to get all
[2:05:03] that out of the way
[2:05:04] because when a man goes to meet Jesus
[2:05:07] amen the only thing that will be on our
[2:05:10] mind
[2:05:10] is the nail scarred hands of our Lord
[2:05:13] Jesus Christ the nail scarred feet of
[2:05:16] our Lord Jesus Christ the only thing
[2:05:18] that's on our mind is worshiping him
[2:05:21] amen throughout eternity that saved our
[2:05:24] soul gave us a Grace gave us the
[2:05:26] blessings of God Amen you see it's got
[2:05:28] to be all out of the way so we could
[2:05:30] turn our attention and focus upon our
[2:05:32] Lord Jesus Christ because it's the
[2:05:35] Rapture of the church now I know it
[2:05:37] would be easy for us to say one of these
[2:05:39] days this is going to happen one of
[2:05:41] these days these things are going to
[2:05:43] take place but do you know you're living
[2:05:44] in a moment right now where you are
[2:05:47] bumping into another dimension while
[2:05:49] you're sitting in the building this
[2:05:51] morning
[2:05:51] do you recognize there's another
[2:05:53] dimension that is running right current
[2:05:56] with this church this morning and once
[2:05:58] in a while you bump into that Dimension
[2:06:00] you bump into that anointing when
[2:06:03] brother Branham describes it amen I'm
[2:06:05] not going to read it I'll just preach it
[2:06:06] but when brother random describes it he
[2:06:08] says what is happening he says is the
[2:06:10] angels of the Lord have encamped about
[2:06:11] this building and they're creating the
[2:06:14] atmosphere that you are feeling he said
[2:06:17] that's why when you come in here you
[2:06:20] feel different than you did amen because
[2:06:22] you've come into the atmosphere of it
[2:06:24] and that atmosphere is the atmosphere at
[2:06:27] one of these mornings you're going to
[2:06:29] step into that atmosphere and it's not
[2:06:31] just going to heal you amen your body of
[2:06:34] cancer or Your Eyes Upon Us it's going
[2:06:36] to change you from the top of your head
[2:06:39] to the bottom of your feet it's an
[2:06:41] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost amen I
[2:06:44] don't know about y'all amen but I don't
[2:06:46] want no intellectual formal atmosphere I
[2:06:49] want to live in the place where angels
[2:06:51] are created eating and staring and
[2:06:53] moving and the power of God is sweeping
[2:06:56] back and forth
[2:06:57] [Applause]
[2:06:59] amen there's a ton of quotes brother
[2:07:02] Adam said we are living when time is
[2:07:04] blending into eternity again and again
[2:07:07] he says it we're living when time is
[2:07:09] Blended into eternity we are living
[2:07:12] where time Blends into eternity and he
[2:07:15] says listen that realm is not a Million
[2:07:18] Miles Away
[2:07:20] hey man you've heard brother bam say it
[2:07:22] he said how is it then that that angel
[2:07:24] cannot be here and in one second he's
[2:07:27] here
[2:07:29] he said if he was coming from out in the
[2:07:31] heaven somewhere he said some of those
[2:07:33] places are a million light years
[2:07:36] amen how many Earth years would it take
[2:07:39] for him to get here he had to start over
[2:07:41] there a hundred years ago to get here
[2:07:44] this morning but he appears and
[2:07:46] disappears and moves right through the
[2:07:48] church amen all this that you said
[2:07:50] preacher what are you saying I'm saying
[2:07:52] that's why amen that things can change
[2:07:54] so quickly you could be sitting here
[2:07:56] thinking well I'm not getting much or
[2:07:58] this ain't going to be a good day or
[2:08:00] this situation and all of a sudden one
[2:08:02] word it turns up you're inside amen
[2:08:05] turns your world over and all of a
[2:08:07] sudden you're setting in a revelation
[2:08:09] that God is dealing with you because
[2:08:11] it's a sudden change and the change of
[2:08:15] the body will come from that same
[2:08:17] atmosphere
[2:08:19] I'll tell you what when you start
[2:08:21] studying this and you see when you start
[2:08:23] seeing that this atmosphere begins to
[2:08:26] blend into this realm these Dimensions
[2:08:29] begin to bump together and it starts
[2:08:31] moving brother Brandon will tell it like
[2:08:33] this he'll say it's angels in the room
[2:08:35] now now I know we're coming under an
[2:08:39] extreme amount of criticism for worship
[2:08:42] yeah
[2:08:43] an extreme amount of criticism for
[2:08:45] worship and I'll tell you why it's
[2:08:48] because men don't understand the
[2:08:50] atmosphere
[2:08:52] they just don't understand
[2:08:54] if they did they wouldn't criticize it
[2:08:56] because they would know that's what it
[2:08:57] takes for birth
[2:08:58] that's what it takes to bring life
[2:09:00] that's what it takes to break Spirits
[2:09:03] that's what it that's what it takes is
[2:09:05] an atmosphere from the spirit of God
[2:09:08] that creates those things now watch this
[2:09:10] because brother random begins to tell us
[2:09:12] this amen that these things are present
[2:09:15] right now
[2:09:17] in this building right now
[2:09:21] now if they're present here right now we
[2:09:24] need something to open to reveal to us
[2:09:26] so that we can possess what actually is
[2:09:30] in the room
[2:09:31] how many opportunities have we left lane
[2:09:35] how many how many times
[2:09:37] have we been in the service when the
[2:09:38] spirit of God and we miss that we miss
[2:09:40] that opportunity let me tell you let me
[2:09:42] tell you what happens
[2:09:43] the spirit of God to be moving now and
[2:09:46] uh maybe maybe if you're new or you're
[2:09:48] visiting or maybe if you're
[2:09:50] trying to impress people or being a
[2:09:52] party I remember when I was young went
[2:09:54] into a meet one time and man I was you
[2:09:56] know all these people and I I just don't
[2:09:59] heal Billy and I felt pretty embarrassed
[2:10:01] around all of them and especially if
[2:10:02] they ever figured out how I worshiped
[2:10:04] that's a crazy man I just sit in a
[2:10:07] meeting spirit of God goes by you know
[2:10:08] and I feel it boy
[2:10:10] man you just want to get up and shout
[2:10:12] you know and I just sat on it and the
[2:10:14] guy behind me goes to screaming
[2:10:18] and you knew right then
[2:10:20] that you missed the presence and let
[2:10:22] somebody else get it because you was
[2:10:24] just a little embarrassed
[2:10:26] or you would just look amen and it
[2:10:29] passed right over you see somebody then
[2:10:31] somebody says to you they said well what
[2:10:33] what does that what does that have to do
[2:10:35] with it that's just emotion but see
[2:10:37] there's an unseen Force creating that
[2:10:40] now if you were a Seer as brother
[2:10:42] Branham was brother Branham in the
[2:10:45] message God in Simplicity it's in
[2:10:46] Albuquerque the end of the meeting
[2:10:47] whether Ram is teaching on how to
[2:10:49] receive the Holy Ghost most of his
[2:10:51] sermons he closes in prayer lines in
[2:10:53] this one he's telling you how to receive
[2:10:55] the Holy Ghost about a 30-minute section
[2:10:57] and in the middle of that section hey
[2:10:59] man you'll hear him say there it is
[2:11:02] and people are going screaming I mean
[2:11:04] the power's dropping you can hear the
[2:11:06] congregation and he'll go there it is
[2:11:11] and then he'll turn around the demon
[2:11:13] shakarian and he'll watch a little woman
[2:11:15] and he'll watch her throw her hands up
[2:11:17] and brother bam you can hear him
[2:11:18] slightly on tape and he'll say demons
[2:11:20] did you see it did you see it and he
[2:11:22] says now I tried to point it to other
[2:11:23] demons just a moment ago that Pillar of
[2:11:25] Fire just came over this little girl
[2:11:26] right here and she throwed her hands up
[2:11:29] now say sometimes when you see that
[2:11:31] happen you see a little girl throw up
[2:11:33] her hands you'll say well is that real
[2:11:35] you know and the prophet of God said he
[2:11:38] she throwed up her hands because that
[2:11:39] pillar of light went over her now do you
[2:11:42] see what shamgar's got to fight because
[2:11:44] you're going to look at somebody else
[2:11:45] throw up their hands and you're going to
[2:11:46] see a hypocrite do it sometime and
[2:11:48] you're going to say well there's nothing
[2:11:49] in behind it and that's a devil of
[2:11:52] impersonation trying to rob you from the
[2:11:54] reality of what is really happening
[2:11:56] Satan is always trying to steal from the
[2:12:00] church
[2:12:01] listen I want to thank God for our young
[2:12:04] people in this generation amen I thank
[2:12:06] God for our generation that's coming up
[2:12:08] amen that learns how to worship and I I
[2:12:10] just want to give you thanks to some of
[2:12:12] you old Eagles teaching these young
[2:12:14] Eagles how to fly
[2:12:16] because that's sometimes really what
[2:12:17] they need they need to see Mama get up
[2:12:19] and shout and dance and I know people
[2:12:21] don't like that but it's true anyhow
[2:12:23] they need to see you shout The Pride off
[2:12:25] a little bit and Shout you remember
[2:12:26] people who shot the hairpins out I've
[2:12:28] seen them either I've seen them leave
[2:12:30] their shoes under the Altar and just
[2:12:32] shout back and forth how their hair fell
[2:12:34] down and the pins were laying on the
[2:12:36] floor amen my old grandma used to get to
[2:12:38] shout and she would she'd bounce up
[2:12:40] against a hot a hot wood stove and it
[2:12:42] would never burn her it wasn't something
[2:12:44] false it was reality amen but God showed
[2:12:48] it to me as a young child and I saw the
[2:12:51] reality and I saw the power of God and
[2:12:54] let me tell you this amen I got away
[2:12:56] from it but one day God got to calling
[2:12:58] me back to it and listen I remember my
[2:13:01] Heritage I remember the shouting people
[2:13:03] I come from the power of God that would
[2:13:06] flow to their lives and sometimes that's
[2:13:09] what our young people need to see they
[2:13:11] don't need to see just a perfect person
[2:13:13] living a perfect life but they need to
[2:13:15] see parents and mothers and have done
[2:13:18] wrong or said wrong and say honey I was
[2:13:20] wrong I'm sorry but I ain't gonna stay
[2:13:23] under this guilt my whole life I'm gonna
[2:13:25] say I'm sorry and then I'm gonna shout
[2:13:28] and I'm gonna dance and I'm going to
[2:13:30] praise God because I'm under the blood
[2:13:33] [Applause]
[2:13:36] man ain't nobody perfect but the blood
[2:13:39] covers the heart of a man if he ever
[2:13:42] says God I'm sorry
[2:13:47] those Dimensions try to come together
[2:13:49] they're coming together on you
[2:13:52] you are the place that God is breaking
[2:13:55] out in this generation
[2:13:57] amen we got we got sister Ella with us
[2:13:59] tonight this morning God bless sister
[2:14:01] Ella amen she sits on my my left at home
[2:14:04] she's she's one of my spiritual
[2:14:06] cheerleaders amen if things get a little
[2:14:08] tough I just look at Ella she's right
[2:14:10] with me come on preach it by the way

[2:14:14] the rest of them's doing but I come to
[2:14:16] have church I pray that everybody that
[2:14:18] comes to the house of God comes in the
[2:14:20] spirit of Hell come and put your hands
[2:14:22] up and say I don't have no problems I'm
[2:14:25] not seeing no problem I'm just looking
[2:14:27] to worship God and praise God and get
[2:14:30] the Revival in my life until the Holy
[2:14:32] Ghost can move in every heart
[2:14:36] you all know I'm telling you the truth
[2:14:38] It's Shouting Time Amen in the Church of
[2:14:40] the Living God the message of the hours
[2:14:42] receive the message of change
[2:14:46] oh if we were looking for something
[2:14:48] maybe one thing but when you realize
[2:14:50] what you're in possession of and what
[2:14:52] God has revealed to you he's showing you
[2:14:55] that that other dimension is right here
[2:14:58] in this dimension
[2:15:01] somebody said well I tell you why amen I
[2:15:03] I I don't understand how it's not here
[2:15:06] and not somewhere else
[2:15:08] this is just a building folks
[2:15:10] that's all this is it's just a building
[2:15:13] this is only a building that somebody
[2:15:15] put up here amen but what makes it
[2:15:18] become the atmosphere is every one of
[2:15:21] you are creators
[2:15:22] and when you come into the house of God
[2:15:24] and you begin to let everything else go
[2:15:27] amen I told I told our church I'll brag
[2:15:29] on True Word the other day I said I'll
[2:15:31] tell you what I found out this brother
[2:15:32] Matt no matter what that church is going
[2:15:34] through they're ready to have church it
[2:15:37] don't matter I've seen them lay off we
[2:15:38] went through some great struggles we
[2:15:40] lost Rachel and Charlie amen we've lost
[2:15:42] other people sudden deaths and tragedies
[2:15:44] and situations they were ready to have
[2:15:46] church and you know I found the kindred
[2:15:48] spirit right here at Full Gospel
[2:15:50] Lighthouse I found that this this place
[2:15:52] that you know how to set aside the
[2:15:55] problems to have church let the
[2:15:57] atmosphere of God come upon amen listen
[2:16:00] our young people does not need to
[2:16:02] inherit the problems of other
[2:16:04] Generations we do not need to set them
[2:16:07] down and tell them all the problems
[2:16:10] we don't need to some of you have told
[2:16:13] your children things they should have
[2:16:15] never knew and they never would have
[2:16:17] knew it had you not told them I think
[2:16:19] it's time to quit telling tales and
[2:16:21] start telling promises and telling the
[2:16:23] word of God start telling the positive
[2:16:25] things it's a changing time amen I don't
[2:16:29] have time to cover all the problems and
[2:16:31] all the situations
[2:16:35] my dad one time had an old boy help me
[2:16:37] with a boat but brother Rona had her boy
[2:16:39] helped me a boat and I liked the guy he
[2:16:41] was a nice guy the older man I went home
[2:16:43] told my dad about it and dad said to me
[2:16:45] he said son he said now that guy he said
[2:16:48] he was in the Masons with your grandpa
[2:16:49] and he said he done him dirty on he
[2:16:52] didn't even die he done him dirty on a
[2:16:54] car deal

[2:16:57] right then my grandpa been dead I was
[2:17:00] three-year-old when he died
[2:17:01] I got me an attitude right then I
[2:17:04] wouldn't even go back down to that guy's
[2:17:05] place I didn't have him hey I needed him
[2:17:08] I didn't have him do anything else for
[2:17:09] me I wouldn't even drive down his
[2:17:11] driveway no more
[2:17:13] and one day I was talking to Dad he said
[2:17:15] what'd you say that guy's name was and I
[2:17:16] told him again he said no that's the
[2:17:18] wrong guy he said it was that other guy
[2:17:22] and I was so offended for my dead
[2:17:25] grandpa I didn't even want to talk to
[2:17:27] that man listen amen don't get offended
[2:17:30] for other people's problems and whatever
[2:17:31] somebody else done to somebody else I
[2:17:34] tell you it's time to set aside every
[2:17:37] situation and get ready for the change
[2:17:40] get ready for the change get ready for
[2:17:43] the atmosphere of God to break out in
[2:17:45] the church you got what you already need
[2:17:47] and you can create an atmosphere right
[2:17:49] here in this building amen we're dead
[2:17:51] Limbs and come back upon lies and hearts
[2:17:54] begin to change listen I tell you you
[2:17:56] can create it I promise you can create
[2:17:59] it
[2:18:00] he said preacher I tell you what at my
[2:18:01] house is pretty bad do you know you can
[2:18:03] build it
[2:18:04] all the stories you read brother bam
[2:18:06] telling Aaron's Rod how many ever heard
[2:18:08] it
[2:18:09] he talks about an old stick taken off of
[2:18:11] a tree and taken into the atmosphere of
[2:18:13] the holies of holies and it budded
[2:18:15] overnight
[2:18:16] do you know that atmosphere that budded
[2:18:18] that stick brother Brown said it
[2:18:20] represented Humanity in the presence of
[2:18:22] God he said you come off of The Stick of
[2:18:25] humanity and you were dried up and dead
[2:18:27] but when you come in the presence of God
[2:18:29] it brought life again
[2:18:31] that place that Moses took the Stick of
[2:18:34] Aaron into he built it
[2:18:38] he built it
[2:18:40] all that Supernatural with a pillar of
[2:18:43] fire and the light Moses built that
[2:18:46] place
[2:18:47] and he built it so that God could meet
[2:18:49] with man and that same atmosphere is
[2:18:53] still available in the house of God not
[2:18:55] because of the church but because the
[2:18:57] people build the atmosphere where God
[2:19:00] comes in and deals with man
[2:19:04] now I don't know of a better story in
[2:19:06] the Bible to give this example I'm out
[2:19:07] of time so I'm just going to preach to
[2:19:08] you here and close but I'll tell you
[2:19:10] this I don't know of a better example in
[2:19:11] story in the Bible than jerivus daughter
[2:19:15] I don't know of a better example in
[2:19:17] story When jariris sin after the Lord he
[2:19:20] went and got him and said come to my
[2:19:22] house right come to my house and Jesus
[2:19:25] said I'll come now he's coming
[2:19:28] just like he promised Through the Ages
[2:19:30] I'm coming
[2:19:31] but but geriver's daughter died before
[2:19:34] he ever got there
[2:19:35] right and and somebody come and said
[2:19:38] don't bother the master she's already
[2:19:40] dead and he said the woman she's not
[2:19:43] dead
[2:19:44] the girl's not dead she sleeps
[2:19:48] he started breaking out revelation
[2:19:51] and the Bible tells us
[2:19:53] amen that when he got down to the house
[2:19:55] you know what when he announced that she
[2:19:57] was sleeping she wasn't dead the Bible
[2:19:58] said they scorned him
[2:20:01] they laughed at him for his revelation

[2:20:22] unbeliever

[2:20:29] Peter James and John brother bam said he
[2:20:32] took in the room faith hope and charity
[2:20:36] he exchanged critics and unbelievers

[2:20:45] faith charity and brothers said anywhere
[2:20:47] that you can take in charity hope and
[2:20:49] love Faith charity and hope he said
[2:20:51] where you can take them in what he done
[2:20:53] is he changed the atmosphere in
[2:20:56] gerivers's house
[2:20:58] he changed the atmosphere in jeriver's
[2:21:01] house and it comes he said preacher what
[2:21:04] are you talking about I'm talking about
[2:21:05] William Branham walking into his house
[2:21:07] one day and his wife was all tore up
[2:21:09] because of her motherhood duties
[2:21:13] and he didn't get on to her
[2:21:16] he walked over to her
[2:21:19] and put his hand on her
[2:21:21] and begin to pray for him brother man
[2:21:23] said what is I doing
[2:21:25] I changed
[2:21:27] the atmosphere
[2:21:31] Moses did it
[2:21:33] Jesus did it brother Brandon did it
[2:21:36] you can do it
[2:21:40] in your home
[2:21:42] you can change the atmosphere
[2:21:46] you can change how you're living
[2:21:48] you can change how you talk to your wife
[2:21:50] you can change how you talk to your
[2:21:52] children a wife can change how she talks
[2:21:54] to the husband and they can make an
[2:21:56] atmosphere bring that atmosphere right
[2:21:59] into that house
[2:22:00] we're a body change
[2:22:04] take place in your living room
[2:22:09] instead of an old television taking
[2:22:11] preeminence over your living room the
[2:22:14] spirit of the Living God
[2:22:16] moves through the house with claiming
[2:22:19] authority over that 14 year old girl's
[2:22:21] body and it begins to claim her mind
[2:22:24] thinking on the Promises of God begins
[2:22:26] to roam through the house with a claim
[2:22:29] and anointing changing hearts and
[2:22:30] changing Minds because you let something
[2:22:33] in the house that could change things
[2:22:34] one of the greatest conversions I ever
[2:22:37] saw personally in my life was Matt
[2:22:39] morse's wife
[2:22:41] she's a she's a tremendous young lady
[2:22:43] but but she was in the world she was
[2:22:45] having trouble I was on the road she
[2:22:47] called and said by the way Matt called
[2:22:49] me said when you're going to come home I
[2:22:51] said I'll be home in a couple days he
[2:22:52] said Sarah wants to see you and and she
[2:22:55] knew she knew in her heart that I had a
[2:22:57] great burden to see her saved but she
[2:23:00] was living the wrong kind of life
[2:23:02] and she met me at the house one night
[2:23:03] when I come off of the road and she's
[2:23:05] talked to me a little while and there
[2:23:06] were some issues and things needed to be
[2:23:08] corrected and things and she looked
[2:23:10] right at me and she said do I have to
[2:23:12] correct them I said you'll either
[2:23:13] correct them or you'll never be right
[2:23:15] with God
[2:23:17] and when she looked at me she said I'll
[2:23:19] do it right now
[2:23:20] and when that girl corrected this
[2:23:22] situation
[2:23:23] she came back in there and she said I'm
[2:23:25] ready now
[2:23:28] we got down on the floor of my living
[2:23:30] room
[2:23:32] and when I moved out of that house there
[2:23:34] was still spots
[2:23:35] where that girl had cried her way to
[2:23:38] Christ
[2:23:40] that my wife kept an atmosphere in my
[2:23:43] home
[2:23:45] that a conversion could take place in
[2:23:47] the living room
[2:23:51] your home doesn't have to be that way
[2:23:54] it can have an atmosphere
[2:23:57] where the power of God can just drop you
[2:23:59] in any moment and change things
[2:24:02] situations could change lives could
[2:24:04] change you said by the way I'm having
[2:24:05] these great issues I'm sorry brother Ron
[2:24:07] I mean I'm having these great issues and
[2:24:09] these great situations we need marriage
[2:24:11] counseling we need this no you need
[2:24:13] atmosphere
[2:24:17] you need to be so aware of the
[2:24:18] atmosphere that you quit putting those
[2:24:20] mean words into it
[2:24:23] until you quit talking to one another in
[2:24:26] that tone
[2:24:27] and let that atmosphere come that
[2:24:30] sweetens hearts Sweden's lives and
[2:24:33] changes
[2:24:35] do you see what is see what is happening
[2:24:37] is God
[2:24:38] is getting ready to change some people
[2:24:41] he's getting ready to change some lives
[2:24:43] and hearts and it begins with your
[2:24:45] atmosphere where you live
[2:24:48] and I I believe it this morning amen I
[2:24:51] believe can our musicians come I believe
[2:24:53] there's atmosphere
[2:24:56] that is created
[2:25:00] but I wouldn't know that if it hadn't
[2:25:02] been revealed in this generation
[2:25:06] William Branham could walk into a
[2:25:08] Coliseum
[2:25:10] where they didn't even have church
[2:25:12] and within a few nights
[2:25:15] he would have such a reverence in that
[2:25:17] building to the angel of the Lord could
[2:25:18] come right into place
[2:25:24] yeah I know you've heard I know you've
[2:25:26] heard us talk about it
[2:25:28] we've heard talking about sitting in my
[2:25:29] living room table and brother Ron just
[2:25:31] start talking about the Lord and his
[2:25:33] encounters and the spirit of God Brother
[2:25:35] Ray asked actually
[2:25:37] the presence of God just came so so
[2:25:39] powerfully
[2:25:41] young young children started showing
[2:25:43] reverence and people began to sing and
[2:25:48] because it was an atmosphere
[2:25:52] we didn't have to go to church
[2:25:56] we didn't have to go find a holy man
[2:25:58] somewhere
[2:26:00] we didn't start talking about the Lord
[2:26:03] the next thing you know there was such
[2:26:05] an anointing
[2:26:07] such a presence
[2:26:08] [Music]
[2:26:10] that anointing in this building
[2:26:14] it's here right now
[2:26:17] I started talking about them homes and I
[2:26:19] felt I felt a change in the room
[2:26:23] and I I don't I don't try to be here
[2:26:26] I don't know there's gifted men like
[2:26:28] that I'm probably not that one but I but
[2:26:30] you can feel that shift
[2:26:33] you pick you picked that up you know
[2:26:35] just in the preaching and you realize
[2:26:37] the holy spirit's dealing with something
[2:26:38] right there
[2:26:41] dealing with a heart right there
[2:26:44] see
[2:26:47] take your mind out of that Facebook
[2:26:50] not preaching against Facebook
[2:26:53] but it's consuming you
[2:26:57] who would have ever knew that Fox News
[2:26:59] and CNN would be the cause of the
[2:27:01] downfall many good men
[2:27:03] because they start focusing on the
[2:27:06] negative
[2:27:07] quit praying
[2:27:09] they go out here in a world full of
[2:27:11] Jezebels working every day and they get
[2:27:12] their mind off of the Lord they get
[2:27:14] their mind off of God
[2:27:16] it's the news and politics and
[2:27:18] presidents and religion and ideas of man
[2:27:20] the next thing you know they're in a
[2:27:22] place that's so dark
[2:27:25] then they take a lovely little wife that
[2:27:27] serves them at home and loves them
[2:27:32] next thing you know she's ugly to you
[2:27:36] eyes on something Jezebel somewhere that
[2:27:39] somebody's put thirty thousand dollars
[2:27:41] in to make her look like that
[2:27:47] but you know what's real
[2:27:50] what's real
[2:27:51] Christian woman
[2:27:54] what's real is a real Godly mother a
[2:27:57] real Godly that's what's real
[2:28:00] that's that's what will stay with you
[2:28:05] that's what will be there
[2:28:07] when everything else fails
[2:28:09] [Music]
[2:28:11] but it's a it's a turn
[2:28:13] I'm sorry I know this is Mother's Day
[2:28:17] but it's a turning of the atmosphere
[2:28:19] it's going to change bodies
[2:28:22] [Music]
[2:28:25] change that life
[2:28:28] if you just change the focus of it
[2:28:30] [Music]
[2:28:32] I believe we could do that right now
[2:28:33] don't you
[2:28:36] I believe we could do it now can we just
[2:28:38] close our eyes maybe let's just bow our
[2:28:39] hearts
[2:28:43] maybe the Lord's speaking to you today
[2:28:45] we know this change is coming upon our
[2:28:48] bodies but as this blending begins to
