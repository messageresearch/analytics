[35:41] things are starting to grow and now i
[35:44] would grow mine but i'm an apache
[35:51] and so i i'll just stick with the
[35:53] mustache and so
[35:56] amen amen i had a mustache since i was
[35:58] 18 years old and so
[36:00] i
[36:01] i cut it off and
[36:03] it was off for a bit and sister nancy
[36:05] said he needs to put that back on so
[36:09] amen god bless you sister nancy
[36:13] amen then when i was burning the fire it
[36:15] was burnt off and brother tim pruitt
[36:16] told me i need to put it back on so
[36:19] amen god bless you if you'll turn with
[36:20] me in your scriptures again this morning
[36:22] i'd like to turn with genesis chapter 22
[36:28] and i'd like to continue where we are
[36:31] we're we're at part three now
[36:33] and uh
[36:34] destined to fulfill
[36:36] and we are
[36:38] destined to fulfill
[36:40] i i understand in every age they were
[36:43] destined to fulfill a part
[36:46] but we're destined to fulfill if you
[36:48] remember brother branham said
[36:50] if a man was allowed to pick and i'm
[36:53] just going to paraphrase here to pick
[36:55] what age that he would want to live in
[36:57] prophet if he would pick what age that
[36:59] he would have liked to have been a part
[37:01] of
[37:02] they would have picked this age
[37:05] and so the seat that you're sitting in
[37:07] is a very coveted seat
[37:10] because the saints that are waiting on
[37:12] us on the other side they they went
[37:14] through different things and they lived
[37:16] out their parts and they lived out their
[37:18] lives but they would have loved to lived
[37:20] in this age
[37:23] because it's in this age we'll see the
[37:26] resurrection
[37:28] and it's in this age that we'll see the
[37:30] rapture
[37:32] and
[37:33] one of our devotions this morning said
[37:36] don't be discouraged about everything
[37:38] that you see around you
[37:40] there's good news
[37:42] he's coming
[37:44] hallelujah so i got good news to
[37:46] announce to you
[37:48] he's coming
[37:50] everything you see here is temporary
[37:53] he's coming
[37:55] amen genesis 22 and verse 8
[37:59] and abraham said my son god will provide
[38:03] himself a lamb for a burnt offering
[38:06] and so they went
[38:09] both of them
[38:10] together
[38:13] and they came to the place which god had
[38:16] told him of and abraham built an altar
[38:19] there and laid the wood in order and
[38:22] bound isaac his son
[38:24] and laid him on the altar upon the wood
[38:27] and abraham stretched forth his hand and
[38:30] took the knife to slay his son
[38:34] and the angel of the lord called unto
[38:37] him out of the heaven and said abraham
[38:40] abraham
[38:42] and he said
[38:43] here am i
[38:44] and he said lay not thy hand upon the
[38:47] lad neither do thou anything unto him
[38:51] for
[38:52] now i know that thou fierce god
[38:56] sin thou hast not withheld thy son
[38:59] thine only son
[39:02] from me
[39:03] and abraham lifted up his eyes and
[39:05] looked and beho and behold and beheld a
[39:08] ram caught in the thicket by his thorns
[39:12] and abraham went and took the lamb and
[39:14] offered him up for a burnt offering
[39:17] in the stead of his son
[39:19] and abraham called the place
[39:22] jehovah jireh
[39:24] and as it was said to this day in the
[39:26] mount of the lord it shall be seen
[39:30] and the angel of the lord called unto
[39:32] abraham out of heaven the second time
[39:35] and said by myself i have sworn
[39:39] saith the lord for because
[39:42] thou has not has done this thing and has
[39:45] not withheld thy son thine only son
[39:48] that in blessing i will bless thee
[39:52] and in multiplying i will multiply thy
[39:55] seed as the stars of the heaven and as
[39:59] the sand which is upon the seashore
[40:02] and thy seed shall possess the gates of
[40:05] their enemy
[40:06] and in thy seed shall all nations of the
[40:10] earth be blessed
[40:11] because thou has obeyed
[40:14] my voice
[40:16] verse 17 i'd like to of you to put your
[40:18] finger on it i want you to read it with
[40:20] me again
[40:22] that in blessing i will bless thee and
[40:25] in multiplying i will multiply thy seed
[40:29] as the stars of the heaven and as the
[40:32] sand that which is upon the seashore
[40:36] and thy seed shall possess the gate of
[40:39] his enemy
[40:41] it's talking about you
[40:44] and i want you to remember who's talking
[40:46] god
[40:49] he had you in his mind when abraham was
[40:51] on that mountain
[40:53] amen let's just pray lord jesus
[40:56] you see the needs that are among us even
[40:58] now father
[41:00] lord i ask you that you would touch our
[41:01] hearts
[41:02] lord anoint this vessel as we speak the
[41:05] word of life
[41:06] i pray that you bring us strength father
[41:09] you know that i need strength in my body
[41:11] this morning and lord you're the
[41:13] sustainer
[41:15] you're preserver of my life
[41:17] and lord i ask you that you would touch
[41:19] them the many needs that have came in
[41:21] brother robert douglas that said very
[41:23] sick this morning and lord the many that
[41:25] are out here i remember brother kahn
[41:28] that caught that that that writes me
[41:30] every week and his sister her name i
[41:33] believe is grace
[41:35] lord that she has a brain tumor
[41:37] and lord i just asked you that you'd
[41:39] send your word and lord
[41:41] lord send your word and heal

[41:46] we pray amen and amen and amen god bless
[41:49] you you may be seated
[41:52] amen
[41:54] amen
[42:00] i i love how our prophet puts this and i
[42:02] just want to read it and i just want you
[42:05] just to absorb it
[42:08] and he's speaking he says it and he
[42:10] showed him on a hillside
[42:13] where those pieces represented
[42:16] now any bible scholar here knows that
[42:19] each one of those was a clean animal
[42:22] that represented the sacrifice of jesus
[42:24] christ
[42:26] he was a ram
[42:28] he was a heifer that was made made the
[42:31] waters of separation when you had waters
[42:34] of separations through
[42:36] now
[42:37] we have a washing by the water of the
[42:39] word of the separation from sin
[42:42] and he said through the word
[42:45] through believing
[42:47] he said the pigeon and the eternal love
[42:49] was the divine healing and all was in
[42:52] christ
[42:54] and there
[42:55] god showed abram what he was doing going
[42:58] to do that through the seed of isaac he
[43:01] would bring forth his only begotten son
[43:05] christ was slain yonder between heavens
[43:08] and earth
[43:10] and when the sun went down in the
[43:12] blackness over the earth and there he
[43:14] tore him apart
[43:16] he said pulled his soul out of him
[43:19] and he rode a covenant with the families
[43:22] of the earth
[43:25] here's a man with a with a very low
[43:28] education but he's speaking
[43:31] eternal poetic
[43:32] justice if we could
[43:35] i want to just read it he said christ
[43:38] was slaying yonder between heavens and
[43:40] earth
[43:42] when the sun went down the blackness
[43:45] over the earth and there he tore him
[43:47] apart
[43:49] and god pulled his soul out of him and
[43:52] wrote a covenant with the families of
[43:54] the earth
[43:55] i'm one of them
[43:58] i identify myself as one of them brother
[44:00] mike
[44:03] when that precious
[44:05] unadulterated blood of almighty god
[44:09] dripping from emmanuel's veins
[44:11] he tore that soul out of him
[44:14] and he says my my
[44:16] he said why thou why hast thou forsaken
[44:19] me
[44:22] he says
[44:25] forgive me
[44:26] he says my god my god why hast thou
[44:29] forsaken me
[44:31] his face was full of mockery and spit
[44:34] a crown of cruelty mockery pulled down
[44:37] over his brow and his nails drove in the
[44:40] roman spikes
[44:43] his back riven until his ribs showed
[44:46] through
[44:47] swinging on a cross screaming
[44:49] dying a sinner's death the sin of the
[44:52] world was upon him
[44:54] and there was god riven his side tore
[44:58] his soul out of him and when he said
[45:00] into my hands i commit my spirit
[45:03] and he dropped his head and the
[45:06] and the whole earth shook
[45:09] and belched out its rocks
[45:12] think about those statements
[45:14] the whole earth shock
[45:18] there it is
[45:19] there's god's fulfillment
[45:22] there's god's fulfilling
[45:25] of it all
[45:27] he quotes the quote
[45:29] mid-rendering rocks and darkening skies
[45:32] my savior bled
[45:34] his bowed his head and died
[45:37] the opening veiled the way
[45:39] to heaven's joys and endless days
[45:42] oh calvary old calvary
[45:45] jesus bled and died for me
[45:48] then he tore his soul out of his own son
[45:50] and separated a covenant
[45:53] throwed the body into the ground
[45:55] and it laid there for three days and
[45:57] nights
[45:59] rose up for it was not possible that my
[46:04] holy one should seek eruption
[46:08] are you with me
[46:09] that it might be fulfilled
[46:12] that it might be fulfilled
[46:14] are you with me now
[46:16] that even our lives might be fulfilled
[46:19] in him
[46:21] are you with me we were the reason
[46:26] we were the reason never let it get past
[46:28] you we were the reason that he went to
[46:30] calvary's cross
[46:32] we were the reason that he went to be
[46:35] beat like no other man was ever beat
[46:39] all hell taken its vengeance out on him
[46:42] but remember by his stripes we are
[46:45] healed today
[46:48] we have a covenant with god
[46:50] not a covenant with man not a covenant
[46:53] with a president but a covenant with god
[46:56] by his stripes
[46:59] every devil in hell is defeated
[47:01] every sickness is defeated
[47:04] by his stripes
[47:09] that's greater than any union contract
[47:12] that's greater than any government
[47:14] between peace treaties in geneva that's
[47:17] a covenant with god
[47:19] a covenant between heaven and hell
[47:22] and it's for his children
[47:26] hallelujah
[47:29] god was fulfilling his own word
[47:33] are you with me now he was a kind of god
[47:36] that he would fulfill his own word he's
[47:38] not just expecting you to fulfill it
[47:41] but he
[47:42] fulfilled his own word
[47:45] in a prepared body
[47:47] in a prepared vessel
[47:50] now you are also that kind of prepared
[47:52] body
[47:54] a prepared temple that god wants to live
[47:57] in
[47:58] and he so prepares you until he
[48:01] he begins to deal with your life
[48:04] and you repent of your sins
[48:06] no i'm not turning up over a new leaf or
[48:09] changing a changing of the way that you
[48:11] do things like you do your diet
[48:16] but you get washed by the blood of jesus
[48:19] christ
[48:20] you truly repent to never go back again
[48:24] now let me just say this you many people
[48:26] are sorry but they keep going back
[48:29] but if you truly repent
[48:32] you never return back to that ever again
[48:37] many people say well i can't get rid of
[48:39] this habit or that habit it's because
[48:42] you're still in love with it you'll
[48:44] never get rid of something that you're
[48:45] still in love but if you ever come to a
[48:48] spot in your life that you realize
[48:51] that's your enemy
[48:52] [Applause]
[48:57] that's your enemy and it's destroying
[48:59] you you get rid of it
[49:07] the scripture says in hebrews chapter 11
[49:11] now faith is the substance of things
[49:13] hoped for
[49:14] the evidence of things not seen
[49:17] for by it
[49:19] the elders obtained a good report
[49:22] every one of them
[49:24] were destined to fulfill their part
[49:27] and listen many times they they
[49:30] absolutely had to walk by the revelation
[49:32] of faith
[49:34] they didn't have a book about themselves
[49:36] but they had to trust god
[49:39] now watch this
[49:40] through faith we understand that the
[49:42] worlds were framed by the word of god
[49:45] so that the things which were seen
[49:48] were not made of things which do appear
[49:51] understand there's a principle to it
[49:54] time
[49:55] intercepts intercepts with prophecy
[50:01] the word circles the earth for hundreds
[50:03] of years
[50:04] and then there comes a day to where that
[50:07] prophecy has to be fulfilled
[50:10] now think about for 2000 years people
[50:14] have been looking for the coming of the
[50:16] lord
[50:18] but because your name was in the book
[50:25] because your name was in the book
[50:28] and you had to be displayed on the earth
[50:30] and expressed
[50:32] martin luther would have loved to sing
[50:34] the rapture
[50:36] john wesley would have loved to sing the
[50:38] rapture but because your name was in the
[50:41] book
[50:43] god would not close the door and say a
[50:45] lot and i have no more
[50:47] but god allowed time to evolve
[50:52] let me just say the rapture rapture's
[50:53] absolutely on time
[50:57] it'll absolutely be on time oh i'm
[50:59] looking for the expectation of the
[51:01] rapture that should be in our heart
[51:04] wherefore comfort one another with these
[51:06] words but there will come a day when
[51:09] time and prophecy will intercept
[51:14] the word becomes reality
[51:17] we just spoke it a couple of days ago or
[51:19] it just seemed like a couple days ago
[51:21] here what a service it'll be
[51:24] when our loved ones are standing in this
[51:26] building
[51:30] witnesses from the other side
[51:33] standing here with us we won't have to
[51:37] preach
[51:38] we'll rejoice
[51:40] can you imagine the stage being filled
[51:42] with the musicians that have went on
[51:44] before
[51:46] can you imagine this stage with brother
[51:48] homer in a new body
[51:56] time will intercept with prophecy
[52:00] it's not just some illusion of hollywood
[52:02] or some or somewhere another that is
[52:05] going to be an hour that's going to
[52:08] happen
[52:09] we must press forward regardless of
[52:12] who's president regardless of the
[52:14] economic conditions regardless of what's
[52:17] going on in the world we must keep our
[52:20] focus on the fulfillment of the word of
[52:23] the hour
[52:25] that's our focus today
[52:35] brother man said
[52:36] these who are the royal seed
[52:40] are the elect of god are the
[52:42] predestinated
[52:43] the foreknown of god
[52:45] we're in the mind of god and his
[52:47] thoughts
[52:48] and very plain language in the true
[52:50] bride of christ was in the mind of god
[52:53] eternally
[52:55] though not expressed until they came
[52:57] forth in a designed designated
[53:00] decreed season
[53:03] as each member came forth it's expressed
[53:06] and it took its place in the body
[53:11] that's the bride is the literal
[53:14] spoken word seed
[53:17] bride
[53:21] now i i the reason i read that quote
[53:23] because it's so powerful we get so
[53:25] excited about squirrels being spoken
[53:31] we get so excited about squirrels coming
[53:34] into existence
[53:36] when there was no squirrels
[53:38] we get so excited about storms being
[53:41] held back
[53:43] but do you know that just as much as
[53:46] squirrels
[53:48] earth
[53:49] storms
[53:50] sun moon and stars god has watched over
[53:53] you
[53:56] in your designated season
[54:00] are you now you're expressed in this
[54:03] body
[54:04] you couldn't gather yourself here he
[54:06] gathered you
[54:08] it was like a great magnet that gathered
[54:11] you to the word
[54:13] and when you heard it
[54:16] it was like nothing you ever heard
[54:18] before
[54:24] hallelujah
[54:26] and it was life
[54:29] it was just life
[54:31] maybe someone sitting beside if you
[54:33] heard it didn't mean anything to him
[54:36] absolutely didn't mean anything to him
[54:41] but it meant something to you
[54:44] because god placed something in you
[54:50] what's the difference predestination
[54:54] it's not a dirty word
[54:57] it's not a dirty word it's
[54:58] predestination that doesn't mean
[55:01] fatalism
[55:02] that
[55:03] predestinations god thought of you
[55:05] before the foundation of the world and
[55:07] if you ever were in his mind
[55:15] you still are
[55:18] i just speak to a lady the other day
[55:21] in a service in ohio
[55:23] and she was sitting there and her
[55:25] husband was speaking to brother branham
[55:27] on the phone and he says
[55:29] brother brother branham would you like
[55:30] to tell her
[55:32] tell her happy birthday he said i sure
[55:34] would
[55:35] so brother branham got on the phone with
[55:37] her and he said
[55:38] he called her by name and i'm not going
[55:40] to do that today but he called her by
[55:41] name and he says
[55:44] i think i could give you a really nice
[55:46] birthday present he said i saw you there
[55:53] [Music]
[55:55] that makes the rest of your trials in
[55:57] life very very uh
[56:00] seem a whole lot easier kind of puts a
[56:02] little air under your wings doing it
[56:06] hallelujah
[56:08] you know i i've had several to to to
[56:11] write me and tell me that they had
[56:13] dreams
[56:14] and it would be dreams of seeing others
[56:16] from that other side
[56:19] and
[56:20] and they would send a message to me
[56:23] brother ron you're well thought of there
[56:27] that makes the storm a little be a
[56:29] little bit better
[56:32] hallelujah
[56:34] hallelujah
[56:35] don't you understand just now
[56:38] where you say well that's just a little
[56:40] far-fetched brother ron
[56:42] but i'm just telling you i'm i'm i'm
[56:45] destined
[56:48] this journey is from point a to point b
[56:52] are you with me and my focus there may
[56:53] be a lot of curves along the road but my
[56:55] focus is on the in journey
[56:58] and i'm trying to tell you you're there
[57:00] too
[57:01] when brother branham went beyond the
[57:02] curtain of time
[57:06] are they all branhams he said no they're
[57:08] your converts
[57:10] and he says well i preached what paul
[57:12] preached
[57:13] i preached what peter preached
[57:16] and we screamed we're resting on that
[57:19] [Music]
[57:21] hallelujah
[57:28] i
[57:29] i just read to you about abraham abraham
[57:34] literally is mentioned in almost every
[57:36] chapter of the bible
[57:39] every book in the bible let me say it
[57:41] like that
[57:42] so i don't go too far
[57:44] but there are other people
[57:48] that live an entire life
[57:51] and maybe one out of a million
[57:53] their name gets called in the scriptures
[57:57] let me just share a couple with you in
[58:00] genesis chapter 3 and verse 31
[58:05] and after him
[58:07] was shamgar
[58:10] the son of aid
[58:12] which slew of the fist philistines
[58:16] 600 men
[58:17] with an ox goat
[58:19] which is a six foot
[58:21] and he also delivered
[58:24] israel
[58:28] of all the bible his name is mentioned
[58:30] in there
[58:32] in revelations chapter 2 and verse 13.
[58:36] and i know thy works
[58:38] what a horrible age this was
[58:40] and where thou dwellest
[58:42] even where satan's seed is
[58:46] and thou
[58:47] hold us fast my name and has not denied
[58:51] the faith
[58:52] even in those days wherein antipas
[58:56] was my faithful martyr
[59:00] who was slain among you
[59:03] where's satan dwelleth i'd like for hell
[59:06] to listen to that today
[59:08] right in the middle of hell's sink in
[59:11] the stronghold
[59:12] god had a believer in that age
[59:16] that was faithful and would not deny
[59:20] it
[59:23] hallelujah
[59:25] let me just say i i felt supercharged
[59:28] this morning as i begin to think about
[59:30] i'm standing and preaching to the most
[59:32] powerful people on the earth
[59:34] [Music]
[59:35] living in the darkest age that there's
[59:37] ever been
[59:39] brother branham himself could not look
[59:41] past 77 because it was so dark
[59:45] we've become accustomed with sodom's
[59:47] conditions and sodom's age and the world
[59:50] falling apart but in the midst of all of
[59:53] it there's a bride around the world
[59:57] that refuses to give up
[59:59] refuses to turn back
[1:00:02] she is identified with this message and
[1:00:05] she's not ashamed of it
[1:00:18] numbers chapter 14 and verse 24.
[1:00:25] but my faithful servant caleb
[1:00:28] i'd like for my name to be mentioned
[1:00:30] there
[1:00:34] i'd like for god to say
[1:00:36] ron spencer was faithful
[1:00:39] not only doing this by example i'm not
[1:00:41] puffing myself up or i'm not trying to
[1:00:43] get you to look at me i'm trying to get
[1:00:45] you to look at him
[1:00:46] but i want you to put your name there
[1:00:49] my faithful servant
[1:00:52] put your name right there
[1:00:54] my faithful servant
[1:00:58] oh you are to be louder than that
[1:01:00] my faithful servant
[1:01:05] because he hath another spirit with him
[1:01:08] when everybody else is saying the giants
[1:01:10] are too big we can't go
[1:01:13] he was standing there said we're more
[1:01:15] than able
[1:01:18] we're possessors of the land he was
[1:01:21] reaching back to abraham's seat
[1:01:24] abraham isaac jacob the children of
[1:01:28] israel
[1:01:29] i'm one of them
[1:01:33] i identify myself as one of them
[1:01:40] listen if a gentile can identify himself
[1:01:42] as one of them we ought to be able to
[1:01:44] stand and say i'm one of them like never
[1:01:46] before
[1:01:49] romans paul says it like this i beseech
[1:01:51] you therefore brethren romans 12 and 1 i
[1:01:54] beseech you therefore brethren by the
[1:01:56] mercies of god that you present your
[1:01:58] bodies a living sacrifice
[1:02:01] holy and acceptable unto god which is a
[1:02:04] reasonable service and be not conformed
[1:02:07] to this world but be you transformed by
[1:02:09] the renewing of your mind that you may
[1:02:11] prove
[1:02:13] what is good
[1:02:14] and acceptable
[1:02:16] and perfect
[1:02:18] will of god god will have people in
[1:02:21] every generation
[1:02:25] that will be the banner
[1:02:28] of what his expectation is
[1:02:36] now
[1:02:37] let me just be real clear
[1:02:40] we are the final voice
[1:02:42] to the final age
[1:02:45] and when we get that in our heart our
[1:02:47] job becomes even greater
[1:02:49] we're the final representatives
[1:02:52] the final witnesses
[1:02:54] to the final age
[1:02:56] and if you can't see that america has
[1:02:58] fallen apart you're not looking
[1:03:03] you're not the only one watching they
[1:03:05] are fulfilling scripture
[1:03:08] they're fulfilling the prophecy they are
[1:03:11] proving
[1:03:13] brother branham's message to be right
[1:03:18] are you with me listen
[1:03:19] you say well brother ron i don't know if
[1:03:20] brother brown's message is right just
[1:03:22] watch the news
[1:03:26] every day they are proven this message
[1:03:28] is right
[1:03:31] they have no moral conduct about
[1:03:34] themselves
[1:03:37] men's minds insanity
[1:03:41] every day children is murdered every day
[1:03:43] there's just incredible phenomenal sins
[1:03:46] that are abundant among us
[1:03:49] our politics is rotten to the core and
[1:03:53] i'm talking about all of them
[1:04:02] 2024 is not going to be the answer for
[1:04:05] america jesus is the only answer for
[1:04:09] america
[1:04:11] [Applause]
[1:04:24] we are at the end
[1:04:27] of the gentile
[1:04:29] dispensation
[1:04:33] it's going to switch to the jews
[1:04:36] and they are under expectation to get
[1:04:39] two prophets
[1:04:41] let me just drop back here for a minute
[1:04:43] i'm not going to get done today probably
[1:04:45] four or five and six is going to come
[1:04:47] but let me just say this to you
[1:04:50] in this age
[1:04:52] it had to be developed to where those
[1:04:54] two prophets could be seen around the
[1:04:56] world
[1:04:58] and preach the message that you have
[1:05:00] been listening to for decades
[1:05:04] they're going to preach the same message
[1:05:07] that was sent to the gentiles
[1:05:10] is going to be sent to the jews it was
[1:05:13] seals to the gentiles it's trumpets to
[1:05:16] the jews
[1:05:17] [Applause]
[1:05:19] are you with me now
[1:05:20] they are going to see the messiah signs
[1:05:24] moses and elijah will stand on the scene
[1:05:27] and preach the jesus christ of 2000
[1:05:30] years ago and to testify to them that
[1:05:34] they were he was crucified
[1:05:37] the lamb of god
[1:05:40] he will show them their ignorance down
[1:05:42] through the ages and open their eyes
[1:05:47] just as much as this message is hated by
[1:05:49] the gentiles
[1:05:52] they will be hated because of the
[1:05:54] message of the hour
[1:05:56] not because of who they are but they
[1:05:58] will be hated for the message of the
[1:06:00] hour in so much so until they will be
[1:06:04] slain in the street
[1:06:06] you live in an age to where the world
[1:06:09] can see it on their iphone
[1:06:12] there was not another age that could see
[1:06:15] it like this
[1:06:18] but god allowed the tree of knowledge to
[1:06:21] open itself hell opened it and enlarged
[1:06:24] itself
[1:06:25] to where two prophets could stand and
[1:06:28] preach
[1:06:32] and just as much oh there's millions of
[1:06:35] jews but there's some select seed there
[1:06:39] there's some select seed there that are
[1:06:42] destined to fulfill that 144 000
[1:06:47] and the seed that is on the inside of
[1:06:49] them respond to the message of their
[1:06:52] hour
[1:06:53] like it has responded to you
[1:06:56] [Applause]
[1:07:06] hallelujah
[1:07:09] we are not under expectation to fulfill
[1:07:12] and build an ark
[1:07:16] that's not our expectation
[1:07:19] we're not building carts
[1:07:22] to carry the ark of the covenant on
[1:07:25] that's not our expectation
[1:07:27] we are not going to be hung on a cross
[1:07:30] nailed with hands and thorns put in our
[1:07:32] heads that's not our part of our
[1:07:34] fulfillment
[1:07:37] are you with me
[1:07:41] but we are in the age to where a message
[1:07:43] came forth
[1:07:44] [Applause]
[1:07:45] and something on the inside of us
[1:07:47] responded
[1:07:51] some of us were called to be preachers
[1:07:53] some of us be called to be be this and
[1:07:55] that in your life but god anoints every
[1:07:58] one of us to be believers
[1:08:02] brother brown said there's three kind of
[1:08:03] believers in every church make believer
[1:08:06] unbeliever and real believers
[1:08:08] but i want you to understand that don't
[1:08:10] seal you into exactly where you are
[1:08:13] some of you were make believers but you
[1:08:15] became real believers
[1:08:17] some of you were unbelievers at one
[1:08:19] stage of your life but you became real
[1:08:22] believers
[1:08:25] thank god for his mercy
[1:08:27] thank god for his grace
[1:08:37] or if i could just get a glimpse of
[1:08:38] heaven
[1:08:39] i think our messenger has did that for
[1:08:41] us
[1:08:43] last night we got a little glimpse of
[1:08:45] hell
[1:08:46] it's a place where everybody's naked
[1:08:52] everybody's in their old bodies that
[1:08:54] they see and then
[1:08:56] everybody has stood the judgment
[1:08:59] let me just say this you i do not want
[1:09:01] to stand before an angry god
[1:09:04] where there's no negotiator there for me
[1:09:07] or no lawyer no perpetuation for me
[1:09:11] because of choices that i've made in my
[1:09:13] life and turned my back and walked over
[1:09:15] the blood of jesus christ for 40 50 70
[1:09:19] years
[1:09:23] come on church
[1:09:25] everybody's destined to go somewhere
[1:09:32] we talked about marilyn monroe last
[1:09:34] night we talked about the rich young
[1:09:36] ruler
[1:09:37] we talked about even elvis presley we
[1:09:39] talked about other people
[1:09:41] patsy cline and other people that we
[1:09:44] could that we can name
[1:09:46] sold the birthright
[1:09:51] so the birthright brother branham talks
[1:09:53] about preachers that were around him
[1:09:54] that would sell their birth life
[1:09:56] one named demon shakarian
[1:10:00] and he would sell pentecostal into the
[1:10:03] charismatic and to the catholic church
[1:10:06] and blend them together
[1:10:10] it produced seed
[1:10:15] the kardashians are the grandchildren
[1:10:19] of fallen children
[1:10:21] are you with me
[1:10:24] to show you how bad that got
[1:10:26] until one of them
[1:10:28] her husband
[1:10:31] of another race
[1:10:33] that wants to become a preacher and she
[1:10:35] don't want nothing to do with him
[1:10:37] then he wants to become a president she
[1:10:39] don't want nothing to do with him
[1:10:42] she don't want to do anything to do with
[1:10:43] god can you imagine that's only a couple
[1:10:45] of generations
[1:10:51] are you with me now i know you get quiet
[1:10:53] here for a minute but just stay with me
[1:10:56] listen it's the same as when wesley was
[1:10:58] here those modern methodists
[1:11:00] those methodists when the revival hit
[1:11:04] they danced they shouted
[1:11:07] they were anointed of the holy ghost
[1:11:10] they were slain in the spirit for hours
[1:11:12] and that move went around the world but
[1:11:16] men denominated that system
[1:11:19] [Music]
[1:11:21] men denominated that system and jesus
[1:11:24] dead and dry as she can be and today
[1:11:27] she's one of the leaders of sodom and
[1:11:30] gomorrah in pulpits
[1:11:34] john wesley if he could raise up he
[1:11:36] would be put out of their church
[1:11:40] you might as well preach with me it's
[1:11:42] gonna get good here in just a minute
[1:11:45] the modern pentecost of azusa street
[1:11:48] that burning flames that was in in in
[1:11:51] california that rose up and it went
[1:11:54] around the world and god allowed
[1:11:56] speaking in tongues and the flowing of
[1:11:58] the spirit of god
[1:12:01] you talk about a mighty revival god's
[1:12:04] not going to turn us back to azusa
[1:12:06] street he's turning us back to acts 2.
[1:12:10] and as a matter of fact it's not a
[1:12:11] turning back it's a going forward
[1:12:15] because god's not regressing he's going
[1:12:17] progressing
[1:12:27] all right
[1:12:29] catching my breath
[1:12:32] i'm in a fight with a bad boy i'm going
[1:12:34] to win
[1:12:44] but men denominated
[1:12:47] men
[1:12:48] denominated that system
[1:12:52] brother management used a statement he
[1:12:53] said how can we preserve what we got
[1:12:59] they tried to preserve
[1:13:02] yesterday's manna
[1:13:07] listen and there's churches set all over
[1:13:09] the world trying to feed on yesterday's
[1:13:11] manna and it produces death
[1:13:16] listen i'm not being judgmental here but
[1:13:19] by their fruits you'll know them
[1:13:23] by your fruits your no i know there's a
[1:13:25] redeemed that'll come out of all of that
[1:13:27] but let me just say this to you
[1:13:29] they denominated and death got among
[1:13:32] them
[1:13:34] now their churches is full of
[1:13:35] cross-dressers
[1:13:44] if if wigglesworth could come back
[1:13:47] and preach to them
[1:13:52] let me just pick one if wigglesworth let
[1:13:55] me get two if charles feeney
[1:13:58] could walk back into his church and see
[1:14:01] what has been produced for all of these
[1:14:04] years
[1:14:07] i'm going somewhere now
[1:14:08] if they could see what they have done
[1:14:10] with all of their boards and all of
[1:14:12] their economical movements
[1:14:15] they could not identify with what was
[1:14:17] there
[1:14:20] charles spurgeon who was one of the
[1:14:22] greatest preachers ever lived his own
[1:14:24] church don't want nothing to do with him
[1:14:29] his own school
[1:14:31] said we do not want to be identified
[1:14:34] with charles spurgeon
[1:14:36] one of the greatest preachers that ever
[1:14:38] lived
[1:14:39] his own school that he worked so hard to
[1:14:43] produce
[1:14:44] the cathedral that he worked so hard to
[1:14:46] build
[1:14:48] collected money for decades to build
[1:14:50] that cathedral that would seat six
[1:14:53] thousand and every service he preached
[1:14:56] 12 000 people would show up and then
[1:14:58] they would fill the outside of the
[1:15:00] building and he would stand and preach
[1:15:06] and now they don't want nothing to do
[1:15:07] with him
[1:15:09] they don't want nothing to do with him
[1:15:12] i say this to you
[1:15:14] what a shame
[1:15:18] if i could talk to the president of that
[1:15:20] school
[1:15:21] let me just say i'm not bothered by
[1:15:23] people who they are
[1:15:25] i'm not a tim intimidated by offices
[1:15:28] i'm not intimidated by men i serve a
[1:15:31] living god
[1:15:42] i worked at a company 4 800 employees
[1:15:44] when i was a young man i was younger
[1:15:46] than you
[1:15:48] and i said lord i want to witness to
[1:15:49] every person that i can in this bill in
[1:15:52] this
[1:15:52] in this
[1:15:54] arsenal
[1:15:55] and one day i prayed
[1:15:58] god
[1:15:59] help me to be able to get to a spot to
[1:16:02] where that i can witness to the
[1:16:04] president of this company
[1:16:08] 4 800 employees no way could i just walk
[1:16:11] into his office do you know god worked
[1:16:14] it out to where i was able to walk into
[1:16:16] his office
[1:16:19] and satan speak we became friends and i
[1:16:22] introduced the message of the hour to
[1:16:24] him
[1:16:30] let me just say this you
[1:16:32] the witness and the power of the candle
[1:16:34] of light
[1:16:36] cannot be put out
[1:16:39] in our lives we are focused
[1:16:55] we've had men
[1:16:58] even in the message and i'm just gonna i
[1:16:59] don't never do this but i'm just going
[1:17:01] to do this
[1:17:02] that don't want music being played
[1:17:08] you know where they brought that from
[1:17:09] their old dead lutheranism
[1:17:12] they didn't get that from the message
[1:17:13] they brought that from their dead
[1:17:15] lutheranism
[1:17:16] they don't want a pair of drums in their
[1:17:19] church
[1:17:20] you know where they brought that from
[1:17:21] their old dad lutheranism
[1:17:25] listen drums were played in the in the
[1:17:27] house of god in david's day they played
[1:17:30] on drums and high sounding symbols
[1:17:35] we are only fulfilling the word of god
[1:17:43] the reason churches are dead is because
[1:17:46] they've got an ice maker for a pastor
[1:18:07] ice makers produce ice cubes
[1:18:10] i do not want ice cubes sitting all over
[1:18:13] this building
[1:18:14] dead it's zero 40 below zero i want
[1:18:18] people from fire for god but we'll come
[1:18:21] here to worship god
[1:18:24] hallelujah
[1:18:28] glory to god
[1:18:37] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:18:40] [Applause]
[1:18:51] well we don't speak in tongues no more
[1:18:53] we don't want any of that we're we've
[1:18:55] grown up we've matured
[1:18:57] we don't want prayer lines
[1:19:00] we don't want all of those things
[1:19:02] we don't want all those emotions
[1:19:04] the reason men preach like that is
[1:19:07] because they don't have the holy ghost
[1:19:09] themselves
[1:19:12] [Music]
[1:19:13] and if you don't believe in the product
[1:19:15] you can't sell it
[1:19:18] come on church
[1:19:22] but it's in the bible it is the
[1:19:24] fulfillment of the word of god
[1:19:27] this bride will be born of his own life
[1:19:29] of his life power of his power if he hit
[1:19:32] on 16 cylinders so will the bribe
[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:19:39] if there was miracles in his day
[1:19:41] there'll be miracles in our day if he
[1:19:43] could live it in his day we can live it
[1:19:46] in our day

[1:22:12] and tried to mar your life but he put
[1:22:14] you in the midst of darkness that little

[1:22:21] have been this and he could have been
[1:22:22] that he could have been there but there
[1:22:24] was a seed on the inside of him
[1:22:27] that kept pulling him
[1:22:29] it was more than mom and daddy it was
[1:22:31] more than another day's revival he
[1:22:34] needed his own revival
[1:22:42] [Music]
[1:22:50] can you imagine how many sermons you
[1:22:51] preach
[1:22:54] you sisters preach walking down the
[1:22:56] aisles of food line
[1:23:01] more than your dress there's a lot of
[1:23:02] people dressed like you
[1:23:04] more than your dress but your atmosphere
[1:23:08] there's one thing that you can't put on
[1:23:09] this atmosphere
[1:23:14] and god will not stay on a contaminated
[1:23:16] vessel
[1:23:18] god won't live in a hypocrite's life
[1:23:21] and i'll tell you what a real believer's
[1:23:23] got the real atmosphere and they got an
[1:23:25] incredible attitude
[1:23:28] they're they're full of joy they're full
[1:23:30] regardless of what you're going through
[1:23:32] in your life
[1:23:34] let me just say if the experience of
[1:23:36] difficulties of your life has robbed you
[1:23:39] of your joy
[1:23:44] hey god dealt with me to stop right here
[1:23:46] just for a minute let me just stop here
[1:23:47] just for a moment
[1:23:48] this may be somebody on the internet
[1:23:51] if you have been robbed of your joy
[1:23:57] and your life
[1:24:00] because of the circumstances of life
[1:24:03] has has bound you whether it's physical
[1:24:07] or financial or whatever situation it is
[1:24:12] if you have become backslidden in your
[1:24:14] spirit
[1:24:15] to where your prayer life is gone
[1:24:20] come on i feel like the hounds of hell
[1:24:22] wanting to run at me right now bring it
[1:24:24] on
[1:24:26] i know where i'm standing now
[1:24:28] but too many people sat in church pews
[1:24:31] backslidden
[1:24:33] got no joy got no praise
[1:24:38] listen your difficulties ought to cause
[1:24:40] you to praise him more than ever before
[1:24:43] if you can't do nothing but move your
[1:24:45] finger move your finger
[1:24:57] if all you're doing is thinking about
[1:24:59] negative things turn the bottle upside
[1:25:01] down get yourself full of faith
[1:25:05] [Applause]
[1:25:10] well that was page one
[1:25:28] jesus knows what it is like to have a
[1:25:29] headache
[1:25:31] because his head
[1:25:33] was crowned with thorns
[1:25:37] jesus knows what it's like to be hungry
[1:25:40] he went without food for 40 days
[1:25:44] jesus knows what it's like to be
[1:25:46] slandered or abandoned
[1:25:48] because on the cross
[1:25:51] he screams my god my god why hast thou
[1:25:53] forsaken me
[1:25:58] jesus
[1:25:59] willingly
[1:26:02] experienced this kind of desolation
[1:26:09] jesus knows what it's like to be a
[1:26:11] refugee
[1:26:13] to have to flee
[1:26:16] his own homeland
[1:26:17] to live under oppression of a government
[1:26:21] he sure did
[1:26:22] they had to flee egypt
[1:26:24] to say flee to egypt to save jesus
[1:26:28] his life
[1:26:30] he lived under roman empire
[1:26:32] under a an oppressive government
[1:26:36] let me just say this right here
[1:26:40] these refugees that are coming
[1:26:44] they're coming to a place that they
[1:26:46] believe is a better place than where
[1:26:47] they were
[1:26:48] at and whether you remember this or not
[1:26:51] you were one at one day
[1:26:56] we were all refugees at one time i'm not
[1:26:59] talking about necessarily you i'm
[1:27:00] talking about your forefathers
[1:27:05] so don't get yourself so tied up in the
[1:27:07] news
[1:27:09] until you become anti all of this
[1:27:11] different kind of stuff you too were a
[1:27:13] refugee
[1:27:15] you too jesus was a refugee
[1:27:27] i'm honestly one now
[1:27:29] i don't feel comfortable here no more
[1:27:34] and i really want to go
[1:27:37] but i really want you to go with me
[1:27:41] connie'll grabbed me some night she said
[1:27:43] you're not going you're not going
[1:27:45] tonight i
[1:27:46] uh you're staying here till i go with
[1:27:48] you
[1:27:52] hallelujah
[1:27:53] hallelujah
[1:27:55] jesus knows what it's like to suffer
[1:27:59] in fact he suffered many
[1:28:01] more
[1:28:02] than any of us ever will
[1:28:07] jesus know what it's like to weep
[1:28:10] and mourn
[1:28:12] he wept over jerusalem
[1:28:16] his own country
[1:28:20] let me just say this don't you get
[1:28:22] yourself so discouraged when you get
[1:28:26] rejected turned down you feel that
[1:28:30] little funny feeling
[1:28:31] they just don't want me here
[1:28:34] they didn't want jesus
[1:28:40] they did not want jesus
[1:28:44] i'm going somewhere here in just a
[1:28:46] minute
[1:28:48] jesus knows the pain of grief
[1:28:52] when he come to the tomb of his friend
[1:28:54] lazarus
[1:28:57] he wept
[1:28:59] remember what brother brahm said he wept
[1:29:00] because of their unbelief
[1:29:03] that's what he would have really wept he
[1:29:05] knew he had the power to raise him back
[1:29:06] up
[1:29:07] but they didn't believe he had the power
[1:29:10] he had preached to them all this time
[1:29:12] and
[1:29:13] their faith was arisen to a spot that
[1:29:15] they could believe in jesus
[1:29:17] that could raise their their friend
[1:29:19] lazarus up what about the jesus that can
[1:29:21] change our bodies
[1:29:26] what about that jesus that'll change our
[1:29:28] bodies
[1:29:30] jesus knows jesus knows what hurt hands
[1:29:33] are
[1:29:33] feet
[1:29:35] or burned or
[1:29:37] have your flesh torn or your heart
[1:29:38] broken
[1:29:41] look at what jesus went through and the
[1:29:43] agony of the garden
[1:29:45] the carrying of the cross being mocked
[1:29:48] being spat upon having nails driven
[1:29:51] through his hands and his feet then
[1:29:53] scourged terribly
[1:29:55] the lord suffered more than the lord
[1:29:57] suffered more than any of
[1:30:00] us could ever imagine
[1:30:03] christ took our place on the cross
[1:30:10] that it might be
[1:30:12] fulfilled
[1:30:15] did he not fulfill that
[1:30:26] i'm not going to get done so i just want
[1:30:27] to share some words that just mean a lot
[1:30:29] to me
[1:30:30] i thought about this this morning
[1:30:35] if spurgeon couldn't go back to his own
[1:30:37] school and to his own church
[1:30:41] imagine how rejected he would feel
[1:30:46] if john wesley wouldn't be welcomed
[1:30:51] at the modern methodist church
[1:30:56] that would be called a relic
[1:31:04] your grandfather
[1:31:06] sister cassie
[1:31:07] i sat on the bed with him
[1:31:10] not long before he left
[1:31:13] and he looked in my eyes and he said
[1:31:15] what you have is truth
[1:31:18] and he's very sincere with that
[1:31:24] he said but i'm the last of the
[1:31:25] flickering flame
[1:31:27] where i'm at
[1:31:32] and his words were this
[1:31:34] and i've never shared this
[1:31:36] he said
[1:31:39] i feel like a relic
[1:31:44] my own church
[1:31:47] all of that just kept coming to me this
[1:31:49] morning as
[1:31:51] i was preparing
[1:31:56] i thought about brother hormer
[1:32:02] if he would come
[1:32:03] back on resurrection morning
[1:32:08] i believe if he could look across the
[1:32:10] realm and
[1:32:11] see andrew dancing
[1:32:14] andrew with that one finger out
[1:32:17] shuffling his feet behind the pulpit
[1:32:19] just like he did
[1:32:21] holding on just like he did
[1:32:27] watching matthew watching you worship
[1:32:30] this building
[1:32:31] many are gone because of sickness and
[1:32:33] then because of a meeting but this
[1:32:35] building full
[1:32:37] the dancing of the
[1:32:39] the spirit of the lord
[1:32:41] is still welcome here
[1:32:44] brother brown's message is still welcome
[1:32:46] here
[1:32:48] i believe he could stand here and be
[1:32:49] extremely proud of what he sees
[1:33:05] i'd say there's a lot of places brother
[1:33:06] branham wouldn't be welcome
[1:33:10] i'd say there's a lot of places that he
[1:33:12] wouldn't be welcome
[1:33:13] but i want you to know he would be
[1:33:15] welcome here
[1:33:17] [Applause]
[1:33:35] i literally feel like two realms is
[1:33:37] coming together this morning
[1:33:40] i feel like i'm standing in a very
[1:33:43] very special place
[1:33:46] i really feel that way
[1:33:48] i feel like i'm standing in a very
[1:33:50] special place
[1:33:59] i close with these words
[1:34:05] when god spoke out of heaven over jesus
[1:34:07] he said
[1:34:09] this is my beloved son
[1:34:12] in whom i'm well pleased
[1:34:15] to dwell
[1:34:20] i'd like for that to be fulfilled in our
[1:34:22] lives
[1:34:25] that god would testify
[1:34:29] this is my beloved son daughters
[1:34:34] that i'm well pleased
[1:34:37] to dwell in
[1:34:39] let's stare
