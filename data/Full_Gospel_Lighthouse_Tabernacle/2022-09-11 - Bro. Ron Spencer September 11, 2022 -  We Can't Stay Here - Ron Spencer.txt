before you this morning and proclaim the victory again block the devil's eye one more time amen amen i i want to first of all say uh for our 50th anniversary for coming through the fire for those that don't know we were just hours we had been in a coma almost a month and uh lungs were burned and face and arms were burned but they were getting ready to harvest my organs in about five more hours and uh brother tim pruitt preached two sermons on god's hall of fame thankfully i was in it and the second one i or the i don't know the exact chronological order but the other one was god will have a testimony and for 15 years we've had a testimony and so we thank the lord for that had not those lungs healed they could have never sustained the cancer that is in them so so they always tell me that your lungs are in great shape they're almost like young but there's cancer in them but isn't god good it just does so many wonderful things and i want to thank you i want to echo the thought some of you wasn't here last night but i want to echo the thoughts of andrew of all the teams of players that were in the media that done so many things thank you thank you thank you thank you i'm sorry i wasn't feeling well through the meeting but and i couldn't participate as much as i would have liked to but this is a journey it's a difficult journey but it gives us grace day by day for those that don't know of the difficulty of cancer how many has ever fought cancer you've fought cancer in your life even the good days are kind of like having the flu and so so ain't none of us enjoy how many's had the flu yeah did you like that no i didn't like that either so it's kind of like having the flu even on good days and so and so we're thankful that god has given us mercy these two and a half years and toward in a couple more weeks i go back for more scans and all of that kind of business not giving you a health report but day by day week we we have a good day and have bad days and tomorrow will be even a better day so we're so thankful so so we certainly enjoyed everything that happened last week and uh last night's sermon was just over the top and so i i i one day i want to preach like andrew so man so amen things kind of turned around for me so but i want to thank you for your giving that's a portion of it as well that was one portion that you didn't you you covered all the bases except for the one but not just not just the giving for the meaning but the weekly giving that you give to the body of christ and it helps us to it helps us to put stairways up the hill and helps us to pay the lights it it helps to it helps to do so many things to give to missions and and so many things that we do behind the scenes we don't make a real vocal effort about that but god has a program of your tithes and offerings you give god will bless you back those that internet gave and we thank you for that and we so appreciate your helping us as a body you're a part of us uh you some of some of the people that have talked about even talked about brother jeffrey how well he was dressed last week and so i mean they notice everything and so hey man so and you did look good so we love you today we thank you for everything the lord laid this on my heart this uh last week and so i i wanna i wanna i wanna speak to you on we can't stay here we've come to this place but we can't stay here god has brought us he's gathered us here but we're we're now in a journey some of you are moving from north carolina and now i'm going to talk to you about moving again yeah but this time in your move you you won't have to pack a bag it's not nice isn't that nice yeah i'd like for us to turn to first thessalonians chapter 5 and in verse 1. amen i so love you with all of my heart and amen amen now this is paul after he has just preached the sermon and now this is in conjunction because notice notice it says but so the thought is not finished so he's talked about rapture and the sequences of rapture but now he's going to talk to us about things that we must be very much aware of this is for believers this is for believers now but of the times and seasons brethren you have no need that i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they say i shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travaileth upon a woman with a child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtook you as a thief you're the children of the light and children of the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunken are drunken in the not but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet in the hope of salvation for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even also ye do amen let's pray lord jesus we love you this morning wow what a wonderful time to be in the house of the lord why in laodicea people are going in every direction and hearing every kind of a voice thank god that we have an ear to hear and it's been tuned in to hear the voice of the lord to prepare us for our going home i asked you today that you would bless people's hearts touch them today both here and invisible we ask you that you would anoint us together anoint the speaker lord you see our circumstances of life and i ask you to bring strength to us today lord not only the speaker but also the hearer we pray that you would minister to every need those that need a baptism of the holy ghost as we heard the prophet coming down the road sister you're you're desiring the holy ghost this sister here has desired the holy ghost that brother he's desiring the holy ghost why all of us are desiring more of you tonight father i ask you today that you'd speak to our hearts and feel us like never before may it be a refeeling of your presence and an anointing of god may the angels of god just sweep through this building may demons be thwarted at bay and pushed out of this place in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen you may be seated me it's not kobe my thought this morning is we can't stay here it doesn't take a very spiritual man to know that this world is falling apart this world is in a collision course with the tribulation period where brother branham would use the term love would leave the earth when the bride of christ would be taken off of the sea all that would be saved in the gentile dispensation is saved on this side of the rapture so get your loved ones in get your loved ones in get them get them in it's it's more important than anything that's going on in washington get your loved ones to the foot of the crowd across it to know jesus that that at least that jesus will hold them throughout the horror of the tribulation period what's going on in ukraine or at the holocaust brother branham would use this term would be like a sunday afternoon picnic compared to what the tribulation has in store for it remember who is in charge of the tribulation period we heard about king jesus last night but king satan is going to be given a little little opportunity on the earth and he is going to unleash his powers remember his his triumph his triumphant trinity is kill steal and destroy satan is not your friend he is not nobody to negotiate with he will make you many offers in your life never take up one of them last week we last week we had phenomenal meetings and in those phenomenal meetings we heard such powerful thoughts it was god speaking to us through ministry one more time to hear the voice of the lord brother timothy pruitt spoke on friday night and he may be his father's son and maybe an associate speaker there but he's a convention speaker in his own he don't have to let nobody hold his briefcase for him he's a powerful speaker but there was a thought that just kept resonating in my heart and he said as we are astronauts and they're sitting on top of those incredible tons of energies that were below them men have died because of those things blowing up but they're trusting in their training they're trusting in their vision they're trusting in the mechanics and he said as they're leaving the earth they're not worried about what's going on down here their focus is on there maybe they might be there and they're circling the earth and look at the earth from that sphere they're not worried about the light bill they're not worried about their dog being fed they've left it and as our vision begins to change toward heaven the lest this world's gravity has a hulk of our lives remember enoch began to walk with god and the more that he walked with god the less this world meant to him that don't mean jobs are not important that don't mean education's not important your home is not important that don't mean that we live like a bunch of vacant bonds [Music] but this world is not our home [Applause] brother tim spoke to us on investigating angels the week before he had spoke on entertaining angels that was a great message too you can go listen to that but remember those angels are here investigating brother branham would point it out and i and i just want to brother branham would point out those ufos that they were investigating angels that were on the earth our governments has denied the sightings of those but but let me just say this to you they're not just reporting on sodom and gomorrah but they're reporting that there is a bribe that has assembled herself not just a bride from america but from around the world we have been gathered and we're not some immature girlfriend but we are a mature lady now that the wedding gown fit perfectly we're an impres we're an impregnated bride bringing forth jesus christ as a matter of fact we can term it like this we are the bride's coming of jesus christ hallelujah under the bride's coming and under that seven angels appeared in in arizona we're a people worthy to hear that word will people that can handle the word we're not denominational feeders as we heard last night we are very if we we were in a chicken yard but we couldn't stay there because redemption is coming out but it's also going in and so we must understand that we are worthy by the blood of the lamb and this was not william branham's message but that was the who he came through but it's the message of the lamb and he slipped the wedding band of a predestinated unmerited grace on our finger before the foundation of the world amen so we're feeding on the mighty angel that's here we heard brother donny reagan come and he spoke and we certainly enjoyed blowing up dams unplugging the the pipes we sure enjoyed that when that we have been told as ministers that we're we're not beaver dam preachers and you know in this church we're not going to damn up your worship [Applause] and i've always wanted it to be that if brother branham would come back on the scene and if he could stand here and preach i would like for him to be very comfortable to address he never got the opportunity to address a message church i'd like for him to be very comfortable to address this portion of the bride of jesus christ and i could like to be able to say brother branham you could preach anything you want to hear that you preached we believe it all amen if you have an uncomfortable level of certain things that's being preached you just go need to get that right with god don't miss the rapture with that there was a story that was told i'm going to tell you two stories that was told one was told by brother branham one was told by spurgeon there was a man that was a gold digger and he and he tried to find gold it spent his life trying to get it gold and something was driving him became older in his life and one day he he he hit it he finally hit it and he was making his way back into town too to cash his gold in because in that form it was gold but it wasn't spendable and so he came to the portion of a town that he was getting close this would be the last night to which that he would have to spend as a poor man or a digger but what he didn't know there was a dog that there was a man that was following him and this man had a purpose he didn't go dig the goal he didn't go labor for the gold but he knowed that he had it and he was going to take it away from him and this man that had dug the gold had a dog and that dog was warning warning the man that discovered it the man was trying to sleep it was his last night of being poor he was trying to sleep tomorrow i'll be rich tomorrow i'll be rich this dog was the voice of warning and he was warning he was warning that that prospector that there was somebody that was following him and the man became very agitated with that with that voice of warning and so he shot that dog he shot the dog and what he didn't realize he shot the only thing that was his protector between life and death for those that's been around a while this was the thought that i used at brother brother homer frazier's funeral how many remember that brother homer had been the voice of warning for so many people and god had taken that chess piece off of the scene we must realize and what i was trying to get to that it's got to be more than daddy's religion or or a certain religion in the world it's got to be christ with you and so many wanted to in this local area wanted to discredit brother homer being too emotional or when he would preach at funerals he would he would get right in people's cur and and he would get right with them but what they didn't realize when you turn down christ hey listen there's a i got a long way to go here help me now somewhere in your journey when you turn down christ i do not want to be known for living 70 80 90 years on the earth and somewhere in that juncture about 45 years along that journey you made a left turn and you never got back to where you got off [Applause] brother branham tells a story about a man dying on the battlefield and said another man came and he said i knew christ at one time and he says what do i do he said go back where you left him and he prayed a childhood prayer how many decades did that man how many decades did that man live and now he's at the point of death minutes from dying but he has the opportunity to go back you talk about grace after the meeting was over we generally do something with the speakers that can go brother aaron that will speak again for us brother aaron oglesby he's a he was a high school teacher a history teacher i think that's one of one of the keys that makes him such a phenomenal speaker but anyway he's not only a history teacher but he's a civil war specialist so he we went to we went to we targeted on monday went to antietam and then we went to gettysburg now it's one thing to go and look it all over and see corn see fences see statues read all about it but for a man that has studied in his life and is a preacher he can literally figuratively make that battle live amen and so at antietam i begin to realize he has studied this he's ready for it he's anointed for this day and we're on more than a tour second day we went and we went to gettysburg they were calling for a hundred percent chance of rain all day when we arrived it quit raining and it started raining after we left we toured it it took us about this tour was supposed to take about three hours it took us much longer than that and we came to the place where general lee was looking a mile away at general meade and i'm not going to tell you the civil war two opposing forces and general lee was getting ready to give the command to charge up that hill the war is going to go on two more years but they're going to go to where what they call the high water mark lee realized understanding lee realized we've got to do this we've got we come to this battle by now standing with lee was picket some of our father's grandfathers was with pickett research tells me i thought it was two but research tells me i had three grandfathers in that in that charge now i'm going to tell you this there was so much lead exchange that day it was like waves of lead being exchanged backwards and forwards until one rail fence just one rail had over 860 pieces of lead in that rail for three of my grandfathers to make that charge and live one was a neens one was a wickham and he was a colonel and i don't and right now the other name won't come to me maybe a smith but all three of them made the charging in wickham brother george quinn i know you'll watch this and you can tell me that third one's name but but let me just say this to you you think that you're not protected by god as i stood in the middle of that field and then later we would stand at the top of that field and we would look down from where generals died great men gave their life for a cause poor men fight rich man's battles that's what happens but they listen let me just say we've came to this battle there must be a resurrection there must be a rapture we're not here to just have an have another church we just didn't have that meeting that we had last week to say we had a great meeting and you know now let's just settle down we got to keep going up there's a story that spurgeon pills in history there was a a great cliff great boulder monstrous boulder that was out over top of this cliff it made a great shelter for a man in the night from a rainstorm i want you to follow this very closely but this man set up shelter there then he set up life then he got married then he had children then he had a colony all under this danger this boulder is going to give way but now he's living with sin and it's over his head knowing that one day it'll collapse but now it's more than just him sin affects more than just you [Applause] it affects more than just your family and then a family becomes a community and a community becomes a town and a town becomes a city [Music] geologists came and warned them why are you living here amen spurgeon said he preached a sermon on it you can go read it he preached a sermon on it he said people can live under the devastation of sin and he said they'll live and they die and they live their life out not realizing they're passing their sins to the next generation but there's a cure for it to get moved move don't stay here [Applause] don't stay here you know the end of the story before i even tell you that man died his family died but a city was crushed imagine how many thousands of people had decided it's not worth listening to the warning los angeles has been told that they're going under the sea but a voice of warning came and told them because god don't send he don't bring judgment until he wins a warning and brother branham's message was not only it was a message people say well it was so difficult no no no no you got it wrong it was a message of grace it was a message of grace all but he told us how to dress well if that's the way god wants you to dress i'll take god's choice [Applause] well he won't let us drink wine and he won't let us drink beer really really is that what's got you all upset that your brain cells are not destroyed well marriage and divorce upsets me so much really we can have great families and great husbands and wives and we can have an altar in our house and our our children can love to come to church [Applause] they can love to come to church and they can enjoy it sitting around the table last night isaac is repeating many things of of andrew's sermon these little guys may look like they're not paying any attention at all but they are paying very much attention they can handle god's word [Applause] okay last week we had many different deliverances but they can't stay where they were just to fall back into the same rut and live the same way that they did you can't stand there we live in america i don't know i'm just going to talk about america now we live in america where gambling is is one of the biggest habits that people are involved in gas stations really don't even are not really concerned whether they sell gas or not as long as they have a gambling room i'm not getting that second hand in now but they build a room for gambling partner where you can go in and just play and punch punch listen you're not going to win i don't know if you've got the bulletin or not but you're not going to win sitting there keeping putting dollars in they're going to win they're only going to give you enough to keep you coming but i want to say this to you don't gamble with your soul andrew talked last night and i thought oh here we go and he talked about the road to emmaus and right there's my note on the road to emmaus that was already there for two weeks so since you put it on my heart too i'll just i'll just talk to you a little bit about it now the reason i'm going at this pace is my energy level's a little bit lower so is this all right [Applause] at least i'm still going [Applause] and so so these boys had saw they had saw the trial these were disciples they had saw the trial they never expected that they really never expected that they saw him get scourged and he was beat they didn't put some isaiah 53 with him being physically beat to where that now his organs is showing through his ribs that's right they never put isaiah 53 the prophecy with the happening amen are you with me it's really hard for you to to have prophecy and time to intersect and you catch it so that's why i'm preaching here this morning and so and so they're standing watching jesus knowing he has power to call 10 000 angels and he don't do it this is the same man that beat and took cords and put them together and beat those there's pharisees and those sadducees and whip them out of the temple they see them get mad and tell them you've turned my father's house into a den of thieves they've seen him calm the storm they were in the boat they seen him calm the storm they saw him call lazarus out of a grave tell him take a grade clothes off of him we're getting ready to go have dinner [Applause] they've seen the damsel arise they've seen him feed the 5000 twice they've seen legion become a real man they've seen blind bartimaeus not blind no more and under a new identification but now they're seeing jesus allow himself they were asleep when jesus prayed father let this cup pass from me when he realizes i've got to pay for the sins of the world not just heal five thousand or or or feed five thousand or raise lazarus from the grave or tell them who that i am but his greatest task was pay for a man to pay for all sin listen moses identified himself as an attribute of god abraham identified as an attribute of god phenomenal prophets listen they're stood noah on the ark preaching 120 years knowing only eight people were wanted going to stay on that ark and yet on the other side some of them were not going to do the will of the father are you with me now stay with me no wonder these disciples were discouraged they watched jesus surrender to the cross sometimes we pray for things and we get them and then they cry on us don't be discouraged in there enjoy that enjoy that that's life that's life i always took on my babies got all upset you know you know sometimes as parents we get all embarrassed and our children are acting up you know you know do your best to kind of keep them in line but it's life god watches us sometimes get upset he don't sweep us off of the earth just life key that's a key now these boys are walking away they're so discouraged brother branham begins to say these latest happenings that have happened so discourages them they're walking and a man joins them and they don't recognize who he is and he's walking with them now here's where i want to go with this i wonder sometimes if we realize meeting last week meeting before last week meetings before and even this morning that he comes into our services and he comes many ways you know we all we all can feel him when the the rain the fire is going we're all standing we're cheering we're screaming we all can feel the presence of god but when he's quiet when he's quiet when he's kind of in that loving mood you know what i'm talking about when he's in that loving mood and it's just you and him you're sitting at the pew and you feel you kind of feel the presence of the lord jesus walks up beside of them they don't recognize who he is and he's with them there's nothing you can do greater than walk with jesus well i haven't had any supernatural happening today really you walk with him he came to your house he was there you had a peaceful day in laodicea children went to school they wasn't bullied they wasn't all of this different kind of thing and they walked with jesus and he took them by the hand angels are there to protect them maybe a car would have ran over them in the driveway and an angel just scooted them this way sometimes it's not what you see oh come on church come on church sometimes we want to be so spiritual we want to be speaking in tongues and seeing visions and all these different just walk with him walk with him when you're sick walk with him when you die walk with him when you could just just walk with him walk with him when you're getting a's walk with him when you're getting bees and seas and d's and just keep walking with him in this six-hour conversation with jesus andrew went through it with you he reminds them of the prophecies and he carefully asked them because remember brother branham said would you like to hear what jesus talked to them about amen now now let's just remember this brother branham told us what eve looked like i wonder how he knew that he talked to us about how melchizedek operated and then showed us how melchizedek operated it wasn't a show to the world but we got to see jesus in our day in our church and what is he doing among us even now he's reminding us that the prophecy that has been laying there for centuries even thousands of years is about to become active when you're talking about resurrection power he has showed us in in from winter to spring and the the the power that's in the seed that lays dormant through the wrath of the winter because the sap has went down and then that spring sun begins to shine on it again and all of a sudden those leaves become listen i love that now i love that i love the fall how god paints those that's never been to the shenandoah valley we live in one of the most beautiful places in the world we have all different varieties of the tree and every one of those trees will go in a different shape and a different color and it's just god's painting all over it but that painting is telling us that winter is coming what's going on now in this harvest ring it's preparing us that there's coming a resurrection and that we're going to see the dead in christ rise first and we're going to meet the lord in vietnam because we can't stay here we can't stay here now the bride must be in step with the word if you remember he told adam don't add or take away don't eat of that tree and when he ate of that tree it sent him in a it sent him in a trajectory so we're reminded that like we have been speaking on the orchestra don't change the sheet music just just don't do it don't don't change the sheet music now elaheezer's job he was a type of the messenger that would come in our day and we wasn't to fall in love and marry brother branham but we were to fall in love with the message to get us ready for jesus christ because we're not just one of the girlfriends we're the wife [Music] and rebecca was going to be his wife and and and and the songs written about it elohizer tell me more what does he really look like we would learn about isaac hear about isaac but remember she couldn't stay in her homeland and be married to isaac so the angel had to get ahead of eloheeser and meet with her and give her the nudge so what has been happening to you is there's angel visitations [Music] that happens in your hall now so i don't point nobody out here brother john steeman is a phenomenal example he hated this message hated it he moved his wife all across the country trying to get her away finally in sarasota florida she was going long story short she was going him being mennonite she was going to a baptismal service and he was so mad he was going to take the children he was going to leave with the children he was going to go they were going to leave because she was following this message of the hour that her mother had got healed of cancer they had witnessed the angel's visitation they had witnessed many things and he is so mad that she's going to to a baptismal service and he's going around the house and you know those old houses to where you would have a path all the way around we used to chase a dog all the way around like that and play tag all the way around some of you probably got one of them houses where you just run you run from all those rooms all the way around that deal and he was going around and about his seventh time around he said i'll go with you she's thinking he's gonna mess something up and he got baptized because there was a seed there god never gave up on him regardless of all his nonsense if there's a seed inside of you he'll never give up on you all right very personal friend of mine brother jim babb he's gone to be with the lord he married a general's daughter beautiful young lady kind of living he had been a baseball player and got his i believe it was his knee blowed out well the big leagues didn't want him no more so he joins the military and the military puts him into baseball pretty snazzy deal the general wanted him to watch over his daughter and his daughter turned out to be his wife that's pretty slick his mother and father were message believers and he thought he was getting away from the message by leaving and going and following his ambitions one day he comes home and he's always getting packages of tapes in the mail never paying no attention throwing them aside one day he comes home and his wife is all crying and and and she said jimmy why didn't you tell me and i'm just paraphrasing here why didn't you tell me about what's in these tapes she's done give her heart to the lord and he said god what have you done with my wife the general's daughter and what he had tried to move her away from she got right into because she was a seed and maybe along your road you have journeyed i have never yet put you from brazil with a guy from harrisonburg and you come to this church in covet conditions and you stuck when there's about 10 of us here you had no idea that all of these people were going to be your brothers and sisters in christ and you come from way over there and here you come and you sit down and go boy this must have been a small church this must be a church way in decline what in the world's going on preacher gets up and preaches a couple people sings and you know they have church dismissed nobody shakes your hand no they survived [Music] they got no special pampering no special watering and no no but because they were sick [Applause] brother lawrence would drive by this place and many years ago he was here he was he was an absolute pillar of this church circumstance happened crushed him and he was out for decades and he would drive by this place in delivery and every time he drove by something would echo in his heart and he said the hardest journey i ever made was from the parking lot to the back door but he said immediately when i walked in i knew i was home [Applause] i'm sorry god has put us all on a journey and it's a journey that com just commissions just to keep walking never settle down and get relaxed and make a camp and say i don't have to go any further there's always further with god now remember this well brother ron i don't understand everything well let me give you a quote that will fit your need brother branham said through out the eternities i don't even know how you explain eternities david how old are you you're older than me but 62 is nothing to 200. you would have to live three lifetimes plus 20 more years to get to 200. and 200 is nothing to a thousand and a thousand is nothing to a hundred thousand and a hundred thou oh you're with me now are you with me there's not going to be a big bend there's not going to be a timex swarsky or no swiss watch ever going to be in heaven [Applause] well i'm gonna rest when i get there well i'm gonna have a new body and what i understand in that new body it ain't gonna get tired [Applause] i'm not gonna feel what i feel right now in that new body it's not gonna get tired imagine that i might just run a marathon every [Applause] day andrew you want to run a little while matthew might say you know down there on earth i couldn't run with you boys but that's built for power i think i'll run with you guys today [Applause] the other night i prayed for brother tim to have a special visitation while he was while he was there at the house he came to the table and he was crying and he said all night it was just all night i was with sister karen and we was both young that meant the absolute world to me that meant the absolute world to me joshua knew we've came out of we came out of egypt we're out here in the wilderness but we can't stay here it was a type of us coming out of denominationalism and maybe even got under certain speakers that were eloquent incredible speakers in the message but they were just about kingdom building we're not about kingdom building here jesus is foremost this word is foremost but we can't stay here under the breach we had to come out of denominationalism and god had to change it from from under that that that administration unto a new administration to where it was not denominations and it was not the thoughts of the tables of those churches but god was going to raise a bride and he was going to give her an open book and under the open book it would be a new administration of the son of man of this age and under that spoken word he would bring a bride into existence bringing us from the chicken yard well we realized it might hurt our families but worms just wasn't our diet you know going to church and getting beat on all the time that ain't my dot i don't think this is a place to where you have to get beat every time you walk in i think this is a place to where you want to be inspired motivated encouraged strengthened refilled empowered by the holy ghost to live the life strengthened by the dynamics and the mechanics of the word you what about that what about that person the way they dress or what about that habit in that person's life don't you worry about that we got too many people wanting to clean fish before they ever catch them now i'm i'm personally really i'm really not a fisherman but i am a hunter and i really like to hunt deer and i know one thing you can't skin him till you get him on the ground well brother on that's kind of barbaric okay let me go back to the fishing you can't have fish fillets you can't have fish fillets you can't have fish sticks you can't have fish steaks until you catch them and i'm not really good at catching them you just i catch trees i catch all different kind of things i catch andrew i throw it out whatever comes off but when i get a hulk to one [Music] about two years ago i was standing and i i had something to eat in my hand and one hit my line it had to be a marlin [Applause] all of a sudden i was in a fight for my life we was in water about that deep [Music] but the way that thing was fighting i wasn't going to get it in so the god cut my line i said well it was a marlin i wish but i didn't get to clean him as a matter of fact i didn't get to take a picture with him and a lot of people want to catch christians and make christians out of them before they get out of a bar room i'm preaching to you i went around the circle so i could catch you because i do know how to catch you [Music] are you with me oh but brother on show and so and so and so and so and so and so on so don't worry if jesus ever meets them in their life you can never be the same you'd never be the same once jesus meets you in your life sometimes if we're not careful we'll allow wiggle tails to get into our experience brother brandon explained that to us he said it's because there's no fresh flow no fresh flow of the holy ghost that's more than just having meeting after meeting but that's every day of your life it's brother man uses a term he says how to get closer to god pray and read your bible boy that sounds too simple doesn't it but it is fellowship with god when you pray you know you you ask god to forgive you of your sins well brother on i haven't sinned today really am i preaching to the right audience [Music] your thoughts sound louder in heaven than your words do on earth what about the guy doing 40 miles an hour on 340 and you're behind them and you didn't think something wrong i see people punching each other all over this building right now so what you need is a fresh drink from the king the king wants a fresh drink of pentecostal water that's not that 1900s it's back to the original of acts chapter 2. that's what you saw in process last week of the worship of the lord that's why we have worship warriors here that bring us from walmart from your jobs and bring you into an atmosphere of worship well brother i'm afraid people think we got wildfire you know you know what a stupid devil around the turn of the first of the year people will go i need to get some of this weight off of me christmas has really made me a little bit heavy and for and you realize you can't stay there or or if you get to april you're going to be 40 pounds heavier than what you was in january chapter 1. i'm trying to make something light that's really heavy you got to start somewhere brother ronda i want to i want something deep i am speaking to you something real deep right now you've got to start praying and reading your bible and listening to the tapes and eat the word hey you got to start somewhere you can't stay here you gotta start somewhere so you come to church and you begin to worship and maybe you cannot keep time with your hands but you'll find your way maybe you can't pat your feet because you can't get free but you'll find your way when you begin to think about what jesus has already done for you and start building on it now i'm going i'm going to can i can i preach again next week is it going to be all right so so so let me i'm going to end this i'm going to end this very preliminary if that's all right i am i'm in the 15th year of of the burn but before that i had fell off of a house 40 feet and landed on concrete and that night the doctor said i'd never walk again but before that i'd had two strokes and and laid in the hospital one time eight days couldn't look at the sun couldn't look at lights in the room and i knew god healed me there i knew god healed me in christiansburg i knew god when he came and he touched my body and the doctor told me said son you might as well get the idea that that you'll never walk again i said you don't know who you're talking to [Applause] brother ruben i just simply just spoke right to the doctor you don't know who you're talking to because god did it for me to hear and he did it for him here and he did it for me i got up and i walked out of the hospital that night [Music] now i had back spasms for about a year and all of a sudden i'd lose control of my body i'd fall on the ground and wallow around on the ground i'd fall in my closet and i'd wallow matthew actually picked me up one night drove me to the hospital and when we got to the hospital he pulled in i said i'm okay he don't need me going in there i'm okay but when i left the hospital i had to have him put me in the but i just kept walking i just kept walking and we went and got ice cream remember that we went to jesse's got two hot dogs and got some ice cream you ever had a doctor's visit like that had mustard chili and onions on it connie's telling me to stop but it's walking with god was it was it hollywood i never had a pain in my back ever again no this is real life folks but i got up i be i went right back to chimney sweeping i went that was friday that i fell off of the house on monday i went back to work put a liner in on the monday when did it hurt whoo i got burned i don't remember they tell me and i go by their words of how it was that we came in and looked at the mirror how bad we was burned but by the time i was at the rescue squad they were they were telling me how bad it was they were going to try to get me to the hospital then we go and matthew's in one room i'm in another room and i do remember this homer and thomas came in the room and the doctor asked me i sat on an airplane with me and the doctor asking me he said i'll never forget what you said he said ron do you have any last words and they said i looked over at thomas and homer and said i love you with all my heart and they put me out and a month later i wake up i said a lot of silly things when i woke up they cut my legs off and a lot of other stuff but they were just glad to have me talk my buddy came into the room he said it didn't come to preach your funeral i'll come to pray for you the prayers of the saints have been praying for you i was on a ventilator and i couldn't talk all i could do was move my eyes and they set me up i kept asking him did i lose my teeth i'm still glad i didn't lose my teeth connie came to church we're warriors i've taught my family to be warriors i've taught you as a church to be warriors god takes me home tonight you be warriors you be warriors i i want to say that to you you be warriors he's been with me two and a half years if he takes me tonight don't you look at that as a defeat we're warriors here [Applause] on all i know was there was a two men working on me and the light went out and i saw a lot but it wasn't a light over top of me and that's the last thing i remember for 36 hours and i was brain dead but all i know this is the same one that spoke to lazarus gave me life back again and that's the same one that's spoken to my ears and says you can't stay here you got to move forward all of these battles in my life got me ready for the one that i'm fighting now i am not a coward and neither am i afraid regardless of the reports that are given good or bad because you can get a good report one month and all of a sudden you get a bad report but whose report do we believe and i'm saying all of this is an example for you and we have many here and many on the field and many by the way of internet that are fighting battles that are way beyond even what mortality can handle but jesus is walking with you brother joseph in the trial of your life that you're going through god's walking with you and there's some things you don't understand about this battle but he's with you but you can't stay here you from north carolina that have moved and you've got jobs now you've realized can't stay here but i didn't preach it for that purpose for critics to criticize you but you've realized can't stay here we got to move forward got to do it for our children listen laodicea is not fit to stay in
