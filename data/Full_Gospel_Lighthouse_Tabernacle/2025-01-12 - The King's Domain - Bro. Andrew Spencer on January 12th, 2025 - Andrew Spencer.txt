we have we've handled him amen if you have your Bibles today we' like to look over in the Book of Ecclesiastes chapter 8 Revelations chapter 3 brother Ron sends his greetings to each of you this morning want to appreciate you all for praying for him and was able to see him last night after service and I didn't go bother him this morning but uh he was looking really good last night so so thankful so thankful for that and the progression we just want to continue to remember brother Ron amen how many has a need that you'd like to make known unto the Lord amen we don't ask these things out of tradition but we ask these things because we realize that they we are a very needy people we realize that we are coming before the king of kings in these moments and we realize that he hears our very heart's cry so we don't do this out of tradition but we ask it because we serve a God that sees all things and we are holding fast our confession that he is our high priest and I know that he's able to reach unto the uttermost parts of the world and touch your life in a very special way and that's that's what we want here today is that the king would come and touch us in a very special way I believe today is going to be a very special day in the Lord so let's just let's just bind our hearts together tonight this morning and just just begin to think upon the word of the Lord and ask him to come and minister to us y'all y'all pray for me and I I pray for y'all as well father we come before you Lord Jesus there is truly there is none like you father Lord we come together Lord as your people Lord Jesus Lord once again Lord we have been here we have stood in this place we have read scriptures that we're going to read we have looked over quotes that we are going to read we've done that before but Lord this is a new day in the presence of almighty God things might look the same but what changes is not you Lord things change all the way around us but I pray that you would just come and that the same God would manifest his glory right here at this pull pit and you would just demonstrate your power amongst us as the Church of the Living God you would just touch us in a very special way now God we've lifted up our hands not towards a man but towards all almighty God now Lord I I know that there are congregants that are at home that are streaming that need a touch from you and we ask God that you would be merciful unto them this morning now father as we prepare to get oursel out of the way and to study Thy word we ask God that the author of the word would take position today that you would be both hearer and speaker father that you would receive something from yourself oh God in our vessels Lord that would make us more like you in every way I pray that you would demonstrate who you are through the Church of the Living God today as we yield our vessels to you we are going to be careful to look for you today so we invite you just now to take this service we give you Full O we give you full obedience and as we sacrifice ourself over to you may you just come in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Ecclesiastes chapter 8 and verse 4 says that where the word of a king is there is power and who may say unto him what doest thou Revelations chapter 3 and verse 20 I know that you all are aware of what is taking place in Los Angeles in Hollywood and we have received a a prophet's message in this day that told us that these things would come to pass there are there are believers in that city as well and we know that God is not going to he's not going to allow anything to happen to his children well you say well brother Andrew what about those people there in Los Angeles those Believers will what will happen the same thing that'll happen to you will happen to them we'll be caught up in a moment in the twinkling of an eye it doesn't matter where you are it doesn't matter what country you're from we are serving a God of all lands right so we want to be remembering remember than that we we we love people that we love people it doesn't matter what their name is it doesn't matter their background we love people and so in our hearts it it makes us groan for the coming of the Lord to see these things amen Revelations chapter 3 and verse 20 and we realize that this this book of Revelation has depicted unto us the the thermostat of this age that you and I are living in but in verse 20 it says behold I stand stand at the door and knock not any other age was he standing on the outside but on this age this church world has kicked him out and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sh with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the the spirit saith unto the churches and as you go down to Revelations chapter 4 we realize that the reward that is upon the believer in this generation or upon this church age we realize that the reward is to set upon the throne or set in the Throne of those that overcome the age that is their reward verse verse one of chapter 4 says after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of the trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne if you book if you look in the Book of Daniel you will see there was no one in on the throne then but you see now he has taken possession of that throne and he that set was looked was to look upon as as like Jasper and a Sardis Stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne and inside like unto an emerald and round about The Throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats I saw four and 20 Elders sitting clothed in white rment and they had on their heads crowns of gold may God bless his word you may be seated today in the presence of the Lord by the help of the Lord I'd like to speak to you on a on a subject today on the Kings the the king's domain and we've been on this thought about our our king and the demand of a king for quite some time and we realize that studying out these things that you begin to look throughout history and you will see that Earthly Kings have risen and they have fallen but there is only one king whose Throne is eternal and that's King Jesus Christ that rules in righteousness and in truth and in power and as we read last evening of Zechariah Chapter 14-9 the the Lord shall be king over all the Earth in that day there shall be one Lord and his name one now when you begin to think about this thought of a domain you begin to look at it at a king's domain it refers to a certain a certain geographical area or a a a realm or his territory over which a king begins to exercise his authority his Rule and he governs the people in that land when you look at this a king's domain that King's domain it encompasses both physical lands and it also encompasses the people that are under that King's jurisdiction and you begin to look at it maybe in a broader sense it signifies the influence that that King has it signifies the power that that King has and the responsibility that that King has throughout that entirety of that realm now just to begin to visualize just for a minute a kingdom where where the Kings word is law we live in America where we don't have a king over us but we are under we are under a political reign of a of a president but in in Worlds where there is still kingdoms where kings are still in position that King his word is law you see and when that King begins to make a decree it's written maybe out on a scroll and in in older times you would see it as it would be ritten out in a scroll on a scroll and then that king would take his his ring or his Insignia and he would place his seal upon that scroll now that seal meant something to the people that was carrying that message because they recognized that it wasn't just handed out by a foot soldier but this was something that came from headquarters itself that the Seal of the King was upon this because that seal it marks it it marks his authority it it shows that nobody else gave this word it wasn't it wasn't just somebody down the road this this seal could not be impersonated the seal couldn't be impersonated because the king had this made specifically over his kingdom and over his Reign and each King had a different seal you see that seal it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what what what what man was carrying it but what matters was that the king had placed his seal upon that command and you begin to maybe that scroll could have carried out it could have carried out different commands of it could have been commanding an army to go to such and such place or it could have been carrying out granting Mercy to a person that was in prison it could have been it could have been releasing Justice to to the demographic or the community or the kingship but the power of that decree it was not it was not the the power of it didn't lie upon the parchment of the paper that was on it was not upon the messenger the power was not in the messenger that was carrying at but the very power of that King's decree was the king's word himself it's the word of a king and the Bible said in Isaiah 551 it says so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto I send it you see when God speak there his when God speaks any of his words his word is unmatched in power and authority there's a lot of kings that have talked there's a lot of Kings that have have seals there's a lot of kings that have written down different laws but there's a major difference between an Earthly king and the King of Kings because a man's words will fall but God's words will forever remain to be the same now you and I realize that in this in this age that God has equipped us with a with the most powerful weapon that there ever has been that's ever been placed in the hand of all of humanity God has equipped us with the word of God and that word has changed our lives it's changed our circumstances it's changed our demeanor we realize that the word of God would defeat the defeat the enemy any time any place under any circumstance and the word of a King has the ability to go throughout when he makes a decree it has the ability to set events in motion it has the ability to change lives of of people in that Community whether they Prosper or whether there is more taxation but no matter what that King said that King's word is law you look in the Bible when you see Daniel Daniel was a man of of of man of great stature he was a man that had set up in his heart that he was not going to defile himself with the king's meat or the king's drink and he had built himself up into a position that the king loved him he loved his wisdom he he loved to have his knowledge sitting on his board but the king had made a decree one time that he didn't even realize what he was saying that no man could pray for such and such amount of time and even though he loved Daniel because the king had made a decree that King had to carry out his commission and Daniel had to go to the den of the Lions but Daniel was counting on more than the word of a natural King Daniel was counting on the King of Kings words he didn't know whether he would deliver him or not but God is a god he's a god of lions he's a god of fire he's the god of water hallah Hallelujah you see when the word of a god of our God is given it transforms lives it changes our hearts it's it directs our paths it fulfills all of his Divine will because where the word of a God where the word of a king is there's power behind it this ain't just some man's word this is a word of a king and nobody can o oppose what the King has spoken David said in Psalms 45 and6 thy Throne oh God is forever and ever the scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter when you begin to look and I begin to study out the characteristics of of Earthly King's domain and then you begin to place it together and begin to blend the thoughts of of an Earthly King and and the Heavenly King there are five major uh characteristics that that stand out to me about a domain one of them is territorial Authority protection provision and peace and Order and a king's domain is is is defined to me it's divined it's defined by these aspects of a of a man's territory and it could be talking about his it could be talking about his region it could be talking about his control it could be talking about how much of geography that he has you see and I think it's amazing when you begin to study them things out you begin to see that that natural Kings teritory territory has limitations on it but our King Hallelujah he is infinite and eternal the king's Authority in that domain he has the ultimate authority to be able to make laws enforce laws enforce Justice and he has the authority to govern people under his domain he is that King if it's if it's a characteristic under protection that King is responsible he is responsible for the people that are underneath of his kingdom he is there to make sure that they are safe he is there to make sure that they they have they have their well-being is completely everything everything is in is in order because they are depending on the king that's right you see as a king you see you have set yourself up and there are people that are under you so you've got to be able to provide as a king as well you see you've got to be able to ensure that your kingdom is prospering you got to be sure that the people that their needs are provided for and then the characteristic of a Kingdom's domain is peace in order because what domain really flourishes if there is no peace you be honest you just be real honest you look at the world that we're living in ain't much peace here you see a the the success of a domain is depending upon the heart Harmony and the stability that is placed there under that under that domain now the Bible tells us it's very clear that you and I are going to sit with him on his throne that you and I are going to sit with him on his throne and we realize that when Adam was placed here over 6,000 years ago or when when we see Adam coming into into light in the scripture that Adam was said here and the Bible tells us that the Earth was Adam's domain that Adam had rulership over top of this domain he he controlled the winds he controlled he controlled the waves he controlled the trees he set times and he and he moved things into its position Adam was placed here to rule over the land of this age now brother bandam comes and he preaches in the church ages he said now who who is the God of this Earth he said man is he said that's his domain he said you see everything in the earth is subject to that man he said but through sin's fall you see through the fall of Man you see he be begin to get subject to sin he said but through Christ redeeming power he comes back again because the Earth belongs to man it was given to him that he would be ruler over everything now you know Eve stepped into position under Adam's headship and she recognized that Adam had some boundaries that he could move things into position you see a queen knows as her position that her King has andc the boundaries of his domain if he wants more land he just goes out and he fights for that land Hallelujah that Queen knows her position she knows her kingship boundaries she knows where he has where he's got limitations and where his jurisdiction runs to now brother brandham says some very powerful things and how can I overcome about the believer's domain he said notice when he says in Revelations chap 20 through 22 he said now he he Hallelujah the Overcomer will sit with me not on my throne but in my Throne because a king's domain he said it reaches from this side of this boundary to this boundary he said but a but this king's boundary he said it reaches from eternity to Eternity he said Christ is the ruler the ruler at this time he is the complete domain of almighty God but he says the church will be with him the bride will be with him in his throne throughout the entirety of his domain I'll say this as a queen you know that John 14:12 still exists as a queen you know that John 15:7 still is in action as a queen as a church in action you know that Mark 16 is still under your domain that's right Hallelujah David's domain David ruled over Israel and Judah David's domain was established and expanded by almighty God blessing him and protecting him and governing him Solomon's domain was marked by peace and prosperity and the wisdom that almighty God gave him you can look at the Pharaohs of Egypt that they their ruled no matter what their name was no matter what their background that their rule was over top of the land of Egypt that was their domain they they centered thems around the Nile River and their domain was characterized by architectural pyramids and and things that are still lasting even in this hour you look at King Nebuchadnezzar and you could see that his domain was was there in Babylon and Babylon is is shown as one of the most prosperous kingdoms that ever was it stretched all the way from Babylon all the way to Mesopotamia all the way to the Far East but you find in Daniel 4 and verse 22 it says about Nebuchadnezzar talking about the dream it said is this it is thou oh King that thou art grown notice word grown and become strong for thy greatness is grown and reaches unto heaven and thy Dominion to the end of the Earth you go on reading the final verses of Daniel chapter 4 it talks about Nebuchadnezzar's domain it talks about it had reached so high that it was guiding all the way up to heaven but you see that if you go on reading that God begin to cut down Nebuchadnezzar's Throne he be to cut down his kingdom this was a kingdom that was flourishing this was a domain that was known throughout all the worlds but God hallelujah he sets times and he sets Kings he raises them up and he sets them down and Nebuchadnezzar was cut down and hued like a tree Nebuchadnezzar set out decrees he set out different laws but this was not the law when Daniel was speaking he said this was a decree from the most high Daniel saying it ain't my word Daniel saying this ain't some King's word this is the most High's word I'm going keep building today I could tell you about many Earthly Kings I could tell you about Charlamagne that was over top of the Holy Roman Empire I could tell you I could tell you about King Henry VII that was over top of the England domain I could tell you about gask Khan that was over top of the Mongol Empire I could tell you about King Louis the 14th about how he was over top of the over the top of the domain of of France and how that how that he ruled throughout his throughout his entirety as a king you see it reaches their domain reaches as far as they set the boundaries I could tell you all about these i' I've spent some time studying them out but the greatest thing the greatest point that stood out to me yes they had Authority yes they had rulership but their domain was limited to geographically it was they limited to how many boundaries they could set it was limited to a certain time as long as they were King their laws stood in place but when that king passed off the scene the decrees begin to change but this King my King has running from eternity to Eternity he has no limit a his power never ceases he has the ability to heal you today and heal you tomorrow he has the ability to save you and keep you he has the ability as a king to set things in motion it's quite the contrast between a natural King and an Earthly king and a Heavenly King now Jesus said this behold the kingdom of God is within you now I want you to be listening very closely and I want you to be on the edge of your seat as it were I'm going to just build some things because I'm going somewhere and I want you ready so do I have your full attention because God did not just deposit this message to us just to just give us another form or just give us another religion God deposited this to us and he released these very very special revelations in this hour because he realized that his domain it was running it was running right up to Le oosa it had went through seven Church ages and Church agents had dismissed him there through men of that coming in of creed they had dismiss dismissed the Holy Spirit from operating amongst the Church of the Living God they had dismissed the idea that God still did Miracles and that God still did Divine healings and that God still was the same but in this generation God has brought back into full picture that all the things that had been dismissed all the things that had been broken apart all the things that men begin to say this wasn't these King's word all of a sudden a little Kentucky hillbilly begin to put these things back into order and said this is the King's word I know men have rejected the messenger I know they have rejected the seal but the hillbilly Kentucky put the king's word back in its position the kingdom of God is within you now when brother Brandon Begin to teach us in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he begin to teach us he begin to lay in some very very powerful things and you ain't listened to it for a while go back and listen to it if you want to know anything about my Ministry it's spend in them four hours right there and brother Bon begins to lay lay in some things there about the threefold purpose of almighty God he goes in there and he starts talking about Born Again Believers that are born into the kingdom of almighty God and he goes in there and he lays out that first Christ is his purpose his first purpose was to express himself completely God in Christ so he's going to reveal himself through the form of the son of man of Luke 17 and3 of Revelations 10 Malachi 4 secondly he was going to have the preeminence by his church so he was going to literally his bride was going to literally become the Living Word they would be the voice of this message they would be live voices that's why William Brandon would stand there in the Revelation series and said oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands thousands of live voices not just a voice that'll fall off the map not just a voice that I'll speak today and won't speak tomorrow we need live voices he said that's the Thunder that shakes the devil that's the preeminence of Christ Living on the inside of a body of Believers his third purpose was to restore the kingdom back to its rightful position what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying that in this three-fold purpose is where God is changing our mind changing our life and one of these days he'll change our [Applause] bodies Hallelujah I want to turn loose a preacher but let me let me keep going brother M say in there he said now our headship is a kingdom our headship is a kingdom he said the kingdom of God is within you he said we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in your own life and bringing to promise bringing to pass every promise in this day you see he's making the headship and the body completely redeemed to bring about the message of the last day this was not just placed on Malachi 4 but the headship the kingdom is within you so the headship has now got a body that it can rest him it's now got a body it can move in it's now got a body he can work in it's now got a body he can live in the Kingdom the kingdom the kingdom is here to bring a [Music] message Adam rolled the natural he controlled winds he controlled trees but in this Hallelujah in this hour it's okay if I turn him loose just for a minute but in this hour Eve fell Eve fell back there in the Garden of Eden but right here in Satan's Eden there is a counterpart to the king and her domain reaches to Eternity that's why she has the ability to say to complexes you've got to go in the name of Jesus Christ this is your domain this is your power a King when he says something he means something he's got power to back it up he isn't just making vain promises he's not making empty promises to us that he can't keep so he said he' give you the Holy Ghost well receive receive it brother Melvin the thing you've been looking for it's all over you buddy the thing you've been looking for is right here in this room a lot of people are looking for miracles but it's right here in the room a lot of people are looking for deliverances but it's right here in the room how can you say that because the king said it May Hallelujah I feel better I can't have no constriction on me it just let's go back to our text in Revelation chapter 4 brother brandom refers to this in Revelations chapter 4 and part two it just happened this past week believe it's 65 years or 64 years or on Friday it would have been 64 years that when William brandham gets done finishing preaching the Revelation series that the pillar of fire begins to draw out begins to draw out the seven Church ages according to how brother Brandon has draw it out and brother brandom goes in here excuse me for dropping that in he said but he said now look he said to look upon a Sardis stone and a jasper stone he said he was sitting on his throne I read this to you last weekend but I'd like to build on it today he said how would you all like to see him setting upon his glory he said now let's run let's turn over to Revelations 21-1 and he goes there and he said he carried me away the spirit to a great and high mountain showed me the great City and the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God he said having the glory of God having the glory of God and her lights was lik UN to a stone most precious even like Jasper as clear as Crystal notice he goes on he said now her light the light who is the light he said and the city had no need of the sun because the lamb is a light thereof he said Jasper s a stone he said now notice he said the glory of God is Jesus Christ and the glory of Jesus Christ is his church now when you begin to look at John throughout the entirety of the Book of Revelation you will find that John represents a the bride body that that one person in a vision can represent many many many members there but John is representing the he is representing the Bride of Jesus Christ and we realize that that from Revelations chapter 4 to Revelations 19 that the church has been caught up that the church is already gone on but we realize that when you start reading Revelations chapter 4 you will see there you begin to see the appearance of fire you begin to see the rainbow and the seven colors round about The Throne that the Bible said and the color of amber as the appearance of fire about it and the appearance from appearance of his loins even upward and appearance of his loin even downward I saw as it was the appearance of fire you begin to look at the fire of the Holy Ghost spraying out it was spraying out the Revelation or the the rainbow of the seven colors you see them seven colors have a have significance in it they're laying in there now brother random goes there he said now the glory of the Lord he said the glory of the Lord is covering over his church because he is in his church the glory of the Lord is covering over his church because he is in his church the kingdom of God is within you he said this was the appearance the appearance and the likeness of the glory of the Lord now what happened out there in 1950 at the Houston Coliseum we begin to recognize that the pillar of fire begin to whip in this generation and it begin to show up that it wasn't it wasn't just a man but there was a Vindication that was behind this man that all of heaven was behind this ministry and it was showing that Revelations 10:1 cared enough to come over top of Revelations 10:7 and he begin to show that the pillar of fire had made its return again now when William brandham is standing there in Lakeport California I believe it's 1960 and he begins to preach and he he begins to lay out some things and the pillar fire begins to show up in the room there's a photographer that is sitting there and he said and the Holy Spirit my brother Manon was he he didn't want pictures being taken while he was ministering because he was looking for that light but something spoke to that photographer said take a picture take the picture and he snapped one picture and then he snapped another picture and there you begin to see the very Throne of God as it set out there you see the seven licks of fire you begin to see it brother brandom said now we've got it in codak Chrome he said you see the streaks of rainbow they're going back and forth you see the bride is covered by the glory of the Lord the bride is covered by the glory of the Lord You See Jesus Christ is the glory of God but the glory of Jesus Christ is his church and this church has been covered by the glory of almighty God it don't surprise me that you see the pillar of fire in this meeting it won't surprise me whether you see the Holy Ghost whipping in here we ought expect to see them thanks I'll be honest the king's here so we might as well expect to see him you remember that little bitty girl out there that was waving her flag and she got to cry because the king didn't see her well you ain't got to worry whether the king sees you or King don't King Jesus has always been looking on you he said he never leave you and he never forsake you now I I sitting back here in the study and I I was reading over these things and maybe brother Matthew Spencer would come here not that you anybody could have done this I could have done it with that other microphone on but anyways we realize that this is this is from Life Magazine it wasn't in Time Magazine cuz there ain't no time limits on our King it was in Life Magazine we realized that brother Brandon was up there and he he he's given a word from the Lord to go out west and to go out there and you remember the you remember the promise when brother Brandon was standing there in 1962 and he begins to preach s is is the sign of the end and brother Bram goes out there and brother Bram says now he said he speaks to the men that were with him he begins to tell them now them angels are up here waiting on me now brother bam goes up there and they're hunting them Haven a Hogs and you remember that brother bandam is standing there and he and all of a sudden he hears a great blast while he while he's he's picking that cuar off of his leg brother BR thought he was shot that somebody shot him and all of a sudden there were seven angels that coming from the sky and they gave him a revelation to go back east and to preach the Seven Seals now brother manam he he he doesn't realize this I believe it's in uh it is the rising of the sun I believe I believe that's right that he begins to talk about this this uh this addition here in in Life Magazine brother brandom don't even know whether it's there and brother brandham is sitting there and he's looking at it and he's he's he's coning over the he's pondering over these things that he begins to look at it and the spirit of the Lord tells him to turn it to the right he said you see it's our Lord Jesus Christ up there looking over top of the land you see our King is looking over top of you now if you go you read Revelations chapter 10 you throw that up there for us uh sister Alysa glasses ain't on Revelations chapter 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head now the author of this magazine was not a message believer the guy that took that picture was not a message believer but if you look on the next page you will see the rainbow of moon beams that is over top of the head if you go back one more page you will see that there is a picture of five watches and the description says five young ladies who are never late Hallelujah There is five wise virgins that will be right on time they have met and heard the bridegroom's call the message of the hour and has shouted over top of them and they recognized this is a king's message this is life this ain't time this is life how can you put time on you as eternity to Eternity now we realize that the Book of Revelation is in symbols is that right thank you brother Matthew it's in symbols so we realize we realize that that's just a symbol that ain't our Lord up there it is our lord it's a symbol of him in the heaven but to realize that he's come and they Fe he's coming A Spiritual manifestation of the Bride coming of Jesus Christ in this hour that the queen has the authority it has the authority of the king's seal you said well I don't know if I got it or not let me tell you that seal that you got on your life it proves whether you got it or not you come up against Satan that seal will prove whether you got it or not you come up against sickness that seal will prove whether you got it or not there's a lot of things that happen to good people but because the king seal is there Satan can never take your life he talked to job job he took everything from job he whipped him he put him he put him he put him through the trials of his life he took his children he took his manifest he took his success he took all of it away from him but he told him you can't touch his life come on somebody what are you at the end of the day you're the same person you was when you was born here but something's changing on the outside of you the natural man's changing but there is a genan Sheed of God that was deposited in you before the foundation of the world that no preacher put it there no Doctrine put it there but almighty God so life that's why Paul could say in Galatians 2 and 20 that I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ it will not surprise me if you walk out of the service and say you've seen the pillar of fire it won't surprise me one bit it won't surprise me one bit if you begin to see the Milky presence of almighty God begin to float in this place I've seen it many times I saw it right when Sister Sarah and sister jolia was singing and some people was in a different world but all of a sudden the Milky presence of almighty God just begin to drop in here it won't surprise me because William Brandon would stand there he would stand there and he'd be talking to a patient in a line he began to talk to him he said now he he would call out certain needs and certain diseases and certain things he said now you're being covered over by the pillar fire he said now standing between standing between me and the patient is the Angel of the Lord you realize that that that that you are the reason why this world cannot be destroyed you're the reason why the tribulation is being held off it's because your mercy to this generation you see the glory of the Lord is standing between between Le oia and judgment brother Brandon would tell us he said the first Throne was in heaven the Judgment seat he said but the second Throne was in Christ he said but now the third Throne is in man so you are literally The Mercy Seat to this dying generation and people don't even realize when you go to work with him and when you go to Walmart and when go through your day-to-day activities they do not realize how close they are to the throne of almighty God because you are you are a body word you are covered by the bleeding word and the mercy seat is in plain view people I was me and Aden was on uh we was where were we we've been so many places he he likes to stay home but I take him places he looks at me when I ask him can you go with me here and you know you know i' go with you anywhere brother Andrew but I'd rather be here we was in uh we was in Tennessee we had standing there and we we're doing some window shopping while the girls were doing real shopping and uh it's real buddy Hallelujah them girls it doesn't matter if it's Black Friday or any Friday we standing there and all of a sudden this Pentecostal preacher comes up he starts talking starts talking to us and what I found amazing I don't even remember the whole context of the of our conversation but he he put his hand on brother alen and said he said people don't realize he said' the church ain't a building he said but the church is in you and I thought brother here he was and I mean I'll just be honest with you he looked like a pervert come straight from the pits of hell I don't care if it's Pentecost or not that's what he looked like had a chain running down his neck and had his hairs hanging out and he cared more about his appearance than he did care about the Church of God and I thought when he put his hand on brother Al and said the Church of God is in you I thought buddy you as as close as you ever going to get right here you as close to the I tell you brother Joe shifflet had a say in many times he would always say he said he would talk to doctors and he would say he said you know he said I'm the most important person you're going to meet today you're the mo I'm the most important you don't even realize sometimes what people are bumping up against what makes them what makes you jump and makes you shout they don't realize that they're bumping up to Mercy but you realize that you're bumping up to Angels you're bumping up to Eternity and it changes your whole demeanor brother random comes an anointed one at at the end time brother Manon begins to connect and lay some things together about the third pole and he connects Luke 17:30 Revelations 10 and Malachi 4 and it begins to connect them things together he begin to tell us that all of it was tied together that all of it was tied together all of it of the son of man Malachi 4 that he was Christ and he's going to be in you and I'm going to send you Elijah so he is sending us Elijah Christ is here so there's got to be a youu here right there's got to be a people of the third pole because it wasn't just for William brandom come on I'll say it like this it wasn't just for Hatty R and it wasn't just for that storm out there in col Colorado and it wasn't just for sister M tumors but it was for you come on somebody it wasn't just to speak squirrels into existence but it was to Speak Life to Sisters Whitney's womb it was Speak Life to brother Davey's crushed hips it was to Speak Life to brother Ron when he was burned in a c in a in a burn center that third pole is in action so the word of the Lord is in her it ain't no longer in the hands of just William banham it ain't just in the hands of the mighty Angel but it's in your hand I'm not just talking about a king but I'm talking about the king this ain't just a king sword this is the king sword Paul said in 1 Corinthians 4:20 the kingdom of God is is is not in word but it's in power brother Randon picks that up in the message Oneness he said the kingdom of God is God's word made Power the kingdom of God is God's word made Power what is the kingdom of God it's within you the Kingdom's in you and when the word comes in there what does this word begin he said it turns itself into Power well glory to God sometimes you just don't need a miror but sometimes you do sometimes you ain't got no money in your wallet and sometimes you do brother Mar I'm said now if I really needed that old Barlo knife even though I know it's setting up there on that cabinet back at home he said if I really needed it he said I could believe in it be right there in my pocket in a matter of seconds what are you saying I'm saying that faith is the word that faith is a revelation of what the word is and Faith turns the word into Power what was had R doing was lining herself up with the word and it became Power to her and it released salvation to her little boys it turns itself into Power making it say exactly what it said so a king's word has got to remain a king's word to remain to have power behind it now go back to the message I preached on Veil Glory you see that Veil of the Holy Ghost it was working it was working in one man but now it's working that Holy Ghost is now operating it was there on the day of Pentecost but now it was working in Acts three you see what did they do they turned the word of Luke 24:49 and he turned it into power when he was up there waiting on that promise because the king had told him that this was coming and the King told him to be at such and such place and it was going to happen that way I say this that the king had spoke that this is the way the things are to be he begin to talk to us if the Rapture is at hand and there modern events that are made clear by prophecy he begin to talk to us about communion he be to talk to us about spiritual food in due season and the King started talking who is this MDC he began to talk to us about he began to talk to us about countdown he began to talk to us about the Masterpiece you begin to see that God was hid and he was revealed in them titles that was preached by William brandham and you begin to see Christ is a mystery of God revealed you what is it's a bride that is turning this word into power just like after the day of Pentecost Peter and John walked up there and they was walking by the beautiful gate there laid a man that was sitting there for so many years but when they walk by there they turned word into power and such as that said such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ why walk walk I say this to you as such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ you need your pocket bll fold your pocket bill fold up filled up then I say step in line for it if you need a body change step in line for it if you need restoration step in line for it if you need healing step in line for it turn word into Power come on now William brandham said we've got enough power he but what we need is to stop blowing the power at the top and put the wheels in action let him roll let him roll let him roll don't talk about it put it into action the king's word the king sword what's in your hand what are you going to do with it somebody going to speak something into existence it's where eagles are born right here in the atmosphere like this somebody's going to speak something to existence so what do you keep preaching about them prodical for because I believe somebody's going to speak it into existence I believe that God didn't put it on my heart to keep preaching it just for no reason I believe somebody's going to take that into action it ain't going to just be Hatty R story it'll be Denny Vance's story it'll be chasty Fraser story come on somebody how about you you're going to start talking some things when the bride gets into speak condition with her condition with her High her High King her bridegroom then all of a sudden you begin to watch there ain't no difference no more the two have become one they're saying the same thing that the king spoke what the king saw they're manifesting Joshua and his commission was go out there and possess the land he go out there and possess the land he laid out the boundaries laid out the borders he began to lay out that this was his domain this was the believer's domain that's why Caleb could stand there at 85 years old he said I'm as strong as I ever was and he would standing there said give me my Mountain Caleb didn't care whether there was anakims on there whether they was living on his property or whether they was living on his domain he recognized that was his promise that came from a prophet messenger and stood there and told him that these things were his so he recognized it was time for him to go in there and defend his borders we have a land without boundaries we got to fight for our boundaries Brothers I'm telling you you got to fight for your prayer life you got to fight for your home you got to fight for your wife you got to fight for your children I say secure the boundaries secure the boundaries Brothers what are you saying I'm saying put the token on display because God has given us a commission and he's places here in this generation I say give me my Mountain we realize that Christ in the true church is going to be a continuation of the book of Acts and Satan hates that book he hates the Book of Genesis he hates the Book of Revelation but in there I find my true identity as a Queen of Heaven he knows that if the people it's based on a little word if if if you believe if you accept it if you confess it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the Antichrist Spirit working in the frame framework of the church that he will be defeated but you'll be an invincible Army that means that you're uncapable of being defeated I'm talking about little bitty Housewives being Invincible I'm talking about grandma's being Invincible I'm talking about little bitty children being Invincible I'm talking about people that believe because if he didn't put no age requirements on it he didn't say how old you got to be he didn't say how mature you got to be he said but if thou believest all things are possible hallelujah our King has left nothing undone he's turned over every stone of Revelation in this hour he's given you power he's given you Revelation he's given you Authority and you are placed here not to be ruled by Satan but to rule over Satan with me you go to reading Joshua the Book of Joshua you begin to read in Joshua chapter 12 that Joshua goes in there and he starts lining out the name of these Kings I I ain't going to spend much time right there but he starts lining out all the kings that they went in there and they took back their domain maybe I'll grab that at some of time but I'm not going to spend much time right there but Joshua knew that if he was going to have total Victory he was going to have to have a total surrender from everybody look at the Battle AI look where they begin to get in trouble with W with the with the golden wedge and it begin to get grab a hold of that that Babylonian garment it got him in trouble so you before you're going to have total Victory you got to have a total surrender let me let me just drop that right there before you can ever be successful as the Queen of Heaven you have got to surrender your will and your ways over to him before you ever be a successful housewife you got to be a submissive housewife I don't mean you Brothers run over top of them but before you ever before you're ever going to grow in the presence of the Lord you've got to surrender you ever watch somebody's got a that man they can flat sing the dog down I mean they can just they can sing you happy and they can they can may I tell you what they make you cry sometimes some some people make you cry all the time when they sing you know sometimes we're a blessing to them sometimes they're a blessing to us when they're when we're a blessing to them it's when we're letting them sing but there's some people that can flat sing it down I mean they can they can make you boohoo and cry and run mascara all over your face because man they just got the talent but until they surrender that until they surrender that gift to almighty God they will never fully realize what the anointing of God truly is but you watch somebody that maybe can't even carry a tune in a in a bucket and they can't hardly make their way out of a paper bag and all of a sudden they just get to they get to sing and all of a sudden the angels of God get involved and they take that they take that realm up to another they take it up to another octave and all of a sudden the blessings of God come down you don't care whether they can sing or not what matters is they surrender their gift to almighty God you see it's kind of let me let me place it in this view for you it's kind of like when we had that play up here and everybody everybody got I called everybody out and everybody was getting their accolades and they was getting rewards you see there were certain you see there's there there's some people that live for that moment right there they live for that moment right there they they they they are waiting on that moment of recognition where people recognize him and they they called out their name and man it felt good when when you know when you know you just you fell in line to it and you were just you were there but you there are people that that are looking for those accolades and they're looking for their rewards but they never put in the time to learn out their lines and they never put in the time to to make them themselves accountable unto under the work of the Lord you see a lot of people like rewards but they never want to show up so I'm saying this to you if you want some rewards if you want to set on his throne you got to show up you got to put in a time it ain't just brother Ron's job it ain't just brother mcclaren's job it ain't just brother Bor Leon's job you got to put it in time if we're going to defeat Satan right here in his Eden then we've got to put in a time that was free brother I I I was reading this last night I got home and I was reading over some notes and brother maram started talking about Stephen he said he's a man full of the Holy Ghost I don't know if this fits here or not but I'm going to say it he said but he said man Steph was a man full of the Holy Ghost he said you couldn't put him out on the house he was like like a house on fire on a windy day he stood out there and he wasn't a preacher he was a deacon he stood out there and he was living his life and he was teaching all of them and he was telling them all about taking them all the way from David all the way to Jesus Christ and took him out there and brother BR I found this amazing is brother Bram said to he he said now he said he said domain runs from eternity to Eternity he said but when a man sits down he said that means he's finished his work and Jesus sat down on the right hand on the right hand of God he was sitting there and all of a sudden brother man said that that because Sten was such a man he said almighty God brush back the skies he said it must have been something Steven must have really meant something to him so he stood up so he stood up and he said he welcome stepen back home I say this I'll say that the King of Kings one of these days is going to stand up and it's going to come for his bride you must mean something very powerful to him so he stands up from his finished work one of these days is's going going to roll back to the skies and he's going to come and catch you no I ain't talking about I ain't talking about thr at the world she's a Rapture ass I'm talking about right now I'm talking about right now he's rolling back the Skies over your life he's rolling them back and saying you're worthy you're worthy because in this hour the lamb stood up not in Paul not in Paul's day not in Luther's day not in Wesley's day but in this day the lamb stood up let me drive this our King has power he's got power over physical ailments he's got power over the natural world he can turn water into wine he can walk on water he can feed 5,000 our King has power over death proving it when he raised Jar's daughter he proved it when he raised Lazarus from the grave he proved it when he raised the Widow of Na's son he has the power over the supernatural when he would cast demons out by laying hands on them he has the power he has power over the supernatural when he spoke to Legion he has the power over the supernatural when the boy that came to him that was thrown into the fire by that demon that epileptic boy that demon had to recognize when it come to them disciples he seen that there was no there was no real surrender there but when he come to Jesus he saw there was an anointing there there was a power there there was a life there the Bible said in Romans 14-1 17 that the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but it's righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost it ain't just natural things it ain't just going to church but it's about having the power it's about having righteousness it's about having peace on Monday and Joy on Tuesday it's talking about having the Holy Ghost throughout all the entirety of your life and if you're going to be a king if you're going to be a king like the Bible said he hath made us Kings yeah the major difference between King David and King Saul was Saul was willing to let things live he was willing to let things live so he let King AAG the king of the amalekites he let him live instead of putting things to death that should have been put to death the major difference between him and David was that David was not going to allow any Philistine or any Amite to stand there in a god place in the position of God's word so Saul didn't reverence the king's word you study out your demons you study them out you know how they come to you you watch somebody's got a lust devil you study out you know when it's coming you know you got somebody that's got a got a jealous Spirit on them you know when it's coming you watch somebody that's got maybe a pornographic devil on them they know when it's coming you study them out and Amite you begin to study out an amit's movements throughout the Bible that Amite I know I ain't saying that right the Amite he's persistent he's a sneaky little booger but he's a very distructive Force I'll tell you what an amot does an amot will come in behind you he'll sneaking behind you and he'll steal your joy away he'll steal your health away he'll steal your family away he steal your wife away why because Saul Let Him Live Saul let him live but you look back over and and I believe it's numbers or Exodus 17 that you'll see that that that Moses wasn't going to allow any of them amenites to live and God wasn't going to let him live so he seen that as long as as long as Moses's hands were held up that they that they Israel begin to win the war but when he let down his hands he let down his hands then the amates be to win and wage war over top of Israel so there were some faithful brothers and sisters that got around the message of the hour and they began to lift it back up into place and all of a sudden all of a sudden they begin to wage war and they begin to win the war and you'll find out that Israel won the battle because Moses's hands were hung up and they wasn't going to fall down well Jesus thought so much of you that on the day on on the day that he was crucified he let the Roman soldiers pierce his hands up on the cross because he didn't want you to go down and defeat he held his hands up there and said as long as I got my hands up they're going to win this war what am I saying don't be AA kill AAG you see what happened the prophet had to come back in line to the king's word and step step right in there to finish what Saul refused to do don't be a Saul be a David kill that King kill King complex kill King stigma kill King fear kill King doubt kill it kill it go to Joshua 10 go to Joshua 12 go read it all 31 Kings look over their domain but Joshua was not willing that the King AI would live 36 men died that day in AI this ain't never happened before what's wrong what happened something maybe Joshua was lost his anointing but while they was down there in Jericho and they got to looking at the enticements of the world they started letting some things live and they didn't recognize the king's word they didn't recognize so they started they started bringing in some things I say this it's time to kill King doubt it's time to kill that Amite spirit it's time to kill AAG it's time to stop listening to the blading of of the goats and the Lambs out there and it's time to start it's time to start dealing it's time to start dealing with them things that the prophet told you to deal with well come on somebody well we don't have Wednesday night service and I ain't missing church on Wednesday night listening to who loves Serv Susie neither am I we won't have church on Wednesday I find it amazing and people can't get to the house of God I'm preaching backwards now because they want to let things live they enjoy living with King AAG they enjoy living with their addictions and their habits and well I'll just be okay I'll just be okay I'll just I'll just make it through I I'll just stream the services now I know people are sick right now and they they're having a stream but I I I want to ask these full-time streamers these full-time streamers is God going to Rapture us through a stream let's ask these full-time streamers do you get the really delivered do you have the ability for a pastor to come and lay his hands on you and cast out that King AAG I say the king's word still in action and the King's word said that we'll not forsake the assembling of ourselves as we see the day approaching I say King King King Jesus I know you hear me when I [Applause] pray it's time you start killing the complexes of what you heard about you and what mockers are saying about you I don't

musicians come [Applause] on what are you saying I'm saying you're a king well man we was real high brother Andrew he brought us there got a little sticky a little bit if you want to have some victory you got to go through some ditches sometime you got to clear some ditches out let the Holy Ghost take that the holy ghost that bulldozer of the Holy Ghost go down through your ten Can Alley and start pushing out this log and pushing out that log and pushing out that sin and pushing out that complex pushing out that nightmare pushing out that fear you see where did Abraham meet MDC after the slaughter of Kings but there's something major difference between Abraham and lot Abraham was changed and lot had to look back on the fires and see all the things destructed I'm saying be a five wise don't be five foolish I'm saying kill every one of them Devils that come in there to try to steal away your joy and steal away your peace and steal away your family I say kill them all I ain't talking about people I'm talking about the spirit behind it somebody keeps giving you drama get rid of that Spirit somebody keeps giving you jealousy and you get worked up because because that preacher's preacher and that singer's singer and that one's playing the music get rid of that devil get rid of that squash that thing I don't I don't care if an evangelist comes all the way from timbuck Two and gets you saved and get you filled let's go home I don't care if this one sings and the anointing comes or that one sings As long as he comes I say the king's here that's right I say he's here I say he's here in power I say he's here in demonstration I say he's here I say he's worth worshiping me and brother Matthew Mard was out in Oklahoma and we we was out there preaching a a youth meeting and but Matthew was there we come down last service man that meeting was just powerful just powerful I'll be honest that's the thickest I've ever seen it be honest it's is the thickest I've ever seen the presence of the Lord and I believe you could attest to it and your wife and it was so physical but it reminded me when the prophet was over in that foreign country and then people was packing their idols and they started throwing down their Idols brother brand said it was such a dust cloud that raised up it reminded me that when people start throwing down idols and throwing down all these things that holding them back all of a sudden the presence of God come down I know Satan will try to block you Vision with with clouds of doubt and clouds of fear but why don't you let the presence of the Lord just drop in your heart it's something very powerful when you go to talking about the Lord he'll he'll come I was talking about this same instance just a few weeks ago I was riding around with some boys in Florida it invited me to go on a Gator hunt and I was down there and they were just talking about the presence of the Lord and all of a sudden I wasn't going to say this but I I just feel I just feel it would bless you I we was just talking about that same event it was that event that changed your life right and we just riding in the car we talk about it because I had prayed if if God wanted me to go do this I don't go to Every invitation but a gator hunt was pretty cool and uh I was I was uh we was just talking about that I was talking about this instance about the presence of the Lord being that thinki and just start talking I found that when you start talking about the king it begins to show his glory that's why don't surprise me if you you sit here and you see a flicker l or you see a you see like a star just kind of go through the room I've seen him multiple times here this morning it doesn't changed one thing about whether I see it or whether I don't I know he's here because his word says he's here but we started talking about it right here in the car we starts talking about these Supernatural events and I look over at the brother and he all of a sudden that that he was just moved by the presence of the Lord and you could see you could see like every fiber of his being was on fire of the Holy Ghost and we had prayed for a super it was like a sonic boom went off in my ear and all of a sudden the presence of the Lord was just sitting right there now I said that to say this is that when you start talking about a king a king begins to take the throne room of your heart it begins to manifest his glory I believe it was uh brother he ain't sitting up here brother Gavin wherever he's at he in he in this he's in this same building and brother Wayne Lawson was ministering and all of a sudden the pillar fire showed up he I believe he said that that service was real scary daddy something like that he said well why was it scary he said because that fire that fire well that same service there was people that was sitting in the back that had saw that same Pillar of Fire it's a mouth of two three Witnesses one time me and Katie was riding home and I told her I I told her we we was coming around and I I'm just I'm sorry if you think I'm trying to talk I'm just real sorry don't don't think that please don't think that we was just riding home and I told Katie I said now I said uh the the Lord's real near right now she well how you know I said I I see him following us about that time all of a sudden it run right in front of us that light went right in front of us I I want you to no this that you see see what's going on in Los Angeles and you see what's going on in the Vatican and you see what's going on with this bride everything is in his position for the king to come because you can have all the Banquets you can Esther can set the Banquets for for hmon and the King ah yes sir yes sir it's time you have a banquet for your enemy it's time you kill your enemy it's time you start telling the king what what he's tried to do to you and what he's tried to say about you and put fear back on you and give that complex back to you it's time you set a banquet for him and said this is your last day invite the king invite the pillar of fire invite the Holy Ghost invite King Jesus Oh want you hear me when I pray how many wants to love him today Hallelujah I don't went too far I don't mean I don't mean in his word we never get too much of that I don't went too far but I want you to know my king ain't got no jurisdiction where his limits are his limits are held back I want you to know no matter how far you are it doesn't matter if he's king shepherd he'll go to a pit to pick you up it doesn't matter how far and deep in sin you are he's King Jesus and he'll go to the worst Satan's got his jurisdiction and it can only go this far that's why brother Ron stopped that jurisdiction of that devil just a few days ago upon the skin of your life all of a sudden he cursed that enemy said Satan I curse you in the name of Jesus Christ what happened in your life when the ministry of Malachi 4 came by all of a sudden the jurisdiction was stopped Satan has no hold in your mind he has no hold in your spirit so he has no hold in your soul as a born again son and daughter of God release release yourself oh you want to worship him for a
