[12:58] up in prayer about a year ago that's
[13:00] when she actually started recognizing
[13:03] the message and kind of listening into
[13:05] it and became interested and I'm
[13:07] believing that God has a bigger purpose
[13:08] even behind this entire test and I
[13:10] believe Satan's just trying to come in
[13:12] and throw it throw a trick it's a trick
[13:14] of the enemy as she started getting in
[13:16] tune and she listens to brother Ron a
[13:18] whole lot just for encouragement today
[13:20] is actually her birthday and she found
[13:22] out Friday that she was now diagnosed
[13:25] with brain and all the all the
[13:26] conditions there but we know that's just
[13:28] a demon from hell and we know the god
[13:30] that's the power over top of that let's
[13:32] just bow our heads and take these needs
[13:33] to the Lord
[13:35] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just we
[13:37] thank you so much for what you've done
[13:39] for us and we thank you so much for the
[13:41] visitations across this entire building

[13:47] man at work but that was you at work
[13:49] Lord and and Lord Jesus you came and
[13:51] your your message is Anointed because we
[13:54] know that you are the word and you come
[13:56] and make your word known and make it
[13:57] flesh and Lord Jesus if if we were not
[14:01] to speak if we were not to cry out the
[14:02] Rocks would cry out Lord but
[14:04] but you've placed a voice inside of us
[14:07] and we know there's we know there's
[14:08] power behind the tongue and and whether
[14:10] we whether we speak positivity or
[14:12] whether we speak negativity in our into
[14:15] our lives that's exactly what what
[14:16] fruits will be produced and Lord Jesus
[14:19] we are speaking we are speaking
[14:20] positivity this morning we are speaking
[14:22] healing into lives we see all the prayer
[14:25] requests that have been brought forward
[14:26] this morning and Lord Jesus I'm just I'm
[14:28] thanking you in advance because I know
[14:30] the power of the god that I serve and I
[14:33] have the faith that each and every one
[14:34] of these prayer requests that's been
[14:36] made known whether it's a whether it's a
[14:38] sickness whether it's a death sentence
[14:39] over someone's life is you could come in
[14:42] and just a sweep of a moment and wipe
[14:43] every wipe every cancerous cell out you
[14:46] can wipe every anxiety every depression
[14:48] spirit
[14:49] you can wipe everything that we are
[14:51] fighting away Lord Jesus we we each have
[14:53] our own personal battles that the person
[14:56] next to us may not even recognize we're
[14:58] fighting at the time but more
[14:59] importantly we we also don't know
[15:02] the the voice that you are speaking in
[15:04] each and every one of our ears Lord and
[15:06] I'm just believing that you will come
[15:08] and you will speak directly to our ears
[15:10] this morning that that everything that
[15:11] we are up against every every battle
[15:13] that we're up against Lord Jesus you can
[15:15] make a way right through it and
[15:17] sometimes you will wipe it completely
[15:18] out and we're so grateful for that and
[15:20] other times you'll you'll make a way
[15:22] right through the middle of the test and
[15:23] trial that that you will be right there
[15:25] with us and just when we think that
[15:27] you're not there you're the one carrying
[15:28] us through and Lord Jesus I just ask
[15:30] that you will come and speak
[15:31] encouragement to our lives this morning
[15:33] you will speak healings but more
[15:35] importantly you will you will speak
[15:37] salvation into our lives that that those
[15:39] who are who are needing a touch from you
[15:41] those who are needing salvation and a
[15:43] saving grace that you will come and
[15:45] speak to their heart that that they will
[15:46] recognize that that they are needing a
[15:49] stronger pull from you they are needing
[15:51] a stronger walk with you and Lord Jesus
[15:53] we know when we come into your presence
[15:55] there is not a stagnant walk we will
[15:57] either leave walking closer to you or
[15:59] walking away from you Lord and I just
[16:01] believe that every every single person

[39:09] so I'm ready brother Ron
[39:12] and we turned and we walked toward the
[39:14] sunlight
[39:17] that girl sang this morning
[39:21] and I thought my heart was going to
[39:23] explode
[39:25] as she was singing with Andrew just a
[39:28] few moments ago could we just give the
[39:30] Lord a great big hand
[39:38] foreign
[39:47] thank you thank you what a powerful
[39:50] service already amen amen God bless you
[39:55] and uh
[39:59] if you will turn with me to Luke chapter
[40:00] 9 and verse 62 and then we'll go to Mark
[40:04] chapter 10 and verse 17.
[40:13] foreign
[40:23] I love that song Mercy said no
[40:27] if Satan would have been given the
[40:28] opportunity he would have just he would
[40:30] destroy you in a moment
[40:32] in an absolute moment he would destroy
[40:35] you Luke chapter 9 and verse 62.
[40:39] and Jesus said unto him
[40:43] no man
[40:45] have him put his hand to the plow
[40:48] and looking back
[40:50] is fit
[40:52] for the kingdom of God
[40:55] Mark chapter 10 and verse 17.
[41:02] and when he was gone forth into the way
[41:04] there came one running and kneeled to
[41:07] him and asked him good master
[41:12] what shall I do
[41:14] that I might inherit eternal life he
[41:17] went to the right source
[41:20] and Jesus said unto him why callest thou
[41:24] me good
[41:25] for there is none good but one
[41:29] and that is God
[41:32] thou knowest the Commandments
[41:35] do not commit adultery do not kill
[41:38] do not steal
[41:40] do not bear false witness defraud not
[41:44] honor thy father and mother
[41:47] and he answered and said unto him master
[41:50] all of these things have I observed from
[41:53] my youth
[41:54] and then Jesus beholding him loved him
[41:59] quite a statement isn't it
[42:01] and said unto him one thing thou likest
[42:04] go thy way and sell whatsoever thou Hast
[42:09] and give to the poor and thou shall have
[42:13] treasure in heaven
[42:15] and come and take up the cross and
[42:18] follow me
[42:20] and he was sad at that saying
[42:23] and went away grieved
[42:26] for he had great possessions
[42:30] and Jesus looked round about and saith
[42:32] unto his disciples
[42:34] how hardly
[42:37] shall they that have riches
[42:41] enter
[42:42] into the kingdom
[42:44] of God you may be seated this morning
[42:55] it didn't have to be that way
[43:01] I got this sermon about two and a half
[43:04] years ago
[43:08] I was standing outside a here
[43:12] conducting a funeral on the porch
[43:17] it was for a girl that had grew up on
[43:20] this property
[43:22] she was the granddaughter of one that
[43:25] that actually lived where you lived
[43:27] brother Roy and sister Darlene
[43:30] I actually stood here on this stage and
[43:33] married her to her young husband
[43:36] before a service
[43:38] they came in their wedding gown and
[43:41] and several girls and guys were there
[43:44] with them and we had a we had before
[43:46] about an hour before this service we had
[43:48] a wedding
[43:50] the next time that I would see this
[43:52] young lady
[43:53] she would
[43:54] be be gone
[43:59] and as I was there in a large group of
[44:02] bikers came
[44:03] they lined this Hillside with bikes
[44:07] quite a few people stood outside and the
[44:10] reason we had to do it outside it was
[44:11] covered and we were forbidden to to open
[44:15] the the place to do all of that not
[44:18] actually been warned by the health
[44:19] department and also by my own insurance
[44:23] company here
[44:25] and so we had it we had it outside there
[44:27] was another Minister that preached it
[44:29] with me and
[44:31] and uh from down the way and he would
[44:33] later make fun of me but
[44:35] I had to do what I had to do
[44:39] and I stood there and and God just spoke
[44:41] to my heart as I was sitting in a chair
[44:45] and he said it didn't have to be this
[44:47] way
[44:50] it didn't have to be this way here she
[44:52] lived on the property as a little girl
[44:54] growing up growing up in this church
[44:58] actually toward the end of her teenage
[45:00] year she only became periodically
[45:02] because her family only came became
[45:05] periodically and
[45:07] and
[45:08] so
[45:10] she wound up a horrible death
[45:13] just in the last couple of weeks
[45:17] uh three different friends have passed
[45:20] because of Fentanyl
[45:23] you know drugs is a is a powerful
[45:25] addiction
[45:28] but there's a demon that gets into
[45:30] people that wanted a little stronger and
[45:32] a little stronger you see sin has no
[45:35] satisfaction to it
[45:37] and it will take you way further than
[45:40] you ever thought you'd go and
[45:42] young girl 22 years old passes away a
[45:46] couple of weeks ago and a young man that
[45:48] we know passed away
[45:50] another young man brother Jason had
[45:52] brought
[45:54] brother Jason Smith had brought here
[45:57] and he was tattooed up painted painted a
[45:59] lot
[46:00] and it was a surprise to even brother
[46:02] Jason that
[46:04] it seemed like he could get his footing
[46:06] but all of a sudden and then one day
[46:09] fentanyl no doubt grabbed his life
[46:14] if the devil could he would he would
[46:16] destroy us all
[46:19] sometimes I I picked up a statement I
[46:23] want to share this with you this morning
[46:26] sometimes in our own in our own ways
[46:30] we look at things and we look at
[46:32] different difficulties and we have much
[46:34] of a blame game
[46:37] but this Saiyan says weak people get
[46:39] revenge
[46:42] strong people forgive
[46:46] intelligent people ignore
[46:52] I'd like to just share this with you too
[46:55] many people
[46:56] die before they ever really live
[47:02] I'd like to speak to you this morning as
[47:04] we would go
[47:06] sometimes we blame
[47:08] we blame others
[47:10] we blame officials we blame the
[47:13] president
[47:14] we blame the pastor we blame the school
[47:17] teachers
[47:19] School teachers for example they they go
[47:22] to school and they spend years trying to
[47:24] prepare themselves to be able to
[47:26] adequately teach and bring out potential
[47:30] in individuals lives to make them better
[47:35] but many times people set through 12 15
[47:37] years of schooling
[47:41] and only and only just allow it to go
[47:44] through and don't really get it the
[47:46] light don't come on
[47:48] others begin to Excel and pass and but
[47:52] let me just say you must you must work
[47:56] you must work you must you must put
[47:59] yourself forward because there's
[48:01] potential in every person
[48:05] there's potential whether you're a a
[48:07] poor person or a very rich person
[48:10] there's extreme potential in every
[48:12] individual
[48:14] and listen God don't send nobody to hell
[48:19] God doesn't send nobody to hell your
[48:23] choices
[48:26] oh my brother Ron if only if only if
[48:30] only
[48:31] sometimes we live a life of regrets
[48:34] it's kind of like eating donuts and then
[48:36] regretting that you ate them
[48:41] there's always been a saying that the
[48:43] grass is always greener on the other
[48:45] side
[48:47] before long people begin to explore
[48:50] Satan's got every bait that he can throw
[48:53] at you
[48:54] and let me just say remind you Satan is
[48:58] nobody that you want to negotiate with
[49:02] we're going through this life and we're
[49:04] only going to go through it for just a
[49:06] short time even if you live a hundred
[49:08] years
[49:09] but at the end of it what do you have
[49:16] let me just say sin has no satisfaction
[49:23] there's no bottom to the fall of sin
[49:27] you'll just continue to fall if you'll
[49:29] remember brother Branham when in the
[49:31] souls now in prison and he gives us both
[49:34] sides of Heaven and Hell
[49:36] and when he experienced hell he said it
[49:40] was like falling for an eternity and
[49:42] there was nobody to catch him and he
[49:45] said I screamed for my mother and I
[49:48] screamed for my father
[49:50] and there was nobody there
[49:53] all right
[49:54] he began to tell us that he he said I've
[49:57] never sinned I've never committed
[49:59] adultery I've never done none of those
[50:01] things
[50:03] God will allow him to go through this
[50:05] experience to where that he could help
[50:08] the worst sinner that there would be
[50:11] he would allow him to go through the
[50:14] experience of Heaven to share with us
[50:16] that what life is after here
[50:19] I choose heaven
[50:24] but when we begin to think of these
[50:27] things
[50:28] I quoted this just a few weeks ago I've
[50:32] given God a million reasons
[50:35] not to love me
[50:38] and none of them
[50:40] changed his mind
[50:46] aren't you grateful for that
[50:48] aren't you absolutely grateful for that
[50:54] brother random says he says a lady was
[50:57] driving along with her father
[51:00] and They Came Upon a storm and the young
[51:02] lady asked her father what should I do
[51:04] he said keep driving
[51:06] cars begin to pull over to the side the
[51:09] storm was getting worse what should I do
[51:12] the young lady asked keep driving
[51:15] her father replied
[51:18] and on up the up on a few feet she
[51:20] noticed that 18 wheelers were also
[51:23] pulled over and she told her dad I must
[51:26] pull over I can barely see ahead it is
[51:29] terrible and everyone is pulling over
[51:30] and her father told her don't give up
[51:34] just keep driving
[51:36] now the storm was terrible but she never
[51:39] stopped driving
[51:41] and soon she could see a just a little
[51:44] bit more clearly after a couple of Miles
[51:47] She again was now on dry ground
[51:51] and the sun came out and her father said
[51:54] now you can pull over
[51:59] and get out and she said but why now
[52:02] he said when you get back look at all of
[52:05] the people that gave up
[52:08] and are still in the storm but because
[52:12] you never gave up your storm is over now
[52:18] he said this is a testimony for anyone
[52:21] who is going to go through some hard
[52:22] times just because everyone else even
[52:26] the strongest gives up you don't have to
[52:29] if you keep going soon your storm will
[52:33] be over and the sun will shine on your
[52:37] face
[52:41] let me just ask you the question can our
[52:44] God be trusted
[52:46] remember he is the one that is faithful
[52:50] and he will provide for his promises
[52:53] God's promises are irrevocable
[52:57] because of who God is
[52:59] he is unchanging he sees the end from
[53:02] the beginning he never caught has never
[53:05] been caught off guard or or even
[53:08] unexpected moments
[53:10] he makes no mid-course Corrections
[53:17] he is not victimized by moods
[53:21] hello amen
[53:23] or weather
[53:25] he never changes or casts a shifting
[53:27] shadow
[53:29] our God is faithful
[53:31] God can be trusted to keep his promise
[53:36] he is strong
[53:38] he does not compromise
[53:42] he does not over promise
[53:45] he does not under deliver
[53:48] God is able to Purdue whatever he
[53:52] promises that he can do
[53:55] he cannot lie
[53:57] it is impossible for God to God
[54:01] a rock cannot swim
[54:03] a hippo cannot fly
[54:06] a butterfly
[54:08] cannot eat a bowl of spaghetti
[54:11] you cannot sleep on a cloud and God
[54:14] cannot lie
[54:16] [Applause]
[54:25] he never exaggerates
[54:27] manipulates
[54:29] fibs flatters
[54:33] it is impossible for him to lie
[54:38] the seed is simply
[54:41] but it's not an option
[54:44] God will keep his promises to you
[54:49] I want to say this to you
[54:51] failure for us is not an option
[54:55] I refuse to turn back and go back
[55:00] hmm
[55:02] we all understand that the lack of
[55:04] preparation for storms
[55:07] it's 100 percent the way for you to fail
[55:14] now you say well brother Ron but I I get
[55:16] exhausted
[55:17] whatever the reason
[55:19] too much pressure
[55:21] exhaustion frustration lack of
[55:25] commitment
[55:26] the field to flee and run away to the
[55:29] mountains
[55:30] run from our responsibility
[55:33] refuse to train for the bout
[55:36] pressures all around us whether they be
[55:39] peer pressure or anxiety Within
[55:42] the feeling to escape it all
[55:46] just simply being fatigued and wore out
[55:49] wiped out the things that you've been
[55:52] through
[55:53] agonizing over yesterday
[55:56] it's kind of like just almost having a
[56:00] wreck
[56:02] and then you can if you don't straighten
[56:05] yourself up from that wreck you can't
[56:06] drive another mile
[56:09] but you got to come to yourself
[56:12] we must move forward
[56:15] why brother Ron nobody cares nobody
[56:18] cares for us let me just say this to you
[56:21] in that feeling God always cares
[56:28] God always cares I want you to just
[56:31] drive this down say it with me my God
[56:34] always cares
[56:36] when your phone can't reach nobody where
[56:39] nobody has said anything to you over the
[56:42] last couple of weeks and it seems like
[56:44] that they've avoided you that's just the
[56:46] devil telling you that
[56:50] that's just the devil telling you that
[56:52] but my God is always with you
[56:55] he said I'll never leave you I'll never
[56:57] forsake you I will be with you whether
[57:01] you can see him or whether you can feel
[57:03] him he is in control of your situation
[57:08] [Applause]
[57:13] never give up
[57:16] say it with me never give up
[57:24] the scripture says that I can do all
[57:26] things through Christ that strengthens
[57:27] me
[57:36] as long as you were a spectator
[57:43] and not a real part of serving God
[57:46] the devil was all right with that
[57:52] I want to drive some points
[57:54] as long as you were a spectator
[57:58] [Music]
[58:01] people can go to a ball game
[58:03] they can cheer
[58:05] but they've never lifted a weight
[58:08] they've never run a mile
[58:10] they've never been hit like a car
[58:13] hitting them
[58:14] men in their greatest conditions
[58:18] struggling over a ball
[58:22] LEDs are destroyed concussions happen
[58:26] people can sit in the stand and make fun
[58:30] they can Monday Morning Quarterback all
[58:32] but they didn't put nothing in
[58:35] a lot of people can Google and say all
[58:38] different kind of things but they
[58:40] haven't said in these seats
[58:42] [Applause]
[58:47] foreign
[58:57] even sitting in these seats if you don't
[58:59] come to worship if you don't come to
[59:02] pull on the word of God you're not going
[59:04] to get anything out
[59:17] the very moment that you start serving
[59:19] God
[59:24] and Raven in your head and worshiping
[59:27] the Lord all hell
[59:31] will break loose
[59:35] as long as you set like a mouse in the
[59:38] church
[59:40] and there's no movement from you
[59:42] whatsoever the devil's not going to
[59:45] bother you too much
[59:47] but the moment that you have a
[59:49] breakthrough
[59:51] how about help me preach the moment that
[59:54] you have a breakthrough
[59:56] where you break through in prayer will
[59:59] you break through in worship where you
[1:00:01] break through and get something from the
[1:00:03] word then the devil is going to do his
[1:00:06] best
[1:00:07] [Applause]
[1:00:22] sometime a gold there was brother Brian
[1:00:25] was sharing this story and it's long but
[1:00:27] I want to I gotta it's got a point to it
[1:00:29] some time ago there was up here in
[1:00:32] Indiana there was two boys
[1:00:35] that was raised on a farm
[1:00:45] they were just as poor as they could be
[1:00:47] Farmer Boys
[1:00:49] they grew up together and one day one of
[1:00:51] them got married
[1:00:53] a few days afterward the other one got
[1:00:55] married
[1:00:57] the one went to the city to live and
[1:01:00] he had begun to play the stock markets
[1:01:03] and got away from his childhood teaching
[1:01:06] went into wrong things
[1:01:09] he played them and he got richer and
[1:01:11] richer and so they finally become a
[1:01:14] millionaire
[1:01:16] he had moved up to Chicago and
[1:01:19] got one of those great one of those
[1:01:21] great streets and built himself a palace
[1:01:24] him and his wife running to the
[1:01:26] nightclubs and they drank cocktails and
[1:01:29] they laid out all night long they had
[1:01:32] butlers
[1:01:33] everything to furnish them anything they
[1:01:36] wanted
[1:01:38] they thought they were really living
[1:01:42] but a man that lives like that has no
[1:01:45] peace
[1:01:46] there is no peace in a troubled heart
[1:01:50] to a sinful heart there could not be
[1:01:52] peace from man longs to drink and he
[1:01:55] calls that life he thinks that he's
[1:01:57] having a big time and he shows his
[1:01:59] emptiness
[1:02:01] you take a man that make a million
[1:02:03] dollars he wants to
[1:02:05] you take a man that goes to a party and
[1:02:07] drinks one drink tonight he'll want to
[1:02:10] go to another you take a man that lives
[1:02:12] untrue to his wife once he'll live it
[1:02:15] again
[1:02:16] he said it's something that he's never
[1:02:19] satisfied
[1:02:21] might have a million dollars in his hand
[1:02:23] and 10 million in his hand and he lays
[1:02:26] down at night with a drunken stew on him
[1:02:28] and he wakes up the next morning haunted
[1:02:31] nightmares troubled Minds him
[1:02:34] you call that peace that's not peace
[1:02:38] but a man might not even have a pillar
[1:02:42] to press his head to he might not even
[1:02:45] on a p a decent pair of shoes or be able
[1:02:49] to have a decent meal in his house but
[1:02:52] if God Reigns in his heart
[1:02:55] he goes to bed happy and he wakes up
[1:02:59] happy
[1:03:00] it's lasting peace it's something that
[1:03:03] God does
[1:03:05] this fella forgot about that teaching he
[1:03:07] went to gambling and when Christmas time
[1:03:10] come he he thought of his buddy he wrote
[1:03:12] he wrote him a letter and one of his
[1:03:15] names was Jim Rich Man and John a poor
[1:03:18] man
[1:03:19] and wrote him a letter John I wish you'd
[1:03:21] come and see me
[1:03:23] through the holidays I I'd like to meet
[1:03:26] you and talk to you again I haven't seen
[1:03:28] you for many years
[1:03:30] he wrote him back and he said I'd like
[1:03:32] to come Jim but I can't come
[1:03:35] I haven't got any money to come
[1:03:39] a check came in the mail a few days
[1:03:41] later come on I want you to come
[1:03:45] so John got ready country boy put on a
[1:03:48] clean pair of overhauls
[1:03:52] his hat
[1:03:53] little coat different color
[1:03:56] boarded the train and when he got there
[1:03:58] there was a chauffeur sitting there to
[1:04:01] meet him and with a big limousine
[1:04:04] I didn't even know exactly how to act
[1:04:06] he got in his limousine holding his hat
[1:04:09] in his hand and looking around
[1:04:11] drove up to a great place in Palace in
[1:04:13] Chicago
[1:04:15] he got out and he went to the door and
[1:04:17] rung the bell and out came the butler
[1:04:20] and he said your card please
[1:04:24] he didn't know what he was talking about
[1:04:27] he handed him his hat
[1:04:30] he didn't know nothing about no
[1:04:31] reception card
[1:04:34] he didn't have much of the world's good
[1:04:36] and he said
[1:04:37] I I want your card
[1:04:40] he said I don't know what you're talking
[1:04:42] about and Jim Jim sent me a letter to
[1:04:44] for me to come that's all I know he went

[1:04:56] door he's dressed I've never seen him a
[1:04:58] man dressed like that
[1:05:00] and he said Jim sent him
[1:05:02] he said tell him to come on in

[1:05:07] down the hall and he met his old country
[1:05:08] friend and
[1:05:10] of his and shook his hand and said John

[1:05:18] around in the room said
[1:05:20] Jim you sure got a plenty now
[1:05:23] he said I want to show you around and he
[1:05:25] took him upstairs and they went out on
[1:05:28] the sun porch and opened up the window
[1:05:30] he said where's Martha
[1:05:33] oh she hasn't come in now she was out

[1:05:53] you've got any children no Martha
[1:05:56] wouldn't have any of those children
[1:05:58] she thought we'd be better not having
[1:06:00] any children interferes with our social
[1:06:02] life
[1:06:05] raise back the curtains and said look to

[1:06:18] stock
[1:06:19] shares in that

[1:06:23] Gardens and everything and how beautiful
[1:06:24] it looked and oh John stood there with
[1:06:27] his straw hat in his hand and looked
[1:06:29] around said that's fine Jim
[1:06:31] I'm sure thankful that you've got it but
[1:06:33] me and Katie we ain't got much
[1:06:35] but we still live in that old split
[1:06:37] Shingle House down there we don't have
[1:06:39] very much but we're awful happy
[1:06:46] just then a bunch of Carol Singers
[1:06:48] lifted their voices and began to sing
[1:06:50] silent night holy night all is calm and
[1:06:53] all is bright
[1:06:55] round young virgin mother and child holy
[1:06:58] infant so tender and mild
[1:07:00] Jim turned and looked at John John
[1:07:03] looked up at Jim and said John I want to
[1:07:05] ask you something you remember when we
[1:07:08] were boys we used to go with that little
[1:07:10] little red Church down there on the side
[1:07:12] of the road and we'd hear a Old Country
[1:07:15] choir sing those songs yes
[1:07:19] you still go down there
[1:07:21] yeah
[1:07:22] I still belong there I'm a deacon down
[1:07:25] there now
[1:07:26] what about you Jim
[1:07:29] you was talking about how much that you
[1:07:31] owned down here
[1:07:34] but how much do you own up there
[1:07:41] John I'm sorry I I don't own nothing
[1:07:43] that way
[1:07:45] remember just before Christmas one year
[1:07:49] we didn't have any shoes and we were
[1:07:51] more interested in getting some of some
[1:07:53] firecrackers for Christmas
[1:07:55] and we went out and set some box traps
[1:07:58] and
[1:07:59] caught some rabbits and we got some
[1:08:01] firecrackers for Christmas
[1:08:03] you remember that morning those big old
[1:08:05] wood rabbit was in the box trap of ours
[1:08:09] yeah I remember
[1:08:11] you were you would you would get some
[1:08:13] firecrackers and we went and got some
[1:08:15] and divided it with me yes
[1:08:17] John I'll divide anything that I got
[1:08:20] with you
[1:08:22] but one thing that I wish that I could
[1:08:24] divide
[1:08:26] to me
[1:08:27] I give everything to own
[1:08:30] I'd give everything I own
[1:08:33] if I could walk that little Dusty Road
[1:08:38] barefooted up to that little old church
[1:08:40] and feel the presence of the Living God
[1:08:44] when the choir was singing an old
[1:08:46] country preacher was preaching I didn't
[1:08:49] give anything I'd give all that I own
[1:08:51] everything to every share in that
[1:08:53] Railroad
[1:08:55] all my part in the bank even this home
[1:08:58] at all if I could turn again and have
[1:09:02] that blessed peace that I had when I was
[1:09:05] up that old road
[1:09:08] oh John took him by his arms around and
[1:09:10] said
[1:09:12] there was three wise men
[1:09:14] Rich that came and laid all at the feet
[1:09:18] of Jesus one time as a baby
[1:09:21] and they received pardoning for their
[1:09:23] sins
[1:09:25] I'd although I'd I'd think that you're
[1:09:28] wonderful Jim and in all that you have
[1:09:31] been blessed to do and all these things
[1:09:32] but I'd rather have a wife and seven
[1:09:34] children living down there in straw tips
[1:09:38] to sleep on then then have and have
[1:09:42] peace that's in my heart than to have
[1:09:44] all of your riches
[1:09:52] and that's right friends
[1:09:55] riches is not measured out by dollars
[1:09:59] riches is not measured out by big names
[1:10:01] and popularity
[1:10:03] riches is when the kingdom of God has
[1:10:06] come into your heart and change this
[1:10:09] emotion and made him a new creature in
[1:10:13] Christ Jesus and give him eternal life
[1:10:17] that's the richest thing that's on Earth
[1:10:23] brother Branham told this story and no
[1:10:25] doubt took him some time to tell it and
[1:10:27] it took me some time to read it to you
[1:10:31] but I have a reason to do it if you gain
[1:10:33] this whole world
[1:10:35] [Applause]
[1:10:37] if you gain this whole world
[1:10:44] and lose it all
[1:10:46] what profits you
[1:10:50] you're gonna have millions of dollars in
[1:10:52] the stock market and let it fall and all
[1:10:54] of a sudden your half is rich
[1:10:58] you can't control the stock market you
[1:11:01] can't control nature you can't control
[1:11:03] governments you can think that you own
[1:11:06] it all and in a day or two it all be
[1:11:08] gone
[1:11:10] the depression proved that many people
[1:11:12] that were Rich became pulpers and only
[1:11:15] to commit suicide because they didn't
[1:11:17] have it anymore but how many of our
[1:11:20] families
[1:11:21] live through the depression
[1:11:24] no stocks in the market no great riches
[1:11:27] in the bank but because they had Jesus
[1:11:33] my daddy said I thought everybody else
[1:11:36] lived like I did didn't know a
[1:11:38] depression was going on we just knew we
[1:11:41] was poor
[1:11:44] I'd rather have Jesus than anything
[1:11:48] brother Branham said at many a table
[1:11:50] that was of wealthy people
[1:11:52] there was he was entertained by a lot of
[1:11:55] people that was had great wealth
[1:11:58] but let me just say
[1:11:59] he would rather have an atmosphere to
[1:12:02] where the angel would come
[1:12:04] have a suit that would have a hole in it
[1:12:08] drive an old car and sleep up under that
[1:12:11] car at Mishawaka get some stale biscuits
[1:12:15] he would rather be with Jesus
[1:12:18] and where Jesus is than to own it all
[1:12:22] let me just say this heavens and earth
[1:12:24] is going to pass away
[1:12:28] all right
[1:12:37] this story
[1:12:39] it didn't have to be that way
[1:12:45] Adam hiding in the garden
[1:12:50] Demas forsaking Paul
[1:12:53] for popularity and riches it didn't have
[1:12:56] to be that way
[1:12:57] the Rich Young Lula
[1:13:00] it didn't have to be that way God
[1:13:03] provided a way even God provided a way
[1:13:06] for Cain
[1:13:08] if you'll do like your brother
[1:13:16] it didn't have to be that way
[1:13:19] for the young girl on the porch
[1:13:22] it didn't have to be that way
[1:13:27] how many peoples have had friends that
[1:13:29] walked into churches like ours
[1:13:34] and one received Christ and another make
[1:13:37] fun
[1:13:41] it didn't have to be that way
[1:13:43] maybe you'll have to walk away from many
[1:13:45] friends in your life but if your friends
[1:13:48] are drawing you to the darker Realm
[1:13:50] they're not your friends
[1:13:53] this may be an ugly thing to say but
[1:13:55] they're not your friends
[1:13:58] a man that will pull a beer to your your
[1:14:00] mouth it's not your friend a friend
[1:14:03] that'll give you
[1:14:05] drugs and alcohol they're not your
[1:14:08] friends
[1:14:11] here we go
[1:14:16] they're not your friend it may feel good
[1:14:19] for the moment but they're not your
[1:14:20] friend they won't be there when sirosis
[1:14:23] of the liver is set in they will be
[1:14:26] there when your brain cells are gone and
[1:14:27] you don't know your own name
[1:14:34] people are scared to death to go to the
[1:14:35] doctor they're scared enough to get a
[1:14:37] shot but they'll take drugs
[1:14:41] from God only knows where they came from
[1:14:44] mixed up in some lab somewhere or
[1:14:46] another just to get an artificial High
[1:14:52] they're not your friends
[1:14:56] are somebody that will stick closer to
[1:14:58] their brother friends or somebody that
[1:15:01] will forgive you and overlook your
[1:15:02] mistakes that will be there at the end
[1:15:05] to help you get up that's your friends
[1:15:20] good morning
[1:15:22] Noah like the people of today
[1:15:26] they realize the world's coming to an
[1:15:28] end
[1:15:31] I'm not telling you no secret
[1:15:34] whether you've heard a message of
[1:15:35] brother branham's or not
[1:15:38] this world's coming to an end
[1:15:40] you can put your head in the sand and
[1:15:42] ignore all the signs and quit watching
[1:15:44] CNN or Fox News or whatever your
[1:15:47] favorite channel is you can cut all of
[1:15:49] that off it's coming to an end
[1:15:51] governments are so corrupt there's no
[1:15:54] great men among them anymore there's no
[1:15:56] Abraham Lincoln or No George Washington
[1:15:58] to raise back up
[1:16:00] they're searching the country for
[1:16:02] somebody to step up and give us the
[1:16:05] answer there's no answer Jesus
[1:16:09] [Applause]
[1:16:13] a place where he has prepared for you
[1:16:16] will walk on Gates of streets of gold
[1:16:19] and Gates of peril
[1:16:24] that's a king that's the politics I want
[1:16:27] to be a part of
[1:16:31] brother bam says Oh What a Sad thing
[1:16:33] it's going to be for the Lost
[1:16:37] that after they have sealed their Doom
[1:16:40] after they've heard their last sermon
[1:16:45] and to be
[1:16:46] in a devil's hell
[1:16:49] lost
[1:16:51] no chance to repent at all
[1:16:55] now notice his statement to remember the
[1:16:59] opportunities that they turned down
[1:17:04] you say unto me preacher is there
[1:17:07] Remembrance in hell
[1:17:09] yes Jesus said there was
[1:17:11] and he said the rich man lifted up his
[1:17:13] eyes in hell
[1:17:16] and saw Abraham and Lazarus in his bosom
[1:17:18] and he said remember in your lifetime
[1:17:24] there is a remembrance
[1:17:27] in hell
[1:17:30] oh
[1:17:32] how the Lost
[1:17:34] what an awful thing that that would be
[1:17:36] to know that the great meetings that you
[1:17:38] set in
[1:17:40] and heard Mighty sermons of anointed
[1:17:42] preachers of God
[1:17:44] and not only that to but to see anointed
[1:17:47] signs and wonders that God had performed
[1:17:50] among the people and then to remember
[1:17:53] all of these warnings
[1:17:58] now be lost
[1:18:00] it would haunt them forever
[1:18:05] it didn't have to be that way
[1:18:12] a young girl
[1:18:15] was a
[1:18:17] was an actress
[1:18:20] she was an actress in Hollywood and she
[1:18:22] was making her way up
[1:18:24] played in a movie with Elvis Presley
[1:18:27] one of the leading ladies
[1:18:31] and when those directors and those men
[1:18:35] wanted her to pay the price behind the
[1:18:38] scene
[1:18:39] she went back home to her Godly mother
[1:18:44] and said I don't need that
[1:18:47] and she wound up in brother John
[1:18:49] Steven's church and brother Danny
[1:18:51] Stevens and I was able to sit with her
[1:18:53] many times at tables and we would talk
[1:18:58] what a reward
[1:19:00] [Applause]
[1:19:02] you know when you come down to die 93
[1:19:05] years old and being the most sexy woman
[1:19:07] in the world there's a price for that
[1:19:12] there's a price for that but it didn't
[1:19:14] have to be that way
[1:19:19] Marilyn Monroe whom brother Brandon
[1:19:22] would see dying
[1:19:24] he would detail how she died
[1:19:27] science didn't say that
[1:19:29] but he would tell how she died
[1:19:31] all the men celebrities presidents
[1:19:35] that didn't satisfy the sinful heart
[1:19:38] but he said if I could have only got to
[1:19:40] her and introduced her to Jesus
[1:19:44] [Applause]
[1:19:46] it didn't have to be that way
[1:19:49] I stood at the place in West Virginia
[1:19:51] where Elvis Presley stood and led
[1:19:54] singing
[1:19:55] and his Granddaddy's tent meeting
[1:19:59] but when it came it's time to die he
[1:20:02] actually had three different preachers
[1:20:03] come to him and told all three the same
[1:20:06] story I have sold my soul
[1:20:14] it didn't have to be that way
[1:20:21] brother brother Aaron Oglesby that will
[1:20:24] be with us a couple of times this year
[1:20:27] his father and mother separated decades
[1:20:30] ago they couldn't get along
[1:20:32] there's sometimes people
[1:20:33] or sometimes people can't get along with
[1:20:36] Jesus
[1:20:39] they had children three children two
[1:20:40] boys and a girl
[1:20:42] one was poisoned in this way and
[1:20:44] poisoned in that way
[1:20:47] brother Aaron was a very stable young
[1:20:49] man he didn't take sides
[1:20:52] he grew up in that atmosphere of a
[1:20:54] broken home
[1:20:55] horrible words no doubt backwards and
[1:20:58] forwards there's you know there's always
[1:20:59] three sides to every story
[1:21:03] his side her side to right side
[1:21:06] [Music]
[1:21:08] most the time it's selfishness it's just
[1:21:11] plain selfishness if you listen this is
[1:21:14] how marriage really works
[1:21:16] if you can lay your pride down
[1:21:19] and become humble and serve one and I'm
[1:21:22] not talking about 90 10.
[1:21:26] I'm not even trying to get you to be 50
[1:21:28] 50. but make Jesus the center of your
[1:21:31] home
[1:21:31] [Applause]
[1:21:33] and he's the king he's the Lord he's the
[1:21:36] Unseen guest at every table
[1:21:40] talk to him when you get up talk to him
[1:21:42] when you go to bed have a place that you
[1:21:45] pray
[1:21:50] Aaron's father
[1:21:53] is dying of a horrible
[1:21:55] stage four cancer
[1:21:58] he's been in church for about the last
[1:22:00] 20 years
[1:22:01] he sets in one place his wife sits in
[1:22:04] another
[1:22:06] he sets a very quiet man
[1:22:10] I'm sharing this story I didn't call to
[1:22:13] get permission but
[1:22:16] it's okay
[1:22:19] it goes with this
[1:22:24] brother Aaron prayed the other day he
[1:22:25] said
[1:22:27] my daddy's
[1:22:28] in the facility
[1:22:31] he's dying
[1:22:34] brother Tim's going to see it
[1:22:37] and he said God
[1:22:39] let my mama
[1:22:41] show up at the same time
[1:22:47] what do you know
[1:22:49] prayers come true
[1:22:52] and brother Tim being a preacher
[1:22:55] I'll be an anointed man of God
[1:22:58] one of my favorite preachers on Earth
[1:23:00] and I you know brother Ron you're
[1:23:02] supposed to have favorites you're a liar
[1:23:10] and he shows up and something
[1:23:12] Supernatural happens
[1:23:16] he marries this couple
[1:23:22] that has thought all these years
[1:23:25] and lived apart all these years
[1:23:28] and caused all kind of toxins and
[1:23:30] poisons
[1:23:31] and on his death bed
[1:23:36] he marries his wife
[1:23:43] what good is that going to do it'll do a
[1:23:45] lot of good
[1:23:48] when they Step Beyond the curtain of
[1:23:50] time
[1:23:52] and they stand and eternity together
[1:23:56] what God has put together let no man put
[1:23:58] asunder
[1:24:00] and they step back into eternity
[1:24:01] together
[1:24:03] it has caused a healing
[1:24:05] it has caused a restoration to that
[1:24:08] entire family all the words are now laid
[1:24:12] aside all the herd is now laid aside
[1:24:16] and now God has brought a healing
[1:24:19] I pray God raises the man up takes the
[1:24:23] cancer out of his life and they live
[1:24:25] another 10 years to the Rapture together
[1:24:28] my God can do anything
[1:24:30] [Applause]
[1:24:45] I want to say something to punctuate
[1:24:48] that
[1:24:50] it didn't have to be that way
[1:24:57] I have a friend
[1:24:59] came with me to church
[1:25:02] there's an artist
[1:25:07] he's now
[1:25:09] he's now over top the ominous magazine
[1:25:12] in New York
[1:25:14] he married the owner's doctor daughter
[1:25:18] and I read that story for a reason
[1:25:21] I don't know how many millions of
[1:25:24] dollars
[1:25:25] that my friend now makes
[1:25:28] but I wouldn't change
[1:25:32] I wouldn't change what God's done for me
[1:25:35] in my life
[1:25:37] standing here with the cancer that's
[1:25:39] really my body and the headache that's
[1:25:41] taking place in my my my head right now
[1:25:44] wiping with a wet rag to get through
[1:25:47] this God spoke to me to preach and I'm
[1:25:49] going to preach it
[1:25:52] trade my life for all the things of this
[1:25:56] world
[1:26:13] brother Graham said the choices that you
[1:26:15] make
[1:26:16] here today
[1:26:19] if you want to be a real Christian five
[1:26:21] years from now you can be a real
[1:26:22] Christian
[1:26:24] or you can choose difference
[1:26:27] and five years from now being hell
[1:26:30] okay
[1:26:31] I've said it before I say it again take
[1:26:33] a picture of your life

[1:26:37] in this service
[1:26:39] not only is God here but the devil's
[1:26:41] here

[1:26:45] get you distracted on what you're going
[1:26:46] to eat after a while or or whatever

[1:26:50] or the friends that you're missing right

[1:26:56] and maybe cause you because of Pride to
[1:27:01] keep you from walking to the altar I've
[1:27:03] said this many times the greatest steps
[1:27:06] you'll ever make
[1:27:08] oh
[1:27:09] it's the first couple that will get you
[1:27:11] out of your Pew and walk you to an altar
[1:27:14] and tell the devil you're no longer the
[1:27:16] king of my heart I'm no longer a slave
[1:27:19] to you
[1:27:28] in a moment your life can change and the
[1:27:31] old King dies and a new king takes over
[1:27:35] old habits are gone the new creature
[1:27:38] takes over in your life
[1:27:41] Hallelujah
[1:27:42] aren't in the opposite of that you can
[1:27:44] receive a spirit
[1:27:46] whether it's a critical spirit a lustful
[1:27:49] spirit
[1:27:51] the devil will only talk you into
[1:27:53] smoking a cigarette one time
[1:27:58] he'll only talk you in
[1:28:00] to looking at porn one time and then
[1:28:02] your flesh will take you back there over
[1:28:06] and over again
[1:28:08] but you say brother Ron and I know I'm
[1:28:10] only talking to maybe one or two here
[1:28:11] today but I'm probably talking to a lot
[1:28:13] on the internet
[1:28:16] virgin brother
[1:28:18] come on
[1:28:21] what would you trade for eternal life
[1:28:27] Which side will you choose
[1:28:31] a job that pays you two hundred dollars
[1:28:33] an hour
[1:28:34] that takes you away from church takes
[1:28:36] you away from God
[1:28:39] takes you away from your family
[1:28:41] takes you away from your children I want
[1:28:43] to say this to you
[1:28:45] now as I set where I'm sitting I love to
[1:28:48] hear my little grandchildren all the
[1:28:51] noise that they make
[1:28:54] I love to hear them make their noise
[1:28:57] I love to hear them play
[1:29:06] I love to have them crawl up on my lap
[1:29:08] and tell me how much they love me
[1:29:13] there's nothing in this world I trade
[1:29:15] for that
[1:29:21] thank you brother
[1:29:27] amen
[1:29:34] Moses chose the afflictions and the
[1:29:37] disgrace
[1:29:42] that he might walk with the people of
[1:29:44] God
[1:29:46] he had a choice
[1:29:49] he could have been pharaoh
[1:29:52] sure Ramses was there
[1:29:56] but pharaoh before him
[1:29:59] chose Moses over top of Ramses
[1:30:05] lot stood with Abraham
[1:30:09] and he chose the well-watered plains of
[1:30:13] of Sodom
[1:30:16] never seeing it being destroyed
[1:30:19] never thought it would take him to be
[1:30:21] the mayor of the city
[1:30:23] he never ever thought
[1:30:26] that in a very crucial hour he would
[1:30:29] offer up his virgin daughters
[1:30:34] to this homosexual perverted crowd
[1:30:41] to save his own skin
[1:30:53] Abraham a vagabond
[1:30:56] and God's speaking to him and him
[1:30:58] telling him that I've had visitations
[1:31:02] was not enough to hold lot
[1:31:05] had aspirations of being somebody in
[1:31:08] life
[1:31:10] but look where it took him
[1:31:15] look where it took him
[1:31:18] even angels
[1:31:21] coming
[1:31:22] taking his daughters and his wife
[1:31:25] and even in their escape
[1:31:29] Miss lot
[1:31:31] turns and looks back
[1:31:38] of all of the women in the scriptures
[1:31:41] Jesus calls her
[1:31:45] remember
[1:31:46] light's wife
[1:31:49] and if you'll just think of this just
[1:31:51] for a moment
[1:31:54] he's talking about her age
[1:31:58] he's talking about this Sodom and
[1:31:59] generation that we live in
[1:32:02] if you can't see the Rapture coming
[1:32:04] you're not looking
[1:32:07] and if you can't see that just any day
[1:32:10] the Lord's going to come back
[1:32:12] you're just not looking
[1:32:16] but brother on Someday I'm listen let me
[1:32:19] just say this to you like The Sword and
[1:32:21] it's hanging over my head let me just
[1:32:23] say enjoy every day that I've got
[1:32:26] every day appreciate every day but let
[1:32:29] me just say the sword of resurrection
[1:32:32] and rapture
[1:32:35] could happen today
[1:32:46] I I someday want to preach on the Left
[1:32:49] Behind
[1:32:54] there are some instructions that people
[1:32:56] need to have
[1:33:00] it's instructions for people that
[1:33:01] couldn't get their self to church
[1:33:06] hahaha
[1:33:07] they couldn't fall in love with God
[1:33:09] enough
[1:33:12] but because they see your bodies changed
[1:33:16] it does something to them
[1:33:19] that they will walk into a tribulation
[1:33:21] period
[1:33:22] and they won't just go to church but
[1:33:24] they'll have to give their life
[1:33:27] maybe paying tithes here was too much
[1:33:30] but they're going to have to give their
[1:33:31] blood
[1:33:34] maybe maybe Los Angeles drop into the
[1:33:38] ocean was a fairy tale
[1:33:40] but after it happens I after the water
[1:33:43] is coming up on the ark everybody's a
[1:33:45] believer
[1:33:46] of the rest is dropping bombs
[1:33:49] [Applause]
[1:33:51] on our American soul
[1:33:54] you know as long as the battle is taking
[1:33:56] place in the Ukraine
[1:34:00] it doesn't affect us too much but let
[1:34:03] them drop a bomb on your house
[1:34:15] am I driving my point
[1:34:20] well brother Ron what if
[1:34:23] what is the credit to serving the lord
[1:34:25] can I have five more minutes
[1:34:30] peace
[1:34:36] a good family
[1:34:40] a wife that you can trust
[1:34:44] a husband you can trust
[1:34:48] you don't have to search his phone
[1:34:51] to see if he's doing nonsense
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:55] give me this five minutes is going to be
[1:34:57] tough but you hanging down
[1:34:59] you don't have to look at his computer
[1:35:01] and see if he's going to the wrong size
[1:35:07] you don't find the wrong pictures there
[1:35:09] you know the man that's leading you in
[1:35:11] prayer and reading scriptures let me
[1:35:14] just say you know that man lives right
[1:35:17] he talks right he walks right and the
[1:35:20] presence of God flows through your home
[1:35:26] oh come on we're here I'll take that
[1:35:30] I'll take that I'll take that
[1:35:37] young boys
[1:35:39] you're going to make choices in life
[1:35:43] that two-bit floozy will not make you a
[1:35:46] good wife
[1:35:50] I could use another word
[1:35:52] shall not make your Good Wife
[1:35:56] if she'll sleep with you before marriage
[1:35:58] you'll sleep with somebody else before
[1:36:00] marriage
[1:36:10] you're married and you're having trouble
[1:36:11] and then as Satan will send you a trap
[1:36:14] don't you think that that woman that
[1:36:15] wants to sleep with you a man she slept
[1:36:19] with a dozen mom
[1:36:26] listen marriage has some tough roads in
[1:36:29] it
[1:36:29] it's roads where you get sick
[1:36:33] and all of a sudden you're the nurse
[1:36:39] roads where you're watching your husband
[1:36:40] throw up repetitively over and over
[1:36:42] laying in the floor screaming
[1:36:47] and it was for better for worse
[1:36:53] my cousin had a baby
[1:36:56] and that baby was born perfectly
[1:36:58] but it caused her to have a stroke
[1:37:03] she was almost an envelope at the rest
[1:37:05] of her life
[1:37:07] but that man that said I do for better
[1:37:10] for worse
[1:37:12] when he saw her in a stroke condition he
[1:37:14] walked away
[1:37:17] and my uncle and Aunt took care of her
[1:37:19] until the day she went home to be with
[1:37:21] the Lord
[1:37:25] he didn't love her
[1:37:30] he didn't love her
[1:37:32] long and short he didn't love her
[1:37:36] neither does a man love a woman that he
[1:37:39] beats on
[1:37:42] or he speaks too harshly all the time
[1:37:46] listen you can't say you love your wife
[1:37:48] when you treat her bad
[1:37:51] I don't care how how difficult things
[1:37:54] get in life turn to Jesus
[1:37:56] [Music]
[1:37:57] [Applause]
[1:38:14] brother on but I hang with my buddies
[1:38:16] you know my buddies and us we got a lot
[1:38:18] to do
[1:38:21] let me tell you who your best friend and
[1:38:23] your best buddy
[1:38:25] better be
[1:38:27] sister Connie would you stand up
[1:38:33] right there is my best buddy
[1:38:37] right there's my best friend
[1:38:39] right there knows everything that there
[1:38:41] is to know about me we do not keep
[1:38:43] secrets and I don't hide nothing from
[1:38:45] her
[1:38:46] come on
[1:38:57] we have raised three wonderful children
[1:39:00] and now attempting to help raise six
[1:39:02] more grandchildren we will do our very
[1:39:05] best to spoil our grandbabies
[1:39:07] that's what the prophet told us to do
[1:39:09] and I plan on doing what the prophet
[1:39:11] said do
[1:39:16] I didn't have to read Dr Dobson's book
[1:39:18] about how to raise a child
[1:39:21] foreign
[1:39:22] and I don't believe in children
[1:39:23] misbehaving
[1:39:25] in church out of church in school I
[1:39:27] believe they ought to act right your job
[1:39:30] is to raise your children and train them
[1:39:31] up
[1:39:34] you don't have to raise a brat
[1:39:37] little brats become big brats and big
[1:39:41] brats can't get jobs and can't
[1:39:45] can't have relationships that work out
[1:39:48] because they never got it fixed at two
[1:39:51] years old
[1:39:52] [Music]
[1:39:54] oh my brother Ron that's so cute what
[1:39:57] you're calling cute is actually a
[1:39:59] deficiency
[1:40:04] just a couple more minutes
[1:40:08] [Applause]
[1:40:22] how many teachers and school workers do
[1:40:25] we have here I'd like for you to stand
[1:40:26] thank you could you stand now whether
[1:40:29] you work in a cafeteria
[1:40:31] whether you're the
[1:40:36] give them a great big hand here
[1:40:50] these people don't go to school to make
[1:40:52] kids miserable
[1:40:56] they don't pick out on Tuesday Morning
[1:40:59] seven o'clock on their way to school I'm
[1:41:01] gonna make Johnny so miserable today I'm
[1:41:04] going to treat him like dirt I'm going
[1:41:07] to teach him a lesson of life
[1:41:15] these people got gifts in their life
[1:41:16] they can put up with kids
[1:41:19] that old brother Ron can't put up with
[1:41:21] you
[1:41:26] I didn't mind diapering my children but
[1:41:28] I'm not necessarily wanting to adopt her
[1:41:31] yours
[1:41:35] and these people picked a profession
[1:41:38] knowing that every one of the children
[1:41:40] that sat in front of them
[1:41:42] some of us not going to get it but one
[1:41:44] day the light will come on
[1:41:48] you've heard the story told about Thomas
[1:41:50] Edison
[1:41:54] he got sent home a letter
[1:41:58] and they didn't want him back again
[1:41:59] because he was mentally
[1:42:02] she taught that boy
[1:42:04] and that boy became a genius
[1:42:09] but it didn't have to be that way
[1:42:12] can you imagine being the coach that
[1:42:15] looked down the line of men that was
[1:42:18] setting before him eighth graders
[1:42:19] setting before him and he picks Johnny
[1:42:23] doe over Michael Jordan
[1:42:27] yeah yeah come on come on come on
[1:42:32] if you don't know who Michael Jordan is
[1:42:33] God bless you
[1:42:35] thank you for living in a cave somewhere
[1:42:37] another
[1:42:48] I would imagine I would imagine that guy
[1:42:51] has looked back many times and thought
[1:42:54] what we could have had
[1:42:56] if I'd only took a little time to
[1:42:58] develop him
[1:43:12] so no matter where you're at listen to
[1:43:14] this sermon
[1:43:15] give your pastor a break
[1:43:25] give him a break
[1:43:27] not everybody's Angels ready for the
[1:43:30] rapture
[1:43:35] some of them has been sent right
[1:43:37] straight from the region of Hell to
[1:43:40] torment the man's life and yet God put a
[1:43:45] special amount of Grace in his life
[1:43:50] because he knows there's a potential of
[1:43:52] God living on the inside of them
[1:43:58] and one day the light will come on if
[1:44:01] they stay there long enough and if the
[1:44:03] atmosphere will get just right
[1:44:06] the unbeliever will no longer be an
[1:44:09] unbeliever but he become a real believer
[1:44:12] the critic will be a praise worshiper
[1:44:15] [Applause]
[1:44:32] Hunter
[1:44:34] how many think you people was in your
[1:44:36] class that failed
[1:44:39] in law school
[1:44:47] they probably went to school eight ten
[1:44:49] years
[1:44:50] to become a lawyer
[1:44:52] there was days that you felt like
[1:44:53] quitting
[1:44:55] in that right
[1:44:56] there was days that you said I I've
[1:44:58] chose the wrong profession
[1:45:02] there was probably never a day that you
[1:45:03] said I want to be a school teacher
[1:45:14] Timmy
[1:45:15] I'm done I'm done this is all free now
[1:45:19] you wrestle with one of the greatest
[1:45:21] decisions it's ever been
[1:45:23] and you came in this office
[1:45:25] and the Lord spoke to you move
[1:45:28] Amy had already made up her mind
[1:45:35] but you see what benefits you
[1:45:37] now benefits your children
[1:45:41] and here you have a future
[1:45:43] daughter-in-law that's been baptized in
[1:45:44] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:45:47] Hallelujah
[1:45:50] and we'll marry in a few days I know it
[1:45:53] ain't been announced yet but I'm really
[1:45:55] happy to do it
[1:45:59] you guys haven't even asked me yet I
[1:46:01] don't think but
[1:46:16] might want to get that done
[1:46:27] leaving a job was hard
[1:46:30] leaving your homeless heart
[1:46:34] if it was easy everybody'd do it
[1:46:38] but you decided one day
[1:46:42] the cost out
[1:46:43] has benefits to it
[1:46:47] and I got to be where my children will
[1:46:48] live
[1:46:50] yes I don't lose my children
[1:46:52] there's a lot of things that you will
[1:46:53] live through but your children won't
[1:47:03] Devin you probably thought some of us
[1:47:05] was the craziest people on the Earth
[1:47:08] it was quite a little while before you
[1:47:10] heard me preach you thought the pastor
[1:47:12] here was Andrew
[1:47:13] you were right
[1:47:20] probably some of your friends probably
[1:47:22] said this to you are you serious you're
[1:47:24] going to church
[1:47:25] and you're enjoying it
[1:47:29] the other night I watched you rejoice
[1:47:31] and shouting
[1:47:34] you know he probably looked at yourself
[1:47:36] probably a year ago I'll never do that I
[1:47:38] never do that
[1:47:44] God made a difference in your life
[1:47:48] you could have went on in life and did
[1:47:51] the things that you were doing I don't
[1:47:52] know your history
[1:47:53] but I got a good idea
[1:47:56] but you could say this morning as I'm
[1:47:58] preaching this sermon
[1:47:59] didn't have to be that way
[1:48:13] TJ this is a lot better than playing pro
[1:48:15] ball
[1:48:17] being my next door neighbor is probably
[1:48:19] a little bit sometimes stinks but
[1:48:22] it's better than living beside of a
[1:48:24] palace somewhere another rich people
[1:48:25] that won't wave at you
[1:48:31] it didn't have to be that way but you
[1:48:34] made a choice
[1:48:37] Laura you made a choice
[1:48:40] you thought you were marrying a cowboy
[1:48:44] I remember that I remember she told me
[1:48:46] that
[1:48:47] I want to marry a cowboy
[1:48:50] you ride a horse
[1:48:58] and some of you thought Lord I'll never
[1:48:59] get it
[1:49:01] and yet you watch her rejoice
[1:49:04] there was a lot of probably a lot of
[1:49:05] people that thought you you'll never get
[1:49:07] it Ron you'll never get it you'll never
[1:49:09] make it
[1:49:11] brother homer I'm going to finish with
[1:49:13] this
[1:49:14] brother Homer said I was going to live
[1:49:16] right for at least six months because
[1:49:18] everybody told me I couldn't
[1:49:22] remember him telling that
[1:49:26] he said I was determined I was going to
[1:49:28] live right for six months
[1:49:30] and somewhere in that six months he got
[1:49:32] the Holy Ghost
[1:49:35] and an attempt made and a preacher walks
[1:49:38] back and gives him a Bible and tells him
[1:49:39] you're going to need this
[1:49:43] nobody in that tent would have called
[1:49:45] Homer Frazier to be the pastor
[1:49:48] of this incredible Church
[1:49:55] but they couldn't see
[1:49:56] what God saw
[1:50:00] but they didn't have to be that way
[1:50:03] let's stand to our feet this morning
[1:50:09] can I close with One More Story
[1:50:13] I took a picture this morning of a a
[1:50:15] young man that
[1:50:16] about six two I don't have his weight in
[1:50:19] front of me
[1:50:21] he was driving a truck
[1:50:24] and he come up on two angels
[1:50:28] out of control and he hit the back of
[1:50:30] their car destroyed their car
[1:50:32] towed their car completely up on a bank
[1:50:37] 15 16 feet
[1:50:45] and what do you know he comes up and
[1:50:47] asks her are you guys all right and then
[1:50:49] he escapes the scene
[1:50:53] God would have two women to come and
[1:50:55] open the door
[1:50:56] and one of them would say I'm a nurse
[1:51:00] and I'm going to stay here with you
[1:51:02] those two nurses were not the only ones
[1:51:05] in the car
[1:51:06] there was actually angels
[1:51:09] that knows how to spin a car in a
[1:51:12] certain way
[1:51:13] almost like a roller coaster and then
[1:51:16] put you up on the side
[1:51:17] and then help you to catch your breath
[1:51:21] and Sister Evelyn got a scratch on her
[1:51:24] hand
[1:51:26] there's people that fall off of a
[1:51:28] three-foot ladder and die
[1:51:34] I know it because a friend of mine did
[1:51:36] it Standing On Top of three three foot
[1:51:38] ladder cigarette in his mouth
[1:51:40] fell down on that ladder and it crushed
[1:51:42] his ribs he walked out and finished his
[1:51:44] cigarette and he died before he got his
[1:51:45] cigarette done
[1:51:47] let me just say this to you if God is on
[1:51:50] your side
[1:51:53] it's the best choice that you ever made
[1:51:55] in your life
[1:51:57] God who is rich in Mercy
[1:52:07] maybe you're sitting here this morning
[1:52:10] maybe on the internet
[1:52:12] you're in between a choice
[1:52:14] [Music]
[1:52:18] sometimes decisions are forced
