[58:13] we'll turn over to the Book of Psalms
[58:15] chapter 37 and verse 3 and then also
[58:20] down to 2nd Peter chapter 3 and verse 9
[58:23] I'd like to speak to you today I'll help
[58:27] the Lord on on the bride's commitment
[58:32] the bride's commitment
[58:46] Psalms chapter 37 and verse verse 3 the
[58:51] Bible says here to trust in the Lord and
[58:54] do good and so shalt thou dwell in the
[58:57] land and verily thou shalt be fed
[59:02] delight thyself also in the Lord what a
[59:05] place to delight our self in not in
[59:08] Dairy Queen a Burger King but delight
[59:10] ourselves in the Lord and he shall give
[59:12] thee the desires of the heart commit thy
[59:16] way unto the Lord and Trust also in him
[59:18] and he shall bring it to pass let's read
[59:22] that last verse verse 5 commit thy way
[59:25] unto the Lord Trust also in him and he
[59:29] shall bring it to pass
[59:31] 2nd Peter chapter 3 and verse 9 the
[59:35] Bible says here the Lord is not slack
[59:39] concerning his promise as some men count
[59:42] slackness but is long-suffering to
[59:44] us-ward not willing that any should
[59:46] perish but that all should come to
[59:49] repentance but the day of the Lord will
[59:52] come as a thief in the night in which
[59:56] the heavens shall pass away with a great
[59:58] noise and the elements shall melt with
[1:00:00] fervent heat the earth also and the
[1:00:03] works that are therein shall be burned
[1:00:05] up seeing then that that all these
[1:00:09] things shall be dissolved what manner of
[1:00:12] persons ought ye to be in all holy
[1:00:15] conversation and godliness looking for
[1:00:18] and hasting unto the coming of the day
[1:00:20] of God wherein the heavens being on fire
[1:00:23] shall be dissolved and the elements
[1:00:26] shall melt with fervent heat
[1:00:28] nevertheless we according to his promise
[1:00:32] look for new heavens and a new earth
[1:00:35] wherein dwelleth righteousness may God
[1:00:39] bless his word he may be seated in the
[1:00:41] presence of the Lord where you are and
[1:00:43] commit your way into the Lord this
[1:00:45] morning so said we'd like to speak to
[1:00:47] you by the help of the Lord on the
[1:00:49] bride's commitment now commitment is the
[1:00:52] trait of sincere and steadfast fix
[1:00:55] of purpose it is the act of bonding
[1:01:00] oneself to a course of action commitment
[1:01:03] describes the person who is willing to
[1:01:05] give their time and energy to something
[1:01:09] that they believe in and I believe that
[1:01:10] is that is truly the bride's commitment
[1:01:13] today is this word of God
[1:01:15] it describes us as as Christians as us
[1:01:18] his sons and daughters of God that the
[1:01:21] word commitment describes who we are so
[1:01:23] I like for just a little bit of time to
[1:01:25] speak on the thing that describes you
[1:01:28] and and and I trust that these things
[1:01:31] will these things will stir your heart
[1:01:34] that these things will describe a people
[1:01:37] that are willing to give their time
[1:01:39] willing to give their energies to the
[1:01:41] things in which they believe in this
[1:01:45] message that has been delivered to the
[1:01:47] bride of Jesus Christ is not just not
[1:01:50] just her Reformation but it is a
[1:01:52] transforming message that has changed it
[1:01:56] has changed and transformed our thinking
[1:01:58] into his thinking that we no longer have
[1:02:01] our thoughts but we take on his thoughts
[1:02:04] as the Bible says in Philippians 2 and 5
[1:02:07] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:02:10] in Christ Jesus now notice what the word
[1:02:14] the word about what the Bible is saying
[1:02:16] there that Christ humbled himself and
[1:02:19] here we take on the Spirit of Christ in
[1:02:22] humility and we commit ourselves to have
[1:02:26] his mind and then committing ourselves
[1:02:28] to have his mind we no longer take on
[1:02:31] our mind we don't longer take on our
[1:02:34] thinking but we take on his thinking now
[1:02:37] the Bible says here in Hebrews 12 and 1
[1:02:40] we'll be looking over into the great
[1:02:43] cookbook today if you keep it handy and
[1:02:46] I and our notepad just to write these
[1:02:48] things down that you can go back over
[1:02:49] the Bible says here in Hebrews 12 and 1
[1:02:53] wherefore seeing we are we also are
[1:02:56] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[1:02:59] witnesses let us I'd every weight and
[1:03:02] the sin which dust so easily beset us
[1:03:05] and let us run with
[1:03:08] since the race that is set before us
[1:03:10] looking unto Jesus notice where our
[1:03:13] Aswan we we spoke this past week with
[1:03:16] the the young people and where our eyes
[1:03:18] should be by the way of a video
[1:03:20] conference on where our eyes should be
[1:03:23] but notice young people where our eyes
[1:03:25] are to be it's looking unto Jesus it's
[1:03:28] not on the world it's not on what Fox
[1:03:30] News is saying or seeing it in saying
[1:03:32] but we're looking unto Jesus the author
[1:03:35] and the finisher of our faith
[1:03:38] notice what he did who for the joy that
[1:03:41] was set before him endured the cross for
[1:03:44] the joy of it despised the shame for the
[1:03:48] joy of it and is set down at the right
[1:03:50] hand of the throne of God verse 3 for
[1:03:52] consider him that endured such
[1:03:54] contradiction of sinners against himself
[1:03:58] lest ye be wearied and faint in your
[1:04:01] minds consider him consider this one who
[1:04:05] for the joy for for your sakes endured
[1:04:09] the cross of despising the shame in
[1:04:12] considering him in the greatness of who
[1:04:15] he is as God the Son of God the heir of
[1:04:18] all things in his offices of prophet and
[1:04:21] priest and King as the Saviour of lost
[1:04:23] sinner's the leader and commander of the
[1:04:25] people consider him as the Apostle the
[1:04:28] high priest have I profess and consider
[1:04:32] him in his human nature consider him in
[1:04:35] his conversation on earth and what he
[1:04:38] did and suffered from men consider him
[1:04:40] how that in his nature he was pure and
[1:04:43] holy in his conversation harmless in a
[1:04:47] sin and in his manner meek and lowly who
[1:04:50] went about doing good to the souls of
[1:04:52] men and at last suffered and died and is
[1:04:55] now glorified first we want to consider
[1:04:58] him today we look telling this
[1:05:00] commitment consider him consider him in
[1:05:03] his commitment consider him and his
[1:05:06] commitment to his chosen to you and here
[1:05:09] in your life and the days that you know
[1:05:12] that there's nobody else around but you
[1:05:14] consider him that he's always there
[1:05:17] consider him when you can't get to the
[1:05:18] doctor that he's your doctor when you
[1:05:21] can't get to that when you can't get to
[1:05:23] the grocery store that he will supply
[1:05:26] and he will fear your refrigerator
[1:05:28] consider him when you can't get to the
[1:05:30] pasture that he is your burden bearer
[1:05:33] consider him and his commitment to you
[1:05:36] that he will not leave you that he will
[1:05:38] not forsake you but he'll be with you
[1:05:40] even in you to the end of the world that
[1:05:43] his counsel is true that his ways are
[1:05:45] perfect that he is the utmost and the up
[1:05:48] and the greatest one that you could ever
[1:05:50] turn your eyes upon for the Bible says
[1:05:53] in Psalms 33 and 11 the counsel of the
[1:05:56] Lord stands forever the thoughts of his
[1:06:00] heart to all generations blessed is the
[1:06:04] nation whose God is the Lord and the
[1:06:07] people whom he hath chosen for his own
[1:06:10] inheritance the Lord looketh from heaven
[1:06:14] he behold of all the sons of man he
[1:06:17] beholds all the sons of man from the
[1:06:20] place of his habitation he looketh upon
[1:06:23] all the inhabitants of the earth he
[1:06:25] fastest their heart alike he considereth
[1:06:28] all their works youth you see today that
[1:06:31] God is obligated to his word he's
[1:06:34] obligated to keep what he said in the
[1:06:36] things that he said that he would bring
[1:06:38] to pass he promised it he'll make it to
[1:06:41] happen he promised then it Aaron it'll
[1:06:44] show up you see for we know that he is
[1:06:47] committed into bringing his word to pass
[1:06:49] you see as a human being you try to work
[1:06:52] yourself up and try to figure out how
[1:06:54] God is going to work all the details out
[1:06:56] and you try to figure out how this is
[1:06:58] going to happen and how that is going to
[1:07:00] happen that God's got to do this and
[1:07:02] God's got to do that to bring it to pass
[1:07:04] and what you're doing is you're locking
[1:07:06] God up in a box that that you're saying
[1:07:09] that God's got to do this and God's got
[1:07:11] to do that he's God he's a God of
[1:07:14] miracles he's a God of impossibilities
[1:07:16] he's a god that looks past what doctors
[1:07:19] say he's a god that looks past what we
[1:07:22] see he's a God that is committed to his
[1:07:25] word and he's a God that changes not for
[1:07:28] the Bible says that he is not a man that
[1:07:30] he should lie for the Bible said in
[1:07:34] Isaiah 55 that so shall my word be they
[1:07:37] goeth forth out of my mouth that I will
[1:07:40] accomplish it shall not return unto me
[1:07:43] void but it shall accomplish that which
[1:07:45] I sent it to do now God has sent a word
[1:07:48] to you in this hour and he has committed
[1:07:51] that word for a such a time as this for
[1:07:54] a purpose that he has in store in your
[1:07:57] own life and God is committed in to
[1:08:00] bring that word and bringing it to pass
[1:08:03] in your life you see he is determined to
[1:08:06] bring forth life you see if there if
[1:08:09] there is an air that is shut up in your
[1:08:12] loins it's got to come forth and bring
[1:08:15] forth life because God is the author of
[1:08:17] life because God is not the author of
[1:08:20] death it's the enemy that wants to kill
[1:08:23] it's the enemy that wants to steal it's
[1:08:26] the enemy that wants to destroy but
[1:08:28] God's purpose will never be defeated for
[1:08:33] he is committed in bringing his word to
[1:08:36] pass if there is a miracle that is on
[1:08:39] the way there is a people that will have
[1:08:41] faith for that miracle to be established
[1:08:44] in if God has a rapture for a people
[1:08:48] there will be a people to take a rapture
[1:08:50] God is committed in bringing his word to
[1:08:54] pass and right here in the midst of
[1:08:57] Satan's Eden when the world is in chaos
[1:08:59] and when Satan is the king of the world
[1:09:02] God's seed will prevail
[1:09:04] I'd say to you today that you are God's
[1:09:07] seed and you will overcome you will make
[1:09:11] it you will be victorious you will not
[1:09:13] be defeated you will not be cast down
[1:09:16] you will not be perplexed you will not
[1:09:18] be destroyed but you will overcome you
[1:09:23] say what about if I fail you say you say
[1:09:26] what about if I fail you see God has not
[1:09:28] come to me when I failed it says Andrew
[1:09:31] I'm going to divorce you because you
[1:09:33] have failed you see he has a lasting
[1:09:36] commitment to me there's a lot but
[1:09:40] here nah but whether I love him but
[1:09:44] whether I feel him or whether I know
[1:09:46] he's there he is committed to me
[1:09:49] hallelujah and just because I failed him
[1:09:53] Oh Tuesday or I fail him on Wednesday
[1:09:56] God is not riding out a law of
[1:09:58] divorcement to you but he has committed
[1:10:00] to you that he will never leave you and
[1:10:03] he will not forsake you he's a god that
[1:10:06] is obligated to the word you see and you
[1:10:09] commit that word God have committed that
[1:10:11] word to the ground in the Garden of Eden
[1:10:14] and every one of those seeds would bring
[1:10:17] forth other kind and you watch as the
[1:10:20] Holy Ghost goes to moving in your life
[1:10:22] and goes to working over nature that
[1:10:25] it's the Holy Ghost that brings it to
[1:10:27] pass you committed to the ground you
[1:10:30] committed to the ground of your heart
[1:10:31] and you watch as God is committed to
[1:10:35] bring it to pass you see God is our
[1:10:38] great provider God is our great
[1:10:40] sustainer God is the God that is with
[1:10:43] you in your tour mo you see God's got
[1:10:46] everything already worked out you and I
[1:10:48] try to walk into a building and we look
[1:10:51] for the exit door where we know how to
[1:10:53] get out but God's already got your exit
[1:10:55] plan figured out he is committed in
[1:10:59] bringing you out in this day he is our
[1:11:02] great provider you remember we just
[1:11:04] heard about winter when brother Wayne
[1:11:06] was here that when David hit it over
[1:11:08] that Hill Tomika life he didn't go down
[1:11:11] there with a stone in his pocket he went
[1:11:14] down there and picked up stones because
[1:11:16] in that valley was the same valley that
[1:11:20] joshua had been in and joshua chapter 10
[1:11:23] when he stopped the Sun and God rain
[1:11:25] down hailstones on top of the Assyrians
[1:11:29] and the enemy there and David walked
[1:11:32] down into that Valley and he grabbed
[1:11:34] five of those smooth stones those stones
[1:11:37] were from another world you see it and
[1:11:40] walked down in that Valley with stones
[1:11:42] he went down there to get those fed
[1:11:44] those stones that were proving stones
[1:11:46] those stones had killed the enemy before
[1:11:49] and day
[1:11:50] it'd be in the annointed walked down
[1:11:52] into that Valley and grabbed those
[1:11:54] proven stones you see what the last
[1:11:57] mistake was is that he allowed David to
[1:12:01] get to those stones the stones that have
[1:12:03] been placed in your hands are not man's
[1:12:05] ideas their message stones and they have
[1:12:09] been proven they have been anointed
[1:12:11] hallelujah these stones have been
[1:12:13] committed into your trust for you to
[1:12:16] take them and slay your tides the
[1:12:19] enemy's mistake is that he has allowed
[1:12:22] you to get to these message stones whoo
[1:12:26] hallelujah hallelujah when the Bible
[1:12:32] says in Isaiah chapter 22 verse 22 and
[1:12:38] the key of the house of David will I lay
[1:12:42] upon his shoulder so he saw so he shall
[1:12:47] open it and none shall shut and he shot
[1:12:51] a nun so open but where is the key
[1:12:53] brother Branham says in the church age
[1:12:55] book where is that key that is placed in
[1:12:59] the house of David that I will lay upon
[1:13:01] his shoulder he said where is that key
[1:13:03] he said it's on his shoulder it's on his
[1:13:07] shoulder but what does the shoulder have
[1:13:10] to do with it read in Isaiah 9 and 6 and
[1:13:13] the government shall be upon his
[1:13:15] shoulder but what does this mean the
[1:13:18] answer is this the phrase government
[1:13:21] upon his shoulder comes from the wedding
[1:13:23] ceremony of the east when the bride has
[1:13:26] been committed to the groom hallelujah
[1:13:29] that she takes off her veil and places
[1:13:34] it over on the groom's shoulder
[1:13:36] signifying that not only is she under
[1:13:40] his Dominion that she has transferred
[1:13:44] her rights to him that he is the head
[1:13:47] but also that he bears the
[1:13:49] responsibility and the care and that he
[1:13:52] alone and no one else no other man no
[1:13:56] other power has any right and
[1:13:57] responsibility
[1:13:59] and that beloved is the key of David God
[1:14:02] being sovereign he foreknew by divine
[1:14:04] decree exactly who would be in his body
[1:14:09] he chose her she did not choose him he
[1:14:14] called her she did not come on her own
[1:14:17] he died for her he washed her in his own
[1:14:20] blood he paid the price for her she
[1:14:22] belongs to him and he to him alone
[1:14:26] she is wholly committed to him and he
[1:14:34] accepts the obligation she is wholly
[1:14:39] committed to him and he accepts the
[1:14:44] obligation he is her head for Christ is
[1:14:48] the head of his church notice when she
[1:14:53] takes off her veil and she places it
[1:14:56] over on his shoulder
[1:14:59] it is signified that all that I am I am
[1:15:04] committing to your trust and he is
[1:15:06] saying that all that you are I am
[1:15:10] committed and taking care of you I am
[1:15:12] committed in providing for you I am
[1:15:15] committed in taking care of you whoa
[1:15:18] hallelujah
[1:15:19] I'd say we could dismiss right now let's
[1:15:22] hey we done had church for this guy when
[1:15:26] you have committed your trust over to
[1:15:29] him you saying I got this I've got this
[1:15:34] do you realize today that you are
[1:15:37] placing your veil over all top of Poppa
[1:15:40] God and he's big enough he's committed
[1:15:45] enough he's strong enough he's good
[1:15:48] enough I don't know that's a correct
[1:15:50] English enough but he's right enough
[1:15:52] he's powerful enough he's anointed
[1:15:54] enough he's committed enough hallelujah
[1:15:57] he's the Almighty he's not backing off
[1:16:01] of his promises he is committed to you
[1:16:07] whoa
[1:16:09] when you look at two lovebirds when they
[1:16:13] start coming down to a spot when they're
[1:16:17] coming down to a spot of engagement and
[1:16:19] they take on their marriage vows and you
[1:16:22] watch those true they are committing
[1:16:25] themselves to one another they're
[1:16:28] committing all that they are it's not
[1:16:31] that you're saying that all that I have
[1:16:33] is yours and all that you have is mine
[1:16:35] but you're saying you're saying
[1:16:39] everything that I have I'm giving you
[1:16:43] half of the kingdom you see marriage is
[1:16:46] not marriage marriage is give-and-take
[1:16:49] but there's some people that are more
[1:16:52] take than they are give they're always
[1:16:55] wanting to take from you they're always
[1:16:57] wanting to rob from you they're always
[1:16:59] taking but they're never given but
[1:17:01] marriage is a little bit of both
[1:17:04] brothers it's not her always taken but
[1:17:09] it's you having to give your will over
[1:17:11] you see there are some people that are
[1:17:13] definitely a whole lot lower than take
[1:17:15] their whole lot more take than they are
[1:17:16] give but if you watch those two young
[1:17:19] people as you watch them as they take on
[1:17:22] their vows that if they've got the
[1:17:24] mindset of walking into this marriage
[1:17:26] that if this one don't work well I'll
[1:17:28] just get another this ain't like a pair
[1:17:31] of underwear that when it gets worn out
[1:17:33] you can put on another one if you walk
[1:17:35] into a marriage thinking well if this
[1:17:38] don't work I'll just get a divorce I
[1:17:40] will show you some marriage a marriage
[1:17:43] that will not last if you walk into a
[1:17:46] job and say well if this job don't pay
[1:17:49] out and they don't give me a paycheck
[1:17:50] and if I get fired well I'll just go get
[1:17:52] another job I'll show you somebody
[1:17:54] that's not committed to the job you see
[1:17:59] when that marriage is taking place when
[1:18:02] you say for better or worse you better
[1:18:05] mean better or for worse because you
[1:18:08] don't know what's coming down the road I
[1:18:10] was speaking to sister Whitney when her
[1:18:13] and Davey were in their father when they
[1:18:15] were in their first steps of engagement
[1:18:17] and I looked at her she asked me what I
[1:18:19] thought I said do not make the come
[1:18:22] but unless you're willing that if this
[1:18:25] man is paralyzed interrex
[1:18:28] wrecked up or different things that you
[1:18:31] are willing to take care of him I didn't
[1:18:35] realize what I was saying would become a
[1:18:38] reality for sister Whitney but you
[1:18:41] watched as sister Whitney it was more
[1:18:44] than a love through the accident it was
[1:18:47] a commitment there she was committed to
[1:18:50] him on bad days and on good taste she
[1:18:54] was committed to him when it didn't feel
[1:18:56] good she was committed to him in the
[1:18:58] hospital he was committed to him in the
[1:19:01] rehab she was committed to him you see
[1:19:07] you see people that come together whoa
[1:19:09] we got to get married we're so in love
[1:19:12] but they're not committed to one another
[1:19:15] you will see a marriage that will never
[1:19:18] work young people I hope you hear me
[1:19:21] it's got to be a commitment that if they
[1:19:26] are ripped up in life if they're torn up
[1:19:29] in life that you're committed to them no
[1:19:32] matter what comes
[1:19:33] you see whoo now I'm gonna drop some to
[1:19:37] you God is committed to you whether
[1:19:41] you're in health or whether you're in
[1:19:43] sickness he's committed to you he's
[1:19:45] committed to you whether you're poor or
[1:19:47] whether you're rich whether you feel
[1:19:49] good whether you feel bad God's
[1:19:51] committed to you well the Bible says in
[1:19:57] Proverbs 6 and 30:16 3 commit thy works
[1:20:01] under the LORD thy God under the Lord
[1:20:04] and thy thoughts shall be established I
[1:20:08] wonder
[1:20:10] during this farm during this time when
[1:20:15] you're not able to come to the house of
[1:20:17] God when you're not able to be here
[1:20:20] you're not able to come to the altar and
[1:20:23] pertain or tell me the things that are
[1:20:25] pertaining to your life laid upon the
[1:20:28] later form the pastor's shoulder then he
[1:20:30] may pray for you and lay his hand upon
[1:20:32] you wonder in these moments
[1:20:36] what are you really hungry for what are
[1:20:39] the things that you're committed to what
[1:20:41] are the things that you're longing for
[1:20:42] what your hunger for darkness
[1:20:45] did your hunger for movies did you
[1:20:48] hunger for restaurants did you hunger
[1:20:50] for social parties of gathering together
[1:20:53] did you hunger for Matt March Madness
[1:20:55] did you hunger for ball games
[1:20:57] did you hunger for concerts Christian
[1:20:59] concerts or did you hunger for church
[1:21:03] did you feed your souls during this
[1:21:06] crisis did you feed your life during
[1:21:09] this crisis were you committed to the
[1:21:11] calls his word is always available
[1:21:14] restaurants aren't available movies
[1:21:17] aren't available concerts aren't
[1:21:19] available but the Word of God is
[1:21:21] available the Holy Spirit is available
[1:21:25] did you feed your soul is a God that has
[1:21:29] provided everything that you can ask of
[1:21:31] everything that you have need of you
[1:21:33] don't need me to lay my hands on you yes
[1:21:36] it is commission that I lay my hands on
[1:21:38] the sick and they shall recover but what
[1:21:40] about you what about you you're
[1:21:44] constantly sending notes to the pastor
[1:21:46] pay for this one pay for that one what
[1:21:49] about you committing your life to prayer
[1:21:51] I'm preaching to you today I'm preaching
[1:21:56] to you today that only inside of you
[1:21:58] he's a committed trust that whether
[1:22:01] Andrew Spencer is or helps whether you
[1:22:04] have the opportunity to text me or not
[1:22:06] whether you have the opportunity to call
[1:22:09] on call on brother on or not that you
[1:22:12] have a committed trust that you have the
[1:22:16] ability and the access of prayer to
[1:22:18] reach the throne are you committed are
[1:22:26] you committed I know this is I know this
[1:22:29] is a little bit down-home but let it be
[1:22:31] down-home if it puts you in rapture in
[1:22:33] tradition let it put you in rapture and
[1:22:35] condition be committed in this time last
[1:22:39] weekend we spoke to you on Satan's
[1:22:41] nightmare and fill-in your mouth with
[1:22:43] the Word of God it's
[1:22:45] filling your mouth with ideas and what
[1:22:47] you feel and what you see but filling
[1:22:49] your mouth with the Word of God
[1:22:52] brother Branham said it over over again
[1:22:56] he said only by your confession can you
[1:22:59] be saved
[1:22:59] he said notice that's the most powerful
[1:23:03] weapon that God put in the hand a man
[1:23:08] the most powerful weapon that God has
[1:23:12] put in the hand of man is a committal
[1:23:15] and the confession
[1:23:18] it'll do it every time if you believe it
[1:23:21] accepted on those basis and believe it
[1:23:23] and stay with it and keep confessing it
[1:23:25] the greatest weapon that's placed in
[1:23:28] your hand is a committal to God Lorraine
[1:23:34] says and he cares do you care he said I
[1:23:37] found among some people a lack of
[1:23:39] sincerity and I wonder why here was one
[1:23:43] man that was healed purpose or one one
[1:23:45] man in particular I'm speaking of the
[1:23:48] man had a great affliction and he was
[1:23:50] healed this night standing there and
[1:23:52] before we left five days the affliction
[1:23:55] the affliction was back to him again
[1:23:57] because in the presence of the Holy
[1:23:59] Spirit he took that off of him just like
[1:24:03] it did this young woman while ago out
[1:24:06] here in the yard and the young man last
[1:24:09] night but there must be a deep sincerity
[1:24:13] to know that the God that can take it
[1:24:16] away from you now with that same
[1:24:20] anointing can keep it away from you
[1:24:22] you're seeing then the Holy Spirit spoke
[1:24:25] to me one morning about May light and
[1:24:27] said get up on the platform in somewhere
[1:24:29] and bring these people up there and make
[1:24:32] them confess everything they did before
[1:24:34] you pray for them see the deepness of
[1:24:38] sincerity you see if you're committed to
[1:24:41] God and leave it there you can't plant a
[1:24:44] seed and go out the next day and pick it
[1:24:46] up see if you got a corn stalk of corn
[1:24:48] but you got to leave it there
[1:24:50] you gotta commit it to God and when you
[1:24:53] committed to God he will keep it away
[1:24:56] what would happen
[1:24:58] if we go to committing ourselves during
[1:25:01] this hour during this crisis during this
[1:25:04] moment what would take place if we go to
[1:25:06] committing ourselves to God today is
[1:25:09] about challenging you to believe to go
[1:25:11] higher to take a step higher to live at
[1:25:14] the next level to be committed to the
[1:25:16] message that's been delivered to you
[1:25:19] this is not a Pentecostal message this
[1:25:21] is an eagle message to take you higher
[1:25:27] stop floating with the rest of the world
[1:25:30] but raised above raised above what you
[1:25:35] see raised above the denominations yes
[1:25:38] the world's having their drive-ins and
[1:25:40] I'm not against drive-ins I'm not saying
[1:25:42] that yes the world is doing that but we
[1:25:44] don't want to be committed to what the
[1:25:46] world's doing we want to be committed to
[1:25:50] God what kind of people should we be if
[1:25:57] the Holy Spirit has you so embodied or
[1:26:00] empowered that you don't lose that you
[1:26:03] don't use your own thoughts that you
[1:26:05] don't use your own mind that you don't
[1:26:07] use your own opinions but the Holy
[1:26:09] Spirit has you so built unto your
[1:26:11] thoughts and your being is God's Spirit
[1:26:14] expressing itself through you what kind
[1:26:17] of church would we be what kind of
[1:26:20] people would we be this morning if
[1:26:23] Brandon tabernacle this morning was so
[1:26:24] filled with the presence of God why when
[1:26:27] you don't even use your own mind don't
[1:26:29] even use your own thoughts no didn't
[1:26:31] even use no you merely old humility of
[1:26:34] your own but just to be led by the
[1:26:37] spirit what kind of people would we be
[1:26:40] if we were so embodied with the Holy
[1:26:45] Ghost if anyone should be shining in
[1:26:47] this moment it should be the bride of
[1:26:49] Jesus Christ this is a time to rise and
[1:26:53] trim your laugh for the bridegroom is
[1:26:55] coming for the random said that the real
[1:26:58] wick on the inside of that candle is a
[1:27:01] believer that believer has fire on one
[1:27:04] end and he's got on the other end it's
[1:27:06] dipped into the order and he's
[1:27:08] constantly burning
[1:27:10] constantly in the oil of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:12] he's constantly staying there hallelujah
[1:27:15] what a church what a power what a place
[1:27:19] to be in the place that God ordained us
[1:27:22] to be it's a time that we arise and trim
[1:27:25] off the world trim off the fashions of
[1:27:28] the world trim off the things of the
[1:27:30] world and get ready through the hours
[1:27:33] ahead the Bible says in Hebrews six and
[1:27:37] 11 and we desire that every one of you
[1:27:41] do the same show the same diligence to
[1:27:44] the full assurance of hope under the end
[1:27:47] that you be not slothful that you be not
[1:27:51] inactive but followers of them who
[1:27:54] through faith and patience inherit the
[1:27:56] promises now you be not slothful that
[1:28:02] you be not be not slack be not inactive
[1:28:06] but be committed you see people that
[1:28:10] always want to change they want changes
[1:28:12] over here they want changes over there
[1:28:14] they want God to do a work in their life
[1:28:16] they were got areas in which they want
[1:28:18] God to do something but without a
[1:28:20] commitment nothing is ever going to
[1:28:22] happen you see a procrastinator is only
[1:28:26] good when they're threatened they're
[1:28:27] only good when they're put on the spot
[1:28:29] well I'll just wait till this happens or
[1:28:31] I'll just wait till the last minute and
[1:28:33] I'll get it done because they are
[1:28:35] procrastinators there are people there
[1:28:38] are preachers in this message that only
[1:28:41] study when it's their time to be called
[1:28:43] upon the preach it is old there are
[1:28:46] people in this message that never spend
[1:28:48] their time in the word only when they
[1:28:51] know they're going to church because
[1:28:53] they're not committed they're
[1:28:58] procrastinating well I'll just wait for
[1:29:00] the preacher I'll just wait for the
[1:29:02] perfect time and they're procrastinating
[1:29:04] and they're only good when you put their
[1:29:08] position on the spot you see God don't
[1:29:14] like laziness and I don't like laziness
[1:29:16] and if you are lazy God can't use you
[1:29:20] there are some people
[1:29:22] that have never thrown themselves said
[1:29:24] anything
[1:29:25] they'll put offshore they'll put all
[1:29:27] themselves into everything they want the
[1:29:29] ass this is the age of our iPhone iMac
[1:29:32] and iPad and all these things and it's
[1:29:35] all about me me me me me ah ah but
[1:29:38] they're never concerned or committed to
[1:29:41] God they've never given themselves given
[1:29:44] their all to anything so how can they
[1:29:47] give their all to God when they don't
[1:29:49] even know how to do it in the natural
[1:29:51] you see a people that have never been
[1:29:55] committed and some of the most
[1:29:56] uncommitted people are the most talented
[1:29:59] people that I know of
[1:30:00] because talented people will lay upon
[1:30:03] their talents and use their talent to
[1:30:05] cover up their lack of commitment and
[1:30:08] because they're talented enough to get
[1:30:10] by they will aimlessly run through life
[1:30:13] and make themselves see that they're
[1:30:15] committed you're not committed you're
[1:30:18] just talented enough to get by you never
[1:30:21] know what you could have been if you
[1:30:23] threw all of yourself or really
[1:30:26] committed all of your life you're just
[1:30:28] talented enough to get by they're just
[1:30:32] acting apart they're going through the
[1:30:34] motions they just want to smack on the
[1:30:36] back from the preacher but if the
[1:30:38] preacher can't be there shake their hand
[1:30:41] talk to them and encourage them they're
[1:30:44] not committed well I'll just get back to
[1:30:47] church when the government says we can
[1:30:49] get back to church I've been having but
[1:30:51] I have been having church every day but
[1:30:54] the Allen's been working at my house
[1:30:56] every day I walk out there for the
[1:30:59] Allens listen in the toilet ain't been
[1:31:00] around and studying these brothers and
[1:31:02] sisters they're in they are in this
[1:31:06] message they didn't come to talk about
[1:31:09] the message they come to get in the
[1:31:11] message they're committed they're not
[1:31:15] just acting apart but you see some
[1:31:18] people are never sold out to the idea
[1:31:21] they're never truly born again well I'm
[1:31:25] just doing this because they're only
[1:31:28] serving God for the benefits
[1:31:31] some people only pay their ties because
[1:31:34] they know they know that God has a
[1:31:37] blessing that is behind their times but
[1:31:41] they never do it because out of the
[1:31:45] abundance of the heart they only do it
[1:31:48] they only do it because they want the
[1:31:52] benefit package you ever been around
[1:31:55] somebody that's a whole lot better on
[1:31:56] paper than they are in person you get
[1:31:59] some people you get some people on a
[1:32:02] computer or man they're a bulldog
[1:32:03] they'll rip your head off they'll tell
[1:32:05] you what you are what you should be and
[1:32:07] what you ought to be doing they'll tell
[1:32:08] you how to preach they'll tell you what
[1:32:10] you need to preach they'll tell you how
[1:32:11] to speak they'll tell you how not to
[1:32:13] speak they'll tell you all these things
[1:32:14] but get them in person they once was a
[1:32:17] bulldog on the other side of that
[1:32:18] computer but there are wiener dog when
[1:32:20] they get in front of you because you see
[1:32:21] they are only a paper dragon they're not
[1:32:26] committed to what they're really saying
[1:32:29] they are some people can sure talk a
[1:32:32] good talk but they can never walk what
[1:32:34] they say they're not committed to the
[1:32:37] cause and they're not committed to this
[1:32:39] message that God gives them all they can
[1:32:43] tell you how to preach but they never
[1:32:45] preach today in their sight in their
[1:32:46] life they never got up and testified oh
[1:32:49] if I was you I'd preach it like this way
[1:32:51] I want to know if you've testified to
[1:32:53] the milk man to the bread man to the UPS
[1:32:56] man to the FedEx man and once you but
[1:32:58] not testify to them then I might give
[1:33:01] you a chance to tell me your testimony
[1:33:04] some people hold mouth they'll tell you
[1:33:07] everything they got on their mind
[1:33:09] you better save what you got on your
[1:33:11] mind you may need that tension some
[1:33:16] people they're a whole lot better on
[1:33:18] paper you can look at stats of of
[1:33:20] individuals of sports man on paper on
[1:33:24] paper they should be outperforming other
[1:33:27] people but when they get in person
[1:33:31] they're never living up to the statistic
[1:33:36] in which they should be living
[1:33:38] I know people personally that don't have
[1:33:41] an education that will outwork
[1:33:44] form out thrive people that have degrees
[1:33:47] people that have walls of degrees and
[1:33:51] people that don't have an education will
[1:33:54] outwork filled out serve them out I'll
[1:33:57] do them because they are willing to put
[1:34:00] the effort in they're willing to grind
[1:34:02] it out willing to get in did the
[1:34:04] shoulders go to get their feet dirty and
[1:34:06] dive in that's the kind of people that
[1:34:11] God is looking for look at our prophet
[1:34:15] seventh grade education mark made fun of
[1:34:19] but he stood he stood in the face of the
[1:34:24] ecclesiastical giants of the day he had
[1:34:27] no peer that he could look to he was the
[1:34:30] only man that said he'd met an angel he
[1:34:33] didn't have an education they made fun
[1:34:35] of him because he said his hits and his
[1:34:37] hates and his hopes and his boats and
[1:34:39] different things he said he said Pope
[1:34:41] read it sent a pope in and they made fun
[1:34:44] of him but they could not stand against
[1:34:47] the enemy because they were not truly
[1:34:52] committed you look at the rich young
[1:34:56] ruler young people we point to the rich
[1:34:59] young ruler we look at him look at the
[1:35:02] leadership look at his influence and
[1:35:04] look at those Saints but look at it this
[1:35:05] morning
[1:35:06] he was unable to commit all the way sure
[1:35:11] he could do all the easy things sure I
[1:35:14] could serve God when it please his mom
[1:35:16] and daddy sure I can serve God but when
[1:35:19] things are in my corner sure I can serve
[1:35:20] God anybody can do easy things but the
[1:35:24] rich young ruler refused to make the
[1:35:28] investment you see he was born he was
[1:35:32] born to be and said at the throne that
[1:35:35] sit there at Jesus's feet but he allowed
[1:35:38] the distract myths of life and the
[1:35:41] monies of life and hid the the cause of
[1:35:44] Jesus and the cause of the commandments
[1:35:47] of God became irrelevant to the cause
[1:35:50] that he was living in
[1:35:53] you see it had become it had become so
[1:35:57] irrelevant to him because he was unable
[1:36:01] to commit to the things of God you see
[1:36:06] you cannot reap where you have not sown
[1:36:08] and you cannot sew where you're not
[1:36:12] willing to go but where you're willing
[1:36:14] to go you can reap there where you're
[1:36:17] willing to sew it you say I want a
[1:36:19] blessing in my family you say I wanna
[1:36:22] know anything in my family you say I
[1:36:24] want to buy more power for prayer life
[1:36:25] in my family you say I want a greater
[1:36:27] walk with my family you will watch
[1:36:30] somebody that is totally devoted totally
[1:36:33] dedicated because they are willing to go
[1:36:35] to the extent to breathe a purpose to
[1:36:40] bless you watch somebody that's willing
[1:36:43] to channel the power or challenge the
[1:36:45] talent or challenge the gift that
[1:36:47] they've been placed in their life that
[1:36:48] they won't waste their talents and they
[1:36:50] won't waste their opportunities that
[1:36:52] they have been given in life but the
[1:36:54] random said that every generation gets a
[1:36:57] fresh chance at the word every one of
[1:37:00] you have been given an opportunity for
[1:37:03] the same message that I have been given
[1:37:05] this generation has an opportunity this
[1:37:08] morning but will you waste your talents
[1:37:11] and will you waste your opportunities
[1:37:13] Butler on sent me his devotion this
[1:37:16] morning and it was about it it was about
[1:37:19] a preacher in generations gone by and
[1:37:25] this man this preacher this clergyman
[1:37:28] was there and went to the bedside of a
[1:37:30] dying man mister dying man all of his
[1:37:33] life had never testified of the power of
[1:37:35] God he was a weak Christian he was real
[1:37:37] shy about telling about what Jesus did
[1:37:39] for him and as the clergyman was laying
[1:37:41] there sitting beside his bedside the
[1:37:44] dying man said oh I could just shop the
[1:37:47] prices of God he said why didn't you do
[1:37:49] it when you are living why didn't you
[1:37:54] why didn't you take the opportunity to
[1:37:57] testify and shout the praises of God
[1:37:59] when you had people surrounding you
[1:38:04] you say well you said well I don't I'm
[1:38:09] just too shy to do it
[1:38:11] some people will criticize you some
[1:38:14] people talk about the way you sing but
[1:38:16] they'll never get up they'll never do
[1:38:18] anything they'll never put in a hard
[1:38:20] day's worth of work so they don't know
[1:38:22] what it is to put in a hard day's worth
[1:38:24] of work but the Bible sentence and I say
[1:38:26] a 16-1 arise and shine a rising sound
[1:38:30] for the light is coming the glory of the
[1:38:32] Lord is risen upon me you see now is the
[1:38:35] time it is not the time to waste
[1:38:37] opportunities it is not the time to
[1:38:39] waste the talents that you've been given
[1:38:42] right now is the time to Bree right now
[1:38:44] is the time to dig here right now is the
[1:38:46] time to get committed to God this is a
[1:38:50] time that he's one to set you free this
[1:38:52] is the time where he's wanting to watch
[1:38:54] you work when you're all alone
[1:38:59] well Ron's got a statement my faith that
[1:39:03] ain't can't be tested can't be trusted
[1:39:08] if you cannot overcome on your own you
[1:39:13] cannot overcome in public you see
[1:39:16] everybody can overcome when everybody's
[1:39:18] around them making them pump pump them
[1:39:20] up and make them feel good but when
[1:39:23] you're all alone in the past right there
[1:39:24] and y'all going tearing your Deacon a
[1:39:26] tear and the preacher ain't there well I
[1:39:31] you know I was going to do this as a
[1:39:33] song says excuses excuses we hear them
[1:39:36] every day
[1:39:36] excuses excuses you see everybody's got
[1:39:42] excuses for why they didn't do this so
[1:39:44] while they did commit their life to God
[1:39:46] but so did the rich young ruler he had
[1:39:51] his excuses but inhale inhale he lifted
[1:39:55] up his voice I said let father Abraham
[1:39:59] come and dip my tongue with a cold dip
[1:40:03] of water let me go back and testify let
[1:40:07] me go back and testify to my brothers
[1:40:10] and my family there you should have done
[1:40:12] it why you had a chance
[1:40:14] when daddy uses
[1:40:16] that song I'm going to praise the Lord
[1:40:18] while I have a chance but I may not have
[1:40:20] a chance anymore there's a lot of people
[1:40:23] that are wishing that they would have
[1:40:24] served God there's a lot of people that
[1:40:27] wish they would have committed their
[1:40:28] life to God I was praying with a young
[1:40:33] man one time had a spirit of witchcraft
[1:40:39] and the spirit of rebellion on him and I
[1:40:43] watched as the Spirit of the Lord became
[1:40:45] ever so near and begin to discern the
[1:40:49] various secrets of his heart and I
[1:40:52] watched the light of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:54] circled that boy and I watched a window
[1:40:57] of darkness just begin to fade away and
[1:41:00] the light begin to enter in but all of a
[1:41:03] sudden that spirit of witchcraft and
[1:41:06] rebellion closed up that window and he
[1:41:09] shut down his opportunity you see he was
[1:41:14] not willing to commit to his freedom he
[1:41:19] loved living with that spirit and if you
[1:41:23] loved worshiping a sickness there ain't
[1:41:26] no need for me praying for you there
[1:41:31] ain't no need for me giving my all when
[1:41:35] you're not willing to commit yourself
[1:41:37] you see if you're not willing to give it
[1:41:41] all you're going to get half the results
[1:41:43] you see if you put in half the work you
[1:41:45] get half the results and you wonder why
[1:41:48] you're never no further than you are
[1:41:50] today we got a note just this past week
[1:41:53] from a man that's in prison and then
[1:41:56] he's relayed a story about a time that
[1:41:59] he walked to this altar and he said that
[1:42:02] the pastor spoke to him and said now I
[1:42:05] can't do it for you and he said I walked
[1:42:08] away and I didn't get it you see he
[1:42:10] turned down his day of visitation you're
[1:42:14] in prison you can live Rock sure in
[1:42:16] prison you can overcome but when you're
[1:42:18] out and lay out seal are you willing to

[1:42:22] your Hall are you willing to give
[1:42:24] everything come on somebody it's easy to

[1:42:32] when you like when you let go can you
[1:42:34] commit your ways when things ain't good
[1:42:37] can you commit you away when the doctor
[1:42:40] says he got four months or can you
[1:42:41] commit yourself when you know that
[1:42:44] you're going by the way of the grave can
[1:42:46] you still commit yourself this is life
[1:42:53] you cannot just dream yourself into
[1:42:56] character you gotta work you gotta grind
[1:43:00] it out you've got to be willing to stay
[1:43:02] whether you bother you got to be willing
[1:43:04] to sit there and you got to be willing
[1:43:06] to you say you got to be willing to give

[1:43:15] single time whether you hit a stump
[1:43:17] every time and on you keep shooting for
[1:43:19] the stars you keep pressing this battle
[1:43:21] you can say I can do all things through
[1:43:23] Christ who strengthens me you need to
[1:43:26] come down to a spot in your life and you
[1:43:28] say I'm wholly committed to God for this
[1:43:31] is the whole duty of man to commit my
[1:43:34] ways yeah I can dress right when all my
[1:43:39] other sisters are around and the sisters
[1:43:41] are around and they're they're making me
[1:43:43] they're making me they're making me be
[1:43:45] their what they're making me be
[1:43:47] convicted to dress right sure I can do
[1:43:50] it sure I can be committed but can you
[1:43:52] be committed when you're all alone can
[1:43:55] you be committed when there ain't nobody
[1:43:56] when the brothers are around you sure
[1:43:58] you can wear your shorts all around you
[1:44:00] won't - you won't wear them when you're
[1:44:02] around their brothers and sister but

[1:44:31] committed to live right a lot of people
[1:44:37] want supervisor pay
[1:44:38] but they don't want supervisor
[1:44:40] responsibilities a lot of people want
[1:44:43] the ruiers but they don't want the risk
[1:44:46] but you see a moment of pain is worth a
[1:44:49] lifetime of glory when you look at the
[1:44:52] Olympic athletes when they give their
[1:44:54] all when they give their energies when
[1:44:57] they spend years preparing for just a
[1:45:00] short moment of time to stand on a
[1:45:03] podium going for a little-bitty medal
[1:45:06] they'll starve themselves to death they
[1:45:09] need no whoppers and they eat no Big
[1:45:10] Macs
[1:45:11] norther are they eat enough healthy
[1:45:13] fries that you can get now these are not
[1:45:17] dipped in this certain kind of oil
[1:45:21] these are dipped and avocado hard you
[1:45:23] can have these and these are better for
[1:45:26] you they need no french fries they are
[1:45:31] starving themselves for one purpose to
[1:45:36] get on a podium for three minutes and
[1:45:40] stand there America America they stand
[1:45:53] there for three minutes waiting they
[1:45:56] spend the whole life waiting for these
[1:45:58] three moments where everybody can clap
[1:46:00] at them and he'll go hang that medal up
[1:46:03] they have spent their lifetime in pain
[1:46:07] they spent their lifetime getting ready
[1:46:09] and preparing for just a little bit of
[1:46:14] glory but God God is not offering you a
[1:46:20] lifetime of glory he's offering you an
[1:46:23] eternity of glory God is asking for
[1:46:26] first place God is asking for your
[1:46:29] priorities God is asking for your whole
[1:46:31] heart God is asking for total commitment
[1:46:34] hallelujah if you could ever get out of
[1:46:36] the rut of a spiritual laziness where
[1:46:39] you don't give your all but you can get
[1:46:42] out and say hey I was born to give it
[1:46:44] all I was born to overcome I was
[1:46:47] born to be committed I was born to take
[1:46:49] a rapture that's the branch commitment
[1:46:53] is to stay true in the moments of a
[1:46:56] pandemic the Bible says in Psalms 119
[1:47:00] and 2 blessed are they that keep his
[1:47:03] testimonies and that seek him with the
[1:47:06] whole heart Jeremiah 29 and 13 and ye
[1:47:11] shall seek me and find me when ye shall
[1:47:14] search for me with all your heart he
[1:47:21] don't want your mind he don't want your
[1:47:24] strength he don't even want all of your
[1:47:27] energies he wants your heart because if
[1:47:31] he's got your heart
[1:47:33] he's got your energies if he's got your
[1:47:36] heart he's got your mind if he's got
[1:47:38] your heart he's got your strength if he
[1:47:40] can only get your heart today brothers
[1:47:42] and sisters oh if he can only get on the
[1:47:45] inside of the inside I'm not just
[1:47:47] talking on the flesh realm and not just
[1:47:49] talking in your spirit I'm talking on
[1:47:52] the inside of your soul if he could get
[1:47:54] your heart he's got a human being
[1:47:57] whether come here or come high water
[1:47:59] they're committed they can walk through
[1:48:02] hell knowing that they're committed
[1:48:04] because they gave their whole heart to
[1:48:07] God the burn of my her brother burns say
[1:48:12] it this week in a prisoner he says
[1:48:14] sometimes I believe one of the greatest
[1:48:15] things that I found in this day is the
[1:48:18] lack of sincerity of what we believe he
[1:48:21] didn't say what all our works all our
[1:48:25] efforts but in what we believe if God in
[1:48:29] the days of John Wesley would have done
[1:48:30] in that day what he has done today what
[1:48:33] would it have done in the days of Martin
[1:48:35] Luther oh what more as what we see him
[1:48:37] doing both proven by the church or by
[1:48:39] the spirit and by science and every move
[1:48:41] it's emotion has to recognize and God's
[1:48:44] Word here declaring it and telling it
[1:48:46] before it comes to pass and then moving
[1:48:49] on and prophesy and showing the very
[1:48:51] thing that he said he'll come to pass
[1:48:53] perfectly exactly what he said
[1:48:57] and still we sit kind of slothful as if
[1:49:02] we wonder or wondering if that could
[1:49:05] mean me wondering if it could mean just
[1:49:08] the church in the whole or wonder if I'm
[1:49:11] really included in this we sit there
[1:49:15] with a lack of sincerity of what we
[1:49:18] believe and there's going to be people I
[1:49:19] don't see everybody here today because I
[1:49:21] don't see where your listeners this at
[1:49:22] but there's gonna be people to listen to
[1:49:24] this today and say hey you wasn't
[1:49:25] talking about me he was talking about
[1:49:26] her you see they got that pitchfork of
[1:49:28] religion they just pitch it right on
[1:49:30] over he's not talking about me I'm
[1:49:33] committed oh yeah you're just talented
[1:49:37] talented and pitching it over on the
[1:49:39] neighbor but the Bible says in Romans 12
[1:49:42] and 11 not slothful in business fervent
[1:49:44] in spirit serving the Lord rejoicing in
[1:49:47] Hope patient in tribulation continuing
[1:49:49] on instant in prayer let me give it to
[1:49:52] you in the plant in the pass in
[1:49:53] translation be enthusiastic to serve the
[1:49:56] Lord
[1:49:56] keeping your passion toward him bowling
[1:49:59] heart radiate with the glow of the Holy
[1:50:01] Spirit and let him fill you with the
[1:50:03] excitement as you serve him you see
[1:50:06] nothing is ever achieved unless you've
[1:50:11] got enthusiasm
[1:50:12] you won't go to work and really work to
[1:50:16] your full capacity if you don't like
[1:50:18] your job you see the reason why I have
[1:50:22] been successful in business is because I
[1:50:25] like what I do you see the reason why
[1:50:28] you see souls being saved for the
[1:50:30] ministry or brother Ron Spencer is
[1:50:31] because he loves what he does there have
[1:50:35] been thousands of people that have told
[1:50:37] brother on you need to slow down you
[1:50:39] know you really need to slow down but I
[1:50:41] still want you to come to my June
[1:50:42] meeting I still want you to come in July
[1:50:45] still once you come in August and
[1:50:48] brother on through all of these
[1:50:50] treatments all of this battle all this
[1:50:53] cancer what do you think he's doing you
[1:50:55] think he's just laying around on the
[1:50:57] couch eating eating Cheetos and having
[1:50:59] himself a mountain Dew he's digging in
[1:51:02] he's eating this word and we as a people
[1:51:06] are coming
[1:51:07] to pray for him that maybe next weekend
[1:51:10] maybe the weekend after that maybe the
[1:51:12] next month after that he'll be in this
[1:51:14] pulpit preaching us again he's not just
[1:51:17] laying around he's studying the Word of
[1:51:19] God with everything that's within him
[1:51:21] because he realizes the power of this
[1:51:23] word will with the devil anytime
[1:51:25] anyplace under any circumstance
[1:51:28] he's enthused about it why would you
[1:51:34] preach something like this brother
[1:51:35] Andrew it is a challenge to believe it
[1:51:39] is a challenge to rise higher sure there
[1:51:43] sings in every single one of our lives
[1:51:44] even in the preacher's life there's
[1:51:47] things that he could commit more to God
[1:51:52] biggest thing that the bride maybe I
[1:51:56] shouldn't say the bride but the biggest
[1:51:58] thing that people deal with today is
[1:52:00] that little thing they carry in their
[1:52:01] pocket it ain't necessarily little thing
[1:52:05] they carry in the pocket
[1:52:06] ain't necessarily things they look at on
[1:52:09] fox news but it's a four-letter word
[1:52:13] they're committed more to reading what
[1:52:17] trump says what Biden does what this one
[1:52:21] does or what the hell one does more than
[1:52:24] what God says you can read Fox News
[1:52:29] tomorrow morning and it's going to tell
[1:52:31] you maybe a stat of fifty three fifty
[1:52:34] four thousand people have died in
[1:52:35] America because of this but can I give
[1:52:38] you a stat from the Bible that we
[1:52:43] overcame him by the blood of the lamb in
[1:52:46] the word of our testimony that we love
[1:52:48] not our lives unto the death that there
[1:52:51] is a people that no weapon that is
[1:52:53] formed begins them shall prosper Oh
[1:52:55] hallelujah there's a people that is
[1:52:57] greater that is he that is in them than
[1:53:00] he that is in the world there's a people
[1:53:02] that's the stats that I'm pointing
[1:53:04] through this morning people that's
[1:53:08] committed to God not just when they got
[1:53:13] friends around them not just when they
[1:53:14] got to Pastor round you say well oh I
[1:53:16] just ain't got to around me to rally me
[1:53:18] up brother Andrew
[1:53:19] let me ask you something let me point
[1:53:22] out some characters to you look at
[1:53:24] Daniel and the three Hebrew children
[1:53:26] they were the only four that we have
[1:53:28] record Hough throughout the Babylonian
[1:53:31] captivity that remained committed and
[1:53:34] they read they remain committed and did
[1:53:36] not cave in to the brainwashing of the
[1:53:40] Babylonian people but they stayed
[1:53:42] committed through captivity to the one
[1:53:46] true God and the Bible said that Daniel
[1:53:49] purposed in his heart not to defile
[1:53:52] himself with the king's drink he didn't
[1:53:55] have nobody else around him but he
[1:53:58] purposed in his heart that I will not
[1:54:04] defile myself with the things of
[1:54:06] Laodicea
[1:54:07] you see we make our decisions and our
[1:54:11] decisions turn around and make us
[1:54:16] whether good or bad we make our
[1:54:19] decisions and her decisions turn around
[1:54:20] and make us you see a choice in time
[1:54:23] yields a destiny in eternity just like
[1:54:28] when Ruth was standing there with Naomi
[1:54:30] and Orpah sin drew said where you go I
[1:54:33] will go your where you large I would
[1:54:36] Hajj your people my people your God my
[1:54:39] God where you die I will die
[1:54:41] she wise committed not to turn back not
[1:54:47] to turn back to Moab and the things of
[1:54:49] the world but to press the battle that
[1:54:51] was in front of her
[1:54:53] well the bantam said that I'm so glad
[1:54:55] that a man can so completely serve God
[1:54:57] to the devil don't know what to do with
[1:54:59] that's a committed Christian a man could
[1:55:03] so completely serve God to the devil
[1:55:06] don't know what to do what to do with
[1:55:08] I'd say that the Apostle Paul was that
[1:55:10] kind of a man when he would say in first
[1:55:13] Corinthians 2 and 2 for I determined not
[1:55:15] to know anything among you save Jesus
[1:55:17] Christ and him crucified here's a man
[1:55:20] that knew the letter better than anybody
[1:55:22] else but he determined not to know
[1:55:23] anything but the Lord Jesus Christ can
[1:55:27] look at Paul to see all that he went
[1:55:29] through
[1:55:30] of him murdering the Christians a the
[1:55:33] persecution of the church and his
[1:55:34] experience on the road to Damascus but
[1:55:37] the homra would always say that the
[1:55:39] devil Menace max when he met Paul
[1:55:41] because Paul was not a coward
[1:55:43] Paul was persuaded that neither death
[1:55:45] nor life nor things present nor things
[1:55:48] come would be able to separate him from
[1:55:50] the love of God Paul was not a coward
[1:55:53] Paul was committed and the biggest
[1:55:57] trouble with people today in the church
[1:55:58] today is a bunch of fear they're always
[1:56:00] scared they're scared of the devil
[1:56:02] mother banner said don't be scared be
[1:56:04] brave you don't have nothing to be
[1:56:06] afraid of about it was so committed Paul
[1:56:10] was so committed that he stood there in
[1:56:13] Acts chapter 28 when it had to prison
[1:56:17] guard standing around him he said Here I
[1:56:20] am bound with this chain he was so
[1:56:24] committed in a dungeon that there were
[1:56:27] guards that wanted to be assigned to his
[1:56:30] detail as Paul was sitting there in a
[1:56:32] dungeon and rats running around snakes
[1:56:35] running around different things going
[1:56:36] around those days and pause they were
[1:56:39] not blessing
[1:56:41] most days imposed they were not perfect
[1:56:45] but Paul remained committed to the cause
[1:56:49] of Jesus Christ because he had one thing
[1:56:53] an experience and when Paul was standing
[1:56:58] there in 2nd Corinthians 11 and 24 and
[1:57:01] Paul is proving his vindication of being
[1:57:05] a prisoner of Christ against and he's
[1:57:07] proven to the false anointed ones that
[1:57:10] he was committed to all that he went
[1:57:12] through 2nd Corinthians 11 and 24 but
[1:57:17] I've been through some things with
[1:57:18] Andrew you just don't understand of the
[1:57:21] Jews five times received I forty stripes
[1:57:23] save one price was i beaten with rods
[1:57:27] once was i stolen fries suffered
[1:57:29] shipwreck a night in the day I've been
[1:57:31] in a deep in journeyings often in perils
[1:57:34] of waters and perils of robbers in
[1:57:36] perils by my own countrymen in perils by
[1:57:38] heathen in perils in the city in perils
[1:57:41] in the wilderness in perils in the sea
[1:57:43] perils among false brethren in weariness
[1:57:46] and painfulness in watchings often in
[1:57:48] hunger and thirst in fastings often in
[1:57:51] cold nakedness beside those things which
[1:57:56] are without that which cometh upon me
[1:57:58] daily the day the care of all the
[1:58:00] churches who is weak and I am NOT weak
[1:58:02] who is offended and I'm banned I burn
[1:58:04] not if I must needs go hurry I will
[1:58:07] Gloria the things which concern my
[1:58:09] infirmities the God and the Father of
[1:58:12] our Lord Jesus Christ which is blessed
[1:58:13] forever more noise
[1:58:15] then I'll are not Colossians 3 and 23
[1:58:20] whatsoever you do do it heartily as to
[1:58:24] the Lord and not in the men knowing that
[1:58:27] knowing that of the Lord you shall
[1:58:29] receive the reward of the inheritance
[1:58:32] for you serve the Lord Christ the bride
[1:58:39] isn't just serving him because of a
[1:58:42] status she's committed to him she's
[1:58:47] committed to him when it looks like the
[1:58:51] wagon will never come down the road when
[1:58:54] it looks like the baby ain't come and
[1:58:56] Abraham and Sarah were still committed
[1:58:58] when it looked like the promise was
[1:59:01] being taken away and Jobe would still
[1:59:04] say that though God slay me yet I will
[1:59:08] trust him Joseph when he was in a
[1:59:11] dungeon he still was committed when he
[1:59:14] was tempted when he was tempted by
[1:59:16] Potiphar's wife he was still committed
[1:59:19] there was no brother's around him but he
[1:59:22] was committed I heard a story about a
[1:59:29] blind woman from Canada that one golf
[1:59:33] tournaments all over the US and all over
[1:59:36] Canada a blind woman
[1:59:41] the only thing her husband would travel
[1:59:45] with her and he would line her up in the
[1:59:48] direction that she needed to hit the
[1:59:50] ball
[1:59:50] she won tournaments all over
[1:59:54] the pros would come and they'd watch
[1:59:55] this lady they'd watch her as she would
[1:59:59] as she would swing and they watched her
[2:00:01] stroke how that it was perfect they said
[2:00:05] well I couldn't do anything like that
[2:00:07] she did not allow her limitations to
[2:00:10] hold her back you look at men you look
[2:00:15] at men that play the piano that are
[2:00:17] blind that although they did they
[2:00:19] started to do they sit down at the piano
[2:00:21] and they started to play and they asked
[2:00:25] that God would anoint him they were
[2:00:27] blind you look at Fanny Crosby when you
[2:00:31] look at her which she was so enormous to
[2:00:34] write some of the most anointed and
[2:00:36] powerful songs of the Christian of the
[2:00:39] Christian realm but she would not sell
[2:00:42] out because she was committed to him she
[2:00:49] could had money she could have had Fame
[2:00:50] and they mocked her and they scorned her
[2:00:53] and she wrote the song that I will know
[2:00:57] him I will know him how will you know
[2:01:01] him by any crosby I will know him by the
[2:01:04] nail prints in his hands she was
[2:01:06] committed to lay it all on the line you
[2:01:10] look at Beethoven when he got to a spot
[2:01:13] in his life he could no longer he could
[2:01:17] no longer perform in his way he did not
[2:01:20] allow his limitations to stop him he was
[2:01:24] committed to his talent he chopped the
[2:01:27] legs off of his piano and he learned how
[2:01:31] to play by vibrations he did not allow
[2:01:34] his limitations to hold him back look at
[2:01:37] Clinton Cunningham he was burned in a
[2:01:40] fire as a young boy as a school as a
[2:01:42] school fire and they told him that he
[2:01:44] would die and he didn't and he made it
[2:01:47] through they told him that he never
[2:01:48] walked again that he would be committed
[2:01:50] to that wheelchair for the rest of his
[2:01:52] life and that day after day he would go
[2:01:55] out and throw himself out of that
[2:01:57] wheelchair pull himself by the picots of
[2:02:00] a fence build strength dragging his feet
[2:02:03] dragging his legs
[2:02:05] and his legs all to pieces I said I will
[2:02:09] not be bound to a wheelchair and he
[2:02:12] finally reestablish held a walk and then
[2:02:15] he started running and he was the first
[2:02:18] man to ever run a four-minute mile a man
[2:02:23] that said that he would never walk he
[2:02:26] did not allow his limitations to hold
[2:02:29] him back brother Branham said that if
[2:02:31] you can eliminate God you limit Christ
[2:02:33] and if you limit the church today in its
[2:02:35] possibilities you're limiting God but
[2:02:37] all things whatsoever you desire when
[2:02:39] you pray believe and usually receive
[2:02:42] them and you shall have them these
[2:02:46] people did this in a naturally realm but
[2:02:52] a what about you little bride what about
[2:02:55] you and your own spiritual determination
[2:02:58] will you go further will you press the
[2:03:01] battle that's what the voice said to
[2:03:06] brother Branham when he was coming back
[2:03:09] from beyond the curtain of time press
[2:03:13] the battle press the battle press the
[2:03:17] battle let's say if homer Fraser Steve
[2:03:20] Thomas big brother Mickelson they holler
[2:03:24] out to us press the battle stay
[2:03:27] committed stay in line stay in line
[2:03:31] little brah get back in line little
[2:03:33] bride Oh hallelujah you watched my
[2:03:38] little wife this morning get up and sing
[2:03:42] so embarrassed to stand in front of
[2:03:45] people so shocked so so even shook up
[2:03:50] their even stand in front of people but
[2:03:52] because of her commitment to serve God
[2:03:55] she wanted to put what God wanted first
[2:03:59] what if we would give 100% of our self
[2:04:06] what are the things that you've been
[2:04:08] holding back all of your life what if
[2:04:12] you would have the determination like a
[2:04:14] little Mexican woman they had a little
[2:04:16] bit baby
[2:04:17] that died with pneumonia and nine
[2:04:20] o'clock in the morning but she heard
[2:04:23] that there was a healer in the land and
[2:04:25] there was 300 Usher's that would not
[2:04:27] stop her that could not stop her and
[2:04:30] Billy came and said daddy there's a
[2:04:32] little woman back there that's trying to
[2:04:34] get to you that we can't stop Oh
[2:04:37] hallelujah
[2:04:39] and her determination allowed her to
[2:04:42] push through her circumstance push past
[2:04:45] strength of man to get to where brother
[2:04:49] Randall was what if you would push past
[2:04:52] your fears I know I ain't got you
[2:04:57] screaming at me today but I want you to
[2:04:59] scream it on that side of the telephone
[2:05:01] and that side of the internet why are
[2:05:03] you holding back what are you willing to
[2:05:05] give wait what if you gave all brother
[2:05:09] Branham said what type of people should
[2:05:11] we be today we're not asking for you to
[2:05:15] tell us what you're going to do but show
[2:05:17] us what you're going to do brother BAM
[2:05:20] said live me a sermon don't preach me
[2:05:22] sir the people will receive it hold on
[2:05:26] more well I got a headache I can't come
[2:05:33] to church wake ain't nobody come to
[2:05:34] church right now except for the few
[2:05:39] chosen but thank God we're not the
[2:05:40] frozen Chosin but when I kicked coming
[2:05:46] back to church I'm over you know this is
[2:05:50] one thing I've wondered you know
[2:05:54] normally when the song leader gets done
[2:05:57] and the preacher starts to take his
[2:06:00] position there's a halftime I wonder how
[2:06:04] many of you have had to go use a
[2:06:06] restroom while you've been sitting in
[2:06:08] your lazy boy but you'll come back to
[2:06:11] church and about 35 to 45 minutes in and
[2:06:15] you'll go running back to the bathroom
[2:06:17] because a little Johnny or a little Suzy
[2:06:19] says you know what I just gotta go but
[2:06:21] are you committed in your own house
[2:06:24] they're doing the same thing that you
[2:06:25] did in church I want to see it when you
[2:06:27] come
[2:06:28] praise God well I'm not gonna come to
[2:06:31] church because I got a headache and I've
[2:06:33] got I've got all kinds of circumstances
[2:06:34] and and you know I just I just been
[2:06:37] feeling really blue this is the best
[2:06:39] place that you could be in when you're
[2:06:41] feeling down whether you're feeling up
[2:06:43] whether you're feeling down
[2:06:44] granddaddy look at him had his leg cut

[2:06:55] medicine during service but still wanted
[2:06:57] to say it man still wanted to preach I'd
[2:07:02] say that we have had leaders in front of
[2:07:05] us for gospel lighthouse to challenge us
[2:07:07] to rise to the challenge to be committed
[2:07:11] to God with everything that is within us
[2:07:13] every time I walk out of that back
[2:07:15] office back there I say God I commit my
[2:07:17] all of my fibers my beings if you want
[2:07:20] to make me drunk in a spirit make me
[2:07:22] slobber all over this place make me
[2:07:24] dance make me shout do whatever I admit
[2:07:27] myself

[2:09:34] be a preacher but you got a voice and if
[2:09:37] you can't preach the people a sermon if
[2:09:39] you're a preacher you're called to the
[2:09:41] pulpit to preach if you're not you're
[2:09:43] still a preacher oh I wanted to position
[2:09:46] it ain't about the position it's about
[2:09:49] living it
[2:09:51] you're still a preacher but live the
[2:09:54] people sermon let your sermon be lived
[2:09:57] and it's the voice of God that'll bring
[2:10:00] reproach to them who rejected they say
[2:10:02] no one can put a finger on his life or
[2:10:05] her life their sweet living if there
[2:10:07] ever was a man of God it's a man or a
[2:10:10] woman see live your sermons don't try to
[2:10:12] preach them if you're not called to be a
[2:10:14] preacher you'll get all mixed up anyhow
[2:10:16] and mess up and you'll get people
[2:10:18] tangled up or you'll ruin them and
[2:10:20] you'll ruin yourself to just live your
[2:10:24] sermon the preachers called to preach
[2:10:27] this and deliver to and if you can't
[2:10:31] live it then you stop preaching it but
[2:10:33] you're supposed to live your sermons
[2:10:35] alright how we need
[2:10:39] in Jeffersonville thousands of live
[2:10:42] voices the thunder of God thundering out
[2:10:44] in sweetness and in holiness purity
[2:10:46] undefiled laughs walking around in the
[2:10:49] earth today without a blemish yes sir
[2:10:51] that's the thunder against the enemy now
[2:10:55] that's Satan's worst nightmare the
[2:11:00] thunder against the enemy the devil
[2:11:02] don't care how loud you holler the devil
[2:11:04] don't care how much you can jump or how
[2:11:06] much you can do this or shout but what
[2:11:08] hurts the devil are you ready it ain't
[2:11:13] what makes ain't you shall make make are
[2:11:15] you talking in tongues ain't you jumping
[2:11:17] up and down screaming but weren't hurts
[2:11:20] the devil is to see that sanctified Holy
[2:11:24] life consecrated to God say anything to
[2:11:29] him call him anything just as sweet as
[2:11:33] it can be and move right on now I say
[2:11:40] because there are some times there's an
[2:11:43] old man that wants to come rising up
[2:11:45] when somebody says something about my
[2:11:46] dad who said something but my wife says
[2:11:48] something about my children there's a
[2:11:49] man on the inside wants to raise up but
[2:11:53] then the Holy Ghost says shut up shut up
[2:11:56] Andrew he st. your time to speak walk on
[2:12:01] that's what scares the devil is to see
[2:12:07] that holy life consecrated to God say
[2:12:11] anything to him call him anything just
[2:12:15] as sweet as he can be and move right on
[2:12:17] threat that froze him away that's the
[2:12:20] Sun Thunder that shakes the devil now I
[2:12:23] could read you the I could read you the
[2:12:25] quote - that you brother BAM said you
[2:12:26] could try to be so humble and oh you got
[2:12:29] us a wishbone and the devil beat you
[2:12:32] every which way around but there are
[2:12:34] spots in your life you need to humble
[2:12:37] yourself down live a real sweet holy
[2:12:41] consecrated life now I know I'm not
[2:12:45] alone cuz I know the kind of people they
[2:12:48] setting this church
[2:12:51] sure we want to rise up but why don't we
[2:12:54] let God arise why don't we let God speak
[2:12:58] instead of putting forth our mouth and
[2:13:01] our sense and our thoughts let's let him
[2:13:04] speak let's let God speak let's like
[2:13:07] blood live when I'm trying to live right
[2:13:09] I'm trying to do this I'm trying to
[2:13:10] commit my ways
[2:13:11] just uh just this message came to
[2:13:16] produce live voices not a mechanical
[2:13:20] tape the jeffersonville wants to produce
[2:13:23] today I think it's amazing it brother
[2:13:26] Ron brother Branham would say oh how we
[2:13:28] need today in Jefferson vo thousands of
[2:13:31] live voices he didn't say we need tape
[2:13:33] players he says we need to live voices
[2:13:36] people that'll live this message the
[2:13:38] devil ain't scared of your tape player
[2:13:39] because your tape player can be employed
[2:13:41] but you can't be unplucked because you
[2:13:43] are plugged in you're plugged in to the
[2:13:47] source of power and yeah the enemy can
[2:13:50] make you sick but yet there's still a
[2:13:52] power on the inside of you that's
[2:13:54] greater than a tape player greater than
[2:13:56] a CD it's the power of Almighty God Paul
[2:14:04] said I am persuaded I am committed as I
[2:14:09] finish with this alts and the musicians
[2:14:11] come
[2:14:12] may you be able to say these things that
[2:14:14] I have committed no matter the sickness
[2:14:16] no matter the enemy no matter the
[2:14:19] punches I take no matter the troubles I
[2:14:22] see no matter the doctors report no
[2:14:24] matter the test results no matter what
[2:14:26] the critics say no matter what they say
[2:14:28] no matter what the agnostics say no
[2:14:30] matter what the unbelievers say no
[2:14:32] matter how I feel no matter what comes
[2:14:34] no matter what goes no matter who stands
[2:14:36] with me and who doesn't stand with me
[2:14:38] quitting is not an option turning around
[2:14:41] is not an option
[2:14:43] recanting is not an option and giving up
[2:14:46] is not an option you're his elect you're
[2:14:50] his chosen your placed here at Satan's
[2:14:53] Eden to be committed to overcome to be
[2:14:56] victorious not to be overrun by your own
[2:14:59] self
[2:15:02] to be filled of him and to keep your
[2:15:06] eyes on him we must work while it is day
[2:15:10] for night cometh when the hour when no
[2:15:13] man can come as Jesus said I must be
[2:15:18] about my father's business a
[2:15:19] twelve-year-old boy a twelve-year-old
[2:15:23] boy that had not received the baptism of
[2:15:25] the Holy Ghost at the time but twelve
[2:15:27] years old said I must be about my
[2:15:29] father's business
[2:15:30] may we be committed how much more having
[2:15:35] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:15:37] to stand in the face of opposition in
[2:15:40] the face of the enemy said I am
[2:15:43] committed to the cause of Jesus Christ
[2:15:47] his pledge is his word he's obligated to
[2:15:51] you to take care of you but will you
[2:15:54] take care of him will you take care will
[2:15:58] you give your all housewife's you think

[2:16:03] more I'm watching - this is all I can
[2:16:05] take care of the hamper I'm taking care
[2:16:07] of the laundry I'm taking care of this
[2:16:10] be committed to stay in this message
[2:16:13] this is where rapturing faith is it's
[2:16:17] right here in this message right here in
[2:16:22] this message right here in this message
[2:16:27] one less salt mother Brennan said be
[2:16:31] determined don't be defeated you can't
[2:16:35] be defeated you're children of God I
[2:16:40] know sometimes as mamas and daddies you
[2:16:44] get disturbed by what goes on in your
[2:16:46] household but don't let that shake you
[2:16:50] and your faith stay committed I know
[2:16:55] sometimes you you want the promise to
[2:16:58] come to pass sooner than what it is but
[2:17:01] he's the one that is committed and
[2:17:03] bringing it to pass god only requires
[2:17:06] for you to do your part I stay committed
[2:17:10] whether you see it whether you're doing
[2:17:13] to stay focused on the promise that God
[2:17:16] they said ah and accepting that
[2:17:19] obligation love you now I saw her I want
[2:17:26] to see the miracle I want to see the
[2:17:29] miracle but God is under obligation to
[2:17:33] his own word not to my feelings
[2:17:36] not to my emotions but he's obligated to
[2:17:39] his word and if I and the as you could
[2:17:44] ever realize that you've taken your veil
[2:17:47] and you've placed it over on him now if
[2:17:53] you take it off of him you're showing
[2:17:56] that you are not committed to him and
[2:17:58] he's not committed to you but just leave
[2:18:02] it the hair on his shoulder you see the
[2:18:06] Bible says Jesus said that by the finger
[2:18:09] the enemy is kicked out notice he can
[2:18:14] kick the enemy out with his finger but
[2:18:18] when it comes to carrying out of sheep
[2:18:21] he places him upon his shoulder upon the
[2:18:26] strongest part of the man's body
[2:18:28] where all of his strength is being shown
[2:18:30] that's where he's caring in you and all
[2:18:34] of his words that he's had to you let's
[2:18:37] bow our hearts this mornin Heavenly
[2:18:40] Father we come before your throne of
[2:18:43] grace lord I did not choose to preach
[2:18:50] this sermon because of people are
[2:18:53] uncommitted
[2:18:55] or anything that they even see but
[2:18:58] because I felt a push of the Holy Ghost
[2:19:00] to speak these things
[2:19:03] this is not a time to rely upon our
[2:19:06] talents and be reluctant be
[2:19:09] procrastinators but it is a time
[2:19:13] you're calling for a true committal be
[2:19:17] gone
[2:19:19] may we just leave this harvested day
[2:19:22] with this song
[2:19:24] that the greatest one of the greatest
[2:19:26] weapons it's placed in a man is a
[2:19:29] community garden if I only would have
[2:19:33] said those few words right there
[2:19:36] I believe the sermon was entitled was
[2:19:39] completely set out in those words father
[2:19:43] you heard the much speaking that was
[2:19:45] done today
[2:19:47] father you see or every word that was
[2:19:51] spoken maybe one for a year one for them
[2:19:53] or even one for myself God may we be
[2:19:59] challenged to stay true to this gospel
[2:20:03] surely this message throw to you well we
[2:20:08] don't see the promise coming in due time
[2:20:10] on which we want maybe not take her veil
[2:20:12] off of your souls
[2:20:15] or there's a whole lot of towns going
[2:20:18] which is one a ton we just want the
[2:20:21] nightmare we just want the dream or we
[2:20:23] just want the thing to stop coming
[2:20:26] but you have allowed these things to
[2:20:28] happen for preparedness in a heart
[2:20:33] to me because of the coronavirus it has
[2:20:38] not made me study more it's not
[2:20:40] necessarily made me pray more but I'm
[2:20:42] sure there is some that have prayed more
[2:20:44] they've had more time to pray he had
[2:20:45] more time to study lord I will say it
[2:20:51] has made me aware that you are very near
[2:20:54] to see the warfare of germs to see the
[2:20:58] things that your prophet is said Lord
[2:21:02] our hearts are stirred Lord we want to
[2:21:08] be accounted worthy to escape the things
[2:21:11] that article
[2:21:13] Oh God I can't go around make choices
[2:21:18] for people or even I can't make people
[2:21:22] Brian I can't even make my own self
[2:21:24] pride but I can't choose you as my
[2:21:27] savior
[2:21:27] that's my dealer is my wave maker is my
[2:21:29] promise keeper I choose you
[2:21:32] but I certainly feel on the inside of my
[2:21:35] heart that you have called me abroad by
[2:21:38] the phase that I've heard the mighty
[2:21:39] angel disperse to us Lord Jesus
[2:21:44] may we be committed to eat not just half
[2:21:48] of the book by the hope even the parts
[2:21:53] and terrors from lending limit scenes
[2:21:54] may we eat it may we swallow it may we
[2:21:59] double chiton let it go down sure it's
[2:22:02] gonna cause war in our belly but may it
[2:22:07] produce film that prophesy again

[2:22:16] Gospel icons fulfill our purpose or our
[2:22:20] portions we've seen the mighty angel
[2:22:22] standing we've seen the mysteries of God
[2:22:25] revealed by revelations since 7 may we
[2:22:28] fulfill our purpose or our force in the
[2:22:30] revelations 10 8 through 11 may we
[2:22:33] prophesy again may we be committed to
[2:22:36] the call the Lord these words are true

[2:22:45] committed my life to God maybe they're
[2:22:49] setting in their homes people are
[2:22:51] committing their lives to you repenting
[2:22:53] of things they've done wrong or said
[2:22:55] wrong or maybe even would ask if it'd be
[2:23:00] a way that I can lay my hands on they
[2:23:03] don't meet my hand
[2:23:05] they just need you to lay your hands
[2:23:07] upon I pray that you'd instruct them in
[2:23:11] the way that they should go teach them

[2:23:16] all gifts may we not turn down the
[2:23:20] opportunities that we've been given may
