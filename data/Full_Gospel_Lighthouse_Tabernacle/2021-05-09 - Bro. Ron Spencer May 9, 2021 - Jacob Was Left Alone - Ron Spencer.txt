mother's day to each and every one of you to my beautiful wife this morning and we certainly wish her happy mother's day and uh sister nancy amend the queen mother here so we love you each and every one of you amen god bless you this morning amen i'm so thrilled to be with you and so honored to be able to stand here this morning and say hello to you again and we never take none of these things for granted amen i got a couple of notes this week if it's okay if i'll share these with you one came from canada and i thought it was just really good it must have been right from the angel's hands he said i was thinking of thinking and praying for you this morning my friend he said we we pray for you often he says i was just thinking of that poor little old demon that gets sent to fight with you every day every morning he whines to his demon friends over breakfast about being assigned to you why couldn't he just get someone easy like the president or somebody he trudges to work knowing full well there's a whipping in store for him today he takes his licks all day and after failing at every task he puts his hands to he's tired very tired then it's time to report to into the boss and he tries to explain once again why he's got nothing to show for his day's work this doesn't go over well at all to say the least satan is surprised that a demon with such a successful track record before is now become so ineffective he's told to snap out of it and he is going back tomorrow and the next day and the day after that until something is to show for his work he asked for reinforcements knowing that inside it's not going to help god always raises a standard against whatever forces that he brings this target is protected every wound that he's been able to make had to be pre-authorized by god that means that any progress that he makes has to be approved by his enemy it doesn't take a general to see that he's losing this battle he licks his wounds crawls into bed knowing tomorrow it's going to be the very same way it kind of makes you feel sorry for this dumb devil but he's the one that chose this work to do he said have a great day i got this one from switzerland this morning he said there aren't so many things in the bible on which a huge amount of glory is bound to it but the trial of your faith and he says and i'm jealous over your beautiful crown god has prepared for you amen came at a good day started out with my sugar about 600 this morning and i thought about these things and i thought i'll just read them i'm just going to go ahead and read them and say boo devil so amen amen god bless you this morning we so love you with all of our hearts and i know that today is going to be a great day last night was a great night so good to see so many of your smiling faces amen i'd like to just speak with you this this morning on jacob was left alone amen genesis chapter 32 and verse 24. if you'll turn there with me it's a wonderful story and that actually describes much of your life amen we're just so glad to see you say hello to so many people and we love you with all of our hearts and amen amen god bless you god bless you everywhere you're at and bring you greetings in the name of the lord jesus christ i just can't wait i hear that song about jerusalem and us all coming back together i can't wait to walk down the streets with you guys and hey amen what a day that's going to be and it's just just a few more moments we're going to get there amen it's not a meal we're going to get there amen amen genesis 32 and verse 24 and jacob was left alone how many has ever been left alone [Music] and there wrastled a man with him until the break-in of the day and when he saw that he would prevail not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacob's thigh was put out of joint and he wrestled with him now just because he's now the angel has inflicted an incredible scar that will rest the rest of his life he didn't he didn't let go and the angel said and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince has thou power with god and with men and has prevailed and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore it is that thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him there and jacob called the place pinell for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved amen let's talk to him now lord jesus we love you with all of our hearts tonight we thank you for this wonderful mother's day and lord all the wonderful things that it blesses us with our wives our our daughters our daughter-in-laws lord the family of this church i pray that you would bless those even around the world even now there's so many afflictions that is going on lord we ask you that you these things that we have been praying about we ask you that you'd send your word and heal them father lord lord grant us a special touch from you today in jesus christ's name we pray amen and a man and amen and amen god bless you this morning we certainly love you with all of our hearts and soul amen amen i picked up that there was a question about the sugar that's going up and down and i'll just i'll just take care of that real quick it's because that i'm continuing to be on chemo and the chemo has affected either the cancer or the chemo has affected my pancreas and so my pancreas is not working so they're trying to take care of it with medicine and i can go to bed without eating anything it and be at about 120 and and wake up at four to six hundred so it's just a part of the battle but the devil's going to lose and so amen god's going to restore all things amen so that'll just that'll just let you know i'm not eating donuts and candy and all that kind of thing and i'd love to do that again but it's kind of like putting diesel in a gas engine it don't work no more like that so amen i appreciate that that you would send me those kind of things but my kids will eat it amen amen god bless you this morning seems like an interesting subject for us to take jacob of all of the people of the scripture on mother's day but we must remember he was a mama's boy hallelujah he was a mama's boy and you know he had a brother that was named esau that was a daddy's boy daddy's boy would hunt go out and did a lot of things that was very beneficial to the to the local family he was very he was a very fundamental very good guy he was very righteous in his spirit little brother was a shyster he was a brat come he was somebody that probably most of us in this building would not even want to associate with he was a booger there's not enough adjectives to put with it though he come from royal family and have royal future potential inside of him his first nature due to the fall caused him to be a real rascal this man would be an a description of grace he would be an individual to where in the scriptures that god would use him for a specific purpose because god would no doubt in in in any in any form of things it's not how you look sometimes at things in its beginning you see god's got a plan and people that you completely give up on [Applause] people that you completely give up on just hang on just a little while god's not finished writing the book about it [Applause] you and i would have throwed throwed jacob away because you and i didn't understand that before they were even born while they were still wrestling in the womb god said esau i hate him now who did he tell that to his mother and his mother would always think about what god put in her heart maybe not sharing with the world nobody wants to share that god chose one of my children and hates the other one that ain't something that you send out on the internet but god made the choice now i want you to think if god ever thought of you if you were ever an attribute in his mind he will never ever lose you [Applause] are you with me now it's not you holding on it's not you that are going through your wobbles of roller coasters of life and one day is good one day is bad one day is good one day is bad it's not you that thinks well i've got to attain to a certain level it's god put a predestinated seed on the inside of you and there's times where you feel like giving up and you say i quit and god just smiles because you're not holding on brother i'm saying yes i'll let you go through things just to let you know who's the boss [Applause] are you with me now jacob leaves home we know that he's tricked his daddy he's tricked his brother he has now has the blessing he has the birthright he has the blessing and he would trick it out of it out of his own daddy and esau note that he had the right to the blessing and jacob has tricked him tricked his blind daddy now just think about it just for a moment so many times we feel sorry for people in different situations but god had to have isaac blind [Applause] and he staggered in the darkness for maybe even decades blood couldn't see the daylight but had he not been blind he would have never never blessed jacob you with me and remember this jacob was going to be the lineage of israel amen you may not have looked at it and remember their god's chosen people and the scripture says and the god of abraham and the god of isaac but there was a time that jacob hadn't made him his god he had a blessing he had a birthright but yet he hadn't made him his god there comes a time in your life where you've got to wrestle it out and you may be predestinated seed in a season of your life that you were aliens from the commonwealth of god and maybe your parents gave up on you amen [Music] now you know sometimes you get what you ask for and jacob goes to the kindred to get himself a wife and he meets a man named laban laban the first the first one that he met in that land was a girl named rachel she must have been a beautiful woman amen i want you to think about this for a moment because jacob was in a royal family amen and in abraham's household there were a lot of beautiful women sarah was a beautiful woman amen right now rebecca was a beautiful woman so there was probably no doubt a lot of beautiful women that was around and remember he was a rascal amen but when he sees rachel something begins to bounce in his chest it ain't never happened in his life and now this rascal is attached to this woman that he loves don't know exactly how he's going to get her but he's after her now he's on the chase so he meets laban and laban is a whole lot like jacob sometimes you're a lot like your father-in-law and so laban sees his potential that's and sees there's a blessing and a birthright with him he liked to have that in his home and he'd like to keep him around and you know keeping jacob around his flocks groaned he became more rich just having him work in the house having him work in the fields just having him around the stories that were told there was a blessing that was with him amen and he said if you work seven years for the old testament broad i'll give you a new testament brought but you're gonna have to work seven years here for the old testament and you're going to have to work seven years for the new testament [Applause] hallelujah through jacob's sea through his natural lineage god is going to produce the old testament bride through a rascal through a wretched man like paul says all wretched man that i am seven years of work seven years the wedding takes place the ceremony happens he goes to his tent with his wife and he wakes up the next morning with a different girl it is the older system i'd like to read your scripture about her in genesis chapter 29 and verse 31 because she has an important place in the kingdom of god and when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened her womb but rachel was married and leah conceived and bear a son and she called his name reuben for she said surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction the scripture called her tenderize the previous scripture called her tender life even god saw her as an ugly woman amen hey god don't lie [Music] the scripture bears out as much as beautiful as rachel is that's how ugly leah was and the reason i bring this point to you is because no matter how ugly you think you are in your life [Applause] come on church come on church no matter how much that you look at yourself and see the ugliness of your life and how things have went in your life god's still got purpose for you that ought to cause you to shout this morning though even god called her tenderized no though even the moses the prophet looked back and saw how god looked at her but god didn't leave her in that place he opened her womb because out of her six sons six tribes half of the tribes of israel was going to pass through her womb amen amen now what you just think she lives with a man that hates her she lives with a man that disdains her she lives with a man that thinks she's ugly now watch these scriptures and leah conceived and married a son and she called his name reuben for she said surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction and now therefore my husband will love me reuben will become the eldest leader of jerusalem of israel notice the words surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction and now therefore my husband will love me amen and she conceived again and bear a son and she said because the lord hath heard that i was hated he had therefore given me this son and she called his name simeon and she conceived again and bear a son and said now this time will my husband come in union with me join unto me can you read into these scriptures her complex yeah can you read any of these scriptures for complex because i have borne him three sons therefore was his name called levi levi his children would become the servants in the temple are you with me they would become some of the most anointed servants that god would have and it would come through a womb that's right that god productionated all right you're right now i want you to just notice this next and she conceived again and bear a son now notice this there comes a time in your life that you realize i've been placed in the kingdom for such a time as this and she said now i will praise the lord notice now she's not concerned were jacob loves her or not oh i feel like preaching she's not concerned where everybody else loves her or not but i'm going to name this boy judah [Applause] [Music] now i will praise the lord for every scripture that points back to out of the tribe of judah will talk about my womb we'll talk about the seed that passed through my womb i'm a part of the kingdom of god jesus the lineage of jesus is going to pass through my womb come on church so no matter about how bad you're hated no matter how ugly life seems to be through the womb of your soul god has chosen god has chose to place his seed in you i want you to think about this of all of the billions of people on the earth whether it was rahab or tamar or ruth it wasn't their flesh that preserved them help me now don't let your minds go drifting here at this point but listen it wasn't their flesh or their name that preserved them it was the seed in the womb [Applause] it was the royal seed that was placed in the womb whether it was kmart right or whether it was sarah any of these women it was a seed that went into the womb there's been churches churches and bridesbridge there's been women churches of the earth that thought they were so special but because he placed his seed in the womb of your soul that's what makes you renewable glory that's what places you wasn't that you were so special it was he chose something inside of you that makes you special [Applause] jacob is making his way home because somewhere you got to go back to the word the birthright is not to be over there in laban's house it's to be over here and he's got to make a journey with his wives and those boys everything that he's got he's got to go back home now understand listen let me just say this you his brother still looks at him that's right as a rascal amen a traitor a guy that's a stinker that is a disloyal man that will steal everything you got [Applause] his brother is in on a mission they're going to meet somewhere you're going to have to meet the devil toe-to-toe and you better have the goods are you with me you're not going to have your preacher with you you're not going to have the deacons with you you're probably not going to have your family with you you're going to be alone and satan's going to meet you you better know who you are where you came from and where you're going you better know your position in life you're headed for a rapture satan's going to do everything that he can to stop it are you with me you've got to nail down your spot in life you've got to know where you're at you don't need a thousand people around you to prop you up you and god are a majority [Applause] come on church you and god are a majority now jacob had heard about abraham's god he had heard about abraham being met at the tent and he turned them back young again he had heard about the visitation of the angel of melchizedek coming to that tent he had heard about all of the other stories that was supernatural since the garden of eden that's what jacob needed let me just repeat to you that's what you need it don't matter what your name is who you're associated with what you need is not shaking a preacher's hand putting your name on a book somewhere another getting a religious experience getting an intellectual conception you need to meet jesus the very angel of god you need to meet him generally it comes in desperate times it generally comes in trouble sometimes generally comes when your life is against the wall you know you'll do your best fighting when you know you're getting ready to die when you're getting ready to die don't matter how much money money's in your bank [Applause] when you're getting ready to die it don't matter how much is in your ira account it don't matter what kind of car you drive or house you live in or what kind of job you got when you're getting ready to die you want to make sure everything's right when you come down to the jordan come on you ain't gonna put on and blow yourself up and make yourself look pretty when you're getting ready to die you're gonna die naked you may have 50 three-piece suits hanging in your closet or the most beautiful dresses since princess diana wore i want you to know it don't matter then you're going to die naked [Applause] i don't believe in god you believe in him there i don't believe in the devil you believe in him there it'll depend who walks through the door is it going to be angels or demons walk through the door to collect your carcass i'm here for mother's day and the flowers i got news for you god called you here this service to get you ready to die [Applause] come on church come on church whoever i'm preaching to on the internet ways let me just say if you don't know jesus [Applause] if you don't know jesus you're going to die one of these days if the rapture don't happen you're going to meet god you're going to meet the devil face to face you've lived like hell all your life don't be surprised when you go there but don't you blame god because god don't send you to hell your choices somebody help me preach your choice to send you to hell hey go to funerals and we hear the statements oh he's so much better off if he ain't a christian he ain't better off you want some hollywood preacher that smiles at you sure this ain't our time of where we have judgment and we put them this or that but that individual laying in the casket made their choice there'll not be a drunk in heaven there'll not be a dope addict in heaven there will not be a prostitute in heaven there not be a bob-tired woman in heaven there will not be a jezebel in heaven you can search all the way through it or not be one of them there there will not be a ball game in heaven there will not be a sports complex in heaven there will not be a rock and roll concert in heaven then why would you feast on hell while you're here wanting to live in heaven heaven starts down here you'll thank me for this kind of preaching one day you know i've had people tell me that when they bring their loved ones here you know if you could just kind of be easy actually had that maybe have a soft servant form they'll be all right you know you don't love them you're bringing them to the right place but you really don't love their soul if we're trying to get them to turn toward heaven and get their eyes off of hell we got to remember that satan is our enemy [Applause] god loves a sinner hates the sin i don't care if you're the worst homosexual in the world god loves you but he hates your sin i don't care if you're the worst drunk dope addict harlot prostitute in the world god loves you you're the one sending yourself to hell i'm just trying to be a help and a rescue agent from heaven but brother ron i hate to leave my friends i got news for you those are not your friends your friends don't give you drugs your friends don't point you to pornography [Applause] girl boy whatever those are not your friends brother on you're older you got gray hair i also had red hair carrot when i was a boy 18 19 20 years old and i had those kind of friends that were taking me toward hell most of them are dead now seeking their reward and because of god's grace and mercy and the death of an old man [Applause] [Music] hallelujah i'm like leah i can now rejoice i can now worship i can now praise the [Applause] lord colossians chapter 1 and verse 11 strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience long-suffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light now notice these next words who hath delivered us from the power of darkness you could not reach up to him amen you could not reach up to him he reached out to him that's right now you know this story tells us that jacob was left alone but he really wasn't alone amen because somebody had been waiting on him to get there maybe it was a church you walked into or a song that you heard on the radio or maybe it was somebody testifying to you that all of a sudden your heart opened up and said i need jesus what you realize you wasn't alone but god was waiting on you [Applause] zach he knew you were coming he knew you were coming so god wasn't nervous he knew all he had to do was be standing at the right place at the right time and he brooded on you and you felt like you were all alone and your life was a mess and you were tore up in life and you were destroyed in your nature and the only thing that would change you was god [Music] god knows how to get you alone he knows how to get you alone i hear sister nancy's testimony with brother homer when they went to the when they went to the meeting and sister nancy got the holy ghost first homer got mad she got the holy ghost first homer was fasting he was praying and he felt like it wasn't right that god gave her the holy ghost first that's right but god knew she needed it to live with him [Applause] [Music] [Applause] do you know that i invited him to listen to this service today i said you're going to enjoy this you're going to enjoy this how do you invite him i walk by his picture and i say homer i did my best today i want you to listen to the service you can enjoy this [Music] so nancy wrastled it out not because she was a good little girl but god knew what kind of plan that she had in her life god knew what leah had in her life and homer then met the same angel of god and his life became changed listen when you meet him it's more than this [Applause] then preachers begin to call him out you're called to preach you're called to preach and other people would look at him and go not him not him he won't be in church no town but you see he met an angel now i brought you an up-to-date experience now i want to take you back jacob was left alone and he meets a man and god don't talk to him he fights with him brother danny this ought to suit you real well he just fights with him god knows what it takes for every individual when jacob recognized this was god when he recognized this was god he refused to let him go now let me just say this to you the angel asked him his name the angel knew his name but he needed jacob to identify himself as a rascal you've got to come to a spot in your life that you can identify yourself that i'm lost i need god you can sugarcoat it all you want to you can powder sugar it you can do what you want to but without god you're lost but i got a predestinated seed you still got to get a birth easy believism will never give you a birth coming to churches sitting on a pew will never give you a birth being my best buddy will never give you a birth you've got to wrestle it out with god you got to die to your sins you got to lay it all on the altar god's not asking for half your life he's asking for all your life well i'm going to say i'm going to save those old dirty clothes just in case i don't make it i'm going to save those old dirty rock and roll just in case i don't make it i'm going to save those old dirty movies just in case i don't make it you ain't met god yet [Applause] i'm gonna be buddy buddies with those old dirty friends you ain't met god yet when you meet god it won't be you leaving your friends it'll be your friends leaving you jacob held on i could tell you about my testimony of holding on and the months of dying out to my self-will this is not abracadabra this is not two seconds of crying and whining and now i'm better now this is where you're really truly god feels sorry for your sins those sins would have sent you to hell and now god has made a grace provision for you that he's going to make a way for you you don't have to go to hell i want to make a way for you brother ron i i don't believe the message and i don't believe this and i don't believe that still there's a savior for you you don't have to go to hell whoever's listening to this right now you don't you may not understand nothing about william branham you not understand nothing about me or this church or the bride around the world but meet jesus and if you meet jesus he will lead you and guide you into all truth [Applause] you don't need to know all the top 52 doctrines of the church just to get in just meet jesus [Applause] just fall in love with jesus and let me just say if you ever backslide in your life you ever grow cold in your life which most of you will go through some of that summer winter fall winter experiences in your life where it feels like god's a million miles away just fall in love with jesus over and over again jacob held on the sun was starting to come up and the angel said let me go let me go he said i'll not let you go because i don't want to live another day like i have lived god wanted to hear that amen i don't want to live another day like what i have lived i'm talking to somebody here this morning you don't have to remain the same next week next month i find it amazing that one day in sin one day can put people in prison one day can get girls pregnant [Music] it ain't magic it ain't magical i don't know what happened brother on you know what happened sin happened that's what happened come to jesus that time sin takes you somewhere it starts you on a road you never thought you'd wind up where you wound up divorce court set full of people the richest man in america now is in the news that means money don't make perfect marriages having the biggest house in washington dc owning more land than any other person in the united states of america it didn't make bill gates a perfect husband when he gets to the white throne judgment and he's standing there god's not impressed that he was a computer guru how much their foundation give away whether you know that or not he's been skipping his taxes for a long time he puts his charitable donations into a foundation his own money into his own foundation that's a handy way handy way to skip taxes they want to point at presidents pointed some of these idiots they've been thieves for a long time finding out their adulterers their sin behind the camp so don't you make them kind of people your hero [Applause] let me just go to the regions of hell just for a few moments hank williams would love to sit in this service elvis presley would love to said hill marilyn monroe would love to take your place this morning and give her heart to god so don't make them a hero or some god somewhere another to point to they know there's a hail brother ron that's a little wrong no one just did what jesus just did jesus said the rich man when he was in hell [Music] because he couldn't wrestle it out in his life dimension whatever his life was he was rich but in hell he lifted up his eyes he got religious in hell and he said if you just give a drop of water on my tongue one drop let me just say in his life no doubt he had phenomenal servants that was willing to give their life to take care of him and a lot of families lived off of his wealth they looked up to him they saw a whole lot of him but when jesus looked at him he saw him in hell but there was a man that that was outside of his door that was a beggar god thought of more of that becca then he did the rich man in my hands i'm holding life and death and i'm presenting it don't get resentful in a moment like this this ain't the spot to get resentful [Applause] don't give me your excuses of why you can't serve god what are you stopping for the gift don't just work at the end of the service and god has taken out on mother's day the opportunity to give you a chance to turn your life around [Applause] and i'm doing my job i'm doing my job i'm trusting god because he told me if you'll trust me i'll use you like never before i don't know where this service will go but if you're on your way to you don't know jesus i want you to know you can meet him you can meet him he's a living god invite him into your life let him change you right now i'm gonna pray i'm gonna tell this story one time i'll probably never tell it again the rest of my life i was preaching a meeting at brother danny stevens brother jason jackson preached with me brother timothy pruitt preached with me but the tim pruitt preached with me and i spoke on the first morning there god showed me a vision and in the vision i saw myself going through the worst torment the worst darkness i'd ever went through and i began to go down in a in a ravine that had no bottom to it and it was the worst road that i'd ever travel as i traveled down this road the roads were tore up it was looks like earthquakes everywhere and i was walking and at first when i was walking there was light with me but then it became total night and it got darker and it got darker and it got darker and darker and on my way into this pit i led soul after soul to jesus christ and when i reached the bottom of the pit that i thought i'd never get to there was a girl there and i knew who she was and i asked her are you ready to walk out and she said now i'm ready and we turned and we began to walk out of that dark place and we walked and we walked until we walked into the sunlight amen at that point i didn't know i had cancer there's some things that god don't let you know let me just drop a couple things here hope you're patient with me just for a minute because i'm after a soul do you know that i had cancer throughout my body when god raised up brother doc and brought him back to life do you know i had cancer when that little girl came out of the wheelchair that couldn't walk you know i had cancer all through my body for the last they say eight to ten years when i led you to the lord god knows what you've got going on in your body even things that you don't know you got going on in your body amen when the doctor laid his hands on my knees the other day and i asked him the question how long will i be stage four he said you'll be stage four the rest of your life he said but every day is a miracle do you think that made me crawl up in a hole in one and say pity me i want you to know god sent me into this pit with a purpose he sent me in this pit with a purpose i refuse to walk out of it without you good [Applause] you can be seated i've just got a couple more things i want to say to you because i'm set from my heart we're not here to lose sister roxy we're not here to lose we're not here to lose brother joe we're not here to lose this is life and death that's right this is life and death it ain't a pretty flower this is life and death brett stephen jacob knew it was life and death when that girl grabbed a hold of the lapels of brother branham's coat she knew i did not want i do not want to go home blind [Applause] and she was looking for her daddy and the key words that she said to brother branham was if you can get me to the healer i'll find my daddy brother branham explained to her i'm not the healer neither am i the savior i'm not the savior but i want to lead you to jesus and she held on and matthew come she held on to brother branham's lapel and she held on to it and brother branham tried to get her to turn loose but she said those words if you could get me to the gila i'll find my daddy and he began to pray some 2 000 years ago her forefathers when you couldn't carry your cross jesus her forefather her granddaddy her granddaddy oh hallelujah elijah searched her lineage [Applause] in seconds oh he just said that let me just say this you brother brown just didn't say certain things no doubt god showed him her granddaddy carried your clothes god had a man there that would pick up
