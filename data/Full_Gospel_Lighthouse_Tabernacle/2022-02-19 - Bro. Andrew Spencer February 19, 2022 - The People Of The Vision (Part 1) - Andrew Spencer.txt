mindful of everything that we've been through and he'll be mindful to keep us the rest of the journey amen i want to continue to pray for our pastor brother ron he been very sick and uh i just got a note from him just a few moments ago he's he's feeling much better and so we're just certainly thankful for that so leron is going to do his best to be able to speak in the morning for you and if anybody has a right to stay out he certainly he certainly has that right but i understand wanting to attack the enemy when you're under attack it's the greatest time to attack the enemy is when you're under attack because you're ready for war so i believe that if god is able and i know that he's able that brother ron will be here in the morning if not you'll be able to put up with me i trust so man i want to make mention just to you for a moment tomorrow evening we'll be having a youth event at weir's cave community center for our young people from 12 and up that'll be from 5 p.m till 8 pm and it's for the 12 and up age range and i know the sisters have a few things planned for those uh so if you could be there and your parents you can drop them off or stay just as long as you come pick them up we're just responsible to get them out of the building then we'll leave it to you to get them after that so just kidding you know we'll take good care of them but seriously pick them up at eight o'clock you love the lord this evening amen we're so happy to have the farmer and the church family with us this evening such a blessing to always have you with us we're we're a great big body filled with one great big spirit amen if you have your bibles this evening would like to turn over in the book of genesis chapter 15 and then also over to habit cook chapter 2. before we read let's speak to the author of the word this evening heavenly father what a privilege it is for us as your children to be able to enter in to your house lord this evening lord to lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily beset us and run this race that is set before us father we thank you for the opportunity to be able to call upon the name of jesus that is higher than than every sickness and higher than every disease and every enemy has to bow at the name of jesus christ father what a privilege it is for us to be able to breathe that holy name we reverence and respect that name lord it's by that name that we are saved it's by that name that we are baptized it's by that name that we know that salvation is given unto us we stand here when we pray and we bind our faith together in that name for our pastor that you would continue to touch his body lord i ask that you would strengthen him and his innermost being and the cause lord jesus wherever it may be whether it's in the stomach whether it's in the brain whether it's in the lungs that's causing the sickness father we know we don't know what the cause is but we know what the cure is and we stand fast in the word of god holding on to it lord that you are a high priest of our profession and you are the lord our god that heals all of our diseases father as we step out of the way and yield our vessels unto you tonight we ask god that you would just come and enter in may you speak through the speaker and hear through the hearer and may you bless every person and every prayer and every need here tonight we'll be careful to serve you and give you all the praise honor and glory for it in the name of jesus christ and the bride says genesis 15 and 1 after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and abram said lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus and abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is miner and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowel shall be thine heir and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the lord what an amazing thing he wasn't able to number all the stars but he believed him it's an amazing thing to believe the lord when there is a huge obstacle that is in front of you he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness habitat chapter 2 and verse 2. and the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarry wait for it i'm getting old wait for it i'm getting wrinkles wait for it i'm getting a getting a little slump in my back but wait for it i don't know if i can hold on but wait for it because it will surely come and it will not tarry may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord i'd like to speak to you this evening on a thought of the people of the vision and that we are living out the very vision of god and we know we know that we are living in an hour where there's not been others that could operate in this realm that you and i operate in but this is the hour of the eagle and this is the hour of the anointing the anointing of the eagle that comes upon the believer that has the ability to be able to look past and able to look through prophetic eyes and have an insight to be able to see a vision that has simply that has been laying there but yet there had been a forerunner that went before us and told us these things and laid these things out in the scripture and i believe that we are the people of an open vision but and not a people of a closed vision but a very much open vision and we realize that that men when they when they don't have a vision maybe a vision in business they they they will wonder everywhere but if men don't have a vision in in their spiritual life they they can never go on and the bible said that where there is no vision that the people perish and when there is no vision that is set before you you cannot run with that race but there is something that is laid before the church of the living god and you can look throughout the bible and you can look throughout the old testament and it's and it's filled its field of prophetic insight but there were men there were men there that had had been born born a prophet and was able and the bible would call them seers that they were able to foretell the future and be able to look into the future and go out there and though they might be standing on the same dirt that you and i are standing on they were able to look out into another world and go out there and tell the future of israel or maybe maybe it would be good that they would he would the prophet would go out there and tell him that you'll come back packing the victory or or maybe he the prophet would tell now don't go out there you're going to come back and be destroyed he would come and he would bring the prophetic insight to be able to go there by the way of a vision that god would give him it was not a gift of prophecy that was upon him but he was born a prophet and this is this was this is a completely different aspect or a different avenue or a different channel than that of one that was a fortune teller or a median but this man was anointed with the very spirit of god to be able to tell things that are to be just like we had a prophet standing this hour and was able to reach out into another world and be able to tell us things that are to be and i'm so thankful to be living in an hour that we are not sitting here with a closed book tonight but we're sitting here with a prophetic mind tonight to be able to look out there and the bride has the mind of christ tonight and she knows what he wants done with the word and he doesn't want it left laying down he doesn't want it sitting there and becoming stagnant but he wants that vision to be rolled out and you to run with that vision tonight i want you to know that that the message that you're running with luther could not have ran with that message because he didn't have the anointing to run with that message wesley could not run that with this message though he was a great man under the anointing of the man age he was there he lived out and he purposed in himself to do exactly what god portioned him to do but they could not run the message that you and i are running with tonight they didn't have the eyesight to be able to reach into that realm with an ego anointing because they were living in a different age and god had so ordained these men that that god held them in his hands as the seven stars to the seven church ages and he knew and he built each one man with a certain characteristic that they would carry themselves and they would handle themselves with the anointing of that age but here we are in this last age with another anointing by by the prophet that would say in malachi 4 that surely i will send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord it's a great day for you and i but it's going to be a dreadful day for those that rejected this message that turned down to run with this message but god has a people that's willing to put their shoulder with this message and say i identify with that message i identify with that vision i identify with that prophet you see god had a man in his hand that he could entrust the very mind of god and he could go in there and bring that mind out and bring it to the people so you're not operating with with a closed vision this morning or this evening you're operating with an open vision is that right notice all down through those church ages that it was the holy spirit that was building a body in ephesus the holy spirit was building the body and through through the sumerian church age and the pergamus church age and the thytaran and all the way down through the dark cages even into the philadelphia and in this laodicean church age it was god the holy spirit that was operating and he was building himself a body that he had elected she didn't choose herself but he set her destiny he set her destiny before she could ever before she could ever run and that elect was is built to be a body and the elect will catch that message for her day and just like when when there would be others that would gather underneath paul's ministry when there would be men like john or men like men like polycarp that would come and they would stand under the anointing when wesley would come spurgeon would rise up underneath of him you'd have men in wigglesworth that would rise up under under under the anointing or the or the messenger of that day and here we are in the day of the seventh angel and there are men like william borlapon there's men like ron spencer and there's men like wayne lawson that run with a message that that prophet has came and delivered that message and i say he did well but you are not operating just as it just as a people that don't know what you're doing you're a people of a message and when you get to the running line you're going to get there and you're going to have the answer in your hand you'll be able to enter in and you will hear a voice that says well done my good and faithful servant [Applause] oh i ain't just going to leave it to the preachers god's raised up but god's raised up some andrew glovers but i'll say this god's raised up some jerry breedings god's raised up some tom hills god's raised up some seth ankles god has raised up some real sons and daughters of god they're operating by a vision and they know where they're standing at and satan can do everything he wants to them they're operating in a vision that can't be stopped [Applause] i'm in the vision i'm in the vision we are the people of the vision glory [Applause] now notice i know you know these things but just to set a precedent and brother branham when he would say in in the sermon what visions are he said a vision is god by a word of knowledge dropping into a person to foresee or foresee something that tells something that has been or something that will be now a vision does not heal you a vision is what god is showing to build your faith to a place to accept the finished work of christ at calvary he said how many knows that how many can thoroughly understand that there's nothing that i have to heal you or the vision won't heal you but notice he said now a vision will come to build a person now to think that if you took a person that may be maybe sitting there or in a condition where they were dying or had some dreadful disease but that man that man once he heard when she heard what the vision had spoke about him though he may have been dying or had awful disease by that vision he was able i can't explain how that you can appropriate enough faith and it don't even make sense sometimes but you notice when when a man may be dying or had some some have tuberculosis or cancer or some other shadow of death that would be upon him that that prophetic vision would be able to go out and say now i see you're dealing with this but thus saith the lord you're healed that man that it was stood taken place or that woman that it was taking place over that woman could have and appropriate enough faith it wasn't the vision that healed her it was just to show that the one that gave the vision was close and what was it doing it was taking that person that may be sick and body or maybe done with cancer he was giving him the ability to go from a dead man to a living man it was building him up it was taking him from a spot of death to a spot of life the vision didn't do it but his faith in what the master was doing was showing that the one that gave the vision it was not william branham [Music] maybe your maybe your pastor may have a vision about you but it's not it's not the man it's your faith and who brought the vision i want you to get comfortable and saying i am in the vision you see it's not the vision that makes you what you are god has already seen you as you are and you will accomplish everything that god has set for you in your life hallelujah vision can build you up just like when noah when he was building an ark what was he doing he went out there and it seemed ridiculous to everybody else but he was following a vision it seems ridiculous why in the world while there's a worldwide movement while there's a people following a vision that believes that this is elijah's ministry that believes that this is the message that'll get her out of this chaos it seems ridiculous to those that don't believe but we found our right mind when we found the mind of christ noah was out there working every day cutting down gopher wood sure he may have looked it like a crazy looked like a crazy out to the rest of the world but he was building that ark according to the vision [Music] are you with me now i want you to know that inside of that vision it had the power to raise noah above all the waves it had the power to raise him above every critic that vision had the power to shut the mouth of critics because it wasn't man constructed it was god constructed in 120 years he was living out the vision for 120 years he kept preaching the same thing and you get mad at me because i keep preaching on prodigals returning you get mad at me because i keep preaching on deliverance i get the preaching on the holy spirit and you get upset well he's preached on that before how about setting in noah it's gonna rain what's new today it's going to rain it will be this message that will raise noah out of the chaos oh hallelujah for 120 years he preached the message for 120 years he lived out the vision let me say it like this noah's life was the vision and when it come time for everything to run into that ark he was right in line with the vision let me say what happened in noah he walked in at one spot and he got out of another i want you to know you're servant of god that don't just know how to get you in he knows how to get you out well i come in down in elkton but you're gonna come out in glory noah stepped in in his homeland and he'd come out on mount ariat [Applause] i stepped in in canada but i stepped out in glory you stepped out in a hospital room but god seen you [Applause] i'm in the vision you can imagine noah's family we're right behind this thing everything he says i'm getting behind him sure it seems crazy but i'm getting behind him it seemed crazy until the rain started to fall this message seems crazy to a dying drunk generation drunk on her own vomit drunk on all things of the world on creeds and dogmas and she's a house of every unclean and caged bird it's crazy to them why you think the way you think but noah's family could say i rode that vision right to my destiny [Applause] noah's family got in and when they got out they were in a new place don't you brothers wish you could do some house transformation like that when she wants the curtains moved when she wants everything just wait just a little bit baby god's gonna open a door for you everything's gonna look different i'm gonna i tell you what you don't like what you're living at i'm gonna put you on a mountain help me jesus now notice in the days of samuel the bible said that the word was precious in those days because there was no open vision and a vision is the direct word of the lord he say amen and god has promised that he would always meet the need of the hour he always does that and that's what we need today is the very voice of god to meet the need of this hour what has been seen about you you will accomplish now notice in the key to the door brother baron said he said any key cannot unlock a door until it's used by hand it's got to have something to use the key the key itself cannot use itself it's got to have something to yield the key now it's not the way it is and now that's the way it is in preaching the gospel it's not that we ourselves are as ministers we are not the gospel but we are only transmitters that transmits the voice of god through our agency of man to the hearing a vision is the same way i know nothing to say to the church at this time concerning a vision but if the holy spirit would show me first division then i transmit that vision to the one that it's directed to so it's not me my the vision was not me i it was god that gave the vision and i acted as a transmitter to bring forth the message of the vision to the people he said now he said it's just like a key same thing he said the key is only to be held in that hand that unlocks the door see it's got to be a hand now in the key i'm going to speak about tonight is the only one hand can hold this key and that's the hand of faith it's the only thing that can hold this key and hands hold other keys but it takes the hand of faith for that you see just like as we said about the vision it takes a faith to be able to unlock if a man is sick or a man's got a disease or man's got some something going on or some case in his life he's got to be able to look by a vision and see a perfectly well body but it's that faith that takes him to that perfectly well body i want to say that over top of you is a vision of a perfectly well body i want to say over top of you is a vision of a people that's going in rapture over top of you is a vision of people that will destroy cancer that will destroy sin that will destroy addictions that will destroy all kinds of anxiety but it's you that's gonna walk walk right to the vision now notice just just just just delay some things isaiah isaiah prophesied 712 years before before john the baptist ever got on the scene he prophesied that there was a voice of one crying in the wilderness and when john stood there and he was preaching when he was preaching baptism those people could say we are in the vision of isaiah when when god would speak to isaiah and he would say that a virgin is going to conceive it seemed it seemed very unprecedented how in the world this man could make this kind of statement but when he come to mary she could say i am the prophet's vision when when when god when he would speak to jeremiah when he would speak to him in jeremiah 1 he said before you were formed in your mother's womb i knew you i called you i ordained you to be a prophet you see god has a long-range vision he's not caught up with where you are he's only caught up away you're going to be at and jeremiah had gotten to a spot one time that he said that i'll no longer prophesy in your name i no longer stand there in your name he said but the word of the lord is like a fire that is shut up in my bones i can't keep it out you see you can try everything you want to to try to stop the vision you can try to shut your mouse i could preach all day right there but i won't you can try to shut your mouth but the vision will come to pass the vision says you'll be here the vision will be just as it was spoken now now now i know i know all of you know this most of you know it maybe maybe some of the young people here don't know it but before brother ron became the pastor here brother ron was in christiansburg virginia and he was he was working alongside with us with his dad charlie spencer that just went off and went on to be with the lord but in the year 2000 or just before that when brother ron come to be pastor here the lord had given him a vision that he was pastoring at a church that had crosses in its doors and all of you old-timers you you know that that our doors back here jew used to have crosses in it and he went and told sister khan he said now look he said he said this is what i seen that i was pastoring a church i was pastoring a church that had crosses in its doors and he and when he walked through the building said this is that and we have it i could get it down and show it to you but it's about 15 feet in the air and i didn't want to get it down to see him because i might have broke my neck for a preach so i didn't do that but we got it back here if you ever want to see what what the vision was those crosses back there but i want you to think about the process of that vision you know god knew that that was going to come to pass god knew where he was going to be and he knew what year it was going to be at but could you imagine could you imagine life without that vision could you imagine could maybe maybe i'll just put some things out there i can't imagine living life without that vision this is my home this is my home church to think if that vision wouldn't have happened maybe you could put it in that way if the vision wouldn't have happened brother ron may not have been here in the mind of god it would have worked out that way but just just allow your mind just to drift for a moment what if the vision didn't come to pass where would my life be let me let me just break some things down for you i would i would have probably never been a preacher under a sitting there in charlottesville virginia i'd have probably never never been there or maybe not have been in that condition i may have never met my wife the way i met her i may never have the children away i mean everything is hanging on that vision and remember it's a direct word from the lord but let's look on the other side of the vision the vision happened and look at this church the vision happened and look at our young people the vision happened and look what brother homer stood behind look what happened full gospel lighthouse you are here because of vision i'd say it looked completely different today if it wasn't for the vision but we are at people by the vision for the vision and we are against division but even jesus said himself he said i can do nothing except my father first shows me he was operating in a world of vision there have been a lot of people that said no brother andrew or brother on go go lay your hands go create go do this thing go brother random go do this go go go go there's many people that tried to get man out of the will of god asked him one time brother branham have a vision for me he said well you dreamed me a dream he said it's impossible he said it's your faith that causes that he said i don't do that myself he said if i could do that i would he said but i can't do that you see you see the prophet was operating right where god wanted him to be and you remember when he was over there in africa and those men said they set him up and they told him and go do these things and he suffered he suffered a great deal for that and went through that trial great trial because he wasn't in the perfect will of god sure there was great things that happened sure there was lives that were changed but it wasn't the perfect will of god it was the permissive and that's where people get in trouble it's when they get out of the perfect will of god and get over on his permissive will yes god's a good god but he's also a good he's a good judge too yes he's a god of love but he's also a god of wrath but you remember when that this is this message is full of visions and i could preach this i could preach this forever anybody could come up here brother william brother matthew come up here and take these notes and they could preach these same exact things but i'm the one that caught the vision i'm the one that caught the vision to be able to preach that god dropped down a channel and brought the channel where i was sitting out and studying all of a sudden there came a voice that said speak these things you remember you remember about a little lady when that little lady had a little mexican lady down there and her baby had died early that morning and she'd come into that and she'd come into that tent and her baby had died and billy paul said daddy we got this woman back here we got this woman back there that's fighting through every ushers she's climbing over top of them crawling underneath her legs so what's it what's the deal billy said well the baby died her baby died and he said she's wanting to get to you and they had rules the way they had to set up the prayer line headline prayer cards and different things you know how it was and so he said no he said i can't go back there or it'll create a it'll create a people and they'll just they'll create a chaos and they'll come and they'll want everybody to come lay hands but he said brother jack you go back there and pray for that woman so you don't know me and as brother jack was going to go pray for her the lord showed brother branham a vision he showed him a baby a baby that was right or a baby that was living well a little spanish baby that that was crying and and it was perfectly well now notice brother branham said i didn't know if this was that baby or not he said but bring me that baby bring me that baby he said all i could do he said i'd seen the vision he said but this baby he said i knew what the baby looked like but this baby was wrapped up in a wet blanket that had been raining and that woman had been fighting just to get into the meeting wonder would you fight like that i wonder i wonder oh it's a saturday night i've worked all week long but would you really fight to get where jesus is at i will i don't know if it'll be me or not but the vision has spoken and the vision will be exactly as it was said he said i didn't know if it was this or not but i could sit there and he said i humbly he said i humbly bow my head and i begin to pray he said i began to pray and he said all of a sudden that baby let out a scream what happened that baby recognized that i'm in the vision that's me he said that baby began to kick off that wet blanket and started to scream because a mama was persevering and had love like that she began baby begin to kick off those wet blankets i'm afraid there's some message people that need to kick off these evangelists and pastors that are wet blankets that are trying to stop our pastors and trying to stop the move of god kick those wet blankets off of you i'm in the vision i'm where the holy spirit's at i'm going to stay right here on my fishing get that thing off me i'm coming out i'm in the vision kick them wet blankets off of you trying to give you some cold formal religion kick it off of you you need the fire of the holy ghost to sit on your altar [Applause] well glory jesus said i john 15 and 5 he said i am the vine and you are the branches and he that abideth in me and on him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing can you say that without me you can do nothing but if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned and he said if you abide in me and my words about in you ask i mean he's got him abiding in you tonight he said if my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you or you live in innovation where the word of god has said you can have it if you ask for it but the reason why you don't have it is because you don't ask for it but he said ask that your joy might be full knock and it shall be opened unto you what are you doing i'm just opening the door for the vision brother i'm preaching on entrance last week here let's just open the door i'm gonna go ahead and say it i'm gonna open the door for a prodigal to walk in i'm gonna open the door for prostitutes walk in i'm gonna open the door for drug ass to walk i was on the inside [Applause] rahab knows once you get on the inside there's a token life that's over the house how i just if i can just get you on the inside where jesus is out he'll get you out of this wall he'll make a breakthrough for you he'll have a way for you but when abraham starts having a convert a conversation he starts having a conference he said lord what are you going to give me see i'll go childless is ellie easter is eliezer going to be the only thing that my household is oh no i know you can't see it just yet but out of your belly out of your own out of your own life is going to come for the seed and out of that seed's going to come a seed and combination and out of that nation's going to come and

laying there there's a davis that's laying there you can't see it yet but look up at the stars your stars our mirror children are more than the stars up there you can't see it yet abraham but i'm going to give you a seat i'm going to give you a child and out of that deliverer is going to come a nation now that nation's going to come a king and his kingdom will have no end he will be king of kings and he will be lord of lords he will heal you he will deliver your people he will set them free can't you see i've caught you up in a vision to show you what you're looking at like this is your heritage this is your inheritance full gospel lighthouse let me lift you up just a moment no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper let me lift you up into your heritage that if god be for you [Applause] if god be for you brother jerry of god before you brother farmer of god before you brother saith if god be for you you tell me who in hell can be against you who in laodicea can be against you i've lifted you up so that you can see you're the people of the vision there's a rapture at hand you're that people [Applause] there's a message that's been preached and you're the people that carry that message [Applause] where was you job when the sons of god shatter for joy god didn't see you in defeat god saw you in victory he didn't see you being delivered and fought by by cancer all the rest of your life brother rod he saw you carrying out the victory there's a vision i'm in that vision i'm in that vision [Applause] never don't like no praising god around here but i'm in the vision i'm in the vision there ain't nothing you can do to stop me the vision can't be hindered the vision can be stopped this is the mind of god the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the lord i'm in the fishing i was standing in a vision with brother ron and brother wayne and we was having ourselves a honey bun standing in a coffee shop and brother wayne said brother on should you have that he said brother wayne i'm cancer-free [Applause] the vision has spoken well i'm going to walk right out of this valley lift my hands and praise the lord [Music] the god that is fighting for you all you see is a valley but god sees a mountain that you're going to rise upon [Applause] out of thy belly right out of you is going to come and live in water yesterday me and brother adam we we listened to more tapes headed down north carolina that you could probably put on whole time but we had them going we had church i believe in having church before you get to church that's my kind of church by the time you get to real church to the house of god you'll be so full on the holy ghost it sounds like something y'all been eating this week how's it huh brother i don't even know brother adam know what was going on we're sitting there with his listening blasphemous names who was going to brother brandon hit a spot and all of a sudden i heard a voice said your miracle is in the room that swept me from the about swept me from the truck right there i don't know how i'm gonna see that miracle i don't know how that miracle is gonna come to pass but i know it's in the room [Music] abraham it may not look like it's gonna happen but it's gonna happen sarah i want to tell you it's going to happen you can get caught up and i'm too old i'm too ugly i'm too fat i'm too short and i'm too heavy i'm too wide you can get caught up in all of your complexes and all of your ideas sarah it's going to happen you're attached to the miracle stop trying to have your miracle through everybody else stop trying to have it through the maiden stop trying to have it through hagar stop trying to have your holy ghost experience through the pastor through the mama through your daddy stop trying to have it through everybody else and have yourself out of you's got to come a vision and that thing's got to speak well i'm not going to do it the reason why you're not going to do it because you're backslid reason why you're not going to do it i preach this microphone reason why you're not gonna do it's cause nobody's willing to yield themselves to you you're afraid you're afraid if somebody would actually get a hold of you you'd actually sing out oh don't do it if somebody actually got a hold of you you might actually preach if somebody got a hold of you you might actually clap [Applause] what's your name oh i'm i'm sure are you sure you're sure if somebody you see it takes somebody that's willing to take that microphone somebody's got to be willing to say i will be a microphone for the holy ghost i will let out a shout i will let out a praise i will let out a hallelujah stop sitting there in your backsling condition you ain't lost you just lost your first love well this joy that i have all the world didn't give it to me [Applause] i want my joy back we'll get it back you want your salvation back get it back there's a price that's been paid you are redeemed [Applause] there's a predestinated people that will receive that promise just like when he came the first time there was a people that were ready to receive it sure he came to his own and his own received him not but to them that received him to them gave him power to become sons of god but when he comes in his second time there's a people that's ready to receive it notice notice he said now he said i want you to notice he does it that way in every age he does it he does it time he does it every time by the same method he has to take believers and then in order to to have believers to meet that word he's got to predestinate to that age you see it he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age do you get it do you feel it do you see it do you understand it that's what's happening today he predestinated it to this by his foreknowledge when he predestinated in malaphia malachi 4 it's got to happen and when he come over and he predestinates anything to happen in his word he had to prove it his word to be so and when he predestinates anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there he's the one that set this up well i came in and i didn't get to sit in my spot tonight he set this up [Applause] he knew what you wear [Music] brother brother andrew you have no idea it took me 45 minutes to do my hair and i come out and i looked at my husband and said does it look good and he says what he always says of course honey and i knew it didn't look good what's wrong with you i want you to know there's a vision about you and you can get upset all all throughout your chaos of life well the check didn't come through on friday like that paul said it would my car my car broke down got a flat tire on the way to church i knew it was god's will that i'd get a flat tire i just didn't feel like being a church tonight and you can go through all of your laodicy in life and not live they ought to see you you can go through all your troubles you can go through all of your torments but there's a vision that's been spoke about you you know there come a time for the preview of the bride and when she walked by the first time she was spotless she was sinless brother ma'am said she was beautiful she was dressed she was dressed like a bride should be dressed she wasn't dressed like that american that come out in the church that was led by a witch but she come out she come out she was young around 20 years old he said she was beautiful he said then i had to watch the review of the churches he said they only come by once he said but the bride come by twice he said i was sitting there thinking is this the best that i've done how am i preaching is this all that i've done and the voice said but the bride will come and preview again you got i got houses off i got houses i got mirrors ain't got houses i only got one of those but i got mirrors throughout all of my houses because i live with three women i barely get a bathroom so i had to be one outside it's not an outhouse but it's outside the house but there's mirrors all over that place you'd think a good thing we ain't superstitious one of them things break man we have bad news seven years time seven hole 490 lord forgive me but all those mirrors are in there they ain't for me what am i talking about i actually do look at myself every once while but i ain't like brother jewel and sister vanessa and she said ah lord i hope you don't think you look good but what that mirror is for let me preach to myself i don't want everybody i want i want everybody to say amen right here not just the brothers or the sisters but that mirror is there so you can look at yourself do i do i look good how's my hair look got one mirror for this side and one mirror from that side every sign i've ever looked at for me ain't never been good but what are you doing your wife says now honey do i look okay yes ma'am you look good you look better now than you did 20 years ago baby brothers that was your moment amen i'm gonna have some flash cards up here for you next time this is when you say amen this is when you say hallelujah praise god [Applause] honey you look great and the brother said we're getting there i'll have him there by the time we get out of church sisters honey do i look good what is she doing she is trying to look at that mirror and she's trying to get a display of herself but she comes before her groom and says do i look presentable to be able to walk out in public that's what a preview is it's a display before you go out into public it's a preview before you sell something off before you ask something auction something off you go to the preview and the bride is improved you and the prophet was able to look at you by the vision and said you're perfect you're sinless your blood washed blood bought birthed by the word of god you're dressed in the material that it takes to get out of here you fit the bill you are a purpose you fit the vision oh but i felt like i got out of line every once in a while but there was a voice that said get back in line the main thing is you're in the vision in the vision he was looking at me i don't have to have my name caught on tape i don't have to have a vision shown over top of me and tell me where i've been at and where i'm going i already know that i don't have to vision tell have to tell me i know what i'm stacked up against i already know that every devil's got its gun gunning for us but i have been seen in a vision oh it would do so much for me brother andrew to be able to hear my name to hear myself or see myself in the vision i'll just give you a display and the bible says now are we the sons of god year of god little children and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world there won't be nothing to stop this vision i was a sister one time in canada i was a sister one time in canada had come through a prayer line and the lord discerned her very heart it said y'all see that you're barren and you have no child but i also see i also see that you're you have a terrible disease of tuberculosis said but thus saith the lord you are going to have that child years passed by she went back to her church told her pastor told her pastor what brother branham had said about her said over top of her and her pastor laughed at her her pastor laughed at her and said you said that man must be some kind psychologist psychiatrist or a mind reader and she began to doubt what was spoken over her but her husband said but wait [Music] he said thus saveth the lord and this woman she fell into a spot of tuberculosis and was laid up in a bed for eight years eight years because doubt began to enter in because a pastor turned down the voice of truth so when brother branham goes back through canada and he goes up there and he he sees it man you can listen to it on tape just look up mr doble he said mr dover he said what's the welfare of your wife he said she's bedridden with tuberculosis and he began to tell brother branham the story about all this to take place he said but why did she doubt the vision said well it waited for so long it lingered for so long she just began to doubt he said i had the vision and the vision is never wrong he said it can't be hindered and he went back through there he went back through there several years later and there he got a phone call that sister noble was healed of that tuberculosis and she had that baby boy he said you're gonna have an eight pound baby boy and when she come through he has she had an eight pound baby boy that's amazing brother andrew this woman was in her 50s and the promise had took place years before it didn't matter sarah was 90 years old but god made a way you couldn't stop the vision isaac had to come out hallelujah you can't stop that vision for coming to pass it doesn't matter what's been said or what's been going on in your life the vision cannot be stopped [Applause] well caleb when he stood there in numbers 13 and 14 when moses sent out when he sent out 12 spies to go over in that land they didn't come back they didn't come back and say their mother tim was wrong but they said that we're more than able to take it there's grass we look like grasshoppers compared to them giants over there they didn't argue with them they just simply said we're more than able to take it what were they looking at they were looking at the vision that this was their land i was listening brother branham this week and he said speak to the rock he said now here those men come back he said he said it was a good land he said there they were in all those years he said they'd never ate such such food like they were getting ready to enter into he said they were only given slave rations he said but there was a land over there there was a land over there that they carried back that cluster of grapes that it took two men to be able to carry and brother branham said he said you think about that land he said you think about that land he said if a cursed land could produce that kind of grapes he said what could it produce when it got blessed you think about your life and you think about all that all how that you have been blessed throughout all your life and you ain't live for them one day you think about if you're living in a cursed life you just wait till you get into a blessing what kind of life you're really going to produce you think about you think about when you come back packing the evidence of the holy ghost and every single time you come back packing out the evidence of a land there's going to be an enemy that'll rise up say hey it's too big for us but there's going to be somebody that'll be a caleb said we're more than able you know why caleb was able to do that because the bible said that he was of another spirit and you are not like the church world you're of another spirit that same spirit that dwelt in jesus christ dwells in you we got some evidence to talk about we got some gabriel spencers we got some sarah spencers we got some kimberly martin sitting here we got some kayla sitting here we got some nathan noel sitting here we got some jim noel sitting here we got some tom hill sitting here we got some mountain frasers sitting here we got evidence that it's a good land [Applause] so you young people look up if they can do it you can do it we got evidence that god still heals we got evidence that god still delivers you want some evidence there was a lady one time that was it that was in a prayer line it was in a prayer line and there was a sister bruce you heard about her own tape and sister bruce was a prayer warrior and she was healed one time of cancer and then she was a prayer warrior and she got a burden on her life she would get a burden on her heart for somebody and she'd go to praying about them and brother branham was he was he was in a line of discernment one time and sister bruce was praying for this sister and at that moment the spirit of the lord began to discern her heart and tell her how things were and this lady was dealing with throat cancer she was dealing with throat cancer and had this great big lump in her throat he was going to kill her and the doctor said that she wouldn't get well but the spirit of the lord began to curse that cancer he cursed the very life of that cancer and thus saith the lord you're healed she went home and that lump was still there she went home and could still barely swallow but brother branham said she went to a coffin fit said she went to a coffin fit and when she began to cough brother branham said that cancer jumped out of her throat i'd say it's time that cancer gets a jumping fit and jumps right out of the body of christ you're not welcome here we have cursed the life of cancer we have cursed the life of pornography we have cursed the life of anxiety [Applause] you've been given power to bind that mamba in the name of jesus christ whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven oh hallelujah where two of you are free together in my name there i will be in the midst of them cancer's got to jump go ahead let him jump go ahead and kick that crab out he'd go ahead and he can grab on your life he'll grab on your life and all kinds of sin he comes in there to kill to steal and destroy he don't want to just make you sick he wants to kill you but god has come to give you life and more abundantly [Applause] you will have full victory it's time the body of cancer starts moving out because we don't curse the life of it we done cursed the life we didn't curse the life of all kinds of diseases off of you we cursed the life of it now it's time for the body of it to leave all cancer is is a bruised cell and it starts attaching itself to other cells and it starts binding itself and it's demons calling out for one another they're calling out for help and they start grabbing on and they're going after every bit of the life i'm going to take this good sale i'm going to take vernon frazier i'm going to destroy him i'm going to take jerry breeden and i'm going to destroy him i'm going to take davey braden and i'm going to destroy him i'm going to take shannon shiffen and i'm going to destroy him and he comes in and the devil's coming there to destroy every bit of the life that you got you ever went through life and you feel like you ain't got no more joy left in the end of your bottle for the week i will tell you what you got can't run out you got a hold of some new wine now you try to take kiss and put it in an old vessel and it'll make it bust yes that's what happens it'll make you bust and you watch some people and you watch they get underneath it underneath this new wine and under underneath this revelation man they just bust up they got to get out of here but you put that new wine on the inside of a new vessel and you watch that thing you watch that vessel say hey i can live this i can live this and all of a sudden life comes on the inside and it starts pushing cancer out it starts pushing diseases out what are you doing you're taking the very word of god and destroying those bad cells if you could just grab it in your mind just for a moment as the word of god goes forth and it's going over and there is a body we'll call it cancer as the word of god goes over and he begins to restrict and it begins to bind up that thing the very life goes out of it you remember brother branham when he binds that mamba he said that mamba began to choke its own self he began to choke its own self it's time that cancer gets cancer and leave [Applause] i'm talking about more than just a brother on situation right here i'm talking about more than sister erica parker's her situation right here or anybody that's facing cancer but i'm talking about the disease of sin it's time that sin start taking its leave in the name of jesus christ but the angel said you just be more sincere it ain't that you ain't sincere but it takes more sincerity satan i adjure you by the power of the living god take your hands off of
