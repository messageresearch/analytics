it now in Jesus name we pray amen and amen if you have your Bibles with you this morning i' ask you to turn with me to the book of Colossians Colossians the first chapter and we're going to read there from verse 13 Colossians 1 and13 ain't it good to be a Christian this morning amen we sure appreciated the presence of the Lord here last night appreciated the part you played in that as you pulled on the word and as you entered in and worshiped with your whole heart as as you always do we thank you for that we appreciate you so much Colossians 1 and 13 and pray you'll just have Grace for me this morning I have quite a few things I'd like to to read and maybe it won't be the same Pace as last night but I believe that that God's in his word and we're going to have a good time amen verse 13 says who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God that's something we're going to be looking at today the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist amen I pray that the Lord will add a blessing as you have your seats this morning there to the reading of the word also want to read one verse in 1 Timothy 1 1 Timothy 1 and verse 17 says now unto the king Eternal Immortal invisible the only wise God be honor and Glory forever and ever amen amen so I'd like to speak to you this morning on the thought the Unseen becoming manifest the Unseen becoming manifest or the invisible being made visible amen so so the scripture here makes it very plain as as we read through the scriptures that God is a spirit and also that being a spirit he is invisible amen John 4:24 tells us that God is a spirit and and we just read there in first Timothy that he's invisible so we worship an invisible God and that's just something that that we understand we worship an invisible God and and if we start there in Genesis 1 and look through the scripture we we we see there that that he begins to create the heavens and the Earth but but if we go back Beyond Genesis 1 and and really the only way we're able to do that is there was a prophet in this day that that took us back before that time but if we go back Beyond Genesis 1 but back before um the what we would call the beginning if we go back before time ever began back into the eternals as it were where there was no moon and there was no stars and and there was there was no nothing and really for us that's very hard for us to to grasp that's hard for us to wrap our minds around because we're time creatures everything we've ever known is time we Mark time and hours and days and months and years we have calendars and watches and don't want to be late church starts at this time and the the party starts at this time and I have a birthday everything marks time but there was a time if I can say it like that I'm I'm contradicting myself here there was a time where there was no time okay there was a time where there was nothing and and though those things um um there was nothing once again we've always known tangible we've always known the world to exist and to be able to touch things but there was a time when there was no time and there was nothing there there was nothing tangible at all and and and in that time it was before God was even God right you know because God dwelt all alone with himself there was no one and there was nothing to worship Him and therefore since nothing could worship him he wasn't God because God is an object of worship so at this point maybe we'll just call we could call him the great Eternal one the the Great eternal spirit you know and he was invisible but all that God was and all that God is all of his word and all of himself he wanted to become manifested he wasn't going to let it always be invisible he wasn't always going to be alone he wanted it to become manifested he he had you in his mind he had the Earth in his mind and he wanted these things to become visible amen so if we go back to that place before there was anything the prophet says and there that great space where no one can fathom in their mind beyond that that space eternity that's Jehovah God out there and we're taught in the beginning that the logos or the Son of God went out of God so as we start right there the logos was a part of God that went out from God so back there in this place that we're talking about where there's no time there's nothing just empty and in that time the logos comes out of God so so the logos comes out and brother Bram says that the logos was God's first body form he would describe it as a a little white light or a Halo and it was the son of God it was the word of God the logos that would later become flesh amen so as the logos comes out out of God this light would be the first time that we could ever describe God as visible it's the first time that you could ever see God because Spirit God is invisible but this light the logos was part of him and it was gone out from him and it was a visible manifestation of God Amen it was the word of God it was the son of God and it would become flesh and dwell amongst us the prophet said so he first was god Jehovah and out of him let's just picture now a little drama so you can get it let let's see coming out of space where there's nothing it's a little a little white light like a Mystic light like a Halo and that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning that was the son of God that came out from the bosom of the father that was what was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us in the beginning was God and then out of God came the logos a part of God that went out of God and I just want to labor on this a little bit because we're talking about the the the invisible being made manifest or or the Unseen being made manifest and the prophet says setting way back in eternity there was God and then going out of God or God unfolding himself comes the logos which was the son of God or the word of God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us he says the logos so so I want to drive something home here just very early on is that the word of God will always be made manifest the word of God will not remain invisible it will always produce what it was intended to produce amen the the the word will not remain unseen if will not remain unfulfilled it will not be sent out and return unto God empty okay in other words it didn't come forth out of God and him still remain invisible he didn't speak this word or this part of him didn't come out and you still see nothing but when the word or the logos came forth immediately we have visibility immediately there's something that we can see we have a manifestation we have something that we can see and say that's God that's God Amen John 1:1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now we take this as Believers and we read and we go down to verse 14 John 1:14 it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us now we connect the two scriptures right there it's just obvious to us right that the the word was with God the Word was God and then the word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and we see Jesus right there and because of that we see one God it's obvious to us and and we see that the word was there but but to to other people they read right there and they see where it says the word was with God and and they make it two co-equal separate deities because it says well there was there was there was God and the word and the Word was with God and so they see two to two co-equal co-eternal deities but I want to explain something right here that the language used here does not indicate another person being with God but it is an indication that God has changed forms it's showing you a change in forms the the logos has come forth from God and that logos is visible he has gone it's just saying God has gone from invisible to visible you can now see him or simply put it's another expression of God it's God unfolding himself it's God expressing himself he has now become manifested and I'll use a word we're used to using in the pillar of fire god is now visible in the pillar of fire when Moses met God in the burning bush what was it it was the logos it was God made visible the word came forth from God and as it did it manifested God or it made an invisible God visible amen because God's word always brings forth God's word always manifests itself it always does to to to the human eyes the promise may still be invisible this morning now stay with me for a second it may still be invisible it's still only a promise it's still only a word but the Fulfillment of the promise is what makes it become visible there comes a time where the promise that you're holding is going to become visible it doesn't go out and return empty right now it's still invisible right now it's just a word but what you're holding on for will become made manifest it will become visible because it's not always going to remain just in word form it must manifest that word hallelujah the prophet says and now I can see him as he moves over here and he draws into his memory or his mind a picture of what the world should be now there's not a star or nothing I love that he draws in his mind the great architect there before there was anything the great designer of it all drawing plans up in his mind and I want to tell you that this point as he's drawing those plans up in his mind as he's thinking these thoughts it's all already done it's all already finished because his thoughts are Eternal and his thoughts are perfect he doesn't have to rethink them he doesn't have to redo them right there while he's sitting there thinking of what it's going to be like he already thought of the earth he already thought of you he created the Earth to draw you out from the earth right there you were already going to be here you you are you are an attribute of God a thought of God and and the Earth is as well and he creates the Earth what for to draw you out from that Earth he's already thinking listen it's already finished the victory's already won calvary's already happened redemption's already happened the rapture's already happened it's all being sealed the minute he thinks it he can't go back on it the minute he thought it right there it was already finished hallelujah it's all done brother Brown says I can hear him say let there be light and an Adam burst Yonder and the Sun come into existence deity she begins to whirl millions of years rolled by and after a while a piece flew off it star he says and he stood there and watched it and it went all down and he stopped it over here after it fell a few million years off went another one he let it fall to a certain place and he stopped it what's he doing he's got in his mind now that that someday there'll be an earth there'll be mankind on the earth listen he said let there be and it didn't matter how long it took he said let there be and it didn't matter if it was millions of years it didn't matter if it was billions of years those thoughts was already in his mind they were invisible they were only thoughts but then they became a word released and when they released the word it was still invisible even had you been there to hear him say it it was still invisible but the Unseen was going to become seen the Unseen was going to become made manifest the invisible was going to be made visible the the the word was going to take on the form of what it was spoke to do he said let there be light it didn't matter if it took a million billion years there was going to come light that word wasn't going to return unto him void listen stars were coming Earth was coming mankind was coming what am I telling you your Victory is coming the healing is coming the Deliverance is coming your health is coming the body change is coming the Rapture is coming it's already been smoked it can't be stopped now it can't be put back in the toothpaste do been squeezed out can't put it back in the tube it's going to become manifested once it's spoken it's got to happen light was coming it had been spoken it will be seen the word's already been spoke over you brother Aaron I'm in the darkest time light's coming I'm in the hardest time your Victory is coming that word wasn't just released into nothing it was released over your life there was a word released over the Earth and we get caught up in time because we're time creatures and I've been in this trial 14 years now brother Aron I've been in this trial now for three years now brother Aaron that's okay Victory is coming the answer is on its way it's already been released in The Invisible now the victory that's invisible to you the healing that's invisible to you that the things that haven't become clear will be made manifest in your life Hallelujah listen I know it I I know it's written down in the Bible I know it's in our mind I know it's in our heart we read these things and we believe it but if I was you I would start to take those words and I would start to put them on my lips and I would begin to speak the things I have need of the prophet of God told us that when a when a Believer takes the word of God and puts it up on his lips it's the same as deity speaking he says Every Mountain has to move Satan cannot stand before that mountain so I just want to say that if deity speaking this word created the galaxies created the Stars created the worlds then deity speaking this word can bring healing to a body it can bring Salvation to a soul it can bring restoration to a home what you need this morning speak what you have need of speak what you have need of take it and put it on your lips and speak it and watch it manifest a visible victory in your life Hal hallelujah what does manifest mean manifest in the dictionary means clear to the eye to make evident or certain by showing or displaying amen a promise isn't manifested until it happens if if I'm speaking of the past and I tell you something happened and it didn't happen then I I lied all right if we're talking of past events that that that's just a lie okay but when speaking of the future anything I tell you is going to happen the truth of it is yet to be determined the truth of it even if it's not a lie because sometimes it don't happen because of circumstance but it's only truth if it happens do we understand so so if I tell you something the truth of it is yet to be determined no matter what if it doesn't happen it wasn't truth regardless of intention regardless if it was on purpose if it doesn't happen it wasn't true it's just not truth so so physical words spoken or or or or written words have no truth until it happens there's no truth until it manifests the the the Manifest ation of those words into something tangible into fulfillment is what makes it truth amen and that goes for anyone that's right and that goes for anything God is only as good as his wordu prophet of God says if God made a promise God's got to keep his promise if he doesn't he isn't God he said that's the way you do with healing you throw yourself at his Mercy he promised it it's his word he's got to he's got to fulfill his word if he isn't he isn't God he says in no man's word or no man is any better than his word if I don't keep my word then I'm not much and if God doesn't keep his word he isn't God but if God does keep his word then he ever remains God in order to be God he's got to keep his word you see he's got to keep his word you see I could tell you that I could just give you an example and say well okay well you're moving on Tuesday well brother I'm gonna come help you move and I could mean it I can mean it with my whole heart yeah I'm going to be there every intention perfect and pure and yet due to unforeseen circumstances I'm unable to come through on my promise now you can say a lot if you want but let's just lean this way and say what I said was wasn't the truth well I said I had pure intentions so I mean I wanted to come move your sofa down the stairs I promise but things didn't work out so what I told you was not true it was not a a true statement and yet here's the great thing about God is God's word cannot be derailed by circumstance okay because God's not a time being like we talked about so he's not speaking from a place of I'm going to he's not speaking from a place of I'm going to he's speaking from a place of I already did it you're already healed you're already saved I was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world he's given you fulfilled promises he's given you promises that he's already come through on he can't be unsain a he's already slain you can't be unhealed by his stripes you were healed he's speaking from a place of It's Already Done circumstances can't change what it's already been done for you in your life Hallelujah he's already delivered you he's already fulfilled the promises that you're standing on but right now it may be unseen but I want you to know that the invisible is about to be made visible in your life those things are about to be made manifest it's going to be manifest because the word has been released and it's got to accomplish its goal in order for him to be God hallelujah why because it's truth and truth is based in fulfillment so if it's truth it must be fulfilled I ask you is God's word true today then prepare for the Fulfillment of the Unseen the things you've been longing for hoping for holding on to they're coming maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but they're on the way that's the word of God it must come to pass Hallelujah Full Gospel Lighthouse you can't lose it's not death's going to be defeated death's defeated hell's defeated the graves defeated Satan Eden is defeated it's done today hallelujah it's already done you can Rejoice that the Unseen is going to be made manifest his word is eternal it's unchanging I'm so thankful it's unchanging I'm so thankful he can't unchoose us I'm so thankful it's not in the hands of fickle men I'm so thankful that I don't have the final say in your life that doctor don't have the final say in your health his word is unchanging he said Your name's on the Lamb's Book of Life I can't take it off you can't take it off devil can't take it off you're going to be there he said he's heal he's healed you sickness can't overcome you you're going to overcome it these aren't my promises to keep they're his promises oh everything's falling apart but he said I will have a church without spot or without wrinkle so it's going to be there it's going to happen I don't care and if this one Falls and that one Falls he will have a church Hallelujah it will be made manifest his word unchanging what what good does it do us to talk about the Miracles if he ain't still The Miracle Worker what good is it to talk about the blood if it's lost its power what good is it to get the Holy Ghost if it don't keep us from sin come on now the Holy Ghost gives us power over sin it keeps us from our sins well I got the Holy Ghost brother but I'm still struggling with pornography I just say it no you don't because he sent the Holy Ghost in This Day in its fullness and with the fullness of that and the adoption age it gives you the power to overcome to lay aside the sins that so easily beset you hey I know I was up I was down I struggled I was in I was out but one day I stepped into the presence of the lust the pillar of fire and it changed my life forever where I couldn't now I can where I fa now I stand I am an overcomer and it's not by what I've done but it's the power of the invisible God being made visible in my life Hallelujah he's still God today his word is still the truth today and every promise will come to pass exactly as he said Hallelujah hey we're going to do this again but if I hadn't been I'm sorry love you buddy so it's faith in the Unseen that eventually makes it seemen faith in The Invisible ible is what's going to make it visible look we don't live by sight I'm not telling you to go around living by sight we live by faith but our faith will be made sight that's the whole point of Faith it's not just to walk around in faith never seeing anything fulfilled I believe in focusing on faith you know but it's kind of like this I I believe in prophecies but eventually prophecy got to become fulfilled prophecy can't say prophecy forever or it ain't true it's got to be fulfilled a lot of people fall in love with the prophecies and hate the Fulfillment it's exactly what happened with the Pharisees they loved every one of the prophecies but when the Fulfillment stood in front of them they didn't like it so our faith has to become sight the prophet of God says now if God makes a promise in the Bible and then if you receive that the supernatural promise will make a supernatural manifestation because God will vindicate his word absolutely so the whole point so far God's word's going to be made manifest amen God's word comes by hearing and and we know that and we believe that and we don't have to see the Bel we've been taught well enough to know better than that but we're going to see because we believe amen there are many many examples down through the scriptures where those who who who would look to the Unseen with faith and therefore the Unseen would become seen Noah never saw what fall from the sky Noah lived in where there were no clouds it was a blue sky all the time never seen a cloud before but God released a word that said it's going to rain and it was invisible and it remained invisible for 120 years amen it didn't matter though that it took 120 years it was a word that was going to come to pass no matter what and because Noah believed that that that that God's word must but to pass then he was prepared for it and I want to say right here that your preparation to receive shows how much you believe that's like the third time I've rhymed and I'm not trying to please yeah your preparation to receive shows how much you believe now if Noah got that promise and he went and sit around and done nothing and made his wife kick him out of bed every day hang on now and sit around going guys it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain well what are you doing about I'm just just trust me it's going to rain but there was no preparation to receive what he was professing to believe then I don't care how much he said it was going to rain Noah didn't believe it was going to rain okay you know it's kind of reminds me of Zachariah there in the Bible when the angel came and said to him you're going to have a child and he said how can this be you know what if you if you read Zachariah and his wife have been praying for a child but then here comes the Fulfillment he says no that can't be come on and it makes me wonder are we expecting to receive the things we're actually praying for are you expecting it to happen are we living every day in expectation because a lot of us are saying there's a Rapture coming there's a Rapture coming there's a Rapture coming and you are doing nothing to be ready to take that Rapture but I'm telling you if you believe the rapture's coming there's a preparation to be made you got to apply the token you got to get in the ark you got to check up you got to make sure you got to live daily as if this is the day because I'm expecting it to happen this very moment your preparation shows how much you believe right what does expect mean because I say we got to leave live with expectations expect means to believe that someone or something will arrive soon it's not a maybe so it's not a hope so it's expectation and I've used this example before but you know how it is when you're expecting company you tend to go around and tidy up some things and make sure things look good and make it look like it never does unless somebody's coming over I'm talking about the yard my wife's house always looks good I'm talking about the yard I weed eat things I don't usually weed eat and mow things a little better because companies's coming I'm expecting them but you know what happens when they show up unannounced is sometimes they find things may be a little unkempt they find things in a condition that i' have rather them not find it in because you want things ready when they show up what I'm telling you is a prophet has come and made it very very very very clear that he's coming that he's on the way and it's going to happen in this day you don't have an excuse for him to find your house unkempt you don't have an excuse for him to find your yard not ready to receive him I'm telling you get ready wake up quit hitting the snooze button get up because he's going to show up and I don't want you to be caught unprepared we got to be expecting him he's coming company's coming he's coming soon get everything ready live ready talk ready act ready do everything ready to go because he's on the way I want to know are we expecting him to show up are we expecting it to manifest the Rapture can't always in promised form it's got to manifest itself it's got to happen and there's got to be a people going I know it's going to happen I'm expecting it to happen I'm going to receive it when it happens hallelujah it's expectation and I believe God has proven time after time that he's trustworthy that we can trust him that he keeps his appointments that he does what he says that his word never fail we got to be under expectation every single day every single service this is the service this is the manifestation today is the Fulfillment it's been so far unseen by my natural eye but today is the day today is the day I always think about Abraham sitting there in the tent door watching what if that had just been that day where he said you know what I've sat here every day you know I'm just going to go over here for a little bit bit and the Lord passes right by the tent and he misses it we can't take a break in our watchfulness we can't get we can't get sloth in the way we live our lives we can't get too comfortable we can't get too comfortable down in Babylon to where when the king said go back and build the city almost none of them went back because they'd been comfortable living where they were living live mixing with the Babylonians listening to Babylonian music feeding on Babylonian entertainment wearing Babylonian garments they had become comfortable listen we all we we we it says it's like a smoke that comes up from the bottomless pit you ever gone camping before and then like a maybe a month later find something that you somehow know didn't get washed and what's it still smell like smoke Smoke Gets In Everything Smoke Gets in every crevice it gets in every little place that isn't sealed there's smoke all around us today there's fog all around us today I'm telling you make sure everything's sealed up because if you don't it gets in and it affects your life and people can tell when you've been around the campfire because they smell the smoke keep it sealed up that way we have to walk through this world but that world ain't getting in on the inside of us yes we got to walk in it we got to live in it and we're here but I'm telling you it's not our home it ain't where we're stay in and when I get there I don't want to what's that smell what is that on you no sir I want to know when I walk through it I'm so sealed up so airtight that none of it sticks to me none of it gets on me none of it affects my life none of it affects my home because I'm living in expectation that we're leaving this place it's got to become made manifest Hallelujah you know Mary said be it unto me and we celebrate that when the angel came and promised sir but what would happen and how would we look at that if she said be it unto me Lord according to Thy word and then the baby never came what kind of story would that be what would that be if it just forever remained in the form of a promise but that's not that's not what happened because Mary Laid claim she said be it unto me and and she didn't feel anything and she didn't feel a change but she took the word and the promise was made manifest as our Lord Jesus Christ the prophet said that's the way Miracles are performed when God is took by his word The Impossibles Are Made Real the invisible becomes visible God's word's always going to become made manifest brother and you said that a lot I'm G to say it a lot more I taught middle schoolers for years my job was just to pound stuff into their head if they remembered one thing at the end day I was happy God's word's going to become made manifest because he can't lie his word is the truth he has to keep his word to be God now as we when we reach this time in history we talked about the logos Before Time and now we just brought up Mary as we reach this time of Mary to a place where God actually comes in the flesh and when he comes in the flesh once again what it is is him vindicating his word everything that had happened until now now in the scriptures and in history had pointed to this coming it had said he's coming it had pointed ahead it was a promise there was promise in scripture Time After Time the woman's seed shall bruise the Serpent's head Behold a virgin shall conceive he's going to bind up the Brokenhearted he's going to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and they were all just words that were invisible amen but there came a time that the invisible became visible and he stepped into that body and there comes a day when all the scriptures that were spoke of him every scripture every word everything in the Old Testament everything there was is fulfilled in one man Christ Jesus and what it is at this point is God has further unfolded himself from the logos he's further unfolded from logos into the man Christ Jesus and Hebrews 1 tells us that he was the express image of Goden Colossians 1:15 said he was the image of the invis visible god brother Brown says and Jehovah God the logos who brewed over the Earth and brewed over the first man Out of the Dust of the earth overshadowed Mary and brooded over her to fulfill his word and created the blood cell that brought forth the son of the Living God I believe in a body he was a man I believe in his soul he was God he was God's manifestation here on the earth he says God come in the flesh Jesus Christ the logos that went out in the beginning how back in the beginning no one could see God then the logos come out then God manifested himself down in man and now Jesus begins a Ministry and this ministry makes God visible he begins a Ministry that unveils what was hidden and that that manifest the Unseen and and the invisible God is now walking around in a body upon the Earth and yet people still couldn't see it he's made visible and yet they still couldn't see it they would look right at it and couldn't receive it and as I said earlier we have to be willing to recognize fulfillment when it comes because it's not always going to come the way you expect it to come it's not always going to be exactly the way that that that you were taught it doesn't match the way maybe mama taught it the way maybe daddy taught it and or or it doesn't go in a way that makes us comfortable but fulfillment comes anyway whether or not you receive it's up to you because before it was made plain many times we get it all figured out this is how it's going to be brother Andrew and we set up these parameters within our own thinking and then we try to take the Fulfillment and stuff it within those parameters and say this is how God's going to do it this is how God's going to move and and that's exactly what happened with the religious leaders of that day in their mind it had to be a certain way it had to come to their denomination and he's going to come down like this and he's going to come to caiaphus and he's going to fight off all the Romans and it's going to be our group it had to be exactly how their Church interpreted it exactly how their Church taught it and here comes the word made flesh God unfolding himself in a further unfolding and he walks down right in their midst and because of their Traditions they couldn't see what was being made visible right in front of them because of their ideas because of their family traditions because of what Daddy taught me because of this idea that we hold on to in our family they couldn't see what was being made visible right there and even testified to John's disciples he said the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf here the dead are raised the gospels preached to the poor see notice it wasn't just the invisible made visible in flesh but it was being made visible in the works that he did he brought God visible because why the works were of God he did what only God could do and in the midst of all that even though the most of people rejected him there were some whose eyes began to come open there were some who were able to recognize because some began to compare it to the word they began to look back in the scriptures and say how does this match up with what the scriptures say listen I believe if we start taking some of our questions back to the word some of our worries back to the word some of our what about this back to the word we'd have a lot more testimonies and a lot less debates there'd be a lot more less of well he said she said listen I don't care what they said what does the word say about it what does that that settles the situation every single time brother you're entitled to your opinion you're entitled to the way you see it God bless you but I'm GNA be like David when Saul tried to give him armor that's great for you but I know what works I know what brings Victory I know what brings healing I know what killed the lion I know what killed the bear I know what brought me out it's right here it's the unadulterated pure word of God and I'm going to stick to this right here [Applause] here hey you may overcome however you need to but for me in my house I'm going stick with the word of God I'mma stay right here hallelujah it's never failing he talks about the disciples there talking about how they began to read the word and he says no one can create but God God's the only Creator there is and he took five little bit biscuits and two little fishes and fed 5,000 take up seven basket fulls when nothing could do that but Jehovah the same one that rained down bread out of the Skies there's only one so they're they're looking at the word and they're comparing it says and here he is known amongst us in the humble form of a carpenter an ordinary man here is Jehovah that lived in the heavens that no one could see the invisible God is made visible here Among Us for we know him he does the same works that Jehovah did Messiah was supposed to be Jehovah Emanuel God With Us and if I don't do the works of Emanuel if I I don't act like Emanuel my works is not like emanu then I'm not Emanuel but if you can't believe me just watch The Works that I do they testify of who I am sir he was the manifestation of the invisible he was a word the word in a body doing the works of Jehovah and he's saying listen if you don't believe believe that's who I am then at least look at what I'm doing at least look at what's happening that that God is being manifested Before You by The Works it was in John 14:11 he says believe me that I'm in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sake look I understand you you can't see who I am because of my birth I understand you can't see who I am because I didn't go to your school I'm not part of your church I understand that but if you can't believe me at least compare what I'm doing to the word of God compare the works that are happening to the word of God they testify of who I am they make Jehovah manifested in your very eyes and yet as blind as the religious leaders of the world were and the majority of the people there there were others who eyes just continually began to come open IA was being applied listen there's always somebody's going to catch it brother brandom said God's always always going to have somebody that he can put his finger on I'm telling you let others not be able to see it others say I can't see it somebody's going to catch it somebody's going to hear it somebody's going to look back in the word and go it's truth it's truth it lines up It lines up think about it why is it why is it that you see it so clearly you see it so plain and man sometimes you think oh I'll just tell them I'm explain to them serpent SE that that's easy you know that's a I'm going to show them baptism they just said they can't see it they think you're crazy and I'm sitting there reading it so plain as day how are they not seeing it it's more like how do you see it you Lord You're predestinated to it and it calls your name I got a simple analogy I like to use if I'm walking through the airport and I'm walking along it don't matter how important the message is coming over the loudspeaker if they're calling for Henry Cooper I just keep walking that I it may be a very important message it may be urgent but it ain't for me I don't need Henry Cooper's message and I keep walking along and they say you know John Thomas it's very important that you report it's very urgent I just keep walking it don't matter but the minute it says Aon ogles be everybody else keeps walking cuz it don't mean nothing to them but it called my name it's my message I'm going to go find out what my message said he said it's urgent I'm coming back I'm coming back get ready it's an Urgent Message and it's calling your name and you hear it and you respond cuz it's for you Hallelujah it called your that's why others don't hear it others don't see it it's calling your name Hallelujah there's always somebody that catches it because it calls their name it's not per chance it's not an accident it's it's predestination there's always somebody who recognizes the life they recognize the works because it's family you see family in the store you recognize it I know them you see God move in service and some people can't recognize it is that God you sitting there and you recognize it because you're of the same DNA you're from the same logos you recognize it because a part of you that's in you in the same thing that's in that you say that's God that's God moving in our midst we're attributes of the same Source we're going back the same place hallelujah hallelujah it's wonderful the woman sitting at the well her eyes came open she recognized what the works we know that one's coming that's going to do these things it was The Works Nathaniel saw the works and he said Thou Art the Son of God the DNA in him recognized the DNA in Jesus look at the woman who washed Jesus's feet there at the party I'm going read this to you brother Brown says look how filthy she was but something struck how many can testify to that she seen the word of the promise from the Garden of Eden This Woman's seed shall bruise the Serpent's head she seen the Messiah that had been born of a virgin she heard he was to be born of a virgin but they but they had heard the man was on the earth she heard there was a young Rabbi Prophet who healed the sick she believed that and here she come down the street walking around looking around she looked over there and seeing that great party going on she slipped up to the fence and looked through and there he was there he was and something said that's him that's how it is in a service last night when he begins to move others are like what is that what is that but those with the same DNA go that's him that's him right there she said that's him see that's all she needed to be inspired what happened she seen the word of God made flesh she heard with her ear but now she saw with her eyes and what she do in that moment she come comes down and bows down at his feet and she begins to weep and cry and worship and and she washes his feet with her tears and she dries his feet with her hair and I say that's how we all should act in his presence that's how we all should act when he comes around I'm going to give you my everything I may not have much even if it's just my tears I'm G to give you my tears and that's how we all should be free in his presence but many times we'll play the part of the Pharisee what gives her her the right to dance what gives her the right to worship like that do you not know the life she lives I'm G say something here and it's just how I feel so if if brother Andrew or somebody like to correct this that that's fine so if this is a seed in the pie just spit it out but a lot of times we'll look at somebody that's been struggling maybe they've been out in the world maybe their life ain't tip toop absolute perfection she maybe that sister ain't the one you go no there's a proverbs 31 lady right there maybe that's not who she is or maybe that's not who he is however you want to say it and they get touched in a service and they get to dance and they get to shout and they get to praising God and we want to sit there and go but I know what they were doing yesterday how can that be God that's a sh well let me just take it back the way I believe it brother brandham taught very clearly he never said dancing was a sign of the Holy Ghost he said dancing was a sign of Victory now this is just a simple analogy and how I feel about it so this is just me but if somebody comes up here and they've been possessed by a hundred devils and they're ate up with with a hundred Devils they so far from the Holy Ghost and that that you can't hardly explain it but in the midst of prayer or in the midst of service one of those Devils gets crushed one of them one of them that's a victory and they got every right to dance on their Victory they got every right to praise God for that Victory I got 99 Devils but I got one left that I had a minute ago I've been set free of that Spirit now I'm going to kill another one and kill another one and I'mma dance every single time all the way to complete total Victory if they get a victory let them Rejoice let them have their victory dance why would we say well they still got so much on them instead of saying they got less than they had a while ago they're one step [Applause] closer I had a young sister come up to me one time at the front of a service very Supernatural moment and I won't go into it all but I knew she was tormented I knew a lot of the things and she came up in her opening line to me was this is the only place I don't hurt this is the only place I don't hurt and we want to take their freedom from them in here they're bound up out there they're tormented out there they're struggling out there I say in here let them be free let them be free no judgment no torment just free to pray prise a living God just let them keep coming back to the well coming back to the well freely coming back to the well and eventually they'll get the hold of the real deal they'll get a hold of it it won't just be a dance outwardly but their soul will be saved they'll be change forever just let them come back to the well we'll move on let's be like the woman because the whole time we're sitting there judging the whole time we're wondering if that is that really the spirit of God moving somebody's at his feet worshiping somebody's getting delivered somebody's getting saved all the while somebody's getting delivered and you're wondering all about your questions and your criticisms and he's being made visible right there in your midst and then you'll walk around and say I want to see God no you don't come on you want to see what you think God is manifested you want to see your preconceptions manifested just let God be God how about you worry about you and let God worry about manifesting how God wants to manifest and don't miss it when he moves recognize your opportunity in his presence recognize him when he's in our midst no God enough to know his ways speak to God enough to know his voice know him enough to recognize him when he moves spend enough time with him that he's not a foreign person when he comes through the service well I didn't see Gody you didn't recognize him because you ain't talked to him in a long time that's right look I know how it is I I love you people I don't just say that I love Full Gospel Lighthouse please don't ask me if I know your name my my wife not only she my alarm clock she's my name person I love man I see people year after year love them know them shake their hand good man I love that guy watch's now his brother sometimes you catch me reverting back to high school it's not this cuz I don't know like what's up bro because you don't talk to them every day that's right they're not part of your life every day so it's hard for you to remember their ways their voice who they are what they do for a living and it's the same way in the house of God you ain't recognizing what's going on around you because you ain't communing with him enough when he does something to make himself visible recognizes him when he heals the sick when he saves the sinner when he discerns the thoughts and repeats your conversations it ain't because somebody told it let it just be like the disciples Copus and them that went on the road to EMAs when Jesus did something that they'd seen him do before they recognized him for what it was they recognized that's him we've seen him do that before and they knew it was him and it lit a fire in them they didn't stand up and go well let's debate this could it possibly be him I'm not sure if it's him because you know he might would have maybe it would have come like this oh that they saw something and they got up and they strolled back towards Jerusalem to find their Brethren to say Brethren that's not how it is come on they saw God move and it said they ran it lit a fire they came out their Pew they were dancing they were shouting why do you do that not because somebody said something good or sing a good song because you saw him move you said that's him he's alive he's here I got got to tell somebody I got to tell somebody it's Jesus he's manifesting himself in a Sunday morning service and I see him he's moving it's the same God that was here in the 50s and 60s he's still alive Hallelujah you can choose to see what you want Pharisees saw what they wanted to see others saw a carpenter others saw a man with illegitimate birth but others saw God can we lay aside our ideas today and see God Can you lay aside our preferences and see God I say it a lot I maybe I've said it here there's nothing wrong with preferences brother Andrew it's okay if you like this song better than that that's fine this style better than this style that's fine man we're not all going to be the same my daughter was telling me the other day you used to love to jam your music and now it's like turn it down turn it down it's like it happens get ready I know a lot of you probably seen it but it's the truth I said I I'm at that age to I turn the radio down so I can see better we're not always going to get on the exact same page the problem is when we make our preferences spiritual your preference ain't no more spiritual than my preference it's what I prefer it's what you've prefer that's okay I've said before we ain't all going to be best friends we ain't all going to hang out all none of that matters we're here to see Jesus we're here to lay aside those things and see Jesus I want him to be manifest right here this morning in this service in my life in your life in your life in your life Lord Jesus make yourself manifest here today that's what it's all about Hallelujah when he moves here and people shout and people dance and people scream what do you see what do you judge it what do you call it because I choose to see God moving in the hearts of men and women and them responding just like those on the road to Emmas I love this quote right here brother brandham says I believe that the same God that fell on the day of Pentecost upon his church as a pillar of fire and divided himself with clothing tongues among his people is here tonight amen it's the same God he was then he is today with the same Holy Ghost now listen close it's a paradox it cannot be explained emotions screaming crying and so forth you put what you want and so forth flopping flapping you put whatever you want and so for screaming shouting There She Goes whatever you want to put in there he says it's a paradox he says but it's a paradox how God does it no no no no no that's not God that's sister God no it's a paradox how God does it it's the Unseen God dwelling in the human heart I'm going to reread this in case we lose it we're talking about jumping dancing screaming emotions he says it cannot be explained emotion screaming crying and so forth cannot be explained it's a paradox how God does it it's the Unseen God dwelling in the human heart making himself visible by vindicating his word that he's the same yesterday today and forever listen the next time that the Devil comes and tells you you need to be ashamed of your worship that you need to be ashamed of your dance ashamed of your scream ashamed of your cry he said your worship makes an invisible God visible what am I doing I'm manifesting Jesus in my dance I'm manifesting Jesus in my shout I'm making an invisible God visible by the way I worship I know he's here cuz I see you worshiping him I know he's here I see the effects I see God manifested in your worship it's just emotion nope I'm making God visible it's so much more than you've ever realized you make him manifest your worship makes God visible we running out of time it always makes you nervous when you say something like that and nobody says preach on brother say run out time you hear that kind like amen first amen he said all day all right few more minutes we're going to try to wrap this up feel like I almost lost y'all here we go we're going Jesus was the word of God made flesh and his ministry in that body made the invisible God visible I'm going to try to get to the cruts of this thing he was the fullness of the godhead in a body and there came a time after he finished all that he was in the groom form that he was taken up in the Ascension and he returned to what we would call invisible the body was gone but but he promised that we would still be able to see him if we turn to John 14-6 he says and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me me because I live in you you shall live also and at that day you shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he he he it is that loveth me he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him the whole world's blind they can't see but you shall see him he's not invisible to us although he's still the invisible God we see him we seem him all the time we seem in the manifestation of his promises we seem in the Fulfillment of his word as that word becomes fulfilled it's visible to us and now we can say and here's what we've been trying to get to now we can say that the word being made flesh isn't just a 2,000 year ago thing it's not just the body of Jesus that's going to be a flesh body that manifests the Lord Jesus on the Earth but in our day the invisible God has been made visible once again look the logos the pillar of fire that that knocked Paul off his high horse the logos the pillar of fire that met Moses in a burning bush the pillar of fire that led the children through the Wilderness came and met one of his prophets in Houston Texas in 1950 and became visible to the world once again and in that moment it wasn't just the elect it became visible to the whole world to declare I'm back I'm here I've come in the fullness and the pillar of fire is back with the church again it's been made visible once again and once again he comes down and He makes himself visible and what is it it's an unfolding and he begins to unfold himself once again there in the groom form he was manifested to those who could receive him and then after 2,000 years he comes again in the fullness of his word through the promised message of Mal 4 which unveils him to the elect it's a further unfolding it's the invisible becoming visible the Unseen becoming manifest and the prophet said they believe though they've never broke into this yet to see that great shika light both spiritual and physical in so much that a mechanical eye of the camera keeps taking the picture just two weeks ago it caught it again you're revealing yourself Lord the might God unveiled to the believer still veiled to the unbeliever but unveiled to the believer now what was this as as Malachi 4 comes on the scene and a message BEC begins to come forth we had God in the beginning unfolded into the lust and then down through the word he unfolds and then he unfolds himself into the human body of Christ Jesus and then here we are again with another unfolding and Malachi four steps on the scene and he begins to unfold himself in what we would call the word coming and he begins to unfold the word it's the word coming of Christ and it was for the purpose that the elect might see him that all that had been hidden would be revealed and all that had been invisible would now be seen and once again many couldn't receive it even though they testified of The Works we've talked about it before the the books that we read a man sent from God Prophet visit South Africa all the different ones you could name those weren't written by message Believers there there were no message churches that's what the denominations were saying they were saying Bible days are here again they were saying this is a man sent from God this was them testifying of the works even if you don't believe I am who I say I am the works testify of who I say I am and they had to testify of the works but those that had isaf those that were of the logos word DNA from from before the foundation of the world this message made God visible to them and it brought the Unseen World into Plain View and it didn't come in word only listen this message came in powerful demonstration this message came in Victory and with healings and with Miracles and the supernatural abounded in this message our eyes didn't only hear excuse me our ears didn't only hear but our eyes saw in this day brother Brown says now you have seen his presence now your eyes have seen your ears have understood and God has confirmed before your eyes his presence that what you feel at this time that condemns you when you're wrong and tells you not to do that that same God has become visible to you here this afternoon by his works and yet that wasn't the end of the unfolding that wasn't the end of it because the word coming was to produce a bride coming the word coming wasn't for the purpose of God sending a prophet God didn't send a prophet so he could say I sent a prophet we read Malachi 4 and too many times always sees Elijah but Malachi 4 says behold I send unto you're in there just as many times as Elijah's in there this message is about you this message came to call you this message came to collect a bride to bring a you are literally the spoken word word Bride of the last day had it not spoke we wouldn't be here it spoke us into existence the word come and came to produce a bride coming a match piece for Jesus Christ who has taken the word and eaten the word and has become the word because why it's God's desire that he be manifested that his life be made manifested listen it was manifested in many different ways all down through the Old Testament and it all culminated in Jesus Christ the groom but now 2,000 years later God once again in a body the prophet of God will tell us that Jesus fulfilled everything that was written of him in the Old Testament he said but his bride is going to fulfill everything that's in the New Testament what is it what are we who are we we're the ones made up of all those attributes that he thought back in the very beginning beginning I'm looking at hundreds of his attributes and just like every other attribute they were made manifest in due time listen you're not late you're not ahead of schedule you are right on time doing exactly what God called you to do standing where you're supposed to stand in the age you're supposed to be in in the church you're supposed to be in manifesting the works of Jesus Christ to a Dying World I say if you don't believe we are who we say we are then look at the Works believe the works look at the overcoming life looking at the movement of the spirit look the blind see the death hear the lame walk Cancer's healed people live overcoming lives it produces what it said it would produce hallelujah what are we doing we're making God visible we are manifesting the Unseen God we are Christ manifesting where is Christ visible where is Christ manifested and you and you and you and you and you he unfolded into the logos he unfolded into Jesus he unfolded into the fullness of the word and he unfolded into you you tabernacling the logos you manifesting Jesus you making the invisible God visible listen it's the day of manifestation brother Andrew look out in the world man the seeds are manifesting what they are there's a people walking around literally manifesting The Works of Satan to where you can literally look and see the body of Satan walking around on the earth then I say if that tree has come to its maturity there's a bride tree that's been restored and fruits are beginning to come out on their branches and if they're manifesting where they're from there's got to be another people manifested an invisible God that testifies where we're from who our King is where our home is our lord Jesus I want my life to manifest him Hallelujah the Unseen becoming manifest in this day you can go ahead and stand to your feet with me it should throw us into desperation today if our job is to manifest Jesus what type of people we ought to be what type of ministry what type of Life ought we to live because the promises cannot remain invisible John 14:12 is got to have skin on it Mark 16's got to have skin on it the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to have skin on it the Rapture is going to take place listen the parable about the prodal son wasn't put there just for a parable it's going to be made manifest in the lives and the homes of men and women who believe for their prodal by my stripes you're healed can't just float out there in word form forever it's going to be made manifest in the lives of men and women who believe it I will have a church without spot or wrinkle it can't just be word the truth lies in the Fulfillment how's it going to happen how can it be me brother Andrew how can it be me brother I just I I just can't see it the devil tells me the devil questions the devil listen let the devil question Jesus was questioned every single day of his life Satan would look back couldn't be no that can't be him surely they said Carpenter that illegitimate surely not then he killed him and said I knew it I knew it I want to tell you what every question the devil ever had was answered one day with a knock on the door and suddenly that door flung open brother brand said he kicked him back into hell he ripped the keys of death and hell off his grave off his side listen he didn't have any questions anymore he said that's him that's him that's who he is hey he may be questioning you right now let him question but one of these mornings when I take a body change when death is under my feet when hell is under my feet when the grave is under my feet he's going to have to say that's her that's her it was her all along we're going to manifest the resurrection and the Ascension once again in this day we are she hallelujah we're called to manifest The Works of Jesus Christ we're going to make the invisible visible the Unseen will become manifest Hallelujah God bless you church I love you with all my heart Hallelujah [Applause] don't you just Worship the Lord this morning just worship Him hallelujah oh Lord God

been I stood today and I witnessed Jesus really close am I witnessed Jesus really close because there are things that brother Aaron has no idea about that's right no way could he know and we witness the power of Jesus Christ take a man from Louisiana and allow the word of God to do what he said he would do that it would be a discerner of the thoughts and the Very intents of the heart that it would cut it would go to the mirror of the bone so I recognize that a man has yielded himself to the witness of the Holy Spirit and has benefited the Bride of Jesus Christ for the glory of the kingdom of God for that Full Gospel Lighthouse we are thankful we are thankful that a man can be so yielded that he could come right down through your ten Can Alley and the word of God could witness to you and you would see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's right we're the Most Blessed people on the face of the planet to say that we have recognized our opportunity in his presence and we've literally watched the invisible made visible right here it's manifesting time we are in it we just want to give brother Aaron and his family a hand clap a praise aome and thanksgiving for coming by our [Music] way I love all the Dynamics of the body I love how every minister is built different how they study differently how they look at something something different and I thank God for evangelists like this that can come in and be a benefit to the body of Jesus Christ and I love how that God does those things he can take one word and just make it so personal to you to that we are a witness that Jesus is amongst us we're going to let you be dismissed today I want you to go reverently I want you to go greet one another I want you to do something for me today somebody that you don't typically go out and shake their hand I want you to go out of your way and I want you to shake their hand I want you to make them feel welcome let them know that you love them that let them know that you're praying for them can you do that for me amen God Rich bless you as you're dismissed in the name of the Lord go in the fear of God in Jesus name amen [Music]
