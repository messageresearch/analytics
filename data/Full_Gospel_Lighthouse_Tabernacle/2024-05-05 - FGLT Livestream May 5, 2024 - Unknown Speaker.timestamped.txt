[44:02] us and I just imagine the angels of God
[44:06] sound exactly like Sister Abigail and
[44:09] she has such a beautiful voice I heard
[44:11] and sister Gabrielle they team up
[44:13] together they might just take us into
[44:14] Heavenly places and amen don't God just
[44:18] have the best of the best amen amen it's
[44:21] good to be in the house of the Lord
[44:22] today isn't it we certainly have enjoyed
[44:25] the our time in the presence of of the
[44:27] Lord this weekend and we as we always do
[44:29] we're certainly thankful for the spirit
[44:31] of the Lord that is amongst us and uh
[44:34] today we just want to make an
[44:35] announcement to you as a church and then
[44:37] to our viewing audience as well we know
[44:40] that we have our Labor Day meeting that
[44:41] is coming up this year and uh here in
[44:44] September it'll be August the 30th 31st
[44:47] and September the 1st and we have
[44:48] invited brother Timothy brother Tim puit
[44:51] and brother Donnie Reagan again this
[44:53] year to be our speakers this year and
[44:55] we're very excited about about that and
[44:58] and as you all know we're the Lord is
[45:00] adding uh adding members to the church
[45:03] and uh quicker than we can keep up with
[45:05] and we just see what the work of the
[45:07] Lord is doing and what's amazing to me
[45:09] is to watch how the Lord's is not just
[45:11] is not just coming from different
[45:13] churches but the spirit of the Lord is
[45:14] is grabbing Sons and Daughters of God
[45:17] right off the streets and different
[45:18] Avenues of life and and I just I just
[45:20] love how the message is at work and you
[45:22] realize that we're not serving a dead
[45:25] God but we're serving a living God and
[45:26] it's it's a it's a living letter and we
[45:28] are watching the very physical
[45:30] attributes of God being made manifest
[45:32] right here amongst us that being said
[45:35] our our church is growing exponentially
[45:37] and um as you know here it it it gets
[45:40] rather rather tight here sometimes at uh
[45:43] at church and so we have decided we
[45:46] we've uh earnestly prayed about this uh
[45:48] for quite some time about how to house
[45:51] this meeting how to handle it so we have
[45:53] decided this year to take our Labor Day
[45:55] meeting to Mont VI Middle School right
[45:58] up there uh right there in mville area
[46:01] it's right there behind actually brother
[46:03] Vernon brought this up last night it's
[46:04] right there behind brother Bill Hinkle's
[46:06] property there right where our church
[46:08] started years years ago and I believe
[46:12] from our our understanding is that is
[46:14] Brother Bill Hinkle's dad's property
[46:16] back in the day and so we I've asked the
[46:19] brothers if they could just kind of cast
[46:21] a a picture of what the auditorium looks
[46:24] like it can house about 600 uh 600 uh
[46:28] comfortably there and then we can set
[46:29] out seats and it'll give us enough ample
[46:32] space to be able to we haven't been able
[46:35] to have a choir be able to sing in our
[46:37] Labor Day meetings uh for for quite some
[46:39] time but we will now be able to have the
[46:42] space to be able to have choirs we'll be
[46:44] able to have the have the space to have
[46:46] prayer lines if we would decide to have
[46:48] that we were we would actually have room
[46:50] to be able to have altar calls and
[46:52] worship and and we're just we're very
[46:55] we're very thankful that we were able to
[46:57] find a facility and it's actually
[47:00] brother Roger and sister an Sailors
[47:02] their their grandson is the assistant
[47:04] principal there and we just felt so
[47:07] comfortable dealing with Brother Brad
[47:09] the other day just dealing with him and
[47:11] just we we prayed about it and ask the
[47:13] Lord is this the right thing to do
[47:14] because it it's it it means a lot to
[47:17] have an atmosphere where you can have a
[47:20] Revival and to take it from this this
[47:23] church building to take it to another
[47:25] facility it's a huge thing but we felt
[47:27] we felt inspired by the Lord to do these
[47:30] things we looked at different facilities
[47:32] for the past uh past little bit and this
[47:34] one just this one just felt right and uh
[47:37] all of the all of the details of it
[47:39] being on brother Bill Hinkle's Grand or
[47:41] his father's place and right there
[47:43] behind brother Randy and brother Bill's
[47:44] Place and we just we just felt very very
[47:47] moved to have the meeting there so if
[47:49] you want to you can invite your friends
[47:51] you don't have to be afraid about space
[47:54] now and and I know that there are many
[47:56] that have reached out to us and said
[47:57] they wanted to come but they didn't know
[47:59] if they would be able to get in the
[48:00] building and things we will now have
[48:02] ample space to be able to house some
[48:04] meeting in and uh we just we want you to
[48:07] be praying with us about that and I know
[48:09] that'll be a it'll be a big undertaking
[48:11] for all of our musicians and sound guys
[48:13] and and things but I believe that I
[48:16] believe that the Lord will bless it
[48:17] abundantly we are intending to have our
[48:20] dinner just like we do every year uh or
[48:23] until until uh sister Wanda says we
[48:25] can't have it there no more we're
[48:27] planning to have our dinner that Sunday
[48:29] at Spotswood High School so we'll leave
[48:32] Mont videoo and then go to uh spotwood
[48:35] high school and if you're watching
[48:36] you're not familiar with the area it's
[48:38] it's about 10 minutes from from the
[48:40] church here is where the meeting will be
[48:42] at and we just we just wanted to bring
[48:44] that before you as a church congregation
[48:47] and and I want you to be praying about
[48:49] that and we want we want all of our
[48:51] visitors to feel welcome and and know
[48:53] that that they are welcome to come to
[48:55] these meetings and I believe that it'll
[48:57] be a great blessing it'll be a great
[48:59] blessing to the Lord and you know we're
[49:01] just we don't know I I believe that the
[49:03] Lord could come back today that's my
[49:06] anticipation I believe that he could
[49:08] come back before the preaching of the
[49:09] word ever takes place that's that's my
[49:11] heart but we have to make plans we have
[49:14] to make plans for for the future and uh
[49:17] so we just want to uh be mindful of that
[49:20] and just just to kind of make a note
[49:22] there there is a time limit on the on
[49:24] the evening Services we will have to be
[49:26] be out of the building by 11:00 so is
[49:29] what I've been told that the alarms will
[49:31] sound off you can you can worship all
[49:33] the way up to 10:45 but get out of there
[49:37] so so I I told him I told him you know
[49:41] it ain't the first time Cops been called
[49:43] on us so this time it'll be for
[49:45] Spiritual reasons
[49:47] so but so the so that being said the
[49:51] times of the services will we will
[49:53] adjust the times uh just to kind of if
[49:56] if we feel that we're going to have a
[49:58] prayer line we're going to be praying
[49:59] about those things but we will adjust
[50:01] our times for that meeting and uh we
[50:04] want to make sure that everybody's got
[50:05] ample time to be able to get off of work
[50:06] on Friday and things of that nature so
[50:09] we'll we'll reach out and send out a
[50:11] flyer put it on our church Facebook and
[50:13] different things like that so everybody
[50:14] has all the details and you'll uh you'll
[50:16] be able to share that with uh with your

[57:27] and he was preaching the evidence of the
[57:29] Resurrection it's almost the middle of
[57:31] the
[57:33] sermon and he says oh Lord if I have
[57:35] found Grace in thy sight strengthen this
[57:39] feeble body renew my strength and renew
[57:42] my youthful strength as you do the
[57:45] Eagles and put my head high and Lord my

[58:41] four amen God bless you and God shall
[58:45] wipe away all tears from their eyes what
[58:48] a
[58:50] moment and there shall be no more death
[58:53] I hope Satan is listening
[58:56] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[58:58] there be any more pain for the former
[59:01] things are passed away and he that set
[59:04] upon the throne said behold I make all
[59:07] things
[59:08] new what a thought and he said unto me
[59:11] right for these words are true and
[59:15] faithful and he said unto me it is done
[59:18] I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[59:21] the end and I will and I will give unto
[59:24] him that is a thirst the Fountain of
[59:26] Water of Life freely and he that
[59:29] overcometh shall inherit all things and
[59:32] I will be his God and he shall be my son
[59:37] you may be
[59:40] seated this is every one of us our our
[59:43] expectation in our
[59:44] future a place where there's no more
[59:47] death nor sorrow nor any of those things
[59:50] that we have to struggle with anymore
[59:53] that's what our future that's what I
[59:54] hope for maybe this morning you haven't
[59:57] maybe fully decided in your heart that
[1:00:00] you haven't truly give your heart to God
[1:00:02] May today be the day
[1:00:05] amen now we realize today that we're
[1:00:08] raised for this
[1:00:10] moment 6,000 years of time has went by
[1:00:13] and seasons has went by and Prophets has
[1:00:16] stood on the scene and spoke in their
[1:00:18] season and their time and under the
[1:00:21] inspiration of the anointing of those
[1:00:23] Messengers there was a people that were
[1:00:26] gathered to overcome whether it was Old
[1:00:29] Testament or even New Testament Luther
[1:00:32] in his age men of God raised to preach
[1:00:36] the message of the hour that the just
[1:00:39] shall live by faith and we don't have to
[1:00:41] pray to Saints and we don't have to pay
[1:00:44] for prayers and buy candles and we don't
[1:00:47] have to be a part of tradition but God
[1:00:50] is justifying
[1:00:53] usen thank you Lord and what a rival
[1:00:56] that sent forth Wars begin to
[1:01:01] happen incredible Wars begin to happen
[1:01:04] when all that took place and we realize
[1:01:07] that it goes from from one dispensation
[1:01:10] to another dispensation and as our
[1:01:12] Prophet would stand there and pick out
[1:01:14] the messengers he didn't do it but under
[1:01:18] the word of God picked out the
[1:01:20] messengers of the day that God used that
[1:01:24] the angels of God was with with them it
[1:01:27] wasn't just the messenger but it was men
[1:01:30] under them that would preach and then
[1:01:32] people under there that would catch the
[1:01:35] revelation of the
[1:01:37] hour and would
[1:01:41] overcome you're that kind of a
[1:01:46] people you Lord God just didn't handpick
[1:01:49] brother Brandon to be the messenger of
[1:01:51] the age and and anointing just to send
[1:01:53] forth a message and then that be it
[1:01:58] but he raised up men of God with an
[1:02:00] inspiration to take this
[1:02:03] message every one of them diversely
[1:02:06] gifted no man like another we don't want
[1:02:08] to copy each other and neither are we in
[1:02:11] a
[1:02:13] competition we're not raising kingdoms
[1:02:16] up we're not trying to outdo
[1:02:21] anybody are you with me we are we're
[1:02:24] here to preach the message
[1:02:27] and if I could say it right and this may
[1:02:29] be against the law in the state of
[1:02:30] Virginia if I'm going to bait for
[1:02:36] deer
[1:02:39] if I'm going to bait for deer I put out
[1:02:43] things that deer will
[1:02:47] eat so we're message
[1:02:51] Believers and we're commissioned to
[1:02:54] preach Eagle food amen
[1:02:56] that Eagles will gather to and eat the
[1:02:59] message of the
[1:03:01] hour now we realize as this message is a
[1:03:04] vision and it's a it's a message that is
[1:03:07] of restoration and it's also preparing
[1:03:09] us with the wedding garment for the
[1:03:11] coming of the Lord not just the coming
[1:03:13] of the Lord but resurrected saints that
[1:03:15] are being called forth and we realize
[1:03:18] that we're in a window of time that is
[1:03:21] incredibly it's a brief it's a brief
[1:03:24] opening it's a window of time brother
[1:03:26] Brown said pinch yourself pinch your
[1:03:28] conscience it'll pass right through
[1:03:32] you it'll pass right through you don't
[1:03:35] miss it and he would constantly remind
[1:03:37] us don't you miss this don't miss this
[1:03:39] don't miss
[1:03:40] this now catch this what I'm getting
[1:03:43] ready to
[1:03:45] say yes Lord are you with me now so we
[1:03:48] realize that the clock the time of the
[1:03:51] clock is intercepted with prophecy amen
[1:03:55] now we're not in a day of playing
[1:03:58] Church
[1:04:00] on we're not in a day to where we play
[1:04:03] church or entertain or or try to try to
[1:04:07] do any of those things because we
[1:04:09] realize that we have responsibility and
[1:04:12] we have a
[1:04:13] purpose that God is going to Rapture not
[1:04:16] just 90 year olds and change their
[1:04:18] bodies but there's going to be children
[1:04:22] here and we realize that you came from
[1:04:25] the Lamb's
[1:04:26] book and so it is God that has gathered
[1:04:32] you I watched Brother David run to the
[1:04:35] altar last night I I watched him just
[1:04:38] come out of his seat and run to the
[1:04:40] Altar and I thought no man can make a
[1:04:43] man do
[1:04:54] that a few months ago he would been out
[1:04:57] of his mind to to run to an altar that's
[1:05:01] right he never had that in his plans but
[1:05:04] God deposits something in
[1:05:07] you some of you that are moving out of
[1:05:10] the Amish communities let me just say
[1:05:12] this you years ago you never thought
[1:05:14] that you'd be in this stage of your
[1:05:16] journey and now you're leaving friends
[1:05:19] and family and homes and jobs and
[1:05:22] situations it isn't a man that did that
[1:05:33] it's God that has did
[1:05:36] that and let me just say this to you and
[1:05:38] any question that's in your mind if
[1:05:41] God's did it he'll be the
[1:05:43] provider he'll be the way
[1:05:50] maker
[1:05:52] Hallelujah he's in control of it all am
[1:05:55] [Applause]
[1:06:02] are you with me so we're
[1:06:05] merging we're merging the message is
[1:06:08] coming off of paper and off of tape and
[1:06:12] it's merging into events and I want to
[1:06:14] just I want to go through some of these
[1:06:16] things this morning in Revelations
[1:06:18] chapter 19 in verse 6 and I heard as if
[1:06:21] was a great voice of a multitude and a
[1:06:24] voice of many Wat and a and a voice of
[1:06:26] Mighty thundering saying
[1:06:29] hallelujah notice these next words for
[1:06:32] the
[1:06:33] Lord God omnipotent reth who's in
[1:06:43] control who's in control of this and now
[1:06:47] now it comes our time it's an emotional
[1:06:49] scripture let us be glad and rejoice
[1:06:53] amen and give honor to him
[1:06:56] for the marriage of the Lamb has
[1:06:59] come and his
[1:07:04] wife you're a part of the many membered
[1:07:07] bride around the world and his wife has
[1:07:11] made herself
[1:07:15] ready and to her was granted that she
[1:07:17] should be ar raay and fine linen clean
[1:07:20] and white for the fine linen is the
[1:07:22] righteousness of the Saints and he said
[1:07:25] to me
[1:07:26] WR blessed are they which are called to
[1:07:31] the married supper of the lamb and he
[1:07:34] saith unto me John standing there with
[1:07:38] him these are the true sayings of
[1:07:42] God he spoke it then he made sure his
[1:07:46] messenger brother Jim was paying
[1:07:50] attention and he amened his own words
[1:07:56] that's right 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse
[1:08:01] 1 but are the times in Seasons Brethren
[1:08:04] you have no need that I write unto you
[1:08:07] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[1:08:09] day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in
[1:08:11] the
[1:08:15] night and when they shall say peace and
[1:08:18] safety then sudden destruction cometh
[1:08:21] upon them as travail upon a woman with
[1:08:24] child and they shall not
[1:08:26] Escape but ye Brethren I want you to be
[1:08:29] really attentive right now are not in
[1:08:33] darkness that that day should overtake
[1:08:35] you as a
[1:08:38] thief you're all the children of of
[1:08:40] light and the children of the day you're
[1:08:44] not of the night nor of the darkness lay
[1:08:47] out of sea is just full of
[1:08:49] Darkness every age has an allotment of
[1:08:52] darkness and every Overcomer had to say
[1:08:54] I'm not a the
[1:08:57] darkness therefore let us not sleep as
[1:08:59] do others but let us watch and be sober
[1:09:02] and they that are sleep sleep in the
[1:09:04] night and they that are drunken are
[1:09:06] Drunken In the Night drunk on the cares
[1:09:09] of life and let us who are of the day be
[1:09:14] sober putting on the breastplate of
[1:09:16] faith and love for a helmet of salvation
[1:09:19] and hope of salvation for I love these
[1:09:22] words for God hath not appointed us to
[1:09:26] wrath Hallelujah wrath's
[1:09:30] coming wrath's happening but we're not a
[1:09:34] part of
[1:09:37] that but to obtain salvation but by our
[1:09:42] Lord Jesus
[1:09:44] Christ we all ought to shout right there
[1:09:47] brother brandom is speaking and
[1:09:49] recognizing your day in this message and
[1:09:51] he just making some comments he said the
[1:09:54] church is not recog ized her day like
[1:09:57] Israel forced back to Palestine she is
[1:10:01] going to be forced into the world ccil
[1:10:03] of churches and he says she didn't
[1:10:06] recognize her hour people come out of
[1:10:09] her be not a pakers of her sins flee
[1:10:13] flee your life or you're caught with the
[1:10:16] mark of the beast and and can't do
[1:10:19] nothing else about it he said let he
[1:10:22] said let him that's filthy be filthy Ste
[1:10:25] let him that's
[1:10:27] holy not will be holy holy now let him
[1:10:31] that's
[1:10:32] holy not a boobed haed woman she can't
[1:10:36] be now that sounds very flat but that's
[1:10:40] the scripture she dishonors her head and
[1:10:42] her head is her husband and her head is
[1:10:45] Christ so she dishonors Christ how can
[1:10:48] she be dishonorable and and not be
[1:10:51] filthy let's let's let she that she's
[1:10:56] bobbed her hair keep it let he that
[1:10:59] wears shorts keep on wearing them let he
[1:11:03] that denies the word keep on denying
[1:11:08] it it's pretty blunt in it whatever you
[1:11:11] are you
[1:11:14] are but let him that's
[1:11:17] holy be holy still let him that's
[1:11:21] righteous be righteous still let
[1:11:26] and the righteousness of the word of God
[1:11:29] the Son of God made manifest be holy
[1:11:33] still righteous
[1:11:36] still righteousness yes sir he said the
[1:11:40] church is not recognized her day like
[1:11:44] Israel back in her Promised Land she
[1:11:45] don't know how she got back there she
[1:11:48] was just automatically put there why
[1:11:51] National
[1:11:54] Force put put her in her place 2500
[1:11:58] years out of her
[1:12:01] place and it put her back in her place
[1:12:04] now he says I'm going to say something
[1:12:06] National Force put Israel in her
[1:12:09] Homeland National Force will put the
[1:12:13] church in the world Council of churches
[1:12:16] but the power of God will put the people
[1:12:20] in The
[1:12:24] Bride the world forces this way and the
[1:12:27] world forces that way but God forces
[1:12:30] upward the spirit of God which is the
[1:12:33] word of God my word is spirit and life
[1:12:37] will put the bride in her place she'll
[1:12:40] recognize her position in the word then
[1:12:44] she's in Christ will put her in her
[1:12:47] place listen when you hear those words
[1:12:50] you can't miss
[1:12:53] it oh I'm just hanging on let me just
[1:12:56] say you're not hanging
[1:12:59] on you'd give up if you could the
[1:13:03] pressure would be too great but just
[1:13:05] when you feel like giving up there's
[1:13:08] another
[1:13:10] Power there's another Spirit that's
[1:13:14] hanging on to
[1:13:23] you not just to hang on to see if he if
[1:13:27] he can do it he's got a
[1:13:31] purpose he's got a purpose in doing
[1:13:43] it no naal no Forest will do it but the
[1:13:47] National Force will drive Israel to her
[1:13:51] Homeland National forces of the Council
[1:13:54] of churches will drive every
[1:13:57] organization into it but the power of
[1:14:01] God will raise the bride into
[1:14:09] Glory out of
[1:14:14] it sometimes we need to ask oursel where
[1:14:16] are we
[1:14:18] at brother B ask a question I'm sorry I
[1:14:21] just want to lay a few things down here
[1:14:22] in God of his evil age
[1:14:25] and just the things that you have saw in
[1:14:27] the last
[1:14:28] months taking place I want to just speak
[1:14:32] about some of those things for a few
[1:14:36] moments and he asked an incredible
[1:14:39] question has God lost
[1:14:46] control or is he just permitting another
[1:14:49] agency to
[1:14:52] control I wonder
[1:14:55] the true answer to this question is to
[1:14:57] my opinion I'll take his
[1:15:00] opinion there is two opposing
[1:15:05] spirits in the world today at
[1:15:09] work now there can't be more than two
[1:15:12] two
[1:15:13] heads one of them is the holy spirit at
[1:15:18] work and the other is the spirit of the
[1:15:22] devil in these last days in
[1:15:26] deceptions two Spirits one of them's
[1:15:30] God's Holy Spirit and the other's the
[1:15:32] devil Spirit can we
[1:15:36] agree working in deception and he makes
[1:15:40] these words the people of the earth now
[1:15:44] remember who he is he's a
[1:15:48] messenger he's God's voice to this
[1:15:52] generation now listen
[1:15:55] not everybody accepted him but he
[1:15:58] delivered the
[1:16:02] male well I don't believe he's Elijah he
[1:16:05] still delivered the
[1:16:07] male well I don't believe he met an
[1:16:09] angel he met an
[1:16:11] angel well I don't believe the Seven
[1:16:13] Seals it was a Seven Seals I don't
[1:16:17] believe the book's open it's
[1:16:21] open as a matter of fact it don't
[1:16:23] believe what you don't believe
[1:16:26] there's a people that'll hear the
[1:16:28] word and become the
[1:16:31] word and brother Bram said the people of
[1:16:33] the Earth are now making their
[1:16:42] choice people walk into a a
[1:16:45] booth and they click they make a they
[1:16:48] make
[1:16:48] a they make a a a a check and then they
[1:16:53] confirm
[1:16:55] and they've now voted their
[1:16:58] vote
[1:17:00] for an
[1:17:02] office whether it be the local man or or
[1:17:06] the president of the United
[1:17:08] States and you think well I made a
[1:17:10] choice well let me let me just say if we
[1:17:13] can go way higher than
[1:17:14] Humanity God causes men to
[1:17:20] rise and he causes men to
[1:17:23] fall he raised Kings and he raises
[1:17:29] presidents he he raises men up these men
[1:17:33] are going to fulfill
[1:17:38] purposes they're going to fulfill
[1:17:40] purposes just like you're going to
[1:17:42] fulfill
[1:17:43] purposes whether you know it or not in
[1:17:45] the last few presidential elections
[1:17:48] we've watched Sodom get her full
[1:17:53] freedom I think we we all should agree
[1:17:55] I'm not asking you if you're democrat or
[1:17:58] republican God callused men to he
[1:18:00] actually caused men to open the
[1:18:05] gates they literally open the
[1:18:09] gates they've opened the
[1:18:12] borders they've literally opened the
[1:18:14] borders and Spirits from every realm of
[1:18:17] hell has been loosed on the earth the
[1:18:22] very the very top of hell has been
[1:18:24] opened
[1:18:26] up every
[1:18:30] Spirit has been loosed on the
[1:18:34] earth people don't know whether they're
[1:18:36] a cat or dog or they're male or a female
[1:18:50] or but the scripture says these things
[1:18:55] must
[1:19:02] be now brother brand makes a statement I
[1:19:05] think is very
[1:19:06] powerful he says God's
[1:19:10] purpose can never be
[1:19:16] defeated now you're a solid group of
[1:19:18] people some of you are newer but I'm
[1:19:20] finding you newer people are F grabbing
[1:19:23] this message with all your heart
[1:19:24] Hallelujah I want to say this to you
[1:19:27] God's
[1:19:29] purpose can never be
[1:19:40] defeated he goes down in that paragraph
[1:19:44] what God has imagined in his
[1:19:47] mind what God has purposed in his heart
[1:19:51] to bring to pass there is no d
[1:19:56] there's no power there is nothing can
[1:19:59] ever separate God's Great Immortal in
[1:20:04] Eternal
[1:20:05] plan and it must be as God has
[1:20:11] said so let's just go back how did you
[1:20:14] get here
[1:20:17] David how did you guys get here God's
[1:20:20] Got A Plan

[1:20:27] stop you along the way and discourage
[1:20:30] you along the way how did you get here
[1:20:33] God's Got A
[1:20:44] Plan Chester how did you arrive here
[1:20:47] God's Got A

[1:20:52] board or chess and moving King and
[1:20:54] knights and PS and
[1:20:57] Bishops he's got a plan on this
[1:21:01] Earth and yes the devil is the king of
[1:21:04] this Earth but God's
[1:21:07] [Applause]
[1:21:23] greater and I want to say this with all
[1:21:25] the strength that I've got in me his
[1:21:28] seat will not be
[1:21:32] destroyed his
[1:21:35] seed his seed will not be
[1:21:43] destroyed Glory
[1:22:07] he has a purpose in your
[1:22:10] life each
[1:22:13] individual that no one else on the face
[1:22:17] of the
[1:22:18] Earth can take your place
[1:22:24] that's how important you
[1:22:27] are no one else on the earth and I don't
[1:22:33] care what their book says that they
[1:22:37] are I don't care how many initials are
[1:22:40] after their
[1:22:42] name I don't care how much money they
[1:22:46] make God chose you before there was
[1:22:50] money he chose you before there was
[1:22:52] Kings he chose you before there were
[1:22:58] churches and what he deposited on the
[1:23:01] inside of you he will not
[1:23:05] [Applause]
[1:23:09] lose and let me just let me just back it
[1:23:11] up with his own word I'll not lose a one
[1:23:17] [Applause]
[1:23:27] brother Ron go through some difficult
[1:23:30] times brother Bram reads a PO must I be
[1:23:34] carried home to heaven on a flowery bed
[1:23:36] of
[1:23:37] East While others fought to win the
[1:23:40] prize and sail through bloody
[1:23:43] seas and he says this he says I must
[1:23:47] fight if I must
[1:23:50] Reign increase my courage amen Lord
[1:23:56] now if we begin to think about how we
[1:23:59] got here the Book of Revelation she
[1:24:02] makes two
[1:24:03] statements that stands out to me this
[1:24:07] morning
[1:24:08] come and
[1:24:14] see I don't know what's going on at your
[1:24:16] church come and
[1:24:22] see John was standing there and the
[1:24:26] angel was telling him come and see now
[1:24:29] first of all you can't come if you don't
[1:24:31] have an
[1:24:38] invitation you go to a
[1:24:40] wedding there's a lot of weddings
[1:24:42] happening this
[1:24:44] year you know you just don't
[1:24:46] nonchalantly go well I think I'll go no
[1:24:50] no it's an order there's an order to it
[1:24:53] yeah you have to have an invitation well
[1:24:56] that's rude they excluded
[1:24:59] me no they can't hand a certain amount
[1:25:03] of
[1:25:07] people and they sat down and thought
[1:25:09] well who's important to me and I know
[1:25:11] there's going to be people going to be
[1:25:13] offended but I'm going to invite a 100
[1:25:15] people and these are the 100 people I'm
[1:25:17] going to invite I've never got mad over
[1:25:19] that
[1:25:24] but when you get an invitation you're
[1:25:28] invited and when you get invited you you
[1:25:31] now have a responsibility not show up in
[1:25:33] your bib overh
[1:25:36] house so if you're going to believe the
[1:25:39] message you got to get
[1:25:51] dressed there's another statement that
[1:25:53] says come up here
[1:25:56] you can jump until you're blue in the
[1:25:58] face and can't raise yourself to another
[1:26:00] realm but it's God that reaches down to
[1:26:05] you and opens the eyes of your
[1:26:09] understanding and he says come up here
[1:26:11] there I'll show you the Lamb's
[1:26:17] wife when John saw his name in the book
[1:26:20] All Of Heaven heard it the underneath
[1:26:22] Earth heard it he got
[1:26:26] emotional when he saw himself in the
[1:26:29] word that's what causes you to get such
[1:26:32] a
[1:26:35] stimulation it's more than job and Jonah
[1:26:38] and Jeremiah and David but now you see
[1:26:42] yourself in the opening of the word
[1:26:56] no you're not going to see it all the
[1:26:57] first
[1:27:00] day now it's it's kind of like eating an
[1:27:09] elephant if you're going to eat a whole
[1:27:10] elephant you're going to do it one bite
[1:27:13] at a
[1:27:18] time you're not going to understand
[1:27:21] everything in a day
[1:27:25] this is not like your new body where you
[1:27:26] change into and then you see it all
[1:27:29] you're still
[1:27:32] flesh and so there's some things about
[1:27:34] forgiveness you're not going to really
[1:27:36] understand until life begins to
[1:27:41] happen things about cleansing your
[1:27:43] spirit and keeping your spirit clean
[1:27:46] when the enemy tries to contaminate it
[1:27:48] you're going to understand as you walk
[1:27:50] with
[1:27:51] him right
[1:27:54] thank you Lord how to conduct yourself
[1:27:57] as the Lamb's wife because there's a
[1:28:01] protocol cuz you're the Queen of Heaven
[1:28:03] you're not one of the frilly little
[1:28:05] girls you're the Queen of
[1:28:07] Heaven you're the
[1:28:12] Ester you got to understand your your
[1:28:15] place and you got to understand that it
[1:28:17] comes with
[1:28:19] authority oh I wish I had time to
[1:28:22] preach you you got to understand you're
[1:28:25] just not a
[1:28:26] [Applause]
[1:28:29] church you just don't have a
[1:28:35] program are you with me now I no longer
[1:28:39] call you
[1:28:40] church I call you
[1:28:50] bride and as you go along you realize
[1:28:53] that you're full fulfilling a
[1:28:56] vision that you didn't see about
[1:28:58] yourself but God saw about you and you
[1:29:01] begin to walk and you begin to surrender
[1:29:04] your life to it you begin to walk and
[1:29:07] you begin to enjoy life and and when you
[1:29:09] look back you can see the perfect work
[1:29:11] will of
[1:29:12] God sometimes you can't see it in front
[1:29:15] of you but you can look back and see
[1:29:18] that you've been walking with him all
[1:29:20] the time
[1:29:25] now God wants to interpret his word in
[1:29:29] your
[1:29:31] life he's got a vision for you now we
[1:29:35] get glimpses we get glimpses of Heaven
[1:29:38] We Begin to realize our true value of
[1:29:41] how important that we
[1:29:43] are you're worth 10 million worlds
[1:29:51] am now I want to drop something right
[1:29:53] here here now you're worth 10 million
[1:29:57] Worlds the person beside of you is also
[1:30:00] worth 10 million
[1:30:06] Worlds the quicker you can understand
[1:30:09] that the more respect you will have for
[1:30:12] one
[1:30:15] another go ahead and Shout right there
[1:30:32] so as a Ministry I have to understand
[1:30:36] I'm not here to beat
[1:30:41] you God won't
[1:30:43] let me be your Holy
[1:30:47] Ghost that's
[1:30:50] right and I'm not going to be nosy in
[1:30:52] your business amen but neither do I want
[1:30:56] you nosy in
[1:31:07] mine brother Ron should I should I buy a
[1:31:09] red car should I buy a Corvette oh
[1:31:17] yeah Jordan I wish I had a hundred of
[1:31:20] you
[1:31:27] should I buy this house should
[1:31:30] I I'm not your holy
[1:31:33] ghosten I will pray with you I will pray
[1:31:37] with you but I'm not your Holy
[1:31:50] Ghost now not only is God dealing with
[1:31:55] you as a gentile
[1:31:57] bride but he's also Gathering a people
[1:32:01] and instill in operation that he's
[1:32:03] getting ready to turn from from
[1:32:08] Gentile to
[1:32:11] Jew well brother Ron can you give me
[1:32:14] some idea of what is going on in the
[1:32:18] earth in the past months
[1:32:26] he is turning from Gentile to
[1:32:33] Jew which means it's time for you to go
[1:32:44] home but listen the spirits
[1:32:48] overlap and you are seeing
[1:32:52] pre-tribulation a
[1:32:54] anointing that is on the Earth today
[1:32:58] there I'm going to say some strong
[1:33:00] things now there's not a
[1:33:02] president or one in front of us that can
[1:33:07] stop the wheels of
[1:33:12] Prophecy or the spirit that has been
[1:33:16] Unleashed there's been a war since the
[1:33:19] beginning of
[1:33:21] time in the middle
[1:33:24] least Israel will have to fight till the
[1:33:27] last day for her
[1:33:32] boundaries and Nations will rise against
[1:33:35] her with not just a sentiment to take a
[1:33:38] couple hundred yards back but they want
[1:33:41] to drive her into the
[1:33:44] sea they want to destroy her they did it
[1:33:47] in
[1:33:49] Egypt they did it when Jesus was here
[1:33:56] and listen Hitler did his best to kill
[1:33:59] every one of them that he could but God
[1:34:02] preserves his
[1:34:06] seed and I want to say this you I don't
[1:34:09] care what your political s situation is
[1:34:12] Israel will not lose
[1:34:24] now I may get in trouble with the next
[1:34:26] two minutes but let me just say this to
[1:34:28] you don't get your flags out about the
[1:34:31] Palestinians they're Canon
[1:34:36] father they're Canon
[1:34:39] father but a lot of other nations are
[1:34:42] Canon
[1:34:44] father and the spirit that's
[1:34:49] anointing against the Jews in America
[1:34:52] and all over the world
[1:34:54] is preparing for for the final
[1:35:06] battle and I would just say this to you
[1:35:08] if I was the president everybody just
[1:35:11] doing all of
[1:35:12] that all of that nonsense that they're
[1:35:15] doing and send them over there to
[1:35:21] Palestine just send them over there
[1:35:31] brother Ron that's pretty strong in the
[1:35:33] same sentence that they're hating the
[1:35:34] Jews they're hating
[1:35:37] Americans that's
[1:35:39] right and if you're not listening you
[1:35:42] you you got to wake
[1:35:43] up because all of these signs is telling
[1:35:47] us listen it's not a flesh and blood
[1:35:52] Affair it's it's not a flesh and blood
[1:35:54] Affair you know you can just make a
[1:35:57] couple mentions and you can feel the
[1:36:00] heat why because we're getting ready to
[1:36:05] leave and just as much as Israel is
[1:36:08] having to fight for her boundaries the
[1:36:10] Bride of Jesus Christ is having to fight
[1:36:12] for
[1:36:14] hers listen I'm not ashamed of the
[1:36:16] Gospel of Jesus Christ I will not back
[1:36:20] up I will not turn around
[1:36:24] I will not take my banner down I believe
[1:36:27] this message with all of my heart this
[1:36:31] message has prepared
