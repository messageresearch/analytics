[50:17] today it's telling me my Apple pencil's
[50:21] low I don't know what that means
[50:25] but
[50:28] this has been one of the
[50:31] greatest
[50:34] weeks
[50:36] amen there was a man of God called
[50:39] Edward
[50:40] bcll that preached a message one day and
[50:44] a young man was sitting in an audience
[50:46] and God saved amen and that's your
[50:52] pastor the tie goes a long ways doesn't
[50:55] it brother Ry TI goes a long long
[51:00] way and by the grace of God when I first
[51:03] met brother Ron I said how come the Lord
[51:06] had held you back from me all my life
[51:10] amen but I think we tried to catch up do
[51:13] some catch up over the years we've been
[51:16] able I've been the blessed man to be
[51:18] able to travel with brother Ron
[51:21] Spencer and blessed by his ministry and
[51:24] his life and his love and his friendship
[51:27] we've been overseas together and we
[51:29] shared meetings together and they've
[51:31] impacted my life and they still impact
[51:34] my
[51:37] life I just I mean there is so much in
[51:41] our
[51:43] family and I'm you you see my son
[51:47] Sam and uh you can go right along down
[51:52] to Michael go Sam Michael and and our
[51:56] baby is is
[52:01] Joel and
[52:05] um one year we were blessed to have the
[52:09] whole Spencer family up to our way so we
[52:13] sort of felt we needed to reciprocate so
[52:16] when I told brother Ron and sister
[52:17] Connie that we were going to come up
[52:20] they said how many I said all of
[52:24] them
[52:25] Payback
[52:30] pay
[52:31] back and so we were blessed to have them
[52:35] and you know after after um I just want
[52:38] to bring this one up because uh I love
[52:42] brother Andrew amen um he's a part of my
[52:46] life if I get to
[52:50] heaven I get a little bit of a
[52:54] reward amen and you know we don't look
[52:58] for rewards but brother BR said you
[53:00] don't preach on rewards enough but there
[53:02] is rewards you
[53:04] know and I had the privilege of being
[53:09] with Andrew we are out after camp and
[53:13] um I'll slow down brother Ron is okay
[53:16] just want
[53:19] to brother Ron had a terrible accident
[53:24] as you I'm telling you
[53:27] you and um brother Matthew you're a hero
[53:31] to
[53:33] me
[53:35] hero saved
[53:39] him and brother bcll we had bought in a
[53:43] we call it a Bible Camp our family camp
[53:46] we have a little bit of a 40 some odat
[53:49] acre Wilderness Camp up at Mount Baker
[53:52] and and uh we just purchased it brother
[53:55] Ron was going through a a terrible
[53:57] time and brother
[54:00] bcll um he phoned you right sister
[54:04] Connie and he said to Sister Connie and
[54:06] brother Ron was at a state I think
[54:08] probably the lowest part and they were
[54:11] thinking of
[54:13] harvesting is that right I don't want to
[54:15] say anything out a
[54:17] turn and that's where the headp space
[54:19] was where they were going and brother
[54:22] bcll says to Sister Connie he says you
[54:25] whisper her you talk he said the last
[54:28] thing that goes is the hearing you tell
[54:31] brother
[54:32] Ron he's going to take our first family
[54:37] bible
[54:38] camp when it looked
[54:41] impossible that's when the Holy Spirit
[54:44] started to move and brother Ron Spencer
[54:48] was our first bible speaker God bless
[54:52] you brother
[54:55] Ron
[55:04] but that had to
[55:06] be it had to be brother Ron Brother
[55:10] roll had known of course Joel is that
[55:14] all right can
[55:16] I Joel wasn't in what we call the a good
[55:21] spot and uh we are
[55:24] so burdened for him and
[55:29] um we we'd ask him would you just come
[55:32] to service just would you come to
[55:34] service brother Ron Spencer is going to
[55:36] come and preach at our service and
[55:39] brother Ron preached a masterpiece it
[55:41] was their first service it should have
[55:42] been the last service but it was the
[55:44] first service and the whole church like
[55:47] this
[55:48] just moved up to the altar I'm sitting
[55:51] probably where Michael is sitting and
[55:55] and uh Jo and the organ would have been
[55:57] closer over here and and the whole move
[56:00] of God was gone and I thought I looked
[56:02] for Joel and his chair was empty and I
[56:05] go you can't have
[56:09] gone you can't have
[56:13] gone
[56:14] Lord you can't have left the
[56:19] service so it was a long after service
[56:22] people praying and I'm praying with a
[56:24] whole pile of people over here and other
[56:27] brothers are praying for over here he
[56:28] just can't see over here and I finally
[56:31] get to sit down and look at
[56:38] Joan where's
[56:41] Joel where's
[56:44] Joel she said he's right
[56:47] here he was one of the first that came
[56:49] up to the
[56:51] front so God works a mysterious ways
[56:57] God tried to take your pastor off the
[56:59] scene and Satan knew that he could get
[57:02] him he'd get my
[57:04] son and God had to raise brother Ron up
[57:07] for my
[57:10] son and so Joel gave his heart to the
[57:13] Lord and and we had a mini camp go to
[57:17] Victoria I think all the suspencers and
[57:20] the frasers and whoever we were all over
[57:23] at this Victorious Vancouver Island it's
[57:25] a huge Island they think an you think an
[57:27] island well it's 475 Miles by what 80
[57:31] miles 100 miles I don't know it's big
[57:34] place and so we're all over there and
[57:36] we're all walking down the street look
[57:38] like a little crowd just moving like
[57:40] a bees just everybody talking and
[57:45] fellowshipping and
[57:47] uh you know it's wonderful to see when
[57:52] Believers love each other and they're
[57:54] talking about word brother Andrew and I
[57:57] saw us linger
[57:59] behind we lingered a little bit
[58:03] behind and he's got his arm around me of
[58:06] course everybody's taller than me
[58:08] anyway and he's walking with me and he
[58:11] says Hey Brother Tom he said I heard you
[58:14] were a great
[58:17] golfer and I
[58:19] go no I wasn't a great
[58:22] golfer in my in my second life the other
[58:25] life
[58:26] well not this life my other life before
[58:29] I got saved our family was sort of that
[58:32] type of people and
[58:36] um he said no I heard you're a very
[58:38] great golfer I said no no Andrew no I
[58:43] said I was a good
[58:44] golfer I I I I I enjoyed it I I liked it
[58:48] a lot you know our Pro was a very good
[58:51] friend of ours and was thinking maybe my
[58:54] brother and myself would do more than
[58:56] what we did and uh I said but I I'm only
[58:59] a good golfer I said a great golfer and
[59:02] we're just talking like this and we're
[59:05] walking on the street just coming on
[59:07] over the curb now going through a
[59:09] sidewalk to the other
[59:11] side I said I'm not a good wasn't a
[59:14] great golfer I was only good a great
[59:18] golfer has a heart for
[59:21] it that's what greatness you got a gift
[59:26] of it and you got to have a heart for it
[59:30] amen I said I might have a little bit of
[59:32] a gift to play
[59:35] it I said but my heart as a little boy
[59:39] even though my parents were unbelievers
[59:41] did not even go to church as a
[59:44] 5-year-old boy four-year-old boy I told
[59:47] my parents when I grow up I'm going to
[59:49] be a
[59:51] preacher so as soon as I said to brother
[59:55] Andrew
[59:56] I said my heart was always for the Lord
[1:00:03] and the Holy
[1:00:05] Spirit brother Andrew isn't it TR is it
[1:00:10] true he fell right there in the middle
[1:00:14] of a
[1:00:16] road he said brother
[1:00:19] Tom he said I have not told anybody this
[1:00:23] so he told me some personal things and
[1:00:26] he saysi not
[1:00:29] saved I said you can
[1:00:32] be right
[1:00:34] here right now in this very spot and
[1:00:40] every time I go over there brother
[1:00:42] Andrew I look at that
[1:00:44] spot I think that's where Andrew Spencer
[1:00:48] got saved by the glory of God and to
[1:00:52] that I give him all the praise God bless
[1:00:55] you
[1:01:04] brother so the Lord by God's grace use

[1:04:07] meal our table is getting so
[1:04:11] long and I think it's getting longer I
[1:04:14] don't know I won't prophesy
[1:04:17] anything but thank you for opening your
[1:04:20] hearts Michael
[1:04:22] Masterpiece it was a masterpiece
[1:04:33] brother Ron came I know I I don't know
[1:04:36] what you hear what what's been told you
[1:04:39] I'm sure it's
[1:04:40] everything and I'm not adding anything
[1:04:43] or taking away but brother Ron flew in
[1:04:46] one time for our camp seven years ago
[1:04:49] coming up seven years he said brother
[1:04:51] Tom I got two things on my
[1:04:53] heart and one is your son
[1:04:57] and he says ' I don't want you to say
[1:04:58] anything I said my lips are
[1:05:00] sealed and when brother Ron called for a
[1:05:03] pray meeting or prayer line it was a
[1:05:05] prayer meeting already right prayer line
[1:05:08] he turned to me I don't know where I
[1:05:11] know you see more than me because I'm
[1:05:14] just one of those one born under de
[1:05:17] season I guess in your life and uh
[1:05:22] brother Ron turned and looked at me and
[1:05:23] I go whoa okay
[1:05:26] his eyes were
[1:05:28] different and I'm standing right there
[1:05:30] and he says call Michael I go call
[1:05:33] Michael call Michael call Michael we
[1:05:36] called
[1:05:37] Michael and Michael came
[1:05:40] up and brother
[1:05:42] Ron said to him
[1:05:45] um I you're called to the ministry or
[1:05:48] whatever was said and and brother Ron
[1:05:50] was rehearsing to me yesterday he said
[1:05:52] the first words out of Michael's lips
[1:05:54] was no
[1:05:59] oh he grew up in a preacher's
[1:06:04] home and then of course he said well if
[1:06:07] the Lord called me he's going to call my
[1:06:10] wife and that bigel God bless you dear
[1:06:14] he called you both Amen to a great
[1:06:19] calling great calling after I watched
[1:06:22] him last night I understand something
[1:06:25] more
[1:06:27] real I'm not I'm not Leonardo D
[1:06:31] viny don't get it on he had a longer
[1:06:35] beard and Michael's not Michelangelo but
[1:06:38] pretty
[1:06:40] close but there's a story that goes when
[1:06:43] um the Vatican and everything was to be
[1:06:46] built there was only two
[1:06:50] artists that uh they wanted to choose
[1:06:53] between the old old
[1:06:57] Leonardo or the young
[1:07:01] Michelangelo I figured they chose the
[1:07:04] right they took
[1:07:06] Michelangelo and the reason why I think
[1:07:09] now I understand Leonardo took 16 years
[1:07:14] to paint the Mona
[1:07:16] Lisa and if he was going to paint the
[1:07:19] 16th chapel he'd still be
[1:07:23] painting so they wanted youth
[1:07:26] and
[1:07:27] quickness and I'm just so proud to see
[1:07:30] what God has done to
[1:07:33] vindicate what God put on your pastor's
[1:07:35] heart amen you again saw another
[1:07:39] Vindication of the word going
[1:07:42] forth and so you understand why we love
[1:07:45] him so
[1:07:47] much yes we do and I know you do and I
[1:07:52] know there's a whole pile more people
[1:07:53] around the world do
[1:07:56] but God bless
[1:07:57] you God bless you for holding your
[1:08:00] pastor brother Andrew up this church as
[1:08:04] Michael said last night has been a
[1:08:06] lighthouse around the
[1:08:07] world you know you think you're
[1:08:10] sometimes you feel low and you feel that
[1:08:12] you're a nobody but without you we
[1:08:15] wouldn't be preaching without you there
[1:08:17] would be no church without you we'd have
[1:08:19] no Ministry you're an integral part of
[1:08:24] the body of Christ and your lives have
[1:08:27] blessed the Saints around the world and
[1:08:32] I applaud
[1:08:44] you God bless you
[1:08:47] Pastor brother
[1:08:50] Andrew God bless his
[1:08:52] church is that is okay amen somebody say
[1:08:58] no we be all
[1:09:00] right you wonder my feeling but I just
[1:09:04] thought you know um we now what we've
[1:09:08] just and of course there's just
[1:09:10] more and the and and God is mysterious
[1:09:14] in his ways and his wonders to perform
[1:09:17] and and God has has brought can you
[1:09:20] imagine to you know Canada in the far
[1:09:24] left corner all the way to Virginia
[1:09:28] Jenny it's just
[1:09:30] amazing and I I I look at it as nothing
[1:09:33] but God and how God put it all together
[1:09:37] is the greatness of God and so without
[1:09:40] any further delay I'm sorry it's 10
[1:09:43] after 12 I'll try and be as concise as
[1:09:46] possible I know we'll be out by
[1:09:49] 3 that's my
[1:09:54] conciseness
[1:09:56] amen no it will be sooner than that
[1:09:59] don't you worry don't you worry let's
[1:10:01] stand please to our
[1:10:06] feet I've got a little uh thought of
[1:10:10] course as you pray and study things open
[1:10:14] as all the ministers know that and and
[1:10:17] it just keeps all all unfolding but you
[1:10:19] have to try and keep focus
[1:10:22] focus and I'm just believing today that
[1:10:25] God has something special for someone
[1:10:29] amen and sister Nancy I didn't see you
[1:10:32] hiding back there God bless you Sister
[1:10:34] Nancy you mean a lot to us your picture

[1:10:52] specific it's direct it's it's
[1:10:56] personal and I'm going to um look at a
[1:11:01] little little spot here in the scripture
[1:11:05] and and I'm just maybe do a little bit
[1:11:07] of a turn but just stay with me I'm
[1:11:10] Leonardo da Vinci I'm the old guy not
[1:11:14] that I'm Leonardo I'm just the old guy
[1:11:17] so let's turn please into the word of
[1:11:20] God to Luke chapter
[1:11:24] 5
[1:11:27] I haven't spoken on
[1:11:29] this so help me preach as brother Tim
[1:11:33] puit says I like that help me
[1:11:40] preach I love brother Tim
[1:11:44] amen you know what it's amazing how God
[1:11:48] puts friends in your life and they're so
[1:11:50] far
[1:11:52] apart
[1:11:54] far
[1:11:56] but you know sometimes you just get on
[1:11:57] the telephone you talk to one another
[1:11:59] maybe not in 3 months or whatever and
[1:12:01] it's just like you just caught right up
[1:12:03] it's instant and just think what
[1:12:06] heaven's going to be like when we all
[1:12:08] catch up Thomas all together and be be
[1:12:13] one amen Luke did I say Luke
[1:12:16] 5 verse 17
[1:12:23] please and it came to pass
[1:12:26] on a certain day as he was teaching that
[1:12:30] there were Pharisees and doctors of the
[1:12:32] law sitting by I want you to notice that
[1:12:37] it says
[1:12:39] specifically they were just sitting
[1:12:43] by so that's we'll just take our time
[1:12:47] and it came to pass on a certain day he
[1:12:49] was
[1:12:50] teaching that there were Pharisees and
[1:12:53] doctors of the law sitting by which were
[1:12:58] come out of every town of
[1:13:00] Galilee Judah Judea
[1:13:04] Jerusalem the power of the Lord was
[1:13:06] present to heal
[1:13:09] them and behold men brought in a bed a
[1:13:14] man which was taken with the
[1:13:18] py and they sought means to bring him
[1:13:22] in and to lay him before
[1:13:26] him and when they could not find by what
[1:13:30] way they might bring him in because of
[1:13:33] the multitude they went up upon the
[1:13:36] Housetop and let him down through the
[1:13:40] tiling with his couch in the midst
[1:13:45] before
[1:13:46] Jesus and when he saw their faith he
[1:13:49] said unto him
[1:13:51] man thy sins are
[1:13:55] forgiven thee a't that amazing and the
[1:14:00] scribes and the Pharisees began to
[1:14:02] reason why they were just sitting
[1:14:05] by they weren't participants here they
[1:14:08] were just sitting
[1:14:11] by and we don't come to church to sit
[1:14:16] by all right so we didn't come to this
[1:14:19] little service this morning and say well
[1:14:21] we haven't seen brother Tom and we heard
[1:14:24] about him he's short and white haired
[1:14:26] and old and whatever and I'm just going
[1:14:30] to sit and see what he's got to say we
[1:14:33] don't sit
[1:14:35] by we have a chore to do that is the
[1:14:41] Beat the Devil down come on and live a
[1:14:45] life worthy of the Gospel of Jesus

[1:14:56] yes so who do you identify with the
[1:14:58] sitter biters or the tile

[1:15:03] Wreckers and I just thought I might
[1:15:05] title it tile
[1:15:07] Wreckers amen we need to break some
[1:15:10] tiles around here let's get into the
[1:15:13] presence of the Lord where Miracles are
[1:15:16] happening the Supernatural is

[1:15:36] have beli and and persuaded that he's
[1:15:38] more than able to beat any
[1:15:41] situation I don't care what it is we
[1:15:44] have seen every spectrum of the Gospel
[1:15:48] fulfilled and all we just say I want
[1:15:50] more of
[1:15:52] Jesus I'm going to be a tile wrecker

[1:16:03] get that
[1:16:04] word I said well I it's a Tom Ray
[1:16:08] word so they have a dictionary started
[1:16:11] the dictionary of Tom
[1:16:17] Webster and when they saw their faith he
[1:16:19] said unto them man thy sins are forgiven
[1:16:23] thee and the scribes in the Pharisees
[1:16:25] began to reason why they're reasoning
[1:16:27] because they're sitter
[1:16:29] buyers ah you know where that type and
[1:16:33] Shadow come from or why is he tying that
[1:16:35] quote with this quote they start
[1:16:37] reasoning certain things we are saying
[1:16:39] what the prophet says we aren't adding
[1:16:43] or taking away we are saying what he
[1:16:47] says I want to title this message we are

[1:16:53] free come on on we are in the land of

[1:17:29] feedback you get quiet I'll

[1:17:46] home there's no plowing
[1:17:49] here I'm setting my wings and we're

[1:18:12] live for this these moments I live for
[1:18:16] them what's out there you tell me what's
[1:18:17] out there there is nothing out there I
[1:18:20] walked through W Washington DC I looked
[1:18:23] at people that are just a bunch of
[1:18:27] zombies they don't know where they're
[1:18:29] going and what's going Michael gets a
[1:18:31] message out of there I get a message out
[1:18:33] of there we are in the land of the
[1:18:36] free they are
[1:18:39] bound by Satan but God has come down in
[1:18:44] this generation to loose
[1:18:48] you to lift you into Heavenly
[1:18:52] places always
[1:18:55] that's what he said Heavenly places
[1:18:58] you're in Heavenly places sometimes
[1:19:01] doesn't sound like a quote to me huh you
[1:19:03] are in Heavenly places
[1:19:06] always we are in the land of the free
[1:19:09] and we're tile
[1:19:12] Wreckers we're not sitter
[1:19:14] buyers that's right amen we're getting
[1:19:17] ready to go
[1:19:18] home aren't
[1:19:20] we you're afraid I'm going to keep you
[1:19:22] standing all service uh-huh oh you're
[1:19:25] already going look at and watch I'm
[1:19:27] going to stand for five
[1:19:29] minutes he stands all the
[1:19:31] time he stands all the time we're just
[1:19:35] enjoying ourselves
[1:19:37] okay it's all right my never have me
[1:19:41] back but that's okay we'll write off
[1:19:43] into the
[1:19:45] sunset we'll rise
[1:19:47] together amen thy sins be forgiven thee
[1:19:53] and the scribes and the Pharisees began
[1:19:54] to reason saying who is this which
[1:19:57] speaketh blasphemy who can forgive sin
[1:20:01] but God Alone yes that's the point
[1:20:05] that's right that's the point they were
[1:20:08] missing God but the tile Wreckers never
[1:20:12] they knew God was in their
[1:20:14] midst amen we need to start breaking
[1:20:17] some tiles say well I got a friend and
[1:20:19] he's in his bed of infirmity and I need
[1:20:22] to get him to church yes Lord amen well
[1:20:27] I better read their scripture here but
[1:20:30] when Jesus perceived their thoughts he
[1:20:32] answered and said unto them what reason
[1:20:34] ye in your in your hearts whether it's
[1:20:37] easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee
[1:20:41] or say rise up and
[1:20:44] walk but that they may know that the son
[1:20:48] of man has power upon the Earth to
[1:20:52] forgive sin amen
[1:20:55] I say unto thee they're challenging
[1:21:00] God what is the devil
[1:21:02] thinking he's a loser in the beginning
[1:21:06] he got fallen from heaven and he's going
[1:21:09] to
[1:21:10] hell they're challenging God and so he
[1:21:14] says was it easier to say thy sins be
[1:21:18] forgiven thee or rise up and walk but
[1:21:21] that you may know that the son of man
[1:21:23] have power upon the Earth to forgive
[1:21:24] sins I say unto thee arise take up thy
[1:21:29] couch and go into thine house and
[1:21:35] immediately he arose up before them took
[1:21:39] up where in he laid and departed to his
[1:21:42] own home
[1:21:44] glorifying
[1:21:46] God Amen may the Lord add his Blessing
[1:21:49] to the reading of his word you may have
[1:21:51] your seat sorry for keeping you standing
[1:22:02] py he was afflicted of py and it's very
[1:22:05] specific doesn't say he was inflicted
[1:22:07] with an infirmity but it gives us a
[1:22:11] specific
[1:22:13] diagnosis of the
[1:22:15] situation and when God have come in this
[1:22:21] generation and used a son of man
[1:22:25] again he was very specific right of what
[1:22:30] their infirmity was it wasn't like oh I
[1:22:34] think you have a headache or you got a
[1:22:36] back pain or you've got this little
[1:22:38] problem he was very specific you've got
[1:22:41] this problem you've got that problem you
[1:22:45] got this blood pressure problem you got
[1:22:47] this kidney problem but you have it no
[1:22:52] more Hallelujah because there were
[1:22:55] people that tore off tiles to get to a
[1:22:59] service it was not
[1:23:02] convenient to get to a service some
[1:23:06] slept in cars for days we forget those
[1:23:09] days because now we have churches and we
[1:23:13] sit in a Pew but there's people that
[1:23:15] drove for hours and days and weeks to
[1:23:19] follow the son of man in this day but
[1:23:23] now it's easy we just live in a home
[1:23:26] come to a church everything's fine
[1:23:29] everything's easy but God is still
[1:23:33] specific God is still
[1:23:37] specific
[1:23:39] py it's accompanied by a
[1:23:42] weakness and a loss of feeling
[1:23:46] right so if we just don't have to look
[1:23:49] at the the natural part let's take a
[1:23:51] look at the spiritual part
[1:23:56] it's a brain
[1:23:58] disorder and it will kill
[1:24:04] you so we're not looking at a
[1:24:09] situation of some thou 2,000 years ago
[1:24:13] that we think well that was a nice story
[1:24:15] and Jesus came through this town and the
[1:24:16] Pharisees Sadducees were there and they
[1:24:19] were just sitting by we don't want to be
[1:24:22] those kind of people we don't ever want
[1:24:24] to those kind of people we want to be
[1:24:26] tile Wreckers can you imagine what was
[1:24:29] in their mind I'm going to wreck your
[1:24:31] house Andrew not my house but Jesus knew
[1:24:36] exactly what
[1:24:37] house he it wasn't it wasn't a concrete
[1:24:41] top he knew exactly the type of house he
[1:24:44] needed to be
[1:24:46] in God knew what kind of church you need
[1:24:49] to be
[1:24:50] in he knew what position he had to be in
[1:24:55] he wasn't to the right he wasn't to the
[1:24:57] left that bed came right down to
[1:25:01] him

[1:35:06] we got home Joan and I read the letter
[1:35:08] over we got down on our knees we prayed
[1:35:10] and I said honey it didn't say Tom Ray
[1:35:12] he doesn't know Tom Ray the Holy Ghost
[1:35:14] knows you and I'll tell you I hope he
[1:35:17] knows

[1:36:12] tile
[1:36:13] Ripper amen you will break
[1:36:16] through get in the presence of God and
[1:36:19] see the benefits that come down look at
[1:36:23] that rope
[1:36:26] oh just a second three years later three
[1:36:30] years later Joanne comes and says I want
[1:36:34] a baby why can't I be like other women
[1:36:38] sorry honey I know these are personal
[1:36:41] things why can't I be like other women
[1:36:44] just have
[1:36:47] babies said there's always a reason
[1:36:49] honey I'm a deacon I'm at the back of
[1:36:52] the church and the pastor P Bisal goes
[1:36:54] right by me says No prayers this
[1:36:57] morning I just told Joan we'll go to
[1:36:59] church and put in prayer brother Ed says
[1:37:03] hold the prayer
[1:37:05] request
[1:37:07] okay after after the service he or when
[1:37:10] he came to the pulpit he says you wonder
[1:37:11] why I I never took any prayer requests
[1:37:13] this morning he says because the Bible
[1:37:16] says these signs
[1:37:17] follow I want to preach the word this
[1:37:20] morning and I want to see signs
[1:37:22] following amen and so we waited till all
[1:37:25] people were prayed for and brother bisco
[1:37:27] went into the little office that he had
[1:37:29] sister Joanne was on the organ over
[1:37:31] there and I'm standing at the back and
[1:37:33] there's only two of us in the room and
[1:37:38] brother red comes out of that little
[1:37:39] door and comes to the front and says
[1:37:43] honey what would you like she said Daddy
[1:37:46] I want a
[1:37:49] baby I want a
[1:37:52] baby well you know as women go through
[1:37:55] these things and and it was that time
[1:37:58] and and brother Bisal just said let him
[1:38:03] come or let it come say it
[1:38:08] honey let life come
[1:38:12] now you want to talk about the third
[1:38:15] pull you people get all the great
[1:38:17] Mysteries of the third pole Saints we
[1:38:20] have the third pull he said just wait
[1:38:24] till the council tightens up we see it
[1:38:27] in part but when it happens then you
[1:38:30] will see it fully manifested he said let
[1:38:33] life come
[1:38:35] now there's that
[1:38:39] L benefits I'll take the
[1:38:44] benefits but not to be undone because
[1:38:46] Joel couldn't be a natural-born
[1:38:49] baby because he would feel sort of a
[1:38:52] little bit less than two Supernatural
[1:38:56] Brothers oh we're

[1:39:39] in India he's in prayer and the Holy
[1:39:42] Spirit speaks to him and says you'll
[1:39:45] have a grandson and his name will be
[1:39:49] Joel and he goes out of his room he says
[1:39:52] s Rose write this down on your calendar
[1:39:55] brother Ron you know all about that
[1:39:57] because all the people all the critics
[1:40:00] as we read about the phes they reasoned

[1:54:39] now there's a clock
[1:54:43] there you've been
[1:54:45] gracious you've been very
[1:54:48] gracious go just going a little
[1:54:51] more Al
[1:54:53] righty can you turn to Mark
[1:54:57] 5 Mark chapter
[1:55:00] 5 verse
[1:55:09] 37 oh how I love
[1:55:13] him how I adore
[1:55:18] him Mark 5: 7 37 you got it
[1:55:23] oh you got it there okay I'm wondering
[1:55:26] why are you looking over my
[1:55:28] head I know I'm short but I didn't know
[1:55:31] I was that
[1:55:32] short look at your Bibles you are okay
[1:55:36] Mark 5:37 and he suffered no man to
[1:55:39] follow him Peter James and John faith
[1:55:43] hope and charity he took with
[1:55:46] him and he come into a house of a ruler
[1:55:49] synagogue and he seeth the tumult and
[1:55:52] them that wept and wailed greetly
[1:55:55] greatly and when he came in he said unto
[1:55:58] them why make ye this Ado and why Weep
[1:56:03] the
[1:56:04] damsel read it with me
[1:56:10] is okay you got that right I'll take
[1:56:14] what Jesus
[1:56:17] said I'll take what Jesus he's got all
[1:56:20] the unbelief out of the room he brings
[1:56:22] faith hope and charity in the room now
[1:56:26] hope isn't hope
[1:56:27] Soul you got that right hope is a high
[1:56:31] expectation of fulfillment that's what
[1:56:34] the Greek means so it's not oh I hope
[1:56:36] that happens to a Believer when you hope
[1:56:39] you have an expectation of fulfillment
[1:56:42] of what you're hoping
[1:56:44] for you got that so faith hope and
[1:56:47] charity walks in with Jesus the
[1:56:50] word and they laugh asked him here's the
[1:56:54] sitter
[1:56:55] buyers here's the sitter
[1:56:58] buyers and they laughed him to
[1:57:02] scorn but when he put them all out he
[1:57:06] taketh the father and the mother of the
[1:57:09] damsel and them that were with him
[1:57:12] entered into where the damsel was
[1:57:15] lying and he took the damsel by his hand
[1:57:20] and said unto her
[1:57:22] talitha Kumi which is being
[1:57:26] interpreted
[1:57:27] damsel I say unto thee

[2:15:43] yesterday he said I all right so we're
[2:15:46] having a prayer line prayer line prayer
[2:15:48] line and brother Ron turns to me he says
[2:15:51] call Brother Caleb's
[2:15:52] wife call Brother Caleb's wife he's the
[2:15:55] pastor in Shanghai but they Outreach to
[2:15:59] Hano which is a university town which we
[2:16:02] call a town it's only got what Michael 2
[2:16:05] million yeah small town in China
[2:16:08] Shanghai is 35 million that's the size
[2:16:11] of all Canada one city so we are there
[2:16:15] and brother Ron's exhausted we just go
[2:16:17] from one meeting to another meeting to
[2:16:19] another meeting and brother Ron says to
[2:16:21] me he says brother Tom tell brother
[2:16:23] Caleb to get his
[2:16:25] wife and so brother Caleb goes gets his
[2:16:29] wife and uh I knew them before they were
[2:16:32] even married they got a seven-year-old
[2:16:34] 5-year-old boy at the time
[2:16:37] now I've never been invited to their
[2:16:39] house and I hope they don't hear this
[2:16:43] tape oh they can hear this tape cuz she
[2:16:46] got delivered anyways I had of
[2:16:48] myself we call I she's never invited and
[2:16:51] and and the Chinese custom is you have
[2:16:54] your friends over have have people over
[2:16:56] I want to be invited
[2:16:58] over how long can I
[2:17:00] stay huh so it's a it's like have tea
[2:17:04] like just have tea right so we've never
[2:17:06] been invited and so and that's a little
[2:17:10] perplexing so when brother Ron flew in
[2:17:12] two days before me I think a day maybe
[2:17:14] ahead of me and then I flew in because
[2:17:16] brother that was when brother bisell
[2:17:17] said the big boys can take care of
[2:17:18] themselves yeah
[2:17:22] sh take that
[2:17:24] off and so we made it to China anyways
[2:17:29] we're and this is ending our meetings
[2:17:31] and he says get brother Caleb's wife and
[2:17:34] I said okay but as we landed we were at
[2:17:37] the luggage pickup I said to to her I
[2:17:40] said we're coming over to your house for
[2:17:43] tea this year well I didn't know what I
[2:17:45] was saying she was freaking
[2:17:48] out she has this thing called called
[2:17:51] what's it called
[2:17:52] hun
[2:17:55] OCD
[2:17:58] bad very
[2:18:00] bad
[2:18:03] so I don't know this I just don't know I
[2:18:06] know that I've never been invited over
[2:18:07] apparently she'd have to clean every
[2:18:09] doorknob in every place I sat and
[2:18:11] everything else okay so brother Ron
[2:18:14] asked
[2:18:15] specifically for brother Caleb's wife to
[2:18:18] come she is n
[2:18:30] emotional she comes to the man of
[2:18:34] God he just lays hands on her she
[2:18:39] collapses like oh my goodness she's
[2:18:42] going to break her
[2:18:43] kneecaps I mean honestly you know I'm
[2:18:46] carnal right at that moment only one
[2:18:49] time moment
[2:18:52] and I go
[2:18:53] what and brother Ron prays for it and
[2:18:56] and I'm going this is way way in
[2:18:59] Supernatural because brother Ron doesn't
[2:19:01] know anything and I don't hardly know
[2:19:04] anything and then brother Ron turns to
[2:19:06] me he says let's go I
[2:19:09] go
[2:19:12] why he says I just saw the angel of the
[2:19:15] Lord go through that
[2:19:19] ceiling there's another
[2:19:22] man young Mike help me the young
[2:19:26] one young one he is up in the three self
[2:19:31] Church hierarchy in
[2:19:34] college and uh the brothers have been
[2:19:37] working with him he's been coming to all
[2:19:38] their services and and he's got now 10
[2:19:42] 12 year old boy standing right beside
[2:19:44] him who knows zero
[2:19:47] English zero English
[2:19:51] and so when brother Ron turns to me he
[2:19:53] says let's go brother Tom the angel of
[2:19:56] the Lord just left the building I go I
[2:19:59] said if he's left I'm
[2:20:00] going and we take the man of God out the
[2:20:03] door and we go I turn like this before I
[2:20:07] go and and young
[2:20:09] one he's talking Chinese to his son and
[2:20:12] then he turns to me and he
[2:20:14] says my son who doesn't know any English
[2:20:19] has just told me
[2:20:21] he just saw the angel of the Lord go
[2:20:24] through the ceiling and he hasn't even
[2:20:26] given his heart to the
[2:20:30] Lord God works in
[2:20:33] Supernatural ways and I told brother Ron
[2:20:37] that young one is serving God he's out
[2:20:41] of the system loves the word and praise
[2:20:45] be to God that's what your pastor
[2:20:49] does
[2:21:01] I'm not doing that for an in accelator
[2:21:03] Friendship we're friends anyways but
[2:21:06] that's the other side of the story you
