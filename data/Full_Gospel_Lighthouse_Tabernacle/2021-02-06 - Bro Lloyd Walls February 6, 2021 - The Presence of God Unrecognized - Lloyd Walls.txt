TRANSCRIPT
========================================
they don't really know what what goes with it the the way up is that they're always if you want power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before god and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to christ to humble yourself before you that's really a power you show me a church that's humble real humble not a uh irrigation a church just a sweet humble church i'll show you a church that has the favor and power of god amen that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before god letting god just work to us don't have to make a lot of noise sometimes as the farmer said he went out to the field with his wagon and every time he hit a bump it just rattled and went on but when he come back he hit the same bump make no noise at all because it's loaded with good things so i think that's about right that we get filled up with the good things of god that the fruit of the spirit might be known through us as he revered so much the first corinthians 13 there how this lord give my body be burned and have all these things and have not charity it's nothing profits mean nothing we want to do that above all things is our individual souls that we're responsible before god it's it's you going to heaven it isn't whether i go or he goes it's you you first and you've got to look this up and come sweep before the lord and i've always found out that the man that humbles himself is a man that god exhausts

what god has done now the world don't recognize that maybe some of you might not even recognize but god knows amen we know he's had a tough time we talk to him on a regular basis but we know that god is alive and well tonight amen listen saint there's nothing impossible with god amen and i know many of you probably had sicknesses in all kind of situations of life but we tonight stand here as a christian saying we know that god is a healer we know that god is a deliverer amen the world doesn't recognize that tonight and i'd like to talk to you tonight if i put a topic on this the presence of god unrecognized amen for a christian we recognize but for the world they don't recognize what's going on amen so let us pray tonight before we go into the word of god heavenly father as we come before you once again this evening we're so thankful god for all that you've done for us thankful lord for this privilege we have to come and serve you tonight lord and worship your lord and talk about your great name one more time lord and even as i was reading god and just thinking how great that you are to us and how that you loved us so much god you gave your life for me that i could stand here tonight why shouldn't i talk about you lord why shouldn't i praise you tonight god for all that you've done for us we ask father that you reach down once again that you touch every heart every life every soul lord those that may be listening by the way of the internet tonight lord touch their lives this evening lord if there's one sick among them lord that you touch them tonight lord but the greatest thing lord is a saving of us so there's one tonight god that needs you we ask lord that you reach down and touch their lives this night father we thank you and we praise you for all things and we love you in jesus christ's name amen god bless you to turn saint matthew chapter 12 verse 38 tonight amen now brother ron and myself we've been friends for a long time even the day he was burnt 14 years ago we was together amen so we we've been around each other for a long time and i'm so thankful that god is moving in his life he still may have a few problems but we believe that god's a healer tonight amen we pray for him on a daily basis knowing that god is alive and well then god's moving amen for every day that we come through life you ought to say thank you lord that i've made it one more day amen same matthew chapter 12 38 then certain of the scribes and other pharisees answered saying master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonas for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here the queen of the south shall rise up in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here god bless you may be seated tonight amen hope you don't mind i take my jacket off tonight can't work good with a coat on yeah amen we just appreciate the lord tonight and he's been so good to us so real to us tonight we just thank him for all that he's done for us amen and notice the scripture reading tonight and and i won't hold you too long but i want you to understand scripture tonight many folks does not recognize when god is moving and doing things and so tonight when we begin to read scripture here and and it talks about as it was in the days of of jonas and as it was in the days of none of us it was in the days when the queen of the south came and so notice when we begin to look at these things tonight many people do not recognize until it's too late then they recognize god and so as i always been reading and looking through these things the last few days and just thinking how great that god is now notice when the queen of the south comes she wanted to come and hear the wisdom the wisdom of solomon she'd heard about solomon she'd heard listen saying many folks have heard about the word of god many folks know about god but they don't know god so the queen of the south she came to see solomon she wanted to hear all these things now notice she came from a mighty long way she came through the desert there on a camel not in an air-conditioned car i mean she didn't come and stand a nice motel somewhere but she came through the desert staying in tents and riding on the camel because she wanted to hear from the man of god for herself now if you turn to me to kings just a moment first kings chapter 10. i just want to read to you about the queen real quick and i want you to understand tonight there was something in her heart it was more than just head knowledge something was moving in her heart she wanted to come and hear about the very things that god was doing and you know the bible says tonight if any man lack wisdom let him ask of god amen if you want to know something from god tonight ask him amen you say well the preacher is going to give it to me the preacher might preach it to you but if god don't reveal it to you he's only saying words to you tonight it takes a revelation of jesus christ in this hour to understand this word and it's not for the world you say i thought it's whosoever will the world will not receive what god has done for us tonight the world's not going to receive this message that god gave us tonight so notice here what the queen said tonight amen in verse 1 first kings chapter 10 and verse 1 and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon concerning the name of the lord she came to prove him with hard questions and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bear spices very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart now notice what the scripture is saying all that was in her heart she came to ask him hard questions in other words she came she wanted to know about his wisdom it wasn't enough that she heard it wasn't enough that somebody else told her she wanted to hear for herself and i want to say to you tonight if you've not had an experience with jesus christ you need it for yourself the prophet god said every son daughter of god tonight must have a back side of the desert experience amen so she wanted to hear something from god so here she come to hear this great wisdom and notice verse 3 and solomon told her all her questions that was not anything hid from the king which he told her she was questioning him and i believe that we have a right to question god people say oh you're going to question god as a christian i believe we can question god are you listening i hope you understand and like we ask god god is this your word is this truth to us listen when we begin to look through the message of the hour and look at all these things many people you know they come along the way and you just bear with me a little while here tonight as they come and they talk about the message they talk about the man of god and yet now they were going away from the message did you know tonight the bible says that the devil believed in one god and trembled one god and my my dad used to say you know before he passed off he said if he believed in three gods he shook all the pieces but he believed in one god and trembled did you know the devil believes in the message of the hour tonight the devil knows that brother branham was the messenger for the seventh her church come on saints the devil believes that tonight but the world says oh we can't believe that and even people around the ranks of the medicine we can't believe that tonight but here come this woman asking hard questions and i believe tonight as a child of god as his son daughter of god tonight god i want to know that this is truth how many wants truth tonight i'm not here to play church i'm not here to say you know maybe this message is right i believe this message is right i believe this message tonight is what's going to carry us through from earth to glory amen we realize that god sent a prophet at that stage but notice here if you just understand this woman she came and she wanted to know everything about this king and here solomon was telling her now notice and when queen verse 4 when the queen of sheba had seen all solomon's wisdom and the house that he had built and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendants of his ministers and their apparel and his cup bears and his accents and by which he went up into the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her she was finding out exactly what he was and when she saw that she believed come on saints she'd heard and many people have heard tonight about the word of god many people have heard about the message of the hour but they don't recognize it until it's too late we go through scripture tonight and turn with me tonight over saint luke chapter 7. amen it's a real familiar scripture but i want you to notice this tonight amen saint john i mean saint luke i'm sorry saint luke chapter 7 tonight down about verse 36 and there was a little woman here and i'm not going to read it all tonight for time's sake but i want to read just a couple verses here and i want you to understand that this little woman come and she saw something that the others all around did not see now notice with me tonight down about verse 36 one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a center notice what it said she was a sinner when she knew that jesus said in the meat in the pharisee's house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and he'd wiped him with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them are you listening tonight and anointed them and understand here tonight with the ointment she brought and the prophet of god said that ointment are you listening tonight was the only that she bought from where she was selling her own body as a prostitute but he said if you will notice tonight here come these people in you know what we call the foot war splunk if you go back and read scripture tonight here they were they allowed the lord jesus to come through the door and never ministered service to him they did not anoint him with oil they didn't give him a kiss they didn't put a robe on him but they allowed him to come in and set over in the corner somewhere they'll notice all these people around the pharisee the prophet god said that this pharisee all he wanted to do was make a show of jesus christ he just wanted to make a show but said god had other orders god had other things in mind he said this little woman standing outside the door standing outside the fence was watching and she began to see that nobody was doing service for him but something struck her heart only one person only one woman in that hour recognized who jesus was only one person so listen saying out of all the pharisees that were there one woman that was a sinner woman saw these things happening he said over the lord how could that be tonight how did this foot worse flunk you ever let jesus get by how did he ever let him go by and never gave him any kind of service how could he do that it was orchestrated by god that one woman in that day one woman in that age was looking for something and god saw her heart many of us today we were lost in sin we was wandering around with no direction tonight but god called one woman listen the elected lady as the bible speaks up tonight here was that woman the world says oh she's a prostitute she's no good she's no count where did all we come from tonight but here she come looking she saw something that the pharisee who had a religious spirit couldn't see they couldn't see it you know in the age we're living in amen many people cannot see even religious folks can't see that jesus is moving amen we just had an election i'm not political understanding right but we just had an election and the prophet god had prophesied how this woman would come she'd either be president or vice president if you read the message tonight and follow along he said she'll have great power and here she stood the bible says in revelation 17 4 how she'd stand in purple hear this woman stood in purple with her little pearls on come on saints read the message just plain as day but the world can't see that but god has an elected lady that is seeing all the things that's happening in this world we're looking through spiritual eyes tonight but if you don't have spiritual eyes tonight you can't see what jesus is doing tonight and the world says all that we this is so great that we have a woman in authority and this is so great but let me tell you tonight they're not looking through the eyes that we're looking through they're looking at popularity and they're looking at all these sayings but i'm looking at through scripture tonight my eyes are focused on jesus christ tonight this is the end of time saints we're coming down to the end of the road where's your soul tonight amen you're either with god or you're against god there's only two roads tonight i don't care if you got a religious spirit that's not going to save you tonight you must have salvation you must have christ on the inside not a made-up and not a worked up but something that keeps you what makes it you know yesterday i was reading brother ryan actually when you called me yesterday i was sitting in the office reading i'd been crying why was you crying bro lord i got to looking in the word of god and i was thinking about my lord jesus he went to the cross of calvary because he loved me so much that he gave his life on the cross he went there and he bore those stripes for me take it personal and when you begin to look at it personal i want you to know god does something for you [Applause] many people go through life and they don't even know if god exists i got news for tonight the reason the atheists say god don't exist they know there is a god oh you listen tonight many people say god don't do this and god don't do that the reason god don't do it for them they don't believe god this is for the believers tonight oh we're living in an age and understand tonight i want to read something to you here amen the greatest battle ever fought listen what the prophet god said he said satan's army now watch he said satan's army brings diseases he said that's what satan is he's a destroyer are you listening hold on just a little bit he says satan the whole kingdom of satan is sickness death and sorrow frustrations and worry all on satan god is life faith joy peace that's what god is tonight oh you may be sick tonight but i got news for you this evening you can die you listen you can die but if you don't know god there's only two places you're going to go you're going to go to hell if you don't know god but if i die sick tonight i can go to heaven i want this to sink in tonight there's only two roads tonight you say well how about the baptist road and the methodist road in the pentecostal i'm sorry for all those roads tonight there's only one road amen and if they believe jesus christ they're my brother if they don't they're on the wrong road tonight it doesn't matter what's over the church store tonight what's in your heart tonight it must be jesus christ in our hearts tonight the presence of god unrecognized that's what happened to so many people and notice what he said he said there's two great forces that's coming together he said they're battling right here in the building right now are you listening he said they're battling right now the battle day by day with you he said every force satan following you along that great big kingly priestly goliath trying to scare the liver out of you that's what he said he said but god you're fortified with the gospel with the word of truth around your loins he's a glory preacher that's what it is helmet of salvation the shield of faith and the sword waving in your hand he said satan i'm coming to meet you you meet me in the name of science you meet me in the name of culture you meet me in the name of organization you meet me in this name or that name or some other name but i meet you in the name of the lord god of israel i'm coming after you and give way listen even death itself cannot stand there chop a hole right through it he said that's right you say i'm sick tonight that's a spirit an evil spirit from the devil tonight come on saints he's over beloved how about the woman over in saint matthew that began to say you know lord my daughter's vexed with the devil my daughter's got a devil on her won't you come and heal her and jesus didn't say a word at first then the disciples came along and they began to say to him you know just send her away she troubles us and jesus began to talk to her i just want to say a few things because i got too many scriptures to read tonight and so he began to talk to her and she said you know he said i might come but to the lost to the house of lordship of israel and she began to say but lord even the dogs even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the masters table listen saying she wasn't asking for just a healing of a body she wasn't just asking for salvation but she said my daughter is vexed with the devil my daughter has a devil owner come on maybe you got children tonight you got loved ones got devils on them [Applause] god's a deliverer tonight and the lord jesus he said i'm talking about the faith of a person he called her a dog and she still trusted him and believed in him and worshiped him come on say god knows what he's doing tonight so here come this woman and the lord jesus because of her persistence wanting something from god she wasn't asking for herself she wasn't asking for her neighbor she said god my daughter is possessed with a devil she's vexed tonight and jesus came on the scene and touched here i want to ask you how many you pray for your loved ones tonight [Applause] let me pray for your loved ones tonight i got loved ones that i care about tonight i got children tonight i got grandchildren tonight i got extended family tonight that i pray for on a regular basis i said god only you can do that but i'm standing here tonight i'll tell you many years ago i was on a fast and the lord spoke to me i can take you to the spot in the road where the lord spoke to me said i give you all your children are you listening tonight i know that my god is a deliverer tonight i know that my god is on the move tonight i know he's still saving tonight but the world doesn't recognize the very presence of almighty god even the disciples did recognize what was happening there until jesus began to talk to that woman by himself you say number lord so understand tonight this woman that went to do service for jesus when she went to do service and she was standing outside and she saw they didn't wash his feet or all these things she worked her way through now i want to tell you the same footwork splunky that allowed jesus to get in he didn't stop her either he didn't stop her either i want to tell you tonight resist the devil he'll flee come on resist the devil he'll flee and here she came in she began to anoint our lord jesus she began to cry she began to walk right dry his feet with her hair she was doing all these things and then she's wondering what is he going to say to me but i got news for you tonight my lord jesus i'm going to read something to you the prophet god said when my lord came on the scene he began to call the pharisee he began to call him and you know now his ear has been perked up tell me something lord you're a guest in my house you know you're a guest about tell me something good he didn't know what the lord was getting ready to tell him or he had kept his mouth shut but tell me something good lord just just tell me something you know why here i said you know i invited you in my house and the prophet god said he only wanted to make a show but he said there was a little prostitute out on the street he said all them listen close all them religionists there he said the whole company did not recognize him and a little woman of ill fame she looked in through perhaps a gate and she seen him sitting like a wallflower he said that's the way he is today amongst a bunch of religions too a wallflower unwelcome unwanted filthy dirty holy roller they call it some kind of a person that isn't in their right mind a fortune teller mental telepathy or some kind of an evil name he said in jesus listen i'll get to that he said but jesus began to speak a word against the son of man he said anywhere that they speak against the son of man it shall be forgiven are you listening tonight but when the holy ghost comes to do the same thing one word will never be forgiving you you seen the bro lord he said but there that little woman seen he needed service how many want to work for the lord how many look for an opportunity to do something for the lord you know some people think you know it's just well it's us for no more but god wants you to do something for somebody it may be a smile it may be a kind word you know people say when you get ready to do something oh how much money are you going people look at it wrong sometimes just a smile from somebody will help them just a kind word and sometimes you just need to stop sometimes say you know god bless you today how you doing today and sometimes that's all they need but notice here the prophet god said that little woman she seen he needed service and she rushed in real quickly went and got an alabaster box full of oil probably had brought it with the money from her prostitution as i just said earlier he said she might have thought he is a prophet but i remember another woman in my mix here he said or in the fix another character he said that had the opportunity and she recognized him but here she come she heard about god she knew about god but she never met god that's just tonight but now she came and she's got the opportunity to kneel at his feet it's not enough saints to go to church it's not enough to read your bible it's not enough to listen and read the message of the hour you must have an experience with jesus christ amen you must come to a place god i need you more today than anything in my life i need you more today than this food i'm eating i need you more of the day than the clothes i have on my back or the car i drive or the house i live in i need you lord for it's heaven and earth amen matthew 24 35 heaven and earth gonna pass away but he said my word will not pass away i would rather have his word tonight than all the other things in this life this word is what's going to carry us through it's over the lord so notice here tonight amen as this woman was here and he began to say she ran in she got real close to him and she felt so guilty he said that's the way a real penitent center feels in his presence is guilty think back in your life you know when you do something wrong you feel guilty a child of god if you make a mistake in life you feel guilty till you repent you know what makes you repent the holy ghost on the inside amen there's nothing wrong with falling and making a mistake but let me tell you don't stay down to get up amen if you fall down you make a mistake say god i'm sorry i'm sorry maybe this but get yourself up and it takes more of a man more of a woman to say i'm sorry and get up and keep going on with god than to just wallet in your penny and the next thing you know you'll be right up back in the world and you're wondering what in the world happened come on saying get up he's all about lord so notice here tonight this little woman she ran in she got close he said tears began to fall she was trying to hide they dropped on his feet she was going to anoint him but the tears dropping on his feet and she began to wipe them and crying and wiping them with their hair with their hands and notice he said his feet was all getting musked with the dirt that was on it he said if you really want to believe it with the stink of the animals of the trail everyone walked the same trail and there it was the stink on them sitting there her tears was dropping on his feet and she was trying to wipe them off and she had no towel i ain't gonna read it all for time's sake but he said can you imagine her beautiful hair how it smelled when she got done he said because everybody walked the same trail everybody done you know the way the animals he said it was maybe a terrible sight but he said in god's eyes it was a such a beautiful thing because she loved him so much she was giving her all to him she was showing the world that listen this was happening tonight changed i want you to understand all these things were happening for his memorial come on read your bible this was a memorial for the lord jesus christ tonight he was so blessed by her doing that but here said simon over here in the corner you know just kind of whispering to himself if the lord hadn't knew what type of woman she was if the lord had known that she you know was a bad woman maybe he had even been with her come on read your bible maybe he'd even been with her he knew what kind of woman she was and he's sitting here judging if the lord had a new see he don't chose the lord to come into his house to make light of him the prophet god said he wanted the lord to be a showman for him but he said god's not a showman my lord's not a showman tonight he just does what he says he's not a lot of talk tonight he does what he says amen if you promise some tonight fulfill it if you don't promise you don't have to worry about but god every promise in the word tonight he fulfilled for you and i tonight and here he said this man was sitting here he said all the great big crowd around nobody recognized the very presence of god except one woman just one woman and in this last day only one woman i said over and over and over only one woman is going to recognize the very presence of almighty god tonight amen and this one woman she was doing god a service and i believe the bride of christ tonight this woman that god has chose we are the elected lady tonight god has chosen us to carry this great gospel in this last day so well i didn't ask to be here neither did i but god chose you to be here tonight the bible says in saint john chapter 15 then about verse 16 ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you god chose you to live in this generation all you young people tonight listen god chose you i know some of you think well you know i i'm not going to be able to get married and i'm not going to be able to have any kids because the end of time is coming and we know your thoughts tonight we was like that too when we were teenagers [Music] but listen god chose you to be in this age [Music] turn around look at somebody i was chosen by god man didn't choose me man didn't choose you but god chose you tonight you didn't ask to be a boy and you didn't ask to be a girl god chose you to be who you are tonight don't try to change what god made you tonight god created us tonight come on saints god chose you men be real men you young boys be a real man tonight be a real man and you young ladies you'll be a real woman tonight let god do something in your life i'm so you know i realize you know even in back home in richmond you know there are so many things happening and you see this and you see that and you're wondering wow and people say well bro lord you shouldn't say anything about it but as a minister of the gospel i got to preach it as a minister of gospel god did not create adam and steve he created adam and eve [Applause] are you listening tonight i'm not trying to be funny but in this hour we're living in even in our own government you know and they've already if you don't understand tonight the catholic is basically running their country look at who's in congress and senate and all that look at their backgrounds man y'all quiet now transgender in the white house oh yes they're sick all right somebody said to me oh they were born that way no sir it's a spirit of the devil it's a spirit of the enemy you young girls and young boys this at night if you don't get ahold of god you could be one of them oh but lord it's only happening in the new testament i got new it happened in sodom and gomorrah and god wants us to be set free from these spirits but i got to tell you tonight if you don't stay in the word of god amen and in the message of the hour those spirits will creep up on you and you'll be one of them and you wonder how did i end up in this condition tonight you must stay in the word of god tonight you can't make it through this world on your own tonight you must have jesus you so brother this woman saw something going on she saw something about to take place only one person out of all the crowd recognized jesus the world did not recognize his very presence when paul give me just a few more minutes when paul was on his road to damascus he went when paul was going down to damascus i mean he had already stood there beside us stephen as they killed stephen so something happened in his heart while he watched him kill stephen something that happened to him and now on his way to damascus he'd been you know getting orders from the high priest i'm going down and i'm going to take care of these chris he was a religious leader are you listening tonight religion don't save you religion is only a covering you can put on a robe and you can take it off but you can't put salvation on and take it off salvation is on the inside and so here pete paul was on his way and on his way to damascus a light shine from heaven now if you read scripture tonight it blinded paul was the only one that blinded the others heard a voice but they saw no man read your bible tonight you read it over next chapter 9. but here was paul now and he spoke blind and he said begin to talk to the lord now how did paul know it was the lord he'd been taught by the great gamiel very smart he was a theologian god saves theologians too paul was a theologian and the light shined from heaven he recognized it was none other than god himself speaking to him he recognized it was god coming down to him and he began to talk to god and notice what the lord does only one man saw the light or was blinded by the light just one and the lord tells him to go down to one man's house named ananias and then and i said don't bring that man here lord i don't want him in my house read your scripture tonight i don't want him down here he's killed some of our loved ones and you know he stoned them and he he's doing all these things to christians and jesus said but he's one of us how about us tonight we look at people sometime and we judge them but god knows the intents of the heart tonight every one of us come sinful way come on say we were born in sin shaped an iniquity come this world speaking life and god had to bring us out of the world tonight you say no bro lord so notice tonight if we're not careful we'll begin to look at people oh he can't be saved and he can't be saved and she can't be saved but god said they're one of mine the bible says all the father's given me and i'll in no wise lose none now understand tonight when we look at scripture tonight and we look at the word of god tonight god is doing something in this hour the world doesn't recognize what's going on and we step back and we're seeing all the things fulfill right before our eyes and we wonder how long do we have lord well i do i don't know about y'all how much longer is it lord no man knows the day and or the hour but god knows when he's coming tonight saints but what he's doing he's given us everything and and we have in the word of god tonight the bible says that we have everything we have need of to make it in a rapture you were to be shouting and rejoicing tonight that god chose you to live in the seventh church age because i can stand in laodicea and i can look all the way back amen to ephesus but listen i'm not in laodicea i'm only walking through laodicea i'm not in this world i'm only walking through this world amen but in this bright age i want to tell you tonight say that god is looking down and our spiritual eyes can look all the way back and apostle paul being that first messenger god let him lay the foundation for all the other messengers amen and when our prophet come on the scene on then in revelation chapter 3 we begin to see there how that he begin to preach this word to the end time now notice when jesus came amen the presence of god unrecognized when jesus came he came on the scene and they rejected him not because of his looks not because of maybe the way he walked but because of the word that he brought are you listening it was the word you said number one lord so when our prophet came on the scene in this last church age the same thing began to happen they followed him remember there was three pulls brother ron they followed him put that sign in the hand multitudes of people followed him they followed him when he discerned the thoughts of the heart but when he come to that third pool and it come the revealing of the word of god what happened they turned their backs and they walked away from the man of god they did the prophet of god in our day just like they did jesus he even turned to the twelve and said won't you go also come on say god knows who's he is tonight and who ain't god's looking down in our lives tonight he knows everything about us you say oh but lord so hold on with me just a few more minutes we begin to look and we see all these things are happening i want to ask you how many is worried about the hour we're living in i talk to people on a daily basis they're worried about what's happening somebody said he said why ain't you worried i know the back of the book i know the back of the book and i know i'm getting ready to leave here i know what revelation says come on saying we know the back we know the ending say when's he coming i don't know but i know one thing i want to live my life until he comes perfect as i can for him oh yeah i make mistakes because i'm in the flesh but i got news for you tonight if you don't live for him when the end comes you present you'd be like one of them standing around the house when the pharisee had jesus there how did she get in there you know i made no wonder medium said how did she get in there what happened to the food wars flunky what happened to the man at the door how did she get in there and you know the devil sits back and says how did how did he get in there why ain't he dead yet come on why ain't he dead yet you're looking at a man tonight yes sir i'm a miracle walking around but so are you we've been in car wrecks we've had other sicknesses we had things happen in their life well i'll be honest with you the doctors even told my parents i wouldn't live to be a teenager hardly but i'm here tonight why because god chose me to be here tonight you're here tonight because god chose you to be here well i just decided i'm going i got news for you tonight there's something on the inside amen it works to the outside and it causes you to get prepared to go to the house of god oh brother lord you don't understand tonight listen we realize when we look through scripture tonight and i i got plenty of notes but i ain't going to read them all tonight we realize when we look through scripture tonight and so many things happen and give me just a few more minutes when joseph amen joseph was born joseph was raised at his daddy's house and his daddy saw that joseph well there was something very special about joseph and he made him a coat of many colors and he listened to his dreams and his visions and he held them in his heart and his brothers despised him let me go a little farther they hated joseph i'm going to bow down to my brother my baby brother that's what think about it i'm going to bow down who does he think he is he's crazy now i'm gonna go through all the things tonight we we know tonight that joseph being the man that he was when he went down they put him in the pit they won't actually want to kill him but i believe it was reuben said no let's not kill him don't let his blood be on our hands so we're going to take him you know we put him in a pit they put him in a pit they went back to get him he was gone he still got sold into egypt then he spent about i think it was around 13 years in prison something like that because he was light on by a woman potiphar's wife she began to lie on the man of god because she wanted him for herself and him in the man that he was he ran for his life spent 13 years in prison something like that i want you to know saying while he was there he gained favor with the guards he gained favor with those in jail see but if god loved him why would god allow him to go through this if god loved you that's what the world says if god loved you why's he letting you go through this if god loved you why has he allowed you to go through certain circumstances of life you need to turn right back around to the devil and tell the devil god does love me and this is happening for a purpose this has happened for a reason it may not even be for me it may be for my family it may be for another lost one somewhere but god is allowing these things to come on my life that others could see christ in me amen we know tonight listen brother ron's sitting here and he's one of the men i know that has had more things happen to him than the many men i know of but he's still standing tonight are you listening he's still standing tonight why god doing something in his life sometimes we get sick we have to be in the hospital and we wonder why is this happening because god's allowed it maybe we need to talk to somebody else even the doctors i'm made to believe are amazed at what's happening say why bro lord because they you know they know about god but they don't know god but now they're looking at a man you've got all these things going on in your body and your body's changing let's go back and look again and let's go back and look again come on say they're wondering and they go back i may believe even after he leaves they go back and look at those pictures again why brother because the doctors are finding it hard to believe that what is here scientists listen they're doing the best they could do these doctors are they're seeing all these things but they don't know the great creator that we serve they don't know the jesus that we serve tonight and so they're looking at their charts they're looking at all the science and they say there's no way this man can live but god has another plan tonight when lazarus was four dead four days in the ground the world said he's done the world said he's finished but god said i still got to work for him to do amen i got new skin tonight when the world says you can and no way make it tonight jesus says i have a bride that's called by my name tonight amen the wife the bride hath made herself ready amen we're getting ready for rapture we're getting ready to go out of here and here was joseph he ends up being the right-hand man of pharaoh i'm not gonna read it all tonight but i want you to notice now he's the right-hand man of pharaoh and here he is you know he came from a mighty long way from a little boy a little boy that was born a little boy that was israelite a little boy that didn't mean nothing to nobody else but god said that's my chosen servants and he came people would thought god don't love him god does love you god don't care god does care god was getting him ready for position he didn't really know how to handle but god prepared him and got him ready and here he stands now and his brothers come in because the drought in the land you know your bible tonight there was a drought in the land and so his brothers came in and in his heart he was crying but he began to give them food to eat and he began to ask questions to an interpreter because he didn't learn the language of the egyptians are you listening to life he looked different he's grown up he's got a beard maybe he's speaking in another language he's got a gentile bride read your bible i tell you god's word is full of so many lovely stories tonight but i got news for it's not just stories this is reality this is a real happening tonight and here he stands and he wants to reveal himself but it's not time yet god is coming this hour bringing his word to the world but it's not time yet to call us completely out of here god is calling a bride tonight listen saints and i don't know about you but i'm still looking for the last seed tonight i'm still trying to find the last soul tonight and when the last one comes in we're out of here he said bro lord you believe that tonight it's scripture tonight i believe it tonight amen it's in the message of the hour tonight we are looking for the last soul tonight and notice here was joseph now and his brothers come several times and the last time he come he put everybody out of the house and he stood there just himself and his brothers and he begins to reveal himself to his brethren he said bro lord god knew the hour and he stood there and began to reveal himself to his brethren when he began to do all these things i want you to catch this tonight when he began to reveal himself his brothers backed up they got scared they knew what they done did you know your enemy tonight knows what he's done to you he knows but can you forgive him tonight and here's to joseph he knew what his brother's done to him he asked about his daddy he asked many questions but he said brethren don't be afraid god has sent me before you to preserve life for you and god has come in this hour oh you listen don't be afraid to work for god don't be afraid to read his word don't be afraid to take his word tonight god has put it in our hearts tonight saints amen god has come in this hour and listen many people are afraid to even turn to the book of revelation you know that i was talking to a man one day he said oh we don't go to revelation i said why he said we don't understand it i said i do well how can you understand it for the lord i said because god sent a prophet in this hour come on saint god sent a man of god in this hour and all the mysteries have been revealed you may not understand them all i may not understand them all but god has opened this great book that we can understand all the great mysteries in this hour you want to rejoice tonight that god chose you to live in this generation say brothers and sisters i i don't know how to say it to you tonight but we believe that god is so rich to us tonight and here joseph that had been hated listen the bible says envy but actually envy is jealousy his brothers were jealous because god was speaking to him and dealing with him don't be jealous you ought to rejoice with somebody if god's using them we all can't be preachers we all can't be song leaders we all can't be deacons we all can't be musicians abide in the calling we're in god has called you if i want an electrician to work on my house i want to call somebody that's got some experience because i'm not an electrician i get shocked i'm not a carpenter so if i need something none i have to call a carpenter i was talking to a man yesterday i said look the proper tools make a job so much easier so if you're electrician be good at it have the proper tools if you're a carpenter be good at it have the proper tools whatever god's called you to do don't try to take another man's place say god you call me to be this and you call me to do this don't pretend to be a christian many people pretend to be certain occupations i'm a truck driver by trade i've always been short-haul don't get a wrong example but i had a guy come one time and he wanted to drive a truck and he had all these credentials all these papers so i gave him a road test he was terrible so we got back to my yard i said you know thank you i don't need you he said but sir and he couldn't back up if you can't back up you don't need to drive a truck and i said sir i said you have all these credentials but you don't have the experience a lot of people listen saints a lot of people can carry this word under their arms just like the prophet they can carry this message under their arm just like the prophet but if you've it's not been revealed to you you only have a lot of credentials but you don't have what you need in your heart amen i got news for you tonight it's more than reading these words tonight these words must come off of these pages and come to our hearts tonight amen it's more than just saying that god sent a prophet it's looking in here and seeing what god said about the prophets over the lord listen saints i want you to understand god has chosen us in this generation he's given us the greatest message that's ever been but you've got to have more than just carrying around credentials you've got to have it in your hearts [Applause] and the man said to me well let me just practice a little bit with your truck and i'll get better and i said i said no thank you i said if i send you somewhere to pick up a loan you came back into a dock i've lost freight i've lost all this money because you're driving the truck for nothing if you're not an electrician tonight and you go pull that fuse panel off and you touch the wrong wires you might burn up your whole house are you listening tonight i'm simple preacher i've got all the credentials right here i need tonight in my hand but if they're not here it don't mean anything it doesn't mean much understand tonight i i'm trying to close when god calls us tonight when god moves in our lives tonight don't be one of them just standing off in the distance saying well is is is god really doing something you see tonight brother ron said in here and i'll use this for an example none of you have saw actually the cancer that was in his body you might have saw some x-rays you might have saw some pictures but because it's on the inside and you don't see the devil will say oh wasn't there no way y'all listen to me at night you know if we see somebody's got a broken arm we're saying god god healed it but to see a man that's been through what brother ron has been through i've had people say well you know we really don't know if it was that bad or not who are you we really because they're not a believer but a real true believer you know what a true true believer says we know that he was sick we know that god touched him we know that god did a miracle in his life that's what a real believer says but the world says oh that can't be this gospel tonight it's not for everyone everyone can't swallow it this gospel is to the believer of jesus christ this gospel is to them amen that will carry this word not just in their hand but in their heart i know we're living in the age of technology and sometimes you know we we don't have our bible maybe in our possession but you know that you've got it on your phone now i got the message on my phone now i can listen i listen people don't even know i'm listening because they got a hearing aid and it comes through my phone to my hearing aid and so i can be talking to somebody and listen at the message out at the same time [Applause] come on my wife said daddy what are you doing i said i'm listening out a message she said you're talking to me and you're listening at a message i said yeah think about it saints so we have all these things at our fingertips but it's up to you what you do with it now this phone can be used for good and bad you got the holy ghost tonight it'll be used for good but if you don't have the holy ghost tonight you go to websites you go to places you've got no business and then you'll begin to feel guilty because you know you're doing wrong come on saints but it can be used for good tonight just like this word the devil uses the same bible that we preach out of the same bible that we talk about the devil we use the very same scriptures and just change one word like he did with eve just one word you must have the baptism of the holy ghost in order to withstand the devil in this hour and if you don't have the holy ghost tonight i want to say to you it's more important than anything you can do in your life it's more important than another job it's more important than a greater position on
