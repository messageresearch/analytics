I've made mistakes. I often slip just common flesh and bones. I got to prove someday what I heard this message say that I'm of a special kind. For when he was on the cross, I was on his mind. Yes, he knew me. Yet he still loved me. He whose glory makes the heaven shine. so unworthy of such mercy. Yet when he was on the cross, I was on his mind. A look of love was on his face, the thorns on his head. The blood was on that scarlet robe. It stained a crimson ring. Though his eyes were on the crowd that day, he looked ahead in time. Cuz when he was on the cross, I was on his mind. Yes, he knew me. Yet he still love me. Thank you. He whose glory makes the heavens to shine. See, I was so unworthy of such mercy. Yet when he was on the cross, I was on his mind. Yes. When he was on the cross, we was on his mind. Sometimes I wonder, is he faithful? Does he see me in my trouble? Does he understand? Sometimes I question if he's able. Can he resue? Can he save me? again and again. When I look back, did he move every mountain? Did he part every sea? Yes, he did. So, yes, he did. Did he defeat the darkness? Did he deliver me? Yes, he did. So, yes, he can. Yes, he did. So, yes, he can. &gt;&gt; Sometimes those voices try to tell me I've forgotten and I've fallen too far from his hands. But I know what kind of God he is. And I'm trusting in his promises. I'm believing and I'm singing. Yes, he can. Did he move every mountain? Did he part every sea? Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Did he defeat the darkness? Did he deliver me? Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Yes, he did. So yes, he can. I've seen too much now. I can't deny. He's come through every single time. From the beginning until the end. He did. He will. He can. Did he move every mountain? Did he part every sea? Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Did he defeat the darkest? Did he deliver me? Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Did he move every mountain? Did he part every sea? Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Did he defeat the darkness? Did he deliver me? Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Yes, he did. Yes, he can. Amen. Amen. That's the authority of a believer right there. Yes, he did. So, yes, he can. Why don't we give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight? Amen. Do you believe that he did it then? &gt;&gt; So, he can do it right now. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God that I serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And it's good to be in the house of the Lord this evening, isn't it? Amen. What a wonderful time that we're looking forward to this weekend and having our brother Thomas Ber from Elkton, Kentucky here. We're just our souls are excited and uh I'm just so so honored to have our brother to be here this weekend. I I remember when I was sitting out there on our uh we were actually eating at brother Brad Pal's out there on his back porch and I just I just felt the witness of the Holy Ghost come down and and I just asked Brother Tom would you would you come and minister for us and and he and he agreed to it and just felt a real witness of the Holy Spirit and then just to find the right timing and then just to see brother Tom's background and to see what the Lord's doing here with uh with those coming out of the Amish movement and brother Thomas came out of that many many years ago and just just to see what our Lord is doing right now. I believe that God is always perfectly on time. I don't know what you come expecting this weekend, but I'd say get your cups ready. I'd say ask big things because our God is more than able to do great things. Amen. Amen. Let's just stand this evening as we get ready to invite our brother Tom. Let's sing a few worship songs. So, just want to make a mention that tomorrow after the service, we'll be having a baptismal and want to be remembering the candidates that'll be taking on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in baptism. But if you if you would desire to be baptized, the water is ready. And we just say like the scripture says, water's here. What do hinder you? So, amen. Let's have a seis. Amen. You can lock me up in a prison. Oh, and throw away the king. Oh, take take away my vision. Oh, from these eyes that now, oh now can see will defy me. know the food I eat. And even my hands and my feet. is wrong. Yes, I I know my Jesus and I I can still go free. He said that I I could still go free. Yes, he Oh, tell me what kind of a man who would reach out his hand and do this for me. worthy to and not feel to kill. than a man on the cross. He put my name in his will and said that I I can steal. Oh no. Oh, now I never clue. I understand. Oh, I need to leave strong. Oh, take on the road of an earthly man. Oh, feel the pain of flesh. Oh, flesh and bone. Thank you, Jesus. Oh then too late later try that and hold the path. Oh that led to Calary. Oh, where those blood those blood restains they broke off in chains and said that I I can steal. Hallelujah. Do you believe it tonight? But those blood rich saints said you can go free. He said behind I can still brother Thomas as you come. Oh reach down his hand and do this for me. So to me to you my man on the cross had my name in his will. He said that I can still go free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ unto himself according to according to the good pleasure &gt;&gt; of his will. How many believes you're in his will? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this evening. We greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is certainly good to be here. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, Amen. We just greet you from the saints up in Elton, Kentucky. I know every one of them would want to say, "God bless you, brother and sister." How many of you are all part of the family of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And I told my church one time, what would what would it be if Brother Donny's church, Brother Tim's church, y'all's church, and all in our church, what would it be if we was all together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; It'd be heaven, wouldn't it? &gt;&gt; It' be heaven. Amen. Cuz how many believe that's one day? &gt;&gt; That's what that's the plan. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless you. You can be seated for a minute. And uh usually when a preacher tells you that, you know that it might be a little long. Amen. So, amen. I just I got a lot I like to speak with you by the help and the grace of the Lord, but we do want to thank brother uh brother Andrew and brother Ron for the opportunity to speak to you. Amen. And so, we just want to share a couple testimonies maybe before we get started. Amen. Uh God is certainly good. &gt;&gt; And I think it was probably six months ago you asked me to come preach and I says, "Well, wow, I ain't got to worry about study. That's going to be way up ahead." And so for six months, I've been taking a little notes here and not notes there and and uh for the last week, I guess, you know, I took just tried not to do too much work. Thank you, musicians. Amen. Not to do too much work and just study and and write things down and so forth. And so, Amen. I thought, you know, if I if your man can't get ready in six months, I don't know if he ever will get ready, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And on the other hand, we've been getting ready so long. So, my my my I I can show you about 10 pages here. So, you know, Amen. We're we're very ready. But anyway, we just uh we prayed about, you know, what to speak and and so forth because there's so much. How many believes we have so much? &gt;&gt; Amen. And I thought, you know, I was a little under a little bit of anxiety or whatever. Just Lord, you know, I I'm not here to perform. I'm not here to be a somebody. I'm not trying to be like somebody else or whatever. And I was just praying. Amen. And the Holy Spirit spoke to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I was listening to Brother Andrew speaking uh just the other day. And during his sermon, he said something about he, you know, the Holy Spirit just told him just to let it loose. Let it loose. And I thought, well, the Holy Spirit told me just be yourself. &gt;&gt; Just be yourself. Amen. How many believe that's what we want to be? &gt;&gt; Just be yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we do want to thank each and every one of you for your prayers. Amen. I've got my warrior queen with me tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know if y'all have ever heard me say that, but you know, and brother Ed Borto, God bless you. It's good to see you. I didn't know you would know you'd be here, but God bless you. It's good to see you. As you know, you know, about a little over a year ago, I thought that being a pastor for about 33 years now, uh, you know, I thought I had went through every trial that there, you know, bought could be, you know, and so, you know, and I and I I'll kind of preach to my s uh my uh my church there that, you know, once you pass a test, I don't know that God just puts it on to you again. You know, usually when you're in school, if you pass a test, you move up the next grade. And uh so I said, "Well, you know, we've had it pretty nice. It's going pretty smooth, pretty nice, you know, and and uh you know, and I thought, I don't know, you know, and then when we went to the doctor, you know, and the diet doctor, you know, diagnosed her with stage four breast cancer and said that it was in her bones, all the way in her bones, and she had complained a little bit about a pain in her back and and a couple other spots where it was just hurting." Amen. And um uh so we kind of kind of got a glimpse that it was probably in that that bone, you know, or whatever. And but it was in her lungs. All in her lungs. All in her all of her I asked the doctor when he said it's in her lymph nodes. And I says, "Well, how many li too many to count, you know?" So I guess they're all connected somehow. And so all her lymph nodes, all in her lungs, uh breast of course, and then in her bones. And so and a little bit later on the doctor had said, you know, she's just got a lot of cancer. kept saying a lot of cancer and uh so when I asked the doctor also when we was first in at the emergency room he said um after the other one had went over with Donna and showed her all the different ones and stuff and I said well what where do we go from here doctor and a female doctor came in and said uh you know and she began to talk to her and I says what do we do now do we remove the breast or where do we go that wouldn't uh that wouldn't do anything but leave a scar and and then she looks her in the face and says just so you Oh, you are going to die of breast cancer. And it pretty rubbed her up, you know. And of course, I was shocked and and it it kind of shocked me and I began to cry a little and, you know, kind of get go on her lap and and so forth. But she just stroke my head and said, you know, don't you worry, honey. Said, that's what she said. That's not what I said. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And she kept talking about how that she says, you know, it's not my faith, it's his faith. I got two grandkids that I'm teaching school and I've been in my line of duty and I'm not going to go nowhere. Thank you, brother. Amen. And so I'm not going anywhere. And of course, our whole family had to be gathered together. And to make a long story short, she had says, "Look, you're all acting like I'm dead already. I'm not dead and I'm not dying. And so y'all get back to building your house and doing whatever you're doing. And then the atmosphere and we all had to come up in that right in faith. Amen. And so do you know by God's grace the last PET scan and everything they had they said it's gone out of all of her lymph nodes out of her lungs and the he bones are healing and she's feeling great. Give God glory. Thank you Jesus. Stand up honey. There's my wife right there. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is good. God is good. He's worthy of praise. Amen. And she's feeling really good. And Amen. Amen. So before I tell you the next testimony, I want to finish that one. And like I said, that was and the way that it felt. I know brother Ron, he's went through the same thing. He's went through a a a very very big trial, very big test. But the way that it felt when they told us that was it felt like we were like in a Roman arena, like we had been thrown in an arena, &gt;&gt; with a a with a devil, with a gladiator that was experienced, very experienced, a Goliath. &gt;&gt; Let's just say Goliath. That's right. &gt;&gt; And he's a very very trained warrior. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that the you know the the story was is you're going to have to fight and this fight is to the death. &gt;&gt; Oh come on. &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to die here. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to die here. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And like my wife says, I'll tell you what who's dying. It's the devil is dying. Amen. Not my wife. It's going to be the devil that dies. Hallelujah. Amen. And so I felt like Lord I have not had a test. We have not had a test like that. Amen. Because I say I because she's part of me and I'm part of her. I mean know you know you're one. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so you know it was just you know but we're just so grateful for the mercy of almighty God. Amen. And so when when I seen her faith Amen. even way above mine. Uh, you know, that's when I said, "That girl right there, she's my warrior queen that God's using my wife to whoop the devil with." Amen. &gt;&gt; And she'll credit God. She says, "It ain't my faith. Don't say it's mine, but she's had it." And God give it to her. How many believe? Amen. That's the way it should be. It's got to be God's faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then a then a miracle. To me, it was a miracle even today. Amen. because you know we've we've had a lot of lot lot of things that we've went through and because of the things that we've went through hope you don't mind me sharing this brother an Amen. Um I've had I've had u a fear of coming up here like this in front of anybody but really in my church and weddings and and places like that. You know, you get a little nervous coming out here just because you're you don't want to say anything wrong or you really want to please the Lord and there's a little bit of that nervousness there. But this was not this is on a whole different level. This was a demon that would just man it would just over overwhelm you and make you feel like you can't do that. You just can't do it. You can't do it. And so and I've had that for quite a long time. Maybe in maybe 15 years or something. And so I know my church back home is there watching. it. And so, uh, you know, and it's been I've overcome it a little bit seems like, but I've just never and I could come out here and start talking or pray or whatever and then get past it and go, but I'm telling you what, that old spirit of fear and it was nothing but a devil. &gt;&gt; It would really hit you and it would just oh, it just make you start trembling, you know. And so, uh, so I was and it it actually that devil tried to come on me even today because, you know, I really hadn't gotten over it and everything. But um and I just rebuked it in the name of the Lord. And I says, "I'm going to talk to Brother Ron. I'm going to talk to Brother Ron because I've heard of all the different people that he's prayed for and the Lord honors his prayer and everything." And I says, "We're just going to as my friend, but we're going to we're going to whoop this thing and I'm going to talk to Ron." So we sat down in his living room today for very long time and and I shared with him, you know, the anxiety and that extra fear and you know that comes and all and um and uh so he he talked to me and gave me a lot of really good advice. Really good advice. I'm telling you, y'all got a just a wonderful pastor. Amen. &gt;&gt; The best of the best. Amen. We Amen. Amen. And so anyway, to end that, I just want to say that we prayed together. Amen. And since we've prayed, Amen. This is the first time I've come out here without any of that fear. &gt;&gt; First time. Say, "Praise the Lord." Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. So remember, if you've got something that's bothering you for a year, you remember you just keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; God will hook that thing sooner or later. Amen. Just keep pressing on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is good, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you richly. Amen. If you will, once again, let's stand and we'll just get into the word of God. &gt;&gt; Bless. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So, I do appreciate being here. I just want to say that uh I'm here and by God's grace, I want to I'm here to Amen. tell you about my Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; I like that song. Don't you? Let me tell you about my Jesus. Amen. My granddaughters, they're they sing that sometimes if they have the other little girl with them and so forth, but I love that song. Let me tell you about my Jesus. And so, that's what we want to do with the help of the Lord tonight. Amen. Turn your Bibles if you will. We'll go just into the book of Hebrews. Hebrews. Amen. We will try not to hold you too awful long. At least not past 9 9:30. Okay. But I I do like I do like this. I like when we can have the atmosphere or the attitude that Lord, we're here now &gt;&gt; and Lord, whatever you want to do, that's what we'll do. Amen. Amen. We're not going to have in our mind preconceived, hey, it's certain time. Forget that. Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll be here all night. We'll be here all night if God wants. Amen. &gt;&gt; But just go until the Holy Spirit is done because I'm here to tell you it's about him doing something. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go before I Amen. Amen. All right. in uh Hebrews 10. Hebrews 10 and verse 19. Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus. Amen. And then over in first Corinthians, I believe it is 1 Corinthians the 3r chapter and verse 21. 3:21. Therefore, let no man glory in men, for all things are yours. &gt;&gt; Whether Paul or Apollos or Cphus or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all are yours, and ye are Christ, and Christ is God's. May God add the blessing to the reading of the word. You can be seated. Amen. I begin to uh I'll just be honest with you. I begin to study and I really want to just title this with the help of the Lord entering the holiest by the blood. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Originally I had thought about u titling this why we are the happiest people on the earth. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know why? Because brother Brandham, he said, "A Christian, he does not have one worry in the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "I'm here to do nothing but to build the faith of the people just to get them built up to a place where it gets all the scare away from." We're trying our best to do that. The Christian doesn't have one worry. They should be the most freest, happiest in all the world. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, and I've said this before in the church. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU just feeling like saying, you know, I'm not one that should be or want to be, but I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many would say that with me? I am THE HAPPIEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'VE GOT THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST AND YOU ARE SAVED, FOLKS, YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT. HALLELUJAH. HOW MANY KNOWS THAT GOD ONE TIME wasn't even God? &gt;&gt; All right. WASN'T EVEN GOD. WAY BEFORE THE FIRST ANGEL was made. BEFORE THERE WAS any angels AT ALL, HE DWELT BY HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; HE WAS ALL BY HIMSELF. AND AS WE KNOW, THE PROPHET SAID, "GOD means an object of worship." &gt;&gt; AIN'T THAT RIGHT? GOD IS AN OBJECT WAS HAD NOTHING TO WORSHIP HIM. SO HE WASN'T EVEN GOD. NOT THAT he didn't exist. Amen. IF YOU WANT TO STRETCH YOUR MIND JUST A LITTLE, TRY TO THINK OF WHERE YOU MIGHT ASK, WELL, WHEN DID GOD START? HOW FAR BACK DID IT GO? &gt;&gt; HOW FAR BACK DID IT GO? &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY JESUS. HE ALWAYS WAS. &gt;&gt; HE ALWAYS WILL BE. &gt;&gt; HE IS. AND HE ALWAYS WILL BE. &gt;&gt; And everything centered around him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED WAS HE BEGAN TO CREATE ANGELS and the angels worshiped him. The saraphims all of heaven WORSHIPED HIM JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. GOD JUST KIND OF MADE IT REAL TO ME. I SAID, YOU KNOW, WE WONDER. WE THINK ABOUT THAT DIMENSION AND HOW THAT GOD WAS AND HOW THOSE ANGELS ARE THERE DAY AND NIGHT FLOPPING their wings saying holy, holy, HOLY, HOLY, AND ALL THAT THAT WAS AND ALL THE EONS OF TIME, HOW LONG IT'S BEEN SINCE THOSE ANGELS ARE THERE WORSHIPING HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE THINK ABOUT THAT. BUT YOU KNOW, I GOT A REVELATION GOD SHOWED ME. HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, AMEN. WE HAVE TO WONDER THAT, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO WONDER BECAUSE ONE OF THESE DAYS, WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THAT WITH THEM. AMEN. FOR THE EONS OF TIME THAT IS TO COME. WE'RE GOING TO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE WITH GOD FOR THE EONS UPON EONS OF TIME. &gt;&gt; Can't say time because there won't be no time. &gt;&gt; But hallelujah. AREN'T YOU GLAD TO BE PART OF THAT? AMEN. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOW THAT GOD HAS A PLAN? HE'S GOT A PLAN. AMEN. AND TO BE A PART OF THAT PLAN should make us excited. &gt;&gt; We truly should be Amen. enthused. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the gospel. AMEN. WHEN THEY FIRST CAME, AMEN. THE GOSPEL WAS IT WAS tidings of great joy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Tidings of great joy. LET US BE SAD. &gt;&gt; NO. Come on. LET US BE GLAD AND REJOICE AND REJOICE. HOW MANY KNOW REJOICING AIN'T BEING QUIET? IT'S REJOICING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WELL, if you're going to be happy, you need to have something to be happy about. &gt;&gt; We don't just for anyhow. &gt;&gt; You got to have something to whoop about. &gt;&gt; That's right. You got to HAVE SOMETHING TO KICK ABOUT. &gt;&gt; HELLO. &gt;&gt; I just don't understand WHY PEOPLE WANT TO BE CRITICAL of how emotional we got. &gt;&gt; I don't understand it. EVEN BROTHER BANNON COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEM GIRLS COULD BE OUT THERE DANCING. Ain't that right? Amen. HE SAYS, "MAYBE I HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH VICTORY IN MY LIFE." AMEN. MAYBE GOD NEEDS TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BATTLE, MAN. SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE VICTORY. SO YOU'LL SAY, "THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS." MAYBE THOSE FOLKS, AMEN. They just drooping around. &gt;&gt; They're more happy being sad than being happy. &gt;&gt; I don't know about YOU, BUT I'M HAPPY BEING HAPPY. &gt;&gt; We ought to be the happiest people. Hallelujah. Brother Bam said it this way. He says, "Listen, SO WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT? WHAT ARE YOU STEWING ABOUT? WHY ARE YOU GOING ALONG WITH A GREAT BIG FACE, big long face?" HE SAID, "LET'S LOOK UP AND GR. &gt;&gt; LET'S LOOK UP AND GRIN." AND NOT ONLY GRIN, but let's laugh. &gt;&gt; Let's laugh. AMEN. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT LET'S LIFT UP HOLY HANDS AND GIVE PRAISE TO HIS NAME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; If I stay on course tomorrow morning, we're going to preach on giving God his due. &gt;&gt; Give him glory. Give God give the Lord. Let him have give him the glory &gt;&gt; that's due to his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. God is good. Now, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you ready to eat? &gt;&gt; Are you hungry? &gt;&gt; I'm ready to eat. I've been eating good. &gt;&gt; I've been eating good. &gt;&gt; We're like that little fatted calf, ain't we? &gt;&gt; We're like that little fatted calf where the farmer wasn't so lazy and he gave him some food. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not babies anymore. That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm in a mess. We don't need to be babies anymore. &gt;&gt; We'll get into that. BUT LISTEN, WE GOT TO BE GROWN UP. &gt;&gt; LITTLE BABY, YOU GOT TO GIVE IT THE spoon and say, "Here, eat. Eat. Open up." All right. Look you up here. It's about what you GOT TO DO TO SOME PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU ALMOST GOT TO TRICK HIM INTO GETTING A BITE. I don't KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I DON'T LIKE TO JUST HAVE TO COME TO CHURCH. AMEN. I LIKE to be able to EAT IN MY CAR. I EAT AT HOME. I EAT EVERYWHERE. AND IT SHOWS. HOW MANY KNOWS WHEN YOU EAT MORE THAN WHAT YOU OUGHT TO, IT SHOWS? SHOWS. &gt;&gt; WOO. I HAD A WHOLE I'D RATHER BE A HAVE A CHURCH THAT'S ALL GOT A LITTLE WILDFIRE THAN A BUNCH OF ICICLES HANGING FROM THE CHANDELIERS. &gt;&gt; Brother B said the Pentecostals even used to lick their lips. Oh, taste and SEE THE LORD IS GOOD. AND I GO AROUND LICKING MY LIPS. THIS IS GOOD. OH, TASTE THAT THE LORD IS GOOD. &gt;&gt; How many believes that WHEN WE GET BESIDE OURSELVES, &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. It gets the presence of God comes down, &gt;&gt; it's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many is glad for the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; You know, we could take a whole sermon. I love the way Brother Andrew touched on it, but I'm here to tell you, we should be thankful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Give thanks. &gt;&gt; That's right. cuz he's worthy of thanks. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because of what he's done in our generation, &gt;&gt; we can't fathom. WE JUST HARDLY CAN'T FATHOM &gt;&gt; THE GOOD THINGS THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US. HOW GOOD WE REALLY HAVE IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So he makes this statement, brother Bamz. He says, "Footsteps, footsteps is victory." I'll tell you today, he says, "Let's trot on the lands that God give us. Divine healing, powers of God, everything. Coming into Christ is like going down to a great big arcade here, going into a variety store. And you look all around and there's everything in there. The shelves are full of nice pretty things. &gt;&gt; And everything that I LIKE. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOW THAT GOD KNOWS JUST WHAT YOU LIKE? &gt;&gt; He knew that you would LOVE MALACHI 4. HE KNEW THAT YOU WOULD LOVE THE VINDICATION OF AMEN. THEIR NAME IS FROM SO AND SO. IF I'VE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH, IF CHRIST DON'T COME, AMEN. YOU OUGHT TO GOT AIN'T GOT TO BELIEVE ME. BUT IF HE DOES, THEN HE THUS SAYAITH THE LORD. HOW MANY MEAN WE GOT? THUS SAYAITH THE LORD. &gt;&gt; Good things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So he says it this way. And listen, I part partly uh pulled in this uh this scripture here where he says, you know, whether it's the world or whether it's life or whether it's death. Uh whoa. We could stop there, couldn't we? Whether it's life OR EVEN DEATH. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE DEATH is ours? &gt;&gt; WE DON'T FEAR DEATH ANYMORE. WHAT IS IT? IT'S A HORSE AND BUGGY THAT'S GOING TO CARRY US OVER. PAUL SAID, "OH, DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STAIN? OH, GRAVE, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY?" &gt;&gt; AMEN. GIVE ME SOME OF THAT OFF OF THE SHELF. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE IT'S A VARIETY STORE? AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS WEEKEND. IS THAT ALL RIGHT? &gt;&gt; We're going to GET LADDERS. WE'RE GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS VARIETY STORE. WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT WE GOT. &gt;&gt; Tell me what I got. &gt;&gt; WOO. HALLELUJAH. And he talks about, you know, um if you had a variety store with all these little gizmos, this that or the other. Another place he says right down there off the next next one, he says the trouble with Christians today is they don't realize what is provided for them. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Come on, preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I want to go back before the foundation of the world again. Amen. In God's thinking, and we will here in a minute. All right. They don't realize what they got. Many people doesn't realize the great glories and powers that's provided for them. Coming into Christ is like a walking into arcade down here, a great department store. He says it. He calls it a department store. And of course, WE CAN WE CAN JUST IMAGINE a little bit of of our own and thinking about a DEPARTMENT STORE. FOR US HUNTERS, &gt;&gt; it would be Cabelas. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Can you imagine somebody say, "You inherit Cabelas. THE DOORS ARE LOCKED. HERE'S the key. EVERYTHING IN THERE IS YOURS." &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; OH, we might have to. You'd be frowning, huh? &gt;&gt; No. You'd say, "Hey, GIVE ME THE KEY. GIVE ME THE KEY." GOD. &gt;&gt; AND YOU'D GO IN THERE AND EVERY GUN THAT YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE, EVERY BOAT YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE, EVERY FISHING POLE YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE, EVERYTHING IS IN THERE AND IT'S PROVIDED FOR. IT'S ALL YOURS. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE THIS IS ALL OURS? AMEN. IT'S MINE. FROM TIMBER TO TIMBER, IT'S MINE. MINE. MINE. MINE. YES. JESUS IS MINE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY I'M THE HAPPIEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. IF THAT DON'T GIVE YOU JOY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You We CAN ONLY TOUCH ON SOME OF THE THINGS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. That's right. A great department store. Amen. I think Sister Katie was saved talking about that department store for women's clothes in Pennsylvania somewhere. She liked to go back there, huh? Women's clothes just massive. Your eyes would pop up. Oh, yeah. I like that dress. I like this. I I TELL YOU WHAT, I LIKE THIS OUTFIT AND I LIKE THAT OUTFIT. MY YOU WOULD HAVE YOU A TIME, wouldn't you? Amen. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'RE doing tonight. And tomorrow morning, we're in this department store and we're just looking at what ours. &gt;&gt; Look at what's mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. We go on this department store and we look we look over here on the shelf and what do we find? We find a book. We the book department. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; You got the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you got the fulfillment of the Bible. You got the seven seals. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You got the church age book. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. AND WE WE HAVE FOUND OUT. HOW MANY KNOWS? WE HAVE FOUND OUT. WE DON'T HAVE TO WONDER WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM. WE DON'T HAVE TO WONDER WHAT THE PLAN OF GOD IS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WONDER ALL OF THOSE THINGS. AMEN. IT WAS THE THAT PART OF GOD'S MIND. AMEN. WHEN YOU OPEN THAT BOOK, YOU REALIZE THAT EVEN GOD WASN'T EVEN GOD ONE TIME. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND THEN HE CREATED ANGELS, DID ALL OF THESE THINGS. AMEN. CREATED ANGELS. AND then there was trouble in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows heaven had some trouble? &gt;&gt; Now, let's just go back a little bit. Even before him, before the first star was created, before anything that was made, before the foundation of the world, how many knows that he had you in his &gt;&gt; mind? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He had he had you in his mind. And we'll get into the trouble in heaven in the middle a little a little bit because we want to bring in how that God had something in his mind and we know what he had in his mind. He said herein is set forth the love of God. He desired and love a family of his own. How many appreciate your family? &gt;&gt; See that's what God had in mind. Amen. Before anything ever started, he wanted a family. He wanted a wife. &gt;&gt; He wanted children, SONS AND DAUGHTERS LIKE HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW MANY KNOWS THAT'S GOD'S PURPOSE TONIGHT? AMEN. IS TO BRING his children, Amen, TO THE AGE OF ACCOUNT OR THE OF MATURITY. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The age of maturity. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Oh my. SO HE SAYS, "SON'S LIKE HIMSELF. THEREFORE, BEFORE HIM LIES ALL OF mankind as one lump of clay, and out of that same lump of clay, he will now make vessels of unto honor and unto dishonor. The choosing will be his own choosing. &gt;&gt; How many knows HE CHOOSE YOU LONG BEFORE YOU CHOSE HIM? &gt;&gt; He's the one that chose you. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, you're not a Christian. You're not GOING TO MISS. SHUT UP. GOD CHOSE ME. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE GAVE HIS ONLY SON. AMEN. SO, HOW CAN YOU LAY ANYTHING AT THE CHARGE OF GOD'S ELECT? &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD THAT JUSTIFIES. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD THAT SANCTIFIES. IT'S GOD THAT FILLS WITH THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I'm going to put you out of the message. Go ahead and try. &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T BRING ME IN AND YOU CAN'T PUT ME OUT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY WE TELL THE DEVIL TOO EVERY TIME HE TRIES AND GETS YOU TO FALL. DEVIL, YOU DIDN'T BRING ME IN. AMEN. AND YOU CAN'T TAKE ME OUT. THERE'S NOTHING CAN SEPARATE ME FROM THE LOVE OF GOD. NOT TRIBULATION, NOT DISTRESS. AIN'T NOTHING CAN SEPARATE US FROM THE LOVE OF GOD. HEY, &gt;&gt; but says when a believer has an ABSOLUTE EXPERIENCE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE DESERT AND A PREACHER AIN'T SUPPOSED TO PREACH, YOU CAN'T CALL YOURSELF A CHRISTIAN UNTIL YOU HAVE MET GOD ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE DESERT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE WHEN THAT HAPPENS, &gt;&gt; SIR, &gt;&gt; WHEN THAT HAPPENS, &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT ENOUGH IMPS, NOT ENOUGH DEVILS IN HELL TO EVER TAKE IT FROM YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M ALMOST 64. I GOT SAVED AT 20. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, IT WASN'T ME THAT HELD ME. IT WAS GOD THAT HELD ME. &gt;&gt; HE HAS BROUGHT US SAFE THUS FAR. I AIN'T WORRIED ABOUT MAKING IT. I ALREADY MADE IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I ALREADY MADE IT. I ALREADY HAVE A GLORIFIED BODY. I'VE GOT A WAITING FOR ME. THAT'S WHAT I FIND IN GOD'S GREAT STORE, A THEOPHONY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's why we ought to be the happiest people. &gt;&gt; You ain't got nothing to be scared of. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ain't God good? You see folks that's home. ALL MY LIFE YOU HAVE been faithful. &gt;&gt; All my life you have been good. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; With every breath barely have any. WITH EVERY BREATH THAT I AM ABLE, I WILL SING OF THE GOODNESS OF GOD. I WILL SHOUT ABOUT THE GOODNESS OF GOD. HE'S BEEN SO GOOD TO ME. HE'S HELD ME. HE PICKED ME UP WHEN I WAS DOWN. HE HEALED ME WHEN I WAS SICK. HE SAVED MY SOUL WHEN I WAS LOST. HE FILLED ME WITH THE HOLY Ghost when I need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Y'all going to kill me. You were right. That's all right. If I hard have a heart attack, you remember I died happy. I died happy. &gt;&gt; We don't realize, I read one place, Brother Bram says, if this would all come down on us all at once, the rapture would almost take place. where we're not bringing it all at once, but we're eating a little this and a little that. &gt;&gt; WHO KNOWS? MAYBE BEFORE THE CHURCH IS OVER, THE RAPTURE TAKE PLACE. &gt;&gt; HOW many is looking for? We've had the woman IN PURPLE. WE'VE HAD THE AMERICAN POPE. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "AFTER THAT PURPLE WOMAN, THE NEXT THING HE'S FIRE, RUSSIA'S GETTING RAMPED UP. THEY'RE GETTING READY TO SHOOT SOMEBODY." &gt;&gt; HELLO. But I ain't GOING TO BE ME CUZ THAT THAT ROCKET IS IN THE SKY. I DON'T CARE IF I SEE IT WITH MINE. BROTHER BRANDON SAID BEFORE IT BREAKS, THE BRIDE WILL BE GONE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I LIKE. THAT'S MY PROMISE. &gt;&gt; That's part of the varieties. That's God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So then God created all those angels. Heaven was all in good harmony. &gt;&gt; Everything was going good. &gt;&gt; Then all of a sudden something happened, didn't it? Somebody let heaven become common to him. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What' I do with my glasses? &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; Got to watch that sneaky pulpit. It lies from you. That's all right. I think I've had him there and said, "Where's that?" Or I've had I've had one here and put another one here. Done all kinds of stuff. Never know what you're going to do. But amen. So the devil, we know Satan, he was God's right- hand man, wasn't he? &gt;&gt; God's right hand man. And all of a sudden he become let heaven become common. &gt;&gt; How many knows that's we got to warn we got to be careful of that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We got to be careful that this message the word of God doesn't become common. &gt;&gt; And then it begin to no doubt murmur and then begin to gossip. &gt;&gt; How many know that's why brother Bram says the poison acids. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come from the spit of the devil. When you've got uh gossiping and discontent, &gt;&gt; discontentment, boy, is it not a good thing? &gt;&gt; Complaining. God hates complaining. &gt;&gt; God hates murmuring. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he had it up there first. &gt;&gt; Amen. He hates WHEN SOMEBODY CAUSES DIVISION IN THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HE HATES IT. WHY? CUZ HE HAD A DIVISION UP THERE. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? AND SATAN TOOK TWOTHIRDS OF THE ANGELS. AMEN. AND WHEN NATHAN AND KORA WHEN THEY BEGIN TO SPEAK AGAINST MOSES AND SAY LIKE THE DEVIL DID UP IN HEAVEN, GOD, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY HOLY ONE. WE WANT SOME OF THE WORSHIP, TOO. &gt;&gt; WE WANT SOME OF THIS GREATNESS AND HIS GLORY, TOO. AND THAT'S WHAT NATHAN SAYS. GOD, GOD DIDN'T LIKE IT SO WELL THAT HE HAD MOSES TO SEPARATE HIM. SAID, "ALL THAT'S ON OUR SIDE, COME ON OVER." &gt;&gt; IT'S TOUGH WHEN the pastor has to DO THAT SOMETIME. AND ALL THAT'S ON GOD'S SIDES, COME ON. &gt;&gt; HELLO. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD HATED IT SO BAD, HE CRACKED THE EARTH OPEN. AMEN. AND THEY WENT SWALLOWED A HOLE DOWN INTO HELL, SO TO SPEAK, as the people listen. So, Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; MY POINT IS THIS. GOD WANTS CHILDREN. HE WANTS SONS AND DAUGHTERS LIKE HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; And we all ALREADY KNOW THAT IN THE WHOLE PROGRAM OF GOD, GOD WANTED TO DISPLAY HIMSELF. HE WANTED TO BE A SAVIOR. HE WANTED TO BE A HEALER. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he couldn't do it if we didn't get lost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; OH, I'M SO GLAD THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW BAD THINGS ARE. IT DON'T MATTER IF YOU ARE AMEN STRICKEN WITH CANCER OR WHATEVER IT IS. AMEN. GOD IS GREATER. &gt;&gt; GOD IS GREATER. AMEN. THERE'S A PLAN. GOD HAS GOT A PLAN IN IT ALL. AND SO HE ALLOWED US TO GET INTO THIS PLACE THROUGH THE FIRST ADAM. &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? THROUGH THE FIRST ADAM, HE ALLOWED TO COME INTO THE FALL AND EVERYTHING. BUT PRAISE BE TO GOD FOR THE SECOND ADAM. HOW MANY BELIEVE WHEN SECOND ADAM COME AND WHEN HE WAS ON CALVARY, &gt;&gt; GOD HAD THAT IN HIS MIND BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AMEN. WHEN HE SAID, "IT IS FINISHED," IT WAS FINISHED. &gt;&gt; But B said, "IF JESUS WAS HERE IN MY SUIT RIGHT NOW AND YOU WANTED to be healed, he couldn't heal you." That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; IS THAT WHAT HE SAID? &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. HE COULDN'T HEAL. HE WOULD TELL YOU, "I ALREADY DID. I already did. It's already done. &gt;&gt; MY WIFE, BROTHER, WE GOT TO SAY IT'S ALREADY DONE. AND YOU CAN'T JUST SAY, "WELL, I hope it will, but I'm not going to tell nobody that I'm healed." &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. You've got TO CONFESS IT WITH YOUR MOUTH PUBLICLY, BROTHER. TELL THEM, "WELL, I BELIEVE I'M HEALED." &gt;&gt; GOD IS MY HEALER. GOD IS MY SAVIOR. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE SEEKING THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. SAY, "I'VE GOT THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST." GOD'S GIVEN IT TO ME. IT'S RIGHTFULLY MINE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE RIGHTEOUS, THEY TAKE IT BY FORCE. &gt;&gt; TAKE IT BY FORCE. &gt;&gt; Take it. DON'T ASK THE DEVIL. THE DEVIL IS absolutely been stripped of ALL OF HIS POWER, ALL OF HIS AUTHORITY. HE CAN'T HAVE YOUR JOY. HE CAN'T HAVE YOUR PEACE. AMEN. IF HE'S TAKEN IT FROM YOU, YOU GOT TO GO AND TAKE IT BACK. COME ON. &gt;&gt; What does it THE DEVIL? BUT R SAYS FAITH. AMEN. IT'S NOT SOME meek thing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; IT'S BARELY. IT BEATS DOWN. DEVIL, I'MMA BEAT you down. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Beat him down. Well, that's usually about time we close. Y'all ready to close? &gt;&gt; It goes fast when you're having a good time, don't it? &gt;&gt; That's right. It goes fast. No. But how many is thankful &gt;&gt; that this message that God brought us in this generation? How many knows that God before the foundation of the world in the Old Testament, he knew that we would get in this condition? &gt;&gt; And that's WHY HE PUT IN MALACHI 4. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Can we go to a couple places like that? Would that be all right? I love this. Malachi 4 right quick if I can find it right here. I love these scriptures. Behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud and all that do wickedly shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up, says the Lord of hosts. How many knows where at that day? &gt;&gt; And it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you &gt;&gt; who FEAR MY NAME, SHALL THE SON OF RIGHTEOUSNESS ARISE &gt;&gt; WITH HEALING. &gt;&gt; Not just through BROTHER BRANDON, BUT HEALING TODAY. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE HE'S A HEALER TODAY? &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO DECLARE, AND WE LOVE IT, THAT GOD IS NOT DEAD. HE NEVER DID DIE. HE WENT ON THE CROSS, BUT THAT WAS HIS SON. AMEN. BUT HE'S NOT DEAD. HE'S ALIVE FOREVER MORE. &gt;&gt; THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. THAT EXCITES US. So the SON OF RIGHTEOUSNESS ARRIVED WITH HEALING IN HIS WINGS. &gt;&gt; Oh man. Over in Ephesians, he says he ascended. He that ascended also descended far above the heavens that he might fill all things. And he gave some apostles and some prophets, evangelists, some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints, for the working of the ministry, FOR THE EDIFYING OF THE BODY OF CHRIST TILL WE ALL COME into the unity of the faith AND OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE son of God AND TO A PERFECT MAN. HOW MANY IS DESIRING TO BE WHAT GOD THOUGHT OF YOU &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; LISTEN PEOPLE, WE'VE GOT A RESTORED WORD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS RESTORED THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT DON'T mean you've been restored. But I want YOU TO KNOW IF YOU'LL TAKE THOSE WORDS, IF YOU'LL TAKE PAUL A PRISONER, THE STATURE OF A PERFECT MAN. AMEN. THE GREATEST BATTLE EVER FOUGHT. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S THE BRIDE'S DRESS WEAR? IT'S TIME TO GET OFF THE BOOKS AND ENTER THE HEART. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE A I DON'T WANT TO BE A SHOULD BE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T want to be a wannabe. I want TO BE A BE. I AM. &gt;&gt; I AM WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NO NEED TO BE DESIRING THOSE THINGS. THAT'S YOURS. &gt;&gt; You know, here's a pretty good revelation that I've said about that. Christ has already done it. Brother preached a message called he cares. Do you care? &gt;&gt; In that message, he says he cared. Now he's waiting for you to care. &gt;&gt; He said he makes a statement, but you got to care first. &gt;&gt; He cared.

So he says, he says that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and FRO AND CARRIED ABOUT with every wind OF DOCTRINE BY THE SLIGHT OF men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Not to BE TOSSED ABOUT.

AMEN. That was at a HOSPITAL DYING AND SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS OKAY. Remember that? Smoking a cigarette and everything else. Amen. And she said to him that that you know it's I just I I love the LORD BUT I JUST FIND IT SO HARD TO SERVE GOD. AND BROTHER B SAYS THAT OUGHT TO BE THAT WAY. I MEAN, IT MEANS IT OUGHT TO BE HARD TO COME TO CHURCH. IT OUGHT TO BE HARD FOR US. AMEN. TO SERVE GOD, TO WORSHIP HIM. NO. NO. HE SAYS THE PEOPLE ARE TOSSED ABOUT.

IT DON'T MATTER WHAT SOMEBODY DOES, YOU'LL NEVER GET THAT LITTLE BITTERNESS IN MY HEART. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; NO root of bitterness in here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let me uh go back for just a minute on this thought of letting things become common to you. Because we know a lot of the mysteries. Is that right? &gt;&gt; We know a lot of the mysteries. We hear things so much. Let me just Can I just put it the way Brother Brandon put it? You know, I always tell my church, you know, it's it's one thing for me to say something, but when I read this, it's vindicated. &gt;&gt; Amen. To me, it's it's it's more than what I would say. That's why I like to read it. &gt;&gt; Tell me the story again. How many love the stories? &gt;&gt; So here's the story. Brother Bam says a long time. He says some time ago a man went uh was down by the sea went to the seaside. He was going over there to rest. He wanted to refresh himself. He loved the thought of to hearing those seagulls that flew over the water to skip down there and those waves coming in roared and busted in the air. He wanted to smell that salt water. He says, "It'll be such a rest to live by the so seashore a while. I just want to rest. I want to live by the seashore and see the sea of things and so what it has to offer. The blue sky reflect from the sky out of the water. The foam and so forth boil up." And he said, "If I can just look at that and hear that." And on his road down to the seashore, he met a man coming. He was an old salt and the old sailor from the sea. He says, "Where goest thou?" He said, "I'm go down to Seashore to enjoy the goodness of the sea." The old soul said, "I don't see nothing better good about it. The waters are just waters. The sky is just sky. The golf skull is just a a bird." You see, he had seen it so much until it become common to him. It wasn't thrilling to him anymore. &gt;&gt; That's what's the matter with people. He says, "YOU'VE SEEN THE GOODNESS AND THE MIRACLES AND THE DIVINE THINGS, AMEN, OF GOD, MOVING AND WORKING UNTIL IT BECOMES COMMON TO YOU. YOU DON'T NOTICE IT ANYMORE. AMEN. I've noticed in the meetings where THE LORD UNDER DISCERNMENT SPEAK RIGHT OUT IN THE AUDIENCE AS HE DID WHEN HE WALKED THE SHORES of Galilee and promised he said he would do it AGAIN AND PEOPLE THE FIRST TIME THEY SAY, "OH WOW, WAS THAT EVER A GOOD SERVICE." Oh man, that's got to be the Lord. AND THE NEXT TIME, WELL, I guess it's all right. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now listen to this. It's common. It's passed over. You don't notice it anymore. The eyes of your understanding, your heart becomes closed to it. THE THRILL, THE BLESSEDNESS OF KNOWING, THE RISEN LORD JESUS STANDING IN OUR MIDST SHOULD SEND EVERY SOUL TO THE HEIGHTS BEYOND ANYTHING THIS WORLD COULD EVER THRILL. IT SHOULD DO SOMETHING FOR YOU. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETIMES YOU'LL HEAR ANOINTED PREACHERS, YOUR PASTOR, BROTHER RON, BROTHER ANDREW, WHOEVER, OUR BROTHERS COME UP HERE. AMEN. AND YOU'LL HEAR THAT ANOINTED PREACHING. WE JUST SAID, "WELL, he's doing pretty good, I guess. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to be like that little old lady THAT COME OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS. AMEN. WENT TO A BAPTIST CHURCH AND THE PREACHER SAYS, YOU KNOW, JESUS CHRIST CAME TO SAVE SINNERS AND SHE WENT, &gt;&gt; "HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY I PREACH IT, BROTHER. WHY?" AMEN. THE AMAZING STORY OF GRACE. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, BROTHER BAPTIST. WHEN YOU HEAR ME, WHEN I'M OVER THERE WAY DOWN IN THE HOLLER SOMEWHERE, &gt;&gt; ISN'T THAT RIGHT? WHEN YOU HEAR SOMEBODY SINGING, "AMAZING GRACE, HOW SWEET THE SOUND THAT SAVED THE RICH. OH, BROTHER BANNON MADE IT." WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE SINGING, "OH, THE SEVEN SEALS OF GREAT MISERY." NO, WE'RE GOING TO SING ABOUT THE GRACE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you got me for a sake, &gt;&gt; all right, we got a few people that come from where I come from. And this is my word to you. If you can see this message, &gt;&gt; if you can believe that God sent a prophet, &gt;&gt; you ought to give God praise. &gt;&gt; CUZ JESUS SAID, "THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE, THE PHARISEES, THEY HAVE EYES, BUT THEY SEE NOT. THEY HAVE EARS, BUT THEY HEAR NOT. BUT BLESSED ARE YOUR EYES. BLESSED ARE YOUR EARS, BECAUSE THEY CAN RECEIVE THE THINGS OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. HOW MANY'S BLESSED? WE'RE ALL blessed because we can see the THINGS OF GOD. GOD HAS OPENED OUR EYES. WE SAY, "THANK YOU, JESUS. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 10,000 YEARS FROM NOW, I'M GOING TO BE DANCING. I'M GOING TO BE SHOUTING. I'M GOING TO BE SAYING, "THANK YOU, LORD." It was amazing. AMAZING. AMAZING THAT HE THOUGHT OF ME BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; Chose me BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Never let the simple gospel, &gt;&gt; the simple message of grace and faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't let it become common. &gt;&gt; No, it's precious. &gt;&gt; It's precious. &gt;&gt; How many believe faith is precious? &gt;&gt; You see, you are saved by grace. &gt;&gt; But how? But how? Through faith. &gt;&gt; Through faith. And that not what you mustered up, not what you tried, BUT THE BIBLE SAYS IN FACT THAT BY THE GIFT OF GOD, &gt;&gt; THAT FAITH THAT WAS GIVEN YOU TO BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; For your grace, &gt;&gt; and it is a gift of God &gt;&gt; for you to believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Others are happy. Others are happy DRINKING FROM A STAGNATED FOUNTAIN. THEY'RE HAPPY DRINKING FROM A MAN-MADE SYSTEM. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE HAPPY WITH WIGGLE TAILS IN IT. THEY'RE HAPPY WITH GREEN MOSS EVERYWHERE. BUT NOT ME. &gt;&gt; NOT YOU. WHEN THE PREACHER comes up here, YOU WANT SOMETHING FRESH. YOU WANT THE FRESH GOOD WORD OF GOD. BUBBLING UP. BUBBLING UP. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; This day, this scripture &gt;&gt; is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tried it again, didn't it? Oh my &gt;&gt; hallelujah. What's fulfilled, brother Raher? What's fulfilled? Well to you that's just coming out. Revelations 18 is fulfilled for you. And after these things, I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory. &gt;&gt; How many believe this? Isaiah 6, HE SAYS, "RISE AND SHINE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR THY LIGHT IS COME. Darkness has covered THE EARTH AND GROSS DARKNESS THE PEOPLE. AMEN. But not for you. &gt;&gt; For you, IT'S GOOD MORNING. IT'S SHALOM TIME. &gt;&gt; IT'S RISE AND SHINE. HOW MANY BELIEVE THE LONG OH, don't get me going. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY ELSE, EVERY OTHER GENERATION, IT BECOME COMMON. AMEN. AND THEY GET THEY GET MURMURING AND COMPLAIN. AMEN. AND THEY DIE SPIRITUALLY. &gt;&gt; BUT BROTHER B SAID, "THIS BRIDE IN THIS HOUR, THIS CHURCH WILL NOT DIE. &gt;&gt; I FEEL IT, BROTHER. I feel IT IN MY BONES." AMEN. IT'S NOT ME YET. THAT SEED KEEPING ME ALIVE. HOW MANY KNOW THAT'S WHY YOU COME? &gt;&gt; There's something pulling. &gt;&gt; There's something pulling. &gt;&gt; YOUR THEOPHONY IS CALLING. &gt;&gt; HEAVEN IS CALLING TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT CALLS TO US &gt;&gt; AND WE CALL TO IT. &gt;&gt; EVEN SO, LORD. &gt;&gt; COME. &gt;&gt; Even so. Come. Lord Jesus. We used to huff and puff for the devil, right? Well, guess what? Let's huff and puff and dance a little for God. It don't hurt nothing. Well, I like what he said. I used to dance for the devil. I didn't really know how to dance, but I try to dance. Well, if I made a FOOL FOR THE DEVIL, &gt;&gt; MAYBE I ACT A LITTLE FOOLISH FOR IT NOW. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Thank you, Jesus. THANK YOU, JESUS. LET EVERYTHING THAT HAS BREATH PRAISE THE LORD. PRAISE THE LORD. LET THE SUN AND the moon and everything that draws breath praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I won't have to do cardio tomorrow. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christians ought to go around with a long face. all sad. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "Did you ever meet somebody that went into the Holies of Holies?" &gt;&gt; It can be a cloudy day. It can be trials, tribulation, &gt;&gt; and all those things, but yet they're sweet and kind and loving. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they never HAVE TO GO TO CHURCH TO GET FED. &gt;&gt; HUH? &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE NEXT REVIVAL &gt;&gt; TO GET REVIVED. &gt;&gt; That's right. COME ON. &gt;&gt; HELLO. D SAYS THEY'RE ALWAYS FED UP. &gt;&gt; How many wants to be fed up? &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO FULL. &gt;&gt; OH MAN, I can. You can discern when somebody's had enough to eat. Like that fatted calf, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That fatted calf when he come out there, Brother Bam says it went to leaping and jumping. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That skinny calf. Look through the rail. Look through the finish. &gt;&gt; SUCH FANATISM. &gt;&gt; Such fanatism. &gt;&gt; They're just worked up. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say this yet. People think we're just emotional. THEY RELY ON ANYMORE. I DON'T RELY ON PROMOTION FOR MY MY MY SALVATION. IT AIN'T ABOUT RELYING ON THAT. IT'S ABOUT REJOICING IN THE LORD. AMEN. GIVING HIM PRAISE &gt;&gt; FOR WHAT HE'S DONE FOR ME. &gt;&gt; WE ALREADY KNOW. DOESN'T MAKE YOU SAVED. Not what it's about. &gt;&gt; That's right. But you might AS WELL GET THE BACK HOLE OUT. Dig it about 6 foot hole. IF YOU AIN'T GOT NO motion with your religion, &gt;&gt; put her down in there. &gt;&gt; Bury your religion. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; CUZ I CAN'T READ THIS. LIKE THAT OLD MAN UP IN THE ATTIC. I CAN'T READ THIS, BUT MY GRANDKIDS want me to be quiet. I SAY, "PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; I FOUND THE OCEAN WHERE IT'S SO DOWN AND SO DEEP, THEY CAN'T FIND THE BOTTOM OF IT." &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Praise the Lord. Let me finish the scripture and I can tell we're just going to have to pick up and go on. I don't think I've looked hardly on any of these. Just a few notes. &gt;&gt; You know, that's when the Holy Spirit really comes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I like when he comes and he just stops you at the second bird. Word. Not bird. It's a word. Yeah. I guess y'all done figured out I'm just a country boy. &gt;&gt; I'm one of y'all, right? &gt;&gt; That's right. We love you. Love Brother Ron. And they love the brothers. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to express to your group, your wife, so to speak, my love for the Lord Jesus Christ. That's all I want to do is tell you how much I love him with all my heart, with all my soul, WITH ALL MY STRENGTH. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT WAS THE FIRST COMMANDMENT AND he never could do it? A lot of people don't do it. But how MANY BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THE CHURCH IS COMING TO? AMEN. IT'S A LOVE AFFAIR. WE LIVE HIM MORE THAN ANY WE LOVE HIM MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD. WITH ALL OF OUR HEART, ALL OF OUR MIND, ALL OF OUR SOUL, ALL OF OUR STRENGTH. WE LOVE HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And uh and he cried, HIS ANGEL DID, MIGHTILY WITH A STRONG VOICE, SAYING, "The Pentecostals are dead, the Methodists are dead, the Baptists are dead." I MEAN, THOSE HE DECLARED, "THOSE CHURCHES ARE DEAD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE REJECTED THE VERY ONE THAT THEY CAME TO BELIEVE 2,000 YEARS AGO. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE COME HERE AND DOES THE SAME THING, THEY REJECT HIM. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE CHRIST. NO, YOU REJECT HIM WHEN HE COMES AND DOES THE VERY SAME THINGS. &gt;&gt; HAS HIS PICTURE TAKEN AND EVERYTHING ELSE. &gt;&gt; AIN'T THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; WHOA. I SAY WOE TO PEOPLE THAT GET CAUGHT UP in not believing that the prophet is the prophet anymore. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS ONCE YOU'RE ENLIGHTENED AND HAVE TASTED OF IT AND YOU TURN AWAY, HE SAYS, "BROTHER BAM SAYS YOU'RE GONE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GONE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO MORE REMISSION FOR SUCH SINS." &gt;&gt; HOW MANY GLAD THAT GOD KEEPS YOU? &gt;&gt; WE AIN'T GOT AN EXPERIENCE ON OUR FLESH AND IN OUR SPIRIT. THAT'S THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT CAN GO. BUT NO, THE ONES THAT'S IN THE SOUTH, YOU CAN'T BE LOST. &gt;&gt; NO, you cannot disbelieve God's word. &gt;&gt; I want to get to the verse here for people JUST COMING OUT. MAN, BABYLON THE GREAT IS FALLEN IS FALLEN and has become the habitation of devils. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Bam said, "You have hateful spirits and the hole OF EVERY FOUL SPIRIT, THE CAGE of every unclean and hateful bird. &gt;&gt; All the nations have drunk of putting their own interpretation, their own ideas &gt;&gt; with the word of God. &gt;&gt; You could do that in days past and God would weaken your ignorance. But once the pure word is restored, you can't do that anymore. Once you know the revelation OF WATER BAPTISM THAT NOBODY WAS BAPTIZED IN THE TITLES THEY ALWAYS USE THE NAME. YOU DON'T HAVE TO revel have to have a revelation for that. &gt;&gt; IT'S AS PLAIN AS THE DAY. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU WILLFULLY TURN FROM THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; You better watch out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her. The merchants of the earth have waxed rich through abundance of her delicacies. And I heard another angel, another voice FROM HEAVEN SCREAMING, "COME OUT! GET OUT OF THERE BEFORE YOU CATCHING THE MARK OF THE BEAST." &gt;&gt; IT'S A MARK OF THE BEAST. COME OUT. &gt;&gt; You're looking at a COME OUT PERSON. I'M LOOKING AT A COME OUT CROWD THAT HAS COME OUT OF THAT DENOMINATIONAL SYSTEM. HURRY, HURRY. QUICKLY, QUICKLY. GET OUT OF THERE FAST. come &gt;&gt; and become his bride. &gt;&gt; How many wants to become his bride? &gt;&gt; I'm going to make a long story short. I believe that this message was sent to get a bride ready. &gt;&gt; Probably God said, "I'm dressing the bride." &gt;&gt; Wasn't he dressing the bride? How many believes it's the word that dresses &gt;&gt; the bride? &gt;&gt; He talked about how filthy she is. How she's committed fornications. She don't care what the word of God says. My church teaches different fornication. &gt;&gt; My church teaches don't teach that. Well, does the Bible say it? And if it does, fornication. &gt;&gt; God has a right to put you away. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU THAT HAS RECEIVED IT. All right. &gt;&gt; Can I give you some news? You that have received it. &gt;&gt; I love this quote. &gt;&gt; THIS IS MY MESSAGE TO CHURCH now as we go off the air. HE SAYS, "IF YOU'RE STANDING, YOU'RE STANDING ON GOD'S WORD AND WITH GOD'S WORD EVERY AMEN." &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT AS WE GO ON, WE HAVE TO SAY, "GOD, TAKE ALL DOUBT OUT OF MY LIFE." &gt;&gt; LORD, THIS DOESN'T LINE UP WITH THE MESSAGE. TAKE IT OUT. THAT DON'T LINE UP WITH THE MESSAGE. TAKE IT OUT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER REALLY ENTITLED TO THE TOKEN UNTIL YOU COME TO FULL OBEDIENCE TO THE WORD OF GOD. WE'LL NEVER BE 100% BLESSED UNTIL YOU YIELD COMPLETELY TO THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; OH, I SAY THIS. AMEN. GOD HELP US. I believe THAT GOD THROUGH A PROPHET OF BROTHER BRANDHAM BROUGHT A SON OF GOD TO MATURITY. &gt;&gt; SO MUCH SO HE COULD TELL DIDN'T TELL HIM what to say. TELL THAT YOUNG COUPLE OUT THERE THAT'S BASICALLY MAKING LOVE ON THE FRONT PEW. TELL THEM WHATEVER YOU SAY TO THEM, IT'LL BE THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And what did he say? You know, as an asan as fire was, how many know he could have spoken death to him? &gt;&gt; They could have dropped that. &gt;&gt; But no, he had Christ's spirit on the inside. He says, "I forgive you for that." And he said the right word. God could trust him with speaking to the storm. He could talk to the bull, the hornets, speak the word. I don't know about you, Lord. Help me to come to maturity to where my things when things come up no matter what the situation is you can say like Billy Paul about his dad the one thing about him he could control every situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right I'm reading this to you. Praise the Lord. So he says &gt;&gt; thank you. Amen. This is my message to you. Resting. Amen. You're every amen, EVERY JOT, EVERY TIT. Where are you standing? I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU, PULL AWAY FROM THEM SHUCKS out there. You won't never get perfect out there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Get in here where you CAN GET RIPE &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE SUN. HOW MANY KNOW THE DEVIL AND HIS CHILDREN, THEY'RE GETTING RIPE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD AND HIS CHURCH, YOU, WE'RE GETTING RIPE. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GETTING READY. WE'VE GOT TO BE READY. &gt;&gt; And you listen, I can hear the COMBINE COMING. YOU'RE STANDING COMPLETE, JUSTIFIED AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU ARE THE PURE, VIRTUOUS, SINLESS BRIDE OF THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD. I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE IS TO DO. IT'S TO BRING US TO PENTEST 100% PURE AND SPOTLESS, &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; In closing, I want to say this. I want to tell you about somebody that came back from heaven to apologize. Somebody came back from heaven to apologize for some little thing they had done. You know who that was? Sister Hope. &gt;&gt; Remember his wife? Why did you call me back? Why did you call ME BACK IN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PLACE? BUT I want to tell you something. I want to tell you something. REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU TO GO GET THOSE STOCKINGS? And I didn't look it up, but it was two different kind of stockings. &gt;&gt; And he forgot what IT WAS AND HE GOT THE WRONG KIND. He says, "I never told you that that was the wrong kind." CAN YOU IMAGINE COMING BACK FROM HEAVEN and having that one little thing? &gt;&gt; Just want to make sure it's right. &gt;&gt; How many wants to be that way? So, God help me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stand with me this night if you will. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We won't have an altar call, but I do want to pray for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to search your heart. Close your eyes. Bow your head. Search your heart. Ask yourself, are you ready to go if he comes tonight yet? Have you still got things in your life that you know isn't right? You know you need to make them right and you want to be pure before God. You'd raise your hand and say, "Brother Ber, I'll be honest. I want to be right with God. I'm not just exactly where I want to be, &gt;&gt; but I want to be that much. I want to be that sensitive to everything that I do to make sure that it's right. God, help me never to complain, never to murmur. God don't like those things. He loves for you to be content. Like Paul says, I have learned whether I am full or whether I'm in in need. I have learned to be content. Having food and raignment, let us be content. Amen. You're content when you have Christ. If you have a roof over your head and shoes on your feet, let's pray. Lord Jesus, as our hands go up, Lord, and we come before you now and we ask, God, that you'll come down into our hearts and our souls, Lord, and Father, if we have taken something from the neighbor, our tool or so to speak, something small like that, Lord, and we just haven't made it right, God, we raise our hands and say, God, forgive us. If I've done wrong, I want to be right. I want to be your bride. I want to be the way that you want me to be, Lord, so that I don't have to worry. I don't have any fear. I don't have to have any condemnation in my heart. And so tonight I ask God that you'll touch every hand that has went up. Lord, may they go out those double doors different than what they have come in. Lord, Father, now we put God everything of our past in the sea of his forgetfulness. And we under put it under the blood and we ask you to forgive us. Make us better Christians for you. Amen. God bless you. I would like to ask you one more one more question if you would just a second on the music. One more question. 2025 is past, isn't it? &gt;&gt; A lot of us maybe have regrets. And there's this saying, isn't it, that you can't change the past. You can't change the past. I was praying about that. You can't change the past. But you know that ain't true. &gt;&gt; How many believe that's not true? &gt;&gt; That's not true. Because I'm telling you right now, as long as he's on the mercy seat, &gt;&gt; as long as HE'S ON THE MERCY SEAT AND YOU DROP THAT AND YOU ASK him to forgive you, &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING OF 2025, EVERYTHING YOU DONE WRONG, HOW MANY BELIEVE YOU CAN CHANGE THAT, YOU CAN ERASE THAT BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you, JESUS. Not only that, remember that 80year-old atheist brother Brandham led to the led to Christ with an apple. &gt;&gt; Amen. Led him to Christ with a apple. What what power tells that sap to go back down in that tree. Amen. And that man was an atheist. And he was 80 YEARS OF DEFYING GOD, SAYING THAT THEY WERE BARKING UP THE TREE. A LION DOG HE CALLED PREACHERS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; But 80 years of sin, 80 YEARS OF WRONGDOING. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE CONFESSED IT AND MAKE IT RIGHT, IT WAS ALL WASHED AWAY. &gt;&gt; When brother Ben WENT BEYOND THE CURTAIN OF TIME and he said a certain sister come up and hugged him and he said, "Remember that sister? Remember her?" "No, I don't remember her." He says, "You should. She was past 80 or 90 &gt;&gt; when you led her to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe God can erase all the past? &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, if you follow Christ, you have a word that your past, it's though you never done it in the FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; I LIKE THAT OFF THE SHELF. GET THAT OFF THE SHELF. I'LL TAKE THAT. I'LL ENJOY THAT. IT'S things that I like. THOSE ARE THE THINGS I LIKE. I CAN BE HAPPY. YOU CAN BE HAPPY. YOU OUGHT TO BE THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH OR IN THE UNIVERSE. &gt;&gt; God bless you richly. Isn't God good? &gt;&gt; Amen. All my life you have been faithful.

I know there's a selection of of the believers here in this corner about about my age that went to camps. I I sat over there and I just just cried my eyes out just thinking I saw I I just I know for any of us we saw a flashback tonight because the same message that stirred Brother Tom 20 some years ago is the same message that is still doing it right now. Nothing changed. Nothing changed. People may have went one way and people may have went another way, but the message was ALWAYS ALWAYS OUR JOY. IT WAS ALWAYS, IT WAS ALWAYS WHAT KEPT US as believers. Hallelujah. There was a reason and you can ask any of us, anybody that was back there when we was back there when we was when we was the kids at the camps. There was two guys that I was that was our favorite preachers that we wanted to preach camp and it was brother Ron Spencer and brother Tom Ber. You can ask my wife right there cuz you know good and well you was going to hear the message and you was going to leave there bubbling full of joy. and I'd say a full gospel lighthouse. But this song kept resonating in my heart. This song, oh I lost some blessings. Let's go. Let's go to the very first verse. Oh, I've lost some good friends long away. Some loved ones departed in heaven this day. But thank God I didn't lose everything. Well, I've lost faith in people who said they care. In the time of my crisis, they were never there. But in my disappointment, in my season of pain, oh, one thing never wavered, one thing never changed. Well, I never lost my hope. Oh, and I never lost my joy. Oh, and I never lost my faith. Oh, one more so far. I never lost my praise. Well, I've let some blessings. I let them slip away. When I lost my focus and went a straight, but thank God I didn't lose everything. Well, I lost positions that were so dear and I lost some battles by walking in fear. But in the midst of my struggles, oh in the season of my pain, well, one thing never wavered, one thing never change. That I never lost my home. Oh, and I never lost my joy. Oh, I never lost my faith. Oh, God. Oh, somebody say, "Well, I never lost my hope." Oh, come on, somebody sing it. Oh, I never look that devil in your eyes and say, "I never lost it." And I never lost my I never lost it. I never lost it. I never lost it. I never lost my faith. But most of I never lost my praise. Oh, I never lost my I never lost. Come on, somebody. Oh, I never lost my joy. Lord, I never lost my faith. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I never lost it. It may have LOOKED LIKE IT. I may have looked down. I MAY HAVE LOOKED LIKE I WAS IN THE VALLEY, DOWN ON THE MOUNTAIN, UP ON HERE, BUT I NEVER LOST IT. Come on, SOMEBODY. I MAY HAVE BEEN IN SOME TRIALS. I MAY HAVE BEEN IN A BATTLE, BUT I NEVER LOST IT. I NEVER LOST my hope. I never lost my hope in this message. I never lost my joy. I STILL GOT MY JOY. I still got my joy. I still got it. That's why we ought to be the most happiest people on the earth. I got my joy and I got my joy shoes on. Anybody got their joy shoes on tonight? Well, go ahead and dance on them joy shoes just for a minute. Go ahead. Go ahead. The message gave you a right TO PUT YOUR JOY SHOES back home. MAYBE YOU STEPPED OUT OF THEM FOR A MINUTE, BUT JUST STEP RIGHT BACK IN. YOU'LL FIND OUT THE SHOE STILL FITS. Come on, somebody. You didn't CHANGE SIZES. YOU JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE SHOE. Let's step back in. I say put your joy shoes on. Well, if you got joy shoes on, then you better get ready to dance. You better be ready to run. You better ready to leap. If this message will put that kind of a joy inside of a 64 year old man, what ought it to do to you young boys? How many of you boys got your joy shoes on? Hey, we used to sing that song.
