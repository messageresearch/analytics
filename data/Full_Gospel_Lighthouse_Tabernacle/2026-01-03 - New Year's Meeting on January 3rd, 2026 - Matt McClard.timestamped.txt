[27:36] Lord, we look for great [music] and
[27:38] wonderful things to take place, Father.
[27:40] Lord, because we have you on our side,
[27:42] Lord Jesus. Lord, [music] we you're not
[27:44] a thousand miles away, a million miles
[27:46] away. You reign and you live in our very
[27:48] hearts, Lord Jesus. You're in our lives.

[27:52] day, Father. And Lord, we just love you
[27:54] and thank you, dear Lord Jesus. And

[28:13] you're [music] you're the way maker,
[28:14] Lord Jesus. You you you are always
[28:17] behind the scenes working. Even we don't
[28:19] see it. We don't feel it. As the song
[28:20] says, you're always working because you
[28:22] never stop working, Lord Jesus. [music]
[28:24] Lord, we've seen you do great and
[28:25] wonderful things. And if you've done it
[28:27] once, you can do it again, dear Father.
[28:29] [music] Lord, what is cancer? What is
[28:32] cancer to the almighty God, Lord Jesus?

[28:39] you, Lord. [music] So, we just thankful,
[28:41] Father. We just ask that you would

[28:49] is faced with these decisions, Lord, and
[28:51] cancers in his body, Lord. But you've

[28:55] him, Lord. [music] Lord, I am, Lord. And
[28:58] I know this congregation is so thankful
[29:00] for him, dear father. And Lord, we look
[29:02] for a great and a mighty miracle to take
[29:04] place in his life [music] this very
[29:07] year, Lord. I look for it tonight
[29:09] because that's the kind of believer I
[29:10] am, Lord Jesus. And I know that's the
[29:12] kind of believer that is standing here
[29:14] throughout this congregation tonight,
[29:15] Lord. So just touch him in a [music]
[29:16] mighty way. Touch each need, Father.

[29:21] each one of the ministers that they

[29:24] speak to me, Lord. and let him speak to
[29:25] the hearts, Lord Jesus, of each and
[29:27] every one of us, Father, that we can

[30:37] Jesus gave me a little [singing] light,
[30:41] told me, [music] "Let it shine. Let it
[30:44] shine. Let it shine all [music] the
[30:48] time.
[30:50] Well, I won't let Satan blow it out. I'm
[30:55] going to let it shine.

[32:00] Solomon [singing]

[35:22] [applause]
[36:11] like a viper strikes.
[36:17] I know that [singing] ain't [music] my

[36:23] liar [music and singing] in my ear tried
[36:27] to make me believe. [music]
[36:30] So I'm calling him out in the name of
[36:33] the Lord. Listen when I speak.

[39:12] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Boom.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Some of you need to tell him that
[39:26] tonight.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; He's already bothered you. Why don't you
[39:29] just tell him, "Get behind me.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; I come to church
[39:33] &gt;&gt; to have church.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; I come to get something. I come to leave
[39:37] victorious." Yes. Amen.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[39:41] the Lord. It's good to be home.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We love to go out and visit and
[39:46] share what God's doing and help
[39:48] somebody, but man, it's it's good to be
[39:50] home. It's good to be with you. So, how
[39:53] many's expecting?
[39:55] &gt;&gt; How many want to see God?
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads to him.
[39:59] You know, I don't know what your need
[40:00] is, but there's a God that knew your
[40:03] need before you walked through the
[40:04] building.
[40:05] There's a God that can speak personally.
[40:08] He's not a far off. He's here tonight.
[40:11] Not only that, he loves you.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; So, I don't know what the devil's told
[40:14] you about him not loving you. Just
[40:16] remember, the devil is a liar.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; He can't stop loving you. He won't stop
[40:24] loving you. That's by our hearts.
[40:27] Father,
[40:28] Lord, we come before you tonight, God,
[40:30] and we just ask you, Lord, to take this
[40:31] service, Father. Lord, you've ordained
[40:34] this, Father, the way it is, Father. And
[40:36] we know that you do all things well. So,
[40:38] Father, I pray that you just take each
[40:40] one of our thoughts, God. And may you
[40:42] just weave it together, Lord, as only
[40:43] you can, Father, that we'll just stand
[40:45] in awe, Lord God, of your presence, Lord
[40:47] God, and what you're doing in our midst,
[40:49] Father. God, I pray tonight, God. May
[40:51] you pour out your spirit, Father, and
[40:53] there may be healing, Lord. I cry out,
[40:55] Lord. I ask for fillings of the Holy
[40:56] Ghost, God. I ask for refillings of the
[40:58] Holy Ghost, Father. God, I ask that you
[41:00] would take this vessel of mine, God.
[41:02] Take this gift that you placed in my
[41:04] life, God, as I yield it to you, God.
[41:06] May you begin to work, Lord, from the
[41:07] front, to the back, to the right, to the
[41:09] left, God, and may you just minister to
[41:11] every need that's represented in the
[41:12] building, Father. And God, may we be
[41:14] like those on the way to Emmas, God. Did
[41:16] not our hearts burn with us as he talked
[41:18] to us along the way. God, we love you
[41:21] tonight, God. Take this service into thy
[41:23] hands. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:25] Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. If you
[41:28] have your Bibles, we'll turn to Luke
[41:29] chapter 7
[41:31] verse 36. I want to say thank you for
[41:33] all the gifts and merry Christmas and
[41:36] just feeling like we're one of you.
[41:38] Amen. We we truly love you. I want to
[41:41] take a take a moment to say thank you to
[41:43] Andrew and Ron.
[41:46] You guys are awesome.
[41:49] Matthew and William, man, it's great to
[41:52] be a part of this team. Amen.
[41:55] Amen.
[41:58] Luke 7:36. We'll take our text. You just
[42:02] pull. We'll preach as fast as we can and
[42:05] then we'll hand the baton. Amen.
[42:08] Amen. Verse 36. We'll read down through
[42:10] verse 50.
[42:12] And one of the Pharisees desired him
[42:14] that he would eat with him. And he went
[42:16] into the Pharisees house and sat down to
[42:18] meet. And behold, a woman in the city
[42:20] which is a sinner, and she knew not that
[42:22] Jesus sat at the meat, knew that Jesus
[42:25] sat at meat. in the Pharisees house,
[42:26] brought an alabaster box of ointment,
[42:29] and stood at his feet behind him
[42:30] weeping, began to wash his feet with
[42:32] tears, and he wiped them with her hairs
[42:34] of her head, and kissed his feet, and
[42:36] anointed them with the ointment. How
[42:38] many like to take that place tonight?
[42:42] And when the Pharisee which had bidden
[42:44] him saw it, he spake within himself,
[42:46] saying, "This man, if he were a prophet,
[42:48] would have known who and what manner of
[42:50] woman this was that touched him, for she
[42:52] is a sinner." And Jesus answered and
[42:55] said to him,"Simon, oh, could you
[42:58] imagine,
[43:00] I have somewhat to say unto thee." And
[43:03] he said, "Master, say on." Look at the
[43:05] arrogance.
[43:07] There was a certain creditor which had
[43:08] two debtors, and one owed 500 pence, the
[43:12] other 50. And when they had nothing to
[43:14] pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell
[43:17] me, therefore, which of them will have
[43:19] will will love him most? And Simon
[43:22] answered and said,"I suppose to him to
[43:25] him that forgave most." And he said unto
[43:28] him, "Thou has rightly judged." And he
[43:30] turned to the woman, and said unto her,
[43:32] said unto Simon, "Seeest thou this
[43:34] woman? I have entered into the house.
[43:37] Thou gavest me no water for my feet. She
[43:40] has washed my feet with her tears, and
[43:42] wiped them with the hairs of her head.
[43:44] Thou gavest me no kiss, but this woman
[43:46] since the time I came in, hath not
[43:48] ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil
[43:52] thou didest not anoint. But this woman
[43:54] had anointed my feet with th with
[43:56] ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, her
[43:58] sins which are many are forgiven, for
[44:00] she loved much. But to whom little is
[44:03] forgiven, the same loveth little. And he
[44:06] said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.
[44:10] And they that sat at me with him began
[44:11] to say within themselves, Who is this
[44:14] that forgiveth sins also? And he said
[44:16] unto woman, Thy faith hath saved thee.
[44:19] Go in peace. You may have your seats.
[44:29] I started it. Amen. Want to take a text
[44:31] if I might by the help of the Lord. Take
[44:33] advantage of your opportunity. Take
[44:36] advantage of your opportunity. Now the
[44:39] word opportunity is a set of
[44:41] circumstances that makes makes it
[44:43] possible to do something. Let me catch
[44:46] it. Now a circumstance is this is
[44:48] another definition. I'm teaching for two
[44:50] seconds. I'm no teacher. Circumstance
[44:53] fact or condition connected with the
[44:55] reent or relevant to an event or action.
[44:58] So an opportunity is circumstances. And
[45:01] then you've got the circumstances a fact
[45:03] or condition connected or relevant to an
[45:06] event or action. Let me give you some
[45:10] circumstances tonight. You ready?
[45:12] Hebrews 6:18.
[45:15] He says, "Is it impossible for God to
[45:18] lie?" You've come tonight, but won't you
[45:20] take advantage of your of your
[45:22] opportunity to recognize it's not just
[45:24] Brother Matt and Brother Ron and Brother
[45:26] Andrew and and your brother and sister
[45:29] sitting beside you, but there is a guest
[45:31] in the building tonight. Why don't you
[45:32] take advantage of your opportunity and
[45:34] begin to worship God? If he cannot lie
[45:37] and he said he'd be here, then I'm here
[45:39] to tell you he's here. Then what kind of
[45:41] opportunity do you have tonight? You can
[45:43] leave. Well, you can leave with
[45:45] [screaming] the Holy Ghost. You can
[45:46] leave victorious. You can leave on fire
[45:50] for God.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, I'm not going in
[45:52] this next year dwindling down. Maybe
[45:55] you're getting cold tonight. Well, this
[45:56] is your opportunity. Say, "Brother Matt,
[45:58] I need more of God." Listen, recognize
[46:01] when you're getting cold and don't stay
[46:03] in that condition. Why don't you say,
[46:05] "Father, I'm in need of some [screaming]
[46:07] fire on my bones." Come on. You can't
[46:10] stay there tonight. You're in the
[46:12] presence where all things change. Let me
[46:16] give you another circumstance. How many
[46:17] likes circumstances? Circumstances are
[46:20] facts. Oh, glory. Oh, we got some facts
[46:23] laying in this Bible, [screaming] saints
[46:24] of God. They're not to be, "Oh, that's
[46:26] no big deal." It's a big deal to say
[46:28] that God cannot lie.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not serving a [screaming] God that
[46:33] changes. The Bible said, "I am God and I
[46:37] change not."
[46:40] So if he healed back then, he'll heal
[46:42] today. If he saved back then, he'll save
[46:46] today.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; What do you have need [screaming] of
[46:49] tonight? This is your opportunity.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Why don't you take advantage of it?
[46:57] Oh, glory. Matthew 18:20, it says,
[47:00] "Where two or three are gathered
[47:02] together in my name, can I get a
[47:04] witness?
[47:09] How'd you gather tonight? Did you gather
[47:12] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[47:14] Well, the Bible says, "I cannot lie."
[47:16] But he also said, "Where two or three
[47:18] are gathered, I'll be in the midst."
[47:22] &gt;&gt; So, what kind of opportunity do you have
[47:24] tonight?
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Glory. Come on. This is a simple gospel,
[47:29] but when we come to church, what kind of
[47:31] opportunity do we have?
[47:34] Why don't you take advantage of it
[47:36] tonight? You've been along fighting your
[47:38] battles, fighting your battles. Feel
[47:39] like you got no victory. Well, why don't
[47:41] you just begin to praise God cuz the
[47:44] victory's in the building.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Let your tongue [screaming] go loose and
[47:52] take an opportunity when you don't feel
[47:54] like it. Give him praise anyway.
[48:02] Where the spirit of the Lord is.
[48:06] Where the spirit of Lord is.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. Where the spirit of the Lord
[48:10] is,
[48:11] &gt;&gt; I am God. And I changed out. And that
[48:14] same spirit that fell on the day of
[48:15] Pentecost. It's the same spirit here
[48:18] tonight. And he's here to give you
[48:19] liberty.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Listen, we're not sitting in a jail
[48:23] cell, but a lot of you, some of you are
[48:25] sitting in a jail cell right here.
[48:28] Oh, glory.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm coming right down your
[48:31] alley. The devil's the one telling you
[48:33] that. The devil's the one trying to hold
[48:36] you back. But the spirit of the Lord
[48:37] here is to give liberty to the thoughts
[48:40] that are [screaming] trying to hold you
[48:41] back.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; That's not God's word. It's a lie
[48:45] straight from the pits of hell.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Well, glory. Where the spirit of the
[48:51] Lord is, there's healing.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. They would bring them
[48:54] in there one way and they'd leave out
[48:56] another.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; How many's went to church one way and
[49:01] left out another?
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz I took advantage of my
[49:05] opportunity. [screaming] How do I do it,
[49:07] brother Matt? Do I sing? Do I dance?
[49:09] What do I do? Let your faith go.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Let your faith go.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; You're not getting it. Let it go
[49:17] [screaming] tonight. Say, "Lord, it's
[49:19] already mine.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; You paid for it.
[49:25] Glory.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; I love church.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Let me give you another one. I'll never
[49:34] leave you nor forsake you. How many's
[49:37] felt forsaken when you walked through
[49:39] the building? Well, I'm here to tell you
[49:40] that was just a feeling that was
[49:42] straight from the pits of hell. That was
[49:43] a thought that the devil's trying to
[49:44] bring your past up. He's trying to bring
[49:46] your sins up. He's trying to bring your
[49:48] iniquities up. But let me tell you, when
[49:50] you go to God's book, there's no record
[49:52] [screaming] of it. Why are you stopping,
[49:55] brother Matt? There's devil's hands I'm
[49:57] crushing right now.
[50:02] [applause]
[50:04] &gt;&gt; You crush his head, he has a hard time
[50:06] talking.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; There'd be somebody [screaming] that
[50:11] would bruise his head.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. This isn't time to
[50:19] lay down. This is an opportunity to show
[50:23] what God has done in this age.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; He's not got a people going down. He's
[50:28] got a people going up.
[50:33] Man, it's good to be home.
[50:37] Why don't you go ahead and start
[50:37] believing for the impossible?
[50:39] &gt;&gt; It's your opportunity tonight. But the
[50:41] matter, I've never had that kind of
[50:42] victory. I can't have that's just what
[50:43] they talk about. No, that victory is for
[50:46] you. I'm not backing down from it. This
[50:50] [screaming] is your opportunity.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; I got to go. Here we go. Think about
[50:57] this Pharisee. I'm going quick now. This
[50:59] Pharisee, brother, picks this up and he
[51:01] talks about the courier coming to get
[51:02] him.
[51:04] He got so busy. The courier. I got to
[51:06] get there. I gota do this. Hey, hey,
[51:08] hey. Will you come to my party? Will you
[51:11] come? No, don't go with me. Stay right
[51:12] there. There's an example, man. It's
[51:13] good. Hey, look. That's a good boy right
[51:15] there. He been tall. Well,
[51:18] but the courier, he was respectful, but
[51:21] he didn't recognize what type of
[51:24] opportunity
[51:25] &gt;&gt; he had.
[51:28] He had an opportunity to speak to the
[51:30] King of Kings. He had an opportunity.
[51:32] Oh, glory. Listen, somebody. You may not
[51:35] recognize your opportunity, but let me
[51:38] tell you, the Lord Jesus is in the
[51:39] building and he's longing for
[51:41] [screaming] an opportunity to talk to
[51:43] you.
[51:46] Brother Matt, you've hit me on every
[51:47] point. Then recognize it's not me
[51:49] hitting you.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. It's not me hitting
[51:55] you. It's God [screaming] letting you
[51:57] know I'm in the building. I am
[52:00] discerning your thoughts and intents,
[52:02] [screaming]
[52:02] &gt;&gt; and I am speaking
[52:04] &gt;&gt; to your need.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Don't miss your opportunity.
[52:11] Listen, I'm going to read these quotes
[52:13] real quick. And the courier bowed his
[52:15] head and started away. This is a sprint.
[52:18] His courier bowed his head and started
[52:20] to run away. Run away back to his
[52:22] master. How could he do it? What caused
[52:24] him to do that? Just bring the message,
[52:26] stand before the prince of all preaches,
[52:29] have an audition with him, had an
[52:31] interview with the king of glory, and
[52:33] fails to see his opportunity.
[52:40] You may not be the preacher, but you're
[52:42] sitting in a pew tonight and the King of
[52:44] Kings comes personal to you and he
[52:46] begins to say to you, "This is your
[52:48] opportunity." You've doubted whether you
[52:50] got the Holy Ghost. You've doubted
[52:51] whether God could heal you. You've
[52:53] doubted whether you could have that kind
[52:54] of victory. You doubted whether you
[52:55] could put cigarettes down. You've
[52:56] doubted whether alcohol could go away.
[52:58] But I'm here to tell you, there's a man
[53:00] in the building. Don't miss this
[53:02] opportunity. The man is [screaming]
[53:04] here, King Jesus. Why? Not only because
[53:07] he said he would, but he's here tonight
[53:10] because your [screaming] praise brought
[53:11] him down.
[53:18] Brother said, "Don't miss your
[53:19] opportunity. It's presented to every man
[53:21] and woman in the world daily."
[53:25] Catch that now. Daily. Daily. You got to
[53:28] take advantage of every opportunity.
[53:31] Listen, the devil don't want you to pick
[53:33] up the good old book, but take an
[53:35] advantage to talk to your king once
[53:37] again.
[53:38] But man, I've read it for five days
[53:40] straight, and I feel like I ain't got
[53:41] anything.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; He's just setting you up for day six.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Woo, [screaming] that's good right
[53:49] there.
[53:51] You know what? I think the best is yet
[53:53] [screaming] to come.
[53:56] But man, I've listened to that message.
[53:57] It's been on my heart and on my heart.
[53:59] And I've listened, listen, listen. and I
[54:01] feel like I can't get anything from it.
[54:03] Listen again. [screaming]
[54:05] God wants to know. Will you be
[54:07] persevering? Take the opportunity to
[54:09] say, "Lord, that's your voice. I believe
[54:12] it."
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Somebody better have a Jubilee on
[54:17] Thursday.
[54:19] Somebody have a good old time in the
[54:20] car. Come on, somebody.
[54:23] Brother says, "Use every opportunity to
[54:26] get to Jesus."
[54:29] Listen to me. So many times we come in
[54:31] here with a need and you know you got a
[54:33] need. I don't know you got a need, but
[54:34] you know you got a need. Some of you
[54:36] don't realize you got a need until the
[54:37] guy gets preaching. Then you realize, oh
[54:39] goodness, that's me. That was David one
[54:42] time.
[54:44] Who are you talking about? That's you,
[54:45] David. Sometimes revelation comes like
[54:48] that and we don't like it. But what will
[54:50] you do with it? Will you take the
[54:51] opportunity to be like Saul or will you
[54:53] take the opportunity to humble yourself
[54:54] like David and say, "Father, forgive me.
[54:57] Have mercy." Why don't you take this
[54:59] opportunity to enter the new year? Get
[55:00] your slate clean. Ask God for
[55:03] forgiveness. Come on, somebody.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; If God's been convicting you,
[55:12] why you sitting on it?
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Take the opportunity to say, "Father,
[55:17] forgive me,
[55:19] &gt;&gt; brother Matt. It's been 20 years since
[55:21] I've struggled with that thing." Well,
[55:23] tonight is different.
[55:26] Your faith is beginning to grow.
[55:32] [laughter]
[55:34] Think about Peter and his disciples.
[55:35] Don't go. You know that that guy's a
[55:37] Pharisee.
[55:39] In fact, I think he was at the last
[55:41] meeting. Brother Brandham called him a
[55:42] chubby fell.
[55:46] He called him a fat little guy. That's
[55:47] what he did. [sighs]
[55:50] Nothing against that. No. Take an
[55:52] opportunity. Look in the mirror. Well,
[55:56] praise the Lord. That's good for you,
[55:58] too.
[56:01] You breathe like this. There's something
[56:02] needs to happen.
[56:05] Preach, buddy.
[56:10] Nobody else's fault but mine. All right,
[56:11] hurry.
[56:13] Listen.
[56:15] Here's the thing.
[56:19] Peter, don't go. He don't want to hear
[56:21] what you got to say. He doesn't want you
[56:23] there.
[56:24] He doesn't want you there. He doesn't
[56:26] want you there. But here's the thing.
[56:28] Jesus goes where he's invited.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. He goes where he's
[56:34] invited.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm not
[56:36] making him the first, second, third. I'm
[56:38] not making him any other place but the
[56:39] first place in my life. Make him the
[56:41] first place in your marriage. Make him
[56:42] the first place in your job. Make
[56:44] [screaming] him the first place as a
[56:45] husband. Make him the first place as a
[56:47] daddy, as a mama. Make him first place.
[56:50] And you watched the [screaming]
[56:51] blessing. You took an opportunity. Say,
[56:54] "Father, lead me. Guide me." There's
[56:57] sometimes I'm an idiot, but God, you do
[57:00] all things. Well,
[57:03] &gt;&gt; let me catch this. You never speak to
[57:05] Jesus unless he always gives you the
[57:07] opportunity.
[57:08] [snorts] He was He was then and is he is
[57:12] now. For he's longing and waiting for an
[57:14] interview with every person.
[57:21] I know about half you go, "I'm not
[57:24] worthy." You ain't going to get worthy,
[57:26] so quit worrying about it. He still
[57:29] wants to talk to you.
[57:31] After Peter made all his mistakes, he
[57:33] said, "Get Peter, too."
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. You'll get that
[57:39] in a couple days.
[57:41] [sighs and gasps]
[57:44] But catch this. No matter how faint it
[57:45] is, he knows every need that you have
[57:48] need of. Not one little prayer can be
[57:51] said without him knowing it.
[57:56] How many say, "Thank the Lord." When you
[57:58] didn't feel like you could really give a
[58:00] prayer, get down and put Lord, you're
[58:02] just going to have to help me. He heard
[58:04] that, too. And let me ask you, did he
[58:06] fail you? He was right there. You say,
[58:09] "Brother Matt, but I was expecting a
[58:10] light to open from heaven and
[58:13] [screaming] this happens." No, he
[58:15] doesn't in the stillness. He'll move
[58:18] right into your situation. Well, why
[58:20] don't you take this opportunity right
[58:21] now? Say, "Father, thank you for all my
[58:23] misrecks. Thank you, Lord, for my
[58:24] wealth. Thank you, Lord, for my health.
[58:26] Thank you, Lord, for where you've been."
[58:27] Take an opportunity right now. There was
[58:29] 10 lepers one time, and one of them went
[58:32] back and said, "Lord, [screaming] I want
[58:33] to cry out and say, "Thank you." Listen,
[58:36] what did they do? They took God at his
[58:38] word. Let me catch this real quick. The
[58:40] lepers every week they were going to the
[58:43] priest, going to the priest, going to
[58:45] the priest. Had to go get checked. And
[58:46] what did Jesus tell them?
[58:49] Go to the priest.
[58:52] Do you think in their mind they were
[58:54] like, "Are you serious? We do this all
[58:57] the time." But you know what? They just
[59:00] took him at his word and started
[59:02] walking. And as they were walking, the
[59:04] Bible says
[59:06] as they were walking,
[59:10] I know I'm preaching right now. How
[59:12] many's been while you're walking saw
[59:13] some leprosy
[59:15] and he just said, "Keep going to church.
[59:17] Keep on walking." And you look down on a
[59:20] Oh, glory. You look down two months
[59:22] later and that desire has been
[59:25] completely gone for your body. Well, I'm
[59:27] [screaming] giving you the opportunity.
[59:29] Why don't you return around and go thank
[59:31] Jesus for what he did in the quiet
[59:33] [screaming] walk.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[59:49] Think about this woman.
[59:51] She took full advantage of her
[59:52] opportunity.
[59:56] She heard Jesus was there.
[1:00:00] Listen, I'm going I want to hit this
[1:00:01] real quick. Don't grow complacency in
[1:00:03] this church.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Spirit of the Lord moves. Praise the
[1:00:08] Lord. Yep. He's going to move. Yes, we
[1:00:11] expect God to move. But when God moves,
[1:00:14] you make sure your voice is heard. You
[1:00:16] say, "Brother man, I'm not a screamer. I
[1:00:18] ain't saying you got to scream. Make
[1:00:19] sure God [screaming] hears your voice.
[1:00:21] Thank you, Father. When I can't say the
[1:00:23] words, listen to my heart, God. I thank
[1:00:26] you for dropping the service. That
[1:00:27] sister had been struggling [screaming]
[1:00:28] forever. Lord, I'd sit on her for three
[1:00:30] weeks. I've been praying for her. And
[1:00:32] you know what God says? You [screaming]
[1:00:34] prayed and there's your answer.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; This woman, she had a reputation. She
[1:00:45] had problems.
[1:00:49] But she found out Jesus was going to be
[1:00:50] there. [sighs]
[1:00:52] She wasn't invited,
[1:00:56] but she wanted to get into his presence.
[1:01:02] She sold, went and got her money bag.
[1:01:04] Brother talks about it. She went and got
[1:01:06] her money bag. Let me tell you how much
[1:01:07] money that was, by the way. Between 30
[1:01:10] Wait, hold on. I'll mess it up.
[1:01:13] Between 30 and $50,000 worth
[1:01:19] the Bible said, begin to look at this.
[1:01:22] 300 days work.
[1:01:25] She wanted to make sure he knew how
[1:01:27] important it was that I get the
[1:01:29] opportunity to get into your presence.
[1:01:31] I'm willing to give my all. Come on,
[1:01:34] somebody. When's the last time you gave
[1:01:35] a $30,000 offering?
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Well, preacher, brother, man, I believe
[1:01:38] I am. Amen. But when's the last time you
[1:01:40] begin to pour out your whole heart?
[1:01:42] Listen, she didn't just pour out her
[1:01:43] money bag. I'm not looking for an
[1:01:45] offering. I'm not [screaming] looking
[1:01:46] for a money. But I'm here to paint you
[1:01:47] an example. When you get in the presence
[1:01:50] of God, take advantage of it no matter
[1:01:53] what the cost.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; This is your opportunity. Listen, you
[1:02:01] ain't got to wait for a prayer line. You
[1:02:03] ain't got to wait on somebody to lay
[1:02:05] hands on you. You're a gentile and
[1:02:07] [screaming] you can believe as the word
[1:02:09] is going forth. This is my opportunity.
[1:02:12] I'm not waiting for somebody to touch
[1:02:14] me. I'm not waiting for somebody to pray
[1:02:15] for me. I [screaming] believe the word
[1:02:18] and it's mine.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; I got seven minutes.
[1:02:26] She took all she had. [laughter]
[1:02:32] I want to go to somebody else real
[1:02:33] quick. Blind Barameus. [panting]
[1:02:37] There he was. Brother Bam said he didn't
[1:02:39] have but one opportunity.
[1:02:44] Listen, young person.
[1:02:46] You know who's talking to you.
[1:02:51] Listen, old person. You know who's
[1:02:53] talking to you.
[1:02:55] Everybody in between, I catch you, too.
[1:03:02] Blind Barnameus couldn't see him. Maybe
[1:03:05] your vision is a little dim tonight. You
[1:03:07] can't see a far off.
[1:03:10] But blind Barnameus begin to hear
[1:03:11] commotion. You know where Jesus is? He's
[1:03:14] loud. I don't know about you, I like a
[1:03:16] church that enters in. Come on. I'm
[1:03:18] right at home right here. I like a
[1:03:19] church that enters in. When the word of
[1:03:21] God hits you, you say amen to it. Come
[1:03:23] on, somebody. When the word of God hits
[1:03:24] you, you say hallelujah. When the word
[1:03:26] of God hit you, say, "Glory, brother
[1:03:27] Matt." That's the truth, brother Matt.
[1:03:29] It hurt me, but that's the truth anyway.
[1:03:31] You begin to say that and you watch it.
[1:03:34] It may have hurt you then. But the next
[1:03:36] time you can shout, [screaming] "Glory."
[1:03:37] Because the same God that heard you,
[1:03:39] amen, in the word, is the same God
[1:03:41] that'll bring it to pass in your life.
[1:03:47] Blind Barnameus. There he was. They
[1:03:50] begin to pass by. I'm sure. Blind.
[1:03:52] What's going on? What? What's going on?
[1:03:54] I heard Jason. Is he here? Is he here? I
[1:03:57] can't see. Come on, somebody [screaming]
[1:03:59] help me out.
[1:04:02] Shh. He's right over there. [sighs]
[1:04:06] Blind Barnameus took advantage of his
[1:04:07] opportunity. He said, "I might be I'll
[1:04:09] be able to find him. I might stand and
[1:04:11] walk and find my way, but I'm going to
[1:04:13] begin to cry out. I'm going to begin to
[1:04:15] cry out. Brother Brandham said he was
[1:04:16] 200 yards away.
[1:04:19] So, let me paint the picture for you.
[1:04:21] Two football fields and it's loud. How
[1:04:24] many's ever been in a football field and
[1:04:25] the crowd's cheering? Some of those
[1:04:28] people that came took an opportunity to
[1:04:29] make fun of him. They took an
[1:04:30] opportunity to throw throw eggs at him.
[1:04:32] They took an opportunity to do that. But
[1:04:33] I'm not here to do any of that. I come
[1:04:36] for an opportunity to cry out to my
[1:04:37] maker and say, "Father, in 2026, it's
[1:04:40] going to get darker, but Lord, you said
[1:04:42] there'd be light in the evening time.
[1:04:44] And Father, will you shine that light
[1:04:45] through me? This is my opportunity not
[1:04:47] to go down, but to go up in Jesus
[1:04:50] Christ."
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Blind Barnameus,
[1:04:57] he began to cry out,
[1:04:59] "Jesus, have mercy on me."
[1:05:04] Listen, it isn't how loud your voice is.
[1:05:06] I talked about your let your face loose.
[1:05:08] Let your faith loose. You might be the
[1:05:10] one that's blind tonight. You can't see
[1:05:12] yourself walking in.
[1:05:14] You can't see your walking as a sinless,
[1:05:16] spotless bride. But let me ask you, if
[1:05:18] Jesus would give you a vision to that,
[1:05:20] he's given you [screaming] a vision of
[1:05:21] that. He's here today to let you know
[1:05:23] you are my bride.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Most of us don't feel like it.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Come on, go ahead and raise your hands.
[1:05:32] You're not. It means you have the You
[1:05:34] know what that is? That's nothing but
[1:05:35] the devil trying to beat you down. But
[1:05:36] he he didn't say, "Did you feel it?" He
[1:05:39] said, "If thou can't believe, all things
[1:05:43] are possible." Then why don't you start
[1:05:44] saying, "Lord, it's me. It's me in the
[1:05:46] mirror of God's word." That's the reason
[1:05:48] I can't get away from it. And father, I
[1:05:50] come tonight to get an opportunity to
[1:05:52] draw close to you.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "Now faith cometh by
[1:05:57] hearing and hear the word." He knew that
[1:05:59] Jesus was come by. He would he couldn't
[1:06:00] say, "No, wait. I might see him another
[1:06:02] day. Quit putting it off. What are you
[1:06:07] waiting for? [screaming]
[1:06:08] This is your opportunity."
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Listen, this woman didn't care what
[1:06:13] everybody else thought about her. It's
[1:06:15] about time you stop caring what your
[1:06:17] brother thinks about you, what your
[1:06:19] sister thinks about you. There's one man
[1:06:21] in the room. [screaming] I care what he
[1:06:23] thinks.
[1:06:25] [applause]
[1:06:30] Now, if you have faith, come by hearing,
[1:06:31] hear the word. He knew Jesus come by.
[1:06:33] Now, wait, I might see him another day.
[1:06:35] I'll try tomorrow night in the next
[1:06:36] meeting. He didn't have that
[1:06:37] opportunity. That was his first and last
[1:06:40] opportunity. The only opportunity he
[1:06:42] ever had, ever would have to receive his
[1:06:44] sight. So, he had to do something. He
[1:06:46] raised and screamed at the top of the
[1:06:48] voice, "Jesus, thou son of David, have
[1:06:51] mercy on me. Have mercy on me." Brother
[1:06:54] Ram said there was no way he could hear
[1:06:57] his voice, but he said he felt the
[1:06:59] pressure of blind Barnameus's faith
[1:07:02] calling him.
[1:07:05] I don't know about you, but why don't
[1:07:07] you begin to press on him? Why don't you
[1:07:08] let your face say, "Father, I need a
[1:07:10] refilling."
[1:07:12] Listen, I didn't come to this weekend
[1:07:14] not to leave with something. I want a
[1:07:15] refilling of the Holy Ghost. I don't
[1:07:17] care if it happens while I'm preaching.
[1:07:18] I don't care when it happens. I want a
[1:07:20] more of God in my life. I want more of
[1:07:23] God. This is your opportunity then. What
[1:07:25] are you waiting on? A special service?
[1:07:27] This is special. [screaming] He's here.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Almost done. There was a woman with an
[1:07:38] issue of blood.
[1:07:40] She had tried every opportunity to get
[1:07:42] well.
[1:07:46] She tried every opportunity. Went to
[1:07:48] every doctor, done everything they told
[1:07:50] her.
[1:07:52] But she heard he was passing by. Let me
[1:07:55] ask you, let me tell you. He's not
[1:07:56] passing by. He's here.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Won't you say a little bit, Jesus?
[1:08:04] Simon may not Simon and the Pharisee
[1:08:06] didn't wake you. Welcome, but I want to.
[1:08:09] I'm crying out to you tonight, Lord.
[1:08:12] Listen. Brother Bam said this. She be to
[1:08:14] cry.
[1:08:16] Back to the woman, different woman.
[1:08:18] Stick with me.
[1:08:21] She began to cry and wash his feet.
[1:08:23] And she took her glory,
[1:08:27] all of her glory,
[1:08:29] and begin to wipe the dirt,
[1:08:34] the gunk,
[1:08:36] the manure. Come on, somebody.
[1:08:39] She wanted to make him welcome.
[1:08:42] What about tonight? This is your
[1:08:45] opportunity.
[1:08:50] Won't you press through your idea?
[1:08:54] Won't you press through your past? Come
[1:08:56] on, somebody. Won't you press through
[1:08:58] every thought that says you can't have
[1:08:59] what you want? Won't you press through
[1:09:01] it to say, "Lord, I'm coming anyway.
[1:09:03] Lord, if I can just touch, if I can feel
[1:09:06] your presence, Father, if I can get
[1:09:08] there, Lord, I know [screaming]
[1:09:09] something will happen."
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; All right. I don't count down.
[1:09:17] Brother Matt, I have so many battles.
[1:09:19] Brother Brand would tell you, it's God
[1:09:20] giving you opportunity to have
[1:09:21] victories.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; So quit looking at him as you did
[1:09:24] something wrong. It's God showing, hey,
[1:09:26] you got a sword, you got a shield, you
[1:09:28] got armor. Why don't you go take that
[1:09:30] demon's head off?
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Listen, we may never kill 600
[1:09:34] Philistines like Shamgar, but you have
[1:09:37] 600 thoughts that come to your mind on a
[1:09:40] daily basis. Why don't you take that
[1:09:42] [screaming] thought and cut its head
[1:09:43] off? How do I do that, brother man? I
[1:09:45] take the word and it says it doesn't
[1:09:47] line up with it. That's not what he
[1:09:49] called me to.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Let me finish with this quote.
[1:09:57] Two quotes. He said she stopped. She
[1:09:59] said, "Oh, I just can't do it." This is
[1:10:02] the woman with the alabaster box. She
[1:10:05] said, "I just can't get. What would he
[1:10:07] say about a woman like me? What would he
[1:10:09] say? But here they invited him and it's
[1:10:13] my opportunity." Oh, you don't realize
[1:10:15] what an opportunity you got. You got an
[1:10:17] opportunity today, friends, to be filled
[1:10:18] with the Holy Ghost. You got an
[1:10:20] opportunity today to to be a saint of
[1:10:22] God.
[1:10:24] You don't have to be a stinker stinking
[1:10:26] sinner. You can be a saint. You don't
[1:10:28] have to be a hypocrite.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; He don't want no Pharisees.
[1:10:38] There's a real deal. And I know I'm
[1:10:40] looking at her.
[1:10:44] You don't have to be a church attender
[1:10:46] and not a Christian. You don't have to
[1:10:48] go along with her act and you're a
[1:10:49] Christian. You go to church, hide your
[1:10:50] meanness. You can really be a Christian.
[1:10:52] You got an opportunity. Let me face with
[1:10:56] this closing quote right here. How many
[1:10:59] loves him?
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; But to think that it's true. One time
[1:11:04] those men were as we are here this
[1:11:06] morning. They had their opportunity and
[1:11:08] we've got ours. What are you going to do
[1:11:12] with it?
[1:11:14] You've got an opportunity to win souls.
[1:11:19] All right, everybody say amen. Ready?
[1:11:21] One, two, three. Amen.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; So, you got a voice.
[1:11:26] It's your opportunity to start spreading
[1:11:28] the good news. If he could save me,
[1:11:32] brother David, if he could change my
[1:11:34] life, Brother Andy, if he could change
[1:11:37] me, he can change you. Brother Matt,
[1:11:40] they don't want to hear it. I don't care
[1:11:42] if they want to hear it or not. One of
[1:11:43] these days, they'll come looking for you
[1:11:45] and say, "What were you talking about?"
[1:11:46] Brother Ron has a testimony. He was with
[1:11:48] a guy in a nitrogly factor every day. He
[1:11:51] began to witness to him every day. Every
[1:11:53] day. Every day. Five years after he
[1:11:55] left, he went back there and preached
[1:11:56] there. That guy walked from the back of
[1:11:58] the church, walked up there before the
[1:11:59] preaching. I don't need to hear any
[1:12:01] doctrine. I need Jesus. What was it? He
[1:12:04] took the opportunity to share what God
[1:12:06] has given me. Brother M. God [screaming]
[1:12:08] had given very much. He wants you to
[1:12:10] give what he gave you and he'll give you
[1:12:12] more.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; All right, let me stop.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Let me finish right here. Oh, make every
[1:12:19] ounce of it count for the Lord Jesus.
[1:12:21] Have no times for things of the world.
[1:12:23] Lay aside every weight that does so
[1:12:25] easily beset you. And the bride says,
[1:12:28] "Let us run this race with patience. Let
[1:12:30] us set before us. Let the love of the
[1:12:32] Lord Jesus be kind to one another. Be
[1:12:34] kind to your enemies." The bride says,
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; "They won't be your enemies. You start
[1:12:42] being kind.
[1:12:46] Don't make them your enemy. Don't give
[1:12:48] them the opportunity to be your enemy."
[1:12:51] Brother Matt, but they constantly Uhhuh.
[1:12:53] Take that circle.
[1:12:56] Love of Jesus is so wonderful. Love I
[1:13:01] got to move. It's bigger. Love of Jesus.
[1:13:04] But brother M. I got to go way out here
[1:13:06] and get him. Listen, if you got to go to
[1:13:08] the back of the church, if you got to
[1:13:10] walk to the ends of the earth to make
[1:13:12] the love of Jesus be real to somebody,
[1:13:14] then this is your opportunity. Listen.
[1:13:17] Don't wait on [screaming] somebody else
[1:13:19] to take to do what you've got to do.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; I'm done.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; I'm done. Let's stand.
[1:13:26] Are we standing? Are we sitting? What we
[1:13:27] doing?
[1:13:30] I love you, Lord.
[1:13:32] Can you see? I wait on Sister Cassie. I
[1:13:34] mean appreciates our musicians.
[1:13:41] I love you, Lord,
[1:13:46] for your mercy.
[1:13:52] Oh, [music] all my days
[1:13:55] I've been held in your hand.
[1:14:01] From the moment that I wake
[1:14:04] [music and singing] up
[1:14:06] until I lay my head,
[1:14:11] I [music and singing]
[1:14:12] will sing
[1:14:14] of the goodness [music]
[1:14:17] of God. All my life.
[1:14:23] Oh, [music] and all my life [singing]
[1:14:26] you have been faithful.
[1:14:29] [music]
[1:14:33] Oh, and all my life you have been
[1:14:36] [music and singing] so so good.
[1:14:43] With every breath that I [music]
[1:14:47] I'm able,
[1:14:49] [singing]
[1:14:50] I will sing [music]
[1:14:53] of the goodness [singing]
[1:14:56] of God. [music] I love your voice as
[1:14:59] brother Titus, Sister Reagan, Sister
[1:15:01] India as you come. [music] I love your
[1:15:03] voice.
[1:15:05] Well, [singing] you have led me through
[1:15:08] [music] the fire
[1:15:12] in the darkest night.
[1:15:15] When you [music] are close like no
[1:15:19] other.
[1:15:22] I've known you as a father.
[1:15:27] I've known you as [singing and music] my
[1:15:29] friend.
[1:15:32] I have
[1:15:35] in the goodness [singing]
[1:15:38] of God.
[1:15:40] All my life.
[1:15:42] Hallelujah.
[1:15:44] Oh, and all my [singing] life you have
[1:15:47] been faithful. [music]
[1:15:50] All my life you have been
[1:15:58] so [music]
[1:15:59] so good.
[1:16:03] With every breath that I I make,
[1:16:10] oh, I'm going to sing
[1:16:15] of the goodness [music]
[1:16:17] of God.
[1:16:19] You can be seated.
[1:16:51] The sun was darkened [music] and the
[1:16:54] heavens
[1:16:56] thundered.
[1:16:58] And [music] for a moment death had
[1:17:00] thought [singing] it conered.
[1:17:04] But it wasn't [music] over till you said
[1:17:08] it's over.
[1:17:11] Your word is greater still.
[1:17:17] The [music and singing] perfect
[1:17:18] sacrifice your body
[1:17:21] broken.
[1:17:23] As [music and singing] you restored to
[1:17:25] us what sin had stolen,
[1:17:30] haunting for [music] all you tore the
[1:17:32] [singing] veil wide open.
[1:17:36] Your power is stronger
[1:17:38] [music and singing] still.
[1:17:41] All praise,
[1:17:45] all praise [music]
[1:17:48] to the name [singing]
[1:17:49] above all names.
[1:17:54] Jesus, [music and singing]
[1:17:57] you reign
[1:18:00] cuz you're the [singing and music] name
[1:18:02] above all names.
[1:18:06] [music]
[1:18:08] You turned the grave into [singing]
[1:18:10] a new beginning. [music]
[1:18:14] Our God is risen. You're alive [singing]
[1:18:18] and breathing. [music]
[1:18:20] There's nothing that can rise against
[1:18:24] your victory. [music and singing]
[1:18:27] Your name is higher still.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Your name [singing] is higher still.
[1:18:38] And all praise, [singing]

[1:18:58] above all names.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, [music and singing] you are. Yes,
[1:19:05] you are.
[1:19:07] There is no name higher. [music]
[1:19:10] There is no name greater.
[1:19:14] And the cross still [music] stands.
[1:19:18] The blood still flows. [singing]
[1:19:21] The work [music] is finished. And hell
[1:19:24] still knows that the grave is still
[1:19:28] [singing] empty. The stone is still
[1:19:31] [music] rolled.
[1:19:33] And you're still high and [singing]
[1:19:35] lifted [music] up. You're still seated
[1:19:38] on the throne. The cross still [singing]
[1:19:41] stands
[1:19:42] [music] and the blood still flows.
[1:19:46] The work is finished [music and singing]
[1:19:48] and hell still knows
[1:19:51] that the grave is still empty.
[1:19:55] The stone is still rolled
[1:19:56] [music and singing]
[1:19:58] and you're still high and lifted up.
[1:20:02] You're still seated on [music] the
[1:20:04] throne. [singing] And all praise,

[1:20:26] all names.
[1:20:37] Hallelujah.

[1:20:53] [music]
[1:20:57] H [singing] to H we will sing. There is
[1:21:00] no higher name. [music] Hallelujah.
[1:21:09] Every [music and singing] voice will
[1:21:11] proclaim there is no higher name.
[1:21:15] [singing and music] Hallelujah.
[1:21:22] Hands to [music and singing] waves we
[1:21:23] will sing.
[1:21:27] All [music] praise.
[1:21:30] All [singing] praise
[1:21:33] to the [music] name above all names.

[1:21:42] you reign.
[1:21:45] Cuz you're the [music and singing] name
[1:21:47] above all names.
[1:21:52] You're [singing and music] the name
[1:21:54] above all names.
[1:21:58] You're the [singing and music] name
[1:22:00] above all names.
[1:22:08] [applause]
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He's the name above all
[1:22:17] names and worthy of all praise, honor,
[1:22:20] and glory. Amen. Let's stand if you
[1:22:22] will.
[1:22:23] How many happy to be in the house of the
[1:22:25] Lord?
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Man, I tell you what, if you can't
[1:22:27] be happy after that sermon, Brother
[1:22:29] Matt,
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; got to take your opportunity. How many
[1:22:32] appreciated that?
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless each and every one of
[1:22:36] you. Certainly wish you a happy new
[1:22:38] year.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Certainly looking forward to everything
[1:22:41] the Lord has in store. Because
[1:22:42] regardless of what happens and comes
[1:22:44] this year, serving the Lord can only be
[1:22:46] good.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you'll turn with me,
[1:22:49] we'll just get right in the word here.
[1:22:50] If you'll turn with me in two places,
[1:22:52] Mark chapter 11
[1:22:54] and then in Hebrews chap 11 also we'll
[1:22:57] read Mark 11. Very familiar text here,
[1:22:59] 11:22.
[1:23:01] As you're flipping here, you know this,
[1:23:04] all the word of God is powerful.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; But this particular text, this
[1:23:09] particular scripture here was so deep
[1:23:11] and so powerful, the prophet wouldn't
[1:23:14] preach it for years. He couldn't
[1:23:15] understand it until God showed it to
[1:23:18] him. And then he preached it to us as
[1:23:21] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; And we can now take this scripture and
[1:23:25] make it live. Amen. 11 Mark 11:22. And
[1:23:29] Jesus answering saith unto them, have
[1:23:33] faith in God.
[1:23:36] For verily I say unto you, that
[1:23:39] whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
[1:23:42] Be thou removed, and be thou cast into
[1:23:45] the sea, and shall not doubt in his
[1:23:49] heart,
[1:23:51] but shall believe that those things
[1:23:54] which he
[1:23:56] with which he saith shall come to pass.
[1:24:00] Not what brother Brandham said, not just
[1:24:02] what Jesus said, but what you say
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; shall come to pass. He shall have
[1:24:09] whatsoever he saith.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Therefore, I say unto you, whatsoever
[1:24:14] things ye desire when you pray, believe
[1:24:18] that you receive them, and ye shall have
[1:24:21] them.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; See, that's the the condition. That is
[1:24:24] the caveat is that you can have anything
[1:24:27] you ask for
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; but you got to believe.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews 11:1,
[1:24:34] now faith
[1:24:36] is the substance
[1:24:40] of things hoped for,
[1:24:44] the evidence of things not seen.
[1:24:49] There is a volume of things that were
[1:24:52] just said right there. Let's read it
[1:24:54] again. Now faith
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; is the substance
[1:24:59] of things hoped for. It is the evidence
[1:25:03] of things that you don't see. Amen.
[1:25:06] Let's bow bow our heads and our hearts.
[1:25:08] Gracious heavenly father, we thank you,
[1:25:09] Lord Jesus, for the wonderful time we've
[1:25:12] already had in your presence. We thank
[1:25:13] you for the word that so encouraged our
[1:25:14] hearts. Father, I just pray and ask Lord
[1:25:16] that you just take your vessel Lord and
[1:25:19] just use me for a few moments Lord that
[1:25:21] it can encourage your people. We love
[1:25:24] you now. We look to you in Jesus Christ
[1:25:26] name. Amen. You may be seated. With the
[1:25:29] help of the Lord, I'd like to take a
[1:25:30] little topic here. Hope
[1:25:34] versus faith.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Hope versus faith. Now, we all have
[1:25:40] things. We we've all been trusting God
[1:25:42] for things and we've trusted God for
[1:25:44] things in 2025 and some things God might
[1:25:47] have brought into manifestation. Other
[1:25:49] things we're still trusting him for. And
[1:25:51] may this year, the 2026 be the year for
[1:25:54] it. Amen.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; So now faith, I want to read it again.
[1:25:58] Faith is the substance of things you
[1:26:01] hope for. Now we're we're we're speaking
[1:26:02] tonight about faith versus hope. So if
[1:26:05] it's something versus something else,
[1:26:07] that means it's two different things.
[1:26:08] That's right.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; The faith is the substance of things you
[1:26:11] hope for, the evidence of things not
[1:26:15] seen.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us that faith is only
[1:26:20] real to God and the one who has it.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Faith is only real to God and the one
[1:26:32] who has it. Thank you, brother. Now we
[1:26:34] are a triune being soul, body and
[1:26:38] spirit. Every request we read the prayer
[1:26:40] request every single service whenever
[1:26:42] brother Matt or brother Andrew or the
[1:26:44] song leader asks how many have a have a
[1:26:46] request. Every single request we could
[1:26:49] possibly have is a need for our soul,
[1:26:52] our body, or our spirit. If it's for
[1:26:54] ourselves or maybe you're raising your
[1:26:56] hands for a loved one.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; If you've got a prodigal, if you've got
[1:26:59] a lost loved ones, it's for their soul.
[1:27:00] If you're facing depression, then it's
[1:27:02] for your spirit.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Every need or every desire ministers to
[1:27:07] something. Now, hope is also known as
[1:27:09] mental faith. Now, I want us to
[1:27:12] understand here. I don't want to put
[1:27:14] down hope. Hope is important. The Bible
[1:27:16] teaches us that there's three things.
[1:27:18] Faith, hope, and love. But the greatest
[1:27:21] of these is love. So, hope most
[1:27:23] definitely has a place. Hope is a
[1:27:26] believer.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Hope is not an unbeliever. Hope is not
[1:27:29] like Mr. skeptic or Mr. unbeliever or
[1:27:32] Mr. Makebeliever or Mr. impatience. Hope
[1:27:34] is a believer and our hope is in the
[1:27:37] Lord. Amen.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Our overall direction of life is our
[1:27:41] hope is in the Lord. If we get sick, our
[1:27:44] hope is that God is our healer.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; If everything is going well for you,
[1:27:49] you've got the joy of the Lord and
[1:27:50] you're on the mountain. Your hope is
[1:27:52] that if your heart gets broken, you know
[1:27:55] that God is your mener.
[1:27:58] If you're sitting here sanctified,
[1:28:00] filled with the Holy Ghost, your hope
[1:28:02] and our hope and we know and our trust
[1:28:04] is that if we sin, he's just to forgive
[1:28:08] us. That is our hope. And hope is a
[1:28:11] powerful thing. But now faith
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; gives us access to the things that we
[1:28:16] hope for
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; because remember as we read in the
[1:28:19] scripture, it is the faith is the
[1:28:21] substance of things that you are already
[1:28:24] hoping for. Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; It is the evidence of things that you
[1:28:29] don't need. So faith is accessing what
[1:28:31] you're hoping for but you need at the
[1:28:33] present time.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; You can you our hope is in the word.
[1:28:38] This is our hope. Our hope is in the
[1:28:40] Lord.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; But if you're healthy then you don't
[1:28:43] need faith to be healed, do you?
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; If you're lost, your hope is in the
[1:28:50] Lord. You need faith to be saved. That
[1:28:52] is the only way. Amen.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Now listen to this quote here.
[1:28:58] He said, "Brother Bram," in the ministry
[1:29:00] explained. He said, "I find that many
[1:29:02] people come to faith in kind of a
[1:29:04] haphazard way, if you'll excuse that
[1:29:06] expression. Kind of like they're making
[1:29:08] a guess at it. And 90% of the people
[1:29:11] that comes in the line have hope instead
[1:29:15] of faith."
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; That makes me throw my toes back in my
[1:29:20] shoes. Here you have a prophet of God
[1:29:23] with a with a discernment like the Lord
[1:29:25] Jesus Christ. And he discerns and he
[1:29:27] says 90% of people coming in the prayer
[1:29:30] line have hope instead of faith.
[1:29:35] He said now hope is one thing and faith
[1:29:38] is another.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Faith is a positive sense. It's not a
[1:29:43] guesswork. You don't just imagine it.
[1:29:46] Faith is just as real as any of the
[1:29:49] other five senses and more real
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; because it'll go in and above
[1:29:56] those five senses.
[1:29:58] He said and it serves we would see
[1:30:00] Jesus. He said faith is absolutely a
[1:30:02] substance not a hope. Faith is a is the
[1:30:05] substance of things hoped for. But when
[1:30:08] faith takes it, it becomes the substance
[1:30:12] that you hope for.
[1:30:14] See the evidence of things not seen.
[1:30:18] Remember, no one can see your faith, but
[1:30:20] you know it
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; and God knows it.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; It's so real.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; It's so real to the person that has it,
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; but they can't show it to anybody else.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; But it's so real. It brings God down to
[1:30:37] you.
[1:30:40] It it makes God real to you and your
[1:30:43] situation.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; It's a million miles above hope, if I
[1:30:48] can say that.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Now, the definition of hope is to
[1:30:52] cherish or desire with anticipation.
[1:30:56] Now, see how that can mix us up
[1:30:59] because that can sound like faith.
[1:31:02] To want something to happen or to be
[1:31:06] true. Another another example or another
[1:31:08] definition is to desire with expectation
[1:31:12] of op of obtainment or fulfillment.
[1:31:15] You're expecting it.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Hope is of God.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Our hope is in the Lord.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; He said but the prophet of God in the
[1:31:25] third Exodus says now make believe now
[1:31:27] faith. Not make believe now faith. Not
[1:31:30] hope but faith. Hope is out there hoping
[1:31:34] it was in. Hope is expecting. God, I'm
[1:31:37] I'm expecting it. He says, "But faith is
[1:31:40] already in."
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Already in looking out, you've got it.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Faith is your excuse me, hope is your
[1:31:54] hoping, your anticipation. God, if you
[1:31:56] can only do this for me,
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; I know you can do it because I read it
[1:31:59] in your word. You've got hope.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; You're not hopeless. You've got hope.
[1:32:04] But faith says, "Thank you, Lord.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I've got it already."
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Faith is already looking in,
[1:32:13] looking out, and saying it's done."
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; See, that's faith.
[1:32:19] Now, faith is also called a key.
[1:32:23] He says, "Now Jesus is the door to all
[1:32:26] things."
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; And faith is the key that unlocks that
[1:32:32] door.
[1:32:35] Now, if Jesus is the door to all these
[1:32:38] promises of God, faith in his finished
[1:32:41] work unlocks every door to every
[1:32:44] treasure there is inside the kingdom of
[1:32:46] God.
[1:32:48] See it? Faith is the key that unlocks
[1:32:52] every promise he makes. The key of faith
[1:32:55] does that. Faith in his finished work.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Now, hope is believing that it's behind
[1:33:01] the door.
[1:33:04] Faith is saying, excuse me, hope is
[1:33:06] saying everything I need is this. I need
[1:33:09] this. I'm trusting God for this. And
[1:33:11] it's behind that door. You believe it.
[1:33:15] But faith gives you the key to say, "I
[1:33:18] need it."
[1:33:21] And you open that door
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; and Jesus is the door.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; You walk in there.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; I need healing.
[1:33:32] I need peace of mind.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; I need the joy of the Lord.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; And you come out and you've got
[1:33:41] something.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Why? Not because of you're just sitting
[1:33:48] there knocking. You take opportunity of
[1:33:51] your moment. You you unlock you get the
[1:33:54] faith that God gives you and you put the
[1:33:56] key in and you turn it. You get access
[1:33:59] behind the door.
[1:34:03] That's faith.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; But hope is saying, "My goodness,
[1:34:06] everything I have need of is right
[1:34:08] there.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; I'm so hungry and all the food and all
[1:34:12] all the all the ribeye is right behind
[1:34:14] that refrigerator door. All the
[1:34:16] vegetables, all the fruits, everything I
[1:34:18] need for nutrition, all the vitamins is
[1:34:20] right behind that door. I'm so hungry.
[1:34:21] It's all there. I know it's there and I
[1:34:23] believe it." Then put your faith and
[1:34:25] open the door.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Get what you need.
[1:34:31] Now, every scripture has power behind
[1:34:33] it.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; In my simplistic mind, every scripture
[1:34:37] is like a little mini door.
[1:34:40] And you need something and you [snorts]
[1:34:42] see that door and every scripture is the
[1:34:44] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; And you see it and you need it, grab a
[1:34:49] hold of it.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Don't just say, "Well, amen. I believe
[1:34:52] it. It's there." Let it come off of
[1:34:55] there.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Now, faith is a revelation.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; And when you have faith,
[1:35:03] nobody can take it away from you.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; No person, no devil in hell can ever
[1:35:11] talk a born again believer out of this
[1:35:13] message.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not just a hope. It is
[1:35:18] a faith.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; They've literally met God for
[1:35:21] themselves.
[1:35:24] So because the new birth is a
[1:35:27] revelation, it literally becomes a part
[1:35:29] of you. But now an intellectual believer
[1:35:30] can be swayed.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Talked into the message, talked out of
[1:35:34] the message, talked into the message,
[1:35:36] talked out of the message.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; But a real message believer born again
[1:35:42] can never
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; ever
[1:35:47] lose their faith.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; The message is not our hope. It is our
[1:35:52] faith.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Real faith can never move.
[1:35:58] Remember Paul said in 1 Corinthians
[1:36:00] 12:3, "Wherefore I give you to
[1:36:02] understand that no man speaking by the
[1:36:04] spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and
[1:36:06] that no man can say that Jesus is the
[1:36:09] Lord but by the Holy Ghost."
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Until then it's a mental faith. Until
[1:36:16] then you're saying that Jesus Christ
[1:36:18] rose from the dead because the preacher
[1:36:19] says it. because the Sunday school says
[1:36:21] it, because your parents say it, and
[1:36:23] that's the way it should be. Keep
[1:36:25] repeating it. Keep believing it. Don't
[1:36:27] lose your hope.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; But whenever you meet him for yourself,
[1:36:30] brother Jeremy, then you know
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; he rose from the dead.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Now faith will bring you rest.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; It'll bring you a peace.
[1:36:46] The prophet tells us that the Christian
[1:36:48] faith is based solidly solidly upon
[1:36:51] rest.
[1:36:53] He said that's right. A Christian is not
[1:36:55] tossed about. A Christian doesn't run
[1:36:56] from place to place. A Christian doesn't
[1:36:58] fuss and fume and worry about things. A
[1:37:00] Christian rests. It's all over.
[1:37:05] It was all finished for the believer at
[1:37:07] Calvary.
[1:37:11] So if the Christian faith is based on
[1:37:14] rest, so is all faith, real perfect
[1:37:17] faith I'm speaking of here. Because
[1:37:19] remember, the prophet tells us that
[1:37:20] faith has its resting place on the word.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; It doesn't rest on our emotions. It
[1:37:26] doesn't it doesn't rest on our feelings.
[1:37:28] It doesn't rest on our symptoms. Now
[1:37:31] hope or also mental faith has got a
[1:37:34] labor to it. It can be a spiritual
[1:37:36] roller coaster.
[1:37:39] We come to church, we hear the word of
[1:37:41] God, man, we're on the mountaintop.
[1:37:44] Then we go out during the middle of the
[1:37:46] week and we face our challenges and all
[1:37:47] of a sudden the enemy attacks us
[1:37:51] and we need more encouragement
[1:37:54] and we do need encouragement.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; We do need encouragement. That's why we
[1:37:59] come to the house of God. But hope is a
[1:38:02] labor. You we it it makes us have to
[1:38:04] constantly keep ourselves in the right
[1:38:05] channel. Our ups and downs affect our
[1:38:07] faith.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Your mood, our moods are affected by the
[1:38:13] circumstances, by our senses, by by by
[1:38:15] by how how our days going.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Faith can be around every bit of that
[1:38:21] and still be at peace and immovable.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Faith does not is it's not that well,
[1:38:27] you have faith and you're and you're
[1:38:29] feeling bad and your senses are
[1:38:31] declaring that you're feeling bad. Faith
[1:38:33] is not saying, "Oh, you know, I'm I'm
[1:38:35] not actually coughing."
[1:38:38] It's thanking God for healing you while
[1:38:40] you're coughing.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Faith has a rest. You're not sidetracked
[1:38:47] by situations, circumstances.
[1:38:51] Paul tells us in the scriptures to
[1:38:53] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:38:55] thou shalt be saved and thy house.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; What are we to do with our prodigals and
[1:39:01] lost loved ones? Commit them to the
[1:39:03] Lord.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; You have faith. Say, "Lord, they're
[1:39:06] yours."
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; You know, when Jesus went home with
[1:39:08] Zakius, he didn't preach to him.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; He let Z Jesus let his own atmosphere
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; do all the preaching.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; And what did Zakius say? He said he said
[1:39:20] that he he was changed.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Everything I've ever
[1:39:24] stolen, I'll give back."
[1:39:26] Now the success of brother Ram's first
[1:39:28] and second pull was hinged on people
[1:39:31] believing that he was sent from God. Get
[1:39:34] the angel told him get the people to
[1:39:37] believe you
[1:39:39] and not even cancer can stand in your
[1:39:41] way. That's why the gift was sent. It
[1:39:44] was not the gift itself brother and
[1:39:46] sister did not heal anybody. It elevated
[1:39:49] their faith
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; to make them aware to seize their
[1:39:52] opportunity to that they were in the
[1:39:54] presence of God and that's what would
[1:39:56] heal them.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Remember Jesus God himself could not do
[1:40:02] in in Matthew 13:58 and many mighty
[1:40:04] works he could not and he did not many
[1:40:07] many mighty works because of their
[1:40:10] unbelief.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; It all comes down to your faith. That's
[1:40:16] how people lost their healing and turn
[1:40:19] into critics. They'd come, they they
[1:40:21] would witness the presence of God. They
[1:40:23] would reach out and touch God. Their
[1:40:25] blinded eyes would come open. They would
[1:40:26] leave. They maybe get sicker
[1:40:29] and they would start backing up.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; And it came right up on them.
[1:40:36] Faith is only real to God and the one
[1:40:38] who have it has it. Now, let me say this
[1:40:41] right here.
[1:40:43] Never judge or criticize somebody
[1:40:48] for an extended trial, sickness, or
[1:40:51] situation
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; or condition because you don't think
[1:40:55] they have enough faith.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; They could be having more faith than you
[1:41:01] have.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Because remember, faith is a rest.
[1:41:06] Whenever whenever you really believe God
[1:41:08] and you've got faith that's going to
[1:41:09] happen, the time element all of a sudden
[1:41:11] is not so important anymore because you
[1:41:14] know it's done. Whenever God does it,
[1:41:16] he's going to do it. My worrying, my
[1:41:18] fredding, my my anxiety is over.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; So don't judge Brother Ron because he
[1:41:26] takes chemo.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Don't judge Brother Ron because he goes
[1:41:30] to doctors. He's got faith.
[1:41:34] [applause]
[1:41:38] You look at Abraham
[1:41:40] called the father of our faith. He
[1:41:41] waited for 25 years. In the in the
[1:41:43] Bible, Paul said he got stronger.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Well, today, this is the second year,
[1:41:48] and he's been testifying that he and
[1:41:49] Sarah are going to have a baby. Abraham
[1:41:51] ain't got no faith. He's lying.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God said he got
[1:41:55] stronger.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; As soon as God promised Abraham, he
[1:42:01] began to make doctor arrangements. He
[1:42:03] got the crib and the baby room ready. He
[1:42:04] began to testify that he was going to be
[1:42:06] a father of nations.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; When God spoke to him and told him that
[1:42:11] that was Abraham's sacred says
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; and one day
[1:42:17] an angel passed through the neighborhood
[1:42:20] [applause]
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; and confirmed the word that Abraham
[1:42:23] believed.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; You keep believing. You keep holding on.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; You be at rest. You let your faith rest
[1:42:31] in his word. And one day an angel is
[1:42:33] going to come through your neighborhood
[1:42:35] and confirm exactly what you've been
[1:42:37] believing, what you've been testifying
[1:42:39] the whole time.
[1:42:42] [applause]
[1:42:43] Now, in this great in this great faith
[1:42:45] chapter, Peter uh Paul, excuse me,
[1:42:47] speaking here says in 11:13, "These all
[1:42:49] died in faith, not having received the
[1:42:52] promises, but having seen them a far
[1:42:54] off, and were persuaded of them and
[1:42:56] embraced them." Died in faith. I thought
[1:42:58] faith. Yes. Abraham confessed that he
[1:43:03] was seeking a city
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; whose builder and maker was God. Well,
[1:43:07] how could he confess such a thing?
[1:43:09] Because he met the king of the city.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; And when he went from this world into
[1:43:14] the next, he actually went there.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; The same faith that he had to to to
[1:43:21] bring Isaac to reality,
[1:43:25] he met the same king. Job died in in
[1:43:28] faith and said, "Though the skin worms
[1:43:31] destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall
[1:43:33] I see God." Joseph died in faith. Said,
[1:43:36] "God's going to visit you, and when he
[1:43:37] does, bring my bones out of here." When
[1:43:40] Jesus knocked on the door of paradise,
[1:43:43] they all recognized him because they
[1:43:45] died in faith.
[1:43:47] Brother Ron is taking the medicine in
[1:43:49] faith.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; He's going to the doctor office in
[1:43:52] faith.
[1:43:55] Sister Wanda takes the took the medicine
[1:43:57] in faith.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham died in faith. God
[1:44:02] didn't take him home because he didn't
[1:44:04] have enough faith for a rapture.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; That was God's a lotment. His work was
[1:44:10] done and God took him home.
[1:44:13] The
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; woman with the blood issue,
[1:44:19] she got a personal revelation in her
[1:44:21] heart that if she could just touch the
[1:44:25] hem of his garment.
[1:44:28] She'd heard about the miracles and it
[1:44:30] gave her hope. But one day it was
[1:44:32] revealed to her in faith, I got to touch
[1:44:35] him.
[1:44:37] She didn't have any scriptural examples,
[1:44:40] but it was personally revealed to her
[1:44:44] that regardless of what anybody said,
[1:44:46] regardless of all the social stigma of
[1:44:47] her of her condition,
[1:44:50] she had to touch him. And she knew that
[1:44:52] if she could only touch him,
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; she would be healed.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; She didn't need anyone to acknowledge
[1:44:59] her. It even took Jesus by surprise.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; He was going to lay hands on Jaras's
[1:45:05] daughter. Right. Amen.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; And you can imagine I can just imagine a
[1:45:09] crowd kind of parted open and he's going
[1:45:11] through and if and if you can just go
[1:45:13] back in time and look and you see people
[1:45:15] oh master come this way and the critics
[1:45:17] and all of a sudden you see a hand
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; just touch him
[1:45:24] draw back.
[1:45:26] She didn't need a notoriety. She didn't
[1:45:29] need anybody to pat her on the back. She
[1:45:30] didn't need a big bugle horn to say this
[1:45:32] lady touched you. She's got faith. She
[1:45:33] was getting she felt within herself that
[1:45:36] it stopped
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; and she was getting ready to leave
[1:45:41] and Jesus says somebody touched me
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; all the thousands and of people there
[1:45:49] and hundreds of hands that were touching
[1:45:51] him. He said somebody touch me.
[1:46:00] No prophet told her to do that.
[1:46:04] No scripture even told her to do that.
[1:46:06] That is how powerful brother Doug faith
[1:46:09] is.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Nobody had to prop her up, had to pump
[1:46:13] her up, had to keep her up.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; She heard
[1:46:18] of all the miracles that he did. And she
[1:46:21] had hope.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; But she needed more than hope
[1:46:26] because she only had a certain amount of
[1:46:28] time to live.
[1:46:31] She needed faith.
[1:46:36] Now, I'll say this.
[1:46:38] If you've been when you when you've been
[1:46:40] walking with God and you've experienced
[1:46:43] some things, [snorts]
[1:46:46] you have hope.
[1:46:50] But then when when one day maybe at the
[1:46:53] preaching of a word, at preaching of the
[1:46:55] word,
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; hearing of the word of maybe hearing the
[1:46:58] prophet or hearing one of these brothers
[1:47:00] preach, you can feel a transition.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; And it's so powerful.
[1:47:10] Now remember, we're not to judge one
[1:47:12] another. We're to judge ourselves. Lord,
[1:47:14] am I in hope
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; or am I in faith?
[1:47:20] [snorts]
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; And whenever whenever whenever God
[1:47:23] really drops something in your heart,
[1:47:28] you can feel the transition.
[1:47:33] You've got it.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; You can't show it to anybody, but you've
[1:47:38] got it. [snorts]
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; There's symptoms. There's voices all
[1:47:43] around. There's no all the all of the
[1:47:45] all of your reasoning would tell you
[1:47:47] it's not possible.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; But you've got it anyway.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; It is an evidence
[1:47:58] that you can't see with your natural
[1:48:01] eyes.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; It is an evidence that you can't show
[1:48:05] somebody else. But that evidence,
[1:48:08] sisters too, will draw God right down.
[1:48:12] to your situation.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Just like the prophet of God whenever he
[1:48:20] he had filio love and he loved
[1:48:22] everybody. But whenever the maniac came
[1:48:25] up there to knock
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; him to kingdom come as we would say, he
[1:48:29] said, "I felt something change
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; from just a humanistic love." He felt
[1:48:36] the agape love just step in.
[1:48:41] Now, we know, and I'm trying to wind
[1:48:43] this up. I'm running out of time.
[1:48:45] We know as message believers that thus
[1:48:48] sayeth the Lord has never failed.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; If brother Brandon was standing right
[1:48:54] here behind this pullpit right now and
[1:48:57] proclaimed thus sayaeth the Lord over
[1:48:59] your life,
[1:49:01] no matter how bad your circumstance,
[1:49:04] your situation would be as message
[1:49:07] believers, we would believe it, wouldn't
[1:49:09] we?
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; No matter how bad.
[1:49:15] But you see, perfect faith gives you the
[1:49:18] same assurance.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm trying to say to you.
[1:49:24] Perfect faith,
[1:49:26] real faith, is thus sayaith the Lord
[1:49:30] personally revealed to you
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; about any situation. When you have thus
[1:49:37] sayeth the Lord,
[1:49:39] you're at rest.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't have to struggle anymore.
[1:49:50] One day in service I was we had the
[1:49:52] chairs up here,
[1:49:58] you know, and
[1:50:03] Rebecca was getting of age as a teenager
[1:50:06] [snorts]
[1:50:08] and she was a good girl, always has
[1:50:09] been. But we knew she needed an
[1:50:12] experience with God.
[1:50:15] And [snorts] she was she was on our
[1:50:18] hearts. Gabriel man's heart.
[1:50:21] And we've been praying. We've been
[1:50:22] praying for we've been praying for. And
[1:50:23] brother Andrew was up here preaching.
[1:50:25] And he was preaching about the Memphis
[1:50:27] girl.
[1:50:30] And without even realizing what he was
[1:50:32] doing, he he just spun around. He said,
[1:50:33] "Don't you worry about your daughter.
[1:50:36] She's going to find her father."
[1:50:40] I heard because of what was on my heart
[1:50:42] and and and what I was praying for and
[1:50:44] the hope that I had when I I heard I
[1:50:47] heard the voice of God. I didn't hear
[1:50:49] brother Andrew. I heard the voice of God
[1:50:52] and that settled it for us.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; That settled it for us.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; And several months later again, Brother
[1:50:59] Andrew preaching, God gave her the Holy
[1:51:02] Ghost.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; But after I heard that word of the Lord
[1:51:07] to me, it settled it. I didn't worry. We
[1:51:09] didn't worry about it no more. We were
[1:51:11] at rest. [applause]
[1:51:17] It gives you a peace that passes all
[1:51:20] understanding.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; How do we get more faith?
[1:51:25] Paul said, "Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:51:27] hearing by the word of God." But it's
[1:51:29] not the hearing we do with our ears.
[1:51:30] It's the hearing we do with our heart
[1:51:32] and soul. It's the same kind of hearing
[1:51:34] that Jesus said, "He that has ears to
[1:51:36] hear, let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:51:38] to the to the church." A few weeks ago,
[1:51:41] I was listening to Brother Brandham
[1:51:44] and just kind of going through some
[1:51:46] things and I could literally feel faith
[1:51:51] going straight to my soul.
[1:51:53] not not as background noise or you know
[1:51:56] and and things and and and that's one
[1:51:58] thing but it was I could feel you know
[1:52:01] when we hear the prophet we believe it
[1:52:03] but this was a special moment where I
[1:52:05] could feel faith
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; brother Thomas coming off through the
[1:52:10] speakers into my heart I could feel it
[1:52:13] coming in
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; faith cometh by hearing
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; I'd like to close it with this quote
[1:52:23] God has no substitute for his word. It's
[1:52:27] eternal and forever. God has no nothing
[1:52:30] to substitute faith. Faith has no
[1:52:33] substitute. Hope will never take the
[1:52:36] place of faith.
[1:52:38] Faith is alone. It stands alone.
[1:52:42] Hope can never take its place. Faith is
[1:52:45] the substance of things hoped for, the
[1:52:48] evidence of things not seen. See, hope
[1:52:50] is one thing and faith is another. Hope
[1:52:54] hopes for it.
[1:52:56] Faith has got it.
[1:52:59] One is intellectual faith and the other
[1:53:03] is a direct revelation of God.
[1:53:06] It'll never take its place.
[1:53:09] When God gives you a faith on the
[1:53:11] matter, it's God's gift to you.
[1:53:14] Just like revel the revelation of this
[1:53:15] message, of this word, Brother Gabe is
[1:53:17] God's gift to you.
[1:53:20] cuz other people hear it and they don't
[1:53:21] get it.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; So if you've got something, we're going
[1:53:25] into this next year. We already are. And
[1:53:28] you're trusting God and you got a list
[1:53:29] of things. God, I want to see this one
[1:53:31] saved. I want to see I want this for
[1:53:32] myself. I want you to heal me and all
[1:53:34] these things. Pray that God anchors such
[1:53:37] a faith.
[1:53:39] And if your faith is to come up and get
[1:53:41] prayed for and we'll lay hands on you to
[1:53:43] fulfill the scripture, then just let
[1:53:44] that be the spot. If your faith is to
[1:53:47] where you can just hear the word and
[1:53:48] receive it, let that be your spot.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; If your faith is to come to an altar and
[1:53:53] give your heart to God, let that be the
[1:53:55] spot. If your faith is to just hear the
[1:53:57] word and you're in your car and you hear
[1:53:59] and and you just give your life to God,
[1:54:00] let that wherever the spot is,
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; let it be real faith.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's send to our feet.
[1:54:07] There's that song,
[1:54:10] it's already done.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; The battle is over. The victory's been
[1:54:14] won.
[1:54:15] It's already done. I'm already healed.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; My family is sealed.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; The battle is over. The victory is
[1:54:25] already done. My family is sealed.
[1:54:29] Before I turn the service back to
[1:54:30] brother Andrew, let me say, "Brother
[1:54:33] William, why don't you ever sing?"
[1:54:36] Bible [snorts] says, "Make a joyful
[1:54:37] noise unto the Lord."
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; It does.
[1:54:42] [snorts] Brother David also says to play
[1:54:43] skillfully.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to go over there and make
[1:54:48] a joyful noise unto the Lord. I'm going
[1:54:51] let brother Andrew and these musicians
[1:54:52] play skillfully
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; and praise the Lord. Amen. God bless
[1:54:56] you. We love you. [applause]
[1:55:03] [applause]
[1:55:04] Oh, it's already done.
[1:55:09] Oh, it's already done.
[1:55:14] [music]
[1:55:17] Oh, [singing]
[1:55:18] the battle [music]
[1:55:20] is over.
[1:55:23] The victory is won.
[1:55:28] Oh, it's already
[1:55:30] [singing] done.
[1:55:32] I'm already healed. [music]
[1:55:35] Let faith say it. Oh, I'm already
[1:55:39] [singing] here. [music]
[1:55:46] Oh, [singing]
[1:55:47] I'm already here. [music]
[1:55:57] The battle is over.
[1:56:02] The [music] victory
[1:56:04] is won.
[1:56:06] Oh, I'm already
[1:56:09] healed.
[1:56:12] [music and singing]
[1:56:15] Oh,
[1:56:17] my family
[1:56:19] is [music and singing]
[1:56:20] here.
[1:56:25] Oh, [singing]
[1:56:26] my family is here.
[1:56:35] Oh,
[1:56:36] the battle [singing and music]
[1:56:38] is over.
[1:56:41] The victory [singing] is one.
[1:56:46] The family [music]
[1:56:48] is sealed.
[1:56:52] It's already done. As brother Ron Vess
[1:56:55] makes his [music] way. Oh, it's already
[1:56:58] done.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:57:06] it's already
[1:57:08] [music] done.
[1:57:14] Oh, [singing] the battle [music]
[1:57:17] is over.
[1:57:20] The victory [music and singing]
[1:57:22] is won.
[1:57:26] It's already [singing] done.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it one more time. It's
[1:57:32] already done. Oh, [singing]
[1:57:35] it's [music] all already done.
[1:57:44] Oh, [music]
[1:57:45] it's already
[1:57:47] done.
[1:57:53] Oh,
[1:57:55] the battle [music]
[1:57:56] is over. [singing]
[1:58:00] The victory
[1:58:02] is won.
[1:58:05] It's already [music and singing] done.
[1:58:10] The Bible says in Matthew 18 and [music]
[1:58:12] 19 as they play that again I say unto
[1:58:15] you that if two of you shall agree on
[1:58:18] earth as touching [music] anything that
[1:58:21] they shall ask, it shall be done for
[1:58:24] them of my father which is in heaven.
[1:58:27] for where two or three are gathered
[1:58:28] [music] together in my name, there I am
[1:58:31] in the midst of them.
[1:58:34] We've already [music] heard two powerful
[1:58:35] services,
[1:58:37] powerful sermons, powerful statements,
[1:58:40] powerful announcements. [music]
[1:58:42] And this is just a little bit different
[1:58:44] how I was just waiting on the Lord for
[1:58:46] this moment.
[1:58:49] And uh we've already heard to take
[1:58:50] advantage of a moment.
[1:58:53] And faith [music] is going to just step
[1:58:54] into the door. And it depends on what
[1:58:57] kind of faith you got, what you walk out
[1:58:59] with. [music]
[1:59:00] Brother Ron had called me uh last week
[1:59:03] or a week and a half ago and [music] and
[1:59:05] the Lord had placed on his heart to have
[1:59:06] a special prayer for brother Ron. And I
[1:59:08] said, "Well, brother, the Lord's laid
[1:59:10] some to do the same thing on my heart."
[1:59:13] [music]
[1:59:13] And uh we'd like to have special prayer
[1:59:17] and I just feel like this is the right
[1:59:18] moment after hearing [music] hearing
[1:59:20] this powerful message on faith just to
[1:59:23] have all the brothers if they wouldn't
[1:59:24] mind just coming down. We'll have
[1:59:26] brother Ron and I'm going to invite
[1:59:28] brother Ron to just pray over brother
[1:59:30] Ron. He feels led to do that and all of
[1:59:32] all the [music] brothers if they
[1:59:32] wouldn't mind brother Ron just come down
[1:59:35] just pray for our brother.
[1:59:40] Heat. Heat.
[1:59:51] [music]

[2:04:40] blessings you give.
[2:04:45] Although [singing] you've been [music]
[2:04:47] faithful and true
[2:04:53] with mercies brand [music] new,
[2:04:58] but because there is [singing] no
[2:05:01] [music] one above you,
[2:05:06] just because [singing] you are God,
[2:05:12] We [music] worship
[2:05:15] [singing]
[2:05:17] you.
[2:05:20] We worship
[2:05:25] you. [music]

[2:05:36] We honor
[2:05:40] you.
[2:05:43] We worship you.
[2:05:47] Oh, [music]
[2:05:48] simply because you [singing] are God,
[2:05:54] [music]
[2:05:55] uncreated [singing]
[2:05:57] and holy. You are, [music]
[2:06:03] oh, the maker [singing]
[2:06:05] of all that there is.
[2:06:11] the judge over all.
[2:06:17] And because [singing] there is no one
[2:06:21] above you,
[2:06:24] just because you [singing and music] are
[2:06:27] God,
[2:06:30] we worship
[2:06:33] [singing]
[2:06:34] [music] you.
[2:06:38] We [singing] worship
[2:06:42] you.
[2:06:46] We honor
[2:06:50] you. Yes, we do. [singing]
[2:06:54] We honor
[2:06:58] you.
[2:06:59] [singing]

[2:07:38] and ending, [singing]
[2:07:39] creator
[2:07:41] and ruler
[2:07:43] of all that is seen.
[2:07:45] and never will be the
[2:07:47] [music and singing] giver
[2:07:49] of blessings,
[2:07:51] the source of all power.
[2:07:55] All wisdom [music and singing]
[2:07:57] is from you. Let every knee bow and
[2:08:01] everyone shout. [singing]
[2:08:05] [music]
[2:08:09] Hallelujah.
[2:08:11] I want you to [music] worship the Lord
[2:08:13] Jesus right there where you are.
[2:08:17] I want you to [music] worship him with
[2:08:18] everything that's within you.
[2:08:21] Say, [singing] "All [music] blessing,
[2:08:24] all honor,
[2:08:26] all glory,
[2:08:28] all power,
[2:08:30] all strength, and [music and singing]
[2:08:32] all wisdom.

[2:08:42] beginning
[2:08:44] and ending,
[2:08:46] creator
[2:08:48] and ruler. [music]
[2:08:50] of all that is seen ever will be.
[2:08:53] [singing]
[2:08:57] We worship
[2:09:00] [singing]
[2:09:02] you.
[2:09:05] We worship
[2:09:08] [singing]
[2:09:10] you.
[2:09:13] We [singing] honor

[2:10:20] such an awesome
[2:10:22] God who's so [music and singing]
[2:10:25] selfless,
[2:10:28] who's so generous.
[2:10:33] So faithful [singing]

[2:11:13] brave.
[2:11:15] Oh, such an awesome [music] God.

[2:12:13] God.
[2:12:15] So selfless,
[2:12:20] so cheerous,
[2:12:25] so faithful
[2:12:27] you are.
[2:12:35] What a wonderful presence here this
[2:12:37] evening.
[2:12:41] we could finish [music]
[2:12:42] close the book and say we have seen God
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; and he's ministered to us.
[2:12:51] [music] So in 2026
[2:12:53] we just want to encourage you
[2:12:57] take [music] every advantage
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; of every time every moment that you get
[2:13:03] with him
[2:13:05] for he is faithful.
[2:13:08] He's faithful to meet each [music] and
[2:13:10] every one of your desires here.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[2:13:16] This evening, I would like to turn to
[2:13:18] First Corinthians 15:51
[2:13:21] and just take a little thought here just
[2:13:23] for a moment.
[2:13:28] I want to keep that same atmosphere,
[2:13:30] that same presence that's here this
[2:13:32] evening.
[2:13:35] I don't want to take anything away. I
[2:13:37] just want to have a word that would just
[2:13:40] encourage you to add on to what these
[2:13:42] fine men of God has ministered to you
[2:13:44] this evening.
[2:13:49] Verse 51 says, "Behold, I will show you
[2:13:51] a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but
[2:13:55] we shall be changed in a moment, in a
[2:13:58] twinkling of an eye, at the last trump.
[2:14:00] For the trump shall sound, and the dead
[2:14:03] shall be raised incorruptible, and we
[2:14:06] shall be changed.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; For this corruption must be must put on
[2:14:11] incorruption, and this mortal must be
[2:14:14] put on immortality. So when this
[2:14:16] corruptible shall put on incorruption,
[2:14:19] and this mortal shall have put on
[2:14:21] immortality, then shall be brought to
[2:14:24] pass the saying that is written, death
[2:14:27] is swallowed up in victory.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Oh death, where is thy
[2:14:34] sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?
[2:14:38] The sting of death is sin, and the
[2:14:41] strength of sin is the law. But thanks
[2:14:44] be to God,
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; which giveth the victory through who?
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:14:54] Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye
[2:14:57] steadfast,
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; unmovable, always abounding in the work
[2:15:02] of the Lord. For as much as ye know that
[2:15:05] your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads. Dear heavenly
[2:15:12] father, Lord, Lord, we're asking you
[2:15:15] that you'll just lift these words off
[2:15:16] the pages, Lord. Lord, we can hear them.
[2:15:20] We can feel them, Lord, but we want them
[2:15:22] to become living in us, God. No, God, as
[2:15:25] I speak, God, you just let me step
[2:15:27] aside. You fill this vessel, Lord, and
[2:15:29] speak to the people here this evening.
[2:15:31] Bless them, Lord. Lord, for every effort
[2:15:33] they've made to be here this evening.
[2:15:35] Everyone that's put aside things, Lord,
[2:15:37] we we worship you this evening, God. We
[2:15:40] thank you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:15:43] And you can be seated [snorts] at this
[2:15:45] time.
[2:15:53] Tonight I want to take uh my text from
[2:15:56] be ye steadfast.
[2:15:59] We have Paul here that is uh writing to
[2:16:02] the Corinthians the resurrection of
[2:16:05] Jesus Christ. For we have our hope in
[2:16:07] this. Therefore, my beloved brethren,
[2:16:11] he's speaking to them in a personal
[2:16:13] sense.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; He loves them.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Be ye steadfast
[2:16:19] where we're taking our text. Unmovable,
[2:16:21] always abounding in the work of the
[2:16:23] Lord. For as much as ye know that your
[2:16:25] labor is not in vain in the Lord. We're
[2:16:29] into this new year, 2026.
[2:16:31] 2025 is faded. It's gone. There is
[2:16:34] nothing else that we can do in 2025.
[2:16:37] But there is things that we can do in
[2:16:39] 2026.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; We can be steadfast in the Lord.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; Many people will talk about new goals.
[2:16:46] Many people will talk about new
[2:16:48] strengths, new beginnings. But most of
[2:16:51] us did not come out of 2025
[2:16:54] with strengths. We came out tired, worn
[2:16:58] down, grieving, still waiting on
[2:17:00] answers, still fighting sicknesses,
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; still carrying burdens from 2025. They
[2:17:08] did not disappear at the strike of
[2:17:10] midnight.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; We still have all of those things.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; As the Corinthians church, they was
[2:17:18] fighting against false teachings and
[2:17:20] things. And Paul would stand there and
[2:17:22] teach them the gospel, the way you
[2:17:24] should be, the resurrection of Jesus
[2:17:26] Christ, this hope that we have. Be ye
[2:17:29] steadfast, brethren. He's encouraged
[2:17:30] them in the Lord. I want to encourage
[2:17:32] you in the Lord this evening. Be ye
[2:17:34] steadfast through 2026.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Things might not always go our way, but
[2:17:39] be ye steadfast.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; In high school, we had this program for
[2:17:44] football. It was bigger, faster,
[2:17:46] stronger. Bigger, faster, stronger. We
[2:17:48] wanted to be bigger, faster, stronger
[2:17:50] the next day, the next week, the next
[2:17:52] month. We was planning ahead to be
[2:17:54] bigger, faster, stronger. Now, I'm not
[2:17:57] talking about being bigger, faster,
[2:17:58] stronger in the gospel at this moment.
[2:18:01] I'm talking about you being steady.
[2:18:03] There's a lot of people that will come
[2:18:04] to the the Lord. They'll be like a a
[2:18:07] fire on a windy day just blowing then.
[2:18:10] That's what exactly we want to be. But
[2:18:12] the thing is is you need to be steadfast
[2:18:14] through it.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of them. I've seen them
[2:18:17] that we've had guys come here two weeks
[2:18:19] they're ready to preach. They've been
[2:18:20] out to the bar two weeks ago, but
[2:18:22] they're ready to preach two weeks from
[2:18:23] now.
[2:18:25] Now, that's good. But two weeks later,
[2:18:27] they wasn't even in church.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; They weren't steadfast.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; They didn't really catch it. I'm telling
[2:18:34] you, be steadfast.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to tell you, steadfast is
[2:18:38] not stagnant. Steadfast is moving.
[2:18:41] Steadfast is holding true.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stagnant gets wiggle tails.
[2:18:47] Stagnant is where bass fish are. I I
[2:18:50] think the devil's a bass fisherman
[2:18:52] because he likes stagnant still water.
[2:18:54] He likes Christians that don't really
[2:18:56] have something that move them.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; But see, we're looking for that rainbow
[2:19:01] trout,
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; that little nibble, that little nimble.
[2:19:04] And here we go. We got you.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; The rainbow trout. That's what God's
[2:19:07] looking for.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stagnant is doing just bare
[2:19:11] minimum.
[2:19:13] just barely getting by.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; It's not steadfast.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be stagnant believers.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; We're steadfast believers. Unmovable,
[2:19:25] unshakable on this gospel.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; Steadfast is not flashy. It's not loud.
[2:19:31] It's faithful.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; Faithful, loyal, consistent, staunch.
[2:19:37] Steadfast is steady, unwavering course
[2:19:39] in love, allegiance on your convictions.
[2:19:42] It's resolute, a firm determination to
[2:19:45] adhere to the cause of purpose. We have
[2:19:47] a purpose and that is in Jesus.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; Just as I was saying, the Corinthians
[2:19:54] church had to fight false teachings and
[2:19:57] things of this age. You have to fight
[2:19:59] false teachings. You have to go through
[2:20:01] things. There is things at your
[2:20:03] doorstep, America.
[2:20:05] You might have seen martyrs and people
[2:20:08] across seas and things that would have
[2:20:09] happened and you said it may never be
[2:20:11] here, but I want to say it's at your
[2:20:13] doorstep, America.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; It's at your doorstep, Christians.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; You will fight things, so you better be
[2:20:20] steadfast in the gospel.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Be ye steadfast, holding true to this
[2:20:24] word.
[2:20:27] Brother Brandham would say it like this.
[2:20:29] And he swore by himself, which hope we
[2:20:32] have as an anchor of the soul, both sure
[2:20:34] and steadfast, not wavering about in
[2:20:37] every doctrine, every wind tossed about,
[2:20:40] from one side to another, taking sides
[2:20:42] over here, taking sides over here. Don't
[2:20:46] don't know where you stand. The Bible
[2:20:48] said, "I would that ye be established."
[2:20:52] Not saying, "Well, that I'm this today
[2:20:54] and I'm something else tomorrow." Anchor
[2:20:57] your soul in Christ Jesus.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Be born again.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; The life of God living in you and you
[2:21:05] know beyond a shadow of a doubt that
[2:21:07] you've passed from death unto life.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Your whole hopes is built upon yonder
[2:21:13] Calvary. The love of God pours through
[2:21:16] your heart and you believe every word
[2:21:18] that God says is truth. You're willing
[2:21:21] to die for any phase of it. Be willing
[2:21:25] to die for this gospel.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; See what I mean? Steadfast and sure.
[2:21:30] Don't be something tomorrow. Don't be
[2:21:32] something today and then be something
[2:21:34] tomorrow. Be steadfast on the gospel
[2:21:36] here.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Steadfast does not mean unbroken.
[2:21:41] Paul didn't say, "Be ye unheard."
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; He says, "Be ye steadfast."
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; Steadfast people still feel pain.
[2:21:51] I still feel pain. I come out of two
[2:21:53] back surgeries in 2025. I still feel
[2:21:55] some pain, but I'm still steadfast that
[2:21:58] I have my healing.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I have that faith.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; But don't let go of God.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; In the expositions of the church ages,
[2:22:10] it says, "Now before we close, I want to
[2:22:13] bring this thought. All along we have
[2:22:16] been talking about that seed of wheat
[2:22:18] being buried, then sending up two
[2:22:20] shoots, then the tassel, and then the
[2:22:23] true ear. This might make some of you
[2:22:25] wonder if if we said that the Lutherans
[2:22:28] didn't have the Holy Spirit just because
[2:22:30] they taught basic justification.
[2:22:33] And it might make some of you wonder
[2:22:35] about the Methodists, etc. No sir, we're
[2:22:37] not saying that. We're not talking about
[2:22:39] the individuals or the people, but the
[2:22:42] age. Lutheran had the spirit of God,
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; but his age is not the age of full
[2:22:48] restoration
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; by another outpouring like in the
[2:22:52] beginning. It was the same with Wesley,
[2:22:56] Booof, Knox, Wakefield, Bernard,
[2:22:58] Jonathan, Edwards, Mueller, etc. Surely
[2:23:02] we were surely they were full of the
[2:23:04] Holy Ghost. Yes, they were certainly
[2:23:07] were. But the age in which each was not
[2:23:10] the age of restoration. Neither was the
[2:23:13] age but this last age
[2:23:18] the age of complete blackout of
[2:23:20] apostasy. This is the age of apostasy
[2:23:23] and this is the age of full of
[2:23:26] restoration. It is the age of the
[2:23:28] finished cycle. Brother Brandham was
[2:23:30] saying here this is the age of the
[2:23:32] apostasy age. This is the age of
[2:23:34] complete blackout. And he would say it
[2:23:36] as he would go down through all of the
[2:23:38] church ages and it would come to that
[2:23:40] last church age and it would be
[2:23:42] completely dark and then it would just
[2:23:44] say just put a little bit of darkness in
[2:23:47] there, a little bit of light in there.
[2:23:49] You are that light. We are in the age of
[2:23:52] apostasy, a dark age. But let me tell
[2:23:54] you, he doesn't finish with that. He
[2:23:56] says this is the age of restoration.
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; The age of restoration for the bride.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. They couldn't do it in Wesley's
[2:24:06] age.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; We weren't there.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; They couldn't do it in Martin's age. We
[2:24:11] weren't there. We're not saying they
[2:24:13] didn't have the Holy Ghost to be able to
[2:24:15] take a rapture, but we had to finish our
[2:24:18] phase.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; We have to finish our cycle. We have to
[2:24:22] be steadfast on this word, on this age.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; It's going to be dark. Darkness has
[2:24:28] tried to creep in in every every step of
[2:24:30] the light way. It's tried to sweep in in
[2:24:32] every pullpit of this bride, but it will
[2:24:35] not creep in in this pull pit. It will
[2:24:38] be truth until the end time.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; In limitations 3 and22 and 23, it says,
[2:24:46] "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are
[2:24:49] not compass consumed because his
[2:24:53] compassions fail not."
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; They are new every morning. For great is
[2:25:00] thy faithfulness.
[2:25:02] Oh, thank you, Lord. Can you just say,
[2:25:04] "Thank you, Lord, for your faithfulness
[2:25:05] to me."
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Great is thy
[2:25:09] faithfulness.
[2:25:11] Great is our God.
[2:25:14] Yes, you may be ill in treatment. Yes,
[2:25:17] you may be praying over loved ones,
[2:25:19] grieving over your buried.
[2:25:23] but believing for healing and staying
[2:25:25] steadfast.
[2:25:27] Don't bend,
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; don't break. Steadfast is faithfulness
[2:25:33] in ordinary days.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Hey, we're country people here.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; We ain't a bunch of city slickers. We
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; We know how to get our hands dirty. We
[2:25:44] go through things.
[2:25:46] As families, you go through things,
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; but stay steadfast.
[2:25:51] Steadfast is getting up and doing what
[2:25:53] needs to be done.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; Showing up even when you don't feel like
[2:25:57] it.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; There's many times our pastor gets
[2:26:01] behind this pull pit. He may not feel
[2:26:03] like it,
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; but what an example of being steadfast,
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; being steadfast on the battlefield.
[2:26:11] [applause]
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; I could say it like many troops said.
[2:26:17] There's Stonewall Jackson standing in
[2:26:20] the field. There he is standing as an
[2:26:23] example.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; We have a true example of what steadfast
[2:26:28] looks like.
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; Steadfast, always abounding in the work
[2:26:35] of the Lord.
[2:26:37] It's everyday obedience. It's steady in
[2:26:40] planting. It's trusting God with results
[2:26:43] you may not see yet.
[2:26:46] Steadfast is healing is slow.
[2:26:51] Some prayers don't get answered quickly.
[2:26:53] Some miracles take some time. Some
[2:26:55] healings come in stages.
[2:26:58] And some
[2:27:03] some don't come the way we hoped.
[2:27:07] In Isaiah 26 it says,
[2:27:11] "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace
[2:27:14] whose mind is stayed on thee because he
[2:27:18] trustth in thee."
[2:27:21] All the things you're going through, he
[2:27:22] trustth in you.
[2:27:25] Trust ye in the Lord forever. For in the
[2:27:28] Lord Jehovah is our everlasting
[2:27:30] strength.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; Everlasting
[2:27:34] everlasting strength. It didn't say
[2:27:37] partially. It said your everlasting
[2:27:39] strength.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; We've heard it said before. God's delay
[2:27:44] is not God's absence.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; There's many prayers that we have sent
[2:27:50] up that we go, Lord, why aren't you
[2:27:52] answering them now?
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; But let me reassure you, God's delay is
[2:27:57] not God's absence on the situation.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:02] [applause]
[2:28:05] We know God has a time and a place for
[2:28:07] everything.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; Many times we want to be like farmers,
[2:28:11] but we want to pick up and look at
[2:28:13] what's growing.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; We'll plant it.
[2:28:17] Turn around. Did you do anything?
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; Nope. It's still not growing. You put it
[2:28:23] back in the ground. Well, if you
[2:28:25] continue to pull it back and you go,
[2:28:27] it's not going to grow. When you ask God
[2:28:30] to move on a situation, God's going to
[2:28:32] turn his ear and he's going to answer
[2:28:34] the situation on how he sees fit.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; I would have loved to have had the
[2:28:42] walked into the doctor's office, my
[2:28:44] first back surgery, and the doctor go,
[2:28:46] "Well, there's nothing wrong with you.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Well, you're healed.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; I I don't know." But it didn't happen
[2:28:53] that way. Many times what we go through
[2:28:56] is a testimony of our trials to someone
[2:29:00] else.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; A testimony that says you can continue
[2:29:04] on. You can go through this. You can
[2:29:07] overcome this.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; So God says keep believing. Keep
[2:29:12] praying. Keep trusting. Keep showing up.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; There's going to be days that you don't
[2:29:19] feel like getting in the car going to
[2:29:20] church.
[2:29:22] There's going to be days when you ache
[2:29:23] and you hurt and your family's sick.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; No. If they're flu sick, now you keep
[2:29:28] them home. We'll pray for you. You
[2:29:30] stream.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe in the anointing going
[2:29:35] through that web. Hallelujah.
[2:29:38] [applause]
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; But there's days that you don't feel
[2:29:42] like it.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:45] ba days that you got to have to take a
[2:29:47] step in faith
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; in the rapture and I'm going to be
[2:29:53] coming to a close here. Brother Brandham
[2:29:56] is getting a preview of the bride.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; He says, "And I remember that night.
[2:30:01] Therefore, I seen that I seen the
[2:30:04] preview of the bride. I stood there seen
[2:30:07] a beautiful little lady just correctly
[2:30:09] dressed things marching this way. There
[2:30:13] was somebody standing by me in the
[2:30:15] vision and I seen and they said the
[2:30:19] preview of the bride
[2:30:23] and I seen her go by and they come up
[2:30:26] this side and went around and I heard it
[2:30:29] coming and the church is coming from
[2:30:31] this other side and there come the Asian
[2:30:34] church. Oh, talk about filth. Here come
[2:30:38] the European church. Oh my. And then I
[2:30:40] heard the rock and roll coming and it
[2:30:42] was Miss America the church. And she
[2:30:46] didn't have a any clothes on.
[2:30:49] She had papers like newspapers gray
[2:30:52] holding in front of her dancing by the
[2:30:54] rocking and roll Miss America the
[2:30:56] church. And I stood there in the
[2:30:58] presence and I thought, "Oh God, as a
[2:31:00] minister, if that's the best we can do,
[2:31:04] oh, you don't know how he feels." Then I
[2:31:08] thought, God, hide me if I could just
[2:31:11] get away from here. If all that I've
[2:31:14] done that's that I've produced, if
[2:31:17] that's what and then when them women
[2:31:22] passed by, all them doing kinds of rocks
[2:31:24] and things, short hair, painted face,
[2:31:26] and they passed by like that, supposed
[2:31:28] to be virgins of Christ. And when they
[2:31:31] passed like that, I turned my head, you
[2:31:34] know, and with this holding in front of
[2:31:37] me and and it was a disgraceful on the
[2:31:41] back of them and there they was going
[2:31:44] like like that and I turned my head
[2:31:46] weeping like that and I said I couldn't
[2:31:48] stand it in there and him standing there
[2:31:52] and me you know as a minister of the
[2:31:55] church and that's what I had produced
[2:31:57] for him and I said oh God I can't look
[2:32:00] at it. Let me die. Let me just fade away
[2:32:03] like that. And as soon as I went out,
[2:32:07] every time one of them would come and
[2:32:09] they'd go out a certain place and then
[2:32:11] they just drop off. And I just hear the
[2:32:14] sound of it as it went away.
[2:32:18] And then I heard something like onward
[2:32:21] Christian soldiers.
[2:32:23] And I looked and here come the sainted
[2:32:26] bunch of little girls just exactly the
[2:32:29] way they was.
[2:32:31] All correctly dressed, their hair
[2:32:33] hanging way down and their back smooth
[2:32:36] and clinging and marching like this to
[2:32:39] the step of the gospel. She was the
[2:32:42] word.
[2:32:44] They looked like one out of every
[2:32:46] nation. And I was looking at it as they
[2:32:49] passed by. And I seen them pass. And
[2:32:52] instead of them going going down, they
[2:32:55] started going up.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; And I noticed them trying to one or two
[2:33:00] of them trying to get out of line. And I
[2:33:03] started screaming, "Stay in line. Stay
[2:33:06] in line." And the vision left me. And
[2:33:08] there I was standing screaming, "Stay in
[2:33:11] line. Stay in line." So little bride I
[2:33:14] want to tell you this evening.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; Stay in line. [applause and cheering]
[2:33:19] Your promise is not over.
[2:33:22] Stay steadfast.
[2:33:24] Stay in line, little bride. You're not
[2:33:27] going to be going down, but we're going
[2:33:29] to be taking a step. We're going to be
[2:33:31] taking a step upward. Staying steadfast
[2:33:35] on the word of the Lord that God has
[2:33:38] given us. Stay steadfast in what he's
[2:33:41] given us. Oh, everything that God had,
[2:33:45] he poured into Christ. And everything
[2:33:47] that Christ had, he poured into his
[2:33:50] church.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, he poured into you, little bride.
[2:33:54] Everything that was in him is in you
[2:33:56] this evening. Stay steadfast on the
[2:33:59] word. Oh, can you just give him praise
[2:34:02] in the house of God and say, "Thank you,
[2:34:04] Lord. Thank you, Lord, for standing with
[2:34:07] me, staying with me. When I thought all
[2:34:10] hope was lost in the darkest of times,
[2:34:13] you were steadfast with me. He was
[2:34:16] steadfast so I can say steadfast.
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's sing that song. He's faithful
[2:34:22] to the end. He's faithful to the end
[2:34:25] with us all. Lord,
[2:34:29] when I'm feeling [music and singing]
[2:34:30] afraid,
[2:34:34] full of uncertainty.
[2:34:39] When the plans that I
[2:34:41] [music and singing] made all fall apart
[2:34:47] when the future's unclear
[2:34:56] way,
[2:34:59] there [music] is a promise
[2:35:02] echoing in my heart
[2:35:06] [singing]
[2:35:07] that he [music] will be faithful to the
[2:35:11] end.
[2:35:13] He will provide [music]

[2:35:22] So faithful [music]
[2:35:23] to [singing] the end.
[2:35:30] When [music] all else is fad,

[2:35:38] He [music] will be faithful.
[2:35:42] So faithful to thee.
[2:35:47] [music and singing] There is grace I can

[2:38:12] pain.
[2:38:14] He will be faithful.
[2:38:17] faithful [music] to the end. [singing]
[2:38:25] Hallelujah.

[2:45:52] [cheering]
[2:45:52] Come on, somebody. And [screaming] it
[2:45:54] ain't hope. It's faith. And I'm
[2:45:57] steadfast in it. I'm going.
[2:46:02] [applause]
[2:46:03] [cheering]
[2:46:04] Hallelujah. [screaming]
[2:46:07] Hallelujah. [cheering]
[2:46:09] [applause]
[2:46:09] Hallelujah.
[2:46:12] This is the start of 2026
[2:46:15] [applause and cheering] and we are
[2:46:16] steadfast in the faith of God.
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:46:25] Christ. [cheering]
[2:46:28] &gt;&gt; Was it worth driving from West Virginia
[2:46:30] for? Brother Ron,
[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; was it worth driving from Mary and
[2:46:34] Virginia? Brothers,
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; was it worth driving from Groto and
[2:46:38] Harrisonburg?
[2:46:41] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:46:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Roy, was it worth climbing up
[2:46:43] the hill? [applause]
[2:46:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I got my name attached to
[2:46:50] the promise.
[2:46:53] [applause]
[2:46:54] Woo! [cheering]
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[2:47:08] [applause]
[2:47:09] &gt;&gt; There's a woman that sings a song. A
[2:47:11] Christian artist sings a song. There's a
[2:47:14] miracle in the room and it's got my name
[2:47:17] on it.
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; I ain't got near enough voice to sing
[2:47:22] that song. But I do know this. There's
[2:47:25] miracles in this room that's got my name
[2:47:29] on it. And there ain't no devil in hell
[2:47:35] &gt;&gt; going to take it away from you.
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; I feel so electrified right now by the
[2:47:43] presence of the Lord.
[2:47:46] Brother Paul and Sister Husani, there
[2:47:49] was a miracle in the room and it had
[2:47:52] your daughter's name all over it.
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; And wasn't age or no doctor or nothing
[2:47:57] going to keep it out of the room? And
[2:47:59] tomorrow morning, we're going to
[2:48:01] dedicate their little baby.
[2:48:05] [applause]
[2:48:07] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. There's a breakthrough
[2:48:10] in this room.
[2:48:12] Does it have your name on it?
[2:48:14] &gt;&gt; There's deliverance in this room. Does
[2:48:16] it have your name on it?
[2:48:20] &gt;&gt; I wish it was my turn to preach tonight
[2:48:23] instead of waiting till tomorrow. So,
[2:48:25] I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll let
[2:48:27] them go again if they want to.
[2:48:30] My goodness,
[2:48:32] &gt;&gt; what a time we've had down here. Full
[2:48:34] Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle.
[2:48:40] Woo! Hallelujah.
[2:48:44] Hallelujah.
[2:48:48] [applause]
[2:48:49] &gt;&gt; I'm younger than these guys, but boy, I
[2:48:53] sure couldn't be more proud of them.
[2:48:56] When I grow up,
[2:48:59] [laughter]
[2:49:00] when I grow up, Lord, let me be a
[2:49:03] preacher like him.
[2:49:07] Aren't you proud of the ministry that
[2:49:10] the Lord's given us here at Full Gospel
[2:49:11] White House? Give these brothers a great
[2:49:13] big hand tonight. [applause]
[2:49:20] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:49:21] &gt;&gt; I'm going to let y'all be dismissed cuz
[2:49:24] I got a shout on the inside of me that
[2:49:26] I'm afraid that if I let it loose, y'all
[2:49:27] might be here till midnight. So, I'm
[2:49:29] going to let y'all be dismissed cuz I I
[2:49:31] know that some of y'all y'all ain't got
[2:49:33] all that in you right now. So, I'm going
[2:49:35] to say, "God bless you." And y'all pray
[2:49:38] for the young boy tomorrow.
[2:49:41] And I'll come out the barn maybe just
[2:49:43] kicking a little bit, just a little bit.
[2:49:47] Maybe I'll get the door wide open so big
[2:49:50] daddy can come running right through it.
[2:49:54] [applause]
[2:49:55] Woo! Hallelujah.
[2:50:01] [applause]
[2:50:04] Look what the Lord's done.
[2:50:06] &gt;&gt; Look what the Lord has done. Amen. We're
[2:50:09] going to let you be dismissed tonight. I
[2:50:10] I know that you got the same heart that
[2:50:12] I do that you would love to rejoice all
[2:50:14] night. But we do realize that these
[2:50:16] bodies, they need rest and I need to
[2:50:19] prepare something after these guys. So
[2:50:23] maybe I'll do like brother Donnie and
[2:50:25] I'll dig over in the maps and find
[2:50:27] something. So God bless you tonight. We
[2:50:30] love you with the love of the Lord.
[2:50:31] Tomorrow morning services at 11:00 you
[2:50:33] be remembering us in the name of Jesus
[2:50:35] Christ. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
