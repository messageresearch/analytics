see each and every one of you this morning our visitors that are with us god bless you so grateful to have you with us and uh we thank you for being here amen our brother from brother joseph hummons is with us this morning amen i think you guys are from paul's is that right paula fontaine and amen god bless you thank you for being here amen what a wonderful time in the lord we had last night masterpiece an absolute masterpiece and for those that haven't heard it go listen to it it was absolutely awesome and so we thank the lord for that we know that no man can put all of that together god puts it together and he does real well with it amen we want to continue the thought this morning of what we had last week unlimited we serve as a reminder because sometimes we as human beings we look at we get so focused on this temporary flesh but we need to be reminded that we serve an unlimited god [Music] [Applause] we serve an unlimited god let's say it again we serve an unlimited god amen i want to talk to you about this morning first scripture luke chapter 1 and verse 37 and i want to remind you that this is these are the words given to mary by an angel amen not just any angel but the announcing angel gabriel himself said this about god hallelujah for with god nothing shall be impossible i want i want you to read this with me and i want you to put emphasis on it for with god nothing shall be impossible now i want you to speak to your impossibilities right here this morning because mountains aren't going to speak and rocks are not going to speak it takes a believer and the difference between you and the average bear is that you're a son and daughter of god and anybody can read the bible that has the ability to read but as believers we have position with god we have more authority than even gabriel had and gabriel is saying there's nothing impossible with god and he's speaking to a little virgin that's going to conceive and have a child never knowing a man but it's been prophecy for for hundreds of years but the the time is going to intercept with prophecy and it's going to come to pass you're the people of rapture are you with me you're the people of rapture and i want to read it one more time for with god nothing shall be impossible you may be seated this morning hebrews chapter 11 and verse 5 says it like this by faith this is our type of rapture because we're going to leave the earth and there's many of us that are not taste of death and they'll just reason away we've went away somewhere another but there's going to come a universal rapture around the world this message has went into every nation and this message has rapture inside of it [Music] we're just walking like enoch walked by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god i'm going to do something i'm not doing anything that's wrong here but i want i want you to read your name right here because this is your type and i want you to read your name i don't want to be vocal this morning you that's on the internet i want you to do it for by faith ron spencer was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god oh let's add church but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him [Applause] hallelujah brother brandon made this statement improving his words this is powerful short but it's powerful eternal life you always was see you have eternal life and there's only one form of it and that's god you were his attribute he thought of you and knowed you before the foundation of the world in his mind and he would use this quotation i came from god and i'm going back to god i say it this morning i came from god and i'm going back to god i love my mom and daddy but that listen god thought of me before my mom and daddy ever thought of me because i was an attribute of god before the foundation of the world the scripture says in hebrews chapter 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear brother brandon would tell us he said god spoke it and believed his own word in colossians chapter 1 and verse 15 who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth amen now we're preaching on an an uh unlimited god here for by him were all things created i don't care what science says that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him let's say that together all things were created by him and for him he is before all things and by him all things consist i'm in that all things consist [Applause] nothing happens by chance there's no accidents with a child of god the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord i feel like i'm standing in 10 000 watts of energy up here hallelujah all things and he is before all things and by him all things consist he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you now notice god brings you right into this and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked's work yet now have he reconciled hallelujah hallelujah god knew where what a wretched vow that we would be coming into this sin cursed earth in this body but god that was rich in mercy through his life he saved us [Music] glory he didn't leave us in that nasty condition but he raised us up [Applause] didn't patch us up he raised us up and we became a new creation not the old man made over anew but he made us a new creation you couldn't do that to yourself this is more than psychology this is more than making a vow and then trying to live it this is more than turning over a new leaf god you he gives you a new spirit so that he can live with you [Applause] aren't you glad of that brother man said now he gives you a new spirit so god can live with you then he gives you his holy spirits and the holy spirit is your god and your leader that'll watch over your life and nothing happens in your life that he takes by chance he's watching over your lives [Applause] in the body of his flesh food that through death to present you holy unblameable unreprovable in his sight that's enough to shout when god looks down at you well brother ron i can't see myself perfect it's not it's not so important to how you see yourself it's important how god sees you brother ron but i've got a long story i've got a i've got a mess i can't untangle the webs in my life don't you worry god knows how to untie knots he knows how to untie your life he knows where you're at you're in trouble god knows how to fix [Applause] thank it lord in luke chapter 1 and verse 30 and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou has found favorable with god now i want to say this to you because it just really came to me this week and just really dropped in my heart i had a hard time holding it from you guys but i had a hard time when i came across this scripture i've read it thousands of times but this angel is on dispatch from god that knows no time space or eternity this this angel is not affected by circumstances of this world politics he's not he's not affected by anything of this world all he knows is there's a word that has been dropped to a prophet isaiah and it has circled the earth for hundreds of years and now that girl has came to her season in her life and time has intercepted with prophecy and this angel that cannot lie he is a representative of god is standing there and he's telling mary thou has found favor with god i want to tell you mary's not the only one i'm talking to this morning brother roger you found favor with god it's not what your neighbors think about you it's not what the community thinks about you but you found favor with god [Applause] amen and behold thou hast shall rec conceive in thy womb and shall bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever listen the angel is telling her the potential of the seed that is being placed in her womb you have heard the angel in this dispensation stand night after night and explain to you the potential of this message you will reign as the queen of heaven [Applause] you will live in the city in the seventh step of the city you are the people of the open book the bible had been closed by denominational creeds for 2 000 years but god opened the bible to you as the bride of jesus christ [Applause] [Music] and you're the people of rapture that can walk alive so pleasing to god that god can justify himself to take you off of the earth that you will not see a tribulation hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the angel answered her and said unto the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee and therefore also that holy thing we shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god for that portion of that scripture will be the reason that he will be crucified not because he healed their sick not because he raised their dead but when he said i and my father won they took up stones to stone him not the disciples but when jesus called himself god and identified him as the messiah that i'm here [Music] the religious people with their denominations wanting to crucify him now notice he has not only got mary in his mind but miles away there's a woman named elizabeth god's always concerned about you never come to the spot that you think god's forgot you and behold thy cousin elizabeth she has also conceived a son and in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren amen unlimited god unlimited god god doesn't change elizabeth back to a young woman like he did sarah but he took an old woman that was barren [Music] and gave her a son that was now dead in the womb and and and mary said behold the handmaid notice now full with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me brother ron i just don't know what to say sometimes in a service listen this is a good response be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her i had a reason to say it like i just said it because sometimes brother jeremy do you have that picture that i sent to you last week do you still have that available let's see more said all right if i just go ahead and crush the devil for a little while for those that don't know this is about 12 years ago 13 years ago now 14 years ago word as time go i've been here 21 years hallelujah i'm celebrating the anniversary where did that go but i am an icu at uva i've been burned my lungs have been burned of course my skin had been burned my arms had been burned they would reconstruct my arms all the skin on my hands was burned off everything that you see was burnt off my face was burned uh my throat was burned my tongue was burned my lips were burned uh it burned down in my lungs dr uh kramer actually that's that was at rmh said when i scoped your lungs he said all i saw was charred lungs now i'm going for a scan tomorrow and so i'm i'm i'm i'm killing devils while i'm getting ready now you know we get requests here that are sometimes horrendous and and sometimes the doctor tells you you've got cancer turns out that you don't but you you when you hear the word cancer just sends a chill through you that's right it sends your life right before you and and and i pray for those needs very very strongly because i know what the dread is you know and then you get news good news in a few days and you're just so relieved but but it was christmas a year and a half ago that i i got news i thought i had a prostate infection didn't tell you that but i thought i had a prostate infection something wrong there and i had been suffering for for a couple of months with that i had some situations that was going on and and then i got the news that dr uh buckwalter would give me the news he said i'm sending you down a dark road i didn't know what that dark road was but i've been in some dark roads i've been in some dark roads i just talked to brother tim pruitt on the way here to the service and sister karen is is now responding she's saying a few words she's aware that you're in the room she kind of knows who everybody is and brother tim reminded i i just reminded brother tim i i just kind of conversed with him about what i was speaking this morning and he said brother ron you were worse than what sister karen was i was in a i was in a non-responsive place and the doctors would even say brain dead then they would would tell they would begin to tell us later that i was just hours away from them requesting that even i would take my my organs five hours actually with the term that they used and so and so brother tim had had came to this meeting to to come to see me and many ministers that came to pray for me and lay their hands on me and pray for me you had prayed and brother tim comes dispatched by by god himself to come and come and speak to to see me in the hospital and and he said he just told me the other day he said what i walked in was worse than i could have ever imagined he said but i knew i had a word in my heart to preach in that state i wasn't able to speak with him and and so you know i i brother tim and brother homer would host brother tim and and so anyway brother tim would walk to the pulpit and i want to remind you here no service is not important no service is not important it is just as important and and i i may shock you right now but it's just as important as gabriel giving instructions to mary are you with me now let me just say this you so many times people come to a service and there'll be parts of it that they go well i really enjoyed that part and then another part they'll sort it out and just kind of throw that away and they've actually missed what god is saying to them and if you pay careful instructions no you don't need brother branham to call you out tell you your name and your address you know that many of you don't need to know the diseases that are in your body many of you already know that but the god that is in control of our lives [Applause] walks to the pulpit in the form of a vessel and he begins to speak the words of life and then you grab a hold of it and you begin to believe it with all your hearts those words have power [Applause] i'm speaking about an unlimited god don't you shut down on me now it ain't a good time sister kaniwa would leave the hospital actually late to come to the service and i fell into that non-responsive state it was just gone i want to give you my part of it and i was laying there and i watched connie go out of the room she'd come back in later and i remember i remember just seeing light a light and i remember seeing a tunnel and i felt my life leaving my body and these are the thoughts that i thought this must be what it's like to die and it was like a light switch went off now in the medicated coma when you walked into the room i knew who was there much of the time and could hear words and even brother biscuit will instruct sister connie make sure that you speak positive to brother ron and even brother homer would say that as well make sure you speak positive things because they say the hearing is the last to go and that's true it's very true but as i slipped away sister connie knowing that you know i hear people talk about excuses of missing church and she left me knowing i was non-responsive because this word is more important than the temporary that she saw this church is without excuse imagine what her heart was doing after a month and now he's he's non-responsive she gets in the car and she makes a journey across it this mountain right here she comes in and she sits down behind sister joyce and sister evelyn and they ask how is he and she said he's bad but that didn't stop her from the word are you with me now i know i've caught you some of you by your breath but i mean too my brother my buddy brother tim pruitt is standing in the pulpit in just a few moments and his wife is in the condition that she's in and he is faithful at his post of duty [Applause] how stupid satan must be and i'm doing this with purpose this [Applause] morning this thing told me that just moments literally seconds before i walked out that i was getting ready to drop into a danger zone of sugar i drank a coca-cola standing right there i'm not scared of the devil [Applause] are you with me i'm not apologetic to have coca-cola sitting on my my my my pulpit this morning cause i've got a word to preach and satan wants to fight against it he's defeated brother tim pruitt that is getting ready to preach this morning in louisiana at his church walk through this pulpit and he begins to preach and he preaches two sermons now it's more what i have laying in front of me is more important to me than even a recording my wife said in this meeting and as she does in every service she was beginning to write notes the title of his sermon is god will have a testimony i want to remind you sister karen god will have a testimony i didn't ask connie for permission of this but it's too late anyway these are her notes and i'm going to read them verbatim our daily walk with god trials satan can't destroy us until god gives him permission now remember i'm standing here 14 years later after being brain dead god is in control there is a reason for everything the lord delivers them out of them all right satan is only a tool in the hand of gods in god's hand real christians with heart disease and cancer real christians brother i thought i wasn't i wasn't supposed to have trouble after becoming a christian you just joined an army and we are at war families with financial problems the lord says that you're going to have tribulations the word says you're going to have tribulations they're given to you for a reason then you ask the question where was god at it produces spiritual growth we cannot understand god's grace we can under not understand that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered satan i hope you're listening god gives us footsteps through our cross and he makes a promise that i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world you're not alone you're not even having the energy to carry yourself it's god that's got you through this they're given to you for a reason we are here for a reason calvary works the overcomer that comes through screams i shall come forth as gold i know my redeemer liveth right job god will provide a sacrifice this is our testing time amen the just shall live by faith they come to the hospital after that service and that day i would lay non-responsive through the whole day the doctors were apologetic they didn't know what had happened they didn't know what was going on you guys took pictures with me my brother came took pictures that's the reason we've got these today my brothers came and got pictures with me and these were the most presentable that i could get for you because some people don't handle these kind of things well i want to say this to you just now brother tim didn't come to the next service with an apology he didn't come to the service to you as an audience and tell you how bad it was he didn't come and say well you're going to lose your pastor it's how how horrible he must have sinned no he came and preached on god's hall of fame you ready for the notes from that one overcoming power for now i love these i i just sister can i'm gonna preach a series on these meetings one of these dates the gates of hell cannot prevail against me amen remember where she's sitting at and she's hearing a word that is telling her there's nothing impossible with god i'm not just preaching it for for 12 years ago or 14 years ago god knows your circumstance right now i want to remind you god's greater than cancer god's greater than covet god's greater than any situation in your life he's greater than death he's grander i want to say he's greater [Music] hallelujah he's greater i'm one out of a million that's right one out of million that god predestinated he predestinated me i like that she wrote that i like that he predestinated me that means if he foresaw me before the foundation world he watched over my seat all the way to this hour and it came through homer and nancy's through their womb happy birthday sister nancy god bless you queen of this church god bless you god knew what he was doing when homer got out of a car with a dare and said i'm gonna kiss that girl right there in the church yard i'm gonna kiss that girl and he chased her around the building and he grabbed her and kissed her he said i laid a kiss on her she'd never forget god bless you brother homer god watched over that seed and through that womb came thomas and denise and sister connie that would be my queen you talking about predestination god watched over you and if he watched over you when you had no choice how much more can he watch over you now [Applause] i keep faith working for those things that will appear um hallelujah brother branham had a sword in his hand it was not just a sword it was the sword the king sword it was a third pull that third pool produced squirrels it spoke a storm out of existence it spoke to sister moody's womb across america and a doctor and brother bam said exactly what the word said as the doctor puts his hands on her may that tumor leaf the opening of the word was a part of that this word that is producing a bride for jesus christ somebody asked me some one time said how do you believe that brother branham had a sword in his hand i said i believe him just as much as i believe mary when she met an angel of the lord i said further than that i have a personal testimony that i've experienced a living god in my life i want to remind you i once was a lot of bad things but god that was rich in mercy took a caterpillar that was crawling on the ground and put it in a cocoon and gave me the holy ghost and now i fly like a butterfly sting like a bee [Applause] the word is in your hands and that word became a mystery of the seven seals and they were revealed it is hundred percent accurate amen faith rises the third pull with hattie wright and she said that's absolutely the truth brother branham i wonder if you're sitting in the meeting today and looking at your circumstances and hearing the word of the lord as it's preached under the anointing and you that's absolutely the truth tract try it you're a believer speak to your mountain [Applause] you serve an unlimited god quit looking in the mirror and your feelings and your situations of your life speak the word of god to your horrible situation it doesn't matter how long it takes god's god's not necessarily in a hurry sometimes but abraham kept confessing forgive me you speak it if words move like a thought you say whatever you you whatever you say speak it let it be god and the power of his words remember i'm a serpent bruiser i want you to say that out loud i'm a serpent bruiser did 40 of this audience say that i'm a serpent bruiser as we walk with god we can face our storms and reflect the morning star and have songs of victory not of this world that's right amen they leave that service you heard those notes and i stayed like that until somewhere around seven o'clock the next morning but there was a man that can turn on the lights brother tim pruitt said it at cracker barrel and prayed with sister karen and sister karen they they prayed before they left it was their leaving day said i want to speak to brother ron i want to hear his voice and so when they were able to get in the burn unit they're walking down the hall and as they're walking down the hall they hear my voice and sister connie said that was one of the greatest moments in her life when she heard my voice come on church god knows how to raise the dead brother on do you believe you were the worst case no sir because jesus had a friend [Applause] they've done buried him they've done put the stuff on him they had wrapped him up they had called for jesus to come and jesus didn't come but jesus is always on time he was fellowshipping in another realm with believers and he heard a voice call back to him because jesus was the master of death hell and the grave and jesus called lazarus by name you talking about an unlimited god let me remind you here brother brethren said if god jesus had not called him by name there would have been a general resurrection [Applause] hallelujah i want to remind you one of these mornings that resurrection voice is going to call our loved ones out of the grave they're going to step from that room to this room hallelujah in the moment in the twinkling of an eye my mom put a hammer name your loved ones they're going to step from that dimension to this dimension because the word that they went down believing it's still effective [Applause] it wasn't just effective for brother homer to preach it here but it's still effective for him right now it's still in effect somewhere he's dancing he's getting ready to cross over there's a gathering happening [Applause] he's an unlimited god he's an unlimited god god washed this earth and science had proved that there was no rain in the sky it didn't stop god brother brown makes a statement i want to just drop to you in the face of all of this doubt god does go right on proving his words to be right as he has in every age unbelief does not stop god it doesn't hinder him i don't care how much the world unbelieves it's still going to happen [Applause] [Music] unbelief does it do nothing but condemn the unbeliever the unbelief will send the unbeliever to hell so why would you pay attention to anything your critics got to say amen did you see what so-and-so said on facebook i could care less [Music] i could care less do you see what they they said about you brother i could kill this their words is going to condemn them in hell you can put out a video about me it'll only condemn you it ain't gonna hurt me none i know where i'm standing unbelief doesn't do nothing but condemns the unbeliever amen the unbelief will send the unbeliever to hell i want to caution you right here in this media society be careful what you check off you like i like i lack i like i lack i like be careful what you check off i don't like a budweiser on a grave site first of all where he where he's at he'd like to have a drink of it so don't go check it off i like it don't go check off well this person's in a bar room and they're having a time don't check off i like that don't check it off hey i'm preaching to you now i don't want to be condemned one of these days for i like the wrong things i know it'll make some of you mad but i'm i am your last source of help [Applause] i'm your last source of help and if you turn me off you're in trouble [Applause] [Music] amen cowards get behind a computer [Applause] [Music] and send out anonymous nonsense because they know if they attack me in person they could get exposed for their adultery [Applause] someone sent me some nonsense here a few weeks ago and god revealed to me this is an adulterer that's having an affair on their on their mate what if they'd like for me to send that back to them that god just revealed to me that you're having adultery on your way how would your friends like that [Applause] come on i know where i'm at i know where i'm standing i ain't a chicken [Applause] i don't live through all of that cancer are you with me now you take it down now the unbelief will send the sinner to hell it'll rob him of the every blessing god promised to him but it doesn't hinder god from going right on with the believer unbelief doesn't stop god it only stops the unbeliever i wrote this testimony before i walked out and took this service as i stand here and declare this infallible word the cells of cancer threatens my existence but i want to remind satan whose report we believe cancer is defeated in the name of jesus christ i have a quote to go with that brother braham says improve in his word he said he will take the life out of the cancer [Applause] he will do anything he has got you stand by him he will stand by you you stand by him that's what i'm doing here this morning [Applause] he will stand by you he proves his word true every time he took the heat out of the blaze three hebrews children he stopped the mouths the lion's mouth that's right daniel in the lines then the scripture says in romans chapter 8 and verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry about father the spirit itself therefore beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god brother i don't know if i'm a christian when we're where where where is your desire at your desires to be in church that ought to tell you who you are your love is toward church and this is the most important part of your week that ought to tell you where you are i have no question where i'll be on rapture morning because where i'm sitting here today gets me in position to be there on rapture morning oh somebody wind that clock back let's have church [Applause] and if children then heirs and heirs of god and join heirs with christ if you are an heir he owns it all he is unlimited than the unlimited power of god he has placed on the inside of you and you take him at his word and you take faith and believe it and speak [Applause] [Music] oh glory he's infinite he's omnipotent he's got he's omnipotent he's on the present he's on mission he knows all things all wisdom all time covers all space and all power he's evident and if he isn't god then if he isn't if he isn't all of that he's not god he can't do all things he's not almighty god but he is almighty god he can do all things so that's the way we have to believe him [Music] it was several years ago i was here and i took sister connie's notes and i shared them with you this morning now i'm going to share another deal someone called me back when that believed the sign nonsense happened and they called me and they they were telling me that brother branham did not pray for king george and they were very abusive toward me and very non-congenial if that's the word non-diplomatic you know very abusive you know it's just like the rain in the sky noah preached it because god said so you can argue about 16 people on a bridge we just take a prophet at his word sword in the hand we take a prophet at his word brother brady who was here with us preaching and he had preached every year to that point and a couple years after that brother brady was here i did not dare say a word to brother and sister brady about what i had went through that week and and it was a couple of different calls that had came and what was going on and so brother brady had started his service and he was preaching and he i was sitting where andrew was sitting and brother brady was very he was very preaching and all of a sudden he said and you're a witness of this he just stopped he said let me just answer a question here and he said back when we were working in a house as a servants sister brady and myself we were working for the queen mother and we were working for how many to remember this now and he and he said can you expand the audience just now just raise your hand how many were here and hear this and brother brady was just he was just saying he said we were working in the house and we'd get them up at a certain time and he began to describe some of the things that they did for the people that worked there that was there they actually worked the kitchen they worked this service they they they took care of them they had to dress a certain way as a servant and they would take care of them go in and ring a little bell to wake them up and to help them get dressed and all these things sister brady was dressing the queen mother and it was the day before they were to leave and go into the full-time ministry the queen mother asked her said why are why are you leaving why why are you leaving the house don't we treat you good and just went through a lot of things and that's not important now but remember sister brady was the one with the bad feet and she sends a letter you can imagine it wasn't an email but she sent a letter to brother brady in north carolina and he got the letter and it was to have have a minister pray for her feet because they were swell so bad you couldn't walk then imagine being a serpent and having that condition and brother brady is here and they take him to brother branham's meeting and he said and in two services and on the second service brother brandon was preaching what is the attraction on the mountain and if you remember he was talking about prophecy becoming history and they were telling brother brady that this is elijah this is the fulfillment of malachi 4 5 and 6 and these things were new brother brady says these words he said from the first time i heard brother branham speak i knew he was a prophet to this generation it don't take two years six months it don't take the convention the seed in you [Applause] hallelujah you're watching by the way of the internet and you're battling this message you're battling this message it ought to tell you you need a conversion you need a real conversion you need christ in your life scream for mercy you've done bad things against this message scream for mercy while there's still time left god don't send you to hell you send yourself to hell god makes a way of resting for you run to the ark of safety while there's time run run run run [Applause] matter of fact i'm one of the best friends you can ever have in your life i'll fight for you when you give up brother brady's repeats what the queen mother she said remember forgive me a lot of things are running in my mind my mind's going a million miles an hour i grew up with a man named charlie mitchell and i only want to bring this here to to give a testimony of two witness charlie mitchell had a tumor in his left lung it was cancer he was gonna kill him brother fulcher who was my dad's pastor at that time took him charlie that was dying the doctors couldn't do anything with him but he took him to the meeting they couldn't sit in the front but charlie was sitting in the back and you can hear brother branham call out to him i listened to charlie many years of my childhood listen to him tell the testimony sister suzanne i'm sure you heard it too charlie said it was like an eye and he said i actually ducked my head he said it was an eye and he said i knew i couldn't it wasn't brother branham i could see an eye and it was looking and in just a moment he said mr mitchell he calls him by name right you got a tumor on your left lung knew that brother brady is sitting there with the letter in his pocket right amen brother brady does the same thing he said there was an eye they came looking and he said i got my head i never seen nothing like this remember brother brady had been in a meeting where brother branham had walked out of the back door on the pulpit and he walks across that's all right i'm going to go just a little over time but i feel like this is going to be all right and brother branham walks out of the office and when he walks out on the pulpit he turns his back and starts calling out people in the audience to be to be exactly called out 14 people in the audience and told them multiple things about them that was going wrong more than a man was there more than a man was there this is more than william branham's message hallelujah if you were in noah's day noah would meet you at the door for the haters of brother branham to get in a rapture you're going to have to meet brother branham at the door [Applause] i'm not apologizing for that statement you'll have to meet the messenger at the door [Applause] oh brother ron but you guys follow a man who are you following [Applause] we don't worship the man but we worship the god that lived inside of that man and we saw so much god until people confused him as god [Applause] but may that be your testimony that you live a life so pleasing to god until people confuse [Applause] you i feel good mr brady i see you come across water you're from jamaica it's about your wife brother brady said i started checking my pocket the letter was still there i hadn't shared it with nobody and now he knew god knew his name he knew where he was from he knew his wife was in condition listen he didn't need nobody else to convince him that this message was right [Applause] [Music] i don't need nobody to convince me this message is right brother kenny we've seen enough of god we've seen enough of god if he never does nothing else for us we've seen enough of god to say that's absolutely correct brother branham be it unto me according to thy word i believe what the angel is said unto me i'm going to speak it and i'm going to believe it listen folks i'm here to tell you i believe this message so much i believe that if it raised me from a brain-dead condition they told me i never walked again when i broke my back from every vertebrae all the way into my neck still still scars are there let me just say when they said i'll never walk again i simply responded to the doctor that night you don't know who you're talking to [Applause] hallelujah now sister brady had that experience more than a message but she had an experience with her feet she's standing on the feet that god healed and so she mentions to the mother of the queen we believe a message of william marion branham amen and the queen responds i met him amen i met him he came and prayed for king george for your information she told exactly how that they brought him in said they swept him in secretly by night i said king george wasn't the only miracle he touched me when i stepped by brother brady and sister brady watch every service that i preach they know it's the truth amen god bless you brother tom god bless you by the way brother tom he'll heal you that condition he's greater than their condition i was sitting in the meeting and god was so mindful of the situation he would let brother brady tell the story i stood for god only days before and so god confirmed it in this pulpit and by the way king george played golf the next day amen can you give me about five more minutes i'm going to have some people stand up here in just a moment i want to preface this with something now i'm just who i am and god built me the way he is i'm not a good preacher and i heard someone say here lately that said when you're not a good preacher god has to give you gifts well i'm okay with that too so let me explain to you brother tim pruitt is a great dreamer god gives him dreams and he will only have one on occasion but he knows it's from the lord mother donny's brother donnie reagan is a phenomenal preacher and we all love his gift we'll have him here in a few days i hope you're praying about those meetings and it just seems like that when brother donnie speaks it's like it's like you're an hour hour and 20 minutes just goes and we enjoy his gift we enjoy the gifts that are in the body we enjoy the jason jacksons we enjoy that that thunderbolt preaching that gripping i enjoy the tom ray the passion of the word i enjoy the danny steam i could call it for quite a long time i look past the man and see god [Applause] [Music] are you with me we enjoy we enjoy the ministry the fifo ministry and listen god called preachers to preach not to play tapes to call them to preach one morning because god has gifted me the way that he's gifted me you know we we have evidence of it in the hundreds of times now and so i i'm not guessing at it i go by the atmosphere that's with it but i dreamed a dream and i dreamed that we were a couple things would happen and i'm going to go over time now so you just you just hang right with me there was two parts of the dream that we were together brother temperant brother donnie reagan myself and brother ed biskell was going to be in the same meeting and we would be standing getting our pictures together and saying this is a vision become real well brother donny and brother tim and myself and brother bischo was scheduled to be in switzerland that year but satan when he sees these things happen he tries to block the visitation now i'm going to preach here and this is an important part he tries to block because the word he can't stop but if you can get your eyes on the circumstances he can block he tried to do that with sarah and abraham and so and so brother bisco could not make the meeting only and there and they watch only in the last couple of weeks did he make the decision i'll go he didn't hardly have enough strength to be in the meeting but he came to the meeting at the end of it we're all standing there and we're standing before this great big window and we're all standing locked arm and arm we got the picture somewhere because the vision had to be fulfilled the second part of that that that dream vision whatever you want to call it there that dream i see a a pretty large gathering and brother timothy pruitt is is standing and he is speaking he is speaking that i am the resurrection and the life well well this god's doing some things this morning would you just would you just enjoy it just a few minutes and he's preaching i am the resurrection and the life and brother tim will come to the pulpit a little bit later and i'm sitting just just to in the audience setting just right there and he begins to talk about he said brother ron is here and he begins to say he's my friend and i'm not going to great detail but he's my friend and brother temp brother tim out of his lips in this dream he says these words all thou suffering stand and be healed i can get the dates i don't have them but davies probably can give them to me the next morning that morning davey was in a truck wreck brother david will you stand just now if you could just put it you got him but the david was in a truck wreck on on black ice and he flipped that truck and it literally wrapped a tree and it was just about an inch away from it crushing his head but it crushed his it crushed his shoulder it crushed his vertebrae it crushed his hips crushed his knee i was standing there when the doctors told him he would never have children because he was so crushed you remember brother homer was crushed in his pelvis davey was completely crushed and it was come together on his organs we serve an unlimited god you remember a year a year a little over a year before that there was a barren womb and now satan was taking another jab at a man that was in a vision that was going to have a baby you're talking about unlimited when you come to impossibilities god knows what's in your future you remember the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord while that truck was flipping don't you know the angels of god were on this back let me crush but don't take his life my mother had a heart attack she thought it was a bad fish sandwich us old-timers we blame everything on what we ate and my mother would have a heart attack that would continue going and my mother was laying in the hospital and i came and preached that on saturday night when i get done preaching i we drop sister nancy off which is what we what we do we drop sister nancy off and then we go home she don't want to go home with me so we drop her off we drop her off and we say our goodbyes and and many times sister connie helps her through the door and makes sure everything's okay and while i'm sitting in the car the lord speaks to me get to your mother's side this is very dear to our hearts now when connie gets back in the car i said i've got to be at mom i got to be at mom's in the morning so i called andrew and andrew andrew told me he said well you know dad i because god didn't speak to him he spoke to me and he said well you know i got a lot to do in the morning and he just said it like that you know a lot of times that's what we do we don't understand the situation you see i saw i saw this morning while i was on a treadmill i was preaching in this suit and this yellow this gold tie don't you know when i went to my closet i went and pulled it out when you say well that's just that's just nonsense brother ron well you see before i walked out of here when my sugar was dropping out the bottom i knew satan was trying to stop what's getting ready to come forth [Music] and he's no match for my god [Applause] and on my way i have a conversation with brother tim and brother tim pruitt says brother ron your dream is getting ready to be fulfilled brother david i've never told you this but he said god's going to raise davey up and you were in horrible shape he's going to raise davey up but he's going to raise your mother and give her a new body don't you know that was very difficult to hear that's right amen but that's the greatest miracle that my god could do for my mom is to raise her up and as i walked in and andrew and i walked in and we're we're standing there and the doctors have already practiced that she's getting ready to go she's you know she's giving us our last wishes and i walk in and i have a conversation with mom she's as clear and steady as i am right now and when and when and when she spoke to us and how much she loved us and those things am i telling the truth those things then the doctor came and told me the situation he walks over and tells talks to mom and he talks to her very quietly he has an incredible bedside manner and he begins to tell her the situation she said i'm ready to go and in that second the light the light switch went gone hollywood can't write it like that well you don't understand death is a christian's friend death is a christian's friend because my last breath here is my first breath there you don't think the devil whispered in my ears for three years sister hannah i want you to listen to this real real clear right now because i'm on a mission you don't think that he whispered in my ears for three years it ain't happening you're just a man you missed it it ain't up to me it ain't up to me i can't produce it myself but god had to restore his body and he had to restore her wound come on church brother ron i've been waiting on a miracle for a long time don't get in a hurry with god i've stood in this pulpit now over a year after they told me i was going to die they came in the hospital and sat on my bed and said you got about four months to live or you have any wishes you have any things wonderful doctors dr fadul that actually spoke to me the other day he was one of the doctors that would give me a grim report don't tell me listen when satan sent his enemy against me he didn't send just some novice but i want you to know we had met him with the word of god we stood in this pulpit and tried to encourage cancer patients around the world i wore this bow in this pulpit proud so that cancer patients that are listening around the world there's hope there's hope i don't care what the doctors are saying there's hope there's strength we have a promise hallelujah i want to say this to you this could get to sister karen now sister karen you're the greater esther that god was talking about he told us a few weeks prior to sister karen's situation he told me three weeks woke me up in the middle of the night storm is coming a storm is coming the storm is coming listen if god knew a storm is coming he told us he's going to be with us god's not surprised by crisis are you with me now and so for the critic of brother tim pruitt the critic of brother donnie reagan the critic of all you preachers i want to remind that devil tonight they're defeated in the name of jesus christ put your camera right there on isaac right now that's a miracle that's a miracle that's a vision fulfilled are you with me god's unlimited and i'm talking about an unlimited god now i've run out of time i want to say this to you the same god that put hair back on the head of a little girl in

moriah don't you never let the devil whisper in your ears you're going to lose it again because the god that put your hair back on there is the god that can keep it there [Applause] whatever don't you wrestle in the night because of that that that devil whispered in your ear you take faith sister elena that has a testimony that god restored her lungs when cancer was trying to destroy her body and she ran around the building that day listen she had a death blow on her but she began to rejoice when they were singing on leaning on the everlasting arms that's what i'm leaning on tonight i don't
