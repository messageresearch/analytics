[1:01:03] almost there there but there's more work
[1:01:06] to
[1:01:06] do I thought that was so
[1:01:13] phenomenal I think it was Spurgeon said
[1:01:15] this courage is not having the strength
[1:01:19] to go
[1:01:21] on it is going on when you don't have
[1:01:25] the strength
[1:01:26] amen I remember and I'll just share this
[1:01:29] with
[1:01:30] you I remember when they were pulling me
[1:01:33] off of a ventilator after i' been there
[1:01:35] 3 weeks from the
[1:01:36] burning and so my lungs were burnt and
[1:01:39] my face was burnt my arms were burnt I'd
[1:01:42] been on a ventilator for 3 weeks and it
[1:01:45] was doing the burning it was doing the
[1:01:47] breathing for me and they were pulling
[1:01:50] me off and they say that's the time to
[1:01:52] when it's the most biggest struggle and
[1:01:55] they were pulling me off of the
[1:01:56] ventilator and your body has to begin to
[1:01:59] take over again because it gets attached
[1:02:01] to that ventilator and they were pulling
[1:02:03] me off of the
[1:02:06] ventilator and there was a lady named
[1:02:09] Debbie and her name sticks out to me
[1:02:12] because this this stuck with me and she
[1:02:15] began to scream in my ear fight for life
[1:02:19] amen Fight For Life fight for life and
[1:02:24] that's always stuck with me you got to
[1:02:27] fight for
[1:02:29] life I have fought a good
[1:02:32] fight I have finished my course I have
[1:02:36] kept the faith henceforth there is laid
[1:02:40] up for me a crown of righteousness which
[1:02:42] the Lord the righteous judge shall give
[1:02:44] me at that day and not to me only but
[1:02:49] unto all of
[1:02:51] them right unto all of them that love
[1:02:56] his
[1:02:57] appearing in Philippians chapter 3 and
[1:03:00] verse
[1:03:02] 13
[1:03:03] Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:03:07] apprehended but this one thing that I do
[1:03:11] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:03:14] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:03:16] which are before notice these next words
[1:03:19] I press towards the mark of the for the
[1:03:22] prize of the High Calling of God in
[1:03:25] Christ Jes
[1:03:28] Jesus you got to fight for
[1:03:31] it in Isaiah chapter 40 and verse
[1:03:35] 29 he giveth power to the
[1:03:39] faint and into them that have no might
[1:03:43] he increases
[1:03:45] strength even the youth shall faint and
[1:03:49] be weary and young men shall utterly F
[1:03:52] fall but they that wait upon the Lord
[1:03:56] shall renew their
[1:03:58] strength they shall Mount up with wings
[1:04:00] as eagles they shall run and not be
[1:04:03] weary they shall walk and not faint
[1:04:08] could we read that verse together
[1:04:10] today but they that wait upon the Lord
[1:04:14] shall renew their strength they shall
[1:04:17] Mount up with wings as eagles they shall
[1:04:20] run and not be weary they shall walk and
[1:04:24] not faint my favorite scripture Isaiah
[1:04:27] chter 54 and verse verse
[1:04:31] 16 behold I have created the Smith that
[1:04:34] bloweth the coals in the fire and that
[1:04:37] bringeth forth an instrument for the
[1:04:39] work and I have created the waser to
[1:04:43] destroy next scripture No
[1:04:46] Weapon no weapon that is formed against
[1:04:50] thee shall prosper and every tongue that
[1:04:53] shall rise against thee in the judge
[1:04:56] shal thou con condemn this is the
[1:05:00] heritage of the Servants of the Lord and
[1:05:03] their righteousness is of me saith the
[1:05:06] Lord amen I have three small quotes that
[1:05:10] I want to share with you I'm so glad
[1:05:14] that a man can so completely serve god
[1:05:17] Till the devil don't know what to do
[1:05:19] with
[1:05:21] him I want to be that man amen right
[1:05:25] brother Abram said the devil hates
[1:05:28] me and I know he hates you
[1:05:32] too and he's my
[1:05:34] enemy but as long as God is my friend I
[1:05:39] don't have no fear of
[1:05:41] him can I read it again for you the
[1:05:44] devil hates
[1:05:45] me and I know he hates you
[1:05:49] too and he's my enemy I love this next
[1:05:54] sentence but as long as God's my friend
[1:05:57] I have no fear of him
[1:05:59] right this he this is another quote have
[1:06:03] faith in God oh my how the devil has to
[1:06:07] recognize the supreme authority of Jesus
[1:06:10] Christ not
[1:06:12] me he hates me he don't have to mind me
[1:06:17] but he has to mind who I
[1:06:20] represent he has to mind who sent me
[1:06:23] here on
[1:06:27] that's not just for brother brandom and
[1:06:28] it's not just for me it's for you
[1:06:30] too Psalm chapter 23 is very familiar
[1:06:34] the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not
[1:06:42] want he maketh me to lie down in Green
[1:06:45] Pastures and he leadth me beside of the
[1:06:47] Still Waters he restoreth my soul he
[1:06:51] leadth me in the path of righteousness
[1:06:53] for his name's sake and yet though I
[1:06:56] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:06:58] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[1:07:01] with me thy rod and thy staff they
[1:07:03] comfort me thou preparest a table before
[1:07:06] me in the presence of my enemies thou
[1:07:09] anointest my head with all and my cup
[1:07:11] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[1:07:15] shall follow me all the days of my life
[1:07:18] and I will dwell in the house of the
[1:07:20] Lord forever
[1:07:26] Revelations 12 and verse 7 if you'll
[1:07:28] turn there with me they'll have it on
[1:07:30] the board and there was war in heaven oh
[1:07:35] and Michael and his angels fought
[1:07:37] against the
[1:07:39] dragon and the dragon fought against the
[1:07:43] angels and Prevail not amen neither was
[1:07:47] their place
[1:07:48] found anymore in
[1:07:51] heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out
[1:07:55] that old serpent called the devil and
[1:07:58] Satan which deceiveth the whole world he
[1:08:02] was cast out into the Earth and his
[1:08:06] angels were cast out with him I want you
[1:08:09] to understand
[1:08:11] tonight I want you to understand this
[1:08:14] the angels that fight for us has fought
[1:08:18] before
[1:08:21] right and they whipped the devil
[1:08:26] on so the devil that you fight has been
[1:08:30] whipped by the angels that are taking
[1:08:33] care of
[1:08:39] you
[1:08:42] Bo
[1:08:45] buil and I heard a loud voice in heaven
[1:08:47] saying now has come salvation and
[1:08:50] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[1:08:53] the power of His Saints for the accuser
[1:08:57] of our Brethren is cast down which
[1:09:01] accuse them before our God day and night
[1:09:07] am I want you to read this next verse
[1:09:10] with me and they overcame him by the
[1:09:14] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[1:09:17] their testimony and they love not their
[1:09:20] lives unto
[1:09:23] death every one of us have a
[1:09:27] story am I preaching to the
[1:09:30] radio every one of us have a
[1:09:34] story every one of us have a battle
[1:09:37] brother random said when you became a
[1:09:39] Christian you entered a battle right
[1:09:43] that's right but let me just know we
[1:09:45] know what what side that we are on
[1:09:50] Amen when you're in a battle there's
[1:09:52] flags that are raised that's right to
[1:09:55] let the enemy know who we represent come
[1:10:00] if we could raise that Christian flag
[1:10:02] and the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:10:05] want the devil to know that's right I am
[1:10:09] not on his
[1:10:12] side and he is defeated and I am here to
[1:10:17] represent who defeated
[1:10:22] him now a contest is a test of
[1:10:27] strength where we have a test of
[1:10:31] strength now I find it very
[1:10:35] interesting that our Prophet brother
[1:10:38] brandham was a
[1:10:42] boxer and he never was defeated
[1:10:46] amen now we too have a
[1:10:49] battle we're in a battle with the world
[1:10:53] the world is at War they're at war with
[1:10:56] one another now Champions have to be
[1:11:01] tested that's why you and I are tested
[1:11:05] every
[1:11:06] week am we're tested every week now but
[1:11:10] remember God will not allow more than
[1:11:14] what you can handle that's right that's
[1:11:17] right are you with me he will allow you
[1:11:20] to come right up against the line but he
[1:11:22] will not allow more right right and
[1:11:26] remember before you can be tested the
[1:11:29] enemy has to go and get permission from
[1:11:34] God brother Ron I'm going through a
[1:11:37] horrible test remember God gave
[1:11:40] permission that's
[1:11:42] right he gave permission and listen if
[1:11:46] God gave permission for you to go
[1:11:48] through the battle he knows you will win
[1:11:56] hallu just think about some of the
[1:11:58] messages that brother renam
[1:12:01] spoke about
[1:12:03] war spoken word is the Original Seed all
[1:12:07] through that sermon he begins to
[1:12:09] describe of the seed that came from God
[1:12:12] and what side that you're on all the way
[1:12:16] back to the Garden then from Heaven
[1:12:19] Lucifer was cast
[1:12:21] out brother Baron preaches sermons like
[1:12:24] wisdom
[1:12:26] versus Faith then he speaks sermons like
[1:12:29] things that are to be I'm not going to
[1:12:31] name them
[1:12:32] all that's a theme to give you strength
[1:12:37] to
[1:12:37] overcome then he's preaches sermons like
[1:12:40] how can I overcome sermons like he that
[1:12:45] is in you the greatest battle that's
[1:12:48] ever
[1:12:49] fought
[1:12:50] now brother Andrew came to the end of of
[1:12:54] the sermon last night and he began to
[1:12:56] name some of these sermons now I want
[1:12:59] you to understand brother brandham and
[1:13:01] many of these cases were not standing
[1:13:04] before friendly
[1:13:07] audiences he was not standing he was not
[1:13:10] standing in a message
[1:13:12] Church brother branam never preached
[1:13:16] other than his own audience that wasn't
[1:13:19] getting it but he never preached to a
[1:13:22] group like we have here today that
[1:13:25] believes the message of the
[1:13:30] hour Hallelujah so he stood against
[1:13:33] spiritual
[1:13:35] enemies that stood there before him like
[1:13:38] the blind man that he prayed for and in
[1:13:41] India to where that those those
[1:13:44] religious Powers were coming against him
[1:13:47] the Witchcraft was coming against him
[1:13:50] and if you remember after the vision
[1:13:52] that he had he challenged the those
[1:13:57] Gods he turned and challenged those Gods
[1:14:01] if your God so
[1:14:04] great come
[1:14:08] healing are you come healing and
[1:14:11] remember he became blind because he was
[1:14:15] worshiping their God that's right right
[1:14:19] but the God had accepted the
[1:14:22] challenge the Lord Jesus Christ had
[1:14:25] accepted the
[1:14:26] challenge and and I want you to
[1:14:29] understand he knew because of the
[1:14:35] vision that's almost like
[1:14:38] cheating he was looking in the future in
[1:14:42] a few minutes this man's going to have
[1:14:45] sight just like I have
[1:14:48] sight amen remember what he told brother
[1:14:51] bisco he said I looked at him and said
[1:14:55] his his hair was was dark but then in
[1:14:59] the vision I saw it was gray and his
[1:15:02] eyes were clear his eyes were good and
[1:15:05] he says I knew I knew by seeing the
[1:15:09] vision in his future he was going to
[1:15:16] see oh man you're talking about
[1:15:20] challenge listen when he preaches the
[1:15:22] church ages and goes all the way back
[1:15:24] through the church
[1:15:26] ages he is actually
[1:15:30] exposing what the devil did all the way
[1:15:33] down through the church
[1:15:35] ages that's why hate the devil hates
[1:15:39] this
[1:15:40] message cause it exposes who he is and
[1:15:45] what he
[1:15:46] does and then when the seals re believe
[1:15:49] were released it caused an invincible
[1:15:52] Army right to be released in this day
[1:15:57] right well who is that Invincible Army
[1:16:01] around the world congregations like
[1:16:06] you now listen who are we fighting
[1:16:10] against the enemy of this age right the
[1:16:15] devil that tries to take you out into Le
[1:16:20] oosa and every one of us are at war with
[1:16:24] it amen that's right brother Brandon we
[1:16:28] actually have this in my office he said

[1:21:28] your glory in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:21:31] we accept and believe what you're doing
[1:21:33] just now amen amen and amen thank you
[1:21:37] Andrew
[1:21:40] amen amen
[1:21:43] sorry brother brah said every son that
[1:21:46] is born of God has to be tried and
[1:21:50] chastened he said I remember when mine
[1:21:53] came or or my greatest hour he said when
[1:21:57] a man is born again there's a little
[1:22:01] spot like a size of a
[1:22:03] fingernail that God injects into him a
[1:22:08] system and and it falls into his heart
[1:22:12] and there it
[1:22:13] anchors I love this and then Satan makes
[1:22:17] him prove
[1:22:21] it and then Satan makes him prove it
[1:22:25] and if a if it ain't there you're
[1:22:30] gone I'm thankful to that seed of
[1:22:33] God that is constantly holding on to you
[1:22:37] listen it's not you holding on to God
[1:22:41] it's God holding on to
[1:22:44] you brother man said God doesn't make
[1:22:47] anything that
[1:22:49] perishes God is eternal and therefore
[1:22:53] this life
[1:22:55] that we are now living is only
[1:22:57] reflecting what is ahead of us the real
[1:23:01] one cannot
[1:23:04] die the body cannot perish the life
[1:23:08] cannot be taken and therefore the
[1:23:11] scriptures is right when it says that we
[1:23:16] have everlasting
[1:23:19] life I want you to think about that we
[1:23:22] have everlasting life
[1:23:25] we have eternal life and we shall never
[1:23:31] die Satan did you hear
[1:23:35] that let's just might as well remind him
[1:23:38] right now Satan did you hear that we
[1:23:41] shall never
[1:23:43] [Applause]
[1:23:45] die when you're born again you become a
[1:23:49] part of God and you are forever for
[1:23:53] eternity
[1:23:55] never to fail you're a you are a part of
[1:23:59] God you're his
[1:24:02] son I don't believe that we can put
[1:24:04] enough emphasis on that brother Ron
[1:24:07] you're preaching on a battle well I'm
[1:24:09] just taking a few moments to tell you
[1:24:11] what side we're
[1:24:13] on it's extremely important what side
[1:24:17] you're
[1:24:18] on listen if I was in a battle I
[1:24:21] wouldn't have a Russian and I don't mean
[1:24:24] anything toward the Russian people but

[1:25:06] promise hallu I'm not looking at my
[1:25:10] everyday Affair of my fight I'm looking
[1:25:13] at the
[1:25:19] promise when he took him up on a hill
[1:25:22] when when Satan took Jesus up on going
[1:25:24] to heal and set him
[1:25:28] down he rebuked him again with the
[1:25:32] word and defeated Satan with the word of
[1:25:37] God showing that that's the what the
[1:25:39] weakest of Christian can defeat Satan
[1:25:44] with thus saeth the
[1:25:46] Lord I could preach here for just a few

[1:30:09] have
[1:30:11] it they don't have it but listen when
[1:30:14] you get the Holy
[1:30:15] Ghost it seals you tell the day of your
[1:30:22] Redemption and then you got everything
[1:30:25] that you need for life's
[1:30:30] journey listen it's more than just a
[1:30:33] quote from the prophet right it's more
[1:30:36] than just a quote you've got everything
[1:30:39] you
[1:30:41] need but what is in that Jesus
[1:30:49] himself it's not some 12E education
[1:30:54] it's not some theology right it's not
[1:30:56] some intellectual ability right you got
[1:31:00] the Life of Christ and listen when you
[1:31:03] have your friend gets the Holy Ghost you
[1:31:05] know it
[1:31:07] right you know
[1:31:09] it you know
[1:31:12] it you knew it when he got it he knew it
[1:31:17] when you got it right that's
[1:31:21] right are you with me
[1:31:25] amen now brother randam said this and
[1:31:27] this may take a minute for this quote
[1:31:29] but he said you know your
[1:31:33] enemy and you trained for the
[1:31:36] contest and you're going to have to
[1:31:39] you're going to have to meet him because
[1:31:42] you're going to meet him and you'll know
[1:31:45] him and you'll know what his strength is
[1:31:49] and when you train for this contest you
[1:31:52] know you're going to meet him
[1:31:54] for that's one thing for sure you're
[1:31:56] going to meet him
[1:31:59] right and so you train for the
[1:32:02] contest and know now training for the
[1:32:05] contest is just like a
[1:32:10] boxer his enemy he's going to meet you
[1:32:14] out there in a contest to fight and a
[1:32:17] real good fighter usually knows and
[1:32:20] studies his
[1:32:22] opponent he studies his licks and he
[1:32:25] knows where he fights for and whether he
[1:32:28] leans forward or hangs back fights
[1:32:31] right-handed left-handed he studies all
[1:32:34] of this and then if he's good and smart
[1:32:37] fighter he gets him a sparring partner
[1:32:40] that'll fight just like his opponent
[1:32:43] fights for he'll know all the
[1:32:46] licks when it gets you to that
[1:32:50] place and I think a very good thing for
[1:32:53] a Christian to to do and now if you want
[1:32:55] to start training start at John
[1:33:01] 3:16 the Golden Rule right out with that
[1:33:05] and that you'll get on with the floor
[1:33:07] and and when you're trained for The
[1:33:09] Knockout punches because you're going to
[1:33:12] have to use them everybody knows that
[1:33:15] you have to train to hit your
[1:33:20] enemy now this next statement is
[1:33:22] important God God uses his word
[1:33:27] right you must remember that God uses
[1:33:31] his word to defeat his
[1:33:34] enemy well brother Ron that's everybody
[1:33:37] knows that well how much do you read
[1:33:39] your
[1:33:41] Bible how much could you say that I've
[1:33:44] got
[1:33:48] memorized then if we got an
[1:33:51] enemy and we can't fight with
[1:33:56] this we can't fight him with our
[1:33:58] strength of our arms and our legs and
[1:34:01] with our Brilliance of our mind the only
[1:34:04] way that we can defeat
[1:34:08] him is defeat him by the word of
[1:34:13] God well you say brother Ron I can't
[1:34:16] memorize scripture well that's no
[1:34:18] problem that's no problem but read it
[1:34:21] right right
[1:34:24] read it how do I get closer to God
[1:34:28] brother brandom would say it over and
[1:34:29] over read your Bible and
[1:34:40] pray I can't read well God's fixed that
[1:34:43] for you you can
[1:34:48] listen listen there's a lot of preachers
[1:34:50] that have been in the message that
[1:34:51] couldn't read and would have their wives
[1:34:55] to read the scripture to them and from
[1:35:00] that they was phenomenal preachers
[1:35:03] right phenomenal preachers listen in the
[1:35:07] message we don't have phds and llds and
[1:35:11] DDS come on what's a DD dead dog
[1:35:24] now if God could think or could give his
[1:35:27] people anything better to defeat the
[1:35:30] enemy he would have done
[1:35:32] it so as we always when a man makes a
[1:35:37] decision that's the best that there is
[1:35:41] he never ever Alters his decision we
[1:35:45] know this God doesn't change his
[1:35:49] mind God doesn't change his mind now you
[1:35:53] say well brother R I went to the Baptist
[1:35:54] Church the Methodist Church I went to
[1:35:56] Pentecostal churches what's the
[1:35:57] difference about you we don't have a
[1:35:59] board
[1:36:02] meeting and we decide what we're going
[1:36:06] to allow this coming year on we're going
[1:36:09] to allow women
[1:36:11] preachers and it's against the word
[1:36:14] we're going to allow women to cut their
[1:36:16] hair but it's against the
[1:36:19] word we're going to allow Jezebel and
[1:36:21] it's against the word
[1:36:24] we're going to allow men and it's
[1:36:26] against the
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:34] word are you with me now listen let me
[1:36:38] just say we want to stay right on the
[1:36:44] word I want to remind you of this and
[1:36:47] now we're more than conquerors we're
[1:36:50] just walk right into the into it as an
[1:36:53] inheritance
[1:36:54] more than a conqueror we're
[1:36:57] dealing with a defeated
[1:37:01] enemy I I know this is
[1:37:03] simple but if you can remind the enemy
[1:37:06] he's defeated you got him
[1:37:09] whipped you got him whipped before he
[1:37:12] walks out of the locker room that's
[1:37:14] right you got him whipped before he
[1:37:16] comes to your
[1:37:19] house before you get out of bed in the
[1:37:22] morning he's already scared of what you
[1:37:25] can do

[1:37:46] mother she was a whisper

[1:37:59] kingdom of

[1:38:06] her Bible you've seen many of them she
[1:38:08] took checks and wrote those checks out

[1:40:44] when I got into professional fighting
[1:40:46] they used to be a trainer and they
[1:40:48] called him 6C Smith
[1:40:54] and I said

[1:41:40] and come back right quick you got to if
[1:41:44] you can take the punch a hard punch your
[1:41:48] body's not used to coming back you'll
[1:41:51] lay there and take the C out but if your
[1:41:55] body's used to taking it then come back
[1:41:58] every time you hit it that shocks your
[1:42:03] blood it runs it right back to the
[1:42:06] heart and said if you do that then your
[1:42:10] body is used to coming back quick and
[1:42:13] when you get knocked down brother BR
[1:42:16] snaps his finger and you'll get right
[1:42:18] back on your feet again Hall that don't
[1:42:21] mean a thing when you get knocked down
[1:42:24] up on your feet again
[1:42:27] quick and and six second Smith said you
[1:42:30] may hate me now but you'll appreciate me
[1:42:34] when you get out there in the ring I
[1:42:37] just want to add this you may hate us
[1:42:39] preachers
[1:42:44] now you may hate us now but one
[1:42:49] day you'll appreciate us
[1:42:54] [Applause]
[1:43:03] brother B says you can't Satan you can't
[1:43:05] hold them no more they're God's children
[1:43:08] right
[1:43:11] now I'm bringing them right before
[1:43:15] you you have to take your hand off of
[1:43:18] their
[1:43:19] life they belong to God now and I
[1:43:23] claimed them for him I claimed them as
[1:43:26] trophies do you hear what he said I
[1:43:28] claimed them as trophies of Christ's
[1:43:32] love at
[1:43:33] crowy I challenge you to a
[1:43:38] debate it's good a brother Bram said I
[1:43:43] challenge you to a
[1:43:45] debate you don't have any legal power
[1:43:49] you don't have you don't have power over
[1:43:51] them you didn't have it in the first
[1:43:54] place you was only bluffing
[1:43:59] them come on I'll just tell you there's
[1:44:02] been times where all of us have been
[1:44:07] bluffed
[1:44:10] right Christ stripped you of everything
[1:44:14] that you had at Calvary he stripped
[1:44:19] you of every Power that you ever had and
[1:44:23] you're nothing but a
[1:44:30] bluff
[1:44:32] now our God is not dead but he's
[1:44:37] alive and he has the keys to death hell
[1:44:41] in the grave and he conquered everything
[1:44:46] that Satan thought he
[1:44:50] owned right he won the war
[1:44:54] more and he said I have power to lay my
[1:44:58] life down and I have power to take it up
[1:45:02] again so let's remind oursel
[1:45:05] here we're serving a living God
[1:45:10] right that ought to make you smile a
[1:45:12] little bit we're serving a living God we
[1:45:17] are not serving a historical God that's
[1:45:20] righten
[1:45:23] we're not serving a god of 2,000 years
[1:45:25] ago or even 60 or
[1:45:32] 70 you know I listen to the prayer lines
[1:45:36] brother brandom is operating in those
[1:45:38] prayer lines and sometimes we think we
[1:45:41] get this
[1:45:42] thought I wish I'd have been there
[1:45:46] Heather you ever get that thought sister
[1:45:47] Heather you ever get that thought I wish
[1:45:50] I'd have been there I think we we all we
[1:45:53] all have that thought but if we could
[1:45:55] only get realization that the same God
[1:45:58] is
[1:45:59] here that's
[1:46:01] right the same God is
[1:46:05] here sister Sue called me yesterday
[1:46:07] because all that was going on and she
[1:46:09] said brother Ron will you pray you know
[1:46:13] what I did I
[1:46:15] prayed because I knew I couldn't do
[1:46:18] anything to help her but who I represent
[1:46:24] can get everybody that's working there
[1:46:27] anoint
[1:46:29] them what about your
[1:46:32] situation are you with me sure you can
[1:46:34] pray but when you call the preacher say
[1:46:36] will you pray for me I got a situation
[1:46:39] going on it's happening right
[1:46:42] now we got a living
[1:46:45] God that's all over the world he knows
[1:46:49] your situation
[1:46:53] am I want you to understand he takes
[1:46:56] your
[1:46:59] case he has never been in a
[1:47:03] crisis Moses and them were in a crisis
[1:47:07] Jonah was in a
[1:47:10] crisis Rahab was in a crisis and me and
[1:47:14] you've been in a
[1:47:18] crisis but he's never failed
[1:47:24] he's never forgot
[1:47:27] you brother Ron I I'm in a rehab
[1:47:33] condition I'm in a nursing home he
[1:47:36] hasn't forgot you
[1:47:40] right he hasn't forgot you far as I know
[1:47:44] Sister
[1:47:45] Hoover in this shirt stayed in the
[1:47:47] nursing home longer than
[1:47:49] anybody sister Terry how long was Sister
[1:47:52] sister Hoover in a nursing
[1:47:54] home8
[1:47:57] years when we had her
[1:48:02] funeral we had a phenomenal amount of
[1:48:06] employees that came here at her
[1:48:09] funeral she may have been in a nursing
[1:48:11] home but she still lived the life come
[1:48:17] on it is are you getting it now are you
[1:48:20] getting it so God don't forget us
[1:48:31] God ever makes a decision he never
[1:48:34] changes his mind Psalms 103 and I I'm
[1:48:38] going to I'm going I'm gonna quit with
[1:48:39] this Psalms 103 and verse

[1:48:59] is within me bless His holy
[1:49:04] name bless the Lord oh my soul and
[1:49:09] forget not his benefits his mind's still

[1:49:24] I find all of that phenomenal he may not
[1:49:26] remember what he had for breakfast this
[1:49:28] morning but he can quote the scriptures
[1:49:30] with
[1:49:32] me verse three I'm sorry who forgiveth
[1:49:37] all thine iniquities who Health all thy

[2:14:05] Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord Jesus we come
[2:14:08] before you today Lord in your presence
[2:14:11] Lord Lord we realize that the Gates of
[2:14:14] Hell have certainly set themsel against
[2:14:17] us Lord in many a way we have come
[2:14:20] through the battles oh god of our
[2:14:23] flesh we've come through the battles in
[2:14:26] the spiritual realm on all things we see
[2:14:28] the gates of hell that are set there
[2:14:30] before
[2:14:31] us Lord a prophet would teach us that
[2:14:34] that's the strongest part of the city
[2:14:37] it's in
[2:14:38] Gates but not just a man but our Lord
[2:14:42] stood there and you took men like
[2:14:46] brother Matthew brother William myself
[2:14:49] brother Ron some men that were going to
[2:14:52] follow you may not look like the
[2:14:54] strongest and the greatest of men in the
[2:14:56] crowd but you took them and said now
[2:14:59] this is what I'm going to tell you
[2:15:00] boys that the Gates of Hell will not be
[2:15:03] able to Prevail against
[2:15:05] you father we realize Lord Jesus that we
[2:15:08] are in a moment in time where the Gates
[2:15:10] of Hell have set themselves against the
[2:15:13] Bride of Jesus Christ we realize father
[2:15:16] that we have received a revelation from
[2:15:18] on high that has placed us in a position
[2:15:21] that we realize that no weapon that is
[2:15:23] formed against the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:15:26] it can scream it can holler it can talk
[2:15:29] about how powerful that it is but it
[2:15:31] ain't powerful enough to stop us so
[2:15:34] father We join our faith together Lord
[2:15:37] you know that we realize that in the
[2:15:39] mouth of two or three Witnesses let
[2:15:41] everything be established and father we
[2:15:45] recognize you as our healer we recognize
[2:15:48] the moment that we are in is a
[2:15:51] supernatural predestinated moment so
[2:15:55] father we just speak into the atmosphere
[2:15:57] of the things that we've receive right
[2:16:00] now in your
[2:16:03] name little
[2:16:05] bride I'm going to ask you just to turn
[2:16:08] your mouth loose just for a
[2:16:10] minute no matter who's beside you I want
[2:16:14] you to
[2:16:16] say I want you to say what you
[2:16:19] want I want you to say say what you want
[2:16:21] to
[2:16:22] receive I want you to be very diligent
[2:16:25] in this not just positive thinking here
[2:16:29] but I want you to put the word of God
[2:16:30] behind your lips say it is
[2:16:35] written I
[2:16:37] believe therefore I
[2:16:42] speak Healing Rain it's falling now
[2:16:48] healing rain is fall fall in
[2:16:52] down I'm not
[2:16:57] afraid I'm not
[2:17:00] afraid we don't have to be afraid of
[2:17:03] cancer we got a witness in this place
[2:17:06] Brother Andy hk's here he's a living
[2:17:09] witness that God is greater than
[2:17:13] cancer I got a I got an uncle my Uncle
[2:17:17] Mar at stage four colon cancer
[2:17:21] and according to doctor should have been
[2:17:24] dead but healing rain fell down on Mark
[2:17:26] Spencer that
[2:17:27] [Music]
[2:17:29] day I got a daddy that should have been
[2:17:32] dead 5 years ago I'm Not Afraid what
[2:17:35] Healing Rain can do so I'm not afraid of
[2:17:38] whatever you come up against no matter
[2:17:40] what's the complex is no matter what the
[2:17:43] situation is no matter how far you are
[2:17:48] going if you just let him him do the
[2:17:52] work you'll see the thing manifest that
[2:17:55] you just spoke in this atmosphere this
[2:17:57] ain't just an atmosphere of church
[2:17:59] people this is the atmosphere of the
[2:18:01] Queen of
[2:18:03] Heaven something has
[2:18:08] changed can I say it something has
[2:18:11] changed for sister Esther Smith can I

[2:18:36] that skin becoming like baby skin real
[2:18:40] close I'd say this to you don't be
[2:18:42] afraid to ask for the
[2:18:45] impossible I say it's what brother Rong
[2:18:47] was talking about today what Satan was
[2:18:50] trying to stop if you'll battle against
[2:18:52] that power that's trying to stop you
[2:18:55] you'll recognize the healing power that
[2:18:58] comes behind the
[2:19:00] battle that's where MDC showed up to
[2:19:03] Abraham was after the battle after the
[2:19:07] battles where mzc showed up I say it's
[2:19:10] worth battling
[2:19:11] for come on so this is more than just a
[2:19:14] little guy from South Africa this is a
[2:19:17] king of Heaven that is showing up after
[2:19:19] every one of your battles
[2:19:21] he's not just coming to Ron Spencer he's
[2:19:22] coming to Brandon Hill he he he's coming
[2:19:25] to brother Danny he's coming to brother
[2:19:26] Jason he's coming because he's that kind
[2:19:28] of a
[2:19:29] God if you battle for him for a just and
[2:19:34] righteous cause mzc will show
[2:19:39] up and you may not recognize it right
[2:19:42] now and I I
[2:19:44] just it could be in a moment when you
[2:19:47] least expect it brother Doug and things
[2:19:49] just just change
[2:19:51] we're making plans for the summer we're
[2:19:53] making those plans but all of a sudden
[2:19:55] something could come and just change
[2:19:56] those plans and no longer we planning to
[2:19:59] walk down the streets of Port Republic
[2:20:01] and walking down the streets of maybe
[2:20:02] New Market but we're walking down
[2:20:04] streets of gold locked arms together and
[2:20:07] it was worth it it was worth the battles
[2:20:10] that we went through a family battles
[2:20:12] and situations of
[2:20:15] life because MDC showed up to us
[2:20:19] [Music]
