[48:13] morning i' ask you to turn with me to
[48:15] the book of
[48:16] Colossians Colossians the first
[48:21] chapter and we're going to read there
[48:23] from verse 13
[48:29] Colossians 1 and13 ain't it good to be a
[48:31] Christian this morning amen we sure
[48:33] appreciated the presence of the Lord
[48:35] here last night appreciated the part you
[48:38] played in that as you pulled on the word
[48:40] and as you entered in and worshiped with
[48:42] your whole heart as as you always do we
[48:44] thank you for that we appreciate you so
[48:46] much Colossians 1 and
[48:51] 13 and pray you'll just have Grace for
[48:54] me this morning I have quite a few
[48:56] things I'd like to to read and maybe it
[48:57] won't be the same Pace as last night but
[48:59] I believe that that God's in his word
[49:01] and we're going to have a good time amen
[49:03] verse 13 says who hath delivered us from
[49:07] the power of darkness and hath
[49:08] translated us into the kingdom of his
[49:10] dear son in whom we have Redemption
[49:13] through his blood even the Forgiveness
[49:16] of sins who is the image of the
[49:19] invisible God that's something we're
[49:21] going to be looking at today the
[49:23] firstborn of every creature for by him
[49:25] were all things created created that are
[49:27] in heaven and that are in Earth visible
[49:29] and invisible whether they be Thrones or
[49:32] dominions or principalities or Powers
[49:34] all things were created by Him and for
[49:37] him and he is before all things and by
[49:41] him all things consist amen I pray that
[49:45] the Lord will add a blessing as you have
[49:47] your seats this morning there to the
[49:49] reading of the word also want to read
[49:51] one verse in 1 Timothy
[49:53] 1 1 Timothy 1 and verse 17 says now unto
[49:57] the king Eternal
[50:00] Immortal
[50:02] invisible the only wise God be honor and
[50:06] Glory forever and ever amen amen so I'd
[50:10] like to speak to you this morning on the
[50:11] thought the Unseen becoming manifest the
[50:15] Unseen becoming manifest or the
[50:18] invisible being made visible amen so so
[50:22] the scripture here makes it very plain
[50:24] as as we read through the scriptures
[50:26] that God is a spirit and also that being
[50:29] a spirit he is invisible amen John 4:24
[50:33] tells us that God is a spirit and and we
[50:35] just read there in first Timothy that
[50:37] he's invisible so we worship an
[50:39] invisible God and that's just something
[50:42] that that we understand we worship an
[50:43] invisible God and and if we start there
[50:46] in Genesis 1 and look through the
[50:47] scripture we we we see there that that
[50:50] he begins to create the heavens and the
[50:52] Earth but but if we go back Beyond
[50:55] Genesis 1
[50:57] and and really the only way we're able
[50:58] to do that is there was a prophet in
[51:00] this day that that took us back before
[51:02] that time but if we go back Beyond
[51:04] Genesis 1 but back before um the what we
[51:08] would call the beginning if we go back
[51:10] before time ever began back into the
[51:13] eternals as it were where there was no
[51:15] moon and there was no stars and and
[51:18] there was there was no nothing and
[51:20] really for us that's very hard for us to
[51:22] to grasp that's hard for us to wrap our
[51:24] minds around because we're time
[51:26] creatures
[51:27] everything we've ever known is time we
[51:28] Mark time and hours and days and months
[51:31] and years we have calendars and watches
[51:33] and don't want to be late church starts
[51:35] at this time and the the party starts at
[51:37] this time and I have a birthday
[51:39] everything marks time but there was a
[51:41] time if I can say it like that I'm I'm
[51:43] contradicting myself here there was a
[51:45] time where there was no
[51:46] time okay there was a time where there
[51:49] was nothing and and though those things
[51:51] um um there was nothing once again we've
[51:53] always known tangible we've always known
[51:55] the world to exist and to be able to
[51:58] touch things but there was a time when
[51:59] there was no time and there was nothing
[52:02] there there was nothing tangible at all
[52:04] and and and in that time it was before
[52:07] God was even God right you know because
[52:10] God dwelt all alone with himself there
[52:13] was no one and there was nothing to
[52:15] worship Him and therefore since nothing
[52:17] could worship him he wasn't God because
[52:19] God is an object of worship so at this
[52:22] point maybe we'll just call we could
[52:24] call him the great Eternal one the the
[52:26] Great eternal spirit you know and he was
[52:29] invisible but all that God was and all
[52:33] that God is all of his word and all of
[52:37] himself he wanted to become manifested
[52:40] he wasn't going to let it always be
[52:43] invisible he wasn't always going to be
[52:45] alone he wanted it to become manifested
[52:48] he he had you in his mind he had the
[52:51] Earth in his mind and he wanted these
[52:53] things to become visible amen so if we
[52:57] go back to that place before there was
[52:59] anything the prophet says and there that
[53:02] great space where no one can fathom in
[53:05] their mind beyond that that space
[53:08] eternity that's Jehovah God out there
[53:12] and we're taught in the beginning that
[53:14] the logos or the Son of God went out of
[53:18] God so as we start right there the logos
[53:22] was a part of God that went out from God
[53:26] so back there in this place that we're
[53:28] talking about where there's no time
[53:29] there's nothing just empty and in that
[53:33] time the logos comes out of God so so
[53:36] the logos comes out and brother Bram
[53:38] says that the logos was God's first body
[53:42] form he would describe it as a a little
[53:45] white light or a Halo and it was the son
[53:48] of God it was the word of God the logos
[53:52] that would later become flesh amen so as
[53:55] the logos comes out out of God this
[53:57] light would be the first time that we
[54:00] could ever describe God as
[54:03] visible it's the first time that you
[54:05] could ever see God because Spirit God is
[54:09] invisible but this light the logos was
[54:13] part of him and it was gone out from him
[54:16] and it was a visible
[54:18] manifestation of God Amen it was the
[54:21] word of God it was the son of God and it
[54:23] would become flesh and dwell amongst us
[54:26] the prophet said so he first was god
[54:29] Jehovah and out of him let's just
[54:32] picture now a little drama so you can
[54:34] get it let let's see coming out of space
[54:37] where there's nothing it's a little a
[54:39] little white light like a Mystic light
[54:41] like a Halo and that was the logos that
[54:44] went out of God in the beginning that
[54:47] was the son of God that came out from
[54:49] the bosom of the father that was what
[54:52] was in the beginning was the word and
[54:54] the Word was with God and the Word was
[54:56] God and the Word was made flesh and
[54:58] dwelt amongst us in the beginning was
[55:00] God and then out of God came the logos a
[55:03] part of God that went out of God and I
[55:06] just want to labor on this a little bit
[55:08] because we're talking about the the the
[55:10] invisible being made manifest or or the
[55:12] Unseen being made manifest and the
[55:15] prophet says setting way back in
[55:16] eternity there was God and then going
[55:19] out of God or God unfolding himself
[55:23] comes the logos which was the son of God
[55:26] or the word of God in the beginning was
[55:29] the word and the Word was with God and
[55:30] the Word was God and the Word was made
[55:33] flesh and dwelt amongst us he says the
[55:36] logos so so I want to drive something
[55:39] home here just very early on is that the
[55:41] word of God will always be made manifest
[55:45] the word of God will not remain
[55:47] invisible it will always produce what it
[55:50] was intended to produce amen the the the
[55:54] word will not remain unseen if will not
[55:56] remain unfulfilled it will not be sent
[55:59] out and return unto God empty okay in
[56:02] other words it didn't come forth out of
[56:04] God and him still remain
[56:06] invisible he didn't speak this word or
[56:08] this part of him didn't come out and you
[56:10] still see nothing but when the word or
[56:13] the logos came forth immediately we have
[56:17] visibility immediately there's something
[56:19] that we can see we have a manifestation
[56:22] we have something that we can see and
[56:23] say that's God that's God Amen John 1:1
[56:28] says in the beginning was the word and
[56:31] the Word was with God and the Word was
[56:34] God now we take this as Believers and we
[56:37] read and we go down to verse 14 John
[56:40] 1:14 it says and the Word was made flesh
[56:44] and dwelt amongst us now we connect the
[56:46] two scriptures right there it's just
[56:48] obvious to us right that the the word
[56:50] was with God the Word was God and then
[56:52] the word was made flesh and dwelt
[56:53] amongst us and we see Jesus right there
[56:56] and because of that we see one
[56:58] God it's obvious to us and and we see
[57:02] that the word was there but but to to
[57:04] other people they read right there and
[57:07] they see where it says the word was with
[57:10] God and and they make it two co-equal
[57:14] separate
[57:16] deities because it says well there was
[57:18] there was there was God and the word and
[57:20] the Word was with God and so they see
[57:23] two to two co-equal co-eternal
[57:26] deities but I want to explain something
[57:28] right here that the language used here
[57:30] does not indicate another person being
[57:33] with God but it is an indication that
[57:36] God has changed
[57:38] forms it's showing you a change in forms
[57:41] the the logos has come forth from God
[57:44] and that logos is visible he has gone
[57:47] it's just saying God has gone from
[57:49] invisible to
[57:51] visible you can now see him or simply
[57:54] put it's another expression of God it's
[57:57] God unfolding himself it's God
[57:59] expressing himself he has now become
[58:02] manifested and I'll use a word we're
[58:04] used to using in the pillar of fire god
[58:07] is now visible in the pillar of fire
[58:09] when Moses met God in the burning bush
[58:11] what was it it was the logos it was God
[58:15] made visible the word came forth from
[58:17] God and as it did it manifested God or
[58:21] it made an invisible God visible amen
[58:25] because God's word always brings forth
[58:29] God's word always manifests itself it
[58:31] always does to to to the human eyes the
[58:34] promise may still be invisible this
[58:36] morning now stay with me for a second it
[58:39] may still be invisible it's still only a
[58:41] promise it's still only a word but the
[58:45] Fulfillment of the promise is what makes
[58:48] it become visible there comes a time
[58:51] where the promise that you're holding is
[58:53] going to become visible it doesn't go
[58:56] out and return empty right now it's
[58:58] still invisible right now it's just a
[59:00] word but what you're holding on for will
[59:03] become made manifest it will become
[59:06] visible because it's not always going to
[59:09] remain just in word form it must
[59:12] manifest that
[59:14] word
[59:16] hallelujah the prophet says and now I
[59:18] can see him as he moves over here and he
[59:22] draws into his memory or his mind
[59:26] a picture of what the world should be
[59:30] now there's not a star or nothing I love
[59:35] that he draws in his mind the great
[59:38] architect there before there was
[59:40] anything the great designer of it all
[59:43] drawing plans up in his mind and I want
[59:46] to tell you that this point as he's
[59:48] drawing those plans up in his mind as
[59:51] he's thinking these thoughts it's all
[59:53] already done it's all already finished
[59:57] because his thoughts are Eternal and his
[59:59] thoughts are perfect he doesn't have to
[1:00:01] rethink them he doesn't have to redo
[1:00:03] them right there while he's sitting
[1:00:05] there thinking of what it's going to be
[1:00:07] like he already thought of the earth he
[1:00:09] already thought of you he created the
[1:00:11] Earth to draw you out from the earth
[1:00:14] right there you were already going to be
[1:00:16] here you you are you are an attribute of
[1:00:19] God a thought of God and and the Earth
[1:00:21] is as well and he creates the Earth what
[1:00:23] for to draw you out from that Earth he's
[1:00:28] already thinking listen it's already
[1:00:30] finished the victory's already won
[1:00:32] calvary's already happened redemption's
[1:00:34] already happened the rapture's already
[1:00:36] happened it's all being sealed the
[1:00:39] minute he thinks it he can't go back on
[1:00:41] it the minute he thought it right there
[1:00:44] it was already
[1:00:46] finished
[1:00:48] hallelujah it's all
[1:00:50] done brother Brown says I can hear him
[1:00:52] say let there be light and an Adam burst
[1:00:56] Yonder and the Sun come into existence
[1:00:59] deity she begins to whirl millions of
[1:01:03] years rolled by and after a while a
[1:01:06] piece flew off it star he says and he
[1:01:10] stood there and watched it and it went
[1:01:12] all down and he stopped it over here
[1:01:14] after it fell a few million
[1:01:17] years off went another one he let it
[1:01:19] fall to a certain place and he stopped
[1:01:21] it what's he doing he's got in his mind
[1:01:25] now that that someday there'll be an
[1:01:27] earth there'll be mankind on the earth
[1:01:31] listen he said let there be and it
[1:01:33] didn't matter how long it
[1:01:35] took he said let there be and it didn't
[1:01:38] matter if it was millions of years it
[1:01:40] didn't matter if it was billions of
[1:01:42] years those thoughts was already in his
[1:01:44] mind they were invisible they were only
[1:01:46] thoughts but then they became a word
[1:01:49] released and when they released the word
[1:01:51] it was still invisible even had you been
[1:01:54] there to hear him say it it was still
[1:01:56] invisible but the Unseen was going to
[1:02:00] become seen the Unseen was going to
[1:02:03] become made manifest the invisible was
[1:02:05] going to be made visible the the the
[1:02:08] word was going to take on the form of
[1:02:10] what it was spoke to do he said let
[1:02:12] there be light it didn't matter if it
[1:02:14] took a million billion years there was
[1:02:17] going to come light that word wasn't
[1:02:20] going to return unto him void listen
[1:02:22] stars were coming Earth was coming
[1:02:26] mankind was coming what am I telling you
[1:02:29] your Victory is coming the healing is
[1:02:31] coming the Deliverance is coming your
[1:02:34] health is coming the body change is
[1:02:36] coming the Rapture is coming it's
[1:02:38] already been smoked it can't be stopped

[1:02:44] toothpaste do been squeezed out can't
[1:02:47] put it back in the tube it's going to
[1:02:49] become
[1:02:51] manifested once it's spoken it's got to
[1:02:54] happen
[1:02:57] light was
[1:02:59] coming it had been
[1:03:05] spoken it will be
[1:03:08] seen the word's already been spoke over
[1:03:11] you brother Aaron I'm in the darkest
[1:03:13] time light's
[1:03:15] coming I'm in the hardest time your
[1:03:17] Victory is coming that word wasn't just
[1:03:20] released into nothing it was released
[1:03:22] over your life there was a word released
[1:03:25] over the Earth
[1:03:26] and we get caught up in time because
[1:03:29] we're time creatures and I've been in
[1:03:31] this trial 14 years now brother Aron
[1:03:34] I've been in this trial now for three
[1:03:36] years now brother Aaron that's okay
[1:03:39] Victory is coming the answer is on its
[1:03:41] way it's already been released in The
[1:03:44] Invisible now the victory that's
[1:03:46] invisible to you the healing that's
[1:03:48] invisible to you that the things that
[1:03:49] haven't become clear will be made
[1:03:52] manifest in your life Hallelujah
[1:03:56] listen I know it I I know it's written
[1:03:58] down in the Bible I know it's in our
[1:04:01] mind I know it's in our heart we read
[1:04:03] these things and we believe it but if I
[1:04:05] was you I would start to take those
[1:04:07] words and I would start to put them on
[1:04:10] my lips and I would begin to speak the
[1:04:12] things I have need of the prophet of God
[1:04:15] told us that when a when a Believer
[1:04:16] takes the word of God and puts it up on
[1:04:18] his lips it's the same as deity speaking
[1:04:21] he says Every Mountain has to move Satan
[1:04:24] cannot stand before that mountain so I
[1:04:26] just want to say that if deity speaking
[1:04:28] this word created the galaxies created
[1:04:31] the Stars created the worlds then deity
[1:04:34] speaking this word can bring healing to
[1:04:36] a body it can bring Salvation to a soul
[1:04:39] it can bring restoration to a home what
[1:04:42] you need this morning speak what you
[1:04:44] have need of speak what you have need of
[1:04:47] take it and put it on your lips and
[1:04:49] speak it and watch it manifest a visible
[1:04:52] victory in your
[1:04:54] life Hal
[1:04:58] hallelujah what does manifest
[1:05:00] mean manifest in the dictionary means
[1:05:04] clear to the eye to make evident or
[1:05:07] certain by showing or
[1:05:11] displaying
[1:05:13] amen a
[1:05:15] promise isn't
[1:05:17] manifested until it
[1:05:19] happens if if I'm speaking of the past
[1:05:22] and I tell you something happened and it
[1:05:24] didn't happen
[1:05:26] then I I
[1:05:27] lied all right if we're talking of past
[1:05:30] events that that that's just a lie okay
[1:05:32] but when speaking of the
[1:05:34] future anything I tell you is going to
[1:05:37] happen the truth of it is yet to be
[1:05:42] determined the truth of it even if it's
[1:05:44] not a lie because sometimes it don't
[1:05:46] happen because of
[1:05:48] circumstance but it's only
[1:05:50] truth if it
[1:05:53] happens do we understand so so if I tell
[1:05:56] you something the truth of it is yet to
[1:05:57] be determined no matter what if it
[1:06:00] doesn't happen it wasn't truth
[1:06:03] regardless of
[1:06:05] intention regardless if it was on
[1:06:08] purpose if it doesn't happen it wasn't
[1:06:10] true it's just not truth so so physical
[1:06:14] words spoken or or or or written words
[1:06:17] have no truth until it
[1:06:21] happens there's no truth until it
[1:06:23] manifests the the the Manifest ation of
[1:06:26] those words into something tangible into
[1:06:29] fulfillment is what makes it truth amen
[1:06:33] and that goes for anyone that's right
[1:06:38] and that goes for
[1:06:39] anything God is only as good as his
[1:06:44] wordu prophet of God says if God made a
[1:06:47] promise God's got to keep his promise if
[1:06:51] he doesn't he isn't God he said that's
[1:06:54] the way you do with healing you throw
[1:06:56] yourself at his Mercy he promised it
[1:06:58] it's his word he's got to he's got to
[1:07:02] fulfill his word if he isn't he isn't
[1:07:05] God he says in no man's word or no man
[1:07:09] is any better than his word if I don't
[1:07:11] keep my word then I'm not much and if
[1:07:14] God doesn't keep his word he isn't God
[1:07:16] but if God does keep his word then he
[1:07:19] ever remains God in order to be God he's
[1:07:22] got to keep his word you see he's got to
[1:07:25] keep his word you see I could tell you
[1:07:28] that I could just give you an example
[1:07:30] and say well okay well you're moving on
[1:07:32] Tuesday well brother I'm gonna come help
[1:07:34] you
[1:07:35] move and I could mean it I can mean it
[1:07:38] with my whole heart yeah I'm going to be
[1:07:40] there every intention perfect and pure
[1:07:43] and yet due to unforeseen
[1:07:46] circumstances I'm unable to come through
[1:07:48] on my promise now you can say a lot if
[1:07:52] you want but let's just lean this way
[1:07:54] and say what I said was wasn't the
[1:07:59] truth well I said I had pure intentions
[1:08:02] so I mean I wanted to come move your
[1:08:04] sofa down the stairs I
[1:08:08] promise but things didn't work out so
[1:08:11] what I told you was not true it was not
[1:08:14] a a true
[1:08:16] statement and yet here's the great thing
[1:08:18] about God is God's word cannot be
[1:08:22] derailed by circumstance
[1:08:26] okay because God's not a time being like
[1:08:28] we talked about so he's not speaking
[1:08:30] from a place of I'm going to he's not
[1:08:33] speaking from a place of I'm going to
[1:08:35] he's speaking from a place of I already
[1:08:38] did it you're already healed you're
[1:08:41] already saved I was the lamb slain
[1:08:44] before the foundation of the world he's
[1:08:46] given you fulfilled promises he's given
[1:08:50] you promises that he's already come
[1:08:52] through on he can't be unsain a he's
[1:08:56] already slain you can't be unhealed by
[1:08:59] his stripes you were healed he's
[1:09:03] speaking from a place of It's Already
[1:09:06] Done circumstances can't change what
[1:09:09] it's already been done for you in your
[1:09:12] life
[1:09:13] Hallelujah he's already delivered you
[1:09:17] he's already fulfilled the promises that
[1:09:19] you're standing on but right now it may
[1:09:22] be
[1:09:23] unseen but I want you to know that the
[1:09:25] invisible is about to be made visible in
[1:09:28] your
[1:09:29] life those things are about to be made
[1:09:31] manifest it's going to be manifest
[1:09:33] because the word has been released and
[1:09:36] it's got to accomplish its goal in order
[1:09:38] for him to be God
[1:09:41] hallelujah why because it's truth and
[1:09:44] truth is based in fulfillment so if it's
[1:09:47] truth it must be fulfilled I ask you is
[1:09:51] God's word true today then prepare for
[1:09:54] the Fulfillment of the Unseen the things
[1:09:57] you've been longing for hoping for
[1:09:59] holding on to they're coming maybe not
[1:10:03] today maybe not tomorrow but they're on
[1:10:06] the way that's the word of God it must
[1:10:09] come to
[1:10:10] pass

[1:10:49] of fickle men I'm so thankful that I

[1:10:55] that doctor don't have the final say in
[1:10:56] your health his word is unchanging he
[1:10:59] said Your name's on the Lamb's Book of
[1:11:01] Life I can't take it off you can't take

[1:11:07] healed you sickness can't overcome you
[1:11:10] you're going to overcome it these aren't
[1:11:12] my promises to keep they're his promises
[1:11:14] oh everything's falling apart but he
[1:11:17] said I will have a church without spot
[1:11:20] or without wrinkle so it's going to be
[1:11:22] there it's going to happen I don't care
[1:11:25] and if this one Falls and that one Falls
[1:11:27] he will have a
[1:11:30] church Hallelujah it will be made
[1:11:39] manifest his word
[1:11:42] unchanging what what good does it do us
[1:11:44] to talk about the Miracles if he ain't
[1:11:46] still The Miracle
[1:11:49] Worker what good is it to talk about the
[1:11:52] blood if it's lost its
[1:11:53] power what good is it to get the Holy
[1:11:56] Ghost if it don't keep us from
[1:11:59] sin come on now the Holy Ghost gives us
[1:12:01] power over sin it keeps us from our sins
[1:12:05] well I got the Holy Ghost brother but
[1:12:07] I'm still struggling with
[1:12:13] pornography I just say it no you
[1:12:18] don't because he sent the Holy Ghost in
[1:12:20] This Day in its fullness and with the
[1:12:24] fullness of that and the adoption age it
[1:12:26] gives you the power to overcome to lay
[1:12:29] aside the sins that so easily beset you
[1:12:32] hey I know I was up I was down I
[1:12:35] struggled I was in I was out but one day
[1:12:39] I stepped into the presence of the lust
[1:12:41] the pillar of fire and it changed my
[1:12:43] life forever where I couldn't now I can
[1:12:47] where I fa now I stand I am an overcomer
[1:12:51] and it's not by what I've done but it's
[1:12:53] the power of the invisible God being
[1:12:56] made visible in my life
[1:13:04] Hallelujah he's still God
[1:13:08] today his word is still the truth today
[1:13:11] and every promise will come to pass
[1:13:13] exactly as he
[1:13:15] said
[1:13:17] Hallelujah hey we're going to do this
[1:13:18] again
[1:13:30] but if I hadn't been I'm
[1:13:43] sorry love you
[1:13:47] buddy so it's faith in the Unseen that
[1:13:51] eventually makes it
[1:13:53] seemen faith in The Invisible ible is
[1:13:55] what's going to make it
[1:13:57] visible look we don't live by sight I'm
[1:13:59] not telling you to go around living by
[1:14:01] sight we live by
[1:14:02] faith but our faith will be made sight
[1:14:07] that's the whole point of
[1:14:08] Faith it's not just to walk around in
[1:14:11] faith never seeing anything
[1:14:12] fulfilled I believe in focusing on faith
[1:14:15] you know but it's kind of like this I I
[1:14:17] believe in prophecies but eventually
[1:14:19] prophecy got to become fulfilled
[1:14:21] prophecy can't say prophecy forever or
[1:14:23] it ain't true
[1:14:25] it's got to be fulfilled a lot of people
[1:14:27] fall in love with the prophecies and
[1:14:29] hate the Fulfillment it's exactly what
[1:14:31] happened with the Pharisees they loved
[1:14:33] every one of the prophecies but when the
[1:14:34] Fulfillment stood in front of them they
[1:14:36] didn't like it so our faith has to
[1:14:38] become sight the prophet of God says now
[1:14:41] if God makes a promise in the Bible and
[1:14:43] then if you receive that the
[1:14:45] supernatural promise will make a
[1:14:48] supernatural manifestation because God
[1:14:51] will vindicate his word absolutely
[1:14:55] so the whole point so far God's word's
[1:14:58] going to be made manifest amen God's
[1:15:01] word comes by hearing and and we know
[1:15:03] that and we believe that and we don't
[1:15:05] have to see the Bel we've been taught
[1:15:07] well enough to know better than that but
[1:15:09] we're going to see because we believe
[1:15:12] amen there are many many examples down
[1:15:15] through the scriptures where those who
[1:15:17] who who would look to the Unseen with
[1:15:20] faith and therefore the Unseen would
[1:15:22] become seen Noah never saw what fall
[1:15:25] from the
[1:15:26] sky Noah lived in where there were no
[1:15:29] clouds it was a blue sky all the time
[1:15:32] never seen a cloud before but God
[1:15:35] released a word that said it's going to
[1:15:37] rain and it was
[1:15:39] invisible and it remained invisible for
[1:15:42] 120
[1:15:44] years amen it didn't matter though that
[1:15:47] it took 120 years it was a word that was
[1:15:51] going to come to pass no matter what and
[1:15:55] because Noah believed that that that
[1:15:57] that God's word must but to pass then he
[1:15:59] was prepared for it and I want to say
[1:16:01] right here that your preparation to
[1:16:04] receive shows how much you
[1:16:08] believe that's like the third time I've
[1:16:10] rhymed and I'm not trying to please
[1:16:16] yeah your preparation to receive shows
[1:16:20] how much you believe now if Noah got
[1:16:22] that promise and he went and sit around
[1:16:24] and done nothing and made his wife kick
[1:16:27] him out of bed every
[1:16:29] day hang on
[1:16:32] now and sit around going guys it's going
[1:16:34] to rain it's going to rain it's going to
[1:16:37] rain well what are you doing about I'm
[1:16:39] just just trust me it's going to rain
[1:16:42] but there was no preparation to receive
[1:16:44] what he was professing to believe then I
[1:16:47] don't care how much he said it was going
[1:16:49] to rain Noah didn't believe it was going
[1:16:52] to rain okay you know it's kind of
[1:16:54] reminds me of Zachariah there in the
[1:16:56] Bible when the angel came and said to
[1:16:58] him you're going to have a child and he
[1:17:00] said how can this be you know what if
[1:17:03] you if you read Zachariah and his wife
[1:17:05] have been praying for a child but then
[1:17:07] here comes the Fulfillment he says no
[1:17:09] that can't be come on and it makes me
[1:17:11] wonder are we expecting to receive the
[1:17:13] things we're actually praying
[1:17:16] for are you expecting it to happen are
[1:17:20] we living every day in expectation
[1:17:23] because a lot of us are saying there's a
[1:17:25] Rapture coming there's a Rapture coming
[1:17:26] there's a Rapture coming and you are
[1:17:28] doing nothing to be ready to take that
[1:17:30] Rapture but I'm telling you if you
[1:17:32] believe the rapture's coming there's a
[1:17:35] preparation to be made you got to apply
[1:17:38] the token you got to get in the ark you
[1:17:40] got to check up you got to make sure you
[1:17:43] got to live daily as if this is the day
[1:17:46] because I'm expecting it to happen this
[1:17:48] very
[1:17:50] moment your preparation shows how much
[1:17:53] you believe
[1:17:55] right what does expect mean because I
[1:17:58] say we got to leave live with
[1:18:02] expectations expect means to believe
[1:18:04] that someone or something will arrive
[1:18:10] soon it's not a maybe so it's not a hope
[1:18:14] so it's
[1:18:17] expectation and I've used this example
[1:18:19] before but you know how it is when
[1:18:20] you're expecting
[1:18:22] company you tend to go around and tidy
[1:18:25] up some things and make sure things look
[1:18:26] good and make it look like it never does
[1:18:28] unless somebody's coming
[1:18:37] over I'm talking about the yard my
[1:18:39] wife's house always looks good I'm
[1:18:41] talking about the yard I weed eat things
[1:18:42] I don't usually weed eat and mow things
[1:18:45] a little better because companies's
[1:18:46] coming I'm expecting them but you know
[1:18:49] what happens when they show up
[1:18:52] unannounced is sometimes they find
[1:18:54] things may be a little
[1:18:57] unkempt they find things in a condition
[1:18:59] that i' have rather them not find it in
[1:19:03] because you want things ready when they
[1:19:05] show
[1:19:06] up what I'm telling you is a prophet has
[1:19:09] come and made it very very very very
[1:19:10] clear that he's coming that he's on the
[1:19:13] way and it's going to happen in this day
[1:19:16] you don't have an excuse for him to find
[1:19:18] your house unkempt you don't have an
[1:19:20] excuse for him to find your yard not
[1:19:21] ready to receive him I'm telling you get
[1:19:24] ready wake up quit hitting the snooze
[1:19:26] button get up because he's going to show
[1:19:29] up and I don't want you to be caught
[1:19:31] unprepared we got to be expecting him
[1:19:33] he's coming company's coming he's coming
[1:19:37] soon get everything ready live ready
[1:19:40] talk ready act ready do everything ready
[1:19:44] to go because he's on the way I want to
[1:19:47] know are we expecting him to show up are
[1:19:51] we expecting it to manifest the Rapture
[1:19:53] can't always in promised form it's got
[1:19:57] to manifest itself it's got to happen
[1:20:00] and there's got to be a people going I
[1:20:02] know it's going to happen I'm expecting
[1:20:04] it to happen I'm going to receive it
[1:20:07] when it
[1:20:08] happens
[1:20:11] hallelujah it's
[1:20:14] expectation and I believe God has proven
[1:20:16] time after time that he's
[1:20:18] trustworthy that we can trust him that
[1:20:21] he keeps his appointments that he does
[1:20:22] what he says that his word never fail we
[1:20:26] got to be under expectation every single
[1:20:28] day every single service this is the
[1:20:31] service this is the manifestation today
[1:20:34] is the Fulfillment it's been so far
[1:20:37] unseen by my natural eye but today is
[1:20:40] the
[1:20:40] day today is the day I always think
[1:20:43] about Abraham sitting there in the tent
[1:20:45] door
[1:20:46] watching what if that had just been that
[1:20:48] day where he said you know what I've sat
[1:20:50] here every
[1:20:51] day you know I'm just going to go over
[1:20:54] here for a little bit
[1:20:55] bit and the Lord passes right by the
[1:20:58] tent and he misses it we can't take a
[1:21:00] break in our
[1:21:02] watchfulness we can't get we can't get
[1:21:04] sloth in the way we live our lives we
[1:21:07] can't get too comfortable we can't get
[1:21:09] too comfortable down in Babylon to where
[1:21:12] when the king said go back and build the
[1:21:13] city almost none of them went back
[1:21:15] because they'd been comfortable living
[1:21:17] where they were living live mixing with
[1:21:19] the Babylonians listening to Babylonian
[1:21:21] music feeding on Babylonian
[1:21:23] entertainment wearing Babylonian
[1:21:26] garments they had become
[1:21:29] comfortable listen we all we we we it
[1:21:32] says it's like a smoke that comes up
[1:21:33] from the bottomless pit you ever gone
[1:21:35] camping
[1:21:36] before and then like a maybe a month
[1:21:39] later find something that you somehow
[1:21:40] know didn't get washed and what's it
[1:21:42] still smell like smoke Smoke Gets In
[1:21:45] Everything Smoke Gets in every crevice
[1:21:48] it gets in every little place that isn't
[1:21:52] sealed there's smoke all around us today
[1:21:54] there's fog all around us today I'm
[1:21:56] telling you make sure everything's
[1:21:57] sealed up because if you don't it gets
[1:21:59] in and it affects your life and people
[1:22:01] can tell when you've been around the
[1:22:03] campfire because they smell the
[1:22:06] smoke keep it sealed up that way we have
[1:22:09] to walk through this world but that
[1:22:11] world ain't getting in on the inside of
[1:22:12] us yes we got to walk in it we got to
[1:22:15] live in it and we're here but I'm
[1:22:16] telling you it's not our home it ain't
[1:22:18] where we're stay in and when I get there
[1:22:20] I don't want to what's that smell what
[1:22:23] is that on you no sir I want to know
[1:22:25] when I walk through it I'm so sealed up
[1:22:27] so airtight that none of it sticks to me
[1:22:30] none of it gets on me none of it affects
[1:22:32] my life none of it affects my home
[1:22:34] because I'm living in expectation that
[1:22:36] we're leaving this place it's got to
[1:22:39] become made
[1:22:43] manifest
[1:22:46] Hallelujah you know Mary said be it unto
[1:22:49] me and we celebrate that when the angel
[1:22:52] came and promised sir but what would
[1:22:57] happen and how would we look at that if
[1:22:59] she said be it unto me Lord according to
[1:23:00] Thy word and then the baby never
[1:23:05] came what kind of story would that
[1:23:08] be what would that be if it just forever
[1:23:12] remained in the form of a
[1:23:15] promise but that's not that's not what
[1:23:17] happened because Mary Laid claim she
[1:23:20] said be it unto me and and she didn't
[1:23:22] feel anything and she didn't feel a
[1:23:23] change but she took the word and the
[1:23:26] promise was made manifest as our Lord
[1:23:28] Jesus Christ the prophet said that's the
[1:23:31] way Miracles are performed when God is
[1:23:33] took by his word The Impossibles Are
[1:23:36] Made Real the invisible becomes
[1:23:41] visible God's word's always going to
[1:23:43] become made manifest brother and you
[1:23:45] said that a lot I'm G to say it a lot
[1:23:47] more I taught middle schoolers for years
[1:23:50] my job was just to pound stuff into
[1:23:51] their head if they remembered one thing
[1:23:53] at the end day I was
[1:23:56] happy God's word's going to become made
[1:23:58] manifest because he can't lie his word
[1:24:00] is the truth he has to keep his word to
[1:24:02] be God now as we when we reach this time
[1:24:05] in history we talked about the logos
[1:24:07] Before Time and now we just brought up
[1:24:09] Mary as we reach this time of
[1:24:12] Mary to a place where God actually comes
[1:24:15] in the
[1:24:16] flesh and when he comes in the flesh
[1:24:18] once again what it is is him vindicating
[1:24:21] his
[1:24:21] word everything that had happened until
[1:24:24] now now in the scriptures and in history
[1:24:26] had pointed to this coming it had said
[1:24:29] he's coming it had pointed ahead it was
[1:24:31] a promise there was promise in scripture
[1:24:34] Time After Time the woman's seed shall
[1:24:36] bruise the Serpent's head Behold a
[1:24:38] virgin shall conceive he's going to bind
[1:24:40] up the Brokenhearted he's going to
[1:24:42] Proclaim Liberty to the captives and
[1:24:43] they were all just words that were
[1:24:45] invisible amen but there came a time
[1:24:47] that the invisible became visible and he
[1:24:49] stepped into that body and there comes a
[1:24:52] day when all the scriptures that were
[1:24:54] spoke of him every scripture every word
[1:24:57] everything in the Old Testament
[1:24:58] everything there was is fulfilled in one
[1:25:00] man Christ Jesus and what it is at this
[1:25:04] point is God has further unfolded
[1:25:06] himself from the
[1:25:08] logos he's further unfolded from logos
[1:25:11] into the man Christ Jesus and Hebrews 1
[1:25:15] tells us that he was the express image
[1:25:18] of
[1:25:19] Goden Colossians 1:15 said he was the
[1:25:22] image of the invis visible god brother
[1:25:26] Brown says and Jehovah God the logos who
[1:25:29] brewed over the Earth and brewed over
[1:25:31] the first man Out of the Dust of the
[1:25:32] earth overshadowed Mary and brooded over
[1:25:35] her to fulfill his word and created the
[1:25:38] blood cell that brought forth the son of
[1:25:40] the Living God I believe in a body he
[1:25:43] was a man I believe in his soul he was
[1:25:46] God he was God's
[1:25:49] manifestation here on the earth he says
[1:25:53] God come in the flesh Jesus Christ the
[1:25:55] logos that went out in the beginning how
[1:25:58] back in the beginning no one could see
[1:26:00] God then the logos come out then God
[1:26:03] manifested himself down in man and now
[1:26:08] Jesus begins a
[1:26:10] Ministry and this ministry makes God
[1:26:14] visible he begins a Ministry that
[1:26:16] unveils what was hidden and that that
[1:26:18] manifest the Unseen and and the
[1:26:20] invisible God is now walking around in a
[1:26:23] body upon the
[1:26:25] Earth and yet people still couldn't see
[1:26:30] it he's made visible and yet they still
[1:26:34] couldn't see it they would look right at
[1:26:36] it and couldn't receive it and as I said
[1:26:39] earlier we have to be willing to
[1:26:41] recognize fulfillment when it comes
[1:26:44] because it's not always going to come
[1:26:45] the way you expect it to
[1:26:47] come it's not always going to be exactly
[1:26:50] the way that that that you were taught
[1:26:52] it doesn't match the way maybe mama
[1:26:54] taught it the way maybe daddy taught it
[1:26:56] and or or it doesn't go in a way that
[1:26:58] makes us
[1:26:59] comfortable but fulfillment comes anyway
[1:27:02] whether or not you receive it's up to
[1:27:04] you because before it was made plain
[1:27:07] many times we get it all figured out
[1:27:09] this is how it's going to be brother
[1:27:10] Andrew and we set up these parameters
[1:27:13] within our own thinking and then we try
[1:27:14] to take the Fulfillment and stuff it
[1:27:16] within those parameters and say this is
[1:27:18] how God's going to do
[1:27:20] it this is how God's going to move and
[1:27:24] and that's exactly what happened with
[1:27:25] the religious leaders of that day in
[1:27:27] their mind it had to be a certain way it
[1:27:29] had to come to their denomination and
[1:27:31] he's going to come down like this and
[1:27:32] he's going to come to caiaphus and he's
[1:27:34] going to fight off all the Romans and
[1:27:36] it's going to be our group it had to be
[1:27:39] exactly how their Church interpreted it
[1:27:42] exactly how their Church taught it and
[1:27:44] here comes the word made
[1:27:49] flesh God unfolding himself in a further
[1:27:52] unfolding and he walks down right in
[1:27:54] their midst and because of their
[1:27:56] Traditions they couldn't see what was
[1:27:58] being made visible right in front of
[1:28:01] them because of their ideas because of
[1:28:03] their family traditions because of what
[1:28:05] Daddy taught me because of this idea
[1:28:07] that we hold on to in our family they
[1:28:09] couldn't see what was being made visible
[1:28:11] right there and even testified to John's
[1:28:14] disciples he said the blind see the lame
[1:28:17] walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf
[1:28:19] here the dead are raised the gospels
[1:28:21] preached to the
[1:28:23] poor see notice it wasn't just the
[1:28:25] invisible made visible in flesh but it
[1:28:29] was being made visible in the works that
[1:28:31] he
[1:28:33] did he brought God visible because why
[1:28:36] the works were of God he did what only
[1:28:38] God could do and in the midst of all
[1:28:41] that even though the most of people
[1:28:42] rejected him there were some whose eyes
[1:28:45] began to come open there were some who
[1:28:48] were able to recognize because some
[1:28:51] began to compare it to the word
[1:28:54] they began to look back in the
[1:28:56] scriptures and say how does this match
[1:28:59] up with what the scriptures
[1:29:01] say listen I believe if we start taking
[1:29:04] some of our questions back to the word
[1:29:06] some of our worries back to the word
[1:29:08] some of our what about this back to the
[1:29:10] word we'd have a lot more testimonies
[1:29:13] and a lot less
[1:29:15] debates there'd be a lot more less of
[1:29:17] well he said she said listen I don't
[1:29:19] care what they said what does the word
[1:29:22] say about it what does that that settles
[1:29:25] the situation every single time brother
[1:29:28] you're entitled to your opinion you're
[1:29:31] entitled to the way you see it God bless
[1:29:33] you but I'm GNA be like David when Saul
[1:29:35] tried to give him armor that's great for
[1:29:37] you but I know what works I know what
[1:29:39] brings Victory I know what brings
[1:29:41] healing I know what killed the lion I
[1:29:44] know what killed the bear I know what
[1:29:46] brought me out it's right here it's the
[1:29:49] unadulterated pure word of God and I'm
[1:29:51] going to stick to this right here
[1:29:54] [Applause]
[1:29:57] here hey you may overcome however you
[1:30:00] need to but for me in my house I'm going
[1:30:03] stick with the word of God I'mma stay
[1:30:06] right
[1:30:07] here
[1:30:09] hallelujah it's never
[1:30:13] failing he talks about the disciples
[1:30:15] there talking about how they began to
[1:30:16] read the word and he says no one can
[1:30:19] create but God God's the only Creator
[1:30:22] there is and he took five little bit
[1:30:24] biscuits and two little fishes and fed
[1:30:26] 5,000 take up seven basket fulls when
[1:30:29] nothing could do that but Jehovah the
[1:30:32] same one that rained down bread out of
[1:30:33] the Skies there's only one so they're
[1:30:36] they're looking at the word and they're
[1:30:37] comparing it says and here he is known
[1:30:41] amongst us in the humble form of a
[1:30:43] carpenter an ordinary man here is
[1:30:46] Jehovah that lived in the heavens that
[1:30:48] no one could see the invisible God is
[1:30:51] made visible here Among Us for we know
[1:30:53] him he does the same works that Jehovah
[1:30:55] did Messiah was supposed to be Jehovah
[1:30:58] Emanuel God With Us and if I don't do
[1:31:00] the works of Emanuel if I I don't act
[1:31:02] like Emanuel my works is not like emanu
[1:31:05] then I'm not Emanuel but if you can't
[1:31:08] believe me just watch The Works that I
[1:31:10] do they testify of who I am sir he was
[1:31:15] the manifestation of the invisible he
[1:31:18] was a word the word in a body doing the
[1:31:20] works of Jehovah and he's saying listen
[1:31:23] if you don't believe believe that's who
[1:31:24] I am then at least look at what I'm
[1:31:26] doing at least look at what's happening
[1:31:28] that that God is being manifested Before
[1:31:31] You by The Works it was in John 14:11 he
[1:31:34] says believe me that I'm in the father
[1:31:36] and the father in me or else believe me
[1:31:39] for the very work sake look I understand
[1:31:43] you you can't see who I am because of my
[1:31:45] birth I understand you can't see who I
[1:31:48] am because I didn't go to your school
[1:31:50] I'm not part of your church I understand
[1:31:52] that but if you can't believe me at
[1:31:55] least compare what I'm doing to the word
[1:31:57] of God compare the works that are
[1:32:00] happening to the word of God they
[1:32:02] testify of who I am they make Jehovah
[1:32:06] manifested in your very
[1:32:09] eyes and yet as blind as the religious
[1:32:11] leaders of the world were and the
[1:32:13] majority of the people there there were
[1:32:15] others who eyes just continually began
[1:32:17] to come open IA was being applied listen
[1:32:20] there's always somebody's going to catch
[1:32:21] it brother brandom said God's always
[1:32:23] always going to have somebody that he
[1:32:25] can put his finger on I'm telling you
[1:32:27] let others not be able to see it others
[1:32:29] say I can't see it somebody's going to
[1:32:31] catch it somebody's going to hear it
[1:32:34] somebody's going to look back in the
[1:32:35] word and go it's truth it's truth it
[1:32:38] lines up It lines
[1:32:41] up think about it why is it why is it
[1:32:44] that you see it so clearly you see it so
[1:32:47] plain and man sometimes you think oh
[1:32:49] I'll just tell them I'm explain to them
[1:32:51] serpent SE that that's easy you know
[1:32:52] that's a I'm going to show them baptism
[1:32:54] they just
[1:32:55] said they can't see it they think you're
[1:32:57] crazy and I'm sitting there reading it
[1:33:00] so plain as day how are they not seeing
[1:33:04] it it's more like how do you see
[1:33:08] it you Lord You're predestinated to it
[1:33:12] and it calls your name I got a simple
[1:33:15] analogy I like to use if I'm walking
[1:33:17] through the airport and I'm walking
[1:33:19] along it don't matter how important the
[1:33:21] message is coming over the loudspeaker
[1:33:23] if they're calling for Henry Cooper I
[1:33:26] just keep
[1:33:28] walking that I it may be a very
[1:33:30] important message it may be urgent but
[1:33:32] it ain't for me I don't need Henry
[1:33:35] Cooper's message and I keep walking
[1:33:38] along and they say you know John Thomas
[1:33:40] it's very important that you report it's
[1:33:42] very urgent I just keep walking it don't
[1:33:44] matter but the minute it says Aon ogles
[1:33:48] be everybody else keeps walking cuz it
[1:33:51] don't mean nothing to them but it called
[1:33:53] my name it's my message I'm going to go
[1:33:57] find out what my message said he said
[1:34:00] it's urgent I'm coming back I'm coming
[1:34:03] back get ready it's an Urgent
[1:34:06] Message and it's calling your name and
[1:34:08] you hear it and you respond cuz it's for
[1:34:12] you Hallelujah it called your that's why
[1:34:15] others don't hear it others don't see it
[1:34:18] it's calling your
[1:34:21] name Hallelujah
[1:34:25] there's always somebody that catches
[1:34:28] it because it calls their name it's not
[1:34:32] per
[1:34:33] chance it's not an
[1:34:35] accident it's it's
[1:34:38] predestination there's always somebody
[1:34:40] who recognizes the life they recognize
[1:34:43] the
[1:34:44] works because it's
[1:34:46] family you see family in the store you
[1:34:48] recognize it I know them you see God
[1:34:52] move in service and some people can't
[1:34:53] recognize it is that God you sitting
[1:34:56] there and you recognize it because
[1:34:57] you're of the same DNA you're from the
[1:35:00] same logos you recognize it because a
[1:35:03] part of you that's in you in the same
[1:35:05] thing that's in that you say that's God
[1:35:08] that's God moving in our midst we're
[1:35:10] attributes of the same Source we're
[1:35:12] going back the same
[1:35:14] place
[1:35:16] hallelujah hallelujah it's wonderful the
[1:35:18] woman sitting at the well her eyes came
[1:35:21] open she recognized what
[1:35:24] the works we
[1:35:27] know that one's coming that's going to
[1:35:29] do these things it was The Works
[1:35:32] Nathaniel saw the works and he said Thou
[1:35:34] Art the Son of God the DNA in him
[1:35:37] recognized the DNA in
[1:35:40] Jesus look at the woman who washed
[1:35:42] Jesus's feet there at the party I'm
[1:35:44] going read this to you brother Brown
[1:35:46] says look how filthy she was but
[1:35:49] something
[1:35:50] struck how many can testify to that she
[1:35:53] seen the word of the promise from the
[1:35:55] Garden of Eden This Woman's seed shall
[1:35:57] bruise the Serpent's head she seen the
[1:36:00] Messiah that had been born of a virgin
[1:36:02] she heard he was to be born of a virgin
[1:36:04] but they but they had heard the man was
[1:36:06] on the earth she heard there was a young
[1:36:08] Rabbi Prophet who healed the sick she
[1:36:10] believed that and here she come down the
[1:36:12] street walking around looking around she
[1:36:15] looked over there and seeing that great
[1:36:16] party going on she slipped up to the
[1:36:18] fence and looked through and there he
[1:36:20] was there he was and something said
[1:36:24] that's him that's how it is in a service
[1:36:27] last night when he begins to move others
[1:36:29] are like what is that what is that but
[1:36:32] those with the same DNA go that's
[1:36:35] him that's him right there she said
[1:36:38] that's him see that's all she needed to
[1:36:41] be inspired what happened she seen the
[1:36:44] word of God made flesh she heard with
[1:36:47] her ear but now she saw with her eyes
[1:36:51] and what she do in that moment she come
[1:36:53] comes down and bows down at his feet and
[1:36:55] she begins to weep and cry and worship
[1:36:58] and and she washes his feet with her
[1:37:00] tears and she dries his feet with her
[1:37:02] hair and I say that's how we all should
[1:37:04] act in his presence that's how we all
[1:37:07] should act when he comes around I'm
[1:37:09] going to give you my everything I may
[1:37:12] not have much even if it's just my tears
[1:37:14] I'm G to give you my
[1:37:15] tears and that's how we all should be
[1:37:18] free in his presence but many times
[1:37:20] we'll play the part of the
[1:37:21] Pharisee what gives her her the right to
[1:37:26] dance what gives her the right to
[1:37:28] worship like that do you not know the
[1:37:31] life she
[1:37:34] lives I'm G say something
[1:37:38] here and it's just how I feel so if if
[1:37:41] brother Andrew or somebody like to
[1:37:42] correct this that that's fine so if this
[1:37:44] is a seed in the pie just spit it
[1:37:49] out but a lot of times we'll look at
[1:37:51] somebody that's been struggling maybe
[1:37:53] they've been out in the world maybe
[1:37:55] their life ain't tip toop absolute
[1:37:58] perfection she maybe that sister ain't
[1:38:00] the one you go no there's a proverbs 31
[1:38:03] lady right there maybe that's not who
[1:38:06] she is or maybe that's not who he is
[1:38:08] however you want to say
[1:38:09] it and they get touched in a service and
[1:38:14] they get to
[1:38:15] dance and they get to shout and they get
[1:38:19] to praising God and we want to sit there
[1:38:21] and go but I know what they were doing
[1:38:25] yesterday how can that be God that's a
[1:38:27] sh well let me just take it back the way
[1:38:29] I believe
[1:38:31] it brother brandham taught very clearly
[1:38:35] he never said dancing was a sign of the
[1:38:37] Holy Ghost he said dancing was a sign of
[1:38:40] Victory now this is just a simple
[1:38:42] analogy and how I feel about it so this
[1:38:45] is just me but if somebody comes up here
[1:38:49] and they've been possessed by a hundred
[1:38:51] devils and they're ate up with with a
[1:38:53] hundred Devils they so far from the Holy
[1:38:55] Ghost and that that you can't hardly
[1:38:58] explain it but in the midst of prayer or
[1:39:01] in the midst of service one of those
[1:39:03] Devils gets
[1:39:06] crushed one of them one of them that's a
[1:39:10] victory and they got every right to
[1:39:13] dance on their Victory they got every
[1:39:17] right to praise God for that Victory I
[1:39:20] got 99 Devils but I got one left that I
[1:39:23] had a minute ago I've been set free of
[1:39:26] that Spirit now I'm going to kill
[1:39:28] another one and kill another one and
[1:39:30] I'mma dance every single
[1:39:33] time all the way to complete total
[1:39:40] Victory if they get a victory let them
[1:39:45] Rejoice let them have their victory
[1:39:48] dance
[1:39:53] why would we say well they still got so
[1:39:55] much on them instead of saying they got
[1:39:57] less than they had a while
[1:39:59] ago they're one step
[1:40:02] [Applause]
[1:40:11] closer I had a young sister come up to
[1:40:13] me one time at the front of a service
[1:40:16] very Supernatural moment and I won't go
[1:40:18] into it
[1:40:19] all but I knew she was tormented I knew
[1:40:23] a lot of the
[1:40:24] things and she came up in her opening
[1:40:27] line to me
[1:40:28] was this is the only place I don't
[1:40:34] hurt this is the only place I don't hurt
[1:40:39] and we want to take their freedom from
[1:40:41] them in
[1:40:42] here they're bound up out there they're
[1:40:45] tormented out there they're struggling
[1:40:46] out there I say in here let them be free
[1:40:49] let them be free no judgment no torment
[1:40:52] just free to pray prise a living God
[1:40:54] just let them keep coming back to the
[1:40:56] well coming back to the well freely
[1:40:58] coming back to the well and eventually
[1:41:00] they'll get the hold of the real deal
[1:41:03] they'll get a hold of it it won't just
[1:41:04] be a dance outwardly but their soul will
[1:41:07] be saved they'll be change
[1:41:13] forever just let them come back to the
[1:41:21] well we'll move on
[1:41:26] let's be like the woman because the
[1:41:29] whole time we're sitting there judging
[1:41:31] the whole time we're wondering if that
[1:41:32] is that really the spirit of God moving
[1:41:34] somebody's at his feet
[1:41:36] worshiping somebody's getting delivered
[1:41:39] somebody's getting saved all the while
[1:41:42] somebody's getting delivered and you're
[1:41:44] wondering all about your questions and
[1:41:45] your criticisms and he's being made
[1:41:47] visible right there in your
[1:41:49] midst and then you'll walk around and
[1:41:51] say I want to see God no you don't
[1:41:53] come on you want to see what you think
[1:41:56] God is
[1:42:01] manifested you want to see your
[1:42:02] preconceptions
[1:42:04] manifested just let God be
[1:42:07] God how about you worry about you and
[1:42:09] let God worry about manifesting how God
[1:42:11] wants to manifest and don't miss it when
[1:42:13] he moves recognize your opportunity in
[1:42:16] his
[1:42:19] presence recognize him when he's in our
[1:42:21] midst no God enough to know his ways
[1:42:25] speak to God enough to know his voice
[1:42:28] know him enough to recognize him when he
[1:42:30] moves spend enough time with him that
[1:42:32] he's not a foreign person when he comes
[1:42:34] through the
[1:42:36] service well I didn't see Gody you
[1:42:38] didn't recognize him because you ain't
[1:42:39] talked to him in a long
[1:42:40] time that's right look I know how it is
[1:42:44] I I love you people I don't just say
[1:42:45] that I love Full Gospel
[1:42:49] Lighthouse please don't ask me if I know
[1:42:51] your name
[1:42:56] my my wife not only she my alarm clock
[1:42:59] she's my name
[1:43:01] person I love man I see people year
[1:43:04] after year love them know them shake
[1:43:05] their hand good man I love that guy
[1:43:07] watch's
[1:43:09] now his
[1:43:16] brother sometimes you catch me reverting
[1:43:18] back to high school it's not this cuz I
[1:43:19] don't know like what's up bro
[1:43:27] because you don't talk to them every day
[1:43:29] that's right they're not part of your
[1:43:31] life every day so it's hard for you to
[1:43:33] remember their ways their voice who they
[1:43:36] are what they do for a living and it's
[1:43:38] the same way in the house of God you
[1:43:40] ain't recognizing what's going on around
[1:43:41] you because you ain't communing with him
[1:43:48] enough when he does something to make
[1:43:50] himself visible recognizes him when he
[1:43:53] heals the sick when he saves the sinner
[1:43:55] when he discerns the thoughts and
[1:43:56] repeats your conversations it ain't
[1:43:58] because somebody told
[1:44:01] it let it just be like the disciples
[1:44:04] Copus and them that went on the road to
[1:44:05] EMAs when Jesus did something that
[1:44:08] they'd seen him do before they
[1:44:10] recognized him for what it was they
[1:44:13] recognized that's him we've seen him do
[1:44:16] that before and they knew it was him and
[1:44:18] it lit a fire in them they didn't stand
[1:44:20] up and go well let's debate this could
[1:44:21] it possibly be him I'm not sure if it's
[1:44:23] him because you know he might would have
[1:44:25] maybe it would have come like this oh
[1:44:26] that they saw something and they got up
[1:44:28] and they strolled back towards Jerusalem
[1:44:30] to find their Brethren to say
[1:44:33] Brethren that's not how it is come on
[1:44:36] they saw God move and it said they ran
[1:44:39] it lit a fire they came out their Pew
[1:44:41] they were dancing they were shouting why
[1:44:43] do you do that not because somebody said
[1:44:46] something good or sing a good song
[1:44:48] because you saw him move you said that's
[1:44:50] him he's alive he's here I got got to
[1:44:53] tell somebody I got to tell
[1:44:56] somebody it's
[1:44:59] Jesus he's manifesting himself in a
[1:45:02] Sunday morning service and I see him
[1:45:05] he's moving it's the same God that was
[1:45:09] here in the 50s and 60s he's still
[1:45:13] alive Hallelujah
[1:45:23] you can choose to see what you
[1:45:25] want Pharisees saw what they wanted to
[1:45:28] see others saw a carpenter others saw a
[1:45:32] man with illegitimate birth but others
[1:45:34] saw
[1:45:36] God can we lay aside our ideas today and
[1:45:39] see
[1:45:40] God Can you lay aside our preferences
[1:45:43] and see
[1:45:44] God I say it a lot I maybe I've said it
[1:45:47] here there's nothing wrong with
[1:45:49] preferences brother
[1:45:50] Andrew it's okay if you like this song
[1:45:52] better than that that's fine this style
[1:45:55] better than this style that's fine man
[1:45:57] we're not all going to be the
[1:46:00] same my daughter was telling me the
[1:46:02] other day you used to love to jam your
[1:46:05] music and now it's like turn it down
[1:46:06] turn it down it's like it happens get
[1:46:11] ready I know a lot of you probably seen
[1:46:13] it but it's the truth I said I I'm at
[1:46:16] that age to I turn the radio down so I
[1:46:18] can see better
[1:46:27] we're not always going to get on the
[1:46:28] exact same page the problem is when we
[1:46:30] make our preferences
[1:46:34] spiritual your preference ain't no more
[1:46:36] spiritual than my preference it's what I
[1:46:39] prefer it's what you've prefer that's
[1:46:41] okay I've said before we ain't all going
[1:46:43] to be best friends we ain't all going to
[1:46:44] hang out all none of that matters we're
[1:46:47] here to see Jesus we're here to lay
[1:46:49] aside those things and see Jesus I want
[1:46:51] him to be manifest right here this
[1:46:54] morning in this service in my life in
[1:46:56] your life in your life in your life Lord
[1:46:59] Jesus make yourself manifest here
[1:47:02] today that's what it's all
[1:47:06] about
[1:47:11] Hallelujah when he moves here and people
[1:47:13] shout and people dance and people scream
[1:47:16] what do you
[1:47:18] see what do you judge it what do you
[1:47:21] call it
[1:47:23] because I choose to see God moving in
[1:47:25] the hearts of men and women and them
[1:47:27] responding just like those on the road
[1:47:29] to
[1:47:30] Emmas I love this quote right here
[1:47:32] brother brandham says I believe that the
[1:47:34] same God that fell on the day of
[1:47:35] Pentecost upon his church as a pillar of
[1:47:38] fire and divided himself with clothing
[1:47:39] tongues among his people is here tonight
[1:47:42] amen it's the same God he was then he is
[1:47:46] today with the same Holy Ghost now
[1:47:48] listen close it's a paradox it cannot be
[1:47:53] explained
[1:47:55] emotions screaming crying and so forth
[1:47:59] you put what you want and so forth
[1:48:02] flopping
[1:48:06] flapping you put whatever you want and
[1:48:08] so for screaming shouting There She Goes
[1:48:11] whatever you want to put in there he
[1:48:13] says it's a
[1:48:15] paradox he says but it's a paradox how
[1:48:18] God does it no no no no no that's not
[1:48:21] God that's sister God no it's a paradox
[1:48:24] how God does it it's the Unseen God
[1:48:27] dwelling in the human heart I'm going to
[1:48:29] reread this in case we lose it we're
[1:48:30] talking about jumping dancing screaming
[1:48:34] emotions he says it cannot be explained
[1:48:36] emotion screaming crying and so forth
[1:48:39] cannot be explained it's a paradox how
[1:48:41] God does it it's the Unseen God dwelling
[1:48:44] in the human heart making himself
[1:48:46] visible by vindicating his word that
[1:48:49] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:48:51] forever listen the next time that the
[1:48:53] Devil comes and tells you you need to be
[1:48:55] ashamed of your worship that you need to
[1:48:57] be ashamed of your dance ashamed of your
[1:48:59] scream ashamed of your cry he said your
[1:49:02] worship makes an invisible God visible
[1:49:05] what am I doing I'm manifesting Jesus in
[1:49:08] my dance I'm manifesting Jesus in my
[1:49:11] shout I'm making an invisible God
[1:49:14] visible by the way I worship I know he's
[1:49:17] here cuz I see you worshiping him I know
[1:49:20] he's here I see the effects I see God
[1:49:23] manifested in your
[1:49:26] worship it's just emotion nope I'm
[1:49:29] making God
[1:49:31] visible it's so much more than you've
[1:49:34] ever
[1:49:35] realized you make him
[1:49:38] manifest your worship makes God
[1:49:44] visible we running out of
[1:49:48] time it always makes you nervous when
[1:49:50] you say something like that and nobody
[1:49:52] says preach on
[1:49:58] brother say run out time you hear that
[1:50:01] kind like
[1:50:04] amen first amen he said all
[1:50:15] day all right few more minutes we're
[1:50:19] going to try to wrap this up
[1:50:24] feel like I almost lost y'all here we go
[1:50:26] we're going Jesus was the word of God
[1:50:28] made flesh and his ministry in that body
[1:50:32] made the invisible God visible I'm going
[1:50:34] to try to get to the cruts of this thing
[1:50:36] he was the fullness of the godhead in a
[1:50:38] body and there came a time after he
[1:50:41] finished all that he was in the groom
[1:50:42] form that he was taken up in the
[1:50:44] Ascension and he returned to what we
[1:50:47] would call
[1:50:49] invisible the body was gone but but he
[1:50:52] promised that we would still be able to
[1:50:54] see him if we turn to John 14-6 he says
[1:50:59] and I will pray the father and he shall
[1:51:00] give you another comforter that he may
[1:51:02] abide with you forever even the spirit
[1:51:04] of Truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:51:07] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[1:51:10] him but you know him for he dwelleth
[1:51:13] with you and shall be in you I will not
[1:51:15] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[1:51:17] yet a little while and the world seeth
[1:51:20] me no more but ye see me me because I
[1:51:24] live in you you shall live also and at
[1:51:26] that day you shall know that I am in the
[1:51:28] father and ye in me and I in you he that
[1:51:30] hath my Commandments and keepeth them he
[1:51:33] he he it is that loveth me he that
[1:51:35] loveth me shall be loved of my father
[1:51:37] and I will love him and will manifest
[1:51:41] myself to him the whole world's blind
[1:51:44] they can't see but you shall see him
[1:51:47] he's not invisible to us although he's
[1:51:49] still the invisible God we see him we
[1:51:53] seem him all the time we seem in the
[1:51:55] manifestation of his promises we seem in
[1:51:57] the Fulfillment of his word as that word
[1:52:00] becomes fulfilled it's visible to
[1:52:03] us and now we can say and here's what
[1:52:06] we've been trying to get to now we can
[1:52:08] say that the word being made flesh isn't
[1:52:11] just a 2,000 year ago
[1:52:14] thing it's not just the body of Jesus
[1:52:17] that's going to be a flesh body that
[1:52:19] manifests the Lord Jesus on the Earth
[1:52:21] but in our day the invisible God has
[1:52:25] been made visible once again look the
[1:52:28] logos the pillar of fire that that
[1:52:30] knocked Paul off his high horse the
[1:52:31] logos the pillar of fire that met Moses
[1:52:33] in a burning bush the pillar of fire
[1:52:36] that led the children through the
[1:52:37] Wilderness came and met one of his
[1:52:39] prophets in Houston Texas in 1950 and
[1:52:43] became visible to the world once again
[1:52:45] and in that moment it wasn't just the
[1:52:47] elect it became visible to the whole
[1:52:49] world to declare I'm back I'm here I've
[1:52:53] come in the fullness and the pillar of
[1:52:56] fire is back with the church again it's
[1:52:59] been made visible once
[1:53:01] again and once again he comes down and
[1:53:05] He makes himself visible and what is it
[1:53:06] it's an unfolding and he begins to
[1:53:09] unfold himself once again there in the
[1:53:12] groom form he was manifested to those
[1:53:14] who could receive him and then after
[1:53:17] 2,000 years he comes again in the
[1:53:19] fullness of his word through the
[1:53:21] promised message of Mal
[1:53:23] 4 which unveils him to the elect it's a
[1:53:28] further unfolding it's the invisible
[1:53:30] becoming
[1:53:32] visible the Unseen becoming manifest and
[1:53:35] the prophet said they believe though
[1:53:37] they've never broke into this yet to see
[1:53:40] that great shika light both spiritual
[1:53:42] and physical in so much that a
[1:53:44] mechanical eye of the camera keeps
[1:53:46] taking the picture just two weeks ago it
[1:53:49] caught it again you're revealing
[1:53:50] yourself Lord the might God unveiled to
[1:53:53] the believer still veiled to the
[1:53:55] unbeliever but unveiled to the believer
[1:53:59] now what was this as as Malachi 4 comes
[1:54:02] on the scene and a message BEC begins to
[1:54:04] come forth we had God in the beginning
[1:54:06] unfolded into the lust and then down
[1:54:09] through the word he unfolds and then he
[1:54:11] unfolds himself into the human body of
[1:54:13] Christ Jesus and then here we are again
[1:54:16] with another unfolding and Malachi four
[1:54:18] steps on the scene and he begins to
[1:54:20] unfold himself in what we would call the
[1:54:23] word
[1:54:24] coming and he begins to unfold the word
[1:54:27] it's the word coming of Christ and it
[1:54:29] was for the purpose that the elect might
[1:54:31] see him that all that had been hidden
[1:54:33] would be revealed and all that had been
[1:54:36] invisible would now be seen and once
[1:54:39] again many couldn't receive it even
[1:54:41] though they testified of The Works we've
[1:54:44] talked about it before the the books
[1:54:45] that we read a man sent from God Prophet
[1:54:47] visit South Africa all the different
[1:54:49] ones you could name those weren't
[1:54:51] written by message
[1:54:54] Believers there there were no message
[1:54:56] churches that's what the denominations
[1:54:59] were saying they were saying Bible days
[1:55:01] are here again they were saying this is
[1:55:04] a man sent from God this was them
[1:55:06] testifying of the works even if you
[1:55:08] don't believe I am who I say I am the
[1:55:10] works testify of who I say I am and they
[1:55:13] had to testify of the
[1:55:15] works but those that had isaf those that
[1:55:19] were of the logos word DNA from from
[1:55:22] before the foundation of the world this
[1:55:24] message made God visible to them and it
[1:55:29] brought the Unseen World into Plain View
[1:55:31] and it didn't come in word only listen
[1:55:33] this message came in powerful
[1:55:35] demonstration this message came in
[1:55:37] Victory and with healings and with
[1:55:39] Miracles and the supernatural abounded
[1:55:41] in this message our eyes didn't only
[1:55:44] hear excuse me our ears didn't only hear
[1:55:47] but our eyes saw in this day brother
[1:55:50] Brown says now you have seen his
[1:55:52] presence now your eyes have seen your
[1:55:55] ears have understood and God has
[1:55:57] confirmed before your eyes his presence
[1:56:01] that what you feel at this time that
[1:56:03] condemns you when you're wrong and tells
[1:56:06] you not to do that that same God has
[1:56:08] become visible to you here this
[1:56:10] afternoon by his
[1:56:12] works and yet that wasn't the end of the
[1:56:17] unfolding that wasn't the end of it
[1:56:19] because the word coming was to
[1:56:23] produce a bride
[1:56:25] coming the word coming wasn't for the
[1:56:28] purpose of God sending a prophet God
[1:56:30] didn't send a prophet so he could say I
[1:56:32] sent a prophet we read Malachi 4 and too
[1:56:34] many times always sees Elijah but
[1:56:37] Malachi 4 says behold I send
[1:56:39] unto you're in there just as many times
[1:56:42] as Elijah's in there this message is
[1:56:44] about you this message came to call you
[1:56:48] this message came to collect a bride to
[1:56:50] bring a you are literally the spoken
[1:56:52] word word Bride of the last day had it
[1:56:54] not spoke we wouldn't be here it spoke
[1:56:56] us into existence the word come and came
[1:57:00] to produce a bride coming a match piece
[1:57:03] for Jesus Christ who has taken the word
[1:57:05] and eaten the word and has become the
[1:57:08] word because why it's God's desire that
[1:57:12] he be manifested that his life be made
[1:57:16] manifested listen it was manifested in
[1:57:18] many different ways all down through the
[1:57:20] Old Testament and it all culminated in
[1:57:23] Jesus Christ the groom but now 2,000
[1:57:26] years later God once again in a
[1:57:31] body the prophet of God will tell us
[1:57:33] that Jesus fulfilled everything that was
[1:57:35] written of him in the Old Testament he
[1:57:37] said but his bride is going to fulfill
[1:57:40] everything that's in the New
[1:57:43] Testament what is it what are we who are
[1:57:46] we we're the ones made up of all those
[1:57:49] attributes that he thought back in the
[1:57:51] very beginning beginning I'm looking at
[1:57:53] hundreds of his attributes and just like
[1:57:56] every other attribute they were made
[1:57:58] manifest in due time listen you're not
[1:58:01] late you're not ahead of schedule you
[1:58:03] are right on time doing exactly what God
[1:58:06] called you to do standing where you're
[1:58:08] supposed to stand in the age you're
[1:58:10] supposed to be in in the church you're
[1:58:11] supposed to be in manifesting the works
[1:58:14] of Jesus Christ to a Dying World I say
[1:58:18] if you don't believe we are who we say
[1:58:20] we are then look at the Works believe
[1:58:23] the works look at the overcoming life
[1:58:25] looking at the movement of the spirit
[1:58:27] look the blind see the death hear the
[1:58:30] lame walk Cancer's healed people live
[1:58:32] overcoming lives it produces what it
[1:58:36] said it would
[1:58:38] produce
[1:58:41] hallelujah what are we doing we're
[1:58:44] making God
[1:58:46] visible we are manifesting the Unseen
[1:58:50] God we are Christ
[1:58:55] manifesting where is Christ
[1:58:58] visible where is Christ manifested and
[1:59:01] you and you and you and you and you he
[1:59:06] unfolded into the logos he unfolded into
[1:59:08] Jesus he unfolded into the fullness of
[1:59:10] the word and he
[1:59:11] unfolded into you you tabernacling the
[1:59:16] logos you manifesting Jesus you making
[1:59:20] the invisible God visible
[1:59:23] listen it's the day of manifestation
[1:59:24] brother Andrew look out in the world man
[1:59:28] the seeds are manifesting what they are
[1:59:30] there's a people walking around
[1:59:32] literally manifesting The Works of Satan
[1:59:34] to where you can literally look and see
[1:59:36] the body of Satan walking around on the
[1:59:38] earth then I say if that tree has come
[1:59:40] to its maturity there's a bride tree
[1:59:43] that's been restored and fruits are
[1:59:45] beginning to come out on their branches
[1:59:47] and if they're manifesting where they're
[1:59:49] from there's got to be another people
[1:59:51] manifested an invisible God that
[1:59:53] testifies where we're from who our King
[1:59:56] is where our home is our lord Jesus I
[1:59:59] want my life to manifest
[2:00:03] him
[2:00:05] Hallelujah the Unseen becoming manifest

[2:41:27] hallelujah what a beneficial meeting
[2:41:31] this has
[2:41:34] been I stood
[2:41:36] today and I witnessed Jesus really close
[2:41:41] am I witnessed Jesus really close
[2:41:44] because there are things that brother
[2:41:46] Aaron has no idea about that's right no
[2:41:49] way could he know and we witness the
[2:41:53] power of Jesus Christ take a man from
[2:41:55] Louisiana and allow the word of God to
[2:41:58] do what he said he would do that it
[2:42:00] would be a discerner of the thoughts and
[2:42:02] the Very intents of the heart that it
[2:42:04] would cut it would go to the mirror of
[2:42:06] the bone so I recognize that a man has
[2:42:09] yielded himself to the witness of the
[2:42:11] Holy Spirit and has benefited the Bride
[2:42:14] of Jesus Christ for the glory of the
[2:42:16] kingdom of God for that Full Gospel
[2:42:20] Lighthouse we are
[2:42:22] thankful we are thankful that a man can
[2:42:26] be so yielded that he could come right
[2:42:29] down through your ten Can Alley and the
[2:42:31] word of God could witness to you and you
[2:42:34] would see Jesus Christ the same
[2:42:36] yesterday today and forever that's right
[2:42:39] we're the Most Blessed people on the
[2:42:41] face of the planet to say that we have
[2:42:44] recognized our opportunity in his
[2:42:46] presence and we've literally watched the
[2:42:49] invisible made visible right here it's
[2:42:52] manifesting time we are in it we just
[2:42:56] want to give brother Aaron and his
[2:42:58] family a hand clap a praise aome and
[2:43:03] thanksgiving for coming by our
[2:43:06] [Music]
[2:43:11] way I love all the Dynamics of the body
[2:43:14] I love how every minister is built
[2:43:16] different how they study differently how
[2:43:18] they look at something something
[2:43:19] different and I thank God for
[2:43:21] evangelists like this that can come in
[2:43:24] and be a benefit to the body of Jesus
[2:43:27] Christ and I love how that God does
[2:43:30] those things he can take one word and
[2:43:33] just make it so personal to you to that
[2:43:35] we are a witness that Jesus is amongst
[2:43:38] us we're going to let you be dismissed
[2:43:40] today I want you to go reverently I want
[2:43:42] you to go greet one another I want you
[2:43:44] to do something for me today somebody
[2:43:47] that you don't typically go out and
[2:43:48] shake their hand I want you to go out of
[2:43:50] your way and I want you to shake their
[2:43:51] hand I want you to make them feel
[2:43:52] welcome let them know that you love them
