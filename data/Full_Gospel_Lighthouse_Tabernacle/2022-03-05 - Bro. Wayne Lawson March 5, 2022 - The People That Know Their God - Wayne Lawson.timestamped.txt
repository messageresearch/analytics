[49:22] father in jesus mighty name we pray
[49:25] amen
[49:26] and amen and god bless you tonight and
[49:29] if you have your bibles we would like to
[49:31] turn into the word of the lord and i
[49:33] would look into the book of daniel uh if
[49:36] you can give me a little bit on the ear
[49:38] monitoring i'll turn it up as as i uh
[49:41] as i go in daniel the 11th chapter
[49:45] and uh i appreciate you keeping
[49:47] something on these down here i'm only
[49:48] wearing one of these as well so daniel
[49:50] 11 and 32
[49:53] uh i want to look at this tonight
[49:56] i've been studying out of this portion
[49:58] of daniel for a little while uh but uh
[50:01] god's gave me a little bit of
[50:03] inspiration to build on it and i just
[50:05] wanted to maybe speak to you a little
[50:06] bit tonight from my heart
[50:08] concerning uh some things here and
[50:10] daniel verse 11 and 32
[50:14] i believe it's a powerful scripture
[50:17] and it's amazing to me that these things
[50:19] were written hundreds of years before
[50:21] christ but they're talking about you
[50:25] you if you haven't read your name in the
[50:27] scripture lately
[50:28] we're about to read your name here
[50:31] uh and such as do wickedly against the
[50:33] covenant shall be
[50:35] corrupt by flatteries
[50:37] but the people can you say that with me
[50:39] the people
[50:41] that do know their god
[50:44] shall be strong
[50:46] and do exploits
[50:49] amen we ask the lord to bless his word
[50:51] as you could be seated tonight
[50:54] the people
[50:56] that do know their god
[50:58] i'd like to speak to you a little bit
[51:00] tonight from this
[51:01] the people
[51:03] that know their god
[51:05] the people
[51:06] that know their god
[51:09] to say the people that know their god
[51:11] would be a very
[51:13] broad statement it would be speaking of
[51:15] could be pretty much anybody to say the
[51:18] people
[51:19] but we realize that scripture
[51:21] sometimes gives something in a broad
[51:23] aspect and then later it's brought into
[51:26] a more precise meaning and you find out
[51:29] say say the woman's seed in the book of
[51:31] genesis turns out to be the abraham seed
[51:34] as well and then it turns out to be
[51:36] jesus christ so you can see sometimes
[51:39] something is said and seemed like a
[51:40] broad manner and many people could fit
[51:42] it but then it actually belongs to
[51:45] somebody now if you like to study this
[51:47] uh there's a lot of people trying to be
[51:49] the people of god they're trying to be
[51:51] that people amen but i believe that god
[51:54] had somebody on his mind when he said
[51:57] the people uh there is somebody he was
[52:00] thinking about there was a people uh
[52:03] when you look in the book of hosea the
[52:05] first chapter in the 10th verse there's
[52:07] a there's a place here uh where hosea as
[52:10] uh he's talking about as the children
[52:12] are being born and the bible said yet
[52:14] the number of the children of israel
[52:15] sabi is the sand of the sea which cannot
[52:18] be measured or numbered and it shall
[52:20] come to pass that in the place where it
[52:23] is said unto them
[52:25] ye are not my people
[52:27] there it shall be said unto them ye are
[52:29] the sons of the living god now prophecy
[52:33] now is being built to tell us that a
[52:36] people who are not a people
[52:38] shall be called the people of god
[52:40] now when you hear hosea say that of
[52:43] course he says the sons of the living
[52:45] god how many knows brother branham
[52:47] he actually separates
[52:49] servants as being israel and sons as
[52:51] being gentile so the sons and daughters
[52:54] of god so now we know the people he's
[52:56] talking about is going to be a gentile
[52:58] people when you go to the book of first
[53:01] peter the second chapter it's when peter
[53:03] says ye are a chosen generation
[53:07] a royal priesthood a holy nation a
[53:11] peculiar people that you should show
[53:13] forth the praises of him who called you
[53:15] out of darkness in the marvelous light
[53:17] now watch what he says a chosen
[53:19] generation a royal priesthood now this
[53:21] is what is said in the book of
[53:23] revelations the first chapter amen when
[53:25] the bible says that we are both kings
[53:28] and priests but now he puts them
[53:31] together and calls you a royal
[53:33] priesthood a peculiar nation now in in
[53:37] the next verse he'll say which in times
[53:39] past were not a people but now are the
[53:42] people of god which had not obtained
[53:45] mercy but now have obtained mercy amen
[53:49] now this is apostle peter now applying
[53:51] this to the gentile church which has
[53:54] been elevated from darkness to light and
[53:56] has been brought into a royal priesthood
[53:59] through christ now of course in romans
[54:02] the 9th chapter
[54:03] paul is describing the same verse of
[54:05] scripture and he said that he might make
[54:08] known the riches of glory on the vessels
[54:09] of mercy which had for prepared unto
[54:12] glory even to us who am it called not of
[54:15] the jews only but also of the gentiles
[54:19] as saith in hosea i will call them my
[54:22] people which were not my people
[54:24] and her beloved which was not beloved
[54:26] and it shall come to pass in the place
[54:28] where it is said unto them you're not my
[54:31] people they shall be called the children
[54:34] of the living god so paul then brings
[54:36] that to the jew gentiles as well so here
[54:40] hosea makes a statement according to
[54:42] daniel those people will also know their
[54:45] god and will do exploits but in
[54:47] revelations 18 john's going to narrow
[54:50] the section and he's going to say i
[54:52] heard a voice saying come out of her
[54:55] my people
[54:56] and be not partakers ever seeing that
[54:59] you receive not her plagues so apostle
[55:01] peter and paul makes it that it's the
[55:03] gentile people but here now john is
[55:06] going to show you that it's the called
[55:08] out people who are called out of the
[55:11] abominations in the last day in
[55:13] revelations the 18th chapter now it's a
[55:16] beautiful thing because this is what is
[55:18] told a prophet when it goes beyond the
[55:19] curtain of time and he sees millions of
[55:22] people coming to him and he said have
[55:24] you ever heard it said that you are
[55:26] gathered with your people and he said is
[55:28] all of these branhams he said no these
[55:30] are your converts amen and and to think
[55:33] now that the people that is in the book
[55:36] of daniel the 11th chapter is the self
[55:39] sanctuary people that is called out in
[55:42] the laodicean age which have become the
[55:45] converts of the message of the hour to
[55:48] think hey man many people say well you
[55:49] people make yourself a special group of
[55:52] people and i beg to differ we have not
[55:54] made ourselves anything amen but it's
[55:56] god that have made us what we are
[55:58] tonight we are what we are by the grace
[56:00] of god we are not making ourselves of a
[56:03] reputation but if our name is written in
[56:05] the scripture we got a right to read the
[56:07] bible we got to write to read what the
[56:10] scripture says about us tonight and i
[56:12] believe tonight is the sons and
[56:14] daughters of god that if the bible's got
[56:16] your name in it you've got to write
[56:18] everything the scripture says according
[56:20] to what you are i believe that i believe
[56:23] this is a generation amen i believe this
[56:25] is a joshua generation we've had a
[56:28] joshua among us amen that gave us our
[56:31] positions in the scripture and here's a
[56:34] prophet now identifying this
[56:36] disbelievers these people with what
[56:39] daniel wrote in daniel the 11th chapter
[56:42] now according to the bible these are a
[56:44] people and these people shall know their
[56:46] god according to ephesians chapter 1
[56:48] paul said this that the god of our lord
[56:51] jesus christ the father of glory may he
[56:53] give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[56:55] revelation in the knowledge of him
[56:58] in the knowledge of him may god give
[57:01] this people revelation in the knowledge
[57:04] of him the prophecy over you is that
[57:07] you're going to know god the prophecy
[57:09] concerning you is there will be a people
[57:13] that will know their god i'll tell you
[57:15] this you'll only know him if he shows
[57:16] himself to you you'll only know him if
[57:19] you're living in the age of revelation
[57:21] but we are standing in the season of the
[57:24] divine revealer who reveals himself to
[57:27] the church of the living god amen to
[57:30] think this that amen david that paul
[57:32] would say this amen that we would
[57:34] receive unto him the wisdom and
[57:36] revelation of him the eyes of
[57:38] understanding being enlightened that you
[57:40] may know look at that again that you may
[57:43] know what is the hope of his calling and
[57:46] what is the riches of the glory of the
[57:48] inheritance of his saints now now when i
[57:51] think about this tonight i think it's a
[57:53] powerful thing to know amen that god
[57:56] wants you to know
[57:58] that god wants you to know he wants you
[58:00] to know him god is desiring to be known
[58:04] that was the entire purpose of what
[58:06] happened in the garden of eden was that
[58:09] somebody would know him and you think
[58:11] about there was imperfection there was
[58:13] an eden but brother ram said god had a
[58:15] purpose in them leaving eden now all the
[58:17] denominations will preach to you a
[58:19] purpose-driven life and they'll say god
[58:21] has a purpose but here a prophet tells
[58:24] us what the threefold purpose of god was
[58:26] and it came to the fact that god wanted
[58:28] to be known he wants to be known as a
[58:31] healer he wants to be known as a savior
[58:34] he wants to be known as a deliverer god
[58:36] wants somebody to know him in the aspect
[58:39] of more than what he just says to them
[58:41] that he is but they would know him by
[58:44] revelation amen i'll tell you this god
[58:47] wants us to know him and when he makes
[58:49] himself known unto us that's why paul
[58:51] said that we should ask for
[58:52] understanding brother random said we
[58:54] should pray for revelation more than we
[58:57] pray for anything else because
[58:58] revelation gives us understanding of who
[59:01] god is and as our understanding
[59:03] increases our boldness increases our
[59:07] holy ghost boldness increases as we
[59:09] understand the god that we serve then
[59:11] there's a boldness that comes into our
[59:13] life and the things that are impossible
[59:16] starts becoming possible the things that
[59:18] are unseen starts becoming seeing you
[59:21] begin to move from glory to glory you
[59:24] begin to move into the exploits of the
[59:26] spirit of god as you know him beyond the
[59:29] current measure of your knowing him
[59:31] listen however you know him tonight god
[59:34] is intending that you would know him in
[59:36] a greater way
[59:37] than any other age since the time of the
[59:40] garden of eden there is a people that
[59:42] shall know their god amen do you know
[59:44] god could have released these at any age
[59:46] god could have let go of the seals he
[59:48] could have let go of the word at any age
[59:51] but you know why he didn't brother
[59:52] branham said he was waiting for a people
[59:54] to comprehend it he was waiting for
[59:56] somebody to understand it that's why you
[59:59] don't set a three-year-old down and tell
[1:00:00] them how to build a house they don't
[1:00:02] know how to that you could tell them all
[1:00:04] day long the master could reveal it but
[1:00:06] the understanding isn't there but there
[1:00:08] was coming of people and god was
[1:00:11] prophesying of a people that was going
[1:00:13] to understand their god and it was going
[1:00:15] to lift them up into measure above amen
[1:00:19] the understanding of other ages not in
[1:00:22] understanding just of knowledge amen but
[1:00:24] in the understanding of a relationship
[1:00:27] with a living and a merciful god we will
[1:00:30] know him i think of how that brother
[1:00:32] adam says it in the paradox we will know
[1:00:35] him and he said we won't have the
[1:00:36] identity of being smart men he said i
[1:00:39] don't even want to be a smart man he
[1:00:42] said i want to know him
[1:00:44] as paul said in the power of his
[1:00:46] resurrection when he calls us to come
[1:00:48] out from the dead that's all i want i
[1:00:50] want to know him amen isn't it something
[1:00:53] he says here in service that we would
[1:00:55] see jesus
[1:00:56] he says the cry of the world today is to
[1:00:58] know christ and i believe paul said to
[1:01:00] know christ as life and he knew him in
[1:01:03] the power of his resurrection not to
[1:01:05] knowing by the word now to know him see
[1:01:08] to him by the word that's all right but
[1:01:11] it's a long ways from being sufficient
[1:01:14] to know him by the word but we've got to
[1:01:16] know him by the person of his
[1:01:18] resurrection we've got to know him
[1:01:20] greater than just what we've read about
[1:01:22] him we've got to know him do you know
[1:01:25] that brother random says that a man
[1:01:26] cannot call jesus the christ except by
[1:01:29] the holy ghost
[1:01:30] he said you can say what the preacher
[1:01:32] said if the preacher said he's the lord
[1:01:34] you can say that and you can say what
[1:01:37] the teacher said or you can say what
[1:01:38] your mama said but before you can say
[1:01:41] that he's lord you're gonna have to
[1:01:43] receive jesus christ and which brings
[1:01:45] you the proof of the resurrection of
[1:01:48] almighty god i'll tell you tonight i
[1:01:50] believe i believe that it's it's a long
[1:01:52] ways from being sufficient just to be
[1:01:54] able to say that we know the word we've
[1:01:57] got to know him in the power of his
[1:01:59] resurrection
[1:02:01] in the message of the you must be born
[1:02:03] again brother adam said a true word
[1:02:05] comes to a true prophet and you'll
[1:02:07] follow a true word and get a true
[1:02:10] experience of that word because the word
[1:02:13] becomes flesh in you and you become
[1:02:15] god's son
[1:02:16] and the word of god is revolving right
[1:02:20] out of god into you
[1:02:22] because you are his nature his spirit is
[1:02:25] in you and you'll do his works so if
[1:02:28] you're following a prophet a true
[1:02:30] prophet you become to have a true
[1:02:32] experience with god and that that is
[1:02:35] that god's word will live right out of
[1:02:38] you you know that we're offered an
[1:02:40] experience in this age an experience
[1:02:42] with a living god in the message of a
[1:02:44] shame brother madam said see he said
[1:02:46] somebody will say they're a christian he
[1:02:48] said and it's a very popular thing to
[1:02:50] say now i'm a christian he said but do
[1:02:53] you believe the word of god when it said
[1:02:55] these signs shall follow them that
[1:02:56] believe
[1:02:57] he said even ministers faces will begin
[1:03:00] to blush he says see are you ashamed to
[1:03:03] say of divine healing are you ashamed of
[1:03:06] the full gospel are you ashamed of a
[1:03:09] pentecostal experience he said that's
[1:03:11] being ashamed of the word because that's
[1:03:14] the word made flesh in you
[1:03:16] a pentecostal experience is a true
[1:03:19] experience with a living god we can say
[1:03:22] that god is alive but until he makes
[1:03:25] himself known to us in the way of a
[1:03:28] pentecostal experience we do not know
[1:03:31] him in the fullness of his power god has
[1:03:33] one way to prove his resurrection how
[1:03:36] many knows that brother graham said
[1:03:37] science is not going to prove the
[1:03:38] resurrection it can't do it education
[1:03:41] can't prove the resurrection but there's
[1:03:43] one thing that can prove the
[1:03:44] resurrection and that is a pentecostal
[1:03:46] experience amen we are not pentecostal
[1:03:49] by denomination we are not pentecostal
[1:03:51] by doctrine but we are pentecostal by
[1:03:54] the experience of a living god because
[1:03:56] we believe that jesus is not in a tomb
[1:03:59] tonight but he raised up from the dead
[1:04:01] and his body sits in heaven tonight his
[1:04:04] spirit is coming to the church and here
[1:04:06] we are tonight and we can say he's alive
[1:04:09] not just because there's an empty tomb
[1:04:12] but because he's alive in this church
[1:04:14] he's alive in your worship he's alive in
[1:04:17] your songs he's alive and you're praised
[1:04:20] he's alive in your prayer he's alive in
[1:04:23] the ministry amen my god is not dead my
[1:04:27] god is alive i know him in the power of
[1:04:31] his living being tonight
[1:04:34] yes sir this is not a dead god this is
[1:04:37] not just a theological god this is not
[1:04:39] just the god of your moms and your dads
[1:04:42] and the former days this is a god who
[1:04:44] said i am that i am
[1:04:46] he is a god amen and i know now people
[1:04:49] say to me all the time i mean this this
[1:04:52] far along in the message they'll say to
[1:04:54] me brother wayne do you think it's
[1:04:55] necessary
[1:04:56] for us to be preaching on experiences at
[1:04:58] this point
[1:05:00] do you think it's necessary i think it's
[1:05:02] more necessary now than it was 20 years
[1:05:04] ago
[1:05:05] i think it's more necessary right now
[1:05:08] because what is happening in the world
[1:05:10] we're living in the only escape is god
[1:05:13] amen that's the only boat going out is
[1:05:16] god and you've got to meet god in a
[1:05:18] reality now some people say to me so
[1:05:21] brother wayne if you you you start
[1:05:22] preaching on that experience stuff
[1:05:24] you're that's that's that's a bunch of
[1:05:25] chickens you know well let me read
[1:05:27] something brother branham has to say
[1:05:28] eagle stereotypes in 1960 he said we
[1:05:31] need as ministers to preach the gospel
[1:05:34] and bring the church back to pentecost
[1:05:36] again
[1:05:37] isn't that something that people will
[1:05:39] say
[1:05:40] ministries will say we don't need that
[1:05:42] kind of preaching but a prophet said
[1:05:45] what we need to as ministers is to
[1:05:47] preach the gospel and bring the people
[1:05:50] back to pentecost he's not talking about
[1:05:52] azusa street he's talking about on the
[1:05:55] day of pentecost when the holy ghost
[1:05:57] came amen that's not a figment of
[1:05:59] imagination that's not some emotion that
[1:06:02] you make fun of that's an experience
[1:06:04] with a living god that comes down to the
[1:06:06] church and changes the being that's what
[1:06:09] it is amen brother branham said we need
[1:06:12] that kind of preaching he said we need
[1:06:14] to bring it back to an eagle experience
[1:06:18] you put that on your on your
[1:06:19] refrigerator and eagle experience is a
[1:06:22] pentecostal experience amen now now
[1:06:25] here's another one everybody said well
[1:06:27] by the way we're in the weed age now and
[1:06:29] we don't want the shuck of pentecost
[1:06:30] what's odd because brother branham don't
[1:06:32] call it shuck he calls it wheat
[1:06:35] the the zeus of pentecost was the shock
[1:06:38] is that right but it's the weed age now
[1:06:41] amen there's a ministry on the earth
[1:06:43] just like the one that went into the
[1:06:45] ground under a real pentecostal
[1:06:47] experience
[1:06:49] a weak experience an eagle experience is
[1:06:52] a real true pentecostal experience hey
[1:06:55] man you said well brother wayne you went
[1:06:56] back pentecost i always was pentecost
[1:06:59] amen i always was amen i've always been
[1:07:02] i believe a prophet taught us amen that
[1:07:04] we've got one going over here on
[1:07:06] fundamentals and we got others going out
[1:07:08] on fanatics he said but what we need is
[1:07:10] a church of the living god that can
[1:07:12] bring the two together where the word of
[1:07:14] god can be preached in its power and
[1:07:17] this manifestation i've heard people say
[1:07:19] to me well that's just a bunch of
[1:07:20] pentecostalism well i'll tell you why
[1:07:22] why don't you take this message and
[1:07:24] preach in a pentecostal church one time
[1:07:26] i tell you they'll be shouting and
[1:07:28] dancing on the singing but preach on the
[1:07:30] godhead and it'll quieten it down but
[1:07:32] not in the church here not in this
[1:07:35] assembly you preach on the power of the
[1:07:37] godhead and it'll bring a revival
[1:07:40] because this revival is not done by
[1:07:42] music it's not a singing revival this
[1:07:46] revival comes from the revealed word
[1:07:49] that's coming to the age we're in oh
[1:07:51] it'll quieten the pentecostals down but
[1:07:53] not here not full gospel lighthouse it
[1:07:56] don't quieten it down people get out of
[1:07:58] their chairs and begin to praise god and
[1:08:00] worship god amen it's not a pentecostal
[1:08:04] shuck it's the weed age it's a bride
[1:08:07] who's went back to the word of god
[1:08:11] oh yeah
[1:08:12] yeah i'll tell you what happened people
[1:08:14] have put a wet blanket on this word and
[1:08:16] they put out the experience of the word
[1:08:18] so they're preaching a word without an
[1:08:20] experience well you know what that is
[1:08:22] honestly you know what that is the word
[1:08:24] without experience is actually a painted
[1:08:27] fire
[1:08:29] that's all they've done is painted the
[1:08:30] fire they amen now this is sad to me
[1:08:33] while they're painting a fire of what it
[1:08:36] used to be like they're putting out the
[1:08:38] one that's now in
[1:08:41] they are they are exhibiting and talking
[1:08:43] about what happened in paul's day and
[1:08:45] what happened in brother branham's day
[1:08:47] but at the same moment we'll not allow
[1:08:50] the atmosphere to get to a place that
[1:08:53] the dynamics of god can take place in
[1:08:56] the church of god amen but i don't
[1:08:57] believe we need a painted fire tonight
[1:09:00] what i believe we need is the power of
[1:09:03] the holy ghost to fall in the church of
[1:09:05] the living god that this generation that
[1:09:08] is alive now will know what it's like to
[1:09:11] come face to face with a pillar of fire
[1:09:14] the angel of the mighty god
[1:09:16] i believe that's where we're at now i
[1:09:18] believe that god has a people
[1:09:21] a people
[1:09:22] that shall know their god
[1:09:24] oh my
[1:09:26] what is it i believe they shall know
[1:09:27] their god now it's odd to me the way
[1:09:29] brother branham says it and i just got
[1:09:31] to get to this quote before i continue
[1:09:33] but in daniel the 11th chapter it said
[1:09:36] of people shall know their god i'm going
[1:09:37] to read this from the feast of the
[1:09:38] trumpets brother brahms said the people
[1:09:40] that believe in him
[1:09:41] know it unless they're constantly in the
[1:09:43] word see
[1:09:45] he said how will they know how would
[1:09:46] they know the messiah unless they're in
[1:09:48] the word
[1:09:49] he said the wise shall know
[1:09:51] but the foolish and the unlives wouldn't
[1:09:53] know
[1:09:54] they shall know their god
[1:09:56] now he shall appear in the last days to
[1:10:00] bring the people back to the word so the
[1:10:02] bride will know her husband
[1:10:06] hey man i'll tell you what just take
[1:10:08] that section where it says the people
[1:10:10] shall know their god and put this in
[1:10:13] right on top of it the bride will know
[1:10:15] her mate
[1:10:17] the bride will know her husband the
[1:10:19] people of daniel 11 is the bride today
[1:10:23] amen it's not a different people you are
[1:10:26] not somebody like what god was talking
[1:10:28] about you are the people that god was
[1:10:31] talking about the bride will know their
[1:10:34] mate do you see what's in a season to
[1:10:37] know him
[1:10:39] when you when you look in the scripture
[1:10:41] amen you can go back to the book of
[1:10:43] genesis and you can go in the 18th
[1:10:45] chapter of genesis i think it's a one of
[1:10:47] the most tremendous moments in the life
[1:10:49] of abraham when elohim comes in genesis
[1:10:53] 18 and the bible said that three men
[1:10:56] come remember and as they begin to come
[1:10:58] amen abraham saw them coming and he went
[1:11:02] to the tent door and opened the door and
[1:11:05] sat down in the tent door and waited for
[1:11:07] them to approach
[1:11:09] and when he saw them coming the bible
[1:11:11] said he bowed his self to them and said
[1:11:16] my lords and my lord he said my lord
[1:11:19] amen if you would if you would allow me
[1:11:21] amen there it is i have found favor in
[1:11:24] thy sight pass not away i pray thee from
[1:11:27] thy servant continue in that next one
[1:11:29] let a little water i pray you be fetched
[1:11:32] wash your feet and rest yourselves under
[1:11:34] the tree the next verse and i will fetch
[1:11:36] a morsel of bread and comfort your
[1:11:38] hearts after that you shall pass on
[1:11:39] therefore you are come to your servant
[1:11:42] and they said so do as thou has said
[1:11:44] look at this after that you shall pass
[1:11:47] on for therefore ye are come to your
[1:11:50] servants amen brother ram said for this
[1:11:52] cause you have come to abraham the man
[1:11:55] said what was it he said he was going to
[1:11:58] let abraham be his servant he was going
[1:12:01] to let abraham wash his feet he was
[1:12:03] going to let abraham bring meat and
[1:12:05] bread he was going to allow it and of
[1:12:08] course when i started looking at this i
[1:12:10] thought dear god what kind of what kind
[1:12:12] of grace was it that the god of all
[1:12:14] creation would come down to the front of
[1:12:17] abraham's tent and sit down and
[1:12:20] fellowship with him a while you know
[1:12:22] when he visited him abraham did not
[1:12:25] hurry that situation you know what he
[1:12:26] did he meant he said to sarah sarah quit
[1:12:29] now quick now go go go need some bread
[1:12:32] he said to one of the young people go
[1:12:34] get some meat now and begin to cook the
[1:12:36] calf and and he started going over and
[1:12:38] getting a pail of water and put his feet
[1:12:40] in a pile of water now all those are
[1:12:42] symbologies you know but look at what
[1:12:44] he's going to do he's going to entertain
[1:12:47] that angel because he wants the presence
[1:12:50] of that angel in his house do you know
[1:12:54] the one that he's washing his feet is
[1:12:57] the one that's about to change his body
[1:12:59] the one he's washing his feet is the one
[1:13:02] that's there with the promise that he
[1:13:05] needs to hold on to he don't need it
[1:13:07] just to pass by he don't need the angel
[1:13:09] just to come and just to leave but he
[1:13:12] wants to do something to entertain the
[1:13:14] presence of that angel that he'll sit
[1:13:17] down and he'll stay a little while he
[1:13:19] said brother wayne what do we do do you
[1:13:21] remember washing feet you remember
[1:13:23] brother brown said that little woman
[1:13:24] went and washed jesus's feet you know
[1:13:26] what he said it was he said that was
[1:13:28] washing the dust off his feet but it was
[1:13:31] cleaning up his reputation among the
[1:13:34] people in other words when he washed the
[1:13:36] feet of jesus that little woman was
[1:13:38] saying to everybody in the room i
[1:13:40] believe this is god i believe this is a
[1:13:43] prophet i believe it's the fulfillment
[1:13:45] of the scripture
[1:13:46] them other men couldn't wash his feet
[1:13:48] because they couldn't identify with him
[1:13:51] they would lose their reputation well
[1:13:54] let me tell you i'm not interested in a
[1:13:56] reputation amen i'm interested in
[1:13:58] washing the feet of elohim that when he
[1:14:01] comes down in the church and i could
[1:14:03] pull up a bucket of water and begin to
[1:14:06] wash his feet
[1:14:09] glory to god
[1:14:10] [Applause]
[1:14:12] we're living in a generation
[1:14:14] you can have a prayer line now and when
[1:14:16] you lay your hand don't ask me why it
[1:14:18] happens but sometimes there's enough
[1:14:20] anointing that within just a human hand
[1:14:23] and a person cannot stand on their feet
[1:14:25] i don't know why but sometimes a human
[1:14:28] body cannot even contain the power that
[1:14:31] comes through a prayer of a human being
[1:14:34] it's god's way sometimes i've seen
[1:14:36] little young people i've seen sisters
[1:14:39] i've seen elders i've just seen them lay
[1:14:41] right out in the floor and there's no
[1:14:42] critics sitting back here saying well
[1:14:44] there ain't nothing to that and i tell
[1:14:46] you this ain't this and this thing but
[1:14:47] then you watch there are a few a few
[1:14:49] sisters there'll be a few brothers in
[1:14:51] that congregation it'll get up out of
[1:14:53] their chair and they'll go up to the
[1:14:55] front and they'll begin to pray with
[1:14:57] them young people what are they doing
[1:14:59] they're washing it up they're saying
[1:15:01] this is of god this is god moving among
[1:15:04] us this is the presence of god among us
[1:15:06] and what we need tonight is when we see
[1:15:09] the spirit of god moving in the church
[1:15:11] we don't want to criticize we want to
[1:15:14] wash the feet of it and say god we want
[1:15:16] this in our church
[1:15:18] we want shouting in our church we want
[1:15:21] the blessing of the holy ghost in our
[1:15:23] church
[1:15:25] hey to worship god is not just to the
[1:15:28] young people to worship god it's not
[1:15:30] just to the sisters but some of you
[1:15:33] aristocatic brothers need to break out
[1:15:36] of that shell that you let get on you
[1:15:38] and begin to worship god until the
[1:15:41] presence of elohim comes into the church
[1:15:44] and stays a little while
[1:15:45] [Applause]
[1:15:48] abraham was the captain of the house
[1:15:50] abraham was the captain he didn't let
[1:15:52] the servants do it brother he said bring
[1:15:54] me the water
[1:15:56] i'll clean it up
[1:15:57] i'll preach a message on the power of
[1:15:59] the holy ghost i'll preach the message
[1:16:02] of the hour on god and bean and skin you
[1:16:04] see what he was doing he was cleaning it
[1:16:06] up
[1:16:08] listen it was dusty it was old it was
[1:16:10] tired but by the time abraham got water
[1:16:13] and began to feed water he began to
[1:16:16] water the presence of god in his midst
[1:16:19] he began to feed it he put mead into it
[1:16:22] do you see that that's why the angel
[1:16:24] comes by here because you refresh him in
[1:16:27] your presence it's a welcoming presence
[1:16:30] i'll tell you what right there true word
[1:16:32] tabernacle amen the last couple of days
[1:16:34] the holy ghost amen the services that
[1:16:36] great anointing has been right there
[1:16:38] i'll tell you why because the welcome
[1:16:41] has come for that kind of move of god if
[1:16:44] you don't want that kind of move in your
[1:16:45] church don't worry it won't come but if
[1:16:48] you really want god to come by your way
[1:16:51] for this cause i have come to this place
[1:16:55] that the anointing of god might move in
[1:16:57] the church
[1:17:03] hello him
[1:17:06] elohim has come down and to dwell with
[1:17:09] us he's walked the aisles of this bill
[1:17:11] somebody said why ron spencer's church
[1:17:14] why in jerusalem wild food gospel why
[1:17:17] out of all the churches in this place
[1:17:19] all these little areas and all these did
[1:17:21] not why does it happen here it's because
[1:17:24] there's a tent door been opened
[1:17:27] there's some meat laying on the table
[1:17:30] there's water been drawn to wash the
[1:17:32] feet there's a fresh drink a pentecostal
[1:17:35] water for the power of the holy ghost
[1:17:38] i'll tell you if he's graceful enough to
[1:17:40] come by
[1:17:41] [Applause]
[1:17:44] oh we will refresh him in the presence
[1:17:46] of god what is it it's a people that
[1:17:49] welcomed god
[1:17:52] they cleaned him up
[1:17:56] you know that was a time i need a little
[1:17:58] water brother that was a time
[1:18:01] it was a time when that the pentecostal
[1:18:03] movement
[1:18:05] amen would have been for some people
[1:18:10] but all of a sudden he gets a bad name
[1:18:13] and people don't want to be identified
[1:18:14] with that
[1:18:19] but me
[1:18:20] i want to be identifiable him
[1:18:25] oh my
[1:18:26] do you see the visitation they were in
[1:18:29] was elohim now
[1:18:31] come down and sit with them
[1:18:33] and they were entertaining him
[1:18:35] he hung around now for a little while
[1:18:38] he'd been he'd been attending the
[1:18:40] fellowships with them
[1:18:41] he'd been receiving worship he had been
[1:18:45] think about this he's allowing abraham
[1:18:47] to worship him
[1:18:50] abraham has left over there in babylon
[1:18:53] because they got a bunch of gods
[1:18:55] and he's bowing to this one
[1:18:58] who is this man he's not just a man it's
[1:19:00] god in the man
[1:19:02] god had come down to them and he's
[1:19:04] worshipping there genesis 18 is a
[1:19:07] representative
[1:19:09] of what we are doing in this age
[1:19:11] the visitation of the great elohim has
[1:19:14] come down into this age and gave grace
[1:19:16] now brother branham says in the message
[1:19:18] anything too hard for the lord
[1:19:20] he sets and talks about when abraham was
[1:19:22] sitting in the tent door and he said it
[1:19:24] was a hot day
[1:19:26] he said sarah had been fussing about
[1:19:29] some of the fashions and how she didn't
[1:19:31] have certain things and brother man said
[1:19:33] the cattle
[1:19:34] wasn't getting the water they needed and
[1:19:36] the desert had become dry and the little
[1:19:39] water holes that began to dry up he said
[1:19:41] conditions were horrible
[1:19:43] he said see but that's what happens just
[1:19:45] before the blessing of god that's what
[1:19:48] happens just before a real move of the
[1:19:51] spirit is the conditions start getting
[1:19:53] horrible situations start rising up
[1:19:56] problems start happening everywhere but
[1:19:58] what is it it's only the devil trying to
[1:20:01] block the blessing for getting to the
[1:20:03] church listen what he'll do hey man
[1:20:05] you'll have a little situation rise up a
[1:20:07] little a little situation just before
[1:20:09] meetings really hey man they get really
[1:20:11] hot usually and situations start popping
[1:20:13] up in the church all kinds of problems
[1:20:16] and all of a sudden you'll ask yourself
[1:20:19] did i do something wrong brother man
[1:20:20] said if the devil can get you to
[1:20:22] thinking that you've done something to
[1:20:24] cause that he said he'll block your
[1:20:26] blessing right there
[1:20:29] he'll block your blessing right there
[1:20:31] but what you want to do is just remember
[1:20:33] that it's the season you're living in
[1:20:36] if it's hot outside and it's july you
[1:20:39] didn't cause it it's july it's hot
[1:20:41] outside you're used to it being hot this
[1:20:45] is laodicea
[1:20:48] get used to it it's dark everywhere
[1:20:51] troubles are everywhere but we are not
[1:20:54] camping in the odyssea we are pulled
[1:20:57] back into the presence of god where the
[1:21:00] anointing can come we still have to
[1:21:02] mingle we still have people around us
[1:21:05] amen but it's the devil trying to block
[1:21:08] the blessing
[1:21:10] now think of this what is it it's
[1:21:12] because it's like an ash heap that
[1:21:15] you're sitting on as abraham was sitting
[1:21:17] there in those conditions just before
[1:21:19] elohim comes brother madam
[1:21:22] brother baptize it and says of course
[1:21:24] amen of course what it is is the devil
[1:21:26] trying to block
[1:21:28] now if you know the word
[1:21:30] in the book of second corinthians the
[1:21:31] 10th chapter paul actually tells us
[1:21:34] he meant that the weapons of our warfare
[1:21:37] they are not carnal but mighty through
[1:21:39] god to pulling down the strongholds
[1:21:41] casting down imagination
[1:21:44] and every high thing
[1:21:47] what's this that exalt itself against
[1:21:50] the knowledge of god
[1:21:53] now the bible said the people shall know
[1:21:55] their god
[1:21:56] but imaginations and reasoning is going
[1:22:00] to come like never before but the
[1:22:02] scripture says you cast them down and
[1:22:05] remember what you know about god you got
[1:22:09] to remember what you know about god in
[1:22:12] the middle of trial in the middle of
[1:22:14] issues in the middle of problems
[1:22:16] remember what you know about god
[1:22:18] remember this is the very thing whenever
[1:22:21] the scripture declares this it talks
[1:22:23] about how uh that in the days of job
[1:22:25] when job was sitting on a nice sheep and
[1:22:28] remember as he's sitting on the ash
[1:22:29] sheep and his trials are getting on him
[1:22:32] his skin has been eaten up by boils his
[1:22:34] own wife begins to say just curse god
[1:22:36] and die how many knows who that job's
[1:22:38] wife was brother man said your flesh
[1:22:41] he said your own flesh tells you just to
[1:22:43] give up amen but look now job couldn't
[1:22:47] give up because job knew about god
[1:22:50] because of his knowledge of god he had
[1:22:53] to bring his imagination god's turned
[1:22:55] against me god don't love me god ain't
[1:22:58] with me amen every imagination he could
[1:23:00] have but he had to throw it down
[1:23:03] at the knowledge he had of the god that
[1:23:06] he served god had already said he would
[1:23:08] god had already told the devil you won't
[1:23:10] shake him off
[1:23:12] god had already told the devil hey man
[1:23:14] what you're going to do ain't going to
[1:23:15] work but you're going to do everything
[1:23:17] you can do to him but he had a knowledge

[1:24:06] things get hard

[1:24:10] that could just be easily hidden or set
[1:24:12] aside when things don't go the way job
[1:24:15] thought they would go amen but job said

[1:24:32] said job said i know he said old job
[1:24:34] what do you know
[1:24:37] what do you know job he said he knew he
[1:24:40] was god but he was his redeemer i
[1:24:43] thought oh my he knew about a personal
[1:24:46] god he knew a god that could redeem his
[1:24:48] life i tell you this young people amen i
[1:24:51] believe at some part you got to quit it
[1:24:54] being daddy's god it's got to become
[1:24:56] your god it's got to quit being the god
[1:24:59] of just somebody it's going to be your
[1:25:01] god the way you serve your god and job
[1:25:04] knew and job knew that this was god his
[1:25:07] knowledge was of god i'll tell you this
[1:25:11] amen i believe there's a people today
[1:25:13] that know god
[1:25:15] i know there's a people today that know
[1:25:17] god now let me ask you what do you know
[1:25:20] what do you know about your god well
[1:25:22] i'll tell you this i know he's a long
[1:25:24] time god
[1:25:26] i know he's an on time god
[1:25:28] i know he's a faithful god
[1:25:30] i know he's a healer i know my god is a
[1:25:33] savior hey he's a god who is a deliverer
[1:25:37] you know when when the god that i'm
[1:25:38] talking about is the same very god that
[1:25:42] was in the book of genesis introducing
[1:25:45] himself unto abraham
[1:25:47] the same one that said in his tent door
[1:25:50] is the same god that's right here in
[1:25:53] this building tonight
[1:25:55] it is not a different god it is the
[1:25:58] self-saying god in this building tonight
[1:26:02] i want you to see something when abraham
[1:26:04] begin to worship him he called him lord
[1:26:07] capital lordy hello him you see what he
[1:26:11] was a self-existent god if you if you
[1:26:13] follow the life of abraham he only
[1:26:15] believed in one god now he was that was
[1:26:17] his whole life's journey was about
[1:26:19] serving one god do you know he called
[1:26:21] that god when he met him he meant in
[1:26:23] genesis 14 he called him melchizedek
[1:26:27] he's met god and he said he's my king
[1:26:29] and he's my priest he knew him as
[1:26:32] melchizedek and he welcomed him as
[1:26:35] melchizedek as a king priest unto him
[1:26:38] it's amazing of just at the time that
[1:26:41] abraham separates from lot now look at
[1:26:44] this it does not help a lot but it helps
[1:26:46] abraham
[1:26:48] a lot goes on to the city but abraham
[1:26:52] goes on into the promises the moment
[1:26:54] that he begins to separate and he meets
[1:26:57] god on the road remember what he said to
[1:26:59] him he said you are blessed of the most
[1:27:01] high god
[1:27:03] abraham you are blessed of the most high
[1:27:05] god how many realizes the most high god
[1:27:08] is a hebrew word called elyon
[1:27:11] he was blessed of el yon the most high
[1:27:14] god in other words if the god who is the
[1:27:17] most high will bless you there's nobody
[1:27:20] else can come along and take that
[1:27:23] blessing off of you
[1:27:24] i don't care what you're going through
[1:27:26] tonight if god's blessed you you're
[1:27:28] blessed
[1:27:29] it doesn't matter to me what the
[1:27:31] situations are what the problems are i
[1:27:34] think it's time to cast down every
[1:27:37] imagination and say what you know about
[1:27:40] god what do i know about god i know he's
[1:27:43] my king i know he's my priest
[1:27:46] i know he's my very ill yawn there is no
[1:27:50] higher office let me say this to you we
[1:27:52] don't got to go to the secretary brother
[1:27:54] we go to the boss man we ain't going to
[1:27:57] the second person of the godhead or some
[1:27:59] mary to get our way we have received an
[1:28:02] entertainment from the god of all
[1:28:04] creation the one who is god this god who
[1:28:08] is called el john is the same very god i
[1:28:11] know we preached many sermons on it he's
[1:28:14] the same god who's killed el shaddai he
[1:28:16] was the breast of god how many knows
[1:28:18] he's a breasted god he's the strength
[1:28:21] given god is that right so he's also
[1:28:23] elohim the self-existent god now that
[1:28:26] god made some promises unto abraham and
[1:28:29] he told abraham i've given you a
[1:28:31] covenant and that covenant was
[1:28:33] unconditional
[1:28:34] in other words it was an unconditional
[1:28:36] promise made to abraham concerning god
[1:28:39] about abraham it wasn't abraham and and
[1:28:42] if you do this or do this this is going
[1:28:44] to happen god made that promise based on
[1:28:46] his ability to fulfill his word
[1:28:50] when god made a promise to abraham it
[1:28:52] was a
[1:28:53] it was an irrevocable promise well i
[1:28:56] wished i had time to preach on that
[1:28:57] tonight it's an irrevocable promise when
[1:29:00] god promises you and he can't take it
[1:29:03] back you see what i'm saying to you if
[1:29:05] your daddy promises you a thousand
[1:29:07] dollars and he can't lie to you you can
[1:29:09] shout all the way to the bank because
[1:29:12] it's an irrevocable word and our god
[1:29:15] didn't just promise us a prosperity of
[1:29:18] wealth he prospered us in our health and
[1:29:21] in our ability to serve him he is a
[1:29:24] prospering god who has blessed us
[1:29:27] through all spiritual blessing now think
[1:29:30] of this god who abraham served amen but
[1:29:34] but if he was just the god of abraham
[1:29:36] the story's short
[1:29:39] but it was more than the god of abraham
[1:29:41] but when abraham had a son
[1:29:44] amen his son's name was isaac now listen
[1:29:47] this god who was the god of abraham and
[1:29:49] isaac had met moses and had started
[1:29:52] telling moses what kind of god he was
[1:29:55] and he was the god of abraham
[1:29:57] and he was the god of isaac
[1:29:59] now he could not say he was the god of
[1:30:02] isaac until isaac had met him
[1:30:05] he could not say i'm the god of abraham
[1:30:08] and of isaac until isaac had come along
[1:30:12] and isaac had met him and isaac had
[1:30:14] experienced him i can imagine when god
[1:30:17] introduced himself as the god of abraham
[1:30:19] what it meant to the person that was
[1:30:21] hearing it was this is the god that
[1:30:24] changes the elements of the body
[1:30:27] this is the god that makes irrevocable
[1:30:29] promises of supernatural things that no
[1:30:33] man can perform listen to me tonight
[1:30:35] when god made that promise to abraham
[1:30:37] that you shall have a child and sarah
[1:30:39] shall bear it they could not do that
[1:30:42] within themselves it was an
[1:30:44] impossibility for it to happen if you
[1:30:47] don't know god you wouldn't believe my
[1:30:50] story you've got to know the god i'm
[1:30:53] talking about before you will believe
[1:30:56] what i have to say about you in this
[1:30:59] church tonight you've got to believe
[1:31:01] there is a god before i could say to you
[1:31:03] that you are the bride party of jesus
[1:31:06] christ you are the sinless virtuous body
[1:31:09] of the almighty god and god himself is
[1:31:12] dwelling in the church tonight
[1:31:15] unless you believe god you can't believe
[1:31:17] me
[1:31:18] because it ain't possible for you to be
[1:31:20] everything that i'm going to say you are
[1:31:25] now think about this because abraham
[1:31:27] wasn't able but he had a god and that
[1:31:30] god was using a man to identify
[1:31:34] what kind of god he was
[1:31:36] he took a man who couldn't he took a
[1:31:38] woman who couldn't and he did it through
[1:31:41] them anyhow i don't know if y'all ever
[1:31:42] stop and really thought about this
[1:31:45] but according to the message of the hour
[1:31:47] abraham and sarah were a hundred years
[1:31:49] old
[1:31:51] and they were barren even when sarah was
[1:31:54] young
[1:31:56] god didn't only make them new
[1:31:59] he didn't only make them young he had to
[1:32:02] change their bodies
[1:32:03] now look god can do that but god can't
[1:32:06] lie
[1:32:07] god couldn't tell abraham something and
[1:32:10] then back up on the promise if god told
[1:32:13] him something god could change the
[1:32:15] elements of his body but he couldn't lie
[1:32:17] to abraham so god the creator abraham's
[1:32:21] god came down and met with them and
[1:32:23] entertained them and after he left there
[1:32:26] was something beginning to stir around
[1:32:28] the camp of abraham elements and their
[1:32:30] bodies began to be energized they
[1:32:33] literally changed their body by the
[1:32:36] entertainment of the angel of almighty
[1:32:38] god
[1:32:39] that same angel is in this building
[1:32:42] tonight and is here to be entertained
[1:32:45] until there's a change a physical change
[1:32:49] comes into the body this angel will not
[1:32:51] leave the earth until this bride's body
[1:32:54] has been changed
[1:32:58] i will dwell with him i shall be their
[1:33:00] god and they shall be
[1:33:03] my people
[1:33:04] [Applause]
[1:33:06] you might not know who you are but i
[1:33:08] know who you are you're the people the
[1:33:10] bible prophesied that would know this
[1:33:13] god
[1:33:16] abraham knew him he knew him as a god
[1:33:19] that could breathe over a body and he
[1:33:21] could watch his wife in her late age
[1:33:24] stricken could see her melt back to a
[1:33:27] young woman her backbone would
[1:33:29] straighten up her gray hair would become
[1:33:32] black again her womb would become
[1:33:34] fertile her old heart would be made
[1:33:36] young because they entertained
[1:33:47] all right god
[1:33:48] was the one sitting there talking to
[1:33:50] moses out of that bush and he was
[1:33:52] introducing himself
[1:33:54] i'll tell you you can't know a man
[1:33:56] unless he's been introduced correctly to
[1:33:58] you
[1:33:59] you might know a man a certain way but
[1:34:02] somebody else that knows him in a
[1:34:03] different way could introduce him and
[1:34:05] it'll blow your mind i never will forget
[1:34:07] when sean and wendell martin's
[1:34:09] brother-in-law jonathan them boys
[1:34:11] brother-in-law brother matt mclearn he i
[1:34:13] just knew he was a country boy sitting
[1:34:14] at my table eating breakfast good old
[1:34:16] boy he was a gunsmith and one day sean
[1:34:18] says to me he said you know he's the
[1:34:20] world champion pistol shot in 1991 don't
[1:34:22] you i said i had no idea i was sitting
[1:34:25] in the presence of greatness and didn't
[1:34:26] know it
[1:34:28] until somebody introduced that to me i
[1:34:31] didn't know it now later he took me out
[1:34:32] to the range
[1:34:34] i could tell people that guy's good that
[1:34:35] guy's good because he had a champion you
[1:34:37] can't be good but you can't get that
[1:34:39] without being good sorry i had a right
[1:34:41] to call him good but i'd never
[1:34:42] personally experienced it
[1:34:44] i'm sorry i'm just going to preach while
[1:34:45] i'm preaching but but but we went up to
[1:34:48] the cafe one day and he's talking about
[1:34:50] deer hunting with me and we pulled it
[1:34:52] out i said well i had a little deer
[1:34:53] rifle we brush hunted like here just
[1:34:55] short shots you know 30 30s and things
[1:34:57] and i said i got a little deer rifle
[1:34:59] maybe 30 30 or something will get you he
[1:35:01] said i don't need that brother wayne
[1:35:02] said i got my pistol
[1:35:05] i said okay well i'll get you a deer
[1:35:06] rifle it'd be all right you can carry a
[1:35:08] pistol makes you feel better he said
[1:35:10] brother wayne he said i ain't shoot a
[1:35:11] quarter 200 yards of this gun
[1:35:16] well i'm from arkansas
[1:35:17] [Laughter]
[1:35:21] i'd heard a lot of wendy's in my day
[1:35:24] i actually told him a story about two
[1:35:26] buys floating down the river i said they
[1:35:28] were floating down the river and looked
[1:35:29] down on the bottom a guy seen a glow
[1:35:30] down there and he said what in the world
[1:35:32] is that the other guy threw his reel
[1:35:34] down there and hooked this thing and
[1:35:36] started reeling this thing up to the top
[1:35:37] and got it up and it was a coleman
[1:35:38] lantern
[1:35:39] and it was lit and it was still burning
[1:35:41] on the bottom of the of the river
[1:35:43] he said are you kidding i said i'll tell
[1:35:45] you what i'll do i'll blow out the fire
[1:35:47] on that lantern if you'll take 30 yards
[1:35:48] off that shot
[1:35:55] he said you got a range i said i do he
[1:35:57] said come on
[1:35:58] i took a quarter and laid it and traced
[1:36:00] it and drawed it in zach was probably
[1:36:01] with us
[1:36:02] he was probably the runner run that baby
[1:36:05] after 100 yards and hang it and matt
[1:36:06] walked back up there and pulled out his
[1:36:08] pistol and he didn't use a little rock
[1:36:10] though he put it right on there and
[1:36:13] drilled that quarter at 100 yards i said
[1:36:15] hi it's luck
[1:36:17] three out of three drilled that quarter
[1:36:19] i couldn't do it with my 30
[1:36:22] 30. see i had a right to call him good
[1:36:26] but then now i've got a personal
[1:36:28] testimony i've seen it with my eyes
[1:36:30] and i can read about god right here and
[1:36:32] say he's the god of somebody but i got
[1:36:35] another right tonight i've experienced
[1:36:38] the power of this god i've seen him
[1:36:40] raise the dead i've seen cripples get up
[1:36:43] and walk i've seen lives changed i've
[1:36:45] seen things happen right in the midst of
[1:36:48] us and i've got every right tonight to
[1:36:50] praise him and to say that he is the god
[1:36:53] of abraham
[1:36:58] oh yes sir i got a right to say it
[1:37:00] he is the god of abraham he's a change
[1:37:02] of things now look when he introduces
[1:37:05] himself to isaac he introduces himself
[1:37:07] as the god of his father but isaac amen
[1:37:10] when he's when he knows him god later
[1:37:13] comes to jacob you ever watched the
[1:37:15] scriptures and look how the consecutive
[1:37:16] of us goes when he introduces himself to
[1:37:19] jacob in the scripture in the book of
[1:37:20] genesis god comes to jacob and he says
[1:37:23] to him i'm the god of abraham and isaac
[1:37:26] now that same god to moses will say i'm
[1:37:29] the god of abraham isaac and jacob but
[1:37:32] he's not saying that to jacob he's
[1:37:33] talking to jacob
[1:37:35] i'm the god of abraham and isaac and i'm
[1:37:37] about to become your god you're about to
[1:37:40] become my symbol i'm about to make you a
[1:37:43] product of the god that i am but i got
[1:37:46] to deal with you i got to talk to you i
[1:37:48] got a fellowship with you and i'm going
[1:37:50] to use you to prove what kind of god i
[1:37:52] am
[1:37:54] uh
[1:37:55] jacob
[1:37:56] poor old jacob his name said it all
[1:37:59] he was a deceiver so planner wasn't he
[1:38:02] he was a bad boy amen but you know what
[1:38:04] in all of that deceiving and trouble
[1:38:06] there was something in jacob different
[1:38:07] than he saw
[1:38:09] jacob desired that birthright and he
[1:38:11] didn't know really how to get it but he
[1:38:12] knew he wanted it he knew it was worth
[1:38:14] anything and much more than anything
[1:38:16] else so whenever jacob amen actually
[1:38:20] meets the angel on the river that night
[1:38:23] the bible tells us amen that jacob got a
[1:38:26] hold of something that he knew was god
[1:38:30] oh there's a connection isn't it with
[1:38:31] abraham and jacob now he knew it was god
[1:38:34] dealing with him he knew god had come by
[1:38:37] the river you know what he said to him
[1:38:39] he said i'll let you go until you bless
[1:38:41] me i'll not i'll not just let you come
[1:38:44] and leave this meeting i'll not let you
[1:38:47] just pass by and not fulfill your wishes
[1:38:50] and your commands upon my life i want
[1:38:52] everybody to know you're my god i want
[1:38:55] to be identified with this kind of god
[1:38:58] and he held on the bible said unto that
[1:39:00] angel the angel said let me go he said i
[1:39:02] won't let you go till you bless me and
[1:39:03] the bible said they wrestled unto the
[1:39:06] horizon of the sun
[1:39:10] now i know i know sometimes that people
[1:39:12] will say to our young people i've seen
[1:39:14] our young people up laboring in prayer
[1:39:16] you know
[1:39:18] they're praying and they're asking god
[1:39:20] for help and they're praying and people
[1:39:22] are going so well just going back to
[1:39:23] your chair now there's no need and all
[1:39:25] this stuff you know just going back and
[1:39:27] everything will be all right it's okay
[1:39:29] listen
[1:39:30] if that young person is desiring an
[1:39:33] experience with a living god
[1:39:38] there had to be an experience first
[1:39:42] you couldn't desire it if there wasn't
[1:39:44] something somewhere that could fulfill
[1:39:46] it
[1:39:48] abraham couldn't desire the change
[1:39:51] unless there was a change somewhere
[1:39:53] jacob could not desire a blessing unless
[1:39:56] there was a blessing somewhere and he
[1:39:58] held on till he got what he was looking
[1:40:00] for and i'll tell you some people the
[1:40:02] reason they push this away they push the
[1:40:05] entertaining of the angel away is
[1:40:06] because they never entertained the angel
[1:40:10] they don't know what it's like to
[1:40:11] wrestle with the anointing until the
[1:40:14] anointing conquers you
[1:40:16] and you know you know you're laying
[1:40:18] there and you're arguing with that and
[1:40:20] you're saying well i know i need to
[1:40:22] forgive my sister i know i need to
[1:40:23] forgive my brother i know everybody
[1:40:24] needs forgiveness and lord i really want
[1:40:26] to serve you but i got to get revenge
[1:40:28] before i serve you i got something i got
[1:40:29] to do i got a little issue and you're
[1:40:31] wrestling with that thing but you're
[1:40:33] holding on to the angel at the same time
[1:40:36] because you do not want him to get away
[1:40:38] so after a little while the anointing
[1:40:41] begins to conquer amen it begins to
[1:40:43] conquer the old flesh called jacob after
[1:40:46] a while the conquering power of the
[1:40:49] anointing begins to move on you
[1:40:54] i've never in my life
[1:40:56] been able to fully grip it but
[1:41:00] i could only imagine
[1:41:02] when an angel
[1:41:03] pressed him in the thigh
[1:41:06] and he walked away
[1:41:09] and the angel said there you go
[1:41:11] you got what you were after
[1:41:13] but i can't call you jacob no more
[1:41:16] i'll have to call you israel
[1:41:19] i'll have to speak of you as israel
[1:41:22] because there's been a change
[1:41:24] the name jacob cannot represent you
[1:41:26] anymore you you're not the same person
[1:41:29] after this angel after this anointing
[1:41:31] after this has come you're not him
[1:41:33] anymore you can't even walk the same way
[1:41:35] if you wanted to
[1:41:36] maybe jacob walked in certain crowds and
[1:41:39] he tried to hide that experience he
[1:41:41] tried to hide that he had been laying
[1:41:43] with an angel and wrestling in the power
[1:41:45] of god he tried to hide he spent all
[1:41:47] night in prayer but he couldn't do it
[1:41:50] his walk was revealing it his stagger
[1:41:55] he walks in the room somebody said
[1:41:56] what's wrong with your leg did you fall
[1:41:58] off your horse no no well tell me what's
[1:42:01] wrong well if you're going to press me
[1:42:02] i'll tell you i was up at the river last
[1:42:05] night and the power of an angel came by
[1:42:07] my way and we wrestled all over the bank
[1:42:09] until i was muddy and wet and stinging
[1:42:12] and all of a sudden he pushed his thumb
[1:42:15] and my thigh
[1:42:16] and he made a promise to me and i tell
[1:42:19] you my name now is israel
[1:42:22] i am a prince with god
[1:42:25] he never was a prince brother he never
[1:42:27] was a prince andrew remember joseph come
[1:42:30] out of them loins amen it was a power of
[1:42:32] god that moved over him they said what
[1:42:35] he did joseph amen jacob got the feeling
[1:42:38] of that and god left there with a new
[1:42:41] identity he was being known as the god
[1:42:44] of jacob have you ever noticed that that
[1:42:46] whenever god goes to moses he introduces
[1:42:49] himself and he said i'm the god of
[1:42:50] abraham i'm the god of isaac and i'm the
[1:42:53] god of jacob
[1:42:54] his name ain't been jacob for years
[1:42:57] why is he introducing himself to moses
[1:43:00] as jacob why didn't he introduce himself
[1:43:02] as israel
[1:43:03] why didn't he introduce himself to moses
[1:43:05] before jacob
[1:43:08] because moses was a runaway prophet
[1:43:11] moses was a failure
[1:43:13] moses had made a lot of mistakes moses
[1:43:16] was up there hiding from the very call
[1:43:18] of god that was upon his life and god
[1:43:21] had come and found him and of course by
[1:43:23] now moses that stuttering prophet had
[1:43:25] begun to give up on the idea that god
[1:43:27] would ever deliver he began to lose the
[1:43:30] thought that the holy ghost would ever
[1:43:32] really deliver and come out in his life
[1:43:34] you see what was going on is while he
[1:43:37] was back there living under his failure
[1:43:39] living under his weakness he was not
[1:43:42] fulfilling the call of god but god had a
[1:43:44] call anyhow brother william and when he
[1:43:46] called him he said i'm the god of
[1:43:48] abraham i'm isaac and of jacob and the
[1:43:52] name jacob was the god who came to the
[1:43:55] man who was a failure and a deceiver an
[1:44:00] irreverent man but god could come to him
[1:44:03] anyhow let me say something to you
[1:44:05] tonight amen you might have been hiding
[1:44:07] from god you might have failed god in
[1:44:10] your call in your walk in your christian
[1:44:12] life but he's the god of jacob tonight
[1:44:15] and that god has come down in the church
[1:44:18] to introduce himself as the god of jacob
[1:44:21] listen as the god of jacob god would
[1:44:24] introduce himself he knew him as isaac
[1:44:26] he knew him as jacob
[1:44:28] now it was amazing to me how the
[1:44:30] scriptures are written because it's not
[1:44:32] very far from here when you're studying
[1:44:34] this line of thought you'll come across
[1:44:37] one where god will introduce himself
[1:44:40] upon mount carmel
[1:44:41] and up on mount carmel there's a people
[1:44:43] now there's an 11th hour people who was
[1:44:46] with a with with elijah on mount carmel
[1:44:49] but the name of baal has been so lifted
[1:44:52] until the true children of god had been
[1:44:54] pushed back and baal was being
[1:44:56] worshipped instead of jehovah but elijah
[1:44:59] was there for a showdown so he builds
[1:45:02] himself an altar and while this altar is
[1:45:04] being built he builds it according to
[1:45:06] the word and then he backs up and he
[1:45:08] said now let it be known today
[1:45:11] that the god of abraham
[1:45:14] the god of isaac and the god of israel
[1:45:18] he doesn't call him jacob on that
[1:45:19] mountain he doesn't call him i wonder
[1:45:22] why he don't call him jacob on that
[1:45:24] mountain he called him israel because
[1:45:27] elijah is talking to god's enemies the
[1:45:31] god of baal and the prophets of baal and
[1:45:33] he will not reveal the weakness of jacob
[1:45:36] to the enemy he's talking to but rather
[1:45:39] he covers him and calls him the god of
[1:45:41] israel let me tell you the spirit of
[1:45:43] elijah amen in this day did not reveal
[1:45:47] your secrets to the world but he called
[1:45:49] you by another name to bring another
[1:45:52] grace over your lives
[1:45:55] you see where it's at tonight the god of
[1:45:57] israel
[1:45:58] come over you this is the same god this
[1:46:01] god of israel is the god of elijah
[1:46:05] oh i tell you i know about that god of
[1:46:07] elijah
[1:46:09] this god of elijah was a god that rang
[1:46:11] the fire
[1:46:12] down on the mountain and a group of
[1:46:14] people saw it and they began to scream
[1:46:17] with one voice god is god
[1:46:20] those people that saw the firefall was a
[1:46:23] type of the believer that is living
[1:46:26] today when they saw the fire of god they
[1:46:30] begin to say he is god because they knew
[1:46:34] him by the manifestation of the spirit
[1:46:38] of god you know what he did brother he
[1:46:39] didn't leave that quad up there on the
[1:46:41] mountain
[1:46:44] it was coming elijah's time to leave the
[1:46:46] scene god was fishing to carry him so
[1:46:48] what he did is he sent him on a journey
[1:46:51] to find a young man remember what he
[1:46:53] does he goes down there and finds elisha
[1:46:56] who's working and he goes by and drapes
[1:46:58] his mantle over him hey man and all of a
[1:47:00] sudden elijah jumps up and starts
[1:47:02] running after him he said what did i do
[1:47:03] to you go back to your about your mom
[1:47:05] and dad and go back to your work and he
[1:47:08] said no as the lord liveth i'll not go
[1:47:10] back you know what he did he went and
[1:47:11] burnt his oxen he went and destroyed all
[1:47:15] of his his former works and began to
[1:47:17] study and follow this man elijah now he
[1:47:21] began to follow him and one day elijah
[1:47:24] made him a promise and he said if you
[1:47:26] can see me when i go
[1:47:29] he said you'll get a double portion of
[1:47:31] the power that rests on me
[1:47:34] well i'll tell you after that day they
[1:47:36] went to different places
[1:47:38] they visited different schools they went
[1:47:40] to different theological centers
[1:47:42] and some of them said to elisha well
[1:47:44] this is far enough you shouldn't go any
[1:47:45] further than this and elisha said well
[1:47:47] as the lord liveth
[1:47:49] as the lord liveth
[1:47:51] i'll not stay here for my master will be
[1:47:54] taken from me you remember what he said
[1:47:57] they took him down the school of
[1:47:58] prophets and they said well this is a
[1:47:59] good place to stay brother bam said
[1:48:01] theology wasn't a good place to rest he
[1:48:03] said elisha couldn't be satisfied there
[1:48:05] because he had already seen the power
[1:48:07] ministrated
[1:48:08] he'd already seen the power of god so
[1:48:11] elisha wouldn't allow he meant that to
[1:48:14] stop there he was going to follow it
[1:48:16] until something changed now look what
[1:48:18] he'd done he followed him all the way
[1:48:19] down to the jordan and one of the
[1:48:21] greatest acts of elijah was when he took
[1:48:24] off his robe and he slapped the jordan
[1:48:26] river and when the jordan began to open
[1:48:28] up and they walked across the jordan on
[1:48:31] dry trop when they got to the other side
[1:48:33] there were chariots of fire that were
[1:48:35] tied in the bushes all around the banks
[1:48:38] of jordan
[1:48:39] and elisha watched as his master elijah
[1:48:42] went over and got into one of those
[1:48:44] chariots and let's say you know up
[1:48:46] through the air they went and they
[1:48:48] started going up into the sky as they
[1:48:50] were disappearing from sight now could
[1:48:52] now listen it's not a that's not disney
[1:48:55] this really happened
[1:48:59] it's not disney this really happened
[1:49:01] a man in a chariot of fire
[1:49:04] flying up through the sky
[1:49:06] and there was a man watching it happen
[1:49:10] he was watching his master disappear but
[1:49:13] there's something there's something
[1:49:14] coming
[1:49:16] all of a sudden the mantle that the man
[1:49:18] wore
[1:49:20] begin to fall on the ground in front of
[1:49:23] elisha
[1:49:25] now listen elisha didn't go grab that
[1:49:27] man off of elijah
[1:49:29] elisha didn't go up there and say well
[1:49:31] it's about that time and grab the mantle
[1:49:33] off of him and begin to try to make
[1:49:35] himself something no sir he let the
[1:49:37] mantle hit the ground
[1:49:39] he let god's servant and then he let
[1:49:42] that mantle hit the ground now watch
[1:49:44] what he did he didn't just go out there
[1:49:46] and walk around that mantle and say
[1:49:48] y'all god sent a prophet to the age god
[1:49:51] sent a prophet and he said this and he
[1:49:53] said this and he said this oh i tell you
[1:49:55] god sent elijah to us and we all seen
[1:49:59] the miracles of whoa glory god said amen
[1:50:02] you see what it is he meant after a
[1:50:04] little while of watching that he knew he
[1:50:07] was to pick that up he knew god had
[1:50:10] anointed him to pick that up and he
[1:50:12] walked over and picked that mantle up
[1:50:14] off of the ground listen to me now this
[1:50:17] bride today is not taking anything from
[1:50:22] elijah the prophet they are receiving
[1:50:25] what a prophet gave them
[1:50:27] they are receiving what elijah sent back
[1:50:31] upon them a mantle of the almighty god
[1:50:34] and when elijah picked up that mantle he
[1:50:37] walked over to the river now look where
[1:50:39] he started he started with the prophet
[1:50:41] stopped
[1:50:43] we had already been through three of
[1:50:45] those pools he started in that third
[1:50:47] pool he walked right up to that river
[1:50:49] brother andrew and he slapped that river
[1:50:51] and he said where is the lord god of
[1:50:55] elijah he didn't ask where is elijah he
[1:50:58] didn't ask can elijah come back and fix
[1:51:00] this problem he said where is the god of
[1:51:03] elijah and the waters begin to be parted
[1:51:07] because the god of elijah had stayed
[1:51:10] with the message of elijah and i'll tell
[1:51:12] you something tonight there's a bride
[1:51:14] that has received the message of
[1:51:16] almighty god and the very god that's
[1:51:19] with this message is the same god that
[1:51:22] was with william branham in their
[1:51:24] meetings the same angel is still in the
[1:51:28] house of god in the last days
[1:51:30] let me tell you this people say to me
[1:51:32] where is the god of elijah i'll tell you
[1:51:34] what he's here and the god of elijah is
[1:51:37] right here in this building tonight the
[1:51:39] god of elijah's here satan's trying to
[1:51:41] block your blessing but the god of
[1:51:43] elijah's here satan's trying to stop the
[1:51:46] entertaining of the angel but the
[1:51:48] elijah's god is in this building tonight
[1:51:52] the same god that was back there is the
[1:51:55] same god that's right here tonight let
[1:51:58] me tell you brother bam tells us the
[1:51:59] story of how elisha moved right on he
[1:52:02] said he moved right on and and remember
[1:52:04] when the shunamite built a little a
[1:52:06] little room by inspiration
[1:52:09] sometimes you do things and don't
[1:52:10] understand them but she just wanted to
[1:52:12] entertain the angel of god she just
[1:52:14] wanted god's prophet to be welcomed so
[1:52:17] she built him a little room but one day
[1:52:20] while the prophet was laying on the bed
[1:52:22] he said go get the woman and then the
[1:52:23] woman walked in the room he said let's
[1:52:25] say the lord you'll have a child and
[1:52:28] then in that barren womb you will
[1:52:30] produce a child remember that and that
[1:52:32] elisha gave her a baby because it was
[1:52:36] the god of elijah walking through
[1:52:39] elijah's ministry it was not a different
[1:52:41] god a few days later the child began to
[1:52:44] die remember what did they do with that
[1:52:46] child they brought him right back to the
[1:52:48] bed where elisha had laid and prophesied
[1:52:52] of the coming of the child and there was
[1:52:54] a revival of the child it was because
[1:52:57] god the god of elisha was still alive
[1:53:00] let me tell you something tonight that
[1:53:02] same god is still alive in this building
[1:53:06] it ain't been too long ago brother
[1:53:08] nathan erickson came to the church and
[1:53:10] him and cheyenne and they told me sir
[1:53:11] brother wayne we've been to the doctor
[1:53:13] and they have told us that it's nearly
[1:53:15] impossible that we could ever have
[1:53:17] another child it's just nearly
[1:53:19] impossible they said but we've been
[1:53:20] believing god's going to give us a boy
[1:53:22] and we just want to believe and of
[1:53:24] course you know what that is the rock
[1:53:26] and roll up and down up and down month
[1:53:28] to month are we going to have it are we
[1:53:30] not going to have just like this amen
[1:53:32] one day we were down uh down in i
[1:53:34] believe it was last june we were down
[1:53:36] in nathan bryant's meetings and we were
[1:53:38] preaching there and the holy spirit came
[1:53:40] in that building and the end of the
[1:53:42] service we had a prayer line and in that
[1:53:44] prayer line
[1:53:46] now it's not about me it's about these
[1:53:47] prayer lines and then and there was
[1:53:50] there was people sitting there in
[1:53:51] jeffersonville right right next to
[1:53:52] jeffersonville where nathan is and there
[1:53:54] was elders in that meeting that had been
[1:53:56] in those meetings in branham tabernacle
[1:53:59] in brother graham's prayer lines and
[1:54:00] they said brother nathan the same
[1:54:03] atmosphere that was in them prophets and
[1:54:06] prayer lines was in that prayer line
[1:54:08] tonight it was the same feeling in that
[1:54:10] building that was in that feeling back
[1:54:12] there in the 60s when the prophet prayed
[1:54:15] after we prayed brother nathan come to
[1:54:17] the prayer line that night he said
[1:54:18] brother wayne i want that baby and we
[1:54:20] laid hands preyed on him and sister and
[1:54:22] we go down into the we go down into the
[1:54:24] recesses of the office after the meeting
[1:54:26] when we go down there we're just sitting
[1:54:27] there weeping in the presence of god
[1:54:29] nathan walked up and he put his hand on
[1:54:31] his desk and he looked at me said well
[1:54:33] wayne it's done it's done tonight god
[1:54:36] has just touched our body we're gonna
[1:54:38] have that baby brother wayne and you
[1:54:40] know what hey man i don't know when's

[1:54:44] huh
[1:54:45] it's due next month amen that baby she
[1:54:48] comes over to the house
[1:54:52] there's nothing like seeing
[1:54:55] a woman walk in the door that they
[1:54:57] couldn't have a baby and they come
[1:54:59] walking in
[1:55:00] oh i tell you it's one of the prettiest
[1:55:01] sights you ever saw because the life
[1:55:04] that they're carrying came from a
[1:55:06] miracle working almighty god
[1:55:09] i tell you he's still the god of isaac
[1:55:12] isn't he come on where's david in this
[1:55:14] building tonight he's the god of isaac
[1:55:17] didn't he if there was no god there's no
[1:55:19] isaac
[1:55:20] in the days of abraham without god there
[1:55:23] was no isaac and tonight without a real
[1:55:26] god brother david there's no isaac but
[1:55:28] he's the god of isaac tonight because
[1:55:32] the supernatural god came on the scene
[1:55:37] now listen this stuff don't get a long
[1:55:38] ways from my brother adam said i'll
[1:55:40] prove to you he's the same god of elijah
[1:55:42] he said a barren woman come up in my
[1:55:44] prayer line the other night i laid hands
[1:55:45] he said we've just now dedicated the
[1:55:47] baby
[1:55:51] i tell you i love this
[1:55:53] i'll tell you what it's one of the
[1:55:54] greatest days of my life to sit here and
[1:55:56] tell you this
[1:55:58] a few years ago zechariah married anna
[1:56:00] sitting right over there
[1:56:01] and they was trying to have babies and
[1:56:03] problems started coming up
[1:56:05] i don't remember the
[1:56:07] i don't remember words well enough but
[1:56:09] some people were telling her that she
[1:56:10] had a certain problem and she wouldn't
[1:56:12] be able to have children maybe and just
[1:56:14] hereditary or something
[1:56:16] and it went rocked along a couple years
[1:56:18] i don't want to expose too much but
[1:56:20] maybe about three miscarriages
[1:56:22] was it three
[1:56:23] it was two miscarriages and they they
[1:56:25] were trying and trying and trying
[1:56:27] and brother ron had come over to our
[1:56:29] church in october meeting
[1:56:31] and then turned around and come right
[1:56:32] back in may which was odd usually he
[1:56:33] came every october and he said i got
[1:56:35] some unfinished business
[1:56:37] and he come over there and he was
[1:56:39] dealing with some things
[1:56:40] hey man but while i was sitting there i
[1:56:42] was sitting there praying for that for
[1:56:45] zach and anna and all of a sudden they
[1:56:47] got up and come out to the prayer line
[1:56:49] and we were standing there we started
[1:56:51] praying for him and brother ron he just
[1:56:52] looks up at him the oddest look and he
[1:56:55] says i believe he's speaking directly to
[1:56:56] anna and he said you're going to have
[1:56:58] that child sis
[1:56:59] god just showed me you're going to have
