[52:08] there in the youth service in Tennessee
[52:10] I know they're having a glorious time
[52:11] and certainly looking forward to hearing
[52:13] everything the Lord has done amenl if
[52:16] you'll turn with me this evening to the
[52:19] gospel of St John we'll read in several
[52:21] places but St John chapter 1 and then
[52:24] Romans then over to Romans and then the
[52:27] book of First John so I'll kind of try
[52:29] and go slow between each reading there
[52:31] to give you a chance to flip but we'll
[52:33] begin with first John chapter 1 do you
[52:36] love the Lord tonight amen thank the
[52:39] Lord Jesus in John chapter 1 we'll begin
[52:41] with the first
[52:43] verse in the beginning was the word and
[52:46] the Word was with God and the Word was
[52:48] God the same was in the beginning with
[52:51] God all things were made by him and
[52:54] without him was not anything made that
[52:56] was made made in him was life and the
[52:59] life was the light of men and the light
[53:02] shineth in darkness and the Darkness
[53:05] comprehended it not there was a man sent
[53:08] from God whose name was John the same
[53:12] came for a witness to Bear witness of
[53:14] the light that all men through him might
[53:17] believe he was not that light now John
[53:21] the Baptist was a light but he was not
[53:24] that light
[53:27] but was sent to Bear witness of that
[53:30] light that was the True Light which lith
[53:33] every man that cometh into the world he
[53:35] was in the world and the world was made
[53:38] by him and the world knew him not he
[53:41] came into his own and his own received
[53:43] him not but as many as received him to
[53:47] them gave he power to become the sons of
[53:49] God even to them that believe on his
[53:52] name which were born not of blood nor
[53:55] the will of the flesh nor of the will of
[53:59] man but of God Amen Romans chapter 8
[54:04] verse1 just one scripture reading
[54:10] here Paul's speaking he said there is
[54:13] therefore now no condemnation say no
[54:20] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[54:24] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[54:28] after the
[54:30] spirit there is therefore now no
[54:33] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[54:36] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[54:39] after the spirit in 1 John chapter
[54:42] 1 verse
[54:45] five John is the disciple of Love is
[54:47] that
[54:48] right and the and the bride has got a
[54:51] very special connection as as you're
[54:52] flipping there the bride has got a very
[54:54] special connection with the disciple of
[54:55] John
[54:57] both in the gospel there's very
[54:58] interesting things that he covers there
[55:00] that's not covered by the other other
[55:02] disciples but in 1 John chapter 1 verse
[55:05] verse chapter 1 verse 5 excuse me this
[55:08] then is the message which we have heard
[55:10] of him and declare unto you that God is
[55:13] light and in him is no Darkness at all
[55:18] if we say that we have fellowship with
[55:20] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[55:23] not the
[55:24] truth but if everybody say if but if we
[55:30] walk in the light as he is in the light
[55:35] we have Fellowship one with another and
[55:39] that's a very powerful important
[55:41] conjunction there the blood of Jesus
[55:44] Christ his son cleanses us from all sin
[55:49] amen may God add His blessings to the
[55:51] reading of the word you may be
[55:53] seated I want to read verse 7 again but
[55:55] if we walk in the
[55:58] light as he is in the light see these
[56:01] are very important ingredients here very
[56:04] important scenario because you have to
[56:06] not only walk in the light but you have
[56:08] to walk in the light as he is in the
[56:12] light we have fellowship with one
[56:15] another
[56:16] and the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[56:20] cleanses us from all sin with the help
[56:23] of the Lord I'd like to title this this
[56:25] evening just Jus ified by faith in the
[56:29] light in St John chap 8:31 Jesus
[56:33] speaking he said then said Jesus to
[56:36] those Jews which believed on him if ye
[56:39] continue in my word then are ye my
[56:43] disciples indeed see the Bible would a
[56:46] lot of times classify nominal Believers
[56:48] and Believers as the disciples the the
[56:50] people were called Disciples that
[56:51] actually followed him for the for the
[56:53] Loaves and for the fishes and the
[56:55] Miracles but when the the word began
[56:57] brother Jerry to be laid down True
[56:59] Discipleship was tested as Jesus said if
[57:03] ye continue in my word so as the word
[57:07] unfolds you you prove your election by
[57:10] being able to continue in what God is
[57:13] doing in your day and
[57:15] age now what is
[57:18] light we know in the natural that we
[57:20] know what light is we know what that is
[57:23] but there's also a spiritual light light
[57:26] is when God will vindicate his word
[57:30] whenever in other words vindicate means
[57:31] to bring it to pass when God speak
[57:34] something it's a promise out there
[57:37] whether it's through a prophet or when
[57:38] God said let there be
[57:41] light if it might have been thousands of
[57:43] years before the light actually
[57:44] manifested it wasn't light yet but
[57:46] whenever light natural light literally
[57:49] began to to to burst forth that then
[57:52] became God's word was Vindicated God
[57:55] then proved that he was God because when
[57:57] he said let every seed bring forth of
[58:00] its kind and each seed actually brought
[58:02] forth of its kind then that then
[58:05] Vindicated that God what God Said that
[58:07] God was
[58:08] God so light is when the word is
[58:12] manifested and he vindicates his word by
[58:16] bringing it to
[58:18] pass we all have a desire to serve a
[58:22] living we a living God we want reality
[58:26] we don't just want forms we don't just
[58:28] want Creeds we don't want
[58:30] religion I can't stand religion I can't
[58:34] stand being religious Cain was religious
[58:37] I want to be a true Holy Ghost filled
[58:41] Christian Satan is religious it's not
[58:44] it's not about religion people kill in
[58:47] the name of religion all the
[58:49] time now in the sermon there is a man
[58:52] here that can turn on the light he says
[58:54] now what God Said separates Darkness
[58:57] from light or light from darkness and he
[58:59] separates death from life and he does it
[59:01] by his word his word is what always
[59:04] brings us forth now light well now the
[59:07] seed was already in the earth I believe
[59:10] God had planted the seed just as long as
[59:12] the sun could get to that seed it began
[59:16] to grow so when God created the heavens
[59:18] and the Earth the seed was laying in the
[59:21] earth and then but the the Earth was
[59:24] dark and it was void and there was
[59:25] nothing to bring forth the life all that
[59:28] seed needed that was in the darkness of
[59:30] the earth and in the chaos was a little
[59:32] light to get on it and when the light
[59:34] fell and begin to warm the Earth the
[59:37] seed the power of that seed was already
[59:40] within
[59:42] itself so just like the elect of God you
[59:45] were in darkness and all you needed was
[59:47] the s o n to shine on your elected seed
[59:50] and you sprung
[59:52] forth that's all you needed
[59:56] all it needed was life he says so life
[59:59] is only by the word of God made manifest
[1:00:02] life comes only by the word of God May
[1:00:04] manifest as long as it's just in the
[1:00:06] book like this it can still be
[1:00:10] questioned but when it's manifest when
[1:00:12] it's made manifest then you see the
[1:00:15] product of what it spoke of being
[1:00:18] manifested now that does not give us a
[1:00:20] right to question it just because it
[1:00:22] hadn't come to pass because God has a
[1:00:24] perfect track record
[1:00:26] but the prophet is making the point that
[1:00:28] when it's in when it's in in word form
[1:00:31] it hasn't shine forth yet but then
[1:00:34] whenever it's Vindicated and then people
[1:00:36] when people doubt that that's sin that's
[1:00:40] right that in essence is real
[1:00:43] Sin when God said something and then it
[1:00:47] brings it and then people will sit there
[1:00:48] and they'll analyze it and they'll try
[1:00:50] inject their own ideas but then God
[1:00:51] actually brings it to pass and then
[1:00:54] people reject it that sin they're a
[1:00:58] sinner I don't care how many times they
[1:01:00] go to church a week they reject the
[1:01:02] manifestation of the word for that day
[1:01:05] and that's
[1:01:07] sin the priest never missed a sacrifice
[1:01:10] the priest never missed a day at church
[1:01:12] the priest never missed a religious
[1:01:15] order but yet they rejected the very
[1:01:18] word in
[1:01:20] flesh in St John 3 Jesus speaking 18 he
[1:01:22] said he that believeth on him is not
[1:01:25] condemned
[1:01:26] but he that believeth not is condemned
[1:01:28] already because he hath believed not
[1:01:31] believed in the name of the only
[1:01:32] begotten Son of God and this is the
[1:01:35] condemnation that light is coming into
[1:01:38] the world and Men love Darkness rather
[1:01:41] than
[1:01:43] light they literally love the the the
[1:01:46] darkness more than light when the word
[1:01:49] is manifested and and there's no how
[1:01:52] many people would come to the prophets
[1:01:54] to to the prophet secretly say we know
[1:01:56] it's the truth we know what baptism in
[1:01:59] the name of Jesus Christ is the right we
[1:02:01] know the godhead and how you're
[1:02:02] preaching is right but if we preach that
[1:02:04] we're going to lose our
[1:02:06] congregation they love Darkness more
[1:02:09] than
[1:02:11] light they were
[1:02:15] Sinners so people are always looking
[1:02:18] what are the works of God what what you
[1:02:20] know there can be zealous religious
[1:02:23] they're zealous to do religious Works
[1:02:25] they're good people
[1:02:27] so Jesus so they came to Jesus with the
[1:02:29] same question and they said unto him
[1:02:30] what shall we do that we might work the
[1:02:32] works of God you know what Jesus's
[1:02:35] response was this is the work of God
[1:02:37] that ye believe on him whom he hath
[1:02:42] sent well I thought the works of God
[1:02:45] were building hospitals I thought the
[1:02:47] works of God was feeding the
[1:02:51] poor that's nothing against that but the
[1:02:54] real works of God is to believe on him
[1:02:57] who he has
[1:03:00] sent in Zechariah 14:6 we see the
[1:03:04] prophecy laid forth and I want to go
[1:03:05] over just some basic fundamentals some
[1:03:07] of them here this evening because I know
[1:03:10] there's new ones amongst us and it's
[1:03:11] always good to Bear rehearsing yes in
[1:03:14] Zechariah 14 it's a scripture that was
[1:03:17] laying there for hundreds and hundreds
[1:03:19] of years it says in verse six and it
[1:03:21] shall come to pass in that day that the
[1:03:23] light shall not be clear nor dark but it
[1:03:26] shall be one day which shall be known to
[1:03:28] the Lord not day nor
[1:03:30] night but it shall come to pass that at
[1:03:34] the evening time it shall be
[1:03:38] light now that prophecy was in this
[1:03:41] Bible for hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:03:43] but now that God sent a message that was
[1:03:46] the manifestation of that
[1:03:49] scripture we could literally get our
[1:03:51] finger on the on that scripture in the
[1:03:53] Bible and say this day that scripture
[1:03:56] has been
[1:03:57] fulfilled and there's
[1:03:59] justification upon believing
[1:04:02] that and there's condemnation upon
[1:04:05] disbelieving
[1:04:07] that in Luke
[1:04:09] 1724 for as the lightning what is the
[1:04:12] lightning it's the Sun the light as it
[1:04:15] as as the lightning lith out of one part
[1:04:18] under the heaven shineth into the other
[1:04:20] part un under heaven so shall also the
[1:04:23] son of man be in his day right
[1:04:27] then he begins to get the days of Noah
[1:04:30] and he begins to typen for his day and
[1:04:31] in verse 30 even thus shall it be when
[1:04:35] the son of man is
[1:04:38] revealed as the sun went rises in the
[1:04:41] East see Jesus was a very simple man he
[1:04:46] was God but he was hiding his Simplicity
[1:04:48] he could sit and he could sit on a rock
[1:04:50] with his disciples and begin to talk
[1:04:51] about a sewer went forth to
[1:04:53] se he say whenever the clouds are red
[1:04:56] and lowering you say this and whenever
[1:04:59] it's this color you say this and it's so
[1:05:02] and then he look up and say as the sun
[1:05:03] rises in the East and sets in the west
[1:05:06] so shall the coming of the son of man be
[1:05:08] he would get on the on the level of
[1:05:09] Nature and you see the same Jesus Christ
[1:05:11] in this message begin to take a seed the
[1:05:14] spoken word is the Original Seed and
[1:05:17] begin to look at a wheat plant or begin
[1:05:18] to look at a corn stock and be able to
[1:05:20] preach the church age from the churches
[1:05:22] and how Jesus had to die except the corn
[1:05:25] of wheat fall on the ground that's
[1:05:27] language that we all
[1:05:30] understand because we understand that
[1:05:32] when you plant a seed it literally has
[1:05:34] to die and burst forth to reproduce
[1:05:37] itself in a multiplied
[1:05:39] form so as the corn comes up it's a type
[1:05:42] of the church and as it gets stronger
[1:05:44] and stronger and then by the time it
[1:05:46] gets to the ear of the Corn it's to
[1:05:48] reflect what was put in the
[1:05:50] ground the bride Ministry now reflects
[1:05:53] what was put in the ground
[1:05:56] amen so see it's God hiding in
[1:05:59] Simplicity that is God revealing himself
[1:06:02] he hides himself in Simplicity and then
[1:06:04] he reveals himself in the in the same so
[1:06:07] we see as the gospel when Jesus came it
[1:06:10] was there in the Middle East and then
[1:06:11] after he after the day of Pentecost it
[1:06:13] was geographically you can literally
[1:06:16] this is simple you can literally get a
[1:06:18] map get a globe and you can see where
[1:06:20] Jesus was and his disciples and where
[1:06:22] Paul was in Asia Minor and it was in the
[1:06:24] East and the gospel went there but then
[1:06:27] the gospel began as God began to unfold
[1:06:30] himself to the
[1:06:31] Gentiles it began to move further
[1:06:35] west so after Paul whenever that
[1:06:37] Antichrist Spirit came in in the church
[1:06:39] ages they went through the Dark Ages it
[1:06:42] was moving a little further west well
[1:06:43] all of a sudden Martin Luther caught
[1:06:45] that the just shall live by faith he was
[1:06:47] further
[1:06:48] west he was in Germany
[1:06:52] Europe and then what came after that
[1:06:54] then come John Wesley with
[1:06:55] sanctification even further
[1:06:57] west the prophet said it crossed the
[1:07:00] English Channel into England and then
[1:07:02] from there the Pentecostals on the west
[1:07:04] Co in in America the
[1:07:07] west where did the pro where did God
[1:07:09] have his Prophet go meet seven
[1:07:13] angels in the
[1:07:15] west so far west that if you go any
[1:07:18] further west you're back East again so
[1:07:20] did the gospel in fact move from the
[1:07:23] East to the West exactly like Jesus said
[1:07:26] we're living in that
[1:07:31] manifestation because just like
[1:07:33] Naturally Speaking if you got the July
[1:07:36] Sun you we some of us are planting
[1:07:40] gardens if right now if next week the
[1:07:43] July Sun sprung forth the strength of
[1:07:45] that sun it would kill your
[1:07:49] garden but God has got the season so
[1:07:52] laid out so perfectly that the strength
[1:07:54] of the Sun is there for what's needed
[1:07:57] because when you're when the corn or the
[1:07:58] wheat is ready to be harvested you can't
[1:08:01] have the weak May or February Sun you
[1:08:04] need the the strength of the sun needs
[1:08:06] to match the stage of the
[1:08:09] crop so now that we've come through all
[1:08:11] these seven Church ages and God has sent
[1:08:13] a message and he shine forth in the
[1:08:15] strength of his son s o n the Lord Jesus
[1:08:19] Christ in the fullness of the word with
[1:08:20] all Seven Seals open what are we doing
[1:08:23] we're laying in the presence of the son
[1:08:25] to ripen to mature the shuck has pulled
[1:08:30] away that was Pentecost they pull away
[1:08:33] so now the real seed is laying in the
[1:08:36] presence of the sun waiting for what to
[1:08:38] go to the
[1:08:40] Garner the full
[1:08:43] strength praise the Lord
[1:08:46] Jesus because we cannot have Luther's
[1:08:50] sunlight for a body
[1:08:52] change we can't have Wesley's light for
[1:08:55] for a body change we need stronger light
[1:08:58] we can't have the Pentecostal light for
[1:09:00] a body change we needed the so wind we
[1:09:04] needed the rising of the sun to be in
[1:09:07] its
[1:09:08] fullness because we need a body change
[1:09:11] we needed a Rapture
[1:09:16] message the message of Luther was light
[1:09:19] for that day and there's bride right now
[1:09:22] in the presence of God that believe that
[1:09:24] light
[1:09:26] right but because like Jesus said if you
[1:09:30] continue in my word then are you my
[1:09:33] disciples indeed so whenever God moved
[1:09:35] on to Wesley but people are like no I I
[1:09:38] don't know Wesley I don't believe it
[1:09:39] we've got Luther we know the just shall
[1:09:41] live by faith that's right but God then
[1:09:43] moved on to
[1:09:45] Wesley so if you were a real disciple
[1:09:48] you'd continue in his word to
[1:09:50] Wesley and then from Wesley they moved
[1:09:52] on to the restoration of the gifts well
[1:09:54] we don't believe in the gifts because
[1:09:55] we've got sanctification that's all we
[1:09:58] need God you can't put God in a
[1:10:03] box to have light and darkness you have
[1:10:06] to be where the pillar of fire is when
[1:10:09] it moves you
[1:10:10] move that's what God even told them he
[1:10:13] said and the Lord went before them by
[1:10:15] day in a pillar of cloud to lead them
[1:10:16] the way and by night in a pillar of fire
[1:10:18] to give them light to go by day and by
[1:10:20] night he took not away the pillar of
[1:10:23] cloud by day nor the pill pillar Fire by
[1:10:25] night from before the
[1:10:27] people you could have just gotten your
[1:10:29] tent all set up man you were comfortable
[1:10:32] you're about to eat supper brother Adam
[1:10:35] you your wife just cooked you the your
[1:10:37] favorite
[1:10:38] dish but that you you look out your
[1:10:41] window and that Pillar of Fire is
[1:10:43] moving what are you going to
[1:10:45] do eat cold food you got to
[1:10:50] move you've got to move when the pillar
[1:10:53] of fire moves you better move with it
[1:10:56] [Applause]
[1:10:57] but see in in the form of a church
[1:11:01] that's that's why we have
[1:11:03] denominations do you understand that's
[1:11:06] why we have denominations because they
[1:11:08] Camp around the pillar of fire moved on
[1:11:10] and said no we're going to stay right
[1:11:12] here and that's why we have a Lutheran
[1:11:16] Church we have a Methodist Church
[1:11:18] because when God moved from John Wesley
[1:11:21] when God did the work through him and
[1:11:22] moved on and restored the gifts they
[1:11:24] said nope we're staying right
[1:11:26] here and God left them
[1:11:31] there Psalm 11915 says Thy word is a
[1:11:35] lamp unto my feet and a light unto my
[1:11:39] path if you want to know how to walk you
[1:11:41] bet you we need to be in the
[1:11:43] light now in Matthew chapter 17 Jesus is
[1:11:47] vindicating both John the Baptist and
[1:11:49] brother brandham do you know Jesus
[1:11:51] literally mentioned brother
[1:11:53] brandham he talked about his
[1:11:55] Ministry in St joh excuse me in Matthew
[1:11:58] 17:10 and his disciples asked him saying
[1:12:02] why then say the scribes that Elijah
[1:12:04] must first come and Jesus answered and
[1:12:06] said unto them Elijah truly
[1:12:10] shall first come and restore all
[1:12:13] things Hallelujah but I say unto you
[1:12:17] that Elijah is come
[1:12:19] already and they knew him not but have
[1:12:22] done unto him whatsoever they listed
[1:12:26] likewise also likewise shall also the
[1:12:28] son of man suffer of them then the
[1:12:30] disciples understood that he spake to
[1:12:33] them of John the Baptist Elijah truly
[1:12:37] shall come and restore all things and
[1:12:41] John the
[1:12:42] Baptist has already
[1:12:47] come he knew brother Brandon was coming
[1:12:51] right of course he did and how does that
[1:12:54] make us feel to be able brother Jordan
[1:12:56] to be able to look in that and say God
[1:12:57] has given me to ear given me a hear to
[1:13:01] ear an ear to
[1:13:04] hear God has given me an ear to hear
[1:13:08] what the spirit said I heard the Elijah
[1:13:12] that shall come here I am I'm a product
[1:13:14] of his
[1:13:17] ministry now every beautiful prophecy
[1:13:20] that you that we read of Jesus in the
[1:13:21] Old Testament had no redeeming power to
[1:13:24] it until until it became
[1:13:26] flesh Isaiah 53 Isaiah 96 all them
[1:13:29] beautiful prophecies and and things
[1:13:32] could not redeem heal or save in
[1:13:36] Prophecy
[1:13:37] form people were holding on to it they
[1:13:40] kept believing they kept waiting for it
[1:13:41] waiting for it but as soon as one day
[1:13:43] that Isaiah
[1:13:47] 53 was going down a cobble a Roman
[1:13:51] cobblestone street right with a cross on
[1:13:54] his back
[1:13:56] that meant
[1:13:58] something when the prophecy of Isaiah 53
[1:14:01] in flesh was tied to a whipping Co a
[1:14:03] post and beat to an absolute
[1:14:06] unrecognizable pulp that did something
[1:14:08] for you that did something for me when
[1:14:12] that prophecy hung on the cross and said
[1:14:14] it is finished that did something for
[1:14:16] you that did something for
[1:14:19] me when that Roman spear was thrust into
[1:14:22] his precious side that bought my new
[1:14:27] birth the potential was there and all
[1:14:30] the power and everything that this word
[1:14:35] held it was bound with Seven
[1:14:38] Seals it was there in potential power
[1:14:41] form but it couldn't be released to the
[1:14:49] church until the Seven Seals were broken
[1:14:53] right
[1:14:55] then all the power behind this word is
[1:14:58] in you right if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:15:01] all the power all of Heaven brother Ram
[1:15:04] said is behind this
[1:15:07] word just like all the redeeming power
[1:15:10] behind Jesus came into effect when he
[1:15:13] became flesh and salvation became a
[1:15:16] reality when he gave his life and he
[1:15:18] said it is finished then it went from
[1:15:20] prophecy to reality then we could
[1:15:22] benefit from it
[1:15:25] so all this prophecy about the son of
[1:15:27] man coming and and thus shall it be when
[1:15:30] the son of man is revealed and behold
[1:15:31] I'll send Elijah the prophet unto you it
[1:15:33] was a promise it was a seed it was a
[1:15:35] wonderful promise but now it's been
[1:15:38] manifested now the seals have been torn
[1:15:40] off and now you're told come look come
[1:15:44] and see come eat of this Tree of
[1:15:48] Life come eat it now the Seven Seals are
[1:15:52] more than just horse riders right amen
[1:15:55] because see the the seals reveal
[1:15:58] Christ the horse riders are the spirit
[1:16:01] of antichrist or is
[1:16:03] Satan so the seals expose the enemy but
[1:16:06] laying under the seals is Christ and
[1:16:10] under Christ is his bride you're in
[1:16:14] there when one of these brothers get up
[1:16:16] and they preach predestination that's
[1:16:18] preaching from an unsealed
[1:16:20] book and you say glory to God I've been
[1:16:24] predestinated my natural birth could
[1:16:26] keep me from this word that's you
[1:16:28] hearing your name in the
[1:16:30] book when water baptism is is preached
[1:16:33] correct water baptism in the name of the
[1:16:35] Lord Jesus Christ is preached that's
[1:16:37] from an open
[1:16:39] book it's still the seals being preached
[1:16:43] because when the seals were broken all
[1:16:45] the mystery truths were
[1:16:47] uncovered sure some some small groups
[1:16:49] had had the true baptism name because
[1:16:52] they had
[1:16:53] part but God sent a prophet in this end
[1:16:56] time to and reveal all the
[1:16:59] seals and now this bride Ministry around
[1:17:02] the world when she gets up and the
[1:17:04] ministers get up and anointed and given
[1:17:06] a sermon inspired by almighty God that
[1:17:09] is the opening of the word to
[1:17:13] you because the bride is bone of his
[1:17:16] bone flesh of his
[1:17:22] flesh that's why the token could only be
[1:17:24] preached after the
[1:17:27] seals that's why that was the highlight
[1:17:29] of the message despite everything the
[1:17:32] devil tells you you're
[1:17:34] okay if you have the new birth you're
[1:17:36] okay and if you don't have the new birth
[1:17:39] don't you stop until you get
[1:17:44] it in John one that which was from the
[1:17:47] beginning which we've heard which we've
[1:17:48] seen with our eyes which we've looked
[1:17:50] Upon Our Hands have handled of the word
[1:17:54] of life
[1:17:55] for the life was manifested and we've
[1:17:57] seen it and bear witness and show unto
[1:17:58] you that eternal life which was with the
[1:18:01] father it was manifested unto us that's
[1:18:03] God condescending they begin to handle
[1:18:06] the word of
[1:18:07] life no matter how much chaos was in the
[1:18:11] world when light shined it put
[1:18:14] everything in its
[1:18:17] place Rahab if you want to talk about
[1:18:21] chaos you think about Rahab
[1:18:25] there was a lot of dirt that Satan threw
[1:18:27] on her
[1:18:29] life but no matter how much dirt that he
[1:18:32] kept trying to dump on her life dump on
[1:18:34] her life dump on her life she still came
[1:18:39] forth in Psalm 139 David speaking where
[1:18:43] shall I go from thy Spirit or whether
[1:18:46] shall I flee from thy presence think of
[1:18:49] this when you're an ordained sister
[1:18:52] Deborah when you are an elected child of
[1:18:54] God where can you
[1:18:57] go and be away from his
[1:19:01] presence it doesn't matter if it was
[1:19:04] while you were in sin or now that you've
[1:19:07] got the Holy Ghost it doesn't matter
[1:19:08] you've never been out of his
[1:19:11] watch David said if I Ascend up into
[1:19:14] heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed
[1:19:16] in hell behold Thou Art there if I take
[1:19:18] the wings of the morning and dwell in
[1:19:20] the uttermost parts of the
[1:19:22] sea even there shall thy hand lead me
[1:19:26] and thy right hand shall hold me if I
[1:19:28] say surely the darkness of sin let's say
[1:19:32] shall cover
[1:19:33] me even the night shall be light about
[1:19:39] me when you are in your darkest sinful
[1:19:44] State he can still see that elected seed
[1:19:47] in
[1:19:49] you because Darkness and Light is the
[1:19:52] same to God
[1:19:54] no matter how dark and and how much you
[1:19:58] know to Hell Satan took
[1:20:00] you God still seen you as his
[1:20:04] child yay the darkness hideth not from
[1:20:07] thee but the night shineth as the day
[1:20:09] the darkness and the light are both
[1:20:11] alike unto thee do you know the prophet
[1:20:14] said that Rahab was actually forced into
[1:20:17] prostitution by her own
[1:20:20] parents she was a beautiful young girl
[1:20:23] and they were pagans and they needed an
[1:20:26] income you think about
[1:20:29] that that's
[1:20:32] terrible but that was Satan but yet in
[1:20:35] spite of all that whenever The
[1:20:38] Messengers came into Jericho she
[1:20:42] believed she didn't ask to see Moses's
[1:20:44] Rod where you where they turned into a
[1:20:46] snake they didn't ask she didn't ask to
[1:20:47] see a bottle of fleas that maybe were
[1:20:49] created she believed everything that
[1:20:51] Moses said and then she believed the
[1:20:54] Joshua a
[1:20:55] Ministry and she said give me a sure
[1:21:00] token all she did she heard but now
[1:21:03] she's
[1:21:05] seen and you look at with her past and
[1:21:08] everything that happened yet she still
[1:21:11] wanted her parents
[1:21:13] saved she still exercised forgiveness in
[1:21:16] her heart to
[1:21:18] say I want my family in I want my mom I
[1:21:21] want my dad in
[1:21:25] yeah for her
[1:21:27] household she had to find forgiveness in
[1:21:30] her
[1:21:31] heart and then we know that she was
[1:21:33] actually married to an Israeli General
[1:21:38] salmone and then they had Boaz together
[1:21:42] you think of the grace of
[1:21:45] God a girl that lived that lifestyle not
[1:21:48] by
[1:21:49] choice yet God through that Darkness
[1:21:52] could still see the light that was on
[1:21:54] the inside of of her grafted her as it
[1:21:57] were into the nation of
[1:21:59] Israel and
[1:22:00] then they had a
[1:22:03] baby and it wasn't just any
[1:22:06] baby it was
[1:22:09] Boaz here she was the reality her past
[1:22:13] didn't
[1:22:15] matter she would believe the word for
[1:22:17] her day that justified
[1:22:20] her and she here she was holding a type
[1:22:24] of
[1:22:25] Christ into the lineage the natural
[1:22:28] lineage of our Lord Jesus
[1:22:31] Christ because remember Boaz typed the
[1:22:37] Redeemer we're reading the book of Ruth
[1:22:39] here with the with the kids not long ago
[1:22:41] and we got to just kind of discussing it
[1:22:43] it just kind of made me see A New
[1:22:45] Perspective on it you know whenever Ruth
[1:22:46] and and orpa whenever they married them
[1:22:49] boys and they ended up dying and we're
[1:22:50] familiar with the story yet Ruth had a
[1:22:53] drive in her that she wanted to go with
[1:22:57] Naomi and I just kind of wonder what if
[1:23:00] it was her husbands that told her her
[1:23:02] husband that told her all about the
[1:23:04] great Jehovah oh yeah how they came
[1:23:07] through the Red Sea and how they came
[1:23:08] through the promised land and how Joshua
[1:23:10] came and divided the land but here they
[1:23:12] were in Moab and her husband was taken
[1:23:15] off the scene yet she there was such a
[1:23:17] thirst that got ignited in her that
[1:23:19] whenever she was given the option to go
[1:23:21] back she said where you go I will go
[1:23:27] because she was
[1:23:29] predestinated so Rahab became a queen
[1:23:32] among women in the nation of
[1:23:34] Israel because of who she produced Boaz
[1:23:38] right and if a Scarlet thread if
[1:23:41] believing Joshua and a Scarlet thread as
[1:23:43] a token and and and what it did for her
[1:23:46] what would the blood of Jesus Christ do
[1:23:47] for you what does the blood of Jesus
[1:23:50] Christ do for me
[1:23:56] Justified that is a powerful
[1:24:00] thing in Romans 51 Paul speaking said
[1:24:03] therefore being justified by faith we
[1:24:06] have peace through God through our Lord
[1:24:08] Jesus
[1:24:10] Christ being justified by
[1:24:15] faith now when you're
[1:24:18] Justified that's not just
[1:24:23] forgiven Justified is
[1:24:26] literally as though you've never done
[1:24:29] it and we're going to we're going to get
[1:24:32] into some wonderful things about
[1:24:34] justification in Colossians chapter 2
[1:24:36] and you being dead in verse 13 and you
[1:24:39] being dead in your sins and the Earth
[1:24:40] circumcision of your flesh hath he
[1:24:42] quickened together with him having
[1:24:44] forgiven you all trespasses blotting out
[1:24:47] the handwriting of ordinances that was
[1:24:49] against us which was contrary to us took
[1:24:52] it out of the way nailing it to his
[1:24:55] cross brother Randy he literally blotted
[1:24:59] out the handwriting that was against
[1:25:02] us because remember there's an old
[1:25:05] account and Satan's a good
[1:25:09] bookkeeper he's a good
[1:25:12] recordkeeper and he likes he likes to
[1:25:15] record all he he'll he'll set a
[1:25:17] trap he he likes to record your mistakes
[1:25:20] and then thumb back through them and say
[1:25:22] mhm look here this was on let's see
[1:25:25] April the 1st
[1:25:28] [Music]
[1:25:30] 19
[1:25:33] 88 and he's he's a Record
[1:25:36] Keeper but so is my
[1:25:39] God Satan's record don't matter
[1:25:43] nothing because the Bible says in Romans
[1:25:46] 8 moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:25:50] he also called and whom he called them
[1:25:53] he also justif ified and whom he
[1:25:55] justified them he also
[1:25:59] glorified it's a finished
[1:26:01] work we're walking into
[1:26:04] it now see there's to get to the New
[1:26:08] Birth there's three
[1:26:10] stages there's
[1:26:13] justification there's
[1:26:16] sanctification and then there's the Holy
[1:26:19] Ghost so the first thing you have an
[1:26:22] inclination toward God and you repent of
[1:26:24] everything you can think of and you take
[1:26:26] on the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:28] Christ and God forgives you you you do
[1:26:32] it sincerely you do it with a broken
[1:26:34] heart and God forgives
[1:26:37] you but then what happens is you keep
[1:26:40] making the same mistakes and you keep
[1:26:42] asking God to forgive you he does you
[1:26:45] make another
[1:26:46] mistake God forgives you so then you
[1:26:49] have to cry out to the Lord to be
[1:26:52] Sanctified because when you fall into
[1:26:54] into the same cycle you need to
[1:26:56] literally be Sanctified from that
[1:26:59] cycle so then you you pray and you say
[1:27:02] God I'm tired of this catching me every
[1:27:04] time I'm tired of falling over this same
[1:27:07] thing I need you to actually take it out
[1:27:09] of my heart I need you to take the
[1:27:11] desire of this out of my
[1:27:16] heart and you you you keep in fellowship
[1:27:19] with Believers and you keep crying out
[1:27:20] to God and God will do
[1:27:22] it because promised amen so then you're
[1:27:27] Sanctified I don't have a desire to
[1:27:29] drink anymore I don't have a desire to
[1:27:32] lust anymore I don't have a desire of
[1:27:34] this I don't I don't lie anymore that
[1:27:36] just God took it away from me overnight
[1:27:38] God Sanctified you but don't you
[1:27:42] stop don't you stop it's then you have
[1:27:45] to ask God to fill
[1:27:47] you to fill you with the Holy Ghost with
[1:27:50] he
[1:27:52] himself with a very presence of God
[1:27:55] indwelling
[1:27:56] you then you become a holy ghost Born
[1:28:00] Again child of God you're a child of God
[1:28:03] during that process
[1:28:05] too but see the the problem is that
[1:28:09] people get
[1:28:10] Justified and that's
[1:28:12] it and they'll never be able to break a
[1:28:15] cycle they'll never be able to overcome
[1:28:17] something because they're just Justified
[1:28:18] God forgive me God forgives them the
[1:28:20] next day God forgives them God forgives
[1:28:23] them but God intends for you to then go
[1:28:25] on to
[1:28:26] sanctification yes Lord and then when
[1:28:28] you're all cleaned out and you're all
[1:28:29] scoured
[1:28:31] out Jesus taught on this remember he
[1:28:35] said when the unclean spirits come out
[1:28:36] go out of a man they walk in dry places
[1:28:40] and then they come back trying to get
[1:28:41] back in that is why after a person gets
[1:28:45] Sanctified you want to stay there and
[1:28:46] desperately cry for the Holy
[1:28:49] Ghost
[1:28:51] right but now in Romans when ever it
[1:28:54] says whom he did predestinate them he
[1:28:56] also called and whom he called them he
[1:28:57] justified and whom he justified them he
[1:28:58] glorified that's what God already done
[1:29:01] for you right you're just walking into
[1:29:04] it by his
[1:29:06] grace this isn't like where people drop
[1:29:08] off in justification or drop off in
[1:29:10] sanctification he's already done
[1:29:14] it if you're predestinated to be
[1:29:16] glorified then you're predestinated to
[1:29:18] be justified you're already called you
[1:29:19] already elected you're already placed he
[1:29:21] did all that but it starts with the ho
[1:29:24] Holy
[1:29:27] Ghost by believing the word of your day
[1:29:30] and not just you know we hear it and man
[1:29:33] I believe that like I believe it like
[1:29:35] it's something like yeah that's the
[1:29:37] truth yep it is but we've got to see it
[1:29:40] live in our
[1:29:42] lives we've got that's what being a
[1:29:44] Christian is being a Christian is not
[1:29:47] enough to say that's the
[1:29:50] truth that's the Son of God I I believe
[1:29:54] God sent a prophet yep
[1:29:58] absolutely but whenever it becomes a
[1:30:01] living
[1:30:03] reality remember that story brother Ron
[1:30:04] you said that when you were weren't
[1:30:06] living right you got in a fight with a
[1:30:08] man over the Vindication of a
[1:30:12] prophet but it wasn't living in him
[1:30:16] yet that's the
[1:30:19] difference because remember the Bible
[1:30:21] said being confident you got to be
[1:30:23] confident in this very thing that he
[1:30:24] which hath begun a good work in you will
[1:30:27] perform it until the day of Jesus
[1:30:32] Christ what shall we then say to these
[1:30:34] things if God be for us who can be
[1:30:36] against us what Satan has on you don't
[1:30:40] matter because really it's on
[1:30:44] him he that spared not his own son but
[1:30:46] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[1:30:49] not with him also freely give us all
[1:30:50] things who shall lay anything to the
[1:30:54] charge of God's elect it is God that
[1:30:59] justifieth who is he that condemneth it
[1:31:02] is Christ that died y rather that is
[1:31:04] risen again who is even at the right
[1:31:05] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[1:31:08] for us the devil didn't die for you the
[1:31:11] devil can't die for
[1:31:14] you Jesus Christ died for you so why
[1:31:16] would we listen to what the devil brings
[1:31:20] up his books are not accurate
[1:31:24] he's not a good bookkeeper he he records
[1:31:27] yeah but once our sin is dipped into the
[1:31:32] precious blood of Jesus
[1:31:35] Christ he said now your old book is gone
[1:31:38] with your old Union God put it in the
[1:31:41] sea of his
[1:31:44] forgetfulness you stand
[1:31:47] perfectly before
[1:31:50] God perfectly before God
[1:31:57] now your name is now in the new book not
[1:32:00] the book of life but the Lamb's Book of
[1:32:02] Life what the lamb
[1:32:05] redeemed because we have two
[1:32:08] books the first book is our natural
[1:32:10] birth that's what we want put in the sea
[1:32:12] of God's
[1:32:14] forgetfulness it's not in the sea of our
[1:32:16] forgetfulness we don't have
[1:32:18] that it ain't the SE if the devil's
[1:32:20] forgetfulness he ain't going to forget
[1:32:22] it and he's is going to do everything he
[1:32:24] can to make sure we don't but whose
[1:32:27] Vision are we looking
[1:32:31] through he said your new life is in the
[1:32:33] Lamb's Book of Life your marriage
[1:32:35] certificate Hallelujah where your
[1:32:37] Eternal germ from the beginning takes
[1:32:40] hold now you're not only forgiven you're
[1:32:43] Justified right Glory he said Justified
[1:32:48] Look up the word the word don't mean
[1:32:50] forgiven the word means Justified it
[1:32:53] don't mean you're forgiven it's not just
[1:32:55] cuz if you're forgiven you actually did
[1:32:57] it but somebody forgave you of
[1:32:59] it but when you're Justified you never
[1:33:03] did
[1:33:06] it in the eyes of God you've never done
[1:33:13] it look at your neighbor and say I'm
[1:33:18] perfect and if you're sitting next to
[1:33:19] your spouse brother Vernon say it again
[1:33:25] now why are they laughing and shaking
[1:33:26] their
[1:33:28] heads because they don't see you with
[1:33:30] the same vision God sees you all the
[1:33:34] time because they because our spouses
[1:33:37] know each other we we know each other
[1:33:39] according to the
[1:33:41] flesh according to our human spirits but
[1:33:44] when we look Through The Eyes Of God he
[1:33:46] sees
[1:33:51] Perfection he sees perfection
[1:33:54] in Colossians 1:22 21 and you who were
[1:33:57] sometime alienated and enemies in your
[1:34:00] mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he
[1:34:02] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[1:34:04] through death to present you holy and
[1:34:07] unblamable and
[1:34:10] unreprovable in your own
[1:34:13] sight in his
[1:34:16] sight because if you are perfect in your
[1:34:19] own sight then that's called
[1:34:21] arrogance that's called Pride
[1:34:28] amen but it's about how he sees you
[1:34:32] right because he's the judge thank
[1:34:36] God so it's all about how he sees you
[1:34:39] and if he sees you perfect it don't
[1:34:41] matter what the Devil Himself sees you
[1:34:43] like he ain't your judge he's your
[1:34:46] accuser and the great judge is going to
[1:34:47] put him in the lake of fire with his
[1:34:49] record
[1:34:52] books that's where he's going with
[1:34:55] that it's important to see ourselves in
[1:34:57] the light of the
[1:34:59] word as God sees
[1:35:02] us we look we're also to examine
[1:35:04] ourselves that the Bible tells us and
[1:35:06] say Lord I see these
[1:35:08] imperfections I need you to help me see
[1:35:10] we judge ourselves not one
[1:35:13] another and God will work on
[1:35:17] you it's all about what God because what
[1:35:19] God sees is that's the real reality if
[1:35:23] God sees you healed you're healed
[1:35:26] Hallelujah if God sees you Holy Ghost
[1:35:27] filled you're Holy Ghost
[1:35:31] filled because remember the ladyo in
[1:35:33] church age sees itself as just the most
[1:35:36] beautiful thing the most spiritual thing
[1:35:38] and Revival and just such a have need of
[1:35:41] nothing isn't that what the Book of
[1:35:42] Revelation says they're inrich increase
[1:35:45] with goods and have need of nothing
[1:35:46] they've got it going
[1:35:48] on but look how God sees them wretched
[1:35:52] miserable blind blind and
[1:35:57] naked so just as the Holy Ghost when the
[1:36:01] Holy Ghost comes into you it makes you
[1:36:04] so completely dead to
[1:36:07] sin there'll be Temptations sure if
[1:36:10] you'll make mistakes sure but the desire
[1:36:13] for sin has completely been burned out
[1:36:15] of
[1:36:20] you the token is positive proof that God
[1:36:24] has accepted your faith right in his
[1:36:27] sacrifice the bleeding word when he
[1:36:30] seals you with the Holy Ghost that shows
[1:36:32] it is a finished work and it's literally
[1:36:35] stricken from the books of
[1:36:38] God and Satan is going to burn in the
[1:36:40] lake of fire with all of his
[1:36:44] accusations and he knows it's
[1:36:48] coming now back to the difference
[1:36:51] between forgiven and Justified he said
[1:36:52] for instance you heard I got drunk and
[1:36:55] did some evil things and everything then
[1:36:56] you come around say to me you find out I
[1:36:58] didn't do them then you come around and
[1:36:59] say brother brandom I forgive you he
[1:37:00] says forgive me I never got
[1:37:04] drunk he said now if I did do it I'm
[1:37:07] guilty but you can forgive me and but he
[1:37:10] said but yet I'm not justified because I
[1:37:13] actually done
[1:37:15] it now I do believe that a sincere
[1:37:18] nominal Christian sincere that that they
[1:37:21] find forgiveness for their sins amen
[1:37:24] am I I would love to to hear I love
[1:37:27] hearing testimonies of just people been
[1:37:29] delivered from a life of sin and there
[1:37:31] they're they're serving the lord of the
[1:37:32] best their ability God bless
[1:37:35] them but see we're talking about a
[1:37:38] church versus a
[1:37:40] bride before the opening of the word
[1:37:42] everybody thought that the church was
[1:37:43] one lump sum lump
[1:37:46] sum everybody thought it was just one
[1:37:49] the church the church but God revealed
[1:37:51] in this end time that there's a bride
[1:37:54] and a
[1:37:58] church and justification being sinless
[1:38:02] justified only comes through the token
[1:38:04] life of Jesus
[1:38:06] Christ it only comes through believing
[1:38:09] the word of your
[1:38:10] day justification in the sense of being
[1:38:13] totally sinless in the sight of God only
[1:38:17] comes through believ in the word of your
[1:38:20] day because that's the only way the Holy
[1:38:23] Ghost
[1:38:24] come you remember brother talking about
[1:38:26] that drop of ink going in the bleach and
[1:38:29] it's so destroyed it goes back to its
[1:38:31] origination it can't be found
[1:38:34] anymore and the prophet of God said all
[1:38:36] of your sins go back to the devil from
[1:38:39] where it originated
[1:38:43] from in John
[1:38:45] 3:16 let's read Verse 18 He that
[1:38:48] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[1:38:52] that believeth not is condemned already
[1:38:54] because he hath not believed in the name
[1:38:57] of the only begotten Son of God and this
[1:39:00] is the condemnation that light is come
[1:39:03] into the world and Men love Darkness
[1:39:06] rather than
[1:39:08] light that's the
[1:39:10] condemnation do you know it's a lot
[1:39:12] harder to go to hell than it is to
[1:39:14] Heaven if you really think about it I
[1:39:16] never once heard the prophet of God say
[1:39:18] you got to fight your way to
[1:39:20] heaven but you have to fight your way to
[1:39:22] hell right because when when because to
[1:39:26] to be a Christian you you believe like
[1:39:29] he said he that believeth on him is not
[1:39:31] condemned but he that believeth not is
[1:39:35] condemned
[1:39:38] already in another place he Jesus
[1:39:40] himself speaking said if I had not come
[1:39:43] and spoken unto them they had not had
[1:39:47] sin now why would he make a statement
[1:39:49] like that because he was the word made
[1:39:53] fles
[1:39:54] flesh and he came and he was absolutely
[1:39:57] everything the Bible said he would
[1:39:59] be and his generation looked at him and
[1:40:03] refused him and killed
[1:40:07] him he said but now they have no cloak
[1:40:11] for their
[1:40:13] sin let's bring that on up to our day
[1:40:16] it's important that in our minds we not
[1:40:18] always think of Jesus Christ is always
[1:40:20] just 2,000 years ago he came what he's a
[1:40:24] very
[1:40:25] present he's the
[1:40:29] word and while while people carnal
[1:40:31] Believers in their mind may only think
[1:40:33] of him as being you know virgin born
[1:40:35] 2,000 years ago they can't see him of
[1:40:38] his work through the church they can't
[1:40:40] see they don't
[1:40:41] know but you've been made privy to
[1:40:44] it that he's actually came through a
[1:40:48] Vindicated prophet and now he's come
[1:40:49] through the through through the body of
[1:40:51] his
[1:40:52] bride she is
[1:40:55] him but see had they had this message
[1:40:59] not come the denominations would not
[1:41:01] have had sin because they wouldn't know
[1:41:04] any better but now that the word has
[1:41:06] come Jesus said they have no cloak for
[1:41:09] their
[1:41:12] sin because Jesus said be ye therefore
[1:41:14] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:41:18] heaven is
[1:41:20] perfect you think that can put if you
[1:41:23] don't have an understanding that can put
[1:41:24] a lot of pressure on you Jesus God
[1:41:26] himself saying you got to be
[1:41:29] perfect the prophet of God on the first
[1:41:31] seal said Jesus said be you therefore
[1:41:33] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[1:41:35] perfect and how could we even start the
[1:41:37] thought of being perfect but Jesus
[1:41:39] required it and if Jesus required it
[1:41:41] he's got to make a way for
[1:41:44] it aren't you happy to serve a loving
[1:41:46] God like that he'll make a requirement
[1:41:49] but then he'll make a
[1:41:51] way and he said said and he has his own
[1:41:57] blood now I'm not perfect in your sight
[1:41:59] you may not be perfect in my sight but
[1:42:01] what about in God's
[1:42:03] sight that's where it lays and if you're
[1:42:06] born again into the body of Christ and
[1:42:08] God looks upon you as a perfect as
[1:42:10] Christ was himself right amen and if
[1:42:16] you're born again in the body of Christ
[1:42:18] then God looks upon you as perfect as
[1:42:21] Christ was himself
[1:42:25] thank you're so perfect in the eyes of
[1:42:28] God if you have the Holy
[1:42:30] Ghost you're so perfect in the eyes of
[1:42:34] God you're going to
[1:42:36] miss the day of judgment that's
[1:42:40] right you're going to be there but
[1:42:42] you're going to be on this side of the
[1:42:45] Judgment
[1:42:47] bar because remember Christ was only
[1:42:49] smitten once isn't that how Moses got in
[1:42:52] trouble right brother Joel whenever
[1:42:54] Moses went and he he he got a temper he
[1:42:56] got his The Temper got the best of him
[1:42:58] and he and he smoked the rock twice but
[1:43:00] he he couldn't go into the promised land
[1:43:02] it was such a major
[1:43:04] deal Christ was the only smitten once so
[1:43:07] if the bride is the body of Christ and
[1:43:09] she's got to stand in judgment wouldn't
[1:43:11] he be smitten
[1:43:13] again he took our judgment for him he
[1:43:16] took our judgment for
[1:43:21] us if we we as the body of Christ had to
[1:43:24] be
[1:43:26] judged then that would be like Christ
[1:43:28] being smitten
[1:43:31] twice you think about
[1:43:34] that born in sin shaped in iniquity come
[1:43:37] to the world speaking lies yet there was
[1:43:39] a blood that was shed that was so
[1:43:42] powerful that brother Thomas every
[1:43:46] mistake that you've ever
[1:43:49] made is now cleaned off and God looks at
[1:43:51] you as perfect
[1:43:54] and then when come the day of judgment
[1:43:56] despite what the world thinks and how
[1:43:58] many how many you know that they they
[1:44:01] spread their ashes on the moon or send
[1:44:03] it to a rocket or whatever they're
[1:44:04] trying to do and Escape judgment they're
[1:44:06] going to resurrect and they're going to
[1:44:08] stand before God and give an
[1:44:10] account but yet there's been a blood
[1:44:13] because you accepted the
[1:44:16] word and God gave you the Holy Ghost and
[1:44:19] you're so Justified brother Jim that
[1:44:21] you'll actually be sitting with him in
[1:44:23] the Judgment as his
[1:44:28] Queen we judge ourselves as I said now
[1:44:31] by this
[1:44:32] word but God's going to have a glorious
[1:44:36] Church God's going to have a glorious
[1:44:38] church that he might present it to
[1:44:40] himself a glorious church not having
[1:44:41] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[1:44:44] that it should be holy and without
[1:44:47] blemish now in Matthew 25 if you'll put
[1:44:50] that up for me in verse 31 let's let's
[1:44:53] read
[1:44:55] this and when the son of man shall come
[1:44:58] in his glory and all the Holy Angels
[1:45:01] with him then shall he sit upon the
[1:45:03] throne of his glory and before him shall
[1:45:07] be gathered all nations and he shall
[1:45:09] separate them one from
[1:45:12] another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep
[1:45:15] from the
[1:45:17] goats now we're all expecting a body
[1:45:19] change in a
[1:45:20] Rapture before our bodies change
[1:45:23] change all the elected bride of Jesus
[1:45:27] Christ is going to resurrect first that
[1:45:30] is the first
[1:45:33] resurrection our bodies will then be
[1:45:36] changed you have the Holy Ghost and
[1:45:38] you're born again your body will be
[1:45:40] changed and we're going to meet the Lord
[1:45:42] Jesus in the
[1:45:44] air that's right now this scripture that
[1:45:48] we're reading is the second or also
[1:45:50] called the general Resurrection
[1:45:53] this is where righteous people come this
[1:45:55] is where Wicked people come this is
[1:45:57] where Hitler is going to come this is
[1:45:59] where Stalin's going to come this is
[1:46:01] where Cain's going to come all of
[1:46:03] them and then the good people
[1:46:06] too and on the day of judgment God's
[1:46:09] going to separate as sheep from the
[1:46:11] goats as we just read and he shall set
[1:46:13] the sheep on his right hand but the
[1:46:14] goats on the left then shall the king
[1:46:16] say unto them on his right hand Come Ye
[1:46:18] blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom
[1:46:20] prepared for you from the foundation of
[1:46:22] the world for for I wasn't hungered and
[1:46:25] he gave me meat I was thirsty and he
[1:46:28] gave me drink I was a stranger and he
[1:46:30] took me in naked and he clothed me I was
[1:46:32] sick and he visited me I was in prison
[1:46:34] and he came unto me then shall the
[1:46:35] righteous answer him saying Lord when
[1:46:38] saw we thee hungered and fed thee or
[1:46:41] thirsty and gave thee drink when saw he
[1:46:43] thee a stranger and took thee in or
[1:46:44] naked and clothed
[1:46:46] thee and the King shall answer and say
[1:46:48] unto them verily I say unto you in as
[1:46:52] much as ye have done it unto the least
[1:46:54] of these my brethren ye have done it
[1:46:56] unto
[1:46:58] me they didn't literally have to bring
[1:47:01] clothed Jesus but because they clothed
[1:47:04] you when you needed it God looks at you
[1:47:08] as
[1:47:09] himself whenever Saul or Paul when he
[1:47:11] was still Saul when he was coming down
[1:47:12] the road of Damascus and and he fell off
[1:47:14] his horse when he seen the pillar of
[1:47:16] fire what did Jesus tell them Paul or
[1:47:18] Saul Saul why persecutest thou me
[1:47:24] but he was killing
[1:47:25] Believers so see the body of Christ is
[1:47:28] like Christ himself right and there's
[1:47:31] going to be people on the day of
[1:47:32] judgment that's going to get Grace
[1:47:35] because of how their attitude was toward
[1:47:37] you and how they ministered to
[1:47:41] you that is why I say if you're on the
[1:47:43] workplace or something like that and
[1:47:44] somebody and a customer or a coworker
[1:47:46] tries to do something nice for you let
[1:47:48] them do
[1:47:51] it because you never know the reward
[1:47:54] attached with
[1:47:55] that you know the brother Ram said in
[1:47:57] the church AG book not getting brother
[1:47:59] Jeffrey not even getting someone a cold
[1:48:00] glass of water that's right in the name
[1:48:03] of the Lord God will reward you for
[1:48:09] that so God looks at you you're bought
[1:48:13] by his blood you're
[1:48:15] perfect and on the day of judgment
[1:48:17] brother Jerry you can say
[1:48:21] Lord that man did something for
[1:48:26] [Applause]
[1:48:31] me God is a god of
[1:48:33] mercy and sometimes when we preach this
[1:48:36] message it can maybe to people that
[1:48:37] don't understand it can seem so harsh
[1:48:39] like y'all think y'all are the only ones
[1:48:40] going no we're not the only ones going
[1:48:41] to heaven but to be in this bride you
[1:48:44] got to have an ear to hear this message
[1:48:46] that is a
[1:48:48] truth that will never be compromised on
[1:48:53] but there'll be millions of people going
[1:48:55] to heaven that are good
[1:48:59] people he said Paul brother R is quoting
[1:49:02] Paul here in 1 Corinthians 6 do you not
[1:49:03] know that the Saints shall judge the
[1:49:06] world and if the world shall be judged
[1:49:08] by you are you unworthy to judge the
[1:49:10] smallest matters know you not that we
[1:49:11] shall judge Angels how more of things
[1:49:14] that pertain to this life remember in
[1:49:16] the Book of Revelation Jesus said to him
[1:49:18] that
[1:49:19] overcometh will I grant him to sit with
[1:49:21] me in my throne right that's where
[1:49:24] judgment is as I have overcame and sat
[1:49:27] down in my father's
[1:49:29] Throne remember Jesus also talks about
[1:49:32] the queen of the
[1:49:33] South and he talks about whenever he's
[1:49:36] he's preaching to this generation he's
[1:49:38] performing the signs of the Messiah and
[1:49:39] they refuse him and he turns and he says
[1:49:42] the queen of the
[1:49:44] South will rise up with this generation
[1:49:47] and condemn
[1:49:48] it because she came from the uttermost
[1:49:51] parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of
[1:49:52] Solomon and behold a greater than
[1:49:55] Solomon is
[1:49:56] here the queen of the South will be
[1:49:59] sitting with the Lord Jesus in
[1:50:02] judgment and be able to say that I came
[1:50:05] from the uttermost parts of the earth to
[1:50:07] hear from a man with a gift of God in
[1:50:10] his
[1:50:14] life the men of Nineveh will stand in
[1:50:17] the judgment and condemn that same
[1:50:18] generation because Jonah came out of the
[1:50:21] belly of a fish
[1:50:23] and just in tyght preaching just the
[1:50:26] resurrection was just in tyght brother
[1:50:27] Gabriel just in tyght how much more when
[1:50:30] the son of man himself came and
[1:50:34] resurrected and they
[1:50:38] disbelieved when you remember when Jesus
[1:50:40] went to hell for the souls that didn't
[1:50:42] repent the long suffering days of of of
[1:50:45] Noah he didn't bring them a little Arc
[1:50:48] he didn't bring a little model and say
[1:50:50] why didn't you believe why didn't you
[1:50:51] get on here he he was the
[1:50:59] ark the bride will not go through the
[1:51:02] tribulation period amen thank you Lord
[1:51:05] the church WIll for its purification but
[1:51:07] not the
[1:51:11] bride he said notice these type the
[1:51:14] reason they die out they go through the
[1:51:15] purging of the trial of the tribulation
[1:51:18] because they're not actually under the
[1:51:21] blood that's right
[1:51:23] that's
[1:51:24] powerful they claim that they are but
[1:51:27] they're not how can they go through a
[1:51:29] trial to purify them when there is the
[1:51:31] bleach blood of Jesus Christ takes away
[1:51:33] every symptom and stuff away from you so
[1:51:36] if you're when you're fully when you're
[1:51:40] Justified God sees you as perfect what
[1:51:42] have you got to stand judgment for
[1:51:44] you're as perfect as Christ is he
[1:51:46] already took our
[1:51:47] judgment he's not going to be smitten
[1:51:50] again
[1:51:53] he took your
[1:51:54] judgment aren't you
[1:51:59] thankful he
[1:52:01] said and you're already dead and your
[1:52:04] life is hid in him through God and
[1:52:05] sealed in there by the Holy Ghost what
[1:52:07] are you going to be judged for where
[1:52:09] going to get your purification what do
[1:52:10] you have to be purified from when you're
[1:52:12] perfectly in Christ
[1:52:17] sinless but why do we why do we beat
[1:52:20] ourselves up sometimes over things is
[1:52:22] because the greatest battle ever
[1:52:26] fought that doesn't mean that it's God
[1:52:28] doing it that's the
[1:52:32] enemy that's when we have to take the
[1:52:34] word and say I'm Justified I'm perfect
[1:52:36] I'm
[1:52:40] sinless because he's going to judge the
[1:52:42] world remember you hear the prophet of
[1:52:45] God ring out all the time on tape he
[1:52:46] said if he's going to judge the World by
[1:52:48] something he's got to judge the World by
[1:52:50] a standard and that standard is Jesus
[1:52:52] Christ the
[1:52:53] word so that means that people will be
[1:52:56] judged according to their attitude
[1:52:57] toward the
[1:52:59] word because our attitude toward the
[1:53:02] word is our attitude toward Jesus Christ
[1:53:07] himself there's no
[1:53:10] difference I've got to
[1:53:15] hurry in St John 12:48 he said he that
[1:53:19] rejecteth me and receiveth not my words
[1:53:22] hath one that judgeth him the word that
[1:53:26] I have spoken the same shall judge him
[1:53:29] in the last
[1:53:31] day now when Jesus came the first time
[1:53:34] he came as a
[1:53:35] lamb he submitted himself to death he
[1:53:38] you know he came because he had to
[1:53:40] fulfill that sacrificial part but the
[1:53:43] second time he's come he's coming as
[1:53:48] judge same one different office
[1:53:54] brother raham tells a
[1:53:56] story about a
[1:53:59] cowboy he said there was there was a
[1:54:00] little baby in like a Buckboard wagon
[1:54:03] like they used to have and he was asleep
[1:54:05] or he was in there or whatever and all
[1:54:06] of a sudden a gunshot went off and this
[1:54:09] horse and this Buckboard wagon started
[1:54:11] tearing off through the countryside and
[1:54:13] was getting ready to go right over a
[1:54:15] cliff and right before went over this
[1:54:18] this Cliff brother Timothy a cow a young
[1:54:20] cowboy rode next to that horse and he
[1:54:22] grabed that horse by the rain and stop
[1:54:24] and save that baby's
[1:54:27] life years
[1:54:31] later that boy found made some wrong
[1:54:33] decisions and he found himself on trial
[1:54:36] for killing a
[1:54:38] man and there was a judge on the
[1:54:40] bench and after all the evidence and
[1:54:42] everything was laid out that judge
[1:54:45] looked at the law what was require and
[1:54:46] he said I sentence you to hang by your
[1:54:50] neck until this Mortal body until this
[1:54:52] Mortal life leaves your
[1:54:54] body and that man threw himself down and
[1:54:58] he be to cry and to beg with the judge
[1:55:00] and said
[1:55:01] judge don't you know
[1:55:04] me he said don't you know
[1:55:07] me and the judge looked down at him and
[1:55:09] said son I don't believe I
[1:55:13] do he said years ago I was a
[1:55:16] baby and a gunshot went off and I was
[1:55:19] you know being being taken to my death
[1:55:21] With a speeding horse you came and you
[1:55:23] saved me save me judge save
[1:55:25] me and that judge looked down at him and
[1:55:28] said
[1:55:29] son he said that day I was your
[1:55:32] savior he said but today I'm your
[1:55:37] judge we want to get it right
[1:55:40] now because let me tell you on the day
[1:55:43] of
[1:55:44] judgment right now we know each other
[1:55:46] according to the
[1:55:49] flesh but on the day of judgment it
[1:55:52] won't be Lord he's a good buddy of
[1:55:56] mine we really we really hung out and
[1:55:58] and and he's a good buddy of
[1:56:01] mine will then take on the will then be
[1:56:05] in judgment with
[1:56:07] him and when we hold the token over our
[1:56:10] prodigals now it's not just because of
[1:56:12] natural Association it's you've got the
[1:56:14] Holy Ghost you have the token and we're
[1:56:16] instructed to hold the token over our
[1:56:18] loved
[1:56:19] ones and we commit them to the Lord and
[1:56:21] we plead for their mercy and we believe
[1:56:24] they're going to be there and that's
[1:56:25] what we should do and that's what we'll
[1:56:26] always do but what I'm trying to tell
[1:56:29] you is on the day of judgment there'll
[1:56:30] be no human Association in the sense of
[1:56:36] Lord I I I know he didn't respect your
[1:56:38] word but let's just let him in because
[1:56:40] he's a good
[1:56:42] buddy it's the word the books will be
[1:56:46] open and the world will be judged by on
[1:56:50] what their attitude was towards this
[1:56:54] word now in the book in in
[1:56:58] Antiquity there was a sign whenever a
[1:57:01] king and I'm trying to wind this down
[1:57:02] whenever a
[1:57:04] king would come in on a donkey it was a
[1:57:08] symbol of
[1:57:09] peace that's how he would signify he's
[1:57:12] not there for war he's there for peace
[1:57:15] but when a king showed up on a horse you
[1:57:17] better watch
[1:57:19] out and the prophecy in Isaiah 9:9 says
[1:57:22] Rejoice greatly oh Daughter of Zion
[1:57:24] shout oh daughter of Jerusalem Behold
[1:57:26] thy King cometh unto thee he is just and
[1:57:29] having salvation he's lowly riding upon
[1:57:31] an ass and upon the cult the fo of an
[1:57:34] ass same King coming in
[1:57:38] peace he came to be our
[1:57:41] savior but now if you'll pull up
[1:57:43] Revelations
[1:57:45] 1911 look at the difference same
[1:57:50] God but now he com comes as judge and I
[1:57:54] saw heaven open and behold a white horse
[1:57:56] and see he's on a
[1:57:59] horse and he that sat on him was called
[1:58:01] faithful and true and in righteousness
[1:58:03] doth he judge and make
[1:58:06] war his eyes were as a flame of fire and
[1:58:09] on his heads were many crowns and he had
[1:58:11] a name written that no man knew but he
[1:58:13] himself and he was clothed with a
[1:58:15] vesture dipped in Blood and his name is
[1:58:18] called the word of God
[1:58:22] and the armies which were in heaven
[1:58:24] followed him upon white horses that's
[1:58:27] the
[1:58:28] bride clothed in fine linen white and
[1:58:31] clean spotless
[1:58:34] Justified and out of his mouth go with a
[1:58:37] sharp sword not out of his mouth goeth
[1:58:39] father forgive them for they know not
[1:58:41] what they
[1:58:42] do it's now turned at this point it's
[1:58:45] turned from Mercy to
[1:58:48] judgment and he shall rule them with a
[1:58:50] rod of iron and he treadeth the wine
[1:58:52] press of the fierceness of Wrath of
[1:58:53] almighty God and on and he hath on his
[1:58:56] vesture and on his thigh a name written
[1:58:58] king of kings and Lord of
[1:59:02] lords who appeared in this end
[1:59:07] time who was that are y'all able to pull
[1:59:09] up the cloud picture from
[1:59:13] Arizona when he appeared out west I want
[1:59:17] for us to remember it was not taken by
[1:59:20] Believers Believers didn't rush and say
[1:59:22] oh that that's the face of Christ let
[1:59:24] let me let me let me go take a quick
[1:59:26] picture scientists did
[1:59:29] that in the Houston Coliseum who took
[1:59:31] the picture of the pillar of fire
[1:59:37] critics critics took
[1:59:39] it but he's appeared because he's come
[1:59:43] to call his
[1:59:46] bride if we walk in the light as he is
[1:59:50] in the light we have have fellowship
[1:59:52] with one another and the blood of Jesus
[1:59:55] Christ cleanses
[1:59:56] us from all
[2:00:00] sin now when you keep reading the book
[2:00:02] of John and I'm I'm really trying to
[2:00:04] close but I don't want to leave you
[2:00:05] hanging
[2:00:08] here in John 1 John 1:8 I know I'm
[2:00:12] making you work up there I'm
[2:00:14] sorry it says if we say as you keep
[2:00:17] reading he says if we say that we have
[2:00:19] no sin we deceive ourselves and the
[2:00:20] truth is not in US if we confess our
[2:00:23] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[2:00:25] us our sins and to cleanse us from all
[2:00:27] unrighteousness if we say that we've not
[2:00:29] sinned we make him a liar and his word
[2:00:31] is not in us and that's not a
[2:00:34] contradiction in the
[2:00:35] Bible because remember sin is unbelief
[2:00:38] and when people do wrong they're
[2:00:40] attributes of sin they do that because
[2:00:42] they disbelieve in their heart so we as
[2:00:45] Christians make mistakes and we have
[2:00:47] sins that we've got to ask God to
[2:00:49] forgive us that we cover that we get
[2:00:51] covered by the blood
[2:00:54] but you've got to keep reading because
[2:00:57] remember whenever Paul Justified Abraham
[2:00:59] by his faith and then you have James
[2:01:01] comes and justifies him by his
[2:01:03] works and it looks like a contradiction
[2:01:05] in the Bible but brother Ram says that
[2:01:08] Paul was describing what God was saying
[2:01:12] and James was describing what man was
[2:01:13] saying because faith is Works
[2:01:16] expressed so when you read in 1 John
[2:01:18] chapter 3 you have to keep reading it
[2:01:20] says ye and ye know that he was
[2:01:23] manifested to take away our sins and in
[2:01:26] him is no sin whosoever abideth in him
[2:01:30] sinth
[2:01:32] not whosoever sinth hath not seen him
[2:01:35] neither known
[2:01:38] him little children let no man deceive
[2:01:41] you he that doeth righteousness is
[2:01:43] righteous even as he is righteous he
[2:01:45] that committeth sin is of the devil for
[2:01:47] the devil sinth from the beginning for
[2:01:49] this purpose the Son of God was
[2:01:51] manifested said that he might destroy
[2:01:54] the works of the
[2:01:56] devil 1 John 3:9 whosoever is born of
[2:01:59] God doth not commit
[2:02:03] sin that's not a
[2:02:05] contradiction because look what the next
[2:02:07] sentence says for his seed remaineth in
[2:02:12] him whose seed God's
[2:02:14] seed and he cannot sin because he's born
[2:02:18] of God
[2:02:25] in 1 John 5:18 for we know that
[2:02:27] whosoever is born of God sinth not but
[2:02:30] he that is begotten of God keepeth
[2:02:32] himself and that Wicked one toucheth him
[2:02:36] not amen let's stand
[2:02:41] tonight oh the precious blood of
[2:02:45] Jesus that cleanses us from all
[2:02:49] sin as Christians we of course as long
[2:02:51] as as we're still in these bodies we're
[2:02:52] going to make
[2:02:55] mistakes
[2:02:57] absolutely but yet we're without
[2:03:02] sin the prophet of God said how can a
[2:03:05] man say that the bride of Christ goes
[2:03:07] into the tribulation I can't understand
[2:03:10] it see she is took away from the
[2:03:13] tribulation if the church has been
[2:03:15] judged and they have been judged
[2:03:17] themselves and have accepted the blood
[2:03:20] how can God judge Jud a man that's
[2:03:24] perfectly totally
[2:03:28] sinless you say there's no such a person
[2:03:32] every Born Again believer True Believer
[2:03:35] is perfectly absolutely sinless before
[2:03:41] God you're
[2:03:44] sinless because the blood of Jesus
[2:03:47] Christ so cleanses us from sin
[2:03:52] her
[2:03:54] righteousness is his
[2:03:57] righteousness God has come in this end
[2:03:59] time
[2:04:01] Saints and he's proved himself beyond a
[2:04:05] shadow of a
[2:04:07] doubt there's no reason for this
[2:04:10] generation to
[2:04:12] disbelieve but they still did they still
[2:04:14] crucify the word didn't
[2:04:16] they Paul said oh foolish Galatians who
[2:04:19] hath Bewitched you that you should not
[2:04:21] obeyed the truth before whose eyes Jesus
[2:04:24] Christ hath been evidently set forth
[2:04:28] crucified among

[2:04:39] should obey not the truth before whose
[2:04:43] eyes Jesus Christ have been so evidently
[2:04:47] set crucified among you

[2:04:57] merciful if y'all if y'all can't get
[2:04:59] that picture that's okay I think we all
[2:05:00] know what it looks like but he's
