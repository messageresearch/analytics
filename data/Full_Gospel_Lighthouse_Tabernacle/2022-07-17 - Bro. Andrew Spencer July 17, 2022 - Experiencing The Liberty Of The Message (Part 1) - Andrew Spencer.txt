your life and you did it all with me on your mind [Music] it was me on your mind just knowing you're mindful of me just knowing you call me your child it's flooding my soul with unspeakable hope thank

you are for you paid the price and you took the cross and you gave your life and you did it all with me on your mind and that was me on your mind [Music] and i've read the words in red of a heavenly hormone high you're preparing a place where the sorrows erase em if i stand before you all fine all along it was me on your mind who am i that the king of the world would give one single thought about my broken heart who am i that the god for grace wipes the tears from my face and says come as you are for you gave your life and you took the cross and you gave your life and you did it all with me on your mind and it was me on your mind it was me on your mind yes it was me on your mind [Applause] i got a text this morning to sing a song i had on my heart maybe two i would sing but this one here kept coming to me i've never sung it about two years ago brother williams sent it to me i'd never heard it i wasn't capable of singing it then because it kind of overwhelms me he had no idea that how close to my life this song came i pray the lord help me through it this morning because not to give glory to that other thing but i just want to give praise to god for what he's done in my life i mean brother greg ain't never practiced it until just a while ago for about 30 minutes so it's fresh but brother greg happened to also bring up that after hearing this song he said you realize that two weeks before you started the church me and him got together at quaker state and we thought we done made a pack we're going to be drinking buddies little did we know we're going to drink but it wasn't rye yeah it's new wine so i just think that [Applause] i'd like for the devil to just take a look at the two that he thought he was getting a hold to that day where we're at now god had different plans the old man is dead [Music] now and then an old friend of mine i've not seen for some time stop by and ask me where i've been what's on my mind i wonder why i'm not drinking still painting this old town red i tell them i'm serving jesus now and the old man is dead [Music] and the man you see before you may look a lot the same i may wear the same clothes got the same last name but you're looking on the outside you could see inside instead you would see your brand new man cause the old man is dead [Music] i used to live such a wicked life i had no hope inside searching for [Music] after hearing what brother ron said [Music] i gave jesus and the man you see before you may look a lot the same i may wear the same clothes got the same last name [Music] you're looking on [Music] cause the old man is dead [Music] yes you're looking on the outside you could see inside and stay [Music] you would see a brand new man [Music] hallelujah hallelujah amen amen god bless you i hope you were singing standing for him amen you could be seated amen i love you with all my heart we were standing outside last night with brother jason smith and and brother brother danny and brother sean and our brother josh and we were talking about some of the things to be cut down on the side of the hill there and we were talking about different things and it was one weed that was there that looked a little bit on the funny side and i said i remember one time when i was a late teenager used that term late teenager that there was a helicopters that kept flying over top of dad's property there down over the hill there was some weeds that were growing and dad kept watching that helicopter and he said i wonder why they're flying over that spot and i said dad maybe it'd be a good idea we cut them down and burn them up i think i took i let him go to his grave not telling him it was don't hold it against me now dad i'm glad that old man is dead amen amen we're not a church of angels we're church of redeemed and so we just we we love each and every one of you and if you're coming and looking for perfect people well we're just redeemed people that's what we are that's what we are just and you just remember that this is a this is a con construction zone it's a hard hat area so you know there's a lot of work that's still to be done and and he's still working on us and so amen some of you are new some of you have been here for decades you just have patience with us but always remember jesus said that last one gets paid as much as the first one and so amen i sure appreciate you praying and praying for me this last week and we needed a real touch from the lord pneumonia and cancer is a bad burger and god has touched our body andrew's going to speak for us this morning and thank these guys for giving me a break for this weekend and so we'll speak to you next weekend the lord willing and and i thought last night was a masterpiece [Applause] amen i thought some of the key statements were god vindicated this and how can one how can man discredit that written soul amen man in his people mind trying to discredit god and so amen amen and so we i so enjoyed it i thought about brother homer how much he would have enjoyed that sermon he he looked he loved it when you just got right down to brass tacks and just laid it right out and and uh brother william just conducted it like a lawyer for a bit and if you notice he got anointed there so and if you ever get into that you'll uh you'll never always want to get back into it and so he showed us a little film this morning of our little buddy wesley just bouncing all over the house not running but bouncing bouncing bouncing he's running but he's bouncing amen so them legs are working real good now so we're we're just so thrilled for what god has done amen so thrilled and god's blessed just all and we have a sister here from indiana um is that right indiana and uh and we're so glad to have you with us and she's praying for direction in her life and and i want to pray for specifically for you in a moment and uh but we've we we have a prayer for brother reuben and sister abigail they're here and and she's carrying a baby and she is due in january january so we want to pray for that amen god bless them for those that don't know reuben's great grandfather introduced the message to brother homer amen and so introducing the message to brother homer and now we we started in a basement started in an old construction building then then a house made into a church and now this church and where will we be in a couple of years if the rapture don't happen so amen this is a good problem to have so amen if you can't find your seat it's a good problem to have and so i'm looking for that last one to come in amen and so then brother freddie has a serious very serious next surgery to go on and we want to pray for them this morning if that would be okay i know it's kind of out of order out of the ordinary but i'm not speaking today and i want andrew to have his complete freedom toward the end of this service amen and uh our sister from indiana what's your name esther all right esther we we would like for you to come and you drove from indiana and uh i i just have asked a couple of young people if if you were interested in dinner after church if you you could just if you could just i actually asked stephen stephen stand to your feet amen amen some other young people that are here that can go to dinner with them amen i'm not setting you up now i read your mind right off the bat but if it works out that way hallelujah amen so you can meet him on the porch after service you know it's it's different here it's just different here i don't go to a whole lot of rules but we just we just do things our way amen we're in the south here so and we're going to rise again so amen i want her to come and maybe if the brothers are coming we want to pray for direction in her life and that's what she's

grab your brother by the hand your sister by the hand let's just bind our hearts together in christian love this morning father we we approach you lord jesus lord reverently and respectful lord as humbly as we know how with the child like faith lord knowing that that all things are possible to them that believe and father we bow before the god of heaven just now knowing that you're here interceding on our behalf father lord and making making these things possible father according to our faith lord jesus and we bow lord knowing that you're here father we want to worship you lord jesus not just because you were the god of moses not just because you were the god of david but because you're our god lord today we recognize the nearness of the holy spirit father and that that your comforter is here to guide us through all things through all this word today and we pray father that you would have your liberty in this place today that that you would bind every demonic spirit and every every affliction and every disease lord that the enemy would try to hinder the move of god or hinder your children we pray father that you would come and have complete control of this service we give you preeminence in our faith we give you preeminence in our mind and our soul father we ask father the god of heaven as we invoke you just now that you would declare yourself here father lord we know what we've done with you but father may you come behind your word with an amen today lord according to your promises lord let them be yes and amen for every person that had an uplifted hand and an uplifted hearts need just now i pray that you'd make yourself known by your promises to your children today we'll be careful to serve you and to give you all the praise the glory and the honor that is due unto your name we pray this in the name of the lord jesus christ and the bride said amen if you have your bibles this morning we'd like to look over in a few passages here few passages this morning to gather our thought i'd like to look over in the book of luke chapter 4 and verse 18 then to joshua chapter 2 and then down to james chapter 1. amen luke chapter 4 and verse 18. i'd like to speak to you this this morning on a thought that the lord's placed on our heart on experiencing the liberty of the message experiencing the liberty of the message and jesus taking the book read and he said the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of the sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord joshua chapter 2 verse 1. and joshua the son of nun sent out of him two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and came into and harlot's house named rahab and lodged there james chapter 1 and verse 22. hallelujah do you love the lord this morning amen james chapter 1 and verse 22 but be you doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any man be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for beholdeth himself and go this way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein continueth therein and he being not forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord as we said we'd like to speak to you on experiencing the liberty of the message and from the from the passion translation i sent to the brothers that they might share it with you this morning here in james chapter 1 verse 23 it says that if you listen to the word and don't live out the message that you hear you become like the person who looks in the mirror of the word to discover the reflection of his face in the beginning you perceive how god sees you in the mirror of the word but then you go out and forget your divine origin but those who set their gaze deeply into the perfect law of liberty are fascinated by and respond to the truth that they hear and are strengthened by it and they experience god's blessings in all that they do when you begin to look at that word or you begin to look that whosoever looketh in the perfect law of liberty you begin to look that the one that is looking is looking not just haphazardly but he is looking with an intent and he's looking earnestly into the perfect law of liberty which is none other than jesus christ but this message that that that we have that i thought brother william just did a phenomenal job setting a case for christ last night but this message that you and i so so love and we are so acquainted with this message is not that of a message of rules of of do's and don'ts and you can't go here and you can't do this you can't wear that or you can't wear this but it is that of liberty that is given unto the children of the most high god you'll find that if you're the more that you go deeper into this message you'll find that it is a message that is a love letter to his children that understand through the through the written word that they understand that this is guarding them from the from the snares of the fowler and actually what this message does it liberates you from where you was and it takes you to a place that god is destined for your divine origin that nobody else can go there except for those that have been liberated by this message and i'm so thankful that i can identify with those that have experienced the liberty of this message and i hear some people say well i can't do this because of the message or i can't go out and i can't do this with my friends like i used to well i can't do that either because you see there was something on the inside of me that got changed and i i got liberated from the man that i once was to the man that he wanted me to be you see i have no more desire to go out and do those things no more because there was something on the inside of me that got birthed by a new kingdom that only he could put there before the foundation of the world and i'm so thankful to be standing right here with not people that are barred up with sin or borrowed up with all kinds of circumstances of religion but a people that understand freedom and people that understand the freedom of worship hey people that understand the power of the message and what it does for them the message didn't come for us just to have another school or just to have another thought but the message came to bring a people to loose the seven seals and set her free from every dogma and creed and every idea of man where men had tried to keep her so many years bound down by cold formal religions but the message of the hour came to set and elect people free so that they could come to a place that only god destined that they would live at this message is not bondage this message is our freedom hallelujah webster says that the word liberty it means the freedom from restraint in a general sense and applicable to the body soul and mind it is a state of exemption from the control of others so a man that enjoys liberty when he enjoys liberty when there's no physical force to operate or to restrain his actions and i think that that's exactly what the message has done for us it has taken every physical force that the enemy has come in and tried to rob from you and i it has moved those things out of our way so that we can act exactly like the king wants us to act i believe that esther walked in there and she may have had fear because of me she may have walked into the king's court and she may have been fearful knowing that if the king doesn't drop down his scepter but if she would have really walked in there with the idea that i am the queen and i have every right to walk in here you know that she was completely liberated to walk in there because she was half of the kingdom do you realize today that you can walk into the shekinah glory because you own half of the kingdom this morning i want you to recognize that you are the most powerful people that has ever been upon the face of the earth george washington was a powerful man abraham lincoln was a powerful man but those men cannot even hold a shadow to what the bride of jesus christ is i say wesley was a good man luther was a good man but they can't stand in front of the church of the living god that's been liberated by the message of the hour [Applause] it's the light that done the work notice what brother man was saying the manifestation of the spirit in 1951 he said now the meeting will be what you determine in your own heart it can be a time that all of these people sitting here in these chairs can be at liberty walking around here on the street it can be those that's on cots delivered to those suffering with cancer and heart troubles we'll be back in here and it can be to every one of you a deliverance he said now if god will help me to let it be known to you just how simple it is then you receive it if you can recognize how simple it is then you can receive it and if you recognize that that no matter what may be called you can go through deuteronomy 28 and you can look at all the curses you can look at all the curses that would come upon the children of god if they turn back to serve the gods of egypt and you can look over there and you can line up all of those diseases but i want you to know there's one inoculation for every single one of those diseases and you can set here completely free from every cancer demon from every covet demon from every cold demon from every tuberculosis demon is that right i want you to know that there is power right here this morning and it's not just something that you're reaching out into the atmosphere that you can't grab a hold of but i want to know let you know that there is a living god that is here that is energizing this atmosphere that is energizing this people that will not allow you to be manhandled or devil handled but god wants you to be god handled god don't want you dealing with sickness god don't want you dealing with cancer god wants you to be god-handled i'll say this david was a giant killer but my god's a giant killer today my god's a cancer-killing god my god's a a sin killing god [Applause] i said let god have his liberty in this place let god have his liberty it's amazing thing when somebody begins to feel liberated you know there's just certain people around that you get around that sometimes you can get comfortable with and there's other people that you don't feel comfortable around and you kind of you kind of pull back a little bit because because they you're not in your comfort zone and and you just never know where the conversation is going so you try to guard yourself a little bit that's a smart thing to do but if you're really around somebody that you know that somebody that you can trust as the old saying goes you can let your hair down as it was ain't that right brother and you can let your hair down and you can just you can let yourself free and you can really enjoy that person because you know you know your conversation ain't gonna go somewhere outside but if you realize that that if you get around the atmosphere of the holy ghost that if you ever get one time good and comfortable in the presence of the living god you can really let your hair down you can shake out your bobby pins or you can shake out all your all your curls that you put up all morning you can really get comfortable in his presence and you can start having a conversation with the king of kings because you're comfortable with him it's amazing thing when you can feel freedom it's amazing now i'm i'm going i'm going back way back here just for a moment just to just to grab something something that i personally do not remember but if you if you're under the law if you're under the law you see you cannot have full liberty is that right if you're under the law but if you're under grace you can have full access to the liberty of jesus christ but they told me now this is this is they say and i have a whole lot of trouble with they say but you remember you'll you'll find out what i'm having problem with here but back when i was a child when we was living up in pilot virginia uh virginia there there we had a little house up there and our cousin that tj he'd come down every once in a while we we'd play and we man we killed more cowboys and more indians than anybody could ever imagine we had six shooters and everything else but they said i don't remember this thank god maybe he wiped it away from my memory you know i don't know but this is what they said but they said they said that me tj and matthew were out there playing and we was playing along and we went upstairs and we took those play handcuffs you know those things that kids got when these cowboys took him handcuffs and i don't know why in the world this is what they said i didn't do i didn't say it but they said that we took those handcuffs and we put them on matthew and we handcuffed him to the toy box or something up there and we went out and played exactly how we wanted to play obviously i don't remember it but obviously there was something that was the law there that was keeping us from really being liberated the way that we really wanted to play and buddy we thought we had liberation until the law until the law got home and i found out who had real liberty they had liberty to take their liberty to the backside now i don't remember that but that's what they say now i've got you over here on my side now they used to say that i used to drink they used to say that i run dope and they used to say all these other things but you see when the law came when jesus christ came he didn't do away with the law he magnified the law and he showed that he was the one that could fulfill every portion of it and the devil said that i did this and the devil said that i did this and he tried to arrest me so that i couldn't go on so i couldn't really have the liberty of the spirit of the living god but then jesus came by my way and said let them go free now we put the handcuffs on the devil it's time that you take this living word and push the devil back into a corner don't you let him push you around don't you let him tell you what you ought to do don't you let him tell you how you ought to worship it's time that you accept your liberty as the sons of the living god there ain't no experience like the liberty of this message but i'll tell you what i am sick and tired of hearing is people trying to arrest the spirit of the living god trying to cuff god in a corner and say we'll serve god the way we want to we won't have none of that worship we will have none of that screaming we won't have none of that acts 2 38 blabbering speaking in tongues she said that's the kind she said she don't want nothing to do with it if you're identifying that you don't want this in your church you are proving that you are a modern church and you're dead from the roots up stop arresting the power of the holy ghost and let the holy ghost have his liberty in the church of the living god if you're sitting in a church in that church i'm not trying to get you to move here but if your church is not say it's not accepting the liberty of jesus christ move move to a place that you can really worship god there's too many people crowding the message of the hour saying we got to do this and we got to do that let the message be the message the message will set you free the message will liberate you [Applause] you're just preaching that because your friends are preaching that you're just preaching that because your granddaddy preached that let me tell you this this was birthed on the inside of me before there was a foundation of the world i ain't preaching this because homer fraser preached i ain't preaching this because ron spencer preaching or tim pruitt's preaching i'm preaching this because this is exactly what paul preached where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty and now what he said in second corinthians 3 17 that where the spirit of the lord is the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty there is freedom hallelujah let god have his liberty let me move on just for a moment no let me let me draw right right quick right here a few months ago there was a there was a meeting that went on there was a meeting that went on down in christiansburg virginia and we brother ron i went through the prayer line and you were many of you were there that night but i want to use this one individual just because of the experience that happened my cousin malachi had had been searching for us and we'd been taken away out of the prayer line i matter of fact i don't know how how i got to the van much less how dad got to his vehicle brother malachi was looking for us because he had a desire of his heart because he knew that there was a word that he needed right there and he was looking with everything that was within him and he was hunting for it he was trying to get to me and and then my wife my wife was able to make it make way for him to get there by the time that he got there things was just getting right on the inside of that van we had a van full of people in there and i'm telling you the holy ghost busted out in there and i i've never quite experienced anything like that but there there the angel the lord began to do do a work and brother malachi you can go and ask him he'll tell it to you he said but he never had a breakthrough like that in and that's his words he experienced his breakthrough and if you if you listen to somebody that really has had a breakthrough their language changes everything about them has changed we rode we rode up that road for 45 minutes to an hour i didn't know where i was but they were speaking in tongues and shouting going on for over an hour on the inside of that van going on we people were called by people were caught by accident and they heard what was going on and they just joined on in with us but what i what i'm trying to say is there's sometimes there's sometimes that you've got to get to a spot where you can get you can have a breakthrough and when you have a breakthrough you don't care who's around you you don't care what setting that you're in it doesn't even matter if it's in a van i want you to know the holy ghost who come to you in a car he'll come to you and anywhere that you are just to make sure that you get your breakthrough this message has the power to get you out of the trap of the enemy it has the power to set you free and it has the power to use you exactly where god wants you to be used at now brother burnham said in in the god who is rich in mercy he said that when any believer comes to god he becomes god's attributes of his word he said he is used to manifest the word that's promised for that day when any believer comes to god he becomes god's attributes of his word and he is used to manifest the word of that day just like abraham was used in the drama when you watch the drama how it set out that god was using the character of abraham but god doesn't just use anybody he uses somebody that was in his mind and he's using caliber of men and caliber of women that know how to handle the word and he knows what they're going to do with the word that's why he gives it unto them is that right but abraham knew what he wanted done with the word and abraham when he was out there and the in the and those kings came up there and got lot his nephew they come up there abraham the bible said that abraham armed himself and his 318 men servants and he went out there and he recovered all of the goods all of the goods that those kings had came in had came in and taken away from him and the kings and the king of sodom went down there and told abraham i want you to take of the goods now notice abraham was used to manifest the word of that day what was he doing he was expressing or manifesting christ as a savior and that king of sodom said now you take of these goods you went over there and you recovered a lot you recovered all the goods that these kings came in and stole now you come in and you take some of these goods but notice abraham's language he said i am not going to take of anything he said i'm not even going to take a shoestring from you he said because if i do you'll say that abraham is rich because of my hand and abraham was saying my liberty didn't come from you and my liberty ain't getting taken away from you is that right you see what god has given unto you is for you it ain't for somebody else it's for you you see what we have come become brother branham said and things that ought to be he said we have came from time beings to mortal beings to eternal beings he said when our when our soul was lit when our soul was lit by the very word of god we became sons of god it's amazing to me it's always astounding to me when god when god comes to us and he comes to us when we're in our trial and we're in our in our troubles but god does not come to us and talk to us about the problems that we're in he does not talk to us about our crisis he does not talk to us about this things that are going on he does not talk to us about our sickness he doesn't talk to us about our welfare but he comes to us just like he came to job and he took job up and showed him a vision and he showed him the very foundations of the world and said job where was you now i want you to look all over this vision job look at the panoramic here's the foundation of the world but job where was you at where was you at job was in the midst of the greatest trial of anybody that could ever go through in one year everything had been stolen from him his children been stolen from him his camels and his oxen and his and his asses have been taken from him but notice the one thing that the enemy couldn't take and it was his wife hallelujah there may be a lot of things that get shook off in this kingdom in this kingdom of laodicea but you have received a kingdom that cannot be shook and the wife of heaven everything around you might fall away everything around you may fade away but the king's wife will still remain he'd come to him talk about his problems he come to talk to him where he came from i noticed that every single time god come to me or comes to somebody that's in trouble he'd never talk to them about their problems he didn't come to abraham and talk to him about his problems what did he use he used him to manifest the word of his day what did abraham do he recognized that it was the anointing that led him to that victory is that right can you identify that it is the the anointing of almighty god that leads you to every victory small victories great victories it is the anointing of the lord that brings you to perfect liberty in the law of jesus christ now notice what the bible said in isaiah 58 and 6 is not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bands of the wickedness to undo heaviness heavy burdens and let oppressed let the oppressed go free and they break every yoke isn't this not the fast is this not what i am to do that the power of my word will break the yoke will break the burden will break the bands of oppression and any day that we've ever fought oppression and depression it's this day but you let your minds just recall for a moment when brother brandon was brought a woman that they had to stop the meeting for that this this woman's husband had there was no ambulance that would bring her to the meetings so this husband hired out men to take a station wagon and to carry this woman to brother branham's meeting because he knew that the doctors could not help her in the condition that she was in so they brought this lady to they locked his they brought this lady to the meeting and they put her down there in that basement and they brought brother branham down there and he drawed his attention to the woman and when he when he brought her down there the husband began to talk to the brother branham and speaking to speak to him and converse about what was going on you remember the story and they began to converse what was going on says she's been out of her mind these two years doctors can't help her i won't go through every single detail but brother man i'm saying i'm going to go over there and i'm going to shake her hand and when brother man hit the man had said no no don't do that don't do that he said gee she don't know who you are she's there's something on her and brother adam said she was slithering around like a snake so she's slithering around like a snake and it's amazing when you go to watch a demon that that is about to get cast out that he begins to go down to the ground where he first was bound to and there she began to slither on that ground brother branham went over there and he began to shake her hand and that demon grabbed a hold of brother branham's hand through that woman and jerked him up off of his feet he said if i wouldn't handle sturdy hands he said she would have pulled me down on the ground he said but there that that demon began to scream out of that woman and said william branham you have nothing to do with me and the husband said now now wait a minute she don't even know her own name now how does she know your name and brother brandon said now it's not that woman it's that demon on the inside of her and he said well what's causing this he said that demon recognizes that something is getting ready to happen and brother branham said that he just prayed a very simple prayer over that woman and they took her back there and she was in a right mind within a few hours now when you begin to think about when satan gets bound back to where he was and he's in a spot and he begins to act just exactly like he was watch what jesus christ does he shows that he was the seed that was come to bruise the serpent's head i've never seen one demon that was too powerful for my lord jesus christ i'm not making a challenge to the devil but i am challenging the name of jesus christ that every devil has to bow to the name of jesus christ you watch what happened when that simple little childlike faith was prayed over that woman with that much power that much demon power on the inside of her the name of jesus christ liberated that woman to the woman that she was born to be like now you don't realize that you run into devils all day head-long day every single one of you you run into them but you don't recognize it but i want you to know there is liberty to that enemy that may be attacking you might attack you with cancer might attack you of this might attack you of that but there is liberty when the word of god begins to have access you remember what isaiah would say in isaiah 10 and 27 that his yoke from off of thy neck and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing you watch what happens it's the anointing that breaks the yoke of the enemy and if you can realize what day that we're living in that we're going through birth pains like never before and it's a time to be steady because god is fixing to move and if you'll realize where you're standing at it's this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears but you begin to watch as people go on through their christian journey or through their life through their walk or through their life you watch them and brother brandon just go do a study one time on living under your god-given privileges it's a powerful study and brother bannon would lay that lay that in there that we're living under our god-given privileges and i personally believe there's not ev there's not one person in here that has to live that way are we on the same are we on the same accord this morning that none of us have to live below our god-given privileges but we can come up to the level of our god-given privileges and access what god has given unto us but notice when people do live beyond their god-given privileges notice what psalms 137 says that by the rivers of babylon there was set down yea we wept and when we remembered zion when they remembered their liberty we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof for there they carried us away captive required of us a song and they wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us of the songs of zion but how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land now let me ask you something there's no way that anybody can say things sing thank god i'm free as long as you're bound there's nobody that can sing there's power in the blood as long as you're still enslaved but if you can ever get free one time you can start singing thank god i'm free there's power in the blood of jesus christ well you notice these people had hanged their harps the thing that was built for worship the thing that was built for praise they hung it up on the willow trees i'm gonna deal with something real delicate right here but there's too many times people have been pushed aside to set their gifts over on a willow tree because they're trying to serve god out in some strange land i know what i'm talking about right here and i want to be real delicate but i want to i want to drive a point there's a person that's here that is that that is that is understanding exactly what i'm saying just now that was asked to hang their harp upon a on a willow tree i said we we're not going to have that here no more they were they were pushed in a corner that they wouldn't be able to have their praise the way that they wanted to but when they got into the land that they were destined to be here they were able to bring that heart off of that willow tree and really echo out the praises of the most high god you see because so many times it's not our own doing that does it but men try to push your gift over in a corner so that your gift doesn't shine and you watch when god designs a gift and he sets it up men can try to push it in a corner but god will make a way for it to shine out in its glory because he is the one that gifts and callings are without repentance if you've got a gift don't you let no man put you in a corner where you say well i don't necessarily have a gift can you say amen don't you ever let nobody put your gift over in a corner i say let liberty come in the church of the living god like never before it's not a time to hang up your hearts it's the time to get them down it's a time that you bring your menstrual out elijah and you start singing songs under the most high god [Applause] i'm gonna sing a song to you after a while and this means war and i'm gonna sing it to the devil you can't have my breakthrough you can't have my increase well i'm going to sing it just a little bit different a little bit later you can't have my message you can't have my dance you can't have my praise you can't have my preaching you can have my gift you can't have my heart you can't have my praise you can't have my dance you can't have my family you can't have my pastor you can't have this you can't have this you can't have this this means war if there ever was a time to seek a sword and a devil it's right now we're on the venice line it's time to run with everything that's within you [Applause] there ain't one chain on you brother randall there ain't one circumstance on you brother timmy it's time that you come into the land and sing [Applause] sing o'barren it's time to bring forth oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but notice notice what brother branham says in broken sister it's a powerful message fits so perfectly with last night's message that was brought forth he said notice how the believer is liberated notice how he's liberated his ones who receive this water not a local rain not a revival from here and there and get the miss mill cramps and got wiggle tails in it but notice how he liberated his ones who received this water he said by grace not by a system or a cistern or an education he said he vindicates his word he said that's how he liberates the ones that received this water and you think about what you've been drinking on it's that artisan whale it's not where you're sad or you're satisfied with just one rain here or one rain on the weekend or one rain over here at a special meeting but it's a people that are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man and those that seek after the kingdom of god those that are hungry and thirst shall be filled and you watch how christ begins to liberate his people he comes down i happen to say i happen to say this is one of the greatest times of my whole entire life i've been preaching for 12 years but i've never preached i've never preached a message people on this level before it's the same people but we're in a very special season that god is liberating his people with a rain that has came down from above i happen to believe this is that harvest rain it's that harvest rain that's getting that wheat exactly ready they're ready and you'll watch as the angels begin to bind up the tares and you watch as that weed begins to rejoice in the rain that came down the rain wasn't meant for the weed though there wasn't meant for the tares the tares rejoiced in it the tares praised the tares getting much excited about it just like you do but when the angels start binding up the tears and the rain comes down on the real wheat you watch that week shine like never before it's her rain it's her king hallelujah let me tell you that wheat when it gets under that rain and it gets stimulated it doesn't care what anybody else thinks it waves in the wind it blesses his name it brings a wave sheath before him do you see what happened down there just see what happened in louisiana just see what happened in tennessee did you see what happened in canada it's the rain it's a liberating rain this message didn't come to put you in some shackles it didn't come to bind you up this message came to liberate you and the bible said whom the son has set free is free indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free for the lord the spirit of christ jesus christ have made me free from the law of sin and death you're free you're free now watch watch what jesus would do and notice how he takes it takes a woman of your fame and he comes to her at her life source he comes to her at her well i find it amazing that jesus will come to you where you are but it's amazing to watch what jesus does with you after you get done with your old well and you find a new one but notice what he did mother madam would take this woman prayer line after prayer line set up every single prayer line with this woman now what am i what was he doing he was he said now brother branham would say now now jesus when he was standing there he said he was catching her spirit he began to talk to her and he began to catch her spirit begin to talk to her where she was living at and know all those things branham said that jesus liberated her by the secrets of the heart he began to deal with her and you can go throughout you can go throughout about every message and you can find where the angel would come behind the message all the time and vindicate that this was the truth but you'll find almost in every single service that brother branham as he's setting up a prayer line he brings up this woman remember that woman at the well now now now sister you're standing here before me you're nervous you've got this you've got this condition that's going on and he said this is exactly how the master did it this is exactly how the master did it he caught her spirit they began to speak to her and he began to tell her the very secrets of her heart and he said she got her liberty by the secrets being known unto her and you watch what the spirit of the living god does when he takes that word of hebrews 4 and 12 that the word of god is quick and the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and it's amazing to watch that god would take a pastor or a preacher or an evangelist and he'll take him down an avenue because what is he trying to do he is trying to get the people of god to get into a spot where he can liberate them maybe in their mind maybe in their hearts maybe in their soul he's trying to liberate them so that man of god will go down through a channel and it looks like man this guy's so far off the map he's now he's nowhere near where i'm living at and you watch all of a sudden god will take a direct turn and he'll come down your tin can alley and what is he doing he is liberating you from the things that were holding you bound you remember when brother branham had that dream you remember when brother branham had that dream of that he fell asleep and there was that there was that man that was that was beating that woman brother branham thought at first that it was his mama that this man was beating his mama with that three corner club he was beating her and he said every single time that the woman would try to rise up and and accept the truth he said he began to beat her again he said but i began to recognize he said i began to recognize that that was the enemy and every time that she would begin to accept the the name of jesus christ baptism he said she was beating her with that trinitarian doctrine and he said every time i watched him he said he beat her he said but he said all of a sudden he said i was scared he said i was scared of him he said all of a sudden he said i reached up there and i grabbed him by the caller he said now you leave her alone or you're going to have to deal with me and brother baron said about that time he said his faith muscles begin to grow and he said he began to recognize he and he began to liberate her by the preaching of the name of jesus christ and you watch how the enemy comes in through every creed or every dogma he comes in and tries to beat the people down with a two-person god or a three priest a person god and he's trying to beat them down and put them in a corner so that they cannot accept the real liberty of the name of jesus christ but there was a prophet messenger that stood right here in this day in this laodicean church age and declared to you and i the power of the name of jesus christ and you watch every single time that satan comes against you and every time you begin to accept the truth and you begin to experience a little bit of liberty in the message of the hour satan will come and beat you down with a three-corner club you watch how he uses that thing and he'll beat you down but there is a power that you can experience in the power of this message don't you realize what satan is trying to do he's trying to push you over in a corner but i've already give you instructions what to do you push him in the corner don't you stand there and allow the the thwarted enemy and don't you allow him to push you back and say that you can't have this or you can't have this message or you can't have your breakthrough or you can't have your family it's a time that the church of the living god raise up not with a three-corner club but take the name of jesus christ take the rod of moses and beat down those pharaohs beat down those egyptians that are trying to keep you back there under the slave mentality it's time you be liberated miriam it's time that you get on the other side of your red sea grab your tambourine have yourself a praise break now watch he said but as long as satan can keep you afraid to claim your inheritance he said then he's got you and he said tonight maybe maybe a cancer has has conquered you maybe something else has taken a hold of you some disease or even the disease of sin or whatever it is it may look dark and gloomy to you now may look like you'll never recover maybe look like you can't get over that tb that prostate trouble or or that lung trouble whatever it is that tumor that crippled condition the doctor may may have every hope may say every hope is gone but standing right by your side tonight ready to take you into possession stands the eyes of faith who sees the victory under through the lord jesus christ hallelujah he said away with satan and his gloom now let me let me just let me demonstrate this for you standing right beside you is the one that sees your victory is that is that too hard to do just reach out and kind of brush the air just a little bit they're standing right beside you stands the one that is seeing the victory now now if if we could just get his mindset just for a minute like paul would say in philippians let this mind be in you now jesus ain't looking at what you've got going on over here jesus is looking at your secured victory let me come down a little bit further god jesus is looking at you being filled with the holy ghost jesus is looking at these young girls being completely delivered from the lay odyssey and flu jesus is looking at a people that are liberated but it's satan's tactic to keep you over here bound and looking through the eyes of humanity but if you can just shift your view just for a moment and look earnestly into the perfect law of liberty and continue therein don't get sidetracked and worried about what's going on stay right in line stay right in line and get in focus with the word of god stay right there and march into that step of onward christian soul church stay right there stay in line get in line brother your victory is on its path do you realize that salvation is your emancipation from everything that you have every right to go free and when you accept salvation as your emancipation you can act accordingly you can act accordingly you can speak like a winner you can have the language of a conqueror you can confess your freedom instead of your bondage you can confess with his traps i'm healed instead of your sickness you can confess your redemption from all your diseases you can confess redemption that that your redemption is complete from sin and sickness confess that satan's dominion over you into the calvary because it was there that god freed you salvation is your emancipation from everything because god's word states all of this so confess it why don't you just have yourself a little witness party right there to yourself go ahead have yourself a witness convention right there have a witness convention to your neighbor tell them how you're liberated confess to them how he's your savior confess to them how he's your healer confess to them how you've been delivered go ahead give him 30 seconds of a confession right now what are you doing brother andrew you ever be you ever built a fire you got to have some elements you got to have fuel you got to have oxygen and you got to you got to have so you got to have some material i've already give you some material now i'm just breathing on you some holy ghost oxygen right here i'm breathing across the fire of the holy ghost what i'm wanting you to do is give witness to what this emancipation has done for you if those slaves if those slaves could come that hill and wait for the sun to shine they were slaves as long as they were living under slavery they were slaves living in a house they were still slaves they still had bondage on them but when they heard the emancipation proclamation they were no longer slaves you can't hold us in slave quarters no more i have been set free you can't beat me no more you can't tell me what to do no more this message didn't come to tell you what to do you can act accordingly because the message is the dress wear [Applause] oh go ahead and fan that thing one time i'm no longer a slave to fear i'm no longer a slave to circumcised i'm no longer a slave to disease i'm no longer a slave to sin i'm no longer a slave to torment i'm no longer a slave to anxiety hallelujah hallelujah i'll say the same one that breathe in the adam's nostrils is the same one that's breathing across the this congregation right now if he stood there in the book of john and he breathed in the holy ghost and he went up there in the upper room and they received their promise how about your upper room experience right now why don't you experience the same liberty that mary the mother of jesus christ's experience why don't you go on in the upper room where peter was a coward one path and on the other side he busted out preaching this message why don't you climb up them ladders go into that candle room get up in there with 120 others and say i'm gonna have my breakthrough i'm gonna have my praise break i'm gonna have my holy ghost i'm gonna have my deliverance i'm gonna have what god has for me because i made up my mind i'm going all the way with jesus every devil can rise against me every circumstance and go against me but i'm going on with jesus just the same blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] hallelujah you keep fanning it satan don't know what he's doing he don't know what he's messing with because we're not just justified we're not just sanctified we have been glorified what shall we say to these things of god before us so what power are you representing here today if jesus could stand there i i'm keep i'm gonna keep adding some fuel to this thing cause i got a feeling it's gonna blow here a little bit you better watch out brother ron's identified with explosions he's already been through one and knows how to come out on the other side we got somebody on our camp in our camp that knows how to go through the fire so i'm gonna keep building this guy this case up and we'll just let it blow here after a little bit if it's all right but if jesus could go there and when he was speaking to his disciples and his disciples came back and there was a father that came up there and his son was a lunatic and he and every time that that the enemy would come upon him he'd fall into the fire and he said look he said i brought my son unto your children under your disciples and he said they couldn't remove it off of it but jesus turned to them and they asked him said why couldn't we move this thing off of him he said because of your unbelief he said but if you can have the faith of a grain of a mustard seed you shall speak to this mountain and then we move from here to yonder notice what he said and nothing shall be impossible to you he didn't say to me he said to you and i speak the name of jesus to the church of the living god right here there is nothing that is impossible to a church that decides to believe if you believe for healing you better get ready you better watch out sickness will leave this place faster than you can imagine if you'll start believing in the power of healing let me tell you when jesus was standing up there and he was talking to his disciples in luke chapter 10 and he told him said now rejoice not because the enemies that your enemies are subject to you he said but rejoice that your names are written down in the lamb's book of life and then jesus said and behold i saw satan fallen like lightning what was it brother branham said it was when the church was receiving her power and when she was moving forward into the promises of god satan failed from the heavenly atmosphere and when you start believing for the impossible satan comes down as the prince of the power of the air i say yes yes now are we the sons of god it ain't some day coming it ain't someday in the future it's right now and i happen to believe that it's been provided there's a sacrifice that's been provided for your sin that's provided for your for for your healing it's provided for your freedom it's provided for your joy it's provided for your fee your peace i believe that every single one of you sitting here is an attribute of jesus christ and god is wanting to use you to manifest the very word of the shower i'm gonna keep driving i'm gonna keep driving right here every time i see a snake i don't just run over once i get it two or three times i think i don't hit this thing one or two times let's go ahead and get him one more time jesus christ is a perfect sacrifice that was provided for brother fred's surgery he was provided for your needs he was provided for your production and brother branham would say now if there's some serpent he said if there's a serpent that's got a foot and he's reaching out and grabbing me and it's attacking me he said i don't have to go down there and hit its foot he said all i have to do is reach over and hit it in the head and kill every organ in its body that way it can't attack me no more i'm gonna put you in reverse one more time i'm gonna run over top of you there is no weapon that is formed against me that shall prosper had felt good year of god little children and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world now you're getting the point it's not by might it's not by power but by my spirit saith the lord [Applause] let's get him one more time he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed you got him right in the corner brother burnham one time him and billy were riding down the road that's good i like an old soldier fighting with me billy were driving down the road one time and he said there was these these folks that had it was riding down the road and had a had an accident they sideswiped us sideswiped his car and they the car had rolled over and it was a bunch of them that was there but the car had rolled over it had rolled over on this one and these these men were trying to get this car over the car had pinned this one boy underneath of it and they were trying to roll it off of him and the boy underneath her there started started screaming and i said don't you're going to kill me you're messing with me you're killing me don't don't don't do that i said we got to get it off of you said this car's catching a fire i don't know why i'm telling this so but this car is catching a fire so we got to get it off of you brother branham brother branham snook up snuck up right up there and said son are you a christian are you a christian he said no sir brother said you better pray he said yes sir and he started to pray and brother brown said i he said i'll never know until the judgment day what happened he said but the sixth sense went to work that's what he said you can go study it out see if i'm right or not he said but the sixth sense went to work he said i'll never know what happened he said but i walked on the back side of that car he said all of a sudden that car flipped off of him and he said that boy jumped up and he was perfectly well what was it it was faith the sixth sense that went to work it was it was that work of faith that began to liberate that one that that was pinned and brother brother burns said it satan may pin you in a corner of cancer he may paint it out he may pin you under a car someday but christ is here i say this to the church of the living god don't you dare let shake and pin you underneath a car or pin you in a corner stand there in your liberty and say satan i condemn the very works of the kingdom of hell take your hands off of god's property oh hallelujah let me get to my text oh that was free he cares for you he cares for you no matter where you are you might be an outsider on the outside of the wall but he cares for you he will come to you because he cares for you and rahab was an outsider he was an outcast but she had seen the power of the supernatural god because when you put on when you've been put on the outside of the city and nobody else wants you because of the lifestyle that you live in you start to see the outside what really what's really what's living like the same man putting you how satan may have put you out on the outside of the wall and give you a lifestyle gave you a lifestyle that it looked like well if she dies somebody else will take her place somebody else can fill in for her but she was coming to the end of her road she was about past her spot of prime and she was losing customers but she was on the outside and she was looking over there and she began to see a supernatural sign and they began to hear the murmurings and begin to hear about the supernatural god but she heard about a god that would lead a people when he was coming down in a pillar of fire and he was leading them i should begin to look and think if that god could do that for them people that were under that much slave mentality how much more does he care about me and my condition she begin to recognize and when you begin to recognize the presence of the living god it releases a power to you it'll set you free and this little rahab when she looked out there and there was two men that came by with a message and they came in there and she housed them in their notice when they came in there she lied to them and told them i don't know where they were but she was hiding that message in a secret spot she was hiding that message because she knew that it was her escape out of this chaos of life she was outcast but she was cared for by the king of kings and these two men made an oath with this woman they made an oath with this woman by the same by the same token that you let us down out of this window the same window that she was looking out and seeing the power of a supernatural god was the same window that she let those men down out of now she said now listen they said now listen look if you take up this token the blood of your family be upon you and not upon ourselves but i'm telling you as long as this token is there mamas and daddies let me tell you young girls let me tell you as long as this token is there the blood there you you cannot be guilty for yourself because there's somebody that's already paid for you mamas mamas right now is the time to play the token like never before right now is the time to go and listen to that message like never before he preaches it in 1963 on my birthday september the 1st he preaches to you the token but he said these men made an oath with her that when the destroying angel comes by there by the name of joshua he will remember what we have said unto you let me say something to you i just was here and he remembers what we've said to you you're not going to leave here the same way you walked in here you may have walked in here one way but you're leaving here another can i give you a word of a prophet they told her said you go in there and you get your father and you get your mother you get your family and you get them on the inside of here and brother brandon said you take your token and you claim your children you may not be wanted by everybody else when i say this you're wanted by a captain because he cares for you what was it the token was her liberty the token was her way out and there is no other way outside of laodicea except for this token it ain't a tape it ain't a picture it's a life and the blood of jesus christ the life of jesus christ was set for you and i and you can walk out of your prison bars rahab everything is going to lack down around you everything is going to fall all around you but rahab ray have you had faith enough to believe in me and by your works your faith has been expressed hallelujah rahab i want you to get ready you're gathering everybody in here the token is your liberty everybody that you got in is going to go out free you remember when paul when silas was up there in acts 16 and 25 that the bible said at midnight paul and silas begin to pray and sing praises under god it was at the midnight hour when all hell was at its highest height you watch what brother branham says he said when the angel begins to deal with him it's about two or three o'clock in the morning he said it's when those devils are going to sleep here's but here at the midnight hour at the midnight hour paul and silas begin to sing praises unto god and they begin to sing in such a way that all of the prisoners heard them i tell you right now if you've been free by the power of jesus christ you ought to sing to every prisoner of sin ought to be able to hear you you ought to be able to praise to every prisoner of chains of sickness of complexes of anxiety every prisoner ought to be able to hear you and when they begin to sing maybe they got to sing in that song this means war i got joy in my soul god is in control i got satan on my trail but i'm singing all as well maybe they got up there and they were singing that song maybe they got singing sister mary ellen song every prayer he says to our god every word of worship is do i god maybe they got to sing in jeremiah song it's just like fire that shut up in my bones it's that holy ghost fire and shut up in my bones [Applause] [Music] and their praise they're praising when you think well is there really power in your praise rahab you might be on the inside but there's a shout on the outside that's going to get you out and paul and silas you may be on the inside and there might be prisoners on the inside of there with you but there's going to be a praise that'll get you out of here so it doesn't matter where your praise at your praise will get you out [Applause] and suddenly there was an earthquake and all of the prison doors flung wide there was something powerful when paul began to sing when paul began to praise there became an earthquake that the prison doors flung wide remember what the prison guard said said oh my goodness i'm going to commit suicide right here but paul said don't harm yourself don't you harm yourself we're still in here singing lay odyssey we have been set free from you every chain's been struck off of us every complex has been struck over us you can't hold us no more you can't hinder us no more but leonistia we're still here don't you harm yourself we're still here and there's hope for you what shall i do to be saved and paul took him out and baptized him in his house the same hour [Applause] oh let the baptism of the holy ghost move in this place if the woman at the well could experience liberty if elisha could experience liberty when the sons of the prophets told him said don't don't you know don't you know that your predecessor is getting ready to be taken away from you he said yes i know but i don't want your dead code intellectual schools of theology i want the same message that william branham's got i want the same message that elijah's got i'm not going to stay back there with your cold your cold ideas i'm going on it might look like i'm going by myself but i'm crossing that river and when i get on the other side of the river god's going to give me a promise he's going to give me a double portion and i'm going to scream out where be the god of elijah i'm hearing that going out right now if elisha could experience liberty what about you as sons and daughters of god i say way to be the god of elijah i ain't talking about some robe i ain't talking about williams brandon's coat i'm talking about you taking this message and you slap in the river that's in front of you and say where be the god of elijah at i've lived this message i've experienced his power but where be the god of elijah i'd be like gideon if god be for us then where be all of us these miracles out why can't erica parker be healed why can't ron spencer be healed why can't ruth wilson be healed why can't our prodigals return why can't we have liberty like never before you give me one good reason and there ain't one reason that'll stand up before the word of jesus christ where be the god of miracles at if the god that brought ron spencer out of a fire will be the god that brings ron spencer out of a cancer trial [Applause] it's time to experience some liberty gabriel you take this one michael you take this what i'm going down to the fire and i'm bringing my children out [Applause] esther it's time to walk in it's time to walk into the courts amen can't hold you no more it's time to walk into the courts like never before it's time that you pull your harp down off the willow tree and you start praising like never before [Applause] i know where you're standing at and i know that you're free don't you let the devil ever whisper in your ear that you're still locked up in chains and that you're still dealing with this you have been set free and whom the son is set free he is free indeed if you're free don't walk back into the prison if you're free don't walk back in the bondage [Applause] it's good ain't it sister phyllis it's good ain't it they ain't nothing like the liberty of the holy ghost we're not just serving god anyway we're serving god the right way brother branham was bought her late brought a lady one time got a phone call got a phone call on the on the telephone it didn't know who the woman was but the lady the woman had her daughter had hodgkin's disease and they'd sent off they set off the condition or sent off one of the biopsies and sent it off and it came back and it was perfectly hodgkin's disease and they told her said don't tell nothing to your daughter just let her go on all the same and the woman called brother branham said now what are we going to do with this what do i do what do i do brother brown said well you bring her and you put her in the prayer line brother brown didn't know who this woman was and she come through there and brother brandon said that she when she come through there he said i had this funny feeling when i was on the phone with her he said when she come through there he said i don't know who she was he said but she come through there and had that blue paint all over her face and blue lips blue looking lips like they had down in high school on those things that's where a lot of these kids pick that stuff up at that's why you gotta apply a token like never before and brother branham said that she'd come there her and her mama come through that prayer line and said i looked up on them and both of them were without god and he said now how can you expect god to do anything for you if you're living like that now let me ask you something how do you expect god to do anything for you if you don't change the way that you're living but if you can have a step over on the other side and step over there and when those two women accepted the lord jesus christ brother branham said i prayed a prayer for her and the hodgkin's disease was completely gone right there let me say this in the name of jesus christ there is power to break sin power to break makeup power to break everything that you've got on you and it also has the power to break hodgkin's disease if god can do it for elena butts if god can do it for mariah pruitt if god can do it for this one or that one then why can't he do it for you i got one more scripture and i'm closing don't leave because i'm closing leave when you're filled up turn with me to isaiah 42 musicians come because it's time to sing this means war the bible said in isaiah 42 and 5 thus saith god the lord he created the heavens and he stretched them out and he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he giveth breath unto the people upon it and the spirit to them that walk therein i the lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold that hand that's the kind of god i want holding my hand and i will hold the hand and i will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that set in darkness out of the prison house i am the lord that is my name and my glory will i not give to another neither my praise to graven images behold the former things are come to pass and new things do i do declare before they spring forth i tell you of them before it ever happens god is already telling you you got victory before you ever see the baby moving god's already gave you the victory before you see your breakthrough god's already told you about it before they spring forth i tell you of him sing unto the lord a new song and his praise from the end of the earth ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein the isles and the inhabitants thereof let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice and the villages that kadur doth inhabit let the inhabitants of the rock sing let them shout from the top of the mountains let them give glory unto the lord and declare his praise in the islands the lord shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war he shall cry yea roar he shall prevail against his enemies now i want you to notice the language of jehovah i have longed i have long time holding my peace i have been set still and have refrained myself now now will i cry like a travailing woman and i will destroy and devour at once and now is come salvation and now are we sons and daughters of god now let god have his liberty i've refrained myself so long children [Applause] but now get ready for rapture get ready oh lord jesus now now now will i cry like a travailing woman and i will destroy and devour when you start putting on the garments of phrasing and trading in your asses for beauty and you're mourning in for joy and you start singing a new song it brings god's attentions when you start shouting on the mountains and you start singing in the valleys and you start pulling your hearts off the willow trees and you start calling out and saying let every breath everything that hath breath praise ye the lord i will sing a new song unto the lord i would declare thy mighty works before this wicked generation i will sing i will sing yea i will sing and when you begin to break forth on the right hand and break forth on the left hand then god breaks forth notice now is not some time in the past now is not sometime in the future now is present it's in an instance i happen to believe that all things are possible to them that believe i believe in the most precious name that there is i believe in the one that came to set you free from the bondage of sin i believe in the one that is a cancer killer he's a tuberculosis killer he is an enemy killer and i happen to believe there ain't not one weapon that can stand before you that will prosper and i'd say let god have his liberty let god have his liberty so you can have your liberty let god break through so you can have your breakthrough young girls let me talk to you if you don't have a breakthrough you're gonna get left here if you don't really get serious and stop playing games god will do right by his word young boys it's not a time to play games young and older like it's not a time to play games right now young girls right now young boys this is for every single one of you this message came for you to experience it and experience every fiber of it and experience the liberty of it and you watch him come and vindicate it with the water i'm telling you for you to watch right now you watch what god will do look earnestly intently into the perfect law of liberty i say there's nothing too hard for him if he can roll a boy if he can roll a boy out of a tin can car and bring him out of a lie and bring forth an isaac he's more than able he's more than able to go through every one of every one of the one of your situations he's god for randy hinkle he's god for joe shifflet he's god for jim noel he's god for ray lambert he's god for timmy batten he's god for noah i'd say right now is the time for you to be looking unto him right now's the time for you to confess what you want done right now is a time for you to believe for never for nothing is impossible to them that belief god god they tried to put me away they tried to shut down the ministry and they tried to shut down a message and they tried to shut down my praise they tried to arrest your spirit father but i have come to declare war on hell i will not be pushed into a corner and i will not bow down to the thoughts of men i am here simply as an instrument to be used by almighty god to liberate the sons of god so that they might be dressed in the message of the hour and if you've been living under a shadow maybe a wife telling you you did this or always constantly nagging at you because you made mistakes in your past why don't you stand up and say jesus set me free from those things get off my back a minute maybe if you got a husband that's that's hounding you over certain things maybe what maybe you just rise up just for a minute right there and say wait a minute jesus christ liberated me from that i'm free in the freedom of christ it's not a free to do whatever you want to but it's a freedom to live this message i say this there ain't no hold on this message to a son and daughter of god you can live this message to its entirety you can be what you are which is the seventh seal and you are going to express that on rapture mourning now will i cry now will i break forth well let me start singing because it's a time for manifested sons like never before to stand up and manifest themselves as sons that are fully adopted robed in the robes of jesus christ it's time that you express who you are as a son of god express yourself in school don't you express yourself like some fish fishy and wishy-washy human being that wants to wallow its way through the school and live any way it's want to you express yourself in the message let me tell you if let's let's be audacious right here if they can stand in front of our face and throw their agenda in our face why don't we stand up for our god-given rights that every devil in hell is trying to rock from us and steal from us why don't we stand up for our god-given rights and sisters be sisters and brothers brief brothers let's fight for it we got something to live for i'm sick and tired of satan
