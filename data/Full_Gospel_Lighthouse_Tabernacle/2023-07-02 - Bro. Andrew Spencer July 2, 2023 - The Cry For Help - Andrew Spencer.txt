the inside of us and Lord we we recognize that that's your doing father there's no man that put out a mandate and said you need to be here those things but it is the drawing power of the Holy Ghost

Book of Psalms chapter 27. Psalms chapter 27 and verse 7. amen are you ready for the word this morning Psalms chapter 27 and verse 7. hear O Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when thou said is seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger thou has been my help leave me not neither forsake me or God for my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up teach me thy way O Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of mine enemies deliver me not over under the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses are risen up against me and such are and such as breathe out cruelty I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart wait I say on the Lord may God bless his word he may be seated today in the presence of the Lord we'd like to speak to you today on a thought that the Lord's put on our heart for this morning's service on the Cry The Cry for Help The Cry for Help and the Bible says here in Exodus chapter 2 and 23 that it came to pass that in the process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their Cry came up unto God by the reason of the bondage and God heard their groaning and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob and God looked upon the children of Israel and God had respect unto them Exodus 3 and 1 says now Moses had kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to up and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hi hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where on thou stand this is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I have heard their Cry by reason for of their task Masters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large and unto a land flowing with milk and honey under the place of the Canaanites the Hittites the amorites the parisites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and it's a powerful thing when God says I have heard your cry it doesn't matter where you are these people were in the midst of captivity but God heard their cry there were a million other voices that were crying out in Egypt but God heard the be the specific Cry of his people you see there's something about a mother that that knows the very the very Cry of her child there is something about her that is something that is that is placed on the inside of her it could be in the midst of a other thousand other babies crying but that mother has an instinct that is put on the inside of her that she hears the Cry of her child and she knows she knows when she is when when that child is crying out for help and we realize that we are serving a God that understands everything that each of us go through we're serving a god that is a very caring God he's a god of judgment but yet he's a god of Mercy as well and we serve a God that understands all things before we ever get into the midst of our troubles or the the midst of our calamities we serve of God that is omnipotent that means that he is all-powerful and we serve a god that is omniscient that he knows all things and he sees all things and him being omniscient makes him omnipresent so that we recognize that we cannot go anywhere or do anything without the omniscience of God that has already seen or heard or understands what we are getting ready to go through and we are serving a god that is said that I will never leave you and I will never forsake you we are serving a God that his eyes do not fall and Slumber and his eyes do not fall asleep his eyes run to and fro throughout all the Earth it doesn't matter if it's the president that needs help it doesn't matter if it's the Pauper that needs help he's the god that hears the Cry of his children and if he met the three who brewed children in the midst of a fire he can meet you in the midst of your Calamity or in the midst of your crisis he didn't send an angel down but he came down himself he didn't send down just a it's a weaker Angel but the mighty Angel Michael himself showed up and I want you to know that the god that you're serving today is not a weak God he said God that understands the Cry of his people and even though you might be in a spot where you think well I don't necessarily I don't feel like I'm crying out for help but there is something about our God that understands our future he understands what we're getting ready to go through so he allows us to have a word for a season that we're in so that even though we may not be in a spot of crying right now things might look like they're in a good spot because we're still under the rulership of Joseph but there's coming a time in our future so God has got to deliver all the way out there in our future isn't it wonderful to know that tonight that even when Israel was a limping Prince and he was blind that he had a son that was set up there that had that had somebody that had passed down through his genealogy that was going to take care of them and a man go all the way into a prison cell get sold out get sold out by his brothers be sold out and that men would ridicule him his brothers made fun of him but he was Rose to the second in command in all of Egypt why was this done was because there was a famine that was coming and God was going to take care of his children you see before Joseph ever got in there and he was ever in second man God had a vision that Joseph was going to be there and before you ever got in your condition God had a Prophet come to this land and deliver a word that would get out before you ever got here the god of the Bible is in your future today and before you got in your troubles or before you ever got in this chaos of needing a word that would get you out of the situation that you're in he had a prophetic Ministry deliver a word that has the power to deliver now notice what brother made him says here in the power of God he said Satan's power is limited Faith's power brings the past God's revealed Revelation he said but God helps those who cannot act and help themselves that us that old dishonoring God dishonoring God proverb but said God helps those who helps himself he said how ridiculous God helps those who can't help themselves say Amen isn't he wonderful the power of God what does it the power of God is the only thing that can give eternal life the power of God is the only thing it's the power of God that built a tree all the science in the world can't build a tree God's power built the tree God's power keeps me alive if God calls for you all the hospital and the oxygen tents and the pool motors in the world couldn't keep you here salvation is of the lord it's God it's God's power that feeds the sparrow it's God's power that speaks to the little duck up yonder there is nobody that goes up there and chews him off the lake in Canada and so get go down to Louisiana no sir it's the power that sues him off of that Lake the little fella don't know which way to go but it's God's power that directs him to the South it's God's power that directs them to Jesus Christ it's God's power that brought the wise men to the Cradle it's got power that Thrills the soul of every believer it's God's power to help those who cannot help themself when Lazarus was in his worst of conditions when he was past anybody's worst conditions that are setting here today when he was in a spot when he needed somebody that was bigger than him Jesus showed up late you know you are serving a God that knows how to show up late to a party and still make it the greatest come out you're servant of God that it might look like he isn't coming but there's a God that's in your future he knows how to sew a plate Lazarus his name means without help and Lazarus was within a spot that he needed somebody bigger than him to help him out of his condition Jonah needed somebody to get him out of a belly's well of the will of the belly or the Hallelujah always get that mixed up out of the well out of the wells belly he needed somebody that would get him out of it but there was a God that had a prophecy that it was not going to go down there in destruction but he had a god that knew how to took a whale and put him over there and then of a and deliver the message and God knows how to get you out of the situation of life that you're in God's got a prophetic Ministry that it's in operation in the Church of the Living God you say well the prophet's done gone I'll say this that William Branham said that the real Prophet is the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is the one that can get you out of your situation you ever had a nightmare that you can't shake and you wake up in the morning and you just you're you're soaking wet with with sweat that shit's bothered you you he had this dream it's terrible too it's it's it's it's it's it's it's torn your mind up you can't hardly go to sleep because you need help to get out of it because Satan knows how to attack you in your night Seasons they are in your subconscious when you are not active enough to be able to take the word of God and defeat him so he comes to you in your night seasons and he gives you nightmares but you I want to turn this around that you are Satan's worst nightmare you are everything that Satan hates Satan hates your power Satan hates your Authority Satan hate your praise Satan hates your hallelujahs Satan hates your amen because he knows that if you ever wake up from that moment and you begin to turn around and curse the very devil that his anointed your nightmares he is without help there's a God that'll show up for you but there's nobody that'll back up Satan I don't know if y'all know that or not that's a shouting moment you got somebody that'll back you up brother Timmy you got somebody that'll show up for you when you need him worse than you ever thought but Satan has no backup [Applause] Hallelujah David said in Psalms 18 and 6 in my distress I called upon the Lord and Cried unto my God and he heard my voice out of his Temple and My Cry came before him even unto his ears you see David found him in the midst of his deep distress and danger that he called upon God and he found God ready to help Psalms 34 and 15 the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are upon their cry Psalms 139 and 4 for there is not a word in my tongue but Lo O Lord thou knowest it all together thou has to be sent me behind and before and laid thy hand upon me such a knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high and I cannot attain it wither shall I go from thy Spirit or wither shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend into the heavens Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art they are if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the other most parts of the sea even there even there shall I hand Lead Me thy right hand shall hold me I want you to know there is nowhere that you can go that you can escape the very hand of almighty God if you are his children there is no man there's no devil there's no demon there's no sickness that can pluck you out of the hand of the father if you go to hell he's already there if you go to heaven he's here if you're in laodicea he's there Psalms 107 and 6 then they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he left them all alone he left them and he made them wonder if he was still God or not he delivered them out of their distresses oh brother Bosworth he said that the baby that cries aloud is he gets the most attention so sometimes you just gotta cry grown men cry it ain't just little weak Christians it's him strong Christians that knows the power and crying out to God a real man knows how to call on God a real man is not ashamed to say Lord I got myself in a mess and I can't get myself out of it a real man is not ashamed a real woman is not ashamed to say the problem that I am in I need somebody that's bigger than me to get me out of the chaos that I got myself into I can tell you I dug myself a whole lot of holes in life but there was one that was always willing to pick me up out of it that was one when I was sick he was ready to heal me when I was lost he was ready to save me when I was bound he was ready to deliver me I failed him to be a just God and a holy God and a powerful God he's ready this morning Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] being a parent being a parent it is one of the most difficult things that's having a little baby they don't know how to speak and don't know how to talk and when they're crying out for help you don't know what to do you try to change your diaper you try to give them a bottle you try to feed him try to burp them you try to you try to soothe their soul you try to and all you can do is hug them and sometimes a hug is all that you need you ever gotten a spot where man I just needed a big hug from God I've been there too I want you to know I have found him that he knows how to caress his children but you know that feeling as a mother or a father that you don't know how to wake when they wake up in the middle of the night it's 2 30 in the morning then they're crying and you don't know why whether they had a nightmare whether they're crying for the hungry or whether they're crying for this that or the other you don't know what's going on and you can't imagine that feeling if you never had a child you don't understand because it's a part of you but if you if you have had a child you understand what I'm saying about is because it wakes you up in the middle of the night it tears your nerves up because you can't help them and you feel helpless you want to do everything for them they're so young they need your help and you just you just want to do it for them you're there in that spot and you can't help them and they're crying out for it but all you can do is just be their mother and you might get in the spot and you think my goodness I I feel like I let God raised the wrong person up to raise this child you're the best person you're the best person that God could have chose to raise that little individual it's because they are a part of you they are a part of you and you deposited all that you are on the inside of them and you know how to take care of them you might feel hopeless and you might feel helpless but you're the one that God has chosen to take care of oh you might feel that way but Papa God is right there waiting for you to listen Hallelujah he's waiting for you to call on him father God my little girl my little boy is in this condition and I can't help them out but father I know that you're willing Hallelujah you're not sitting here helpless today you're not sitting here hopeless today that's a God that understands the reason of your cry there's a God that understands why you're asking why you're asking Hallelujah Hallelujah he's a God that sees he's a God that hears Hallelujah he's a God that understands the very first time we ever see Angels appearing in the Bible as they appear to Hagar when God comes when God comes down and Hagar when God when Abraham is protecting Isaac and he pushes out Ishmael and Hagar and he sends them out there with a bottle and they go out there and they're all alone and she's out there crying because she knows she can't take care of him the bottles done ran empty and she can't take care of him so she goes over there and sets him underneath of a bush she puts him underneath the bush and she goes over there about the distance of a bear Arrow a shot of an arrow and she goes away so that she can't hear her baby crying but there was an angel the Lord had appeared unto her and said what is this cry that has came unto me and he came there and there appeared a whale over there a whale appeared for Hagar and if God heard the hair if he heard the Cry Of The Ponds woman how much more shall he hear the Cry of the free woman you recognize who you are today you're not a child of the bonds woman you're not a child of the slave you're the child of the most high God you're not wearing him out by asking him over and over again he's thanking you you're giving him the opportunity for the pillar of fire to show up well so I'm getting tired of asking God ain't tired of giving God ain't tired of listening God ain't tired of you calling out to him that's what he built you for it's so that you could call out to him if he didn't need the Savior he'd have never became a savior if he didn't need to hear you he'd have never put ears upon his upon his body but he's got to hear his children why did he let me get in this condition Joe and display his power you wouldn't understand what it's like to know him as a God that saves unless you got in the condition that you're in Hallelujah that's a lot of people that don't understand him as a God that saves her a God that delivers because they never experienced him but to you that have known him you can stand here as a witness of the power of the Holy Ghost surely surely if he was up there and he had a man up there on the moon on the backside of a desert by the name of Moses that was going to have a conference with him and he was going to talk to him about these two million Israelites that are down there and they're in captivity surely he's got a god surely he's got somebody that's going to hear you see this conference that it was taking place upon that mountain was in direct line of a conference that took place as Genesis chapter 15 that thy seed is going to sojourn in a Strange Land you see God had promised that his seed was going to sojourn there but he was awaiting for a time where the deliverer would come and because of Moses's intellectual ideas he calls the children of Israel 40 more years and he was back there on the backside of the day of sir and he was finding out what God really meant for his life you see Moses was born for this purpose his mama told him about it his mama told him that you're a deliverer and she said I know how how God saved y'all the now infested where the crocodile River I understand that there's a special call upon your life I met the I met the angel of the Lord their father met him a prayer when he was talking to him said God we've we've been here for so long so long where's our deliver at but there the vision of the Lord dropped down into Moses's family and he showed him that there was a deliverer coming and he said mama mama said I know that you're the one Moses I know that you're the deliverer I've done seen a special call upon your life I've seen how God got you out of trouble I've seen how God got you out of that mess I've seen how the Lord's worked on your life but that just having that intellectual knowledge was not enough for Moses to deliver the children of Israel he had to go back there on the back side of the desert and meet the budding beat the burning bush for himself you see you see God was trying to get his attention of Moses he was trying to get the attention of his Prophet so all of a sudden that Pillar of Fire Dropped Out of Heaven fell upon fell upon that bush and the Bush was not consumed what's because there was a conference that was getting ready to take place between Moses and the god of the Bible that was going to say that he heard the children's cry and you know that brother Bynum said that the church is in bondage he said the church is in bondage of sickness he said the church is crying and been crying for years for deliverance but that same Pillar of Fire that that swooped out of Heaven has swooped down into this building today you might be crying for deliverance you might be crying for help but the pillar of fire is your answer and the devil might tell you there is no help for you there is no relief there's no way out of your problem the devil every single time he opens his mouth he's lying there ain't never been a time that the devil opened his mouth that he ever told the truth but God over and over 8800 times throughout the Bible he promised us something and it came to pass the devil made promises nine times in the Bible and every single time they failed because that the devil is a liar you see Old Slew Foot don't know nothing but nothing but to do is to lie he cannot create so he perverts he tries to destroy and he tries to create so he destroys more and more and more but if you're going to listen to a devil's lie I'd sure listen to one better than saying that you're not qualified or you're not elect [Music] because there's a God that says you are qualified and there is a God that says you are the elect so if you're going to listen to a devil's lie you better listen to something stronger than that but I don't believe you have to listen to any lie that the devil's got to tell you that you got to deal with sickness or you got to deal with this pain you got to deal with this crime baby you got to deal with this situation I believe that there's an answer there's an answer brother man said that to believe the devil's lie is to serve Satan so be careful what you allow the enemy to whisper in your ear and tell you these things and tell you what you're not good enough and you're not going to make it because if you listen to him you're showing that you're serving him he said why are you preaching the way you're preaching it's because I'm not going to allow one ounce of me to ever show that the devil's winning it doesn't matter how I feel it doesn't matter what I see it doesn't matter what I'm facing I'm going to stand here and I'm going to confess the word of God no matter what I see no matter what I feel no matter what you're going through let me tell you if you call me and you are in midst of trial you don't want me guessing you don't want me presuming you want somebody that knows what they're talking about if you get in a condition and you're about to die and you feel like it's a premature grave that's coming by your way you're gonna have one or something want to know somebody that knows that there's a power of life that can get you out of a premature grave you're not calling on somebody that doesn't know their God you're calling on somebody that's got authority of an office of a priesthood that recognizes that's what God in heaven today what was it Moses had heard about it but now he knew that there was a god down there heard about it from his mama's testimony but now he knew because he met him now you know you know good and well that you was in that spot in your condition of life where you'd heard about a God that healed you heard about a God that saved but when you've really found out that he's a God that hears you cry you became personal with him you see the Holy Ghost is a personal experience not something that's emotion it is and experience Hallelujah you see you can't focus on the things that you're seeing you can't focus on the problems that you're seeing I I aren't focused to see what Satan wants us to you see our eyes are focused by the word of the Lord to see the will of the word because our faith that God has dropped on the inside of our hearts and revealed to us is designed to see what God wants but brother random said the trouble of it is tonight that we got too many Christian people that's professing Christians that's got one eye on the world and the other one on the cross you'll fall as sure as a world he said let your eyes be single let your heart be single let your thoughts be single he said brother that rubs in but that hurts he said but it's good for you you see you can't serve God and serve Mammon at the same time you've got to let your eyes be single upon the word of God well back I got these new glasses I got out the shower and I put these new glasses on I thought dear Lord I'm going blind I couldn't see anything I didn't say nothing to Katie because I didn't I thought God had mercy I need help I couldn't see nothing I I had to watch tumbled around that's a dangerous thing to do I stumbled around I laid down for a minute thought man I don't got one of them migraines I never had a migraine in my life and I thought dear God it's going to hit me I didn't turn 35 didn't return 36 and things are starting to turn mad on me oh downhill now one I didn't realize is this big old dummy right here had his contacts in and tried to put his glasses on at the same time and I couldn't focus on the things that I was looking at and the problem was I couldn't see clearly where I was going because I had a double lens over top of my eyes and anytime that you got a double lens over top of the word of God you're not going to see the word of God correctly if you ever look into the Bible and you see three Gods you need to focus that thing down just a little bit tighter so that you see there's only one God you see you might be in that condition and all you're seeing is the problem and all you're seeing is a situation but if you can focus that thing on down there and really see what you're looking at you're seeing at an opportunity that's what God looks at your problems like their opportunities for him to show up stop looking at your problems as chaos in crisis look at your problems as an opportunity to bless the Holy One of Israel he's a pharaoh looked upon them out there out the same window but he's seen slaves he said but Moses seen the victory why he had focused himself though being a prince though through the air or air to the throne of Egypt he had focused himself away from the lust of the world he focused himself away from the beauty of power and he he had within his own potentials to receive that but he focused that out brother random said that Pharaoh had those same pharaohs did not Pharaoh did not have those potentials but he looked out the same window and he didn't see the same result as Moses saw you see he was offered it but he refused it and when he refused it then he couldn't focus it and he said no man after he's turned down the word of God can ever Focus itself into it because he refused the word that brings you in the relationship of Christ but you see what faith was doing for Moses the Revelation that Moses had is that those were the children of Abraham and Abraham being back there all of those years there was a prophecy that was still rolling you don't understand it but the cogs of Prophecy are rolling this morning they might roll slow but they're sure and you may not understand why you're going why why you're going through what you're going through a lot of times it's just the current thermometer or the temperature of laodicea that we're in it ain't always you it's the world that you're living in it's a demographics that you're in but our faith is like Moses is Faith we're designed to look past the things of what we see out there in the natural we're designed to see what God's will is and what he wants you're seeing when that Faith that's in you can focus you to the word you're focused away from the denominational Creeds and everything your focus right straight on the word of God you're zeroed in it only needs a little touch off amen that prayer flies straight into the presence of God because there's nothing to stop it yes that's what does it when you're zeroed in with God focused in by then you're looking at the Target you're not looking at what somebody else says this can't happen and that can't happen you're looking to what you did know happened you're focused to see if there's an angel that comes down at a certain season it begins to trouble the water and you might be laying there for 38 years in your infirmity in your condition and you can look at that problem you can Circle that mountain all those days and thinkers nobody going to help you get in but if I can give you a glimpse into your future there's one that's walking there's one that's walking by your pool today and you might be waiting for the right moment you might be waiting for the right season you might be waiting for the troubling of the waters I don't want to tell you're in it you're not waiting to get in the water you're in the water so how do you know that because I'm watching the effects of the water so what do you mean brother Andrew brother random told us that Waters represent people and we are watching the effect of the word take a hold of your life how how did we this just really must blow Satan's mind how do we get terabires into this circle how do we get Stephen Byers into this circle what was it it was the effect of the angel and you look out there and say well how does this one getting in and how's that one getting in how are they getting delivered it's the effects of the angel in the water it's not the water you ain't got nothing to do with it but it's the Angel that's on the water and the same angel that was with William Branham is upon the people today and you're under the influence not a weak Angel but under the influence of a mighty angel and you might have walked in here one way today but you're gonna walk out of here completely different today because the effect of the Angel is operating in this room he might have laid there for all those years but the day's a new day I'm going to say to you like Jesus said pick up your bed and walk stop playing that in your condition stop crying on your pillar pick yourself up and walk with Jesus you can lay there if you want to but Jesus has already done the work you can cry all you want to you can have a pity party all you want to but get up and follow him out of the building Hallelujah I cried all those years but it was worth it I laid those on all those years it was worth it Hallelujah Abraham I've seen your faith I've seen that you trust me I've seen that you love me when I'm gonna put your faith to a test do you really believe me when I ask you to lay your Isaac down do you still believe me come on Church it's Flesh and Blood now it gets where it's real thick when God's asking you to lay your own flesh down it's getting real thick to it you better know the god that you're serving when God's asking you to lay your life down and the thing that you love with all of your life lay your family down lay your job down lay yourself lay your whole life down you better know the god that you're serving what he's asking for you you see the god that I'm serving is a God that turns it around and blesses you a hundredfold but you see if you don't recognize a God that I'm serving you're going to walk into this trial and you're going to walk in they're afraid but if you know the god that I'm talking about you can walk up there on Mount Moriah and be unafraid you can go up there with Isaac and know that you're coming down with Isaac or you can go up there and doubt him you can doubt that God changed your body you can doubt that he made a message come by your way you can doubt the melchizer that came by your way you can doubt all these things and and just walk off of there or you can go up on that mountain with Melchizedek and you can come down with Melchizedek you can walk up there with Isaac and come down with Isaac and when Abraham had proved himself to Father God and made the sacrifice he had the wood he laid Isaac out there Isaac was of age of 12 years old he knew the power of worship he understood what it was like he said father here's the wood here's the fire but where's the sacrifice but when he understood the call of the father upon his life he was Under The Obedience of the sacrifice because obedience greater than sacrifice put yourself there put your wife out there on that table put your son out there on that table put your daughter out there on that table oh come on now Satan's wanting them Satan's wanting to morrisoned than what you think you you'd understand Satan is wanting them if you read the news this week the lgbtqz said that they're coming after our children they said they're coming after our children Satan wants her children so if Satan's wanting them whose hands you're going to put them into now come on you got to lay them down one way or the other lay them on God's sacrifice or lay them on Satan sacrifice I'm not going to serve the life of devil I'm not going to serve him I'm going to put my child upon the word of God that can get them out of the problem that they're in come on now if he was God that gave you Isaac he's a God that's going to take care of Isaac you may not understand the backside of this desert experience but there is a promise there's a promise that's coming out of it that thy seed shall possess the Gate of autonomous because you obeyed me Abraham if you trust me I'll use you like never before and Abraham made the sacrifice ready and he heard the Cry of a ram and a thinking what was it he is Jehovah Jireh he's a God that provides I read a story years ago came my memory in the last couple weeks here there's a man by the name of Peter richly he was he was traveling he was traveling back and forth and he was headed from Australia to England back and forth that way and he got out on his ship and and the ship rent he was the only Survivor on that ship and there was another ship that came by and they rescued Peter richly out of this out of the waters there and Peter richly gets up there and he tells him what happened he was the only Survivor out of it this happened to Peter richly again same thing happened to him again he gets on the third boat and he tells him same story this goes on and happens five times true story happens five times to him he gets up there on a ship that's called the city of Leeds he gets up there he gets up there and he he gets up there and he tells it he tells the captain of the ship he tells him it's crazy story like man he's like this happened to me he said five times has happened I'm the only Survivor he said it's an odd feeling it's an odd feeling you're the only one there and he said God it must be saving me for some purpose and so Peter richly gets checked out by the doctor on the ship and he looks over and everything's clear and everything and they said so the physician said not look he said he said he said everybody on the ship and he said there's a lady on this ship that's she's dying she's been asking for her son to come and and Lord save my son before I die Lord save my son and she said he said the cat or the physician said now look everybody on the ship knows this lady they know this lady and she knows them and said you know maybe you could just play the part maybe you just go in there and play the part and try to act like her son and so that she can pass away easily there he said well sure he said he saved my life he took care of me he fed me he said I'll do whatever I got to do he goes in and he he's standing there and he walks in there's this there's this lady that's laying in the bed and she's just moaning God save my son God save my son Jesus she's there at the point of expiring there and the physician nudges Peter and he goes on up there and he goes around there and he goes to say Mom I'm here but he didn't have to play the part because that was his mama and there was a mama that was praying Lord save my son Lord save my son I don't know why I'm here but I'm here you might be in that condition today and you might think what in the world is God saving me for why is he you might have went through five shipwrecks but God's got a purpose in your life you might be that Mama that's still on the bed crying God save my son God save my son God save my son five times in shipwreck but God was a God that knew how to take care of him if God can take care of a man that was Shipwrecked how much more can he take care of the Church of the Living God you are built for a purpose and there's more than a mama that's crying out there's father God laughs Lord have mercy on me he's heard your claw blind Lord of his and even though people's trying to shut you up people try to say you're Pentecostal people's trying to say you're being too loud but Bartimaeus cried the more because the father heard your cry Hallelujah the father heard your crying your nervousness the father heard your cry in your complexes the father heard your cries in Parenthood Hallelujah foreign that woman immediately as soon as she seen her son that God had saved her son God restored her health and they went back to Australia as a family again Hallelujah Hallelujah might be divided and you might be abused you might go through complexes and you might go through her circumstances but I want you to know that you're walking out of here in this situation that you're in under the economy of the family of almighty God but Satan's after me brother Andrew don't you worry God's faster than Satan don't you worry God's bigger than your problem don't you worry God's bigger than your sickness God's bigger than your own self Hallelujah Hallelujah I have heard the Cry of my people and I am come down to deliver them I don't care where you are I don't care what sin you're in I don't care what trouble you're in you have waited patiently come on now Shake Yourself a minute Shake Yourself a minute I'm on Samson they got you in that pit for a reason because you let them get you in that pit but Shake Yourself I'm gonna shake yourself you know you are built to be a real Pentecostal you were built to be in real Apostolic Church you were built to be an invisible Army but Satan got you in the snare but you are built for a purpose to destroy Philistines and just because your eyes are gone doesn't mean that your power is gone and it might look like the Satan's got the battle that he's got to battle an array and he's winning the battle but all along Samson's hair was growing out again what is it you recognize that the Covenant was for you you might have messed up but the covenant's still there anybody else feeling what I'm feeling in here today it's time to put your hands on the pillars and push them over on the Philistines they've been lying on you they've been making fun of you put your power to work I'm sorry this is the only way I know how to preach if I could preach it better I would what are you doing brother Andrew I'm after this Old Devil and I might be wild and I might be crazy but I'm not giving up on you I see Donnie Nicholson crying for help I got a right to fight for that when I see these young people fighting through lay Odyssey I got a right to fight for that I got right to fight for it should Satan put us in the pawn shop he put us in her but God came and paid for us and we got a receipt in our hand by looking at the cross that the blood has already paid for you and I and you ain't got to listen to him no more you ain't got to listen to him you ain't got to go back under set on the Shelf no more he might have put you in the pawn shop but God's got you out you remember when brother Brandon was sick and he had that sickness in his body he had that he had that had that he got like he got exposed to that gas leak and he had that sickness in his stomach and it just kept on confessing that he was healed he kept eating beans and he kept eating that cornbread and every single time a trip it kept trying to come back up he just kept saying I'm Healed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by his stripes I'm Healed and Satan said well you're doing nothing but lying and bringing an approach on the name of Jesus Christ and he said Satan if you don't like that just stick around here he said I gotta write to it I got a right to thank him for it I gotta write to my healing I gotta write to my daughters I gotta write to this church family I gotta write to our pastor I gotta write to Donnie Nicholson I gotta write to Randall Griffith I gotta write to Brother Martin I gotta write for you and I'm not going to back off any of these blood-bound promises because I know the god that I'm serving don't have no give up in him and if he ain't got no give up then I ain't got no give up I gotta write for you today Jesus Paid the price I ain't got to pay for you you ain't got to pay for it the father has heard thy cry [Applause] thank you you know what it's like to spend your nights in prayer and you soak your pillow with tears because you're crying over a situation God sees that he sees that you're not no worse than Lazarus you're not no worse than Jerry's daughter you're not no worse than Georgia Carter Georgie Carter laid there for nine years 47 pounds because her uncle was taking her to piano lessons and he ravished her and because of that because of that emotional distress upon her body TB attacked itself to her she laid there because somebody did the wrong deed to her you can lay there in your condition because somebody did you wrong or you can believe that God sent a prophet you can lay there you can lay in your pity you can lay in your condition George and Carter had rung those bed posts nearly off in her Agony and her pain crying but she was under the leadership of a denomination that believed that the days of Miracles were passed but she got a hold of a little book she got a hold of her little book and you might be sitting here and thinking why in the world am I here but God's got handfuls on purpose for you Georgie you heard about a testimonial about a little nail girl how did she got out of her condition and if you could do it for her he can do it for you and he had a prophet all the way down there in Indiana I said he heard the Cry of a little sheep dying in the wilderness there was a little girl I play her in Milltown that was crying for help and he knows where his sheep is today and they're crying for help and he knows Hallelujah Hallelujah I don't know if you know this today but today is a special day for you today's a special day for you today's a new day for you today's a new day for you the vision broke through your cry has awoken the master it might have looked like it wasn't coming it might have looked like it was never coming by their way but Georgie there was a prophet praying a player and the Briar's hitting him in the face but the angel of the Lord got through thank you I might have wore it all night but maybe I wore it all night for you but your cry has went to father Georgie the Lord Jesus has looked on you Full Gospel Lighthouse our Lord Jesus Christ has looked on your need and he's counted too worthy to stand not just stand there in defeat not just stand there and criticism not to stand there in sickness but to rise in Victory Georgie Carter in a matter of moments is out there picking up grass and playing the piano because somebody heard her cry God is on my trail Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah remember brother Brandon was dealing with that nervousness he's dealing with that nervousness in his body and he had that Vision concerning his had that Vision concerning that his healing brother was going down through the street and he's Shadow Boxing I'm sorry I'm trying to make sure which word I'm in right now he's going down the street and he's Shadow Boxing and he's Shadow Boxing and he's he sees this big dog this big black dog come up to him and he and he's he's coming up there and he he comes up right beside him brother hollers at that dog so get away from me dog now that dog raised this big old Burly man he said you called me a dog and brother man said I apologized to him so I apologize he said I didn't know who he was I didn't know he was a man I thought she was a dog he said you called me a dog so you call me a dog you called me a dog and he said that big Burly man he stood up there and he brother Branham said he said he was so he's so big and he said he backed me up against the Culvert backing me up against a quarter there he pulled that man pulled out a big old knife and said I'm gonna kill you I'm gonna kill you he said at that moment he said I'm not afraid to die he said Jesus Christ is my savior and my healer I'm not afraid to die he said and when I said that he said there came a noise from Heaven he said and Out of Heaven came an angel and stood by my side Hallelujah he said he stood by my side and he stood there didn't say a word but he looked at that man with a knife in his hand that man dropped that knife and ran away from him what was it the angel was his protection let me tell you you might go through the worst of conditions but the angel I've heard a noise from heaven and suddenly there came a rush Like A Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting in yes there was a man that had a knife in his hand but there was a power that was poured out on the day of Pentecost yes we had sin on our Trail but there was an angel that stood by our side blessed be the name of the Lord Hallelujah Hallelujah he loves you he loves you he loves you I can't do it on my own brother Andrew I can't win this battle on my own why don't you let the mighty Angel just stare at thing down come on now you don't fault that thing all you're by yourself why don't you let the mighty Angels tear that thing down you've been looking that in the face and it's been whispering in your ear and telling you all kinds of Lies why don't you let the mighty angel look at that thing one time because when the mighty angel looks at the Devil he's got nowhere to run he is exposed he's got no backup he's got no power he's got no Authority you're tired of looking at it turn the mighty Angel loose on him turn the power of the Seven Seals loose on him turn the power of restoration loose on him you're not a weak child Hallelujah you got that scripture says I'm Opera I had to put my glasses back on this foreign give me kgv first please songs 40 and 1. stand with me I waited patiently for the Lord I waited patiently for him I waited patiently for the Lord and he had climbed unto my ear and heard my cry that's a God that you're serving and he brought me up also out of the horrible pit and out of the Myra clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my Goings and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our God many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the Lord Now give me the passion translation for the pure and Shining one a song a poetic praise you know where the greatest inspiration comes is dark moments just go to studying out Eddie perronet songs and go studying out some of the greatest songs that are written in history they're written in the most darkest dungeons where did Paul write his best scriptures Dale it's not a Philippians I waited and waited and waited some more how many been there patiently knowing that God would come through for me then at last he bent down and listened to My Cry and he stooped down to lift me up out of danger from the desolate pit I was in and out of the muddy mess I had fallen into now he lifted me up into a firm and secure place and steadied me wow I walked along the ascending path a new song for a new day Rises up in me every time I think about it how he breaks me through for me is static praise pours out of my mouth until everyone hears how God has Set Me Free many will see his miracles they'll stand in awe of God and fall in love with him because your chaos because you're bit many will fall in love with him because of me but I don't want to go through these things I don't want to go through my trial I'm ready to get out of it God has a purpose and your shipwrecks God has a purpose for you up on Mount Moriah that's a purpose for your daughter dying and slipping off to sleep go purpose because God wants to display his power as many times as many times throughout this past three and a half years I ask the Lord God if I could I'd take that from them and I'd put it on me I'd bear that for them I'd bear that for my dad I'd bear that for that one I bear for this one I'd go through that for them but he always comes back with the same reply you don't have to do that I already stop crying yourself to sleep and put on the oil Joy it's time to turn your morning into praise I'm still in my chaos turn into praise turn loose that ecstatic praise that'll turn somebody towards the father I'm still in trouble I'm still in my chaos turn loose your praise [Laughter] there's one thing I've learned in life I'm much of a Preacher but I am a worshiper I ain't much of an orator and I ain't a man that can put together much scripture and much quotes and no sayings but I know how to worship and if that's all that I've got to give God I'm going to learn to worship like nobody else can worship I'm Gonna Learn To Praise my way through and if there's one thing I've learned about worship it's when you don't feel like worshiping and it's when you don't look like the problems getting answered that's the time to praise him when it don't look like he's heard to cry that's the time to thank him for the answer foreign you got me you got me today you talked to me today you heard me thank you Lord don't give up because if you give up right now you're gonna always give up bro Jonathan sent me something a while back said you could always win a battle but you could never win a surrender you give up and you surrender you'll never be able to get out of it but if you keep battling you can win you can win don't give up well you got that last when you have that last breath here's your cry Connie he heard you cry two months ago two months ago I don't know how you was gonna be here but two months ago he showed me me preaching this service with you in it I'd say he's heard you cry how are you here how are you in this room how'd you get where you are you are in a vision before you ever got into trouble before you ever got in your situation it heard you it heard you but it's always heard you since Annie's heard

low we've been manure for a moment but joy is Joy is coming in the morning Hallelujah the spirit of the Lord is upon me for he has anointed me to preach to tell you that the Captivity of Israel is over it's time that you trade in your ashes for beauty and it's time that you turn your feet to dancing the spirit of the Lord is here to say I have heard thy cry thank you you're not wearing him out are you sufficiently impressed with his presence are you sure that when you take your petitions before him you know that you can ask all things of God and he will give the very desires of the heart are you sufficiently impressed with his word that if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you do you really believe that when you can't he can father God we're in a very special moment father when you woke me up this morning and changed my course I studied I studied I put hours of study in I slept I dreamed about these thoughts that I was thinking about preaching I spent many hours praying about it just like I always do but this morning you woke me up and said today's a special day father we feel hopeless sometimes and we feel helpless but when we were at our weakest that's when we're made strong father who is this old great Mountain that stands before zeroom and I shall be made like a plane it's not by our Midas not by our power but by the spirit oh Lord when cancer is riding and it's trying to Triumph all of our Victory we will rise up more than conquerors when troubles and distress come by our way we will lift our eyes the ones that help towards the hill where our help comes from you are our everything and you are all Lord there's nothing I can point your children to that's greater than you no matter what they're in no matter the condition that they face no matter what they're facing God you are their help and you are their stay when William Branham was in a spot when he was lost to walking around Hurricane Mountain and he thought he had it all figured out for himself heard a word say I'm a very present help in a time of trouble father if you could just put your hand upon us today and let us turn our back and see the mountain clearly so that we know which direction to walk in we've been walking in clouds and we've been walking around this death Circle for so long and we need help oh God just turn our Direction may we lift our hands towards the heaven where our help is and may we grab a hold of the line that'll lead us back to everything that is true and dear to our hearts oh God you all our help and you are our refuge you are our strength you are our buckler you are our you are our you are our protector you are our Defender you are everything father we commit Our Lives into your hands you heard My Cry but I Cry it's not going up to a god that is death towards us you're the god that sees if you saw Hagel how much more do you see us the other women might look like our well was empty but you've just told us to get into the channels of it Lord mother I turned my mouth loose to Praise You In This Moment I thank you for the opportunity to go through this trial I thank you for the opportunity that you counted me worthy to stand temptation I thank you Lord Jesus that you counted me worthy that I could stand and call and confess that you're the god that heals and you're the god that delivers thank you for healing our brother Donnie Nicholson and touching his body oh God when he's crying out for help and he's in pain and he's in agony you're the god that hears every single pain whether we speak it or whether we don't Paul said in the Book of Romans that you the spirit makes intercessions for our groanings when the things that we can't even speak and utter you know what we mean from our heart Lord Jesus father thank you for the opportunity thank you for the opportunity to recognize you as a Healer there's a God that delivers there's a God that sees and understands so father we won't be silent amen do you love the Lord Hallelujah Hallelujah you ask for it how many squirrels you're asking for Billy Branham three but when you can't find but two are you gonna give up you remember he said I was I was about to give up looking going he said but the angel turned me said but you asked for three just because you see part of the problem has come to pass don't give up on the rest of what you've asked let the Fulfillment ever come after all I've taught you asked big things and ask specific things and when you ask those specific things you put details upon it that only you can ask you'll know that it was God Sister Crystal asked for a specific job I told her to ask for something big and ask for something specific and she knew that God had answered her prayer because of the specific things come to pass how many here has been said those same prayers you asked for certain things you ask for big things when it didn't look like things were coming but you asked anyway and because you were sufficiently impressed with this President you asked Hallelujah I don't believe it's anything too big for our God let us let us Worship the Lord for a moment let the musicians come I may be saying that song created me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me oh God crying ain't always a bad thing a lot of people look on crying as defeat and there's a statement that said that Satan saw me with my head down and thought I was defeated and then I said amen crying Ain't a Bad Thing crime is a very powerful thing [Music] the day is a special day whether you want to accept this or not but today's a special day because there's something that has broke through in this atmosphere the angels of God have gathered in this room you don't see it
