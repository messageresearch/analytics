hands who loves to you stays Hallelujah aren't you thankful for the love of God amen let's just go to the one who taught us how to love our lord Jesus father we come before you today Lord Jesus Lord our hearts Lord Jesus Rejoice because we can understand the power of love we can understand the how it is or to be able to express love Lord what we are able to express to our family and to our children father and the only reason that we are able to express love is because you first loved us father when we seem so unlovable you loved us father and Lord what a privilege it is to know you in the power of your Resurrection father that when we felt worthier when we felt or unworthy or lovable or unlovable whether the emotions of the day were running High running low you were there always always there holding us father clinging unto us Lord Jesus because you are determined that you are going to get thy seed father and Lord we just come here today Lord Jesus to once again father Lord to to water the seed lord of the word father to Lord Our lives our soul lord we Hunger for More Of You father Lord you said bless her you that seek and that are hungry and thirsty for you shall be filled you shall be you shall be filled in your life father and that's what we are Lord we are hungry people father we desire to see the manifestation of the Holy Ghost Lord working Upon Our Lives Lord we we desire father to be cleansed by the by the preaching of the word Lord and we know that by the preaching of the word that there is very powerful things that happen Lord Lord we recognize that while Peter spoke one time that the Holy Ghost fell he didn't lay hands on anybody he didn't have a prayer line he didn't have an altar call but while he spoke those words Lord we recognize that even at the preaching of the word now father that special Miracles can take place father needs in our bodies things in our mind Lord that Lord we just need to get rid of father or to be more like you those those little things father sometimes we're not necessarily sinful but yet we're still human father and we desire Lord that whatever is unlike you father we pray that you would take the word father and you'd begin to scrub it off of our life Lord Jesus and Lord we'll be careful to serve you because that's that's what we do Lord we love you for your word upon our life and Lord I pray your blessings upon this congregation every person that has had their work week father differences of Life the things that they've come from I pray that we will just get together in one mind here just now Lord under the same inspiration father and that we would just get in tune with Heaven Lord and you could speak to us as your children now God will be careful to serve you praise and ask God do you be with the services here tonight there in Edmonton father we pray your blessings be upon our pastor use him in a special way father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening would like to look over in the Gospel of John chapter 3 verse 1 the Gospel of John chapter 3 and verse 1. amen John chapter 3 and verse 1 and there was a man of the Pharisee Nicodemus name Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him now notice the the scene that is set before us here is a a ruler of the Jews it's not just not just one of the boys but this is a ruler of the Jews he's got a hierarchy in his office and he comes to Jesus at night time because he recognized the authority that he has that he could easily lose his position by coming to one that does these Miracles there's a whole lot of talk about going around Jesus now he's already had his miracles that are transpiring in his life and people are beginning to get rumors are beginning to get stirred but here is somebody that is acquainted with the scripture but recognizes that there is some Authority that is behind this man Jesus for he said for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him so we've got to give Nicodemus some credit here he recognizes God in the man and Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and Nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter into enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born can you imagine how absurd this sounds to Nicodemus this is a man that knows all the scriptures but he never read anything like this laying there and Jesus answered and said verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of the water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee ye must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou heareth to the sound thereof but can't tell once it cometh and wither It Go of soul is everyone that is born of the spirit and Nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be and Jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of Israel and Noah's not these things verily verily I say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that what we have seen and ye receive not our witness if I have told you Earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if I tell you of heavenly things may God bless his word he may be seated here in the presence of the Lord and we we would like to just speak to you just for a few moments tonight on Representatives representatives of Heaven representatives of heaven and we all know what it's like to stand into the face of the wind and feel feel the effects of the wind and it doesn't take it doesn't take long for you to recognize when the wind is blowing especially when we've got heat like we've been having for the past few days but we recognize that that we need a cool breeze to blow across our lives to cool us off in the In the Heat of the day but it's like it's like this it's it's like somebody telling you that there's that there's heat out there and how hot it is but yet they haven't stepped outside at all to tell you how hot it is they've never felt the effects of it but here Jesus Is Telling Nicodemus I have felt the effects and the reason that you are seeing these things is because the effects of who I am is being transpired upon the needs that you're seeing and here Jesus begins to talk to him about about a birth a birth that Nicodemus does and understand because he isn't he isn't fully capturing what Jesus is speaking about and here he tells him he said unless you be born again you cannot understand you cannot see the very kingdom of God you sow you see it matters where your birth from so if it didn't matter then Jesus if this didn't matter at all Jesus would have never started out his Doctrine with this but this is the keynote doctrine of all that Jesus came and preached because if you are not born again you cannot understand the things that Jesus is going The Parables that he's getting ready to break down through throughout all of his ministry if you don't have this key Ministry or this key Doctrine down you're not going to understand what Jesus is preaching about now notice that the Bible said in second Corinthians 3 and 2 that you are you are our Epistles Written In Hearts known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be in Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart now notice what brother Bynum says here in the message influence he said then we never know just what we're doing what influence what we're doing it's is having upon others the Bible said we are written Epistles read of all men he said that is your life reads so loud to the public until your testimony if it's contrary to the life it's without any effect it's what you are inside of you that people read not so much what you say but what you are see you can pin something on somebody and say this that and so forth but your life being different from what they say your testimony of your life is louder than the testimony that someone could say something about you yeah so so just keep that on mind that that on your mind that we're bringing influences every day and the life that you live prove proves what's on the inside of you you cannot change that it reflects every person reflects outside what he is inside and if we take the testimony of being a Christian and I think that is one of the most solemn things that a man or a woman or a boy or girl could do or would when he takes on the name of Christ that he's going to be a representative of Christ that you should watch every move you make because somebody is watching you it's the most solemn thing that you can do is to take on the name of the Lord because you are then being a representative of our Lord Jesus Christ so it is the most solemn thing that you can do here is a prophet of the age saying to us the most solemn thing that you can do is take on the name of the Lord and when you take it on watch every move that you make because somebody is watching you you may be here tonight the only Bible that every anybody will ever read out there and lay ought to see anymore because they have not read their Bibles you are a walking testimony of what the Bible says there'll be a lot of people that never listen to William Branham but they see the message of the hour working on your life because something happened on the inside so it expresses on the outside of what the message is you don't have to preach them a sermon just leave them a sermon I have found in my Ministry and throughout my life you ain't got to give them 17 tapes and you ain't got to give them all these tracks you just live on the message it's the best witness that there ever has been and there is no greater witness or no greater advertising than word of mouth and when you begin to testify without saying one word how great Jesus is it is the most powerful testimony that there can be now I'm not saying that there aren't things that you can't hand out and there'll be a blessing to people but your life is the most powerful testimony that there is now this word representative it means to exhibit exhibit a similitude or bearing the character or power of another so it is as a council is representative of the people so it's like it's you that you that have factory work or you that work for different companies that company that has hired you a people that worked for that company it speaks of the Integrity of that company or the place that you work for or the business that you work for you see if you see people that are working for such and such type of a law firm or a different Factory you see what kind of people that that company is after you see a company that's hiring all all Burly men you can understand that there is there's some hard labor that's behind it but if you see a company that's just hiring anybody because they need to fulfill positions and maybe it's like a fast food restaurant by the name of McDonald's they're just hiring anybody and everybody because they know that it's just to feel in position and they know they won't be there long so they just want somebody there they don't need a whole lot of brains down there to work at McDonald's and I'm not talking about anybody that works down there at McDonald's I don't know how McDonald's always makes it into my repertoire but it does somehow but anyways but McDonald's is looking for somebody that that can just feel the position but if you look at a place of business or it doesn't have to be McDonald's could be anywhere it could be Walmart or anywhere else but you see a company that is hiring out all kinds of people that are maybe just maybe not high in regard maybe not this that or the other maybe not somebody that has intellects you can tell what kind of company that that you're working for by the position that they're wanting to feel but you see a company that has high regards they've got high standards they're looking for these qualities or or they're looking for this characteristic in this one or they're looking for maybe maybe somebody of a stature that has an intellect or been to college they're looking for certain things in the people that they're going to employ because you see the people that work for the company no matter what the name is it testifies of the company's status it testifies of its of its statement of faith when you hire out when you hire out somebody they're looking for somebody that can carry on the same statement of faith that they believe in they've got to process they've got things that they believe in they got their they've got their qualities of what they're looking for and when they can find somebody that they can hire and put into that position that they are they recognize that they will represent the company in good times and in bad times in slow times and in busy times that this person has the character that we are looking for to be a representative of a company and the higher that you go in the in the pyramid at the higher that you go there are there are less spots up there there there are certain jobs that there's all kinds of people that can work on those jobs but there is only a certain tier of workplaces that allow that there is only a select people that have certain degrees have certain attributes about them that can be hired and then that company spends so much time looking over those individuals looking over their life and looking over where they came from they they look at their family history they they look at their where they went to school at because they're looking for somebody that's got some class to them is that right because they want somebody that can represent their company if they're not there they want somebody that can step in and be a feeling and can have the same mindset as the boss does because they are looking for somebody that can be a representative of the company and when somebody recognizes that or they see that power or that quality in that individual the company can put put all of its power all of its Authority behind that employee because it represents who they are as a company don't you recognize that Jesus has not just chosen anybody but he's chosen the elect of almighty God that he can put his power in that he can put them and make them sons and they know what he wants done with the word you see he's not just pulling anybody off the street he's pulling his elect now that word that word of is a very powerful very powerful word it's real short but it's real powerful it word that word means from or out of it means to proceed from The Source or the author or the agent that is bestowing that is bestowing it it also means to denote property or possession just like when Paul would say in First Corinthians 11 and 23 that I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered of you so Paul is saying to us that the Revelation that I have received that I delivered to you I got this from The Source the source is the Lord so I could not deliver these Revelations unless the Lord had delivered them to me these Revelations that I'm giving unto you they are of they're from The Source the property owner is the Lord notice what Jeremiah would say in Lamentations 3 and 22 that it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not you see the reason why there is a mercy is because it's of the Lord it doesn't matter what you're being in it doesn't matter what you go through it doesn't matter where you are if you receive Mercy you received it of the Lord the source of the Revelation is the Lord ain't that powerful ain't that powerful to know that you didn't get your power from yourself but you got it of the Lord ain't that wonderful to know that tonight that the revelations that you received you didn't get them from some man you got them of the Lord when you remember when Gideon's out there and he's out there hiding back there in his threshing wheat back there at a certain spot and he's hiding from the midianites that have come in there and there came an angel of the Lord and began to speak to him and tell him that you're a mighty man of our so he didn't Jared Gideon didn't even recognize that Valor was on the inside of him but there that angel had to tell him that you are a representative of Valor it didn't even recognize that that was there but this Revelation that the angel was given to get in was of the Lord there are certain things laying in your life that you don't know what you you don't know exactly what you're going to express in life you don't know exactly what you're going to be in life but because the Lord seen something in you that was of himself he allows you to be a representative of almighty God you remember when Gideon's out there and he's he's got his numbers and they're going against the midianite Army he's got 30 000 people there and God said there's too many for him and he goes down and he numbs them down he he comes down and he cuts out the cuts out the crowd he goes down to 12 000 people and then he comes down to 300 men because 12 000 men are setting up there and they're drinking water from the brook and what did they do what did they do they bent down and bowed their face they bowed their face before the water it proved what was on the inside of those men because they got down and they didn't look they didn't look at the Horizon but they had been worshipers of Baal and they were going down and they were sticking their face in the water and they were laughing at the water but those 300 men that was going to be with Gideon they had never bowed down to bail before him so they stood there they had their eyes on the horizon they looked down and got water in their hand and put it to their mouth this was a sign or a representation that they had been worshiping the true God you see it matters how you worship it matters how you worship you see if you're going to worship like kora's group you're going to go out there and worship a golden calf think you're worshiping God but if you're worshiping like Moses and Joshua you're going to worship the only true and living God but these men had been bowing down to Baal it showed it showed where they were from now notice notice what brother Branham said here in the thyroid Church age he said God looketh on the heart he said that has never changed ain't that powerful that has never changed and never will it change ain't you glad God didn't look at you the way you were before you got your change God looks on the heart that has never changed never will it change notice what the Bible said in second Timothy 2 and 19 that the Lord that searcheth the Reigns that word search means to track or to follow up he brother random said God tracks down our thoughts I Reigns at the search means to track down Reigns means our thoughts he knows what is in our heart he sees our works which are definitely a definite manifestation of what lies within us it is of the heart that precedes either righteousness or wickedness our motives our purpose are all known unto him as he watches every action now you remember what the angel said to brother Brandon he said that your thoughts are louder in heaven than your voice is here on Earth so it's a very powerful thing what's passing through your mind come on somebody so our motives ought to be on Christ Our objectives ought to be on Christ our conduct ought to always should and present Christ our language should spring we should speak of Christ our actions should prove Christ because we should always be thinking Upon Our Lord Jesus Christ because if we are representative of the one that hung on the cross we want to do it with everything that's within us you remember when William Branham comes and he preaches future home he takes the first portion of the first portion of future home and what does he do for the first 30 to 40 minutes he speaks about the character of the people at the meeting what is William random getting ready to break into of the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride he's telling us that there's going to be a character in a people that testifies here on Earth of what God has saw in the heavens come on somebody if this message ain't worth living here it ain't worth living there but if it's worth living there it's worth living here is that right but notice now that that's why I notice that's why Jesus spoke to Nicodemus and said you got to be born again you see when he was talking to Jesus about miracles and and the power that Jesus had here's Nicodemus he's got questions he's got Earnest questions some sincere questions he wasn't just coming to him because but he's got some real questions but Jesus didn't waste any time on Nicodemus he took him to the heart of the matter he said if you want to know how these Miracles and this power is done you've got to be born to my type of thinking you've got to be changed You Gotta Die to yourself Nicodemus here's this man here's this man and he's trying to learn of these Heavenly things but he can't learn of them because he's Earthly in his mindset Earthly in his nature you remember what the angel said you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things so what you're looking at is a people that are Pentecostal babies like a Nicodemus and couldn't go so far he still got to Jesus but it didn't go all the way Judas was in the circle but he didn't go all the way what was lack in Pentecost come on somebody what was offered to Nicodemus is offered to everyone sitting here tonight notice well the man said that this age that we're living in is reaching for something he said but they can't find it he said the hospitals are full of dissatisfied people the insane institutions are overrun dissatisfied he said they don't know what to do they seem to be something that they're reaching for but they never can come to it what is it what makes a man drinking smoke and do all those things it's because he's trying to satisfy you first that God put on the inside of him but you see what the devil has done he's presented a power or he's presented another way to quench his thirst but it never will quench his thirst now notice what William Branham says in enticing Spirits he said a man got demon-possessed one time stripped his clothes off he said they couldn't put clothes on him he said do you see what I mean it's enticing Spirits your church puts up with it your preachers are ready to say anything about it you won't pay or you won't pay your tithes anymore he said that's the reason he said that's the trouble he said my goodness how are you going to preach to a bunch of buzzards lest you get them converted right and be too with God to begin with they'll root their nose in dead stuff all the time what you need is a dumping out an old-fashioned Revival sweet from coast to coast to get men and women right with God he said let loose are the things of the world let loose of petty soft pedal preaching amen preach the gospel God said so he said if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God's not even easy even in you now notice he said people can jump up and down Shadow All Night Long speak in tongues like porn Peas on a dry cowhide walk right out the next morning with enough Timber to fight a bus haul go right on out and tell somebody in the church something and cause a whole church to be broke up it's nothing in the world but enticing demon spirits so we don't want some carnal impersonation here we want the real genuine holy ghost that was poured out on the day of Pentecost now William Bonham you know William Bradham preached three kinds of Believers and he said he said your present attitude shows what class you're in you just take the word test to them and you'll find out what kind of person that there is now I know there's a whole lot of people that are I'd rather a whole lot deal with unbelievers than to deal with make-believers because you know where he's stand with an unbeliever but with a make-believer they'll stab you in the back you never know what they're coming with but a real believer you can test them out put them on the word and they'll come out every single time saying the same thing that the word says well you see you've got to have a change in your nature you notice this age that we're living in it's the age of the people's rights and we're living in an age where it boasts of self-confidence people got more confidence in themselves than they do in God what are they they're lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God but our goal our goal is to rely only upon almighty God to loose ourself and rely on his life to rely on his power to lead to leave all of our nine reasonings alone come on somebody you know what William Branham said when he was preaching what it takes to overcome he said he said when you watch The Life go out of a tree he said it rots twice as fast and whenever the life of Jesus Christ leaves your home leaves her family leaves her prayer life you are rotting where you're sitting at Hallelujah but if you can get to where the life is at come on somebody if you can get down there you remember them old pump handles them all pump handles they used to sit out there on top of that whale head you had to pump them you had to Prime them a little bit so you had a little bit of water setting over here and you poured it down the pipe and you begin to Prime that thing what was it if you didn't have the water there you couldn't get no water out of the source but the word hallelujah the word is the source to get the watering of the word upon your soul and it might take a little priming it might take a preacher coming down there and preaching on the godhead preaching on this and preaching on that but all of a sudden it begins to bring up a spring up a whale of Life inside of your soul if you can get to where the life is you see it ain't about emotions it ain't about mental understanding it's about a change of nature a change of Duty you see our duty our duty is to empty out and die out but it's God's duty to impart his life on the inside of you the holy life that was inside of Jesus Zoe God's own life on the inside of you I'll tell you what you do when you have people when you have people that try to live a Christian Life when they try to live a Christian life and they can only get so far but brother random said that the new birth is far beyond good intentions the new birth Changes Everything About You it changes everything about you it changes your mind it changes your dress it changes everything about you that's the power of being born again but you see the road to hell is paved with good intentions I intended to go to church more I intended to pray more I intended to give my heart to the Lord but Jesus said except amen be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God he can't understand the very kingdom of God so you can have somebody try to tell you what the message is about and they don't get it it's because they don't have the understanding you ever looked at them pictures that that they got that you've got to look at them in a certain way you got to turn your head cross your eyes and Dot your t's and look in them things a player because there's a hidden image in there it always messes my eyes up to go looking at them things but if you can look at it with the right angle and you know how to do it you can see the hidden image in there and that's the reason why a lot of people can't understand the message is because they don't have the right looking glasses on they don't understand how to look at it but if you can only understand that what this message is is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever come on somebody it depends on where your birth from so that you can understand the very Kingdom of almighty God see some people and they're constantly trying to live a little bit higher and they constantly live a double life they're trying with everything that's within them to live this message but they can't go all the way it's because they haven't fully surrendered but you see what you do when you surrender your life to almighty God God can put his blessings upon your life you say well I don't think I'm very much and I don't think that God can do anything with me but do you still want brother Andrew I feel like I'm so low in sin and I can't get myself out of it don't you recognize that that's where real gold comes from and real Jewels come from it's when you got to go to digging down in the dirt to get them out of and you might be in a hell hole all kinds of sin but that's where we'll go comes from and Jesus is hunting out some real gold some people that'll stand the test of time you can take every medal and break it down but gold will stand there you can't burn it out you can put us through the trials of life you can put us through the Pains of life but gold stands out the hotter that it gets I'm not very much brother Andrew that's all right when you when God puts you in his hands God's got blessings on top of blessings I don't know if I can live this life yes you can you take that little bitty boy that had had five loaves of bread and two little fishes what did he do he surrendered them to Jesus you see in his hands he could barely feed himself but in the hands of almighty God he could feed five thousand and you may not be able to impress anybody but put your life on the hands of almighty God and God will make a serpent bruise her out of your life a real genuine Overcomer [Applause] God wants somebody that he can put the tutor over top of and said they're just like the father they act like you they dress like you they handle themselves like you and what it means to the father when he can send his son out to work over a field or work over situations to work over this sick person and work over this need and pray over them how much it impresses the father that he can have such confidence in pornependent upon his children that they're going to act in his name it's powerful thing it's a powerful thing when you can recognize that the father is behind you you see that's why William Branham said when he's talking about that Pillar of Fire that was taken down there if you in Houston he said he didn't come because of me he said he came because of the message of the Pentecostal message that I represent you see that Pillar of Fire that that world's in this room it's not here for me it's here for the message the message is Jesus Christ and when you begin to speak the message talk the message leave the message you may not have the understanding to be able to see like Elijah's been able to see but if you stick around to Hazel God will open up your eyes you might walk down in there in that Valley all afraid and see all the Assyrians around you but when Elijah speaks a word over you you'll be able to see like Elijah seen brother Branham said that gehaza couldn't see like Elijah could see was because the veil was upon him the veil was over him brother Byron said that that's what hinders each and every one of us is The Veil The Veil keeps us from the presence of God the veil keeps us it limits us this Veil right here limits us from where we're destined to live at but when Elijah spoke the words over gehaza said Lord open his eyes that he can see what was it William Branham said that the veil dropped off of gehaza's eyes and he could look out there on every Bush and could see all of them as Chariots of Fire With Angels there sitting there what was it brother Branham said in one spot that guy that Elijah didn't even see those angels sitting there he said but he simply knew that Psalms 34 had said that the angels of the Lord encamped about them that fear the lord he didn't even see them there but he knew because the scripture said they'd be there you may not see it here tonight but there's angels that are at their position the pillar Fires at its position the Holy Ghost is at its position Believers are at their position and if the veil can fall off of your eyes tonight you'd be amazed at what would happen here tonight if you can get rid of what happened this week well I did this I did that I worked so hard I'm just drained brother Andrew if you can lay the veil aside if you can lay aside your temperament for a minute if you can lay aside your ideas and come under the action of the inspiration of the Holy Ghost you'll see the message in plain view all right is that right you see if you're born again you got his thoughts if the mind of Christ is in you then you're a new creature you see a representative of Heaven they don't just change their outfits you can change your outfit for Sunday and change it back out for Monday but a representative of Heaven don't just change outfits they don't change their hair they don't change their war paint it's because they are a representative of Heaven they've got the ideas of almighty God they know what he wants done with the word they've gotten a confirmation of the commission he changed their heart and nothing is as powerful as a changed heart it's not about shouting shouting goes along with it it's not about dancing dancing goes along with it it's not about screaming to the top of your lungs that goes along with it but if you can sit there and scream and shout and and dance all over the place but you can't live what this message is outside of there I really don't want your shout and I really don't want your dance I really don't want your screaming if you don't have the power of the message to back up your sound find a message find the answer and the answer is Jesus come on somebody if I stood up here and preach with all of my mind and all of my power and I couldn't live it what good is it doing but if there's a life behind the power if there's a life behind the shout a life behind the dance a life behind it it'll produce the same thing right now come on somebody you don't impress me with your speaking in tongues if you can't live the message you don't impress me with your dance if you can't live the message but if there's a message to back up it every devil in hell can run against you and it'll never conquer you come on somebody God's looking for a representative that'll bless his name when it's good and when it's bad somebody that'll live it we've done seen every carnal impersonation that there can be but there's only one thing that there cannot be a carnal impersonation and that's his third pull and when this third pool is in action let me tell you you'll know the real thing when it settles upon your heart it's the king's sword come on somebody you have to worry what the seals are you are the Seals you don't have to worry what the shout is you are the shout this message is you well you better be careful brother Andrew you're stretching out there let me tell you you can't talk about God without talking about me that's what they said Michael Jordan Dwyane Wade said they said you can't talk about basketball without mentioning my name let me tell you you can't talk about God in this hour without mentioning my name you can't talk about this you can't talk about this message without representing how all the Full Gospel Lighthouse because I'm a part of this last stage come on Abraham one of these days you're going to wake up and the change is going to be over you you can sit there and think well I'm never no good it's just a flesh you're not born of the flesh you're born of the spirit of almighty God well Dwyane Wade made it into the sermon [Music] what is it it's a people that looks so close it's Jesus again that's Jesus again that's Jesus getting written you know now let me let me just come right here for a moment there's a reason why they thought William Branham was God come on now there's a reason why they thought William Brandon was God he humbled himself like almighty God he and boasts if anybody had rights to boasts and talk about how powerful they were William Branham could have done it but this man looked so much like Jesus that the world thought it was him I would that somebody would think that you're Jesus he would testify about how much life you got how much power you got how much inspiration you got well I seen Jesus and brother Chris I seen Jesus and brother Joel I seen Jesus it's a testimony come on somebody if you humble yourself under the message [Applause] well we got to have all these activities to keep our young people no we don't come on I didn't told all these young people what we exercise on the weekend at our youth events that's just a bonus without what happens here that don't happen out there we don't need basketball games to keep our young people we don't need volleyball games we don't need agendas just preach a message come on somebody I ain't gonna play you the Super Bowl to get you here on Sunday I didn't got to play you some new Hollywood movie to get you here all I gotta do is preach the message that's why Satan hates you it's because you don't need entertainment Your Entertainment is Jesus [Applause] let Hollywood entertain themselves but let the bride entertain herself with Jesus Hallelujah [Applause] foreign that the message works their sister setting all over this building that was written off by the rest of Christendom and I'll be honest there's a lot of you sitting here that were written off by message preachers today well I'm going to preach it anyway there's a whole lot of people that would have cast you out would have never received you never received your ties would have said that you're not welcome here your kind's not welcome here but because you had representation by predestination Hallelujah there's a lot of people that cast you out kicked you out and said you wasn't a part of it but God had something inside of you before the foundation of the world so before Satan could count me out God had already counted me in some of them said they'd never leave a message they said they never lived a message our our pastor stood right here when we had cheerleaders we had people that were strung out on dope had girls come in here that look like the world never one time preached a closed line religion well brother Angel I can give you a quote on that if you don't preach clothesline religion you're not quoting the gospel let me tell you live the gospel live the gospel I got very little confidence in a man that can stand up and preach a message as hard as he can but he can't live it but I can put confidence in somebody that can stand there and say let's be Jesus to them left right let's represent heaven to them then they might be of heaven you know he said well that's strong preaching brother Andrew you're right it is that's all right I can take the heat of them preachers I want to get on my back I never preached to Stephanie Breeden I never preached to Melissa Hill I never preached to Crystal Huffman how to message was shown out to them and they became a part of it you look at brother Murphy Wong what a powerful testimony that he is when he first come to the message his wife was an unbeliever you know where they came from they came from a communism China had all kinds I had all kinds of things upon them but when brother Murphy came to the message he was so afraid of what sister Tracy would think about the message so he didn't say nothing to her so she just come in and sat down beside him now granted sister Tracy doesn't understand one lick of English at the time but she's sitting there don't understand English and the preacher's just preaching away and she don't understand anything Murphy's not in interpreting anything all of a sudden Tracy gets up says Tracy gets up walks out to the back and he's like man she's mad about this now she don't even understand what's being preached she's mad and all of a sudden she comes back in she takes her earrings out she begins to clean she didn't even understand English but the word the presence of the Living God washed the sister there are people in Africa that are sitting here under the message today didn't know one thing about it because the language barrier there but by the preaching of the word they were sitting there innate they were completely naked and when the presence of the Lord came they went and dressed themselves come on somebody you get born again I ain't got to tell you how long you got to have your dress I ain't got to tell you how long yet I keep your hair you just get burned again you just get good and born again and it'll live right out of you well how Short's Too Short Jesus will tell you it's my hair long enough I don't really care as long as it ain't cut oh you're gonna make somebody mad I'm sure glad I can do it see that sister she ain't got very long hair she ain't living out the message do you know that there's some people they can't even grow out their hair it ain't about if it's long or not it's if it's uncut or not and if you get off of your high horse get knocked down like Paul wood you'd let me do the preaching and let the message do what it's supposed to do [Applause] oh I can feel that one burning well probably gonna get more emails than ever have my phone number ain't even on the on the Church website but I'm sure somebody's gonna find it this week don't count them out don't you count them out God had enough Grace to get you isn't it amazing ain't it amazing you can be so judgmental to somebody else but when you fall do you extend the same Grace or do you extend the same judgment now I'm just preaching and I'll tell you this I didn't learn too long I've been doing this for too long not to listen to Papa God when he begins to talk ain't no issue here I'm just preaching what he said preach but if you are up on your high horse I'll help you get down [Applause] well well I love y'all remember I'm saying what was the Holy Ghost given for and I'm coming to a close because we're having too much fun up here but he said you take a person that's lived a good life and they're always defeated he said oh I'll tell you a good person oh I sure love the Lord Brother Branham but they're always defeated they never get a prayer answered he said you feel that little woman with the Holy Ghost one time and you watch what takes place when she goes before God she's not defeated she comes boldly to the throne of God believing she has a right because she's a daughter of God by birth take that little man that's so cowardly the Boss Kick him all over the place said wait a minute here now something changed he's got the Holy Ghost he gives you power your life is full of power your life is fully he gives you power to speak he gives you power to live right Hallelujah you see this kind of people know what he wants done with the word now this scripture I'm getting ready to read it can either condemn you or it can lift you up it just depends on where you're living at because the Bible says here in James 1 and 21 that wherefore lay upon all filthiness and superfluity which means abundance of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word or the implanted by nature which is able to save your souls but be you doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own self for if any be a hero of the word and not a doer he is likened to a man beholding his natural face in the glass for he behold of himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetth what manner of man he was so it's like a person sitting here the message for 30 years but live a defeated life or it's like this but whosoever looketh in the perfect law of Liberty and continuous therein he being not a forgetful hearing but to do her the work this man shall be blessed how many likes to be blessed this man the consider the message take it when it's hot and take it when it's not that man is blessed in his deed so a person that refuses to be corrupted with the world's value that man can be blessed notice what Psalms 19 and 8 says about it that the statues of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart the Commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the lies the fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true righteous all together more to be desired than day of gold yea than much fine gold sweeter than also the honey and the honeycomb moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping them there is great reward this man is blessed in his deed Psalm 65 and 4 said blessed is the man whom thou chooses and calls us to approach Unity the reason why you can have the approach that you have is because you're chosen by almighty God now I'm a Believer I'm a Believer in God's word in the people that when it fills their life that it gives them the very dynamics of the mechanics because we recognize that the scripture tells us that the letter kills but the spirit gives life and I'm not making room for people's mistakes but I'm giving them room to get to a place of repentance I'm a believer I'm a Believer in you when the word is in there because you are not just standing on your own two feet you are representing all of heaven when the Dynamics of the message come in there that's what William Branham said would be that the restoration of the hour would be a refilling of the Holy Ghost the Dynamics of the message Hallelujah and when you put that on the inside of these bottles sitting here what does it do it produces the same thing that happened up there on the day of Pentecost when 120 so-called Scout cowards appear 10 days before now they come out boasting and speaking in tongues bow in the power of the Holy Ghost I'm a Believer in the word in God's people you may not look like the best quality material but you just let the word wash you you let the word wash you you see that's why God gives you a pastor foreign because people are like an onion they come off layer to layer and they make you cry God don't give you an evangelist that comes through and storm through your life to be the harbor over your soul he gives you a pastor when you get down here he'll be right there lifts you up he reminds you that a righteous man can fall but he gets back up seven times he reminds you that there's a message and there is a blood that there is able to cover you from all of your sins thank God that God's got God given pastors you see because you may not look it exactly like the photograph that God took before the foundation of the world but you're going to get there Seth there was a lot of times in your life that it didn't look like it was going to be very promising that you did like the photograph that God took and it looked like maybe maybe about you brother Joel it just looked like it man that dude is not it's just not going to get it it's just not gonna it's just not gonna get but the word began to wash over and to begin to clean off your life and that's why God speaks in Ezekiel he said I will clean you with pure water and I will put my spirit in this inside of you I'll give you a new heart and a new spirit and then I'll give you my spirit you see you see there is where a lot of people they miss the message but that's the message right there get a new heart get a new spirit so you can get along with his Spirit when it comes brother Randall said it's like a mainspring of a watch everything if that mainspring is off if that new spirit is off you'll never live the message but you get that mainspring working in action it'll be it'll prove Acts 2 and 4. it'll prove John 3 16. it'll proved Hebrews 13 and 8. when the mainspring is there that's why Jesus would say in Matthew 9 and 17 that you can't put new wine in Old bottles why is that it's because that new skin has got to be flexible that's why you got to be born again you can't handle the message in your old dead state you watch a lot of people not accepting that I'll do whatever I want to well you see your cowhide you're just dead and dried up I ain't gonna listen to that old Pastor preach the way he's preaching well you're proving your old dead cow hide right there but oh when the pastor gets a preacher and he'd go all that new wine gets you stimulated on the inside of you because you got a new skin you begin to get flexible to the word it's got life in it you see that wine that Revelations got life in it and he's got to have room to move but you put that all right that new wine on the inside of old cranky old woman old man they've been born again why it's too cold he's too loud he's not speaking loud enough I'll tell you what if it's so hot out there I'm not coming to church I've been I've been just thinking about all how how I could get dehydrated if I walk outside for 10 minutes you know he's going to preach it oh he's pretty gonna burn my head you old cow hot you know every once in a while but be careful every once in a while it feels good to get a good woman it reminds you you're still human because if you think you got it all figured out get ready you coming down but if you can handle the true word the way it's preached like the prophet preached it it shows that there's a new sin that can handle a new why and don't you thankful you've been born again filled with the Holy Ghost and that there has been a covenant that is made don't touch a new wine don't touch the oil Satan can't touch the Holy Ghost and he can't touch this revelation the message works the message works would you stand with us this evening you see in the world in a world when Nimrod was building a tower and it looked like men were turning their back on God God had a man by the name of Enoch that was going to type out of people for rapture in a world in a world that was that was debauched in sin that God repented that he created man God had a Noah on the earth that was going to float above the Judgment Waters when when there was a whole bunch of of God denying people that was living in Babylon God had three Brew here children when the when men when a king made a decree when our King made a decree that there would be no prayer made for such and such time God had a man that was loyal that would pray and knew that when he got himself into situations prayer had the ability to get him out God had a man by the name of Daniel in the midst of a Babylonian Kingdom when there was an age of philosophers and theologians God had Men by the name of Peter James and John faith hope and charity that he could prove that Jesus was still Jesus what is it you're here to represent the boss you're here to represent the laws and if I can't represent him and all that he is if I can't represent him in my speech I say Lord clean me up if I can't represent him the way the message says I should Lord clean me up [Music] Lord if I'm not presenting the message in the right light or clean me up I don't want anything to hinder me [Music] you said brother Andrew you a preacher absolutely I'm not just accountable for me I'm accountable for every one of you you really you realize how how dangerous a thing that this is I don't take this lightly so I go before God and I present myself I make sure that the blood's over my life and I say God what would you speak to your children tell them they're representing me and when they walk out of there and lay ought to see ya the world may seem like they're not watching but they're watching I want to represent him in my character and my power my language [Music] you know what I got confidence in a man I got confidence in a man that don't say a whole lot but he can live what the message is more than somebody that can boast about the quotes and boast about the scriptures you can't live it I say oh God live in me like never before fill me up whether it's on a job whether it's on whether it's a school whether it's at work or where wherever I Am Lord let me represent you to the fullest [Music] if if I'm going to display his power of healing and his power of giving out the Holy Ghost I've got to represent him in a real Sanctified holy life well brother Andrew I'm hot one moment and I'm cold the next have you been born again thank you it's a real key to every question that you got I felt him today and I didn't feel him there's going to be moments like that but whatever you do whatever you say don't do anything anything unless you're comfortable with Jesus sitting right beside you I tell you you'll think about things different when the prince of peace and the King of Kings and the Lord of lords that's why David would say that I have set the Lord before me in all my ways that I might not sin against him because you can't sin when you're looking at the Lord so God if I'm going to represent your kingdom and I'm going to represent your power let there be a overflow in my life clean me up give me a new spirit give me a new heart got it I don't just bust out and when preaching of the word gets a little hard and correction comes down I don't want to prove I'm a bastard I want to prove I'm a son I want to be able to stand it Lord I want to be able to handle it I tell you what your children will love you more because you saved them from getting ran over by a car then you're just letting them stay out there and let them do it don't you love it when the Lord says you've had to get run over I'm up here it's all about that for who's this for brother Andrew [Music]
