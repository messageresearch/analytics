me how great is our god hello see how great how great is our god hallelujah we can certainly say amen to that kin when we think of great we look at it quite different than the rest of the world would think of great because we know that greatness is expressed in humility god is so great that he could condense into such a place that mortals can comprehend it without a new birth because he's so big and they think great and great is how big and how gigantic his hands are and his eyes must be really really big and his hair really really big but when he comes to the earth a baby greatness is expressed in humility that's why the way up is down human beings can't relate to that without a new birth themself starting out if you would to the song of solomon chapter six verse eight what a privilege it is for us to be together here tonight such an honor for me to be able to be here with the saints you and the church and brother ron fraser be preaching with brother tim and all the other ministers that were here i told brother ron yesterday i felt like a water boy among five star generals so i don't say that to be humble either i say it because that's why i i look at it i think it's it's an honor some of the greatest men of god that live in this day call me their friend i count that's such a privilege i can remember whenever i was a little boy out on the playground at school wanting a friend whenever i growed up and got a little bit older and gave my heart to the lord and the boys at school tormented me and hated me and they'd bring pornographic magazines to school and they'd try to make me look at them and i'd close my eyes and they'd hold me down and take their fingers and open my eyes and hold them pictures in front of me and i was tormented never didn't have very many friends so i've got friends all the world today [Music] i'm so grateful for that now maybe you've had friends all your life and people's always loved you then you wouldn't be able to appreciate that but i appreciate friends i appreciate your friends but tim was speaking to us last night and lord didn't do a great job tremendous job at the end of his thoughts he was pulling together who this is that is among us as far as isaac coming out to meet rebecca in the field so who is he that was among us tonight i'd like to speak to you on who is she who is she son of solomon chapter six verse eight there are therefore there are there three score queens and four score concubines and virgins was outnumbered my dove my undefiled is but one she is the only one of her mother she is the choice of her that bear her the daughters saw her and blessed her yea the queens and the concubines and they praised her now listen to this next verse who is she who is she that looketh forth as the morning fair as the moon clear as the sun terrible as an army with banners now listen it's a question who is she believe it or not this is a great crest question in the world of christendom today who is the bride is there a difference between the bride and the church are they all the same is there any difference who is she which one is she how do you get in to be a part of her who is she that look us for us as the morning fairs the moon clear as the sun terrible as an army with banners let's bury us together lord jesus we are so grateful tonight father that we can be gathered together here in this place with your children we counted a privilege to be with one another but more importantly than that we counted such an honor to be with you into this place that the supernatural of god has been so many many times over the years but yet we're asking once again that you would come among us lord that you would help us if you're here there's nothing we can face lord that will not be able to crest ever wave and make it through every trial so lord i'm asking you that you would help me would you come and use that part of yourself that you placed in my life called a gift i've studied i've prayed i've sought your mind and i pray that you would help me now that i can get out of the way but lord even if you used me and come and anointed that what good would it do if you don't use them to listen and to hear so would you anoint them and speak through me and may there be a cycle of the holy ghost that will be so formed here tonight lord you know the needs of your people and i'm sure there are many as we've gathered here but we know our god is greater than all of our needs speak to us tonight from your word father in jesus name we pray amen god bless you saints you may be seated i'd like to read to you from the ephesian church aids 80. the true church of jesus christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes or his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her and the saint said there is no fault in her now this is not humanly we know this is not us looking at ourselves this is not looking at one another but this is the way divinely that he looks at his elect she is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of her lord and all his works are perfect now listen carefully with this in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god in her listen this again in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by face for god hath spoken do you believe that so who is she now if god had something in his mind that he wanted to declare a people that would be like him and we know that in the beginning he was the eternal he wasn't even god which is an object of worship brother man tells us in several places he said the first thing that i think that he made was angels then they began to worship him and he became god because god is an object of worship but before that he was the eternal but he had attributes in him that he desired to express but what if you were the eternal and you couldn't go any higher you couldn't go any wider you couldn't go any broader and there's only one way for you to expand yourself and that was the way of condensation god couldn't go any higher he couldn't go any broader there was no more wisdom there was no more intelligence higher than him but there was only one door that he left by which he would be able to expand himself and that was through condensation this is why i say greatness is expressed through god condensating himself which is the way a true christian finds a full expression of god in their own lives you see a a church or a preacher or an individual and they're all the time stepping on other people to make themselves higher you're going the exact opposite way of true christianity that's not the way the lord god done he did not step on anybody to give up he laid aside everything to come down and then go up and take us a prison now i want you to notice you know how that whenever the the king begins to describe the attributes of the bride are written in the song of solomon of course they hid in symbolic form but he says about her in verse 10 who is she that looketh forth as the morning now he likens the bride to the the breaking of the day now he does not liken her initially in the initial stages of her walk with him as she is the full strength of the sun or the moon shining in the new day or the illumination of the fullness of life but he says that she is as the morning so he likens her to the breaking of the morning all of those of you who have been up whenever the day begins to dawn it is the fading away of the night time and changing of dispensation from the night to the day and you have a hard time differentiating between the light and the darkness the day and the night why because the sun as we say is beginning to rise over the horizon it's beginning to break and many times as you look over they'll rise and you'll see it's it's turning real real red and the sun begins to peep up over it and there's still light and there's still darkness so he says that the bride is like the breaking of the morning that's the way it is with a person when they first get saved when they first come to god there's still mist around them all kinds of darkness all kinds of tradition that we're holding on to why because the morning is just beginning to break so it's as the morning you brothers are sitting a tree stand and you're you're hunting and you're waiting and the stillness of the darkness and you get in there and you wait and you wait and you begin to see the first breaking of the daylight the sun's not even up yet and yet you don't even see the sun but there's enough that's preluding what the sun is going to do and the light begins to break but you know what the darkness is still there but yet the light and the darkness are fighting and they're going back and forth because the dawn is beginning to break now he says who is she that looketh forth as the morning now this is her dawn this is when she begins to break forth but it is not in a strength it is not a light that can quick and see yet it is not a light that actually can begin to warm the earth it is the breaking force of light as our souls are born into the very presence of god our souls begin to begin to illuminate by ray after rey after ray of light god deals with us in a very slow progressive manner this is why that god continued to choose through four deaths messengers it would take it down to four life messengers the restoration would come back in the end time and that's why there's never been a light shining so bright as what you are in this hour now people can do whatever they want to do and say whatever they want to say and they can try to butcher our message and try to discredit it all they want to but we're walking on in the light and this word is going to change our bodies exactly right now the words these words describe the the progressive reflection of light as it breaks force in the dawn of the morning as the aurora or as these this venus as she begins to stand there in the night skies and she's eliminating it and notice it is the rise of the truth that becomes burst in the soul that's borne by the breath of god it's the same way so it begins to come forth i want you to notice in proverbs chapter 4 verse 18 it says the path of the just is as the shining light that shine us more and more unto the perfect day aren't you glad that god deals with us in this progressive manner it was justification that made way for sanctification and sanctification made way for the baptism of the holy ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost made way for the holy ghost himself to be able to come what was it more and more light unto the perfect day my friends we are now in that time and of course the word perfect it's not sinlessness but it is a sign of maturity it is under that perfect light of malachi 4 that the bride of jesus christ will shine forth and illuminate so much that it will force our bodies to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye hallelujah hallelujah notice in judges chapter 5 verse 31 so let all thine enemies perish o lord let them that love him be as the son when he goeth forth in his might now notice the church then is compared initially to the morning as it begins to break forth but as she grows in the progression of the word of god and the revelation of the light of the day she comes from the daytime whenever the night is still pressing and it's all pushing against her until she eventually begins to sign so in the light of god that she's likened unto the son himself so he said let all thine enemies perish o lord but let them that love him be as the son when he goeth forth in his might notice isaiah chapter 58 verse 8 then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine health shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before thee and the glory of the lord shall be thy reward notice how god has been dealing down to 2 000 years of church ages as the brilliance of the light would have come and if god had not orchestrated it in the perimeter of the boundaries of his word the first church would have took a rapture because they had enough original faith in the original word they could have took a rapture but god ordained that there would be seven church ages so he had to allow that seed to go down into the ground what was that see it was an alpha bride but what is the omega bright it is the same strength of that same word but we're not ordained to be buried we are ordained to rise we're not ordained hallelujah say go down into the ground but we are ordained of god for the combine not the plow we're not placed in the pile we're not facing the disc we are facing the combine that's going to pull us into the elevator of god oh what a glorious hour to be living in notice how he reveals the bride we know that the bride being married to the groom she must have multi aspects of her personage as he does you know the lord god has many aspects of his personage in the way that he reveals himself and he has a bride he's created abroad that is a multi-aspect individual and she has in her person it's many different things which are the traits of his own characteristics and she could only be this way by the act of the divine creator we know notice how he likens her here and again song of solomon chapter 6 verse 10 who is she that looketh forth as the morning fair as the moon now he brings her from the breaking of the day and he brings her over to being likened unto the moon so she it's not only light the morning when the night and the day are beginning to to intermingle and the light is breaking forth but now he moves over and says that she is like the moon now notice this in genesis chapter 1 verse 15 when god was actually placing the lights on the sky and he said let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it will so and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night and he made the stars also and god didn't set them in the firmament of the heaven now the hebrew word you're fulfirmed is an expanse so god made an expanse and god placed this now this of course being the active original creation of god this is during the geological ages millions and millions of years ago no doubt but god began to place them there and when no one ever god began to move upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god said let there be light this was not a creative act that god was doing but god was actually drying off the atmospheres brother tim preached about last night the seeds were laying on the earth from some former civilization right so what he said in the fourth seal they were laying here but god now speak and said let there be light not another created that by which he's creating the sun or the moon they were already brought into existence but now the atmosphere needed to be changed in order for the power of the sun to activate the seas that were laying on the earth you know what god was doing god was giving the earth a new verse that was your type amen it was a type of a human being an individual that would be born by the spirit of god you had a seed in you from a former civilization you did not live as a man or woman but you were in the mind of god and god said in your age let there be light and there was light where was that light it come from the word of god and shine on your soul [Applause] verse 18 says to rule over the day and rule over the night and divide to divide to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good brother says it this way the moon and the sun is husband and wife and while the sun is gone away it throws its light against the moon to give us a smaller light until the sun comes when the sun comes the moon fades out the church is the light of the world until jesus comes and then it melts all together like the moon night and the sunlight becomes one light together when christ and his church comes together at the great millennium they emerge into one now who is she though who is she how do you get injured he's just going oh you put your name on the book somewhere who is she she is the elect of god she is not our choice i choose to be bro you don't choose to be bright he chose us before the foundation of the world and there ain't enough devils in hell there ain't enough laws and congress president our senate nobody else will ever change that it is god's orchestration not ours [Applause] but friends i realize a lot of folks look at predestination as only a doctrine i look at it as an attribute of my daddy [Applause] predestination is not just a doctrine to me it's one of my father's attributes [Applause] watch this again brother ram tells us in hebrews the moon is the shadow of the sun and the sun just reflects its light when it's behind the earth and the moon gives light to walk by night now this is what you and i are in the evil age we're living why is it then that sin is still so predominant because we are moonlight not sunlight now we look out here in the dam whenever the sun comes out it makes no difference how much darkness is sharing there and there the sun is the king of light so it expels all the darkness yet whenever you and i are shining in this day look at all the sin look at all the darkness it's worse now that it's ever appeared we are here to rule the night not change tonight we will not change it they'll go right on passing walls contrary to god's word they will press against us but we are still ruling the night you say how can you say that because i know the word is right [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] notice he said christ represents the son and the church represents the moon the husband and wife in the absence of christ the church reflects the minor light it's light to walk in until the sunlight will appear the moon is part of the sun and the church said and y'all ever seen any picture of those rocks that they brought from the moon i'm not sure what you thought they'd look like but for me i kind of thought to be a luminescent maybe and it shine a little bit but it looked just like a rock out of virginia looked just like a rock out of tennessee or louisiana because it has no illumination on its own it's just like a piece of dirt just like a piece of dirt like me and like you makes the glory of god around this bride we look just like any other hillbilly out of virginia tennessee it's not us it's the light of the sound that shines on our souls that's what makes us above other people not us within ourselves [Applause] i love this and question answer 64. i hope this don't stumble you brother man said this person that's in you it's your birth you're john doe you were born into certain months under a certain star and that has something to do with you certainly it does that's your best pass right it's your birth path now he says i know papa used to say you can't plant them potatoes at this time because the moon isn't right you can't plant them potatoes billy and i'm said i'm not planting them in the moon i'm planting them in the ground now he said go ahead smart alec but it's helping you get a few bumps on your heads you learn something you take a board and lay it down out there in the grass in the dark of the moon and watch what happens the grass will die right now but lay it in the light of the moon and let it lay there for a week and it won't hurt it now how can this be considering that the sun or the moon rather averages 238 thousand 555 miles away from the earth that's just on average sometimes more sometimes less so according to the way the moon is 200 and almost 40 000 miles from the earth if you lay aboard at a certain time it'll change it now explain that to me will you you have 10 minutes you can't but we believe it and accept it right hello watch brother baby says you watch the sea when the moon changes when the moon goes out the tide follows it out and it's oh my millions of miles from the earth you go down in the state of kentucky and sink a rod on that drilling now for all till you hit salt water and watch that pipe how deep it is in the moon and when the tide's in watch it go out you plant something that spreads on the top of the earth and the dark of the moon and watch it go right down like a radish or a turnip you plant it back on there and watch it spread on top of the earth what's it got to do with the moon she has invisible ordinances and laws [Applause] get her by god not because she's brilliant not because she's awareness she's god's spoken word praise the lord hallelujah psalms 104 verse 19 he appointed the moon for seasons he appointed the moon for seasons i thought the seasons were on the earth but the heavenly objects that god ordained and orchestrated around the laws of the earth actually what dictate her seasons and cycles upon the earth so we have a heavenly counterpart which influences what goes on on this earth every day of our life you ever wonder why they call people lunatics i'm not saying that to be funny now you know where that word comes from lunar moon you ever wonder why that births are timed with the new moons you ever look at the moon signs in the body and certain surgeries and certain things that take place in your body now y'all think i'm an astrologist now watch this is what god said he appointed the moon for season so the moon is set there to divide times the moon is con earth and her influence thousands and hundreds of thousands of miles away yet she affects the cycles on the earth let me tell you something for him wars and all these different things that have come down to the ages the church ages did not follow the wars the wars followed the church one of these days you're going to realize if you don't already it's not been the world out here in the bride and the church kind of following around as a follow behind oh no lack of god by which seasons are appointed not the [Applause] hallelujah this world needs me this crazy world needs you don't take that but why do we leave it'll really fall apart [Applause] hallelujah so he appointed the moon for seasons now how is it then that god whenever he placed the earth and he knew that man would fall now we know this is in the universe that actually fell when man fell so there's millions and millions of other planets oh my they're keep expanding and going on and on and on with all that they're finding in the universe with the hubble telescope and there are millions and millions of worlds and well they looked at it back in the 50s and 60s and they're looking out through there and thinking they they've thought that saw the very end of the universe 120 million years of life space and now they've gone way beyond that the prophet said that's only a sixteenth of an inch in eternity and they're looking out to see but yet there's only one planet that fell when adam fell the universe is exactly the way it was when god created it in the beginning why did this planet only fall because here was where god put his son and everything under the dominion of that son fell but mars was not under his dominion or jupiter under his dominion or the sun or the moon on the earth and this book right here my friends this book right here mentions what point it by name earth earth's name is written in the book of life that's why god cannot destroy the earth he must redeem the earth hallelujah find mars in your bible find jupiter in your bible some astronaut long ago said you think your life on other planets i said well i really don't know there could be but one thing i do know when it's all said and done we get the king [Applause] he chose to make his home here not only that he chose to take his own human body out of here and he chose to take your body out of here hallelujah the foundation of the divisions of the year what we call months is synchronized with the cycles of the moon israel would have their beginning of their months and it would begin with new moons so the moon synchronized the ages the times the breaking of events oh hallelujah notice jeremiah 31 35 thus saith the lord which giveth the sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon the ordinances of the moon you all know any of them you see this is only deity architect speaking here we know he's got them but we don't know exactly what they are so there's ordinances you know like a city ordinance when you go through a city and you say and i have according to an ordinance so and so and so you cannot use a break on your truck and you can't go over some out and you can't touch your horn and you can't do that what is that that is a city ordinance according to elton virginia so that you come through there and they catch you doing that ah yes what they're going to give you a ticket well god designed and set aside ordinances to the moon and here we are living down on the earth and we know that there but we really have no idea and we're just living by day by day by day under the influence and they say oh what in the world would the moon what difference would it make if the moon wasn't there the earth would stand upside down should spin like this should spin like that because the moon is what keeps the earth from tilting in a wild bizarre rotation do you understand what's keeping this world from not being any worse than it is it is the bride it is she who is she who is she that has such power that satan cannot take over till she's gone now let me give you a little bit of science the ocean on the side of the earth facing the moon gets pulled toward the moon more than it does the center of the planet now the gravitational pull in the earth is what keeps the water on it i'm sure you've seen pictures of the earth made by nasa and hubble and all that and whenever you stand and look at it here's the earth and this great beautiful circle like this and here's africa down here in india over there and you think how are they on the bottom of that ball and yet they're standing upright how are they standing there not falling off and then when you shift around and you go around like this and then you're down on the bottom and you think well which way is up are you up are they up are they down are you how in the world now we could understand it if it was out there like a flat surface but it's a ball hallelujah and our lord god knew that man would fall and he made the earth with enough grace that he knew when the earth was standing like this in the beginning and when man would fall the earth would tilt over on its axis 23 and a half degrees there was enough grace from standing upside like this when it tilted over on 23 and a half degrees that it would not fall or explode or bust apart hallelujah the grace of god already knew it before man was ever made he knew the earth needed an element of grace who is she it's his counterpart now watch this i find this amazing the ocean on the side of the earth facing the moon gets pulled toward the moon than it does the center of the planet yet gravity is what holds the ocean now remember the arctic and the antarctic and yet it's on the bottom of the ball why don't it all just fall off when you go home get you a ball when you kiss balls baseball basketball soccer ball whatever put water on it and see if you can make it hold most of you ain't gonna try because you know what the answer is but how does this ball hang out down the universe with all these billions and billions of gallons of water hanging upside down and they don't fall off if we could hear the atlantic and the pacific and the indian and the antarctic and all these oceans we'd hear them singing i feel the pool what holds them to the earth gravitation the law of god it's invisible and yet they don't have a brain they don't have a free moral agency they don't have a choice and yet they hug right there to the earth hallelujah but god made enough give in the ocean that when the moon moves around at a certain cycle and the oceans begin to face the moon the pool on the from the moon begins to pull the water what is it the tides rising if god can move on a dumb bunch of water what will the holy ghost do when it moves on a predestinated city hallelujah brother brady that water can't say no that water can't say ouch the water can't say i'll help you lord but it's a pool beyond itself it's something that's pulling the water the water can't read the law the water can't read the ordinance about the moon but it's simply being pulled oh hallelujah i'll tell you one thing devil do what you're gonna do but she ain't gonna stop this bride she's ordained of god to stand for this word and there is nothing that will stop her she is an invincible army that's who she is and the moon's out there she makes no great noises has no light on her of her own her atmosphere is so thin the extremity of her temperatures are 400 degrees difference in a day's time her atmosphere around her is so thin that a footprint on the moon can be there for hundreds of years because there's no storms there to touch here the ocean on the side of the earth facing the moon gets pulled toward the moon more than the center of the planet this creates a high tide on the other side of the earth another high tide occurs because the center of the earth is being pulled toward the moon more than the ocean on the other side so here you've got the water on this side being pulled by the moon and the water on the other side nearly 25 000 miles around on the other side and it's been pulled by the moon too and it don't know what to do except just follow the pool so up and down the coast of south carolina georgia north carolina up in new brunswick and wherever more than it is it just begins to go in and out and what does it do it's done it for millennia i said it's done it for millennia in and out why the ordinance of the moon is controlling it oh hallelujah brother sister let me tell you there's come at a time and i don't think it's going to be long when god's going to take the moon out of this world and the effects of the moon on this world we're the only thing that's keeping it from going totally insane right now [Applause] oh hallelujah perhaps the most important effect of the moon scientists say is the way it stabilizes the rotation of the earth when the earth rotates it wobbles back and forth on its axis like a top which simply doesn't stand in a vertical position now if you've got a top and when your children's top and you sit down you sit there and pump it and it says right on it's in it's made to pivot on one end but remember that earth had to fall can't you see why the earth's growing it's wanting to get back up again hallelujah the earth in the original creation was not made to tilt over like this that's the way it is with you if you're out of fellowship with god and you're 23 and a half degrees or 45 degrees or 109 degrees out of fellowship you wouldn't make the wobble like that you wasn't made to be drinking and running around and smoking and acting like the devil oh no you were made to stand upright as a son or daughter of god and rotating the perfect obedience to the word think of our lives what we were before god put us in contact with the ministry of the moon hallelujah look a lot of these people that are pulling away from the message and look at what's happened to them they're topsy-turvy they're wobbling they don't know what way's up which way is there thank god for a good holy ghost ministry and a good holy ghost church amen why would we be without it oh hallelujah so you imagine she's and tilted half degrees so the north pole in the south pole on her axis she's spinning but she isn't spinning it perfect so she wobbles every now and then so god put the moon out there and said now you watch her when she goes to wobbling real bad exert some of your power on her so the earth goes to wobbling and wobbling and the moon through an invisible union through the spoken word the gravitation begins to pulsate from the moon and it straightens donny out i mean the earth out don't stop don't look at me like you don't need no straightening it out every now and then every one of us whether or preachers or deacons or whatever we are we get to wobbling around in life a little bit and we go to getting kind of crooked turning around oh my and what does god do he'll lay some sermon on some man of god's heart oh it'll come and baron our high what's it doing is straighten us back up or we can rotate around the world where we can rotate around god's word can't you see why satan hates god calling it satan loves this bunch of modern day compromising jelly backbone preachers [Applause] do whatever you want to do we don't want to make nobody mad jellyfish [Applause] i was wobbling enough before i got saved i'd certainly like to calm down some of my wobbling after i've become a christian with you when the earth rotates it wobbles slightly back and forth now you imagine here you are out in the middle of the universe on this great globe and we're spinning around now friends how is it that we're spinning around as fast as we are and none of y'all ain't sick everyone think about it it's mind-boggling [Music] we can't even tell we're moving you see in the days of christopher columbus they thought it was flat but he looked out through yonder and he saw something different he could see the top of the mast of the ship before he'd see the ship and he said it can't be flat because if it's flat i should be able to see it all the same so it let him know there was a curvature to the earth he had no scriptures to go by he had no prophets quotes to go by but he had something driving him to say there's a new world there's a new world i know there's got to be people said you're going to fall off the end of the earth you're going to go crazy there ain't no way in the world i believe god ordained that men to do what he did amen i needed to live in tennessee you needed to live in virginia or louisiana wherever you're from god had some attributes amen he wanted to express over here and he had to bring elijah from this continent on the earth so there had to be a man of vision that would break beyond the skeptics oh i'm so glad god sent us another one in this day it's like a top which doesn't spin in a vertical position on a table or floor but without the moon would be wobbling much more with no moon as a stabilizer the earth would sometimes tilt all the way back here she is 240 000 miles away and what keeps this earth from turning upside down is the ordinance of the moon who is she oh she's not very brilliant man has walked on her man ever walked on the sun man never ever landed a rocket on the sun but he's walked all over the moon took pictures of the moon make fun of color this and that and the other come on sheldon let them go ahead and walk all over this bride walk all over the moon let them do whatever they want to do but god's fixing the rights of this bride god's fixing to take her into his glory and he will clown her queen he amen he will clown her queen because in her humility she reflected the son not herself not our own agenda it's an ordinance and every predestinated seed of god to give him the glory oh god listen to this if the earth would tilt on its axis the orbit around it this would make for extreme differences between temperatures and daylight throughout the year and what controls it the moon so if the moon was not there the extreme variety of the temperatures and the wobbling of the earth and the lengths of the days you understand what causes the length of the days on the earth the moon how long will this age go out the moon will dictate that the readiness of the church however long it needed to propagate the message of luther over the earth that's how god longed god but let it go however long it's needed to reach the methodist that's how long god will let it go not timing it according to napoleon not pounding it according to some great leader somewhere but according to the dictates of the needs of the moon however long we need to reach that last seed that's how long we'll stay here it ain't got nothing to do with obama it ain't got nothing to do with the congress or senate they can't pass a law to delay the rapture or speed it up it ain't based on them it's based on the ministry of the moon who is she who is she if it wasn't for the effect of the moon the earth would be like this then she could be like this then she could do a total flip and be like that sounds like us before we first got saved don't you realize why we was in such chaos and then people want to take this away from me brother donny i don't understand this and that another i i understand what you're saying you don't understand cause there's lots of things i don't understand but i know one thing i'm better off right now than where i've ever been in my life before maybe some of you want to go to bad this method is pentecost that's up to you i was in pentecost oh yeah i wasn't preaching the big tents i was under big ministries and on television and this that and the other but all the time there's some dynamic brother ron i knew there had to be more and it wasn't miracles that got my sign up brother random i saw them at pentecost i prayed for the for the cross eyes and they straightened out in pentecost i prayed for cancers i prayed for tumors i've seen all kinds of miracles and pentecost that wasn't what got my attention it was the message from that prophet's mouth hallelujah it was what the rest of the world said oh it's a bunch of holy rollers but i looked at it and saw it's an ordinance of god [Applause] you see well all these defectors look at it all these do's and don'ts can't go here can't go there can't do this can't do that they look at it as prison walls i look at it as castle walls i'm in the castle of my king i'm not i'm not hell to prison or i'm here because i want to be oh hallelujah hold on message people they can't do this and they came to the and they can't go here they're held behind that wall this is my castle hallelujah this is my castle it is not a prison to me i am not a prisoner held back by do's and don'ts i'm a prisoner of love of love i do this because i love him people say how can you folks be free when you got all this list of do's and don'ts how can you all be free living in america in a democracy and yet if you own a piece of property that's in the certain zone you can't build any type of building you want to on it and you tell me you're free how come we have to pay income tax and then then people are praying white house is one spends our taxes now are you free or not well yeah i've been in china you're free compared to them so let me ask you if you build a nice house and you go into a certain subdivision and they got restrictions in that subdivision they can only build a house a certain certain size it got to be so-and-so can't have a hog a lot of dog lot a pig lot of bird lock all kinds of chickens and gooses and all that sort of thing hanging around you around these million dollar houses now what if they didn't have them in this real high dollar subdivision and some poor old boy pulls a single wide trailer in there in between a million and a half dollar house and a two million dollar house and he pulls up his chickens and his homes his hounds and his dogs and his hogs and his pigs and his sows and everything else and that neighborhood is smelled up now we ask you something do you figure them folks in there are so under bondage oh we can't have hogs in our subdivision oh they are so glad why those restrictions protect them my sisters the do's and the don'ts of this message it is not bondage it's protecting you from tribulation period it's keeping you from being thrown into a bed of tribulation or god will judge you as a prostitute [Applause] so god's got restrictions in his subdivision no bob-haired women no painted face no miniskirts that's to keep them kind of folks from moving in on top of you glory let me invite you when this life is over i'm fixing to move up to a gated community [Applause] if you'd like to come and go with me hey man i'm fixing to go to a gated community and the gates aren't of concrete they aren't of steel but the gates are a pure gold hallelujah pearls hanging around the streets of gold and the walls of jasper but you've got to live the right kind of life here to live in that retirement [Applause] community it is the longest running youth meeting that's ever been because everybody there will be 18 years old and nobody will get any older listen to this they are just beginning to find out in the last few years that the moon triggers part of the causes of earthquakes so when will that chunk three to four hundred miles wide 1500 miles long fall 40 miles down it'll be timed with the readiness of the moon on the earth i stood down on the lost sea several years ago down down in tennessee if you've never been there it's a really neat place if you like underground caves it's the largest lake in the world underground lake that they've seen so you can go down in these steps and down this sort of thing and they've got it all lighted up down there they have fish that totally blind and you know it's just a large underground lake and a cave it's a really neat place we saw several years ago and god was taking us through explaining this that and other strike times like mountain this night and other and he said the last fall that took place in this cave is estimated to be two thousand years ago two thousand years ago the head of the moon was on the earth matthew 27 53 we know that there was an earthquake and many of the saints many of the bodies of the saints which slept arose and entered in with him at his resurrection timed around what an earthquake [Applause] the moon has a very thin atmosphere so a layer of dust or a footprint can sit undisturbed for centuries for centuries even though we're seeding our soul our bodies and our memories can be hurt by one another by ourselves not like god we don't have access to the safe forgetfulness and that footprint where somebody walked on us can lay there for years of our lives especially if you don't ask the power of the sun to help you deal with it you can live with your complexes you can live with your fears or you can have victory over come on now a lot of folks in our message don't just need physical healing in the body you ever read the quote where brother bryan said that god would bring healing in their spirit a lot of folks in the message need a healing in their spirit they've got all kinds of wounds and all kinds of this and the other and they pack it around from church to church to church and their church hoppers here and church hoppers there they need a real good healing i said they need a real good healing so the power of the sun can be able to wipe away the footprints of man daytime temperatures on the sunny side of the moon reach 273 degrees fahrenheit on the dark side of the moon it's 243 degrees below zero i've had them days you know what i'm saying after a gate service man on saturday night or sunday morning or sunday night where there i mean you say come on devil come on [Applause] then by about three in the afternoon man it's cold it's only 242 fahrenheit you didn't even reach 243 minus yet how in the world can we call from such extremity how can we sit in heavenly places that brother tim talked about the last time and soar and so are where angels stand there and envy where we are and then an hour after church is over the kid will spill kool-aid or you go through mcdonald's to drive then they wind up a ketchup all over your new car i know most of your brothers here are so spiritual that don't bother you but this is for those who are still yet battling in the flesh oh you say brother donnie i'm i'm above that sort of thing it don't bother me so you mean to tell me it wouldn't bother you if you come home monday after work and your wife went out and bought a new lexus without you as telling her she could sisters hard to know these brothers say anything so i guess you're free to pick up alexis on monday then sure we're humans and it bothers us and we can go from one extreme to the other but does that happen to the sun does the sun have to always but the moon showed us all the glory oh jesus and the services are so wonderful you just think we're gonna leave here tonight i mean we're gonna be chains and then in the morning you issue us why you're like the moon your story is written in her cycles due to tidal friction caused by the moon the earth's rotation slows down over time as it slows our days get longer because the earth is spinning more slowly now you understand already we're going out of them longer days of summer right where you look at you when that nine o'clock or 9 30 or whatever and it's still daylight out there it's because of where the moon was and the friction upon the earth but now it started moving back in that cycle who told the who told the moon what if the computer ever goes down on the moon and the moon gets a computer saying and then delays don't worry it will never go down and still in the original creation it's still an original order when adam fell it did not affect the moon i don't know what item fell it did not change the moon which is you and the stars you have an identity there in the heavens and you're going back to where you come from [Applause] watch in isaiah chapter 30 verse 25 and there shall be every high mountain and upon every high hill rivers and streams of waters and the day of the great slaughter when the towers fall now listen very carefully this verse and moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days in the day the lord bindeth up the breach of his people so the light of the moon will reach the light of the sun and when it does the sun will manifest itself in a seven-fold strength and it's based upon the breach being healed in his people hallelujah to god aren't you glad there was a breach preached in this last day oh think of the children years and years ago whenever the children of israel had doubted god and they entered into unbelief and god told moses separate yourself from them and i'll kill them and god spoke to aaron wrote to moses and aaron speaks to moses and says take a censor and take fire off the altar and go out among the people wait a minute i thought blood was an atonement and yet moses told aaron go out there and make an atonement for the people and runs right out there in the judgment of god and the plague had already broke loose in the camp and aaron runs right out in the middle of it and he goes right to where it was oh hallelujah and the bible said he stood between the dead and the living he stood right there in the breach he stood right there face to face with the judgment of god and he stopped the judgment of god 14 700 people died in that plague the judgment of god was hanging over humanity but the lord god came down on the body of flesh and what did he do he sent jesus right there in the preach stood right there in the judgment of god and he stopped eternal death on your soul now you can no more die than god [Applause] [Music] when preachers preach about hell i don't dream about it i don't think about it because i ain't where i'm going would you preach about being lost that ain't me cause i ain't lost hallelujah i am his oh let me give you an example here the people of psycho in the book of john in the new testament they were touched they were helped they were ministered to by the light of the moon that's good i want you to listen they had the breaking of the moon through a reflected light called the woman at the well now think of this saint john 4 28 the woman then left her water pot and went away into the city and saith unto the men come see a man which told me all things ever i did it's not just a christ i already find it amazing with some of these new testament people they saw one thing i can't believe a man's prophet people in this day save tens of thousands of things and they're still not sure you realize these people that are crucifying this word if they lived in the days of jesus that crucified him because it is him they're crucifying today this woman saw one thing and said i perceive you our prophet nathaniel said thou art the son of god the king of israel was one thing now watch the moon now talking come see a man which told me all things ever i did is not this a good man he's a pretty good fella i'm really wondering if this guy might be he is not this the christ then they went out of the city and came unto him now what's verse 39 and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman jesus shining on her was reflecting his glory she had now become the moon now remember she had no saying among them no word among them no testimony they all know who she was and in a matter of time they saw such an illumination on this woman's life they shouldn't even listen to her it wasn't like six months later it'd been like a year later that way to try and prove her name she's going to be okay but she goes out that morning 15 minutes she comes by and there's such illumination on this woman that they stand there and listen to her testimony and they begin to believe brother sister we need more like that instead of leading people to the message we need to get them to the baptism of the holy ghost then let them read the message of thou and they'll grab a hold of it really right we've led a lot of them to the doctrines of the message but they ain't got a new verse come on now you might as well say amen these folks that are falling away from the message of thou they are not born again i don't care how much they shout how much they scream they don't have a new birth for the holy ghost [Applause] now watch verse 40. so when the samaritans were coming to him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode there two days and many more believed because of his own word now jesus is shining directly on them you understand this is what happens in our families this is what happens in revivals the revival start moving boy the whole preacher gets old on fire some of the church people get on fire and the light is shining from the sun directly onto brother so-and-so and sister so-and-so man they're all tore up boy i tell one thing hallelujah something's going on and somebody else if they're not careful they'll get under them beams of moonlight they'll say oh glory to god i fell with chill go all over around the shiver oh hallelujah god that ain't enough you have got to get in direct contact with the son himself and let the sun go to shining on you instead of you talking about mama's experience well brother ron's a good man brother so and so that's well and good but you want that sun shining on you [Applause] moonlight won't keep you very good in hell's region you see the moon is revealed in four stages first second third and fourth quarters she waxes and she wanes you all ought to be able to say amen to that you all waxing wayne too sometimes you all come in church in a kegan i couldn't move you other times you come in and a bumblebee can fly you from here to richmond and back you're waxing and waiting come on song leaders know it's the truth preachers know it's the truth i called brother tim several years ago and talking to everybody how you doing doing good how's the church doing oh he said they're not feeding very good right now church just goes through those times as individuals goes through those times why our type so she reaches her full moon but she don't stay there long she starts decreasing decreasing decreasing and then you get to where you get out at night you can't even already find her then boy here she comes you come start building back up again so she don't just pop right out but she begins to change herself from justification sanctification baptism holy ghost holy ghost himself and that she is oh you look at him oh my look at her look at her how beautiful she is you go back and look at her in a couple weeks you can't even find her you see my brother man describes to us how god made this earth and he said i can see a clinker a clicker he said let's step on the eternity he said let's step up here on the banister i've got a picture of my mind and he said god said let there be light and he said whenever he did a clinker and out of the sun come this planet and the logos moves over it and he lets it drop 150 million years and he [Applause] there he stops it and sets it in orbit another one he watches and it drops it drops and drops it drops he moves over and it rocks and finally it starts spinning and he said what was he doing god was writing his first bible you imagine whenever he started bringing this earth out and here comes the earth and drops down drops down drops down covered over with ice and the logos lets it fall fall fall and we live and what scientists call is the habitable part of the universe you see had we been 10 000 miles closer to the sun the temperature would be so hot no life could live on us if we was 5 000 miles farther out away from the sun it would be so cold life could not live on us so whoever put us where we are putted us where he wanted us and he put us in the habitable zone put all the seeds you want to on jupiter but they won't grow put all the seeds you want to on mars but they won't go come on with me now you put all the seeds a predestination of life on a baptist man that's a baptist from his soul he'll never make bride put it on a catholic he'll never make bride but if you put seed of life in a habitable zone of a predestinated life hallelujah it will bring forth life in spite of itself hallelujah hallelujah why because he put you in the habitable zone of his spiritual universe [Applause] so here comes this clinker covered with ice brother who said the logos let it fall and then he started turning around you know sister so like a rotisserie in your microwave so you put a put a chicken or a bowl of mac and cheese or whatever inside that little spinning table in your microwave and you go to zap and that dude and you punch that button and visit and all of a sudden it goes spinning around and the logos are spinning the earth and we start bringing over close to the sun the ice began to melt and he started cutting the big crevices down through the grand canyon oh scientists want to say well i'll tell you one thing it was so many years ago a dinosaur come down through here and walk down through there and all the waters come up through here and washed all that out my question is what happened to all that dirt that was in there where'd it go i don't see any of that piled up down there i know enough about digging holes and i was a boy to know if you take a certain amount of dirt out of so-and-so there's gonna be a pile of dirt over here so if all that dirt come out of that grand canyon where'd it all go to it wasn't him moving the dirt it was my father now you look at this arse and trace her back to origination and if she comes from the sun let's peel back the crust let's go back past the surface let's build back down on the core of the earth and what do we find burning fire she in her soul reflects where she come from you peel back my humanity pull back your humanity and what do you look down inside of a soul which come from god you love him moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be seven fold as the light of seven days think of where we are the light of seven days has culminated in the age we are living we are not just going to live a good life let me close for us to be able to make it through this age and barely get by and barely hold on pray for me that i can hold on save your prayers for something else i'm not gonna barely hold on when i get there that day jesus ain't going to hand me a t-shirt i survived laodicea oh jesus jesus i made it [Applause] they now testimony to you lord i ain't barely gonna make it [Applause] come on children i'm living here by an ordinance of god i am not ordained to barely make it i am ordained to go through this life a victorious son of god god never ordains you to barely hang on god never ordained you to live and your mind in total torment of your past sins that whom the son hath made free is free nt [Applause] a preacher texted me the other day from texas and said how you doing said i'm fighting the devil and winning that just shocks people look friends i want hell to know that i have lived on this earth if you folks have to preach my funeral and brother tim me and him count out an agreement years ago if i go first he preaches mind if he goes first i preach he is hopefully we get to go together but i'll tell you one thing if he has to preach mine i hope there is an absolute revival down in hell whenever they hear donny reagan's gone i hope they go to shouting and jumping around down that hill and said i am so glad that holy roller has gone from there i don't want to just have a testimony among you but i want hell to know i have lived on this earth i want demons to know there's been another son of god on the earth that reflected the power of the son jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world greater greater than your sickness greater than your oppression who is she who is she here's beloved oh hallelujah oh brother donny don't you ever have no trials when you got a few thousand years come sit down with me i'll tell you about sure i have them but i'm going to let him get me down come on children brother branham said a man or woman can live so close to god that the devil don't know what to do with them it ought to be when you saints get up in the morning and the devil watches that first move of your toe twitching or yeah i have it as you wake up and the devil said oh no oh no i want my testimony to be so down in hell that when the devil says all right time to change guard with donnie reagan who wants to go over and aggravate him i want them devil sister whoop i mean crying like whoop pups [Music] wouldn't you hate to have the testimony down in hell that devils are waiting in line for their weak on you some folks that come to church i imagine hale would cry self to death if they died cause they're the biggest troublemaker in church but it ought to be whenever say hell says oh it's time for a guard change who wants to go over and tack run he gets all strung out and all stressed out and he gets there he goes to praying and goes to talking in some kind of language and goes shouting and jerking around i know i've got him defeated i know i have he comes out there like a bulldozer oh it's easy for you to sit down here in hell you're not the one that has to go full children ain't that kind of testimony you want to have a child of god why because the strength of the sun is so shining on your life this power hits together hello we can be perfectly honest with each other before god maybe you're not that kind of christian today maybe you're standing here tonight and you you're a thousand miles from living a victorious life as we'd say you don't have to remain that way it don't have to be that on you you can live the kind of life by the sun shining directly on you and people may pick you up as you would a rock off the moon and look at you people may walk all over you do you understand that the tracks from the buggies that they rove the moon they're still there atmosphere on the moon does not change a lot love you bear your scars of humanity and all the things that you've been through you can let that guide you or you can be guided by the power of the sun your life is not your own if you're here tonight your children has got you all downs sickness maybe divided home who knows what it is remember the lord god has set you here amen you think this world is bad now you wait to the rapture oh children we look at it now and every event that happens it's getting one day closer to him saying i can't stand for her to live there another day praise god don't you want to leave this world victorious how many would like to be remembered in prayer please nobody looking around nobody's going to embarrass you pull on you nothing like that you just have to raise your hand before god maybe something in your home something on your job something in your body god knows what it is heavenly father i pray you take this little simple thoughts father god may it ring so true in our souls forgive us lord jesus for not reflecting more of the power of the sun we still reflect so much of our humanity the trademarks of people and our birth paths and all that that's so prevalent in our lives help us lord jesus we know that it affects us we know it does we believe the power of the sun can shine if it could move on a woman that was ill-famed and in a matter of moments that woman changed from a a woman of absolute hated among the people but the strength of the sun so shined on her life in a matter of moments that people come to hear about jesus by her testimony oh god you saw the hands of your people that were uplifted maybe some that'll see this video or hear the service lord jesus may you be able to reach to them as well lord i have this prayer cult in my hand tonight you know what it's about i'm asking your father in the name of jesus may you come to the visible audience may you minister to us maybe some people hear this now and they think i wish i could be that way i wish i could live that kind of life the lord help them to see much of their life is to do with how they expect you to move in their lives as the prophet said as much as our faith will be released that's what we can have help us tonight lord all of us we can say we can move up who is she she is the elect of god who is this coming from the wilderness was her beloved leaning on her arms who is this coming from bourgeois with his dad garments on who is she the queen of heaven who is she in her summed up the eternal wisdom and purpose of god thank you lord jesus my moon eyes can't see that well but shine on that heart shine on me so we can see who we are lord this brother tim preacher is not that atmosphere set it in heavenly places in christ pull us up to where the moon and the sun her husband and wife granted lord jesus praise god can we just raise our hands in the presence of the kingdom you love him with all your heart saints and you're wonderful maybe you find yourself tonight out of sorts and you're just wobbling wobbling maybe you've been in and out and up and down in church maybe you've already got something you felt like from god but friends you got to go beyond the reflected moonlight from your mama or your daddy or your pastor you've got to go where you or yourself so in line with the orbit that the sun himself shines on you with his own light and you become a reflector of his glory your humanity you look at that there's nothing shining about this there's nothing listening about it how can you see god through a preacher that stands up and preaches it's reflected glory how could we see god through brother branham through moses through elijah reflected glory they were able to get themselves out of the way and the sun able to shine upon that moon and we looked and saw the moon side as god shined it down oh this is what he wants praise god the moon is coming into the glory of the sun and the sun will reflect itself in sevenfold glory and all those previous ages behind us are gonna raise when what when the moon comes to her final cycle praise be to god oh i know it's hard for us to comprehend but the prophet tells us that resurrection that holy ghost power that lives in you you will call your own body in the resurrection hallelujah why the resurrection of the moon and the sun will become so personified he said therefore what happens if you have died and entered into the theophany you will bring the theophany the theophany will come to the earth to meet you and if you are here you will take the body to meet the theophany you who you the gene of god you the attribute of god you will take your body to meet the theophany hallelujah come on [Music] hallelujah hallelujah as i look out across the land and see god's mighty hand the bride across the door in her wedding girl just like in the days of old who they stood encouragement they turned that old upside down she's rising up rising up there's a new testament church rising up we're rising up or rising up there's a new testament church rising up now the bible plainly tells how the holy ghost fell signs and wonders were done by the apostle's hand demon spirits were cast out in the jail they sing and shout while surrounded by god's holy angel band we're rising up or rising up up there's a new testament church rising up

place to where i find solitude a lot of times at night i'll go out on the back porch and there's trees that's there about 60 80 foot tall and god made me a beautiful great big telescope you see at my house there's no lights that you can see we live in the middle of the woods and you can look right straight up on a uncloudy night you can see all of those beautiful stars just shining so brightly and god put every one of them in their place but you see we're looking up and he's looking down and in god's great big telescope brother tim he's looking down and he looks down in louisiana and there's all kind of darkness but there's some lights down there and you may feel like there's a lot of darkness around you and it you're made to be just that way oh didn't you enjoy that tonight hallelujah and i'd say you could take that message to a lot of these big denominational churches and they wouldn't have a clue what he was talking about but to the gene seed of god they can say amen to every word of that hallelujah well how did brother branham know so much about that how's brother don and brother tim and all these guys know so much about it you see they're in contact with the sun and
