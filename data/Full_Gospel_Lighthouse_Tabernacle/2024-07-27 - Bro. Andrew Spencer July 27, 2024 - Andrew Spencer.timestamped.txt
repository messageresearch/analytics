[28:14] so thankful every every Saturday I just
[28:17] thank you that we could just come to a

[28:21] just long all through the week that we
[28:22] could just come and be able to come and
[28:24] just be with you Lord and be in a
[28:27] presence of just like-minded people that

[28:56] lift these prayer requests up to you
[28:58] that we're not doing this as a ritual
[28:59] we're not doing this just as to be able
[29:01] to let anyone know who's sick or we're
[29:04] doing this in power Lord we know that we
[29:06] know that we have the word here and the
[29:08] word in spirit is what it takes in this
[29:10] day and I would just hear the prophet
[29:12] today as he would talk about how we need
[29:13] the Dynamics and the mechanics and the
[29:15] Dynamics is what makes this message live
[29:18] Lord and I just believe that we have the
[29:20] the money in the bank to be able to cash
[29:22] those checks and Lord I just pray that
[29:24] you would just come in each and every
[29:25] one of these prayer requests there's
[29:27] many dire need you see sister Pat there

[29:31] the way that they would go there and I
[29:33] just feel as it it almost seems that
[29:34] Satan is attacking every every week with
[29:37] another another cancer case but Lord
[29:40] Jesus you are the one and only that can
[29:41] come down the great physician that can
[29:43] heal over over each and every one of
[29:45] these Lord Jesus it's not just one it's
[29:47] not one greater than another Lord Jesus
[29:49] if you would just come and I just
[29:51] believe that you could take every Cancer
[29:53] cell out of out of the entire bride that
[29:55] we have here that's the God that I serve
[29:57] and Lord Jesus I'm looking for a for a
[29:59] day that you come and not only just heal
[30:01] us of cancer and heal us of sickness and
[30:04] the injuries and things that the that
[30:05] just living this life and being human
[30:07] brings but Lord Jesus you you take and
[30:09] change our whole entire bodies Lord in
[30:11] the Rapture and Lord I just long for
[30:13] that day and I just ask that you would

[49:44] thank you Lord so I want to give a a
[49:47] small
[49:49] background
[49:54] um on my life oh and also don't want to
[49:58] forget my pastor Brother David Iverson I
[50:01] I texted him said I have to I not I have
[50:03] to but well I have to give my
[50:06] testimony this when they asked me said
[50:09] oh I'm going to die I said I'm going to
[50:12] die
[50:13] but if if my nerves get on control I
[50:17] think I'll do all right yeah so uh but
[50:20] David ion giv you gives his
[50:23] greetings so um
[50:30] this can go so I was raised in a
[50:33] Christian family my daddy was a pastor
[50:36] in a small Church in
[50:37] Brussels
[50:40] um there was six children four boys two
[50:43] girls that was the third one in line um
[50:47] we had we had all we we
[50:49] needed we weren't very rich but God
[50:52] provided and we have what we
[50:54] needed so bro my dad he truly
[50:59] lived the life that's he truly lived he
[51:02] loved this message message and he lived
[51:05] it sadly I realized this after him
[51:08] passing away that's
[51:12] something that's hard to handle because
[51:16] he was he was truly a general he was I
[51:19] mean he went out to
[51:22] places yeah I I wish I was with him at
[51:27] at those times but it was a different
[51:32] plan I remember very well how I started
[51:34] drifting away must I been
[51:38] 21 my friend bought me my first beer I
[51:42] did not buy it he just pushed it into my
[51:45] hands and that's how I went downhill
[51:48] very very fast drinking that was the
[51:51] thing I I did I was good at it
[52:02] sometimes I went
[52:03] home standing behind the corner seating
[52:06] my dad and family going to church so I
[52:08] could go in house and get some sleep
[52:11] that was 8:00 830 I was waiting just for
[52:15] them to go to church so I could get my
[52:16] sleep and go to bed
[52:19] drunk if I'm going too fast or not
[52:22] speaking properly just raise your hands
[52:25] okay no what did so I'm good I'm good
[52:29] okay so so that that went on for our
[52:34] well for for a long
[52:36] time you know when you have a thirst in
[52:39] your heart you want to fill with
[52:42] something you want to F with something
[52:45] is it alcohol is it is it lust you want
[52:47] there's a void that wants to be filled
[52:50] and I I use the wrong the wrong um uh
[52:54] longings to feel that void
[52:58] so that was
[53:00] something yeah I just I tried alcohol
[53:04] just to get away to to to have a good
[53:06] feeling
[53:07] to just you know I many times I called
[53:11] my dad crying in the night just weeping
[53:15] said
[53:18] Daddy I'm not going to make it because
[53:21] you know
[53:22] inside there's a truth somewhere and I
[53:25] know I could call my dad any
[53:28] time one time I called him it was in the
[53:31] afternoon I said
[53:33] that I think I'm dying please pray for
[53:37] me CU Satan he he will oh he will he
[53:41] will keep attacking you he will drag you
[53:44] along and then he would drop you just
[53:45] like you're nothing and he he he did it
[53:48] a couple of
[53:49] times
[53:52] so I I can tell you many stories how God
[53:55] spared my life
[53:57] life I wrecked a few
[54:01] cars I don't know how many I think two
[54:04] or three but
[54:05] I sometimes I woke up in the morning
[54:08] where's my car at I I had to find look
[54:11] where my car is finding a bumper
[54:14] missing one time I hit my car in a in a
[54:18] tree i l in a ditch next morning I went
[54:21] up to find to get the car I called um
[54:26] what you call the the trucks who who um
[54:29] tow
[54:30] truck so the the the thing was there was
[54:33] a brother from the church in in Gent he
[54:36] just drove by on his bike I
[54:39] said I said why why now so he he knew I
[54:43] was drunk so but he didn't say too much
[54:46] but I I felt so so ashamed of that but
[54:51] that wasn't still enough for me to come
[54:55] back that wasn't that wasn't enough
[55:01] so one
[55:05] time me and my buddies so-called buddies
[55:08] wanted to go to
[55:10] um to a club disco club disc probably
[55:13] club right um we we uh took off with
[55:17] three cars there
[55:19] was me and a guy who drove like crazy I
[55:22] mean he was like he was speeding passing
[55:25] cars and
[55:28] along the way we had to stop we couldn't
[55:29] find the the the the club so we all got
[55:33] out of the car and there was uh the car
[55:35] behind him was four girls and said
[55:37] Isaiah please come with us come with us
[55:39] this guy is driving crazy you you you
[55:42] get a wreck so no I'm fine we'll we
[55:44] we'll make it we'll just have to find a
[55:46] way so we take off again 2 minutes later
[55:49] I'm I'm at the car with the that crazy
[55:52] guy who drove like I don't know a car
[55:55] from the other side
[55:58] missed us like few inches and hit the
[56:01] car behind me with the four
[56:03] girls two broke their
[56:06] backs I pulled them
[56:09] out and I know God spread my life one
[56:12] more time
[56:15] just he Satan
[56:18] can he can he can touch you but he can
[56:21] take you
[56:23] away so
[56:26] God saved my
[56:28] life many times many times I wish I
[56:31] could all I could all tell you what God
[56:33] has been doing for
[56:35] me so um this lifestyle
[56:40] continued and at 27 years
[56:44] old I met my wife uh my future wife
[56:51] Julie I always say she was 17 years old
[56:54] when we started dating but in in fact it
[56:56] was 16 and N
[56:58] months so that was yeah so you can
[57:02] imagine me and her dad wasn't wasn't
[57:04] best friends in the
[57:06] beginning now we get along very well
[57:09] but so Julie she
[57:13] um she never heard about the message
[57:16] they have some Catholic backgrounds and
[57:19] but don't do not practice it just me
[57:21] before
[57:23] um um if somebody dies or um you know
[57:26] what they practice in Catholic church
[57:31] so we stayed together until
[57:37] 2011 but because of the drinking and the
[57:39] party Ang Julie said she she would she
[57:42] would leave me she she couldn't handle
[57:43] it no more you know
[57:46] what if you have a house a
[57:49] home and you want to work work work and
[57:52] then go to a bar not go home is because
[57:54] you it's not a happy home
[57:56] so so I I I broke her heart many many
[58:02] times so 2011 I promised said listen I
[58:07] will stop the drinking I will go back to
[58:09] church because I did not want to lose my
[58:14] wife and you know how you start you know
[58:17] what I will I will skip the beer and the
[58:20] alcohol but I will stay with the
[58:24] wine that wasn't getting any
[58:27] better
[58:30] so I stopped doing that
[58:35] also I went to church for a couple of
[58:37] months so that was
[58:39] 2011 but Julie then she saw this is this
[58:43] is from the one extreme to the to the
[58:45] other to the other side of the extreme
[58:47] not that for me I had some rest but it
[58:50] it was it was like me doing it I can do
[58:54] this I can stop the drinking and the go
[58:56] out just to save my relationship with
[58:59] with my wife
[59:02] but no that that didn't work so we broke
[59:06] up for a couple of months I went to
[59:10] church we had we had some contact but
[59:13] not a lot
[59:16] but I broke her heart
[59:19] and mine was broken
[59:22] too see Satan he will he will Dag you
[59:26] alone he will drop you he will drop you
[59:28] just like my
[59:31] youth
[59:35] so when I came so I went to to a couple
[59:38] of meetings went to Canada and but
[59:41] that's still that's still same void I
[59:43] still had it just I just I just couldn't
[59:46] find I just couldn't find uh peace and
[59:50] rest I started backsliding again dropped
[59:53] out of church
[59:58] got in contact with Julie
[1:00:00] again I I I don't know why he even she
[1:00:03] even took me back but it must have been
[1:00:05] for the grace of God it was meant to
[1:00:08] be so we got married and we got married
[1:00:12] in
[1:00:13] 2015 uh we got married in Italy the
[1:00:17] place called
[1:00:19] deoi I think five five years later we
[1:00:21] found out it means God willing didn't I
[1:00:25] did not know no this so we got married
[1:00:27] there in the place called
[1:00:30] de
[1:00:33] so but still the still the drinking that
[1:00:36] was that was yeah so we had a
[1:00:40] shield uh our first
[1:00:42] born I got the date right this time 18
[1:00:45] April
[1:00:48] 2016 Billy was
[1:00:50] born March 29th
[1:00:53] 2018 but again
[1:00:57] we not have a happy home I would just go
[1:01:00] out
[1:01:02] even work Saturdays not to be home
[1:01:05] because I can do whatever I want on
[1:01:07] Saturday I said I I'll go to work and at
[1:01:09] 12:00 I was in
[1:01:12] restaurants with
[1:01:14] friends having well I won't say dinner
[1:01:18] was more drinking party
[1:01:22] so I'm not proud of that no I just
[1:01:28] alcohol is
[1:01:32] something it will take you it it will
[1:01:35] take you so far
[1:01:37] it's it's not only alcohol it's other
[1:01:40] things but I don't want to get into that
[1:01:41] because that some things
[1:01:44] I you get the scars and that that will
[1:01:47] stay that will stay until um I get my
[1:01:50] glorified body but I have scars that I I
[1:01:53] am I you know I I don't want to talk
[1:01:56] about that but so but my our marriage
[1:01:58] was
[1:02:00] wrecked fast forward
[1:02:07] 2019 our Mar was just wrecked Julie
[1:02:11] called my dad B A gido she said I'm at
[1:02:14] the end of the road divorce was Insight
[1:02:17] it was just a matter of time and she
[1:02:21] would take the kids and
[1:02:24] just move move out
[1:02:30] you know what my dad said to Julie said
[1:02:32] you know what keep praying for
[1:02:36] him so Julia
[1:02:39] uh I will say I won't I won't say it now
[1:02:42] but then she was an un unbeliever she
[1:02:44] didn't know God but she said you know
[1:02:46] what I tried everything I will ask God
[1:02:51] to see my husband's getting
[1:02:54] saved so
[1:02:58] 2019 1 of November
[1:03:01] bro suddenly passed away just my my
[1:03:05] world just it just fell
[1:03:09] apart that day the drinking
[1:03:14] stopped somehow Julie felt
[1:03:18] this would change everything I she just
[1:03:22] had this feeling this will change
[1:03:24] everything but because she
[1:03:26] knew the life my my parents and family
[1:03:29] lived that was something special so she
[1:03:33] said we should go to
[1:03:35] church on
[1:03:37] Sunday and their life
[1:03:39] began for next couple of
[1:03:47] months a thirst came into my heart for
[1:03:49] reading the Bible and the message just
[1:03:53] constantly listening reading my Bible a
[1:03:57] hunger for
[1:03:58] God in January we had the meetings when
[1:04:02] for the young people um Newport meetings
[1:04:05] when we had last year last year brother
[1:04:07] uh Andrew came so but this was the
[1:04:09] meetings in
[1:04:10] 2020 so the 3rd of January brother
[1:04:13] Timothy Peru spoke a message born of
[1:04:17] fire oh man that was that was changing
[1:04:21] that was changing the end of the service
[1:04:24] he made an alter call
[1:04:26] I didn't have like the the feeling to go
[1:04:28] up Suddenly something spoke
[1:04:31] Isaiah you go
[1:04:37] forward I went I went forward
[1:04:40] and Brother David
[1:04:43] mayor started praying for
[1:04:46] me I I don't I I I prayed I don't even
[1:04:49] know what I said but in 10 seconds God
[1:04:53] came down and filled my
[1:04:56] whole life with his Holy
[1:04:58] Ghost and from that on I knew I found I
[1:05:03] I I I I found what what I was looking
[1:05:05] for I found what I was looking for I
[1:05:08] found that on that day third of
[1:05:12] January
[1:05:14] so God gave me something special and
[1:05:17] when I gave my T testimony in in Newport
[1:05:20] I didn't mention that but when this
[1:05:23] happened
[1:05:25] you know what surround system is Right
[1:05:27] surround
[1:05:28] systems I heard a
[1:05:30] choir from this side and from that side
[1:05:34] going back and forth back and forth it
[1:05:38] was just amazing to hear that choir sing
[1:05:41] it was just I mean it was something
[1:05:44] amazing I can never forget
[1:05:46] that so that was just something God gave
[1:05:50] me something extra to carry this so
[1:05:56] but of course uh Julie was with me in
[1:06:00] that in that youth meetings and she was
[1:06:03] in the room
[1:06:04] so I go up to the room I said
[1:06:07] Julie I finally found what I what I was
[1:06:11] looking for she looks me in the ey she I
[1:06:15] think she thought I was crazy I don't
[1:06:16] know but she looks up okay Isaiah I'm
[1:06:20] very happy for you so but then she she
[1:06:24] saw the change in my my life and she
[1:06:27] said that this is something special
[1:06:28] because I knew him before it's not the
[1:06:31] same husband I have now so she she was
[1:06:35] like okay this is he started coming to
[1:06:38] church with
[1:06:39] me just actually in the beginning
[1:06:41] because I was happy I found my
[1:06:44] rest but then she didn't
[1:06:47] experience and she gave her hearts a
[1:06:50] couple months later she was baptized and
[1:06:53] gave her heart to Christ so so if you
[1:06:57] talk about a
[1:06:59] miracle well I guess here I
[1:07:03] stand God bless you all
[1:07:39] we would all be happy to see someone get
[1:07:41] out of a
[1:07:43] wheelchair
[1:07:45] on or for cancer to
[1:07:48] leave but those are the greatest
[1:07:50] Miracles amen that's eternal
[1:07:55] that's
[1:07:58] Eternal Hallelujah that's
[1:08:16] Eternal you know God has determined I
[1:08:19] will not lose
[1:08:22] one if you have a loved one that's just
[1:08:25] walking in a very very rough way you get
[1:08:28] them to watch this you get them to watch
[1:08:31] this
[1:08:33] bear drugs the wrong kind of living
[1:08:36] doesn't
[1:08:38] satisfy that thirst CU if you're a child
[1:08:41] of God there's only one thing that will
[1:08:45] satisfy it and that's what you found
[1:08:48] right there amen sister Beth I think
[1:08:50] you're scheduled to sing this evening is
[1:08:52] that correct am I right sister Beth God
[1:08:55] bless you you can be seated I want to
[1:08:57] make sure that you heard something

[1:09:05] Lord he heard a
[1:09:07] choir a Heavenly Choir singing both on
[1:09:10] his left and on his right and there was
[1:09:14] no choir in the
[1:09:16] building but Dimensions Blended for him

[1:14:22] house of the Lord amen man we've we've
[1:14:26] had a very wonderful week and uh we're
[1:14:29] so so happy to have our friends from
[1:14:31] Belgium here with us it it means so much
[1:14:33] to have them here they brother Isaiah
[1:14:36] has become a a real friend to me and uh
[1:14:39] the past few years just getting to know
[1:14:41] him and being uh being around his dad's
[1:14:45] Ministry has certainly certainly
[1:14:47] impacted our life here at Full Gospel
[1:14:49] Lighthouse and has meant a lot to the
[1:14:51] ministry here and uh to be acquainted
[1:14:54] with his brother brother Joshua and his
[1:14:56] sisters and brother Isaiah we just we're
[1:14:58] very blessed people and and uh last
[1:15:01] night we we had an event uh take place
[1:15:05] uh uh we had a a date night here for uh
[1:15:10] for all the married couples here and uh
[1:15:12] that was a that was a really neat deal
[1:15:15] and uh it was it was super enjoyable and
[1:15:18] uh I don't think we've ever laughed so
[1:15:20] hard in our life and uh it it was it was
[1:15:23] rather enjoyable and we found out
[1:15:26] that we found out a lot of us ain't
[1:15:28] painters and
[1:15:30] uh and so they they had a little deal
[1:15:33] where basically the husband had to paint
[1:15:35] the wife and the wife had to paint the
[1:15:36] husband and just basically give a
[1:15:38] portrait and uh brother alen wins the
[1:15:41] award for the worst painter in the
[1:15:43] building and
[1:15:47] uh and I wasn't too far behind
[1:15:51] him but you know I was thinking about
[1:15:54] those things we we have these youth
[1:15:55] events every weekend we have we have
[1:15:58] these events like that and you think
[1:16:00] about the the denominations and the
[1:16:03] outside world they have to have those
[1:16:05] events to get people to come to
[1:16:07] church but we have church and then those
[1:16:10] things are added benefits to our to our
[1:16:13] church and we I think it's so powerful
[1:16:15] to realize that you don't need some
[1:16:17] event to keep you coming to church you
[1:16:19] don't have to have some you don't have
[1:16:21] to have some system you don't have to
[1:16:23] have somebody socialize you to keep keep
[1:16:25] you to come into church but the Holy
[1:16:27] Spirit drives you and fills you and
[1:16:29] wants you to be hungry for the power of
[1:16:31] God and it's it's a wonderful thing to
[1:16:33] enjoy those things but this is what a
[1:16:35] real Christian feeds on we don't feed on
[1:16:38] events we we have a gym we have those
[1:16:40] nice things but the word of God is our
[1:16:43] strength and it is it's our everything
[1:16:45] and I tell you we're just a blessed
[1:16:47] people and we we ask that you'd be
[1:16:50] praying for us this week brother Ron and
[1:16:52] myself will be headed to Canada to speak
[1:16:54] in brother Tom Ray and brother Michael's

[1:17:18] remembering Us in those meetings we

[1:22:05] we follow unto know the Lord that is
[1:22:07] going forth is prepared as the morning
[1:22:09] and he shall come up unto us as the rain

[1:22:14] the earth oh Ephraim what shall I do
[1:22:16] unto thee Oh Judah what shall I do unto
[1:22:19] thee for your goodness is as the morning
[1:22:21] cloud and as the early do it goeth away
[1:22:24] therefore I have hewed them out by the
[1:22:26] prophets I have slain them by the words
[1:22:28] of my mouth and thy judgments are as the
[1:22:31] light that goeth forth for I desired
[1:22:33] mercy and not sacrifice and the
[1:22:35] knowledge of God more than burnt
[1:22:37] offerings and they like men have
[1:22:40] transgress the Covenant and there ha
[1:22:42] they have dealt treacherously against me
[1:22:45] Gilead is a city of them that work
[1:22:48] iniquity and is polluted with blood and
[1:22:50] as troops of robbers wait for a man so
[1:22:53] the company of the priest murder in the
[1:22:55] way by consent for they commit lewdness
[1:22:58] I have seen an horrible thing in the
[1:23:00] house of Israel there is whoredom of
[1:23:02] Ephraim Israel is defiled also oh Judah
[1:23:06] he hath set an Harvest for thee when I
[1:23:10] returned the Captivity of my people now
[1:23:13] we we know that by by studying and being
[1:23:16] Bible Believers we know that throughout
[1:23:18] the course of time that Israel has
[1:23:20] became and was a scattered people from
[1:23:23] her from her Homeland we realize that
[1:23:25] that Israel can never be blessed outside
[1:23:27] of her home and and when Israel begins
[1:23:29] to get scattered they begin to get their
[1:23:31] eyes upon they get their eyes upon false
[1:23:34] gods and false things and they begin to
[1:23:36] invite false things into their worship
[1:23:39] and here as we' read in Hosea chapter 6
[1:23:42] we realize that that Hosea has been
[1:23:44] scattered and she that Israel has played
[1:23:47] the part of a harlot and brother Brandon
[1:23:49] would use these or or the he would use
[1:23:51] these words in the message recognizing
[1:23:54] your day in its message and you read it
[1:23:55] here in Hosea that he that uh Israel was
[1:23:59] scattered they were torn and they were
[1:24:01] blinded do you see the reason why they
[1:24:03] were that way was because they had
[1:24:05] forsaken the true and living God they
[1:24:07] had forgot his statutes and when you
[1:24:09] begin to read the book of Hosea that the
[1:24:12] book of Hosea is in three different
[1:24:14] parts and the first part is the
[1:24:16] Dishonored wife and even Hosea takes
[1:24:18] unto him and marries a harlot and a and
[1:24:21] then then that Harlot returns unto to
[1:24:24] her ways but if you go to reading Hosea
[1:24:27] the book of Hosea that there Hosea
[1:24:29] becomes to her and he restores her back
[1:24:32] to his her position as his wife in the
[1:24:35] second part of Hosea he begins to
[1:24:37] describe what the sinful people but he
[1:24:39] doesn't leave them there but God
[1:24:41] restores them and the third part is the
[1:24:44] ultimate blessing and the glory of
[1:24:46] Israel and it is said that the book of
[1:24:48] Hosea is summed up with two words that
[1:24:51] is loami which you can read there in
[1:24:53] chapter 2 meaning not my people and the
[1:24:56] word Amy which means my people and it's
[1:25:00] a powerful thing when you begin to read
[1:25:01] the context of Hosea when you begin to
[1:25:04] look at it when you begin to see them
[1:25:06] that God was rejecting them and then you
[1:25:08] begin to see God begin to return them
[1:25:11] back un un the word of God and brother
[1:25:13] Brandon he uses this text of Hosea
[1:25:16] chapter 6 on recognizing your day and
[1:25:18] its message and brother brandham he goes
[1:25:20] in there and he said then notice hoseah
[1:25:22] after two days he said he would return
[1:25:24] them to them he would he would receive
[1:25:27] he would receive and give us or revive
[1:25:30] us he said now revive doesn't mean
[1:25:32] Resurrection revive there mean it is the
[1:25:35] same word as used anywhere else he said
[1:25:37] I just looked it up he said it means a
[1:25:40] Revival he will revive us after two days
[1:25:43] that would that that would be in the
[1:25:45] third day that he would revive us again
[1:25:47] after he scattered us and blinded us and
[1:25:50] tore us and there brother brandham lays
[1:25:52] out some very powerful powerful message
[1:25:55] and Powerful things and Keynotes there
[1:25:57] in that message but there we recognize
[1:26:00] that that two days is not like 24 hours
[1:26:03] but a a day is like a thousand years
[1:26:05] unto the Lord and it's so it's there
[1:26:07] 2,000 years and it's been over 2700
[1:26:11] years that this has has been transpiring
[1:26:13] but notice what the Bible said that
[1:26:15] after two days that we shall live in his
[1:26:18] sight that we shall have life in his
[1:26:20] sight that we shall live in his sight
[1:26:22] which means to have eternal life in his
[1:26:24] sight you see you see the Jews have been
[1:26:27] dead to the fact that the Church of the
[1:26:29] Living God has been living under a
[1:26:31] Pentecostal Feast but in the third day
[1:26:34] that God is going to turn his eyes from
[1:26:36] the Gentiles and he's going to turn it
[1:26:38] back to the Jews you see is literally
[1:26:41] after 2,000 years of a Pentecostal Feast
[1:26:44] but we recognize that the hour that
[1:26:46] we're living in after after 2,000 over
[1:26:49] over 2,000 years to see that the Church
[1:26:51] of the Living God is in her position but
[1:26:54] the church that Israel is in her
[1:26:56] position and to think that it's at a
[1:26:58] spot where the six-star flag of David is
[1:27:01] flying over a nation it's been it's been
[1:27:04] there it's it's the first time in
[1:27:06] history in many many thousands of years
[1:27:09] that the that Israel is back in her
[1:27:11] Homeland and those Jews are there
[1:27:13] waiting they're waiting on their Messiah
[1:27:15] they don't even realize they don't even
[1:27:17] realize how they got back there but they
[1:27:20] but the spirit of God begin to call them
[1:27:22] to come back to their Homeland and and
[1:27:24] the reason of it being is that the Jews
[1:27:26] are there waiting they're waiting there
[1:27:29] on the Feast of the trumpets they're
[1:27:30] waiting there for a time that they are
[1:27:33] going to recognize the atonement and
[1:27:35] notice this that the Church of God has
[1:27:38] has missed their day the church the the
[1:27:41] church world has missed there they they
[1:27:43] have not recognized what is taking place
[1:27:46] the church world has not recognized what
[1:27:48] is taking place but God has recognized
[1:27:50] what has taking place when when men turn
[1:27:53] down throughout the year throughout the
[1:27:54] Bible History men would turn down
[1:27:57] prophets but God always recognized those
[1:27:59] prophets and if God would ever send a
[1:28:01] prophet then he would have a people that
[1:28:03] would believe what that Prophet is
[1:28:05] saying you see the church is blind like
[1:28:08] balam like balam was blind to the angel
[1:28:11] just like it is said in this generation
[1:28:13] in Revelation chapter 3 that that this
[1:28:15] layout of see an age is blind and
[1:28:17] they're naked and they don't even know
[1:28:19] it it's just like the Jews that they
[1:28:21] were blinded but they don't even know
[1:28:23] that they're blind minded but you see
[1:28:25] they're there they they got there by the
[1:28:27] wings of an eagle they were they were
[1:28:29] placed back there in the middle of the
[1:28:30] night the spirit of God begin to drive
[1:28:33] them back to their Homeland when when
[1:28:35] when all of the the Pol the the
[1:28:38] political worlds they drove them out of
[1:28:40] there brother Brandon would say it like
[1:28:42] this that he said that National Force
[1:28:44] put Israel national Force pushed her out
[1:28:47] but the spirit of God put her back in
[1:28:49] that place and to think that that there
[1:28:51] you begin to see that the very same
[1:28:53] night that William Bram is receiving a
[1:28:56] commission from the Lord that if you
[1:28:58] will get the people to believe you that
[1:29:01] not even pray that not even cancer would
[1:29:03] stand before your prayer and that he
[1:29:06] would give him a sign he would give him
[1:29:07] a commission he would stand there under
[1:29:09] under the confirmation of that
[1:29:11] commission but it was on the same night
[1:29:14] that Israel has a peace treaty and she's
[1:29:17] put back in her hom land now this has
[1:29:19] just been going on this has just been
[1:29:21] going on but it happened to be that the
[1:29:23] same night
[1:29:24] that the Gentile bride was receiving a
[1:29:26] commission to only believe but it was
[1:29:30] the same not it was the same not that
[1:29:32] the Jews were literally good put back in
[1:29:35] their
[1:29:36] position you remember when brother
[1:29:38] randam is he's there and and that Louis
[1:29:40] petus he he sees the the sign of the
[1:29:43] Messiah he sees he sees the inside on
[1:29:46] what on William brandom's life and he he
[1:29:48] tells him said that he said I've got a
[1:29:50] million books and he he he said I've got
[1:29:52] a million Bibles and we're shipping them
[1:29:54] over and William brandham is making his
[1:29:56] way back to Israel he's making his way
[1:29:58] to Israel and he's he's there in Cairo
[1:30:00] Egypt and he's there in the airport and
[1:30:02] brother Ram is standing there and the
[1:30:05] spirit of God the spirit of God stops
[1:30:07] him because a Jew will recognize a sign
[1:30:10] of a prophet and brother brandham
[1:30:12] realized that his ministry was not just
[1:30:14] an ordinary Ministry but it was a
[1:30:16] Ministry for a dispensational change and
[1:30:20] there he he goes and he's got this
[1:30:21] yearning to go and to and to preach the
[1:30:24] message he was going to preach the same
[1:30:26] message that you heard but he was going
[1:30:28] to preach it right to them Jewish people
[1:30:30] but the spirit of God speaks to him and
[1:30:32] tells him it's not their time yet you
[1:30:35] see because Elijah was on the scene but
[1:30:37] there's got to be a Moses that'll be on
[1:30:39] that scene and to think that the Jews
[1:30:41] were blinded so that you and I could
[1:30:44] have our eyesight it's the day and age
[1:30:47] where there's got to be a spiritual
[1:30:49] eyesight to be able to look into the
[1:30:51] Realms of the holies of holies you see
[1:30:54] when brother bham is standing there and
[1:30:56] recognizing or Christ is recognized in
[1:30:58] his own word brother bham begins to lay
[1:31:01] out the characteristics of the body that
[1:31:03] here the body the body has a hand the
[1:31:06] body has a feet the body has a mouth but
[1:31:09] the body has an eye and he comes up to
[1:31:11] it he said now your hand can't see for
[1:31:13] you and your feet can't see for you he
[1:31:15] said and your mouth can't see for you he
[1:31:18] said but this is the age of the eye
[1:31:21] again where you're able to be able to
[1:31:23] see he he said now you don't get any
[1:31:25] higher intelligence than that of player
[1:31:27] he said you can't get no higher to the
[1:31:29] Realms of your flesh than the eye he
[1:31:31] said the very next thing that is to come
[1:31:34] is the
[1:31:35] intelligence he said that's the reason
[1:31:37] why people now notice if you want to
[1:31:39] profit you bald Brothers he said if you
[1:31:41] want to if you want a prophet's words
[1:31:43] brother random said that's why that men
[1:31:44] go bald sooner than other he said
[1:31:47] because he said sooner than later he
[1:31:49] said because he said there's no muscle
[1:31:51] up there to to actually make make the
[1:31:54] hair follicles stay in their position so
[1:31:57] they turn loose it's a mystery it's a
[1:31:59] paradox how them
[1:32:01] Sisters still got their hair maybe maybe
[1:32:04] they got more muscles up there than
[1:32:07] we but what it brother manam said he
[1:32:10] said now notice he said the next thing
[1:32:12] from the eyesight is the intelligence he
[1:32:15] said now you can't get no higher than
[1:32:17] that eyesight he said so it takes he
[1:32:20] said it takes an eyesight to be able to
[1:32:22] see where you're living at notice what
[1:32:24] Paul tells the church in 2 Corinthians
[1:32:27] 4:18 he said it's not that it's not that
[1:32:30] we he said with this temporal things
[1:32:32] that we see these temporal things that
[1:32:34] we see he said they're temporal he said
[1:32:37] but the things that we don't see are
[1:32:40] Eternal the things we don't see are
[1:32:42] Eternal and maybe you don't see your
[1:32:44] Revival in the room maybe you don't see
[1:32:47] where your Revival's coming from but
[1:32:49] your Revival is right here
[1:32:54] maybe you don't understand where exactly
[1:32:56] the power of God is coming from to bless
[1:32:58] you in your position that you're in and
[1:33:01] maybe maybe every single one of us could
[1:33:03] say that we go through a spot that we
[1:33:06] need a fresh Revival that we need a
[1:33:08] fresh Revival I would say that we could
[1:33:10] all say that we come to a spot where we
[1:33:12] just needed to pray again that we needed
[1:33:15] to reestablish the family altar again
[1:33:17] and get back get back to God and get
[1:33:20] back to reading the message get back to
[1:33:22] playing tapes and get back to to praying
[1:33:24] again and I promise you that if you'll
[1:33:27] start right there if you'll start in
[1:33:29] prayer if you'll start in reading your
[1:33:31] Bible then you'll see a Revival don't
[1:33:34] just pray for a Revival in church pray
[1:33:36] for a Revival in your
[1:33:38] home pray for your Revival right there
[1:33:41] in your home don't wait for your
[1:33:43] children to get here to teach them how
[1:33:45] to pray and teach them how to worship
[1:33:48] and teach them how to ask God I would
[1:33:50] say this teach them right there right
[1:33:53] there where you are and I say well you
[1:33:55] said well brother Andrew I'm fighting so
[1:33:56] many demons I'm I'm fighting this in my
[1:33:59] home I'm fighting this in my life maybe
[1:34:01] you're like Samson and you've been beat
[1:34:04] down you've done beat down a thousand
[1:34:06] Philistines and you're needing a
[1:34:08] refreshing from the Lord but I want you
[1:34:10] to I want to tell you this don't throw
[1:34:12] away the best thing that God has given
[1:34:14] you don't be like Samson and say God
[1:34:17] don't leave me out here in my trial
[1:34:19] don't leave me out here in my crisis
[1:34:21] don't leave me right here but refresh me
[1:34:25] are you going to sit here and let me
[1:34:26] destroy my enemies and let me die right
[1:34:29] here give me a refreshing and the thing
[1:34:32] that Samson used to defeat his enemy was
[1:34:36] the same thing that God give him to give
[1:34:40] him a
[1:34:41] refreshing if you go to studying out
[1:34:43] genes or uh you begin to study out
[1:34:46] judges 15 excuse me I'm I'm just I'm
[1:34:48] just going by inspiration here I believe
[1:34:51] it's judges 15 that that even Samson
[1:34:54] called the name of that place in haakor
[1:34:58] which means one that called upon
[1:35:01] God one that called upon God in haakor
[1:35:05] which is near Lehi according according
[1:35:07] to scripture in haakor means one that
[1:35:10] calls on God David would say when I get
[1:35:13] nigh when I when I'm in fear or when I'm
[1:35:16] in trouble all I had to do was call upon
[1:35:18] the Lord I'll say this to you it doesn't
[1:35:21] matter the crisis it doesn't matter the
[1:35:23] trial you don't have to live in a mental
[1:35:26] state where Satan can whip you around
[1:35:28] and think that's all you've got to live
[1:35:30] in I I just want to say that Satan is a
[1:35:34] liar that Satan is a liar you can live
[1:35:38] higher than what Satan is telling you
[1:35:40] you can go further in the presence of
[1:35:42] God than Satan is telling
[1:35:47] you hallelujah it's seeing time it's
[1:35:51] seeing time and every the brother
[1:35:54] Brandon would say that every time a
[1:35:56] fresh Revival would come it was when men
[1:35:58] and when men would get back to the word
[1:36:01] of God it would be when men and women
[1:36:05] get back to the word of God and you know
[1:36:07] good and well that you've received a
[1:36:09] restored word in this hour and William
[1:36:11] brandham would stand there in 1962 and
[1:36:14] he would preach a powerful message I I
[1:36:15] love how brother brandham did that he
[1:36:17] goes after brother Neville preaches a
[1:36:19] powerful message that morning and he
[1:36:21] says I went home and I wrote down a few
[1:36:23] notes and he comes back and preaches a
[1:36:25] three and 1 half hour sermon on the
[1:36:27] restoration of the brid tree that's when
[1:36:30] you know that there's an angel that is
[1:36:31] leading you by scriptures when you can
[1:36:34] just take a few notes but there brother
[1:36:36] random say some very powerful things he
[1:36:38] said now notice he said you and I have
[1:36:41] been given the privilege to enforce our
[1:36:44] claims on Satan that if Satan has stolen
[1:36:48] something from you you have a right to
[1:36:51] enforce the claims let me say it like
[1:36:54] this that if I was in trouble and
[1:36:56] somebody was robbing my house all I have
[1:36:59] to do is call on Gabriel and the men
[1:37:01] that he works for and somebody that has
[1:37:04] the a commission that somebody's got a
[1:37:07] seal upon their life that that man can
[1:37:10] show up at my house and he has a right
[1:37:13] to enforce a claim not just by hillbilly
[1:37:16] claims not just by hillbilly laws but by
[1:37:19] the claims of the state of Virginia he
[1:37:21] can have a privilege to to cast that man
[1:37:24] into
[1:37:26] prison and Satan has come into your life
[1:37:29] to steal to kill and destroy he's stolen
[1:37:33] away your joy he's stolen away your
[1:37:35] peace he's stolen away your worship he's
[1:37:38] stolen away your family atmosphere he's
[1:37:40] stolen away your
[1:37:42] courage Hallelujah but a prophet didn't
[1:37:45] just send us a word and just leave us
[1:37:47] halfway restored he sent us a restored
[1:37:50] word a restored word a rest stored word
[1:37:54] and you as a Believer how many believers
[1:37:57] do we have here tonight it is your
[1:37:59] privilege to enforce the claims upon
[1:38:01] Satan and say Satan give it
[1:38:05] back you do not have to be you do not
[1:38:09] have to be a critic or you don't have to
[1:38:11] be a you don't have to be somebody that
[1:38:14] falls that falls under the falls under
[1:38:16] the crushing power of Satan you don't
[1:38:19] have to be the victim you might have
[1:38:22] trials you might have trials and you
[1:38:25] might have tribulations that come but
[1:38:27] you don't have to be a victim to it in
[1:38:30] the other hand you can be a
[1:38:32] Victor because God is going to raise up
[1:38:35] a people that that refuse to retreat
[1:38:38] they refuse to give in God is going to
[1:38:41] have a people that have been restored
[1:38:44] back that have been turned
[1:38:48] back
[1:38:51] Hallelujah what's Satan stolen from from
[1:38:54] you if he's stolen away your prayer life
[1:38:57] take it back if he's stolen away your
[1:38:59] joy take it back if he's stolen away
[1:39:02] your peace take it back if he's stolen
[1:39:05] away your family take it back if he's
[1:39:07] stolen away your breakthrough take it
[1:39:14] back I just feel to say those things
[1:39:16] tonight those ain't in my notes I just
[1:39:19] fa to say those things
[1:39:21] tonight I was I was was real I was real
[1:39:26] concerned I was real concerned exactly
[1:39:29] how the path of God would lead me but I
[1:39:31] I feel really I feel really pushed to
[1:39:34] say those things that God is coming to
[1:39:36] us as the rain not just a former rain
[1:39:39] which is a teaching rain but he's come
[1:39:41] unto us as a harvest rain which William
[1:39:44] Brandon would say is rapturing Faith you
[1:39:47] see now notice notice in the days of
[1:39:49] Noah in the days of Noah then then in
[1:39:52] those days you see there was in those
[1:39:54] days the water would come forth from the
[1:39:56] ground the water would come for the
[1:39:58] ground and it would water the plants it
[1:40:00] would water the ters and tomatoes and
[1:40:02] green beans and all those things but
[1:40:04] after Noah's commission and after his
[1:40:06] dispensation God was going to rain down
[1:40:08] he was going to rain and there he would
[1:40:11] be the source of those plants life and
[1:40:14] brother random would take us brother
[1:40:16] random would take us in broken cens out
[1:40:18] of Jeremiah 2:3 he said not give it give
[1:40:21] it to me there sister sister Stephanie
[1:40:24] God bless you for my people have
[1:40:25] committed two evils they have forsaken
[1:40:28] me they have forsaken me The Fountains
[1:40:31] of Living Waters and hewed them out
[1:40:33] sists broken sists that can hold no
[1:40:35] water and the prophet would take a very
[1:40:37] powerful thought on broken cister and in
[1:40:40] there brother brandom said now he said
[1:40:42] that sister he said he said it's okay he
[1:40:45] said but in there it's got It's got
[1:40:46] wiggle Tails he said that cister is
[1:40:49] depending on local rains you see if it
[1:40:52] don't get no rain
[1:40:53] if you got a sister right now living in
[1:40:55] a drought that we're living in you're
[1:40:57] living in a troubled time but if you've
[1:40:59] got a if you got a hold of a something a
[1:41:01] little bit better than artisian
[1:41:03] whale you see that sist is drawing from
[1:41:06] a Revival maybe from last year's Revival
[1:41:09] maybe from two years a labor day or
[1:41:11] maybe from this brother coming by or
[1:41:13] that evangelist coming by a sistern is
[1:41:15] depending upon local rigns but that
[1:41:18] Arian whale it's depending on a resource
[1:41:22] it's depending on a resource that's
[1:41:24] coming from a fountain that maybe he
[1:41:27] don't see maybe he don't understand it
[1:41:30] maybe he don't understand the pull of
[1:41:31] the message but something is pulling at
[1:41:34] him it's pulling at him and it's drawing
[1:41:37] at him to come
[1:41:40] up what is it it's a
[1:41:43] resource now if I if I it's okay if I
[1:41:47] preach from inspiration just for a
[1:41:48] minute if I would take this which is a
[1:41:51] source right this is a source and the
[1:41:53] Bible tells us that Jesus Jesus had the
[1:41:56] spirit without measur it's John chapter
[1:41:59] 3 that Jesus had the spirit without
[1:42:02] measuring and the prophet would teach us
[1:42:04] he would tell us he said now you and I
[1:42:06] have the spirit with measuring he said
[1:42:08] but if you go down to the ocean and you
[1:42:10] take a teaspoon out of that ocean he
[1:42:13] said you take it and you test those
[1:42:14] chemicals it's the same Source it's the
[1:42:17] same power that's there that's there in
[1:42:19] that ocean is the same thing in that
[1:42:21] teaspoon and I could take this water out
[1:42:24] of this source and if I had a cup I
[1:42:26] could pour Noah a little bit of this
[1:42:27] water and if I gave you a cup I could
[1:42:29] pour you a little bit of this water and
[1:42:31] if I gave Jay a little bit of this water
[1:42:33] they would all say that they receive
[1:42:35] something they have a resource from a
[1:42:39] source they have a resource from a
[1:42:43] source and maybe you don't understand
[1:42:46] why you feel the pole to live this
[1:42:48] message like never before but I want you
[1:42:50] to tell I want to tell you keep on
[1:42:52] drinking
[1:42:53] keep on drinking this water it's your
[1:42:56] resource of life it's sustaining if it
[1:42:59] met a woman at a whale it's that kind of
[1:43:02] water that'll make you it'll make it'll
[1:43:04] put on the inside of you Living
[1:43:07] Waters it's amazing if Noah gets to
[1:43:10] drinking that water that I gave him and
[1:43:13] he goes to telling somebody you know
[1:43:15] what I don't have the same holy ghost
[1:43:17] that brother Andrew
[1:43:19] has or if brother Jordan starts saying I
[1:43:22] don't have the same source as brother
[1:43:24] Andrew has or Brother Jay says I don't
[1:43:26] have the same source as brother Andrew
[1:43:28] has you see there's a lot of people that
[1:43:30] go around and say well I don't have the
[1:43:32] same power that the preacher has the
[1:43:35] same holy ghost that I got is the same
[1:43:38] holy ghost that you got you see I've
[1:43:40] been drinking from the same well from
[1:43:42] the same Fountain some the same
[1:43:45] anointing come on somebody come on
[1:43:48] somebody the same anointing that gave
[1:43:51] Noah water was a same anointing that led
[1:43:54] him go across the Judgment Waters the
[1:43:57] same power that gave Moses the power to
[1:44:00] stretch forth his Rod stretch forth his
[1:44:03] rod and walk over on dry ground was the
[1:44:05] same power that anointed Jesus to walk
[1:44:08] over on the waters and get to Peter the
[1:44:11] same power Hallelujah that was there in
[1:44:14] the lines then with Daniel was the same
[1:44:17] power that kept Paul and Silas in the
[1:44:20] prison cell the same power
[1:44:24] the same power that said Joshua tell the
[1:44:27] son to stand still was the same power
[1:44:30] Hallelujah was the same power that that
[1:44:33] little old woman reached out and touched
[1:44:36] him it was the same power because he had
[1:44:39] a hold of the same
[1:44:41] resource I tell you the same power that
[1:44:43] anointed non to dip down into the waters
[1:44:46] seven times was the same power that that
[1:44:49] leper grabbed a hold of Jesus and Jesus
[1:44:51] looked on him and said be thou
[1:44:54] clean it was the same power I'll tell
[1:44:58] you the same power that anointed Elijah
[1:45:01] to go up there and withstand 850 false
[1:45:04] prophets was the same power that gave
[1:45:06] Jesus the power to withstand the
[1:45:08] religious worlds of that
[1:45:11] day I'm going somewhere and don't even
[1:45:13] know where I'm going but I'm preaching
[1:45:15] to you just for a minute I say it like
[1:45:16] this the same power that fell on the day
[1:45:19] of
[1:45:21] Pentecost you don't have to want about
[1:45:23] the about the Holy Ghost that Paul had
[1:45:26] and the holy ghost that Peter had and
[1:45:28] the holy ghost that William brandham had
[1:45:30] that same
[1:45:31] power is a power that's falling on the
[1:45:34] Church of the Living
[1:45:38] God and you have a privilege you have a
[1:45:41] privilege to take your power and return
[1:45:44] back to the Lord because Satan can't get
[1:45:47] a hold of that little life that's laying
[1:45:48] on the inside of you
[1:45:54] that's the same power you said well when
[1:45:57] do I know if it's time for me to go up
[1:45:59] and take my privilege and enforce the
[1:46:01] claim David David one day he was waiting
[1:46:05] to see when his time was he was waiting
[1:46:07] on his time brother Isaiah he was
[1:46:09] waiting to see if it was the time of the
[1:46:10] lord and there he got underneath him
[1:46:12] mberry
[1:46:14] trees he got underneath him mberry trees
[1:46:17] and you might be wondering is this a
[1:46:18] service that you drive out Satan is this
[1:46:21] the service that you really receive a
[1:46:22] break through is this a service that you
[1:46:24] get a hold of something is this a
[1:46:26] service that you receive A Change Is it
[1:46:28] is it time is it time is it time is it
[1:46:33] time I say you're in the midst of
[1:46:36] it oh and David was seeking out the mind
[1:46:39] of God he was seeking out the mind of
[1:46:42] God whether whether he should go up at
[1:46:44] this time or go up at another time but
[1:46:46] the Lord said unto him it's time to go
[1:46:48] now when the Angels over top the mberry
[1:46:51] trees and David said I heard the sound
[1:46:54] of a
[1:46:55] going what was it it was a sign unto him
[1:46:58] that it was time to
[1:47:00] go and you may have been living here you
[1:47:02] may have been living with the
[1:47:04] devil you may have been living with
[1:47:06] trouble you may have been living with
[1:47:08] sin but I want to tell you right now is
[1:47:10] a
[1:47:11] time right now is a time you are perfect
[1:47:15] in the sight of almighty God and the
[1:47:18] only thing that is stopping you from
[1:47:20] removing Satan out of your life is
[1:47:22] unbelief
[1:47:23] the only thing that is keeping you from
[1:47:25] moving Satan out of his position is
[1:47:28] unbelief but if you could just let that
[1:47:30] little flame of fire gets a whirling up
[1:47:32] on the inside of you and said Lord I
[1:47:34] believe it now Faith is the substance of
[1:47:38] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:47:40] not
[1:47:41] seen our God is a rewarder of them that
[1:47:44] diligently seek
[1:47:45] Him and if you could turn loose your
[1:47:48] faith just real quick come on Mary I'll
[1:47:50] say even now even now now even now it's
[1:47:54] time it's time it's time you let loose
[1:47:57] of
[1:47:59] it you can either be traumatized by your
[1:48:03] trial you can either be traumatized by
[1:48:05] your trial or you can traumatize your
[1:48:12] trial you can either go along with the
[1:48:14] Mind
[1:48:15] battles or you can battle your
[1:48:18] mind let me ask you
[1:48:21] something how big would you dream if you
[1:48:25] couldn't if you knew you couldn't
[1:48:27] fail how big would you ask if you knew
[1:48:30] you wouldn't get the answer
[1:48:32] no how
[1:48:34] big how big would you ask if God's
[1:48:38] answer was yes how big would you dream
[1:48:41] if you knew you couldn't fail well
[1:48:43] little bride I want to tell this unto
[1:48:45] you this is a church that is a
[1:48:48] continuation of the book of Acts
[1:48:54] you are an invincible Army that means
[1:48:57] you are too powerful to be
[1:49:04] defeated
[1:49:09] hallelujah what you going to ask
[1:49:12] for you're in the midst of the greatest
[1:49:14] Revival that's ever struck the face of
[1:49:16] the
[1:49:17] Earth what are you going to do with it
[1:49:20] what are you going to do with your
[1:49:21] Mountain are you going to be like clay
[1:49:23] Caleb and say give me my Mountain are
[1:49:27] you going to let some Amorite inhabit
[1:49:29] your inheritance the rest of your
[1:49:31] life you see as long as it's a promise
[1:49:35] it's just something out there in front
[1:49:36] of you but if it's a
[1:49:38] possession then you can say it is my
[1:49:41] inheritance and I'll say this at Malachi
[1:49:45] 4 Malachi 4 came and pointed out your
[1:49:50] inheritance so this is your
[1:49:53] this is yours this is yours brother
[1:49:56] Maron would talk about the
[1:49:57] fundamentalist in the
[1:49:59] Pentecostal he said if I could ever get
[1:50:01] them two hooked up together one's got
[1:50:04] faith and he said the other one's got

[1:54:41] you think everybody understands what
[1:54:42] you're
[1:54:44] saying you think everybody's on the same

[1:55:04] tell you what I I was on fire I was as
[1:55:07] much on fire then as I am right
[1:55:10] now and I got to talking about how
[1:55:12] powerful God was doing things that he
[1:55:14] was saving this one I wasn't just
[1:55:15] telling our stories I was telling the
[1:55:16] stories
[1:55:17] any I tell you one thing as as long as
[1:55:20] I'm alive God's going to have a witness
[1:55:21] and
[1:55:23] I don't care if it happens to me I I'd
[1:55:24] much rather I'd much rather tell your
[1:55:26] story brother Timothy than to tell mine
[1:55:28] but if if if if God ain't doing nothing
[1:55:30] else I'll tell my story I'll tell my
[1:55:32] story and I I started telling this I I
[1:55:36] started telling this used to be message
[1:55:37] preacher that walked away from it I
[1:55:39] started telling him about the Revival
[1:55:41] that was taking place I started telling
[1:55:42] him about this brother I start started
[1:55:44] telling about this healing I I said man
[1:55:45] this is It's a bride's Revival this is
[1:55:47] everything that we have believed on and
[1:55:50] waited on and it's here where in the
[1:55:52] morning moments of it and and we're
[1:55:53] seeing it and he said no it's just a
[1:55:55] season you watch I've been a pastor for
[1:55:58] I've been a pastor for 40 years now and
[1:56:00] I watch those times come and I watch
[1:56:02] those times cease I watch them come
[1:56:04] again and I watch them cease he said

[1:56:11] gone and I've been in the same
[1:56:14] Revival I've been in the same Revival
[1:56:17] for 20 years now almost 20 years now and
[1:56:20] it ain't left me one time cuz I tell you
[1:56:22] it's kind of like that little stream
[1:56:24] that brother Brandon would talk about
[1:56:26] what makes you so happy let me tell you
[1:56:28] church let me tell you Church coming to
[1:56:31] church is one of the greatest things I
[1:56:32] ever done in my life but it didn't start
[1:56:35] here it started in my truck it started
[1:56:39] in my house it started beside my
[1:56:43] bed I've been drinking from my Fountain
[1:56:46] and ain't running dry let me tell you
[1:56:48] there is unlimited resource on it
[1:56:53] Hallelujah I was reading a little bit of
[1:56:55] article and I promise you I'm done I I
[1:56:57] promise you I'm done cuz I ain't even I
[1:56:58] ain't even preach my
[1:57:00] message I ain't preaching my message I'm
[1:57:02] just preaching by inspiration I hope
[1:57:03] you're okay with that tonight but that's
[1:57:05] that's
[1:57:13] honestly I was reading a little I was
[1:57:15] reading a
[1:57:17] article that
[1:57:19] the that the Earth pulls on 40 million
[1:57:24] metric tons of water every
[1:57:29] year pulls on 40 metric tons of water
[1:57:33] every
[1:57:35] year and job
[1:57:37] said that God hangs the world on
[1:57:43] nothing now that's it's like 14
[1:57:47] quadrillion trillions and 18 zeros
[1:57:50] behind it
[1:57:53] I don't know if that's exactly right ask
[1:57:55] one of these teachers they'll probably
[1:57:56] be able to tell
[1:57:58] you but job said God hangs the world on
[1:58:01] nothing and it takes on 40 metric tons
[1:58:05] of water every
[1:58:06] year and he hangs it on
[1:58:09] nothing surely he can take
[1:58:12] you and he control your little
[1:58:15] world it can control your crisis
[1:58:23] he can control your
[1:58:25] problems God bless
[1:58:28] you God bless
[1:58:31] you
[1:58:42] hallelujah how big is your problem and
[1:58:45] how big are you going to
[1:58:48] ask you're drinking from the same source
[1:58:50] that I'm drinking from you're drinking
[1:58:52] from the same power that I'm drinking
[1:58:54] from and I
[1:58:56] believe maybe if you don't believe maybe
[1:58:59] you can take my faith just for a
[1:59:02] minute I believe for
[1:59:04] you I believe that all things are
[1:59:07] possible I believe that if you're
[1:59:09] wanting to see a miracle and maybe you
[1:59:11] ain't got the faith to attain it just
[1:59:13] yet take my
[1:59:15] faith take my
[1:59:18] faith take the right mental attitude
[1:59:20] towards any God's promises
[1:59:23] and he'll bring it to
[1:59:24] pass let the musicians
