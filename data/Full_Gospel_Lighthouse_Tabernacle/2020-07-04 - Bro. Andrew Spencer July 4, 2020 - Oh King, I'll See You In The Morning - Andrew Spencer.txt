us god bless you so thankful to have you here in the house of the Lord we greet you today in the name of the Lord we we have been on a little excursion this week and we went to Louisiana some of you may have already seen that service but we didn't know if we were going to be able to do it and that's why we didn't relay the message to you all last weekend and things were still up in the air but God so ordained us to be in those and those this week just to be at brother Tim's and to be there to hold their hands and prayer and them to hold us up in prayer and and it was a very very supernatural week and just to be able for our pastor to be able to make that trip was a miracle and I can assure you that he was in good hands I took very good care of him watched over him protected him fed him good and and so but we had a wonderful trip and so many things that they could be said and and maybe I'll relay some of those things later and our services evening but just to see the angel of the Lord moving and and that's what I want you as a congregation to watch for and to be attentive and be conscious of is the moving of that angel that when he begins to trouble the water that's that's the time to step in when I when I witnessed three young boys received the baptism of the holy ghost in a little cabin I can tell you God will come to you and your pew he'll come to you and your car he'll come to you wherever you are he's that kind of a garden and be very attentive to him and beware of him and obey Him and and just just the things of God that have happened we cannot thank him enough we are celebrating our independence as a nation today and as the kingdom of heaven we are celebrating our freedom there is no freedom like the freedom that is in Christ Jesus there there will be fireworks set off all over the nation today but there's nothing like the fireworks that's happened in my soul where he changed me and made me a new creation and I cannot thank him enough for all the Freedom and the Liberty that is in Christ and whom the Sun is set free is free indeed are you free this evening they may praise the name just just one announcement or here please announce that tonight after church sister Lisa and sister Joanne have a small gift for all the sisters 18 years of age or older 18 years of age and older for the sisters all right I'm blessed yelling that also want to make mention to you again as you have been doing as you coming in entering and exiting make sure you're wearing your mask when you're taking up the tithes and offerings and passing one another please wear your mask they are saying that the numbers are rising and we just want to be attentive of those sayings and want to protect you as a people and remind you for no gathering before or after service and I know that that puts a little bit of damper on our fellowship a little bit but we're just we want to be able to continue to have service the way we're having service and not go back to the halves or to the ten and so if you can please please do those things for us I thank you for being so cooperative and if Costco makes you be cooperative and you do those things I think you'd be able to do the things for the Lord and a man won't you stand with us this evening them maybe we sing that song hear my prayer O Lord before we go to the word [Music] you're into the earth [Music] [Applause] [Music] and the shelter of your weeds for tops of trouble what's turned over to Daniel chapter 6 and verse 4 and if if you have had a chance to listen to the service there in Louisiana how many had a chance to listen to that good number of you Amen well tonight I'm going to follow that thought and so you'll hear some of those things again so you'll know where to say a man that but I am under a strict mandate to say these things tonight so so I I'm going to do you just give me a little bit of Liberty here tonight and you just you just allow him to come close to you if he's put me under a mandate by the leadership here to to speak these things he's got something for you so I want you to be very attentive and and be ever listening and watching and when he comes I don't care how he comes just lift your hand lift your voice lift your faith and just reach out and touch him he's got a need he's got a need to come by your way this evening and so just reach out and touch him so by the help of the Lord I'd like to speak to you tonight Oh King I will see you in the morning okay now see you in the morning Daniel chapter 6 and verse 4 then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion nor fault for as much as he was faithful neither was there any error or fall found in him then said these men we shall not find any occasion against this Daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his God then these presidents and princes assemble together to the king and said thus unto him King Darius live forever all the presidents of the kingdom the governors and the princes the councilors and the captains have consulted together to establish a royal statue and to make a firm decree that whosoever shall ask petition of any kind any God or man for 30 days save of thee O king he shall be cast into the den of lions now O King established the decree and Sandow writing that it be not changed according to the law of the Medes and the Persians which all truth not wherefore King Darius signed the writing and the decree now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being opened in his chamber towards Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did a four time how many has a need that you'd like to take before the Lord this evening amen God sees your hand he sees your need Heavenly Father we approach your throne of mercy just now Lord with the spirit of humility largest flowing from our hearts Lord knowing that you are the author and the finisher of our faith father Lord we know that you are here to do and here to work amongst your people and minister to them like a never before Lord you see the hands that have been lifted up you see the heart that is below that hand Lord that has a need that that only you can meet now father we know that you are able to speak live to hear to your children we've give many times a witness of the things that have been said from this pulpit Lord that have spoke directly to hearts and miracles happen and miracles take place and life's be transformed and changed Lord you see the newborn babes in Christ how that how that they have came to water see now I pray Lord Jesus that you would be mindful of the youngest child to the oldest here tonight that you would speak to them on their level in which they would receive and attach themselves to father we pray God that you would go across this audience Lord and may they begin to feel that pulsation of the Holy Ghost as you begin to draw ever so near father Lord we know that that that your word you your word you follow that word if your Holy Spirit and and if a heart can receive that word then they have the conductor as it leads the way and may the Holy Ghost go to their situation and go to their hearts door and minister to them my life peace and health I pray all of these things for your name and in your name in the name of Jesus Christ amen may God bless his word he may be seated also in Daniel chapter 6 and verse 16 then the king commanded and they brought Daniel and cast him into the den of lions now the King spake and said unto Daniel now notice notice these statements now this what you see from where we left off in verse 10 and from the time that Daniel was thrown into the Lions Den that Daniel does not open his mouth except for the prey under his god but notice what the king there is a connection between the king and Daniel and Dan and the King spake and said unto Daniel thy God whom now service continually he will deliver thee so so we realized that even the King knew how powerful that the God of heaven was and that he was on the side of Daniel you see it makes a statement to us as we're looking at this in this in this condition that Daniel was in and we look and we see that that God had a testimony and that God had a witness there and notice verse 17 and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the King sealed it with his own signet and with the Signet of his lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning that yo now I want you to just kind of imagine these things in your mindset and come to get them in your mind has this has this cave has been set as there are there are lions that are in this den may some historians say from anywhere to seven to ten lions are there and they would feed them depending on what they would feed them whether they would feed them sheep or goats or or whatever they would feed them up to ten sheep a day this this den of lions and and what they would do when they were bringing men into that den of lions they would they would starve them so that as soon as that man would fall into that cave or that or that being or whatever they were throw in there would devour them and break their bones and if they didn't immediately go and kill them they would go and break their bones and let them suffer and then they would go back and had kill off their kill off their their their their their enemy or the person that was in that cave so you can imagine the fear that is going along with the Lions Den now I have to say that none of us sitting here has ever been through a moment like that now if you've been over in the jungles they say that that lion when he begins to roar that he can roll rocks off of a hill miles and miles away that Lions voice has the power to shut everything up in the entire jungle so you can imagine when you put seven to ten lines the fear that it would cause as you're getting ready to be dropped into a cave now one would be enough to scare me but a whole dinner of lions would set the precedence of fear but yet Daniel was a man than God that God trusted he was a man that trusted God and I believe that it's been spoken that if you trust me I'll use you like never before and Daniel was put into a condition of life that would bring him to a spot where he would be recognized but before you can be recognized as a guy as a man that has that has withstood the Lions then you got to go through the lines then and before you can be recognized as a man that kills a dime you got to go into a valley and before you can go and you can preach down to you can go and preach the people about a God that is that is coming to you for repentance you've got to be able to go through through the through the belly of a whale and be able to come out on the other side and be able to testify that I'm a witness I'm a witness of the power of prayer I'm a witness that God does not change I'm a witness that God is ever-present I'm a witness that God still works through humanity you see that is the program of God to be able to walk through humanity and he's looking for one tonight he's looking for children he's looking for mothers he's looking for fathers you see God works through human beings to redeem human beings he can take you and work through you to redeem humanity if you completely dedicate everything that you are if you're a young woman dedicate your morals if you're a young man dedicate your morals dedicate your mind dedicate your thinking dedicate your heart dedicate your soul dedicate all that you are and let Christ's work through you let Christ's work through that what a glorious thing when you can dedicate your whole entire being and God works through you and ministers through you and their Daniel was living in such a spot that that you have to realize the condition that Daniel was here Daniel was living in a city he was living in a land where he was not that we would not call home he was in a spot of captivity when the children of God had been taken away and put in the city of Babylon but Daniel was a man that had purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's meat in the King Street you see Daniel was a man of God that trusted God as a young man as he's brought all the way up through different Kings and through different leaders who watched Daniel's life and here Daniel is about 70 years old when we're grabbing ahold of his story and Daniel at this age knew and had seen the power of God and at that age Daniel was not willing to back off what God had said how about you children of God that have been here the hand of God you sing the power of God it's too late to draw back it's too late to back up it's too late to give in we've already seen what he can do surely hallelujah surely I'm not going to turn around now and I'm not going to back off what God is head nor what I am going to believe that God can do but you see that man Daniel was a real seed of Abraham living in that land that was different living amongst people that were different but yet he was gallant to that promise that I'll not deflower myself with the Kings meat and the Bible says it tells us if you look over in Daniel chapter one that you can find that that Daniel was preferred above all the other princes and the presidents and the Bible said that Daniel was excellent in spirit and excellent spirit was in him and you see in the spot of condition of darkness light shines its best so you see you could take and you could take and you can look at that light and you could put that light in the middle of darkness and there's no darkness around and the Bible said in Daniel chapter one that the Bible said that he was ten times more wiser than all of the other men Daniel was excellent in spirit I think it's amazing that that the enemy of hell would look out upon the children of God and they would see that there's none like that one there they're more wise than all of the denominations are more wise than all of the kree's that one person is ten more ten more times more wise in all of the ideologies and the Creed's and the things of man that one man is so filled with the Holy Ghost that he's accent in spirit whoo here you in our we live in a land that's different he's saying our whole we're just a passing through right here this ain't my home I am in making a trip I've been making investments I've been making my I've been making a declaration that I'm leaving here one of these days I'm going on vacation and I'm staying on vacation hallelujah hallelujah when I go on that vacation I'm not looking for a tan and I'm not looking like hell I'm gonna come back different but I'm going on that side of that vacation and I'm going to a place when I'll never get old I'll never get frail I'll never get weak I'll never get tired I'll never get sick hallelujah I'm going to a place it's better than the beach it's better than Disneyland I'm going to a land that has been built by the maker of heaven and of art hallelujah here we are this is the darkest of days and the darkest of hours it's a day when no man else when no man has ever went through what you're going through but this is the hour of overcomers this is the hour when we shine our best we know that when you run a relay race that you put in your best and that last so you can look at yourself and you can get all tore up but you can look at the end of the day say look I'm the best that God's got there's a lot of people that'll let you down but God won't let you down and if you're the best that God's got to come through lay on us here he's got faith in you that you're coming out on the other side by the lion stand hallelujah you see overcomers are those that are faithful and obedient Christians who not only talk about doing the will of God but who actually do it and you look at revelations chapter 2 and revelations chapter 3 when Jesus is speaking to John about the church ages and here it speaks extensively of the overcomers and it is to those overcomers that the blessings of the future Kingdom are promised to you can look at you to see that they will be clothed in white they will be pillars in the Lord's temple they will be granted power over the nation's they will enjoy the tree of life they will not be subject to spiritual their names will be acknowledged by Christ they will be fed out of that hidden man they will have our white stone with their name on it Christ will write his own name upon them and they will set with Christ on his soul that is the throne of the overcomer is to set with Christ whoo and notice what the Prophet said in the Laodicean Church as he said now then there will not be one person who was set in that throne of the Lord Jesus unless he has been living that word your prayers your fasting to repentance no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that throne it will be granted only to the word broad as the throne of the king is shared with the Queen because she is United to him so only they who are of that Lord even as he is of that word will share that throne so if you're going to sit in that seat you've got to be a part of that word you've got to share in that word you've got to be a part of that word you've got to eat that word and when you look at the things that the overcomer has to overcome and the things that the body of Christ is going through and to see that the things out weary we get so come discombobulated about we get so tore up well how's this gonna work out look at this one sick and look at that one sick God's got this it's astonishing sometimes when you take a look back and you say and you look at the drama as God is displaying it completely before you and if you are an admirer of art you can look at this great piece of art and there's not another piece in all the heart in all the halls of critics there's not another piece of art like this in all the halls of the libraries you are his that's picture he's been drawing you out before the foundation of the world and he's getting ready to stamp his name upon that picture hello Luke hello Luke you look at these things you look at what happened to God's general brother on you look at what's happened to men like brother Harold Hildebrandt you look like what has happened to men like brother ed Bisco going through heart attacks men like buy the home of Frazier and going through the battles and many things that are happening to the Pruett family and the things that are happening to the children of God you look at those things and you would get the idea that somebody hates the children of God and you would lie and Satan would like to think that he's got the upper hand cut on you and the upper hand cut on God's children and on God but I want to warn the devil we will not be put in a corner nor will be left hanging over the side of the ropes like we've been beat down and barely gonna make it when we get 10 when we go over on the other side we're gonna dance on the other side we're not going to barely crawl and get there we're going all the way completely unharmed I'm sick we are going to make it so why would we back up if we are the overcomers of Laodicea we ought to shout like never before we ought to praise like never before because we know that we are going to make it and we're going to win the only way children that you cannot win is if you switch sides I am NOT switching sides over to the devil side I'll stay with Jesus I'll go with the one that can take me out of the valley I'll go with the one that'll bring me out of the pit hallelujah why would I turn back on him now brother Vernon when I've seen him display himself and disperse himself like never before when we watched when we watch thee the greatest opening of the word that has ever taken place that that we had referee reformers throughout all the ages we had reformers that would come and men would come behind that and within three years they would denominator but there's not been one denomination set on this message men have their ideas but there's not been one denominational set on this message how can you denomination of the hour when it's the king you can't put Christ in a box that Allu you you can't even hold him in a book why should I turn around now and try to give up or try to back off of what God has said we have watched the third poll in action when you see the Holy Ghost go and grab ahold of that word and bring that word into an exact season and bring it and make it manifest when you watch that that third pull that you know what that is that it's the King sword but when you watch that King sword what does it do it produces miracles it produces life hallelujah noe no call a storm completely out of existence and we've watched this third pull in operation in the head of the tent of humanity as we watch as God has taken all human flesh again because God will not back off of his word and to think that he's using you to think that he's using you now that right there that just blade that just it makes it makes Satan so so upset that he would take you brother Steve that he would take you and he would work through you and he would redeem humanity and he would work through humanity to prove I'm the god of creation that I am the one that spoke to the winds and I spooked I am the author of life we've seen this God - I don't have it in my vocabulary we've seen him do incredible things we've seen him take things and work through you manatee just like he did 2,000 years ago we've seen the mighty God and veiled before us and you watches that seed as it's going through the body as it begins to come and it begins to move as it comes out and you're watching that it's the same who the same seed that went in the ground is the same one as risen in this hour what is it it's the word attaching itself to believers you watch us as men trying to attach themselves with this message and they can never attach himself I hope you kind of catch what I'm saying right here but you watch as that real believer he's not moved he's not shook but what does he do he begins to dig down deeper when the winds of change keep coming he just keeps digging down deeper and finding his roots and he keeps finding with God his head and he pulls up and he shows that I am the Lord and I change not that I was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities and the chastisement of my peace was upon him and by His stripes I am healed sickness can come torment can come but he begins to dig down deeper it is the Lord attaching itself to believers well notice what the prophet said in perfect faith he said when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into broad material you're getting in to rapturing hallelujah hallelujah when that man walks in substance faith that means he's got it it's real it's before him he's getting him bride material and he's getting in rapture condition what makes a difference between this church and all the other churches out there it's him it's him they preach faith they preach baptism some of them preach one God but they do not know how to live in overcoming life and the key ingredient is him you watched the story we read tonight and you watch that the angel is the one that makes the difference hallelujah it was not the difference of lines that they put down there maybe they change the lines out week to week but it was the angel that made the difference Daniel was a believer and Daniel was conscious of that angelic realm you remember when brother Lanham would stand there he would stand at that Hall at that podium and he would say now hey now I'm trying to catch your spirit and I see you and you feel that sweet spirit right now and that is that it's none other and you begin to hear his voice begin to trail off and he's breaking into another round he said now that angel the Lord is no more than two feet from me and two feet from you now don't you be afraid of that don't you be afraid of that that will hurt you that'll help you now he said now now that success that you've got its breaking him into another realm over into another category and it's breaking into that dimension and it's pulling down that promise you see that angelic realm it's right there beside you it's standing every present ever so close and if we could ever be so mindful as human beings to realize that there is a visible audience in the invisible realm to bringing us into his presence and to draw us closer to him what kind of people would we be if we acted out what the Prophet told us now he told us the angel told brother Balaam you remember he told him he said now look your words your thoughts sell louder in heaven than your words do here on earth now automatically as human beings we begin to identify and think oh my goodness what kind of thoughts have I thought this week what kind of bad thoughts and your mind begins to identify and look back through over those things as soon as a minister says those things you begin to think back is that right some of you running through your mind right now oh my goodness whoa I lost my temper and your thoughts sounding louder in heaven than your words to here on earth now a lot of people begin to think about it that way and they think oh I gotta think positive things I gotta think I got to make sure I'm not thinking negative things but what about this what if you turn the diamond this way and your thoughts of positivity and your thoughts of resurrection power and your thoughts of anointing and your thoughts are the Holy Ghost if they sell louder in heaven if your negative ones sell out in heaven how much more about your thoughts towards his promise how much more do they sound louder in heaven I'd say if your thoughts are ringing out that kind of a spiritual atmosphere it'll do something for the natural that same angels here that same angels movie I've watched him too many times come in his congregation and begin to bless people he's here he's moving and he's very active in this congregation you're a very mature people you're a very mature group in the bride of Jesus Christ and you know when the angel the Lord begins to draw near you remember Billy Paul that brother Brandon would allow a brother Brandon or brother Brandon would ask the angel if he would allow Billy Paul since he worked with him in the meetings if he would allow him to work and be see him he said I'll allow Billy but not your brother if you remember that now now Billy Paul he was there laying in the bed and brother banner went and woke brother band up Bill brother Billy and he laid a pillow over his face he said now Billy wake up the angel of the Lord is in the room that don't be afraid but I've asked him if I could have permission that you could see him and brother Branham slowly pull back that pillow and there brother Billy Paul looked and in the corner was standing the angel of the Lord and he would describe him at how everything happened and then that angel the Lord as he stood there he began to move off and that rainbow stood in that room for hours upon hours now brother Billy Paul said now he said every time I was working with dad in the prayer line he said I could tell you every single time he came you know when he comes brother Billy said now he said every time he said he would come he said if I had a toothache or something else he said every time he termed that toothache would leave and you know Turks are the Living God when the angel stands up if Full Gospel lighthouse you know when he's on the scene there is no man that can take humanity and make him do what he wants to but that angel begins to move and begins to speak and you reach out and say that's more he stood at this platform he stood by that wall he's hung over this crowd he's minister your hearts he's changed your life ain't there i brother Steven he changed your life when he

this speak lives here to you to tell you that I am the resurrection and I am the life brother al well tell us now he said now that angel of the Lord but that's not Jesus he said that's the angel of the Lord from that angelic realm he said but one night he said I was able to tell this to you by the at bothy by the leadership of the Lord I was able to say these things he said one night I was there and I was praying for my daddy he said my mama had done been baptized numbers save he said but I was praying for my daddy he you remember his daddy was a drunk he said I was praying I was praying for my daddy and he said something told me to rise up and he said I rose up and I begin to walk and I started to walk out there and in that in that that I that sage that sage field he said I walked out there and added that sagebrush field and he said I seen I seen this man standing there he said a real peaceful looking figure he said I begin to watch him and he said he was a real short man now brother Branham would tell us that the angel Lord was about six foot tall and he would stand head that olive complexion he said but Jesus was a real short man he said he looked that if you looked at him he would change the world and flip it upside down in a matter of seconds he said but I begin to sit there and I was he said I pinched myself he said I I grabbed that stage verse and he said I know now I know this innovation and I know this in a dream he said coz I was just back to the praying and he said he was sitting there looking he said the wind was blowing that sage back and forth and his white robe that garment that he had on was blowing in the wind and he said I stood there and he said I wanted to get a little better look at him he said so I begin to move myself around and he said it looked he said the closest thing I've seen is the Hoffman head of Christ that looks he said so I I tried to get his attention so that he would look this way and he said I went and he said he didn't really he didn't really change her he didn't really move he said then I said I I thought I'd call he said I thought I'd call him my name and he said Jesus he said Jesus and he said then he turned my way and looked at me to reached out his arms he reached out his arms and he said the next thing I know I said I woke up I woke up laying in that sage field completely soaking wet from tears that had run off on me that night Oh church he's ever-present don't you ever fear to go anywhere ever do anything for the never-failing presence of Jesus Christ he's with you ever ever so you go that angel of the Covenant that led the children of Israel across the Red Sea he's ever so near he's ever so near and he was the one that Daniel could speak from that statement of faith and said O king no matter what I go through I'll see you in the morning Oh what would it do if you begin to call on his name what's his name every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus that Jesus Christ is Lord give me just a little bit liberty Brother Bear said in the pillar of fire he said now in the days that he led the Israel let Israel through the wilderness I want to read some scripture I want you to notice closely God commissioning Moses to send him now over in Exodus 23 the 23rd chapter in the 20th verse he said listen closely he said behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring the end of the place which I have prepared what who the saint who is beware of him and obey his voice and provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou will indeed obey his voice and do all that I have spoke that I speak then I will be an enemy to thine enemies and an adversary to thine adversaries for my name's shall go before thee now watch what brother Anna says he said let's see what the angel look like in the thirteenth chapter of Exodus we read this in the 21st and 22nd verse and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud and to lead them by a flare a pillar and cloud in the way by night by a pillar of fire and to give them light by night and he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day neither the pillar fire by night from before the people so we see that the pillar of fire that angel was the one that was leading the children of Israel and he would tell them to beware of that angel that I'll send him before you to keep you in that way now what have we seen in this hour we have seen a return of the pillar fire what he insists that is standing amongst the children of God it's Jesus I'll tell you right now Church no matter what condition you're in the angel of the Lord is an expert of getting you out of trouble he's an expert of making away he's an expert of getting you out of prison he's an expert of setting you free he's an expert in healing he's an axe raisin expert in the way making he's that kind of an angel you remember when Herod put Peter in the prison and that night in hay Acts chapter 12 that the angel the Lord came down there when there was two prison guards on the side of Peter that the angel the Lord came and set him free that same age was here to set the children of God free from every demonic power every sickness every cancer every high blood pressure ever sugar diabetes every man problem that angel of healing is circling the camp of God [Applause] Daniel was a man that they couldn't find no fault in they were they hated him without cause because he was excellent in severe there's a lot of people that's afraid to be identified with America right now but if you're an American you're identified all the way to its core the Prophet said that I'm American through and through I'm identified with her same and I'm identified with her glory but there's another kingdom of God that I am identified with I am not ashamed of that Kingdom I am not ashamed of that word I am not ashamed of them angels I am not ashamed to my god I'm identified with men like David and men like Daniel and men like the three Hebrew children and a man like Peter and Paul and James I'm identified with a nation that cannot be shook I'm identified with a kingdom that cannot be tore down the men hate them the men hate you that's presidents that hates you there's governors that hates you Wow they are led and anointed by the demons of Hell and they hate the move of God you don't think so just allow or if I were to take place and take over the city and governors and mayors and everything will come and shut you down it's corrupt all the way to its core and they hated Daniel without a cause and they wanted to throw him into a pit that he could not get out of but what them presidents and them princes didn't know is that there was an angel that was already on his way before the lines ever got hungry hallelujah brother Bantam said that God was not finished with Daniel yet and he said before they threw him in the lion's den that was an angel hanging on that ladder before brother on went through the fire there was an angel there before Full Gospel Light House went through the fire went through the flood there's an angel there's an angel there what the community don't know and what they not understanding is that there is a mighty angel that is ever present to change the situation what is cancer what is this brain bleed to the Almighty God the devil may think he's got you baby ain't got you the devil may think he's got you in the corner oh I feel like smacking the devil right in the mouth tonight he may think he's got you give us the best you got and we're still gonna win Louis in the lines here and we come out winning put us in a valley with a job and we come out win it put us in the fire then we come out winning put us in a ranch seeing we come out winning there is a blood that takes us through Oh King I'll see you in the morning [Applause] now for you that do not know and did not hear the message let me just give this to you and I'm gonna make a part three out of this oh Jesus the reason I'm preaching to you these things with such fervency and as a leader of this church it's because I know we're gonna win the reason I can tell you that you're going to make it it's because I know there's an angel there he's guarding you he's watching over you he's protecting you if you could just release your faith just for a moment he's got your children in his hands he's got your situation in his hands is that right brother Branham said that faith perfect faith is a master of all circumstances and the circumstances that the children of God are going through is none other it you can't fight it with none other type of faith or a weak faith but perfect faith you ain't got to try to build yourself up and try to make yourself a he-man in faith it's just simple common hyssop faith that will kill the devil faith is the faucet that you turn on that releases the flow of God's blessings now to me it ain't that hard go out there and turn on that water spigot and give me a cool drink of walking summer if we could just realize that faith is that Avenue in which we allow the blessings of God to flow through brother Roy Shrewsbury lived about two and a half hours from here as a general and absolute general been through Wars but has stood like none other in this hour a real general 95 years old a real a real man of God a man of God that I remember as a little child the very first time that I ever seen the ball of fire the pillar fire it was in brother Roy Shrewsbury church and I every time every time he comes I'm reminded of that very first instance where the angel of the Lord allowed me to see him brother Roy's a real real man of God you all were very acquainted with brother Roy we've been so close and brother brother Roy we actually we borrowed each other's plans for churches and work together we've been we've been generous in this war together and brother on has ministered for brother Roy many times and when we we begin to go through this journey brother ons are very loved to human being if you haven't realized by now probably one of the most loved men throughout the whole entire world there's a lot of people that love him but I know and realized that he means a whole lot more to that side to God than what he even means to us in this room so God is for mother on just like he's for you and brother Roy called brother on several times today two times to be exact and he called him and he told him and he said he said brother on I now we cannot embellish and we cannot we have a mandate that we cannot rely on God that we cannot go off an impulse and say anything just because we want to say something because you realize as a minister of God that you're accountable for everything that you say you see you see even brother never would get in trouble and he would go into that realm and he would people wanted them to prophesy over top of him and they would get in trouble the human flesh wants to give seriously every we want to give you but no man can say unless God speaks and if it comes from that realm it's gotta be dead on it's gotta be accurate it's gotta hit the mark and brother Roy called brother on and said brother on you are about to go into a cave that no man has ever came out of you're getting ready to go into a cave that no man's ever came out of but brother on I say to you by the Spirit of the Lord you will say like Daniel said O king I see you in the morning [Applause] I'll see you in the morning Alleluia hello he said brother all you're gonna live you're coming out of cave like nobody else's came out off you're gonna live hallelujah Dan you knew what his God was capable of but when Daniel got down there that angel shut the mouths of those lions what did he do he took all of the hunger away from those lines to think about this let me give it to you like this when the thing that you're so scared about get scared of you hallelujah with tape so when the thing you hate so much it's so scared about gets so scared that the people of God when cancer gets cancer and takes its leave those lives shut their mouths the Lion of cancer shut your mouth the line of depression shut your mouth the line of suicide shut your mouth the line of depression anxiety fear all of those things shut your mouth there's an angel here stay with me I'm telling you Church there are things being released that I don't even understand why or how God is releasing things in this season like he has before but I'm telling you he is putting you in a perfect position for a body change he's putting you in a perfect position for a body change and Jesus knew every scripture that he looked at was identifying himself and this message is putting you in a perfect position from none other than the promises of God that you were given a little bit of a clip a little bit of a vision two years ago before our labor day the brother arm was going into a cave you didn't realize it but the vision had spoke that there was craters who remember there was craters that was so deep and so dark and looked like a war zone and brother Ron come and went all the way down into that pit he went all the way down into that pit and when he got to the bottom of the pit he grabbed ahold of a lamb and began to lead it right back out of that pit there has been no man and his went into that pit and ever came back out but there is a man that is coming out of that pit carrying a lamp I don't know who that lamb is but when that lamb comes you watch o King I'll see you in the morning that's true that's true in the mouth of two or three witnesses let it be established I agree with the trucks of the Living God we're coming out Hales trying to do its best but a rapture morning we're gonna look at death and say you lost we're gonna look at this flesh and say your loss temptation your loss I'll see you in the morning I don't know if that maybe you'll come on this side but that's gonna be a baby on that side it's got the Thomas name attached to it there's life there's life in this place Jesus Jesus Jesus is here Jesus is here Jesus is here Jesus is here Jesus is he ever oh just speak his
