[21:15] heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[21:17] we're so thankful to be able to come and
[21:18] be here once again and just thankful for
[21:21] the week that we've had and we know this
[21:23] season and the reason that we we have
[21:25] this season is you steep down from your
[21:27] from your kingdom to be able to come and
[21:28] be our kinsman redeemer Lord and I just
[21:31] ask that we would just all just not not
[21:33] forget that and just remember the reason
[21:35] and Lord I know that there's many that
[21:37] that during this time it's a it's even a
[21:39] it's a hard time of even depression
[21:41] there may be lost loved ones that's not
[21:42] sitting at the table or there's there's
[21:44] family that's gone or there's different
[21:46] reasons that would cause us cause
[21:48] depression to come in Lord and I just
[21:50] pray that you would just come in and
[21:51] just bring a sweep through the audience
[21:53] that we could just come into the go into
[21:55] the new year with a new Joy a new
[21:57] happiness and be able to fill us with
[21:59] the Holy Ghost Lord and that's what I'm
[22:01] asking in this season is what greater
[22:03] gift than to see a child or see a loved
[22:04] one filled with the Holy Ghost and
[22:06] that's what I'm believing tonight Lord
[22:08] I'm believing that you could just come
[22:09] in and touch the ones who are sick touch
[22:11] the ones who are fighting afflictions
[22:13] that that doctors are fighting TR
[22:15] struggles to just find a cure to or even
[22:18] find the answer to there's there's flu
[22:20] and different things that are hitting
[22:21] there's stomach bugs in this time that's
[22:23] that's causing ones to even have to go
[22:25] to the hospital and and get fluids Lord
[22:27] I just ask that you would just bring us
[22:29] strength and we know that even in these
[22:31] times that's how we know that you're the
[22:32] Healer and if we don't get sick we don't
[22:34] see that your healing hand will come in
[22:36] and touch us and Lord we just thank you
[22:38] for all that you're doing and I just
[22:39] thank you for what you're doing for our
[22:41] pastor and allowing him to see another
[22:43] Christmas season and five years we're
[22:45] here Lord five years of Grace and I just
[22:47] believe that we're about to see a
[22:48] Healing Hand come through and sweep
[22:50] through his body and be able to touch
[22:52] each and every organ that Satan's tried
[22:54] to wipe out from his body to be able to
[22:55] see new cells be regenerated and we know
[22:58] that if limbs could be restored you can
[23:00] regenerate the cells within his body and
[23:03] we're just so thankful for all that
[23:04] you're doing and we're just thankful for
[23:06] what you're going to do through brother
[23:07] Andrew tonight we just ask that you

[41:41] opening in into a new and and um you
[41:45] know I I have found that I have never
[41:47] been disappointed in the Lord but I
[41:49] sometimes I sometimes I go go to bed in
[41:51] the evenings and I just think you know
[41:53] I'm a little bit disappointed that he
[41:55] didn't come for me today but I wake wake
[41:57] up tomorrow the next day and I'm
[41:59] expecting him to come that day and I
[42:01] believe he could come just at any moment

[48:07] there father you said you never leave us
[48:09] and you never forsake us Lord we look
[48:12] back through
[48:14] the the traces of 2024 and we've seen
[48:18] you every step of the
[48:20] way you guided us to these moments we
[48:24] could look back and we could see the
[48:26] blood betrayal of Jesus Christ covering
[48:29] us when we don't have access and when
[48:32] the devil don't have access to the Sea
[48:35] of God's forgetfulness you have access
[48:38] to it and you can throw all of our sins
[48:40] in there you can throw all the things
[48:42] that we wish we could have done better
[48:44] in
[48:45] 2024 and we can look unto you the author
[48:47] and the finisher of our faith and father
[48:50] we are asking Lord as we get ready to
[48:53] close out these final moments
[48:57] I pray father that the Holy Spirit would
[48:59] just so envelope us with your presence
[49:03] oh
[49:04] god father wherever we have lacked
[49:07] wherever we have gone wrong wherever we
[49:10] just need a little bit of work we invite
[49:13] you father L into this
[49:16] place Lord you walk to a house and you
[49:19] weren't welcomed by a lot of men by a
[49:21] lot of the Sanhedrin and the scholars
[49:24] and the bigwigs of that day but there
[49:25] was a little bitty
[49:27] woman that welcomes
[49:29] you may you see that little bitty woman
[49:32] in this building tonight the Bride of
[49:35] Jesus Christ that has welcomed you and
[49:37] washed your
[49:38] feet oh God I pray that you would just
[49:41] come tonight and you would Minister To
[49:43] Us by the preaching of Thy word now
[49:46] father I've studied these quotes over
[49:48] and over and over again I've memorized
[49:51] them I've looked at them I've read
[49:54] scriptures but Lord I'm asking for that
[49:57] super anointing to that come sweeping
[49:59] down through Sportsman holla and brought
[50:01] a prophet just a just a charge of the
[50:04] Holy Ghost I'm asking for a super
[50:06] anointing to come and charge this little
[50:09] body of Believers here in Elton
[50:11] Virginia Lord that you would do
[50:14] something very special here tonight you
[50:17] have dealt with me specifically about
[50:19] this meeting tonight and I pray that
[50:22] we'd be looking for you
[50:24] tonight we just be really looking for
[50:27] you we just forget about the things of
[50:30] the world and lay aside everything and
[50:32] just turn our heart towards you just now
[50:36] if you have something for us in this
[50:38] service we want to find it with
[50:40] everything that's within us God we give
[50:44] you this service in Jesus name amen and
[50:49] amen if you have your Bibles this
[50:51] evening we'd like to look over into a
[50:52] few portions of
[50:54] scripture Matthew chapter 2 verse one
[50:59] also the book of Psalms chapter
[51:02] 62 and also the book of Romans chapter
[51:14] 8
[51:22] hallelujah hallelujah brother brandham
[51:25] said this in and why had to be Shepherds
[51:29] in 1964 it would be his last Christmas
[51:32] message to to the body of
[51:36] Believers he said this and I it struck
[51:39] me so
[51:40] powerful brother R said where is he
[51:43] that's born King of the Jews he said we
[51:45] saw his star in the
[51:47] east and that and that great religious
[51:51] Capital he said after two years of the
[51:54] shepherd's message still didn't have the
[51:57] answer or know nothing about it the head
[52:01] of all the
[52:02] denominations didn't have the answer to
[52:05] think that when when the wise men find
[52:09] him they don't find a little bitty baby
[52:12] but they find a
[52:13] 2-year-old but here these shepherds are
[52:16] carrying this message he didn't choose
[52:18] the greates of the world to carry it but
[52:21] he chose humble Shepherds to carry that
[52:24] message and there they were out there in
[52:27] that field and they were carrying that
[52:28] message and They carried it all the way
[52:30] through them cities and they still
[52:31] didn't have an answer for it now the
[52:34] Bible said in Matthew 2 and 1 now when
[52:36] Jesus was born in
[52:38] Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod
[52:41] the king behold there came wise men from
[52:44] the East to Jerusalem saying where is he
[52:47] born King of the Jews for we have seen
[52:51] his star in the east and are come to
[52:55] worship Him Psalms chapter
[52:58] 62 and verse
[53:02] 5 still a little bit muffled
[53:15] here I love this this one verse right
[53:18] here it's so powerful because because
[53:21] the writer he is not he's not saying
[53:23] that he's relying on his fellow men or
[53:26] he's not even relying on himself but he
[53:28] is relying on God Almighty in verse 5 it
[53:31] says my soul wait thou only upon God for
[53:36] my
[53:37] expectation is from him it matters where
[53:40] you get your expectation
[53:42] from Romans chapter 8 verse
[53:49] 19 for the earnest expectation of the
[53:53] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[53:56] of the sons of God for the creature was
[53:59] made subject to vanity not willingly but
[54:02] by reason of him who hath subjected the
[54:04] same and hope because the creature
[54:07] itself also shall be delivered from the
[54:10] bondage of corruption into the Glorious
[54:12] Liberty of the children of God for we
[54:15] know that the whole creation granth and
[54:18] travaileth in pain together until now
[54:21] and not only they but ourselves also
[54:24] which have the first fruits of the
[54:25] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[54:28] ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi
[54:31] the Redemption to with the Redemption of
[54:34] our body for we are saved by hope but
[54:37] hope that is seen is not hope for what a
[54:40] man seeth why do yet he hop for it but
[54:44] if we hope for that we see not then do
[54:47] we have patience to wait for may God
[54:51] bless his word you may be seated tonight
[54:54] here in the presence of the Lord and I'd
[54:56] like to just take a little thought this
[54:58] evening on the expectation for the king
[55:01] expectation for The King and I I just
[55:03] begin to ponder some things over the
[55:06] past couple weeks and just begin to just
[55:09] begin to ponder why why is it that God
[55:12] has a certain season or a certain time
[55:15] that he is that he's holding or he
[55:17] begins to release prophecy at that
[55:20] certain time why is it at this moment
[55:22] that we've read in the scriptures that
[55:24] we've we we've recognized our Lord's
[55:27] birth but why is it that he that he
[55:29] comes at that certain season and why
[55:31] didn't he come sooner and why maybe he
[55:33] didn't maybe my maybe why didn't he
[55:36] Terry just a little bit longer but God
[55:39] God we realize that the cogs of Prophecy
[55:42] they run very slow but they are always
[55:44] very sure and when God finds that all
[55:47] the elements of Prophecy have come into
[55:50] position then God begins to say all
[55:53] things are ready now and we realize that
[55:56] when whenever God says something in the
[55:58] promise or in Prophecy we realize that
[56:01] it causes an expectation on the on the
[56:05] inside of a Believer to look for the
[56:07] Fulfillment of that of that scripture as
[56:10] it's coming to pass now Webster tells us
[56:13] that expectation it is the act of of of
[56:16] looking forward to a future event with
[56:19] at least some reason to believe that the
[56:22] event will happen he says that the
[56:24] expectation differs from Hope because
[56:26] hope originates in desire and it may
[56:29] exist with little to no ground uh of
[56:31] belief that the desired event will
[56:33] arrive he said but expectation is
[56:36] founded on reasons and beliefs which
[56:39] rendered the event probable and I I
[56:42] think it I think it's very very
[56:44] fundamental that we realize that our
[56:46] expectations that we have in the Lord
[56:48] that they have a foundation on which
[56:51] they are built upon that we're not just
[56:53] here hoping for something and in vain of
[56:55] thinking it's going to happen but we
[56:57] have an expectation from the Lord that
[56:59] will be met I could say it to you like
[57:02] this what if I told you that in this
[57:04] sermon tonight it has the ability to
[57:07] change your destiny it has the ability
[57:09] to change your mind to loose you to set
[57:12] you free to heal your body if I told you
[57:15] those things if I if I told you those
[57:17] things it would heighten your
[57:19] expectation to to expect the
[57:21] supernatural in this place you would
[57:24] begin to look for it if I begin to tell
[57:25] you that this could happen that that
[57:28] brother Ron could get his healing right
[57:29] now sister sister sister Anna could get
[57:32] a a real touch from the Lord Brother
[57:34] Denny could have receive a real promise
[57:35] from the Lord it would heighten your
[57:37] expectation in such a way that you would
[57:40] be looking for the Lord Jesus just to
[57:43] maybe come down a different avenue that
[57:45] maybe he wouldn't wouldn't necessarily
[57:47] come down but all of a sudden because of
[57:49] a word from the Lord it heightens your
[57:51] expectation that the moment that we have
[57:54] been looking for is in the building
[57:56] you see you see real we realize that
[57:59] sometimes that a minister of God doesn't
[58:00] even realize sometimes what he is saying
[58:03] he but simply he's being led by the
[58:06] spirit of almighty God it doesn't even
[58:07] realize that it's that it's prophecy
[58:09] that is coming out of his mouth and all
[58:11] of a sudden prophecy strikes the
[58:13] individual that has faith and that Faith
[58:15] turns it into a real promise a tangible
[58:18] promise and no longer is it a a promise
[58:21] but now it's a possession that the
[58:23] believer can say I have it I I was
[58:25] expecting and I I believed it and now I
[58:27] and now I have it one time I was
[58:29] speaking at a camp and I was just I was
[58:31] just going down a line and the spirit of
[58:33] the Lord was leading me and I all of a
[58:34] sudden I started going and I started
[58:36] preaching about about God is a God that
[58:39] defeats cancer and he's he's that kind
[58:41] of a God in Zimbabwe and now now you
[58:43] know good and well I ain't never been in
[58:45] Zimbabwe and Zimbabwe is not necessarily
[58:47] that something that's on this old
[58:49] country boy's mind all the time but the
[58:51] spirit of the Lord was leading me down a
[58:52] little road but it was an encouragement
[58:54] for a sister that was in that building
[58:57] and she she was needing and at the
[58:59] beginning of that service the spirit of
[59:01] God said now today there's going to be a
[59:03] miracle in this place and it caused an A
[59:06] A A heightened awareness to be looking
[59:08] for the Supernatural and when that
[59:10] sister heard that word from the Lord she
[59:12] said that's for my mama that just got
[59:14] diagnosed with cancer over there that
[59:17] little woman that was all the way over
[59:18] there wasn't even a believer at the time
[59:21] but because of the word of the Lord she
[59:23] began to recognize that this was her
[59:25] moment and God healed her and God saved
[59:28] her and God is the kind of God that
[59:30] maybe you don't understand why a man of
[59:33] God is being led that kind of way but
[59:35] all of a
[59:36] sudden I'd say it was all of a sudden
[59:39] that Mary was walking down the road and
[59:41] she saw an angel step out I say it was
[59:43] all of a sudden that Peter was in an
[59:45] upper room and the Holy Ghost was poured
[59:47] out I'd say it was all of a sudden that
[59:49] William Brandon was in a cave and then
[59:51] an angel stepped in I'll say it was all
[59:53] of a sudden when brother Ron received
[59:55] his healing when he was in Uva and he
[59:57] was burned by a fire I said it was all
[59:59] of a sudden and I believe it's all of a
[1:00:02] sudden that our
[1:00:05] expectations can be met by the
[1:00:09] supernatural you say well does it really
[1:00:12] does it really mean anything when I
[1:00:14] begin to amen the word does it really
[1:00:16] affect does it really take effect when
[1:00:18] you begin to amen the word I'll say
[1:00:20] absolutely it does because it changes
[1:00:22] your your negative attitude and it
[1:00:24] changes your negative position
[1:00:26] and it puts you in line with the word of
[1:00:28] God where you wasn't already there when
[1:00:30] you begin to say so be it almighty God
[1:00:33] you begin to line up your faith with
[1:00:35] something that you're not supposed to
[1:00:37] have you begin to line up your faith
[1:00:39] with God's word and all of a sudden it
[1:00:42] brings a promise to you and you don't
[1:00:44] even realize that it's happening but a
[1:00:46] charge sweeps over your
[1:00:49] body I love what brother man was said in
[1:00:52] the in the adoption series he he he
[1:00:54] looks there and he said with Earnest
[1:00:56] expectation the whole creation is
[1:00:58] waiting for the manifestation he said
[1:01:01] now what is the manifestation he asked
[1:01:03] the question he said it's the making
[1:01:05] known he said now the whole world he
[1:01:07] said the muhammadans Over Yonder they're
[1:01:10] looking for it all around everywhere
[1:01:12] they're looking for it where is these
[1:01:14] people now the whole creation is
[1:01:16] groaning and they're waiting for the
[1:01:19] manifestation of the sons of God you see
[1:01:22] you see that word that is there in the
[1:01:25] Greek of upper cader it is the word of
[1:01:29] expectation and it is only used two
[1:01:31] times in the New Testament in
[1:01:33] Philippians 1 and 20 and in Romans 8 and
[1:01:36] 19 and Paul says according to my
[1:01:39] expectation and in my and my hope that
[1:01:42] in nothing I shall be ashamed but that
[1:01:45] with all build boldness and as always so
[1:01:48] now also Christ shall be magnified in my
[1:01:51] body whether it be be by life or whether
[1:01:54] it be by Death now when Paul he chooses
[1:01:58] this word in the Greek language he uses
[1:02:01] it with such power and intention because
[1:02:04] he's wanting to denote such a state of
[1:02:06] interest that is that that turns the
[1:02:09] believer's heart that their desire is
[1:02:12] for a certain object or a
[1:02:15] subject so Paul is very he's very
[1:02:18] instrumental where he places his word
[1:02:20] out and I find it amazing that he places
[1:02:23] it right there in the in the Book of
[1:02:25] Romans in the in that revelation of the
[1:02:27] adoption of a son being placed if you
[1:02:30] look at that scripture it depicts your
[1:02:32] entire life that whole chapter depicts
[1:02:35] the depicts the life of a Believer and
[1:02:38] when Paul drops that in there that the
[1:02:40] earnest expectation that the down
[1:02:42] payment of you hoping for and believing
[1:02:46] for it is showing something of intense
[1:02:49] interest that the believer is looking to
[1:02:52] fulfill his future inheritance
[1:02:56] now when you look at expectation in the
[1:02:58] natural and you look at expectation in
[1:03:00] the Supernatural or spiritual
[1:03:03] expectation can cause
[1:03:05] disappointments because when
[1:03:07] expectations are set too high and the
[1:03:09] reality doesn't meet your expectations
[1:03:11] you walk away feeling disappointed in it
[1:03:14] expectation can also cause motivation it
[1:03:18] it it when when expectation can Inspire
[1:03:20] an individual so that they work harder
[1:03:23] or strive to meet God's demands and and
[1:03:26] they begin to use expectation as a
[1:03:29] motivational Force but expectation can
[1:03:32] also cause you stress because when you
[1:03:35] have an high or an unrealistic
[1:03:37] expectation it can C it can cause a
[1:03:40] potential a a potential a affecting your
[1:03:43] mental health in such a way because you
[1:03:46] have these expectations and because they
[1:03:48] don't get met because you set them by
[1:03:50] human standards you begin to get
[1:03:52] stressed out and feel the pressure of
[1:03:54] maybe maybe this one maybe this one
[1:03:56] thinks I really don't believe because I
[1:03:58] ain't received my healing yet or I I
[1:03:59] ain't receiv received my promise yet but
[1:04:01] what really it is it is it is Hope
[1:04:04] instead of expectation but when you've
[1:04:06] got an expectation from God God has
[1:04:09] never let his expectation of a believing
[1:04:12] son and daughter of God fall to the
[1:04:14] ground and then not be brought to pass
[1:04:17] you see it it's kind of like it's kind
[1:04:19] of like at movie or that show that Andy
[1:04:21] griffi show that Opie you remember Andy
[1:04:24] got real mad at Opie one time he was
[1:04:26] going around and he was selling licorice
[1:04:27] seeds for for kids and Andy was getting
[1:04:29] all over op because because he knew he
[1:04:32] was selling them in vain because there's
[1:04:33] no such thing as liquor seeds and he was
[1:04:35] going around telling all these kids
[1:04:36] you're going to have these liquor seeds
[1:04:37] you plant these things you get your
[1:04:38] liquor sticks up and Andy knew he said
[1:04:41] he he knew good and well that he wasn't
[1:04:42] going to get no liquor stick so he's
[1:04:43] giving him false hope and I believe that
[1:04:45] so many times that that people have have
[1:04:48] been have been receiving false hope and
[1:04:51] they've been receiving something that
[1:04:52] that isn't going to come to pass but but
[1:04:55] you have receive something that that the
[1:04:57] world didn't give you and and the and
[1:04:59] the and books didn't give you because
[1:05:01] you see you were seed therefore you
[1:05:04] could be reborn you have not been sold a
[1:05:06] false hope that healing can come to you
[1:05:09] and that manifestations can come to you
[1:05:11] and that you can change your body by the
[1:05:14] power of Resurrection because if you've
[1:05:16] got that kind of expectation it will
[1:05:18] cause a
[1:05:20] result a result that will change your
[1:05:22] mentality from negativity to positive
[1:05:25] ity from sickness to health come on
[1:05:28] somebody from being broke to being the
[1:05:31] richest man in the city I'm talking
[1:05:33] about the kind of guy that don't even
[1:05:35] have enough money to buy a moped then
[1:05:38] all of a sudden you're rolling up in a
[1:05:39] Rolls-Royce because you got expectations
[1:05:43] not from a man but from a
[1:05:49] king it's powerful when you begin to
[1:05:51] expect something from a king now if
[1:05:54] you're expecting something from from a
[1:05:55] janitor you might end up with a mop you
[1:05:57] might end up with a broom but if you're
[1:05:59] expecting something from a king a king's
[1:06:01] going to give you something that only a
[1:06:03] king can give you a king ain't going to
[1:06:05] give you a chicken and a king ain't
[1:06:07] going to give you some he ain't going to
[1:06:09] give you some broke down Pinto he's
[1:06:11] going to give you something that only a
[1:06:13] king could give you so a king is going
[1:06:16] to give you a kingdom and a king is
[1:06:18] going to give you a crown and a king is
[1:06:20] going to give you King peace and King
[1:06:22] health and King wealth
[1:06:25] let me preach just a minute he'll give
[1:06:27] you a king's sword and a king's
[1:06:29] Revelation and a king's body
[1:06:35] change
[1:06:38] woo you see the reality of God's
[1:06:41] expectations will always lead to God
[1:06:46] Godly
[1:06:48] results you show me a time that the
[1:06:51] world let you down and I show you a time
[1:06:53] that he's always been faithful
[1:06:56] come on somebody you show me a time you
[1:06:58] show me a time where where Satan let you
[1:07:01] down or Leota let you down and I'll show
[1:07:03] you a time that he was always there you
[1:07:06] tell me a time where his mercies wasn't
[1:07:08] new tell me a time when he wasn't able
[1:07:11] to carry you through tell me a time that
[1:07:13] he that he was less than Almighty and
[1:07:15] I'll say it like this there's never a
[1:07:18] time but I'll say it like this but this
[1:07:21] is the
[1:07:23] time he was waiting for Mary to come to
[1:07:26] 16 year old old where she could put so
[1:07:28] she could bring for the son he was
[1:07:31] waiting on Isaiah to get to a spot that
[1:07:33] he could prophesy when nobody else would
[1:07:36] believe and but Isaiah had an
[1:07:41] expectation it wasn't my
[1:07:44] words that For unto us a son is given
[1:07:47] unto us a child is born it wasn't my
[1:07:50] words it wasn't my words that said that
[1:07:53] he should be a ruler he'll be a ruler of
[1:07:56] many nations and the government shall be
[1:07:58] upon then wasn't my
[1:08:01] words they come from another
[1:08:05] realm I love what Paul
[1:08:08] says in the book of Hebrews chapter 9
[1:08:11] and 28 so Christ was once offered to
[1:08:14] Bear the sins of many and unto them that
[1:08:18] look for him shall he appear the second
[1:08:20] time I love what Brother Martin would
[1:08:22] tell us in the message he said he's
[1:08:24] appearing unto us for one
[1:08:26] reason he's wanting to reveal himself so
[1:08:29] he he's appearing in this season for
[1:08:31] such a Time Paul would say in the in the
[1:08:34] in the letter to in 2 Timothy 4 and8 he
[1:08:37] said For unto me henceforth is given
[1:08:39] unto me a crown of righteousness but to
[1:08:42] not to me only but to all them that love
[1:08:46] his
[1:08:47] appearing Hallelujah and when he comes
[1:08:50] he will come without sin under salvation
[1:08:53] the first time he came he had your sin
[1:08:55] on him but this time when he comes he'll
[1:08:58] be have no sins on
[1:09:02] him Hallelujah I love what brother
[1:09:05] random said an unbelief doesn't hinder
[1:09:07] God he said could you imagine a man
[1:09:09] being away from his wife for years a
[1:09:11] lovely sweet wife knowing that any
[1:09:13] moment that he'll appear and she's going
[1:09:15] to see him he said why her whole
[1:09:18] anticipation I sitting right on seeing
[1:09:20] him right at once just looking for him
[1:09:22] to appear at any time you can imagine
[1:09:24] the long in her heart you can imagine
[1:09:27] how how she was waiting on the sound of
[1:09:30] the horses coming down for her and when
[1:09:33] brother brandham comes and he preaches
[1:09:35] he preaches on the presence of God
[1:09:38] unrecognized and brother brandham is
[1:09:40] coming down he's coming down to the end
[1:09:42] of the end of the service and it begins
[1:09:45] to break into a line of discernment he
[1:09:47] said now he said if one of you if he
[1:09:49] would speak to you one or two of you he
[1:09:52] said then that would be infallible
[1:09:54] because in the mouth of two three
[1:09:55] Witnesses let it be established he said
[1:09:58] now how many would say that you
[1:10:00] recognize his presence and the whole
[1:10:04] congregation you can hear them saying
[1:10:06] amen I can imagine they was lifting
[1:10:08] their hands and saying amen he said now
[1:10:11] I love this because brother brandom said
[1:10:13] that is all that is necessary that's all
[1:10:17] that is necessary let me say it like
[1:10:19] this you don't need your bre your best
[1:10:22] friend to be sitting beside you all the
[1:10:24] time
[1:10:25] you don't need your pastor holding your
[1:10:27] hand and putting a pastor fire in your
[1:10:30] mouth all the time but if you can
[1:10:32] recognize the presence of almighty God
[1:10:35] that's all that is necessary come on
[1:10:38] somebody I don't need to feel a chill
[1:10:40] run over my back I don't need to have
[1:10:42] somebody lay their hands on me but if I
[1:10:45] can recognize the presence of the
[1:10:49] king that's all that's NE well you say
[1:10:52] what's necessary for my healing just
[1:10:54] believe what's necessary for a body
[1:10:56] change Hallelujah just believe that's
[1:11:00] all that's
[1:11:02] necessary well I believe we can preach a
[1:11:04] whole sermon on that that's all that's
[1:11:09] necessary now God will show you his will
[1:11:13] if you're looking for it and in every
[1:11:16] age he's always had a believer that has
[1:11:19] always looking for the Fulfillment of it
[1:11:22] because there was a man by the name of
[1:11:23] Simeon if you look at s he he is known
[1:11:27] as the god receiver that he had been
[1:11:30] talked to by the holy spirit that he was
[1:11:32] not going to taste death until he seen
[1:11:34] the Lord's Christ so brother Bon would
[1:11:36] preach a whole entire sermon on Simeon
[1:11:38] and he would call it expectation and
[1:11:40] here's Simeon the god receiver brother
[1:11:42] bam would say it like this he revealed
[1:11:44] himself to those that was waiting on him
[1:11:47] he said one of them was John the Baptist
[1:11:49] the Apostles of John the Baptist of
[1:11:51] Simeon and blind little Anna but it was
[1:11:54] the Holy Spirit spirit that was leading
[1:11:56] them to look for him and expect
[1:12:00] him I'd say that that morning as when
[1:12:04] Mary and Joseph walked down there on the
[1:12:06] eighth day to have Jesus circumcised
[1:12:09] before the high priest I'd say there was
[1:12:11] hundreds of babies that was walking in
[1:12:14] that Temple but what what caused the
[1:12:17] attraction there was something that was
[1:12:19] hanging to this little boy that was not
[1:12:22] hanging to the rest of them and it was a
[1:12:24] prophecy that had been laying there from
[1:12:27] the foundation of the world expectation
[1:12:30] has got to be have a foundation to
[1:12:33] it so the reason why you can believe
[1:12:36] you're going in the Rapture was because
[1:12:38] you have a foundation and that
[1:12:40] Foundation is he thought of you before
[1:12:43] the foundation of the
[1:12:45] world this little child had such an
[1:12:48] atmosphere about
[1:12:51] him that it calls the God re
[1:12:55] to go immediately to him I can imagine
[1:12:58] him passing through the prayer line and
[1:13:01] going directly to the need so this is
[1:13:04] what we've been looking for the king is
[1:13:06] here we waited for this moment and it's
[1:13:09] finally here brother maram said that God
[1:13:12] LED Simeon to his full
[1:13:17] expectancy I love what he goes on to say
[1:13:20] he said are you expecting to be healed
[1:13:21] tonight
[1:13:25] how many needs healing are you expecting
[1:13:28] to be healing healing tonight if you are
[1:13:30] the Holy Ghost has led you to the right
[1:13:33] place are you expecting it then be
[1:13:39] ready all things are ready everything's
[1:13:43] ready Isaiah prophecy is coming
[1:13:46] fulfilled what God speaks to the serpent
[1:13:49] in the Garden of Eden it's being
[1:13:52] fulfilled everything's coming to it's
[1:13:54] fulfillment and it's all coming together
[1:13:56] and and you may be not even able to wrap
[1:13:59] your your mind around how fast prophecy
[1:14:02] is coming to its fulfillment but it had
[1:14:05] had come to a spot that when Jesus was
[1:14:09] coming that there was three elect men
[1:14:12] that had been caught up in a in a
[1:14:15] supernatural meeting because they
[1:14:17] realized that there was a prophecy that
[1:14:20] was going to come into fruition where
[1:14:22] they were visibly going to see a star so
[1:14:25] they were looking for it and because
[1:14:27] balam said that a star was going to rise
[1:14:29] out of Jacob there was the three wise
[1:14:33] men these three wise men that were
[1:14:36] looking they were looking for him where
[1:14:38] is he at where's he at is he is he in
[1:14:41] this place is he in this church is he in
[1:14:44] this Hall is he in this
[1:14:48] denomination I read this to you a few
[1:14:50] weekends ago and brother M said he said
[1:14:52] what a striking event it is at this day
[1:14:55] that God has taken uneducated men boys
[1:14:58] and girls who probably have no more than
[1:15:00] a grammar school education has raised up
[1:15:02] by the power of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:15:05] crying in their ears of the church he's
[1:15:07] hearing this great power to unfold
[1:15:09] himself and to make himself known and
[1:15:11] the church knows nothing about it he
[1:15:13] said they come to give homage and they
[1:15:15] they come to give him homage and they
[1:15:17] come to give honor to the King of Kings
[1:15:20] they were not Kings but they were great
[1:15:22] enough to be honored guests of the king
[1:15:24] and they said where is he that's born
[1:15:26] King of the Jews he said the Bible said
[1:15:28] that all Jerusalem and Herod also were
[1:15:32] troubled their
[1:15:33] testimony stirred
[1:15:36] something it stirred something in all of
[1:15:38] a city it stirred something in all of el
[1:15:42] when when Dylan and Devon got saved it
[1:15:44] stirred
[1:15:46] something it stirred something when
[1:15:49] Chris Morris gave his heart to the Lord
[1:15:51] it stirred something when the thing that
[1:15:54] you've been looking for finally shows up
[1:15:57] you're no longer expecting it you're in
[1:16:01] the moment of
[1:16:04] it some of you look for the Holy Ghost
[1:16:08] maybe it seemed like you were looking
[1:16:09] for it longer than others were but when
[1:16:12] you got it you weren't expecting it no
[1:16:15] more it's like these little kids they
[1:16:18] were looking forward to the December the
[1:16:20] 25th because they were expecting that's
[1:16:22] the day we get to open the present
[1:16:25] but on December the 25th they didn't
[1:16:28] have to ask no more they were in the
[1:16:30] moment of
[1:16:33] it you are in the moment of Malachi 4
[1:16:36] you don't have to ask for it no
[1:16:40] more you're in it you're looking for it
[1:16:44] and you're in
[1:16:51] it
[1:16:53] Hallelujah Hall
[1:16:55] it's worth going across hot deserts and
[1:16:58] finding out whether he's a true God or
[1:16:59] not this little woman had something on
[1:17:02] the inside of her that you heard about
[1:17:03] the wisdom of Solomon is that this same
[1:17:06] yesterday today and forever it was worth
[1:17:08] her to go across a hot desert on camel's
[1:17:12] back and she found out that he was the
[1:17:14] same yesterday today and forever that
[1:17:16] can't be more than William bram's
[1:17:18] Revelation that's got to be your
[1:17:21] Revelation it's got to be more than
[1:17:23] brother Ron's and it's got to be more
[1:17:25] than mine I tell you one of the greatest
[1:17:27] Revelations that you can have is that
[1:17:28] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:17:32] forever because if he did it in William
[1:17:34] brandom's day he'll do it in my
[1:17:38] day I know it's spold statements but I
[1:17:41] believe that a vision could show up in
[1:17:42] this room and change the mular status of
[1:17:46] your body and all of a sudden cells
[1:17:49] start changing and bodies start moving
[1:17:55] [Applause]
[1:17:58] you forgive me of my passion I've been
[1:18:00] eating on
[1:18:02] this it's who I
[1:18:06] am you can you cannot imagine what it's
[1:18:09] like for a man of God to stand here and
[1:18:13] realize that we're coming to the
[1:18:15] Fulfillment of it we've looked for it
[1:18:17] we've waited for it and now we're in it
[1:18:21] you cannot imagine my anticipation to
[1:18:23] watch you change brother Jerry you
[1:18:26] cannot imagine my anticipation to watch
[1:18:29] you change brother Stan you cannot
[1:18:31] imagine my anticipation to watch my
[1:18:34] grandmother Nancy
[1:18:37] change that the message that William
[1:18:39] brandom carried that the message at
[1:18:42] Homer Fraser carried that the message at
[1:18:44] Ron Spencer carried that the message
[1:18:46] that I've carried has had the effect on
[1:18:49] your life
[1:18:55] come on somebody you can't get your
[1:18:56] heightened your expectations heightened
[1:18:59] out there on chicken feed but something
[1:19:01] has heightened your anticipation to
[1:19:04] believe
[1:19:11] it you have had example after example to
[1:19:14] point two you have had Miracle after
[1:19:16] Miracle to point two but job did not
[1:19:19] have one Miracle job didn't have one
[1:19:22] letter job didn't have one script
[1:19:24] scripture but yet on the inside of him
[1:19:27] something cried out I know that my
[1:19:29] redeemer lives let me say this take my
[1:19:32] Bible from me take my mp3s away take my
[1:19:36] tapes take my iPad but you'll never
[1:19:38] destroy my
[1:19:43] expectation blessed be the name of
[1:19:46] almighty God somebody give him praise
[1:19:51] [Applause]
[1:19:59] brother manom would say it like this he
[1:20:01] would say now a starving child will eat
[1:20:04] it out of a garbage can if he's got two
[1:20:07] you ain't got two you got a seven course
[1:20:10] menu you can feed on but if you are
[1:20:12] starving to death brother Ram types it
[1:20:15] like Faith he said if you're starving to
[1:20:17] death and you just need a loaf of bread
[1:20:19] to cure your starving this he said if I
[1:20:22] gave you a quarter
[1:20:24] you could be as happy about that bread
[1:20:27] as you could be about that quarter and
[1:20:29] that quarter as you could be about that
[1:20:31] bread because that bread that bread cost
[1:20:34] a quarter and if you got that quarter
[1:20:37] you have the purchasing power of it now
[1:20:40] let me say it like this Faith ain't your
[1:20:42] healing but faith will produce your
[1:20:45] healing and you can be as excited about
[1:20:48] your faith that you believe he's the
[1:20:50] same yesterday today and
[1:20:52] forever as you have the baby BBE that's
[1:20:55] we we're jumping in your womb you can be
[1:20:58] as excited about the healing of your
[1:21:00] complexes if you got the
[1:21:06] faith you can be as excited about your
[1:21:08] body change as just because you got the
[1:21:11] faith of it you can be as excited about
[1:21:13] brother Ron's healing because you got
[1:21:15] the faith for
[1:21:17] it because that faith is an expectation
[1:21:21] that you don't know how and you don't
[1:21:23] know when but I know I know I know some
[1:21:28] of you been seeking some of you been
[1:21:35] asking your moment of expectation has
[1:21:39] met prophecy and the pillar of fire is
[1:21:42] here to prove that prophecy is a
[1:21:52] reality Ben Franklin had a c
[1:21:55] he got lit up one night and he said I
[1:21:57] got it but he didn't know what he
[1:21:59] had but it took a man by the name of
[1:22:02] Thomas Edison finally figured out what
[1:22:04] Ben Franklin was talking about the
[1:22:06] Pentecostals shouted about it and they
[1:22:08] said they had it but they didn't know if
[1:22:10] they shouting about but there's a body
[1:22:12] on Earth that knows what they're
[1:22:14] shouting about they know they got a
[1:22:16] right to speak in tongues they got a
[1:22:18] they got a right to Pardon they got a
[1:22:20] right to heal they got a right to the
[1:22:22] Holy Ghost
[1:22:26] I got
[1:22:27] it I think Terry edwell you sing that
[1:22:29] song I got it I got it ay something
[1:22:32] about the power of the Holy Ghost said I
[1:22:34] got it oh I got
[1:22:37] it come on somebody I know what I'm
[1:22:41] talking about this ain't just Homer
[1:22:43] Fraser's religion this ain't just
[1:22:45] Charlie Spencer's religion this ain't
[1:22:47] just William brandom's religion this
[1:22:49] ain't just James Wall's religion it's
[1:22:52] just mine
[1:22:58] I got
[1:22:59] it I got it I got it it's something
[1:23:04] about the power of the Holy Ghost and I
[1:23:07] got it oh I got it look at your neighbor
[1:23:12] and say I got
[1:23:13] it if you ain't got it come to a source
[1:23:16] where you can say I got it I got it I

[1:23:22] got it out there in the Pew I got it I
[1:23:25] got it I got
[1:23:29] it it ain't a hope so it's a
[1:23:33] [Applause]
[1:23:35] reality blessed
[1:23:37] be the name of the
[1:23:44] lord it's just another service for some
[1:23:46] people but for blind Bas he knew
[1:23:49] something was different about the town's
[1:23:52] talk and about the people shouting there
[1:23:54] was something
[1:23:58] different there been a lot of people
[1:24:00] walk by him but there something
[1:24:02] different about this guy there something
[1:24:04] that was there was something about the
[1:24:07] shout that caused his attraction to say
[1:24:10] thou son of
[1:24:14] David his expectation became a reality
[1:24:18] when his eyes come
[1:24:21] open let me say this there's there a lot
[1:24:24] of people that looked at this message
[1:24:26] for a long time and they was trying to
[1:24:29] figure it out is this really Malachi 4
[1:24:33] your expectation was met when your eyes
[1:24:35] come
[1:24:36] open this is him this is the King's
[1:24:39] message this ain't some Kentucky boy
[1:24:42] this ain't some hillbilly that got this
[1:24:44] got this out of his mind he there's no
[1:24:46] way he could put these things together
[1:24:48] but your eyes began to come open to it
[1:24:51] he wasn't talking he wasn't lying about
[1:24:53] them squirrels he wasn't wasn't lying
[1:24:54] about that little girl by hady ride he
[1:24:56] wasn't lying about that storm up there
[1:24:58] in Colorado he was telling the truth
[1:25:01] because the reality of it is that same
[1:25:03] power is now in a body of
[1:25:08] Believers one of my
[1:25:11] greatest my greatest thoughts that keep
[1:25:13] that keep me just pondering
[1:25:16] Lord is said can you imagine his
[1:25:21] expectation that you're finally here
[1:25:26] some of you have moved you you left your
[1:25:30] homes you waited to get
[1:25:34] here but the reality of it is when
[1:25:38] you're settled and everything's just
[1:25:40] right in
[1:25:44] place you
[1:25:46] imagine forgive me I need to
[1:25:50] preach there's so many people that are
[1:25:52] blind to it there's so many people that
[1:25:55] are blind to it and they can't see it
[1:25:57] but for you it's a reality there was
[1:25:59] something there was something worth that
[1:26:01] Queen of the South going all that way
[1:26:04] there was something of you that made you
[1:26:06] raise your hand up brother mam said it
[1:26:09] in one way he said the reason why that
[1:26:11] lady raised up her hand the pillar of
[1:26:13] fire swept over her way there's a reason
[1:26:16] why you shout there's a reason why you
[1:26:19] amen there's a reason why you're under
[1:26:21] the ministry in Malachi 4 it's something
[1:26:24] that he has
[1:26:26] anticipated and now it's
[1:26:29] here no man gave you this
[1:26:32] seed this come from the mind of God
[1:26:36] brother mam said in a seven seal he said
[1:26:37] if you want to know what the mind of God
[1:26:39] is he said it's the
[1:26:44] supernatural what do you mean brother
[1:26:45] I'm saying it's kind of like this it was
[1:26:47] so unusual that Joseph believed Mary but
[1:26:51] it was
[1:26:52] Supernatural to to us it's supernatural
[1:26:55] but to God it's natural it's just
[1:26:58] natural for him to be Supernatural but
[1:27:00] for us
[1:27:03] wow you you imagine blind berus he sat
[1:27:07] there all of his
[1:27:09] life
[1:27:11] wow man I can't believe I've been
[1:27:13] sitting by this cruddy old wall where
[1:27:16] Joshua cast him walls down all the days
[1:27:19] of my life had William bham get that
[1:27:22] story he saw it
[1:27:26] happening how did William brandham start
[1:27:29] telling us about another St another
[1:27:33] city they saw it coming
[1:27:36] in and a bride in possession and some
[1:27:39] people say what are you so worked up
[1:27:40] about why are you so excited what makes
[1:27:43] you literally what makes you keep
[1:27:46] listening to it he's been dead for over
[1:27:49] 55 years
[1:27:52] now and there's a lot of people that
[1:27:54] blind to it there's a lot of people that
[1:27:56] was walking with Noah they didn't see no
[1:27:58] rain up here but he saw that rain
[1:28:00] there's a lot of people that was walking
[1:28:01] with Abraham he saw her he saw Sarah
[1:28:04] with a baby but the scoffers didn't see
[1:28:06] her with no baby come on somebody this
[1:28:09] star passed over every Observatory and
[1:28:12] they said well our wise men ain't seeing
[1:28:13] that but the three little boys for three
[1:28:17] wise men for three Magi for three kings
[1:28:21] they said we have saw his star and we
[1:28:23] are coming come to worship
[1:28:26] him well I don't see it like that well I
[1:28:31] do come on so I don't see this being the
[1:28:33] end of Malachi for a minute well I do
[1:28:36] I've met the same one that came in that
[1:28:39] car with Eddie bisco and William
[1:28:41] brandham and sat down in between them I
[1:28:44] have handled him I have felt the
[1:28:46] influence of that same
[1:28:48] Angel you say well I don't believe it I
[1:28:50] don't believe in Divine Healing the
[1:28:51] reason why you don't believe in it is
[1:28:53] because there's nothing continue to
[1:28:54] believe
[1:28:56] with you ain't going to get blood from a
[1:28:58] turnup because ain't no blood in there
[1:29:01] if you're going to get Faith from
[1:29:02] something you got to get it from
[1:29:04] something that's got faith in it so God
[1:29:07] put something on the inside of you that
[1:29:09] will produce what he's been looking for
[1:29:12] and it's the blood of Jesus
[1:29:15] Christ I'm so excited I could speak in
[1:29:17] tongues the rest of the
[1:29:19] night God deposited something on the
[1:29:22] inside of you because he knew that you
[1:29:24] would produce exactly what he was
[1:29:27] looking
[1:29:30] for
[1:29:33] Al a farmer ain't going to expect a
[1:29:35] harvest without planting a
[1:29:39] seed and God ain't expecting a miracle
[1:29:41] out of somebody that ain't got no
[1:29:49] faith what you saying brother Andrew I'm
[1:29:52] saying it like this that William
[1:29:54] brandham said that a man that lives by
[1:29:56] faith and walks by faith he said I mean
[1:29:59] substance Faith he is isolated from the
[1:30:01] entire world and he becomes a new
[1:30:04] Creator creature in Christ he said
[1:30:06] there's now there now you're getting
[1:30:09] into bride material when you begin to
[1:30:11] isolate yourself from all the things of
[1:30:14] the world and you begin to be made new
[1:30:17] Under the ministry and you begin to be
[1:30:19] made new and you become a new creature
[1:30:21] in Christ Jesus you begin to get in
[1:30:23] Bride material IAL and he said you're
[1:30:25] getting in a Rapture and conditioned in
[1:30:27] it didn't make a whole lot of sense when
[1:30:29] John Ryan is standing there and William
[1:30:31] Brandon pronounced that he was healed it
[1:30:33] didn't make a whole lot of sense to him
[1:30:35] that he couldn't see no more he he it
[1:30:37] didn't make no sense to him that he
[1:30:38] couldn't see yet and he got himself back
[1:30:40] in the line and you know the story and
[1:30:42] John Ryan said you said I was healed and
[1:30:44] William Brandon said you know you said
[1:30:46] that you believe me you see there's
[1:30:49] power in holding on to your confession
[1:30:52] whether your friends believe it
[1:30:54] or whether your doctor believes it or
[1:30:56] whether the high physician believes it
[1:30:58] or the professors of colleges believe it
[1:31:01] there is power into holding on to your
[1:31:05] confession Faith isn't about seeing
[1:31:07] instant results it's about trusting God
[1:31:10] and trusting his timing and it's
[1:31:14] powerful when you stand there and you
[1:31:16] say I don't care what I see I don't care
[1:31:18] what I feel I declare that I'm a
[1:31:21] Believer
[1:31:26] before Mary ever felt Jesus kick she was
[1:31:28] professing that she was carrying a baby
[1:31:31] come on sisters it's well I'm getting
[1:31:33] too old to start carrying a baby I read
[1:31:35] it in the message the other day there
[1:31:37] was a woman that William Brandon
[1:31:39] prophesied that she was going to receive
[1:31:40] a baby and she she be to doubt when the
[1:31:43] promise didn't come n and all of a
[1:31:45] sudden she got a sickness that come over
[1:31:47] her body and William brandham ran into
[1:31:49] her husband in another prayer line in a
[1:31:51] totally different city he said I see you
[1:31:54] you were already you were already
[1:31:56] prophesied that you was going to have
[1:31:58] you was going to have a child he said
[1:31:59] well that's true but my my wife got to
[1:32:01] hanging around certain people and they
[1:32:03] and around certain Ministries and they
[1:32:04] told her that that you was a liar and
[1:32:07] and she be to doubt you he said though
[1:32:09] the prophecy was a
[1:32:12] prophecy that woman was 52 years old and
[1:32:15] she gave birth to a 12 lb
[1:32:20] boy it's a big prophecy
[1:32:27] what are you saying I'm saying if God
[1:32:29] said it no matter what the scoffers do
[1:32:31] and no matter what they
[1:32:38] say well Glory
[1:32:42] Glory well
[1:32:43] [Music]
[1:32:45] [Applause]
[1:32:47] Hallelujah you're getting in Bride
[1:32:49] material then when you start isolating
[1:32:52] yourself
[1:33:00] well I still got preaching
[1:33:02] time praise
[1:33:08] God when this
[1:33:10] star begin to line
[1:33:12] up sham ham and J all of it begin to
[1:33:16] come
[1:33:18] together these three wise men start
[1:33:20] seeing the
[1:33:22] star brother brand in question answers
[1:33:25] he he begin to talk to us in 1960 he be
[1:33:28] to talk to us and he he tell us he said
[1:33:30] now he said in that time he said now who
[1:33:32] was that Earthly star he said it was
[1:33:35] John the Baptist he said now the star he
[1:33:37] said the star does not reflect its own
[1:33:39] light he said but the star is reflecting
[1:33:41] the light of that sun and he said when
[1:33:43] John the Baptist was come there he began
[1:33:45] to he began to move into himself he
[1:33:47] began to move in his ministry and he
[1:33:49] begin to reflect that light reflect that
[1:33:52] light of where and all all of a sudden
[1:33:54] because he begin to step into his
[1:33:56] ministry but it caused an expectation
[1:33:59] and the Book of Luke said it that when
[1:34:01] when John was up there on the banks of
[1:34:03] the Jordan River that the Pharisees and
[1:34:05] the Sanhedrin came in there and they
[1:34:08] started to ask
[1:34:09] him the Bible said that they begin to
[1:34:12] Muse in their heart that word muse if
[1:34:15] you studied out in the Greek it means to
[1:34:17] be absorbed with a thought that these
[1:34:21] men begin to be absorbed with a thought
[1:34:24] are you the Messiah are you the king
[1:34:27] they begin to ponder these things they
[1:34:28] begin to look at it with with a great
[1:34:30] intent with reasoning in their mind they
[1:34:33] begin to ask him are you
[1:34:35] he are we looking for another he said
[1:34:37] now look I'm going to baptize you with
[1:34:39] water but the one that's coming after me
[1:34:42] he's going to baptize you with fire and
[1:34:45] the Holy Ghost you see I got to decrease
[1:34:48] so that he can
[1:34:51] increase excuse me and brother Mar said
[1:34:53] that when John standing there he's
[1:34:55] standing on the banks of Jordan River
[1:34:57] and he starts proclaiming he starts
[1:34:59] proclaiming that he's a voice in the
[1:35:01] wilderness he's crying and brother
[1:35:03] random said it like this that it began
[1:35:05] to stir the whole world because John was
[1:35:09] preaching a true gospel he was preaching
[1:35:11] repentance and he was preaching he was
[1:35:13] preaching that the coming of the Lord
[1:35:15] was coming and he began to stir all that
[1:35:17] region you imagine whenever a light
[1:35:20] shows up whenever a star shows up it
[1:35:23] begins to it begins to cause an
[1:35:25] attraction and it stirred the San hedrin
[1:35:27] when the madb was looking for it and it
[1:35:29] stirred Jerusalem when John the Baptist
[1:35:31] was pointing to somebody greater than
[1:35:33] him and he started pointing to it and it
[1:35:36] stirred all the world you see something
[1:35:40] caught the attention just like the light
[1:35:43] struck that
[1:35:45] lens that light be to strike that seed
[1:35:48] that was on the inside of John the
[1:35:49] Baptist and it started to come to
[1:35:50] fruition everything that John was if it
[1:35:53] was P it was passion it was it was it
[1:35:56] was full of honor it was full of it was
[1:35:58] full of promises it was full of it was
[1:36:00] full of allmighty God and the people
[1:36:04] begin to
[1:36:05] look now if if this is Malachi
[1:36:09] 3 then
[1:36:12] surely we can start looking for Isaiah
[1:36:16] 7:14 if he's going to be the
[1:36:19] Forerunner then there's got to be
[1:36:21] somebody coming after him
[1:36:24] so they begin to look for
[1:36:25] him they begin to Muse in their
[1:36:30] heart now let me just go a little bit
[1:36:33] further if this is Malachi
[1:36:37] 4 then there's got to be somebody
[1:36:40] here if he if Malachi 4 had to decrease
[1:36:45] then somebody's here that that
[1:36:47] increased so if if if this is the
[1:36:49] ministry of Malachi
[1:36:51] 4 if this is him
[1:36:54] then it's a sure sign that the king is
[1:36:57] here so William brandom's Ministry
[1:37:00] though it might have seemed very humble
[1:37:02] in his in its beginnings and it started
[1:37:05] out just like a Kentucky hillbilly he
[1:37:07] couldn't say his words right and they
[1:37:09] made fun of him for saying Pulpit
[1:37:12] instead of ppit I started making fun of
[1:37:15] him that he didn't have the right kind
[1:37:16] of grammar and I'll tell you this you
[1:37:19] know none of that grammar ever bothered
[1:37:21] me
[1:37:24] it bothered a lot of people because it
[1:37:27] stirred the world to said well he ain't
[1:37:29] got the right kind of education he ain't
[1:37:31] got the ain't got the right kind of
[1:37:32] grammar to be able to speak to the high
[1:37:34] INF flutin that were really wanting to
[1:37:36] get but it didn't never affect
[1:37:38] you why because you see it stirred
[1:37:41] something on the inside of them that was
[1:37:44] Envy but it stirred a predestinated seed
[1:37:47] on the inside of you that light struck
[1:37:50] that lens but William brandom said that
[1:37:53] and the light struck that predestinated
[1:37:56] seed that was placed on the book that
[1:37:59] your name was wrote before the
[1:38:00] foundation of the world he said it
[1:38:02] struck that seed and it come to life he
[1:38:05] said just like that little bitty old
[1:38:07] woman that was a prostitute he said he
[1:38:11] said the light struck that seed I love
[1:38:15] what brother Bron said even in her
[1:38:19] condition
[1:38:20] right even in her condition
[1:38:28] even in her condition the light struck
[1:38:30] the seed and brother Ram said I love I
[1:38:33] love this message brother Ram said that
[1:38:35] when he began to talk to her and tell
[1:38:38] her about her condition tell about her
[1:38:40] husband brother forgive
[1:38:42] me brother random said he didn't have to
[1:38:45] say another
[1:38:47] word he didn't have to do another thing
[1:38:50] and all of a sudden she dropped her
[1:38:51] water pot and she said come see a man
[1:38:55] and all of a sudden that woman stirred
[1:38:58] the entire Community the light struck
[1:39:01] that seed the light struck that lens and
[1:39:04] the light has struck this generation
[1:39:06] whenever a star shows
[1:39:09] up this seven star that showed up in
[1:39:12] this generation has caused an attraction
[1:39:15] but it's also caused a
[1:39:18] stirring Don't Go Near there Don't Go
[1:39:20] Near That William brandom he gets off in
[1:39:22] the he gets off in the last part of his
[1:39:24] ministry don't you go near him he he
[1:39:26] does all right while he's under the
[1:39:28] anointing but let him get outside of
[1:39:30] that I don't know I don't know whether
[1:39:32] he is or not but you know the Cry of
[1:39:36] every every heart of every believer is
[1:39:39] they want the real Holy Spirit
[1:39:48] now let me get to it that's a cry let me
[1:39:53] get to that real holy spirit that fell
[1:39:55] on the day of Pentecost we read it in
[1:39:58] the Bible where is Jesus the same
[1:39:59] yesterday and today forever where is it
[1:40:02] we read that he's a great healer where
[1:40:04] is it we read that the holy spirit is
[1:40:06] for you and for your children and to
[1:40:07] them that's a far off even as many as
[1:40:09] the Lord Our God should call where is it
[1:40:11] in our churches where is that power that
[1:40:14] sets a church of fire that makes them
[1:40:16] turn off the television on Wednesday
[1:40:18] night and go to church where is that
[1:40:21] power that makes our ladies dress like
[1:40:22] women where is that power that sets a
[1:40:25] soul so on fire that he's out there on
[1:40:28] the field and he's constantly testifying
[1:40:30] to the glory of
[1:40:32] God that power is here that anointing is
[1:40:36] here this is more than just an anointing
[1:40:38] of Acts two but this the anointing of
[1:40:40] Acts 2 and Revelations chapter 10 you
[1:40:43] are under a dual anointing you are
[1:40:48] here the king is
[1:40:51] here I was going to hold this for next
[1:40:54] weekend but we're in a
[1:40:58] moment forgive
[1:41:05] me you see when the king is on his
[1:41:07] throne you can say surely the Lord is my
[1:41:10] shepherd beside me are still waters
[1:41:13] beneath me are Green Pastures before me
[1:41:15] is a table prepared between me and my
[1:41:18] home lies the Valley of the shadow of
[1:41:20] death behind me is goodness and mercy
[1:41:23] and in the distance awaits me the house
[1:41:25] of the Lord forever when God is your
[1:41:28] light you will Proclaim him as Savior
[1:41:31] and Lord you will bow on your knees and
[1:41:33] you will cry holy holy holy you will
[1:41:36] reverence him for he is unmatched in all
[1:41:39] of his power you will love him for his
[1:41:41] infinite wisdom you will trust him for
[1:41:44] his abundant goodness you will praise
[1:41:46] him for his overwhelming greatness you
[1:41:49] will believe in him for his unwavering
[1:41:51] faithfulness you will adore for him for
[1:41:54] he is perfect in
[1:41:57] Holiness the king is
[1:42:12] here they didn't catch
[1:42:15] it it stirred every
[1:42:17] rank of the religions of the
[1:42:20] world but it didn't shake them
[1:42:25] they thought he was coming for their
[1:42:27] King thought he was coming for their
[1:42:30] throne but this King was coming for a
[1:42:32] different
[1:42:35] Throne he was coming for your
[1:42:40] heart so King Herod wouldn't accept
[1:42:44] him the Sanhedrin rejected him but
[1:42:48] Shepherds received
[1:42:50] him because he could know that would say
[1:42:53] the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not
[1:42:58] want this light that has been leading
[1:43:00] you it's not some ordinary
[1:43:02] light it's a lot of a
[1:43:07] king what would this lamp if it was
[1:43:10] getting if it was reflecting if it's
[1:43:12] going to reflect something it's
[1:43:14] reflecting the shik
[1:43:16] glory if it's coming from the shalana
[1:43:19] glory then it's got to reflect the shik
[1:43:21] glory if the light that is leading you
[1:43:24] is coming from a seminary then your
[1:43:26] light's going to reflect a seminary
[1:43:28] light if you got it in a Methodist
[1:43:30] Seminary you're going to reflect
[1:43:33] methodism if you got it in the
[1:43:35] Pentecostal Seminary you're going to
[1:43:37] reflect
[1:43:38] Pentecostalism but if you got it in the
[1:43:40] glory of God by the burning bush then
[1:43:43] you're going to reflect the burning
[1:43:45] bush the scriptures kept pointing that
[1:43:49] he is coming that he's coming and it
[1:43:52] calls
[1:43:53] anticipation that he was coming through
[1:43:55] the line of the tribe of Judah you see
[1:43:58] Moses spoke of it Micah spoke of it
[1:44:01] Matthew spoke of it Paul spoke of it
[1:44:04] John the Revelator spoke of it that he
[1:44:06] was coming as the lion of the tribe of
[1:44:09] Judah and William brandham said you are
[1:44:12] not into to an angel because God is
[1:44:15] requiring his Law requires a kinsman
[1:44:19] redeemer he said you're not kin to an
[1:44:21] angel he said but you you are kin to the
[1:44:24] line of the tribe of Judah what gives
[1:44:27] you the tenacity to stand here in the
[1:44:29] gates of hell it's because you are kin
[1:44:32] to the line of the tribe of Judah and
[1:44:35] you have a sternness in your life you
[1:44:37] have a firmness in your heart you have a
[1:44:40] bravery in your soul because you are kin
[1:44:43] to the lion of the tribe of
[1:44:50] Judah brother brandom goes on to say in
[1:44:53] the adoption series tell me my brother
[1:44:57] tell me my sister when was the time that
[1:45:00] the sons of God was ever going to be
[1:45:02] manifested outside of this time right
[1:45:05] now when was there ever a time in
[1:45:07] history that manifested time to deliver
[1:45:10] on nature nature itself is groaning it's
[1:45:14] waiting for the time of manifestation
[1:45:16] why before the atonement was made before
[1:45:18] the Holy Ghost was ever poured out
[1:45:20] before the Old Testament on down there
[1:45:22] there could have couldn't have not been
[1:45:24] a manifestation it had to wait till this
[1:45:27] time now all things has been brought
[1:45:30] coming shaping up to a headstone to the
[1:45:33] manifestation of the sons of God coming
[1:45:35] back and the spirit of God coming into
[1:45:37] these men so perfectly until their
[1:45:40] ministry will be so close like Christ
[1:45:44] till it'll join him and his church
[1:45:50] together what is that Ministry
[1:45:54] when a little bitty old girl that had Al
[1:45:56] Capia that the ministry of Tim PR would
[1:45:59] stand there and say we are here to
[1:46:01] restore the glory of almighty God back
[1:46:04] to that little girl it was the
[1:46:07] manifestation of the king and the queen
[1:46:11] coming together what was it when when
[1:46:18] when when Doug Hill was sitting here and
[1:46:21] he died in a service much like this all
[1:46:24] of a sudden the king's Ministry and the
[1:46:26] Queen's Ministry come together and it
[1:46:29] was a
[1:46:31] manifestation what was
[1:46:33] it when Connie Mays was watching a
[1:46:37] stream and all of a sudden she felt so
[1:46:39] pulled when a man from Louisiana was
[1:46:42] preaching a message and she said I got
[1:46:44] to get in that building was that Aaron
[1:46:46] oglesby's Ministry or was that the
[1:46:49] king's Ministry
[1:46:53] come on
[1:46:54] somebody
[1:46:55] hallelujah
[1:46:57] hallelujah what was it what was it that
[1:47:01] turned my wife's womb when she couldn't
[1:47:03] have children but all of a sudden the
[1:47:06] king's Ministry come in line with the
[1:47:08] Queen's
[1:47:10] Ministry what was it when Dave Breeden
[1:47:13] was so wrecked up all of a sudden the
[1:47:15] king's Ministry and the Queen's Ministry
[1:47:18] tied together and you saw the physical
[1:47:21] manifestation of the
[1:47:24] king
[1:47:26] hallelujah how about every one of you
[1:47:28] that was backsliding on God you got cold
[1:47:31] on God you done gave up on God but the
[1:47:34] king's
[1:47:37] Ministry but the king's Ministry started
[1:47:40] working through an eve that would not
[1:47:42] fail that would not give up you are
[1:47:45] predestinated to live out this hour

[1:48:00] by the name of Ern Baxter I'm coming to
[1:48:02] this very special moment and I want your
[1:48:06] expectations to come to a heighten now
[1:48:07] I'm coming to I'm coming to the climax
[1:48:10] just
[1:48:11] now ER bter is with brother
[1:48:15] brandom and all of a sudden Ern backer
[1:48:18] Ern bter and William Brandon may see a
[1:48:21] man that's going down the street and er
[1:48:23] Baxter turns to William brandom he
[1:48:25] starts crying and weeping and throws his
[1:48:27] arm around William William brandom
[1:48:29] William brandom said what's all the fuss
[1:48:31] brother ER he said you see that's my
[1:48:34] king he said here he was ER baxer was a
[1:48:37] c was a Canadian he said if a Canadian
[1:48:40] could act that kind of way could act
[1:48:42] that kind of way about a natural King
[1:48:45] how much more his sons and daughters of
[1:48:48] God come on somebody he was God for
[1:48:51] Mariah proit that was nobody that wasn't

[1:48:58] that raised Ron Spencer out of the
[1:49:00] hospital when he broke every vertebrae

[1:49:27] very plain with you when she would eat
[1:49:29] she would get sick to her stomach and
[1:49:31] lose everything she ate but all of a
[1:49:34] sudden the king came in a
[1:49:36] tent and he manifested his
[1:49:41] glory who was it that night then Doug
