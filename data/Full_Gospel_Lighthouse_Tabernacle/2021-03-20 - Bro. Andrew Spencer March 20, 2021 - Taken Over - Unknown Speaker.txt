========================================

[Music] 11th chapter of hebrews which gives the heroes of faith by faith moses by faith abraham bob faith enoch by faith noah all the great heroes of faith and saying seeing that we are compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin the unbelief that does so easily beset us here we are tonight right in the shadows of the coming of the son of god and yet we find the church in anemic condition we ought to be great strong mighty warriors of faith that would shake a nation god gives it to us we would just receive it so these old things upon us that hold us back from running let's lay aside all those little weights down because we're looking to the author and finisher of our faith jesus christ who was made man on earth and dwelt among us and has made sin that through his righteousness we might be forgiven of our sins he became us sinners that we might become his righteousness in other words like this he become me that i might become him he was the son of god i was a sinner he taken my praise become a sinner i might be a son of god and when we see that in order to attract the attention of every man and woman to lay aside everyone's skeptic talks oh i love that they'll some little something come up that we said well i never heard of that before search it out in the scripture if it's a bible stay with it you people you're noted for your great delicious apples raised in the valley here and other fruits when you set that little tree out a little larger than that just a little slip every apple is able to be in that trees in it right there so it is if it doesn't where does it come from it's in the tree and you plant the tree in the ground you irrigate it put water on it what does that little tree do it grows and why it grows it drinks and draws from the earth water it draws more than its potion more than enough to fill it it draws it so much until it pushes out limbs branches apples then goes down and hides through the winter time keeps the sap from being killed in the tree what intelligence runs it down into the ground hides it through the winter put a water in a tan cup and set it on the fence and see if it'll go down when winter time comes certainly it won't some intelligence runs it down that same intelligence that runs the water in there is the same spirit of god has got us together for this convention the same spirit that's bringing us together here under the heavenly places in christ jesus to find his goodness and mercy for the hours that lays ahead of real us is now we find that in this little tree it pushes out when it grows it pushes out and when you are born into the kingdom of god just a little baby in christ everything that you have needed in this life's journey is in you when you receive the holy spirit oh then what you have to do is drink and drink and keep on drinking don't you stop when you join church and are baptized just keep drinking until you have faith for this and faith for

asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen romans chapter 6 and verse 12. romans chapter 6 and verse 12 and say amen when you have it this evening amen let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but unto grace what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid know ye not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey his servants are ye to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin ye became the servants of righteousness god bless his word he may be seated tonight in the presence of the lord i'd like to take from these scriptures a thought on taken taken over and if you go to looking at that word taken it means to be received it means to it means to be caught taken it means to be apprehended and captivated and you can look at those words and synonyms of that word taken it means to be it means to be captivated it means to be possessed or controlled or empowered by when someone has taken over they're taken over by maybe we would say maybe as christians or people that we're affiliated with we would say that that person is is empowered or taken over by the holy spirit and that person is possessed and there's certain there's certain things that you've been around in your life and there's just certain people that you're acquainted with and that you just there's certain people that have an atmosphere about them that you just absolutely love to be around them you could you could be around them all day long and not be tired of then there's certain people that you couldn't be around them fi you don't want to be around them five minutes it's just something about them that's it's it's a spirit that they carry it's something that that makes the spirit of the living god that's living on the inside of you uneasy and it doesn't make you feel comfortable and and then there there there are people that carry spirits maybe carry a spirit of depression or or anxiety but then there's even going down into a deeper realm there's there is demon possession that that that takes over a person and and if you've ever been around somebody that's been demon possessed they that person it's not the person themselves that makes them do that it's that spirit that's that's dwelling there that's so controlling them and taking over their body that that they can't even they can't even control themselves but yet we can also look at it as as a as a holy possession and we can see that there is a people on earth and we're living in a day like we've never lived before where god is empowering a body that is that is so under the control of the holy ghost that he's taking over ownership in their life and and they are they're watching the god of the bible become the god of their heart and when the god of the bible becomes the god of your heart you will see that this message is vindicated and you'll see that this message is absolutely the truth when you get took over by the power of the living god and you can see that that that person is totally committed and and totally taken over by that spirit of god when you see somebody you just love to be around them when they've got that same atmosphere when you go to reading about jesus of the bible and you get to deal and maybe you get to hanging out with brother nathaniel or you get to hanging out with brother donny and you'll recognize that the same life that you read in the book of the bible when you look through the four gospels that you'll see that that same spirit is living on the inside of that person and you'll watch that they got the same mannerisms they've got the same characteristics they've got the same love that jesus had the same atmosphere that jesus had it makes you long to be in his spirit and really if you are not possessed with his spirit or fully taken over and baptized with the spirit it makes you long it makes you long to get that way if you ever been around if you ever been around somebody and you you've been around somebody you just you get so infatuated with a thought man i just love to be that way i just love to have that kind of atmosphere and you know i have to say it to you tonight maybe you're maybe you're thinking that but you can have that same spirit you can have that same token life of jesus christ and it can so embody you and take over your life we know that we're built to be the temple of god a place that that god wants to dwell out a place where god wants to come and dwell by his holy spirit but we know that by the fall of humanity that we were born in sin we were we were shaped in iniquity and we we come into this world and we said things that weren't right nobody had to teach your children how to lie none of you parents stood out and made made a point in your life to teach your children how to tell a little fib but yet something on the inside of them wants to deny that they took that cookie out of the cookie jar you see it but it's it's what they were born under we were born in sin we were shaped in iniquity and and here we are because of our first birth we carry these characteristics but there can be a change in all of that there can be a change and maybe you were born in this world and you came into this world and you spoke lies and you've done awful deeds and you and you run around and you did all kinds of ungodly things but i want to say this loud and clear you never were the devil's property you may have done things wrong you may have said things wrong you may have acted wrong you may even went out and drunk something that was wrong but you were never the devil's property he never had a claim on you he never will have a claim on you you see before the foundation of the world you were already in god's mind and if you were in god's mind you could never be the devil's property you may have acted like a devil you may sometimes even look like a devil but you never were a devil if you are a daughter of god if you are a son of god you were never a twofold child of hell you were already a son of god you just didn't realize it yet but you remember the day that all of a sudden something happened to you that all of a sudden there became that first birth began to just shed way and you begin to morph into the person that god called you to be and it was like god deposited something on the inside of you you couldn't make it up you couldn't make yourself live right you couldn't make yourself dance you couldn't make yourself get emotional about religious things but something was deposited on the inside of you and you just walked into it you just stepped right into that realm because you were born for that realm are you with me you see the title deed to the earth and to eternal life when when adam forfeited it then satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to the original owner god himself so when satan wanted to put his clamps on your life mercy said no when satan was doing his absolute best to call you his and claim you as his and claim this earth and claim the possession of god almighty god said there's not a chance that i'm gonna let you lay your hands on my children you are so important that all the way back in the garden of heath god had already seen a lamb dying for you and though satan didn't have the vision real clear but two thousand four thousand years later there came a man that walked on the shores of galilee and john the baptist said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world satan was getting a vision of what was coming to pass what god was talking about back there in the beginning this is the seat of the woman you see the fallen condition of humanity had to be rightfully restored we all enjoy we all enjoy watching as as older cars come into full restoration there's nothing like seeing a 67 and a 69 camaro that's been all rusted up and set in a garage somewhere and nobody's put no put no love on it but all of a sudden somebody decides they want to put a little tlc on that thing and they want to build that thing back to its originality and they're grabbing parts from here and they're grabbing parts from there and it's all got to be original you see what they're doing is they're restoring that car back to its first estate and they're wanting it to look just like it did in the beginning and just maybe maybe you've read stories about about coins that had been lost in the sea and they had been they've been under salt water for so many years and they and they change it change their characteristics it had rusted it up and it made it it made it look like it made it even look like it wasn't even valuable but somebody that is called or deemed a restorer takes that valuable coin and they start putting it through a restoration process and they start bringing out the beauty of it now maybe in your condition or looking at its first estate you wouldn't have gave a nickel for it but when it went through the restoration process then it's worth millions of dollars you see at a point in your life you didn't look like your life was worth a nickel but then when you come to the other side of things you found out that you was worth 10 million worlds you see somebody was willing to be deemed the restoration of a broad tree and put her right back in her order again and finally we are seeing that the fruit is at the top of the tree again and the same life that was put in the first tree is now in the bride tree you see the restore is to bring it back to who it really owns it or to bring it back to its natural state where was it the first time to bring it back to its natural condition but in order to do this we have a right to enforce if there's a law to enforce this rightful condition of restoration to restore like if somebody stole some property or they're holding the property captive then you can take the law and go to this person and the law enforces it this person to restore the property back to its natural owner and back to its first estate you see you always were his children i don't want you to hear me he's always had you in his hands he's always had you in his hands and maybe you haven't recognized what is going on right here but redemption is at work and god is saying i brought you back for this i bought you for this purpose i redeemed you because you're of value to me you see if you were not no value of god you'd never be sitting here if you were not no value to to him he would have never spent his life for you but what did he do he redeemed you he brought you back he redeemed your soul from hell he redeemed and brought back everything that adam lost when he satan put you in the pawn shop and jesus christ on calvary was your kinsman redeemer that redeemed you from every curse of the devil he redeemed your soul he redeemed your sick body he redeems your weary and dreary spirit he brought you happiness somebody said he brought me happiness he brought you joy that's what redemption brought you he brought you peace he brought you longsuffering he brought you goodness that's what jesus brought you he brought you goodness he brought you gentleness he brought you meekness he brought you the holy spirit he brought you divine healing all these things jesus christ brought you because he was our kinsmen redeemer and people walk around with their head hung down in the mud and when you look at somebody like that you can see where they've had their head because their head is full of dirt but if you could just lift your head just for a moment brother andrew wants to tell you he brought you joy he brought you peace he brought you happiness he brought you divine healing he brought you miracles hallelujah he brought you to this spot because he thought that you were worth his own life you could you can look at your life and think it's miserable you can think it's your you can look at your life and think it's worth throwing away but god thinks differently you think well i'm just going to end my life and i'm going to take this last pill and throw it away i got something different for you i got a pill that'll change your life i got to peel if you'll swallow this pill it'll make you a new person wrapped up on the inside of this pill it'll give you healing in your body it'll give your deliverance in your soul it'll bring your wealth like never been told because the god that i'm talking about if you'll swallow this pill he owns the cattle on a thousand hills it's not a pill that'll kill you but it's a pill that'll mortify the deeds of your flesh it's a pill and it's called the gospel and all you got to do is swallow it just get you a good dose of holy water and take this gospel it'll wash out all the sin it'll wash out all the mistakes you remember you remember when you go to reading over in the old testament you go to read them back to birthright you remember that little story that the prophet would tell us about that cross-eyed mule how he was born there how he was born he had cross-eyed and his knees all flopped his ears all flopped back and his knees were knocked and he began to tell his mama he said mama he said if the master of the house ever sees me cross out in this condition knock kneed in this condition he said if the master sees me if he sees me he's going to knock me in the head and kill me she began to tell him said honey let me tell you something the master ain't even looking at you the master ain't even looking at you you see that priest out there is looking for a blood or looking for a for a lamb without blemish he's looking for a lamb that's without a spot so the master can't even see you when that when that priest walked out there and took that lamb he was not looking at you he was looking at that lamb son you were born under birthright the master can't kill you can't you see what jacob would fight for the birthright hallelujah it made him in possession of everything that isaac owned oh hallelujah can't you see why you got to be birthed right it puts you in possession of everything that jesus owns hallelujah there's something laying on the inside of you that maybe the world can't see there's life laying there he hath made us kings and priests him being the great messiah has made us messiahs something laying there son of man's there and he's working and speaking through your life something's laying there brother denny something's laying there that's wanting cause to cause you to come closer if you ever go to looking at a picture go looking at that picture and you're staring at it and you're studying the characteristics of it you're trying to catch the details of the picture and you can't see it from a very far off so you got to draw closer to it and everybody is always oohing and awing over the picture how they caught this person in the right element they caught them in this position they they caught them in their trueness this if there's ever been a picture that was ever taken this describes this person everybody always oohs and awes over the picture but they make they take no credit or they don't take in to consideration the person that took the picture are you with me you don't take into consideration the one that took the picture you see now your your picture was taken before the foundation of the world and when you when the angels of god go to looking at your picture and they go to looking at man if there ever was a son oh hallelujah brother jim noel that's a real son right there oh if you could just they really caught him whoever took this picture caught him in his true element of who he is and then god speaks up i'm the one that took the picture taken into consideration who picked out you before the foundation of the world it was not satan it was not your mama it was not your daddy take into consideration the one that took your picture before the foundation of the world don't you get shook up on your matters of life on your circumstances and your situations your picture was took before the foundation of the world and it may take you a long time to get to that spot but you're going to look like that picture you might have to go through some mud you might have to go through some goalie washers but you're going to look like that picture i'm happy to say that there's a whole gang of y'alls pictures a whole gang of them down there in the post office of hell are you with me you remember you used to go in the post office and you look on the post office wall and it would say want it want it for larceny wanted for arsony wanted for this i'd say there's a whole gang of pictures of the bride of jesus christ wanted for living right wanted for worshiping one and for the holy ghost wanted for believing when they shouldn't have believed warn it won't it oh hallelujah what happened to you you were taken over when the queen of sheba when she began to hear the fame of solomon something began to take over her she began to hear about the name of the lord and how god was doing these miraculous things through his servant solomon and she went hundreds of miles just because of a story just because of what somebody was saying just because of what what they were saying about solomon that he knows all the secrets of the heart that god has given him a wisdom and she packs up her train and she takes off she's making this journey for miles and miles what's going on here she is taken over by the thought that there's a man that can answer the secrets of my heart when you're looking for answers had a list of answers in your pocket had them right there in your heart and you were asking god is this the truth is this the truth i need some answers here if this is really happening if there's real still miracles in 2021 if there's some real things still happening i need some answers about these things and the queen of the south went all the way out to there and she's carrying merge she's carrying spices she's carrying gold and she's carrying silver but she's not concerned with the thought of ishmael's sons running out there and trying to kill her she is totally captivated with the thought that there is a man that can tell me the secrets of my heart she had all of these goods all of these treasures but she was so she was under the influence of something she was so taken over that i've got to get there she didn't let the thought of robbers come in to stop her she rode out there on camels she didn't ride out there in a nice cadillac she rode out there because something was taking over her thought she didn't know if she'd walk away with them she didn't know but she was willing to go all the way she was willing to go all the miles just to get close to him just to get there and if you could imagine tonight if something that same something would get a hold of you well i came all the way from grotto's all right i came all the way from lexington i came all the way from over the mountain if you'd come with the same something that was leading the queen of the south all the way through those miles you would walk away from here tonight with a different outlook that there is a fame of the lord jesus christ down there at full gospel lighthouse it's more than just on the stream and it's more than just what people have posted on facebook there's a living god down there [Applause] oh hallelujah [Applause] you could come in here in a wheelchair you could come in here sick you could come in here and die straights but there's a man here that can tell you the very secrets of his heart he's the same yesterday today and forever he's not changing and he won't change he'll tell you if the doctrine's right he'll tell you if your dress is right he'll tell if your mind is right he'll tell you what spirit you're of if that something could get a hold of you you can't do it until he gets a hold of you the devil would like to implant in your mind that you were his and you always were his and he's got claims on you that's a lie that came straight from the pits of hell you can leave him you can leave that lie right there where hell where it came from you were not a twofold child of hell because the bible says that as many as are led by the spirit they are the sons of god for you've not received the spirit of bondage again of fear but you receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry of a father the spirit itself itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children than heirs heirs of god and join us with christ if so be that we suffer with him that may we be also glorified together you see if your heart and your mind is so enfilled with god's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts there you are when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the holy spirit that's moving your mortal being what kind of people should we be if the very holy spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts that you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion but the holy spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is god's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of church would we be when's the last time you let yourself get good and took over by the holy ghost come on somebody when's the last time when you got yourself so far into the worship that you lost sight to everything that you walked in with but you begin to break out in worship when the piano wasn't going and the organ wasn't humming out and the song leader wasn't even singing but you were in a realm of worship oh and you broke into a worship and there was nobody else singing maybe somebody else around you they were looking around looking and see if little johnny was here or little susie was here but you were so caught up in worship that you didn't care who was here and you didn't care who wasn't here but you were caught up in the worship you were taken over by a worship when's the last time that you've turned your face towards his holy hill and you started worshiping when's the last time you got good and took over and you got good and drunk on the holy ghost what kind of people would we be if we turn ourselves loose to this kind of that turn ourselves loose to this kind of worship what kind of church would full gospel lighthouse be if we went far enough into our worship far enough into our prayer fire enough into our praise you say well i'm afraid that a little fire might break out or a little wildfire would break out and somebody may not really get it but somebody else might and i don't know which one to have it or not i'd rather have a little wildfire and no fire at all [Applause] when's the last time that you broke into prayer and you started speaking in tongues when's the last time when you come out of prayer and everybody look clean when's the last time when you went far enough in that you forgot about your pain when's the last time you went far enough in that you forgot about your circumstance are you hearing me tonight when's the last time when you really prayed through when's the last time that you asked for the holy ghost well i just keep falling i just keep getting in trouble when's the last time that you really fell in love with jesus you fall in love with jesus you won't fall out of love with jesus you got to get yourself in you got to really get persuaded you got to get took over that it's no longer your thinking but it's his thinking i'm not asking for your amens tonight i'm asking have you went far enough in that you forgot how loud i was preaching have you went far enough in that you forgot who was sitting around you after you went far enough in that you forgot the sin that you committed yesterday on somebody it's hard to worship god when you wake up in the bed with the devil have you went far enough in come on somebody have you went far enough in till you lose sight of everybody come on somebody have you went far enough into this message that it was no longer about william branham but it was about you come on somebody have you went far enough in that is no longer just about ron spencer's miracle but it's about your miracle have you went far enough in where it ain't just about the people on the front view but it's the people on the internet have you got a love for everybody around you that you want to see them so filled with the holy ghost have you went that far enough in what kind of church would we be well i got to get home you have no idea i've got certain things set on my well they call them recorders there you go don't even know what it's called i got certain things that i'm going to watch on there and i'm going to make myself a sandwich after a while and i'm gonna set my rear end down right there and i'm gonna watch it but you keep on preaching so i'll just set on you i'll tell you what your trouble is you ain't went far enough in but if you get far enough in you don't care what's on the tube you don't care what's on youtube you don't care what's on facebook if you get far enough in you won't care about falling out oh how would god that somebody go into a worship go into a praise go in far enough there was a little boy there's a little boy one time in the house he lived in little boy's bedroom was upstairs and the mama would take take the little boy upstairs and put him in bed every night well about two o'clock in the morning little billy little billy fell out to bed and all mama heard was cle plunk she run up the stairs billy are you okay mama i fell out the bed so she tucks billy back up in the bed puts him up in there then next night she goes and puts little billy back in his bed again about two o'clock in the morning she heard a plunk she runs upstairs and barely are you okay mama i fell out to bed again well the next night she hears the same things and runs up the stairs runs up the stairs said billy are you okay he said mama i fell out the bed but i sure wish you'd fix this could you fix it where i don't fall out she said yes honey it's real simple you just never got far enough in you see if you get far enough in you wouldn't be worried about falling out if you got yourself good far enough in on the inside of this word you wouldn't be worried about what everything else is around you you'd be wrapped up tied up tangled up in jesus you'd be so enveloped in the word of almighty god that you would know that you ain't gonna fall out oh hallelujah oh something's gonna happen in this place tonight some gonna break loose in this place tonight because somebody is willing to push past you're willing to push past your own emotions for a moment you see there's a little something that every preacher deals with they got their own little things he maybe we would even call it a complex if that preacher could get past himself because every whether you know this or not some of them you may not i hate hearing the sound of my voice i hate i hate how loud i get i hate how i move i wish i could stand still no i don't really don't but i wish i wish that i wouldn't flop my hands everywhere you see and those are personal things that i battle and i'm telling you something and i've never told anybody else because i'm trying to get you to something because i realize that if i can push past myself and i can get so took over by the holy ghost there's something here i want you to notice that i can never do this without him i cannot preach without him i cannot talk without him i cannot live right without him there was a preacher one time that said i can do without the anointing for a while but every once in a while i need it i can't walk across the street without him but if i can get to a point where i can get so anointed and so took over i don't care how loud i preach i don't care how i flop my hands i don't care what my voice says what it sounds like let me squeak let me holler but if jesus comes through let me push past my own self if i can push past myself maybe somebody will get so loose and so drunk on the holy ghost that they'll break loose in worship [Applause] oh let freedom ring there's power in your worship there's power and your freedom to worship stand with me i'll just go to speaking him hallelujah hallelujah his presence is essential for the supernatural you might ask why i just stopped because he's here he's here and if you can go to cutting yourself loose to praising him just for a moment hallelujah just cut yourself loose to worship in him he's here to bless you satan is defeated satan is a liar satan has been conquered and satan is trying to keep the blessings from the people but god's here to make sure you get
