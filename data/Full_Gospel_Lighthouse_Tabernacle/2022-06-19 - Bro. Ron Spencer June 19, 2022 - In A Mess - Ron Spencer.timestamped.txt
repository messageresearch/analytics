[1:04:38] amen brother andrew will be speaking for
[1:04:40] us next weekend saturday and sunday
[1:04:43] night and so
[1:04:44] i just want to say something for our
[1:04:46] newer ones that are among us here
[1:04:48] brother rogers so good to have you again
[1:04:50] two sundays in a row we're we're getting
[1:04:53] we're going to change bodies here so you
[1:04:55] just hang with us and
[1:04:57] i want to say something for the for the
[1:04:59] public as far as
[1:05:01] as far as even on the internet you know
[1:05:03] in churches we're getting to the spot
[1:05:05] when we're starting to have our 50th
[1:05:07] anniversary ministries begin to get
[1:05:09] older
[1:05:10] and brother joe was here last night and
[1:05:13] they had to transition a couple of times
[1:05:15] brother henry greene was the founder of
[1:05:17] the church then brother dan daisley who
[1:05:20] was the associate pastor for all of
[1:05:22] those years
[1:05:23] since the very beginning of time then
[1:05:26] brother joe came along and it's not just
[1:05:28] succession to worry that you pick a man
[1:05:31] and he goes
[1:05:32] because that's the way the nominationals
[1:05:34] do it and so god has to raise up a man
[1:05:37] god god raises up a man we can we can
[1:05:40] see god raise up men and
[1:05:42] too many times that is squashed but when
[1:05:45] god raises up a man god uses that man
[1:05:49] maybe to help that local assembly
[1:05:52] and uh just andrew so happens to be our
[1:05:54] our our associate pastor and now our
[1:05:57] pastor with us and and we're we're we're
[1:06:00] kind of a strange sordid team here and i
[1:06:02] want to explain that just a little bit
[1:06:04] for the newer ones that are here when we
[1:06:06] started our journey
[1:06:09] this is a kind of a neat thing
[1:06:11] when we started our journey
[1:06:13] before the journey even started
[1:06:16] at communion
[1:06:17] we elected andrew as our next pastor
[1:06:21] and so that was about two years ago
[1:06:24] and so we've watched that we've watched
[1:06:26] him grow we've watched him in his
[1:06:28] maturity of the word
[1:06:31] every every service he only gets better
[1:06:33] but god did that
[1:06:37] i shouldn't didn't do it i i now i want
[1:06:39] to be a mentor to him and i want to
[1:06:41] coach him and i will coach him and i
[1:06:43] will stomp my foot at him
[1:06:45] but
[1:06:48] he has to be a student of the word and
[1:06:50] he is
[1:06:51] and i want to thank him for that
[1:06:54] but not only that the lord showed me
[1:06:57] something in a visitation here just a
[1:06:59] bit ago
[1:07:00] of of our great gathering
[1:07:03] and he showed me that before ministry
[1:07:06] would go there would be worship leaders
[1:07:09] that he had raised up
[1:07:12] raised up to worship
[1:07:14] and
[1:07:15] and showed me men and i'm just going to
[1:07:17] name them and there's a there's
[1:07:18] thousands of them but men like andrew
[1:07:22] uh
[1:07:23] timothy pruitt
[1:07:25] michael ray
[1:07:26] uh
[1:07:27] we were just with ben ben erickson men
[1:07:30] like that that have a special anointing
[1:07:33] on them to meet
[1:07:35] not just to sing songs
[1:07:38] but to lead in worship
[1:07:41] whether you know it or not worship is
[1:07:43] the key to opening the heart
[1:07:45] and it's that's where god
[1:07:48] dwells in the praises of his people
[1:07:52] he builds trees to to worship he he has
[1:07:55] animals to worship
[1:07:57] birds worship and sing
[1:08:00] it's it's a noisy kingdom with god
[1:08:04] now you're the highest specie you're his
[1:08:07] wife
[1:08:11] he's not looking for a mannequin
[1:08:16] he don't want your your just your your
[1:08:19] selfishness and
[1:08:20] your you're closing yourself up and well
[1:08:23] i'm going to let somebody else no he's
[1:08:25] wanting you
[1:08:27] he's wanting you to get beyond yourself
[1:08:32] now listen this is easy once you get the
[1:08:34] holy ghost
[1:08:36] your resistance to worship tells you you
[1:08:38] don't have it
[1:08:50] well i'm afraid i'll get i'll get beside
[1:08:52] of myself you didn't mind getting beside
[1:08:54] of yourself when you were drunk on
[1:08:55] alcohol
[1:09:00] and you were a slobbery nasty idiot
[1:09:06] come on
[1:09:20] then you you did things that were very
[1:09:23] uncharacteristic
[1:09:29] that we don't want to mention today
[1:09:31] because you were beyond yourself
[1:09:35] found yourself in the arms of another
[1:09:37] lover in times
[1:09:39] [Music]
[1:09:44] because you were under the influence
[1:09:48] of another spirit
[1:09:51] now here we're under the influence of
[1:09:52] god
[1:09:55] and god don't do anything out of order
[1:09:57] you won't have to worry about
[1:09:59] women flipping upside down and
[1:10:05] god don't do silly stuff
[1:10:08] neither is he a showboat he's a
[1:10:10] gentleman
[1:10:14] brother branham operated and taught us
[1:10:16] his ministries that
[1:10:17] that he was a gentleman he taught us
[1:10:20] pulpit manners he taught us how how to
[1:10:22] to speak he taught us different things
[1:10:25] and
[1:10:26] and
[1:10:27] he had to institute a lot of different
[1:10:29] things because there was a lot of
[1:10:31] wow wild stuff that was going on
[1:10:34] and you say well brother ron it's going
[1:10:36] to get out of hand don't you worry
[1:10:38] there's always enough wet blankets
[1:10:40] around
[1:10:44] put it out so
[1:10:46] i i i'm thrilled as i was standing over
[1:10:49] there i had these comments to make and i
[1:10:51] thought
[1:10:52] well
[1:10:54] god's allowing andrew to do what i'm
[1:10:56] getting ready to talk to him about
[1:10:58] so i say job well done
[1:11:00] amen god bless you andrew
[1:11:08] amen god bless you
[1:11:11] amen
[1:11:13] people get jealous of andrew
[1:11:16] well you're just getting jealous and
[1:11:18] you're just showing that to god and
[1:11:20] people have left this church because
[1:11:22] they were jealous of him i said
[1:11:24] good
[1:11:29] and i really mean that
[1:11:50] maybe i said something in the flesh
[1:11:51] right there but i meant it anyway so
[1:11:54] amen
[1:11:57] i so love you with all of my heart
[1:12:00] so love you
[1:12:02] that song that was saying means a whole
[1:12:05] lot to our
[1:12:06] family even when you don't see him
[1:12:09] you're working
[1:12:11] because
[1:12:12] angels sang it
[1:12:14] and brother tim heard it
[1:12:18] on the other side of the house
[1:12:21] and connie sang it at two o'clock
[1:12:30] and brother brother tim had a dream
[1:12:33] about seeing buzzards and pigs eating
[1:12:36] those buzzards
[1:12:39] amen i would like to personally thank
[1:12:41] god for two and a half years
[1:12:45] of of being able to live through this
[1:12:47] cancer and taken the treatment i'd like
[1:12:50] to thank god for that
[1:13:01] it is not for sissies i apologize that
[1:13:05] some of you had to see that this week
[1:13:07] and the difficulties and the things that
[1:13:09] go on generally i can hide a lot of
[1:13:11] things
[1:13:12] but when you're sick you're sick and
[1:13:13] when you're weak you're weak and so
[1:13:15] but thank you for your patience with me
[1:13:17] through this through this trial
[1:13:20] and uh
[1:13:21] but we're we're getting through it
[1:13:23] and so we we thank you for that
[1:13:25] sometimes the cure is worse than the the
[1:13:27] disease itself and so
[1:13:30] amen i want you to remember there's
[1:13:32] churches that are affected by covet
[1:13:33] again just be careful and if you're sick
[1:13:36] please stay home
[1:13:38] and do that for us and uh we we're
[1:13:41] certainly
[1:13:42] we're certainly thankful that god has

[1:14:58] but i'm thrilled
[1:14:59] i'm thrilled you're going to find
[1:15:01] yourself here today in this sermon
[1:15:04] sister neda so i want you to pay very
[1:15:06] close attention to it david you're going
[1:15:08] to find yourself in this as well
[1:15:11] amen along with 200 and whatever people
[1:15:14] here
[1:15:15] you're going to find yourself in these
[1:15:17] scriptures
[1:15:18] i want you to remember the topic in a
[1:15:21] mess
[1:15:23] and abraham journeyed from fence towards
[1:15:26] south country
[1:15:28] and dwelled between kadesh
[1:15:31] and sher
[1:15:33] and sojourned in greer
[1:15:36] and abraham said to sarah his wife
[1:15:43] she is my sister
[1:15:45] and amelie
[1:15:47] king of greer
[1:15:49] sent
[1:15:50] and took sarah
[1:15:54] but god came to amaleech in a dream by
[1:15:56] night
[1:15:57] and said to him behold thou art but a
[1:16:01] dead man
[1:16:03] for the woman which thou has taken
[1:16:07] she is a man's
[1:16:09] wife
[1:16:11] you may be seated
[1:16:18] brother branham says this he says and
[1:16:20] god give him the land of of palestine
[1:16:25] and he told him not to leave
[1:16:28] not to leave there
[1:16:30] and any jew that leaves palestine
[1:16:33] was backslid
[1:16:35] god caught told him to stay there
[1:16:38] and if god tells you to do something
[1:16:40] another
[1:16:42] and you don't do it
[1:16:46] i bet you can predict the next words
[1:16:48] then you're a backslid
[1:16:52] if god tells you to do something
[1:16:56] and you don't do it then
[1:16:58] you're backslid
[1:17:01] is that right
[1:17:02] [Music]
[1:17:03] all right a drought came on
[1:17:06] to try
[1:17:08] abraham's faith
[1:17:11] and instead of abraham staying there
[1:17:15] no
[1:17:16] he couldn't stay there he run off and
[1:17:18] took sarah and went about 300 miles
[1:17:22] wish i had time to get on that
[1:17:24] down to another land
[1:17:27] and when he got there
[1:17:30] then he got this king down there emma
[1:17:34] leach
[1:17:35] he was a young fella hey how you doing
[1:17:39] he was a young fella
[1:17:42] and this young fella he was looking for
[1:17:44] a sweetheart
[1:17:47] so he found
[1:17:49] so he found abraham's wife
[1:17:52] sarah
[1:17:54] and fell in love with her
[1:17:56] and abraham said
[1:17:58] now you tell him
[1:18:00] that you are not you are my sister
[1:18:03] and i'm your brother
[1:18:06] so that pleased amaleech
[1:18:09] so he said all right we'll just take her
[1:18:13] over to the castle
[1:18:15] and i guess the women fixed her up and
[1:18:17] he was going to marry her the next day
[1:18:21] notice these key phrases next day
[1:18:24] and admiral h was a good man
[1:18:26] a righteous man and that night
[1:18:29] that night while he was sleeping the
[1:18:32] lord appeared to him and said
[1:18:34] you're as good as a dead man
[1:18:38] the man the woman that you have got out
[1:18:42] there to marry
[1:18:44] is another man's wife
[1:18:49] watch
[1:18:50] another man's wife
[1:18:52] why he said lord you know the integrity
[1:18:55] of my heart
[1:18:58] a righteous
[1:18:59] holy man you know the integrity of my
[1:19:02] heart
[1:19:04] that man told me
[1:19:07] that that was his sister
[1:19:10] and and didn't she tell herself that
[1:19:13] that's my brother
[1:19:16] and he said god said
[1:19:19] i know the integrity of your heart
[1:19:22] and that's the reason i've kept you from
[1:19:24] sin and against me
[1:19:28] but he's my prophet
[1:19:34] what was it
[1:19:35] he backslid a
[1:19:37] and a little lion shyster
[1:19:42] is that right oh no
[1:19:44] there ain't no little white lies they're
[1:19:46] either black lives
[1:19:51] or they're not lies at all
[1:19:54] the man is sitting there telling a point
[1:19:58] blank la
[1:20:00] telling that that was his
[1:20:02] sister
[1:20:04] when it was his wife
[1:20:07] beating around the bush backslidden
[1:20:10] and here was a righteous man standing
[1:20:13] before god and said
[1:20:15] lord
[1:20:16] you know my heart
[1:20:19] but i'll not hear your prayer
[1:20:21] ammo each
[1:20:24] take him
[1:20:25] take her back
[1:20:28] let him pray for you
[1:20:30] he's my prophet
[1:20:34] i'll hear him
[1:20:36] yeah backslider
[1:20:38] but that's my prophet
[1:20:40] that's the truth
[1:20:45] i want you to just absorb some things
[1:20:47] and now i want to kind of give you a
[1:20:48] thing
[1:20:51] brother joe read from
[1:20:53] romans 8 most of you know that's been
[1:20:56] here forever know that that's one of my
[1:20:58] favorite scriptures romans 8 and 28. i
[1:21:01] want to read it out of the passion
[1:21:03] statements this morning passion books
[1:21:05] you probably won't have that maybe you
[1:21:07] do maybe you don't in a similar way the
[1:21:09] holy spirit takes us
[1:21:13] that's verse 26
[1:21:15] in our human frailty
[1:21:17] notice these words
[1:21:20] to empower us
[1:21:22] in our weakness
[1:21:28] in a similar way the holy spirit takes
[1:21:31] us
[1:21:32] to hold us in our human frailty
[1:21:36] to empower us in our weakness
[1:21:39] for example at times we don't even know
[1:21:42] how to pray
[1:21:45] or know the best things to ask for
[1:21:48] but the holy spirit rises up within us
[1:21:52] to us to super intercede on our behalf
[1:21:58] pleading to god with emotional size too
[1:22:02] deep for words
[1:22:04] listen i've been at that spot to where i
[1:22:06] didn't have power to pray but i just
[1:22:10] moaned in the presence of god and i
[1:22:13] could feel him
[1:22:15] on that hospital bed i could feel his
[1:22:18] presence echoing down over top of me
[1:22:24] verse 27 god the searcher of the heart
[1:22:28] knows fully our longings
[1:22:31] yet he also understands the desires of
[1:22:34] the spirit because the holy spirit
[1:22:37] passionately
[1:22:38] pleads before god for us
[1:22:41] his holy ones in perfect harmony with
[1:22:44] god's plan
[1:22:46] and our destiny
[1:22:49] verse 28
[1:22:51] so we are convinced
[1:22:54] that every detail of our life
[1:22:57] i love this brother roger
[1:22:59] every detail of our lives is continually
[1:23:03] woven together to fit into god's perfect
[1:23:07] plan
[1:23:09] and bringing good into our lives for we
[1:23:13] are his love us
[1:23:15] who has been called to fulfill his
[1:23:18] design purpose
[1:23:20] for he knew all about us before we were
[1:23:23] born and he destined us from the
[1:23:26] beginning to share the likeness of his
[1:23:28] son this means the son is the oldest
[1:23:32] among the vast family of the brothers
[1:23:34] and sisters who will become
[1:23:36] just like him
[1:23:41] total adoption
[1:23:44] having determined our destiny ahead of
[1:23:46] time
[1:23:47] he called this to himself
[1:23:51] transformed his perfect righteousness
[1:23:56] to everyone he called
[1:23:58] and those who possess that perfect
[1:24:01] righteousness
[1:24:02] he co-glorified
[1:24:06] with his own son
[1:24:10] hallelujah
[1:24:13] hallelujah
[1:24:18] abraham had had some real experiences
[1:24:20] with god
[1:24:25] some fantastic experiences
[1:24:29] god speaks to him in genesis chapter 17.
[1:24:34] and he says abram
[1:24:36] when abram was 90 years old and nine the
[1:24:38] lord appeared to him
[1:24:40] to abram and said unto him
[1:24:43] i am the almighty god to walk before me
[1:24:46] and be thou perfect that's going to be
[1:24:48] that's going to be incredibly
[1:24:50] needful to hang on to
[1:24:52] walk before me and be thou perfect
[1:24:55] and i will make my covenant between me
[1:24:58] and thee
[1:24:59] god's a personal god
[1:25:02] and multiply thy seed
[1:25:04] exceedingly
[1:25:06] and abraham fell on his face and talked
[1:25:07] with him saying ask for me behold my
[1:25:10] covenant is with thee
[1:25:12] and doubt shall
[1:25:14] and he talked with and abraham fell on
[1:25:16] his face and god talked with him saying
[1:25:19] ask for me
[1:25:20] behold my covenant is with thee and thou
[1:25:22] shalt be a father of many nations
[1:25:26] neither shall thy name
[1:25:28] any more be called abram
[1:25:32] but thy name shall be called abraham
[1:25:36] for a father of many nations
[1:25:39] have i made thee
[1:25:41] and i will make thee exceededly fruitful
[1:25:44] and i will make nations of thee and
[1:25:48] kings shall come out of thee i want you
[1:25:50] to understand this is more than just to
[1:25:52] abraham
[1:25:53] god is having a conference with his seed
[1:25:56] with you
[1:26:00] you're thinking this is four or five
[1:26:01] thousand years ago this conference has
[1:26:04] you in his mind
[1:26:06] god is saying this to abraham
[1:26:09] because if you remember god speaks to
[1:26:12] him in a conversation and he said can
[1:26:14] you count the dust that's the granulars
[1:26:17] of the sand
[1:26:19] no man can do that that's your natural
[1:26:22] seed and he said look to the stars
[1:26:26] and we preached it look to the stars
[1:26:30] that's a type of your spiritual seed
[1:26:33] no man can count the stars and everyone
[1:26:37] is hanging in his place has a proper
[1:26:40] position has a proper name has a proper
[1:26:43] calling
[1:26:44] [Applause]
[1:26:46] you couldn't put yourself there god put
[1:26:50] you there
[1:26:55] i want you to just notice this isn't
[1:26:57] part
[1:26:58] abraham and part god
[1:27:01] god is making a covenant with him
[1:27:06] he's swearing by himself
[1:27:08] when he can swear by no greater you
[1:27:11] always swear to the grader
[1:27:14] are you with me they put their hands on
[1:27:16] the bible and swear to the to the
[1:27:19] perfect book
[1:27:21] i'll tell no lie
[1:27:23] then if they lie it goes before god not
[1:27:26] before a judge it goes before god
[1:27:38] there's a conference with him and tells
[1:27:39] him that
[1:27:42] he says that uh
[1:27:46] am the almighty
[1:27:48] he tells him over and over again in
[1:27:50] meetings
[1:27:55] everything is working towards
[1:27:59] god be coming flesh to abraham
[1:28:03] that's what
[1:28:04] this message has done
[1:28:06] we've had visitations
[1:28:10] but god wants to do more than have
[1:28:11] visitations with you
[1:28:17] he's got something for you and i wanted
[1:28:19] to speak to you
[1:28:21] god comes and he
[1:28:23] we hear brother branham talking in a
[1:28:24] sermon called is there anything too hard
[1:28:26] for the lord
[1:28:29] and they're there abraham has now
[1:28:31] confessed for
[1:28:32] for quite a while
[1:28:34] more than two decades
[1:28:36] i'm going to have a son
[1:28:38] now he's produced a son
[1:28:41] through his own energies
[1:28:43] through the bonds woman
[1:28:46] but
[1:28:47] brother branham goes back and and you'll
[1:28:50] hear brother branham sometimes brother
[1:28:51] brandon preaches a sermon and whether
[1:28:53] you know it or not he's actually
[1:28:55] preaching a vision
[1:28:57] and he's not just telling a story
[1:28:59] you hear him in the in the prayer lines
[1:29:01] he'll tell them about a yellow dog or a
[1:29:03] bus or tell him about a black car and he
[1:29:06] tell him about a doctor he's a short
[1:29:08] doctor he's kind of fat he's got real
[1:29:10] big black rim he's looking at that
[1:29:13] and so no doubt as a prophet being a
[1:29:16] seer he's looking at the vision of the
[1:29:19] word
[1:29:20] and he's watching the event as it goes
[1:29:22] on i don't think i'm adventuring without
[1:29:24] authority right here
[1:29:26] and so
[1:29:27] here is here is sarah and she's in the
[1:29:30] tent now she's begun to get older she's
[1:29:32] been harassed for years she's been
[1:29:35] barren she's been frustrated she's been
[1:29:37] intimidated god's made a promise to
[1:29:40] abraham she can't make it happen
[1:29:45] she's more than willing to make it
[1:29:47] happen but she can't make it happen and
[1:29:50] she's fussy she's stewie she's groppy
[1:30:00] brother branham says that
[1:30:01] she's hollering out the door and
[1:30:03] abraham's sitting outside
[1:30:05] he's got an atmosphere going on outside
[1:30:08] you know you want to get away from that
[1:30:09] if that's going on you want to
[1:30:12] you want to breathe
[1:30:15] you want to breathe some of you young
[1:30:16] guys it's going to happen to you too
[1:30:19] you want to get a place to where you
[1:30:20] breathe
[1:30:26] kind of detox a little bit detox
[1:30:29] you know
[1:30:30] barometric chamber you know
[1:30:39] men this is not a good time to say amen
[1:30:41] it's not a good time to laugh
[1:30:44] it's not a good time it's just not
[1:30:46] but you know what i'm talking about you
[1:30:48] can see me after church
[1:30:57] you know what i saw caravan go by the
[1:30:59] other day abraham
[1:31:02] and in that caravan they were selling
[1:31:04] hats
[1:31:05] and they were selling dresses and i saw
[1:31:08] miss locke the other day she had onto
[1:31:10] some fancy stuff
[1:31:12] them care fans don't come up here
[1:31:17] these little rags i'm wearing he's just
[1:31:19] listening
[1:31:20] uh-huh
[1:31:23] now brother branham said that satan was
[1:31:26] trying to block the visitation of god
[1:31:32] so if you feel that stewie spirit
[1:31:35] understand you're real christians
[1:31:38] and if you can remember at his trick
[1:31:42] can i just share some information
[1:31:44] when you feel that just that naughty
[1:31:47] spirit coming on you or that biting
[1:31:51] you feel that
[1:31:52] do the opposite
[1:31:59] ask god to help you in a moment he's
[1:32:02] there
[1:32:04] don't grieve him away do the opposite
[1:32:08] where there's hate or bite
[1:32:10] flip it and show love like never before
[1:32:15] brother and i need an example there's a
[1:32:17] man coming down the aisle he's crushed
[1:32:19] to preachers he's crushed a lot of men
[1:32:22] tonight he's going to crush brother
[1:32:23] branham he's going to and he begins to
[1:32:26] make his boast
[1:32:28] and as he's making his boats brother
[1:32:31] brown said this night
[1:32:33] you'll pin my feet to the floor because
[1:32:35] brother branstad i felt sorry for him
[1:32:40] and i found love for him
[1:32:44] a man was going to crush him
[1:32:46] and then he fell
[1:32:48] right to the floor
[1:32:53] these three travelers came
[1:32:56] and they came to abraham's tent
[1:32:59] i find it an incredible thing
[1:33:02] that we have a place of worship here
[1:33:06] that can host
[1:33:07] the presence of god
[1:33:12] i never want this place
[1:33:14] to ever take it for granted
[1:33:17] that he's just going to be here
[1:33:21] he must be invited and when he is
[1:33:24] invited it is when he comes wash his
[1:33:27] feet
[1:33:29] make him comfortable
[1:33:31] he's here to do business
[1:33:33] he can heal you he can save you he can
[1:33:37] feel your life he can turn you around in
[1:33:40] what you've been working on for months
[1:33:42] and years he can do it in seconds
[1:33:46] [Applause]
[1:33:48] [Music]
[1:33:48] [Applause]
[1:33:56] when god came and he sat down in front
[1:33:57] of abraham and
[1:33:59] remember abraham recognized that he was
[1:34:01] the lord
[1:34:02] to which he had been speaking to that's
[1:34:05] the reason a lot of people don't
[1:34:06] recognize the lord they ain't been
[1:34:07] talking to him
[1:34:10] and so
[1:34:11] when he came in
[1:34:14] he begins to talk and
[1:34:16] abraham has meat and milk
[1:34:21] now god has stepped into a body
[1:34:24] because he has a meeting with abraham
[1:34:26] god's got a plan
[1:34:28] and in his plan he's got a book
[1:34:32] he's got a lamb's book of life
[1:34:34] now abraham can't produce these names in
[1:34:37] this book
[1:34:40] he's done proved he's got too old
[1:34:43] his wife is too old it is impossible for
[1:34:47] him to humanly do it
[1:34:53] are you with me now
[1:34:55] let me just say this to you and i
[1:34:57] you and i cannot produce rapture with
[1:35:00] our fleshly ability
[1:35:04] it's going to take the word in action
[1:35:07] personal revelation in your life that
[1:35:10] you see yourself in the word
[1:35:14] now god has a conversation with abraham
[1:35:16] and in that conversation he reminds him
[1:35:18] about his promises
[1:35:20] he said thy seat shall possess the gates
[1:35:22] of their enemy that is a promise to
[1:35:25] which shamgar will grab a hold of
[1:35:27] naboth will hang on to david will kill
[1:35:30] his tens and tens of thousands solomon
[1:35:33] will raise up the greatest temple you
[1:35:36] will overcome demons and principalities
[1:35:39] because of the conversation that god had
[1:35:42] with abraham
[1:35:43] [Music]
[1:35:44] because you're a part of that seed
[1:35:47] lineage and you can take the word of god
[1:35:50] through your supernatural lips and begin
[1:35:52] to speak it
[1:35:55] are you with me many people sabotage
[1:35:58] their testimony with negativity
[1:36:03] and you can't have a positive life and a
[1:36:05] negative life at the same time
[1:36:09] it's kind of like being on a diet and
[1:36:12] eating a donut
[1:36:14] come on preach now
[1:36:15] [Applause]
[1:36:18] the power of life and death is in your
[1:36:20] tongue
[1:36:22] sarah had to get it for herself
[1:36:26] not just abraham's promise but it's
[1:36:29] sarah's promise
[1:36:30] [Music]
[1:36:37] god can say a lot of things about you
[1:36:39] but you got to believe it
[1:36:44] you got to believe it
[1:36:50] you ask her
[1:36:52] where's sarah
[1:36:55] why did she laugh
[1:36:58] i didn't laugh
[1:37:00] abraham tells her she's an intense door
[1:37:02] behind you
[1:37:04] to prove that to be a fact
[1:37:07] brother branham would stand on the stage
[1:37:10] to show that same melchizedek sign
[1:37:14] forgive me if you're looking for another
[1:37:18] another messenger like what we had
[1:37:22] to show those gifts there's not another
[1:37:24] one
[1:37:27] there's not another one you can you can
[1:37:29] search you can search the internet
[1:37:32] and they're going to tell you all kind
[1:37:34] of bad things on brother branham and all
[1:37:35] kinds of nonsense
[1:37:37] but why don't you throw that internet
[1:37:39] away
[1:37:40] because that same internet is going to
[1:37:42] say these things about jesus
[1:37:46] [Applause]
[1:37:48] and if you search deep enough there's
[1:37:50] there's somebody in that's in your enemy
[1:37:53] camp that's gonna say some things about
[1:37:55] you so that discredits you
[1:38:04] i went to the internet and i found a lot
[1:38:05] of thoughts on brother branham hey he
[1:38:07] wasn't god
[1:38:09] news bulletin brother branham wasn't god
[1:38:12] he was a human being he made mistakes he
[1:38:14] was honest
[1:38:17] the guy that i'm talking about today
[1:38:19] abraham i want to talk to you a little
[1:38:21] bit he had a flaw
[1:38:28] now god could have killed sarah
[1:38:31] because she laughed at him
[1:38:34] but because she was part of the promise
[1:38:41] he asked her a question
[1:38:45] is there anything too hard
[1:38:48] for god
[1:38:50] the answer to that question if you're
[1:38:51] still looking for it is there's nothing
[1:38:54] too hard for god
[1:38:56] because it's the same god
[1:39:00] that created the sun try that out for
[1:39:03] starters
[1:39:06] you know hey
[1:39:08] all but all these other gods well all
[1:39:09] these other gods didn't create the sun
[1:39:16] the gods of the nba they didn't create
[1:39:18] the sun
[1:39:19] the gods of the nfl they didn't create
[1:39:22] the sun they may make a hundred million
[1:39:24] dollars for throwing a ball through a
[1:39:25] hoop but they didn't create the sun
[1:39:28] they'll bury them in a few days and
[1:39:30] they're going to need to know the god of
[1:39:32] the sun
[1:39:34] [Applause]
[1:39:37] and he asked her is there anything too
[1:39:40] hard for the lord
[1:39:48] now now here's where we come
[1:39:52] we're in the last day message
[1:39:55] we're a people that will take a body
[1:39:58] change
[1:39:59] universally
[1:40:01] around the world there are churches that
[1:40:03] are
[1:40:04] just like us in many ways
[1:40:06] around the world that believe this
[1:40:08] message with all of their heart
[1:40:10] they've translated it they've got it on
[1:40:12] computers some of them are behind or
[1:40:15] some of them are just getting it but let
[1:40:17] me just say don't never get yourself all
[1:40:18] caught up on people just getting it
[1:40:20] because jesus gives you a parable about
[1:40:23] 11th our workers
[1:40:27] they're going to get the same reward
[1:40:29] that the ones because god's going to get
[1:40:31] received
[1:40:33] let me just say he's all in the business
[1:40:35] about getting his seat he knows how to
[1:40:38] find them where to find them he knows
[1:40:40] exactly where to get to them
[1:40:49] now abraham's had some incredible
[1:40:50] visitations
[1:40:52] now he's just walking in it
[1:40:55] he's just basking in it he's testifying
[1:40:57] in it the message is now abraham and
[1:41:00] sarah we're going to have children and
[1:41:02] these children are going to be the
[1:41:03] heritage of god and he could i'd say oh
[1:41:06] abraham could do some preaching right
[1:41:08] there my children are going to come
[1:41:10] through me as old as i am i don't know
[1:41:12] how god's going to do it but god's going
[1:41:14] to have a lineage
[1:41:17] god's going the messiah is going to come
[1:41:19] through here i want you to understand
[1:41:21] i've come to a revelation that the
[1:41:23] messiah is going to come through
[1:41:25] this sea
[1:41:27] adam fell in the garden he listened to
[1:41:30] the wrong voice and he redeemed eve
[1:41:34] with his eyes wide open knowing he god
[1:41:38] would kill her
[1:41:40] so he loved her so much he gave himself
[1:41:43] for her as a type of jesus christ
[1:41:51] now
[1:41:55] i find it interesting that what i'm
[1:41:57] getting ready to speak to you over the
[1:41:59] next 10 to 15 minutes
[1:42:01] it's not in any
[1:42:04] it's not any any schools of thoughts
[1:42:08] of any religion
[1:42:11] they don't bring it up
[1:42:14] i've talked to doctors of divinity all
[1:42:16] over the place
[1:42:18] i've set with great men
[1:42:21] that
[1:42:21] that had great educations
[1:42:24] had no clue
[1:42:26] about how abraham and sarah
[1:42:29] has a baby
[1:42:30] at this age
[1:42:32] but brother branham said being the
[1:42:34] messenger of the day that is going to
[1:42:36] reveal those hidden mystery thunders and
[1:42:40] seals
[1:42:42] the voice of god that spoke to abraham
[1:42:45] the same voice of god
[1:42:49] is going to speak to the bride
[1:42:51] and he's going to drop those mysteries
[1:42:54] to the bride
[1:42:55] others will just
[1:43:00] i don't believe that
[1:43:02] well it's kind of like acts 2 38
[1:43:07] you can see it in the scriptures that's
[1:43:09] the only way anybody was baptized
[1:43:12] in the book of acts
[1:43:15] was in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:43:18] the name of the lord jesus that's the
[1:43:20] way they were born that's the way they
[1:43:22] were put into the water and it is the it
[1:43:25] is literally revokes the jurisdiction of
[1:43:28] satan of your sins off of you
[1:43:32] are you with me the blood washes you the
[1:43:34] water washes you the word's going to
[1:43:37] wash you and it's going to fill you with
[1:43:39] life that you'll live the life of jesus
[1:43:43] christ
[1:43:46] but matthew writes it and he literally
[1:43:50] has it as a mystery baptize them in the
[1:43:53] name of the father and of the son out of
[1:43:56] the holy ghost none of those are names
[1:43:58] they're titles
[1:44:02] there are titles and the reason it has
[1:44:04] to be a mystery
[1:44:06] because the mystery is jesus christ
[1:44:10] being god
[1:44:13] and the trinitarians refused to receive
[1:44:16] that jesus was god
[1:44:18] in human flesh
[1:44:22] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:44:25] bodily
[1:44:26] [Music]
[1:44:28] he was both man and god
[1:44:34] we ought to shout right there
[1:44:36] [Applause]
[1:44:46] jesus would say i am the resurrection
[1:44:48] and the love
[1:44:49] lay this body down and i'll take it up
[1:44:51] again in three days
[1:44:53] i my father are one for that reason
[1:44:56] those jews that were oneness god or they
[1:45:00] were one god belief they knew that if
[1:45:03] jesus was god their religion was wrong
[1:45:08] and they had missed the messiah
[1:45:11] they didn't go to stone him because of
[1:45:13] the
[1:45:14] miracles they didn't go to stone him
[1:45:17] because of he was a great preacher he
[1:45:20] identified himself as god
[1:45:27] he turns around to his disciples says
[1:45:29] whom do men say that are the son of man
[1:45:31] out
[1:45:32] some said thou art jeremiah or one of
[1:45:34] the prophets
[1:45:36] but he said who do you say that i am
[1:45:39] now this is the important key 2000 years
[1:45:42] later
[1:45:42] if you can't see who jesus is you'll
[1:45:45] never see who you are
[1:45:52] because he's king and your queen
[1:45:59] and he came to redeem you
[1:46:02] are you with me he didn't send a man he
[1:46:04] came himself
[1:46:06] he sent a lot of prophets as he was
[1:46:08] descending down through the gentile
[1:46:10] through the through the jewish
[1:46:12] seven church ages he sent prophets and
[1:46:15] they were images of god and there was
[1:46:17] parts of god but he had to come himself
[1:46:23] he came as a theophany body in the tent
[1:46:25] of abraham but he had to come himself to
[1:46:28] redeem you
[1:46:30] why did he have to redeem you
[1:46:33] now we come to this point
[1:46:36] abraham is walking
[1:46:38] and as he's walking
[1:46:41] something happens brother vernon
[1:46:45] they wake up one morning
[1:46:48] and a 100 year old man
[1:46:51] looks like a 20 year old man
[1:47:03] and when tara and and when sarah breaks
[1:47:06] through the veil
[1:47:08] oh
[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:17] [Applause]
[1:47:26] you know what i'm talking about right
[1:47:27] here i don't have to explain i don't
[1:47:29] have to go on no longer here
[1:47:36] brother branham
[1:47:37] the seer of this age would call her the
[1:47:40] most beautiful woman
[1:47:44] let me just say when god does a job
[1:47:47] he does it well
[1:47:55] now they got in problems
[1:47:59] god tested their faith
[1:48:02] and now they're going to move
[1:48:04] and in their move
[1:48:08] in their move
[1:48:11] there's a testimony comes forth
[1:48:15] that they have turned young
[1:48:20] help me right here lord
[1:48:23] so somewhere another when they get 300
[1:48:25] miles away to where the rain is still
[1:48:27] falling
[1:48:31] you know
[1:48:33] and and they get there
[1:48:35] brother branham calls him backslidden
[1:48:38] he calls him a lion shyster
[1:48:42] that's what he calls him i mean brother
[1:48:43] i'm just plain honest our faith of our
[1:48:46] fathers
[1:48:47] the the man himself
[1:48:50] is now in a mess
[1:48:54] he enters the city
[1:49:00] how many of you men this father's day
[1:49:03] let me get a little sideways here just
[1:49:04] for a second
[1:49:06] how many you men walk into the room and
[1:49:08] the most beautiful woman in the room is
[1:49:10] on your arm
[1:49:18] [Applause]
[1:49:24] that's what i'm talking about
[1:49:26] you know that makes this five foot five
[1:49:31] red-headed guy
[1:49:34] you know she puts her arm up under me
[1:49:36] and kind of scrooges up the side of me
[1:49:37] you know
[1:49:40] make me feel 20 again
[1:49:46] and he walks into the city
[1:49:49] remember his father's dead
[1:49:54] and he walks into this city
[1:49:59] and the king notices who's on his arm
[1:50:03] and he says
[1:50:06] tell him
[1:50:07] you're my
[1:50:08] sister because being the most beautiful
[1:50:11] woman
[1:50:13] i just kill you
[1:50:14] i keep
[1:50:22] so emma leach being a king
[1:50:26] being a righteous man
[1:50:28] he just chooses her
[1:50:31] now this is interesting
[1:50:33] he takes her to his castle to be taken
[1:50:37] care of by his attendance
[1:50:39] tomorrow i'll marry you
[1:50:42] you'll be queen tomorrow
[1:50:44] think about that sarah you'll be queen
[1:50:48] now i want i want to just bring up a lot
[1:50:51] of things right quick
[1:50:54] what a mess they're in
[1:51:01] what a mess
[1:51:04] they
[1:51:05] not god
[1:51:07] they
[1:51:08] are in
[1:51:10] god didn't get them into this
[1:51:15] god didn't get them here
[1:51:18] they got their self here now let's just
[1:51:20] think about it just for a moment
[1:51:22] within 24 hours she's going to be the
[1:51:25] queen
[1:51:26] she has been for for
[1:51:29] for 90 years a barren woman
[1:51:33] how does she tell her story
[1:51:36] i've been 90 years of barren woman
[1:51:40] 90 years i felt cursed because i
[1:51:42] couldn't have a child
[1:51:44] but there was a man came from another
[1:51:46] realm and he he asked me a question is
[1:51:50] there anything too hard for the lord he
[1:51:52] looked into my eyes
[1:51:55] and i'll tell you just a few days ago i
[1:51:57] got a body change
[1:52:01] and now
[1:52:02] i'm i've lied i mean i've told him i'm a
[1:52:05] sister
[1:52:08] and now this king wants me to be his
[1:52:10] queen but there's a promise
[1:52:13] [Applause]
[1:52:16] there's a promise it's got to come forth
[1:52:19] there's an isaac that's going to be born
[1:52:22] there's iran that's got to be born
[1:52:24] there's a lot of people that's got to be
[1:52:26] born
[1:52:42] can you imagine what abraham was
[1:52:44] thinking now
[1:52:47] i've served god these years
[1:52:50] i've offered lambs i've offered sheep
[1:52:53] i've offered all for the sacrifice i've
[1:52:55] talked to god
[1:52:56] i have talked to god
[1:52:58] face to face
[1:53:00] he's came to my tent
[1:53:02] i don't have no question to know
[1:53:04] that the god that has made this promise
[1:53:10] i've led my wife down here
[1:53:14] i've led my wife i've led my family into
[1:53:16] this situation i've led the lamb's book
[1:53:22] i've read the lamb's book
[1:53:25] into a spot
[1:53:27] to where i can't do anything about it
[1:53:31] i physically can't do anything about it
[1:53:34] this mess
[1:53:36] is way beyond me
[1:53:39] i'm talking to you
[1:53:44] you've been in that spot in your life
[1:53:48] where you're beyond bankrupt
[1:53:51] word your relationships are beyond
[1:53:54] fixable
[1:53:56] where your jobs is beyond destroyed
[1:54:00] it's not over till god says
[1:54:03] it's over
[1:54:05] [Applause]
[1:54:21] i cannot imagine abraham's thoughts
[1:54:24] of how bad a mess he was in
[1:54:27] the god that had now restored his body
[1:54:37] and now here i lay
[1:54:39] looking at the stars he told me to look
[1:54:41] at
[1:54:43] i can reach out into my tent
[1:54:46] and i can feel the sand
[1:54:48] that he told me to count
[1:54:56] i'm in a mess
[1:55:00] i'm in a mess
[1:55:04] i'm in a real mess here
[1:55:07] now god goes to work
[1:55:10] because they've just did
[1:55:14] what is going to go under the seals
[1:55:19] because now god has proved to humanity
[1:55:21] you can't do this on your own
[1:55:26] even when i'm walking with you you can't
[1:55:28] do this on your own
[1:55:30] so don't get yourself so self-righteous
[1:55:32] to think that i'm doing this let me just
[1:55:34] say you can't breathe your own now
[1:55:38] you can say now i lay me down to sleep
[1:55:40] and you don't have a promise of waking
[1:55:41] up tomorrow morning
[1:55:44] i'm not the only one under a death trap
[1:55:46] here we're all in the same situation
[1:55:50] we're one heartbeat away from god
[1:55:57] i don't care how much money you got what
[1:55:58] kind of house you got what kind of car
[1:56:00] you drove
[1:56:02] i don't care what you do
[1:56:08] oh brother ron i got a job that's way up
[1:56:10] yonder to someone another
[1:56:12] what do you do
[1:56:17] one heart beat and you're naked on a
[1:56:20] slab
[1:56:23] next that you come in here and naked
[1:56:25] you're gonna leave and the only thing
[1:56:27] that's going to be good about you is
[1:56:29] your character and whether you've got
[1:56:32] jesus or not
[1:56:51] bridge brothers
[1:57:02] god goes to ambulance because amulets is
[1:57:04] a righteous man
[1:57:06] he can speak to him
[1:57:07] now god has to have them to wayward has
[1:57:10] to you know even in your backslidden
[1:57:11] state god has to watch over you
[1:57:14] and so he has to have you to
[1:57:16] go a certain way
[1:57:18] so that you'll fulfill the will of god
[1:57:20] jonah did it and don't have time but
[1:57:22] maybe
[1:57:23] jonah did it
[1:57:25] brother branham did it
[1:57:27] you're going to do it
[1:57:30] and so god just leads him down to a
[1:57:32] righteous king the man that he could
[1:57:34] speak to
[1:57:37] and god talks to him
[1:57:39] he said the man that you're going to
[1:57:41] have as a wife
[1:57:42] he's another man's wife
[1:57:47] he's another man's wife
[1:57:50] and he said you're as good as a dead man
[1:57:54] and not only this
[1:57:56] i'll close up every womb
[1:58:02] he just opened sarah's womb and now due
[1:58:05] to this situation this mess
[1:58:08] if you marry her
[1:58:11] if you go beyond my word tonight
[1:58:21] if you marry her i'll close up every
[1:58:23] womb
[1:58:24] your nation will die
[1:58:31] how important a statement is that
[1:58:33] brother ron we'll just have other let me
[1:58:35] just say sodom and gor gemara will never
[1:58:37] produce one child
[1:58:41] it is a death trap of satan
[1:58:48] don't care what kind of emojis that you
[1:58:49] put out
[1:58:51] it's a death prayer it's a death trap of
[1:58:53] satan
[1:59:04] so

[2:08:09] that he just said it in kind of passing
[2:08:13] and i i didn't even catch it
[2:08:16] but i i got to thinking on that thing
[2:08:19] he said when the rapture happens around
[2:08:21] the world
[2:08:23] god has to take people
[2:08:28] that no doubt don't look ready and make
[2:08:31] them ready
[2:08:32] in seconds
[2:08:40] what a mighty god
[2:08:43] what a mighty god
[2:08:47] that we serve
[2:08:49] this is way
[2:08:52] over my pay grade
[2:08:58] way
[2:08:59] beyond your thinking
[2:09:01] well this is the way it's going to be
[2:09:03] are you really sure about that
[2:09:06] god has to take this worldwide
[2:09:09] culture
[2:09:12] education
[2:09:14] people that don't have a church they're
[2:09:16] under a tree worshiping
[2:09:20] listen
[2:09:21] no doubt many home churches
[2:09:24] many that have to stream because they
[2:09:26] live hundreds and hundreds of miles away
[2:09:29] and it's gonna cause such a reunion on
[2:09:31] this earth
[2:09:33] the sea is going to give forth their
[2:09:35] dead
[2:09:36] the biggest graveyard in the whole world
[2:09:39] is the ocean
[2:09:41] and they're going to give forth their
[2:09:42] dead
[2:09:43] and the people that have their bones
[2:09:45] have already went back to the molecules
[2:09:48] god's gonna bring it from the gases
[2:09:52] and they're gonna stand in world bodies
[2:09:55] from one dimension to another dimension
[2:09:58] step forth
[2:10:03] and we're going to gather here
[2:10:05] [Applause]
[2:10:06] in this whole chaos of mess
[2:10:09] just before our home going

[2:12:44] [Music]
[2:12:59] noah is going to get baptized this
[2:13:01] morning
[2:13:02] [Music]
[2:13:06] come but no i want you to stand beside
[2:13:08] me
[2:13:11] god made noah special
[2:13:14] called his name noah they did
[2:13:17] he's born in an incredible family
[2:13:20] he didn't do that himself as a matter of
[2:13:21] fact he had to look at nothing to do
[2:13:23] with it
[2:13:24] [Music]
[2:13:26] he didn't call he didn't get himself
[2:13:28] here
[2:13:30] we know the history as far as his
[2:13:32] grandfather being a
[2:13:34] message interpreter for decades
[2:13:37] he's standing now watching in another
[2:13:39] realm if he's allowed to look through
[2:13:40] the veil
[2:13:43] his father made a choice to believe the
[2:13:45] word with all of his heart
[2:13:47] he's raising a family
[2:13:48] [Music]
[2:13:50] we are taught here that we don't make
[2:13:51] our children
[2:13:53] we just create an atmosphere to where
[2:13:54] they'll just walk right into it
[2:13:56] noah's been wanting to get baptized for
[2:13:58] quite a while
[2:14:01] looking for the precious that that
[2:14:03] gracious moment that father was
[2:14:05] brother william was
[2:14:08] today he wants to be baptized in the
[2:14:10] name of the lord jesus christ
[2:14:13] now you see you see when abraham was
[2:14:15] laying there
[2:14:17] in that night sky looking at the stars
[2:14:20] he was looking
[2:14:21] there was another
[2:14:27] if you can't have grace for others
[2:14:30] there will not be grace for you
[2:14:32] [Music]
[2:14:37] gotta have mercy
[2:14:40] gotta have mercy
[2:14:44] you see noah had to find this spot today
[2:14:48] i know i don't know i don't think you
[2:14:50] will but
[2:14:51] you've been flirting with my
[2:14:52] granddaughter
[2:14:54] [Music]
[2:14:58] so we're going to baptize that as well
[2:15:03] [Applause]
[2:15:10] [Music]
[2:15:15] if time lasts
[2:15:17] no grow up and know this god
[2:15:20] was more than a historical god
[2:15:23] i didn't know him as his god
[2:15:26] because that's what he's been taught in
[2:15:27] his home
[2:15:29] they listen to the message every day
[2:15:30] [Music]
[2:15:32] neil married no doubt a believer
[2:15:34] that believes it and they'll produce
[2:15:37] children
[2:15:38] because they were also taught by
[2:15:40] melchizedek
[2:15:42] but one day
[2:15:46] noah will go from this dimension to
[2:15:47] another dimension
[2:15:49] as a believer
[2:15:50] [Music]
[2:15:57] the rapture happens in a few days noah
[2:15:59] will
[2:16:00] probably be taller than me
[2:16:03] a whole lot more handsome
[2:16:04] [Music]
[2:16:07] and you'll have a wife
[2:16:09] that's unbelievable
[2:16:12] but god knows how to fix everything
[2:16:14] in a moment
[2:16:18] we were born in sin
[2:16:22] in a mess
[2:16:24] we were shaping in iniquity
[2:16:28] in a mess
[2:16:30] but our god was rich
[2:16:33] in his mercy
[2:16:37] and with his great love
[2:16:39] he loves us
[2:16:41] more than we can even imagine
[2:16:44] [Music]
[2:16:54] you'll come as well
[2:16:58] [Music]
