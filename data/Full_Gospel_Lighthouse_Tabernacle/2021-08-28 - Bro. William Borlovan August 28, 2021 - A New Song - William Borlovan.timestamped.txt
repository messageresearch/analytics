[50:46] should walk around with a negative
[50:47] testimony for everything that god has
[50:50] done for us
[50:52] for everything we should be the most
[50:54] happiest people on the earth we have a

[51:16] subject

[51:20] a new song psalm chapter 40 verse 1 will
[51:23] begin
[51:24] the bible says i waited patiently for
[51:27] the lord
[51:28] and he inclined unto me and heard my cry
[51:32] he brought me up also out of a horrible
[51:34] pit out of the miry clay and set my feet
[51:37] upon a rock
[51:39] and establish my goings and he hath put
[51:42] a new song in my mouth even praise unto
[51:45] our god many shall see it and fear and
[51:48] shall trust in the lord blessed is that
[51:50] man that maketh the lord his trust and
[51:53] respecteth not the proud nor such has
[51:55] turned aside to lies many o lord my god
[51:58] are thy wonderful works which thou has
[51:59] done
[52:00] and thy thoughts which are to us word
[52:02] they cannot be reckoned up in order unto
[52:05] thee if i would declare and speak of
[52:06] them they are more than can be numbered
[52:09] ain't that the truth
[52:10] sacrifice and offering thou dost not
[52:12] desire
[52:13] mine eyes thou has opened burnt offering
[52:16] and sin offering hast thou not required
[52:18] then said i lo i come in the volume of
[52:20] the book it is written of me

[52:50] jesus christ's name amen amen god bless
[52:52] you you're seated i'd like to start
[52:55] also with a quote here the sermon hear
[52:57] ye him
[52:59] brother abraham said think of it
[53:01] when jesus comes
[53:04] and the redeemed stands there singing
[53:06] those redemption songs
[53:08] kind of like amazing grace like we just
[53:10] saw
[53:11] angels will be circled around the earth
[53:13] with bowed heads not knowing what we're
[53:15] talking about
[53:17] they never need redeeming they don't
[53:19] know what it means to be lost and be
[53:20] found but we was lost and we're found
[53:24] and we sing the redemption story
[53:28] tens of thousands times thousands with
[53:30] their hands up
[53:32] singing the redemption stories while
[53:34] we'll crown while we're crowning him
[53:36] king of kings and lord of lords when the
[53:39] angels with their heads bowed around the
[53:41] earth oh what a day what a day
[53:44] amen now brother braham teaches us that
[53:46] before
[53:48] god god is an object of worship amen so
[53:50] before god was even god
[53:52] he had to create something to begin to
[53:54] worship him and that is what made him
[53:56] god and affect god
[53:59] so the first thing that he created was
[54:01] the angels and the cherubims and they
[54:03] began to worship him as god and that
[54:06] made him god and then god the genesis
[54:08] story begins and god begins creating the
[54:10] heavens and the earth and
[54:11] everything that we see so i want us to
[54:13] point out that the angels we understand
[54:16] by the scripture that god created
[54:19] lucifer
[54:20] that lucifer was once he he was he was a
[54:23] bright and shining angel
[54:25] but he began to be lifted up with pride
[54:27] in his heart because we know that sin
[54:29] began in heaven not in the earth so
[54:32] satan went and he's a master of
[54:34] deception and we can never think within
[54:36] ourselves that we can ever outsmart the
[54:38] enemy within ourselves
[54:40] satan is a master of deception
[54:43] we find that he you find that lucifer
[54:46] actually deceived the very angels that
[54:49] seen god create
[54:50] the very angels that seen god say let
[54:53] there be light and there was light and
[54:56] let the earth bring forth seed after
[54:58] yielding after his kind the angels all
[55:00] seen god create
[55:03] yet satan was still able to deceive them
[55:07] into thinking that they that he could
[55:09] make himself greater than god
[55:11] and that is demons and evil spirits are
[55:14] fallen angels the ones that fail for
[55:17] satan's lie
[55:18] but i want us to understand something
[55:20] here
[55:21] with the prophet tells us that satan
[55:23] deceived two-thirds of the angels in
[55:25] heaven
[55:26] to believe of his life now we don't know
[55:28] what number that is but the bible tells
[55:30] us in the book of revelation
[55:32] that there's two hundred thousand
[55:34] thousand demons
[55:35] in the river euphrates that were
[55:37] unleashed to persecute the jews so we
[55:40] know by that number alone and that
[55:42] doesn't include the sicknesses and the
[55:43] evil spirits of torments
[55:45] that there's millions and millions of
[55:47] evil spirits so when these angels fell
[55:51] and listened and were deceived by
[55:53] lucifer god didn't move
[55:56] to save them
[55:58] god let them fall and he was not their
[56:02] redeemer
[56:03] millions and millions of angels fell and
[56:06] god didn't move a muscle for it
[56:09] but then when he made man brother ron
[56:11] preached on the masterpiece last weekend
[56:13] he made man and adam and eve was his
[56:15] masterpiece in the garden of eden the
[56:17] absolute expression the perfection that
[56:20] god had made
[56:21] so adam and eve fell his son fell
[56:25] and when one sun fell
[56:28] god came looking for him
[56:31] god came himself he didn't send another
[56:34] angel he didn't send gabriel
[56:37] he didn't send michael the lord himself
[56:39] came into the garden of eden screaming
[56:42] adam adam where are thou
[56:44] for one son
[56:46] but the millions of angels that fell god
[56:49] didn't move for brother stephen
[56:51] but whenever you fell and you needed a
[56:53] savior you were born a sinner god came
[56:55] looking for you
[56:57] god came the prophet of god picks it up
[56:58] and he says
[57:00] that he came screaming he said and here
[57:03] was the searchings of god
[57:05] walking running up and down through the
[57:07] garden screaming for his lost boy
[57:11] the the god god jesus christ is still
[57:14] screaming
[57:15] for his lost son and daughter of god in
[57:17] every single sermon you hear that's
[57:19] god's voice trying to speak to you
[57:21] because you can be hiding behind the
[57:23] world you hiding behind fig leaves as it
[57:26] was you can be hiding behind religion
[57:29] you could be hiding behind your parents
[57:30] you could be hiding behind church
[57:32] attendance you could be hiding around
[57:33] anything but the voice of god is
[57:35] speaking to you and has come looking for
[57:37] you
[57:38] this evening
[57:41] that is the love of god
[57:43] and if you had been brother josh jones
[57:45] if you would have been the only one that
[57:47] would have failed god would have still
[57:49] done it all
[57:51] if you are the only one
[57:53] sister cassie that needed a prophet sent
[57:55] to you to be restored and you were the
[57:57] only one that believed this message god
[57:59] would have still sent brother brown
[58:01] that's the kind of god we serve millions
[58:04] can go by not care think about god but
[58:06] god cares so much for you that he came
[58:09] himself for you
[58:10] he came himself for you in the garden of
[58:12] eden looking for you
[58:15] one son
[58:17] he was a part of adam
[58:20] one son and god came himself because the
[58:23] angels the angels that stayed in their
[58:24] first estate they don't they've never
[58:26] been sick they've never been lost
[58:29] that is why you can sing amazing grace
[58:32] that is why you can sing amazing grace
[58:34] like they can't because what satan hates
[58:37] how jealous it must make the devil
[58:40] that you have the holy ghost
[58:43] and he doesn't
[58:45] that you have the power within you to
[58:48] create a world and go live on it
[58:50] yet he's desired brother matthew to that
[58:52] that's what his desire was was to be
[58:54] like god
[58:56] so he can't create so he then is a great
[58:59] perverter
[59:00] of god's creation
[59:03] so you have the power that he's always
[59:05] lusted for
[59:06] because in you are in christ before the
[59:09] foundation of the world
[59:11] so you are before god created lucifer
[59:15] you're now god lucifer can't destroy you
[59:18] and you'll be after lucifer
[59:20] how how angry that must make the devil
[59:24] because you were before him
[59:26] you're now and you'll be long after he's
[59:29] gone
[59:30] you will you are with the father before
[59:32] the foundation of the world
[59:35] so a new song
[59:37] comes by experience
[59:39] it's a it's not just a song like like
[59:41] what it's it's a song is something you
[59:43] sing absolutely
[59:48] but a song is also
[59:51] a praise
[59:52] it's a lifestyle
[59:53] it's how you express yourself to the
[59:55] lord
[59:56] it's all a song now god is so vast and
[59:59] he's so inexhaustible there's so much to
[1:00:00] god to discover
[1:00:02] you remember brother i'm talking about
[1:00:03] the fish
[1:00:04] and you talk about the mouse and the
[1:00:06] garners of egypt and about how it god is
[1:00:08] inexhaustible and there's people and
[1:00:09] good people in the world today
[1:00:11] that know god is a creator they look
[1:00:13] around and they enjoy all the beauty of
[1:00:15] this valley in the mountains or and
[1:00:17] wherever the oceans and they know
[1:00:19] god created that
[1:00:21] but they only know him as a creator
[1:00:24] they don't know him
[1:00:26] as a savior
[1:00:29] so come on up you know him as a creator
[1:00:31] come up and learn know of him as a
[1:00:32] savior
[1:00:34] know of him as a redeemer
[1:00:36] know of him as a justifier that he will
[1:00:38] make that he will so forgive you of your
[1:00:40] sins that it is as though you've never
[1:00:42] ever done it in the first place
[1:00:44] and if you're justified in god there's
[1:00:46] more to him he's a sanctifier he cannot
[1:00:48] only forgive you for what you've done
[1:00:50] but he can take the very desire of your
[1:00:52] heart to do it again and once you know
[1:00:54] him as a justifier you then know him as
[1:00:56] a holy ghost filler and there's always
[1:00:58] something to know of him you trouble
[1:01:01] strikes the home you then know him as a
[1:01:03] defender you know him as a conqueror
[1:01:06] you get sick you then know him as a
[1:01:08] healer you lose someone is very dear to
[1:01:11] you you now know him as a comforter he
[1:01:13] begins to just unfold himself to you
[1:01:17] and i believe even in the millennium we
[1:01:18] will continue to learn of him he will
[1:01:21] continue to unfold himself of him of
[1:01:23] himself to us
[1:01:25] the book of revelation tells us that to
[1:01:27] him that overcometh will i get to eat of
[1:01:29] the hidden manna and will give him a
[1:01:30] white stone and in the stone a new name
[1:01:33] written which no man knoweth saving he
[1:01:36] that receiveth it so brother jim there's
[1:01:38] a name that he has for you
[1:01:41] on the other side after you've overcome
[1:01:43] this age that he's going to reward you
[1:01:45] with and no one's going to know it but
[1:01:47] you
[1:01:48] it's going to have to do with you
[1:01:50] overcoming brother graham said it could
[1:01:51] very well be our original names on the
[1:01:53] lamb's book of life
[1:01:54] and he's saving that for us
[1:01:57] and he said he there's always there's
[1:01:58] going to be a constant eternal unfolding
[1:02:00] he's just absolutely so wonderful
[1:02:04] so the first mention of a song in the
[1:02:05] bible is when moses when they were
[1:02:07] coming out of the out of the first
[1:02:09] exodus and they were coming out of egypt
[1:02:11] they had a red sea experience now
[1:02:13] redemption god is perfect
[1:02:16] god does not start something and then
[1:02:18] not finish it when that masterpiece in
[1:02:20] the garden of eden started and it fell
[1:02:22] fl and satan caused it to fall god
[1:02:24] didn't leave it there
[1:02:26] he raised it back up so when god starts
[1:02:28] a work in you he's gonna finish the work
[1:02:30] he knew so when he took the children of
[1:02:32] israel out of egypt he took them it has
[1:02:34] two parts out of
[1:02:36] and into something
[1:02:38] so if god takes you out of the world
[1:02:40] he's not going to just leave you sitting
[1:02:41] on the fence he's going to take you into
[1:02:43] christ
[1:02:44] if he if there was a voice in the center
[1:02:46] that said come out of her my people then
[1:02:48] we're to come out of the denominations
[1:02:50] and come into christ the word
[1:02:52] he would not tell you to come he would
[1:02:54] not tell us to call us out of something
[1:02:55] and then just leave us here he's going
[1:02:57] to bring us into something so he called
[1:03:00] israel out of egypt
[1:03:02] with the intention of bringing them into
[1:03:05] the promised land
[1:03:07] so in colossians 1 13 the bible says who
[1:03:09] hath delivered us
[1:03:11] from the power of darkness
[1:03:14] and hath translated us
[1:03:16] into the kingdom of his dear son
[1:03:19] most of us
[1:03:20] if not all of us at one point would did
[1:03:23] not want to be here
[1:03:24] would not have wanted to be here would
[1:03:26] not have come wanted to sit down for a
[1:03:28] couple hours or whatever it is in a
[1:03:29] church service we would never even dream
[1:03:31] of the idea
[1:03:33] you remember brother brown was ready to
[1:03:34] fight somebody for calling him a baptist
[1:03:36] preacher telling that he looked like a
[1:03:38] baptist preacher
[1:03:39] and then later after his conversion he
[1:03:41] said it's the greatest compliment
[1:03:42] someone could give them so we so god
[1:03:45] delivered us from the power of darkness
[1:03:47] and translated us into
[1:03:49] the kingdom of his dear son
[1:03:51] in whom we have redemption through his
[1:03:54] blood even the forgiveness of sins
[1:03:57] so as israel was coming through the red
[1:03:59] sea
[1:04:00] egypt god caused heart and pharaoh's
[1:04:03] heart and we all know the story and they
[1:04:04] begin to follow them into the red sea
[1:04:07] but god ordained that path
[1:04:10] for israel not for egypt
[1:04:13] that path was god's provided way in that
[1:04:16] first exodus for his called out people
[1:04:19] so i'd like to type the red sea this
[1:04:21] evening with the blood of jesus christ
[1:04:24] the blood of jesus is not for the devil
[1:04:26] the blood of jesus is not is not for
[1:04:28] demons and and wicked spirits the blood
[1:04:30] of jesus is for people is for whosoever
[1:04:32] will
[1:04:33] and that's who the blood of jesus is for
[1:04:36] so in exodus
[1:04:38] 14 21 and moses stretched out his hand
[1:04:41] over the sea and the lord caused the sea
[1:04:43] to go back by strong east wind all that
[1:04:46] night and may the sea dry land and the
[1:04:48] waters were divided and the children of
[1:04:50] israel went into the midst of the sea
[1:04:52] upon dry ground and the waters were a
[1:04:54] wall unto them
[1:04:56] on the right hand and on their left and
[1:04:58] the egyptians pursued
[1:05:00] and went in after them in the midst of
[1:05:03] the sea
[1:05:04] you talk about a hard-headed devil
[1:05:06] all them all in plagues that he had
[1:05:08] already had to to to endure and then
[1:05:11] he's actually going to think he's going
[1:05:13] to get them do you know what's often
[1:05:14] attributed to albert einstein as saying
[1:05:16] the definition of insanity
[1:05:18] is to do the same thing over and over
[1:05:21] and over again but expect a different
[1:05:22] result
[1:05:24] so satan is insane
[1:05:27] because he's had all the he's been
[1:05:29] defeated so many times again he tries
[1:05:31] again yet he tries again yet he tries
[1:05:33] again he was defeated in the first
[1:05:35] battle in heaven and he's gonna be
[1:05:37] defeated at the very end
[1:05:39] but yet he keeps trying he's insane
[1:05:43] how many times has he been cast out but
[1:05:45] he's still gonna try and come back
[1:05:49] so the devil is truly insane
[1:05:51] so moses stretched out his hand and we
[1:05:53] know that that is a sign of victory
[1:05:55] whenever god told him stretch out your
[1:05:56] hand and the ocean the red sea is going
[1:05:58] to go back and destroy the enemy and
[1:06:01] that is how we destroy the enemies when
[1:06:02] we give god the praise and we accept we
[1:06:04] respond to the word and we catch the
[1:06:07] word and we say thank you lord that is
[1:06:09] for me that begins to destroy the
[1:06:12] enemy's ground in our lives because
[1:06:15] footsteps mean possession
[1:06:18] and remember whenever he was fighting
[1:06:20] against the enemy there i think is the
[1:06:21] amalekites or someone where moses had to
[1:06:23] have his hand stretched and every time
[1:06:25] they went down the enemy would start
[1:06:27] winning but every time they were put up
[1:06:30] israel was winning
[1:06:34] so the blood of jesus will destroy every
[1:06:36] devil that tries to follow you
[1:06:39] because remember
[1:06:40] the blood of jesus is so powerful you
[1:06:43] say the blood of jesus is gone how it's
[1:06:45] the life behind the blood to add the
[1:06:47] literal blood of jesus right here and
[1:06:49] you make sure this is closed
[1:06:52] and you pour it all over you
[1:06:55] you pour it all over you it will not
[1:06:57] sanctify you
[1:07:00] okay it would not sanctify you the
[1:07:02] literal blood of jesus remember the
[1:07:04] romans got the blood on them when they
[1:07:05] were beating him to death
[1:07:08] the one that stuck him in the cider with
[1:07:09] the in the side with that spear got his
[1:07:11] blood on him but he was not sanctified
[1:07:13] he was not forgiven but those that
[1:07:15] believed on him after he done died went
[1:07:17] to hell conquered hell or raised
[1:07:20] like us
[1:07:22] we are the beneficiaries of the blood of
[1:07:25] jesus christ
[1:07:28] so satan can't cross the bloodline
[1:07:31] the blood
[1:07:33] is for you
[1:07:34] and your enemy whenever you dip
[1:07:36] something in the blood of jesus christ
[1:07:38] and ask god to forgive you god so breaks
[1:07:40] that apart
[1:07:42] is as though you've never done it
[1:07:44] now the blood is not to be trampled on
[1:07:46] the blood is not to be played with you
[1:07:48] say what what does playing with the
[1:07:49] blood mean playing with the blood would
[1:07:51] mean whenever you just use god
[1:07:54] as someone to just you do something
[1:07:56] premeditatingly
[1:07:58] and then you just use him as someone to
[1:08:00] just forgive me my sins i'm sorry lord
[1:08:02] but yet you don't really repent in your
[1:08:04] heart
[1:08:06] the blood is not sent for that
[1:08:09] our lord and savior
[1:08:11] did not shed his blood for that
[1:08:13] in the old testament there was something
[1:08:14] called city of refuge
[1:08:16] and what that was is god had moses set
[1:08:18] that up because they were under an eye
[1:08:20] for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and
[1:08:22] what would happen is if someone
[1:08:24] killed
[1:08:25] someone else
[1:08:27] the person the victims
[1:08:29] family with the and friends and
[1:08:31] associates would then begin to track you
[1:08:34] down
[1:08:35] to kill you for
[1:08:36] it so god had moses throughout whenever
[1:08:40] he had set up the the promised land he
[1:08:42] he forwarded to joshua and they set up
[1:08:45] cities of refuge so in other words it
[1:08:46] would be called in today's term as like
[1:08:49] involuntary
[1:08:51] manslaughter
[1:08:52] or something that that you actually did
[1:08:54] kill someone but you had nothing against
[1:08:57] them there was no history of you ever
[1:08:59] hating them there was nothing you were
[1:09:01] trying to take from them you did it
[1:09:03] accidentally
[1:09:05] there was a city that you could then run
[1:09:07] to and there were people there and that
[1:09:09] would be your protection and the people
[1:09:11] that were looking for your life they
[1:09:13] were called the avengers
[1:09:15] and the avengers could then as long as
[1:09:18] you could prove that you did not
[1:09:20] commit premeditated murder in our modern
[1:09:23] terms you were then safe in the city of
[1:09:25] refuge
[1:09:26] but if you if that person did actually
[1:09:29] commit it
[1:09:30] in a premeditated way they could take
[1:09:33] them out and stone them and kill them
[1:09:35] so the city of refuge the bible tells us
[1:09:37] in proverbs 18 10 the name of the lord
[1:09:41] is a strong tower
[1:09:42] the righteous run into it
[1:09:45] and is safe
[1:09:48] you'll find that everything in the bible
[1:09:49] points to jesus christ
[1:09:52] you can't get away from it every single
[1:09:54] every single story every single thing
[1:09:56] points to our precious lord and savior
[1:09:58] jesus christ so he is that city of
[1:10:00] refuge now it's interesting because
[1:10:03] whenever they were in them city of
[1:10:04] refuge they had to stay there and live
[1:10:07] there
[1:10:08] until the high priest died
[1:10:11] and then they could go out but the bible
[1:10:13] tells us that he is in high priests that
[1:10:16] abideth continually
[1:10:19] there's never a reason to leave this
[1:10:21] city a refuge
[1:10:22] so if tonight if if you are stuck in sin
[1:10:26] and satan has got you in sin but you
[1:10:28] don't mean to do it
[1:10:30] you don't you feel bad but yet satan has
[1:10:33] got you bound there's hope for you in
[1:10:36] the city of refuge
[1:10:37] but once you get in the city of refuge
[1:10:40] don't keep going in and out
[1:10:42] because the bible said that he that sins
[1:10:44] willfully there's no more sacrifice for
[1:10:46] sin but once you're in this city a
[1:10:47] refuge you've got to stay there
[1:10:51] for as long as the high priest is alive
[1:10:55] and our high priest the lord jesus
[1:10:57] christ
[1:10:58] can never die
[1:11:01] praise the lord
[1:11:03] so the blood is for you and not for the
[1:11:05] devil it completely completely
[1:11:08] annihilates sin
[1:11:10] in verse 27 and moses stretched forth
[1:11:12] his hand over the sea and the sea
[1:11:14] returned to his strength from the
[1:11:15] morning appeared and the egyptians fled
[1:11:17] against it and the lord overthrew the
[1:11:19] egyptians in the midst of the sea
[1:11:22] and the waters returned and covered the
[1:11:24] chariots and the horsemen and all the
[1:11:26] hosts of pharaoh that came into the sea
[1:11:27] after them there remained not so much as
[1:11:31] one of them
[1:11:33] there was no baggage on them when they
[1:11:34] came over
[1:11:37] the red sea killed every egyptian that
[1:11:40] followed them
[1:11:41] every devil that tries to follow you
[1:11:43] through the blood of jesus christ cannot
[1:11:45] get to you
[1:11:47] because it's your token it's your
[1:11:49] protection
[1:11:51] because you know what satan can't walk
[1:11:52] where you walk
[1:11:54] devils can't walk where you walk
[1:11:57] you've been called to a higher order
[1:11:58] you've been called to a higher walk
[1:12:01] as i said earlier satan
[1:12:04] lusts for the power that you possess in
[1:12:06] your soul if you have a holy ghost
[1:12:09] he can't get it
[1:12:11] and it makes him so mad
[1:12:13] but it makes us so glad
[1:12:16] so whenever
[1:12:17] moses was coming through and they in in
[1:12:19] this ocean just crashed back together
[1:12:21] and they began to see what god had done
[1:12:23] for them it inspired the first recorded
[1:12:26] song
[1:12:27] in the scriptures and we're going to
[1:12:29] read it in exodus 15.
[1:12:31] and see moses moses in israel
[1:12:34] experienced this journey
[1:12:37] it was not a second-handed religion they
[1:12:39] actually experienced the exodus they
[1:12:42] literally walked on dry ground and they
[1:12:45] literally seen
[1:12:46] the bodies of their tormentors
[1:12:49] floating on the water and that began to
[1:12:51] give them a new song
[1:12:54] it began to give them a new utterance of
[1:12:56] praise and thankfulness for what god had
[1:12:58] done for them
[1:13:00] then saying moses and the children of
[1:13:02] israel this song unto the lord and spake
[1:13:04] saying i will sing unto the lord for he
[1:13:07] hath triumphed gloriously the horse and
[1:13:09] his rider hath he thrown into the sea
[1:13:12] the lord is my strength and song and he
[1:13:14] has become my salvation he is my god and
[1:13:18] i will prepare him in habitation my
[1:13:20] father's god and i will exalt him the
[1:13:22] lord is a man of war the lord is his
[1:13:24] name pharaoh's chariots and his hosts
[1:13:26] have he cast into the sea his chosen
[1:13:29] captains also are drowned in the red sea
[1:13:31] the depths have covered them they sank
[1:13:33] into the bottom as a stone
[1:13:36] thy right hand oh lord has become
[1:13:37] glorious in power thy right hand o lord
[1:13:39] hath dashed in pieces the enemy and the
[1:13:42] greatness of thine excellency has thou
[1:13:45] and in the greatness of thine excellency
[1:13:47] has thou overthrown them that rose up
[1:13:48] against thee thou sentenced forth thy
[1:13:50] wrath which consumed them as stubble
[1:13:53] and with the blast of thy nostrils the
[1:13:55] waters were gathered together the flood
[1:13:57] stood upright as in heap and the deaths
[1:13:59] were congealed in the heart of the sea
[1:14:01] the enemy said i will pursue i will
[1:14:04] overtake i will divide the spoil my lust
[1:14:06] shall be satisfied upon them i will draw
[1:14:08] my sword my hand shall destroy them thou
[1:14:11] this bloweth i win the sea cover them
[1:14:13] they sink as lead in the mighty waters
[1:14:16] who is like unto thee oh lord among the
[1:14:18] gods who is like unto thee glorious and
[1:14:21] holiness fearful and praises doing
[1:14:22] wonders thou stretches out thy right
[1:14:24] hand the earth swallow them thou and i
[1:14:27] mercy has led forth the people which
[1:14:29] thou hast redeemed thou has guided them
[1:14:32] in the strength and thy strength unto
[1:14:33] thy holy habitation the people shall
[1:14:36] hear and be afraid sorrow shall take
[1:14:38] hold upon the inhabitants of palestinia
[1:14:41] then the dukes of edom shall be amazed
[1:14:43] the mighty men of moab trembling shall
[1:14:44] take hold upon them all the inhabitants
[1:14:47] of canaan shall melt away fear and dread
[1:14:49] shall fall upon them by the greatness of
[1:14:51] thine arm shall they be still as a stone
[1:14:54] to thy people passover o lord to the
[1:14:56] people passover which thou has purchased
[1:14:58] thou shalt bring them in and plant them
[1:15:00] in the mountain of thine inheritance in
[1:15:03] the place o lord which thou hast made
[1:15:04] for thee to dwell in
[1:15:06] in the sanctuary o lord which thy hands
[1:15:09] have established forever the lord shall
[1:15:11] reign forever and ever for the horse of
[1:15:14] pharaoh went in with his chariots and
[1:15:16] his horsemen into the sea and the lord
[1:15:18] brought again the waters of the sea upon
[1:15:20] them but the children of israel went on
[1:15:22] dry land in the midst of the sea praise
[1:15:25] the lord amen
[1:15:27] do you know that song it was mentioned
[1:15:29] all the way in the book of revelations
[1:15:31] moses brings it back up and this very
[1:15:33] event god did such a major event that
[1:15:36] all like when nate when the spies went
[1:15:38] over and spied out the land rahab
[1:15:41] said and admitted that our hearts have
[1:15:43] melted because of what we heard what god
[1:15:46] did for you in egypt
[1:15:48] that story
[1:15:49] that reputation so preceded them it
[1:15:52] began to make their enemies be afraid
[1:15:56] now it's very interesting because moses
[1:15:58] says the horse and his rider have he
[1:16:00] thrown into the sea and we know the book
[1:16:03] of revelations tells us that there's
[1:16:04] four horse riders
[1:16:07] there's the white horse there's the red
[1:16:09] horse the black horse and the pale horse
[1:16:10] and there's a rider he's an antichrist
[1:16:13] that gets on these horses and they're
[1:16:15] they're they wind through the church
[1:16:17] ages but yet the blood of jesus christ
[1:16:19] god's mercy to us has overthrown the
[1:16:22] influence of the horse riders upon our
[1:16:25] lives we're not deceived the elect
[1:16:27] cannot be deceived
[1:16:29] millions of angels were deceived by
[1:16:31] lucifer
[1:16:33] but the bride cannot be deceived
[1:16:36] the bride cannot be deceived the very
[1:16:38] angels that seen god unfold the planets
[1:16:41] roll the planets off of his mighty hand
[1:16:44] yet they were deceived by lucifer but
[1:16:47] you cannot be deceived
[1:16:49] you cannot be deceived why because the
[1:16:51] lord has thrown the horse and his rider
[1:16:55] into the sea
[1:16:56] he's got no influence on you the pel
[1:16:58] horse rider is riding around the land
[1:17:01] but he's got no influence on you because
[1:17:03] the lord has overthrown the rider and
[1:17:06] his seed
[1:17:08] he's overthrown them into the sea the
[1:17:10] blood of jesus christ amen praise the
[1:17:12] lord god looks out for his own
[1:17:14] god looks out for his own brother and
[1:17:16] talks about as the eagle stirs her nest
[1:17:18] and he's and he said let a coyote get
[1:17:20] after one of them eaglets you watch the
[1:17:22] mama just flog him to death
[1:17:26] oh my goodness
[1:17:28] god is so good
[1:17:30] now watch what happens
[1:17:32] whenever moses began to sing this song
[1:17:35] brother matthew he began to sing this
[1:17:37] song that began to then inspire others
[1:17:40] miriam then took
[1:17:42] the tambourine and she began to shake it
[1:17:45] and i want us to notice and mary and the
[1:17:46] prophetess the sister of aaron took a
[1:17:49] timber on her hand and all the women
[1:17:51] went out after her with timbrels and
[1:17:54] with dances
[1:17:56] and miriam answer them
[1:17:58] sing ye to the lord for he hath
[1:18:01] triumphed gloriously the horse and his
[1:18:03] rider have he thrown it to the sea she
[1:18:06] just said the same thing moses just said
[1:18:08] because she experienced the same thing
[1:18:10] moses experienced she went through the
[1:18:12] red sea of the blood just like moses did
[1:18:16] now god sent us a prophet in this end
[1:18:17] time and he was a law giver like moses
[1:18:20] he went up in the mountain and received
[1:18:22] commandments of the lord like moses
[1:18:24] he was a man of the desert like moses
[1:18:26] he's seen the pillar of fire like moses
[1:18:30] but yet we have to experience the same
[1:18:33] thing that he experienced now we're not
[1:18:35] called to have the same message or or to
[1:18:38] preach the message that's already been
[1:18:39] given the fivefold ministry does preach
[1:18:41] the message but we aren't called for
[1:18:43] them gifts
[1:18:45] like he was called but you are called to
[1:18:48] meet the same god you are called to meet
[1:18:50] the same i am you are called to meet the
[1:18:52] same pillar of fire you are called to be
[1:18:55] cleansed by the same blood you are
[1:18:57] called to have the same holy ghost
[1:18:59] god don't love brother brahm no more
[1:19:01] than he loves you
[1:19:04] god called him as a as a prophet of the
[1:19:06] age
[1:19:08] and that's the prophetic office that he
[1:19:09] held but he had to overcome in his
[1:19:11] personal life just like you do and just
[1:19:13] like i do
[1:19:16] so miriam is the type of the bride and
[1:19:18] she then repeats
[1:19:20] the word that has already been
[1:19:22] preached sung by a vindicated prophet so
[1:19:26] whenever the same task masters that
[1:19:27] moses had was the same task masters that
[1:19:30] miriam had
[1:19:31] the same width that my that beat moses
[1:19:33] when he went back to his brethren was
[1:19:34] the same width that beat mario the same
[1:19:36] temper brother branham had to overcome
[1:19:38] the same temper that some of us have to
[1:19:40] overcome so whenever they're floating
[1:19:42] like i can imagine mary man she's as
[1:19:44] she's running and dancing and whenever
[1:19:46] she was struck with that inspiration to
[1:19:47] sing a song to the lord she runs and she
[1:19:50] and she sees them then they're floating
[1:19:51] head they're floating face down into the
[1:19:54] in the water
[1:19:55] so she picks one of them up and she
[1:19:57] recognizes them he beat me
[1:19:59] i remember him
[1:20:02] she runs over here she picks up this one
[1:20:04] i remember him what he did to my sister
[1:20:07] and what do we do in this end time we
[1:20:09] run on the other side of the blood and
[1:20:10] we pick up we say that was fear
[1:20:13] that one used to beat me
[1:20:16] that right there that's a line spirit
[1:20:18] and that one that used to have a hold on
[1:20:20] me
[1:20:22] that right there it was that's a temper
[1:20:25] that's a lust spirit
[1:20:26] but i've been delivered
[1:20:28] and it begins to give us a song of
[1:20:31] deliverance
[1:20:33] it begins to make us shout and praise
[1:20:35] the lord
[1:20:39] because we don't we've overcome
[1:20:42] by the blood of the lamb
[1:20:48] so it gives us a song
[1:20:50] because remember
[1:20:52] brother and said that the bride would be
[1:20:53] the final voice to the final age under
[1:20:55] her messenger
[1:20:57] so miriam was a prophetess just like the
[1:21:00] bride so when so she repeated the same
[1:21:02] thing brother she repeated the same
[1:21:04] thing brother moses said
[1:21:06] and she had the same victory
[1:21:08] that he had
[1:21:15] she had the same victory she experienced
[1:21:17] the same salvation same born-again
[1:21:19] experience we
[1:21:21] experienced the same born-again
[1:21:22] experience that brother branham had
[1:21:25] do you know whenever jacob whenever he
[1:21:27] was running from the lord
[1:21:28] up until he wrestled with that angel he
[1:21:30] was on god was only the god of abraham
[1:21:32] and isaac
[1:21:34] jacob didn't know him as the god of
[1:21:36] abraham isaac and himself and jacob it
[1:21:39] took a wrestling with the angel and he
[1:21:40] then began then he knew god as abraham
[1:21:43] and not not just his dad and
[1:21:45] grandparents grandpa's the god but as
[1:21:47] his god
[1:21:49] we can't know this message
[1:21:51] just by the god of our the message of
[1:21:53] our parents the message of our pastors
[1:21:55] the message of the ministry we've got to
[1:21:57] know this as our message it is jesus
[1:22:00] christ the same yesterday today
[1:22:03] and forever
[1:22:06] same salvation same holy
[1:22:08] ghost we've got to find our place in the
[1:22:11] same book just like brother brahm did
[1:22:14] we've got to find our name written in
[1:22:15] the book just like he did
[1:22:17] because remember it's a family album
[1:22:20] god cannot be separated from his word
[1:22:22] in the old testament god gave moses the
[1:22:25] tabernacle of witness and he had it set
[1:22:27] up and it was a reflection of heaven
[1:22:29] there was there was there was a holy of
[1:22:31] holies and there was a laver and you can
[1:22:32] find all this terminology all the way in
[1:22:34] the book of revelations you'll find that
[1:22:36] the word what you find in genesis you'll
[1:22:39] find all the way in revelation
[1:22:42] and that that is how the that's how the
[1:22:44] truth works
[1:22:45] it's like a scarlet thread
[1:22:47] so the ark was something that was very
[1:22:50] well guarded for israel it was something
[1:22:51] that was very sacred
[1:22:53] the ark was very sacred by the mark
[1:22:55] because the ark contained the word
[1:22:57] and whenever they said of the tabernacle
[1:22:59] of witness that is where the pillar of
[1:23:00] fire would come down and it would settle
[1:23:02] over where the word was which is where
[1:23:05] the law that god gave to moses up in the
[1:23:07] mountain
[1:23:08] they put it in that ark and god would
[1:23:10] come down and he'd begin to speak to
[1:23:12] moses
[1:23:14] so the ark was actually israel's secret
[1:23:16] to success
[1:23:17] in their battles they would always take
[1:23:19] the ark with them
[1:23:21] they would always take the ark and
[1:23:22] whenever they wouldn't have the ark like
[1:23:24] whenever the spies went out to spy the
[1:23:26] land they said we can't do it we can't
[1:23:27] do it there and i think it's number 14
[1:23:30] they then once god pronounced judgment
[1:23:32] and said for every day you went over
[1:23:34] there
[1:23:34] for 40 days to spy out the land you're
[1:23:36] going to wander through this wilderness
[1:23:38] for 40 years
[1:23:40] well then the unbeliever started feeling
[1:23:41] really bad if he got so convicted but
[1:23:43] god had already spoken it so they then
[1:23:45] said okay we're very sorry we're going
[1:23:47] to go up there and we're going to go
[1:23:48] we're going to attack in the morning
[1:23:49] moses said don't do it
[1:23:51] they went up there they presumed they
[1:23:53] went up there themselves without the ark
[1:23:55] and they were killed
[1:23:58] the ark
[1:23:59] was israel's the enemy was always trying
[1:24:01] to capture the ark
[1:24:03] because it contained the word and the
[1:24:05] word is our secret weapon
[1:24:07] just like samson he had an azerite vow
[1:24:09] of his hair
[1:24:10] our nazarite vow is the word
[1:24:13] that is where satan got eve is when she
[1:24:15] got off the word that's where the only
[1:24:17] way that satan could ever get to any one
[1:24:19] of us
[1:24:20] is get off that word
[1:24:22] as long as you stay behind that word
[1:24:24] satan can't touch you
[1:24:28] so during the days of eli they're in
[1:24:30] first and second samuel the ark was
[1:24:31] actually captured they began to let down
[1:24:33] the bars eli was a priest and he began
[1:24:36] to he he began to turn his head his sons
[1:24:38] were doing very evil things and taking
[1:24:39] bribes and things and he was turning his
[1:24:41] head at what his sons were doing and he
[1:24:44] wasn't upholding the word like he should
[1:24:46] have so the the the story goes the
[1:24:48] philistines came and they actually took
[1:24:50] the ark
[1:24:52] and it caused israel to get demoralized
[1:24:54] so bad
[1:24:56] but after a while the ark was then the
[1:24:58] god plagued the philistines for taking
[1:25:00] the ark
[1:25:01] and then it began to be to work its way
[1:25:04] back to israel you can read about it
[1:25:05] like i said first and second same it
[1:25:07] began to work its way back into israel
[1:25:09] but it wasn't ever in quite in divine
[1:25:11] order like it was at the beginning it
[1:25:12] was in people's houses or it was here or
[1:25:14] it was there well david became king and
[1:25:17] became anointed and after a while god
[1:25:19] put in david's heart i want the ark back
[1:25:21] in its place
[1:25:23] you know david david said i live in a
[1:25:25] cedar house i live in a wood house and
[1:25:27] it's wonderful and i'm so comfortable
[1:25:29] and how is that that the ark of my god
[1:25:31] is just
[1:25:32] thrown about
[1:25:34] so he had a desire to bring the ark of
[1:25:35] the lord back
[1:25:37] so when one whenever he had everything
[1:25:39] set up and they were bringing they were
[1:25:40] bringing the ark back david got a little
[1:25:43] excited
[1:25:44] david actually got very excited
[1:25:47] and he danced for 17 miles because the
[1:25:50] word was being restored now we know that
[1:25:53] david was a great psalmist so whenever
[1:25:55] he seen that the word after all these
[1:25:57] years was coming back to the place where
[1:26:00] it was supposed to be
[1:26:02] he got excited
[1:26:04] people wonder what we're so excited
[1:26:06] about is because we see the word and it
[1:26:08] is returned back to its place it's been
[1:26:10] a restoration of the word
[1:26:12] it's it's been in the land of the
[1:26:13] philistines and denominations long
[1:26:15] enough it's now come back to its place
[1:26:18] it's come back to the original
[1:26:22] that's what we're so excited about
[1:26:25] in first chronicles 15 so david and the
[1:26:27] elders of israel and the captains over
[1:26:29] thousands went to bring up the ark of
[1:26:31] the covenant of the lord out of the
[1:26:32] house of obedient with joy and it came
[1:26:35] to pass when god helped the levites that
[1:26:37] bear the ark of the covenant of the lord
[1:26:39] that they offered seven bullocks and
[1:26:40] seven rams and david was was clothed
[1:26:43] with a robe of fine linen and all the
[1:26:45] levites that bear the ark and the
[1:26:46] singers in chennai the master of the
[1:26:48] song with singers
[1:26:50] see there's always songs there's always
[1:26:52] worship
[1:26:53] david also had upon him an ephod of
[1:26:55] linen thus all israel brought up the ark
[1:26:58] of the covenant of the lord with
[1:26:59] shouting and with the sound of the
[1:27:01] coronet and with trumpets and with
[1:27:02] symbols making a noise with sultries and
[1:27:05] harps
[1:27:06] and it came to pass as the ark of the
[1:27:08] covenant of the lord came to the city of
[1:27:10] david that mikhail the daughter of saul
[1:27:12] looking out at a window
[1:27:14] saw king david dancing and playing and
[1:27:17] she despised him in her heart
[1:27:21] she seen
[1:27:22] as david the king
[1:27:25] was he was supposed to be a dignified
[1:27:27] king and he was over there showing off
[1:27:29] his legs and dancing and shouting and
[1:27:31] embarrassing
[1:27:33] her
[1:27:36] do you know the prophet of god said that
[1:27:38] and the bible also speaks that god
[1:27:39] closed her womb
[1:27:42] god cursed her for doing that and
[1:27:46] there's people that criticize
[1:27:49] this message
[1:27:51] there's people that criticize are
[1:27:53] rejoicing over the open word
[1:27:57] and god closes their spiritual womb
[1:28:00] they can't receive seed anymore they
[1:28:02] can't receive the word the spoken word
[1:28:04] is the original seed and they just go
[1:28:06] out into the world
[1:28:09] because they're critical
[1:28:11] because we're rejoicing because the word
[1:28:13] has been restored that's something if
[1:28:15] i'll say this because i feel impressed
[1:28:17] to say it if you ever get over the
[1:28:19] revealing of the word and the
[1:28:21] restoration of the word you have
[1:28:22] backslidden
[1:28:24] that is something that you should never
[1:28:27] ever get over
[1:28:29] that's right the prophet of god called
[1:28:31] revelations 5 when he came i don't know
[1:28:33] hopefully we'll get to it when he came
[1:28:35] and took the book as the most sublime
[1:28:37] scripture
[1:28:38] in all the bible is when he came and
[1:28:40] took that book because if he hadn't done
[1:28:43] that we wouldn't be here
[1:28:46] so the ark was a representation of god
[1:28:48] in their midst
[1:28:50] brother brahm in the church age book
[1:28:51] said he's quoting he said i am the word
[1:28:54] jesus speaking if you want deity in your
[1:28:57] midst
[1:28:58] then welcome and receive the word
[1:29:02] don't ever let anyone or anything get
[1:29:06] between you in that word
[1:29:09] if you want god in your home
[1:29:11] get the word
[1:29:13] if you want god in your life receive the
[1:29:15] word
[1:29:17] because the spirit will channel itself
[1:29:19] through the word
[1:29:21] he said
[1:29:23] that which i'm giving you the word is a
[1:29:25] revelation of myself i am the word
[1:29:27] remember that i wonder if we are
[1:29:29] sufficiently impressed
[1:29:31] with the word in our midst
[1:29:34] because remember true emotion
[1:29:37] emotion is not an evidence of anything
[1:29:40] you had in the old testament whenever
[1:29:41] israel came out and they made remember
[1:29:43] moses was in the mountain and they got
[1:29:44] aaron to make that that uh idol
[1:29:48] and they were all dancing and shouting
[1:29:50] and just having such a good time at the
[1:29:51] idol god wasn't in that
[1:29:54] the 400 hebrew the 400 prophets in
[1:29:56] israel whenever they had that mount uh
[1:29:58] carmel showdown over there they were
[1:30:00] cutting themselves and jumping up and
[1:30:01] down and being emotional emotion is not
[1:30:03] an evidence
[1:30:05] it is a side effect
[1:30:07] our emotion is word based
[1:30:10] now whenever the word gets you to
[1:30:12] shouting and jumping and and praising
[1:30:14] the lord you've got something
[1:30:16] but we don't major on the emotion but we
[1:30:19] certainly because remember if your
[1:30:20] religion ain't got some emotion some
[1:30:21] life in it brother and said you should
[1:30:22] bury it
[1:30:24] we have we believe in emotion
[1:30:27] but that's not the evidence of anything
[1:30:31] the evidence is the life that you live
[1:30:33] whenever we receive the word
[1:30:36] whenever you receive the word it then
[1:30:38] bears fruit
[1:30:41] that's the evidence
[1:30:44] because remember even jesus when he came
[1:30:45] he said in vain
[1:30:47] they do worship me
[1:30:49] in vain
[1:30:51] so if you're writing scriptures down you
[1:30:52] can read after after this after the the
[1:30:55] ark comes back in first chronicles 16
[1:30:57] david there writes a song
[1:30:59] you'll find there's so many examples and
[1:31:01] there's so many we're not going to get
[1:31:02] to because the sake of time but there's
[1:31:04] so many examples whenever the word comes
[1:31:06] back god does something it then causes a
[1:31:09] stir to that generation
[1:31:12] it starts a revival to that generation
[1:31:14] they write songs about it
[1:31:16] i appreciate songs and i love singing
[1:31:19] but there's something special
[1:31:21] about a song that's written by someone
[1:31:23] in the bride have y'all ever experienced
[1:31:24] that
[1:31:26] that it's something so special like you
[1:31:28] you get blessed and many times people
[1:31:29] get under such the inspiration of say
[1:31:32] the nominal church and they get inspired
[1:31:33] and they write they pin a song and then
[1:31:35] when a person gets up here and sings it
[1:31:37] it takes on a whole new meaning
[1:31:42] because there's a life behind that song
[1:31:46] that's the key
[1:31:47] so after so first chronicles 16 you can
[1:31:49] read more about the david song but then
[1:31:51] one day solomon
[1:31:53] he built a temple for the lord
[1:31:55] and it took seven years to build that
[1:31:57] temple just like it took seven church
[1:31:59] ages for god to rebuild his temple
[1:32:01] remember the final
[1:32:04] the final revelation of the word
[1:32:07] ends up
[1:32:08] in flesh
[1:32:10] that's where god wants to dwell
[1:32:13] god's plan is not to dwell in buildings
[1:32:15] god's plan he's unfolding himself and he
[1:32:17] allowed it but he's getting closer and
[1:32:19] closer to flesh
[1:32:21] so the word that the ark jesus christ
[1:32:24] type the ark so when he died and sent
[1:32:27] back the holy ghost now we can all be
[1:32:29] like like many arks if you will we can
[1:32:31] all have the word of god within us
[1:32:34] and we can have the pillar of fire over
[1:32:35] our own lives
[1:32:37] because of the holy ghost so when
[1:32:40] solomon is dedicating the temple he
[1:32:42] begins to pray and he has everything in
[1:32:43] order and you can you can read about it
[1:32:45] in second chronicles five and the second
[1:32:47] kings eight i believe it is and then
[1:32:49] they have everything in order and it
[1:32:50] took seven years and everything is just
[1:32:52] so
[1:32:52] perfect and then solomon goes to
[1:32:55] dedicate the temple
[1:32:57] in the second chronicles chapter 5 verse
[1:33:00] 13 and it came to pass
[1:33:02] as the trumpeters and singers were as
[1:33:04] one to make one sound to be heard and
[1:33:07] praising and thanking the lord and when
[1:33:08] they lifted up their voice with the
[1:33:10] trumpets and symbols and instruments of
[1:33:12] music and praise the lord saying for he
[1:33:14] is good for his mercy endureth forever
[1:33:16] that then
[1:33:19] the house was filled with a cloud even
[1:33:22] the house of the lord
[1:33:24] so that the priest could not stand to
[1:33:26] minister by reason of the cloud for the
[1:33:28] glory of the lord had filled the house
[1:33:31] that's exactly what happened brother
[1:33:33] mark whenever moses dedicated the temple
[1:33:35] the same thing happened the glory of god
[1:33:37] came down and they couldn't even stand
[1:33:39] to minister
[1:33:40] that sounds like acts 2.
[1:33:42] on the day of pentecost and when the day
[1:33:44] of pentecost was fully come they were
[1:33:45] all in one accord in one place and there
[1:33:48] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[1:33:50] as of a rushing mighty wind and it
[1:33:52] filled all the house where they were
[1:33:54] sitting
[1:33:54] and they appeared unto them cloven
[1:33:56] tongues like has a fire and it sat upon
[1:33:59] each one of them and they begin to
[1:34:01] stagger and to act like drunk people
[1:34:04] they couldn't even stand under that
[1:34:05] presence of god that dropped down that
[1:34:08] is the fulfillment of what happened in
[1:34:10] solomon's temple that this right there
[1:34:12] in acts 2 that is what god wants that is
[1:34:16] god's desire
[1:34:18] and you that's been filled with the holy
[1:34:20] ghost that is god's desire that it was
[1:34:23] his desire from the very beginning
[1:34:25] that is why he went immediately down to
[1:34:28] adam and eve
[1:34:30] and he promised them that he would come
[1:34:32] in flesh right there in the garden of
[1:34:34] eden he didn't wait
[1:34:35] he promised that he'd come immediately
[1:34:37] he gave the promise of the savior there
[1:34:39] in the garden of eden
[1:34:40] immediately
[1:34:42] because he was not going to have his
[1:34:45] masters his masterpiece spoiled
[1:34:49] the bride of jesus christ is god's
[1:34:51] masterpiece
[1:34:54] she's been struck out of the churches
[1:34:58] she's been kicked out
[1:35:00] nobody wants nothing to do with her
[1:35:03] she's called fanatic she's called a cult
[1:35:06] she's called the branamite
[1:35:09] she's called all men holy roller all
[1:35:12] manner of evil things she's called
[1:35:16] but that doesn't change the fact
[1:35:20] that doesn't change a fact because do
[1:35:22] you remember
[1:35:23] whenever moses
[1:35:25] whenever michelangelo struck that
[1:35:27] brother ron had it right up here
[1:35:29] remember whenever michelangelo struck
[1:35:32] the knee what did he say
[1:35:34] he said speak
[1:35:37] what does revelations 10 tell us that
[1:35:39] brian's going to do prophesy again
[1:35:42] struck out of the church struck out of
[1:35:44] the world nobody wants her
[1:35:46] but she's speaking
[1:35:48] the bride's got something to say
[1:35:51] she's got something to say it's
[1:35:53] something that was already been said
[1:35:54] under her messenger
[1:35:57] but she's got something to say
[1:36:00] you know david in psalm 137
[1:36:04] this was before they were carried off in
[1:36:06] babylon
[1:36:07] but david picked up picked up on it in
[1:36:09] prophecy form
[1:36:11] it's very important it'd be very good
[1:36:12] for you to understand the history of
[1:36:14] israel because
[1:36:15] she had
[1:36:17] the presence of god in her
[1:36:19] she then backslid and was carried away
[1:36:22] into captivity into babylon
[1:36:24] and then after 70 years god promised
[1:36:27] brother gabriel that she would return
[1:36:29] back to her original land
[1:36:33] so that is an exact
[1:36:35] type of this bride
[1:36:37] that is an exact type of our journey as
[1:36:40] the bride that on the day of pentecost
[1:36:42] they had the unadulterated word of god
[1:36:46] then the antichrist spirit began to work
[1:36:47] and influence the word
[1:36:50] and men begin to inject their own ideas
[1:36:52] and it got so bad in the dark ages
[1:36:54] imagine this it got so bad in the dark
[1:36:56] ages people couldn't even read the bible
[1:36:58] for themselves
[1:36:59] the catholic church seen it seen it in
[1:37:01] their best interest to keep people from
[1:37:04] reading the word
[1:37:06] so the only way the common people like
[1:37:09] us
[1:37:10] would know what the word said is when a
[1:37:12] priest got up to tell us what the word
[1:37:14] said that's right so if the priest got
[1:37:17] up and said you've got god said that
[1:37:19] you've got to come and you've got to
[1:37:20] confess all your sins to me
[1:37:23] or you've got to give whenever whenever
[1:37:26] you die you got to leave what you have
[1:37:28] left to the church
[1:37:31] or you've got to do this or do that or
[1:37:34] do this and do that in the other
[1:37:36] the people didn't know because the bible
[1:37:38] was written in latin that is what made
[1:37:39] the reformation such an earth-shaking
[1:37:42] praise the lord
[1:37:44] wonderful thing
[1:37:47] amen that's what made it a wonderful
[1:37:49] thing
[1:37:51] that that's that's what made it go out
[1:37:53] like that okay because all of a sudden
[1:37:56] martin luther took it upon himself to
[1:37:58] begin to translate the bible into the
[1:38:01] common people's language which was
[1:38:02] german so then people could then begin
[1:38:04] to get the bible for themselves and say
[1:38:05] wait a minute i don't have to confess my
[1:38:08] sins to you
[1:38:10] the bible tells me that the just shall
[1:38:11] live by faith
[1:38:13] and he's the one
[1:38:15] that gives me the salvation not the
[1:38:17] church
[1:38:18] so that began a reformation so god began
[1:38:20] restoring
[1:38:22] the church
[1:38:23] and in the end time god then sent this
[1:38:27] message god then sent a prophet to
[1:38:29] restore all the truths that have been
[1:38:31] hidden
[1:38:33] because remember the amount of faith
[1:38:35] that you have the amount of word that's
[1:38:36] been given for a certain age is directly
[1:38:39] tied to the amount of faith they can
[1:38:40] have
[1:38:42] martin luther didn't have all the words
[1:38:44] so he couldn't take a rapture
[1:38:47] john wesley didn't have all the words so
[1:38:49] they couldn't take a rapture the
[1:38:51] pentecostals didn't have all the word
[1:38:52] they had more but they didn't have all
[1:38:53] of it take the rapture we've got all of
[1:38:56] it revealed to us that is why we can
[1:38:58] take a rapture because we have the
[1:39:00] faithful rapture it's a rapturing faith
[1:39:02] and a rapturing message
[1:39:04] to give to take us out of here
[1:39:08] so in psalm 137 david picks up in
[1:39:10] prophecy form
[1:39:12] that they're going to be carried over to
[1:39:13] babylon
[1:39:15] he said by the rivers of babylon
[1:39:17] there we sat down
[1:39:19] yea we wept when we remembered zion
[1:39:23] we hanged our harps upon the willows in
[1:39:25] the midst thereof for there they that
[1:39:28] carried us away captive required of us a
[1:39:30] song
[1:39:31] and they that wasted us required of us
[1:39:34] mirth
[1:39:35] saying sing
[1:39:37] us one of the songs of zion
[1:39:39] how shall we sing the lord's song in a
[1:39:41] strange land
[1:39:43] you can't sing this song in the world
[1:39:47] you can't sing the song of this glorious
[1:39:49] message in the denominational church
[1:39:52] it's not the people it's the system
[1:39:54] that's keeping them bound that's why god
[1:39:56] sent us a voice in that since time in
[1:39:58] time that said come out of her
[1:40:00] my people that ye be not partakers of
[1:40:03] her sins
[1:40:05] because the churches the church world is
[1:40:08] judged
[1:40:09] and the bible uses does not pull any
[1:40:11] punches on what kind of woman she is
[1:40:14] now i'm gonna say something strong but
[1:40:16] you adults will understand
[1:40:18] okay
[1:40:20] the
[1:40:20] church why does god call her an
[1:40:23] ill-famed woman
[1:40:25] because the womb for a married woman is
[1:40:28] only meant for the seed of her husband
[1:40:31] that's it
[1:40:33] so the church spiritually speaking is
[1:40:36] supposed to only receive the original
[1:40:38] spoken word seed of god
[1:40:40] but what does she do like an ill-famed
[1:40:42] woman she lets every kind of man's seed
[1:40:44] come in her
[1:40:46] do you see the spiritual application so
[1:40:48] god pulls no punches
[1:40:50] he's got judgment waiting for her so the
[1:40:53] call is now to come out of the system
[1:40:56] we have no law but love
[1:40:59] no creed but christ and no book of the
[1:41:02] bible
[1:41:04] there's no book there's no kind of
[1:41:06] membership for us to join
[1:41:08] there's no nothing freely as you come
[1:41:10] freely give free we just we believe
[1:41:12] god's word
[1:41:15] and we believe this message
[1:41:17] with all our hearts
[1:41:22] i'm just going to mention the scripture
[1:41:23] here y'all can i don't think we're going
[1:41:24] to get to it but as in ezra 3 when
[1:41:25] they're laying down the foundation again
[1:41:27] of the house how the people rejoice and
[1:41:29] they begin to to sing unto the lord they
[1:41:31] rejoice
[1:41:32] because they see god's order coming back
[1:41:35] in ephesians 2 19 now therefore you are
[1:41:38] no more
[1:41:39] strangers and foreigners but fellow
[1:41:40] citizens with the saints and of the
[1:41:42] household of god
[1:41:44] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:41:46] apostles and prophets jesus christ
[1:41:48] himself being the chief cornerstone in
[1:41:50] whom all the building fitly joined fitly
[1:41:53] frame together groweth into a holy
[1:41:55] temple in the lord see you're god's holy
[1:41:57] temple
[1:42:00] you're god's holy temple the presence of
[1:42:02] god is in this place because you brought
[1:42:04] him
[1:42:06] that is why he's in this place
[1:42:10] in whom ye also are builded together for
[1:42:13] an habitation
[1:42:15] of god through the spirit
[1:42:17] in john 14 god jesus says and i will
[1:42:20] pray the father and he shall give you
[1:42:21] another comforter that he may abide with
[1:42:23] you forever
[1:42:24] even the spirit of truth and the world
[1:42:26] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[1:42:28] neither know with him but ye know him
[1:42:31] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[1:42:33] you
[1:42:34] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[1:42:36] come to you
[1:42:38] see god condescending down
[1:42:41] being to be one of the original
[1:42:44] nobody would be a jude and nobody wants
[1:42:46] to be a judas to be the original 11 one
[1:42:47] of the 11 disciples would be a wonderful
[1:42:49] thing
[1:42:52] but
[1:42:53] having him in you is a whole lot better
[1:42:55] than having him with you
[1:42:57] they experienced that on the day of
[1:42:58] pentecost think you can love your spouse
[1:43:01] so much brother jerry you can you can
[1:43:03] you can love your spouse so much but but
[1:43:05] yet there's another level god loved us
[1:43:08] so much but yet you cannot
[1:43:11] live in them
[1:43:15] but god takes it to another level and he
[1:43:17] can live in you
[1:43:19] and that's what the holy ghost is is the
[1:43:21] life of god in you
[1:43:24] yet a little while i love this yet a
[1:43:26] little while and the world seeth me no
[1:43:28] more the world
[1:43:29] they don't want god
[1:43:31] they don't see god
[1:43:34] but yet as i said at the beginning of
[1:43:35] the service yet we're enjoying the
[1:43:37] praises and the blessings and the
[1:43:38] presence of god and he's changing our
[1:43:40] lives
[1:43:42] he's changing us out there the little
[1:43:44] hell has come up
[1:43:46] has come off so if the bible says that
[1:43:48] when the enemy comes in like a flood and
[1:43:50] the spirit of god raises the standard
[1:43:51] against it so if hell has come up
[1:43:54] and the enemy has come in like a flood
[1:43:56] then there's got to be a standard
[1:43:58] against it and that means heaven has
[1:43:59] come down
[1:44:01] that means heaven has come down in the
[1:44:03] form of his word to incarnate you the
[1:44:05] bride
[1:44:08] now one day there was a young teenage
[1:44:10] girl
[1:44:11] and we talked a lot about her
[1:44:13] and we should
[1:44:15] but her name was mary
[1:44:17] and she was walking one day and just
[1:44:19] doing the mundane just going to work
[1:44:21] in her way just doing about her daily
[1:44:23] chores nothing out of the ordinary but
[1:44:26] she met she had a very different morning
[1:44:28] that morning
[1:44:29] she met an angel of god
[1:44:31] and she believed that angel and she
[1:44:34] believed the word that the angel had had
[1:44:36] spoken to her
[1:44:39] now she had a cousin
[1:44:41] and she had a cousin her name was
[1:44:43] elizabeth and she was pregnant with john
[1:44:45] at that time but there was no movement
[1:44:48] john was basically dead in her womb
[1:44:52] but yet mary because she believed the
[1:44:54] word of an angel
[1:44:56] she went and she testified of what the
[1:44:59] angel had told her
[1:45:01] the angel came and said
[1:45:03] hail mary and you know the story and
[1:45:05] begin to talk to her and begin to to go
[1:45:08] into the scripture about a virgin shall
[1:45:09] conceive
[1:45:11] and mary said be it unto me according to
[1:45:13] your word
[1:45:16] and she went and she repeated what the
[1:45:19] angel told her
[1:45:20] to her cousin elizabeth and it brought
[1:45:22] her life
[1:45:24] it brought elizabeth life
[1:45:26] because remember the angel told the
[1:45:28] angel gabriel which types brother
[1:45:29] branham came to the virgin mary and told
[1:45:32] her
[1:45:33] the word
[1:45:35] mary believed the word
[1:45:37] and she believed the spoken word and she
[1:45:39] literally conceived by hearing the
[1:45:42] spoken word
[1:45:44] that is how
[1:45:46] we receive the word
[1:45:48] that is how we bear jesus christ our
[1:45:50] generation is by receiving the word from
[1:45:53] an angel
[1:45:55] so then we go so mary goes and she's all
[1:45:57] excited and she goes to her cousin
[1:45:59] elizabeth and she says that you know i
[1:46:01] met an angel and and he told me that i'd
[1:46:03] have a baby without knowing no man and
[1:46:05] that his name was jesus
[1:46:08] and as soon as elizabeth heard the name
[1:46:10] jesus
[1:46:12] she was filled with the holy ghost so
[1:46:15] was john
[1:46:16] in
[1:46:17] in her womb and it brought life to her
[1:46:19] because she repeated
[1:46:21] the same testimony the same word that
[1:46:24] she received from an angel
[1:46:30] and it brought life and the holy ghost
[1:46:32] to a dead woman
[1:46:34] that's what the bride ministry does
[1:46:36] can't you see it
[1:46:38] the final voice under her messenger is
[1:46:40] the final voice of the final age and as
[1:46:42] the word is preached you receive the
[1:46:44] word
[1:46:45] and it brings life to you
[1:46:48] because you receive the word
[1:46:51] life channels through the word
[1:46:53] and then it brings about a praise it
[1:46:55] brings about a new song what kind of
[1:46:57] song do you think brother ron's gonna
[1:46:58] have after his body lines up to the word
[1:47:02] what kind of song do we have if you've
[1:47:04] gotten the holy ghost
[1:47:06] and the life that you live
[1:47:08] you've got a whole brand new testimony
[1:47:10] you've got a whole brand new song
[1:47:13] what kind of song do you have when
[1:47:15] you're when your kids come to the lord
[1:47:17] what kind of song do you have whenever
[1:47:18] your child receives the holy ghost
[1:47:20] what kind of song do you have whenever
[1:47:22] your loved ones are healed whenever
[1:47:24] you're healed god with every victory god
[1:47:26] gives a song
[1:47:30] because you even find mary after she got
[1:47:32] pregnant by the spoken word of an angel
[1:47:34] she had a song
[1:47:36] the bible scofield calls it magnificat
[1:47:38] which means an utterance of praise let's
[1:47:40] read it luke 1.
[1:47:42] and mary said
[1:47:44] 146.
[1:47:45] and mary said my soul just magnify the
[1:47:48] lord and my spirit hath rejoice in god
[1:47:51] my savior for he hath regarded the
[1:47:53] lowest state of his handmaiden for
[1:47:54] behold all from henceforth all
[1:47:57] generations shall call me blessed for he
[1:47:59] that is mighty has done in to me great
[1:48:02] things and holy is his name and his
[1:48:05] mercy is on them that fear him from
[1:48:07] generation to generation and he hath
[1:48:09] showed strength with his arm he had
[1:48:11] scattered the proud on the imagination
[1:48:12] of their hearts he hath put down the
[1:48:14] mighty from their seats and exalted them
[1:48:16] of low degree he had filled the hungry
[1:48:18] with good things
[1:48:20] and the rich yet sent away empty he hath
[1:48:23] hope and his servant israel in
[1:48:25] remembrance of his mercy as he spake to
[1:48:27] our fathers to abraham and to his seed
[1:48:30] forever once she received the word of an
[1:48:33] angel that caused her to rejoice that
[1:48:35] caused her to have a new song that
[1:48:37] caused her to give glory and praise to
[1:48:39] god because she realized that the old
[1:48:41] testament prophecy was now going to be
[1:48:44] revealed through her
[1:48:47] how many scriptures and stories speak of
[1:48:49] a rapture
[1:48:51] but it's going to be revealed through
[1:48:53] you
[1:48:54] you will be you the people of the open
[1:48:56] book are the people of the rapture
[1:49:00] typed all the way to enoch 6 000 years
[1:49:03] ago
[1:49:05] about 4 000 you had a man of god
[1:49:08] on the earth that so pleased god with
[1:49:11] his faith god took him
[1:49:14] he was a representation of a multitude
[1:49:16] of people
[1:49:18] because remember mary had to believe
[1:49:20] something sister stephanie that has
[1:49:22] never been done before
[1:49:25] we're believing something that's never
[1:49:27] happened to a multitude of people before
[1:49:30] abraham was turned young but he went by
[1:49:31] the way of the grave elijah was
[1:49:33] translated but he was old
[1:49:36] we're going to be changed there's going
[1:49:38] to be the resurrection we're going to be
[1:49:40] changed and then we're literally going
[1:49:41] to ascend up
[1:49:43] and meet the lord in the air
[1:49:45] we're that people
[1:49:47] we're that people
[1:49:49] and it's never happened before
[1:49:51] but we believe it anyway
[1:49:53] it's never happened before it's easy to
[1:49:55] believe something after it's happened
[1:49:58] it's easy to believe in the man christ
[1:50:00] jesus
[1:50:01] 2000 years later for most people for a
[1:50:03] lot for multitudes of people
[1:50:05] but what about the jesus this message
[1:50:10] what about the god of this message
[1:50:14] that is him
[1:50:16] but whenever he came manifested we want
[1:50:18] moses we want his law we don't want
[1:50:20] nothing to do with you and they picked
[1:50:22] up stones to stone him
[1:50:24] when moses was the prophet of the hour
[1:50:26] they picked up stones to to kill moses
[1:50:29] it's easy to love and serve a god of
[1:50:31] history but the god of the present
[1:50:35] that's that's where the faith is
[1:50:37] that takes the grace of god
[1:50:40] let's read revelations 5 we begin to
[1:50:42] close
[1:50:44] and i saw on the right hand of him that
[1:50:45] sat
[1:50:46] in the right hand of him that sat on a
[1:50:48] throne a book written within and on the
[1:50:50] backside sealed with seven seals and a
[1:50:52] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:50:54] voice who is worthy
[1:50:56] to open the book and to loose the seals
[1:50:58] thereof
[1:50:59] and no man in heaven nor in earth
[1:51:01] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:51:03] the book neither to look there on and i
[1:51:05] wet much
[1:51:06] because no man was found worthy to open
[1:51:08] and to read the book neither to look
[1:51:10] thereon
[1:51:12] and one of the elders saith unto me
[1:51:14] weep not
[1:51:15] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:51:18] the root of david had prevailed to open
[1:51:20] the book
[1:51:21] and to loose the seven seals thereof
[1:51:24] do you realize that if god that jesus
[1:51:27] christ had not come and taken the book
[1:51:28] to open the seals we'd all be lost
[1:51:31] abraham isaac jacob they'd all be lost
[1:51:34] because they were all redeemed
[1:51:36] all their names are in this lame's book
[1:51:38] of life
[1:51:39] and it took a kinsmen redeemer no man
[1:51:43] was worthy
[1:51:44] whenever whenever whenever john looked
[1:51:49] whenever
[1:51:50] the eyes of god looked there was no man
[1:51:52] worthy
[1:51:54] to open the book
[1:51:55] he looked at elijah
[1:51:57] he looked at noah
[1:51:59] looked at moses they looked at enoch
[1:52:03] they looked at you they looked at me
[1:52:06] no man was worthy
[1:52:08] that is why john cried
[1:52:10] cried cried
[1:52:12] but then all of a sudden there came a
[1:52:14] voice that said weep not john
[1:52:17] we found one
[1:52:19] that was worthy
[1:52:21] not three
[1:52:25] one
[1:52:27] we found one that was worthy
[1:52:31] to open the book
[1:52:34] to loose the seals thereof
[1:52:36] so if he opened the book and he loosed
[1:52:38] the seal there had to be a prophet on
[1:52:40] the earth who the word of the lord comes
[1:52:42] to to receive that word and give it to
[1:52:44] the people
[1:52:45] because that is god's divine plan is
[1:52:48] that the word of the lord comes to a
[1:52:50] prophet
[1:52:52] so god's prophet had to be on the earth
[1:52:54] to receive
[1:52:55] the revelation of the word
[1:52:57] in verse six and i beheld and lo in the
[1:52:59] midst of the throne and of the four
[1:53:01] beasts and in the midst of the elder
[1:53:02] stood a lamb as it had been slain having
[1:53:05] seven horns and eyes which are the seven
[1:53:07] spirits of god sent forth until the
[1:53:08] earth and he came and took the book out
[1:53:10] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[1:53:12] the throne and when he had taken the
[1:53:14] book the four beasts and four and 20
[1:53:17] elders fell down before the lamb having
[1:53:19] every one of them harps and golden vials
[1:53:21] full of odors which are the prayer of
[1:53:22] the saints
[1:53:23] listen to this now this is the redeemed
[1:53:26] and they sung a new
[1:53:28] song
[1:53:30] not the song that was sung during even
[1:53:32] the church ages they sung a new song
[1:53:37] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[1:53:39] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[1:53:41] was slain and has redeemed us to god by
[1:53:44] thy blood
[1:53:45] out of every kindred in tongue and
[1:53:47] people and nation
[1:53:49] and has made us into our god kings and
[1:53:51] priests and we shall reign on the earth
[1:53:53] i find it very interesting
[1:53:58] that when brother ran preached salon
[1:53:59] shalom
[1:54:01] and he takes that prophecy out of isaiah
[1:54:03] and he said behold great darkness is
[1:54:04] upon the face of the earth but behold
[1:54:06] thy light has come
[1:54:08] remember that sermon
[1:54:10] and he talks about there being darkness
[1:54:11] in egypt but yet light and goshen all at
[1:54:14] the same time
[1:54:16] do you know that brother ram said that
[1:54:17] the most pitiful
[1:54:19] scripture in the entire bible and
[1:54:21] over you think about the resurrection
[1:54:23] i'm sorry you think about the
[1:54:24] crucifixion you think about
[1:54:26] how dreadful that was but yet he said
[1:54:28] the most dreadful scripture the most
[1:54:30] pitiful scripture in the entire bible is
[1:54:32] this lady of sin church age
[1:54:34] where christ is outside of his church
[1:54:37] knocking trying to get back in
[1:54:40] you say how is god outside of his own
[1:54:41] church they say i love jesus and they
[1:54:43] sing praises but they deny this is how
[1:54:46] he's outside of the church
[1:54:49] when they reject the word they reject
[1:54:52] him there's you cannot separate god from
[1:54:54] his word
[1:54:56] they rejected they said i love moses i
[1:54:58] love moses and they were they they were
[1:55:00] in there offering sacrifices old
[1:55:03] testament worship but yet the real lamb
[1:55:06] of god was on the cross dying
[1:55:10] they had rejected the word the
[1:55:12] denominational churches have done the
[1:55:14] same thing
[1:55:16] christ is outside so in the at the exact
[1:55:18] same time you've got the most pitiful
[1:55:21] scripture in the entire bible and you
[1:55:23] have the most sublime scripture in the
[1:55:24] entire bible which the prophet said was
[1:55:26] him coming to take the book
[1:55:28] at the same time
[1:55:29] we're rejoicing we're having a new song
[1:55:31] over the most sublime portion of
[1:55:33] scripture in the entire bible
[1:55:36] and the world is gripping
[1:55:39] with the most pitiful picture of the
[1:55:41] entire bible
[1:55:42] all at the same time
[1:55:46] all at the same time
[1:55:50] and i beheld and i heard the voice of
[1:55:52] many angels in revelations 5 11.
[1:55:54] round many angels round about the throne
[1:55:56] and the beasts and the elders and the
[1:55:57] number of them was 10 000 times ten
[1:56:00] thousand and thousands of thousands
[1:56:01] saying with a loud voice
[1:56:03] worthy is the lamb that was slain to
[1:56:05] receive power and riches and wisdom and
[1:56:07] strength and honor and glory and
[1:56:08] blessing in every creature
[1:56:11] which is in heaven and on the earth and
[1:56:13] under the earth and such as are in the
[1:56:14] sea and all that are in them hurt i sand
[1:56:17] john said
[1:56:20] all the creation heard john rejoice
[1:56:23] and people don't believe in rejoicing
[1:56:25] over the word
[1:56:27] could you imagine brother matthew
[1:56:28] whenever the wise men came
[1:56:31] looking for the king of the jews
[1:56:33] looking for that baby

[1:56:36] came to worship him
[1:56:38] when they came in jerusalem

[1:57:06] they stirred the whole city and they
[1:57:08] said what the whole jerusalem had no
[1:57:10] idea but yet you had three wise men come
[1:57:12] in want to know where jesus was where's
[1:57:14] the word made flesh where's the word
[1:57:15] that's manifested that's promised to be

[1:57:19] it i want to worship
[1:57:22] him nothing to be ashamed of
[1:57:28] whenever jesus came into jerusalem on
[1:57:30] that donkey
[1:57:32] and they were
[1:57:34] multitudes were spreading out their
[1:57:35] garments and they had their palms in
[1:57:36] their hands they're saying shouting
[1:57:39] hosanna cry the bible said and
[1:57:41] multitudes that went before and that
[1:57:42] followed christ saying hosanna to the
[1:57:45] son of david
[1:57:47] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[1:57:48] the lord hosanna to the highest
[1:57:52] i promise you it wasn't
[1:57:54] hosanna to the lord
[1:57:58] blessed is he that come with me

[1:58:14] wave that palm
[1:58:16] hosanna to the king in the highest
[1:58:18] hosanna to the son of david blessed is
[1:58:21] he that cometh in the name of the lord
[1:58:23] you're waving that palm in your hand
[1:58:25] glory to god
[1:58:27] you want to worship the lord
[1:58:30] now i'm not trying to get
[1:58:33] just an emotion out of you i want you to
[1:58:35] appreciate and to realize what god has
[1:58:37] done for us in this end time
[1:58:40] i want you and us to appreciate and have
[1:58:42] a and be to be sensitized to what god
[1:58:46] has done for us in this end time
[1:58:50] now i'm not going to read it because
[1:58:51] we're running out of time but if you'll
[1:58:52] put down in revelations 18
[1:58:55] and brother stephen you sung i thought
[1:58:57] it was wonderful you sung about this a
[1:58:59] couple weeks ago
[1:59:00] about the babylon the greatest fallen
[1:59:02] has fallen
[1:59:03] do you know the prophet of god said that
[1:59:05] that is actually the seventh church age
[1:59:07] messenger that's calling out the spirit
[1:59:09] of god through him that's calling out to
[1:59:11] the church to the elect of the age to
[1:59:13] come out of her my people and the
[1:59:15] prophet of god said that god was so
[1:59:17] pleased with what that prophet said
[1:59:20] that he echoed it in heaven
[1:59:23] you read it well you know what we'll
[1:59:25] read it right now amen real fast
[1:59:27] revelation 18 and after these things i
[1:59:29] saw another angel come down from heaven
[1:59:31] having great power and the earth was
[1:59:33] enlightened with his glory and he cried
[1:59:35] mightily with a strong voice saying
[1:59:37] babylon the great has fallen has fallen
[1:59:39] and has become the habitation of devils
[1:59:41] and the hold of every foul spirit in a
[1:59:43] cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[1:59:46] for all nations have drunk of the wine
[1:59:47] of the wrath of her fornication and the
[1:59:49] kings of the earth have committed
[1:59:50] fornication with her and the merchants
[1:59:52] of the earth are wax rich through the
[1:59:54] abundance of her delicacies and i heard
[1:59:56] another voice from heaven that's the
[1:59:58] voice of god saying come out of her my
[2:00:01] people that you be not partakers of our
[2:00:03] sins and that you receive not of our
[2:00:05] plagues god is repeating exactly
[2:00:08] confirming exactly that this seventh age
[2:00:11] messenger's message
[2:00:13] is exactly right
[2:00:15] it is exactly what god
[2:00:17] echoes from heaven this message is from
[2:00:20] heaven
[2:00:21] you just can't get away from it this
[2:00:22] message is from heaven
[2:00:26] [Music]
[2:00:30] brother braham said that god you come to
[2:00:32] a point and i'm not going to read for
[2:00:34] the sake of time but i've got a quote
[2:00:35] here that shows that god can you can god
[2:00:37] can be so pleased with you and what you
[2:00:40] say in inspiration that god will echo it
[2:00:43] that god will be pleased to bring your
[2:00:44] word to pass rather
[2:00:47] he will be pleased to honor your word
[2:00:49] was he pleased to honor sister had he
[2:00:51] writes word
[2:00:54] then he'll be he can be whenever you say
[2:00:55] it not not in our carnal minds not just
[2:00:57] because we we think of it but whenever
[2:01:00] inspiration really hits and there's
[2:01:02] testimonies whenever the inspiration the
[2:01:04] spirit of god really comes down and
[2:01:06] something is said and given
[2:01:09] wesley is getting ready to walk
[2:01:12] he is making constant improvements he's
[2:01:15] pulling himself up on his own now and
[2:01:17] he's actually even we didn't get a
[2:01:18] chance to get a video of it yet but he's
[2:01:19] actually walking along the furniture
[2:01:23] with purpose
[2:01:25] he's fast
[2:01:28] he's getting fast so
[2:01:30] we're getting our running shoes on
[2:01:34] we're getting our running shoes on amen
[2:01:36] praise the lord it will
[2:01:38] come to pass
[2:01:40] there's no doubt in our minds
[2:01:43] one last scripture and then we'll close
[2:01:46] in revelation 14
[2:01:49] verse 1 and i looked and lo
[2:01:51] a lamb stood on the mount zion and with
[2:01:54] him a hundred and forty and four
[2:01:55] thousand having his father's name
[2:01:57] written in their foreheads and i heard a
[2:01:59] voice from heaven as the voice of many
[2:02:01] waters and as the voice of a great
[2:02:02] thunder and i heard the voice of harpers
[2:02:05] harping with their hearts
[2:02:06] and they sung as it were
[2:02:09] a new song
[2:02:11] before the throne and before the four
[2:02:13] beasts and the elders and no man could
[2:02:16] learn that song
[2:02:18] but the hundred and forty four thousand
[2:02:20] which were redeemed from the earth
[2:02:22] this is where this entire sermon came
[2:02:24] from this single scripture
[2:02:26] when they sung a new song the bible said
[2:02:28] that no man could learn
[2:02:30] it
[2:02:32] but the 144 000 that's the jews
[2:02:35] whenever we get raptured up this same
[2:02:37] gospel is going to them
[2:02:39] and there's 144 000 of them and they've
[2:02:43] got their own
[2:02:45] and the bible said
[2:02:47] and no man can learn that song but the
[2:02:49] 144 thousand
[2:02:51] no man can learn the bride song but the
[2:02:53] bride
[2:02:55] why because you've experienced it
[2:02:58] you go through the experience sister
[2:03:01] charlene and then god gives you the
[2:03:04] victory song based on your experience
[2:03:07] that you just had
[2:03:10] you get the holy ghost and then god
[2:03:12] gives you a victory song
[2:03:16] and it don't have to be a song i'm not
[2:03:17] saying it's a song that you pinned down
[2:03:20] even though god can inspire you but it's
[2:03:22] a praise it's a worship it's an
[2:03:25] admiration it's an appreciation then you
[2:03:28] know he rose from the dead
[2:03:30] then you know you met the same pillar of
[2:03:32] fire that moses met you met the same
[2:03:34] pillar fire that abraham and isaac and
[2:03:36] jacob and enoch met you that adam the
[2:03:39] very one that came and put adam to sleep
[2:03:43] god came down himself
[2:03:45] god's
[2:03:46] jesus christ was the greatest man
[2:03:49] he was a man's man
[2:03:52] he knew
[2:03:53] when to turn the other cheek brother
[2:03:55] matthew
[2:03:56] he knew when to do that
[2:03:58] and he also knew when to start playing
[2:04:00] ropes and beating the money changers out
[2:04:02] of there
[2:04:03] he was a man
[2:04:05] so whenever
[2:04:07] adam and eve fell god's great
[2:04:09] masterpiece he came down himself
[2:04:12] he didn't send an angel
[2:04:14] he came down to do the work himself when
[2:04:16] he came to redeem us he didn't send an
[2:04:18] angel
[2:04:20] he came down himself
[2:04:25] that's my god
[2:04:27] i mean the musicians can come
[2:04:31] and if you would at sister cast if you
[2:04:32] start playing our god is tremendous
[2:04:35] i love this song this is a bride song
[2:04:37] right here
[2:04:38] this is a bribe song
[2:04:40] and i'm gonna as she's playing i'm gonna
[2:04:42] before we begin to sing it you can stand
[2:04:44] with me
[2:04:45] i like to read the lyrics
[2:04:47] because as i read the lyrics i want you
[2:04:50] to think in your own life
[2:04:54] that have you experienced
[2:04:57] this tremendous god
[2:04:59] that's what gets you so excited
[2:05:01] it's not just an emotional work some
[2:05:03] psychological emotional work up it's you
[2:05:06] take this word that is preached every
[2:05:08] service and then how you go out and live
[2:05:10] it
[2:05:11] that is what tells the difference that's
[2:05:12] the evidence of the holy ghost brother
[2:05:13] mark
[2:05:15] is when you believe this word but not
[2:05:17] just mentally believe it but when you so
[2:05:19] believe it you prove to the world you
[2:05:20] believe it by living it
[2:05:22] it becomes a part of you so as i read
[2:05:25] these lyrics let's think on them times
[2:05:27] when you were in need and you called on
[2:05:29] the lord
[2:05:31] brother david when you were in that
[2:05:32] accident you were in need of the lord
[2:05:36] and you called on him and so did the
[2:05:38] family so did the church and he came
[2:05:41] so whenever you sing that your mind can
[2:05:44] go back to that experience and say when
[2:05:47] i called on the lord he was there
[2:05:51] it says when i'm in need
[2:05:53] i call on the lord
[2:05:56] and he hears me yes he helps me
[2:06:00] he is faithful
[2:06:03] and true won't forget his own
[2:06:06] he's my companion remember he reveals
[2:06:08] more and more of himself to you
[2:06:10] he has proven to be your companion
[2:06:13] your best friend
[2:06:15] a bet a friend that sticketh closer than
[2:06:17] a brother the only true god
[2:06:20] there's no one greater
[2:06:23] a wonderful savior oh jesus the lion of

[2:06:35] sinner

[2:06:41] to guide me
[2:06:43] there's no storm too powerful
[2:06:45] our god cannot handle how many have had
[2:06:47] a storm you just couldn't handle
[2:06:49] you can identify with that you can then
[2:06:52] sing the song that we're about to sing
[2:06:54] and go back in your mind and you think i
[2:06:57] remember that storm i couldn't handle i
[2:06:58] had no idea how i was going to get
