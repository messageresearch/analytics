[39:22] to crumble
[39:23] [Music]
[39:26] and the cost
[39:30] be great i'll work
[39:35] for you
[39:39] that song has incredible significance to
[39:42] me as a young man
[39:45] many years ago it was during a song like
[39:48] that with brother homer singing
[39:50] that i surrendered my heart to to give
[39:53] myself to the ministry
[39:56] and because i sure fought it with
[39:58] everything that was within me
[40:00] i did not want to be a preacher and so
[40:03] i don't know if i'm a good one now or
[40:05] not but
[40:07] that song means a whole lot to me and so
[40:10] you may be seated just a moment
[40:17] we all are deeply grieved and our heart
[40:20] is broken in many ways and we have many
[40:22] emotions
[40:25] tonight with sister irene's passing this
[40:27] week and
[40:28] she's been a pillar of this church a
[40:30] matriarch of a family
[40:32] and quite a large family and
[40:36] been a real wife to sister to brother
[40:38] meadows
[40:39] and she's a real lady just a real
[40:42] lady she was a quiet lady but she had a
[40:45] lot of power in her
[40:47] you know you know as always as brother
[40:49] dan daisley preached it
[40:51] muhammad ali was the one that did all
[40:53] the fighting
[40:55] but his wife was more than a conqueror
[40:59] and so brother meadows has been has been
[41:02] a
[41:02] man of great strength and a lot of
[41:05] things that he's done
[41:07] but his wife is more than a conqueror
[41:10] we we want to send out our love to all
[41:13] of the family
[41:14] it's a big family it's a very extended
[41:16] family
[41:18] the funeral will be next next saturday
[41:21] at two o'clock here at at the elkton
[41:24] graveyard
[41:25] and it'll be a graveside funeral and um
[41:29] for larry it was a personal personal
[41:32] family
[41:33] thing but they're wanting to invite the
[41:35] church
[41:36] and of course we all have to have have
[41:39] our mask and
[41:40] do the social distancing but it's a
[41:43] great big graveyard so we can we can do
[41:45] that and so
[41:46] i would appreciate each and every one of
[41:48] you that could to attend that service
[41:50] and
[41:50] show the family their love and respect
[41:52] they sure would appreciate that
[41:54] and uh they're just a great family we
[41:57] love them with all of our hearts
[41:59] sometimes it just becomes our
[42:00] opportunity to show our love
[42:02] to them and so we know
[42:06] that satan lost the other day
[42:11] now you see she's only four months from
[42:13] being 90 years old
[42:15] but she stepped into a brand new body
[42:18] and all of these sermons that she has
[42:21] heard through the years
[42:22] came true
[42:26] they come true amen and so god
[42:31] raised her up you see no doubt the
[42:33] family was all gathered there expecting
[42:35] it
[42:35] at any moment things to happen jesus
[42:39] came into the room and touched and so
[42:43] you know jesus is coming you know so
[42:45] many times we think about the rapture
[42:47] coming
[42:47] jesus is coming but he's coming for one
[42:50] of us at a time
[42:52] he's coming for one of us at a time even
[42:54] now and so

[52:12] looking forward to those days and
[52:14] and uh so thankful for what we're seeing
[52:17] going
[52:18] on behind the scenes and and you know
[52:20] it's just like what happened here with
[52:22] adam and
[52:23] and carly i i can almost feel it in the
[52:25] water it's kind of
[52:28] it's going through the building so amen
[52:31] brother jim when you get done with the
[52:33] kitchen we'll probably be working on the
[52:35] nursery
[52:39] amen
[52:43] amen not joking
[52:47] amen amen if you will stand with me
[52:58] tonight
[53:05] this morning i was in prayer
[53:11] and in prayer the lord just turned me
[53:13] just literally turned me
[53:16] and here's the words that he spoke to me
[53:20] and so i quickly begin to dig and here
[53:22] we are
[53:23] and so if you this will be just as fresh
[53:26] to me as it is to you
[53:29] and as i announce my text i mean it more
[53:32] than just as announcement of a text
[53:35] god is greater than my problem
[53:42] now i want you to i want you in the next
[53:44] just few seconds to think about
[53:46] your worst problem worst problem go
[53:50] ahead and bring him the worst
[53:51] brother brahman said many of the of the
[53:54] cases of the of the prayer lines he said
[53:56] bring the worst one first sure he did
[54:00] sure he did worst case i want you i want
[54:04] to i want to just remind you
[54:07] no matter your worst problem
[54:10] god's greater can i remind you just for
[54:14] a moment before we read our text
[54:17] in creation out of
[54:20] nothing he spoke the universes
[54:24] into existence
[54:28] he spoke the word and believed his own
[54:31] word
[54:33] the red sea looked insurmountable
[54:38] but god was greater than a red sea
[54:42] there was a fire with three hebrew
[54:45] children
[54:46] stepping into it and god
[54:49] met them in the fire
[54:55] let me just say this to you when he gave
[54:58] himself
[54:59] as his own son the whole world was
[55:02] against him
[55:03] except for just a little group of people
[55:07] and every demon in hell wanted to see
[55:10] him destroyed
[55:12] but in giving up himself on
[55:15] calvary taking those stripes at pilot's
[55:18] judgment hall
[55:19] he defeated every disease
[55:25] and paid for every sin
[55:30] so god is greater than every cancer
[55:35] every paralytic condition every
[55:37] emotional
[55:38] problem that you've got he's greater
[55:41] than your debt
[55:42] he's greater than all your sorrow he's
[55:45] greater than
[55:46] every problem that you've got tonight
[55:52] hallelujah he's greater than covet
[55:59] he's great enough to change your body in
[56:02] the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[56:06] in a moment change your body to be a
[56:08] young man and a young woman again
[56:11] and then rapture you in the sky and not
[56:16] only do it for you but to do it
[56:18] universally around the world to a
[56:21] predestinated bride
[56:23] god's bigger than the gravitational
[56:27] force that holds us on this ground right
[56:29] now god's bigger than all of that
[56:32] hallelujah job chapter 38 and verse
[56:36] 1. i guess you could say that all of us
[56:39] in our pity parties have
[56:41] you know kind of whined a day or two in
[56:44] her life
[56:45] and if you've never whined a day or two
[56:47] in your life you probably really never
[56:49] had a problem
[56:53] then the lord answered job
[56:57] out of a whirlwind and said
[57:00] who is this that darkeneth counsel by
[57:03] words without knowledge
[57:05] girl up thou thy loins like a man for i
[57:08] will demand of thee and answer thee
[57:11] where was thou when i laid the
[57:13] foundations of the earth
[57:15] declare if thou has understanding
[57:19] and who hath laid the measures thereof
[57:21] if thou knowest or
[57:22] who has stretched out the line upon it
[57:26] where upon the foundations thereof
[57:28] fastened or who laid the cornerstone
[57:30] thereof
[57:33] when the morning stars sang together
[57:37] and all the sons of god shouted for joy
[57:43] amen why don't you say as we you are
[57:46] seated
[57:47] god's bigger than my problem
[57:50] you may be seated
[57:57] i don't know if you've ever met a person
[57:59] and i don't have a name to go with it
[58:01] right now but i don't know if you've
[58:02] ever met a person that you never asked
[58:04] them how they're doing
[58:09] because in the 30 minutes to an hour
[58:11] later
[58:13] they have gave you a report
[58:19] even maybe in their sympathy but toward
[58:21] your situation they always bring their
[58:23] situation in
[58:25] and their situation no doubt has been
[58:28] much worse than yours
[58:35] you understand what i'm saying
[58:39] and there's people that just relish or
[58:41] worship their problem
[58:45] worship their problem worship their
[58:47] disease
[58:48] let me just say this to you arthritis is
[58:50] not bigger than god
[58:54] cancer is not bigger than god
[59:01] we were in the we were in the initial
[59:03] stages of finding out that we had four
[59:06] stage four cancer brother nathaniel's
[59:08] been a nurse for many many years and he
[59:11] look he just
[59:12] leans down and whispers in my ear he
[59:14] said
[59:15] stage four is only a number
[59:20] it is nothing to be afraid of
[59:25] are you with me now listen without jesus
[59:28] christ
[59:30] it's a death wish
[59:33] but god said i'll go with you even in
[59:36] you to the end of the world
[59:38] he knew this before that we ever got
[59:41] here
[59:42] of what we would be going through but
[59:44] brother donny he has brought
[59:46] us through
[59:51] the prophet says he said one day when
[59:54] adam's race fell back there and was
[59:57] backed into a corner the law
[1:00:00] failed justice failed the prophets had
[1:00:02] failed
[1:00:03] the judges had failed and everything
[1:00:05] that god sent to the earth had failed
[1:00:08] and adam's race stood defeated
[1:00:11] weakness among them death among them
[1:00:14] everything the
[1:00:15] death horrors in every place nothing
[1:00:18] could be done
[1:00:20] but then in heaven
[1:00:23] there was one that stepped out the son
[1:00:26] of god and said
[1:00:27] this day i will give
[1:00:30] my life for adam's race
[1:00:36] what will you do cried the angels what
[1:00:38] will you do
[1:00:39] he came to the earth he looked upon a
[1:00:42] bunch of men and women that wanted to
[1:00:44] serve the lord and they couldn't
[1:00:46] there was so much temptation so much sin
[1:00:49] so much sickness so much troubles on
[1:00:52] every hand
[1:00:53] they couldn't everything had failed and
[1:00:56] he
[1:00:56] looked and he looked till he found the
[1:00:59] darkest spot
[1:01:00] of man's fear and that was death
[1:01:04] it's always been and he ran right to
[1:01:06] calvary and got the thickest of spears
[1:01:09] and
[1:01:09] throwed him into his heart and cried
[1:01:11] back said take what i
[1:01:13] leave you the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:16] and
[1:01:16] fight we're not a bunch of cowards
[1:01:22] we're not a bunch of whiners a bunch of
[1:01:24] crybabies
[1:01:26] we are warriors

[1:01:34] in like a flood
[1:01:36] the spirit of the lord it doesn't take
[1:01:39] god off
[1:01:40] off of off of a crisis god
[1:01:43] knows when the enemy comes like a flood
[1:01:46] he's got the answer
[1:01:50] the answer is not in the government
[1:01:53] it is not at barnes and nobles it's not
[1:01:56] in a book to try to figure out your
[1:01:59] problem
[1:01:59] he's got the answer when the enemy comes
[1:02:02] in like a flood
[1:02:03] the spirit of the lord shall lift up a
[1:02:05] standard
[1:02:06] against him we've got some words that we
[1:02:10] use around here

[1:06:37] sometimes it feels like that your
[1:06:39] prayers just go to the ceiling and then
[1:06:41] just fall back down
[1:06:44] feels like nobody hears your prayer
[1:06:47] feels like nothing's happening
[1:06:49] but whether you know it or not when the
[1:06:50] word went across your lips
[1:06:52] something happened because remember who
[1:06:56] you are
[1:06:58] you are a son and daughter of god
[1:07:01] never let the devil convince you any
[1:07:03] other way
[1:07:06] well brother ron the devil told me that
[1:07:08] that nobody loves me
[1:07:10] let me just say he's alive
[1:07:13] so that tells you you've got a lot of
[1:07:15] people that love you
[1:07:18] you got a lot of people that are
[1:07:19] standing with you you got a lot of
[1:07:22] people that's got their sword pulled
[1:07:24] with you
[1:07:25] and they're calling your name and
[1:07:27] calling and screaming out
[1:07:29] and hell would have done much worse but
[1:07:32] god's on your side
[1:07:34] how can you lose
[1:07:43] whether you're standing or you're
[1:07:44] kneeling whether you're in bed or
[1:07:46] whether you're driving down the road
[1:07:48] there is power in prayer
[1:07:53] you're not praying to a man to some pope
[1:07:56] some intercessor somewhere another
[1:07:58] you have a direct line being a son and
[1:08:00] daughter of god
[1:08:02] with jesus christ himself the creator of
[1:08:05] the universe
[1:08:08] that's got power to intercede on your
[1:08:11] situation
[1:08:13] don't go to somebody that don't have
[1:08:15] power to fix it
[1:08:16] go to somebody that's got it in his
[1:08:18] control that he can handle the situation
[1:08:22] that he can take care of it
[1:08:25] glory
[1:08:26] [Applause]
[1:08:33] moses prayed and egypt
[1:08:37] with their greatest soldiers the
[1:08:39] mightiest army in the whole world
[1:08:42] became fish food
[1:08:49] can you comprehend that just for a few
[1:08:51] minutes
[1:08:53] daniel prayed and lines laid down
[1:08:59] and he slept good all night long
[1:09:02] and later those same lines ate the
[1:09:05] people that put him in there
[1:09:11] elijah prayed and he outruned
[1:09:15] the fastest horses in all of israel
[1:09:20] 40 miles
[1:09:24] you talk about olympic runners
[1:09:28] he's a prophet old baldy
[1:09:33] but when he got in an atmosphere of
[1:09:35] prayer
[1:09:37] there was an anointing hit him and he
[1:09:40] got to running
[1:09:41] let me just tell you there's an
[1:09:43] anointing that super anointing that's
[1:09:44] going to hit this bride
[1:09:46] and she's going to take a step into
[1:09:48] another dimension
[1:09:51] there's nothing here that i want to stay
[1:09:53] here for
[1:09:57] i want you to always remember when god
[1:10:00] came down to talk to job
[1:10:02] about all of his problems
[1:10:05] he never mentioned none of them
[1:10:12] i love this god never even looked at his
[1:10:16] petty problems
[1:10:21] he never told him now job it's going to
[1:10:23] be okay
[1:10:24] your balls are going to get better he
[1:10:27] never told him
[1:10:29] you're going to be restored of
[1:10:30] everything
[1:10:32] he never told him that you're going to
[1:10:33] get back all of your cattle
[1:10:35] and your camels and i know you're really
[1:10:38] tore all the pieces about your children
[1:10:40] and you know you've got all kind of
[1:10:42] critics around you and he never
[1:10:44] consoled him on that he just asked him
[1:10:46] where was you at job
[1:10:49] when i laid the foundations of the earth
[1:10:52] when i created the
[1:10:54] the universe i'll tell you where you was
[1:10:56] job you was in my mind
[1:10:59] and you're as eternal as i am as eternal
[1:11:02] are you with me
[1:11:02] preach with me now it doesn't matter the
[1:11:06] size of your house or the name that's on
[1:11:08] your car
[1:11:09] or what your checking account says
[1:11:11] that's all just temporary stuff
[1:11:14] even your body is physically temporary
[1:11:17] material
[1:11:21] come on church i looked in the mirror
[1:11:23] the other day and my shoulders are
[1:11:25] stooping my muscles seem to be
[1:11:27] gone hair's doing what it's doing and i
[1:11:30] said lord
[1:11:31] i need a body change
[1:11:34] i really need a body change here he's
[1:11:37] got one
[1:11:38] for me
[1:11:43] first corinthians chapter 9 and verse 24
[1:11:46] that's enough about me let's preach
[1:11:47] about you
[1:11:48] he said know you not that they which run
[1:11:50] in the race run off
[1:11:52] but one receiveth the prize
[1:11:55] so run that you may obtain
[1:12:00] let me just say a lot of people started
[1:12:02] out with you but they ain't running no
[1:12:04] more
[1:12:06] a lot of people said i'm going to go all
[1:12:08] the way with jesus and they didn't get
[1:12:10] it past the corner
[1:12:12] a lot of people were committed for a
[1:12:14] couple of weeks a couple of months a
[1:12:16] couple of years a couple of decades
[1:12:18] and then all of a sudden something else
[1:12:20] came along
[1:12:21] i'm committed to the end
[1:12:26] it don't matter what it looks like i'm
[1:12:28] not looking at the circumstances
[1:12:31] quit quit worried about the bulls and
[1:12:33] quit worried about the animals quit
[1:12:36] worried about the family
[1:12:37] you and jesus
[1:12:42] and every man that strive before the
[1:12:43] master is tempering in all things
[1:12:45] he's in control and now that we they do
[1:12:48] it to
[1:12:48] to to obtain a corruptable crown but we
[1:12:51] are incorruptible
[1:12:53] i therefore so run not as uncertainly
[1:12:56] to fight so i not as one that beateth
[1:12:59] the air
[1:13:00] but i keep under my body and bring it
[1:13:03] into subjection
[1:13:04] lest that by any means when i have
[1:13:06] preached to others
[1:13:07] that i myself should be a
[1:13:11] castaway
[1:13:14] i don't want to waste my energies
[1:13:20] i'm not doing this for a show there's
[1:13:22] one thing that jesus liked
[1:13:24] if we can say this right he was not a
[1:13:27] showman
[1:13:28] so we're not a showman for anybody
[1:13:33] revelations 3 and verse 21 to him
[1:13:37] that overcometh i want you to put your
[1:13:40] name
[1:13:41] in that hymn and i want you to read it
[1:13:44] together with us tonight
[1:13:46] to ron spencer that overcometh
[1:13:52] maybe i'm not hearing good it's the
[1:13:54] medicine's affecting my hearing
[1:13:58] to ron spencer that overcometh
[1:14:01] will i grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:14:05] even as i also overcame and am set down
[1:14:09] with my father
[1:14:10] in his throne he that hath an ear
[1:14:14] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:14:15] the churches
[1:14:18] brother ron how do i overcome one day at
[1:14:21] a time
[1:14:22] one hour at a time one moment at a time
[1:14:25] how did shamgar whip 600 philistines
[1:14:30] one at a time
[1:14:35] one gave him faith for two two gave him
[1:14:38] faith for ten
[1:14:39] ten gave him faith faith for 50.
[1:14:43] the scripture said that they should have
[1:14:45] brought over a thousand
[1:14:46] but the devil is stupid
[1:14:50] and so he only brought 600 against one
[1:14:52] man
[1:14:54] how powerful is your prayer brother
[1:14:57] shannon
[1:14:59] when you utter a prayer the halls of
[1:15:02] washington
[1:15:04] do not have the power that your prayer
[1:15:08] has
[1:15:10] career politicians that that go around
[1:15:13] and find
[1:15:14] suits and do nothing but argue and
[1:15:16] bicker against one another
[1:15:18] and get nothing done
[1:15:23] they got nothing done kindergarteners
[1:15:26] could do more than most of them guys do
[1:15:29] but you've got more power
[1:15:33] than men than set in antiquated
[1:15:36] buildings
[1:15:38] with pop and splendor and all kind of
[1:15:40] discipline to them
[1:15:41] and they act like children but you have
[1:15:44] more
[1:15:45] power because your god is so real
[1:15:52] [Applause]
[1:16:00] well brother ron i feel like the weakest
[1:16:01] christian i got a quote for you
[1:16:05] he took him up on a mountain and set him
[1:16:07] down
[1:16:09] and he rebuked him again with the word
[1:16:11] and defeated satan with the word of god
[1:16:13] showing that the weakest christian
[1:16:18] can defeat satan with thus
[1:16:21] saith the lord it is written
[1:16:24] it is written it is written
[1:16:33] there is an answer in this book for
[1:16:35] every problem
[1:16:38] attach yourself to a scripture if it's
[1:16:41] if it's greater is he that is in me than
[1:16:43] he that's in the world
[1:16:44] and you keep quoting it brother branham
[1:16:47] said if you abided me and my words about
[1:16:49] in you ask what you will
[1:16:50] he said keep saying it until you believe
[1:16:53] it
[1:16:54] and then get up out of your bed and wow
[1:17:00] glory
[1:17:03] listen in july i thought i was coming to
[1:17:05] the end of my energy
[1:17:07] and i thought i was coming to the end of
[1:17:09] my energy and i thought i
[1:17:10] i don't know how much more that can take

[1:23:49] and my fortress and my god in him will i
[1:23:51] trust
[1:23:54] i caught that just now i said brother
[1:23:56] ron you use that scripture that's just a
[1:23:58] fallback scripture
[1:24:00] john mccain when he was a prisoner of
[1:24:02] war
[1:24:05] those men begin to teach him the only
[1:24:07] thing that will keep you sane
[1:24:09] is you get the scripture in your mind
[1:24:12] and you quote it over and over and over
[1:24:14] and over and over again
[1:24:16] there's nobody here that can help you
[1:24:18] but these words can help you
[1:24:21] and he learned the entire bible while he
[1:24:23] was in that room
[1:24:24] in that dungeon wherever he was at being
[1:24:28] treated incredibly cruelty
[1:24:30] don't tell me god can't take care of his
[1:24:32] word
[1:24:39] hallelujah surely he shall deliver thee
[1:24:43] from the snare of the fallon from the
[1:24:45] noise and pestilence
[1:24:46] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[1:24:48] and under his wings thou shalt trust
[1:24:50] his truth shall be thy shield and
[1:24:52] buckler
[1:24:53] thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[1:24:55] by night nor the arrow that flieth by
[1:24:57] they thor the pestilence that walketh in
[1:24:59] darkness
[1:25:00] nor the destruction that wastes it that
[1:25:02] noon day a
[1:25:03] thousand shall fall at thy side and ten
[1:25:05] thousand at thy right hand
[1:25:07] but it shall not come nigh thee only
[1:25:09] with thine eyes shalt thou
[1:25:10] behold and be and behold the reward of
[1:25:13] the wicked
[1:25:14] because thou hast made the lord
[1:25:17] which is my refuge even the most high
[1:25:20] thy habitation
[1:25:22] there shall no evil befall thee neither
[1:25:24] shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling
[1:25:27] for he shall give his angels charge over
[1:25:30] thee
[1:25:31] to keep thee in all thy ways
[1:25:38] use parents with little children
[1:25:41] use that over your child every day
[1:25:44] for he shall give his angels charge over
[1:25:47] thee
[1:25:48] to keep thee in all thy ways we
[1:25:51] are the best protected people in the
[1:25:54] world
[1:26:03] somebody came to my house the other day
[1:26:05] and was doing some work
[1:26:07] they said they don't know what this god
[1:26:09] does here but he's got 16 cameras
[1:26:13] on his house well that's just not
[1:26:17] what the that's only what they can see
[1:26:20] i got angels dispatched all around that
[1:26:23] house
[1:26:28] now i've been overseas and they had guys
[1:26:31] with with m16s
[1:26:34] sitting beside of me to watch over to
[1:26:36] protect me
[1:26:37] from getting robbed but if you could see
[1:26:40] in another dimension tonight
[1:26:44] we would call this kind of what we call
[1:26:46] half and half services
[1:26:48] but in that other dimension they're
[1:26:50] allowed to come
[1:26:55] and there's thousands of angels that is
[1:26:57] watching this service
[1:27:00] because you're just before the rapture
[1:27:02] and they're screaming
[1:27:04] get it finished press on hang on
[1:27:08] overcome we're with you we're fighting
[1:27:11] your battles for you
[1:27:13] if you could just get a charge from us
[1:27:22] i'd say in that dimensions angels like
[1:27:24] michael gabriel wormwood
[1:27:26] they get the attention of satan
[1:27:30] but i say in this dimension there's been
[1:27:32] men like david
[1:27:33] shamgar moses that got satan's attention
[1:27:37] attention elijah jeremiah
[1:27:40] nahum they got satan's attention william
[1:27:43] branham got satan's attention
[1:27:48] and because we're dipped in the same all
[1:27:50] in the same anointing under the super
[1:27:52] anointing of this day
[1:27:54] we get satan's attention
[1:27:58] come on church i hate satan and he hates
[1:28:02] me
[1:28:04] somebody asked me that one day said

[1:28:10] eye listen we're the winner
[1:28:16] we're the winner it's going to take a
[1:28:18] stronger win
[1:28:19] than this to knock me down

[1:28:33] enemy or a slave to cancer
[1:28:37] i refuse to i refused it to make it god
[1:28:41] because my god's greater than that
[1:28:46] come on my god's greater than that
[1:28:57] fanny crosby
[1:29:02] to the outside senses she looked like a
[1:29:04] woman
[1:29:05] that was poor in a reputable situation
[1:29:10] horrendous as what you might say to the
[1:29:14] eyes
[1:29:15] and most people that were looking for
[1:29:18] potential
[1:29:19] knew that she was gifted beyond
[1:29:22] extraordinaire
[1:29:24] and she could have been a millionaire in
[1:29:26] those days but refused it
[1:29:30] she refused it

[1:30:11] but she kept coming to church
[1:30:16] there's people with good bodies good
[1:30:18] senses
[1:30:21] that choose to do other things with
[1:30:24] their life
[1:30:25] but this lady receives eternal life
[1:30:29] and phenomenal rewards

[1:33:08] it comes to the pressure on you
[1:33:11] as long as the rocks were being thrown
[1:33:13] at jesus the disciples didn't have no
[1:33:15] problem
[1:33:16] but just as soon as jesus was gone and
[1:33:18] they were his representatives
[1:33:20] then the rocks started flying in their
[1:33:22] direction ain't no running as a
[1:33:24] christian
[1:33:35] word got back to jim bowie's mama
[1:33:40] that he had died in the alamo
