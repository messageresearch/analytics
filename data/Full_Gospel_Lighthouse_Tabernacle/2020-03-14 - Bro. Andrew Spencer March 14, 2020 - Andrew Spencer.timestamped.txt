[16:05] gonna be a few things we do we're going
[16:06] to just you know we're trying to use a
[16:08] little common sense here during this
[16:10] time here that we're doing here so we're
[16:13] gonna take the offering and we're going
[16:16] on put the offering out here at the
[16:17] front and we're gonna ask you to go row
[16:19] by row and bring your offering down that
[16:21] way we ain't gonna pass it out through
[16:23] the audience just I mean it's trying to
[16:25] use some common sense here you know I
[16:27] know it worked we've been hearing this
[16:28] for 27 years it's not something new for
[16:31] us you know is washing hands for 20
[16:33] seconds you know and that's what we do
[16:36] at work you know so and then I use
[16:39] common sense when I'm out in the world I
[16:40] go to places there's people here that
[16:43] you know that that their immune system
[16:45] maybe not brother Samuel for instance
[16:47] they wanted him to stay home tonight but
[16:49] he wanted to be in a church so he stayed
[16:51] back there because he don't want to be
[16:53] mingling with people shaking her hands
[16:55] bunk so you know over the next few weeks
[16:57] this thing something that exists a few
[17:00] weeks do we get through these critical
[17:01] times maybe it's nothing maybe it is we
[17:03] don't know but we're going to use some
[17:04] common sense during this time so you
[17:06] know just fist ball people we don't need
[17:08] to shake their hands for this time being
[17:10] so we just we try to use the you know
[17:13] that's the biggest thing we don't want
[17:15] to panic it work they say stay calm wash
[17:17] your hands and don't panic that's what
[17:19] that's what we've been hearing it works
[17:20] I mean we use the same what if I go to
[17:23] Walmart for go to ace if I go to the
[17:25] dollar store to go to the food line I'm
[17:27] using the same same thing there you know
[17:29] I might be reaching up and grabbing the
[17:32] doorknob with one finger but now I'm
[17:34] just trying to use some common sense
[17:35] here you know I'm not I'm not scared I
[17:38] don't have a fear it's thinking I'm not
[17:41] losing sleep but but on the other hand
[17:43] I'm just trying to use a little bit of
[17:45] common sense here so as we take the
[17:47] offering up if we can just go row by row
[17:49] and bring it down and and that way maybe
[17:53] if you can't get down wave your hand
[17:56] hand it to a little kid they'll be more
[17:58] than glad to bring it down for you thank
[18:03] you sister Anna would you have a special
[18:06] song that she could sing and then after

[43:19] that's our pastor and I want to guard
[43:21] him with everything that's within me and
[43:23] because I don't want his shoes none too
[43:25] soon and so I believe God's got big
[43:29] things for brother ons ministry and I
[43:32] believe that all the things that we are
[43:34] seeing are just just a little bit on
[43:36] what we're seeing on the surface I
[43:38] believe as it was spoke over brother
[43:40] Justin that you're at the tip of the
[43:41] iceberg and I believe I believe that
[43:44] that we are watching a miracle inside
[43:47] miracles on top of miracles that are
[43:50] coming from this testimony and and I'm
[43:53] just thinking the Lord that we're a part
[43:54] of this
[43:56] and so just don't miss what's going on
[43:58] and don't miss what's taking place in
[44:00] front of you and this whole thing that
[44:03] is going on with the corona virus don't
[44:05] let that scare you to death there's
[44:07] something way worse than that out there
[44:09] and so you just don't be afraid of those
[44:12] things but you trust in Jesus and he'll
[44:14] get you through
[44:15] hand sanitizer totally paper soap and
[44:18] all those things you know the world's
[44:22] got those things but we got blood we got
[44:26] a blood that covers all of our sins all
[44:28] of our sicknesses and we're just
[44:30] thankful to have a God that cares for us
[44:33] and I believe in being smart as well
[44:37] amen is that okay of everybody I know
[44:40] it's I know it's our human habit to
[44:42] shake everybody's hands but you know fur

[46:49] eyesight Lord not just natural but a
[46:52] spiritual eyesight to see that you're

[47:02] my father the Lord may you dismissed her
[47:05] to us in every detail of our life father
[47:08] Lord we know that this world is in a
[47:11] chaotic condition just now the father of
[47:14] the world has been on fire as it were
[47:15] for quite some time father and here we
[47:18] are at the closing of time and the
[47:20] blending of eternity father and your
[47:22] children know exactly where they're

[47:41] captives free and Nord will be careful
[47:44] to serve you and give you glory and
[47:46] honor and praise in Jesus name Amen
[47:49] 1st Thessalonians 5 and 1 but of the
[47:54] times and the seasons brethren you have
[47:56] no need that I write unto you for
[47:59] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[48:01] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[48:03] night for when they shall say peace and
[48:07] safety when they say I'll say peace and
[48:10] firmness
[48:10] peace and certainty peace and security
[48:15] security from enemies security from
[48:18] dangerous securities from weapons jerm
[48:22] jerm weapons when they say those things
[48:26] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[48:28] as travail upon a woman with child and
[48:33] they shall not escape but ye brethren
[48:36] are not in darkness that that day should
[48:40] overtake you as a thief ye are all the
[48:43] children of light and the children of
[48:46] the day we are not of the night nor of
[48:49] darkness therefore let us not sleep as
[48:52] do others but let us watch and be sober
[48:54] for they that sleep sleep in the night
[48:56] and they that be drunken are drunken in
[48:59] the night but let us who are of the day
[49:02] be sober putting on the breastplate of
[49:05] faith and of love for a helmet the hope
[49:08] of salvation for God has not appointed
[49:11] us to wrath but to obtain salvation by
[49:14] our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us
[49:17] that whether we are whether we wake or
[49:20] sleep we should live together with him
[49:22] wherefore comfort yourselves together
[49:24] and edify one another even as he also do
[49:27] may God bless his word he may be seated
[49:30] in the presence of the Lord
[49:32] 1st Peter 5 and 7 tells us to cast all
[49:36] your care upon him for he careth for you
[49:40] he cares to you care verse 8 be sober be
[49:45] vigilant because
[49:47] our adversary the devil as a roaring
[49:48] lion walketh about seeking whom he may
[49:51] devour whom resist steadfast in the
[49:58] faith knowing that the same afflictions
[50:00] are accomplished in your brethren that
[50:03] are in the world I love what what Paul
[50:06] tells us here in 1st Thessalonians 5 and
[50:09] 9 that God had not appointed us to wrath
[50:11] that that God has not predetermined our
[50:14] path that we would be destroyed or
[50:16] experience wrath God's not destined us
[50:19] to go through go through tribulation but
[50:22] God has destined us to go through a
[50:24] rapture God has not destined us to be
[50:27] beaten he is not destined us to be
[50:29] scores he is destined us for a body
[50:31] change there have been those that went
[50:34] through the dark ages that went through
[50:35] persecution but the bride does not go
[50:37] through persecution but we know that
[50:39] these things that we are watching these
[50:41] things are to be but we know that we
[50:44] don't have to fear what we are facing in
[50:47] this fight we don't have to fear what
[50:49] the world is going through we don't have
[50:51] to fear because the bride knows exactly
[50:53] where she's living at she knows where
[50:55] she's standing at she knows what she's
[50:57] facing more or less she knows the gods
[51:00] on her side so she don't have to fear
[51:02] you see if God's on your side what do
[51:04] you have to fear in life you know a lot
[51:07] of times we get caught up in the chaos
[51:08] of humanity and get caught up with the
[51:11] media of the world but we don't have to
[51:13] fear what is being displayed in front of
[51:15] us but I only fear the one that can take
[51:18] away this life and that is not Satan
[51:21] Satan cannot touch one hair of my head
[51:23] until God gets permission of him but I
[51:26] fear the Lord but we know that that is
[51:29] the beginning of wisdom but we look here
[51:31] and we see that God's not appointed us
[51:33] or he's not destined us to go through
[51:35] wrath or or with all the professional
[51:38] ease of life and the de-stresses of life
[51:40] that's not where God wants us to be God
[51:43] does not want us living down in the
[51:45] valley he was just living in the spot
[51:47] that he put us that we would be in it's
[51:50] just like the children of Israel when
[51:51] they were going through when they were
[51:53] going through the wilderness
[51:54] now that's not the spot that God wanted
[51:56] them to be at but that's the spot of the
[51:58] journey that they had to go through and
[52:00] there's many times that if you don't go
[52:02] through these battles and you don't go
[52:04] through these things you don't
[52:05] appreciate the land once you get there
[52:08] but I'd say this tonight that God is
[52:11] such a God of contrasts that we can look
[52:13] and we can appreciate health because we
[52:15] win through sickness we can understand
[52:18] love because we've dealt with hatred we
[52:21] can understand the God of heaven because
[52:23] we've lived with the god of this evil
[52:25] age we've lived we in Satan seated when
[52:28] we've been under attack after attack
[52:30] time and time again but there's always
[52:33] been one focal point there's always been
[52:36] one thing that we can keep our eyes on
[52:37] then the world is changing the stock
[52:40] market's changing the clay they create
[52:43] the crisis of the world has changed it
[52:45] it'll be a new thing next year but God
[52:49] has not changed sicknesses have came but
[52:54] God didn't change kingdoms have came and
[52:57] they went away but God ain't change if
[53:00] there's one thing that we as the people
[53:02] of God should be looking to it's to none
[53:04] other than thus saith the Lord the
[53:09] further we go in this world and the
[53:10] further we step into these things it
[53:12] proves to me that this message is right
[53:15] the further we get into this battle the
[53:17] more it proves that this is none other
[53:19] than Jesus Christ that this is not
[53:22] another message but this is the message
[53:25] of this hour that will change our bodies
[53:29] the more we go through these things this
[53:32] message is proven and vindicated and
[53:34] alive when you'd hear a prophet telling
[53:36] us that that in the last days that there
[53:38] would be germ warfare and these things
[53:40] that we're facing but then you would
[53:43] hear the prophets say that's God lost
[53:44] control
[53:45] or is he allowing just another agency or
[53:49] is he permitting another agency to
[53:51] control it he said but the truth
[53:53] of this question is is that there's two
[53:56] opposing spirits that's in the world at
[53:58] the war today and one of them is God's
[54:01] Holy Spirit and the other one is the
[54:03] devil spirit that is working in
[54:05] deception and the Prophet said that the
[54:08] people of the earth are now making their
[54:10] choice these things that we are seeing
[54:13] these things that we are facing there's
[54:15] a people that's making a choice there's
[54:19] a people that are making a decision
[54:20] where they're gonna stand that are you
[54:24] with me tonight Church there's of people
[54:26] that's making a stand if a voice said
[54:28] let's stand there's a people that's
[54:31] getting behind that voice and said if
[54:32] you stand I stand
[54:35] we're behind him with everything that's
[54:39] within us
[54:40] [Applause]
[54:43] hallelujah these things were seen and
[54:47] Layana cm and make us lazy they wear us
[54:49] how they tear us apart but oh how it
[54:52] makes us long for a city whose builder
[54:55] and maker is God I tell you the more I
[54:58] see in this world the less I want to see
[55:01] in this world and the more I wanna see
[55:03] of that world
[55:04] hello sir my the more I see of Laodicea
[55:08] the more it makes me want to have a
[55:10] faith for a body change the more I see
[55:13] sickness come the more I see death club
[55:16] the more I see formal folk it makes me
[55:19] realize that takes me out of this body
[55:32] and it's going to be the message just
[55:34] meow
[55:35] this message has given you're fake for a
[55:38] body trade class that we feel when we
[55:42] have been given the greatest weapon
[55:44] we've been given prayer we've been given
[55:47] the lord we've been given a committal to
[55:49] God why should we fear when Satan
[55:53] couldn't stand against this message when
[55:55] the Prophet was here how much more can
[55:57] he stand against said he cannot overcome
[56:00] us people may come and go they may need
[56:05] me discombobulated in their thoughts in
[56:07] confusion and different things and but
[56:09] they say that God changed God ain't
[56:12] change the message they change people
[56:14] change but the bride a change it that's
[56:23] a bold statement brother Andrew you're
[56:25] absolutely right to unbelievers the
[56:30] elect of God will be standing with us
[56:32] save the Lord this day and a rapture
[56:35] morning and unbelievers will be standing
[56:38] on the sinking sands of men's theology
[56:41] on rapture morning we can be bold in
[56:45] what we believe here right now you're
[56:52] watching fear grab ahold of people's
[56:55] lives like never before
[56:57] I know I'm just a young buck but I ain't
[56:59] never seen fear like this grab ahold of
[57:01] people's life's when you got millions of
[57:03] people that are panicking they got
[57:05] millions of people that are running
[57:06] around trying to chase them trying to
[57:09] chase down all kinds of different things
[57:10] trying to prep and you need to prep
[57:12] because there's some stupid people out
[57:14] there you don't want to be the guy that
[57:17] stuff about things so you've got to
[57:21] prepare in that own sense but you're
[57:23] watching as gripping as this fear is
[57:25] gripping the nation what are these
[57:29] things because they turn down this
[57:32] message
[57:34] [Applause]
[57:37] [Music]
[57:43] this nation this nation turned down God
[57:47] this nation turned down this message
[57:49] that's why you see plates falling upon
[57:52] upon the nation because they turn down
[57:54] God but you see these things of
[57:59] pre-tribulation plates
[58:01] this is you're not in the tribulation
[58:03] Church God there's not been one time
[58:06] that God said that he would send you the
[58:08] bride through tribulation and some
[58:11] people they like to tell you that you
[58:12] got to go through this so that you can
[58:14] have rapture faith
[58:15] what type of God do you serve if that's
[58:17] the case where he's got to beat you into
[58:20] a rapture this God loves you this God
[58:23] wants to take care of you
[58:25] not with your elbow sickness Carlo these
[58:28] things are to be we're humans we're
[58:31] going to get sick but there's God still
[58:34] love us absolutely you're a human you're
[58:38] made of 16 elements you're going to get
[58:41] sick you get healing tonight you'll get
[58:43] sick tomorrow maybe down the road or
[58:45] whatnot but God still loves you some
[58:48] people like to say well hold on somebody
[58:50] must have really done a bad seeing or
[58:52] done something very awful in their life
[58:54] they get cursed with that God's not that
[58:57] kind of a God sick this came from Hell
[59:04] you don't need to be afraid of this
[59:06] Karuna pandemic let's spread itself
[59:10] across the nations across the world that
[59:13] doctors can't understand where it's
[59:15] coming from and what not what you need
[59:17] to be afraid of
[59:17] it's the pandemic of sin that there's
[59:20] only one cure for it
[59:23] I suck the horse in the corona vine has
[59:25] something worse in a flow there's a sin
[59:28] and it's a worst killer than any luck
[59:30] disease any cancer in the Kelowna box
[59:35] since trying to kill you since I'm the
[59:38] Rob you you don't have to allow him to
[59:43] come in and rob you prematurely you
[59:46] don't have to allow sin you can put a
[59:48] blood there and the blood will stops in
[59:51] rightness tracks how are you brother
[59:57] branham said he left off the pressure he
[59:59] said to tension he said this kitchen is
[1:00:01] building up and results it's doing
[1:00:04] something wrong and after now to play
[1:00:05] someone's rough they're acting out a
[1:00:07] place that's right he said it'll make
[1:00:08] the poor at blow away it'll make the
[1:00:11] middle class act that way it'll make the
[1:00:13] rich hack that way it'll make the wrong
[1:00:14] act that way
[1:00:15] it'll make them pretty good after that
[1:00:17] way it'll make a good after that way
[1:00:19] because it's tension it's steam built up
[1:00:22] and it's got to blow out somewhere see
[1:00:25] if you don't it'll just blow the ball or
[1:00:28] up you see you've got to let off that
[1:00:30] pressure you're at a spot tonight where
[1:00:33] you can let off the pressure you can
[1:00:36] relax in the promises of God you say
[1:00:41] well you see there's so much fear in the
[1:00:42] world right now a fear don't drive a
[1:00:44] believer faith drives a believer fear is
[1:00:48] the opposite of faith prophets said
[1:00:51] there's only two faculties that govern a
[1:00:53] human and one of them's faith which
[1:00:55] brings results and the other is fear
[1:00:57] which has no value in it all faith is of
[1:01:00] God and fears of the devil fear makes
[1:01:02] you weary and fear makes you wonder he
[1:01:05] said if I was going to die in the
[1:01:06] morning what good would it do me to get
[1:01:08] all screwed up about it what if I was
[1:01:10] going to die or what if I was going to
[1:01:12] be electrocuted in the morning and my
[1:01:14] life had to end tomorrow morning what
[1:01:16] good would that do me to worry about it
[1:01:19] well you say well what good would it do
[1:01:22] to have faith faith can sign my party
[1:01:26] sir there's value in faith
[1:01:28] don't be weary don't be scared don't be
[1:01:31] upset just have faith and believe and
[1:01:33] the only way that you can have faith you
[1:01:36] have to love first for love produces
[1:01:38] faith for perfect love perfect love
[1:01:40] casts out fear God is not given us the
[1:01:45] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[1:01:48] and a Salma ha if God's going to give
[1:01:51] you something he's not going to give you
[1:01:52] fear he's gonna give you faith for the
[1:01:55] promise power to watch it come to pass
[1:01:57] love and a sound mind I was dealing with
[1:02:00] an individual one time and they told me
[1:02:03] that they were going through such a
[1:02:04] chaotic time of depression and anxiety
[1:02:06] and all these things he said and I went
[1:02:09] to a spot and here I was I knew I was
[1:02:11] born again I knew I was I knew I was a
[1:02:14] son of God but yet that enemy was so
[1:02:16] gripping my life that it wanted to
[1:02:19] strangle me and take my life itself he
[1:02:22] said but one night he said I fell across
[1:02:25] this scripture and second Timothy 1 and
[1:02:27] 7 that God has not given us a spirit of
[1:02:29] fear but of power and of love and a
[1:02:31] sound mind he said I look Satan in the
[1:02:34] eye and said this is where the battle
[1:02:36] begins you see if you can realize where
[1:02:40] that's coming from you can address and
[1:02:42] send it back to it come on somebody you
[1:02:47] know if you be given power you know what
[1:02:50] their act comes from you know if you've
[1:02:51] been given love you know where that
[1:02:53] comes from if you've been given a cell
[1:02:55] model a I'll see it you know where that
[1:02:57] comes from
[1:02:58] [Applause]
[1:03:00] you know where the blessings of God are
[1:03:02] coming from it's because of God is with
[1:03:06] us you look at people they lost their
[1:03:11] compass they've lost their way
[1:03:16] they're running around scared for their
[1:03:18] life's getting in fights because of why
[1:03:20] you can boil it down to fear you can
[1:03:23] boil it down to a rejection of the Word
[1:03:25] of God you can boil it down that they
[1:03:27] lost their way and that now a people
[1:03:31] that used to walk with God now no longer
[1:03:33] walk with Him and an amnesia has set in
[1:03:36] and when you see people that are in a
[1:03:38] panic and a fear mode it shows you a
[1:03:41] lost people under temporary situations
[1:03:45] it shows you that they have no anchor to
[1:03:48] hold on to but I look out upon you and I
[1:03:52] don't sense fear here what's the
[1:03:55] difference between you and the rest of
[1:03:57] the population of the community it's
[1:04:00] because you have an anchor
[1:04:04] so what if you get diagnosed with a girl
[1:04:07] of eyes so what if it comes so what does
[1:04:10] he get diagnosed with cancer or the flu
[1:04:12] or whatnot
[1:04:13] lots bigger than all events he's bigger
[1:04:18] than skin he's bigger than your Melton
[1:04:20] he's bigger than your circumstances
[1:04:22] we're not asking for the same but I
[1:04:25] don't less like God that still heals
[1:04:28] [Applause]
[1:04:34] he watched people as amnesia sets in
[1:04:37] you can watch the people that work so
[1:04:39] that once walked in faith and all of a
[1:04:42] sudden because of pandemic and I'm not
[1:04:45] just talking about what you're seeing
[1:04:46] here but I'm talking about sin I'm
[1:04:49] talking about this pandemic when all of
[1:04:51] a sudden it seems like it's gripping in
[1:04:53] on them and Satan's got a tow coat on
[1:04:55] them they forget where they came from
[1:04:57] they forget that first love they forgot
[1:05:01] what God delivered to them in this hour
[1:05:05] you see if fear can come in it'll grab a
[1:05:08] hold of your life and it'll make you
[1:05:10] forget the promises of God if fear can
[1:05:13] grab a hold of your life it will destroy
[1:05:16] every ounce of faith that you've got
[1:05:19] that's why you as an individual have got
[1:05:24] to stay in his presence when the rest of
[1:05:27] the world doesn't have an anchor you
[1:05:28] have an anchor when the rest of the
[1:05:30] world is in fear you're in faith why
[1:05:33] because there is an anchor in the blood
[1:05:35] of Jesus vows there is an anchor in that
[1:05:38] blood that is upon the doorpost of your
[1:05:40] heart and when that blood is there sin
[1:05:43] can't get in there when that blood is
[1:05:46] there Satan can't get past that blood he
[1:05:49] may try to make you fear that it ain't
[1:05:51] fair but as long as that blood is there
[1:05:54] Satan can't come close to it
[1:05:57] you see because you as a people of God
[1:06:00] are fortified behind the word there's no
[1:06:03] greater place to be standing in and but
[1:06:05] behind the Word of God in this hour
[1:06:07] you're behind that boy when you look
[1:06:10] over in Exodus chapter 12 when Moses
[1:06:13] told them to kill the lamb that there
[1:06:16] had to be a spotless lamb a perfect lamb
[1:06:18] he'd had to be just and pure they had
[1:06:21] you had to take that lamb kill that lamb
[1:06:23] they had to be identified with that lamb
[1:06:25] they had to take the blood of that lamb
[1:06:28] and put it over the doorpost and some
[1:06:32] people that was afraid to put it out
[1:06:33] there because that would identify there
[1:06:35] with with that with that chaotic man by
[1:06:39] the name of Moses they said that God
[1:06:42] sent them to deliver deliver them from
[1:06:46] each of deliver them from Pharaoh and
[1:06:49] some people were afraid to apply the
[1:06:50] blood of Jesus even today they're afraid
[1:06:53] that it will identify their life with
[1:06:56] the Christendom of this world but I say
[1:06:59] this to you Turks that if the blotting
[1:07:01] on your door and it's not the chemical
[1:07:05] of the blood but it's not for the blood
[1:07:07] if the Holy Ghost stay on your soul
[1:07:09] unwraps our morning you will still be
[1:07:12] left here you don't have to say that way
[1:07:17] hallelujah you can look at it there
[1:07:23] under the broad the households under the
[1:07:26] blood and Moses would tell them that all
[1:07:29] of Israel and all of Egypt that the
[1:07:31] death things will pass through this land
[1:07:33] a night he's going to pass through this
[1:07:36] land a night and where the blood ain't
[1:07:39] he will come in and smite the firstborn
[1:07:42] you can imagine as all the children are
[1:07:46] there in the house and there's they're
[1:07:49] playing with their toys and all of a
[1:07:50] sudden there comes a screen throughout
[1:07:52] the city
[1:07:54] they drop their toys and they run over
[1:07:57] to the window and they see that black
[1:07:59] wind has that death angel is passing
[1:08:02] through the city and then look out
[1:08:04] across the door they looked through the
[1:08:06] window and they see a house hope that
[1:08:08] they once played in over there and the
[1:08:10] blood and on that note and the death
[1:08:13] angel walks in there and takes the
[1:08:15] firstborn and it tries to come into this
[1:08:18] household but he can't come man and the
[1:08:21] son would say Papa what's going over why
[1:08:25] take that big black wing one coming this
[1:08:27] now he say son there's a blood there
[1:08:30] that's a blood barely can't get past it
[1:08:33] you see because there's a covenant
[1:08:36] between you and God
[1:08:38] you're my first bullet but the Death
[1:08:40] Angel cannot touch you because when he
[1:08:43] saw the blood the angel of the Lord said
[1:08:46] not this one
[1:08:47] Passover not this one Passover
[1:08:51] if wisdom hips hope and household not
[1:08:54] this one
[1:08:55] Passover Passover the Death Angel
[1:08:59] swinging through the land today a
[1:09:01] Laodicea and he has to pass over this
[1:09:04] life there's safety in this life expire
[1:09:09] in this life not this one Passover
[1:09:21] [Music]
[1:09:22] what a spot of safety what a spot
[1:09:26] security that death can't come knocking
[1:09:31] on your door because the angel says not
[1:09:33] this one that's over
[1:09:40] oh ha and if you know the blood say you
[1:09:44] can rest in those promises say can they
[1:09:47] whisper in your ear and he may tell you
[1:09:49] that you're going to die but you remain
[1:09:51] resting in those promises you can
[1:09:56] imagine as the tutor little sitting
[1:09:58] there you can imagine as the screams of
[1:10:01] the city are sounding out for the whole
[1:10:03] city
[1:10:04] and they're sitting there relaxed
[1:10:08] they're not fearing they're not tore up
[1:10:15] they're not tore up they're relaxing how
[1:10:19] are they relaxing because they know that
[1:10:23] there's a covenant between El Shaddai I
[1:10:27] and between his people what about you
[1:10:31] that was under the chemical of the blood
[1:10:34] of a lamb but you are under you are
[1:10:38] under the token you are under the blood
[1:10:41] of the Lamb you can rest in the promise
[1:10:45] first sin may come knocking on your door
[1:10:50] you said Passover sickness may come
[1:10:52] knocking on your door say Passover table
[1:10:56] all families it can come knocking on
[1:10:58] your door you said not today
[1:10:59] Passover either let fear fear is going
[1:11:06] to try to knock on your door say that my
[1:11:08] else is panicking you need a planning oh
[1:11:10] absolutely not
[1:11:11] Passover
[1:11:13] [Applause]
[1:11:20] the blood holds off death he supplied it
[1:11:24] does hello as a blood is greater than
[1:11:30] your sickness as the blood is greater
[1:11:32] than your sin there's no wonder working
[1:11:35] power in the blood of Jesus that'll keep
[1:11:38] you that'll wash you and the Prophet
[1:11:43] said that when a man or woman has ever
[1:11:44] been dipped in that blood of Jesus he
[1:11:47] said he kills all symptoms and every
[1:11:50] molecule sin and it goes back to the
[1:11:53] devil and laid on him to the day of
[1:11:55] judgment where his eternal destination
[1:11:57] will be thrown into a lake of fire
[1:12:00] that's the power of the blood of Jesus
[1:12:02] that when you confess your sins to him
[1:12:05] that when you confess her sins and place
[1:12:09] them under the blood of Jesus Christ he
[1:12:11] changes the molecular status and every
[1:12:14] fragment of your sin and he demolishes
[1:12:16] your sin but the chemistry of that sin
[1:12:20] goes back upon the head of Satan and
[1:12:22] lays on him till the day of judgment and
[1:12:25] you stand guiltless you stand UNAC
[1:12:29] usable you stand as the sinless spotless
[1:12:32] bride of Jesus Christ justified in his
[1:12:35] sight like you've never done it in the
[1:12:37] first place that's the blood that's
[1:12:40] covering you tonight
[1:12:42] and when the death angel passes through
[1:12:44] the land his same Passover Passover
[1:12:53] you can rest in that because about that
[1:12:57] boy there's an eternal atonement there
[1:13:00] and Satan is defeated never sickness is
[1:13:04] defeated suicides defeated depression is
[1:13:07] defeated cancer is defeated Jesus Christ
[1:13:11] shift him of all of his power at Calvary
[1:13:14] and he has announced to you as a people
[1:13:17] that he is with us he's amongst us and
[1:13:20] he's not leaving us Bible says in
[1:13:26] Colossians 3 and 3 for ye are dead and

[1:26:37] up but every single time I flip through
[1:26:39] the pages of the Bible I found him I
[1:26:41] find swear I find peace
[1:26:44] I find the Word of God that missed me
[1:26:46] and takes me high
[1:26:53] it's all the bible says in psalm 46 god
[1:27:02] is our refuge and strength a very
[1:27:04] present help in time in trouble
[1:27:07] therefore will we not fear will not be
[1:27:11] fear though the earth be removed and
[1:27:13] though the mountains be carried into the
[1:27:16] midst of the sea though the waters
[1:27:17] thereof roar and be troubled though the
[1:27:19] mountains shake with swelling thereon
[1:27:21] sell off there is a river the streams
[1:27:24] where else shall make glad the City of
[1:27:26] God in the Holy Place of the tabernacle
[1:27:27] of the Most High God is in the midst of
[1:27:32] her she shall not be moved
[1:27:36] God shall help her and that writerly
[1:27:40] the heathen rage the kingdoms were moved
[1:27:43] he uttered his voice in the earth milk
[1:27:45] the Lord of Hosts is with us the God of
[1:27:50] Jacob is our refuge so low breed that
[1:27:56] last verse the Lord of Hosts is with us
[1:28:08] now tell me what do I have to fear if
[1:28:12] God is for me if God is with me what do
[1:28:17] I have to fear you see fear reacts to
[1:28:23] what you see fear reacts to your
[1:28:27] feelings fear reacts to what what's
[1:28:30] being said about what's in your wallet
[1:28:31] fear reacts to those things because
[1:28:34] that's what fear sees but faith only
[1:28:37] reacts to the word faith and shook up
[1:28:41] faith a movement a thing here today and
[1:28:45] gone tomorrow faith is everlasting faith
[1:28:48] is the substance of things hoped for
[1:28:49] it's the evidence of things not seen
[1:28:52] maybe you may I can't see you may not
[1:29:00] see it but faith says it's there it
[1:29:04] depends on what you're looking with
[1:29:08] can you imagine Abraham walking through
[1:29:12] life telling his neighbors I'm going to
[1:29:15] have a baby 75 years old 76 years old
[1:29:18] all the way up I'd say that there were
[1:29:22] some days that he didn't see it with his
[1:29:25] eyes but the faith of father Abraham
[1:29:29] says maybe not today but tomorrow if it
[1:29:33] ain't right now it'll be in a moment
[1:29:35] father Abraham looked at the promise
[1:29:39] when everything around him the Prophet
[1:29:43] would say against all odds abraham
[1:29:47] believed against all odds now we ain't
[1:29:51] got nobody sitting here 200 years old
[1:29:53] tonight but here
[1:29:55] Abraham was and a hundred years old
[1:29:58] still believed in the promise yet some
[1:30:04] people think there's no way that I can't
[1:30:07] have faith for 25 years look at sister
[1:30:10] Esther just in this last day these are
[1:30:13] not of things of days gone by but right
[1:30:15] now some people can't understand while
[1:30:17] hoping on the faith that longer hold it
[1:30:19] out for the promise that long but you
[1:30:21] see unbelievers won't believe but the
[1:30:24] neighbors believe that it rocks that it
[1:30:26] was my life it was my life
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:28] [Applause]
[1:30:30] it ain't hard to believe a promise for a
[1:30:32] believer you just say have my word Lord
[1:30:37] I let down and faith brings it God
[1:30:43] promised it faith brings I love that
[1:30:47] faith has got its own delivery system
[1:30:49] it's better than UPS and it's better
[1:30:51] than FedEx but faith has got its own
[1:30:54] delivery system then if not and don't
[1:30:56] just bring you we don't bring you all
[1:30:58] kinds of chaos but faith brings you the
[1:30:59] promises that's amazing but fear wants
[1:31:04] to deliver to you a boxer rattlesnakes
[1:31:08] but faith says I'm not signing for that
[1:31:12] fear says you're not gonna get him to
[1:31:14] fix his hole yes I am I'm not resting in
[1:31:17] my own word and I'm not resting in the
[1:31:19] man's word but I'm resting in God's Word
[1:31:24] you see when fear is gone faith is
[1:31:26] perfect and overcome fear is to trust
[1:31:29] the word you can write that down to
[1:31:35] overcome fears to trust the word see
[1:31:38] that's what the devil wants you to do he
[1:31:40] wants you to get your mind on his talk
[1:31:42] he wants to get your mind on his
[1:31:44] language he wants you to get your mind
[1:31:47] off of God's word and he wants you to
[1:31:49] fear but to overcome fear is to trusting
[1:31:54] God's Word dad the devil wants to make
[1:31:58] you think that God don't care he wants
[1:31:59] to make you think that God don't see and
[1:32:01] that God has forgot all of his promises
[1:32:03] he wants to make you think that the days
[1:32:06] of miracles are past but there is a
[1:32:09] voice in this hour that God is with us
[1:32:11] and we will see miracles
[1:32:15] the devil is pointing you away from
[1:32:17] those things but God's putting your tool
[1:32:19] you see the devil is trying to tear you
[1:32:22] down by what you see with your eyes the
[1:32:29] God's trying to lift you up the things
[1:32:31] that you do not see he's trying to bring
[1:32:34] you to the things of eternal you see
[1:32:37] there are big people that are set here
[1:32:39] right now that a physical miracle could
[1:32:44] transpire in this service I believe a
[1:32:48] miracle could happen any moment we're
[1:32:50] gone I believe you're onboard of me
[1:32:53] tonight that that that we're if we want
[1:32:56] the supernatural to transpire that we've
[1:32:58] got to have the presence of the Lord and
[1:33:00] because without him these things are not
[1:33:03] possible but when is there a miracle
[1:33:06] content it could take place and there'll
[1:33:09] be people you you could say you could
[1:33:11] say an absolute physical miracle that
[1:33:13] you see with your own eyes you could see
[1:33:15] it transpire and transpire right in
[1:33:17] front of your eyes and you can forgive
[1:33:25] me for my the attrex but it's how it you
[1:33:28] you sit there and you'd see maybe maybe
[1:33:31] somebody come up here and had a tumor
[1:33:32] tumor on their chin or whatnot and all
[1:33:35] of a sudden you watch that thing fall
[1:33:36] off man that's God happy none other than
[1:33:41] God but there'd be people that in the
[1:33:44] morning that if they got diagnosed with
[1:33:47] something they would get home tore up
[1:33:50] and they will forget what they saw
[1:33:54] it's true it's biblical it's the people
[1:33:59] that walked the closer was swivel with
[1:34:01] Jesus they stood there with him when he
[1:34:04] was there and he was teaching all of the
[1:34:06] multitude and he's standing there and
[1:34:08] they said now we've got to send them
[1:34:09] back the disciple said we got to send
[1:34:11] them back there's no food here we've got
[1:34:13] nothing to give them
[1:34:14] they said well Jesus had one what do you
[1:34:17] got and there was a little boy that hit
[1:34:20] skip school the Prophet said now kids
[1:34:22] the only time I'm going to allow you to
[1:34:24] skip school is what Jesus is teaching
[1:34:27] then it's okay for you to skip school I
[1:34:30] know you're listening regular now and
[1:34:33] every other kid just now but here this
[1:34:35] little kid has skips goal to hear Jesus
[1:34:38] teach and they go out on the side they
[1:34:41] go out on the side of the hill and Jesus
[1:34:43] command to all the people to sit down
[1:34:45] and the disciples said now look this is
[1:34:48] all we've got we got a little schoolboy
[1:34:50] here and all of he's got all that he's
[1:34:52] got it's two fishes and five loaves of
[1:34:54] bread they smile ain't no way the
[1:34:58] Prophet said that that was barely enough
[1:35:01] to feed that little boy he said but once
[1:35:04] it was once surrendered into Jesus hands
[1:35:07] then he could bless it
[1:35:09] you see there's some things in your own
[1:35:12] life there's no way that you can make
[1:35:15] possible but one surrendering it into
[1:35:18] Jesus hands o taste and see what the
[1:35:22] Lord has done I'll magnify his name with
[1:35:25] me Jesus took these two fishes and five
[1:35:33] loaves some people say well the blood of
[1:35:37] the loaves of bread were a whole lot
[1:35:39] longer than
[1:35:42] all right the most smartest person in
[1:35:45] the whole wide world it would take a
[1:35:49] loaf besides of about three miles long
[1:35:53] to feed 5,000 people
[1:35:55] so rethink that statement but once it
[1:36:00] was in Jesus's hands when one basket
[1:36:05] would overflow it would flow into
[1:36:07] another and when they got done feeding
[1:36:10] all the 5,000 they took up twelve
[1:36:13] baskets full when you surrender anything
[1:36:17] in the Jesus's hands its magnified you
[1:36:23] may not be able to do nothing with your
[1:36:24] life but let God take it one time you
[1:36:29] may not be able to come see him but let
[1:36:31] God take it over one time they had just
[1:36:39] watched one of the greatest miracles
[1:36:43] that's told for over 2,000 years
[1:36:46] that science can't figure out right I'd
[1:36:50] say that they had one of them
[1:36:51] jaw-dropping moments what have we just
[1:36:56] watched they were watching the Messiah
[1:36:59] at work you can read it over in the book
[1:37:02] of Matthew chapter 14 you can read out
[1:37:04] how it transpires and you can read the
[1:37:07] dialogue of everything that is happening
[1:37:09] from verse 19 to verse 23 they have just
[1:37:14] watched one of the greatest miracles
[1:37:16] that's happened in front of their eyes
[1:37:17] and in verse 22 there's a gap and fear
[1:37:22] gets in this gap because Jesus goes up
[1:37:27] on a mountain to pray and his disciples
[1:37:31] get in a ship and all of a sudden the
[1:37:34] wind becomes boisterous and the sea gets
[1:37:37] all tossed about and they're all afraid
[1:37:42] and but Jesus was up on the mountain
[1:37:44] watching them the whole time
[1:37:46] and the Bible said that they cried for
[1:37:49] fear they cried for fear you see their
[1:37:54] fear was reacting to what they were
[1:37:57] seeing you see how easy it is for you to
[1:38:06] look at a miracle in front of you and
[1:38:08] all of a sudden fear gripped your life
[1:38:11] and you totally forget what just
[1:38:13] happened you think well they can't
[1:38:16] happen to me it happened to the closest
[1:38:19] people that walk with Him in human flesh
[1:38:23] fear grab their lives and they
[1:38:26] controlled them in a moment that if
[1:38:29] Jesus would not have stepped out on the
[1:38:31] scene they would have been destroyed but
[1:38:37] how can you destroy God's predestinated
[1:38:41] place you can't do it you see in that in
[1:38:45] that boat which disciples was preachers
[1:38:49] what's deacons West workers of the
[1:38:51] gospel and God could not allow them to
[1:38:55] be destroyed but fear came in there are
[1:39:00] times when you get so caught up in the
[1:39:03] things of life that you forget about
[1:39:06] what happened to brother on this
[1:39:08] ministry you have you forget what
[1:39:10] happened when he fell off a 40-foot
[1:39:12] ladder you forget what it's like you
[1:39:15] forget about when he was bit by a
[1:39:16] copperhead and every other ungodly thing
[1:39:19] that you can imagine happen to him
[1:39:20] but in the moment hate even say those
[1:39:27] words do not fear this cancer we had a
[1:39:32] prophet come and tell us in this hour
[1:39:34] do you fear cancer we've got no reason
[1:39:38] to fear cancer that's a god that's with
[1:39:41] us that's bigger than fear
[1:39:43] greater than cancer greater than any
[1:39:45] sickness don't forget it's a miracle
[1:39:51] working God is on his way
[1:39:55] [Applause]
[1:39:59] let the musicians come brother Brandon
[1:40:05] said in going away Jesus he said he said
[1:40:08] just like I said if Shakespeare was
[1:40:09] indeed I do the works of Shakespeare
[1:40:14] he said if Christ is in you you'll
[1:40:17] believe God's Word like he did he
[1:40:24] defeated the devil on every time he come
[1:40:26] and said it's written that's all and
[1:40:29] stood on it now watch this
[1:40:35] Satan note he believed that and he got
[1:40:39] away from him Satan know that Jesus
[1:40:46] believed what he had just spoken and he
[1:40:51] got away from him and the Prophet turns
[1:40:55] it says then call him call him to
[1:40:59] confirm his word making Hebrews 13:8
[1:41:03] right then the doubts and fear will
[1:41:05] cease just like the winds did them Oh
[1:41:08] winds going through your mind maybe I
[1:41:10] won't get it maybe it won't be me maybe
[1:41:13] he won't do this don't
[1:41:14] there ain't no maybe to it he promised
[1:41:17] it that takes all the maybes out of it
[1:41:22] Satan knew that Jesus believed this and
[1:41:26] Satan knows if you believe this you've
[1:41:30] got no reason to fear because Jesus is
[1:41:33] on his way you've got no reason to get
[1:41:36] tore up don't get caught up with what's
[1:41:39] going on around you don't becoming a
[1:41:42] prisoner to fear and let it enslave you
[1:41:45] and hold you bound let your faithful
[1:41:47] ooze
[1:41:49] God's with us the God of Jacob is our
[1:41:54] refuge if God is for us what do we have
[1:41:59] to fear in this day so if we've got no
[1:42:03] fear and that's what's dangerous about
[1:42:07] sons and daughters of God is when
[1:42:11] they're operating in that realm of faith
[1:42:13] and there's no fear there it gets real
[1:42:17] dangerous for the devil some of the
[1:42:22] human beings that I have been acquainted
[1:42:23] with in life have been operating in that
[1:42:26] realm of no fear in their humanistic
[1:42:28] standpoint they're not afraid of nothing
[1:42:31] you watch them how they act to watch
[1:42:34] them how they handle things
[1:42:36] you take granddaddy for instance no fear
[1:42:42] he just went forward and tore up Jack
[1:42:45] and fixed it later he was operating in a
[1:42:52] realm of no fear tell enough to get in a
[1:42:56] tree stand after he's done broke every
[1:42:58] vertebrae and tore his hip all up no
[1:43:02] feelings but what about when you get in
[1:43:05] that around as a son of God and there's
[1:43:09] no fear you go for him you tear up Jack
[1:43:12] and you ain't got what about fixing it
[1:43:14] later
[1:43:17] you what you do as a son of God you
[1:43:20] stare down bridges you burn bridges you
[1:43:22] tear up things these things are very
[1:43:25] they're my language I understand tearing
[1:43:29] up things it's what we do best as a
[1:43:31] church we tear up Satan's Kingdom and we
[1:43:35] have no fear endure
[1:43:48] unravel me
