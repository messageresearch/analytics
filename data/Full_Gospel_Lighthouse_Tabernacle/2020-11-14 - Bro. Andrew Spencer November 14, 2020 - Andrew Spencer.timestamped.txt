[1:43] listen
[1:43] did you know the bible predicts that in
[1:46] the last days
[1:48] that there'll be a germ warfare
[1:53] that diseases will break out upon the
[1:55] people and will fall on
[1:57] everyone without the baptism of the holy
[1:59] spirit
[2:00] but was the angel who had charged over
[2:03] these plagues
[2:04] was given orders to touch no one
[2:07] on whom the mark was how much kind of
[2:10] teachers have we got to be brother
[2:12] to get the church in order to be in that
[2:14] condition
[2:18] immune my arms are sore now from where
[2:22] the doctors just punched needles in
[2:24] to try to inoculate me from yellow fever
[2:28] and so forth
[2:29] i told them i didn't need it but they
[2:32] wouldn't listen to me
[2:34] but i'll tell you what god's going to do
[2:38] god's got a cereal and it's called
[2:42] the holy ghost and when that
[2:45] syrian goes in it'll inoculate you
[2:49] hallelujah in the last days
[2:53] i remember one time doing the 37 flood
[2:57] everybody had to take typhoid shots
[3:01] and so i was escaping mine i was aligned
[3:04] so i was out and gone some fellow walked
[3:07] up and he said
[3:09] have you got your shots yet i said oh
[3:10] yes
[3:12] i got my shot
[3:15] he said you did so did it make you sick
[3:19] i said oh no
[3:21] i said no i sure didn't
[3:23] [Music]
[3:24] he said when did you get your shop i
[3:27] said oh about three years ago
[3:30] three years he said well you ought to
[3:32] take another night i get one about every
[3:34] hour
[3:34] [Laughter]
[3:38] all right i was just going on to him
[3:42] but look friend the time is coming
[3:46] that when there is rising up a church
[3:49] if we can't have faith for divine
[3:51] healing how are we going to have faith
[3:52] for the rapture
[4:00] [Applause]
[4:05] if the flag is the flag happens to
[4:07] volume what we'll do we'll go get dr
[4:09] jones you know how to take care of it it
[4:12] didn't work
[4:14] yep they were smart what the flag falls
[4:17] we just go down beneath the ground in
[4:19] the
[4:19] cave and shut the door down i want to do
[4:22] one very good
[4:23] we'll stay in the house and put a mask
[4:25] over her face and
[4:26] and put some disinfect on it didn't do
[4:28] it again
[4:30] god made a provided way
[4:33] yes and it was what the blood
[4:38] god provided is simple as a scene to
[4:40] take the blood of the lamb and sprang
[4:41] the door
[4:42] yet god said that was his way and he
[4:44] honored it
[4:45] all out from our little blood died first
[4:57] one day the bible says that things will
[5:00] break out on this earth
[5:01] and diseases our people be calculated
[5:05] and so forth but the bible says don't
[5:08] you come near any of those who had the
[5:10] seal of god in there
[5:12] and the seal of god is that baptism
[5:17] [Applause]
[5:20] you see the oncoming
[5:23] and storms that still hit the earth and
[5:27] thunders and lightnings are going to
[5:29] shake the heavens
[5:31] woes are going to pass over the nation
[5:34] man will rot in their flesh
[5:37] diseases will strike them from doctors
[5:39] there's nothing about
[5:42] but remember before that took place
[5:45] there was the ceiling went
[5:46] forth and the
[5:49] death angels and the plagues was
[5:52] commissioned by god
[5:53] don't come near any of those he has a
[5:56] feeling

[6:02] the holy spirit

[41:52] gretna amen amen
[41:57] he's good to us sydney we have been on a
[42:01] journey for about a year
[42:03] and uh of course we've probably been on
[42:05] the journey a lot longer than that
[42:07] that the truth be no and unbeknownst to
[42:11] us
[42:12] but satan raised his head about this
[42:14] time last year and started to cause some
[42:16] situations to happen
[42:18] and it's brought us to a lot of
[42:19] different things we have
[42:22] been diagnosed with stage four cancer
[42:24] and i'm doing this more for people that
[42:26] are not here
[42:27] on the airwave than i am for you you
[42:29] know these things but
[42:30] we were diagnosed with stage four cancer
[42:32] within the first few months and
[42:34] and and of course it was it was in our
[42:37] lymph nodes
[42:38] and then in our lungs and uh there was
[42:41] just
[42:41] there was just big balls of cancer that
[42:44] was in our lungs
[42:46] and then then we would find out enough
[42:50] in a few weeks that we had brain cancer
[42:52] as well
[42:54] and so we we we have went and we've been
[42:57] diligent
[42:58] about every 12 weeks going to to the
[43:01] to the hos to the cancer center
[43:04] we have taken treatments two treatments
[43:06] a day
[43:07] all of this time and and
[43:10] and we have outlived all the projections
[43:13] that they said
[43:15] and we're just really thankful for that
[43:17] and we're just really thankful for that
[43:26] i want to share with you a scripture
[43:29] that says who hath believed our report
[43:33] and to whom this is the arm of the lord
[43:34] revealed
[43:36] for he shall grow up before him as a
[43:38] tender plant and a root out of dry
[43:40] ground and
[43:41] he hath no form nor calmlyness and when
[43:43] we shall see him
[43:44] there is no beauty that we should desire
[43:46] him
[43:47] he is despised and rejected a man a man
[43:49] of sorrows and acquainted with grief
[43:53] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[43:56] he was despised and
[43:57] and we esteemed him not surely he hath
[44:01] borne our griefs and carried our sorrows
[44:05] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[44:08] of god and afflicted
[44:10] but he was wounded for our
[44:12] transgressions
[44:14] and he was bruised for our iniquities
[44:16] and the chastisement of our peace was
[44:18] upon him
[44:20] and with his stripes we are
[44:23] healed
[44:25] [Applause]
[44:28] [Music]
[44:34] we would like to just just share this
[44:36] week we it was november the 11th
[44:39] and it was armistice day and and uh
[44:42] and so we we know that it's recognized
[44:45] and brother brown said that
[44:46] the world war was stopped by the angels
[44:50] that stopped that stopped that killing
[44:53] this this this week we went as we do
[44:56] every 12 weeks we get a
[44:59] uh i'll just tell you we get an mri of
[45:03] the brain
[45:04] we get a scan of our lungs and a scan of
[45:06] all of our
[45:07] all of our parts to our pelvis and so
[45:12] uh they will give us an update of of
[45:14] where we
[45:15] are and so i'm going to give you this
[45:18] update
[45:19] this is the best reports that we've got
[45:21] yet
[45:23] and we're thankful for that we we we
[45:26] celebrate the moment
[45:32] so basically what the what the uh
[45:35] maybe some of you've seen some of the
[45:38] report but the
[45:39] x-ray technician as they are done and
[45:42] they give their report
[45:43] they they could not find any of those
[45:46] nodules that are in the lungs
[45:48] only could you see some strands that
[45:50] were there and so
[45:52] that's a phenomenal report
[45:55] an absolutely phenomenal report
[45:59] and so and so we're just we're just so
[46:01] thankful for that they
[46:03] they found something in my kidneys but
[46:05] the god that took care of it in the
[46:07] lungs can take care of it in the kidneys
[46:09] they don't know what's there um
[46:12] shouldn't knowing that i actually went
[46:13] for tests yesterday
[46:15] and uh should know in the coming days
[46:17] but a god that can
[46:19] heal it in the lungs can heal it in the
[46:21] kidneys or heal it wherever it's at
[46:25] um we still have two we still have two
[46:29] tumors
[46:29] that are cancerous tumors in the brain
[46:32] and so
[46:34] do i fear it no sir none whatsoever
[46:38] and you see we will continue the battle
[46:42] and i wanted to just take a moment here
[46:44] we celebrate where we are
[46:47] because it's a great big deal to be
[46:49] where we are and
[46:50] and andrew admonished me said dad go
[46:53] tell the people let's have victory
[46:56] go tell the people let's have victory
[46:58] sound the victory alarm
[47:00] amen we just we appreciate what god's
[47:05] [Applause]
[47:08] doing
[47:17] [Music]
[47:19] to god be all the glory
[47:24] you said well brother ron but you still
[47:26] have cancer
[47:27] well let me just say this to you maybe
[47:30] shamgar was fighting and he had 600 men
[47:33] to fight
[47:35] and it seemed unfair because satan
[47:36] didn't bring a thousand
[47:42] he's a dumb deliverable he only sent 600
[47:45] against one man
[47:47] and he wasn't a warrior he just grabbed
[47:49] a stick and he went to work and
[47:51] somewhere around 200 or 300 he looked
[47:53] around and all those bodies was laying
[47:55] there
[47:56] i'm sure he began to feel good
[47:59] well this is kind of how where i feel at
[48:01] right now
[48:11] hallelujah and we believe a god that
[48:15] starts a work will finish a work
[48:18] and so we believe it with all of our
[48:20] hearts we will continue the treatments
[48:23] and uh however
[48:26] however long we have to do that we will
[48:28] do that for those that don't know we
[48:30] take
[48:31] immunotherapy by pill form and
[48:34] it is a it's a new qualified medicine
[48:37] that allowed me to be able to take that
[48:40] and respond i responded well to it and
[48:43] for those that don't think you ought to
[48:45] take medicine
[48:46] brother branham went to the best doctors
[48:48] in the world
[48:51] he went to the best doctors in the world
[48:52] went to mayo clinic
[48:54] and so and so he he didn't teach us
[48:57] nothing about not going to doctors and
[48:59] he said
[48:59] and if you go to the doctor he said you
[49:01] take the medicine
[49:03] and so and so i've been taking the
[49:05] medicine and and you know it makes me
[49:07] sick and
[49:08] you know we celebrate out here and
[49:10] there's times that we get sick and
[49:12] and it's it's some difficult days that
[49:14] we've had to deal with
[49:16] but we will press on the battle
[49:19] as long as it takes we're not quitting
[49:21] we're not
[49:22] giving up we're pressing forward in the
[49:25] name of the lord jesus christ
[49:28] so you know i'm sure david
[49:31] felt like having a dance when he saw
[49:34] goliath go down
[49:36] but the job wasn't done yet it was time
[49:38] he had to cut his head off
[49:41] so we will continue the work till we get
[49:43] his head cut off and so
[49:45] i certainly love you with all of my
[49:47] hearts and thank you for praying for me
[49:50] and we we we know that
[49:53] victory is ours and god's with us and
[49:59] and and the one that you know you're
[50:01] always happy when the doctors are happy
[50:06] and when when my doctor she just
[50:09] she just sit back on the counter the
[50:11] other day and she said
[50:12] you're a miracle she said every day you
[50:16] live is a miracle amen
[50:20] and so we're just uh we just are
[50:22] expressing
[50:23] we just want to continue to express that
[50:26] that every day is a miracle
[50:30] amen you say well brother ron i i went
[50:32] through some real difficult times

[58:24] predestination father that we know that
[58:26] you had ordained before the foundation
[58:28] of the world
[58:30] father we think about all the prayers
[58:32] that this full gospel lighthouse has
[58:34] prayed throughout the years
[58:36] but this past year father and to see
[58:39] that we're standing
[58:40] in the moments of those prayers coming
[58:42] to pass

[58:47] thank you for all that you have done for
[58:49] us we thank you for saving us we thank
[58:52] you for giving us
[58:53] our pastor father back from cancer
[58:56] we thank you lord jesus for the healing
[58:59] touch
[58:59] now lord we know that we've got much
[59:01] ground to cover
[59:03] and lord doctors see even tumors in in
[59:06] the brain that's
[59:06] there's nothing too hard for you lord
[59:09] even see
[59:10] either either blood clots or something
[59:12] else in the
[59:13] in the kidneys there's nothing too hard
[59:15] for you
[59:16] and lord there's cases that have been
[59:18] presented to you right here from this
[59:19] pulpit of prayer requests
[59:21] there's nothing too hard for you all it
[59:24] takes is one moment
[59:26] with el shaddai and father i believe
[59:29] that you're here tonight and you're
[59:31] visiting your people
[59:33] lord to to declare that there's there's
[59:36] no god like
[59:38] jehovah and i pray tonight that as you
[59:41] would begin to manifest yourself
[59:44] lord let your word ring out true into
[59:46] the ears of every
[59:48] human being that is sitting under the
[59:50] sound of our voice this evening
[59:52] lord we've not gathered here to be seen
[59:55] of man we've not gathered here to
[59:57] see one another we've gathered here to
[59:59] see you and hear from you
[1:00:01] and lord we we don't want to have a
[1:00:03] protractive meeting father
[1:00:05] lord we want to have a divine fellowship
[1:00:09] and a communion with you father
[1:00:11] we can say that jesus said across from
[1:00:14] the table and
[1:00:15] jesus began to speak to us and jesus
[1:00:18] discerned our hearts
[1:00:19] and jesus began to move into our address
[1:00:23] and know the secret things
[1:00:25] that only he would know about father we
[1:00:28] pray that you'd speak
[1:00:29] to us through your word today in jesus
[1:00:33] name
[1:00:34] amen amen if you have your bibles this
[1:00:37] evening we'll turn over in the book of
[1:00:39] deuteronomy chapter 27 and verse 9
[1:00:42] and then also chapter revelations
[1:00:44] chapter 3
[1:00:46] and verse 20. we certainly enjoyed
[1:00:48] having brother jason here last weekend
[1:00:51] and
[1:00:52] i believe that god ordained that and
[1:00:54] just supernatural events
[1:00:56] transpired and and some of you to ask
[1:00:59] you know he he stood from the pulpit and
[1:01:01] and asked and hoped that he would get a
[1:01:03] 12 point buck well he did get a buck
[1:01:06] and it was a half rack buck and it had
[1:01:08] two on one side and
[1:01:10] we're not really sure what the other
[1:01:11] side could have been so it could have
[1:01:12] been a 10
[1:01:13] 10 on that side we don't know but we do
[1:01:16] know that at least got the two points
[1:01:18] and so so we're thankful for for what
[1:01:20] lord has done and
[1:01:21] and so we just we'll just have to have
[1:01:24] him back to make sure he gets the other
[1:01:25] 2
[1:01:26] 10 points at some point so we just thank
[1:01:29] the lord for
[1:01:30] brother jason he means he means more to
[1:01:32] me than i could ever express to you he
[1:01:35] is
[1:01:35] he's one of my best friends in life and
[1:01:38] and just i i love him and his ministry
[1:01:41] and
[1:01:41] and he's just a real bosom buddy to us
[1:01:44] and
[1:01:45] certainly enjoyed that but we're looking
[1:01:46] forward to what god has in store for us
[1:01:48] this weekend and
[1:01:50] i'd like to speak to you by the help of
[1:01:51] the lord on on the voice
[1:01:53] on the voice of the lord deuteronomy
[1:01:56] chapter 27 and verse 9
[1:01:59] and moses and the priests the levites
[1:02:02] spake unto all israel
[1:02:04] saying take heed and hearken o israel
[1:02:07] this day
[1:02:08] thou art become the people of the lord
[1:02:11] thy god thou shalt therefore obey the
[1:02:14] voice of the lord thy god and do his
[1:02:17] commandments
[1:02:18] and his statutes which i command thee
[1:02:21] this day also revelations chapter 3 and
[1:02:24] verse 20.
[1:02:28] very familiar scripture to us here we
[1:02:31] see as jesus is speaking to the last
[1:02:33] church age of the closing of the book
[1:02:35] and
[1:02:36] and he says behold i stand at the door
[1:02:39] and knock and if any man
[1:02:41] hear my voice and open the door i will
[1:02:44] come into him
[1:02:45] and will sup with him and he with me now
[1:02:48] notice that that jesus is not speaking
[1:02:51] to an individual but he is speaking to a
[1:02:53] church
[1:02:54] and it is not an individual there where
[1:02:57] it's an open invitation or or
[1:02:59] that where where men would preach
[1:03:01] oftentimes that jesus here is knocking
[1:03:03] at the door of
[1:03:04] every every sinner trying to gain
[1:03:06] entrance but here jesus is speaking
[1:03:09] to the last church age and notice where
[1:03:12] jesus
[1:03:12] is jesus is on the outside of the church
[1:03:15] and he's supposed to be on the inside
[1:03:17] but jesus said that i behold i stand at
[1:03:20] the door and knock and if any man hear
[1:03:22] my voice and
[1:03:23] open the door i will come into him and
[1:03:25] will sup with him
[1:03:26] and he with me to him that overcometh
[1:03:29] will i grant to set with me in my throne
[1:03:32] even as i also overcame and am set down
[1:03:35] with my father
[1:03:36] in his throne and he that hath an ear
[1:03:39] let him hear
[1:03:39] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:03:43] may god bless his word you may be seated
[1:03:45] this evening
[1:03:46] amen uh in the
[1:03:50] philadelphian church age i believe the
[1:03:51] brothers have it for you this evening
[1:03:54] he said the last age will be a short one
[1:03:57] a quick work of consummation
[1:04:00] and not only is this so but one must
[1:04:03] always remember
[1:04:04] that in the eyes of god time is very so
[1:04:08] very fleeting
[1:04:09] yeah a thousand years or but a day and
[1:04:12] if he is coming within a few hours
[1:04:14] as he views time then he surely must
[1:04:17] warn
[1:04:18] us with all urgency and his voice
[1:04:21] must continually sound in our hearts to
[1:04:23] be ready against that coming oh there
[1:04:26] are so many voices in the world
[1:04:29] so many problems and needs crying for
[1:04:31] attention
[1:04:32] but there will never be a voice so
[1:04:34] important
[1:04:35] and so worth attending as the voice of
[1:04:38] the spirit
[1:04:40] so he that hath an ear to hear let him
[1:04:43] hear
[1:04:43] what the spirit saith to the churches
[1:04:47] and he that have an ear let him hear
[1:04:49] what
[1:04:50] he what the spirit saith to the church
[1:04:52] how many has an ear here this morning
[1:04:54] this evening
[1:04:55] so we realize that that through this
[1:04:58] hour and through this message and we
[1:04:59] understand that
[1:05:00] that throughout the chaos of life that
[1:05:02] the voice of god is a very rare thing
[1:05:05] today
[1:05:06] and many times people try to embellish
[1:05:08] or many times people try to say
[1:05:11] that the lord said this to me and really
[1:05:13] when god didn't really say
[1:05:14] anything to them but it begins to get so
[1:05:17] common that
[1:05:18] that people say well god gave me this
[1:05:20] dream or god gave me this
[1:05:22] revelation but the voice of god is such
[1:05:25] a very rare thing but
[1:05:27] but whenever god speaks you realize that
[1:05:29] when god is speaking he always backs it
[1:05:31] up with an amen
[1:05:33] but the reason why that the voice of god
[1:05:35] is such a rare thing today
[1:05:37] is because it's been smothered out by so
[1:05:40] many different voices of
[1:05:41] voices of politics and so many things
[1:05:44] that are there to
[1:05:45] to dim and take away uh take away
[1:05:49] from the take away from the voice of god
[1:05:52] and we realize that we're living in an
[1:05:54] hour that we're living in an hour where
[1:05:56] everything has a voice where where every
[1:05:59] person has a voice and
[1:06:01] every person has a platform you think
[1:06:03] about even
[1:06:04] 20 to 30 years ago man didn't have the
[1:06:06] platform that he had
[1:06:08] that he has in this day but every person
[1:06:11] has a voice in this day
[1:06:12] every person has a platform where they
[1:06:14] can put forth their agenda where they
[1:06:16] can
[1:06:17] there they can voice their ideas and
[1:06:19] whether it be
[1:06:20] facebook whether it be instagram whether
[1:06:22] it be messaging or wherever it is
[1:06:24] snapchat
[1:06:25] they have a platform in where that they
[1:06:28] can
[1:06:28] where they can voice their opinion and
[1:06:31] and voice
[1:06:32] their agendas and voice their thought
[1:06:34] and and you look at the world today
[1:06:36] and everybody's got their same agenda
[1:06:38] everybody's moving in one direction
[1:06:41] but i believe that today that the voice
[1:06:43] of god is directing a people
[1:06:46] in a different direction that every
[1:06:48] other voice is pointing
[1:06:50] pointing them you look at hollywood it's
[1:06:51] got a voice and it's sending people on a
[1:06:54] path to hell
[1:06:55] and many times when men is living in
[1:06:57] this hour
[1:06:58] they're listening to the chaos of life
[1:07:00] and they miss
[1:07:01] when god is speaking to them you see
[1:07:04] there's many of people that want god
[1:07:06] i believe that every person sitting here
[1:07:08] or listening this would say that they
[1:07:10] want god to speak to them is that right
[1:07:13] we want god to speak to us but many
[1:07:15] times we we've been
[1:07:16] we've got so much going on we've got to
[1:07:18] get little joey over here to baseball
[1:07:20] with
[1:07:20] susie over here to soccer and we gotta
[1:07:23] pick up the groceries gotta worry about
[1:07:24] a mask oh i forgot my mask gotta go to
[1:07:26] go back to the car and get a mask
[1:07:28] there's so many things that are there to
[1:07:30] distract us
[1:07:32] from the voice of god and when he's
[1:07:34] trying his best to speak to people
[1:07:37] they miss when god is speaking to them
[1:07:39] and they
[1:07:40] miss what is really happening to them
[1:07:42] but the voice of god
[1:07:44] is not a dead voice this evening it's a
[1:07:47] very
[1:07:47] alive voice and it's still speaking to
[1:07:50] people
[1:07:51] and turning the hearts of people you
[1:07:53] look at yourselves this evening you look
[1:07:56] at what just happened this evening or
[1:07:58] what you've just heard about
[1:08:00] that is due to the voice of god speaking
[1:08:03] things
[1:08:03] into existence and people of god
[1:08:06] believing what god has spoken
[1:08:08] and watching those things be made
[1:08:10] manifest
[1:08:12] right in front of them i'm not
[1:08:14] interested in hearing about fox news
[1:08:16] i'm not interested in hearing about cnn
[1:08:19] i'm not
[1:08:19] interested in religion i'm not
[1:08:21] interested in what man's got to say
[1:08:23] i'm not interested in science i'm not
[1:08:26] interested in politics
[1:08:28] i'm interested in one thing and that's
[1:08:30] the voice of god
[1:08:32] it's it'll be that voice that'll change
[1:08:35] this corrupt body
[1:08:36] it'll be that voice that'll put me in a
[1:08:38] body change
[1:08:39] it'll be that voice that gives me
[1:08:41] overcoming power
[1:08:43] i don't want to hear others speak i want
[1:08:46] to hear
[1:08:46] god speak
[1:08:50] now notice this now he said if others
[1:08:53] voices are contrary to the voice of god
[1:08:56] then it must be the voice of our enemy
[1:08:58] to confuse us
[1:09:00] that we would not understand the voice
[1:09:02] of god when it spoke
[1:09:05] brings great clarification to it it's
[1:09:07] that simple
[1:09:08] there's so many voices in the earth
[1:09:10] today that is absolutely a hard thing
[1:09:13] because it didn't the voice of the
[1:09:16] supernatural
[1:09:19] there is so many intellectual voices and
[1:09:22] great voices of mighty man who are
[1:09:24] intellectual that in their
[1:09:26] intellectual conditions even shake
[1:09:28] nations
[1:09:29] they are not just overnight people but
[1:09:32] they shake nations
[1:09:34] bringing great organizations together
[1:09:36] great campaigns flowery
[1:09:38] and a person would be a bit confused
[1:09:41] it's enough to confuse them of of how
[1:09:43] that these things go on and prosper
[1:09:46] and there's voices that raise up and do
[1:09:48] these things
[1:09:49] and it causes the voice of god to be
[1:09:52] placed
[1:09:52] way back somewhere the true voice of god
[1:09:56] and the voice of god they say how will
[1:09:58] we how will we know it's the voice of
[1:10:00] god
[1:10:01] because for today then it was in a
[1:10:02] vindicated prophet
[1:10:04] but now today how we know it's the voice
[1:10:06] of god are you listening
[1:10:08] how we know it's the voice of god it's
[1:10:10] because it's the manifestation
[1:10:13] of the prophet's word and this is god's
[1:10:16] prophet
[1:10:16] and a true voice of god only brings back
[1:10:21] that real living supernatural god
[1:10:24] i know you've seen it on the screen but
[1:10:26] i want you to catch this and i want you
[1:10:27] to see how evident this is
[1:10:29] only a true voice a true voice of god
[1:10:33] only it doesn't bring up everything else
[1:10:36] in the world
[1:10:37] it doesn't bring up chaos and all these
[1:10:40] other things
[1:10:40] but the true voice of god only brings
[1:10:43] back
[1:10:44] that real living supernatural god
[1:10:47] with his supernatural word with the
[1:10:49] supernatural manifestation of the true
[1:10:52] church
[1:10:52] or the true word then we know it's the
[1:10:55] voice of god you see if it's a true
[1:10:59] voice
[1:11:00] if if someone says well i'm going to
[1:11:02] this is what god has spoke to me
[1:11:04] and it doesn't come to pass it's pretty
[1:11:07] simple you know that god didn't say that
[1:11:10] is that right you remember when that
[1:11:11] woman came to brother branham and said
[1:11:13] the lord has made me a prophetess he
[1:11:15] gave me a great ministry
[1:11:16] and he told him about the lost dutchman
[1:11:18] mine and he said well that's just a
[1:11:20] legend out there
[1:11:21] she said well he told me to be on such
[1:11:23] and such date
[1:11:24] and fail and these things and to have
[1:11:26] these things in place say what do you
[1:11:27] think about that brother branham he said
[1:11:29] all i can tell you
[1:11:30] is be there on such and such day and see
[1:11:32] if it comes to pass
[1:11:34] well it never came to pass you seen
[1:11:36] which voice was speaking to them
[1:11:39] there's many of people that hear voices
[1:11:41] in their head today
[1:11:42] but there's only one voice that'll lead
[1:11:45] you right back to the word
[1:11:47] there's only one voice that'll make this
[1:11:50] live
[1:11:51] and if it's a true voice of god this
[1:11:54] voice will act
[1:11:55] it'll move it'll vindicate it'll be
[1:11:57] proven
[1:11:58] accurate just like when lazarus had died
[1:12:02] there was a lot of people that loved
[1:12:04] lazarus there's a lot of people that was
[1:12:06] concerned about lazarus
[1:12:08] even the disciples were concerned that
[1:12:10] jesus wasn't even moved
[1:12:12] when they came and told him that our
[1:12:14] brother is sick
[1:12:15] there was a lot of people that was
[1:12:17] concerned about lazarus
[1:12:19] there was a lot of people that would
[1:12:20] have wished lazarus back from the grave
[1:12:22] but only one voice had their power and
[1:12:26] the authority
[1:12:27] to raise lazarus up out of that grave
[1:12:30] here there sure mary and martha yes they
[1:12:33] would have loved to raise them up
[1:12:35] they knew they'd been walking through
[1:12:37] walking with and
[1:12:38] watching the ministry with but only he
[1:12:41] had the power
[1:12:42] and he had the authority to get a man
[1:12:44] that had been dead for four days
[1:12:47] nose done sunk in right in there in the
[1:12:49] grave
[1:12:50] even the sister said lord if you open
[1:12:52] that up thing now
[1:12:54] he's going to be staking in there it's
[1:12:56] going to be a stench come out of that
[1:12:57] place
[1:13:00] but jesus had such authority in his
[1:13:03] voice
[1:13:07] this was not just a man that was
[1:13:09] speaking
[1:13:11] this was more than a man but i want you
[1:13:14] to catch when you look over in john
[1:13:16] chapter 11 he told them
[1:13:20] to roll away the stone he told them
[1:13:23] you roll away the stone now jesus had
[1:13:26] all of the power in heaven and earth
[1:13:29] he had enough power that he could have
[1:13:30] spoke that rock and that stone right out
[1:13:33] of existence
[1:13:34] but brother branham said that hit was
[1:13:37] showing that you've got something to do
[1:13:40] i can stand here and i can preach i can
[1:13:43] get anointed i can even speak in tongues
[1:13:46] but until you move that stone out of
[1:13:48] your life the stone of unbelief
[1:13:50] the stone of circumstance the stone of
[1:13:53] life
[1:13:53] it won't ever do one good thing until
[1:13:56] you do something
[1:13:58] you got something to do in this service
[1:14:00] and only you know what you can do
[1:14:03] i know what i got to do but only you
[1:14:06] know what you can do
[1:14:07] and if you will move that stone out of
[1:14:09] your life you'll watch
[1:14:11] resurrection power come to a dead man
[1:14:15] hallelujah you'll watch as the authority
[1:14:18] of the lord
[1:14:19] begins to raise up life again
[1:14:24] and when jesus the bible said that jesus
[1:14:27] cried
[1:14:28] with a loud voice a man that had been
[1:14:32] dead
[1:14:32] four days in there rotten in their
[1:14:34] stinking he got up
[1:14:36] out of that grave but he didn't raise up
[1:14:38] there in that same condition that he
[1:14:40] went in he rose up a new
[1:14:42] man and that same voice is what's called
[1:14:45] you
[1:14:46] to this hour to this ministry to this
[1:14:48] time in which you're living
[1:14:49] you're not the old corrupt man that you
[1:14:51] used to be you're a new man in christ
[1:14:54] jesus
[1:14:55] you put off the former conversation and
[1:14:57] the lust thereof
[1:15:01] hallelujah hallelujah now look
[1:15:05] in the message look he says now god
[1:15:07] could have chose to preach
[1:15:10] the gospel by the sun by the moon by the
[1:15:13] stars by the wind or by nature but he
[1:15:15] chose men
[1:15:18] men to preach the gospel and that's
[1:15:21] where the voice of god will come
[1:15:24] from
[1:15:28] but he chose men to preach the gospel
[1:15:32] and that's where the voice of god will
[1:15:35] come from
[1:15:36] and you can judge the voice according to
[1:15:39] the word it expresses
[1:15:41] then you can see what kind of a voice
[1:15:43] that you're listening to
[1:15:44] if it's contrary to the word of god
[1:15:48] don't listen to it but
[1:15:51] if it is the word then god is duty bound
[1:15:54] to back that word up and vindicate it
[1:15:57] and make it truth because he's promised
[1:15:59] to do it
[1:16:00] so we're living in a great day these
[1:16:02] words of christ expressed
[1:16:04] and god has promised to us that he would
[1:16:07] meet the need of the
[1:16:08] hour and he always does
[1:16:12] is that right and what we need in this
[1:16:14] hour is the voice of god
[1:16:18] you can shut me down but you can never
[1:16:20] stop this voice
[1:16:23] are you with me i hate to break it to
[1:16:24] you i know it even breaks sister katy
[1:16:26] hart sometime
[1:16:27] but you realize that my literal voice
[1:16:31] is not the voice of god
[1:16:35] i know some of you were attached to this
[1:16:37] beautiful voice of mine
[1:16:40] just so connected to it it breaks your
[1:16:42] heart
[1:16:44] but my literal voice is not the voice of
[1:16:47] god
[1:16:48] because there's people in china people
[1:16:51] in zimbabwe
[1:16:52] that have never heard this whole country
[1:16:55] voice that talks twangy
[1:16:56] talks in all kinds of different stuff
[1:16:58] and sometimes i don't even understand
[1:17:00] what that thing's saying
[1:17:01] but my literal voice is not the voice of
[1:17:05] god
[1:17:07] and neither is william miriam branham's
[1:17:10] voice his literal voice
[1:17:12] the voice of god it was a
[1:17:15] instrument of humanity in which god
[1:17:18] showed forth his seventh angel's
[1:17:20] messenger his message came through that
[1:17:22] body
[1:17:24] i know it hurts your feelings i know it
[1:17:26] shakes you down to your core
[1:17:28] but the voice is not the william branham
[1:17:31] is not the voice of god
[1:17:33] only the voice of god is the voice of
[1:17:36] god
[1:17:38] you see if all you hear is my voice if
[1:17:41] all you see is me
[1:17:42] you have missed everything
[1:17:49] brother branham was a man brother
[1:17:51] brandon made mistakes
[1:17:53] i'm a man i know it i
[1:17:56] i know it hurts your feelings
[1:17:59] but i'm a man there's sometimes
[1:18:03] there's no way there's no way that
[1:18:06] god would say some of the things that
[1:18:09] come out of your mouths
[1:18:11] is that right oh my goodness
[1:18:15] 90 of us just accepted that we're human
[1:18:19] well done you did a great job
[1:18:22] well done i was waiting for it and you
[1:18:26] just
[1:18:26] whoo deep revelations are poured out
[1:18:30] but you know good you know good things
[1:18:33] there's some things that come out of
[1:18:34] your mouth and you're thinking
[1:18:38] did i do that
[1:18:41] but you know good and well there is
[1:18:43] times in your life
[1:18:45] that you know only god could have said
[1:18:47] that out of you
[1:18:49] come on somebody you know what i'm
[1:18:50] saying to you there's
[1:18:52] only he could say those things we've
[1:18:55] watched from this pulpit
[1:18:56] when the spirit of the lord would come
[1:18:59] down and move on top of a situation
[1:19:02] you knew that it was no longer ron
[1:19:04] spencer andrew spencer
[1:19:05] william borlavano matt spencer you knew
[1:19:09] it was the voice of god brother branham
[1:19:12] would say
[1:19:13] now i'm just your brother i'm just your
[1:19:16] brother
[1:19:17] but when the angel of the lord moves
[1:19:19] down then it becomes the voice of god
[1:19:23] oh hallelujah then i hear a prophet say
[1:19:25] your voice
[1:19:27] is his voice there is deity speaking on
[1:19:30] the inside of a body
[1:19:32] and there is resurrection power that
[1:19:35] will lift this
[1:19:36] body right out of here one of these days
[1:19:39] it won't be my voice
[1:19:40] it'll be his voice coming out
[1:19:43] [Applause]
[1:19:47] that voice had so much power in it that
[1:19:49] lazarus
[1:19:50] was way into another realm and he began
[1:19:52] to converse
[1:19:53] and he began to talk with abraham and he
[1:19:56] said the ones that you've seen abraham
[1:19:58] that you've seen when he was coming down
[1:20:00] that dusty road he said i was just with
[1:20:02] him
[1:20:04] and all of a sudden he began to tell
[1:20:06] joseph and he began to tell daniel
[1:20:08] all about him and then all of a sudden
[1:20:11] there came a voice that said
[1:20:13] lazarus come forth
[1:20:17] what was it it was a voice from another
[1:20:19] world
[1:20:20] calling him back into that world i have
[1:20:23] heard a voice from another world
[1:20:25] that's told me that this world is not my
[1:20:27] home and i'm just a passing through
[1:20:30] it'll be that voice that takes me from
[1:20:32] this realm
[1:20:33] into that realm
[1:20:38] hallelujah
[1:20:42] hallelujah
[1:20:45] jesus said john john chapter 10 and 27
[1:20:49] my sheep hear my voice
[1:20:53] and i know them and they follow me
[1:20:58] i know sometimes the voice can be a
[1:21:01] little tough on your five senses
[1:21:07] it can be tough on you five senses
[1:21:11] but i've never heard that voice ever
[1:21:13] heard hurt
[1:21:15] that sixth sense there's a lot of people
[1:21:19] that get offended by this voice
[1:21:21] but i choose to stick with this voice
[1:21:24] it may hurt my it may hurt my five
[1:21:27] senses of humanity
[1:21:28] but if the voice said that a woman's
[1:21:31] hair is her glory
[1:21:32] and it should not be cut i stick with
[1:21:34] the voice
[1:21:35] if the voice said in deuteronomy 22 and
[1:21:38] 5
[1:21:38] that a woman should not wear anything
[1:21:40] that pertains to a man
[1:21:42] i'll stick with the voice if it says we
[1:21:44] shouldn't paint up
[1:21:45] like a bunch of jezebels i stick with a
[1:21:47] voice if it says
[1:21:49] men should be men and women should be
[1:21:51] women i stick with a voice
[1:21:53] my sheep know my voice and they follow
[1:21:56] me
[1:21:57] if you can follow this voice through all
[1:21:59] of the pain and the hurt
[1:22:01] of these five senses it shows
[1:22:05] what you are
[1:22:08] some people think why in the world are
[1:22:10] you following that
[1:22:12] i'm just a sheep being led by my
[1:22:15] shepherd
[1:22:18] but a stranger they will not follow
[1:22:22] you can watch a howling come up and
[1:22:24] watch him try to turn your attention
[1:22:27] off in a different direction and you
[1:22:29] watch that sheep
[1:22:30] that sheep is accustomed to that
[1:22:32] shepherd she knows
[1:22:34] she knows where he's leading her and
[1:22:36] it's only the green pastures
[1:22:39] oh hallelujah it may be a rough road to
[1:22:42] get you
[1:22:43] there but you follow that shepherd he'll
[1:22:46] put you right in the body change
[1:22:48] you follow that shepherd through all of
[1:22:50] the word not half of it
[1:22:53] but all the way through
[1:22:54] [Applause]
[1:22:58] hallelujah
[1:23:01] it's only the voice of god that gets our
[1:23:04] attention
[1:23:06] just like when elijah was laid up in a
[1:23:08] cave
[1:23:10] a whirlwind came by and it didn't grab
[1:23:12] his attention
[1:23:13] the earth began to shake and it didn't
[1:23:15] grab his attention
[1:23:19] the thunderings the roarings they didn't
[1:23:22] grab his attention
[1:23:24] but when he came behind the steel small
[1:23:27] voice
[1:23:29] that's where god's at you watched last
[1:23:32] weekend
[1:23:34] when you watched that holy huss fall on
[1:23:35] this place
[1:23:37] only god could do that i know the
[1:23:40] backside of those things only god could
[1:23:42] do that
[1:23:43] that was not brother jackson that was
[1:23:46] god
[1:23:49] you see and then as you were aware that
[1:23:52] the angel the lord
[1:23:53] the pillar of fire was visible in this
[1:23:55] service
[1:23:57] he was very visible in the service i
[1:23:59] heard
[1:24:00] i heard a prophet say he said now when
[1:24:02] he appears
[1:24:04] he's got something to say
[1:24:07] hallelujah you take a look back at those
[1:24:09] words
[1:24:10] you take a look back at that sermon last
[1:24:12] weekend and you'll see that god had
[1:24:14] something to say
[1:24:16] hallelujah do you do you believe that
[1:24:19] he's here now
[1:24:21] do you believe that he's visible now
[1:24:23] he's got something to say
[1:24:28] now notice god never speaks a word
[1:24:30] unless he's got a reason for speaking
[1:24:31] that word
[1:24:32] he's not like you and i that we or
[1:24:34] especially myself
[1:24:35] that just speaks things so so many
[1:24:38] foolish things god speaks every word
[1:24:40] with a meaning
[1:24:41] and something that he is trying to
[1:24:43] achieve
[1:24:44] and will achieve by his word you see
[1:24:47] when god was going to use the earth
[1:24:49] and it was in complete and total
[1:24:51] darkness the spirit of god spoke out and
[1:24:54] said let there be light
[1:24:57] hallelujah and it was light
[1:25:00] because the voice spoke it and it
[1:25:04] manifested
[1:25:05] and as long as it went out of its mouth
[1:25:07] out of his mouth in a word
[1:25:09] it has to be manifested and you watch
[1:25:12] what happened when that when that word
[1:25:14] was spoken let there be light
[1:25:16] darkness begin to scatter that's what
[1:25:19] light does it's still doing the same
[1:25:20] exact thing today
[1:25:22] that light of the word is coming across
[1:25:24] your path and it's driving away the
[1:25:26] darkness of laodicea
[1:25:28] driving away and what is it it's his
[1:25:31] voice
[1:25:33] notice in psalms 29 and 3 the voice of
[1:25:36] the lord is upon the waters
[1:25:38] the god of glory thundereth the lord is
[1:25:40] upon many waters
[1:25:41] the voice of the lord is powerful the
[1:25:43] voice of the lord is full of majesty
[1:25:45] the voice of the lord breakthroughs yea
[1:25:48] the lord breaketh the cedars of lebanon
[1:25:50] he maketh also to skip like a calf in
[1:25:53] lebanon assyrian
[1:25:54] and like a young unicorn the voice of
[1:25:57] the lord divided the flames of fire
[1:25:59] the voice of the lord shaketh the
[1:26:00] wilderness the lord shaketh the
[1:26:02] wilderness of cadets
[1:26:04] the voice of the lord maketh the hinds
[1:26:06] the calf
[1:26:08] and discover his force and in the temple
[1:26:11] duff he
[1:26:12] does everyone speak of his glory
[1:26:17] you notice when jesus was walking with
[1:26:19] his disciples
[1:26:21] when they came a corner upon a tree that
[1:26:22] did not bear fruit
[1:26:24] that jesus began to curse that tree and
[1:26:26] that tree
[1:26:27] immediately withered at the voice of the
[1:26:29] lord jesus
[1:26:31] it showed that he was interested in all
[1:26:33] things he was interested in a small
[1:26:35] thing
[1:26:36] when this thing would not produce life
[1:26:38] in the presence of almighty life
[1:26:40] he cursed it and you look at somebody's
[1:26:44] life let me just preach this for a
[1:26:46] moment when you look at somebody's life
[1:26:48] and you see that they're standing right
[1:26:50] there you know when you're standing
[1:26:52] right in the presence of jehovah
[1:26:54] and they don't produce life you're
[1:26:56] looking upon something
[1:26:58] that has been cursed hallelujah
[1:27:02] but you can hear that same voice as they
[1:27:04] begin to restore
[1:27:05] life to lepers that were completely
[1:27:08] cleansed you watched that same voice
[1:27:10] as prostitutes were made clean you watch
[1:27:13] that same voice
[1:27:14] take dead life and bring it right back
[1:27:16] to life
[1:27:18] you watched that voice as he began to
[1:27:19] take bread in his hand and they began to
[1:27:21] bless that bread
[1:27:22] it became cooked bread and it fed 5 000.
[1:27:26] that voice has the power
[1:27:30] what's your situation what's your
[1:27:32] torment
[1:27:34] one moment with this voice with the god
[1:27:36] of this voice
[1:27:37] it'll change it'll change cancer
[1:27:40] it'll change tb it'll train sugar
[1:27:43] diabetes
[1:27:44] it'll change heart trouble it'll change
[1:27:46] kidney disease
[1:27:47] one moment in his presence oh just let
[1:27:50] him speak
[1:27:51] he spoke a world into existence surely
[1:27:54] he can change
[1:27:55] every every eye every cell in your body
[1:27:58] to make it obey his word
[1:28:04] i notice he says
[1:28:09] he said now now this microphone here
[1:28:12] it's a mute unless there's a voice here
[1:28:15] to go through it
[1:28:16] that's the way we are the church is the
[1:28:19] church
[1:28:20] is a complete mute unless it's subject
[1:28:24] to the spirit of god
[1:28:28] to let the spirit speak through the
[1:28:30] church as god will
[1:28:32] and then it becomes a voice to the world
[1:28:35] as long as it's an outlet the church is
[1:28:38] an outlet of the voice
[1:28:40] of the lord jesus to the peoples of the
[1:28:43] world
[1:28:47] you have that much power
[1:28:50] that the church is an outlet of the
[1:28:54] voice of the lord jesus
[1:28:55] to the peoples of the world noah was an
[1:28:58] outlet
[1:28:59] he was an outlet when nobody else would
[1:29:01] stand with him when there wasn't a cloud
[1:29:03] in the sky
[1:29:04] when there was when there was scientific
[1:29:06] proof that there was no rain up there
[1:29:09] no noah was an outlet to the dying
[1:29:11] generation
[1:29:12] that there was a guard that said it's
[1:29:15] going to rain
[1:29:16] he said that voice spoke to me it said
[1:29:19] noah
[1:29:19] it's going to rain and he told me that
[1:29:22] voice said
[1:29:23] go out and build a an ark and you're
[1:29:25] going to build this thing to such and
[1:29:27] such cubits
[1:29:28] and you're going to make it this big and
[1:29:29] you're going to make it out of
[1:29:30] impossible wood
[1:29:33] impossible but then i want you to pitch
[1:29:35] it with tar
[1:29:36] i want you to build it in such the
[1:29:37] dimensions and everything else
[1:29:40] it didn't make sense to nobody else but
[1:29:43] noah said
[1:29:44] i'm following a voice he was an outlet
[1:29:47] to a world
[1:29:48] that did not believe him and there was
[1:29:52] critics sitting there
[1:29:53] and said there's no way possible noah
[1:29:58] you're dreaming up some kind of crazy
[1:30:00] thing we've
[1:30:01] got we've got the technology to shoot
[1:30:04] rays or
[1:30:04] lasers up there and see there's nothing
[1:30:07] up there
[1:30:09] but in the face of the critics he stood
[1:30:12] there and said a voice spoke to me
[1:30:14] to do this and i'm going to do it
[1:30:17] i heard a voice that preaches sermon and
[1:30:19] you may be against me but i'm gonna
[1:30:21] preach this term
[1:30:23] i heard a voice that told me to get
[1:30:25] ready for a body change
[1:30:27] you may not want to sing with me but i'm
[1:30:29] going to sing to the way
[1:30:30] till the praises come down i heard a
[1:30:33] voice that built it this way
[1:30:35] and i'm going to build a church this way
[1:30:37] according to the gospel
[1:30:39] every critic in hell might be against me
[1:30:41] brother nathanael
[1:30:42] but as for me and my house i'll follow
[1:30:45] this voice
[1:30:47] when nobody else wants to walk with me
[1:30:49] when everybody else wants to go away
[1:30:51] i will follow this voice to the ends of
[1:30:53] the world
[1:30:56] he's made some supernatural promises and
[1:30:59] i am just supernatural enough
[1:31:01] to believe them
[1:31:06] you say it's going to take a whole lot
[1:31:07] of faith to believe what this bible says
[1:31:09] that's exactly what it's going to take
[1:31:16] hallelujah
[1:31:20] god sees behind closed doors
[1:31:25] he knows all things
[1:31:28] he sees all things he's saying he knows
[1:31:30] what you say
[1:31:31] behind your door i believe that there's
[1:31:35] a god
[1:31:36] god of elijah still here that knows the
[1:31:40] secrets
[1:31:41] in that ahab's tent i believe there's a
[1:31:44] god still here that can read
[1:31:46] and discern the thoughts and the intents
[1:31:47] of the heart and when you try to muzzle
[1:31:50] the ox
[1:31:51] that tread is left what are you doing
[1:31:53] you're stopping the voice of god
[1:31:55] and when you're talking about the
[1:31:57] ministry behind closed doors
[1:31:59] and you think that you're getting by
[1:32:01] with it because you're talking about
[1:32:02] somebody in the flesh you are muzzling
[1:32:05] the ox
[1:32:06] and your children will never follow this
[1:32:08] voice because
[1:32:10] of a perverted parent it's not the
[1:32:13] children's fault
[1:32:14] it's a delinquent parent
[1:32:19] [Applause]
[1:32:24] this is more in santa claus he sees you
[1:32:26] when you sleep and he sees when you're
[1:32:27] awake
[1:32:30] perry green perry green and brother
[1:32:32] billy paul went to school together
[1:32:35] and and dean saunders called called
[1:32:38] billy paul into the office and
[1:32:40] give him a riemann over over certain
[1:32:42] things and
[1:32:43] aaron and billy paul just stood there
[1:32:46] and took it
[1:32:47] and he walked out i mean he dean
[1:32:49] saunders really gave it to him is what
[1:32:51] perry green said
[1:32:52] really gave it to him billy paul just
[1:32:54] walked out
[1:32:56] and then all of a sudden dean saunders
[1:32:58] got a phone call
[1:33:00] he come out and he said perry he said
[1:33:03] did billy paul
[1:33:04] use that telephone when he come out of
[1:33:06] this room he said no sir
[1:33:08] he said why he said i just got the
[1:33:10] strangest call he said his daddy all the
[1:33:12] way up in jeffersonville
[1:33:14] just called me and told me everything
[1:33:16] that i said to his son
[1:33:19] what was it it was the god of elijah
[1:33:23] that could see
[1:33:27] he sees what you've said he knows what
[1:33:29] you're doing in your prayer life
[1:33:31] some people want god to speak to them
[1:33:33] but they picked up a bible
[1:33:35] in 10 years and they want god to speak
[1:33:38] to him if you'd open
[1:33:40] up your bible and you'd read genesis 1
[1:33:43] you could say that god spoke to you
[1:33:46] but if all you read is a newspaper
[1:33:49] you're never going to hear
[1:33:50] anything about the voice of god in there
[1:33:56] let me move on for y'all lynch me here
[1:33:58] oh hallelujah
[1:34:00] i can't say that word today let me move
[1:34:03] on before y'all
[1:34:05] just dragged me out i can't probably
[1:34:08] even say that i'm sure i offended
[1:34:09] somebody by now
[1:34:12] bless god we're in 2020. everybody's
[1:34:14] offended at everything
[1:34:16] well bless god the preacher preached on
[1:34:19] me what do you think he's going to do
[1:34:22] bless god
[1:34:29] hallelujah moses was an outlet
[1:34:34] moses heard the voice of god and he was
[1:34:36] full of theology
[1:34:38] he knowed all the ins and outs but
[1:34:40] failed
[1:34:41] he heard the voice of god and moses was
[1:34:43] never the same
[1:34:45] and no man is never the same you might
[1:34:47] hear in your ears a voice speaking
[1:34:49] but when you hear it in your heart the
[1:34:51] voice speaking then
[1:34:52] you're hearing you do not see with your
[1:34:55] eye you look with your eye
[1:34:56] you see with your heart you see
[1:34:58] something you see something and say
[1:35:00] well i just don't see it you mean you
[1:35:02] don't understand it
[1:35:03] you don't hear with your ears you're
[1:35:05] here with your heart
[1:35:07] and many times your ears hear the true
[1:35:10] voice of god
[1:35:11] and it falls off of you like water off
[1:35:13] of a duck's back
[1:35:14] but when you're really here you hear
[1:35:17] with your heart
[1:35:23] let me give you a little illustration
[1:35:26] something to make you laugh
[1:35:28] but understand what i'm saying us boys
[1:35:31] we were hunting this week
[1:35:33] and we were where gabriel was in front
[1:35:35] of me and he was driving
[1:35:37] we done been hunting we're driving back
[1:35:38] in the dark and going back home
[1:35:40] and we're coming back so gabriel
[1:35:44] gabe there's his nut walking on the side
[1:35:46] of the road
[1:35:47] it looked like he's in pitch black
[1:35:49] walking down side of road
[1:35:50] just right on the edge of the road i
[1:35:52] always love it it's like they're wanting
[1:35:54] to get hit
[1:35:57] bless god
[1:36:00] and this guy this guy's walking on side
[1:36:02] road and gabriel's in front of me and
[1:36:04] there's a little distance between me and
[1:36:05] him
[1:36:05] he's a state trooper he knows we can get
[1:36:07] by with and what things so anyways he's
[1:36:09] uh he's in front of me
[1:36:10] and he reaches down in his pocket and
[1:36:12] grabs his phone out and he he calls
[1:36:13] he goes andrew he calls he calls andrew
[1:36:16] and says hey watch out there's a guy
[1:36:17] coming upon you
[1:36:20] but he calls the wrong andrew
[1:36:24] it caused the wrong answers this guy
[1:36:27] says what what
[1:36:28] what are you talking about he said who
[1:36:31] is this he says andrew he said
[1:36:33] who's this is that escape he said huh
[1:36:36] he's like i'm sorry he said i was meant
[1:36:39] to call my cousin
[1:36:41] i spent it called my cousin andrew and i
[1:36:42] accidentally called you he said man you
[1:36:44] don't have any words somebody's about to
[1:36:45] come up and get me
[1:36:46] he said watch out for somebody they're
[1:36:48] coming up on you he said here i am
[1:36:50] sitting in my couch
[1:36:52] somebody's about to get me then he
[1:36:55] picked up the phone and he called me
[1:36:57] and you see when he called me i knew
[1:36:59] exactly what he was talking about
[1:37:01] because what the voice was saying was
[1:37:03] very relevant to me
[1:37:05] because i was following him but that
[1:37:08] other god didn't have a clue what he was
[1:37:10] talking about
[1:37:11] because the voice that was speaking to
[1:37:13] him he didn't know where it came from
[1:37:17] are you with me you see it's as soon as
[1:37:20] it came to my ears
[1:37:22] i knew what he was speaking because it
[1:37:25] was relevant
[1:37:26] to the path that i was on and when i
[1:37:30] hear this voice
[1:37:31] as it's calling out my name i know what
[1:37:34] it's taking me to
[1:37:35] because i'm on the same path there's a
[1:37:38] lot of people that it just goes off
[1:37:40] their back
[1:37:40] because they're not trained to the true
[1:37:43] voice of god
[1:37:44] because it's not relevant to them but
[1:37:47] when you hear
[1:37:48] it you know hey he's calling my name
[1:37:52] when he says hey there's somebody coming
[1:37:54] upon you jesus said
[1:37:55] hey watch out satan's got a trap you
[1:37:58] know what he's talking about
[1:37:59] because it's relevant to you
[1:38:05] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38:09] the bible said in hebrews 11 and 28 that
[1:38:12] by faith he forsook egypt
[1:38:14] not fearing the wrath of the king for he
[1:38:16] endured
[1:38:17] as seeing him who is invisible
[1:38:21] moses left egypt on two different
[1:38:23] occasions
[1:38:25] and on each occasion everyone each one
[1:38:28] were completely and distinctly different
[1:38:31] and completely different circumstances
[1:38:33] on the first time that he had moses left
[1:38:36] egypt
[1:38:37] he left israel behind in egypt and he
[1:38:39] went out in fear
[1:38:41] but when he come back the next time and
[1:38:43] he left he tripped
[1:38:44] he left with israel and he left with
[1:38:46] faith and the ultimate difference
[1:38:49] in the second time compared to the first
[1:38:51] time was because a voice had told him
[1:38:54] moses you're going down there to take
[1:38:56] over
[1:38:57] everybody else thought he was crazy but
[1:38:59] he was a channel to the world
[1:39:01] moses said he talked
[1:39:04] to a bush
[1:39:07] hat dudes nuts there's no way we're
[1:39:11] going to believe him
[1:39:12] last time i seen him he was a murderer
[1:39:14] now he's talking about a bush that was
[1:39:16] on fire
[1:39:17] and it wasn't consumed but it was a
[1:39:20] channel
[1:39:21] to the rest of the world but there were
[1:39:24] people
[1:39:25] that realized that what moses was saying
[1:39:28] was the voice of god
[1:39:30] that god had finally sent his deliverer
[1:39:33] to them
[1:39:33] and god had sent him down there to egypt
[1:39:36] to take over
[1:39:38] now notice when the prophet got down
[1:39:40] there he showed them phenomena
[1:39:41] because he was god's voice
[1:39:44] how could a man pick up dust and throw
[1:39:47] and say thus save the lord not a flea in
[1:39:49] the country
[1:39:50] and then a couple hours from then
[1:39:52] everything is crowded full of fleas
[1:39:54] not a fly nowhere at all and he said let
[1:39:56] there be flies and the first thing you
[1:39:57] know
[1:39:58] a big old blowfly began to fly around
[1:40:01] and they were bloating the people
[1:40:02] everywhere
[1:40:03] what man could do that
[1:40:08] let me ask you this what man could do
[1:40:11] this
[1:40:12] what man could speak life in the lungs
[1:40:16] that cancer was trying to stop
[1:40:21] cancer was going for a death blow
[1:40:24] what man could produce these results but
[1:40:28] god
[1:40:30] this was not a man's voice that we
[1:40:32] trusted
[1:40:33] we trusted almighty god
[1:40:39] it was god using that prophet making his
[1:40:41] word assigned to give a call
[1:40:43] we're going out of egypt but he didn't
[1:40:46] just send his voice to take them out of
[1:40:48] egypt
[1:40:49] he sent his voice his voice was sent to
[1:40:52] come out
[1:40:52] and to go into they were getting ready
[1:40:55] to make an exodus
[1:40:56] and the first exodus what did he do he
[1:40:59] brought them from a natural land to a
[1:41:00] natural hand
[1:41:01] in the second exodus he brought them out
[1:41:03] from a spiritual condition
[1:41:05] into a spiritual baptism of the holy
[1:41:07] ghost but now
[1:41:08] in this third exodus he is bringing us
[1:41:11] from a spiritual baptism of the holy
[1:41:13] ghost
[1:41:13] right back in eternal land of the
[1:41:15] millennium and the great hereafter
[1:41:18] we're not going to a land we're going to
[1:41:20] a home
[1:41:23] it's this voice that'll put us there
[1:41:27] he was so much god's voice he was so
[1:41:29] much a channel
[1:41:30] that when he stood there in front of the
[1:41:32] red sea and he said
[1:41:33] stand still and see the vow salvation of
[1:41:36] the lord
[1:41:37] and when jehovah spoke now this sea had
[1:41:41] seen a lot of things
[1:41:42] this scene had seen a lot of fish is a
[1:41:44] lot of big fishes
[1:41:46] seen a lot of people cast their net out
[1:41:47] there in that sea
[1:41:49] but they had never seen anything like
[1:41:50] this if we could have a news conference
[1:41:53] with the sea this evening
[1:41:55] and say hey see now tell me can you
[1:41:58] describe to me what you have seen here
[1:42:01] oh i don't know how i see would talk but
[1:42:06] well our theme was but the scene began
[1:42:08] to take
[1:42:09] it would begin to talk to us and he
[1:42:11] would say i seen something i've never
[1:42:13] seen
[1:42:14] you see i was made before the found i
[1:42:16] was made i was made in the world
[1:42:18] and god spoke water into existence and
[1:42:21] here i am
[1:42:22] and i've stood here every day of my
[1:42:24] existing life
[1:42:25] and i've stood here and i've watched as
[1:42:28] the water would go down and it would
[1:42:29] come back
[1:42:30] and the waves would crash on and say but
[1:42:32] this thing
[1:42:33] i saw so something so extraordinary
[1:42:38] something happened on the inside of me
[1:42:41] something began to push me up
[1:42:44] and created walls and the ground in
[1:42:48] which i had
[1:42:49] spent most of my time going over in the
[1:42:52] rocks
[1:42:53] which would be muddy it'd be clean it
[1:42:56] completely
[1:42:57] became dry and i watched people that
[1:43:00] were pretesting
[1:43:01] before the foundation of the world walk
[1:43:03] over on the ground that i had covered
[1:43:09] i'd rather hear that report than
[1:43:10] anything fox news has got to say
[1:43:12] well you say you're listening to a sea
[1:43:14] at least the c's got to testify about
[1:43:16] god
[1:43:19] hallelujah what was it it was
[1:43:22] god speaking
[1:43:27] if you would allow that voice to operate
[1:43:30] this evening it would operate in this
[1:43:32] world
[1:43:33] and it would speak things right out of
[1:43:35] existence in your life
[1:43:37] there's so much authority and so much
[1:43:39] power in the voice of jesus
[1:43:44] you as a church you know all of the ins
[1:43:46] and outs of the miracles and the power
[1:43:47] of almighty god
[1:43:51] this voice can turn situations
[1:43:56] you remember when in in the bible when
[1:43:58] when jesus said
[1:43:59] i'm close now that is resurrection power
[1:44:03] right there
[1:44:05] and watch people roll him shoulders back
[1:44:06] get ready grab your purse put your coat
[1:44:08] on
[1:44:08] get your keys he's closing
[1:44:12] sometimes i ought to say that at the
[1:44:13] very beginning
[1:44:16] see really what happens man that would
[1:44:19] mess up your minds if i said
[1:44:26] hallelujah i enjoy my jesus i don't know
[1:44:30] about you but i enjoy mine
[1:44:32] but when jesus after he had
[1:44:36] went out about his work in the day he he
[1:44:38] got in a boat
[1:44:39] and his disciples got in the boat with
[1:44:41] him but
[1:44:43] you know i love i love his story when
[1:44:45] jesus gets in the boat and there
[1:44:47] it comes a great storm out upon the sea
[1:44:50] jesus gets in the boat and what does
[1:44:52] jesus do
[1:44:53] jesus goes to sleep but what i love
[1:44:56] about this story
[1:44:57] is that jesus when when all the chaos of
[1:45:01] life was going on
[1:45:02] jesus didn't have to have a cup of
[1:45:04] folgers to wake him up
[1:45:06] and make him realize that he was jesus
[1:45:08] he woke up
[1:45:09] knowing that he was jesus and he got up
[1:45:12] and he said
[1:45:13] oh you faithless generation why are ye
[1:45:16] of little faith
[1:45:17] he didn't stumble over his words he
[1:45:19] didn't guess well i gotta have my second
[1:45:21] cup of coffee
[1:45:22] but when jesus got up when jesus got up
[1:45:26] he was jesus
[1:45:27] when jesus was sleeping he was jesus but
[1:45:30] when jesus got up he was jesus
[1:45:33] and jesus spoke peace to that storm
[1:45:37] and the disciples were in the same boat
[1:45:40] and the bible said that they
[1:45:41] marveled what matter of man is this
[1:45:45] that the winds and the sea obey him
[1:45:49] i pray to god that you would even marvel
[1:45:53] yourself
[1:45:54] when jesus gets woke up in your life
[1:45:57] oh hallelujah you ain't gotta have 15
[1:46:00] cups of coffee
[1:46:01] and a red bull to wake up jesus just
[1:46:04] wake up that spiritual life on the
[1:46:06] inside of you
[1:46:07] and watch jesus go to work
