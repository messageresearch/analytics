[1:11:49] thing just imagine what am I saying here
[1:11:52] just imagine what Jesus Christ
[1:11:54] experienced
[1:11:56] on the Mount of transfiguration is what
[1:11:58] you're going to experience that's it
[1:12:00] when I'm really placed as a son
[1:12:02] Hallelujah in the Redemption of my body

[1:13:06] put an amen after that you're going to
[1:13:08] inherit all things where do you say well

[1:13:13] I believe the word I believe the report
[1:13:15] that's right there if he said all things

[1:19:25] in in the law of the land today where
[1:19:26] people can adopt babies it's not that at
[1:19:28] all praise God the law of adoption has

[1:20:02] may you use it tonight Lord that
[1:20:04] everyone will get a portion Lord like

[1:20:09] them a big portion of bread and meat and
[1:20:11] the flagin of wine Lord may we really

[1:20:45] there in Egypt amen and then when Jesus
[1:20:48] went down there with Mary and Joseph and
[1:20:50] he said I've called my son out of Egypt
[1:20:53] and it's a wonderful thing to know a
[1:20:54] compound scripture when you read one
[1:20:57] amen so that's a compound scripture
[1:20:59] there but uh it it applies to Israel
[1:21:02] amen and in Romans 9 and 10 where Paul's
[1:21:05] going to speak so wonderfully of of the
[1:21:07] elect now over in Israel not everybody's
[1:21:11] a Believer over there there's a lot of
[1:21:13] young people these R parties and all
[1:21:16] that and they' they've LED God aside and
[1:21:18] they they they would rather go into that
[1:21:19] they think there's life in a re party
[1:21:21] well there ain't no life in a re party
[1:21:23] there's death of party Hallelujah
[1:21:26] there's death and drunkenness amen oh my
[1:21:29] and so praise God but there isn't a lack
[1:21:32] my have met some beautiful people over
[1:21:34] there that really believed and were
[1:21:36] humble and believed God and dressed like
[1:21:39] like like we dress that we The Way We
[1:21:42] believe just wonderful and it says who
[1:21:44] the Israelites to whom pertaineth
[1:21:47] adoption so they've got that plan of
[1:21:50] adoption as well that placing as a son
[1:21:53] they'll come back to that they will
[1:21:55] inherit when we when we sing that one
[1:21:57] amen therefore the redeemed of the Lord
[1:21:59] shall return they certainly will
[1:22:01] hallelujah praise God they certainly
[1:22:03] will and he'll fulfill everything he
[1:22:06] said about them amen now I want to get
[1:22:09] right on down here I don't know what
[1:22:10] time to finish it but I can only give
[1:22:12] you one promise I won't be as long as
[1:22:14] brother
[1:22:16] Tim if you can see it brother very
[1:22:21] sorry amen and so praise God yeah and
[1:22:25] and he goes on if you want to read it in
[1:22:27] chapter n there you read it yourself and
[1:22:29] uh it's about Rebecca and Isaac our
[1:22:31] father and the children not being born
[1:22:33] and not there and so then he talks about
[1:22:36] that adoption to Israel to come that
[1:22:39] 144,000 will stand Hallelujah God's word
[1:22:43] will never be broken as I said to you
[1:22:44] before I preached it to you amen
[1:22:46] scripture cannot cannot cannot be broken
[1:22:51] Hallelujah that's all it amen and as I
[1:22:54] always Billy Paul when he said this he
[1:22:56] said amen God spoke it Amen brother Bram

[1:30:12] want to hear God saying this is my son
[1:30:14] here I've sent him in your midst you

[1:30:19] I was in in in
[1:30:20] India in in this January this year and
[1:30:24] uh I was seeing so many wonderful things
[1:30:27] and one of the nicest things that stood
[1:30:28] out to me was we were having these
[1:30:30] meetings up and a a rural area like a
[1:30:34] the the tribal people were in the jungle
[1:30:36] no electricity no nothing like that but
[1:30:38] I didn't go in there we went on through
[1:30:40] the jungle on the road and we came to
[1:30:43] the the little town and we stayed in a
[1:30:45] nice place which was a surprise to me
[1:30:47] amen cuz every place I've sted at times
[1:30:50] hasn't been the nicest place you know
[1:30:52] but amen that goes with that goes with
[1:30:54] it praise the Lord and so I I remember
[1:30:57] there was about maybe 100 120 30 people
[1:30:59] in it and it was a good service and at
[1:31:02] the end of it there was a four four
[1:31:03] girls come out and you know one of the

[1:31:23] say to you tonight have you got enough
[1:31:26] Faith to believe that God will do it see
[1:31:30] this girl with a migraine here if she's
[1:31:32] here tonight I could call her right
[1:31:33] right here now and I believe God would
[1:31:35] heal her right on the
[1:31:36] spot and I mean not and this girl amen
[1:31:40] with all the pressures and you know and
[1:31:42] I said well let us pray and and we
[1:31:44] prayed for her and you know the the
[1:31:47] ministers brother Andre any of these
[1:31:49] ministers here will tell you
[1:31:51] that you know when you pray for someone
[1:31:54] you just feel if something's happened
[1:31:57] you just feel it you just know my and
[1:32:00] you stand back and say now the Lord
[1:32:02] touched you there I could say that many
[1:32:04] times not that I touched them the Lord
[1:32:07] touched you amen and so here she was and
[1:32:10] that's exactly what I did and she could
[1:32:11] speak English and I sted back and I said

[1:42:06] all but wherein he has abounded toward
[1:42:08] us in all wisdom and Prudence having
[1:42:11] made known unto us the mystery of his
[1:42:14] will all the Mysteries that we need to
[1:42:17] know about the Rapture amen praise the

[1:42:43] for our young people tonight and I'll

[1:42:47] young
[1:42:49] person okay on adoption they may be
[1:42:52] thinking sitting in a what what's this
[1:42:53] man talking about here tonight and if
[1:42:55] you do have any questions Andrew is your
[1:42:57] go-to man amen okay amen so praise God
[1:43:03] hallelujah n but amen the the the Bible
[1:43:06] term does not match in any way the legal
[1:43:09] term that we would understand it that a
[1:43:11] couple that might have a child and they
[1:43:13] can apply for adoption and a little baby
[1:43:15] might be presented and they'll adopt
[1:43:17] that little baby amen that's that that's
[1:43:20] the U that's the natural way the legal
[1:43:22] way in the land today amen but that's
[1:43:26] not what this word adoption means amen
[1:43:28] this adoption means and I'm going to say
[1:43:31] it to you Hallelujah if I can go right
[1:43:33] back to the word amen it's very hard to
[1:43:36] say it in Greek but I'm going to try my
[1:43:38] best we o s
[1:43:41] e amen we o s e that is what the word
[1:43:46] adoption means now you got to break that
[1:43:48] word up into two parts amen there is two
[1:43:50] parts to it and so the first part means
[1:43:53] a son and the second part means a
[1:43:57] placing that's what the word so every
[1:43:59] time I've read that tonight as a son is
[1:44:02] placed hallelujah amen and he is a son
[1:44:05] and he's placed something higher than
[1:44:08] he's ever known before happens to him
[1:44:11] amen and so praise God for that and uh
[1:44:14] that signifies the place and condition
[1:44:16] of a son given to one whom it does not
[1:44:20] naturally belong but he's given it to us
[1:44:23] Hallelujah by predestination amen and
[1:44:27] you know you've been taught it here for
[1:44:29] years that you were born a Son of God
[1:44:31] you were born a Son of God but you
[1:44:33] didn't know it amen you were just a
[1:44:35] sinner amen but you didn't know you were
[1:44:37] a son there was a germ of life in you a
[1:44:40] germ of God was in you like there's a
[1:44:42] germ of life in every seed that you can
[1:44:45] produce I brought I brought a potato
[1:44:47] seed down to the the the the the church
[1:44:50] I brought a little uh a lemon seedat
[1:44:52] down as well well and you can go for
[1:44:54] apple seeds or whatever seed you want
[1:44:56] but they'll bring forth after their own
[1:44:58] King you'll never get an apple tree to
[1:45:00] bring forth a lemon would not happen and
[1:45:03] so it's the same with the seed that was
[1:45:05] in us that just germ of life we were
[1:45:07] just waiting like Nathaniel was willing
[1:45:10] that day to meet Jesus Christ and when
[1:45:13] he met him he says Ah an Israelite in
[1:45:15] whom there was no G how do you know me
[1:45:17] Lord I saw you I saw you this morning I
[1:45:20] know where you were I know Jesus could
[1:45:23] said to him would you like to tell me
[1:45:24] what you prayed cuz I could tell you
[1:45:26] word for word did you ever hear brother
[1:45:28] brandham say that you lady down here
[1:45:30] you've got this hat on you've got these
[1:45:32] gloves there and a poer DOT he said if I
[1:45:36] told you word for word what you just
[1:45:38] prayed would you believe just think
[1:45:40] about it that's how real it was
[1:45:42] Hallelujah that's how real it is cuz the
[1:45:45] word has to come to the bride it has to
[1:45:48] come to the bride amen so praise God
[1:45:51] that's what we're looking for amen men
[1:45:53] and uh so because of the Fall we we
[1:45:56] didn't realize we were Sons but we were
[1:45:58] and then when that light Shone over
[1:46:01] praise God and the seed was quickened
[1:46:03] amen we heard that call that call of God
[1:46:07] somebody said hark do you explain the
[1:46:09] call of God it's just like the call of
[1:46:11] the mountains amen there was two guys
[1:46:15] Irish there would be Irish wouldn't they
[1:46:17] they were up one of these big mountains
[1:46:18] over in the Himalayas and they got
[1:46:21] trapped they got trapped
[1:46:24] amen and you would I would say to them
[1:46:26] what on Earth were you doing at that
[1:46:28] time up on a mountain like that that's
[1:46:30] what I would say but they would say well
[1:46:32] because it was there because all right
[1:46:36] fair enough amen but you know with us
[1:46:39] hallelujah we heard a call not by the
[1:46:42] human ear but we heard a call we heard
[1:46:45] the Master's Call amen it's time to come
[1:46:47] come on to me all ye that Liber and are
[1:46:50] heavy L and I will give you rest

[1:46:54] have rest in your soul it's a wonderful
[1:46:56] thing to have peace in your heart
[1:46:57] tonight and I know I could hear you
[1:46:59] singing Hallelujah you were rejoicing
[1:47:01] and praising God that's the way it ought
[1:47:03] to be amen okay as many has received
[1:47:06] them he give them the power to become
[1:47:09] the sons of God Amen we heard that call
[1:47:12] and through pre predestination it's
[1:47:14] brought us to Redemption which brings us
[1:47:16] to adoption we know we're washed in the
[1:47:19] blood of the lamb and now we want to be
[1:47:22] placed I want to hear God saying this is
[1:47:24] my son I'm not there tonight but he's
[1:47:27] there Hallelujah he's speaking for me
[1:47:29] exactly the same let me get into it of a
[1:47:31] May I'll be running out of time if I
[1:47:33] don't watch amen okay Hallelujah so amen
[1:47:37] now you know about Jesus you know when
[1:47:40] he was born that Holy thing that should
[1:47:41] be born of thee amen shall be called The
[1:47:44] Son of God so he was the son of God and
[1:47:47] here he came and he shall be called The
[1:47:49] Son of God Amen and that's true and I
[1:47:51] could never understand why by Jews they
[1:47:53] would say far be it for God to have a
[1:47:56] son amen it was God himself in human
[1:47:59] form if they want that more or less they
[1:48:02] can have it more or less it was God in
[1:48:04] human form that Jesus Christ was so here
[1:48:07] we have it amen and uh amen n and after
[1:48:12] after the bar MIT maybe at 12 and here
[1:48:15] he is coming forth n as a a young man
[1:48:18] and he goes down and he's baptized amen
[1:48:21] and I've watched you praise the Lord you
[1:48:22] know I could even say this and it's not
[1:48:25] just such a hazardous guess but I would
[1:48:28] believe that I watch the baptisms I
[1:48:30] watch brother Dylan getting baptized
[1:48:32] there the last one the other night what
[1:48:34] a what a wonderful thing for a young
[1:48:36] life to be changed hallelujah praise God
[1:48:39] to find what I've got that's what we
[1:48:41] want for everybody we meet we want want
[1:48:44] them to have what I I've
[1:48:45] got amen generally over with the
[1:48:48] Catholics they lost for prayer because
[1:48:51] my sister-in-law got a a asked from a
[1:48:53] brother I used to a fellow that I used
[1:48:54] to work with and he said my wife's got
[1:48:57] breast cancer uh would would with George
[1:48:59] can of pray for her like you know
[1:49:00] they'll do that but if you ask them
[1:49:02] about about repentance if you ask them
[1:49:04] would you believe the word would you
[1:49:05] come into something far greater than the
[1:49:07] Catholic church can give you they'll not
[1:49:09] do it amen they'll back away Hallelujah
[1:49:12] no we don't want that so that's that's
[1:49:14] these things are there amen but he went
[1:49:17] in and he was baptized and I was looking
[1:49:20] uh you know could you imagine a amen
[1:49:23] when when when uh when Isaac was
[1:49:26] baptized I'm sure a lot of you were
[1:49:28] there not night when Isaac amen breeding
[1:49:32] young Isaac was baptized and and I was
[1:49:34] there too watching it Hallelujah and
[1:49:37] I'll tell you what I would say that if
[1:49:40] Andre really looked over the year he
[1:49:42] would say that was the moment that was
[1:49:43] my highlight that was my highlight
[1:49:46] because he picked up that little boy
[1:49:47] right here in his arms and he was going
[1:49:49] to say something and he was just so full
[1:49:51] up he couldn't he couldn't speak what a
[1:49:54] wonderful thing that a little boy like
[1:49:56] that would show faith in Jesus Christ
[1:49:59] hallelujah hallelujah amen and that's a
[1:50:02] wonderful thing amen so praise the Lord
[1:50:05] and and and the Lord Jesus went in to
[1:50:07] the water was baptized and he received
[1:50:09] the Holy Ghost amen it came down upon
[1:50:11] him in the form of a dove he said this
[1:50:13] is my beloved Son he was that but he
[1:50:15] hadn't been placed he hadn't been placed
[1:50:18] Hallelujah and so that was to come amen
[1:50:21] and John the said that I bear record
[1:50:24] that he was the son of God Amen so
[1:50:27] hallelujah
[1:50:28] amen amen what what what what the Lord
[1:50:31] said uh beg your pardon just when he
[1:50:35] went up to the uh the Mount of
[1:50:37] transfiguration we'll go from that amen
[1:50:39] there he went through his ministry and
[1:50:41] coming up to the close he took them up

[1:50:45] want to get it down to you tonight amen
[1:50:47] see and uh here he was and um amen you

[2:13:41] what brother Bram says he says in my
[2:13:43] humble
[2:13:45] opinion he said to the adoption of sons
[2:13:48] that is to the placing of sons just
[2:13:50] imagine he had been baptized in the
[2:13:52] water he had received the fullness of
[2:13:54] the spirit yet God had to manifest
[2:13:56] himself and say this is my beloved Son
[2:14:01] hear ye him Hallelujah that's why we
[2:14:06] don't need to listen to Moses as regard
[2:14:08] the law because we're not under the law
[2:14:10] if you were under the law you wouldn't
[2:14:11] be be in a pitiful position because it
[2:14:13] was thou sh thou shal not th sh and you
[2:14:16] be send did did did do it did I not do
[2:14:18] it you know You' be but oh my when Grace
[2:14:21] takes over Hallelujah When Love projects
[2:14:24] Grace will take over amen and praise God
[2:14:27] as he keeps preaching to you amen you're
[2:14:29] not looking back at what you were amen
[2:14:31] you're looking back at what you are
[2:14:33] you're not looking back you're looking
[2:14:34] the miror and see yourself you're
[2:14:36] looking at what high God sees you

[2:14:40] 2024 I'm sure he does but he sees you as
[2:14:43] a stature of a perfect mind Hallelujah

[2:14:56] hope it is anyway praise God hallelujah
[2:14:59] amen hallelujah no here was the prodical
[2:15:02] and the reason brother Bram said that
[2:15:04] you know that prodical son might have
