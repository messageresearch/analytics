Lord, you heard each and every request Lord that was made mention Lord. You know every single detail Lord and you are Lord the author again and the finisher of our faith. Lord we look at the things that we don't see with eyes of faith. Many times, Lord, we're challenged to look past circumstances and events that just seem so impossible and and side effects and symptoms. But Lord, we choose your word. We look at your word with eyes of faith. And we proclaim healing upon every situation and every request that was that was read and every hand that was raised. And we proclaim deliverance.

And so we had a we had a great time and he told me this morning he reminded me of something this morning. He said uh I remember when you came to my house and said I want to talk to you as a man, not as a brother, but I want to talk to you as a man. and he said, 'You led me to the Lord.'

Nathan, we're glad to have you back with us and congratulations on on uh passing all of the things that you've had to pass. And welcome to the railroad. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Marcus, good to see you today. Amen. And each and every one of you, why don't you turn to your neighbor, good to see you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you will turn with me to Matthew chapter 21 and verse 9. Amen. Matthew 21 and verse 9. I want to speak to you today on who is Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's coming back as king. &gt;&gt; And we're going to be here with him as queen. And I think that there's ever been a day to where that this world needs Jesus. &gt;&gt; It needs it now. &gt;&gt; It absolutely needs it now. &gt;&gt; And I I'll just have to say this to you. America doesn't want the Jesus that we serve. &gt;&gt; They don't want him. &gt;&gt; The more that we go in life and the more news that we see, the more insane &gt;&gt; that it is. That's right. &gt;&gt; Israel needs Jesus. &gt;&gt; This whole world needs Jesus. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad to serve him. I'm glad to know that I know him today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew chap 21 and verse 9. And the multitudes that went before and that followed cried, saying, Hosana to the son of David. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosana in the highest. And when he was come to Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this? And the multitude said, "This is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee." If you will turn with me to Matthew 16 and verse 13. All of these are familiar text. Matthew 16 and verse 13. And when Jesus came up to the coast of Cesaria Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, this is a powerful statement, whom do men say that I the son of man am? And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist, and some Elias, and others Jeremas, or one of the prophets. And he said unto them, "But whom say ye that I am?" And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God?" And Jesus answered and said unto him, "Blessed art thou Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood, hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven." It takes a revelation to know who Jesus is. And I say also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock, I will build my church, and on the gate, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." And then charged he the disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ. Amen. Let's pray. Father, we love you today. We love you with all of our hearts and we in our humanity, we ask you to forgive us of our sins and our mistakes and our failures. We come short every day of our lives. Thoughts, words, deeds. We would ask you today that you would come and fill our hearts with your presence. Lord, there's just none like you. You have never ever disappointed me in life. Now, I ask you to come and anoint the speaker &gt;&gt; and anoint the hearer. &gt;&gt; All of us have needs here today. All of us desire more of you. &gt;&gt; We would like a revival to be set on fire in our hearts. &gt;&gt; And Lord, you're the one that can do that today. No man can do that. &gt;&gt; Lord, I ask you that you would ignite these words that we have studied. And we just ask you that you would just let them live, dear God. Live in our hearts and live in our lives. needs of our flesh, needs in our spirit, needs in the jobs, needs in the finances. You're a God that hears and understands when nobody else can do what you can do. You can come on the scene and touch us today in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. And amen. You may be seated. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Prophet said, he said, "God is either God or he's not God." Quite a statement, isn't it? Jesus either the son of God or he is an impostor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is Christ the son of God. He's not dead, but he's alive. And he lives forever more. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a good hand right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're glad to have Sister Kimberly Cabb Breeze's father with us today. Give him a great big hand. Amen. God bless you. Good to have you here. Amen. God bless you. You don't look old enough to have her as a daughter. Amen. I got my first amen out of him. So, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. We're on a good track. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13 and8 is the theme of the message. Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever. &gt;&gt; That means that his power never diminishes. &gt;&gt; He can save the worst sinner in the whole world &gt;&gt; and it does not diminish his grace or his mercy. &gt;&gt; He can heal the greatest cancer patient in the world. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It does not diminish his healing power. any whatsoever. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You can be in the greatest financial bind in the entire world and God can rescue you and it does not diminish the bank account of heaven whatsoever. &gt;&gt; That's right. He said, "I am the first &gt;&gt; and I am the last and besides me there is no God." &gt;&gt; In Revelations 1 and verse 8, I am alpha and omega, the beginning and the ending. &gt;&gt; Sayaith the Lord, which is, which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read that verse together. I like for the word to come right off of your lips. I am alpha and omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, which was, and which is to come, &gt;&gt; the Almighty. The prophet said, "Give me a church that's so completely anointed with God till every action and every move is thus saith the Lord. Walk in the shina of glory and I'll show you a Messiah anointed one of God standing on the earth." &gt;&gt; I want you to understand and this is just this is just common knowledge. God fills all time, space, and eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; He is omnisient. He is omnipotent. He is omnipresent. He is infinite. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is here now and he hears every prayer that you pray. &gt;&gt; There will be times that you feel like the power of God is filling the room. There will be times to where you feel like your prayer goes out of your lips and hits the floor. Right. &gt;&gt; But he is with you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No matter how you feel, &gt;&gt; cuz it's not based on your feelings. It's not based on your emotions. It's not based on your energies. &gt;&gt; It is based on the word of God. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you. &gt;&gt; I'll be with you." &gt;&gt; I like that with you. Don't you? Amen. &gt;&gt; 1949, brother Bram says this. He said the deity of him. Who is he? Some of them makes him a little baby back yonder. He is the one that stood on the invisible platform and rad out his hands and spoke, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; And there was light. That was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; For he was the word, the world and the world was made by him and the world recognized him not. &gt;&gt; He is the deity of God. Look what he did back there. You talk about a miraculous back there. Talk about a shouting. &gt;&gt; When he performed the miraculous things to make that which are which are now out of the things which were not, he spoke it and it was so. &gt;&gt; And that same power, that same Christ, let the fundamentalists, let them people who deny the power of God say it's wrong. But the same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right, men and women. It's time that we found out who we are. &gt;&gt; The devil is trying to hide you back and tell you that you're some little old coward down something. You're not. &gt;&gt; You are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; The deity is not in heaven. It's inside of you. I know you think I'm crazy, but let me just tell you something, brother. When you realize that almighty God lives in you, &gt;&gt; immortal life, my life I give you, Zoe, God's own life, the life of God, lives in a human being. &gt;&gt; He stood back there. He's the creator of all things. He made frogs, bees, ducks, chickens. &gt;&gt; Everything that was ever made, he made it. &gt;&gt; Who was he? Christ, the deity. He brought down plagues and everything in the days of Egypt. He stopped the mouths of lions. He quenched the violence of fire. They escaped the edge of the sword. They raised the dead from the grave. Who is it? Christ. &gt;&gt; That's my Jesus. &gt;&gt; Philippians Philippians chapter 2 and verse 10. The name of Jesus. Every knee shall bow. &gt;&gt; At the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow of things in heaven and things on the earth and things under &gt;&gt; brother. But they won't do that today. They will. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They will. &gt;&gt; In Acts 4 and verse 10, be it known unto you, unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at the not of you the the builders which has become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For there is none other name. &gt;&gt; There's none other name unto heaven given unto men whereby that we must be saved. Ephesians chapter 3 and verse1 14. For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named. &gt;&gt; Does that mean anything to me brother? You're Mrs. Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and everything he owns you own. &gt;&gt; All the power that he has you have. Come on. &gt;&gt; So you can say to your trouble, leave. He was a man when he was weeping. But when he stood and straightened his little frame up and said, "Lazarus, &gt;&gt; come forth." &gt;&gt; A man that had been dead for 4 days come out of a grave. &gt;&gt; He was more than a man. &gt;&gt; Corruption had set in. And the master knew that he was the creator. And when he stood down there on the mountain, one night he was hungry and looked up around and and something to eat and couldn't find nothing. He was a man. He was hungry. But when he took five biscuits &gt;&gt; and two pieces of fish, &gt;&gt; I want you to understand, not just fish, cooked fish. &gt;&gt; Not just bread, cooked dough. and he breasted it. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Listen, us Christians know how to eat. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me when we leave church, the first thing we looking for is something to eat. &gt;&gt; These people were hungry. They had been listening to Jesus preach for a while. &gt;&gt; And you know, when Jesus got to preaching, &gt;&gt; he wasn't preaching to teacup Christians. He was preaching to people for hours and they got hungry. &gt;&gt; Brother Ray, I can imagine as the disciples said, "We got to send them away. We don't have enough to give them. We can't feed them. It would cost thousands of dollars in this day. &gt;&gt; What do we have here?" And a little boy maybe that has skipped some school was about to get some physics lessons. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; And he took two pieces of fish. &gt;&gt; They wasn't great big fish. This little boy had to had to carry them. &gt;&gt; And there wasn't five great big old biscuits. &gt;&gt; They were they were catad biscuits. You know, once in a while, Sister Connie gets in a mood, and I can see her over working, and she really don't want me to see it, but she's making catad biscuits. Let me tell you about catad biscuits. &gt;&gt; They begin to spread out. They go good with butter and jelly, but they go better with gravy. &gt;&gt; You want to make a man happy, put some gravy on his plate. &gt;&gt; Put some biscuits on there. Jesus known how to make people happy. &gt;&gt; There wasn't none of those disciples could fathom what was about to take place because Jesus was more than a man. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you tonight, you can come here in this building today and God knows how to meet every one of your needs. And &gt;&gt; he begin to break the bread. Had to be some baskets around and he be to break the bread and he be to bless the fish. &gt;&gt; Now I don't know I wasn't there but I want to tell you that everybody grabbed their portion. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if you're feeding guys like brother Metas, he's grabbing some portion. &gt;&gt; He know how to grab two or three plates at the same time. But that little boy was getting ready to watch multiplication &gt;&gt; take place. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, what a miracle. But you remember there was also a miracle when he said, "Let there be." Amen. &gt;&gt; And that sun that we love to see come up in the morning. &gt;&gt; And when we're hunting and a big old buck is standing in front of us, we're saying, "Come up quicker." &gt;&gt; And that sun is always on time &gt;&gt; and it's rays a beam. And God spoke that into existence. &gt;&gt; When he made the sun, the moon, and the stars, he did it with purpose. That's right. &gt;&gt; Listen. The waves on the earth of the sea had to have boundaries. &gt;&gt; So he put the moon at a certain spot &gt;&gt; to watch over the earth that it wouldn't flood. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Listen, the moon's not just up there man and the moon. I want you to know God placed it on a purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That the gravity would just be exactly right. God did it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you look down at your hands, God made your hands for a purpose. &gt;&gt; In your hands, you have the ability to feel. &gt;&gt; You know what's hot and you know what's cold. You know what's tender. You know what's hard. &gt;&gt; Your little bitty hands reached up to your mother &gt;&gt; and you trusted her. &gt;&gt; And her hands may be scarred by washing dishes and taking care of the house. Her hands were so tender to you. &gt;&gt; What a mother's touch can do. &gt;&gt; You with your little hands reached up and could hold a hold of her hands. I want you to know we need to put our hands in the hands of God. &gt;&gt; There are times in the trials of your life when you can't get mama and you can't get daddy. Come on. &gt;&gt; You can reach your hands into his hands. &gt;&gt; He was a man when he tried to lay out there in a little old ship. &gt;&gt; It was tossing about like a bottle stopper on a mighty ocean. 10,000 devils swore &gt;&gt; that they would quit kill him. Swore that they would drown him. He was a man that was laying there in that ship. But when he was put his foot on the brow brow of that boat, &gt;&gt; and he looked up and said, "Peace, &gt;&gt; peace, &gt;&gt; be still." Come on. &gt;&gt; That roaring sea became glass. &gt;&gt; What about your storm today? &gt;&gt; What about your storm? &gt;&gt; He was a man when he stood there and cried for mercy upon the cross. But when he broke the veil of the tomb, he was the mighty cocker. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Listen. Without a resurrection morning, we're all lost. &gt;&gt; There would be no resurrection. Without a cross, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We're all lost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There would be no forgiveness. &gt;&gt; That's right. Greater is he. He's God, the creator. &gt;&gt; The winds and the waves had to obey him. &gt;&gt; Demons became paralyzed in his presence. &gt;&gt; Nature obeyed him because he was the creator of every creature. All right, &gt;&gt; I'm trying to behave here. &gt;&gt; And when we think about that, it takes the bite out. Then think about it, understand these things. What is it? It isn't man. Man cannot do that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Man is a part of creation. &gt;&gt; But the winds and waves had to obey the creator. &gt;&gt; It takes a creator to do that. Amen. &gt;&gt; For he that's in you. &gt;&gt; For he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; He can cause the turmoil that's in this world. He that's in you is the creator &gt;&gt; who made the winds. Who rebuked the devil out of the winds. And there is calm. He can rebuke the devil out of your storm. &gt;&gt; Men will take decades to try to figure out things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Decades. And it takes God a second. &gt;&gt; And I would say something smaller than that, but millisecond. It actually don't take God no time cuz he feels all time, space, and eternity. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; In John chapter 6 and verse 49, he says, "I am the bread of life." He said, "Your fathers did eat man in the wilderness and are dead." And he said, "This is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die." Now notice this step. This next statement is going to get him killed. I am the living bread &gt;&gt; which come down from heaven. &gt;&gt; And if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever. and the bread which I give unto thee is my flesh which I give you give for the life of the world. And the Jews therefore sought among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat? &gt;&gt; It had to blow their mind. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a man, except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood," we're going to have communion here a little while. "Ye have no life in you. And whosoever eat of my flesh and drinkkeeth of my blood shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day." &gt;&gt; You talking about a promise. &gt;&gt; If you eat this word, For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. And he that eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood dwelleth in me, and I in him, as a living father hath sent me, and I live by the father. And so that he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. That's right. &gt;&gt; This is the bread which came down from heaven, not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead. And he that eateth of this bread shall live forever. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand God God knows exactly what he deposited on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what he deposited on the inside of you. All of us have a different look. &gt;&gt; All of us have different hair. We all have different eye colors. We all have different fingerprints. We all are built of this human natural DNA. And God watched over your DNA. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I've said it many times. I'll say it again this morning to drive a point. If you've ever seen a miracle, look in the mirror. &gt;&gt; There it is. God watched over your humanity. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; Just to get you here. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; And if you remember, every act there's a million cells that is thrown forward. But only one is given life. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; When you were born and given life, nine nine n9 died. [Music] God watched over that since Adam. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother Ryan, I there's too many things that's bigger." Let me just say, if God did all that to get you healed, &gt;&gt; are you with me? So many times we limit God. God watched over your human DNA all the way down here. That's right. &gt;&gt; The scripture said you were fearfully and wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; Quit trying to act like somebody else. &gt;&gt; Quit trying to imitate somebody else. &gt;&gt; Be you. &gt;&gt; They watched over you to get you here. $5 five by 10. He watched over you to get you here. Then he says, "I want to live in you." &gt;&gt; Now, it's not your flesh that he's got confidence in. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's not your flesh, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because you even disappoint yourself. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; You disappoint one another. &gt;&gt; That's right. If you're married, you know that you should have said &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Cuz stuff happens, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So God does not have confidence in your flesh. &gt;&gt; He has confidence on the seed of God that he put there before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; You see, that seed is part of himself. That's right. &gt;&gt; God deposited there. He's got confidence in that. Let me just give you a for instance. Watch this. When Adam and Eve was in the Garden of Eden, under the serpent's seed, she was to be destroyed. &gt;&gt; But under the seed of Adam, because he was a part of God, God would not destroy her. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because a part of God was in Adam and then inside of her. &gt;&gt; You remember a lady named Ruth? &gt;&gt; Listen. And God watched over her through all the failings of humanity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But one day, there was a part of the seed of God that was planted in her womb. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; I just like to shout over this for a while. She was a part of another kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; She was a part of another gentile dispensation. But because of the seed &gt;&gt; of the line of the tribe of Judah was planted in her womb, &gt;&gt; she became as eternal as Jesus Christ is eternal. &gt;&gt; What about Esther? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What about all the ladies of grace? What about you? &gt;&gt; I got news for you. We were all nobodies &gt;&gt; in this world. But when Jesus came, he made you a somebody. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, I I I don't feel like nobody. Let me just give you a first instance here just for a moment. You guys work in a bank. Does the president of the bank ever come in? Occasionally, but he don't walk in and go, "I'm the president of this bank." No, he don't do that. He don't have to go in any office that he goes in and go, "I'm the president." &gt;&gt; He don't have a certain attire that he wears. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He just walks in. He goes to his office, goes to his desk, and just puts his coffee cup down. What's really important to him is he don't spill his coffee between car and desk [Applause] &gt;&gt; cuz he knows who he is. &gt;&gt; He's got the job. &gt;&gt; He's not worried. Somebody else is going to take the job from him. Let me just say this. You, you are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; You don't have to spend your whole day going, I'm a son of God. I'm a son of God. You are a son of God. Just live. Just breathe. &gt;&gt; Now, the devil will turn tell you otherwise. He'll get in your ears. He'll get in your mind. &gt;&gt; But you must remember that he is a liar &gt;&gt; and the father of all lies. &gt;&gt; And he don't have the right, are you with me now? &gt;&gt; To rule your soul. Come on. &gt;&gt; You are a son of God. &gt;&gt; Don't pay no attention to him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 24, there was two boys that was walking away from the Lord. The crucifixion had happened. The disciples were bewildered. And these two guys were going home. They were going home discouraged. They were going home wondering what's next. You know, they they didn't know &gt;&gt; their leader, their Messiah had been crucified and they put him in a grave. And at that point, it was even a borrowed grave. &gt;&gt; And the treasure of the church had went and hung himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; They were bewildered. They didn't know what to do. Who is Jesus? What was Jesus? Now they had all kind of questions. And a man appeared unto them and began to walk with him and they didn't recognize him. Right. And he began to walk with him and and ask them, "Why are you distraught? Why are you so trouble troubled? Why are you so tore up?" And they begin to talk to him. Now, it's a six-hour journey. And they begin to talk to him. Have you not heard? &gt;&gt; We've been following this man for three years. We thought &gt;&gt; And Jesus be to talk. And he begin to take the words of the Old Testament and all the prophets and he begin to bring up this this prophecy and that prophecy and he would say, "Did he fulfill it?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, yes, he did. And he would bring up the prophecies of David. Did he fulfill it? &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. Did he fulfill Jeremiah? Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; Did he fulfill of Isaiah? &gt;&gt; Was he born of a virgin? Yes, he was. Was he hung on a tree? As a matter of fact, he was. Was he wounded for your transgressions and bruised for your iniquities? &gt;&gt; Did he get beat? Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; Jesus could have stopped and had a prayer, had a had an oldfashioned sermon right here, but he just kept trying to get their eyes to come open. Oh, &gt;&gt; did he fulfill? Did he fulfill? Did he fulfill? Did he do what he said he would do? &gt;&gt; Cuz listen, if your eyes ever come open &gt;&gt; and the revelation of who Jesus Christ is, when it comes open, &gt;&gt; you won't have to worry about 50 people trying to convince you of another way. When your eyes come open, then you know him personally for yourself. That's my Jesus. That's my king. That's my savior. He's my healer. He's my mighty God. I trust in him. I believe him. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to believe your your lie. I believe him with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, it came a while to where Jesus was getting ready to pass their house and he made as though he was going to go on in his journey. &gt;&gt; I want I want to remind you of a simple principle. He wants to be invited. He wants to be invited. &gt;&gt; Just something about God. He wants to be invited. Oh, he's there, but he wants to be invited. &gt;&gt; Why don't you invite him to your breakfast table? &gt;&gt; Won't you invite him to your bedroom? &gt;&gt; Why don't you invite him to supper? &gt;&gt; Why don't you invite him to get in the car with you and Rod? &gt;&gt; Won't you invite him to your job? He'll come. He lays brick. He He's a welder. &gt;&gt; He's a banker. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He's a preacher. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How long has it been since you and Jesus had some fellowship? &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ron, I'd just like for you to come by my house and have coffee. Somebody greater than me &gt;&gt; wants to come to your house. &gt;&gt; Does he drink coffer? He &gt;&gt; brews. Amen. &gt;&gt; When I get rid of all this chemo and I get my taste buds back, I'm going to drink some coffee again. &gt;&gt; I can't wait till that day I can start drinking coffee again. Some of you missed it. You say, "Well, brother, I don't know if God likes coffee." He brews More of you got it today, but some of you get it tomorrow. Some of you get it next week. Some of you get it in your Bible. You Some of you get it. Sir, no need to go any further. Why don't you come on in? We've enjoyed six hours of company. We've enjoyed what you had to say. Would you come in? We'd like to feed you a little bit. &gt;&gt; We got We got a good drink for you. &gt;&gt; May not be what you're used to eating, but we'd like to have you there. &gt;&gt; And so being invited, he steps on in their house. Now, it might have been a a common house. It didn't have to have gold on it. It didn't have have to have all the best in it. It's your house. Hallelujah. I don't care if you live in a tent or you live in a castle. You need to have Jesus there. &gt;&gt; And don't forget he's there. &gt;&gt; Don't entertain everything else and forget Jesus over in a corner. &gt;&gt; They invited him. You know, they had bread today. special day. Fresh break bread was ready. And they him being the guest, they said, "Won't you break it?" Well, that was a good good thing to have him as a guest to break bread. Now, they had seen Jesus break bread because they were there when he fed 5,000. They had watched him at the communion at the last supper breaking bread. It's only been just a few days ago, but today it's in their house. &gt;&gt; I can't imagine how it felt. As I was thinking about it this morning, I can't imagine when all the inspiration of everything he's told us for six hours and now in this moment. In this moment, we realize that's him. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you about what a moment will do. It'll heal your body. It'll bring peace to your soul &gt;&gt; in a moment. You go, "That's not just the pastor. That's him." &gt;&gt; Let's tell you. And he begins to break the bread and their eyes come open. And he broke their piece. Let me tell you something. I'm not a selfish person, but I want my peace. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm not the kind of a guy that's a jealous guy, but I want my peace. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, when I come to church, &gt;&gt; I'm not thinking about Walmart. &gt;&gt; I'm not thinking about basketball and football and baseball. I'm not thinking about a cook roast on the pot. I'm not thinking about none of that. I'm thinking about I got to get to Jesus. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I can I can only imagine as that piece come broke off of that big piece and he handed it to Ron. This is your piece. And when I looked up in those big eyes, those eyes were crucified for me. those hands. When he opened his hand with a piece of bread in it, there was a duct. That's right. &gt;&gt; The only man-made thing in heaven will be the nail scars in his hands &gt;&gt; for an eternal reminder of the price that he paid for me and you. Don't never allow the cross to be common. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't never allow the blood of Jesus Christ to become common words over your lips &gt;&gt; because without it, we're lost. &gt;&gt; I don't care if you're the best giver to all of the Kowanas and everything else. I don't care if you got more deeds than anybody else of goodness. Your goodness won't save you. &gt;&gt; Being born in a certain family won't save you. &gt;&gt; Being the president of the United States of America won't save you. &gt;&gt; Without the blood of Jesus Christ, you're lost. One of my favorite preachers was preaching about 150 years ago. What a rough fella Peter Cartwright was. And so happened one of the generals had stopped by for service and the pastor pulled on Peter Cartwright's coattail and said, "The general, top general, is in the building." And he said, "I don't care if the general's in the building. If he's not born again, that's right. &gt;&gt; If he's not born again by the blood of Jesus Christ, he's lost and he's going to a devil's hell." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The next morning, the general knocked on his door and he said, "Mr. Gartright, I want to thank you. I want to thank you for telling me the truth. &gt;&gt; If every one of my soldiers, if every one of my soldiers had the fight that you have for Jesus Christ, we'd win the war overnight. &gt;&gt; Amen. when their eyes came open, they saw it was Jesus Christ. I think sometimes we must remember that he's our champion. So many times as young people, we get the idea that Michael Jordan is a champion, and he is in this realm. Elvis Presley was a king of rock and roll. But you can have all of that and not have Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and you're lost. I think sometimes we get this idea that this guy is bigger than life. This this great person, this great personality is bigger than life. But if they're not if they're not saved and born again, &gt;&gt; they're lost. &gt;&gt; Be careful who you make your hero. That's right. &gt;&gt; That wasn't a part of the sermon, but that's that's that's good enough for you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? In Psalms chapter 23, the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, and he leadth me beside of the still waters. He restoth my soul, and he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. And yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they do comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemy. Thou anointest my head with all, and my cup runth over. Notice these next words. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand, God dwells in the praises of his people. &gt;&gt; And if you ever want him to come, just start praising him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So many people are afraid to praise God. Come on. &gt;&gt; They're afraid to praise the Lord because they may get a little out of You didn't mind it at a ball game. &gt;&gt; You didn't mind it at a race car. &gt;&gt; You didn't mind it at a hockey game. &gt;&gt; I got all those Canadians right there, didn't I? And for the Europeans that are watching today, you didn't mind it at a soccer match. Listen, God deserves our praise. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He deserves our worship. &gt;&gt; He deserves it. &gt;&gt; Whether you feel like it or you don't feel like it, &gt;&gt; whether you're in the mood or you're not in the mood, Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You might feel like God's 10 million miles away, but he might be. But he hears hears your prayer. He still hears your praise. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, it's been a big question. Do you know him? &gt;&gt; In John chapter one, and this is going to be my closing scripture today. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehendeth it not. There was a man sent from God whose name was John. And the same came for a witness to bear witness of that light that all men through him might believe. He was not the light but was sent to bear witness of that light. That was the true light which lighteneth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not. The Jews don't know him. I'm sorry. They thought they thought he was a man. &gt;&gt; But I believe in a short time they're getting ready to find out who he was. &gt;&gt; We've all got common sense here. I hope we do. &gt;&gt; And we know America needs to know him. Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what political affiliation you are, America has lost its way. &gt;&gt; 40 thousand 40,000 different denominations in the world and they still can't figure out who he was. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I'll say just a couple more things here. Who is Jesus? He's my king. That's right. &gt;&gt; I am a citizen of another kingdom. &gt;&gt; This world is not my home. &gt;&gt; I'm only passing through. &gt;&gt; Brother Anya, let me just share this with you. This week, I went to the I went to see the cancer team, brain cancer team. Had a test run, had my MRIs run. I came in and I I saw a doctor and the first doctor I began to tell him how that I I I couldn't throw a ba a baseball or a football and and catch with my my grandchildren because I see two balls coming. I said, "Therefore, we we throw foam balls." And so he he just talked to me. He said, "Well, how do you do on steps?" I said, "Well, at home, I don't have any problems." I said, "But at church or I had problems with steps." He said, "At home, you've got muscle memory." He said, "But when you climb somebody else's steps or you climb other steps, you have to watch each one that you make the next step or the step down the next step." He said, "I can't fix that." He said, "That's damage from the brain surgery that you had." Begin to talk. He's light-hearted fell. is just wonderful guy that we talked to and he was with me for about a half an hour and then the head head doctor come in. You've met him and he come in and he sat down and he talked to me and he said, "Well, your brain scan is clear." &gt;&gt; I like that. Now, in saying that, they consider me still a fourth stage cancer fighting cancer deal because the big stuff's not working. The little stuff that they don't pay no attention to is in there. So, we continued to take chemo every day. I don't like it. Wears me out, makes me sick, make me a lot of different things. And so he recorded and he recorded and recorded and then he came to a certain spot and he hit his recorder and said now I want to talk to you now you'll be interested in this and he said we have conferences to where that we gather doctors from all over the world and he said we talk about brain metastasis and he said in and and it comes from your lungs it comes from all over your body and it travels into the brain and he said somewhere between cancer and your body it will begin to communicate with the cancer that goes into your brain and they communicate backwards and forwards. He said there's a blood band, you probably know this, you're Mr. He said there's a blood band between your brain and your body and he said that's the why we keep giving you chemo because it takes that chemo so long to get up in that brain to work. Now, you know, they're they're telling me sentences of death, but the Bible tells me sentences of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he he said, "We have a conference about every three months." And he said, "We gather these doctors from all over the world." And he looked at me, he said, put his hands on my knees and he said, "I would like for you to be a spokesman for us." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "We don't have another one like you." &gt;&gt; What'd you do, brother Ron? I accepted the job. What do you think I would do? Hallelujah. That's my Jesus. Isn't he wonderful to us today? &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful to us today? Thank you. Thank you for being here. Don't you love him? Amen. Amen. Are we ready for the Lord's supper? Amen. Hope I didn't hold you too long. I wanted to make time for the Lord's supper and the communion, the foot washing. And we welcome everybody to to be a part of this today. I pray that we all sit at the same table one of these days, thousands of miles long. If you're a sinner today and don't know the Lord, I want to tell you, he's here for you. You just ask Jesus into your heart. Ask, "Forgive me of my sins, Lord. Come into my life. I want to serve you the rest of the days of my life." If you're so sick you can't stand yourself, won't you ask him to heal you? &gt;&gt; Won't you ask him to heal you? Amen. I was so weary this morning. I didn't know if I was going to be able to preach this sermon, but a certain buddy came back and prayed for me. He laid his hands on me and said, "Lord, give him the strength to preach." I want to thank you. I want to thank you. I want to thank you, brother Ron. You're getting all those good reports, but you don't understand. I've been on chemo for five and a half years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's worked on my body. And so, thank God Connie regulates the naps. Naps. Naps. Amen. Amen. God bless you. [Music] 1 Corinthians chap 11 [Music] verse 23. For I have received of the Lord that which also I have delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, he took bread, and when he had given, he broke and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." And after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament, and my body this do you as often as you drink in remembrance of me. For as often as you drink this bread, eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death until he comes." [Music] Who am I that the highest would welcome me? I was lost but he brought me. Oh, his love for me. Oh, his love for me. set free. This is free. [Music] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am free. Unless he has rest as his grace was a slave to Jesus died for me for glory through the sun set free is free. I'm a child of God. Yes, I am. [Music] In my father's house, there's a place for me. I'm a child of God. Yes, I am. At this time, we're going to dismiss the uh viewing audience. Just want to say God bless you. Thank you for being a part of our service today. Amen.
