[49:21] see that Jesus is not in some borrowed
[49:23] tomb over across the Eastern Shore
[49:27] but he's right here he's right in this
[49:30] room and he's right here in living in
[49:32] our hearts filling our lives touching us
[49:36] happy
[49:37] Easter happy Easter oh what a what a
[49:40] time what a time it is to be living in
[49:43] the hour that we are living in right now
[49:44] to see to see what the physical
[49:47] manifestation of the Holy Ghost is doing
[49:49] right here amongst us and and we're just
[49:51] bringing good reports and I'm sure more
[49:54] to come from the camp there in Louisiana
[49:56] and I know I know that you parents that
[49:58] sent your kids off and I know that
[50:00] you're going to be bringing back some
[50:02] different kids and it's very very
[50:04] powerful just hearing how the Lord
[50:06] worked amongst uh I know um just two or
[50:11] three that I know from our group um
[50:13] testifying they received the baptism of
[50:15] the Holy Ghost last night so every
[50:17] energy every everything that we've put
[50:20] into these camps has been worth it for
[50:24] one but to bring back a test testimony
[50:27] that you're bringing kids back
[50:28] differently than the camp is a great
[50:30] success and to that we're grateful uh we
[50:33] want to be remembering our pastor
[50:34] brother Ron is as he's uh I'm sure he's
[50:37] very wore out today and and uh so we
[50:40] just want to be remembering him remember
[50:42] our families are traveling back home
[50:44] from from Louisiana being in the camps
[50:46] there and they got a big journey in
[50:48] front of them but the good thing they
[50:50] got a lot of testimonies to share all
[50:52] the way and I'm sure it'll take all 17
[50:54] hours of them to share it all so we're
[50:56] just uh very very thankful for all those
[50:59] things and uh happy to have uh the king
[51:01] family uh from Farmville is that
[51:03] correct no pens of this all right all
[51:07] right I'm getting this straightened and
[51:08] from Farmville okay all right so and uh

[52:02] appreciate you uh just bearing with us
[52:04] in all of that and it'll all come
[52:06] together and uh in his timing but the
[52:09] Lord keeps adding Lord keeps adding we
[52:11] might have to uh just tear the whole
[52:13] thing down and so start all over from
[52:16] scratch so God's got an idea of what
[52:18] he's doing with us and it ain't just it
[52:20] ain't just in the natural but it's it's
[52:22] in the spiritual and he's building us up
[52:24] and I tell you I I'm just so excited so
[52:26] excited to be living right here right
[52:28] now in the hour one of these mornings it
[52:30] ain't just going to be us talking about
[52:32] Jesus getting up from the grave but
[52:33] we're going to watch our physical loved
[52:35] ones raise up and manifest right in
[52:37] front of our eyes it's Easter we should
[52:40] expect these things it's in the
[52:42] atmosphere we're in a moment we ought to
[52:45] praise the Lord for it all amen amen how
[52:49] many has a need today that you'd like to
[52:51] make known unto the Lord amen I know
[52:54] we've asked you that hundreds and
[52:56] thousands of time setting here but today
[52:59] I believe that every single one of your
[53:00] needs even though he could have met him
[53:02] this past week from last week and you
[53:05] raising your hand but right now we're
[53:07] needy people but I believe that the god
[53:09] of the Resurrection is here in the room
[53:13] uh he's here in the room and I believe
[53:15] with all of my heart he's able to reach
[53:17] into that realm and touch your life
[53:19] maybe brother to a brother sister to a
[53:21] sister we just bind our faith together
[53:24] amen let's just let's just lay our hands
[53:26] hands upon one another because there are
[53:28] special Miracles that are done when a
[53:29] body begins to unify together father we
[53:32] approach you father today in the most
[53:35] humble way that we know how father Lord
[53:37] what a resurrection that this is to see
[53:40] father that the Sun is up to recognize
[53:43] what you've brought us from what you've
[53:44] called us from and we want to express
[53:47] with everything that is within us thank
[53:50] you for this Easter morning thank you
[53:52] for the resurrection oh God and I pray
[53:55] father today that you would just come
[53:56] and flood this atmosphere and you would
[53:59] just fill this place with your presence
[54:01] Lord the atmosphere the songs of Zion
[54:04] have been sing but Lord we are asking
[54:06] father that you'd come in word father
[54:08] you'd come in deed and that you'd come
[54:10] in Liberty and you'd come father and
[54:12] you'd minister to us Lord through the
[54:14] preaching of the word for that is where
[54:16] us as your children We Gather our
[54:18] strength from and I pray father that
[54:20] you'd meet these needs that have been
[54:21] lifted up to you father by the way of an
[54:24] uplifted hand father there are needs
[54:26] there are situations there are questions
[54:29] that need to be answered there are
[54:31] things father that only only you can
[54:34] answer and I pray father that you'd come
[54:36] today now father we see the physical
[54:39] proof that you are alive that it's not
[54:41] just something that we've heard about
[54:43] but you're right here in the room you've
[54:46] gathered with us Lord to speak to us and
[54:48] the Bible said that where the Eagles are
[54:51] gathered the carcass is there father so
[54:53] we recognize that the carcass is here
[54:56] the
[55:28] [Music]
[55:56] in uh in the Book of Matthew chapter 27
[56:00] verse 52 Matthew chapter 27 and verse
[56:25] 52
[56:44] amen Matthew chapter 27 and verse 52 and
[56:48] then we'll turn down to Matthew chapter
[56:50] 28 and the Bible said and the graves
[56:53] were
[56:54] opened and many bodies of the Saints
[56:57] which slept
[56:58] arose and came up out of the graves
[57:02] after his
[57:03] resurrection and went into the holy city
[57:06] and appeared unto many Matthew chapter
[57:09] 28 and verse
[57:11] one and in the end of the Sabbath as it
[57:14] began to Dawn toward the first day of
[57:17] the week Came Mary Magdalene and the
[57:19] other Mary to see the SRE and behold
[57:22] there was a great earthquake for the
[57:24] angel of the Lord descended from
[57:27] heaven and came and rolled back the
[57:30] Stone from the door and sat upon it and
[57:33] his countenance was like lightning and
[57:35] his rainment was white as snow and for
[57:37] fear of him the keepers did shake and
[57:41] became as dead man I think it's amazing
[57:44] that we recognize that this was not just
[57:46] a n ordinary man that came but this was
[57:49] a Angelic messenger that came from
[57:52] heaven and what we see that brother
[57:54] Brandon would talk to us and he would
[57:56] tell tell us that that there we watch he
[57:58] said there that morning star came all
[58:00] the way from glory and it was shining as
[58:03] it came down there and he come rolling
[58:05] down through there and he said he said
[58:07] he come down through there and he said
[58:08] with just the brush of his hand he
[58:11] rolled the stone back he rolled the
[58:14] stone back it was proof when you read
[58:16] the Scripture it was proof of what was
[58:18] happening on the inside because of the
[58:21] Angelic Messenger on the
[58:24] outside and for fear of him did the
[58:26] keepers did shake and became his dead
[58:28] man I I think it's amazing that here we
[58:31] recognize that these are some of the
[58:33] greatest Centurion soldiers that there
[58:35] is these are men that have been known to
[58:38] be Mighty Men of of fighting of Warriors
[58:41] these men and notice that at the very
[58:44] sight of that angel they begin to get
[58:46] scared and run away and I think it's
[58:48] amazing when we recognize that
[58:50] Resurrection it Resurrection can bring
[58:52] fear it can bring fear to a sinner but
[58:55] it brings consolation to a real believer
[58:58] and the angel answered and said unto the
[59:00] woman fear not ye for I know that you
[59:03] seek Jesus which was crucified he is not
[59:06] here for He Is Risen as he has said come
[59:09] and see the place where the Lord lay and
[59:11] go quickly and tell his disciples that
[59:14] he's risen from the dead behold he goeth
[59:17] before you into Galilee there shall you
[59:19] see him lo I have told you and they
[59:22] departed quickly from the SRE with fear
[59:25] and great joy and did run to bring his
[59:29] disciples words also 1 Thessalonians
[59:32] chapter 4 and verse
[59:35] 14 let's go to verse
[59:38] 13 here Paul says but I would not have
[59:41] you to be ignorant Brethren concerning
[59:44] them which are asleep that you sorrow
[59:45] not as even as others which have no hope
[59:49] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[59:51] rose again even so them also which sleep
[59:55] in Jesus will God bring with him for
[59:59] this we say unto you by the word of the
[1:00:02] Lord that which are alive and remain
[1:00:05] under the coming of the Lord shall not
[1:00:07] prevent them which are asleep for the
[1:00:10] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:00:12] with a shout with a voice of an
[1:00:14] archangel and with the Trump of God and
[1:00:16] brother brandham said in a Rapture
[1:00:18] Rapture message he said God does all
[1:00:20] three of those things at one time while
[1:00:23] he's descending and the and the dead in
[1:00:27] Christ shall rise for first then we
[1:00:30] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:00:32] caught up together with them in the
[1:00:34] clouds to meet the Lord in the air so
[1:00:37] shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore
[1:00:40] Comfort one another with these words may
[1:00:43] God bless his word you may be seated
[1:00:45] here in the presence of the Lord today
[1:00:48] I'd like to take a thought to speak to
[1:00:50] you on today on the dawning of a new day
[1:00:53] the dawning of a newe day and there is
[1:00:55] no Gra that can hold this body down
[1:00:58] because we recognize that here we are
[1:01:01] watching one of the greatest events that
[1:01:02] we've ever seen throughout the
[1:01:04] throughout the course of humanity
[1:01:06] because all the way back in the Garden
[1:01:07] of Eden there we watch the very fall of
[1:01:10] humanity where God speaks to Adam and
[1:01:14] Eve and tells them that you're able to
[1:01:15] eat of every tree of of of the garden
[1:01:18] but that of the tree of the knowledge of
[1:01:20] Good and Evil don't touch it for thou
[1:01:22] Willl surely die and ever since then
[1:01:25] ever since then death has been raining
[1:01:28] had been raining upon the Earth for
[1:01:30] 6,000 years it had rained upon the Earth
[1:01:33] or 4,000 years it had rained upon the
[1:01:35] Earth and there were mighty men that
[1:01:38] came there was men like Abraham that
[1:01:39] came and he died there was there that we
[1:01:42] just spoke of Adam he died even though
[1:01:45] he would live way up into his late late
[1:01:48] years of his life but even he would die
[1:01:51] even Methuselah that he would he would
[1:01:53] come to be one of the most oldest men
[1:01:55] that is that is recorded in the Bible
[1:01:57] but none of them were able to reach the
[1:01:59] age of a thousand years old because that
[1:02:02] is a sign that that is a it is for a
[1:02:05] millennial Reign type of people that
[1:02:08] have went beyond death but even in
[1:02:11] throughout all the ages there were men
[1:02:13] that would rise men of Great Men of
[1:02:15] Great Men that would rise and they would
[1:02:17] die but there was something that was
[1:02:20] always that was lingering upon humanity
[1:02:23] is there a way out of death even John
[1:02:26] the Baptist he was there was the Bible
[1:02:28] said that there was none greater than
[1:02:30] John the Baptist and the Bible said that
[1:02:32] that Jesus said that he was more than a
[1:02:34] prophet because he was not just a
[1:02:36] prophet but he was a prophetic messenger
[1:02:38] under the age that he was going to but
[1:02:41] Jesus was not just a prophet Jesus was
[1:02:44] not just one of the boys Jesus was not
[1:02:46] just a good man Jesus wasn't a man that
[1:02:49] just went about Healing The Sick and he
[1:02:51] wasn't that kind of a man but this was
[1:02:53] almighty God that was dealing or
[1:02:55] dwelling in human humanity and dwelling
[1:02:58] in human flesh and to think that there
[1:03:01] was a man that could live on Earth in
[1:03:04] humanity like you and I are living in
[1:03:06] and the Bible recorded that never a man
[1:03:09] spake like this there was everybody that
[1:03:12] anybody that had the power to be able to
[1:03:14] speak to the winds and the winds would
[1:03:17] cease there was never anybody that could
[1:03:19] that could do the things that he was
[1:03:21] doing it was because the indwelling of
[1:03:23] the Holy Spirit was was from the very
[1:03:27] Throne of God it was it was God himself
[1:03:31] living on the inside of Jesus Christ's
[1:03:34] body Hallelujah and to think that when
[1:03:37] Jesus is standing there in Revelations
[1:03:40] 1:7 that John said that when I saw him I
[1:03:43] fell at his feet as dead and he laid his
[1:03:46] right hand upon me saying unto me fear
[1:03:48] not I am the first and the last and I am
[1:03:52] he that liveth and was dead let's say
[1:03:55] that together and was dead and behold I
[1:03:58] am
[1:03:59] alive happy
[1:04:02] Easter happy Easter behold I am alive
[1:04:06] forever more and have the keys of hell
[1:04:09] and of death when Jesus rose up on
[1:04:12] Easter morning he had something in his
[1:04:15] hand that had been locked away since
[1:04:17] Adam death had locked man in a cave
[1:04:21] death had locked him into a place that
[1:04:22] he couldn't get himself out of but when
[1:04:25] Jesus rose up on Easter morning he had
[1:04:27] the key to it he had the key to it and
[1:04:31] the only way that you're going to ever
[1:04:33] escape get out the door is to go by the
[1:04:35] one that's got the key to it because man
[1:04:38] had always feared death because they had
[1:04:41] not an assurance of ever coming back
[1:04:43] again after they died but job asked this
[1:04:46] question one time when he was speaking
[1:04:48] to the Lord he said if a man die shall
[1:04:51] he live again is that righty that's a
[1:04:54] very good question to ask if a man man
[1:04:56] die shall he live again job was looking
[1:04:58] at nature and he'd seen the flower how
[1:05:00] that it would die in the wintertime how
[1:05:02] it would go to the how that he would go
[1:05:04] to its grave but then in springtime he
[1:05:07] would raise back up again so job had a
[1:05:10] question he had a question about it if a
[1:05:13] man die shall he live again because job
[1:05:16] was looking at something job was
[1:05:18] catching a vision of something that man
[1:05:20] needed an escape out of death job knew
[1:05:25] something that he needed a redeemer all
[1:05:27] the prophets spoke about this Redeemer
[1:05:30] David said in Psalms 49 and 15 that my
[1:05:34] God but God will redeem my soul from the
[1:05:38] power of the Grave that he shall receive
[1:05:41] me sh so there is something that is that
[1:05:45] was constantly that was weighing on the
[1:05:47] thoughts of God's children is there
[1:05:50] power from the
[1:05:52] grave is there power from the grave
[1:05:55] youve bu a lot of you've buried a lot of
[1:05:57] your your young people you've buried a
[1:05:59] lot of your loved ones you buried a lot
[1:06:01] of family members but we don't we don't
[1:06:03] just rest assure we don't just rest
[1:06:06] assure in the box that we put them in
[1:06:08] because the box that we put them in in
[1:06:10] in just a few days they will never look
[1:06:13] the same as what they were here but
[1:06:16] there is something that has the power to
[1:06:18] get them out of that grave and job was
[1:06:21] wondering about this can a man if he die
[1:06:24] can he live again and one day when job
[1:06:27] was out there and he was talking with
[1:06:29] God he done went through some trials he
[1:06:31] done went through some Saturdays and he'
[1:06:33] come to a spot where he was considering
[1:06:36] all of these things and all of a sudden
[1:06:38] brother brandom said that he caught a
[1:06:40] resurrection he caught a resurrection
[1:06:42] Vision he caught the inspiration he said
[1:06:45] for I know that my redeemer liveth and
[1:06:48] that he shall stand at the later day
[1:06:50] upon the Earth and though after my skin
[1:06:53] worms destroy this body yet in my flesh
[1:06:58] shall I see God now think about this
[1:07:01] Easter proved that job's Revelation was
[1:07:05] right that the prison house that men
[1:07:07] wanted to get out
[1:07:10] of the Grave that concealed them that
[1:07:13] Easter was the way out of
[1:07:16] it let me say it like this Easter
[1:07:19] settled Easter settled all the questions
[1:07:22] that there was a man who said I have
[1:07:25] power to lay my life down and I got
[1:07:28] power to raise it up again this Easter
[1:07:31] proved that what job saw was a physical
[1:07:35] manifestation of what the Revelation
[1:07:37] Hallelujah of what he
[1:07:40] caught now think about this job is the
[1:07:43] very first book in the
[1:07:45] Bible you don't see it till it gets into
[1:07:47] the until you get into the Psalms until
[1:07:50] you get into the Poetry part of the
[1:07:52] Bible but job is the very first book of
[1:07:55] the Bible
[1:07:56] that's been written and job is grabbing
[1:07:59] a revelation before Moses ever writes
[1:08:02] down what Adam has seen job is catching
[1:08:06] this Revelation I think it's a very
[1:08:09] powerful thing to to identify yourself
[1:08:11] with the power of Revelation because job
[1:08:15] had caught a hold of something that was
[1:08:17] going to link all of the prophets
[1:08:19] together they was going to testify about
[1:08:22] it but job was going to say I know he's
[1:08:25] not just the god of the dead but he's
[1:08:27] the god of the living I'll tell you how
[1:08:30] powerful job's Revelation was is that
[1:08:33] Abraham caught that Revelation and said
[1:08:35] I'll tell you what he said if job's got
[1:08:38] that kind of Revelation I'm not going to
[1:08:40] bury my wife down here in any other
[1:08:43] place he said I've got to bury her over
[1:08:46] in mpela where job said that there's
[1:08:49] going to come a
[1:08:50] resurrection so what did Abraham do
[1:08:54] Abraham do have this re ation yet but he
[1:08:57] has Hallelujah but what did he do he
[1:08:59] tied himself together by the revelation
[1:09:02] of what job had seen that there was a
[1:09:05] redeemer that was
[1:09:08] coming when Abraham goes to buy the
[1:09:12] piece of property that his sweetheart
[1:09:14] Sarah as she's just passed Beyond passed
[1:09:17] beyond the realm of Tears he goes to buy
[1:09:20] this this land of mcpa and the men that
[1:09:23] own that property said no no Abraham
[1:09:26] we're going to give it to you because
[1:09:27] you're a righteous man and Abraham so
[1:09:30] said no I'm going to buy this piece of
[1:09:32] property I want to pay for this piece of
[1:09:34] property and they they argued with him
[1:09:36] they tried to bicker with him they tried
[1:09:38] to give him a deal but Abraham said no
[1:09:41] I'm going to buy this piece of property
[1:09:44] because you see what it was a sign of it
[1:09:46] was the same thing that when Jesus was
[1:09:48] up there in Matthew chapter 4 when Satan
[1:09:52] was trying to offer him a kingdom
[1:09:54] without going to the
[1:09:56] calvary of going and pay the price it
[1:09:59] was a sign of Abraham having to pay the
[1:10:01] price for the gray out of the
[1:10:05] Grave that's the same way he'll do you
[1:10:08] that's the same way that Satan will do
[1:10:10] you he will offer you religion without
[1:10:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost come on
[1:10:15] somebody he'll offer you easy believism
[1:10:17] without fully surrendering your life
[1:10:20] over ah come on somebody it's Easter
[1:10:23] morning but it goes down in history that
[1:10:26] Abraham when he purchases this piece of
[1:10:29] ground it's the most expensive piece of
[1:10:32] ground that has ever been purchased
[1:10:35] throughout Humanity that Abraham buys
[1:10:38] this piece of property do you recognize
[1:10:41] that on Friday on Good Friday that when
[1:10:44] Jesus was up there dying on the cross he
[1:10:46] was making the greatest purchase that
[1:10:49] there ever had
[1:10:51] been he wasn't just doing that he wasn't
[1:10:54] just doing that for for himself he was
[1:10:56] doing that to purchase the greatest
[1:10:59] piece of property that could ever be
[1:11:04] purchased I hope you recognize who I'm
[1:11:07] talking about today I'm talking about a
[1:11:09] people that have the power to recognize
[1:11:12] that if job had a revelation how much
[1:11:15] more should you have a revelation that
[1:11:17] you don't have to go by the way of the
[1:11:19] Grave you don't have to go through
[1:11:20] trials you don't have to go through
[1:11:22] situations without recognizing there is
[1:11:25] a
[1:11:25] Redeemer there is a power there is an
[1:11:28] anointing there is a
[1:11:31] life come on somebody without this
[1:11:33] message there is no life but Jacob and
[1:11:37] Joseph tap thems into that Revelation
[1:11:40] when Jacob was down there in Egypt and
[1:11:44] he'd been that he'd been touched by the
[1:11:46] angel and he told Joseph said lay your
[1:11:48] hands right here on the inner part of my
[1:11:51] thigh Lay Your Hands there where the
[1:11:53] angel touched me and never walk the same
[1:11:56] again Joseph I want you to swear to me
[1:11:59] that you won't leave my bones laying
[1:12:00] down here in Egypt what was he saying to
[1:12:03] Joseph he said there is no power down
[1:12:06] here to get me out of the grave in Egypt
[1:12:09] but take my bones and bury them in
[1:12:13] Palestine every day of their life when
[1:12:16] the Israelites were in slavery when they
[1:12:18] were walking by that where and they were
[1:12:20] walking past that coffin they could look
[1:12:23] over there and they could catch a vision
[1:12:26] maybe they had been beat that day maybe
[1:12:28] they had been mocked that day maybe
[1:12:30] they' been criticized that day but they
[1:12:32] could catch a vision that there is
[1:12:34] somebody that
[1:12:36] testified there's somebody that
[1:12:38] testified that there's coming a
[1:12:40] resurrection what are you talking about
[1:12:42] brother Andrew I'm talking about when
[1:12:44] you get in your worst moments take a
[1:12:46] look and capture vision of the cross
[1:12:49] that identifies you don't have to go by
[1:12:52] the way of the Grave you don't have to
[1:12:54] go down in trials there's somebody that
[1:12:56] paid for you to go in a
[1:13:01] Rapture what am I saying to you I'm
[1:13:03] saying There Ain't No
[1:13:05] Grave There Ain't No Grave that could
[1:13:08] hold this body down because on
[1:13:11] Resurrection
[1:13:14] morning this ain't this is more than a
[1:13:16] song this is more than a song when Claud
[1:13:19] Eli from the hills of Virginia when he
[1:13:21] wrote that song he had been he had been
[1:13:24] struck down with tuberculosis and he was
[1:13:27] in a spot of death and his family had
[1:13:30] been gathered around him said prepare
[1:13:32] for death prepare prepare it your your
[1:13:34] loved ones getting ready to die but they
[1:13:37] begin to pray the prayer of faith over
[1:13:39] the Evangelist Claude
[1:13:41] Eli and he come up out of that moment
[1:13:45] and he started writing down this song
[1:13:47] There Ain't No Grave going to hold this
[1:13:50] body down well early in the morning
[1:13:53] about the break of day and an angel came
[1:13:56] from heaven and he rolled the stone
[1:13:58] away now if a sick man can rise up out
[1:14:02] of that condition and he could write
[1:14:03] that kind of a song what about your
[1:14:05] testimony this morning you're not sick
[1:14:08] but you know and you caught a
[1:14:12] revelation you've c a revelation that
[1:14:14] there is a power that can take you out
[1:14:17] of the Grave there's an anointing that's
[1:14:20] why that's why Joseph would say well
[1:14:22] don't leave my bones down here they were
[1:14:25] carrying when they were coming out of
[1:14:27] Egypt they were carrying his bones what
[1:14:29] were they
[1:14:31] doing when they were without Vision they
[1:14:34] could lay a hold of somebody that
[1:14:36] already had a vision and when you are in
[1:14:38] despair you can look over and tap in
[1:14:41] that there was a prophet that came in
[1:14:42] this generation that came in this
[1:14:45] generation to give you a vision that
[1:14:48] there is life and there is proof that
[1:14:50] dry bones can live
[1:14:53] again dry bones can live again the Bible
[1:14:56] said for if we believe that Jesus died
[1:14:59] and rose again even so them which also
[1:15:02] in sleep in Jesus will God bring with
[1:15:05] him how are you so sure that you're
[1:15:08] going to make it brother Andrew because
[1:15:10] Paul said in 1 Corinthians 12: 13 for by
[1:15:13] one Spirit we are all baptized in one
[1:15:17] body in Jesus Christ's
[1:15:19] name come on
[1:15:22] somebody do you know what I'm talking
[1:15:24] about this morning
[1:15:25] I'm saying to you don't you bury me like
[1:15:28] Joseph had don't you bury me down there
[1:15:30] in Egypt there ain't no life down there
[1:15:33] don't bury me down there in some Creed
[1:15:35] don't bury me in some denomination don't
[1:15:37] bury me in some trinitarian Doctrine
[1:15:40] bury
[1:15:42] me bury me where there's life at where
[1:15:46] there's power at where there's an
[1:15:47] anointing
[1:15:49] at I guess I'm going to preach by myself
[1:15:51] today but don't you dare try to bury me
[1:15:54] in some water down grave of what people
[1:15:57] think the message is bury me where the
[1:15:59] power
[1:16:01] is I know you can get shook up about
[1:16:04] what the world's doing but don't you
[1:16:06] bury me down there in that kind of
[1:16:08] ideology but bury
[1:16:10] me bury me where there's life at bury me
[1:16:13] where there's power at bury me where
[1:16:15] there's Truth
[1:16:18] at that's what all them
[1:16:21] prophets said if job's got that
[1:16:23] Revelation to be buried there the you
[1:16:25] bury me there you bury me where job's
[1:16:28] going to be living at and what was it on
[1:16:30] Easter when he resurrected from the
[1:16:33] grave that the graves were open and them
[1:16:38] that had died in faith did Jesus bring
[1:16:41] with him now notice what the Bible said
[1:16:44] in 1 Corinthians 15 and 20 but now is
[1:16:47] Christ risen from the dead and become
[1:16:49] the first fruits of them that slept for
[1:16:52] Since By Man Came Death By Man Came also
[1:16:55] the resurrection of the Dead for as in
[1:16:58] Adam all die but even so in Christ shall
[1:17:02] all be made
[1:17:05] alive shall all be made alive ain't it
[1:17:09] powerful to know that by Adam came death
[1:17:12] but by the second Adam came life and
[1:17:15] life more abundantly and that's what
[1:17:17] Satan's objective to do is to send you
[1:17:21] to a premature grave his whole intent
[1:17:24] and his motive is to send you to a
[1:17:26] premature
[1:17:28] grave he'll bury you up with drugs he'll
[1:17:31] bury you up with alcohol he'll bury you
[1:17:33] up with all kinds of sin all kinds of
[1:17:36] troubles all kinds of rejecting Spirits
[1:17:38] upon
[1:17:41] you and he's trying to send you to a
[1:17:44] premature grave but the God of this
[1:17:46] message knows how to shut the door of
[1:17:49] the Grave I said you can't have them
[1:17:51] alcohol you can't have them drugs you
[1:17:53] can't have them s you can't have them
[1:17:56] problems you
[1:17:58] can't hallelujah hallelujah he's greater
[1:18:02] than drugs you can testify can't you
[1:18:05] sister Devon he's greater than alcohol I
[1:18:07] could call your name he's greater than
[1:18:09] sin I could call your
[1:18:13] name oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:18:16] he ain't talking about death he's
[1:18:18] talking about
[1:18:19] life this message didn't come to bury
[1:18:22] you up with some kind of Theology and
[1:18:24] give you a new idea it come to give you
[1:18:26] a
[1:18:27] relationship with the power that raises
[1:18:30] from the
[1:18:33] dead that's just wait lay some word in
[1:18:36] here Hosea 13 and 14 said I will Ransom
[1:18:40] them from the power of the
[1:18:42] grave and I will redeem them from death
[1:18:46] oh death I will be thy plues oh grave I
[1:18:50] will be thy destruction repentance shall
[1:18:54] be hid from my
[1:18:55] house we all love we all love the story
[1:18:59] of Hezekiah how that Hezekiah
[1:19:03] prayed he turned his face to the wall
[1:19:05] and he began to weep and ask God for
[1:19:07] more years to be added onto his life but
[1:19:10] I love I love reading hezekiah's Psalm
[1:19:13] of Praise in Isaiah
[1:19:16] 38:18 this is a man that knows what he's
[1:19:19] talking about he's just been at the
[1:19:21] point of death where a prophet comes
[1:19:22] knocks on his door and said prepare for
[1:19:25] death but because he had the power
[1:19:27] inside of him to turn his face to the
[1:19:29] wall and pray notice what verse 18 say
[1:19:33] for the grave can't Praise You death
[1:19:36] cannot celebrate you the they that go
[1:19:39] down into the pit cannot hope for thy
[1:19:41] truth the living the living shall praise
[1:19:44] thee as I do this day for the father to
[1:19:48] the children shall make known thy
[1:19:53] truth
[1:19:56] Hallelujah for the Lord was ready to
[1:19:58] save me therefore will we sing my songs
[1:20:03] Oh to the string instrument all the days
[1:20:05] of our life in the house of the
[1:20:08] Lord Hezekiah wasn't singing David's
[1:20:12] song he was singing hezekiah's song and
[1:20:15] if you know what it's like to be safe
[1:20:17] from sin you ain't singing brother Ron's
[1:20:20] testimony you ain't singing brother
[1:20:22] Andrew's testimony you ain't singing
[1:20:24] David's
[1:20:26] testimony but my songs come on somebody
[1:20:30] if you're in that spot and you feel like
[1:20:31] you got more life left in you all you
[1:20:33] got to do is turn your head to the Lord
[1:20:36] say God I got more power in Me God I got
[1:20:38] more life in me I'm not done with my
[1:20:40] Ministry yet and turn your face to the
[1:20:43] wall and said God if you send me to the
[1:20:46] Grave then somebody after there won't be
[1:20:49] able to praise you no more but if you
[1:20:51] raise me back
[1:20:53] up
[1:20:55] Hallelujah some of you was in Graves of
[1:20:58] of denominationalism some of you was in
[1:21:00] Graves of all kinds of all kinds of
[1:21:03] dirty habits but I want to announce to
[1:21:05] all of Hell There Ain't No Grave that
[1:21:08] can hold this body
[1:21:11] down come on somebody the church World
[1:21:14] tried to bury you up with their ideas
[1:21:17] but There Ain't No
[1:21:18] Grave sin tried to Barry bury you up and
[1:21:21] cover you up but the deeper you bury the
[1:21:24] the true seat of God when the sun begins
[1:21:27] to
[1:21:28] rise the more beauty that comes
[1:21:31] forth that's why God has giv you beauty
[1:21:34] for your
[1:21:36] [Applause]
[1:21:37] ashes hallelujah hallelujah I ain't just
[1:21:41] talking about some natural grave I'm
[1:21:43] talking about a spiritual grave There
[1:21:45] Ain't No Grave no pornography habit no
[1:21:48] suicide Spirit no depression no anxiety
[1:21:52] no fear
[1:21:57] I know what I'm talking about brother
[1:21:58] Justin when grave when the grave was
[1:22:00] calling your name there was a pastor
[1:22:02] that stood here and said let's pray for
[1:22:04] our brothers let's pray for our police
[1:22:07] officers and because there was somebody
[1:22:10] that was trying to send you to a
[1:22:11] premature grave there was a higher power
[1:22:14] said not today
[1:22:17] [Applause]
[1:22:20] Satan
[1:22:22] Hallelujah then fear has no hope
[1:22:25] anxiety has no hold the
[1:22:30] grave what am I saying I'm saying that
[1:22:32] the grave has no power over this
[1:22:40] body you can bury Lazarus but when Jesus
[1:22:44] is coming just get
[1:22:47] ready come on when Jesus is on your
[1:22:51] road there ain't a stone that can stand
[1:22:54] in his way
[1:22:57] I love
[1:22:58] this that God the God that was on the
[1:23:02] inside of that grave on Easter morning
[1:23:04] had the
[1:23:05] ability had the ability to blast it
[1:23:08] completely
[1:23:10] away did he
[1:23:11] not did he not because he stood there
[1:23:14] later in that chapter and said all power
[1:23:17] is given unto me in heaven and in Earth
[1:23:22] I love this I love this and brother
[1:23:24] Brandon would say he said before the
[1:23:27] resurrection he could not say that all
[1:23:29] power in Heaven and Earth is given unto
[1:23:31] me he said but after the resurrection he
[1:23:34] could stand there and say all power in
[1:23:36] heaven and in Earth that was showing
[1:23:39] that an Angelic messenger was coming to
[1:23:42] roll the very stone of death out of your
[1:23:45] life what am I saying to you I'm saying
[1:23:48] that there was an angel that stood in
[1:23:50] this generation that rode the stone of
[1:23:53] hell away from you
[1:23:56] oh blessed be the name of the Lord Psalm
[1:23:58] 6:5 said for in death there is no
[1:24:01] remembrance of thee in the grave who
[1:24:04] shall give you
[1:24:07] thanks Lord if I go to the Grave I know
[1:24:11] there's a bunch of people out there that
[1:24:12] won't Praise You But If You Raise Me Up
[1:24:15] Lord I'll praise you till there's not
[1:24:18] any more breath in my
[1:24:20] lungs the grave can't Praise Him
[1:24:23] church that's that's why you got to come
[1:24:25] out of the
[1:24:26] Grave come on you can't keep you can't
[1:24:29] be hiding back there you can't hide in
[1:24:31] the shadows no more because in the grave
[1:24:33] you can't praise him but when you get on
[1:24:35] the outside of the Grave you can say go
[1:24:37] tell my disciples that Jesus still lives
[1:24:41] I think it's a very powerful thing that
[1:24:43] we witness that God still lives and God
[1:24:45] still Reigns right here in this
[1:24:48] generation when God would raise up a Joe
[1:24:50] Robinson that should have been gone by
[1:24:52] the way of the grave but it's a
[1:24:55] testimony that there is no power in the
[1:24:57] grave over a seed of
[1:25:01] God oh brother maram comes in true
[1:25:05] Easter seal he grabs some thoughts and
[1:25:08] says he said what is what is Easter mean
[1:25:11] he said he said I he said he said I know
[1:25:13] what that Easter seal he said what it
[1:25:14] means of them people standing out there
[1:25:15] trying to take up contribution he said I
[1:25:18] think they're doing a great thing he
[1:25:19] said but what does Easter mean to
[1:25:22] us he said I know what they're doing he
[1:25:24] said they're trying to raise up uh money
[1:25:26] to make people more comfortable in the
[1:25:28] in the hospitals of tuberculosis and
[1:25:30] different things they had their seals up
[1:25:32] on it he said but what does the Easter
[1:25:34] seal mean to you and I surely Easter's
[1:25:37] got to be more than just a seal of
[1:25:39] making people more comfortable is that
[1:25:41] right Easter's got to mean something and
[1:25:43] I believe that Easter meant so much to
[1:25:46] the Christian church and to our
[1:25:47] Christian Heritage he said it's the Seal
[1:25:50] of the Resurrection that's what Easter I
[1:25:53] know what Easter means to me
[1:25:55] but what does it mean to you I think
[1:25:57] it's a good question to ask what does
[1:25:59] Easter mean to you well let me just tell
[1:26:01] you what it means to me I don't have to
[1:26:03] go back to no cold formal dead religion
[1:26:06] no more I don't have to go back to drugs
[1:26:08] no more I don't have to go back to a way
[1:26:10] of living where I didn't know whether I
[1:26:12] was going to live today or die tomorrow
[1:26:15] I know what Easter means to me but what
[1:26:18] does it mean to you for by death for man
[1:26:22] came by death but by man also so came
[1:26:24] the resurrection of the
[1:26:27] life what's Easter mean to
[1:26:29] you come on now what's Easter mean to
[1:26:35] you Easter mean to you brother David
[1:26:38] told me last weekend I hope it's all
[1:26:40] right and I don't think you mind telling
[1:26:41] cuz he told
[1:26:44] me anything that you tell a preacher can
[1:26:47] be used against
[1:26:49] you but he told me he told me he said
[1:26:52] ever since I was 13 years old he said
[1:26:54] said I drink hard liquor every day of my
[1:26:56] life he said but after coming here
[1:26:59] second time coming here he said the
[1:27:01] complete desire has completely gone away
[1:27:04] I'll tell you what Easter means to
[1:27:05] Brother
[1:27:08] David how about you Sister Mary what's
[1:27:12] Easter mean to
[1:27:13] you when a lot of people walked away and
[1:27:16] it looked like you should have walked
[1:27:17] away too but God rich in Mercy Easter
[1:27:21] meant something to you because it wasn't
[1:27:23] just Easter for Jesus Jesus it was
[1:27:25] Easter for
[1:27:27] Mary Hallelujah come on out of it come
[1:27:31] out of the cold religion come out come
[1:27:34] out of the ideology come out of
[1:27:36] formalism you've got enough Liberty in
[1:27:38] this room right now to resurrect
[1:27:42] yourself a we going somewhere church but
[1:27:45] there's enough Liberty right here in
[1:27:46] this room that will one of these
[1:27:48] mornings between the hours of 600 and 9
[1:27:50] it'll be one of these atmospheres
[1:27:53] that'll physically change our mortal
[1:27:58] bodies you all the time talking about
[1:28:00] atmosphere that's exactly right because
[1:28:02] it's an atmosphere that'll sweep into
[1:28:04] the room it's an atmosphere if you build
[1:28:06] it up in Holy Faith and you build it up
[1:28:08] with worship one of these days oh
[1:28:11] blessed be the name of the
[1:28:13] Lord now notice notice what the Bible
[1:28:17] said in Leviticus chapter 23 and the
[1:28:20] n9th chapter to the 11th verse and
[1:28:22] brother rer picks this up and it is the
[1:28:24] rising of the sun he said now he said
[1:28:26] listen close in the law the levitical
[1:28:28] law of God speaking to Moses said listen
[1:28:30] all these things are types now he said
[1:28:32] we stop here for a few minutes to get
[1:28:34] this type he said and the Lord spake
[1:28:36] unto Moses saying Speak unto the
[1:28:38] children of Israel and say unto them
[1:28:40] when you come into the land which I give
[1:28:42] unto you notice what brother random
[1:28:45] said unto the place under the position
[1:28:49] that I've given unto you notice brother
[1:28:51] Ram catches and places it perfect
[1:28:54] perfectly in position for the bride when
[1:28:56] you come into the land or when you come
[1:28:58] into the place the position that I've
[1:29:00] given unto you he said now you speak to
[1:29:03] the children of Israel that when you get
[1:29:05] to this certain place that I promised
[1:29:06] you I take you when you get there in
[1:29:09] this land now notice he said speaking to
[1:29:12] Natural here he said but typen the
[1:29:15] spiritual and he said and shall reap the
[1:29:17] Harvest thereof you have received what I
[1:29:19] told you thereof then you shall bring a
[1:29:22] sheath of the first fruits of your
[1:29:24] Harvest under the priest and he shall
[1:29:26] wave the sheath before the Lord to be
[1:29:29] accepted for you on the tomorrow after
[1:29:32] the Sabbath the priest shall wave it now
[1:29:36] notice what he goes on to say he said if
[1:29:38] there would have been any holy ritual he
[1:29:39] said it should come forth on the Sabbath
[1:29:41] day which was the seventh day of the
[1:29:44] week which is Saturday he said but did
[1:29:46] you notice in this Memorial it was to
[1:29:49] wave it on the first day of the
[1:29:53] week
[1:29:56] it'll sink in a minute but did you
[1:29:58] notice in this Memorial it was to wave
[1:30:01] it before the Lord on the first day of
[1:30:05] the week the sheath which was the first
[1:30:07] of your seed that you planted when it
[1:30:09] comes up and ripened you cut down the
[1:30:12] sheath and you took it to the priest and
[1:30:14] let him take it and wave it before the
[1:30:17] Lord for your exception that you are
[1:30:23] accepted
[1:30:27] child could fall in here and hurt
[1:30:29] himself and we'd hear
[1:30:32] it but he waved he waved it before the
[1:30:36] Lord for your exception before the Lord
[1:30:41] what is happening it's before the Lord
[1:30:44] for your exception not on the Sabbath
[1:30:47] day the seventh day but on the first day
[1:30:51] which is called Sunday
[1:30:56] what are you trying to say to me I'll
[1:30:58] make it real clear it ain't Saturday no
[1:31:04] more the silence is over what are you
[1:31:07] saying to me brother Andrew quit you
[1:31:09] crying kid quit you weeping weeping may
[1:31:13] endure for the night but joy comes in
[1:31:16] the morning I'm trying to get something
[1:31:18] to you that it ain't just Saturday no
[1:31:21] more Hallelujah it ain't a day of rest
[1:31:24] no more it's
[1:31:25] Sunday it's Sunday oh blessed be the
[1:31:29] name of the Lord he said course he said
[1:31:31] that's a Roman word he said which they
[1:31:33] called it the Su day Su n the day for
[1:31:37] the Sun God he said but how it has
[1:31:40] changed he said it's no more Su n
[1:31:43] anymore but it's s o n d a y the Sunday
[1:31:49] that the corn of wheat God's first one
[1:31:52] up from the dead is to be be waved over
[1:31:55] the congregation that we are the seed
[1:31:59] and the first of that seed of those that
[1:32:01] slept waved upon the first day of the
[1:32:07] week Hallelujah on Sunday on Sunday he
[1:32:12] raised up and he waved goodbye and he
[1:32:15] sended up on high in the presence of the
[1:32:19] people what am I saying to you that that
[1:32:22] which was in the natural when the first
[1:32:24] one come to Resurrection the high priest
[1:32:27] would wave it before the
[1:32:30] congregation but when Jesus the corn
[1:32:33] wheat that fall into the ground if it
[1:32:36] die it abideth
[1:32:39] alone but if it die it'll bring forth
[1:32:42] much fruit what was it it was a memorial
[1:32:47] day that it was waved out across the
[1:32:52] crop
[1:32:55] what was it a sign to all of Israel that
[1:32:58] there's more
[1:33:01] coming Satan I got bad news for you it
[1:33:04] ain't just Jesus that's coming it ain't
[1:33:07] just Paul that's coming it just ain't
[1:33:09] arenus that's coming it ain't just
[1:33:10] Columba that's coming it ain't just
[1:33:12] Luther that's coming it ain't just
[1:33:14] Wesley that's coming it ain't just an
[1:33:16] isus of Pentecost that's coming but this
[1:33:18] is a restoration of the Bride tree let
[1:33:21] me say it's more than just William
[1:33:22] brandham coming it's more more than Ron
[1:33:24] Spencer coming it's more than Andrew
[1:33:26] Spencer coming but they're sons of
[1:33:29] God what are you witnessing weekend
[1:33:32] after weekend it's the waving of the
[1:33:34] sheath that is going across the
[1:33:37] generation the name of the lord it's a
[1:33:40] sign that if he rose I'll rise with
[1:33:46] him I'm preaching you the message it's
[1:33:49] because he was the first Son of God to
[1:33:51] come to full maturity he was plucked up
[1:33:53] from the Earth and was waved over the
[1:33:56] people he said but what this is was it
[1:34:00] was really the first fruits of them that
[1:34:02] slept and was waved over the promised
[1:34:05] seed that had a promise of life in it
[1:34:09] because if that seed has not been
[1:34:22] deratization you that he that attracted
[1:34:26] him to
[1:34:28] you that's what brother random said in
[1:34:30] Christ The Mystery of God revealed that
[1:34:31] God loved fatherhood so he became a
[1:34:36] father because he had sons that was
[1:34:39] going to raise up what was it it's a
[1:34:42] sign that he didn't just get up out of
[1:34:44] the Grave that he didn't just get up and
[1:34:47] raise up on Easter morning but it's a
[1:34:49] sign to a
[1:34:50] generation that if that spirit that ra
[1:34:53] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:34:56] you it'll Quicken your mortal bodies and
[1:34:59] brother brandom said there's the catch
[1:35:01] right there but if but if that Spirit
[1:35:06] but if that Spirit dwells in
[1:35:09] you but if that spirit that dwells in
[1:35:12] you if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:35:15] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:35:17] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:35:19] also Quicken or make alive your mortal
[1:35:22] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:35:26] you the spirit that dwells in you is the
[1:35:29] same spirit that was waved over the
[1:35:33] congregation brother Bram brother bham
[1:35:36] comes in and he he ties some things
[1:35:38] together and I think it's very beautiful
[1:35:39] the brother bandam goes all the way back
[1:35:41] in the Old Testament and he begins to
[1:35:43] tie some things together of his
[1:35:45] resurrection and our resurrection and he
[1:35:48] goes in there and he starts talking
[1:35:49] about the first resurrection and then he
[1:35:51] starts talking about our Resurrection he
[1:35:53] said if you look at Elijah and Elisha he
[1:35:56] said it's like a bird he said they've
[1:35:59] got he said a bird's got two wings and
[1:36:01] it's got a balance itself it's got to
[1:36:03] balance itself he said Elijah was the
[1:36:06] Translating Wing he said but Elisha was
[1:36:09] the resurrection
[1:36:11] Wing well blessed be the name of the
[1:36:13] Lord he was the Translating Wing but
[1:36:16] this was a resurrection Wing notice the
[1:36:19] same power that got Elijah across the
[1:36:22] Jordan was a same double portion that
[1:36:25] got Elisha back over and he didn't stand
[1:36:28] out there and say where is Elijah
[1:36:31] at now Brad I'm talking to you he didn't
[1:36:34] come out there and said where's Elijah
[1:36:36] at he stood out there and said where is
[1:36:39] the god of Elijah act let me say this to
[1:36:42] you William brandham ran his part he ran
[1:36:45] his race but now it's your turn to run
[1:36:49] this race with every with everything
[1:36:52] that's within you where is the god of
[1:36:54] Elijah I'll tell you he ain't in some
[1:36:56] tomb he ain't in some grave he ain't in
[1:36:58] Eastern Shore he's in this
[1:37:03] body oh blessed be the name of the
[1:37:07] [Applause]
[1:37:08] Lord give me my double portion I know
[1:37:10] you're asking a hard thing but let me
[1:37:12] say this to you that what you're asking
[1:37:14] of it's a hard thing but it's a
[1:37:16] righteous thing that what Jesus did you
[1:37:20] can do also because that quickening
[1:37:22] power it's not the power of a man it's
[1:37:25] the power of God what is it it's the
[1:37:28] abstract of Easter that the resurrected
[1:37:31] Jesus has sent back the abstract to
[1:37:34] guarantee us that we are already
[1:37:37] quickened with
[1:37:41] him and if they if I
[1:37:43] Rise they'll rise at that day you should
[1:37:46] know that I'm in the father and the
[1:37:48] father me and I in
[1:37:50] you but do you want to get up out of it
[1:37:56] I'm going to let a preacher loose here
[1:37:57] just for a minute do you really want to
[1:37:59] get up out of your problems or are you
[1:38:02] enjoying worshiping your
[1:38:05] situation are you satisfied with a
[1:38:08] halfway kind of
[1:38:10] Life I'll say this that he didn't just
[1:38:13] wave himself over you just to see that
[1:38:15] you could barely sprig up he waved
[1:38:18] himself over you to see you fully rise
[1:38:20] in resurrection power come on somebody
[1:38:24] because it's not just one thing if it's
[1:38:26] one thing if Jesus rise but what if he's
[1:38:28] waved over a congregation and they don't
[1:38:31] rise up to worship
[1:38:40] Him Full Gospel Lighthouse you're guilty
[1:38:44] if you miss the
[1:38:47] Rapture because you've had every
[1:38:49] opportunity you've had every chance of
[1:38:51] the word of God when William would stand
[1:38:54] there and he said I feel it in the room
[1:38:56] now when William Brandon would stand
[1:38:59] there and he said every generation has a
[1:39:01] fresh chance at the word of God and he
[1:39:04] has come here time and time again he has
[1:39:06] manifested his power he's manifested his
[1:39:09] truth we've handled him we've touched
[1:39:11] him we've felt him this Hallelujah this
[1:39:14] ain't a Jesus of 2,000 years ago only
[1:39:17] but he's right here and he's in the
[1:39:20] room and if he's in the room I'm going
[1:39:23] to worship ship him Simon s sirene of
[1:39:26] the Pharisees he may not worship him but
[1:39:29] while he's in the
[1:39:31] room I'm going to make sure that I got
[1:39:34] my ticket in
[1:39:37] hand hallu you're guilty for crucifying
[1:39:42] the word of God again you're guilty when
[1:39:45] he's waved himself over
[1:39:49] you
[1:39:50] hallelujah hallelujah when the word of
[1:39:54] God has waved over this generation not
[1:39:57] just in a preacher not just in a prophet
[1:39:59] but the very physical manifestation of
[1:40:02] the Holy Ghost has waved itself over
[1:40:04] this generation Le oosa is guilty for
[1:40:08] kicking Jesus
[1:40:12] out but I'm afraid there's too many leot
[1:40:15] of seeing so-called message people
[1:40:17] sitting in churches that are satisfied
[1:40:19] living in a
[1:40:21] grave that are satisfied living in
[1:40:23] habits that are satisfied living a
[1:40:25] halfway life they care more about their
[1:40:29] Sports than they care about
[1:40:32] [Applause]
[1:40:39] Easter they care more about the gods of
[1:40:42] Baal than they care about the God that's
[1:40:44] at The Showdown and will show
[1:40:46] up let me tell you the rest of them gods
[1:40:49] are still sitting in the grave now don't
[1:40:51] perk up on me and get all upset because
[1:40:53] cuz I talked about your Gods just for a
[1:40:54] minute but let me perk yourself up and
[1:40:57] tell you that there's power to get
[1:40:58] yourself out of them kind of graves if
[1:41:01] there wasn't power then I wouldn't
[1:41:03] preach it to you but because there is a
[1:41:05] power because there is a truth because
[1:41:07] there is a way because there is a life
[1:41:10] we have the abstract title deed of
[1:41:13] redemption that that quickening power
[1:41:16] has the
[1:41:18] [Applause]
[1:41:20] ability stuck in habits get up out of
[1:41:22] the grave stuck in Tomo get up out of
[1:41:25] the Grave you were not built for the
[1:41:28] grave you were built for the
[1:41:34] sky
[1:41:38] Hallelujah let me move on are y'all
[1:41:40] going to crucify me don't find no
[1:41:44] Nails what was it it was waved over the
[1:41:47] congregation how do you know it was
[1:41:48] waved over the congregation because when
[1:41:50] Peter was walking down an alley one day
[1:41:53] I probably didn't say that right walking
[1:41:55] down an alley walking down a street just
[1:41:57] his shadow cast over on a lady that was
[1:42:00] sitting there that was sick that had too
[1:42:03] going on but there's so much quickening
[1:42:05] power on the inside of Peter that just
[1:42:07] his shadow crossed over her he didn't
[1:42:09] touch her but the Hallelujah there was
[1:42:12] so much quickening power on the inside
[1:42:14] of Peter that when he walked
[1:42:17] by that she got up from her condition I
[1:42:20] don't care what condition that sh in I
[1:42:22] don't care what grave that you're in
[1:42:24] when Jesus walks by with an abstract
[1:42:28] it's a title deed you have every
[1:42:30] right it doesn't matter if your mom is a
[1:42:33] prostitute it doesn't matter if your
[1:42:34] dad's a boot ligger it doesn't matter
[1:42:36] where you are when the abstract Rolls by
[1:42:38] your
[1:42:40] way get ready to drop the
[1:42:42] needle get ready to drop the cigarettes
[1:42:45] get ready to drop the bottle I'm telling
[1:42:48] you right now he's in the room he's in
[1:42:51] the room let him pass by your way one
[1:42:53] time watch him watch him show
[1:42:56] up he'll roll the stone away he'll do
[1:43:00] the job he's still the same yesterday
[1:43:03] today and
[1:43:07] forever how many testimonies do I have
[1:43:09] in the room that is Easter it ain't just
[1:43:13] it ain't just a day but it's a life
[1:43:15] Easter doesn't just roll around once a
[1:43:19] year but Easter is every single day of
[1:43:21] our years
[1:43:24] [Applause]
[1:43:28] hallelujah what was it in this hour it
[1:43:32] was prophesied that it would wave over
[1:43:35] the congregation in Luke
[1:43:37] 17:30 Malachi 4 Revelations 10 what is
[1:43:42] it he was waved over in the son of man
[1:43:45] when it is the day when he's being
[1:43:47] revealed he was waved at the day of
[1:43:50] Pentecost and he was waved over this
[1:43:52] generation in this hour he was waved
[1:43:55] over the Pentecostal people that was up
[1:43:57] there waiting for the blessings to come
[1:44:00] but you don't have to wait for it no
[1:44:07] more
[1:44:09] Hallelujah they were waiting 10 days for
[1:44:11] it but that refreshing that came is here
[1:44:15] in the room that Pentecostal blessing is
[1:44:19] the confirmation of the Resurrection as
[1:44:22] Paul said in Ephesians 2 and 5 even when
[1:44:25] we were dead in sins hath he quickened
[1:44:27] us hath made us alive together with
[1:44:30] Christ by grace are you saved and ha
[1:44:33] raised us up together and made us to sit
[1:44:36] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:44:40] that's what William brandham said that
[1:44:41] the Pentecostal blessings is the
[1:44:44] confirmation of the Resurrection I love
[1:44:47] what the scripture says I love what it
[1:44:49] says in Ezekiel 37:12 we all look and we
[1:44:52] know we know what the first says the
[1:44:54] first part of it and we know how we how
[1:44:56] that the prophet stands there and the
[1:44:58] word of the Lord come unto him and said
[1:45:00] unto him do you see this valley of dry
[1:45:03] bones can they live again but notice
[1:45:06] what he says in verse 12 therefore
[1:45:08] prophesy and say unto them thus sayith
[1:45:11] the Lord God behold oh my people I will
[1:45:14] open your Graves and cause you to come
[1:45:17] out of your Graves and bring you into
[1:45:19] the land of Israel and you shall know
[1:45:22] that I am the Lord Lord when I have
[1:45:24] opened your Graves oh my people and
[1:45:27] brought you up out of your
[1:45:29] Graves I'm giving you every bit of
[1:45:31] scripture to get up out of it and shall
[1:45:33] put my spirit in you notice he was
[1:45:35] speaking to Israel the natural but it's
[1:45:38] a compound scripture it's also speaking
[1:45:41] to spiritual Israel and shall put my
[1:45:44] spirit in you and you shall live and I
[1:45:46] will place you in your
[1:45:50] position I will place you in the road of
[1:45:53] an adopted son I will place you I will
[1:45:57] place you as the wave sheath has waved
[1:45:59] up for you I will place you in your land
[1:46:02] and you shall know that I the Lord have
[1:46:05] spoken it and performed it and saith the
[1:46:10] Lord oh blessed be the name of the
[1:46:14] Lord what was it when a man could catch
[1:46:17] a vision of a boy that had been seen in
[1:46:20] a vision dead two years before before it
[1:46:23] ever happened but because it was Easter
[1:46:27] again when that boy died on that
[1:46:29] finished border and he's setting there
[1:46:31] and William brandham walks up to
[1:46:34] him he said oh that's a terrible sight
[1:46:36] but there the hand of the Lord put his
[1:46:38] hand upon him said look at it again
[1:46:41] because there was a vision of
[1:46:43] Resurrection there was a vision of
[1:46:45] Resurrection that was coming by that
[1:46:46] little boy's
[1:46:50] way it's powerful but ability Billy
[1:46:53] Graham would have prayed if Billy Graham
[1:46:54] would have been there that boy would
[1:46:56] have still been
[1:46:58] there because Billy Graham didn't have a
[1:47:00] vision of him if or Roberts would have
[1:47:02] been there that boy would have still
[1:47:04] been laying there because there was
[1:47:06] another man in the hour that had a
[1:47:08] vision of a boy getting up
[1:47:12] again oh come on somebody he said if
[1:47:16] that boy's not up off the ground in 5
[1:47:18] minutes you can call me a false prophet
[1:47:21] Hallelujah within a few moments had that
[1:47:24] boy's bone sticking out of his legs
[1:47:27] resurrection power rolled over top of
[1:47:30] him the same way that it rolled over top
[1:47:33] of the prodical son when he was down
[1:47:35] there living with the Hogs and he come
[1:47:37] to himself and said I will arise it's a
[1:47:40] resurrection time I will arise and go to
[1:47:44] my father's
[1:47:46] house prodal it's time to come to
[1:47:49] yourself it's time to have a
[1:47:51] resurrection
[1:47:55] and I ain't just talking about the
[1:47:56] prodigal out
[1:48:00] there here in the
[1:48:03] room here in the this is real this
[1:48:05] morning it's real this morning but
[1:48:08] you're going to come to yourself you've
[1:48:10] mocked it you've made fun of it and you
[1:48:12] set up the outside of the skirts just
[1:48:14] thinking I'm I'm
[1:48:16] not I'm not good enough to come back to
[1:48:18] the house of the Lord you don't
[1:48:20] backslide out there you backslide right
[1:48:26] here oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:48:30] but when he came to himself when he
[1:48:32] begin to remember who he was I've sat
[1:48:35] here I've sat in the presence of the
[1:48:37] Lord before I've sat there I've felt him
[1:48:40] I've known him but I'm so far out in my
[1:48:43] sin and my ideology that I can never
[1:48:45] come
[1:48:46] back but he came to
[1:48:51] himself when he come to to himself this
[1:48:54] is powerful when he come to himself his
[1:48:57] daddy had sat out there and he was
[1:49:00] watching for that boy he was waiting for
[1:49:03] that guy that had been there in
[1:49:04] spiritual Amnesia that who had forgotten
[1:49:07] who he was that forgot where he was he'd
[1:49:10] been Shell Shocked by leosia and he
[1:49:12] forgot who his daddy was but he started
[1:49:15] taking a walk and when he come across

[1:52:43] [Applause]
[1:52:47] Grave the devil picked out Al Capia for

[1:52:58] Little Drew Satan Satan tried to stop

[1:53:29] up with all kinds of
[1:53:31] dirt but the greater you bury yourself
[1:53:36] the greater your
[1:53:42] Resurrection
[1:53:45] hallelujah
[1:53:47] [Applause]
[1:53:51] hallelujah
[1:53:53] hallelujah what is it it's a voice in
[1:53:56] this
[1:53:57] generation it's a voice of resurrection
[1:54:00] and that voice is in the bride's body to
[1:54:03] cause that Resurrection for the Bible
[1:54:05] said in John 5:25 verily verily I say
[1:54:07] unto you that the hour is coming and now
[1:54:11] is when the dead shall hear the voice of
[1:54:14] the Son of God and they that hear it
[1:54:17] shall live verse 28 Marvel not at this
[1:54:20] for the hour is coming in which all that
[1:54:22] are in the graves shall hear his voice I
[1:54:26] don't have to remind you what Graves
[1:54:28] that you came out
[1:54:29] of but don't it feel good to be
[1:54:37] alive try to put Lazarus back in
[1:54:40] there he's too alive to put him back in
[1:54:44] there he's too alive to put him back in
[1:54:47] there and it's enough it ain't just
[1:54:50] enough for him to stand outside of your
[1:54:51] grave and said l come
[1:54:53] forth I think it's powerful brother Bram
[1:54:55] said he said now look he said if he
[1:54:57] wouldn't have called Lazarus by name it
[1:54:58] would cause the general Resurrection it
[1:55:00] shows you how much power is in this
[1:55:02] voice that they that are dead and are in
[1:55:04] the graves shall come forth it ain't
[1:55:07] just enough to get up out of the Grave
[1:55:09] you got to unloose
[1:55:12] yourself that's what Jesus stood there
[1:55:14] and he said the same word in Matthew
[1:55:17] 24:35 that heaven and earth will pass
[1:55:19] away but my word will never pass away he
[1:55:22] used the same word when he was speaking
[1:55:24] about go there and you'll find a coat
[1:55:27] the the coat the fo of an ass said loose
[1:55:30] him for the master has need of him and
[1:55:33] he stands there you can hear in future
[1:55:35] home and he stands there and uses the
[1:55:37] same word when he's standing there at
[1:55:40] the grave of Lazarus and he said loose
[1:55:43] him loose him loose him and let him go
[1:55:48] come on somebody loose your feet loose
[1:55:51] your hands loose loose your mouth loose
[1:55:53] your joy loose your praise loose
[1:55:57] yourself because if the head got up out
[1:55:59] of the Grave then the body's got to get
[1:56:01] up out of the grave as
[1:56:09] well Easter proved that he wasn't just
[1:56:12] mechanics but he was the Dynamics of it
[1:56:15] as well that it wasn't just gasoline but
[1:56:18] it was spark there that's what Paul said
[1:56:20] in 1 Thessalonians 1:5
[1:56:22] that the word came not unto you only in
[1:56:25] word only but in power and in
[1:56:28] demonstration brother bandam said he
[1:56:30] said it didn't come to you in gasoline
[1:56:32] only but it came to you also in spark
[1:56:35] that which you have received is the very
[1:56:38] Dynamic power to get you up out of the
[1:56:41] Grave that's why when Jesus is standing
[1:56:45] there in Luke 10 and 19 he said behold I
[1:56:48] give you power to tread upon serpents
[1:56:51] and to cast down Devils what is it
[1:56:54] William brandham is standing there and
[1:56:56] the resurrection and the resurrection
[1:56:59] servant and he's saying it is the rising
[1:57:01] of the sun he said there's been churches
[1:57:03] churches Brides brides but there's got
[1:57:06] to come one that's both mechanics and
[1:57:10] Dynamics well glory be to God I want to
[1:57:13] announce to you that you have arrived
[1:57:16] and you are that
[1:57:21] bride

[1:58:21] power

[1:58:26] homely thing it's got a hair on its
[1:58:29] chest got hair on its dress and sounds
[1:58:31] like a a mountain line when it screams

[2:01:54] tells him he said he said it's a sign of

[2:02:20] faster than we do and that realm they
[2:02:23] understand who you are in that realm
[2:02:26] they see you where you are they have
[2:02:28] already been caught up but one of these
[2:02:31] mornings we're going to catch up we're
