[49:47] all the odds that were against us and
[49:49] stacked up
[49:51] higher than we could ever get over well
[49:54] you came and you
[49:55] you broke those things down father and
[49:58] we might come running
[50:00] completely to you into the arms of mercy
[50:04] we have ran father that anointing we
[50:07] feel
[50:09] at this pulpit and even those in the
[50:11] back
[50:12] lord we we know that that anointing
[50:15] is the supreme power of god and it's
[50:18] come
[50:19] to control this service and to speak
[50:22] lift to ear to
[50:24] your children to sustain them and give
[50:27] them a word in due season
[50:29] and i would ask father that every need
[50:31] that is amongst us
[50:33] lord i pray that your power your
[50:35] anointing
[50:36] lord would strike that need and curse
[50:40] the enemy out of their life
[50:42] father i know that there's needs that
[50:44] are very heavy
[50:47] very heavy amongst us very burdensome
[50:50] father
[50:51] but we've come here tonight with the
[50:53] burden of the word of the lord
[50:55] to carry these things father and i
[50:58] believe that the spirit of the lord is
[50:59] anointed me
[51:01] to preach this gospel lord i pray that
[51:04] you would set the captive free
[51:07] lord i pray that you would turn their
[51:10] ashes into beauty
[51:11] father and may they take off the garment
[51:14] of heaviness and put on the garment of
[51:16] praise
[51:17] i pray father for
[51:21] the pruitt family just now we pray that
[51:24] you would be seen lord amongst them for
[51:27] sister karen we know that the bride
[51:29] around the world is gathering and
[51:31] uniting their faith together to strike
[51:33] this enemy
[51:35] that has struck down the daughter of god
[51:38] father i pray that you would send a word
[51:41] by their way you confirmed that you
[51:44] would come down
[51:46] from your glory to minister to this need
[51:49] father i pray that you would show up
[51:53] you sent your word and you healed them
[51:55] one more time lord
[51:57] when you take this service
[52:00] may be edification to the body of jesus
[52:03] christ
[52:04] in the name of jesus and the bride says
[52:08] amen amen if you have your bibles this
[52:10] evening we'd like to look over in the
[52:11] book of
[52:12] romans book of romans chapter 12
[52:17] and verse 1 and then also ephesians
[52:19] chapter 2
[52:22] and verse 10.
[52:29] and i would like to continue on our
[52:31] thought from last weekend on
[52:32] breaking down barriers
[52:43] we've seen jesus really close
[52:47] in our walks of life we have seen him
[52:50] and handled him and felt him
[52:53] and we've seen him amongst our own
[52:55] families amongst our church family right
[52:57] here
[52:57] how he has come in and he's broke down
[53:00] some things
[53:01] he's broke down barriers and we just
[53:04] want to
[53:06] allow him to come in this evening and
[53:08] speak to our hearts and
[53:10] the sermon that i'll preach here i want
[53:13] to be very strategic in laying out the
[53:15] scriptures
[53:16] and if you have your bibles and your
[53:17] notes to kind of stay with or write down
[53:20] and i'll try not to go too fast to
[53:23] and depending on how how you pull will
[53:26] make me
[53:26] come out of my lane maybe
[53:29] but but this sermon is not indicated for
[53:33] one person
[53:34] particularly but it's to all and it's to
[53:37] christians
[53:38] of five months old to 30 years old
[53:42] and it's covering all all things
[53:46] i think the scriptures are very uh
[53:49] very clear that that even though we have
[53:52] walked with christ for some time i
[53:54] believe that there are still things
[53:56] in our christian life that we have to
[53:59] let go of
[54:00] and we have to learn to walk of jesus
[54:04] i i don't i don't mean i don't mean to
[54:07] point any fingers or anything like that
[54:10] but i i got noticed today
[54:12] from heaven that it's open season on
[54:14] devils
[54:17] yeah and i'm on a hunt yeah
[54:20] romans chapter 12 and verse one i i
[54:23] beseech you
[54:24] therefore brethren by the mercies of god
[54:27] that you present
[54:28] your bodies a living sacrifice
[54:31] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[54:34] reasonable service
[54:36] and be not conformed to this world but
[54:38] be ye transformed by the renewing of
[54:40] your mind
[54:41] that you may prove what is that good and
[54:44] acceptable
[54:46] and perfect will of god ephesians
[54:49] chapter 2 and verse 10. the bible says
[54:52] here that
[54:53] that we are his workmanship
[54:56] created in christ jesus unto good works
[55:00] which god hath before ordained that we
[55:03] should
[55:04] walk in them wherefore remember that ye
[55:07] being in times past gentiles in the
[55:10] flesh who are called uncircumcision by
[55:13] that which is called
[55:14] the circumcision in the flesh made by
[55:16] hands
[55:17] that at that time you were without
[55:19] christ being aliens
[55:21] from the commonwealth of israel and
[55:23] strangers
[55:24] from the covenants of promise having no
[55:27] hope and without god in the world
[55:29] but now in christ jesus ye who
[55:32] sometimes were afar off are made nigh
[55:35] by the blood of christ for he is our
[55:38] peace
[55:39] who hath made both one and hath broken
[55:42] down
[55:42] the middle wall of petition between us
[55:46] may god bless his word you may be seated
[55:48] this evening
[55:49] in the presence of the lord
[55:53] i believe that that we were born
[55:56] into this world that we live in for a
[55:58] purpose
[55:59] and i believe that god has so fitly
[56:02] designed each and every one of us for
[56:04] his purpose
[56:05] as david would say in the psalm book of
[56:08] one psalm
[56:09] 139 that i will praise thee for i am
[56:12] fearfully
[56:13] and wonderfully made and marvelous are
[56:16] thy works that my
[56:17] soul might know right well and i believe
[56:21] that our purpose
[56:22] is is something that cannot be thwarted
[56:24] and it cannot be stopped
[56:26] but i don't believe that our purpose
[56:28] isn't set and designed to be someone
[56:31] in society or some goal that is set in
[56:34] front of us
[56:35] as children or as parents to be
[56:37] something or to make something out of
[56:39] our lives
[56:40] but i believe just like jesus was
[56:42] speaking with john when he come down to
[56:45] the jordan
[56:46] river and it come his time and he walked
[56:49] down to the water to be baptized and he
[56:51] had a conversation with john and john
[56:53] had a conversation with him
[56:55] and he made these remarks john did say
[56:57] and he said i said
[56:59] i have need to be baptized of thee but
[57:02] jesus
[57:02] made these words said these words
[57:05] suffered to be
[57:06] so for thus it becometh us to fulfill
[57:10] all righteousness and i believe that it
[57:12] is our purpose
[57:13] to fulfill all righteousness and to
[57:16] fulfill
[57:16] all the promises of god that are laying
[57:19] there
[57:20] in front of us and i believe that there
[57:22] are there are
[57:23] there are promises that are
[57:25] strategically placed
[57:27] and and the light of the word is shined
[57:29] upon at a certain season
[57:31] to break the barriers off of our life
[57:33] and i believe that there are blessings
[57:36] in front of us that are to be attained
[57:38] strictly
[57:39] for the victory of the lord i believe
[57:42] that goodness and mercy will follow us
[57:44] all the days of our lives and we will
[57:47] dwell
[57:48] in the house of the lord forever and i
[57:51] believe that that there is a purpose of
[57:53] god
[57:54] that that the enemy is trying to trying
[57:56] to stamp out and trying to
[57:59] stop out our influence or stomp out our
[58:01] fire or stamp out our
[58:03] our experience but be we notice that
[58:06] satan
[58:07] he knows that he cannot stop the plan of
[58:10] god
[58:10] but he has always tried to he's always
[58:13] tried to
[58:14] set up his own kingdom in the north side
[58:16] and he's always tried his very best and
[58:19] he took a third of the angels
[58:21] but that didn't surprise god that didn't
[58:23] that didn't
[58:24] shake god off of his plan god had a plan
[58:27] and the bible is very clear to us that
[58:29] god has a plan for our future
[58:32] i i want to say that there is no
[58:34] sickness there is no
[58:36] there is nothing that can hinder a child
[58:39] of god that is going to meet the
[58:41] promises of god
[58:42] when they know that they are in the plan
[58:45] but
[58:46] satan will stand there and try to hinder
[58:48] the move of god
[58:49] he'll try to hinder the children of god
[58:52] by doing that by making them sick or
[58:54] making them afflicted or oppressed and
[58:57] make them feel abandoned make them
[58:59] feel like they're on an island all by
[59:00] themselves or make them feel like
[59:02] they're
[59:03] they're confused or frustrated or
[59:05] unwanted you see he cannot and he knows
[59:08] that he cannot stop the plan of god
[59:10] so he brings in barriers and he builds
[59:13] up walls
[59:14] made out of lies that are weaker than
[59:15] the broth made out of a shadow of a
[59:17] chicken that starved to death
[59:19] because his tactics and warfare that he
[59:22] comes against us with
[59:23] will never whip the word of god so he
[59:26] comes against us with lies
[59:28] lies and threatenings and satan knows
[59:31] that he ain't nothing but
[59:32] a little little kitty cat but he he
[59:34] tries to present himself as
[59:35] a roaring lion the bible says as a
[59:38] roaring lion
[59:39] walking about seeking whom he may devour
[59:42] and he sounds out his threatenings
[59:44] against the children of god
[59:46] to cause fear and to make them back away
[59:48] from the word and believe a lie
[59:50] and down their soul because they believe
[59:52] and not the truth
[59:54] that's his purpose is to turn us away
[59:56] from the promises of god
[59:58] but we have our promise we have our
[1:00:01] purpose
[1:00:01] we have our agenda satan is trying his
[1:00:04] very best to
[1:00:05] stuff his agenda down our throat but we
[1:00:07] have our agenda
[1:00:08] to step back down in his throat and say
[1:00:11] we will not
[1:00:12] take what you push on us we will not
[1:00:14] take what you throw at us
[1:00:16] we will hold up the shield of faith and
[1:00:18] it will quench the fiery darks of the
[1:00:20] enemy
[1:00:21] that he sins of unbelief and tactics of
[1:00:24] warfare
[1:00:25] but our god is a consuming fire
[1:00:30] hallelujah now a barrier as we know and
[1:00:33] went over a few things last week in a
[1:00:35] barrier
[1:00:36] is a fence or an uh or another obstacle
[1:00:38] that is there to prevent
[1:00:40] movement or access a barrier is a
[1:00:43] fortification
[1:00:44] offense to stop an enemy and satan
[1:00:47] is the enemy of god a barrier is a wall
[1:00:51] for a defense a a barrier is a fortress
[1:00:54] it's an obstruction of anything which
[1:00:57] confines
[1:00:58] or which hinders the approach or the
[1:01:00] attack
[1:01:01] and satan has done his very best and he
[1:01:04] is the very best at sending out smoke
[1:01:06] screens and
[1:01:07] setting up illusions and trying to find
[1:01:10] the children of god
[1:01:12] trying to say that this is the way that
[1:01:13] they're going to be
[1:01:15] this is the way your future is going to
[1:01:16] come out but i
[1:01:18] heard a prophet say when he was dealing
[1:01:20] with that amoeba attack when he when he
[1:01:23] when he had
[1:01:24] got talked into doing something and he
[1:01:26] disobeyed god
[1:01:27] there he was in his room and he was
[1:01:30] wondering about his
[1:01:31] future wondering if he'd always deal
[1:01:33] with these things
[1:01:34] wondering if he'd always handle that in
[1:01:36] the back of his mind
[1:01:37] and there the angel of the lord stepped
[1:01:39] into the room
[1:01:40] and took up papers that he had sitting
[1:01:43] beside his bed
[1:01:44] and he took those crumpled up pieces of
[1:01:46] paper and he stretched them all the way
[1:01:48] up to glory
[1:01:49] and the angel of the lord said your
[1:01:51] future is clear
[1:01:53] and satan can try to confine you by his
[1:01:56] lies
[1:01:56] by his tactics but there is a word of
[1:01:59] promise that's come by the children of
[1:02:01] god's way
[1:02:02] that your future is clear your future is
[1:02:04] not
[1:02:05] down to hell your future is a rapture
[1:02:08] your future is a body change
[1:02:10] your future is it to be in heaven with
[1:02:12] god almighty
[1:02:13] your future is not destruction your
[1:02:16] future is victory
[1:02:18] your future is not sickness your future
[1:02:20] is healing
[1:02:21] your future is not to be defeated but to
[1:02:24] be
[1:02:25] undefeated your future is not to be
[1:02:27] conquered
[1:02:28] but to be unconquered your future is in
[1:02:31] the hands of god
[1:02:33] and what god is holding no man can pluck
[1:02:36] out
[1:02:37] look up or pour or care about
[1:02:42] hallelujah
[1:02:43] [Applause]
[1:02:46] hallelujah and the prophet would say to
[1:02:48] us don't you fear to go anywhere
[1:02:50] or to do anything for the never failing
[1:02:52] presence of jesus christ
[1:02:54] is with you always hallelujah
[1:02:59] now we know what satan's weapon is
[1:03:01] against us when brother branham would
[1:03:02] preach the
[1:03:03] the greatest battle ever fought one of
[1:03:05] the greatest sermons i believe that
[1:03:07] that the prophet would speak if you
[1:03:08] haven't listened to it in a long time
[1:03:10] i believe you ought to revisit it but he
[1:03:12] said now he said what is satan's weapon
[1:03:14] against you
[1:03:15] it's to try to get you to disbelieve
[1:03:17] your weapon
[1:03:18] he disarmed you he said let's listen
[1:03:20] real close quite quiet now
[1:03:22] he said listen if he can if he can get
[1:03:24] you to disbelieve your weapon is
[1:03:25] ever equivalent if he can get you to
[1:03:28] believe that your weapon
[1:03:30] is not strong enough he has you disarmed
[1:03:33] he said oh brother never i hope we we
[1:03:35] never leave that
[1:03:36] he said look he's disarmed you when he
[1:03:39] gets you
[1:03:40] to disbelieve that weapon and he said
[1:03:42] when you lay that down
[1:03:44] that finishes your fight and you're done
[1:03:46] but he said
[1:03:47] hold that weapon brother said hold that
[1:03:50] weapon your prophet said
[1:03:52] don't lay it down he said we see his
[1:03:54] unbelief
[1:03:56] we see his unbelief what does he do he
[1:03:58] sends in
[1:03:59] he sends in reasoning he sends in
[1:04:01] sickness he sends in superstitions
[1:04:04] he sends in demonic powers but there is
[1:04:07] not enough power
[1:04:08] in all of hell that can ever defeat the
[1:04:10] purpose of god
[1:04:12] because god will bring it to pass he
[1:04:14] will bring his children to maturity
[1:04:17] there's no premature grave that you are
[1:04:20] going to
[1:04:20] because there ain't no grave going to
[1:04:22] hold the body of jesus christ down
[1:04:25] god has commissioned that we will be
[1:04:28] there
[1:04:29] on resurrection morning we're not going
[1:04:31] by the way of the grave
[1:04:32] we're going by the way of the rapture
[1:04:36] jacob can send out all he wants to
[1:04:39] against us
[1:04:40] but to say the psalm said in psalms 124
[1:04:43] if it had not been the lord who was on
[1:04:46] our side
[1:04:47] now may israel say it if it had not been
[1:04:50] the lord who was on our side
[1:04:51] when men rose up against us then had
[1:04:54] they swallowed us
[1:04:55] up quick when their wrath was kindled
[1:04:57] against us
[1:04:58] then the waters had overwhelmed us the
[1:05:01] stream had gone over us whole
[1:05:03] them proud proud waters had gone over us
[1:05:06] whole
[1:05:06] but blessed be the lord who hath not
[1:05:09] given us over
[1:05:10] to the prey to due to that to not given
[1:05:14] us
[1:05:14] uh given us as a prey to their teeth
[1:05:17] sorry i had my
[1:05:18] had my tongue wrapped around my eye
[1:05:19] tooth i couldn't see what i was saying
[1:05:21] he said but blessed be the lord who have
[1:05:23] not given us
[1:05:25] as a prey to their teeth our soul is
[1:05:28] escaped
[1:05:29] as a bird out of the snare of the
[1:05:31] phallus the snare is broken
[1:05:33] and we are escaped our help is in the
[1:05:36] name of the lord
[1:05:38] who made heaven and earth
[1:05:41] hallelujah that is our help when
[1:05:43] sickness comes
[1:05:44] that is our help when cancer comes that
[1:05:47] is our help when brain bleeds come
[1:05:49] that is our help the name of the lord is
[1:05:51] a strong
[1:05:52] tower and the righteous run into it and
[1:05:55] they are safe
[1:05:59] hallelujah
[1:06:02] oh give the lord a hand clap a praise
[1:06:08] our help is in the name of the lord he
[1:06:11] didn't give you over to be
[1:06:12] prayed to a wannabe line he didn't give
[1:06:14] you over to a reprobate mind
[1:06:16] he didn't give you up when satan wanted
[1:06:18] you and brother branham said in a future
[1:06:20] home
[1:06:21] he said actually god took you away from
[1:06:24] satan
[1:06:24] when he was referring to the woman at
[1:06:26] the well he said satan wanted her
[1:06:29] but god took her away from him he didn't
[1:06:32] give you over the cursings
[1:06:33] he gave you blessings he didn't give you
[1:06:36] sickness
[1:06:36] god gave you healings he didn't give you
[1:06:38] problems he gave you promises
[1:06:41] he didn't make you defeated he made you
[1:06:43] undefeated
[1:06:44] god is the author of life and he is not
[1:06:46] the author of confusion
[1:06:48] you were not born to be defeated you
[1:06:51] were born
[1:06:52] and designed by the author of life
[1:06:55] you are fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:06:58] and satan cannot touch you or harm you
[1:07:01] unless he gets permission from my father
[1:07:06] god is a god that builds kingdoms god is
[1:07:09] a god that builds life
[1:07:11] and creates life he's the one that built
[1:07:14] you and made you the way that you are
[1:07:16] and your purpose is not finished yet
[1:07:18] slap your neighbor don't slap him in the
[1:07:20] face slap him on the shoulder
[1:07:22] say your purpose ain't finished yet he
[1:07:24] made us the way that we
[1:07:26] are but he does not make us make the
[1:07:30] choices
[1:07:31] he did not push us through a pipe and
[1:07:33] say blessed is he that overcometh
[1:07:38] he didn't he didn't get you in that mess
[1:07:40] you got yourself in that mess
[1:07:42] he didn't drag you down in that alley
[1:07:44] you drug yourself down in their alley
[1:07:47] but he is a faithful god to get us out
[1:07:49] of that alley
[1:07:51] he's a faithful god to snatch us out of
[1:07:53] the

[1:08:27] other disciples that have been locked up
[1:08:29] there for preaching this word
[1:08:31] this same message they got locked up in

[1:08:34] but the lord that the word said in acts
[1:08:36] chapter 5 and 19 that the angel of the
[1:08:39] lord

[1:08:42] up the door

[1:08:46] out there
[1:08:46] and took him into a place he said go
[1:08:49] stand
[1:08:50] and declare this word of life unto all
[1:08:53] of them in the temple
[1:08:56] when he brings you out he's not just
[1:08:58] setting you free
[1:08:59] so that you can fall back in sin he's
[1:09:02] bringing you
[1:09:03] out to break the barriers off of sin to
[1:09:05] break the chains off the
[1:09:07] off of the things of life

[1:09:15] and satan is trying to stop this move
[1:09:18] he's trying to put up barriers to stop
[1:09:20] god
[1:09:21] and he's trying to bring in squatters on
[1:09:23] your promises
[1:09:26] and so that was for a day gone by but

[1:09:49] might as well back away from it
[1:09:51] there's a law here that says you are
[1:09:53] condemned

[1:11:23] or throughout your environment that you
[1:11:25] pick up that you can't just
[1:11:27] you can't just get rid of on your own
[1:11:32] you watch you you see people and you can
[1:11:35] even watch when somebody's adopted into
[1:11:37] a family
[1:11:38] and they can be treated like a child and
[1:11:41] the father can love him like a child
[1:11:43] and a child can love him like a father
[1:11:45] but yet there are things that you know
[1:11:47] could not be passed down
[1:11:49] because the dna is not there but yet
[1:11:52] because
[1:11:53] of the environment that he's in he's
[1:11:55] influenced by that environment
[1:11:58] and he picks up little things that's why
[1:12:01] i
[1:12:01] i believe that that if the atmosphere is
[1:12:04] right you'll pick up some things
[1:12:07] you'll pick up that these promises are
[1:12:09] not for days gone by
[1:12:10] you'll pick up that that malachi 4 ain't
[1:12:13] just got william branham in there but
[1:12:14] it's got you in there
[1:12:16] are you with me you'll pick up that over
[1:12:18] in revelations 10
[1:12:19] that it wasn't just a mighty angel and
[1:12:21] it wasn't just brother branham there
[1:12:23] the seventh angel but you'll pick out to
[1:12:25] say hey there's somebody
[1:12:27] there's somebody that's got to prophesy
[1:12:30] and speak these things again
[1:12:32] hallelujah you'll pick up these things
[1:12:34] that greater is he that is in me
[1:12:36] than he that's in the world oh you might
[1:12:39] be in the environment and you watch some
[1:12:41] people
[1:12:42] they get in the atmosphere or get under
[1:12:44] the environment
[1:12:45] and man they can quote some scriptures
[1:12:47] man they can sure
[1:12:48] walk the walk it looks like and talk the
[1:12:50] talk but yet they can go out and get
[1:12:52] tempted and fall away
[1:12:54] because it's not something that's locked
[1:12:56] up in the dna
[1:12:58] it's just environment
[1:13:08] there's things that are passed down
[1:13:10] cycles and barriers that are built up
[1:13:12] through humanity that
[1:13:14] that that there is only a blood that can
[1:13:16] conquer
[1:13:18] are you with me and that's why paul
[1:13:21] would say
[1:13:22] he would sit there and he said i will
[1:13:24] beseech you brethren
[1:13:26] that you present your bodies a living
[1:13:28] sacrifice
[1:13:29] that you would be transformed by the
[1:13:31] renewing
[1:13:33] of your mind now look i want you to look
[1:13:36] at this
[1:13:36] you can change your hairstyle you can
[1:13:39] change
[1:13:39] your dress you can change your speech
[1:13:42] but it does not change
[1:13:44] your heart are you with me you you you
[1:13:47] can change
[1:13:48] you can change your makeup you can
[1:13:50] change the way you
[1:13:51] sing you can change the way you come to
[1:13:54] church
[1:13:55] but if you do not have a changed mind
[1:13:57] you will never break down any barriers
[1:14:00] just because you change something on the
[1:14:03] outside
[1:14:04] but if there is a change in your mind
[1:14:07] you can stand there like paul said
[1:14:09] that i am persuaded that neither death
[1:14:12] nor life nor angels no principalities
[1:14:16] no things to come nor anything coming or
[1:14:19] going
[1:14:19] shall be able to separate me from the
[1:14:22] love of god
[1:14:24] i'd say that you can walk through
[1:14:26] sickness you can walk through temptation
[1:14:28] you can walk through pain if you've got
[1:14:30] a changed mind
[1:14:32] and a changed heart
[1:14:40] but it's got to be a breaking
[1:14:44] you see why he is so good at redemption
[1:14:47] and restoration
[1:14:48] is because the people that come to him
[1:14:51] are broken
[1:14:52] [Music]
[1:14:55] there are things laying there that you
[1:14:57] cannot personally
[1:14:59] overcome amen but there's a god that's
[1:15:03] here
[1:15:04] that can pick you up out of the mirror
[1:15:06] clay and set your foot on a rock
[1:15:08] to stay you remember you know that you
[1:15:12] say well i i can overcome i can overcome
[1:15:15] let me tell you
[1:15:16] you you look over in the scriptures and
[1:15:18] i'm not preaching to you anything that's
[1:15:19] outside the scriptures that
[1:15:20] is laying right there in the book of
[1:15:21] genesis about cycles and barriers
[1:15:24] when you look over there at abraham and
[1:15:26] he goes down there and brother branham
[1:15:28] tells us in the opening of the seven
[1:15:29] seals
[1:15:30] that god changed them after the meeting
[1:15:33] of melchizedek
[1:15:34] he changed abraham and sarah but watch
[1:15:36] what abraham did he walked down there to
[1:15:38] gorier
[1:15:39] and he told sarah sarah now look if
[1:15:41] anybody asks you who you are you just
[1:15:43] tell them
[1:15:44] that i that you're my sister now notice
[1:15:47] what he did
[1:15:48] and forgive me but let me tell you when
[1:15:51] god does something he does something
[1:15:53] good
[1:15:54] he here and people think that this was
[1:15:56] some 90 year old woman
[1:15:58] they ain't no 90 year old woman so fine
[1:16:00] that a king will look
[1:16:01] lust after but here god comes in
[1:16:05] by by the way of melchizedek and changes
[1:16:08] their body
[1:16:10] that she's not walking down there as
[1:16:12] some stupid shoulder 90 year old woman
[1:16:14] and i'm not
[1:16:14] i'm not disregarding somebody but let me
[1:16:17] tell you at 90 years old i highly doubt
[1:16:19] anybody's going to be lusting
[1:16:20] after me
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:26] i hear you i hear you but you notice
[1:16:30] now look here's the cycle it's going
[1:16:32] forward
[1:16:33] he's done told this thing and if it had
[1:16:36] not been
[1:16:37] for the lord coming in there and he told
[1:16:39] him
[1:16:40] he told the king in the night season he
[1:16:42] said restore the man his wife
[1:16:45] but look here it is you can flip past
[1:16:48] some few chapters here and look over in
[1:16:50] genesis chapter 26
[1:16:52] when isaac goes down there with rebecca
[1:16:55] and he sets up his tent outside of
[1:16:56] gorier
[1:16:57] and he said and said and he did the same
[1:17:00] exact thing in the same exact place
[1:17:04] rebecca if anybody asked you
[1:17:08] you tell them that you're my sister the
[1:17:12] bible said that she was
[1:17:13] fair to look upon but because
[1:17:17] there was no blood that could take away
[1:17:20] their sin it only covered sin you see
[1:17:23] that cycle
[1:17:24] or that barrier could not be broken
[1:17:29] you can go down to david king david that
[1:17:31] little weakness that he had in his life
[1:17:34] it's passed down to his sons you
[1:17:36] remember when david's out there
[1:17:38] had a problem when there was a there was
[1:17:40] a warrior or a captain there was a
[1:17:41] captain's wife that was sitting over
[1:17:43] there
[1:17:44] taking a bath and he and he brought her
[1:17:46] unto himself
[1:17:47] you can watch his son ammon and how he
[1:17:49] takes his sister
[1:17:51] and he commits an act with her then you
[1:17:53] can look at david
[1:17:54] at david you could see that david had a
[1:17:57] problem
[1:17:58] he had a real problem at the death of
[1:18:00] david
[1:18:01] they brought a virgin unto him and put
[1:18:03] him in the bed with david
[1:18:04] and david he did not even move and they
[1:18:07] said hey
[1:18:07] the king is dead they knew that if he
[1:18:10] didn't resurrect for that there was
[1:18:12] something going on he didn't break a
[1:18:14] barrier
[1:18:14] he was just about to die but you can
[1:18:16] watch that david the bible said that
[1:18:18] david had
[1:18:19] 500 women in his life you can look at
[1:18:21] solomon it didn't get broke
[1:18:24] solomon is known for having over a
[1:18:27] thousand
[1:18:27] a thousand women in his life because a
[1:18:31] cycle could not be broken
[1:18:35] but paul said nor height nor death
[1:18:39] nor any other creature shall be able to
[1:18:41] separate me
[1:18:43] from the love of god if you look at that
[1:18:46] word in the greek
[1:18:47] high thing it is it is hoopsma
[1:18:51] it is a high thing or an elevated thing
[1:18:53] that is an elevated structure
[1:18:55] that is a barrier a rampart or a bulwark
[1:19:00] and you can see when paul goes over in
[1:19:02] second corinthians and he told us in
[1:19:04] verse five to cast
[1:19:05] down imaginations and every barrier
[1:19:09] that exalteth itself against the
[1:19:12] knowledge of god
[1:19:13] into captivity and every thought to the
[1:19:16] obedience
[1:19:17] of christ
[1:19:20] you see that's what the enemy loves to
[1:19:22] do is to bring in barriers
[1:19:24] to keep us away from the promises
[1:19:28] to rob us build up cycles in our life
[1:19:33] we'll never overcome that this is about
[1:19:37] breaking those things
[1:19:40] now you i want you to know the only way
[1:19:42] you're going to overcome
[1:19:44] is by the word of the lord amen
[1:19:48] and by the blood of the lamb and the
[1:19:51] prophet said that you can take
[1:19:53] god at his word and you can shake every
[1:19:56] devil away from you and you can run free
[1:20:01] shake it off shake it off and step up
[1:20:06] you remember when jerry cloud told that
[1:20:08] story about that about that mule falling
[1:20:10] down in that hole down there
[1:20:12] he he told about that he said that
[1:20:14] farmer he lost he looked all over
[1:20:15] for that mule and he looked all over his
[1:20:18] land but he couldn't find him but he
[1:20:19] went over there and he looked in his
[1:20:20] well
[1:20:21] and he found that that mule had been
[1:20:23] falling down in there he saw oh man
[1:20:25] he said i'll never get him out of there
[1:20:27] i never get him out of there he sits
[1:20:28] away he said well
[1:20:29] i'll just bury him i'll just bury him
[1:20:31] down there so he started throwing dirt
[1:20:33] over on him
[1:20:33] and that every time every time that dirt
[1:20:36] would hit that mule
[1:20:37] he would just shake it off he'd shake it
[1:20:40] off and finally there got enough dirt
[1:20:42] underneath of him he started stepping up
[1:20:44] and he said well that farmer said hey
[1:20:45] i'm not burying that thing that thing's
[1:20:47] getting higher
[1:20:47] so he realized what was going on so we
[1:20:49] got a party that came over
[1:20:51] and he started throwing dirt and every
[1:20:53] time that mule
[1:20:54] he would throw dirt down on him he would
[1:20:56] shake it off and he would step
[1:20:57] up and every time the word comes by your
[1:21:01] way
[1:21:01] and the enemy is coming by to throw up
[1:21:04] dirt in your life
[1:21:05] but i want to tell you to shake it off
[1:21:07] and step up
[1:21:09] step up to where the promises of god
[1:21:11] will bring you
[1:21:12] out of the pit the bible said that he
[1:21:14] has enlarged my feet
[1:21:16] that i may not fall oh
[1:21:19] hallelujah there's a god that is on your
[1:21:22] side
[1:21:24] [Applause]
[1:21:26] mother branham said and letting off the
[1:21:27] pressure he said he said i got to nail
[1:21:29] it down
[1:21:29] or satan's going to rob it from you he
[1:21:31] said from this great display of the
[1:21:33] presence of the holy ghost here tonight
[1:21:35] he said beyond the shadow of doubt the
[1:21:38] bible evidence what god said would take
[1:21:40] place
[1:21:40] now notice i believe this is going to
[1:21:43] happen right here for you tonight
[1:21:45] he said there's a mighty russian wind
[1:21:48] trying to get into the audience
[1:21:50] and to fill every soul with the presence
[1:21:53] of god
[1:21:54] don't let satan take it away from you
[1:21:56] hold on to it
[1:21:57] till you pass the barriers of unbelief
[1:22:02] hold on to it there's a rushing mighty
[1:22:04] wind
[1:22:05] that's trying to get on the inside of
[1:22:07] your soul and satan can come to your
[1:22:10] mind
[1:22:10] and tell you different things that
[1:22:12] you're done in your past
[1:22:14] but speak like the prophet spoke and say
[1:22:16] house of hell
[1:22:17] give way in the name of jesus christ
[1:22:21] let there be a rattling and a shaking
[1:22:24] and come out of the cage
[1:22:26] that the enemy puts you in
[1:22:31] he is standing here in the form of the
[1:22:34] holy spirit
[1:22:35] to tell you that he's a mighty cop crap
[1:22:40] he has broke through every every
[1:22:43] every barrier now notice
[1:22:46] in the mighty god unveiled he said he's
[1:22:49] broken
[1:22:50] every denominational veil every sound
[1:22:53] barrier
[1:22:54] that sound that says all that's
[1:22:56] fanaticism he broke right through that
[1:22:58] thing
[1:22:58] the sound that said come out of there
[1:23:00] said all them them people are crazy
[1:23:03] he broke right through that veil yes he
[1:23:05] did oh you can't do it
[1:23:06] you're nothing but a bunch of fanatics
[1:23:08] he broke right through that
[1:23:10] there's no such thing as divine healing
[1:23:12] he broke right through that
[1:23:14] my for his word said he would and you
[1:23:17] can't conquer the word of god
[1:23:19] and there he stands yet tonight the
[1:23:20] mighty conqueror since he broke every
[1:23:23] methodist and baptist and presbyterian
[1:23:25] in every kind of a veil he still stands
[1:23:28] amongst his people tonight
[1:23:29] unconquered by traditions let people say
[1:23:32] what they want
[1:23:33] want to do what they want to do anything
[1:23:36] they want to
[1:23:37] god comes breaking right through that
[1:23:39] sound barrier
[1:23:40] and remember they tell me when a plane
[1:23:42] breaks that sound barrier
[1:23:44] there's no limit to it speed he said i'm
[1:23:46] telling you within when you break that
[1:23:48] traditional barrier
[1:23:49] that jesus is way back and he isn't now
[1:23:52] when you find that he's the same
[1:23:53] yesterday
[1:23:54] today and forever there's no limit to
[1:23:57] what god could do
[1:23:58] right here in this convention and show
[1:24:00] this world what they need
[1:24:02] not a world's fair but a world revival
[1:24:05] that'll be
[1:24:05] filled and baptized with the presence of
[1:24:08] the living god
[1:24:09] in morphy invading himself in human
[1:24:11] flesh hallelujah
[1:24:13] he said broken every barrier every veil
[1:24:16] every veil nothing can hide his presence
[1:24:20] he said when people get hungry in their
[1:24:22] heart there's a veil
[1:24:24] ready to be broke you can just depend
[1:24:28] on that oh hallelujah
[1:24:31] if you'll get good and hungry god will
[1:24:33] break the barrier
[1:24:35] off of your life
[1:24:39] you know that jesus said blessed are
[1:24:41] they which do hunger and thirst after
[1:24:43] righteousness
[1:24:44] for they shall be filled if you hunger
[1:24:47] for this message
[1:24:48] you're blessed if you hunger for a move
[1:24:51] of god you're blessed
[1:24:52] [Music]
[1:24:54] the bible said in psalms 103 and 5 who
[1:24:57] satisfy thy mouth with good things
[1:24:59] so that thy youth is renewed like the
[1:25:01] eagle psalms 84 and 1
[1:25:03] how amiable are thy tabernacles o lord
[1:25:06] of hosts
[1:25:07] my so longest yea even fainteth
[1:25:10] for the courts of the lord my heart and
[1:25:12] my flesh cry out
[1:25:14] for the living god
[1:25:21] so if you'll get hungry something will
[1:25:24] break
[1:25:28] it's unlimited what will happen in this
[1:25:31] place
[1:25:32] if you get hungry
[1:25:35] i didn't know what i was saying last
[1:25:37] weekend when i told you to tell your
[1:25:39] neighbor when you walk back in the back
[1:25:41] door
[1:25:41] get ready god's gonna do something but
[1:25:44] if you get hungry enough
[1:25:46] for a move of god you'll have a move of
[1:25:48] god if you get hungry enough for an
[1:25:50] outpouring of the holy ghost
[1:25:51] you'll have an outpouring of the holy
[1:25:54] ghost if you get hungry
[1:25:55] for your children to have a good
[1:25:57] old-fashioned pentecostal experience
[1:26:00] you can get hungry and you can watch
[1:26:02] your children
[1:26:04] eat on the son of man you can watch them
[1:26:07] get a real deliverance
[1:26:08] you can watch them how the enemy came in
[1:26:11] and he ate off the joy off their life
[1:26:13] as they take a worm as a palmer as a
[1:26:15] caterpillar
[1:26:16] and he ate the joy of the lord off of
[1:26:19] your life
[1:26:20] he took the goodness the meekness the
[1:26:21] gentleness the self-control
[1:26:23] right off of your tree but there's a
[1:26:25] word of the lord that said that i
[1:26:27] will restore saith the lord
[1:26:31] anything that the enemy has robbed from
[1:26:33] you
[1:26:34] stole from you taken from you beaten off
[1:26:37] of you
[1:26:37] you are a people that have been restored
[1:26:42] [Applause]
[1:26:44] and the bible said in the book of job
[1:26:45] chapter 26 2 and 26
[1:26:48] that you shall eat in plenty and be
[1:26:51] satisfied
[1:26:52] and praise the name of the lord your god
[1:26:54] that had
[1:26:55] dealt wonderly with you and my people
[1:26:58] shall never be ashamed
[1:27:04] there are things that keep eating at
[1:27:06] your keep eating at your praise
[1:27:08] eating at your experience and the enemy
[1:27:10] keeps sending in diseases
[1:27:13] he knows what he's doing he knows what
[1:27:16] he's doing he's trying to eat away
[1:27:18] any bit of faith that you got
[1:27:21] all right you eat away your experience
[1:27:26] he'll eat away that the first love that
[1:27:29] you had for him
[1:27:31] that's what the ephesian church eggs did
[1:27:34] they lost
[1:27:36] their first love and anytime
[1:27:39] you lose your first love for him
[1:27:42] you have lost everything
[1:27:46] and here that thing keeps eating at you
[1:27:50] that's what a disease does it comes in
[1:27:53] maybe through a brew cell
[1:27:55] or through a demon of different ways and
[1:27:57] he comes in
[1:27:58] and he eats all the good cells out he
[1:28:01] starts attacking
[1:28:03] and he starts eating and here we have a
[1:28:06] scriptural form for this
[1:28:08] the things that have been eaten off
[1:28:10] throughout the ages
[1:28:11] that the scripture has told us that not
[1:28:14] only will they eat the things off of you
[1:28:17] but i'm going to restore those things
[1:28:20] but here he says that that you're not
[1:28:22] going to be in famine
[1:28:24] but you're going to eat in plenty let me
[1:28:27] tell you i i i
[1:28:28] sure have enjoyed being in this message
[1:28:31] because there's one thing that we know
[1:28:32] how to do in this message
[1:28:33] that's we know how to eat on the true
[1:28:35] living word of god
[1:28:37] and we do know how to eat on the outside
[1:28:39] too
[1:28:39] [Applause]
[1:28:41] but sometimes sometimes you you eat
[1:28:44] and finally get to a spot say hey
[1:28:47] that's right i have done ate enough
[1:28:50] banana pudding
[1:28:53] that i can't stuff no more down there i
[1:28:55] tell you this trace is good but i
[1:28:57] i just can't handle no more
[1:29:01] but the word of the lord is saying
[1:29:02] you're gonna eat in plenty
[1:29:05] and you're gonna be satisfied and that
[1:29:07] satisfaction
[1:29:08] will bring you to a praise a praise of
[1:29:11] my name
[1:29:12] because i have dealt wondrously with you
[1:29:15] i have not left you
[1:29:16] down there in captivity but i've brought
[1:29:19] you out
[1:29:19] to eat
[1:29:23] you're a blessed people you're not
[1:29:24] eating some pentecostal chicken feed
[1:29:27] you're eating i'm the carcass of the son
[1:29:30] of man
[1:29:33] oh blessed are you
[1:29:41] when jesus goes he's standing there in
[1:29:44] matthew chapter 12 and he starts pulling
[1:29:46] things out of history
[1:29:48] i i enjoy that when jesus starts
[1:29:51] starts telling to us about lifting him
[1:29:54] out of history
[1:29:55] and he starts talking to us about a
[1:29:57] woman
[1:29:58] that was a pagan that was a heathen that
[1:30:00] had traveled
[1:30:01] hundreds of miles on camelback just
[1:30:04] to hear the wisdom of solomon to see if
[1:30:08] what she was hearing
[1:30:09] would be true and jesus said that the
[1:30:12] queen of the south
[1:30:13] will rise up she'll rise up and
[1:30:17] in judgment to condemn this generation
[1:30:20] for she came from the uttermost part of
[1:30:22] the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon
[1:30:25] and here jesus says and a greater
[1:30:28] than solomon is here and brother brown
[1:30:32] said that this generation will be
[1:30:35] condemned
[1:30:36] when they wouldn't walk across the
[1:30:37] street just to hear the word of god
[1:30:40] i'm going to say something strong right
[1:30:42] here but this community
[1:30:44] is damned because they would not walk
[1:30:46] across the street
[1:30:48] and hear home appraiser or heal ronald
[1:30:50] spencer
[1:30:51] because that was not homophrasia a
[1:30:54] greater
[1:30:54] than solomon is here
[1:31:01] hallelujah it ain't ron's picture it
[1:31:04] ain't william bournemont it ain't
[1:31:06] temporary
[1:31:07] it's a greater that's solomon and
[1:31:10] greater than all the prophets
[1:31:11] is here
[1:31:16] she didn't have no air conditioning she
[1:31:18] was riding on a camel that was spitting
[1:31:20] she was riding on a dusty road but she
[1:31:23] was hungering
[1:31:24] after the true word of god
[1:31:30] [Applause]
[1:31:33] she brought all these gifts
[1:31:36] all these things and her actions towards
[1:31:40] the gift of god bestowed upon her a
[1:31:43] heaven
[1:31:46] salvation
[1:31:50] you see if you go to hungary
[1:31:53] some of you are sitting here because
[1:31:55] faith cometh by hearing
[1:31:58] you heard god was doing something
[1:31:59] amongst you you heard
[1:32:02] you heard i don't know what's wrong with
[1:32:04] him people down there but they sure are
[1:32:06] excited
[1:32:07] ah they them preachers get up and
[1:32:09] they're they just keep preaching like
[1:32:12] like like the god of the bible is is
[1:32:16] here today and they keep talking like
[1:32:20] like he's coming after people that
[1:32:22] believe him
[1:32:23] and i don't know i don't know exactly
[1:32:27] i don't understand everything but i i i
[1:32:30] believe
[1:32:31] that the bible says something about that
[1:32:34] and you're setting here
[1:32:35] because faith cometh by hearing
[1:32:41] who put that on the inside of you to
[1:32:43] come
[1:32:45] it's the deep calling
[1:32:48] to the deep now notice listen to this he
[1:32:51] said no
[1:32:52] he said i i should have shared it with
[1:32:54] so you can see it but it's a little bit
[1:32:56] a little bit lengthy not too long i
[1:32:57] trust you won't go to sleep during this
[1:32:59] if you do i'll come tap you on the
[1:33:01] shoulder but there it
[1:33:03] is somehow or another that that when the
[1:33:05] heart goes to hungering after god
[1:33:07] he said troubles don't look like
[1:33:08] anything he said you got your mindset no
[1:33:11] matter what anybody calls you they can
[1:33:12] call you whatever they want to
[1:33:14] they can say whatever they want to they
[1:33:16] can try to put
[1:33:17] something put every stumbling block in
[1:33:20] your way but
[1:33:21] if you're thirsting for god you're going
[1:33:23] to find it somewhere
[1:33:25] he said and nothing's going to stop you
[1:33:27] the husband ain't going to stop you
[1:33:29] your wife isn't going to stop you your
[1:33:31] church isn't going to stop you
[1:33:33] your pastor isn't going to stop you
[1:33:35] there's nothing can keep a saint away
[1:33:37] from his word
[1:33:38] of god his or from his his god if he
[1:33:41] really wants to see it
[1:33:42] he said no she never even thought of
[1:33:45] that
[1:33:45] he said and you don't think of it either
[1:33:47] what the what what this one is going to
[1:33:49] say
[1:33:50] and what mother's going to say and dad's
[1:33:52] going to say
[1:33:53] or or the husband's going to say when
[1:33:55] you come to find
[1:33:56] jesus christ to be a rally reality and
[1:33:59] you hear that he's alive
[1:34:01] and there is nothing going to stop you
[1:34:03] when that hunger that seed that's been
[1:34:05] predestinated
[1:34:06] before the foundation of the world when
[1:34:08] that light strikes that
[1:34:10] it's come to life that quick and this
[1:34:12] little woman was a type of a seed
[1:34:15] yet being an alien and a heathen
[1:34:19] she hungered so much that even the
[1:34:22] priest down there
[1:34:23] was not going to stop her from getting
[1:34:25] to the wisdom of solomon
[1:34:29] and when you start letting the word of
[1:34:30] god reign supreme in your life
[1:34:32] there's gonna be some barriers broke
[1:34:36] there's gonna be some things well you
[1:34:38] say well that person got it and i was
[1:34:39] standing real close and i didn't get it
[1:34:41] come on you have the same testimony
[1:34:45] that the man at the pool of bethesda
[1:34:48] said
[1:34:48] in john chapter 5 when he when jesus
[1:34:51] started talking to him
[1:34:52] he said he said he started talking he
[1:34:55] said he said whenever i go when the
[1:34:56] angel comes
[1:34:57] he said somebody jumps down in front of
[1:35:00] me
[1:35:01] and i miss my opportunity you have the
[1:35:04] same opportunity tonight
[1:35:06] as this one has or that one has
[1:35:10] that person got the holy ghost and you
[1:35:13] can too
[1:35:14] that woman with the blood issue touched
[1:35:16] him and you can took
[1:35:18] georgie carter believed in god and you
[1:35:21] came too
[1:35:21] hattie wright believed in god and she
[1:35:24] said that's nothing but the truth
[1:35:25] and you can too
[1:35:29] something is getting ready to shake off
[1:35:32] of your life
[1:35:40] if you get past it that plane if he ever
[1:35:43] gets
[1:35:43] past it a lot of times you
[1:35:47] you take off and you get to you're
[1:35:50] flying in your christian experience and
[1:35:52] you
[1:35:52] you take off and you start getting there
[1:35:56] and you come back down have to make an
[1:35:59] emergency landing
[1:36:02] i was getting up there in the clouds and
[1:36:03] i i i couldn't
[1:36:06] i couldn't see where i was going
[1:36:09] i started feeling shakes all over and i
[1:36:13] i felt something run down my neck and i
[1:36:16] ain't never felt like anything like it
[1:36:18] and i just backed off of it that plane
[1:36:24] when it gets to flying
[1:36:26] there's a pilot sitting up there he's
[1:36:28] flying that plane and
[1:36:30] he's going through the clouds he's going
[1:36:32] through the storms and he's and he's
[1:36:33] going up through air
[1:36:34] he don't just decide to quit because he
[1:36:38] can't see where he's going
[1:36:39] he don't just decide that well i'm
[1:36:41] grabbing my parachute i'll let everybody
[1:36:43] else grab a hold of their seat
[1:36:45] maybe we'll land in the ocean
[1:36:49] he doesn't just stop flying the plane
[1:36:52] because he can't see
[1:36:54] and neither should you stop flying in
[1:36:57] your pristine spirits
[1:36:59] in your experience and fly on past it
[1:37:02] flower past that same thing flying past
[1:37:04] mama did it daddy did it
[1:37:06] and break past it you ain't got to stop
[1:37:10] flying
[1:37:11] because you don't see the preacher
[1:37:12] standing out in front of you or your
[1:37:14] mama's standing out in front of you
[1:37:15] or some other christian standing out in
[1:37:17] front of you you might have to stand
[1:37:19] alone
[1:37:20] but god is going to have a testimony
[1:37:24] that there's a people that broke past
[1:37:26] the barriers
[1:37:27] and when you get past the barriers
[1:37:29] there's some unlimitations
[1:37:31] that will shake off of you and you will
[1:37:33] fly at a speed
[1:37:35] that only an eagle can fly at
[1:37:40] come on there's dna barriers
[1:37:45] there's unbelief barriers there's
[1:37:47] personal barriers
[1:37:49] and there are people that are like
[1:37:50] they're like onions
[1:37:53] they make you cry they got a lot of
[1:37:56] layers to them
[1:37:59] and they sit in church they sat in
[1:38:01] church for years
[1:38:03] and they make a pastor cry they sat
[1:38:07] there and they
[1:38:08] man they're good they put up a
[1:38:11] guard they put up a guard
[1:38:15] a defense mechanism that the word ain't
[1:38:18] gonna
[1:38:18] ain't gonna take this off of me
[1:38:22] that i i'm gonna throw up this guard and
[1:38:24] i i
[1:38:25] i know it's right but i'm enjoying out
[1:38:28] there and they
[1:38:29] they just got layers and layers and
[1:38:31] layers and layers
[1:38:33] that's why god gave you a pastor not an
[1:38:35] evangelist
[1:38:36] [Applause]
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:40] because a pastor is willing to stand
[1:38:43] right there in the pulpit and not give
[1:38:44] up on you
[1:38:45] and to stand there and work through the
[1:38:47] layers and tell you there's a holy ghost
[1:38:49] that'll cut through it
[1:38:50] you make him cry but the holy ghost is
[1:38:53] there to make a way through it
[1:38:55] and he'll get to the center of the
[1:38:56] problem and the pastor will stay right
[1:38:58] there
[1:38:59] hallelujah he'll stay right there until
[1:39:02] you get it
[1:39:03] he ain't going to leave you down there
[1:39:04] and lay out a seal living down there in
[1:39:06] that sin
[1:39:07] living down there in that situation but
[1:39:10] he's going to tell you
[1:39:11] there's a grace for you there's a blood
[1:39:13] for you it's a time
[1:39:15] that you start moving the barriers of
[1:39:17] unbelief and you start moving mountains
[1:39:22] you might have to roll it one grain at a
[1:39:24] time but you speak to that mountain
[1:39:26] who out there who breaks the rubble thou
[1:39:29] mountain
[1:39:29] that has come before us thou shall
[1:39:31] become a plague
[1:39:33] it's not thy might it's not by power but
[1:39:36] by my spirit saith the lord it's not the
[1:39:39] pastor
[1:39:40] it's not the evangelist it's the word
[1:39:43] that does the cute
[1:39:56] as long as
[1:40:00] there's breath in your lungs god don't
[1:40:03] have the mindset to give up
[1:40:08] mother andrew i have struggled
[1:40:13] i have struggled i have fought
[1:40:18] i have pushed i have cried i have spent
[1:40:21] hours in my closet crying out to god
[1:40:26] lord i need you lord take this thing
[1:40:30] away from me
[1:40:32] lord lord if you don't do it i
[1:40:35] uh you're gonna find a bag of bones here
[1:40:38] brother andrew i have struggled
[1:40:41] i have prayed for this disease to leave
[1:40:43] me i have prayed
[1:40:45] i have fasted i've asked i've done
[1:40:50] can i give you a quote
[1:40:54] he said if you can get beyond that sound
[1:40:56] barrier
[1:40:58] if you can get beyond that sin barrier
[1:41:00] of unbelief allah
[1:41:02] doesn't mean me could i be healed
[1:41:05] could i be saved could i be filled with
[1:41:08] the holy spirit
[1:41:12] he said get beyond that he said and just
[1:41:15] keep struggling
[1:41:17] and struggling and struggling until you
[1:41:20] break through
[1:41:21] and the holy ghost comes upon you
[1:41:24] i have prayed about this thing i have
[1:41:27] asked about this thing
[1:41:28] i know i'm saved i know i'm filled with
[1:41:30] the holy ghost but yet
[1:41:32] i still fight this thing in the night
[1:41:34] seasons
[1:41:37] just keep struggling just keep fighting
[1:41:42] don't you ever give up don't you ever
[1:41:44] give in
[1:41:45] you stay right there and you struggle
[1:41:47] and when you get past that thing
[1:41:49] you're gonna fly at an unlimited speed
[1:41:51] and you're gonna be able to look back at
[1:41:53] somebody else
[1:41:54] and say the grace of god got me past my
[1:41:58] barrier
[1:41:58] he'll get you past that barrier
[1:42:03] hallelujah he's more than enough
[1:42:11] and jesus stood there and asked him said
[1:42:12] who do men say that i the son of man
[1:42:14] have
[1:42:16] he said i have gift
[1:42:20] hallelujah i give you the keys
[1:42:25] to the kingdom whatsoever you bind on
[1:42:29] earth
[1:42:30] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[1:42:33] you loose on earth
[1:42:35] if you look up that word loose it means
[1:42:37] to break
[1:42:38] and whatsoever you break on earth i
[1:42:44] oh hallelujah mamas and daddies
[1:42:48] my little girls little boys i
[1:42:52] say unto you that whatsoever you break
[1:42:55] on earth
[1:42:57] shall be broken heaven
[1:43:00] hallelujah i'm going to destroy that
[1:43:02] thing i'm going to melt the chains off
[1:43:04] of their life
[1:43:05] i'm going to destroy i'm going to
[1:43:07] dissolve i'm going to break up
[1:43:09] i'm going to break down i'm going to
[1:43:11] lose any person
[1:43:17] that's what he said to you
[1:43:23] sometimes we look at things
[1:43:27] and we see it on the surface
[1:43:30] it's more than a scripture this is life
[1:43:35] he said i will loose you i will loose
[1:43:37] any person
[1:43:38] that's tied up or fastened up
[1:43:43] when they when they brought over in mark
[1:43:45] chapter 7
[1:43:47] they brought him verse 32 and they bring
[1:43:50] him unto him one
[1:43:51] that was death and had an impediment in
[1:43:53] his speech
[1:43:54] and they beseech him to put his hand
[1:43:57] upon him
[1:43:57] notice and he took him aside from the
[1:44:00] multitude
[1:44:01] and put his fingers in his ears and he
[1:44:03] spit and touched his tongue
[1:44:05] and he looking up to heaven he sighed
[1:44:07] and saith unto him empathy
[1:44:09] that is be opened and straightway his
[1:44:12] ears were opened
[1:44:14] and the string of his tongue was loosed
[1:44:16] and he spake plain
[1:44:21] what did he do he loosed the thing
[1:44:24] that was holding him
[1:44:38] this broke every barrier when jesus
[1:44:43] it's a good thing jesus took him away
[1:44:45] from the multitude to do this
[1:44:48] because some people look at the way
[1:44:50] jesus does things
[1:44:52] and or unorthodox amen
[1:44:55] amen why would god do it that way
[1:44:59] why and there's where a lot of people
[1:45:02] get caught up
[1:45:03] in limiting god
[1:45:07] god has come to you in some of the most
[1:45:09] unprecedented ways
[1:45:11] but he's coming and he takes him out
[1:45:14] there
[1:45:15] in the street and he sticks his finger
[1:45:18] in his ear
[1:45:20] and the pharisee said man i ain't found
[1:45:22] that in the book of moses
[1:45:27] now i'm going to go back to the tour and
[1:45:29] i'm gonna study that thing
[1:45:31] you got a devil on you
[1:45:35] he spits on the ground
[1:45:38] and then he takes his tongue
[1:45:42] and he says episode be open
[1:45:48] oh hallelujah hey something getting
[1:45:51] ready to be opened
[1:45:53] there's a barrier getting beaten getting
[1:45:54] ready to be broke off
[1:45:56] and he's going to speak over you when
[1:45:58] there was a woman
[1:45:59] that had had an infirmity for 18 years
[1:46:02] and she'd been bowed up and bowed over
[1:46:05] where she couldn't even move but the
[1:46:07] bible said that jesus
[1:46:09] called to her and says come here
[1:46:12] she ain't moved for 18 years but when
[1:46:14] jesus goes to call
[1:46:17] he says woman thou art loosed
[1:46:21] and he is saying over your womb be open
[1:46:24] and produce life he is saying i'm
[1:46:28] loosing your tongue
[1:46:29] to speak the true word of god
[1:46:33] and jesus said in mark 11 22 and 23
[1:46:36] have faith in god if you speak to this
[1:46:39] mountain
[1:46:40] and cast it to go out into the sea ask
[1:46:43] and it shall be given unto you
[1:46:46] he is loosing your tongue to speak the
[1:46:48] promises of god
[1:46:50] jesus was on his road and he's coming
[1:46:54] he's coming he's coming he's coming
[1:46:57] he's coming he might have to walk on
[1:47:00] water to get to you
[1:47:01] but he's coming he might get a headache
[1:47:04] and sit by the way and sit there and
[1:47:07] just wait on a casket to pass him
[1:47:09] but he's coming he might take your lunch
[1:47:12] box
[1:47:13] but he's going to feed 5 000 with it
[1:47:15] because he's coming
[1:47:17] he might break every sin barrier every
[1:47:19] reason and barrier
[1:47:20] but it's coming
[1:47:22] [Applause]

[1:47:44] that virtue was released to her because
[1:47:47] of how she did it

[1:50:16] child of god
[1:50:17] you're not a child of the devil you're a
[1:50:19] child of god
[1:50:22] whosoever is born of god does not commit
[1:50:24] sin for his seed remaineth in him
[1:50:27] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[1:50:30] god
[1:50:32] that barrier's got to be broke on the
[1:50:34] internet and in this place
[1:50:36] there is no hold on a child of god sin
[1:50:39] can't hold you
[1:50:40] sickness can't stay on you demons can't
[1:50:43] handle you
[1:50:43] you are loosed by the blood barriers
[1:50:46] have been broken
[1:50:48] you are of god little children
[1:50:53] and overcame him because greater is he
[1:50:56] that is in you and he that is in the
[1:50:58] world
[1:50:59] the blood has loosed us the blood has
[1:51:02] set us free
[1:51:04] be opened
[1:51:09] [Applause]
[1:51:17] you can only produce what you are
[1:51:22] you can't make this up you can't make
[1:51:24] you you can't you i can't even hype you
[1:51:26] up enough
[1:51:27] brother matthew can't sing you happy
[1:51:29] enough to make this work
[1:51:32] the preacher can't preach hard enough to
[1:51:34] make you work
[1:51:35] this way and live this way you are what
[1:51:38] you are
[1:51:41] you plant corn you get corn you plant
[1:51:44] sons of god you get sons of god
[1:51:46] that's what we're in the business of
[1:51:48] doing it's not my duty
[1:51:50] to tell you what you are it's my duty to
[1:51:53] preach the gospel
[1:51:54] and to cast the net there might be some
[1:51:56] scorpions come in
[1:51:58] there might be some there might be some
[1:51:59] lizards coming in
[1:52:01] other the snakes and different things
[1:52:03] but there's going to come some real
[1:52:04] rainbow trout out of this catch
[1:52:07] and he says let down thy net for a
[1:52:09] drought which means a catch of a
[1:52:11] lifetime
[1:52:12] now is the time to take god at his word
[1:52:15] and led down your neck
[1:52:18] i'm not just preaching to you something
[1:52:20] pentecostal i'm preaching to you
[1:52:21] something
[1:52:22] that's laying right there in the bible
[1:52:24] ask
[1:52:25] and you shall receive
[1:52:38] i don't have the strength to do it
[1:52:44] ah i'll be glad to put my shoulder
[1:52:47] on the stone with you and help you but i
[1:52:50] personally don't have the strength to do
[1:52:52] it
[1:52:53] all these ministers up here don't have
[1:52:55] the strength to do it
[1:52:58] it's not who i am but it's who i
[1:53:01] represent
[1:53:04] and if something supernatural would take
[1:53:06] place
[1:53:07] from this pulpit all the way in the back
[1:53:10] room
[1:53:12] it would tell you that there's something
[1:53:14] there
[1:53:17] you remember when brother banham is
[1:53:19] dealing with that
[1:53:20] that cross-eyed child in bombay and
[1:53:23] he's dealing with that child there and
[1:53:25] he's speaking to him
[1:53:27] and he's speaking through an interpreter
[1:53:28] and he's talking to him and he says now
[1:53:30] he said
[1:53:31] he said i can't heal him he said i can't
[1:53:34] heal him he said but
[1:53:35] he said if i could raise his faith up
[1:53:38] so that he could receive his healing or
[1:53:41] recognize it would raise his faith up
[1:53:44] that god would heal him he said i'm not
[1:53:47] the healer but god is
[1:53:49] and he he starts he starts
[1:53:53] talking and he says he said this young
[1:53:56] child he said he was a
[1:53:57] he's a real thin man and his family was
[1:54:00] real thin
[1:54:01] he said it was kind of strange for that
[1:54:03] tribe and he said all those tribes they
[1:54:04] were in that warfare and fences in
[1:54:06] between them
[1:54:07] and he said he said that was real
[1:54:08] strange he said but
[1:54:10] he said this this child he come
[1:54:13] from a family of christians and they
[1:54:16] were sitting back here on this side and
[1:54:17] he said
[1:54:18] he said there are real christians and he
[1:54:20] said if you'd walk into their house and
[1:54:22] walk in and look on the right-hand side
[1:54:24] of the
[1:54:24] room there he said you'd see the picture
[1:54:27] of christ
[1:54:28] and when that happened that boy's eyes
[1:54:30] come uncrossed
[1:54:32] and it caused quite uh an occurring
[1:54:36] going on there
[1:54:37] and people could see that we're real
[1:54:39] close that that boy's eyes had
[1:54:41] turned and went straight and and there
[1:54:43] was a doctor down there
[1:54:46] that that was having a tussle with
[1:54:47] brother bosworth and he started touching
[1:54:49] with him and
[1:54:50] he said i said i got to talk to brother
[1:54:52] branham i had to talk to him and he said
[1:54:54] well you can't talk to him he's under
[1:54:55] the anointing right now he said he can't
[1:54:56] talk to him
[1:54:57] and brother brad i'm seeing what was
[1:54:59] going on he said doctor he said what's
[1:55:00] going on he said how did you know i was
[1:55:02] a doctor
[1:55:03] he said well he said he said what what's
[1:55:04] what's the cause what's going on he said
[1:55:06] what did you do to him he said you did
[1:55:09] you touch him or do something to him he
[1:55:10] said i'm standing 10 feet from him he
[1:55:12] said i didn't touch him
[1:55:14] i didn't touch him he said did you
[1:55:15] hypnotize him he said shame on you
[1:55:18] he said shame on you you being a doctor
[1:55:20] he said if you believe in hypnotism that
[1:55:22] much why don't you stop
[1:55:23] practicing medicine and start practicing
[1:55:25] hypnotism if there's that much power in
[1:55:27] it why don't you start practicing
[1:55:29] he said he said what happened he said
[1:55:31] now he said
[1:55:32] now you you see that i'm standing here
[1:55:35] and the boy standing there
[1:55:37] he said if if if if you he said if you
[1:55:40] believe
[1:55:40] god heals he said you would have to
[1:55:42] recognize that there was something
[1:55:44] beyond here and there that there was god
[1:55:47] standing between
[1:55:48] us that did that work
[1:55:52] you see and if you would realize tonight
[1:55:54] that that it's not
[1:55:55] something right here but there's
[1:55:57] something between us and
[1:56:00] i want you to know it's not me it's not
[1:56:02] the preacher it's not my voice it's not
[1:56:04] my actions
[1:56:05] but it's the word of god that comes and
[1:56:07] heals there's something that is standing
[1:56:10] between me
[1:56:11] and you and that word is saying that i
[1:56:14] will break the barriers of humanity
[1:56:17] of unbelief of stigmas of complexes of
[1:56:21] sickness
[1:56:21] of different things off of your life
[1:56:25] there's something in between you and i
[1:56:28] that is breaking the things off
[1:56:32] of our lives
[1:56:36] you got a right to it you got a right to
[1:56:39] these things
[1:56:42] because god
[1:56:47] because god also uses barriers
[1:56:54] satan brings in barriers of unbelief of
[1:56:56] sickness and all these things and i'm
[1:56:57] going to be just a second
[1:57:01] god uses barriers too amen
[1:57:05] the bible said that that job was a hedge
[1:57:08] man
[1:57:08] amen that was more than a bush that was
[1:57:11] surrounding him
[1:57:12] there was spears and there was a sword
[1:57:14] of the lord that was surrounding joel
[1:57:17] and that ought to testify to you that
[1:57:19] there's a barrier that's around you
[1:57:21] you can look over in jeremiah and you
[1:57:23] can see that god sets boundaries about
[1:57:26] the sea
[1:57:26] and the bible said that he set sands
[1:57:28] upon the ocean
[1:57:30] to hold it into its place you see i want
[1:57:33] you to know that there
[1:57:35] is a boundary about the children of god
[1:57:38] that satan cannot get past and that
[1:57:40] satan cannot get through
[1:57:42] and david said in psalms 16 and 5 the
[1:57:45] lord
[1:57:46] is the pers portion of my inheritance of
[1:57:48] my cup thou maintaineth my lot
[1:57:50] the lines are falling under me in a
[1:57:52] pleasant place yea
[1:57:54] i have a goodly heritage i will bless
[1:57:56] the lord
[1:57:57] who have given me counsel my reigns also
[1:58:00] instruct me
[1:58:01] in the night seasons i have set the lord
[1:58:04] always before me
[1:58:05] because he is at my right hand and i
[1:58:08] shall not be moved
[1:58:12] god has set a boundary about you that
[1:58:14] satan
[1:58:15] can do all he wants to with his tactics
[1:58:17] he can't
[1:58:18] break through that barrier that god has
[1:58:21] put around you
[1:58:22] you remember it's a bumper of the blood
[1:58:25] of jesus christ
[1:58:27] hallelujah when you would have been
[1:58:30] condemned by some other man
[1:58:32] the bumper of the blood was there
[1:58:36] when i would have gave up on you when
[1:58:38] your family would have gave up on you
[1:58:39] the bumper of the blood of jesus says i
[1:58:42] they are
[1:58:43] mine hallelujah
[1:58:48] will not be
[1:58:51] moved ah
[1:58:55] why don't you stand up and say i have a
[1:58:57] goodly heritage
[1:59:01] hallelujah god has set boundaries about
[1:59:03] the sea
[1:59:04] surely he can set boundaries about me
[1:59:08] hallelujah let the musicians come
[1:59:10] hallelujah
[1:59:13] fear has to leave
[1:59:16] when god raises the standard
[1:59:40] satan has done his very best
[1:59:45] to break the cycle of blessing
[1:59:52] when when god was having a conversation
[1:59:54] with abraham
[1:59:56] and he had this at these words he said
[1:59:58] i'll bless them
[1:59:59] that bless you and i'll curse them that
[2:00:01] curse you
[2:00:03] you see if you do something
[2:00:06] for a blessed person you'll be blessed
[2:00:11] you you ever watched that there are
[2:00:13] seasons
[2:00:15] in your life or cycles in your life of
[2:00:16] blessings
[2:00:19] that there it just seems like anything
[2:00:21] you touch it just turns to gold
[2:00:23] and then there's seasons of their
[2:00:25] seasons of life that seem like
[2:00:28] man anything i touch falls apart amen
[2:00:32] you see there's cycles we keep a
[2:00:35] calendar
[2:00:36] as spencer's and dad was a great teacher
[2:00:39] in that and
[2:00:40] that it's amazing that if you we watch
[2:00:43] what happens every year
[2:00:45] things that you don't even know about or
[2:00:47] think about but because there are cycles
[2:00:50] you watch people will do the same things
[2:00:54] you go to certain places on the same day
[2:00:57] you eat a burger at the same place on
[2:00:58] the same day
[2:01:00] as last year there's cycles that are
[2:01:02] there
[2:01:03] this is more than a burger right here
[2:01:07] but there are cycles there there's
[2:01:09] cycles of blessings
[2:01:11] that's coming forth from the throne of
[2:01:13] god
[2:01:14] and satan is wanting to come in there
[2:01:16] and break
[2:01:18] break that barrier or that cycle of
[2:01:21] blessings
[2:01:22] you can watch and you can watch somebody
[2:01:24] man they're man they're soaring they're
[2:01:27] soaring
[2:01:27] and all of a sudden boom god comes in
[2:01:30] with a
[2:01:31] uh the enemy comes in with just a tactic
[2:01:34] and he tries to break it down and you
[2:01:36] watch the counting has changed and it
[2:01:38] seems like
[2:01:39] it takes them forever to get back on the
[2:01:41] mountain
[2:01:43] you see satan has come in to break the
[2:01:45] cycles
[2:01:46] of blessings you watch it in business
[2:01:49] you watch it in humanity
[2:01:51] but god has circled you with his love
[2:01:55] and his power and his spirit with
[2:01:58] goodness and mercy
[2:02:00] that no matter where you go he's got a
[2:02:03] hedge about you
[2:02:06] he's got a hedge about you and you're
[2:02:09] wondering what
[2:02:10] can i can i get through this can i can
[2:02:13] overcome this can i break through that
[2:02:15] cycle
[2:02:16] cycles of cursings just keep coming by
[2:02:19] it keeps circling my life and it seems
[2:02:21] like
[2:02:21] it's never going to happen it's never
[2:02:23] going to happen it's never going to
[2:02:24] happen
[2:02:26] let the word of god speak and break
[2:02:30] that thing because whatever you touch
[2:02:35] is blessed he said i have blessed
[2:02:38] you going in and coming out
[2:02:41] you're gonna walk out of here blessed
[2:02:45] but the enemy's going to try to come in
[2:02:47] and produce curses
[2:02:50] but there's a god
[2:02:53] there's a god that says
[2:02:56] down from my glory i'm coming
[2:03:00] for you
[2:03:04] i'm coming for you i'm coming for you
[2:03:07] amen there's going to be mountains be
[2:03:10] rolled away
[2:03:11] and stones taken apart
[2:03:15] taken out of the way
[2:03:18] amen because god's going to use young
[2:03:20] people
[2:03:21] god's going to use elderlies to sit
[2:03:23] right here and break the barriers
[2:03:26] by speaking thus saith the lord
[2:03:29] amen let's bow our heads this evening
[2:03:35] father god we we approach you just now
[2:03:40] lord knowing that there are things that
