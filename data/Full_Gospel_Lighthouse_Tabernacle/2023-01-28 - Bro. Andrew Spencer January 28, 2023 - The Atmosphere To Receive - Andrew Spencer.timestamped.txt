[48:15] alive and visible may we recognize the
[48:18] presence of the Living God right here

[48:23] ourselves unto you we ask Lord that you

[48:27] amen tonight father meet the children's
[48:30] needs in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[48:34] first Samuel first Samuel chapter 1 and
[48:37] verse 1 now there was a certain man of
[48:40] Rhema thaium so from of Mount Ephraim
[48:43] and his name was elkanah the son of
[48:46] Jerusalem the son of elahu the son of
[48:49] tohu the son of zoof of ephrath and an
[48:52] ephrathite and he had two wives the name
[48:55] of one was Hannah and the name of the
[48:57] other was panaya and banaya had children
[49:00] but Hannah had no children and this man
[49:03] went up out of his City yearly to
[49:05] worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord
[49:08] of hosts in shalom
[49:10] and the two sons of Eli hofna and
[49:13] Phineas the priest of the Lord were
[49:15] there and when the time was that elk and
[49:19] I offered to get to he gave when elkana
[49:23] offered he gave to panaya his wife and
[49:26] to all her sons and her daughters
[49:28] portions but unto Hannah he gave a
[49:30] worthy portion for he loved Hannah but
[49:33] the Lord had shut up her womb notice the
[49:36] Lord had shut up her womb and her
[49:39] adversary also provoked her sore for to
[49:42] make her fret because the Lord had shut
[49:44] up her womb
[49:46] ain't that a stinking enemy
[49:49] this is the Lord's doing but the enemy
[49:52] likes to get behind things
[49:54] and do a good job of being an adversary
[49:58] and as he did so year by year when she
[50:02] went up to the house of the Lord so she
[50:04] provoked her therefore she wept and did
[50:07] not did not eat then said elkana her
[50:10] husband to her Hannah why weepest thou
[50:13] and why Edith thou not and why is thy
[50:15] heart grieved and not I better to thee
[50:18] than ten Sons so Hannah rose up after
[50:21] they had eaten and shallow and after
[50:24] they had drunk now Eli the priest had
[50:26] set upon a seat by a post of the Temple
[50:28] of the Lord and she was in bitterness of
[50:31] soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept
[50:32] sore and she vowed a vowel and said oh
[50:35] lord of hosts if thou will indeed look
[50:37] on the infliction of thine handmaid and
[50:40] remember me
[50:41] remember me and not forget thy handmaid
[50:44] but will thou give will give unto thine
[50:46] handmaid a man-child then I will give
[50:49] him unto the Lord all the days of his
[50:51] life and there shall no razor come upon
[50:53] his head and they come to pass as she
[50:55] continued praying before the Lord that
[50:58] Eli marked her mouth now Hannah she
[51:01] spake in her heart only her lips moved
[51:03] but her voice was not heard therefore
[51:06] Eli thought she had been drunken
[51:10] and Eli said unto her how long will thou
[51:12] be drunk and put away thy wine from me
[51:14] and Hannah answered and said no my Lord
[51:17] I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit I
[51:20] have drunk neither wine nor strong drink
[51:22] but have poured out my soul before the
[51:25] Lord
[51:26] count not thine handmade for a daughter
[51:28] of Belial for out of the abundance of my
[51:31] complaint and grief have I spoken
[51:33] hitherto then Eli answered and said go
[51:35] in peace and the god of Israel Grant
[51:38] thee thy petition
[51:39] that thou has asked of him and he said
[51:42] and she said let thy handmaid find Grace
[51:46] in thy sight so the woman went her way
[51:49] and did eat and her countenance was no
[51:53] more sad
[51:55] Isaiah chapter 44 and verse 2.
[51:59] and as you're turning there
[52:01] I'd like to speak to you tonight on the
[52:03] atmosphere to receive
[52:06] the atmosphere to receive and brother
[52:08] Branham said in the message the
[52:09] supernatural
[52:11] he said any person that ever come into
[52:13] the atmosphere one time will never be
[52:16] satisfied nowhere else
[52:18] Isaiah chapter 44 and verse 2.
[52:22] thus saith the Lord that made thee
[52:24] informed thee from the womb and will
[52:27] help thee fear not o Jacob my servant
[52:29] and now Jesse run whom I have chosen or
[52:33] I will pour out water upon him that is
[52:35] thirsty and floods upon the dry ground I
[52:38] will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my
[52:42] blessing upon thy Offspring and they
[52:44] shall spring up as among the grass as
[52:47] willows by the watercourses may God
[52:49] bless his word he may be seated in the
[52:52] presence of the Lord as I said we'd like
[52:53] to speak to you tonight on the
[52:54] atmosphere the atmosphere to received
[52:57] brother Branham said in the message
[52:59] convinced and then concerned he said so
[53:01] I believe tonight that the holy spirit
[53:04] is here it's here for those who are
[53:06] destined to receive it who that believes
[53:08] it who is waiting on it it's here to
[53:11] straighten out every one of them
[53:12] spiritual problems he said it's here to
[53:15] heal every sick person that's present
[53:18] it's here
[53:19] so the holy spirit is here for those
[53:22] that it's destined for it's here to heal
[53:24] every spiritual problem it's here to
[53:27] heal every sick person that's present
[53:29] it's here but you've got to come and get
[53:31] into the atmosphere of it and the
[53:33] attitude to receive it you've got to
[53:36] come in not in an emotional workup
[53:38] you've got to come upon the basis of
[53:41] believing a promise that God made that
[53:44] doesn't that's what does it and I think
[53:47] it's a very wonderful thing that we
[53:49] recognize that we are living where we
[53:51] are and I think it's a wonderful thing
[53:53] that if you can look and see where you
[53:55] are and where you're living at but to
[53:57] look that tonight that we can look all
[53:59] the way back through prophecy and look
[54:01] through the Old Testament and see that
[54:03] there was Promises of the days of Jesus
[54:05] that was coming and when Jesus came he
[54:07] fulfilled all of the prophecy that was
[54:10] laying there for him to fulfill now we
[54:12] recognize that Jesus Christ fulfilled
[54:15] all that was told of him in the Old
[54:17] Testament but we recognize that we are
[54:19] here living out this generation and here
[54:22] we are as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[54:24] sowing forth that he is still alive and
[54:27] he's still the same yesterday today and
[54:30] forever and we're living here at the
[54:32] winding up of all of the prophecies and
[54:34] I think that we've been given as the
[54:36] children of God one of the most greatest
[54:37] opportunities of the hour to be living
[54:40] in is to witness the very power and the
[54:43] confirmation of his resurrection it's
[54:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost living
[54:48] amongst the Church of the Living God and
[54:51] to think that that that God would choose
[54:53] such a people as ourselves to come and
[54:56] live in the most wicked and the most
[54:58] adulterous generation and there is going
[55:01] to be an overcomer that lives out lives
[55:04] out this day and doesn't knock down to
[55:06] the devil's ideas and not not give in to
[55:08] what he says about her or what he thinks
[55:11] about her but this bride of Jesus Christ
[55:14] has been foreseen overcoming every devil
[55:18] and every tactic that was that was said
[55:20] about about the Church of the Living God
[55:23] this bride will overcome every enemy and
[55:27] I think that that the reason why we can
[55:29] have such a fervancy in our heart is
[55:31] that there is prophecy that we're riding
[55:33] on there there is a fulfillment of
[55:36] scripture that you and I are riding on
[55:38] tonight that God is going to have a
[55:41] spotless bride tonight and to think that
[55:43] that we're living right here where we
[55:46] recognize that we are already here on
[55:49] the cusp of the Rapture and we're right
[55:51] here at the culmination of all things
[55:53] where we're where we're watching the
[55:55] blending of Eternity with a blending of
[55:57] time and you're you're watching as our
[55:59] bodies are getting ready to change and
[56:01] and I believe that it's a wonderful time
[56:03] as a Church of the Living God to be
[56:05] living in and to recognize that the time
[56:08] has come for us to stand like never
[56:10] before and I don't think it's a time
[56:12] that we ought to waver on our faith I
[56:14] don't believe it's a time that we ought
[56:16] to back off when people call us Fanatics
[56:18] for believing what we believe leave but
[56:20] I I believe that that we ought to be
[56:22] more scared of the people that are
[56:23] afraid of us than the Fanatics that
[56:25] might be sitting around but I believe
[56:27] that right here tonight that in the
[56:29] atmosphere like you feel tonight I know
[56:31] that you're aware of it you're
[56:32] accustomed and you you understand that
[56:35] you're in the presence of the Shekinah
[56:37] Glory that Aaron would walk up there he
[56:39] would walk in there year after year but
[56:41] you recognize that you are in that
[56:44] presence and it's not something that you
[56:46] do you weekly after weekly but it's
[56:48] something that you do day after day it's
[56:51] not something that leaves you but it's
[56:53] something that goes with you and it
[56:55] guides you and to think that this
[56:56] atmosphere is here and it's here to
[56:59] change your bodies it's here to give you
[57:01] a faith to believe like never before
[57:04] I think it's a wonderful thing that we
[57:06] recognize that that where we are
[57:10] you know for anything the atmosphere has
[57:12] got to be right for anything to happen
[57:15] the atmosphere has got to be right
[57:18] you go to a you go to a place of
[57:20] business and they're trying to sell you
[57:22] whether it may be jewelry or sell you
[57:24] some kind of some kind of piece of
[57:26] furniture they have the ability and they
[57:28] they know what they're doing because
[57:30] they've studied out business for so long
[57:33] that they know they how to set an
[57:35] atmosphere to get you in a buying mood
[57:37] there are salesmen that have certain
[57:39] pictures that they'll throw at you just
[57:42] to make you feel like you really need
[57:44] this item you go into a jewelry store
[57:46] they've got the lights set at a certain
[57:48] place they've got they've got the Black
[57:49] Velvet over top of the diamonds they've
[57:51] got the light underneath of it just so
[57:53] they can sell you on the point and the
[57:55] more light that you put on it over the
[57:58] darkness the greater that that diamond
[57:59] shows but you see what are they doing
[58:01] they're creating an atmosphere if you go
[58:04] to a nice restaurant and it you really
[58:06] they really know what they're doing
[58:07] they've got the tune set at a certain
[58:10] decibel so that it doesn't flutter your
[58:12] heart in such a way but they've got it
[58:14] set so that you get in the atmosphere
[58:16] and you enjoy yourself and you think man
[58:19] that food was amazing but what it was
[58:21] they were playing on all of your senses
[58:24] now I think that if the world in the
[58:26] carnal world can play on your senses in
[58:28] such a way that they could build up a
[58:31] stake or or they could build up a light
[58:32] and they could put it out before you and
[58:34] have the knights can sitting in a right
[58:36] spot and have the have the lighting just
[58:39] dim to a certain spot if they can work
[58:41] on that kind of atmosphere how much more
[58:44] is a Church of the Living God how much
[58:46] more so would we be able to recognize
[58:48] that there's an atmosphere that is
[58:50] setting here and if we want anything to
[58:52] happen tonight the atmosphere has got to
[58:54] be right brother Brandon would tell us
[58:55] who said you get the music right on the
[58:57] piano you get the music right on the
[58:59] organ and you watch Supernatural things
[59:01] begin to happen and I know that there's
[59:03] a lot of people that that want to kick
[59:05] out organs they don't want to kick out
[59:06] they want to kick out the string
[59:07] instruments and they want to kick out
[59:09] the piano but the Bible said let
[59:11] everything
[59:12] the Bible said let everything that hath
[59:14] breath praise you the Lord he said
[59:16] praise him on a high standard symbol
[59:18] praise him on a low sounding symbol so
[59:20] if the Bible said that these things are
[59:22] going to be there we ought to use them
[59:24] to the ability to bring about something
[59:27] Supernatural
[59:28] now we ain't got no fog machines and we
[59:31] ain't got no big lights here tonight but
[59:33] there is a word that is created an
[59:35] atmosphere here tonight that can set the
[59:38] tone for the supernatural to take place
[59:40] the Bride of Jesus Christ don't need the
[59:42] lighting right she don't need she don't
[59:44] need a fog machine she don't need
[59:46] somebody to get up and make her feel all
[59:49] ugly and googly she just needs the word
[59:51] of God to come pass over her in the
[59:54] right atmosphere and you watch as
[59:56] Miracles begin to transpire
[1:00:04] he said but that's the hardest thing to
[1:00:06] do is to get people in that kind of an
[1:00:09] atmosphere an atmosphere of worshiping
[1:00:11] an atmosphere of believing
[1:00:15] now I I find it very hard
[1:00:19] as as a man of God that stands here week
[1:00:22] in after weekend that know that you know
[1:00:23] how to set an atmosphere
[1:00:25] that knows that you know how to worship
[1:00:27] that knows that you know how to believe
[1:00:29] that God would lay this on my heart
[1:00:32] in such a way to preach it to you that
[1:00:35] we've got to get in an atmosphere to
[1:00:37] receive you already know how to create
[1:00:38] an atmosphere he was here before I ever
[1:00:41] got to the pulpit you entered into
[1:00:43] worship what does it do it is setting a
[1:00:45] tone for the service but I believe that
[1:00:48] right now that I believe that God's got
[1:00:51] something in store for the Church of the
[1:00:53] Living God and I believe that the Winds
[1:00:55] of rapture are blowing like never before
[1:00:58] they're blowing through this building
[1:01:00] you may not be able to sense it or you
[1:01:02] may not be able to see it but there's a
[1:01:04] holy wind that is brooding across the
[1:01:07] Church of the Living God and it is
[1:01:09] preparing her and it is preparing her to
[1:01:12] leave this whole world now I'm going to
[1:01:14] tell you tonight if I if I didn't
[1:01:16] believe that this was true I surely
[1:01:18] wouldn't let my children sit underneath
[1:01:19] of this tonight if I didn't believe this
[1:01:21] with all of my heart I wouldn't invite
[1:01:23] you here after weekend after weekend to
[1:01:26] try to tell you that this this works if
[1:01:28] it doesn't work but I can sit here under
[1:01:31] the auspices of the Holy ghost and I can
[1:01:34] tell you that if we get the atmosphere
[1:01:36] right that we can watch healings
[1:01:38] transpire we can watch families restore
[1:01:41] we can watch people that have broken
[1:01:43] hearts watch them with a contrite spirit
[1:01:46] what's the peace of God pass over their
[1:01:49] life
[1:01:53] I believe anything that is worth is
[1:01:55] worth doing is worth doing it well and
[1:01:57] so I believe that if we're going to
[1:01:59] serve God then we ought to serve him
[1:02:01] with all of our capacity we ought to be
[1:02:04] all in in everything that we do we
[1:02:06] shouldn't do anything half-heartedly
[1:02:10] you wouldn't want me up here if I was
[1:02:12] half-hearted you wouldn't want me Pup
[1:02:14] here preaching to you the message of
[1:02:16] Jesus Christ if I was out there trying
[1:02:18] to live every type of way and then come
[1:02:20] up here and speak in tongues dance and
[1:02:22] shout and preach you the word of God
[1:02:24] when I was out during the week when I
[1:02:27] was living all kinds of sin you wouldn't
[1:02:29] want me behind the pulpit but you get
[1:02:31] somebody that knows who they are been
[1:02:34] born again by the Holy Ghost
[1:02:39] all right
[1:02:41] what is it we are living in the hour
[1:02:43] where manifested sons of God are walking
[1:02:46] out there by the power of God and going
[1:02:49] out there and taking the very power away
[1:02:51] from Satan because you recognize that
[1:02:54] that power belongs to you every devil is
[1:02:58] underneath your feet I heard the prophet
[1:03:00] say this week he said if you are the
[1:03:02] skin on the bottom of the feet every
[1:03:05] devil inhales underneath of you
[1:03:11] atmosphere ain't got nothing to do with
[1:03:13] how you feel
[1:03:16] atmosphere ain't got nothing to do what
[1:03:18] you see
[1:03:21] there are certain people that you just
[1:03:23] love to be around because they've got an
[1:03:24] atmosphere
[1:03:26] and there are certain people that Satan
[1:03:29] is scared to get around
[1:03:34] you know I I'm thinking I was thinking
[1:03:36] you know you know they they at certain
[1:03:39] times in a year they give out these
[1:03:40] Awards or they have award ceremonies in
[1:03:43] football season they give out they give
[1:03:46] out the all-americans and or they give
[1:03:48] out the the first in the nation or they
[1:03:50] give out the best in the defense so they
[1:03:51] give out this that or the other but I'd
[1:03:54] like to just maybe just take a look down
[1:03:57] in hell and see maybe you know you could
[1:04:00] just let your mind just drift for a
[1:04:01] minute or begin to imagine hell having
[1:04:03] an award ceremony down there can you
[1:04:06] imagine hell going down there and say
[1:04:09] hey your first team all district you
[1:04:12] went up there and you defeated that guy
[1:04:14] with cancer and we're giving you your
[1:04:16] ceremonial Badge go ahead and tell
[1:04:19] everybody down there in Hell How Great
[1:04:21] Thou Art and you can imagine as hell's
[1:04:23] going around and all the demons are all
[1:04:25] pumped up about it you see what they're
[1:04:27] doing is they are in an atmosphere where
[1:04:30] they're rallying around somebody being
[1:04:31] defeated but I wonder tonight if we
[1:04:34] would if we would be able to stop all
[1:04:36] the ceremonies that would be transpiring
[1:04:39] down in hell that this one right here
[1:04:42] this demon all slew foot right here he
[1:04:45] didn't get a badge because he went up to
[1:04:47] Elkton Virginia and he'd come back
[1:04:49] whooped
[1:04:53] if that's the case I want to make sure
[1:04:56] every death
[1:04:57] that you come up against doesn't never
[1:05:00] get a ceremony it's time that the demons
[1:05:03] that you've been facing in your life
[1:05:05] that you start addressing the Devils
[1:05:07] that came attacking you time and time
[1:05:10] again
[1:05:12] foreign
[1:05:14] Demons of depression
[1:05:16] it's time that they start losing Demons
[1:05:20] of suicide it's time that they start
[1:05:22] losing Demons of pornography it's time
[1:05:25] that they start losing Demons of of
[1:05:28] unsettledness it's time that they start
[1:05:31] losing Demons of anxiety it's time that
[1:05:34] they start losing
[1:05:36] Demons of cancer it's time that they
[1:05:39] start losing Demons of depression Demons
[1:05:42] of anxiety Demons of fear demons are
[1:05:45] paralysis
[1:05:46] [Applause]
[1:05:48] thank you
[1:05:50] baby
[1:05:53] but you've got to come to a point in
[1:05:54] your life when you're ready to address
[1:05:56] the devil in your life
[1:06:00] you've got to come to a spot in your
[1:06:02] life as a son and daughter of God where
[1:06:04] you address the enemy that keeps
[1:06:06] attacking you you know if he keeps
[1:06:08] attacking you over certain things that
[1:06:11] happened 20 years ago you know he ain't
[1:06:13] nothing but a liar
[1:06:15] but if the devil keeps whispering in
[1:06:17] your ear week after week well you know
[1:06:19] you know you shouldn't be going to
[1:06:21] church because you've been out there
[1:06:22] smoking and all those things
[1:06:24] it's something that you need to address
[1:06:27] but if the devil's been lying to you and
[1:06:30] telling you that you're not going to
[1:06:31] make it and you're never going to be
[1:06:33] good enough I want you to rise up and
[1:06:35] the faith of almighty God and Stamp Out
[1:06:38] every death
[1:06:41] there's going to be somebody that rises
[1:06:44] in this generation that walks out there
[1:06:46] and takes the very power
[1:06:48] away from Satan now notice I think it's
[1:06:51] a very powerful spot that brother
[1:06:52] Branham drops this in the in broken
[1:06:54] sisters 1965. he said it takes an
[1:06:57] atmosphere to do things he said that's
[1:06:59] the reason that you men are always
[1:07:00] taught bring your children here well
[1:07:03] certainly that's right he said he said I
[1:07:04] was glad to see my daughter Rebecca come
[1:07:06] in sit down just a few minutes ago he
[1:07:08] said some of you seen me weak at a woman
[1:07:10] he said it was my daughter he said so
[1:07:12] she came in and sat down he said I want
[1:07:15] her to receive the baptism of the spirit
[1:07:17] and he said that's why she's here in the
[1:07:20] meeting that's what the purpose of it is
[1:07:22] for it takes an atmosphere
[1:07:26] now I think if William Branham could
[1:07:27] could call a meeting and he could say I
[1:07:30] want to get my daughter in that kind of
[1:07:32] a meeting I think that we ought to do
[1:07:34] everything under this Malachi 4 Ministry
[1:07:37] to get our children in that type of
[1:07:40] atmosphere
[1:07:41] brother randomly he would quote die he
[1:07:44] would quote on Dr Bosworth he would tell
[1:07:46] her he would say now he said you know he
[1:07:48] said you can lay a hand egg underneath
[1:07:50] old pup and he said it'll hatch he said
[1:07:53] because it simply takes an atmosphere
[1:07:57] now I know some of you I know some of
[1:08:00] you came out of denominationalism and it
[1:08:02] doesn't make you it doesn't make you a
[1:08:04] part of that denominationalism but do
[1:08:06] you recognize that it takes an
[1:08:07] atmosphere to create a birth
[1:08:10] now know of people that gave their heart
[1:08:12] to the Lord of watching a little house
[1:08:14] on a prairie I know I know a man that
[1:08:16] gave his heart out there on the streets
[1:08:18] of Victoria when there were people
[1:08:20] walking around that were drunk on
[1:08:22] natural wine but there was somebody up
[1:08:24] there that got stimulated by the Holy
[1:08:26] Ghost
[1:08:27] so you see it doesn't necessarily matter
[1:08:29] where exactly it is church is the
[1:08:31] greatest place for it to happen at but
[1:08:34] you can have this kind of atmosphere
[1:08:37] in your home
[1:08:40] [Applause]
[1:08:41] is that right now the Bible said in
[1:08:44] Deuteronomy 4 and 29 but if if from
[1:08:47] thence Thou shalt seek the Lord thy God
[1:08:49] and thou shall find him if thou seek him
[1:08:53] with all the heart and with all thy Soul
[1:08:56] we we recognize that that there is
[1:08:59] something on the inside of a human being
[1:09:01] that makes him long for more of God
[1:09:04] that's why you're sitting here tonight
[1:09:06] is because something is on the inside of
[1:09:08] you and it's making you hunger for
[1:09:11] almighty God
[1:09:12] is that right you see and there is
[1:09:15] always going to be a time that God has a
[1:09:18] word that is going to be fulfilled in a
[1:09:21] generation and when he's got a word
[1:09:23] that's going to be fulfilled there's
[1:09:24] going to be a people that is ready to
[1:09:27] receive it just like when it came time
[1:09:29] for the deliverer to come to Israel when
[1:09:33] Israel had got so under the condition of
[1:09:36] the taxing of all the task Masters down
[1:09:38] there in Egypt there was a call that
[1:09:41] came across the Israelites Hearts to go
[1:09:43] to praying for the deliverer you see God
[1:09:47] had to get them in the atmosphere to
[1:09:50] call for deliver
[1:09:52] y now you read the reason why they were
[1:09:54] calling for a deliverer is because God
[1:09:56] had already showed his prophet Abraham
[1:09:58] that God was going to bring them into a
[1:10:01] Strange Land
[1:10:03] so God lays out his map of how things
[1:10:06] are going to be throughout the scripture
[1:10:09] and God has got people that are looking
[1:10:11] all the way back when Abraham and Joseph
[1:10:14] had begin to pray what were they looking
[1:10:17] at they were looking at prophecy over
[1:10:19] 400 years ago
[1:10:22] now what was it it was amram and Joseph
[1:10:26] had that got under a hunger for the
[1:10:29] deliverer and they got up there brother
[1:10:31] random said they got up there and they
[1:10:33] begin to pray until the word of God
[1:10:35] began to be fulfilled and you know the
[1:10:38] story that the angel came and met amram
[1:10:40] because he went up there to pray
[1:10:43] what was it it was a hunger on the
[1:10:46] inside of Abraham and Josephine
[1:10:49] they were hungering for the move of God
[1:10:52] now you've been sitting here and you've
[1:10:54] watched as there are mothers that are
[1:10:56] sitting here that have said here maybe
[1:10:58] five years but now their son sitting
[1:11:01] beside them
[1:11:04] there's all kinds of cases that are all
[1:11:06] throughout this building it was because
[1:11:07] a mother or a father begin to pray that
[1:11:11] God would deliver their children out of
[1:11:13] the bondage that they were in what was
[1:11:15] it it was a hunger that was on their
[1:11:18] heart to see the move of God in their
[1:11:20] life and that's exactly what Abraham and
[1:11:23] Joseph did had got up there under the
[1:11:25] inspiration of Abraham and they got up
[1:11:28] there and began to pray
[1:11:30] Hallelujah they begin to pray and it's
[1:11:33] usually those that go to praying is the
[1:11:35] one who's got the burden and they're the
[1:11:37] one that get to see the thing done
[1:11:45] hungry
[1:11:48] hungry just give me just a second here
[1:11:51] beat every day of your life
[1:11:56] discomforted every single day
[1:12:00] working under the slave master's hand I
[1:12:03] would say that it would create a hunger
[1:12:06] in your life
[1:12:09] I know I know I know I know that
[1:12:11] everybody hadn't went out and seen
[1:12:13] and done by awful Deeds but anybody that
[1:12:16] ever smoked cigarettes
[1:12:18] knows that that's a real devil
[1:12:21] and there are some people that can go
[1:12:23] can go and they get under the
[1:12:26] inspiration of the message or by the
[1:12:28] preaching of the word and you watch them
[1:12:31] and they're automatically they come and
[1:12:33] they've been a smoker a chain smoker for
[1:12:35] all of those years and all of a sudden
[1:12:37] in his presence they drop it and never
[1:12:39] go back to it and there's some people
[1:12:41] that fight it all their days
[1:12:43] you see it's God that calleth and to him
[1:12:46] that willeth and to him that runeth God
[1:12:49] is the one that shows the mercy now you
[1:12:51] watch you watch there there are things
[1:12:54] that you know that you faced in your in
[1:12:56] the demons in your life that are
[1:12:58] constantly there it causes a hunger on
[1:13:02] the inside of you for freedom
[1:13:05] is that right each and every one of you
[1:13:08] face little bitty stigmas or complexes
[1:13:11] yeah
[1:13:13] maybe living under the shadow of
[1:13:16] somebody greater than you and it makes
[1:13:18] you have maybe a complex or or maybe
[1:13:21] just a just maybe you you begin to think
[1:13:23] things in your mind and Satan starts
[1:13:26] telling you
[1:13:29] you'll get hungry
[1:13:31] like amram and Joseph begin to get
[1:13:34] hungry for to deliver to come by their
[1:13:36] way
[1:13:37] you see you can sit here and you can
[1:13:39] watch all of the children of God get so
[1:13:41] under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:43] but something's got to move on your life
[1:13:46] there are people that say well let's
[1:13:48] just let them do their thing and when
[1:13:50] they get done we'll walk out with them
[1:13:52] and we'll make will make them think that
[1:13:55] we're a part of them
[1:13:56] you've got to get a hunger on the inside
[1:13:59] of your soul
[1:14:02] not an emotion not a wire cup not just
[1:14:05] something that you feel but something
[1:14:07] that is a true Pentecostal experience
[1:14:14] now watch what brother Branham does when
[1:14:16] he he's here speaking with some patients
[1:14:18] he said he said now and the message do
[1:14:21] you believe he said you also suffer with
[1:14:23] the same you have been to some doctors
[1:14:25] you've given the examination and that
[1:14:27] examination he tells you that you must
[1:14:29] have an operation and the operation the
[1:14:31] entire female section must be taken out
[1:14:34] but do you believe that Jesus Christ
[1:14:36] will make you well you've been thirsting
[1:14:38] for God you've been hungering for a
[1:14:41] closer walk it has been just a day or
[1:14:44] two ago to you are praying for this
[1:14:46] thing he said I'm not reading your mind
[1:14:48] that's the truth you believe that right
[1:14:50] now that the spirit that's on you that's
[1:14:52] on me and on you has healed you of this
[1:14:55] female trouble you accept it right now
[1:14:57] with all your heart will you seek God
[1:14:59] till he pours out the Holy Spirit upon
[1:15:01] you if he will heal you or without or
[1:15:03] heal you without your operation will you
[1:15:05] do it almighty God I bless this woman in
[1:15:08] the name of Jesus Christ and curse this
[1:15:11] disease and come out of her in Jesus
[1:15:13] Christ's name amen go rejoice and sister
[1:15:16] God bless you yes what was it she was in
[1:15:21] the atmosphere of the supernatural
[1:15:24] but something on the inside of her was
[1:15:27] great Hallelujah you may have walked
[1:15:30] into a line with a certain disease but
[1:15:32] the prophet of almighty God saw
[1:15:35] something that was laying there that was
[1:15:37] greater than the disease that shaped
[1:15:39] Hallelujah that Satan could put on your
[1:15:42] life and you thought that you walked in
[1:15:44] here and you were battling depression
[1:15:46] but it's Satan trying to cover up the
[1:15:49] hunger
[1:15:52] come on somebody help me preach tonight
[1:15:55] if God has called you here there ain't
[1:15:58] one disease there ain't one devil that
[1:16:01] can hide
[1:16:10] he said now another place he said well
[1:16:13] you look why what are you looking so
[1:16:14] earnestly this way for sir do you
[1:16:16] believe me to be his Prophet you do all
[1:16:19] right if you believe me to be his
[1:16:20] Prophet you're sitting there earnestly
[1:16:22] seeking for God you're hungering
[1:16:25] for God
[1:16:28] you are nervous
[1:16:30] upset
[1:16:32] and you have a stomach trouble and
[1:16:33] things has bothered you because you're
[1:16:36] nervous
[1:16:37] but one of the main things that you're
[1:16:39] looking for is you're trying to receive
[1:16:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:43] if it is raise up your hand then in the
[1:16:46] name of Jesus Christ receive the spirit
[1:16:48] go receive the Holy Ghost you had a
[1:16:51] tumor didn't you all right it's left you
[1:16:53] while you were standing here go in the
[1:16:55] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and be
[1:16:57] made well you see you were formed and
[1:17:00] fashioned to be an image of almighty God
[1:17:03] but Satan can attach himself through the
[1:17:06] blood cell of your body and die begin to
[1:17:09] tap in and cause all kinds of Bruce
[1:17:11] cells or different things in your life
[1:17:15] but in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:18] [Music]
[1:17:21] I want to tell you and I want to make
[1:17:22] you aware that you are in the atmosphere
[1:17:24] to receive your healing
[1:17:27] you are in the atmosphere to drive
[1:17:29] depression out of your life and let
[1:17:31] peace that passes all understanding flow
[1:17:35] over you
[1:17:37] [Music]
[1:17:39] you have battled and battled and battled
[1:17:44] men have provoked you men have
[1:17:46] criticized you but you are in an
[1:17:48] atmosphere to receive
[1:17:50] healing
[1:17:54] you see the atmosphere has got to be
[1:17:56] ready
[1:17:58] now I know that I know you're very aware
[1:18:02] that when brother Ron went through the
[1:18:04] went through the fire
[1:18:06] the brother biscal called him even
[1:18:08] though he was at his worst state that
[1:18:10] brother bisco called him and said or
[1:18:12] called Mom and said he's going to be the
[1:18:13] next year speaker
[1:18:16] is that right you know the story
[1:18:18] he's going to we bought Mount Baker camp
[1:18:19] and he's going to be the speaker next
[1:18:21] year now let me say this just to grab
[1:18:23] you just to draw draw your attention in
[1:18:25] this way
[1:18:26] brother biscoll could have never said
[1:18:28] that five years
[1:18:29] or it never would have been related to
[1:18:31] brother Ron or sister Connie
[1:18:33] until the accident happened
[1:18:36] you see the atmosphere was ready for the
[1:18:39] supernatural when brother Ron went
[1:18:41] through the fire and when brother Ron
[1:18:43] was laying there in his condition when
[1:18:45] he was laying there for 17 days he'd
[1:18:47] been laying there 36 hours brain dead
[1:18:49] and it looked like all hope was gone
[1:18:51] what was it for it was time for the
[1:18:55] atmosphere the atmosphere was ready God
[1:18:57] knew what was going to happen so God
[1:19:00] allowed a man two thousand three
[1:19:02] thousand miles away when the atmosphere
[1:19:05] was ready to cause the children of God
[1:19:07] to believe he called him when a Ministry
[1:19:10] would have been at stake if brother Ron
[1:19:12] died
[1:19:14] but the atmosphere was ready for sister
[1:19:16] Connie and this church to receive a
[1:19:19] promise
[1:19:23] you might be sitting here and you might
[1:19:25] be perfectly well in your body and you
[1:19:27] can look over Isaiah 53 and you think
[1:19:30] well I don't need that right now but
[1:19:32] they're Hallelujah
[1:19:34] Serge of the Holy Ghost that is moving
[1:19:37] in here and you might be perfectly well
[1:19:39] but the Holy Ghost has looked all the
[1:19:42] way into your future and five years from
[1:19:45] now you might be sick as all by as
[1:19:47] anybody could ever be
[1:19:50] but Isaiah 53 is laying there for you
[1:19:55] whether you need it right now or whether
[1:19:57] you don't Isaiah 53 is in effect for you
[1:20:03] but when you get in your case when you
[1:20:06] get in a worse condition
[1:20:08] now I know I'm preaching above some
[1:20:10] young people right now because they feel
[1:20:12] invincible and they think that they'll
[1:20:13] never go through a crisis but when your
[1:20:15] back is hurting and you've got pain
[1:20:17] reaming throughout your body you need
[1:20:20] Isaiah 53.
[1:20:22] but when you get in the condition the
[1:20:25] condition has got to be ready for you to
[1:20:28] receive it
[1:20:30] so God is going to bring you through
[1:20:32] something to bring you to something that
[1:20:35] is greater than you can believe you've
[1:20:37] been battling to get here you've been
[1:20:39] battling just to be in the service but I
[1:20:41] want to tell you that the battle is
[1:20:44] worth the victory you've been through
[1:20:46] all hell but the conditions are right
[1:20:48] for you to receive heaven
[1:21:00] now notice that Jesus said when he was
[1:21:03] speaking to Nicodemus he said he said
[1:21:06] merely a man except a man be born again
[1:21:09] he cannot see the kingdom of God and in
[1:21:11] verse 5 he said except the man be born
[1:21:13] again of water and the spirit it cannot
[1:21:16] enter in to the kingdom of God so one
[1:21:19] cannot understand or enter into the Holy
[1:21:21] Ghost until a new birth takes place I
[1:21:24] don't know it's a paradox but it's very
[1:21:26] true tonight it's regular it's very old
[1:21:29] hair I'm very aware that there are
[1:21:32] children here tonight that are sitting
[1:21:34] here that are on the edge of a birth
[1:21:39] foreign
[1:21:40] I know you can't see it and I know you
[1:21:43] may not understand what I'm saying but
[1:21:44] there are children that are here there
[1:21:47] are people that are sitting here under
[1:21:48] the sound of my voice that Satan has
[1:21:51] been warring with but God has got them
[1:21:53] in a condition
[1:21:55] God has allowed them to go through some
[1:21:58] stuff to get them into a condition to
[1:22:01] believe
[1:22:02] that it ain't just for the pastor it
[1:22:04] ain't just for the Deacon but it's for
[1:22:06] me
[1:22:08] [Applause]
[1:22:11] if it was good enough for William
[1:22:13] Brown's Rebecca it's good enough for you
[1:22:15] Rebecca
[1:22:16] hallelujah it's good enough for every
[1:22:18] one of your little Rebecca's here
[1:22:20] tonight the Holy Ghost doesn't care what
[1:22:23] your last name is the Holy Ghost don't
[1:22:25] care what you've been through but he's
[1:22:27] brought you to this condition so that
[1:22:29] you can receive the supernatural seed
[1:22:37] you can't even understand the mind of
[1:22:39] God you can't even enter into the mind
[1:22:41] of God
[1:22:43] until the new birth one might say and
[1:22:46] can't understand the power of peace
[1:22:49] without the new birth one can't even
[1:22:51] understand Miracles without the new
[1:22:53] birth men will say that it's for days
[1:22:56] gone by without the new birth
[1:22:58] but if you're born of almighty God and
[1:23:01] if God is your father you're born into
[1:23:03] the family of God and you seek those
[1:23:05] things that pertain to God that's right
[1:23:07] there there you are your God shout your
[1:23:11] nature is God's nature then when somehow
[1:23:15] you hear them all say oh oh our church
[1:23:17] believes that the days of Miracles has
[1:23:19] passed how could you believe that the
[1:23:21] days of Miracles has passed when the
[1:23:23] very nature of God is in you when he is
[1:23:27] all together a miracle his nature is
[1:23:29] Miracle his habits are Miracle his whole
[1:23:31] being is Miracle how can you be anything
[1:23:34] else but a miracle
[1:23:36] foreign
[1:23:37] again
[1:23:39] you're a miracle you can't be nothing
[1:23:42] else
[1:23:43] when you have the worst day in your life
[1:23:46] when you're throwing up your guts you're
[1:23:49] a miracle
[1:23:50] when you can't see straight you're a
[1:23:52] miracle when your wife's mad at you
[1:23:54] you're a miracle when your boss is upset
[1:23:57] at you you're a miracle the very nature
[1:24:00] of almighty God is laying on the inside
[1:24:02] of you
[1:24:03] oh
[1:24:06] it's a paradox
[1:24:08] that God would want to dwell on somebody
[1:24:10] by the name of Jonathan Damron
[1:24:14] it's amazing it's a paradox that God
[1:24:17] would so love you that he gave himself
[1:24:22] now God ain't going to ask you to do
[1:24:23] something he's not willing to do himself
[1:24:27] he's not pressing you to believe him
[1:24:30] when he didn't have to believe his own
[1:24:32] word he had to
[1:24:34] he's not asking you to go out and have
[1:24:36] some kind of super Faith he's just
[1:24:38] wanting you to grab the little hyssop
[1:24:41] the little common faith and he's wanting
[1:24:44] you to take that little common faith and
[1:24:46] create
[1:24:48] and create such an atmosphere
[1:24:51] that the little children here or the
[1:24:53] oldest or the sickest person here
[1:24:55] because of your little faith God don't
[1:24:57] need your super duper faith God is
[1:25:00] already placed on the inside of you the
[1:25:02] gene seed of almighty God you are a word
[1:25:04] being you are a gene seed of almighty
[1:25:07] God I came from God I'm going back to
[1:25:10] God you recognize that you are here to
[1:25:13] manifest the very creation of almighty
[1:25:16] God
[1:25:16] [Applause]
[1:25:19] foreign
[1:25:24] was laying on the inside of Rahab
[1:25:31] when all the walls were stacked up
[1:25:33] against her
[1:25:36] when she's hosting this Lodge
[1:25:39] and she's inviting everybody in
[1:25:44] men that would ravish her
[1:25:46] men that would come in sneak in in the
[1:25:48] midday sneaking at midnight
[1:25:52] she's working in this place of lodging
[1:25:55] as a host as an Innkeeper
[1:25:59] but she's got a dual purpose
[1:26:04] and she's went through deep scars to be
[1:26:06] here
[1:26:08] but God didn't place you on the outside
[1:26:10] of the wall for no reason
[1:26:14] God didn't place you on the outside of
[1:26:16] the wall for no reason I want you to
[1:26:18] hear me God didn't place you where you
[1:26:20] are for no reason
[1:26:22] foreign
[1:26:23] you see because I want you to know that
[1:26:26] Rahab had something down on the inside
[1:26:28] of her that caused her what was she
[1:26:30] doing she was packing prophecy brother
[1:26:32] Chris
[1:26:36] can I go just a little bit deeper and so
[1:26:38] that you adults understand when she was
[1:26:41] taken by men she was packing prophecy
[1:26:45] when nobody thought that she would be in
[1:26:47] the picture she was packing prophecy
[1:26:49] when she was lodging all of these all of
[1:26:53] these events that had transpired in her
[1:26:55] life she was packing prophecy it may not
[1:26:58] look like it but Boaz is going to come
[1:27:00] forth it may not look like what you're
[1:27:03] looking at but God has got a condition
[1:27:04] ready for you to receive
[1:27:08] for you to receive your goal for you to
[1:27:11] receive the Redeemer
[1:27:14] I want you to know that where you are is
[1:27:16] not where God is going to leave you at
[1:27:18] because there is coming a message that's
[1:27:20] caused a shout in this camp that when
[1:27:24] the children of God when they are going
[1:27:26] around in the real reward is circling
[1:27:28] the camp that Rahab is getting ready to
[1:27:31] get out
[1:27:34] let me say when the messengers came by
[1:27:36] her way
[1:27:37] she lied for them
[1:27:42] she lied
[1:27:45] white lie black lie little red lie
[1:27:49] she lied
[1:27:51] but the prophecy that was on the inside
[1:27:53] of her was greater than all of her
[1:27:55] mistakes
[1:27:59] let me tell you when Jesus is setting in
[1:28:02] Simon's house and this woman is washing
[1:28:04] his feet let me tell you she was in the
[1:28:07] atmosphere to receive a blessing that no
[1:28:10] man could pour out upon her but she
[1:28:12] would be remembered throughout all of
[1:28:14] the history of the Bible that this woman
[1:28:17] was more righteous than Simon
[1:28:20] let me say this girl let me go a little
[1:28:22] bit further the denominations wouldn't
[1:28:25] wash his feet but there's a bride in
[1:28:27] this hour that has risen to receive him
[1:28:30] and because you've received him he's
[1:28:32] received you unto himself
[1:28:37] Rahab let me talk to you when all the
[1:28:40] walls are falling around you just get
[1:28:42] ready you're getting ready to walk out
[1:28:44] on the ashes
[1:28:46] you're going to walk out on the ashes
[1:28:51] [Applause]
[1:28:53] you imagine when all your friends are
[1:28:55] dying around you
[1:28:58] and the walls are crawl are crushed
[1:29:00] underneath of you but you just start
[1:29:02] walking out on the ashes
[1:29:06] you saw riding out on the walls of
[1:29:08] Jericho when the sin that once held you
[1:29:10] bound you start walking out on it when
[1:29:13] the demons that you had to address in
[1:29:15] your life when every Devon hell said you
[1:29:18] wouldn't make it they said you never
[1:29:20] produced it you start walking out on the
[1:29:22] ashes
[1:29:29] come on devil you know you ain't got
[1:29:31] enough to hold her you know you ain't
[1:29:33] got enough to hold him so back your
[1:29:35] dirty hands off of God's Property we are
[1:29:38] in the atmosphere the conditions are
[1:29:40] right the anointing is here the power is
[1:29:43] here
[1:29:44] let them loose
[1:29:46] let them loose let them loose let them
[1:29:50] loose Satan I charge you by the name of
[1:29:53] Jesus Christ take your hands off of
[1:29:56] God's Property
[1:29:58] [Applause]
[1:30:11] [Applause]
[1:30:17] I can point you to where he was
[1:30:21] I can point you to the tomb where he
[1:30:23] laid
[1:30:28] I can point you to where he moved in the
[1:30:29] past
[1:30:33] but our children
[1:30:35] don't need to pass God
[1:30:38] come on somebody
[1:30:40] last weekend was powerful
[1:30:44] but what you need is in this room
[1:30:48] I can point you back to the Luther h i
[1:30:51] can point you back to where he went up
[1:30:53] there and he nailed the 95 pieces on a
[1:30:55] on a Roman wall I can punch you up there
[1:30:58] but the mechanics of Luther will never
[1:31:00] work I can point you back to where
[1:31:02] Wesley was a man of God and he prayed
[1:31:05] and his horse got sick he prayed for his
[1:31:07] horse he got back on his horse and he
[1:31:10] rode it back then he began to preach all
[1:31:12] the way back in them Hills
[1:31:14] but the mechanics of Wesley will not
[1:31:16] work I can point you back to California
[1:31:18] I can point you back to Azusa Street I
[1:31:21] can tell you about the Miracles that
[1:31:23] they had back there how did a blind man
[1:31:25] would appear and begin to call on the
[1:31:27] name of the Lord and there was a
[1:31:28] restoration of gifts but the mechanics
[1:31:31] of that will never get you out of
[1:31:32] laodicea but what we need is the
[1:31:35] Dynamics of the message of the hour to
[1:31:38] roll over our soul and charge us and
[1:31:41] challenge us to believe and take us out
[1:31:43] of this whole world
[1:31:46] foreign
[1:31:54] and when they come looking for the Welsh
[1:31:55] Revival they were looking for where it
[1:31:57] was at you remember when they went over
[1:32:00] there they went over there we were
[1:32:01] looking for a layer of the wealth
[1:32:02] survival was at
[1:32:04] where's it at and there was a little
[1:32:06] policeman out there
[1:32:09] policeman out there throwing his whistle
[1:32:11] around twirling I said man can you point
[1:32:14] us to the wealth's Revival he said
[1:32:15] you're looking at it
[1:32:17] where's the bride's Revival at Point at
[1:32:20] your neighbor said you're looking at it
[1:32:24] what William Bradham was looking for you
[1:32:26] have arrived what every devil has been
[1:32:29] scared of you are here
[1:32:32] you're not just a bunch of weaklings
[1:32:34] you're not a bunch of school girls
[1:32:35] you're not a people that don't know who
[1:32:37] you are you know exactly who you are and
[1:32:40] the sons of God are going to walk out
[1:32:42] and take the very power
[1:32:52] do you believe him
[1:32:54] okay
[1:32:56] when a doctor brings in bad news
[1:32:58] do you trust him
[1:33:02] when you're having struggles
[1:33:04] do you believe him
[1:33:06] you see the message will put you in a
[1:33:08] position to receive
[1:33:13] you see a few weeks ago
[1:33:16] was my little daughter Ally's birthday
[1:33:20] turn eight years old
[1:33:23] man you talking about a kid she's all
[1:33:24] kid
[1:33:27] she's being a female body
[1:33:29] I'm glad she took after the looks of her
[1:33:31] mama
[1:33:33] but let me tell you
[1:33:35] she was excited for her birthday before
[1:33:37] her birthday ever rode around
[1:33:41] she was excited two weeks after her
[1:33:43] birthday
[1:33:46] she had gifts coming in from her Grandpa
[1:33:48] and her Grandpa I can't call them that
[1:33:50] Bella
[1:33:52] they were coming in from different
[1:33:53] places
[1:33:55] and she was under great anticipation for
[1:33:56] these gifts to come in
[1:33:58] and man let me tell you when she got
[1:34:00] them she was the most elated person and
[1:34:01] she wanted to share with him with you
[1:34:03] she wanted to play with you she wanted
[1:34:05] you to see it
[1:34:07] but what caused that anticipation
[1:34:10] I did
[1:34:12] she'd have never known it was her
[1:34:13] birthday unless I told her
[1:34:17] unless her mama would have said on this
[1:34:18] day on January the 7th it's going to be
[1:34:21] your birthday
[1:34:23] and when she found out it was her
[1:34:25] birthday
[1:34:26] you know as a child sometimes you just
[1:34:28] don't understand the calendar
[1:34:35] what day is it oh it's Saturday we got
[1:34:37] to go to church
[1:34:38] that's that day
[1:34:40] some people just still don't understand
[1:34:41] that
[1:34:46] I told you not to go there oh
[1:34:52] sorry
[1:34:54] sorry I just slipped out
[1:34:57] but the reason why she was so elated
[1:35:00] about her birthday was because somebody
[1:35:01] told it it was her birthday
[1:35:03] the reason why you're so elated that
[1:35:06] there's going to be a Rapture is because
[1:35:08] somebody told you about it and if nobody
[1:35:10] would have told you about it you'd have
[1:35:12] never been excited about it but because
[1:35:14] Malachi 4 lined up with what Paul said
[1:35:17] all the way back there in the book of
[1:35:19] Thessalonians it's caused an excitement
[1:35:21] on the inside of you let me tell you
[1:35:24] it's about to be all of our birthdays
[1:35:27] where we change from this Mortal to that
[1:35:30] immortality
[1:35:32] and there ain't one devil that can stop
[1:35:34] our Elation there ain't one person that
[1:35:36] can stop us from getting happen there
[1:35:39] ain't one devil that can stop us from
[1:35:41] getting excited
[1:35:48] you forgive me if I act like this all
[1:35:51] the time but I'm happy
[1:35:53] I'm excited something's about to change
[1:35:57] something's about to move over my body
[1:36:02] the atmosphere is here for it the
[1:36:04] Supernatural is here
[1:36:19] but God put something on the inside of
[1:36:21] your brother Timmy to hunger for it
[1:36:24] to see the pillar of fire working in
[1:36:27] your family
[1:36:30] not just a roll over your wife and
[1:36:33] yourselves family over yourselves but to
[1:36:36] watch it roll over your children
[1:36:40] what good is this if we don't want to
[1:36:42] share it with somebody else
[1:36:52] he had better been under great
[1:36:54] anticipation
[1:36:56] foreign
[1:36:57] and it never comes
[1:37:03] you can imagine Ali
[1:37:05] as excited she was
[1:37:08] I tell her you're never going to have
[1:37:10] another one you're never going to don't
[1:37:11] be excited about it no more your things
[1:37:13] are not it's not true baby
[1:37:17] you imagine
[1:37:19] you can sit there and act like you don't
[1:37:21] get excited about your birthday
[1:37:23] but as for me in my house
[1:37:32] I'm trying to get you good and relaxed
[1:37:34] real quick here
[1:37:36] is it working
[1:37:38] all right
[1:37:41] you imagine for the anticipation that it
[1:37:43] never comes
[1:37:45] you can imagine Sarah waiting every 28
[1:37:48] days
[1:37:51] and it don't show up
[1:37:55] and she goes all the way through
[1:37:56] menopause
[1:37:58] and it don't show up
[1:38:02] and she hears
[1:38:03] the crowd mocking her
[1:38:07] mocking her husband mocking her
[1:38:12] it'll never happen
[1:38:17] this is what happened
[1:38:22] when Hannah
[1:38:23] is going through her greatest of Trials
[1:38:29] panaya
[1:38:30] the Scriptures foretail it doesn't tell
[1:38:33] us every everyone that she had
[1:38:36] but when elkana begins to talk to her he
[1:38:39] said am I not greater to you than ten
[1:38:41] Sons
[1:38:42] can you imagine that panaya is carrying
[1:38:45] these these children
[1:38:48] she's carrying them
[1:38:50] she's watching them
[1:38:53] but she like Leah
[1:38:58] like Leah and her sister
[1:39:01] there was a love hate
[1:39:03] because it looked like God had shut up
[1:39:07] her home
[1:39:13] things aren't happening for you
[1:39:16] it looks like the supernatural isn't
[1:39:18] visiting your home and it looks like
[1:39:20] it's on it's looking like it's on this
[1:39:22] brother and it looks like it's on this
[1:39:23] sister but when is it coming to my house
[1:39:28] I've been hungering for it too
[1:39:32] you don't know what it's like going up
[1:39:34] to the sacrifice going up there to the
[1:39:37] Feast of sacrifice and panaya is in my
[1:39:40] ear the whole time saying you can't have
[1:39:42] the Holy Ghost you can't speak in
[1:39:44] tongues you can't have the Holy Ghost
[1:39:46] you can't have a move of God in your
[1:39:48] life you'll never produce a Rapture
[1:39:50] you'll never be able to live up to
[1:39:52] message status you'll never be able to
[1:39:54] listen to William Branham and get past
[1:39:56] all of your circumstances of life you
[1:39:59] don't know what it's like to listen to
[1:40:01] panea's voice in your ear year after
[1:40:03] year
[1:40:05] foreign
[1:40:07] listening to panaya speak to you in this
[1:40:11] manner mocking you
[1:40:14] as Elkin
[1:40:15] shows you his love
[1:40:17] the Bible said that he gave her a worthy
[1:40:20] portion
[1:40:22] but she wanted something greater than
[1:40:25] what man could give her
[1:40:28] let me say this she didn't want what
[1:40:30] elkanah could give her she wanted what
[1:40:33] God could give her
[1:40:35] I don't want what the Creeds can give us
[1:40:37] I don't want what the deeds and the
[1:40:39] actions of of men of days gone by can
[1:40:42] give us I want what God can give us
[1:40:45] [Applause]
[1:40:54] you're never going to get over your
[1:40:56] barrenness
[1:40:58] you're never going to get over it let me
[1:41:00] tell you every time you go to Shiloh
[1:41:03] it's a reminder
[1:41:05] that you can never take into the Feast
[1:41:07] of sacrifice because when you go to
[1:41:10] studying out the Book of Numbers I
[1:41:11] believe in chapter 26 that you could not
[1:41:13] come before him at the Feast of
[1:41:16] sacrifice in mourning and every single
[1:41:18] time Hannah came before the Lord at
[1:41:20] Shiloh she did not even eat her
[1:41:23] countenance was said
[1:41:27] because she wanted this one thing
[1:41:30] you ever wanted something so bad
[1:41:34] you can't hardly eat
[1:41:37] that you go through the agonies of pain
[1:41:39] because you just can't find that inner
[1:41:42] peace
[1:41:46] and your husband
[1:41:48] and shower you with all kinds of
[1:41:49] blessings but yet you want that one
[1:41:52] thing
[1:41:55] and another cycle comes
[1:41:57] and another cycle comes
[1:42:00] empanadas in your ear
[1:42:05] you'll not receive it Esther you will
[1:42:09] not receive it
[1:42:10] Hannah you're not going to receive that
[1:42:12] you're not going to you're not going to
[1:42:14] be able to produce that
[1:42:15] don't worry
[1:42:17] this ain't up to you
[1:42:20] God has brought you to this condition
[1:42:23] to receive
[1:42:27] d
[1:42:30] and what God has joined together let no
[1:42:32] man put us under
[1:42:34] what's God been doing in this service
[1:42:36] he's been bringing you word on top of
[1:42:39] words Sail on top of sale Creator in an
[1:42:41] atmosphere for you to believe
[1:42:44] and Hannah was brought into a condition
[1:42:46] that when she got up there and she heard
[1:42:50] all of these things that she got before
[1:42:52] the altar of the Lord now she couldn't
[1:42:54] partake like everybody else does at the
[1:42:56] Feast of sacrifice because she couldn't
[1:42:58] even eat because the pain on the inside
[1:43:01] of her was showing on the outside
[1:43:05] and panaya was happy at her Agony banaya
[1:43:10] was enthused that she was creating such
[1:43:13] a misery she had taunted her with her
[1:43:15] language so much
[1:43:20] foreign
[1:43:34] this is going to be your last time
[1:43:38] let this be your last time you mocked me
[1:43:40] let us be the last service you deal with
[1:43:42] depression let this be the last service
[1:43:45] that you deal with a battle of anxiety
[1:43:48] that you're never going to be good
[1:43:50] enough that you're battling all of these
[1:43:51] scars in your family panaya this is your
[1:43:54] last service talk to me no more whisper
[1:43:57] in my ear no more I'm going before the
[1:44:00] Lord
[1:44:01] I'm gonna have a talk with almighty God
[1:44:05] panaya can't produce this how can I can
[1:44:08] produce this but I'm going to somebody
[1:44:10] bigger
[1:44:12] you can run out of gas you can run out
[1:44:15] of food you can run out of energy you
[1:44:17] can run out of money but God says I'm
[1:44:19] bigger than all your problems I'm bigger
[1:44:21] than your situations when you run out I
[1:44:24] never fail when you give up I keep going
[1:44:29] [Applause]
[1:44:36] oh
[1:44:38] Hannah
[1:44:40] do you hear me talking to you
[1:44:43] do you hear me talking to you Hannah you
[1:44:46] are getting ready to bring forth and
[1:44:48] it's not going to be by your own Deeds
[1:44:56] watch
[1:44:58] a Believer is one who acts on the word
[1:45:00] of God
[1:45:01] and God never tells us to do something
[1:45:03] that we cannot do
[1:45:05] Faith is doing what God tells us to do
[1:45:07] then expecting God to do what he tells
[1:45:09] us he will do Noah built the ark and God
[1:45:13] flooded the Earth Moses stretched out
[1:45:15] the rod and God parted the Seas Joshua
