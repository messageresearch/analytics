father in the right way father but we know God that the best way to save is we thank you for your life we thank you for your love we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your grace Lord It's Your Presence that we feel here tonight that that makes us feel at home because this world is definitely not our home and Le osy has its way of making us feel so sticky but Lord your presence washes us and makes us clean Lord one more time you have done it again in Lord where you have allowed us to enter into your shika Glory father to pull the veil behind us and know that the rest of the world really don't matter the things out there really don't matter but what matters is in this room and it's you father Lord I pray father for every person that would hear this tonight may they understand Lord that you're the most key part to every one of our Lives brother Brandon would say you're the principal theme of all the Bible you're the principal theme of our life father without you nothing matters father so father we press forward into this life knowing that you will never leave us nor forsake us and father tonight we commit this service into your hands Lord you see all the doings of Life father we just ask Lord for a special moment tonight in your presence Lord we surrender our life to you and I pray God you bless your word tonight and may it find its resting place in our heart so we commit this service into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen isn't it wonderful to be able to feel the presence of the Lord amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening I'd like to look over in the book of Isaiah chapter 53 Isaiah chapter 53 in John chapter n and and as you're aware there'll be no service tomorrow and uh we thank you for cooperating with us we just feel as a church body that we need to make a representation to the Reagan and Parker family and and they've asked our pastor to be a part of part of the funeral there and we know that we didn't get to see the healing that we all desired for our sister Erica but she got the healing she got the healing perfect perfect healing and also want to be remembering the brandom family with brother Billy Paul passing away and we see here that our loved ones are passing beyond the the veil and we know that God is coming and picking them up one by one we know that it isn't uh too much longer he's going to come and catch his waiting Bri away and Amen brother brandham says it like this in the church age book he said the angels are there waiting breathlessly for our arrival and to think that they're waiting there for us and to know that here we are we feel so sorry we you know for ourselves we hated to see sister Erica pass the way she did but I'd say that she's the one that feels sorry for us today and you know if she could encourage us I'd say that she's a part of that cloud of witnesses that is encouraging us to press the battle with everything that's within us so so just be remembering the the Reagan and Parker family there and we know that a void of a mother can't easily be filled but we know that Jesus heals every one of our our hearts amen amen so we have one service here this weekend and so I'm going to ask that you put everything that you've got into this service tonight and and I believe the Lord's got something in store for us here tonight Isaiah chapter 53 and verse one and the Bible said who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord uh of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he no form nor cess and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed John chapter 9 and verse 1 and the Bible says here that as Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind and Jesus answered neither hath this man sined nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work and as long as I am in the world I am the light of the world when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay out of the spittle and he Anointed The Eyes of the blind man with the clay and said unto him go wash in the pool of Shalom which is by interpretation sent he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing may God bless his word you may be seated here tonight in the presence of the Lord I would like to speak to you tonight A a thought that that the Lord laid on my heart on Monday morning on exposing exposing the flaw exposing the flaw the word flaw it means it means a breach or a crack it is a defect that is made by breaking or splitting a gap or a fissure as we would say it's a flaw in a piece of China or a dish or a glass or or it could be a flaw in the in the drywall there and we know what Expos it means means to means to set before the public it means to disclose or to uncover it means to make bear to remove from anything that guards it and protects it and brother brandham said in the revelation of the Jesus Christ in the church age book he said now the Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling and he said this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculptor unveiling his work of Statuary exposed in it to the onlooker it is an uncovering or a revealing what was previously hidden when so when we recognize that when Revelation strikes it unveils what was previously hidden and when brother brandham goes into the message of the Masterpiece he goes in there and he starts talking about a place that he's that he was there at Forest Lawn and he begin to he begin to look at the artwork that was there there at Forest Lawn he be to talk about different pieces of glass and different artwork he said God is in art and and brother brandham said that there he he said what what caught my mind or what caught my attention the most in Forest Lawn he said it was Michaelangelo sculpture of Moses and he said that he said that he had spent all of that time he spent countless years working on that sculpture just to get it exactly right he took this piece of of rock and he took it and and he worked on it tirelessly and he he worked on it through the nights and throughout the years and brother brandham said that after he had spent all that time for years and years to make this he said after he got under the influence of seeing fulfilled what he had seen in his heart and in his vision and desired to see he said it was and it and it was completed he said and when it was completed he was so inspired till he thought his own Masterpiece should speak back to him and he struck it across the leg and hollered speak and it made a flaw on it and it put a flaw on the image he said but to to me the flaw was what made it the Masterpiece we got a little bit of a ring here Brothers he said to me what made the flaw was to me what the flaw was what made it the Masterpiece to think that tonight that the flaw is what made Michelangelo's uh Mo of Moses the flaw was what made it the Masterpiece now brother brandom said now he said that's in my own opinion he said when he struck that when when Michelangelo Struck it he said to to me he said in my opinion he said that made it the Masterpiece you see there might be other people that had different thoughts of why it was a masterpiece but William brandham as a prophet speaking to us he said in my opinion he said it was the flaw that made the Masterpiece and to me it what is so amazing is that the flaw came after he matched the very image of what Michelangelo had in his mind that when he when he saw what he had held there in his mind for all of those years and looking at this thinking about it the inspiration that struck his mind as an artist to be able to bring it out to think that the flaw came after the image had met met met in his mind and then he therefore said speak to it you see it was the inspiration of seeing what he had had set there in his mind that was perfectly before him and to think that tonight as as the children of the most high God to think that tonight that that we have a promise here tonight that God has said that he would never leave us and that he would never forsake us but we know this that we have an aggressive enemy that is constantly at war with the saints of God because Satan knows that God cannot lie and that God is the author of all truth and that he realizes that there he was all the way back there in the Garden of Eden and he heard God talking about a seed that was going to come that God had made a promise that there would be a woman's seed and that he would bruise the head of the serpent and so Satan had been looking for that promised seed for all of those years and he constantly had watched for that seed he he'd watched for that woman seed to come you see because Satan knew that that seed would expose Satan's plans it would expose that there was a flaw in Satan's plans because he knew without that woman's seed that the serpent the Serpent's head would not be br Bruce so Satan was constantly watching for the woman's seed to come and to think that as we just draw a drama just for a moment that God that there he had it in his mind to create himself an Eden for his children to live in that God thought of these great things as a as a great sculpture as a great sculptor he he set out these things he had them in his mind he had a vision of what he was going to be brother brandham would say he said he had attributes to be a father attributes to be a Healer he said but he couldn't do that as the great God up in heaven he said so he had to create a man so he had to create all of these different elements of the world that we understand so God has all of these things as they're laid out in his mind and he brings them into manifestation that God then allows his child Adam to come into come into manifestation and he trust Adam so much that he allows him to control the things that God has created he he trust him so much that he allows his children to speak to the atmospheres like he spoke to the atmospheres he trust Adam and Eve so much that he allows them to decorate the Eden the way that they want it because they God has is setting them up and notice what they were operating in they were operating in the office of a son and daughter of God brother random would say it like this they were operating as amateur Gods but to think that Satan in his slick ways he slipped in and persuaded Eve to disbelieve the word of God to think that this was the only fortification that they had there in Eden was the word of God but Satan was so slicking away that he slipped in there that he made her disbelieve the word of God what was he trying to do he was trying to show her that she did not have full control he was trying to show her that she had not fully tasted of all that was laying there in the Garden of Eden so he tried to expose her to the tree of knowledge to make her come to an understanding that she did not fully have he was trying to put it in her mind to make a reason that she didn't have full control you see what Satan was wanting to do to Eve he was trying to point out an imperfection in her life as Humanity he was trying to show her that there was more for her but God had put restraints around it because God had put some things there but Satan on the backside of it was trying to cause a flaw and notice what it did because of her unbelief it caused a flaw what did it do it caused a Chasm to be to be caused the flaw to be com into into existence and there we recognize that in the Garden of Eden as soon as man had realized that he had sin that instead of running to God and saying God I'm sorry I fail I made a mistake I I I made a mistake I I I did wrong but instead of that what did he do he went out and he made himself a homemade religion instead instead of going to God say God I'm sorry I failed you I got a flaw in my inheritance I got a flaw in my possession but instead of that he made himself a homemade religion and we know good and well that a homemade religion will never work a man-made religion will never work is that right is that right notice brother random said that that homemade religion worked as long as they were not in the presence of almighty God but how can you escape the presence of the all knowing god that they could not Escape it but you see when God come walking down in the cool of the Eden like he had always done Adam knew that something was wrong he knew that something was wrong but instead of uncovering it he tried to cover his sin and his figle his figleaf religion didn't do him no good so God being a God that was rich in Mercy he made himself a substitute he made him a covering what was the covering it was the covering of the blood of Jesus of the blood of the Lamb that allowed them to be in Fellowship not in the way that they once was in the Garden of Eden but now they could actually have a fellowship because of the Fall there was no Fellowship but God was in the his idea was to restore the fellowship the fellowship that he had in his mind the fellowship that he really wanted the fellowship that he created Adam for God was restoring that you see that's what brother random would say the Masterpiece he said God is not the kind of art artist that would allow his greatest Masterpiece to lay their face down on the ground he said when he saw it Fallen he began to build it to make it and to bring it right back up again you see that's what makes God God to me is that he's so much God he's so big there is nobody that can explain how big he is but he's so great that he can humble himself and come to little old me but to think that there they were they were fortified by the word of God brother BR would saying it like this he said they were barricaded by the very word of God to think that tonight that you're barricaded by the word of God but what did Sin do it brought in a castle but the blood was a substitute it was a substitute of the blood that made for them an access because of the chasm that had been brought because of sin but you notice that I'm just going to jump real quick but you notice that when Jesus starts talking about about the Rich Young Ruler in Luke chapter 16 he starts talking about the Rich Young Ruler that there's two people in the picture when Jesus starts talking about Lazarus which was a beggar and he starts talking about the Rich Young Ruler that this one had much in his life but this one didn't have anything in his life but they both go beyond they both die but notice that when when when notice the scene that Jesus is bringing before us that there he begins to set it out and he says to him he said and he begins to look at it and there the Rich Young Ruler his eyes are looking over there and he sees Lazarus there in the bosom of Abraham and here the richr ruler he simply requests Lord let Lazarus come and take of the water and put it on my tongue for this this heat these Flames they're tormenting me but notice what the Bible said that Jesus said that Abraham said I cannot come to you and you cannot come to me because there's a great Gulf between you and I brother brandom said right there put a silence to Purgatory right there that there was nobody that could pay for your sin once they'd already went there once they done they'd under went to the Grave there was nobody that could go in there and pay a Catholic priest to get them back out of that Purgatory but notice what Abraham said to the Rich Young Ruler because you didn't receive God's provided weight because you wasn't willing willing to give it all up in this life what did he have he had the riches of life he had Potentials in this life but he wasn't willing to surrender it all to him he wasn't really you know he was wasn't really willing to give it all up for him to come fully and surrender him what did Satan do he robbed the Rich Young Ruler of the greatest opportunity that he had in his life that's exactly what Satan does to our young people he tries to rob them of the greatest opportunities that they've ever had in their life and that's access to the blood of Jesus Christ he tries to offer them some other way of living or some easy living or some easy believism of just anybody confess Jesus and all of these things what does he do he robs them he robs him of the greatest opportunity that they ever could have but to have a real surrender there's got to be a death and the Rich Young Ruler was not willing to completely die out but notice what the Young Ruler said let Lazarus go from the grave and go back there and testify to my five brothers let him go back there and testify to him don't you come down here don't you go beyond this Castle don't you go there but Abraham said no that's why they got the prophets that's why they got Moses notice what Abraham is telling him that there is an authority in the land to keep them from this don't you understand that that's what the word is it is the authority in the land to keep you from the chasm of sin that the word is a Chasm that you have need of to keep you from the bondage of hell he said not even if one came from the grave and went back there and talked to them not even that would persuade them he said if they he said not even that he said if they won't hear the prophets he said they won't hear one from the dead but I want you to know that if you can take this word if you can take this promise it'll expose every secret sin in your life it'll destroy Satan it'll annihilate his kingdom it'll bring healing to your body it'll bring joy to your soul if you can take this kind of word it'll bring peace to you like a river if you can take this word and let it cross your life let it roll across you if you can take this word it'll destroy every antic that Satan's got against you the word is everything that you have need of in this life amen now notice what brother random said he said have you ever noticed how Satan hates two books of the Bible I know you know this but I want you to hear the perspective I want you to stay in line with it tonight he said have you ever noticed how Satan hates two books of the Bible through though through Le liberal theologians and pseudo scientists he is always attacking the Book of Genesis and the Book of Revelations he said in both of these books we find Satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction he said that is why he attacks them he hates to be exposed and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is he said Jesus said about Satan he has no part in me and I have no part in him and the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word but when the church disbelieves and believes when the church disbelieves Satan and believes a spirit of Revelation the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her when the church disbelieves Satan I want you to know right there that is the flaw in Satan's plan it's when the church disbelieves Satan every plan that he's got against you of sending you to a premature grave when you disbelieve Satan it's the flaw to its plan when you choose to turn down the devil's lie it is a flaw in Satan's plan Satan has planned out against you for 6,000 years but when you disbelieve him and you accept what the spirit has said about you Hallelujah when you accept the spiritual Revelation can I quote a prophet to you when you receive the spirit's Revelation the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you slap your neighbor don't slap them but tell them to wake up when you receive the spirit's Revelation the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you do you realize how powerful that your belief is do you realize how powerful your amen is do you realize how powerful your agreeance is is when you disbelieve Satan but you believe God it puts you in line for a miracle I want you to know there's nothing outside of the word of God that you have need of for a miracle but to believe all you have to do is only believe Hallelujah you say well I don't believe Satan but you have allowed him to lead you to believe that you're no good you've allowed him to lead you to believe that you're not worthy enough you're not good enough you can't be healed you can't be delivered that the message don't work no more it's well I don't believe Satan but you allow him to trick you into thinking that you've got to deal with anxiety for the rest of your life well I don't believe Satan I don't believe his lies oh but when he puts a headache on you and he puts a feeling in your body and automatically he makes you think it's cancer you say well I don't believe Satan but you let you let one night slip by where you can't get in the presence of God and you feel like you're lost and you start believing the devil's lie you've allowed you've allowed sat to lie to you you've allowed Satan to tell you all kinds of things but I want you to know that God has told me opposite I am worthy I am good enough I can be healed I can be delivered I can be set free I am for the Rapture I am the message brother said I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of people when Satan knows that he's going to be exposed he said now it isn't that the people it isn't the people that I'm talking about he said it is that Satan has got a hold of them in their lives through sin and indifference and disease he said but you should see their faces that Satan knows he's going to be exposed and the most peculiar change comes over the people's countenance he said Satan is afraid he knows that the spirit of God is about to let the people know his Works he said that's why he hates meetings these meetings so much he said when names are called and diseases are revealed Satan hates it don't you see that it's the same way tonight under the fold Ministry that when when a man of God begins to preach the word of God and he starts calling out diseases and the word of God begins to discern the very thoughts and the intents of the heart what is it Satan gets afraid because he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she will be an invincible Army don't you understand that even though the prophet is not here that God ain't God's angel is here to direct the word to make sure that it doesn't miss its spot well Glory now notice what the Bible said in Ephesians 3 and9 to make all men let's say that together make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning which from from which which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that that now under the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord so the purpose of this was to unveil it was to uncover it was to expose to every throne and to every rank of Angels and Demons of God's full riches and his wisdom towards you so The Fellowship of the mystery is to accept God's provided way and it is the only way to bridge the flaw every one of you here have flaws in your life and Satan Satan is waiting for the moment to expose your flaw if Satan could he would expose your flaw publicly before everybody here aren't you glad he can't but that's what he's looking for he's looking to expose the flaw of your of your Humanity but notice the only way to bridge the gap is to accept God's provided way now notice what brother random said and God hiding himself in in in Simplicity he said when man sinned he separated himself from God and crossed the great Chasm and put himself in death on this side and he's left there's no way back exactly there's no way for him to get back but then when he did you see you couldn't get back you couldn't get back on that side of the castle I want you to get a get a good visual of this tonight that you because of the fa that death and man was taken the same side on this side it's death on this side on this side it's death but on this side it's life you see you couldn't get back there was a Chasm between it that's what brother brandom said he said but God accepted a substitute which was a lamb or a goat or sheep or something for blood he said which Abel spoke of on the other side of the castle he said on that side he's a Son of God he's an offspring from God he's an inheritance of the earth he can control nature he can speak into existence why he's a Creator himself on the he's an offspring of God so on this side he has separated himself do you recognize if you're outside of the blood that you are on the side of death but on this side you are over here operating Under full Authority as a son and daughter of God that all the nature is waiting for the moment to for you to operate but because of the Fall there was a Chasm that was put there notice this he said but when he crossed he separated his sunship when he cross that Chasm he separated his sunship he's a sinner by Nature he's under the hands and minion of Satan and God took a sacrifice a chemical of the blood but the blood of bulls and goats did not divorce it it only covered sin it only covered sin he would say it like this he said if I've got a red spot on my hand and I cover with white the red spot's still there he said but God sent down from heaven a bleach for sin it was the blood of his own son that when I confess sin drops into God's bleach you try to find it again you take one of these little girls you take one of these prostitutes out there on the street and God turned them into a saint you tell me when they confess their sin try to find it again Satan would do all of his power to expose the flaw but the blood made away so that Satan cannot expose your flaws woo Glory he said the coloring of sin notice the coloring of sin goes back through the mediators and down through time until it hits the accuser Satan and lays on him to the day of judgment don't you understand why Satan does not want you confessing your sin and dropping it in the blood of Jesus Christ bleach because when you confess your sin when you confess you're not worthy when you you confess your faults when you confess you're not when you confess you've got flaws when you confess you're a human it goes back on Satan that's why Satan wants to keep you from praise that's why God that's why Satan wants to keep you from prayer that's why Satan wants to keep you from reading your Bible because the stronger you get the more you confess your sin the stronger the Heap of mountain of sin that is put upon [Applause] Satan don't you see the key element of the picture that if you confess your sin your sins are gone the moment how quick does it take brother Andrew let me show you how quick it takes brother brandom's in a prayer line he's dealing with he's dealing with patience and brother Brandon makes makes it very clear he said before you come into this prayer line you deal with your sin because if you don't get it dealt with it will get exposed here and this sister hears this and she steps out of line bows her head and says God forgive me steps back in line and walks before a prophet and she's found sinless how quick does does it take brother Andrew as soon as you can repent it's over Hallelujah you ain't got to beat yourself you ain't got to worry yourself you ain't got to go through life beating yourself trying to make yourself a Christian one time in the presence of the blood makes you white as snow well blessed be the name of the Lord every son and daughter of God knows what it's like to experience the freedom from sin but too many times people are not willing to give out the same Mercy that they retained oh come on somebody everybody's always quick to point out somebody else's fls or somebody else's mistakes but they dare not want their own flaws may put it into the public give the same Mercy that you want it doesn't matter who your last name is it doesn't matter what church you came from it doesn't matter where you are the blood is for every black man white man yellow man Red Man the blood is for every human human that sits here hallelujah well I fail but the blood says I'm perfect Satan says I can't get up but the blood Hallelujah the blood speaks of better [Music] things I know you got a whole lot of things that's laying there in your family history that you could talk about but this Blood talks a whole lot better the blood speaks of better things there's a voice behind the blood what was it when Cain killed Abel he said I hear the voice of thy brother there's blood calling out now if Abel's blood has that much voice behind it how much more does the voice of the blood of Jesus Christ speak out and speak better things Hallelujah line up all your Devils line up every one of them line up all your mistakes line up all your flaws but I remember I remember falling but God don't but I remember sinning but God don't now let me ask you something whose memory do you want let me tell you something there's one thing I'm not gifted in a whole lot of ways but I am gifted in this way I never forget anything I'm like an elephant kind of like my mama we got a mind on us she ain't an elephant in that way but she's got the Lord have mercy that took a PL but but if you know the story about elephants elephants never forget I never forget anything it gets spoke to me one time I can remember it I don't want my memory that's right I don't want my memory I don't want my memory because my memory remembers mistakes my memory remembers faults my memory remembers when maybe you was out there my memory remembers maybe when you did me wrong but even if I forgive you I can still remember it but the power of God's memory he no longer remembers it it's not in his mind it's not in his mind it's not in his plan so when Satan says he's going to expose you say I take God's mind I take God's plan hallelujah hallelujah it was a gasm but you remember when brother Brandon when brother Brandon he's there in the seals and he said now I'm no longer going to address you as a church but I'm going to address you as a bride of Jesus Christ notice what he is doing I'm not going to address you as a church but I'm going to dress you as a bride because notice if you'll notice the language of the Prophet you see on that side of the seals the vision of the word showed a bridge but on this side of the seals the vision of the word shows that the CM is completely done away with let me say this to you that all the questions of life that Jesus is the answer when William Brandon preaches the message why in 1963 on the backside of the seals he said the your confessed sin he said completely does a away with the chasm you see you're not like the rest of the world that you can't get to God and God can't get to you the bridge has been bridged by the blood of Jesus Christ well somebody praise the Lord there is no more CM there is no Bridge what of it preacher I'm saying this that Jesus match the vision that God had before the foundation of the world surely if man has the ability to draw out things in his mind God has the ability and the Bible said that that the lamb was slain before you ever sinned that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and that that the Bible would tell us that when the vision of God came into manifestation and Jesus matched the inspiration of God the Bible said in John chapter 19 that when the Roman soldier stuck his spear in his side what elements came out of it water and blood notice when you read all of John chapter 19 you'll notice that all the elements that that that that contribute to the New Birth come out in John chapter 19 water blood and the spirit when you read 1 John 5 and8 that this is that that these three agree in one it's water blood in spirit what is it it constitutes the new birth what happen happened in the Garden of Eden what happened God caused a deep sleep to come upon Adam and he took out of the side of Adam a rib and out of that side he brought forth his wife what happened to Calvary he matched the vision of almighty God he matched the vision of what he had in his mind and at Calvary that's why Paul would say in Galatians 2 and 20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless yet not I but Christ that lives Within me I am co- crucified with him I'm identified with him in his death I'm identified with him in his Buel hallu Hallelujah he matched what God had in his mind hallelujah what happened to what happened to Calvary what happened in Eden he found himself a bride what happened to Calvary he took himself as bride out there you are water blood and spirit the only way that you cannot be identified in this is if the token is not applied to your life the only way that you are not a part of the master is if the token is not applied hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah you imagine you imagine how God feels 2,000 years ago he waited for this moment he waited for this moment he was in David but David was not his fullness he was in Moses but Moses was not his fullness he was in Abraham but Abraham was not his fullness he was in all the prophets you can see Christ and all the prophets and the closest one there was was Joseph he matched him perfectly it matched them perfectly imagine as God is drawing us out brother Chris he's he's got the vision in his mind of Christ that all of these pieces are come together and he finally sees his vision manifested that when Jesus is up there on Mount Transfiguration what did he say this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell what was it Michelangelo could look at his inspiration he could see his vision manifested and he could cry speak back to it he could cry speak to it but he couldn't speak back to him but the vision of Christ had a voice and it could speak what was it speaking of that there was a people what was Jesus coming for he did not come here for himself he came here for you Hallelujah the vision could speak hallelujah hallelujah the vision could speak to him now I'm getting ahead of myself but do you realize how God anticipated for that but do you realize how God has anticipated 2,000 years ago through seven Church ages through the castle through the bridging through the breach that now God has a lady that he anticipated her coming she's got full Authority she's Bor him upon paone life of his life word of his word power of his power she matches my vision hallelujah what was it calvary Calvary produce the Masterpiece hallelujah hallelujah you don't have to do it on your own you don't have to fight your battles you don't have to be downtrodden he gave you purpose he gave you life he gave you hope he gave you peace I am your everything I am your all in all I Am The Offspring and the root of David I am Alpha I am Omega but when you go to reading John chapter 9 and you see this you see this as it's unfolding that the blind man has laid there all those years you imagine Jesus's closest friend they're walking with him and they pass by him on the way and I said now who sinned who sinned ain't it amazing that Humanity always goes to that they must have sin in their life said but who sinned this man or his parents but notice Jesus's words none of them but this was done for the glory of the Lord ain't amazing how Satan can make you feel guilty because of your children maybe they maybe they're just not where they need to be at yet Hallelujah I'm I'm a preach right here ain't it amazing how Satan can make you feel so guilty because maybe your children are not living up to par just yet or maybe maybe they haven't got their healing just yet oh it's on you it's on you but Jesus turns around and gives an answer to your question it ain't your fault it ain't your fault it ain't your fault they're blind it ain't your fault that they are where they are but this was done so that I could be glorified Shake That devil off of you Shake him off of you it ain't your fault it ain't your fault don't you worry about it God's about to do something bigger than you can imagine oh Jerry clar told a story one time okay to quote Jerry clar tonight I figure y'all all right with it y'all my people Jerry clar told about this farmer one time he told about this farmer that his his mule got knock down in there and knock down in a whale and fell down in that hole fell down in a hole and he looked for him all over his farm and couldn't find him and walked around and finally found him down there he was he hauling down there in that in that well and he thought well I guess I better bury him he a't no way I'm getting him out of there who thought Jerry clar could get mixed in mixed up in this he I guess I better bury him down there so he starts taking a shovel and starts burying him up but that old mule down there that old donkey every single time he throw he throw a little bit of dirt on him he just shake it off so the farmer said well it's going to take me all day to bury this guy every single time that dirt fall on top of him he just shake it off of him and before long he looked down in there and that mule that donkey he was shaking it off every single time he shake it off and he step up and the farmer started to realize real quick the more I throw that dirt in there the quicker he's going to get out of this hole so I'm saying this to you shake it off and step up Shake It Off Shake It Off Shake It Off Satan poured it on you shake it off the more it pours on you shake it off well blessed be the name of the Lord if a mes got that much knowledge how much more as Sons and Daughters of God should we have the power to take what Satan has tried to put on us as flaws and mistakes Shake It Off Of You Step Up step up you ain't as bad as you are as you think you [Applause] are I got to reading this today I'm about to have myself a conniption fit not Jerry clar when you go to reading John chapter n you you go studying the Greek out especially for a hillbilly like me you get to studying those things out it breaks down things in a whole another level than I can hardly read and when I see those things it makes me about tear tear a cabin apart make it look like toothpicks but when Jesus when Jesus was standing there in John chapter n mam said it in one place he said it like this that Jesus had preached so much that there was a puddle of spit sitting there to think that the author the spoken word was sitting there preaching he's preaching about this blind man preaching about this blind man he's got this condition in his life and he's and he's preaching about it and he spits on the ground and and when you go to studying that out that that he took the ground if you break it down in the Greek it means a fissure it means a flaw but Jesus Took a flaw and put it on the flaw and anointed his eyes he took a flaw and put it on a flaw and showed that a masterpiece was in the making he took a flaw and made it into Perfection what was he showing he was showing that elements that were not sufficient to be claimed as worthy that he can make them worthy so that it would produce perfection in your Humanity there are all types of flaws forgive me I saw you battling this last weekend sister Devin I know I know Satan battles you and it's real it's a real TR crap it's a real war for you but don't let it just be your your War because s because you're so fresh Satan makes you think that you're the only one here with flaws but I'd say that if all of us are real honest here [Applause] tonight but because you're maybe fresher Satan makes you feel like you got flaws makes you feel like you're the only one that that's battling the way that you are maybe that's your case maybe that's where you are but I'd say that every single one of us have flaws in our life that if we could look back in our Humanity but the thing of it is as a veteran you're you recognize that the blood is greater than your flaws but maybe if I can identify it to you like this because I've been where you've been and I saw you battling like you are and that's all right don't you ever let your past be bigger than your future but if if I could just put it in this way your flaws your mistakes if you didn't have it if you didn't have it if you didn't have it laying there the reason why you appreciate the sunshine is because the rain and because you appreciate the rain you appreciate the sunshine you understand the contrast of it and because of your flaws because of of your Humanity it keeps you always in hunger I just spend one on the devil for you he's been trying to bury you up with your flaw but your flaw is what keeps you close to the master without your flaw you wouldn't need the master but but when the flaw was seen then brother brandom said it was the Masterpiece what happened at Calvary when Christ was struck on the side he was perfect in every way he was born without sin he never lied he never told he never had a mistake in his life he was perfect he his his blood was perfect he was neither blood he was neither the blood of Jew nor Gentile he was perfection in himself but what makes him Jesus to me brother Jonathan is the flaw because when he was smot on his side you see what the enemy thought he was doing for evil when they smoted him on the side it brought me out it showed that I was redeemable Hallelujah God is not looking at your mistakes God is not looking at your imperfections he is looking at his promise to you Samson was a man he was a red blooded man fell in sin and so to David but God was not looking at Samson's sin what happened Samson had sin in his life but when the Philistines came in there what did he do he reached back there and touch the promise Hallelujah you see God is not concerned with your flaw and your Humanity he is concerned with his promise and I'm not giving you a license to sin but I'm telling you that your flaw shows that there was a Calvary that Jesus did not die in vain Hallelujah but I want you to know this this that Satan is always trying to find the flaw in humanity is this okay tonight he's always trying to find the flaw in humanity he's trying to look at some way to put a complex on an individual to mark his or her life and Mark it up in such a way that he that there there maybe they're that he could point out that they have a marred history you could look at Ruth you could look at Tamar you could look at Rahab but Satan is always trying to put a Mark or a flaw or find that flaw because if he can find that flaw he could turn around and say Well they're not worthy to be a believer or this brother is not able to preach because he's got an imperfection in his life or in in he's got a imperfection in his natural Humanity he can't he can't walk like other people he can't talk like other people that's the same way Moses was he had all kinds of imperfections but God was his absolute in it all but Satan is always trying to point out point out scriptures to make you feel and point out things in the scripture that he knows that you can't live up to so he points out scriptures in there to make you feel flawed by the word because he knows that Matthew 5:48 tells us to be therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect he knows you can't live up to that Satan knows you can't live up to that but I got good news for you you don't have to be be [Applause] perfect news flash you don't have to be perfect you can go through menopause and not be perfect you can go through trials of life and midlife crisises and not be perfect you can go through teenage years and not be perfect you don't have to be perfect because the Bible said in Hebrews 10:14 Heath therefore perfect perfected forever the them that are Sanctified so let me say this to you the only way that you can't be perfect is outside of the blood of Jesus Christ because if you really want to go Old Testament on this you wouldn't even allowed to come into the congregation four generations back if you had sin in your life but one time in the blood of Jesus Christ dipped in there makes you accessible to go into the presence of the Shana Glory brother Bon one time brother Bon one time he was you can go and listen to this you can go and listen to this in a masterpiece brother brandom goes in there and he there's a man there's a minister that come to him and he tells him he's said now look why are you constantly balling people out you're always balling the women out for their short hair and wearing shorts and all those things and don't you know that those people regard you as a prophet don't you know they regard you as a servant of the Lord Brother Bon said I said Lord give me an answer give me an answer so that I can answer this smart individual here and brother B said did you ever hear about the great producer of music Beethoven and he said well yeah he said he said you do realize that he gave one of the greatest masterpieces to the world through his inspiration he said but do you realize how many waste baskets full of scrap paper that he had tossed into a bin that's right and the man couldn't say one thing to him because he knew you see you might not agree with everything that your pastor's putting on you and it might cut and it might hurt but at the end of it it will produce a masterpiece you see because Beethoven had had an inspiration dropped in his heart and brother brandom said he prayed about it he prayed about it and he went into his room and he would begin to draw it all out and he would get get to a spot and it wouldn't match his inspiration and he would ball it up and he would throw it in the waist basket he would do it again and he would throw it in the waste basket Hallelujah you might get mad at me and you might get B mad at brother Ron but when the preaching of the word Goes Forth it might cut you it might hurt you but I want you to know at the end of it it's working all things for the good to them that love God and everybody may not be up to par like you are up to speed and your angelic wings but at the end of the result there'll be a masterpiece by the preaching of the word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you said brother Andrew but I just don't know how much I got left in me I don't know how much more I can press I don't know how much more I can persevere let's be honest here we all we all thought in our Humanity that God would have healed sister Erica in this life and you see those things you begin to think you begin to think about it and Satan begins to come in and Whisper was all you're praying was it in vain you spent all those hours praying it wasn't worth it are you kidding me are you kidding me how many times in prayer did we go to prayer for sister Erica and out of those prayer rooms came Sons and Daughters of God coming back to the house of the Lord how many times did you get into the presence of the Lord maybe praying for this one or praying for that one that God allowed you to tap into prayer and all of a sudden out of it begin to break Visions or Revelations and things that you haven't seen before and you might say I don't know how much more I can go I don't know how much more I got left in the tank I want you to say I want you to know that what you got left is more than enough if all you got just a little bit left I want you to know it's enough because when Elijah showed up at the Widow's house and all she had was a little bit of meal and a little bit of oil it was enough it was enough to get her out of a famine hallelujah what this said God takes what you got left and he brings it and makes it enough when you go to reading Exodus chapter 9 and you go to reading about all the Miracles that took place what happened in Exodus chapter 9 when you before you see the boils and the blaes begin to break out over all the men what happens God commands Aaron to take ashes off of the sacrifice what is a what is ashes it's what's left over it's what's left over and he come commands him take of the ashes sprinkle it in the air and because of the ashes there went out a cloud over all of Egypt it was more than enough what you got left is more than enough you may not feel it like that person feels it but I want you to know what I'm saying is Right On Target because they might feel like they're at the end of the rope and they feel like they're getting ready to give in but what you got left is enough to get you through you're not going to barely make it you're not going to give in you're not going to give up Hallelujah You Got What It Takes Elijah was everything the Widow had need of Hallelujah what came out of his side of Calvary may it look like what was left but it was enough look at Exodus CH 12 what he tell them take the blood take what's left put it over the door put it over the door what was it the blood was a sign that it had enough power to keep the death angel away and to get two million out of Egypt what am I saying to you that the token is everything that you have need of to get out of lay osia it's high time that you recognize that the token is everything that's right brother baram said he said it in this way he said the message is the token the message is the token what is it what is the message brother Ang why do y'all always going to church it's Christ had an individual say this to us what is the message been in the message 30 years what really is the message I thought dear God have you said here that long not here not here but from a different place have you sat here so long that you don't realize the message what's Church to you brother Chris what's Church to you sister Brenda what's church it's Christ yeah there's some people that don't need as much church as you need because they can't show up we real clear here tonight what have they got brother Andrew brother Brandon would say like this they got teacup religion they get so full they only want a 15 minute and they don't want to preacher to preach to him very loud and they want don't want him to say a man and they don't want him to scream or holler he said but I'm tired of seeing sermonettes by preacher ATS well I don't know about y'all Full Gospel Lighthouse but ain't too many teacups sitting around here and I don't believe that God's looking for teacup religion I don't know how we got there but we got there but what is church what's church about what's a sermon really what's a song about come on what's praise about what's singing about what dancing about come on somebody it's about Christ your flaws are perfected in Christ Hallelujah I got all these flaws in my life brother Andel let me tell you the higher you praise the more you forget about your flaws the higher you pray the higher you sing the higher you dance the more you forget about your flaws so what church it's about getting the flaws out of your life really what what are we what are we holding on to I done pre I done preach this it's a very it's a I don't know if you feel it in the room or not but this is a dynamic service but was Jesus standing there in the house and he called them and he tells him you've made my house a denes what was he telling them that he was a reason for church he was a reason for it and there they were looking at the message they were looking at the message but they couldn't see him because they was still behind the veiled of him and the rest of the world don't understand like you understand but because you have stepped behind the veil that God has come on the inside of your Badger skins he looked at mo mo Michaelangelo looked at his Moses and he said speak and they couldn't speak back to him but God looked at Jesus and it could speak and what did it say father forgive them for they know not what they do but notice Michelangelo when he smoted him he could not put back what he had already done but your Prophet said that God is going to reproduce Jesus Christ in this day he's putting the flaw back in its original place and he's looking at you
